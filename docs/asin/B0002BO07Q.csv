829812,A209QRVZ99UQDC,B0002BO07Q,Calamity Jane,"[93, 108]","PBS should have stopped this fiasco the moment the players refused to play by the rules of the 1600's.20st century selfishness destroyed this program. What mattered to the players was not what they could do for the community, but how they could  please themselves, yet still play the game. The strict rules were ignored and mocked, which made nonsense of the entire production.In Colonial times you either went to church or you went to your death.  The Colonists were highly religious people. That one family chose skinny-dipping over church services on Sunday was ludicrous. They should have stayed home and let another family experience this once-in-a-lifetime adventure.After getting to church you certainly wouldn't tell everyone you were homosexual and expect to survive. But a gay young man decided to out himself one morning prior to service. He was embraced 20th Century style, but would have been stoned 17th century style. He's another one who should have stayed home.Another young man, bored with the century, left the community and sought out a local pub, a serious no-no according to producers. He later returned to the colony, bragged about his adventures and picked up where he left off. Yawn.Tisdale, an African-American, couldn't handle the manual labor or his sudden desire to enslave others to do his work. He walked off the show with a frightening and depressing understanding of why slavery came into existence.The most offensive scene was when the local Indians paid the colonists a visit, only to berate them for what their ancestors had done to ""their people"". That insulting conversation would never have taken place inside a homesteader's cabin while the homesteaders grinned and apologized for the white man's actions.As far as offering a peek into 1600 living, Colonial House offers little to nothing. A much better production was FRONTIER HOUSE in which the participants adhered to the rules and regs of the pioneer days.",1,Laughable at Best,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,1950,"['PBS', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'moment', 'players', 'refused', 'play', 'rules', ""1600's.20st"", 'century', 'selfishness', 'destroyed', 'program', 'What', 'mattered', 'players', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'community', 'how', 'could', 'please', 'yet', 'still', 'play', 'game', 'strict', 'rules', 'were', 'ignored', 'mocked', 'made', 'nonsense', 'entire', 'production.In', 'Colonial', 'went', 'church', 'went', 'death', 'Colonists', 'were', 'highly', 'religious', 'people', 'one', 'family', 'chose', 'skinny-dipping', 'church', 'services', 'Sunday', 'was', 'ludicrous', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'home', 'let', 'family', 'experience', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'adventure.After', 'getting', 'church', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'tell', 'everyone', 'were', 'homosexual', 'expect', 'survive', 'gay', 'young', 'man', 'decided', 'one', 'morning', 'prior', 'service', 'was', 'embraced', '20th', 'Century', 'style', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stoned', '17th', 'century', 'style', 'one', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'young', 'man', 'bored', 'century', 'left', 'community', 'sought', 'out', 'local', 'pub', 'serious', 'no-no', 'according', 'producers', 'later', 'returned', 'colony', 'bragged', 'adventures', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'Yawn.Tisdale', 'African-American', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'manual', 'labor', 'sudden', 'desire', 'enslave', 'others', 'do', 'work', 'walked', 'off', 'show', 'frightening', 'depressing', 'understanding', 'why', 'slavery', 'came', 'existence.The', 'most', 'offensive', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'local', 'Indians', 'paid', 'colonists', 'visit', 'only', 'berate', 'what', 'ancestors', 'had', 'done', 'people', 'insulting', 'conversation', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'homesteader', 'cabin', 'homesteaders', 'grinned', 'apologized', 'white', 'man', 'actions.As', 'far', 'offering', 'peek', '1600', 'living', 'Colonial', 'House', 'little', 'nothing', 'much', 'better', 'production', 'was', 'FRONTIER', 'HOUSE', 'participants', 'adhered', 'rules', 'regs', 'pioneer', 'days']",N/A

Most people were people under bad economical conditions already, and came looking for opportunities to do better.They were sponsored by investors.Investors were expecting a payback, which was a very hard for colonists to do as they barely could survive themselves. About half of the colonies were not successful.Also, I found it interesting, that neither of the men only colonies were successful. I don't think it was the cooking, it was love(I don't mean romantic kind).There is still some ego fights in Colonial House, but much less than in Regency one.I disliked both Lady Vorhee and Governor-they both seemed to be quite fanatic and standing so strongly behind their opinions about religion like their personal value depended on that. That said, it is not easy to live every waking moment for 4 months doing something, that you don't believe in. At the beginning of the dvd I was thinking it would have been cool to do this, but by the end I thought -phew, I am glad I wasn't one of them. One week-maybe fun, more- too much.One interesting thing was, that people do tend to be not too nice than given power over someone even temporarily -  minister's wife was ordering servants around like they were puppies.I think it would have been more fun to give servants roles to minister and governor(who were ordering people around in their real lives too) to give them a chance to be under.Overall, I think, it was very informative and interesting show.",4,Much better than Regency House,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,2003,"['So', 'far', 'watched', 'just', 'Regency', 'Colonial', 'ones', 'feel', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'colonist', 'lives', 'much', 'out', 'lot', 'what', 'are', 'told', 'history', 'books', 'are', 'myths-', 'turkey', 'dinner', 'Thanksgiving', 'colonists', 'were', 'having', 'party', 'indians', 'went', 'keep', 'relations', 'better', 'Indians', 'agreed', 'eat', 'never', 'repeated', 'most', 'likely', 'was', 'turkey', 'involved', 'either', '.And', 'Natives', 'Thanksgiving', 'day', 'mourning.Also', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'arrived', 'were', 'not', 'puritans', 'Most', 'people', 'were', 'people', 'bad', 'economical', 'conditions', 'already', 'came', 'looking', 'opportunities', 'do', 'better.They', 'were', 'sponsored', 'investors.Investors', 'were', 'expecting', 'payback', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'colonists', 'do', 'barely', 'could', 'survive', 'half', 'colonies', 'were', 'not', 'successful.Also', 'found', 'interesting', 'men', 'only', 'colonies', 'were', 'successful', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'cooking', 'was', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'romantic', 'kind', 'still', 'ego', 'fights', 'Colonial', 'House', 'much', 'less', 'Regency', 'one.I', 'disliked', 'Lady', 'Vorhee', 'Governor-they', 'seemed', 'be', 'quite', 'fanatic', 'standing', 'so', 'strongly', 'opinions', 'religion', 'personal', 'value', 'depended', 'said', 'not', 'easy', 'live', 'waking', 'moment', '4', 'months', 'doing', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'beginning', 'dvd', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'do', 'end', 'thought', '-phew', 'am', 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'One', 'week-maybe', 'fun', 'more-', 'too', 'much.One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'was', 'people', 'do', 'tend', 'be', 'not', 'too', 'nice', 'given', 'power', 'someone', 'even', 'temporarily', 'minister', 'wife', 'was', 'ordering', 'servants', 'were', 'puppies.I', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'give', 'servants', 'roles', 'minister', 'governor', 'who', 'were', 'ordering', 'people', 'real', 'lives', 'too', 'give', 'chance', 'be', 'under.Overall', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'informative', 'interesting', 'show']",N/A
829816,A2BLITJITO97N5,B0002BO07Q,Ingalls,"[17, 36]","Unlike the excellent ""Frontier House,"" this series was a joke and makes it clear that political correctness has gone so far with liberals that empirical data, facts, and history no longer matter and that these will be quickly junked and dismissed if they conflict with the dogmas of the left (which PBS has become a mindless shrine to). This could have been an educational, entertaining look at history. Instead, we have a farce where atheists are publicly very vocal about their infidelity (in 1660!) without any punishment; where gays come out of the closet at church and get applauded for their personal courage (is this colonial America or the Phil Donahue show?); where African-Americans are members of the colony of English Puritans (what's next? A disabled, wheelchair bound individual demanding handicap access to the meeting hall? How about - just to keep the anachronistic diversity at suitably absurd levels - an hispanic female cleric leading the congregation???!!!). Years from now (I hope), this series will be mocked as a sick symptom of our time - a time so tongue-tied and intellectually chained by political correctness that facts can't even be publicly spoken about lest some (well trained by the school system) individual complains about being offended - as if facts need to be ditched if someone doesn't like them.

Harken back to the days where you actually had to kill what you put on the dinner table. Where a woman's identity is entirely dependent on her husband. Where life becomes more real as the modern convieniences that allow us to hide ourselves are taken away, and we are forced to deal with things head on.  PBS maginificent ""Colonial House"" offers a quick taste of those days, in their horrible reality.Last year, a band of brave people were selected to live in a small colony in Maine during the summer of 2003 to see what life was like in the 1620's. Picked from a wide variety of people, they are forced to deal with the rules and restrictions such people had to endure. Spicing up this mix is a twenty first century mentality that often rubs against their own attempt at life, producing an intriguing mix of television not often seen.The people picked to be on the show are very real, and adapt into their roles easily. From the governor who struggles with the leadership of the colony, to the indentured servants, who operate under their masters whims, each plays their parts perfectly, allowing glimpses into the reality of 17th century lives. While I really enjoyed all of the people, my favorites had to be servant Jonathan Allen, Julia Friese, and the rebellious Voorhees'. They added the most spice to this spicy adventure!So a reality show where people don't get voted off, or a phone number where you call to vote for your favorite singer. But this is an intelligent attempt to model life back then. Is it perfect? No. But the lessons learned by the colonists, about themselves and life in early America, resonate loud and clear. That's intelligent television at its best.Bravo to PBS for taking this risk, and I highly recommend anyone and everyone to view this wonderful work.",5,Colonial Life's Essence,1098144000,"10 19, 2004",2004,1893,"['Long', 'return', 'good', 'ol', 'days', 'Waxing', 'nostalgic', 'election', 'season', 'Well', 'look', 'further', 'Harken', 'back', 'days', 'where', 'actually', 'had', 'kill', 'what', 'put', 'dinner', 'table', 'Where', 'woman', 'identity', 'entirely', 'dependent', 'husband', 'Where', 'life', 'more', 'real', 'modern', 'convieniences', 'allow', 'hide', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'are', 'forced', 'deal', 'things', 'head', 'PBS', 'maginificent', 'Colonial', 'House', 'quick', 'taste', 'days', 'horrible', 'reality.Last', 'year', 'band', 'brave', 'people', 'were', 'selected', 'live', 'small', 'colony', 'Maine', 'summer', '2003', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'was', '1620', 'Picked', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'deal', 'rules', 'restrictions', 'such', 'people', 'had', 'endure', 'Spicing', 'up', 'mix', 'twenty', 'first', 'century', 'mentality', 'often', 'rubs', 'own', 'attempt', 'life', 'producing', 'intriguing', 'mix', 'television', 'not', 'often', 'seen.The', 'people', 'picked', 'be', 'show', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'adapt', 'roles', 'easily', 'governor', 'who', 'leadership', 'colony', 'indentured', 'servants', 'who', 'operate', 'masters', 'whims', 'plays', 'parts', 'perfectly', 'allowing', 'glimpses', 'reality', '17th', 'century', 'lives', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'favorites', 'had', 'be', 'servant', 'Jonathan', 'Allen', 'Julia', 'Friese', 'rebellious', 'Voorhees', 'added', 'most', 'spice', 'spicy', 'adventure', 'So', 'reality', 'show', 'where', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'voted', 'off', 'phone', 'number', 'where', 'call', 'vote', 'favorite', 'singer', 'intelligent', 'attempt', 'model', 'life', 'back', 'then', 'perfect', 'No', 'lessons', 'learned', 'colonists', 'life', 'early', 'America', 'resonate', 'loud', 'clear', 'intelligent', 'television', 'best.Bravo', 'PBS', 'taking', 'risk', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'view', 'wonderful', 'work']",N/A
829818,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,B0002BO07Q,"Joe Owen ""Joe""","[0, 0]","This interesting series produced by PBS in 2004 is about how a group of modern day Americans ""go back in time"" and live like the new English Immigrants of 1628 arriving in America with almost nothing except the clothes on their backs.  The families and single people live for 5 months literally like the colonials of 1628.  Hard labor from sunnup to sunset, farming, fishing, making colonial cabins, and substinance living at that.  They filmed the series on the Maine coast and the technology was 17th Century technology.Some families adapted better than other families, and some single people adapted better than other single people.  It was a shock to see how primitive life was.  It was filmed during the summer of 2004 and the ""village"" had to produce enough food to last thru the winter.  Modern people from all walks of life were in the series and it is fascinating to see them adapt to life of the early 17th Century.  Modern Americans have it vastly more easy compared to 400 years ago.  Modern Americans could NOT survive a month living in 1628, excpet maybe if you were used to hunting with a musket and could live off the land.  In an interesting twist, Native Americans were introduced in a few episodes (decendants of Native Americans who lived in New England), they traded with the Colonial Village just like they would have 400 years ago.Living conditions were harsh, no plumbing, harsh sanitation (flies, bugs, mold, filth), when it rained everything got soaked.  Cramped living conditions, servitude (some single people were endentured servants).  After 5 months the families and single people were evaluated to see if what they did during the summer could make them survive during the winter.  Mostly, the village failed but not due to lack of working hard and trying.  There were alot more circumstances in the series than I can review in this review.  Celebrity Oprah Winfrey and her friend Gail visited the village for a weekend and had to live like 17th Century colonials.After watching this series, it is amazing to think how Colonial Americans were able to survive and later prosper under such conditions.  They must of been ""hearty stock"" and character of steel to survive such conditions.  This is a great series and I highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to know what live was like in the ""good old days"" of Colonial America.",4,"Colonial House - A step back in time to the ""good old days"" was not an easy life",1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,2363,"['interesting', 'series', 'produced', 'PBS', '2004', 'how', 'group', 'modern', 'day', 'Americans', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'live', 'new', 'English', 'Immigrants', '1628', 'arriving', 'America', 'almost', 'nothing', 'clothes', 'backs', 'families', 'single', 'people', 'live', '5', 'months', 'literally', 'colonials', '1628', 'Hard', 'labor', 'sunnup', 'sunset', 'farming', 'fishing', 'making', 'colonial', 'cabins', 'substinance', 'living', 'filmed', 'series', 'Maine', 'coast', 'technology', 'was', '17th', 'Century', 'technology.Some', 'families', 'adapted', 'better', 'other', 'families', 'single', 'people', 'adapted', 'better', 'other', 'single', 'people', 'was', 'shock', 'see', 'how', 'primitive', 'life', 'was', 'was', 'filmed', 'summer', '2004', 'village', 'had', 'produce', 'enough', 'food', 'last', 'thru', 'winter', 'Modern', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'were', 'series', 'fascinating', 'see', 'adapt', 'life', 'early', '17th', 'Century', 'Modern', 'Americans', 'have', 'vastly', 'more', 'easy', 'compared', '400', 'years', 'ago', 'Modern', 'Americans', 'could', 'NOT', 'survive', 'month', 'living', '1628', 'maybe', 'were', 'used', 'hunting', 'musket', 'could', 'live', 'off', 'land', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Native', 'Americans', 'were', 'introduced', 'few', 'episodes', 'decendants', 'Native', 'Americans', 'who', 'lived', 'New', 'England', 'traded', 'Colonial', 'Village', 'just', 'would', 'have', '400', 'years', 'ago.Living', 'conditions', 'were', 'harsh', 'plumbing', 'harsh', 'sanitation', 'flies', 'bugs', 'mold', 'filth', 'when', 'rained', 'everything', 'got', 'soaked', 'Cramped', 'living', 'conditions', 'servitude', 'single', 'people', 'were', 'endentured', 'servants', '5', 'months', 'families', 'single', 'people', 'were', 'evaluated', 'see', 'what', 'did', 'summer', 'could', 'make', 'survive', 'winter', 'Mostly', 'village', 'failed', 'not', 'due', 'lack', 'working', 'hard', 'trying', 'were', 'alot', 'more', 'circumstances', 'series', 'can', 'review', 'review', 'Celebrity', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'friend', 'Gail', 'visited', 'village', 'weekend', 'had', 'live', '17th', 'Century', 'colonials.After', 'watching', 'series', 'amazing', 'think', 'how', 'Colonial', 'Americans', 'were', 'able', 'survive', 'later', 'prosper', 'such', 'conditions', 'must', 'been', 'hearty', 'stock', 'character', 'steel', 'survive', 'such', 'conditions', 'great', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'live', 'was', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Colonial', 'America']",N/A

I thought 1900 House was good, Manor House was better, and Frontier House was excellent. I figured by having a whole colony of people, this would be the ultimate living history. Unfortunately, this was not to be. My biggest question is did the Voorhees family even read the rules on the application, or did they go just to prove how 21st century they really are? I mean, she didn't even TRY to live by the 1628 laws. Skinny dipping on the Sabbath? In 1628? INSTEAD OF CHURCH?? And how about Jonathon Allen? To really feel as if it were 1628, and to prove to all he would abide by rules of days gone by, Mr. Allen should have kept his homosexuality a secret until the final day, and especially to not come out in church! That would have proved to all that you were truly trying to live by 1628 laws. Come on folks! If this were truly the seventeenth century, both subjects would have been burned at the stake! If you're going to sign up for a project like this at least TRY to abide by the laws and rules of the times!! That's the whole point - to see if a 21st century human could survive in a different time period. If you want to skinny dip, fine. If you're gay, fine. But neither was acceptable in the time period you were attempting to live in. Even the British guy ventured off to the future for a couple of days to go drinking in a modern pub. Why did you all sign up? To promote your political agendas? This is not a knock at anyone's lifestyle - this is a frustrated viewer and lover of experiments like these ""House"" shows. All you proved to those of us watching was that you all couldn't hack it. So you decided to make it almost into a 1960's commune instead of a 1628 colony.To me, the attitude of the Voorhees family really brought the whole project down. Their 21st century ideals spread like a disease to the others in the colony except the first Governor, who was chastised by the rest for truly following the rules of 1628.At least the participants in the past ""House"" series, for the most part, made an attempt to live in the chosen period of which they were selected.I sure hope the powers that be are a little more selective in choosing people for any future experimental ""living in the past"" House shows.

Johnson,"[1, 2]","Can one take a group of modern Americans (plus on Brit), plant them on the coast of New England, and have them build a brave new world as their ancestors had in 1628? &#60;Pfft&#62; No. They didn&#8217;t even try.This 2004 PBS show represents five months filming on the coast of Maine, and marks a low-point in their creative programming. The people involved in this project included a Baptist minister &#8211; now, you would expect him to be cast in the role of the colony&#8217;s minister right? Wrong. Instead, he was given the role of colonial governor. The role of minister was given to a liberal professor of religious studies. The entire colony was filled with people with chips on their shoulders, who evidently never did intend to live by the 1628 rules.All that I can figure is that the creators of the show wanted the governor to turn into a tyrant and force the people to act correctly &#8211; as no doubt a real 1628 governor would have. Heck, even a real-life management consultant slipped in to reign in the cast of rejects failed utterly to turn things around. The visit by a local Native-American tribe had all of the warmth of a visit by the Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution &#8211; something that it greatly resembled.No, all I can say is that the creators of this dog of a show planned to have it fail spectacularly, and all it did was splutter and lay down and die. I generally love the similar reality shows, including 1900 House and Frontier House, but this one I hated. It could have been a great show like the others, it should have been a great show like the others, but it&#8217;s not a great show, or a good show, or even a fair one.

829821,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B0002BO07Q,Michael Valdivielso,"[8, 10]","I got Colonial House after watching Frontier House and posting a review of the DVD set on Amazon.  I wanted to see the rest of the House series and bought up both Colonial House and Texas Ranch House.  Colonial House seems to have many people, as you can see from the reviews, who hate it.  But there are some good points and some bad points.  First, let us talk about the set up.17 people are sent, after some training, to live on a 1000 acres of wild country in Maine.  They have to go by boat, they don't know what parts they will play before they get there - governor, freeman, servant - and, luckily for them, most of the town has already been built, the land cleared, and even the animals already transported to the spot.  They just have to unload the boat that held their supplies and belongings.  So they didn't have to spend two months building the houses.  In the end they had four months to prepare to be judged - would they survive or be forced to return to England?  Could they survive 1628?  Or is it 1682?  The DVD set box says 1682 but everybody else says 1628.  Mistake or warning of things to come? Dun-dun-DUN!The Good: They do seem to be able to adapt to the methods, equipment and ways of 17th Century colonists.  They plant and grow corn, they built a new house when 8 more people are sent to help the colony, they collect material and foods and use the resources available to them.  Some of the people, like Jeff Wyers, his daughter Bethany Wyers, Julia Friese and Don Wood all show a lot of backbone.  They show inner strength to do what is right, a willingness to work hard and, sometimes, a sense of humor that  is refreshing.  They even, sometimes, try to think like a person of the 17th Century.  The Wyers family kept to the rules EVEN after all the real life problems they had.I also liked Jack Lecza, Cape Merchant, who was sent to help them prepare for the winter and the final judgment.  He knew his history but he also knew about the resources, how to use them, and how to work with people.The fact that they are so FAR from modern society is a plus - but did not stop one person from taking a break - see The Bad.The Bad: Sometimes the Americans forgot about the fact that some of the people in the project were English.  So when they talked about our nation this and Americans that I wondered if they remembered that they were 17th Century English colonists.  I felt sorry for the English, frankly.While many people adjusted to no bathrooms, no modern devices, no forks, yet few seemed to adjust to the 17th mindset.  They could not stay within the 17th Century.  Many kept pulling 21th Century values and ideas into the project and it made for some moments where you wanted to shake them and ask, why are you here?  If you didn't want to do this, why did you come?  Many people started to drink too much, they played baseball, they can be seen just laying about.  Skinny-dipping?  Infighting?  Tons of meeting and why did they come all the way to the New World without corn seeds?One Freeman went walk about - in fact he went to a nearby town, went to a bar and got free food and drink.  Not only was he breaking the rules but he even promised that while away from the village he was NOT going to leave the 1000 acres.  Which he did anyway.Another Freeman just left after wondering if he was helping bring about slavery.  Maybe he adapted to the 17th Century mindset too easily?Also, with over 20 people in the project near the end I wanted more input from the other members of the village.  But we barely see anybody outside the three main families.  That sucks.  I think they wanted to focus on two types of people - the ones who were major players and the trouble makers.  Oh, the drama!The Ugly:  First one up to bat is, of course, Michelle Rossi-Voorhees.  Funny enough the rest of her family did pretty good and, I think, outside of her everybody else in her family, and in the colony, came away from the project having learned something.  She did not.  She got drunk.  She got high off the pipe.  She complained, shouted at people, refused to go to church.  And the thing that really made me feel sad for her was her stating that she felt sorry for Bethany because the girl BELIVED in God.  I think I respected Bethany Wyers the most and if she could find comfort and strength in God that is no business of Michelle's.  The drunk, pipe smoking, skinny-dipping witch.Most of the time I found the Heinz family interesting.  One day they said one thing and the next they switched over to say something else.  Carolyn complained about the rules and how things were run at first.  But all that changed when her husband was put in power and then she complained about how nobody was following the rules.  And they treated every camera as if it was their own private camera.The project, in the end was interesting, but also seemed to get twisted into knots.  Issues of church, slavery, work, food got mixed in with the rights of women, the rights of servants, debates of freedom, and the need for some private time.  In other words 17th Century issues got muddled by 21st Century whining.Final note - it is not as bad as some reviews seem to say - I think many people got emotional if not outright mad at a few of the people in the project and that carries over into the reviews.  It is good but I don't think it was as interesting as Frontier House.  I think if properly done it could have been MUCH better then Frontier House.  The DVD set also came with extras in the form of a making of, auditions and more diaries.",3,Getting a pipe high...wha?,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,5555,"['got', 'Colonial', 'House', 'watching',

Too bad it was so short!I would have liked to see more of the ""pioneers'"" lives and what they did all day. The fact that by the end of the project they were still mostly eating peas, porridge, and salted fish/pork instead of vegetables from their gardens confirms my suspicion that they were spending more time arguing than working.I think the colony would have fared better if the Vorhees family had not been part of it. Mrs. Vorhees said right in the beginning that they were only in the project because they wanted to ""live closer to the land"". In my opinion, this statement shows such a lack of community spirit that they should have been excluded. All the other people seemed to be willing to do their best to live according to 17th century rules, but after the Vorhees' refusal to participate in the Sunday gatherings, the community basically fell apart, even before the governor and his family left.Overall, I think this was not meant as an experimental archaeology type of production. Instead, the producers were more interested in bringing conflicts to the screen, which is why they chose people from diverse social and religious backgrounds (the other main reason for being chosen was obviously physical attractiveness).

This time we have several families and individuals sent to live on the New England coastline as colonists in the New World. They encounter struggles from how to make money, how to ration their food, how to handle the religious and social customs, and how to trade with natives. It is an ambitious project that spans over eight hour long episodes.The main problem with this installment is that the participants seemed so unwilling to comply to the rules. Several people decided it was unimportant to attend church on the Sabbath, a crime punishable by death in some places. They did not take wearing their scarlet letters seriously, nor did they comply with the governor's laws. The women refused to be quiet and docile and one man even left for civilization for a day. It is difficult to care about the individual people because there are so many; only a few people are given a lot of individual screen time. To add to this problem, some people leave early, one group because of a family emergency. It is very telling when in the last episode, the camera crew goes back to check up on only a few of the participants after the project is over.This edition is entertaining, but it is by no means as good as the other House programs.",3,Why Did They Sign Up?,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1386,"['Colonial', 'House', 'PBS', 'House', 'series', 'wonderful', 'reality', 'show', 'modern', 'day', 'families', 'back', 'time', 'experience', 'life', 'era', 'time', 'have', 'several', 'families', 'individuals', 'sent', 'live', 'New', 'England', 'coastline', 'colonists', 'New', 'World', 'encounter', 'struggles', 'how', 'make', 'money', 'how', 'ration', 'food', 'how', 'handle', 'religious', 'social', 'customs', 'how', 'trade', 'natives', 'ambitious', 'project', 'over', 'eight', 'hour', 'long', 'episodes.The', 'main', 'problem', 'installment', 'participants', 'seemed', 'so', 'unwilling', 'comply', 'rules', 'Several', 'people', 'decided', 'was', 'unimportant', 'attend', 'church', 'Sabbath', 'crime', 'punishable', 'death', 'places', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'wearing', 'scarlet', 'letters', 'seriously', 'did', 'comply', 'governor', 'laws', 'women', 'refused', 'be', 'quiet', 'docile', 'one', 'man', 'even', 'left', 'civilization', 'day', 'difficult', 'care', 'individual', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'only', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'given', 'lot', 'individual', 'screen', 'time', 'add', 'problem', 'people', 'leave', 'early', 'one', 'group', 'family', 'emergency', 'very', 'telling', 'when', 'last', 'episode', 'camera', 'crew', 'back', 'check', 'up', 'only', 'few', 'participants', 'project', 'over.This', 'edition', 'entertaining', 'means', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'House', 'programs']",N/A

Despite one over-dramatic episode at the end of disk 1, I felt he really did try to play his role quite well and he was quite likeable. I felt sorry for the governor trying to get people to conform to the rules and laws of the times.I did not care for the Vorhee family at all. Mr. & Mrs. Vorhee spent a great deal of time showboating, and I hated the part where they went skinnydipping instead of attending church like everyone else. If they want to lead 21rst century lives, why volunteer for this experiment? I felt they were a drag on the show, and the experiment would be better off without them, particularly Mrs. Vorhee whose irritating and shrewish opinions we were subjected to on a regular basis.Overall, not bad, although Manor House still remains my favorite.

829826,A29M09QBG9TZLP,B0002BO07Q,"Shana ""That's my opinion- I could be wrong!""","[8, 10]","The premise of ""Colonial House"" was supposed to be a 1600s working Puritan colony. A Puritan of 16th and 17th century England was a Protestant (usually Calvinist) a advocate of ""purity"" of worship, doctrine, and personal and group morality. The Puritan's stressed the importance of obtaining salvation through the development of an individual relationship with God (through the person of Jesus Christ) over attempting to obtain salvation through the sacraments and ceremonies of the church alone. Obviously, the observance of the Sabbath, religion and faith would've been an important part of a typical Puritan colony.A Puritan colony would've typically been comprised of people of similar faith, values and morals, all trying for a similar goal. The people PBS picked were anything but similar and they had no intention of even trying.It was interesting to see in the ""Making Of"" extra, that one of the producers said they had spent an extremely long time trying to find people who TRULY wanted to live the lives that THE PURITAN's lived in the 1600's. I can't imagine that they searched that hard. Many of the participants come across as extremely disagreeable & very selfish. Many of them selectively choose in which portions of early settler life they would like to participate and with which portions they can't be bothered. This was ludacris, because, they all knew before hand what was expected of them. I found myself thinking that it's a good thing our nation's survival didn't depend on them.The governor of the settlement (one of the only serious participants) really had no power to enforce the rules & as a result most of the participants tended to blatantly ignore the spirit of the experience. For example, one of the most difficult of the female participants wouldn't come to the Sunday Sabbath services (this was REQUIRED in a Puritan colony). It was an essential and mandatory part of Puritan settler life. She choose not to come because she doesn't believe in God, even tho, the Sabbath services held were made very non-comformist & very non-1600 Puritan to placate her. Before long 75% of the colonists are skipping the mandatory Sabbath. Then later, there was also a ""Jerry Springer-type"" moment of confession on one Sabbath day in a room full of young children, which in the 1600s a Puritan would've been burned for or at least kicked out of the colony. Before long no one was following even the smallest of the experiment's requirements.If the participants were more genuine and earnest about trying to live like the early Puritan settlers instead of constantly taking the viewer out of the experience with silly arguments & their spoiled brat behavior, this program would've been a lot better.If it hadn't been for the informative voice overs explaining interesting facts about early colonial life I wouldn't have continued after the 2nd episode. I will give it 3 stars for the voice overs and for the participants who did follow the spirit of the experiment.",3,It was supposed to be a PURITAN colony...not Jerry Springer-,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,2983,"['premise', 'Colonial', 'House', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', '1600s', 'working', 'Puritan', 'colony', 'Puritan', '16th', '17th', 'century', 'England', 'was', 'Protestant', 'usually', 'Calvinist', 'advocate', 'purity', 'worship', 'doctrine', 'personal', 'group', 'morality', 'Puritan', 'stressed', 'importance', 'obtaining', 'salvation', 'development', 'individual', 'relationship', 'God', 'person', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'attempting', 'obtain', 'salvation', 'sacraments', 'ceremonies', 'church', 'alone', 'Obviously', 'observance', 'Sabbath', 'religion', 'faith', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'important', 'part', 'typical', 'Puritan', 'colony.A', 'Puritan', 'colony', 'would', ""'ve"", 'typically', 'been', 'comprised', 'people', 'similar', 'faith', 'values', 'morals', 'trying', 'similar', 'goal', 'people', 'PBS', 'picked', 'were', 'anything', 'similar', 'had', 'intention', 'even', 'trying.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Making', 'extra', 'one', 'producers', 'said', 'had', 'spent', 'extremely', 'long', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'people', 'who', 'TRULY', 'wanted', 'live', 'lives', 'THE', 'PURITAN', 'lived', '1600', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'searched', 'hard', 'Many', 'participants', 'come', 'extremely', 'disagreeable', 'very', 'selfish', 'Many', 'selectively', 'choose', 'portions', 'early', 'settler', 'life', 'would', 'like', 'participate', 'portions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'was', 'ludacris', 'knew', 'hand', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'found', 'thinking', 'good', 'thing', 'nation', 'survival', 'did', ""n't"", 'depend', 'them.The', 'governor', 'settlement', 'one', 'only', 'serious', 'participants', 'really', 'had', 'power', 'enforce', 'rules', 'result', 'most', 'participants', 'tended', 'blatantly', 'ignore', 'spirit', 'experience', 'example', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'female', 'participants', 'would', ""n't"", 'come', 'Sunday', 'Sabbath', 'services', 'was', 'REQUIRED', 'Puritan', 'colony', 'was', 'essential', 'mandatory', 'part', 'Puritan', 'settler', 'life', 'choose', 'not', 'come', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God', 'even', 'tho', 'Sabbath', 'services', 'held', 'were', 'made', 'very', 'non-comformist', 'very', 'non-1600', 'Puritan', 'placate', 'long', '75', '%', 'colonists', 'are', 'skipping', 'mandatory', 'Sabbath', 'Then', 'later', 'was', 'also', 'Jerry', 'Springer-type', 'moment', 'confession', 'one', 'Sabbath', 'day', 'room', 'full', 'young', 'children', '1600s', 'Puritan', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'burned', 'least', 'kicked', 'colony', 'long', 'one', 'was', 'following', 'even', 'smallest', 'experiment', 'requirements.If', 'participants', 'were', 'more', 'genuine', 'earnest', 'trying', 'live', 'early', 'Puritan', 'settlers', 'instead', 'constantly', 'taking', 'viewer', 'experience', 'silly', 'arguments', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'behavior', 'program', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'informative', 'voice', 'overs', 'explaining', 'interesting', 'facts', 'early', 'colonial', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'continued', '2nd', 'episode', 'will', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'voice', 'overs', 'participants', 'who', 'did', 'follow', 'spirit', 'experiment']",N/A
829827,A1A043A4JU4T7B,B0002BO07Q,Stephen Elderbrock,"[14, 21]","I will acknowledge, as so many reviewers have, that ""Colonial House"" has its flaws - it turns out not to be a perfectly accurate portrayal of 1630.  But that is what I found so fascinating.  Because of the 21st century values that forced their way in, this series demonstrates so strongly how things have changed, for better and for worse, since 1630.  It also shows deeper than any history text how difficult life must have been for these colonists, and how miraculous it is that the values we hold dear today grew out of such a struggle.  These 21st century colonists struggle with more with the mental and spiritual chanllenges than they do with the physical ones - the issue of religion plays front and center in almost every episode.  I am a pastor, and I appreciated the portrayal of both sides of that struggle.  Although some of the people who skipped Sabbath and rebelled against the colony's laws were not being true to the rules of the project, their rebellion is only possible because of the fortitude of the very colonists whose laws they are ignoring.  I found this series the best of the PBS House series for that reason - the struggle between our century and the past seemed very real.  And educational.  Because of that struggle playing out in every moment, this series offers more than dressing up and role playing the past - it reveals the very essence of what makes this country great, and the risk of freedom at its essence.  As Jeff Wyers says at one point: ""These people are ungovernable"" -- and so we Americans so often are.  That struggle to govern in a nation based on individual liberty is at the heart of who we are, and it is on display quite poignantly in this series.",4,Understanding History By Seeing How We Have Changed,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,1698,"['will', 'acknowledge', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'Colonial', 'House', 'flaws', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'perfectly', 'accurate', 'portrayal', '1630', 'what', 'found', 'so', 'fascinating', '21st', 'century', 'values', 'forced', 'way', 'series', 'so', 'strongly', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'better', 'worse', '1630', 'also', 'deeper', 'history', 'text', 'how', 'difficult', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'colonists', 'how', 'miraculous', 'values', 'hold', 'dear', 'today', 'grew', 'out', 'such', 'struggle', '21st', 'century', 'colonists', 'struggle', 'more', 'mental', 'spiritual', 'chanllenges', 'do', 'physical', 'ones', 'issue', 'religion', 'plays', 'front', 'center', 'almost', 'episode', 'am', 'pastor', 'appreciated', 'portrayal', 'sides', 'struggle', 'people', 'who', 'skipped', 'Sabbath', 'rebelled', 'colony', 'laws', 'were', 'not', 'being', 'true', 'rules', 'project', 'rebellion', 'only', 'possible', 'fortitude', 'very', 'colonists', 'laws', 'are', 'ignoring', 'found', 'series', 'best', 'PBS', 'House', 'series', 'reason', 'struggle', 'century', 'past', 'seemed', 'very', 'real', 'educational', 'struggle', 'playing', 'out', 'moment', 'series', 'more', 'dressing', 'up', 'role', 'playing', 'past', 'very', 'essence', 'what', 'country', 'great', 'risk', 'freedom', 'essence', 'Jeff', 'Wyers', 'one', 'point', 'people', 'are', 'ungovernable', 'Americans', 'so', 'often', 'are', 'struggle', 'govern', 'nation', 'based', 'individual', 'liberty', 'heart', 'who', 'are', 'display', 'quite', 'poignantly', 'series']",N/A
829828,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B0002BO07Q,Traveler,"[43, 59]","The various individuals on the show were asked to spend 4 months (which doesn't include the weeks they spent before the show preparing, taking classes, etc.)  in a rural Maine setting under Colonial ""rules.""What Colonial House did was allow the participants to be who they were and THEN they explained what would have happened had they behaved that way in Colonial Days.  As long as the PBS producers explained what _would_ have happened, both participants and viewers alike are given a learning moment. Furthermore, dissent to the norms of the period also had its educational upside.  Many Americans think that the colonists were tolerant and accepting of other beliefs because they themselves were escaping persecution.  Not so.  And the Vorhees' behavior along with the narration helped show that.It's important to note that the original colonists did in fact commit acts that were far worse than what was shown in the series.  One colonist was executed for bestiality.  There were also a number of men who were severely whipped (the law stated they could be killed) for homosexual acts.  Obviously, it's not human behavior that changed, but our laws and social acceptance.  It is thus historically inaccurate to suggest that everyone on the show should have behaved a certain way.  More importantly, it would have been utterly inhumane and cruel to enforce such rules.  The only way Colonial House would have been historically accurate would have been if people went ahead and broke the rules and then received severe physical punishment for their actions.  Thankfully, reality TV has not yet stooped to such levels.All of this leads me to believe that the critics of this show either don't know their history or, more likely, they aren't so much concerned about historical accuracy as they are their own political agendas which deny certain historical truths.I just came back from Plymouth Plantation which was heavily involved in the production of Colonial House.  They have two of the original buildings from the show which they now incorporate into their presentation.  Of course, Plymouth Plantation is still the way it's always been.  You walk among the buildings and you can interact with a dozen or more people in period clothes and acting in the role of one of the original colonists.  Obviously, they better than the participants on Colonial House in showing people what life was ""really like.""  However, one must keep in mind that each of those people, besides being paid actors, goes home at 5 p.m. after the tourists are gone.  It's a lot easier to stay in character when you've got the 21st century waiting for you at home.Critics need to keep all of that in mind.  If you want everyone to stay in character then watch a movie of the period with paid actors.  Demanding than modern individuals go through the experience 24 hours a day (along with historically accurate punishments) with zero relief for four months would have been nothing less than sadistic.I would agree that it would have been good if the Colonial House participants could have stayed in character more.  But this is a minor problem.  My bigger complaint is that the show seemed too short given how many months they were in production.  They had four months to tape and they produced eight episodes.  It also seemed like most of the material covered the early months while not offering much insight into the last six weeks of the experience.Overall, this is a four star effort.  Sure it could have been better.  But's it's far better than what many critics are arguing.  And it _is_ educational.
