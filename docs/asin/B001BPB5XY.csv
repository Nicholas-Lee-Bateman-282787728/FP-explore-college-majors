Secondly, it comes in colorization or black and white, and both were done to perfection by Legend Films. Lastly, here is a DVD you can share with your children so you can enjoy the fun together. For these reasons I must give this one 5 stars!!",5,A great one for the kids to watch!,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,347,"['DVD', 'number', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'First', 'best', 'Spanky', 'hilarious', 'Secondly', 'colorization', 'black', 'white', 'were', 'done', 'perfection', 'Legend', 'Films', 'Lastly', 'here', 'DVD', 'can', 'share', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'together', 'reasons', 'must', 'give', 'one', '5', 'stars']",The Little Rascals in The Best of Spanky - All of the Shorts are Now In COLOR!

I remember watching these when I was a kid, and I still love them and not just as a walk down memory lane. They are great family views because everyone of all ages can enjoy them. It's sort of like Loony Tunes that way. That while it may have been written with kids in mind as the main audience, adults can certainly enjoy them too. It is a bit slapsticky at times, but the kids ""one-liners"" will never fail to put a smile on your face. I just wonder what they would have had to say if you told them at the time that people would still be watching them nearly a century later.",5,Still love em,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,658,"['Even', '80-90', 'years', 'old', 'are', 'timeless', 'classics', 'never', 'lose', 'luster', 'remember', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'still', 'love', 'not', 'just', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'are', 'great', 'family', 'views', 'everyone', 'ages', 'can', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'Loony', 'Tunes', 'way', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'kids', 'mind', 'main', 'audience', 'adults', 'can', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'too', 'bit', 'slapsticky', 'times', 'kids', 'one-liners', 'will', 'never', 'fail', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'just', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'say', 'told', 'time', 'people', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'watching', 'nearly', 'century', 'later']",The Little Rascals in The Best of Spanky - All of the Shorts are Now In COLOR!

The good thing about this DVD is that you can also view each film in its original black and white format.  I grew up watching the Rascals and Our Gang films when they regularly ran them on our local TV station during the 1960s, and I have to say these entertaining films still make me laugh.

1172972,AYPJ6NY77MTYP,B001BPB5XY,Teresa Anson,"[2, 3]","Separating the wheat from the chaff in a media collection is one of the most grating and thankless aspects of enjoying these audio-visual treats.  Take music CDs for instance, typically there are only a few good songs buried amongst a whole lot of chaff on a single album, leaving you to fumble through the wanted background noise.  So to it can be with large television or shorts collections--even the best of shows was laden with duds if it ran for long enough.  Fortunately, this is not a problem with the Little Rascals, because Legend Films has selected the very best antics of everyone's favorite character, Spanky, and consolidated them on this single DVD for easy enjoyment.  Oh, and did I neglect to mention that they have all been imbued with bright, fabulous color?  Truly a must-own for any Little Rascals fan.",5,Certifiably Spanky!,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,822,"['Separating', 'wheat', 'chaff', 'media', 'collection', 'one', 'most', 'grating', 'thankless', 'aspects', 'enjoying', 'audio-visual', 'treats', 'Take', 'music', 'CDs', 'instance', 'typically', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'good', 'songs', 'buried', 'whole', 'lot', 'chaff', 'single', 'album', 'leaving', 'fumble', 'wanted', 'background', 'noise', 'So', 'can', 'be', 'large', 'television', 'shorts', 'collections', 'even', 'best', 'shows', 'was', 'laden', 'duds', 'ran', 'long', 'enough', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'problem', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Legend', 'Films', 'selected', 'very', 'best', 'antics', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'character', 'Spanky', 'consolidated', 'single', 'DVD', 'easy', 'enjoyment', 'Oh', 'did', 'neglect', 'mention', 'have', 'been', 'imbued', 'bright', 'fabulous', 'color', 'Truly', 'must-own', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'fan']",The Little Rascals in The Best of Spanky - All of the Shorts are Now In COLOR!
