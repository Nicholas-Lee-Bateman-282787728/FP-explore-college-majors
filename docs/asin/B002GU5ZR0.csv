1268302,A1IFCQ7CC2TMFC,B002GU5ZR0,gunngirl,"[61, 64]","Incredibly depressing  and uplifting at the same time. Don't even bother to try to keep from crying. Not only does it show how many fans he had, but just how much he touched the lives of so many people on a personal level, people he never met and knew existed. What I like about it is these are just regular people, just like me and  you and we all have one common bond in Michael Jackson and that we were fans and loved and cared about him.I can't even stand to see the word ""Farewell"" in relation to him. But if you are still very emotional over his passing I think this will give you that ""You Are Not Alone"" feeling and it will make you feel good to be among people who feel the same way. I have been a fan since ""Off the Wall"" since I wasn't around for J5, but I became a fan after that fact. My fandom for him only got bigger. I'm grateful I lived in an era to see him and be alive in this world with him, and to witness a true LEGEND. I will never, never, ever forget him. I miss him so much. We fans will keep his spirit alive for many years.",5,A Legend never dies,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,1050,"['Incredibly', 'depressing', 'uplifting', 'same', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'try', 'keep', 'crying', 'Not', 'only', 'show', 'how', 'many', 'fans', 'had', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'touched', 'lives', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'personal', 'level', 'people', 'never', 'met', 'knew', 'existed', 'What', 'like', 'are', 'just', 'regular', 'people', 'just', 'have', 'one', 'common', 'bond', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'were', 'fans', 'loved', 'cared', 'him.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'see', 'word', 'Farewell', 'relation', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'emotional', 'passing', 'think', 'will', 'give', 'Are', 'Not', 'Alone', 'feeling', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Wall', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'J5', 'became', 'fan', 'fact', 'fandom', 'only', 'got', 'bigger', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'lived', 'era', 'see', 'be', 'alive', 'world', 'witness', 'true', 'LEGEND', 'will', 'never', 'never', 'ever', 'forget', 'miss', 'so', 'much', 'fans', 'will', 'keep', 'spirit', 'alive', 'many', 'years']",Michael Jackson: A Farewell to the King of Pop
1268303,A2T0I0R5FWHXJQ,B002GU5ZR0,K. Hayes,"[34, 36]","This is a warning because as a die hard fan I would want someone to share their input, if it were sincere! This is not a product worth puchasing because for what seemed like an hour, they filmed the same six to eight people! The entire footage is first asking what does Michael mean to you and then where were you when you found out he died! One guy even has the nerve to say that he's not surprised Michael died the way he did because alot of Hollywood people mix drugs and stuff -so he's not surprised! Ok- was he a fan or just a random participant of the day! I wonder how he feels now that it has been declared that Michael was murdered at the hands of another! Not saying Michael was a saint but give me a break- you are at the man's memorial service! Ugh!And no disrespect intended- but I agree with one of the other amazon comments about the people they interviewed in this film. There was not a diverse group represented and the ones shown seemed to be those who were... I'm not sure how to put it but it was not from all walks if life! They also show alot of the street hustlers who were there to make a profit off the day! Selling 8 MJ buttons for 19.99! Come on!But honestly- as a fan this is not something I would purchase to add to my collection in remembering a man who means so much to me. From one fan to another- save your money and buy something that will bless you for years to come! purchasing stuff like the DVDs he produced of his short films, looking at past interviews and anything that gives his words is the best get- besides hissongs of course! Don't become sensitive during this time and let those who throw anything together become bait for MJ fans! Listen to the comments- although it seems as if some enjoyed this footage! If you really want to see this- I will mail you my copy!

It is about Michael's World and seeing the World through Michael's eyes.  Michael's World was a World of Peace, Beauty, Love and Harmony.  This book shows Michael as a True Humanitarian who truly cared about Planet Earth, the Animals and the Children.  It mentions Michael's friends: Elizabeth Taylor, Brooke Shields, Madonna, Diana Ross, etc.  The World says goodbye to Michael in different languages of the World in this book.  You will remember MICHAEL FOREVER in the book: ""Michael In Foreverland.""  There is no other book like this out on the market.  It is very unique and is a work of Art as Michael was himself.
