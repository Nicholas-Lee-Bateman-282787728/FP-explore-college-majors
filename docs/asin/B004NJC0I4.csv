This is WWII from the Soviet perspective. The film work was all Soviet. Burt Lancaster does a fantastic job with the narration. You will pick up a lot of wartime Soviet culture, including music. I met dozens of WWII veterans of the war in the USSR. I listened to their stories and I viewed the story as Soviet citizens know it from their patriotic propaganda films. Everyone who lived during the war has stories. The nation intended that every citizen of the nation of 380 million (1980s) know the story... because it explains how they survived and their hopes for the future. Distortions and inaccurate propaganda? VERY LITTLE. Way less distortion than exists amongst American citizens. The war would have been lost had it not been for the USSR. Many other countries were instrumental in defeating the Nazis... including the USA. The war might have been lost without the US. The important thing is to understand the whole picture. American losses were low compared to the rest of the world. No nation suffered more loss than the USSR. The series is solid. None of it will cause you to fast forward. Every moment is important. The film is good quality. I ordered the dvd, but I have not seen it yet. I will report back on tech quality of the disk. 02/19/13 UPDATE: I have just viewed the first disk and the Rod McKuen interview. Disk One looks ""good enough"" to be a treasure in my hands. I shall be sharing it. It would be great if it could be restored. The color footage of Burt Lancaster and modern USSR from 1977 is faded. However the message is right there. I am reminded how good the project is. The Soviet footage varies in quality. The problems are a result of aged film. I am guessing that original source film is better preserved. It is important. I would like to see a major project to save the film records of these times... from all sources. The McKuen material is excellent. I have to confess that I forgot about him. It's probably because I was so focused on learning about the USSR in those days. I loved Jacques Brel... and that is what McKuen reminds me of. He is great. I shall report back with a report of a full viewing... much later.",5,What happens when RWNJs have their own army,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,2276,"['viewed', 'entire', 'series', '1980s', 'same', 'time', 'personally', 'worked', 'end', 'cold', 'war', 'US', 'USSR', 'WWII', 'Soviet', 'perspective', 'film', 'work', 'was', 'Soviet', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'fantastic', 'job', 'narration', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'lot', 'wartime', 'Soviet', 'culture', 'including', 'music', 'met', 'dozens', 'WWII', 'veterans', 'war', 'USSR', 'listened', 'stories', 'viewed', 'story', 'Soviet', 'citizens', 'know', 'patriotic', 'propaganda', 'films', 'Everyone', 'who', 'lived', 'war', 'stories', 'nation', 'intended', 'citizen', 'nation', '380', 'million', '1980s', 'know', 'story', 'how', 'survived', 'hopes', 'future', 'Distortions', 'inaccurate', 'propaganda', 'VERY', 'LITTLE', 'Way', 'less', 'distortion', 'amongst', 'American', 'citizens', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'USSR', 'Many', 'other', 'countries', 'were', 'instrumental', 'defeating', 'Nazis', 'including', 'USA', 'war', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'US', 'important', 'thing', 'understand', 'whole', 'picture', 'American', 'losses', 'were', 'low', 'compared', 'rest', 'world', 'nation', 'suffered', 'more', 'loss', 'USSR', 'series', 'solid', 'None', 'will', 'cause', 'fast', 'forward', 'moment', 'important', 'film', 'good', 'quality', 'ordered', 'dvd', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'will', 'report', 'back', 'tech', 'quality', 'disk', '02/19/13', 'UPDATE', 'have', 'just', 'viewed', 'first', 'disk', 'Rod', 'McKuen', 'interview', 'Disk', 'One', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'treasure', 'hands', 'shall', 'be', 'sharing', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'could', 'be', 'restored', 'color', 'footage', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'modern', 'USSR', '1977', 'faded', 'However', 'message', 'right', 'there', 'am', 'reminded', 'how', 'good', 'project', 'Soviet', 'footage', 'varies', 'quality', 'problems', 'are', 'result', 'aged', 'film', 'am', 'guessing', 'original', 'source', 'film', 'better', 'preserved', 'important', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'major', 'project', 'save', 'film', 'records', 'times', 'sources', 'McKuen', 'material', 'excellent', 'have', 'confess', 'forgot', 'probably', 'was', 'so', 'focused', 'learning', 'USSR', 'days', 'loved', 'Jacques', 'Brel', 'what', 'McKuen', 'great', 'shall', 'report', 'back', 'report', 'full', 'viewing', 'much', 'later']",N/A

""&#34;callous socio-path&...","[7, 7]","Quite an old series made with the co-operation of the Kremlin and the Red Army heirachy to correct the impression, given by the successful 'World at War' series broadcast in the 70's, that victory over Germany was pretty much an Anglo-American effort ----- with a little help from the Russians.Sadly the series was pulled from Western airwaves when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and thus made a serious challenge to East West relations. Because the series was 'pulled' a good few of the episodes never went to air and most 'Westerners' remain ignorant of the story they tell.A great deal of truly 'previously unseen combat footage' (at least it was at the time this series was made in the late 70's) is shown and it is quite interesting. I cannot remember ever seeing the 'Fascist' sniper falling out of his hiding place in a tall tree, bouncing from branch to branch on his way to the ground after being spotted and shot by a Soviet (probably Russian)adversary, before watching this series. Nor can I remember seeing close-up footage of female medics recovering the wounded from a still very active frontline ---- dragging them to safety on a ground sheet --- while trying to avoid being shot or otherwise wounded themselves, in any other documentary. According to John Erikson, a leading authority on the Russian Front, the casualties among such medics/nurses were second only to casualties among the fighting infantry itself.All in all a very worthwhile series for anybody interested in the Russian Front while the extensive 'incidental' footage gives a good idea of civilian life in the Soviet Union during the period of The Great Patriotic War.",4,The Unknown War WW2 and the Epic Battles on The Russian Front.,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,1656,"['old', 'series', 'made', 'co-operation', 'Kremlin', 'Red', 'Army', 'heirachy', 'correct', 'impression', 'given', 'successful', ""'World"", 'War', 'series', 'broadcast', '70', 'victory', 'Germany', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'Anglo-American', 'effort', 'little', 'help', 'Russians.Sadly', 'series', 'was', 'pulled', 'Western', 'airwaves', 'when', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'invaded', 'Afghanistan', 'thus', 'made', 'serious', 'challenge', 'East', 'West', 'relations', 'series', 'was', ""'pulled"", 'good', 'few', 'episodes', 'never', 'went', 'air', 'most', ""'Westerners"", 'remain', 'ignorant', 'story', 'tell.A', 'great', 'deal', 'truly', ""'previously"", 'unseen', 'combat', 'footage', 'least', 'was', 'time', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'late', '70', 'shown', 'quite', 'interesting', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'ever', 'seeing', ""'Fascist"", 'sniper', 'falling', 'hiding', 'place', 'tall', 'tree', 'bouncing', 'branch', 'branch', 'way', 'ground', 'being', 'spotted', 'shot', 'Soviet', 'probably', 'Russian', 'adversary', 'watching', 'series', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'close-up', 'footage', 'female', 'medics', 'recovering', 'wounded', 'still', 'very', 'active', 'frontline', 'dragging', 'safety', 'ground', 'sheet', 'trying', 'avoid', 'being', 'shot', 'otherwise', 'wounded', 'other', 'documentary', 'According', 'John', 'Erikson', 'leading', 'authority', 'Russian', 'Front', 'casualties', 'such', 'medics/nurses', 'were', 'second', 'only', 'casualties', 'fighting', 'infantry', 'itself.All', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'series', 'anybody', 'interested', 'Russian', 'Front', 'extensive', ""'incidental"", 'footage', 'good', 'idea', 'civilian', 'life', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'period', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War']",N/A

1421052,A1V6KHGDQNKBHV,B004NJC0I4,Lacrimatorium,"[3, 3]","Having just finished watching this epic telling of what the Russians call the Great Patriotic War I was struck by several things. In the interest of letting others make an informed decision about this set I've decided to jot a few things down as Pros and Cons.First the Pros... The number one reason to get this is for footage not found anywhere else, and lots of it. This covers aspects of World War 2 not even covered in other documentaries that feature the Eastern Front. A small sampling: The Russian attack on Manchuria/Manchuoko (not the small last minute attack western documentaries hint at), Yugoslavia (where over a million people died and yet this material isn't covered anywhere else), Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia (is there another documentary that covers the Czech uprising AFTER the fall of Berlin?), Hungary and the battle for Budapest, the Caucasus Mountain war, the Baltic states, Byelorussia (truly heart-breaking), Romania, and much more about Poland, Ukraine, the big Russian battles and sieges. This material itself would be worth 5 stars were it not for some of the Cons.Another Pro: It is helpful in understanding a basic Russian perspective of the war (even as the propaganda has seeped into that viewpoint as our own has ours). It becomes clear that from a Russian perspective that the West promised help, it gave a bit, opened up little skirmishes in North Africa and Italy, dithered a lot and didn't really enter the war until June of 1944, when essentially the Russians had it largely sewn up on the Eastern Front. I'm not saying that that is what happened, but I believe I'm correct in stating that it's the Russian point of view even today. But I'm grateful to be able to crawl into that perspective.Now the Cons... and there are quite a few. First and foremost, Burt Lancaster and Rod McKuen not withstanding, this was entirely an act of Soviet Propaganda, most of which could have been made in the 50s. Yet it does have the Detente flavor to it. The series was shelved for a while after the Soviet Afghanistan invasion. Nevertheless even though made in the late 70s not a word contradicts the essentially Stalinist interpretation, and not a word implicates Stalin in anything. Quite simply there were no Soviet mistakes. And we know far too much to swallow anything like that today. (To be fair, the Left in America hadn't really digested, or wanted to digest, Solzhenitsyn, the dissidents, or the evidence quite yet.)Fortunately Willard Sunderland's two part analysis (about an hour long) largely helps to correct that impression and I would add that as another Pro. Without that this would be an act of largely defused propaganda. And that's another reason why the propaganda isn't quite so bad, it's mostly been so unmasked and there are few old school leftists around anymore (at least in the West).Other Cons... Sentimentality. There is a tendency sometimes to edit in such a way as to hammer a sort of Germans are Animals while Russians are Innocent Victims. And granted millions of innocent Russians did die, but who was sending all of these folks to the Gulags too? Who was starving Ukrainians? Who was purging the military before the war? Who was executing Polish officers at Katyn? Was it Stalin alone? For a much more balanced view check out Russia's War: Blood Upon the Snow made in the late 90s before Putin revived Russian Nationalism.And, while there are other nit-picky Cons to observe, the last one I will mention is the music of Rod McKuen. He adds to the sentimentality in truly terrible ways. And at least five times he sings a cheap sentimental ditty over a montage near the end of an episode. Fortunately there are many episodes.But even with those caveats the Pros win out. There are moments in the visual record that take the breath away. In a shorter and lesser documentary I would've knocked it down to two or three stars. But this is quite an epic. My feeling is that if you can take the Fifties Era pro-Americanism of Victory At Sea then you can surely find much to savor here.

It fails to mention that the russians had conquered part of eastern europe with hitler before he turned on them, it makes out the soviet union to be like any other country of it's day , when in fact it was a place of mass suffering and death due to the maniacal stalin's policies.  If says that the main targets were communist officials , when in reality the jews were the first target. It fails to mentian that stalin was to blame for the disaster and that the early part of the war was one of the worst military disasters in history. It's just awful , the rest of the show rightly shows how the soviet people won the war against a even more evil system than communism and that's scary, but the outright propaganda is missing after the first episode mostly. ANd then you can get alot of good info on the war. BUt this show does have another flaw , it depicts all the germans as defeated from the start. NOw historians can show that this wasn't the case and that the germans could have won in Russia but mistakes were made. Which only makes the fact that russia won the war more impressive !! Anyways this flawed effort which takes the soviet side completely seems like it was made in the forties in a way. But it's still very good in spite of that fact .",3,interesting but slanted production.,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,2130,"['was', 'made', 'soviet', 'union', 'american', 'producers', 'police', 'states', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'accurate', 'picture', 'what', 'war', 'was', 'so', 'slanted', 'spite', 'many', 'epidodes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'good', 'informative', 'slant', ""n't"", 'matter', 'ata', 'll', 'siege', 'leningrad', 'very', 'point', 'accurate', 'move', 'east', 'factories', 'well', 'told', 'unbiased', '*but', 'even', 'episode', 'mention', 'help', 'allies', 'russians', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'deep', 'trouble', 'cnversely', 'russians', 'war', 'allies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'deep', 'trouble', 'too', '.the', 'allies', 'sent', 'numerous', 'supplies', 'particularily', 'trucks', 'help', 'win', 'allowed', 'focus', 'building', 'wars', 'best', 'tank', 't', '34', 'THe', 'first', 'episode', 'pure', 'crap', 'so', 'bad', 'rest', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'detached', 'mention', 'russians', 'had', 'conquered', 'part', 'eastern', 'europe', 'hitler', 'turned', 'out', 'soviet', 'union', 'be', 'other', 'country', 'day', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'place', 'mass', 'suffering', 'death', 'due', 'maniacal', 'stalin', 'policies', 'main', 'targets', 'were', 'communist', 'officials', 'when', 'reality', 'jews', 'were', 'first', 'target', 'mentian', 'stalin', 'was', 'blame', 'disaster', 'early', 'part', 'war', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'military', 'disasters', 'history', 'just', 'awful', 'rest', 'show', 'rightly', 'how', 'soviet', 'people', 'won', 'war', 'even', 'more', 'evil', 'system', 'communism', 'scary', 'outright', 'propaganda', 'missing', 'first', 'episode', 'mostly', 'then', 'can', 'get', 'alot', 'good', 'info', 'war', 'show', 'have', 'flaw', 'germans', 'defeated', 'start', 'can', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'germans', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'Russia', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', 'Which', 'only', 'fact', 'russia', 'won', 'war', 'more', 'impressive', 'flawed', 'effort', 'soviet', 'side', 'completely', 'was', 'made', 'forties', 'way', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'spite', 'fact']",N/A

MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THIS INTERVIEW."" prior reviewCurrent reviews mention that Stalin isn't really present in this film although he was definitely a factor in the War on the Eastern Front.  The movie also shows the Soviet side of the war, including the current, at that time, Soviet (USSR) viewpoint.  I would recommend this movie if for no other reason it does give the viewer a good idea of just how big was the War in Russia.  The USA had approximately 80 Army and 5 Marine Divisions total in the Second World War.  The Germans invaded Russia with, including their allies, over 300 Divisions and 3 Million men (the 5 million in the film is one of the Russian exaggerations I found throughout the film - but not a major one).  They destroyed over 300 Soviet divisions in 1941.  The Allies effort in the West was equal to just one Front in Russia.  Russia's effort, losses, and struggle in WWII is not understood in the West.  This film, maudlin at times, does show the magnitude of the effort by the USSR.Disc 2 and 3 are out of order.  3 should be run before 2.  (mentioned in a previous review - thanks)This film consists of:1.  A lot of film of Soviet war memorials, a lot of sad Soviet music as the Russian losses are presented, and patriotic music during the Soviet advances as Burt Lancaster drones on.2.  Film made by Soviet combat cameramen which can be exceptionally good3.  Film of ""rehearsed"" battle actions done for the cameraman (not negative - they weren't the only ones doing this and you can't shoot footage from certain angles because you would be dead).  Think about where the cameraman is when shooting the film - if in front of the attacking Soviets it is probably being filmed for the camera and is not combat footage.  A good example is the German film from the Bulge of German infantry and a Panzerjager self-propelled gun moving among a knocked out US Column.  In some cases the Germans are moving East!  The same German troops are shown going West, North, and East - all done for the on site German cameraman.  (see the book BATTLE OF THE BULGE - THEN AND NOW for details on this film which shows up in about every History Channel movie on the Battle of the Bulge.)4.  Film from the Soviet movie ""Liberation"" which is a 12 hour Soviet film on the Great Patriotic War, starting at Kursk in July, 1943 and running through the end of the war in Berlin.  Most of this footage is in the Kursk portion of The Unknown War.  The Soviets did not have T34/85 at Kursk but use them in the film.  The German armor is IS-2 tanks with modified turrets for Panthers and T54/55 with fake turrets and hull armor for Tiger I.  The later are better than the Tiger mock-ups in KELLY's Heroes and SPR.I found the parts on the Soviet partisan warfare to be some of the best footage.  WAR OF THE CENTURY by BBC video covers the same subject and comparison of the two films is very enlightening.  Also good was the footage from the assault on Berlin.This film reminds me of VICTORY AT SEA for its slant and bad editing.Left out.1.  any Soviet atrocities2.  the counter attack by Manstein after Stalingrad that established the Kursk bulge3.  the uprising in Warsaw by the Polish Home Army supported by the Polish Government in exile in England4.  why Soviet military losses other than from German atrocities were so high, especially in 19415.  the Soviet treatment of released Soviet prisoners of war, captured German prisoners, and exactly what it means that the Soviets established a ""government friendly to the Soviet Union"".Worth the money and time, but WAR OF THE CENTURY is a more balanced account.",3,"The Unknown War - Russia in Combat on the Eastern Front, almost",1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,4030,"['War', 'Century', 'When', 'Hitler', 'Fought', 'Stalin', 'Disc', '1~', 'starts', 'massive', '5', 'MILLION', 'strong', 'German', 'invasion', 'Russia', '1,800', 'mile', 'front', '**', 'BONUS**', 'interview', 'Rod', 'McKUEN', '~', 'who', 'wrote', 'screen', 'play', 'wrote', 'MUSIC~', 'interview', 'EXCELLENT', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'cold', 'war', 'were', 'suspicious', 'one', 'connected', 'series', 'were', 'allow', 'unlimited', 'use', 'film', 'Kremlin', 'MAKE', 'SURE', 'YOU', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'INTERVIEW', 'prior', 'reviewCurrent', 'reviews', 'mention', 'Stalin', ""n't"", 'really', 'present', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'factor', 'War', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'movie', 'also', 'Soviet', 'side', 'war', 'including', 'current', 'time', 'Soviet', 'USSR', 'viewpoint', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'other', 'reason', 'give', 'viewer', 'good', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'big', 'was', 'War', 'Russia', 'USA', 'had', 'approximately', '80', 'Army', '5', 'Marine', 'Divisions', 'total', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Germans', 'invaded', 'Russia', 'including', 'allies', '300', 'Divisions', '3', 'Million', 'men', '5', 'million', 'film', 'one', 'Russian', 'exaggerations', 'found', 'film', 'not', 'major', 'one', 'destroyed', '300', 'Soviet', 'divisions', '1941', 'Allies', 'effort', 'West', 'was', 'equal', 'just', 'one', 'Front', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'effort', 'losses', 'struggle', 'WWII', 'not', 'understood', 'West', 'film', 'maudlin', 'times', 'show', 'magnitude', 'effort', 'USSR.Disc', '2', '3', 'are', 'order', '3', 'should', 'be', 'run', 'before', '2', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'review', 'thanks', 'film', 'of:1', 'lot', 'film', 'Soviet', 'war', 'memorials', 'lot', 'sad', 'Soviet', 'music', 'Russian', 'losses', 'are', 'presented', 'patriotic', 'music', 'Soviet', 'advances', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'on.2', 'Film', 'made', 'Soviet', 'combat', 'cameramen', 'can', 'be', 'exceptionally', 'good3', 'Film', 'rehearsed', 'battle', 'actions', 'done', 'cameraman', 'not', 'negative', 'were', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'doing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'footage', 'certain', 'angles', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'Think', 'where', 'cameraman', 'when', 'shooting', 'film', 'front', 'attacking', 'Soviets', 'probably', 'being', 'filmed', 'camera', 'not', 'combat', 'footage', 'good', 'example', 'German', 'film', 'Bulge', 'German', 'infantry', 'Panzerjager', 'self-propelled', 'gun', 'moving', 'knocked', 'out', 'US', 'Column', 'cases', 'Germans', 'are', 'moving', 'East', 'same', 'German', 'troops', 'are', 'shown', 'going', 'West', 'North', 'East', 'done', 'site', 'German', 'cameraman', 'see', 'book', 'BATTLE', 'THE', 'BULGE', 'THEN', 'NOW', 'details', 'film', 'up', 'about', 'History', 'Channel', 'movie', 'Battle', 'Bulge.', '4', 'Film', 'Soviet', 'movie', 'Liberation', '12', 'hour', 'Soviet', 'film', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', 'starting', 'Kursk', 'July', '1943', 'running', 'end', 'war', 'Berlin', 'Most', 'footage', 'Kursk', 'portion', 'Unknown', 'War', 'Soviets', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'T34/85', 'Kursk', 'use', 'film', 'German', 'armor', 'IS-2', 'tanks', 'modified', 'turrets', 'Panthers', 'T54/55', 'fake', 'turrets', 'hull', 'armor', 'Tiger', 'later', 'are', 'better', 'Tiger', 'mock-ups', 'KELLY', 'Heroes', 'SPR.I', 'found', 'parts', 'Soviet', 'partisan', 'warfare', 'be', 'best', 'footage', 'WAR', 'THE', 'CENTURY', 'BBC', 'video', 'same', 'subject', 'comparison', 'two', 'films', 'very', 'enlightening', 'Also', 'good', 'was', 'footage', 'assault', 'Berlin.This', 'film', 'VICTORY', 'AT', 'SEA', 'slant', 'bad', 'editing.Left', 'out.1', 'Soviet', 'atrocities2', 'counter', 'attack', 'Manstein', 'Stalingrad', 'established', 'Kursk', 'bulge3', 'uprising', 'Warsaw', 'Polish', 'Home', 'Army', 'supported', 'Polish', 'Government', 'exile', 'England4', 'why', 'Soviet', 'military', 'losses', 'other', 'German', 'atrocities', 'were', 'so', 'high', 'especially', '19415.', 'Soviet', 'treatment', 'released', 'Soviet', 'prisoners', 'war', 'captured', 'German', 'prisoners', 'exactly', 'what', 'Soviets', 'established', 'government', 'friendly', 'Soviet', 'Union', '.Worth', 'money', 'time', 'WAR', 'THE', 'CENTURY', 'more', 'balanced', 'account']",N/A

It was produced by Western companies with help from the Soviet government. Up until the release of this series, the majority of documentaries glossed over the Russian Front and the sacrifice of the Soviets in defeating the Nazis. This series has a lot of unusual footage, but it lacks the historical authenticity of a series like The World At War. Often film clips are shown that are not relevant to the narration. This is likely a reflection of the lack of expertise of the production staff than any attempt at misleading the viewer. However, the narration does ignore several glaring instances of Soviet aggression. They ignore the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, and they don't mention the closeness of the Soviet and Nazi military after World War 1. Many German tank commanders got their experience and training in Soviet Russia, as the Treaty of Versaille limited Germany by forbidding an armored force. They also ignore the military purges Stalin carried out, and they characterize the Holodimor -the Ukrainian Famine- not as a Soviet run holocaust, rather they present it as a &#34;tragedy&#34;, not political mass murder. Also the show ignores the fact that the Soviets took all of Spain's gold in exchange for supporting the Republican forces in the Civil War. This isn't mentioned, rather it is couched as the benevolent and wise Stalin fighting fascism. So as an historical series it is limited, but so are most western documentaries. If one watches this series you will get a better understanding of the true cost in human terms of the Great Patriotic War. However, the base political machinations of the great powers are not explored, and this is a shame, as ethnic and political divisions from this era are at the forefront of today's international news.",5,A Fascinating and Biased Overview of The Eastern Front in World War 2,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1882,"['20', 'part', 'series', 'narrated', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'war', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'Russian', 'eyes', 'was', 'produced', 'Western', 'companies', 'help', 'Soviet', 'government', 'release', 'series', 'majority', 'documentaries', 'glossed', 'Russian', 'Front', 'sacrifice', 'Soviets', 'defeating', 'Nazis', 'series', 'lot', 'unusual', 'footage', 'historical', 'authenticity', 'series', 'World', 'War', 'Often', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'not', 'relevant', 'narration', 'likely', 'reflection', 'lack', 'expertise', 'production', 'staff', 'attempt', 'misleading', 'viewer', 'However', 'narration', 'ignore', 'several', 'glaring', 'instances', 'Soviet', 'aggression', 'ignore', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'Poland', '1939', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'closeness', 'Soviet', 'Nazi', 'military', 'World', 'War', '1', 'Many', 'German', 'tank', 'commanders', 'got', 'experience', 'training', 'Soviet', 'Russia', 'Treaty', 'Versaille', 'limited', 'Germany', 'forbidding', 'armored', 'force', 'also', 'ignore', 'military', 'purges', 'Stalin', 'carried', 'out', 'characterize', 'Holodimor', '-the', 'Ukrainian', 'Famine-', 'not', 'Soviet', 'run', 'holocaust', 'rather', 'present', '34', 'tragedy', '34', 'not', 'political', 'mass', 'murder', 'Also', 'show', 'fact', 'Soviets', 'took', 'Spain', 'gold', 'exchange', 'supporting', 'Republican', 'forces', 'Civil', 'War', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'rather', 'couched', 'benevolent', 'wise', 'Stalin', 'fighting', 'fascism', 'So', 'historical', 'series', 'limited', 'so', 'are', 'most', 'western', 'documentaries', 'one', 'series', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'true', 'cost', 'human', 'terms', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', 'However', 'base', 'political', 'machinations', 'great', 'powers', 'are', 'not', 'explored', 'shame', 'ethnic', 'political', 'divisions', 'era', 'are', 'forefront', 'today', 'international', 'news']",N/A
1421058,A1OHGG0JUMASAY,B004NJC0I4,Reader,"[2, 3]","I have noticed that many have criticized this documentaries as if ""it very much slanted against the Germans and their allies""... First of all, let's say that this is not about Germans or Russians, or any other nationality in particular. There were people among Germans, who disagreed with Hitler's politics, as well as hundreds of thousands of Russians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Georgians, Jews, Armenians and many other nationalities were sent by Stalin prior, during and after WWII to Siberian concentration camps. Second of all, Nazis had no business invading Soviet Union. If a thief comes to my home and I kick him out with a gun point while defending my family and my property, should I emphasize on public that I might be biased against that thief and should I try to persuade the public to support that thief's point of view equally with mine? This is ludicrous! So don't expect people, who were defending their motherland, to do so in this documentaries. Stalin was hiding in Kremlin while many nationalities of all ages (children, teenagers, men and women, elderly) were fighting, starving to death and sacrificing their lives in order to free their homes from those maniacal Nazi thieves. So, let us at least honor the memory of those human beings, who sacrificed their lives and stopped the brown plague from taking over the world.

It was called that way for until then not much was known about that conflict throughout the West. It was also known that until then a generation had been born which did not know the horrors of the Nazis or Stalin.That Documentary was with Lancaster being Filmed for the opening of each episode in many places in the USSR and it was edited and produced in London. The music was written and sung by McKuen, while as for the great Russian Patriotic song of The Sacred War it was its theme.In this series scenes of carnage and bravery was well documented, as well as the overwhelming cruelty of the Nazis and what they did to those conquered who were to die. That was especially when dealing with those horrible Concentration Camps such as Auschwitz and the Death Trains.When dealing with other places that Nazis controlled such as so many Factories in which Slaves were worked to death they were also presented. That was especially when dealing with a Factory in present day Gdansk that processed dead human bodies from the Camps into Soap, with a frightening image of a victim with his dead eyes staring to space being everlasting. The showing of the Gallows built by the Nazis in Town and village squares in Nazi held territory in the USSR showed the dead charred from flame throwers. These images were to also show how infants were killed throughout those lands of Russia and Belarus as well as Ukrayina which were Nazi occupied.This all made this Documentary a true service for those who died so that they would never be forgotten. I recommend the Series to anyone who wants to learn about the Great Patriotic War. No matter how painful the images are it is important for the terror of the Second World War and the Bravery of the people of the USSR against the Nazis to be reminded to each generation. The need of reminding many about the needs of generations always being reminded of the Nazis and their evil is none negotiable Ignore this fact one allows the same savagery and inhumanity of the Nazis to be repeated.",5,An Amazing Documentary,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,2154,"['1978', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Rod', 'McKuen', 'worked', 'epic', 'documentary', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', 'was', 'be', 'called', 'UNKNOWN', 'WAR', 'was', 'called', 'way', 'then', 'not', 'much', 'was', 'known', 'conflict', 'West', 'was', 'also', 'known', 'then', 'generation', 'had', 'been', 'born', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'horrors', 'Nazis', 'Stalin.That', 'Documentary', 'was', 'Lancaster', 'being', 'Filmed', 'opening', 'episode', 'many', 'places', 'USSR', 'was', 'edited', 'produced', 'London', 'music', 'was', 'written', 'sung', 'McKuen', 'great', 'Russian', 'Patriotic', 'song', 'Sacred', 'War', 'was', 'theme.In', 'series', 'scenes', 'carnage', 'bravery', 'was', 'well', 'documented', 'as', 'well', 'overwhelming', 'cruelty', 'Nazis', 'what', 'did', 'conquered', 'who', 'were', 'die', 'was', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'horrible', 'Concentration', 'Camps', 'such', 'Auschwitz', 'Death', 'Trains.When', 'dealing', 'other', 'places', 'Nazis', 'controlled', 'such', 'so', 'many', 'Factories', 'Slaves', 'were', 'worked', 'death', 'were', 'also', 'presented', 'was', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'Factory', 'present', 'day', 'Gdansk', 'processed', 'dead', 'human', 'bodies', 'Camps', 'Soap', 'frightening', 'image', 'victim', 'dead', 'eyes', 'staring', 'space', 'being', 'everlasting', 'showing', 'Gallows', 'built', 'Nazis', 'Town', 'village', 'squares', 'Nazi', 'held', 'territory', 'USSR', 'showed', 'dead', 'charred', 'flame', 'throwers', 'images', 'were', 'also', 'show', 'how', 'infants', 'were', 'killed', 'lands', 'Russia', 'Belarus', 'as', 'well', 'Ukrayina', 'were', 'Nazi', 'made', 'Documentary', 'true', 'service', 'who', 'died', 'so', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'recommend', 'Series', 'anyone', 'who', 'learn', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', 'matter', 'how', 'painful', 'images', 'are', 'important', 'terror', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Bravery', 'people', 'USSR', 'Nazis', 'be', 'reminded', 'generation', 'need', 'reminding', 'many', 'needs', 'generations', 'always', 'being', 'reminded', 'Nazis', 'evil', 'none', 'negotiable', 'Ignore', 'fact', 'one', 'same', 'savagery', 'inhumanity', 'Nazis', 'be', 'repeated']",N/A
