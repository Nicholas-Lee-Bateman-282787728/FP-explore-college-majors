What I found weird is how they seem closeted in private. And maybe this is part of Eric's journey of growth.

But that sounds so natural that no one can complain, except the bigots and there are not very many around.The child, Scot, should be pitied through and through. The son of a father he does not know, raised by his mother as a girl, his mother dying of an overdose, or in an accident, no one seems to really know or want to know, abandoned by the second man of his mother to whom she had willed the boy along with her comfortable life insurance. The boy is trapped. But no pity please: we've run out of tissues.Luckily the stepfather being in Brazil, the boy, Scot, has to be entrusted to someone and that's the brother of that ""Brazilian"" stepfather, the brother and his boyfriend.The film is funny because of the disturbance it introduces into the daily life of these two men who have to learn how to take care of a child, of a boy: take him to school, make him socialize, introduce him to sports and the neighbors, teach him how to fight to defend himself and his reputation when he is accused of being gay (with a nice little ugly word for it) and when the men who are taking care of him are also accused of being gay (with another nice little ugly word for it).Then the film becomes interesting because the boy, Scot, little by little gets tricked and then trapped in his new life without actually denying what he is or what he feels. He learns how not to kiss everyone, especially the boys, or how not to hug everybody, especially the boys, for no reason whatsoever.Then the rest you'll have to discover. The ending is slightly mushy because the director wants it to be pink and nice, but it is so improbable that we have to suspend our disbelief so much we get vertigo. But that's all right provided you accept the idea that it is supposed to teach the bigots a lesson. But does it really?Entertaining though maybe too rosy to be true. But at times in life we need to believe a dream can be true. So enjoy the fun and relax in the entertaining cinematographic Jacuzzi.

Klinger ""weather nut""","[1, 4]","I hate to be a spoilsport after all the glowing reviews, but while I enjoyed manymoments, especially the ending sequence, I was put off somewhat by the sitcomlike mood and direction, which undercut the importance of the subject matter.  Ilearned about this film as a result of purchasing another gay themed film, ""A VerySerious Person"", starring Polly Bergen, Charles Busch, and P.J.Verhoest, whichin my view is a far better film dealing with many of the same issues.  And it isalso comedic, but it rarely descends into all-out sitcom style.  Here, a gay malecouple, one a former aggressive hockey player, and the other a lawyer (changedoccupations from the book) become temporary caretakers of the hockey player'sbrother's girlfriend's 11 year old son after she dies from a drug overdose.  Ofcourse neither of the men wanted kids, but they were not expecting a flamboyantlyeffeminate boy who loves jewelry and fancy frilly clothes and such.  And you knowthat they eventually will wind up keeping the boy, especially when the hockeyplayer, Eric's, brother is early on revealed as a playboy jerk.  About midwaythrough, the boy, Sam, well played by Noah Bernett, hoping to win over Eric, agreesto join up for junior hockey, which of course ultimately doesn't work, and leadsto everyone learning to accept everyone as is.  The use of the real Toronto MapleLeaf Venue lends some much needed reality, as too many scenes fail to deliveror go far enough to really deal with the underlying issues realistically, preferringinstead to go for broad or easy laughs or changing the subject completely.

1130575,A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP,B00118S6CY,"Robert Carnevali ""Typical, middle-aged guy""","[1, 1]","I fell in love with this movie long before the first viewing ended. The story is a bit formulaic at times, so events are predictable, but the characters are so well portrayed, and situations so unique, that it feels fresh.Eric and Sam are a happy, childless, gay couple. Eric was once a professional hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs (this is the first gay-themed film where a professional sports team allowed the use of their logo). After a serious injury, he retired as a player, settled in with Sam, and got a job as a sportscaster on TV. Eric keeps his relationship and orientation a secret, except from family and friends, and Sam humors him. One day, they find out that Sam's brother Billy gained custody of 11-year-old Scot when the Scot's mother died of an overdose. Billy had dated the mother (Julia) previously, and Julia had never updated her will. Since Billy is nowhere to be found (he's horribly irresponsible), Child Services places Scot with Sam and Eric for a short while. To complicate matters, Scot turns out to be flamboyant and effeminate. While Eric tries to keep his sexuality a secret, Scot draws attention to it, especially since he introduces Eric to people as ""This is Eric. He's watching over me. He's gay."" Keep in mind that Eric is not only a former hockey player, but a former, good, professional hockey player who was a great fighter too.Tom Cavanagh plays Eric wonderfully well. He's interesting and fun to watch, he gives Eric a great personality, has good comedic timing, and shows his chops with the dramatic scenes. It's a joy to watch Eric gradually go from ambivalence to fatherhood through the course of the film. Noah Bernett is great as Scot (with only one ""T"", since it stops there). Scot exhibits many stereotypical gay characteristics (to an extreme), his actual sexuality is wisely never explored (making the character even more interesting), he's flamboyant, honest, talkative, exuberant, inquisitive... a smorgasbord of characteristics. And Noah Bernett manages to tie it all together and make Scot seem real.The movie has a nice pace to it. There are ample comic moments with good dramatic moments mingled throughout. The characters are incredibly charismatic, and the overall tone of the movie is very enjoyable. Direction could have been a tad tighter though as some moments didn't play out to their fully potential, but was still good. Though Scot is the most visible character in the movie, the real story is in Eric. Here we have someone who simply wasn't comfortable with having the ""gay"" label attached to him. As he learned to accept Scot, he learned to accept himself. In a sense, it's a coming-out story, but executed so sublimely as to not feel that way. The movie doesn't have a ""political"" feel to it, and doesn't even really come off as a ""gay"" movie. It's just feel-good fun movie.

1130576,A14794N044AML4,B00118S6CY,"Rolando A. Perez ""RAP""","[1, 1]","It is refershing that another country makes the first gay movie with the endorsement of a professional sports team.Tom Cavanaugh plays Eric, an injured professional hockey player. Sam his lawyer and partner is played by Ben Shenkman. Scot, the orphaned young boy, played by Noah Bernett, is the son of one of Billy (Sam's brother) many girlfriends who dies of a drug overdose and leaves custody of Scot to Billy.While trying to locate Billy (who happens to be in Brazil), the court dumps custody of Scot to Sam and Eric. Eric is very closeted and masculine about his approach to being gay because he is a sports host on a local TV station. Scot, on the hand, is as effeminated as you can be, emulating the only memory of his mother. Scot disrupts Eric and Sam lives with his funny eccentricities.The morals of the story are basically that gay parents can be good parents and that you don't need to hide or pretend who you are beacuse that what is the world wants you to be, because deep down inside, everybody knows.The movie is charming, the kids from Scot's school are lovable (except for the abnoxious kid from across the street, but even with his bigotry, you learn to accept him.) The friends and relatives of Eric and Sam are all understanding and good company. And best of all I love the transformation Eric goes through when Scot comes into his life. Oh yes, Scot is delightful, good acting on all parts.",5,Nice Story,1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,1412,"['refershing', 'country', 'first', 'gay', 'movie', 'endorsement', 'professional', 'sports', 'team.Tom', 'Cavanaugh', 'plays', 'Eric', 'injured', 'professional', 'hockey', 'player', 'Sam', 'lawyer', 'partner', 'played', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'Scot', 'orphaned', 'young', 'boy', 'played', 'Noah', 'Bernett', 'son', 'one', 'Billy', 'Sam', 'brother', 'many', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'drug', 'overdose', 'custody', 'Scot', 'Billy.While', 'trying', 'locate', 'Billy', 'who', 'be', 'Brazil', 'court', 'custody', 'Scot', 'Sam', 'Eric', 'Eric', 'very', 'closeted', 'masculine', 'approach', 'being', 'gay', 'sports', 'host', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'Scot', 'hand', 'as', 'effeminated', 'can', 'be', 'emulating', 'only', 'memory', 'mother', 'Scot', 'Eric', 'Sam', 'funny', 'eccentricities.The', 'morals', 'story', 'are', 'basically', 'gay', 'parents', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hide', 'pretend', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'world', 'be', 'deep', 'inside', 'everybody', 'knows.The', 'movie', 'charming', 'kids', 'Scot', 'school', 'are', 'lovable', 'abnoxious', 'kid', 'street', 'even', 'bigotry', 'learn', 'accept', 'friends', 'relatives', 'Eric', 'Sam', 'are', 'understanding', 'good', 'company', 'best', 'love', 'transformation', 'Eric', 'when', 'Scot', 'life', 'Oh', 'yes', 'Scot', 'delightful', 'good', 'acting', 'parts']",Breakfast With Scot
