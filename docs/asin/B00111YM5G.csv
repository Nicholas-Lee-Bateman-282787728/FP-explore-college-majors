1128713,A10TRXQBELWYMF,B00111YM5G,A. Burroughs,"[1, 1]","This was a strange, strange film.  Not in a 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' or 'Army of Darkness' kind of cult-strange (which I adore in all of its campy awfulness), but just strange.  Lots of potential here, but the film was bogged down by some truly awful acting.  The lead character, Gabriel, is a decent actor, and so were the actors depicting Uriel and Raphael (very minor characters unfortunately), but the rest were just mediocre and the guy depicting Sammael was a truly awful cartoon of a villain.  The love interest is just so-so given the potential of the set of circumstances she was given to work with and the love scene is truly ... bland.  Given the R rating, they should have spiced things up.I probably should have rated this only one star, but the depictions of Purgatory and the sense of helplessness and hopelessness depicted by some of the most minor characters, many of them simply 'extras' without a single spoken line, earned it the second star.  The whorehouse bouncer was kind of funny.  The children without lines ... there was more acting in those tormented kids faces than most of the major characters.  Purgatory as depicted in this movie just seemed far more real than the purgatorio painted by Dante and numerous old testament and mythological rantings.",2,"Strange, strange film",1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,1281,"['was', 'strange', 'strange', 'film', 'Not', ""'Rocky"", 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', ""'Army"", 'Darkness', 'kind', 'cult-strange', 'adore', 'campy', 'awfulness', 'just', 'strange', 'Lots', 'potential', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'bogged', 'down', 'truly', 'awful', 'acting', 'lead', 'character', 'Gabriel', 'decent', 'actor', 'so', 'were', 'actors', 'depicting', 'Uriel', 'Raphael', 'very', 'minor', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'rest', 'were', 'just', 'mediocre', 'guy', 'depicting', 'Sammael', 'was', 'truly', 'awful', 'cartoon', 'villain', 'love', 'interest', 'just', 'so-so', 'given', 'potential', 'set', 'circumstances', 'was', 'given', 'work', 'love', 'scene', 'truly', 'bland', 'Given', 'R', 'rating', 'should', 'have', 'spiced', 'things', 'up.I', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'rated', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'depictions', 'Purgatory', 'sense', 'helplessness', 'hopelessness', 'depicted', 'most', 'minor', 'characters', 'many', 'simply', 'single', 'spoken', 'line', 'earned', 'second', 'star', 'whorehouse', 'bouncer', 'was', 'kind', 'funny', 'children', 'lines', 'was', 'more', 'acting', 'tormented', 'kids', 'most', 'major', 'characters', 'Purgatory', 'depicted', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'far', 'more', 'real', 'purgatorio', 'painted', 'Dante', 'numerous', 'old', 'testament', 'mythological', 'rantings']",Gabriel

I thought it was overly bloody, no special effects of angels with wings or flying (like the mini-series, ""The Fallen"" based on books by T.Sniegoski, which I thought was an awesome plot of fallen angels & their offspring). The scenes in ""Gabriel"" were dark (supposedly because the earth/mankind had fallen to evil and darkness). I think it could've been better done. Somehow angels with (man-made) guns doesn't quite fit right, maybe mystical swords would've been better. But supposedly when Gabriel became human he lost his powers, so I guess he had to resort to guns? But somehow he still had ""some"" powers evidenced in his ability to sense things, forcing people to tell him what he wanted to know, or healing, etc. In general the story line itself was poor: the story of an angel trying to bring light to mankind, without subcoming to the ""human"" vices. He searches for other angels who came but failed at defeating the darkness and evil angels, he tries to remind them of their mission and purpose. Personally I found that there was very little depth to the characters, it was hard to identify with anyone. Maybe some people might actually like it.

Erland,"[91, 99]","Synopsis: The Archangel Gabriel descends into the intermediate world of Purgatory on a mission to destroy a group of fallen angels who have taken control of the realm, thus preventing the human souls there from evolving upward. Six Archs (Archangels) have preceded Gabriel on this dangerous mission and all have mysteriously disappeared into the foreboding landscape. Will Gabriel be able to stand alone against the combined forces of Sammael, Amodeus, Lilith, Molloch, Ahriman and the rest? And what of the six missing Archs? What horrible fate has befallen them?Critique: The '07 film `Gabriel' has cleverly blended disparate elements from numerable popular, financially successful films and added several interesting ideas of its own into one storyline that may not be highly original but is definitely entertaining.Recipe for making `Gabriel':- Begin with the basic ingredients (storyline) from the cult classic `The Prophecy' minus the comedic elements provided by Christopher Walken,- Blend with the graphic, cinematic style of `Sin City',- Sprinkle liberally with some of the pervasive melancholy made famous in `The Crow',- Add a pinch of costuming ala `The Matrix', one creepy looking bald, vampirish bad guy reminiscent of `Blade II', an attractive brunette who bears a strong resemblance to Kate Beckinsale as she appeared in `Underworld' and a little `City of Angels' at the very end.Secret Ingredient:-For a deeper more profound flavoring check out an obscure, Indie film from '03 titled `The Despiser'. It also deals with a war in Purgatory in which the ultimate danger is that death in this realm equates to permanent extinction. Sound familiar?While there are plenty of similarities and comparisons one can make with other films `Gabriel' is still somehow unique enough to carry a distinct flavor and texture all its own that should attract a wide audience of loyal fans.

In this way, it's not Biblical faithful as some may think.As for those who believe in Purgatory, contrary to what this movie says about it, the fate of those souls have already been decided; those souls are being purged or cleaned of all the venial sins they have committed or had at the our of their death before they can enter Heaven; but their fate is not ""yet to be decided"" (as this films says).Bearing in mind that this is only a fictional story, I like some facts such as that Angels have the capability to appear as human in fleshy form, spend time with humans, live, eat with humans and as humans, etc; (such as the Angels who destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). The villain in this movie is pretty good, I even liked him better than the supposed hero in this movie.

But I only enjoy them when they are well done.The Fallen (Denzel Washington), Frailty (Bill Paxton) and even Constantine (Keanu Reeves) - even if the last wasn't faithful to the original comic it had merits of its own not to mention Tilda Swinton as the Angel Gabriel.This film just passes on in a rather monotone manner and in retrospect I wasn't entertained. It managed a dark atmosphere well enough and the costumes were decent but the story was terribly lacking and what little there was had no depth. Occasionally it looked as if it was going somewhere and it did but not in a unique or clever way. Nor did the story build on legend or dogma it just went on in a juvenile way.Fair enough the main danger in Purgatory is hopelessness and fear, helped by the fact that the Arcs (Archangel in a not so cool version) become human there - albeit with Angelic superpowers (making everything a bit confused). This we are told time and time again but telling isn't convincing in itself and the story lacks build up or credit as to how it happens.The small budget is telling and for me I didn't hate it, but felt that my time could have been a lot better spent reading a book or sleeping.In fact most Hellblazer books are superior in story and telling.",2,I recommend you read a book or go early to bed to this one,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,1307,"['enjoy', 'movies', 'Gabriel', 'excellent', 'review', 'only', 'enjoy', 'when', 'are', 'well', 'done.The', 'Fallen', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Frailty', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'even', 'Constantine', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'even', 'last', 'was', ""n't"", 'faithful', 'original', 'comic', 'had', 'merits', 'own', 'not', 'mention', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Angel', 'Gabriel.This', 'film', 'just', 'passes', 'rather', 'monotone', 'manner', 'retrospect', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertained', 'managed', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'well', 'enough', 'costumes', 'were', 'decent', 'story', 'was', 'terribly', 'lacking', 'what', 'little', 'was', 'had', 'depth', 'Occasionally', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'somewhere', 'did', 'not', 'unique', 'clever', 'way', 'did', 'story', 'build', 'legend', 'dogma', 'just', 'went', 'juvenile', 'way.Fair', 'main', 'danger', 'Purgatory', 'hopelessness', 'fear', 'helped', 'fact', 'Arcs', 'Archangel', 'not', 'so', 'cool', 'version', 'become', 'human', 'albeit', 'Angelic', 'superpowers', 'making', 'everything', 'bit', 'confused', 'are', 'told', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'telling', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'story', 'build', 'up', 'credit', 'how', 'happens.The', 'small', 'budget', 'telling', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'felt', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'spent', 'reading', 'book', 'sleeping.In', 'fact', 'most', 'Hellblazer', 'books', 'are', 'superior', 'story', 'telling']",Gabriel

Currently power has shifted to the evil side and the last hope for the good, Gabriel is sent down.  The beginning tells us only one can be sent down every ""cycle"" whatever a cycle is they don't tell us but it doesn't matter because they are all down there now (it made it seem like there was only one at a time).  Inexplicably, they have to take ""human"" form?  What?  I thought they were just souls there?  No, in this world there is a apparently a second chance of life with real physical forms/bodies in purgatory who bleed, eat, drink, party etc.  (already weak story line).  Purgatory looks suspiciously like NYC except it is raining all the time.  So yep, purgatory has electricity, crime, bugs, cars etc.  Just as an aside, you never see any wings so despite the main picture on the cover, there are no real angel battles, just gangster style shootings and poor fight scenes.  The archangels have blue eyes and the fallen angels have orangish red eyes-to make it easy to distinguish.  Spoiler alerts here on out:  So when Gabriel gets there he finds all the other archangels except Michael?  Hmm, wonder where he is . . . uh oh, there is that strange looking guy with white eyes who never gets names and says he used to follow the ways of God but now bosses the fallen angels around. . . do you think?  Yes!  Wow that was a tough to figure out . . . not.  So the entire story is Gabriel killing fallen angels (not exciting action-one fight even has the figures fight in a weird light that changes them to look like yellow cartoons figures).  The other activity is finding the other archangels, well they decided it was too tough and unfair to be sent down there to help out in purgatory so they just gave up and became whores, drunks, homeless, soup kitchen operators etc.  Of course, this is totally reasonable for the archangels . .. not!  The weak story comes down to a final battle with Michael who waits to the end to fight Gabriel just to allow the slow and weak plot to unfold.  The battle at the end is totally useless and if anyone hasn't figured out that guy is Michael they must have been living in a cave or under 7 years old, as it is obvious in this slow and poorly done movie.  I love cult classics, like Highlander that other reviewers mentioned but I hated this.  Andy Whitfield was actually OK as Gabriel but had nothing to work with.

I didn't know that that is what Purgatory was supposed to be.  God can't make up his mind?  Anyway, why were the fates of these souls undecided.  They were practicing rapists, theives, killers and prostitutes.  They were drug dealers and sellers of illegal firearms.  They shouldn't have been in Purgatory if the only criteria is that God has not decided on where they should spend eternity.  Anyway, the forces of darkness have taken over and arch angels from Heaven (or THE LIGHT as they called it. I guess because they had to be politically correct and not use words like God, Supreme Being, Creator etc.) were sent down one by one to defeat the forces of darkness and bring light back to Purgatory.  Six archangels fail and Gabriel is the last one.  When he arrives he becomes a warrior in a post-apocolytic looking city or something.  I found it troubling that the weapons of choice by angels would be knives and guns and bombs and lead pipes.  It was hard to accept this place as Purgatory.  Anyway, the movie has it's moments when Jade is rescued, then plays not much of a part any more in the picture and when Raphael is healed.  After that, the film is a series of ever increasingly boring fight scenes, including the final climactic one which seemed to take...well, it took an eternity for goodness sake.  This isn't really an unwatchable film but I would not recommend it to anyone and for sure would never consider owning it.",2,Interesting idea gone awry,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,1858,"['had', 'hopes', 'movie', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'hour', 'hopes', 'became', 'more', 'concentrated', 'watching', 'timer', 'drag', 'slowly', '114', 'minute', 'mark', 'was', 'very', 'disapointing', 'film', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'weak', 'thought', 'arch', 'angels', 'Heaven', 'could', 'not', 'fight', 'forces', 'darkness', 'Purgatory', 'place', 'where', 'souls', 'people', 'who', 'fate', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'decided', 'go', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Purgatory', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'God', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'Anyway', 'why', 'were', 'fates', 'souls', 'undecided', 'were', 'practicing', 'rapists', 'theives', 'killers', 'prostitutes', 'were', 'drug', 'dealers', 'sellers', 'illegal', 'firearms', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'Purgatory', 'only', 'criteria', 'God', 'not', 'decided', 'where', 'should', 'spend', 'eternity', 'Anyway', 'forces', 'darkness', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'arch', 'angels', 'Heaven', 'THE', 'LIGHT', 'called', 'guess', 'had', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'not', 'use', 'words', 'God', 'Supreme', 'Being', 'Creator', 'etc', 'were', 'sent', 'down', 'one', 'one', 'defeat', 'forces', 'darkness', 'bring', 'light', 'back', 'Purgatory', 'Six', 'archangels', 'fail', 'Gabriel', 'last', 'one', 'When', 'warrior', 'post-apocolytic', 'looking', 'city', 'something', 'found', 'troubling', 'weapons', 'choice', 'angels', 'would', 'be', 'knives', 'guns', 'bombs', 'lead', 'pipes', 'was', 'hard', 'accept', 'place', 'Purgatory', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'moments', 'when', 'Jade', 'rescued', 'then', 'not', 'much', 'part', 'more', 'picture', 'when', 'Raphael', 'healed', 'film', 'series', 'ever', 'increasingly', 'boring', 'fight', 'scenes', 'including', 'final', 'climactic', 'one', 'seemed', 'take', 'well', 'took', 'eternity', 'goodness', 'sake', ""n't"", 'really', 'unwatchable', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'sure', 'would', 'never', 'consider', 'owning']",Gabriel

But listening to these angels argue their position on joining one side vs. another is almost like listening to the premise on why one should work for the corporation vs. working as an independent consultant.  Other interesting premises such as a good angel that is killed by a bad angel (and vice versa) simply dies for the eternity.  These creatures have no souls to take them into a next world, or another body as it is the case with humans.  Angel fallen from the grace (like the one who no longer has wings) is basically turned into a human.  They are punished to live human life with all of its hardships but there is hope that their souls will continue to live.

It is very good, has a lot of action, gunfighting, and even some special effects that were pretty good.the story starts off with Gabriel last of the ArcAngels (their spelling, mine is ArchAngel)well, each time he taps into the ""source aka God"" for power he not only grows weaker, but alerts all the demons exactly where he is.as if that's not enough, the last 6 arcangels failed to bring about an end to the darkness and now it is totally up to gabriel to end Sammael's Reign of evil and put an end to darkness and finally release the sun.a really well done flick but if you are looking for constantine style effects you will be dissappointed. this film has quite a few talkie spots but the story is so compelling you might not notice.most of the effects are comprised of super strength, speed, some glowy Particle effects and changing eye color. (eyes seem to represent demon (reddish amber) angel (blue) and regular human eyes.)my only minor gripe with the film was the fact everyone (angels and demons) used guns for fighting and naught else. still great though.Overall: this is a good film not overloaded with effects, blood and gore etc. it is a gripping story about the final fight for purgatory and the souls of earth and the fallen angels. I'd recommend it.4 Stars.Extras Include:deleted Scenes, and 3 making of featurettes. not bad.Buy it here!Gabriel",4,Angels Packing heat!,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,1463,"['was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'film', 'expected', 'be', 'yet', 'low', 'budget', 'flop', 'surprise', 'very', 'good', 'lot', 'action', 'gunfighting', 'even', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'good.the', 'story', 'Gabriel', 'last', 'ArcAngels', 'spelling', 'mine', 'ArchAngel', 'well', 'time', 'source', 'aka', 'God', 'power', 'not', 'only', 'weaker', 'demons', 'exactly', 'where', 'is.as', 'not', 'enough', 'last', '6', 'arcangels', 'failed', 'bring', 'about', 'end', 'darkness', 'now', 'totally', 'up', 'gabriel', 'end', 'Sammael', 'Reign', 'evil', 'put', 'end', 'darkness', 'finally', 'release', 'sun.a', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'flick', 'are', 'looking', 'constantine', 'style', 'effects', 'will', 'be', 'dissappointed', 'film', 'quite', 'few', 'talkie', 'spots', 'story', 'so', 'compelling', 'might', 'not', 'notice.most', 'effects', 'are', 'comprised', 'super', 'strength', 'speed', 'glowy', 'Particle', 'effects', 'changing', 'eye', 'color', 'eyes', 'seem', 'represent', 'demon', 'reddish', 'amber', 'angel', 'blue', 'regular', 'human', 'eyes', 'only', 'minor', 'gripe', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'everyone', 'angels', 'demons', 'used', 'guns', 'fighting', 'naught', 'else', 'still', 'great', 'though.Overall', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'overloaded', 'effects', 'blood', 'gore', 'etc', 'gripping', 'story', 'final', 'fight', 'purgatory', 'souls', 'earth', 'fallen', 'angels', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'it.4', 'Stars.Extras', 'Include', 'deleted', 'Scenes', '3', 'making', 'featurettes', 'not', 'here', 'Gabriel']",Gabriel

It was straight to DVD but I thought I would give it a shot and bought it. I must say it was entertaining but I don't think that it is for everybody and I am not sure that everybody would like it as much as I did. If the story hadn't had some of the suprises it did I probably would have rated it a 1 but it was interesting enough and unpredictable enough for me to actually recommend it to some sci-fi fans and fans of other movies about archangels and that type of genre.,2,Good Solid 2 Stars,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,563,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'weird', 'was', 'shot', 'really', 'weird', 'way', 'was', 'straight', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'shot', 'bought', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'everybody', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'everybody', 'would', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'story', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'suprises', 'did', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'rated', '1', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'unpredictable', 'enough', 'actually', 'recommend', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'fans', 'other', 'movies', 'archangels', 'type', 'genre']",Gabriel
1128763,A2ZIDCYC0GWWKF,B00111YM5G,"Vladislav ""Tepes""","[0, 0]","Its a 2007 Australian  film set in purgatory.and follows the Archangel Gabriel's fight to rid purgatory of the Fallen angels and save the souls of its inhabitants. Gabriel is the first full feature directed by Shane Abbess, and it shows. Good cast, good story, good screen play, and no direction on a budget of $150,000. They all took pay cuts for future derivatives on DVD'S with special features. Somehow, I don't think it worked out just right.In Australia most films are financed by the government-this was independent. Insurance was the day before filming-everything was brinksmanship.They lied by dropping scenes from the movie for insurance, then added them back.Seven Fallen Angels are in Purgatory as their domain, while Heaven sends sends Seven Arch Angel to take back control and save the souls of all who live there-but so far the angels sent disappear. Gabriel appears. Angels in Purgatory assume mortal form,(with a soul?) and can die, and have lost almost all of their powers.The ""atmosphere"" in Purgatory is such that it drags the Arch Angels down into decrepit,pitiful shadows of themselves that just want to hide from the Fallen, and not die. Sammael is the Fallen that rules,and he command the others not to kill Gabriel Then it comes down to Angels killing each other.Sammael refuses to fight Gabriel, [why?] admitting he hated being a creature made to serve, but in Purgatory he can control his own destiny and rule, and tempts Gabriel to join him.I'll leave the ending to you-if you can get that far. I feel if it was remade in the US with a budget, & director it would really be a box office hit-great story.",3,"Heaven and Hell fighting over Purgatory,",1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,1631,"['2007', 'Australian', 'film', 'set', 'purgatory.and', 'Archangel', 'Gabriel', 'fight', 'rid', 'purgatory', 'Fallen', 'angels', 'save', 'souls', 'inhabitants', 'Gabriel', 'first', 'full', 'feature', 'directed', 'Shane', 'Abbess', 'Good', 'cast', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'screen', 'play', 'direction', 'budget', '150,000', 'took', 'pay', 'cuts', 'future', 'derivatives', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'Somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'out', 'just', 'right.In', 'Australia', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'financed', 'government-this', 'was', 'independent', 'Insurance', 'was', 'day', 'filming-everything', 'was', 'brinksmanship.They', 'lied', 'dropping', 'scenes', 'movie', 'insurance', 'then', 'added', 'back.Seven', 'Fallen', 'Angels', 'are', 'Purgatory', 'domain', 'Heaven', 'sends', 'Seven', 'Arch', 'Angel', 'take', 'back', 'control', 'save', 'souls', 'who', 'live', 'there-but', 'so', 'far', 'angels', 'sent', 'disappear', 'Gabriel', 'Angels', 'Purgatory', 'assume', 'mortal', 'form', 'soul', 'can', 'die', 'have', 'lost', 'almost', 'powers.The', 'atmosphere', 'Purgatory', 'such', 'Arch', 'Angels', 'down', 'decrepit', 'pitiful', 'shadows', 'just', 'want', 'hide', 'Fallen', 'not', 'die', 'Sammael', 'Fallen', 'rules', 'others', 'not', 'kill', 'Gabriel', 'Then', 'down', 'Angels', 'killing', 'other.Sammael', 'fight', 'Gabriel', '[', 'why', ']', 'admitting', 'hated', 'being', 'creature', 'made', 'serve', 'Purgatory', 'can', 'control', 'own', 'destiny', 'rule', 'tempts', 'Gabriel', 'join', 'him.I', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'ending', 'you-if', 'can', 'get', 'far', 'feel', 'was', 'remade', 'US', 'budget', 'director', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'box', 'office', 'hit-great', 'story']",Gabriel
