305264,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302276578,Acute Observer,"[0, 3]","Cat Ballou, 1965 filmThe story begins with a parade of women on a small town's streets. A woman is in jail before her hanging. [Believable?] The story begins, Catherine is a recent graduate from a teacher school and is being sent unescorted on a journey. She meets another man with a book. Cat is reading a book too. That man surprises the lawman, his prisoner is released. ""Morally wrong."" This story is set in Wyoming. Two men sing in the street. Cat returns to her father's homestead. Is Jackson stubborn? A man appears suddenly, he is a hired killer. [No dog to bark a warning?] There is a dance in town. Wolf City wants the water from Frank Ballou's lands. Jackson advises Cat to hire Kid Shelleen the gunman for protection. Talk leads to a fight with comic violence. Two men visit their ranch, Cat talks to them about the situation.Should Ballou hire a gun fighter? Will the two men help? ""As long as there is no trouble."" Cat writes to Kid Shelleen, he arrives in town. Too much to drink? Shelleen shows his skills, and will stay. He will go up against Tim Straw, silver nose and all. Then Straw shoots Frank and rides away. Cat rides into town, but Silver Nose has an alibi. ""You'll never make me cry."" Cat leaves her ranch to find a new home. How can they raise money? ""Rob a train?"" An argument for progress? Cat reads a novel for ideas. Later she rides in the baggage car with a coffin. ""The Great Train Robbery""? Cat and her buddies escape with the loot. [Paper money instead of specie?] Kid shows his trick riding. [A stunt double.] The townsmen form a group to trail the robbers. [The story runs on.] Silver Nose shows up to ask for the return of the money, then rides away.Kid Shelleen asks for his valise and goes into training. ""No booze."" A corset for looks? He dresses in new clean clothes. Shelleen arrives at a house in town and explores the second floor bedrooms. He finds the right room. There is a shot! Shelleen returns to Cat and tells what happened. ""He was my brother."" But a posse from Wolf City is on the way to get them. ""I don't want to die."" The men fight. Where is Cat go? To see Sir Harry Percival in his luxury coach? Cat pulls a pistol, there is a struggle and a shot. The Sheriff comes for Cat, ""its time"". The people don't like her. Can a minister comfort her in her last hour? The town has a gala celebration. ""Any last words?"" Will help arrive in time? Yes, for a comic ending. Cat rides off into history, the ""Queen of the Outlaws"". [Believable?]When I saw this in 1965 I thought it was a funny comedy. Decades later it seems at best an average movie. You can compare it to the classic western movies of the 1930s and early 1940s. Here the townspeople are willing flunkies of the big industrialist who wants to build a factory to produce merchandise for sale to the east. No one seems to own their own farm or ranch, unlike in the Real West of that era. Wolf City seems to have few families, the homesteaders who really settled the vacant western lands. Cowboys were transients who spent their savings on urban entertainment. They were as mobile as migrant workers. You can compare this story to a TV series like ""Bonanza"" or ""Little House on the Prairie"" for drama. To learn about the censored history of that era read Asa Mercer's ""The Banditti of the Plains"" about the 1890s.",2,A Parody of Old Westerns,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,3320,"['Cat', 'Ballou', '1965', 'filmThe', 'story', 'parade', 'women', 'small', 'town', 'streets', 'woman', 'jail', 'hanging', 'Believable', ']', 'story', 'Catherine', 'recent', 'graduate', 'teacher', 'school', 'being', 'sent', 'unescorted', 'journey', 'man', 'book', 'Cat', 'reading', 'book', 'too', 'man', 'lawman', 'prisoner', 'released', 'Morally', 'wrong', 'story', 'set', 'Wyoming', 'Two', 'men', 'sing', 'street', 'Cat', 'father', 'homestead', 'Jackson', 'stubborn', 'man', 'suddenly', 'hired', 'killer', 'dog', 'bark', 'warning', ']', 'dance', 'town', 'Wolf', 'City', 'water', 'Frank', 'Ballou', 'lands', 'Jackson', 'Cat', 'hire', 'Kid', 'Shelleen', 'gunman', 'protection', 'Talk', 'fight', 'comic', 'violence', 'Two', 'men', 'visit', 'ranch', 'Cat', 'talks', 'situation.Should', 'Ballou', 'gun', 'fighter', 'Will', 'two', 'men', 'help', 'As', 'long', 'trouble', 'Cat', 'Kid', 'Shelleen', 'town', 'Too', 'much', 'drink', 'Shelleen', 'skills', 'will', 'stay', 'will', 'go', 'up', 'Tim', 'Straw', 'silver', 'nose', 'Then', 'Straw', 'shoots', 'Frank', 'away', 'Cat', 'town', 'Silver', 'Nose', 'alibi', ""'ll"", 'never', 'make', 'cry', 'Cat', 'ranch', 'find', 'new', 'home', 'How', 'can', 'raise', 'money', 'Rob', 'train', 'argument', 'progress', 'Cat', 'novel', 'ideas', 'Later', 'baggage', 'car', 'coffin', 'Great', 'Train', 'Robbery', 'Cat', 'buddies', 'escape', 'loot', '[', 'Paper', 'money', 'instead', 'specie', ']', 'Kid', 'trick', 'riding', '[', 'stunt', 'double', ']', 'townsmen', 'form', 'group', 'trail', 'robbers', '[', 'story', ']', 'Silver', 'Nose', 'up', 'ask', 'return', 'money', 'then', 'away.Kid', 'Shelleen', 'valise', 'training', 'booze', 'corset', 'looks', 'new', 'clean', 'clothes', 'Shelleen', 'arrives', 'house', 'town', 'second', 'floor', 'bedrooms', 'right', 'room', 'shot', 'Shelleen', 'Cat', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'brother', 'posse', 'Wolf', 'City', 'way', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'die', 'men', 'fight', 'Where', 'Cat', 'go', 'see', 'Sir', 'Harry', 'Percival', 'luxury', 'coach', 'Cat', 'pistol', 'struggle', 'shot', 'Sheriff', 'Cat', 'time', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Can', 'minister', 'comfort', 'last', 'hour', 'town', 'gala', 'celebration', 'last', 'words', 'Will', 'help', 'arrive', 'time', 'Yes', 'comic', 'ending', 'Cat', 'history', 'Queen', 'Outlaws', '[', 'Believable', ']', 'When', 'saw', '1965', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'comedy', 'Decades', 'later', 'best', 'average', 'movie', 'can', 'compare', 'classic', 'western', 'movies', '1930s', 'early', '1940s', 'Here', 'townspeople', 'are', 'willing', 'flunkies', 'big', 'industrialist', 'who', 'build', 'factory', 'produce', 'merchandise', 'sale', 'east', 'one', 'own', 'own', 'farm', 'ranch', 'Real', 'West', 'era', 'Wolf', 'City', 'have', 'few', 'families', 'homesteaders', 'who', 'really', 'settled', 'vacant', 'western', 'lands', 'Cowboys', 'were', 'transients', 'who', 'spent', 'savings', 'urban', 'entertainment', 'were', 'as', 'mobile', 'migrant', 'workers', 'can', 'compare', 'story', 'TV', 'series', 'Bonanza', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'drama', 'learn', 'censored', 'history', 'era', 'read', 'Asa', 'Mercer', 'Banditti', 'Plains', '1890s']",N/A

The only thing I can say about her in this particular movie, is that she looked stunning and beautiful in 1965, and her performance in this movie is one of the main reasons why ""Cat Ballou"" works so fine.Also, in this movie Lee Marvin played two characters: Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn, both of them very well portrayed, it is really hard to recognize Lee Marvin in the role of Tim Strawn.One of the nicest details in ""Cat Ballou"" is the inclusion of the great Nat ""King"" Cole in the soundtrack of the film, and he also appears in some scenes, singing with Stubby Kaye, a very classy duo, I must say. It's really a pleasure to hear Nat ""King"" Cole's incredible voice in these country songs.Bottom line, the reasons to see ""Cat Ballou"" are: it's a very amusing movie, with a nice performance by a very young and beautiful Jane Fonda (sorry people, I had a crush on her when I saw her in this amusing film), an excellent performance by Lee Marvin, and very good songs performed by the unforgettable Nat ""King"" Cole.",4,A VERY FUNNY WESTERN.,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,1257,"['Definitely', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'charismatic', 'characters', 'original', 'situations.Recently', 'found', 'people', 'hate', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '17', 'years', 'was', 'born', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'particular', 'movie', 'looked', 'stunning', 'beautiful', '1965', 'performance', 'movie', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'so', 'fine.Also', 'movie', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'played', 'two', 'characters', 'Kid', 'Shelleen', 'Tim', 'Strawn', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'really', 'hard', 'recognize', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'role', 'Tim', 'Strawn.One', 'nicest', 'details', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'inclusion', 'great', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'also', 'scenes', 'singing', 'Stubby', 'Kaye', 'very', 'classy', 'duo', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'incredible', 'voice', 'country', 'songs.Bottom', 'line', 'reasons', 'see', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'are', 'very', 'amusing', 'movie', 'nice', 'performance', 'very', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'sorry', 'people', 'had', 'crush', 'when', 'saw', 'amusing', 'film', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'very', 'good', 'songs', 'performed', 'unforgettable', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole']",N/A

In the opening, young Cat(herine) Ballou is returning to the West to be a teacher after her education Back East.  Through no fault of her own, she gets tangled up on the train with two outlaws, a good-looking but decidedly narcissistic type (Michael Callan) and his somewhat dimwitted uncle (Dwayne Hickman).Cat decides to visit her father's ranch first and is shocked to see that the ranch well has been befouled by manure and there is a price on her father's head, all because he refuses to sell the land to a British holding company.  Before too long her father is killed, and she engages the help of a girlhood hero, Kid Sheleen (Lee Marvin) for revenge.  Sheleen turns out to be less than the heroic type, but ultimately Cat's bitterness and the young men's propensity toward crime turn them all into an outlaw gang.Expect gentle ribbing of such Western-movie staples as the black-clad assassin, the barroom brawl, the bawdy house, the train robbery, the righteous preacher-man, the corrupt sheriff, and the pompous capitalist.  The more you know about Westerns the funnier this spoof is, yet if you take your Westerns TOO seriously this might seem a little. . . well . . . sacriligeous.  Jane Fonda is absolutely beautiful in this 36-year-old film, as are the outdoor settings.

Everything about the film must be filled with invective words to get the idea how unimaginably bad it is. And the chief reason? Jane Fonda. Still riding on the coattails of her father, she proves how inane of an actress she is. With the exception of They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, she kills every film with her presence. So, how bad is Cat Ballou? Nat King Cole did some music in it, and then he died. Meanwhile, the peripheral characters are thoroughly awful and harebrained. Finally, Lee Marvin...I think his performance is somewhat interesting because usually he is stoic and lacks range outside of the usual militaristic manner. But in Cat Ballou, he shows a lot of range that I didn't think it was possible. However, his Academy Award win? I don't think so. It is actually a decent performance but nothing special.

305270,A3Y6GNHCOER58,6302276578,Billie Mann,"[4, 4]","Cat Ballou is a movie spoof unlike any other, and a great parody of the Western film genre. Jane Fonda appears in one of her most playful film roles (""Barbarella"" is another light and funny Fonda classic), and Lee Marvin gives one of his finest film performances (he won his Oscar for his dual roles). Add to this mix a wondrous soundtrack, with Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye as minstrels of sorts who stroll and sing throughout, making the film almost seem like a musical; an outstanding supporting cast including Michael Callan (who later appeared on TV's ""One Life to Live""), and Dwayne Hickman (TV's Dobie Gillis), and the result is this hilarious, thoroughly entertaining film that was nominated for five Academy Awards (Marvin was the sole winner).Catherine Ballou (Fonda) is a recently graduated-from-training schoolteacher returning home to live with her father on his ranch, but he is gunned down upon her arrival. She enlists the help of a loyal ranch-hand, a couple of outlaws, and most notably, a has-been alcoholic gunman by the name of Kid Shelleen (Marvin) to help her get revenge. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable film that still stands up today, and Lee Marvin stealing the entire film in his amazing dual role performance as both Tim Strong and Kid Sheleen. Lee Marvin alone makes the film well worth seeing.The dialogue is great. Take this exchange as an example:Jackson Two-Bears: ""Kid, Kid, what a time to fall off the wagon. Look at your eyes.""Kid Shelleen: ""What's wrong with my eyes?""Jackson Two-Bears: ""Well they're red; bloodshot.""Kid Shelleen: ""You ought to see 'em from my side.""I was thrilled when the widescreen special edition of this long-time favorite of mine came out in 2003, and on DVD. I have the soundtrack on vinyl, but I have always wished that it would come out on CD; Nat King Cole is one of my all-time favorite singers, and his rendition of ""They'll Never Make Me Cry"" always makes me...anyway.

305273,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,6302276578,Buenoslibros.es,"[7, 14]","I understand why this film is so high-starred, but it simply does not deserve the five stars, nor the four. I'll try to explain. The director, as he admits in the little extra piece, intended to make a comedy in the West. He put together the basic ingredients for it: a beautiful Fonda, two young simpletons that aren't Western material -more fit for Broadway-, and a funny drunkard. Silverstein didn't have a clear idea of what kind of film was going to come out of this (as happens to all bad directors) but when he saw Lee Marvin act his role, he had one moment of lucidness, even brilliance, he told Marvin to try to make us cry instead of laugh. Boy, did that make a difference! Lee Marvin steals the show totally.Lee Marvin was a great, a fantastic actor. But he belonged to a past era, when real Westerns were shot, when classic directors still hung around the movie studios. That day had gone, not for him, obviously, but for the industry.

305274,A1XPGRB6C8CKI6,6302276578,"Carlos Burning ""Carlos""","[6, 7]","Although ""Cat Ballou"" is usually categorized as a Western Comedy, this film actually resembles a musical; in fact, the songs chanted by balladeers Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye are at the heart of ""Cat Ballou.""The emotional range of these pieces is quite impressive--ranging from the principal ballad's ironic high-spirits, through the poignancy of ""They'll never make her cry"" to the sublime ridicule of ""And now you are old.""  That final song, which sounds as though it were actually written in the 1890's, is a hilarious outpouring of moralistic sentimentality--appropriately sung in an Old West brothel!  It's noteworthy that the balladeers always appear in front of the camera--never as mere background music performers.  Thus singing in the streets, on the prairie, etc., they literally accompany the action in the same way that Japanese musicians appear onstage during a kabuki drama performance: they become an intrinsic part of what their songs are interpreting.  Naturally, the presence of these troubadours undermines any sense of film ""realism.""  However, I have no problem with such unreality; ""realism"" in any art form, including films, is never real enough.  Furthermore, the fantastic presence of singers Cole and Kaye following the principal characters around certainly seems consonant with the film's overall atmosphere--which is more fairy tale than hard & gritty editorial.The script itself is fairly light-weigh but coherent; it concerns would-be schoolmarm Catharine Ballou (played charmingly by Jane Fonda) revenging her father's murder at the hands of land-grabbing outlaws in 1890's Wyoming.  To further her plans for vengeance--or justice-- she enlists the help of two rather gun-shy outlaws--Michael Callan, with whom she falls in love, and Dwayne Hickman, in a hilarious performance as Callan's unlikely ""uncle.""  She also hires a fantastically gin-soaked gunslinger whom she once idolized from the accounts she read of him in pulp Westerns; the gunman (played flamboyantly by Lee Marvin) manages to sober up long enough to kill Catharine's main antagonist (a noseless monstrosity also acted by Marvin).  Along the way, Cat manages to lead a daring train robbery, thus achieving ""outlaw"" status herself.  Further, she finally kills the villain who masterminded her father's murder--which results in her being charged with murder, and inevitably sentenced to hang.  Literally in the nick of time she escapes the rope in a scene which is stunning, brilliant cinema; no surprise that Stanley Kubrick used one of these climactic moments in his own masterpiece ""A Clockwork Orange.""As the songs that pervade ""Cat Ballou"" give significance to the action, the actors themselves prove worthy of their balladeers.  Young Jane Fonda is indescribably appealing--an amalgam of sheer beauty and talent that I can only call ""immortal.""  As her love interest, Michael Callan seems rather unworthy--but who wouldn't be?  As for Dwayne Hickman (TV's original ""Dobie Gillis""): he gives a delighful performance, particularly in his initial scene as a fake, but truly drunk, preacher.  His introductory line to Jane Fonda is classic in its delivery--""I'm drunk as a skunk!""  By contrast, Lee Marvin's gunslinger character seems a bit overdone (his Academy Award for the part notwithstanding).  But a fine excess may be considered part and parcel of ""Cat Ballou.""  In any event, this film remains a rarity: 40 years after its release it remains consistently watchable, even lovable-- while many more ambitious/pretentious films have ridden off into the sunset.",5,Kabuki In The Far West,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,3567,"['Cat', 'Ballou', 'usually', 'categorized', 'Western', 'Comedy', 'film', 'actually', 'musical', 'fact', 'songs', 'chanted', 'balladeers', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'Stubby', 'Kaye', 'are', 'heart', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'emotional', 'range', 'pieces', 'quite', 'impressive', 'ranging', 'principal', 'ballad', 'ironic', 'high-spirits', 'poignancy', ""'ll"", 'never', 'make', 'cry', 'sublime', 'ridicule', 'now', 'are', 'old', 'final', 'song', 'were', 'actually', 'written', '1890', 'hilarious', 'outpouring', 'moralistic', 'sentimentality', 'appropriately', 'sung', 'Old', 'West', 'brothel', 'noteworthy', 'balladeers', 'always', 'appear', 'front', 'camera', 'never', 'mere', 'background', 'music', 'performers', 'Thus', 'singing', 'streets', 'prairie', 'etc.', 'literally', 'accompany', 'action', 'same', 'way', 'Japanese', 'musicians', 'appear', 'onstage', 'kabuki', 'drama', 'performance', 'become', 'intrinsic', 'part', 'what', 'songs', 'are', 'interpreting', 'Naturally', 'presence', 'troubadours', 'undermines', 'sense', 'film', 'realism', 'However', 'have', 'problem', 'such', 'unreality', 'realism', 'art', 'form', 'including', 'films', 'never', 'real', 'enough', 'Furthermore', 'fantastic', 'presence', 'singers', 'Cole', 'Kaye', 'following', 'principal', 'characters', 'certainly', 'consonant', 'film', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'fairy', 'tale', 'hard', 'gritty', 'editorial.The', 'script', 'fairly', 'light-weigh', 'coherent', 'would-be', 'schoolmarm', 'Catharine', 'Ballou', 'played', 'charmingly', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'revenging', 'father', 'murder', 'hands', 'land-grabbing', 'outlaws', '1890', 'Wyoming', 'further', 'plans', 'vengeance', 'justice', 'help', 'two', 'rather', 'gun-shy', 'outlaws', 'Michael', 'Callan', 'whom', 'love', 'Dwayne', 'Hickman', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'Callan', 'unlikely', 'uncle', 'also', 'fantastically', 'gin-soaked', 'gunslinger', 'whom', 'once', 'idolized', 'accounts', 'read', 'pulp', 'Westerns', 'gunman', 'played', 'flamboyantly', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'sober', 'up', 'long', 'enough', 'kill', 'Catharine', 'main', 'antagonist', 'noseless', 'monstrosity', 'also', 'acted', 'Marvin', 'way', 'Cat', 'lead', 'daring', 'train', 'robbery', 'thus', 'achieving', 'outlaw', 'status', 'Further', 'finally', 'villain', 'who', 'masterminded', 'father', 'murder', 'results', 'being', 'charged', 'murder', 'inevitably', 'sentenced', 'hang', 'Literally', 'nick', 'time', 'rope', 'scene', 'stunning', 'brilliant', 'cinema', 'surprise', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'used', 'one', 'climactic', 'moments', 'own', 'masterpiece', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'songs', 'pervade', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'give', 'significance', 'action', 'actors', 'prove', 'worthy', 'balladeers', 'Young', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'indescribably', 'appealing', 'amalgam', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'talent', 'can', 'only', 'call', 'immortal', 'love', 'interest', 'Michael', 'Callan', 'rather', 'unworthy', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Dwayne', 'Hickman', 'TV', 'original', 'Dobie', 'Gillis', 'delighful', 'performance', 'particularly', 'initial', 'scene', 'fake', 'truly', 'drunk', 'preacher', 'introductory', 'line', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'classic', 'delivery', ""'m"", 'drunk', 'skunk', 'contrast', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'gunslinger', 'character', 'bit', 'overdone', 'Academy', 'Award', 'part', 'notwithstanding', 'fine', 'excess', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'part', 'parcel', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'event', 'film', 'rarity', '40', 'years', 'release', 'consistently', 'watchable', 'even', 'lovable', 'many', 'more', 'ambitious/pretentious', 'films', 'have', 'ridden', 'off', 'sunset']",N/A

Catherine ""Cat"" Ballou (Fonda)--called ""wicked,"" ""evil,"" ""depraved,"" and a ""jezebel"" by her outraged townsfolk--""could have lived like others do"" if she'd been willing to ignore injustice.  She graduates from normal school in 1894 and returns to Wolf City, Wyoming, outside which her widowed father Frankie (John Marley) keeps a horse ranch.  To her dismay there are Big Augurs moving into the area who ""want your daddy's water rights"" and have hired a gunman, silver-nosed Tim Strawn, to force him off his land.  At the suggestion of her new friend, Frankie's Sioux bronc stomper Jackson Two Bears (Tom Nardini), she writes to Kid Shelleen (Marvin), a famous gunfighter and her dime-novel hero, asking for his help.  Shelleen's willing enough, but he turns out to be a broken-down has-been with far too great a thirst for whiskey, and he can't prevent Frankie's murder.  Sponsored by Clay Boone (Michael Callan) and his same-age Uncle Jed (Dwayne Hickman), a pair of small-time rustlers she met on the train home, Cat relocates to the infamous outlaw sanctuary of Hole-in-the-Wall, where she masterminds a train robbery that turns out even more successful than she'd hoped, inspires Shelleen to sober up and seek out Strawn, and finally goes in search of Sir Harry Percival (Reginald Denny), owner of Wolf City Development, who was behind Frankie's death--and ends up facing a noose.  Probably the high point of the movie is Marvin in his dual role as Shelleen and Strawn; that statuette of his was richly deserved.

Marvin's work here does not hold a candle to the work of Rod Steiger in ""The Pawnbroker"" and Richard Burton in ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" who both lost the Oscar to Marvin.  Oscar righted itself two years later by rewarding Steiger for ""In the Heat of the Night"" but gold was never bestowed on Burton despite seven nods.

305294,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,6302276578,Great Movie Addict,"[11, 18]","This brand of low camp, which was all the rage in the 60's, is a hodgepodge of mugging, sight gags, and one-liners that misfire about 75% of the time, or which -- in a few blatant instances -- are flatly unfunny. Jane gives it a good go, as she usually does, but there just doesn't seem to be enough substance in the script to nourish her effort. A mis-cast Callan and Hickman in supporting roles don't help much. The movie's purpose may have been satire, but it most often plays as overdone burlesque. There are several fun moments, yet the clever device involving a drunken has-been gunfighter has much promise but a severely limited delivery. Marvin, one of the most mannered and long-lived Method actors of all time, gets an Oscar here, apparently for his ability to avoid any and all subtlety whatsoever -- he embodies this film's major failing. It's all too ""posed"", in the way that Method actors always look as if they're acting, seldom convincing enough to get the viewer completely involved. Could have been much better, but it's really just heavy-handed eccentricity with no consistent viewpoint about itself. A few years later, ""Butch Cassidy"" and ""True Grit"" would get much closer to what ""Cat"" was trying to do. Meanwhile, many seem to enjoy this takeoff on generic tv westerns; approach it with a reasonable level of lowered expectations, and you'll get a few chuckles.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","Before she got notorious for being all activist-y, it's worth noting that Jane Fonda sizzled on the big screen way back in the '60s. And CAT BALLOU is the film that ushered in her stardom... and established her sex symbol rep, which BARBARELLA then cemented. Almost five decades later, CAT BALLOU has managed to retain its goofy charm. How can a film be raucous and a bit bawdy and still come off as innocent? Except that that's how they used to do it back in the day.You view the opening scene and hear the singing minstrels, and you see ""Cat"" Ballou behind bars in her virginal white gown and the gallows nearby. And you get the immediate sense that finishing school didn't do so thorough a job on this prim and proper aspiring school marm. On her train ride back home, Ms. Catherine Ballou is seen sneaking a peek at a western dime novel. And, not too long after, she abets the getaway of two train robbers. So, when she learns that her family ranch is in jeopardy and when her father is shot down cold-bloodedly, there's no surprise when she decides to take matters into her own hands.If degenerate land speculators can hire an intimidating gunslinger, why can't Catherine Ballou? Aiming to hit back hard at the railroad company that railroaded her, she recruits her own posse of no-good-niks, consisting of two bank robbers, a westernized Injun, and the notorious Kid Shelleen. Except that Kid Shelleen turns out to be the drunkenest, most over-the-hill gun-for-hire in the West who, when he's cravin' that booze somethin' bad, literally cannot hit the side of the barn. Still, off they go on a rootin' tootin' robbery spree, the legend of ""Cat"" Ballou growing with each daring heist.CAT BALLOU isn't the first send-up of the horse opera. Westerns like THE PALEFACE, ALONG CAME JONES and DESTRY RIDES AGAIN had already blazed that trail. It isn't even the best western satire, that falls to SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF. But CAT BALLOU rides on the sparkling performances and on several neat swerves. I think it's important to note that the story stays true to its internal narrative, instead of capsizing into all-out slapstick like BLAZING SADDLES (which, by the way, is fine if you're in the mood for that). But, by adhering to a certain level of gravity, the film encourages the viewer to invest even more into the story and the cast. Again, SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF is the best example of a film that perfectly toes that balance of seriousness and spoof.Jane Fonda has a thankless role, really. She plays it straight throughout the film, allowing others to get the laughs. But her performance is absolutely crucial, and I love her spunk here. Lee Marvin is the revelation. Everyone had been so used to seeing him play these tough guy roles that it was a friggin' startlement when Marvin exhibited his heretofore unsuspected comic talents. His interpretation of the tin-nosed Tim Strawn and the boozy Kid Shelleen won him the Oscar for Best Actor. Probably the most iconic image from this movie features Kid Shelleen slumped against a wall astride his equally inebriated horse. And I'll also mention that whenever Lee Marvin isn't on screen, the comedy suffers.One of the joys of this film is Nat ""King"" Cole and Stubby Kaye serving as the story's Greek chorus. As the banjo-strumming troubadours invisible to the rest of the cast, they surface periodically to sing songs and advance the plot. This was such a tremendous plot device that, decades later, you can't much blame LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY for lifting it.The DVD's bonus stuff: A genial Audio Commentary by actors Michael Callan and Dwayne Hickman; the informative and all too brief featurette ""The Legend Of Cat Ballou"" as director Elliot Silverstein reflects about the film (00:12:36 minutes long); a gallery of ""Vintage Advertising"" - 9 promotional photos, mostly in the form of lobby cards; Talent Files - which are filmographies of the director Elliot Silverstein and the six main actors; and Theatrical Trailers including one for CAT BALLOU.",4,"""She has the smile of an angel (fights like the devil).""",1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,4047,"['got', 'notorious', 'being', 'activist-y', 'worth', 'noting', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'sizzled', 'big', 'screen', 'way', 'back', ""'60s"", 'CAT', 'BALLOU', 'film', 'ushered', 'stardom', 'established', 'sex', 'symbol', 'rep', 'BARBARELLA', 'then', 'cemented', 'Almost', 'five', 'decades', 'later', 'CAT', 'BALLOU', 'managed', 'retain', 'goofy', 'charm', 'How', 'can', 'film', 'be', 'raucous', 'bit', 'bawdy', 'still', 'come', 'off', 'innocent', 'how', 'used', 'do', 'back', 'day.You', 'view', 'opening', 'scene', 'hear', 'singing', 'minstrels', 'see', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'bars', 'virginal', 'white', 'gown', 'gallows', 'nearby', 'get', 'immediate', 'sense', 'finishing', 'school', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'job', 'prim', 'proper', 'aspiring', 'school', 'marm', 'train', 'ride', 'back', 'home', 'Ms.', 'Catherine', 'Ballou', 'seen', 'sneaking', 'peek', 'western', 'dime', 'novel', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'getaway', 'two', 'train', 'robbers', 'So', 'when', 'family', 'ranch', 'jeopardy', 'when', 'father', 'shot', 'down', 'cold-bloodedly', 'surprise', 'when', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands.If', 'degenerate', 'land', 'speculators', 'can', 'hire', 'intimidating', 'gunslinger', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Catherine', 'Ballou', 'Aiming', 'hit', 'back', 'hard', 'railroad', 'company', 'railroaded', 'own', 'posse', 'no-good-niks', 'consisting', 'two', 'bank', 'robbers', 'westernized', 'Injun', 'notorious', 'Kid', 'Shelleen', 'Kid', 'Shelleen', 'out', 'be', 'drunkenest', 'most', 'over-the-hill', 'gun-for-hire', 'West', 'who', 'when', 'cravin', 'booze', 'somethin', 'bad', 'literally', 'can', 'not', 'hit', 'side', 'barn', 'Still', 'go', 'rootin', 'tootin', 'robbery', 'spree', 'legend', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'growing', 'daring', 'heist.CAT', 'BALLOU', ""n't"", 'first', 'send-up', 'horse', 'opera', 'Westerns', 'PALEFACE', 'ALONG', 'CAME', 'JONES', 'DESTRY', 'RIDES', 'AGAIN', 'had', 'already', 'blazed', 'trail', ""n't"", 'even', 'best', 'western', 'satire', 'SUPPORT', 'YOUR', 'LOCAL', 'SHERIFF', 'CAT', 'BALLOU', 'sparkling', 'performances', 'several', 'neat', 'swerves', 'think', 'important', 'note', 'story', 'true', 'internal', 'narrative', 'instead', 'capsizing', 'all-out', 'slapstick', 'BLAZING', 'SADDLES', 'way', 'fine', ""'re"", 'mood', 'adhering', 'certain', 'level', 'gravity', 'film', 'viewer', 'invest', 'even', 'more', 'story', 'cast', 'Again', 'SUPPORT', 'YOUR', 'LOCAL', 'SHERIFF', 'best', 'example', 'film', 'perfectly', 'balance', 'seriousness', 'spoof.Jane', 'Fonda', 'thankless', 'role', 'really', 'straight', 'film', 'allowing', 'others', 'get', 'laughs', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'crucial', 'love', 'spunk', 'here', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'revelation', 'Everyone', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'used', 'seeing', 'play', 'tough', 'guy', 'roles', 'was', 'friggin', 'startlement', 'when', 'Marvin', 'exhibited', 'heretofore', 'unsuspected', 'comic', 'talents', 'interpretation', 'tin-nosed', 'Tim', 'Strawn', 'boozy', 'Kid', 'Shelleen', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Probably', 'most', 'iconic', 'image', 'movie', 'Kid', 'Shelleen', 'slumped', 'wall', 'equally', 'inebriated', 'horse', ""'ll"", 'also', 'mention', 'whenever', 'Lee', 'Marvin', ""n't"", 'screen', 'comedy', 'suffers.One', 'joys', 'film', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'Stubby', 'Kaye', 'serving', 'story', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'banjo-strumming', 'troubadours', 'invisible', 'rest', 'cast', 'surface', 'periodically', 'sing', 'songs', 'advance', 'plot', 'was', 'such', 'tremendous', 'plot', 'device', 'decades', 'later', 'ca', ""n't"", 'much', 'blame', 'LITTLE', 'SHOP', 'OF', 'HORRORS', 'THERE', 'SOMETHING', 'ABOUT', 'MARY', 'lifting', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'genial', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Callan', 'Dwayne', 'Hickman', 'informative', 'too', 'brief', 'featurette', 'Legend', 'Cat', 'Ballou', 'director', 'Elliot', 'Silverstein', 'film', '00:12:36', 'minutes', 'long', 'gallery', 'Vintage', 'Advertising', '9', 'promotional', 'photos', 'mostly', 'form', 'lobby', 'cards', 'Talent', 'Files', 'are', 'filmographies', 'director', 'Elliot', 'Silverstein', 'six', 'main', 'actors', 'Theatrical', 'Trailers', 'including', 'one', 'CAT', 'BALLOU']",N/A

My perception of her is in keeping with her Barbarella/Klute image. I think she is a lousy &%#$. After seeing this film, however, I have to admit the lady does have some talent. Maybe ""lady"" is too strong a word.This is a delightful comedy. Ms. Fonda plays an ""innocent"" schoolteacher whose father is killed by the local land baron in a western town. She vows revenge  and gets it with the help of ""a sex maniac"", ""his uncle"", an Indian (stellar performance) and a drunken gunfighter. In the process, everyone racks up the laughs except for Fonda who plays the ""straight man"" extremely well. Nat King Cole makes his last appearance in this film before losing his battle with cancer. He plays a minstrel who, with Stubby Kaye, keeps the audience informed as to the progress of the story. It all comes together remarkably well.Fonda has never had any trouble appearing beautiful. She does an excellent job of that in this film. More important, though, is her sense of timing and setting up the antics of the other characters. She also manages to make herself a sympathetic character. I never would have thought I could feel that way about her.Lee Marvin steals the show as the drunken gunfighter, Kid Shelleen, and as Shelleen's mortal enemy and brother, Tim Strawn. He does not get as much screen time as one might expect but every second is precious.This is an extravagant comedy. It evokes earlier westerns and pokes fun at them in a good natured way while poking fun at itself.

It's the story of Katherine Ballou, nicknamed ""Cat"" and played by Jane Fonda, who comes home to her small Wyoming town after studying to be a schoolmarm.  However, because her father refuses to sell his land to the speculators, he is brutally murdered.  She goes gunning for revenge.  But this is a comedy and it's all very lighthearted, especially since there are constant musical narratives by Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole.  Lee Marvin won an academy award for his excellent portrayal of two aging outlaw gunmen and he's great.  It's worth seeing, just to see his performance as he's a master not just of facial expressions, but also of total body language.  Jane Fonda looks pretty as the sweet-young-thing turned outlaw.  And there's enough love interest and comical episodes to keep the story moving.  There's a train-robbing incident that is quite funny.  And, of course, there's a happy ending.I'm not much for comedies and so that fact that I was willing to spend the 96 minutes watching it all the way through says a lot for it.

305308,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6302276578,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[9, 10]","This movie combines the seriousness of western with light humor to create a movie that nearly holds a niche by itself.  Catherine ""Cat"" Ballou is an innocent school teacher returning home to the family ranch, where she finds that her father is slowly being driven off the ranch.  She also encounters characters during her return home and on the family ranch that are quite unusual.Initially Catherine (Jane Fonda) plays a complete innocent.  We meet Catherine on a train, where she encounters two men, one, Clay Boone (Michael Callan) is in handcuffs.  The other is a drunken preacher named Jed (Dwayne Hickman), who carries a bible that has hidden attributes.  Jed's often repeated line is ""Ma'am, I apologize for my disgusting condition and I assure you I will not inflict myself on you any further.""  Soon Catherine finds herself in her delicates with Clay Boone next to her as he makes his escape from the sheriff and leaves the train, stealing a kiss from beautiful Catherine in the process.On her return home, Catherine quickly realizes that something is wrong.  The cattle and horses are gone, and everything appears run down.  Native American Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini) is now working for her father.  Jackson behaves in a most uncharacteristic fashion compared to the typical stereotype of Native Americans as usually portrayed in the 1960s.  Jackson frequently makes comments on things white men usually think about Native Americans, with the point typically being that they are wrong.  Soon Clay Boone and Jed also show up, and Catherine begs them all to protect her father from noseless killer Tim Strawn (Lee Marvin).  In spite of Catherine's best efforts Strawn cold-bloodedly murders her father.  Soon Catherine is being thrown off the family ranch.To help protect her father, Catherine wrote to gunfighter Kid Shelleen (Marvin, in a second role), sending him $50 as a retainer.  When Shelleen shows up it turns out that he is a drunkard.  However, having read a number of stories about the famous Kid Shelleen, Catherine retains faith in him.Soon Cat is encouraging the others to rob a train to get back at those who harmed her father.  When the robbery nets far more than expected, Sir Harry Percival (Reginald Denny) sends Strawn after Cat, initially to encourage Cat to return the money.  When Kid Shelleen realizes that Strawn is about, he sobers up quickly, and in an excellent series of scenes, transforms from a drunken slob into a genuine gunfighter.  After Kid Shelleen and Strawn take care of their business, Cat goes to talk to Sir Harry Percival to get him to sign a confession that he ordered her father's death.  When he refuses, the gun goes off and Cat ends up in jail, on a trip to the gallows, once more looking heart-breakingly beautiful and innocent.We have musical narrators throughout this movie, in the form of Professor Sam the Shade (Nat King Cole) and The Sunrise Kid (Stubby Kaye).While the pair are occasionally distracting, the songs are generally good, and are often used to introduce the upcoming scene.  This appearance was Cole's last, as he passed away several months before the release of the film.There are several standout performances in this movie, including Jane Fonda's.  However, the best performance is that of Lee Marvin in the dual roles.  Lee Marvin was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1966 for his performance.  He also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Foreign Actor, the Silver Berlin Bear at the International Berlin Film Festival, the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actor in a Musical or Comedy, the Laurel Award for Male Comedy Performance, and the National Board of Review award for Best Actor.  In total, this movie received 12 nominations for various awards and won 10 awards.  If there had been such an award, the horse Marvin used near the end of the film should have received an award as well, as the horse appears to look as down and out as the horse's rider.This movie does not have the raw and riotous humor of ""Blazing Saddles.""  The book on which this movie was based was a serious western.  The humorous elements were added to change the tone of the movie.  The humor is not as subtle as the humor in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""  However, there are numerous places where the script gets a smile, and there are several worthy of a laugh.This DVD contains a number of extras of varying value.  The ""Legend of Cat Ballou"" may be the best feature.  The audio commentary is interesting, if you like hearing nostalgic memories of how a movie was made.One small detail I noticed.  Kid Shelleen sang ""Happy Birthday"" at one point in the movie.  The lyrics for ""Happy Birthday"" were not written until the next century, and each time I see that scene I must admit I am slightly distracted by the relatively glaring inaccuracy.  There are other inaccuracies, but they are typically more subtle.I originally saw this movie in 1965 when it was released.  I am surprised and pleased that the movie has aged well.  While some recall Jane Fonda with distaste for her behavior a few years later, here Fonda is beautiful and perfect for this part.  Lee Marvin reminds us all of why he was considered a great actor.  If you consider yourself a fan of westerns, or Lee Marvin, and if you liked movies like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" and ""Two Mules for Sister Sara,"" I think you will enjoy this one as well.",5,I will not inflict myself on you further,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,5472,"['movie', 'seriousness', 'western', 'light', 'humor', 'create', 'movie', 'nearly', 'niche',

They gave her a very wholesome look, with her hair especially youthful looking. Pretty much all the guys in the baby boomer generation fell in love with her when they saw this film in 1965, whether they were five or 25. And pretty much all the characters in the film fall in love with her as well. This was her first film targeted at the boomer demographic and her young appearance and relative obscurity were deceptive to her new fans. Six years later when ""Klute"" was released folks were staggered by how used up she looked, generally because everyone had just assumed that she was younger.In 1965 it was revolutionary  to see a film with such a strong, determined, brave, and resourceful young woman, especially for a western. Although Joan Crawford, Shelley Winters, and Peggy Castle had previously played tough saloon owners, there had never been anyone quite like Fonda's character. ""The times were a changin"" or at least beginning to change and this film both reflected and contributed to these changes.If you are thinking of watching ""Cat Ballou"" for the first time be aware that it has the standard 1960's western production design. Things are very studio back lot, very clean, and extremely orderly (insert not authentic here). And although classified as a comedy it is as much mild action/adventure as comedy. The humorous elements are mostly supplied by Lee Marvin doing a parody of the heavy roles he usually played.Stubby Kaye and Nat ""King"" Cole bookend the film as banjo playing western minstrels and also function as musical narrators who pop up within scenes throughout the movie, singing the story as it unfolds. This really complicates the staging of these scenes and it is worth just paying attention to the clever ways they are worked into the scenes.After an introduction the story flashes back and then proceeds linearly forward, by the end they are back to the time of the introduction. The flashback first finds Catherine (Cat) Ballou boarding a train after completing finishing school. She is returning to her father's Wyoming ranch. On the trip she is reading a pulp western about a gunfighter named Kid Shelleen (Marvin). She meets escaping rustler Clay Boone (Michael Callan) and his drunk Uncle Jed (Dwayne Hickman) who is dressed as a preacher. She arrives home to find her father's ranch in bad shape. Her father is being pressured to sell out to a British railroad baron.""Cat Ballou"" is a fun film with a nice soundtrack. Fonda and Marvin are especially good.Then again, what do I know?

The heroine is named Catherine 'Cat' Ballou. Her gang includes her own hired killer who is played by Lee Marvin. Marvin also doubles as the noseless shooter who kills Cat's father.The film sets a standard for parodies of the Old West. Marvin's dual performances are memorable to say the least - particularly his antics as the inebriated Kid Shelleen. His ability to play a drunk is unmatched. Do you recall the marriage scene in PAINT YOUR WAGON?The novel device of using Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole and Stubby Kaye to amplify the story with original ballads is more than just unique. It represents a brilliant matching of two great talents and it stands the test of time very well.Lee Marvin won the Best Actor Oscar for his twin roles.

Badly directed, the ""comedy"" is heavy handed and extremely forced, made worse by an inept supporting cast.  Jane Fonda is adequate, but has zero chemistry with Michael Callan (who went on to have basically no career at all), thus depriving the film of a center, while Dwayne Hickman has nothing to do but stand around.  Lee Marvin eats the scenery and the several laughs in the movie belong to him.  But he tries too hard and is often as unfunny as he is funny.  Despite his oscar, this is one of his worst performances.  The song interludes wear thin very quickly, with the songs simply telling us what we've already seen.  So even though it's not a long film, the songs make it seems much, much longer.  The Jewish jokes are embarrassing, and the slapstick is poorly done.

Lee Marvin's performance is deservedly famous, but the whole cast seemed to be inspired by the hilarious script and by each others performances, as the movie rides a funny crest from start to finish.  The movie is by turn dramatic, slapstick, goofy, witty, sexy, and always irreverent.  Seldom does one film have so many vividly memorable scenes and clever dialogue throughout.  Guess you could say it is the 'Casablanca' of western comedies!  There is also great stunt work and some fine cinematography.  One of my favorite small moments is the 'misdirection play' the script plays on both the audience and the titular character as she awaits the Kid's arrival.  A definite bonus, as has been pointed out, is Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye as the minstrels, who, unseen by the movie's characters, help to move the plot along as a modern day Greek Chorus.  The opening number, 'The Ballad of Cat Ballou', which is reprised throughout the movie, is immensely appealing.  It earned one of the movie's five Oscar nominations, but only Lee Marvin won, for 'Best Actor'.  Sadly, this was Nat's final film, as he was dying of lung cancer during the filming.

My main reason for wanting it was the two characters that Mr. Marvin portrayed. I loved his Kid Schaleen character, but had used the &#34;Strawn&#34; character as a model for a character I played in stunt shows (minus the silver nose). He was a very villainous presence.

Lee Marvin is very deserving of his Oscar, as scene stealer Kid Shelleen.  This drunken gun slinger manages to  miss the broad side of a barn.  Jane Fonda is great as the revenge seeking  Cat Balou.  &quot;The face of an angel, fights like the  devil.&quot;However, the real treat of this film is the pair of  wandering minstrels.  Stubby Kaye (Nicely Nicely in Guys and Dolls) strums  around with Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole providing a lovely soundtrack.
