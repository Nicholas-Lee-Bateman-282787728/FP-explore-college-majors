948519,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000BR6QIM,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Young Mr. Lincoln, 1939 filmThis is the Hollywood history of a young Abraham Lincoln in Illinois. It tells about life in the new settlements of Illinois. It shows the entertainment of that day (log splitting, pie baking, tug of war, etc.). These activities were based on practical work for these rural people. The biggest part is the trial of two men for a murder during a fight. One man was fighting two brothers after dusk, then pulled a pistol and fired a shot after being knocked to the ground. Yes, they all had a few drinks before their struggle. The man on the ground was found dead from a stab wound in the heart. One of the men owned the knife. These two brothers are arrested and put on trial for murder.Their poor family (a mother and two sisters) hired a new lawyer, Abraham Lincoln. The state has an experienced prosecutor. Another man testified he saw the killing from 100 yards away in the moonlight. Does the almanac support the claim of bright moonlight? Lincoln questions him and gets an admission that will free his clients. [Some call this a ""Perry Mason moment"", as if it didn't happen in real life.] The two men are found not guilty after the crime is linked to another man. Later the family of the two men pack their wagon and move on to a new location. Defendants who are found `not guilty' often face prejudice from people who love to look down on others. Lincoln says he will move on to higher things.This is an entertaining story about one of the most famous presidents in US history.",4,Murder by Moonlight,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,1511,"['Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', '1939', 'filmThis', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'young', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Illinois', 'life', 'new', 'settlements', 'Illinois', 'entertainment', 'day', 'log', 'splitting', 'pie', 'baking', 'tug', 'war', 'etc.', 'activities', 'were', 'based', 'practical', 'work', 'rural', 'people', 'biggest', 'part', 'trial', 'two', 'men', 'murder', 'fight', 'One', 'man', 'was', 'fighting', 'two', 'brothers', 'dusk', 'then', 'pulled', 'pistol', 'fired', 'shot', 'being', 'knocked', 'ground', 'Yes', 'had', 'few', 'drinks', 'struggle', 'man', 'ground', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'stab', 'wound', 'heart', 'One', 'men', 'owned', 'knife', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'arrested', 'put', 'trial', 'murder.Their', 'poor', 'family', 'mother', 'two', 'sisters', 'hired', 'new', 'lawyer', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'state', 'experienced', 'prosecutor', 'man', 'testified', 'saw', 'killing', '100', 'yards', 'away', 'moonlight', 'almanac', 'support', 'claim', 'bright', 'moonlight', 'Lincoln', 'questions', 'admission', 'will', 'free', 'clients', '[', 'call', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'moment', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'real', 'life', ']', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'crime', 'linked', 'man', 'Later', 'family', 'two', 'men', 'pack', 'wagon', 'move', 'new', 'location', 'Defendants', 'who', 'are', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'often', 'face', 'prejudice', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'look', 'down', 'others', 'Lincoln', 'will', 'move', 'higher', 'things.This', 'entertaining', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'presidents', 'US', 'history']",N/A
948520,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000BR6QIM,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 8]","Before I get lambasted by some ignorant readers here for `being too young to appreciate these older films', do yourselves a favor (and me too) and read through some of my reviews before making such a sweeping statement that is laced with blatant falsehood.Okay, now that I got that out of the way...It is really the blatant obviousness about this film that upsets me.  The film is one walking clich&eacute; with ridiculous setup to scenes that lack the internal importance they think they contain.  Scenes that are supposed to bolster our interest in the great man that was Abe Lincoln fail to validate any of our feelings because they come off thoughtless and seemingly lazy in structure and tone (not something I expected from John Ford).  I understand that this is not a film about Lincoln the president but a film about Lincoln the little known lawyer, but it lacks any real depth.  Some may balk at my statement and claim that the depth can be found in the films subtle tones, but I don't find anything subtle about a film that wears its every intention on its sleeves.  Sure, there is an obvious lack of manipulated drama here, but that doesn't mean that this film is `subtle', it just means that it is slow.From the stagy way that Lincoln comes across his destiny to the lackluster way in which the court proceedings are carried out (not to mention the fact that they lack any and all believability, what with their ridiculous outcries and unbelievable testimonies), `Young Mr. Lincoln' comes up short almost everywhere.And let's not forget about the performances.Henry Fonda (in fact, the whole Fonda clan) is hit or miss with me.  Henry himself seems to play a variation of the same character in a lot of what he does.  His take on Abraham Lincoln seems like a less poignant version of Peck's Atticus Finch (I know that `To Kill a Mockingbird' was made AFTER this film, it is just a comparison).  Besides the harrowing physical presence he brings to the role, his performance lacks real notability.  He kind of disappears into the scenes, meandering in his own mind and delivering his lines in a way that reads `Fonda', not `Lincoln'.  I felt that Alice Brady was a never-ending clich&eacute; who couldn't manage to break herself out of the constraints of the script.  In fact, nearly everyone with a speaking role fits that bill for me.And yet, the film is beautiful to look at, as are most of John Ford's films.Lincoln the man was a very intriguing and poignant figure in American history, and so I was disheartened to find this film lacking any real gusto.  I really hope that Spielberg gets his Lincoln biopic off the ground (Liam Neeson, come of down and retrieve your Oscar!).Alas, I cannot recommend this dud of a film, regardless of the general consensus of the film.  Like I've stated in another review, just because it was made many years ago by a profound director, staring a respected actor does not mean that it is beyond reproach.  We should be able to approach these films (and thus our reviews) with an air of objectiveness.  I hope you can read my review with that same courtesy.",2,This film is very lacking...,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,3105,"['get', 'lambasted', 'ignorant', 'readers', 'here', 'being', 'too', 'young', 'appreciate', 'older', 'films', 'do', 'favor', 'too', 'read', 'reviews', 'making', 'such', 'sweeping', 'statement', 'laced', 'blatant', 'falsehood.Okay', 'now', 'got', 'way', 'really', 'blatant', 'obviousness', 'film', 'film', 'one', 'walking', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridiculous', 'setup', 'scenes', 'lack', 'internal', 'importance', 'think', 'contain', 'Scenes', 'are', 'supposed', 'bolster', 'interest', 'great', 'man', 'was', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'fail', 'validate', 'feelings', 'come', 'thoughtless', 'seemingly', 'lazy', 'structure', 'tone', 'not', 'something', 'expected', 'John', 'Ford', 'understand', 'not', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'president', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'little', 'known', 'lawyer', 'real', 'depth', 'may', 'balk', 'statement', 'claim', 'depth', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'films', 'subtle', 'tones', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'subtle', 'film', 'intention', 'sleeves', 'Sure', 'obvious', 'lack', 'manipulated', 'drama', 'here', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'subtle', 'just', 'stagy', 'way', 'Lincoln', 'destiny', 'lackluster', 'way', 'court', 'proceedings', 'are', 'carried', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'lack', 'believability', 'what', 'ridiculous', 'outcries', 'unbelievable', 'testimonies', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'up', 'short', 'almost', 'everywhere.And', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'performances.Henry', 'Fonda', 'fact', 'whole', 'Fonda', 'clan', 'hit', 'miss', 'Henry', 'play', 'variation', 'same', 'character', 'lot', 'what', 'take', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'less', 'poignant', 'version', 'Peck', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'know', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'was', 'made', 'AFTER', 'film', 'just', 'comparison', 'harrowing', 'physical', 'presence', 'role', 'performance', 'lacks', 'real', 'notability', 'kind', 'disappears', 'scenes', 'meandering', 'own', 'mind', 'delivering', 'lines', 'way', 'Fonda', 'not', 'Lincoln', 'felt', 'Alice', 'Brady', 'was', 'never-ending', 'clich', 'eacute', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'manage', 'break', 'constraints', 'script', 'fact', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'speaking', 'role', 'fits', 'bill', 'me.And', 'yet', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'are', 'most', 'John', 'Ford', 'films.Lincoln', 'man', 'was', 'very', 'intriguing', 'poignant', 'figure', 'American', 'history', 'so', 'was', 'disheartened', 'find', 'film', 'lacking', 'real', 'gusto', 'really', 'hope', 'Spielberg', 'Lincoln', 'biopic', 'ground', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'come', 'down', 'retrieve', 'Oscar', '.Alas', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'dud', 'film', 'regardless', 'general', 'consensus', 'film', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'review', 'just', 'was', 'made', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'profound', 'director', 'staring', 'respected', 'actor', 'not', 'mean', 'reproach', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'approach', 'films', 'thus', 'reviews', 'air', 'objectiveness', 'hope', 'can', 'read', 'review', 'same', 'courtesy']",N/A
948521,A2XKQHB8VCUCJK,B000BR6QIM,B. Adducchio,"[0, 0]","My problem with &#34;Young Mr. Lincoln&#34; is that the courtroom scenes, while being tense, are completely out of touch with realism. Never would a lawyer be allowed to ask questions of a witness while the witness was being cross-examined by the opposing counsel. Never would a witness be badgered with questions after the person has left the stand. And never would an argument based on an entry in the Farmer's Almanac be able to prove a case.However, the movie does have some appealing characteristics. For one, it features a superb performance by Henry Fonda as Abe Lincoln. The production design is also very beautiful, as Ford contrasts the dark shadow of Lincoln against the mystical water...see the Criterion cover art as an example of this. There's also some really good drama going on, within the narrative.

948522,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000BR6QIM,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[40, 41]","1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in Hollywood history, with more classic films released than in any other, and John Ford directed three of the best, ""Stagecoach"", ""Drums Along the Mohawk"", and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the Union, ""Young Mr. Lincoln"".With the world plunging into a war that America dreaded, but knew it would be drawn into, Abraham Lincoln was much on people's minds, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life, and had triumphed. On Broadway, Robert E. Sherwood's award-winning ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"", with Raymond Massey's physically dead-on portrayal, was playing to packed houses (it would be filmed in 1940). Carl Sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, ""Abraham Lincoln: The War Years"", was published, and quickly became a best seller. President Roosevelt frequently referred to Lincoln in speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C., became the most popular landmark in town (a fact that Frank Capra made good use of, in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"").All this was not lost on Darryl F. Zanuck, at 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read Lamar Trotti's screenplay of Lincoln's early days as a lawyer, he designated it a 'prestige' production, and assigned John Ford to direct, and Henry Fonda, to star.Fonda did NOT want to play Lincoln; he felt he couldn't do justice to the 'Great Emancipator', and feared a bad performance would damage his career. Even a filmed make-up test, in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble Lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, whom he'd never worked with, cussed him out royally, at their first meeting, and explained he wasn't portraying the Lincoln of Legend, but a young ""jackanape"" country lawyer facing his first murder trial. Humbled, Fonda took the role. (John Ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same!) Obviously, they found a chemistry together that worked, as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics'.Unlike the introverted, melancholia-racked Lincoln of ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"", Ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney, who made friends easily, and misses the mother he lost, too young (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story). Injustice riles him, and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence, interlaced with doses of humor. Both productions play on Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; in Ford's version, the pair are truly in love, and committed to each other. After her death, Lincoln would frequently visit her grave, to share his life with her 'spirit' (a theme Ford would continue in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"").A murder trial is the centerpiece of the film, and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. Fonda deftly portrays Lincoln's inexperience, yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy, and Ford emphasizes the gulf between the big-city 'intellectuals' (represented by pompous D.A. Donald Meek, and his slick 'advisor', Stephen Douglas, played by a young Milburn Stone), and the informal, rule-bending country sense of Lincoln. With Ford 'regular' Ward Bond as a key witness, the trial is both unconventional, and riveting.With the film closing as Lincoln strides away into the stormy distance, and his destiny (dissolving into a view of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial), audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just, good would ultimately triumph.""Young Mr. Lincoln"" is a truly remarkable film, from an amazing year!",5,Young Lincoln Gets the 'Ford' Treatment!,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,3658,"['1939', 'universally', 'accepted', 'greatest', 'year', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'more', 'classic', 'films', 'released', 'other', 'John', 'Ford', 'directed', 'three', 'best', 'Stagecoach', 'Drums', 'Mohawk', 'beautiful', 'homage', 'frontier', 'days', 'young', 'backwoods', 'lawyer', 'destined', 'eventually', 'save', 'Union', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', '.With', 'world', 'plunging', 'war', 'America', 'dreaded', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'much', 'people', 'minds', '1939', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'faced', 'same', 'dilemma', 'own', 'life', 'had', 'triumphed', 'Broadway', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Sherwood', 'award-winning', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Illinois', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'physically', 'dead-on', 'portrayal', 'was', 'playing', 'packed', 'houses', 'would', 'be', 'filmed', '1940', 'Carl', 'Sandburg', 'continuation', 'epic', 'biography', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'War', 'Years', 'was', 'published', 'quickly', 'became', 'best', 'seller', 'President', 'Roosevelt', 'frequently', 'referred', 'Lincoln', 'speeches', 'Lincoln', 'Memorial', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'became', 'most', 'popular', 'landmark', 'town', 'fact', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'made', 'good', 'use', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'was', 'not', 'lost', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'as', 'soon', 'read', 'Lamar', 'Trotti', 'screenplay', 'Lincoln', 'early', 'days', 'lawyer', 'designated', ""'prestige"", 'production', 'assigned', 'John', 'Ford', 'direct', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'star.Fonda', 'did', 'NOT', 'want', 'play', 'Lincoln', 'felt', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', ""'Great"", 'Emancipator', 'feared', 'bad', 'performance', 'would', 'damage', 'career', 'Even', 'filmed', 'make-up', 'test', 'was', 'stunned', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'resemble', 'Lincoln', 'would', ""n't"", 'change', 'mind', 'According', 'Fonda', 'John', 'Ford', 'whom', ""'d"", 'never', 'worked', 'cussed', 'out', 'royally', 'first', 'meeting', 'explained', 'was', ""n't"", 'portraying', 'Lincoln', 'Legend', 'young', 'jackanape', 'country', 'lawyer', 'facing', 'first', 'murder', 'trial', 'Humbled', 'Fonda', 'took', 'role', 'John', 'Ford', 'offered', 'different', 'scenario', 'events', 'outcome', 'was', 'same', 'Obviously', 'found', 'chemistry', 'together', 'worked', 'nearly', 'pairings', 'would', 'produce', 'introverted', 'melancholia-racked', 'Lincoln', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Illinois', 'Ford', 'vision', 'was', 'shy', 'likable', 'young', 'attorney', 'who', 'made', 'friends', 'easily', 'mother', 'lost', 'too', 'young', 'resulting', 'bond', 'pioneer', 'mother', 'vital', 'part', 'story', 'Injustice', ""'common"", 'sense', 'quell', 'violence', 'interlaced', 'doses', 'humor', 'productions', 'play', 'Lincoln', 'undocumented', 'relationship', 'Ann', 'Rutledge', 'Ford', 'version', 'pair', 'are', 'truly', 'love', 'committed', 'other', 'death', 'Lincoln', 'would', 'frequently', 'visit', 'grave', 'share', 'life', ""'spirit"", 'theme', 'Ford', 'would', 'continue', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', '.A', 'murder', 'trial', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'prodigious', 'talents', 'star', 'director', 'Fonda', 'deftly', 'Lincoln', 'inexperience', 'yet', 'earnest', 'belief', 'justice', 'tempered', 'mercy', 'Ford', 'gulf', 'big-city', ""'intellectuals"", 'represented', 'pompous', 'D.A', 'Donald', 'Meek', 'slick', ""'advisor"", 'Stephen', 'Douglas', 'played', 'young', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'informal', 'rule-bending', 'country', 'sense', 'Lincoln', 'Ford', ""'regular"", 'Ward', 'Bond', 'key', 'witness', 'trial', 'unconventional', 'riveting.With', 'film', 'closing', 'Lincoln', 'away', 'stormy', 'distance', 'destiny', 'dissolving', 'view', 'statue', 'Lincoln', 'Memorial', 'audiences', 'could', 'take', 'comfort', 'film', 'message', 'cause', 'just', 'good', 'would', 'ultimately', 'triumph', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'film', 'amazing', 'year']",N/A
948523,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000BR6QIM,Buenoslibros.es,"[1, 4]","It is not one of Ford's best films, but it's a beautiful masterpiece nonetheless. That tells you how much better Ford was to any other director on this planet. About that time he also did 'Tobacco Road', which I like even better, and it's about country folk too. The interest of this story is obviously centered in one character, Lincoln, played by Henry ford. So you notice that to build up that first ingredient into a fully fledged movie is going to be a challenge. Well, Ford succeeds wonderfully. We get to love his characters, even the mean type, the murderer in the story gets some pity from us. That's how wonderful Ford was, he hated sin but not the sinner. The story is all about young man Lincoln at the time he decides to take up law, and his first steps in this business, which get him into a case. The case, a murder, takes three quarters of the film, and the success of Ford was that he lifted the story -dignifying it- even above the main character, Lincoln; he made the story shine by itself, gloriously, so Lincoln works around the story and its other characters and not the other way round. The folk are treated respectfully, as I said, which doesn't mean there's no humor, of course there is, and plenty. As much as there is tenderness, love, family ties, friendship... It's a cocktail of emotions. Ford is about humanity, which includes the bad and the good within it, one cannot be blamed without blaming the other, as they are both part of the same human heart. Ford just encourages us to realize this inner battle, to discern what is good from what is evil within us. Ford is not like the rich city dweller teaching country folk how to be civic and liberal; he is one of us, no better and no worse. Like Jesus, he doesn't throw the first stone either. So why should anybody else?I love Ford's films. They are so rich in humanity, so unpretentious, so close to the real people, the working people, to the humble. His films are so often called poetic because simply no one can show hope, love, tenderness, friendship, loyalty, honor, courage, mercy and kindness better than him. He is no Pharisee, Ford.Take the scene of the lynching for instance. Is Ford spiteful of the wild crowd? In that scene I saw myself portrayed as one of the crowd, just as Ford meant it to be. Only Lincoln stands up to the occasion and brings the mirror to our faces. Any one who would consider himself better than any in the lynching crowd is worse than the murder in the story himself, that's my consideration. Because his pride and self-righteousness will never let him see his own sin and repent.The second disc has some interesting things. I'll just mention the interview made by the British to Henry Fonda -I think it was in the 1980's. It was both sad and illustrative to see and hear Mr Fonda talk about himself and how he got into the movie business. When he talked about a lynching crowd he once witnessed, he let out his hatred and despising for those people, the '[........]', he called them. If not hatred, at least his despising was noticeable when referring to the majority of voters in Nebraska who still vote Republican. I continued listening, though already disappointed by the self-righteousness of this unchristian preacher talk, when he revealed another gem of his characterization: his aversion for horses, riding, guns, and all things country-like. Oh, boy! I'd exchange my European passport for his 'execrable' American one w/o blinking. As Jim Goad says in his 'Redneck Manifesto': ""The 'nice' kids with nice teeth from the nice side of town, have no solid explanation for white trash's existence beyond the purely behavioral. They just shake their heads ... wondering how anyone could act that way.""Both sentiments of sympathy for the great actor and of pity for the man's soul mingled in my heart. If there is one thing I can't cope with is self-righteousness and loftiness. Why is it so hard for some people to put themselves in the skin of others? And why is it so easy to judge those whose circumstances you have never known, nor cared to?  Jesus called this type of people hypocrites. Perhaps Fonda thinks he's better than Jesus too.",5,"The star is the People, not Lincoln.

The film is a black-and-white picture postcard to look at, with immaculate framing and carefully selected imagery to extend the visual idea of early America. It's also a remarkable example of Hollywood myth-making, laying on with a trowel the nobility, natural shrewdness, sensitivity and common-man origins of the man who became a myth. Plus it brings out all the John Ford sympathies for the honesty and goodness of hard-workin' folks. I found myself unmoved by the reverential attitude of the movie; I felt a hymn was always playing in the background, and, sure enough, a hymn, or something close enough, starts playing at the end. With all the research and excellent books about Lincoln around nowadays, with all that we've come to learn about the man, I can't help but think that Lincoln would be smiling if he saw this film.Yet, it's effective as all get out in portraying a myth we want to believe about American life on the frontier and of the man who became our greatest president. There's not a scene in the movie where Ford doesn't fail to effectively stress a simple emotion, like love, humor, longing, honesty and doubt. He cleverly demonstrates in many scenes, particularly in the courtroom, Lincoln's shrewdness. Lincoln consistently outwits others, whether in a tug-o-war, with a man's name, selecting a juror, facing down a mob or trapping a murderer. He might use a request to sample some turnip greens because he's hungry, but he really wants a reason to ask a woman in private to tell him a secret she cannot say in front of others.Henry Fonda, even with a false nose, gives a myth-making performance, himself. Lincoln's homespun nobility is emphasized by Ford with such an unrelenting consistency that I think only Fonda's innate likeabilty and skill make it interesting. Lincoln's ambition and ability to move a crowd his way are only alluded to, but Fonda shows us (and so does Ford) that there was iron in Lincoln's soul.The movie is a beauty to look at. I don't know how many times we see someone, especially Lincoln, on a hill posed against a cloudy sky, with a tree framing the shot, but it works every time. The lengthy vignettes in the first half of the movie showing us the down-to-earth delights of the Fourth of July celebration -- the tug-o-war, the pie contest -- is pure corn, pure John Ford, and still purely effective in making us think there might really have been a time like this -- just like this -- in our history. Who knows, I'm sure there was.The Criterion presentation is excellent. Included in the case is a 27-page booklet with essays on Lincoln and Ford. The extras on the second disc contain, among other items, a profile on Ford and a lengthy interview with Fonda.I watched this movie on the Fourth of July, and was reminded that 180 years ago, also on the Fourth, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died...on the fiftieth anniversary of their signing the Declaration of Independence.",4,"John Ford myth-making about a young Illinois lawyer, but effective and beautiful to look at",1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,2977,"['one', 'level', 'liked', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'lot', 'film', 'black-and-white', 'picture', 'postcard', 'look', 'immaculate', 'framing', 'carefully', 'selected', 'imagery', 'extend', 'visual', 'idea', 'early', 'America', 'also', 'remarkable', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'myth-making', 'laying', 'trowel', 'nobility', 'natural', 'shrewdness', 'sensitivity', 'common-man', 'origins', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'myth', 'out', 'John', 'Ford', 'honesty', 'goodness', 'hard-workin', 'folks', 'found', 'unmoved', 'reverential', 'attitude', 'movie', 'felt', 'hymn', 'was', 'always', 'playing', 'background', 'sure', 'enough', 'hymn', 'something', 'close', 'enough', 'playing', 'end', 'research', 'excellent', 'books', 'Lincoln', 'nowadays', ""'ve"", 'come', 'learn', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Lincoln', 'would', 'be', 'smiling', 'saw', 'film.Yet', 'effective', 'get', 'out', 'portraying', 'myth', 'want', 'believe', 'American', 'life', 'frontier', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'greatest', 'president', 'not', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'Ford', ""n't"", 'fail', 'effectively', 'stress', 'simple', 'emotion', 'love', 'humor', 'longing', 'honesty', 'doubt', 'cleverly', 'many', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'courtroom', 'Lincoln', 'shrewdness', 'Lincoln', 'consistently', 'others', 'tug-o-war', 'man', 'name', 'selecting', 'juror', 'facing', 'down', 'mob', 'trapping', 'murderer', 'might', 'use', 'request', 'sample', 'turnip', 'greens', 'hungry', 'really', 'reason', 'ask', 'woman', 'private', 'tell', 'secret', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'front', 'others.Henry', 'Fonda', 'even', 'false', 'nose', 'myth-making', 'performance', 'Lincoln', 'homespun', 'nobility', 'emphasized', 'Ford', 'such', 'unrelenting', 'consistency', 'think', 'only', 'Fonda', 'innate', 'likeabilty', 'skill', 'make', 'interesting', 'Lincoln', 'ambition', 'ability', 'move', 'crowd', 'way', 'are', 'only', 'alluded', 'Fonda', 'so', 'Ford', 'was', 'iron', 'Lincoln', 'soul.The', 'movie', 'beauty', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'someone', 'especially', 'Lincoln', 'hill', 'posed', 'cloudy', 'sky', 'tree', 'framing', 'shot', 'time', 'lengthy', 'vignettes', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'showing', 'down-to-earth', 'delights', 'Fourth', 'July', 'celebration', 'tug-o-war', 'pie', 'contest', 'pure', 'corn', 'pure', 'John', 'Ford', 'still', 'purely', 'effective', 'making', 'think', 'might', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'time', 'just', 'history', 'Who', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was.The', 'Criterion', 'presentation', 'excellent', 'Included', 'case', '27-page', 'booklet', 'essays', 'Lincoln', 'Ford', 'extras', 'second', 'disc', 'contain', 'other', 'items', 'profile', 'Ford', 'lengthy', 'interview', 'Fonda.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'Fourth', 'July', 'was', 'reminded', '180', 'years', 'ago', 'also', 'Fourth', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'John', 'Adams', 'died', 'fiftieth', 'anniversary', 'signing', 'Declaration', 'Independence']",N/A

948528,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BR6QIM,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Long on mythology and short on actual historical facts, John Ford's seminal 1939 film about Abraham Lincoln's early days is made singularly memorable by Henry Fonda's sterling performance in the eponymous role. With a prosthetic nose, lanky build, and his voice in measured tones, the actor manages to capture with palpable sincerity and conviction the future President's endless curiosity had as a young man about life and the law in 1830's Illinois. He evokes a folksy, self-deprecating persona befitting of Lincoln, and screenwriter Lamar Trotti's anecdotal portrait humanizes the man behind the performance by emphasizing the life-size qualities that served him later - his deep humility and self-effacing manner; his conviction in helping those who could not help themselves, and more broadly, his gift for reconciling warring factions despite the odds.The film is deceptively modest in scope, as the story only covers Lincoln from the time he begins to consider studying law to his first major court case. Where the film feels somewhat less than a masterpiece is in its pacing, which fluctuates between elegiac and lethargic. I'm sure it was intentional on Ford's part to take his time in establishing the rural atmosphere and tracking Lincoln's growth toward iconic status. Sometimes, the approach works wonderfully well as in the early scene when an obviously smitten Lincoln tentatively chats with Ann Rutledge, an unrealized romance due to her early unexpected death. Ford has the actors express their mutual yearning beautifully in the scene and then follows it seamlessly with a sad wintry scene when Lincoln speaks to her grave. On the other hand, other scenes go on far too long such as the Independence Day celebration sequence and the courtship with Mary Todd. The overall effect can get wearing.However, the momentum picks up with the court case, which has Lincoln defending two brothers charged with murder leading to a strong jailhouse speech from Lincoln and a courtroom climax that portends the whodunit cases of future TV series.  Aside from Fonda's stellar work, Alice Brady impressively switches gears from her usual gadabout roles and plays the frontier mother Abigail Clay with poignancy. Others like Ward Bond and Donald Meek play their archetypical Ford roles with customary ease. The two-disc 2006 Criterion Collection DVD is rich with extras as is standard with their packages. The first disc offers an excellent print transfer of the film, but unfortunately no commentary track from a film scholar. Two archival video pieces are included on the second disc. Directed and hosted by filmmaker Lindsay Anderson, the first is an illuminating 1992 BBC portrait of Ford, ""Omnibus: John Ford, Part One"", which covers the filmmaker's career until WWII.The second video is a 1975 interview that longtime British talk show host Michael Parkinson conducted with a seventy-year old Fonda. The actor talks candidly about his career, including his fortuitous casting in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", as well as a traumatic childhood experience where he witnessed a lynching. Perhaps most surprising and touching is what seems to be his genuine pride over the accomplishments of his children Jane and Peter. There are a few audio-only extras - a thirty-minute condensed radio broadcast of the movie that was originally broadcast in 1946 with Fonda and Bond repeating their roles, as well as two brief interviews with Ford and Fonda conducted by Ford's grandson Dan.

Though 1939 is a bit far back even for me, this film is a thread in the tapestry of my cinematic life. Silly, dated and a bit at cross-purposes when it comes to realism, I dearly love it all.Covering a brief period in Lincoln's life when he was a settled defense attorney in Springfield, Illinois (think circa 1858), this courtroom drama is based on the true story of Lincoln defending an innocent young man accused of a brutal murder. The way he leads his witnesses, makes the courtroom laugh (don't miss the scene when the judge finally gets one of Lincoln's jokes), all the while working out how he's going to nail the real culprit - all classic film. Classic Ford.Naturally it comes with a share of silliness to be expected from this ""cinemantebellum"" period (MY term, don't steal it). Silly choral musical interludes, exaggerated shots that would have made Buster Keaton wince himself into a pretzel, well, it is John Ford and that is what Ford did. Also, you will see a young Ward Bond here - another 'thing' Ford always did, thank heavens. Bond is as powerful here as always.The dazzling portrayal by Henry Fonda will remind you of the slick, hipster portrayal Sam Waterston gave in TV'sGore Vidal's Lincolnthough Fonda surpasses all other portrayals I have ever seen. I often decry the lack of a sequel starring Fonda, directed by Ford. Perhaps it was cold feet that stopped any thought of a sequel: Fonda almost didn't play Lincoln, thinking himself unworthy. Ford insisted on a full make-up screen test/reading. Fonda was sold when he watched it in playback.Ford and Darryl F. Zanuck even fought over this; Ford had destroyed outtakes so the studio couldn't re-insert them. Among these is a scene in which Lincoln meets a very young John Wilkes Booth. In spite of it all, because of it all, this is a fantastic, funny, sweet and awe-inspiring film. No one, I don't care what age, should miss this.In a way, it is John Ford at his very best.

Sure, it's a film filled with a lot of fluff and partial truths, and downright lies, as far as what went on in the film. It didn't bother me when I first watched it when I was a kid, and it sure doesn't bother me today. Matter of fact, sometimes I just want a good old taste of Fonda-as-Lincoln. It's the only really neat Lincoln portrayal that I know. Isn't it good that Henry Fonda chose to do the part? Because today, we also have his ""Lincoln Portrait,"" that he narrated along with Aaron Copland's music performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.I have this two-disc set and love how Criterion shares the love with these classics. The first disc is only the film and it looks like a gorgeous digital transfer. The second disc has some audio recordings and clips from TV dealing with Ford and Fonda. They add insight into how the film was made.My goodness, with Ford and Fonda coming up with this classic, it's just fun to watch. John Ford didn't make this as a docudrama. He - as well as Fonda - were entertainers, and Ford had a great imagination. Ford's motivation was a paycheck (as he said, himself in the supplemental disc, about directing Young Mr Lincoln). Most of Ford's classics aren't at all about getting the facts straight, as much as making the most entertainment for the characters he was putting on screen. Did *any* of John Ford's films about real people or events actually follow what happened in real life, or the novels that the movies were based on?Prisoner of Shark Island (1936)? Mainly inaccurate portrayal of Dr Mudd, banished to an island for treating John Wilkes Booth after he shot President Lincoln.Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)? Ford used plenty of artistic license, veering from the novel in many respects.The Long Voyage Home (1940)? The novel was written around World War I, but Ford set it for WWII.Some people just seem to want to scratch at something like it's a day-old mosquito bite. It's been there but they're still bothered with it so much that they want to dig at it 'til it's raw. Young Mr Lincoln's been there since 1939 and it's gaining popularity. It was nominated for an Academy Award, for a fictionalized account of Abe Lincoln's years in Illinois. It's not perfect but it's the perfect type of film to watch when you just wanna kick back to an old film that isn't heavy on plot.

948533,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000BR6QIM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 5]","The ghost of 1939 cinema strikes again. Rumor has it that Henry Fonda wanted no truck of playing Abraham Lincoln, finding the role too intimidating. That is, until John Ford, legendary director and irascible martinet, called him out, and so was launched the first of their eight collaborations. Nowadays, whenever debate surfaces regarding Ford's very best works, odds are YOUNG MR. LINCOLN is slighted. And, no, I won't argue that THE SEARCHERS and THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE aren't the superior films. But YOUNG MR. LINCOLN counts as superb cinema, Fonda's just right performance meshing perfectly with John Ford's vision. Ford has always had that knack for establishing place and atmosphere, for capturing that evocative feel of Americana. This leisurely paced historical drama finds actor and director on the same page.The film opens in 1832, New Salem, Illinois, as it introduces and then dispenses with a character who, nevertheless, would determine the course of Abe Lincoln's life. We note Abe's conversation by the river with the lovely Ann Rutledge. We follow the polite dialogue and sense the things left unsaid between them. The camera then shifts to some time later, to a wintry landscape marked by Ann Rutledge's gravestone and a mournful Abe Lincoln. Right there, with his beloved Ann in mind, he chooses a path. He takes his book learnin' and goes about becoming a lawyer. He always had a way with words.Predominantly, YOUNG MR. LINCOLN centers around the highly fictionalized account of Abe as a novice attorney in Springfield, Illinois, defending two brothers accused of murder. Except that the wistful memory of Ann Rutledge towers over the narrative. It's what pushes Abe, colors his demeanor; it makes him pensive whenever he gazes out at the river. Poor Mary Todd never really had a chance. Henry Fonda infuses his character with remarkable sensitivity and a deep melancholy. But he also portrays Abe as homespun wise and witty, entirely the self-deprecating man that he must've been, with an easy way about him. Fonda's tall, lanky frame suits the role, ably abetted by elegant proboscis work provided by the make-up department. John Ford plants the future president firmly in his element, surrounds him with like-minded characters and embeds him in backdrops that are pitch perfect and evocative of his era.And so what if the story mythologizes the man? John Ford may be a tyrant behind the camera but he is also unabashedly sentimental. YOUNG MR. LINCOLN is deeply moving, often humorous, sometimes rousing. It serves as a coming-of-age story, featuring Abe in the early stages of greatness. We see him face down a frenzied lynch mob. In the film's second half, which is essentially an extended courtroom sequence, Abe exercises his wits and goes about humorously dissecting the prosecutor's witnesses. It may or may not be a subtle thing, but we see Abe influence the proceedings just by the casual positioning of that towering, gangly frame of his. It certainly throws the prosecutor (a pompous Donald Meek) off his game. And, alright, while it's not exactly a hallmark of greatness, we even see him triumph in a log splitting competition and cheat his way to victory in a tug-of-war contest. The film ends before Abe seriously dips his toe in politics, and so we're spared (or we miss out on) the momentous events in which a humble self-taught man, this greatest president, finds his mettle truly tested.This Criterion Collection presentation of YOUNG MR. LINCOLN comes in two discs, plus a 28-page booklet featuring an essay by critic Geoffrey O'Brien and an homage to Ford by Russian director Sergei Eisenstein. Disc 1 has the feature presentation in a new, restored high-definition digital transer, with optional English sub-titles for the deaf and hearing impaired. Disc 2 contains the following supplement features:- Television profile of John Ford's early career presented on the BBC arts program, Omnibus, which aired on December 1, 1992 (00:42:16 minutes)- Episode from the BBC talk show, Parkinson, featuring an interview with a surprisingly droll Henry Fonda that aired on November 1, 1975; Fonda reflects on his career and his collaborations with John Ford; he also tells several fun anecdotes, the best of which revolve around Jimmy Stewart and Sergio Leone (00:49:02 minutes)- Archival audio interviews with Ford and Fonda, conducted by the filmmaker's grandson Dan Ford who, at the time, was doing research for his book PAPPY: THE LIFE OF JOHN FORD- Academy Award Theater radio dramatization of YOUNG MR.

Each shot recalls a vintage American painting and the images are complimented by a fine ensemble and strong emotional music score.Henry Fonda gives one of the best performances of his career in the definitive interpretation of the great American as a young man. Made up to resemble his classic portraits more, Fonda indeed becomes the part and embues the role with equal doses of sympathy, humor and nobility.His scene where he contemplates his future over the grave of his deceased love is about as good as it gets.The plot is focused mainly as Lincoln's rise as a lawyer and his early political beliefs. He becomes the lawyer for a poor family whose two sons have been accused of a murder.Fascinating filmmaking with some of the most exquisite shots ever captured on film and fine performances.

948535,AYA9ZUS9Z0BVW,B000BR6QIM,"Jane Pensive ""a film fan""","[19, 24]","I recently viewed this film for the first time. As a fan of director John Ford, I was looking forward to watching his take on Lincoln, who is  arguably one of the greatest men who ever lived. I have read many biographies of the great emancipator, and was frankly shocked at the utter lack of historical accuracy of the  film. Lincoln's story is compelling, unique, inspiring, and exciting. Why make stuff up? Unbelievably the film bears the stamp of a prestige 20th Century Fox production.Every Ford film has some corny humor in it, even his most  magnificent efforts (Fort Apache, The Searchers, Rio Grande, etc). Here Ford (and I think it is Ford and not screenwriter Trotti, although it may have been Darryl F Zanuck's poor judgment, as very few scripts at 20th Century Fox were put in production without his edits) sometimes depicts Lincoln as a standup comic.  It is undeniable that  Lincoln had a great sense of humor and was capable of hilarious comments and homilies. However they were delivered with charm, humility and gentleness. This is not the way Lincoln cracks wise in this film.Any student of Lincoln can spot all of the nonsense contained in the plot, but by far, the most offensive fallacies are contained in the courtroom scenes. It appears that the murder trial is inspired by one of Lincoln' cases in which he defended a young man of murder charges and was able to  gain an acquittal by having the court take judicial notice of the Farmer's Almanac, which directly contradicted eyewitness testimony based on the witness' assertion that he could see the murder by moonlight, when none was available on the date and time according to the Almanac. Every law student knows this cross examination, in which Lincoln painstakingly set up the  prosecution witness, knowing he would tear down the testimony with the Almanac. It is taught in every evidence course in the country as a graphic example of the use of judicial notice. In Ford's film, Lincoln clumsily stumbles on the key to impeaching the eyewitness and then engages in a Perry Mason style accusation of said witness. It is really cringeworthy. The manner in which the courtroom players interact is also outrageous. The courtroom watchers, lawyers, and witnesses move about wherever they want, speak out whenever they want, and engage in shenanigans which I doubt any judge in Illinois would brook, even in the mid 1800's. Lincoln was a successful and shrewd attorney (one of his clients was the railroad, which he could bill  by the hour for his work). His style may have been countrified, but he was not the buffoon made out here.Fonda does his  very best to find Lincoln's great character and humble dignity amidst all of this silliness. His performance certainly held my interest, although Ford does make him do embarrassing things like play the jew's harp in his law office, with his feet hanging out of the window. Ford also can't resist having Lincoln point out that an opposing witness' name, when said quickly, sounds like ""jackass."" Very amusing. It is a testament to Fonda's talent that I could finish viewing this ""picture,"" as Ford called his films, without running for cover. Every student of Ford's should watch this movie. It is worth viewing to see how misguided a great talent can be on occasion.",2,"Torn - I hate to critcize one of my idols, but...",1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,3288,"['recently', 'viewed', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'fan', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'take', 'Lincoln', 'who', 'arguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'men', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'biographies', 'great', 'emancipator', 'was', 'frankly', 'shocked', 'utter', 'lack', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'story', 'compelling', 'unique', 'inspiring', 'exciting', 'Why', 'make', 'stuff', 'up', 'Unbelievably', 'film', 'stamp', 'prestige', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'production.Every', 'Ford', 'film', 'corny', 'humor', 'even', 'most', 'magnificent', 'efforts', 'Fort', 'Apache', 'Searchers', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'etc', 'Here', 'Ford', 'think', 'Ford', 'not', 'screenwriter', 'Trotti', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Darryl', 'F', 'Zanuck', 'poor', 'judgment', 'very', 'few', 'scripts', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'were', 'put', 'production', 'edits', 'sometimes', 'Lincoln', 'standup', 'comic', 'undeniable', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'capable', 'hilarious', 'comments', 'homilies', 'However', 'were', 'delivered', 'charm', 'humility', 'gentleness', 'not', 'way', 'Lincoln', 'wise', 'film.Any', 'student', 'Lincoln', 'can', 'spot', 'nonsense', 'contained', 'plot', 'far', 'most', 'offensive', 'fallacies', 'are', 'contained', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'murder', 'trial', 'inspired', 'one', 'Lincoln', 'cases', 'defended', 'young', 'man', 'murder', 'charges', 'was', 'able', 'gain', 'acquittal', 'having', 'court', 'take', 'judicial', 'notice', 'Farmer', 'Almanac', 'directly', 'contradicted', 'eyewitness', 'testimony', 'based', 'witness', 'assertion', 'could', 'see', 'murder', 'moonlight', 'when', 'none', 'was', 'available', 'date', 'time', 'according', 'Almanac', 'Every', 'law', 'student', 'cross', 'examination', 'Lincoln', 'painstakingly', 'set', 'up', 'prosecution', 'witness', 'knowing', 'would', 'tear', 'down', 'testimony', 'Almanac', 'taught', 'evidence', 'course', 'country', 'graphic', 'example', 'use', 'judicial', 'notice', 'Ford', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'clumsily', 'key', 'impeaching', 'eyewitness', 'then', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'style', 'accusation', 'said', 'witness', 'really', 'cringeworthy', 'manner', 'courtroom', 'players', 'interact', 'also', 'outrageous', 'courtroom', 'watchers', 'lawyers', 'witnesses', 'move', 'wherever', 'want', 'speak', 'out', 'whenever', 'want', 'engage', 'shenanigans', 'doubt', 'judge', 'Illinois', 'would', 'brook', 'even', 'mid', '1800', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'successful', 'shrewd', 'attorney', 'one', 'clients', 'was', 'railroad', 'could', 'bill', 'hour', 'work', 'style', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'countrified', 'was', 'not', 'buffoon', 'made', 'out', 'here.Fonda', 'very', 'best', 'find', 'Lincoln', 'great', 'character', 'humble', 'dignity', 'silliness', 'performance', 'certainly', 'held', 'interest', 'Ford', 'make', 'do', 'embarrassing', 'things', 'play', 'jew', 'harp', 'law', 'office', 'feet', 'hanging', 'window', 'Ford', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'having', 'Lincoln', 'point', 'out', 'opposing', 'witness', 'name', 'when', 'said', 'quickly', 'jackass', 'Very', 'amusing', 'testament', 'Fonda', 'talent', 'could', 'finish', 'viewing', 'picture', 'Ford', 'called', 'films', 'running', 'cover', 'student', 'Ford', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'worth', 'viewing', 'see', 'how', 'misguided', 'great', 'talent', 'can', 'be', 'occasion']",N/A

If they can't relate, perhaps the best we can hope for in modern film will be decent literary adaptations.The film depicts a small slice of Lincoln's early life, his work as a young lawyer in Springfield, Illinois.  The film cannot be taken as accurate history of Lincoln's life.  Rather it presents an imaginative rendition of how a young Lincoln might have acted given his character, intelligence and homespun origins.  The centerpiece of the film is Lincoln's brilliant defense of two brothers accused of murder.  While the murder case, is the main plot, there are numerous other vignettes that include humor, romance, frontier life, and touches of American history, such as the role played by Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's great political rival.  The climactic courtroom scene, in which an isolated and unproven Lincoln ferrets out the startling truth of the case at hand, moves seamlessly from comedy to pathos to riveting and startling intense drama, in which the viewer feels himself as amazed and exhilarated as those present in the scene itself.Henry Fonda plays Lincoln marvelously.

Mr. Lincoln played by Henry Fonda is a simple yet caring man capable of hiding his ambitious desires for natural law and community. Being a novice lawyer in a small minded town is not easy as Mr. Lincoln breaks up infuriated mobbs, and gives every bit of solace and tranquility to those in need. He is not stern or condescending in the least bit as he reaches out to anyone in need of assitance with pure sincerity. Within in each frame of exterior shots of the Ilinois landscape it only  enhances Lincoln's bond with nature as he gazes and reflects onto his favorite river. Abraham Lincoln being long deceased and gone has not at all in any regards disrupted my bond with this great American president. It is as though you are viewing an historical figure that lives in our present time period. Mr. Lincoln even at the most strenous and tense moments (Court Room Scene) is able to contribute a calm and scerene atomsphere with his gleeful relaxed humor. As usual I am ever so grateful to the Criterion Collection for establishing such a presitgious and artful collection because this film derserves every bit of praise and recoginition.

The first several scenes, are simply a series of moments that establish a mood and Lincoln's attitude: he is smart but uneducated, he was in love with a woman who believes in him and whose death motivates him to take up her challenge to ""be somebody"", he is simultaneously introspective and isolated and yet more at home with the ""common people"" than with elites, able to connect by not seeming to take himself all that seriously, he understands the law as a tool for overcoming wrongs and achieving rights rather than an end in itself.  The story itself gets rolling when, after he's established himself as a new lawyer, a couple of country kids get in a fight with a local bully who also happens to be a deputy and accidentally kill him.  His defense of the kids simultaneously illustrates: (1) Lincoln's capacity to appeal to simple intuitions of right and wrong, sometimes through humor and self-deprecation and simple story telling, that spoke to an American populace so far not entirely committed to lawfulness; (2) tied to that theme is the idea that the people's sense of justice was rooted in feeling -- as evidenced by their sense that a lynching performed in outrage would serve justice -- so Lincoln understood that for the people to commit themselves to the law required an appeal to the same level of feeling and intuition that drove them to be more or less neighborly for the most part and to group together in outrage and vengeance on occasion; (3) Lincoln's ambiguous sense of ambition: attracted to a higher life, and yet feeling a bit out of place within it; motivated in part by a desire for fairness, but in part by a longing to be respected and to demonstrate the condescension of the elite and educated to be misplaced.  It is a compelling piece of filmmaking -- illustrative of the American style of mythmaking that aims to show the ""ordinary"" common man behind the legend rather than the legendary origins of a hero.

948553,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,B000BR6QIM,Steven A. Peterson,"[1, 1]","Quite an enjoyable movie.  Directed by John Ford (one of three fine movies from him that year--along with ""Stagecoach"" and ""Drums along the Mohawk""), starring Henry Fonda as Young Mr. Lincoln (and a young Milburn Stone as Stephen Douglas), and Darryl Zanuck producing.  The movie starts with ""The Battle Cry of Freedom.""This is a slow paced elegiac movie, a montage of scenes, not particularly well organized and not laid out in a linear fashion.  But that makes little difference.  The venue for the movie is Sangamon County, Illinois (with Springfield as the center within that venue).  This is not really a linear movie; as noted, it is a set of scenes that define Ford's vision of young Lincoln.  A booklet coming with the DVD is especially interesting.  There is a brief essay by Sergei Eisenstein, the great Russian director, who comments on this movie.  He notes that this is a movie that ""I wish I had made.""  His essay concludes: ""My love for this film has neither cooled nor been forgotten.  It grows stronger and the film itself grows more dear to me.""Among the vignettes depicted in this movie: Lincoln's poignant relationship with Ann Rutledge and his response to her passing; his move to a legal career; his ride along the river; his meeting Mary Todd.  Above all, that wonderful trial episode, one of my all-time favorite movie scenes. Especially moving is his final cross-examination of Jack Cass (the pun generates great mirth among the characters of the movie), played by the redoubtable Ward Bond.Again, what a year for John Ford!  Three fine movies, each, in its own way, a classic.  While there can surely be questions about the historical accuracy of this movie, the feel is right in creating a characterization of young Lincoln.
