354824,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303079709,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Life With Father, 1947 filmThe story begins with a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, an engineering marvel of that era (built while William Marcy Tweed was mayor of New York city). One picture shows a steam water pump pulled by a three-horse team; it provided pressurized water for fighting fires. Other pictures show life in the New York streets. [Note the dirt street of Madison Avenue.] A milkman delivers milk by pouring it into the customer's container. A dumbwaiter brings food from the cellar kitchen to an upper floor. We meet the family. A father's old suit is cut down to fit his oldest son. Why do they have a turnover in maids? ""I know what you'll like or not like."" Household accounts keep track of expenses. Would a charge account be better? Mr. Day complains about taxes, again. Is there a misunderstanding? [Why is he so unaware?]Mrs. Day gets a visit from relatives. Clarence Jr. plays a violin. Clarence Sr. hires another maid. Will he pay $5,000 for a new pew? His old one lost value. Is he cranky? Same words, different tune? The family dines at Delmonicos. Was Clarence Sr. ever baptized? No? The air vents carry the conversation upstairs. The Episcopalian minister talks about the need for Baptism for salvation. We learn about kneeling in church for Episcopalians and Methodists. Clarry and Mary talk on the back porch. Clarry wants a new suit. His father tells him about women. ""Don't let them get you stirred up!"" ""Be firm."" Clarence Sr. wants a high tariff to protect America against cheap foreign labor. [No mention of businesses.] An argument over money? Its for her own good. The two young sons argue over Father's status. Will his comments upset his wife Vinnie again? The boys get a job selling a patent medicine. How good is it? Clarence is summoned from his office, his wife is sick.Whitney studies for his Confirmation. Mrs. Day is seriously ill, the Minister is called. Doctors made house calls then. Will Clarence accept Baptism? Or kneel and pray? After Vinnie recovers she goes shopping. [We see a clothing store from the 1880s.] ""Genuine imitation Dresden."" ""It's not the price, it's the money."" Clarence gave his word to be baptized. ""I didn't pay anything for it, I charged it."" The ceramic dog goes back in exchange for the new suit. ""What have I done now?"" Mrs. Day explains why the suit cost nothing - it was exchanged for the ceramic dog! Those relatives return for another visit. The cab will take them all to the church for Baptism. Or will it?This movie was adapted from a Broadway stage play and a book. It tells you what was popular in the 1940s (the attitudes). Is it still funny and amusing? Not for me. There was a about a minute of speech censored from young Clarence.

354830,A5QZKZTG3ME0M,6303079709,Amazon Customer,"[30, 30]","People...PLEASE understand...this is digitally REMASTERED NOT RESTORED.  Consider yourself fortunate to have a copy even this good when you consider WARNER ENTERTAINMENT has turned their backs on this wonderful old classic.  WARNER ENTERTAINMENT has no interest in ever making this title available from their own original negatives which is so unfortunate.  This title fell into public domain and because of that WARNER apparently feel it has no commercial value.  Under the circumstances we have to just be thankful that any company is at least willing to find a good, clean copy and attempt to remaster it.Please remember the difference.  A RESTORED movie is one that come from the original negative or good working print and every single frame (16 to each minute so some nearly 2,000 frames for the full movie)and clean up dirt, scratches, rips, etc and attempt to restore it to it original beauty. This process is extremely costly.  In fact, in some circumstances restoration can cost as much as the original movie production.  It is just not an expense anyone but a major studio could afford.A REMASTERED movie is when a company can locate a good print and try to clean up that print the best they can.  Because it is a print and not a negative it is nearly impossible to do much better then what we see in LIFE WITH FATHER.  But it is apparent that they did locate a very nice, clean print.  This copy is far superior to any copy previously available to the public.You can't compare this to the TV prints.  Keep in mind that WARNER still holds on to the TV released prints and there they are working with original negatives (the same negatives and prints that WARNER does not wish to release to the general public which is so very upsetting....but then WARNER is the worst studio for turning its backs on the collectors).And disregard the collector who complained about the story content.  This is not a dull, boring story.  It came from what in 1946 was at the time the longest running non musical Broadway play.  It is based on a true life story and is a beautiful example of the life in a much softer life.  We rarely get glimpses of early America in movies today and it is a treasure to be able to view that time in a movie that was produced when people from that era were still alive and able to recreate what to them were memories.

He is bombastic and opinionated. His gruff manner and outspokeness scares off parlormaids with regularity. He runs his family and household with a firm hand. At least, he thinks he does. Underneath all that sound and fury beats a soft heart, and wife Vinnie, played by Irene Dunne, knows just how to handle him when she needs to. Equal amounts of psychology and a brand of illogical logic worthy of Gracie Allen can usually achieve the desired end. Powell and Dunne are wonderful together in the classic comedy set in New York City in the 1880's. He is in control one moment and bewildered the next. She is yielding one moment, giving orders the next. The scene where she explains to him why the $15 jacket for Clarence, Jr. didn't actually cost anything is hilarious.&quot;Life With Father&quot; is another of those classic movies based on a hit Broadway play. The play, in turn, is based on a book by the real Clarence Day, Jr. I read a short story based on the book when I was a school kid. The story had me laughing so much that I never forgot it. I never saw the play, but the film is certainly no letdown. The sets are lush (these people are upper class, hence the household servants) and the supporting cast is very good. In particular, see a young Elizabeth Taylor as an out-of-town visitor who sparks Clarence Jr.'s interest. The humor is based on witty dialogue and funny situations.

He's the son of freethinkers, and although he goes to church (Episcopalian), he has never been baptized. He's a bit of a martinet, but he loves his wife (Irene Dunn) and his four sons: Clarence, Jr., John, Whitney and Harlan. He believes he is master of his household, but his wife manipulates him in a hundred ways.A very young Elizabeth Taylor plays Mary Skinner, a visitor who came with Cousin Cora (Zazu Pitts) and promptly bewitched Clarence, Junior. But young Clarence is wearing a cut-down suit of his father's, and can't seem to make it do anything his father would not do. Like kneel in church, or accept Mary sitting on his lap.Young Clarence and John go to work selling patent medicine, and decide to test it on their mother, who was not feeling well.

Manhattan) shows that there are certain constants about family life even after more than a century.  In 1883 the Day family--stockbroker Clarence Sr. (William Powell), known to most of his intimates as Clare; his wife Vinnie (Irene Dunne); and sons Clarence Jr. (Jimmy Lydon), almost 18, John (Martin Milner), 14, Whitney (Johnny Calkins), 10, and six-year-old Harlan (Derek Scott)--lives a comfortable upper-class life in a brownstone house at 420 Madison Avenue, where ""Father"" definitely rules the roost, or at least tries to.  But the servant problem, a loveably scatterbrained and financially hopeless wife, and four boys with redheaded high spirits make life a lot more difficult than he'd prefer.  When Vinnie's Cousin Cora (Zasu Pitts) and a young friend, 15-year-old Mary Skinner (Elizabeth Taylor), come to visit, a revelation ensues that shocks the devout Vinnie: Clarence has never been baptized!  Will he ever get to Heaven?  Is she really married to him?  Are her sons (horrors!) even legitimate?  Vinnie resolves to get her husband to the font come hell or high water.  Meanwhile young Clarence is suffering the pangs of first love, which he tries to deal with as he thinks his father would (a situation complicated by the inexplicable fact that his new suit, cut down from one of Clarence Sr.'s, seems disinclined to ""do anything that Father wouldn't do,"" including kneel to a girl or let her sit on his lap); John, eager to earn some extra spending money, is given ""the whole territory of Manhattan"" in which to sell a patent medicine that proves a good deal less virtuous than its advertising suggests; Whitney struggles with his catechism, and Harlan with issues like oatmeal (which he hates) and the prospect of being kissed by girls (which is even worse).  Clare and Vinnie don't seem to share a bedroom, yet it's obvious that they love each other dearly and have ever since their marriage 20 years ago; Vinnie is constantly trying to soothe Clare's outbreaks of temper, and Clare, when Vinnie becomes mysteriously ill, is utterly lost without her.  And while the four boys may behave much more formally than youngsters of today, they're still recognizably red-blooded American lads: girls and money interest the older ones, and though he may have to do it in a short-pants sailor suit ornamented with soutache, Whitney is so eager to pitch that he bolts his breakfast shamefully.  At the center of it all is Father, played so masterfully by Powell that he should have been awarded the Oscar (he *was* among the finalists).  This is a great family film, full of humor, unforgettable characters, and talking points.",4,Families haven't really changed all that much in 100+ years,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,2967,"['was', 'Tolstoy', 'who', 'declared', 'happy', 'families', 'are', 'alike', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'terms', 'passage', 'time', 'classic', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'equally', 'classic', 'stage', 'play', 'was', 'adapted', 'very', 'well', 'Clarence', 'Day', 'volume', 'reminiscencesLife', 'Fatherof', 'boyhood', 'late-19th-C.', 'Manhattan', 'are', 'certain', 'constants', 'family', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'century', '1883', 'Day', 'family', 'stockbroker', 'Clarence', 'Sr.', 'William', 'Powell', 'known', 'most', 'intimates', 'Clare', 'wife', 'Vinnie', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'sons', 'Clarence', 'Jr.', 'Jimmy', 'Lydon', 'almost', '18', 'John', 'Martin', 'Milner', '14', 'Whitney', 'Johnny', 'Calkins', '10', 'six-year-old', 'Harlan', 'Derek', 'Scott', 'comfortable', 'upper-class', 'life', 'brownstone', 'house', '420', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'where', 'Father', 'definitely', 'rules', 'roost', 'least', 'tries', 'servant', 'problem', 'loveably', 'scatterbrained', 'financially', 'hopeless', 'wife', 'four', 'boys', 'redheaded', 'high', 'spirits', 'make', 'life', 'lot', 'more', 'difficult', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'When', 'Vinnie', 'Cousin', 'Cora', 'Zasu', 'Pitts', 'young', 'friend', '15-year-old', 'Mary', 'Skinner', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'come', 'visit', 'revelation', 'devout', 'Vinnie', 'Clarence', 'never', 'been', 'baptized', 'Will', 'ever', 'get', 'Heaven', 'really', 'married', 'Are', 'sons', 'horrors', 'even', 'legitimate', 'Vinnie', 'get', 'husband', 'font', 'come', 'hell', 'high', 'water', 'Meanwhile', 'young', 'Clarence', 'suffering', 'pangs', 'first', 'love', 'deal', 'father', 'would', 'situation', 'complicated', 'inexplicable', 'fact', 'new', 'suit', 'cut', 'down', 'one', 'Clarence', 'Sr.', 'disinclined', 'do', 'anything', 'Father', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'including', 'kneel', 'girl', 'let', 'sit', 'lap', 'John', 'eager', 'earn', 'extra', 'spending', 'money', 'given', 'whole', 'territory', 'Manhattan', 'sell', 'patent', 'medicine', 'good', 'deal', 'less', 'virtuous', 'advertising', 'Whitney', 'catechism', 'Harlan', 'issues', 'oatmeal', 'prospect', 'being', 'kissed', 'girls', 'even', 'worse', 'Clare', 'Vinnie', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'share', 'bedroom', 'obvious', 'love', 'other', 'dearly', 'have', 'ever', 'marriage', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Vinnie', 'constantly', 'trying', 'soothe', 'Clare', 'outbreaks', 'temper', 'Clare', 'when', 'Vinnie', 'mysteriously', 'ill', 'utterly', 'lost', 'four', 'boys', 'may', 'behave', 'much', 'more', 'formally', 'youngsters', 'today', ""'re"", 'still', 'recognizably', 'red-blooded', 'American', 'lads', 'girls', 'money', 'interest', 'older', 'ones', 'may', 'have', 'do', 'short-pants', 'sailor', 'suit', 'ornamented', 'soutache', 'Whitney', 'so', 'eager', 'pitch', 'bolts', 'breakfast', 'shamefully', 'center', 'Father', 'played', 'so', 'masterfully', 'Powell', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'awarded', 'Oscar', 'finalists', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'full', 'humor', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'talking', 'points']",Life With Father VHS

Although Irene Dunne has some Gracie Allen-type gag lines, William Powell is the one who provides most of the laughs in this tale of upper-crust family life in the 1880s. However, both Powell and Dunne are excellent and play off each other well.The story revolves around the personal and business life of the Clarence Day family, a true family in the sense of the word it, which is nice to see. Every character is interesting and the supporting cast includes Edmund Gwenn and Zasu Pitts (love that name!). The Technicolor is nice, too. All in all, it's a nice period piece that takes you back life a little over a century ago, and provides us another one of these more-innocent family stories.THE BAD  - The romance between Jimmy Lydon and a young Elizabeth Taylor gets a little sappy. Powell's constant exclamation ""Gad!"" is very annoying as a close as screenwriters apparently could get to saying ""God"" all the time in 1947.THE UGLY - To my knowledge, there has never been a good print made of this, either on tape or DVD, which includes this DVD.

Taylor ""GFT""","[76, 76]","As an adult, Clarence Day Jr. (1874-1935) joined his well-known father on Wall Street--but developed a form of arthritis that left him a semi-invalid.  Shortly before his death he published LIFE WITH FATHER, a humorous memoir of his Victorian childhood; sadly, he did not live to see its great success.  A best seller, the novel was adapted to the stage in 1939 by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse.  Warner Bro.s bought the film rights, agreeing to wait until the show finished its Broadway run; as it happened the studio had a long wait, for the play went on to become one of Broadway's longest running shows, playing almost eight years.In acquiring the rights, Warner Bro.s also gave Clarence Day's widow and playwrights Lindsay and Crouse substantial power over the film version.  Censorship issues of the day prevented an absolute translation of the script to the screen, but on the whole the script survived the transformation extremely well, and fueled by a host of flawless performances and remarkably fine production values LIFE WITH FATHER became as memorable on screen as it was on stage.Clarence Day is an eccentric man, absolutely certain that he alone is correct in all decisions, and eternally running afoul of wife Vinnie's scatterbrained logic, his four sons, visiting relatives, and terrified servants.  When a conversation reveals that he has never been baptised, Mr. Day laughs the matter off--but Vinnie is determined that he will be baptised whether he likes it or not.  Comic battlelines are drawn, and the result is a hilariously amusing portrait of Victorian manners and attitudes about everything from religion to the place of women in the world.The performances are superlative.  This would prove to be among the last great roles for both William Powell and Irene Dunne, who play Clarence and Vinnie Day, and to describe their work as flawless is actually an understatement: we completely believe in them from start to finish.  The same is true of the cast in general, which includes a remarkably beautiful Elizabeth Taylor; legendary comic ZaSu Pitt; and even a very young Martin Milner.  The costuming and sets also capture the look and feel of the era in remarkable fashion.  The film is perfectly executed from start to finish.But you might as well throw your money away than buy any of the releases presently available on VHS and DVD.  There is not a one of them worth a dime: the color is atrocious, the sound is horrific, and the picture so blurry that the only thing you'll get for your money is a headache--and this has been true of every factory release I've seen to date.It is a terrible shame that such a fine, indeed such a great film has been so incredibly neglected.  Fortunately for all concerned, LIFE WITH FATHER continues to turn up on television fairly often.  Until there is a restored release, don't buy a VHS or a DVD: tape it from television instead, for I can almost guarantee that the version you find there will be superior.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,A Classic Flim In Dire Need Of Restoration And A New DVD Release,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,2998,"['adult', 'Clarence', 'Day', 'Jr.', '1874-1935', 'joined', 'well-known', 'father', 'Wall', 'Street', 'developed', 'form', 'arthritis', 'left', 'semi-invalid', 'Shortly', 'death', 'published', 'LIFE', 'WITH', 'FATHER', 'humorous', 'memoir', 'Victorian', 'childhood', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'see', 'great', 'success', 'best', 'seller', 'novel', 'was', 'adapted', 'stage', '1939', 'Howard', 'Lindsay', 'Russell', 'Crouse', 'Warner', 'Bro.s', 'bought', 'film', 'rights', 'agreeing', 'wait', 'show', 'finished', 'Broadway', 'run', 'happened', 'studio', 'had', 'long', 'wait', 'play', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'Broadway', 'longest', 'running', 'shows', 'playing', 'almost', 'eight', 'years.In', 'acquiring', 'rights', 'Warner', 'Bro.s', 'also', 'gave', 'Clarence', 'Day', 'widow', 'playwrights', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'substantial', 'power', 'film', 'version', 'Censorship', 'issues', 'day', 'prevented', 'absolute', 'translation', 'script', 'screen', 'whole', 'script', 'survived', 'transformation', 'extremely', 'well', 'fueled', 'host', 'flawless', 'performances', 'remarkably', 'fine', 'production', 'values', 'LIFE', 'WITH', 'FATHER', 'became', 'memorable', 'screen', 'was', 'stage.Clarence', 'Day', 'eccentric', 'man', 'absolutely', 'certain', 'alone', 'correct', 'decisions', 'eternally', 'running', 'afoul', 'wife', 'Vinnie', 'scatterbrained', 'logic', 'four', 'sons', 'visiting', 'relatives', 'terrified', 'servants', 'When', 'conversation', 'never', 'been', 'baptised', 'Mr.', 'Day', 'matter', 'off', 'Vinnie', 'determined', 'will', 'be', 'baptised', 'not', 'Comic', 'battlelines', 'are', 'drawn', 'result', 'hilariously', 'amusing', 'portrait', 'Victorian', 'manners', 'attitudes', 'everything', 'religion', 'place', 'women', 'world.The', 'performances', 'are', 'superlative', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'last', 'great', 'roles', 'William', 'Powell', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'who', 'play', 'Clarence', 'Vinnie', 'Day', 'describe', 'work', 'flawless', 'actually', 'understatement', 'completely', 'believe', 'start', 'finish', 'same', 'true', 'cast', 'general', 'remarkably', 'beautiful', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'legendary', 'comic', 'ZaSu', 'Pitt', 'even', 'very', 'young', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'costuming', 'sets', 'also', 'capture', 'look', 'feel', 'era', 'remarkable', 'fashion', 'film', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'start', 'finish.But', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'throw', 'money', 'away', 'buy', 'releases', 'presently', 'available', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'not', 'one', 'worth', 'dime', 'color', 'atrocious', 'sound', 'horrific', 'picture', 'so', 'blurry', 'only', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'get', 'money', 'headache', 'been', 'true', 'factory', 'release', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date.It', 'terrible', 'shame', 'fine', 'indeed', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'been', 'so', 'incredibly', 'neglected', 'Fortunately', 'concerned', 'LIFE', 'WITH', 'FATHER', 'turn', 'up', 'television', 'fairly', 'often', 'restored', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'tape', 'television', 'instead', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'version', 'find', 'will', 'be', 'superior.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Life With Father VHS

354864,A2CARIYN3J3N2F,6303079709,George Delmerico,"[2, 2]","It astonishes me that Life With Father no longer has the same degree of popularity as other Hollywood films of the Forties that tell similar stories of family life in late 19th-Century America. This was one of the best of the Greatest Generation's stiffly satirical looks at its own elders, which had been filmed so sweetly in Meet Me in St. Louis, for example. The original Life With Father was a huge and much-honored Broadway hit, and the play was also adapted for a well-executed television series in the 1950s.But this funny and very gentle portrait of a large middle-class family in New York City circa 1880, a major Warner Bros. release at the time (1947), has been sorely neglected on video. Until now not even a watchable transfer existed. The comedy, one of Jack Warner's casualities-by-neglect, fell through cracks into the public domain, and as such has never been restored. This from the same studio executive who later outbid all others for the similar-in-feel The Music Man, now much honored on disc, including Blu-ray.The story is almost a catalog of 19th-century obsessions, with a twentieth-century bite. It is a recounting of one family's cranky, overbearing and semi-oblivious father, a straight-arrow businessman who is firmly convinced he will never need to be baptized into his wife's church. When he finally gets up to Heaven, by God, he'll just have a good talk with them and set them straight! Such shocking disregard for convention and his wife's devout beliefs sets off a family crisis, as Mother and her brood take a stand against this tyrannical but ultimately lovable man of the house.The film has standout performances by at least three huge stars--William Powell, Irene Dunne, and a very young Elizabeth Taylor. Supporting roles are near-perfect, including a rare appearance by Zazu Pitts in an iconic role as a fluttery aunt. The excellent dialog has just enough hilarity and bite to remain tasty, even though the complications are, despite the life-after-death stakes, relatively trivial to us today.If you've seen it, you may wonder if this newer transfer is superior to previous VHS copies, and the answer is a qualified yes. The video image is surprisingly richer and more colorful than the poorly produced tapes of  the past, but it's hardly up to Warners' current standards. If you watch your films on a TV set with a ""cinema"" or ""theater"" picture mode (which is much warmer and less blue than ""standard"" mode) the image will appear quite dark and lacking in contrast. Switching to a brighter mode, however, restores some luster and the picture is far more enjoyable. That's not something I'd normally endorse.But the play's the thing, and I'd like everyone to see this film at least once.

354868,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6303079709,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 2]","The washed out visuals wouldn't be so hard to take if that were the sole problem.  The faded quality sort of adds to the period look in a perverse way.  (Which is not to say I still wouldn't prefer to see it restored to glorious technicolor).  The sound quality is intolerable however.  I can put up with a lot but not sound this muddy.  The only reason I sat through it was because I was watching it relatively late at night and was just too tired to get up and turn it off (and had misplaced the remote).I've always enjoyed William Powell, who stars as the curmudgeonly late 19th century patriarch, Clarence Day, Sr..  And Irene Dunne, as his exuberant wife Vinnie--just radiates class and charm--even when playing a character who could be a bit of a ditz.  In point of fact, she brings a kind of level-headedness to her character's ditziness that makes it all her more appealing.  She's dumb as a fox really, and can wrap her irascible husband right around her finger.A very young Elizabeth Taylor appears as the Day family's houseguest--the traveling companion of Mr. Day's cousin Cora (ZaSu Pitts).  She's quite good in this (from what I can hear), as the eldest Day boy's first major crush.  That boy, Clarence Day, Jr., grew up to be the author of the memoir upon which the play and subsequent film were based.  So it's rooted in fact, even if (likely) gussied up a bit for stage and screen.But here's one little plot twist I couldn't quite gloss over.  Two of the sons, Clarence and John, Jr., are apparently responsible for the accidental poisoning of their mother.  They've been peddling some quack's nostrum throughout the city and have apparently decided to use their (mildly) ailing mother as a guinea pig--and this in an era before they even used guinea pigs as guinea pigs.Mother becomes violenlty ill and there's talk that they may lose her.  She does recover, perhaps in part, because her unbaptized husband agrees that he will finally subject himself to that rite and help guarantee that she will someday see him in Heaven.  OK, so maybe she wasn't suffering from a sickness unto death, after all.  Who knows?  This is the Hollywood version, after all.  Still, all of this comes to light on the very morning that Mr. Day agrees to be baptized.  Young John, the boy entrepreneur, admits his transgression when it's revealed that a dose of his medicine has killed a neighbor's dog.Mr. Day's insistence that young John go out and refund every last customer to whom the lad has sold a bottle for once seems like a very rational (and not just curmudgeonly) demand.  If the stuff killed a dog and sickened Mrs. Day, then whatever the 19th century version of a recall is called, seems more than appropriate.  Time was a-wastin', in fact.  But Mom's priority is Dad's baptism.  And that, my friends, makes no sense given the potential consequences of that quacksilver's being out in the world.Yeah, I know.  Don't think too much!

354869,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6303079709,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","This film has to be taken as being humorous. The father character, Mr Day, is an oldfashioned husband who dominates and controls his family absolutely, at least he wants to and he thinks he does. But his attitude is constantly rebutted by his wife, and then his children. And that is were the humor starts. He terrorizes the maids, without even realizing it. He tries to control his wife who is an artist at twirling him around her finger. His own sons implement his principles and that leads to some catastrophes. And of course he is not baptised and that is the recurring element that sounds both phony and hilarious. He wants his household to be run on a business-like basis and this leads to more problems than it solves. It is a perfect film to show how women can control an uncontrolable situation if they know how to use their charms, their backmail at times and their illogical logic that stands upside down and is totally unanswerable. The actors are perfect for the parts and their acting is admirable. It is the taming of the shrew upside down and it becomes the taming of the tamer by the shrew, or just plainly the mother or the woman. A funny and good film for some entertainment and some questioning of father-power. A young Elizabeth Taylor is already showing her potential in the film and we can imagine what she will become in a few years.Dtr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,How to tame the tamer of the shrew,1018742400,"04 14, 2002",2002,1379,"['film', 'be', 'taken', 'being', 'humorous', 'father', 'character', 'Mr', 'Day', 'oldfashioned', 'husband', 'who', 'family', 'absolutely', 'least', 'attitude', 'constantly', 'rebutted', 'wife', 'then', 'children', 'were', 'humor', 'maids', 'even', 'realizing', 'control', 'wife', 'who', 'artist', 'twirling', 'finger', 'own', 'sons', 'implement', 'principles', 'catastrophes', 'course', 'not', 'baptised', 'recurring', 'element', 'phony', 'hilarious', 'household', 'be', 'run', 'business-like', 'basis', 'more', 'problems', 'perfect', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'women', 'can', 'control', 'uncontrolable', 'situation', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'charms', 'backmail', 'times', 'illogical', 'logic', 'upside', 'down', 'totally', 'unanswerable', 'actors', 'are', 'perfect', 'parts', 'acting', 'admirable', 'taming', 'shrew', 'upside', 'down', 'taming', 'tamer', 'shrew', 'just', 'plainly', 'mother', 'woman', 'funny', 'good', 'film', 'entertainment', 'questioning', 'father-power', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'already', 'showing', 'potential', 'film', 'can', 'imagine', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'few', 'years.Dtr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Life With Father VHS

Why, I get lonesome for him even when I go to Ohio.&quot;  Such is the relationship of Clare and his wife Vinnie.  She gives, he yells.  Their children are little devils  dresses up as angels, but who cares?  They're all hilarious.  Vinnie knows  Clare loves her, because she keeps reminding him he does, but he never  tells her.  He is rather dominating, and very opinionated.  Vinne likes to  spend money, and she has to trick Clare when it comes to him paying the  bills.  This movie is really the story of their oldest son Clarence, and  his troubles with his father (hence the name).  Well, when he falls in love  (with Elizabeth Taylor; I forgot her name so we'll call her Liz), his dad  gives him some pointers.  Let the women know who is boss.  However, Clare  doesn't know what to do when the woman cries, as he finds out when Vinnie  gets sick.  She also gets exasperated with Clare because he won't get  baptized (because of Liz, the fact is revealed that he wasn't baptized.  He  decides it's pointless.  Vinnie tells him he won't go to Heaven, but he's  confident she'll get him in.  Vinnie is worried, Because if he isn't  baptized, he has no name.  Therefore they are not married, and their  children are illegitimate).  Clarence has to get Liz to like him, Clare  must realize that being baptized is necessary, and Vinnie just has to deal  with everyone.  All in all a great movie for the family to watch.

He is successful but he is also highly opinionated and domineering. He expects his household to be run just so and pinches the pennies until they scream. His wife, played by Irene Dunne, is nothing like him. She is friendly, gregarious and likes to spend. Her accounting is both creative and ludicrous and a joy to watch. Although he is the screamer, there is no doubt it is she who is in control.This couple has fours sons, each a bundle of energy and capable of causing plenty of chaos by himself. The youngest is just barely in grammar school and the oldest is just about ready to head off to college. Their chaotically ordinary lives are interrupted when some cousins pass through from out of town. A young and sweet Elizabeth Taylor is one of these cousins and she falls for the oldest son almost as hard as he falls for her. Father's advice on how to handle these matters works about as well on Liz and it does on Irene Dunne. It works not at all.There are various little plot lines running throughout the story but, mainly, it is about a man who believes he is in control and who is wrapped around the little finger of his wife. When the chips are down, he will do anything for her. There are lots of laughs and a sense of nostalgia running throughout the entire production. It's fun for the entire family.The movie is great.

One of the big surprises in the movie is when two female visitors descend upon Father's house, much to his consternation, and we find that the younger of the two is none other than Elizabeth Taylor, who wastes no time in making eyes at soon-to-be college man, Jimmy Lydon. This little romance inadvertently yields the main plot of the movie, as young Liz innocently makes conversation about baptism, and it is discovered that William Powell never quite got around to taking the plunge. So begins the campaign to get her husband baptized launched by Irene Dunne with a little help from minister Edmund Gwenn, with complications along the way concerning a patent medicine.&quot;Life with Father&quot; is a sentimental comedy epitomizing all that was best about &quot;the good old days&quot; of turn of the century New York.

I realize that it is based on the longest running non-musical play on Broadway, running for 8 years, a record that stood for several decades. When the idea of making it into a movie was being batted around Hollywood, every major studio was hot to do it. Every male and female lead in Hollywood wanted to play the two lead roles of the married couple of Clarence and Vinny Day. Even Mary Pickford came out of a ten year retirement and agreed to do a screen test for the role, which she would never have done before.Warner Bros., however, got their act together first, paying half a million dollars for the rights, an astronomical sum for the time. For that they deserve some credit, and it remains one of the most important movies about this period, treating the humorous story of an upper class family with a deft touch in its light-hearted humor and nostalgia but without being overly sentimental. William Powell is great as the cantankerous but ultimately lovable father as well as Irene Dunne as his clever wife who is always foiling the father's efforts. It remains a charming piece of fluff from the gilded and storied age of the robber barons of the 1880s and 1890s, a time of great optimism in America. The ""Gay 90s"" truly were gay--a sad contrast to the America of today only a little over a century later. But I just didn't find the story that engaging although I give it four stars just for its historical significance if nothing else.

William Powell plays Clarence Day, sr. (Claire), the stern patriarch of the family.  Irene Dunne plays Lavinia Day (Vinnie), the quintessential mother who keeps the family running.  The Days have four sons.This takes place in Manhattan during a kinder and gentler period (turn of the century) when men were gentlemen and women were ladies.  There is no real storyline, it is just a slice of life.  There are some running storylines including the fact the Father has not been baptized, the visiting of a maiden cousin Cora and a young girl (played by Elizabeth Taylor) and the fact that Mother has no concept of money.This is a beautiful movie about a bygone period that many would like to see return.  The acting is universally excellent.  In a change of pace from his trademark screwball comedy, Powell is brilliant as the straight man.  Irene Dunne is her usual charming self.  Zasu Pitts is uncharacteristically subdued as cousin Cora.  Elizabeth Taylor has one her few smaller roles that ushers her from child star to ing&eacute;nue and the glimmer of what to come shows through.The only complaint is the color.  If it did not say that it was shot in Technicolor, you would assume that it was colorized.  Everyone's skin tone is the same and most of the backgrounds are grey.

354904,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,6303079709,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[2, 2]","This movie is about a middle class family set in 1880s New York. The controlling figure is Clarence (Claire) Day, Sr. (William Powell), a Wall Street broker, who expects his family members to live according to his impossible standards. Author Clarence Day wrote this story in 1936 about his family life in New York in New Yorker magazine, and it was first used for a non-musical Broadway show which ran for seven successful years. In 1947, this story was written for the movie starring William Powell and Irene Dunn. This is essentially a character study of a man who runs his family like an investment firm of Wall Street. He is a penny pincher, cautious about money; evaluate religious and spiritual matters with the mind of a financial analyst with no room for mistakes. His advice to his son about romantic matters is shrewd. His beautiful wife Vinnie (Irene Dunn) is understanding, patient, and firm in her beliefs, which includes that her husband is essentially good man who has to be baptized. She persists in her beliefs, and prevails in her style of mothering three sons in spite of her husband's constant annoying behavior. Irene Dunn offers a great performance as a spiritual wife who does her best, and succeeds in convincing her husband's attitude towards faith.
