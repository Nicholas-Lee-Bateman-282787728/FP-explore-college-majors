419703,A18BD98SU49UB7,6304410816,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[2, 2]","Heavy is a story about a restaurant and its awkward inhabitants. At the center are two lonely character's in search for something better. The first is an overweight man, Victor, (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who lives with is agitating mother. She complain's and talks so much that he uses his daily reautine of serving her to tone her out. Second is a young woman, Callie, (Liv Tyler) who is hired at the restaurant after recently abandoning college. There is a pure energy between these two people as they begin to face their problems.Heavy reminded me of of Sling blade in a way. With the exception that even though Carl's sins were more necessary in Sling Blade, Victor's sins in Heavy were a result of depression and desire. The reason for the similarity may lie in the camera work more than the story, but the characerization of purity between Victor and Carl are striking. Victor falls in love with Callie, but won't act apon that love because he fears the way he looks will cause rejection. The trueness of the story comes in my favorite scene when Victor finally realizes that he has a chance and takes it. The touch scene is really heart-felt.Its a sad movie that ends on a note of hopefullness as though the story could continue on beyond the credits. All of the actors, and the director deserve high credit for this emotional film.",4,Finding yourself,1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,1335,"['Heavy', 'story', 'restaurant', 'awkward', 'inhabitants', 'center', 'are', 'two', 'lonely', 'character', 'search', 'something', 'better', 'first', 'overweight', 'man', 'Victor', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'who', 'agitating', 'mother', 'complain', 'talks', 'so', 'much', 'daily', 'reautine', 'serving', 'tone', 'out', 'Second', 'young', 'woman', 'Callie', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'who', 'hired', 'restaurant', 'recently', 'abandoning', 'college', 'pure', 'energy', 'two', 'people', 'begin', 'face', 'problems.Heavy', 'reminded', 'Sling', 'blade', 'way', 'exception', 'even', 'Carl', 'sins', 'were', 'more', 'necessary', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'Victor', 'sins', 'Heavy', 'were', 'result', 'depression', 'desire', 'reason', 'similarity', 'may', 'lie', 'camera', 'work', 'more', 'story', 'characerization', 'purity', 'Victor', 'Carl', 'are', 'striking', 'Victor', 'love', 'Callie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'act', 'love', 'way', 'will', 'cause', 'rejection', 'trueness', 'story', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'Victor', 'finally', 'chance', 'touch', 'scene', 'really', 'heart-felt.Its', 'sad', 'movie', 'note', 'hopefullness', 'story', 'could', 'continue', 'credits', 'actors', 'director', 'deserve', 'high', 'credit', 'emotional', 'film']",Heavy VHS
419704,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6304410816,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 7]","Watching Heavy only confirmed the idea that director James Mangold may be suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder.  He needs medication or at least the ability to complete a thought before he tries to ramble us through another emotional sentence.  Heavy could have been a very complete and emotional film using some raw talent that prior to this had never been explored.  There could have been a very strong story developed behind Pruitt Taylor Vince's character of Victor instead of the inconsistent scenes that I witnessed.  Liv Tyler could have honestly stepped up in the Hollywood atmosphere on this film alone, if she would have just attempted to take one small chance and go outside of herself.  The same could be said for both Shelly Winters and Deborah Harry, who just never felt anything more creative than a walking clich&eacute;.  Mangold had the power in his hands to really set the stage on fire, but instead we are forced to watch a very inconsistent, obscure, and emotionally voided film that tries to tackle too many issues, without solving any in the long run.I initially envisioned Heavy's story line to be about a man, concerned about his weight, being the outcast member of society.  At first, and at brief intermittent moments of the film, that was the case, but something changed as the other characters were introduced.  Liv Tyler became a disturbing obsession instead of a passionate, yet simple, love for Victor.  There are scenes in which Vince thinks that he sees a dead Callie walking through his house or even floating in a puddle, but alas, they are only daydreams.  Why were they daydreams?  What was the overall relevance of these scenes?  Was it to show a different side, a troubled side, to Victor, or was it merely used to confuse the audience?  I thought that perhaps she was representing Victor's mother, but even that was stretching a bit.  It was moments like this that really brought a speed bump into this film.  There were other scenes similar to this one that really pulled us away from the central focus of the film, the growth of Victor.  The encounters with Leo seemed forced, and the clich&eacute;d and random sexual advances of Delores seemed to come out of left field.  The moments between Victor and his mother didn't even feel real.  I felt as if Shelly Winters was speaking from a cue card instead of her heart.  There was one emotional scene where it felt as stale as cardboard, yet it was supposed to evoke tears.  Pathetic.  I felt at times that Mangold had one of those ""Choose your own plot books"" and just randomly flipped through it during this film.Outside of random plot interjections coming at you from every angle (quite distractingly), there was some decent acting from our lead character Victor played by Pruitt Taylor Vince.  Vince was able to bottle up the emotions of the situations around him very well, the twitching eyes was not something that I thought helped build his character (was that a acting trait or actually Vince's eyes), while the stress eating moments did seem very human.  Vince is a strong actor.  He is typically cast as the psycho in most films, but I thought in this film he did stretch his wings a bit.  It wasn't far, but he brought compassion and emotion to a very forgettable character.  He is the only one worth watching in this film, while the rest of the cast just hurt the film further.  Liv Tyler has trouble acting.  She talks about never taking an acting class before, and in this film you can tell.  She brought nothing new to the screen.  The connection between her and Vince was non-existent.  There was no chemistry, no power, nothing that made me really see a love between the two.  These two have a very silly match.Outside of the acting and the zigzag plot, there was not much else going for the film.  The music was a tease.  There were some scenes where you would have Vince walking along the road, powerful, emotional, and together, and the music would suddenly change.  Either it was poor editing or just bad music placement, but it seemed to be jumping just as much as Vince's eyes.  It made me cringe in my seat.  I just get extremely worked up about films that claim to be an emotional powerhouse of an independent film, yet it feels like crayons were used instead of the power of the paintbrush.  Again, Mangold had a great film under the surface of all this muck, but it just wasn't worth wading through to get to.Overall, I was not impressed with this film.  If Mangold would have stayed the course, kept us glued to Vince's powerful character, and developed him using the other minor characters around him, than I think it would have been a winner.  If Liv Tyler would have been a stronger central character and perhaps stepped outside of her lines, than we may have had a winner.  If the point would have been to show a weak man overcome the boundaries of his life, than I think we would have had a winner.  Instead, we are left with unattached moments that come from left field and walking cardboard characters that spit clich&eacute; lines into the sky instead of to the viewers.  Heavy had so much potential, one can only blame Mangold for all these disasters.  Skip it.  Have yourself a big pizza and watch some Chris Farley films.  Now, there was a big guy that was random, but could at least hold a script together!Grade: ** out of *****",2,I am fat ma!,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,5364,"['Watching', 'Heavy', 'only', 'confirmed',

In the end though, I found the movie to be EXTREMELY slow-paced. Maybe it was intended to be slow, in order to show how slow Victor (James Mangold) is because of his weight. Or maybe its a metaphor for how slow his life is. In any case, the slow-pace hurts the movie and doesn't help it. Also Victor should have had more lines of dialogue.

Director and writer James Mangold is uncompromising in his  determination that we live, breathe, feel and taste this man's loneliness,  his isolation from others and his pitiful desire to find some beauty in his  dreary life.Pruitt Taylor Vince stars as a fat thirty-something who  still lives with his mother and is the fry cook at her cafe/bar.  I think  he over acts at times, but perhaps that's what makes him so effective.  He  is painful to watch.  Deborah Harry is entirely believable as the trampy  waitress who's seen better days, and Shelley Winters is her natural self as  the mother.  Liv Tyler, daughter of Aerosmith rocker Steve Tyler, and seen  a few years back with Alicia Silverstone in the ""Crazy"" music video, proves  there's more to her than a beautiful figure.The images, like still  pieces from an art gallery, will stay with you: the breakfast left on the  table for two weeks, the orange juice turning brown; the ugly little black  and white dog: the Pete &amp; Dolly's neon sign in red letters; the dirty  dishes in the sink with the water dripping.  They won't need subtitles for  this one in foreign lands because not much is said.  Mangold eschews  dialogue for the camera.Memorable are the breathe mints at the end of  the runway and the visit to the Culinary Institute of America.

Heavy is one of them, and on that score it probably gets my vote for the best film depiction of what unrequited love actually feels like.  The level of emotional intensity that James Mangold achieves is blistering, as in the scene where Victor retreats to the storeroom and breaks up after the death of his mother, or the ending where Liv Tyler confronts him in the restaurant after he's smashed several dishes.  Unlike other ""realistic"" indie films that concern a mismatched pair (I'm thinking of Garden State or the overrated Lost in Translation), the relationship between Victor and Callie is entirely believable- so much so that at times the film is almost painful to watch.  This is due to the fact that the characters themselves ring true, and for this everyone from Pruitt Taylor Vince to Liv Tyler and Shelly Winters should be commended for their spot-on performances.  James Mangold also manages to inject a little hope at the end without resorting to Hollywood cliches.  It's difficult to find this movie, but I would certainly say it's worth seeking it out.

The acting by the lead character (Pruitt) was outstanding as was the other characters played by Liv Tyler, Deborah Harry and Shelly Winters.  The story backdrop is a small nothing town and shows broken lives and failed chances.  Enter Liv Tyler who appears in a bar applying for a job.  Shelly Winters is the owner and mother of Pruitt - her overweight balding son with a roving eye but a good heart.  The other waitress (Deborah Harry) is none too happy with the addition of a beautiful young woman.  The resident drunk doesn't seem to care.  Besides Liv Tyler's boyfriend, who we don't really see too much, this is it for characters and most of it takes place in the bar yet we barely notice as we are absorbed into the story that unfolds before us.  Predictably, the son falls in love with the new waitress but he never takes a chance because he has already figured out how it would end.  Yet the waitress' life isn't as golden as one would think.  We see glimpses into each character's life and depressing doesn't begin to cover it.  In spite of moments in each character's life that reflect a brillance, they are unable to see it for themselves.  They are too caught up in the misery of their day-to-day existence and it would take too much effort to break free.  At one point the son tries to change and we see hope for the first time burning in his eyes but it's built on lies and we see the consequences....... It's as if you give up on life, life pretty much passes you by and gives up on you - AND the results are there on screen serving as a warning.  Either that or the filmmaker hates small towns and thinks you need to leave to get a better life. The whole mood of this movie is heavy but the sentiment and lush characterization made this movie worth it - repeat viewings even!  A little gem of a movie which prompts me to look for later films by this director.",5,poigant story that was well told,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,1933,"['heavy', 'handed', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'shines', 'acting', 'lead', 'character', 'Pruitt', 'was', 'outstanding', 'was', 'other', 'characters', 'played', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'story', 'backdrop', 'small', 'nothing', 'town', 'broken', 'lives', 'failed', 'chances', 'Enter', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'who', 'bar', 'applying', 'job', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'owner', 'mother', 'Pruitt', 'overweight', 'balding', 'son', 'roving', 'eye', 'good', 'heart', 'other', 'waitress', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'none', 'too', 'happy', 'addition', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'resident', 'drunk', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'too', 'much', 'characters', 'most', 'place', 'bar', 'yet', 'barely', 'notice', 'are', 'absorbed', 'story', 'Predictably', 'son', 'love', 'new', 'waitress', 'never', 'chance', 'already', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'waitress', 'life', ""n't"", 'as', 'golden', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'see', 'glimpses', 'character', 'life', 'depressing', ""n't"", 'begin', 'cover', 'spite', 'moments', 'character', 'life', 'reflect', 'brillance', 'are', 'unable', 'see', 'are', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'misery', 'day-to-day', 'existence', 'would', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'break', 'free', 'one', 'point', 'son', 'change', 'see', 'hope', 'first', 'time', 'burning', 'eyes', 'built', 'lies', 'see', 'consequences', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'life', 'pretty', 'much', 'passes', 'up', 'results', 'are', 'there', 'screen', 'serving', 'warning', 'filmmaker', 'small', 'towns', 'thinks', 'need', 'leave', 'get', 'better', 'life', 'whole', 'mood', 'movie', 'heavy', 'sentiment', 'lush', 'characterization', 'made', 'movie', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'even', 'little', 'gem', 'movie', 'look', 'later', 'films', 'director']",Heavy VHS

Shelly Winters is on her last legs and she runs Pete & Dolly's, a roadside food and beer joint. Her slow-witted, overweight son, Victor is a terrific cook. The regulars are tired and drunk. The waitress is a loser with guys. Liv Tyler shows up in the glory of her youth and changes the stale dynamics. She immediately infatuates Victor.James Mangold directs and some of his family members help out in this small production. The film and sound are fine and there's a professional look without glossy studio values. Another words, this is a fine independent film made for peanuts because a lot of people believed in the director's vision. Amazing these things ever get off the ground.I did wonder about half way through the picture if Victor was going to do something yucky with sensitive Liv Tyler, but it's not that kind of picture. Victor doesn't exactly have sex with anyone. This film is a slice of fascinating life. It runs a little slow and possibly it was too long for most audiences. Hell.

Each action and emotion logically follows the one before, instead of being contrived to fit into some form. This isn't hero-wants-girl, hero-loses-weight, hero-gets-girl, or the opposite, where the hero displays the fatal flaw which will hold him back all his life.If you are used to the Hollywood formula, you won't know what's going to happen next, though by intuition, you will figure it out eventually, because these are real people; you know people like these-- unless you've lived in Levittown all your life, in which case you should see this film because you need the education.Brilliant performances all around. I bought this video because I'm a Deborah Harry fan, and here she proves her natural acting skills once again. She is so good, it's difficult to remember that in her career, she has not been primarily an actress. Shelley Winters is great. Everyone is wonderful. The lead actor has very few lines, because he is a loner, but he is so good, he communicates without having to speak.The film is slow-paced, but not plodding.

Deborah Harry's performance as &quot;Delores&quot;, a one-dimentional waitress at a small-town hash house called &quot;Pete and Dolly's&quot; is worth the watch of the entire film.

His &quot;visions&quot; of her drowning symbolize his concerns for her--he fears she may drown in the same sea of hopelessness that he (and all around him) already have succumbed to.  The recurring theme of planes flying overheard symbolize hope--going somewhere else, doing something else, getting out of the quagmire of hopelessness that seems to be their destiny.The actor who plays Vince is absolutely fantastic.
