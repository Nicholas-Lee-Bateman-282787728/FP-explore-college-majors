1538360,A23MLQP13YKVWM,B007V4ETS2,AZ KID 95,"[5, 5]","Recalling this excellent series from when it was originally broadcast I purchased it after havng read the Amazon reviews of this set. Though mentioned in other reviews, there is no explanation as to why the entire series of all 34 episodes does not include the theme song associated with the show. The song is readily available on goggle and elsewhere. Perhaps it is a question of copyright royalties and Timeless Video was unwilling to play, though on their website they list the series at over $34.00.. I also feel that Timeless video was a bit less than candid claiming the set included the entire series, but did not mention the exceptionally poor quality  of &#8220;The Gun that killed Lincoln&#8221; until one second before it started to play with a brief slide explanation--so fast that one needs to hit the pause button to read its contents. The picture quality of that episode is a &#34;1&#34; star.&#34; There is, however, yet  another problem that should have never happened.The credits at the end of several episodes (specifically the third panel) was identical, repeated again and again.The first panel of credits has Jock Mahoney as Yancy Derringer. The second panel has Kevin Hagen as John Colton and X. Brands as Pahoo-Ka-Ta-Wah..The third panel is supposed to list the guest stars for that particular episode. Several episodes (#24&#8211;28) from the &#8220;The Gun That Murdered Lincoln&#8221; through and including &#8220;Collector's Item,&#8221; &#8220;Fire on the Frontier,&#8221; &#8220;Duel at the Oaks,&#8221; and &#8220;The Wayward Warrior&#8221; have the same identical third panel &#8211; with NONE of the correct guest actors listed. I have not seen the episodes beyond that. The problem may well continue through to the last episode 34. I wrote to Timeless Video and received a short reply which in effect stated &#34;that is the way we got them and that's the way we produced them.&#34; Certainly if Timeless Video could insert an &#34;explanation&#34; slide (card) about the &#34;Gun that shot Lincoln&#34; episode, it could have inserted the correct (third) credit cards for the episodes I mentioned. The cast information is readily available on TV episode Guide among other sources. For the sake of accurate TV history such errors should never have gotten through.. The information is available. I guess the bottom line costs and profit margin  prevented a total 5 star product from being made and released. I wonder if the above is part of the reason for Amazon dumping its stock on December 5 (&#8220;Movie & TV deals) for $13.49 -- almost one-third the Timeless retail price? I will be very wary of other Timeless Video products.",3,Less than meets the eye at first glance,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,2665,"['Recalling', 'excellent', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'purchased', 'havng', 'read', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'set', 'Though', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'explanation', 'why', 'entire', 'series', '34', 'episodes', 'not', 'include', 'theme', 'song', 'associated', 'show', 'song', 'readily', 'available', 'goggle', 'elsewhere', 'Perhaps', 'question', 'copyright', 'royalties', 'Timeless', 'Video', 'was', 'unwilling', 'play', 'website', 'list', 'series', '34.00..', 'also', 'feel', 'Timeless', 'video', 'was', 'bit', 'less', 'candid', 'claiming', 'set', 'included', 'entire', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'exceptionally', 'poor', 'quality', '8220', 'Gun', 'killed', 'Lincoln', '8221', 'one', 'second', 'started', 'play', 'brief', 'slide', 'explanation', 'so', 'fast', 'one', 'hit', 'pause', 'button', 'read', 'contents', 'picture', 'quality', 'episode', '34', '1', '34', 'star.', '34', 'however', 'yet', 'problem', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'happened.The', 'credits', 'end', 'several', 'episodes', 'specifically', 'third', 'panel', 'was', 'identical', 'repeated', 'again', 'again.The', 'first', 'panel', 'credits', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'Yancy', 'Derringer', 'second', 'panel', 'Kevin', 'Hagen', 'John', 'Colton', 'X', 'Brands', 'Pahoo-Ka-Ta-Wah..The', 'third', 'panel', 'supposed', 'list', 'guest', 'stars', 'particular', 'episode', 'Several', 'episodes', '24', '8211', '28', '8220', 'Gun', 'Murdered', 'Lincoln', '8221', 'including', '8220', 'Collector', 'Item', '8221', '8220', 'Fire', 'Frontier', '8221', '8220', 'Duel', 'Oaks', '8221', '8220', 'Wayward', 'Warrior', '8221', 'have', 'same', 'identical', 'third', 'panel', '8211', 'NONE', 'correct', 'guest', 'actors', 'listed', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episodes', 'problem', 'may', 'well', 'continue', 'last', 'episode', '34', 'wrote', 'Timeless', 'Video', 'received', 'short', 'reply', 'effect', 'stated', '34', 'way', 'got', 'way', 'produced', 'them.', '34', 'Certainly', 'Timeless', 'Video', 'could', 'insert', '34', 'explanation', '34', 'slide', 'card', '34', 'Gun', 'shot', 'Lincoln', '34', 'episode', 'could', 'have', 'inserted', 'correct', 'third', 'credit', 'cards', 'episodes', 'mentioned', 'cast', 'information', 'readily', 'available', 'TV', 'episode', 'Guide', 'other', 'sources', 'sake', 'accurate', 'TV', 'history', 'such', 'errors', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'gotten', 'through..', 'information', 'available', 'guess', 'bottom', 'line', 'costs', 'profit', 'margin', 'prevented', 'total', '5', 'star', 'product', 'being', 'made', 'released', 'wonder', 'above', 'part', 'reason', 'Amazon', 'dumping', 'stock', 'December', '5', '8220', 'Movie', 'TV', 'deals', '13.49', 'almost', 'Timeless', 'retail', 'price', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'wary', 'other', 'Timeless', 'Video', 'products']",N/A

Having watched seven episodes so far, I can say it is a fine, fun series with good plots, good acting and interesting guest stars and co-stars. Speaking of which, Frances Bergen, mother of Candace Bergen, is very good in the series. Others reviewers complain about the sound, but all I'm using is the projector's built in speaker and I have had no problem. Sure, it may look a bit washed out once on a while, but this is from 1958-59 and source elements have worn a bit in fifty-five years. Probably the original negatives are long gone. We can either complain that this doesn't look as good my Twilight Zone blu-ray set, or we can be glad that the complete run of 34 episodes has survived at all. Personally, I vote for the latter! Yancy Derringer and Disney's live-action Zorro series, from the same period, both have class. Of course the Zorro episodes had much, much more money poured into them, but in this case Yancey Derringer makes up for a smaller budget with creativity and class. If you are hesitating getting this series, don't!

Purchased based on reviews and fell in love with it and all the actors. I felt Yancy Derringer started it all for Jim West, Bond, and any riverboat gambler type.  I have turned my friends on to Yancy Derringer and they all love it.  You forget about it being black and white and any sound problems are just for a few seconds.  I felt that for the age of the film it was put on DVD pretty darn good. The light fingered Jody is one of my favorites.  The guest stars are wonderful and it takes a few minutes to remember them as they are so young on this show (at least to me).

1538376,A1KUTHUSRZQ75L,B007V4ETS2,"George Spear ""George Spear""","[69, 69]","When a Birmingham, Alabama TV station began showing Yancy Derringer weekday afternoons in 1961, it was almost enough to cause this young man to fail the fifth grade due to truancy.  I was first introduced to the show courtesy of  a case of German Measles.  While bored one afternoon waiting for the red spots to go away, I turned on the TV set and became mesmerized by Yancy and his sidekick, Pahoo.I was awestruck by the clever concealment of Yancy's weapon of choice...the derringer.  There was one up his fancy white sleeve, one up his white britches leg and who would have thought of hiding one in his white pillbox crown gambler's  hat.  The latter was immensely valuable since every western hero could count on being  surprised at least once from behind and knocked senseless by the villain's six-gun.  Not  Yancy,  the derringer always ""cushioned""  the blow from above.  At least that made sense when I was 11.And that Pahoo!  Took no prisoners.  He had this long  knife in a scabbard over his shoulder.  In a fraction of a second, he could send it down range and  have it buried to the hilt  before nemesis Jack Elam could focus with his good eye.  And if, by chance,  15 inches of steel  buried in your chest wasn't enough, Pahoo always kept the sawed-off shotgun under his serape-looking-thing and could pump out more ground meat than McDonald's .I always tried to mimic the hand signals Pahoo would use, since he never talked.  Yancy could carry on a conversation with Pahoo and Pahoo would always respond with one or two hand signals.  Needless to say, conversations were short, as were the gunfights.  After all, they were derringers , you know.There were favorite episodes, like the one where some outlaw dared to dress like Yancy and rob banks.  He had this Pahoo lookalike too.  I always got spooked by that one because I kept imagining what  two Pahoos could do to each other.  Then there was the episode at Christmas when Yancy sings, I believe,  ""Dixie""  to the children in an orphan's home.  Imagine a hero doing that now.  The PC police would go Pahoo, or er...postal.I've read a number of articles about the series and why it was canceled after only one season.  There were problems with their bread sponsor and  their air time was opposite another popular show.  Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to seeing it again.  I just hope it looks as good on a 60-inch Sony as it did back then on our 19-inch Zenith Black and white.",4,Adventure at its Best!,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,2445,"['When', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama', 'TV', 'station', 'began', 'showing', 'Yancy', 'Derringer', 'weekday', 'afternoons', '1961', 'was', 'almost', 'enough', 'cause', 'young', 'man', 'fail', 'fifth', 'grade', 'due', 'truancy', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'show', 'courtesy', 'case', 'German', 'Measles', 'bored', 'one', 'afternoon', 'waiting', 'red', 'spots', 'go', 'away', 'turned', 'TV', 'set', 'became', 'mesmerized', 'Yancy', 'sidekick', 'Pahoo.I', 'was', 'awestruck', 'clever', 'concealment', 'Yancy', 'weapon', 'choice', 'derringer', 'was', 'one', 'fancy', 'white', 'sleeve', 'one', 'white', 'britches', 'leg', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'hiding', 'one', 'white', 'pillbox', 'crown', 'gambler', 'hat', 'latter', 'was', 'immensely', 'valuable', 'western', 'hero', 'could', 'count', 'being', 'surprised', 'least', 'once', 'behind', 'knocked', 'senseless', 'villain', 'six-gun', 'Not', 'Yancy', 'derringer', 'always', 'cushioned', 'blow', 'least', 'made', 'sense', 'when', 'was', '11.And', 'Pahoo', 'Took', 'prisoners', 'had', 'long', 'knife', 'scabbard', 'shoulder', 'fraction', 'second', 'could', 'send', 'down', 'range', 'have', 'buried', 'hilt', 'nemesis', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'could', 'focus', 'good', 'eye', 'chance', '15', 'inches', 'steel', 'buried', 'chest', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Pahoo', 'always', 'kept', 'sawed-off', 'shotgun', 'serape-looking-thing', 'could', 'pump', 'out', 'more', 'ground', 'meat', 'McDonald', '.I', 'always', 'tried', 'mimic', 'hand', 'signals', 'Pahoo', 'would', 'use', 'never', 'talked', 'Yancy', 'could', 'carry', 'conversation', 'Pahoo', 'Pahoo', 'would', 'always', 'respond', 'one', 'two', 'hand', 'signals', 'Needless', 'say', 'conversations', 'were', 'short', 'were', 'gunfights', 'were', 'derringers', 'know.There', 'were', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'one', 'where', 'outlaw', 'dared', 'dress', 'Yancy', 'rob', 'banks', 'had', 'Pahoo', 'lookalike', 'too', 'always', 'got', 'spooked', 'one', 'kept', 'imagining', 'what', 'two', 'Pahoos', 'could', 'do', 'other', 'Then', 'was', 'episode', 'Christmas', 'when', 'Yancy', 'sings', 'believe', 'Dixie', 'children', 'orphan', 'home', 'Imagine', 'hero', 'doing', 'now', 'PC', 'police', 'would', 'go', 'Pahoo', 'er', 'postal.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'number', 'articles', 'series', 'why', 'was', 'canceled', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'were', 'problems', 'bread', 'sponsor', 'air', 'time', 'was', 'opposite', 'popular', 'show', 'Nonetheless', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'just', 'hope', 'as', 'good', '60-inch', 'Sony', 'did', 'back', 'then', '19-inch', 'Zenith', 'Black', 'white']",N/A

Despite that, the shows are just as enjoyable as I remember them from when I was a kid. I love the interaction of Yancy and his Native American friend Pahoo, and the humor reminds me of the best of the Maverick shows. Jock Mahoney is perfect as Yancy. I loved him in the show as an 8 year old and I still do. I've been waiting for many years for this show to be available either on Netflix or on TV Land or some such. When I saw the entire show was available at Amazon on DVD, I bought it right away. I don't know why this show lasted just one season. But at least back then, seasons were 34-39 episodes long (summer reruns truly were just that) so you have a chance to watch what would today be 2 seasons of shows. ""...on every danger trail, On riverboat, in manor house, And now and then in jail."" Actually, Yancy spends a lot of time in jail, that's part of the running joke on the show. Best $20 I've spent in a while. I viewed some of the episodes with my mom on a recent visit with her and we both laughed and enjoyed them immensely. Yancy was like a New Orleans James Bond before James Bond made it to the movies. BTW, Jock Mahoney started his career as a stunt man and does many of his own stunts in the show. He also was the oldest actor to date to play Tarzan in movies (he made 2 of them). If you remember the show from the late 50s, this is a must buy, and if you just want to watch a fun show from that era, you won't go wrong.",5,"""They sing of Yancy Derringer...""",1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,1556,"['Sadly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'wonderful', 'theme', 'song', 'discs', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'licensing', 'fee', 'shows', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'love', 'interaction', 'Yancy', 'Native', 'American', 'friend', 'Pahoo', 'humor', 'best', 'Maverick', 'shows', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'perfect', 'Yancy', 'loved', 'show', '8', 'year', 'old', 'still', 'do', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'many', 'years', 'show', 'be', 'available', 'Netflix', 'TV', 'Land', 'such', 'When', 'saw', 'entire', 'show', 'was', 'available', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'bought', 'right', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'show', 'lasted', 'just', 'one', 'season', 'least', 'back', 'then', 'seasons', 'were', '34-39', 'episodes', 'long', 'summer', 'reruns', 'truly', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'have', 'chance', 'watch', 'what', 'would', 'today', 'be', '2', 'seasons', 'shows', 'danger', 'trail', 'riverboat', 'manor', 'house', 'now', 'then', 'jail', 'Actually', 'Yancy', 'lot', 'time', 'jail', 'part', 'running', 'joke', 'show', 'Best', '20', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'while', 'viewed', 'episodes', 'mom', 'recent', 'visit', 'laughed', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'Yancy', 'was', 'New', 'Orleans', 'James', 'Bond', 'James', 'Bond', 'made', 'movies', 'BTW', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'started', 'career', 'stunt', 'man', 'many', 'own', 'stunts', 'show', 'also', 'was', 'oldest', 'actor', 'date', 'play', 'Tarzan', 'movies', 'made', '2', 'remember', 'show', 'late', '50s', 'must', 'buy', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'fun', 'show', 'era', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",N/A

Thanks to COZI and ANTENNA TV and DVD's a lot of those shows have become available. If your watching on TV you catch a couple of episodes and realize just how bad the acting and writing were. The reaction is worse if you bought a few seasons only to realize at twelve your critical viewing skills were minimal at best. However there are a few that not only live up to your memory but surpass your expectations and Yancy Derringer is one of those like Maverick. The writing was smart, the plots interesting, and the acting remarkably good. Jock Mahoney is fine as the lead and X Brands steals scenes even though he never speaks. I have a suspicion the success of the series owes much to the writing, producing, and directing team of Richard Sale and Mary Loos who apparently had total control over their collaboration. It's unfortunate this series ended after only one year. My wife suggested Sale and Loos may have divorced and that caused the demise. They did divorce but I have no idea when but regardless they did create a memorable show that still holds up. Another reason may have been the inclusion of A list character actors of that period including John Dehner, Robert Rockwell, Gene Evans, Dennis Patrick, Charles Maxwell, Ray Danton, Marie Windsor, Bill Williams, Claude Akins, John Qualen, and Robert Lowery to list a few.

Yance is a southern gentlemen type, like Rehet Butler.  He is an unofficial undercover man for  the city of New Orleans.  His boss is played by Kevin Hagen, who spent part of two seasons chasing little people in the TV show Land of the Giants.  Yance is accompanied by his faithful indian friend, Pahoo-Ka-a-Wa,  who never speaks and uses sign language. He is also very  handy with his knives.  Yancy and Pahoo fight various bad guys ranging from pirates and murderers to suave gentlemen  gamblers and their ladies of ill repute.  Yancy is sent out on undercover missions by  his boss.  Now for the bad news.  The show is boxed in  plastic case, two disk set inside each inside sleeve.  No book.  No listing.  Nothing.  No extras at all.  The episodes are listed on the disk but the disk are not numbereed so, unless you know the show you dont know which disk is 1 - 4. Jock also starred in the  show The Range Rider.
