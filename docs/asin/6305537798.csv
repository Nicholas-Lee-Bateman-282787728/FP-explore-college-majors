I'm not one for mushy love stories, or chick flicks, which this movie does fall into. Nor am I a fan of Shakespeare, but this movie is just so fun you can't help but love it.It was the movie that introduced Heath Ledger to America and is a teen classic. It also stares Julia Stiles, who is no stranger to chick flicks, Larissa Olenik(from one of my favourite Nick shows The Secret World of Alex Mack) and a few other people we know pretty well.The movie is based on the play The Taming of the Shrew, but it's set in a high school which brings it home for many people, not just teens. The acting is pretty good for a teen flick, and the dialogue followable without relying too much on teenspeak. The ending is pretty much already known, but still rather cute.This is a classic.

Any shot with the actors in the retrospective all are from when the movie was being made, nothing more current with any of the actors.Ridiculously stingy DVD extras aside, though, this is still something worth buying if you don't already own the movie.  It's definitely something that will go down amongst Clueless et al. as a great teen movie.  It's a fun, frothy (given credibility by that ""based on Will Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew"" line but frothy nonetheless) teen movie that doesn't condescend.  The script is just so well written!  The teenagers are written like, well, people I went to school with (which is saying something since I was in high school when this movie came out).  And the subtle jokes that appeared in this movie, well, it says something about the writers that they bothered with subtlety for a teen movie.  It's this earnest writing, rife with references to Shakespeare, that allows this movie to transcend beyond just another teen movie.The cast is wonderful, and it's amazing to think how many names I can easy recognize - Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Allison Janney, Gabrielle Union, etc.  Oh sure, it may have been the first big movie for many of these names, but they all showed why it was that they went on to have real careers after.All in all, it's worth buying if you don't own the movie but is not worth buying if you've got a copy hanging around.

468433,AK0CENM3LUM28,6305537798,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","10 Things I Hate About You / B00000K31Q*Spoiler*Loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"", ""10 Things"" is a very decent modern adaptation of this sometimes troublesome old tale. Faced with concepts that are difficult to translate to modern audiences, for instance why the desirable Bianca is off-limits until her abrasive sister Kat dates/marries in a world that no longer has bride prices and dowries, the film writers have created the clever conceit of a father obsessed with preventing his daughters from becoming grown, sexual beings. Tired of having the same argument with his social butterfly daughter Bianca, he childishly transfers the burden of parent onto the older Kat, saying that Bianca can date only when Kat does and trusting that Kat will continue to remain solitary and cloistered within the home.Neatly dodging questions of potential sexism in the original material, the abrasive Kat has been rendered as a superbly sympathetic character. From the beginning, it is clear that her tough exterior is not simply a factor of her being a terrible person, but rather it is a form of self-defense in the cruel world of high school politics. She is willing to open up to genuine kindness, but she refuses to be manipulated or used, and hopes to impart this wisdom somehow to her more vulnerable sister.Impressively, almost every character grows and learns something in this film. Kat and Patrick learn the value of trust and vulnerability in a relationship; Bianca and Cameron learn to judge when and how to be healthily selfish; and ""Dad"" learns to stop trying to prevent his daughters from growing up and to instead support them in such a way that he can still advise and guide them as they grow.Although this is a very good adaptation, it is arguable how 'timeless' ""10 Things"" is. High school is a naturally constraining setting, and high school rom-coms tend to age rather badly. Parents will want to note that this movie contains potentially objectionable language and situations involving alcohol and suggestive dancing. This version also contains captions for the hearing impaired.~ Ana Mardoll",4,Shakespeare Rom-Com,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,2123,"['10', 'Things', 'Hate', '/', 'B00000K31Q*Spoiler*Loosely', 'based', 'Shakespeare', 'Taming', 'Shrew', '10', 'Things', 'very', 'decent', 'modern', 'adaptation', 'troublesome', 'old', 'tale', 'Faced', 'concepts', 'are', 'difficult', 'translate', 'modern', 'audiences', 'instance', 'why', 'desirable', 'Bianca', 'off-limits', 'abrasive', 'sister', 'Kat', 'dates/marries', 'world', 'longer', 'bride', 'prices', 'dowries', 'film', 'writers', 'have', 'created', 'clever', 'conceit', 'father', 'obsessed', 'preventing', 'daughters', 'becoming', 'grown', 'sexual', 'beings', 'Tired', 'having', 'same', 'argument', 'social', 'butterfly', 'daughter', 'Bianca', 'transfers', 'burden', 'parent', 'older', 'Kat', 'saying', 'Bianca', 'can', 'date', 'only', 'when', 'Kat', 'trusting', 'Kat', 'will', 'continue', 'remain', 'solitary', 'cloistered', 'home.Neatly', 'dodging', 'questions', 'potential', 'sexism', 'original', 'material', 'abrasive', 'Kat', 'been', 'rendered', 'superbly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'beginning', 'clear', 'tough', 'exterior', 'not', 'simply', 'factor', 'being', 'terrible', 'person', 'rather', 'form', 'self-defense', 'cruel', 'world', 'high', 'school', 'politics', 'willing', 'open', 'up', 'genuine', 'kindness', 'be', 'manipulated', 'used', 'impart', 'wisdom', 'somehow', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'sister.Impressively', 'almost', 'character', 'grows', 'learns', 'something', 'film', 'Kat', 'Patrick', 'learn', 'value', 'trust', 'vulnerability', 'relationship', 'Bianca', 'Cameron', 'learn', 'judge', 'when', 'how', 'be', 'healthily', 'selfish', 'Dad', 'stop', 'trying', 'prevent', 'daughters', 'growing', 'up', 'instead', 'support', 'way', 'can', 'still', 'advise', 'guide', 'grow.Although', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'arguable', 'how', ""'timeless"", '10', 'Things', 'High', 'school', 'naturally', 'constraining', 'setting', 'high', 'school', 'rom-coms', 'tend', 'age', 'rather', 'badly', 'Parents', 'will', 'want', 'note', 'movie', 'potentially', 'objectionable', 'language', 'situations', 'involving', 'alcohol', 'suggestive', 'dancing', 'version', 'also', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

The script is very witty, even to the point of being really good, but the developement of its characters is sadly lacking. Heath Ledger's character, Patrick Verona (the male lead), goes too easily from &quot;tough and scary&quot; to &quot;sweet and sensitive&quot;, without anything to make us believe it. Since the dialogue shows no evidence of his being in love with Kat (Julia Stiles) until he comes out and says it, it's rather hard to believe. Juliat Stiles character has a similiar problem, going from &quot;grumpy loner&quot; to &quot;happy teen&quot; in hardly a blink. Of course, one hardly notices due to these young actors supurb preformances.The co-stars steal the show, however. The bumbling new kid who falls for the sweet and popular, if a little shallow, Bianca (Kat's sister) is so likable I wish the story focused on him and all his troubles, and his quirky new friend has some great lines. Allison Janey is wonderful and often provides great comic relief among some flat jokes.A great movie, worth watching more then once.

Yes, the immortal bard had a hand in this one but the writers, actors and director put it on the screen as more than a simple modified Shakespeare play.8: Unpatronizing high school scenario. Often with movies like this, where the set is the local high school, you feel as a viewer that you've been taken hostage and imprisoned.  Not so with this one.  It's about kids in high school but there is so much in the characters that it's easy to see it more as a gathering of interesting individuals than a high school story.7. A great adult supporting cast! Too often in movies like this the adults are portrayed as nothing more than brainless morons. Performances here by Larry Miller (Mr. Walter Stratford), Daryl Mitchell (Mr. Morgan), Allison Janney (Ms. Perky) and David Leisure (Mr. Chapin) are hilarious. Crazy, yes, but they don't play second fiddle to any of the teenagers.6. Andrew Keegan. Keegan plays the airheaded, self-absorbed Joey Donner, the delusional ""King of the Campus."" Keegan is so good that you'll absolutely love hating him.5. David Krumholtz. The deadpan actor who came to the screen as Bernard, the elf, in THE SANTA CLAUSE, is terrific as a campus nerd, Michael Eckman who accepts his place while showing that he is really the one in-the-know.4. Larisa Oleynik is wonderful as the spoiled and nave Bianca Stratford. While it would be easy to take the role south as an abysmal airhead, Oleynik is delightfully on the level, inexperienced but not stupid.3. Joseph Gordon-Levitt. JGL, late of classics like A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD and THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN is absolutely irresistible as Cameron James, the new kid on campus who is befriended by Michael Eckman. The story revolves around his efforts to win the heart of Bianca Stratford.2. Julia Stiles is surprisingly good as the Bianca's antisocial older sister, Katarina ""Kat"" Stratford, and1.

468436,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305537798,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","One of my favorite teen comedies would have to be '10 Things I Hate About You', a film that remains hilarious and smart as each year passes.  The dialog is snappy and sincere and the acting is really top notch for a teen film, every actor in perfect unison and really in tune with their character.  As far as modern adaptations of Shakespearian novels go (and there are tons of them as we are all well aware) this is one of the better ones.  It stays true to the concept of the original `Taming of the Shrew' but adds enough clever twists that make this original and a lot of fun.  The chemistry between the actors is wonderful, and for a film staring a group of young actors it's one of the only films to star a group of `talented' young actors, from recent Oscar nominee Heath Ledger to Oscar snubbed Joseph Gordon-Levitt.The plot of the film follows Cameron, played by Gordon-Levitt, as he pines for the attention of Bianca, played by Larisa Oleynik.  The problem Cameron faces is not the fact that she's one of the most popular girls in school, and way out of his league but the fact that her father refuses to let her date.  His stipulation is that her older sister Kat begin dating first, and Kat is not about to do that anytime soon.  Cameron decides his only option is to find a suitor for Kat, someone to sweep her off her feet, problem being that everyone at the school is afraid of Kat.  She's abrasive, rude and has made it perfectly clear that she has no interest in boys.  But Cameron finds Patrick Verona, the mysterious tough guy with no fears, and offers him cash to take out Kat.  Thus the hunt begins.  Patrick finds it more difficult than expected to woo Kat but as he attempts he finds that his original disinterest in her is turning to genuine infatuation and then to a more mature caring and concern.  He's falling in love with her and surprisingly she's falling for him as well.All four of the main stars work wonders with their characters.  Oleynik is sweet, funny and realistic as Bianca.  I remember watching her on Nickelodeon's `The Secret World of Alex Mack' and thinking she had that natural talent, of course I was twelve but whatever.  Here she doesn't disappoint, even now that I'm much older than twelve.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great here, really natural.  He's matured into such a wonderful actor and his selection in films is wonderfully eclectic.  Julia Stiles also blew me away here.  I've always been a fan of her acting, she's charming and beautiful to look at, but her she shows layers of depth and reality to a character that could have easily become surface in the hands of another actress.  She truly deserves a better career than the one she has.  And talking about better careers, look no further than the standout performer of the bunch Heath Ledger.  Before `Brokeback Mountain' he was the one to watch for.  Here he's charming, natural, charismatic, funny and definitely ahead of the pack as far as natural talent is concerned.  I'm so proud of him as an actor.The supporting players are all great as well, from Larry Miller who plays the girls paranoid father (that whole scene with the pregnant crack addict story is priceless) to Allison Janney who plays the sex obsessed guidance councilor, everyone is on the top of their game.  But ultimately this is a teen movie, about and for teens and so I need to make mention of the supporting actors playing teens (I say `playing' because I'm sure most of them are in their twenties/thirties as is almost always the case).  David Khumoltz is effective in the geeky sidekick role, but it's Andrew Keegan who shines as popular, too cool for his own good, cocky jerk Joey.  He's utterly hilarious in his role which could have gone the route of stock character but instead stepped out from the pack and became a very memorable part of the film.  That whole scene with the two pictures was genius.  With a tight script and an effective cast '10 Things I Hate About You' should prove to be an enjoyable movie experience, one for the textbooks!",5,There is nothing to hate about this smart and clever teen comedy...,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,4035,"['One', 'favorite', 'teen', 'comedies', 'would', 'have', 'be', ""'10"", 'Things', 'Hate', 'film', 'hilarious', 'smart', 'year', 'dialog', 'snappy', 'sincere', 'acting', 'really', 'top', 'notch', 'teen', 'film', 'actor', 'perfect', 'unison', 'really', 'tune', 'character', 'As', 'far', 'modern', 'adaptations', 'Shakespearian', 'novels', 'go', 'are', 'tons', 'are', 'well', 'aware', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'true', 'concept', 'original', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'enough', 'clever', 'twists', 'make', 'original', 'lot', 'fun', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'wonderful', 'film', 'staring', 'group', 'young', 'actors', 'one', 'only', 'films', 'star', 'group', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', 'recent', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Oscar', 'snubbed', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt.The', 'plot', 'film', 'Cameron', 'played', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'attention', 'Bianca', 'played', 'Larisa', 'Oleynik', 'problem', 'Cameron', 'not', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'girls', 'school', 'way', 'league', 'fact', 'father', 'let', 'date', 'stipulation', 'older', 'sister', 'Kat', 'begin', 'dating', 'first', 'Kat', 'not', 'do', 'anytime', 'soon', 'Cameron', 'only', 'option', 'find', 'suitor', 'Kat', 'someone', 'sweep', 'feet', 'problem', 'being', 'everyone', 'school', 'afraid', 'Kat', 'abrasive', 'rude', 'made', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'interest', 'boys', 'Cameron', 'Patrick', 'Verona', 'mysterious', 'tough', 'guy', 'fears', 'cash', 'take', 'out', 'Kat', 'Thus', 'hunt', 'Patrick', 'more', 'difficult', 'expected', 'woo', 'Kat', 'original', 'disinterest', 'turning', 'genuine', 'infatuation', 'then', 'more', 'mature', 'caring', 'concern', 'falling', 'love', 'surprisingly', 'falling', 'well.All', 'four', 'main', 'stars', 'work', 'wonders', 'characters', 'Oleynik', 'sweet', 'funny', 'realistic', 'Bianca', 'remember', 'watching', 'Nickelodeon', 'Secret', 'World', 'Alex', 'Mack', 'thinking', 'had', 'natural', 'talent', 'course', 'was', 'twelve', 'whatever', 'Here', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'even', 'now', ""'m"", 'much', 'older', 'twelve', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'great', 'here', 'really', 'natural', 'matured', 'such', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'selection', 'films', 'wonderfully', 'eclectic', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'also', 'blew', 'away', 'here', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'acting', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'look', 'layers', 'depth', 'reality', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'become', 'surface', 'hands', 'actress', 'truly', 'better', 'career', 'one', 'talking', 'better', 'careers', 'look', 'further', 'standout', 'performer', 'bunch', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'one', 'watch', 'Here', 'charming', 'natural', 'charismatic', 'funny', 'definitely', 'ahead', 'pack', 'as', 'far', 'natural', 'talent', 'concerned', ""'m"", 'so', 'proud', 'actor.The', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'all', 'great', 'well', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'who', 'girls', 'paranoid', 'father', 'whole', 'scene', 'pregnant', 'crack', 'addict', 'story', 'priceless', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'who', 'sex', 'obsessed', 'guidance', 'councilor', 'everyone', 'top', 'game', 'ultimately', 'teen', 'movie', 'about', 'teens', 'so', 'need', 'make', 'mention', 'supporting', 'actors', 'playing', 'teens', 'say', 'playing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'are', 'twenties/thirties', 'almost', 'always', 'case', 'David', 'Khumoltz', 'effective', 'geeky', 'sidekick', 'role', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', 'who', 'popular', 'too', 'cool', 'own', 'good', 'cocky', 'jerk', 'Joey', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'route', 'stock', 'character', 'instead', 'stepped', 'out', 'pack', 'became', 'very', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'whole', 'scene', 'two', 'pictures', 'was', 'genius', 'tight', 'script', 'effective', 'cast', 'Things', 'Hate', 'should', 'prove', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'experience', 'one', 'textbooks']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

This is one I really like. I was pleasantly surprised when I first saw this cute, charming movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt(""3rd Rock From The Sun"") plays Cameron. He has moved to Seattle and is the new kid in school. He quickly befriends a geek(David Krumholtz from ""The Santa Clause""), who gives him the run down of the school and it's students. Cameron falls madly in love with Bianca Stratford(Larissa Oleynick, who, coincidentally, played his girlfriend for a while on ""3rd Rock""). Bianca is a the quintessential popular, beloved, rich girl who is untouchable. Cameron makes it his mission to get to her. Then there is Bianca's sister Kat(Julia Stiles). She is the 'Anti-Bianca'. She is tough, sharp mouthed, and generally hates people. Their dad, who is played the always watchable Larry Miller, makes a deal with his daughters. Bianca can date as soon as Kat does. Bianca is upset because Kat doesn't want to date. This begins Cameron's mission. He and his friend enlist a tough, brooding guy named Patrick(Heath Ledger)to start wooing Kat, for cash, supplied by empty, pretty boy Joey(Andrew Keegan of ""7th Heaven"").If he succeeds, then Cameron can date Bianca. Naturally, things get complicated and awful before they can get better and work out for everyone involved. The film is based on William Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew"". Julia Stiles was first noticed with this film. There is something so intoxicating about her. She has a special quality to her that is irresistable. Her smile is a wondrous thing. She is a star. The movie is very funny, and surprisingly funny in some ways. The dialogue is pretty clever, sharp, and well written. It is head and shoulders above most teen comedies of the last decade. The actors are all well suited for their roles and are enjoyable to watch. Larissa Oleynick is as cute as a bug. Allison Janney from ""The West Wing"" has a hilarious, but all too brief role as the school's guidance councelor who is in the middle of writing a trashy sex novel. David Leisure also appears as the gym teacher. It is unfair that this movie has to have the tag of ""teen movie"" attached to it. To some people, that equals poison. Especially in this day and age. I'm telling you right now people, this movie is better than that. This is enjoyable for any age. It's funny, cute, and has more depth and intelligence than most of these movies combined. If only all teen movies of this modern era could be as delightful as this one.

468451,A2Q5PDCSQ1JSF1,6305537798,Benjamin Scott,"[2, 3]","I watched this movie on a late night after my little brother had rented it. I had nothing better to do and thought I would content myself with vacuous young stars and their pointless starring vehicle. I was pleasantly  surprised.Apart from more than a few scenes which inspired more groans  than anything else, some token ridiculous and bit characters, and some  harsh cliches the movie is not altogether terrible. The idea of it being  based on &quot;The Taming of the Shrew,&quot; though, is a complete  fallacy. It is as much an adaptation of that piece of Shakespeare as  &quot;U-571&quot; was an adaptation of &quot;Das Boot&quot; (and at least  both of those had submarines!). But amid the rapping of Shakespeare and  ridiculous attempts at physical comedy (not to mention the blatant blending  of two distinctly separate cities; Stadium High School is NOT in the middle  of Queen Anne, Seattle)there is the occasional surprising scene. For  instance, the initial jabs at teenage social structures are moderately  intelligent as are some of the views espoused by the angry teacher. But  some of the funniest gems from the piece lie in the almost perfect satire  of American high school students and their social structures.For the  most part, however, the movie does not deviate from the standard teen fare.  For virtually every good bit of the movie there is a corresponding bad  piece. The acting falls somewhere between &quot;She's All That&quot; and  &quot;American Pie&quot; as does the story line. The characters cannot seem  to actually stay characters but this is a failing on the part of the  screenwriters.My recommendation is this: watch this if you've got a few  spare and otherwise boring hours and a free rental somewhere.",2,Surprisingly funny but severely lacking in &quot;adaptation&quot;,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,1742,"['watched', 'movie', 'late', 'night', 'little', 'brother', 'had', 'rented', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'thought', 'would', 'content', 'vacuous', 'young', 'stars', 'pointless', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Apart', 'more', 'few', 'scenes', 'inspired', 'more', 'groans', 'anything', 'else', 'token', 'ridiculous', 'bit', 'characters', 'harsh', 'cliches', 'movie', 'not', 'altogether', 'terrible', 'idea', 'being', 'based', 'quot', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'quot', 'complete', 'fallacy', 'as', 'much', 'adaptation', 'piece', 'Shakespeare', 'quot', 'U-571', 'quot', 'was', 'adaptation', 'quot', 'Das', 'Boot', 'quot', 'least', 'had', 'submarines', 'rapping', 'Shakespeare', 'ridiculous', 'attempts', 'physical', 'comedy', 'not', 'mention', 'blatant', 'blending', 'two', 'distinctly', 'separate', 'cities', 'Stadium', 'High', 'School', 'NOT', 'middle', 'Queen', 'Anne', 'Seattle', 'occasional', 'surprising', 'scene', 'instance', 'initial', 'jabs', 'teenage', 'social', 'structures', 'are', 'moderately', 'intelligent', 'are', 'views', 'espoused', 'angry', 'teacher', 'funniest', 'gems', 'piece', 'lie', 'almost', 'perfect', 'satire', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'social', 'structures.For', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'movie', 'not', 'deviate', 'standard', 'teen', 'fare', 'virtually', 'good', 'bit', 'movie', 'corresponding', 'bad', 'piece', 'acting', 'falls', 'somewhere', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'actually', 'stay', 'characters', 'failing', 'part', 'screenwriters.My', 'recommendation', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'got', 'few', 'spare', 'otherwise', 'boring', 'hours', 'free', 'rental', 'somewhere']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

From Patrick singing across the football field to Kat to Bianca ditching the pretty-boy Joey for the newbie, unpopular, Cameron, for some reason it all works perfectly. I'm convinced the reason this film is so good and is able to carry such a worn plot is because of the cast. Julia Styles and Heath Ledger are really convincing as a couple and, oddly enough, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larisa Oleynik also seem to work wonderfully together.The plot revolves around five characters. Basically, Cameron and his school-showing guide/friend concieve this idea to get a rich guy named Joey to pay Patrick to date Kat, so that Cameron can date Kat's younger sister, Bianca. Cliches and chaos ensues!10 Things... is your average boy gets girl/boy loses girl/boy gets girl back movie, times two since there's two relationships blossoming.

468458,A3TUE4JZMN4HYO,6305537798,"Brian Martin ""foliowyrm""","[3, 3]","Of all the recent teen romantic comedies, I think this one is my favorite.  ""10 Things"" is (losely) based on Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew.""  The movie is about Kat (the Shrew) who is a anti social outsider.  Unfortunately her younger and more popular sister Bianca cannot date until Kat starts dating.  Various suitors of Bianca's conspire to free her by hiring the school bad boy Patrick to date Kat.I love the fact that both the lead characters are somewhat outsiders in high school, rather than following usual story arc for a teen romance where at least one of the leads is part of the ""in crowd.""  The character of Kat is also very refreshing.  She is a strong willed and feminist, but remains sexy and human rather than a Hollywood sterotype.I also loved the setting of the movie in Seattle, Washington.  What a departure from the vast majority of teen movies which usually take place in California!  I especially like the school where the film was shot, which is a real High School in Tacoma.  Compared to where I went to high school, the school in this film is absolutely sureal and it definately gives a certain feeling of fantasy to the movie.Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are perfect as the leads.  Both were very young when this movie was filmed, but you could tell then they had talent and would go far.  Julia Stiles really impresses with her ability to be sexy, strong and even vulnerable all at the same time.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Larisa Olenik gives a great performance as the beautiful and naive Bianca.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Cameron, the boy who will do anything for Bianca. I also liked Andrew Keegan as the vain and vapid Joey who also is after Bianca, but for less than honorable reasons.The movie does have some cliche's of the teen comedy genre, but the story is surprisingly clever and engaging, the characters are charming, and the setting in Seattle is fantastic and fresh.

This movie is a half star better than ""She's All That"".Kat and Bianca live with their father, an OB/GYN, whose wife left him. He is raising his daughters alone. He's very caring father, though very strick both because of his profession and his abandonment by his wife.Bianca, who is younger than Kat and a certified flirt, is not allowed by her father to date unless Kat is dating.  But Kat refuses to date anyone. She is cynical and unhappy though it is obvious that she is very intelligent (much more so than Bianca). She's very unpopular at school; even her English teacher doesn't like her. Something has happened to Kat to make her cynical and bitter, but what?  We find out much later in the film.Cameron, who has been tutoring Bianca in French, is infatuated with Bianca and wants to date her. He and his friend Michael (a geeky kind of guy) devise a scheme to find a date for Kat. No one will accept their proposal except Patrick who is the most unpopular tough-guy/loner at the high school (he lights his cigarettes with a blow torch in one scene). The school rumor is that Patrick was in prison at one time. Though frightened of Patrick, they approach him and convince Patrick to work on getting a date with Kat by tricking Joey, an egotistical guy with plenty of money who also wants to date Bianca, into bribing Patrick.It takes Patrick quite a while to make it through the wall Kat has thrown up to keep everyone at arms length. Kat hates Patrick at first but his persistence pays off.The scenes between Patrick and Kat, as their relationship develops, are charming. My favorite scenes are the book store scene, Patrick's tenderness to Kat after she gets herself drunk at a party, the paint ball scene, the music store scene, and most especially the scene where Patrick sings to Kat from the bleachers while she is in gym class playing soccer.Why did I give this movie 4 stars if I liked it so much? Because this movie is an very loose adaptation based on Shakespeare's play ""The Taming of the Shrew"". In comparison with ""Clueless"", another teen romance movie which is a loose adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Emma"", this movie falls just short of the perfection of ""Clueless"". If ""Clueless"" is a 5 star movie, then this one must be a 4 star movie.",4,A very good teen romance movie,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,2393,"['like', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'reviewer', 'would', 'compare', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'movie', 'half', 'star', 'better', '.Kat', 'Bianca', 'live', 'father', 'OB/GYN', 'wife', 'left', 'raising', 'daughters', 'alone', 'very', 'caring', 'father', 'though', 'very', 'strick', 'profession', 'abandonment', 'wife.Bianca', 'who', 'younger', 'Kat', 'certified', 'flirt', 'not', 'allowed', 'father', 'date', 'Kat', 'dating', 'Kat', 'date', 'anyone', 'cynical', 'unhappy', 'obvious', 'very', 'intelligent', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Bianca', 'very', 'unpopular', 'school', 'even', 'English', 'teacher', ""n't"", 'like', 'Something', 'happened', 'Kat', 'make', 'cynical', 'bitter', 'what', 'find', 'out', 'much', 'later', 'film.Cameron', 'who', 'been', 'tutoring', 'Bianca', 'French', 'infatuated', 'Bianca', 'date', 'friend', 'Michael', 'geeky', 'kind', 'guy', 'devise', 'scheme', 'find', 'date', 'Kat', 'one', 'will', 'accept', 'proposal', 'Patrick', 'who', 'most', 'unpopular', 'tough-guy/loner', 'high', 'school', 'cigarettes', 'blow', 'torch', 'one', 'scene', 'school', 'rumor', 'Patrick', 'was', 'prison', 'one', 'time', 'Though', 'frightened', 'Patrick', 'approach', 'convince', 'Patrick', 'work', 'getting', 'date', 'Kat', 'tricking', 'Joey', 'egotistical', 'guy', 'plenty', 'money', 'who', 'also', 'date', 'Bianca', 'bribing', 'Patrick.It', 'Patrick', 'quite', 'while', 'make', 'wall', 'Kat', 'thrown', 'up', 'keep', 'everyone', 'arms', 'length', 'Kat', 'Patrick', 'first', 'persistence', 'off.The', 'scenes', 'Patrick', 'Kat', 'relationship', 'are', 'charming', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'book', 'store', 'scene', 'Patrick', 'tenderness', 'Kat', 'drunk', 'party', 'paint', 'ball', 'scene', 'music', 'store', 'scene', 'most', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'Patrick', 'Kat', 'bleachers', 'gym', 'class', 'playing', 'soccer.Why', 'did', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'very', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'based', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'comparison', 'Clueless', 'teen', 'romance', 'movie', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Emma', 'movie', 'just', 'short', 'perfection', 'Clueless', 'Clueless', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'then', 'one', 'must', 'be', '4', 'star', 'movie']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

In no particular order.1) It is a teen movie but NOT a teen movie2) The way Shakespeare is thrown in every so often so that it connects to the original writer of the play. Patrick Verona (where most of Will's plays are set), the school is a character. Mandala's hapless and hopeless obsession with him 'we are one'as she puts it3) I am not a feminist, but Kat played one kick[ing]girl for her time.4) How well the movie was adapted by Gil Junger from the play. Original plot and even lines! were in the movie5) Incredible likeable actors. Both estetically pleasing, Heath and Julia are great actors. Considering it was Heath's first role, he stood out incredible.6) The 'witty repartee' of the movie. How could anyone not like the line ""Am I that transparent? I need you, I want you, oh baby, oh baby"".7) The smooth dialogue throughout the movie. Very quick responses from each character8) The secondary characters never lacked screen time and were not made to look like supporting characters9) How well the actors cemented their roles to how good old William protrayed the characters way back when. Really, you would think it was Shakespearen actors trying to invent 'our days'10) The moral issues it comes out with. The pregnancy suit that Bianca has to wear. No smoking, no drinking (except when Kat shows her 'stunning digestive pyrotechnics'.And in true 10 Things fashion, I had one four more. See number 12 to understand my reasoning.11) Mrs. Perky12) The end when Julia recites the poem that is obviously written about her love interest, Patrick Verona. The ironic part of it, there are 14 things she mentions she hates, not 10. Count it, you will see that I am right.13) The music that fit into every scene. From Club Skunk to the prom to when Patricka and Kat play paint ball.14) How finally, the slimy bad guy who was after Bianca got decked.",5,10 Things I Love About This Movie,1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,1890,"['reasons', 'why', 'love', 'movie', 'particular', 'order.1', 'teen', 'movie', 'NOT', 'teen', 'movie2', 'way', 'Shakespeare', 'thrown', 'so', 'often', 'original', 'writer', 'play', 'Patrick', 'Verona', 'where', 'most', 'Will', 'plays', 'are', 'set', 'school', 'character', 'Mandala', 'hapless', 'hopeless', 'obsession', 'are', ""one'as"", 'it3', 'am', 'not', 'feminist', 'Kat', 'played', 'one', 'kick', '[', 'ing', ']', 'girl', 'time.4', 'How', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'Gil', 'Junger', 'play', 'Original', 'plot', 'even', 'lines', 'were', 'movie5', 'Incredible', 'likeable', 'actors', 'estetically', 'pleasing', 'Heath', 'Julia', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'Considering', 'was', 'Heath', 'first', 'role', 'stood', 'out', 'incredible.6', ""'witty"", 'repartee', 'movie', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'not', 'line', 'Am', 'transparent', 'need', 'want', 'oh', 'baby', 'oh', 'baby', '.7', 'smooth', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'Very', 'quick', 'responses', 'character8', 'secondary', 'characters', 'never', 'lacked', 'screen', 'time', 'were', 'not', 'made', 'look', 'supporting', 'characters9', 'How', 'well', 'actors', 'cemented', 'roles', 'how', 'good', 'old', 'William', 'protrayed', 'characters', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Really', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'Shakespearen', 'actors', 'trying', 'invent', ""'our"", ""days'10"", 'moral', 'issues', 'out', 'pregnancy', 'suit', 'Bianca', 'wear', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'when', 'Kat', ""'stunning"", 'digestive', ""pyrotechnics'.And"", 'true', '10', 'Things', 'fashion', 'had', 'one', 'four', 'more', 'See', 'number', '12', 'understand', 'reasoning.11', 'Mrs.', 'Perky12', 'end', 'when', 'Julia', 'poem', 'obviously', 'written', 'love', 'interest', 'Patrick', 'Verona', 'ironic', 'part', 'are', '14', 'things', 'not', '10', 'Count', 'will', 'see', 'am', 'right.13', 'music', 'fit', 'scene', 'Club', 'Skunk', 'prom', 'when', 'Patricka', 'Kat', 'play', 'paint', 'ball.14', 'How', 'finally', 'slimy', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'Bianca', 'got', 'decked']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

468465,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,6305537798,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[0, 0]","Really, ""10 Things"" was so dry, witty - and yet so sharply observant about high school and the denizens within, it's almost as if it were another John Hughes movie, ten years after. Now it's another ten years after that, and it has aged marvelously well, all things considered; even the minor characters are sharply drawn, and if not actually sympathetic, they are amusing. One of the best qualities about ""10 Things"" is that the adult characters are also real people, not just cardboard outlines and sappy caricatures: they are as sharp and finely drawn as the teenagers - especially Alison Janney as the no-nonsense guidance counselor at Padua High, who is writing a bodice-ripping romance in between counseling sessions, and the lovingly over-protective father of teenage daughters, played by Larry Miller.The plot setup is lifted wholesale from Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"" - two sisters, Bianca, (Larisa Oleynik) sweet and pretty, and her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) being a forbiddingly hostile and sour-tempered shrew.  Cameron, the new boy at Padua High (Joseph Gordon Levitt) has fallen for Bianca - who may not go out on a date unless her sister does the same. Not discouraged, Cameron attempts to fix up Kat with a slightly mysterious, brooding bad boy, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger)  . . .  and it pretty much plays out, among the modern high school milieu of various sub-groups, which are hilariously outlined by Cameron's new friend and assistant plotter, Michael (David Khumoltz). Just as I remember from high school, there are the brains, the social set, the stoners, the gangsters, the bad boys, all of them uneasily coexisting. Sweet, funny, timeless and with a million things going on in the corners and in the background, ""10 Things"" can bear watching, repeatedly - like John Hughes movies.Extras are limited to a single fairly well organized documentary, ""10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later,"" which includes - among the cast and writer interviews - some footage of Heath Ledger's screen test.",5,A John Hughes Sort of Movie,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,2035,"['Really', '10', 'Things', 'was', 'so', 'dry', 'witty', 'yet', 'so', 'sharply', 'observant', 'high', 'school', 'denizens', 'almost', 'were', 'John', 'Hughes', 'movie', 'ten', 'years', 'Now', 'ten', 'years', 'aged', 'marvelously', 'well', 'things', 'considered', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'sharply', 'drawn', 'not', 'actually', 'sympathetic', 'are', 'amusing', 'One', 'best', 'qualities', '10', 'Things', 'adult', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'cardboard', 'outlines', 'sappy', 'caricatures', 'are', 'sharp', 'finely', 'drawn', 'teenagers', 'especially', 'Alison', 'Janney', 'no-nonsense', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Padua', 'High', 'who', 'writing', 'bodice-ripping', 'romance', 'counseling', 'sessions', 'lovingly', 'over-protective', 'father', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'played', 'Larry', 'Miller.The', 'plot', 'setup', 'lifted', 'wholesale', 'Shakespeare', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'two', 'sisters', 'Bianca', 'Larisa', 'Oleynik', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'older', 'sister', 'Kat', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'being', 'forbiddingly', 'hostile', 'sour-tempered', 'shrew', 'Cameron', 'new', 'boy', 'Padua', 'High', 'Joseph', 'Gordon', 'Levitt', 'fallen', 'Bianca', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'date', 'sister', 'same', 'Not', 'discouraged', 'Cameron', 'fix', 'up', 'Kat', 'slightly', 'mysterious', 'brooding', 'bad', 'boy', 'Patrick', 'Verona', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'pretty', 'much', 'out', 'modern', 'high', 'school', 'milieu', 'various', 'sub-groups', 'are', 'hilariously', 'outlined', 'Cameron', 'new', 'friend', 'assistant', 'plotter', 'Michael', 'David', 'Khumoltz', 'Just', 'remember', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'brains', 'social', 'set', 'stoners', 'gangsters', 'bad', 'boys', 'uneasily', 'coexisting', 'Sweet', 'funny', 'timeless', 'million', 'things', 'going', 'corners', 'background', '10', 'Things', 'can', 'bear', 'watching', 'repeatedly', 'John', 'Hughes', 'movies.Extras', 'are', 'limited', 'single', 'fairly', 'well', 'organized', 'documentary', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', '10', 'Years', 'Later', 'cast', 'writer', 'interviews', 'footage', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'screen', 'test']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

468467,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,6305537798,Charity Bishop,"[0, 0]","High school. Some of us remember it with fond memories, but the rest look on it as some of the worst years of their lives. Dating, dealing with cheerleaders, jocks, math club addicts, and problematic teachers. That's most of what we remember about high school. 10 Things I Hate About You is a likable film, but takes awhile in getting there, and in the meantime, reminds us of the worst of our high school rejection years.Every boy in the school believes that Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) is ""all that."" Pretty, popular, and currently single due to her father's no-dating standards, she is desired by most of the guys that walk the hallowed halls of the local high school. The newest batch to the group of pining admirers is Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose recent move into the district has caused him to immediately start scheming on how to get close to her. Taking up French tutoring just so he can be around her, he is turned down flat when he asks for a date, because her uptight father will not allow it. When Bianca takes her concerns to her dad, he makes an agreement -- once her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) starts dating, so can Bianca.One of the most trouble-driven brats in the school, Kat's ultra feminism and outspoken nature has made her unpopular with not only the entire male population but most of her teachers as well. The only student even capable of potentially handling her is the rebel of the class, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). But he's not willing to do something for nothing, and so Cameron and his friend Michael (David Krumholtz) trick money-stuffed jock Joey (Andrew Keegan) into financing this venture, convincing him it would be in his best interest if he intends to ever date Bianca. Thus the price is set at $50 per date, and Patrick has an uphill battle before him. Bianca has never looked on any man without disgust, and he has to win her over before the prom. This isn't much like any high school that I passed through as a teen. The teachers are rude to the students and inconsiderate of their opinions. The principle spends most of her time writing smut fiction, and bawling out the kids with foul language.The movie just seems to hop from one horrible thing to another, before gradually slowing down and allowing the audience to come to like its protagonists. That being said, I cannot really recommend it because there is an abhorrent amount of sexual dialogue and jokes deflowering the script. Joey likes drawing certain parts of the anatomy for fun, including sketching a penis on a boy's face. Mr. Stratford works in a maternity ward, leading him to be obsessed with the possibility that his daughters might be having sex. The principle recites the dirty novel she is writing aloud as she's working on it. In an attempt to distract a teacher so her boyfriend can escape detention, Kat flashes him. Attending a party where alcohol runs feely, Kat becomes intoxicated and dances on a table. There's quite a lot of mild language and sexual/anatomical references. Before letting his daughter go out on a date, her father makes her wear a ""pregnancy suit"" to remind her of the consequences of premarital sex.

Middleton,"[4, 8]","This is a well produced teenage-formula film, and for the genre, particulaly entertaining for young adults because it touches on issues such as relationships, the frustrations of young adolescence with great looking actors and a great soundtrack.The screenwriter's suggest that the movie is a modern rendition of ""The Taming of the Shrew"", a Shakespearean comedy, a story about the taming of a bad tempered ""in your face"" young woman into submission.As far as the film's connections to Shakespear's play, there are few.Watching the film again, there are only a small number of connections and they are vague at best; connections one can count on one hand.We have a bad tempered young woman and a suitor with a goal. There is a bet, something about ""taming"" the Shrew, but really, that's about it.The theme of the film is about attaining ""true love"", against seemingly unbeatable odds. However, Shakespear's play is about ""taming"" a woman, a nasty shrew, bending Katharine to Petruchio's will! Altogether entirely different themes.In the original play, Petruchio sees Katharine as a challenge, and once given her hand in marriage, abuses her into submission through starvation and intimidation.At the play's end, there is a ""bet"" between the men on whose wife is the most obedient.Petruchio wins the bet because he has essentially bullied Katherine into  an obedient, submissive wife.All said and done, this film is an entertaining teenage collection of clich&eacute;s' which really is designed to hold the attention of a young audience.Ten Things...is musically a good buzz, most the actors performing tongue and cheek with a typical, feel-good Hollywood ending.My only complaint, really, is the alleged connections to the 16th century play...because there is no substantial comparison...For a teenage movie, however, one of the better one's.",3,Shrew it is Not,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,1842,"['well', 'produced', 'teenage-formula', 'film', 'genre', 'particulaly', 'entertaining', 'young', 'adults', 'issues', 'such', 'relationships', 'frustrations', 'young', 'adolescence', 'great', 'looking', 'actors', 'great', 'soundtrack.The', 'screenwriter', 'suggest', 'movie', 'modern', 'rendition', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Shakespearean', 'comedy', 'story', 'taming', 'bad', 'tempered', 'face', 'young', 'woman', 'submission.As', 'far', 'film', 'connections', 'Shakespear', 'play', 'are', 'few.Watching', 'film', 'again', 'are', 'only', 'small', 'number', 'connections', 'are', 'vague', 'best', 'connections', 'one', 'can', 'count', 'one', 'hand.We', 'have', 'bad', 'tempered', 'young', 'woman', 'suitor', 'goal', 'bet', 'something', 'taming', 'Shrew', 'really', 'it.The', 'theme', 'film', 'attaining', 'true', 'love', 'seemingly', 'unbeatable', 'odds', 'However', 'Shakespear', 'play', 'taming', 'woman', 'nasty', 'shrew', 'bending', 'Katharine', 'Petruchio', 'will', 'Altogether', 'entirely', 'different', 'original', 'play', 'Petruchio', 'Katharine', 'challenge', 'once', 'given', 'hand', 'marriage', 'submission', 'starvation', 'intimidation.At', 'play', 'end', 'bet', 'men', 'wife', 'most', 'obedient.Petruchio', 'bet', 'essentially', 'bullied', 'Katherine', 'obedient', 'submissive', 'wife.All', 'said', 'done', 'film', 'entertaining', 'teenage', 'collection', 'clich', 'eacute', 'really', 'designed', 'hold', 'attention', 'young', 'audience.Ten', 'Things', 'musically', 'good', 'buzz', 'most', 'actors', 'performing', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'typical', 'feel-good', 'Hollywood', 'ending.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'really', 'alleged', 'connections', '16th', 'century', 'play', 'substantial', 'comparison', 'teenage', 'movie', 'however', 'one', 'better', 'one']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

468478,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305537798,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 8]","No matter how old I get, I'll never be too old to enjoy a good teen movie.  Yes, it's rather formulaic, but 10 Things I Hate About You is smart and funny and more intelligent than your average teen comedy.  It also stars Julia Styles, which is a definite plus in my book.  I can't say my high school was anything like Padua High (how many high schools take place in a huge castle?), and I certainly never had an English teacher like the one teaching here, but every high school is pretty much the same when it comes to cliques, romances, misunderstandings, sibling rivalries, and the like.  One of the things I really liked about this film is the fact that it didn't break down according to the overused formula of rich kids vs. poor kids and never the twain shall meet (unless you're, say, Molly Ringwald).It's true that this film is loosely inspired by Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, but don't make too much of that.  How many teens would even know what a shrew is?  Personally, I don't look at Kat Stratford (Julia Styles) as a shrew; she's just a bitter, disillusioned teen who can't stand the thought of doing what is expected of her - and she does have reasons for taking on this persona.  Her sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is her exact opposite, a vivacious girl who just wants to be a normal teenager.  Her problem is the girls' overprotective father, who refuses to let Bianca date until Kat starts dating (which doesn't look like it will be happening any time soon given Kat's nature).  The new kid in school, Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is smitten with Bianca, and he puts together a plan to make her date-eligible by having someone else take out her sister - ingeniously using the school's pitifully shallow cool guy (and Bianca admirer) as the middle man.  The chosen one is the school's mysterious new tough guy, who has to earn the money he's being paid to win the reluctant Kat over.  Obviously, he ends up falling for the girl, which puts everything in place for the predictable conclusion.  Will Kat and the designated dater become a couple, or will everything explode in the guy's face?  Will Bianca ever win the right to get out of the house and spread her perkiness all around?  And who will Bianca choose - the hot, brainless Mr. Cool or Cameron, the nice boy who looks like he should still be in junior high?  And, since she's already taller than the guy, will Bianca ever stop putting her hair up when she goes out with him?Clich&eacute;s abound, but the script really is rather witty.  For those keeping score at home, the film does feature one wild dance party and the required minimum of one barfing scene, but it never crosses the line into a completely dumb teen comedy.  10 Things I Hate About You isn't quite as good as the classic John Hughes films of the 1980s, but it's easily better than most of the teen films produced in recent years.  With its PG-13 rating, it's also a teen movie suitable for teens of all ages - a little table dancing is about as racy as this one gets.",5,I don't hate anything about this movie,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,3022,"['matter', 'how', 'old', 'get', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'too', 'old', 'enjoy', 'good', 'teen', 'movie', 'Yes', 'rather', 'formulaic', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'smart', 'funny', 'more', 'intelligent', 'average', 'teen', 'comedy', 'also', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'definite', 'plus', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'anything', 'Padua', 'High', 'how', 'many', 'high', 'schools', 'take', 'place', 'huge', 'castle', 'certainly', 'never', 'had', 'English', 'teacher', 'one', 'teaching', 'here', 'high', 'school', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'when', 'cliques', 'romances', 'misunderstandings', 'sibling', 'rivalries', 'like', 'One', 'things', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'according', 'overused', 'formula', 'rich', 'kids', 'vs.', 'poor', 'kids', 'never', 'twain', 'shall', 'meet', ""'re"", 'say', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', '.It', 'true', 'film', 'loosely', 'inspired', 'Shakespeare', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'much', 'How', 'many', 'teens', 'would', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'shrew', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Kat', 'Stratford', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'shrew', 'just', 'bitter', 'disillusioned', 'teen', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'thought', 'doing', 'what', 'expected', 'have', 'reasons', 'taking', 'persona', 'sister', 'Bianca', 'Larisa', 'Oleynik', 'exact', 'opposite', 'vivacious', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'normal', 'teenager', 'problem', 'girls', 'overprotective', 'father', 'who', 'let', 'Bianca', 'date', 'Kat', 'dating', ""n't"", 'look', 'will', 'be', 'happening', 'time', 'soon', 'given', 'Kat', 'nature', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'Cameron', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'smitten', 'Bianca', 'together', 'plan', 'make', 'date-eligible', 'having', 'someone', 'else', 'take', 'out', 'sister', 'ingeniously', 'using', 'school', 'pitifully', 'shallow', 'cool', 'guy', 'Bianca', 'admirer', 'middle', 'man', 'chosen', 'one', 'school', 'mysterious', 'new', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'earn', 'money', 'being', 'paid', 'win', 'reluctant', 'Kat', 'Obviously', 'up', 'falling', 'girl', 'everything', 'place', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'Will', 'Kat', 'designated', 'dater', 'become', 'couple', 'will', 'everything', 'explode', 'guy', 'face', 'Will', 'Bianca', 'ever', 'win', 'right', 'get', 'house', 'spread', 'perkiness', 'who', 'will', 'Bianca', 'choose', 'hot', 'brainless', 'Mr', 'Cool', 'Cameron', 'nice', 'boy', 'who', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'junior', 'high', 'already', 'taller', 'guy', 'will', 'Bianca', 'ever', 'stop', 'putting', 'hair', 'up', 'when', 'out', 'Clich', 'eacute', 'script', 'really', 'rather', 'witty', 'keeping', 'score', 'home', 'film', 'feature', 'one', 'wild', 'dance', 'party', 'required', 'minimum', 'one', 'barfing', 'scene', 'never', 'line', 'completely', 'dumb', 'teen', 'comedy', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'classic', 'John', 'Hughes', 'films', '1980s', 'easily', 'better', 'most', 'teen', 'films', 'produced', 'recent', 'years', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'also', 'teen', 'movie', 'suitable', 'teens', 'ages', 'little', 'table', 'dancing', 'as', 'racy', 'one']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS
468479,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6305537798,Dave. K,"[5, 5]","The 80s were a big time for the teen genre; it seemed like almost every week there was a new teen movie opening, but with the end of the 80s and the end of the John Hughes era seemed to be the end of the teen genre. While there were still some teen movies produced in the 90s they didn't seem to get over as well. But towards the late 90s with the success of the TV series Dawson's Creek and the American Pie franchise suddenly the teen genre was back in a big way. What followed were mostly lackluster movie, but 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the better ones to follow.Clich&eacute;s are a very odd thing; sometimes they can do a movie in due to how predictable it is where as other times they help make the movie enjoyable. 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the movies where the clich&eacute;s actually help and make the movie a lot of fun. We've seen movies like this done back in the 80s and overall done better, but there is just something about this movie that works really well and it comes out very enjoyable.I have no problem with sexuality in movies it's a shame in these PC days everyone seems to complain, but it's kind of nice not having any of that. At first the sexual gags are fun, but then other filmmakers see that and try and up the ante and it's no longer fun. It becomes doing these gags for the sake of it. 10 Things I Hate About You goes back and does things more simple and simply just aims to make you laugh and entertain you and it very much gets the job done.The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith was very well written with excellent and characters with plenty of depth; all the usual type characters are here; the jock, the pretty popular girl, the guy in love with the popular girl, the outcast and the bad boy. With all of that one would think this movie would probably fail, but to the credit of the writers they take the basic teen movie formula and work it well and write a very entertaining movie.Director Gil Junger pretty much delivers the text book teen movie direction and like the writing instead of hurting it really works well despite any clich&eacute;s. When doing a teen flick there are often silly and over the top moments; sometimes they work and sometimes they fell flat. But here the over the top moments are well done and believable.10 Things I Hate About You in my opinion is a much better movie than one might think. The movie has a lot of heart and a great message of just be yourself. This is the type of movie that is a great pick up if you are feeling down. At least for me it works like that and entertains me for 90-minutes and puts a smile on my face and despite any flaws that is all that matters. How the movie ends shouldn't come as much of a shocker to the audience. I think it's safe to know from the very start once the plot kicks in how this will all turn out. But again despite all this 10 Things really works so well and is one of the better teen flicks of the 90s and quite honestly would make my top 10 teen comedies, I really enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would.I'm not gonna jump on the let's all praise Heath Ledger, which due to his tragic death a lot of people are now doing. Heath Ledger was a very talented actor and despite being an Oscar nominated actor didn't fully reach his potential. I think the future was very bright for him and he would have lived up to that potential. But here in 10 Things he was really great. He played the typical teen movie bad boy with another side. And he does it so well and brings so much to the role. His character was one of the leads and honestly it could have been a boring clich&eacute;d character, but Ledger brought so much and almost makes it fresh. Julia Stiles I also really liked; her character was a lot of fun and any scene with her and Heath Ledger worked great.The rest of the cast is excellent as well, but in my opinion Larry Miller as the over-protective father steals the show. I've always liked Larry Miller; he's one of those guys that seems to always pop up. You might not always know his name, but you'll know his face. Even in the smallest of roles he always delivers and in 10 Things I Hate About You he clearly steals the show.Teen driven movies often hire actors in their mid to late 20s and even as old as early 30s. While that isn't old, but for playing a teenager it sure is. So it's really refreshing to see a movie about teenagers and all the actors very close to the ages. Most of the cast in the movie were very close to the ages of their characters at the time of filming.In closing, while 10 Things I Hate About You may not be the most original teen comedy what it lacks in originality it makes up in just pure fun. This movie is a blast from beginning, middle to end. The highlight of the movie is Heath Ledger singing Just too Good to Be True in the bleachers to Julia Stiles.",4,Surprisingly excellent teen comedy,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,4866,"['80s', 'were', 'big', 'time', 'teen', 'genre', 'seemed', 'almost', 'week', 'there', 'was', 'new', 'teen', 'movie', 'opening', 'end', '80s', 'end', 'John', 'Hughes', 'era', 'seemed', 'be', 'end', 'teen', 'genre', 'were', 'still', 'teen', 'movies', 'produced', '90s', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'over', 'as', 'well', 'late', '90s', 'success', 'TV', 'series', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'American', 'Pie', 'franchise', 'suddenly', 'teen', 'genre', 'was', 'back', 'big', 'way', 'What', 'followed', 'were', 'mostly', 'lackluster', 'movie', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'follow.Clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'very', 'odd', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'can', 'do', 'movie', 'due', 'how', 'predictable', 'where', 'other', 'times', 'help', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'clich', 'eacute', 'actually', 'help', 'make', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'done', 'back', '80s', 'overall', 'done', 'better', 'just', 'something', 'movie', 'really', 'well', 'out', 'very', 'enjoyable.I', 'have', 'problem', 'sexuality', 'movies', 'shame', 'PC', 'days', 'everyone', 'complain', 'kind', 'nice', 'not', 'having', 'first', 'sexual', 'gags', 'are', 'fun', 'then', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'see', 'try', 'ante', 'no', 'longer', 'fun', 'doing', 'gags', 'sake', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'back', 'things', 'more', 'simple', 'simply', 'just', 'make', 'laugh', 'entertain', 'very', 'much', 'job', 'done.The', 'screenplay', 'Karen', 'McCullah', 'Lutz', 'Kirsten', 'Smith', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'excellent', 'characters', 'plenty', 'depth', 'usual', 'type', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'jock', 'pretty', 'popular', 'girl', 'guy', 'love', 'popular', 'girl', 'outcast', 'bad', 'boy', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'fail', 'credit', 'writers', 'take', 'basic', 'teen', 'movie', 'formula', 'work', 'well', 'write', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie.Director', 'Gil', 'Junger', 'pretty', 'much', 'delivers', 'text', 'book', 'teen', 'movie', 'direction', 'writing', 'instead', 'hurting', 'really', 'well', 'clich', 'eacute', 'When', 'doing', 'teen', 'flick', 'are', 'often', 'silly', 'top', 'moments', 'sometimes', 'work', 'sometimes', 'fell', 'flat', 'here', 'top', 'moments', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'believable.10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'opinion', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'great', 'message', 'just', 'be', 'type', 'movie', 'great', 'pick', 'up', 'are', 'feeling', 'down', 'least', '90-minutes', 'smile', 'face', 'flaws', 'matters', 'How', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'as', 'much', 'shocker', 'audience', 'think', 'safe', 'know', 'very', 'start', 'plot', 'kicks', 'how', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'again', '10', 'Things', 'really', 'so', 'well', 'one', 'better', 'teen', 'flicks', '90s', 'quite', 'honestly', 'would', 'make', 'top', '10', 'teen', 'comedies', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'would.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'jump', 'let', 'praise', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'due', 'tragic', 'death', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'now', 'doing', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'being', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'reach', 'potential', 'think', 'future', 'was', 'very', 'bright', 'would', 'have', 'lived', 'up', 'potential', 'here', '10', 'Things', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'played', 'typical', 'teen', 'movie', 'bad', 'boy', 'side', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'role', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'leads', 'honestly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'boring', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'character', 'Ledger', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'almost', 'fresh', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'character', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'scene', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'worked', 'great.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'opinion', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'over-protective', 'father', 'show', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'one', 'guys', 'always', 'pop', 'up', 'might', 'not', 'always', 'know', 'name', ""'ll"", 'know', 'face', 'Even', 'smallest', 'roles', 'always', 'delivers', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'clearly', 'show.Teen', 'driven', 'movies', 'often', 'hire', 'actors', 'mid', 'late', '20s', 'even', 'as', 'old', 'early', '30s', ""n't"", 'old', 'playing', 'teenager', 'sure', 'really', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'actors', 'very', 'close', 'ages', 'Most', 'cast', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'close', 'ages', 'characters', 'time', 'filming.In', 'closing', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'original', 'teen', 'comedy', 'what', 'originality', 'up', 'just', 'pure', 'fun', 'movie', 'blast', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'highlight', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'singing', 'Just', 'too', 'Good', 'Be', 'True', 'bleachers', 'Julia', 'Stiles']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS
468480,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6305537798,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[12, 13]","In 1999, the film ""10 Things I Hate About You"" which was is based on William Shakespeare's play ""The Taming of the Shrew"" was adapted to a teen comedy film by screenwriters Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith (both who wrote ""Legally Blonde"", ""The Ugly Truth"", ""The House Bunny"" and ""Ella Enchanted"") and featured first time film director Gil Junger (known for directing TV shows ""Ellen"", ""According to Jim"" and ""Hope and Faith"").The film would be appreciated as a teen romantic comedy and since the film's debut is considered among the top 10 teen romantic comedy films out there and the film is known to be the launching point for the director, the screenwriters and the film that would launch the careers of Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger.The popularity of the film now reaching it's tenth year anniversary has recently generated a television series on ABC Family and now a 10th Anniversary Blu-ray release.VIDEO & AUDIO:""10 Things I Hate About You: 10th Anniversary Edition"" receives its first entry to Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1), the film looks great!  At first, I was a little worried when the stock footage of Seattle was grainy but once you see the film, you can't help but be happy about the detail.  You can see the skin pores of the people, details on the walls and surroundings.  Some scenes are vibrant and colorful, there is a fine layer of grain on the film,  blacks are nice and deep and picture quality that is much better than its DVD counterpart.As for audio quality, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and in French, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is front and center channel driven.  Dialogue and music are clear but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack works for the film.  I was hoping that with the crowd scenes, those sounds would be heard on the surround channels but I really didn't hear too much surround channel usage or even anything from the subwoofer.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""10 Things I Hate About You: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features featured in 1080p or 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French or Spanish subtitles.  Included are:* 10 Things I Love About 10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later - (35:05)  Ten years after the film's initial debut, director Gil Junger, and writers Kirsten Smith and Karen Lutz reflect and hear the story about how this classic teen comedy came to be. Featuring never-before-seen behind the scenes footage, original cast interviews, deleted scenes, original screen test and personal photos from the writers' scrap books.* Audio Commentary with co-writers Karen Lutz and Kirsten Smith, and stars Andrew Keegan, David Krumholtz, Larisa Oleynik and Susan May Pratt - An entertaining commentary with the writers and cast reflecting their past working on the film and working with members of cast and crew.  Also, jokes and hilarious things that happened behind-the-scenes.  Also, everyone talks about their memories of Heath Ledger on the set and auditions.  For fans of the film, listening to this audio commentary makes this release so much worth it!It's important to note that ""deleted scenes"" are mentioned on back of the package are found on the ""10 Things I Love About 10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later"" featurette.JUDGMENT CALL:I can easily remember when the original DVD was released and how badly I wanted it.  ""10 Things I Hate About You"" was in my mind, the best non rated-R teen romantic film.  Although ""American Pie"" was the more popular teen film of that year (the year also featured my other favorite PG-13 teen romance film ""She's All That""), ""10 Things I Hate About You"" was a film I enjoyed because of its sincerity, everyone seemed to click well with each other and the screenplay never had to go the route of being perverted.  Also, that poem by Kat at the end of the film is absolutely classic!But here we are ten years later and ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is a pretty enjoyable film that still holds up today.  But I know the big question for many people is if its worth upgrading from the DVD to the Blu-ray version?  My answer is ""YES!"".  The picture quality is much better than its original DVD counterpart but for those who loved the film, the two special features are just worth watching.The audio commentary is just absolutely hilarious and for the most part, it's like reuniting with old friends again and hearing stories that happened behind-the-scenes of filming to the hotel parties that the cast would have and just the shenanigans that took place and how respectful they were in remember Heath Ledger.  The audio commentary was fantastic!I would have loved more special features to be included but considering that the original DVD had no special features at all, I'm glad that at least we get two special features for this 10th anniversary edition and the two are very entertaining.Overall, ""10 Things I Hate About You: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is a fantastic release for fans of the film.  The DVD may not have a lot of bells and whistles as I would have hoped but for the most part, this Blu-ray release is definitely an improved upgrade over the 1999 DVD and the audio commentary, again...hilarious and all-out-fun.If you are a hardcore fan, a person who enjoyed this film or someone that is curious about this release, ""10 Things I Hate About You: 10th Anniversary Edition""  is definitely recommended!",4,Blu-ray: Those who loved the film will love the reunion of some of the cast for the commentary and special features!,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,5469,"['1999', 'film',

I hate it when comedies change up in the middle and throw you off. That and the parts that are funny, are really funny (like the prom).

He is quickly paired up with the school nerd, Michael (David Krumholtz), who is set to show him around campus. And that, is how Cameron falls in love with Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik). Sure, he's never spoken to her, and he doesn't know much more about her than her name, but he knows that she's the girl of his dreams, and that he'll do anything to get her. Unfortunately, Bianca is not permitted to date until her older sister Katarina ""Kat"" (Julia Stiles), decides to take a plunge into the dating world, which is sure to happen...never! What with Kat's bad reputation, and nasty attitude, no one in their right mind would ever ask her out on a date. But Cameron has an idea. He recruits Patrick ""Pat"" Verona (Heath Ledger), resident bad boy, to take Kat out on a date, and agrees to pay him. After all, if that's what it takes to go out with Bianca, Cameron is willing to do it. It is only when Cameron finds that Mr. Popularity, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), is vying for Bianca's affections as well, that he realizes that he may need more than just charm to win over the beautiful Bianca.I went through a stage for awhile where I had to see every teen movie that was released. Yet, after tons of films, I still found that 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU remained my favorite. And, to this day, it is still one of my favorite films. 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU launched the careers of Julia Stiles (SAVE THE LAST DANCE and O), and Heath Ledger (A KNIGHT'S TALE and THE PATRIOT), which was deserved, as they performed fabulously in this film; what with Stiles' attitude-problem, and Ledger's moodiness. Larisa Oleynik (THE SECRET WORLD OF ALEX MACK and THE BABY-SITTERS CLUB) is wonderful as the whiny, younger sister whose life revolves around boys, clothes, and dating. While Joseph Gordon-Levitt (ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD and MANIC) is fabulous as the charming pursuer, whose many wacky ideas get him into all sorts of mischief. Featuring amazing performances by such seasoned actors as Allison Janney (playing Ms. Perky), and Larry Miller (as Walter Stratford), 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is a movie that is impossible to hate.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",5,How Do I Love Thee?

468508,A1I4WW9TUYEA5Z,6305537798,James R. Williams,"[0, 0]","""10 Things I Hate About You"" was part of an interesting and often-criticized trend in 90's American cinema: Take a popular work of classic literature and place it in a modern teenage world. The high point of the sub-genre was no doubt Amy Heckerling's ultra-hip ""Clueless"", based on Jane Austen's classic novel ""Emma"". That film had a story that was not afraid to break free of its source material and provided audiences with a memorable new heroine and Alicia Silverstone with a sparkling screen debut. By comparison, ""10 Things I Hate About You"" only works some of the time.For all its hip dialogue and contemporary sensibility, it uses plot conventions and cliches so ancient that the very thought of it conjures up images of studio executives passing out scripts made of papyrus scrolls and the story in which it is based, Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"", is used as a springboard for a series of not-so-subtle winks at the camera. The story lacks inspiration in a lot of other key areas as well. It painfully sticks to the traditional boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl formula and for reasons unknown to me, the screenwriters found it necessary to incorporate an assembly line of scenes found in almost ever other run-of-the-mill high school comedy including an obligatory party scene and an emotional climax at the prom.Despite these flaws, the film maintains an air of freshness and undeniable charm thanks to a competent cast and the occasional sprinkling of wit. At Padua High School (wink), Julia Stiles plays Katrina ""Kat"" Stratford, a smart but angst-ridden social outcast. When her more popular and gleefully shallow younger sister, Bianca, wants to date a self-absorbed underwear model, their overbearing father states that Bianca can date, but only if Kat does too. Upon hearing this, Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a shy transfer student who secretly idolizes Bianca, bribes the school bad boy, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), into courting the tempestuous Kat who is won over by Patrick's wily charm in spite of herself.The scene that is most remembered is in fact the one scene of pure joy and originality. In it we see Ledger's character singing and dancing across the bleachers of the school's football stadium whilst professing his love for Kat and for a moment, it is clear that the film indeed has a heartbeat. The chemistry between Stiles and Ledger is the highlight of the film. Their romance is genuine and effective and at times I wished that their characters could have abandoned the script and started fresh with a new plot.Complimenting their performances is a bright and breezy soundtrack and a few praiseworthy supporting players including the always reliable Allison Janney as a horny high school counselor and Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell as a passionate English teacher who raps the words of Shakespeare to glorious effect. Imagine if the writers had taken a cue from the Mitchell character and turned the project into a Shakespeare-inspired rap musical. That would have been interesting!",3,"I burn, I pine, I perish.",1226966400,"11 18, 2008",2008,3043,"['10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'was', 'part', 'interesting', 'often-criticized', 'trend', '90', 'American', 'cinema', 'Take', 'popular', 'work', 'classic', 'literature', 'place', 'modern', 'teenage', 'world', 'high', 'point', 'sub-genre', 'was', 'doubt', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'ultra-hip', 'Clueless', 'based', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'novel', 'Emma', 'film', 'had', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'break', 'free', 'source', 'material', 'provided', 'audiences', 'memorable', 'new', 'heroine', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'sparkling', 'screen', 'debut', 'comparison', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'only', 'time.For', 'hip', 'dialogue', 'contemporary', 'sensibility', 'plot', 'conventions', 'cliches', 'so', 'ancient', 'very', 'thought', 'up', 'images', 'studio', 'executives', 'passing', 'out', 'scripts', 'made', 'papyrus', 'scrolls', 'story', 'based', 'Shakespeare', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'used', 'springboard', 'series', 'not-so-subtle', 'winks', 'camera', 'story', 'inspiration', 'lot', 'other', 'key', 'areas', 'well', 'painfully', 'traditional', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'formula', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'screenwriters', 'found', 'necessary', 'incorporate', 'assembly', 'line', 'scenes', 'found', 'almost', 'ever', 'other', 'run-of-the-mill', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'including', 'obligatory', 'party', 'scene', 'emotional', 'climax', 'prom.Despite', 'flaws', 'film', 'air', 'freshness', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'thanks', 'competent', 'cast', 'occasional', 'sprinkling', 'wit', 'Padua', 'High', 'School', 'wink', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Katrina', 'Kat', 'Stratford', 'smart', 'angst-ridden', 'social', 'outcast', 'When', 'more', 'popular', 'gleefully', 'shallow', 'younger', 'sister', 'Bianca', 'date', 'self-absorbed', 'underwear', 'model', 'overbearing', 'father', 'states', 'Bianca', 'can', 'date', 'only', 'Kat', 'too', 'hearing', 'Cameron', 'James', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'shy', 'transfer', 'student', 'who', 'secretly', 'Bianca', 'school', 'bad', 'boy', 'Patrick', 'Verona', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'courting', 'tempestuous', 'Kat', 'who', 'won', 'Patrick', 'wily', 'charm', 'spite', 'herself.The', 'scene', 'most', 'remembered', 'fact', 'one', 'scene', 'pure', 'joy', 'originality', 'see', 'Ledger', 'character', 'singing', 'dancing', 'bleachers', 'school', 'football', 'stadium', 'whilst', 'professing', 'love', 'Kat', 'moment', 'clear', 'film', 'indeed', 'heartbeat', 'chemistry', 'Stiles', 'Ledger', 'highlight', 'film', 'romance', 'genuine', 'effective', 'times', 'wished', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'abandoned', 'script', 'started', 'fresh', 'new', 'plot.Complimenting', 'performances', 'bright', 'breezy', 'soundtrack', 'few', 'praiseworthy', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'always', 'reliable', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'horny', 'high', 'school', 'counselor', 'Daryl', 'Chill', 'Mitchell', 'passionate', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'words', 'Shakespeare', 'glorious', 'effect', 'Imagine', 'writers', 'had', 'taken', 'cue', 'Mitchell', 'character', 'turned', 'project', 'Shakespeare-inspired', 'rap', 'musical', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

I saw it and read some of the reviews and saw that it was supposed to be a takeoff of my favorite play of all time, TAMING OF THE SHREW, by William Shakespeare. That was enough for me to buy it.It must be admitted that the movie is very loosely based on TAMING OF THE SHREW but the operative words are VERY LOOSELY. Some of the names are right and the rough outline of the idea are there as is the shrewish nature of the elder daghter. After that, the divergance goes pretty wide. That didn't stop it from being a good show.The premise of the story is that there are two daughters with a controlling father. Everyone wants to date the youngest daughter but there is a catch. The younger cannot date until the elder does. Since the eldest is so hard to get along with, Pop thinks that the girls will be safe well into their 40's. That doesn't stop the scheming. A boy is paid to get the elder to go out with him, opening the way for the younger. No one couted on them falling for each other.Some of the elements of Shakespeare's play are not present. This is almost mandatory since the original is anything but politically correct. Kate, the eldest, is played as a shrew but she never becomes tamed. Her famous speech from act 5, or an analog, is not present. Neither are the identities of Bianca's suitors switched to fool the dad. As I said, it was loosely based.I never heard of either of the girls playing the leads but they do a good job. The father seemed familiar, though I don't know his name, and did a great job in his role racking up the laughs. Other minor parts also added magnificently to the whole.This is a great movie and lots of fun. Sit back and enjoy it. Aftwwards, check out Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's TAMING OF THE SHREW.

So he hatches a plan to get Kat hooked with someone so that he can date Bianca.I think the story is cute, and I completely fell for Heath Ledger's character, Patrick (the guy who gets paid to date Kat).

When this movie came out, she and Kirsten Dunst were neck and neck for IT GIRL of Hollywood, and for awhile one would rise up and the other fall, but they had pretty much an even spread.  But now, when I watch TEN THINGS her greatest moment in films, she looks dowdy and the outfits they put her in look horrid.  Meanwhile Dunst goes from good to better roles.  Someone should tell Julia Stiles that with a big face like hers, bangs are better.  And whatever happened to Heath Ledger?  At the time this movie was released, he looked like the next big thing, with a big part in THE PATRIOT, etc, and a bright future.  Now it's like, Heath who?  And starring in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is really going to help his career.Well, all in all, now that THE O C is on TV, why even watch TEN THINGS again?  It's almost the same show, and the girl who plays Bianca here might as well be rehearsing for the part of Summer, and her boyfriend Joey uses the same coy quips as Seth Cohen.  The OC's leads are more attractive than STILES and LEDGER and all in all, it's a more satisfying experience all the way around and at least SUMMER never wore a prom dress as hideous as the one poor BIANCA has to appear in.Years later as I re-read some of my old reviews, I'm mortified by the things I wrote about this film!  Kirsten Dunst doesn't seem like the IT Girl any more than poor Julia Stiles.  Time passes so quickly when you're young and incandescent and the camera's trained its eye on you.

Bianca is the babe of Padua High, the heart's desire of all hormonally-charged young guys there. Elder sister Kat, is not. Now it just so happens that the rules of the Stratford household are that Bianca can get to date when Kat goes on a date. Since Kat is, by choice, date-challenged, Bianca is frustrated, as are her new French tutor Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and model/hunk Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), both desirous of the attentions of Bianca. So Cameron and new Padua High nerdy mate Michael Eckman (David Krumholtz) hatch a little plan to get Kat a date with anyone and score a date with Bianca for Cameron. The plan involves the money-enhanced Joey Donner (who naturally thinks he is to be the recipient of the date with Bianca) paying one Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date Kat. As you can imagine, a tangled web is created, especially when Patrick actually falls for Kat, Cameron realizes that Bianca wants Joey, and Bianca realizes that she cannot stand Joey and wants Cameron.This is the sort of tangled web of a story that only a hack like Shakespeare can actually carry off with ease, and this version of the tale has certainly been updated well. The story has been well brought to life by a cast of essentially up-and-comers, with some nice enough performances on offer. I would like to say that Heath Ledger was one of the notable performances, but here he is somewhat overshadowed by Julia Stiles in my view. In general, the consistency of the cast is the main asset here rather than any being especially stellar. The direction is not much more than a typical by-the-numbers effort by a rent-a-director type that seems to be the norm for the Disney conglomerate.10 Things I Hate About You is a better-than-expected film that I actually quite enjoy.

Although it is loosely based off of the Shakespeare play Taming of the Shrew, One could not tell this unless he/she were to see the play close to when the movie came out. The screenwriters did an excellent job covering up the fact that the plot is centuries old. This modern day version is set in a high school, a very strange place for a Shakespeare play. Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik), a sophomore, is the lovely daughter of a gynecologist who delivers babies for a living. Her father makes a rule that she cannot date until her sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does, a heartless senior who could not care less about men. This has never been a problem before but now there is a new boy, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) who moved to town and they both have an eye for each other. In a desperate attempt to be able to date the lovely Bianca, Joey interviews some tough guys from school. None of them are willing to try to date Kat. Finally, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), a senior who just moved into the area, is willing to do the dirty job, but for some cash. This means that Bianca and her prince can engage in several dates. The dad, meanwhile, is going ballistic, his plan to keep Bianca from dating, forever, is going south. The next thing that he knows Kat wants to go to the Prom with Patrick, which da! da! da! means that Bianca can go too. The movie was an overall success. The plot was interesting, thanks to Shakespeare, but with a new twist that renews the old love story into one that can be enjoyed by our generation.

As Heath Ledger's first major film in the US, it has become the starting point for one of Hollywood's most memorable careers.  Ledger of course was nominated for an Oscar forBrokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)and seems likely for another nomination for his work in ""The Dark Knight.""  As Patrick Verona, he's the hard-edged kid who falls for the girl least likely to be romanced.As Kat Stratford, Julia Stiles won an award from the Chicago Film Critics Association as ""Most Promising Actress.""  With her work in the Bourne series and her new film ""The Bell Jar,"" she's continued to be visible.  She does a great job of walking that fine line between the shrew who disdains pretense and a girl to whom we can still lose our hearts.  Her dance scene is hysterical.Joseph Gordon-Levitt who was a regular on TV's ""Third Rock from the Sun"" and who I have watched recently inStop-Loss,Brick&Mysterious Skin (Deluxe Unrated Director's Edition)plays Cameron James, the love-struck teen who must get a guy to date Kat before he can go out with her sister.Larisa Oleynik who appeared several times on ""Third Rock"" plays Bianca as a superficial party girl.  Their dad is played by Larry Miller who was on the ""Joe Day Afternoon"" episode of one of my favorite TV shows, ""Medium.""  Andrew Keegan who was on TV's ""Party of Five"" plays the narcissistic Joey Donner who pays Patrick to date Kat.  Allison Janey from TV's ""West Wing"" has a delightful cameo as the assistant principal Ms. Perky who moonlights by writing romance novels.  Daryl Mitchell has a very funny role as the teacher Mr. Morgan who seems to dislike his students whenever possible.  David Krumholtz who is the mathematician on TV's ""Numbers"" and who was inSuperbad (Unrated Widescreen Edition)looks youthful as the brainy Michael who suggests to Cameron how to get a date with Bianca.Gil Junger directed the film.  He has done extensive directing on television for series like ""Dharma & Greg"" & ""Ellen"" & is currently directing a TV update of this same film.

It was creative in that spin, yet it was to slapstick to take on a deeper intent. I enjoyed that Heath Ledger really showed a comic and fun character to us. I haven't seen him like that in his more recent movies. Julia Stiles is good as a bitchy teen, taking on the shrew role quite well. I also really liked the counselor, Ms. Perky. She just did was really funny acting like the romantic writer slash autoritarian. It was a pretty much a basic formula for teen films, excepting the 2 leads. One of the actors I have seen before in a movie, he played the other guy dating Stiles popular sister. The movie was pretty much boy meets girl, falls for girl, girl takes a while being a shrew than falls for boy. The other side story is the sister who is completely opposite, bordering on shallow while her sister is deep. She also has the similiar thing going, boy meets girl, girl takes a while to warm up, than girl falls for boy.

Taylor,"[5, 6]","This movie is without a doubt one of those movies that seems to ""stake it's claim"" sort of to speak within many peoples minds, including mine.I'm 23 years of age as I type this. I will be 24 years old in the next few weeks, and I finally seen this movie for the first time this past week, and I have to tell you, I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner. Especially when the movie was first released in 1999, when I would have been 17, and could have related all the more to the people in this movie.This movie, an adaptation of ""taming the shrew"", and is set in modern day times at a school in Washington state if I'm not mistaken. The cast really brings the characters of this movie to life, and the situations the characters find themselves in are very typical of those the teen-ager in high school finds themselves in.This movie has the teen romance story, which is typical of most movies, but involves a few more twists than the average plot. The plot also involves difference characters with different views and standpoints on life in High school, but they all come together to make the plot of the movie work in a fashion that is very likeable, I would imagine for anyone of any age. It really brings to life the teen-ager I think exists within us all.This is one of those movies you will enjoy watching over and over again, especially for certain scense, such as when Patrick (Heath Ledger) performs his musical to gain favor in the sight of Kat (Julia Stiles). Or the part of the movie where Kat, enraged at Joey(another guy in the movie) for pulling in behind her, and blocking her way, backs her car purposely into his Z28 Camaro.....OUCH! There is also some odd humor in this movie, such as when Patrick and Cameron are talking, and when Patrick, after being informed by Cameron that Bianca kissed him asks where Bianca kissed Cameron, Cameron responds by saying ""In the car"".....lol.I don't want to say anymore, as I don't want to give all the scenes away.

468553,A1XX37HBK45UG8,6305537798,L. Wallach,"[68, 72]","10 Things I Hate About You is a fairly basic teen love story, but with the added twist of Shakespeare and some good comedic acting.The story is based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. It is about two sisters, one very popular, Bianca Stratford (played by Larisa Oleynik) and the other, Katrina, or ""Kat"" (played by Julia Stiles) hated because of her gruff character. Their overbearing father (played by the hilarious Larry Miller), devises a scheme whereby Bianca cannot date until rebellious Katrina does, which seems an impossibility. Thereby is set up a scheme to pair Katrina off with the roguish Patrick Verona. One of the masterminds of this plot is Cameron James (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a newcomer to Padua high, where the movie takes place. The other is his assistant of sorts, Michael Eckman (played by David Khumoltz).Though somewhat predictable, especially if you have read Taming of the Shrew, it is an interesting light diversion. The dialogue is quite well done, intertwining a word or phrase from Shakespeare with modern teen slang. Other odes to Shakespeare are seen in Kat's friend who idolizes him as if he is a teen heartthrob, plus reading of his works in one Kat's classes. The timing in the dialogue is also very Shakespearean (for a comedy). It's Very rapid fire. I think both David Khumoltz and Larry Miller are amazingly funny!Overall, this is not your typical shallow teen romance movie, but can appeal to anyone who enjoys witty dialogue, and many literary references.The DVD is unremarkable. It has a good DD 5.1 soundtrack driven by a nice selection of alternative rock - Letters from Clio had several cameos, but I believe they mainly played cover tunes, not their own stuff.

The genre of teen movies is considered by many as an easy target for criticism, which of course is not completely unjustified. Nevertheless, films belonging to that genre are not necessarily full of flaws. ""10 things I hate about you"" is such an example.I have not read Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"" so I cannot say if the script of ""10 things I hate about you"" is close to the Bard's original work, from which it was inspired. What I can say though, is that ""10 things I hate about you"" is a fresh, witty movie with sharp dialogs and a rather interesting set of characters.The plot: What can you do when your high school love interest is not allowed to go on a date with you, unless her older sister first goes on a date herself? What about becoming an ally with your main rival in order to find a guy capable of dating the older sister?Larisa Oleynik plays Bianca, the pretty, always in fashion but rather shallow, younger sister. Kat (Julia Stiles) is the older sister. She is the one that has to go on a date first, if her younger sister can go out too. The problem is that Kat is unpopular and ""incapable of human interaction"".Bianca immediately catches the attention of Cameron (Joseph-Gordon Levitt), the likable, smart (how else would he be able to learn French so quickly??), and shy, new boy on the block. Cameron with his friend (David Krumholtz, in a role that provides some good moments of laugh) will have to try and persuade the wild and scary Patrick (Heath Ledger), who may not be that wild and scary after all, to go out with Kat. Of course, there is the ""bad"" guy, played by Andrew Keegan, who will try to mess things up, just when everything seems to lead to a happy ending.I especially liked the Kat-Patrick couple. Stiles and Ledger definitely have the required chemistry and are able to make us believe how their relationship gradually develops into genuine love.Apart from the main characters, a big asset of the film is the supporting characters, like the English teacher (who makes a habit of throwing Kat out of his class, without any apparent reason) or the sex-obsessed counselor (who tries hard to find fitting words for her new novel...)Overall, ""10 things I hate about you"" offers quite a number of moments of genuine laughter, without ever resorting to cheap or crude humor. It is a movie that you will enjoy, if you know what to expect.One thing though, I have to note as a negative: there were no real extras in the DVD version to completely justify such a purchase.",4,A Fresh View of Taming the Bard's Shrew,1027555200,"07 25, 2002",2002,2656,"['Being', 'advocate', 'claim', 'can', 'find', 'good', 'movies', 'film', 'genre', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'support', 'point', 'genre', 'teen', 'movies', 'considered', 'many', 'easy', 'target', 'criticism', 'course', 'not', 'completely', 'unjustified', 'Nevertheless', 'films', 'belonging', 'genre', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'full', 'flaws', '10', 'things', 'hate', 'example.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Shakespeare', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'script', '10', 'things', 'hate', 'close', 'Bard', 'original', 'work', 'was', 'inspired', 'What', 'can', 'say', '10', 'things', 'hate', 'fresh', 'witty', 'movie', 'sharp', 'dialogs', 'rather', 'interesting', 'set', 'characters.The', 'plot', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'high', 'school', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'allowed', 'go', 'date', 'older', 'sister', 'first', 'date', 'What', 'becoming', 'ally', 'main', 'rival', 'order', 'find', 'guy', 'capable', 'dating', 'older', 'sister', 'Larisa', 'Oleynik', 'Bianca', 'pretty', 'always', 'fashion', 'rather', 'shallow', 'younger', 'sister', 'Kat', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'older', 'sister', 'one', 'go', 'date', 'first', 'younger', 'sister', 'can', 'go', 'out', 'too', 'problem', 'Kat', 'unpopular', 'incapable', 'human', 'interaction', '.Bianca', 'immediately', 'attention', 'Cameron', 'Joseph-Gordon', 'Levitt', 'likable', 'smart', 'how', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'French', 'quickly', 'shy', 'new', 'boy', 'block', 'Cameron', 'friend', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'role', 'good', 'moments', 'laugh', 'will', 'have', 'try', 'persuade', 'wild', 'scary', 'Patrick', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'wild', 'scary', 'go', 'out', 'Kat', 'course', 'bad', 'guy', 'played', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', 'who', 'will', 'try', 'mess', 'things', 'up', 'just', 'when', 'everything', 'lead', 'happy', 'ending.I', 'especially', 'liked', 'Kat-Patrick', 'couple', 'Stiles', 'Ledger', 'definitely', 'have', 'required', 'chemistry', 'are', 'able', 'make', 'believe', 'how', 'relationship', 'gradually', 'genuine', 'love.Apart', 'main', 'characters', 'big', 'asset', 'film', 'supporting', 'characters', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'habit', 'throwing', 'Kat', 'class', 'apparent', 'reason', 'sex-obsessed', 'counselor', 'who', 'hard', 'find', 'fitting', 'words', 'new', 'novel', 'Overall', '10', 'things', 'hate', 'quite', 'number', 'moments', 'genuine', 'laughter', 'ever', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'crude', 'humor', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'know', 'what', 'expect.One', 'thing', 'have', 'note', 'negative', 'were', 'real', 'extras', 'DVD', 'version', 'completely', 'justify', 'such', 'purchase']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

So here's the problem: Their father came up with this rule: &quot;Bianca doesn't date... until Kat does&quot; The shy new guy Cameron falls for Bianca the day he arrives.

There's real chemistry there.

It's about the characters and their relations so I guess it is best that it is kept very simple. There are some pretty cute songs in the movie which want to make you to buy the soundtrack. There's almost no score but the source music is pretty amazing...THE DVD: Shame on Touchstone! The DVD comes with less than none Special features and sound and picture quality are mediocre..

468562,AN7JDZOXH1WC4,6305537798,"Matthew Easterbrook ""silverscreenjunkie""","[29, 36]","10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is a modern update on William Shakespeare's classic comedy THE TAMING OF THE SHREW.  Meaning it's not Kenneth Branagh.  Meaning you don't need an English-Elizabethan dictionary to understand half  the words.  Meaning no fops parading around in tight tights.  Meaning no  royal kerfuffles.  Meaning no ghosts, witches, fairies, or one-legged  Turkish disco dancers.  Meaning no obscure references that only English  teachers get.  Meaning no actors walking around talking to themselves like  they just got released from Shady Acres Happy Home.  Meaning, finally, a  movie geared towards a young audience.  And unlike some modern-day  adaptations of classic plays or movies, this one will actually hold your  attention for more than seventeen seconds.What makes 10 THINGS I HATE  ABOUT YOU really work is two things.  First of all, it doesn't pander down  to its audience, instead treating it as an equal.  Second, and most  importantly, writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kristen Smith flesh out the  characters and make them seem real.  This couldn't be accomplished without  good actors, and 10 THINGS has plenty of those.  Instead of going with the  huge teen stars of the moment (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar,  Freddie Prinze Jr, or any other heartthrob with three or more names), the  casting directors chose lesser-known actors who could get by on talent, and  not necessarily name value alone.  They chose wisely.Stiles makes Kat  into a multifaceted, complex heroine who is both charming and viciously  fierce.  Ledger brings a new dimension to the oft-used &quot;rebel who's  really a misunderstood poetic soul&quot; cliche.  The chemistry between  these two is probably the most compelling part of the movie.  When Patrick  serenades Kat with the song &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You&quot;  accompanied by the school marching band, it's such a joyous and spontaneous  moment that I guarantee your heart will melt and you'll break into a huge  smile in spite of yourself.  10 cheers for 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU!",4,10 Things I Love About This Movie!,952560000,"03 9, 2000",2000,2065,"['10', 'THINGS', 'HATE', 'YOU', 'modern', 'update', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'classic', 'comedy', 'THE', 'TAMING', 'THE', 'SHREW', 'Meaning', 'not', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Meaning', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'English-Elizabethan', 'dictionary', 'understand', 'words', 'Meaning', 'fops', 'parading', 'around', 'tight', 'tights', 'Meaning', 'royal', 'kerfuffles', 'Meaning', 'ghosts', 'witches', 'fairies', 'one-legged', 'Turkish', 'disco', 'dancers', 'Meaning', 'obscure', 'references', 'only', 'English', 'teachers', 'get', 'Meaning', 'actors', 'walking', 'around', 'talking', 'just', 'got', 'released', 'Shady', 'Acres', 'Happy', 'Home', 'Meaning', 'finally', 'movie', 'geared', 'young', 'audience', 'modern-day', 'adaptations', 'classic', 'plays', 'movies', 'one', 'will', 'actually', 'hold', 'attention', 'more', 'seventeen', 'seconds.What', '10', 'THINGS', 'HATE', 'YOU', 'really', 'work', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'all', ""n't"", 'pander', 'down', 'audience', 'instead', 'treating', 'equal', 'Second', 'most', 'importantly', 'writers', 'Karen', 'McCullah', 'Lutz', 'Kristen', 'Smith', 'out', 'characters', 'make', 'seem', 'real', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'accomplished', 'good', 'actors', '10', 'THINGS', 'plenty', 'Instead', 'going', 'huge', 'teen', 'stars', 'moment', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr', 'other', 'heartthrob', 'three', 'more', 'names', 'casting', 'directors', 'chose', 'lesser-known', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'talent', 'not', 'necessarily', 'name', 'value', 'alone', 'chose', 'wisely.Stiles', 'Kat', 'multifaceted', 'complex', 'heroine', 'who', 'charming', 'viciously', 'fierce', 'Ledger', 'new', 'dimension', 'oft-used', 'quot', 'rebel', 'who', 'really', 'misunderstood', 'poetic', 'soul', 'quot', 'cliche', 'chemistry', 'two', 'probably', 'most', 'compelling', 'part', 'movie', 'When', 'Patrick', 'Kat', 'song', 'quot', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'My', 'Eyes', 'Off', 'quot', 'accompanied', 'school', 'marching', 'band', 'such', 'joyous', 'spontaneous', 'moment', 'guarantee', 'heart', 'will', 'melt', ""'ll"", 'break', 'huge', 'smile', 'spite', '10', 'cheers', '10', 'THINGS', 'HATE', 'YOU']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS
468563,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305537798,Matthew Horner,"[1, 4]","10 Things I Hate About You claims to be based on Shakespeare's bawdy, politically incorrect play, The Taming of the Shrew. In truth, the movie uses only fragments of the Bard's tale about a man-hating young woman who is ""tamed"" by a man who is at least is mad as she is. It is a difficult work for modern audiences, because 400 years has seen drastic changes in the battle of the sexes. The film's creators failed to revise the material satisfactorily. There are elements of it which make it watchable, but it turns out to be a fairly typical romantic comedy aimed at teens.Bianca Stratford [Larisa Oleynik] has never had a date. She's pretty and smart in a kind of valley girl way, but her Dad refuses to let her go out with a boy unless her older sister, Katrina [Julia Styles], starts dating. Katrina hates boys, and Bianca's social future looks dim. [This plot device is an example of the weakness of the story's update. In the Shakespeare version, the younger sister could not marry until her shrewish sister did. This was a custom of the time. Bianca's father comes off as a fruitcake.] Enter Cameron [Joseph Gordon-Levitt], the new boy at Padua High in Seattle. It's love at first sight when he meets Bianca. One of his friends convinces the campus hunk, who also has the hots for Bianca, to pay the school rebel, Patrick [Heath Ledger] to con Katrina into going out with him. This will free Bianca. Naturally, the idea falls apart, and the characters encounter a series of comic mishaps.There are some bright spots. The story lights up when Julia Styles and Heath Ledger are onscreen. Unlike the other performers, most of whom came from television, these two have worked in live theater since they were kids. He was trained in Australia, she in New York. They are obviously familiar with the original play. In addition, they have an obvious chemistry.The school's guidance counselor, who spends most of her time writing a bad erotic novel, is hilarious. A black English teacher with attitude reads Shakespeare's sonnets with a rap rhythm. They actual sound pretty good. His bad attitude may be caused by the school's being about 98% white.Seattle and Tacoma, the two cities the movie was shot in, provide lush backdrops. The songs chosen for the movie are weak for the most part. It is hard to imagine this hip high school crowd being eager to jump and dance to these tunes. Out takes are shown during the end credits. These are interesting because they imply that 10 Things I Hate About You should have been far more energetic and offbeat.",2,"A minority opinion, it would seem! :-)",1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,2548,"['10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'claims', 'be', 'based', 'Shakespeare', 'bawdy', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'play', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'truth', 'movie', 'only', 'fragments', 'Bard', 'tale', 'man-hating', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'tamed', 'man', 'who', 'least', 'mad', 'difficult', 'work', 'modern', 'audiences', '400', 'years', 'seen', 'drastic', 'changes', 'battle', 'sexes', 'film', 'creators', 'failed', 'revise', 'material', 'satisfactorily', 'are', 'elements', 'make', 'watchable', 'out', 'be', 'fairly', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'aimed', 'teens.Bianca', 'Stratford', '[', 'Larisa', 'Oleynik', ']', 'never', 'had', 'date', 'pretty', 'smart', 'kind', 'valley', 'girl', 'way', 'Dad', 'let', 'go', 'out', 'boy', 'older', 'sister', 'Katrina', '[', 'Julia', 'Styles', ']', 'dating', 'Katrina', 'boys', 'Bianca', 'social', 'future', 'dim', '[', 'plot', 'device', 'example', 'weakness', 'story', 'update', 'Shakespeare', 'version', 'younger', 'sister', 'could', 'not', 'marry', 'shrewish', 'sister', 'did', 'was', 'custom', 'time', 'Bianca', 'father', 'off', 'fruitcake', ']', 'Enter', 'Cameron', '[', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', ']', 'new', 'boy', 'Padua', 'High', 'Seattle', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'when', 'Bianca', 'One', 'friends', 'campus', 'hunk', 'who', 'also', 'hots', 'Bianca', 'pay', 'school', 'rebel', 'Patrick', '[', 'Heath', 'Ledger', ']', 'con', 'Katrina', 'going', 'out', 'will', 'free', 'Bianca', 'Naturally', 'idea', 'apart', 'characters', 'encounter', 'series', 'comic', 'are', 'bright', 'spots', 'story', 'up', 'when', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'are', 'onscreen', 'other', 'performers', 'most', 'whom', 'came', 'television', 'two', 'have', 'worked', 'live', 'theater', 'were', 'kids', 'was', 'trained', 'Australia', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'obviously', 'familiar', 'original', 'play', 'addition', 'have', 'obvious', 'chemistry.The', 'school', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'writing', 'bad', 'erotic', 'novel', 'hilarious', 'black', 'English', 'teacher', 'attitude', 'reads', 'Shakespeare', 'sonnets', 'rap', 'rhythm', 'actual', 'sound', 'pretty', 'good', 'bad', 'attitude', 'may', 'be', 'caused', 'school', 'being', '98', '%', 'white.Seattle', 'Tacoma', 'two', 'cities', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'provide', 'lush', 'backdrops', 'songs', 'chosen', 'movie', 'are', 'weak', 'most', 'part', 'hard', 'imagine', 'hip', 'high', 'school', 'crowd', 'being', 'eager', 'jump', 'dance', 'tunes', 'are', 'shown', 'end', 'credits', 'are', 'interesting', 'imply', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'energetic', 'offbeat']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

""Ten Things I Hate About You"" is VERY LOOSELY based on William Shakespeare's comedic masterpiece, ""The Taming of the Shrew."" The film is set in a modern day high school. Kat (Julia Stiles) is an angry teenage girl who seems to loathe all men. Her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is a popular girl who can't wait to immerse herself in the dating scene. Unfortunately for Bianca, her overprotective father (Larry Miller) is incredibly paranoid and doesn't want to see either of his daughters come within 50 feet of a member of the opposite sex. In order to pacify Bianca's constant complaints, her father finally concedes that he'll lift the dating ban as soon as man-hater Kat shoes an interest in boys, which is unlikely to happen in the near future. Once Bianca's potential beau (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds out about this, he hires a mysterious classmate, Patrick (Heath Ledger), to feign an interest in Kat and loosen her up, thereby freeing up Bianca to date. At first Patrick is happy to oblige, but he is stunned when he begins to develop feelings for Kat, who isn't always as cold and collected as she appears to be.This movie is very entertaining. As a big ""Taming of the Shrew"" fan, I really enjoyed the occasional snippets of Shakespearean dialogue. This film does an excellent job of reinventing Shakespeare in a very modern way.

One of the results of sparky, entertaining films such as this reminder that Shakespeare is a writer for all ages, not just some literary legend who speaks only to the time in which he lived and is therefore fit for a privileged few, as well s the odd GCSE taker.Far from it, 10 Things I Hate About You - based on The Taming of the Shrew - has the wide appeal to be a big succes and the quirkiness to prove a cultish hit too. Wisely skirting the less politically correct issues within this mighty clash of the sexes tale, writers Lutz and Smith have made a John Hughes-esque high school romantic comedy that provokes as much thought as it does laughs.Beautiful yet aloof Katarina Stratford (Julia Stiles) is given a wide berth at Padua High School, where she is feared for her feisty manner and biting wit. Her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is much more popular, especially with new boy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is desperate for a date with her. But this is far from easy as their horribly nervous father insists that if they are to date, they must date together, safe in the knowledge that Kat would never find a man who could live with her exacting standards. So Cameron and his new pal Michael (David Krumholtz) set about to finding such a man. The lucky guy they select is the brooding Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) who no-nonsense tough guy image would seem the ideal foil for Kat.And the start of the fun when things don't go quite as well as planned. Laughs come effortlessly out of the characters and their plight, as all play out a drama that has a basis in reality, that is recognisably an adaption of the Schrew, but which is a fun film all on its own. Above all, Stiles and Ledger make a winning couple against a roster of entertaining supporting characters, as the film proves itself stylish, uplifting and thoroughly winning.",4,Kiss me Kat,973296000,"11 4, 2000",2000,1970,"['Shakespeare', 'revival', 'unabated', 'Stratford-based', 'writer', 'be', 'more', 'demand', 'ever', 'One', 'results', 'sparky', 'entertaining', 'films', 'such', 'reminder', 'Shakespeare', 'writer', 'ages', 'not', 'just', 'literary', 'legend', 'who', 'only', 'time', 'lived', 'therefore', 'fit', 'privileged', 'few', 'as', 'well', 'odd', 'GCSE', 'taker.Far', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'based', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'wide', 'appeal', 'be', 'big', 'succes', 'quirkiness', 'prove', 'cultish', 'hit', 'too', 'Wisely', 'skirting', 'less', 'politically', 'correct', 'issues', 'mighty', 'clash', 'sexes', 'tale', 'writers', 'Lutz', 'Smith', 'have', 'made', 'John', 'Hughes-esque', 'high', 'school', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'laughs.Beautiful', 'yet', 'aloof', 'Katarina', 'Stratford', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'given', 'wide', 'berth', 'Padua', 'High', 'School', 'where', 'feared', 'feisty', 'manner', 'biting', 'wit', 'younger', 'sister', 'Bianca', 'Larisa', 'Oleynik', 'much', 'more', 'popular', 'especially', 'new', 'boy', 'Cameron', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'desperate', 'date', 'far', 'easy', 'horribly', 'nervous', 'father', 'are', 'date', 'must', 'date', 'together', 'safe', 'knowledge', 'Kat', 'would', 'never', 'find', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'live', 'exacting', 'standards', 'So', 'Cameron', 'new', 'pal', 'Michael', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'set', 'finding', 'such', 'man', 'lucky', 'guy', 'select', 'brooding', 'Patrick', 'Verona', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'no-nonsense', 'tough', 'guy', 'image', 'would', 'seem', 'ideal', 'foil', 'Kat.And', 'start', 'fun', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'planned', 'Laughs', 'come', 'effortlessly', 'characters', 'plight', 'play', 'out', 'drama', 'basis', 'reality', 'recognisably', 'adaption', 'Schrew', 'fun', 'film', 'own', 'Stiles', 'Ledger', 'make', 'winning', 'couple', 'roster', 'entertaining', 'supporting', 'characters', 'film', 'stylish', 'uplifting', 'thoroughly', 'winning']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

But the fact remains, this movie is just irresistable.  It's one of the few ""teen movies"" that seems to remain totally watchable over and over again.  The performances are all terrific, down to even  the smaller roles (Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell as Mr. Morgan the take-no-prisoners English teacher and Allison Janney as Ms. Perky, the brutally efficient romance-novel-writing guidance counselor).  While there's a certain amount of stereotyping going on amid the ""geeks"" and the ""cool kids"", both types are portrayed with more humor and complexity than usual.  The story's take on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew is, like other reviewers have indicated, a good balance between faithfulness and fun.

468588,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6305537798,Only-A-Child,"[2, 2]","""10 Things I Hate About You"" (1999) is probably the all-time most ambitious of the teen comedies. Updates of classic literature like this have become relatively common; ""Emma"" is adapted as ""Clueless"", ""Othello"" as ""O"", ""Pygmalion"" becomes ''She's All That'', etc. etc. ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" (which has also been adapted as the Broadway musical and film ""Kiss Me Kate"").The strange title is less Shakespeare derived than a play on the Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnet that begins ''How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.'' Even knowing this, the title withholds its relationship to the film content until the climatic scene late in the film when Katerina (Julia Stiles) reads her poem (in iambic pentameter) to the class: ""I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all"". Either the producers can't count of they didn't like the sound of ""13 Things I Hate About You""The film was fairly popular at the time of its release and made a considerable amount of money,  but critical reaction was mixed. Most of the negative reviews came from critics who felt the film was too distanced from the original; specifically that Katerina was not Shakespeare's mega-shrew and that her taming was just too tame. While these observations are correct, in this case toning down the original makes the film work better. A less gritty story allows for more lyrical storytelling and better unity with the great pop soundtrack and the inventive cinematography. And few will miss the original's out-of-control misogyny. The film goes out on fantastic rotational helicopter shot of the group ""Letters from Cleo"" as they perform the closing song on top of spectacular Stadium High School in Tacoma.The story begins with obstetrician Walter Stratford's (Larry Miller) grudging agreement to allow his younger daughter Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) to date if her older sister Katerina (Stiles) starts dating. Walter's occupation has made him super-paranoid about teen pregnancy, but he feel quite safe with this compromise because Katerina is a brain with little interest in boys and an abrasive enough personality to drive away anyone who might be attracted to her.Miller and Stiles are exceptional in these roles, the best performances of their careers. Oleynik (formally Alex Mack) does not have nearly as much to work with but is solid in her role; if you view the film a second time you can better appreciate the subtle tease she brings to this role. My main criticism is that the film has the same dynamic as ""Some Kind of Wonderful"", with the abrasive tomboy significantly more desirable than the foxy girl every guy is after. Back in her ""Alex Mack"" days Oleynik was the #1 ranked female in a People Magazine survey of the most beautiful person in the world. I don't see it and I'm pretty sure that I have a lot of company.One interesting bit of trivia is that Oleynik went on to attend and graduate from Sarah Lawrence College, the school that Katerina wants to attend in the film.Female viewers will generally be pleased with Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona (afterall the action takes place at Padua High School),  who is hired by two of Bianca's admirers to tame the shrew.  Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) is the obnoxious pretty boy who is cruising for his comeuppance throughout the film; but he is not close to the bad guy standard set by  ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and Pretty in Pink"". Allison Janney is hilarious as a porno-writing guidance counselor.I really liked the tentative feeling between Patrick and Katerina. In one of the most enjoyable scenes he appears in the grandstands while she is at soccer practice and sings ''I Love You Baby'' over the P.A. system, having bribed the school's marching band to accompany him from down on the field.Then again, what do I know?

468595,A1LDIMQISH07WK,6305537798,Rebecca,"[2, 3]","Many people - mainly adults - put down teen flicks these days. Being a teen myself, I can say that it's probably because most adults don't think and act the way we do...which means they have different tastes in everything - including movies! But just because you see a movie and it looks as though it's gonna be labeled as a &quot;teen flick&quot;, doesn't mean that it's actually a bad film; it might actually (believe it or not) be awesome! And that's what 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is. I have to admit though that I do intend to enjoy many of the teen flicks that are out there these days such as SHE'S ALL THAT, DROP DEAD GOREGOUS, BRING IT ON, RUSHMORE, DRIVE ME CRAZY, the SCREAM series, the I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER series, IDLE HANDS, CRUEL INTENTIONS, THE FACULTY, and many others not listed here. But hey, what can you expect from a 17-year-old American girl? (It's not surprising that I love most of the cute guys that are in these movies, too!) But trust me, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is an excellent teen flick with an excellent casting assemble, starring some of today's hottest young &quot;teen flick&quot; actors such as Julia Stiles, Joseph-Gorden Levitt, and Heath Ledger, along with many others. This movie is based on a modernized version of one of William Shakespeare's plays (I forget which one). It takes place at a high school in Seattle, Washington. The movie is about this new kid who comes to the school, Cameron (Joseph-Gorden Levitt), and who tries to win over a girl named Bianca who is of course very beautiful and perfect. The only problem is, is that Bianca's not allowed to date (ordered by her strict father) until her older rebellion sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), does! When Cameron finds this out, he pays a cool, snobish model-jock, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), to find someone who Kat will go out with. If Joey does this for Cameron, then Cameron promised him Joey will get to date Bianca (whom Joey is also in love with). Hearing this, Joey goes off and finally discovers the dark, mysterious Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) who seems to be the perfect match for Kat, since they have so much in common. Joey then pays Patrick to take her on a date, and Patrick and Kat end up falling in love and even go to the prom together. This is great for Cameron because Cameron was able to ask Bianca out and they end up going to Kat and Patrick's Prom. Kat and Patrick also end up going to the Prom and everything seems perfect until Joey (who is furious at Cameron for &quot;stealing his girl&quot;) shouts out during the Prom that he paid Patrick to go out with Kat so he could go out with Bianca! Then Kat gets mad at Patrick for thinking that he lied to her and leaves! (I don't want to spoil the entire movie so I won't say what happens at the end.) And now that Patrick has fallen in love with Kat, he must find a way to win her back.

468603,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305537798,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 3]","&quot;10 Things I Hate About You,&quot; a modern updating of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew,&quot; demonstrates what happens when filmmakers drain The Bard of his poetry and language and cater to modern moviegoing tastes -  they reduce a classic work to yet another in a long line of lamebrained,  dull teenagers-on-the-make tales featuring a contingent of adolescents who  would never be caught dead reading Shakespeare.In this version, set in  contemporary Tacoma, Kate and Bianca have been converted into two  squabbling high school sisters, the former a notorious harridan from whom  all peers flee and the latter a virginal beauty whom all the boys covet but  who is laboring under her father's edict that she not be able to date until  her older sister does.That Shakespeare's plot fails to translate to  modern times goes without saying since the father's obsession lacks the  kind of logic the original author provided. In the original's historical  context, the cultural tradition dictating that the older daughter must  marry before the younger one rings true as a motivation for the story's  narrative underpinnings. Here, since the fathers seems mostly concerned  with the - real or imagined - horrifying consequences of his daughter's  dating, his decision to allow Bianca to date only if Kate does seems  counterintuitive and counterproductive. It seems hardly sensible that his  fears would be allayed by having TWO daughters out on the town with  boyfriends.All this could be forgiven if the filmmakers had provided a  screenplay with even a smidgen of cleverness and humor. In fact, the first  ten minutes hint at a reasonably astute satire of modern high school life,  particularly in the character of a sex-obsessed female counselor who  provides the only moments of amusement in the entire film. Since she us  dropped almost immediately from the action, all we are left with is the  spectacle of a group of shallow teenagers laboriously executing the  mechanics of a once irresistable plot. Kate is nowhere near the terrifying  shrew nor her pursuer the arrogant rogue they need to be to be comically  effective. They come across as only slightly askew, but basically ordinary,  adolescents who lack the charisma to make them even slightly  interesting.&quot;10 Things&quot; proves yet again that Shakespeare  without Shakespeare results only in a bareboned plot devoid of wit and  artistry.",2,Shakespeare adulteration,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,2410,"['quot', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'quot', 'modern', 'updating', 'quot', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'quot', 'what', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'drain', 'Bard', 'poetry', 'language', 'cater', 'modern', 'moviegoing', 'tastes', 'reduce', 'classic', 'work', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'lamebrained', 'dull', 'teenagers-on-the-make', 'tales', 'featuring', 'contingent', 'adolescents', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'reading', 'Shakespeare.In', 'version', 'set', 'contemporary', 'Tacoma', 'Kate', 'Bianca', 'have', 'been', 'converted', 'two', 'squabbling', 'high', 'school', 'sisters', 'former', 'notorious', 'harridan', 'whom', 'peers', 'flee', 'latter', 'virginal', 'beauty', 'whom', 'boys', 'covet', 'who', 'laboring', 'father', 'edict', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'date', 'older', 'sister', 'Shakespeare', 'plot', 'translate', 'modern', 'times', 'saying', 'father', 'obsession', 'kind', 'logic', 'original', 'author', 'provided', 'original', 'historical', 'context', 'cultural', 'tradition', 'dictating', 'older', 'daughter', 'must', 'marry', 'younger', 'one', 'rings', 'true', 'motivation', 'story', 'narrative', 'underpinnings', 'Here', 'fathers', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'real', 'imagined', 'horrifying', 'consequences', 'daughter', 'dating', 'decision', 'allow', 'Bianca', 'date', 'only', 'Kate', 'counterintuitive', 'counterproductive', 'hardly', 'sensible', 'fears', 'would', 'be', 'allayed', 'having', 'TWO', 'daughters', 'out', 'town', 'boyfriends.All', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'provided', 'screenplay', 'even', 'smidgen', 'cleverness', 'humor', 'fact', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'hint', 'reasonably', 'astute', 'satire', 'modern', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'particularly', 'character', 'sex-obsessed', 'female', 'counselor', 'who', 'only', 'moments', 'amusement', 'entire', 'film', 'dropped', 'almost', 'immediately', 'action', 'are', 'left', 'spectacle', 'group', 'shallow', 'teenagers', 'laboriously', 'executing', 'mechanics', 'once', 'irresistable', 'plot', 'Kate', 'nowhere', 'terrifying', 'shrew', 'pursuer', 'arrogant', 'rogue', 'need', 'be', 'be', 'comically', 'effective', 'come', 'only', 'slightly', 'askew', 'basically', 'ordinary', 'adolescents', 'who', 'lack', 'charisma', 'make', 'even', 'slightly', 'interesting.', 'quot', '10', 'Things', 'quot', 'yet', 'again', 'Shakespeare', 'Shakespeare', 'results', 'only', 'bareboned', 'plot', 'devoid', 'wit', 'artistry']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","After seeing Andrew Keegan on a re-run of ""Moesha,"" I started checking up on what else he'd been up to since ""Party of Five"" because I hadn't really seen him in anything outside of that and ""Camp Nowhere."" I'd heard of this movie but never saw it so I checked it out. The beginning of the movie was rough, especially with that horny principal. I was thinking, ""What was Gabrielle Union thinking trying out for this one? This is worse than those cheerleader movies."" But then the characters were so ridiculous, from the teacher cursing everybody out to Keegan's character, Joey, being beyond vain. Julia Stiles is cool, and I liked that she was rebelling against the normal. I figured I had the movie now. May as well give it a shot. And it picked up. Was it ridiculous? Absolutely. When Joey drew a penis on the side of that one guy's face, I knew this movie was going to have plenty of laughs. And it did. But in between the laughing was a story about a girl who had a deeper reason for rebelling, which I'd already guessed as soon as I saw the two interact.The summary is basically that Bianca wants to be a popular teenage girl who dates. Her father won't let her date unless her sister, Kat, dates, too. Since Kat (Stiles' character) seems to be completely repulsed by teenage boys, that'll be a challenge. But when Joey pays Patrick (played by Heath Ledger, whose name I knew but I'd never seen him in any movies outside of playing the Joker) to get Kat to go out with him, the game is on. The only problem is Cameron (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) likes her, too, so he's trying to get in on the deal. A bunch of confusion happens, and the ending is as predictable as you'd expect. I loved watching Stiles and Ledger interact onscreen though.Another thing that amused me about the movie was the crazy choices of music. They went from George Clinton with ""Atomic Dog"" to Salt n' Pepa to Biggie, and then into a bunch of rock songs I didn't know. And Stiles has been watching ""Player's Club"" because she danced a little too convincing. Pure entertainment.

There are  a million good things I can say about this movie. It's one of the best reinterpretations of the classic story I've seen.Ten Things I Hate About You retells Shakespeare's classic story in a suburban high school this time. The shrew this time is a high school feminist. A young player wants to date her sister a bubbly princess, but the overprotective father won't let the daughters date. His rule is unless the older feminist sister dates, she can't. So the young man recruits the help of a bad boy to help him get his girl. What could have been a predictable story turns magical over the next hour. Romance, laughs, drama this movie has it all and then some.Ten Things I Hate About You works because of the strong writing, solid direction and great performances from the cast. This modernized version captures the heart and soul of Shakespeare's material and makes it relatable to today. The characters in this script are so well developed and the actors make them into three-dimensional people you want to root for.Julia Stiles gives the best performance of her career here. She carries the movie from opening act to final scene. The late Heath Ledger is equally strong here; he has great chemistry with Stiles and shows great acting range even in this early role. I loved the scenes on the football field! Gabrielle Union is solid in a supporting role. I wish she had this kind of writing and direction in Deliver Us From Eva. Deliver Us From Eva retells the exact same story but she's ten times better in this movie than in that one. The rest of the cast is just as great. Everyone should give themselves a round of applause.

I didn't like Boyz much, but this was briliant! I knew already that it was based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of The Shrew"". I loved Kat's witty dialogue and personality. From the moment I heard ""Bad Reputation"" playing, I knew Kat was going to be as much of a shrew as Shakespeare's original Kate was.Bianca was also a character I loved in some ways. I couldn't help enjoying her shallow conversation with her friend Chastity at the beginning ""Yeah, but see, there's a difference between like and love, cause I like my Sketchers, but I love my Prada backpack.""""But I love my Sketchers.""""That's because you don't have a Prada backpack.""Now, the story. Kat (Julia Stiles) and Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) Stratford have a dating rule. Bianca can date when Kat does. However, Kat doesn't want to date, which poses a problem for her younger sister, who wants to date. She even has two choices. There's new boy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), very sweet and completely smitten. The other boy is Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), a model with only one thing he wants from Bianca. The dating rule makes the boys allies in getting Kat to date. Cameron and his friend Michael(David Krumholtz) find the perfect date for Kat-bad-boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger).

Lin ""SL""","[1, 6]","I had read the reviews as well as heard my friends' opinions on this movie and had thought that it would be great and witty and funny...and it was a great disappointment.Kat and Bianca are sisters in the same school, Bianca being popular and Kat the polar opposite. Popular boy Joey wants Bianca and she feels likewise. However, their dad won't let Bianca date unless Kat does...which seems impossible to him. In order to have Bianca, Joey pays Patrick to woo Kat and date her. Seeing the money, Pat goes for it, only to fall in love with Kat...even though he's still taking money. Cameron is also in love with Bianca and had planned to tell Joey to pay Pat so that when Bianca can date, she would choose him. However, his plot is foiled until the end, when Bianca realizes what a bastard Joey is.When I had seen the trailer, with Heath Ledger singing, I had thought this was when their true feelings are revealed. Little did I know that he was still taking money from Joey. This just seemed very much like betrayal to me and I didn't like that in a romantic comedy. I would never be able to forgive the guy as quickly as Kat did.Also, I felt that there were so many subplots that the movie was all over the place. It felt as if the director was trying to ram all this information into and hour and something of film. As a result, many of the subplots are underdeveloped. Such as the romance between Cameron's geeky friend and Kat's Shakespearean addict friend. Also, Cameron and Bianca barely had any chemistry and Cameron's reasons for transferring are never referred to...he was just there one day, saw Bianca and wanted her. Joey and Bianca's ""relationship"" was also very fuzzy. Not to mention the part where Kat reveals to Bianca the very reason why she hates Joey and Bianca storms out of the room in anger.The only redeeming qualities of this movie is the hilarious counselor and Kat and Bianca's father, who's comical talent is seen in this film, which is why it received two stars instead of one.",2,not as good as i expected,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,2005,"['had', 'read', 'reviews', 'as', 'well', 'heard', 'friends', 'opinions', 'movie', 'had', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'witty', 'funny', 'was', 'great', 'disappointment.Kat', 'Bianca', 'are', 'sisters', 'same', 'school', 'Bianca', 'being', 'popular', 'Kat', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Popular', 'boy', 'Joey', 'Bianca', 'likewise', 'However', 'dad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'Bianca', 'date', 'Kat', 'impossible', 'order', 'have', 'Bianca', 'Joey', 'Patrick', 'woo', 'Kat', 'date', 'Seeing', 'money', 'Pat', 'only', 'fall', 'love', 'Kat', 'even', 'still', 'taking', 'money', 'Cameron', 'also', 'love', 'Bianca', 'had', 'planned', 'tell', 'Joey', 'pay', 'Pat', 'when', 'Bianca', 'can', 'date', 'would', 'choose', 'However', 'plot', 'foiled', 'end', 'when', 'Bianca', 'what', 'bastard', 'Joey', 'is.When', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'singing', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'when', 'true', 'feelings', 'are', 'revealed', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'was', 'still', 'taking', 'money', 'Joey', 'just', 'seemed', 'very', 'much', 'betrayal', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'guy', 'as', 'quickly', 'Kat', 'did.Also', 'felt', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'subplots', 'movie', 'was', 'place', 'felt', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'ram', 'information', 'hour', 'something', 'film', 'result', 'many', 'subplots', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'Such', 'romance', 'Cameron', 'geeky', 'friend', 'Kat', 'Shakespearean', 'addict', 'friend', 'Also', 'Cameron', 'Bianca', 'barely', 'had', 'chemistry', 'Cameron', 'reasons', 'transferring', 'are', 'never', 'referred', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'one', 'day', 'saw', 'Bianca', 'wanted', 'Joey', 'Bianca', 'relationship', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'fuzzy', 'Not', 'mention', 'part', 'where', 'Kat', 'Bianca', 'very', 'reason', 'why', 'Joey', 'Bianca', 'room', 'anger.The', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'counselor', 'Kat', 'Bianca', 'father', 'who', 'comical', 'talent', 'seen', 'film', 'why', 'received', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

468619,A2QW2V285U824L,6305537798,"Steven Bailey ""Cinemaven""","[5, 42]","Seven things I hated about 10 Things I Hate About You:1. The movie's gimmick is that Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is barred by her hermetic father Walter (Larry Miller in yet another thankless role) from going on a date until Bianca's sister Katarina (Julia Stiles) decides to ever date a man. That seems pretty unlikely, given that Katarina is a male-hating, insult-spouting bundle of neurosis. Somebody involved in the movie thinks this is an original character, but I saw About Last Night... (1986), in which Elizabeth Perkins played the same sort of self- and man-hating hag. We're meant to feel sorry for this kind of character because she's been so hurt that she lashes out at the world in spite. Personally, I feel that this sort of character gets what she deserves.2. The movie thinks it's clever just by doing hip updates of William Shakespeare's comedy The Taming of the Shrew. What a pity that this movie is readily available on video, and episodes of the 1980's TV series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; are not. &quot;Moonlighting&quot; did a killer take on Shrew that had more laughs in the opening credits than are in this entire movie.3. Updating Shakespeare to modern-day high school is a nice concept, but the movie's script never develops the concept any further. Instead, it does a lot of dumb sitcom-like jokes to curry favor with the teenaged viewers most likely to rent this movie. In fact, I'd be amazed to see any high school in America that is run like the one in the movie. The teachers regularly curse out the students and get no reprisals for it. Sure!!4. Allison Janney (later to do far better in TV's &quot;The West Wing&quot;) here plays a horny guidance counselor who spends most of her job-time writing a dirty novel on her laptop.5. The Walter character is a beaut. Two daughters, and he barely lets either of them experience the real world. When one of the girls actually is allowed to go out, Walter insists she wear a &quot;pregnancy suit&quot; to remind herself of the dangers of sex. And that leads to...6. There isn't an event that isn't motivated by anything other than the urge to get a cheap, sitcom-type laugh. The guy (Heath Ledger) who eventually woos and wins Katarina can't just sing a song to Katarina--he persuades the high school band to back him up. Never mind that most high school bands need weeks of practice just to do a simple half-time-show number. And when Katarina wants to divert a teacher's attention in order to get her guy out of trouble, she flashes her breasts at the teacher in front of an entire class. Don't tell me that either Katarina's action or the teacher's reaction wouldn't send the local school board into apoplexy.7. Two women, Karen McCullough Lutz and Kirsten Smith, are credited as the screenwriters for this tripe, proving that females in Hollywood can sell out as easily as males do.One thing I do like about this movie is the climactic scene where Bianca and her boyfriend are challenged by the local macho student, and it looks like the typical &quot;two guys fighting for the girl's honor&quot; scene. Instead, Bianca takes matters into her own hands and decks Mr. Macho. In a movie with a supposedly feminist slant, this is the only scene that smacks of modern-day reality.10 Things I Hate About You is rated PG-13 for adult situations and language.",1,Seven things I hate about this movie,997488000,"08 11, 2001",2001,3325,"['Seven', 'things', 'hated', 'about', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'You:1', 'movie', 'gimmick', 'Bianca', 'Larisa', 'Oleynik', 'barred', 'hermetic', 'father', 'Walter', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'yet', 'thankless', 'role', 'going', 'date', 'Bianca', 'sister', 'Katarina', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'ever', 'date', 'man', 'pretty', 'unlikely', 'given', 'Katarina', 'male-hating', 'insult-spouting', 'bundle', 'neurosis', 'Somebody', 'involved', 'movie', 'original', 'character', 'saw', 'Last', 'Night', '1986', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'played', 'same', 'sort', 'self-', 'man-hating', 'hag', ""'re"", 'meant', 'feel', 'sorry', 'kind', 'character', 'been', 'so', 'hurt', 'out', 'world', 'spite', 'Personally', 'feel', 'sort', 'character', 'what', 'movie', 'clever', 'just', 'doing', 'hip', 'updates', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'comedy', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'What', 'pity', 'movie', 'readily', 'available', 'video', 'episodes', '1980', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Moonlighting', 'quot', 'are', 'not', 'quot', 'Moonlighting', 'quot', 'did', 'killer', 'take', 'Shrew', 'had', 'more', 'laughs', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'entire', 'movie.3', 'Updating', 'Shakespeare', 'modern-day', 'high', 'school', 'nice', 'concept', 'movie', 'script', 'never', 'concept', 'further', 'Instead', 'lot', 'dumb', 'sitcom-like', 'jokes', 'curry', 'favor', 'teenaged', 'viewers', 'most', 'likely', 'rent', 'movie', 'fact', ""'d"", 'be', 'amazed', 'see', 'high', 'school', 'America', 'run', 'one', 'movie', 'teachers', 'regularly', 'curse', 'out', 'students', 'get', 'reprisals', 'Sure', '4', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'later', 'do', 'far', 'better', 'TV', 'quot', 'West', 'Wing', 'quot', 'here', 'horny', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'who', 'most', 'job-time', 'writing', 'dirty', 'novel', 'laptop.5', 'Walter', 'character', 'beaut', 'Two', 'daughters', 'barely', 'experience', 'real', 'world', 'When', 'one', 'girls', 'actually', 'allowed', 'go', 'out', 'Walter', 'quot', 'pregnancy', 'suit', 'quot', 'remind', 'herself', 'dangers', 'sex', '6', ""n't"", 'event', ""n't"", 'motivated', 'anything', 'other', 'urge', 'get', 'cheap', 'sitcom-type', 'laugh', 'guy', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'eventually', 'woos', 'Katarina', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'sing', 'song', 'Katarina', 'high', 'school', 'band', 'back', 'up', 'Never', 'mind', 'most', 'high', 'school', 'bands', 'need', 'weeks', 'practice', 'just', 'do', 'simple', 'half-time-show', 'number', 'when', 'Katarina', 'divert', 'teacher', 'attention', 'order', 'get', 'guy', 'trouble', 'breasts', 'teacher', 'front', 'entire', 'class', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Katarina', 'action', 'teacher', 'reaction', 'would', ""n't"", 'send', 'local', 'school', 'board', 'apoplexy.7', 'Two', 'women', 'Karen', 'McCullough', 'Lutz', 'Kirsten', 'Smith', 'are', 'credited', 'screenwriters', 'tripe', 'proving', 'females', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'sell', 'out', 'as', 'easily', 'males', 'thing', 'do', 'movie', 'climactic', 'scene', 'where', 'Bianca', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'challenged', 'local', 'macho', 'student', 'typical', 'quot', 'two', 'guys', 'fighting', 'girl', 'honor', 'quot', 'scene', 'Instead', 'Bianca', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Mr.', 'Macho', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'feminist', 'slant', 'only', 'scene', 'smacks', 'modern-day', 'reality.10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'adult', 'situations', 'language']",10 Things I Hate About You VHS

In this highly acclaimed 'teen' movie, influenced by the comedy Taming of the Shrew written by William Shakespeare, the routine is still on, but with a new and refreshing twist. With unfamiliar, yet talented new faces, this brand spankin' new cast is entertaining from beginning to end.Newcomers Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger light up the screen as the potential couple who incidentally fall for each other. The stratford sisters live under strict rules stated by their strict, humorous father: Bianca, the younger, outgoing sister, cannot date until her older, anti-social sister Kat (with the perfect I-hate-the-world attitude) decides to date. As soon as Bianca attracts two fellow students, their plans on finding Kat a date lead to mishaps here and there.

It is about two sisters Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) and Katarina &quot;Kat&quot; Stratford (Julia Stiles). Bianca is the popular sister who wants to start dating a popular boy, Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan)and Kat is the social outcast. Trying to keep his daughters from dating for fear they may get pregnant, their paranoid father (Larry Miller) makes a family rule where Bianca cannot date until Kat does, which seems impossible. New kid Cameron (Joseph Gordon Levitt) has a huge crush on Bianca and, thinking Bianca likes him in return and wants to date him, he and his friend Michael Eckman (David Khumoltz) devises a scheme where they try to pair Kat off with the school &quot;Bad Boy&quot; Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger).By reading the basic plot above, you probably think this is just another Teen Flick? Well, though technically a teen flick, it lacks the shallowness that other movies of this genre have.
