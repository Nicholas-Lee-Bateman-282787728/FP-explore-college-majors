One given -- I didn't read the original version. But this is my least favorite Poirot adaptation. This is partially due to a sex scene (characters mostly clothed, but still obvious), but I just didn't like this story.

Still, the story was true to the standard Poirot mystery and the cast were all quite believeable, which is frequently a problem when films are made of Christie Mysteries. This is a serious work, although one gets a feeling that the director knew quite well that he was making this one for TV and not for the Cinema. ""The Hollow"" has long been one of my top 10 Christie mysteries and I harbor no specific complaint of this rendering. To pinpoint my review, this film/DVD is very good and a ""must buy"" for anyone who is moderately a Christie enthusiast. I should also add that the cinematography is superior and a pleasure to watch.",4,Almost 5 stars,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,719,"['thought', 'film', 'deviated', 'impression', 'book', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Still', 'story', 'was', 'true', 'standard', 'Poirot', 'mystery', 'cast', 'were', 'quite', 'believeable', 'frequently', 'problem', 'when', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'Christie', 'Mysteries', 'serious', 'work', 'one', 'feeling', 'director', 'knew', 'quite', 'well', 'was', 'making', 'one', 'TV', 'not', 'Cinema', 'Hollow', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'top', '10', 'Christie', 'mysteries', 'harbor', 'specific', 'complaint', 'rendering', 'pinpoint', 'review', 'film/DVD', 'very', 'good', 'must', 'buy', 'anyone', 'who', 'moderately', 'Christie', 'enthusiast', 'should', 'also', 'add', 'cinematography', 'superior', 'pleasure', 'watch']",Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Hollow
