W-R-O-N-G!!!  This truly IS ""Wynonna Unplugged,"" and with Italy as a backdrop - whew, the DVD is one of the few DVD's that've held my interest all-the-way-thru since..um...""the Criterion refurbishing of 'Gimme Shelter',"" or something.  Just Wy, two acoustic guitarists and an acoustic bassist (and Thank The Lord for her singers, Robert & Vicky!!!).  Yes, I could have lived w/o her weepy moments where she...""reflects"" on recent events, but the music - WOW.  INCREDIBLE.  And BTW, we also have that ""Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert (1992)"" DVD, and we were wondering who this singer, Zucchero, was - he's on here, evidentally, an opera singer of some sort (!), and just to see/hear him ""jam"" with Wy & her band on the-best-song-of-her-third-solo-CD, ""Somebody To Love You,"" is itself worth the price of the DVD.  Yes, I freely admit that I liked Wy much MUCH  better before Her Mama got sick and Wy started singing (ulp) ""adult contemporary,"" but ""Wynonna Live In Venice"" is incredible.  No slick production, no ""stings,"" just Wy and her singers and band - unplugged.  You can't ask for much more.  OH, and their version of ""How Great Thou Art,"" sung/performed in a chapel or monastery or something made me want to disclaim every snide comment I've ever made about (sic) ""Contemporary"" Christian music, too.",4,"Not bad, not bad at all!",1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,1570,"['Having', 'been', 'somewhat', 'bored', 'Wynonna', 'Don', 'Potter', 'ceased', 'being', 'main', 'musical', 'director', 'especially', 'seeing', 'live', 'was', 'set', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Wife', 'birthday', 'just', 'sort', 'leave', 'room', 'something', 'when', 'was', 'W-R-O-N-G', 'truly', 'Wynonna', 'Unplugged', 'Italy', 'backdrop', 'whew', 'DVD', 'one', 'few', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'held', 'interest', 'all-the-way-thru', 'since..um', 'Criterion', 'refurbishing', 'Gim', 'Shelter', 'something', 'Just', 'Wy', 'two', 'acoustic', 'guitarists', 'acoustic', 'bassist', 'Thank', 'Lord', 'singers', 'Robert', 'Vicky', 'Yes', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'w/o', 'weepy', 'moments', 'where', 'recent', 'events', 'music', 'WOW', 'INCREDIBLE', 'BTW', 'also', 'have', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'Tribute', 'Concert', '1992', 'DVD', 'were', 'wondering', 'who', 'singer', 'Zucchero', 'was', 'here', 'evidentally', 'opera', 'singer', 'sort', 'just', 'see/hear', 'jam', 'Wy', 'band', 'the-best-song-of-her-third-solo-CD', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'price', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'freely', 'admit', 'liked', 'Wy', 'much', 'MUCH', 'better', 'Mama', 'got', 'sick', 'Wy', 'started', 'singing', 'ulp', 'adult', 'contemporary', 'Wynonna', 'Live', 'Venice', 'incredible', 'slick', 'production', 'stings', 'just', 'Wy', 'singers', 'band', 'unplugged', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'more', 'OH', 'version', 'How', 'Great', 'Thou', 'Art', 'sung/performed', 'chapel', 'monastery', 'something', 'made', 'want', 'disclaim', 'snide', 'comment', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'made', 'sic', 'Contemporary', 'Christian', 'music', 'too']",Music in High Places - Wynonna Live in Venice
