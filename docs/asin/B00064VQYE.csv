I've been a Steve Earle fan from the moment I heard his breakthrough album, Guitar Town, in the summer of 1987. Many of the songs on this performance are from that album. I just saw Steve Earle and the Dukes at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston last week. Any long time fan of Steve Earle knows the chances he takes with his music and how he reinvents himself from time to time. I also saw his acoustic solo show last summer at the Newport Folk Festival. The differences between the 2 live shows (2004 & 2005) I saw recently and this DVD (1987) are tremendous. All three shows were very different in so many ways. All three shows were fantastic for different reasons. Last week he rocked my behind off much more than the Rolling Stones or Springsteen shows I've been to in the last few years. He played Rock, Folk, Country, Blues, and everything in between that can't be defined or labeled. This DVD doesn't quite rock out or show you that diversity, but it is precious nonetheless. It is a little more mellow and quieter than his more recent tour. But what you see here is a terrific songwriter in his earlier years, a great band and great performer give an outstanding performance. In 1987, Steve Earle was an artist shunned by country music but not marketable as a Rock and Roll suck up sell out. He was in a commerical no man's land. These days he's still shunned by some in the music industry for his political activism and songs. But screw 'em all.  Steve Earle is a true Rock and Roll artist like Johnny Cash in his later years and hasn't buckled to do the corporate music thang! This is a must have for any long time Steve Earle fan.",5,Essential for long time Steve Earles fans,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,1723,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'missed', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'PBS', 'first', 'time', 'late', '1980s', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'fan', 'moment', 'heard', 'breakthrough', 'album', 'Guitar', 'Town', 'summer', '1987', 'Many', 'songs', 'performance', 'are', 'album', 'just', 'saw', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'Dukes', 'Paradise', 'Rock', 'Club', 'Boston', 'last', 'week', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'chances', 'music', 'how', 'time', 'time', 'also', 'saw', 'acoustic', 'solo', 'show', 'last', 'summer', 'Newport', 'Folk', 'Festival', 'differences', '2', 'live', 'shows', '2004', '2005', 'saw', 'recently', 'DVD', '1987', 'are', 'tremendous', 'three', 'shows', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'three', 'shows', 'were', 'fantastic', 'different', 'reasons', 'Last', 'week', 'rocked', 'off', 'much', 'more', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Springsteen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'played', 'Rock', 'Folk', 'Country', 'Blues', 'everything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'defined', 'labeled', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rock', 'out', 'show', 'diversity', 'precious', 'nonetheless', 'little', 'more', 'mellow', 'quieter', 'more', 'recent', 'tour', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'terrific', 'songwriter', 'earlier', 'years', 'great', 'band', 'great', 'performer', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performance', '1987', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'was', 'artist', 'shunned', 'country', 'music', 'not', 'marketable', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'suck', 'up', 'sell', 'out', 'was', 'commerical', 'man', 'land', 'days', 'still', 'shunned', 'music', 'industry', 'political', 'activism', 'songs', 'screw', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'true', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'artist', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'later', 'years', ""n't"", 'buckled', 'do', 'corporate', 'music', 'thang', 'must', 'have', 'long', 'time', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'fan']",N/A
860737,A2QMRHJOWJSDOQ,B00064VQYE,"Clark Paull ""(Sleepin' with the TV on)""","[6, 7]","There was a time when I thought Steve Earle hung the moon.Back in the dark ages, I had a 90-minute Maxell mix tape I  made (from vinyl, no less) comprised of the best of his first four albums that I listened to incessantly.  Equal parts early 70's Rolling Stones, late 70's Bruce Springsteen, Hank Williams, and Johnny Cash, those four albums, with and without The Dukes, were nothing short of triumphant - scary good - and packed to the gills with tales of steel belts hummin' on the asphalt, two-pack habits, and motel tans, layered with a liberal coating of twang and unvarnished bliss.  Earle seemed poised to take over Nashville, if not the world.Maybe it was the six failed marriages, the crack addiction, or sudden career shift to yardbird, but Earle lost his way, marking a brief  near-return to the glory days with the ""Train A Comin'"" and ""I Feel Alright"" albums before apparently deciding that making some sort of grand political statement was more important than writing a really good song.  Regrettably, I gave up on him years ago.This DVD is the fleshed-out version of Earle's first ever appearance on ""Austin City Limits,"" originally edited down to 30 minutes for television broadcast, and it showcases a guy giddy with the thrill of using guitar, drums, and amps to make a beautiful noise without worrying about the global implications of making rock and roll music.  And at the risk of causing some people heartburn, make no mistake about it; this is rock and roll, not country (or at least not your daddy's country). The spark in Earle's eye, like the Great Wall of China, was probably visible from space that night, as he leads the Dukes (Ron Kling, Ken Moore, Bucky Baxter, Harry Stinson, and Mike McAdam) through a 17-song set drawing from his first two albums (""Guitar Town"" and ""Exit 0"") with just a taste of the yet-to-be-released ""Copperhead Road"" in ""The Devil's Right Hand.""There's nothing fancy here, performancewise and from a technical standpoint, from Earle's white t-shirt and jeans to the timeless, unforgettable, and life-affirming tales he pours out from a seemingly bottomless well to an utter lack of bonus features on the disc itself.  Although the performance (and lightning in a jar) captured here is nearly 20 years old, it still beats (hands down) anything that's come out of Nashville since, including Earle's last several albums.

860738,A1OA6ESXOS8MFN,B00064VQYE,Paul,"[9, 21]","Steve Earle's music ranges from the best there is anytime, anywhere to stuff that I wonder why he recorded it.  This show includes the whole gamut.  I've seen Earle play live twice, both times he wasted my money spouting off left wing political drivel that was ghastly and stupid.  Then he played more music and it was EXCELLENT.  I was looking for the latter in this DVD, and there was some excellence for sure, but it was interspersed with very ho-hum performances.  Thankfully, there were no left wing diatribes about how bad Thatcher and Reagan were.  If you're a socialist, you probably love anything Steve Earle does, but if you're anyone else, you are amazed with the brilliance of Earle when he's at his best and disgusted when he talks his horrid, ignorant politics.  This is a middle of the road production, not worth the money.  If you want to see top flight Austin City Limits stuff then get the Texas Tornados or John Hiatt Live From Austin DVDs.
