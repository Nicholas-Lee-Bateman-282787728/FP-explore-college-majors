Unbeknownst to Susan, her birth mother named Edie (Diane Ladd) has used a private investigator to track her down. Susan is aghast, especially since her adoptive parents had told her that Edie was dead. The two meet, hang out, and get close. Susan invites Edie back to her home for a visit. Unfortunately, Edie has some profound mental issues, making her manipulative, violent, and extremely dangerous! Susan has no idea what she has allowed into her life. Will Susan see through Edie's faade of normalcy in time to save her loved ones? HUSH LITTLE BABY is a gripping tale about the effects of letting a psychopath get too close. Dianne Ladd is quite believable as the murderous Edie. She makes you despise her right away. Watching her worm her way into the family, while plotting the demise of anyone she deems a threat, is a master's class on wickedness! Alas, people like Edie do exist, and if you've ever dealt w/ one of them, you already know how bad things can get...",5,"""I'm Just Trying To Add A Wee Bit Of Flavor!""...",1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,1043,"['Susan', 'Milner', 'life', 'perfect', 'husband', 'sons', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Unbeknownst', 'Susan', 'birth', 'mother', 'named', 'Edie', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'used', 'private', 'investigator', 'track', 'down', 'Susan', 'aghast', 'especially', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'had', 'told', 'Edie', 'was', 'dead', 'two', 'meet', 'hang', 'out', 'get', 'close', 'Susan', 'Edie', 'back', 'home', 'visit', 'Unfortunately', 'Edie', 'profound', 'mental', 'issues', 'making', 'manipulative', 'violent', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'Susan', 'idea', 'what', 'allowed', 'life', 'Will', 'Susan', 'see', 'Edie', 'faade', 'normalcy', 'time', 'save', 'loved', 'ones', 'HUSH', 'LITTLE', 'BABY', 'gripping', 'tale', 'effects', 'letting', 'psychopath', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'Dianne', 'Ladd', 'quite', 'believable', 'murderous', 'Edie', 'despise', 'right', 'away', 'Watching', 'worm', 'way', 'family', 'plotting', 'demise', 'anyone', 'threat', 'master', 'class', 'wickedness', 'Alas', 'people', 'Edie', 'do', 'exist', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'dealt', 'w/', 'one', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'get']",N/A

I don't know what the other people were expecting. Maybe an Oscar winning movie not a lifetime movie type. The movie is like the movie The Crush. Except it's a mother and daughter, with killing included. This movie shows that a mother will do anything to get her child back. Even if it means getting her daughter's new family out of the way!

I loved her voice and genteel way. She was on Love Boat a lot as a guest star. However, in this movie....she plays the biological mother who has finally found her daughter. Living in a slum (A retired nurse) you get the point she is on medication and is mentally off when she destroys a little boys toy.So she finds daughter. Daughter invites her to stay a couple of weeks....and Bio Mom takes over. First she kills Adopted mom with too much insulin. Really? Nobody catches on that this woman just received way more than she should have?Okay...maybe...you can let it slide. The next victim.....the family nannyy/maid.....whom she beats to death with a shovel...and buries her in the garden. Yet nobody smells a thing. I mean this crazy character is  woman in her sixties.....she isn't going to dig a real deep grave.Yet, the insanity keeps going with a couple of really yucky parts where she is trying to seduce her daughter's good looking husband....Dianne Ladd's seduction days are behind her and for them to even write it in the script is just.....eewwwwww! Nobody wants to think about &#34;grandma&#34; having sex.Finally, murderous psychotic bio mom is found out. She just goes off the deep end.....murdering the cop looking for the babysitter and daughter along with husband finally start getting a clue and opps....the body of the nanny starts poking up from the flower bed.Just when you think it cant get any hokier.....the daughter gets a phone call that her bio dad is looking for her. Really?? This is a great movie if your going to have several margaritas...with the girls and you want to just plain laugh your arse off at this movie.....without needing to watch it too closely. Other than that.......don't waste your time.",2,Bad acting and hokey beyond belief.,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,1828,"['movie', 'was', 'so', 'awful', 'Really', 'Diane', 'Ladd', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actress', 'grew', 'up', 'loved', 'voice', 'genteel', 'way', 'was', 'Love', 'Boat', 'lot', 'guest', 'star', 'However', 'movie', '.she', 'biological', 'mother', 'who', 'finally', 'found', 'daughter', 'Living', 'slum', 'retired', 'nurse', 'get', 'point', 'medication', 'mentally', 'off', 'when', 'little', 'boys', 'toy.So', 'daughter', 'Daughter', 'stay', 'couple', 'weeks', '.and', 'Bio', 'Mom', 'over', 'First', 'Adopted', 'mom', 'too', 'much', 'insulin', 'Really', 'Nobody', 'catches', 'woman', 'just', 'received', 'way', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'can', 'let', 'slide', 'next', 'victim', 'family', 'nannyy/maid', 'death', 'shovel', 'garden', 'nobody', 'thing', 'mean', 'crazy', 'character', 'woman', 'sixties', '..she', ""n't"", 'going', 'dig', 'real', 'deep', 'grave.Yet', 'insanity', 'going', 'couple', 'really', 'yucky', 'parts', 'where', 'trying', 'seduce', 'daughter', 'good', 'looking', 'husband', '.Dianne', 'Ladd', 'seduction', 'days', 'are', 'even', 'write', 'script', 'just', '..eewwwwww', 'Nobody', 'think', '34', 'grandma', '34', 'having', 'sex.Finally', 'murderous', 'psychotic', 'bio', 'mom', 'found', 'out', 'just', 'off', 'deep', 'end', '..murdering', 'cop', 'looking', 'babysitter', 'daughter', 'husband', 'finally', 'start', 'getting', 'clue', 'opps', 'body', 'nanny', 'starts', 'poking', 'up', 'flower', 'bed.Just', 'when', 'think', 'cant', 'get', 'hokier', '..the', 'daughter', 'phone', 'call', 'bio', 'dad', 'looking', 'Really', 'great', 'movie', 'going', 'have', 'several', 'margaritas', 'girls', 'want', 'just', 'plain', 'arse', 'off', 'movie', '..without', 'needing', 'watch', 'too', 'closely', 'Other', '.do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",N/A
