All part of the charm and entertainment amidst suspense. If you are new to Murdoch, catch yourself up with the new set:Murdoch Mysteries Collection: Seasons 1-4.You can view season 5 as a stand-alone season, but trust me, you DO WANT every episodes.Yannick Bisson's leading Murdoch role is rejoined with his boss, Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), Crabtree (Jonny Harris), in all episodes; and Dr. Ogden (Helen Joy) in most episodes. Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch) misses only one. A bright new star in coroner Dr. Grace (Georgina Reilly). Her saucy flair turns Crabtree's eye. Mine too!SDH SUBTITLES for all 13 episodes, each near 50 min.Season 5 (2012) episode synopses--without spoilers--if you like detail.1 Murdoch of the Klondike --Dawson City gold fever dwindles, Murdoch tries forgetting unrequited love. He's befriended by Jack (Aaron Ashmore). In Toronto newly promoted Chief Constable Giles (Nigel Bennett) gets pushy. Can Murdoch clear Elizabeth (Jill Halfpenny) of murder?2 Back and to the Left -An Irish Catholic suspected of a murder in a failed Protestant Mayor parade assassination. Murdoch & Dr. Ogden work closely--too close. Constabulary confiscates cameras and considers bullet trajectories (Reminiscent of JFKennedy & Dallas).3 Evil Eye of Egypt --Ultraviolet light reveals a clue to deaths linked to Egyptian antiquities. Is it a mummy's curse as Crabtree's new novel, ""The Curse of the Pharaohs,"" suggests? His writing fame is comic, amid the diabolical mystery.4 War on Terror --A homemade incendiary bomb explodes a shop & knocks about Crabtree and Higgins. Canada gov. man Meyers is responsible for security to a pending U.S.President McKinley's visit. Meyers is played by Peter Keleghan, Red Green Show ranger, and he has an annual appearance in a Murdoch episode. Also a romance buds. Matthew Bennett plays Clegg, anarchist or US agent?5 Murdoch at the Opera --Understudy singer poisoned in rehearsal. Was Rosa the intended victim? Surprise opera fan, Brackenreid is bodyguard volunteer to the diva--thus causing his wife's (Arwen Humphreys) jealousy.6 Who Killed the Electric Carriage? --Battery inventor murdered, perhaps by an electric vehicle designer (Peter Stebbings). Just as likely a suspect is Henry (Todd Hofley) Henry Ford. Is Brackenreid's wife now unfaithful? Crabtree spies to find out.7 & 8 Stroll on the Wild Side parts 1 and 2 --The abduction of Lucille Messing (Tori Anderson), librarian with a secret past.  Murdoch's former love, librarian alias Anna Fulford (Lisa Faulkner), once ran away from the Black Hand crime syndicate. Dr. Ogden's jailed for illegally instructing in contraceptives, the act also opposed by her husband, Darcy (Jonathan Watton). Constabulary station #4 fields a baseball team. A most creative finale.9 Invention Convention --See many early inventions while a disliked suction cleaner inventor Karl Schreyer is shot during his winner's speech at a convention--this after telling Murdoch of the threat. Can Alexander Graham Bell (John Tench; ep. 9 & 11) provide clues. Arguably the best Murdoch episode ever.10 Staircase to Heaven --A guest in a remote house is murdered, in front of another guest, Dr. Grace. At Station 4, Brackenreid and Crabtree guard Watts, a man turning evidence against a killer--if they can.11 Murdoch in Toyland --A kidnapped child is swapped with an Edison talking doll. The doll asks Murdoch to play. Dr. Ogden visits Station 4 (or is it the detective?) and suggests revenge with Murdoch as target.  Mike Senter returns from 2009, again playing Gillies12 Murdoch Night in Canada --A hockey player is killed in the locker room. Driscoll (Jake Epstein), Crabtree's friend who wed Lydia, Crabtree's former love, is suspect, making relationships awkward. Dr. Grace has her own problems with her ex-fiance, also hockey player (Mark O'Brien).13 Twentieth Century Murdoch --Gideon Turner (Joe Cobden) attacks Brackenreid, prevents a Santa from shooting a man, claiming he's a time traveler via Prof. Harms' (Colin Buchanan- D. I. Pascoe) time machine. Romantic threads aplenty in the 1899 Christmas stockings. Crabtree wants a date to the New Year's Ball. Brackenreid gets an Ottawa job offer.

Most detective dramas drag you through the darkest and most twisted gutters of crime, violence, and human depravity--and often leave you there.  Murdoch Mysteries retains only the necessary suspense and shock of the reality of crime, and homicide in particular, but, as do the best of this genre, focuses on the mental acumen required to unravel mysteries and find perpetrators--and save and protect the innocent.  The leading characters are imperfect, but so likeable.  There is an endearing quality of Victorian prudishness, and a focus on morality that is actually refreshing to see on the screen.  Watching the series, I feel like the creators have combined The Wild Wild West, Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, and probably a few other entertaining gems into a new and enjoyable amalgam which shares the best of its predecessors, but offers a new direction and original experience.
