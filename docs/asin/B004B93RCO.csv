The jokes are a bit more stale and the presentations are uneven, coming as they are from various comedians, each with their own short solos. Leary's solo act about ED drugs was quintessential Leary though, and worth the cost of the DVD all by itself.",3,Not the best.,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,357,"['not', 'Leary', 'stand-up', 'concert', 'Granted', 'knew', 'going', 'was', 'still', 'expecting', 'more', 'Leary', 'jokes', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'stale', 'presentations', 'are', 'uneven', 'coming', 'are', 'various', 'comedians', 'own', 'short', 'solos', 'Leary', 'solo', 'act', 'ED', 'drugs', 'was', 'quintessential', 'Leary', 'though', 'cost', 'DVD']",Denis Leary and Friends Present: Douchebags & Donuts
