1595921,A8RSEDOMNXPH1,B009EAALEW,Bruce Dawson,"[4, 6]","Being a huge CI fan, and loving his Beyond The Sun CD set, I was really looking forward to this DVD of the Beyond The Sun concert.  But this isn't it.  This is a very badly put together DVD.  No opening credits, it is filmed on 3 different stages, there is only about 2 songs from the Beyond the Sun album, and the rest are the traditional CI favorites filmed and released for about the 5th time.  The crowd shots are endless, and rather sad to see that CI's fan base now consists of 40+ year olds looking for a early night so they can get home before the baby sitter's go into golden time.  On the music side, the band is as great as ever, the performances first rate!  It's just the song selection, and billing the disk as Beyond The Sun Live is certainly misleading.  Leave this one alone.",2,Very Disappointing!,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,792,"['Being', 'huge', 'CI', 'fan', 'loving', 'Beyond', 'Sun', 'CD', 'set', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'Beyond', 'Sun', 'concert', ""n't"", 'very', 'badly', 'put', 'together', 'DVD', 'No', 'opening', 'credits', 'filmed', '3', 'different', 'stages', 'only', 'about', '2', 'songs', 'Beyond', 'Sun', 'album', 'rest', 'are', 'traditional', 'CI', 'favorites', 'filmed', 'released', '5th', 'time', 'crowd', 'shots', 'are', 'endless', 'rather', 'sad', 'see', 'CI', 'fan', 'base', 'now', '40+', 'year', 'olds', 'looking', 'early', 'night', 'can', 'get', 'home', 'baby', 'sitter', 'go', 'golden', 'time', 'music', 'side', 'band', 'as', 'great', 'ever', 'performances', 'first', 'rate', 'just', 'song', 'selection', 'billing', 'disk', 'Beyond', 'Sun', 'Live', 'certainly', 'misleading', 'Leave', 'one', 'alone']",N/A
