871594,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B0006OBPTA,Allen Chapman,"[2, 2]","If you're like me you'll be buying this mostly to get the first film in widescreen. Or if you're not like me you're buying this because you're a big fan of ""The Next Karate Kid""!!!  Seriously though the main appeal of this set for me was to get the first film in widescreen. I wasn't however, expecting the running commentary to be as fun as it is. Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita and the director and the writer are all on hand to provide insight. What makes the commentary so great is that unlike some commentaries they are able to laugh at certain scenes and point out things that even they thought were unbelieveable (the scene with the bottles on the truck). Morita and Macchio clearly formed a strong bond making the movies and their admiration for one another shows in the commentary. Since it is the first film that will be the draw here, that is the disc with all the bells and whistles. The other three films have no extras to speak of. By now everyone knows the story of Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and the powerful friendship they build. I was 13 when the first film came out and watching it again after 20 years it still packs a punch or should I say a kick! You'll want this set for the first film and maybe the second. I've never seen the third or fourth so I can't comment on those two. But it is a nice set and a great film of believing in oneself and the power of friendship.",4,The first film makes this set worth it!,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,1381,"[""'re"", ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'mostly', 'get', 'first', 'film', 'widescreen', ""'re"", 'not', ""'re"", 'buying', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Next', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Seriously', 'main', 'appeal', 'set', 'was', 'get', 'first', 'film', 'widescreen', 'was', ""n't"", 'however', 'expecting', 'running', 'commentary', 'be', 'as', 'fun', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'director', 'writer', 'are', 'hand', 'provide', 'insight', 'What', 'commentary', 'so', 'great', 'commentaries', 'are', 'able', 'laugh', 'certain', 'scenes', 'point', 'out', 'things', 'even', 'thought', 'were', 'unbelieveable', 'scene', 'bottles', 'truck', 'Morita', 'Macchio', 'clearly', 'formed', 'strong', 'bond', 'making', 'movies', 'admiration', 'one', 'commentary', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'draw', 'here', 'disc', 'bells', 'whistles', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'extras', 'speak', 'now', 'everyone', 'story', 'Daniel', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'powerful', 'friendship', 'build', 'was', '13', 'when', 'first', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'watching', 'again', '20', 'years', 'still', 'punch', 'should', 'say', 'kick', ""'ll"", 'want', 'set', 'first', 'film', 'maybe', 'second', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'third', 'fourth', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'two', 'nice', 'set', 'great', 'film', 'believing', 'power', 'friendship']",The Karate Kid Collection: Four Film Set

It was very special for me to hear Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita discussing this film 20 years after it first hit theaters and warmed it's way into our hearts. I have loved this movie for 20 years straight. I was a Ralph Macchio fanatic at 8 years of age and I still think this is such a fantastic movie. The DVD is superb. The commentary is the number one feature. It's informative, interesting, and highly entertaining. There are a few featurettes that are enjoyable as well. No deleted scenes though! And where the heck was Elisabeth Shue during the making of this? Oh well, other than that I reccommend anyone who loves this movie to pick up this new box set.

871603,AJ8VUUCO9RMX6,B0006OBPTA,"D.L. ""generasian""","[4, 4]","There are only a handful of movies that I associate with my youth while growing up in the 80's.  ""The Karate Kid"" was definately one of them.  By taking a seemingly cliched premise about the student being taught by the master to avenge his honor, the filmmakers were able to inject a lot of warmth, humor and heart into the movie to make it an entirely unforgettable film.  Unfortunately, the sequels (as they rarely do) never lived up to the original with the fourth one (starring a young Hilary Swank) being a parody of itself.  But rather than bore you with inane details as to what I loved and hated about each film, I will describe the special features, which is the only reason to put up with the last two sequels.  A treat for ""The Karate Kid"" fans is a forty-five minute documentary on the filmmaking process from its origins to the final cut.  It was great seeing Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Martin Kove (Kreese) and William Zabka (Johnny) as they are today, describing their experiences while making the film.  Hearing Kove admit that his initial dislike for the director helped him to channel his character's anger was great. The ""East Meets West: A Composer's Notebook"" and ""Life of Bonsai"" featurette were basically fillers and only added trivial information about the film.  However, I was a little disappointed that the same amount of features weren't found on ""The Karate Kid, Part II,"" nor the other sequels, as bad as they were.  But it's the first film that I hold close to my heart and with the great features and affordable price, the collection is well worth the price.",4,Prepare to ride the wave of nostalgia...,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,1590,"['are', 'only', 'handful', 'movies', 'associate', 'youth', 'growing', 'up', '80', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'was', 'definately', 'one', 'taking', 'seemingly', 'cliched', 'premise', 'student', 'being', 'taught', 'master', 'avenge', 'honor', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'able', 'inject', 'lot', 'warmth', 'humor', 'heart', 'movie', 'make', 'entirely', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'sequels', 'rarely', 'do', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'original', 'fourth', 'one', 'starring', 'young', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'being', 'parody', 'rather', 'bore', 'inane', 'details', 'what', 'loved', 'hated', 'film', 'will', 'describe', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'reason', 'put', 'up', 'last', 'two', 'sequels', 'treat', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'fans', 'forty-five', 'minute', 'documentary', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'origins', 'final', 'cut', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Martin', 'Kove', 'Kreese', 'William', 'Zabka', 'Johnny', 'are', 'today', 'describing', 'experiences', 'making', 'film', 'Hearing', 'Kove', 'admit', 'initial', 'dislike', 'director', 'helped', 'channel', 'character', 'anger', 'was', 'great', 'East', 'Meets', 'West', 'Composer', 'Notebook', 'Life', 'Bonsai', 'featurette', 'were', 'basically', 'fillers', 'only', 'added', 'trivial', 'information', 'film', 'However', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'same', 'amount', 'features', 'were', ""n't"", 'found', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Part', 'II', 'other', 'sequels', 'as', 'bad', 'were', 'first', 'film', 'hold', 'close', 'heart', 'great', 'features', 'affordable', 'price', 'collection', 'well', 'price']",The Karate Kid Collection: Four Film Set

Avlidsen (""Rocky""; he directed the first three movies). Pat Morita (who won Best Supporting Actor for the first movie) stars in all four.The first movie is a lot of fun, with the famous ""Wax on, wax off"" sequence. It is also the film debut of Elizabeth Shue. I loved the romantic subplot. The fight seequences are well-executed.The second film starts going into dark territory, beginning with the aftermath of the competition that concludes the first film. Why Elizabeth Shue didn't return is a mystery to me, though I loved the new interest. Once again, the action scenes were top-notch.

Cleverly edited clips from the first two movies serve as the prologue to this""Revenge Of The Sith""-style installment. The best one yet. They keep getting better and better.

The direction was God-awful. (John G. Avlidsen didn't direct; I don't know why).

871612,A3DUY3FHH21T3T,B0006OBPTA,HereWeGo,"[0, 0]","The karate kid, this movie is a classic and the story all begin's with a boy, namely daniel larusso who lived in new jersey, rasita with his mom lucille larusso. When her husband died of unknown causes her and son move to Los angeles, where daniel starts to encounter problems fitting into school and dealing with a group of bullies who go by the names of tommy, jimmy, bobby, dutch and johnny who formed together go by the name of the cobra kai's, who are all best friend's and do karate together at the cobra kai dojo taught by the legendary sensai john kreese and take a disliking to daniel and from there bully him on a daily basis until one night an old man &#34;mr. miyagi&#34; who happens to be the apartment maintenance man saves daniel from a brutal confrontation. After saving daniel, mr. miyagi then teaches daniel the fundamentals of karate and that pretty much sets the tone for the first movie.Karate kid part 2, practically picks of immediately where the original left off and starts of after the tournament, as the story progress mr. miyagi receives sad news of his father's death and leaves america to okinawa, japan where daniel learns the history of karate where unfortunately both daniel and miyagi encounter new rivals.Karate kid part 3, well it kinda goes back to the original formula where daniel is still the all valley champion and has captured the eyes of an business man terry silver who seeks to get revenge on both daniel and mr. miyagi for what he believes have become the ruin of sensai john kreese's life and enlists the help of a new karate contender mike barnes.Karate Kid part 4 - next karate kid, sees the departure of daniel larusso and a new story emerge as a new girl julie pierce who goes to a new school and encounters many problems with the outside world all around her as well as being anti social. Julie pierce soon starts attracting the attention of 2 boys, one of which is nice who want's to get know her and the other who acts like an ass and shows nothing but brawn to get her attention which later becomes lethal.Overall review, the karate kid movies from part 1-2 are quite solid and sets the tone for the whole karate kid saga with daniel learning the basics and then in the sequel learn it's history which was great but sadly seemed to have drop the ball by the 3rd movie but still however gives an important lesson which was to keep a cool head under pressure and learn to pick your battles however by the time of the 4th movie my estimates was that the karate kid hype was already over. The karate kid part 4 was pretty much more or less a stand alone movie even though it had mr. miyagi in it didn't coarse in terms of the story line and pretty much was unbelievable at times like julie having a fight with man practically stronger than her in the final scene.The karate kid box set would be an excellent product to own for yourself or the family it's good for people of all ages and is definitely a timeless classic that will never get out of style",5,"Strike Hard, Strike Fast.....A Review Deserves No Mercy",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,3004,"['karate', 'kid', 'movie', 'classic', 'story', 'begin', 'boy', 'namely', 'daniel', 'larusso', 'who', 'lived', 'new', 'jersey', 'rasita', 'mom', 'lucille', 'larusso', 'When', 'husband', 'died', 'unknown', 'causes', 'son', 'move', 'Los', 'angeles', 'where', 'daniel', 'encounter', 'problems', 'fitting', 'school', 'dealing', 'group', 'bullies', 'who', 'go', 'names', 'tommy', 'jimmy', 'bobby', 'dutch', 'johnny', 'who', 'formed', 'together', 'go', 'name', 'cobra', 'kai', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'friend', 'do', 'karate', 'together', 'cobra', 'kai', 'dojo', 'taught', 'legendary', 'sensai', 'john', 'kreese', 'take', 'disliking', 'daniel', 'bully', 'daily', 'basis', 'one', 'night', 'old', 'man', '34', 'mr.', 'miyagi', '34', 'who', 'be', 'apartment', 'maintenance', 'man', 'daniel', 'brutal', 'confrontation', 'saving', 'daniel', 'mr.', 'miyagi', 'then', 'daniel', 'fundamentals', 'karate', 'pretty', 'much', 'tone', 'first', 'movie.Karate', 'kid', 'part', '2', 'practically', 'picks', 'immediately', 'where', 'original', 'left', 'off', 'starts', 'tournament', 'story', 'progress', 'mr.', 'miyagi', 'sad', 'news', 'father', 'death', 'america', 'okinawa', 'japan', 'where', 'daniel', 'history', 'karate', 'where', 'unfortunately', 'daniel', 'miyagi', 'encounter', 'new', 'rivals.Karate', 'kid', 'part', '3', 'well', 'back', 'original', 'formula', 'where', 'daniel', 'still', 'valley', 'champion', 'captured', 'eyes', 'business', 'man', 'terry', 'silver', 'who', 'get', 'revenge', 'daniel', 'mr.', 'miyagi', 'what', 'have', 'become', 'ruin', 'sensai', 'john', 'kreese', 'life', 'help', 'new', 'karate', 'contender', 'mike', 'barnes.Karate', 'Kid', 'part', '4', 'next', 'karate', 'kid', 'departure', 'daniel', 'larusso', 'new', 'story', 'emerge', 'new', 'girl', 'julie', 'pierce', 'who', 'new', 'school', 'encounters', 'many', 'problems', 'outside', 'world', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'anti', 'social', 'Julie', 'pierce', 'soon', 'attracting', 'attention', '2', 'boys', 'one', 'nice', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'who', 'ass', 'nothing', 'brawn', 'get', 'attention', 'later', 'lethal.Overall', 'review', 'karate', 'kid', 'movies', 'part', '1-2', 'are', 'quite', 'solid', 'tone', 'whole', 'karate', 'kid', 'saga', 'daniel', 'learning', 'basics', 'then', 'sequel', 'learn', 'history', 'was', 'great', 'sadly', 'seemed', 'have', 'drop', 'ball', '3rd', 'movie', 'still', 'however', 'important', 'lesson', 'was', 'keep', 'cool', 'head', 'pressure', 'learn', 'pick', 'battles', 'however', 'time', '4th', 'movie', 'estimates', 'was', 'karate', 'kid', 'hype', 'was', 'already', 'karate', 'kid', 'part', '4', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'more', 'less', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'even', 'had', 'mr.', 'miyagi', 'did', ""n't"", 'coarse', 'terms', 'story', 'line', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'times', 'julie', 'having', 'fight', 'man', 'practically', 'stronger', 'final', 'scene.The', 'karate', 'kid', 'box', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'product', 'own', 'family', 'good', 'people', 'ages', 'definitely', 'timeless', 'classic', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'style']",The Karate Kid Collection: Four Film Set

The first two films are available on Blu-ray now but this is the only set to contain the quadrilogy (the 2010 remake is not included). The Next Karate Kid wasn't quite as good though it did have Mr. Miyagi returning to coach a young girl. The picture and audio quality in this set is fairly good. The problem is that there aren't many extras overall (less than 2 hours) and none of the sequels get any treatment. If you own the original film already you aren't getting any added value here. Ultimately, this is the economy set for KK fans who want the quadrilogy in one set because the price is right. If you are only interested in the original you may consider purchasing it separately on the 2010 stand-alone Blu-ray (with the same extras included here). Those interested in at least two of the sequels will get their money's worth. The Karate Kid franchise deserves a deluxe Blu-ray with 6 hours of bonus supplements.

This is where all the trouble begins!He falls for a cute blonde named Ali who is the girlfriend of champion Johnny Lawrence who is the best student at the Cobra-Kai karate dojo. Oddly, Johnny is not exactly a traditional villian per-se like some of his friends seem to be. It basically is a love-triangle sort of situation. Obviously, Johnny has the edge as he is bigger and much more skilled than Daniel. But Daniel has a secret weapon that everyone soon finds out about. He befriends an elderly Japanese karate grandmaster and war hero named Mr. Miyagi. Mr. Miyagi is well aware of Daniel's situation and expresses to teach him all the tricks to defeat Johnny and his friends at a tournament which he sets up with Johnny's ruthless instructor, Kreese.The second film takes place in Japan. Daniel takes a vacation with Mr. Miyagi and ends up not only learning about Japanese culture but fighting for his life as Mr. Miyagi's long-time rival and one time best friend, Sato along with his first-rated student challenge the two. This paves way for the third film with is again based on a tournament. In my opinion, this really should have been released after the first as it seems to be more of a direct sequel to the first than the second film was. It picks up where the first tournament ends. Kreese turns on Johnny for having lost to Daniel and starts to choke him. Mr. Miyagi jumps to Johnny's rescue which persuades Kreese to throw a couple of punches at him! However, Mr. Miyagi proves very elusive to hit and he ends up severely injuring both of his hands due to accidentally hitting two car windows instead. Mr. Miyagi has the opportunity to give Kreese a severe beating due to his handicap but decides to let him go and forgive him.Kreese, humiliated and now without students opts to consider giving up karate. But his war-buddy and vicious karate instructor, Terry who is also his partner discovers the situation and vows to help Kreese put an end to Mr. Miyagi and Daniel's championship reign. He handpicks a great Cobra-Kai type martial artist named Mike Barnes. Terry makes Barnes a great offer providing he can defeat Daniel which persuades him to really attack Daniel with a viciousness that very much intimidates him. Daniel really wants to continue fighting in tournaments but Mr. Miyagi advises against it as he believes karate is more so for defending life and honor rather than his trophy! This forces Daniel to choose another instructor who happens to be Terry! Terry pretends to be his best friend and on his side but puts him through such physically demanding training that it drains Daniel and turns him into a vicious Cobra-Kai with an attitude.He ends up mistreating Mr. Miyagi and breaking someones face in a street fight. Daniel finally sees he is being someone he's not and returns to Mr. Miyagi who finally promises to train him. I really did enjoy this one but I do agree with the other review on here that Mike Barnes didn't have the charisma of Johnny or even Chozen. In my opinion, they should have brought Johnny back to fight along side with Daniel getting revenge against Kreese for choking and mistreating him! Also, if you remember, he did sort of make amends with Daniel at the end of part 1 and Mr. Miyagi did save his life. It would have been really interesting to see how Mr. Miyagi would've trained Johnny.",5,One of the greatest film series ever!!,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,3780,"['Well', 'must', 'say', 'do', 'own', 'first', 'three', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'films', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'fourth', 'one', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'did', 'hear', 'was', 'weakest', 'series', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'now', ""'ll"", 'start', 'first', 'film', 'course', 'best', 'one', 'great', 'plot', 'teen-age', 'boy', 'named', 'Daniel', 'who', 'very', 'kind-hearted', 'deep', 'interest', 'karate', 'relocates', 'New', 'Jersey', 'California', 'mom', 'where', 'trouble', 'cute', 'blonde', 'named', 'Ali', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'champion', 'Johnny', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'best', 'student', 'Cobra-Kai', 'karate', 'dojo', 'Oddly', 'Johnny', 'not', 'exactly', 'traditional', 'villian', 'per-se', 'friends', 'seem', 'be', 'basically', 'love-triangle', 'sort', 'situation', 'Obviously', 'Johnny', 'edge', 'bigger', 'much', 'more', 'skilled', 'Daniel', 'Daniel', 'secret', 'weapon', 'everyone', 'soon', 'out', 'about', 'elderly', 'Japanese', 'karate', 'grandmaster', 'war', 'hero', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'well', 'aware', 'Daniel', 'situation', 'teach', 'tricks', 'defeat', 'Johnny', 'friends', 'tournament', 'up', 'Johnny', 'ruthless', 'instructor', 'Kreese.The', 'second', 'film', 'place', 'Japan', 'Daniel', 'vacation', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'learning', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'fighting', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'long-time', 'rival', 'one', 'time', 'best', 'friend', 'Sato', 'first-rated', 'student', 'challenge', 'two', 'way', 'third', 'film', 'again', 'based', 'tournament', 'opinion', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'first', 'be', 'more', 'direct', 'sequel', 'first', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'tournament', 'ends', 'Kreese', 'Johnny', 'having', 'lost', 'Daniel', 'choke', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Johnny', 'rescue', 'Kreese', 'throw', 'couple', 'punches', 'However', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'very', 'elusive', 'hit', 'up', 'severely', 'injuring', 'hands', 'due', 'accidentally', 'hitting', 'two', 'car', 'windows', 'instead', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'opportunity', 'give', 'Kreese', 'severe', 'beating', 'due', 'handicap', 'let', 'go', 'forgive', 'him.Kreese', 'humiliated', 'now', 'students', 'opts', 'consider', 'giving', 'up', 'karate', 'war-buddy', 'vicious', 'karate', 'instructor', 'Terry', 'who', 'also', 'partner', 'situation', 'vows', 'help', 'Kreese', 'put', 'end', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Daniel', 'championship', 'reign', 'great', 'Cobra-Kai', 'type', 'martial', 'artist', 'named', 'Mike', 'Barnes', 'Terry', 'Barnes', 'great', 'offer', 'providing', 'can', 'defeat', 'Daniel', 'really', 'attack', 'Daniel', 'viciousness', 'very', 'much', 'Daniel', 'really', 'continue', 'fighting', 'tournaments', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'karate', 'more', 'so', 'defending', 'life', 'honor', 'rather', 'trophy', 'Daniel', 'choose', 'instructor', 'who', 'be', 'Terry', 'Terry', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'side', 'such', 'physically', 'demanding', 'training', 'Daniel', 'vicious', 'Cobra-Kai', 'attitude.He', 'up', 'mistreating', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'breaking', 'someones', 'face', 'street', 'fight', 'Daniel', 'finally', 'being', 'someone', 'not', 'returns', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'who', 'finally', 'train', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'one', 'do', 'agree', 'other', 'review', 'here', 'Mike', 'Barnes', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'charisma', 'Johnny', 'even', 'Chozen', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'brought', 'Johnny', 'back', 'fight', 'along', 'side', 'Daniel', 'getting', 'revenge', 'Kreese', 'choking', 'mistreating', 'Also', 'remember', 'did', 'sort', 'make', 'amends', 'Daniel', 'end', 'part', '1', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'did', 'save', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'would', ""'ve"", 'trained', 'Johnny']",The Karate Kid Collection: Four Film Set

The story was excellent, and Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita brought such chemistry to the unique relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Actually, the entire cast in this movie was excellent - Randee Heller was superb as Daniel's mom, and even the actors with smaller parts brought credibility to this movie. I still get chills at the end of this movie. The extras on this DVD were a nice touch as well.The Karate Kid II is the less inspired sequel, but it still has some of the magic from the first one. The third installment was a bit strained - how many different groups of individuals are going to torment Daniel (on two different continents no less), but it is still worth watching.The Next Karate Kid was, in my opinion, uninspired and made me miss the magic of Daniel and Miyagi's relationship.Overall, this four disc set is a must-have for any fan of this series.

871633,AAJGG0PD8C7GU,B0006OBPTA,"Rich King's Breakfast Nook ""Gretna is a great...","[3, 4]","I was finally told last week that you could get all of the karate kid movies in one set packed with special features. When I was told this, I hugged the kid working and tipped him $20 bucks for the information. Needless to say, I bought it and was blown away by the purchase price. These are worth at least $150 to me. Let me try to put into words how incredible it is to have these four movies in one collection. I like to eat fried appetizers. This box set is the equivalent of putting breaded cauliflower, breaded mushrooms, fried cheese sticks and chicken tenders on one platter with all of your favorite sauces. The only way to review this is one by one. I spent the entire holiday weekend watching these films a total of 26 times(I watched 1 and 2 nine times to just eight for part 3. I'll explain part four later).Part 1- The best of the best of the best. Ralph Macchio was brilliant in the outsiders and someone in hollywood saw that film and went,""I've got this teen karate movie script and you need to get me Macchio."". Well, they got Macchio and magic was born. I still don't know what angered the Cobra Kai so much about Daniel San, but they just flat didn't like the Jersey kid. I guess I understand a bit because Bon Jovi's attitude kind of rubbed me the wrong way. So he's getting beat up left and right until the Maintenance Man with off the charts karate skills wipes out all of the cobra Kai at once. Anyway, Daniel does chores and in a week or so is a Karate machine himself. He pretty much has to take out the whole Cobra Kai by himself, one at a time, include the black Cobra Kai kid played to perfection by the great Larry B. Scott(Lavar from Revenge of the Nerds). I won't give away the ending but let's just say you won't try that with your girlfriend!!Part 2- Daniel has the respect of everyone in town, but still no friends so he goes to Japan with Myagi. Guess what, more trouble. Some kid in Japan evidentally doesn't like Daniel San either and wants to kill him. What you, the viewer, will realize in this film is that this is not tournament, this real life. Daniel falls in love with a spicy little asian number and helps save people from hurricanes. It all comes down to a showdown between Daniel and Japan karate kid and I won't give away the ending again, but you'd better finish that laundry!!!Part 3- Some people really keep a grudge. Evil Sinsay John Creese of the Cobra Kai is still hacked off that the gangly dork with no friends from New Jersey beat the tar out of all of his guys including Larry B. Scott. Even Dutch got his butt handed to him by Daniel San. Creese's plot for revenge involves a mean karate champ(who seriously would kill Daniel san in real life) and a rich guy with nothing to do. I think the toughest part to watch in the whole four part series is when the karate bully and his friends break Daniel's bansai tree. Daniel cries, his chick cries, and yes, I cry. It's tough to make it through. Well if you want to tick off Daniel San, screw with his bansai tree. It's go time!! I won't give away the ending but let's just say this was Ralph Macchio's last karate kid movie!!Part 4- I don't know why this one was put in the box. The chick that plays the girl that pretends to be a boy is supposedly the Karate kid. I took it back to target and asked why Ralph Macchio is not in the fourth movie. He claimed not to know and made fun of me to a coworker. For whatever reason, Macchio was not in this picture in the box set I bought. Hopefully he's in the one you buy. I didn't watch this one.",5,Are you kidding me?,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,3546,"['was', 'finally', 'told', 'last', 'week', 'could', 'get', 'karate', 'kid', 'movies', 'one', 'set', 'packed', 'special', 'features', 'When', 'was', 'told', 'hugged', 'kid', 'working', 'tipped', '20', 'bucks', 'information', 'Needless', 'say', 'bought', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'purchase', 'price', 'are', 'worth', 'least', '150', 'Let', 'try', 'put', 'words', 'how', 'incredible', 'have', 'four', 'movies', 'one', 'collection', 'like', 'eat', 'fried', 'appetizers', 'box', 'set', 'equivalent', 'putting', 'breaded', 'cauliflower', 'breaded', 'mushrooms', 'fried', 'cheese', 'sticks', 'chicken', 'tenders', 'one', 'platter', 'favorite', 'sauces', 'only', 'way', 'review', 'one', 'one', 'spent', 'entire', 'holiday', 'weekend', 'watching', 'films', 'total', '26', 'times', 'watched', '1', '2', 'nine', 'times', 'just', 'eight', 'part', '3', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'part', 'four', 'later', '1-', 'best', 'best', 'best', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'was', 'brilliant', 'outsiders', 'someone', 'hollywood', 'saw', 'film', 'went', ""'ve"", 'got', 'teen', 'karate', 'movie', 'script', 'need', 'get', 'Macchio.', 'Well', 'got', 'Macchio', 'magic', 'was', 'born', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'angered', 'Cobra', 'Kai', 'so', 'much', 'Daniel', 'San', 'just', 'flat', 'did', ""n't"", 'Jersey', 'kid', 'guess', 'understand', 'bit', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'attitude', 'kind', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'left', 'right', 'Maintenance', 'Man', 'off', 'charts', 'karate', 'skills', 'cobra', 'Kai', 'once', 'Anyway', 'Daniel', 'chores', 'week', 'so', 'Karate', 'machine', 'pretty', 'much', 'take', 'out', 'whole', 'Cobra', 'Kai', 'one', 'time', 'include', 'black', 'Cobra', 'Kai', 'kid', 'played', 'perfection', 'great', 'Larry', 'B.', 'Scott', 'Lavar', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'girlfriend', 'Part', '2-', 'Daniel', 'respect', 'everyone', 'town', 'still', 'friends', 'so', 'Japan', 'Myagi', 'Guess', 'what', 'more', 'trouble', 'kid', 'Japan', 'evidentally', ""n't"", 'like', 'Daniel', 'San', 'kill', 'What', 'viewer', 'will', 'realize', 'film', 'not', 'tournament', 'real', 'life', 'Daniel', 'love', 'spicy', 'little', 'asian', 'number', 'save', 'people', 'hurricanes', 'down', 'showdown', 'Daniel', 'Japan', 'karate', 'kid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'again', ""'d"", 'better', 'finish', 'laundry', 'Part', '3-', 'people', 'really', 'keep', 'grudge', 'Evil', 'Sinsay', 'John', 'Creese', 'Cobra', 'Kai', 'still', 'hacked', 'off', 'gangly', 'dork', 'friends', 'New', 'Jersey', 'beat', 'tar', 'guys', 'including', 'Larry', 'B.', 'Scott', 'Even', 'Dutch', 'got', 'butt', 'handed', 'Daniel', 'San', 'Creese', 'plot', 'revenge', 'mean', 'karate', 'champ', 'who', 'seriously', 'would', 'kill', 'Daniel', 'san', 'real', 'life', 'rich', 'guy', 'nothing', 'do', 'think', 'toughest', 'part', 'watch', 'whole', 'four', 'part', 'series', 'when', 'karate', 'bully', 'friends', 'break', 'Daniel', 'bansai', 'tree', 'Daniel', 'cries', 'chick', 'cries', 'yes', 'cry', 'tough', 'make', 'Well', 'want', 'tick', 'off', 'Daniel', 'San', 'screw', 'bansai', 'tree', 'go', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'last', 'karate', 'kid', 'movie', 'Part', '4-', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'one', 'was', 'put', 'box', 'chick', 'girl', 'be', 'boy', 'supposedly', 'Karate', 'kid', 'took', 'back', 'target', 'asked', 'why', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'not', 'fourth', 'movie', 'claimed', 'not', 'know', 'made', 'fun', 'coworker', 'reason', 'Macchio', 'was', 'not', 'picture', 'box', 'set', 'bought', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'buy', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one']",The Karate Kid Collection: Four Film Set

871637,AECXFCX8CW6HE,B0006OBPTA,"Ryan Anonymus ""Ryan""","[2, 5]","Ah, Karate Kid.  A good movie.  There were too many things given to the viewers in Karate Kid (part one) that they could make fun of - so people can't keep a straight face when mentioning the films.  It's too bad in my opinion:  Wax on, wax off;  the crane kick;  jacka--es even love to make fun of the character Mr. Miagi.The first one was a good teen movie.  About a new kid in town, fresh in from Jersey, who develops a crush on a girl - but then the ex-boyfriend and his friends try to ruin the kid's life.  Not only do they ride motorcycles, but they also know karate.Now, I liked part two better than part one.  I think it was the Okanowa setting (I hope I didn't spell that wrong), I really loved it.Part three and four I did not enjoy.  Part three was made to look like more of a sequel to the original - than part two was.  It was a revenge story for the leader of the Cobra Kai (the bad guys in part one), it was very dishonorable, and a disgrace.  I did not enjoy it one bit.  It also made the character of Daniel look like he didn't learn anything in the first two films.After part three's cash-in - it was silly to exploit the films any further, but then came ""The Next Karate Kid"".  Another story of a loner student.  I think part of the story was about nursing pigeons on a rooftop.

It is a beautifully-written, -acted and -directed film that pulls at your heartstrings and makes you cheer.  Pat Morita's Mr Miyagi (for which he received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor) is one the archetypal characters in American film.  His relationship with Ralph Maccio's Daniel LaRusso is as genuine and touching as any you will find in film.

That does not happen very often.The DVD of the entire series is now available (Part 2 is decent but Parts 3 and 4 are not).  The best DVD feature is the making-of documentary.

871651,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B0006OBPTA,William Smith,"[69, 74]","Part I (5 stars): Funny, I'm just not a big ""karate buff"", in fact, this probably is the only set of movies like this I own, or may ever own. When I tell people this is one of my favorite movies *ever*, they laugh. Then they say, ""Are you serious?"" And my words to explain why always fall short. Beyond the karate, beyond the underdog nature, there lie two characters that seem to compliment each other so perfectly it really makes the movie what it is regardless of the subject matter. Something about the chemistry between Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio simply defies convention and thrives on it. The casting by all involved was surely just one part luck, one part fortune, the DVD extras merely icing. My only complaint is this not being mastered to 5.1 DD sound.*edit* I watched the commentary last night and I must say I was disappointed. Pat Morita's input was intrusive, and many comments made by the group were simply uncalled for. When Elizabeth Shue would walk away from the camera they would comment about her rear end and totally ruined a part of my respect for them. They went on to ridicule an ""extra"" who became a greeter of some sort. They laughed and carried on through the whole thing. At the beginning I thought, well they are a lively group, but after 45 minutes it wore thin and I wished then I would have turned it off. There were a few bits here and there I learned, but what I really learned is why companies have the disclaimer at the beginning of the movies.Part II (4 stars): I'm kind of ashamed of avoiding this movie now. As much as I loved the first I never bothered with the second. I've just never been fond of sequels. Be it Back to the Future Two, the Lost World, or the hundred other sub par sequels, they just seem to mar the original product. However, here at Amazon I read that this story picks up 5 minutes after the first and that peaked my interest. Previously, I just assumed it would be directionless swill. So wrong. The score, the heart, the soul, and even the casting practically live up to the first, and I'm shocked at that. In fact Daniels love interest in this even out does the first!! Having the impact on me this film had 19 years after it was made is quite remarkable. It's not without it's flaws though, the last 15-20 minutes really just seemed to lose steam, the ""storm"" sequence being almost painful. Sad that there are no extra's to speak of, this movie may have been even more interesting to hear about.Part III (3 stars): Definitely the weakest of the three, still a must see for the simple fact that Pat and Ralph still have that spark. Sadly, the casting choices for the villains are overwrought and the story just seems forced. I suppose the concept was losing its impact but regardless, the script just wasn't well thought out. Again, this picks up right after Part II and there is just something about this continuity that makes me think John Avildsen has courage and vision. The weakest part of the script easily being the ""sign the paper"" portions that defied common sense, still like Part II I'm simply shocked these movies are not disastrous ""1 out of 5's"" (as some here at Amazon alluded to) although having the original director onboard surely meant these movies had the stability they needed... and deserved. Having viewed Parts II and III has forever altered the way I will view Part I, and I'm relieved to report it's all for the better. They only enhanced what I knew and make me appreciate it that much more. Why not have commentary on all three movies?---The Next Karate Kid (2 stars): I'm trying to view this as a sort of ""bonus movie"" within the packaged set. While 2 stars may seem low I think this movie does contain some decent performances by Hillary and Pat. The problem again is the script, hell, even the premise. So, a middle aged woman lets a friend of her fathers move in with her teenage daughter while she goes and stays at his home California? Please. A big problem are the overzealous sadistic ""TV Movie"" quality of just about everyone except the two leads. Even the love interest in this is so utterly flat it is totally deflated. Most of what should have had an impact (like the Hawk) didn't and a certain parts (like ""Zen"" bowling) seemed like embarrassing filler.",5,Well... the purchase is 5 stars. *edited*,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,4260,"['Part', '5', 'stars', 'Funny', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'big', 'karate', 'buff', 'fact', 'probably', 'only', 'set', 'movies', 'own', 'may', 'ever', 'own', 'When', 'tell', 'people', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', '*ever*', 'laugh', 'Then', 'say', 'Are', 'serious', 'words', 'explain', 'why', 'always', 'fall', 'short', 'karate', 'underdog', 'nature', 'two', 'characters', 'seem', 'compliment', 'other', 'so', 'perfectly', 'really', 'movie', 'what', 'regardless', 'subject', 'matter', 'Something', 'chemistry', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'simply', 'convention', 'thrives', 'casting', 'involved', 'was', 'surely', 'just', 'one', 'part', 'luck', 'one', 'part', 'fortune', 'DVD', 'extras', 'merely', 'icing', 'only', 'complaint', 'not', 'being', 'mastered', '5.1', 'DD', 'sound', '*edit*', 'watched', 'commentary', 'last', 'night', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'input', 'was', 'intrusive', 'many', 'comments', 'made', 'group', 'were', 'simply', 'uncalled', 'When', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'would', 'walk', 'away', 'camera', 'would', 'comment', 'rear', 'end', 'totally', 'ruined', 'part', 'respect', 'went', 'ridicule', 'extra', 'who', 'became', 'greeter', 'sort', 'laughed', 'carried', 'whole', 'thing', 'beginning', 'thought', 'are', 'lively', 'group', '45', 'minutes', 'wore', 'thin', 'wished', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'were', 'few', 'bits', 'here', 'there', 'learned', 'what', 'really', 'learned', 'why', 'companies', 'have', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'movies.Part', 'II', '4', 'stars', ""'m"", 'kind', 'ashamed', 'avoiding', 'movie', 'now', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'first', 'never', 'bothered', 'second', ""'ve"", 'just', 'never', 'been', 'fond', 'sequels', 'Be', 'Back', 'Future', 'Two', 'Lost', 'World', 'hundred', 'other', 'sub', 'par', 'sequels', 'just', 'seem', 'mar', 'original', 'product', 'However', 'here', 'Amazon', 'read', 'story', 'up', '5', 'minutes', 'first', 'peaked', 'interest', 'Previously', 'just', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'directionless', 'swill', 'So', 'wrong', 'score', 'heart', 'soul', 'even', 'casting', 'practically', 'live', 'up', 'first', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'fact', 'Daniels', 'love', 'interest', 'even', 'out', 'first', 'Having', 'impact', 'film', 'had', '19', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'not', 'flaws', 'last', '15-20', 'minutes', 'really', 'just', 'seemed', 'lose', 'steam', 'storm', 'sequence', 'being', 'almost', 'painful', 'Sad', 'are', 'extra', 'speak', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'hear', 'about.Part', 'III', '3', 'stars', 'Definitely', 'weakest', 'three', 'still', 'must', 'see', 'simple', 'fact', 'Pat', 'Ralph', 'still', 'have', 'spark', 'Sadly', 'casting', 'choices', 'villains', 'are', 'overwrought', 'story', 'just', 'forced', 'suppose', 'concept', 'was', 'losing', 'impact', 'regardless', 'script', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'Again', 'up', 'right', 'Part', 'II', 'just', 'something', 'continuity', 'think', 'John', 'Avildsen', 'courage', 'vision', 'weakest', 'part', 'script', 'easily', 'being', 'sign', 'paper', 'portions', 'defied', 'common', 'sense', 'still', 'Part', 'II', ""'m"", 'simply', 'shocked', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'disastrous', '1', '5', 'here', 'Amazon', 'alluded', 'having', 'original', 'director', 'onboard', 'surely', 'meant', 'movies', 'had', 'stability', 'needed', 'deserved', 'Having', 'viewed', 'Parts', 'II', 'III', 'forever', 'altered', 'way', 'will', 'view', 'Part', ""'m"", 'relieved', 'report', 'better', 'only', 'enhanced', 'what', 'knew', 'make', 'appreciate', 'much', 'more', 'Why', 'not', 'have', 'commentary', 'three', 'movies', '-The', 'Next', 'Karate', 'Kid', '2', 'stars', ""'m"", 'trying', 'view', 'sort', 'bonus', 'movie', 'packaged', 'set', '2', 'stars', 'may', 'seem', 'low', 'think', 'movie', 'contain', 'decent', 'performances', 'Hillary', 'Pat', 'problem', 'again', 'script', 'hell', 'even', 'premise', 'So', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'friend', 'fathers', 'move', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'home', 'California', 'Please', 'big', 'problem', 'are', 'overzealous', 'sadistic', 'TV', 'Movie', 'quality', 'just', 'everyone', 'two', 'leads', 'Even', 'love', 'interest', 'so', 'utterly', 'flat', 'totally', 'deflated', 'Most', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'impact', 'Hawk', 'did', ""n't"", 'certain', 'parts', 'Zen', 'bowling', 'seemed', 'embarrassing', 'filler']",The Karate Kid Collection: Four Film Set
871652,A1FT7QFKNHL9DT,B0006OBPTA,Wolfe Moffat,"[2, 2]","When ""Karate Kid"" first showed up in theatres, ""Ghostbusters"" was right there in competition with it! My mom told my buddy and I that we had a choice of one or the other. Well, right away we said, ""Ghostbusters!"" We knew that the other movie was popular, but not this time. Well, a year or two after it was released, I spent the night at another friend's house, and ""Karate Kid"" was highly recommended. When my family moved, and Karate Kid II came to the theatres, we were in line for tickets! I always enjoyed it, and when I heard it was to be a box set, I decided to get the collection. Whether you get this for, ""Wax on, wax off!"", ""Paint the fence."", ""Finish him, Johnny!! Get him a body bag!"", or whether you just enjoy Miyagi, it isn't disappointing. But there are setbacks. All in all, I thought it was indeed a 5 star collection. Here are the movies, with some brief thoughts.The Karate Kid: Well, this is where it all begins! This is where Daniel moves with mother (Ma) from New Jersey to California. This is where a young man finds a mentor in an older maintenance man named Miyagi. This is the beginning of a confrontation between Daniel and a gang called Cobra Kai. This is where Daniel learns the Karate that Miyagi knows to love. The great thing about this is indeed the special features. Lots of cast and crew interviews, from a section dedicated to the music composed by Bill Conti. If this was the first movie you saw Pat Morita in, and you were only ten, were you fooled into thinking that he was a Karate expert, and not simply a comedian?! This is the beginning, and it is a classic!Karate Kid II: I personally thought this was just as good and the original. Miyagi goes to Okinawa for his sick and dying father, and Daniel joins him. As the subtitle states, ""The story continues,"" and Miyagi runs into an old foe, and Daniel confronts a whole new foe in the menacing nephew. Good story, lots of good stuff, great song by Peter Cetera to go along with it, (Glory of Love) and a movie that fans will love for years to come. Not as many special features, but still some good stuff.Karate Kid III: Back from Okinawa, back in the States! Somebody is looking to get even with Daniel and Miyagi. A grudge match between masters is in the making, and Daniel faces a most ruthless opponent!  If you are looking for lots of fights, III definitely dishes them out! By now, the ending is rather obvious. Consider this to be Daniel, with an even bigger attitude. Miyagi's lessons in this are beyond tournaments and trophies, and much more valuable. No real special features in this.The Next Karate Kid: Out with Ralph Macchio, in with Hilary Swank. Yuck! Ok, it wasn't too terrible. But there was nothing classic about it. Nothing I care to remember about this one really. There are some interesting scenes, but they fade away rather quickly. As the credits roll, you simply say, ""Oh well. That's that."" And then you put it away. Not a total loss. No real special features.But hey, this is your collection. You can take it or leave it! It does have everything you could possibly want (or not possibly want) as fare as Karate Kid goes. For the most part, I really enjoy this collection!",5,"EVERYTHING Karate Kid!
