1214253,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B001LIK8DY,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[3, 3]","The campy charm is largely absent in Season 2 of ""The Lair."" The series  loses focus by concentrating more on a dull werewolf named Ian (Maddy Ferraro) who is befriended by the temporarily blinded Sheriff Trout (Colton Ford). There's an even more preposterous subplot involving a botanist who is posessed by a psychotic plant!! Some stiff, wodden performances, especially from Frankie Valenti as the botanist's assistant/boyfriend, make ""The Lair"" low-quality, as well as low-budget.The tension, sexual and otherwise, between Vampires Colin and Damien (Dylan Vox and Peter Stickles) and Damien's beloved mortal soul mate Thom (David Moretti) should have been front and center. Unfortunately, there's not enough of it. Very little of the action takes place in The Lair itself, as the kinky gay vampire's club was closed after the climax of Season 1. There's still some sizzling chemistry between Stickles and Moretti. But a few softcore sex scenes don't make up for the fact that Season 2 of ""The Lair"" lacks serious bite.",2,"""THE LAIR"" SEASON 2 LACKS BITE",1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,1021,"['campy', 'charm', 'largely', 'absent', 'Season', '2', 'Lair', 'series', 'focus', 'concentrating', 'more', 'dull', 'werewolf', 'named', 'Ian', 'Maddy', 'Ferraro', 'who', 'befriended', 'temporarily', 'blinded', 'Sheriff', 'Trout', 'Colton', 'Ford', 'even', 'more', 'preposterous', 'subplot', 'involving', 'botanist', 'who', 'posessed', 'psychotic', 'plant', 'stiff', 'wodden', 'performances', 'especially', 'Frankie', 'Valenti', 'botanist', 'assistant/boyfriend', 'make', 'Lair', 'low-quality', 'as', 'well', 'low-budget.The', 'tension', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'Vampires', 'Colin', 'Damien', 'Dylan', 'Vox', 'Peter', 'Stickles', 'Damien', 'beloved', 'mortal', 'soul', 'mate', 'Thom', 'David', 'Moretti', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'front', 'center', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'enough', 'Very', 'little', 'action', 'place', 'Lair', 'kinky', 'gay', 'vampire', 'club', 'was', 'closed', 'climax', 'Season', '1', 'still', 'sizzling', 'chemistry', 'Stickles', 'Moretti', 'few', 'softcore', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'Season', '2', 'Lair', 'serious', 'bite']",The Lair : Season 2

1214256,ATI6ZI9EVJ5H2,B001LIK8DY,"Pyramus James ""Reserve Looker""","[7, 8]","Season 2 has added new characters with their own twist to the storyline.  Season two picks up a day or so after season one ended.  We find out the fate of Thom, Frankie, Laura and Sheriff. We see the Lair under new leadership of Colin. But many details have changed such as the production quality, acting, and most of all the new theme song.  This season was a major improvement from last season.  There where two storylines yes Thom had to share the sport light this season with Ian, the Werewolf.  It would have been nice to see a cross over episode for with Dante's Cove. I am so excited that they decided to produce a Third Season with 12 episodes.  This will be great. There are many cliff hangers such as... Will Thom and Damian relationship survive? Will Colin come back?  Since the Botanist was bitten by Ian is he now a Werewolf?  Will there be a conflict between the Vampires and the Werewovles?",5,This bite has mature taste!,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,905,"['Season', '2', 'added', 'new', 'characters', 'own', 'twist', 'storyline', 'Season', 'two', 'up', 'day', 'so', 'season', 'one', 'ended', 'find', 'out', 'fate', 'Thom', 'Frankie', 'Laura', 'Sheriff', 'see', 'Lair', 'new', 'leadership', 'Colin', 'many', 'details', 'have', 'changed', 'such', 'production', 'quality', 'acting', 'most', 'new', 'theme', 'song', 'season', 'was', 'major', 'improvement', 'last', 'season', 'where', 'two', 'storylines', 'yes', 'Thom', 'had', 'share', 'sport', 'light', 'season', 'Ian', 'Werewolf', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'cross', 'episode', 'Dante', 'Cove', 'am', 'so', 'excited', 'decided', 'produce', 'Third', 'Season', '12', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'are', 'many', 'cliff', 'hangers', 'such', 'Will', 'Thom', 'Damian', 'relationship', 'survive', 'Will', 'Colin', 'come', 'back', 'Botanist', 'was', 'bitten', 'Ian', 'now', 'Werewolf', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'conflict', 'Vampires', 'Werewovles']",The Lair : Season 2
