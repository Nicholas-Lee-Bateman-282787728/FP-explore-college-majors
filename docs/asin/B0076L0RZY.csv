For me the treatment is unconvincing; I felt the actors were trying to act out something they heard about. The heroine's transition from cult to &#34;middle America&#34; seemed to require nothing more than a change of habit--the deep and often quiet power of a conviction never came through to me. The movie was as thin and moralizing as any Christian film, just with a different moral. Two stars for the subject.",2,Got God?

1526788,ABCXLUUKNZQHI,B0076L0RZY,Diana Mcmanus,"[2, 2]","This movie has a lot more depth than to say it is about spiritual abuse which it isn't.  This movie is about true love which has no religion and can be only expressed through kindness.  The young woman in the film had a troubled childhood and was essentially looking for God to provide her with answers.  She ended up in a cult like church run by a tyrannical minister that used religion for control and domination.  Her courage to get a job outside the church started her journey with a ""free spirited"" young man who showed her true love isn't about religion and God is about love.  I connected with the ""free spirited"" young man who wasn't bound by any religion, but had a philosophy of kindness and love that changed the young woman's life.",5,True Love Isn't About Religion,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,743,"['movie', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'say', 'spiritual', 'abuse', ""n't"", 'movie', 'true', 'love', 'religion', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'expressed', 'kindness', 'young', 'woman', 'film', 'had', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'was', 'essentially', 'looking', 'God', 'provide', 'answers', 'ended', 'up', 'cult', 'church', 'run', 'tyrannical', 'minister', 'used', 'religion', 'control', 'domination', 'courage', 'get', 'job', 'church', 'started', 'journey', 'free', 'spirited', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'showed', 'true', 'love', ""n't"", 'religion', 'God', 'love', 'connected', 'free', 'spirited', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'bound', 'religion', 'had', 'philosophy', 'kindness', 'love', 'changed', 'young', 'woman', 'life']",Paradise Recovered

1526790,A18UEW8XHVOFXJ,B0076L0RZY,TF Fixer,"[23, 25]","This independent film represents a call to awareness of the religious abuse that has become such a common scene on the American religious right landscape.  The film is an exercise in contrasts - contrasts that Esther must experience in order to recover paradise for herself.  Two young men, Gabriel and Philip, are presented to Esther as choices for love.  Philip, the malingering convert, appears to understand the problems with his church, but is willing to play the game for his gain - sexual and financial.  Gabe stands as an agnostic, who really seems to believe in God, who proclaims his disdain for the trappings of organized religion, but who stands upon his beliefs, ambiguous as they are even to him.  But then there are two fathers.  Both just as firm in their belief in organized religion, both are pastors.  Philip's father uses his position to control others.  He does not care for the souls, only for his own power.  Gabe's father gets it.  He believes in God and organized religion.  He stands firm in his own faith and will not apologize for that faith.  But - and this is important - his confidence is so strong that he has no need to coerce, force, abuse others into the fold.  Gabe's father understands the freedom that Christ affords.  His is no legalistic faith and he can be proud of his son for being an agnostic, but living the love of Christ in a real sense.This film is poignant because it brings into focus the problem of the social gospel.  The extreme religious right condemns the many churches for their focuses on doing unto others as we would have others do unto us, calling those of us who believe living Christ's love ""the failure of the social gospel.""  Yet it is the religious right who truly preach the social gospel - that is, they preach America's salvation is in transforming American culture through laws and coercion. This film reminds us that we can be free through Christ.  Though you may watch it and believe it to be an attack on Christianity, it is not.  It is an attack on those who would use Christianity to control others, to exert abuse and call it faith.  It is an attack on those who would use God and the Bible to abuse others.",5,poignant film about religious extremism,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,2182,"['independent', 'film', 'call', 'awareness', 'religious', 'abuse', 'become', 'common', 'scene', 'American', 'religious', 'right', 'landscape', 'film', 'exercise', 'contrasts', 'contrasts', 'Esther', 'must', 'experience', 'order', 'recover', 'paradise', 'Two', 'young', 'men', 'Gabriel', 'Philip', 'are', 'presented', 'Esther', 'choices', 'love', 'Philip', 'malingering', 'convert', 'understand', 'problems', 'church', 'willing', 'play', 'game', 'gain', 'sexual', 'financial', 'Gabe', 'agnostic', 'who', 'really', 'believe', 'God', 'who', 'disdain', 'trappings', 'organized', 'religion', 'who', 'beliefs', 'ambiguous', 'are', 'even', 'then', 'are', 'two', 'fathers', 'just', 'firm', 'belief', 'organized', 'religion', 'are', 'pastors', 'Philip', 'father', 'position', 'control', 'others', 'not', 'care', 'souls', 'only', 'own', 'power', 'Gabe', 'father', 'God', 'organized', 'religion', 'firm', 'own', 'faith', 'will', 'not', 'apologize', 'faith', 'important', 'confidence', 'so', 'strong', 'need', 'coerce', 'force', 'abuse', 'others', 'fold', 'Gabe', 'father', 'freedom', 'Christ', 'affords', 'legalistic', 'faith', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'son', 'being', 'agnostic', 'living', 'love', 'Christ', 'real', 'sense.This', 'film', 'poignant', 'focus', 'problem', 'social', 'gospel', 'extreme', 'religious', 'right', 'condemns', 'many', 'churches', 'focuses', 'doing', 'unto', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'others', 'do', 'unto', 'calling', 'who', 'believe', 'living', 'Christ', 'love', 'failure', 'social', 'gospel', 'religious', 'right', 'who', 'truly', 'preach', 'social', 'gospel', 'preach', 'America', 'salvation', 'transforming', 'American', 'culture', 'laws', 'coercion', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'free', 'Christ', 'may', 'watch', 'believe', 'be', 'attack', 'Christianity', 'not', 'attack', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'Christianity', 'control', 'others', 'exert', 'abuse', 'call', 'faith', 'attack', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'God', 'Bible', 'abuse', 'others']",Paradise Recovered

I stand by my review, however and would not be writing this unless I firmly believed what I am about to write: ""Paradise"" is a beautifully done movie about a young woman's spiritual journey and maturation. If you are like me, that description initially might be squirm inducing. However, the movie is also a warm and tender romance and is often quite funny. This is not your typical indie drama. It is at times a surprising story about spirituality and grace, particularly given the hero of the movie is an atheist who comes to the aid of a Christian going through a crisis of faith. The acting by the two leads is splendid, they are a pleasure to watch, as are many of the supporting performances. The direction is sensitive and spot on. 'Paradise' is a lovely, entertaining movie with some complex ideas thoughtfully and honestly addressed. This is well worth your time.",4,"A funny, warm, insightful drama",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,937,"['be', 'upfront', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'Paradise', 'Recovered', 'stand', 'review', 'however', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'writing', 'firmly', 'believed', 'what', 'am', 'write', 'Paradise', 'beautifully', 'done', 'movie', 'young', 'woman', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'maturation', 'are', 'description', 'initially', 'might', 'be', 'squirm', 'inducing', 'However', 'movie', 'also', 'warm', 'tender', 'romance', 'often', 'quite', 'funny', 'not', 'typical', 'indie', 'drama', 'times', 'surprising', 'story', 'spirituality', 'grace', 'particularly', 'given', 'hero', 'movie', 'atheist', 'who', 'aid', 'Christian', 'going', 'crisis', 'faith', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'splendid', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'are', 'many', 'supporting', 'performances', 'direction', 'sensitive', 'spot', ""'Paradise"", 'lovely', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'complex', 'ideas', 'thoughtfully', 'honestly', 'addressed', 'well', 'time']",Paradise Recovered
