This wasn't a movie where the men were degrading the women or the women shaking their behinds all over the place.It was a movie of black professionals who were finding their way in their professions and personal lives.

941208,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000BDH6IU,Dorrie Wheeler,"[58, 61]","Work place romances. They can really be tricky. Gina Torres (Serenity) stars in Fair Game as a busy executive named Stacey. Her co-worker Michael is in a transitional period but clearly enjoys their tryst. After asking one of her co-workers to stay late at work they find themselves caught up in a moment of passion she dismisses as a ""one time flukish thing."" Their one time flukish thing turns into a multi-time thing. When Mike finds himself needing a place to stay he turns to Stacey who has vowed that their affair is a no strings attached thing. Stacey opens her apartment to Mike and let's him stay for a few days. Mike is stuck sleeping on the couch. He wants more from Stacey than she is willing to give. He goes above and beyond to impress her. When a handsome executive starts spending time with Stacey, Michael is really left to ponder what he should do next about the situation.Fair Game is a very interesting film about a common topic that is not addressed much on the big screen. It's a really great film. Stacey and Michael have a real chemistry, but the prospect of a big promotion and other factors stand in the way of the two of them pursuing a relationship.Fair Game won several awards on the film festival circuit. Although Gina Torres is probably the most well known cast member, Fair Game features stellar acting from Christopher B. Duncan, Kellita Smith, Michael Whaley, Terri Vaughn, Mother Love and comedian Mark Christopher Lawrence.",5,Satisfying African-American Romantic Film,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,1460,"['Work', 'place', 'romances', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'tricky', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'Serenity', 'Fair', 'Game', 'busy', 'executive', 'named', 'Stacey', 'co-worker', 'Michael', 'transitional', 'period', 'clearly', 'tryst', 'asking', 'one', 'co-workers', 'stay', 'late', 'work', 'find', 'caught', 'up', 'moment', 'passion', 'one', 'time', 'flukish', 'thing', 'one', 'time', 'flukish', 'thing', 'multi-time', 'thing', 'When', 'Mike', 'needing', 'place', 'stay', 'Stacey', 'who', 'vowed', 'affair', 'strings', 'attached', 'thing', 'Stacey', 'apartment', 'Mike', 'let', 'stay', 'few', 'days', 'Mike', 'stuck', 'sleeping', 'couch', 'more', 'Stacey', 'willing', 'give', 'impress', 'When', 'handsome', 'executive', 'spending', 'time', 'Stacey', 'Michael', 'really', 'left', 'ponder', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'next', 'situation.Fair', 'Game', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'common', 'topic', 'not', 'addressed', 'much', 'big', 'screen', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'Stacey', 'Michael', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'prospect', 'big', 'promotion', 'other', 'factors', 'stand', 'way', 'two', 'pursuing', 'relationship.Fair', 'Game', 'won', 'several', 'awards', 'film', 'festival', 'circuit', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'probably', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'cast', 'member', 'Fair', 'Game', 'stellar', 'acting', 'Christopher', 'B.', 'Duncan', 'Kellita', 'Smith', 'Michael', 'Whaley', 'Terri', 'Vaughn', 'Mother', 'Love', 'comedian', 'Mark', 'Christopher', 'Lawrence']",Fair Game

Who would have ever believed that the Boss Lady and Michael, employee...Well, I'll have to let you fine out what else happens.It is worth the money and you will smile, laugh, love it all. Tell others to buy this movie and many other Black movies to support our people. If we don't who will.I am building a Black movie library for myself. I love my Black movies because I am tired of looking at White movies. I have them but there needs to be a change in my life. I want to see more of mypeople in good, decent movies that don't have cursing, sex, nudity, bad language, nappy leaving a bad taste in my mouth.There are a lot of Black decent movies out there, and you just have to look for them.  I search everywhere for them, read review and decide to buy.  I also buy black plays that I never got to see or even knew they were out there.So lets keep buy Black movies and plays and support this media that is just beginning to thrive from us, no one else will but us.Also buy Fire & Ice; Breakin' All The Rules; After All; Masquerade; Marrying Up (stage play); A Private Affair (BET).

It shows about office power and romance between a boss who is the female for a change and a male who is the employees. Both of them and all of the people in the office is so stupid and not even close to funny. Bid on it so that you can enjoy a few beers while watching it. It might blow your buzz however. And for me to say that makes it really really bad.
