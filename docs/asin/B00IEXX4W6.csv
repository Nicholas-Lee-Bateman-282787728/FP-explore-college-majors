1694060,A41XDR2AM962G,B00IEXX4W6,DVD reviewer,"[1, 1]","Unrealistic? Sure. But films like ""Dakota's Summer"" are a welcome oasis for children who live in an increasingly complicated world that offers many more chances for heartbreak than heartwarming moments. It's formulaic, it's predictable, and nothing really bad happens to anyone. Yet those darned horses are as therapeutic for viewers as they are for the troubled kids in the film, and the characters are ones we care about. There's a place for light drama and formulaic, feel-good movies, and as that genre goes, ""Cowgirls `n Angels: Dakota's Summer"" is an entertaining film that will definitely appeal to the target audience, and maybe even the entire family--Familyhometheater.com",4,A solid family film with a fascinating rodeo backdrop,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,682,"['Unrealistic', 'Sure', 'films', 'Dakota', 'Summer', 'are', 'welcome', 'oasis', 'children', 'who', 'live', 'increasingly', 'complicated', 'world', 'many', 'more', 'chances', 'heartbreak', 'heartwarming', 'moments', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'really', 'bad', 'happens', 'anyone', 'darned', 'horses', 'are', 'therapeutic', 'viewers', 'are', 'troubled', 'kids', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'ones', 'care', 'place', 'light', 'drama', 'formulaic', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'genre', 'Cowgirls', 'n', 'Angels', 'Dakota', 'Summer', 'entertaining', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'target', 'audience', 'maybe', 'even', 'entire', 'family', 'Familyhometheater.com']",N/A

It was always a wholesome movie, perfect for impressionable young minds to watch. That is exactly what crossed my mind while I was watching this film.Basically it's about a girl who finds life is not what she thought it was. It leads her to rediscover herself and see what things are not really any different than they were before. The same people and family in her life still love her and that's really all that matters.So, it's not a movie that will win Oscar's in my opinion, but you can be sure knowing you and your family are watching a good movie, filled with great moral content and values.",3,Love Horses!,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,681,"['Remember', 'when', 'would', 'come', 'home', 'school', 'watch', ""'After-School"", 'Special', 'was', 'always', 'wholesome', 'movie', 'perfect', 'impressionable', 'young', 'minds', 'watch', 'exactly', 'what', 'crossed', 'mind', 'was', 'watching', 'girl', 'who', 'life', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'rediscover', 'see', 'what', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'different', 'were', 'before', 'same', 'people', 'family', 'life', 'still', 'love', 'really', 'matters.So', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'win', 'Oscar', 'opinion', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'knowing', 'family', 'are', 'watching', 'good', 'movie', 'filled', 'great', 'moral', 'content', 'values']",N/A

First, I want to mention that I haven't seen the first movie in this series, but I was still able to follow along with no issues. This movie definitely stands of it's own. Dakota learns she's adopted and it sends her world into a downward spiral. She throws herself into her horses and winning the competitions. She tries to forget about everything else, but the past has a way of sneaking up on you no matter how much you try to avoid it.With the help of the people who love her, Dakota learns that real family doesn't really have anything to do with your blood.  This beautiful coming of age story is well written and perfectly cast. The beautiful horses are a great addition to a heart warming tale.
