693113,A2YC5Y2ABK0MJZ,B0000633UA,"Allen W. Wright ""Webmaster, 'rogue scholar""","[1, 3]","I wonder if the series producer John Semper reads these reviews. If so, he might remember me from GEnie, where I was a well-intentioned, fairly good-natured critic of the series. What I remember from those long-ago days is that his heart always seemed to be in the right place.And there are some good things about the series. Spidey is basically Spidey. The soap opera elements are important to the character. The voice acting of Spidey and Jameson (Ed Asner!) is good.But the whole thing seems a bit laboured -- a bit mechanical. Much like the somewhat jerky animation which jumps between computer and traditional-looking far too often. Also, Spidey's always has been a chatterbox, but it seemed to me that he talks just a bit too much to work outside of the comics page. (Mind you, I'd like to see the movie Spidey be a bit more chatty.)As for the individual episodes, I don't think they are the best of the series. But we do get to see a lot of classic bad guys -- always a good thing. Two episodes are somewhat based on the classic ""The Kid Who Collected Spider-Man"" story. That basic, warm story is not improved when the whole Doc Ock, Octobot, amnesia plot is graphed onto it. A half hour of Spider-Man visiting the girl in the hospital would have been more enjoyable, and the Doc Ock stuff dilutes that.There's also The Origin of Spiderman (sic) episode from the 1960s series. Ah, now talk about limited animation. And stock footage. But I love those funky Ralph Baskhi-directed backgrounds. And it's a pretty good adaptation of the comic origin. And hey, I loved it as a kid. Nostalgia produces a kind of blindness.The special features were pretty good. The gallery of villains was a nice round-up. I was particularly amused by Stan Lee comments on the bad guys who he didn't co-create and didn't really know.Oh, and I'm really glad that Carnage and Venom weren't the bad guys on this DVD. Young whippersnapper upstarts!Next year, I could see a special crossover DVD featuring the Daredevil and X-Men episodes to promote their new movies.Allen",3,"Well, more like 2 and half stars.",1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,2051,"['wonder', 'series', 'producer', 'John', 'Semper', 'reviews', 'so', 'might', 'remember', 'GEnie', 'where', 'was', 'well-intentioned', 'fairly', 'good-natured', 'critic', 'series', 'What', 'remember', 'long-ago', 'days', 'heart', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'right', 'place.And', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'series', 'Spidey', 'basically', 'Spidey', 'soap', 'opera', 'elements', 'are', 'important', 'character', 'voice', 'acting', 'Spidey', 'Jameson', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'good.But', 'whole', 'thing', 'bit', 'laboured', 'bit', 'mechanical', 'Much', 'somewhat', 'jerky', 'animation', 'computer', 'traditional-looking', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'Also', 'Spidey', 'always', 'been', 'chatterbox', 'seemed', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'comics', 'page', 'Mind', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'movie', 'Spidey', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'chatty', 'individual', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'classic', 'bad', 'guys', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'Two', 'episodes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'based', 'classic', 'Kid', 'Who', 'Collected', 'Spider-Man', 'story', 'basic', 'warm', 'story', 'not', 'improved', 'when', 'whole', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Octobot', 'amnesia', 'plot', 'graphed', 'half', 'hour', 'Spider-Man', 'visiting', 'girl', 'hospital', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'stuff', 'also', 'Origin', 'Spiderman', 'sic', 'episode', '1960s', 'series', 'Ah', 'now', 'talk', 'limited', 'animation', 'stock', 'footage', 'love', 'funky', 'Ralph', 'Baskhi-directed', 'backgrounds', 'pretty', 'good', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'origin', 'hey', 'loved', 'kid', 'Nostalgia', 'kind', 'blindness.The', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'gallery', 'villains', 'was', 'nice', 'round-up', 'was', 'particularly', 'amused', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'comments', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'co-create', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know.Oh', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'Carnage', 'Venom', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guys', 'DVD', 'Young', 'upstarts', 'Next', 'year', 'could', 'see', 'special', 'crossover', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'Daredevil', 'X-Men', 'episodes', 'promote', 'new', 'movies.Allen']",N/A
693114,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,B0000633UA,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","When I bought The Spiderman Collection, it cost $40.49 online and $44.99 in Barnes & Noble. I bought the DVD package and the first DVD I saw was Spiderman The Ultimate Villain Showdown. ""Make a Wish"" and ""Attack of the Octobot"" were part of The Sins of the Fathers II and III. These two episodes were so touching that they have stayed with me throughout the years. I first saw this DVD (And The Two Others In The Package) in 2007, and I have recently viewed them again. They are a tremendous posession to have and I truly enjoy them as will any other Spiderman fan. What's great about the series is that it appeals to adults as well as kids. Each plot has elements that adults can relate to in their own way. Too, it educates kids as to the goings on (Subtly) in the world. The Sins of the Fathers V: ""Rocket Racer"" really brings this to mind. Kids who have come up hard in single parent homes and have to deal with the day to day struggles between making right and wrong decisions in their lives can attest to this. I can't leave out The Sins of the Fathers IV: ""Enter the Green Goblin,"" for good measure. This part too more than held my interest.I so wish the entire series would be released in America. But for now I will have to hold on and enjoy what I have. The DVDs have Stan Lee giving his commentaries and you also have a couple of Spiderman episodes from 1967. Yes they are dated, but still hold their own and are a fun view as it shows us what the 1960s used to look like. I was not alive at the time so it is a kind of time warp seeing the older style animation.There is also a supervillain showcase on one of the DVD tracks at the end. You will like it as it gives a bio on many of the major tough guys Spiderman has faced throughout the years. Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed!A.

They are paced so quickly that my head spun when watching it.  The stories are not so bad but they try to squeeze so much into them that it is pure sensory overload.  Slow it down guys and tell the story with confidence, not speed.This contrast is most evident when viewing the original Spidey cartoon from the 1960's, which, while technically inferior in animation, had so much more character, a better theme song, interesting angles and perspectives and those great deep ink colors reminiscent of a real comic book.

693119,AOYQR2530QCDX,B0000633UA,ffootballguru27,"[2, 8]","This video includes 5 Spider Man adventures. One of them is form the sixties and 4 from the the 90's.As I grew up I was a fan of Super Man and Spider Man comic books, but I never really got into them, but when I heard this movie was coming out I knew I had to see it. This movie portrays the great works of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who made Spider-Man into an ever-popular comic book while making Marvel Comics famous. My favorite adventure on this movie is ""The origin of Spider-Man"" which this year's Spider man movie is based on.A bite by a rare breed of spiders at the Columbia University science lab gives Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) great vision and a perfect body. He also is also given great agility to jump form large skyscrapers and spin webs from his wrist. Then he assumes the identity of Spider Man to fight off the evil Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), that terrorizes the city with a glider that drops several bombs at a time. Spider-Man nearly loses his life while saving the life of his girlfriend, people who are being threatened to be killed by the Green Goblin, and many innocent people who he doesn't even know.""The origin of Spider-Man"":Tobey Maguire, with the emotional lead role overcomes the tragic death of his beloved Uncle Ben, growth trauma's, doubts, sorrows, and fear, to save lives and become the city icon. Willem Dafoe's hystericals and split-personality suffered after a lab-experiment gone wrong make him be a friend one minute and the evil Green Goblin the next. Kirsten Dunst fits the role nicely as Peter's love Mary Jane. Even characters with smaller parts like Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), and his friend Harry (James Franco) are amazing. Sam Raimi's big-screen version of the Marvel Comic's good-vs-evil Spider-Man comics is portrayed by outstanding acting, eye-popping special effects, great sound and much more.

693120,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B0000633UA,Frederick Baptist,"[6, 7]","As this DVD is directed at what Disney aka BVHE feels is its target audience i.e. kids under 14 and above 3, I cannot fathom the negative responses from adults who lament that just because we don't have full season releases that this DVD therefore sucks.  I think the phrase ""grow up"" comes to mind; although the cartoons here may appeal to a larger, older audience, these are after all cartoons and are aimed at the target audience mentioned earlier.  Box sets are clearly out of the financial reach of these young-ins and so for their sake, thankfully we have relatively inexpensive offerings like this one.Given this, this is actually a very good DVD as it has very strong bonus extras which would appeal to any young fan.  The 1967 classic: ""The Origins of Spider-Man"" although severely dated and poorly preserved is a great collectors' item and allows the young viewer a peak into what animated television was like in the late 60s.  Although, the enjoyment level is limited by the old technology, the educational level ranks as very high.We also get great introductions to each episode by none other than the genius, Stan Lee, himself, the creator of most of the characters showcased on this disc.  This in itself is a collectors' item as given his advanced age, it's doubtful fans will be treated to many more candid conversations/interviews with Mr. Marvel himself.  ""Stan Lee's Soapbox"" is a brilliant interview in which the man covers many aspects of the character he created and more importantly, his own world view giving us a glimpse of what makes the man tick, what motivates him etc.We also get a fun extra for younger viewers in the treasure hunt-like feature of ""Rogues' Dossiers"" where the viewer gets to play ""hide-and-seek"" as it were to learn more about Spidey's arch-nemeses.  The only hangup I have with this is that they only stopped at 12 villains which means the great Lizard does not feature among other great villains that Spidey has had to face over the years.The 4 episodes themselves have also been very well chosen:""Make a Wish"" is the modern version of the 1967 classic which re-tells Spidey's origins in flashback form as he relates the story to a young girl at the age of the average target viewer.""Attack of the Octobot"" features Doc Ock and allows for further association of said target viewer by allowing the young girl to assist Spidey on defeating his foe.""Enter the Green Goblin"" is the best episode here and showcases probably the best villain Spidey has ever faced.""Rocket Racer"" again allows for association with the viewer but this time in the older age group of said target audience who also plays a significant part in Spidey's adventure.Overall, this is a great DVD to have for young Spidey fans and Stan Lee's preaching is very evident here in both obvious and subtle/subliminal forms although never in nauseating excess.Kids are unlikely to finish watching this DVD without at least remembering the adage: ""With great power comes great responsibility""  In conclusion and to quote another gem from Stan the Man, ""Excelsior!""",5,Great DVD To Own if You Don't Want To Get the Entire Series!,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,3072,"['DVD', 'directed', 'what', 'Disney', 'aka', 'BVHE', 'target', 'audience', 'i.e', 'kids', '14', 'above', '3', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'negative', 'responses', 'adults', 'who', 'lament', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'full', 'season', 'DVD', 'therefore', 'sucks', 'think', 'phrase', 'grow', 'up', 'mind', 'cartoons', 'here', 'may', 'appeal', 'larger', 'older', 'audience', 'are', 'cartoons', 'are', 'aimed', 'target', 'audience', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Box', 'sets', 'are', 'clearly', 'financial', 'reach', 'young-ins', 'so', 'sake', 'thankfully', 'have', 'relatively', 'inexpensive', 'offerings', 'one.Given', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'very', 'strong', 'bonus', 'extras', 'would', 'appeal', 'young', 'fan', '1967', 'classic', 'Origins', 'Spider-Man', 'severely', 'dated', 'poorly', 'preserved', 'great', 'collectors', 'item', 'young', 'viewer', 'peak', 'what', 'animated', 'television', 'was', 'late', '60s', 'enjoyment', 'level', 'limited', 'old', 'technology', 'educational', 'level', 'ranks', 'very', 'high.We', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'introductions', 'episode', 'none', 'other', 'genius', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'creator', 'most', 'characters', 'showcased', 'disc', 'collectors', 'item', 'given', 'advanced', 'age', 'doubtful', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'many', 'more', 'candid', 'conversations/interviews', 'Mr.', 'Marvel', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Soapbox', 'brilliant', 'interview', 'man', 'many', 'aspects', 'character', 'created', 'more', 'importantly', 'own', 'world', 'view', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'what', 'man', 'tick', 'what', 'etc.We', 'also', 'get', 'fun', 'extra', 'younger', 'viewers', 'treasure', 'hunt-like', 'feature', 'Rogues', 'Dossiers', 'where', 'viewer', 'play', 'hide-and-seek', 'were', 'learn', 'more', 'Spidey', 'arch-nemeses', 'only', 'hangup', 'have', 'only', 'stopped', '12', 'villains', 'great', 'Lizard', 'not', 'feature', 'other', 'great', 'villains', 'Spidey', 'had', 'face', 'years.The', '4', 'episodes', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'Make', 'Wish', 'modern', 'version', '1967', 'classic', 'Spidey', 'origins', 'flashback', 'form', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'age', 'average', 'target', 'viewer', 'Attack', 'Octobot', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'further', 'association', 'said', 'target', 'viewer', 'allowing', 'young', 'girl', 'assist', 'Spidey', 'defeating', 'foe', 'Enter', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'best', 'episode', 'here', 'probably', 'best', 'villain', 'Spidey', 'ever', 'faced', 'Rocket', 'Racer', 'again', 'association', 'viewer', 'time', 'older', 'age', 'group', 'said', 'target', 'audience', 'who', 'also', 'significant', 'part', 'Spidey', 'adventure.Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'have', 'young', 'Spidey', 'fans', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'preaching', 'very', 'evident', 'here', 'obvious', 'subtle/subliminal', 'forms', 'never', 'nauseating', 'excess.Kids', 'are', 'unlikely', 'finish', 'watching', 'DVD', 'least', 'remembering', 'adage', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'conclusion', 'quote', 'gem', 'Stan', 'Man', 'Excelsior']",N/A

The quality is not too bad (not great either), but it does have a few neat features.Aside from the main story and that very-dated first episode of 1967, you'll also get bonus material of a select villain 'bios' (each with an accompanying interview with Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee).

Given the story arc narrative, it could be a little confusing for people to start with episodes 2-5 of season 3.  But anyways I'm a die-hard fan of this show, so what do we get?The synopsizes come from Wikipedia.29.  Make a Wish: In a battle with Dr. Octopus a medical research building is destroyed. Blaming himself, Peter is considering giving up being Spider-Man, when he meets a mystic figure named Madame Web, and his biggest fan, a little girl called Taina. Spider-Man shares his origin with her. Dr. Octopus attacks with his new invention the Octobot.  A pretty good episode, to be honest a good introduction/re-introduction to the series, or rather it would be, if it weren't for the fact it's a 2-parter & part 2 sucks.  B+30. Attack of the Octobot:  Spider-Man thinks that he is evil and unwillingly tries to help Doctor Octopus.  One of the worst continuations of a good episode ever.  The ending is good, but that's all this episode gives us.  D+31. Enter The Green Goblin:  While developing a new gas for the Kingpin to use as a weapon, a mistake triggers an explosion and Norman Osborn disappears in the chaos. A new villain, the Green Goblin appears and kidnaps all of Osborn's enemies.  The best episode on this DVD.  I had the first Hobgoblin episode on a VHS tape (I'll be reviewing it soon) so I was glad to see a follow-up to it.  I actually think using the Hobgoblin first instead of the Green Goblin worked out better.  A+32. Rocket Racer:  Spider-Man finds himself in competition with himself over Felicia. Meanwhile, Jackson Weele leads a gang of thieves armed with jet-pack technology. Weele has developed a large gyro-wheel in which he uses to plunge through the city. Robert Farrell tries to help his ailing mother by using science and the gang's technology to arm himself as the ""Rocket Racer"".  The worst episode on the DVD.  It starts off nice, but almost immediately starts to suck.  Rocket Racer & especially Big Wheel are such lame characters.  Seriously, who picked Big Wheel over Beetle?  DI paid about $3 dollars for it, & since I used to gladly pay $10 for 2 episodes of Transformers on VHS, I'll give it 3 stars as it has 2 good episodes.  But come on Disney, release season sets!

With the big box-office take of Spider-Man (2002), it was inevitable that they'd compile some episodes on DVD as a quick cash-in. The fact that Buena-Vista didn't attempt to explain just what an ""ultimate villain showdown"" included made everyone even more skeptical.Fortunately, Buena-Vista has done an excellent job with this DVD, at least with respects to the presentation. Menus are colorful, with animated transitions and the theme music from the 90's series. There are also a lot of extras that feature new interviews by Stan Lee himself. While I don't know how much of this information is new to die-hard Spider-Man fans, it's always nice hearing the original creator do a retrospective, and I'm glad Buena Vista took the time to consult with him.However, the main feature of the DVD, the 4 episodes from the 90's series, are below par. Now I actually enjoyed the 90's version, theme song, story arcs, and all. Upon repeated viewing, it *does* become painfully obvious that chunks of the animation were recycled or badly animated, but overall the series seemed to capture the essense of Spider-Man's history like the Batman animated series did. To Buena-Vista's credit, the four episodes are in order, even if they are from the middle of the series. But WHY, oh WHY did they have to be these four episodes?? I can understand the Green Goblin episode, as it ties into the movie, and another episode deals with Spider-Man's origin. But the second part of the Dr. Octopus story is embarassing (tired plot of little child who nobody believes in saving superhero) and the last story piles on the morals in a disgustingly thick way without even offering a cool villain! What happened to all those wonderful villains listed in the extras section of the DVD? Also included is the pilot episode of the old Spider-Man series. I never watched enough of these old episodes to become a fan, but it was enjoyable, especially with the classic theme song. My only complaint is the time spent web-slinging, which seems to go on forever.If you like Spider-Man, it's worth picking up. However, most of the main feature isn't very exciting, so although there are good extras included, I can't give this disc another star.

Part Two gives the origins of Spider Man while Part Four illustrates the rise of the Green Goblin.The final part of the tape includes the 1967 cartoon ""The Origins of Spider-Man"". The animation is really bad (after all it was 1967), but is worth watching just to hear that great theme song a couple of times.A decent animated collection that works well as an introduction to who Spider Man is.",4,A Brief Introduction to Spider Man.,1019952000,"04 28, 2002",2002,569,"['video', 'four', 'cartoons', '1990', 'Spider', 'Man', 'series', 'aired', 'Fox', 'Kids', 'network', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'parts', '2-5', 'Sins', 'Fathers', 'story', 'arc', 'Part', 'Two', 'origins', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Part', 'Four', 'rise', 'Green', 'Goblin.The', 'final', 'part', 'tape', '1967', 'cartoon', 'Origins', 'Spider-Man', 'animation', 'really', 'bad', 'was', '1967', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'hear', 'great', 'theme', 'song', 'couple', 'times.A', 'decent', 'animated', 'collection', 'well', 'introduction', 'who', 'Spider', 'Man']",N/A

And he also gets excited whenever he sees The Batman. I stumbled across this when I was looking for something  a little more mature than his regular Sesame Street type videos (which he still loves, but this gives him a variety). While it has Spiderman's origin story told again (to a little girl who is Webhead's greatest fan) and some 'only in New York' scenarios such as the female jamaican cabby who comes to the aid of the Webhead, the grand kid still is a bit frightened at the Green Goblin. He calls the Goblin ""Monster"" and edges near his paw-paw for protection. Overall, the web swinging and the sticking on the walls alone are enough to keep him into it. This may be a better show for him when he gets older...but hey! For all other Spiderman fans, this is a great video of the 80's series that adequately touch all the bases. Additionally Stan the Man Lee shows up in the extras. That's gotta be Webhead gold..",4,Look out!
