At times, we were shown the older ones on film. This tape is a brief synopsis of many of the specials, starting out with a title image and then showing a few minutes of the original.This is nature programming at its most raw and best. In general, the specials are not for children, the one depicting lions shows them taking down, killing and consuming their prey. However, they are as educational as film can ever be because after a certain age, nature should not be sugar-coated. It must be presented in the natural form, complete with the birth, growls, snarls and the blood of a violent death.",5,"Nature as it should be presented, in the natural form right up to the bloody death of food",1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,713,"['When', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'watching', 'National', 'Geographic', 'specials', 'television', 'was', 'requirement', 'science', 'classes', 'times', 'were', 'shown', 'older', 'ones', 'film', 'tape', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'many', 'specials', 'starting', 'out', 'title', 'image', 'then', 'showing', 'few', 'minutes', 'original.This', 'nature', 'programming', 'most', 'raw', 'best', 'general', 'specials', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'one', 'depicting', 'lions', 'taking', 'down', 'killing', 'consuming', 'prey', 'However', 'are', 'as', 'educational', 'film', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'because', 'certain', 'age', 'nature', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'sugar-coated', 'must', 'be', 'presented', 'natural', 'form', 'complete', 'birth', 'growls', 'snarls', 'blood', 'violent', 'death']",N/A
