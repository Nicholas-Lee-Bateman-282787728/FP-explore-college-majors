1047666,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000MMN6YS,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 8]","Mesmermerizing, often perplexing, and surreal, 'Pefume: The Story of a Murderer' is more than a keen study in the sense of smell.  It methodically wraps a story around key players that both transcend and embrace class and sensual experience.  What strikes me throughout this film is how different it is from other movie outings.We start with a French baby who is born in Paris in the greatest of squalor.  His mother abandons him and lives him to rot on the streets.  She is caught and sent to the gallows, but his fate is to be sent to an orphanage where the children almost make a second attempt at the death penalty.  He's Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), and he soon discovers coming of age that he is different.  Not only is he a pariah, but he harbors a strong sense of smell that is only associated with animals.  It becomes clear that not only does it become his main sensory operandi to detect things and people, but, it is his last piece of dignity, so he lives his whole life wanting to preserve every smell he comes across on the planet.  Director Tom Tykwer makes every image stand out, so we can see, hear, and, well, almost smell, everything Jean-Baptiste does.  I felt my mind's filing cabinet filling in the blanks.  What they don't provide, we easily fill in the gaps, but what they do provide is an especially sensual visual and listening experience.  Much of 'Perfume...' is exquisite.  So if it is smell, like himself, he wishes to preserve, his highest pursuit will be for ""the scent of a woman"".  He can't rise above that in 18th century France until he comes upon a famed Italian perfumer living in Paris, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman).  Delivering hides from a tannery not known for health benefits, Jean-Baptiste begs Baldini for a chance to work for him.  Here he can work on extra-curricular projects that will attempt to satisfy his olfactory palette for preserving every scent.  It's a tempestuous relationship at times, but it is Jean's portal to encountering wealthy women who wear the scents, like the one's Guiseppe is perveyor for.  In a tragic scene Jean-Baptiste encounters a woman, and, frightening her, he restrains her, so she won't cry out.  He is overly zealous and kills her inadvertently.After that the lingering fragrance of the movie is to trace and bottle the scent of a woman.  There's a scene where a red-haired woman is cutting apricots in two.  It is hallmark.  I was expecting an overflow of sexuality, but what I got was sensuality that was effective like few films are.  The rest of the movie takes many turns; many of which I didn't expect.  I am still pondering the repurcussions of this film.  The only film I can think of that remotely reminds me of 'Perfume' is 'Chocolat'.  It is an odd and unique bird.  While I am satisfied with the lingering effects of 'Perfume,' it isn't all neat and tidy.  Perhaps that's what makes it so rare and special...The film I mean.",5,"An 'Obsession' ""To Die For""",1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,2934,"['Mesmermerizing', 'often', 'perplexing', 'surreal', 'Story', 'Murderer', 'more', 'keen', 'study', 'sense', 'smell', 'methodically', 'story', 'key', 'players', 'transcend', 'embrace', 'class', 'sensual', 'experience', 'What', 'film', 'how', 'different', 'other', 'movie', 'start', 'French', 'baby', 'who', 'born', 'Paris', 'greatest', 'squalor', 'mother', 'abandons', 'rot', 'streets', 'caught', 'sent', 'gallows', 'fate', 'be', 'sent', 'orphanage', 'where', 'children', 'almost', 'make', 'second', 'attempt', 'death', 'penalty', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Grenouille', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'soon', 'coming', 'age', 'different', 'Not', 'only', 'pariah', 'strong', 'sense', 'smell', 'only', 'associated', 'animals', 'clear', 'not', 'only', 'become', 'main', 'sensory', 'operandi', 'detect', 'things', 'people', 'last', 'piece', 'dignity', 'whole', 'life', 'wanting', 'preserve', 'smell', 'planet', 'Director', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'image', 'stand', 'out', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'well', 'almost', 'smell', 'everything', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'felt', 'mind', 'filing', 'cabinet', 'filling', 'blanks', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'provide', 'easily', 'fill', 'gaps', 'what', 'do', 'provide', 'especially', 'sensual', 'visual', 'listening', 'experience', 'Much', 'exquisite', 'So', 'smell', 'preserve', 'highest', 'pursuit', 'will', 'be', 'scent', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rise', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'famed', 'Italian', 'perfumer', 'living', 'Paris', 'Guiseppe', 'Baldini', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Delivering', 'hides', 'tannery', 'not', 'known', 'health', 'benefits', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Baldini', 'chance', 'work', 'Here', 'can', 'work', 'extra-curricular', 'projects', 'will', 'attempt', 'satisfy', 'olfactory', 'palette', 'preserving', 'scent', 'tempestuous', 'relationship', 'times', 'Jean', 'portal', 'encountering', 'wealthy', 'women', 'who', 'wear', 'scents', 'one', 'Guiseppe', 'perveyor', 'tragic', 'scene', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'woman', 'frightening', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cry', 'out', 'overly', 'zealous', 'inadvertently.After', 'lingering', 'fragrance', 'movie', 'trace', 'bottle', 'scent', 'woman', 'scene', 'where', 'red-haired', 'woman', 'cutting', 'apricots', 'two', 'hallmark', 'was', 'expecting', 'overflow', 'sexuality', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'sensuality', 'was', 'effective', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'rest', 'movie', 'many', 'turns', 'many', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'am', 'still', 'pondering', 'repurcussions', 'film', 'only', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'remotely', ""'Perfume"", ""'Chocolat"", 'odd', 'unique', 'bird', 'am', 'satisfied', 'lingering', 'effects', ""'Perfume"", ""n't"", 'neat', 'tidy', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'so', 'rare', 'special', 'film', 'mean']",N/A

He travels through life with a strange sense of detachement, mentally handicapped in the sense that he knows neither love nor how to receive it.  Instead, he focuses his attention on the one thing that was ever present in his life, his gift, or perhaps curse, his extraordinary sense of smell.He uses it to pursue his goal to keep smell, so that such exquisite scent will never disappear again, from his experience with a beautiful redhead that sold plums on the streets.I can hardly explain how amazingly done this movie is.  The camera shots are gorgeous, when he smelled flowers, you smelled flowers, and are overwhelmed by them on the screen along with dazzling music.Some of the scenes can be a little strange, with a great deal of nudity.  I know this is more generally accepted in European countries, but most people in the US were turned off by some of the scenes, particularly one at the end, that contains, no less than 5000 nude men and women fondling one another.  Very odd.  But at the same time, it suits the fairy tale like story, and is easily undertood to be the consequences of when one human being is as gifted as our main character, with the ability to create something no one else has ever done before.I really hope this movie gets the attention and credit it deserves.

1047672,A3UKQ50DCOIJ01,B000MMN6YS,Barbara J. Guetti,"[0, 0]","This film is another of many directed by Tom Tykwer, a particularly inventive German director who works frequently with American actors.  There's also a book,which I haven't read. Ben Whishaw is a very talented actor, who has appeared in a great many different roles, including Ariel in Shakespeare's The Tempest, with Helen Mirren as Prospera; Bright Star, directed by Jane Campion, about  John Keats, the great British Romantic poet who died very young and his girlfriend, Fanny Brawne; and done a superb job in each of these very different roles, Whishaw also appears in Tykwer's Cloud Atlas, as a musician.In Perfume, Whishaw plays a man raised in utter poverty in 18th Century Paris after his mother gives birth to him in the Paris market and tries to throw him away in the garbage. He is called Grenouille (Frog) from birth. He survives relentlessly because something is driving him to persist in spite of neglect, abuse and savage attacks in the worst slums of Paris.  He is driven by a love of smells: he makes no distinction between good and bad smells, just any smell fascinates him.  Finally he accidentally bumps into The Smell he's been searching for when he makes a delivery to a formerly famous Paris Perfumer (Dustin Hoffman) who is down on his luck, and Hoffman realizes thiat this grubby, inarticulate person is a genius who will save Hoffman's declining business.What Hoffman's character doesn't realize is that Grenouille wants to distill young women into perfume. It's not clear just how this might be done in real life; all we know is that Grenouille stalks them, kills them, and hangs them up in a huge tub of  some liquid element until out of each body a small vial of perfume emerges.  He moves to the town of Grasse, where the French perfumers thrive: the town has become rich from their success.  There he proceeds to capture his victims and make them into different bottled scents.  Finally his evil doings are discovered and he is sentenced to a public execution (decapitation) in front of an immense crowd of angry Perfumers in the city.  I can't reveal just how he rescues himself from this situation, which is too bad because it's one of the best moments in any movie I've seen . . . the entire town suddenly adores him when he waves a handkerchief doused with his girl-distilled perfume at them.This book is based on a novel I haven't read.Barbara Guetti",5,Ben Whishaw and Tom Tykwer are a stellar team,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2387,"['film', 'many', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'particularly', 'inventive', 'German', 'director', 'who', 'frequently', 'American', 'actors', 'also', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'appeared', 'great', 'many', 'different', 'roles', 'including', 'Ariel', 'Shakespeare', 'Tempest', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Prospera', 'Bright', 'Star', 'directed', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'John', 'Keats', 'great', 'British', 'Romantic', 'poet', 'who', 'died', 'very', 'young', 'girlfriend', 'Fanny', 'Brawne', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'very', 'different', 'roles', 'Whishaw', 'also', 'Tykwer', 'Cloud', 'Atlas', 'musician.In', 'Perfume', 'Whishaw', 'man', 'raised', 'utter', 'poverty', '18th', 'Century', 'Paris', 'mother', 'birth', 'Paris', 'market', 'tries', 'throw', 'away', 'garbage', 'called', 'Grenouille', 'Frog', 'birth', 'relentlessly', 'something', 'driving', 'persist', 'spite', 'neglect', 'abuse', 'savage', 'attacks', 'worst', 'slums', 'Paris', 'driven', 'love', 'smells', 'distinction', 'good', 'bad', 'smells', 'just', 'smell', 'Finally', 'accidentally', 'Smell', 'been', 'searching', 'when', 'delivery', 'formerly', 'famous', 'Paris', 'Perfumer', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'down', 'luck', 'Hoffman', 'thiat', 'grubby', 'inarticulate', 'person', 'genius', 'who', 'will', 'save', 'Hoffman', 'declining', 'Hoffman', 'character', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Grenouille', 'distill', 'young', 'women', 'perfume', 'not', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'done', 'real', 'life', 'know', 'Grenouille', 'stalks', 'hangs', 'up', 'huge', 'tub', 'liquid', 'element', 'body', 'small', 'vial', 'perfume', 'emerges', 'town', 'Grasse', 'where', 'French', 'perfumers', 'thrive', 'town', 'become', 'rich', 'success', 'capture', 'victims', 'make', 'different', 'bottled', 'scents', 'Finally', 'evil', 'doings', 'are', 'discovered', 'sentenced', 'public', 'execution', 'decapitation', 'front', 'immense', 'crowd', 'angry', 'Perfumers', 'city', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'just', 'how', 'situation', 'too', 'bad', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'town', 'suddenly', 'when', 'handkerchief', 'doused', 'girl-distilled', 'perfume', 'them.This', 'book', 'based', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read.Barbara', 'Guetti']",N/A

Later on he is sold as a slave, and leads a horrible existance- Until he meets a perfumer who teaches him the art and skills in making perfumes.The most important thing in life to him is that he learn how to preserve smell.The smell he is so fascinated in preserving, is the scent of women.Once he learns that you cannot distell a living thing, he travels to Grasse, the leading perfume maker to learn another art in preserving scent.Along the way he begins murdering women, which leads to his capture, and an AMAZING ending.(This film is also VERY educational as it shows how perfumes are distelled and become oil, and also, all the chords of a perfume ie: heart chord, head chord and the base etc. the basic ingredients etc.)Even though there are unpleasant parts in this movie, it has the charm of a fable,The same BEAUTIFUL cinematography as ""The Illusionist"" did, and the characters were SO well cast.The main character especially.His very soul shows in his eyes.honestly.

I particularly loved Ben Whishaw, who played the bizarre lead character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Grenouille meaning ""frog"" in French), with a gangly, splay-footed, frog-like gait, gargantuan amphibious eyes, and a remarkable ability to convey his feelings (or lack of them) through those eyes.  Grenouille' sinister sence of smell allows him to catch up with even the finest, most exquisitely beautitful young lady in the province of Grasse, to complete his perfume.And then, at the two-hour mark things, get very VERY silly; almost Monty-Python silly.  At the moment when Grenouille is sure to hang for his crimes, he applies a bit of his finished perfume; not only is everyone immediately certain that a man who smells like that must be innocent of all crime, but every ONE of the hundreds of peasants standing around waiting for a good crucifixion/hanging is suddenly compelled to a) strip off all clothes and b) attack the nearest naked body regardless of age gender or whatever.I have to say this is the first time in many decades of filmgoing I have seen an audience laugh OUT LOUD at a scene meant to be moving and dramatic.  It did not offend me, but it made the end of the movie goofy and laughable.I assume that the director was going for moving and horrific, but he got goofy and laughable instead.

1047679,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000MMN6YS,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[3, 4]","The film, ""Perfume"", directed and cowriten by German director, Tom Tykwer, is based on a novel I read shortly after it was published in 1985. I recall then thinking that is was an odd story, which seemed to have few cinematic virtues. This movie tends to confirm my point.The first thing which strikes me is that the dialogue is thin as a weak broth, made from old bones. I find myself in disagreement with several professional critics when I say that the most enjoyable scenes in the film are those with Dustin Hoffman as the old Parisian perfumer, Baldini. Those scenes have at least some reasonable amount of exposition by a character rather than the clinical voice of John Hurt who does the narration, an unseen voice. Some critics complained about Hoffman's over the top acting, a bit too ""kitch"". Well, maybe it was, but it seemed to be one of the few traces of real life, however ""overdone.""My strongest memory from the novel was the discovery that the main character, the infant who was to be given the name Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, played by relatively unknown actor Ben Whishaw, had no smell whatsoever. This comes very early in the novel, setting the scene for what is to motivate the principle character throughout the story. This revelation does not come out in the film until about 2/5 of the way through it, leaving us with no strong explanation for why Grenouille is so entranced by the smell of the young apricot seller (the Wikipedia plot summary says plums. They look far more like apricots to me.)The unique absence of all sent from the child is replaced in the film by its beginning with a scene where Grenouille is sentenced to a horrible execution. Most of the remainder of the film is a flashback about his life leading up to that scene, which plays out in a manner which should confirm (if nothing up to that point does not drive home this point) that the story is a fantasy. But it's a fantasy based on a very slim extrapolation of reality. What if a human had as acute a smell as a dog, for example. This is played out when Grenouille demonstrates for himself that his extract of the fragrance of his first victim is recognized by that victim's dog. We are reminded of this evidence later in the film.For those who are annoyed by spoilers in reviews, you may wish to stop now.I found several scenes in the film which were simply too unrealistic to accept, similar to a Sci Fi movie about people in outer space where they can hear sounds in the vacuum of space or they walk as if there were gravity where there can't be any. The most jarring was in the execution scene, where, having been stripped to the waist and chained to the wall of a locked cell, Grenouille manages to retain possession of not only his vial of perfume made from the 13 essences of the fragrance of his 13 victims, but he retains a handkerchief by which he can disperse the fragrance to the crowd assembled to view his execution. Perhaps the whole unreality of the scene is signaled when Grenouille arrives at the execution stage dressed like a dandy, in a carriage fit for royalty, instead of the hay cart we are so familiar with from the French Revolution.Less ""unreal"", but similarly jarring was the scene in Baldini's laboratory where Grenouille creates an improvement over a perfume Baldini was trying to copy. It was reasonable to believe that Grenouille's talent enabled him to identify the five or six components of this perfume, but as he himself states, he knows the smells, but he does not know the names or how to capture them. So how does Grenouille assemble the components he needs by selecting sealed containers, with labels. The business as Grenouille enters Baldini's laboratory suggests he can distinguish each of the smells from the hundreds of containers by smell alone. I suspect that would be beyond the capabilities of even a bloodhound.Bottom line is that the film is about the sense of smell, which may be virtually impossible to convey in a film. But wait, wasn't there a very successful film entitled ""The Scent of a Woman"" which seemed to succeed in conveying that idea. The very slow pace of this film, with precious little dialogue to speak of, tends to be just a bit boring. Which is odd, because my memory of the novel was that it was anything but boring. Here, Hoffman, pulls off a good scene or two, and Alan Rickman is almost totally wasted, with very little dialogue. If the roles of Narrator and  Antoine Richis, the 13th victim's father, were reversed, at least we would have been treated to Rickman's delightfully serious sounding voice. Hurt's voice seemed to lack character, the same way the principle character lacked a fragrance.The proper bookends of the film perhaps should have been Grenouille's triumph in finding a proper fragrance to replace his own lack of one.",3,"An ambitious film, which lacks a vital component.",1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,4810,"['film', 'Perfume', 'directed', 'cowriten', 'German', 'director', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'based', 'novel', 'read', 'shortly', 'was', 'published', '1985', 'recall', 'then', 'thinking', 'was', 'odd', 'story', 'seemed', 'have', 'few', 'cinematic', 'virtues', 'movie', 'confirm', 'point.The', 'first', 'thing', 'dialogue', 'thin', 'weak', 'broth', 'made', 'old', 'bones', 'find', 'disagreement', 'several', 'professional', 'critics', 'when', 'say', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'old', 'Parisian', 'perfumer', 'Baldini', 'scenes', 'have', 'least', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'exposition', 'character', 'rather', 'clinical', 'voice', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'narration', 'unseen', 'voice', 'critics', 'complained', 'Hoffman', 'top', 'acting', 'bit', 'too', 'kitch', 'Well', 'maybe', 'was', 'seemed', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'traces', 'real', 'life', 'however', 'overdone', 'strongest', 'memory', 'novel', 'was', 'discovery', 'main', 'character', 'infant', 'who', 'was', 'be', 'given', 'name', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Grenouille', 'played', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'had', 'smell', 'whatsoever', 'very', 'early', 'novel', 'setting', 'scene', 'what', 'motivate', 'principle', 'character', 'story', 'revelation', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'film', '2/5', 'way', 'leaving', 'strong', 'explanation', 'why', 'Grenouille', 'so', 'entranced', 'smell', 'young', 'apricot', 'seller', 'Wikipedia', 'plot', 'summary', 'plums', 'look', 'far', 'more', 'like', 'apricots', 'unique', 'absence', 'sent', 'child', 'replaced', 'film', 'beginning', 'scene', 'where', 'Grenouille', 'sentenced', 'horrible', 'execution', 'Most', 'remainder', 'film', 'flashback', 'life', 'leading', 'up', 'scene', 'out', 'manner', 'should', 'confirm', 'nothing', 'up', 'point', 'not', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'story', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'based', 'very', 'slim', 'extrapolation', 'reality', 'What', 'human', 'had', 'acute', 'smell', 'dog', 'example', 'played', 'out', 'when', 'Grenouille', 'extract', 'fragrance', 'first', 'victim', 'recognized', 'victim', 'dog', 'are', 'reminded', 'evidence', 'later', 'film.For', 'who', 'are', 'annoyed', 'spoilers', 'reviews', 'may', 'wish', 'stop', 'now.I', 'found', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'were', 'simply', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'accept', 'similar', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'movie', 'people', 'outer', 'space', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'sounds', 'vacuum', 'space', 'walk', 'were', 'gravity', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'most', 'jarring', 'was', 'execution', 'scene', 'where', 'having', 'been', 'stripped', 'waist', 'chained', 'wall', 'locked', 'cell', 'Grenouille', 'retain', 'possession', 'not', 'only', 'vial', 'perfume', 'made', '13', 'essences', 'fragrance', '13', 'victims', 'handkerchief', 'can', 'disperse', 'fragrance', 'crowd', 'assembled', 'view', 'execution', 'Perhaps', 'whole', 'unreality', 'scene', 'signaled', 'when', 'Grenouille', 'execution', 'stage', 'dressed', 'dandy', 'carriage', 'fit', 'royalty', 'instead', 'hay', 'cart', 'are', 'so', 'familiar', 'French', 'Revolution.Less', 'unreal', 'similarly', 'jarring', 'was', 'scene', 'Baldini', 'laboratory', 'where', 'Grenouille', 'improvement', 'perfume', 'Baldini', 'was', 'trying', 'copy', 'was', 'reasonable', 'believe', 'Grenouille', 'talent', 'enabled', 'identify', 'five', 'six', 'components', 'perfume', 'smells', 'not', 'know', 'names', 'how', 'capture', 'So', 'how', 'Grenouille', 'assemble', 'components', 'selecting', 'sealed', 'containers', 'labels', 'business', 'Grenouille', 'Baldini', 'laboratory', 'can', 'distinguish', 'smells', 'hundreds', 'containers', 'smell', 'alone', 'suspect', 'would', 'be', 'capabilities', 'even', 'bloodhound.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'sense', 'smell', 'may', 'be', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'convey', 'film', 'wait', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'very', 'successful', 'film', 'entitled', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'seemed', 'succeed', 'conveying', 'idea', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'film', 'precious', 'little', 'dialogue', 'speak', 'be', 'just', 'bit', 'boring', 'Which', 'odd', 'memory', 'novel', 'was', 'was', 'anything', 'boring', 'Here', 'Hoffman', 'good', 'scene', 'two', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'almost', 'totally', 'wasted', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'roles', 'Narrator', 'Antoine', 'Richis', '13th', 'victim', 'father', 'were', 'reversed', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'Rickman', 'delightfully', 'serious', 'sounding', 'voice', 'Hurt', 'voice', 'seemed', 'lack', 'character', 'same', 'way', 'principle', 'character', 'lacked', 'fragrance.The', 'proper', 'bookends', 'film', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Grenouille', 'triumph', 'finding', 'proper', 'fragrance', 'replace', 'own', 'lack', 'one']",N/A
1047680,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000MMN6YS,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","German born director Tom Tykwer slows things down quite a bit in PERFUME: THE STORY OF A MURDERER. Those in the know are probably aware of Tykwer's ultra-fast pacedRun Lola Run(1998) in which the action never stopped. But here in Perfume we get to see a completely different Tykwer, one with an eye for beautiful camera shots, incredible vistas, and stunning cinematography.Problems with the film became apparent, however, before the film ever got green-lit. Several directors considered the project before opting out. Among them were such notables as Ridley Scott, Tim Burton, Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, and even Stanley Kubrick (may he rest in peace). But fate - or karma or whatever you might believe in - intervened and plopped it in the lap of Mr. Tykwer, who quickly decided to make this feature event a spectacle beyond most imaginations. With an incredible budget of over $65 million (the largest ever from a German production company), the film was shot with an eye for artistic quality along with a flowing script. And it worked. It worked very well.The dark sets of 18th century France come alive (and frighteningly so) thanks to the shadowy sets and creepy main character of Jean-Baptiste Grenuille (Ben Whishaw,Layer Cake), a man with a gift for smells. Born to a careless and soon-to-be-dead mother, Jean-Baptiste's life is put under the microscope for the entire audience to see. Since being born on the streets of France (literally), Jean-Baptiste smells all of its greatness and stench. Being shuffled first to an orphanage where he fights for his infant life, to his life as a tanner, to his eventual acceptance into the business of a down-on-his-luck perfumer named Giuseppi Baldini (Dustin Hoffman,Kung Fu Panda), Jean-Baptiste demands more and more from his marvelous sense of smell. In fact, he wants to be able to bottle the smell of glass and other intangibles. Maybe even capture the scent of ...life? Beauty? Oh yes, even that.During a visit to the streets of France, Jean-Baptiste encounters his first truly magnificent smell, that of a lovely redhead. But her fear of him leads to her death and Jean-Baptiste worries he may never get that scent back.His fears are side-stepped, however, when he learns how to capture the smell of beautiful women, but only after killing them. Dread grips the countryside as women of all socio-economic classes are found murdered.A man with an acute sense of danger named Richis (Alan Rickman,Sweeney Todd) realizes the danger his only daughter Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is in and decides to flee with her across the country. But can distance save her when a human bloodhound is on your trail?Jean-Baptiste needs Laura in order to finish his scent de excellence and nothing appears to be able to stop him ...except for himself. His life has been a pursuit that no other person can share, and this has made him a truly lonely figure ...if not a non-entity in terms of humanity itself.This film came very close to being one of my top ten favorites, but fell a tad short thanks to what many call ""the orgy scene."" Although it was a nice twist from what I thought was going to happen, it really, really, REALLY stretched the imagination beyond any possibility of realism. Even so, it was filmed exceptionally well.Most surprising to me was that I hadn't realized how long this sucker was. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, it whizzed by; that's how engrossing much of the production was, including the acting, the (amazing) sets and costumes, and the sumptuous cinematography (pay particular attention to the red hair, especially when Laura is fleeing on horseback with her father).I intend to buy this film and keep it in my DVD library.",5,An Incredible Film and Story Well Told,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,3695,"['German', 'born', 'director', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'things', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'PERFUME', 'THE', 'STORY', 'A', 'MURDERER', 'know', 'are', 'probably', 'aware', 'Tykwer', 'ultra-fast', 'pacedRun', 'Lola', 'Run', '1998', 'action', 'never', 'stopped', 'here', 'Perfume', 'get', 'see', 'completely', 'different', 'Tykwer', 'one', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'shots', 'incredible', 'vistas', 'stunning', 'cinematography.Problems', 'film', 'became', 'apparent', 'however', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'green-lit', 'Several', 'directors', 'considered', 'project', 'opting', 'out', 'were', 'such', 'notables', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'even', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'may', 'rest', 'peace', 'fate', 'karma', 'might', 'believe', 'intervened', 'plopped', 'lap', 'Mr.', 'Tykwer', 'who', 'quickly', 'decided', 'make', 'feature', 'event', 'spectacle', 'most', 'imaginations', 'incredible', 'budget', '65', 'million', 'largest', 'ever', 'German', 'production', 'company', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'eye', 'artistic', 'quality', 'flowing', 'script', 'worked', 'worked', 'very', 'well.The', 'dark', 'sets', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'come', 'alive', 'frighteningly', 'so', 'thanks', 'shadowy', 'sets', 'creepy', 'main', 'character', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Grenuille', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'man', 'gift', 'smells', 'Born', 'careless', 'soon-to-be-dead', 'mother', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'life', 'put', 'microscope', 'entire', 'audience', 'see', 'being', 'born', 'streets', 'France', 'literally', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'greatness', 'stench', 'Being', 'shuffled', 'first', 'orphanage', 'where', 'infant', 'life', 'life', 'tanner', 'eventual', 'acceptance', 'business', 'down-on-his-luck', 'perfumer', 'named', 'Giuseppi', 'Baldini', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'more', 'more', 'marvelous', 'sense', 'smell', 'fact', 'be', 'able', 'bottle', 'smell', 'glass', 'other', 'intangibles', 'Maybe', 'even', 'capture', 'scent', 'life', 'Beauty', 'Oh', 'yes', 'even', 'that.During', 'visit', 'streets', 'France', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'first', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'smell', 'lovely', 'redhead', 'fear', 'death', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'worries', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'scent', 'back.His', 'fears', 'are', 'side-stepped', 'however', 'when', 'how', 'capture', 'smell', 'beautiful', 'women', 'only', 'killing', 'Dread', 'countryside', 'women', 'socio-economic', 'classes', 'are', 'found', 'murdered.A', 'man', 'acute', 'sense', 'danger', 'named', 'Richis', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'danger', 'only', 'daughter', 'Laura', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'decides', 'flee', 'country', 'can', 'distance', 'save', 'when', 'human', 'bloodhound', 'trail', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'needs', 'Laura', 'order', 'finish', 'scent', 'excellence', 'nothing', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'life', 'been', 'pursuit', 'other', 'person', 'can', 'share', 'made', 'truly', 'lonely', 'figure', 'not', 'non-entity', 'terms', 'humanity', 'itself.This', 'film', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'favorites', 'fell', 'tad', 'short', 'thanks', 'what', 'many', 'call', 'orgy', 'scene', 'was', 'nice', 'twist', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'really', 'really', 'REALLY', 'stretched', 'imagination', 'possibility', 'realism', 'Even', 'so', 'was', 'filmed', 'exceptionally', 'well.Most', 'surprising', 'was', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'how', 'long', 'sucker', 'was', 'nearly', 'two-and-a-half', 'hours', 'whizzed', 'how', 'engrossing', 'much', 'production', 'was', 'including', 'acting', 'amazing', 'sets', 'costumes', 'sumptuous', 'cinematography', 'pay', 'particular', 'attention', 'red', 'hair', 'especially', 'when', 'Laura', 'fleeing', 'horseback', 'father', 'intend', 'buy', 'film', 'keep', 'DVD', 'library']",N/A

They are all movies of desperation and violence.Tom Tykwer has been building up to this masterpiece. Going back to the break-neck pace he abandoned after Run Lola Run, he synthesizes all he learned from making Heaven, The Princess and the Warrior and (the best of the bunch)Winter Sleepers. Perfume is vastly superior to any of his earlier work. The pretentiousness that marred the earlier work is absent from Perfume.A wholly original period piece about a poverty stricken child who is shunned by his peers and whose superhuman sense of smell sets him on a course of obsession and murder is beautifully realized. Though this may be the best movie I've seen in six years, it is the best score I've heard in thirty five years. Tykwer is responsible for this, too.Out of nowhere, Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman come in with fine supporting performances. The real star though is Tykwer.

1047682,A9DEBL9JBKQBF,B000MMN6YS,Book Maven,"[7, 10]","I was eager to see another film directed by Tykwer since Run Lola Run is one of my all-time favourite films. This film has many great points: the cinematography is stunning in showing both squalor and beauty, the premise is an interesting one, and the supporting characters played by Hoffman and Rickman were spirited. However, despite these elements, the film was remarkably unmoving. It is diffucult to convey scent through images, and though the visuals were vibrant, enlivening scent through a non-olfactory medium is better done with words and a reader's imagination (I hear the book is great for this) rather than through pictures. (Scent directly and chemically affects the brain, but watching TV/movies puts our brains in a lull, sometimes deeper than sleep, so the medium works against its goal.) Ben Whishaw (playing Grenouille, ""Frog"" in English), though very handsome, does little to carry the main role; his range of emotions (though lauded by the director and producer in the speacial features bit) goes from bland to slighly blander. Since we are following HIS story, I'd like to feel more about him, whether admiration, disgust, empathy or hatred. But I feel nothing.In addition, the ending leaves a lot to be desired (spoiler coming). Everyone swooning and getting into scent-induced orgies over this ""dead-girl"" perfume? When did magical realism waltz its way into the film? That leap made me go from kind of liking the movie to really disliking it. If the audience is to suspend belief (when ""magic"" or supernatural wonders appear), this must be introduced earlier in the film. Otherwise it's like seeing a a war flick where a unicorn carries off a soldier in danger. Whishaw's character kills twelve or thirteen innocent women, so I wanted to see a just punishment for him. Having him essentially take his own life, not out of remorse but rather because he could never ""love or be loved like another human being"" makes me feel unsettled and cheated. LAck of love and depth of feeling is a sensible reason to kill oneself, but where does this angst come from? We only see one other scene hinting at him discovering an inner void (when he discovers he has no scent), but his discovery makes him want to show the world that he is special and important through his work, *not* making him want to become whole, emotionally fulfilled human. If he's to kill himself because he's vacant inside, we need to see more of him feeling his emptiness. All during the film he seems content to find comfort and obsessive joy in his work. A narrator voiceover and a flashback to an imagined scene of tenderness with his first murder victim is a sloppy, slap-dash way of showing this motivation.In all, I think this movie has a great beginning, but the last fifteen or twenty minutes completely spoil the film.",2,I find myself...not caring,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,2811,"['was', 'eager', 'see', 'film', 'directed', 'Tykwer', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'one', 'all-time', 'favourite', 'films', 'film', 'many', 'great', 'points', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'showing', 'squalor', 'beauty', 'premise', 'interesting', 'one', 'supporting', 'characters', 'played', 'Hoffman', 'Rickman', 'were', 'spirited', 'However', 'elements', 'film', 'was', 'remarkably', 'unmoving', 'diffucult', 'convey', 'scent', 'images', 'visuals', 'were', 'vibrant', 'enlivening', 'scent', 'non-olfactory', 'medium', 'better', 'done', 'words', 'reader', 'imagination', 'hear', 'book', 'great', 'rather', 'pictures', 'Scent', 'directly', 'chemically', 'brain', 'watching', 'TV/movies', 'brains', 'lull', 'sometimes', 'deeper', 'sleep', 'medium', 'goal', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'playing', 'Grenouille', 'Frog', 'English', 'though', 'very', 'handsome', 'little', 'carry', 'main', 'role', 'range', 'emotions', 'lauded', 'director', 'producer', 'speacial', 'features', 'bit', 'bland', 'slighly', 'blander', 'are', 'following', 'HIS', 'story', ""'d"", 'like', 'feel', 'more', 'admiration', 'disgust', 'empathy', 'hatred', 'feel', 'nothing.In', 'addition', 'ending', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'spoiler', 'coming', 'Everyone', 'swooning', 'getting', 'scent-induced', 'orgies', 'dead-girl', 'perfume', 'When', 'did', 'magical', 'realism', 'waltz', 'way', 'film', 'leap', 'made', 'go', 'kind', 'liking', 'movie', 'really', 'disliking', 'audience', 'suspend', 'belief', 'when', 'magic', 'supernatural', 'wonders', 'appear', 'must', 'be', 'introduced', 'earlier', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'seeing', 'war', 'flick', 'where', 'unicorn', 'soldier', 'danger', 'Whishaw', 'character', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'innocent', 'women', 'wanted', 'see', 'just', 'punishment', 'Having', 'essentially', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'not', 'remorse', 'rather', 'could', 'never', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'human', 'being', 'feel', 'unsettled', 'cheated', 'LAck', 'love', 'depth', 'feeling', 'sensible', 'reason', 'kill', 'where', 'angst', 'come', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'other', 'scene', 'hinting', 'discovering', 'inner', 'void', 'when', 'scent', 'discovery', 'want', 'show', 'world', 'special', 'important', 'work', '*not*', 'making', 'want', 'become', 'whole', 'emotionally', 'fulfilled', 'human', 'kill', 'vacant', 'inside', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'feeling', 'emptiness', 'film', 'content', 'find', 'comfort', 'obsessive', 'joy', 'work', 'narrator', 'voiceover', 'flashback', 'imagined', 'scene', 'tenderness', 'first', 'murder', 'victim', 'sloppy', 'slap-dash', 'way', 'showing', 'motivation.In', 'think', 'movie', 'great', 'beginning', 'last', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'completely', 'spoil', 'film']",N/A
1047683,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000MMN6YS,Brian E. Erland,"[8, 11]","`Perfume' released in '07 is one of the most absorbing, unpredictable, titillating, genre free films I've ever seen. It is a stylish and atmospheric period piece, a taut and perverse psychological thriller, a demented romance, and a dark, edgy comedy all rolled into one very surprising movie.

With that said I feel that Tom Tykwer has done an admirable job in bringing Patrick Suskind's unfilmable (to use Kubrick's words) novel to the screen.The film follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), an outcast with an incredible sense of smell throught 18th Century Paris. Grenouille uses his gift in order to find recognition and possibly even love and acceptance from those around him. Unfortunately he does it in the wrong way, he becomes a serial killer obsessed with making the perfect perfume. This perfume being created from the distilled essence of virgins.Along the way he is apprenticed to master perfumer Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman)who teaches him his craft and starts Grenouille on his macabre journey. There is also some fine acting on display from Alan Rickman as Richis the father of Grenouille's final victim.This is a film that relies heavily on its production design (Uli Hanisch) and its cinematography (Franke Griebe) in order to make the viewer feel and smell the sights and sounds of a filthy urban sprawl that was 18th century Paris. The novel was deemed unfilmable because it was thought that no film could capture this feel. Tykwer did a very good job even if the film is a little overlong for its own good. While the plot may not stand up to close scrutiny it does provide an interesting few hours in the dark. Many have commented on the strange ending but I feel that the ending helps the film reach its ultimate resolution.

How does one translate scent and aroma into visual imagery, and attempt to draw the audience in to the mind of a murderer while displaying his particular flair for the dramatic and sensual experience of smell? The obvious answer would be that it is quite difficult.This film, however, pulls it off beautifully. Anyone who enjoys artistic film pieces would be able to appreciate ""Perfume - The Story of a Murderer"" for it's daring and visually stunning accomplishment. The tale of a young perfumer with an incredible sense of smell, who goes on to attempt to ""bottle"" the very essence of a woman (by murdering her in order to create his amazing perfumes) is a shocking mind trip, and ends up being quite disturbing, even while it is visually and cinematically beautiful.The sounds heard throughout the film, and the images flickering across the screen are combined to give the audience a distinct smell they are meant to interpret.

1047695,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000MMN6YS,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 5]","As the title suggests, ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is a pure sensory experience, enveloping the audience into a seemingly unending and unconquerable world of scents. It was absolutely amazing that the filmmakers managed to immerse us in such a rich and varied realm: we're incapable of actually smelling the images as they appear on the screen. Nonetheless, we're able to understand what we're being asked to experience along with the main character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), who was born with an inhumanly strong sense of smell. As he wanders the streets of eighteenth-century France, his nose acts like a filing cabinet, collecting countless numbers of odors and storing them in his memory. Everything emitting a scent is shown to us through some clever camera angles, most of which are extreme close-ups of objects and bodies moving in slow motion.This first-hand look into Grenouille's world made for quite a unique experience, especially since we're being asked to address a sense that's quite useless for film watching. But his obsessive and ultimately murderous drive to capture the perfect scent enables us to transcend that handicap; even if we can't smell what he smells, various shots enable us to understand that he finds the scents of the world intoxicating. We also gain understanding with the help of John Hurt, the film's narrator. He's quite an important character, considering Grenouille is a young man of very few words. According to some background information, he didn't learn to speak for many years. He was unceremoniously born underneath a foul-smelling fish cart in Paris, the fifth child of a woman whose previous four children were stillborn.After she's arrested and executed for willful neglect, the infant is sent to an orphanage, and there he remains throughout his entire childhood. It's established almost immediately how unnerved the other children are around the now named Grenouille; he cannot speak, yet he develops a peculiar sense of smell, one that makes him perceptive to everyone around him. This marks the first in a series of plot devices that almost come off as supernatural, a quality that, if not viewed in the right frame of mind, may come off as completely ridiculous. There are a number of moments in this film that require suspension of disbelief. This is especially true of the final major sequence, in which a spur of the moment orgy takes place in the town square.This isn't to say that they detract from the effectiveness of the story. If anything, they enhance it. Keep in mind that Grenouille is a unique individual; not only is his sense of smell incredibly powerful, he also has no scent of his own. He doesn't learn this until he's older, at which point he's already been sold as cheap labor to a tannery owner.But this is when things take a much darker turn, and they only get darker as the film progresses. After years of remaining behind the confining walls of the tannery, Grenouille is finally asked to assist in making deliveries. At last, he has the chance to take in the various odors of the city, all of which he has yet to distinguish as bad or good. Then he gets a whiff of a young girl selling yellow plums, and the seduction is complete. He's not interested in buying any of her fruit; he only wants to bask in her heavenly aroma. Unfortunately, restraining her and choking her to death brings him no closer to capturing her scent. He then understands his purpose in life; he shall find the world's most enticing smells, collect them, and make them into a one-of-a-kind perfume.And as luck would have it, he makes a delivery to Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), an Italian perfumer. At one time, he was well respected and his shop was always full of customers. Now it seems as if he's past his prime, his attempts at creating the next great perfume being thwarted by rival businesses. But then he meets Grenouille, whose powerful nose allows him to pick out exactly the right scents and mix them in exactly the right amounts. Finally, he's found someone who can put him back in business. In becoming an amateur perfumer, Grenouille hopes to learn the fine art of capturing scents.Unfortunately, Baldini is only familiar with one capturing method: distilling various flora and fauna by boiling them in water. Grenouille's pursuits are far too grand for this method, and it shows through his unsuccessful attempts at distilling the essences of glass, various metals, and Baldini's cat (supposedly for the sake of experimentation). His only other option is a method used in Grasse, a city known for producing the highest quality perfumes: it involves animal fat, which can easily absorb scents. After the fat has been slathered onto flower petals, it is then scraped away, mixed with alcohol, and distilled into concentrated oil. Grenouille immediately leaves for Grasse, knowing that this method will serve his purpose.At this point, his obsession turns deadly; he kills a number of young girls, capturing their scents by slathering their naked bodies with animal fat, scraping it off, and boiling it with alcohol. I remember how uncomfortable I felt watching the fat sizzling in glass beakers; we're essentially witnessing a madman bottling youth, beauty, and innocence, all of which were previously impossible to collect. The very thought of someone being both skilled and heartless is not exactly pleasant, especially since he needs one more victim to perfect his perfume. Here enters Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), a young virgin who lives with her loving father, Antoine (Alan Rickman). Capturing her scent won't be so easy; Grenouille's murder spree has definitely gotten the city's attention.Such a fascinatingly dark story was enough to get my attention, as well; despite disturbing visuals and heavy-handed subject matter, ""Perfume"" is not easily dismissible. I watched it with grim focus, and I found myself waiting impatiently for the next turn of events. I don't know if I'm helping the film or hurting it by saying that they lead to a particularly odd ending; while I consider it appropriate, some my find it nonsensical and in poor taste. But you have to keep in mind that a supernatural story is being told. It may not seem that way at first; initial appearances make it seem like a straightforward period piece. But as soon as the infant Grenouille inhales the scent of an orphan boy's index finger, it becomes obvious that extraordinary things will happen. A lot of credit has to be given to such a film, especially one in which the everyday sense of smell is successfully woven into the narrative fabric.",5,The Sweet Smell of Obsession,1168300800,"01 9,

Slipman,"[1, 1]","German director Tom Tykwer, of ""Run Lola Run"" fame, should be commended for his outstanding adaptation of Patrick Suskind's novel ""Das Parfum"". Tykwer uses a series of authentic looking historical sets and impressive cinematographic close ups and zooms to depict Europe's largest city in the 1700's, Paris.  He uses his camera to convey the sense of aroma in the squalid, unhygienic metropolis which is essential to the plot.Born into the lowest rungs of society and immediately abandoned by his uncaring mother Jean Baptiste Grenouille, the anti-hero of ""Perfume"", must overcome long odds to survive the pitiful life of an orphan.  The grown up Grenouille played admirably by Ben Whishaw from the onset of life had been endowed with the most highly developed sense of olfaction.  He gets a chance to prove and enhance his gift under the tutelage of once renowned Parisian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini played by a heavily made up Dustin Hoffman.Obsessed with the art of perfuming, Grenouille at the insistence of Baldini treks to the city of Grasse to add to his skills.  A dark side of his personality reveals itself as he maniacally attempts to capture the ultimate scent.  He begins murdering attractive young women, and using the art of effluence uses their hair and bodily oils and scents to create a fragrance from each unfortunate victim.  His murderous actions cause a panic in the town and across the countryside.  Local beauty Laura played by Rachel Hurd-Wood and sheltered by her father played by Alan Rickman becomes Grenouille's ultimate target as the final ingredient in his perfect concoction.The finale was a bit of a stretch but overall the film which was a box office failure, was totally engrossing as the mellifluous tones of narrator John Hurt and the wonderful sets and costumes guide us through a satisfying viewing experience.",5,Compelling historical drama,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,1847,"['German', 'director', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'fame', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'outstanding', 'adaptation', 'Patrick', 'Suskind', 'novel', 'Das', 'Parfum', 'Tykwer', 'series', 'authentic', 'looking', 'historical', 'sets', 'impressive', 'cinematographic', 'close', 'ups', 'zooms', 'depict', 'Europe', 'largest', 'city', '1700', 'Paris', 'camera', 'convey', 'sense', 'aroma', 'squalid', 'unhygienic', 'metropolis', 'essential', 'plot.Born', 'lowest', 'rungs', 'society', 'immediately', 'abandoned', 'uncaring', 'mother', 'Jean', 'Baptiste', 'Grenouille', 'anti-hero', 'Perfume', 'must', 'overcome', 'long', 'odds', 'survive', 'pitiful', 'life', 'orphan', 'grown', 'up', 'Grenouille', 'played', 'admirably', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'onset', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'endowed', 'most', 'highly', 'developed', 'sense', 'olfaction', 'chance', 'prove', 'enhance', 'gift', 'tutelage', 'once', 'renowned', 'Parisian', 'perfumer', 'Giuseppe', 'Baldini', 'played', 'heavily', 'made', 'up', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman.Obsessed', 'art', 'perfuming', 'Grenouille', 'insistence', 'Baldini', 'treks', 'city', 'Grasse', 'add', 'skills', 'dark', 'side', 'personality', 'maniacally', 'capture', 'ultimate', 'scent', 'murdering', 'attractive', 'young', 'women', 'using', 'art', 'effluence', 'uses', 'hair', 'bodily', 'oils', 'scents', 'create', 'fragrance', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'murderous', 'actions', 'cause', 'panic', 'town', 'countryside', 'Local', 'beauty', 'Laura', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'sheltered', 'father', 'played', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Grenouille', 'ultimate', 'target', 'final', 'ingredient', 'perfect', 'concoction.The', 'finale', 'was', 'bit', 'stretch', 'film', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'was', 'totally', 'engrossing', 'mellifluous', 'tones', 'narrator', 'John', 'Hurt', 'wonderful', 'sets', 'costumes', 'guide', 'satisfying', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

If you can tolerate the TV series Bones, you'll do just fine.People that are tired of movies that trundle along in familiar ruts, and love the thrill of a movie that gets completely out the track and goes careening all over a cinematic/dramatic field.People that watch human behavior the way a birder watches magpies, buzzards, and hawks: they want to see what HAPPENS, NOT to make moral judgments about the carnage taking place.For those of you fence-sitters, what might tip you into picking this DVD up:  lush photography, deep sensuality, mostly good acting (come ON, Dustin Hoffman, you can say ""Basta!"" better than that!!), and a truly thought provoking exploration of the world of scent.A few minor gripes about the author of the book and the director of the movie.  WHEN can we humans get off the virgin thing? Specifically, the FEMALE virgin obsession (no one is going to write a book about the perfect scent being composed of the essence of male virgins). Secondly, during the orgy scene, we see man on woman/woman on man (required for mass audience appeal), female on female (men seem to like this), but no male on male (unless I missed it, maybe I should go back and watch it several times?).  A bit of timidity in film-making here?Lastly, the book, though set in the past, has a bit of a sci-fi aspect to it (pheromones ramped up to spectacular levels).  The hard sci-fi lover in me notes two things.  First, were an aerosolizable chemical that directly and lastingly accessed the pleasure centers of the brain ever developed, it just might have the affect portrayed in the movies.  BUT, a small proportion of the population is anosmic (lack a sense of smell).  Someone in the crowd at the climactic scene would have arranged a very different ending than what we saw.So much for splitting hairs.  I?

1047710,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B000MMN6YS,David A. Wend,"[5, 8]","I read Patrick Suskind's Perfume when it was published in English in 1986.  When I heard over the years that a movie version was planned I never thought it would become reality.  I was always a little uncertain how Grenouille would be presented since he is hardly a hero.  The film is an excellent adaptation of the book with a remarkable performance by Ben Whishaw as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.  Mr. Whishaw manages to convey the ""otherness"" of Grenouille; a feeling he conveys that he is different and an outsider.  He is relegated to his own world of smells and has no need to communicate with people.  The gaunt appearance that Mr. Whishaw achieves is perfect for his character.  It is equally interesting to see his passions aroused when he first detects the scent of a young woman selling fruit.  He truly comes alive and when he accidentally kills the girl his reaction is like a child that has killed a favorite pet; he does not know that he has done anything wrong: he had to relish the scent of the girl.Dustin Hoffman makes an interesting Giuseppe Baldini.  His nose is perfect for a perfumer and he does quite well with the role although his accent does not sound terribly Italian.  Alan Rickman is superb as Antoine Richis and Rachel Hurd-Wood, as his daughter Antoine Richis, is very attractive and entirely convinces you that she is an intelligent young woman who would rather do without marriage to the well-meaning but much older Marquis de Montesquieu.The supporting cast is excellent and beautifully fit into their characters.  The production is first rate and is entirely convincing from the start that you are in 18th century France with all of its squalor and filth.  The CGI effects are quite good, particularly the bridge where Baldini has his shop.  John Hurt lends his mellifluous voice to the film as the narrator, helping to fill us in on Grenouille's workings and motives.If you have read the book I think you will enjoy the film unconditionally.  For people who have not read the book, I hope you will find the experience a journey of the imagination.  While this is not a morality tale perhaps the moral of this story is that we cannot live (as Grenouille understands in the end) without love and be whole.",5,A Perfect Perfume,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,2236,"['read', 'Patrick', 'Suskind', 'Perfume', 'when', 'was', 'published', 'English', '1986', 'When', 'heard', 'years', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'planned', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'become', 'reality', 'was', 'always', 'little', 'uncertain', 'how', 'Grenouille', 'would', 'be', 'presented', 'hardly', 'hero', 'film', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'book', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Grenouille', 'Mr.', 'Whishaw', 'convey', 'otherness', 'Grenouille', 'feeling', 'different', 'outsider', 'relegated', 'own', 'world', 'smells', 'need', 'communicate', 'people', 'gaunt', 'appearance', 'Mr.', 'Whishaw', 'perfect', 'character', 'equally', 'interesting', 'see', 'passions', 'aroused', 'when', 'first', 'scent', 'young', 'woman', 'selling', 'fruit', 'truly', 'alive', 'when', 'accidentally', 'girl', 'reaction', 'child', 'killed', 'favorite', 'pet', 'not', 'know', 'done', 'anything', 'wrong', 'had', 'relish', 'scent', 'girl.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'interesting', 'Giuseppe', 'Baldini', 'nose', 'perfect', 'perfumer', 'quite', 'well', 'role', 'accent', 'not', 'sound', 'terribly', 'Italian', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'superb', 'Antoine', 'Richis', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'daughter', 'Antoine', 'Richis', 'very', 'attractive', 'entirely', 'convinces', 'intelligent', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'do', 'marriage', 'well-meaning', 'much', 'older', 'Marquis', 'Montesquieu.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'beautifully', 'fit', 'characters', 'production', 'first', 'rate', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'start', 'are', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'squalor', 'filth', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'particularly', 'bridge', 'where', 'Baldini', 'shop', 'John', 'Hurt', 'mellifluous', 'voice', 'film', 'narrator', 'helping', 'fill', 'Grenouille', 'workings', 'motives.If', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'unconditionally', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'hope', 'will', 'find', 'experience', 'journey', 'imagination', 'not', 'morality', 'tale', 'perhaps', 'moral', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'Grenouille', 'end', 'love', 'be', 'whole']",N/A

1047716,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B000MMN6YS,Dr. E,"[13, 15]","I read Suskind's work as an undergraduate ... and its details are still grotesquely etched on my brain. I cannot say that I ""liked"" the novel, but I was engrossed enough to complete it. Fast-forward a decade ... and the same applies to Tykwer's film-adaptation.Within the first few seconds, I felt a visceral repulsion to the film (as the viewer is expected to). The quick-cuts of the putrid marketplace creates revulsion and distance ... which is why many viewers here expressed a sense of ""not caring about the characters"" (this is valid). Likewise, Tykwer (true to Suskind) resists romanticizing Paris ... few directors are this straight-forward. The place is revealed as filthy, with a near-tangible stench (this is why we see members of aristocracy holding scented handkerchiefs under their noses). Even the long-shots of the city show stained, unappealing building facades. Who knew an artist could create a visual so fetid that the viewer can actual smell it?! Brilliance.Hoffman is convincing is his role as an aging perfumer. His portrayal of Giuseppe Baldini is as amusing as it is compelling. Likewise, Alan Rickman's ""Richis"" may be the character with whom the viewer can align her/himself. He is the voice of reason ... all of his ""paranoid"" obsessions are completely justified ... but no one will listen. His frustration is ours. Still, this is not enough to forge a connection between the film and the viewer. We find ourselves not caring when his beautiful daughter is being hunted for her scent. (And there is an attempt at garnering emotion ... evident in the delicate replacing of the flower on her mother's grave).This is a film with no catharsis (which is fine), but couple that with its dreary setting and vulgar displays, and the film becomes impossible to ""like."" This does not mean the film fails to intrigue, it simply means that a viewer may walk-away feeling empty. And, perhaps worse, wondering why the film was created at all. And, yes, it is true that Kubrick was intrigued by the text, but found it ""unfilmable."" I wonder what spurred Tykwer to tackle the text a master found ""unfilmable""? One is forced to assume hubris was at work here ... and this gamble was not a (TECHNICALLY) successful one. The budget for this work was a staggering $65,800,000 and was an epic, box-office failure. In fact, I have never before or after read such a vehement review from the much esteemed Chicago Sun-Times Richard Roeper: ""Hated this movie. Hated it"" (his literal words). Still, consider the equally (perhaps even more) esteemed Ebert who found it ""brave"" (to paraphrase). I think it may be JUST that polarizing.My middle-of-the-road review is both an acknowledgment of the film's artistic merits and a recognition of its tendency to evince viewer-apathy (including mine).If you have an interest in seeing Suskind's work on-screen buy this film. If you were a huge fan of ""Lola Rennt"" (Run Lola Run) then buy this film. However, if you are entering this work ""blind"" ... you may wish to rent it first.",3,"""He's an angel!"" ...

Touch, taste and smell rarely come into it.But acclaimed German director Tom Tykwer manages to make us smell things, in his most disturbing movie to date, ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer."" This time around, the talented Tykwer abandons his usual lovers-against-the-world stories for a lushly-filmed, darkly comic story of olfactory obsession. Yes, that is what I said.Jean-Baptiste Grenouillle (Ben Whishaw) is a man with a brilliant sense of smell, and zero body odor. He was born in a putrid fishmarket, raised in an orphanage, and later escapes from a tannery where he was working. He's enraptured by the many thrilling smells in the city -- he even kills a young girl, so that he can smell her lovely scent.In his search for the perfect scent, Jean-Baptiste gets a job with a once-famed perfume-maker (Dustin Hoffman). But after learning that not everything has a scent, he begins killing women to try to distill their scents into the ultimate perfume -- with beautiful redhead Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) as the ""thirteenth scent."" But his ultimate scent has an even more sinister side, as his scents begin to affect the population in unusual ways.""Perfume"" is Tykwer's most unique movie to date, and the one that definitely identifies him as a cinematic master. There are lots of music that are evocative, sensual, colourfully beautiful, or unspeakably creepy, but not many manage to be all of them. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is all of those, and more.Obviously a movie doesn't smell like anything, except maybe stale popcorn. So Tykwer uses sight for smell -- rotted fish, maggots, moldy walls from the late 1700s to show Jean-Baptiste's miserable origins. And he uses sparkling colour and windblown trees for nicer scents. Colour takes the place of scent itself -- bright red Lola hair on multiple girls, flowers that seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food. It gives the visuals a fairy-tale vibrancy.In fact, the scripting almost comes second to the exquisite cinematography. Yet Tykwer is able to bring across the powerful symbolism that brings the movie to life -- the smells are symbolic of love itself, which the scentless and amoral Jean-Baptiste does not have. He can only try to take it from others, with a finale that is the very image of poetic justice.Jean-Baptiste himself is one of those love/hate characters, and Whishaw does an excellent job with his sort of half-crazy, intent stare. And there are some great supporting performances by Alan Rickman as Antoine Richis (Laura's dad) and Hoffman as the eccentric old perfume-maker -- he adds a welcome note of comedy.A movie is dependent on sight, but Tom Tykwer creates a movie that you can almost smell.

The story takes place in the 18th century and tells the magic realist story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) who was born with an extraordinary olfactory ability which led him in his quest for the perfect scent. Dustin Hoffman also stars as the perfume maker Guiseppe Baldini, whom Jean-Baptiste is an apprentice under. Jean-Baptiste is something of a social misfit who comes to realize that he has no scent of his own unlike other people. This sets him apart from others and makes him somewhat invisible, scent wise, from others. His quest for the perfect scent is something of a search for his own identity in the world. Lacking a social conscience this amoral character murders women in order to acquire their scent for his perfect perfume mix. This diabolical enterprise leads to a surprising turn of events in the later part of the movie. In a movie which feels largely realistic in the early parts it becomes pure magical fantasy towards the end with an amazing conclusion. This sumptuously filmed movie takes us through the gritty streets of Paris and into the splendid gardens of the wealthy Antonine Richis (Alan Rickman), who lives in perfume capital of the world in Grasse, France, along the French Riviera.The dvd has a 13 minute long feature about the making of the film with interviews with the director and cast.

1047730,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000MMN6YS,Galina,"[1, 1]","""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" (2006) is directed by Tom Tykwer (Lola rennt (1998), Der Krieger und die Kaiserin (2000), and Heaven (2002)) and based on the bestselling novel by Patrick Susskind which is one of the most amazing debuts in the world literature. The novel was written in 1985 and has been translated into 45 languages, so far selling more than 15 million copies worldwide, making it the most successful novel of post-war German literature. Having been known as un-filmable, the novel presented the ultimate challenge for any director who would decide to adapt it the screen. How is it possible to transfer to the screen the myriads of odors that practically crawl and jump from every sentence of each page to envelop and to overwhelm the readers?...""Perfume"" tells the story of Jean-Baptist Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) a young man, who was born in Paris fish market in 1738 and was not supposed to live at all just like his four siblings that had been killed by their mother minutes after they were born but who survived and brought to the world with him double curse of not having any smell of his own and to be able to recognize, memorize, and later to capture every odor existed (or was that a blessing?). He grew up to become obsessed by the idea of creating the perfect perfume, the one that would capture the fragrance of love, devotion, and desire. To create the perfume like that, he would need the ingredients that could only be obtained by capturing essence of the unique scent, an indelible part of the young, beautiful, and innocent women that effortlessly evoke love, admiration, tenderness, and desire in everyone who'd approach them. Not even a human being but rather a creature for whom there is no word to describe, the monster with the divine sense of smile, the depository of myriads of odors, the evil genius obsessed by the perfection and beauty that he never was able to approach and to possess, Jean-Baptist Grenouille would stop to nothing to reach his terrifying and fascinating goal.I believe that Tom Tykwer made an astounding film that is perfect with the exception of a short scene few minutes before the film was over. Tykwer decided to make his anti-hero sympathetic - just for a couple of minutes and it was a wrong decision that goes against the character's logic, against everything we've learned about Jean-Baptist Grenouille. Other than that, I found the movie outstanding in all departments. It is the true Ode to Olfaction where the sense of smell was presented by the incredible, fantastic images combined with the music written by director himself and adding marvelously to the strange, dark, disturbing, and sensual world of mystery, murders, beauty, and obsession. The film director recreated the 18th century France beautifully by shooting the Paris scenes in Barcelona, Spain, and the ones that take place in Grasse, the capital of French perfumers, in Figueres, Spain, the city of Salvador Dali. Just like the novel, the film presents rather pessimistic and un-flattering outlook at the mankind and in this regard, the final two scenes are absolutely brilliant in their morbid irony.",5,"""Whatever his insane scheme is...""",1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,3143,"['Perfume', 'Story', 'Murderer', '2006', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'Lola', 'rennt', '1998', 'Der', 'Krieger', 'die', 'Kaiserin', '2000', 'Heaven', '2002', 'based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'Susskind', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'debuts', 'world', 'literature', 'novel', 'was', 'written', '1985', 'been', 'translated', '45', 'languages', 'so', 'far', 'selling', 'more', '15', 'million', 'copies', 'worldwide', 'making', 'most', 'successful', 'novel', 'post-war', 'German', 'literature', 'Having', 'been', 'known', 'un-filmable', 'novel', 'presented', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'director', 'who', 'would', 'decide', 'adapt', 'screen', 'How', 'possible', 'transfer', 'screen', 'myriads', 'odors', 'practically', 'crawl', 'jump', 'sentence', 'page', 'envelop', 'overwhelm', 'readers', 'Perfume', 'story', 'Jean-Baptist', 'Grenouille', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Paris', 'fish', 'market', '1738', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'live', 'just', 'four', 'siblings', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'mother', 'minutes', 'were', 'born', 'who', 'survived', 'brought', 'world', 'double', 'curse', 'not', 'having', 'smell', 'own', 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'memorize', 'later', 'capture', 'odor', 'existed', 'was', 'blessing', 'grew', 'up', 'become', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'creating', 'perfect', 'perfume', 'one', 'would', 'capture', 'fragrance', 'love', 'devotion', 'desire', 'create', 'perfume', 'would', 'need', 'ingredients', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'obtained', 'capturing', 'essence', 'unique', 'scent', 'indelible', 'part', 'young', 'beautiful', 'innocent', 'women', 'effortlessly', 'evoke', 'love', 'admiration', 'tenderness', 'desire', 'everyone', 'who', ""'d"", 'approach', 'Not', 'even', 'human', 'being', 'rather', 'creature', 'whom', 'word', 'describe', 'monster', 'divine', 'sense', 'smile', 'depository', 'myriads', 'odors', 'evil', 'genius', 'obsessed', 'perfection', 'beauty', 'never', 'was', 'able', 'approach', 'possess', 'Jean-Baptist', 'Grenouille', 'would', 'stop', 'nothing', 'reach', 'terrifying', 'fascinating', 'goal.I', 'believe', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'made', 'astounding', 'film', 'perfect', 'exception', 'short', 'scene', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'Tykwer', 'decided', 'make', 'anti-hero', 'sympathetic', 'just', 'couple', 'minutes', 'was', 'wrong', 'decision', 'character', 'logic', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'Jean-Baptist', 'Grenouille', 'Other', 'found', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'departments', 'true', 'Ode', 'Olfaction', 'where', 'sense', 'smell', 'was', 'presented', 'incredible', 'fantastic', 'images', 'combined', 'music', 'written', 'director', 'adding', 'marvelously', 'strange', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'sensual', 'world', 'mystery', 'murders', 'beauty', 'obsession', 'film', 'director', 'recreated', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'beautifully', 'shooting', 'Paris', 'scenes', 'Barcelona', 'Spain', 'ones', 'take', 'place', 'Grasse', 'capital', 'French', 'perfumers', 'Figueres', 'Spain', 'city', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'Just', 'novel', 'film', 'rather', 'pessimistic', 'un-flattering', 'outlook', 'mankind', 'regard', 'final', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'morbid', 'irony']",N/A

He loves them all and makes no distinctions between bad and good scents.I am someone who adores perfumes and have quite a collection so the beginning of the movie really touched a chord with me about how he soaks in all the scents almost as though they were tangible objects. The movie does a good job of showing the smells as tangible objects, too.I found the move to be wonderfully haunting, beautiful cinematography and when the search for the ultimate scent leads to him murdering women (although why he couldn't have explained what he wanted to do beforehand, then got a woman who was willing) it felt like a child who wonders why he gets hit by a truck when he runs out on the road.All he wanted was the scent, this kind of magical, awesome scent that would change the world, and because he murders to do it, the movie is deeply dark and haunting.I have never seen a film quite like it, and I have never read the book though I tried but all the descriptions slowed the pace too much for me.The ending was a bit farfetched as if one drop couild transform a crowd of people, so I felt this was overdone, but the main character does a good job of being this darkly strange man who has trouble escaping his obsession, until he just gives into it and searches and searches for the scent he knows he can create.This did not feel like a horror film to me.

1047735,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000MMN6YS,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","PERFUME - THE STORY OF A MURDERER may not succeed on every level. Based on the novel DAS PERFUM by Patrick S&uuml;skind and prepared for the screen by Andrew Birkin, Bernd Eichinger, and director Tom Tykwer, this is a story more about the senses than about people.  The main character is not the sort of man with whom we can identify, but the progress of this crazed youth into the olfactory madness of serial killing for the sake of creating perfumes does provide an opportunity to study life in the 18th century in a way seldom available for viewers.  It is clumsy in spots, protracted in length, and a bit tedious in the telling, but visually this is a movie that is a feast (?) for the eyes.Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born in poverty and while he is thought to be stillborn, he survives and is found to have an extraordinary sense of smell. His youth is spent in work houses and slavery until one famous Italian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), living in Paris, discovers Grenouille's gifts and takes him on as an apprentice.  The lad learns the technique of vaporizing and boiling essences but when he asks Baldini how to capture the smell of 'anything at all' (particularly the scent of women), Baldini sends him off to study the technique of 'enfleurage', a manner of embedding flowers in fat until their essences are absorbed yield a pure form in the distillation of the melted fat.  Grenouille begins to capture women to coat them in fat to obtain their scent and in doing so he begins his cycle of murders of the victims.  When he encounters the lass Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) who would steal his attention, her father Richis (Alan Rickman) finally puts and ending to the macabre tale of Perfume.In many ways, though the cast performs well, the star of the production is the cinematography by Frank Griebe and the accompanying musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and (yes) Tom Tykwer. At 147 minutes the movie is too long for the story, but the setting and moods created are well worth watching.

I compare it with Amadeus because of the setting, the extraordinary sets, with Prestige because of how effective and tactful the film-making is - unpredictable. Why I compare it with Passion of the Christ and maybe even Apocalypto because of the crime & punishment factor. It is American Beautyish because the central character goes through certain varied self-absorbed emotions to get what he wants. And then the character sees nothing but he wants and what he must do both in and out of order.I do not know why people didn't like the film. I'm happy some didn't get it.

This movie got essentially no promotion in the US so I am surprised that I even stumbled onto it. This film had me hooked right from the ugly beginning of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille's birth in the most vile and repugnant place imaginable.The narration by John Hurt is tremendous and intriguing, as is the film's musical score. I found the score's instrumentation, coupled with the operatic female voicing, quite beautiful, immersive and evocative.Make no mistake, this is a dark story that is not for everyone. I feel the twisted tale is told in about the most filmic and gorgeous way possible, given the uncomfortable subject matter. The cinematography is amazing, as is the direction of photography throughout the film. The colors pop off the screen, particularly the doomed and gorgeous red haired beauty in the film. Take notice the depth, detail and color in her eyes, skin, clothes and hair, I was awestruck.This movie comes with a strong recommendation from this viewer, although my tastes are admittedly more towards the dark and macabre. However, there is an abundance of grace and majesty in this fairytale that is sure to appeal to any astute film fan.The film's video transfer is very solid and looks great with few issues. Color and depth are superb, along with solid black levels throughout.The film's primary audio tracks are DTS HD - HR (no lossless track exists on this disc) in English and German. All the extras are in German as well. The higher bit rate DTS lossy tracks do a solid job and are an improvement to the lower bite rate DD lossy track on the US DVD release. Surround activity is very limited; perhaps a full lossless codec would improve this, it's hard to say.I would think that a US Blu Ray release of this film will come eventually but who knows when that will be; since this movie has little recognition in the domestic US. If you are a fan of Perfume, this release is a substantial upgrade to the existing DVD and well worth adding to your collection.This imported Blu Ray played perfectly in my US Region A Sony BD player so there is no region lock on this disc.

But what really won me over was the fantastic subtext that developed as the story went on.Sure, there's a ""to catch a killer"" aspect to the film which, on it's own is enjoyable to see played out.  But there is so much more being said in this film.  Paris is depicted as a city of two classes.  One, a filth-ridden cesspool of poverty.  The other, a wealthy exclusive minority who at once co-exist with the filthy poor and at the same time pretend they don't exist.The rich can't help but see AND smell how awful conditions are for the poor masses, but cannot be bothered to consider the injustice of it while living their lives of excess and privelige.  Perfume, very much a staple of upper class fashion, is a vehicle for this social denial in the film.  A luxury available only to the wealthy, perfume is a way to ""cover up"" the unpleasant social truth that exists all around the them.One of the invisible poor is the main character of the film.  Gifted with a special talent, he becomes determined, (in his twisted way) to break through his purgatory of invisibility and capture the distilled olfactory essence of human beauty itself.  His mission leads him naturally to target, infiltrate and affect the world of the wealthy.  He doesn't do this by pretending to be one of them though. Instead he uses his invisibility to his advantage, much the way a virus might infiltrate a body undetected, then make it sick.  There is a social class subtext at work here that should not be missed.Toward the end of the film, the plot takes an unexpected turn.  Not a gimmicky M.

Ben Wishaw hits the essence of Grenouille brilliantly (he's intended to be emotionally flat.)  My wife doesn't like violent movies; but she has read the novel and really enjoyed this film.  Almost all aspects of the film are excellent.  Hoffman turns in his usual good performance.  The general mood is just right.The only flat part was (amazingly to me because I usually love his performances) Alan Rickman: he was either terribly misdirected or maybe miscast. Not sure, but his performance didn't fit for me.The public square scene and the final scene were amazingly well conceived and executed. I was wondering whether they would even film them. Brilliant.  I also didn't know how they could do the opening scene or the ""cave scene,"" or even if they would try.  But they did them all, very well.

1047748,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000MMN6YS,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 5]","There is such a fascination in adapting famous books to the cinema language, for both filmmakers and film-viewers, especially if the book is a famous best seller one. Comparisons will take place, no doubt. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is almost a collective part of a lot of people's memory and wakes curiosity the film itself. So I clearly see that the cinema language is absolutely different than literature language (in all genres)? Anyhow, expectations are served. Jean-Baptiste is someone special since he is born, in the middle of a fish market, where the smelling was everywhere except in him. As he grows, the scents and smelling becomes his path for pleasure, for recognizing, for commitments. In his memories he keeps all kind of scents, even without knowing where they come from, and he tries to bring them back to reality, as perfumes. When he achieves it, he attempts to create his best perfume, moral apart, regardless of the way he does it. ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,"" is a great manufactured film, no doubt, great scenarios, great cinematography, create custom design. The film, although basically a German production, was filmed in English, not being the first time (perhaps for an international appeal?),I didn't actually mention 'good editing' among the virtues of ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer.""  Some of the most exciting moments of the film, are when some scents call the attention of some characters (the plum girl, Baldini, Dominique, the orgy, etc), and the way the film 'tries' to show us the effect on them is with fast and short cuts, 'a-la-Hollywood', which I am not saying is bad, but it is just too rapid in the visual way, and not as subtle as a scent actually would work. A resource which is over-used lately in a lot of films is the close-up. And I guess that happens when a director finds kind of non-easy to portray a character, so, let us see at least a close-up of the actor. Again, lack of subtlety. So, I wouldn't even praise the achievement in make up in this film, only for showing us closely the noses and faces of some actors. I am not the greatest fan of Tom Tykwer, yet I think he's a good director, but as a stage-director, he may lose some control on his actors, that lead us to see Alan Rickman as a flat character and Dustin Hoffman seem miscast and a bit over the top, even as a silly perfumer, Ben Whishaw is fantastic for creating and developing his own Jean-Baptiste (watch his tics) and it's hard to avoid to see him a bit overacted in some scenes. Jessica Schwartz in her short role is great; she has what is called presence. And the orgy's scene made me laugh for moments; I would rather have felt embarrassed. Another resource which is sometimes unnecessarily used is the voice-off. I am not disappointed with ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer."" I was entertained, I enjoyed the experience, but I have to be honest by saying the typical phrase ""it could've been better..."".

I think the rodent was the tip off. But man when they sell a movie, they really hook you and--ok--it's not something I would--I didn't watch the interviews with the film makers cause--ah--I didn't want to spoil the bouquet.And of course death has its lingering scent--Andy Warhol's Frankenstein proved that--it's just--well--it's a long movie or maybe not. And it is based on an unfilmable novel--some reviews say--and I'd take that as a measure of warning--well what I'm trying to say,  without spoiling the surprises, and that is one tough thing to do--let's just say you may be singing Good Morning, Starshine or Hair by the time the perfume just soaks into everything--the room, the furniture, the aforementioned hair--It's just--getting back to that what we would like to happen in the middle of a novel we're forced to read in school--and you want to run from the room when your face is just about as full of blood as it can get--that rodent scene kind of makes one feel the same way--course the stench of France then--well--you gotta smell then you gotta smell, I say.Remember Hans Conreid on an I Love Lucy show reciting his poem that ends with ""....I just love to stand there and smell""? It's kind of a huge practical--well, I don't want to spoil the vintage here--I would have loved to have seen this in an art theatre--not really--and go around giving the audience a hot foot--cause that would be liberating--kind of symbolic too I guess--Oh come on, the movie stinks, the thing is a practical joke, there is one line toward the last that will leave you in hysterical laughter, so see the thing, really, cause it's just one of the most--well, you remember Goldman's law concerning more than one writer, or two writers--this film could have used William Goldman as script doc--don't think I'll be buying the novel it's based--it's based on a novel? Lord. Is there no shame?Any how..it's a movie to give one that smell of delusion, not to mention the drugs they must have been on when they made this--you remember Snidley Whiplash? And how we hated him? But we loved him too cause he was so Snidley. Doesn't have anything to do with Perfume: The Story of a Killer--just wanted to mention it. But it's good Dustin Hoffman's grandfather still gets work--his house caves in--well--it's like they're saying just how long can they string us along here?And from some of these reviews apparently a long long time. It's a movie about murder. And it's--well--the breakout comedy hit of the year. Get that blu-ray--yep--do get that blu-ray. Honest. It's a love in, yes sir, with some of the ugli---well never mind.

I knew I was in for something special when the movie began in 18th century France and people looked unhealthy, filthy, & stench-ridden.  Although I must note that they did not get the teeth right.  Up until last century, oral health for the majority of the population was of little concern.  By in large, people's gums were diseases, and their teeth ugly, and their breath beyond foul.

At odds in the world, he acquires an unusual gift, the gift of smell, and not just any gift...one of extraordinary and unique talent. Unable or unwilling to speak, Jean-Louis Baptist prefers to use his sense of smell to define his environment, to define the world as he knows and understands it. To him words are too primitive and restricting to communicate what he sees, hears, or wants to say.Sold twice over, what seems like a dismal existence to work in a tannery he one day discovers a smell so profound, so intoxicating and so beautiful he is forever changed and is obsessed with obtaining its essence. He finds himself in an apprenticeship as a perfumist where he learns the art and skill of obtaining the essence of smell, but it still is not enough. That unique smell that he discovered from a woman has him so self obsessed; he stops at nothing to obtain it. Through trial and error he constantly experiments to find a way until one day he does with a prostitute.From there he goes on a killing spree, as a 19th. Century serial murder in order to obtain the essence of smell from the most beautiful and purest of women to create the most perfect perfume the world has ever known. At long last he is caught and stands to be executed upon the eve that he will unveil his creation. A perfume extracted from 12 young women that is so perfect, so intoxicating, he can bend the will of mankind with it. He is found to be not guilty and deemed, ""an Angel"" and released. In the end he chooses his own fate and demise, and the secret of his perfect perfume dies with him.I found this film to be extremely well done. Excellently written and adapted from the novel, a great cast (both Allan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman are great to see onscreen). I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to nearly the end. I found the end to be a slight let down, and a bit of a ""cop out"".I didn't care much for the town orgy scene. I know that both the novelist and the director were trying to create a scene that was very poetic/artsy, even surreal, but it didn't really do it for me. Perhaps I would need to see it again to see if there is something I missed? The end, well...I was a little disappointed with the end also. Far too easy of an ending, as if the novelist or director got ""lazy"" and ""just wanted to finish"". Still, it was a great story, I really did enjoy it.

The poor bugger survives this as well as further abuse in an orphanage and as a work slave in a tannery.  His career as a murderer comes about because of his obsession with scent, particularly that of young women, which I imagine is related to his early deprivation.  The story becomes eerie and then weird and (believe it or not) funny and finally a dark myth.  It is one of the strangest and most satisfying films I have seen.

Not having read the book, I had no basis from which to judge it before seeing it for the first time on DVD.  And now, having seen it, I have to admit that I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about the thing.  It's just . . . so strange.Good things first: I found the imagery in the film to be quite arresting.  The colors were lush and vibrant, really bounding off the screen at you.  And the art direction was superb.  As other reviewers have attested, you really can almost *smell* this movie.  It's one of the few period pieces I've seen where everyone looks appropriately dirty, as if they could use a nice soapy shower.  I enjoyed the narration and all of the performances.  Alan Rickman was especially marvelous, and the main character, played by Ben Whishaw (an actor apparently more famous for the stage than anything else . . . for now) was perfectly cast.  He was creepy, yet somehow strangely alluring. In spite of myself, I managed to build up some empathy for him, though he is one of the creepiest film characters I've ever seen.The drawbacks of the movie are not necessarily drawbacks.  They just come so far out of left field that it's difficult to really step back and judge them at this point, when I am still recovering from shock.  Let's just say that *SPOILER ALERT!!* I've never seen a movie that contains both a massive orgy AND cannibalism.  Who'da thunk it?  There are also several things in the movie that are not really explained and don't make a whole lot of sense, such as the glowing light that emanates from a room after a key murder, and the trail of death the lead character (inadvertently?) leaves behind him.On the whole, this movie should be seen, if only to be believed.  One of the people I was watching with left for nearly an hour to take a phone call, and when she came back and we told her what she'd missed, she was dubious, to say the least.  It's definitely something you have to stick with, despite its often bizarre and intensely creepy twists.  I settled on four stars because overall, I DID like the movie . . .

The story of a man born with no scent of his own but on a constant hunt for something that he can capture and anoint with to fit in is magnetic. I have never heard of a more interesting take on the world of scent mixed in with murder.Ben Whishaw  as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was enigmatic, quiet, spooky, passionate and evil. I traveled though a flurry of emotions for him and his victims, knowing that his quest was very interesting yet it left a trail of despair and broken hearts of those who lost their loved ones. Death in the name of beauty if not a new phenomenon but it certainly is twisted when someone else has to pay the price. Alan Rickman, who also  plays Snape in Harry Potter movies, brings his uniqueness into the tale. The timber of his voice fits perfectly with the whole ethereal feel of the movie. His ruby haired daughter played by Rachel Hurd-Wood is Laura, the final ingredient on Grenouille's list to a heavenly scent.18th century France comes alive in this fantastic movie. I have never seen so much filth, dirt and grease in any costume movie but it was all worth it, and I swear my senses of smell were heightened for hours after watching it. The extremely long list of makeup artists at the end credits confirmed my suspicion that this was done with meticulous care to breath more life into the story.  The soundtrack is marvelous, the scenery breathtaking and everything simply tingles with richness.

And what the nose knows seems to be what the eyes know, except that what separates the killer in ""Perfume"" from an inbred madman of ""The Devil's Rejects"" ilk is that Jean-Baptiste doesn't rape his victims. This makes him merely misunderstood and lovelorn. So it's like ""Interview With a Vampire"" or the dracula movie with Keannu Reeves, DC's Sandman, ""The Crow,"" The Penguin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame -- just another tortured soul looking for a woman who can melt his frigid heart.

The acting was good enough and the premise even interesting. But, still, it was repugnant.

Slaughter isn't beautiful.And, that's the thing right there. I didn't read the book and don't plan to. Yet, I understand what the filmmaker was doing and what the author of the book was trying to do. However, it doesn't work unless you realize the joke is actually on those who enjoyed it.

The murder of innocents isn't beautiful no matter what nice things are created from their blood. This film is fake art and fake beauty.

Such is the challenge Tom Tykwer (the audacious ""Run, Lola, Run"") accepted when he decided to film ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,"" the wildly popular cult novel by Patrick Suskind first printed in the US in 1986. Intrinsic to the success of telling the tale of ""Perfume"" is to convey a palpable sense of ""smell"" and its intoxicating powers. While a book may do this with pages and pages of prose, a film does not have this descriptive luxury--hence, it must attempt some sort of visual shorthand.

While this may sound like dubious praise, it is actually the highest compliment.Set in 18th century France, ""Perfume"" relates the tragic tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw). Born and almost killed in a fish market, raised in an orphanage, put into manual (and often dangerous) service at a young age, Jean-Baptiste is a disaffected and disconnected youth. Having no social skills and lacking any kind of normal emotional processes, the one thing that differentiates Jean-Baptiste is his keen sense of smell. It seems to be the only thing that connects him to the world he lives in. A chance visit to the city brings him to a perfume shop/manufacturer. Captivated by this world that revolves around the olfactory senses, Jean-Baptiste aggressively pursues a position with the proprietor (Dustin Hoffman). After achieving some success and freedom, he becomes obsessed with procuring the perfect scent--one that he once smelled in the ""essence"" of a beautiful young woman. Jean-Baptiste's obsessive bent soon leads to murder (no spoiler here, it is the title) as he seeks to extract this intoxicating smell from his victims. It's as if creating this one perfect scent will somehow humanize him--but to attempt it, he becomes even more monstrous.In the opening minutes of ""Perfume,"" I was absolutely blown away. The visual impact of the early scenes is astonishing and unique. The tale, however, does settle down into a more routine and more familiar pattern. But while it doesn't maintain the frenetic and captivating pace, it is never less than intriguing and certainly beautiful to view. Technically, the film is awesome. I've already mentioned art direction and editing, but scoring, cinematography, and costuming are all top notch. Jean-Baptiste, who is really in every scene, can be a challenging central character--Whishaw plays him fairly vacantly. It is a one note performance, but largely because that's what the story calls for--a certain emotional flatness. Therefore, I thought it was effective--others might find it somewhat empty.I suspect many will absolutely loathe ""Perfume,"" however, for I have yet to speak about the ending. The ending is absolutely outrageous, and I suspect that it will polarize audiences into ""love it/hate it"" camps. It's so over-the-top, so unlike anything you might foresee, and so unlike anything you've ever witnessed in a film before. Yet, for me, these excesses worked and fit well with the tone of this lurid little tale. Love it or hate it, it's a bold choice--and one you're not likely to forget. So I am recommending ""Perfume"" for those that like something different--this is not standard Hollywood fare, and I mean that in a good way.

He grows up in an orphanage, never knowing a kind word or deed, perceiving and relating to his harsh life only through smell.  When as a teen, he sees a beautiful young woman for the first time, he becomes obsessed with capturing her essence in a perfume, but to do this, he must kill her.  She is but the first of many young women who will be used to create a scent of perfect beauty, innocence, and even love.In the beginning, the ugliness and brutality of slum life were so realistic I often had to look away.  In contrast, the second half is set in a beautiful countryside amid luxurious surroundings.  The photography and set designs are excellent as are the period costumes.  Whishaw gives an intense performance as the asocial, amoral anti-hero, an unlikable but fascinating character.  Dustin Hoffman is miscast as an Italian perfume maker.  His American accent and deadpan delivery are laughable and out of place.  Alan Rickman is very good in the small role of a nobleman.The story of a serial killer's desire to capture unattainable essences is engrossing, with final scenes involving 750 naked extras that are quite bizarre.

I can believe he saw it as a metaphor for celebrity in our time. Yet the orgy and everything that followed it struck me as false. I wasn't squeamish about the bodies, though I did start wondering about the folks involved with the shooting, but it seemed to me that it was also related to the concept that the genius can break all of the rules and somehow that is excusable. The Producer says that the film is supposed to be amoral, that is without a moral compass. So in the end the overwhelming shared erotic experience somehow excuses the 13 plus girls who had to die to make this divine scent, in other words the film really winks at human sacrifice, implying that when it comes to our sexual desires nothing is more important. (This interpretation is underscored by Alan Rickman's character asking for forgivenees.)I know the whole thing is a fable, yet it certainly does have a moral bearing: The truly gifted person is not understood and is thus excused for treating their fellow human beings execrably, if they can produce something miraculous. I would have accepted the orgy scene if they had gone all the way and ripped each other to shreds or done what ""his people"" do at the end, rip him to shreds and eat him.

1047771,A1V1DI17ZJRUPM,B000MMN6YS,Lady_C,"[1, 1]","The story setting is in the 18th century France yet the exact year did not mention in details. I assume it is in the late 18th century. (After the demise of Louis XV, France, on the verge of science revolution while bearing the King's luxurious Rococo deep debt, lived in a contradictory world (Rich & poor, chaos & order, Sir & servants, genius & freak, and blessing & curse.))Grenouille, born in a stench of filthy market, has a gifted nose. Yet, his life is not so blessed with love that he was immediately abandoned by his mother. Year by year, he was obsessed with olfactory excitements, and his uniqueness naturally draws a line between he and the ordinaries. The devoid of his social incompetence is also a barrier to connect the humanity, and ironically such barrier seems common among genius or freaks?!He was sold as a slave working in a tannery. One day, his foray to a city introduces his nostril to numerous enchanting smells with his eyes open, hunting the scent. Soon, it leads to a tragedy to his first victim, a red-haired virgin (red symbolizes passion and love in drama), and the others. Knowing being a perfumer would be able to preserve scents makes Grenouille's heart speeds up. He proves himself to recreate and to concoct the fragrance when opportunity favors him at Giuseppe Baldini's (Dustin Hoffman).O~ A lung full of bliss, le parfum, imbues one's soul. Baldini is amazed by his power, and exploits him in exchanging sublime perfume formulae. (In 18th-century France, perfume is an opulent merchandise and brings a lucrative business.)True beauty that lies within and radiates through body aura is what Grenouille seeks for his perfect perfume. Each woman he captured has a unique quality. He made a perfect perfume by using the essence of the women. Eventually, he was caught and yet escaped from headman's axe with his pheromonic perfect perfume which impulses men and women to perform a big orgy.He could have used his perfect perfume to preserve his own olfactory fiefdom, but it would be a hollow victory for there's no love/soul left to him. How much he wishes he could be loved and be recognized. Without it, he has nothing to live for; at the end, he melts himself with his perfect perfume into those 12 women's destiny.Grenouille, theatrically, wears no scent as if a stray ghost that doesn't exist nor is identified. The movie director reveals this secret in the middle of the movie, to which makes the protagonist not been immediately labeled as a freak as in the novel. The director would like his audiences to, imperceptibly, learn him better.In a literary perspective, it is inexplicable to say Grenouille is a real murderer/killer because he doesn't really enjoy killing. Rather, his motive is using his inhumanly focus on scent, the sole meaning of himself, to preserve 12 virgins' pristine state. (A metaphor, a message of what he longs for.)His character is more implicit than explicit. A metaphor which carries different meanings to different people. His character can be viewed as a message, a representative of one particular aspect of the feeling of love. Often mistaken for love itself, the hunger, the desperation, and the uncontrollable urge to surrender oneself is the most magical, as well as the most dangerous display among all symptoms of love. However, it is much like the composition of a cuisine dish: it can never have just one ingredient. Love needs a balance. Love encompasses understanding, compassion and a great level of tenderness.This movie reveals the contradiction between extreme and balance. It's the extreme that drives everything forward (and backward sometimes) but without balance, even something as beautiful as love can turn into disasters.The perfume, same idea as clothing, and sometimes fake characters, once you get hooked...it might backfire on you.",5,The secret behind the perfume,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,3833,"['story', 'setting', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'yet', 'exact', 'year', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'details', 'assume', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'demise', 'Louis', 'XV', 'France', 'verge', 'science', 'revolution', 'bearing', 'King', 'luxurious', 'Rococo', 'deep', 'debt', 'lived', 'contradictory', 'world', 'Rich', 'poor', 'chaos', 'order', 'Sir', 'servants', 'genius', 'freak', 'blessing', 'curse', 'Grenouille', 'born', 'stench', 'filthy', 'market', 'gifted', 'nose', 'life', 'not', 'so', 'blessed', 'love', 'was', 'immediately', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'Year', 'year', 'was', 'obsessed', 'olfactory', 'excitements', 'uniqueness', 'naturally', 'line', 'ordinaries', 'devoid', 'social', 'incompetence', 'also', 'barrier', 'connect', 'humanity', 'ironically', 'such', 'barrier', 'common', 'genius', 'freaks', 'was', 'sold', 'slave', 'working', 'tannery', 'One', 'day', 'foray', 'city', 'nostril', 'numerous', 'enchanting', 'smells', 'eyes', 'open', 'hunting', 'scent', 'Soon', 'tragedy', 'first', 'victim', 'red-haired', 'virgin', 'red', 'passion', 'love', 'drama', 'others', 'Knowing', 'being', 'perfumer', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'preserve', 'scents', 'Grenouille', 'heart', 'up', 'recreate', 'concoct', 'fragrance', 'when', 'opportunity', 'Giuseppe', 'Baldini', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', '.O~', 'lung', 'full', 'bliss', 'le', 'parfum', 'one', 'soul', 'Baldini', 'amazed', 'power', 'exchanging', 'sublime', 'perfume', 'formulae', '18th-century', 'France', 'perfume', 'opulent', 'merchandise', 'lucrative', 'business', 'True', 'beauty', 'body', 'aura', 'what', 'Grenouille', 'perfect', 'perfume', 'woman', 'captured', 'unique', 'quality', 'made', 'perfect', 'perfume', 'using', 'essence', 'women', 'Eventually', 'was', 'caught', 'yet', 'escaped', 'headman', 'axe', 'pheromonic', 'perfect', 'perfume', 'men', 'women', 'perform', 'big', 'orgy.He', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'perfect', 'perfume', 'preserve', 'own', 'olfactory', 'fiefdom', 'would', 'be', 'hollow', 'victory', 'love/soul', 'left', 'How', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'loved', 'be', 'recognized', 'nothing', 'live', 'end', 'melts', 'perfect', 'perfume', '12', 'women', 'destiny.Grenouille', 'theatrically', 'scent', 'stray', 'ghost', ""n't"", 'exist', 'identified', 'movie', 'director', 'secret', 'middle', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'not', 'been', 'immediately', 'labeled', 'freak', 'novel', 'director', 'would', 'like', 'audiences', 'imperceptibly', 'learn', 'better.In', 'literary', 'perspective', 'inexplicable', 'say', 'Grenouille', 'real', 'murderer/killer', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'killing', 'motive', 'using', 'inhumanly', 'focus', 'scent', 'sole', 'meaning', 'preserve', '12', 'virgins', 'pristine', 'state', 'metaphor', 'message', 'what', 'character', 'more', 'implicit', 'explicit', 'metaphor', 'different', 'meanings', 'different', 'people', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'message', 'representative', 'one', 'particular', 'aspect', 'feeling', 'love', 'Often', 'love', 'hunger', 'desperation', 'uncontrollable', 'urge', 'surrender', 'most', 'magical', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'dangerous', 'display', 'symptoms', 'love', 'However', 'much', 'composition', 'cuisine', 'dish', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'ingredient', 'Love', 'balance', 'Love', 'encompasses', 'understanding', 'compassion', 'great', 'level', 'tenderness.This', 'movie', 'contradiction', 'extreme', 'balance', 'extreme', 'everything', 'forward', 'backward', 'sometimes', 'balance', 'even', 'something', 'as', 'beautiful', 'love', 'can', 'turn', 'disasters.The', 'perfume', 'same', 'idea', 'clothing', 'sometimes', 'fake', 'characters', 'once', 'get', 'hooked', 'might', 'backfire']",N/A

1047774,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000MMN6YS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" is one of those films that begins pretty much at the start of the end.  Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is beaten and dragged from his prison cell to hear the sentence of the court, which seems to have a viciousness usually reserved for regicides.  This beginning makes it clear that the murderer whose story this is will be caught.  Such a statement is true, but it is also inaccurate when it comes to capturing the nature of this 2006 film directed by Tom Tykwer (""Heaven"") based on thenovelby Patrick S&uuml;skind.  Ultimately, I found myself thinking that this story is a fable.The history of perfume begins in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, with the name of a perfume maker appearing on a second millennium cuneiform tablet.  In the 18th century France became the center of the European perfume trade when aromatic plants grown in the Grasse region provided the raw materials for the flourishing industry.  However, S&uuml;skind's novel finds the motivation for perfume in the muck and mire that was the streets of Paris three centuries ago and even without the use of scratch-and-sniff stickers Tykwer's movie gives a sense that the city is one giant cesspool where perfumes are a necessary way of covering the smells.  Grenouille is literally born in the muck and manages to survive, growing up to evince two remarkable traits: Not only does he posses the most acute sense of smell on the planet but also has absolutely no scent of his own.Grenouille's unique talent leads to a peculiar obsession when he encounters two people.  One is a girl (Karoline Herfurth) who sells plums on those streets of Paris and the other is Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a master perfumer who has fallen out of favor and now resorts to trying to copy the successful perfumes of his competitors.  Grenouille wants to preserve the smell of the plum girl and it is in the service of that obsession that he becomes a murderer.  Baldini agrees to mentor the young tanner in exchange for marvelous new perfumes, but the old master does not have the secret that drives Grenouille and in parting Baldini tells the young man to head to Grasse, the center of the world for the art of perfuming.  However, once there what catches Grenouille's attention are not the plants of the region but the young women of Grasse, especially the beautiful Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood), daughter of Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman), a wealthy and well-respected citizen of the town.John Hurt's narration is a major part of the film since Grenouille is a man of very few words who spends most of his time sniffing the air and inhaling deeply the scents that catch his attention.  The narration is also needed to ensure the audience catches the attendant ironies of the story's conclusion.  It is Hurt's tone as much as his words that confirm my idea that this story is a fable.

The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his life dream of creating the perfect perfume, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), conditions leading to the French Revolution (1789).The movie portrays superbly life in France, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.We get a feel for the power and influence that the Catholic Church exerts during this time.The film is also excellent in showing the Ancien Regime's methods of execution (Hanging and ""The Cross"") as opposed to the ""revolutionary"" guillotine used after 1789.Ben Whishaw, Dustin Hoffman, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.

But in the overall scheme of things, those discomfiting sights are necessary to give you a sense of the supernormal sense of smell that the protagonist, Jean-Baptist Grenouille possesses.From the moment of his unfortunate birth under a fishmonger's table this is a tale of the full spectrum of scents, from horrid to euphoric.  Ben Whishaw plays the role of a boy abused by his world, who grows into a talented perfumer that pursues a horrific quest for the perfect scent.  Make no mistake, he's a monster, but his story is far more compelling than that you'll find in any Saw-like slasher porn.  This is a man capable of tracking a scent to it's source even through a squalid city.As a quasi-slave working in a tannery, Grenouille discovers his passion when he encounters Guiseppe Baldini, a master perfumer past his prime deftly played by Dustin Hoffman.  He demonstrates his innate ability by duplicating a scent for Baldini simply by finding the various components and deftly mixing them to perfection.  Baldini quickly realizes that his new apprentice is capable of returning his shoppe to the limelight and undertakes to educate him in the craft of perfuming, and Grenouille's obsession (no pun intended here at all) grows into sociopathic proportions.After learning what Baldini can teach him, he moves on to the city of Grasse, famed for it's method of enfleurage perfuming, where he learns more and his gruesome quest accelerates.  He decides that the way to create the perfect perfume is to capture the essence of 13 beautiful women.  When his first attempt with a prostitute encounters a little difficulty (she's more than creeped out at his style) he resolves that his victims must be killed first, in a manner that does not overly alarm them (think ambush from the back).Whishaw is capable in the lead role, however the movie is raised a notch by the performances of Hoffman and a few others.  Rachel Hurd-Wood is luminescent as his final target, easily giving you the impression that she possesses an essence of rare power (okay, that's a little over the top, but the whole theme is a little beyond the realm anyway).  And Alan Rickman is as solid as he always is as her protective father, a man capable of CSI-like analysis.  Finally, John Hurt lends his voice to that of the narrator, an often overlooked role that all too often gets in the way of a story but here it's necessary.It's gruesome in the extreme, and there is a fair amount of nudity (much of it post-mortem), but the story is absorbing beyond what your delicate sensibilities might suspect.",4,Thank goodness it's not in Smell-o-Vision!,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,2756,"['tough', 'get', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Perfume', 'Story', 'Murderer', 'given', 'images', 'seamy', 'side', '18th', 'century', 'Paris', 'denizens', 'human', 'animal', 'insect', 'overall', 'scheme', 'things', 'discomfiting', 'sights', 'are', 'necessary', 'give', 'sense', 'supernormal', 'sense', 'smell', 'protagonist', 'Jean-Baptist', 'Grenouille', 'moment', 'unfortunate', 'birth', 'fishmonger', 'table', 'tale', 'full', 'spectrum', 'scents', 'horrid', 'euphoric', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'role', 'boy', 'abused', 'world', 'who', 'talented', 'perfumer', 'horrific', 'quest', 'perfect', 'scent', 'Make', 'mistake', 'monster', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Saw-like', 'slasher', 'porn', 'man', 'capable', 'tracking', 'scent', 'source', 'even', 'squalid', 'city.As', 'quasi-slave', 'working', 'tannery', 'Grenouille', 'passion', 'when', 'Guiseppe', 'Baldini', 'master', 'perfumer', 'prime', 'deftly', 'played', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'innate', 'ability', 'duplicating', 'scent', 'Baldini', 'simply', 'finding', 'various', 'components', 'deftly', 'mixing', 'perfection', 'Baldini', 'quickly', 'new', 'apprentice', 'capable', 'returning', 'shoppe', 'limelight', 'undertakes', 'educate', 'craft', 'perfuming', 'Grenouille', 'obsession', 'pun', 'intended', 'here', 'sociopathic', 'proportions.After', 'learning', 'what', 'Baldini', 'can', 'teach', 'city', 'Grasse', 'famed', 'method', 'enfleurage', 'perfuming', 'where', 'more', 'gruesome', 'quest', 'accelerates', 'way', 'create', 'perfect', 'perfume', 'capture', 'essence', '13', 'beautiful', 'women', 'When', 'first', 'attempt', 'prostitute', 'little', 'difficulty', 'more', 'creeped', 'out', 'style', 'victims', 'must', 'be', 'killed', 'first', 'manner', 'not', 'overly', 'alarm', 'think', 'ambush', 'back', '.Whishaw', 'capable', 'lead', 'role', 'however', 'movie', 'raised', 'notch', 'performances', 'Hoffman', 'few', 'others', 'Rachel', 'Hurd-Wood', 'luminescent', 'final', 'target', 'easily', 'giving', 'impression', 'essence', 'rare', 'power', 'okay', 'little', 'top', 'whole', 'theme', 'little', 'realm', 'anyway', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'as', 'solid', 'always', 'protective', 'father', 'man', 'capable', 'CSI-like', 'analysis', 'Finally', 'John', 'Hurt', 'voice', 'narrator', 'often', 'overlooked', 'role', 'too', 'often', 'way', 'story', 'here', 'necessary.It', 'gruesome', 'extreme', 'fair', 'amount', 'nudity', 'much', 'post-mortem', 'story', 'absorbing', 'what', 'delicate', 'sensibilities', 'might', 'suspect']",N/A

To begin, there is very little dialogue. Instead the majority of the film is expressed visually and physically.  There is a narrator who gives insight into the main character's thoughts.  Visually it is unique. Often beautiful, sometimes disgusting, always magnificent.  The story spans the genres of drama, horror, suspense, fantasy, and period film. It's kind of like a twisted fairy tale. I gave it four stars because I think the ending seems slapped together, like the filmakers were trying desperatley to give our madman main character some redeeming quality at the last minute.  Up until that point, he is a creepy, obsessed, and insane serial killer with a one-track mind, and there is nothing in the movie to make you feel differently. Then in the last five minutes they throw this ""He did it all for love"" twist at you, but it's too little, too late. The BIG orgy scene is done in a way that is not profane, and in the end it has meaning and purpose. The scene is really about love and connection, not so much about sex, which helps you get over any strange feeling about watching it.  All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind and likes to escape to a different world.

After years of suffering abuse in a harsh orphanage and being forced into slave labour as a young adult, the question of whether criminals are born or nurtured begs to be asked.While the film reveals early on that this boy is ""gifted"" with a superior sense of smell, leading to olfactory obsession, it is wrong to assume that this automatically leads to criminal (murderous) proclivities. The film is thankfully vague about this.In this way the film, like all true art, does not beat you over the head with easy answers, nor does it pontificate an agenda, rather it lets you witness events as the proverbial fly on the wall, and encourages you to ponder whether criminals are born or nurtured by and EXTREMELY harsh and unforgiving society.Despite his crimes, I felt that given his past, I am more empathetic to criminals and may be less prone to judge.  For me, good films challenge my world-view, great films challenge my morals.  This one does both.Although this is not a ""popcorn"" film, or something that you would automatically sit down to watch with your family, it is powerful and provocative nontheless.  Despite its bizaare perfume-fetish-theme, it is socially relevant.  It is unfair to say the film is poor because it makes you feel depressed or horrified.  Not all films are meant to serve that purpose. Some films are meant to entertain, amuse or alternatively to challenge and provoke.Although it is possible that some scenes could have been shortened, I never found myself bored but rather felt myself mesmerized by the powerful images.",4,The making of a Psychopath - nature vs. nurture.,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,1937,"['being', 'jaded', 'thousands', 'scenes', 'violence', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'now', 'nothing', 'can', 'prepare', 'heartbreaking', 'opening', 'scene', 'poor', 'fellow', 'movie', 'antihero', 'being', 'born', 'abandoned', 'filthy', 'Paris', 'street', 'pile', 'fish', 'remains.From', 'moment', 'are', 'aware', 'human', 'being', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'average', 'person', 'years', 'suffering', 'abuse', 'harsh', 'orphanage', 'being', 'forced', 'slave', 'labour', 'young', 'adult', 'question', 'criminals', 'are', 'born', 'nurtured', 'begs', 'be', 'film', 'reveals', 'early', 'boy', 'gifted', 'superior', 'sense', 'smell', 'leading', 'olfactory', 'obsession', 'wrong', 'assume', 'automatically', 'criminal', 'murderous', 'proclivities', 'film', 'thankfully', 'vague', 'this.In', 'way', 'film', 'true', 'art', 'not', 'beat', 'head', 'easy', 'answers', 'pontificate', 'agenda', 'rather', 'witness', 'events', 'proverbial', 'fly', 'wall', 'ponder', 'criminals', 'are', 'born', 'nurtured', 'EXTREMELY', 'harsh', 'unforgiving', 'society.Despite', 'crimes', 'felt', 'given', 'past', 'am', 'more', 'empathetic', 'criminals', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'prone', 'judge', 'good', 'films', 'challenge', 'world-view', 'great', 'films', 'challenge', 'morals', 'one', 'not', 'popcorn', 'film', 'something', 'would', 'automatically', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'family', 'powerful', 'provocative', 'nontheless', 'bizaare', 'perfume-fetish-theme', 'socially', 'relevant', 'unfair', 'say', 'film', 'poor', 'feel', 'depressed', 'horrified', 'Not', 'films', 'are', 'meant', 'serve', 'purpose', 'films', 'are', 'meant', 'entertain', 'amuse', 'alternatively', 'challenge', 'possible', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', 'never', 'found', 'bored', 'rather', 'felt', 'mesmerized', 'powerful', 'images']",N/A

Set in post-Napoleanic France, the story follows the tragic life of a man, Jean, from birth to death, and how his scent of smell leads him to do ghoulish deeds.  You see, Jean has the world's most acute sense of smell, both in terms of sensitiveness, and ability to distinguish two smells that are almost identical.  Growing up in an orphanage, his ability sets him apart from the others.  He finally escapes and discovers the smell of women; specifically attractive virgin women.  This sets him on his goal of creating the perfect perfume, one made out of the scent of virgin women.How does one classify this movie?  It has scenes of suspense, but these are few and far between.  There is comedy, but it is black comedy that is grim.  There is murder, but no blood or gore of any sort.  And there are numerous scenes of attractive, naked women; but our protagonist only rubs their smells from their bodies without ever taking advantage of them.  It is best classified as a drama; one meant for adults only.  The story is very original, probably the most original story of any film released in 2006, even though it is based on a book.  The two main supporting actors are the only famous names in the cast; Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman.  Everyone else, including the numerous beautiful women are Hollywood unknowns.

He was able to smell things that very few of us can.But he was so obsessed with capturing smells, that he killed so that he could hold on to that smell. This is sick enough, but the end was so upsetting and so strange, that it made me sick myself. The movie is a very dark physoligical thriller, which is why I found this part to be especially odd.It seems that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille created a perfume that was so captivating, so hypnotic that people that smelled it were put under some sort of spell.In the one scene is question, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille unveils his new perfume. The entire crowd of a few hundred take off their clothes and engage is a huge orgy.Now if this were a comedy, perhaps I could except it. But this, is a serious dark thriller. I dont get it.

It grabs the viewer from the first moment when a baby is apparently stillborn under the table of a fishmonger's stall amidst garbage and fish innards, in one of the slimiest parts of Paris. But the baby fights to live and live he does despite his desperate beginning and childhood.Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is shunned by everyone: his social interactions are abnormal and he cannot relate emotionally with anyone, except to protect himself.  However, he does possess an extraordinary skill: his sense of smell.  He can smell things that other humans do not believe have any smell at all, e.g. glass, copper, stone etc. His goal in life becomes how to capture the essence of smells, particularly those of the human soul.This quest leads him to develop methods of preserving human essences, but in order to retrieve them, he has to kill the people whose essences he desires.  They are all beautiful young women.The story starts as a ""true"" tale told in flashback and  it seems totally believable, even though it is fiction.  The filmmakers also generate an atmosphere that makes you think you smell what he is smelling too--an amazing feat.This is an exceptional film, not quite like anything else I have ever seen, except perhaps ""Sweeny Todd"".

He is deprived in every way except in his ability to experience pleasure in cataloguing smells of the world around him.  Ben Whishaw is fantastic in portraying this character with all his depravity for motherly love, decent upbringing and childhood, desire to survive harsh life at any costs while bringing misfortune to all his encounters along the way - starting with his own mother from the day of his birth, perfume master who teaches him a trade and yound women, whose ethernal essence his tries so desperately to preserve.  Is this story about the man with a special gift, or a story of love that is destructive in all its beauty; is it a story of one's purpose and all the emotional numbness that comes from need to experience love and obtain one's own essence in this world- no matter what the cost?  The character of this movie is so intense, in his own way - he is greater than life itself in spite of the fact that the only way he can express himself is thru creation of the ethernal (love) perfume that disarms all around him.  This poor soul is not seeking riches, or fame, or power -- all he wants is to experience love and beauty he has never had.

1047813,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000MMN6YS,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[14, 41]","Perfume""Perfume"" tells the tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a Parisian baby born to a rather stupid mother, who, assuming him to be yet another stillbirth, literally tosses him into the gutter. He's hired by a tannery and eventually, when a down-on-his-luck perfume maker Giuseppe Baldini notices his incredible gift for scent, Grenouille sets about achieving greatness in his own peculiar manner.The biggest problem with ""Perfume"" is that it suffers from the ultimate case of The Emperor's New Nose. There's an imperceptible line of demarcation, much like the two mountain paths recurring in the movie, that divides brilliance from dreck, and sadly, ""Perfume"" hitches its wagon to the latter path, and follows it through to the bitter end.Performance-wise there's nothing going on we haven't seen before, the nearest thing to honest-to-god acting contained in this movie is Alan Rickman's performance as Antoine Richis, troubled father of the beautiful Laura. Sadly, his part is a very small one (as are all parts of this movie not that of its lead character) and his ridiculously over-the-top speech in the closing minutes of the picture negate any sense of affinity or empathy we might have felt for him. Something about how he's going to seep into Grenouille's pores and come shooting out his nose, or something. I'm not making this up.As troubled teen Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, Ben Whishaw is a total nonstarter: he's sort of a cross between Beaker from the Muppet Show and a comatose Hannibal Lecter. His emotional range doesn't stretch past looking either A. bored, or B. slightly turned-on. But then, the screenplay must assume its fair share of the blame: Whishaw does for the most part what he can with a really turgid script. It seems someone forgot to explain to the director and screenplay writing team that this, in fact, is a talkie.The biggest problem with ""Perfume"" is the disparity between what the overly-explicit visuals would have you believe, and what the screenplay actually tells us. Smellovision hasn't yet been invented so clearly the production design and the camerawork are designed to make us believe that we can indeed smell the many strong odours of Grenouille's Paris. It's going for a sense of lushness and full-on olfactory assault. The screenplay gives us a monotonous one-note Tale O' Woe, and it's in this glaring contrast that the essence of what could have been a stellar piece of cinema is totally and irretrievably lost.

The ending is a perfect conclusion to a ""Brothers Grimm Fairy Tale"" of one's need to exist and have self worth.

His fishmonger mother squirted him out like the four stillborn babes before him.  When she believed him dead, she left him to be tossed with the day's guts.  His cry saved him--and damned his mother to the gallows.From there, the baby went to an orphanage, raised just old enough to be sold as a servant to a tannery.  A trip to town taught him there was more to smell than just dead animal hides.His sense of smell brings him to the attention of once famous perfumier, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) who teaches him everything he knows--until his protege tries to cook down the cat to gain its essence.From there, he continues in search of the perfect scent and discovers the best way to obtain a truly divine perfume--which happens to be rendered from the rendered fat of women he killed.""Perfume"" details the killer's process of 'discovering' his perfect perfume.  As one might expect, the dehumanization of of Grenouille's own life gave him no concept of any other--animal or human. His progress from animal killer to human serial killer is grisly, shocking, and far too realistic.Cinematography was excellent. Whishaw, Hoffman, and Alan Rickman as Richis, a local nobel desperately seeking the man who killed his daughter, were all convincing.

1047816,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B000MMN6YS,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[4, 5]","I liked the movie.I appreciate the rather uniform high quality of the amazon reviews, it tells me that the movie stimulates people to think about the issues and consider what the authors present.But i'm left with several lingering problems about what was going on.Perhaps these things were settled in the novel and only hinted at in the movie, i don't know.Like any good piece of literature there are several threads interwoven.The first is about obsession and talent. Here the movie reminds of Amadeus, just a different sense-this with smell and Amadeus with sound.For Amadeus was about talent, like this movie what happens when talent is submerged in life and suppressed and not recognized for the rarity and genius that it is.The main character, Frog (apparently one translation of his name and a striking description of the character and his walk as well), never has a chance. Despite being an olafactory genius, he is trapped in a time and place that only offers his talent meager usage. That is one of the questions i had, this main theme just gets dropped after the climax of the naked bodies in the square, he literally loses the obsession and the drive, i don't know why.As his uniquely talented nose is discovering the world and trying to find an outlet (which it eventually does with Dustin Hoffman's character, the failed Italian perfumer). The second theme begins to emerge, on top of the obsession is something about the essential things, the essence of being, the smell that characterizes. At first it looks like the author is talking about the soul, the thing that makes a woman a woman, a piece of steel-steel etc. but i am not sure. It looks as if this characteristic, this smell that he detects is the essence of being a woman, maybe love, maybe joy in living, maybe even pheromones of attraction and sensual passion. This is the whole thread about creating the perfect perfume from the distilled essence of the 12 (or is it 13?) beautiful, attractive, young women. It doesn't appear to be about sex, despite the orgy at the end where the townsfolk get a whiff of the finished product. Perhaps there is a hint in the three kinds of scents used in perfumes, one for immediate, one for intermediate, one for long term. In the long term, the townspeople were apparently embarrassed and ashamed, in the short term they were passionate and lustful. In any case, the perfume is about synergy, how the essence of these women together create the perfect perfume.Another major theme is about love and caring. The first half basically hasn't any love in it at all, the later half has the relationship of the father and daughter and them to the dead but not forgotten mother and wife. The Frog has no love or concern for anyone, his first murder is just circumstantial, an accident.The others are planned, calculating and cold blooded, none even with any passion or lust despite the hair shorn and naked bodies of the young victims. His only passion comes in a brief, what if vision he sees when he opens and uses the perfume in the town square. It's not as much regret for their deaths as a missed opportunity to smell them more intimately. But another thing that puzzles me is that the universe, that fate seems to follow him and tidy things up, everyone that passes him along, from birth mother, to orphanage exploiter, to perfumer, to 2nd perfumer, died comically tragic deaths soon after he moves on. It is as if the universe is balancing out the very rotten hand he was dealt, by dealing death to those that exploit him. But why? Because they didn't recognize and further the talented nose? No, it is more like cleaning house or tying up lose ends. Again, i'm not sure what the author is trying to tell us here.Even with these 3 themes doing a complex waltz on screen, the movie is a riot of color and proposed smells for us, the audience. Since our theaters don't have aerosols that bring specific smells to our minds, the smells are provoked by some extraordinarily good movie making. I for one can smell the sewers of later 16 or early 16thC Paris, i've been in Chinese fish markets and suspect that they smelled pretty much how the world into which he was thrust so unceremoniously did back then. This crossover of visual and olfactory senses is a treat, movies seldom work much on our sense of smell. Again the alignment with Amadeus pops up, just another sense. There is this nice crossover between sense and sensually, for smell is a key sense in sex and lust, something that the movie uses to heighten and strength the impact.It's an interesting movie, i'm glad i ran across it.",5,"SMELL: sense and sensuality, essence and soul",1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,4600,"['liked', 'movie.I', 'appreciate', 'rather', 'uniform', 'high', 'quality', 'amazon', 'reviews', 'movie', 'people', 'think', 'issues', 'consider', 'what', 'authors', 'present.But', 'i', ""'m"", 'left', 'several', 'lingering', 'problems', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'things', 'were', 'settled', 'novel', 'only', 'hinted', 'movie', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Like', 'good', 'piece', 'literature', 'are', 'several', 'threads', 'interwoven.The', 'first', 'obsession', 'talent', 'Here', 'movie', 'Amadeus', 'just', 'different', 'sense-this', 'smell', 'Amadeus', 'sound.For', 'Amadeus', 'was', 'talent', 'movie', 'what', 'when', 'talent', 'submerged', 'life', 'suppressed', 'not', 'recognized', 'rarity', 'genius', 'main', 'character', 'Frog', 'apparently', 'one', 'translation', 'name', 'striking', 'description', 'character', 'walk', 'well', 'never', 'chance', 'being', 'olafactory', 'genius', 'trapped', 'time', 'place', 'only', 'talent', 'meager', 'usage', 'one', 'questions', 'i', 'had', 'main', 'theme', 'just', 'dropped', 'climax', 'naked', 'bodies', 'square', 'literally', 'obsession', 'drive', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why.As', 'uniquely', 'talented', 'nose', 'discovering', 'world', 'trying', 'find', 'outlet', 'eventually', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'failed', 'Italian', 'perfumer', 'second', 'theme', 'emerge', 'top', 'obsession', 'something', 'essential', 'things', 'essence', 'being', 'smell', 'first', 'author', 'talking', 'soul', 'thing', 'woman', 'woman', 'piece', 'steel-steel', 'etc', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'characteristic', 'smell', 'essence', 'being', 'woman', 'maybe', 'love', 'maybe', 'joy', 'living', 'maybe', 'even', 'pheromones', 'attraction', 'sensual', 'passion', 'whole', 'thread', 'creating', 'perfect', 'perfume', 'distilled', 'essence', '12', '13', 'beautiful', 'attractive', 'young', 'women', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'sex', 'orgy', 'end', 'where', 'townsfolk', 'get', 'whiff', 'finished', 'product', 'Perhaps', 'hint', 'three', 'kinds', 'scents', 'used', 'perfumes', 'one', 'immediate', 'one', 'intermediate', 'one', 'long', 'term', 'long', 'term', 'townspeople', 'were', 'apparently', 'embarrassed', 'ashamed', 'short', 'term', 'were', 'passionate', 'lustful', 'case', 'perfume', 'synergy', 'how', 'essence', 'women', 'together', 'create', 'perfect', 'perfume.Another', 'major', 'theme', 'love', 'caring', 'first', 'half', 'basically', ""n't"", 'love', 'later', 'half', 'relationship', 'father', 'daughter', 'dead', 'not', 'forgotten', 'mother', 'wife', 'Frog', 'love', 'concern', 'anyone', 'first', 'murder', 'just', 'circumstantial', 'accident.The', 'others', 'are', 'planned', 'calculating', 'cold', 'blooded', 'none', 'even', 'passion', 'lust', 'hair', 'shorn', 'naked', 'bodies', 'young', 'victims', 'only', 'passion', 'brief', 'what', 'vision', 'when', 'perfume', 'town', 'square', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'regret', 'deaths', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'smell', 'more', 'intimately', 'thing', 'universe', 'fate', 'follow', 'tidy', 'things', 'up', 'everyone', 'along', 'birth', 'mother', 'orphanage', 'exploiter', 'perfumer', '2nd', 'perfumer', 'died', 'comically', 'tragic', 'deaths', 'soon', 'universe', 'balancing', 'out', 'very', 'rotten', 'hand', 'was', 'dealt', 'dealing', 'death', 'exploit', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'further', 'talented', 'nose', 'No', 'more', 'cleaning', 'house', 'tying', 'up', 'lose', 'ends', 'Again', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'author', 'trying', 'tell', 'here.Even', '3', 'themes', 'doing', 'complex', 'waltz', 'screen', 'movie', 'riot', 'color', 'proposed', 'smells', 'audience', 'theaters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'aerosols', 'bring', 'specific', 'smells', 'minds', 'smells', 'are', 'provoked', 'extraordinarily', 'good', 'movie', 'making', 'one', 'can', 'smell', 'sewers', 'later', '16', 'early', '16thC', 'Paris', 'i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Chinese', 'fish', 'markets', 'suspect', 'smelled', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'world', 'was', 'thrust', 'so', 'unceremoniously', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'crossover', 'visual', 'olfactory', 'senses', 'treat', 'movies', 'seldom', 'work', 'much', 'sense', 'smell', 'Again', 'alignment', 'Amadeus', 'up', 'just', 'sense', 'nice', 'crossover', 'sense', 'sensually', 'smell', 'key', 'sense', 'sex', 'lust', 'something', 'movie', 'heighten', 'strength', 'impact.It', 'interesting', 'movie', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'ran']",N/A

I have to say that beware what you ask for! This is a morbid story to say the least, but it is one of the best productions that i have seen in quite a while.The story is about human survival against all odds and rewards (Whishaw) Jean Baptiste Grenouille (student perfumer) with an increadable gift of olfactory excellence/precision that is extremely rare. His gift comes with a price tag attached that will come back to haunt him late in the movie. J B could not of had a harder life since his birth and life in an orphanage where he is treated as an oddity to be feared. He is sold for a small fee to a tannery owner when he was not worth keeping and his space was needed for a younger child.His life wasn't any better at the tannery and he had only a five year life expectancy of hard labor. He finds his chance to pursue his quest to smell everything in the world and to preserve the scents for eternity when he delivers goat skins to a washed out perfumer (Baldini) played by Dustin Hoffman. Baldini is in need to copy the latest perfume that a rival is cashing in on, but his nose is failing him and he can't figure out all the ingredients needed to reproduce the fragrance. JB seizes this opportunity and makes a deal with Baldini and tells him he not only can copy it, but he will make it better in trade for Baldini teaching him the in's and out's and how to preserve the fragrances. Baldini buys JB from the tannery owner and they begin their student/teacher relationship with a few minor problems and this tutelage/job is the first time in JB's life that he is more or less happy. They share everything and JB makes Baldini a very happy and a even more prosperous man, but JB wants to learn more because he has a desire to capture this one fragrance that consumes every fiber of his being.He leaves Paris for the town where Baldini learnd how to be a master perfumer to hone his skills and to fulfill his deepest desire/quest to capture and preserve this ultimate fragrance. His life takes a few steps backwards at his new employer akin to the tannery, but not as bad and his gift allows him some freedom to pursue and master his techniques for extracting his essential oils.I have left out certain key elements to the story so I wouldn't spoil everything. I just wanted to give you a basic understanding of his life and his story. The last twenty or so minutes are pretty crazy and more than a little over the top and at this time he learns about an even more precious gift the gift of ??? .The acting, story/plot, direction, editing and cinematography are all top shelf and combined tell this provcative story in an unforgetable thought provoking way that I think will stay with me foe awhile.

1047822,A9LNWA25IM2DX,B000MMN6YS,"R.Suarez ""R-Suarez-""","[2, 3]","Director Tom Tykwer decided to take on a project many directors previously rejected for considering it `unfilmable', with `Run Lola run' as a reference he started to work on this project. The result? An excellent adaptation that makes the experience of watching this film feel almost like reading the book.Based on the novel by Patrick Suskind, `Perfume' tells the story of a singular character born with an enhanced sense of smell that enables him to identify and separate all smells he can detect. The character seems also to be cursed as everyone related to him ends up badly. When he gets obsessed with the smell of a virgin he then looks to learn how to capture the essence of things so he can obtain the smells he wants to create the ultimate perfume.The story in the movie is guided by a narrator (John Hurt) and has most of the story arcs from the novel; some details were removed but they aren't really to be missed, in the novel for example, Grenouille creates a perfume with the smell of human that is not shown in the film. From beginning to end the adaptation is incredibly accurate, but even though the ending is exactly the same as the one in the book (even the same lines), the ending didn't feel quite well to me in the movie, I remember it having a deeper effect on me when I read it.The style Tykwer uses to show the smell of things in interesting and in the same format of effects used in `Run Lola run', the music fits well with the movie as it uses haunting themes that complement the visuals to create a dark mood for the film.Other than a 30 minutes documentary of the making of the film, there are no special features. The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 and 2.0 surround and English/French/Spanish subtitles. The lack of extras really don't compensate for the price, you can get the movie for a cheaper price in the amazon market place instead. This detail explains the star I took from the review.If you read the novel you definitely want to see the film as the people involved in the making made a great job adapting it to the cinema. If you haven't you don't really need to read the novel first unless you'd like to compare details.",4,Almost like reading the book,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2188,"['Director', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'decided', 'take', 'project', 'many', 'directors', 'previously', 'rejected', 'considering', 'unfilmable', 'Run', 'Lola', 'run', 'reference', 'started', 'work', 'project', 'result', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'experience', 'watching', 'film', 'feel', 'almost', 'reading', 'book.Based', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'Suskind', 'Perfume', 'story', 'singular', 'character', 'born', 'enhanced', 'sense', 'smell', 'identify', 'separate', 'smells', 'can', 'detect', 'character', 'also', 'be', 'cursed', 'everyone', 'related', 'up', 'badly', 'When', 'obsessed', 'smell', 'virgin', 'then', 'learn', 'how', 'capture', 'essence', 'things', 'can', 'obtain', 'smells', 'create', 'ultimate', 'perfume.The', 'story', 'movie', 'guided', 'narrator', 'John', 'Hurt', 'most', 'story', 'arcs', 'novel', 'details', 'were', 'removed', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'missed', 'novel', 'example', 'Grenouille', 'perfume', 'smell', 'human', 'not', 'shown', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'adaptation', 'incredibly', 'accurate', 'even', 'ending', 'exactly', 'same', 'one', 'book', 'even', 'same', 'lines', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'well', 'movie', 'remember', 'having', 'deeper', 'effect', 'when', 'read', 'it.The', 'style', 'Tykwer', 'show', 'smell', 'things', 'interesting', 'same', 'format', 'effects', 'used', 'Run', 'Lola', 'run', 'music', 'well', 'movie', 'haunting', 'themes', 'complement', 'visuals', 'create', 'dark', 'mood', 'film.Other', '30', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'movie', 'presented', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Dolby', '5.1', '2.0', 'surround', 'English/French/Spanish', 'subtitles', 'lack', 'extras', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'compensate', 'price', 'can', 'get', 'movie', 'cheaper', 'price', 'amazon', 'market', 'place', 'instead', 'detail', 'star', 'took', 'review.If', 'read', 'novel', 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'made', 'great', 'job', 'adapting', 'cinema', 'have', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'read', 'novel', 'first', ""'d"", 'like', 'compare', 'details']",N/A

I read the novel, which is magnificent, and I had a tough time imagining how somebody could reflect Suskind's masterpiece on the screen, and make it justice. I am really glad I decided to go ahead and give it a try, since this is one of the best adaptations I have seen in my life, up to par withThe ShiningandTo Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition). The way in which the director, Tom Tykwer, used the camera to convey a world of olfactory sensations was simply brilliant.This is the story of the abominable Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, who was born in 1738 in a putrid fish market and who had to fight for his survival right from the start. Rejected by his mother, who left him to die, he ends up in an orphanage where he has to endure abuse from his peers. When he is old enough he is sold as a slave to a tannery, but his willpower kept him afloat. That was not his only strength though, since Grenouille had a marvelous gift: his supernatural sense of smell.While working at the tannery he discovers a couple of things that will change his life: a perfume shop, and even more relevant, a woman with a magnificent scent. The latter generates an urge that has to be satisfied, so Jean-Baptiste follows the girl and ends up smothering and killing her. The problem is that after death the scent disappears. So now he has to find a way to preserve the object of his obsession, and his journey begins with the perfumer Baldini (Dustin Hoffman). Baldini has had his era of glory but he has been eclipsed by the brilliance of his competitor Pelissier. Grenouille and his unnatural ability seem to be the answer to all his prayers, or maybe not.Part of the reason why the adaptation of this novel works so well is the amazing performance of Ben Whishaw, who convincingly portrays the perturbed and immoral Grenouille. Whishaw is able to give this character a combination of obsession with his quest and nonchalance regarding the actions needed to achieve his goals. These are the things that make the main character of this story so complex and mesmerizing in the book. The supporting cast does not lag far behind, with a Dustin Hoffman that plays his role accurately and efficiently, and a Alan Rickman that infuses his character with the necessary emotion and desperation to make it believable. I recommend this movie without reservations, and if you have not read the book I urge you to do that too, since both experiences are highly enjoyable.",5,"""This is no man, this is an angel""",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,2499,"['have', 'confess', 'was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'movie', 'read', 'novel', 'magnificent', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'imagining', 'how', 'somebody', 'could', 'reflect', 'Suskind', 'masterpiece', 'screen', 'make', 'justice', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'give', 'try', 'one', 'best', 'adaptations', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'up', 'par', 'withThe', 'ShiningandTo', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'way', 'director', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'used', 'camera', 'convey', 'world', 'olfactory', 'sensations', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant.This', 'story', 'abominable', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Grenouille', 'who', 'was', 'born', '1738', 'putrid', 'fish', 'market', 'who', 'had', 'fight', 'survival', 'right', 'start', 'Rejected', 'mother', 'who', 'left', 'die', 'up', 'orphanage', 'where', 'endure', 'abuse', 'peers', 'When', 'old', 'enough', 'sold', 'slave', 'tannery', 'willpower', 'kept', 'afloat', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'strength', 'Grenouille', 'had', 'marvelous', 'gift', 'supernatural', 'sense', 'smell.While', 'working', 'tannery', 'couple', 'things', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'perfume', 'shop', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'woman', 'magnificent', 'scent', 'latter', 'urge', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'girl', 'up', 'smothering', 'killing', 'problem', 'death', 'scent', 'So', 'now', 'find', 'way', 'preserve', 'object', 'obsession', 'journey', 'perfumer', 'Baldini', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Baldini', 'had', 'era', 'glory', 'been', 'eclipsed', 'brilliance', 'competitor', 'Pelissier', 'Grenouille', 'unnatural', 'ability', 'seem', 'be', 'answer', 'prayers', 'maybe', 'not.Part', 'reason', 'why', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'so', 'well', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'who', 'convincingly', 'perturbed', 'immoral', 'Grenouille', 'Whishaw', 'able', 'give', 'character', 'combination', 'obsession', 'quest', 'nonchalance', 'regarding', 'actions', 'needed', 'achieve', 'goals', 'are', 'things', 'make', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'so', 'complex', 'mesmerizing', 'book', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'lag', 'far', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'accurately', 'efficiently', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'character', 'necessary', 'emotion', 'desperation', 'make', 'believable', 'recommend', 'movie', 'reservations', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'urge', 'do', 'too', 'experiences', 'are', 'highly', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Obsessesed with the scent of a woman (pure innocence), he goes mad trying to learn how to preserve that very scent.With a narrator telling this slow drawn out tale, the viewer is quickly enamored by the ""Hannibal-like"" tone of this movie.  I know I was!  I enjoyed the long drawn out scenes of silence as the narrator weaves the tell of Jean-Baptiste and his quest in becoming a fine perfume maker.Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as the aging mentor!Those who love a mad thriller that builds you up with frightening anticipation will not be disappointed...that is...until the very end.  The gore is not too over the top.  The lead's obsessions with smells is a bit kinky, even funny at times, but totally understandable in the script.Let's talk about the ending...I won't spoil it for you here but I will tell you it's way over the top and just silly.  It doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the movie.  It's too supernatural like and totally unexpected given the events that have already taken place.Here's what should have happened and would have left this viewer a bit more satisfied...Jean-Baptiste should have been executed for his crimes.  Done!  Finished!  The lead dies!  He has to.  He's already been caught.  However, maybe a few days later his 13 bottles of oil samples are discovered by a child playing in the barn where Jean-Baptiste worked.  The child opens the 13th bottle and takes a whiff.  The camera comes in close on the child's nose and the nostrils inhaling, the same scene we are first treated to in the beginning of the movie.  It's enough to let us know, or at least let us think, this child posesses the same quality and maybe a new perfume maker (killer) will be born.  The End.For those who are fans of movies like Silence of the Lambs, From Hell, or any Jack the Ripper, old England-type scary movies, definitely don't miss out on this one.

Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[11, 15]","Scent of a Woman collides with Silence of the Lambs in this bizarre, beautiful and bittersweet story of a compulsive killer.A savant of smell, Parisian-born orphan Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) grows up in the 18th-century school of hard knocks, yet is determined to become the greatest perfumer the world has ever known. As he stalks the evanescent aroma of a beautiful young redhead (Karoline Herfurth), his obsession turns to tragedy, setting him of a life-path of death and destruction.Pros:A visual feast that almost magically conjures the scents onscreenA serial killer story steeped in a historically-heightened fairytale feelCons:A little too much foreshadowing makes the movie drag here and therePerfume is brilliantly cast, with great -- and sometimes delightfully over-the-top -- performances from silver screen stars like Dustin Hoffman (master perfumer), John Hurt (narrator), and Alan Rickman (the protective father of a would-be Grenouille victim). Ben Whishaw portrays a truly reprehensible, murderous character with no redeeming qualities, yet he imbues  Grenouille with a pitiable, sympathetic air reminiscent of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein.It's very well-directed (if somewhat a tad too leisurely) by Run Lola Run's Tom Tykwer, and wonderfully wrought by everyone else from the set-designer, to the composer, to the flower-finder.This is a difficult film to describe without spilling too many surprises, so all I can say is: take the time to stop smell the cinematic rose that is Perfume.Staci Layne Wilson",5,Smells Like Teen Spirit,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,1536,"['Scent', 'Woman', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'bizarre', 'beautiful', 'bittersweet', 'story', 'compulsive', 'killer.A', 'savant', 'smell', 'Parisian-born', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Grenouille', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'up', '18th-century', 'school', 'hard', 'knocks', 'determined', 'become', 'greatest', 'perfumer', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'evanescent', 'aroma', 'beautiful', 'young', 'redhead', 'Karoline', 'Herfurth', 'obsession', 'tragedy', 'setting', 'life-path', 'death', 'destruction.Pros', 'visual', 'feast', 'almost', 'magically', 'scents', 'onscreenA', 'serial', 'killer', 'story', 'steeped', 'historically-heightened', 'fairytale', 'feelCons', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'foreshadowing', 'movie', 'drag', 'here', 'therePerfume', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'great', 'sometimes', 'delightfully', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'silver', 'screen', 'stars', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'master', 'perfumer', 'John', 'Hurt', 'narrator', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'protective', 'father', 'would-be', 'Grenouille', 'victim', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'truly', 'reprehensible', 'murderous', 'character', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'yet', 'Grenouille', 'pitiable', 'sympathetic', 'air', 'reminiscent', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Frankenstein.It', 'very', 'well-directed', 'somewhat', 'tad', 'too', 'leisurely', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'wonderfully', 'wrought', 'everyone', 'else', 'set-designer', 'composer', 'flower-finder.This', 'difficult', 'film', 'describe', 'spilling', 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'can', 'say', 'take', 'time', 'stop', 'smell', 'cinematic', 'rose', 'Perfume.Staci', 'Layne', 'Wilson']",N/A

1047837,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000MMN6YS,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 5]","A meritorious overall design and an intriguing beginning are promptly buried by exceptionally unconventional twists and a laughably bizarre conclusion in Tom Tykwer's Perfume: The Story of a Murderer. With undertones of Silence of the Lambs, and a beautifully haunting score, we're unfortunately forced to root for Buffalo Bill. Based on the perceivably unfilmable bestselling novel by Patrick Suskind, the world of scents and smell appear visually delightful; however it fails to be wholly entertaining.In 18th century France, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born to a nauseating fishmonger who promptly disposes of him in a pile of rotting fish carcasses and writhing maggots. She earns the noose for her troubles, and Grenouille is sent to grow up in the orphanage where he discovers his astounding ability to discern every kind of smell. He is sold to a vile tanner, and during a fortunate delivery happens upon Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a d&eacute;class&eacute; perfumer who quickly buys Grenouille when he discovers his skills for deciphering the ingredients used in a rival's perfume. When a chance encounter with a young girl leads him to obsess over the unobtainable scent of womanhood, he ignites a killing spree of several women in the city of Grasse, using their bodies to create the elusive aroma. Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman) must protect his daughter, the most enticing woman in Grasse, whom he knows might be the final ingredient in Grenouille's relentless and unimaginable plan.Newcomer Ben Wishaw plays Grenouille with morbid yet enticing fervor, leading the viewer to anxiously wait for his next psychotic endeavor. Hoffman and Rickman also lend their acting expertise; Hoffman mainly for comic relief, and Rickman for much needed, stern normalcy. And normalcy is what Perfume so desperately lacked, as the twisted events abruptly spiraled to an unfathomable conclusion. So many pieces worked in favor of the film, but nothing could save it from its intangible plot. We follow the works of Grenouille much in the same way we root for the insidious Hannibal Lector, except that Perfume is unquestionably devoid of any Clarice Starling characters to which we can justifiably relate. As much as the film is visually stunning, the eccentricity is so overwhelming that by the unpredictable and sadly laughable conclusion, we're left with nothing to dwell on but those very atrocities. Culminating with a surprising display of sexual deviance, the magnificence and allure of the characters and settings are disbanded, resulting in disbelief and confusion. Crossing those boundaries of believability, even in a predominantly fantasy environment, and then subjecting audiences to little sense of retribution, leaves much to be desired from such an engrossing start. Curiously reminiscent of David Lynch, Shinya Tsukamoto and Alejandro Jodorowsky, director Tom Tykwer achieves few of their often satisfyingly macabre concoctions.Perhaps the only truly redeeming aspect of the film is the captivating score with a recurring melodic theme that permeates the oftentimes grisly look of the filthy cities portrayed. The major settings, first Paris where Jean-Baptiste is born, and then Grasse where he journeys to discover the secrets of preserving scents, are brilliantly recreated in all their dismal glory. Elaborate costumes and striking imagery are lavishly produced, and the abundance of highly aromatic items nearly burst from the screen.Fans of particularly deranged cinema might find this interesting fantasy palatable, but the majority of moviegoers will probably be paled by Perfume's deficient denouement and its lengthy two-and-a-half hour duration.- Mike Massie",3,Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie Review,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,3699,"['meritorious', 'overall', 'design', 'intriguing', 'beginning', 'are', 'promptly', 'buried', 'exceptionally', 'unconventional', 'twists', 'laughably', 'bizarre', 'conclusion', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'Perfume', 'Story', 'Murderer', 'undertones', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'score', ""'re"", 'unfortunately', 'forced', 'root', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Based', 'perceivably', 'unfilmable', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'Suskind', 'world', 'scents', 'smell', 'appear', 'visually', 'delightful', 'however', 'be', 'wholly', 'entertaining.In', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Grenouille', 'Ben', 'Wishaw', 'born', 'nauseating', 'fishmonger', 'who', 'promptly', 'pile', 'rotting', 'fish', 'carcasses', 'writhing', 'maggots', 'noose', 'troubles', 'Grenouille', 'sent', 'grow', 'up', 'orphanage', 'where', 'astounding', 'ability', 'discern', 'kind', 'smell', 'sold', 'vile', 'tanner', 'fortunate', 'delivery', 'Giuseppe', 'Baldini', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'd', 'eacute', 'class', 'eacute', 'perfumer', 'who', 'quickly', 'Grenouille', 'when', 'skills', 'deciphering', 'ingredients', 'used', 'rival', 'perfume', 'When', 'chance', 'encounter', 'young', 'girl', 'obsess', 'unobtainable', 'scent', 'womanhood', 'killing', 'spree', 'several', 'women', 'city', 'Grasse', 'using', 'bodies', 'create', 'elusive', 'aroma', 'Antoine', 'Richis', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'must', 'protect', 'daughter', 'most', 'enticing', 'woman', 'Grasse', 'whom', 'might', 'be', 'final', 'ingredient', 'Grenouille', 'relentless', 'unimaginable', 'plan.Newcomer', 'Ben', 'Wishaw', 'Grenouille', 'morbid', 'yet', 'enticing', 'fervor', 'leading', 'viewer', 'anxiously', 'wait', 'next', 'psychotic', 'endeavor', 'Hoffman', 'Rickman', 'also', 'lend', 'acting', 'expertise', 'Hoffman', 'mainly', 'comic', 'relief', 'Rickman', 'much', 'needed', 'stern', 'normalcy', 'normalcy', 'what', 'Perfume', 'so', 'desperately', 'lacked', 'twisted', 'events', 'abruptly', 'spiraled', 'unfathomable', 'conclusion', 'So', 'many', 'pieces', 'worked', 'favor', 'film', 'nothing', 'could', 'save', 'intangible', 'plot', 'follow', 'works', 'Grenouille', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'root', 'insidious', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'Perfume', 'unquestionably', 'devoid', 'Clarice', 'Starling', 'characters', 'can', 'justifiably', 'relate', 'As', 'much', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'eccentricity', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'unpredictable', 'sadly', 'laughable', 'conclusion', ""'re"", 'left', 'nothing', 'dwell', 'very', 'atrocities', 'Culminating', 'surprising', 'display', 'sexual', 'deviance', 'magnificence', 'allure', 'characters', 'settings', 'are', 'disbanded', 'resulting', 'disbelief', 'confusion', 'Crossing', 'boundaries', 'believability', 'even', 'predominantly', 'fantasy', 'environment', 'then', 'subjecting', 'audiences', 'little', 'sense', 'retribution', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'such', 'engrossing', 'start', 'Curiously', 'reminiscent', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'director', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'few', 'often', 'satisfyingly', 'macabre', 'only', 'truly', 'redeeming', 'aspect', 'film', 'captivating', 'score', 'recurring', 'melodic', 'theme', 'oftentimes', 'grisly', 'look', 'filthy', 'cities', 'portrayed', 'major', 'settings', 'first', 'Paris', 'where', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'born', 'then', 'Grasse', 'where', 'discover', 'secrets', 'preserving', 'scents', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'recreated', 'dismal', 'glory', 'Elaborate', 'costumes', 'striking', 'imagery', 'are', 'lavishly', 'produced', 'abundance', 'highly', 'aromatic', 'items', 'nearly', 'burst', 'screen.Fans', 'particularly', 'deranged', 'cinema', 'might', 'find', 'interesting', 'fantasy', 'palatable', 'majority', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'paled', 'Perfume', 'deficient', 'denouement', 'lengthy', 'two-and-a-half', 'hour', 'duration.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

It is entirely new -- something never seen or done before; and, even though what it attempts is disturbing and dark and morally ambiguous, it succeeds in doing it in a way which can only be termed, gorgeous and perfect.  One never sees a single wheel or gear.  One is simply inhaled, like a breath, into the nostrils of the protagonist, lives inside of his dark entrails and continues to do so long after the end credits have rolled.  The cast is used to perfection. Ben Whishaw performs a tightrope walk of balancing the audiences reaction between revulsion and empathy and never sways once on the rope. Dustin Hoffman devours his part with a gusto which we have rarely seen from him in recent years and Alan Rickman proves, once again, that he can do anything.

In contrast, it is also a story of obssession and of murder.Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) was destined to explore and experience the allure and mystery of smell. Growing up in Paris, he is obssessed with scent- no matter what it might be. With a remarkable ability to smell even the slightest and most subtle of scent, he became obssessed in capturing the fragrance of young virgins. Without regard for life, he continues to kill until he got caught and was sentenced to die.Directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run), Perfume is a study of contrast. Grenouille's power of scent and how he uses it does not differentiate the good and the bad smells of Paris. As he pursues his obssession, we are transported from the stench and cruelties of Paris into the lush and freshness of a fragrant french countryside.What is so amazing about this film, aside from the intelligent directing and cinematography, is the acting. Ben Whishaw, who only stands at 5'9"" is literally an acting giant. His portrayal of Grenouille is both chilling and fascinating. The subtle changes of emotions on his face is remarkable and deserve much praise. While the character in the Patrick S&uuml;skind novel is described as seemingly disfigured and unattractive, Whishaw is the exact opposite.

What I found in that movie's place was another movie, a more interesting one with an interesting cruel side, and that was really worth a watch. We start with a man hat claims he can identify any smell in the world and that he wants to own them all. To do this he has plans; some of his plans seem not-so-bad at first but then they take on a darker shade. And that's where the fun begins and an interesting story starts playing out.One of the main reasons this movie was so successful was the ability of our lead character to seem so many things at once. Sometimes you cold taste the menace that swirled around and sometimes you could see other pieces of persona swimming around in his tangled expressions. The life he gave tot the role was amazing because of this - I expected few things going in to the movie but I really didn't expect someone to so brazenly steal the spotlight.He was perfect.The support cast was really god as well, and all these efforts combined helped build a rather interesting storyline that I would have missed if it had not been for a suggestion on rentals.If you want a diversion that is out-of-the-ordinary and like the way the plot to the movie goes, then this might be a pick for you. I enjoyed it but, at the same time, I was looking for a B-movie to fill in my watching void and was happy that it was superbly better than ""B.""

1047846,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000MMN6YS,Tsuyoshi,"[59, 68]","If you're looking for something unusual, unconventional and unpredictable, ""Perfume"" is your film. I am not saying this will give a pleasant smell to you. Probably some people would be attracted to the complexity of the strange world where olfactory perception means everything. Or some would loath the film's story and main character itself, especially the conclusion. Whatever you may find it, Tom Tykwer's ""Perfume"" remains intriguing throughout as allegorical tale, dark comedy or serial killer suspense. Pick your choice.With John Hurt as narrator with slightly mocking tone, the eventful life story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is introduced, and from the very first moment you realize ""Perfume"" is no ordinary film. The film successfully conveys how Paris in the 18th century (at least one certain district) smelled really bad, with too realistic scene of its fish market, which is followed by the birth of Jean-Baptiste. His life is destined to be a different one, and the first chapter fully convinces us of his fate.Ben Whishaw plays adult Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his wonderful acting as the (anti-)hero virtually carries the entire film to the last. Typical rags-to-riches drama is given a twist when other characters step in his life. First Jean-Baptiste is apprenticed to Giuseppe Baldini, second-rate perfumer who lost his skills. Dustin Hoffman's fake Italian accent may annoy you, but wait for what happens. Jean-Baptiste creates a ""hit"" perfume with his superb olfactory sense, making Baldini a rich person, and then ... see it for yourself. The story is not definitely Charles Dickens.Beautiful Rachel Hurd-Wood and Alan Rickman are both memorable as aristocratic father and his only daughter. Tom Tykwer relies much on their acting talent to create the credible relations between them, which is I think still underwritten and not interesting enough. His skills as director are more effective in presenting Jean-Baptiste who can create the perfect scent in the most unique and terrifying fashion.As to its conclusion - don't worry, this is spoiler-free - you will find it either fascinating or just awful. But maybe we shouldn't take the story too seriously for ""grenouille"" also means ""frog"" in French. ""Perfume"" defies easy explanations like real perfumes you smell every day.
