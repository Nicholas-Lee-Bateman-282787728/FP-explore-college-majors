She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.Inuyasha and Kagome wander along with their friend Shippo. They come across a perverted monk, who also happens to be cursed by a demon. He is also searching for the shards of the jewel. Hoping that he will find shards and get some Kagome action, he decides to tag along with the others and becomes a valuable ally.This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable.

I think it was cool that his paintings came to life, but if that were me, I wouldn't draw like that... Heh! I don't even know how to draw that way!The last episode....

749067,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00008XRZ1,Sesho,"[1, 1]","Volume 6 of Inuyasha introuduces a new character named Miroku, who at first glance seems to be a new enemy. He's a monk who seems more interested in chasing women than he is in protecting innocents! He even tries to bust a move on Kagome, much to the jealousy of Inuyasha, and Kagome at times seems to be willing to spite her half-demon friend. But Miroku is not an ordinary human. His ancestors were cursed by the demon Naraku to pass down an awful but sometimes handy affliction. His hand is basically the equivalent of a black hole which, when released can suck anything, including our heroes into it! He also offers some clues to what happened 50 years ago when Inuyasha and Kikyo battled against each other. Inuyasha, Kagome, and Shippo will have to enlist the aid of this powerful young monk as Naraku and Inuyasha's half brother, Sesshomaru join forces!Volume 6 of this excellent series offers all the usuals of Inuyasha. High production values in the animation, humor, horror, compelling storylines, and great character interaction. The mystery of why Inuyasha and Kikyo battled so long ago is a plotline that really picks your brain and you want to find out the cause. Engrossing. The extras are pretty lame as usual, in the form of Japanese promotional ads.",5,TWO EVILS BECOME ONE,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1267,"['Volume', '6', 'Inuyasha', 'new', 'character', 'named', 'Miroku', 'who', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'new', 'enemy', 'monk', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'chasing', 'women', 'protecting', 'innocents', 'even', 'bust', 'move', 'Kagome', 'much', 'jealousy', 'Inuyasha', 'Kagome', 'times', 'be', 'willing', 'spite', 'half-demon', 'friend', 'Miroku', 'not', 'ordinary', 'human', 'ancestors', 'were', 'cursed', 'demon', 'Naraku', 'pass', 'down', 'awful', 'sometimes', 'handy', 'affliction', 'hand', 'basically', 'equivalent', 'black', 'hole', 'when', 'released', 'can', 'suck', 'anything', 'including', 'heroes', 'also', 'clues', 'what', 'happened', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Inuyasha', 'Kikyo', 'battled', 'other', 'Inuyasha', 'Kagome', 'Shippo', 'will', 'have', 'enlist', 'aid', 'powerful', 'young', 'monk', 'Naraku', 'Inuyasha', 'half', 'brother', 'Sesshomaru', 'join', 'forces', 'Volume', '6', 'excellent', 'series', 'usuals', 'Inuyasha', 'High', 'production', 'values', 'animation', 'humor', 'horror', 'compelling', 'storylines', 'great', 'character', 'interaction', 'mystery', 'why', 'Inuyasha', 'Kikyo', 'battled', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'plotline', 'really', 'brain', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'cause', 'Engrossing', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'lame', 'usual', 'form', 'Japanese', 'promotional', 'ads']",Inuyasha: Deadly Liasons - Volume 6
