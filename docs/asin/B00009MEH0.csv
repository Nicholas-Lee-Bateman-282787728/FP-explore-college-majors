754541,A3FHQ8EPEG45AU,B00009MEH0,Alan L. Wong,"[3, 3]",I really like the dialogue driven stories of Ed McBain's crime series set in NYC. I thought this would really be a bad B level cheesy piece but was pleaseantly suprized. Great acting and shots of New York and Canada. Great editing and an amazing capturing of the mood and plot style of the booksThe film stands on its own even if you never have heard of Ed McBain.

This adaptation is an excellent visualization of one book which well captures the inner life of the series. Obviously, each reader will have pictured the characters and their behavior in his own way; what these writers and performers have done is gives us their version, dirty and low-down. Whether or not realistic to what actually goes on there in the  brutal urban streets and back-alleys, they make us feel the reasonableness of their presentation. Not for everyone, but suitable for those who like their stories tough and gritty.

There is also an out-of-control aspect here to the script and the shots, but that also works.  Not your average crime procedural.  Off-beat and off-track.

754545,A2XENK52BFCHCO,B00009MEH0,Wanda Sweat,"[5, 5]","I must be honest, Dale Midkiff is one of my all-time favorite actors and that's why I bought this DVD.  That fact aside, I did enjoy the movie;  Midkiff is great as Steve Carella and he & Joe Pantoliano work well together.  My favorite scenes are the ones w/ Carella & his deaf girlfriend Teddy, they're sweet together--wish I could remember the actress's name, she's cute and plays her role well.  This is a dark movie, in lighting as well as subject matter but the good thing about that for me, is that, even though it's violent, more is implied than actually shown.  I do like action movies and there's plenty in this one but I don't like a lot of blood & gore.  You know from the dialogue and the acting just what's happened and not seeing the violence carried out doesn't in any way detract from the suspence.  One scene has ""Teddy"" being pursued by a muderer wielding a straight-razor, she does escape & inform Corella of the encounter. I don't want to give too much away, but if you're a fan of cop dramas, you should like this one.",5,very good movie,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,1039,"['must', 'be', 'honest', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'why', 'bought', 'DVD', 'fact', 'aside', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Midkiff', 'great', 'Steve', 'Carella', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'My', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'ones', 'w/', 'Carella', 'deaf', 'girlfriend', 'Teddy', ""'re"", 'sweet', 'together', 'wish', 'could', 'remember', 'actress', 'name', 'cute', 'role', 'well', 'dark', 'movie', 'lighting', 'as', 'well', 'subject', 'matter', 'good', 'thing', 'even', 'violent', 'more', 'implied', 'actually', 'shown', 'do', 'action', 'movies', 'plenty', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'know', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'not', 'seeing', 'violence', 'carried', 'out', ""n't"", 'way', 'detract', 'suspence', 'One', 'scene', 'Teddy', 'being', 'pursued', 'muderer', 'wielding', 'straight-razor', 'escape', 'inform', 'Corella', 'encounter', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', ""'re"", 'fan', 'cop', 'dramas', 'should', 'like', 'one']",N/A
