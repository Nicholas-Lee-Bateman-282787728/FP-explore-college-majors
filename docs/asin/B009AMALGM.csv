1592170,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B009AMALGM,Addicted2Amazon!,"[1, 2]","WOW.  This is what happens when film producers get FAT and LAZY.  Fat off of money that the previous films have made, and lazy with no desire to actually do their jobs well.  Every person responsible for this train wreck (with the exception of the actors, they did their best) should be embarrassed.I should preface by stating that I am a big fan of Paranormal Activity, the original.  That movie, on a show-string budget, had me pausing at every creak and bang in my house!  Very creepy and well-paced!  The 2nd one was too drawn-out but paid off in the end, and the third one was, in my opinion, almost as good as the first.Then this worthless piece of garbage was birthed.  The ratings were bad, but I wasn't looking for a masterpiece, just a few good jumps, a crazy last 10 minutes and a continuation of the Katie/Kristi/demon saga.  Instead, we get an extended Hallmark commercial of another  ""all-American"" suburban family living in another McMansion.  We get cheesy home video reenactments of cute little kids doing cheesy cute little kid things.  We get one kid who acts slightly creepy, in a made-for-TV Sci-Fi channel sort-of way.  We get lots and lots of teenage shenanigans, like trying to be cool while making mating overtures (uh, creepy, and not in a good way) while Skype-ing and cursing a lot.  Unfortunately, the teenagers carry A LOT of this movie.  This may be great if you're a typical mainstream teenager.  I'm an adult, so I found this extremely annoying and a waste of my time.The pacing on this film is not just slow, it's non-existent.  I am not exaggerating when I say that 90% of this film is just teenagers hanging out and trying to be cool and cute kid home videos.  I'm not kidding.And the aforementioned Katie/Kristi storyline?  This movie took that from eerie and mysterious to corny and ridiculous.The creepy atmosphere in the other films is gone. Dead. I jumped just twice in this entire film.  The first time was at the very beginning, during the Trick-or-Treat sequence, and again near the very very absolute end.  I'm easy to scare and love things jumping out at me, so this was extremely disappointing. It didn't even seem like a horror movie most of the time.  I mean, I watch a horror movie to be scared, even if only here and there for a few seconds, and this movie can't even do that???  I could've been doing something more exciting, like my nails.Yeah, so again, I really enjoyed PA I-III.  I absolutely hate this movie and rue the day it was ever conceived as an idea.  It was an hour+ of my life that I can't get back.  If you're smart or you value your money, you'll avoid this.  I haven't given up on the series and will probably check out the ""The Marked Ones"" (finally, a non-white, non-suburban, non-McMansion-living, non-Hallmark commercial family gets haunted!!)...as long as the creators actually gave a damn and did it right.  As for this movie, so glad I saw it for free.

I have watched all of them and with each installment the story ideas have declined quite a lot as it happens to many movie series.The story begins with the ending of Para 2 where Katie abducts her nephew Hunter and this film then starts from 2011 when Alex (Kathryn Newton) and her boyfriend Ben (Matt Shively) start noticing there&#8217;s something very weird about Robbie (Brady Allen)Alex&#8217;s mother take in Robbie when his mother has to go to the emergency room one night and it is at this point when weird things start happening at their house.One has to have some prior knowledge of the Para series to enjoy this film fully and the filmmakers assume that audiences have watched the other films in the series.

1592177,A3327KH3Z7GZ1F,B009AMALGM,"Anthony L. Wallace ""ALW""","[2, 4]","From the success of the first paranormal activity we got suspense and mystery behind the activity taking place. With this fourth entry in the franchise the mystery and suspense has become non-existent. The question we have to ask ourselves is where is this going? And why? Nothing really happens in this installment as the majority of the time you see people recording things for some unknown reason; until activity starts happening which is like 30 minutes into it. The other element is the technology being used to record the events. Its not that laptops are a bad idea to record events but when it seems like a dozen laptops are being used around the house instead of cameras makes it ridiculous. In any event, the weak part of this movie is the script. More jump scares are being utilized rather than true suspense; well with an exception of the last ten minutes of the movie. It is clear that the studio is looking for a cash grab and will continue to dish out sequels until diminishing returns kicks in. In contrast, the Saw movies may have blown its wad after the third installment, but what made the franchise so successful was not only the traps but the story.  There was progression with the Saw movies in terms of story; rather Paranormal Activity jumps in timeline to the event where there is no clear direction to where the story is headed. The Saw movies had fun messing with the timelines (Saw 3,4, and 5), but Paranormal acts as stand-alone films with a strand of story from the first movie. The big problem is keeping the viewer engaged with whats going on in the movie; however, the majority of the run-times have had little to nothing going on. From the first movie everything was fresh and a mystery, but with sub-sequent installments the audience is familiar with what to expect and nothing has changed in terms of directing. Paranormal Activity 4 is clearly the weakest of the series, which is unfortunate because some the performances from the actors are descent. With the green-light of Paranormal Activity 5 in October 2013 and a latino-spinoff in the Spring, only one can hope that there is a clear direction as to where this is all going.

1592179,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B009AMALGM,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 2]","I'm no horror movie film snob, but I know a bad horror movie when I see one. It's crazy how we're at the fourth movie in the series now, and people still manage to get scared watching these things. In case you haven't figured it out, here's the outline for any Paranormal Activity movie:-haunted house-house has tons of cameras set up, be it surveillance cameras or computers with cameras-ghost in haunted house gradually messes with the residents-if there's a kid involved, it's either going to be possessed or can communicate with the ghost-something finally happens in the last 5 minutes and then it's overThat's it. These movies aren't scary, they're just annoying. I don't even know where to really start with this one. Unless you're a young kid who's never seen a horror movie before (let alone spent much time on the internet), there isn't anything here that should get so much as a quiet gasp out of you.Alex is a young high school girl living with her parents and little  brother in Nevada. She spends a lot of time with her friend Ben and talks to him with a video chat program on her computer. When the two of them go out to a tree house late at night, they find the neighbor's young child, Robbie, all alone. His mom gets sick suddenly and it's up to Alex's family to take care of the little guy. He isn't very sociable and rarely speaks. As the days go on, odd things happen in Alex's house, like objects moving, weird noises, and a knife flying up into the ceiling when someone is preparing dinner. As if that wasn't bad enough, Alex notices a bunch of cars outside Robbie's house one night, though his mom is still in the hospital, AND Robbie drew a mysterious symbol on Alex's brother's back, which is related to witchcraft. That's a good sign, right?My biggest gripe with this movie is how much of a wasted opportunity it is. The story with Alex and Ben is fairly interesting, considering they're the only two people who are investigating the strange happenings. Alex's parents don't do much aside from the usual mom and dad thing when something strange happens, even when a big chandelier crashes to the ground and almost kills Alex. The kids try to explain things to the parents, and get brushed off like it's no big deal. If more time were spent with these two, who had good chemistry, and less time on long scenes of nothing happening, there could have been a good movie here. The ghost that haunts the house doesn't do a whole lot either. Aside from two incidents, including the chandelier one I just mentioned, all he's really doing is playing small pranks on everyone. Even the third movie, which I consider a bit worse than this one, had a little bit more of a threatening presence with its ghost when it would go after the little girls.And here's the other big problem with this movie, and also the series as a whole. Because the cameras are in fixed locations, you essentially play a guessing game of where a shadow's going to appear or where something's going to fall. There's no suspense because you're expecting something to happen at any moment, and that's not what horror is. There's one part where they even use a cheap attempt at a scare where a cat jumps in front of the camera. I half-expected him to wink at the camera as if he was going ""gotcha!"". Did anyone else wonder how these laptops were able to record so much footage? Ben explains that his computer automatically saves every single video chat session he has, or whenever the camera's on it keeps recording and saves everything. The same goes for the phones too, I'm guessing, since this is supposed to be a found footage movie, and with half the movie being filmed on a phone...ugh, I need to stop thinking about this one. As dumb as teenagers in horror movies usually are, it didn't make any sense when something pretty big towards the end was happening, and someone was STILL recording with their phone, getting some pretty clear shots while they were running away.Nothing in the movie scared me, most of the acting was terrible (especially from a returning character), there's too much footage shot in the daytime, and the only cool thing shown isn't even a scare, but a few shots using the Xbox 360's Kinect, with it's infrared tracking dots. Who knew that thing would finally be interesting? The only other thing that bumps the rating up to 2 stars for me is a dumb 'guy' reason, and it's that Alex's mom, played by Alexondra Lee, is pretty dang hot, and when she got some solo screen time, it kept me from falling asleep.I can't recommend this movie to anyone. I watched it not that long ago, and actually forgot all about it until I went through my Recently Watched queue.

Be aware there may be one vague spoiler reference toward the end.I only watched Paranormal Activity 4 for the first time very recently, admittedly having put it off due in part to its poor reputation, but I was actually very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I certainly understand how people may have grown bored with the series, and it's true, the ""edge of your seat"" factor isn't quite as intense as it once was, but it definitely has the same general feel as the rest of the films and blends in alongside them seamlessly. I thought the young female lead was likeable, and the addition of the strange neighbor boy was interesting. To me, the parents almost seemed TOO aloof, almost to the point of caricature, but I suppose they were written that way intentionally to emphasize the importance of the children's roles. My one complaint, if I had to make one, was that things ended up pretty much the same way as they did in part 3, and nothing really happened to make the arcing storyline move forward in any significant way. A lingering question or two may have been answered, but seriously, it's time to either explore the whole witch thing in-depth or get off the pot, lol. In and of itself though, I found it very entertaining, with a fair share of suspenseful - if not exactly scary - moments, and would surely recommend it to those who may still on the line.",4,"Great movie by itself, but doesn't really move the series forward",1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,1660,"['wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'nearly', 'as', 'wordy', 'detailed', 'here', 'normally', 'might', 'one', 'reviews', 'especially', 'late', 'date', 'so', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'already', 'just', 'wanted', 'toss', 'two', 'cents', 'take', 'quick', 'stab', 'defending', 'negativity', 'received', 'Be', 'aware', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'vague', 'spoiler', 'reference', 'end.I', 'only', 'watched', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'first', 'time', 'very', 'recently', 'admittedly', 'having', 'put', 'off', 'due', 'part', 'poor', 'reputation', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'certainly', 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'grown', 'bored', 'series', 'true', 'edge', 'seat', 'factor', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'intense', 'once', 'was', 'definitely', 'same', 'general', 'feel', 'rest', 'films', 'blends', 'alongside', 'seamlessly', 'thought', 'young', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'likeable', 'addition', 'strange', 'neighbor', 'boy', 'was', 'interesting', 'parents', 'almost', 'seemed', 'TOO', 'aloof', 'almost', 'point', 'caricature', 'suppose', 'were', 'written', 'way', 'intentionally', 'emphasize', 'importance', 'children', 'roles', 'one', 'complaint', 'had', 'make', 'one', 'was', 'things', 'ended', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'part', '3', 'nothing', 'really', 'happened', 'make', 'arcing', 'storyline', 'move', 'forward', 'significant', 'way', 'lingering', 'question', 'two', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'answered', 'seriously', 'time', 'whole', 'witch', 'thing', 'in-depth', 'get', 'off', 'pot', 'lol', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fair', 'share', 'suspenseful', 'not', 'exactly', 'scary', 'moments', 'would', 'surely', 'recommend', 'who', 'may', 'still', 'line']",N/A

(THIS IS SPOILER FREE REVIEW) I said this before I will say it again: ""The Paranormal Activity movies is the new Saw."" Yes this series has basically taken over where the Saw series ended.....at least for now. For that each year around Halloween we all go to see the new lately installment of this ongoing franchise. ""PA4"" is what you ask for when going into it: getting a unsettling feeling, objects moving in the background, few characters acting strange, jump scares and a big conclusion. Unfortunately, this is the weakest installment in this franchise so far. It brings nothing new to table I hate to say it. It's all the same. It doesn't live up to it's expectations according to the advertisement. The last film really set the bar high and this one was a bit of a letdown.

Soon after, eerie things start happening in the household, some of which focus on the girl's younger brother Wyatt. As the bumps in the night become more pronounced, the mysteries surrounding Robbie's family and the house across the street grow to the point where the only thing for the teen girl to do is investigate herself.I really enjoyed PA 1 and 2, 3 was okay and I was really disappointed with this one.

I was completely let down. There is no story, no plot, no dialogue, no tension, and.....no scares. None at all. I could barely hold my eyes open. I looked to see how much longer of the movie was left and I was one hour and twelve minutes in and NOTHING had happened at all...except excruciating boredom. And I still had 24 minutes to go. The wonderful Katie Featherston looked like she had nothing to do, nothing to say in her few moments on screen. She seemed to be there for no reason except to kill a couple of people. I think Katie is probably tired of these movies, though they have made her fairly famous now. She is quite talented and very pretty.So, the movie came to an end that by now didn't even matter. The ending had a couple of moments, but the endurance of waiting this brief couple of moments out was painful. And as I said, I truly love these movies. But I will not purchase this one to own. I'm only out the rental cost. Oh, the bonus featurette was just as bad. Just a repeat of a couple of scenes.I understand part 5 is in the bag. I think they have run out of ideas and story lines.

And the ""viral campaign"" never took off like it did for #2 and #3. It was as if even those involved simply weren't very committed/interested in the film they were making.The reviews were ALL tepid--even those that sort of praised it--and word of mouth was dismal. The ""actual people watching the film"" TV ad was so over-the-top, it became a joke.And then the film itself was a mess. Why have the wink-wink ""in jokes"" of the kid riding the bike like THE SHINING? It takes us ""out"" of the movie we're watching...and ads zero to the film. Same with the firstfake"" drag scene of the girl. Again, why remind us that we're watching a movie, why take us out of the experience?And NOTHING happens for so long into this movie, it's just people talking and talking and talking. The few little scares are already shown in the trailer, which they have done before...but those are the ONLY scares! So we are not surprised.And it's clear that the writers/directors had no real ideas of what Toby was to do this time. In other words, WHY does he levitate the girl? If the goal is to kill everyone, that just do it. The levitation scene is simply to impress US, the viewers. But we've seen that before, in a dozen films...and in the trailer! So there is no shock or surprise. And why bounce the ball down the stairs? And why is there scene after scene in the dark with the xBox? Toby is ""better"" than moving some dots around but they feature that xBox feature into the ground.Finally, the ending (no spoiler, if you've seen PA3)...is the SAME ending as PA3. We learn nothing. In fact, you can remove PA4 and you've learned NOTHING. When PA5 comes out, hopefully the filmmakers have learned from the dismal box office, word of mouth and reviews for PA4 to PUT THE SCARES BACK IN. And have a REASON for the film.All the above being said, I WILL buy PA4 and here's why: I wasn't that impressed with PA3 in the theater but the extra footage--not much, just a few scenes of Toby messing with the girls more--made for a MUCH more ""sinister"" film. Not sure why they were cut from the film, but they really add to PA3. Same with PA2--and maybe these movies are just better seen at home.So, here's hoping that PA5 will really deliver.

There will be some minor spoilers ahead, so you've been warned.The first film excelled at building up tension and hitting you with something unexpected.  This time, we have the absurd idea of the Kinect Cam watching the living room at all times.  This is the premise for ""seeing"" the activity, motion in the IR dots.  We do get some webcam footage from a laptop, because of course everyone walks around all the time carrying their laptop with the webcam on.If this wasn't absurd enough, the plot revolves around the child kidnapped in PA2 who shows up next door with her ""mother"" who then goes missing, so of course the police decided ""we'll just let the neighbors watch the kid"".  Even with a movie about the paranormal, this simple bypass of Child Protective Services is a glaring plot sore which is even more unbelievable than the supernatural in the film.  The rest of the movie goes as expected, no twists to throw the audience off.  The ending is a horror cliche as our heroine does something that no one in their right mind would do given the same circumstances.While the 2nd film essentially set up how the events of the first film happened and the 3rd was a prequel (with plot holes), this 4th installment adds nothing to the franchise as a whole.

The last I knew those knuckleheads on Ghost Hunters Uber-Global have yet to definitely catch so much as the shadow of a legitimate spectre on tap - EVPs not included - but these PARANORMAL ACTIVITY folks just have the spirits popping up left and right.  Granted, maybe they're not all demons - at this juncture, who can tell?  Still, if you're looking for some harmless fun and equally harmless scares, this is probably the `found footage' franchise for you.  It's certainly blossomed into its own cottage industry, that's for sure.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of character and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Katie (the lovely Katie Featherston) was last seen - in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY time - five years ago, the night she vamoosed with her nephew, Hunter.  In this fourth installment, she's taken up residence across the street from the average American family, and (wouldn't you know it?) she and her would-be son are about to turn up the heat on Alex (played with solid charm by easy-on-the-eyes newcomer Kathryn Newton), Wyatt - or is he? - (Aiden Lovekamp), and her feuding parents, Doug (Stephen Dunham) and Holly (Alexondra Lee).Does anyone ever make it out alive of these pictures?!?!Let me be frank, movie lovers: despite what you might think of these PARANORMAL pictures, they're a veritable goldmine for the folks behind them.  With an average budget of $5 million, this fourth episode grossed over $50 million in the US alone.  That's no chump change.  So you can bet that if there's so much as a heartbeat trapped inside the `found footage' industry, they're gonna do everything they can to wring it out as far as they can.  (Yes, sources confirm that a fifth one is in the offing.)And, in their defense, they are mostly harmless fun.  There is some minor magic at work in these frames.  I often find myself studying the edges of the screen, watching for things going on in the background, looking for shifting shadows or watching for items in motion that shouldn't be.  That, after all, is the allure of any ghost story, good or bad, and PARANORMAL has performed some small wonders in bringing that genre back to life.  Just look at how many imitators there are in the megaplexes or straight-to-DVD production houses today, and you know it's a money-maker.Now, NOT in their defense ...So much of 4 has been done before, and, shamefully, it's been done even better in earlier chapters of this franchise's history.  When that reality starts to rear its ugly head, maybe it's time for (A) taking some time off or (B) find some way to amp up the interest alongside the creativity once more.  Now, I doubt that'll happen - certainly not any time soon - so let your cards fall as they might.To their credit, the producers have incorporated some new ideas into the watered-down plot.  There are far more devices that can produce video - laptops, cell phones, gaming consoles, etc. - and they're used as creatively as they can be within this format.  You can find comfort in knowing that, if it films anything, it's going to find its way into this franchise.  At some point, this stretches the believability of the whole `found footage' idea - at what point does the audience fully comprehend that what they're watching isn't so much `found' as it is edited together from multiple audio/visual sources?  Methinks it has a shelf-life, and, presently, they're nearing the expiration date.Lastly, I've honestly given PARANORMAL some kudos for trying to think outside of the box so far as characters go.  In parts 1, 2, and 3, the screenwriters avoided a lot of the typical traps and trappings of the broader horror format; this time out, they aren't nearly as competent.  It's one thing to predict the scares (of which most in here are easily predictable), but it's another thing to have the legitimate violence excised by the producers' edits.  Sure, some scares are better left unseen; but when you give us so few unforeseen ones, you should at least let us see them in their entirety, not cut away right before the glass breaks, the knife drops, or the neck breaks.  The final few minutes of the film spool out to unprecedented developments that defy logic as well as the franchise's central mythology.  Where are the possibly going with this?  Only the man behind the curtain knows, and methinks he's now making it up as he goes.PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4 is produced by Room 101.  As for the technical specs, it all looks and sounds as credible as any of the previous `found footage' installments.  Sadly, there's not a single special feature.RECOMMENDED.  Look, if you're this far along in hoping to understand all of the mythology at the center of the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise, then you're going to see this one whether I give it a thumbs up or not.  I'll admit that I find these mostly a guilty pleasure - not quite all that entertaining, but, like a car crash, I just can't force myself to look away.  I'm figuring one of these times I'm going to see something that'll truly inspire me to know all of these spirits biggest secrets, and then (and only then) will I be able to look away.  At best, it's only 90 minutes, and, at worst, it's only 90 minutes.  It's harmless fun, if you enjoy it, though I'll admit that the scares this time around were pretty thin.",2,"More Normal Than PARANORMAL, These Folks Are Really Making Fools Out Of Those Ghost Hunter

I loathe them more than anything in cinematic history. I vainly hope that the next one couldn't be any worse than the one before it. However, they continue to disappoint me with ""Paranormal Activity 4.""A family takes in a little boy when his mother is hospitalized. Unexplainable things begin happening shortly after his arrival. Is it all coincidence or did the child bring something supernatural into the house with him?Writer Christopher Landon and directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman really have nothing new to add to what has come before in the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise. Sure, we get some new ways to incorporate found footage into the movie like computer and iPhone cameras as well as Kinect sensors. The visuals and outcome are all the same, though. We get shadows, bumps, flickering lights, books falling, utensils floating, and a laundry list of other hoaxes and illusions too long to list.I'm not going to say there aren't some genuinely scary moments. They're few and far between. Viewing ""Paranormal Activity 4"" is the equivalent of watching paint dry for 90 minutes with a bubble rising and popping every 10 minutes.I have the formula for the films figured out as well. There's a low rumbling every time something ""scary"" is about to happen. Unfortunately, nothing every REALLY happens until the last 10 minutes. All we get before that are some loud bumps and a few elaborate but mostly elementary parlor tricks.Creator Oren Peli does deserve a standing ovation for tricking so many people (not me; I see them for free, thankfully) into wasting money on these films year after year. ""Paranormal Activity 4"" alone brought in $140,706,358 off of a budget of $5 million. The entire series so far has cost $13,015,000 to make and grossed $714,788,650. Now that's just smart business!Is there any way to really gauge the video or audio quality of ""Paranormal Activity 4?"" The movie is made up of video, computer camera, and night-vision footage of different qualities. We are given zero cinematography to praise or damn here. The 5.1 surround sound offers nothing to viewers except when there's a loud bang or low rumble from somewhere in the room. There's no musical score or real dialogue to speak of.The ""Paranormal Activity 4: Unrated Edition"" features nine minutes of extra footage not seen in theaters. I can't even begin to imagine what the additional scenes could be. There's no way I was sitting through both versions to find out.The only bonus material included on the Blu-ray version is a 28-minute featurette entitled ""The Recovered Files."" It's basically deleted scenes in the form of additional ""found footage."" Congratulations are in order to anyone who can sit through it.Something else that eludes me is why they rate these movies R. There's nothing here that isn't seen in a PG-13 horror film or watered-down teen sex romp. All they'd have to do to make even more money at the box office is cut out three or four expletives. They'd then have a teen-friendly horror movie tailor-made for kiddies to enjoy.I've said it before and I'll say it again. The ""Paranormal Activity"" films are made for people who don't regularly watch horror movies. Anyone who tells you any differently is lying. ""Paranormal Activity 4"" is another lackluster entry in a franchise which will continue to be a successful Halloween novelty until they stop making money. Therefore, I see no end in sight.",2,"Blu-ray Review: ""Paranormal Activity 4: Unrated Edition""",1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,3533,"['time', 'watch', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movie', 'walk', 'away', 'wondering', 'why', 'put', 'experience', 'loathe', 'more', 'anything', 'cinematic', 'history', 'vainly', 'hope', 'next', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'one', 'However', 'continue', 'disappoint', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'family', 'little', 'boy', 'when', 'mother', 'hospitalized', 'Unexplainable', 'things', 'begin', 'happening', 'shortly', 'arrival', 'coincidence', 'did', 'child', 'bring', 'something', 'supernatural', 'house', 'Writer', 'Christopher', 'Landon', 'directors', 'Henry', 'Joost', 'Ariel', 'Schulman', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'new', 'add', 'what', 'come', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'franchise', 'Sure', 'get', 'new', 'ways', 'incorporate', 'found', 'footage', 'movie', 'computer', 'iPhone', 'cameras', 'as', 'well', 'Kinect', 'sensors', 'visuals', 'outcome', 'are', 'same', 'though', 'get', 'shadows', 'bumps', 'flickering', 'lights', 'books', 'falling', 'utensils', 'floating', 'laundry', 'list', 'other', 'hoaxes', 'illusions', 'too', 'long', 'list.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'genuinely', 'scary', 'moments', ""'re"", 'few', 'far', 'Viewing', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'equivalent', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', '90', 'minutes', 'bubble', 'rising', 'popping', '10', 'minutes.I', 'have', 'formula', 'films', 'figured', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'low', 'rumbling', 'time', 'something', 'scary', 'happen', 'Unfortunately', 'nothing', 'REALLY', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'get', 'are', 'loud', 'bumps', 'few', 'elaborate', 'mostly', 'elementary', 'parlor', 'tricks.Creator', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'deserve', 'standing', 'ovation', 'tricking', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'not', 'see', 'free', 'thankfully', 'wasting', 'money', 'films', 'year', 'year', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'alone', 'brought', '140,706,358', 'budget', '5', 'million', 'entire', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'cost', '13,015,000', 'make', 'grossed', '714,788,650', 'Now', 'just', 'smart', 'business', 'there', 'way', 'really', 'gauge', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'movie', 'made', 'video', 'computer', 'camera', 'night-vision', 'footage', 'different', 'qualities', 'are', 'given', 'zero', 'cinematography', 'praise', 'damn', 'here', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'nothing', 'viewers', 'when', 'loud', 'bang', 'low', 'rumble', 'somewhere', 'room', 'musical', 'score', 'real', 'dialogue', 'speak', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'Unrated', 'Edition', 'features', 'nine', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'not', 'seen', 'theaters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'imagine', 'what', 'additional', 'scenes', 'could', 'be', 'way', 'was', 'sitting', 'versions', 'find', 'out.The', 'only', 'material', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '28-minute', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Recovered', 'Files', 'basically', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'form', 'additional', 'found', 'footage', 'Congratulations', 'are', 'order', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'sit', 'it.Something', 'else', 'why', 'rate', 'movies', 'R.', 'nothing', 'here', ""n't"", 'seen', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'film', 'watered-down', 'teen', 'sex', 'romp', ""'d"", 'have', 'do', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'cut', 'out', 'three', 'four', 'expletives', ""'d"", 'then', 'have', 'teen-friendly', 'horror', 'movie', 'tailor-made', 'kiddies', 'enjoy.I', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'regularly', 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', 'Anyone', 'who', 'differently', 'lying', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'lackluster', 'entry', 'franchise', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'successful', 'Halloween', 'novelty', 'stop', 'making', 'money', 'Therefore', 'see', 'end', 'sight']",N/A

I'm a fan of the PA series, and I highly recommend, if you're a fan, skipping the unrated version and watching the theater release.As for the theater release, I'm not sure why there's so much hating on this film. It seems to follow the same formula as the others -- an examination of an average family's reaction to paranormal activity in their lives, with a backstory of possession. There are fake scares and practical jokes, just like in the other movies. And there's a tiny parcel of new information about the world we're in, just like in the other movies. Attacks on the family  are as brutal as any we've seen in the other films, perhaps more extreme. So I'm not sure why people see this film as not scary. The main difference in PA4 is that there's someone smart enough -- Alex -- to understand right away that something dangerous has entered their lives. Perhaps that gives the film a less mysterious tone.These aren't big special effects films. These are films about families and human reactions. Which is why I find them interesting.The only problem I had with the film relates to bad special effects and the hamhanded use of infrared recording. The recording itself isn't a problem for me. I don't care whether x-box is featured, it makes sense for the film. But the  special effects revealed through infrared are poorly done, to the point of being comical. This is not a small problem; it breaks the mood of the film. But it doesn't mean the entire film should be trashed for it.I have to give the filmmakers credit for finding new ways to create found footage.

Now I'm sure no racism at all was planned--hold on a second, I just have to go to the bathroom right now because I had too much Mountain Dew to drink--but I still found this explanation about as believable as Barack Hussein Obama claiming that a YouTube video was the reason behind American ambassador Chris Stevens' murder!I won't give the ending away, yet let's just say that the Dracula fellow from Bram Stoker's Dracula and also even the stupid-looking Asian girl from the Grudge make a brief cameo.

For this alone it is worth taking a peak at, just if you enjoy jumping and such, if still at cheap price. (I paid $7.99 and would not recommend more than that, the $5 bin would have been better.)  As part of the franchise, I will admit it was weak. It is as if they made a movie and remembered it was suppose to be a sequel.  It was confusing as to how it all connected at first and......SPOILER ALERT.....PLEASE DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW PLOT POINTS.... I am still trying to figure out how the baby nephew of Katie that she kidnapped (Hunter)  was the kid not living with her and who was the kid living with her? And Katie was &#34;hospitalized&#34; and not about for half of the movie, and when taken to the hospital by trained professionals, I can assume, they left a small child alone to wander about the neighborhood waiting to be taken in. No children's services. Did we go a hundred years back in time?  And who was the little apparition that followed the boys when they were also talking to the larger one, who I assume was our &#34;beloved&#34; Toby.  When Katie did show up, was she possessed only sometimes and semi-possessed others?  What was her deal?  The ending was....well where did all the women come from?  They really need to pin down how many they consider to be in a witch's coven, because that looked like far too many...or maybe they are just going for an all female demonic cult now. Taking out the very few &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; threads, it could have been a good spooky movie on its own.

1592260,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B009AMALGM,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[7, 10]","Unlike many other so-called horror movie fans, I actually like the Paranormal Activity franchise.  However, ""Paranormal Activity 4"" really isn't very good at all.  Like the other three before it, ""Paranormal Activity 4"" does have a degree of suspense and atmosphere, but not nearly as much as the other three before it, and it definitely shows in the finished product.  I would compare this one to ""Paranormal Activity 2"", but it's not as good.  In fact, I would say that ""Paranormal Activity"", ""Paranormal Activity 3"", ""Paranormal Activity 2"" and then ""Paranormal Activity 4"" are the rankings from best to worst.With that being said, this review shall focus on the pros and cons of ""Paranormal Activity 4"" but will also make comparisons to the original ""Paranormal Activity"" in an attempt to show how this particular entry was very slow to develop causing it to suffer in its ability to create horror.  Indeed, this movie lacks the suspense, atmosphere and mystery of the entries that came before it.""Paranormal Activity 4"" is about what happened to Katie and Hunter Rey after Katie (possessed by a demon) had kidnapped the child.  The movie picks up with a new family including a teenaged girl, Ellen, and her little brother, Wyatt.  I would submit that this particular movie focuses too much on the teenage girl and her boyfriend, Ben, and this creates a lot of silly scenes that works against the horror the film is trying to generate.  These fillers scenes take away from the film and the result is most definitely way too much boring scenes where nothing important happens in this entry to the point where the movie gets bogged down and becomes downright boring.  One could argue that this is good character development, but the characters just aren't that interesting to devote that much time to an excuse for teenaged puppy love, and even if they were, there is still too much time devoted to something that really doesn't matter or have anything to do with the plot of this film.  Perhaps that is the theme of the Paranormal Activity franchise, but whereas the others were able to generate a sense of suspense, mystery and atmosphere, ""Paranormal Activity 4"" really, really struggled in this area.  The acting was okay, but not nearly as good as what we have seen the entries prior to this one.""Paranormal Activity 4"" seemed to cater to the teenaged crowd, and this was a disappointing angle in my opinion that goes away from what the horror that the original had established.  One of the major problems in ""Paranormal Activity 4"" is that it is too reliant on the ending to attempt to shock the viewer, and not enough overt actions occur in the first part or the middle part of the film.  As I stated before, ""Paranormal Activity"" really struggles to create suspense to keep the viewer interested until its decent ending.  I found the focus on the strange little boy, Robbie, to be rather misplaced, annoying and ineffective.  To the franchise's credit, ""Paranormal Activity"" has attempted to link each entry to keep a certain continuity in the storyline, but I would argue that this storyline has really run its course, and they are for all intents and purposes beating a dead horse here.While ""Paranormal Activity 4"" does provide some of what it had in prior movies in the franchise with its treatment of the paranormal disturbances, it is clearly fewer and farther between moments of primarily unnecessary and annoying filler.  Pretty much, this whole movie could have taken place in 30 minutes because where the original ""Paranormal Activity"" created mystery, suspense and atmosphere throughout the movie, ""Paranormal Activity 4"" largely fails in this exercise even for the most patient of viewers like myself.  ""Paranormal Activity 4"" is for completists only unless you are a rabid fan of the franchise, because quite frankly, two (2) stars is pretty darn generous for this film.",2,Not enough happens in this one.,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,3893,"['many', 'other', 'so-called', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'actually', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'franchise', 'However', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'really', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'other', 'three', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'have', 'degree', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'three', 'definitely', 'finished', 'product', 'would', 'compare', 'one', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '3', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2', 'then', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'are', 'rankings', 'best', 'worst.With', 'being', 'said', 'review', 'shall', 'focus', 'pros', 'cons', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'comparisons', 'original', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'attempt', 'show', 'how', 'particular', 'entry', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'develop', 'causing', 'suffer', 'ability', 'create', 'horror', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'mystery', 'entries', 'came', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'what', 'happened', 'Katie', 'Hunter', 'Rey', 'Katie', 'possessed', 'demon', 'had', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'movie', 'up', 'new', 'family', 'including', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'Ellen', 'little', 'brother', 'Wyatt', 'would', 'submit', 'particular', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'teenage', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'lot', 'silly', 'scenes', 'horror', 'film', 'trying', 'generate', 'fillers', 'scenes', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'result', 'most', 'definitely', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'boring', 'scenes', 'where', 'nothing', 'important', 'entry', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'bogged', 'down', 'becomes', 'downright', 'boring', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'characters', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'devote', 'much', 'time', 'excuse', 'teenaged', 'puppy', 'love', 'even', 'were', 'still', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'something', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'plot', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'theme', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'franchise', 'others', 'were', 'able', 'generate', 'sense', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'atmosphere', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'really', 'really', 'struggled', 'area', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'entries', 'prior', 'one', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'seemed', 'cater', 'teenaged', 'crowd', 'was', 'disappointing', 'angle', 'opinion', 'away', 'what', 'horror', 'original', 'had', 'established', 'One', 'major', 'problems', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'too', 'reliant', 'ending', 'attempt', 'shock', 'viewer', 'not', 'enough', 'overt', 'actions', 'occur', 'first', 'part', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'stated', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'really', 'create', 'suspense', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'decent', 'ending', 'found', 'focus', 'strange', 'little', 'boy', 'Robbie', 'be', 'rather', 'misplaced', 'annoying', 'ineffective', 'franchise', 'credit', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'attempted', 'link', 'entry', 'keep', 'certain', 'continuity', 'storyline', 'would', 'argue', 'storyline', 'really', 'run', 'course', 'are', 'intents', 'purposes', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'here.While', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'provide', 'what', 'had', 'prior', 'movies', 'franchise', 'treatment', 'paranormal', 'disturbances', 'clearly', 'fewer', 'farther', 'moments', 'primarily', 'unnecessary', 'annoying', 'filler', 'Pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'place', '30', 'minutes', 'where', 'original', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'created', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'largely', 'exercise', 'even', 'most', 'patient', 'viewers', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'completists', 'only', 'are', 'rabid', 'fan', 'franchise', 'quite', 'frankly', 'two', '2', 'stars', 'pretty', 'darn', 'generous', 'film']",N/A

1592263,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B009AMALGM,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[0, 0]","You remember that debut trailer for this flick, when it showed as a webcam conversation that started to get glitch then a whirlwind of cryptic things started happening, causing mass confusion? Unfortunately that, my main point of hoping for something to happen, never happened. Neither did a couple other things from a couple other trailers, not even in the unrated edition, making me wonder why they bothered adding 9 minutes of footage if they decided to not throw everything in?And I do mean they seemed like they didn't throw everything in since this PA, unlike the past installments, definitely had events more spread out and some the creepier moments, though jump-worthy, simply didn't come up to par.This is more of a continuation (of sorts) to the first (finally, an actual sequel- not a film with a progressive number and ending up going farther back), and a lot of things are more hinted at than anything else. At times, this ends up ruining some of the suspense. Really, the only advanced tricks done to this installment was adding Xbox Kinect to the mix for tech value (that and Rob Zombie, apparently, make for a great dance party). And it seems the Kinect gets about equal screentime as the laptop camera (courtesy of the heroine's boyfriend). And yet, maybe it was just the TV I have, but the familiar ""rumble"" sound that precedes the creepy stuff that happens seemed absent. Even in the last half hour, where the crazy stuff should've really picked up and go over-the-top, it really doesn't, it seems like they simply went for ""just enough"" to make sure it appeased certain audiences, not all who enjoy efficient jumps, rather than wasted jump moments.Luckily, it did have a couple classy visual references to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (which got me grinning), and yet, in the final shot, it still didn't go over-the-top, but just went the path of the ridiculous then ended on what I felt to be a second-rate ending.

1592272,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B009AMALGM,John's Horror Corner,"[3, 5]","They dropped the ball on this one and left a bad taste in my mouth marking, perhaps, an end to this otherwise well-done franchise.  Not scary.  Not creepy.  Not good.I loved Paranormal Activity (2008), perhaps enjoyed Paranormal Activity 2 (2010) even more, and, despite being my least favorite, I even liked Paranormal Activity 3 (2011).  These three movies set the same stage with the same types of slow-building creepy scares while obscurely adding detail to the origin of their poltergeist.This fourth installment has the same directors as Paranormal Activity 3 (2011), but they seemed to have strayed from the formula that worked so well in the previous films.  For example, parts one to three open by introducing us to young couples and families that are likable, and they did this well so that we viewers would actually give a damn when bad things start happening to these characters.  They're always some variant of an American family portrait and it's easy for us to identify with them.  Part four begins by introducing us to Alex, a young teen, and her sort of annoying boyfriend.  Contrary to the prequels she is just handed to us and no effort is made to show her finer qualities or her relationship with her parents.  In fact, the parents are more implied than presented until later in the movie, when they become more integral to the story.  We don't even get the notion that the parents have a happy marriage as our victems did in Poltergeist or the earlier Paranormal Activity films.  As a result, we don't know much about them and feel indifferent about their haunting.Alex is meant to be a protagonist much as the daughter was in Paranormal Activity 2.  She does the things a protagonist does, but I never bought it.  Her character was ineffective.  As the story progresses and her parents begin to experience the haunting, we are just then starting to learn about them.  Oh, and the franchise story seems to be getting obscured rather than developed in this fourth film which was, for lack of a better word, annoying.Alex's family takes in their neighbor's (Katie Featherson; Paranormal Activity, Paranormal Activity 2, Paranormal Activity 3) young son Robbie after she goes to the hospital sick.  After taking in this quirky child and his invisible friend, some strange things start happening.  We don't know what Katie was doing between her disappearance (at the end of Paranormal Activity 2) and this movie.  She's just dropped in our lap and we have to just deal with it.  Robbie paints a color-by-numbers witchcraft symbol on Wyatt (Alex's little brother) which evidently indicates that he is to be possessed during some ritual.  Alluding to the end of part 3, this concept is hardly followed up.  Toby, Robbie's invisible friend-poltergeist, is a mixed bag in this film.  The first two films seemed more like ""house"" movies in which ""things were simply happening to people"" as a result of ""something.""  Part three presented a poltergeist, a specific entity, which was actively ""doing things to people.""  In part four, we get a little of both, demonstrative of poor writing and rendering our ghost less credible.  The ""things"" that happen to Alex's family are less frequent, less scary and less interesting by far than in the other films.For whatever reason, the directors also used fewer subtle ""did you see that?"" moments when something moves or changes and if you blink you'd miss it.  Those moments were exciting in the earlier films.  All we get in this one is two moving objects, a broken chandelier and some swaying doors.  This movie actually felt boring compared to the rest of this engaging franchise.  Even the meant-to-be-shocking ending was a big ho-hum disappointment.Even if you're a fan of the franchise, you should probably just skip this.",1,Not scary. Not creepy. Not good.

1592273,A3F9VH8916IA40,B009AMALGM,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[0, 3]","...but this new film doesn't hold a candle to those movies.I remember watching the first Paranormal Activity back in 2009 in a crowded theater in San Antonio. Up until that time I'd never truly been scared by a movie before, except for with The Exorcist and even that wasn't all that scary. Paranormal Activity was the first movie to truly frighten me and cause me to lose sleep. The second film was much the same except much, much scarier. The third film, although it went in a different direction then the first, managed to breathe new life into the franchise and give us some unique and innovative techniques in order to deliver scares in a different manner than its predecessors.With the fourth installment of what is otherwise a great horror franchise the creators seem to have taken all the criticism from the first three movies to heart, specifically that there isn't enough action, it's too slow, and nothing really happens until the end. To compensate for all the haters, they decide for this film to go all in from the very beginning. No longer are we straining our eyes for multiple nights simply to see a door movie a LITTLE bit, or a shadow cross over the camera lens, or for the pool robot to climb out of the pool inexplicably. The agonizingly slow build up and extreme tension that made the first three films so great (for those of us that actually enjoyed them, that is) is replaced with a more upbeat, fast pace scare more reminiscent of mainstream horror films then its independent roots. Even for its two hour running time (approximately) the film seems rushed as it tries to cram in as many creepy scares as possible, all at the expense (in my opinion) of pacing and tension. I thought the first and second movie especially were extremely good for the very fact that they gave us so little to work with; a bump in the night, a squeaky door, a chandelier swaying ever so slightly or a pan falling from its rack. I'm not going to give away the scares in this movie, but I will say they aren't nearly as subtle as before.Another thing that somewhat lessened the scares in this movie was that it relied a lot on the people in the film to deliver the scares and not the ""entity"" from the first three. Sure, it makes its appearances and does its usual ""activities"" but to a much greater degree than in the first three it uses mere mortals to do its dirty work. I don't know about you, but no matter how scary you make someone's face look, it's not NEARLY as scary as some paranormal entity. That's not to say that ""Toby"" doesn't do his share, just to say that he goes to the bench way too often instead of stealing the show for himself. At the same time there was very little innovation with this film. The first movie took the POV angle and ran with it, the second film expanded it with more cameras, and the third gave us that great rotating camera work. Besides a nifty little trick with an Xbox Kinect there isn't really any innovation to speak of here. It's pretty much the second movie with computer camera's taking the place of security camera's, and a Kinect. Nothing special, nothing new, and nothing worth speaking of.This far into the franchise one would normally expect the series to be wrapped up by now, or at least to have some of the major questions answered. Unfortunately this film doesn't wrap up anything, instead it merely sets the stage for ANOTHER movie that will no doubt be coming out sometime next year. More questions (and really baffling ones at that) are raised by this movie then answered. Don't expect to find out what this coven is up to, what kind of deal they made, WHY exactly this entity wants Hunter and what it intends to do with him, or anything. Practically nothing is explained while more and more mystery is piled on us in order to make us watch the next movie. I don't want to be spoon fed answers like horror movies are want to do, but a little clarification would be nice. Just a LITTLE bit, no?On the plus side, the last ten to fifteen minutes of the movie are, as usual, very scary. Not AS scary as the finals for one, two, or three, but still scary. The characters aren't really all that great except for the two leads (Ben and Alex) were decently acted. The parents were nobodies throughout the entire movie, barely putting in any face time and only serving as cannon fodder for the entity and his minions. They seemed to merely fill in roles instead of playing actual characters. They might as well have been props.In conclusion I must say that this movie was a major letdown. I loved the first three films, with the second being my favorite, but the series has lost steam. If you're a Paranormal fan like myself then its worth a watch when it comes out on video, but definitely not anything worth speaking of.

1592275,A8PL5OAS7IWKR,B009AMALGM,Jonathan M. G. Wright,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed the original Paranormal Activity very much. I loved that it let your mind make things scary instead of just presenting ever more gore like most other horror movies do. I have come to realize over time though that the things that made the first one so scary were, in addition to only letting you see just enough to have you on the edge of your seat, its pacing and the mystery behind the whole thing - it was only in the second one that they actually tried to make a plot. The sheer visceral impact of it was terrifying if you watched it attentively and in a dark quiet room.The second one lost a lot of its scares by having many cameras, thus losing the limited perspective which helped keep your mind wondering what &#34;that shadow&#34; was that you may have just seen. 3 was a bit better since it went back to basics but the cat was already out of the bag. Knowing what to expect meant that we didn't care so much what that shadow was anymore.Now we have PA4. I will usually admit that scary movies are more scary to most people than they are to me since I have been watching them since I was 6 years old and have seen hundreds. In this case, however, I can honestly say that this is just not at all scary. Outright boring in fact. Not only is the cat still out of the bag in terms of story, plus we have many cameras again, but there really isn't anything actually happening here. That's right, not only little paranormal activity but little activity at all. None of the characters matter. Nothing they do matters. It is just people walking around, some shots of them sleeping, a very unnecessary XBOX Kinect endorsement, and really nothing to even tie it to the old story line in the end.I didn't expect much from it and I am sure you aren't either but if you are just looking for a horror to watch then go re-watch Alien or The Descent if you want to be scared, Evil Dead 2 if you want something silly and campy, or the Sixth Sense if you want something more dramatic and thoughtful.

Soon after the film opens a young boy named Robbie comes over and apparently his mother is in the hospital and he needs a place to stay as he has no other family to turn to. Well once Robbie gets to the house, odd things begin to happen, strange sounds, things seemingly paranormal shall we say, so Alex and her boyfriend set up computers with running video streaming to capture these hauntings.What follows is the usual bumps in the night, shadows around Alex and others in the house and then once Robbie's mother is back (Katie from the first two flicks), things pick up. The scares get amped up and the deaths are pretty well done especially those in the last 20-30 minutes, the closing sequence may not make too much sense to those uninitiated to the series (how did all those people fit in the backyard of a standard sized house comes to mind) but if you've seen the first 3 films it makes a lot more sense.I did enjoy this one, sure it doesn't really add a ton to the series in the end, but it actually was entertaining overall.

And that's a conceptual problem because it's the paranormal activity itself, which revolve around the neighbor's creepy kid, that is supposed to be the star of the show. Instead, since it usually happens at night when nearly everyone is asleep or in the day when hardly anyone is around, it brings the plot to a comparatively dreary slowdown. For that reason, the first half of the movie, which I think also features more close-ups of the cute daughter and her sexy mother, is better than the second half.marcellee.com",3,3 of 5,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,849,"['Cutesy', 'interaction', 'typical', 'American', 'family', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'movie', 'newest', 'series', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'edited', 'together', 'sets', 'private', 'Youtube-ready', 'videos', 'happen', 'catch', 'strange', 'ghostly', 'happenings', 'books', 'chairs', 'moving', 'conceptual', 'problem', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'revolve', 'neighbor', 'creepy', 'kid', 'supposed', 'be', 'star', 'show', 'Instead', 'usually', 'night', 'when', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'asleep', 'day', 'when', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'around', 'plot', 'comparatively', 'dreary', 'slowdown', 'reason', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'think', 'also', 'more', 'close-ups', 'cute', 'daughter', 'sexy', 'mother', 'better', 'second', 'half.marcellee.com']",N/A

It follows a teen named Alex who starts to feel that something has invaded their house since the arrival of her new neighboors. This neighbors (no surprise) are Katie and a weird kid named Robbie.This film felt like if the crew of this film just wanted to steal your money from you, it has no scares, you don't get to care for the characters (except for the boyfriend) and it doesn't even try to integrate something new for the franchise. The acting also was meh, the only good actors were the the boyfriend and the kids.But I had fun watching this on a cinema with a lot of people that were freaked out by this movie, therefore it gets 1 star.

I still think 3 is the scariest and best along with the original which was very good as well.Not sure if the actual movie or the DVD/Blu-Ray will have this but, the scariest scene from the trailer where she is on Facetime with her friend and that little boy Robby is standing outside in their driveway and she says what a creepy kid he is and then he looks up at her.  Then her room goes black and the alarm is going off saying front door open, side door open, back door open, and you see Katie (I think that was her name) standing in the room.

Daneker,"[0, 0]","The entire reason I kept watching past the first film was that the series was slowly developing a story and back-story that made each new one worth watching. Those involved in this simply made a film that ""looked"" like Paranormal Activity but really was not.Shame to. Finally we see what became of the Aunt and Hunter and it's a let down.SPOILERS:First of all, why on earth was the kidnapped boy put up for adoption? Where did the second boy come from? Why does the boy make funny things happen but never do anything?Well, my answer is this, the director seems so fixated on his 14 year old actress being in her skimpy sleep-shorts every chance possible that he forgets they are making a movie -- I started to wander just what fascination he had for this girl who is constantly in little shorts and at one point is levitated out of bed for absolutely no reason?Second, what's with all the hand-held camera work? Obviously these people don't walk around holding the camera out and making sure they film everything, yet that's what happens. The other three films knew the camera's had to be constantly explained and justified, this one doesn't care. I felt like the camera-man was the main character here.Third, where's the scary parts? The shape of the demon showing on the Xbox kinects dots should have been creepy and instilled dread, instead it was ... uh, whatever. My wife figured out that the kid was adopted and the neighbor kid was not hunter about five-minutes into the film, so when he starts screaming ""i'm not hunter"" but he is, we don't care.In the first three the little things the evil did seemed to be it pushing it's way through to our world and gaining strength and getting better and better at possession and killing, this time it's just the director moving props to try and startle us.The director should have just taken his actress and re-made Lolita, since the camera seems obsessed with her anyway. There's no logic to these camera's -- she's got a high-def night-vision camera rolling in perfect frame as she is being chased by a demon through a house trying to follow her being-dragged around father ... that makes sense? The only time the camera works is the one in living room that is stationary and when her smart-phone falls and keeps recording when she is locked in the garage -- the rest of the time we see how lazy the production is by not bothering to justify the footage. Plus, they show way too much when they show it and they re-use all the same tricks to no good effect.I'm sad to say there's no point in watching this.",3,Pointless,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,2555,"['entire', 'reason', 'kept', 'watching', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'slowly', 'developing', 'story', 'back-story', 'made', 'new', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'involved', 'simply', 'made', 'film', 'looked', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'really', 'was', 'not.Shame', 'Finally', 'see', 'what', 'became', 'Aunt', 'Hunter', 'let', 'down.SPOILERS', 'First', 'why', 'earth', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'boy', 'put', 'up', 'adoption', 'Where', 'did', 'second', 'boy', 'come', 'Why', 'boy', 'make', 'funny', 'things', 'happen', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'Well', 'answer', 'director', 'so', 'fixated', '14', 'year', 'old', 'actress', 'being', 'skimpy', 'sleep-shorts', 'chance', 'possible', 'are', 'making', 'movie', 'started', 'wander', 'just', 'what', 'fascination', 'had', 'girl', 'who', 'constantly', 'little', 'shorts', 'one', 'point', 'levitated', 'bed', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'Second', 'what', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'Obviously', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'holding', 'camera', 'making', 'sure', 'film', 'everything', 'what', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'knew', 'camera', 'had', 'be', 'constantly', 'explained', 'justified', 'one', ""n't"", 'care', 'felt', 'camera-man', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'here.Third', 'where', 'scary', 'parts', 'shape', 'demon', 'showing', 'Xbox', 'kinects', 'dots', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'creepy', 'instilled', 'dread', 'instead', 'was', 'uh', 'wife', 'figured', 'out', 'kid', 'was', 'adopted', 'neighbor', 'kid', 'was', 'not', 'hunter', 'five-minutes', 'film', 'so', 'when', 'screaming', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'hunter', 'do', ""n't"", 'care.In', 'first', 'three', 'little', 'things', 'evil', 'did', 'seemed', 'be', 'pushing', 'way', 'world', 'gaining', 'strength', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'possession', 'killing', 'time', 'just', 'director', 'moving', 'props', 'try', 'startle', 'us.The', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'taken', 'actress', 're-made', 'Lolita', 'camera', 'obsessed', 'anyway', 'logic', 'camera', 'got', 'high-def', 'night-vision', 'camera', 'rolling', 'perfect', 'frame', 'being', 'chased', 'demon', 'house', 'trying', 'follow', 'being-dragged', 'father', 'sense', 'only', 'time', 'camera', 'one', 'living', 'room', 'stationary', 'when', 'smart-phone', 'falls', 'keeps', 'recording', 'when', 'locked', 'garage', 'rest', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'lazy', 'production', 'not', 'bothering', 'justify', 'footage', 'show', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'show', 're-use', 'same', 'tricks', 'good', 'effect.I', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'point', 'watching']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","&#34;Paranormal Activity 4&#34; is a return to the franchise's continuity after flashing back to the sisters' origins in the third installment, who were the subject of &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; one and two.  We're back in the timeline to determine what happened to Hunter and Katie from the second film.But before we get that far, we see the terror of demonic possession through fresh eyes: attractive teenager Alex (Kathryn Newton) lives in Henderson, Nevada with mother Holly (Alexondra Lee), father Doug (Stephen Dunham), and little brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). Alex is fond of video chatting with her &#34;only a friend&#34; Ben (Matt Shively) who is smart enough to keep his mouth shut when Alex frequently shares video of herself in her underwear.When strange kid Robbie (Brady Allen) befriends next door neighbor Wyatt, things take a turn for the weird. Mysterious noises, telekinesis, and signs of witchcraft abound.  Or to put it another way, they don't call this &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; for nothing.The strangers across the street are up to no good, of course. Alex tries to get everyone to believe her, but since she's a teenager with an awful mom, this is a difficult thing to do.  One after another the people in her limited circle of family fail her, which eventually leads to a much broader conspiracy of witches.  It's a lot like the evolution of the &#34;Halloween&#34; series in which Michael Myers goes from lone psycho killer to a demonic sacrificing machine operating at the behest of a cult.The big twist in this film is technology, the use of Xbox 360's Kinect motion sensor to show ghosts (or not show them as the case may be). Much of the video recording is from a laptop's point of view, which would be later used successfully in the &#34;V/H/S&#34; series.Although not as thrilling as the first three installments, &#34;Paranormal Activity 4&#34; knows the right buttons to push to terrify parents of young children.

It's not one of the strongest entries in the series but, I still had spooky fun with it and the last act delivered the goods. I think there still is enough of what fans like about this series to entertain but, next entry better start cranking things up and taking risks. This entry opens up in 2011. A family in Nevada gets new neighbors across the street. A strange boy named Robbie (Brady Allen) and his single mom, Katie (Katie Featherston). When his mom is suddenly taken to the hospital, the family takes creepy Robbie in. Once there, teen Alex (Kathryn Newton) starts to notice strange occurrences as Robbie befriends her little brother, Wyatt (Aiden Lovecamp) and so she and boyfriend, Ben (Matt Shively) set up cameras and set the household laptops to record to get to the bottom of things that are going bump in the night...and day, too. Soon Alex begins to believe Robbie is not the only new occupant in the house. The first act seems to be a bit choppy and there are a few odd edits throughout and it is in act 1 in which the film has it's strongest feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu but, things start to pick up steam during the middle act and the movie really starts to click and become more it's own thing. Then the third act locks in and delivers the goods up to and including the spine-chilling climax. Sure, along the way there are some familiar elements but, you wouldn't remove Jason's hockey mask would you? There were enough new wrinkles in my book to keep things going, as well as, some subtle hints as to where the mythos might be headed. Not to mention a surprising reveal, too. The cast are all fine. The parents get the least screen time and character development but, the teens are likable, Wyatt is sweet and Robbie is very creepy. Series regular Katie Featherston gets a bigger role then early screenings suggested and without spoiling things, I liked how the character was used and Katie Featherston did a good job with her role. All in all there is some definite 'been there done that' but, I think fans will enjoy this entry enough to want more and that's what the filmmakers will have to deliver next time to keep this series going. It's time to really take some chances and give us something to really bite our nails over.

The found footage gimmick still works, but because we've seen this all before - three times before - the technique is starting to lose some of its power.  It doesn't help things when the character who sets up all the computers (it's computer cameras recording all the scares this time) has a harrowing near death experience that's all recorded - then doesn't watch the footage.So what's the point?Perhaps because this is the weakest of the 4 movies, the fact that we're never shown exactly who has found all this footage becomes a real letdown.  These films try their best to pretend that it's all real (no title sequence for instance), and that's all well and good - but seriously, 4 films in and we still don't know who's edited all this footage together and put titles on it?  This, plus barely moving the actual storyline ahead a wink, left me wondering what was the point of this film other then making a fast buck?  I mean, we get it - there's a demon/ghost about and a coven of witches that has summoned it - but what's their ultimate goal (other then daring the fools who record all the footage to put it on youtube); why are they risking possible exposure by killing a well to do family in an upscale neighborhood?  What's the grand plan?  PARANORMAL 4 gives us not a clue.Ironic as the poster claims that ""All the activity has led to this.""It's the repetitive nature of this film and near total lack of new story that kills any real power to scare.  In fact all most all the scares are of the cheap shock variety, not close to the hair raising terror the other 3 movies possessed.  Why not have the new victims be poor or black or English?  Anything else other then yet another yuppie white family living in a giant mansion with a huge staircase in the Southwest.  While 5 promises a change of pace, it comes one movie too late.BOTTOM LINE: 3 now I want a Xbox Kinect too out of 5 stars",3,"No new scares, but still kinda scary",1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2268,"['4th', 'film', 'PARANAORNAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'series', ""n't"", 'quite', 'yet', 'jumped', 'shark', 'producers', 'should', 'think', 'strongly', 'moving', 'story', 'significantly', 'forward', '5', 'want', 'keep', 'milking', 'cash', 'cow.Basically', '4', 'remake', '3', 'different', 'family', 'Xbox', 'Kinect', 'seriously', 'movie', 'nearly', 'infomercial', 'wireless', 'game', 'system', 'found', 'footage', 'gimmick', 'still', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'technique', 'starting', 'lose', 'power', ""n't"", 'help', 'things', 'when', 'character', 'who', 'up', 'computers', 'computer', 'cameras', 'recording', 'scares', 'time', 'harrowing', 'death', 'experience', 'recorded', 'then', ""n't"", 'watch', 'footage.So', 'what', 'point', 'Perhaps', 'weakest', '4', 'movies', 'fact', ""'re"", 'never', 'shown', 'exactly', 'who', 'found', 'footage', 'real', 'letdown', 'films', 'try', 'best', 'pretend', 'real', 'title', 'sequence', 'instance', 'well', 'good', 'seriously', '4', 'films', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'edited', 'footage', 'together', 'put', 'titles', 'barely', 'moving', 'actual', 'storyline', 'ahead', 'wink', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'film', 'other', 'then', 'making', 'fast', 'buck', 'mean', 'get', 'demon/ghost', 'coven', 'witches', 'summoned', 'what', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'other', 'then', 'daring', 'fools', 'who', 'record', 'footage', 'put', 'youtube', 'why', 'are', 'risking', 'possible', 'exposure', 'killing', 'well', 'do', 'family', 'upscale', 'neighborhood', 'What', 'grand', 'plan', '4', 'not', 'clue.Ironic', 'poster', 'activity', 'led', 'repetitive', 'nature', 'film', 'total', 'lack', 'new', 'story', 'real', 'power', 'scare', 'fact', 'most', 'scares', 'are', 'cheap', 'shock', 'variety', 'not', 'close', 'hair', 'raising', 'terror', 'other', '3', 'movies', 'possessed', 'Why', 'not', 'have', 'new', 'victims', 'be', 'poor', 'black', 'English', 'Anything', 'else', 'other', 'then', 'yet', 'yuppie', 'white', 'family', 'living', 'giant', 'mansion', 'huge', 'staircase', 'Southwest', '5', 'promises', 'change', 'pace', 'one', 'movie', 'too', 'late.BOTTOM', 'LINE', '3', 'now', 'want', 'Xbox', 'Kinect', 'too', 'out', '5', 'stars']",N/A

1592326,A39W3263A9HCMN,B009AMALGM,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[5, 9]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***If horror franchise history 101 has taught me one thing, it's that usually the franchises start getting long in the tooth after the third movie. The only franchise I've seen an exception with that was the Friday the 13th series, where part IV was where the series became watchable. And be it no surprise that something like Paranormal Activity is something that manages to rake in money with every installment every year. The series before it that held the same claim to fame was the Saw franchise. And what do both of these have in common? Both peaked at the third movie. Sadly, Paranormal Activity is quickly becoming the new Saw franchise, something I've feared since before the second movie came out.Yet, in a way, it makes more sense to drag the Paranormal franchise out than the Saw franchise. With Saw, Jigsaw died in the third movie, and we got a bunch of ridiculous whodunits, all amounting to some silly twist that read like a fanfic, with Dr. Gordon filling in for Jigsaw. Here, there hasn't been any silly twists, since the series has made things more apparent with every movie about the origin of the demon, and even the idea of a satanic cult was interesting. I liked it when they brought it up in the third movie. Problem is, we're on the fourth movie in the series now and really nothing has been done with it. I mean, yes, I could complain that the movie has repeated the same formula over and over again, but more on that later.Having broken out of the sequel with a prequel formula, Paranormal 4 starts with a scene near the end of the second movie, where Katie and Hunter are sitting with Kristi by the side of the backyard pool, and she gives him a bracelet. Then a series of obligatory title cards, in the same typewriter font as the previous movies, explain what has happened so far. Right, as if we, the people who saw every movie in the series, needs to be explained to why and what happened. Then, we get the ending of the second movie, with Katie killing Kristi, running off with Hunter, and maybe a 2 second shot that's completely new, where Katie walks out of the house with Hunter, and that same title card explaining how their whereabouts remain unknown. Already we're 3 minutes into the movie and we haven't got any new material... is the series really this out of ideas?Anyways. We go to November 2011, in Henderson, Nevada. We're focused on a new family, whose last name for some reason remains unknown. The mom and dad haven't talked to each other a lot lately, and are on the verge of divorce. The daughter is a very beautiful and happy 15 year old with a cool boyfriend, who may be the only interesting character in this movie. Furthermore, they have an adopted 6-year-old named Wyatt, who's parents remain unknown. They've been receiving mysterious visits from a creepy kid named Robbie, including an unwelcome visit in the family treehouse, and when an accident happens with his mom, he is forced to stay three days at their house. The boyfriend of Alex, the daughter, points out that the XBOX Kinect projects dots that are only visible on night vision video cams, that track movement. This was a gimmick I was hoping would work, kinda like the oscillating fan in the third movie, but sadly, it only served useful maybe once.And so in the first night of his staying there, Alex hears a noise downstairs at 3 AM, and finds Robbie standing creepily in front of the Kinect. Some mysterious ghost, who runs behind him and shakes the house, appears, and this compels the boyfriend, who is tech savvy, to set up the family's laptops in places around the house, and leave them open, as apparently they can record video even when they're turned off. This was something else I was hoping would do some good, but really, it didn't.So, really nothing happens for this time period, but for a few things. One unexpected (but not really scary) moment is when a chandelier mysteriously drops from the ceiling, and Alex, holding the camera, pans the camera up to find Robbie sitting there, watching and staring in silence. Another moment is when a knife manages to disappear in one scene, and then, in another scene, falls down in front of the camera, startling the dad in the family. And there's Katie's appearances, which are good fun and Featherston, as expected, turns in a great performance as Ktie who is now completely possessed by the demon. There's one good jump scare in the scene at the end, where Alex finds a demonic coven, then turns to find Demonic Katie launching for her. Mind you, we had to sit through 80 minutes of same old same old to get to that part, which is never a good sign.By this point, it should become blazingly obvious what happens, even if you haven't seen the first four movies. Which is the problem- this movie is one big, long prologue into the fifth movie. Nothing is done to advance the films plot, and by that, I mean NOTHING. Even Katie's appearances and the twist ending involving Wyatt, do absolutely nothing to further the movie's plot.So maybe the movie really isn't as bad as I may make it sound. It's an OKAY film, if you're a die-hard fan if the series. I'll admit, I have seen worse. But since we've gotten four movies into the franchise, two being done by Henry Joost and Ariel Schumann, who both did a great job with the third movie (many because they had some documentary experience with fan favourite ""Catfish"", which got lots of praise from critics and audience alike), and using the same formula, Oren Peli seems to not know where he's going with this series. Hell, the formula from the third movie is repeated here. And believe me, it's an even more stale version of the ending from Paranormal 3. In fact, I kid you not, as soon as the credits came up, the audience booed at the film. That's a definite clue that the series has nowhere to go but forward, with the same formula under its belt, but even less scares than the original. Furthermore, the series has even sunk to the level of using jump scares and CG. the low budget first movie had one jump scare and no CG, 2 and 3 had maybe 2 or 3 with a small dash of CG. CG is everywhere in this movie and it's unintentionally hilarious (does Tobey REALLY look like an alien?)From an acting standpoint, the film isn't bad per se. Katie Featherston is predictably great, and the boyfriend is great too. Reading his IMDb bio, I noticed that he's been in theatre since the fourth grade, just like me. So its definitely not a surprise he can act. From an aesthetic standpoint is where the movie fails. I saw the movie in IMAX, and it's baffling why it even got an IMAX release. Alright, the sound was great but more on that later. The movie's shots can be divided into two categories: fuzzy, webcam style shots and shots of Alex's face. And Alex is a pretty girl and all, but we don't get enough of her parents either, which is a rarity for the franchise. From the third movie, Dennis was a fun character and the mother was funny, though bitchy. And the mother and father here uninteresting because WE SEE SO LITTLE OF THEM.It's worth a note that Robbie isn't all that scary either. Kids get a bad rap In horror movies nowadays and it's not hard to figure out why. Robbie is kinda creepy in his first appearance in the tree house, but after that he isn't creepy at all. He confuses creepy stares with bored droning facial expressions, and seems like a little kid who is crabby because he can't get that toy he wants.So, finally, a word to Oren Peli. Stop this madness now! LET THIS THING DIE HERE. And perhaps fire the screenwriter, Christopher Landon, with it. Or at least find someone who can do something with Paranormal 5, since it hasn't even been two days since the movie came out and already you have announced the fifth movie. I'm sure super special edition 4 disc directors cut blu-ray release with a holographic slipcase cover and a ticket to Paranormal Activity 5 will have all the special deleted scenes and alternate endings, but at this point, I don't even care anymore. This movie is by no means a classic, and while I may have seen worse, it's only a matter of time before this franchise devolved even further into Saw-itude.",1,Stop this madness now!,1351036800,"10

They kept on showing the commercials afterwards too. But, this? This one didn't have anything, but a poster in theaters. Not a single commercial for it!

The third one only had one or two moments that worked.But the fourth one is starting to drag it all down.  Introducing new characters (neighbors to Katie and Hunter) didn't further the storyline at all.  Just as PA3 didn't move it forward (since it was set in the past before PA and PA2), PA4 didn't move anything forward and it was AFTER everything.I know there will be PA5 come this Halloween, and why not?

However, the producers in their wisdom have decided if they can cut off more heads with bad camera angles and implore worse sound they might still convince us of the reality of this film. If you go on U-Tube or watch the amateur submissions to some America's video TV show, you will see that we are better photographers than this series makes us out to be.In the beginning, Hunter is kidnapped as an infant. We then jump to 5 years later. The film starts out mostly of a young male filming a teen female (Kathryn Newton). She has a younger brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). When Robbie (Brady Allen)the creepy young boy next door shows up with his imaginary friend weird things begin to happen. Alex, our teen girl allows the young man (Matt Shively) to set up cameras around the house to film the weird things that are going on and to cut off everyone's head. While weird things were caught on camera, they never went back to view the films which was the whole purpose of setting up the cameras in the first place.Special effects, and by by ""special"" I mean ride the short bus special, included the chandelier moving, doors opening, chairs moving, covers coming off, and a bad levitation scene. No pool crawler getting out of the pool by itself.This was by far the least of the series. If you were a big fan of the other three, you might find enjoyment in this one as this is upgraded to color. These films are cheap to make and pay for themselves in the opening weekend. Don't expect the franchise to go away anytime soon.

My review is basically a review of this movies entertainment value of which it has none.The use of documentary style camera with dates is totally useless in this movie. You are made to think that this movie shows captured images from paranormal activity investigator cameras. But it doesn't work because this movie is not about a paranormal activity being investigated by professional investigators. They do not exist in this movie. So why do they even bother with this effect?This movie is basically a mishmash of events that do not help to move the story (if you can call it that) along. The plot plods along with no real build up that you come to expect with horror movies. This movie could have been encapsulated in a fifteen minute span and still get the same result.This movie is actually boring and I kept on watching it as I waited for it to get better. And it never did. The disappointing ending which I thought did not make sense. It was simply thrown in for sudden shock effect which did not work because of the lack of build up. This reminds me of something right out of a YouTube video that will pop off a sudden growling monster out of nowhere just for a laugh. It's not scary. It's just shocking. But in this movie's case, it is just totally disappointing.I get the sense that this movie was a simple cash-in on the movie series. I don't know if this movie was shown in theaters but if it was, I can only imagine how angry the movie goer must have felt after sitting through this garbage. I am glad that I did not purchase the dvd version of this movie and simply watched it on Netflix. I could have written a much better movie to call Paranormal Activity 4 than this.

I found part one genuinely scary and while not as good, I still liked part two. But something started to go wrong with part 3. The whole retcon with this Toby character, mythology from the first two parts ignored, and the stereotypical Satanic coven were just the worst. Not to mention, the trailer for 3-which contained almost no footage from the actual movie-looked like a much better film.With all of that, I was looking side-eyes at part 4, but I gave in and rented it anyway. For this entry, we are back in the present with a new family in Henderson, Nevada. We are reminded pointedly in the prologue that Katie and little Hunter from part 2 are still missing. There is a creepy little boy and his never seen mother next door. This mysterious mother gets sick and asks the new family to care for creepy kid while she's in the hospital. And things get weird.If you've seen any of these films, you know the drill. Unexplained bumps in the night (and day) lead to levitating objects and eventually people. Long sequences of watching a person sleep or read or whatever are suddenly punctuated by jump scares. Even in part 3, these long sequences had occasional payoffs. While I wasn't a particular fan of that entry, there were a few scary scenes I rewound and watched again. Alas, I can't imagine anyone being frightened by this uninspired entry. Toby's actions this time are largely pointless and lame until the very end (and even then, I couldn't bring myself to be very interested.) Not to mention, the story just doesn't make much sense and it seems to contravene its own mythology. Which, given that we are at part 4 now, isn't that surprising, I guess. What exactly is ""Toby"" trying to accomplish at this point anyway?And just like in part 3, hardly anything from the trailer was in the movie and once again, the trailer scenes look better. Although I doubt even the trailer scenes could save this.What I did like were the actors, particularly the ones playing the teenage girl and her would-be boyfriend (Kathryn Newton and Matt Shively.) The child actor playing Robbie is convincingly creepy. Inevitably, they've announced a part 5 and a Latin spin-off.

Instead of directly following their story, ""Paranormal Activity 4"" shifts the viewpoint, centering on an ordinary family the Nelsons happily living in Henderson, Nevada. They start experiencing weird things after someone moved into a house across the street. This is not a bad idea for a sequel, and there are certainly a few scares, but all in all the fourth entry of ""Paranormal Activity"" is more silly than scary.As you know, everything is shot in a ""found footage"" style, trademark of this franchise. In ""Paranormal Activity 4,"" a high school girl Alex Nelson (Kathryn Newton) and her friend Ben (Matt Shively) record strange occurrences in the house, using laptop computers. They also frequently chat via webcam. The latest entry's story is set in 2011.They may employ new video recording devices, but it seems the filmmakers have used up ideas to scare the viewers. I think most of us are now accustomed to sudden loud noises and things popping out. It is the easiest way to scare people, and it works, well, maybe for the first twenty minutes. Then it gets repetitious and predictable, especially when the film has virtually no story to tell.Strangely, neither Alex nor Ben is really interested in checking the recorded images that would show (and do show to us) what is going on in the house. OK, maybe files did not open (so conveniently), but even so, there are still so many creepy events that happen to the unsuspecting characters. If ""that thing"" should fall from above right in front of me in my house, I would immediately run away and move out.But they don't. OK, I know, this is a film, not reality.

I will go in order of the time line of them. So starting with number 3. I liked it. Really liked it. I liked the dust falling on Tobi and the crazy girl cult and how they made it a prequel. Same formula they had in here they had in all of them though.Number 1. I will say I loved number 1. It reintroduced what a horror movie actually is. The horror movies today are more gore factor thus I have dubbed them Gorror movies. Dont care for those anymore. Why grosse me out when I want a thrill from a good scare. But thats just me. Anywho, this movie pretty much has the same formula that halloween had. Nothing happens for a long time until the end. Tid bits happen here and there but pretty much nothing happens until the end. Just like in Halloween. However in todays movies we dont often like that formula as much. But for the start of a film series, this was a delight. Original in it's own way with the cool parlor tricks and 15,000 dollar budget and I have no choice but to give the original Director props but it still has the exact same formula as halloween.Number 2 was a prequel with like 2 scenes of a sequal to number 1. This had the same formula as well but with Katie's Sister and her family. Didnt matter who it was but it was the same formula that started to bore me. Oh, but get this. The entire family dies and Katie takes hunter. I get it. The demon has come back because of the grandma who made a deal with it for the first male in the family. Okay. Cool. So Katie-Tobi demon has Hunter the first born male in a generation or whatever....Now for the twist.Number 4. Before I get to the twist, again it was the same formula but a different family. Yawn. Lets throw in alittle confusion now. Hunter was put up for adoption to get kidnapped by katie again who had another demon child try  and succeed in getting him possessed or join the Girly cult demon worshippers. I get that number 3 was good by adding the cult. That was kinda creepy and a good addition. But now it was blown up into a whole army of demon possessed girl cult people...Sorry. I was still trying to figure out why Katie or tobi or whatever would still put up Hunter for adoption just to kidnap them again later. It doesnt make sense.So in conclusion these movies for me are 2/4 for the 4 movies. I liked 2 of them. But didnt like the other 2. I still think it would have been better if they had Hunter possessed by Tobi recruit from another family to satisfy its hunger for the babies or girls or whatever crazy demon pimp it is. Not going to buy this one sadly. Even if katie went beast mode on me.

1592380,A1QF10TB8AYTA3,B009AMALGM,"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja""","[1, 3]","So, I've watched many of the Paranormal Activities. I've seen number 1, and number 2 in the theater. Number 1 because I thought this was going to be a scary movie. Number 2 because I was disappointed in 1 and thought that maybe they learned to make a scary movie (wrong again), and 3 because it's playing on cable.So why did I watch 4? Because it was free on Amazon Prime, and now that I've seen it, don't waste your time with this terrible movie.Let's get into the nitty gritty of why you should skip this one.For starters, I don't get the fans of Paranormal Activity. If you're following it for the story, why do you care about these characters? There's absolutely nothing that makes me as a watcher want to root for any of these people. Nor is there anything truly scary about these films.Let's sum up what PA4 is all about.Fake suspense, anti-climax, repetition, fake suspense, anti-climax, repetition, terrible ending.Fake suspense:The movie is full of jump scares that are nothing. A cat jumps next to the camera. The friend scares the girl. Someone appears who was out of frame. Instead of making the jump scares have anything to do with the actual ghost and or &#34;demon&#34; it tries to scare the audience with the mundane.Another scene which I thought was going to be awesome and redeem this movie, was when the knife flew up to the ceiling while the mom wasn't looking. This scene alone would have been the perfect opportunity for the knife to: A.) Drop on top of her head and kill her. B.) Drop down and cut her arm. C.) Drop down and have her miss being cut.You know what happens when the knife goes up to the ceiling?NOTHING! It cuts to the next scene and continues on from there.Does the knife eventually drop down? Yes, when the dad is far away and there is absolutely no danger of the knife hitting him.Which brings us to Anti-Climax.Everything that happens in this movie is anti-climactic. It's called PARANORMAL Activity right? Well, when that terrible actress Kate shows up, she's pretty much the one that kills off the characters. Let's see... and yes this is spoilers because you shouldn't watch this boring ass movie.The mom is floated up to the ceiling and then dropped. Wow, what a kill.The friend has his neck broken by Kate. Oooh, that hasn't been done before!The father gets dragged into a room and just disappears, so we just have to presume he's dead.and the girl gets killed by an army of demon women. Okay, that part was... kind of interesting? Except it was the same way the killed off the other characters in PA2. The only difference is that the women were witches.Oh, repetition, right forgot to cover that. Well basically the movie repeats with showing you a whole lot of NOTHING happening for long stretches of time. Then something barely scary happens, cut to some dialogue and &#34;Oh my God there's ghosts in the house&#34; and then another shot of a long stretch of nothing happening and... OH MAN! A LOUD NOISE! WHAT COULD IT BE!?It's a real shame too, I actually kind of liked the actors that were in this one. The family felt very believable and realistic. I could totally imagining these people being real. Maybe I'm out of touch, but I thought they did an admirable job. (Except for Kate, she was terrible in the first and is still terrible now.)So if you're bored and you have access to this movie for free whether on Cable, Netflix, Amazon Prime.Do yourself a favor, watch a GOOD movie and skip this moronic piece of trash.(Blonde girl was great though, she needs better films.)",1,This movie is so... stupid.,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,3527,"['So', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'Paranormal', 'Activities', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', '1', 'number', '2', 'theater', 'Number', '1', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'scary', 'movie', 'Number', '2', 'was', 'disappointed', '1', 'thought', 'maybe', 'learned', 'make', 'scary', 'movie', 'wrong', 'again', '3', 'playing', 'cable.So', 'why', 'did', 'watch', '4', 'was', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'terrible', 'movie.Let', 'get', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'why', 'should', 'skip', 'one.For', 'starters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'fans', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', ""'re"", 'following', 'story', 'why', 'do', 'care', 'characters', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'watcher', 'want', 'root', 'people', 'there', 'anything', 'truly', 'scary', 'films.Let', 'sum', 'up', 'what', 'PA4', 'about.Fake', 'suspense', 'anti-climax', 'repetition', 'fake', 'suspense', 'anti-climax', 'repetition', 'terrible', 'ending.Fake', 'suspense', 'movie', 'full', 'jump', 'scares', 'are', 'nothing', 'cat', 'next', 'camera', 'friend', 'girl', 'Someone', 'who', 'was', 'frame', 'Instead', 'making', 'jump', 'scares', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'actual', 'ghost', '34', 'demon', '34', 'scare', 'audience', 'mundane.Another', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'awesome', 'redeem', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'knife', 'flew', 'up', 'ceiling', 'mom', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'scene', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'knife', 'Drop', 'top', 'head', 'kill', 'B', 'Drop', 'down', 'cut', 'arm', 'C.', 'Drop', 'down', 'have', 'miss', 'being', 'cut.You', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'knife', 'up', 'ceiling', 'NOTHING', 'next', 'scene', 'knife', 'eventually', 'drop', 'down', 'Yes', 'when', 'dad', 'far', 'away', 'absolutely', 'danger', 'knife', 'hitting', 'him.Which', 'brings', 'Anti-Climax.Everything', 'movie', 'anti-climactic', 'called', 'PARANORMAL', 'Activity', 'right', 'Well', 'when', 'terrible', 'actress', 'Kate', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'characters', 'Let', 'see', 'yes', 'spoilers', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'boring', 'ass', 'movie.The', 'mom', 'floated', 'ceiling', 'then', 'dropped', 'Wow', 'what', 'kill.The', 'friend', 'neck', 'broken', 'Kate', 'Oooh', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'father', 'dragged', 'room', 'just', 'disappears', 'just', 'have', 'presume', 'dead.and', 'girl', 'killed', 'army', 'demon', 'women', 'Okay', 'part', 'was', 'kind', 'interesting', 'was', 'same', 'way', 'killed', 'off', 'other', 'characters', 'PA2', 'only', 'difference', 'women', 'were', 'witches.Oh', 'repetition', 'right', 'forgot', 'cover', 'Well', 'basically', 'movie', 'showing', 'whole', 'lot', 'NOTHING', 'happening', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'Then', 'something', 'barely', 'scary', 'happens', 'cut', 'dialogue', '34', 'Oh', 'God', 'ghosts', 'house', '34', 'then', 'shot', 'long', 'stretch', 'nothing', 'happening', 'OH', 'MAN', 'A', 'LOUD', 'NOISE', 'WHAT', 'COULD', 'IT', 'BE', 'real', 'shame', 'too', 'actually', 'kind', 'liked', 'actors', 'were', 'one', 'family', 'felt', 'very', 'believable', 'realistic', 'could', 'totally', 'imagining', 'people', 'being', 'real', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'touch', 'thought', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'Kate', 'was', 'terrible', 'first', 'still', 'terrible', 'now', 'So', ""'re"", 'bored', 'have', 'access', 'movie', 'free', 'Cable', 'Netflix', 'Amazon', 'Prime.Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'skip', 'moronic', 'piece', 'trash', 'Blonde', 'girl', 'was', 'great', 'better', 'films']",N/A

A cat jumping into frame to scare me is not scary.  A girl flopping on her bed to scare me is not scary.  A mom opening the garage door and carrying in groceries is not scary.  A basketball bouncing down the stairs?  Just stupid.  And the thing with the kid riding around on his big wheel just reminded me I could be watching The Shining instead of this thing.Plus an internet reviewer pointed something out to me that I didn't even think of.  Why was Katie taken to the hospital in the first place?  We never find out.  Also, when she came back she looked fine.  She didn't have a place on her arm where they could have put an IV in, she didn't look lethargic from anesthetics, she didn't have a hospital ID bracelet on, etc.  So what the heck was she doing at the hospital?  Some clarity would be nice.Also, the movie is pretty much one big commercial for Apple products and the Xbox Kinect.  Because EVERYONE in this movie has an Apple laptop, or an iPhone, and we are shown people playing Kinect and those weird tracking dots from the Kinect are shown EVERY friggin' night!Another thing that bothered me was the fact that these parents have to be the dumbest parents on the planet!  When clearly supernatural activity is shown to them, they completely ignore it.  It's almost like they stick their fingers in their ears, close their eyes and go, ""LA LA LA LA LA, I can't hear you!""  I mean you have to actively TRY in order to be this oblivious to things!***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***I will admit that the extended version of the film is good and I really enjoyed the extra little tidbits that it had to show us.Honestly it feels like they just made this film as an afterthought or an attempt to cash in on the franchise.

This film should never have been made and they should have just have left the series with three films.",2,Series is Losing Steam,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,2467,"['loved', 'original', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'sequel', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'third', 'one', 'was', 'kinda', 'scary', 'also', 'helped', 'give', 'little', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'whole', 'demon', 'witch', 'coven', 'thing.This', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'just', 'lame', 'kinda', 'had', 'things', 'other', 'films', 'had', 'whole', 'Night', 'X', 'then', 'date', 'had', 'few', 'creepy', 'things', 'happening', '***SPOILERS***', '***SPOILERS***', '***SPOILERS***But', 'jump', 'scares', 'oh', 'jump', 'cat', 'jumping', 'frame', 'scare', 'not', 'scary', 'girl', 'flopping', 'bed', 'scare', 'not', 'scary', 'mom', 'opening', 'garage', 'door', 'carrying', 'groceries', 'not', 'scary', 'basketball', 'bouncing', 'down', 'stairs', 'Just', 'stupid', 'thing', 'kid', 'riding', 'around', 'big', 'wheel', 'just', 'reminded', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'Shining', 'instead', 'thing.Plus', 'internet', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'Why', 'was', 'Katie', 'taken', 'hospital', 'first', 'place', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'Also', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'looked', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'place', 'arm', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'IV', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'lethargic', 'anesthetics', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'hospital', 'ID', 'bracelet', 'etc', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'doing', 'hospital', 'clarity', 'would', 'be', 'nice.Also', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'big', 'commercial', 'Apple', 'products', 'Xbox', 'Kinect', 'EVERYONE', 'movie', 'Apple', 'laptop', 'iPhone', 'are', 'shown', 'people', 'playing', 'Kinect', 'weird', 'tracking', 'dots', 'Kinect', 'are', 'shown', 'EVERY', 'friggin', 'night', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'fact', 'parents', 'have', 'be', 'dumbest', 'parents', 'planet', 'When', 'clearly', 'supernatural', 'activity', 'shown', 'completely', 'ignore', 'almost', 'stick', 'fingers', 'ears', 'close', 'eyes', 'go', 'LA', 'LA', 'LA', 'LA', 'LA', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'mean', 'have', 'actively', 'TRY', 'order', 'be', 'oblivious', 'things', '***END', 'SPOILERS***', '***END', 'SPOILERS***', '***END', 'SPOILERS***I', 'will', 'admit', 'extended', 'version', 'film', 'good', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'extra', 'little', 'tidbits', 'had', 'show', 'us.Honestly', 'just', 'made', 'film', 'afterthought', 'attempt', 'cash', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'storyline', 'give', 'anymore', 'background', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'have', 'left', 'series', 'three', 'films']",N/A
