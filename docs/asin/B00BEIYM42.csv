Gemma Arterton, Christopher Eccleston surely deserve their place on the mantle, but this film is about these four actors.Two other things about the film of note:Gemma Arterton - This classically beautiful British girl is in top form here. Speaking of which, do yourself a treat and check her out in the tragically under-watchedTamara Drewe.Box Office - 'Song' only made $1.7m in US domestic box office.  That's a shame.

1629969,A9I40WFF40R4,B00BEIYM42,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[14, 15]","What a joy it is to see consummate actors of the calibre of Vanessa Redgrave and Terence Stamp on the big screen. And while they may not be the youthful handsome and beautiful actors we remember from ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" and ""Camelot,"" they remind us that, yes, there is still a beauty in old age. (Watching this film, I was reminded that the great photographer Imogene Cunningham published near the end of her life-- I believe she was at least 90-- beautiful photographs of old people.)Stamp as Arthur and Redgrave as his wife Marion play two characters in the twilight of their lives and are in a word, brilliant. But Gemma Arterton as Elizabeth, the music teacher, and Christopher Eccleston as Arthur and Marion's son James give outstanding performances as well. (The tension between Arthur and his son James is palpable. And the friendship that develops between the old Arthur and the young Elizabeth is one of the pluses of the film.) The plot is simple and could have been washed out to the British sea by a lesser director (Paul Andrew Williams directs) and less than stellar acting as the actors carry the film. (Elizabeth gets a group of seniors ready to perform heavy metal music for a contest.)I went to see this movie with some trepidation since the rumors I had heard were that it was a tearjerker and I had heard the words ""too sentimental"" bandied about. I worried in vain. Of course there are sad moments in this movie-- to experience Terence Stamp singing Billy Joel's ""Llullabye (Goodnight, my Angel)"" will make you tear up and is worth the price of admission to the movie-- but there are scenes that will make your smile as well. According to the MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY, the definition of ""sentimental"" is (a)""marked or governed by feeling"" and (b) ""resulting from feeling rather than reason."" Isn't this why we weep at funerals and feel overwhelming sadness when sons and daughters go off to fight in foreign lands? It is all about being human.

Marion attends the local community center to sing in a choir of similar seniors. Then one day Marion collapses and we learn that she has terminal cancer (the doctor tells her ""eat all the chips and ice cream you want!""). In a parallel storyline, we see Arthur also struggling mightly in his relationship with his son Steve and 8 yr. old granddaughter Jennifer. Meanwhile, the choir, lead by a young woman named Elizabeth (played by Gemma Arterton), is getting ready for the singing competition they have entered. At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie. How will things turn out for Marion and Arthur? Can Arthur mend the fences with his son? Will the choir break through in the singing competition? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turs out.Several comments: first and foremost, I was struck by the similarities in themes between this movie and ""Quartet"", the Dustin Hoffman-directed British movie from late last year: the soothing, if not healing, powers of both music and companionship for elderly folks. Second, you will see a side of Vanessa Redgrave that you have not seen before (not to mention that Redgrave, now in her mid-70s, remains as active as ever). Third, THE break-out performance of the movie for me is Gemma Arterton, who reminds me of a British version of Anna Kendrick. Arterton is an up-and-coming talent, the last of which we have not yet seen (she was most recently in ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" and later this year she'll be in ""Byzantium"").The screening I saw this at here in my local art-house theatre in Cincinnati this weekend was packed, heavily tilting towards seniors, I might add, and they absolutely loved this movie, laughing out loud many time (for example, when the choir started doing the 'robot dance') and even giving an applause as the end credits started to roll.

With the other UK films of baby boomers already seen, this is a bit redundant. That said, the performances by Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave make up for any lessing.Marion, played by Vanessa Redgrave, has a terminal disease and intends to live her life fully. Her husband, Arthur, as played by Terence Stamp, has always been stoic, no fun, Arthur. Marion is the only one who seems to understand Arthur. Marion loves to sing with her pensioner's group, her friends are there. Arthur drops her by and then leaves or stays outside and smokes. He cares for her, all by himself, he wants to do the controlling. They have a son and a granddaughter, but Arthur never seemed to get on with the boy. As time goes by we get to know the members of the choir, and the young woman leading it. This is a story well told, but it does fall into the dramatic fold. However, I wouldn't really know because tears were streaming.A lovely British film with a lot to say. It has been said before and is not new, that is why I assume the film did not hit the big time. But for those of us who enjoy these films, it is a winner. I loved the cast, recognize a few faces in the choir, and would love to see this turned into a series.

1629981,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00BEIYM42,Russell Fanelli,"[2, 3]","The great Vanessa Redgrave heads an outstanding cast in this sad story of two elderly people coming to terms with death and dying.  Vanessa is wonderful as Marion, sick and dying, but determined to live her life to the fullest until the end.  She is part of a chorus of elderly people at a senior center who are preparing to enter a competition.  Her group is led by the young and enthusiastic Gemma Atherton, Elizabeth in the film.  Marion's husband Arthur, again in another fine performance by Terrence Stamp, is a bit of a curmudgeon.  Arthur sings quite well himself, but would prefer to hide his talent and instead stands sternly in the background watching Marion and the chorus.At home Arthur cares tenderly for Marion as we watch her slow decline.  She never gives in to her illness or gives up living as fully as she can.  The great power of this film is that we quickly come to care for Marion and Arthur.  They are good people who have been dealt a difficult hand and they play it as best they can.  At first come our tears when the inevitable happens to Marion, but then we watch with joy as Arthur learns how to resume living.  Encouraged by director Gemma, who hears him sing and recognizes his talent, Arthur joins the chorus.Some will say that the ending is predictable, but I didn't care.  I cheered for Arthur and was happy for him as he put his life back together after a devastating loss.  The story starts out as an ""Unfinished Song;"" Marion did not get a chance to be with her mates at the chorus competition.  But when Arthur is standing on stage singing his heart out, we know that this story ends with hope and courage.  Yes, death claims everyone in the end, but as Marion would say, it is how we live each day that counts -- never, never giving up.  Laughter and tears, hope and despair, life and death are all part of the ""unfinished song"" that is everyone's life.

Utilizing music and melodrama in such a way that is never overwrought or exaggerated for effect, Unfinished Song is mild entertainment which creeps up on you in profoundly unexpected ways. Even the supporting characters feel very natural, making it very difficult to notice when anyone is ""acting.""Terence Stamp heads up the cast as Arthur, a cranky old man who has become accustomed to his habits and routines with the only person he opens up to, his wife (Vanessa Redgrave). When cancer threatens to take that foundation from Arthur, she suddenly joins an elderly singing group. Arthur is pulled into the group, finding solace in the friendship of the group's young teacher, Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton). Unfinished Song is a film about grief, but manages to keep a light touch on the material.The music in Unfinished Song is simple but effective, never appearing too polished or unbelievable. There is more heart than talent in the voices, but that works wonders for the sincerity of the film's story. We are not meant to be blown away by the vocal abilities, but instead get swept up in the openness with which they sing their song.FOR MORE REVIEWS VISIT [...][...]",4,Real Movie News DVD review,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1378,"['Unfinished', 'Song', 'filled', 'predictable', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'material', 'handled', 'such', 'grace', 'dignity', 'cast', 'director', 'was', 'constantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'ability', 'move', 'Utilizing', 'music', 'melodrama', 'such', 'way', 'never', 'overwrought', 'exaggerated', 'effect', 'Unfinished', 'Song', 'mild', 'entertainment', 'up', 'profoundly', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'Even', 'supporting', 'characters', 'feel', 'very', 'natural', 'making', 'very', 'difficult', 'notice', 'when', 'anyone', 'acting', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'up', 'cast', 'Arthur', 'cranky', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'become', 'accustomed', 'habits', 'routines', 'only', 'person', 'wife', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'When', 'cancer', 'take', 'foundation', 'Arthur', 'suddenly', 'elderly', 'singing', 'group', 'Arthur', 'pulled', 'group', 'finding', 'solace', 'friendship', 'group', 'young', 'teacher', 'Elizabeth', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'Unfinished', 'Song', 'film', 'grief', 'keep', 'light', 'touch', 'material.The', 'music', 'Unfinished', 'Song', 'simple', 'effective', 'never', 'appearing', 'too', 'polished', 'unbelievable', 'more', 'heart', 'talent', 'voices', 'wonders', 'sincerity', 'film', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'vocal', 'abilities', 'instead', 'get', 'swept', 'up', 'openness', 'sing', 'song.FOR', 'MORE', 'REVIEWS', 'VISIT', '[', ']', '[', ']']",Unfinished Song

I absolutely adore this movie, written and directed with tremendous heart by Paul Andrew Williams, and have viewed it several times now.  It seems I cannot get enough of this well put together story of Arthur (Terrance Stamp) and his wife, Marion (Vanessa Redgrave).  While he goes the way of the grouch, the seeming curmudgeon most of the time, and also the one that is difficult to get along with, Marion goes the completely other direction.  She spends the small amount of time that she has left very well, she sings along with her friends in a community choir.  They are practicing for an upcoming competition, including a solo from Marion, being what she is, a physically and emotionally giving person.  You may recognize some of her fellow singers, as I saw some familiar faces in the choir.  At the end of the film, we are delighted by a couple of musical treats, although they are quite emotional to get through, they are heartwarming and so worth it.The choir instructor, Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton, 'Pirate Radio'), definitely has her challenges with Arthur, who never wishes to ever give an inch as far as the health of his wife goes.  He wants to make sure he controls everything, doesn't want to loosen that taut grip.  Hey, if you hold on hard enough, apply each and every ounce of your strength, then the something you are holding on to can never leave; Right?  Elizabeth is great with how she handles the first very gruff, Arthur.  She is a miracle in disguise for the up and coming adjustment he must make, and, also, helps with his estranged son, James (Christopher Eccleston), whom Arthur doesn't ever have much time for, but must start including in his life.This musical group is full of the elderly sect, and they choose one eclectic list of songs to sing.  This was the absolute first time that I viewed, and heard, the elderly rock out to Motorhead's, 'Ace of Spades', and then also, Salt-N-Pepa's 'Let's Talk About Sex'.  While singing may be the venue that brings around all of this activity and emotion, it is the wonderful acting of this theme which is in no way new, just different.  Everyone is there for their parts and spot-on with their character portrayals, bringing a film together that will definitely target your sensitive side and have you scooping up the Kleenex.For Marion and Arthur; the music competition, the loss of the one most loved, the solo that may go unsung, and all the emotions of what we cannot escape conclude in this metaphor, ""Unfinished Song"".",5,"""What Makes A Song Beautiful Is Not Always The Quality Of The Voice ..."" - Marion",1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,2525,"['Lovely', 'Lovely', 'Lovely', 'absolutely', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'tremendous', 'heart', 'Paul', 'Andrew', 'Williams', 'have', 'viewed', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'story', 'Arthur', 'Terrance', 'Stamp', 'wife', 'Marion', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'way', 'grouch', 'seeming', 'curmudgeon', 'most', 'time', 'also', 'one', 'difficult', 'get', 'Marion', 'completely', 'other', 'direction', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'left', 'very', 'well', 'friends', 'community', 'choir', 'are', 'practicing', 'upcoming', 'competition', 'including', 'solo', 'Marion', 'being', 'what', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'giving', 'person', 'may', 'recognize', 'fellow', 'singers', 'saw', 'familiar', 'choir', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'delighted', 'couple', 'musical', 'treats', 'are', 'quite', 'emotional', 'get', 'are', 'heartwarming', 'so', 'worth', 'it.The', 'choir', 'instructor', 'Elizabeth', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', ""'Pirate"", 'Radio', 'definitely', 'challenges', 'Arthur', 'who', 'never', 'ever', 'give', 'inch', 'as', 'far', 'health', 'wife', 'make', 'sure', 'everything', ""n't"", 'want', 'loosen', 'taut', 'grip', 'Hey', 'hold', 'hard', 'enough', 'apply', 'ounce', 'strength', 'then', 'something', 'are', 'holding', 'can', 'never', 'leave', 'Right', 'Elizabeth', 'great', 'how', 'first', 'very', 'gruff', 'Arthur', 'miracle', 'disguise', 'up', 'coming', 'adjustment', 'must', 'make', 'also', 'estranged', 'son', 'James', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'whom', 'Arthur', ""n't"", 'ever', 'have', 'much', 'time', 'must', 'start', 'including', 'life.This', 'musical', 'group', 'full', 'elderly', 'sect', 'choose', 'one', 'eclectic', 'list', 'songs', 'sing', 'was', 'absolute', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'heard', 'elderly', 'rock', 'Motorhead', ""'Ace"", 'Spades', 'then', 'also', 'Salt-N-Pepa', ""'Let"", 'Talk', 'Sex', 'singing', 'may', 'be', 'venue', 'activity', 'emotion', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'theme', 'way', 'new', 'just', 'different', 'Everyone', 'there', 'parts', 'spot-on', 'character', 'portrayals', 'bringing', 'film', 'together', 'will', 'definitely', 'target', 'sensitive', 'side', 'have', 'scooping', 'up', 'Kleenex.For', 'Marion', 'Arthur', 'music', 'competition', 'loss', 'one', 'most', 'loved', 'solo', 'may', 'go', 'unsung', 'emotions', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'conclude', 'metaphor', 'Unfinished', 'Song']",Unfinished Song
