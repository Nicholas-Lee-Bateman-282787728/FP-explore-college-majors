Most of these low-budget films fell on deaf ears to begin with, but I think 'Big' and 1989's 'The Burbs' got him ready for his award winning 90s'. 'The Burbs' takes place on a dead end street in a suburb, a scene clasicly stereotyped where everybody knows everybody else, you could set your watch by daily events and lawnmowers are no bigger than a red wagon. When strange foreign neighbors move nextdoor though, thoughts and suspisions arise rapidly among suburbanites who have nothing better to do. Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks), is enjoying a relaxing week off at home with his overwieght, annoying neighbor Art...and a mis-cast Bruce Dern who poorly portrays a rough-edged ex-soldier (But still cracks me up). The three become obsessed with odd noises and smells from the grotesque house, believing that the new neighbors are murderers. Hanks makes the script work perfectly with his mild insanity and inability to handle stress, I think a blind person could watch the movie and know it was Hanks just by hearing him rant and rave. Unlike Hanks' movies in the years before 'The Burbs', director Joe Dante adds a great story and more than suitable music to connect with Hanks' talent and make this movie explode. With Halloween coming up this movie makes a great buy at a great price, some inappropriate language...but thats all.

He, and the rest of his friends in the cul- de sac they live in, are suspicious of their weird new neighbors. They hear and see weird things going on there. Since he's off work, and has a lot of time on his hands, Hanks gets roped into finding out the mystery of these interesting new additions to the street. Comedian Rick Duccommun plays Hanks' best friend Art. Bruce Dern is their marine-like neighbor across the street. Carrie Fisher plays Hanks' wife. The weirdo family is headed by Henry Gibson. The movie has a number of goofy and funny scenes. One wishes the movie was even darker and went a bit further with some of the stuff, but oh well. The climax is a big, all out there surprise.

Imaginations run wild over what's going on in the  new neighbors creepy old home. Rick Ducommun gives a supreme performance as  the one neighbor (Art Weingartner) who so easily jumps to conlusions it's  scary. Scary in that he is like so many people in America whose  imaginations cause them to often jump to the wildest conclusions which, in  turn, often lead to hysteria.  Haven't you ever known someone whose awkward  appearances or practices or even perhaps their circumstances cause them to  be made the center of the town's wild imaginations? and it's these kind of  folks who are often the target for &quot;witch hunts&quot;.

All Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) wants to do is enjoy his weekend off, but when the new creepy neighbors show up they become the subject of the neighborhood. While Ray tries to escape the mystery surrounding the Klopeks, his friends on the block continue to pester him about the new people. And, when one of the neighbors disappears, even Ray begins to have suspicions.  Welcome to Suburbia!The Burbs, probably a movie you would not notice in a video store, is a great summer comedy because of its originality and darkness. With Tom Hanks, Carrie Fisher (as his wife), Bruce Dern, and Corey Feldman, this movie asks the question: How well do you really know your neighbors? (Which begs the second question: How much do you really want to know?)Ray and his neighbor chums begin to look around and discover, little by little, what could be the breakthrough to their answers. The only question is how far will they dig and how far will they go before they find the answer (...or how far before they get caught). The zaniness and slapstick type of humor is great in this movie, and the movie certainly asserts a message about privacy (of lack thereof) when dealing with neighbors.Best lines:Ray Peterson: "" I've never seen that. Ive never seen anyone drive their garbage to the street and bang the hell out of it with a stick.&quot;Uncle Reuben Klopek: ""NO!""Mark Rumsfield: ""About a nine on the tension scale, Rube.""I recommend this movie for anyone.

Most were crap, and the average moviegoer can be forgiven for mistaking this film for one of those.  But it really doesn't fit the mold.  I don't know if the filmgoers were purposefully spoofing such films or not, but the plot was described as ""a man goes on vacation in his own neighborhood.""To be totally honest, I never thought the ""vacation"" angle came across as strongly as may have been intended.  It's more of a ""weekend"" movie than a ""vacation"" movie, to me.Anyway, the basic story is that a man and his oddball neighbors in a middle-class, middle-American cul-de-sac spend the weekend trying to get to the bottom of what their new reclusive neighbors are up to.  Why do they never show their faces?  Why do they keep their house in such bad condition?  Why are they out digging in their yard at night?  Why do they drive their trash to the garbage can and then beat the heck out of it with a rake at midnight in the rain?  And so on.  Are they....gasp....a cult of murderous satanists?Rick Ducommun, Bruce Dern, and Tom Hanks give epitaph-worthy performances.  I don't think I've ever seen Hanks do physical comedy in anything else, but his stumbling-down-the-stairs bit near the end is worthy of Keaton (I'm not really spoiling anything).This is a perfectly-paced, impeccably-timed comedy masterpiece.  It blends farce, slapstick, adventure, horror, suspense, and contains the kind of breezy, highly-entertaining, just-plain-fun film-making that is perfect for gatherings of family and friends.

I feel as if there are a lot of scenes cut out and the movie was cut down to size in the editing room.Tom Hanks and his pals get carried away with the idea that their neighbors (The Klopeks) are psychos and they take their suspicions to morbid extremes by spying, nosing around and harassing them. I enjoyed this movie as a kid but it's a bit annoying now.We never REALLY find out what exactly it is the Klopeks do or who they are. All we know is that they don't mow their front lawn and that's it. Bruce Dern has a lively role as an old Army Vet, Rick Ducommun is Hanks' scrounger pal, Corey Feldman is a stereotyped 'Bill and Ted' stoned teen and Dick Miller makes his obligatory appearance in a Joe Dante movie.The strongest feature of the movie is Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful score which is full of atmosphere and brilliant themes. Why can't more comedy movies have scores as lively as this?Dante's signature is all over this movie. It's just a shame they decided to cut it down due to running time (if that is the case). I know of the alternate ending in which Hanks is killed. I think that would have saved the movie. Anyway, it's well worth checking out.The DVD is in dire need of a remaster. Some of the interior scenes look positively shocking. Universal really ought to clean this film up for a Blu Ray release.The DVD is in Dolby Surround and is anamorphically enhanced at  1.85:1.One last thing...on my DVD I have a picture of a bunch of flowers  located somewhere on the disc as a hidden feature.

You get  the trailer and the main bonus: the Alternative Ending.Now the  Alternative Ending SUCKS compared to the Real Ending, but seeing the  alternative ending makes you see how much better the real one was.  DVD  producers should always throw of this kind of stuff onto their DVDs.  Even  if they are not sure if it adds to the movie.  Since they are on the  inside, they view things like editing and reshooting as boring - to those  of us on the outside it makes the movie more interesting and it makes us  appreciate the finished product more.Hollywood hides the movie making  process from us because they think that it takes away some of the  &quot;magic&quot; of the movie.  However, seeing the behind-the-scenes  stuff actually makes us enjoy the movie more.Okay, off of that  soapbox...This is a good movie, but it did not get 5 stars because it is  not as good as Apollo 13 or Glory - we really need a 10-star system here.

In Ray Peterson's neighborhood that guy was a local soda jerk who murdered his own family one unusually hot summer, many years ago. Well, it's an unusually hot summer again, a new and reclusive family has moved into the neighborhood, and Ray and his friends' imaginations are running wild.Tom Hanks plays Ray Peterson, who is extremely curious about the secretive new people next door, the Klopeks. His imagination is fueled not just by their strange habits, which include driving their garbage out from their garage to their curb and digging huge holes in their backyard, but also by the crazy ideas of his fellow neighbors, trouble instigator Art (Rick Ducommun), arms dealer Rumsfield (Bruce Dern), and teenager Ricky (Corey Feldman). They are convinced that the Klopeks murdered the family that lived in their house before them, and that they've hidden the bodies somewhere on the property. When another neighbor turns up missing, Ray and his friends naturally assume the elderly man has been added to the Klopeks' body-count. Their suspicions quickly come to a boil, and the group decides to plan a thorough hunt for the bodies as soon as possible. When Ray's cute but nagging wife, played by Carrie Fisher, takes their son away for the weekend, the boys decide it's time to strike! Armed with walkie talkies, shovels, and other gear, the 3 adults take over the temporarily abandoned house and yard, while Ricky gathers his teenage friends in his own yard to watch ""the show.""Dark comedies may not be all that popular with the majority of the public, but The 'Burbs is definitely one of the funniest movies out there! Tom Hanks was always wonderful in comedy, lest we forget, and the supporting cast is equally hilarious! Bruce Dern's military nut character is unforgettable, Rick Ducommon's Art brings back so many memories of kids we used to know, Corey Feldman's Ricky gets laugh after laugh with his great lines, Wendy Schaal is cute as a button as Bruce's wife Bonnie, and the spaghetti western ending really is the icing on the cake! But what really hits the mark with this movie is how well we can see ourselves reflected in it. Those of us who live in the suburbs anyway. Now, before I go, here are just a few of my favorite lines from the film to listen for as you watch it: ""It came with the frame,"" ""Hey, Pinocchio!"", and ""My wife is home?!!""",5,Ever wonder what your neighbors are really up to?,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,2549,"['suburban', 'neighborhood', 'story', 'average', 'guy', 'block', 'who', 'mowed', 'lawn', '800th', 'time', 'finally', 'snapped', 'committing', 'horrible', 'crime', 'made', 'local', 'legend', 'Ray', 'Peterson', 'neighborhood', 'guy', 'was', 'local', 'soda', 'jerk', 'who', 'murdered', 'own', 'family', 'one', 'unusually', 'hot', 'summer', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Well', 'unusually', 'hot', 'summer', 'again', 'new', 'reclusive', 'family', 'moved', 'neighborhood', 'Ray', 'friends', 'imaginations', 'are', 'running', 'wild.Tom', 'Hanks', 'Ray', 'Peterson', 'who', 'extremely', 'curious', 'secretive', 'new', 'people', 'door', 'Klopeks', 'imagination', 'fueled', 'not', 'just', 'strange', 'habits', 'include', 'driving', 'garbage', 'garage', 'curb', 'digging', 'huge', 'holes', 'backyard', 'also', 'crazy', 'ideas', 'fellow', 'neighbors', 'trouble', 'instigator', 'Art', 'Rick', 'Ducommun', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Rumsfield', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'teenager', 'Ricky', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'are', 'convinced', 'Klopeks', 'murdered', 'family', 'lived', 'house', ""'ve"", 'hidden', 'bodies', 'somewhere', 'property', 'When', 'neighbor', 'up', 'missing', 'Ray', 'friends', 'naturally', 'assume', 'elderly', 'man', 'been', 'added', 'Klopeks', 'body-count', 'suspicions', 'quickly', 'come', 'boil', 'group', 'plan', 'thorough', 'hunt', 'bodies', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'When', 'Ray', 'cute', 'nagging', 'wife', 'played', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'son', 'away', 'weekend', 'boys', 'decide', 'time', 'strike', 'Armed', 'walkie', 'talkies', 'shovels', 'other', 'gear', '3', 'adults', 'take', 'temporarily', 'abandoned', 'house', 'yard', 'Ricky', 'gathers', 'teenage', 'friends', 'own', 'yard', 'watch', 'show', 'Dark', 'comedies', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'popular', 'majority', 'public', ""'Burbs"", 'definitely', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'always', 'wonderful', 'comedy', 'forget', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'hilarious', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'military', 'nut', 'character', 'unforgettable', 'Rick', 'Ducommon', 'Art', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'kids', 'used', 'know', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Ricky', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'great', 'lines', 'Wendy', 'Schaal', 'cute', 'button', 'Bruce', 'wife', 'Bonnie', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'ending', 'really', 'icing', 'cake', 'what', 'really', 'mark', 'movie', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'reflected', 'who', 'live', 'suburbs', 'anyway', 'Now', 'go', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'favorite', 'lines', 'film', 'listen', 'watch', 'came', 'frame', 'Hey', 'Pinocchio', 'wife', 'home']",N/A
64905,A228JH8V9Y700G,0783233515,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","This movie was made at a rather odd time in Tom Hanks's career.  He had made his mark in movies successfully as a comic actor, was at the moment when he was considering more dramatic roles, and was making some comic movies that were not as successful as one would've liked.  (Hence the three pack of The Money Pit and Dragnet and this movie also available.)  This movie, while not received as well by critics or audiences alike, is remembered because it stars Tom Hanks.  It is, however, a rather quirky and hilarious ride through a real horror story, which is life in the suburbs.  Thanks to Joe Dante's rather bizarre sense of humor, this movie came to fruition and it's a real scream, especially to those who love social commentary and the strangeness of life in the suburbs.Tom Hanks plays Ray, an everyman who has taken a week off work to spend a lazy week at home relaxing, drinking beer and watching TV.  There is, however, something strange going on next door.  In the ratty, unkept house next door, there are some new neighbors who moved in and no one seems to know much about them.  When they hear strange goings on at night, people naturally start to wonder.  Ray and his bumbling neighbors, Art, Mark and Ricky (played with all the finesse of Corey Feldman at his teen idol peek) start creeping around.  When they decide to finally invite themselves over and have a friendly chat, they find their new neighbors, The Klopeks, are a rather odd lot and not as friendly as they would like them to be.  They end up spying on them, seeing some rather odd things, while their long suffering wives (Carrie Fischer and Wendy Schaal) are going along for the ride.  THen their neighbor, an elderly man named Walter, vanishes.  Convinced that their neighbors have done away with him, Ray, Art and Mark stage an elaborate plan to dig him up and prove that their neighbors are gravediggers.  The house ends up exploding.The screwball comedy antics are a lot of fun, especially between three bumbling friends who are bent on trying to solve a mystery.  But this is a commentary on how people are.  Instead of directly asking others, we hide behind guises of forced politeness.  The neighbors in question, actually, are not the weirdos, we are.  Instead of directly doing or saying things, we spy and then talk among ourselves in typical gossip fashion.  Why?  What are we afraid of?  Apparently a lot of things.  And Corey Feldman (check out that Michael Jackson jacket he's wearing and how his friends and girlfriend are dressed in those hideous 80s fashions!) as Ricky does perhaps the best thing possible, by observing it as if it was some kind of spectator's sport, better than movies or television could ever do for you.  Because, as we would find out, nothing is as entertaining as real life.

Ray takes a week off from work, & plans to just peacfully hangout @ home while using his vacation time. Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia in Star Wars) plays as his wife. They have a son & a dog. Ray's wife tries to get Ray. To go with her,their son & dog to a cabin. Ray would rather just lounge around the house. One of Ray's suburb neighbors begins to gossip about some new neighbors that have just moved in next door to Ray. He begins to talk with Ray about the odd/eerie things about these mysterious new neighbors. Ray soon get's sucked into the possibilities of his friend's thoughts & stories, and also becomes nosey. Another neighbor suddenly seems to have dissapeared. And Ray along with his fellow neighbors plan to get to the bottom of things. Ray's wife continues to get on Ray about his sudden obsession with the new creepy neighbors. The plot thickens as other strange occurrances happen. Only enveloping the neighbors attention even more! This is a real classic suspence-comedy!!! It has many funny lines and scenes in it. The characters are great! These characters are probably going to remind you of people that live in your neighborhood. Which only makes this flick even that much funnier!!! I know I don't live in nearly as nice of a neighborhood, but these characters are similar to some around me. This movie has great replay value. It is widescreen format. The picture and sound quality is what you can expect from a 80's movie that has been put onto DVD. Which isn't a bad thing, it's still enjoyable for sure!

Ray and Art dig in the Klopek's backyard and find nothing and then break into their house find some bodies. There in the basement, they hit something. You'll have to see the ending to believe it. It's dynamite! Everybody delivers an under-rated performance and Art eats way too much food. Ray yells way too much. Dog poo galore! This movie has everything and it's definitely Tom Hanks' best comedy ever. Joe Dante does a great job of directing this eerie, dark comedy.",5,Love Thy Neighbor,1023494400,"06 8, 2002",2002,1893,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'Ray', 'Petersen', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'relax', 'have', 'peaceful', 'vacation', 'one', 'thing', 'stopping', 'lounging', 'out', 'fold-out', 'chair', 'drinking', 'beer', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Klopeks', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'night', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'digging', 'backyard', 'Petersen', 'neighbors', 'are', 'curious', 'mystery', 'people', 'think', ""'re"", 'part', 'dark', 'conspiracy', 'Art', 'Rick', 'Ducommun', 'Rumsfield', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Ricky', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'talk', 'ghoulish', 'happenings', 'start', 'investigate', 'Klopeks', 'What', 'ghastly', 'fun', 'movie', 'Petersen', 'be', 'conservative', 'friends', 'just', 'want', 'play', 'spy', 'Klopeks', 'drive', 'garage', 'beats', 'garbage', 'bag', 'can', 'stick', 'Sadistic', 'Then', 'old', 'man', 'snoop', 'place', 'plate', 'cookies', 'waste', 'then', 'neighborhood', 'introduce', 'Klopeks', 'what', 'shocker', 'Rumsfeld', 'complimentary', 'browies', ""'forget"", 'GD', 'brownies', 'was', 'lordage', 'Hans', 'geeky', 'red-headed', 'boy', 'door', 'tries', 'swat', 'flies', 'buzzing', 'head', 'Comical', 'Then', 'old', 'Klopek', 'who', 'deepest', 'voice', 'world', 'was', 'sheer', 'delight', 'Then', 'Klopek', 'who', 'be', 'doctor', 'blood', 'hands', 'Vile', 'end', 'Klopeks', 'leave', 'house', 'day', 'field', 'trip', 'then', 'Rumsfeld', 'brought', 'out', 'military', 'gear', 'Ray', 'Art', 'dig', 'Klopek', 'backyard', 'find', 'nothing', 'then', 'break', 'house', 'find', 'bodies', 'basement', 'hit', 'something', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'ending', 'believe', 'dynamite', 'Everybody', 'under-rated', 'performance', 'Art', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'food', 'Ray', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Dog', 'poo', 'galore', 'movie', 'everything', 'definitely', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'best', 'comedy', 'ever', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'great', 'job', 'directing', 'eerie', 'dark', 'comedy']",N/A
64930,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,0783233515,T O'Brien,"[0, 0]","The 'Burbs is a great comedy from the late 80's that hits all the right notes, blending both the comedy and thriller/mystery genres.  Ray Peterson is your typical suburban father living with his wife, Carol, son, Dave, and dog Vince on a beautiful suburban cul-de-sac.  But his new next door neighbors, the Klopeks, are an odd bunch, never leaving the house, but Ray hears all sorts of strange noises coming from their basement and even sees them digging in their backyard in the middle of the night.  Along with his neighbors Art and Rumsfield, Ray grows suspicious of the Klopeks and begins to investigate what's really going on next door.  With the whole movie taking place in this suburban cul-de-sac, The 'Burbs has both funny and scary moments, and blends the two genres seamlessly.  Toward the end of the movie, the laughs are amped up even more as the truth reveals itself.  Don't miss this movie, it's a great comedy.Starring as Ray Peterson, Tom Hanks is the perfect ""everyman,"" the suburban dad who simply wants to enjoy his week of vacation at home peacefully.  For many scenes, Hanks gets to play straightman to the rest of the cast, but he has some great lines.  Bruce Dern steals the movie as Mark Rumsfield, Ray's neighbor across the street, a Vietnam vet who still seems to be in the bush.  Carrie Fisher is good as Carol, Ray's wife who just wants her husband to relax.  Rick Ducommun is also very funny as Art, the paranoid neighbor convinced the Klopeks are up to no good.  The teaming of Hanks, Dern, and Ducommun is great, the trio has the movie's best moments.  Corey Feldman plays stoner teenager Ricky Butler, a kid who just loves watching the goings-on on his block.  The creepy Klopeks are played by Henry Gibson, Brother Theodore, and Courtney Gains.  Wendy Schaal rounds out the cast as Bonnie, Rumsfield's wife who sides with Carol.The DVD is a good buy considering how cheap it is.  It offers the movie in widescreen presentation, a good alternate ending that runs about 7-minutes, a trailer with several cuts and alternate scenes that didn't make the final print of the movie, production notes, and some cast and crew biographies/filmographies.  Be careful though, you never know when a Special Edition DVD might be released.  For now, this DVD version is a safe buy for fans of the movie.
