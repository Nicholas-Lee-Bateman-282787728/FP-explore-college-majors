666410,AIMR915K4YCN,B00005MM6U,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[1, 1]","Tobey Maguire (THE ICE STORM) stars as JT, a bored, disaffected teen working at a dumpy motel in a small, hick town. JT meets a tenant named Tanya (Amy Hathaway) who happens to be a prostitute, whose dad (Adam West!) is her pimp. Together, along w/ JT's friend, they steal a car and embark on a wild night of violence and mayhem. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the stolen car belongs to a female assassin who happens to be staying at the motel, and that her latest victim is in the trunk! JOYRIDE is an off-center thriller w/ an unusual storyline. I don't believe anything in the entire movie went in the direction I thought it would! I like that in a movie!

This is just bad directing, poor editing, and a rough script, poor make up effects and probably everything other than casting was sub standard is my guess.  The shame of it is that there was plenty of acting talent there for someone to work with, just no talent to make it work!

666413,A3QEDCYNR6H11M,B00005MM6U,Gary,"[1, 1]","At first Joyride looked to be a small budget version of Natural Born Killers. Then Badlands, maybe. In the end, this movie made its own niche.The entire cast was talented and delivered powerful performances. Even minor characters were 3-dimensional and then some (my favorite among these being the uniformed cop). In those instances where little action accompanied dialogue, the actors still made things interesting with comments, expressions, voice tones, etc.,. The screenwriter - Quinton Peeples - has both a sense of drama and humor.Joyride managed to entertain with no help from exotic locales. Most scenes took place in relatively dreary settings like a run down motel parking lot, thus always needing something other than majestic mountains or 5-star restaurants to hold viewers' interest. Peeples as Director accomplished this in several ways, including giving several supporting characters enough face time to flesh out their roles and thereby add variety to his cinematic offering. What impressed me most, however, were the story's twists. I lost track of its surprising turns, often dramatic (and a couple stretching credulity, to be frank). Another technique was mystery: What exactly was happening in Tanya's room? Anticipation? You bet. Whenever Smith was in a scene... Let's just say she's a woman you do not want to upset.

666419,A1H1BUM6QZ4ROZ,B00005MM6U,Trevor William Douglas,"[7, 9]","Produced in 1996, this film is enjoyable on many levels. Drama, comedy, thriller...Tobey Maguire shows his star power. He seems to be having fun with the role of J.T. Likewise his co-stars Wilson Cruz and Amy Hathaway work well together as three friends trying to escape their various situations in life. Adam West and Steven Gilborn are cast against type to advantage and a nice cameo from James Karen also add to the enjoyment. Benicio Del Toro is hilarious as the deadly serious Detective Lopez and Kenn Norman is believable as the sheriff. Also noteworthy is Judson Mills as Redneck Joey. Lastly I have to say Christina Naify is a standout as 'Smith'. At once sexy and deadly, she plays her part exceptionally well. Thoroughly recommended. The DVD has no special features of note, with the exception of a filmography and biography of Tobey Maguire. The print is excellent and the sound crisp.
