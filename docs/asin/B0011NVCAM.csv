Created by Darren Starr and produced by the late Aaron Spelling, this show is 100% melodrama done right. I was a fan from day one, Melrose Place had a vibrant and ever-changing cast, outrageous storylines, and never took itself too seriously. They don't make shows this campy anymore! I just adore this season so I highly recommend purchasing season four.

1132022,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B0011NVCAM,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[0, 0]","Season 4 of 'Melrose Place' brings forth all the drama, soap plots, twists and turns one would expect from the show. You have secret pasts being revealed, interesting hook-ups, near death experiences, murder and more. Off hand, I didn't think the season was horrible by any means but it was less gripping (at least at the start) than the previous seasons. By the end of the season though, the season and plots seem to hit a stride that kept me wanting more. Early on though? The season felt as if dragged on with not a lot happening.The Bad: To keep the show interesting and unpredictable, we're treated to a new glimpse at some of our favorite characters. Early on in the season, Jane and Alison make a pact to stop being push-overs and be more proactive in their lives. Yet, Jane somewhat slips into annoying territory as she becomes more of a diva and the resident b*tch, always dismissing her friends and trying to be a tough business woman rather than the balanced character we knew from the start. In this season, we also see Billy go through a transformation that made him feel rather detached and strained, seeming a bit more elusive and uninterested than Andrew Shue's usual portrayal and acting. Poor Jo Reynolds. Not much happens with her character. While we're treated to seeing her actual work and do a lot of photography within Jane and her new beau's fashion firm, Jo seems like the character that's there but not really there. She's attached to others' plots, others' lives, never really standing out on her own this season. Amanda is revealed as having had a secret life before her arrival at Melrose Place. It's very stereotypical soap opera and is dragged out through the entire season. To be honest, it started out as sort of interesting but by the end of the season the plot, and the characters it introduced to the show, are dull and uninteresting. Being that Amanda's plot was the main mystery, plot and hub of the season, this really was distracting and took away from the show a bit with how it was handled.The Good: The first half of the season seemed unsteady and unsure of itself and its characters. The second half though was much stronger and together and had me hooked and screaming at the television in excitement and suspense. We had the return of 'crazy' Kimberly whose quest for revenge lands one character in a sanatorium, taking a cue from 'Dallas' where J.R. continually threatens, and sometimes placed, Sue Ellen to 'punish' her. This plot was by far the best and involved a lot of the characters in the show, and even provided Priscilla Beaulieu Presley (who, I might add, starred in 'Dallas') a small, multi-episode role as a nurse working in a mental asylum having to deal with a deranged Kimberly Shaw (who, by the way, acted much like Marcia Cross' Bree Van de Kemp character from 'Desperate Housewives'). Sydney and Jane also go head-to-head this season and end the season in a very interesting murder plot involving another lead 'Melrose Place' character. I enjoyed Alison's overall arc this season which saw her going from continually playing the victim role and being hooked on Billy to finally stepping out on her own, being more assertive and actually being the one to help others rather than being the hot mess of a character that continually needed saving.In conclusion, the season felt a bit long and some of the plots could have been handled better. The cast of characters felt as if it got a bit too big to be handled accordingly (look at how it's hard to fit all of them on the cover). Many of the characters including Jake, Jo and Matt hardly seem to get any real attention or good plots of their own. It's much of the same for them, and it felt a bit tired. Still, 'Melrose Place' kept with its shocking plots, twisty story lines, surprising hook-ups and elusive relationships which made it worth watching and addictive. Nothing like this remains on modern television, which is a shame. Definitely worth buying if you're looking for good entertainment.",4,Revew of 'Melrose Place' Season 4 [MINOR SPOILERS],1250899200,"08 22, 2009",2009,4010,"['Season', '4', ""'Melrose"", 'Place', 'brings', 'forth', 'drama', 'soap', 'plots', 'twists', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'show', 'have', 'secret', 'pasts', 'being', 'revealed', 'interesting', 'hook-ups', 'death', 'experiences', 'murder', 'more', 'Off', 'hand', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', 'was', 'horrible', 'means', 'was', 'less', 'gripping', 'least', 'start', 'previous', 'seasons', 'end', 'season', 'season', 'plots', 'seem', 'hit', 'stride', 'kept', 'wanting', 'more', 'Early', 'season', 'felt', 'dragged', 'not', 'lot', 'happening.The', 'Bad', 'keep', 'show', 'interesting', 'unpredictable', ""'re"", 'treated', 'new', 'glimpse', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Early', 'season', 'Jane', 'Alison', 'make', 'pact', 'stop', 'being', 'push-overs', 'be', 'more', 'proactive', 'lives', 'Jane', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'territory', 'more', 'diva', 'resident', 'b*tch', 'always', 'dismissing', 'friends', 'trying', 'be', 'tough', 'business', 'woman', 'rather', 'balanced', 'character', 'knew', 'start', 'season', 'also', 'see', 'Billy', 'go', 'transformation', 'made', 'feel', 'rather', 'detached', 'strained', 'seeming', 'bit', 'more', 'elusive', 'uninterested', 'Andrew', 'Shue', 'usual', 'portrayal', 'acting', 'Poor', 'Jo', 'Reynolds', 'Not', 'much', 'happens', 'character', ""'re"", 'treated', 'seeing', 'actual', 'work', 'do', 'lot', 'photography', 'Jane', 'new', 'beau', 'fashion', 'firm', 'Jo', 'character', 'there', 'not', 'really', 'there', 'attached', 'others', 'plots', 'others', 'lives', 'never', 'really', 'standing', 'out', 'own', 'season', 'Amanda', 'revealed', 'having', 'had', 'secret', 'life', 'arrival', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'soap', 'opera', 'dragged', 'out', 'entire', 'season', 'be', 'honest', 'started', 'out', 'sort', 'interesting', 'end', 'season', 'plot', 'characters', 'introduced', 'show', 'are', 'dull', 'uninteresting', 'Being', 'Amanda', 'plot', 'was', 'main', 'mystery', 'plot', 'hub', 'season', 'really', 'was', 'distracting', 'took', 'away', 'show', 'bit', 'how', 'was', 'handled.The', 'Good', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'seemed', 'unsteady', 'unsure', 'characters', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'much', 'stronger', 'together', 'had', 'hooked', 'screaming', 'television', 'excitement', 'suspense', 'had', 'return', ""'crazy"", 'Kimberly', 'quest', 'revenge', 'one', 'character', 'sanatorium', 'taking', 'cue', ""'Dallas"", 'where', 'J.R.', 'continually', 'sometimes', 'placed', 'Sue', 'Ellen', ""'punish"", 'plot', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'involved', 'lot', 'characters', 'show', 'even', 'provided', 'Priscilla', 'Beaulieu', 'Presley', 'who', 'might', 'add', 'starred', ""'Dallas"", 'small', 'multi-episode', 'role', 'nurse', 'working', 'mental', 'asylum', 'having', 'deal', 'deranged', 'Kimberly', 'Shaw', 'who', 'way', 'acted', 'much', 'Marcia', 'Cross', 'Bree', 'Van', 'Kemp', 'character', ""'Desperate"", 'Housewives', 'Sydney', 'Jane', 'also', 'go', 'head-to-head', 'season', 'end', 'season', 'very', 'interesting', 'murder', 'plot', 'involving', 'lead', 'Place', 'character', 'enjoyed', 'Alison', 'overall', 'arc', 'season', 'saw', 'going', 'continually', 'playing', 'victim', 'role', 'being', 'hooked', 'Billy', 'finally', 'stepping', 'out', 'own', 'being', 'more', 'assertive', 'actually', 'being', 'one', 'help', 'others', 'rather', 'being', 'hot', 'mess', 'character', 'continually', 'needed', 'saving.In', 'conclusion', 'season', 'felt', 'bit', 'long', 'plots', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'cast', 'characters', 'felt', 'got', 'bit', 'too', 'big', 'be', 'handled', 'accordingly', 'look', 'how', 'hard', 'fit', 'cover', 'Many', 'characters', 'including', 'Jake', 'Jo', 'Matt', 'hardly', 'seem', 'get', 'real', 'attention', 'good', 'plots', 'own', 'much', 'same', 'felt', 'bit', 'tired', 'Still', ""'Melrose"", 'Place', 'kept', 'shocking', 'plots', 'twisty', 'story', 'lines', 'surprising', 'hook-ups', 'elusive', 'relationships', 'made', 'worth', 'watching', 'addictive', 'Nothing', 'modern', 'television', 'shame', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'buying', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'entertainment']",Melrose Place: Season 4
1132023,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B0011NVCAM,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[5, 7]","Just when I thought the quality of a DVD set couldn't get worse than Melrose Season 3...readers: I present to you Melrose Place Season 4! Season 3 had a few short and crappy extra ""featurettes"", whereas this set has zilch, zero, zippo. Not even the worthless season recaps. And the quality of the video itself is marginal; definitely watchable, but as before looks like it came from an old video master and not film, with a fair amount of artifacts. So, as for the quality of the packaging & dvds, give this set a hearty 2. On the plus side, just the fact that this set made it to DVD is great. What a guilty treat to watch the return of some of TV's favorite characters. As before, Heather Locklear carries the show as ad exec/apartment building owner Amanda Woodward. She is ably supported by Laura Leighton's character Sydney (definitely one of my faves!) and Marcia Cross as the crazy Dr. Kimberly Shaw. There are the usually bad performances by Kristin Davis (Charlotte ""Sex In The City""), Patrick Muldoon (formerly ""Days of Our Lives""), and worst of all Daphne Zuniga. Still, the show holds up extremely well with its over-the-top-but-can't-stop-watching-plots. Plenty of guest ""stars"" in Season 4: Priscilla Presley as a ""frumpy"" nurse, Patrick Muldoon is back as Jane's very aggressive boyfriend, Julie Newmar (PLEASE stop the facelifts! Wow!), Loni Anderson, Denise Richards, and Antonio Sabato Jr. as Amanda's ex. Enjoy this set folks, because after this one, the show just couldn't live up to its reputation and it began to go downhill. Plenty of quick and fun plot twists in this one, which begins with the explosion of Melrose Place that we saw in Season Three at the hands of crazy Kimberly. Hard to keep up with the bed-hopping though; Amanda in particular goes back and forth so fast on who she's in love with that it'll give you whiplash. A solid 5 stars for campy entertainment, with an overall rating of 3 stars for the quality & episodes.

Too many guest stars and flash-in-the-pan characters (particularly from Amanda's past) are introduced and some meet sudden ends that feels like a total cheat.  Letting Kimberly move into the building that she just blew up as well as host a radio show?  Just a bit of a stretch, even by Melrose standards.  Some characters like Brooke never end up having any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  There are a few highlights, though, and they include Jane's transformation from victim to vixen, and the refocus on a key D&D; storyline with Amanda/Alison/Billy midway through the year.No special features on this set, which also happens to be the last Melrose Place release that is a full season before they began to split them up into two-part installments.",2,Going off the rails,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,884,"['fourth', 'season', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'where', 'felt', 'went', 'rails', 'never', 'recovered', 'Too', 'many', 'guest', 'stars', 'flash-in-the-pan', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Amanda', 'past', 'are', 'introduced', 'meet', 'sudden', 'feels', 'total', 'cheat', 'Letting', 'Kimberly', 'move', 'building', 'just', 'blew', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'host', 'radio', 'show', 'Just', 'bit', 'stretch', 'even', 'Melrose', 'standards', 'characters', 'Brooke', 'never', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'whatsoever', 'are', 'few', 'highlights', 'include', 'Jane', 'transformation', 'victim', 'vixen', 'refocus', 'key', 'D', 'D', 'storyline', 'Amanda/Alison/Billy', 'midway', 'year.No', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'also', 'be', 'last', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'release', 'full', 'season', 'began', 'split', 'up', 'two-part', 'installments']",Melrose Place: Season 4
1132026,A2NKXXWUY2R41E,B0011NVCAM,"Fjireland ""fjireland""","[6, 6]","Hey everyone!So, thankfully the wait is over and our Melrose Place Season 4 sets have arrived.I can't wait to see all of the 34 episodes in this set now that I have started- season 4 was the season I discovered MP on t.v. and it remained my fave one after I caught up on seasons 1-3 and after seeing the rest of the series (seasons 5-7). It's the best season for me because they really pushed the characters to new extremes this time and it is the best season for some of the characters (Jane, Kimberly) before the mass exodus that occurred during and towards the end of the last truly great season (season five).I agree with what other people have been saying about this release- it is poor indeed this time in many ways (namely poor packaging and no extras) but it doesn't surprise me.I know everything about this release is cheap and basic but at the end of the day, packaging means little to us. The dvds themselves contain the real content we are buying... and all 34 season 4 episodes are present and i don't have any complaints about the quality of the episodes themselves, sure they are not in mega-pixled blu-ray quality but such technologies weren't around at the time of filming. There is nothing wrong with the quality of the episodes... they are here in the condition they aired on t.v. originally.Yes, the cover pictures are blurry on the packaging and this is sloppy, careless and avoidable, but it's no big prob, the dvds are just plain grey this time- again not the end of the world and actually i think they look better than the other sets, the episode summaries are gone too- no big issue either for me anyway. I know people don't like the new way of storing the dvds themselves too- i too prefer separate boxes but i suppose it's cheaper for CBS DVD and better for the environment too and i know other people have said their holders were broken inside when they got them but mine arrived fully intact all the way to ireland from the us via new zealand so they should be okay if you get em in one piece! As for extras, well there are none this time. But I don't really mind this either, the ones on previous sets were just lame attempts to make you think you were getting something extra, really they were scenes from the season edited into little clip shows  with fancy little titles to make it look like something interesting. So no extras this time and I don't care. I don't doubt they could have made some/ found old footage etc. but why would they bother? I figure we should just be grateful we are getting any further releases at all.I really hope they don't abandon the series- at least not until the last good season (five) is released. But they could easily do so, they aren't releasing anymore already for my region since they stopped after season two (I'm in region 2 for dvds which is a substantial market: taking in Europe, Japan and South Africa and I have been surprised and annoyed that no more Melrose is being made available here) and other late-night soaps (like Knot's Landing) haven't sold well and have been abandoned entirely too.I mean the last three seasons hardly were bestsellers and I guess CBS DVD like every other big commercial company is just thinking of the bottom line- profit. So, all things considered, I just feel lucky that I am able to get my hands on more episodes/ seasons of the show.As for the show itself, well I like anyone else buying this (I figure) knows already what we are getting- 34 gripping episodes of one of the best 90's t.v. shows. Other reviewers here have excellent season and episode summaries so I won't bother butMy Personal highlights this season-Kimmy working her way back into everyone's trust by showing her sane side for most the season and then losing it again in true Melrose style by the season finale!,Alison going for Brooke's daddy!,Brooke being her usual spiteful and manipulative self until being axed mid season,Billy changing into a male Brooke after her death,Jane becoming a stronger and more manipulative force after being duped by so many sleazy guys in the past, she really knew what she want this season and went for it!Sydney being Sydney! Cunning and devious as always and showing everyone not to write her off as a young wannabe in their world.Anyways, I hope u all enjoy reliving this season regardless of poor packaging and no extras etc..",4,My fave season of Melrose on dvd at last,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,4346,"['Hey', 'everyone', 'So', 'thankfully', 'wait', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'Season', '4', 'sets', 'have', 'arrived.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', '34', 'episodes', 'set', 'now', 'have', 'started-', 'season', '4', 'was', 'season', 'discovered', 'MP', 't.v', 'remained', 'fave', 'one', 'caught', 'up', 'seasons', '1-3', 'seeing', 'rest', 'series', 'seasons', '5-7', 'best', 'season', 'really', 'pushed', 'characters', 'new', 'extremes', 'time', 'best', 'season', 'characters', 'Jane', 'Kimberly', 'mass', 'exodus', 'occurred', 'end', 'last', 'truly', 'great', 'season', 'season', 'five', '.I', 'agree', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'saying', 'release-', 'poor', 'indeed', 'time', 'many', 'ways', 'namely', 'poor', 'packaging', 'extras', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'me.I', 'know', 'everything', 'release', 'cheap', 'basic', 'end', 'day', 'packaging', 'little', 'dvds', 'contain', 'real', 'content', 'are', 'buying', '34', 'season', '4', 'episodes', 'are', 'present', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'complaints', 'quality', 'episodes', 'sure', 'are', 'not', 'mega-pixled', 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'such', 'technologies', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', 'time', 'filming', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'quality', 'episodes', 'are', 'here', 'condition', 'aired', 't.v', 'originally.Yes', 'cover', 'pictures', 'are', 'blurry', 'packaging', 'sloppy', 'careless', 'avoidable', 'big', 'prob', 'dvds', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'grey', 'time-', 'again', 'not', 'end', 'world', 'actually', 'i', 'think', 'look', 'better', 'other', 'sets', 'episode', 'summaries', 'are', 'gone', 'too-', 'big', 'issue', 'anyway', 'know', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'new', 'way', 'storing', 'dvds', 'too-', 'i', 'too', 'prefer', 'separate', 'boxes', 'i', 'suppose', 'cheaper', 'CBS', 'DVD', 'better', 'environment', 'too', 'i', 'know', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'holders', 'were', 'broken', 'inside', 'when', 'got', 'mine', 'arrived', 'fully', 'intact', 'way', 'ireland', 'new', 'zealand', 'should', 'be', 'okay', 'get', 'em', 'one', 'piece', 'extras', 'well', 'are', 'none', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'ones', 'previous', 'sets', 'were', 'just', 'lame', 'attempts', 'make', 'think', 'were', 'getting', 'something', 'extra', 'really', 'were', 'scenes', 'season', 'edited', 'little', 'clip', 'shows', 'fancy', 'little', 'titles', 'make', 'look', 'something', 'interesting', 'So', 'no', 'extras', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'some/', 'found', 'old', 'footage', 'etc', 'why', 'would', 'bother', 'figure', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'grateful', 'are', 'getting', 'further', 'releases', 'all.I', 'really', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'abandon', 'series-', 'least', 'not', 'last', 'good', 'season', 'five', 'released', 'could', 'easily', 'do', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'releasing', 'anymore', 'already', 'region', 'stopped', 'season', 'two', ""'m"", 'region', '2', 'dvds', 'substantial', 'market', 'taking', 'Europe', 'Japan', 'South', 'Africa', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'annoyed', 'more', 'Melrose', 'being', 'made', 'available', 'here', 'other', 'late-night', 'soaps', 'Knot', 'Landing', 'have', ""n't"", 'sold', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'abandoned', 'entirely', 'too.I', 'mean', 'last', 'three', 'seasons', 'hardly', 'were', 'bestsellers', 'guess', 'CBS', 'DVD', 'other', 'big', 'commercial', 'company', 'just', 'thinking', 'bottom', 'line-', 'profit', 'So', 'things', 'considered', 'just', 'feel', 'lucky', 'am', 'able', 'get', 'hands', 'more', 'episodes/', 'seasons', 'show.As', 'show', 'well', 'like', 'anyone', 'else', 'buying', 'figure', 'already', 'what', 'are', 'getting-', '34', 'gripping', 'episodes', 'one', 'best', '90', 't.v', 'shows', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'excellent', 'season', 'episode', 'summaries', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'butMy', 'Personal', 'highlights', 'season-Kimmy', 'working', 'way', 'back', 'everyone', 'trust', 'showing', 'sane', 'side', 'most', 'season', 'then', 'losing', 'again', 'true', 'Melrose', 'style', 'season', 'finale', 'Alison', 'going', 'Brooke', 'daddy', 'Brooke', 'being', 'usual', 'spiteful', 'manipulative', 'self', 'being', 'axed', 'mid', 'season', 'Billy', 'changing', 'male', 'Brooke', 'death', 'Jane', 'becoming', 'stronger', 'more', 'manipulative', 'force', 'being', 'duped', 'so', 'many', 'sleazy', 'guys', 'past', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'want', 'season', 'went', 'Sydney', 'being', 'Sydney', 'Cunning', 'devious', 'always', 'showing', 'everyone', 'not', 'write', 'off', 'young', 'wannabe', 'world.Anyways', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'reliving', 'season', 'regardless', 'poor', 'packaging', 'extras', 'etc..']",Melrose Place: Season 4
1132027,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B0011NVCAM,JGC,"[30, 36]","""Melrose Place"" was my very favorite show during my teen years. I absolutely obsessed over this show because it was so addictive. Each Season, it got better and better and more dramatic and over-the-top. Also, unlike most primetime shows, ""Melrose"" produced many more eps per season.Clickhereto see a picture of the back of the cover of the Season 4 set, as well as a picture of the Season 4 girls!Season Four of ""Melrose"" was in full swing. Throughout Season Four the storylines just got more and more outrageous. The Season Premiere starts out with a bang, literally! It picks up exactly where Season Three left off - with that kook, Kimberly (Marcia Cross) in the middle of the courtyard threatening to blow everyone to smithereens! When Kimberly presses the detonator all pandemonium breaks out!Incidentally, what was up with the Season Four haircuts? IMO some of them were really hideous. Especially Jane's. Yuuuuck! According to the site, ""Melrose Space"" they have dubbed Season Four, ""lawnmower hair,"" explaining that, ""The horrendous Season 4 haircuts of Jane, Jake and Matt that look like they were done by a blind man using a weed wacker."" Very true!!Overall, my favorite character is Kimberly. Because, Kimberly is like theCartmanof ""Melrose."" You just love her because she is such a horrible person with zero redeeming qualities. She is a conniving, spiteful witch. Oh, but you say she's crazy? I say crazy like a fox. This woman knew how to go nuts whenever it was most convenient for her. And, the fact that Kimberly became a psychiatrist was absolutely mindboggling; she really should have bottled that nerve because it was such an anomaly.I also thought it was hilarious when Kimberly tried to go out of her way to be sweet and nice. In Season Four she desperately tried to befriend some of the tenants in the building. I loved when Matt (Doug Savant) said to her (probably the only clever line out of all 153 eps that he was in!,) ""a lot of people can't get passed the fact that you tried to blow us up."" So funny, because it was absolutely surreal that Kimberely was living there! And, I loved it when Kimberley befriended Syd (played the fiery redheaded, Laura Leighton). By the way, I still can't figure out who was crazier for going along with those foolish counseling sessions; Sydney or Kimberly...? These two were like Baby Jane and Blanche Hudson! Take one guess who Baby Jane was!Interestingly enough, this is the first Season where Marcia Cross is included during the opening credits. In prior Seasons her name was only shown as a guest star. I always found that fascinating because her part was much more important than many of the other ""stars"" of the show and Kimberly always had at least three times as much screen-time as a lot of the other ""Melose"" residents (namely, Matt.)I also loved all of Amanda's (played by the little vixen, Heather Locklear) problems and affairs. She hopped from bed to bed to bed to bed. Amanda was the type of woman who enjoyed the chase just as much as the game. Perhaps, to her the chase was what it was all about? I was a little disappointed that Jack Parezi (played by the super-sexxxy: Antonio Sabato Jr.) didn't stick around too long. He was only on 6 eps. (By the way, am I the only one who thought Amanda was a little long in the tooth for this super-hottie? She looked a good 10 years older than Jack.) And I never could understand why Amanda wanted nothing to do with him. This man was rich, young and devastatingly beautiful! But Amanda was really hot and heavy for Bobby (John Enos III.) Compared to Jack, Bobby was downright ugly.Never one to be understated, Brooke Campbell (n&eacute;e Armstrong,) (Kristin Davis) makes a huge splash in Season Four. Literally! For the first quarter (or half?) of the Season I despised her with a passion. Because she was a b iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch. But after Billy (Andrew Shue) and everyone deserted her I started to feel bad for her because here was a lonely, tragic lost soul. And as Alison (Courtney Thorne-Smith) put it, ""she doesn't have a friend in the world.""Speaking of Alison, I got so fed up with her during Season Four. Because as far as Billy and Brooke were concerned she totally tried to play both sides of the fence. She would try to be Brooke's friend one minute and then go on a date with Billy. No matter how nasty Brooke was that's still her man; Alison played a big part in the separation between Brooke and Billy. And this only made Alison come off as incredibly phony and dishonest.The only negative quality I can assert to Season Four is that this was really the beginning of the exodus. This was the final Season for one of my favorite characters, Jo Reynolds. I hated the way she was written off because it seemed like it was done in such a sloppy, hurried rush. And I couldn't stand that stupid know-nothing that played her love interest (Brad Johnson played Dr. Dominick O'Malley); he was no Jake Hanson (who was played by that very manly-man, Grant Show!) According to many published reports, Daphne Zuniga couldn't get out of there quick enough. She absolutely despised her final two seasons on this hit soap. And after Jo took off, Kimberly, Syd, Jake, Alison, Matt and eventually even Billy all departed in one way or another over the following two seasons! I also read elsewhere that all of the main actors who left wanted to leave, except for Andrew Shue, who was fired from the show at the end of Season Six.These are the Season Four Characters:Alison Parker (Courtney Thorne-Smith) - main castJo Reynolds (Daphne Zuniga) - main castAmanda Woodward (Heather Locklear) - this is the ""Star"" of the showJane Mancini (Josie Bissett) - main castJake Hanson (Grant Show) - main cast & the coolest man in the universe!!Dr. Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro) - main castBilly Campbell (Andrew Shue) - main castDr. Peter Burns (Jack Wagner) - main castSydney Andrews (Laura Leighton) - main castDr. Kimberly Shaw (Marcia Cross) - main castBrooke Campbell (n&eacute;e Armstrong) (Kristin Davis) - main cast, not on entire SeasonMatt Fielding (Doug Savant) - main castAlycia Barnett (Anne-Marie Johnson) - supporting/recurring, not on entire SeasonRichard Hart (Patrick Muldoon) - supporting/recurringBobby Parezi (John Enos III) - supporting/recurring, not on entire SeasonShelly Hanson (Hudson Leick) - supporting/recurring, not on entire SeasonHayley Armstrong (Perry King) - supporting/recurring, not on entire SeasonAnother Season Four character that I enjoyed was Alycia Barnett (Anne-Marie Johnson). Of course she wasn't a main character but I did find her addition to the cast to be a much needed shot of in-your-face narcissism. I liked how she had the gumption to go up against Amanda (more than once,) and perhaps this was one of the only times in the entire history of ""Melrose"" where Amanda was put in her place? But eventually Amanda got her man; or maybe I got that wrong? I suppose it would be more accurate to state that eventually Peter (Jack Wagner) got his girl and Alycia was left alone to contend with her bony self.Can we talk about the pr*ce of this set? As of today, the price of this set is 41 . 99 which is a very good price. If you're interested in buying this, I'd say place your order ASAP because I suspect the price will go up. Am@z**.com has a history of structuring their prices in a very odd way; they will offer low prices one day and the following day the prices will go up! (It reminds me of Expedia or Priceline.) None of the other ""Melrose"" sets are this cheap, either!Here's all the eps from Season Four:Post Mortem Madness, 9/11/1995Most of the victims have minor injuries. Except for Alison who is left blind and Mackenzie Hart who is killed. Jess dies from the fall he took with Jake.Melrose Is Like a Box of Chocolates, 9/18/1995Some of the tenants have to double up. I love it when Brooke pops into Jane's apartment (where Alison is staying) to warn her to keep her mitts off her man at the company event that they're all going to. Brooke even says to Alison in such a hateful way, ""pardon the pun, but I guess we won't be seeing you there...""Blind Ambition, 9/20/1995Alison regains her sight. And when she catches Brooke snooping in Amanda's office she pretends like she's still blind. I love it when Alison asks if anyone else is in the office and Brooke says to herself as Alison closes the door, ""nobody you blind b itch"" (said, with an emphasis on ""b itch."")Simply Shocking, 9/25/1995Brooke goes to Miami to dig up dirt on Amanda, then she uses the info to blackmail her. I especially got a big kick out it when Amanda put up that pathetic attempt to choke Brooke. She says to her in this really warped-sounding monotone voice, ""THOSE-WERE-MY-PERSONAL-FILES,"" as she has her hands wrapped around Brooke's neck. And with each syllable, Amanda walks forward (still keeping her hands tightly around Brooke's neck,) eventually pushing her up against the wall. Finally, she lets go, prompting Brooke to say in a startled way, ""I'm willing to respect that, I'm with you Amanda, a secret this good deserves to be kept...""Drawing Henry, 10/2/1995Kimberly makes some progress when her mother, Marion Shaw (Janet Carroll) comes to visit her. Back in normal-people's land, Jack comes to L.A. in search of his (estranged) wife. Incidentally, did you remember how Amanda looked at the very end in the airport when Jack finally caught up with her? The woman was enjoying every second of this little cat and mouse game. She loved the idea that this big, strong man was chasing after her.The Jane Mutiny, 10/9/1995Jane and Richard decide to stay engaged. As usual, Jo can't leave well enough alone and decides to stick her nose where it isn't wanted.Let the Games Begin, 10/16/1995Brooke recruits Jack as a D&D; client. Jack also shows his hot face at Amanda's impromptu party in the courtyard. Peter brings Kimberly to the party so she can ""apologize to everyone"" and Amanda says, ""have all the demons in hell come out to torment me."" I love it when the always-forgiving Jake says to Amanda ""let her talk Amanda."" Then after Kimberly apologizes like a good little lunatic (for blowing up the building and committing attempted mass-murder, not to mention murdering Mackenzie Hart...but no one cared about her) Amanda says, ""the damage has been done Kimberly, but if it means that much to you I accept your apology..."" No, you did not just enter the Twilight-Zone...Dial M for Melrose, 10/23/1995Amanda and Jack get into a fight with him falling. Maybe this ep should be titled: Dial M for Murder?Amanda Unplugged, 10/30/1995After getting drunk at a Halloween party, Amanda goes to bed with Peter.El Syd, 11/6/1995After Jack dies, Syd tries to blackmail Peter and Amanda. And she forces Michael to let her move back in. Alison marries Haley, becoming Billy's mother-in-law and Brooke's step-mother!Free Kimmy, 11/13/1995Alison gets suspicious of Haley while on their honeymoon.Kimberly Does L.A., 11/20/1995Kimberely is the victim of Vic's torment. This man really picked the wrong person to mess with. But wasn't it funny when he referred to has as a ""sleepy sl ut...?""Hook, Line and Hayley, 11/27/1995In a drunken stupor, Hayley falls off the boat. Kimberly has Peter ""smooth things over at the hospital"" so she can become a psychiatrist. Whoever said the patients are running the asylum sure got that right!Two Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 12/4/1995Brooke maliciously has the police investigate Alison in conjunction with her father's death. Meanwhile, Jake learns about Shelly's tricks and she is arrested. I love it when Jake goes to visit her at the jail and she comes out looking so different! And, when Jake says to her, "" go to hell,"" Shelly says, ""you're so screwed Jake,"" as she dramatically kisses the window separating them at the jail. So over-the-top!!!Oy! To the World, 12/11/1995Brooke learns that she was never pregnant but can't find the right words to tell her hubby.Holy Strokes, 1/1/1996Jane has a stroke and looks absolutely repugnant with that butchered canary-blonde haircut.The Brooke Stops Here, 1/8/1996Billy goes back to Brooke after her suicide attempt.Sydney, Bothered and Bewildered, 1/15/1996Brooke goes crazy and trashes Alison's place.The Bobby Trap, 1/22/1996Amanda's life is put on the line, thanks to her father-in-law.No Lifeguard on Duty (1), 2/5/1996Amanda tells Vince that Jack wasn't the man he thought he was.No Lifeguard on Duty (2), 2/5/1996This is one of my favorite eps. Brooke stays with Alison because she has nowhere else to go. When Amanda pops in and says to Alison, ""what's she doing here,"" Brooke retorts, ""there's always something I wanted to say to you Amanda, kiss my a ss."" This is immediately followed by Amanda saying, ""your fired."" I loooooove it!! Towards the end of the ep, Brooke resurfaces; totally snockered! When Billy and co. leave her she falls in the pool and bangs her head!Devil in a Wet Dress, 2/12/1996The gang all go to Brooke's funeral. Incidentally, I never understood why Syd went? I don't think she ever even knew Brooke, the two never spoke once.Circle of Strife, 2/19/1996Alison is outraged when Billy humiliates her in front of a client.Run Billy Run, 2/26/1996Billy goes to bed with a rival agency's executive so he can steal her ideas.Ruthless People, 3/4/1996Jo blackmails Jane into working with Richard again.The Burning Couch, 3/11/1996Bobby is arrested for hitting Peter.Triumph of the Bill, 3/18/1996Alison quits her job at D&D; (what is this like the 5th time?) because as usual her nose is a little out of joint when Billy bangs Mandy.What Comes Up, Must Come Down, 4/1/1996Alison goes to work for Jake, at Shooters.True Fibs, 4/15/1996Kimberly argues with Betsy (her ""other self"") who clocks Michael on the head.Melrose Unglued, 4/29/1996Amanda gets Teri Carson (Loni Anderson) to drop the charges against Peter. Bobby lures Alycia to Peter's office to confront her. BTW, I love the way Bobby says to Alycia (as she comes storming into Peter's office) in this almost-playful voice, ""it's Booooooby."" He sounded so cute and timid. I guess Bobby liked role-playing, because when he left a message on Amanda's voicemail he also spoke in another sexy voice. This time he spoke much faster; talking in almost 1 syllable: ""It'sBobby!"" After fleeing the crime scene (Peter's office,) Alycia calls Wilshire Memorial looking for Peter. As Peter is being interogated by the cops he is paged and then dramaticaly goes running up to the nurses counter. And, Alycia tells him that she's leaving town, but agrees to come back to give the cops a statement and as she turns around she is hit by a truck!Peter's Excellent Adventure, 5/6/1996Kimberly resurfaces to take Peter capture at her coo-coo's nest. Meanwhile, Sydney was distraught over Bobby's death. It was cold, although oddly comical when Michael says to Syd, ""will you stop mourning over that dead gangster.""Full Metal Betsy, 5/15/1996Michael and Amanda join forces to go looking for Peter. Kimberly plans to have Peter lobotomized!Dead Sisters Walking (1), 5/20/1996Amanda and Michael disguise themselves as patients in the nut hospital (where Betsy/Kimberly is holding ""Mr. Peters"" hostage!) BTW, did you notice how well Amanda managed to blend in? (She really makes a good kook.) Speaking of going bonkers, I LOVED it when Amanda and Michael finally found Peter (he was strapped to a wheelchair) and they quickly try to leave (they were in some type of wreck room where all the lunatics congregate.) Amanda is literally rolling for her life and poor Peter is totally out of it (Kimberly must have given him something to heavily sedate him.) All of a sudden Kimberly enters and Amanda and company all get this horrified look on their faces (especially Amanda, as she dramatically pulls the wheelchair back!) And Kimberly says to them in her best Betsy voice, ""end of the line, psychos."" Now if that ain't the psychotic-pot calling the kettle black I don't know what is! Kimberly goes even more nuts and has Michael, Amanda and Peter locked up in the hospital boiler room. I love it when Amanda says, ""someone should have her lobotomized."" The King's ex-wife, Priscilla Presley, shows up as Nurse Benson in this nut-house. I'm not sure which is worse, her horrible dye-job (that looks like it was done with a mixture of Crayola crayons and an old bottle of fire engine red nail polish) or her horrific acting. Take special notice when Priscilla Presley comes to the boiler room to bail them out, she messes up her lines at least 2 or 3 times! My Gawd...! I wonder how many takes Charlie Correll (the director) had to do just to get that? But in a way, I enjoyed it because it adds an extra element of drama (drama queens like me can never get enough of this!)Dead Sisters Walking (2), 5/20/1996Peter is arrested for Bobby's murder and his only alibi is that whack-job, Kimberly, who, conveniently drifts into a coma! Jane blackmails Sydney into being her coconspirator so she can kill Richard. I especially like it when Jane says to Syd, ""I believe in the devil and you're gonna help me kill him."" The second-parter is nowhere near as good as the first part (this was actually 1 show that's 2 hours long.) Because it tends to ""tie"" everything up into a neat little package and explain some of the storylines that weren't as ""tidy"" in the first half of this ep. IMHO this should have been saved for the Season Five Premiere, instead.I look forward to getting the Season Four set and subsequent other sets of ""Melrose"" (it was on for Seven racy Seasons.) And, I can't wait for Season Five of ""Melrose"" to come out. In Season Five, we meet Taylor McBride (Lisa Rinna.) This big-lip, hot-mama is not to be missed! Here's hoping  Paramount will finally release ""Models."" Do you remember this short-lived soapy drama? It was a spin-off of ""Melrose,"" and was almost as provocative and sensational. But it was gone after just one Season.With the help of ""Melrose Place,"" Mondays can still always be a real......B-i-t-c-h!",5,"The Season of  ~  Super-Sexxxy Estranged-hubbies, Impromptu Lobotomies,

1132029,ARTJT8SZV2CQJ,B0011NVCAM,KS62,"[2, 5]","I ordered this and after reading some of the comments i had expected to receive a flimsy case. What i did receive was a more than acceptable sturdy, hard plastic case. Infact it is easier to get to the discs with this case and i think it would be easier to damage the older cases from seasons 1-3.Those cases always get dinged corners, that certainly won't happen with the new cases. Also the new cases keep the discs securely in place even if you might a slight clanking sound. I have seen cases that were simlilar to these but, those cases were black and very flimsy and basically crap. The Melrose cases are white and very sturdy. It is the same case that Family Ties and Dynasty use.If you received a broken or cracked case i would have to think it was defective to begin with or was not very properly prepared before shipping. All my Dvds i receive from Amazon are always shrink wrapped to a sturdy piece of cardboard that's larger than the Dvd case and then it's put in a box that doesn't allow it to flop around during shipping.It is true that you do have to remove the discs or the paper insert (which is easy) to look at the episode info. And sadly they now only state the episode title and air date with no episode description. However, on a show like this you would be watching it in order and not looking for a specific episode.I'm just thrilled to be able to have this wonderfully trashy show available on Dvd and also have it in complete seasons.

Sure it's trashy; but in a good way.  It's my guilty pleasure and I really enjoy watching it over again.  It's highly addictive so be warned - and if you are a fan of any kind of soap opera or late night trash serial show, then this is for you.  It's so much fun and I can't wait for my copy to arrive.  I love it.",5,So addictive ;-O,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,28555,"['ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'Melrose', 'used', 'watch', 'religiously', 'TV', 'now', 'as', 'soon', 'released', 'DVD', ""'m"",

1132032,AQC4FLH1BQ04C,B0011NVCAM,Mikey Mike,"[2, 2]","Season four picks up with the highly explosive conclusion to the season three finale, catapulting the residents of 4616 Melrose into different directions.  Despite an extra disc (9 instead of 8 as with the previous three seasons depsite the same number of episodes per season), there are no excitable extras to be found.  C'mon CBS, pick up the slack.  How about cast interviews about filming the explosion of the apartment building, or interviews with the actors who departed this season (Daphne Zuniga, Kristin Davis).  This was the hottest show on TV in the mid-90s and I'm sure there are hours and hours of interview footage that could have been placed on this package.  I'm guessing the 9th disc is also the reason for the change in packaging to hard plastic.  I'm not entirely sure I like it as there are no episode descriptions on the package like the three previous releases in this series.The show itself takes a glossier turn in season four.  Hairstyles, wardrobe, make-up and sets make the series less gritty than seasons one, two, and three.  Sadly the grit is missed.  However, overall, season four was fantastic.  The cast additions are dead-on, even though it's highly unfair Marcia Cross' name was not included in the season three opening credits (her storylines in season three were far more important to the series than other cast regulars).Season Four is definitely a great buy.  I give it five stars.

It does suck that there are no episode summaries on the back and no features on the discs like the other seasons.Season 4 of MP is boring, confusing and the ""let's kill off this character"" routine is getting old. I find it hard to believe Amanda was once married and her husband beat her and he stalked Brooke to see what she wanted. And I don't understand the whole cable company part at all. And how could Bobby just crash thru the window? *rolls eyes at that storyline* And this whole thing with Jane and Richard - one minute they're partners, next minute they're not. And how does Kimberly blow up half the building, which resulted in a death, and she doesn't serve prison time, instead gets out and becomes a DJ and a psychiatrist intern?? That prostitute ring Sydney worked for in 2nd season was on TV when they got busted, surely an explosion would have made their news! No one would've hired Kim. I know it's just tv, but at least in season one, the episodes taught lessons.I don't even think I'm gonna bother buying season 5.",2,Boring and confusing,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,1077,"['others', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'packaging', 'suck', 'are', 'episode', 'summaries', 'back', 'features', 'discs', 'other', 'seasons.Season', '4', 'MP', 'boring', 'confusing', 'let', 'kill', 'off', 'character', 'routine', 'getting', 'old', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'Amanda', 'was', 'once', 'married', 'husband', 'beat', 'stalked', 'Brooke', 'see', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'whole', 'cable', 'company', 'part', 'how', 'could', 'Bobby', 'just', 'crash', 'thru', 'window', '*rolls', 'eyes', 'storyline*', 'whole', 'thing', 'Jane', 'Richard', 'one', 'minute', ""'re"", 'partners', 'next', 'minute', ""'re"", 'not', 'how', 'Kimberly', 'blow', 'up', 'building', 'resulted', 'death', ""n't"", 'serve', 'prison', 'time', 'instead', 'out', 'DJ', 'psychiatrist', 'intern', 'prostitute', 'ring', 'Sydney', 'worked', '2nd', 'season', 'was', 'TV', 'when', 'got', 'busted', 'surely', 'explosion', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'news', 'one', 'would', ""'ve"", 'hired', 'Kim', 'know', 'just', 'tv', 'least', 'season', 'one', 'episodes', 'taught', 'lessons.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', ""'m"", 'gon', 'bother', 'buying', 'season', '5']",Melrose Place: Season 4
