240798,A18BD98SU49UB7,6300277089,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[12, 13]","Anne of Green Gables tells a series of events in the life of Anne, an orphan that is sent away from her adoption family after being blamed for the death of an old coot. No matter what she tries to accomplish, it seems she can't do it without a foul up. This movie is around the three hour range in length, but once you've seen it you will understand that time flies when your having fun! After she is dumped at the orphanage, the head mistress hears about an elderly couple that lives on Prince Edward Island in a town called Avonlea. They want to adopt a child and she thinks that Anne would be perfect for them. Anne keeps herself company until she leaves by talking to her reflection, her &quot;Window Friend&quot; Katie. After she arrives on P.E.I. she melts the heart of a man named Matthew (Richard Farnsworth), who is to be her new parent. After she jabberboxes on their journey through fields, around the Lake of Shining Waters, and the trail of endless lace (Names that she gives the stretches of landscape they pass) they soon arrive at Green Gables. Once inside, the reluctant Matthew reveals the red headed child to Marrila, his sister. She quickly becomes enraged, &quot;What is that!&quot; Then Matthew says, &quot;It's a girl.&quot; She says &quot;I can see that...where is the boy?&quot; He shrugs, &quot;Was no boy, just her.&quot; That is the setup for the film, and one of the biggest challenges for Anne to overcome: winning Marrila's heart. Also one of the funniest things happens when she tries to dye her hair &quot;A Beautiful, Raven, Black&quot; and it ends up green.

240800,A4PSENWF6S5LV,6300277089,"A. Dunn ""alligirl""","[1, 1]","I loved this movie as a child.  I have many great memories of watching it with cousins, my siblings and my mother.  I watched it quite a bit as I grew up, so I was a bit nervous to watch it again as an adult as many of the movies that I so loved as a child did not stand the test of time.  A lot of movies that seemed so fun and great when I was younger have turned out to be cheesy, bad effects that I can't look past now that I know better, horrible dialog that I understand more now and quite a few just don't make any sense now that I'm old enough to really understand them and see the details.  This is not the case with Anne of Green Gables.  I think that the main factor was the fact that it's a book adaptation of a timeless tale, so as long as you have an appreciation for the books (and period pieces) it won't let you down.  I think that this is probably one of the best book-to-screen adaptations I've ever seen.When I was younger I was always so happy that Anne had found a good home, but I hadn't really understood the true horror of her previous situations until I got older.  Yes, even when I was young it seemed awful that in her old homes they made Anne watch the younger kids, but I looked on that as she was forced to babysit and that wasn't all that bad.  Now, as an adult, I can truly see how awful it would have been for her. I understand and know the history of how orphans were treated, as if becoming orphans were their fault and not the fault of poor parenting or tragic circumstances.  And after someone in my life has been so deeply touched by adoption - although it's a lot more difficult these days than just sending word to 'pick up a boy' - I fully understand the meaning of what the Cuthberts did.  After the death of my own father I understand the death of Matthew more deeply and more profoundly now than when I was a child, when it was merely sad.This movie has truly grown up with me, where I can find new and significant meaning in it in a way that I didn't when I was younger.  That is a test of a truly good film, where you can find the parallels to your own life while also being entertained.I also enjoy the sequel, Anne of Avonlea, which has also taken on a new meaning for me as an adult.  I would recommend that one as well when watching this one but DO NOT watch the Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story, the third in the series.  While it was written and directed by the same man, and acted by (mostly) the same people it diverts completely from the plotlines of the books and makes little to no sense as a continuation of the first two films.",5,Great Adaptation,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,2596,"['loved', 'movie', 'child', 'have', 'many', 'great', 'memories', 'watching', 'cousins', 'siblings', 'mother', 'watched', 'quite', 'bit', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'bit', 'nervous', 'watch', 'again', 'adult', 'many', 'movies', 'so', 'loved', 'child', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'lot', 'movies', 'seemed', 'so', 'fun', 'great', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'cheesy', 'bad', 'effects', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'past', 'now', 'know', 'better', 'horrible', 'dialog', 'understand', 'more', 'now', 'quite', 'few', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'now', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'really', 'understand', 'see', 'details', 'not', 'case', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'think', 'main', 'factor', 'was', 'fact', 'book', 'adaptation', 'timeless', 'tale', 'so', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'appreciation', 'books', 'period', 'pieces', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'think', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'book-to-screen', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.When', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'always', 'so', 'happy', 'Anne', 'had', 'found', 'good', 'home', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'understood', 'true', 'horror', 'previous', 'situations', 'got', 'older', 'Yes', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'seemed', 'awful', 'old', 'homes', 'made', 'Anne', 'watch', 'younger', 'kids', 'looked', 'was', 'forced', 'babysit', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Now', 'adult', 'can', 'truly', 'see', 'how', 'awful', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'understand', 'know', 'history', 'how', 'orphans', 'were', 'treated', 'becoming', 'orphans', 'were', 'fault', 'not', 'fault', 'poor', 'parenting', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'someone', 'life', 'been', 'so', 'deeply', 'touched', 'adoption', 'lot', 'more', 'difficult', 'days', 'just', 'sending', 'word', ""'pick"", 'up', 'boy', 'fully', 'understand', 'meaning', 'what', 'Cuthberts', 'did', 'death', 'own', 'father', 'understand', 'death', 'Matthew', 'more', 'deeply', 'more', 'profoundly', 'now', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'when', 'was', 'merely', 'sad.This', 'movie', 'truly', 'grown', 'up', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'new', 'significant', 'meaning', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'test', 'truly', 'good', 'film', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'parallels', 'own', 'life', 'also', 'being', 'entertained.I', 'also', 'enjoy', 'sequel', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'also', 'taken', 'new', 'meaning', 'adult', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'watching', 'one', 'DO', 'NOT', 'watch', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Continuing', 'Story', 'third', 'series', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'same', 'man', 'acted', 'mostly', 'same', 'people', 'completely', 'plotlines', 'books', 'little', 'sense', 'continuation', 'first', 'two', 'films']",N/A
240801,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6300277089,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 38]","Films are amazing because they can literally take any shape, any sound, any form, and any size.  They are the chameleon of entertainment.  As a viewer, you cannot jump into a film with expectations, because due to the circumstances listed above, one may never know the particular outcome.  Films can arrive in forms of made-for-television releases, direct-to-DVD releases, or through mainstream venues.  It is a magical moment beginning a film through the ending - there is a level of unknown as well as random emotions throughout.  ""Anne of Green Gables"" was one of those surprise random moments for me where I didn't know what to expect, but went through a barrage of emotion before arriving to this conclusion.  In film, it may be clich&eacute; to say ""size does matter"", but with exploding budgets and timelines over 120 minutes, size is becoming a hot commodity in Hollywood.  ""Anne of Green Gables"" is one of those low budget, little screen book adaptations that literally takes every page and puts it in cinematic lights.  Carrying both positive and negative attributes, ""Anne of Green Gables"" takes three hours of your life, puts it in a made-for-TV blender, blends, and forces you to drink the resulting concoction.  How does it taste going down?  Don't worry - that is what I am here for.""Anne of Green Gables"" begins with Anne's life in an orphanage, living with uncaring foster parents, all the way through her lavish life with her new parents, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert.  She goes through the struggles of being an independent woman living in a prim and proper world.  Leading us as Anne is Megan Follows, a young girl with a television filled resume, who provides us with the shell of Anne, but not quite the full-body development.  Follows is my first experience with Anne, and since there is little to judge, I must admit she was follow-able, but not quite developed.  The words that she engulfed were charismatic, she defined the role, but when she walked, cried, or ran - she didn't seem to be that same Anne again.  Follows felt like a stage actress trapped in an invisible cinema box.  Either she wasn't allowed the explore all the elements, or she just didn't have to.  This film was your typical made-for-TV movie that didn't need actors escaping their shells because they had picturesque views and longevity on their side.  They were telling a story, not winning awards - and with this film it was obvious.  Don't yell - I did like what Follows did, I just didn't love her performance.  Perhaps a stack rankings of all the others that portrayed Anne would allow Fellows' performance to stand out, but watching this film alone - something just felt missing.  Richard Farnsworth's Matthew was another abandoned character, with no emotion and void of life.  Every time he opened his mouth, nothing of excitement protruded.  Colleen Dewhurst was the clich&eacute; angry woman, unwilling to change, yet something about Anne eventually brings her to a new understanding of life.  These two were the leading figures around Anne, and working together they provided a good story - but poorly developed characters.  There was minimal emotion surrounding them as they went from scene to scene.  For these actors, it was obviously a job; they allowed the movie to tell the story.Having never read the story of Anne and her adventures at Green Gables, director Kevin Sullivan should be commended for bringing such a drab story to life.  The adventures of the protagonist Anne includes minimal excitement, the clich&eacute; drunken friend, the death of a loved one, the adolescent blurts of English - all can be found in other films of this nature like ""Little House on the Prairie"" or any ""After School Special"", but Sullivan did bring some snippets of joy to this story.  He made it long, which allowed us to sink into the environment, believe that it was forced, and yet one can find simple joys in the stagy-ness of it all.  Sullivan's direction was impeccable; he took no risks, created nothing original, and played it by the book.  He allowed the story to grow, but again, there wasn't much story to grow.  Anne stays in one place, runs around everywhere, and grows an iconic challenge with a local boy who is equally as talented (and equally as drab).  I am not a pre-teen girl, I am missing the ""bosom"" friend, and obviously this film wasn't targeted towards my demographic, but it should still entertain.  Anyone who argues that they could sit through such lifeless characters must be first in line to the new Larry the Cable Guy film.  While I am drawing random tangents, my point is the meat was missing from this adventure.  The scenery was fantastic, the pacing was fluent, but our characters could not bring me to a second viewing.  Where was the passion in this film?  Why did Sullivan allow cardboard to grace his screen?Overall, ""Anne of Green Gables"" was a lengthy film, with cardboard characters, but a plethora of beautiful scenes.  There wasn't much music to talk about, outside of the same three chords played over and over again.  Richard Farnsworth proved yet again that his name filled his resume, while Megan Follows played her part while keeping within her self-proclaimed box.  As a reviewer of films, I want to see progression, development; strong single elements that make each film stand out from the cattle of the rest.  With this film it felt safe, it was a family film that took no risks, it felt like a Styrofoam box on the ocean - you really should take it out, but you worry about getting wet and sea creatures.  ""Anne of Green Gables"" was an 80s film without the pizzazz.  If I had a daughter who wanted to watch this film, I could hope it would help her sleep.  Coupled with the characters, the story is ironically bland, and even the director didn't push for risks.  It was a film.  I was happy when it was over, could never dream about watching it again, yet I can't fault it for anything dramatic.  It wasn't the greatest made-for-TV film, but there is little to complain about.It was sterile.  It was cardboard.  It was copper.Grade: ** 1/2 out of *****",3,A film for teachers that don't want to teach...,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,6108,"['Films', 'are', 'amazing', 'can', 'literally', 'take', 'shape',

I might suggest getting a DVD lens cleaner-I had the same problem with all of my DVD's before I got one, and now I never have the problem.The sound is pretty good and the extras are nice.  The full-length commentary is a treat.  My wife and I sat down to watch a little bit and ended up watching over two hours.  The director and editor shed a lot of fun light on the production.

Don't ask me why I missed it. But when I did finally get around to reading it, I followed it with the rest of the entire series. And I'm sort of doing that here: I have ""The Continuing Story"" for tomorrow. Both were done for Canadian television, and very well done indeed. All the characters looked very much as I imagined them, except the teacher who I had seen as younger and prettier.No doubt you've all known the story most of your lives. Anne was an orphan with flaming red hair who hated her hair, had a vivid imagination, was rather scatter-brained but very smart.Apparently in those days, at least in Canada, it was not necessary for people to actually adopt an orphan. They merely took them in, gave them a home, and were allowed to send them back if they didn't do as they were told. Apparently it was mostly to have cheap labor. She was in more than one home mostly to take care of the younger children, and eventually was sent to sister and brother Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert on Prince Edward Island. They had expected to get a boy to help Matthew take care of the farm, but they got Anne instead, and Matthew was content. He was a shy, gentle, wise old thing, very quiet but very attached to Anne from the beginning. Marilla was an old maid sort of old maid, crabby and demanding. But she had a good heart, and agreed with Matthew that they would keep Anne in spite of the error (of her gender) because they could raise her right, instead of the heathenish bringing up she had suffered so far.Diana Barry, the girl who lived next property over (not very close, because of all the fields and woods in between), becomes her ""bosom friend."" They go to a small country school at Avonlea which includes children of all ages. It seems to be literally a one-room school house, but I'm not certain of that. In any case, it is small. Gilbert Blythe, a handsome boy in the school, earns Anne's long-term enmity for calling her ""carrots,"" a reference to her red hair. She hates her red hair, and therefore takes a long, long time to admit that she likes Gilbert.There are many incidents, some amusing, some dramatic, and because Anne is Anne, some quite melodramatic. But nobody who reads the book or sees this movie can possibly avoid loving Anne. The girl who plays Anne is just right for the role.

I rented this movie for my mom (to surprise her; as I knew she likes this genre - drama -and society), and have never seen her laugh so much at a movie. This movie was a good bonding experience for me and my parents.This movie is about Anne, a red-haired girl who is orphaned at an early age and faces life's situations with a maturity and also innocence to admire, really. In this movie, I learned a lot about social interactions, character maturity, the beauty of wit, and the social/psychological differences between women and men. The beautiful, down-to-earth, and somehow sublimely wicked character of Anne has been a *therapeutic session* for me. Meditatively, I had sympathized with various emotions, thoughts, schemes from my own childhood, some of them which comprise the brokenness that I carry in this world's life, my brokenness as an imperfect child of God.The movie, has spectacular cinematography, historical era-clothes, language (lingo sometimes archaic), and culture (I guess 19th century Canada; Victorian era).

For my dad and mom, they enjoyed and laughed at all the social gaffe, innocent improprieties, Victorian hypocrisies, and the words & life-actions of a little girl who turns adolescent and changes people's lives around her - Anne of Green Gables.I look forward to the day when I will watch this movie with my future kids.

240820,APXZRLC8LO165,6300277089,Carly,"[60, 62]","&quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; is just a beautiful, beautiful film, well crafted, carefully thought out, and superbly acted. There really isn't anything bad that I can think to say about it; it's an amazing, magical, and altogether unforgettable film. I saw it for the first time when I was about nine or ten years old; now, at seventeen, I have come to appreciate its depth and innocence so much more. When I was younger and used to watch it, I loved laughing at Anne's funny and endearing antics in the first half of the movie; now that I'm older, I still love that aspect of the movie, but I can also better understand and appreciate Anne's blossoming into a beautiful young woman. I would say that any girl 12 or older can get the full feel of this movie, and believe me, all of those girls should do so if they want a wonderful and refreshing movie experience unlike any other (and that is the truth).&quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; is truly an engaging story of our beloved heroine Anne Shirley, a fiery, redheaded 13-year-old orphan looking for someone to love her (and put up with her!) Her whimsical outlook on life and her fascination with fantasy and imagery has made many people turn away out of frustration and sometimes even lack of heart. However, little Anne is given her own miracle when she is chosen to live with a family in the gorgeous town of Avonlea and ends up with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert quite by accident. The sweet and soft-spoken Matthew is immediately taken to her, but Marilla does not exactly intend to let this talkative, imaginative little girl open the key to her hidden affections. Fortunately, Anne manages to worm her way into everyone's heart, and it is not long before the stable love she is finally receiving begins to help her come into her own as a friend, student, and person. As she eventually comes to understand, accept, and grow through sometimes rocky friendships, difficult neighbors, and competition from her peers, Anne's transformation from a somewhat gawky little girl to a substantial woman of intelligence, maturity, and strength of character finally seeps through, leaving the viewer feeling as if they truly witnessed the positive change and growth of this charming young girl.Overall, I would rate this movie as easily being one of the most magical and amazing films of all time. Megan Follows comes through beautifully and brings the title character of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; to life in her own unique way. She is a notable actress with great potential and has a seemingly flawless ability to enter Anne's world of confusion, passion, and success. Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth give strongly acted and emotionally accurate performances as Marilla and Matthew. Also rounding out the main cast are Jonathan Crombie as Anne's faithful and somewhat desperate admirer Gilbert Blythe (you will fall absolutely in love with his character); Schuyler Grant as Anne's faithful best friend Diana Barry; and the priceless Patricia Hamilton as Rachel Lynde, Anne's busybody neighbor. The lighthearted and tender story intertwined with the scenery and gorgeous shots of Avonlea make this a perfect choice for the entire family. Sadly, there just aren't very many films like this being made right now; we all know what the dominant themes of today's movies are, and none of them come even close to what you see in &quot;Anne of Green Gables.&quot; This is a gem of a movie and certainly one to include in your video collection. If you like any kind of movie about family, courage, love, and all that good stuff, then &quot;Anne&quot; might be the very best you could get. I recommend every piece of this heartfelt film; it is time and money VERY well spent and is the heart and soul of innocence and love.",5,beyond beautiful,1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,3778,"['quot', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'quot', 'just', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'film', 'well', 'crafted', 'carefully', 'thought', 'out', 'superbly', 'acted', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'bad', 'can', 'think', 'say', 'amazing', 'magical', 'altogether', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'nine', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'seventeen', 'have', 'come', 'appreciate', 'depth', 'innocence', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'used', 'watch', 'loved', 'laughing', 'Anne', 'funny', 'endearing', 'antics', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'now', ""'m"", 'older', 'still', 'love', 'aspect', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'better', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'Anne', 'blossoming', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'would', 'say', 'girl', '12', 'older', 'can', 'get', 'full', 'feel', 'movie', 'believe', 'girls', 'should', 'do', 'so', 'want', 'wonderful', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'experience', 'other', 'truth', 'quot', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'quot', 'truly', 'engaging', 'story', 'beloved', 'heroine', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'fiery', 'redheaded', '13-year-old', 'orphan', 'looking', 'someone', 'love', 'put', 'up', 'whimsical', 'outlook', 'life', 'fascination', 'fantasy', 'imagery', 'made', 'many', 'people', 'turn', 'away', 'frustration', 'sometimes', 'even', 'lack', 'heart', 'However', 'little', 'Anne', 'given', 'own', 'miracle', 'when', 'chosen', 'live', 'family', 'gorgeous', 'town', 'Avonlea', 'up', 'Marilla', 'Matthew', 'Cuthbert', 'quite', 'accident', 'sweet', 'soft-spoken', 'Matthew', 'immediately', 'taken', 'Marilla', 'not', 'exactly', 'intend', 'let', 'talkative', 'imaginative', 'little', 'girl', 'open', 'key', 'hidden', 'affections', 'Fortunately', 'Anne', 'worm', 'way', 'everyone', 'heart', 'not', 'long', 'stable', 'love', 'finally', 'receiving', 'begins', 'help', 'come', 'own', 'friend', 'student', 'person', 'eventually', 'understand', 'accept', 'grow', 'sometimes', 'rocky', 'friendships', 'difficult', 'neighbors', 'competition', 'peers', 'Anne', 'transformation', 'somewhat', 'gawky', 'little', 'girl', 'substantial', 'woman', 'intelligence', 'maturity', 'strength', 'character', 'finally', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'truly', 'witnessed', 'positive', 'change', 'growth', 'charming', 'young', 'girl.Overall', 'would', 'rate', 'movie', 'easily', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'magical', 'amazing', 'films', 'time', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'beautifully', 'title', 'character', 'quot', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'quot', 'life', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'notable', 'actress', 'great', 'potential', 'seemingly', 'flawless', 'ability', 'enter', 'Anne', 'world', 'confusion', 'passion', 'success', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'give', 'strongly', 'acted', 'emotionally', 'accurate', 'performances', 'Marilla', 'Matthew', 'Also', 'rounding', 'out', 'main', 'cast', 'are', 'Jonathan', 'Crombie', 'Anne', 'faithful', 'somewhat', 'desperate', 'admirer', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'will', 'fall', 'absolutely', 'love', 'character', 'Schuyler', 'Grant', 'Anne', 'faithful', 'best', 'friend', 'Diana', 'Barry', 'priceless', 'Patricia', 'Hamilton', 'Rachel', 'Lynde', 'Anne', 'busybody', 'neighbor', 'lighthearted', 'tender', 'story', 'intertwined', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'Avonlea', 'make', 'perfect', 'choice', 'entire', 'family', 'Sadly', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'right', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'dominant', 'themes', 'today', 'movies', 'are', 'none', 'come', 'even', 'close', 'what', 'see', 'quot', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables.', 'quot', 'gem', 'movie', 'certainly', 'one', 'include', 'video', 'collection', 'like', 'kind', 'movie', 'family', 'courage', 'love', 'good', 'stuff', 'then', 'quot', 'Anne', 'quot', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'best', 'could', 'get', 'recommend', 'piece', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'time', 'money', 'VERY', 'well', 'spent', 'heart', 'soul', 'innocence', 'love']",N/A

He cleaned it up structurally, and, best of all, deepened and enriched some of the major characters, most notably Gilbert who tends to get lost in the series as a sort of semi-defined &quot;shadow person.&quot;  Sullivan deftly handles the Victorian melodrama and Follows gives a no-nonsense performance of a character that could have come off as so dreamy and unrealistic as to be sickening.  There's nothing sickening here, however.  The film is pitch-perfect throughout.  It is true to its era, it is meticulously and humorously scripted, and brilliantly acted.  Dewhurst and Farnsworth are revelations in their roles.  This is a superior production that creates such a sense of genuine, earned warmth (right down to the lovely music score) that you will be compelled to watch it again and again.

Pawl ""Dani""","[7, 7]","This great 1985 production gloriously brings the characters from the ""Anne"" series, written by Canadian writer Lucy Maude Montgomery, to life.  I remember well watching (and reading) this story as a small child.  It was magical, then, and it remains so more than twenty years later.  Anne (Megan Follows) is a lively and strong-willed orphan adopted by Marilla (Colleen Dewhurst) and Matthew (Richard Farnsworth) Cuthbert, siblings in need of a helper on their farm.  Originally, they had expected to adopt a boy, but fate has other plans for them.  Anne proves to be just what they needed.  She brings them her youth, indomitable spirit and flare for getting into mischief.  Along the way, Anne meets and befriends neighbor and classmate Diana Berry (Schuyler Grant) and butts heads with ""would be"" suitor Gilbert Blythe (Jonathan Crombie).  Anne's slew of adventures and misadventures are a lot of fun to watch (especially an instance where she attempts to die her red hair auburn--turning it green instead!).The strength of this wonderful film is in the engaging acting, warm direction from Kevin Sullivan and the luscious photography.  You really feel like you have been transported to Prince Edward Island in Canada, in the early 1900s.  You'll laugh, you'll feel the pangs and poignance of Anne's trials and tribulations and you will absolutely lose yourself in the story.",5,"beautiful, intelligent and delightfully entertaining.......",1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,1378,"['great', '1985', 'production', 'gloriously', 'characters', 'Anne', 'series', 'written', 'Canadian', 'writer', 'Lucy', 'Maude', 'Montgomery', 'life', 'remember', 'well', 'watching', 'reading', 'story', 'small', 'child', 'was', 'magical', 'then', 'so', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Anne', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'lively', 'strong-willed', 'orphan', 'adopted', 'Marilla', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Matthew', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Cuthbert', 'siblings', 'need', 'helper', 'farm', 'Originally', 'had', 'expected', 'adopt', 'boy', 'fate', 'other', 'plans', 'Anne', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'youth', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'flare', 'getting', 'mischief', 'way', 'Anne', 'meets', 'befriends', 'neighbor', 'classmate', 'Diana', 'Berry', 'Schuyler', 'Grant', 'heads', 'would', 'be', 'suitor', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'Jonathan', 'Crombie', 'Anne', 'slew', 'adventures', 'misadventures', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'especially', 'instance', 'where', 'die', 'red', 'hair', 'auburn', 'turning', 'green', 'instead', '.The', 'strength', 'wonderful', 'film', 'engaging', 'acting', 'warm', 'direction', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'luscious', 'photography', 'really', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'transported', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'Canada', 'early', '1900s', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'pangs', 'poignance', 'Anne', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'will', 'absolutely', 'lose', 'story']",N/A

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","This 2001 ""Anne of Green Gables"" is the DVD version of the superb 1986 Canadian television adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved novel by Sullivan Entertainment.  It is blessed with terrific casting, excellent production values, and a surprisingly faithful visual translation of the original novel.Megan Follows is superb as the redhaired Anne, a spirited and imaginative young orphan who comes to live with a middle-aged bachelor farmer and his spinster sister (in spot-on performances by Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst).  Jonathan Crombie is entirely credible as Gilbert Blythe, Anne's childhood rival and patient would-be sweetheart.  This three-hour production works in screen appearences by most of the characters from ""Anne of Green Gables"", including Mrs. Rachel Lynde, Diana Barrett, Josie Pye, the teacher Miss Stacey, among others.Authentic sets and lushly beautiful location shooting in Prince Edward Island and Ontario, Canada, add immensely to the visual appeal of the film.  Green Gables farm itself, Avonlea's one-room schoolhouse, and the White Sands Hotel seem just as described in the novel.Even die-hard Anne fans should appreciate the remarkably seamless translation of novel to screen.  Inevitably, the storyline has been compressed, and the order of a few events have been changed, but many scenes and whole swaths of dialogue are reproduced.  Some scenes have been redone, but the changes seem faithful to the author's intent.  For example, the episode in which an embarrassed Matthew purchases Anne's first pretty dress is now staged entirely at the store, with the aid of store clerk Alice Lawson.  The priceless closing scene, in which Anne finally acknowledges her friendship with Gilbert, allows the actors to show the feelings implied in the original text.The ""Anne of Green Gables"" DVD is very highly recommended to fans of the ""Anne-girl"" of all ages.",5,Anne of Green Gables Comes To Life...,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,1898,"['2001', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'DVD', 'version', 'superb', '1986', 'Canadian', 'television', 'adaptation', 'Lucy', 'Maud', 'Montgomery', 'beloved', 'novel', 'Sullivan', 'Entertainment', 'blessed', 'terrific', 'casting', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'surprisingly', 'faithful', 'visual', 'translation', 'original', 'novel.Megan', 'Follows', 'superb', 'redhaired', 'Anne', 'spirited', 'imaginative', 'young', 'orphan', 'who', 'live', 'middle-aged', 'bachelor', 'farmer', 'spinster', 'sister', 'spot-on', 'performances', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Jonathan', 'Crombie', 'entirely', 'credible', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'Anne', 'childhood', 'rival', 'patient', 'would-be', 'sweetheart', 'three-hour', 'production', 'works', 'screen', 'appearences', 'most', 'characters', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'including', 'Mrs.', 'Rachel', 'Lynde', 'Diana', 'Barrett', 'Josie', 'Pye', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Stacey', 'others.Authentic', 'sets', 'lushly', 'beautiful', 'location', 'shooting', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'Ontario', 'Canada', 'add', 'immensely', 'visual', 'appeal', 'film', 'Green', 'Gables', 'farm', 'Avonlea', 'one-room', 'schoolhouse', 'White', 'Sands', 'Hotel', 'seem', 'just', 'as', 'described', 'novel.Even', 'die-hard', 'Anne', 'fans', 'should', 'appreciate', 'remarkably', 'seamless', 'translation', 'novel', 'screen', 'Inevitably', 'storyline', 'been', 'compressed', 'order', 'few', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'many', 'scenes', 'whole', 'swaths', 'dialogue', 'are', 'reproduced', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'redone', 'changes', 'seem', 'faithful', 'author', 'intent', 'example', 'episode', 'embarrassed', 'Matthew', 'purchases', 'Anne', 'first', 'pretty', 'dress', 'now', 'staged', 'entirely', 'store', 'aid', 'store', 'clerk', 'Alice', 'Lawson', 'priceless', 'closing', 'scene', 'Anne', 'finally', 'friendship', 'Gilbert', 'actors', 'show', 'feelings', 'implied', 'original', 'text.The', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'DVD', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Anne-girl', 'ages']",N/A

It's the kind of movie that you can watch with your whole family and everyone can enjoy it for some reason or another. Avonlea is displayed BEAUTIFULLY, and little Anne's spirit lightens up the whole movie. Megan Follows is a truly wonderful actress, and her luminous talent produces Anne Shirley, a memorable character that you will never forget. At the beginning of the movie, she is a talkative and heartening little orphan who comes to live with Marilla Cuthbert and her brother Matthew in Green Gables on Prince Edward Island. By the time the film reaches its conclusion, she has blossomed into an intelligent, mature, and levelheaded young adult. But watching her gradually make the transformation throughout the movie is a pure joy. What can I say? This is Anne Shirley--a hilariously funny, sweet, lovable, smart, and feisty girl who is always getting into trouble, but worms her way into everyone's heart. This movie is a winner, a classic. There's a little bit of humor, a little bit of sadness, and a whole lot of entertainment packed into this one film. Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst, Jonathan Crombie, and Richard Farnsworth round up the main cast, and their acting is superb.

There is, of course, pathos in this tale.  It comes, after all, from an era when orphans carried a stigma, when they could be adopted as cheap labor, when the disapproval of a single busybody could cast a pall over the entire span of a person's narrow social sphere, and when the isolation of rural existence could crust over even the gentlest souls.  But it also comes from an era when conversation and the quiet observation of nature were not drowned out by pop music, television, and rapid transit -- when the little joys of getting a new dress, or brewing one's own elderberry wine, or getting to attend an after-church social planted a much larger footprint on one's day, week, or month.Usually when I first encounter a piece of literature in its filmed iteration, I am compelled to seek out the &quot;real&quot; thing to flesh out the characters and themes.  Not so with Anne of Green Gables.  After having watched this miniseries every few months since it first came out on laserdisc years ago, Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst, Richard Farnsworth and others of this phenomenal cast are, in the characters they portray, so much my friends and soulmates that I cannot imagine taking the risk of having them supplanted by their book counterparts.  It would be an unthinkable disloyalty to the warmest souls ever to grace a TV screen.  I'm a busy professional without much time for a fantasy life.

Each of these  actors perfectly portrays the characters of the orphan red-haired Anne  Shirley, aging brother and sister, Muerilla and Mathew.  All of the  supporting cast artfully, delightfully, and superbly bring the other  essential  characters to life as well. Anne Shirley is an orphan in  Northern Canada on Prince Edward Island who gets shipped from home to home  serving households in order to earn her keep. But Anne is a gifted soul who  longs for someone to happily listen to her and joyfully love her.  Thirteen  year old Anne is ecstatic when she learns that she is finally going to have  a home where she will not have to raise dozens of children. When she  arrives by train, she waits patiently until the extremely shy Mathew comes  to fetch her in his horse and buggy. What Anne doesn't know is that Mathew  and his sister are expecting a boy who can help with the chores. The always  exhuberant Anne is so loquacious and grateful for her new home that Mathew  doesn't have the opportunity nor the heart to break the news to the child  he comes to adore on the buggy ride back to his home, Green Gables.

240850,AQ01Q3070LT29,6300277089,James McDonald,"[2, 2]","This first film is a must-see if you want your little girl to grow up to be a proper lady.Anne Shirley is a girl of thirteen who as an orphan was eventually sent to live with the Hammonds by a neighbor.  The Hammond woman has so many children and babies to take care of. The stress level is so high all that the woman can do is badger Anne.Anne really is a nice girl.  She reads proper books and through these books she is able to convey her feelings to other people.  There is not one bad bone in Anne.  Always polite and still has an innocent sense of wonder.After Mr. Hammond dies unexpectedly, Mrs. Hammond decides she no longer wants Anne and continues to bad-mouth Anne.  So back to the Fairview Orphange she goes.  mrs. Hammond also practically left her there without another word of it.  The orphange didn't have room for Anne either.Near Bright River, Marilla (Colleen Dewhurst) is awaiting the arrival of a boy of 11 or 12 from the orphange, ""old enough to do the chores and young enough to be brought up properly"".  Well, there at the Bright River train depot is Anne waiting patiently.  The orphange sent her instead.  Mr. Matthew Cuthbert (Richard Farnsworth), Marilla's brother, thought the best thing to do is take her to her new home.  Marilla was not thrilled at all at the sight of Anne.  Marilla specifically wanted a boy for the hard work around the house.  She wants to take Anne back to the asylum, but Matthew says, ""We might be of some good to her"".Marilla finally comes to her senses and indeed Anne's new home of Green Gables becomes her steady home into adulthood, but there are many hurdles and tribulations Anne must deal with yet.Running Time: 3 hours, 14 min.Note: Megan Follows continued the role of ""Anne"" through 1999 in the third mini-series film.  Schuyler Grant and Jonathan Crombie also continued their roles.Jackie Burroughs (""Road To Avonlea""/""Tales of Avonlea"") makes an appearance as ""Amelia Evans""--The Actress.The story continues in:Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel (1987)Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story (2000)Separatly, The Disney Channel aired ""Road To Avonlea"" tv series (1989-1996), also with Colleen Dewhurst.

Here was a person who, like me, didn't really fit in, and yet she made the best of her situation and her imagination - what a role-model.  Now, almost twenty years later, I can still watch this miniseries and feel the fond memories and familiar aches of that long-ago identification.The story follows Anne (Megan Follows), an orphan who mistakenly gets sent to the remote and beautiful Prince Edward Island at the turn of the 20th century (Anne is supposed to be a boy, to help her adoptive `parents' with farmwork).  She develops bonds with her new family, as well as many members of the community, and goes on to college to foster her love of learning and writing.  Anyone who identifies this as a ""chick flick"" either has no imagination or is overly-cynical.  True, there is romance, but it's more a story of life rather than love.The DVD presentation is good - it's fullscreen (as it was shot), with some grain, but not too much.  There are a few deleted scenes, some Megan Follows screen tests (humorous, but unintentionally so), and a feature-length commentary.  Its too bad that the only way to get this great series on DVD is to import it; note that the next parts of the series, Anne of Avonlea (AKA Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel) and Anne 3 (the 2000 series that has the same cast, but doesn't really follow the book) are also available on DVD from Sullivan Entertainment, although they are much harder to find than this first part (and the quality of the video on those discs is pretty crummy).Final Grade: A-",5,Kindred Spirits,1025222400,"06 28, 2002",2002,1643,"['first', 'watched', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'when', 'was', 'third', 'grade', 'impact', 'had', 'life', 'was', 'immeasurable', 'Here', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'yet', 'made', 'best', 'situation', 'imagination', 'what', 'role-model', 'Now', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'can', 'still', 'watch', 'miniseries', 'feel', 'fond', 'memories', 'familiar', 'aches', 'long-ago', 'identification.The', 'story', 'Anne', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'orphan', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'sent', 'remote', 'beautiful', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'turn', '20th', 'century', 'Anne', 'supposed', 'be', 'boy', 'help', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'farmwork', 'bonds', 'new', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'members', 'community', 'college', 'foster', 'love', 'learning', 'writing', 'Anyone', 'who', 'chick', 'flick', 'imagination', 'overly-cynical', 'True', 'romance', 'more', 'story', 'life', 'rather', 'love.The', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'good', 'fullscreen', 'was', 'shot', 'grain', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'screen', 'tests', 'humorous', 'unintentionally', 'so', 'feature-length', 'commentary', 'too', 'bad', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'great', 'series', 'DVD', 'import', 'next', 'parts', 'series', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'AKA', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Sequel', '3', '2000', 'series', 'same', 'cast', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'book', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'DVD', 'Sullivan', 'Entertainment', 'are', 'much', 'harder', 'find', 'first', 'part', 'quality', 'video', 'discs', 'pretty', 'crummy', '.Final', 'Grade', 'A-']",N/A

After my wife finally finished it, I picked it up and could not put it down. The movie on this DVD is the same way. It sticks pretty well to the novel and only leaves out some scenes with the pastors wife.Meghan Follows should get a lifetime achievement award for this unforgettable performance.

Laurey,"[0, 0]","...If have any kind of appreciation for movies:  unless you're basically a Neanderthal who can't do anything but sports/war/action themes (not that there's anything wrong with that)you might be surprised at how much you'll like this production and its first sequel. I had no interest in the ""Anne of Green Gables""subject at all, for crying out loud---but my wife had always loved the books, and one night wanted to catch this production on PBS. Wanting to spend the evening with her no matter what she was doing, I sat through the thing and by the end, it had me hooked. This is very well put together, a classy yet down-home production that makes you feel like you're really in that time period. Sets, music, everything. Great cinematography. And the cast could not be more perfectly chosen: from bit parts to supporting roles to main characters--they make you believe they're real, and the dialogue--especially Anne's---is terrific. Purists will note some differences from the actual book series, but you'll get past that...even if only to watch ""cool as they come"" Richard Farnsworth and ""could-do-no-wrong"" Colleen Dewhurst interact with Megan Follows as Anne. This young actress is the crown jewel of the films---an amazing performance---and all of them deftly handle the clever script. Even though nearly every fan has seriously (and quite accurately !!) denounced the later chapters of this film series, director Kevin Sullivan hit real paydirt with the first two, ""Gables"" and ""Avonlea"". Of course, guys, if you just can't get past ""Rambo"", you might like the 3rd installment and get into that good old World War I crossfire.",5,"Surprise, guys !!!!",1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,1633,"['have', 'kind', 'appreciation', 'movies', ""'re"", 'basically', 'Neanderthal', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'sports/war/action', 'themes', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', ""'ll"", 'like', 'production', 'first', 'sequel', 'had', 'interest', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'subject', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', '-but', 'wife', 'had', 'always', 'loved', 'books', 'one', 'night', 'wanted', 'catch', 'production', 'PBS', 'Wanting', 'spend', 'evening', 'matter', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'sat', 'thing', 'end', 'had', 'hooked', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'classy', 'yet', 'down-home', 'production', 'feel', ""'re"", 'really', 'time', 'period', 'Sets', 'music', 'everything', 'Great', 'cinematography', 'cast', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'perfectly', 'chosen', 'bit', 'parts', 'supporting', 'roles', 'main', 'characters', 'make', 'believe', ""'re"", 'real', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'Anne', '-is', 'terrific', 'Purists', 'will', 'note', 'differences', 'actual', 'book', 'series', ""'ll"", 'get', 'even', 'only', 'watch', 'cool', 'come', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'could-do-no-wrong', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'interact', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'Anne', 'young', 'actress', 'crown', 'jewel', 'films', '-an', 'amazing', 'performance', '-and', 'deftly', 'handle', 'clever', 'script', 'Even', 'nearly', 'fan', 'seriously', 'quite', 'accurately', 'denounced', 'later', 'chapters', 'film', 'series', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'hit', 'real', 'paydirt', 'first', 'two', 'Gables', 'Avonlea', 'course', 'guys', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'Rambo', 'might', 'like', '3rd', 'installment', 'get', 'good', 'old', 'World', 'War', 'crossfire']",N/A

That's when I first seen Anne of Green Gables.  My mom told me about this movie that was on and I insisted I thought it was stupid.  Well, I've had to eat my words ever since!  She finally got me to watch it and watch it I did!!!  Over and over again.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched it in the past fifteen years.Anne of Green Gables is the story of Anne (spelled with an E) Shirley, an orphan girl who goes to live with an elderly brother and sister, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island.  She gets there only to find out there's been some mistake and the Cuthberts really wanted a boy, not a girl.  Marilla puts Anne through a trial period to see if they'll keep her.  Matthew falls in love with Anne on the way home from the train station and wants to keep her.  They decide to keep her and the rest of the movie is the story of her growing up with her bosom friend, Diana Barry, and her rival in school, Gilbert Blythe, and life with Matthew and Marilla on PEI.This is a wonderful movie.  Megan Follows is absolutely brillant.  She is charming and spirited and really brings to life the character of Anne.  Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst are wonderful as Matthew and Marilla.  Mr. Farnsworth really portrays the shy, backwards Matthew to a T.  And Ms. Dewhurst does an equally excellent job as Marilla, the stern, but loving disciplinarian.  Jonathan Crombie is great as Gilbert Blythe.  There seems to be a natural chemistry between him and Megan Follows that lights up the screen.  One can almost forget they are acting and actually believe they are Anne and Gilbert.I had recently just bought the DVD and watched it yesterday.  I must say that after watching this movie 15 years after I first watched it,that it really stands the test of time.  This movie is just as great as it was that first time (after I finally gave in and watched it :) )  This is entertainment for the family or for the romantic heart that wants to watch a feel good story!This is a movie to be treasured for years.",5,15 years later I still love it,1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,2160,"['Fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'month', '14th', 'birthday', 'got', 'chicken', 'pox', 'had', 'stay', 'home', 'school', 'week', 'when', 'first', 'seen', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'mom', 'told', 'movie', 'was', 'insisted', 'thought', 'was', 'stupid', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'had', 'eat', 'words', 'ever', 'finally', 'got', 'watch', 'watch', 'did', 'over', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'past', 'fifteen', 'years.Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'story', 'Anne', 'spelled', 'E', 'Shirley', 'orphan', 'girl', 'who', 'live', 'elderly', 'brother', 'sister', 'Matthew', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'there', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'been', 'mistake', 'Cuthberts', 'really', 'wanted', 'boy', 'not', 'girl', 'Marilla', 'Anne', 'trial', 'period', 'see', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'Matthew', 'love', 'Anne', 'way', 'home', 'train', 'station', 'keep', 'decide', 'keep', 'rest', 'movie', 'story', 'growing', 'up', 'bosom', 'friend', 'Diana', 'Barry', 'rival', 'school', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'life', 'Matthew', 'Marilla', 'PEI.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'absolutely', 'brillant', 'charming', 'spirited', 'really', 'brings', 'life', 'character', 'Anne', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Matthew', 'Marilla', 'Mr.', 'Farnsworth', 'really', 'shy', 'backwards', 'Matthew', 'T.', 'Ms.', 'Dewhurst', 'equally', 'excellent', 'job', 'Marilla', 'stern', 'loving', 'disciplinarian', 'Jonathan', 'Crombie', 'great', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'be', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'up', 'screen', 'One', 'can', 'almost', 'forget', 'are', 'acting', 'actually', 'believe', 'are', 'Anne', 'Gilbert.I', 'had', 'recently', 'just', 'bought', 'DVD', 'watched', 'yesterday', 'must', 'say', 'watching', 'movie', '15', 'years', 'first', 'watched', 'really', 'test', 'time', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'finally', 'gave', 'watched', 'entertainment', 'family', 'romantic', 'heart', 'watch', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'movie', 'be', 'treasured', 'years']",N/A

I remember watching the miniseries when it first aired on television, and I'm as much in love with it now as I was then.  Kevin Sullivan did a marvelous job of bringing this childhood classic to the screen.""Anne"" follows the story of orphan girl Anne Shirley --- a spunky, imaginative girl who wants more than anything to be adopted.  By an odd mistake, she lands in the care of Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, who wanted a boy.  When they finally decide to keep her, she becomes ""Anne of Green Gables"" --- having a real HOME for the first time in a very long time.The story follows her adventures --- and misadventures --- from breaking her school slate over Gilbert Blythe's head, to nearly drowning in the lake while playing the Lady of Shallot, to accidentally getting her best friend Diana Barry drunk.  Anne grows and matures, and the audience as well as the characters can't help but love her.The casting is brilliant.  Megan Follows is completely believable as Anne Shirley.  Colleen Dewhurst makes a perfect Marilla Cuthbert.  I adored Richard Farnsworth as Matthew, and cried when he passed away --- he took such good care of Anne and loved her with all of his heart.Spiced be a variety of colorful characters --- the gossipy Rachel Lynde, the handsome and smitten Gilbert Bltyhe, and ""bosom friend"" Diana Barry, the snob Josie Pye, and many others --- this movie is charming from start to finish.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll be anxious for more!  The movie is funny, romantic, and utterly delightful in every way.

Bernabo,"[405, 420]","I picked up the DVDs for the first two ""Anne of Green Gables"" series after seeing the musical version of the story in Charlottetown. I lucked out because the DVDs have been out less than a month. The actual film, of course, is worth 5 stars all by itself and is a classic adaptation of a beloved novel, so what I want to talk about is why Anne's fans should pick up the DVD version as well. There are cast bios, previews of the other ""Anne"" works by Sullivan films, and some production stills.However, the chief charms of the DVD version are the following: First, there is Megan Follows' audition for the part of Anne, which is fascinating to see her first attempts at nailing the character of Anne Shirley. You will notice considerably changes in her actual performance, but the raw talent is amply displayed. Second, there are missing scenes, most of which have to do with the wife of Reverend Allen. It seems the production was co-produced by a German company and so there was this extended subplot with Mrs. Allen, played by a German actress, that was fully integrated into the Germany version of ""Anne of Green Gables."" Third, there is Directors Commentary from Kevin Sullivan and the film's editor, although the latter is there mainly to given the director someone to talk to during the almost four hour film. The commentary is certainly fascinating, as we find out where certain scenes were short (mostly around Toronto, but some on Prince Edward Island), when scenes were shot (Megan would have to play Anne at 16 in the morning and 12 in the afternoon), as well as great stories about Colleen Dewhurst leaving a scene about to explode in laughter or adding a line.However, for all these fascinating tidbits about the production you will find yourself surprised from time to time that Kevin Sullivan often does not have a clue about the story of Anne and why it works. He expresses surprise, for example, that audiences find the scene where Anne thanks Matthew for the dress with puffed sleeves to be so emotional. Sheesh. She is looking at him with absolute love and devotion in her eyes and he says, ""Don't you like it."" Of course it gets to you. But not Sullivan apparently. Still, the commentary is first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it and using it to track down sites I intend to visit later this week in Toronto (I am going to find THE BRIDGE!). Finally, there are some behinds the scenes clips. Warning, this was a television news story on the production and is not the excellent behind the scenes documentary that aired on PBS. Obviously, my only complaint with this DVD is going to be the exclusion of that documentary, which, I supposed, belonged to PBS and not Sullivan productions. So, I know that most of you reading this not only already have ""Anne of Green Gables"" on videotape, you have had it for a long time. I am just here to tell you that picking up the DVD version as well is worth the additional expenditure.",5,"Why pick up the DVD version of ""Anne?""

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","Anne of Green Gables is a beloved children's book series, and the story of Lucy Maud Montgomery's feisty carrot-topped orphan is presented in a winning production by Canadian filmmaker Kevin Sullivan.When iconic books are turned into films the fans of the original books hold their breaths.  Faithful reproductions seem more common now with theThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)orPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996), for example, but in the early 80's there were few ""good"" examples and many bad ones.  (I still haven't seen a good film version ofThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnand the best version ofThe Count of Monte Cristo (Modern Library Classics)is the 1970s version with Richard Chamberlain -The Count of Monte - Cristo [ 1975, IMPORT , ALL REGIONS].Sullivan and company used brilliant casting and accurate, lush locations to give us an ""Anne"" that feels right.  Megan Follows beat out thousands of young actresses for the coveted part of Anne Shirley, and Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth were never better than here in the part of brother-sister surrogate parents Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert.This production swept the Gemini awards that year (Canadian Emmies) with 10 Awards including Best Dramatic Miniseries, Most Popular Program, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best Writing, Best Music, Costumes, Photography, and Production Design/Art Direction.  It also won the Emmy that year for Best Children's Program.The Awards barely give you the gist of the enormous outpouring of good will that accompanies a viewing of this program.  The character of Anne, although a downtrodden orphan, is nonetheless feisty and intelligent and determined to make her way in the world.  You can't help but pull for the girl, who begins the movie as slave labor to a hot-headed couple with ten children before being sent back to the orphanage after the husband suffers a heart attack.The elderly Cuthberts are looking to take in a young boy to help Mathew with work in the fields.  They are instead sent Anne, who charms her way into Mathew's heart in the buggy ride back to Green Gables.  The film hooks the viewer in this sequence and you can't help but want to know what happens next.Special kudos to Richard Farnsworth, who makes Mathew such an endearing and kind-spirited character that he received many marriage proposals in letters from adoring women despite being nearly seventy.There are few on-screen moments anywhere more heartwarming than the sequence where Farnsworth goes to the general store to buy Anne a dress with puffed sleeves, then the following scene where Anne tries on said dress.Anne of Green Gables was followed by an equally excellent sequel: Anne of Avonlea.

Montgomery...a book I loved as a child and still reread occasionally to this day. So often when people review a film version of a book they say ""it's not as good as the book, but..."" It's almost as if it is expected that the movie can't be as good as the book, because no one can out think a reader's imagination.As an avid reader and movie watcher, I've seen hundreds of book-to-movie adaptations, and this is the ONLY one where I honestly thought they got everything perfect. The casting was perfect (standouts include Megan Follows (of course) as Anne and Colleen Dewhurst as Marilla). The scenery was perfect. The faithfulness to the book was amazing and like nothing I've ever seen. The music was perfect, a hauntingly beautiful score by Hagood Hardy. You may think I need a thesaurus, but there's really no other word for it...perfect.One more piece of evidence for its perfection-now, when I reread the novel, I picture these actors in my head going through the story. You can't give a movie a higher complement than that. If, for some odd reason, you are a fan of the book and have not seen this movie, don't waste any more time. Go and buy it!",5,Perfect.

240879,A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1,6300277089,Melissa,"[0, 0]","This series has always been in my heart and always will be. I can always see myself in Anne Shirley, just as I'm sure every other young girl will. Kevin Sullivan did a beautiful job of bringing to life the works of Lucy M. Montgomery's series of Anne of Green Gables. I loved this movie the first time I saw it on television on PBS and I was thrilled to finally find it on DVD. Anne Shirley is a young orphan girl with a huge imagination, daydreams, and a huge talker. She's transferred from home to home and then back to the orphanage until she is finally picked to live in a town called Avonlea. She lives with a family Marilla &amp; Mathew Cuthbert (played by: Colleen Dewhurst &amp; Richard Farnsworth). After worrying she wouldn't be adopted because she's not a boy she warms their hearts and starts a new life with them. And she then soon meets her bosom friend Diana Barry (Schuyler Grant) and of course Gilbert Blythe (Jonathan Crombie). We follow the lives of these characters that Anne meets along the way. This series is for any young girl or for any girl at any age to enjoy and the entire family. The fun part is you can also see parts of the cast that end up being in Kevin Sullivan's production of Road to Avonlea. But this series is wonderful, charming, and full of adventures. The supporting cast is quite amazing as well they include: Rachel Lynde (Patricia Hamilton), Miss Stacy (Marilyn Lightstone), &amp; Aunt Josephine (Charmion King) just to name a few of my favorites. This movie is also about life and the human heart that we see through Anne's eye's. The DVD is full of tons of great stuff such as Megan Follow's audition, a small behind the scene's moments, missing scene's, &amp; tons more.

However, it took me a long time before I could be persuaded to watch it, because I assumed there just wouldn't be any masculine appeal here.  I was expecting a bland, innocent, goody-goody-two-shoes movie.  Well, I was right about it's being innocent, but far as it being bland, no it isn't.  It sure isn't ""Goody Goody Two Shoes"".  And while it may basically be a woman's movie, it definitely has masculine appeal.The filming in Canada is richly beautiful.  The characters here are each of them strong and believable, characters you will enjoy spending three or four hours with, not noticing the passing time.And this film is a breath of fresh air, without violence, sexual situations, or earthy language.  Usually, such a film is on the bland side because today's producers and directors don't seem to know how to handle drama without any of the above elements.  And if I am to be completely honest, I am not planning on dieting on cinematic fare such as this.  But it is nice to know that I can enjoy a pure family movie when it is done as this one is.I did wonder at the start about the narration, and whether or not I'd find it acceptable throughout the story, but truth is that the narration does add immeasurably to one's enjoyment.This one film that I can highly recommend to all except the most extremely jaded viewer.

She escapes the reality of her situation as an orphan in the 1890s by imagining she is a character in a novel or poem. She finds what she imagines about herself to be a lot more interesting than who she really is.Throughout her life she has always looked for a kindred spirit and has wished she could live on Prince Edward Island where the scenery is tranquil and inspiring.Spinster Marilla (Colleen Dewhurst) and her brother Matthew Cuthbert (Richard Farnsworth) are looking to adopt a boy to help on the farm and as fate would have it, Anne arrives on the train instead. Anne gains not only a family, she finds Diana and they become best friends.When Anne gives Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial, quite by accident, she gets into a heap of trouble and Diana and Anne are banned from seeing one another. Anne then realizes that true friends are always together in spirit.Anne is simply impetuous and at times you cannot help laughing even when what she is saying is quite serious. The first half of the movie is almost a comedy of sorts, while the last half is more serious in many ways.In the second movie, Anne's new teacher inspires her and teaches her to not only take her studies very seriously, but that she can also learn from her mistakes.""Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth, Anne. You see, it frightens them. So they put up walls to protect themselves from it. What we must bear in mind is that all these trials and tribulations that pop up in our lives, well, they serve a very useful purpose. They build character as long as we can hold onto the lessons we've learned from our mistakes. Remember, you can always start everything afresh tomorrow.""Anne pays more attention to her studies than boys and Gilbert Blythe does not exactly make a great first impression. Throughout the movie, Gilbert seeks only to talk to Anne and she doesn't realize that his attempts at teasing her are only the way he knows to get her attention. Gilbert and Anne both excel in their studies and seem destined to be competitors and not friends. Their relationship throughout the movie is very interesting, yet not quite a romance. Anne keeps running from how she really feels and Gilbert is rather patient with her.A movie that will captures your heart!Perfect for the entire family.~The Rebecca Review",5,Some dreams do come true...,1012348800,"01 30, 2002",2002,2397,"['Anne', 'Shirley', 'freckle-faced', 'red', 'headed', 'child', 'lost', 'beauty', 'day', 'reality', 'situation', 'orphan', '1890s', 'imagining', 'character', 'novel', 'poem', 'what', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'who', 'really', 'life', 'always', 'looked', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'wished', 'could', 'live', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'where', 'scenery', 'tranquil', 'inspiring.Spinster', 'Marilla', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'brother', 'Matthew', 'Cuthbert', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'are', 'looking', 'adopt', 'boy', 'help', 'farm', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'Anne', 'train', 'instead', 'Anne', 'gains', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'Diana', 'become', 'best', 'friends.When', 'Anne', 'Diana', 'currant', 'wine', 'instead', 'raspberry', 'cordial', 'quite', 'accident', 'heap', 'trouble', 'Diana', 'Anne', 'are', 'banned', 'seeing', 'one', 'Anne', 'then', 'true', 'friends', 'are', 'always', 'together', 'spirit.Anne', 'simply', 'impetuous', 'times', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'laughing', 'even', 'when', 'what', 'saying', 'quite', 'serious', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'almost', 'comedy', 'sorts', 'last', 'half', 'more', 'serious', 'many', 'ways.In', 'second', 'movie', 'Anne', 'new', 'teacher', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'studies', 'very', 'seriously', 'can', 'also', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'Sometimes', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'truth', 'Anne', 'see', 'put', 'up', 'walls', 'protect', 'What', 'must', 'bear', 'mind', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'pop', 'up', 'lives', 'well', 'serve', 'very', 'useful', 'purpose', 'build', 'character', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'hold', 'lessons', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'mistakes', 'Remember', 'can', 'always', 'start', 'everything', 'afresh', 'tomorrow', 'Anne', 'more', 'attention', 'studies', 'boys', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'not', 'exactly', 'make', 'great', 'first', 'impression', 'movie', 'Gilbert', 'only', 'talk', 'Anne', ""n't"", 'realize', 'attempts', 'teasing', 'are', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'attention', 'Gilbert', 'Anne', 'excel', 'studies', 'seem', 'destined', 'be', 'competitors', 'not', 'friends', 'relationship', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'yet', 'not', 'quite', 'romance', 'Anne', 'running', 'how', 'really', 'feels', 'Gilbert', 'rather', 'patient', 'her.A', 'movie', 'will', 'captures', 'heart', 'Perfect', 'entire', 'family.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

240905,A2FRAS05LEI6JJ,6300277089,Sadie,"[3, 3]","I remember watching the Anne of Green Gables series when it first showed on American TV, and fell in love with it.  I purchased the VHS versions of this and the sequal and watched them over and over with my mother and my young niece.  Three generations of women in my home enjoyed it trememdously.  About 10 years ago I donated the VHS tapes to the library assuming I had seen it enough, but then decided recently to purchase the DVD.  The quality is really no better than the quality of the VHS versions; however, you forget about it after the first few minutes.The story of Anne is actually very feminist in nature.  All the main characters are women, with the men being mere scenery.  Even the character of Matthew, with his quiet nature, takes second place to that of Marilla's overbearing, take charge personality.  Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth are perfect in their roles and play magnificantly off  Megan Follow's Anne.If you've seen Anne several times the commentary adds a new element to the story.  However, I would have liked more commentary on the actors and less on the lighting and scene design.  It lags in many places where the director didn't seem to have anything to say, although it did answer a lot of questions I had about some of the scenes, like the one where Anne is running through the fall trees -- I always thought it didn't fit because she never wore a bright blue dress with a white apron.  Now, I know the seasonal changes were shot the year prior to shooting the miniseries and edited in later.  Some of the commentary left out things I would have liked to have known, such as the scene where Anne finds a mouse in the pudding.  I want to know if they used a real mouse because it was so realistic looking, and if so, how did Megan react to having to scoop it out of the pudding.  Well, instead the director focused on the color of her sweater and the spoon vs. the color of the red wood in the kitchen!  He does express his utmost admiration for the actors in the series, especially that of Colleen Dewhurst (who is the reason I watch this over and over again).  I loved hearing what the director had to say about her personally and wished there were more of that type of commentary instead of how the lighting crew lite one scene after another to reflect the time of day or year.  Lighting, scenery and costuming are all important factors in any film, especially a period piece, and it's important to acknowledge it, but it appeared to hold center stage in the director's commentary on the making of the miniseries.  One thing I would like to note is that regardless of what another reviewer said, Kevin Sullivan does know Anne Shirley and all the other characters, and the story line very well.  He never makes the comment that he doesn't know why a scene worked well, only that the reason the scenes worked were because of the consumate acting ability of the actors involved in the scene.  Kevin Sullivan is the reason this miniseries was, and is, so successful.  It is Sullivan's vision that brought the story to the screen in such a manner that has made it literally a worldwide sensation.I had some trouble finding the commentary for the first part of the series.  The first 95 minutes is on one side of the disk with the remainder on the flip side.  Side B starts with a menu that gives the choice of languages and the director's commentary.  Side A does not.  After flipping through all the special features and not finding the commentary I finally selected the ""languages"" menu and found it in there.Whether you've seen this in the past or not, this is one series that is wholesome enough for the entire family and yet quite entertaining as well.",5,The Story is Timeless,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,3697,"['remember', 'watching', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'showed', 'American', 'TV', 'fell', 'love', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'versions', 'sequal', 'watched', 'over', 'mother', 'young', 'niece', 'Three', 'generations', 'women', 'home', 'enjoyed', 'trememdously', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'donated', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'library', 'assuming', 'had', 'seen', 'enough', 'then', 'decided', 'recently', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'quality', 'really', 'better', 'quality', 'VHS', 'versions', 'however', 'forget', 'first', 'few', 'minutes.The', 'story', 'Anne', 'actually', 'very', 'feminist', 'nature', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'women', 'men', 'being', 'mere', 'scenery', 'Even', 'character', 'Matthew', 'quiet', 'nature', 'second', 'place', 'Marilla', 'overbearing', 'take', 'charge', 'personality', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'play', 'magnificantly', 'Megan', 'Follow', 'Anne.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Anne', 'several', 'times', 'commentary', 'new', 'element', 'story', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'commentary', 'actors', 'less', 'lighting', 'scene', 'design', 'many', 'places', 'where', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'anything', 'say', 'did', 'answer', 'lot', 'questions', 'had', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'Anne', 'running', 'fall', 'trees', 'always', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'never', 'wore', 'bright', 'blue', 'dress', 'white', 'apron', 'Now', 'know', 'seasonal', 'changes', 'were', 'shot', 'year', 'prior', 'shooting', 'miniseries', 'edited', 'later', 'commentary', 'left', 'out', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Anne', 'mouse', 'pudding', 'want', 'know', 'used', 'real', 'mouse', 'was', 'so', 'realistic', 'looking', 'so', 'how', 'did', 'Megan', 'react', 'having', 'scoop', 'pudding', 'Well', 'instead', 'director', 'focused', 'color', 'sweater', 'spoon', 'color', 'red', 'wood', 'kitchen', 'express', 'utmost', 'admiration', 'actors', 'series', 'especially', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'who', 'reason', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'loved', 'hearing', 'what', 'director', 'had', 'say', 'personally', 'wished', 'were', 'more', 'type', 'commentary', 'instead', 'how', 'lighting', 'crew', 'lite', 'one', 'scene', 'reflect', 'time', 'day', 'year', 'Lighting', 'scenery', 'costuming', 'are', 'important', 'factors', 'film', 'especially', 'period', 'piece', 'important', 'acknowledge', 'appeared', 'hold', 'center', 'stage', 'director', 'commentary', 'making', 'miniseries', 'One', 'thing', 'would', 'like', 'note', 'regardless', 'what', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'know', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'other', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'well', 'never', 'comment', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'scene', 'worked', 'well', 'only', 'reason', 'scenes', 'worked', 'were', 'consumate', 'acting', 'ability', 'actors', 'involved', 'scene', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'reason', 'miniseries', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'Sullivan', 'vision', 'brought', 'story', 'screen', 'such', 'manner', 'made', 'literally', 'worldwide', 'sensation.I', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'commentary', 'first', 'part', 'series', 'first', '95', 'minutes', 'one', 'side', 'disk', 'remainder', 'flip', 'side', 'Side', 'B', 'menu', 'choice', 'languages', 'director', 'commentary', 'Side', 'A', 'not', 'flipping', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'finding', 'commentary', 'finally', 'selected', 'languages', 'menu', 'found', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'not', 'one', 'series', 'wholesome', 'enough', 'entire', 'family', 'yet', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Megan Follows captures the timeless appeal of  the orphaned Anne with spirit, grace, and wit.

Her performance, IMO, was cool, calm and collected and far too old for the character, especially in the beginning of the story. Her emotions seem too contrived, as does her entire performance, and self conscious; she has acting skills but they do not lend themselves to this particular role.Being 17 at the time was another handicap, as Anne is only eleven years old as  the story opens, and while precocious, she is also wondefully innocent, a charter trait totally missing in Follows' performance.

Now, it's on my list of favorite travel places to go. I couldn't wait for the sequel, 'Anne of Avonlea' to come out. I was hooked. I'll be reading all the Montgomery books. Just being trivial, did you know that there were others up for the part of the red-haired Anne Shirley? Even Schuyler Grant was up for the part of Anne but, got the part of Diana Barry (Anne's best friend) instead. Who is more perfect for the role than Megan Follows. I believe she captured the character more, as the red-haired, dramatic orphan Anne Shirley. Also rounding out a great cast is Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story, Texas Across the River, Resurrection) who plays Matthew Cuthbert and Colleen Dewhurst (Broadway's 'O'Niell's 'A Moon For the Misbegotten,' Annie Hall, Ice Castles) as Marilla Cuthbert.The story is about an orphan girl growing out of her humble beginning to a beautiful, sophicated young woman. Anne is taken from an orphanage by mistake as the Cuthberts look for help in their elderly years and try to get a boy from the orphanage. When the orphanage can't get a boy the Cuthberts want, they send Anne instead. So the story begins Matthew taking Anne home to the farm at Ingleside. When she mets Marilla the first time, Marilla is not much taken to Anne and tells Matthew she has to go back. But with much convincing from Matthew and Anne, Marilla let's her stay. Matthew and Marilla's lives are far from normal since the imaginative Anne who seems to manage to get into uninvited trouble. Out of the awkward young Anne grows a young lady's love for life and a penace for drama. I love films that are of this caliber aside from the kind of Hollywood stuff that peddles violence, sex, obscenity and profane language.

Before I get in depth on this particular movie, I'd like to comment on the series in general.First, all three installments are now available on dvd and, together, they total over 10 hours of pure television magic. I watched all 10 hours in one sitting. Admittedly, I have little self control anyway, but it's got to take something ABSOLUTELY AMAZING for me to keep the dvd player on for that many hours in a row. And this series, as a whole, is exactly that--absolutely amazing. The series was filmed over a period of years, and it's great to see the characters develop and grow older in front of your very eyes. Unlike a lot of Hollywood productions, where characters are recast if the actors who portray them do not wish to reprise their roles, each major character in this series is portrayed by one, and only one, actor or actress (with the exception of Fred, who was but a peripheral character in the second movie, but became a main character in the final installment). The result is a true attachment to the characters, and each successive installment makes you feel like you're revisiting with old friends. I highly recommend getting the set, although each installment is a complete story unto itself. As such, each installment can stand on its own if, for some reason or other, you can't get copies of the complete series.With regard to this particular movie, Anne of Green Gables is the first of Sullivan's three ""Anne"" movies and, in my opinion, the best. It's well written, beautifully filmed, and convincingly portrayed in both its direction and acting. I can't imagine anybody as Anne besides Megan Follows. The same is true for each of the other characters. This movie, based on a children's story by Lucy Maud Montgomery, is about an orphan struggling to fit into her environment, while at the same time retaining her sense of individuality and without compromising her innate sense of fairness and righteousnous. This is truly an inspiring movie--the kind you'd like your children to watch and hope they love. It brings you back to a nicer, gentler time where kids will be kids and where society is sometimes quirky and inappropriate, but where very little true ""evil"" is exposed. A return to innocence at a time when the world seems to lack it the most. I can't say enough good things about this film. Highly recommended...especially on dvd where you get a bunch of extras. ...Notwithstanding the bonuses on the dvd, however, this movie is worthwile in any format.

This movie has so much to offer just on its own, though, that it is easy to see why it has become a classic.First, I want to make clear, despite being over 3 hours long, you won't bored for a second. The beautiful scenery, the superb acting, and the masterful writing keep this movie going--you won't feel as if you have watched a 3 hour plus movie.Megan Follows stars as the orphan, Anne (spelt with an e) Shirley. She has had a lonely and tumultuous childhood--moving from one orphanage to the next, and one home to another (including the Hammonds--who are quite the type you wouldn't want as parents!), a twist of fate comes when Marilla (Colleen Dewhurst) and Matthew (Richard Farmsworth) Cuthbert, of Green Gables, Avonlea, accidentally adopt her. From there on, Anne's life--as well as every else's, in the provincial Avonlea--is changed.  But, however, I might add, Anne does get herself into plenty of trouble and she has Gilbert Blythe (Johnathan Crombie)--her rival, admirer, and academic equal--to deal with.I can't say enough about the acting. Every actor or actress does and excellent job portraying their role, and you will like even the characters who despise Anne.  Schyler Grant especially does a good job as Diana Barry, Anne's best friend and kindred spirit.This film is full of love and many messages but even if you ignore such phrases as &quot;better smart than pretty&quot; or &quot;tomorrow is fresh with no mistakes in it,&quot; you still have a great film.  There are so many moments, too, that are so touching and others that are so funny, that you may be disappointed--as I usually am--when the 3 hours plus have come to an end. One just never wants it to end, but that is why ANNE OF AVONLEA, the sequel to this, was made.I will add this--no matter how many times I have seen this--and I watch it quite often--it still seems fresh, funny, and inspiring. (An example is when PBS earlier this summer did basically a Anne-Anne-Anne weekends--even though I own the movies, I still watched it on PBS every weekend, from June to August, and that is quite a bit of Anne watching for anybody!) It is a rare movie that can succeed in not becoming old or passe, and this by far one of the very best of those kinds of rare movies.

240932,AN4AR3L5UQHDJ,6300277089,"William Bucko ""Bill Bucko""","[7, 7]","Kevin Sullivan's TV movie ""Anne Of Green Gables"" is as unusual in theme as it is beautiful.  On the surface, this 4-hour adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel deals largely with everyday events (everyday, at least, for Canada's rural Prince Edward Island, in the early 1900's).  But in terms of fundamentals it is a richly romantic story about values and their role in human life.Talented Megan Follows plays the feisty red-haired heroine to perfection.  Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst give unforgettable performances in their roles of Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, the elderly brother and sister who ask an orphanage to send them a boy to help on their farm, Green Gables.  Instead of a boy they are sent 13-year old Anne Shirley by mistake.Anne is bright, imaginative, and talkative, dreamily preoccupied with poetry and tales of romance.  But she is a passionate valuer, constantly searching for a ""kindred spirit"" or ""bosom friend"" to share her values with.  Passed from one foster family to another, with no one to care for her, she has known little happiness; but she loves life's promise with an aching intensity that makes her shine out in the midst of her bleak surroundings, and makes her seem ""odd"" to most people.  Marilla, a hard-headed ""realist"" who seems almost to have given up valuing, meets Anne's affection with nothing but crustiness, at first.  Matthew, on the other hand, is a painfully shy, quiet, gentle old man, who blossoms for the first time in his life under the warmth of Anne's love.  He is first to realize something it takes Marilla much longer to understand: that they needed Anne even more than Anne needed them.At the beginning of the story Anne is an impractical idealist with her head in the clouds, constantly coming into collision with her surroundings, falling from one misadventure into another.  With the best of intentions, she insults Marilla's friend, gets into trouble at school, is caught trespassing in a neighbor's cow pasture, and falls off a roof.  Marilla shakes her head: ""When I said you could stay as a trial, I had no idea you'd take me literally.""  Teased at school by a pesky boy who pulls her pigtails and calls her ""carrots,"" Anne breaks a slate over the boy's head.  In despair over her red hair, she tries to dye it and accidentally turns it green.  Finally Marilla begins to soften, as she recalls how her own fiery temper used to lead her into trouble as well.  Thoughtfully, she tells Anne that the girl may now stay with them permanently: ""I think you may be a kindred spirit, after all.""""Anne Of Green Gables"" does not have a complicated plot, but is full of colorful incident: Anne loses her best friend through a misunderstanding, attempts to act out Tennyson's ""Lady of Shallot"" in a leaky rowboat, lets a mouse get into the pudding, attends her first ball, and saves a baby's life.But her transformation from an impractical idealist to a romantic realist is what the movie is really all about.  This is a highly unusual theme, and it is dealt with better in the movie version than in the original novel.  One character, early in the movie, tells Anne she hopes that life will ""shatter this dream-world that you live in;"" and eventually Anne does change.  But unlike most people, whose youthful love of life is eroded and replaced by cynicism, Anne's values are merely transformed into practical goals, and she remains as much an idealist as ever.  (The transformation is not actually completed until the sequel, ""Anne of Avonlea,"" which is also noteworthy, though not as good as the first movie.)As an added bonus, ""Anne of Green Gables"" is beautifully filmed at historic sites on Prince Edward Island and elsewhere.  And Hagood Hardy's benevolent music score is rich in inspiration.  This masterpiece of romanticism deserves to live forever.",5,A PASSIONATE VALUER!,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,3835,"['Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'TV', 'movie', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'unusual', 'theme', 'beautiful', 'surface', '4-hour', 'adaptation', 'Lucy', 'Maud', 'Montgomery', 'classic', 'novel', 'deals', 'largely', 'everyday', 'events', 'everyday', 'least', 'Canada', 'rural', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'early', '1900', 'terms', 'fundamentals', 'richly', 'romantic', 'story', 'values', 'role', 'human', 'life.Talented', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'feisty', 'red-haired', 'heroine', 'perfection', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'give', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'roles', 'Matthew', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'elderly', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'orphanage', 'send', 'boy', 'help', 'farm', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Instead', 'boy', 'are', 'sent', '13-year', 'old', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'mistake.Anne', 'bright', 'imaginative', 'talkative', 'dreamily', 'preoccupied', 'poetry', 'tales', 'romance', 'passionate', 'valuer', 'constantly', 'searching', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'bosom', 'friend', 'share', 'values', 'Passed', 'one', 'foster', 'family', 'one', 'care', 'known', 'little', 'happiness', 'life', 'promise', 'aching', 'intensity', 'shine', 'out', 'midst', 'bleak', 'surroundings', 'seem', 'odd', 'most', 'people', 'Marilla', 'hard-headed', 'realist', 'who', 'almost', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'valuing', 'Anne', 'affection', 'nothing', 'crustiness', 'first', 'Matthew', 'other', 'hand', 'painfully', 'shy', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'warmth', 'Anne', 'love', 'first', 'realize', 'something', 'Marilla', 'much', 'longer', 'understand', 'needed', 'Anne', 'even', 'more', 'Anne', 'needed', 'them.At', 'beginning', 'story', 'Anne', 'impractical', 'idealist', 'head', 'clouds', 'constantly', 'coming', 'collision', 'surroundings', 'falling', 'one', 'misadventure', 'best', 'intentions', 'insults', 'Marilla', 'friend', 'trouble', 'school', 'caught', 'trespassing', 'neighbor', 'cow', 'pasture', 'off', 'roof', 'Marilla', 'head', 'When', 'said', 'could', 'stay', 'trial', 'had', 'idea', ""'d"", 'take', 'literally', 'Teased', 'school', 'pesky', 'boy', 'who', 'pigtails', 'carrots', 'Anne', 'slate', 'boy', 'head', 'despair', 'red', 'hair', 'dye', 'accidentally', 'green', 'Finally', 'Marilla', 'soften', 'how', 'own', 'fiery', 'temper', 'used', 'lead', 'trouble', 'as', 'well', 'Thoughtfully', 'girl', 'may', 'now', 'stay', 'permanently', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'not', 'have', 'complicated', 'plot', 'full', 'colorful', 'incident', 'Anne', 'best', 'friend', 'misunderstanding', 'attempts', 'act', 'out', 'Tennyson', 'Lady', 'Shallot', 'leaky', 'rowboat', 'mouse', 'get', 'pudding', 'first', 'ball', 'baby', 'life.But', 'transformation', 'impractical', 'idealist', 'romantic', 'realist', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'highly', 'unusual', 'theme', 'dealt', 'better', 'movie', 'version', 'original', 'novel', 'One', 'character', 'early', 'movie', 'tells', 'Anne', 'life', 'will', 'shatter', 'dream-world', 'live', 'eventually', 'Anne', 'change', 'most', 'people', 'youthful', 'love', 'life', 'eroded', 'replaced', 'cynicism', 'Anne', 'values', 'are', 'merely', 'transformed', 'practical', 'goals', 'as', 'much', 'idealist', 'ever', 'transformation', 'not', 'actually', 'completed', 'sequel', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'movie', 'added', 'bonus', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'historic', 'sites', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'elsewhere', 'Hagood', 'Hardy', 'benevolent', 'music', 'score', 'rich', 'inspiration', 'masterpiece', 'romanticism', 'deserves', 'live', 'forever']",N/A
