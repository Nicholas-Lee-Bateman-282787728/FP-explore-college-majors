1244575,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B001WAKFP2,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[0, 0]","The GREY GARDENS (HBO-MOVIE) is fantastic! I saw this on TV and had to get the original documentaryGrey Gardens / The Beales of Grey Gardens - Criterion Collection (2-disc set), which this is based on. Of course I had to buy the DVD of the HBO film as well.GREY GARDENS is the story of Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edie, who were aunt and cousin (respectively) to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. They were found living in a dilapidated mansion called ""Grey Gardens,"" in the posh and wealthy East Hampton, NY. The Maysles brothers, Albert and David, decided to make a documentary film about the Beales, which would become a cult hit, and I highly recommend that you see that (if you haven't already).The HBO film fills in the blanks by recreating scenes from the documentary and showing flashbacks of much better times for the two Beale women. It also shows what happened to Edie as she is pressured to move back to Grey Gardens and forced to give up her dream of being a dancer/actress and includes her affair with a married man. The film also shows how they eventually ran out of money, how the Maysles came to make their documentary, and the health department raid (that was mentioned in the original documentary).Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore give stellar performances. They aren't just acting, they literally become both Edith and Edie Beale. Especially Barrymore! She became ""Little Edie"" in mannerism and speech, and they both are dead ringers for the original. I'm sure Edie would have approved. I hope they both win Emmy awards (tie) because they really deserve it.======= SPECIAL FEATURES =========Grey Gardens: Then & Now--11:15-Minuteshort featurette comparing the HBO movie to the original documentary and features Jessica Lange, Drew Barrymore, Albert Maysles (original GG filmmaker), Michael Sucsy (HBO-director/writer) and others discussing the characters, sets, fashions and Edie's scarves.Even if this wasn't based on a true story, GREY GARDENS (HBO) is still an interesting movie to watch and I highly recommend it!",5,The **Back-Story** To Big & Little Edie Bouvier Beale!

1244576,A29RUNZT2H2GCU,B001WAKFP2,Ann Sherry,"[1, 1]","""Grey Gardens"" is based on the documentary of the same name that was done in the 70's. The Edie Beales (Big Edie and Little Edie) were aunt and cousin to Jaqueline Kennedy. Living on Long Island, they found themselves very poor after the father divorced Big Edie. With no money to really keep the house up and hard to meet daily living expenses, the two continued living in their home, called ""Grey Gardens"". As the ladies grew older, the more the Beales and the house fell into disrepair (raccoons and rats and slews of cats with fleas moved in through decaying holes)Their story is told by going from past (their glory days) to present, when their documentary was being filmed. It gives one a whole picture of what went on there and how these society ladies ended up in practical squalor.The two stars, Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore, stole the show. Jessica Lange played the well-bred aristocratic Mrs. Beale so well, both in her younger and her older days. Drew Barrymore was fabulous as Little Edie. I have seen in the media people making fun of her accent in this movie, but that is the way Little Edie talked. They even have her looking like Little Edie. When this movie is playing, I really have to look to see if it's this movie or if it's the documentary with the real Beales.I think one might appreciate this film more if they first see the original documentary. The two Edies can be kind of shocking, and one might think are unbelievable if just the movie is viewed. But they really were like this.

Writer/director Michael Sucsy has revived Little Edie, her mother Edith Bouvier Beale and their cat-ridden East Hampton home for the 2009 HBO television movie GREY GARDENS, which takes us beyond the documentary to explore possibly how and why these women transformed into the unique counter-culture icons captured on film in 1975 by the Maysles brothers.Shifting back and forth between the familiar scenes of the classic documentary and their past in the 1930s, 40s and 50s, we follow Edith (Jessica Lange), the colourful, bohemian wife of New York banker Phelan Beale (Ken Howard), and their free-spirited, namesake daughter ""Little"" Edie (Drew Barrymore), as their relationship is seared beyond that of the typical mother/daughter bond.  Wheras Edith willingly married for money and security, a loveless union with a husband who prefers an accommodating secretary in New York; Little Edie instead yearns for an independant world, perhaps as an actress on the stage or maybe even a dancer.  Just as she looks sure to get her big chance with producer Max Gordon, Phelan learns of Edie's affair with a married man and packs her off to her mother at Grey Gardens...Michael Sucsy took as his starting point the original ""Grey Gardens"", making careful note of the conversations where Edie and her mother argued and talked about the events which led/forced Edie back to the family bosom never to emerge, and crafted a drama which may or may not depict what really happened in the complicated relationship of the Beales. Sucsy was also granted access to the original diaries and correspondance belonging to Little Edie.  Whether or not it rings true in a historical sense hardly matters.  One important thing does: the Beales are alive again.Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore are absolute perfection as Edith and Little Edie respectfully.  They are so spookily accurate in the re-creations of the documentary, that I often found myself thinking I'd popped the 1975 DVD in by mistake!  No wonder Jessica Lange just recently walked away with an Emmy Award for her performance as Edith; she's spellbinding and really gives us a picture of how Edith must have carried herself in her 1930s heydey.True love and appreciation of the Beales was the main drive behind this movie.  The incredible, joyful, proud message of Little Edie lives on.  She's a heroine for the ages.Strongly recommended.TECHNICAL DETAILS:Widescreen 16:9 enhancedsoundtracks: English (5.1), Spanish (2.0)subtitles: English, French, Spanishclosed-captionedextra features: audio commentary with executive producers Michael Sucsy, Lucy Barzun Donnelly and Rachael Horovitz; ""Grey Gardens: Then & Now"" featuretteDisc format: DVD-9 (single-sided, dual-layer)",5,"""Well, mother and I are very entertaining, that's true...

The execution is almost perfect, the music, the photograph, it is very faithful to the 1975 documentary.  Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore delivered a brilliant performance. It's about the love story of two women, a mother and her daughter.  They loved each other very much, but their relationship was kind of disfunctional.  They decide to shut up the outside world.  ""Big Edie"" the mother lived in denial and gave everything for granted.  She educated her daughter the same way she was educated, ""Get marry and then you can do whatever you want.  If you don't, how are you going to take care of yourself?""  She was afraid about being alone, then she manipulates the circumstances and her daughter to avoid staying alone.Little Edie, resented the way her mother treated her.

1244589,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B001WAKFP2,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[15, 21]","In the original documentary we the viewer weren't really asked to do much other than laugh at these two poor souls who just couldn't cut it in society. Their homes were filled with trash and raccoons (and really, whose house wouldn't be be improved with a few raccoons?), they no sense of self, no sense of class, no sense of shame. They were sick, sick individuals who were so convinced of their own grandeur that at the mere sight of a camera they started to perform...which made them all the funnier. But now, starting with the Broadway musical and continuing into this film, we are beginning to be shown just how all this could have come to be. These are close relatives of Jackie Onassis after all. They had husbands and suitors and plans and money and a life... and then suddenly they were obliviously the butt of a national joke.The Beales here are played by Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange. Barrymore catches a lot of flack in my household for her acting skills (or lack there of). I've never really had any beef with her other than those ""Charlie's Angel's"" movies. And here, especially as the older Little Edie, she absolutely shines and disappears into the role. It is a role that is big and comedic but not necessarily easy to disappear into. The accent, the walk, the insecurity...they are all there and played to perfection. As the younger Little Edie she basically plays herself, which is fine and I was comfortable with it. Jessica Lange is also quite good but unfortunately saddled with the less exciting role. The film cuts from between the filming of the documentary in 1974-ish and their past lives when everything was grand and wonderful. And what a contrast! Talk about how the mighty have fallen. I might argue that slightly too much time was spent on back story, but it is that back story that adds texture and makes this the best incarnation of Grey Gardens yet (and yes that includes the musical which I found to be a let down). That said, scenes of them being rich and famous could have been cut and replaced with the real honey pot, that being their behavior after their fall.So how did it all end up like this? I think we can safely say money had a lot to do with it. Money created the luxurious world that they lived in early on, but then they were too scared to escape that memory, effectively leaving them marooned in their mansion. The way Big Edie controlled Little Edie also led to a co-dependency between them and prevented the evolution of Little Edie. She tried to run away but since her mother had no other hobby than trying to force her back to Grey Gardens she really had very little chance. Still, that relentless unwillingness to change, adapt or move on is exactly what makes them the stars that they are today. Things go from bad to worse, over and over again, and the poor Edie's are there trying to stop the flood. It would have been much easier to simply film a fictionalized account of the documentary...swoop in and have a laugh. But instead we are given a cold reminder as to why it is important to look outside yourself. Don't just accept what life throws your way and don't bury your head in the sand when things go South. I am far more on their side than the OCD clean freaks who surround me in life but that doesn't mean I didn't laugh my way through the documentaries. This film takes over as the crowning achievement in this series and is an experience that I highly recommend. ***3/4",4,From Comedy to Tragedy,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,3442,"['original', 'documentary', 'viewer', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'asked', 'do', 'much', 'other', 'laugh', 'two', 'poor', 'souls', 'who', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'cut', 'society', 'homes', 'were', 'filled', 'trash', 'raccoons', 'really', 'house', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'be', 'improved', 'few', 'raccoons', 'sense', 'self', 'sense', 'class', 'sense', 'shame', 'were', 'sick', 'sick', 'individuals', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'convinced', 'own', 'grandeur', 'mere', 'sight', 'camera', 'started', 'perform', 'made', 'funnier', 'now', 'starting', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'continuing', 'film', 'are', 'beginning', 'be', 'shown', 'just', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'are', 'close', 'relatives', 'Jackie', 'Onassis', 'had', 'husbands', 'suitors', 'plans', 'money', 'life', 'then', 'suddenly', 'were', 'obliviously', 'butt', 'national', 'joke.The', 'Beales', 'here', 'are', 'played', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Barrymore', 'lot', 'flack', 'household', 'acting', 'skills', 'lack', 'there', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'had', 'beef', 'other', 'Charlie', 'Angel', 'movies', 'here', 'especially', 'older', 'Little', 'Edie', 'absolutely', 'shines', 'role', 'role', 'big', 'comedic', 'not', 'necessarily', 'easy', 'disappear', 'accent', 'walk', 'insecurity', 'are', 'there', 'played', 'perfection', 'younger', 'Little', 'Edie', 'basically', 'fine', 'was', 'comfortable', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'saddled', 'less', 'exciting', 'role', 'film', 'cuts', 'filming', 'documentary', '1974-ish', 'past', 'lives', 'when', 'everything', 'was', 'grand', 'wonderful', 'what', 'contrast', 'Talk', 'how', 'mighty', 'have', 'fallen', 'might', 'argue', 'slightly', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'back', 'story', 'back', 'story', 'texture', 'best', 'incarnation', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'yet', 'yes', 'musical', 'found', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'said', 'scenes', 'being', 'rich', 'famous', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'replaced', 'real', 'honey', 'pot', 'being', 'behavior', 'fall.So', 'how', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'money', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'Money', 'created', 'luxurious', 'world', 'lived', 'early', 'then', 'were', 'too', 'scared', 'escape', 'memory', 'effectively', 'leaving', 'marooned', 'mansion', 'way', 'Big', 'Edie', 'controlled', 'Little', 'Edie', 'also', 'led', 'co-dependency', 'prevented', 'evolution', 'Little', 'Edie', 'tried', 'run', 'away', 'mother', 'had', 'other', 'hobby', 'trying', 'force', 'back', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'really', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'chance', 'Still', 'relentless', 'unwillingness', 'change', 'adapt', 'move', 'exactly', 'what', 'stars', 'are', 'today', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'over', 'again', 'poor', 'Edie', 'are', 'there', 'trying', 'stop', 'flood', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'easier', 'simply', 'film', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'documentary', 'swoop', 'have', 'laugh', 'instead', 'are', 'given', 'cold', 'reminder', 'why', 'important', 'look', 'outside', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'accept', 'what', 'life', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'bury', 'head', 'sand', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'South', 'am', 'far', 'more', 'side', 'OCD', 'clean', 'freaks', 'who', 'surround', 'life', ""n't"", 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'way', 'documentaries', 'film', 'over', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'series', 'experience', 'highly', 'recommend', '***3/4']",Grey Gardens

Young,"[1, 1]","I had some trouble deciding how many stars to give this movie, not because I didn't like it a lot, which I did, but because I couldn't help but wonder how much it can be appreciated as a stand alone work.  Having just seen the documentary for the first time last week, I have been fascinated by the lives of Big Edie and Little Edie, which not doubt increased my enjoyment of this movie.  The documentary painted a fascinating portrait of these two women as they were in their late 70's (Big Edie) and late 50's (Little Edie), and this HBO movie helps to complete that portrait by filling in the gaps and showing us how 2 once vibrant women became the eccentric - okay, cray - ladies that they are in the documentary.  After watching the documentary, I had thought that Big Edie was not so much crazy as selfish - she just didn't want to be left alone in that big old mansion - and that Little Edie was a victim of her mother's selfishness.  But after watching this movie, I realized that the relationship between these 2 is a lot more complex than I thought.  While Big Edie was selfish in some ways, there exists some kind of co-dependence between her and her daughter that can't be broken.  Little Edie is every bit as weak as Big Edie is strong and willfull, which is why one can't completely blame Big Edie for Little Edie's entrapment in that mansion.  Like Little Edie said toward the end of the movie, she could have left any time she wanted to, she just chose not to.So, for those of us who have seen the documentary, this is a very good movie enlivened by two superb performances from Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore.  For those who have not seen the documentary, however, I'm not sure how much they will be able to enjoy the movie, as it is kind of disjointed and does not really provide enough insight to the two central characters' lives.

1244606,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B001WAKFP2,James Hiller,"[10, 10]","Like many people, I was dubious, to say the least, at the idea of making a movie of the classic and unstoppable documentary ""Grey Gardens"". How could anyone add to the amazingly bizarre story of the Beales? As it turns out, this movie is almost a completion of the documentary, and it totally hinges on the Emmy worthy performances of Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore.Cult classic hit, ""Grey Gardens"" shows us the glamorous dilapidation of Big and Little Edie Beale as it was in the early 1970's, as filmed by the Maysles brothers. Each one worthy of their own screen time, together the women feed and react off each other in lovely hostility, so much that you can't help but watch, especially on heartbreaking close-ups of Edie's run ridden stockings. Throughout the documentary, the women opine upon the past; tell stories of men long past, names to us, perhaps familiar.What the HBO movie Grey Gardens does for us is bring to life these stories, and we learn more about these complex women that deepen and illuminate them.  Drew Barrymore plays Little Edie from the tender age of eighteen a socialite with life ahead of her, much like she was in the documentary, without the haggardness and avant garde style. Her Edie is dead on from the start of the movie; you see her ""staunch character"" from the onset. Jessica Lange's Big Edie sings, guides her daughter to her eventual ""reclusive"" life of Grey Gardens. Both of their characters arcs are predetermined, but watching these two amazing actresses pull this off stuns the viewer.A third character, both in the documentary as well as this film, is Grey Gardens herself; the famous run down mansion. Familiar from the documentary, with its sadly famous racoon eaten wall, the sets of the movie are painstakingly accurate and spooky in their own sense. The minute you see Grey Gardens in its heyday, back in the late 1930s,  your jaw literally drops at the elegance of the Long Island abode, which makes the older version oh so much more painful. The house ages unwell with the Beales, right before our eyes.What could have easily lapsed into camp, or mockery, Lange and Barrymore elevate the story to truth and honesty. Even in their reenactments of scenes from Grey Gardens, they maintain the honesty of the moment, such as the real Beales did. The complexity of performance demands more than just an HBO TV viewing, but should have been considered for the big screen (much like HBO's other amazing opus  )Whatever you may think of the Beales, Americans have a fascination with the rich and famous, and perhaps even more fascination with their downfall. I suspect the Beales would deny a downfall at all; more like a setback, a setback to their eventual career in movies, entertainment, or whatever. Little would they know that their fame would come much later after their passing. And the HBO movie Grey Gardens will become an indelible part of the legacy from here on out.",5,You've got to see it to believe it!,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,2927,"['many', 'people', 'was', 'dubious', 'say', 'least', 'idea', 'making', 'movie', 'classic', 'unstoppable', 'documentary', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'add', 'amazingly', 'bizarre', 'story', 'Beales', 'out', 'movie', 'almost', 'completion', 'documentary', 'totally', 'Emmy', 'worthy', 'performances', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Drew', 'Barrymore.Cult', 'classic', 'hit', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'glamorous', 'dilapidation', 'Big', 'Little', 'Edie', 'Beale', 'was', 'early', '1970', 'filmed', 'Maysles', 'brothers', 'one', 'worthy', 'own', 'screen', 'time', 'together', 'women', 'feed', 'react', 'off', 'other', 'lovely', 'hostility', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'especially', 'heartbreaking', 'close-ups', 'Edie', 'run', 'ridden', 'stockings', 'documentary', 'women', 'opine', 'past', 'tell', 'stories', 'men', 'long', 'past', 'names', 'perhaps', 'HBO', 'movie', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'bring', 'life', 'stories', 'learn', 'more', 'complex', 'women', 'deepen', 'illuminate', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Little', 'Edie', 'tender', 'age', 'eighteen', 'socialite', 'life', 'ahead', 'much', 'was', 'documentary', 'haggardness', 'avant', 'garde', 'style', 'Edie', 'dead', 'start', 'movie', 'see', 'staunch', 'character', 'onset', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Big', 'Edie', 'sings', 'daughter', 'eventual', 'reclusive', 'life', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'characters', 'arcs', 'are', 'predetermined', 'watching', 'two', 'amazing', 'actresses', 'pull', 'off', 'viewer.A', 'third', 'character', 'documentary', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'famous', 'run', 'down', 'mansion', 'Familiar', 'documentary', 'sadly', 'famous', 'racoon', 'eaten', 'wall', 'sets', 'movie', 'are', 'painstakingly', 'accurate', 'spooky', 'own', 'sense', 'minute', 'see', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'heyday', 'back', 'late', '1930s', 'jaw', 'literally', 'elegance', 'Long', 'Island', 'abode', 'older', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'painful', 'house', 'unwell', 'Beales', 'right', 'eyes.What', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'lapsed', 'camp', 'mockery', 'Lange', 'Barrymore', 'elevate', 'story', 'truth', 'honesty', 'Even', 'reenactments', 'scenes', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'maintain', 'honesty', 'moment', 'such', 'real', 'Beales', 'did', 'complexity', 'performance', 'demands', 'more', 'just', 'HBO', 'TV', 'viewing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'big', 'screen', 'much', 'HBO', 'other', 'amazing', 'opus', 'may', 'think', 'Beales', 'Americans', 'have', 'fascination', 'rich', 'famous', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'fascination', 'downfall', 'suspect', 'Beales', 'would', 'deny', 'downfall', 'more', 'setback', 'setback', 'eventual', 'career', 'movies', 'entertainment', 'Little', 'would', 'know', 'fame', 'would', 'come', 'much', 'later', 'passing', 'HBO', 'movie', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'will', 'become', 'indelible', 'part', 'legacy', 'here', 'out']",Grey Gardens

Edith Beale, the daughter, saw herself as a dancer, was insecure and given to enthusiastic demonstrations.  Over time, they fell into poverty living in squalor until the local authorities condemned their home.  What kept them from being a small story below the fold in the newspaper's third sections was their relationship to former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.  This made them news, the subject of a documentary and saved them.  Jackie provided for them financially until her aunt died.  At that point, the property sold and her cousin lived on the proceeds.HBO took this story and produced a powerful move portraying the two women for 40 years, starting in the 1930s.  Drew Barrymore as the daughter and Jessica Lange as her mother never hit a false note.  Lange starting as a flighty silly wife and mother, ages into an isolated lonely old woman with only cats and her daughter.  Barrymore starting as a debutant ages into a trapped woman, bitter with only dreams and exaggerations.  Both portrayals are brilliant; playing off each other, they construct a believable relationship that gradually leads nowhere.  This move depends on two people and they make it work!  Starting in 1936, we move back and forth through time, capturing the Beale's lives.  The editing is excellent and makes for a powerful story.  Major events are the only reference to what year it is.  This is in keeping with the story as very little changes at Gray Gardens.  The women age, the house needs more repairs but the life within is static.This is an enjoyable but not entirely comfortable film.

1244609,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B001WAKFP2,Jeff  Farrow,"[1, 1]","I watched the documentary version of GREY GARDENS a few months ago. My one & only said that I've ""just got"" to see it. I asked what it was about & she said it was a documentary about Jackie O's relatives who had fallen on hard times. It didn't sound very interesting to me at all & I said I'd pass; but Suzanne can be extremely persuasive, so I sat down for the inevitable hour and a half of boredom.For the first 15 minutes or so everything in the film seemed to confirm my worst forebodings. An old lady & her middle-aged daughter, living in a mansion that could pass for the House of Usher on a real good day. Then the girly-girly bit of exploring the ""feelings"" between the old lady & the daughter. Then something began to change. I became interested in the 2 women as people, as individuals. They reminded me of characters in a Chekhov play, unable to movtivate themselves to save their own skin. At any rate, I was glad I watched the documentary first, because it enhanced the movie, just as the movie filled in some gaps in the documentary.Jessica Lange is one of my all time favorite American actors. In the movie she plays a character much older then herself, and certainly less beautiful. There are a few flashback scenes in which she plays the ""Big Edie"" closer to her (Jessica's) own age. Drew Barrymore (who also co-produced) too is usually playing a character older than herself, but closer her age in the flashbacks. The flashbacks really help to make sense of how the characters came to find themselves in the odd predicament...well, that they find themselves in.For valid reasons or not, mother & daughter have exiled themselves to a life of isolation & poverty. And no genteel poverty here by any standard. The house is a filthy, decapitated heap of rotting wood, food & feces. A huge racoons lumbers in & out through equally gigantic holes in the wall that it's eaten through. The human occupants reaction? They feed it as though it was starving (it isn't.)Some of the reasons for their deplorable housekeeping are explored in the film version, verbally touched upon in the documentary. ""Big Edie"" is imperious & crashed up after a failed marriage (that has a lot to do with her finacial impoverishment.) ""Little Edie"" desperately wanted to be a performer, a film star. As a consequence in her real life she is acting all over the place. It is clear that she is an aging ""enfant terrible,"" a emotionally needed child prone to give utterance to uncomfortable truths that most people would rather not hear. Her need to perform comes out loud & clear in both versions--and you know what? She's pretty damn good.So what's up with the strange relationship between mother & daughter? They seemed trapped in a self-destructive, self-perpetuating, often vituperative, song & dance. The man who wrote the documentary review below, at one point states that he found Big Edie to be malicious & demeaning to those around her, particularly to Little Edie. I didn't get that sense at all, either in the film or the documentary. Instead I see them as 2 highly eccentric individuals who are as emotionally supporting as destructive. At any rate, they are individuals, people with distinct & strong preferences, dislikes & ideas--and that's what makes them so darn interesting.But there is something definitely ""wrong"" with them. They're not hoarders, a psychological obessive compulsive condition that causes suffers to  jam their living environment with everything they can haul back every useless thing they can finds--but the Beales don't go out. They just don't clean up after themselves--at all. They're not suffering from dementia because they're quite capable of carrying on prolonged, highly inteligent conversations. They seem locked in an unending bi-polar depression--with fleeting manic episodes when they try to connect with their failed ambitions to be on the stage.There's a great scene in the movie (not in the documentary) where Jackie O. actually shows up. You see, the local town council has threatened mother & daughter with eviction if they don't clean up their act--like the horrific condition of their house & grounds. Due to their Bouvier-Kennedy connection, the national media picks up the story & blasts it around the world. Jackie is one of a few relatives determined to help out (probably more out of shame than genuine concern.) Jackie is not favorably portrayed. She's a little snooty & reeks of class hypocrisy. As much as Aunt Edith sucks up to her, Cousin Edith puts her down (it's her belief that she could have married JFK instead of Jackie.) It's a very funny scene.The make-up & prosthetics used in the film are outstanding. This being said, it is the chracterization of the leading ladies that are ultimately impressive & make this odd little film a tremendous success. Drew Barrymore in particular shines in a role that almost appears to have been ""channelled."" Jesse Lange gave the same type of eerie performance in her depiction of the ill-fated actress Frances Farmer. Both actresses mesh as an ensemble, making this movie a wonderful & moving cinematic event.To top this off, one of the reasons that I was glad to have watched the movie after the documentary was the final scene. In the documentary you were pretty much left with the impression that Little Edie would never leave the house and would, in fact, die in it like mother before her. But this apparently that  was not so. She eventually does leave the house & encouraged by a few supportive friends, in the last scene she is performing in a nightclub--and the audience really seems to like her.I guess I've got girly-girly feelings too.PS. I should have left it there, but persistent interest in these strange people prompted me to explore their background. WIKIPEDIA carries 2 great articles on each woman. As it turned out, Little Edie's cabaret act went nowhere--although it did garner her some fans who kept in correspondence with. She died alone--as did her mother.Grey Gardens - Criterion CollectionFrances",5,Feelings Ain't So Bad,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,6018,"['watched', 'documentary', 'version', 'GREY', 'GARDENS',

I even heard that Drew Barrymore was scared to take the part of Little Edie because the character was so eccentric. However, Drew and Jessica Lange gave great performances.I watched the film with my sister two days ago and was both appalled and amazed at what I saw. How in the world could two women live in such filth yet retain such an air of dignity? Jeez, if I had cats peeing behind paintings laying on the floor, I would surely go crazy and lose my mind. There is no way I could live with mildew all over my bedroom walls or have stacks of rusty soup cans piled up in the corner. And not having running water or electricity? Whoa! Now of course if I lived in a 3rd world country where I was used to earning $100 a year, that would be alright. But not if I lived in an mansion on the Hamptons!I felt really sorry for Little Edie, especially as her mother took away her freedom. And when she lost all of her hair? Poor darling. But even so, the ladies found ways to entertain themselves with no money and very few friends.I thought Big Edie was a spendthrift who seemed deranged, but fun. Boy did she know how to throw a good party! Did you see her children drinking martinis and serving people drinks to guests during the house party scene? Seriously, their Mama was a party animal and piano lounge singer. Too bad her habits drove her into the poor house.Again, I'm so amazed that even though these women lived in unimaginable poverty, that they were able to make the best of it.

Hopefully the HBO release of this bio pic will inspire people to seek out the original piece that started it all. Thirty four years later the Beales have inspired a documentary, a Broadway play, and now this companion piece docu-drama.Grey Gardens, this film, is riveting. Starting with re-creating the fabled sprawling mess of the dilapidated mansion of the title, to re-creating a time when the Hamptons wasn't yet the high priced tony summer destination it is today (also see the bio-pick of Jackson Pollack starring Ed Harris to see what I mean - back then the Hamptons was frontier country,) to re-creating how the swells lived in Manhattan, this picture is artfully created. It moves through time and space over decades. The decline of the Beales contrasted with the changes in the Hamptons and Manhattan. It conjures the fact that both time and reality stopped completely for Edith and Edie.Unlike a documentary, this film creates the back story and dialog for Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore to bring to life. It's a shame they couldn't have cut that Emmy win in half to give both actresses their due. If forced, I'd have to give the edge to Jessica for capturing the flinty, manipulative, mean spirited stranglehold she used on her weaker, fragile daughter to keep her at her beck and call. She captures it with nuances - a narrowed eye, the grip of a telephone receiver, a change in inflection. It's an acting tour de force. You can't stop watching her. Hard to look at. Hard to look away. Like a car crash on the highway.Drew Barrymore is her equal. Four generations of Barrymore DNA can't explain how gifted she is as an actress. This film reminds me that she doesn't use the full extent of her talents on the lightweight material she's often chosen. Her Little Edie is tragic. She nails the loopy accent and cadence of her speech. She's got the mix of once upon a time ambition and resigned failure. Her neediness for attention, and delusions about her place in the world. Occasionally there is a glimpse that she does have a clue about what's happened to her life, and the reality of where she is now. It's truly sad.At the end, this is a bizarre tale of co-dependence, twisted love, and an awe inspiring survival instinct. What kind of defense mechanism can allow people to live as the Beales lived, to not acknowledge the filth, garbage, squalor they lived in, yet still behaving as if they lived in the patrician world order they were born into?There is no answer to that question. It's why I keep watching.

She ferociously holds on to her Grey Gardens home in the Hamptons, though both of her sons encourage her to sell and downsize her life.  The home ages with them, falling apart with overgrown vines, leaves, weeds, and raccoon and cat boarders.It is an unusual life, and seems a bit like an expose, but in the end you admire the women for hanging on to their home and their past.

Yes Edith Sr. certainly kept Little Edie at home to satisfy her own needs, including an obvious sense of abandonment by the world that she felt she was a part of.

1244620,AIFNOZKR9WTYI,B001WAKFP2,"mark twain ""25354""","[8, 28]","Last night, pumped up after WHIP IT, I watched the first half of Grey Gardens - the Drew Barrymore, Jessica Lange version.  From what I gather, the two are identical in regard to the basic hopelessness and extreme depressingness of the dysfunctional and thwarting relationship.  It's not ""cool"" to be into this kind of thing.  It's actually callous and self-serving.  The reality is, dysfunctional relationships are not fun.  The existence of the Beales was a long slow-moving misery.  If I want to see a crazy domineering elderly woman and her equally dysfunctional daughter bicker for hours on end, I'll visit my mother and sister.  My sister is, as a grown ""woman"" who is forty going on nine, living at home with my ageing and quite abusively senile mother.  They bicker incessantly, are both completely irrational and deeply unattractive.  Probably this sort of relationship and these sorts of psychologies are only interesting to people who have not lived around such things, grown up in truly sick families... Trust me, it's NOT FUN, nor funny, nor ""free-spirited.""  The Beales were not free spirits, they were chained spirits subsisting in the world of their broken psychologies for which there was no fixing.  My family is the same: broken and unfixable, deeply unattractive people.  Every time I've tried to intervene to instil some normalcy, or at least alleviate the filth of their living conditions, they've subjected me to irrational and spiteful abuse.  After trying to have my parents conserved (a legal process), I've given up on saving them from themselves.  So movies like this just make me sad.Update: Okay, for the sake of you people, I heroically burdened myself with the rest of this thing.  I was eating dinner while watching the movie, which I shoulda known was a big mistake.  One scene, featuring big and little Edie eating nameless black muck from a cardboard carton made me almost vomit.  The very idea that this sort of abject decrepitude can be anything like the tagline ""True glamor never fades"" enrages me.  Listen up people: this is a misrepresented HORROR MOVIE.  It is the true story of a disgustingly narcissistic woman and her completely un-nurturing relationship with her emotionally crippled daughter.  Any parent who would rather emotionally chain their child than see that child thrive as an individual is a sick piece of garbage and that is what big Edie was.  No glamor, no irreverent bon-vivant eccentricities, just a crazy cat lady and her emotionally chained daughter who descended by many gradual steps into an abyss of decrepitude.  On the plus side, the movie makes you want to do a million push ups, then clean the house for the rest of your life.  It makes you realize how worthwhile cleanliness and vigor are.  Saddest of all for me, the women in this movie are physically repulsive, devoid of sex appeal.  This may seem a shallow observation, but it isn't.Addendum 2.28.10: OPEN LETTER TO DREW BARRYMORE:Drew Barrymore, one can only hope that you, like all artists, pore over the reviews of your work.  And so I send this message in a bottle, yeah.Drew, what were you thinking?  You are clearly very talented.  Whip It is an inspired creation, one of the most dynamic and uplifting movies ever made.  So now I gotta ask you:  was Grey Gardens intended as an anti-Whip It?  Because that does seem to be the jist.  Having now seen the first part of the original documentary, it's clear to me that the HBO Grey Gardens offers a grimmer interpretation of the dynamics between little and big Edie than is present in the Maysle's film.  The plight of little Edie is more plaintive in the HBO version.  By the way, I think you captured little Edie very, very well.  But why?  Was the intent to produce a horror film and was it then mis-marketed by the suits at HBO as some slyly endearing snort of uplift?  I could see this happening.  The little Edie in the HBO production is a tragic figure, the general tone of the film bleak to the point of revulsion.  The contrast between Edie's youthful promise and her gradual dejected acceptance of her fate is crushing.  The scene where she returns home to find the house becoming disheveled, her face registering that she is deeply disturbed and revolted by what is happening... this makes her subsequent acceptance of her lot all the more harrowing and horrific.  It's all very well for her to say, ""I could have left at any time...""  In life and in relationships it's rarely so simple.  The chains that bind our hearts to those we love and who nevertheless hurt us seem to bind us more closely the more these parents let us down.  Little Edie, in your portrayal, yearns to somehow make it okay for her mother, to fix her mother somehow, as if this is her responsibility.  Goddammit it's all so twisted and yet so understandable.But, Drew, I gots to know.  Was it your intention to make an anti-Whip It, where the protagonist succumbs utterly to her mother's manipulations?  Please, tell me.  Give me some sign.  Defecate into an envelope and send it to the North Pole.  I NEED to know.ADDENDUM 3.6.10 THE DREAM POLICE THEY'RE COMING OUT OF MY HEAD.This morning I had a Drew Barrymore dream in which I was watching an episode of Fox Force Five, wherein a group of Five foxy chicks were sent out on crime fighting missions by their Charlie-esque boss and mentor, Johnny Fox - played by Samuel L. Jackson.  I seem to remember that Samuel L. Jackson's character was an invalid in a plastic bubble or something.  He had some kind of infirmity, which however did not inhibit him from wearing a lot of Kangol and coming on suave and debonair, in a menthol cigarette billboard Ladera Heights kind of way.  You Culver City residents, you know what I'm talking about.  But at any rate, each of the Foxes had her own special ability.  Drew Barrymore's character had the ability to start fires with her mind.  As I watched, the bad guy, he suddenly caught on fire and he was staggering around on fire, waving his arms in slow motion while he was on fire and while Drew Barrymore's character was staring at him fixedly with bulging eyes.  It was pretty engrossing.  I woke up refreshed, and with a TV treatment in my head.  I owe it all to Mirtazapine.  That dream movie was so good in fact, I'm gonna go ahead and bump Grey Gardens up one more star.",2,A MISREPRESENTED HORROR MOVIE,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,6329,"['Last', 'night', 'pumped', 'up',

Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[67, 67]","It is a rare thing to see a performance where a star is so immersed in a character that the star completely disappears and you are faced with a real living breathing character. This is pure magic when it happens. It happened with Vivien Leigh in ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" It happened with Elizabeth Taylor in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" And it happens in HBO'S stunningly good ""Grey Gardens"", not once but twice.The performances by Jessica Lang as Edith Bouvier Beal is a testament to her immense talent and a reminder of just how far she has come since she slipped from King Kong's fingers into our consciousness. This performance is one that should garner awards galore and be studied for years to come by aspiring actors. This is a masterwork by a great star.Then there is Miss Barrymore. Born of a towering and legendary acting family she has shown us in the past just how astonishingly good she can be. But listen boys, batten down the hatches for the approaching storm that will wrench your heart from your body like a tin roof off a barn in a hurricane.  As Edie Beal Drew Barrymore is a thrilling, revelatory, spectacle, a shear joy to behold and so utterly heartbreaking. This is the best work she has ever done and puts her beyond her ancestors as the greatest Barrymore in the dynasty.And buried in the midst of these two towering performances one must not neglect the brilliant, lovely and gentle work by Jeanne Tripplehorn as Jackie Kennedy. Her work here is wonderful. Miss Tripplehorn is indeed with her work on HBO's ""Big Love"" and here in this film fulfilling her youthful promise as an actress and coming into her own in her middle years.The thing of the matter is that these two wonderful actresses meld into the women in the story so convincingly that if you have seen the original documentary you will think you are seeing the real Beals.

I didn't know Drew had so much depth as an actress. She really should do more serious dramas. My only complaint is that the house looks much better and cleaner in this film when the documentary is being shot (I know that may seem hard to believe) than it actually was. Jackie had it cleaned up and panted but they destroyed it again. Even the beds they were filmed in were so nasty I couldn't believe it. Perhaps they didn't think people would believe how bad the house got again. But I've watched the documentary many times and I put it down to depression.

Of course, Big Edie and Little Edie were larger than life and the type of people who one would have thought were invented by some wildly imaginative writer.The movie recreates some scenes verbatim from the documentary, however the filmakers added on so much more that was nuanced and implied but never overtly addressed in the documentary.At the heart of the documentary was of course the mother and daughter relationship.

""bigtime reader""","[0, 0]","Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange both deserve an oscar for their efforts to bring the real life characters of Edith and ""little Edie"" Beale to life as authentically as they managed to do.The film fills in the gaps of their lives that the original 1970's documentary about these two eccentric mother and daughter (Aunt and cousion to Jackie Kennedy) doesn't touch on.We learn that Little Edie wanted to become a dancer and actress and gave up way to easily on her dreams due to a sad setback with a married man (in the movie Edie returns to Grey Gardens after what seems like a brief stay in New York City. In reality she returned to her Mother's mansion when she was 35 years old and after a few years away).Edith was once a wealthy married woman, who liked to entertain people at her fancy mansion (located in the Hamptons) with parties and songs and a fancy for the piano teacher. All of that ended when Edith divorced and Little Edie joined her back at Grey Gardens, a mansion in desperate need of care, but neither woman had any kind of employment and living on a modest pension and over the years they supported their meager lifestyle by selling their valuables.Over time the Mansion became a run down nightmare, with cats and racoons claiming much of the property and nature intruding in a most unpleasant way. Mother and daughter basically were reduced to ""living"" in one of the bedrooms as the rest of the Mansion was in total squalor. Eventually they didn't even have running water or electricity.After photos were taken of the women, showing them surrounded by garbage and filth in the decaying Mansion, and stories appeared in newspapers about their horrible circumstance, Jackie Kenndy had the mansion somewhat cleaned and restored. Shortly after this a documentray was filmed about the two dysfunctional women that achieved cult status.Of course Edith could have sold the Mansion long ago and relocated with her daughter to a better Life, but she doggedly hung unto the Mansion for all she was worth even though she basically lived much of her later life confined to a room. All of this resulted in the two women existing together in this place, feeding on memories from a life long gone and possibilities long past and still holding on that one day their chance will somehow arrive.It is pretty obvious that Little Edie suffered from some sort of mental Illness, and even though she periodically blamed her Mother for stealing her life, it is clear that Little Edie most likely would not have functioned properly on her own in the world.The film shows all of this and more...including Little Edie's bitterness over a wasted Life and anger toward her Mother and Edith smothering protection and dependency on her Daughter but also a kind of unbreakable bond and love between these two women that breaks your heart.",5,ASTOUNDING !,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,2826,"['Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'deserve', 'oscar', 'efforts', 'bring', 'real', 'life', 'characters', 'Edith', 'little', 'Edie', 'Beale', 'life', 'as', 'authentically', 'managed', 'do.The', 'film', 'fills', 'gaps', 'lives', 'original', '1970', 'documentary', 'two', 'eccentric', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Aunt', 'cousion', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', ""n't"", 'touch', 'on.We', 'learn', 'Little', 'Edie', 'wanted', 'become', 'dancer', 'actress', 'gave', 'up', 'way', 'easily', 'dreams', 'due', 'sad', 'setback', 'married', 'man', 'movie', 'Edie', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'what', 'brief', 'stay', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'reality', 'returned', 'Mother', 'mansion', 'when', 'was', '35', 'years', 'old', 'few', 'years', 'away', '.Edith', 'was', 'once', 'wealthy', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'liked', 'entertain', 'people', 'fancy', 'mansion', 'located', 'Hamptons', 'parties', 'songs', 'fancy', 'piano', 'teacher', 'ended', 'when', 'Edith', 'divorced', 'Little', 'Edie', 'joined', 'back', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'mansion', 'desperate', 'need', 'care', 'woman', 'had', 'kind', 'employment', 'living', 'modest', 'pension', 'years', 'supported', 'meager', 'lifestyle', 'selling', 'valuables.Over', 'time', 'Mansion', 'became', 'run', 'down', 'nightmare', 'cats', 'racoons', 'claiming', 'much', 'property', 'nature', 'intruding', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'way', 'Mother', 'daughter', 'basically', 'were', 'reduced', 'living', 'one', 'bedrooms', 'rest', 'Mansion', 'was', 'total', 'squalor', 'Eventually', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'running', 'water', 'electricity.After', 'photos', 'were', 'taken', 'women', 'showing', 'surrounded', 'garbage', 'filth', 'decaying', 'Mansion', 'stories', 'appeared', 'newspapers', 'horrible', 'circumstance', 'Jackie', 'Kenndy', 'had', 'mansion', 'somewhat', 'cleaned', 'restored', 'Shortly', 'documentray', 'was', 'filmed', 'two', 'dysfunctional', 'women', 'achieved', 'cult', 'status.Of', 'course', 'Edith', 'could', 'have', 'sold', 'Mansion', 'long', 'ago', 'relocated', 'daughter', 'better', 'Life', 'doggedly', 'hung', 'Mansion', 'was', 'worth', 'even', 'basically', 'lived', 'much', 'later', 'life', 'confined', 'room', 'resulted', 'two', 'women', 'existing', 'together', 'place', 'feeding', 'memories', 'life', 'long', 'gone', 'possibilities', 'long', 'past', 'still', 'holding', 'one', 'day', 'chance', 'will', 'somehow', 'arrive.It', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Little', 'Edie', 'suffered', 'sort', 'mental', 'Illness', 'even', 'periodically', 'blamed', 'Mother', 'stealing', 'life', 'clear', 'Little', 'Edie', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'functioned', 'properly', 'own', 'world.The', 'film', 'more', 'including', 'Little', 'Edie', 'bitterness', 'wasted', 'Life', 'anger', 'Mother', 'Edith', 'smothering', 'protection', 'dependency', 'Daughter', 'also', 'kind', 'unbreakable', 'bond', 'love', 'two', 'women', 'heart']",Grey Gardens

Their story is one of 'riches to rags,' chronicling their decline as their star-studded dreams and, once lavish lifestyles, become little more than fantasies, following 'Big Edie's' divorce and ensuing loss of social status and fortune.While appearing somewhat oblivious, or perhaps in denial, of their situation, their East Hampton Estate is transformed into a refuge for cats, raccoons and vermin, not to mention feces and trash.  Their caviar becomes cat food. They develop a self-isolating, hermit-like lifestyle, filling in the moments with bickering, depreciating comments and a dose of rivalry and grandiosity.Within this backdrop, the dysfunction driving this mother, daughter relationship is vividly portrayed---and clearly one of love and hate. 'Big Edie' is a bitter, controlling, and passive dependent mother, who makes sure she keeps 'Little Edie' close to her side by feeding her frailties.  This, at times, is hard to watch, appearing almost too voyeuristic, as these ladies spiral into an unreal world---one I feel was much more than just eccentric.  I personally feel it became a shared madness.  My heart ached for 'Little Edie.'And, I'm just getting to the actors, now.  You might wonder why, since I'm reviewing a movie---not a book, or the documentary.  What about the actors, you say?  Well, I think this is because Jessica Lange, as 'Big Edie' and Drew Barrymore, as 'Little Edie' brought their characters so to life, that I frequently forgot during the film that I was watching actors.  I felt I was stealthily watching the real characters through a dingy window of the Estate. Their simple moments of joy became mine, as well as their pain.  This is the first time I have ever become so enmeshed with characters that I completely forgot the actors portraying them, until it was over, and I could reflect upon the splendid job they had done.  This is a testament to the quality of this movie---not only the acting, and costumes, but the setting.  Yes, the setting was so well done you could almost smell the cat urine.I'm recommending this movie to all of my friends.  I suspect that women will enjoy it more, as my husband left about a third of the way through declaring it a 'chick movie.'  But, I think anyone interested in the psychology of dysfunctional, relational dynamics, will be mesmerized. I know I'm placing the Documentary on my Wish List.

Believe me, there must be an acting gene because this performance as Little Edie Bouvier Beale is perhaps her finest to date. Jessica Lange is brilliantly casted as Big Edie Bouvier Beale. Big Edie is Jackie Onassis's maternal aunt and Little Edie is her maternal cousin. Jeanne Tripplehorn plays adult Jackie when she comes to visit them at their Grey Gardens estate in decay.Anyway, Big Edie was right. People would pay to see them. There is something about Little Edie wearing shirts wrapped around her head to cover her baldness or alpacia (whatever it's called). The Sayles brothers come to do a documentary regarding the Kennedys but they return because of the mother and daughter at Grey Gardens.The story goes that Grey Gardens was in terrible shape in the 1970s and Jackie's relatives would have been evicted since it wasn't fit for human or animal habitation. They had the habit of collecting cats and raccoons as pets. Big Edie loves Grey Gardens, her home, and can't imagine leaving it unless she's dead.In the flashbacks, we see the two Edies in their younger days before Big Edie's divorce from Phelan Beale. They had two younger sons, Phelan II, and Bouvier better known as Buddy. When little Edie returns home from New York City after her disappointments there, she returns to become caretaker to her outspoken, opinionated mother. Suddenly they shut themselves off from the outside world. They still bicker and feud like a married couple and even sleep in the same bedroom of the sprawling estate.Still we want more about the two Ediths. There have been a few documentaries and even inspired a Broadway musical which played in London's West End as well. The story of the mother and daughter can relate to all of us in some way.I wished the film showed more on the DVD. We see a little of the behind the scenes and a comparison of the original documentary which became a cult hit and made little Edie Beale a star of her own even for just a little while.

Its makers didn't lead its flamboyant and willing participants, they simply allowed them to reveal themselves to us as they wished. Even if you find the endeavor exploited the Beales just by showing the squalid conditions in which they reside, or if you feel that big and little Edie are clueless as to how odd or tragic their lives seem, the original Grey Gardens draws no conclusions and makes no judgment. It just ""is"" and that's its strength. Though both women have their regrets, neither seem as torn up about their decline as we are to behold its severity. They even seem to thrive.So why make a drama that tries to suppose what happened to Edie & Edie? You got me. The film tries to read subtext into the women's actual quotes and tie them to a largely fabricated past, giving a presumed dramatic narrative to their decline.  The result is a film that never stands on its own feet, and tries to impose conventional motivations on two very unconventional women. The original documentary never sought to wrap things up in a neat little package, unfortunately this dramatization of life does nothing but.",2,Dumbing it down a shade,1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,1167,"['original', 'documentary', 'GREY', 'GARDENS', 'was', 'landmark', 'film', 'makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'lead', 'flamboyant', 'willing', 'participants', 'simply', 'allowed', 'reveal', 'wished', 'Even', 'find', 'endeavor', 'exploited', 'Beales', 'just', 'showing', 'squalid', 'conditions', 'reside', 'feel', 'big', 'little', 'Edie', 'are', 'clueless', 'how', 'odd', 'tragic', 'lives', 'seem', 'original', 'Grey', 'Gardens', 'conclusions', 'judgment', 'just', 'strength', 'women', 'have', 'regrets', 'seem', 'torn', 'decline', 'are', 'behold', 'severity', 'even', 'seem', 'thrive.So', 'why', 'make', 'drama', 'suppose', 'what', 'happened', 'Edie', 'Edie', 'got', 'film', 'tries', 'read', 'subtext', 'women', 'actual', 'quotes', 'tie', 'largely', 'fabricated', 'past', 'giving', 'presumed', 'dramatic', 'narrative', 'decline', 'result', 'film', 'never', 'own', 'feet', 'tries', 'impose', 'conventional', 'motivations', 'two', 'very', 'unconventional', 'women', 'original', 'documentary', 'never', 'sought', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'package', 'unfortunately', 'dramatization', 'life', 'nothing']",Grey Gardens
