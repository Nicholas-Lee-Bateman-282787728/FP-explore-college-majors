Desi is a five-year-old girl who has become inconsolable after the death of her father. Desi's mother, Rhonda, isn't sure what to do for her troubled daughter and when the girl tells her mother she wants to write her father a last letter and attach it to a balloon so it will be carried to heaven, Rhonda agrees it's a good idea. Desi and Rhonda send out the balloon, which is carried by the winds to a small community known as Mermaid. There, a man named Wade MacKinnon finds the balloon, with the letter attached. After reading the message, Wade and his family decide to answer the letter, as if their missive had been written by Desi's late father.This is such  a beautiful  and moving  story  and indeed it will bring you to tears!",5,Beautiful!!!!!!!,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,851,"['child', 'letter', 'heaven', 'unexpected', 'response', 'touching', 'family', 'drama', 'inspired', 'actual', 'incidents', 'Desi', 'five-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'become', 'inconsolable', 'death', 'father', 'Desi', 'mother', 'Rhonda', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'troubled', 'daughter', 'when', 'girl', 'mother', 'write', 'father', 'last', 'letter', 'attach', 'balloon', 'will', 'be', 'carried', 'heaven', 'Rhonda', 'good', 'idea', 'Desi', 'Rhonda', 'send', 'out', 'balloon', 'carried', 'winds', 'small', 'community', 'known', 'Mermaid', 'man', 'named', 'Wade', 'MacKinnon', 'balloon', 'letter', 'attached', 'reading', 'message', 'Wade', 'family', 'decide', 'answer', 'letter', 'missive', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'Desi', 'late', 'father.This', 'such', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'story', 'indeed', 'will', 'bring', 'tears']",Mermaid

If you like action, explosions, car chases, etc., this is NOT the movie for you.The death of her father has put a 5-year-old girl into such shock that she refers to herself in the third person.  She believes her father doesn't come home because she has done something bad and he won't forgive her.  (The portrayal of this child by the child actress is nothing short of amazing.)  How she is cured and the kindness shown to her, not just by those around her and by a distant family, but by the public at large is one of the most moving sequences on film.

580537,A20TD5PADOEGFE,B00005B6L7,Elyse Wheeler,"[0, 0]","I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Mermaid was really clean and based on a true story. There was a few utterances of mild crude language and the story is about a child not understanding that her father has died.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a four star and approved it for all ages.I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  A family member recommended it and then I just had to buy the DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.I loved all the characters, especially the little girl, Desi.  Through the whole show she refers to herself in the third person because she is trying to put herself out of her pain and fear after her father's death.  Even thinking that he left her because she was naughty.  Her family has a difficult time trying to tell her that her father is gone and not coming back and both Desi and her mom have a hard time letting go and moving on.  The fact that when Desi sends a letter to her dad, attached to a Mermaid balloon, and that it makes it 4,000 miles to Mermaid, Canada where a kind family answers the letter is very touching.  Saying that since her dad knew he couldn't answer it himself, he sent it to someone who would do it for him to remind Desi that her dad didn't forget about her.  Desi and her Mom then travel to Mermaid, Canada to visit the kind family who helped them to find peace and happiness again.  At the end of the movie the real Desi and her family are seen on the film location and discuss the making of the movie.Overall, I loved this movie and will watch it again and again.",5,Mermaid - Will watch it again,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,1783,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Mermaid', 'was', 'really', 'clean', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'few', 'utterances', 'mild', 'crude', 'language', 'story', 'child', 'not', 'understanding', 'father', 'died', 'not', 'rated', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'gave', 'four', 'star', 'approved', 'ages.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again', 'family', 'member', 'recommended', 'then', 'just', 'had', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', 'loved', 'characters', 'especially', 'little', 'girl', 'Desi', 'whole', 'show', 'herself', 'third', 'person', 'trying', 'put', 'pain', 'fear', 'father', 'death', 'Even', 'thinking', 'left', 'was', 'naughty', 'family', 'difficult', 'time', 'trying', 'tell', 'father', 'gone', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'Desi', 'mom', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'letting', 'go', 'moving', 'fact', 'when', 'Desi', 'letter', 'dad', 'attached', 'Mermaid', 'balloon', '4,000', 'miles', 'Mermaid', 'Canada', 'where', 'kind', 'family', 'letter', 'very', 'touching', 'Saying', 'dad', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'answer', 'sent', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'remind', 'Desi', 'dad', 'did', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Desi', 'Mom', 'then', 'Mermaid', 'Canada', 'visit', 'kind', 'family', 'who', 'helped', 'find', 'peace', 'happiness', 'again', 'end', 'movie', 'real', 'Desi', 'family', 'are', 'seen', 'film', 'location', 'discuss', 'making', 'movie.Overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",Mermaid

This definately is another success.It's a simple story about a Rhonda and her daughter who loses her husband and they both hold in their grief so deeply they become emotionally paralyzed. Rhonda's mother (Ellen Burstyn) comes up with the idea to send a letter to the little girl Desi's dad up in Heaven tied to a mermaid balloon which mysteriously ends up thousands of miles away in a town called Mermaid in Canada. This incredible event changes Desi and Rhonda's life forever.Now mind you I am not a person who is prone to crying at movies but this one touched me so deeply I couldn't help myself. I never expected to be so profoundly moved by this little film, but it was just so beautiful and heartfelt. The fact that this is based on a true story only adds to it's impact.

580541,A1UGBHFRUDNYD1,B00005B6L7,"Nenah Sylver ""Nenah Sylver, PhD, author""","[4, 10]","This film is based on a true story. Grieving Desi (Jodelle Ferland) is not coping well with the death of her dad. Emotionally dissociated (she refers to herself in the third person), she asks incessant questions: where is her father, and when can she talk to him. Desi's mom Rhonda (Samantha Mathis), losing the house she had built with her now-deceased husband, takes the little girl and moves in with her mother Trish (Ellen Burstyn). Rhonda remains stoic, despite Trish's attempts to get her to cry, and act on her romantic interest in a man (David Kaye) who likes her too. Both Grandma and Mom are worried about Desi, who has become so self-destructive, she locks herself in the bathroom and slashes off some hair, and wanders in a field at night dangerously near a thresher.As Desi continues to be unmanageable and slips into a fantasy world, Rhonda has her send her father a letter, propelled skyward tied to a helium-filled balloon. In several days, the message reaches Prince Edward Island from California. The Canadian family who finds the letter writes back. They also send Desi a gift for her fifth birthday, explaining that since there are no stores in heaven, her father asked them to send the gift for him. After receiving the package from Canada, Desi's wounds are magically healed and she no longer refers to herself in the third person. After the extraordinary tale makes it into the newspapers, readers spontaneously send the destitute family money for airfare, Rhonda takes Desi to Canada to visit the family, and everyone relaxes and is happy again.What might have been a really good film fails in almost all areas. Most of the acting is wooden. While visually cute, Desi speaks her many lines with no discernible emotion, soul or substance, and with an incessantly high-pitched, whiny voice that tires the ear. Samantha Mathis, who was excellent in A Stranger's Heart, plays Rhonda with an inscrutable face and you never quite get a sense of what she's really going through. The only good acting is from Ellen Burstyn, whose character has great believability and depth, and David Kaye, who manages to convey a lot without saying much. But even their acting cannot save this poorly written movie. The family's problems are tortuously dragged out: Desi's mentally ill antics, which dominate over an hour of the 90-minute film, should have been whittled down to 25 minutes.One coy plot manipulation is especially over the top: Blu Mankuma, a very good actor, is placed in various roles (graveyard attendant, ice cream man, balloon seller, postman), apparently to convey the idea that an ""angel"" is present. But there's no need for such contrivance. The true story would have carried this movie very nicely, in its own right--if only the writer and director hadn't piled on the schmaltz.The best part of the film is the end, when we see the real California and Canadian families. (Unfortunately, one must strain to see their faces through the credits.) Desi is now a teenager, shown interacting with Jodelle--who, when she spontaneously talks, appears much more intelligent and vital than the character she portrayed. The real mother and grandmother project enormous presence and heart, and the Canadian couple likewise project great heart. It's really too bad that no documentary was made of these families; it would have been infinitely more interesting than the film itself. Showing the real families brought this 2 star movie up to 3 stars.Why does Hollywood feel that it must embellish what can stand on its own merits? From other sites, it appears that Rhonda and her ex-husband had been divorced, and that he had then committed suicide.
