574479,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000059TEQ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 5]","This film is sad.This film is arrogant.This film is simple.This film is edited poorly.This film means never having to say you're sorry.These are just a few random thoughts conjured up while recently watching the 1970s blockbuster hit, ""Love Story"".  It is the summer of blockbusters, and while $10 or more is a bit like paying for gas at the local Cineplex, this critic decided to watch old blockbusters in the comfort of his cool, quiet, and subdued home.  Having read the book many years ago, I was eager to see how exactly it would translate onto the bigger screen.  There was little action, little conflict, and even a smaller plot - it was, simply put, a ""love story"".  Two Ivy-leaguers meet, they argue with their parents, they marry, and suddenly tragedy strikes.  It is simple, like love - and it does translate well onto the screen with our two leads being Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw.  Together their chemistry is shattering, bring to life a small piece of Americana, and the depth of life.  As Jennifer and Oliver pour their literal hearts out on screen, the issues of ""Love Story"", while not many, do break free and run rampant throughout.  The lacking development, the clutter of language, the electric music, and the cheapened edits all culminate as utter distracts to this film.  These errors pull from the story, creating a mediocre tale that could have been the greatest love story ever sold.Let me begin by saying that as much criticism as I give ""Love Story"", it still (and probably will with another viewing) brought a tear to my eye.  It is ultimately a story about the power of love, and even if you can see through the clich&eacute; language, parts of this film will remind you of a love you have or once had.  It has sentimental value that presses on the right heartstrings at the right time.  We can thank, and denounce at the same time, writer Erich Segal for this.  His story takes us to love, but his words violently pull us away.  Throughout this film, one cannot help but wonder if O'Neal and MacGraw read their lines off cue-cards behind them, or if the words coming from their mouths were to be staples of clich&eacute; for decades of romantic films to follow.  In one corner we have a witty, independent woman who is not afraid to speak her mind, in the other corner, we have a guy who takes direction well - OK - I get that, but what else is there about these characters that we could learn about.  If this is to be a talking film, let the words they speak to each other express their emotion stronger - or at least develop a subplot around them that allows the viewer to see all the dimensions of both Oliver and Jennifer.  I knew their connections, but I finished this film without really knowing them.  From the book, one could hear their inner-voice, without that in the film, we were lead on a one-sided voyage through love without any potholes or pitfalls.  Each and every time a conflict occurred, simple words were spoken, we were taken to a new city, and we began our story all over again.  With conflict comes resolution, and one cannot resolve with just one phrase - ""Love means not having to say your sorry"".Clarification.  The simplicity of this story is what kept me glued to the screen the entire hour and a half.  The acting force behind O'Neal and MacGraw was consistent throughout, providing me with excited moments, emotional moments, and a heavy cardboard aftertaste.  While their characters were enjoyable to watch, they lacked the depth needed to really pull further at my heartstrings.  I knew what sort of characters they were, but they needed to take one more step to fully make me believe they were who they were pretending to be.  Earlier I used the word arrogant when describing this film through free association.  I use this word because I believe writer Segal and director Hiller knew what they had for audiences by the end of their film, they knew that if they kept these two one-dimensional characters together long enough; they would have the audiences coming back by the third act.  To me, this ploy seemed arrogant of them.  Give us more, give us characters, give us at least impressive scenery - but instead we were handed one phrase and tears.  Not enough.Not complaining, but the music could have benefited from either a dedicated theme song or a better composer, the strum of the piano chords never quite hit that level of emotion I needed to bawl my eyes out.  The music was potent at first, but by the second act, it felt stale of overplayed.  It wasn't the theme music of Oliver and Jennifer's love that could have further strengthened their relationship.  Coupled with elaborately bad edits, our film stands solely on the doorstep of the actors.  They are good, not quite great, but worth viewing merely for those small moments of joy where you feel like you are watching a film, not being a sinister voyeur on their lives.  ""Love Story"" is a sad love story, alas, it needed something more - a stronger element that would have shown Oliver's hatred for his father, his dedication to his life, and his ability to discover love anywhere in life.  One needed a few more chapters of the book translated to the screen to make these characters full bodied enough to bring that climactic ending to a stand still.  Instead, Hiller's direction just made it feel like an opus of clich&eacute;s.Overall, ""Love Story"" was worth the singular view, but repeat viewings will not be needed.  The choice of casting Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw was superb, these were two people that could carry the weight of this world on their shoulders, but Hiller never gave it to them.  There was never that ""oh yea"" moment in the film, where we suddenly realized who these two were, and why they were together ... mind, body, and spirit.  Not thinking about the dreadful ""A Walk to Remember"", this film could benefit from a facelift.  Build the two characters stronger together, introduce more problems for the two to solve, really illustrate the confusion between Oliver and his father, and I think you would have yet another blockbuster on your hands.  This is a rich film, executed poorly, but the groundlings are there.  ""Love Story"" felt like a cold flat soda - it still quenches your thirst on a hot day, but it just misses that punch.  Worth at least one viewing for that romantic settling down in all of us.Grade: ***  out of *****",3,What Does Constitute an Apology?,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,6388,"['film', 'sad.This', 'film',

Being a Boston student myself I can tell you one of the most amazing things about this movie is the shooting around this incredible city.However, there's a lot more to ""Love Story"" than setting - the story is basically yet another modern day Romeo and Juliet - though not exactly, by any means. It's refreshingly simple and touching - and was such a major hit in 1970 (so says my mother) that it attracted around-the-block lines for weeks on end.The catchphrase, Love means never having to say you're sorry, came 13th in a recent AFI list of top movie quotes of all time - and really, it does catch the essence of this great love movie. These two souls really do understand one another, and if we take nothing else away from this film, it is the understanding of that love, and how it relates to all other loves we have ever had.

574488,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000059TEQ,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 5]","When I was a boy, the film that dominated my earliest memories of pop culture was 1970's Love Story. From the music to the saying, `Love means never having to say you're sorry,' to Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal being everywhere, it was the biggest movie of its day; sort of what Titanic was to folks a decade ago. And, yes, like Titanic, it's a schlocky film. It has a few saving graces which place it above the doomed ocean liner picture, though. One, there's no Leonardo DiCaprio in the film. Yes, Ali MacGraw was a terribly wooden actress. Her wooden performance here is mind-numbing. But, it's still not as earnestly bad as DiCaprio's. Second, despite the title being meant to refer to the film's two leads, Oliver and Jenny, played by O'Neal and MacGraw, the far more interesting love story is that played out between father and son. O'Neal plays Oliver Barrett IV, while Ray Milland plays his father, Oliver Barrett III. And, it is this relationship, between WASP scion and patriarch, that is so good that it carries the otherwise predictable soap opera of a film over the threshold to passability as a film. Is it a great film? No way, but Ray Milland does give a great performance as the emotionally impotent father.The film was directed by Arthur Hiller, a serviceable Hollywood journeyman, and adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name, by Erich Segal. I used to get Segal and the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull, by Richard Bach, mixed up all the time, because of the Segal/Seagull and Erich/Bach `ch' connections. Also, both films come from the dippy-doo era of American literature. Anyone who is in their mid-forties or older will know the tale, but for the young'uns, a brief recap. Young Oliver meets Jenny Cavellari on campus, at Harvard. She goes to Radcliffe. They have a series of very fast paced scenes that are ill-wrought dialogue-wise. Nonetheless, much happens in the first twenty to thirty minutes, and, in this way, Love Story was a precursor to the MTV-like editing style that has gripped film for the last twenty or so years. But, technically, the film is quite good. Its use of montage, superimposition, scoring (although, at two or three times the theme song intrudes too loudly), editing, and giving snippets of a scene and letting the viewer fill in the rest, works, and credit should go to Hiller for giving his cinematographer, Dick Kratina, room to experiment. In modern films, this utilitarian concision does not happen.

What do you know about love at that age but my sister was all blubbery.  I've just celebrated my first wedding anniversary with my wife and I wanted to get her a quintessential romance flick so why not but...""Love Story"".  Unless you've never been in love or are inherently cynical you can't appreciate how this film captures the experience of being totally immersed in another person.  The film's catchphrase, ""Love means never having to never say your sorry"" doesn't seem that corny.  Even the film's tragic conclusion doesn't seem contrived or manipulative.  I think it helps that the film's stars, Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw, have kinetic chemistry even though I believe they were married to others at the time(MacGraw was married to Paramount honcho Robert Evans).  An interesting dichotemy here is how the film presents O'Neal and MacGraw's fathers.  O'Neal is saddled with a rich controlling father (Ray Milland) whereas MacGraw's father (John Marley) is a widower and MacGraw kind of assumes the spousal role in her relationship to him.  Now I don't know if that explains the attraction between the two leads but it's interesting food for thought.

The Oscar for best score went to Francis Lai for this soundtrack, and deservedly so. Another album came out during this time entitled 'Francis Lai plays Francis Lai'. I'd never really heard any other music by this French composer before 'Love Story', but bought the album and really enjoyed  the tracks from previous movies, including 'A Man and a Woman', and I believe also 'Rider on the Rain'. I wish I could remember the other tracks, and also wish I could find it on CD. I no longer have the LPs due to their being stolen during a military move in the late '70s.

It had an extremely generic sounding title (kinda like naming a movie, ""Action Adventure""), a repetitive and overly melodramatic musical score, amateurish storyline, stilted dialogue, and uninspired acting (except Ali Mcgraw - she CAN act). And what the heck did they mean by ""Love means never having to say you're sorry!""? Now that really didn't make a lotta sense! God, the whole thing practically bordered on camp! But you know what, if you just go in to see it without any great expectations, but knowing full well what you're getting into, somehow it works! That's the genius of this movie - not great film making, just surprisingly entertaining fluff! Yeah, I hate to admit, I did enjoy it, even though I wasn't born when it was first released, and viewed the movie as a relic of an older generation. Ali Mcgraw was 32 at the time when the movie was made, playing the character of a girl between 20-25. Granted she was beautiful, but c'mon who were they fooling?? Still it's kind of hard to imagine any other actress who could play the Jennifer Cavaleri role better. Ms. Mcgraw with her cute smile, sweet voice, beautiful long hair, and dewey eyes helps make you overlook the obvious, well almost.... It was also kind of interesting to see a cameo appearance by a very young Tommy Lee Jones (with hair no less!). And it's interesting to know that the Oliver Barrett character was inspired by former Vice President Al Gore. I started thinking about this movie again when I saw the 2002 Oscars, and saw a very aged and bloated Ryan O'Neil and Ali Mcgraw (both in their 60's) coming on stage as presenters with the musical score from Love Story playing as they appeared. It was so surreal.

Both O'Neal and MacGraw are rather good, I can't imagine what torment Arthur Hiller put Ali MacGraw through to get her to deliver those line readings which, by and large, are pretty appropriate and hardly ever wooden as she usually is in other vehicles.  I femember years later watching the miniseries THE WINDS OF WAR in which she plays Natalie Jastrow and thinking, in retrospect, that Arthur Hiller deserved an Oscar for making her seem like a human being in LOVE STORY.  There's one scene in which she opens an invitation for Oliver's father to his 60th birthday party, a sign she thinks that her father in law might be melting in his opposition to their marriage, and yet she can't make Oliver understand how much this means to her and how very much she wants to go to the party.Instead he coldly forces her to RSVP and say that they won't go.  Her frustration and pain while she's dialing the phone are palpable, real.  PLUS she's dressed exquisitely, in a khaki green miniskirt with a metallic green and black belt that would look perfectly in vogue today.  It's the kind of scene that sticks with you, especially in a movie so universally reviled, a movie that has millions of fans and yet, for others, it seems to have gone down in history as the sappiest and stupidest movie ever made.What is with the actor Walker Reynolds, who plays Ryan O'Neal's best friend and racketball partner?  He's like a blond, somewhat stockier Illya Kuryakin.  The racquetball scenes with the two men in crazily tight white cotton shorts and T-shirts is like something out of a Bruce Weber campaign, and their subsequent shower scene should be frozen forever as a certain kinf of Abercrombie & Fitch porn.  The actor is appealing and yet, apparently, never made another movie before or since.  You wonder why he was even in the picture at all.  (He plays ""Ray Stratton."")  The focus of LOVE STORY is almost entirely on one or the other of the two leads, and Jennifer appears to have no girlfriends at all.  She exists in a cocoon first of forbidden love, and then in a hospital bed, after an interlude of watching Oliver skate in a white cable-knit sweater, then they go out for cocoa, and then he asks her what they should do for the rest of the day, she says, ""let's go to the hospital.""  The two of them stagger in a long shot out of Central Park into a cab.  It really looks as though she's going to die in the snow, her legs crumbling in on themselves like Bambi trying to stand up.  When she made it into the cab I was sighing real relief.  I guess somewhere along the way I started to fall for the two lovers.

574523,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B000059TEQ,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[5, 8]","Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw invented the chick flick with this 1970 film adaptation of Erich Segal's syrupy novel of the same name. It's hard to rate LOVE STORY. Everything you can say about it is true: It tugs at the heartstrings, it epitomizes young love, it's emotional and it's moving; it's also maudlin, contrived, mechanical and false. Whether this is a Best Picture nominee or a low-budget pile of tripe really depends entirely on your mood. The cloying sweetness of the brief, poignant relationship between Oliver Barrett IV and Jenny Cavilleri is melded together with pathos---nay, bathos---in a mixture that will bring tears to your eyes, either from sorrow or stunned hilarity. Again, it's all dependent on your mood.Jenny is a Radcliffe girl, yes, but she got to Radcliffe and then Harvard by dint of intelligence and perseverance. Her father owns a bakery in New York. Oliver is a Harvard Legacy boy, whose remoter ancestors came over on the Mayflower and whose more recent ancestors owned the factories that Jenny's forebears probably worked in. They meet and fall deeply, ineradicably in love.Oliver is preternaturally embarrassed by his family's wealth and status. He has distanced himself from his father (whom he calls ""Sir"" throughout the film, except for once), played by Ray Milland as Oliver Barrett III. ""Sir"" is not a warm father, but he seems more clumsy than venial in attempting to smooth Oliver's way through life. ""Sir"" can fix everything with a phone call, and he is dumbfounded by Oliver's refusal to allow him to intercede in getting him into Harvard Law School, getting him a job with the ""right"" Firm, funding his lifestyle, and advising him on his marriage. All in all, however, ""Sir"" remains distant but gracious toward his son and daughter-in-law. Oliver is surprisingly boorish toward him.Jenny and Oliver's idyll comes to an abrupt end when she is diagnosed with Leukemia, a certain killer in 1970. The constant grayness of the winter scenes effectively foreshadow the death that defines this film.Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are both impossibly young in LOVE STORY. The chemistry between them is palpable and adds to the film's effect (O'Neal once said that he has loved only two women in his life, Farrah Fawcett and Ali MacGraw). MacGraw's scenes with O'Neal sparkle, though her acting is otherwise wooden and her toneless recitation of some of the dialogue is so jarring as to be disturbing. Given the time and place, I had to wonder what, if anything, she was using recreationally.LOVE STORY either descends or ascends into hell or heaven at this point, becoming the tear-jerker nonpareil of all time. As Jenny becomes more ill she becomes even more loving and more beautiful; she's apparently suffering from a cosmetic blood disorder, an overabundance of the Max Factor.LOVE STORY's tag line, ""Love means never having to say you're sorry,"" warped a generation of young women for whom the flawed, human flesh-and-blood men they met could not, ever, pass the Oliver Test. The unmeetable romantic expectations of LOVE STORY probably fueled the divorce rate and filled out the ranks of single adults in the Me Decade. Of course, love means being entirely able to say you're sorry when the occasion demands; unless your partner loves you so uncritically that apologies never enter into your relationship, as they don't in this film; but, of course, it is only a film. Forty years on, today's jaded audience most likely will never forget that.",2,"""Where do I begin . . . ?""

574530,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B000059TEQ,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[2, 4]","Contrary to popular belief, Love Story is not based on a novel by Erich Segal. Author Erich Segal wrote the screenplay first, then adapted it into a novel - which was quickly published before the film's release and became a runaway bestseller.In 1970, Love Story took the nation by storm and made stars out of Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw. By today's standards, the story has been done so often and so much more dramatically, it seems a bit dated. The film has become very overrated over the years, but it still manages to be a sweet, effective love story, just not as tear enducing as some people say.With that said, I enjoyed the film a lot. The two leads have wonderful chemistry and deliver powerful performances. The haunting theme has gone down in history and is one of the most recognizable in all of film. It is a beautiful piece that lingers in the mind and is very difficult to forget.While ""Love Story"" is certainly a pleasant movie, aside from the tragic ending, and one that I enjoy watching, especially for Ali MacGraw's beautiful smile, it is only slightly above average. It of course coined the phrase ""love means never having to say you're sorry"", which sounds good but in fact is worthless tripe. Anyone who knows what love really is also knows the value, the importance of saying ""I'm sorry"" when it is warranted. However it is amazing how many people latched on to this phrase, just because it was in a movie.This is one of the first films, if not the first, of its kind, and spawned many imitators. It doesn't have the effect I assume it had over thirty years ago, but as far as sappy romances go, this is one of the best I've seen. Worth a watch for its classic status and Best Picture nomination alone.

Of course, now such ideas have become mainstream--perhaps even quaint--even though the abandonment of God and the normalization of non-marital sex has hardly resulted in human flourishment.As I watched the movie, the following passages from the Bible came to mind:Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. (Ephesians 6:4a)The fool says in his heart, ""There is no God."" (Psalm 14:1)And he told them a parable, saying, ""The land of a rich man produced plentifully,  and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?'  And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.  And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.'  But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'  So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.""

There is nothing to spoil love, trust, confidence or even the events... Jenny seems to die... She just escapes in loveliness...Jenny (Ali MacGraw) is half of a pretty young married students from a working class background... And Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) is from a very wealthy family... Both have the predictable problems with disapproving parents... Both struggle along through hard times, until Oliver obtains a fine job with his own merit... When Jenny tries to get pregnant, the doctor finds out that she has an incurable disease, and has a very short time to live...Ryan O'Neal plays well the intense sensitive rebel, giving a heart-breaking performance as the ultra-rich man's son who works to pay his way through law school when his father won't...Ali MacGraw is good and touching in her portrait of Jenny, the dying heroine, the poor baker's daughter studying classical music at Radcliffe, the smart young girl who gives up her plans to study in Europe in order to marry Oliver... She never missed a 'shred of her beauty' in her role...Ray Milland is the 60-year-old Oliver Barrett III... He is a strong, articulate, civilized millionaire from Boston who refuses to support his son in marrying a girl of such low social stature... He commands him instead to finish law school...John Harley is Phil, the father of Jenny... For him, ""Father's love is something to cherish and respect.""There is three sequences that I liked the most in the film:- Jenny and Oliver wonderful kissing scene... From this point on, both were entirely engrossed with each other, ready to risk anything for love...- Oliver's long day search looking for Jenny, until he sees her sitting, outside, on a stair... She forgot her keys... Jenny is comforted by Oliver who tries to apologize for his continual disputes... Jenny, all shaken, and with tears in her eyes and with an emotional voice stops him with words of deep affection: ""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""- Oliver, sitting alone and lost to the world, uncertain and perplexed, unable to understand Jenny's tragic fate... If Jenny could spend an hour in his mind, a minute in his heart, a second in his soul to discover what he really feels loving her... Why Jenny has to die so young? Why destiny is against us sometimes, smashing all our hopes and happiness? Why we feel so impotent in front of the will of God? Why can't we understand that we are 'blessed with Life,' and this is our great gift, our true treasure! Barrett's millions could never save Jenny!The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran said once: ""Love knows not its own depth, until the hour of separation."" And let me say that 'nothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of Life.' They say: Time mends a broken heart and true love never ends... But if true love never ended then time wouldn't have to mend... So ""Love Story"" was followed by ""Oliver's Story"".Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are splendid and beautifully matched... Arthur Hill's sincere direction commend the picture to a wide audience eager to a flood of tears...""Love Story"" won 7 Academy Award nominations and Frances Lai - touching music - mixed by Bach, Mozart and Handel, won an Oscar, enriching the beauty of the film...An intense, tough-looking leading actor is seen: Tommy Lee Jones in his film debut...",3,"""Love knows not its own depth, until the hour of separation.""",1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,3439,"['sentimentality', 'Love', 'Story', 'What', 'can', 'say', '25-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'died', 'hearty', 'welcome', 'retreat', 'past', 'nothing', 'spoil', 'love', 'trust', 'confidence', 'even', 'events', 'Jenny', 'die', 'just', 'escapes', 'loveliness', 'Jenny', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'half', 'pretty', 'young', 'married', 'students', 'working', 'class', 'background', 'Oliver', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'very', 'wealthy', 'family', 'have', 'predictable', 'problems', 'disapproving', 'parents', 'struggle', 'hard', 'times', 'Oliver', 'fine', 'job', 'own', 'merit', 'When', 'Jenny', 'get', 'pregnant', 'doctor', 'out', 'incurable', 'disease', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'well', 'intense', 'sensitive', 'rebel', 'giving', 'heart-breaking', 'performance', 'ultra-rich', 'man', 'son', 'who', 'pay', 'way', 'law', 'school', 'when', 'father', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'good', 'touching', 'portrait', 'Jenny', 'dying', 'heroine', 'poor', 'baker', 'daughter', 'studying', 'classical', 'music', 'Radcliffe', 'smart', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'plans', 'study', 'Europe', 'order', 'marry', 'Oliver', 'never', 'missed', ""'shred"", 'beauty', 'role', 'Ray', 'Milland', '60-year-old', 'Oliver', 'Barrett', 'III', 'strong', 'articulate', 'civilized', 'millionaire', 'Boston', 'who', 'support', 'son', 'marrying', 'girl', 'such', 'low', 'social', 'stature', 'instead', 'finish', 'law', 'school', 'John', 'Harley', 'Phil', 'father', 'Jenny', 'Father', 'love', 'something', 'cherish', 'respect', 'three', 'sequences', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'Jenny', 'Oliver', 'wonderful', 'kissing', 'scene', 'point', 'were', 'entirely', 'engrossed', 'other', 'ready', 'risk', 'anything', 'love', 'Oliver', 'long', 'day', 'search', 'looking', 'Jenny', 'sitting', 'outside', 'stair', 'forgot', 'keys', 'Jenny', 'comforted', 'Oliver', 'who', 'apologize', 'continual', 'disputes', 'Jenny', 'shaken', 'tears', 'eyes', 'emotional', 'voice', 'stops', 'words', 'deep', 'affection', 'Love', 'never', 'having', 'say', ""'re"", 'sorry', 'Oliver', 'sitting', 'alone', 'lost', 'world', 'uncertain', 'perplexed', 'unable', 'understand', 'Jenny', 'tragic', 'fate', 'Jenny', 'could', 'spend', 'hour', 'mind', 'minute', 'heart', 'second', 'soul', 'discover', 'what', 'really', 'loving', 'Why', 'Jenny', 'die', 'so', 'young', 'Why', 'destiny', 'sometimes', 'smashing', 'hopes', 'happiness', 'Why', 'feel', 'so', 'impotent', 'front', 'will', 'God', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'are', ""'blessed"", 'Life', 'great', 'gift', 'true', 'treasure', 'Barrett', 'millions', 'could', 'never', 'save', 'Jenny', 'Lebanese', 'poet', 'Khalil', 'Gibran', 'said', 'once', 'Love', 'not', 'own', 'depth', 'hour', 'separation', 'let', 'say', ""'nothing"", 'more', 'beautiful', 'love', 'weathered', 'storms', 'Life', 'say', 'Time', 'broken', 'heart', 'true', 'love', 'never', 'true', 'love', 'never', 'ended', 'then', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'mend', 'So', 'Love', 'Story', 'was', 'followed', 'Oliver', 'Story', '.Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'are', 'splendid', 'beautifully', 'matched', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'sincere', 'direction', 'commend', 'picture', 'wide', 'audience', 'eager', 'flood', 'tears', 'Love', 'Story', 'won', '7', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Frances', 'Lai', 'touching', 'music', 'mixed', 'Bach', 'Mozart', 'Handel', 'won', 'Oscar', 'enriching', 'beauty', 'film', 'intense', 'tough-looking', 'leading', 'actor', 'seen', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'film', 'debut']",N/A

The ""love story"" involves two students from Harvard: The guy (Ryan O'Neal) is a likable hockey player from an incredibly rich family who doesn't get along with his rigidly high-class father (Ray Milland); the gal (Ali MacGraw) is an intelligent musician from a working-class family who strangely calls her father ""Phil"" and cusses a lot.When I first saw the film, over four years ago, I didn't much like Ali MacGraw's character. She comes off bizarre and annoying (""Hey preppy"" -- ""preppy"" ""preppy"" ""preppy""). O'Neal's character, on the other hand, I found to be an all-around likable guy -- tough but at the same time very nice, filthy rich yet undenialby humble and respectful.MacGraw's character kinda turned me off to the the flick the first time I saw it. Seeing it again recently, I enjoyed ""Love Story"" more because I was prepared to handle and embrace her strange personality.The father/son 'relationship' is very interesting: O'Neal calls Milland ""sir"" at all times. In reality there's NO relationship at all. Hence, what ultimately takes place in the story is both understandable and believable.There's a funny scene when O'Neal finally takes MacGraw to his family estate to meet his parents. She's understandably overwhelmed when she realizes just how rich O'Neal's family actually is. Her true-to-character reaction made me bust out laughing.I enjoyed the New England locations and seasonal changes. The setting and tone naturally reminded me of ""Dead Poets Society."" I'm not saying ""Love Story"" is anywhere near as good because ""Dead Poets Society"" is in a class by itself. Yet, ""Love Story"" is a good drama/romance; I technically rate it 3.5/5 Stars. Just keep in mind that it's from 1970. Viewing it is like going back in time; in other words, it's a fascinating period-piece.",4,Good 1970 Drama/Romance,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,1903,"['Everyone', 'theme', 'music', 'one', 'what', 'hear', 'film', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'students', 'Harvard', 'guy', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'likable', 'hockey', 'player', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'family', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'rigidly', 'high-class', 'father', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'gal', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'intelligent', 'musician', 'working-class', 'family', 'who', 'strangely', 'father', 'Phil', 'lot.When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'character', 'bizarre', 'annoying', 'Hey', 'preppy', 'preppy', 'preppy', 'preppy', ""O'Neal"", 'character', 'other', 'hand', 'found', 'be', 'all-around', 'likable', 'guy', 'tough', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'nice', 'filthy', 'rich', 'yet', 'undenialby', 'humble', 'respectful.MacGraw', 'character', 'kinda', 'turned', 'flick', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Seeing', 'again', 'recently', 'enjoyed', 'Love', 'Story', 'more', 'was', 'prepared', 'handle', 'embrace', 'strange', 'personality.The', 'father/son', 'very', 'interesting', ""O'Neal"", 'Milland', 'sir', 'times', 'reality', 'relationship', 'Hence', 'what', 'ultimately', 'place', 'story', 'understandable', 'funny', 'scene', 'when', ""O'Neal"", 'finally', 'MacGraw', 'family', 'estate', 'meet', 'parents', 'understandably', 'overwhelmed', 'when', 'just', 'how', 'rich', ""O'Neal"", 'family', 'actually', 'true-to-character', 'reaction', 'made', 'bust', 'out', 'laughing.I', 'enjoyed', 'New', 'England', 'locations', 'seasonal', 'changes', 'setting', 'tone', 'naturally', 'reminded', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Love', 'Story', 'anywhere', 'near', 'good', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'class', 'Yet', 'Love', 'Story', 'good', 'drama/romance', 'technically', 'rate', '3.5/5', 'Stars', 'Just', 'keep', 'mind', '1970', 'Viewing', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'other', 'words', 'fascinating', 'period-piece']",N/A

I believe it mostly has to do with Ali MacGraw's performance and character.Many people call this a tearjerker, but to me it almost gave off a heartfelt and warm feeling. Watch for yourself and see what you get out of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a GOOD and FRESH chick flick - this is coming from a reviewer who hates your typical slapped together romantic comedy. I might be watching it again before I return it to the library.",4,Love means never having to say you are sorry &#10084;,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,593,"['rented', 'movie', 'local', 'library', 'yesterday', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'simple', 'certain', 'charm', 'chick', 'flick', 'believe', 'mostly', 'do', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'performance', 'character.Many', 'people', 'call', 'tearjerker', 'almost', 'gave', 'off', 'heartfelt', 'warm', 'feeling', 'Watch', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'GOOD', 'FRESH', 'chick', 'flick', 'coming', 'reviewer', 'who', 'typical', 'slapped', 'together', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'might', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'return', 'library']",N/A
