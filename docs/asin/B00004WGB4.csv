While some moments tend to be a bit slow, it's rare that it drags the show into the duldrums. Troughton is funny and intelligent, and even more so you see the serious side of him. Also, you finally learn a lot more about where the Doctor comes from and who he is.It is interesting how they pull together a large number of different era's into one story. You never quite knew what you would find next. To me, the anticipation of the next discovery is what made this story so great.My first time viewing I watched it taped off the air (before the VHS I now proudly own was available). In spite of a pause button at my command, I sat for over 2 hours watching it with the urge to go, not wanting to break away from the story.

555151,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B00004WGB4,Adam,"[0, 0]","This is the last second doctor serial with Patrick Troughton and its a fitting send off. The main storyline in which the Doctor lands seems to land in 1917 and he and his companions are convicted of being spies and traitors sets off an epic plot that will force the Doctor to call for and eventually face his own people. This is the first time that viewers get to see the Time Lords and get a glimpse at the doctor's true origin. The story really does run a long gamut leading to a downbeat finale for the second doctor where neither he nor his companions go easily. Long before David Tennant, the second doctor didn't want to go. Despite some pretty silly attempts at foreign accents, this is a milestone story that's worth viewing.",5,The Second Doctor Goes Down Fighting,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,733,"['last', 'second', 'doctor', 'serial', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'fitting', 'send', 'main', 'storyline', 'Doctor', 'land', '1917', 'companions', 'are', 'convicted', 'being', 'spies', 'traitors', 'sets', 'off', 'epic', 'plot', 'will', 'force', 'Doctor', 'call', 'eventually', 'face', 'own', 'people', 'first', 'time', 'viewers', 'get', 'see', 'Time', 'Lords', 'get', 'glimpse', 'doctor', 'true', 'origin', 'story', 'really', 'run', 'long', 'gamut', 'leading', 'downbeat', 'finale', 'second', 'doctor', 'where', 'neither', 'companions', 'go', 'easily', 'Long', 'before', 'David', 'Tennant', 'second', 'doctor', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'pretty', 'silly', 'attempts', 'foreign', 'accents', 'milestone', 'story', 'worth', 'viewing']",N/A

This was the most ambitious of the Who stories at the time, and was only eclipsed(not in quality mind you) by the Trial of a Timelord storyline.  The story can get a bit repetitive at times, but it is a good yarn, well worth watching.  You just knew watching the parts that something huge was going to happen!  Troughton was so amazing in the role, and so many don't ""know"" him as well as the other actors who played the lead role because so many of his episodes, including some of the most famous episodes are lost for all time.  This one is monumental in terms of what happemns.One of the best parts of this story is the treatment of the timelords and Gallifrey(though neither term is sued here).  Both were used sparingly to great effect.  We are given morsels, tidbits of where the Doctor is from and the power of ""his people.""  Though I loved the stories that followed about Gallifrey and the Timelords, it was nice not to know a lot about the Doctirs past or where he came from.  The inclusion of backstory added a lot to the character, but in the process, removed some of the mystery and aura surrounding the character.  This is really must see Who.  Pity none of the characters introduced here, especially what seems to be another timelord(the Master anyone?!?) never returend.  Perhaps with the popularity of the new sereis, that can be rectified.  This really is monumental Who, but it is best viewed in chunks and not in one showing, or the repetitive parts will begin to annoy.",4,Who did Epic before ther was Epic,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,1550,"['Dr.', 'Who', 'was', 'doing', 'epic', 'storylines', 'were', 'en', 'vogue', 'was', 'most', 'ambitious', 'Who', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'eclipsed', 'not', 'quality', 'Trial', 'Timelord', 'storyline', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'times', 'good', 'yarn', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'knew', 'watching', 'parts', 'something', 'huge', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Troughton', 'was', 'so', 'amazing', 'role', 'so', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'including', 'most', 'famous', 'episodes', 'are', 'lost', 'time', 'one', 'monumental', 'terms', 'what', 'happemns.One', 'best', 'parts', 'story', 'treatment', 'timelords', 'Gallifrey', 'term', 'sued', 'here', 'were', 'used', 'sparingly', 'great', 'effect', 'are', 'given', 'morsels', 'tidbits', 'where', 'Doctor', 'power', 'people', 'loved', 'stories', 'followed', 'Gallifrey', 'Timelords', 'was', 'nice', 'not', 'know', 'lot', 'Doctirs', 'past', 'where', 'came', 'inclusion', 'backstory', 'added', 'lot', 'character', 'process', 'removed', 'mystery', 'aura', 'surrounding', 'character', 'really', 'must', 'see', 'Who', 'Pity', 'none', 'characters', 'introduced', 'here', 'especially', 'what', 'be', 'timelord', 'Master', 'anyone', 'never', 'returend', 'Perhaps', 'popularity', 'new', 'sereis', 'can', 'be', 'rectified', 'really', 'monumental', 'Who', 'best', 'viewed', 'chunks', 'not', 'one', 'showing', 'repetitive', 'parts', 'will', 'begin', 'annoy']",N/A

War games is an excellent example except for the long and boring first four episodes.  It gets interesting in five-ten.  The only thing I truely hate are the ""american"" accents.  They are absolutely horrible.  I am not too insulted though, I do a lousy brit accent myself.  I didn't think I would like Patrick Troughton(a little before my time I was born in 1970) but I do.

James Bree came on a bit too strong I got the impression he wanted the War Chief part, but Decider Neifred in Full Circle was a better role for him.The scene I looked forward too most, of course, was the regeneration scene, just as I had in Tenth Planet.

555154,AW135H6P4JXKC,B00004WGB4,buckbooks,"[6, 6]","The standard knock on this sprawling 10-part story is that it begins with a strong premise, shows the Time Lords and the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey for the first time, and pads out the middle with a lot of chase scenes that don't do much to advance the story. Watching it 40 years on, I found most of the criticisms overstated.""The War Games"" indeed gets off to a rousing start: The Doctor and his companions land the TARDIS in No Man's Land during World War I and are rescued from an artillery barrage by a lady ambulance driver. As revealed in the commentary, the BBC promoted the story in advance as a straight-up time-travel adventure set on Earth. By the end of Episode One, however, viewers learn they're in for something more when the British general starts communicating with unseen aliens through a video screen behind his office portrait of George V!It's gradually revealed that the Doctor and his friends are actually on an alien planet divided into war zones where soldiers have been transported from different time periods on Earth to fight out their respective conflicts and, if they survive, earn themselves a place in an alien super army. The politics are carefully understated, and the story follows a more or less logical course through the 10 episodes, which manage to sustain viewer interest remarkably well.First, the Doctor and his allies must track down a map to the different war zones, then travel to an unmarked zone in the middle of the map which they reason must be the control center, and so on until they link up with soldiers from the various time periods who have thrown off the alien conditioning and formed a resistance movement. The cast includes multiple, nefarious villains who casually manipulate the human armies for their sport, led by the War Lord (Philip Madoc, who would go on to play Solon in ""The Brain of Morbius"" and numerous other BBC television roles).The aliens' TARDIS-like technology for transporting soldiers through time and space breaks down, and the Doctor must ask the Time Lords of Gallifrey to intervene to return the soldiers to Earth and their respective time periods. This momentous plot development sets up the Time Lords' first trial of the Doctor for interfering with history, which leads to his second regeneration, the end of Jamie and Zoe's sojourn as companions, and the Doctor's exile to Earth as an agent of UNIT.

His stories were ravaged by the BBC many years ago, and only a handful have been recovered. The first story is missing, important episodes like ""The Highlanders"" and ""The Enemy of the World"" are gone. Even episodes with popular villains such as the Daleks and Cybermen are missing.Thankfully one of the few stories still intact is the last story. The ten part masterpiece, ""The War Games"", is the swansong for the Second Doctor, Jamie and Zoe. It also introduces the Time Lords as a group, shows us a rival Time Lord to the Doctor in the form of the War Chief, and has a nice, epic feel to it that hasn't really been captured in too many other stories. It was also the last of the black and white stories.There are certain problems with the story. For one, it's quite well-padded and redundant in parts. Truth be told, it could've been done as a four-part story and worked every bit as well, but that's a minor gripe.Special features on this three-disc collection include such things as commentaries, features on the Target novels and the comic strip, and much more!Overall this is a heck of a story and a great collection.

555156,A11GO5VA74HD8K,B00004WGB4,Crazy Fox,"[5, 5]","As the last Doctor Who story of the 1960's, ""The War Games"" seems to be encapsulating and then enlarging on all that was unique and wonderful about the series during its black & white decade, and it succeeds with flying colors. The story hits the ground running and draws the viewer in as it goes, disguising itself first as a good solid historical story for which the show was known but set in the midst of the First World War, then quietly introducing curiously anomalous elements leading the attentive observer to gradually assume that this is a pseudo-historical of a sort the show had innovated and developed, finally frustrating this expectation for something in a way even stranger yet--and much more sinister. Patrick Troughton's portrayal of the Doctor as clownishly bungling if only to disarm his opponents amuses here as always, but also serves to accentuate the bleak and grim fact that now for once the situation spins more out of his control with his every move, until his palpable panic when he's forced to involve his own people (the Time Lords, as revealed here for the first time) is positively electrifying. In the end, he is punished for saving the day, but not before articulating his reasons for doing so with classic eloquence indelibly defining this character forevermore.At ten episodes long and in a pivotal position in the show's history, this rare masterpiece has so much that could be noted about it, and different things will stand out to different folks. Something that strikes me first is that here is a science fiction storyline that only the BBC could get away with without looking shoddy or half-baked; their experience and expertise in historical dramas, their attention to accurate detail in sets and costumes, allows ""The War Games"" to manage not just one realistically believable war zone but many, each one quite distinct. And the ragtag collection of renegades assembled from all different historical eras is a weird sight you'll only ever see in Doctor Who. Just as intriguing in a way is the story's attitude to war as a whole, touching on its horrors and absurdities in a responsible manner appropriate to the show's format and audience, generally taking a dim view of it but not in a gratingly preachy manner. On a different note, there is something clearly archetypal going on in the battle of wits between the Doctor and the War Chief, another renegade Time Lord who, like the Doctor, does ""tend to get involved in things"" but out of aggressive self-interest. Retrospectively speaking, it's hard not to see this one-off character as a prototype of the Master, but merely within the space of this story alone his rather bombastic mood swings nicely contrast with the smoothly calculating cruelty of the War Lord: a fine balance of complementary villainy, indeed.Speaking of complementary pairs, Jamie with his brawn and Zoe with her brains really shine here as the Doctor's companions, and the chemistry and friendship between these three characters seems so natural that the nature of their separation at the end is all the more poignant. The bad guys are defeated, and yet the tale ends on a plaintive note of heartbreaking loss. Few shows have the guts to do this, and of those few can manage it with such a sure touch of subtlety. To be honest, Doctor Who itself has kind of dropped the ball on this score more than once, making it all the more precious that ""The War Games"" aims true and on target as it does. Still, it's odd that four incarnations later the Doctor was put on trial again on the same charges--perhaps Time Lord jurisprudence has no concept of double jeopardy?",5,"""All these evils I have fought, while you have done nothing but observe!""",1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,3627,"['last', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', '1960', 'War', 'Games', 'be', 'encapsulating', 'then', 'enlarging', 'was', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'series', 'black', 'white', 'decade', 'flying', 'colors', 'story', 'ground', 'running', 'viewer', 'disguising', 'first', 'good', 'solid', 'historical', 'story', 'show', 'was', 'known', 'set', 'midst', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'then', 'quietly', 'introducing', 'curiously', 'anomalous', 'elements', 'leading', 'attentive', 'observer', 'gradually', 'assume', 'pseudo-historical', 'sort', 'show', 'had', 'innovated', 'developed', 'finally', 'frustrating', 'expectation', 'something', 'way', 'even', 'stranger', 'yet', 'much', 'more', 'sinister', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'portrayal', 'Doctor', 'clownishly', 'bungling', 'only', 'disarm', 'opponents', 'here', 'always', 'also', 'accentuate', 'bleak', 'grim', 'fact', 'now', 'once', 'situation', 'more', 'control', 'move', 'palpable', 'panic', 'when', 'forced', 'involve', 'own', 'people', 'Time', 'Lords', 'revealed', 'here', 'first', 'time', 'positively', 'electrifying', 'end', 'punished', 'saving', 'day', 'not', 'articulating', 'reasons', 'doing', 'so', 'classic', 'eloquence', 'indelibly', 'defining', 'character', 'forevermore.At', 'ten', 'episodes', 'long', 'pivotal', 'position', 'show', 'history', 'rare', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'noted', 'different', 'things', 'will', 'stand', 'out', 'different', 'folks', 'Something', 'strikes', 'first', 'here', 'science', 'fiction', 'storyline', 'only', 'BBC', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'looking', 'shoddy', 'half-baked', 'experience', 'expertise', 'historical', 'dramas', 'attention', 'accurate', 'detail', 'sets', 'costumes', 'War', 'Games', 'manage', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'realistically', 'believable', 'war', 'zone', 'many', 'one', 'quite', 'distinct', 'ragtag', 'collection', 'renegades', 'assembled', 'different', 'historical', 'eras', 'weird', 'sight', ""'ll"", 'only', 'ever', 'see', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Just', 'intriguing', 'way', 'story', 'attitude', 'war', 'whole', 'touching', 'horrors', 'absurdities', 'responsible', 'manner', 'appropriate', 'show', 'format', 'audience', 'generally', 'taking', 'dim', 'view', 'not', 'gratingly', 'preachy', 'manner', 'different', 'note', 'something', 'clearly', 'archetypal', 'going', 'battle', 'wits', 'Doctor', 'War', 'Chief', 'renegade', 'Time', 'Lord', 'who', 'Doctor', 'tend', 'get', 'involved', 'things', 'aggressive', 'self-interest', 'Retrospectively', 'speaking', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'one-off', 'character', 'prototype', 'Master', 'merely', 'space', 'story', 'alone', 'rather', 'bombastic', 'mood', 'swings', 'nicely', 'contrast', 'smoothly', 'calculating', 'cruelty', 'War', 'Lord', 'fine', 'balance', 'complementary', 'villainy', 'indeed.Speaking', 'complementary', 'pairs', 'Jamie', 'brawn', 'Zoe', 'brains', 'really', 'shine', 'here', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'chemistry', 'friendship', 'three', 'characters', 'so', 'natural', 'nature', 'separation', 'end', 'more', 'poignant', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'defeated', 'yet', 'tale', 'plaintive', 'note', 'heartbreaking', 'loss', 'Few', 'shows', 'have', 'guts', 'do', 'few', 'can', 'manage', 'sure', 'touch', 'subtlety', 'be', 'honest', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'kind', 'dropped', 'ball', 'score', 'more', 'once', 'making', 'more', 'precious', 'War', 'Games', 'true', 'target', 'Still', 'odd', 'four', 'incarnations', 'later', 'Doctor', 'was', 'put', 'trial', 'again', 'same', 'charges', 'perhaps', 'Time', 'Lord', 'jurisprudence', 'concept', 'double', 'jeopardy']",N/A

I'm talking a classic series fan then The Web of Fear is a MUST own for simply one reason alone: The Brigadier.Lethbridge-Stewart makes his debut here and as any classic series fan knows The Brig was just as great a character and Nicholas Courtney as great as any actor who portrayed The Doctor himself.Here he is introduced as a Colonel, but soon he would be The Brigadier, the only reason I'm giving this DVD release 4 stars out of 5 is because of the missing episode and it's the episode that actually introduces Stewart himself!!!Oh, well at least it's preserved in photosnaps and complete audio which work very well in this case to forward the story. Troughten is one of my favorite Doctors and if you're a Who fan but haven't discovered the first two Doctors yet go out and get as many of both as you can while the prices are still good and the DVD's are still in print because they are going fast!!!There very few 2nd Doctor DVD's available as complete stories which are: Tomb of the Cybermen, The Mind Robber, The Dominators, The Krotons, The Seeds of Death, The Enemy of the World and The War Games.Of which personally I like Tomb of the Cybermen, The Mind Robber, The Krotons and The War Games the best and The War Games is now out of print and overpriced... I was lucky to get my copy through Buybacks for a somewhat reasonable $40.00 including shipping but still quite a lot for one story of one show where many full seasons of shows are available for less!!!I have not seen The Invasion or The Ice Warriors but I with watching The Web of Fear online I am warming up to the DVD's that do have missing segments although it's still a crime that they haven't been able to recover those that were lost to time...Still I highly recommend snapping up the stories from the first two Doctors as soon as you can because they seem to be going out of print faster and you'll regret getting the latter Doctors first.My fav full Hartnell stories available on DVD are An Unearthly Child, The Daleks, The Aztecs, Planet of Giants, The Romans, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Space Museum and The War Machines. Which I highly recommend all of those, and every one is just as great a story as any of the later Doctors or new series episodes... especially The Aztecs, The Romans, Planet of Giants and The War Machines.Personally as for Troughten I recommend The Mind Robber and Tomb of the Cybermen first to get a feel for his style and then the rest as you can get them, not to mention The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors and if you can get ahold of it for a nice price The Two Doctors which is really the only Colin Baker story worth anything in my opinion. I'm glad I got mine because it's going for crazy money on here and there are certain key stories if you are a true Doctor Who fan and as with those the introduction of The Brigadier I would certainly categorize as being 'key'.Thanks for reading.By the way I am just re-editing my review and adding that Web of Feat showcased The Brig's first appearance admirable but I believe his last appearance in Doctor Who officially is in the Sylvester McCoy episode 'Battlefield' which is another of course overpriced DVD currently. If you are truly interested in snapping up William Hartnell (1st Doctor) and Patrick Troughten (2nd Doctor) stories go to the WBShop where currently they have on sale some select DVD's from different Doctors and two of which are The Gunfighters from the 1st Doctor for $16.99 and The War Games from the 2nd Doctor for only $35.89!!! Seriously, you can't find The War Games for that price ANYWHERE ELSE and it's really worth it. I may end up buying a second copy for myself as on Amazon, eBay and Barnes&Noble; it's going for over a hundred easily. Same with The Gunfighters, Planet of the Spider (3rd Doctor) and Time-Flight (5th Doctor) they are all on sale RIGHT NOW at the WBShop!I got mine right away as these are already out of print. I guess WB found some extra ones but they won't last long... The War Games is well worth it, it's nearly four hours long, 10 segments all complete and the 2nd Doctor's swan song (he regenerates) at the end of the story. It's also farewell for Jamie and Zoe his steadfast companions. And def worth the $35.00 price tag. It's an incredible story and as much as I loved The Web of Fear, The War Games outshines it so go get it!!!! :)",5,"HEY, DON'T SPEND $100.00 on Amazon go to the WBSHOP RIGHT NOW!!!!",1392076800,"02

555162,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B00004WGB4,Jason A. Miller,"[48, 48]","Everyone remembers the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) as the jolly, happy little fellow who always looked frazzled but never defeated.  His character always managed to escape the angst that seemed to afflict, say, the Fifth and Ninth Doctors on a regular basis, or the Tenth Doctor in every series finale.However, even 40 years later, the ordeal to which the Second Doctor is subjected in his swan song is kind of shocking.  ""The War Games"" opens with an iconic image, of the Doctor and his loyal companions Jamie and Zoe (well-played by Frazer Hines and Wendy Padbury) standing giggling in a mud puddle in the middle of No-Man's Land.  By the end of that week's episode, far from giggling in the mud, they've been captured, escaped, captured, court-martialed, and sentenced to death.  The World War I firing squad which the Doctor faces in the story's first cliffhanger is one of the grimmest fates his incarnation ever had to face.  While ""The War Games"" has been accused of being slow and padded, Episode One at least is nearly perfect in its pacing and increasingly downbeat tone.The writers (Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, two of ""Doctor Who""'s best scribes) slowly reveal the mystery over the course of the first several episodes.  In the opening act we see an anachronistic TV screen behind British lines.  In Episode Two we see the Doctor abruptly drive from France into Ancient Rome, and in Episode Three he's captured by an out-of-place TARDIS.  In Episode Four the Doctor is terrified to recognize one of the aliens responsible for manipulating the war zones, and by Episode Six we learn that the both the Doctor and the War Chief are members of the same race -- the Time Lords.  While it's inevitable that in a ""Doctor Who"" story of such length there are bound to be dull spots (here, Episodes Five and Six seem to be the most padded), overall the progression of ""The War Games"" is fast and unflinching.In the final two episodes, the Docttor learns that he can only defeat the War Chief and his allies by calling on the Time Lords for help -- but in so doing the audience learns, for the first time in the show's then six-year history, that the Doctor has been on the run from the Time Lords, and that to call them is to invite his own arrest.  The entirety of Episode Ten is devoted to the Doctor's capture and trial.  The inexorable nature of the Doctor's fate mirrors the grim World War I sequences, and the imposition of the Doctor's sentence in the closing moments is both terrifying and poignant.""The War Games"" is treated to one of the best jobs the Restoration Team has done in their near-decade on the job.  This 3-disc set features not only a pristine video restoration, but also an informative text commentary track and a very busy audio commentary booth.  The bonus disc is full of documentaries: a lengthy making-of feature, a historical piece on the various wars encountered in the story (although oddly no American professor is interviewed about the American Civil War), and a retrospective look at the Doctor's first nine regenerations (featuring side-splitting observations by various show writers).  We also get installments in the ongoing set of features about ""Doctor Who"" novelizations and comic strips.Take your time with ""The War Games"" DVD.  Overall this story is ""Doctor Who"" at the height of its power to both entertain and frighten, and after 40 years may be the ""Who"" story that has aged better than any other.",5,"""No! No! No! No!

Especially for a ten-parter. Most of the episodes are action-packed, the story is filled with mystery, all of the cliffhangers are truly great, the acting and directing is wonderfully played, the charaters are very engaging, the special effects aren't that bad, and the war settings and battle scenes are very realistic.The TARDIS has materialized in what appears to be a World War I battlefield. Immediately upon their arrival, the Doctor and his companions are bombarded with artillery shells. But when they are picked up by a British ambulance and taken to headquarters, they are charged as spies and sentenced to death. As the Doctor and his companions try to escape, they find some very odd things: a tele-communicator in the General's office and an 18th century Redcoat. Is this really the First World War? Why is the General so keen to get rid of the Doctor? Who are these mysterious aliens observing the war? And what connections does their War Chief have with the Doctor?As the Doctor finds himself fighting the most powerful enemy he has ever faced, the only solution left to him is to call for help from the very people he fears - his own people, the Time Lords.A great adventure that would be a shame to miss.

Now, in Doctor Who television history, the longer stories were either very well done or done so badly as to be unwatchable.  This is one of the former.  Spoilers, so be warned!  The story hooks you from the first few minutes and never lets up.  The characters get time to be developed, we care for a few of them, the plot is complex and seems to become more complex and twisted the more we get involved in it, and many of ideas are interesting.  We get not only the War Lords, but we get to meet the Time Lords, we get to see other time machines, and we get to see the Second Doctor forced into his change into the Third Doctor.There is humor, drama, and sadness as those characters who we loved say good bye to each other and to us.The plot is simple - Doctor and company find themselves in no-man's land in World War One.  But slowly they start to find tiny clues that suggest something is not right.  There is something big going on, very big.  And of course the Doctor has to see WHAT is going on.  I happen to think the Second Doctor played by Patrick Troughton is one of the best of the early Doctors and he acts his heart out here.  Frazer Hines and Wendy Padbury are wonderful as Jamie and Zoe.  The soft spoken Philip Madoc, as the War Lord, is one of the best villains on the small screen, EVER, in any show.  And he has been in Doctor Who before (The Krotons).This story feels huge.  The sweeping landscapes, the scope of the story, the number of actors and actresses who fill the rows of characters from across space and time.  This has the feel of a epic movie - the grandness of the vision was not let down by the people who labored to bring it into people's homes.  Everything from the special effects to the historical details hold up very well, outside of a few shaky tables.If there was a list for the top FIVE Doctor Who stories, I think this one would have to be one of the five.  THAN there are the extras.  Besides the wonderful commentary, we also get Now And Then which shows us the locations, comparing them from 1969 and now, we also get a ton of features about the Second Doctor, the comic strips and even the Target books.  This is the kind of DVD set you give to somebody who is a Who fan for their birthday gift or Christmas gift.

However as recient films such as THE LORD  OF THE RINGS &amp; HARRY POTTER have proven; long doesn't mean tedious.The episode starts out as usual with the Doctor &amp; company (Jamie &amp; Zoe) finding themselves in the middle of World War I.  What seems the normal confusion turns into puzzlement as they find themselves bouncing from WW I to The US Civil War to Ancient Rome.Over the ten parts the focus shifts as if it were several different episodes, first on the humans caught in the games, then to the aliens supervising the games, then to the human resistance, and finally to the Time Lords and the Doctors attempt to escape from his past.  Each part is pulled off and tied together well.  The plotting and performances are first rate.In the end the villians get their cumuppance but so does the Doctor leading to his exile and forced regeneration into his successor Jon Pertwee and several years of UNIT episodes.We get to see all the different sides of Troughton from this one.  If you had never seen him as the Doctor (As I hadden't at the time) you get a great sense of all you had missed.

555176,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B00004WGB4,Steven Hancock,"[4, 4]","Epic-length stories were nothing new to Doctor Who by the end of the sixties. William Hartnell faced his most famous foe in ""The Daleks' Master Plan,"" a twelve-part story that ran from November of 1965 to December of 1966, and would be the longest Doctor Who serial ever, until 1986 when the fourteen-part adventure ""The Trial of a Time Lord"" featured Colin Baker's last performance as the Time Lord. When the sixth season of the series came, there were two reasons to create another epic Who adventure. For one, it would see the show's 50th Serial. For the other, it would see the end of Patrick Troughton's three-year run as the Second incarnation of the Doctor. For this task, writers Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke created a behemoth adventure: the ten-part odyssey of war, aptly-titled ""The War Games.""The epic story tells of the Doctor and his companions, Jamie and Zoe, arriving on a planet where soldiers from different eras of world history have been plucked from their time periods, and forced to fight in deadly war games against their knowledge or wish. It's all the plans of the War Lord and the War Chief, who plan to create a massive army to conquer the galaxy. Although the Doctor does his best, he alone cannot thwart their plans, and has no choice but to call upon his own people, the Time Lords, for help. In so doing, he knows that he will have to face them for breaking the Time Lords' rule of non-interference.Overall, ""The War Game"" delivers on it's epic length. Recreations of epic periods of history, such as the Roman Period, the American Civil War and World War I, are done very accurately. Where the story starts to drag is when the Doctor begins to face the War Lord and War Chief, who is also a Time Lord, in their base of operations. But towards the end, the show picks up steam yet again. The serial ends with one of the most historical episodes in the show's history: the revelation of the Doctor's race, and the first trip to Gallifrey (though the planet's name is not mentioned). And finally, after three years in the role, we say goodbye to the Second Doctor, as well as his companions, as they are returned to their homes. The Doctor is then exiled to Earth by the Time Lords, and forced to regenerate yet again, ushering the end of the Patrick Troughton era of Doctor Who, and also ending the show's run in Black and White. When the show returned in 1970, it would see the beginning of the Jon Pertwee era, and the show's change to Color.The DVD presentation of ""The War Games"" is fantastic, sporting a terrific picture restoration, and crisp and clear sound. The extras are plentiful, and fascinating. Fans of Doctor Who will not want to miss this chance to own an epic-length adventure from the classic era of the series.

Although the second Doctor, Patrick Troughton, would appear in The 3 Doctors, The Five Doctors, and The Two Doctors, this serial ended the second Doctor's reign.This episode is surprisingly good, and has an unexpected ending. The show is interesting even to non-Doctor Who fans because it is well acted, it is expertly produced, and it has an intriguing story line with many surprising turns including the arrival of the Time Lords and a trial for The Doctor.Why is he on trial? The Doctor, years ago, was a bored citizen of Gallifrey the home world of the Time Lords. So being bored, he decided to steal a TARDIS or Time and Space machine. As in Star Trek, the Time Lords have a fundamental law that prohibits interference with other cultures and time lines. Time Lords are only to observe. However, the Doctor is sympathetic to those he encounters and always ends up using his power to help those in need. He is always getting involved and always getting into trouble even though he knows full well that one day he will have to answer for his actions. That day has arrived.This set is a classic and also very rare considering that most of the Patrick Troughton episodes were lost (due to colossal stupidity.) This episode, War Games, is a must have for all Doctor Who fans. All ten parts of this final episode are included in this three DVD set as well as special features making it quite a bargain.

More on this later.The plot inself is grand in scheme:  A race of aliens wishes to invade the galaxy.  With the help of a renegade Time Lord, they summarily kidnap various species.  By the time episode 1 begins, it is clear that the aliens (never named) have decided to use humanity, categorizing them as ""the most vicious species of all"". (how apt), and have already begun their final tests - brainwashing their captured humans and getting them to fight and test resourcefulness and other ""virtues"" in the least virtuous of all activities:  war.  (keep in mind, this story was written during a time when war was not glorified.  Certainly when compared to today's insane, mindless 'action hero' standards where the good guys always win without so much a drop of blood that doesn't feel painful.)The Doctor and his companions arrive in what they believe is World War 1 - you know, the war which was given the epithet ""the war to end all wars"".  (What were our forebearers of 1917 thinking, anyway?)  They soon realize strange anachronisms and feel they need to investigate further.As I said, this story does have an atmosphere that continues to pervade as the story progresses.  By the time the final episode is reached, it's difficult NOT to feel for the plights of the characters involved.  So much of an atmosphere, that by episode 8 the Doctor has to do the unthinkable and risk certain death by calling the very people he had originally fled from, the Time Lords.  The Time Lords being an immence and equally advanced race, who also don't take kindly to anybody meddling in the affairs of others.  And the Doctor has been known to violate that golden rule.Yes, the story seems padded.  But that's a bad mindset.  Watching the aventure onfold, it seems to play out in 'real time' - like a season of ""24"" only cool and filled with well played actors, which is the main reason why the show can hang together at such an otherwise ridicilous length.  (Now if episodes 1-5 could be condensed down to 2 or 3 episodes, it might then be perfect, but it's not enough to really complain about).The only problem here is with the audio.  Periodically, but not frequently enough to be a serious detriment, there are audio dropouts.  These are the fault of the master film tracks and not CBS/FOX.  Otherwise, the transfer looks very good for a VHS tape, especially given the time the tape was released (1992 or 1993)  With luck, these dropouts can be repaired or an alternate soundtrack found.",4,"Not so slow as I had remembered it to be.
