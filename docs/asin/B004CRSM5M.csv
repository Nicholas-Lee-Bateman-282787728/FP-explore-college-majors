1396312,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B004CRSM5M,Kasey G,"[24, 24]","Made available through WB Archives Manufacture-on-Demand program is this delightful mix of Christmas episodes from the Warner vaults dating back to 1961's ""Dr. Kildare"" to 1997's ""Veronica's Closet"".I got this mostly for the ""Alice"" and ""Mama's Family"" episodes, since both of those shows have only seen one DVD release each back in 2006 (Season One of ""Mama"" and a best-of single-disc of ""Alice""). The other big draw for me was the two-hour ""Eight is Enough"" episode from 1977. Here that installment is split into two parts as it was in syndication; however, it is otherwise uncut.The set also includes episodes of ""Dr. Kildare"", ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"" (guest-starring a young Jodie Foster), ""Welcome Back Kotter"", ""CHiPs"", ""Perfect Strangers"", ""Suddenly Susan"" and ""Veronica's Closet"".The picture quality on all the episodes is excellent and I was able to play the discs in my PC drive.The artwork is nice and each of the discs has a pretty snowflake pattern on it. This is just as high-quality as an official retail release. WB seems to know what they are doing with their MOD program. I have bought a dozen discs from them so far and have had no problems with any of them.A great collection of holiday episodes, and I hope this sold well so WB may next begin releasing Season Sets of ""Alice"", ""Eight is Enough"" and more ""Mama's Family"".The set seems pricey here, so I'd recommend checking WB Shop's website daily because they do have One-Day Sales and I got mine for much less.

1396315,ADBAJLF1ZJ0TB,B004CRSM5M,Mikey,"[6, 6]","I purchased this set in order to see the episode of CHiPs ""Christmas Watch"" from Christmas 1979. This would have been aired in the UK on ITV sometime during 1980 when I was five years old so I cannot remember the particular episode. The CHiPs episode is from the third series which is so far not available in full on DVD.The set has some decent episodes from other shows as listed below, some programmes which were completely new to me. Having just whizzed through the set in the last week (over Christmas 2011), it was certainly more enjoyable watching over the Christmas period.The CHiPs episode was standard CHiPs stuff, but I also enjoyed Veronica's Closet, Suddenly Susan, and Perfect Strangers. All of which were the more recent productions on the set.If you want to discover some random episodes from shows you may never have seen before, or you like a Christmas theme to some of your old favourites, then this set is for you.It might be the ideal gift for next Christmas!Episodes contained on the DVD include- The Courtship of Eddie's Father: Gifts Are For Giving 1971- Dr Kildare: An Exchange Of Gifts 1964- Welcome Back, Kotter: A Sweathog Christmas 1977- Veronica's Closet: Veronica's Christmas Song 1997- Suddenly Susan: The Walk-Out 1996- Alice: A Semi-Merry Christmas 1977- CHiPs: Christmas Watch 1979- Perfect Strangers: The Gift Of The Mypiot 1989- Eight Is Enough: Yes Nicholas, There Is A Santa Claus 1977- Mama's Family: Mama Gets Goosed 1989",4,Relive some Christmas shows from times gone by,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1461,"['purchased', 'set', 'order', 'see', 'episode', 'CHiPs', 'Christmas', 'Watch', 'Christmas', '1979', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'aired', 'UK', 'ITV', 'sometime', '1980', 'when', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'particular', 'episode', 'CHiPs', 'episode', 'third', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'available', 'full', 'DVD.The', 'set', 'decent', 'episodes', 'other', 'shows', 'listed', 'programmes', 'were', 'completely', 'new', 'Having', 'just', 'whizzed', 'set', 'last', 'week', 'Christmas', '2011', 'was', 'certainly', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'Christmas', 'period.The', 'CHiPs', 'episode', 'was', 'standard', 'CHiPs', 'stuff', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Veronica', 'Closet', 'Suddenly', 'Susan', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'All', 'were', 'more', 'recent', 'productions', 'set.If', 'want', 'discover', 'random', 'episodes', 'shows', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'Christmas', 'theme', 'old', 'favourites', 'then', 'set', 'you.It', 'might', 'be', 'ideal', 'gift', 'next', 'Christmas', 'Episodes', 'contained', 'DVD', 'include-', 'Courtship', 'Eddie', 'Father', 'Gifts', 'Are', 'Giving', '1971-', 'Dr', 'Kildare', 'Exchange', 'Gifts', '1964-', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'Sweathog', 'Christmas', '1977-', 'Veronica', 'Closet', 'Veronica', 'Christmas', 'Song', '1997-', 'Suddenly', 'Susan', 'Walk-Out', '1996-', 'Alice', 'Semi-Merry', 'Christmas', '1977-', 'CHiPs', 'Christmas', 'Watch', '1979-', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'Gift', 'Mypiot', '1989-', 'Eight', 'Enough', 'Yes', 'Nicholas', 'Santa', 'Claus', '1977-', 'Mama', 'Family', 'Mama', 'Goosed', '1989']",Classic TV Christmas Collection
