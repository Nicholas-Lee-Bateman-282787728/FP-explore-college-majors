837984,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0002JP4GE,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[4, 6]","One thing that cannot be disputed, by fans or by haters, about the series Star Trek Voyager is that it initially lacked vision. If you want to play devil's advocate, consider the possibility that the creators intended to put a Borg on the crew in exactly three years. Not very likely, eh? Nevertheless, the show still managed to put out entertaining as well as enlightening episodes early on - at least on a consistent basis. The show's fourth season is definitely good - so many of the episodes work, and it doesn't have any spectacular failures - but one could sense what was happening here. Voyager was about to become a network show, and riskier ideas were to come by the wayside in favor of more safe and more profitable ones - this was like a last huzzah. A very good huzzah, undeniably, but sad considering how the series would turn out.There are those who worshiped the show until the very end, for whatever reason, and that's fine. If it does it for you, watch it. But let's be honest here: Voyager did have a decline in quality, and although this season might not suffer, it was the reason. The network found out what it had on its hands, and the rest is history. Four good years is not a bad run.The major developments here were the embarkation of Borg goddess Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) and the romance between Tom Paris (the ever winsome Robert Duncan McNeill) and B'Elanna Torres (the also delightful Roxann Dawson). Much of the drama revolved around attempts to allow Seven to fit in with the crew, most platonic. It didn't escape Harry Kim's (Garrett Wang), nor the audience's notice that Seven seemed to have a wardrobe designed by a horny teenager. There was plenty of serious stuff: the resolution of the previous season's cliffhanger; tte-&agrave;-tte with new alien races (including a fascinating hunter race, the Hirogen); Kes' farewell; contact with home (alright, maybe `Message in a Bottle' wasn't completely serious - I guess seriocomic is a better word). There was a two-parter which put the crew in WWII France (the entertaining `Killing Game'), a visit to a `Demon' planet, and the quite good finale, `Hope and Fear', which had the crew encountering a shortcut home that, surprise, didn't quite work out, but the episode had a little more going for it than that.In short, this season was rather good, better than its successors, in any case. Fans of the older stuff, like myself, will still find it watchable, and the fans of the newer stuff will lap it up.",5,The beginning of the end,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,2485,"['One', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'disputed', 'fans', 'haters', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'initially', 'lacked', 'vision', 'want', 'play', 'devil', 'advocate', 'consider', 'possibility', 'creators', 'intended', 'put', 'Borg', 'crew', 'exactly', 'three', 'years', 'Not', 'very', 'likely', 'eh', 'Nevertheless', 'show', 'still', 'managed', 'put', 'out', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'enlightening', 'episodes', 'early', 'least', 'consistent', 'basis', 'show', 'fourth', 'season', 'definitely', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'work', ""n't"", 'have', 'spectacular', 'failures', 'one', 'could', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'here', 'Voyager', 'was', 'become', 'network', 'show', 'riskier', 'ideas', 'were', 'come', 'wayside', 'favor', 'more', 'safe', 'more', 'profitable', 'ones', 'was', 'last', 'huzzah', 'very', 'good', 'huzzah', 'undeniably', 'sad', 'considering', 'how', 'series', 'would', 'turn', 'are', 'who', 'worshiped', 'show', 'very', 'end', 'reason', 'fine', 'watch', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'Voyager', 'did', 'have', 'decline', 'quality', 'season', 'might', 'not', 'suffer', 'was', 'reason', 'network', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'hands', 'rest', 'history', 'Four', 'good', 'years', 'not', 'bad', 'run.The', 'major', 'developments', 'here', 'were', 'embarkation', 'Borg', 'goddess', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'romance', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'ever', 'winsome', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', ""B'Elanna"", 'Torres', 'also', 'delightful', 'Roxann', 'Dawson', 'Much', 'drama', 'revolved', 'around', 'attempts', 'allow', 'Seven', 'fit', 'crew', 'most', 'platonic', 'did', ""n't"", 'escape', 'Harry', 'Kim', 'Garrett', 'Wang', 'audience', 'notice', 'Seven', 'seemed', 'have', 'wardrobe', 'designed', 'horny', 'teenager', 'was', 'plenty', 'serious', 'stuff', 'resolution', 'previous', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'tte-', 'agrave', '-tte', 'new', 'alien', 'races', 'including', 'fascinating', 'hunter', 'race', 'Hirogen', 'Kes', 'farewell', 'contact', 'home', 'alright', 'maybe', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'serious', 'guess', 'seriocomic', 'better', 'word', 'was', 'two-parter', 'put', 'crew', 'WWII', 'France', 'entertaining', 'Killing', 'Game', 'visit', 'Demon', 'planet', 'quite', 'good', 'finale', 'Hope', 'Fear', 'had', 'crew', 'encountering', 'shortcut', 'home', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'episode', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'going', 'that.In', 'short', 'season', 'was', 'rather', 'good', 'better', 'successors', 'case', 'Fans', 'older', 'stuff', 'will', 'still', 'find', 'watchable', 'fans', 'newer', 'stuff', 'will', 'lap', 'up']",N/A

To be lost at sea or space has presented challenges for voyages both in the past and probable future.  As we look beyond the boundaries of earth it is nice to see how brilliant visionaries depicted how leadership would deal with these challenges.Kate Mulgrew is a very good actress and portrays Capt Janeway as a strong resourceful leader making hard decisions in difficult situations with the best interest of the crew as a guiding light.  She does this with the proper balance of command, motherhood, and humanity.  I believe I first saw her in an episode of Cheers but is much better suited for this demanding role.  She did well as did the series.  A nice break from the method acting of 'James T. Kirk' and a welcome reprieve from 'The Next Generation'.

I always thought that the premise of a ship being trapped far away and having to rely on itself to survive opened up a lot of interesting story possibilities. For me, season 4 represented a step forward in this sense. While many of the shows tended to focus on the new crew member, namely Seven of Nine, to the detriment of character development among some of the other characters, there were a number of episodes that really started to flesh out the situation of the crew. It was interesting to finally see some coverage of what it might mean to be in Borg space and deal with other races who had come across the Borg. It was also interesting to add the touch of having Starfleet finally get word that Voyager was OK in the Delta Quadrant. The relationship between Janeway and Seven and between Janeway and Chacotay was somewhat edgy which added a new dimension. At the same time, the blossoming romance between Tom Paris and BElanna Torres added a softer side. There were a couple of two-part shows that probably rank as some of the best ever in the series and a number of single episodes that touched on some interesting premises.

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[2, 2]","There is so much of consequence that happened during this year of Star Trek Voyager that....I do not entirely know when to start. Season 4 marked a very pronounced change for the show:probably the most extreme directional shift in the entire Star Trek cannon.Several major things contributed to this.For one the conclusion of the 'Scorpion' cliffhanger meant two things:that the Borg would play a far bigger role in the series from this point on,and that it served to introduce the Seven Of Nine character-a crucial element (depending on who you believe) in the shows renewed success. Another contribution to the change in Voyager this season is some major resolution in many of the characters:Tuvok got promoted,Tom Paris And B'lanna Torres finaly consumed a long jestating relationship and Janeway began altering her hairstyle. Not only that but the focus of the series in general became more fast paced and more outward focused then the emphasis on ""bottle"" episodes in the first few seasons of the show. This season is some to many of the best episodes of the series:""Revulsion"" deals with the Norman Bates of holograms and ""Year Of Hell"" may very well be one of the most broad time based stories Star Trek ever did. Many of the episodes this season dealt with Trek's sense of social commentary Star Trek did so well:""Random Thoughts"" deals with literal thought police and the ""forbidan fruit"" syndrome legality can create,""Scientific Method"" showcases the idea of unethical medical practices,""Mortal Coil"" with loss of faith,""Retrospect"" deals in an undercut way with the issue of rape while ""Living Witness"" (one of my favorites of the season) deals with the all important issue of revisionist history.Many episodes such as ""One"",""Prey"",""The Raven"" and the wonderful ""The Omega Directive"" deal with the development of the Seven of Nine Character herself-the latter dealing with ""the Borg holy grail"":omega. ""Message In A Bottle"",""Vis A Vis"" and ""Hope And Fear"" deal loosely with another issue this season bought up:Voyager making more headway in their journey to Earth. ""The Gift"" is an episode which brings to mind the main controversial element of this season:the departure of Jennifer Lien as Kes. Even after watching the bonus features on this and hearing all varrieties of gossip and such I still have no idea why the Kes character was so abruptly and unceremoniously removed from the show.That is beyond the fact the writers insisted the Kes character ""wasn't working out"". It only leaves me,along with many others to speculate. All I know is mums the word with the cast and crew of the show. I'd love to know because while I appreciate Seven Of Nine and think she contributed to Star Trek a lot in general I don't see how the character of Kes ""could'nt be salavaged"" and wished she could've remained.Despite that this is a strong season and signaled a new beginning for Voyager.",5,Voyager Getting On It's Feet,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,2891,"['so', 'much', 'consequence', 'happened', 'year', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', '.I', 'do', 'not', 'entirely', 'know', 'when', 'start', 'Season', '4', 'marked', 'very', 'pronounced', 'change', 'show', 'probably', 'most', 'extreme', 'directional', 'shift', 'entire', 'Star', 'Trek', 'cannon.Several', 'major', 'things', 'contributed', 'this.For', 'one', 'conclusion', ""'Scorpion"", 'cliffhanger', 'meant', 'two', 'things', 'Borg', 'would', 'play', 'far', 'bigger', 'role', 'series', 'point', 'served', 'introduce', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'character-a', 'crucial', 'element', 'depending', 'who', 'believe', 'shows', 'renewed', 'success', 'contribution', 'change', 'Voyager', 'season', 'major', 'resolution', 'many', 'characters', 'Tuvok', 'got', 'promoted', 'Tom', 'Paris', ""B'lanna"", 'Torres', 'consumed', 'long', 'jestating', 'relationship', 'Janeway', 'began', 'altering', 'hairstyle', 'Not', 'only', 'focus', 'series', 'general', 'became', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'more', 'outward', 'focused', 'then', 'emphasis', 'bottle', 'episodes', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'show', 'season', 'many', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'Revulsion', 'deals', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'holograms', 'Year', 'Hell', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'broad', 'time', 'based', 'stories', 'Star', 'Trek', 'ever', 'did', 'Many', 'episodes', 'season', 'dealt', 'Trek', 'sense', 'social', 'commentary', 'Star', 'Trek', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'Random', 'Thoughts', 'deals', 'literal', 'thought', 'police', 'forbidan', 'fruit', 'syndrome', 'legality', 'can', 'create', 'Scientific', 'Method', 'idea', 'unethical', 'medical', 'practices', 'Mortal', 'Coil', 'loss', 'faith', 'Retrospect', 'deals', 'undercut', 'way', 'issue', 'rape', 'Living', 'Witness', 'one', 'favorites', 'season', 'deals', 'important', 'issue', 'revisionist', 'history.Many', 'episodes', 'such', 'One', 'Prey', 'Raven', 'wonderful', 'Omega', 'Directive', 'deal', 'development', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'Character', 'herself-the', 'latter', 'dealing', 'Borg', 'holy', 'grail', 'omega', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'Vis', 'Hope', 'Fear', 'deal', 'loosely', 'issue', 'season', 'bought', 'up', 'Voyager', 'making', 'more', 'headway', 'journey', 'Earth', 'Gift', 'episode', 'mind', 'main', 'controversial', 'element', 'season', 'departure', 'Jennifer', 'Lien', 'Kes', 'Even', 'watching', 'bonus', 'hearing', 'varrieties', 'gossip', 'such', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Kes', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'abruptly', 'unceremoniously', 'removed', 'show.That', 'fact', 'writers', 'insisted', 'Kes', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'out', 'only', 'many', 'others', 'speculate', 'know', 'word', 'cast', 'crew', 'show', ""'d"", 'love', 'know', 'appreciate', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'think', 'contributed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'lot', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'character', 'Kes', ""could'nt"", 'be', 'salavaged', 'wished', 'could', ""'ve"", 'remained.Despite', 'strong', 'season', 'signaled', 'new', 'beginning', 'Voyager']",N/A

The Star Trek franchise was starting to thin out by that time, with everyone, including me, jumping off before 'Enterprise' was rolled out.  Voyager took a real risk; they hired the lead actress on the recommendation of the actor who play Q, a good friend of Kate Mulgrew.  Many trek fans, like my brothers, just couldn't accept a woman in the lead.  That is too bad, because she was a fine actress. In this season, the series has risen above its shaky first two seasons.  The first few seasons of the more respected Next Generation were also very suspect, so this is no large criticism.  The key addition to this Voyager series was the actress portrayng seven of nine.  She is not a large part of this year; her roles come later.  The writing for her roles was as fine and nuanced as any sci fi writing anywhere.

837998,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B0002JP4GE,Brandon J. Smith,"[1, 1]","The fourth season of Voyager is the first truly great season of the show. Upon rewatching the series, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the first three seasons held up. My memories were of a rather poor show that miraculously improved halfway through its run. What I found, though, was that the first seasons were not bad, but they were uneven. Many good episodes, a few great ones, and a handful of terrible ones. Rewatching the series revealed that the show had promise but took a while to reach the level it was capable of. In their fourth season, though, they fulfilled that promise.Subtracting Kes, whose character arc had become unfocused, and adding Seven of Nine turned out to be a masterstroke. Yes, Seven brought a more blatant sex appeal than Kes, but she also brought a new perspective to the show and new possibilities. Her character was like a shot in the arm to the series, and the quality of the writing improved as well (as did Captain Janeway's hairstyle). Thrilling two-parters like ""The Year of Hell,"" personal crises as in ""Mortal Coil,"" and emotionally charged moments as in the closing scene of ""Message in a Bottle"" add up to a remarkable, wonderful season.Voyager was a great show, and this season is the first to really prove it, from start to finish.",5,Voyager Reaches New Heights,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,1282,"['fourth', 'season', 'Voyager', 'first', 'truly', 'great', 'season', 'show', 'rewatching', 'series', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'held', 'up', 'memories', 'were', 'rather', 'poor', 'show', 'miraculously', 'improved', 'halfway', 'run', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'first', 'seasons', 'were', 'not', 'bad', 'were', 'uneven', 'Many', 'good', 'episodes', 'few', 'great', 'ones', 'handful', 'terrible', 'ones', 'Rewatching', 'series', 'revealed', 'show', 'had', 'promise', 'took', 'while', 'reach', 'level', 'was', 'capable', 'fourth', 'season', 'though', 'fulfilled', 'promise.Subtracting', 'Kes', 'character', 'arc', 'had', 'become', 'unfocused', 'adding', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'masterstroke', 'Yes', 'Seven', 'brought', 'more', 'blatant', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Kes', 'also', 'brought', 'new', 'perspective', 'show', 'new', 'possibilities', 'character', 'was', 'shot', 'arm', 'series', 'quality', 'writing', 'improved', 'well', 'did', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'hairstyle', 'Thrilling', 'two-parters', 'Year', 'Hell', 'personal', 'crises', 'Mortal', 'Coil', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'moments', 'closing', 'scene', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'add', 'up', 'remarkable', 'wonderful', 'season.Voyager', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'season', 'first', 'really', 'prove', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Scorpion: Part 2"" in which the crew aboard the Voyager devise a solution to the Borg's problem. But before they reveal their secret, they ask for an agreement granting safe passage for the ship and its crew, prompting the Borg to send a drone ambassador as a representative in the negotiations... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Random Thoughts"" in which the Voyager crew visits a planet inhabited by telepathic beings who have outlawed all thoughts of violence (and one of the Voyager crew is arrested for having such thoughts), and ""The Omega Directive"" in which the Voyager encounters a dangerous space-obliterating particle named Omega that Starfleet Captains are ordered to destroy...Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek: Voyager (Season 4) DVD:Episode 69 (Scorpion: Part 2)Episode 70 (The Gift)Episode 71 (Day of Honor)Episode 72 (Nemesis)Episode 73

838011,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B0002JP4GE,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[10, 40]","During Voyager's hiatus, rumors circulated that Jennifer Lien was being let go, two years before her contract was up. The official story was the writers were having difficulty nailing Kes' character down, plus they seemed inhibited by her nine-year life cycle. Unofficially, her departure was due to adding on a new character. Like Michael Dorn, who was brought in to bring up DS9's ratings, they hired Jeri Ryan, late of NBC's very little seen Dark Skies, to play a female Borg to be rescued by Janeway. Getting rid of Kes was the less of many evils. Since the series had begun, she was one of the most consistently underused characters, and was becoming Voyager's version of Troi from TNG -either missing from episodes altogether or there, but with only a few lines. Jeri Ryan is a very beautiful, full figured woman. And put into a clingy cat suit, she would be the eye candy for the 18-35 year old males, one of the most sought after groups by advertisers. Rating were bound to go up, was the theory. Plus, Seven would now take over for B'Elanna's role as the daughter to the Janeway as mother analogy. And for a bit, the ratings were in an upswing. But the more things change, as the saying goes, the more it remains the same. The stories continued to be problematic. Some stories had good ideas like Day of Honor, Nemesis and Revulsion, but were executed in the silliest way. In particular, Revulsion, while a good concept and exceptional performances from Dawson and Picardo and guest star Leland Orser, but you had to be a complete idiot not to guess that Orser's character was loopy. It's this stuff; this meaningless that angered many fans. Year of Hell, perhaps, was the highlight of the season, a complex two-parter that had the crew up against a real threat, though as the show unfolds, you really discover that the character of Annorax is not evil. Like the Vidiians, his only crime is what he does in the undertaking of his goal. With both the Vidiians and the Kazon now 10 years behind them (see The Gift) and Species 8472 temporarily not around, a new enemy was introduced. The Hirogen were quietly introduced in Message in a Bottle, after Seven discovers a network of relay stations that lead to the Alpha Quadrant (and who built them is never really explained, as it certainly was not the Hirogen). The Doctor spends sometime on the Prometheus, an experimental Starfleet ship taken over by the Romulans. It was a witty script and it gave the Doctor a chance to tell Starfleet of their situation, thusly ensuing they would begin thinking of ways to save the stranded starship (its called foreshadowing, kids). Meanwhile, the Hirogen were barley seen in the next episode called Hunters, though with a title like that you kind of expected too, but they became the B story, as the main focus of the episode appeared to be reactions to the letters the crew was getting. Prey was next, and we learn more about them. They are a species that hunts other intelligent species for their skulls. They have no homeworld, with their entire culture based on the hunt. They would pop up again a few episodes later, in the uneven two-parter, The Killing Game. Somehow, though it never is clearly explained, they have taken over Voyager and are using the crew on the holodecks. The Hirogen's have chosen World War II scenario as they try to figure out the humans (though you would think the Borg attack at Wolfe 359 would be a better choice). In the end, it is discovered that the Alpha Hirogen fears that they have spread themselves to thin, and if they don't learn to adapt to new aliens, they will be defeated. And while the story is pure escapism, it also features one of Janeway's and the series, greatest blunders. After all is resolved, she actually gives the Hirogen's holodeck technology. This was just another blatant misuse of the Prime Directive to fit the plot. Further evidence that under Braga's leadership, Trek was becoming his show, filled with his ideas and be damned continuity and logic.

At first, I feared this was just a move to drop a blonde bombshell onto the show to boost ratings. That of course was probably part of the producers' motivation.However, Jeri Ryan brought a lot more to the show. She's a very talented actress and Seven of Nine, the former Borg drone, is a tough role. Yet, Jeri delivers her lines with a wonderful deadpan. I find myself enjoying episodes featuring her (or the Doctor) more than the usual fare. It's no wonder that, starting with Season 4, Star Trek Voyager became known as the Seven of Nine show.That said, Seven's presence so outshines the rest of the crew that it risked undermining the ensemble nature of Star Trek. For Season 4, the focus on Seven makes sense, but the other characters got left behind.Season 4 also began Voyager's focus on action. Parts of this worked well.

Next, the aliens they encounter almost all have the same juvenile appearance: obviously human, with a ridge running from forehead to tip of nose, or some sort of pencil size holes in their foreheads with short prongs protruding from them. The producers could have spent a little more money on this, or just left them plain old human.

The cast seemed wooden, unattractive, and uninteresting and Captain Janeway seemed very anal retentive in regards to keeping to Starfleet protocol on her lost ship despite being over 50 years away from home.  After the second season, I only watched this series intermittently despite being a die-hard Trekkie.  In the Fall preview for the fourth season they showed a new cast member, Seven of Nine, who would be played by Jeri Ryan.This blonde beauty was was so gorgeous and regal in the previews (like Grace Kelly), Ms. Ryan made me tune back into ST:V after a one year hiatus.  After Jeri Lynn was cast on STV, I didn't miss an episode. Jeri Ryan portrays Seven of Nine, as a strong, super smart, arrogant, but an emotionally stunted human because she was a Borg since the age of six. Seven of Nine was once upon a time, Annika Hansen, the young daughter of two brilliant scientist, who was kidnapped and assimilated by the Borg as a young child and now has to learn what it is to be human again when Janeway severes her from the Bord Collective. Just looking at Jeri Ryan portraying Seven of Nine makes me believe there is a God and I am not exaggerating.  I loved every episode where Ms. Ryan's character, Seven of Nine, was featured.  She made Star Trek interesting and fun to to watch again and only regret that they tried to make her character so conventional as the series went on. Specifically, I really enjoyed the lesbian subtext between Kathryn Janeway and Seven of Nine and only wish the producers would could have taken advantage of the natural and intense chemistry between Jeri Ryan and Kate Mulgrew and created something really alien and subversive, namely a lesbian romance ...

838032,ABSHD5PC5YEH6,B0002JP4GE,"J. M Quiggins ""Sole_Fish""","[10, 18]","I am sure i will not be popular for this. But, this is how i see it. I must preface this with the point that i am a fan of Voyager. And, many true fans may not want to admit my points. Season one was a struggling effort at best. But, the promise did shine through. Season 2 brought us much closer to the crew as a whole. Neelix , Tes , Tom, Chakotay , Janeway, Tuvok , Kim and all the others were being fleshed out wonderfully. Season 3 took the holographic doc out of the sick bay and into a true and quite personal relationship with the crew. Not to mention the 'deceitfulness' of Tom Paris throughout most of an entire season. Playing a malcontent in the most passionate way. And, they did not let us in on the trick until very late in the season. As a viewer, you just had to wonder if he was going to mount a mutiny. All of the events in season 2 and 3 led us deeper into our 'relationships' with each crewmember in a way i have not known in Star Trek. With the exception,of course, of The Next Generation crew. And, then, in a fight for better ratings on a failing network, they add '7 OF 9'. The show changed dramatically. It became wrapped almost entirely around her. And her main focus? She never liked anything the captain had to say. She gave no respect to Janeway. She constantly disobeyed orders. After a while, you had to wonder why Janeway didn't transport her out into open space. She had no respect for anyone else for that matter. A constant complainer that was was nothing short of irritating. Looks aside, she should not have taken over the show that much. Each character is so precise ,complex and open to ideas that could have been explored in season 4. It's a shame that they all became a backdrop for an amazon blonde (no offense to AMAZON.COM!)  At that point the show began to lose its' focus. Dropping into campiness in such a way that i caught myself snorting in contempt at their efforts. The ridiculous 'Hunters' that only proved themselves to be big bullies and crybabies when voyager used their array to contact a federation ship 60,000 light years away. Sure, in a later episode they proved themselves to be somewhat worthy opponents, albiet still the 'bully' type by their approach. 8 ships on Voyager at one time. But, in this episode, they stomped their collective feet and did not prove any more threat to the crew or their ship than a single solitary tribble. ""You can't use our array"". Oh, boo hoo. And, then, that same episode dug down into an effort to give the crew ""Letters from home"" to cheer them up. What a depressing episode. Letters concerning whole races wiped out. Janeways husband left her for dead and remarried. Poor Tom Paris didn't even get his letter from family or friends. And, our ever-present Klingon gave him this advice ""Just pretend it was 'good' news."" Tom said ""O.K., i will."" and went back to work. End of episode. Credits roll. What a letdown. Even the openning show of the season, which was a cliffhanger from a powerful show at the end of season 3, left a lot to be desired. A selfish man with the power to wipe out civilizations accidentally wipes out his family. So, he cavorts through time destroying other civilizations with the hopes that he may get his wife back. Hundreds of years of destroying lives and erasing history. Sounds like there should be a grand finale, right? Regretfully, there was not. There are still some glimmers of hope left in season 4 that will guide you into the 'FAR' superior season 5. Once the writers, directors and such began tiring of showing '7 OF 9's' bosoms constantly, the show began to reconstruct back into the show that the majority of fans truly admired. For any fan, every season is a must own. But, this season gave us a show that was nearing an early withdrawal from the airwaves. They just lost their quality control. They thought a sexy blonde (and she WAS sexy) could beef up the ratings. But that reasoning failed. They lost quite a few dedicated viewers and never fully recovered. Suffice it to say, the show was nearly 'assimilated' by the neilson ratings.",3,An attempt to fix what was not broken.,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,4077,"['am', 'sure', 'i', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'popular', 'how', 'i', 'see', 'must', 'preface', 'point', 'am', 'fan', 'Voyager', 'many', 'true', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'admit', 'points', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'struggling', 'effort', 'best', 'promise', 'did', 'shine', 'Season', '2', 'brought', 'much', 'closer', 'crew', 'whole', 'Neelix', 'Tes', 'Tom', 'Chakotay', 'Janeway', 'Tuvok', 'Kim', 'others', 'were', 'being', 'fleshed', 'out', 'wonderfully', 'Season', '3', 'took', 'holographic', 'doc', 'sick', 'bay', 'true', 'quite', 'personal', 'relationship', 'crew', 'Not', 'mention', ""'deceitfulness"", 'Tom', 'Paris', 'most', 'entire', 'season', 'Playing', 'malcontent', 'most', 'passionate', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'trick', 'very', 'late', 'season', 'viewer', 'just', 'had', 'wonder', 'was', 'going', 'mount', 'mutiny', 'events', 'season', '2', '3', 'led', 'deeper', ""'relationships"", 'crewmember', 'way', 'i', 'have', 'not', 'known', 'Star', 'Trek', 'exception', 'course', 'Next', 'Generation', 'crew', 'then', 'fight', 'better', 'ratings', 'failing', 'network', 'add', '7', '9', 'show', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'became', 'wrapped', 'almost', 'entirely', 'main', 'focus', 'never', 'liked', 'anything', 'captain', 'had', 'say', 'gave', 'respect', 'Janeway', 'constantly', 'disobeyed', 'orders', 'while', 'had', 'wonder', 'why', 'Janeway', 'did', ""n't"", 'transport', 'out', 'open', 'space', 'had', 'respect', 'anyone', 'else', 'matter', 'constant', 'complainer', 'was', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'irritating', 'Looks', 'aside', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'show', 'much', 'character', 'so', 'precise', 'complex', 'open', 'ideas', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'season', '4', 'shame', 'became', 'backdrop', 'amazon', 'blonde', 'offense', 'AMAZON.COM', 'point', 'show', 'began', 'lose', 'focus', 'Dropping', 'campiness', 'such', 'way', 'i', 'caught', 'snorting', 'contempt', 'efforts', 'ridiculous', ""'Hunters"", 'only', 'proved', 'be', 'big', 'bullies', 'crybabies', 'when', 'voyager', 'used', 'array', 'contact', 'federation', 'ship', '60,000', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'Sure', 'later', 'episode', 'proved', 'be', 'somewhat', 'worthy', 'opponents', 'albiet', 'still', ""'bully"", 'type', 'approach', '8', 'ships', 'Voyager', 'one', 'time', 'episode', 'stomped', 'collective', 'feet', 'did', 'not', 'prove', 'more', 'threat', 'crew', 'ship', 'single', 'solitary', 'tribble', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'array', 'Oh', 'boo', 'hoo', 'then', 'same', 'episode', 'dug', 'down', 'effort', 'give', 'crew', 'Letters', 'home', 'cheer', 'up', 'What', 'depressing', 'episode', 'Letters', 'concerning', 'whole', 'races', 'wiped', 'out', 'Janeways', 'husband', 'left', 'dead', 'remarried', 'Poor', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'letter', 'family', 'friends', 'ever-present', 'Klingon', 'gave', 'advice', 'Just', 'pretend', 'was', ""'good"", 'news', 'Tom', 'said', 'O.K.', 'i', 'will', 'went', 'back', 'work', 'End', 'episode', 'Credits', 'roll', 'What', 'letdown', 'Even', 'openning', 'show', 'season', 'was', 'cliffhanger', 'powerful', 'show', 'end', 'season', '3', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'selfish', 'man', 'power', 'wipe', 'out', 'civilizations', 'accidentally', 'out', 'family', 'So', 'time', 'destroying', 'other', 'civilizations', 'hopes', 'may', 'get', 'wife', 'back', 'Hundreds', 'years', 'destroying', 'lives', 'erasing', 'history', 'should', 'be', 'grand', 'finale', 'right', 'Regretfully', 'was', 'not', 'are', 'still', 'glimmers', 'hope', 'left', 'season', '4', 'will', 'guide', ""'FAR"", 'superior', 'season', '5', 'Once', 'writers', 'directors', 'such', 'began', 'tiring', 'showing', '7', '9', 'bosoms', 'constantly', 'show', 'began', 'reconstruct', 'back', 'show', 'majority', 'fans', 'truly', 'admired', 'fan', 'season', 'must', 'own', 'season', 'gave', 'show', 'was', 'nearing', 'early', 'withdrawal', 'airwaves', 'just', 'lost', 'quality', 'control', 'thought', 'sexy', 'blonde', 'WAS', 'sexy', 'could', 'beef', 'up', 'ratings', 'reasoning', 'failed', 'lost', 'quite', 'few', 'dedicated', 'viewers', 'never', 'fully', 'recovered', 'Suffice', 'say', 'show', 'was', 'nearly', ""'assimilated"", 'neilson', 'ratings']",N/A

838035,A3J3NGEIHCAT4E,B0002JP4GE,Joseph Arnold,"[0, 0]","Season Four is by far the best one so far and that is because of several main events and even some minor items. Here are the main events:The Addition Of The Character Seven of Nine: Seven of Nine is a female Borg drone who came to the series in the episode Scorpion Part II. Seven of Nine was assimilated into the Borg collective at the age of six so that's all she knows. In the mentioned episode Seven of Nine was among several Borg drones who came aboard Voyager as a result of an alliance to fight a common enemy-Species 8472. It became apparent to Commander Chakotay, who was in command when Captain Janeway was incapacitated due to an injury, that the Borg drones was working against Voyager. With that he ordered an airlock opened which sent the Borg drones into space. Seven of Nine managed not to get sent out into space. In time her link to the collective would get severed forcing her to deal with becoming an individual apart from the Borg collective. The remainder of the season and the series has her working on her regaining her humanity as well as working as a Voyager crewmember. Seven of Nine is to Voyager what Mr. Spock was to the orginal series and what Data was to Star Trek The Next GenerationKes Departs: In the episode The Gift Kes will depart. She does this because her telepathic powers was growing and it got to a point where her being on Voyager was endangering the ship and crew. So she would leave Voyager but she would use her power to move Voyager some 10,000 light years closer to the Alpha Quadrant. This brings Voyager 10 years closer to home.Voyager Makes Contact With Starfleet: In the episode Message In A Bottle Seven of Nine is able to detect a Starfleet vessle in the Alpha Quadrant through a network of alien relay stations. Attempts to contact the ship fail. So the doctors program is sent. The doctor makes it to the vessle only to find that it had been taken over by Romulans. The doctor along with that ships EMH would retake the ship. With that the Doctor would pass on to Starfleet Voyager's status and whereabouts. The episode ends with Captain Janeway stating that now 60,000 light years doesn't seem so far. Other episodes do have Voyager and Voyager crew in contact with Starfleet officials and family members.I do want to mention a character who is up and coming: Naomi Wildman. She was born during Season One and she is mixed race: human/ktarian. The latter race grows and matures sooner and faster than humans. With that she has grown and she is seen in several episodes. She is a sweetheart. She is seen interacting with the crew in her play and with the serious part of her schooling. In one episode she spends time with Seven of Nine where Seven of Nine helps Naomi with her learning and Naomi teaches Seven of Nine how to play a game. Naomi will eventually have a position on Voyager: Captains Assistant.It would take me time to watch all the episodes but watch the I did. The discs played with no problem and I did get the item at a good price. It was on sale. This season however does not end with a two part cliffhanger like the past three seasons. Also I must add that I would have the item in a timely manner. Like all my other orders I used the no cost Super Saver shipping.

838036,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B0002JP4GE,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","A mostly solid batch of ""Voyager"" episodes, bolstered by the addition of ex-Borg ""Seven of Nine"" to the show's roster of characters.  In the special features (always quite varied and generous in these Trek boxed sets), it's fun to watch the producers tell us with a straight face that Seven's sex appeal factor had little to do with what they were trying to accomplish when they created the character.  Then you see the, uh... extremely fit Jeri Ryan in her Seven of Nine jumpsuit and say, ""yeah, right"".  But, still, Seven IS an intriguing character- kind of a mix of Spock (holds science and logic in high esteem) and Data (is fascinated with the ways of humanity)- and she brings a lot to these episodes.If you were lukewarm towards ""Voyager"" during its original run, you might want to give the series another try on DVD (but start at the beginning).  Like most TV, the show really plays much better without all the commercials.  I can understand if you want to wait until the price drops a little, however.  Individual season-long sets of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" are still priced fairly high.April 2008 postscript:  Paramount has drastically dropped the prices of all its ""Trek"" DVD sets.

838037,A1D7VWS3DWS7X8,B0002JP4GE,Joseph Siegler,"[42, 44]","I love Star Trek, I have since it was first on in the 60's (my dad tells me I used to watch it in my playpen in 1966 when I was only a year old!).  :)  Anyway, I consider myself a pretty good Star Trek fan, I've been watching as long as I can remember.Voyager never quite did it for me when it was new.  I think part of the reason was that they removed themselves from the established Star Trek continuity.  You didn't have all the familiar sights of the Federation and whatnot.  However, over time, the show has grown on me, even moreso since it went off the air.  I have several Star Trek season sets, but I don't buy all of them, mostly because of the price of the things, and the fact that I won't rewatch them a zillion times, the cost kind of keeps me from buying all of them.Having said that, I felt that Season 4 was a must buy.  The reason was the introduction of Seven of Nine.  Her visual look aside, I felt Seven was a pretty complex character, and while Seven based stories seemed to dominate for awhile, I felt she was a good mix to the crew.  The fact that Jeri Ryan was pleasing (a little TOO pleasing for some people) to the eye kind of made it difficult for some people to look past her breasts and see the good character there.  A Borg as a crewmember?  That was a pretty radical concept back when this was new.  None of the fans really knew how it would turn out.  It turned out pretty well, and in Season 4 you can see the genesis of the character.Also, we lost Kes this season.  The production staff was on record saying that they didn't know what to do with the character.  Personally, I thought the character was fine.  There were some wonderful Kes stories in the first three years of the show, and I liked that Kes was a character that didn't have these hidden agendas, didn't want to have a command of her own, etc..  She was just a ""nice"" character.  And that was lost.  Shame, as I thought Jennifer Lien was both cute and pulled off what they did try to do pretty well.There's several REALLY good stories in Season 4.  Obviously, the introuction of Seven in the first episode is great (that's one beef I have with these seasons sets; season ending cliffhangers are spread over two sets, and you don't get part 1 of this thing).  Ones I liked a lot were ""The Gift"" (The departure of Kes), The Year of Hell Pts 1/2 (The crew evacuates Voyager and it takes some supreme beatings), Message in a Bottle (The Doctor is transported back to the Alpha Quadrant), The Killing Game Pts 1/2 (The crew is forced to play war games on the Holodeck), Living Witness (a fabulous story where the crew is depicted 700 years in the future in a soceity's museum; depicted wrong).  Hope and Fear (Starfleet sends a ship to bring Voyager home?).There's plenty more good stuff in this season, but I don't want to just sit here and list them all.  There's a good episode guide over at startrek.com for all these episodes, go check it out.I gave this review 4 stars out of 5 because of the fact that I don't much care for what Paramount has done with the extras on these sets.  They need commentaries, they need deleted scenes, they need a whole lot more stuff than the few flimsy documentaries they have included.  I'm also not a fan of the actual packaging used on the Voyager sets, it seems pretty ""cheap"" to me.  The episodes are great, so that's where the high mark comes from, but I'm disappointed in Paramount for dropping the ball on creating what could be really GREAT season sets; they seem content on just doing some work on them.  What concerns me more is Paramount's history of releasing minimal releases, and then later on re-releasing them with far more extensive versions.  They did that with all the Star Trek movies, I sure hope they aren't planning the same wiht the various TV show sets.",4,"Pretty decent, solid season of Voyager",1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,3810,"['love', 'Star', 'Trek', 'have', 'was', 'first', '60', 'dad', 'used', 'watch', 'playpen', '1966', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'year', 'old', 'Anyway', 'consider', 'pretty', 'good', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember.Voyager', 'never', 'quite', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'think', 'part', 'reason', 'was', 'removed', 'established', 'Star', 'Trek', 'continuity', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'familiar', 'sights', 'Federation', 'whatnot', 'However', 'time', 'show', 'grown', 'even', 'moreso', 'went', 'air', 'have', 'several', 'Star', 'Trek', 'season', 'sets', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'mostly', 'price', 'things', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rewatch', 'zillion', 'times', 'cost', 'kind', 'keeps', 'buying', 'them.Having', 'said', 'felt', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'must', 'buy', 'reason', 'was', 'introduction', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'visual', 'look', 'aside', 'felt', 'Seven', 'was', 'pretty', 'complex', 'character', 'Seven', 'based', 'stories', 'seemed', 'dominate', 'awhile', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'mix', 'crew', 'fact', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'was', 'pleasing', 'little', 'TOO', 'pleasing', 'people', 'eye', 'kind', 'made', 'difficult', 'people', 'look', 'breasts', 'see', 'good', 'character', 'there', 'Borg', 'crewmember', 'was', 'pretty', 'radical', 'concept', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'None', 'fans', 'really', 'knew', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'turned', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'Season', '4', 'can', 'see', 'genesis', 'character.Also', 'lost', 'Kes', 'season', 'production', 'staff', 'was', 'record', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'character', 'Personally', 'thought', 'character', 'was', 'fine', 'were', 'wonderful', 'Kes', 'stories', 'first', 'three', 'years', 'show', 'liked', 'Kes', 'was', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'hidden', 'agendas', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'command', 'own', 'etc..', 'was', 'just', 'nice', 'character', 'was', 'lost', 'Shame', 'thought', 'Jennifer', 'Lien', 'was', 'cute', 'pulled', 'off', 'what', 'did', 'try', 'do', 'pretty', 'well.There', 'several', 'REALLY', 'good', 'stories', 'Season', '4', 'Obviously', 'introuction', 'Seven', 'first', 'episode', 'great', 'one', 'beef', 'have', 'seasons', 'sets', 'season', 'ending', 'cliffhangers', 'are', 'spread', 'two', 'sets', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'part', '1', 'thing', 'liked', 'lot', 'were', 'Gift', 'departure', 'Kes', 'Year', 'Hell', 'Pts', '1/2', 'crew', 'Voyager', 'supreme', 'beatings', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'Doctor', 'transported', 'back', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'Killing', 'Game', 'Pts', '1/2', 'crew', 'forced', 'play', 'war', 'games', 'Holodeck', 'Living', 'Witness', 'fabulous', 'story', 'where', 'crew', 'depicted', '700', 'years', 'future', 'soceity', 'museum', 'depicted', 'wrong', 'Hope', 'Fear', 'Starfleet', 'ship', 'bring', 'Voyager', 'home', 'plenty', 'more', 'good', 'stuff', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'just', 'sit', 'here', 'list', 'good', 'episode', 'guide', 'startrek.com', 'episodes', 'go', 'check', 'out.I', 'gave', 'review', '4', 'stars', '5', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'what', 'Paramount', 'done', 'extras', 'sets', 'need', 'commentaries', 'need', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'need', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'stuff', 'few', 'flimsy', 'documentaries', 'have', 'included', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'fan', 'actual', 'packaging', 'used', 'Voyager', 'sets', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'where', 'high', 'mark', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'Paramount', 'dropping', 'ball', 'creating', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'GREAT', 'season', 'sets', 'seem', 'content', 'just', 'doing', 'work', 'What', 'more', 'Paramount', 'history', 'releasing', 'minimal', 'releases', 'then', 'later', 're-releasing', 'far', 'more', 'extensive', 'versions', 'did', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'sure', 'hope', 'are', ""n't"", 'planning', 'same', 'various', 'TV', 'show', 'sets']",N/A

The Borg have started a war with a species called 8472 from fluid space. They can't handle the species 8472 because none of them have been assimilated due in part to their complex DNA. Kes telepathically recieves messages form 8472 saying that they must kill everything in this Galaxy. Janeway takes them for a more powerful threat than the Borg. Through assualt on Harrry Kim by 8472 after they baord a crippled Borg vessal a sample of Dna from 8472 is used to create a weapon against 8472. Janeway convinces the Borg to let her go through Borg space as they develope the weapon against 8472. This decision does sort of come back to haunt her later on. The Borg aboard Voyager take over the ship when weapon is finished and go to fluid space and Voyager destroys some of 8472's ships and the war between them and the Borg is over for now. Janeway manages to jettison all of the Borg except seven of nine( a human but asilmated at an early age). Seven has great diffculty going back to being a human because assimilation was at such an early stage.She progresses slowly throughout this season.

The plan was plain as day; get rid of Kes as fast as possible and get a sexy female in there; TNG had Deanna Troi, DS9 had Jadzia Dax and Kira Nerys, what did Voyager have?  Torres had the sexiness of a Bat'leth and Kes was functionally a child; enter Seven of Nine, who was clearly designed to give male fans something to look at to try and spike ratings.I'd actually be okay with this if not for the persistence of the Seven of Nine humanity episodes throughout the season.

838053,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0002JP4GE,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[9, 10]","Less than one year following the concluding season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the ""Star Trek"" universe originally created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled ""Voyager"" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May, 2001. Because ""Voyager"" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season. The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.Unlike the previous three ""Star Trek"" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy. Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth. Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.The primary cast members of the fourth season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Delta Quadrant native (Ocampan) Kes (Jennifer Lien, first two episodes only), Lt. Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ), Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and the former Borg drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Voyager's fourth season begins with the second part (episode ""Scorpion, Part 2"") to the third season's cliffhanger about Voyager making an agreement with the Borg to aid in their war against the seemingly unstoppable species 8472.With the departure of Kes in the second episode (""The Gift""), the fourth season of ""Voyager"" focuses much attention upon its newest crewmember, Seven of Nine, whom Captain Janeway chose to cut off from the Borg Collective at the end of episode ""Scorpion, Part 2"".  She begins to relearn what it means to be human primarily from Captain Janeway, but also from the holographic doctor.  Other stories during the fourth season include B'Elanna and her ongoing struggles with her Klingon half, a change in the relationship between Paris and B'Elanna, Cmdr. Chakotay becomes involved in an interspecies war in episode ""Nemesis"", the doctor encounters a psychopathic hologram (Leland Orser) in episode ""Revulsion"", the crew discovers the source of many physical problems afflicting the crew in episode ""Scientific Method"", Captain Janeway continues to enjoy time in the holodeck with Leonardo Da Vinci, Voyager's encounters the hunting Hirogen and Voyager encounters the most dangerous substance known to the Federation in episode ""The Omega Directive"". The best fourth-season episodes, in order of airdate, include ""Scorpion, Part 2"", ""The Gift"", ""Day of Honor"", ""Nemesis"", ""Revulsion"", ""The Raven"", ""Scientific Method"", ""Year of Hell, Part 1 & 2"", ""Concerning Flight"", ""Waking Moments"", ""Message in a Bottle"", ""Prey"", ""The Omega Directive"", ""One"" and ""Hope and Fear"".Overall, I rate the fourth season of ""Voyager"" with 4.5 out of 5 stars, rounded to 5 stars. Thankfully, the Kazon are no longer around, but the Hirogen become slightly annoying and predictable over time.  Though many ""Voyager"" fans regretted the loss of character Kes, the development of Seven of Nine's character was very good and only continued to get better in the succeeding seasons, as well as the further story development of the Borg collective itself.",5,"Kes Evolves Into Something Powerful, Seven of Nine Stays",1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,4377,"['Less', 'one', 'year', 'following', 'concluding', 'season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', '1994', 'executive', 'producer/writer', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'Michael', 'Piller', 'Jeri', 'Taylor', 'created', 'fourth', 'television', 'series', 'based', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'originally', 'created', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', '1921-1991', '1960', 'fourth', 'television', 'series', 'entitled', 'Voyager', 'name', 'Federation', 'Planets', 'starship', 'used', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'January', '1995', 'ran', 'seven', 'seasons', 'concluded', 'May', '2001', 'Voyager', 'aired', 'initially', 'month', 'January', 'instead', 'traditional', 'September', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'first', 'season', 'succeeding', 'six', 'other', 'seasons', 'had', '26', 'episodes', 'grand', 'total', '172', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series.Unlike', 'previous', 'three', 'Star', 'Trek', 'television', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'took', 'place', 'bounds', 'Federation', 'Planets', 'nearby', 'sovereign', 'areas', 'space', 'such', 'Klingon', 'Empire', 'Romulan', 'Empire', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'starship', 'Voyager', 'hurled', 'tens', 'thousands', 'light-years', 'home', 'previously', 'unknown', 'unexplored', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'located', 'far', 'side', 'Milky', 'Way', 'Galaxy', 'Even', 'traveling', 'warp', '8', 'fastest', 'safe', 'speed', 'typical', 'starship', 'can', 'travel', 'would', 'take', 'Voyager', 'several', 'decades', 'return', 'Earth', 'Hence', 'series', 'survival', 'Voyager', 'Starfleet', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'isolated', 'unable', 'even', 'maintain', 'normal', 'communications', 'Earth', 'as', 'well', 'crew', 'ultimate', 'desire', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'faster', 'ship', 'capable', 'doing', 'Also', 'way', 'Voyager', 'few', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'natives.The', 'primary', 'cast', 'members', 'fourth', 'season', 'Voyager', 'include', 'Captain', 'Catherine', 'Janeway', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Commander', 'Chakotay', 'Robert', 'Beltran', 'half-Klingon', 'Lt.', ""B'Elanna"", 'Torres', 'Roxann', 'Dawson', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'native', 'Ocampan', 'Kes', 'Jennifer', 'Lien', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'only', 'Lt.', 'Thomas', 'Eugene', 'Paris', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'native', 'Talaxian', 'Neelix', 'Ethan', 'Phillips', 'holographic', 'Emergency', 'Medical', 'Holographic', 'Program', 'a.k.a.', 'Doctor', 'played', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Vulcan', 'Lt.', 'Cmdr', 'Tuvok', 'Tim', 'Russ', 'Ensign', 'Harry', 'Kim', 'Garrett', 'Wang', 'former', 'Borg', 'drone', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'Voyager', 'fourth', 'season', 'second', 'part', 'episode', 'Scorpion', 'Part', '2', 'third', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'Voyager', 'making', 'agreement', 'Borg', 'aid', 'war', 'seemingly', 'unstoppable', 'species', '8472.With', 'departure', 'Kes', 'second', 'episode', 'Gift', 'fourth', 'season', 'Voyager', 'much', 'attention', 'newest', 'crewmember', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'whom', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'chose', 'cut', 'off', 'Borg', 'Collective', 'end', 'episode', 'Scorpion', 'Part', '2', 'relearn', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'primarily', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'also', 'holographic', 'doctor', 'Other', 'stories', 'fourth', 'season', 'include', ""B'Elanna"", 'ongoing', 'struggles', 'Klingon', 'half', 'change', 'relationship', 'Paris', ""B'Elanna"", 'Cmdr', 'Chakotay', 'involved', 'interspecies', 'war', 'episode', 'Nemesis', 'doctor', 'psychopathic', 'hologram', 'Leland', 'Orser', 'episode', 'Revulsion', 'crew', 'source', 'many', 'physical', 'problems', 'afflicting', 'crew', 'episode', 'Scientific', 'Method', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'enjoy', 'time', 'holodeck', 'Leonardo', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Voyager', 'encounters', 'hunting', 'Hirogen', 'Voyager', 'most', 'dangerous', 'substance', 'known', 'Federation', 'episode', 'Omega', 'Directive', 'best', 'fourth-season', 'episodes', 'order', 'airdate', 'include', 'Scorpion', 'Part', '2', 'Gift', 'Day', 'Honor', 'Nemesis', 'Revulsion', 'Raven', 'Scientific', 'Method', 'Year', 'Hell', 'Part', '1', '2', 'Concerning', 'Flight', 'Waking', 'Moments', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'Prey', 'Omega', 'Directive', 'One', 'Hope', 'Fear', '.Overall', 'rate', 'fourth', 'season', 'Voyager', '4.5', '5', 'stars', 'rounded', '5', 'stars', 'Thankfully', 'Kazon', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'around', 'Hirogen', 'become', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'predictable', 'time', 'many', 'Voyager', 'fans', 'regretted', 'loss', 'character', 'Kes', 'development', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'continued', 'get', 'better', 'succeeding', 'seasons', 'as', 'well', 'further', 'story', 'development', 'Borg', 'collective']",N/A
838054,A3ARKIF3FNB5HV,B0002JP4GE,Michael D. Goolsby,"[13, 15]","It finally had to happen.  There were clues from Season 3 that it was going to happen, there was going to be a run-in (or several) with the Borg in the Delta Quadrant.  Once again, Janeway makes a bad mistake in her assessment of striking up an alliance with an alien race just to save her crew and get home.  Her only saving grace this time was that they were taking on a more formidable adversary in Species 8472 from fluidic space (as if taking over this space was not good enough for the Borg) and that if she made this deal with the devil, the devil in turn would grant her and her crew safe passage through Borg Space.  There would be more run-ins throughout the series, especially when the crew discovers how to use trans-warp coils and the conduits they open up to get through space even faster than just warp speed.  Especially with the not-so-willing-at-first assistance from 7 Of 9, Tertiary Adjunct Of Unimatrix 01, the grown-up collectivized version of a human girl by the name of Annika Hansen, whose bohemian parents some years ago were pursuing an anthropological study of a mythical race of cyerbernetic organisms called the Borg some 20 years before.But there's more to this season than just the Borg--the Year Of Hell, which started out as Kes' premonition in Season 3, became a reality for this crew--or did it?  We may never know unless we have seen the episode.  Kurtwood Smith from ""That 70's Show"" plays a scientist who discovers how to use time as his weapon to bring back his dead wife, only to discover that when he manipulates on part of the timeline, it screws up other parts of it--and then realizes that they would not be so screwed up if it weren't for the fact that Voyager is in the wrong place and that this wild variable seems to thwart the very results he is seeking.  And so he undertakes to destroy Voyager only to find out that Voyager turns his weapon against him and in the end, we wonder whether or not the ""Year Of Hell"" really happened.We are also introduced to the Hirojen, a race/tribe of hunters whose entire culture is predicated on the hunt and the pursuit of prey.  They discover Voyager at this communications array that can relay information to the Alpha Quadrant and Janeway and her crew use it to successfully communicate a message to Starfleet.  The Hirojen swoop in and destroy the array and then pursue Voyager.  In the end, this hunt forever changes the Hirojen when they finally capture Voyager and discover the histories of Earth and Kronos as they force their hunters and the Voyager to relive these events.Of course, the communications with Startfleet Command yield some continuing disappointments for the crew, when the Maquis learned that most of their comrades in the Alpha Quadrant were wiped out by the Dominion--something that the Cardassians could not do by themselves if you followed ""DS9"".  It also yielded more bad news for the crew when they finally deciphered all of Starfleet's message back to them--that there was no way to get them back home quickly but if they find a way, they will let Voyager know.  Just like ""Basics"", it hammers the fact into the Voyager crew that they still out there alone in the Delta Quadrant.The season final&eacute; was not a cliffhanger.  If anything it was a reminder to Janeway about what the consequences were of assisting the Borg in their fight against Species 8472 and that the Borg were more than happy to use the weapon that Janeway helped them build against other species and peoples--whom they could not assimilate before because their DNA structures were too complex.  This also would become an issue in later seasons until the Series Final&eacute; when eventually she would have to make another that would either save her crew and deliver them home then-and-there or spend 16 more years trying to get them home the hard way.",5,Season 4 - The Start Of Building Up To The Series Final&eacute;,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,3843,"['finally', 'had', 'happen', 'were', 'clues', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'run-in', 'several', 'Borg', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'Once', 'again', 'Janeway', 'bad', 'mistake', 'assessment', 'striking', 'up', 'alliance', 'alien', 'race', 'just', 'save', 'crew', 'get', 'home', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'time', 'was', 'were', 'taking', 'more', 'formidable', 'adversary', 'Species', '8472', 'fluidic', 'space', 'taking', 'over', 'space', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'Borg', 'made', 'deal', 'devil', 'devil', 'turn', 'would', 'grant', 'crew', 'safe', 'passage', 'Borg', 'Space', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'run-ins', 'series', 'especially', 'when', 'crew', 'how', 'use', 'trans-warp', 'coils', 'conduits', 'open', 'up', 'get', 'space', 'even', 'faster', 'just', 'warp', 'speed', 'Especially', 'not-so-willing-at-first', 'assistance', '7', '9', 'Tertiary', 'Adjunct', 'Unimatrix', '01', 'grown-up', 'collectivized', 'version', 'human', 'girl', 'name', 'Annika', 'Hansen', 'bohemian', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'pursuing', 'anthropological', 'study', 'mythical', 'race', 'cyerbernetic', 'organisms', 'called', 'Borg', '20', 'years', 'before.But', 'more', 'season', 'just', 'Borg', 'Year', 'Hell', 'started', 'out', 'Kes', 'premonition', 'Season', '3', 'became', 'reality', 'crew', 'did', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', '70', 'Show', 'scientist', 'who', 'how', 'use', 'time', 'weapon', 'bring', 'back', 'dead', 'wife', 'only', 'discover', 'when', 'part', 'timeline', 'up', 'other', 'parts', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Voyager', 'wrong', 'place', 'wild', 'variable', 'thwart', 'very', 'results', 'seeking', 'so', 'destroy', 'Voyager', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'Voyager', 'weapon', 'end', 'wonder', 'not', 'Year', 'Hell', 'really', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Hirojen', 'race/tribe', 'hunters', 'entire', 'culture', 'predicated', 'hunt', 'pursuit', 'prey', 'discover', 'Voyager', 'communications', 'array', 'can', 'relay', 'information', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'Janeway', 'crew', 'use', 'successfully', 'communicate', 'message', 'Starfleet', 'Hirojen', 'swoop', 'destroy', 'array', 'then', 'pursue', 'Voyager', 'end', 'hunt', 'forever', 'Hirojen', 'when', 'finally', 'capture', 'Voyager', 'discover', 'histories', 'Earth', 'Kronos', 'force', 'hunters', 'Voyager', 'relive', 'events.Of', 'course', 'communications', 'Startfleet', 'Command', 'yield', 'continuing', 'disappointments', 'crew', 'when', 'Maquis', 'learned', 'most', 'comrades', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'were', 'wiped', 'out', 'Dominion', 'something', 'Cardassians', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'followed', 'DS9', 'also', 'yielded', 'more', 'bad', 'news', 'crew', 'when', 'finally', 'deciphered', 'Starfleet', 'message', 'back', 'was', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'quickly', 'find', 'way', 'will', 'let', 'Voyager', 'know', 'Just', 'Basics', 'fact', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'still', 'there', 'alone', 'Delta', 'Quadrant.The', 'season', 'final', 'eacute', 'was', 'not', 'cliffhanger', 'anything', 'was', 'reminder', 'Janeway', 'what', 'consequences', 'were', 'assisting', 'Borg', 'fight', 'Species', '8472', 'Borg', 'were', 'more', 'happy', 'use', 'weapon', 'Janeway', 'helped', 'build', 'other', 'species', 'peoples', 'whom', 'could', 'not', 'assimilate', 'DNA', 'structures', 'were', 'too', 'complex', 'also', 'would', 'become', 'issue', 'later', 'seasons', 'Series', 'Final', 'eacute', 'when', 'eventually', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'would', 'either', 'save', 'crew', 'deliver', 'home', 'then-and-there', 'spend', '16', 'more', 'years', 'trying', 'get', 'home', 'hard', 'way']",N/A

Jeri Ryan is an intelligent, talented Actress, who brought the 7 of 9 character out above her beauty. . Plus, it was nice to see a woman as captain, finally!! Usually on Star Trek, if women did have rank, their rolls were very short. Captain Janeway was a leader, tough and compassionate, demanding and empathetic. Qualities and strength not portrayed as much in the male Captains. I loved the Kess character and wish they let her come back after her evolution into a new lifeform. Great Actress!!

DS9 won the critics over and many fans proclaimed it the winner.  I always favored Voyager because its mission was always that of exploration and meeting &#34;new&#34; species giving that show greater scope and potential, and following the original Star Trek mandate. The years have given us the distance and purview to better assess the qualities of both shows and clearly Voyager is superior. Although I hated to see the lovely Kes leave the ship (and the series) in this season, the addition of Seven of Nine was a spark of inspiration. Captain Janeway vs. obdurate Borg female served to provide some meaty plots and the fact that Jeri Ryan is a very attractive, well constructed lady didn't hurt a bit.  The characters are generally well played, especially the Doctor (EMH), who the writers picked up as a persona that could provide lots of plot material and added a bit of light-hearted humor to the show.  The are some real bombs in this season but some exceptional stories as well.  But always entertaining.

838072,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002JP4GE,Robert Moore,"[2, 2]","After three initial seasons that were disappointing given the tremendous potential that the show initially displayed, Season Four was on nearly every level a great improvement.  The reasons were mainly threefold:  a slight increase in a serial rather than episodic approach to the narrative, a sharp improvement in the overall writing, and Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine.Although the premise of the series would have seemed to demand a serial narrative, for three seasons the show doggedly persisted in an almost pure episodic approach.  Thus, a show that seemed to be structured around the idea of a developing narrative showed almost no development whatsoever.  In Season Four an episodic format was still adhered to, but more and more elements carried over from one episode to another.  As a result there was a marked feeling that the show was going somewhere.  It also helped that they abandoned some of the races that were prevalent in the first seasons.  It seemed silly that after two years of faster than light travel the Kazons still seemed to be everywhere.  But with Season Four, the Kazons have been left behind.  Also, it seemed increasingly absurd that Neelix would possess detailed knowledge of planets this far out.  But in Season Four, after one odd lapse where after being propelled past Borg space he still had knowledge of some of the territory (I suspect that the production had wrapped before the producers decided that he would no longer be familiar with the upcoming regions), Neelix's knowledge has been exhausted.  This is partially replaced by Seven of Nine, who as a former member of the Borg collective possessed knowledge of species everywhere.I'm not quite sure how to account for the improvement in the writing.  But suffice it to say the almost endless number of hackneyed, derivative stories that populated the first three seasons largely disappeared.  There were few episodes that were truly awful.  Most were at least interesting.But along with the increasing number of serial elements, far and away the greatest improvement in the series came from the arrival of a new character, Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine.  Sadly, this came at the expense of Jennifer Lien's Kes leaving the show.  There have been a number of rumors surrounding Lien's departure from the show, some of them unflattering to Lien but also apparently completely unsubstantiated.  The truth appears to be something like this:  there was a sense that they needed a new character to improve the show and Seven of Nine was therefore created.  But because of budgetary concerns they needed to eliminate an opening credits character.  As Season Three was winding down the producers were leaning toward killing off Harry Kim (and at the end of the finale his situation was dire), but during the hiatus they changed their minds and decided to eliminate Kes instead.  I personally lament the loss of Kes, but there is absolutely no question that Seven of Nine is a huge improvement.  She is, in fact, one of the most compelling characters of any show in the Star Trek franchise.  There had, of course, been a former member of the Borg initiative in STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.  But this was the first attempt to have a Borg as a fulltime character in the show.  Jeri Ryan did an amazing job in the role.  And for males (and perhaps females as well), she was equally impressive in the manner that she filled out her body tight uniform (not since the sixties BATMAN and Catwoman has a cat suit been put to such amazing use).  A majority of the top moments of the season involved Seven of Nine in a crucial way.  My personal favorite is the late Season Four episode ""One,"" in which the whole crew is put in stasis so that they can cross a radiation-filled portion of space.  Seven, because of her Borg nanites, can resist the radiation.  Even the Doctor has to be shut down because of the manner in which the radiation interferes with his program.  Seven started the season as part of a hive mind, sharing the consciousness of millions.  She ends it heroically fighting her own loneliness as she strives to save the lives of everyone on Voyager.Still, the show remained, like all the shows in the Star Trek franchise, a victim of its own timidity.  It never takes risks, but instead constantly gives the appearance of risks.  Take the pair of episodes ""Year of Hell.""  On these episodes Voyager gradually takes more and more damage, until by the end it was a completely battered hulk.  Now, on a superior series, like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new one, not the old one) or FARSCAPE, they would have left the ship precisely that way, battered and with many of its systems destroyed or at risk.  We then would have seen the attempt to deal with the damage become a major part of the narrative.  But VOYAGER is not capable of this kind of risk-taking.  Instead, at the very end of the episode, they do a ""re-set"" and everything on Voyager is exactly as it was when it began.  In their defense, not many shows were in 1997-1998 taking many chances.  In fact, the first show that really introduced genuine risk into its format was BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, whose first full season was during this same year (it debuted in the spring of 1997 with a truncated Season One).  THE X-FILES had engaged in some minor risk taking, but it was only on BUFFY, with such events as Angel reverting to Angelus and the death of Jenny Calendar that we first got a show where the unthinkable actually started happening.  FARSCAPE was the first Sci-fi series that drew upon the lessons of BUFFY (there is before this the case of BABYLON 5, but I won't go into that here).  Unlike on VOYAGER, on FARSCAPE the unimaginable would sometimes happen (and in appreciation explicit references to BUFFY were made in homage).  This timidity on VOYAGER is frustrating given the excellence of the show's premise and the excellent group of characters.  I believe that BUFFY (along with THE X-FILES) rewrote the rules of how adventure shows on TV are done (in a host of ways, from serial format to the very long story arc to the body count), but VOYAGER unfortunately was one of the last significant Sci-fi series developed in the pre-BUFFY era.Finally, big kudos to the show for doing what the vast majority of shows ever made fail to do:  VOYAGER actually got significantly better in its fourth season.  Most shows by this point are running on fumes, but VOYAGER improved.  Not many shows are able to do this.  They are in this way quite exceptional.",4,A dramatic improvement over the first three seasons,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,6503,"['three', 'initial', 'seasons', 'were', 'disappointing', 'given',

Anyway, I purchased this DVD set about two months ago when it was on sale at a price that I just could not refuse, and I am only now getting around to watching it. So far it's been great. Lots of Borg action in these episodes what with the addition of an exciting new cast member, Jeri Ryan who plays Seven of Nine. Seven of Nine is a lady who was once part of the Borg collective and is now mostly human with the help of Captain Janeway, the Doctor, and the rest of the Voyager crew, and she is trying to fit in with her new life on the Voyager starship. Also of special note is that cast regular Kes, played by Jennifer Lien, is no longer with the show. She makes a couple of appearances but that's about it. She will be missed. But life on Voyager goes on and Seven of Nine really makes that life just a little bit more interesting. I can't wait to see where it all leads to.There's really not much more that I can add to this review because I haven't watched all of the episodes just yet.

But at the same time it was not much worse just the complaints are different. There are some good things in the season but also some bad things, unfortunately bad thing although fewer, concern a more important aspects of the show.Lets start with the good parts. There are a lot of very good episodes. The Killing game parts I and II, Year of Hell parts I and II are good two part episodes with good stories and a lot of special effects. Massage in the bottle is very funny and entertaining. I also like Living witness where doctor is defending the Voyager legacy 700 years in the future. Episodes One and Hope and Fear are very good and I like Scientific Method and Waking moments for their nice stories.Robert Beltran has two good episodes, Nemesis and Unforgettable. In Nemesis his character is a witness of an alien mind control and in Unforgettable he has some tender moments with a new love interest. Beltran delivers good performances in both episodes but later in the show disappears like most of the cast in front of Jerry Ryan and Kate Mulgrew as their relationship slowly becomes the central point of the show.Introduction and exploration of the Hirogen race in Hunters, Pray and The Killing Game is a nice addition to the show. Hirogen race becomes much more complex in The Killing game than it was assumed when they were introduced. Even though Hirogen remind me of Predator from a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, they are sufficiently different not to be an exact copy. The race and its heritage is very well written and developed. This is one of the best parts of Season IV.There is a nice story line this season about the contact with the Alpha quadrant. The story line begins in Massage in the Bottle, and continues through Hunters and Prey and is again touched upon in Hope and Fear. It is interesting to see that the show can be very good when there is a story line which actually has something to do with the original premise of trying to get home.There a also the bad parts of the show. Even though Seven of Nine is a good character and deserves a place in Star Trek but, not as much attention as she gets. The development of the character was very and in the space of only three episodes she transforms from a Borg drone into a vision of beauty and Kes is removed to make room for her.During the season writers frequently pay a lot of attention on the development of her character. In episode Revulsion Seven and Kim have their famous conversation about love and sexuality. The following episode The Raven is exclusively devoted to explaining the origins of Seven and her assimilation into Borg collective. In the next episode Seven is a savior of Voyager when her and the doctor stop the aliens who are conducting experiments on the crew.In Massage in the Bottle it was Seven who discovered the alien communications grid and managed to get the massage to Starfleet. In Hunters it was Seven that was kidnapped and brought aboard the Hirogen vessel. In Prey we have a big confrontation between Seven and the Captain and some of her rights are revoked. Following episode, Retrospect, is again focused on Seven of Nine and her struggle with human emotions. In The Killing Game she is again responsible for saving Voyager, and as a bonus we get to see Jerry Ryan sing.In episode The Omega directive the writers again emphasize spirituality and faith as the only way for Seven to become human. Faith implies belief without the need for evidence which, for Borg, should be impossible but the writers ignore that fact and present Omega molecule as god for the Borg. Again moving further away from Star Trek spirit, not to mention ruining continuity with previous ideas about Borg. In the final two episodes Seven is again featured very strongly.In One she is the only hope of Voyager and in the last episode she is the one captured with Janeway. In this episode the relationship between Janeway and Seven begins to form as friendship.The performances of Jerry Ryan are very good and Seven is a good character but, as I said before, she is becoming an overwhelming presence rather than a part of the show.The Year of Hell Part II ends with the image of Annorax creating his weapon again, or for the first time. It is unclear is it in the future or in the past. It must be in the past since it was said that he was on his mission for 200 years. So his changes from, lets say 5 years in the past may have led to the changes in the Voyager timeline, so by ending the episode thus, the writers bring into question all the events in the Delta quadrant and all the previous episodes, contradicting everything. But, this is just a TV show, everything is allowed more so since this is science fiction.Mortal Coil is beautiful episode but it's not science fiction since the same story could be done in any other setting. More and more episodes are focused on characters and much less time is attributed to science fiction and Star Trek. In previous Star Trek series this type of episodes were much rarer and the personal information about characters were much less available. It seems that the American fascination with privacy has penetrated Star Trek in a big way. That is the biggest complaint about this season of Voyager and science fiction series in general.I will count Omega Directive and Concerning flight among the bad parts of the season even though these episodes are interesting.Concerning flight is very interesting and entertaining but has one very big thing against it. It is not consistent with the Starfleet spirit which is particularly visible by Janeway patronizing Leonardo. Leonardo was a genius and that is illustrated by his quick adaptation of his flying machine to new materials which actually make the machines flight possible. This makes Janeway attitude toward him that much more illogical and patronizing. There is the line ""Do you accept that there is something that your mind can not comprehend"" (not an exact quote) to which the Leonardo replies ""Yes."" That is as far away from Roddenberrys vision of Starfleet as it can get, never mind the fact that Leonardo would never accept it. Philosophy contained in this episode is exact opposite from the philosophy of ST:The Next Generation which promotes reason as the main weapon of human kind. Besides that all other complaints are minor.Fourth season is behind me and it really provoked mixed feelings. I really wanted to like it but some of the parts of the show really annoyed me. Voyager is turning into a show about Seven of Nine with all the other characters put aside. It is a shame since after the third season it looked like it is going to be a really good show. I'm keeping my expectations of the fifth season much lower. Maybe then it will actually look better than it is.",3,The wrong direction,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,6883,"['hoped', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'season', 'was', 'better', 'season', 'three',

838097,A3DDLG3X183LYS,B0002JP4GE,T. Searcy,"[0, 0]","The fourth season of Star Trek Voyager is arguable the best of Voyager (in my opinion the only season close to rivaling this one is 5...maybe 7).  The conclusion of Scorpion to start the season, in my opinion the best Voyager episode, and second only to TNGs Best of Both Worlds, is all kinds of awesome.  Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) being added to the cast in place of Kes is brilliant.  Her very presence was something Voyager was lacking.  Voyager covers a lot of ground in Season 4.  Obviously, the Borg, as in episodes Scorpion II, The Raven, and there is Borg involved in Hope and Fear.  We have another time travel story in Year of Hell I and II, which is excellent.  We cover ethics and science, in various grounds, in episodes like Living Witness, Concerning Flight, and Scientific Method.  The Hirogen are introduced in this season as well, an alien I really like, who didn't seem to get the play they deserved.  But this season rarely misses a beat, regardless of what the story is about, or which character(s) seem to be the focus.  Message in a Bottle is a fun story (emphasis on fun, with Andy Dick playing an EMH on a vessel in the Alpha Quadrant), and The Omega Directive is a genius episode.  Species 8472 returns later in the season after Scorpion in the episode Prey.

838099,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0002JP4GE,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[6, 6]","Season 4 of ""Voyager"" showcases ""Voyager"" at the beginning of its peak form away from the shadow of big brother ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"". Janeway and her crew encountered the Borg at in the season ending ""Scorpion, Part 1"". In Part 2 Janeway makes a pact with the devil; she agrees to stay with the Borg to develop a weapon against Species 8472. The Borg bit off more than they could chew; Species 8472 is from fluidic space and the Borg encountered them through an interdimensional rift in space. Janeway develops the weapon but is incapacitated before being able to launch it. This two part episode cranked up the conflict and threat to Voyager. Now the ship had to continue their journey without encountering the Borg again. The Borg Drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains aboard against her will initially but, ultimately, as she begins to regain her humanity becomes part of Voyager's family. Seven of Nine provided the series with the perfect foil for some of the other characters; in many respects she is the Data or Mr. Spock of this series.Other outstanding episodes include the two part ""Year of Hell"" with guest star Kurtwood Smith (""Robocop"" and ""That 70's Show"")in a tale of time travel gone wrong. Annorax (Smith) uses a temporal weapon to continuously alter the space time continuum constantly altering time and exposing Voyage to new and different perils. Some of my favorite episodes involve Janeway's Da Vinci program. Da Vinci (the marvelous John Rhys-Davies of ""Sliders"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" fame)becomes a key to helping the Voyage crew relocate their stolen technology when his program is stolen as well. ""Waking Moments"" focuses on a monster not unlike Freddie Kruger who stalks his victims in their dreams but, unlike Kruger, this alien wants to keep his victims alive so he can feed off their fear.The Predator inspired Hirogen appear in ""Hunters"",""Prey"" and the two part ""The Killing Game"". ""Prey"" is a strong episode that deal with Seven of Nine's conflict about helping a species that is the enemy of the Borg. ""The Killing Game"" written by two of ""Next Gen's"" best writers (Brannon Braga and Joe Menosky)tells the story of what happens when the Hirogen take Voyager. They subject the crew to brainwashing and put them into holograhpic simulations (with the safety off)putting them in harm's way essentially creating a killing field with Voyager crew members as the victims. ""Demon"", ""One"" (which was recently remade for ""Enterprise"")and ""Hope and Fear"" round out a season of strong episodes.Overall, a fine collection of episodes and one of the finest seasons produced of ""Voyager"" Highly recommended. The picture quality is comparable to past sets although I'm still not a big fan of the packaging (I'm getting used to it though). The extras including interviews with Jeri Ryan, writer Brannon Braga and other cast members about the transition from season three to four and the shift in the character dynamics with a new character aboard are interesting. They fail to resolve one major issue, though, which is the fact that the changes in the show were designed to improve sagging ratings by introducing strong villians and a character with more incommon with Spock, Odo and Data. It certainly worked for, while the first three seasons had their great moments, the intense conflict created by Seven of Nine's introduction and the story possibilities made an interesting show even more intriguing.",5,"Strong season for ""Voyager""",1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,3440,"['Season', '4', 'Voyager', 'Voyager', 'beginning', 'peak', 'form', 'away', 'shadow', 'big', 'brother', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Janeway', 'crew', 'encountered', 'Borg', 'season', 'ending', 'Scorpion', 'Part', '1', 'Part', '2', 'Janeway', 'pact', 'devil', 'stay', 'Borg', 'develop', 'weapon', 'Species', '8472', 'Borg', 'bit', 'off', 'more', 'could', 'chew', 'Species', '8472', 'fluidic', 'space', 'Borg', 'encountered', 'interdimensional', 'rift', 'space', 'Janeway', 'weapon', 'incapacitated', 'being', 'able', 'launch', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'cranked', 'up', 'conflict', 'threat', 'Voyager', 'Now', 'ship', 'had', 'continue', 'journey', 'encountering', 'Borg', 'again', 'Borg', 'Drone', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'aboard', 'will', 'initially', 'ultimately', 'regain', 'humanity', 'part', 'Voyager', 'family', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'provided', 'series', 'perfect', 'foil', 'other', 'characters', 'many', 'respects', 'Data', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'series.Other', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'include', 'two', 'part', 'Year', 'Hell', 'guest', 'star', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'Robocop', '70', 'Show', 'tale', 'time', 'travel', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Annorax', 'Smith', 'temporal', 'weapon', 'continuously', 'alter', 'space', 'time', 'continuum', 'constantly', 'altering', 'time', 'exposing', 'Voyage', 'new', 'different', 'perils', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'involve', 'Janeway', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'program', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'marvelous', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Sliders', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'fame', 'key', 'helping', 'Voyage', 'crew', 'relocate', 'stolen', 'technology', 'when', 'program', 'stolen', 'as', 'well', 'Waking', 'Moments', 'monster', 'not', 'Freddie', 'Kruger', 'who', 'stalks', 'victims', 'dreams', 'Kruger', 'alien', 'keep', 'victims', 'alive', 'so', 'can', 'feed', 'off', 'fear.The', 'Predator', 'inspired', 'Hirogen', 'appear', 'Hunters', 'Prey', 'two', 'part', 'Killing', 'Game', 'Prey', 'strong', 'episode', 'deal', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'conflict', 'helping', 'species', 'enemy', 'Borg', 'Killing', 'Game', 'written', 'two', 'Next', 'Gen', 'best', 'writers', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'Joe', 'Menosky', 'story', 'what', 'when', 'Hirogen', 'take', 'Voyager', 'subject', 'crew', 'brainwashing', 'put', 'holograhpic', 'simulations', 'safety', 'off', 'putting', 'harm', 'way', 'essentially', 'creating', 'killing', 'field', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'members', 'victims', 'Demon', 'One', 'was', 'recently', 'remade', 'Enterprise', 'Hope', 'Fear', 'round', 'season', 'strong', 'episodes.Overall', 'fine', 'collection', 'episodes', 'one', 'finest', 'seasons', 'produced', 'Voyager', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'picture', 'quality', 'comparable', 'past', 'sets', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'packaging', ""'m"", 'getting', 'used', 'extras', 'including', 'interviews', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'writer', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'transition', 'season', 'three', 'four', 'shift', 'character', 'dynamics', 'new', 'character', 'aboard', 'are', 'interesting', 'fail', 'resolve', 'one', 'major', 'issue', 'fact', 'changes', 'show', 'were', 'designed', 'improve', 'sagging', 'ratings', 'introducing', 'strong', 'villians', 'character', 'more', 'incommon', 'Spock', 'Odo', 'Data', 'certainly', 'worked', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'had', 'great', 'moments', 'intense', 'conflict', 'created', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'introduction', 'story', 'possibilities', 'made', 'interesting', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'intriguing']",N/A
