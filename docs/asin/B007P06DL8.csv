It was however played heavily at and around rallies and filtering to our house during the mass gatherings that occurred in public squares through the 90s. (I live on a ridge overlooking town called the Berea)So Graceland is the soundtrack for the end of Apartheid for me; it is also now one of my favourite albums.

1535555,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B007P06DL8,K. Gordon,"[7, 10]","This documentary celebrates the 25th anniversary of Paul Simon's great Graceland' album. At the same time it questionsSimon's political choices in going to South Africa to record during the U.N. approved cultural boycott, seeking to keep SouthAfrica isolated and thus put more pressure on the white regime to step down.Simon's reply is that artists shouldn't be subject to arbitrary political decisions - they must follow their heart and muse first, andhe did more to help raise awareness of South Africa by going than by staying away.The film doesn't take clear sides on these questions and that's fine, a documentary doesn't have to take sides on such a morallycomplex issue to be successful.But there is something a bit slippery in Simon's somewhat pat answers that seem to be given a pass. And a meeting between Simonand Dali Tambo, the South African head of 'Artists Against Apartheid' feels awkward and staged, each man explaining to the other theirpoint of view on what happened, ending with what felt like a very forced forgiveness hug.Is the film letting Simon off too easily? Or is his very awkwardness Berlinger's point? (even his embraces of the musicians who played withhim on the album sometimes feel like they might not have happened if there wasn't a camera rolling) .One telling detail, the fact that Simon took first credit on all the music, even though - as we hear some of the original pre-Simoninstrumentals from the album - we realize that many of the songs are almost identical, just somewhat re-arranged by Simon. Taking firstwriting credit seems like an act of hubris that the film never mentions or questions.",4,Always fascinating and sometimes uncomfortable (mostly in the good way),1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1635,"['documentary', '25th', 'anniversary', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'great', 'Graceland', 'album', 'same', 'time', 'questionsSimon', 'political', 'choices', 'going', 'South', 'Africa', 'record', 'U.N.', 'approved', 'cultural', 'boycott', 'seeking', 'keep', 'SouthAfrica', 'isolated', 'thus', 'put', 'more', 'pressure', 'white', 'regime', 'step', 'down.Simon', 'reply', 'artists', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'subject', 'arbitrary', 'political', 'decisions', 'must', 'follow', 'heart', 'muse', 'first', 'andhe', 'did', 'more', 'help', 'raise', 'awareness', 'South', 'Africa', 'going', 'staying', 'away.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'clear', 'sides', 'questions', 'fine', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'sides', 'morallycomplex', 'issue', 'be', 'successful.But', 'something', 'bit', 'slippery', 'Simon', 'somewhat', 'answers', 'seem', 'be', 'given', 'pass', 'meeting', 'Simonand', 'Dali', 'Tambo', 'South', 'African', 'head', ""'Artists"", 'Against', 'Apartheid', 'feels', 'staged', 'man', 'explaining', 'other', 'theirpoint', 'view', 'what', 'happened', 'ending', 'what', 'felt', 'very', 'forced', 'forgiveness', 'hug.Is', 'film', 'letting', 'Simon', 'too', 'easily', 'very', 'awkwardness', 'Berlinger', 'point', 'even', 'embraces', 'musicians', 'who', 'played', 'withhim', 'album', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'was', ""n't"", 'camera', 'rolling', '.One', 'telling', 'detail', 'fact', 'Simon', 'took', 'first', 'credit', 'music', 'even', 'though', 'hear', 'original', 'pre-Simoninstrumentals', 'album', 'realize', 'many', 'songs', 'are', 'almost', 'identical', 'just', 'somewhat', 're-arranged', 'Simon', 'Taking', 'firstwriting', 'credit', 'act', 'hubris', 'film', 'never', 'mentions', 'questions']",Under African Skies
