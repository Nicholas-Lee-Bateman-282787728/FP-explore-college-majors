775302,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000CBY0X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 6]","Greed is the ultimate theme of this film, and horror (with a slice of homoeroticism) director David DeCoteau realizes this early on and decides to build a film without the costumed monsters of the normal horror genre, but instead with suit wearing professionals that look and act just like you or I.  He brings this essence of realism into the film by never quite giving us the werewolf, but showing us how too much power, money, and corruption can ""transform"" a person just like the classic werewolf.  I felt several times that I was watching a rendition of a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" because we never actually see the wolves, instead we are shown the corporate suits that seem just like you and I.  While DeCoteau does a great job of building the issue that greed is bad, he completely misses the target known as story.  I can honestly say that this film has none to speak of.To build a good story you must first have a solid foundation.  In this film there were two foundations, Jeff Allen and the Wolfe Brothers.  With these two focal points firmly placed, DeCoteau attempts to build a frame and put siding on his story, but ultimately fails.  After consistently unfunny ""wolf"" jokes, DeCoteau uses the simple technique of flashback to give us the (sorry for the pun) meat of the story.  Those points that we missed because Allen was ""blacking out"" are shown in random, sporadic, and chaotic flash points.  Most of them are hard to follow and show either too much or too little of the story.  After the first set of these flashbacks, I just didn't care anymore.  For this film to truly succeed, I think that it needed a linear story for the audience to follow instead of random crumbs littering the floor.  This would have helped to build a stronger main character, a stronger relationship between Allen and Annabella (to explain the ending), and more sinister villains ... if you can call them that.  The technique was ok for the first time, but only added to a film that was quickly loosing momentum.So, we had a failing story, what else went wrong with this film?  Outside of Eric Roberts, which seemed like he was in a world all his own, there just seemed to be unanswered questions littering the open spaces of the film.  Annabella's ex-boyfriend's death seemed to be a fly in the pan, while her meeting with Dyson (Roberts) left me questioning her loyalty.  Who, or what, were these men anyway?  Were they cannibals or werewolves?  I would assume by the title of this film, Wolves of Wall Street, that it would be a simple answer.  I was wrong.  Even with the monotonous ""wolf"" innuendo, I couldn't quite guess.  I think the trouble that I was having was the full moon science.  How could there have been a full moon every night?  I know that it couldn't have been every night, but it felt like it during this film.  Perhaps if DeCoteau would have focused a bit more on the science of this film (perhaps watch a couple werewolf films) and less on his male actors removing their shirts in unison revealing their heavily muscled bodies, we could have had a better film.  But, I am no director, so what am I to say.Speaking of the actors, Eric Roberts went above and beyond for this film.  It impresses me that he puts so much emphasis on these little films, especially knowing whom his little sister is, and by placing this emphasis he carries this film on his shoulders.  This isn't hard considering whom he is working with.  The actor who plays Jeff Allen, Mr. William Gregory Lee, looked like he was acting his way through this film.  You could literally see the Drama 101 seeping from his sweat, and it was embarrassing.  The rest of the wolves...sorry...brokers were basically eye candy for the women whose husbands picked this film up after every copy of Mona Lisa Smile was gone.  Nobody helped bring this film to the next level except for Mr. Roberts.  The rest were pure dribble.Finally, I would like to add that if I pay my money to see a horror film, I would actually like to see some horror.  There was literally no blood in this film.  You would think that with a box showing men with shadows of wolves walking down the street, blood would be second nature.  This is not true.  It isn't until the end that you actually see blood for the first time, and by then it is so quick (or you are so bored) that it doesn't matter.  I needed some scares, some moments of genuine fright, some ... dare I say it ... horror for this film to work.  Instead what I found were cheap actors, horrible editing with crappy flashbacks, and no actual horror as far as the eye can see.Overall, it was a disappointment.  While I was not expecting anything extraordinary, I would have thought that somebody (outside Eric Roberts) would have cared about this project, but I guess I was wrong.  I needed more solidity with the story and a more focused director to help guide me through the piles of mess that the actors created.  I needed help, but nobody listened to my yelp.Grade: * out of *****",1,Wall Street's Meat Market.,1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,4994,"['Greed', 'ultimate', 'theme', 'film', 'horror', 'slice',

On second thought, the scene where the wolves rip off their shirts and crawl in their boxer briefs across the floor was pretty darned funny!  (Is there any other director that includes a thank you to Joe Boxer in the credits?)  Actually, my favorite thing about the movie is that the moon is always full in New York City.The music was awful, especially the embarrassing rap songs, the photography was repetitive (how many times do we have to see 55 Wall Street signs, or the view from the top of the building or, of course, the full moon?), and the acting was bottom-of-the-barrel.A couple of good actors got sucked into this mess.  Poor Louise Lasser appears for about 30 seconds.  When her name scrolled by on the credits it took me quite awhile to figure out what character she played.  And then there is Eric Roberts.  I hope they both made a decent salary on this one.",1,Howlingly bad!,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,1339,"['Wolves', 'Wall', 'Street', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'quasi-werewolf', 'movie', 'say', 'quasi-werewolf', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'werewolves', 'Obviously', 'grade', 'Z', 'production', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'special', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'man-to-wolf', 'transformation', 'not', 'even', 'fuzzy', 'wolf', 'man', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'qualify', 'So', 'bad', 'good', 'movie', 'campiness', 'other', 'DeCoteau', 'productions', 'enjoyable', 'least', 'tolerable', 'second', 'thought', 'scene', 'where', 'wolves', 'rip', 'off', 'shirts', 'crawl', 'boxer', 'briefs', 'floor', 'was', 'pretty', 'darned', 'funny', 'there', 'other', 'director', 'thank', 'Joe', 'Boxer', 'credits', 'Actually', 'favorite', 'thing', 'movie', 'moon', 'always', 'full', 'New', 'York', 'City.The', 'music', 'was', 'awful', 'especially', 'embarrassing', 'rap', 'songs', 'photography', 'was', 'repetitive', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'do', 'have', 'see', '55', 'Wall', 'Street', 'signs', 'view', 'top', 'building', 'course', 'full', 'moon', 'acting', 'was', 'bottom-of-the-barrel.A', 'couple', 'good', 'actors', 'got', 'sucked', 'mess', 'Poor', 'Louise', 'Lasser', '30', 'seconds', 'When', 'name', 'scrolled', 'credits', 'took', 'quite', 'awhile', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'character', 'played', 'then', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'hope', 'made', 'decent', 'salary', 'one']",N/A
775315,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B0000CBY0X,Serene Night,"[6, 7]","When pretty boy Jeff, decides to move to New York to get a job on Wall Street, he is shocked and amazed when he hits the big time and gets a job at Wolfe Brothers. Wolfe Brothers, ran by charismatic Dyson, seems like a dream job...Or is it...? His boss seems to have some unusual habits... Well, aside from urinating off of buildings he seems like a perfectly normal boss to me, (Grin). LOL. Things get strange, when Dyson begins hitting on his girlfriend, and the pack decides to make Jeff one of THEM. Can Jeff make it out alive? Or is he destined to be, just one of the pack.I liked this film a great deal. Especially the first part. I thought the ending was a little bad, (I love how the werewolves just stand around to be killed), and I felt that Jeff was a bit of a jerk to the pack alpha, whom I felt was a fairly nice guy for a  monster.I would've reworked the ending differently, perhaps having Jeff go on the run or ran the pack or something. The ending seemed rushed and made no real sense.Peeves? I was kind of bored at the beginning but this film really picks up.

775316,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B0000CBY0X,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[1, 2]","My answer to the question asked in my review title is an unqualified NO!  If your movie has no Werewolves in it then it is not a true Werewolf Movie.  This movie has not a single Werewolf in it.  The movie tries its best to be a Werewolf movie but all it succeeds at being is a overly long borning badly done movie about big business.  This movie is not about just any sort of big business either.  This is big business with a very lame supernatural plot revolving around unseen werewolves.Problem with Wolves of Wall Street is that the movie does not really seem to know what it was really supposed to be.  Wolves of Wall Street is not exactly about big business on Wall Street.  Wolves of Wall Street despite lots of big Werewolf sounding talk is not reality about Lycantrophy (Werewolves) because nowhere on the DVD will you see one Werewolf.  Wolves of Wall Street has nothing but shallow acting so none of the characters in Wolves of Wall Street is made real to a point where you exactly care about any of them.  Wolves of Wall Street is not exactly an occult movie. Wolves of Wall Street is not exactly well done.I could go on for years about what Wolves of Wall Street isn't exactly. The problem with Wolves of Wall Street is this movie that hints about werewolves is not exactly about anything in particular.  Werewolves of Wall Street seems to have gone about its task of not being exactly about anything with a ruthless unflinching laborary percision that would make any devoted perfectionist obsessive conpulsive mad scientist proud.Wolves of Wall Street is a Werewolf movie without any werewolves making it in effect a movie about nothing.  Wolves of Wall Street actually excels at being a movie about nothing.  I wonder why anyone would want to waste time watching Wolves of Wall Street when it is settled law that life never gives refunds on time spent watching this Lycantrophobic movie about Werewolves!I gave this two stars because most of Wolves of Wall Street is in focus, most of the colors are bright and those few parts of Wolves of Wall Street NOT mind numbingly tedious is at least funny in tried been there done that ways.  If you just collect Werewolf movies because you like them for its price Wolves of Wall Street is a good deal.  I just enjoy collecting all Werewolf DVD's but trust me Wolves of Wall Street is not something I'd ever want to watch twice.  Do like I did watch it once to be sure the DVD works as expected then put it on the shelf to gather dust.  Watch Wolves of Wall Street when you have that house guest that has worn out his \ her welcome but you are way too polite to just ask them to leave.  Wolves of Wall Street should have them running screaming to the door in moments.Caution do not show Wolves of Wall Street to airheads or people like me because, I'd love it so much a second showing would be a must.
