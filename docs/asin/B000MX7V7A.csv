1051741,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000MX7V7A,Cubist,"[18, 19]","Rob and Big is a reality show that tweaks The Odd Couple set-up with pro-skate boarder Rob Dyrdek, a scrawny white guy, and his best friend and bodyguard Christopher ""Big Black"" Boykin, a 300+lb black man, who share a house in the Hollywood Hills. Despite wildly contrasting physical attributes and backgrounds, Rob and Big's personalities compliment each other well: Rob is chatty and full of goofy energy while Big is more laid back and plays it cool.""Mississippi"" marks the first appearance of Big's beloved Uncle Jerry as the boys attend Big's family reunion deep in the ""Dirty South."" How does one begin to describe Uncle Jerry? He looks to be in his 60s and is barely intelligible but is funny as hell. He lets Rob borrow one of his suits for church and shows genuine compassion for the boys that is endearing as he is funny.Hands down and without a doubt, the best episode of either season is ""Bobby Light"" where Rob tries his hand at music by creating a persona known as Bobby Light, a one-hit wonder R&B; sensation. He records a song called, ""Dirty Girl"" along with filming an accompanying music video. He enlists the help of Big, his buddy Bam Bam and Uncle Jerry returns to play a prominent role. How does one do justice to Uncle Jerry and his unique take on life? Highlights include a Rob and Uncle Jerry dance-off, Rob assembling his Bobby Light outfit (including wig!) and the shooting of the ""Dirty Girl"" video.Every episode features an audio commentary by Rob, Big, executive producers Jeff Tremaine and Ruben Fleischer. They have a lot of fun reliving these moments from their lives, laughing at some of their exploits. Your enjoyment of these commentaries really depends on the episode and which ones you like the most.Disc Two features extras for the first season, including ""Special Meaty Puppy Footage,"" 15 additional scenes of Meaty as an adorable puppy back when Rob and Big first got him.""Rob & Big - `The Real Deal'"" takes a behind the scenes look at Rob & Big. They talk about how they met, their relationship and how they became roommates. Of course, they talk about Meaty and what he means to them. Rob & Big also talk about some of the highlights of Season 1 with clips.Also included are 23 deleted scenes including the installation of an ATM machine in their house. We also see Meaty and Big learning how to swim. The Chunky Boys perform live and Rob goes shopping for jewelry in order to go for that ""'80s football star"" look. We also see Rob and Big face off in a hot dog eating contest. Also included is Drama learning how to drive only to get in an accident.""Skate Tutorials"" features Rob teaching the fundamentals of skateboarding in these brief tutorials. He really makes it look easy but as anyone quickly realizes, to pull these moves off well you have to practice them a helluva lot.""Interviews"" are the extended versions of the soundbites in ""The Real Deal"" extra.Disc Four contains all of the extras for Season 2. The ""Dirty Girl"" music video that was shown being made during the ""Bobby Light"" episode is included in all of its cheesy glory. It has to be seen to be truly believed.Arguably the best extra in the entire set is the ""Special Uncle Jerry Footage"" featuring more hilarious scenes of Uncle Jerry in action: drinking beer, yelling ""Dirty Girl"" randomly and just being his usual awesome, original self.""MTV Cribs Appearance"" features Rob and Big giving us the tour of their pad and, of course, their vehicles. They even have their own ATM machine.Also included are 12 deleted scenes from the various episodes from Season 2.""The Best of Season 2"" is a highlight reel of the best moments from this season.Finally, there is ""Special Mini Footage"" of the miniature horse in action doing its thing.",5,"""He's my best friend...""",1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,3743,"['Rob', 'Big', 'reality', 'show', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'set-up', 'pro-skate', 'boarder', 'Rob', 'Dyrdek', 'scrawny', 'white', 'guy', 'best', 'friend', 'bodyguard', 'Christopher', 'Big', 'Black', 'Boykin', '300+lb', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'share', 'house', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'wildly', 'contrasting', 'physical', 'attributes', 'backgrounds', 'Rob', 'Big', 'personalities', 'compliment', 'other', 'well', 'Rob', 'chatty', 'full', 'goofy', 'energy', 'Big', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'cool', 'Mississippi', 'first', 'appearance', 'Big', 'beloved', 'Uncle', 'Jerry', 'boys', 'attend', 'Big', 'family', 'reunion', 'deep', 'Dirty', 'South', 'How', 'one', 'begin', 'describe', 'Uncle', 'Jerry', 'be', '60s', 'barely', 'intelligible', 'funny', 'hell', 'Rob', 'borrow', 'one', 'suits', 'church', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'boys', 'endearing', 'down', 'doubt', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'Bobby', 'Light', 'where', 'Rob', 'hand', 'music', 'creating', 'persona', 'known', 'Bobby', 'Light', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'R', 'B', 'sensation', 'song', 'called', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'filming', 'accompanying', 'music', 'video', 'help', 'Big', 'buddy', 'Bam', 'Bam', 'Uncle', 'Jerry', 'play', 'prominent', 'role', 'How', 'one', 'do', 'justice', 'Uncle', 'Jerry', 'unique', 'take', 'life', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Rob', 'Uncle', 'Jerry', 'dance-off', 'Rob', 'assembling', 'Bobby', 'Light', 'outfit', 'including', 'wig', 'shooting', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'video.Every', 'episode', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Rob', 'Big', 'executive', 'producers', 'Jeff', 'Tremaine', 'Ruben', 'Fleischer', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'reliving', 'moments', 'lives', 'laughing', 'exploits', 'enjoyment', 'commentaries', 'really', 'episode', 'ones', 'most.Disc', 'Two', 'features', 'extras', 'first', 'season', 'including', 'Special', 'Meaty', 'Puppy', 'Footage', '15', 'additional', 'scenes', 'Meaty', 'adorable', 'puppy', 'back', 'when', 'Rob', 'Big', 'first', 'got', 'Rob', 'Big', 'Real', 'Deal', 'scenes', 'look', 'Rob', 'Big', 'talk', 'how', 'met', 'relationship', 'how', 'became', 'roommates', 'course', 'talk', 'Meaty', 'what', 'Rob', 'Big', 'also', 'talk', 'highlights', 'Season', '1', 'clips.Also', 'included', 'are', '23', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'installation', 'ATM', 'machine', 'house', 'also', 'see', 'Meaty', 'Big', 'learning', 'how', 'swim', 'Chunky', 'Boys', 'perform', 'live', 'Rob', 'shopping', 'jewelry', 'order', 'go', ""'80s"", 'football', 'star', 'look', 'also', 'see', 'Rob', 'Big', 'face', 'off', 'hot', 'dog', 'eating', 'contest', 'Also', 'included', 'Drama', 'learning', 'how', 'drive', 'only', 'get', 'accident', 'Skate', 'Tutorials', 'features', 'Rob', 'teaching', 'fundamentals', 'skateboarding', 'brief', 'tutorials', 'really', 'look', 'easy', 'anyone', 'quickly', 'pull', 'moves', 'off', 'well', 'have', 'practice', 'helluva', 'lot', 'Interviews', 'are', 'extended', 'versions', 'soundbites', 'Real', 'Deal', 'Four', 'contains', 'extras', 'Season', '2', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'music', 'video', 'was', 'shown', 'being', 'made', 'Bobby', 'Light', 'episode', 'included', 'cheesy', 'glory', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'truly', 'believed.Arguably', 'best', 'extra', 'entire', 'set', 'Special', 'Uncle', 'Jerry', 'Footage', 'featuring', 'more', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'Uncle', 'Jerry', 'action', 'drinking', 'beer', 'yelling', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'randomly', 'just', 'being', 'usual', 'awesome', 'original', 'self', 'MTV', 'Cribs', 'Appearance', 'Rob', 'Big', 'giving', 'tour', 'pad', 'course', 'vehicles', 'even', 'have', 'own', 'ATM', 'machine.Also', 'included', 'are', '12', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'various', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'Best', 'Season', '2', 'highlight', 'reel', 'best', 'moments', 'season.Finally', 'Special', 'Mini', 'Footage', 'miniature', 'horse', 'action', 'doing', 'thing']",Rob & Big: The Complete First & Second Seasons

It is fun to see the shows without the editing beeps and commercials.  Also, the gold in this set is the Dirty Girl video.  I would buy the set just for the video itself. I could watch it over and over and still laugh each time.  Uncle Jerry's visit is priceless.  He is so funny just being himself.  You could not script the things he says and does.  Once he gets into that Bud Light, there is no stopping him from repeating himself 50 times and touching Rob any chance he gets.  There is also a commentary option where they narrate the episode and that is funny also.
