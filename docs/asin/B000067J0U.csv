Perhaps because it was released at a time of such intense interest, when audiences and reviewers were waiting for the next big thing, or perhaps because of the marketing, no one wanted to find fault with Chingu.But it isn't hard to do.The film purports to tell the story of four school mate chums who grow up to lead very different lives but who remain friends throughout.  In fact the movie is about two boys who grow up to be gangsters working for rival syndicates and who quite predictably come into conflict later in the film.  The third boy, whose point of view frames the movie, is a studious achiever who goes on to get his PhD in the United States.  The fourth boy is thrown in simply for comic relief and we never learn very much about him.The pace of the film is plodding, the music is overly sentimental and calls far too much attention itself (such as the weepy violins), you never really care much for any of the characters (who are, after all, drug sellers, murders, and pimps), the range of acting doesn't go beyond shades of sullen, the story is riddled with clich&eacute; about loyalty and duty, and the whole idea that the PhD would remain friends with these two thugs is simply preposterous and an obvious conceit.  If it weren't for the lovely cinematography, this film would have nothing to recommend it.",2,Wearisome gangster film,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1444,"['Korean', 'cinema', 'was', 'rage', 'opening', 'years', '00', 'was', 'one', 'country', 'more', 'popular', 'offerings', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'such', 'intense', 'interest', 'when', 'audiences', 'reviewers', 'were', 'waiting', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'perhaps', 'marketing', 'one', 'wanted', 'find', 'fault', 'Chingu.But', ""n't"", 'hard', 'do.The', 'film', 'purports', 'tell', 'story', 'four', 'school', 'mate', 'chums', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'lead', 'very', 'different', 'lives', 'who', 'remain', 'friends', 'fact', 'movie', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'gangsters', 'working', 'rival', 'syndicates', 'who', 'quite', 'predictably', 'come', 'conflict', 'later', 'film', 'third', 'boy', 'point', 'view', 'frames', 'movie', 'studious', 'achiever', 'who', 'get', 'PhD', 'United', 'States', 'fourth', 'boy', 'thrown', 'simply', 'comic', 'relief', 'never', 'learn', 'very', 'much', 'him.The', 'pace', 'film', 'plodding', 'music', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'such', 'weepy', 'violins', 'never', 'really', 'care', 'much', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'drug', 'sellers', 'murders', 'pimps', 'range', 'acting', ""n't"", 'go', 'shades', 'sullen', 'story', 'riddled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'loyalty', 'duty', 'whole', 'idea', 'PhD', 'would', 'remain', 'friends', 'two', 'thugs', 'simply', 'preposterous', 'obvious', 'conceit', 'were', ""n't"", 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'nothing', 'recommend']",Friend

However, there is no denying that this is an immensely entertaining film that works on so many different levels. With its memorable dialogues, and familiar yet compelling story that can be best described as ""Beat"" meets ""Once Upon a Time in America"", it's easy to see how ""Friend"" not only became the highest-grossing movie of all time in Korea, but also a cultural/social phenomenon. With a lot of Wong Kar-wai-esque angle shots and grainy cinematography, it is also one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in a long time.",5,Ain't no Sidabari,1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,779,"['Sure', 'Friend', 'share', 'flaws', 'apart', 'Oh-seong', 'Yu', 'who', 'superb', 'lead', 'role', 'acting', 'simply', 'awful', 'board', 'swift/subtle', 'storytelling', 'thick', 'Pusan', 'accent/slang', 'difficult', 'follow', 'plot', 'times', 'However', 'denying', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'memorable', 'dialogues', 'familiar', 'yet', 'compelling', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'Beat', 'Once', 'Time', 'America', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'Friend', 'not', 'only', 'became', 'highest-grossing', 'movie', 'time', 'Korea', 'also', 'cultural/social', 'phenomenon', 'lot', 'Wong', 'Kar-wai-esque', 'angle', 'shots', 'grainy', 'cinematography', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time']",Friend
703139,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B000067J0U,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[1, 2]","The story is simple; it's about four friends growing up in Pusan in the seventies. The real story comes from their weird mixture of personalities that fit but you don't expect to last after school. Jung-sook is the son of a mob boss and is the boss of his school and is said to be the best fighter in the school. His second boss Dong-su is suffering from being a follower and doesn't realize this until around the middle of the movie. Sang-taek is basically the genius nerd but Jung-sook likes him and protects him. Woon-taek is the class clown though he doesn't stand out that much. Every character has their own personality but only two really stand out and matter.The film starts with the four but mainly focuses on Dong-su and Jung-sook for the remainder of the film. The two end up becoming part of rival gangs and must settle their problems, which will last and stay friends to the end? I have no idea where to start with friend because after a while its flaws come from what you want to happen and not what happens. One major thing is if Jung-sook's father is so feared then why doesn't he at least look it even a little. There is very little film shown on the family's relationship with the mob while Jung-sook was young. I also agree with some other reviewers that some things were unbelievable. The movie uses the frail relationship of Jung-sook and Sang-taek to keep the theme of friend going. All this movie needed was to keep the light on Jung-sook and Dong-su from beginning to end. The real friendship of the film was between Jung-sook and Dong-su.Maybe the director didn't want this to truly be a gangster film but more of a drama but he should've gone gangster film all the way. If he did it completely in that style the film would've been way better. What's positive about ""Friend"" depends on what you like. I must agree that there were certain parts that I really enjoyed but mainly the end of the film. Some characters in the film that it could have benefited from went unfinished. Like Joong-ho who's character really needed more time in this movie didn't get it. The acting was pretty good which definitely kicks the films viewing worth up a notch. The music is awful and the picture quality is ok and could have been better but it works. This movie is more like 3.5 stars but If you've glanced at it in your video store every time you go in like me don't get it unless you've seen most of the other films available.",3,Sometimes You Have To Let Go,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,2438,"['story', 'simple', 'four', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', 'Pusan', 'seventies', 'real', 'story', 'weird', 'mixture', 'personalities', 'fit', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'last', 'school', 'Jung-sook', 'son', 'mob', 'boss', 'boss', 'school', 'said', 'be', 'best', 'fighter', 'school', 'second', 'boss', 'Dong-su', 'suffering', 'being', 'follower', ""n't"", 'realize', 'middle', 'movie', 'Sang-taek', 'basically', 'genius', 'nerd', 'Jung-sook', 'Woon-taek', 'class', 'clown', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'much', 'Every', 'character', 'own', 'personality', 'only', 'two', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'matter.The', 'film', 'starts', 'four', 'mainly', 'Dong-su', 'Jung-sook', 'remainder', 'film', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'part', 'rival', 'gangs', 'must', 'settle', 'problems', 'will', 'last', 'stay', 'friends', 'end', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'start', 'friend', 'while', 'flaws', 'come', 'what', 'want', 'happen', 'not', 'what', 'One', 'major', 'thing', 'Jung-sook', 'father', 'so', 'feared', 'then', 'why', ""n't"", 'least', 'look', 'even', 'little', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'shown', 'family', 'relationship', 'mob', 'Jung-sook', 'was', 'young', 'also', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'things', 'were', 'unbelievable', 'movie', 'frail', 'relationship', 'Jung-sook', 'Sang-taek', 'keep', 'theme', 'friend', 'going', 'movie', 'needed', 'was', 'keep', 'light', 'Jung-sook', 'Dong-su', 'beginning', 'end', 'real', 'friendship', 'film', 'was', 'Jung-sook', 'Dong-su.Maybe', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'truly', 'be', 'gangster', 'film', 'more', 'drama', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'gangster', 'film', 'way', 'did', 'completely', 'style', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'way', 'better', 'What', 'positive', 'Friend', 'what', 'like', 'must', 'agree', 'were', 'certain', 'parts', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'mainly', 'end', 'film', 'characters', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'went', 'unfinished', 'Joong-ho', 'who', 'character', 'really', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'definitely', 'films', 'viewing', 'worth', 'up', 'notch', 'music', 'awful', 'picture', 'quality', 'ok', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'more', '3.5', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'glanced', 'video', 'store', 'time', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'available']",Friend

703144,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B000067J0U,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[3, 3]","This Korean film follows the story of four friends, who met at school in the early 1980's. They stay friends and form tight bonds that come under strain through what appears to be a very harsh education system. They also have to face tough social and economic times as Korea struggled to become the Asian Tiger that we know of it in recent times.As time passes their different career choices lead them to lose touch and in the end become bitter rivals at either end of the crime and social divide. It stars Jang Dong Kun , who you may remember from `Brotherhood'. He does an excellent job and all the actors are up to the standard that you would expect from Korean cinema. There are touches of humour and some quite visceral fight scenes, especially amongst the students. There is a lot of attention to period detail I especially like Blondie being played at the `roller disco'; yes don't you just love the eighties.Director KT Kwak has done a really good job and there is some brilliant cinematography and as far as I could tell no CGI and really no need for it. I am a world cinema fan and so was looking forward to seeing this; it though, is not on a par with some other Asian and indeed Korean films. There could have been more done to engender empathy about the characters, but all that aside it was a satisfying 113 minutes. The title comes from the definition they discover of what a friend is, that being `a long and close companion'.  If you like Korean cinema you will not be disappointed but for a first foray into this area of cinema, this film is not a good place to start, I would go with `Brotherhood' or `Mother'.",4,Korean Crime Drama,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,1629,"['Korean', 'film', 'story', 'four', 'friends', 'who', 'met', 'school', 'early', '1980', 'stay', 'friends', 'form', 'tight', 'bonds', 'come', 'strain', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'harsh', 'education', 'system', 'also', 'have', 'face', 'tough', 'social', 'economic', 'times', 'Korea', 'struggled', 'become', 'Asian', 'Tiger', 'know', 'recent', 'times.As', 'time', 'different', 'career', 'choices', 'lead', 'lose', 'touch', 'end', 'become', 'bitter', 'rivals', 'end', 'crime', 'social', 'divide', 'Jang', 'Dong', 'Kun', 'who', 'may', 'remember', 'Brotherhood', 'excellent', 'job', 'actors', 'are', 'up', 'standard', 'would', 'expect', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'are', 'touches', 'humour', 'quite', 'visceral', 'fight', 'scenes', 'especially', 'students', 'lot', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'especially', 'Blondie', 'being', 'played', 'roller', 'disco', 'yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'love', 'eighties.Director', 'KT', 'Kwak', 'done', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'CGI', 'really', 'need', 'am', 'world', 'cinema', 'fan', 'so', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'not', 'par', 'other', 'Asian', 'indeed', 'Korean', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'done', 'engender', 'empathy', 'characters', 'aside', 'was', 'satisfying', '113', 'minutes', 'title', 'definition', 'discover', 'what', 'friend', 'being', 'long', 'close', 'companion', 'like', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'first', 'foray', 'area', 'cinema', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'would', 'go', 'Brotherhood']",Friend
