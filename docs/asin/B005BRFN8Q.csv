1452713,A91BK8S5QH98K,B005BRFN8Q,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[6, 13]","The plot of this film centers around two former high school rivals who once again live in the same town, when Mitch Bright, portrayed by Daniel Baldwin, returns after having ""seen the world"" by leaving Alaska and going to Berkeley and living in San Francisco.  He awes the locals by displaying his wealth, although, it turns out to be just for show as he lost his money in some bad investments.  The local boy, Mayor Dan Reed, is quite fond of the fifty year-old town's traditional Christmas Nativity display, something to which the Christphobic Mitch Bright takes offense.  So Bright soon files a complaint and all the Church versus State issues come into play.  The movie acts like it is promoting putting Christ into Christmas by taking the viewpoint that it is all about Christians doing for others, which is partially true, but its emphasis on overlooking political activism is actually a red herring.  As while yes Christians should do for others, they don't need to let themselves be shoved into the background by letting people like Mitch Bright always be victorious.  Which is why this film gets no more than a one star rating from me.  I admit the two male leads do a fantastic job of conveying their animosity onscreen, so some of the acting is quite impressive.  The teenage love story seemed superfluous to the plot.  And the film could have had a lovely ending if they had showed the Nativity display back in the city square, but instead they leave it alongside a remote highway, even though, in the end Bright comes around and withdraws his complaint.",1,"Almost, but not quite.",1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,1566,"['plot', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'rivals', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'live', 'same', 'town', 'when', 'Mitch', 'Bright', 'portrayed', 'Daniel', 'Baldwin', 'having', 'seen', 'world', 'leaving', 'Alaska', 'going', 'Berkeley', 'living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'locals', 'displaying', 'wealth', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'show', 'lost', 'money', 'bad', 'investments', 'local', 'boy', 'Mayor', 'Dan', 'Reed', 'quite', 'fond', 'fifty', 'year-old', 'town', 'traditional', 'Christmas', 'Nativity', 'display', 'something', 'Christphobic', 'Mitch', 'Bright', 'offense', 'So', 'Bright', 'soon', 'complaint', 'Church', 'versus', 'State', 'issues', 'come', 'play', 'movie', 'promoting', 'putting', 'Christ', 'Christmas', 'taking', 'viewpoint', 'Christians', 'doing', 'others', 'partially', 'true', 'emphasis', 'overlooking', 'political', 'activism', 'actually', 'red', 'herring', 'yes', 'Christians', 'should', 'do', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'let', 'be', 'shoved', 'background', 'letting', 'people', 'Mitch', 'Bright', 'always', 'be', 'victorious', 'Which', 'why', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'admit', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'conveying', 'animosity', 'onscreen', 'acting', 'quite', 'impressive', 'teenage', 'love', 'story', 'seemed', 'superfluous', 'plot', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'lovely', 'ending', 'had', 'showed', 'Nativity', 'display', 'back', 'city', 'square', 'instead', 'leave', 'remote', 'highway', 'even', 'end', 'Bright', 'around', 'withdraws', 'complaint']",Christmas with a Capital C

And although it is certainly brought up in the movie, the message isn't that you should say Merry Christmas instead of just Happy Holidays.  In fact, several of the key characters point out that, while the holiday is certainly about Jesus and originated as a celebration of His birth, concentrating too much on which phrase people use can take your mind off other issues that His followers should be interested in.  The Christians in this small town square off against a ""villain"" who has returned to his home town after many years and begins causing trouble.

Suffice it to say that while every cast member does an outstanding job, Nancy Stafford stands out and I believe would have been up for an Academy Award.  Her thoughtful observations are a center piece in this film and I will be urging all of our friends to purchase it on November 1. We even asked for one day delivery so we could begin showings as quickly as possible.

Excellent actors in a good Christian tale written by Andrea Gyertson Nasfell. A story with a moral meaning, but don't confuse that with the politics also included.There's teenage romance, a Mayor's race, a ski race, and Mitch (Daniel Baldwin, yes Alec's bro) returns after 20 years to oppose the long-time Mayor's (Ted McGinley) reelection as well as City Hall's use of a ""Merry Christmas"" banner and an antique local Alaskan's nativity carving. More than the ""Merry Christmas"" vs ""Happy Holiday"" issue is a greater theme of ""goodwill to all men"" & ""peace on Earth.""Two magnificent aspects shine like tree-topping angels.First is the filming location of Seward, Alaska; converted to Trapper Falls, small town of 4000 and home of moose burgers. Scenery is breathtaking. Local Alaskan's know that.Second is an absolute show-stopper performance in a scene when the Mayor's brother, Greg (Brad Stine-Christian comedian) explains the Christ birth story to 3 youth. He rolls, an animated Christian Christmas fanatic, ranting like Robin Williams, and stealing the best segment of the entire film. It was intentional, as much of the segment was taken from his stand-up comedy routine, written into the film by the writer.The film ends with the spectacular scene of the life-size hand carved town's cr&egrave;che (now privately owned and displayed) set up with Alaskan mountains as a backdrop. Credits roll including ""It's Called Christmas with a Capital C"" music by Go Fish, a song the movie was based upon.The 81 min. film does have SUBTITLES and a Dove Approval.Bonus stuff: Commentary option; Behind the Scenes-24 min; Highway 101 Bio-8 min; Highway 101 Music video; 6 Trailers.Highly recommended Christian Family Film viewing. A keeper to watch every year. Although the constitutional question of City Hall Christmas political correctness is included; look instead to the greater story of reaching out to others at Christmas, even to a life-long rival.
