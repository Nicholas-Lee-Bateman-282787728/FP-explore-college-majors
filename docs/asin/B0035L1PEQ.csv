Every episode is on the first disc along with the special features. It includes deleted scenes and bonus interviews. Also, it includes the extended version of the first episode that only aired once. The second disc features Keeping Up With The Kardashians: The Wedding special along with deleted scenes from the episode. Promos for Keeping Up With The Kardashians seasons 1 and 2 are on the DVD before the menu. The DVD also includes an ad inside for the second season along with an episode list with summaries of each episode. The only bad things about this release is that it is censored and the theme song is changed. It features just instrumental music instead of ""I'm In Miami Trick"".

Has deleted scenes & some of Khloe's ""Khloe After Dark"" interviews.BUT, NOT UNCUT.  CURSE WORDS ARE STILL NOT HEARD.Now, we should all agree that Khloe & Lamar's weeding is the 1st episode of the 4th season of ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians"" and should be included in that DVD package.  Only reason I can figure they put it as part of this DVD package because of the only 8 episodes.The highlight of the season was Kourtney & Scott getting back together which resulted in Mason.I did NOT like the episode #7 Land of the Lost.  Out of gas in the Ever Glades.OK, I complained  about this in my review of the DVD for the 2cd season of ""Keeping Up With The Kardashians"".  WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THESE CHEAP DVD CASES WITH HOLES IN THEM?  CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP.  How about the DVD's could get damaged.

They just didn't catch my interest although I'd heard about the tape with Kim and Ray J. But for some odd reason my television was on E! and I didn't feel like changing the station so I ended up watching a marathon of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians."" To this day, I don't understand why there are so many slick comments about Kim. She seems all right to me, even with her tirade about getting a Bentley. I don't care for Khloe too much after that incredibly insensitive episode with her mother who has incontinence. After that episode I was done with Khloe on any show, including Khloe & Lamar. Kourtney seems pretty OK except for when she's around Scott. Then she becomes incredibly annoying, specifically that nasal voice and dry sense of humor. But even though I like those two sisters the least of all, I can't deny that this show is pretty entertaining. I was truly surprised with the kiss between Khloe and Terrence J. This season turned out to be pretty all right regardless of me not caring for these two sisters on ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians.""
