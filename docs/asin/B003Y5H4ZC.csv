1371679,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003Y5H4ZC,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","I totally understand why Tyler Perry wanted to make this film.  Considered one of the more popular Black filmmakers today (what has this world come to), Perry has been searching for that special project that would give him the respect he desires.  I mean, he's RICH, but no one really takes him seriously, and he wants that BAD.Putting my initial reservations on hold, I have to admit that this project seemed promising.  I don't know what Tyler Perry's hold is on the Black community, but it seems like every Black actor or actress goes to him for work.  So, with a dramatic prose and a slew of fantastic actresses, Tyler Perry set off to make what promised to be his grand opus.  To think that he wasn't praying to Oprah for an Oscar is plain silly.  You know that every day of production was an inch closer to that podium (in his mind).And why not?I'll tell you why not; Tyler Perry couldn't handle this film.  The source material (the play `For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf' by Ntozake Shange) calls for an imaginative director, someone with vision and personality.  I don't know if Perry was afraid of screwing this all up, but he approached this in such a straightforward and unimaginative manner that it lost all of the `specialness' it could have had.  I'll say this; the opening sequence with Anika Noni Rose dancing, with the soft pastels and the stirring music, was superb.  From that point forward the film started a steep decline.  The play, being broken out into 20 poems, really needed an artistic display in order to retain its poignancy.  By approaching the film in such a realistic manner it added a layer of camp to the film that just didn't fit.  The poems are just that, poems, and so when they are spoken as part of natural dialog they become somewhat disjointed from the rest of the film.  Had a more artistic director found ways to incorporate those poems within the fabric of the film, even finding ways to highlight the poems by removing them from the specific scenes, it would have shone.  If the poems had been treated like musical numbers even, removing them from the realistic dynamics of the film, it would have given the entire feel of the film a more absorbing nature.  Tyler Perry also has trouble directing dramatics.  I saw this in `Why Did I Get Married'.  He has a tendency to overdramatize things and it frays the initial realisms.  He falls into clich&eacute;s in parts (the rape scene corresponding with the opera felt very `dramatics 101') and he borders on camp in others (the window-drop scene, which is HORRIFIC, comes across like a poorly executed TV movie).  He just didn't know how to work with the elements in this film.  Also, expanding the characters from 7 to 20 took away from some character development and the actual flow of the film, making it choppy and uneven in scenes.It tends to jump around a lot.And yet, there is one dynamic of this film that really works; the actressing.  Yes, this is an actress-lovers dream come true.  The list of actresses working their magic here is nearly never ending, and while some of them don't live up to expectations, there are a few that really deliver sharp and provocative performances.  Kimberly Elise and Kerry Washington are easily the film standouts, both of them capturing the sincerity and emotional collapse of their characters.  I also thought that Phylicia Rashad was triumphant.  Janet Jackson handles her `poem' better than anyone else (it actually fits the setup rather well) and Anika Noni Rose shows us why we still remember her `Dreamgirls' performance; she drips charisma and charm.  Some actresses don't fare as well.  Loretta Devine becomes a caricature and Thandie Newton is choppy and uneven and over-the-top.  Tessa Thompson's poetry reading was atrociously handled (one of the worst scenes in the film) and while Janet Jackson nailed her poem, her overall performance felt like a poorly realized rip off of Streep's `Devil Wears Prada' performance.  Whoopi Goldberg had a very hard character to sell, but she does it to a degree, and the way her poem was weaved in with Newton's was possibly the most artistic moment in the entire film.Why couldn't every poem been given such sharp attention?In the end, `For Colored Girls' had promise, and it does carry some weight, but it just isn't handled in ways that really lives up to that promise.  Aside from some very fine performances, the film falls apart under the directors lacking.",3,Washed out...,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,4486,"['totally', 'understand', 'why', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'Considered', 'one', 'more', 'popular', 'Black', 'filmmakers', 'today', 'what', 'world', 'come', 'Perry', 'been', 'searching', 'special', 'project', 'would', 'give', 'respect', 'mean', 'RICH', 'one', 'really', 'seriously', 'BAD.Putting', 'initial', 'reservations', 'hold', 'have', 'admit', 'project', 'seemed', 'promising', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'hold', 'Black', 'community', 'Black', 'actor', 'actress', 'work', 'So', 'dramatic', 'prose', 'slew', 'fantastic', 'actresses', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'set', 'off', 'make', 'what', 'promised', 'be', 'grand', 'opus', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'praying', 'Oprah', 'Oscar', 'plain', 'silly', 'know', 'day', 'production', 'was', 'inch', 'closer', 'podium', 'mind', '.And', 'why', 'not', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'not', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'film', 'source', 'material', 'play', 'Colored', 'Girls', 'Who', 'Have', 'Considered', 'Suicide', 'When', 'Rainbow', 'Is', 'Enuf', 'Ntozake', 'Shange', 'imaginative', 'director', 'someone', 'vision', 'personality', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Perry', 'was', 'afraid', 'screwing', 'up', 'approached', 'such', 'straightforward', 'unimaginative', 'manner', 'lost', 'specialness', 'could', 'have', 'had', ""'ll"", 'say', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'dancing', 'soft', 'pastels', 'stirring', 'music', 'was', 'superb', 'point', 'forward', 'film', 'started', 'steep', 'decline', 'play', 'being', 'broken', 'out', '20', 'poems', 'really', 'needed', 'artistic', 'display', 'order', 'retain', 'poignancy', 'approaching', 'film', 'realistic', 'manner', 'added', 'layer', 'camp', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'poems', 'are', 'just', 'poems', 'so', 'when', 'are', 'spoken', 'part', 'natural', 'dialog', 'become', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'rest', 'film', 'Had', 'more', 'artistic', 'director', 'found', 'ways', 'incorporate', 'poems', 'fabric', 'film', 'even', 'finding', 'ways', 'highlight', 'poems', 'removing', 'specific', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'shone', 'poems', 'had', 'been', 'treated', 'musical', 'numbers', 'even', 'removing', 'realistic', 'dynamics', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'entire', 'feel', 'film', 'more', 'absorbing', 'nature', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'also', 'trouble', 'directing', 'dramatics', 'saw', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'tendency', 'overdramatize', 'things', 'initial', 'realisms', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'parts', 'rape', 'scene', 'corresponding', 'opera', 'felt', 'very', 'dramatics', '101', 'camp', 'others', 'window-drop', 'scene', 'HORRIFIC', 'poorly', 'executed', 'TV', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'work', 'elements', 'film', 'Also', 'expanding', 'characters', '7', '20', 'took', 'away', 'character', 'development', 'actual', 'flow', 'film', 'making', 'choppy', 'uneven', 'scenes.It', 'tends', 'jump', 'around', 'lot.And', 'yet', 'one', 'dynamic', 'film', 'really', 'actressing', 'Yes', 'actress-lovers', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'list', 'actresses', 'working', 'magic', 'here', 'nearly', 'never', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'are', 'few', 'really', 'deliver', 'sharp', 'provocative', 'performances', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'are', 'easily', 'film', 'standouts', 'capturing', 'sincerity', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'characters', 'also', 'thought', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'was', 'triumphant', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'poem', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'actually', 'setup', 'rather', 'well', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'why', 'still', 'remember', 'Dreamgirls', 'performance', 'charisma', 'charm', 'actresses', 'do', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'caricature', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'choppy', 'uneven', 'over-the-top', 'Tessa', 'Thompson', 'poetry', 'reading', 'was', 'atrociously', 'handled', 'one', 'worst', 'scenes', 'film', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'nailed', 'poem', 'overall', 'performance', 'felt', 'poorly', 'realized', 'rip', 'Streep', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'performance', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'had', 'very', 'hard', 'character', 'sell', 'degree', 'way', 'poem', 'was', 'weaved', 'Newton', 'was', 'possibly', 'most', 'artistic', 'moment', 'entire', 'film.Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'poem', 'been', 'given', 'such', 'sharp', 'attention', 'end', 'Colored', 'Girls', 'had', 'promise', 'carry', 'weight', 'just', ""n't"", 'handled', 'ways', 'really', 'up', 'promise', 'Aside', 'very', 'fine', 'performances', 'film', 'apart', 'directors', 'lacking']",N/A
1371680,AQ4FI9JSN26JV,B003Y5H4ZC,AUBrown07,"[8, 10]","I saw the movie in theaters and I must say I was sorely disappointed with this movie. I've read the poetry, which was written in the 1970's and reflected upon a much different time and placement for Black women. I understand Tyler Perry's want to re-invent and structure the story for this day and age, but I wasn't impressed by any means. I was actually quite saddened at how naive and completely victimized every female character in this movie was. I mean one female after the other seemed to walk directly into a fire pit and then seem to look dauntingly for sympathy. Speaking as a Black woman, I found no way to relate to ANY of these women. A mother too blind to see the cancer of a man she's living and allowing to control the miserable life around her for which she later seeks sympathy for his antics; A woman desperately seeking male attention that she continually allows a man to dictate when she receives his love because she's sharing him with another woman; A woman who is so aptly blinded by a man's slight charm that she becomes his rape victim; A woman grasping so tightly to power and control around her because she's lost control in her love life and wakes up with AIDS; A girl who becomes sexually promiscuous before her time and ends up pregnant; Her sister who uses her body as a means of ""trade"" to make sense of being sexually abused years earlier; Then you have Phylicia Rashad & Whoopi Goldberg's whose story lines seemed to be dropped in more as product placement than anything. Then you have the seventh woman who cannot have children and that seems to be her only problem, which compared to the other women really can be solved. I was appalled at this film and I would not buy it or ever watch it again, the depictions don't resonate ""Empowerment"" but shear and utter contempt because as Black women I believe we're supposed to not only be smarter than this, but a whole lot better than this.

""Charlie""","[8, 13]","I've never been the biggest Tyler Perry fan simply because he does not have the technical training, such as writing and directing, that most of his contemporaries have, yet Blacks in particular settle for the mediocrity he presents and laud it just because the characters look like them and are relatable or entertaining, or even because he is Black and the need to support him because there just aren't enough like him out there in the genre.  Well, I don't.  He doesn't measure to the likes of those who brought us Black ensemble films like ""Love Jones"" and ""The Best Man.""  I'll never knock his hustle--he's done good for himself by far--but I never saw the potential...until this film.Aesthtically, the film was beautifully shot.  That initially grabbed my attention.  The locations popped, and the settings complimented the actors nicely.  The writing was above his standards, but I guess I'll give it to him even though it was an adaptation, so the script really required little on his part.  His ""work"" on the script does however shine in some missteps, such as Janet Jackson's character, the Lady in Red, from her poor imitation of Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly from ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" to most of the paultry storyline.  He only redeems himself in the final confrontation scene between her and her husband which was so intense words just can't describe it.  The actresses were phenomenally cast.  Though I get tired of seeing Loretta Devine playing the same role over and over again and fear that she probably has become type cast for the latter part of her career, she delivered like only she could.  Janet Jackson is not that great of an actress, maybe prior to and including Poetic Justice, but the majority of the cast outdid her, and for the life of me I wish Perry would stop giving her top billing as if she is a box office draw--in her arena (music) yes, but not in film.  She hasn't earned it yet.  Thandie Newton's accent was jarring at times in her portrayal of the Lady in Orange, but she seemed to be more believeable than the thought of Mariah Carey, who dropped out, in the role.  Macy Gray seemed more fitting to play Whoopi Goldberg's Lady in White and vice versa as Rose, but they were good nonetheless.  Phylicia Rashad was equally effective as a strong supporting cast member, but it was Kimberly Elise as the Lady in Brown that stole the movie effortlessly with her acting.  If ever this movie is to get any kind of Oscar nomination, this woman deserves to be recognized.Overall, I was impressed.  I didn't come into this film with high expectations, but left feeling that Perry actually was in the right frame of mind when he handled Ntozake Shange's play.  And I felt that for once he truly used his position, power, and product to send a real message to his audience.  I still felt there was a weakness in the film's script, but it was a very endearing piece of work, the first in a good while for Black films.  For whatever reason Perry decided to commit to this project, be it a chance to get some Oscar recognizition and for once be taken seriously as a writer/producer or what, I hope he learns from this experience and builds on it.  The potential is there, and this was a worthy testament of that.",4,"For Perry, a Major Improvement and Step in the Right Direction",1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,3243,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'biggest', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fan', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'technical', 'training', 'such', 'writing', 'directing', 'most', 'contemporaries', 'have', 'yet', 'Blacks', 'particular', 'settle', 'mediocrity', 'laud', 'just', 'characters', 'look', 'are', 'relatable', 'entertaining', 'even', 'Black', 'need', 'support', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'out', 'there', 'genre', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'measure', 'likes', 'who', 'brought', 'Black', 'ensemble', 'films', 'Love', 'Jones', 'Best', 'Man', ""'ll"", 'never', 'knock', 'hustle', 'done', 'good', 'far', 'never', 'saw', 'potential', 'film.Aesthtically', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'initially', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'locations', 'popped', 'settings', 'complimented', 'actors', 'nicely', 'writing', 'was', 'standards', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'give', 'even', 'was', 'adaptation', 'script', 'really', 'required', 'little', 'part', 'work', 'script', 'however', 'shine', 'missteps', 'such', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'character', 'Lady', 'Red', 'poor', 'imitation', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Miranda', 'Priestly', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'most', 'paultry', 'storyline', 'only', 'final', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'husband', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'words', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'actresses', 'were', 'phenomenally', 'cast', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'playing', 'same', 'role', 'over', 'again', 'fear', 'probably', 'become', 'type', 'cast', 'latter', 'part', 'career', 'delivered', 'only', 'could', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'not', 'great', 'actress', 'maybe', 'prior', 'including', 'Poetic', 'Justice', 'majority', 'cast', 'outdid', 'life', 'wish', 'Perry', 'would', 'stop', 'giving', 'top', 'billing', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'arena', 'music', 'yes', 'not', 'film', ""n't"", 'earned', 'yet', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'accent', 'was', 'jarring', 'times', 'portrayal', 'Lady', 'Orange', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'believeable', 'thought', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'who', 'dropped', 'out', 'role', 'Macy', 'Gray', 'seemed', 'more', 'fitting', 'play', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Lady', 'White', 'vice', 'versa', 'Rose', 'were', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'was', 'equally', 'effective', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'member', 'was', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Lady', 'Brown', 'stole', 'movie', 'effortlessly', 'acting', 'ever', 'movie', 'get', 'kind', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'woman', 'be', 'recognized.Overall', 'was', 'impressed', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'film', 'high', 'expectations', 'left', 'feeling', 'Perry', 'actually', 'was', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'when', 'handled', 'Ntozake', 'Shange', 'play', 'felt', 'once', 'truly', 'used', 'position', 'power', 'product', 'send', 'real', 'message', 'audience', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'weakness', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'endearing', 'piece', 'work', 'first', 'good', 'while', 'Black', 'films', 'reason', 'Perry', 'decided', 'commit', 'project', 'be', 'chance', 'get', 'Oscar', 'recognizition', 'once', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'writer/producer', 'what', 'hope', 'experience', 'builds', 'potential', 'there', 'was', 'worthy', 'testament']",N/A

1371697,A3HCCW3SPK41VG,B003Y5H4ZC,Darius Williamson,"[3, 4]","In 2011, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who never heard of playwright-turned-producer Tyler Perry, or his iconic creation, Madea.  After several years' worth of successful screenplays, Perry debuted with Diary of a Mad Black Woman (2005), a big screen adaptation of his similarly named play.  Hot off the heels of his box office success, Perry churned out several other movies, Madea or otherwise, and TV-based side projects (i.e., Meet the Browns and House of Payne).  But despite Perry's accomplishments, some critics and moviegoers think his talents as a writer/director are limited.It's hard to disagree.  With few exceptions, Perry's narratives follow a common, clich&eacute;d path: the trifling black man making the heroine's life hell, the hooker with a heart of gold, the upstanding black man who's a beacon of hope for the heroine, the comeuppance of said trifling black man, and the holier-than-thou Christians who provide sage knowledge to the younger, feral generation.  Perry's films often have the subtlety of a Lifetime movie, with all the preachiness and unintentional hilarious abuse scenes that comes with it.  Even though Perry's presence provides material for a starved demographic - black Christian women - it offers little for everyone else.Perry's latest movie, an adaptation of Ntozake Shange's For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When The Rainbow Is Enuf, tackles these issues head on with a harrowing narrative of eight Brooklyn women struggling to survive through their messy lives.  In several ways, it feels like Paul Haggis's Crash, only with black females facing sexism as opposed to ripple effect racism.  Personal tragedies afflict each protagonist, whether past, present or future, and they affect the lives of the people around them, whether directly or indirectly.  By the movie's climax, most of these characters settle for a bittersweet end to their journeys, bruised and exhausted.To Perry's credit, making a movie based off a fairly obscure collection of 1970s black feminist poems takes guts.  It's a step forward to slake his fledging artistry of his earlier films.  Perry freeing his own inner demons also fueled his desire, and at times, that intense passion emerges.  There are even some scenes, at least on the technical side, that are worth applause.  To soften the horror of one character's rape, it was juxtaposed with a serene opera scene.  As a filmmaker, Perry shows improvement.Alas, For Colored Girls shares many of Crash's flaws, along with its own unique faults.  For one, having the same eight or so characters run into each other in New York, a city that's always crowded with hundreds of inhabitants, feels contrived after a while.  Likewise, viewers have to suspend disbelief that these females are experiencing a lifetime worth of catastrophes within (presumably) two weeks.  Perry choosing to include Shange's poems into the film, while welcome in theater, does more harm than good here.  In the midst of a traumatizing experience, having characters recite Shange's monologues grinds the action to a halt, and don't flow with the characters' natural dialogue.  After about the third or fourth poem, it's too tempting to ignore them entirely.Some of Perry's bad habits also reappear at instances, like the lack of nuance with the ladies' lives.  Any chance of proper character development became compromised with so many characters shuffled through at any given moment.  While this flaw isn't as noticeable here as in Perry's other films, For Colored Girls being devoid of any real complexity makes even these women's extreme difficulties feel surprisingly shallow.  One cringe worthy example involved a sexual awareness instructor informing one character about how to take care of herself after her husband infected her with an STD.  It sounded like a laughable PSA, and added nothing to the story.  Elsewhere, the black males are simplistically portrayed, whether their behavior's honorable or despicable (mostly deplorable).  Instead of Perry giving them multi-layered reasons for their personalities, he coasts by with damning stereotypes, like the down low brother or the womanizer who drifts between two women.  While I won't claim that the mostly un-heroic male cast was Perry's thinly veiled attack towards black men, I wish there was more balance than just Harper Hill's noble detective.The only thing that kept For Colored Girls from falling apart was the wonderful performances by the actresses involved.  Phylicia Rashad, with her character being the anti-Mrs. Huxtable, and Kimberly Elise, as the mother of two kids and the wife of a PTSD war vet, were especially good.  Conversely, Janet Jackson, usually a delight on the screen, looked lifeless at times; even taking account the deadened expressiveness of her character, a sardonic magazine mogul.  Everyone else was more-or-less superb, reflecting the raw wounds that still sting during their characters' individual breaking points.  Too bad Perry marginalized those moments by awkwardly injecting Shange's poetry and/or surrounding them with treacly melodrama.At times, For Colored Girls flashed moments worth real discussion.  Near the end, hearing the women dissecting the endless excuses men have told them for too many years was an eye opener for this [male] viewer.  Several scenes suggest how even women's lack of solidarity exacerbated the problems depicted in the movie.  A better filmmaker would have exposed that subject with deftness.  Instead, with Perry's vision, For Colored Girls rings hollow as social commentary.",2,Perry's erratic direction hampers a potentially great film,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,5573,"['2011', ""'d"",

At length and last we finally have decent black directors but they still continue to churn out the same clich&eacute;d stuff year after year.  Honestly, it's little wonder any black women get married at all.  By all accounts we appear to be damaged goods and no one goes out intentionally looking for damaged goods; I wouldn't.

Can we see movies of black people taking romantic trips to Europe and drinking latte's in Rome.  There is drama in other communities.

First and foremost ,is the manner Tyler Perry handles these women - more like vessels for ideas and messages instead of fully fleshed characters . All nine women in "" For Colored Girls "" go through various horrible situations : rape , child molestation , physical abuse , infidelity and the list goes on and on . The movie has enough material for ten weepy filmfests all cornered though , in it's 133 minutes .I have heard many of the talented , ambitious actresses saying in interviews how much the film has touched them and how special it was for them . Im glad they connected so deep with the material . It's a pity that what reaches the screen is so uneven and doesn't do justice to their efforts . The wonderful Kerry Washighton is totally wasted in a thankless role of a social worker . Same goes for Anika Noni Rose who plays dance instructor Yasmine . Janet Jackson as Jo gets more time on screen , does not seem comfortable as the other,more experienced co-stars in the dramatic scenes yet its interesting to see the singer-songwritter , whose career has been rather uneven the last decade , try something like this . Best of all are Phylicia Rashad as Gilda and Kimberly Elise as Crystal , the wounded heart of the film .What i probably think bothered me the most is how eager the director was for tears from his stars . All the monologues fail miserably and the oscar-baiting scenes are so many with so few breaths for the viewer inbetween , its impossible not to feel fed up . Minutes - no , seconds after Yasmine's tearful confession after her rape comes Nyla's delirium about her abortion . The director doesn't seem to know what the word restrain means .

1371718,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003Y5H4ZC,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Tyler Perry has performed a little miracle in transferring Ntozake Shange's exquisite play ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" into an opened up and expanded film.  The dialogue still is deeply embedded in Shange's poetry but the narrative Perry added makes the stage experience a flowing cinematic story: the result is a powerful film that happens to be populated by some of the finest actresses of today.The plat cannot be faithfully summarized, as it is a cluster of vignettes of ten women in crisis. Each character is given the name of a color of the rainbow, but they also have real names and the men in their off track lives actually do appear.  It would be unfair to single out any one of these actresses as best because their roles are all different and make demands on the actresses in different ways.  Whoopie Goldberg is the religiously inclined mother of Thandie Newton (a woman of physical needs that cannot be satisfied despite nightly change of partners) and Tessa Thompson (a high school girl with aspirations crushed by an unwanted pregnancy); Janet Jackson is a bitter, wealthy magazine editor married to the Down Low Omari Hardwick; Loretta Devine is a community service giver in a relationship with the undependable Richard Lawson; Kimberly Elise (breathtakingly magnificent!) is paired with the war-torn PTSD alcoholic and abusive Michael Ealy; Kerry Washington works for child services despite her infertility in her marriage to Hill Harper; Anika Noni Rose is a lovely innocent dance teacher brutally treated by Khalil Kain; Phylicia Rashad is the tenement house manager who is the central mother confessor to her tenants.  How these women's lives are interconnected is fascinating as a story/screenplay: how these gifted actresses deliver the poetry of Shange is beyond anyone's expectations.There are many issues this film deals with - single mother, violence against women, death, loss, partner abuse, etc - and each of the issues is poignant and keenly defined and acted.  How this film slipped under the line for awards is anyone's guess.  It is not to be missed.

1371719,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B003Y5H4ZC,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[1, 3]","This movie, based on a play with a similar name, which I saw in the 80s, appeared on TV last night. This updated more modern version (for all of the obvious reasons, it keeps being resurrected), has slickly trimmed away some of the rough edges and returned with a flourish into a new repackaged reincarnated ""Oprah-Tyler Perry like"" genre. Essentially it is an intra-tribal intra-gender conversation among black women about ""the problem?"" (Remember the problem? -- as it was discussed in: ""What's Love Got to do with it?,"" Waiting to Exhale,"" Color Purple,"" and ""Precious?"" to name just the most obvious ones?).My assessment of them is that by constantly harping on the same exaggerated but disingenuous theme (to the exclusion of all others): that it is black men's irresponsibility that is responsible for all of the woes of black women, altogether constitutes a kind of emotional blackmail within the black tribe. It does this by introducing a crippling threat of a fifth rail or a fifth column into the ""black-on-black internecine warfare"" in our already sick racist world. Only this time, the war crimes are ""thought crimes"" being committed by black women -- first against their intended target, us, black men, but then also against the larger and unintended targets of the black race as a whole, as well as the unmistakable and unavoidable boomerang effects that rebound back to black women themselves?In barely disguised form, this movie, as an integral part of the new Oprah-Tyler Perry inspired genre, appears as little more than another theater of the emotionally hysterical, a revisited sick and absurd anti-black male trope. As such, it amounts to yet another form of the intentional ""emotional"" and continued criminal profiling of, and attempted destruction of, black men's characters,"" sold as the new black woman propaganda. But this time the attack is occurring from within the black family itself. And in this sense, tragically this Oprah-Perry genre strategically links up with other ""easy"" racist anti-black male tropes within American society. That is to say, it links up with those whose sold and well known purpose is to openly and unabashedly further darken and denigrate the black man's already much maligned reputation and character.The cheap melodramas mentioned in the first paragraph above as well as in this movie, all fit comfortably into the already prepared American family album of the four-cornered mainstream race/sex Kabuki dance. One album, the thickest of them all is labeled ""black male bashing;"" the other is labeled ""black female victimology."" The two that go unmentioned but are ever present in the subtext are: The ""Alpha Male white Hero,"" and the ""Alpha Female White Sex Goddess."" Even though these last two corners of the dance are not mentioned directly, they both serve as the unmistakable psychological backdrop to this sick and cheap faux drama.Through this movie, black women (plus Tyler Perry, whose sexuality is of a floating and indeterminate nature) want the world to believe that ""bashing the black man"" and ""black women playing the role of intra-racial victim"" are but different sides of the same coin. The not so well hidden agenda running along in the subtext being: ""Aunt Jemima,"" is still pandering to the racist white sentiment as she once did with such great skill while in the ""Big House"" during slavery. But apparently the world is no longer buying this Oprah/Tyler Perry/Ester Rolle trope?At least not from what we see in the most recent Pew Report on cross-racial dating. There we can see that the Oprah-Tyler sanctioned sport of ""black male bashing"" apparently is not having the desired effect at all because black men who date women other than black women are doing quite well despite being constantly reviled and castigated by their own women? In fact, black men with a college education are about seven times more likely to marry outside the race than similarly situated black women? Sounds to me like they are being rapidly driven away to other women?At some point Oprah-led black women must ""woman-up"" and (Perry must ""man-up,"" or ""what-up"") and realize that the Oprah-Tyler strategy, deployed to the hilt in this movie, is not working (and not even privately for Oprah herself) and learn to stand on their own two feet in the open market, without leaning back on ""Aunt Jemima,"" ""black male bashing"" and ""being last years white woman"" tropes, as props to advance their insecurity driven causes and agendas. More importantly, there is a very definite boomerang effect from this incessant ""harping for false sympathy"" on grounds of ""black male bashing:"" It apparently causes eligible men from all races to think twice about dating or marrying black women? Anyone who doubts this, should just scan the web, or read the Pew Report.At least this is what the recent Pew study shows: that men the world over see (for a whole host of reasons seen everywhere out on the web) black women as being the least desirable women in the world to date or marry. And sadly, these men are voting with their feet. Indeed, why would any man want a woman from a group where she incessantly bashes the men of her own race? As an example of how it should be done. It is well known that Chinese and Korean women do not much care for Chinese and Korean men either, but has anyone ever heard a Chinese woman or a Korean woman say an unkind word about Chinese or Korean men in public, or launch a national propaganda campaign of movies and dramas to rail against them? (I don't think so?)The two-pronged message of this movie could not be more unsubtle and in your face. It is that: (1) Black men are the ""Kryptonite"" of the world, not just of American society: all women (not just black women) should beware of them and thus be forewarned, as there is an ego-destroying, emasculating, sexual predator let loose on American society and the world: it is called the generic black male? The Ku Klux Klan could not ask for a more active ally than a group with this message. Plus, who could miss the larger but cheapest subtext: that black women are still trying to strip us from the herd so that we are exclusively reserved sexually only for them. Otherwise, who is going to be jumping to date black women, if not that old dog they have succeeded in crippling, the black man?As this movie so graphically depicts him, the black man is a culprit like the world has never seen before or will ever see again. In this movie, his disguises include that of a quite unassuming but slick and brutal rapist, a deranged double baby-killer, a father who engages in incest with his own daughters, a mentally-deranged psychopath who kills his own baby by throwing her off the balcony, plus an assortment of alcoholics, drug abusers, pimps, wife-beaters, and ""down-low"" homosexuals who purposefully transmit HIV and other venereal diseases. This is the way the black woman separates the black man from the herd so that he is available only to her sexually. Some kind of sick strategy wouldn't you say?Black women who wantonly convey such damagingly graphic images must be reminded that the men they characterize in such vile ways cannot exclude their own fathers, brothers, uncles, sons and husbands, and would also include as well, the current President of the USA? For the distinctions made here are anything but subtle; they are sweeping and done with malice and deep painful vengeance. They do not leave much room for parsing out the good black man from the bad. Presumably if such exclusions are to be made at all, they will have to be made only in one-on-one situations.The companion and complementary message is (2) that black women are the self-declared heroes in a tragic black-on-black drama of their own making, a drama whose truths, narratives and facts they alone control. The problem however is that even though they construct, write the scripts for, and control the facts of the narrative, they never ""own"" it or ""take responsibility"" for how it evolves, or for any of its bad outcomes? And as is usual for them, black women (like God herself) take credit for all of the good and hide from all the responsibility for any of the bad. They are the only ones in their own self-made dramas who are not responsible for the actions that take place within the script that they have alone created?How can this be? If we look carefully at the multi-pronged (but facile) plot of this drama and take the resulting vignettes at face value, at the very least it makes the self-serving portrait that black women paint of themselves confusing and contradictory? For here we see that the black woman sees herself as guileless, guiltless, non-manipulative, un-controlling, chaste, sweet, innocent but still the virginal cardboard cutouts of ""last year's white woman,""a savvy woman who is constantly allowing herself to be tricked by the same old vile black male devil?"" Onto this self-flattering cardboard damsel in distress, we see reflected back and grafted onto her the rules, values, habits and desires of the same prototype: ""last year's white woman"" -- the black woman's alter ego, her double, her doppelg&auml;nger, or exact racial counterpart.If one reads the tea leaves in the subtext of the mulit-pronged plot to this movie carefully, it is easy enough to see that it is a cheap melodrama taken from the TV sitcom playbook of ""last year's white woman?"" It leads one to only one conclusion: Today's black woman's reality is just the left over debris of the TV reality shows of last year's white woman -- yearning to get rehearsed and played out in real time as contemporary black woman reality? And, as is so expertly shown here, the black woman's reality is nothing more and nothing less than that: a sad rehearsal of last year's ""White woman TV reality show.""At its worse black woman reality is a ""piggyback reality"" steeped in imagined white women fantasy: a loose collage of overly sexualized and slutty images, leaning heavily towards the haughty and glamorous, glittery but always empty of any substance or humanity whatsoever, but always consistent with white pop-culture and reality TV norms. In one scene the sisters were actually angry that black women were not being chosen to be ""the dancing hos"" in a hip-hop video? (Jeez, please give me a frigging break?) And at its best, black women reality is just a cheap imitation and caricature of high-white society - overly moralized but a plasticized TV version of it hyped with self-made Aunt Jemima delusions and psychology laid-on.The saddest part of all this is that from this movie, one does not get a feeling that there is such a thing as a ""normal black woman,"" or even a ""normal black woman image?"" (She is always a weak Aunt Jemima, or a second hand damsel in digress, looking askance from the white woman or white man for validation?) Or even worse yet, we do not get the impression that there is even a distinctive or unique black woman humanity? (After all, Aunt Jemima's humanity is always ""on loan"" from last year's white woman?)From this movie all we see is that from top to bottom, from mother to daughter, from ""ho's"" to ""saints,"" from a modern day ""Aunt Jemima"" to ""Wall Street executives (always carrying their Teddy Bears),"" this is a ""reality show"" scavenged from the bottom of the American white woman barrel?  It is impossible to make a mistake on this point as there are multiple vignettes coming at the same cheap messages from different angles and different vantage points. The message in the subtext is as clear as the attack on black men is up front in the context: Take away last year's white woman, and there is nothing remaining of the black woman. They have bought the hype about white women hook, line and sinker.And anyway you read it, it spells cheap, cheap, cheap; empty, empty, empty; and whining, whining, whining? The question begging for the viewer to answer is this: To whom are these black women whining to? The unmistakable answer any thinking person will get is that they are whining to racist white people. Who, else? After all, is that not how Aunt Jemimas ""make their bones?""But this is not the whole psychological story. There is another level of dishonesty to the faux black woman appealed for sympathy in the subtext of this drama. It is an admission of defeat in the face of what they see as the ""Alpha Female White woman."" The black women of today, are actually in competition with their main idols, ""last year's white women."" However, they lack the courage to face the competition straight up, toe-to-toe. So instead, they adopt all of the behaviors of last years white women, making it clear that they are not in competition with ""today's white woman,"" whom they relish becoming.And thus it would not be an exaggeration of the movie's main message to suggest that the black woman's reality is almost always rooted in a quiet kind of smoldering envy of white women; and thus of a kind of ""reflected white women glory,"" as well as a reflection of their sexual desires and fantasies about money, men and wealth."" In short, judging by what is ""seen in relief"" in this drama, in the subtext, black women compose their own script of meanings and yearnings from the debris left behind by last year's white woman, meanings and yearnings that when all arranged in order and pasted together, do not quite add up to a single complete picture of a human being, not to mention of an image of a proud and heroic woman?The black woman image in this movie is a composite made up of ""black male bashing,"" ""slutty images yearning to be rich and pampered,"" ""deflected anger at their model of womanhood, last year's white woman,"" with a hefty dose of mean-spirited cattiness and ""Aunt Jemima genuflecting thrown in for good measure."" When totaled up, no matter how much they beat their fake feminist chest, this image does not a proud woman make? Where is the black woman humanity in this depiction of a psychological train wreck?How can the producers of this ""faux drama"" be so mindlessly careless as not to realize that any thinking viewer would be able to see through this tissue paper thin chest-beating pseudo-feminist bombast to the subtext of real pain that is being deflected onto the black man?  What is clearly visible in the subtext is not a picture of a heroine, even in a movie engineered by a black women author. It is a picture of a mental desexed-lesbian cripple, someone cut from a tribe that is neutered, unwanted, unloved and unvalidated. Put simply, black women have stepped into a gender quick sand on the other side of the racial divide, quicksand of their own making. Quicksand that they are now desperately trying to pull themselves out of, with the hope that it can then be used to build a new sand castle of? And they want us black men, and the whole black race to join them in this quicksand drowning ceremony.I say, no thank you. We too would prefer to go it alone. Boy what a waste of a lot of good acting, three stars for the acting.",3,A remade saga of the one-dimensional Woman?,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,14984,"['movie', 'based', 'play', 'similar', 'name',

Is the character Crystal played by Kimberly Elise that she was in abusive relationship with her boyfriend Beau Willie that part in the movie was sad when he killed those kids by throwing them out the apartment window! I blame the social worker for this cause she should've did more that she can to protect those kids and to take those kids away from Crystal and definetly away from Beau cause they wasn't safe to be around him. Another scene in the movie I thought it was sad when the Dance Teacher Yasmine got raped by this guy name Bill that she was dating. When I saw this rape scene I couldn't believe he did that to her cause he seemed such a nice and gentleman kind of guy! It goes to show us to be careful of the guys that we date and to trust them.

Overarching lesson (IMHO):  women have significant power between their legs and with the exercise of great power comes great responsibility.  this lesson does not seem to fit crystal - whose relationship should have been a movie in itself.  Unfortunately, like most Perry movies, there is wonderful emphasis on depicting the outcomes of the problem and drawing out the attendant emotional trauma, but little attention paid to the solution of it b/c this would often cast the blame on the ""victim"" and the ""victimizer"".  Because of the impact of media on the collective female psyche (especially black women) I do think it was socially irresponsible to show the blackman intentionally dropping his kids out of the window in a fit of misdirected rage b/c black women will latch on to that image and label every vet as a potential psycho (same re professional so called ""down lo"" brothers).  An implicit lesson I saw was that black women don't get the same benefit (commitment, continued respect, marriage proposal) from opening their legs as their noncoloured (white) counterparts.  The current debate is whether this disparity stems from blackness or boisterousness.  Also there is a conflict in women between being led by their emotion as opposed to the reality of the situation - the emotion seeks ""fantasy"" where none exists - many men capitalize on this frailty (with great power comes responsibility to not be led by your emotions).  Facing the reality that emotion/fantasy led decisions leads to dire consquences has a humbling effect which tends to harden women over time.

At first the story switches between the stories of the different women, but as the movie progresses these lives intersect and interact more and more often.  1. Whoopi Goldberg plays a woman who is involved in some kind of religious cult.  2, 3. Her two daughters are like night and day.  One is known for having lots of sexual encounters with men, the other is a perfect straight-A student who is college-bound.  4.  The straight-A student's teacher is another character.  5. Loretta Devine runs her own free clinic, while I think working nights in the hospital.  6. Janet Jackson plays the owner of a top fashion magazine who is fabulously wealthy.  7.  Another woman is her assistant.  8. Another character is a social worker.  9.  Phylicia Rashad is the landlady of the apartment building where several of the characters live.The movie considers rape, murder, suicide, affairs, class differences, abortion: a laundry list of humanity's horrors.  I found the plot of the movie to be dark and dismal, but it was important for the sake of this movie that it be so.  In the face of all of society's and life's tragedies, Black women must keep living, keep experiencing.  It reminded me of the violence that many, many women face just for being a woman.  It reminded me of the importance of always treating people with decency, warmth, and kindness because you really don't know who faces abuse when they go home everyday.One more thing, there is a normal movie atmosphere for much of the movie, but every 10 minutes or so one of the characters will enter into an extended poetic monologue.  I found these moments to be beautiful and poignant.  It was very different to see that in a movie; I can't think of another movie with this kind of style.

The mixture of screenplay along with the poetry from the actual book made this movie a worthwhile to watch.  While the stories are sad and depressing -- it doesn't shy away that this is what is going on with not just colored women -- but all women who have experienced alot of these lives.  Most of us can all agree, Kimberly Elise should had at least got an Oscar mention for this film (but we know how they work over at the Academy).  Janet Jackson hasn't had many movie roles in her lifetime yet when she does she's really good at it.  Whoopi Goldberg pulls off a somewhat of a modern-day version Celie, which I liked.  As for the rest of the cast they all do fine job portraying each character.  Tyler Perry's directing is also improving with every picture, which says alot about his talents overall in the world of entertainment.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[11, 15]","I was repeatedly asked to go see this movie, but it just looked too dark for me to want to see when I was in a good mood so I held off for awhile. Radio personalities said you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll smile, you'll frown, etc. I never laughed or smiled once through the entire movie on the day I went to see it, but I did enjoy it. Keep in mind that I was not familiar with the script or play before seeing this movie so my opinions are based on a naked view of just the film.Cons: The poetry slowed it down for me. The dialogue was already sufficient and kept the plot moving in a timely manner. The pauses to recite poetry that sometimes had nothing to do with the scene (ex. Yasmine played by Anika Noni Rose) made me want the actress to just be quiet. Yasmine's random poetry about loving to dance made sense in the dance studio, but there was one point when she was on a date and she just went on and on about dancing and Bill (played by Khalil Kain) was not talking at all for several minutes. On a date, shouldn't both people talk? I didn't really get to know much about him outside of the big incident. I wished his character was more developed or at least he talked to her so we knew what he was about outside of wanting to date Yasmine.With Michael Ealy's character, Beau Willie, viewers didn't have that problem. We knew he was a struggling veteran who was going through a state of depression and lashing out at his girlfriend Crystal (played by Kimberly Elise). I even understood Frank's (played by Richard Lawson) backstory with Juanita (played by Loretta Devine). The overly religious Alice (played by Whoopi Goldberg) was interesting to watch, especially with two very different daughters, Tangie (played by Thandie Newton) and Nyla (played by Tessa Thompson, who physically reminds me so much of Angela Simmons). I'm always going to be Team Phylicia Rashad in anything she does so no matter how nosey of a character she was, I loved every minute of her.The film itself dealt with rape, STDs, homosexuality, molestation, sisterhood, abortion, motherhood, dating, marriage and leadership. I've read some reviews from critics that state the movie took on too many topics. I couldn't disagree more. I think the plot neatly tied together all of these women, and in real life, everybody is not living a carbon copy of the next person's life so I get why there were so many characters. I did notice the pattern of the colors they wore, too, moreso with Janet Jackson and Loretta Devine than the others. Speaking of Janet Jackson, I loved how cold her character was compared to her music persona. She is truly showing how great of an actress she is, but then again, she was an actress first so I expect nothing better than the best. I like her playing stronger characters like she did in ""Poetic Justice"" so this was my second favorite film to see her in.Was the movie dark all the way through? Mainly. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Would I watch it again? Absolutely but I'd fast forward through most of Yasmine's scenes.

If you're looking for a ray of sunlight, you'll be hardpressed to find one in this movie.  You'll have to prepare yourself to see things that you don't want to recognize as fact. One thing that can be appreciated is the use of colorful poetry as dialogue.  The mix is pretty phenomenal- from an artistic view, however- it can be distracting if you're trying to catch every word of the dialogue.  I had to watch it several times to appreciate the detail of how things were orchestrated.

1371759,AZ4IUCJHXTUBD,B003Y5H4ZC,"uni aum Entertainment ""uni aum Entertainment""","[0, 0]","Ntozake Shange's Tony-nominated 1975 stage play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf was a landmark piece in African American literature and black feminism. Written, directed and produced by Tyler Perry, For Colored Girls film is cinematically beautiful and poetic but neither revolutionary nor enlightening. Tyler Perry's screenwriting is the weakest aspect of the film.For Colored Girls is one of the better acted Tyler Perry films due to an ensemble cast which includes Janet Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, Phylicia Rashad, Thandie Newton, Loretta Devine, Anika Noni Rose, Kimberly Elise, and Kerry Washington. Perry force conventional plots and cliches without souls into Shange's literary work.Each character gets the opportunity to burst into Shange's poetic arias. But the connective filler that Perry constructed to link the various stories amounts to a introductory course in writing. The women of this film shine, hitting strong emotional notes that ring true even when Perry's script adaptation feels false.Loretta Devine and Janet Jackson would have been better served by a stronger director. Loretta Devine delivers an earnest breathless performance that is multi-layered in that its embarassingly comical and touching.It is impressive to see Janet Jackson showcasing a new level of her acting range that doe not rely on her trademark smile nor voice. She outdoes herself here. It's not just Jackson's short haircut and traumatized eyes its also the mix of masculine hyper-competitiveness and feminine vulnerability that has always defined Jackson, and links it to the wily, lonely coldness often captured in classic Hollywood performances.Although this is Perry's most mature directorial work to-date but his script writing is flawed (as always). His adding (Whoopi Goldberg and Phylicia Rashad) characters to the script proves unnecessary. Goldberg's over-the-top portrayal of  Alice, a religious fanatic is distracting. Her best scene is the nuanced poetic duet with Thandi Newton. Rashad's nosey watching neighbor is one-note and one-dimensional. Her storyline never quite connects, so it often feels as if she's walked into the wrong movie.His Janet Jackson character is storyline is not well thought out. If she is aggressive, domineering, and confrontational as written, why would she wait (until its life-threatening) to confront her husband on things that she knew about him.Perry does not allow Kimberly Elise's Crystal to be the liberated character that she was in Shange's choreopoem, instead he renders her as a depressed and defeated drone.Singer Macy Gray's (always delivers in her acting roles) eerie cameo as a back-alley abortionist will make anyone rethink ever having unprotected sex. Macy is one brave casting decision away from a PRECIOUS Mo'Nique moment.Anika Noni Rose delievers a seething post-rape monologue that lands just on the right side of the film&#8217;s stage origins.For Colored Girls is a tour de force for Thandie Newton as Tangie in a role that was to be Mariah Carey's. Thandie is so great that its Ms. Carey did not do the role. Thandie fiercely delivers an Oscar worthy performance of a troubled, selfish sex addict that reveals levels and range that have never been so fully displayed in any of her other roles.Whatever stumbles there may be, they are offset by moments when For Colored Girls soars. Perry never solves the stage-to-screen translation problem. But the path he has chosen is as intriguing as it is irksome, and it works better than one might expect.",5,For Poetry Lovers,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,3548,"['Ntozake', 'Shange', 'Tony-nominated', '1975', 'stage', 'play', 'Colored', 'Girls', 'Who', 'Have', 'Considered', 'Suicide', 'When', 'Rainbow', 'Is', 'Enuf', 'was', 'landmark', 'piece', 'African', 'American', 'literature', 'black', 'feminism', 'Written', 'directed', 'produced', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Colored', 'Girls', 'film', 'cinematically', 'beautiful', 'poetic', 'revolutionary', 'enlightening', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'screenwriting', 'weakest', 'aspect', 'film.For', 'Colored', 'Girls', 'one', 'better', 'acted', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'films', 'due', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Perry', 'force', 'conventional', 'plots', 'cliches', 'souls', 'Shange', 'literary', 'work.Each', 'character', 'opportunity', 'burst', 'Shange', 'poetic', 'arias', 'connective', 'filler', 'Perry', 'constructed', 'link', 'various', 'stories', 'amounts', 'introductory', 'course', 'writing', 'women', 'film', 'shine', 'hitting', 'strong', 'emotional', 'notes', 'ring', 'true', 'even', 'when', 'Perry', 'script', 'adaptation', 'feels', 'false.Loretta', 'Devine', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'stronger', 'director', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'earnest', 'breathless', 'performance', 'multi-layered', 'embarassingly', 'comical', 'touching.It', 'impressive', 'see', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'showcasing', 'new', 'level', 'acting', 'range', 'not', 'rely', 'trademark', 'smile', 'voice', 'outdoes', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'Jackson', 'short', 'haircut', 'traumatized', 'eyes', 'also', 'mix', 'masculine', 'hyper-competitiveness', 'feminine', 'vulnerability', 'always', 'defined', 'Jackson', 'wily', 'lonely', 'coldness', 'often', 'captured', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'performances.Although', 'Perry', 'most', 'mature', 'directorial', 'work', 'to-date', 'script', 'writing', 'flawed', 'always', 'adding', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'characters', 'script', 'unnecessary', 'Goldberg', 'over-the-top', 'portrayal', 'Alice', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'distracting', 'best', 'scene', 'nuanced', 'poetic', 'duet', 'Thandi', 'Newton', 'Rashad', 'nosey', 'watching', 'neighbor', 'one-note', 'one-dimensional', 'storyline', 'never', 'quite', 'connects', 'often', 'walked', 'wrong', 'movie.His', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'character', 'storyline', 'not', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'aggressive', 'domineering', 'confrontational', 'written', 'why', 'would', 'wait', 'life-threatening', 'confront', 'husband', 'things', 'knew', 'him.Perry', 'not', 'allow', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Crystal', 'be', 'liberated', 'character', 'was', 'Shange', 'choreopoem', 'instead', 'depressed', 'defeated', 'drone.Singer', 'Macy', 'Gray', 'always', 'delivers', 'acting', 'roles', 'eerie', 'cameo', 'back-alley', 'abortionist', 'will', 'make', 'anyone', 'rethink', 'ever', 'having', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'Macy', 'one', 'brave', 'casting', 'decision', 'away', 'PRECIOUS', ""Mo'Nique"", 'moment.Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'seething', 'post-rape', 'monologue', 'just', 'right', 'side', 'film', '8217', 's', 'stage', 'origins.For', 'Colored', 'Girls', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'Tangie', 'role', 'was', 'be', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'Thandie', 'so', 'great', 'Ms.', 'Carey', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'role', 'Thandie', 'fiercely', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'troubled', 'selfish', 'sex', 'addict', 'levels', 'range', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'fully', 'displayed', 'other', 'roles.Whatever', 'stumbles', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'offset', 'moments', 'when', 'Colored', 'Girls', 'soars', 'Perry', 'never', 'stage-to-screen', 'translation', 'problem', 'path', 'chosen', 'as', 'intriguing', 'irksome', 'better', 'one', 'might', 'expect']",N/A

I knew it was going to be a very emotional experience for me so I chose to wait for it to come out on dvd to watch in the privacy and comfort of my home.  I knew it would affect me in a lot of ways that I would want to experience in private.  The performances in this movie were mesmerizing. The screenplay was a beautiful thread that wove together the poetry that is For Colored Girls.  The movie is not unfortunately, just For Colored Girls.  My understanding is the original book and play represented a diaspora of women, all colors all walks of life.  That is the true meaning of this movie.  It could just as easily be done with an all white cast, an all hispanic cast, an all asian cast, and have the same impact, because the experience of colored girls, unfortunately, is a universal experience.
