I LOVE Cheryl Burke and her nature...she is just pleasant to work out with. There is a couple that works out behind her that annoy me to no end. It is as if they are trying to ""out sexy"" each other and they end up looking really ridiculous. I think I would have given the series a 5 had they not been in the video...who wants to be annoyed for 30 minutes every morning!Cheryl Burke is the draw...the ladies on the podiums in the far back are fine...that couple in the middle? YUK.The workouts are fun...**Two weeks into using the dvd set**I still enjoy the workout and have got a feel of the different steps in each work out. I alternate the dvd's each day. It is a good work out and I enjoy it a lot. I would prefer the couple in the middle not be there at all, they still annoy me but I just try to focus on Cheryl and the other two ladies for instruction.",4,Fun work out!,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,933,"['grew', 'up', 'disco', 'era', 'music', 'fun', 'moves', 'are', 'familiar', 'LOVE', 'Cheryl', 'Burke', 'nature', 'just', 'pleasant', 'work', 'out', 'couple', 'out', 'end', 'are', 'trying', 'out', 'sexy', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'series', '5', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'video', 'who', 'be', 'annoyed', '30', 'minutes', 'morning', 'Cheryl', 'Burke', 'draw', 'ladies', 'podiums', 'far', 'back', 'are', 'fine', 'couple', 'middle', 'YUK.The', 'workouts', 'are', 'fun', '**Two', 'weeks', 'using', 'dvd', 'set**I', 'still', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'have', 'got', 'feel', 'different', 'steps', 'work', 'out', 'alternate', 'dvd', 'day', 'good', 'work', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'would', 'prefer', 'couple', 'middle', 'not', 'be', 'there', 'still', 'annoy', 'just', 'try', 'focus', 'Cheryl', 'other', 'two', 'ladies', 'instruction']",Cheryl Burke Presents Disco Abs

I actually enjoyed doing the routines and I sweated a lot so I knew I was working my body (besides being out of breath at times).  The music is fun and upbeat and encourages you to move.The first DVD has a 30 minute cardio routine and a 5 minute ab routine.  DVD number 2 has a 30 minute cardio routine and a 12 minute ab routine.  DVD 3 has a 20 minute buns and thighs routine.For me, DVD 3 was the hardest.  My legs really burned.  Maybe it was because I did it after the 12 minute ab routine.  I don't know.  Next time I'll do that routine first.I've only done each routine once, but I plan to do them again.  My body ached the next day because I had used muscles other exercise routines didn't.Cheryl does a good job with the cuing and explaining.  I think I did okay with the steps.  I have room to improve and that will come with doing the routines again.Cheryl has four people behind her also doing the routines.  The guy and gal directly behind her are annoying and I raised my eyebrows at some of their joint interaction and wanted to say, ""Get a room!""  I wonder what Cheryl thought when she saw the playback.  I also wonder why they didn't reshoot it and tell those two to cool it.  It would be better without them, but that's minor.I totally recommend this set and I look forward to getting Disco Abs!",5,HAVE FUN SWEATING,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,1445,"['am', 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'exercise', 'want', 'lose', 'weight', 'necessary', 'evil', 'DVD', 'set', 'fantastic', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'routines', 'sweated', 'lot', 'knew', 'was', 'working', 'body', 'being', 'breath', 'times', 'music', 'fun', 'upbeat', 'move.The', 'first', 'DVD', '30', 'minute', 'cardio', 'routine', '5', 'minute', 'ab', 'routine', 'DVD', 'number', '2', '30', 'minute', 'cardio', 'routine', '12', 'minute', 'ab', 'routine', 'DVD', '3', '20', 'minute', 'buns', 'thighs', 'routine.For', 'DVD', '3', 'was', 'hardest', 'legs', 'really', 'burned', 'Maybe', 'was', 'did', '12', 'minute', 'ab', 'routine', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Next', 'time', ""'ll"", 'do', 'routine', 'first.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'routine', 'once', 'plan', 'do', 'again', 'body', 'ached', 'next', 'day', 'had', 'used', 'muscles', 'other', 'exercise', 'routines', ""didn't.Cheryl"", 'good', 'job', 'cuing', 'explaining', 'think', 'did', 'okay', 'steps', 'have', 'room', 'improve', 'will', 'come', 'doing', 'routines', 'again.Cheryl', 'four', 'people', 'also', 'doing', 'routines', 'guy', 'gal', 'directly', 'are', 'annoying', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'joint', 'interaction', 'wanted', 'say', 'Get', 'room', 'wonder', 'what', 'Cheryl', 'thought', 'when', 'saw', 'playback', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'reshoot', 'tell', 'two', 'cool', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'minor.I', 'totally', 'recommend', 'set', 'look', 'forward', 'getting', 'Disco', 'Abs']",Cheryl Burke Presents Disco Abs

Some suck,most are ok, and there are one or two that are great. This one is phenomenal, and my absolute favorite.If you have no dance background and cannot pick up simple choreography as it is being danced, then don't buy this. You will feel confused, and probably get frustrated. Otherwise.....I LOVED the little timer at the bottom counting down the minutes. I LOVED the music! No more quasi-elevator music dance DVD's! I LOVED the super high energy level....everyone seemed to be bursting with energy,but not in an annoying way. I LOVED the moves...they were funky and fun. I LOVED the workout. It manages to pack a lot into thirty minutes.I LOVED that the music was loud enough so that I could hear it. I LOVED LOVED LOVED this DVD!If you like dance exercise DVD's then BUY THIS!I also wanted to say that all the reviews saying the couple behind Cheryl were annoying made me almost not buy it. When I did buy it anyway I braced myself for the worst, but couldn't see at all what they were talking about. They just looked like they were having a great time. This is DANCING and you are supposed to put your personality into it. I was glad to see them get into it and for me it added to the fun of the DVD.",5,My absolute favorite!,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,1297,"['have', 'been', 'dance', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'kick', 'lately', 'have', 'bought', 'about', '20', 'different', 'ones', 'suck', 'most', 'are', 'ok', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'great', 'one', 'phenomenal', 'absolute', 'favorite.If', 'have', 'dance', 'background', 'can', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'simple', 'choreography', 'being', 'danced', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'will', 'feel', 'confused', 'probably', 'get', 'frustrated', 'Otherwise', 'LOVED', 'little', 'timer', 'bottom', 'counting', 'down', 'minutes', 'LOVED', 'music', 'more', 'quasi-elevator', 'music', 'dance', 'DVD', 'LOVED', 'super', 'high', 'energy', 'level', '.everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'bursting', 'energy', 'not', 'annoying', 'way', 'LOVED', 'moves', 'were', 'funky', 'fun', 'LOVED', 'workout', 'pack', 'lot', 'thirty', 'minutes.I', 'LOVED', 'music', 'was', 'loud', 'enough', 'could', 'hear', 'LOVED', 'LOVED', 'LOVED', 'DVD', 'like', 'dance', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'then', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'also', 'wanted', 'say', 'reviews', 'saying', 'couple', 'Cheryl', 'were', 'annoying', 'made', 'almost', 'not', 'buy', 'When', 'did', 'buy', 'anyway', 'braced', 'worst', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'were', 'talking', 'about', 'just', 'looked', 'were', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'DANCING', 'are', 'supposed', 'put', 'personality', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'get', 'added', 'fun', 'DVD']",Cheryl Burke Presents Disco Abs
1300192,A1W817C9KE3ZPP,B002ZFEQNU,"Nicole Pellegrini ""sockii""","[2, 11]","I tried out the ""Disco Abs"" routine by Cheryl Burke on Exercise TV, which I assume is part of this DVD package. I was disappointed in the program, although it looked to be fun at the start, at least for the music (which I DID enjoy). However, from a workout point-of-view this program didn't do it for me. I like aerobics routines where the moves are simple to learn and follow, and don't require advanced ability and comfort with fancy dance choreography. Unfortunately, as a result this program turned out to be pretty much everything I DISLIKE as a result. I was quickly lost by the dance moves even after multiple viewings and attempts to pick them up. As a result I spent more time trying to catch up with the moves than burning calories. Maybe the full DVD package has more of a warm-up or basic guide to the moves?I feel like this might be a good workout for those already familiar with disco dancing and enjoy it, but for the rest of us?

1300193,A1SK49319MXQNR,B002ZFEQNU,"RockyMtnGal ""RockyMtnGal""","[6, 6]","I am a Zumba Instructor and Personal Trainer and I LOVE this workout.  I'm 48, so the music is from my era and I loved disco dancing back in the day. I believe that this is a good workout, but not extremely difficult.  I've read the negative reviews and here's my take on them. This ""ab"" workout is a ""standing"" ab workout. Ladies, please do not think that you must be lying on the floor to get an ab workout. You'll never have great abs anyway unless you are eating a clean diet. Doing long ab workouts on the floor are no more beneficial and you cannot spot reduce either and most people end up hurting their necks and backs with floor ab work. I always incorporate standing ab work in my classes.  As far as her cueing, it could be better. I believe every workout DVD should have a ""technique"" section to show people proper form on squats and lunges.  If you don't know proper form, please research it. There are many good videos on the internet with certified trainers showing you the correct form. Most of the steps are not difficult, example: 4 steps forward, tap, 4 steps back, tap, repeat to the side, etc. I think what most people find challenging is adding the hand movements.  If the hands throw you off, do the footwork first, then add the hands later.  Most of my clientele is around my age+ and I have done many of these moves with them and they did great and were able to follow along. It's not high impact, but it's challenging and it's not hard on the knees. As far as the songs, there are original songs, but on some of the workouts there are also instrumental disco tunes in between the original songs.  What people have to understand is the producers of the DVD must pay dearly for the rights to use these songs. If they use too many, they have to raise the price of the DVD. So, they are just trying to keep costs down. There are slower songs that you can start with (e.g. The Beginner Hustle) and work your way to the faster ones. One reviewer said they were disappointed by boring squats and lunges. Well, unfortunately, those are the BEST compound exercises for your legs. The way they are done in this workout makes them more fun. You can't please everyone all the time, so some will think this is too easy and some too difficult. I have been teaching fitness for many years to people with 2 left feet (their words, not mine), bad backs and bad knees, and they are able to do this type of workout. But you have to stick with it and you may not get it the first few times around, but persevere!!",5,Great workout and FUN!!!,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,2519,"['am', 'Zumba', 'Instructor', 'Personal', 'Trainer', 'LOVE', 'workout', ""'m"", '48', 'music', 'era', 'loved', 'disco', 'dancing', 'back', 'day', 'believe', 'good', 'workout', 'not', 'extremely', 'difficult', ""'ve"", 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'take', 'ab', 'workout', 'standing', 'ab', 'workout', 'Ladies', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'lying', 'floor', 'get', 'ab', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'never', 'have', 'great', 'abs', 'anyway', 'are', 'eating', 'clean', 'diet', 'Doing', 'long', 'ab', 'workouts', 'floor', 'are', 'more', 'beneficial', 'can', 'not', 'spot', 'reduce', 'most', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'hurting', 'necks', 'backs', 'floor', 'ab', 'work', 'always', 'incorporate', 'standing', 'ab', 'work', 'classes', 'As', 'far', 'cueing', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'believe', 'workout', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'technique', 'section', 'show', 'people', 'proper', 'form', 'squats', 'lunges', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'proper', 'form', 'please', 'research', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'videos', 'internet', 'certified', 'trainers', 'showing', 'correct', 'form', 'Most', 'steps', 'are', 'not', 'difficult', 'example', '4', 'steps', 'forward', 'tap', '4', 'steps', 'back', 'tap', 'repeat', 'side', 'etc', 'think', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'find', 'challenging', 'adding', 'hand', 'movements', 'hands', 'throw', 'off', 'do', 'footwork', 'first', 'then', 'add', 'hands', 'later', 'Most', 'clientele', 'age+', 'have', 'done', 'many', 'moves', 'did', 'great', 'were', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'not', 'high', 'impact', 'challenging', 'not', 'hard', 'knees', 'As', 'far', 'songs', 'are', 'original', 'songs', 'workouts', 'are', 'also', 'instrumental', 'disco', 'tunes', 'original', 'songs', 'What', 'people', 'have', 'understand', 'producers', 'DVD', 'must', 'pay', 'dearly', 'rights', 'use', 'songs', 'use', 'too', 'many', 'have', 'raise', 'price', 'DVD', 'So', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'keep', 'costs', 'down', 'are', 'slower', 'songs', 'can', 'start', 'e.g', 'Beginner', 'Hustle', 'work', 'way', 'faster', 'ones', 'One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'were', 'disappointed', 'boring', 'squats', 'lunges', 'Well', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'BEST', 'compound', 'legs', 'way', 'are', 'done', 'workout', 'more', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'please', 'everyone', 'time', 'so', 'will', 'think', 'too', 'easy', 'too', 'difficult', 'have', 'been', 'teaching', 'fitness', 'many', 'years', 'people', '2', 'left', 'feet', 'words', 'not', 'mine', 'bad', 'backs', 'bad', 'knees', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'type', 'workout', 'have', 'stick', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'around', 'persevere']",Cheryl Burke Presents Disco Abs

The ""Disco Abs"" set of videos are fun and I don't get bored because I mix and match them. I am an experienced exerciser and this is one of my favorite videos - I even ordered another copy of this for my sister as a gift. Cheryl starts out every part slowly so you can catch the steps which are not complicated. I have a video where the steps are so fast and complicated that I can't do them so I know what I am talking about when I say ""not complicated"". Remember that if some moves on any video are not for you, you can always march or run in place. The idea is to keep moving, and these videos will keep you moving!
