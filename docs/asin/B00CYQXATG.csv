1652115,A32JN2H1NIVILH,B00CYQXATG,,"[0, 0]","Criminal Minds is one of my favorite shows currently on TV but I had a hard time adjusting to the new episodes being a fan of both Elle Greenaway and Jason Giddeon. The early episodes will always be the best but the new ones aren't bad. I've started to like David Rossi better as a character with age and Alex Blake isn't as bad as others say. The show has changed a bit over the years but it's still going strong surprisingly after 9 years. Most of the new characters aren't bad, it just takes time getting used to. The direction has changed a bit as well, the episodes go for a more violent direction but they still have a psychological overtone which keeps it from being a straight-up slasher film. I've noticed over time that all the characters are unique from each other and it's what makes the show along with the quality writing. As a crime drama, Criminal Minds stands out from the others as far as being more believable. Season 9 has it's low points but it has enough good episodes to make it worth while, particularly the cliffhanger ending in the latest episode &#34;Angel&#34; (looking forward to the season finale this Wednesday).",4,Criminal Minds Still Going Strong.,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1143,"['Criminal', 'Minds', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'currently', 'TV', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'adjusting', 'new', 'episodes', 'being', 'fan', 'Elle', 'Greenaway', 'Jason', 'Giddeon', 'early', 'episodes', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'best', 'new', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', ""'ve"", 'started', 'like', 'David', 'Rossi', 'better', 'character', 'age', 'Alex', 'Blake', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'others', 'say', 'show', 'changed', 'bit', 'years', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'surprisingly', '9', 'years', 'Most', 'new', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'time', 'getting', 'used', 'direction', 'changed', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'go', 'more', 'violent', 'direction', 'still', 'have', 'psychological', 'overtone', 'being', 'straight-up', 'slasher', 'film', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'unique', 'other', 'what', 'show', 'quality', 'writing', 'crime', 'drama', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'out', 'others', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'more', 'believable', 'Season', '9', 'low', 'points', 'enough', 'good', 'episodes', 'make', 'worth', 'particularly', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'latest', 'episode', '34', 'Angel', '34', 'looking', 'forward', 'season', 'finale', 'Wednesday']",Criminal Minds: Season 9

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","&#34;Criminal Minds&#34; returns for its ninth season on CBS television in 2013-2014 with its marvelous cast intact and a terrific lineup of chilling new cases, to be solved by the special agents of the FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit (BAU). Macabre plots, an ensemble cast with well-developed characters, and dynamic teamwork continue to pull in viewers.At the end of last season, Assistant Director Erin Strauss was murdered by an unexpected killer with inside knowledge of the BAU, who stalked the entire team with considerable skill.  As Season Nine opens, and that killer presumed dead, speculation runs through the team that Hotchner might be given Strauss's job, pulling him out of day to day casework.  When a new BAU director is chosen, it turns out to be someone from JJ's recent and still secret past with another agency.  That past will come back to haunt JJ and the team in a critical episode, which turns out to be the 200th of the series.  Paget Brewster will make a return appearance as Emily Prentiss to be reunited with her old teammates for the case.Another exciting episode will have Hotchner in the hospital, when old wounds leave him in critical condition.  While his life hangs in the balance, he will be reunited with his wife, and her murderer.  The case's conclusion may be a turning point in Hotchner's life.  Another episode will have the agents chasing a killer who seems to be reliving the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  Still other story lines will have the agents jetting around the country to help local enforcement with difficult cases.  Although the weekly cases follow a familiar pattern, story twists indicate the show is not running out of originality.  &#34;Criminal Minds: The Ninth Season&#34; is highly recommended to its fans.",4,Another season with more reasons to watch...,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,1770,"['34', 'Criminal', 'Minds', '34', 'returns', 'ninth', 'season', 'CBS', 'television', '2013-2014', 'marvelous', 'cast', 'intact', 'terrific', 'lineup', 'chilling', 'new', 'cases', 'be', 'solved', 'special', 'agents', 'FBI', 'Behavior', 'Analysis', 'Unit', 'BAU', 'Macabre', 'plots', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'dynamic', 'teamwork', 'continue', 'pull', 'viewers.At', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Erin', 'Strauss', 'was', 'murdered', 'unexpected', 'killer', 'inside', 'knowledge', 'BAU', 'who', 'stalked', 'entire', 'team', 'considerable', 'skill', 'Season', 'Nine', 'killer', 'presumed', 'dead', 'speculation', 'runs', 'team', 'Hotchner', 'might', 'be', 'given', 'Strauss', 'job', 'pulling', 'day', 'day', 'casework', 'When', 'new', 'BAU', 'director', 'chosen', 'out', 'be', 'someone', 'JJ', 'recent', 'still', 'secret', 'past', 'agency', 'past', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'JJ', 'team', 'critical', 'episode', 'out', 'be', '200th', 'series', 'Paget', 'Brewster', 'will', 'make', 'return', 'appearance', 'Emily', 'Prentiss', 'be', 'reunited', 'old', 'teammates', 'case.Another', 'exciting', 'episode', 'will', 'have', 'Hotchner', 'hospital', 'when', 'old', 'wounds', 'leave', 'critical', 'condition', 'life', 'hangs', 'balance', 'will', 'be', 'reunited', 'wife', 'murderer', 'case', 'conclusion', 'may', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'Hotchner', 'life', 'episode', 'will', 'have', 'agents', 'chasing', 'killer', 'who', 'be', 'reliving', 'assassination', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Still', 'other', 'story', 'lines', 'will', 'have', 'agents', 'jetting', 'country', 'help', 'local', 'enforcement', 'difficult', 'cases', 'weekly', 'cases', 'follow', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'story', 'twists', 'indicate', 'show', 'not', 'running', 'originality', '34', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'Ninth', 'Season', '34', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans']",Criminal Minds: Season 9

Their writers are genuinely twisted.The real issue I have with Criminal Minds as well as ALL Amazon streaming videos is that you can't stream them to an Android tablet except for a Kindle unless you graduated with a degree in computer science.
