1028517,A32RF0KJA4ZE6E,B000JLTRLS,Alanna Evans,"[15, 15]","This is actually three Pony episodes on one DVD.  The first, Come Back Lily Lightly is about a Unicorn from Unicornia who's horn lights up when she giggles.  This causes her much embarrassment and she runs away for fear of being different.  Sounds familiar?  This is the old Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer story of acceptance, given a pony glossing.  Cute, but unoriginal.The second story is Two for the Sky about two ponies who want nothing more than to fly.  This teaches the moral that its often best just being yourself and being content with who you are and what you have.  Dreams are often best left to dreams.The third story is Pinkie Pie's Positively Pink.  Pinkie has a birthday coming up and her friends want to surprise her by painting the town...Pink!  Its a story of friendship and not much else.The animation is nice, very vibrant and colorful, the stories are standard fare, nothing great.  Some of the songs stick out and are memorable singalongs.  Unfortunately this DVD does NOT come with extra episodes like the previous two did.  So all you get is the three Pony shorts lasting about 45 minutes total.I thought it was OK kind of cute and decent lessons about being a friend.  My daughter loved it and watched it four times in a row the first time she had it.  I can safely say that its a clean DVD with little conflict and absolutely nothing ""scary"" or objectionable and is suitable for any age.",4,Pony Fun,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,1414,"['actually', 'three', 'Pony', 'episodes', 'one', 'DVD', 'first', 'Come', 'Back', 'Lily', 'Lightly', 'Unicorn', 'Unicornia', 'who', 'horn', 'lights', 'up', 'when', 'much', 'embarrassment', 'away', 'fear', 'being', 'different', 'familiar', 'old', 'Rudolph', 'Red', 'Nose', 'Reindeer', 'story', 'acceptance', 'given', 'pony', 'glossing', 'Cute', 'unoriginal.The', 'second', 'story', 'Two', 'Sky', 'two', 'ponies', 'who', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'fly', 'moral', 'often', 'best', 'just', 'being', 'being', 'content', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'have', 'Dreams', 'are', 'often', 'best', 'left', 'dreams.The', 'third', 'story', 'Pinkie', 'Pie', 'Positively', 'Pink', 'Pinkie', 'birthday', 'coming', 'up', 'friends', 'want', 'surprise', 'painting', 'town', 'Pink', 'story', 'friendship', 'not', 'much', 'else.The', 'animation', 'nice', 'very', 'vibrant', 'colorful', 'stories', 'are', 'standard', 'fare', 'nothing', 'great', 'songs', 'stick', 'out', 'are', 'memorable', 'singalongs', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'come', 'extra', 'episodes', 'previous', 'two', 'did', 'So', 'get', 'three', 'Pony', 'shorts', 'lasting', '45', 'minutes', 'total.I', 'thought', 'was', 'OK', 'kind', 'cute', 'decent', 'lessons', 'being', 'friend', 'daughter', 'loved', 'watched', 'four', 'times', 'row', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'clean', 'DVD', 'little', 'conflict', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'scary', 'objectionable', 'suitable', 'age']",My Little Pony - A Very Pony Place

The problem with at least our copy is that when you hit ""play all"" it does not play them all in the right sequence so the closing credits appear after the first story which is supposed to be the last story.  It will throw kids off at first, and maybe parents too, but once we discovered what was happening we have been fine with it.",5,good video,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,454,"['two', 'youngest', 'girls', '3', '6', 'love', 'video', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch', 'problem', 'least', 'copy', 'when', 'hit', 'play', 'not', 'play', 'right', 'sequence', 'closing', 'credits', 'appear', 'first', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'last', 'story', 'will', 'throw', 'kids', 'off', 'first', 'maybe', 'parents', 'too', 'once', 'discovered', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'have', 'been', 'fine']",My Little Pony - A Very Pony Place

She has the ""Lily Lightly"" pony so this DVD, which features Lily, is a great addition to her collection.  The length is perfect, about 45 minutes.  Although I haven't timed it, I believe the second and third stories are shorter than the first, but my daughter doesn't mind.  It features some great new, very catchy songs, which I find myself singing as well...!  Yes, I'm a dad.
