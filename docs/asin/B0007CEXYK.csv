I have watched lots of documentaries on drug use and lots of touching movies that stir your soul. Clearly these writers tried to do both, but it just did not come across.  The acting, the entire time, felt like I was watching actors practicing their parts. Of course, they are just actors, but the viewer (hopefully) can lose themselves in the scenes..not with Acts of Worship.What you do get: lots of drug use and users with clear skin, lots and LOTS AND LOTS of dropping the F bomb (their effort at gritty) and many scenes where you can almost hear the violin in the background..hoping to make cheesy scenes more sincere.A woman is a recovering drug addict and finds a user (current addict) outside her apartment door. Of course we assume the user is going to give up drugs but it will be a hard battle. Okay..forget the hard battle. It's just so pretty!I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say that while there are scenes that could have been sad or moving or tense..they were just predictable and weakly acted.I would not recommend this movie at all.",1,"Simple acting, tries to be gritty but ends up falling flat.",1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,1109,"['movie', 'opinion', 'over-hyped', 'have', 'watched', 'lots', 'documentaries', 'drug', 'use', 'lots', 'touching', 'movies', 'stir', 'soul', 'Clearly', 'writers', 'tried', 'do', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'acting', 'entire', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'actors', 'practicing', 'parts', 'course', 'are', 'just', 'actors', 'viewer', 'hopefully', 'can', 'lose', 'scenes..not', 'Acts', 'Worship.What', 'do', 'get', 'lots', 'drug', 'use', 'users', 'clear', 'skin', 'lots', 'LOTS', 'AND', 'LOTS', 'dropping', 'F', 'bomb', 'effort', 'gritty', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'violin', 'background..hoping', 'make', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'more', 'sincere.A', 'woman', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict', 'user', 'current', 'addict', 'apartment', 'door', 'course', 'assume', 'user', 'going', 'give', 'up', 'drugs', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'battle', 'Okay..forget', 'hard', 'battle', 'just', 'so', 'pretty', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'are', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sad', 'moving', 'tense..they', 'were', 'just', 'predictable', 'weakly', 'acted.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie']",Acts of Worship

879739,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B0007CEXYK,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[33, 33]","The storyline is the type of thing you find on a Lifetime Network Special or a straight-to-television movie trying to warn about the dangers of drug addiction, but this movie goes so far beyond that. It's not like it adds zany warped realities like Requiem for a Dream or it has some sort of narration keeping the audience completely informed that ""this is what you should fear to be"", it does everything so much simpler than that: It sits back and lets the actors eat the audience's collective heart out.The drama in this film is SO UTTERLY CONVINCING. The performances get first prize for portrayals that, even when you want to try and find something wrong with it (I'm guessing this film might be considered too sentimental by some), keep the drama serious and prominent, not allowing the audience to let go of their suspension of disbelief. If it wasn't for the production quality, it would seem like this was a documentary and these were real people. And it's not just Ana and Michael, the two main characters, it's everyone, from the boyfriends to the crack addicts that have two seconds of screen time to everyone.Secondly, the cinematography and editing are very well tuned to excellence. This movie definitely has the feel of an independent film, but more than that it doesn't have that ""Look at me, I'm independent!"" feel. Skewed angles and purposeful jump cuts exist stylistically in the film, but they come at the right times and are completely necessary, versus what tends to happen in a lot of independent cinema where the camera becomes relatively self-conscious and goes places it needn't. For example, the hand-held quality of this film is almost invisible, while some independent films tend to show off their independence via hand-held in a wannabe cinema-verite sort of conceit.It's disappointing that I haven't heard anything about this film before. I literally picked it up because it was the first movie on the first row of the first aisle to rent because I wanted to surprise myself, and whadyaknow but it happened to be a real gem! I hope it builds a bigger audience because it deserves to be recognized.--PolarisDiB",5,So utterly convincing...,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,2140,"['storyline', 'type', 'thing', 'find', 'Lifetime', 'Network', 'Special', 'straight-to-television', 'movie', 'trying', 'warn', 'dangers', 'drug', 'addiction', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'zany', 'warped', 'realities', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'sort', 'narration', 'keeping', 'audience', 'completely', 'informed', 'what', 'should', 'fear', 'be', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'simpler', 'back', 'actors', 'eat', 'audience', 'collective', 'heart', 'out.The', 'drama', 'film', 'SO', 'UTTERLY', 'CONVINCING', 'performances', 'get', 'first', 'prize', 'portrayals', 'even', 'when', 'want', 'try', 'find', 'something', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'too', 'sentimental', 'keep', 'drama', 'serious', 'prominent', 'not', 'allowing', 'audience', 'let', 'go', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'was', ""n't"", 'production', 'quality', 'would', 'seem', 'was', 'documentary', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'Ana', 'Michael', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'everyone', 'boyfriends', 'crack', 'have', 'two', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time', 'everyone.Secondly', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'tuned', 'excellence', 'movie', 'definitely', 'feel', 'independent', 'film', 'more', ""n't"", 'have', 'Look', ""'m"", 'independent', 'feel', 'Skewed', 'angles', 'purposeful', 'jump', 'cuts', 'exist', 'stylistically', 'film', 'come', 'right', 'times', 'are', 'completely', 'necessary', 'versus', 'what', 'happen', 'lot', 'independent', 'cinema', 'where', 'camera', 'relatively', 'self-conscious', 'places', 'need', ""n't"", 'example', 'hand-held', 'quality', 'film', 'almost', 'invisible', 'independent', 'films', 'tend', 'show', 'off', 'independence', 'hand-held', 'wannabe', 'cinema-verite', 'sort', 'conceit.It', 'disappointing', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anything', 'film', 'literally', 'picked', 'up', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'first', 'row', 'first', 'aisle', 'rent', 'wanted', 'surprise', 'whadyaknow', 'happened', 'be', 'real', 'gem', 'hope', 'bigger', 'audience', 'be', 'recognized.', 'PolarisDiB']",Acts of Worship

879744,A3REMJM3Y3IPWM,B0007CEXYK,Torino,"[1, 2]","DVD picture and sound excellent, standard aspect ratio.  Story concerns a young woman struggling to overcome her addiction with the help of a recovering addict.  Based partly on the writer/director's experience with addiction in her youth.  The movie was recommended by some viewers of Requiem for a Dream.  It is not as melodramatic as RFAD, nor as gritty as &#34;Panic in Needle Park&#34; but still very interesting.  I'd almost call it a chick flick drug movie because the two lead characters are female, and the focus is on female addicts.  There are some graphic scenes of drug use and considering the subject matter, a lot of profanity.  It does not glorify drugs at all, but does a great job of showing the shallow desperation addicts live day to day.  The stealing, lying, loss of self esteem, and cold exploitation of the weak is depressing to watch, but at the same time very believable.  Some of the actors look too clean cut to pass for junkies, but Ana Reeder does a pretty good job at it and in fact practically carries the film.
