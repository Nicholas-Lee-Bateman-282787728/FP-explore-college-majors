453108,A3GD923K1K602I,6305177317,"Dix88 ""Love Ocean""","[3, 3]","My husband and I often rent or buy films about WWII. His father was a pilot who suffered severe injuries in the war. He married a girl from South Hampton. She worked in a factory throughout the war. Her father refused to go into bomb shelters. He'd sit on the lawn, drinking a pint, cursing the Germans. We had seen Steven MackIntosh in the ""Prime Suspect,"" episode 5, wherein he played a hideously vicious gang leader. He was as fascinating as Bill the Butcher in that role. ""Land Girls"" started out sort of Larky, with 3 girls off to work on a beautifully real old fashioned farm. The scenery is amazing. The Plough horses are lovely. You get a glimpse of Joe's kindness as he brushes down one of the horses, with Ag watching. Altho' he is hard put to turn down the advances of these young women, Joe eventually falls in love with one.  Ralph Bellamy has a touching role (he played the imaginary room-mate in ""Beautiful Mind"") Every member of this cast was brilliant. Nothing turns out as would be expected. It's a point of pride with me that I rarely ever cry but my husband and I had tears in our eyes during many scenes (especially the end) of this elegantly told story.  Do buy it! I shall watch it over & over again. Blessings on everyone involved in the making of this lovely film.",5,"Touching, Real Story",1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,1289,"['husband', 'often', 'rent', 'buy', 'films', 'WWII', 'father', 'was', 'pilot', 'who', 'suffered', 'severe', 'injuries', 'war', 'married', 'girl', 'South', 'Hampton', 'worked', 'factory', 'war', 'father', 'refused', 'go', 'bomb', 'shelters', ""'d"", 'sit', 'lawn', 'drinking', 'pint', 'cursing', 'Germans', 'had', 'seen', 'Steven', 'MackIntosh', 'Prime', 'Suspect', '5', 'wherein', 'played', 'hideously', 'vicious', 'gang', 'leader', 'was', 'as', 'fascinating', 'Bill', 'Butcher', 'role', 'Land', 'Girls', 'started', 'out', 'sort', 'Larky', '3', 'girls', 'work', 'beautifully', 'real', 'old', 'fashioned', 'farm', 'scenery', 'amazing', 'Plough', 'horses', 'are', 'lovely', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Joe', 'kindness', 'down', 'one', 'horses', 'Ag', 'watching', 'Altho', 'hard', 'put', 'turn', 'down', 'advances', 'young', 'women', 'Joe', 'eventually', 'love', 'one', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'touching', 'role', 'played', 'imaginary', 'room-mate', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'member', 'cast', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Nothing', 'out', 'as', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'point', 'pride', 'rarely', 'ever', 'cry', 'husband', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'many', 'scenes', 'especially', 'end', 'elegantly', 'told', 'story', 'Do', 'buy', 'shall', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'Blessings', 'everyone', 'involved', 'making', 'lovely', 'film']",The Land Girls VHS
453109,APYCNRS112N2B,6305177317,Eat The Rich Books,"[11, 25]","I like World War II dramas particularly the ones that delve into the more obscure aspects.  Many interesting character dramas have evolved, notably, Schindler's List, Memphis Belle, The Americanization of Emily, Tuskeegee  Airmen,  and Hiroshima. Even the bio pics: Patton, Truman, Eisenhower all  provided interesting perspective for me, where I had none before.The  idea that England had a Woman's Land Army in WWII, whereby women went to  take over farm chores as the men have gone off to war, sounds interesting.  Women of all shapes and sizes, and backgrounds banding together for the  common good, yep, it definitely has possibilities.Now add Catherine  McCormack in the lead, a woman who has the opportunity over the next few  years to surpass Michelle Pfeiffer, as the beautiful woman who CAN act,  throw in stunning  period locations and costumes, and Land Girls should not  fail.But fail it does.The story of these three women (McCormack,  Rachel Weisz, Anna Friel) is limp and un-centered, where, by comparison,  The Tuskeegee Airmen is driving and informative.Pass on this mess, and  if you want to see more of Catherine McCormack (aside from Braveheart)  choose Dangerous Beauty instead.",1,"Could have, would have, should have..",950400000,"02 13, 2000",2000,1200,"['like', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'dramas', 'particularly', 'ones', 'delve', 'more', 'obscure', 'aspects', 'Many', 'interesting', 'character', 'dramas', 'have', 'evolved', 'notably', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Memphis', 'Belle', 'Americanization', 'Emily', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'Hiroshima', 'Even', 'bio', 'pics', 'Patton', 'Truman', 'Eisenhower', 'provided', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'where', 'had', 'none', 'before.The', 'idea', 'England', 'had', 'Woman', 'Land', 'Army', 'WWII', 'whereby', 'women', 'went', 'take', 'over', 'farm', 'chores', 'men', 'have', 'gone', 'off', 'war', 'interesting', 'Women', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'banding', 'together', 'common', 'good', 'yep', 'definitely', 'possibilities.Now', 'add', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'lead', 'woman', 'who', 'opportunity', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'surpass', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'CAN', 'act', 'throw', 'stunning', 'period', 'locations', 'costumes', 'Land', 'Girls', 'should', 'not', 'fail.But', 'fail', 'does.The', 'story', 'three', 'women', 'McCormack', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'limp', 'un-centered', 'where', 'comparison', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'driving', 'informative.Pass', 'mess', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'aside', 'Braveheart', 'choose', 'Dangerous', 'Beauty', 'instead']",The Land Girls VHS

While flipping through the movie channels, I came across Land Girls. I just happenend on the roll in the hay scene between Anna Friel and Steven Mackintosh. Well naturally, I stopped my surfing to take in this wonderful and comedic moment of the film. Having been hooked, I watched the remainder and like other reviewers was surprised to learn of the ""Land Girls"".  Yet another aspect of the Second World War that I had yet to learn.The three woman Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna Friel are a delight to watch. It would be difficult to imagine three more appealing women in this setting. Mackintosh is equally appealing as a young man stuck on the farm and for some reason passed over by the recruiting boards. And yet, what a lucky fellow to pass his days with such lovely and interesting women.So, it is true that the Merchant and Ivory crowd will probably find this moving more appealing than the average ""meat and potatoes"" film viewer, but this movie has just enough spice, energy and beauty to hold even the non-chic flick viewer's attention.It certainly held mine through successive viewings. I guess I hoped that she would finally step off the train at the end...I guess I really wanted that ending.

They not only filled a vacancy left by the farmer's sons, but broke new ground in order to increase the production needed to feed the troops as well as those left behind in the country.
