48723,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,0783221312,calvinnme,"[1, 4]","This has to be one of the worst movies I ever saw. I should have known by it's release date - September - I was in for less than a treat. That's after all of the summer blockbusters have been released and before the academy award possibilities start cropping up in October/November. And remember, 1996 was the year that the word ""blockbuster"" was defined by unwatchable schlock such as Independence Day and Twister.Jack Keats (Damon Wayons) is an undercover cop posing as a car thief in order to get information from a real car thief, Archie Moses (Adam Sandler). The two have actually developed a kind of friendship during the time they are working together. After gaining his trust, Moses offers to introduce Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton (James Caan). Keats jumps at the chance to home in on bigger criminal game. Thus as Keats is meeting Colton for the first time, the police appear on the scene to make their arrests in the case. In the resulting chaos, Keats is shot in the head. Keats has a slow but sure recovery. On the bright side, he falls in love with the woman who helps him recover. On the negative side, he now has a metal plate in his head. Afterwards, when he is back on duty, Keats is assigned to escort Moses back to testify against his former employer Colton, a situation neither one is looking forward to. Keats is angry because thanks to Moses he has a metal plate in his head, and Moses is angry because Keats lied to him over the entire year that he thought they were friends and colleagues. This movie seems to be going for the buddy/road film angle, with the exception of the fact that Keats and Moses run into a series of attempts on their lives since Colton, the big drug kingpin, is out to kill them both. This forces them to work together to figure out why their every move seems to be known by Colton before they even make it. In the end, the identity of the informant that is helping Colton is not surprising, and Keats must face a little betrayal of his own.Both Wayans and Sandler can be very funny if given the right material, but neither has anything particularly funny to do or say here, since the material they are working with is totally lacking in the imagination and genuine humor that could have exploited the talents of the two leading men.

48726,A364W6U6YL219D,0783221312,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[1, 2]","Bulletproof (1996) Damon Wayans (Blankman) and Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore) team up for this ragged but watchable buddy action comedy from director Ernest Dickerson (Surviving the Game). Wayans is an undercover cop who has spent a year befriending two-bit criminal Sandler in order to get closer to Sandler's boss (James Caan). When Wayans moves in to make his bust, it all goes wrong and Sandler accidentally shoots Wayans before escaping. Months later, Sandler is ready to turn himself in, but demands that a recovered Wayans be the cop to do it. Reluctantly, Wayans agrees, and soon they're both clay pigeons for Caan's henchmen. It's a cross between a Lethal Weapon sequel and yet another Saturday Night Live cast movie, and as such isn't exactly seamless. The guys get in some funny lines, but the film goes overboard with the comedy and gets silly too often, especially with all the violence. Sandler wavers between actually acting and doing an extension of his Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore roles, but Wayans is pretty good. All in all, if you like these guys, this will probably serve as entertainment, especially on good ol' home video. Also with James Farentino (Dead and Buried).",3,Tough cop. Hostile Witness.

48748,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,0783221312,Some Gravity,"[9, 11]","In Hollywood, several comedy stars who make action flicks usually get laughed at- and they usually get laughed at pretty bad.  Sure, it would be interesting to see someone like Jim Carrey or Robin Williams do an action movie,but that will probably never happen, and once comedy star Bruce Willis proved that he could pull off an action movie(""Die Hard"")while Eddie Murphy has a talent for both action and comedy as well.  So, if you take a look at Adam Sandler and his movies, and if you thought that you would never see Adam Sandler do an action movie, then you are wrong-because Sandler's 1996 film with Daman Wayans, ""Bulletproof"" does have some comedy in it, but there is a lot of action in it as well.The movie starts off with Sandler portaying Archie Moses, a small time car thief and a drug dealer in Los Angeles.  His best friend is Rock Keats (Wayans)who is also a car thief. Moses and Keats have been friends for a year. Meanwhile, Moses is working on a drug operation with a drug lord named Frank Colton (James Caan)and talks to Colton (his boss)about bringing Keats in on their operation.  Colton is worried that Keats is a cop, but Moses assures Colton that Keats is not a cop, and then Keats is in on the operation.  The only problem is that Keats is a cop, his real name is Jack Carter, and he is working undercover with the LAPD to bust Moses and Colton at a sting operation the LAPD has set up.Then, the day finally comes.  When Moses finds out that Keats is a cop, he feels angry.  He feels betrayed.  And then he shoots Keats (accidently).  Moses and Colton then become fugitives, Keats ends up in a Los Angeles hospital, and six months later, he gets out. This is when Moses is arrested in Arizona, and because Colton wants Moses dead for a bringing a cop into his organization (as well as Keats)Moses is ready to turn Colton in so Colton will be arrested and Moses won't have to worry for his life.  But Moses will only bring Colton in on one condition: Keats must bring him in.  So Keats flys out to Arizona so he can bring Moses back to California to testify against Colton.  However, Colton is aware of everything that has happened, and as a result, Moses and Colton spend their time trying to get back to California while they are at each other's throats, and several funny events are happening.""Bulletproof"" is an enjoyable, underrated action/comedy flick.  It was directed by Ernest Dickerson, who has directed thrillers such as ""Juice"" and ""Surviving The Game"" and has even worked with Spike Lee as a cinematagrapher on some of his films.  Dickerson is a good director, and ""Bulletproof"" gives him the chance to show his directing talent.  Adam Sandler, Daman Wayans, and James Caan do a good job with their acting in this movie, while they keep the chemistry flowing between their characters.  ""Bulletproof"" is action, comedy, and chemistry all together at their best, and if you are a fan of Adam Sandler, Daman Wayans, James Caan, or movies with both action and comedy, then you should check out this movie.",5,"An enjoyable, underrated action/comedy flick",1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,3038,"['Hollywood', 'several', 'comedy', 'stars', 'who', 'make', 'action', 'flicks', 'usually', 'get', 'laughed', 'at-', 'usually', 'get', 'laughed', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Sure', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'someone', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'do', 'action', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'happen', 'once', 'comedy', 'star', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'proved', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'action', 'movie', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'talent', 'action', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'take', 'look', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'do', 'action', 'movie', 'then', 'are', 'wrong-because', 'Sandler', '1996', 'film', 'Daman', 'Wayans', 'Bulletproof', 'have', 'comedy', 'lot', 'action', 'well.The', 'movie', 'Sandler', 'portaying', 'Archie', 'Moses', 'small', 'time', 'car', 'thief', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'best', 'friend', 'Rock', 'Keats', 'Wayans', 'who', 'also', 'car', 'thief', 'Moses', 'Keats', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'year', 'Meanwhile', 'Moses', 'working', 'drug', 'operation', 'drug', 'lord', 'named', 'Frank', 'Colton', 'James', 'Caan', 'talks', 'Colton', 'boss', 'bringing', 'Keats', 'operation', 'Colton', 'worried', 'Keats', 'cop', 'Moses', 'Colton', 'Keats', 'not', 'cop', 'then', 'Keats', 'operation', 'only', 'problem', 'Keats', 'cop', 'real', 'name', 'Jack', 'Carter', 'working', 'undercover', 'LAPD', 'bust', 'Moses', 'Colton', 'sting', 'operation', 'LAPD', 'set', 'up.Then', 'day', 'finally', 'When', 'Moses', 'out', 'Keats', 'cop', 'angry', 'betrayed', 'then', 'Keats', 'accidently', 'Moses', 'Colton', 'then', 'become', 'fugitives', 'Keats', 'up', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'hospital', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'out', 'when', 'Moses', 'arrested', 'Arizona', 'Colton', 'Moses', 'dead', 'bringing', 'cop', 'organization', 'as', 'well', 'Keats', 'Moses', 'ready', 'turn', 'Colton', 'so', 'Colton', 'will', 'be', 'arrested', 'Moses', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'life', 'Moses', 'will', 'only', 'bring', 'Colton', 'one', 'condition', 'Keats', 'must', 'bring', 'Keats', 'flys', 'out', 'Arizona', 'can', 'bring', 'Moses', 'back', 'California', 'testify', 'Colton', 'However', 'Colton', 'aware', 'everything', 'happened', 'result', 'Moses', 'Colton', 'spend', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'California', 'are', 'other', 'throats', 'several', 'funny', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'Bulletproof', 'enjoyable', 'underrated', 'action/comedy', 'flick', 'was', 'directed', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'who', 'directed', 'thrillers', 'such', 'Juice', 'Surviving', 'Game', 'even', 'worked', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'cinematagrapher', 'films', 'Dickerson', 'good', 'director', 'Bulletproof', 'chance', 'show', 'directing', 'talent', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Daman', 'Wayans', 'James', 'Caan', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'movie', 'keep', 'chemistry', 'flowing', 'characters', 'Bulletproof', 'action', 'comedy', 'chemistry', 'together', 'best', 'are', 'fan', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Daman', 'Wayans', 'James', 'Caan', 'movies', 'action', 'comedy', 'then', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'movie']",N/A
