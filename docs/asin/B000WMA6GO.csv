1110309,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B000WMA6GO,Brad Baker,"[11, 12]","Considered lost, and certainly forgotten, John Ford's 1933 ""Pilgrimage"" has been digitally restored, and DVD-intact, it has returned; on a two-feature transfer with Ford's 1930 Army-gangster film, ""Born Reckless(starring Edmund Lowe)"". We have found an early John Ford classic, thanks to Berkeley film archivist David Shepard. ""Pilgrimage"" is the story of Hannah Jessop and her son, Jimmy, alone and together, on an Arkansas farm. Jimmy falls in love, and wants to marry. Hannah will have none of it. Hannah Jessop is a hard-hearted old woman, proud of her descent from pioneers. When her son falls in love and declares his independence, Hannah is confronted with the dilemma of losing her son. Hannah's solution is chilling: she enlists him in the army. As she puts pen to paper, she is signing what is clearly her son's death warrant, as World War I rages in Europe. To Mary, the girl he loves, she says: ""I'd rather see him dead than married to you"". In a short scene, on a French battlefield, Jimmy is killed, buried alive in a collapsing trench.  Hannah is notified of his death by the town major. Her grief is real, but her stoical nature will allow no verbal expression. John Ford instead conveys her deepest inner fealings in one of the most heartrending moments of visual poetry; her hands are seen reassembling the pieces of a ripped-up photograph of her smiling son. Romantic pessimism unveils the dark side of John Ford. 10 years later, Hannah is coaxed into joining a boatload of other Gold Star Mothers who make a pilgrimage to their sons' graves in France. Ford's comic spirit is seen in the raucous Carolina hillbilly Tilly Hatfield, who befriends Hannah on the boat to France. The earthy, pipe-smoking Tilly has already lost three sons in war. On the boat, in front of the other mothers, Hannah confesses that she doesn't deserve to be in their company, because they truly loved their sons, and she sent hers to his death. As Tilly says to herself: ""She sure musta loved that boy a heap"". Finally, Hannah is rescued from despair by coming to the aid of a young man about to commit suicide. It is someone else's son who leads her down the road to redemption and happiness. Ford employed an unusual method of shooting close-ups for ""Pilgrimage"". He filmed actors looking directly into the camera, thus breaking down the ""third wall"" between the audience and the characters most affected by Hannah's cruelty.  Part of Ford's great success was the use of great actors. He formed a ""stock"" company of favorite actors and friends, who returned again-and-again to supporting roles in John Ford movies. ""Pilgrimage"" is no exception. As the selfish Hannah Jessop, Henrietta Crosman is sometimes melodramatic, but never sentimental. The actor who plays her son, Norman Foster, had a brief run as a leading man in the 1930's, but would go on to a long career as a director, even filming ""Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier"", for ABC television and Walt Disney in the 1950's.  Veteran Robert Warwick plays Major Albertson. His career would stretch another 20 years.  Charley Grapewin plays Dad Saunders. Grapewin became famous six years later as Dorothy's Uncle Henry in 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz"". Hedda Hopper plays Mrs. Worth. In 1936, Hopper began a 28-year stint as a famous newspaper gossip columnist. Her son was actor William Hopper; Paul Drake on TV's ""Perry Mason"". Major Briggs is played by Francis(Frank) Ford, John Ford's older brother. Francis Ford entered movies before John. Francis was head of Universal's shorts and serials department when he gave John Ford his first movie job, as a studio prop boy. John Ford moved up in movie-land, from actor to director, while his rambunctious brother's career declined. A two-fisted drinker, Francis Ford was eventually reduced to small acting jobs in later years. He worked for John Ford in ""The Quiet Man"" in 1952, and died the next year. Tilly Hatfield is played by Lucille La Verne, who was a legendary stage actress and character player in many films. Little is known about her family. La Verne made her Broadway debut in 1888, and entered silent films in 1914. Dont miss her riveting performance as a old hack in the 1935 MGM classic ""A Tale of Two Cities"". In 1937, La Verne provided the voice of the vain, wicked stepmother and her alter-ego, the black-hooded, apple proferring hag, in Walt Disney's first feature film, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". After working on ""Snow White"", La Verne retired from acting, and beacme co--owner of a successful nightclub. She died of cancer in Culver City in 1945. ""Pilgrimage"" is an old-fashioned tear-jerker, but it stands the test of time. It has what movies don't have today. It has beauty and vision. When Kenneth Tynan asked Orson Welles in 1967 which directors he most admired, Welles gave an oft-quoted resonse: ""The old masters. By which I mean John Ford, John Ford, and John Ford"".",5,"You were lost, and now you are found",1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,4908,"['Considered', 'lost', 'certainly', 'forgotten', 'John', 'Ford',

It is Ford and Crosman (and no less than 6 credited screenwriters) melding a characterization of spiritual and humanistic transformation during her ""pilgrimage' to her dead son's WWl military grave in France; the mother's possessiveness so profound that she had enlisted him to serve in trench warfare rather than see him marry. She ultimately softens and embraces her son's widow and child and it is the journey of pain and wisdom that is at the film's core.There is nothing quite like it in the Ford canon for the strength of the female lead, Crossman is brilliant and possesses a naturalism not found in the rest of this film's stilted performances.Perhaps not for the casual film goer, but for collectors Pilgrimage is essential Ford.",5,Pilgrimage is worth the price.,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1021,"['Two', 'very', 'early', 'John', 'Ford', ""'33"", 'respectively', 'Born', 'Reckless', 'dated', 'gangster', 'flick', 'Pilgrimage', 'beautifully', 'wrought', 'tale', 'redemption', 'hardbitten', 'old', 'woman.The', 'performance', 'lead', 'actress', 'Henrietta', 'Crosman', 'rest', 'film', 'dated', 'style', 'Ford', 'Crosman', 'less', '6', 'credited', 'screenwriters', 'melding', 'characterization', 'spiritual', 'humanistic', 'transformation', 'pilgrimage', 'dead', 'son', 'WWl', 'military', 'grave', 'France', 'mother', 'possessiveness', 'so', 'had', 'enlisted', 'serve', 'trench', 'warfare', 'rather', 'see', 'marry', 'ultimately', 'son', 'widow', 'child', 'journey', 'pain', 'wisdom', 'film', 'core.There', 'nothing', 'quite', 'Ford', 'canon', 'strength', 'female', 'lead', 'Crossman', 'brilliant', 'naturalism', 'not', 'found', 'rest', 'film', 'stilted', 'performances.Perhaps', 'not', 'casual', 'film', 'goer', 'collectors', 'Pilgrimage', 'essential', 'Ford']",Pilgrimage / Born Reckless
1110311,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B000WMA6GO,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[0, 0]","As often is the case, I really had no expectations when I bought this set. I decided to take a chance because I normally like John Ford films.Pilgrimage turned out to be a delight. It might be considered corny by a modern audience, but I like old movies. The plot is simple. A hard and domineering woman Mrs. Jessop sends her only son to war, viewing it as a better alternative to having her son marry the girl he loves. The son is killed in France and the mother in her hard and seemingly unfeeling way shuts herself off and doesn't allow herself to mourn or grieve publicly or even privately. The opportunity arises where a large number of gold star mothers are given the chance to visit their sons graves in France. The mothers are an odd yet interesting mix and seemingly united in their grief even ten years after WWI has ended. A series of circumstances awakens Mrs. Jessop's maternal instinct and grief and she comes to realize how wrong her actions were. She returns home and reconciles with her son's girlfriend and her now 10 year old grandson.Henrietta Crosman plays the Mrs. Jessop role. I wasn't familiar with her. Apparently she was a long term stage actress who only appeared in a few films. Too bad that she didn't do more films because she was terrific.Pilgrimage has been remastered beautifully and is an easy movie to watch.The second film Born Reckless stared Edmund Lowe. The only common element between this film and Pilgrimage is a WWI theme. A petty criminal/mobster is given the alternative to a jail term. He can enlist in the army and fight overseas. This will either build his character or send him home in a box. He returns a war hero and continues his career as petty crook.Born Reckless is a bizarre film. It is inconsistent. It could have been directed by several people because the main character never seems fully developed or real. The plot lacks focus and comes across as a tepid mess. It drags on endlessly and is populated with a lot of scenes that go nowhere and make little sense in terms of advancing the story. While this film has a certain appeal as a curiousity, but that's pretty much where it begins and ends.Five stars for Pilgrimage and forget Born Reckless.",5,A Double Set With Two Very Different Films,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,2206,"['often', 'case', 'really', 'had', 'expectations', 'when', 'bought', 'set', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'normally', 'John', 'Ford', 'films.Pilgrimage', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'delight', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'corny', 'modern', 'audience', 'like', 'old', 'movies', 'plot', 'simple', 'hard', 'domineering', 'woman', 'Mrs.', 'Jessop', 'only', 'son', 'war', 'viewing', 'better', 'alternative', 'having', 'son', 'marry', 'girl', 'son', 'killed', 'France', 'mother', 'hard', 'seemingly', 'unfeeling', 'way', 'shuts', 'off', ""n't"", 'allow', 'mourn', 'grieve', 'publicly', 'even', 'privately', 'opportunity', 'where', 'large', 'number', 'gold', 'star', 'mothers', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'visit', 'sons', 'graves', 'France', 'mothers', 'are', 'odd', 'yet', 'interesting', 'mix', 'seemingly', 'united', 'grief', 'even', 'ten', 'years', 'WWI', 'ended', 'series', 'circumstances', 'awakens', 'Mrs.', 'Jessop', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'grief', 'realize', 'how', 'wrong', 'actions', 'were', 'home', 'reconciles', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'now', '10', 'year', 'old', 'grandson.Henrietta', 'Crosman', 'Mrs.', 'Jessop', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Apparently', 'was', 'long', 'term', 'stage', 'actress', 'who', 'only', 'appeared', 'few', 'films', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'films', 'was', 'terrific.Pilgrimage', 'been', 'remastered', 'beautifully', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch.The', 'second', 'film', 'Born', 'Reckless', 'stared', 'Edmund', 'Lowe', 'only', 'common', 'element', 'film', 'Pilgrimage', 'WWI', 'theme', 'petty', 'criminal/mobster', 'given', 'alternative', 'jail', 'term', 'can', 'enlist', 'army', 'fight', 'overseas', 'will', 'build', 'character', 'send', 'home', 'box', 'war', 'hero', 'career', 'petty', 'crook.Born', 'Reckless', 'bizarre', 'film', 'inconsistent', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'several', 'people', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'real', 'plot', 'focus', 'across', 'tepid', 'mess', 'endlessly', 'populated', 'lot', 'scenes', 'go', 'nowhere', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'terms', 'advancing', 'story', 'film', 'certain', 'appeal', 'curiousity', 'pretty', 'much', 'where', 'ends.Five', 'stars', 'Pilgrimage', 'forget', 'Born', 'Reckless']",Pilgrimage / Born Reckless

Born Reckless is a pretty standard gangster movie (interesting for an early look at Randolph Scott and supposedly John Wayne), but Pilgrimmage is the big surprise on this disc - a lesser known Ford film that is a surprisingly mature and moving drama, graced by an outstanding performance by Henrietta Crosman in a complex (for that time) characterization. Ford, although probably most associated with John Wayne westerns (Stagecoach, The Searchers, etc.), displayed his greatest directorial skills when dealing with human drama. Interestingly enough, not one of his four Oscars (The Informer, The Grapes Of Wrath, How Green Was My Valley, and The Quiet Man, all of which are must-see films) was for a western. The film occasionally slides into melodrama, but the viewer needs to remember that this was the acting style of the time.
