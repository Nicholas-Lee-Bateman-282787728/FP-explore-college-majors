1605753,ACW4P33TPKDWW,B00A4TMLNG,Drew from Oregon,"[3, 4]","This review contains spoilers!I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this movie to review.  Below is my review!The Package is a fast paced, action packed thriller that leaves you wanting more at the end.  The movie is so entertaining and moves so fast, you wonder where time went as you will be so entrenched into the story line.  The Package stars Steve Austin playing a character named Tommy Wick who is an ex-nightclub bouncer whose job is to collect debts from people owed to his boss, Big Doug.  You will also see Dolph Lundgren in this movie as well only known as ""The German"".The Package starts out with Tommy (Steve Austin) and his partner going to a bowling alley to collect a debt that a guy named Luis owes to Big Doug.  Naturally, Luis doesn't have the money, so Tommy and his partner are there to send a message and beat Luis' entourage up telling him that he should have the money in 24 hours to pay Big Doug or next time won't be so pretty.As Tommy goes to Big Doug to give him the payments he has collected for the night, Big Doug tells him that he needs a package delivered to ""The German"" (Dolph Lundgren) in Vancouver, B.C.  Big Doug tells Tommy if he does deliver the package, he will wipe out the debt that his brother, who is currently in jail along with many of Big Doug's friends, owes him.  Tommy asks Big Doug what is in the package, but Big Doug refuses to tell him, so Tommy has no clue what's inside, but he decides to deliver it anyway.After that scene, we are introduced to ""The German"".  He meets a guy, who accuses him of stealing, at a restaurant, which is really a trap because there are a few guys waiting in the back with guns ready to shoot German.  German knows this and uses a butter knife to kill a least four people.  This showcases the combat skills German has when faced with oppression.  We also see German start to cough a bit and it appears that he takes a pill.  We get the impression that he is sick at this point in the movie.We then see Tommy arriving at home in Seattle and having a conversation with his wife.  His wife is concerned with the work he is doing for Big Doug.  They have a typical couple conversation about what they would do if they didn't have to worry and had all the money in the world.  We can see here that Tommy loves his wife very much and it appears that he's doing the work for Big Doug because it pays pretty well.The next day, Tommy and his partner are driving up to Vancouver to deliver the package.  His partner is curious as to what is in the package and Tommy tells him that it's better if he himself doesn't know.  After messing with the package a bit and opening cracking it open a little, Tommy's partner starts to say something, but he gets shot in the head and Tommy wrecks the car.  There is a group of people, ex-military contractors, looking for Tommy as they want the package; however, Tommy escapes from the car as quickly as possible and takes refuge in a building.  The ex-military contractors go in the building to find him, which some do, but Tommy beats the pulp out of them and escapes.  As the cops begin to arrive, the ex-military contractors leave and Tommy runs to the nearest gas station and steals a motorcycle and gets away.The movie then cuts to German's house where he walks a doctor to a back room where there is a bunch of hospital equipment and a couple of hospital beds.  The doctor looks concerned and asks German if he has received the package yet.  German informs him that the package is on its way.  At this point in the movie, I'm wondering if the package contains a special, rare drug that German needs to cure his sickness, but I really didn't know at this point either.Tommy realizes that the package is extremely important as there are many other people out to get it and he recognizes the danger he is in.  He calls Big Doug to ask him if someone else can deliver the package.  After the conversation, Tommy decides he has no choice but to deliver the package, so he hitches a ride to Vancouver, B.C.  Upon arriving in Vancouver, someone is watching and calls someone on the phone to inform them that Tommy has arrived.  Eventually, the same ex-military contractors from earlier in the movie catch up to Tommy and tase him and he passes out and they now have him in captivity.While in captivity, Tommy gets tortured; however, he escapes when the chair he is sitting on breaks as the person torturing him was on top of him strangling him at the time.  After killing a few more people, Tommy gets the package back and starts to run out of the building; however, someone shoots him in the back with what appears to be a gun with beanbag rounds.  The first shot makes him fall and the second shot knocks him out.Tommy wakes up on one of the hospital beds in German's house and realizes the doctors took two pints of blood from him.  He sees German sitting in the same room and has a conversation with him.  It turns out, what was in the small, physical package that Tommy was trying to deliver is a pair of football tickets.  German tells Tommy that HE is the package as they share the same blood type, HH, which is rare and blood type HH can only receive from blood type HH people.  It turns out German is sick as he has hemolytic anemia, which is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed, and he needs clean blood.  Tommy realizes that Big Doug knew that Tommy was the package all along as well.  Tommy escapes the hospital bed by biting one of the doctors in the neck and killing everyone else in the room.  He goes to find and kill German.  He finds German and, after some fighting, Tommy shoots him and kills him.  Tommy takes a Mercedes out front that someone else had and escapes.Tommy goes to see Big Doug to have a conversation with him.  We expect Tommy to kill Big Doug as he flips over his table and sits down with Big Doug's gun in his hands.  Big Doug says they can both go about business as usual and forget the incident ever happened, or, they can wish each other godspeed and part ways.  Tommy starts to smile, wishes Big Doug godspeed and walks away, which, in my opinion was an interesting twist in the movie.At the end of the movie, Tommy is seen trading the Mercedes for a truck with an auto dealer.  As Tommy starts to leave, the dealer finds a black bag in the trunk of the Mercedes and gives it to Tommy thinking it's his.  Tommy takes the bag, opens it up and it's full of cash.Overall, I enjoyed this movie.  I was a little skeptical because of Steve Austin as I hadn't seen too many of his movies, but I did know he was a respectable actor due to his time in the WWE.  Dolph Lundgren is, obviously, a veteran and played his part as the bad guy pretty well.  The movie was full of explosions, fists flying, and enough blood to satisfy the manliness in any person, man or woman, watching the film.  This film wasn't loaded with special effects, it was just a great movie overall that had a pretty good story line that kept moving throughout the movie without lagging at any time.  Overall, I give this movie a 4.5 out of 5 stars.Overall rating:  4.5/5 stars",5,Fast-Paced Action Thriller!,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,7114,"['review', 'spoilers', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough',

1605760,A3KI9FDROE4XV6,B00A4TMLNG,"Kane Mercer ""raredisease""","[3, 3]","The Package is a strong entry in the pantheon of Stone Cold films, which already includes several classics. I can safely say to those of you who follow the code of the Stone Cold that the Package is vying with the Condemned, Damage and Expendables for the position of best Stone Cold performance.On the surface, the Package is a quick and dirty exercise aimed at jumping on the already overpopulated B-movie action cash-in band wagon. However, in a refreshing change,  the Package is the same film at its core. This is a film where what you see is what you get. No moralising. No running out of budget. No excuses. Just Stone Cold carnage and a respectable body count.The plot is very simple: Stone Cold is a debt collector. Stone Cold fights people. Stone Cold is sent to deliver a package. Stone Cold gets tangled up with some really bad people. People get killed, some of them by Stone Cold. As you probably read on the package, Dolph is in this film too. Dolph has a plot that runs largely parallel to Stone Cold's: Dolph gets antagonised by some guys. Dolph kills the antagonists. Dolph talks a bunch of stuff about the importance of good nutrition to a few corpses.Both Stone Cold and Dolph are in fine form, dispensing wrath and punishment to all comers. Stone Cold breaks some guys nose with a bowling ball in the first five minutes, which was awesome. I've always liked bowling.What I really liked about this film is that innocent people didn't get a pass like in most namby-pamby Hollywood action. If you were an innocent bystander in this film, chances are you got shot in the face. Hell yeah, give the producers of this film $50 million and let's see what they can really do!So why a four star review - the reveal towards the end of the film is pretty lame and almost derails the whole thing.

If instead you're looking for some high intensity action where fisticuffs and martial arts reign supreme you'll be appeased. This isn't to say Austin is a terrible actor but dialogue is not his claim to fame.THE PACKAGE has Austin portraying a collector/bouncer for a big time criminal making good money while keeping the bad guy off his brother who's in prison. It seems his brother stole money from this same guy who makes Austin a deal: deliver a personal package and the debt is cleared. It seems easy enough so Austin takes on the job.But as we movie fans know nothing is ever quite as easy as it looks. While driving through the backwoods of Washington state, Austin and his partner are ambushed and his partner killed. These are mercenaries hired by Tony, another bad guy, trying to intercept the package. Gunplay and hand to hand combat follow with Austin barely escaping and leaving behind to dead henchmen, one of whom was engaged to another evil operative. And yes, she holds a grudge.Tony is trying to find not just the package but its intended recipient, The German (Dolph Lundgren). While waiting for the delivery of the package The German is taking on Tony's men trying to find out who is behind this hijack. From the scenes involving his handling of the men sent to kill him it's easily deciphered that The German is not a very nice guy, a bit more of a sociopath than anything else.Between time on the road and fighting bad guys you know that Austin will eventually get the package to The German. But just what is in the package that makes it so valuable? The reveal is actually a nice surprise and one you wouldn't expect in a direct to DVD feature. Will there be a showdown between the two superstars of direct to DVD? Of course there is!The movie is well made and offers some nice scenery along the way. Lundgren plays a truly great villain here and the rest of the cast is up to par as well. The story may be simple but again, it's not high art we're talking here. It's kick butt and take name time, head smashing and fist popping, an adrenaline rush of non-stop action with a few slow moments tossed in for recovery. If you're an Austin or Lundgren fan you'll know what to expect. Nothing complicated, just action.

1605765,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00A4TMLNG,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","""The Package"" was one of a handful of movies I readily anticipated the release of. While it ended up not being at all what I expected or hoped for, I found it to be a pretty enjoyable and fairly unique DTV action-drama. Director Jesse Johnson (The Fifth Commandment) isn't Isaac Florentine, but after he's finally developed his own solid style with movies like this, he doesn't need to be: if he keeps up this standard, he'll definitely remain a name to watch, especially if keeps associating with this caliber of action heroes.The story: a mafia enforcer (Steve Austin,Damage) agrees to deliver a mysterious pocketbook to a rival mob boss (Dolph Lundgren,Rocky IV) in exchange for a family member's freedom, but is ambushed en-route by outside forces looking to take possession of the package.The DVD cover hints that the movie may feature Austin and Lundgren's characters teaming up, but this isn't the case. As a matter of fact, they don't even share a scene until the film's last twenty minutes. The story mostly follows Austin as he's pursued by the goons of Paul Daingerfield (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) - most notably martial artists Darren Shahlavi (Ip Man 2) and Jerry Trimble (The Master) - while Lundgren stays in the background and builds the suspense about what's in the package. This particular martial cast is what attracted me to the movie in the first place, with high hopes for plenty of hand-to-hand fight scenes. The actual adrenaline product is mixed: there's some presentable gunplay and a car crash, and while the six fistfights tend to act as the centerpieces, I'd be lying if I said they're everything I had hoped for. Steve Austin's brawls are fun to watch and are shot generally better than a lot of fights these days, but his style cramps that of Shahlavi and Trimble a bit. The showdown with the former remains worth watching for some practical choreography, but I was let down by Jerry's first real fight scene in over a decade.Were there nothing else to the movie, I'd end up giving it three stars, but it has other strengths to fall back on, the most notable of which is the script by Dererk Kolstad. For the most part, it's a straight-forward action yarn, but it's spiced up by a memorable character for Lundgren, some decent suspense en-route to the climax, and a twist I didn't see coming. And while Lundgren's persona may stand out, the amassed acting content of the flick is decisively above-average for this type of movie: off the top of my head, I can think of at least four really strong dramatic scenes, including some for which longtime character performer Eric Keenleyside (The Interpreter) adds his refined talent to. Additionally, there's a few simply cool little scenes and character moments stuck in here and there that you just wouldn't expect, (SPOILER) like when Austin's character cuts an interrogation speech by Paul Daingerfield short by killing him with a single headbutt while tied to a chair. Damn, Steve!I won't predict that this will be one of the best DTV action titles of the year, but it definitely won't be among the worst. Fans of Steve Austin as an action hero definitely have a worthy addition to add to their library, and action fans in general should be appeased by this well put together adventure. Strict martial arts fans can definitely find better, but that's not to say they won't get into the story and characters, too.",4,"""It never troubles the wolf how many sheep there may be""",1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,3393,"['Package', 'was', 'one', 'handful', 'movies', 'readily', 'anticipated', 'release', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'what', 'expected', 'hoped', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'fairly', 'unique', 'DTV', 'action-drama', 'Director', 'Jesse', 'Johnson', 'Fifth', 'Commandment', ""n't"", 'Isaac', 'Florentine', 'finally', 'developed', 'own', 'solid', 'style', 'movies', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'up', 'standard', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'remain', 'name', 'watch', 'especially', 'keeps', 'associating', 'caliber', 'action', 'heroes.The', 'story', 'mafia', 'enforcer', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Damage', 'deliver', 'mysterious', 'pocketbook', 'rival', 'mob', 'boss', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'exchange', 'family', 'member', 'freedom', 'ambushed', 'en-route', 'outside', 'forces', 'looking', 'take', 'possession', 'package.The', 'DVD', 'cover', 'hints', 'movie', 'may', 'feature', 'Austin', 'Lundgren', 'characters', 'teaming', 'up', ""n't"", 'case', 'matter', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'share', 'scene', 'film', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'story', 'mostly', 'Austin', 'pursued', 'goons', 'Paul', 'Daingerfield', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Pet', 'Detective', 'most', 'notably', 'martial', 'artists', 'Darren', 'Shahlavi', 'Ip', 'Man', '2', 'Jerry', 'Trimble', 'Master', 'Lundgren', 'background', 'suspense', 'what', 'package', 'particular', 'martial', 'cast', 'what', 'attracted', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'high', 'hopes', 'plenty', 'hand-to-hand', 'fight', 'scenes', 'actual', 'adrenaline', 'product', 'mixed', 'presentable', 'gunplay', 'car', 'crash', 'six', 'fistfights', 'tend', 'act', 'centerpieces', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'said', ""'re"", 'everything', 'had', 'hoped', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'brawls', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'shot', 'generally', 'better', 'lot', 'fights', 'days', 'style', 'cramps', 'Shahlavi', 'Trimble', 'bit', 'showdown', 'former', 'worth', 'watching', 'practical', 'choreography', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'Jerry', 'first', 'real', 'fight', 'scene', 'decade.Were', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'other', 'strengths', 'fall', 'back', 'most', 'notable', 'script', 'Dererk', 'Kolstad', 'most', 'part', 'straight-forward', 'action', 'yarn', 'spiced', 'up', 'memorable', 'character', 'Lundgren', 'decent', 'suspense', 'en-route', 'climax', 'twist', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'Lundgren', 'persona', 'may', 'stand', 'out', 'amassed', 'acting', 'content', 'flick', 'decisively', 'above-average', 'type', 'movie', 'top', 'head', 'can', 'think', 'least', 'four', 'really', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'including', 'longtime', 'character', 'performer', 'Eric', 'Keenleyside', 'Interpreter', 'refined', 'talent', 'Additionally', 'few', 'simply', 'cool', 'little', 'scenes', 'character', 'moments', 'stuck', 'here', 'there', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'SPOILER', 'when', 'Austin', 'character', 'interrogation', 'speech', 'Paul', 'Daingerfield', 'short', 'killing', 'single', 'headbutt', 'tied', 'chair', 'Damn', 'Steve', 'wo', ""n't"", 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'DTV', 'action', 'titles', 'year', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'worst', 'Fans', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'action', 'hero', 'definitely', 'have', 'worthy', 'addition', 'add', 'library', 'action', 'fans', 'general', 'should', 'be', 'appeased', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'adventure', 'Strict', 'martial', 'arts', 'fans', 'can', 'definitely', 'find', 'better', 'not', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'story', 'characters', 'too']","Package, The"

Tommy has an offer by Big Doug to clear Eddie's debt by delivering a package to ""The German"" (Dolph Lundgren). There are forces out there that want the package for themselves. We don't know what is in the package, until about midpoint, when we can figure it out before they tell us.Dolph is introduced in a restaurant fight scene where he takes down about a half dozen to a dozen guys armed with automatic weapons by using a butter knife. Okay, it's a large butter knife. Tommy likewise has no trouble overcoming automatic weapons with his wits and fist.

1605777,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00A4TMLNG,trebe,"[0, 0]","After specializing in horror, Anchor Bay has been branching out into the action genre, recently producing several films that feature pairs of action stars.  After teaming with Steven Seagal inMaximum Conviction(2012), Steve Austin costars with Dolph Lundgren in The Package (2012), a crime drama which has a few decent action sequences, but not much of a story to hold things together.  It's entertaining on a superficial level, but probably rather unmemorable long term.In order to settle debts owed by his brother, Tommy Wick (Austin) agrees to deliver a ""package"" for underworld figure Big Doug (Eric Keenleyside), to a crime boss known as ""the German"" (Lundgren).  Soon after Wick begins his mission, he is ambushed by a rival group, and eventually captured and tortured.  Even after he manages to escape, Wick finds that the German still has plans for him.While a likable guy, even after have starring roles in many films, former pro-wrestler Steve Austin (The Condemned,Hunt To Kill), remains pretty stiff as an actor.  Despite his athletic skills, he isn't very natural in action scenes either.  There is hope for the man once known as ""Stone Cold"", as co-star Dolph Lundgren (Joshua Tree,Red Scorpion)was once in a similar situation.  Although he'll probably never win any awards, Lundgren's acting has improved over the years, and he's mostly successful, at bringing a little silly humor into his role.While nothing special, The Package probably delivers enough to satisfy Lundgren or Austin fans, although with the focus on their individual exploits, the two stars share little screen time together.",3,"lundgren and austin, take turns kicking ass...",1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,1609,"['specializing', 'horror', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'been', 'branching', 'out', 'action', 'genre', 'recently', 'producing', 'several', 'films', 'feature', 'pairs', 'action', 'stars', 'teaming', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'inMaximum', 'Conviction', '2012', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Package', '2012', 'crime', 'drama', 'few', 'decent', 'action', 'sequences', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'hold', 'things', 'together', 'entertaining', 'superficial', 'level', 'probably', 'rather', 'unmemorable', 'long', 'term.In', 'order', 'settle', 'debts', 'owed', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'Wick', 'Austin', 'deliver', 'package', 'underworld', 'figure', 'Big', 'Doug', 'Eric', 'Keenleyside', 'crime', 'boss', 'known', 'German', 'Lundgren', 'Soon', 'Wick', 'mission', 'ambushed', 'rival', 'group', 'eventually', 'captured', 'tortured', 'Even', 'escape', 'Wick', 'German', 'still', 'plans', 'him.While', 'likable', 'guy', 'even', 'have', 'starring', 'roles', 'many', 'films', 'former', 'pro-wrestler', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Condemned', 'Hunt', 'Kill', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'actor', 'athletic', 'skills', ""n't"", 'very', 'natural', 'action', 'scenes', 'either', 'hope', 'man', 'once', 'known', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'co-star', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Joshua', 'Tree', 'Red', 'Scorpion', 'was', 'once', 'similar', 'situation', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'win', 'awards', 'Lundgren', 'acting', 'improved', 'years', 'mostly', 'successful', 'bringing', 'little', 'silly', 'humor', 'role.While', 'nothing', 'special', 'Package', 'probably', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'Lundgren', 'Austin', 'fans', 'focus', 'individual', 'exploits', 'two', 'stars', 'share', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'together']","Package, The"
