I absolutely loved it.  It is full of beautiful life lessons.  It shows in a profound way the power of imagination, and that magical thinking in children is very healthy and helps them make sense of their world and work through issues and difficulties.  I was touched by so many things.  One was when we saw the face of the giant.  I think that was profound.For parents reading this and wondering if it would be too sad for their children, I think they should know what happens.  My oldest son had been told at school that the girl dies.  I told my kids it would be sad, and that the girl dies and that it is just a movie telling a story.  I think this helped VERY much.  If we had been surprised by the death, which was shocking even though I knew it was eventually going to happen, it would have been very upseting.  My boys were fine and enjoyed the movie.  I am grateful for the beautiful lessons they saw illustrated.  Yes, it is sad.  But so is life.  And for so, so many children life is full of trajedy.  In some cities in this country eighty percent of adolescents have experienced severe violence or family trajedy.  We need to get real.  This movie isn't to traumatize--it's to help show how the human spirit can overcome trajedy.  ALSO, it is important to know that this movie is not at all violent.  The make believe scenes are very mild, and even fun.  The shadows or creatures represent things that are scarey for the children in their lives, and they conquer them!  Also, the commercials for this movie misrepresented its genre, I think.  This is not a movie FILLED with the fast action make believe.  That is a very small part of the movie.

652144,A13YSL2NNQHVSC,B00005JPL5,Atticus Bailey,"[1, 1]","First off let me start by saying READ THE BOOK! It's a great read and its pretty short, and it is a story that you should allow your own mind to create before you watch the movies interpretation.  However, having said that this movie is still pretty good and very close to the book. There are however a few drawbacks at least in my opinion.  Let me mention the good in this movie first, the cast is well chosen and they win you over pretty quickly.  The score is wonderfully created especially during the more sorrowful filled moments in the film. The story is amazing and honestly whether it be a major motion picture or a high school play I think in some way you would find yourself connected.  There were however a few things I felt kept this movie from being in the upper echelon of films.  The acting at times can be a little off, I don't mean the actors/actresses were poor just the delivery of the lines and emotion were odd. A bigger issue for me was the CGI created Terabithia world in which there imaginations are shown on camera.  My problem with this is it was done simply to draw the younger audience with its flashiness. It would have been more charismatic to make the implications of their imaginations and allow the audience to use our imaginations as well. My next issue again has to do with their desire to draw in a younger audience and that is at several times during the film a song is played while for 2 mins we wait around watching just some fill simply so that kid songs can be put into the movie to again draw a younger audience.  This completely breaks the rhthymn of the film in my opinion.  And along these lines the scene where they're painting the house and dancing is terrible.  It is just such a reach to have us believe this as part of the story when it seems like theyre making a music video.

That is the only reason that I gave it 3 stars.  Sitting on a bench at a park and watching all the kids interact is similar and much more entertaining than this movie.

Prettier than the popular cheerleaders, but too different to be accepted, she'd had to live in a fantasy world all ehr own as no one had ever had the time to listen. She was harassed by the nasty girls who would turn into people like the agitator at the last movie. She observed that her neighbor was treated badly by the bullies on the playground and on their school bus. She sat beside him so they'd leave him alone.There's nothing like first love as they transformed an old tree house out in the woods into a magical kingdom of which Leslie was the leader. Both ran like Forrest Gump as they departed the real world of violence on the school bus. The bridge was a hanging rope which they used a la Tarzan on his jungle vines. I wondered how the dog PT got across the flooded creek.As time went by, they became good friends but one day he took a field trip to a museum in the city without letting Leslie know. It was an unexpected treat, an opportunity he could not turn down. Though they were now close emotionally, he kept the trip secret like males tend to do, and he wasn't there when fate played its dirty trick.The founder of Terebithia went alone to their playground but the ""bridge"" broke. Jess felt guilty because he'd been too selfish to invite her along. Had fate been different, he would have taken her to the museum to show off his knowledge and experience. The oen time he wasn't there at a critical moment, she slipped and drown; when Zach took us to see the circus in Huntsville, Alabama, a friend of mine slipped away into oblivion and her mean daughter pulled the plug. Jess went into denial and missed her constantly. She'd been his sunshine and inspiration, and he just could not ""let go.""When an unexpected death hits us, it helps to remembe the good about the person who now is gone. My tribute to Bob Lobertine prompted by a callous state trooper's critical remark -- a letter to the Nashville Tennessean saying we should remember the good about a prominent person and let the bad die with him.

Actually, the movie stays very close to the book and the special effects were minimal, which is good. Having too many special effects would defeat the message of the movie: use your imagination.

652152,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JPL5,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[10, 15]","There's more than one bridge that is lacking in BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. Trying to ascertain who this movie is targeted at is one that many parents won't be able to cross, as well as gaps in almost all the fantasy elements.Teasers and trailers would have most potential viewers believe it to be on-par withThe Lord Of The RingsorNarnia.  Perhaps not in production standards but at least in the story's fantasy elements. Not so. The screenplay and direction seemed to be at odds with the story, trying to infuse more childlike wonder and imagination but being stymied by coherency and some very shabby acting and dialogue.Bridge To Terabithia is based on Katherine Patterson's Newberry Award winning children's book by the same name. Given a wobbly structure by picture standards rather than anything approaching a solid children's story, the film fails not only in entertaining visuals but also in that the themes that run through Patterson's books are never given their comeuppance. We can see them more than feel them, which is a bummer considering how important some of the issues Patterson covers in her novels.Josh Hutcherson (Zathura) stars as Jesse Aarons, a middle school boy with adult responsibilities on his parents' farm. Living in the boondocks, Jesse is the [...] of bullies and jokesters at his school. Finding comfort in his drawings, Jesse immerses himself in them, trying to escape life's cruel realities. He's a loner even amongst his family, where his sisters and parents rarely acknowledge his existence. Then one day a young girl arrives at his school and opens Jesse's mind to the unseen. AnnaSophia Robb is Leslie Burk (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), the daughter to fiction writers who takes a liking to Jesse. Running into the backwoods near their homes, Jesse and Leslie form a friendship based on escapism and fantasy. But the worlds begin colliding as Jesse and Leslie take their made-up world and incorporate its sense of right and wrong on the real one. The results are no big surprise. The bullying stops. Respect is achieved. Toughness grows.The largest problem with the story is that its target audience is a complete mystery. The dialogue is junior enough to be in league with films such asLabyrinthbut the themes are often adult, including extrapolations on the need for God and religion as well as how to deal with an emerging sexual attraction for a teacher, and the death of a student. These dichotomies were just too broad to be ...um ...bridged.The other issue is the out-and-out misconception that this is some sort of visually stunning fantasy movie. It isn't. These elements are few and often incongruous with the trailers that littered screens before its release or on parallel DVDs that beg you to rent or buy this film, too.Bridge To Terabithia isn't for young kids and it will bore and/or anger adults to the point where they'll want to banish the DVD posthaste from whence it came.",2,A Very Wobbly Crossing,1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,2932,"['more', 'one', 'bridge', 'lacking', 'BRIDGE', 'TO', 'TERABITHIA', 'Trying', 'ascertain', 'who', 'movie', 'targeted', 'one', 'many', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'cross', 'as', 'well', 'gaps', 'almost', 'fantasy', 'elements.Teasers', 'trailers', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'potential', 'viewers', 'believe', 'be', 'on-par', 'withThe', 'Lord', 'RingsorNarnia', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'production', 'standards', 'least', 'story', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'Not', 'so', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'seemed', 'be', 'odds', 'story', 'trying', 'infuse', 'more', 'childlike', 'wonder', 'imagination', 'being', 'stymied', 'coherency', 'very', 'shabby', 'acting', 'dialogue.Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'based', 'Katherine', 'Patterson', 'Newberry', 'Award', 'winning', 'children', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Given', 'wobbly', 'structure', 'picture', 'standards', 'rather', 'anything', 'approaching', 'solid', 'children', 'story', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'visuals', 'also', 'themes', 'run', 'Patterson', 'books', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'comeuppance', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'feel', 'bummer', 'considering', 'how', 'important', 'issues', 'Patterson', 'covers', 'novels.Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Zathura', 'Jesse', 'Aarons', 'middle', 'school', 'boy', 'adult', 'responsibilities', 'parents', 'farm', 'Living', 'boondocks', 'Jesse', '[', ']', 'bullies', 'jokesters', 'school', 'Finding', 'comfort', 'drawings', 'Jesse', 'trying', 'escape', 'life', 'cruel', 'realities', 'loner', 'even', 'amongst', 'family', 'where', 'sisters', 'parents', 'rarely', 'acknowledge', 'existence', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'young', 'girl', 'school', 'Jesse', 'mind', 'unseen', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Leslie', 'Burk', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'daughter', 'fiction', 'writers', 'who', 'liking', 'Jesse', 'Running', 'backwoods', 'homes', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'form', 'friendship', 'based', 'escapism', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'begin', 'colliding', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'take', 'made-up', 'world', 'incorporate', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'real', 'one', 'results', 'are', 'big', 'surprise', 'bullying', 'stops', 'Respect', 'achieved', 'Toughness', 'grows.The', 'largest', 'problem', 'story', 'target', 'audience', 'complete', 'mystery', 'dialogue', 'junior', 'enough', 'be', 'league', 'films', 'such', 'themes', 'are', 'often', 'adult', 'including', 'extrapolations', 'need', 'God', 'religion', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'deal', 'emerging', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'teacher', 'death', 'student', 'dichotomies', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'broad', 'be', 'um', 'other', 'issue', 'out-and-out', 'misconception', 'sort', 'visually', 'stunning', 'fantasy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'elements', 'are', 'few', 'often', 'incongruous', 'trailers', 'littered', 'screens', 'release', 'parallel', 'DVDs', 'beg', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', 'too.Bridge', 'Terabithia', ""n't"", 'young', 'kids', 'will', 'bore', 'and/or', 'anger', 'adults', 'point', 'where', ""'ll"", 'want', 'banish', 'DVD', 'posthaste', 'whence', 'came']",Bridge to Terabithia

652155,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B00005JPL5,Bookphile,"[7, 8]","I read the slightest of summaries of this movie in a Time magazine but was never particularly motivated to watch it.  I knew of the novel but had never read it.  Had it not been for my daughter picking it out one night while we rented movies, I may never have seen it and that truly would have been a shame.There was so much that I loved about this movie.  It had so many messages and such sensitivity and yet it was presented in a very plain and straight forward way.  There are clear messages about bullying, about judging others, and about being true to yourself and none of them are presented in a preachy manner.  Though we certainly root for Leslie and Jesse, they are not always the winners in this tale.Jesse has a very hard life and a father who's rather neglectful and none of this is embellished so as to make it seem lighter than it truly is.  When he is mocked because of the hand-me-down sneakers he is forced to wear, we feel the sting of the taunts and the unfairness of them.  Jesse is already beaten down by life, forced to face a harsh reality that holds little enough joy for him.As for Leslie, she remains true to herself but must pay the cost for her refusal to conform.  When she does try to be a revolutionary, there are consequences and it's sad to see the fight drain out of her.  Still, Leslie never gives up hope that there's something better and she never ceases to see the world for its potential as well as its reality.And yet for all the sadness of this film, it is also lovely and uplifting.  The friendship that develops between Leslie and Jesse is truly touching and speaks volumes about the power of the human ability to touch others and to help bring out the best in them.  Watching Leslie and Jesse make their own happiness as they carve out their own little world is remarkable.There is a profoundly sad portion to this film and I was surprised to find myself reduced to a rather serious fit of tears over a movie I thought of as a ""child's"" film.  And yet the tragedy in this movie was not superfluous and is important for children who live in a world that is every bit as real as the one inhabited by us adults.  Sometimes life is unfair, as this movie shows, but even in the midst of tragedy we are capable of doing extraordinary things and reaching out to those whom we have previously neglected.  This is exactly what Jesse does and I think it exemplifies one of the movie's most significant message: there is no way to quantify the importance of simple human kindness.",5,A sad and beautiful tale,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,2513,"['read', 'slightest', 'summaries', 'movie', 'Time', 'magazine', 'was', 'never', 'particularly', 'motivated', 'watch', 'knew', 'novel', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'daughter', 'picking', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'rented', 'movies', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'truly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shame.There', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'loved', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'messages', 'such', 'sensitivity', 'yet', 'was', 'presented', 'very', 'plain', 'straight', 'forward', 'way', 'are', 'clear', 'messages', 'bullying', 'judging', 'others', 'being', 'true', 'none', 'are', 'presented', 'preachy', 'manner', 'certainly', 'root', 'Leslie', 'Jesse', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'winners', 'tale.Jesse', 'very', 'hard', 'life', 'father', 'who', 'rather', 'neglectful', 'none', 'embellished', 'so', 'make', 'seem', 'lighter', 'When', 'mocked', 'hand-me-down', 'sneakers', 'forced', 'wear', 'feel', 'sting', 'taunts', 'unfairness', 'Jesse', 'already', 'beaten', 'down', 'life', 'forced', 'face', 'harsh', 'reality', 'little', 'enough', 'joy', 'him.As', 'Leslie', 'true', 'herself', 'must', 'pay', 'cost', 'refusal', 'conform', 'When', 'try', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'are', 'consequences', 'sad', 'see', 'fight', 'drain', 'her', 'Still', 'Leslie', 'never', 'up', 'hope', 'something', 'better', 'never', 'see', 'world', 'potential', 'as', 'well', 'reality.And', 'yet', 'sadness', 'film', 'also', 'lovely', 'uplifting', 'friendship', 'Leslie', 'Jesse', 'truly', 'touching', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'power', 'human', 'ability', 'touch', 'others', 'help', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'Watching', 'Leslie', 'Jesse', 'make', 'own', 'happiness', 'carve', 'out', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'profoundly', 'sad', 'portion', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'reduced', 'rather', 'serious', 'fit', 'tears', 'movie', 'thought', 'child', 'film', 'yet', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'superfluous', 'important', 'children', 'who', 'live', 'world', 'bit', 'as', 'real', 'one', 'inhabited', 'adults', 'Sometimes', 'life', 'unfair', 'movie', 'even', 'midst', 'tragedy', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'reaching', 'out', 'whom', 'have', 'previously', 'neglected', 'exactly', 'what', 'Jesse', 'think', 'one', 'movie', 'most', 'significant', 'message', 'way', 'quantify', 'importance', 'simple', 'human', 'kindness']",Bridge to Terabithia
652156,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,B00005JPL5,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[3, 4]","""Close your eyes, and keep your mind wide open""The second half of this sentence (keep your mind wide open) is the theme of BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. I make this point right at the beginning because it is the heart of the film. Whether or not it is the main theme of Katherine Paterson's original book, I do not know. But it becomes the main theme of this wonderful Walt Disney produced version. It's a theme that is not handed down in a preachy melodramatic way but simply and well thought out. And the film brings the magical possibilities of the book brilliantly to life with special effects that do not overpower the story or the characters.Characters and story were central to the original book and co-screenwriter David Paterson (the son of the original author) understood this. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) lives with his mother, a strict father (Robert Patrick), and four sisters, including May Belle (Bailee Madison), who he looks at in the beginning as a real pest. He also feels jealousy to May Belle because the father pays more attention to her than to him. Bullied and picked on by his classmates Scott Hoger and Gary Fulcher, and his school's 8th grade bully Janice Avery, Jesse retreats into a world of cartoon drawings, and practices running to prepare for a race at school. He also enjoys his Friday music class with Ms Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel).Everything changes for him when Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) and her parents move next door. Leslie is an intelligent 10 year old who loves to read and write stories. But she becomes an outsider as well when she first beats all the boys in the race, and reveals that her family doesn't have a TV. The bullying in the movie is wisely used not to create sympathy for these two children but to depict the world they live in. Exploring the woods in the back area behind their houses, Jesse and Leslie create their own magical kingdom, where they can be whatever they want and no enemy can defeat them. Their kingdom is called Terabithia, and it is where Jesse learns the amazing possibilities that can happen, by keeping his mind wide open.It is here in Terabithia that the special effects come to play, along with a fascinating opening credits sequence where pencil sketches are practically drawn onto the screen. Trolls, squirrel-like creatures, evil vultures, and odd but amazingly inventive creatures inhabit Terabithia. The effects are created by WETA-Digital, the same FX company behind ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, and the film was shot on location in New Zealand. There is a master shot of the land of Terabithia that is just plain breathtaking. The advertisements focused on these special effects instead of the story, and that looked to me like a wise marketing move.A tragedy happens in the film just like it happens in the book. And in this tragedy the film does not get soppy and gooey, but stays true to the theme. Virtually every character is affected by this tragedy and even Jesse's father finds that he has to look at the relationship with his only son in a different light. A final conversation he has with Jesse is powerful and moving. I had the sense watching this film that keeping his mind wide open is something he has started to realize. The conversation makes Jesse think about his relationship with May Belle. These are two special touches that are not really looked at in the book but add perfectly to the film's theme.I should add another wonderful element in this movie. Zooey Deschanel demonstrates the same beauty and charm she illustrated in both ALMOST FAMOUS and ELF. She also has a wonderful talent with music, and leads the music class in terrific and even catchy numbers. Deschanel's Ms Edmonds is someone who has always kept her mind wide open and admires Jesse's artistic talent. Jesse develops an attraction to Ms Edmonds, but the movie wisely doesn't make that a centerpiece.That said, Disney's big-screen adaptation of BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a terrific film that families can enjoy together. Whether or not you're a huge fan of the classic story (I read it when I was a kid and always loved it), you can enjoy this film not just as a movie adaptation but as a film itself.",5,A wonderful adaptation of a classic book,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,4179,"['Close', 'eyes', 'keep', 'mind', 'wide', 'open', 'second', 'half', 'sentence', 'keep', 'mind', 'wide', 'open', 'theme', 'BRIDGE', 'TO', 'TERABITHIA', 'make', 'point', 'right', 'beginning', 'heart', 'film', 'not', 'main', 'theme', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'original', 'book', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'main', 'theme', 'wonderful', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'produced', 'version', 'theme', 'not', 'handed', 'down', 'preachy', 'melodramatic', 'way', 'simply', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'film', 'magical', 'possibilities', 'book', 'brilliantly', 'life', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'not', 'overpower', 'story', 'characters.Characters', 'story', 'were', 'central', 'original', 'book', 'co-screenwriter', 'David', 'Paterson', 'son', 'original', 'author', 'understood', 'Jesse', 'Aarons', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'mother', 'strict', 'father', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'four', 'sisters', 'including', 'May', 'Belle', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'who', 'beginning', 'real', 'pest', 'also', 'jealousy', 'May', 'Belle', 'father', 'more', 'attention', 'Bullied', 'picked', 'classmates', 'Scott', 'Hoger', 'Gary', 'Fulcher', 'school', '8th', 'grade', 'bully', 'Janice', 'Avery', 'Jesse', 'world', 'cartoon', 'drawings', 'practices', 'running', 'prepare', 'race', 'school', 'also', 'Friday', 'music', 'class', 'Ms', 'Edmonds', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', '.Everything', 'changes', 'when', 'Leslie', 'Burke', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'parents', 'move', 'next', 'door', 'Leslie', 'intelligent', '10', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'read', 'write', 'stories', 'outsider', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'first', 'boys', 'race', 'reveals', 'family', ""n't"", 'have', 'TV', 'bullying', 'movie', 'wisely', 'used', 'not', 'create', 'sympathy', 'two', 'children', 'depict', 'world', 'live', 'Exploring', 'woods', 'back', 'area', 'houses', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'create', 'own', 'magical', 'kingdom', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'want', 'enemy', 'can', 'defeat', 'kingdom', 'called', 'Terabithia', 'where', 'Jesse', 'amazing', 'possibilities', 'can', 'happen', 'keeping', 'mind', 'wide', 'open.It', 'here', 'Terabithia', 'special', 'effects', 'come', 'play', 'fascinating', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'where', 'pencil', 'sketches', 'are', 'practically', 'drawn', 'screen', 'Trolls', 'squirrel-like', 'creatures', 'evil', 'vultures', 'odd', 'amazingly', 'inventive', 'creatures', 'inhabit', 'Terabithia', 'effects', 'are', 'created', 'WETA-Digital', 'same', 'FX', 'company', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'New', 'Zealand', 'master', 'shot', 'land', 'Terabithia', 'just', 'plain', 'breathtaking', 'advertisements', 'focused', 'special', 'effects', 'instead', 'story', 'looked', 'wise', 'marketing', 'move.A', 'tragedy', 'film', 'just', 'book', 'tragedy', 'film', 'not', 'get', 'soppy', 'gooey', 'true', 'theme', 'Virtually', 'character', 'affected', 'tragedy', 'even', 'Jesse', 'father', 'look', 'relationship', 'only', 'son', 'different', 'light', 'final', 'conversation', 'Jesse', 'powerful', 'moving', 'had', 'sense', 'watching', 'film', 'keeping', 'mind', 'wide', 'open', 'something', 'started', 'realize', 'conversation', 'Jesse', 'think', 'relationship', 'May', 'Belle', 'are', 'two', 'special', 'touches', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'looked', 'book', 'perfectly', 'film', 'theme.I', 'should', 'add', 'wonderful', 'element', 'movie', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'same', 'beauty', 'charm', 'illustrated', 'ALMOST', 'FAMOUS', 'ELF', 'also', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'music', 'music', 'class', 'terrific', 'even', 'catchy', 'numbers', 'Deschanel', 'Ms', 'Edmonds', 'someone', 'who', 'always', 'kept', 'mind', 'wide', 'open', 'Jesse', 'artistic', 'talent', 'Jesse', 'attraction', 'Ms', 'Edmonds', 'movie', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'make', 'centerpiece.That', 'said', 'Disney', 'big-screen', 'adaptation', 'BRIDGE', 'TO', 'TERABITHIA', 'terrific', 'film', 'families', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'Whether', 'not', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', 'classic', 'story', 'read', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'always', 'loved', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'film']",Bridge to Terabithia
652157,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00005JPL5,Brian E. Erland,"[10, 14]","Introduction: If you're like me and knew nothing about the 07' release `Bridge to Terabithia' before watching the film I'm sure you were as surprised as I was. This is not a story about elves, fairies, trolls or any other such mythological beings of lore and legend. It is a coming of age tale about a young boy and girl, Jessie (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie (Annasophia Robb) who develop a strong friendship centered around a fantasy kingdom of their own making.Synopis: Terabithia lies in the woods adjacent to the homes of best friends Jessie and Leslie. It is just beyond a rushing stream which they traverse by swinging across using an old rope tied to a tree.  The two find this imaginary land a perfect escape from their daily problems revolving around school bullies, family difficulties and just growing up in general. Unfortunately even an imaginary kingdom can only hold out the harshness of reality for so long. The children are about to learn that some lessons in life are more difficult to accept than others.Positives: The cinematography, sets, special effects and music are superior as you'd expect from a Disney feature. The children are also quite charming, especially the talented Annasophia Robb. She will definitely be heard from in the years ahead.  Lest I forget, Zooey Deschanel plays the part of Miss Edmunds their music/art teacher. Zooey's always a plus to anything she's in.Negatives: Due to a rather dubious advertising campaign promoting this film as a fantasy adventure it has targeted an audience much too young for its slow pace and storyline. Further complicating matters, the characterizations portrayed in the movie are a little too stereotypical and one-dimensional to attract many adult fans. These two demographic miscues leave `Bridge to Terabithia' virtually a movie without an audience.Postscript: So if you're looking for a film in the tradition of `The Chronicles of Narnia' or `The NeverEnding Story' be forewarned, this isn't it. On the other hand, if you're in search of something more in keeping with the mood and message of `Pay It Forward' this film's for you.Rating: 3 1/2 Stars.",3,Some Bridges Are Best Left Uncrossed ~ Harrowing The Terrain Between Two Worlds,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,2129,"['Introduction', ""'re"", 'knew', 'nothing', '07', 'release', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'watching', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'as', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'story', 'elves', 'fairies', 'trolls', 'other', 'such', 'mythological', 'beings', 'lore', 'legend', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'young', 'boy', 'girl', 'Jessie', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Leslie', 'Annasophia', 'Robb', 'who', 'develop', 'strong', 'friendship', 'centered', 'fantasy', 'kingdom', 'own', 'making.Synopis', 'Terabithia', 'woods', 'adjacent', 'homes', 'best', 'friends', 'Jessie', 'Leslie', 'just', 'rushing', 'stream', 'traverse', 'swinging', 'using', 'old', 'rope', 'tied', 'tree', 'two', 'find', 'imaginary', 'land', 'perfect', 'escape', 'daily', 'problems', 'revolving', 'around', 'school', 'bullies', 'family', 'difficulties', 'just', 'growing', 'up', 'general', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'imaginary', 'kingdom', 'can', 'only', 'hold', 'out', 'harshness', 'reality', 'so', 'long', 'children', 'are', 'learn', 'lessons', 'life', 'are', 'more', 'difficult', 'accept', 'others.Positives', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'are', 'superior', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Disney', 'feature', 'children', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'charming', 'especially', 'talented', 'Annasophia', 'Robb', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'heard', 'years', 'ahead', 'Lest', 'forget', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'part', 'Miss', 'Edmunds', 'music/art', 'teacher', 'Zooey', 'always', 'plus', 'anything', 'in.Negatives', 'Due', 'rather', 'dubious', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'promoting', 'film', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'targeted', 'audience', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'slow', 'pace', 'storyline', 'Further', 'complicating', 'matters', 'characterizations', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'one-dimensional', 'attract', 'many', 'adult', 'fans', 'two', 'demographic', 'miscues', 'leave', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'virtually', 'movie', 'audience.Postscript', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'tradition', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'NeverEnding', 'Story', 'be', 'forewarned', ""n't"", 'other', 'hand', ""'re"", 'search', 'something', 'more', 'keeping', 'mood', 'message', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'film', 'you.Rating', '3', '1/2', 'Stars']",Bridge to Terabithia
652158,A3Q2NG43Q04PT3,B00005JPL5,Bulldozer,"[2, 2]","This is one of the best family films I've seen in a very long time. It was only because I was familiar with the novel that I DVR'd the film. It had been awhile since I read the novel, which was about 14 years ago when I was in the 6th grade. So I vaguely remembered the plot and ending, but that really didn't prepare me for the range of emotions I went through as I watched this film. Perhaps not having read the novel in awhile, I didn't have a overly-critical analysis of comparing the book to the film. But, regardless of how you feel about the film's accuracy, this film stands very well on its own as a coming of age tale.AnnaSophie Robb is perfectly cast as Leslie Burke, and I'd also agree with several reviewers that she plays the sort of girl you'd wish you were best friends growing up. She and Josh Hutcherson, playing Jesse, have very good chemistry and their discussions really should dig into some thoughtful thinking for adults as well. And so when the critical scene in the film occurs, well... you really feel for the characters.It's on that note that I challenge some of the reviewers who have criticized this film for being too mature for kids, and too juvenile and campy for adults. I'm an adult, and I really enjoyed this film. And I know I'm not alone.I knew this film didn't focus on adventures in Terabithia, but rather using fantasy to escape a harsher reality. Thus, it didn't bother me that the CGI effects were low-rate.The point of this review is to suggest that while there are some mature issues discussed in this film, many of the best novels for young adults involve mature issues. Harry Potter involves death and violence. Narnia involves death and very violent images. To Kill a Mocking Bird involves discrimination and rape. Parents shouldn't insulate their children from these issues by protecting them in some sort of bubble. These are the sorts of issues that children are curious about. I know when I was young, I was also deeply disturbed by the themes in the novel. But at the same time I was also curious and had endless questions. But, see that's where good parenting or mentors come in. To give perspective and to allow us to face these issues.This movie deserves better than the 3 1/2 star rating on Amazon. If it can make me think long and hard, it should do the same for young children. And unlike Hanna Montana or whatever crap kids are watching these days, there are real, serious issues that are dealt with in this film.",5,Thoughtful and touches the soul,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,2472,"['one', 'best', 'family', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'was', 'familiar', 'novel', 'DVR', ""'d"", 'film', 'had', 'been', 'awhile', 'read', 'novel', 'was', '14', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', '6th', 'grade', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'plot', 'ending', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'prepare', 'range', 'emotions', 'went', 'watched', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'novel', 'awhile', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'overly-critical', 'analysis', 'comparing', 'book', 'film', 'regardless', 'how', 'feel', 'film', 'accuracy', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'own', 'coming', 'age', 'tale.AnnaSophie', 'Robb', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Leslie', 'Burke', ""'d"", 'also', 'agree', 'several', 'reviewers', 'sort', 'girl', ""'d"", 'wish', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'playing', 'Jesse', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'discussions', 'really', 'should', 'dig', 'thoughtful', 'thinking', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'when', 'critical', 'scene', 'film', 'well', 'really', 'feel', 'characters.It', 'note', 'challenge', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'mature', 'kids', 'too', 'juvenile', 'campy', 'adults', ""'m"", 'adult', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone.I', 'knew', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'adventures', 'Terabithia', 'rather', 'using', 'fantasy', 'escape', 'harsher', 'reality', 'Thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'low-rate.The', 'point', 'review', 'suggest', 'are', 'mature', 'issues', 'discussed', 'film', 'many', 'best', 'novels', 'young', 'adults', 'involve', 'mature', 'issues', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'death', 'violence', 'Narnia', 'death', 'very', 'violent', 'images', 'Kill', 'Mocking', 'Bird', 'discrimination', 'rape', 'Parents', 'should', ""n't"", 'insulate', 'children', 'issues', 'protecting', 'sort', 'bubble', 'are', 'sorts', 'issues', 'children', 'are', 'curious', 'know', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'was', 'also', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'themes', 'novel', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'curious', 'had', 'endless', 'questions', 'see', 'where', 'good', 'parenting', 'mentors', 'come', 'give', 'perspective', 'allow', 'face', 'issues.This', 'movie', 'better', '3', '1/2', 'star', 'rating', 'Amazon', 'can', 'make', 'think', 'long', 'hard', 'should', 'do', 'same', 'young', 'children', 'Hanna', 'Montana', 'crap', 'kids', 'are', 'watching', 'days', 'are', 'real', 'serious', 'issues', 'are', 'dealt', 'film']",Bridge to Terabithia

652167,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B00005JPL5,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[3, 3]","It's been a truism for decades that bright and imaginative children will create their own world, especially when the real one does not suit in the least, when distracted or uninvolved parents, quarrelsome siblings, intimidating teachers and playground bullies prove to be all too much. It's all the more tempting to build a castle in the air, and move in. This is what ten-year old pals Jesse and Leslie do, in this beautifully detailed retelling of Katherine Paterson's juvenile classic, about the power of imagination, friendship, family and loss.Jesse (Josh Hutcherson)  is one of five children and the only son in a semi-rural working-class family struggling to make ends meet. He is just beginning to explore the wonders of the artistic world, about which he initially knows very little. He is unhappy at school, despondent at home, where his harried father, played by Robert Patrick seems to want to pay more attention to his younger sister. About the only oasis in the hell of middle school for him are music classes led by Ms. Edmonds ( Zooey Deschanel), who comes in with her boxes of musical instruments every couple of days.And then a new family moves in down the road from his school bus stop, and Jesse meets their only child,  Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) who is just as dreamy and imaginative, but slightly more confident. They are still the oddballs, among their peers, and one day they cross a stream on an old rope swing and discover their enchanted world, which Leslie names ""Terabithia"". They repair a ruined tree-house and people the woods with creatures of their imaginings... creatures and monsters derived from the real-life bullies and monsters of the schoolyard.The special effects are applied delicately in this production and with a sparing hand. The creatures of Terabithia are elusive, almost half-seen out of the corner of the eye. Most of the movie takes place in the real world anyway... the world that Terabithia and the friendship they share in it empowers them to face with increasing confidence.  It is what enables Jesse to cope with the hurt of Leslie's accidental death, about three-quarters of the way through the movie. The very subtle point is made that the adults in Jesse's world; his father and mother, the stern English teacher, and even Leslie's parents are not unloving and inattentive. Rather, they are inarticulate and taken up with the immediate cares of their own lives.  All in all, it's a beautiful, confidently well-constructed movie, about children who seem like real children, not smutty-mouthed midgets, and the sometimes harried and all too human families they are loved by. If you are not weeping into a handful of Kleenex by the time the titles roll, ask someone send over a pint of the milk of human sympathy to your table.The extras in this DVD release are lavish, including a set of commentaries by director Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer  Hal Lieberman, and another with the two young stars, and producer Lauren Levine. There is also a  music video of the theme song ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open"" sung by AnnaSophia Robb. She plays a child of ten convincingly in the movie itself, but in the video can pass as an elfinly pretty woman of about sixteen. She may be the next Lindsay Lohan, but with talent. The feature ""Bringing Terabithia to Life"" is a fascinating close-up of the computer animation work that went into the creatures of Terabithia, not least because it allowed the viewer to actually take a closer look at them than was afforded in the movie. It also gave a good overview of the original conceptual sketches. The second feature ""Behind the Book"" lagged in some of the brief interviews with various fans and authorities in the genre of children's literature. I would have really wanted to see much more of the interview with the book's author, Katherine Paterson. Her insights and comments would have been several times more authoritative and worthwhile, and, should rightfully have been the major portion of this feature.",5,Filling a World Out of Your Own Imagination,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,4013,"['been', 'truism', 'decades', 'bright', 'imaginative', 'children', 'will', 'create', 'own', 'world', 'especially', 'when', 'real', 'one', 'not', 'suit', 'least', 'when', 'distracted', 'uninvolved', 'parents', 'quarrelsome', 'siblings', 'intimidating', 'teachers', 'playground', 'bullies', 'prove', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'tempting', 'build', 'castle', 'air', 'move', 'what', 'ten-year', 'old', 'pals', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'do', 'beautifully', 'detailed', 'retelling', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'juvenile', 'classic', 'power', 'imagination', 'friendship', 'family', 'loss.Jesse', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'one', 'five', 'children', 'only', 'son', 'semi-rural', 'working-class', 'family', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'just', 'beginning', 'explore', 'wonders', 'artistic', 'world', 'initially', 'very', 'little', 'unhappy', 'school', 'despondent', 'home', 'where', 'harried', 'father', 'played', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'want', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'younger', 'sister', 'only', 'oasis', 'hell', 'middle', 'school', 'are', 'music', 'classes', 'led', 'Ms.', 'Edmonds', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'boxes', 'musical', 'instruments', 'couple', 'days.And', 'then', 'new', 'family', 'moves', 'down', 'road', 'school', 'bus', 'stop', 'Jesse', 'only', 'child', 'Leslie', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'who', 'just', 'dreamy', 'imaginative', 'slightly', 'more', 'confident', 'are', 'still', 'oddballs', 'peers', 'one', 'day', 'cross', 'stream', 'old', 'rope', 'swing', 'discover', 'enchanted', 'world', 'Leslie', 'Terabithia', 'repair', 'ruined', 'tree-house', 'people', 'woods', 'creatures', 'imaginings', 'creatures', 'monsters', 'derived', 'real-life', 'bullies', 'monsters', 'schoolyard.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'applied', 'delicately', 'production', 'sparing', 'hand', 'creatures', 'Terabithia', 'are', 'elusive', 'almost', 'half-seen', 'corner', 'eye', 'Most', 'movie', 'place', 'real', 'world', 'anyway', 'world', 'Terabithia', 'friendship', 'share', 'face', 'increasing', 'confidence', 'what', 'Jesse', 'cope', 'hurt', 'Leslie', 'accidental', 'death', 'three-quarters', 'way', 'movie', 'very', 'subtle', 'point', 'made', 'adults', 'Jesse', 'world', 'father', 'mother', 'stern', 'English', 'teacher', 'even', 'Leslie', 'parents', 'are', 'not', 'unloving', 'inattentive', 'are', 'inarticulate', 'taken', 'up', 'immediate', 'cares', 'own', 'lives', 'beautiful', 'confidently', 'well-constructed', 'movie', 'children', 'who', 'seem', 'real', 'children', 'not', 'smutty-mouthed', 'midgets', 'sometimes', 'harried', 'too', 'human', 'families', 'are', 'loved', 'are', 'not', 'weeping', 'handful', 'Kleenex', 'time', 'titles', 'roll', 'ask', 'someone', 'send', 'pint', 'milk', 'human', 'sympathy', 'table.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'lavish', 'including', 'set', 'commentaries', 'director', 'Gabor', 'Csupo', 'writer', 'Jeff', 'Stockwell', 'producer', 'Hal', 'Lieberman', 'two', 'young', 'stars', 'producer', 'Lauren', 'Levine', 'also', 'music', 'video', 'theme', 'song', 'Keep', 'Mind', 'Wide', 'Open', 'sung', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'child', 'ten', 'convincingly', 'movie', 'video', 'can', 'pass', 'elfinly', 'pretty', 'woman', 'sixteen', 'may', 'be', 'next', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'talent', 'feature', 'Bringing', 'Terabithia', 'Life', 'fascinating', 'close-up', 'computer', 'animation', 'work', 'went', 'creatures', 'Terabithia', 'not', 'least', 'allowed', 'viewer', 'actually', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'was', 'afforded', 'movie', 'also', 'gave', 'good', 'overview', 'original', 'conceptual', 'sketches', 'second', 'feature', 'Book', 'lagged', 'brief', 'interviews', 'various', 'fans', 'authorities', 'genre', 'children', 'literature', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'interview', 'book', 'author', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'insights', 'comments', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'times', 'more', 'authoritative', 'worthwhile', 'should', 'rightfully', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'portion', 'feature']",Bridge to Terabithia

652172,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPL5,Chris Pandolfi,"[15, 18]","On the surface, the concept for ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is quite sad: it centers on two adolescents, both of which are lonely and misunderstood. They then bond and create their own fantasy world, one that reinterprets the harsh realities of their daily lives into extraordinary creatures and settings. It's very easy to think that such escapism isn't healthy in a relationship, especially in one that's formed during such a dynamic and turbulent stage of development. But there's so much more going on here, so many different themes, ideas, and commentaries that are at work. This is not a light and airy children's fable of princes and princesses, nor does it attempt to sugarcoat everything that's even remotely unpleasant in this world. This is an incredibly powerful story of friendship, the fortitude of the imagination, and the strength to overcome adversity.The first of the two adolescents is Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson). He doesn't exactly live an ideal life; not only does his family barely live from paycheck to paycheck as farmers, they also virtually ignore him. Going to school is even worse; he hasn't any friends, and he's at the mercy of a couple of school bullies. One sits behind him in class, yelling things like, ""Beep! Beep! Beep! That's my loser detector!"" Jesse has two forms of escape. One is running, which he hopes to perfect so he can embarrass anyone who gave him a hard time. The other is drawing; he carries a sketchpad wherever he goes, and he frequently fills a page with fantastical creatures of all shapes, sizes, and colors.The second adolescent is Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a free spirit in every sense. Because she was able to run faster than any of the boys, Jessie initially feels threatened by her. But then the class is asked to write a one-page essay on their favorite hobbies. The teacher asks Leslie to read hers aloud due to her fluid, descriptive language. Both Jessie and the audience immediately understand that the teacher made the right decision; as she reads an incredibly mature and creative essay on scuba diving, he visualizes what she's describing. Fish swim in his eyes. Bubbles exit her mouth and float away. At that point, the connection is made; she expresses herself through language while he does so through art. Both rely heavily on their imaginations. These two were meant to be in each other's lives.In wanting to escape the monotony and pain of the everyday world, the two run into the woods, swing across a rope, and create a world of their own. Leslie calls it Terabithia, a magical kingdom imprisoned by the elusive Dark Master. She and Jessie have been sent to free the Terabithians and restore peace. At first, Jesse has a hard time visualizing this fantastic world. But then Leslie gives him a piece of advice: ""Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open."" Suddenly, everything becomes clear, not just for Jessie, but for the audience, as well. They incorporate an abandoned tree house and the surrounding trees and animals into their world: the squirrels and birds become minions of the Dark Master (interestingly, these evil creatures say things like ""Beep! Beep! Beep!""); the dragonflies become the army sent to protect Jessie and Leslie; the trees become gigantic trolls.They retreat to this world as often as they can, despite the demands of school, family, and everyday living. This is something Jesse's father (Robert Patrick) has a difficult time understanding; while he is at heart a good man, having bills to pay and a family to feed leaves no room for an imagination. He wants his son to get his head out of the clouds and pay attention to his chores, his homework, and the welfare of the family. At one point, Jesse misplaces his father's keys; when they seem to be permanently lost, the only option is to replace them all and buy a new set of locks. This prompts his father to shout, ""Why don't you just draw me some money?""Leslie's parents (Latham Gaines and Judy McIntosh) are interesting; like their daughter, they have active imaginations and spend most of their time writing. Surprisingly, having so much in common hasn't brought the three of them together. If anything, it's driving them further apart; her parents are always too absorbed in their work to notice her. This isn't to say that they--or Jessie's parents, for that matter--are bad people; I never once got the sense that they were willfully neglectful, despite not being as attentive as they should be. I saw them as people so wrapped up in everyday life that they've forgotten how to actually live. For this reason, Jessie and Leslie are viewed differently; their minds are transcendent.Truth be told, transcendence is one of the movie's most important themes. Consider the character of Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton); she's initially portrayed as a good-for-nothing bully, pushing everyone around for no reason other than because she can. She steals people's food. She charges admission to the bathroom. She unfairly accuses Jessie of things he didn't do. At first, we're not supposed to care about her. But then Leslie hears her crying in the girls' bathroom. After some coaxing, she finally works up the courage to talk to her. As it turns out, Janice is a deeply hurt soul, the product of an abusive father. I won't say whether or not this appeals to Janice's better nature, but I will say that the willingness to explore such an issue makes for a deeper, more satisfying experience.Despite everything I've been saying, I fear that this review hasn't succeeded in conveying just how amazing ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is. It's amazing as an examination of the connections certain people make. It's amazing as a testament to the endless possibilities of the imagination. It's amazing as a message to think freely and to not be bogged down. We need this kind of film in our lives, if not for the sake of entertainment, then for the sake of being emotionally rejuvenated. I find myself going back to Leslie's advice: ""Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open."" Not only do I urge you to see this film, I also urge you to follow that piece of advice as you watch.",5,A World of Pure Imagination,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,6128,"['surface', 'concept',

652175,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPL5,"Cloud ""...""","[6, 8]","Personally, I believe one of the reasons for Terabithia's relative underwhelming box-office was its marketing campaign. From the trailers and the initial buzz, it sounded like it was going to be a sort of spiritual follow-up to Chronicles of Narnia with big effects, action set-pieces and the like. But when a family film with human elements mixed in with creatures now and then came out, people were like ""wha? where's all the flashy stuff?"" It's too bad since, on occasion the film has a few flaws, this is actually quite an entertaining film even if you don't watch with kids.Jess is one of those kids that grows up with in a hard-working family that struggles to make ends meet (just a suggestion: maybe not have so many kids?). Secondhand clothes and can't even get a new pair of shoes, he's picked on a lot at school. Enter Leslie who is of a more wealthier family but her quirky likes and attitudes gets her much disdain from others also. But with Jess's love for art and Leslie's overactive imagination, the 2 quickly bond and using the woods nearby their houses, they imagine a fantasy world named Terabithia with creatures and various races and start to learn about growing up and making long-lasting friendships.Now, I will admit that the more fantasy aspects of the story might be seen as out of place. If you're putting in effects, why not go full-throttle right? But that's not the point here which uses the Terabithia world to show kids imagining to escape their real lives. Bullies take on the forms of different races in their make-believe world and adults who don't know how to deal with children who are growing older. But it sort of livens up the film by showing the Weta effects since if they were taken out, this thing would be schmaltzy like crazy. It's mainly story-driven which might make it that sort of catch-22 feeling: too character driven for the younger crowd and not enough wonder for the older crowd.It's also great to see that the bulk of the film is focused on 2 actors who are NOT annoying. While not a flashy role, Josh Hutcherson plays that character who's surprised yet down-to-earth about the real world and the fantasy one without overplaying one of them. Getting the more flashier role is AnnaSophia Robb who reminds me of a younger Natalie Portman who has quite a stage presence although her more wilder flights of fancy could be dialed down since she always seems ""on"". Also kudos for casting the way-too-adorable-to-be-real Zooey Deschanel and Robert Patrick playing Jess's dad.I should mention the ending since that's what got the biggest attention. It follows the book as far as tone and although it's quite a big development in the film, I can understand why people won't like it since kid movies aren't meant to be this ""heavy"". But considering many of us remember Bambi's mother and watching those kind of films, here it makes sense and handled perfectly.I'd recommend it to kids although I'm not sure what they'll think of it. It's not as visually exciting as Narnia or cool as Harry Potter but for an adult, it's quite enjoyable so at least if your kids don't like it, at least you can.",4,Quite delightful for a family film,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,3138,"['Personally', 'believe', 'one', 'reasons', 'Terabithia', 'relative', 'underwhelming', 'box-office', 'was', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'trailers', 'initial', 'buzz', 'sounded', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'sort', 'spiritual', 'follow-up', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'big', 'effects', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'like', 'when', 'family', 'film', 'human', 'elements', 'mixed', 'creatures', 'now', 'then', 'came', 'out', 'people', 'were', 'wha', 'where', 'flashy', 'stuff', 'too', 'bad', 'occasion', 'film', 'few', 'flaws', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'film', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'kids.Jess', 'one', 'kids', 'up', 'hard-working', 'family', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'just', 'suggestion', 'maybe', 'not', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'Secondhand', 'clothes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'new', 'pair', 'shoes', 'picked', 'lot', 'school', 'Enter', 'Leslie', 'who', 'more', 'wealthier', 'family', 'quirky', 'likes', 'attitudes', 'much', 'disdain', 'others', 'also', 'Jess', 'love', 'art', 'Leslie', 'overactive', 'imagination', '2', 'quickly', 'bond', 'using', 'woods', 'nearby', 'houses', 'imagine', 'fantasy', 'world', 'named', 'Terabithia', 'creatures', 'various', 'races', 'start', 'learn', 'growing', 'up', 'making', 'long-lasting', 'friendships.Now', 'will', 'admit', 'more', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'place', ""'re"", 'putting', 'effects', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'full-throttle', 'right', 'not', 'point', 'here', 'Terabithia', 'world', 'show', 'kids', 'imagining', 'escape', 'real', 'lives', 'Bullies', 'take', 'forms', 'different', 'races', 'make-believe', 'world', 'adults', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'growing', 'older', 'sort', 'film', 'showing', 'Weta', 'effects', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'schmaltzy', 'crazy', 'mainly', 'story-driven', 'might', 'make', 'sort', 'catch-22', 'feeling', 'too', 'character', 'driven', 'younger', 'crowd', 'not', 'enough', 'wonder', 'older', 'crowd.It', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'bulk', 'film', 'focused', '2', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'NOT', 'annoying', 'not', 'flashy', 'role', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'character', 'who', 'surprised', 'yet', 'down-to-earth', 'real', 'world', 'fantasy', 'one', 'overplaying', 'one', 'Getting', 'more', 'flashier', 'role', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'who', 'younger', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'quite', 'stage', 'presence', 'more', 'wilder', 'flights', 'fancy', 'could', 'be', 'dialed', 'down', 'always', 'Also', 'kudos', 'casting', 'way-too-adorable-to-be-real', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'playing', 'Jess', 'dad.I', 'should', 'mention', 'ending', 'what', 'got', 'biggest', 'attention', 'book', 'as', 'far', 'tone', 'quite', 'big', 'development', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'kid', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'heavy', 'considering', 'many', 'remember', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'watching', 'kind', 'films', 'here', 'sense', 'handled', 'perfectly.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'kids', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', ""'ll"", 'think', 'not', 'visually', 'exciting', 'Narnia', 'cool', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'adult', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'so', 'least', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'least', 'can']",Bridge to Terabithia

652181,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B00005JPL5,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[0, 1]","Based uponthe award-winning bookby Katherine Paterson, Bridge to Terabithia is a touching film about the bond between two children, both of them outcasts, who learn the importance of friendship and the power of imagination. The screenplay was written by Jeff Stockwell and co-written by David Paterson, the author's son, so the film remains quite faithful to the spirit of the book. The director, Gabor Csupo, handles the emotionally charged story with skill and sensitivity, which only heightens the impact of the events therein.Jess Aarons has two passions in life: drawing and running. He draws so that he can escape into a world of his own, so that he can escape the demands of his stern father and constant harassment from his sisters, and the bullying he endures at school. He runs because he wants to be the fastest boy at his school, which in his eyes is the only way to win the respect of his peers and his father. But his dream of being the fastest runner is dashed to pieces when his new next-door neighbor, Leslie Burke, beats him in the race on the first day of school. At first, Jess holds a grudge against Leslie. That changes when he discovers her free-spirited nature, which earns her the reputation of being weird. Together, Jess and Leslie create an imaginary world where they can be themselves without fear of social ostracization. They become the closest of friends and they look out for one another. Still, their friendship differences sometimes cause conflict. Jess' family is large and is struggling financially, while Leslie's family comprises only of her parents and her and they are wealthy, and Jess' family goes to church, but Leslie's doesn't. In spite of these differences their mutual respect and admiration blossoms into innocent, unconditional love. However this time of happiness is intruded upon by a horrible accident, which leaves Jess angry and questioning his faith. He is ultimately strengthened by his friendship with Leslie, and he begins to reach out to other people, even those that he never would have before.It's unfortunate, but when Walt Disney Studios and Walden media advertised this film, they presented it as being a fantasy/adventure film. This is hardly the case. Bridge to Terabithia is a family film about the problems of life and the inevitable and painful lessons we have to learn in order to grow. It's a film about childhood innocence and the loss of that innocence, as we mature into adulthood. But most importantly, the film is about letting your imagination carry you away from your troubles just long enough for you to find the solutions, and about letting your love free you from your fears. Bridge to Terabithia is a film that will move its viewers, both the young and the young at heart.The story is propelled by the talented cast, especially Josh Hutcherson as Jess, AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie, Robert Patrick as Josh's father, Jack and Zooey Deschanel as Josh's teacher, Ms. Edmunds (whose beautifully emotive blue eyes illuminate the screen in every scene she's in).The DVD includes these bonus features: Digital Imagination featurette, Behind the Scenes featurette, Keep Your Mind Wide Open music video by AnnaSophia Robb, two audio commentaries with cast and crew, and previews.Also recommended:My GirlThe Indian in the CupboardFly Away HomeThe MightyPay it ForwardHolesThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince CaspianCharlotte's Web",4,Friendship and Hardship,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,3459,"['Based', 'uponthe', 'award-winning', 'bookby', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'touching', 'film', 'bond', 'two', 'children', 'outcasts', 'who', 'learn', 'importance', 'friendship', 'power', 'imagination', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Jeff', 'Stockwell', 'co-written', 'David', 'Paterson', 'author', 'son', 'film', 'quite', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'book', 'director', 'Gabor', 'Csupo', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'story', 'skill', 'sensitivity', 'only', 'impact', 'events', 'therein.Jess', 'Aarons', 'two', 'passions', 'life', 'drawing', 'running', 'so', 'can', 'escape', 'world', 'own', 'so', 'can', 'escape', 'demands', 'stern', 'father', 'constant', 'harassment', 'sisters', 'bullying', 'school', 'be', 'fastest', 'boy', 'school', 'eyes', 'only', 'way', 'win', 'respect', 'peers', 'father', 'dream', 'being', 'fastest', 'runner', 'dashed', 'pieces', 'when', 'new', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Leslie', 'Burke', 'race', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'first', 'Jess', 'grudge', 'Leslie', 'changes', 'when', 'free-spirited', 'nature', 'reputation', 'being', 'weird', 'Together', 'Jess', 'Leslie', 'create', 'imaginary', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'fear', 'social', 'ostracization', 'become', 'closest', 'friends', 'look', 'out', 'one', 'Still', 'friendship', 'differences', 'sometimes', 'cause', 'conflict', 'Jess', 'family', 'large', 'struggling', 'financially', 'Leslie', 'family', 'only', 'parents', 'are', 'wealthy', 'Jess', 'family', 'church', 'Leslie', ""n't"", 'spite', 'differences', 'mutual', 'respect', 'admiration', 'blossoms', 'innocent', 'unconditional', 'love', 'However', 'time', 'happiness', 'intruded', 'horrible', 'accident', 'Jess', 'angry', 'questioning', 'faith', 'ultimately', 'strengthened', 'friendship', 'Leslie', 'reach', 'out', 'other', 'people', 'even', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'before.It', 'unfortunate', 'when', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'Walden', 'media', 'advertised', 'film', 'presented', 'being', 'fantasy/adventure', 'film', 'hardly', 'case', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'family', 'film', 'problems', 'life', 'inevitable', 'painful', 'lessons', 'have', 'learn', 'order', 'grow', 'film', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'loss', 'innocence', 'mature', 'adulthood', 'most', 'importantly', 'film', 'letting', 'imagination', 'carry', 'away', 'troubles', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'find', 'solutions', 'letting', 'love', 'free', 'fears', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'film', 'will', 'move', 'viewers', 'young', 'young', 'heart.The', 'story', 'propelled', 'talented', 'cast', 'especially', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Jess', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Leslie', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Josh', 'father', 'Jack', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Josh', 'teacher', 'Ms.', 'Edmunds', 'beautifully', 'emotive', 'blue', 'eyes', 'illuminate', 'screen', 'scene', '.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'Digital', 'Imagination', 'featurette', 'Scenes', 'featurette', 'Keep', 'Mind', 'Wide', 'Open', 'music', 'video', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'crew', 'previews.Also', 'recommended', 'GirlThe', 'Indian', 'CupboardFly', 'Away', 'HomeThe', 'MightyPay', 'ForwardHolesThe', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'WardrobeThe', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Prince', 'CaspianCharlotte', 'Web']",Bridge to Terabithia

Nor am I being sarcastic. Bridge to Terabithia is truly a legitimate film to study in a college psychology course dealing with these issues.  It shows the adults  in the story trying their best to help the surviving child cope with an all too common tragedy -  death by drowning of a friend.However, this film is overwhelming with grief.  I have enough in my own personal life, as many of us do, that I don't need to pay to watch it on the big screen, too.  I'm not asking for only mindless entertainment. But when out-of-the-blue, in the middle of the story, in what started off as a delightful fantasy - turns into a gloomy melodrama - then I have a problem reconciling my need for entertainment with the filmmaker's need to demoralize his or her audience!I also want to make it clear this movie is not appropriate for young children, unless you want to expose them to the tragedy of sudden death, and all its raw emotions.Its extremely rare that a film leaves me in such a sour mood. Perhaps it's because, as a young teen, a classmate of mine drowned since he did not know how to swim. A stupid way to die - to put it mildly.

At the last five minutes of the film, he tries to escape to this land of abstract creatures and we get to see all these bizarre creatures of this fantasy world, but by then, the movie is over.

Well, yeah. It's based on a book, and if they hadn't been faithful to the book's plot, there would have been just as many people complaining bitterly. So in a way, the filmmakers were in a double bind. That said, at least separate the film from the way it was marketed. Give the marketing people two stars and a spanking, since they led lots of people to think the movie was a lighthearted fantasy - but can we try to examine the movie on its own merits?Many children and young adult classics feature a death, either of an animal or a human. Particularly if the book is a Major Award Winner, it doesn't just show how fun it is to be a child but grapples with serious issues. That's partly why it won the award and acclaim in the first place. The Narnia books are far from lighthearted fantasies either, although they can be read that way. They, too, examine friendship and betrayal. But they are set in a magic land, while ""Terabithia"" is set in the real world.The actors in the new version of ""Terabithia"" all do a fantastic job, particularly the young ones, like Bailee Madison as Jess's spunky younger sister. The movie's storyline stuck so closely to the book that the invented scenes felt a little out of place. Perhaps that when it deparated from just showing the developing of two children's friendship, and put in special effects, it felt false. Even if they were brief, they seemed out of place, like the movie makers were trying to placate their young audience, who would presumably be unhappy without special effects.The montages also grated on me, because they were so Hollywood and unnecessary. Why must every movie character break into an impromptu song and dance routine? And why did the treehouse have to look like set designers were competing for an Oscar? I don't know if kids still make treehouses anymore, but mine as a kid sure looked primitive in comparision.In conclusion, it's a lot better than most kids' movies today - with nary a fart joke - but that's not saying much. There's no cussing or drinking, but there is the aforementioned death, which may upset sensitive viewers.

Everyone has different tastes, and different ideas of what constitutes a good film. But ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is one of those films that, for me at least, crosses all boundaries and has something to offer to each and every person.I won't recap the plot, as I'm sure you will find plenty of other reviews here that do just that. But first I have to say that the young leads in this movie, Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, are the heart and soul of this movie. Little Bailee Madison also hold her own. Too often these days filmmakers rely on the dazzling CGI and the heart-pounding action sequences to drive the story. But in this film, whether by intent or not I can't say for sure, these kids take the reigns from the very start and they drive the story forward with the skill that many far older actors could stand to learn.""Bridge to Terabithia"" reminds me of films like ""Old Yeller,"" and of books like ""Where the Red Fern Grows,"" with a bit of ""The Wizard of Oz"" wonder thrown in for good measure. Yes, there is sadness and loss in this movie, and I know that turns some people off. But there is sadness and loss in the real world, and try as we might, sometimes it hits so close to home that we can't protect our children from it. I would not suggest it for very little kids, or for those who are fragile emotionally. But there are lessons to be learned from this film, about friendship and love and feeling like a freak or an outsider (I could tell you stories about the last item for sure!), and also on how to deal with grief and loss. Those aren't things you learn after you become an adult. Those are things we must learn when we're young and wide-eyed and open-minded. Those are the lessons that help us become adults.""Bridge to Terabithia"" is one of those films that you really should let you children see. And I suggest that you sit down and watch it with them. It's rare to see a film that can actually foster the growth of family bonds and also provide life lessons for your kids in a fun and exciting way. Don't miss this little gem of a film.

652208,A34FEX6IPQL95G,B00005JPL5,"Greg C. Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[2, 2]","This movie is much like Pan's Labyrinth but not as dark and dramatic with the storytelling. When seeing the original trailer for both of these films we thought that these movies would be like a Never Ending story or more recently Chronicles of Narni. A majority of the film critics believed that the trailer to Bridge to Terabithia was very misleading because of the fantasy world that you see in the preview. We at cinemaguys.com also were misinformed but never the less; we were satisfied with this film's intellectual and the adult means of exploring fantasy through the story telling--as we were for Pan's Labyrinth.Our movie focuses on the story of two elementary school children who are in the sixth grade. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie Burke (Anna Sophia Robb) are both artistic students; Jesse likes to draw and Leslie likes to write about fantasy--like her parents. They share similar difficulties of getting along with their peers in school, as well as their respective families because of their unambiguous imaginations--especially the girl. To escape from the bullies and along with their family circumstances, Leslie invites Jesse into her fantasy world of Terabithia but in order to get there they must travel into the woods, and cross a stream with a rope. Once across they find an old tree house and together they make the fantasy world of Terabithia come to life. How will this flight of the imagination affect their relationships with the ""real world?""The first fantasy drama--geared towards the family--where the movie does not have to rely on the stereotypical fantasy theme that were so accustomed to seeing along with the special effects, to help the story line to be successful. The writer and director implement fantasy--as an educational building block--to express a student's self-confidence.For example, The boy is constantly being ridicule whether it is by his family (his father) or his peers for being too much of a loner--no social skills--and more importantly for his colorful imagination when it comes to his art. Because of this, his classmates as well as own family--his father mainly--become bullies in his life not physically but mentally.That is where Leslie's becomes an important attribute in the story telling because through her mind she enables the story of Terabithia to erect his courage when he is facing these imaginary creatures. As the movie progresses, he learns how to handle his problems that he faces against theses creatures: at first through aggression but then through kindness, through his fantasy experience. Through his acquaintance with these creatures, he learns to deal with these bullies, who are present in his everyday life.Leslie's fantasy world in the end brings Jesse, the courage that he always was lacking and makes him develop into sociable young man.Movies about fantasy do not always have to be like a Never Ending story or Chronicles of Narnia to stir the imagination of children and their families alike. This movie delivers because of the message of self-worth, and not just to benefit Jesse, but also through the other characters that are important in his life.Permission granted because of these significant reasons: how fantasy is explored in an intellectual manner through the character development in Jesse and Leslie, through the theme of Pan's Labyrinth, but is given to us in a more unsophisticated way-- think of it as Pan Lite for kids. The most imperative reason, because it brings back the imagination we once were accustomed to when we were kids.",5,This movie is much like Pan's Labyrinth but not as dark and dramatic with the storytelling.,1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,3547,"['movie', 'much', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'not', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'storytelling', 'When', 'seeing', 'original', 'trailer', 'films', 'thought', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'Never', 'Ending', 'story', 'more', 'recently', 'Chronicles', 'Narni', 'majority', 'film', 'critics', 'believed', 'trailer', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'was', 'very', 'misleading', 'fantasy', 'world', 'see', 'preview', 'cinemaguys.com', 'also', 'were', 'misinformed', 'never', 'less', 'were', 'satisfied', 'film', 'intellectual', 'adult', 'exploring', 'fantasy', 'story', 'telling', 'were', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth.Our', 'movie', 'story', 'two', 'elementary', 'school', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'sixth', 'grade', 'Jesse', 'Aarons', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Leslie', 'Burke', 'Anna', 'Sophia', 'Robb', 'are', 'artistic', 'students', 'Jesse', 'draw', 'Leslie', 'write', 'fantasy', 'parents', 'share', 'similar', 'difficulties', 'getting', 'along', 'peers', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'respective', 'families', 'unambiguous', 'imaginations', 'especially', 'girl', 'escape', 'bullies', 'family', 'circumstances', 'Leslie', 'Jesse', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Terabithia', 'order', 'get', 'there', 'must', 'travel', 'woods', 'cross', 'stream', 'rope', 'Once', 'find', 'old', 'tree', 'house', 'together', 'make', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Terabithia', 'come', 'life', 'How', 'will', 'flight', 'imagination', 'affect', 'relationships', 'real', 'world', 'first', 'fantasy', 'drama', 'geared', 'family', 'where', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'rely', 'stereotypical', 'fantasy', 'theme', 'were', 'so', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'along', 'special', 'effects', 'help', 'story', 'line', 'be', 'successful', 'writer', 'director', 'implement', 'fantasy', 'educational', 'building', 'block', 'express', 'student', 'self-confidence.For', 'example', 'boy', 'constantly', 'being', 'ridicule', 'family', 'father', 'peers', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'loner', 'social', 'skills', 'more', 'importantly', 'colorful', 'imagination', 'when', 'art', 'classmates', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'family', 'father', 'mainly', 'become', 'bullies', 'life', 'not', 'physically', 'mentally.That', 'where', 'Leslie', 'becomes', 'important', 'attribute', 'story', 'telling', 'mind', 'story', 'Terabithia', 'erect', 'courage', 'when', 'facing', 'imaginary', 'creatures', 'movie', 'how', 'handle', 'problems', 'theses', 'creatures', 'first', 'aggression', 'then', 'kindness', 'fantasy', 'experience', 'acquaintance', 'creatures', 'deal', 'bullies', 'who', 'are', 'present', 'everyday', 'life.Leslie', 'fantasy', 'world', 'end', 'Jesse', 'courage', 'always', 'was', 'lacking', 'develop', 'sociable', 'young', 'man.Movies', 'fantasy', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'be', 'Never', 'Ending', 'story', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'stir', 'imagination', 'children', 'families', 'alike', 'movie', 'message', 'self-worth', 'not', 'just', 'benefit', 'Jesse', 'also', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'important', 'life.Permission', 'granted', 'significant', 'reasons', 'how', 'fantasy', 'explored', 'intellectual', 'manner', 'character', 'development', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'theme', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'given', 'more', 'unsophisticated', 'way', 'think', 'Pan', 'Lite', 'kids', 'most', 'imperative', 'reason', 'back', 'imagination', 'once', 'were', 'accustomed', 'when', 'were', 'kids']",Bridge to Terabithia

Well well well, so much for why Jesus came to earth and gave His life as ransom for our sin.

Our children have watched this film more than once and it has taught them (and me) something new every time they view it. It becomes an important lesson in living...living each moment and taking nothing for granted. It teaches them about companionship, compassion, loyalty, trust, fairness, equality, the Golden Rule, the importance of parenting, family, dreaming, striving, overcoming obstacles, the cruelty of discrimination and indifference - all critical lessons of becoming fully human and alive. I ask myself why these key qualities of the film would not be good for a child and come up with nothing. One should not wait till he or she is an adult before learning such life lessons. This film is presented in such a way that, with parental care and interaction, introspection and processing feelings can be shared with the utmost care for those who want to view the film.  There is nothing ugly or distasteful about this film. It is an accurate account with respect to the circle of life we will often experience sooner than later.  Children want truth and they become stronger, less cynical and more trusting when it is presented to them with the dignity and respect it deserves.  Films that should be unfavorable for children are those with foul-mouthed language and sexually obscene content. This film respectfully conveys the realities of life that we often wish away until it is too late for the so-called grown up who, in actuality, never really grew up at all!

I wanted the trees to talk back, war with imaginary villains, and fly with the birds. I really felt it and so did the main characters of the story.Josh Hutcherson, who is no stranger to acting already, starring in 15 plus films plays quiet and artistic Jesse Aarons who usually finds himself the [...] of jokes by the loud and obnoxious fellow students at his public school. Hutcherson is terrific and such an amazing lead actor in this film. I think kids will love watching him and really relate to his situation and really respect him and follow him. I hope he continued to get some really great roles. Also really terrific is AnnaSophia Robb who plays unique dreamer Leslie Burke who befriends Jesse and together they have incredible adventures together and form a lasting friendship. AnnaSophia is such a sweetheart and really does bring Leslie to life as this carefree, deep thinking, happy, spirited little girl. She really is the perfect Disney girl and probably has a promising career as such ahead of her. Also terrific is 8 year old Bailee Madison who plays the irrepressible and adorable May Belle Aarons who is really heading towards the same fate that Jesse finds himself in, in the real world. Jesse takes her under his wing and shows her the magic world that him and Leslie have created. Robert Patrick is also just terrific as the Aarons' father, Jesse Sr. Patrick's character is not a bad guy at all!! In fact he is desperately trying to provide for his family, and has simply been worn by the world around him. He wants his children to be raised to be strong providers especially his only son. The supporting cast is also terrific with key performances by Zooey Deschanel, Lauren Clinton, and Cameron Wakefield.The movie bounced back and fourth between the friend's school life and their imaginary world. The two loved each other more than anyone could love and didn't even show it with a kiss. This movie should of been longer. 90 minutes seems to be the typical time for a movie but this one probably needed 15 minutes more. I wanted to see more of their world as it showed just a fair amount in my opinion (kind of like how Pan's Labyrith was - great film by the way).

He is alienated from his mother and father and two of his four sisters. (His two nasty sisters are reminiscent of Cinderella's two caustic step-sisters.) He is close to one little sister. A strange new free soul of a girl, Leslie, comes to school, outraces Jesse, and eventually they become soul mates who discover a fantasy world.The stereotypical schoolyard bullies are in play. Leslie's father is like an empathetic resurrected hippie while Jesse's tough-minded dad takes an awful long time to come around.

Macdonald,"[5, 6]","I experienced (not ""saw"") this movie today with my adult daughter, on a dinner and movie afternoon to ""catch up"" on things; we both share a delight in fantasy that is is interpretive and reflective. Unlike virtually all of the reviewers I've read here, I had no knowledge that a book even existed, let alone was a beloved classic. I saw the movie based on a few intriguing trailers, and never read a review of the movie. We both came to the theatre without expectations based on reviews or the preconception that this was a canon to some, not to be trifled with. It is clear from the reviews here that many viewers were clearly hoping to share something with their children that they had experienced as a child reading the book. Clearly, most of these reviews of the movie judge this movie on it's fidelity in mood, plot, and character to what they individually brought with them from the book they read as a child....and that's OK (for them). I will not discuss the plot, but I cannot understand how someone who read and loved the book would not be aware of the plot and it's central turning point and judge their children's reactions accordingly. I saw no sobbing children...perhaps they were more thoughtful than if it had been ""Shrek"", but as a parent, I would have felt that this film spoke honestly to children about how difficult it is for them to understand their children's world, and how equally tough it is for children to understand the grown up world. I would have expected questions and been prepared with some answers. ""The Bridge to Terabithia"" resonated with me as a much kinder, gentler, and above all honest treatment of the bridge we cross when we move from childhood to adolescence, with it's loss of innocence and come face to face with the world in which we live.Setting aside THE BOOK, I found the MOVIE to be one of the best I've seen this year in it's ability to tap into my feelings about my early years, both as a child and a parent, and I was absorbed from beginning to end by the wonderful, fanciful, magical special effects, as well as the development of the parents from being seen from the children's point of view to a sense of them and their difficulties I understand as an adult. OK, I loved this movie, and I will return with my wife to experience the joy and sadness and wonder of this enchanting film. I loved these characters and I loved the film, and I see many, many films. The innocence and lack of cynicism reminded me of a collaboration of Norman Rockwell and  Steven Spielberg. If you have no young children, see this movie anyway.

It's one of the more memorable films I have seen lately, and one that should be remembered as among the finest films of 2007, or rather, of any recent year. Young Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb (who's probably best known for her cameo performance in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") lead a superb cast that also includes Robert Patrick - in a superb performance that's quite atypical from the roles he's best known for - and Zooey Deschanel in a riveting, delightful, yet also memorable, tale about using a child's superb gifts for imagination, the magical bonds of friendship and love that result between two young outcasts, and the bittersweet lesson which one of them must learn after an accidental tragedy. I was especially moved by Hutcherson's and Patrick's emotionally riveting performances, which almost left me in tears towards the end. I haven't read the original young adult novel of the same title, but I suspect that this fine film is a faithful adaptation, blessed with superb digital effects from WETA, which was also responsible for special effects work on ""The Lord of The Rings"" trilogy and ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"".

Bridge to Terabithia will remain as one of those movies that touched my heart. It is based on a children's novel by Katherine Paterson. The movie stars AnnaSophia Robb from Denver, Colorado and Josh Hutcherson from Union, Kentucky. These two kids' names will be worth remembering.The chemistry between the hero and heroine is amazing. Jesse who Josh plays has solemn look of a loner who are struggling to grow up. Leslie who AnnaSophia plays is vibrant with magnetic personality but lives in her own world as that is  what she learned from her parents. Jesse and Leslie being a neighbor becomes good friend and Leslie leads Jesse into a friendship and her world. Through the relationship Jesse grows up.. rather quickly.I was mesmerized by the vibrance and the beauty of AnnaSophia all through out the movie. She will be a force to deal with in Hollywood. Jesse's ackwardness in growing up portray the puberty the preteens face. It was beautifully acted by Josh.Both characters shine as actors and carries the movie to the end.The movie was directed by Gabor Csupo for Disney/Walden Media and was filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. That is important because those two choices seem to make the movie a bit mysterious, rustic, and brings that touch of fairy tales scenes.

652233,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00005JPL5,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[4, 4]","Fresh from the success of their terrific first installment from the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series, Disney and Walden Media teamed up to deliver BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, marketed as another fantasy film similar to LORD OF THE RINGS and NARNIA.  It even features visual effects by the award-winning New Zealand team behind both of those films.  But don't be misled by the marketing campaign--BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is only partially a fantasy film.  In other words, the ""magical"" elements make up merely about a fraction of its 96 minute running time.What BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA actually is, however, is something quite different.  Based on a highly regarded children's book by Katharine Paterson (the script is co-written by the author's son), the movie is a contemporary family story about a young teenager, Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson), having problems with both his financially restrained family and nasty school bullies.  His sole talent is drawing, but what Jesse really wants is to be the fastest kid in his class, going so far to practice all summer long to the point where he wears out his shoes (he spends a majority of the movie wearing girls' sneakers).Jesse's world is turned upside-down when Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a very pretty and imaginative youngster, steps into his life.  At first, he is resentful about losing to her in a footrace, but before long, the two become close friends.  Every day they set off to a forest where they fabricate an fantasy world called Terabithia; here they can escape from their harsh realities and experience imaginative adventures on their own.  Simultaneously, they strike back at the school bullies, especially when one of them, who guards the girl's bathroom, robs from Jesse's showstealing and adorable little sister, May Belle (Bailee Madison).For the first hour, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is warm, gentle, old-fashioned Disney filmmaking with a touch of nostalgia.  The school scenes brought back memories for some of my early days when I was being picked on at one of the schools I went to.  There is a very amusing contrast between the two different teachers, the stern Mrs. Myers (Jen Wolfe), and the sprightly Miss Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel), whose pretty face and genial nature makes Jesse's heart throb.  It's Jessie and Leslie's friendship, however, that make BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA.  Both are very likeable and appealing, especially Leslie (thanks mainly to a lively and charismatic performance by Robb), and their relationship is genuine and touching without being romantic or sexual.  The scenes between them are lively and a joy to watch, mainly because both children are impeccably cast.  The scenes where they imagine Terabithia is simultaneously thrilling (thanks to the typically spectacular visual effects by Weta Workshop) and a lot of fun.  Meanwhile, little Madison gets many of the best lines and scenes as Jesse's sister, while Robert Patrick turns in a surprising performance as his pressured but ultimately softhearted father.But things take an unexpectedly devastating turn in the final thirty minutes when a horrible tragedy strikes.  I won't reveal what it is (although fans of the book as well as other reviewers on here have already pointed it out), but you might want to consider having a box of Kleenexes during this part of the film.  The finale is not a ""happily ever after"" fairy tale ending, but a semi-sad but hopeful ending.  Not since POCAHONTAS or WILLIE THE OPERATIC WHALE has a Disney production featured a bittersweet ending, but BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA does this in a way that elevates the overall production into something more meaningful than what unsuspecting viewers may expect.Actually, the best way to describe BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is like a mixture of the fantasy and magical elements of NARNIA, LORD OF THE RINGS (although as mentioned, these scenes are only a small part of the film), the close friendship themes from CHARLOTTE'S WEB, as well as a brief sibling misunderstanding reminiscent of Miyazaki's MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO.  I never imagined that such a combination would be possible, but BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA proved me wrong.  It is refreshing to see a movie as deep and meaningful as this, but for a Disney movie it is arguably one of the very best in years.  Considering how mediocre their output has been (although NARNIA and PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN have been happy exceptions), this is saying quite a lot.Don't cross this BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA expecting another roller-coaster/good vs. evil fantasy adventure; when all is said and done, chances are you'll find yourself moved.  There are occasional flashes of special effects, of course, but at heart, it's a beautifully photographed, well directed, compellingly scripted, and strongly acted film that's not just a children's movie.  Even adults are sure to be enchanted.

652238,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,B00005JPL5,Julie Neal,"[4, 4]","Yes -- as many of the earlier reviews here have already given away -- the girl dies. But if you know that going in, watching ""Bridge to Terabithia"" can be a terrific experience. My husband and I sat down with our 13-year-old daughter the other night to watch it and, though we were all crying at the end, it got to us like few other films ever have. This well-grounded movie combines many solid messages about what it's like to be a creative boy, an independent-thinking girl, and, yes, have a loved one suddenly pass away. The girl's death, by the way, is handled with care. The event happens between scenes, so there's no sudden panic, scream or shocking visual. It's actually more affecting that way.The portrayal of the imagined fantasyland of Terabithia does have some good effects, but they are in no way the point of the film and have little to do with its plot. In fact, the movie may have been better without them. The film is helped by the already solid acting chops (and engaging good looks) of young leads Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, as well as those of 8-year-old supporting actress Bailee Madison. They all seem like real kids.As for bonus features, the DVD has two audio commentaries. In the first, the film's main producer, director and writer team up for an interesting, if casual, scene-by-scene analysis. In the second, the young teenage actors spend 90 minutes chatting away like, well, young teenagers. If kids listen to it they'll learn where Disney stuck in a Hidden Hannah Montana. Totally killer!A 15-minute featurette ""Behind the Book"" focuses on the novel instead of the movie, a nice break from Disney's typical self-focused extra. Even a second featurette, the six-minute ""Digital Imagination: Bringing Terabithia to Life,"" starts with an interview with the book's author, Katherine Paterson. There's also a four-minute music video of AnnaSophia Robb singing ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open."" The song's nice and the girl is not a bad singer, but the video is mainly just clips from the film mixed in with shots of the young star standing in front of a microphone.",5,"A moving family film, if your kids can handle death",1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,2096,"['Yes', 'many', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'given', 'away', 'girl', 'know', 'going', 'watching', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'can', 'be', 'terrific', 'experience', 'husband', 'sat', 'down', '13-year-old', 'daughter', 'other', 'night', 'watch', 'were', 'crying', 'end', 'got', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'ever', 'have', 'well-grounded', 'movie', 'combines', 'many', 'solid', 'messages', 'what', 'be', 'creative', 'boy', 'independent-thinking', 'girl', 'yes', 'have', 'loved', 'one', 'suddenly', 'away', 'girl', 'death', 'way', 'handled', 'care', 'event', 'scenes', 'sudden', 'panic', 'scream', 'shocking', 'visual', 'actually', 'more', 'affecting', 'way.The', 'portrayal', 'imagined', 'fantasyland', 'Terabithia', 'have', 'good', 'effects', 'are', 'way', 'point', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'plot', 'fact', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'helped', 'already', 'solid', 'acting', 'chops', 'engaging', 'good', 'looks', 'young', 'leads', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'as', 'well', '8-year-old', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'seem', 'real', 'kids.As', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'first', 'film', 'main', 'producer', 'director', 'writer', 'team', 'up', 'interesting', 'casual', 'scene-by-scene', 'analysis', 'second', 'young', 'teenage', 'actors', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'chatting', 'away', 'well', 'young', 'teenagers', 'kids', 'listen', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'where', 'Disney', 'stuck', 'Hidden', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Totally', 'killer', '15-minute', 'featurette', 'Book', 'novel', 'instead', 'movie', 'nice', 'break', 'Disney', 'typical', 'self-focused', 'extra', 'Even', 'second', 'featurette', 'six-minute', 'Digital', 'Imagination', 'Bringing', 'Terabithia', 'Life', 'interview', 'book', 'author', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'also', 'four-minute', 'music', 'video', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'singing', 'Keep', 'Mind', 'Wide', 'Open', 'song', 'nice', 'girl', 'not', 'bad', 'singer', 'video', 'mainly', 'just', 'clips', 'film', 'mixed', 'shots', 'young', 'star', 'standing', 'front', 'microphone']",Bridge to Terabithia

This movie crackles with life, sizzles with a powerful pro-family message, and delivers it all tied tightly with a clear message of hope, joy, and the bond between one's family members.It's a tear-jerker, don't get me wrong. But a tear-jerker in the same way Old Yeller was many decades ago. It's a story that's true to life and, as everyone knows, in real life people die.Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are outstanding in this film. AnnaSophia, especially, is a stand-out. She practically shines in every scene -- literally. Her blonde hair is aglow and her face is lit up like a beacon.This is a movie with a powerful message: Love, compassion, and family can overcome even the world's worst pain and suffering. Yes, there's a little girl who spouts off slightly askew biblical comments (about not believing the Bible and going to  hell for it -- a concept nowhere found in the Bible) and another girl (AnnaSophia's character) who doubts the statement and offers one of her own. Does that not happen all the time? Do people -- even Christians -- always have answers ready?No way, man. I've been a Christian for some 25 years. I've studied theology, all translations of the Bible, and have attended churches of various denominations. I've discovered Christians do NOT have all the answers -- especially regarded the precise meaning of certain passages of the Bible -- and that many have missed the boat regarding finding joy in life.Bridge to Terabithia is a movie about joy, about celebrating life, and about the power of imagination to lift one out of the valleys and set one on the peaks.Young children are cautioned not to watch this movie, however, The tragic death of someone in it may be too much to take. The death doesn't occur on-screen, but it occurs after everyone falls in love with the character. So please watch responsibly.But do watch. This is a glorious movie that should be in everyone's home, and watched often.I saw a bumper sticker once that simply said, ""The meaning of life is to live it.""So stop arguing and debating the merits of this movie, especially in regard to its Christian/Biblical foundation. It is what it is. And it's a powerful movie for people of all faiths to watch.""The meaning of life is to live it.""

Its not a movie for adults, it is far too juvenile and, well, dumb.I kept waiting for the movie to get to a point - and it never does.  It meanders around in the very sad lives of two different adolescents - both terribly neglected by their parents in very different ways, both bullied, both living pretty sad lives.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, or for the film to reach some pinnacle where it all came together, and it never did.

ALL the characters in the movie are really just characateurs - with no depth or meaning.

652246,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B00005JPL5,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[0, 0]","When you read a book by someone who has a wild imagination, you can only imagine what the person did when he/she was a kid. I am a writer. People tell me I have a great imagination. I don't know if that's true. What I do know is that I grew up in the time period where video games were just starting to go from 2D to 3D, and the internet was being born. While I dabbled in outdoor imagination once in awhile, by the age of seven I was hooked up to electronics and using my imagination to pretend I was on a pirate ship just didn't have much of an effect on me anymore. Besides, pirates stopped being cool until ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" come out to theaters, and made me want to be a pirate again at the ripe age of sixteen, and by that time I found out that boat manufactures stopped making pirate ships due to a lack of interest in them.Since I can not be the only person who has gone through this, and since there are so many other things a kid can plug into these days, I have to wonder whether there would be anyone who could relate to ""Bridge To Terabithia,"" a movie where two kids dodge bullies at school and escape to the imaginary world of Terabithia after school. I feel today's kids have so much more material things to keep them distracted in life then to be bothered with creating magical fantasy worlds in the local creek. I think the film makers realized this was a tricky situation that they couldn't fake, so they made it so our two leads have perfectly logical reasons to not spend all day playing with toys. Our young friend Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) comes from a poor family. They are so poor they can't afford a second hand Game Boy, and he inherits a pair of pink sneakers that belongs to one of his older sisters (he is the middle child between two older sisters and one younger sister).Now his new friend Leslie Burke (Anna Sophia Robb), the girl at school, comes from a rich family. Her parents are both writers, but they do not own a TV because they feel it rots creativeness. I would like to have a word with these parents myself, but for the sake of the movie I'll let them off the hook. Since these two kids have nothing to plug into, and are constantly bullied at school and are unappreciated at home, they must find other means to entertain themselves. They find this entertainment by going deep into the local creek no one visits (probably because the other kids at schools DO have TV's and computer games to play), and create an imaginary world that they call Terabithia. They build a fort, play games, and in one scene even fight trolls and flying monsters. A good majority of the movie takes place at home and in school though, where they have very real problems to deal with.Jesse has great talent to be an artist, but receives little support from his family. His stressed out father in particular doesn't support his love for art, saying ""if [drawing is] so beneficial why don't you draw me some money?"" He receives encouragement to continue his drawing from Ms. Edmonds, the music teacher he develops a crush on. Leslie's problems at home are minor, but we find out that she has never had any friends on account that people are intimidated by her imaginative personality. Both kids are bullied by kids, though Leslie deals with the bullying better then Jessie does (a girl who tries to charge a dollar to use the bathroom inspires Leslie to start a ""Free The Pee"" march). In Terabithia though, these kids are King and Queen, protecting their kingdom and escaping their problems. A twist near the end changes their lives though.I will not share this twist with you, but it elevates the movie from ""heartwarming kids tale"" to a full blown tragedy. For those who have read the book I'm sure you know what to expect. I did not, and therefor the twist came as a punch in the stomach to me. It left me so devastated I cried twice. Once in the theater and once when I got home. I'm not going to comment much on the advertising campaign, other then to say that I think it's a shame Disney feels like they need to pretend this is a children's ""Lord of the Rings"" in order to sell tickets. This is a great movie, period. The smoke and mirrors are not needed to sell this to kids. Kids love movies based on whether they are good or not, and promising them something they are not going to get doesn't help your bottom line in the long run.And this movie is full of things kids love.  Adventures, jokes, underdogs that come out on top.  Heck, it even has a regular dog in the movie.  I don't care who you are, but having a dog included in a movie automatically makes me add half a star to a movie based on that fact alone.  For adults it will bring back a childhood innocense they thought they had lost.  For me it was a revolution of the heart.  Aside from the fact that I was expecting a completely different movie then what I got, it brought back memories of when you felt the world was against you, and it was only you and your best friend who could take care of each other.  Still, the movie geek in me has to admit that the biggest revelation from this movie comes from the fact that it was directed by Gabor Csupo, who is most famous as the creator of ""The Rugrats.""It's such a big shock to find that out, that I wonder if the feeling people had when they discovered Frank Sinatra was a pretty good actor was similar to this. Csupo creates a wonderful movie here for people of any age. I think parents with kids under the age of ten might want to preview the movie first, because the movie really does become depressing, but otherwise this is a great movie. I hesitate before saying this, because it's only February, but...oh, what the heck I'll say it anyway. ""Bridge To Terabithia"" is one of the best films of the year.Rating: **** and a half stars",4,"Heartwarming and Tragic, A Real Surprise",1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,5814,"['When', 'read', 'book',

652247,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JPL5,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[79, 87]","I know absolutely nothing about the young adult novel that this film, ""Bridge to Terabithia,"" is based on.  For this reason, I will only review this film for its contents and not on how well it translates the book to the screen.  With that said, I can claim that ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is just one more wonderful film that's been produced as of late for youngsters that's based on a book or book series.  Produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures, this film tells the story of Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson of ""Zathura""), a boy who lives in poverty but escapes from reality through drawing fantastical creatures and worlds.  When a new neighbor moves in who marches to the beat of a different drum, the two of them combine their imaginations to create the kingdom of Terabithia.  The neighbor is Leslie Burke, and she's played by the likeable and enthusiastic AnnaSophia Robb (""Because of Winn-Dixie,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"").  She and Jesse take their personal miseries from school and at home and turn them into trolls, evil squirrels, grenade-like pinecones and a whole slew of other creatures.  All of the bad people of Terabithia are lead by the Dark Master, a smoky, phantom-like creature.As the story unfolds, Jesse and Leslie form a strong friendship both in reality and in fantasy.  When Jesse is asked to go to the museum by his music teacher (the excellent Zooey Deschanel), he intentionally leaves Leslie behind.  Why?  Because like any most boys in middle school he happens to have a crush on his music teacher (It's Zooey Deschanel, who wouldn't?).  When a tragedy occurs, Jesse's worlds, real and fantasy, experience dramatic changes.""Bridge to Terabithia"" is essentially a coming-of-age tale where kids who aren't quite children but haven't yet reached adulthood come to feel the consequences of reality.  Jesse and Leslie love their fantasy world, but each day brings more reality with it.  The cast is headed up by Hutcherson, Robb, and young Bailee Madison (Jesse's cute little sister, May Belle).  The supporting cast includes Deschanel, the always reliably gruff Robert Patrick (""Terminator 2"") and Lauren Clinton.  While the adults play key roles in this film, it's really all about the kids.The special effects are very good, though most pre-teens will pick up on their limitations.  However, the special effects take a backseat to the story, which is always refreshing to see these days.Parents with younger children should know that the tragedy aforemetioned may be very tough for youngsters to take.  I won't go into details, but just know that it's one of the gravest tragedies that can occur in anyone's life.  There are also two instances of strong language.  The ""d"" word is used repetively in both of them.  One occurs in the back of a truck after church and the other happens in the greenhouse at Jesse's home when he loses his father's keys.  Other than that, there isn't anything in the film that you really need to look out for.As a fantasy tale, ""Terabithia"" works well.  It works better as a film about a young boy and his friend who come to terms with reality.  I highly recommend this film for families, just be prepared to do some heavy explaining with younger children (under eight) when reality really, really hits home.  Fans of this movie may also enjoy ""The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,"" the ""Harry Potter"" films (although as Harry gets older, the movies and books become geared more towards older children), and ""The Neverending Story.""  Also, even though I haven't read this particular book, I have read plenty of other young adult books in my day.  Pick up ""A Wrinkle In Time"" by Madeleine L'Engle, any of the ""Harry Potter"" books, or any other wonderful child and pre-teen fantasy for your children to read if they enjoy this film.Highly recommended.",4,Crossing The Bridge Between Fantasy And Reality,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,3853,"['know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'young', 'adult', 'novel', 'film', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'based', 'reason', 'will', 'only', 'review', 'film', 'contents', 'not', 'how', 'well', 'book', 'screen', 'said', 'can', 'claim', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'wonderful', 'film', 'been', 'produced', 'late', 'youngsters', 'based', 'book', 'book', 'series', 'Produced', 'Walden', 'Media', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures', 'film', 'story', 'Jesse', 'Aarons', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Zathura', 'boy', 'who', 'poverty', 'escapes', 'reality', 'drawing', 'fantastical', 'creatures', 'worlds', 'When', 'new', 'neighbor', 'moves', 'who', 'marches', 'beat', 'different', 'drum', 'two', 'combine', 'imaginations', 'create', 'kingdom', 'Terabithia', 'neighbor', 'Leslie', 'Burke', 'played', 'likeable', 'enthusiastic', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Winn-Dixie', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Jesse', 'take', 'personal', 'miseries', 'school', 'home', 'turn', 'trolls', 'evil', 'squirrels', 'grenade-like', 'pinecones', 'whole', 'slew', 'other', 'creatures', 'bad', 'people', 'Terabithia', 'are', 'lead', 'Dark', 'Master', 'smoky', 'phantom-like', 'creature.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'form', 'strong', 'friendship', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'When', 'Jesse', 'asked', 'go', 'museum', 'music', 'teacher', 'excellent', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'intentionally', 'Leslie', 'behind', 'Why', 'most', 'boys', 'middle', 'school', 'have', 'crush', 'music', 'teacher', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'When', 'tragedy', 'Jesse', 'worlds', 'real', 'fantasy', 'experience', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'essentially', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'where', 'kids', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'children', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'reached', 'adulthood', 'come', 'feel', 'consequences', 'reality', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'love', 'fantasy', 'world', 'day', 'more', 'reality', 'cast', 'headed', 'up', 'Hutcherson', 'Robb', 'young', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'Jesse', 'cute', 'little', 'sister', 'May', 'Belle', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Deschanel', 'always', 'reliably', 'gruff', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Terminator', '2', 'Lauren', 'Clinton', 'adults', 'play', 'key', 'roles', 'film', 'really', 'kids.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'pre-teens', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'limitations', 'However', 'special', 'effects', 'take', 'backseat', 'story', 'always', 'refreshing', 'see', 'days.Parents', 'younger', 'children', 'should', 'know', 'tragedy', 'aforemetioned', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'tough', 'youngsters', 'take', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'just', 'know', 'one', 'gravest', 'tragedies', 'can', 'occur', 'anyone', 'life', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'instances', 'strong', 'language', 'd', 'word', 'used', 'repetively', 'One', 'back', 'truck', 'church', 'other', 'happens', 'greenhouse', 'Jesse', 'home', 'when', 'father', 'keys', 'Other', ""n't"", 'anything', 'film', 'really', 'need', 'look', 'out', 'for.As', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'Terabithia', 'well', 'better', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'friend', 'who', 'come', 'terms', 'reality', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'families', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'do', 'heavy', 'explaining', 'younger', 'children', 'eight', 'when', 'reality', 'really', 'really', 'home', 'Fans', 'movie', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'Harry', 'older', 'movies', 'books', 'become', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'older', 'children', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'Also', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'particular', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'plenty', 'other', 'young', 'adult', 'books', 'day', 'Pick', 'up', 'Wrinkle', 'Time', 'Madeleine', ""L'Engle"", 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'other', 'wonderful', 'child', 'pre-teen', 'fantasy', 'children', 'read', 'enjoy', 'film.Highly', 'recommended']",Bridge to Terabithia

The two become friends and use their imagination to turn a secret spot in the woods into a beautiful kingdom.  In ""Terabithia,"" they rule over the strange but good creatures and battle the Dark Lord.  Everything is great, until one day when Jess doesn't come to play.This movie could have, and should have been wonderful, with flights of fancy that made me say, ""WOW!"" and touching moments that left me teary.  Unfortunately, it missed the mark.  The fantasy land the children created wasn't that big of a deal; we only saw fleeting glimpses of it and never had time to be awed by its wonder and wish it were real.  The two young leads, Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, were competent, but not special.  Neither of them had the charisma to own the screen and make me care about them.  Of course, the big culprit was the script, which tried to include too much, ending up with not enough.  We get Jess' poverty, artistic talent, and loneliness, Leslie's quirkiness and pluck, the bullies at school, his crush on his teacher, and the often-annoying cute younger sister, complete with precious lisp; with all this, there wasn't time to make Terabithia seem real or as fantastic as it should have been.  The scene that should have elicited tears was abrupt and completely lacking in drama and power.  So, it's an OK movie if you're stuck watching it on a plane, but not a flick to buy, unless your kids are fans of the book.  2.5 stars.",3,Tepid tale of childhood friends,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,1567,"['Ten-year', 'old', 'Jess', 'bullied', 'school', 'ignored', 'home', 'new', 'girl', 'Leslie', 'who', 'also', 'looked', 'weirdo', 'outsider', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'use', 'imagination', 'turn', 'secret', 'spot', 'woods', 'beautiful', 'kingdom', 'Terabithia', 'rule', 'strange', 'good', 'creatures', 'battle', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Everything', 'great', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'Jess', ""n't"", 'come', 'play.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'flights', 'fancy', 'made', 'say', 'WOW', 'touching', 'moments', 'left', 'teary', 'Unfortunately', 'missed', 'mark', 'fantasy', 'land', 'children', 'created', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'only', 'saw', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'never', 'had', 'time', 'be', 'awed', 'wonder', 'wish', 'were', 'real', 'two', 'young', 'leads', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'were', 'competent', 'not', 'special', 'had', 'charisma', 'own', 'screen', 'make', 'care', 'course', 'big', 'culprit', 'was', 'script', 'tried', 'include', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'up', 'not', 'enough', 'get', 'Jess', 'poverty', 'artistic', 'talent', 'loneliness', 'Leslie', 'quirkiness', 'pluck', 'bullies', 'school', 'crush', 'teacher', 'often-annoying', 'cute', 'younger', 'sister', 'complete', 'precious', 'lisp', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'make', 'Terabithia', 'seem', 'real', 'as', 'fantastic', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'elicited', 'tears', 'was', 'abrupt', 'completely', 'lacking', 'drama', 'power', 'So', 'OK', 'movie', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'watching', 'plane', 'not', 'flick', 'buy', 'kids', 'are', 'fans', 'book', '2.5', 'stars']",Bridge to Terabithia

But if I have had the wrong idea about the story for the past several decades the trailers that were put out for this film version only served to supplant my original erronous idea with a different ones.  The trailers made me think that I was going to watch something akin to ""The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" but of course now that I have seen this 2007 film the obvious point of reference is ""Pan's Labyrinth"".  Obviously I am not the only one to notice the quantum gap between what we saw in the trailer and what we got in the film, but I have seen my fair share of stupid ad campaigns for pretty good movies and in the final analysis that is what this film is, so forget the stupid trailers.""Bridge to Terabithia"" is not a special effects movie but a movie about a special friendship.  Jesse Arons (Josh Hutcherson, ""Zathura"") is taunted, teased, and bullied at school and takes refuge in his drawing, but his family is oblivious to his artistic talents.  Then Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb, ""Because of Winn-Dixie"") walks into his life as the new girl in class.  As extroverted as Jess is introverted, Leslie turns out to be a kindred spirit whose talent is for writing.  At first Jess treats her as horribly as everybody else as the new girl assumes the spot at the bottom of the school's pecking order.  But they have too much in common and they become friends, doing everything together, including exploring the woods and finding the special place she named Terabithia where parents and chores, bullies and kid sisters, can be left behind.There is no need to say more because you deserve to discover how this one plays out for yourself.  The cast features Robert Patrick as Jesse's overworked father and Zooey Deschanel as the kid's music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, but this film favors the kids over the adults while making it clear they live in the real world, even with the wonders of Terabithia.  I especially like the way the plotline regarding the schoolyard bully, Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton), plays out, even more than what Josh and Leslie come up with for Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless) and Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) in Terabithia.  My understanding is that the screenplay by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell is quite faithful to the book, although obviously those who have read it would know far better than me.

Slowly, Leslie's imagination rubs off on Jesse, and he begins to enjoy these games as well.  Their friendship even helps them deal with the bullies they face at school.  But will it help when tragedy strikes?This movie is based on a classic children's novel.  Those familiar with the book need not worry, this movie sticks closely to the book.  For those not familiar with the book, that means pay no attention to the ads you may have seen because this is not a fantasy movie.  The majority of the movie is spent in the realities of fifth grade life.And it has a very bitter sweet ending.  If you are looking for a light film, you will be disappointed.  But it is well worth enduring the sorrow for the beauty of the ending.The original novel was written and set in the 1970's but the movie is given a modern setting.  It only affects little things, and the heart of the story remains unchanged.The acting is top notch, too.  AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both newcomers and are perfectly believable as the leads.  The other stand out is Bailee Madison as Jesse's younger sister.My only complaint comes from comparing the movie to the book, a situation in which the movie almost always loses.  I read the book for the first time last month, and was deeply moved by it.  The characters were rich and there was lots of depth to the story.  Naturally, that can't be achieved in a movie.  If the book wasn't so fresh in my mind, I would have enjoyed this version more.  This is a minor complaint, however, since I was as deeply moved by the ending of the movie as I was the book.Don't watch this expecting a light fantasy story.  But by all means do watch it.  You'll be moved by this story of the power that friendship can have on a life.",5,"Bits of Fantasy, but More of a Drama",1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,2362,"['Jesse', 'Aarons', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'middle', 'five', 'kids', 'only', 'boy', 'family', 'poor', 'farm', 'country', 'fact', ""'re"", 'so', 'poor', 'wear', 'older', 'sister', 'shoes', 'first', 'day', 'fifth', 'grade.It', 'also', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'when', 'Leslie', 'Burke', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'new', 'neighbor', 'When', 'Jesse', 'races', 'recess', 'less', 'then', 'happy', 'slowly', 'two', 'build', 'friendship.It', 'Leslie', 'idea', 'create', 'magical', 'kingdom', 'Terabithia', 'anything', 'can', 'imagine', 'are', 'rulers', 'must', 'fight', 'evil', 'creatures', 'realm', 'Slowly', 'Leslie', 'imagination', 'rubs', 'off', 'Jesse', 'enjoy', 'games', 'as', 'well', 'friendship', 'even', 'deal', 'bullies', 'face', 'school', 'will', 'help', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'movie', 'based', 'classic', 'children', 'novel', 'familiar', 'book', 'need', 'not', 'worry', 'movie', 'closely', 'book', 'not', 'familiar', 'book', 'pay', 'attention', 'ads', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'majority', 'movie', 'spent', 'realities', 'fifth', 'grade', 'life.And', 'very', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'ending', 'are', 'looking', 'light', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'well', 'worth', 'enduring', 'sorrow', 'beauty', 'ending.The', 'original', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'set', '1970', 'movie', 'given', 'modern', 'setting', 'only', 'little', 'things', 'heart', 'story', 'unchanged.The', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'too', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'are', 'newcomers', 'are', 'perfectly', 'believable', 'leads', 'other', 'stand', 'out', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'Jesse', 'younger', 'sister.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'comparing', 'movie', 'book', 'situation', 'movie', 'almost', 'always', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'month', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'characters', 'were', 'rich', 'was', 'lots', 'depth', 'story', 'Naturally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'achieved', 'movie', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'fresh', 'mind', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'more', 'minor', 'complaint', 'however', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'book.Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'expecting', 'light', 'fantasy', 'story', 'means', 'do', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'moved', 'story', 'power', 'friendship', 'can', 'have', 'life']",Bridge to Terabithia
652266,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00005JPL5,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 5]","As a movie about the lost powers of the imagination, ""Terabithia"" is a mixed blessing.  Kids today have a lot of digital and electronic crutches on which to prop up their creative spirit; it's nice for a story to encourage the limitless scope of the human mind.  Fifteen year old Jesse Aarons, an aspiring artist, has a home life that offers little in the way of dream nourishment, so it is no surprise when he quickly befriends the New Girl In School, Leslie Burke, a young naif with a spirit as wholesome and wide-eyed as her cute little face.Jesse and Leslie soon discover their own little paradise in the woods behind their house.  They call this land Terabithia and dress it up with their ""wide open"" minds.  Disney helps the jaded viewer out by giving us sometimes rich, sometimes ambivalent CGI depictions of their pretend world, but they are rare.  This is just as well; the movie wants us to rediscover the wonder of our own minds, but it leaves very little of the story up to our own imaginations.I have to wonder if the emotion of the film (and it wants to have so much emotion) wouldn't have more impact if there was more humanity to back it up.  It shows us a world of heartless bullies (some misunderstood and hurting; some just plain malicious), pesky but endearing little sisters, and happy vs. struggling homes, and then balances this out with brief moments of care-free, play-land giddiness.  It can't have both, at least not in equal measure.  It sacrifices some of its heart and soul for the kindling flash of its fantasy world, and vice versa.By the time Jesse's absurdly hot music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, offers (out of the blue!) to take him (alone!) to a museum, it's hard to figure out just what is real and what isn't (this movie's world must exist before things like permission slips were invented).  At any rate, this becomes the marker for the movie's last bit of credibility, where Jesse and Leslie's world runs headlong into harsh reality.  What follows are a series of events that pretend to be saturated with import, but which are instead progressively longer and more maudlin.  By the time all was said and done, this reviewer felt cheated.  The flick pretended to be magical, but I could see the rabbits hiding in its hat.",3,Reality Check,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,2255,"['movie', 'lost', 'powers', 'imagination', 'Terabithia', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'Kids', 'today', 'have', 'lot', 'digital', 'electronic', 'crutches', 'prop', 'up', 'creative', 'spirit', 'nice', 'story', 'encourage', 'limitless', 'scope', 'human', 'mind', 'Fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'Jesse', 'Aarons', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'home', 'life', 'little', 'way', 'dream', 'nourishment', 'surprise', 'when', 'quickly', 'New', 'Girl', 'School', 'Leslie', 'Burke', 'young', 'naif', 'spirit', 'wholesome', 'wide-eyed', 'cute', 'little', 'face.Jesse', 'Leslie', 'soon', 'discover', 'own', 'little', 'paradise', 'woods', 'house', 'call', 'land', 'Terabithia', 'dress', 'wide', 'open', 'minds', 'Disney', 'jaded', 'viewer', 'giving', 'sometimes', 'rich', 'sometimes', 'ambivalent', 'CGI', 'depictions', 'pretend', 'world', 'are', 'rare', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'rediscover', 'wonder', 'own', 'minds', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'up', 'own', 'imaginations.I', 'have', 'wonder', 'emotion', 'film', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'impact', 'was', 'more', 'humanity', 'back', 'up', 'world', 'heartless', 'bullies', 'misunderstood', 'hurting', 'just', 'plain', 'malicious', 'pesky', 'endearing', 'little', 'sisters', 'happy', 'vs.', 'struggling', 'homes', 'then', 'balances', 'out', 'brief', 'moments', 'care-free', 'play-land', 'giddiness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'least', 'not', 'equal', 'measure', 'heart', 'soul', 'kindling', 'flash', 'fantasy', 'world', 'vice', 'time', 'Jesse', 'absurdly', 'hot', 'music', 'teacher', 'Ms.', 'Edmonds', 'offers', 'blue', 'take', 'alone', 'museum', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'real', 'what', ""n't"", 'movie', 'world', 'must', 'exist', 'things', 'permission', 'slips', 'were', 'invented', 'rate', 'marker', 'movie', 'last', 'bit', 'credibility', 'where', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'world', 'headlong', 'harsh', 'reality', 'What', 'are', 'series', 'events', 'pretend', 'be', 'saturated', 'import', 'are', 'instead', 'progressively', 'longer', 'more', 'maudlin', 'time', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'reviewer', 'felt', 'cheated', 'flick', 'pretended', 'be', 'magical', 'could', 'see', 'rabbits', 'hiding', 'hat']",Bridge to Terabithia

Not a fantasy movieYes, the marketing was... made... did... huh? Ok, point taken. The previews were all focused completely on the ""fantasy world"" CGI. Bad decision.2. Not for kidsEhhh... what? People don't want to ""expose"" kids to the somethomes harsh realities of life? People die. Children die. The way to deal with it is to talk about it, not to shelter kids from it, so they can *really* break down when they're older and have never had any experience with death...Ok, now, the review:I've never read the book (in all honesty, the title made me believe this was a very new story dreamt up by the minds of the Disney Fungineers), but the book (as well as the movie) are both on my wishlist, now. I did expect a Narnia-type story, but the lack of special effects made the movie that much more touching. I don't have to repeat the synopsis (it's right up there on the product page), but what this movie did was touch me and my wife deeply and profoundly, and it ranks right up there with ""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Tideland"" and ""Running with scissors"" - all movies that deal with children who are subject to tragedy, in bigger or lesser degrees.The acting is solid (and in this Drake and Josh Hannah Montana age where children on TV and in movies are either obnoxious wise*** brats or way too sweet and smart for their age, AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson put down a performance that is truly inspiring and awesome in the true meaning of the word; they should be considered an example for young actors everywhere), the adults aren't simply caricatures, and the backstory of the children (both the heroes and the bullies) is, if maybe somewhat exaggeratedly clich&eacute;, believable.Bridge To Terabithia may not be a fantasy movie, but it is a heartwarming story of friendship, and an inspiring and straight-forward way to introduce the concept of death and loss to the younger ones among us.Is it a long movie? Sure, it's quite a bit to chew through, but does even death have to be cut down to MTV length? At slightly more than an hour and a half, this movie proved, for my wife and I, anyway, a great discussion topic. I'm man enough to admit that I cried all through the last 15 or 20 minutes. Not knowing the story, I never saw the tragedy coming, and it - well, let's keep this reader-friendly - it felt like I had the air punched out of me.I've seen a lot of movies, and feel I have become hardened against all the weepy strings and violins that are supposed to get people's emotions going. A movie that sidetracks me like this... wow. The movie got me thinking about my own life, the chances I took and the opportunities I missed... it isn't too often that a movie (a DISNEY movie, even!) can awaken such thoughts and emotions in me.I have to tip my hat at the director and the actors for keeping me glued to the screen until after the last of the end titles had faded away.

A classic story of a young boy's coming of age, the casual cruelty of children, the power of imagination, the magic of friendship, the effect of sudden and unexpect loss, ""Bridge To Terabithia"" is visually spectacular, deeply engaging, profoundly thoughtful, and wholesomely entertaining. Especially recommended for young viewers in grades 5 through 8, ""Bridge To Terabithia"" is a film that can be viewed with great interest to teens and adults as well. This 95-minute film's DVD format also for the inclusion of several special bonus features including a downloadable classroom edition teacher's guide for discussing various elements of the movie; 'Digital Imagaijnton: Bringing Terabithia To Life""; ""Behind The Book: Themes of PBridge To Tereabitha""; audio commentary with directory Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer hal Lieberman; as well as audio commentary with actors Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, and producer Loaruen Levine. With flawless production values, a very strong supporting cast, and simply spectacular special effects, ""Bridge To Terabithia"" is a valued and enthusiastically recommended addition to family, school, and community library DVD collections for children.",5,A valued and enthusiastically recommended addition,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,1494,"['Simply', 'stated', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'finest', 'live', 'action', 'combined', 'CGI', 'animation', 'ever', 'come', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'Co-produced', 'Walden', 'Media', 'Disney', 'movie', 'based', 'popular', 'Newbery', 'Medal', 'award-winning', 'children', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'A', 'classic', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'coming', 'age', 'casual', 'cruelty', 'children', 'power', 'imagination', 'magic', 'friendship', 'effect', 'sudden', 'unexpect', 'loss', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'deeply', 'engaging', 'profoundly', 'thoughtful', 'wholesomely', 'entertaining', 'Especially', 'recommended', 'young', 'viewers', 'grades', '5', '8', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'great', 'interest', 'teens', 'adults', 'as', 'well', '95-minute', 'film', 'DVD', 'format', 'also', 'inclusion', 'several', 'special', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'downloadable', 'classroom', 'edition', 'teacher', 'guide', 'discussing', 'various', 'elements', 'movie', ""'Digital"", 'Imagaijnton', 'Bringing', 'Terabithia', 'Life', 'Book', 'Themes', 'PBridge', 'Tereabitha', 'audio', 'commentary', 'directory', 'Gabor', 'Csupo', 'writer', 'Jeff', 'Stockwell', 'producer', 'hal', 'Lieberman', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'commentary', 'actors', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'producer', 'Loaruen', 'Levine', 'flawless', 'production', 'values', 'very', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'simply', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'valued', 'enthusiastically', 'recommended', 'addition', 'family', 'school', 'community', 'library', 'DVD', 'collections', 'children']",Bridge to Terabithia

They do a good job with their roles, but I admit I feel a bit misled about this movie.  I was under the impression that their magical world was more tangible and not just a figment of their imaginations.  There is not as much exploration into the fantasy world as I would have liked, and the story moves along a bit slow in places.  That said, it still is a pretty good movie with a couple of life lessons thrown in.  Disney films always make some kind of point.  The moral of the story may be ""live life to the fullest, consider others even if they themselves seem inconsiderate, and don't underestimate the power of a good imagination.""  I feel a bit bad for the children who starred in this movie because even though they really did a good job with their roles, the storyline was weak and there weren't many significant peaks to make it impactful or connect you strongly to the story.

652279,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B00005JPL5,MollyRK,"[2, 2]","I have been wanting to write a review for this film since I saw it for the first time, back in February. Though the main praises and controversies surrounding the story have been well covered by previous reviews on this site, this movie holds a personal significance that prompts me to share my own thoughts--although I must admit, I wasn't quite sure what to say about it.I am a huge movie fan and have seen a generous number of them over the years, and for some reason, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is--in all genuine honesty--the very best, most beautiful, most heartwrenching work of art I have ever seen. Even if it might sound silly to regard a Disney film as something that profound and meaningful, it is certainly true that this particular movie had more time, effort, and sensitivity put into it than most others from the infamous Walt Disney empire.After watching this movie a good 13 or 14 times (the sad thing is, I'm not even joking), it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why it has moved me in a way that no other film has. Yes, it has a powerful message, a well-executed emotional undercurrent, and some truly impressive acting, but I have seen other movies with similar qualities. I don't even remember being a HUGE fan of the accompanying book by Katherine Paterson, although my fourth grade teacher did read it to our class twelve years ago, and what I remember of it is the strong development of unique, positive characters who--at the tender age of 11 or so--receive a thing or two to think about concerning the ""realities of life,"" as several of us would call them.Countless children's books have been adapted for the big screen over the years, among them including ""Because of Winn-Dixie,"" ""Madeline,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" and ""Shiloh."" When you are transferring stories like these to film, it is so crucial to do it the right way, and sometimes, the end result doesn't really do much justice to the original author. One of the reasons I enjoyed ""Bridge to Terabithia"" so much is because it did not feel the need to conform the movie script to the things that today's society often deems as important, such domineering special effects and technology-driven means of having fun. This film allowed the main characters to highlight some of the personal creativity that all of us can take a lesson from, without making it too saccharine or unrealistic.I don't really want to hash over too much of the actual plot, since I was a little late in writing my review and, as a result, have a slew of reviews before mine that provide those details. However, since the acting in this film was so powerful and memorable, I would like to comment a bit on that. There are very few actors who command a role so well that you cannot imagine another person as that character, but Josh Hutcherson was about as incredible in this movie as anyone could have possibly been. I saw him for the first time in ""Little Manhattan"" and thought he was a cute kid with a fresh face in the booming child star industry, but he has since metamorphosized into this amazing, amazing young actor. Simply put, he just seems to know what he is doing when he gets in front of the camera, and let me tell you, that can't be taught (and in fact, Hutcherson did not take any acting classes when he started out at the age of 9, and his career launched because he was basically a talented kid with a gift for portraying different characters). I've heard about actors who can indicate so much emotion with just their eyes and facial expressions, but Hutcherson absolutely has it down cold. I give him a lot of props for what he did with his character, and I predict he is going to do extremely well in his career (which should easily extend into adulthood, for a 14-year-old with this much natural talent).As for the critical role of Leslie Burke, it has been said that child star sensation Dakota Fanning was allegedly offered the role first. I admit that I can envision her as the character (though many of you might disagree), but I also feel that the casting director's final choice was for the best, given the remarkable performance by AnnaSophia Robb. Always capable of delivering a strong acting job, Robb used her trademark charisma, beautiful smile, and ever-sparkling eyes to lend all the right elements to this dynamic character. Watching Leslie's strengths and personalities unfold in the plot, she reminded me so much of a friend I had back in grammar school, who was constantly making up stories and thriving in a rambling imagination that did not require a television set, an I-pod, or just hanging around indoors. You know the actors are doing their craft well when you can compare their characters with figures from real life, and for that, both Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are outstanding up-and-coming stars for being so young. (The obvious close friendship that they have off-screen is also clearly a contributing factor to what they created with Jess and Leslie in the movie.)Also noteworthy in the cast is young Bailee Madison, whose performance as Jess's younger sister May Belle is about as refreshing as you could ask for in a movie. To see what I mean, just take a second to think about all the 5-year-old children you have seen in the movies over the years, and then ask yourself how many of them actually act like real kids? With her sweet, boisterous, pesky yet affectionate personality throughout the film, Bailee paints a nearly flawless image of any child her age that I would see in my own life, and I give her a lot of credit for that. In some cases, it's far better for a kid to just be herself in a movie, rather than acting too mature and ten years older than she really is, and that is what brings a sense of magic to Bailee's performance (not to mention the fact that you will be hard-pressed to find at least one scene of hers that doesn't make you well up, especially in the film's last thirty minutes). Zooey Deschanel, also, brings magic to the movie as the hip young music teacher, whose upbeat personality and genuine passion for her job reflects what is best about today's elementary educators.Although the climax in ""Bridge to Terabithia"" packs a punch and will leave older audiences with a question or two to answer for the younger viewers, the culminating themes presented are anything but dark and depressing, as some other reviewers here have indicated. Since when is it not completely uplifting to watch kids overcome emotional hardship, recognize the impact of the friends around them, and use what they have learned to make efforts that they may not have considered before. I don't believe for a minute that Jess would have made the decision he did at the end of the film if it weren't for the ""close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open"" ideal that Leslie introduced to him in their friendship.And so it goes. Many people have criticized the phenomenon of false advertisement and the unsettling plot threads that changed the film's originally perceived direction in a matter of seconds. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and their differing feelings about the movie are valid, but it's the idea of this being an inappropriate children's film that makes me want to ask the question: What exactly do we want to be teaching our kids, if not courage and compassion in the face of adversity? If we don't want them exposed to certain things, and if we want to protect them from what might be potentially sad or painful, then what opportunity is there to help them learn some of the life lessons that Jess Aarons did at the conclusion of the story? Yes, I understand that it's just a movie, and no kid is going to have a fully developed concept of reality simply by watching ""Bridge to Terabithia."" However, before we claim that the chosen themes are too much for children and should be replaced with something more along the lines of ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" we should consider what Katherine Paterson and the filmmakers are trying to communicate with a story like this. Trust me, the message is intended to be a positive one, achieved by working through the tough stuff and discovering a level of happiness that is different, but every bit as valuable.This isn't to say that I would recommend showing this movie to a preschooler and eagerly filling her plate with all these ideas, but for a kid around the age of 9 or so, it is very much a ""children's film"" that can be enjoyed by the whole family and appreciated for occasionally uneasy but always important messages it shares. In addition, I am not trying to speak negatively of action ""Narnia"" type films for kids. Those are also good films with positive qualities of their own, and if that's what you like, then there is absolutely no problem with it. For the purpose of this particular movie, however, and what it is trying to say to contemporary audiences, I am just saying that it deserves a shot, and if you are looking for a film with kids who are good role models and creative ways of thinking that are encouraged, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is worth your time. If you watched it and didn't like it, or if you were upset by the marketing choices that the studio made with the preview trailers, then hey, what's the worst that can happen? You spent some money on a movie theater ticket, a video rental, or maybe even a DVD purchase that you weren't completely satisfied with--or maybe you watched it with your kids because you were expecting something else, and you had to have a conversation afterward that you weren't exactly thrilled about. Even then, though, in a situation like that, there are far more positive things than negative to derive from the film's ending.With that in mind, I would like to give this film my strongest recommendation. Setting the plot aside, the DVD does have a nice set of special features, including a commentary by Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb--as well as one of the film producers Lauren Levine--that is both sweet and interesting to listen to, especially if you are a fan of these two stars. It is obvious that they are good friends off camera, which explains why their relationship was so convincing in the film. There is another commentary by the director, writer and producer; a short featurette about the special effects; and a second featurette where the cast teams up with educators and elementary school administrators all over the country to discuss the book's themes and provide valid reasons to introduce it in classroom curriculums. Lastly, there is a music video for the song ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open,"" performed by AnnaSophia Robb and sprinkled with some scenes from the movie. Although her actress-turned-singer approach is similar to what young movie starlets like Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan have done in their careers, AnnaSophia is a beautiful girl who, to her credit, appeared to give it her all with this song. Regardless of anything else, it is a nice tune, with lyrics that correlates perfectly with everything that this movie is about.I am writing this because this film has reached me in a way that NO other movie has, and there is just something about it that makes me literally want to watch it over and over (which I have essentially been doing ever since I purchased the DVD). If you have not seen it, or if you are debating whether or not it is the right material for young ones, I really hope that you will at least rent it and give it a chance. Just because it is the best movie I have ever seen does not mean that I expect everyone else to agree, but if nothing else, it is a film with an impeccably chosen cast--a group of actors who obviously grasp the movie's purpose and play it out so effortlessly. When she wrote the book in the 1970's, Katherine Paterson wasn't sure if children could deal with the emotions of the story, but her editor knew that kids could, and she was right on target. Paterson did base the plot on a difficult experience that she encountered with her 8-year-old son many years ago, and after all, what hits home harder than a story that is true?",5,"Intense human

It's comparable to The Neverending Story andExplorers, a couple of my favorites from the '80s, and in my opinion it's even better than Chronicles of Narnia, though I don't expect many Narnia fans to agree. This one doesn't have too much fantasy, just a few sequences from the imagination of the two child protagonists. But the story around that is profoundly moving with useful lessons for the whole family, including a practical demonstration of a Teddy Roosevelt quotation: ""Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing,"" - and much more.I've seen over 4,000 movies, includig at least 3 or 4 new ones a month, and this is my favorite in years, certainly the best in the past six months (my favorite last year was The Prestige), and I like it more than Harry Potter, because it's more serious.

But what's sadder is that so many supposedly adult viewers can so thoroughly miss the point of any movie with a message more complicated than ""bang,"" or think children can and should be shielded from the knowledge of death by censoring it from all fiction.  Think of how many wonderful books or movies would be spoiled -A Dog of Flanders,My Girl,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,The Courtship of Eddie's Father,I Remember Mama, Bambi,Citizen of the Galaxy,On Borrowed Time- just to name a few off the top of my head.The cast is terrific too, with the lovely Zooey Deschanel (Elf) as the teacher, and, really getting the point across with exceptional acting, Josh Hutcherson (Little Manhattan), Anna Sophia Robb (Because of Winn-Dixie), and Robert Patrick (The X-Files).  The fact that some critics were so affected by the death in the film is a testament to the effectiveness of the movie, especially Hutcherson's acting, as well as that of Robert Patrick and Anna-Sophia Robb (there's no actual death scene in the film, so it's really Hutcherson's reaction that's so affecting).By the way, if you enjoyedLittle Manhattan, this one has some similarities including the same fine acting by Hutcherson and some brief special effects sequences representing the children's imagination -- though this is more serioius and somewhat sadder.",5,Best kid's film in decades.,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,2318,"['Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'one', 'best', 'children', 'fantasy', 'films', 'decades', 'comparable', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'andExplorers', 'couple', 'favorites', ""'80s"", 'opinion', 'even', 'better', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'many', 'Narnia', 'fans', 'agree', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'fantasy', 'just', 'few', 'sequences', 'imagination', 'two', 'child', 'protagonists', 'story', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'useful', 'lessons', 'whole', 'family', 'including', 'practical', 'demonstration', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'quotation', 'Far', 'away', 'best', 'prize', 'life', 'offers', 'chance', 'work', 'hard', 'work', 'worth', 'doing', 'much', 'more.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', '4,000', 'movies', 'includig', 'least', '3', '4', 'new', 'ones', 'month', 'favorite', 'years', 'certainly', 'best', 'past', 'six', 'months', 'favorite', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'Prestige', 'like', 'more', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'more', 'serious', 'see', 'other', 'reviewers', 'making', 'much', 'fact', 'movie', 'sad', 'part', 'what', 'sadder', 'so', 'many', 'supposedly', 'adult', 'viewers', 'can', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'miss', 'point', 'movie', 'message', 'more', 'complicated', 'bang', 'think', 'children', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'shielded', 'knowledge', 'death', 'censoring', 'fiction', 'Think', 'how', 'many', 'wonderful', 'books', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'spoiled', '-A', 'Dog', 'Flanders', 'My', 'Girl', 'A', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', 'Courtship', 'Eddie', 'Father', 'Remember', 'Mama', 'Bambi', 'Citizen', 'Galaxy', 'Borrowed', 'Time-', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'top', 'head.The', 'cast', 'terrific', 'too', 'lovely', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Elf', 'teacher', 'really', 'getting', 'point', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Little', 'Manhattan', 'Anna', 'Sophia', 'Robb', 'Winn-Dixie', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'X-Files', 'fact', 'critics', 'were', 'so', 'affected', 'death', 'film', 'testament', 'effectiveness', 'movie', 'especially', 'Hutcherson', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Anna-Sophia', 'Robb', 'actual', 'death', 'scene', 'film', 'really', 'Hutcherson', 'reaction', 'so', 'affecting', 'way', 'enjoyedLittle', 'Manhattan', 'one', 'similarities', 'including', 'same', 'fine', 'acting', 'Hutcherson', 'brief', 'special', 'effects', 'sequences', 'representing', 'children', 'imagination', 'more', 'serioius', 'somewhat', 'sadder']",Bridge to Terabithia
652298,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B00005JPL5,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 2]","Bridge to Terabithia is a film that captures the imagination. But behind the imagination, it is a film about being a kid and developing friendships as well as conflicting experiences that children also have to deal with.  And with most Disney films, there is a moral behind the story that is accentuated with the main character Jess Anderson (Josh Hutcherson).Jess is a boy who lives with three sisters and loves to draw.  Throughout the film he draws in his sketchbook, but his father does no understand him.  His world somewhat lightens up during the first day of class when a new girl shows up, Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb), who also happens to live next door to his house, and helps him to see that he is talented.  And straight to the chase, the two become friends and spend time together sharing anecdotes about each of their lives.  One day they venture out into a wooded area where they create a world of their own; they are free to be anything they want, and the world is indeed their oyster.Bridge to Terabithia also confronts childhood dilemmas. Who has not been taunted by a bully, a person who tries to dominate one's world?  Janice (Lauren Clinton), an eighth-grader, is the school bully who refuses entry to all who need to use the girl's room, and the only way to pass is to pay her a dollar.  Jess's sister, May Belle (Bailee Anderson), is constantly bullied by Janice in a very childish manner, taking Bailee's twinkie or refusing her entry to the restroom.  But it is surprising to see how the tables are turned on her, and how she is portrayed in Jess and Leslie's forest of imagination.  In addition, the concluding scenes in the film takes on a serious issue that slightly changes the mood of the film.Bridge to Terabithia emphasizes kindness and unselfishness toward others.  And for those who remember playing in a tree-house or playing in the woods and enrapturing one's self in a world of pure imagination, this film will definitely conjure up childhood memories.",4,A world filled with imagination,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,1985,"['Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'film', 'imagination', 'imagination', 'film', 'being', 'kid', 'developing', 'friendships', 'as', 'well', 'conflicting', 'experiences', 'children', 'also', 'have', 'deal', 'most', 'Disney', 'films', 'moral', 'story', 'accentuated', 'main', 'character', 'Jess', 'Anderson', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', '.Jess', 'boy', 'who', 'three', 'sisters', 'draw', 'film', 'sketchbook', 'father', 'understand', 'world', 'somewhat', 'up', 'first', 'day', 'class', 'when', 'new', 'girl', 'up', 'Leslie', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'who', 'also', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'house', 'see', 'talented', 'straight', 'chase', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'sharing', 'anecdotes', 'lives', 'One', 'day', 'venture', 'out', 'wooded', 'area', 'where', 'create', 'world', 'own', 'are', 'free', 'be', 'anything', 'want', 'world', 'indeed', 'oyster.Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'also', 'childhood', 'dilemmas', 'Who', 'not', 'been', 'taunted', 'bully', 'person', 'who', 'dominate', 'one', 'world', 'Janice', 'Lauren', 'Clinton', 'eighth-grader', 'school', 'bully', 'who', 'entry', 'who', 'need', 'use', 'girl', 'room', 'only', 'way', 'pass', 'pay', 'dollar', 'Jess', 'sister', 'May', 'Belle', 'Bailee', 'Anderson', 'constantly', 'bullied', 'Janice', 'very', 'childish', 'manner', 'taking', 'Bailee', 'twinkie', 'refusing', 'entry', 'restroom', 'surprising', 'see', 'how', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'how', 'portrayed', 'Jess', 'Leslie', 'forest', 'imagination', 'addition', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'film', 'serious', 'issue', 'slightly', 'mood', 'film.Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'kindness', 'unselfishness', 'others', 'who', 'remember', 'playing', 'tree-house', 'playing', 'woods', 'enrapturing', 'one', 'self', 'world', 'pure', 'imagination', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'conjure', 'up', 'childhood', 'memories']",Bridge to Terabithia

He did a fine job. I have not ever seen a film that treated so well the interplay between light and darkness, wonder and drudgery, that we experience in daily life.This is also a story about the need for fantasy. Early in the film the girl character tells the boy character that they need a place with none of the sort of bullies and tormentors they have to deal with at Junior High. Strangely enough, when they go into their imaginary fantasy world they find they have not managed to leave their real life enemies behind, only changed them into CG creatures. Through play-acting and imagination, the two young teenagers learn courage and compassion that they can then apply to their real life problems. It is a comforting, classic coming-of-age tale, until you get to the end.Those of you who have read the book know it has a devastating downer of an ending. Take hope. This is a Disney film after all.

He's a growing boy in a household of four sisters and poor to boot.  So he's got to wear his sister's hand-me-down sneakers with pink stripes and he definitely catches it from the guys.He finds friendship with the new girl, Leslie Burke (Robb), who may be able to outrun him, but has similar problems with being different when she discloses she has no television after an essay is required based on a TV show. Together, they explore the woods behind their next-door homes and build a world of fantasy only they share.While you do see trolls and other creatures, the story is more about kids imaginations than made-up worlds.  ""Bridge"" is a lovely tale and another step kids need to take to adulthood.I would not advise this film to parents with really young kids--and even those contemporary to Jess and Leslie may have some issues with some of the subject matter (death).

652310,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPL5,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""Bridge to Terabithia"" is that rare movie about enchantment that really is enchanting.  Based on the novel by Katherine Paterson, this is like a more kid-friendly version of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" in that both films deal with unhappy children who retreat into a fully realized world of fantasy - the difference being that, in this case at least, it is a world seemingly of their own making.Jesse Aarons, a local farm boy, is a regular target of bullies at school, while Leslie Burke is the new kid in town, never an easy thing to be when you're an underclassman in a school full of obnoxious, belligerent eighth graders who don`t mind showing you who`s boss every time you walk down the hallway or dare to use the lavatory.  The two new friends obviously need a place to get away from their troubles, so in the forest nearby, they create the imaginary kingdom of Terabithia, filled with wondrous creatures and non-threatening ogres, that becomes increasingly actualized as the story goes on.""Bridge to Terabithia"" succeeds by  keeping it uncluttered and simple and by focusing more on the daily lives of Jesse and Leslie than on their adventures in the forest.  Fantasy, the film seems to be saying, is for those special times when reality gets to be just a bit too much to handle, but that the real, everyday world is the place we all must inhabit for most of our time here on earth.  The movie is all in favor of childhood imagination, but not at the expense of real world experiences and relationships.The tricky premise  is brought to charming cinematic life by writers Jeff Stockwell and David Paterson, director Gabor Csupo, and the special effects experts who understand that less is often more when it comes to making the fantastical real and believable on screen.  But primary credit goes to the utterly winning performances by Josh Hutcherson, Anna Sophia Robb, and six-year old Bailee Madison, who, as Jesse's adorable kid sister, reminds one of Drew Barrymore in her early ""E.T."" days.  All three do a lovely job embodying the youthful exuberance and openhearted wonder that are so much a part of the movie's vision and theme.Parents should note that, while the movie may be too emotionally wrenching for very young children (there`s an unusually stark plot development towards the end of the film), it is ideal viewing for slightly older kids and younger teens.

There is the relationship between the father and son, but that is never given any real motivation, developed in any meaningful way, and ends in a reconciliation without ever offering any rationale.  Then there is the interrelations between the family members that is hinted at but not explored.  Of course there is the almost plot regarding the school bullies, but that is set up and then abandoned as a plot line so it is never brought to any sort of point or conclusion.  Of course there is the relationship between Jess and Leslie which apparently is intended as the plot and it gets the most attention but it never seems to go anywhere which is unfortunate because this could have been a glorious film, but Terribithia appears in only the last two minutes of the film.  So the imagination which should have driven the film was hinted at but never developed.  Then there was the art and the art teacher which was again introduced as a possible subplot but then abandoned.  This entire film consisted of potential plot lines that are never explored leaving the entire film as a hash of directionless and pointless actions.  Then because there was no point and no plot bringing the film to any sort of conclusion required the death, which was again pointless and contributed nothing to the film, other than to stop the action and end the film.I gave the film two stars as a charitable contribution to the actors who did their best with a bad screen play.",2,Sad Story Looking For a Plot,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,1697,"['sad', 'film', 'never', 'develop', 'point', 'plot', 'then', 'screen', 'writer', 'character', 's', 'just', 'end', 'pain', 'Actually', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'beginnings', 'none', 'ever', 'seem', 'develop', 'go', 'anywhere', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'never', 'given', 'real', 'motivation', 'developed', 'meaningful', 'way', 'reconciliation', 'ever', 'offering', 'rationale', 'Then', 'interrelations', 'family', 'members', 'hinted', 'not', 'explored', 'course', 'almost', 'plot', 'regarding', 'school', 'bullies', 'set', 'up', 'then', 'abandoned', 'plot', 'line', 'never', 'brought', 'sort', 'point', 'conclusion', 'course', 'relationship', 'Jess', 'Leslie', 'apparently', 'intended', 'plot', 'most', 'attention', 'never', 'go', 'anywhere', 'unfortunate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'glorious', 'film', 'Terribithia', 'only', 'last', 'two', 'minutes', 'film', 'imagination', 'should', 'have', 'driven', 'film', 'was', 'hinted', 'never', 'developed', 'Then', 'was', 'art', 'art', 'teacher', 'was', 'again', 'introduced', 'possible', 'subplot', 'then', 'abandoned', 'entire', 'film', 'consisted', 'potential', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'never', 'explored', 'leaving', 'entire', 'film', 'hash', 'directionless', 'pointless', 'actions', 'Then', 'was', 'point', 'plot', 'bringing', 'film', 'sort', 'conclusion', 'required', 'death', 'was', 'again', 'pointless', 'contributed', 'nothing', 'film', 'other', 'stop', 'action', 'end', 'film.I', 'gave', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'charitable', 'contribution', 'actors', 'who', 'did', 'best', 'bad', 'screen', 'play']",Bridge to Terabithia

My oldest was captivated. My middle-guy thought that it as ""awesome"". When I asked my youngest if it was a good movie...well...I got a ""no"". But my youngest was definitely as captivated as my oldest. In fact, this was originally a rental for us, but we picked up the Blu-ray edition after my youngest was so upset when I returned the rental.Here's the thing: They just don't make movies like Bridge to Terabithia for kids anymore; or, if they do, it usually gets smacked with a PG-13. But Bridge to Terabithia is no more frightening or deep than The Wizard of OzThe Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition), My GirlMy Girlor Old YellerOld Yeller (Vault Disney Collection).Bridge to Terabithia is much more about childhood issues and dealing with them than fantasy and folklore. It's also a tale of what tweens might do to have fun--use their imagination--in their spare time....They dream of a magic place where they are The King and Queen of Terabithia. (The movie is based on the 1977 children's novel of the same name by Katherine Paterson,Bridge to Terabithia.) This movie will also present that life is not always so rosy at times, so if you're the type that wants to hide that fact from your kids then you might be disappointed with Bridge to Terabithia.In the film, one of the kids is even invited by his teacher (Zooey Deschanel) on what ultimately ends up being a private excursion to a museum; and I must say that during the scene my wife and I looked at each other and we were like, ""Oh no, what's going on here?"" Well...nothing....The female teacher took the young male student (who indeed clearly had a crush on the teacher) to a museum. Nothing else. It just goes to show what a different world we live in today where you (sadly) can't trust a situation like that from the days of Old Yeller where Barney Fife might show up and not arrest the teacher, but instead suggest that they all stop by the local ice cream parlor on the way home.Bridge to Terabithia is a very good movie...a family movie...that might frighten at times; it might make a kid think at times; and it might make a kid cry here and there.",4,My Girl Crosses the Bridge to Terabithia to Meet Old Yeller in Oz,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,2540,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'MPAA', 'gave', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'PG', 'rating', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'restrictive', 'rating', 'MPAA', 'so', 'conservative', 'days', 'movies', 'kids', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'deep', 'might', 'make', 'child', 'sad', '.Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'indeed', 'kid', 'movie', 'couple', 'kids', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'turning', 'couple', 'moving', 'performances', 'oldest', 'was', 'captivated', 'middle-guy', 'thought', 'awesome', 'When', 'asked', 'youngest', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'got', 'youngest', 'was', 'definitely', 'as', 'captivated', 'oldest', 'fact', 'was', 'originally', 'rental', 'picked', 'up', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'youngest', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'when', 'returned', 'rental.Here', 'thing', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'kids', 'anymore', 'do', 'usually', 'smacked', 'PG-13', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'more', 'frightening', 'deep', 'Wizard', 'OzThe', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'My', 'GirlMy', 'Girlor', 'Old', 'YellerOld', 'Yeller', 'Vault', 'Disney', 'Collection', '.Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'much', 'more', 'childhood', 'issues', 'dealing', 'fantasy', 'folklore', 'also', 'tale', 'what', 'tweens', 'might', 'do', 'have', 'fun', 'use', 'imagination', 'spare', 'time', '.They', 'dream', 'magic', 'place', 'where', 'are', 'King', 'Queen', 'Terabithia', 'movie', 'based', '1977', 'children', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'movie', 'will', 'also', 'present', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'rosy', 'times', 'so', ""'re"", 'type', 'hide', 'fact', 'kids', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia.In', 'film', 'one', 'kids', 'even', 'invited', 'teacher', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'what', 'ultimately', 'up', 'being', 'private', 'excursion', 'museum', 'must', 'say', 'scene', 'wife', 'looked', 'other', 'were', 'like', 'Oh', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'Well', 'nothing', 'female', 'teacher', 'took', 'young', 'male', 'student', 'who', 'indeed', 'clearly', 'had', 'crush', 'teacher', 'museum', 'Nothing', 'else', 'just', 'show', 'what', 'different', 'world', 'live', 'today', 'where', 'sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'situation', 'days', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'where', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'might', 'show', 'up', 'not', 'arrest', 'teacher', 'instead', 'suggest', 'stop', 'local', 'ice', 'cream', 'parlor', 'way', 'home.Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'family', 'movie', 'might', 'frighten', 'times', 'might', 'make', 'kid', 'think', 'times', 'might', 'make', 'kid', 'cry', 'here', 'there']",Bridge to Terabithia

Everyone deserves a second chance.If you are expecting Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Narnia constant special effects, you will likely be disappointed because Terabithia is all about Imagination and encouraging all of us to use it.

652320,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00005JPL5,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[2, 3]","What more can I say that hasn't been said? Bridge to Terabithia is based on a much-loved children's book and essentially sticks to the spirit of the book. First thing to know is that this movie is NOT a fantasy tale. Apparently the promoters thought to take advantage of the ""from the makers of the Narnia movies"" and market the movie as such. While there are fantastic elements they are all just visualizations of a child's imagination. With that in mind the CGI effects that bring the fantastic elements to life are not the showcase of the movie, which is a good idea. Now that we have that out of the way on to what the movie is really about.This is a coming of age story at its core. The main protagonist has a tough life in his eyes and throughout the movie he learns things that end up changing his entire view on it. When you are 10-11 years old your enemies are simply kids and teachers who are mean to you. Your pain is not getting the attention of your family. Your tribulations evolve around day to day challenges. What BtT shows is how a young boy's friendship with a free-spirited girl starts opening up new possibilities for his life. Nothing grandiose or epic like saving the family farm or making the winning shot in a game. This is all internal. Jess (the young buy) realizes there is more to those kids who pick on him and learns to understand why. He also learns some hard life lessons.This movie isn't all cutesy with kids playing in the forest with no cares on the world. Sure there is a level of escapism, but it is put in its appropriate place in time. As the movie progresses things get serious... just like life. The way this segue is handled is what makes this movie worth it. Characters evolve and grow in the movie right before your eyes. The ending felt a bit stunted to me as if it didn't really address or resolve what the movie was setting up. But then again that's how life it. You take it one day at a time.The acting in this movie is top notch. Josh Hutcherson convinces you he is a kid lost in angst yet hopeful of something better. AnnaSophia Robb nails the role of his sprite-like companion. Robert Patrick plays the distant dad that doesn't know how to show love to his son with such subtlety and heart he continues to keep me interested in what part he's going to play next. Lots of good performances all around from both the child and adult actors/actresses.Production values looks really high on this film with effective cinematography, nice music (although I could do with a little less of the pop music stuff) and good pacing. The CGI looks pretty good all things considered... until you get the end of the movie. I dunno if the animators got lazy or if the films $30 million budget dried up, but the final CGI scene looks very out of place in regards to how it interacts with the real world footage. The CG characters were neat and all, but the whole thing just didn't fit right. Considering that production budget and what they did accomplish on the movie as a whole I can forgive the limitation. It's just very noticeable.This Blu-Ray is in 1080p using MPEG-4 as the video codec on a 1.85:1 aspect ratio (no black bars on widescreen HD tv's?). The nature scenes look great in HD. The audio is uncompressed 24 bit PCM, which is about as true to the source audio as you can get. This is a great surround mix too. The extra features are a little sparse if you're the type that expects a lot of goodies in your Blu-Ray. Here's a run down:Audio Commentaries - One with director Gabor Csupso, screenwriter Jeff Stockwell and producer Hal Lieberman. A second one with producer Lauren Levine and actors Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb. Haven't heard the commentaries. Will update if I do.Behind the Book: The themes of Bridge To Terabithia - A series of interviews with the writer of the book and the producer of the movie (who happens to be the same person the original book was written for) as well as a host of others. They essentially give you some light light about what the book (and movie) are about. Not bad, but not engrossing either.Digital Imagination: Bringing Bridge To Terabithia to Life - A quick featurette touching on the special effects of the movie and WETA's involvement. Not a lot of meat on this one either, but it is informative.Keep Your Mind Wide Open - Disney styled music video performed by AnnaSophia Robb. Interestingly enough this is the one standard definition extra... coming in at 480p instead of 1080p.Movie trailers - Lots of them that want to come in and start before you see the movie. I hate when Disney does that.This is a movie for kids between 8 and 12 for the most part. At least they are the ones that will get the most out of it. If you have youngsters about that age and want them to experience a movie that can show then how to see the world with a more open mind then Bridge to Terabithia is right up your alley.",4,Modern

652321,A1ZZ2EB6FCY8MW,B00005JPL5,"Staci L. Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[16, 18]","Katherine Paterson's Bridge to Terabithia YA 1977 novel is a classic. One I never read when I was a kid, but I understand it's quite beloved and indeed sacred to some -- not the least of which is Paterson's son David, for whom the book was written and who also shares a screenwriting credit on the film. So, everything had to be just right: from the human-being casting, to the use of special effects which help bring the fantasy kingdom of Terabithia to life.When the movie came out on the big screen earlier this year every trailer, TV spot and preview showed trolls, ogres, and magical, spontaneously self-buildings bridges springing up. It looked like Lord of Rings on kiddie-safe steroids. But the movie itself isn't about all that, which understandably wrought a bit of a backlash from those not familiar with the novel's very real, grounded themes about regular kids and their very normal day-to-day struggles.The story follows Jesse (Josh Hutcherson), a fifth-grader who's not terribly popular. There is nothing wrong with him, but there's nothing ""right"" either. He's not outgoing, rich or popular, but he is something of an athlete -- that is, until the new student in his class, a slip of a girl named Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) beats him in a footrace. At first, he holds a grudge but before long the two dreamy, artistic kids become best friends, and allies against the school's bully brigade. Their secret refuge is a tree-house in the woods, a place Leslie calls Terabithia. The children imagine all sorts of wondrous and scary things there, in an attempt to free their minds from their otherwise troubled lives (Jesse's parents are struggling financially, while only-child Leslie feels neglected by her busy dad and mom).Since Disney optioned this book, you can bet there's some tears to be jerked -- but it's an ultimately uplifting, beautiful and honest portrayal of life-lessons learnt in childhood. Hutcherson and Robb are very well-cast and their acting is pretty much flawless (none of the ""cutesy"" or ""obnoxious"" child-actor antics here). Real kudos go to director Gabor Csupo, who not only grasped (as best as I can tell) the source material, but added cinematic dimension to it for those who are not familiar with the novel. (I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with his next project, The Moon Princess -- based on a book I did read, and loved!, as a child: The Little White Horse, by Elizabeth Goudge).The DVD offers an array of extras (and nice supplements, such as closed captions for the hearing-impaired), my favorite of which was a solid featurette on Katherine Paterson's Bridge to Terabithia novel. It offers interviews not only with the author herself, but insight from teachers who've assigned the book to their classes over the years, plus excerpts from the text and illustrations.Over all, Bridge to Terabithia is a definite must-buy DVD for kids and Disney-weaned adults alike.",5,When Reality Becomes Dreams,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,2920,"['Katherine', 'Paterson', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'YA', '1977', 'novel', 'classic', 'One', 'never', 'read', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'understand', 'quite', 'beloved', 'indeed', 'sacred', 'not', 'least', 'Paterson', 'son', 'David', 'whom', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'who', 'also', 'shares', 'screenwriting', 'credit', 'film', 'So', 'everything', 'had', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'human-being', 'casting', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'help', 'bring', 'fantasy', 'kingdom', 'Terabithia', 'life.When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'big', 'screen', 'earlier', 'year', 'trailer', 'TV', 'spot', 'preview', 'showed', 'trolls', 'ogres', 'magical', 'spontaneously', 'self-buildings', 'bridges', 'springing', 'up', 'looked', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'kiddie-safe', 'steroids', 'movie', ""n't"", 'understandably', 'wrought', 'bit', 'backlash', 'not', 'familiar', 'novel', 'very', 'real', 'grounded', 'themes', 'regular', 'kids', 'very', 'normal', 'day-to-day', 'struggles.The', 'story', 'Jesse', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'fifth-grader', 'who', 'not', 'terribly', 'popular', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'nothing', 'right', 'either', 'not', 'outgoing', 'rich', 'popular', 'something', 'athlete', 'new', 'student', 'class', 'slip', 'girl', 'named', 'Leslie', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'footrace', 'first', 'grudge', 'long', 'two', 'dreamy', 'artistic', 'kids', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'allies', 'school', 'bully', 'brigade', 'secret', 'refuge', 'tree-house', 'woods', 'place', 'Leslie', 'Terabithia', 'children', 'imagine', 'sorts', 'wondrous', 'scary', 'things', 'there', 'attempt', 'free', 'minds', 'otherwise', 'troubled', 'lives', 'Jesse', 'parents', 'are', 'struggling', 'financially', 'only-child', 'Leslie', 'feels', 'neglected', 'busy', 'dad', 'mom', '.Since', 'Disney', 'optioned', 'book', 'can', 'bet', 'tears', 'be', 'jerked', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'beautiful', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'life-lessons', 'learnt', 'childhood', 'Hutcherson', 'Robb', 'are', 'very', 'well-cast', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'flawless', 'none', 'cutesy', 'obnoxious', 'child-actor', 'antics', 'here', 'Real', 'kudos', 'go', 'director', 'Gabor', 'Csupo', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'grasped', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'tell', 'source', 'material', 'added', 'cinematic', 'dimension', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'novel', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'next', 'project', 'Moon', 'Princess', 'based', 'book', 'did', 'read', 'loved', 'child', 'Little', 'White', 'Horse', 'Elizabeth', 'Goudge', '.The', 'DVD', 'array', 'extras', 'nice', 'supplements', 'such', 'closed', 'captions', 'hearing-impaired', 'favorite', 'was', 'solid', 'featurette', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'novel', 'interviews', 'not', 'only', 'author', 'insight', 'teachers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'assigned', 'book', 'classes', 'years', 'excerpts', 'text', 'illustrations.Over', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'definite', 'must-buy', 'DVD', 'kids', 'Disney-weaned', 'adults', 'alike']",Bridge to Terabithia

But like anybody looking to see this movie, you should be warned before watching that there is a death that happens in the movie, and I perfer not to spoil it for you, of who dies in this movie, but thankfully the death occurs off the screen. The book was written by Katherine Paterson, and now they have the film version. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is beginning a new schol year, and spents part of the first morning running around his family's farm. His father Jack Aarons (Robert Patrick) works at a hardware store, and also runs the farm, and is also strict as stern. Jesse has 4 sisters, and he is the only boy out of the family. The new school year brings Jesse 2 teachers, if he has more, the others are off the screen, they are Mrs. Myers (Jen Wolfe) and music teacher Ms. Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel). The first day also brings a new classmate, a girl named Leslie Burke (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's AnnaSophia Robb), who also enters a race that Jesse has been trainning for. But they soon become best friends, along with being neighbors. There are also 2 bullies at the school Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton) who even stands outside the women's bathroom, and charges $1.00 just to use it. Growing tired of their home, and school lives, Jesse and Leslie creates their own world, which they become rulers of, which they name Terabithia. They keep their new world a secret from their own famiies, which includes Jesse's younger sister May Belle Aarons (Bailee Madison), who just wants to even spent time with them, even if it does bother Jesse.",5,"From the people that brought you The Chronicles of Narnia, brings you Bridge to Terabithia",1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,1788,"['Disney', 'brough', 'film', 'version', 'book', 'called', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'not', 'are', 'famliar', 'book', 'should', 'have', 'fun', 'not', 'so', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'anybody', 'looking', 'see', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'watching', 'death', 'movie', 'perfer', 'not', 'spoil', 'who', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'death', 'screen', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'now', 'have', 'film', 'version', 'Jesse', 'Aarons', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'beginning', 'new', 'schol', 'year', 'spents', 'part', 'first', 'morning', 'running', 'family', 'farm', 'father', 'Jack', 'Aarons', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'hardware', 'store', 'also', 'farm', 'also', 'strict', 'stern', 'Jesse', '4', 'sisters', 'only', 'boy', 'family', 'new', 'school', 'year', 'Jesse', '2', 'teachers', 'more', 'others', 'are', 'screen', 'are', 'Mrs.', 'Myers', 'Jen', 'Wolfe', 'music', 'teacher', 'Ms.', 'Edmonds', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'first', 'day', 'also', 'new', 'classmate', 'girl', 'named', 'Leslie', 'Burke', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'who', 'also', 'race', 'Jesse', 'been', 'trainning', 'soon', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'being', 'neighbors', 'are', 'also', '2', 'bullies', 'school', 'Scott', 'Hoager', 'Cameron', 'Wakefield', 'Janice', 'Avery', 'Lauren', 'Clinton', 'who', 'even', 'women', 'bathroom', '1.00', 'just', 'use', 'Growing', 'tired', 'home', 'school', 'lives', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'own', 'world', 'become', 'rulers', 'name', 'Terabithia', 'keep', 'new', 'world', 'secret', 'own', 'famiies', 'Jesse', 'younger', 'sister', 'May', 'Belle', 'Aarons', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'who', 'just', 'even', 'spent', 'time', 'even', 'bother', 'Jesse']",Bridge to Terabithia

It started telling the story of a young boy who is tormented by classmates and later becomes friends with a girl who moves into the house next door.  I thought the development of their relationship was wonderful. She opens his eyes to adventure and wonder and the movie is truly magical in that aspect. My husband started watching and quickly became bored. I have to agree there were several periods of slow pacing that could have used better editing. About 2/3 of the way through the movie I had just said to him, ""Honey, this is really a nice family-kind of fantasy story. I think the kids will like it"", when the boy walks into the house and his family is upset about where he has been. My mouth dropped open when they told him why they were worried. I did not see that coming at all. In fact, I went from saying what a good family movie it was...to tears. I was shocked at the turn this story took, because there was no warning about what was coming, either in the trailer or any type of foreshadowing. For older kids, this might be the basis for talking about death, water safety, etc...but that is not how this movie was portrayed.The actress playing the young girl was phenomenal, believable and I wanted to give her a big hug for the kindness she showed to the boy in his mean world. The girl was obviously loved, but her parents only had time for her during times when they were not busy, which was seldom.

Outstanding performances by child stars AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson drive the film, which delves into the world of imagination, fantasy and the circumvention of unpleasant realities. The staggeringly tragic elements in the film are almost too morose for younger audiences, but brings with it meaningful lessons in morality, values and acknowledgement for the importance of friendships.The fastest kid in the fifth grade, Jess (Josh Hutcherson), reluctantly befriends the new student Leslie (AnnaSophia) when they realize they are not only neighbors, but comparable outsiders in their class. Encountering the typical struggles of elementary school kids, such as bullies and not fitting in with the ""cool"" kids, Leslie teaches Jess to use his imagination more frequently to escape whatever unpleasantries he might face. Together they convert a debilitated, abandoned tree-house deep in the forest into their own magical kingdom named Terabithia, and they visit it each day to daydream and live out their fantasies as noble rulers of their realm. When tragic events disrupt their peaceful play, newfound lessons in believing the impossible help them overcome utter heartbreak.The two stars AnnaSophia Robb (who you may recognize from 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and Josh Hutcherson are markedly phenomenal and embody Paterson's characters with such authenticity and sincerity that your eyes will be glued to the screen. You feel for these characters, relate to them and recognize their reasoning. Their adolescent imaginations are inspirational and memorable, as they realize that conceiving a fictitious world to govern is a harmless escape from reality that fuels their creativity and happiness. Several of the other characters, including their classmates and Josh's father (Robert Patrick, the T-1000) are properly stereotypical; we see every familiar niche from school, including the bullies, the cool kids, and the nerds. These patterned figures enhance our understanding for Leslie and Jess, solidify their outsider stances, and justify nearly all of their actions. Zooey Deschanel plays Miss Edmunds, the music teacher, who classically and humorously creates a love triangle for Jess. Entranced by his teacher, and later blaming himself for inconsiderately trying to spend time with her as opposed to Leslie, this innocent crush adds to the realism of the 11-year-old's mindset.In the film, Leslie dubs their imaginary kingdom ""Terabithia"" which is supposedly a made-up name devised on the spur of the moment. However, one of the aspects the film leaves out, probably to avoid any comparisons to the incredibly popular Chronicles of Narnia, is that Leslie has read and enjoyed Narnia and other C.S. Lewis stories, and designs her kingdom around the ground-rules set forth in those books. One of Lewis' stories contains an island named Terebinthia, which Leslie purportedly would have subconsciously borrowed when naming the magical land. (There is also a tree found in the bible called a terebinth tree, so Lewis may not have been all that original either.)For anyone who has read the novel and enjoyed it, this film is an amazingly faithful adaptation, and will certainly appeal to those existing fans. More interestingly though, will be the reactions of newcomers who are not yet familiar with the events of the story. It's difficult to discuss the film without giving away major plot points, and ironically the filmmakers sent out publications and press kits with written pleas to journalists not to give away those monumental details. The story is well worth reading, and the movie well worth watching, targeting families and more specifically elementary school students. My advice is to simply see the film for yourself, as it is loaded with thought-provoking themes and morals that may be difficult to discuss and easier to watch through the use of this revelatory visual delight.- Mike Massie, [...]",4,Bridge To Terabithia Review from [...],1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,4066,"['Magnificently', 'adapted', 'acclaimed', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'novel', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'enticingly', 'unique', 'children', 'fantasy', 'Outstanding', 'performances', 'child', 'stars', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'drive', 'film', 'world', 'imagination', 'fantasy', 'circumvention', 'unpleasant', 'realities', 'staggeringly', 'tragic', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'morose', 'younger', 'audiences', 'meaningful', 'lessons', 'morality', 'values', 'acknowledgement', 'importance', 'friendships.The', 'fastest', 'kid', 'fifth', 'grade', 'Jess', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'reluctantly', 'new', 'student', 'Leslie', 'AnnaSophia', 'when', 'realize', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'neighbors', 'comparable', 'outsiders', 'class', 'Encountering', 'typical', 'struggles', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids', 'such', 'bullies', 'not', 'fitting', 'cool', 'kids', 'Leslie', 'Jess', 'use', 'imagination', 'more', 'frequently', 'escape', 'unpleasantries', 'might', 'face', 'Together', 'convert', 'debilitated', 'abandoned', 'tree-house', 'deep', 'forest', 'own', 'magical', 'kingdom', 'named', 'Terabithia', 'visit', 'day', 'daydream', 'live', 'out', 'fantasies', 'noble', 'rulers', 'realm', 'When', 'tragic', 'events', 'disrupt', 'peaceful', 'play', 'newfound', 'lessons', 'believing', 'impossible', 'help', 'overcome', 'utter', 'heartbreak.The', 'two', 'stars', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'who', 'may', 'recognize', '2005', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'are', 'markedly', 'phenomenal', 'embody', 'Paterson', 'characters', 'such', 'authenticity', 'sincerity', 'eyes', 'will', 'be', 'glued', 'screen', 'feel', 'characters', 'relate', 'recognize', 'reasoning', 'adolescent', 'imaginations', 'are', 'inspirational', 'memorable', 'realize', 'conceiving', 'fictitious', 'world', 'govern', 'harmless', 'escape', 'reality', 'creativity', 'happiness', 'Several', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'classmates', 'Josh', 'father', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'T-1000', 'are', 'properly', 'stereotypical', 'see', 'familiar', 'niche', 'school', 'including', 'bullies', 'cool', 'kids', 'nerds', 'patterned', 'figures', 'enhance', 'understanding', 'Leslie', 'Jess', 'solidify', 'outsider', 'stances', 'justify', 'nearly', 'actions', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Miss', 'Edmunds', 'music', 'teacher', 'who', 'classically', 'humorously', 'love', 'triangle', 'Jess', 'Entranced', 'teacher', 'later', 'blaming', 'inconsiderately', 'trying', 'spend', 'time', 'opposed', 'Leslie', 'innocent', 'crush', 'realism', '11-year-old', 'mindset.In', 'film', 'Leslie', 'dubs', 'imaginary', 'kingdom', 'Terabithia', 'supposedly', 'made-up', 'name', 'devised', 'spur', 'moment', 'However', 'one', 'aspects', 'film', 'out', 'probably', 'avoid', 'comparisons', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Leslie', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'Narnia', 'other', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'stories', 'kingdom', 'ground-rules', 'set', 'forth', 'books', 'One', 'Lewis', 'stories', 'island', 'named', 'Terebinthia', 'Leslie', 'purportedly', 'would', 'have', 'subconsciously', 'borrowed', 'when', 'naming', 'magical', 'land', 'also', 'tree', 'found', 'bible', 'called', 'terebinth', 'tree', 'Lewis', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'original', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'novel', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'amazingly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'will', 'certainly', 'appeal', 'existing', 'fans', 'More', 'interestingly', 'will', 'be', 'reactions', 'newcomers', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'familiar', 'events', 'story', 'difficult', 'discuss', 'film', 'giving', 'away', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'ironically', 'filmmakers', 'sent', 'out', 'publications', 'press', 'kits', 'written', 'pleas', 'journalists', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'monumental', 'details', 'story', 'well', 'worth', 'reading', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'targeting', 'families', 'more', 'specifically', 'elementary', 'school', 'students', 'advice', 'simply', 'see', 'film', 'yourself', 'loaded', 'thought-provoking', 'themes', 'morals', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'discuss', 'easier', 'watch', 'use', 'revelatory', 'visual', 'delight.-', 'Mike', 'Massie', '[', ']']",Bridge to Terabithia

Unfortunately, they made this film. My only theory is that they figured they would save money since they merely had to hire a hack writer to turn the novel into a screenplay. The only problem was they picked a book that was actually good. While this film isn't perfect, it's one of the few diamonds in the rough of 21sy century American cinema. The characters in this movie go to a school where they do nothing but beat on instruments and sing folk songs. They also have recess sometimes where bullies pretty much have the run of the show, even charging exorbitant fees for using the bathroom facilities. If this was your life, you'd want to live in a fantasy world as well. The movie gets of to a great start by having the hero being forced to wear his sisters pink and white shoes to school. Any guy knows that would be his worst nightmare and we immediately sympathize for the kid. What the movie boils down to is how hard it is to be an intelligent person when 90% of mankind are morons. Some wimpy viewers say the movie is just too sad to be a children's film. They'd rather their kids knew nothing about reality and how hard life can be and watch happy films about ogres passing gas. That's fine for those low lifes. But if you want to raise good children that are responsible and have morals, have them watch films like this.

652334,A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ,B00005JPL5,"Tom Knapp ""Rambles.NET editor""","[148, 154]","I watched ""The Bridge to Terabithia"" on a whim with my wife and daughter with little foreknowledge of the plot. I'd never read the Newbery Award-winning book by Katherine Paterson, and I'd seen only one trailer for the film, which left me with the impression it would be a Narnia knock-off. It's not.I'm not dissing ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" which in its way was a remarkable film. But ""Terabithia"" didn't deserve the CGI-laden marketing campaign it received; far from a fantasy blockbuster, this is a deep and thoughtful movie that places substance over sparkle -- a rare treat in the sprawling field of youth-oriented theater. It ranks up there with one of my favorites, ""The Secret of Roan Inish,"" which accomplished more with no special effects than most family-friendly movies could with a billion-dollar budget.But I just can't shake ""Terabithia"" from my head, a fact owed mostly to the performance of AnnaSophia Robb. As Leslie, a spirited young girl with a fiery imagination and endless good cheer, AnnaSophia captured my heart. She's the kind of person you want to know when you're a child and, as my wife remarked midway through the film, she's the sort of young woman you'd be happy to see your daughter grow up to be.An outsider despite her youthful good looks and family wealth, she finds her perfect match in Jesse (Joss Hutcherson), another outsider who has withdrawn into his art to escape a chilly home life and his own problems at school. Together, they discover a secret getaway that might seem like a fairly ordinary patch of woods to most people; to them, it's a magical world replete with fantastic creatures, hidden dangers and amazing triumphs. It's here the special effects intrude more than accentuate the film; the story would have benefited from a vaguer sense of Jesse and Leslie's own wonder. We don't need to see CGI creatures to believe that these two children do.The strength here, besides outstanding performances from the two lead actors, is the impact of a story that knows no amount of fantasy can prevent real-life tragedies from occurring. And the tragedy here -- it's hard to write about it without giving it away -- slams into unsuspecting viewers like a sudden kick to the gut.Parents of younger viewers should be prepared to have a long and serious talk with their children after this movie, but that's not a recommendation to avoid it. ""Terabithia"" deserves to be seen, discussed and seen again. (Although use some discretion; very young children should wait before seeing this.) My thanks to director Gabor Csupo, as well as writer Paterson, for giving kids something honest and real rather than another serving of high-energy fluff.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor",5,A remarkable film,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,2716,"['watched', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'whim', 'wife', 'daughter', 'little', 'foreknowledge', 'plot', ""'d"", 'never', 'read', 'Newbery', 'Award-winning', 'book', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', ""'d"", 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'trailer', 'film', 'left', 'impression', 'would', 'be', 'Narnia', 'knock-off', 'not.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'dissing', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'way', 'was', 'remarkable', 'film', 'Terabithia', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'CGI-laden', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'received', 'far', 'fantasy', 'blockbuster', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'substance', 'sparkle', 'rare', 'treat', 'sprawling', 'field', 'youth-oriented', 'theater', 'there', 'one', 'favorites', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'accomplished', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'family-friendly', 'movies', 'could', 'billion-dollar', 'budget.But', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'Terabithia', 'head', 'fact', 'owed', 'mostly', 'performance', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Leslie', 'spirited', 'young', 'girl', 'fiery', 'imagination', 'endless', 'good', 'cheer', 'AnnaSophia', 'captured', 'heart', 'kind', 'person', 'want', 'know', 'when', ""'re"", 'child', 'wife', 'remarked', 'midway', 'film', 'sort', 'young', 'woman', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'daughter', 'grow', 'be.An', 'outsider', 'youthful', 'good', 'looks', 'family', 'wealth', 'perfect', 'match', 'Jesse', 'Joss', 'Hutcherson', 'outsider', 'who', 'withdrawn', 'art', 'escape', 'chilly', 'home', 'life', 'own', 'problems', 'school', 'Together', 'discover', 'secret', 'getaway', 'might', 'seem', 'fairly', 'ordinary', 'patch', 'woods', 'most', 'people', 'magical', 'world', 'replete', 'fantastic', 'creatures', 'hidden', 'dangers', 'amazing', 'triumphs', 'here', 'special', 'effects', 'intrude', 'more', 'accentuate', 'film', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'vaguer', 'sense', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'own', 'wonder', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'CGI', 'creatures', 'believe', 'two', 'children', 'do.The', 'strength', 'here', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'impact', 'story', 'amount', 'fantasy', 'can', 'prevent', 'real-life', 'tragedies', 'occurring', 'tragedy', 'here', 'hard', 'write', 'giving', 'away', 'slams', 'unsuspecting', 'viewers', 'sudden', 'kick', 'gut.Parents', 'younger', 'viewers', 'should', 'be', 'prepared', 'have', 'long', 'serious', 'talk', 'children', 'movie', 'not', 'recommendation', 'avoid', 'Terabithia', 'be', 'seen', 'discussed', 'seen', 'again', 'use', 'discretion', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'should', 'wait', 'seeing', 'thanks', 'director', 'Gabor', 'Csupo', 'as', 'well', 'writer', 'Paterson', 'giving', 'kids', 'something', 'honest', 'real', 'rather', 'serving', 'high-energy', 'fluff.by', 'Tom', 'Knapp', 'Rambles', 'n', 'e', 't', 'editor']",Bridge to Terabithia

Add to that the fact that Jesse is alienated from his overly strict dad, played by Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), and his unsympathetic sisters - except for his youngest sister, May Belle, played by Bailee Madison. She almost worships the ground he walks on.To deal with their misery, Jesse and Leslie escape into the woods and into a world of imagination, which Jesse feeds with his artwork and Leslie with her writing. On the other side of the river from their homes, they build a kingdom they call Terabithia. There, they find an abandoned tree house, which they renovate and believe turns into their castle whenever they visit. Every afternoon, they cross the river and, together, rule the Kingdom of Terabithia.As their friendship and imaginations grow, they soon have to confront the residents of their imaginary world: horrible harry birds and giant squirrels that attack them mercilessly. There is also a dark prince, whose shadow they see lurking among the trees from time to time. And there is a giant.Outside of each other, the two kids have few friends, except for their music teacher, Miss Edmonds, played by Zooey Deschanel (Elf), who takes an interest in them and their abilities. One day, Miss Edmonds invites Jesse to take a field trip with her to an art museum. The events of that day change everything in Jesse and Leslie's world. I love the scene between Jesse and his dad in each other's arms in the woods as a result of those events. And I love what Jessie does at the end for his sister, May Belle.It's a good cast, and a good story - but it's not exceptional. Gabor Csupo does a good job directing, and Jeff Stockwell and David Paterson do a fine job adapting the book. While the story is timely, in that it deals with a subject that almost every boy faces at that age - alienation from his dad - and almost every student faces at a new school, it is somehow mundane. You would expect the imaginary world to lift the story to an otherworldly level, but it doesn't. Even with animation by the same people who worked on Chronicles Of Narnia and Lord Of The Rings, there just isn't enough of it to do the trick. We spend far too much time in the real, and sometimes boring, world of Junior High.I love the relationships, especially between Jesse and Leslie, Jesse and May Belle, and Jesse and his dad. That is the best part of the film. I was disappointed when I watched the extra features to learn that the creatures in Terabithia were supposed to be adaptations of different ones of the students who persecuted Jesse and Leslie, because that didn't come across at all. I didn't see any resemblance.This was a good effort, but a modest story.Waitsel Smith",4,"GOOD EFFORT, BUT SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING RESULTS",1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,3094,"['Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'good', 'effort', 'standard', 'story', 'hardly', 'typical', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'offering', 'Based', 'book', 'Katherine', 'Paterson', 'story', 'two', 'Middle', 'School', 'then', 'Junior', 'High', 'School', 'children', 'are', 'treated', 'outcasts', 'school', 'Jesse', 'played', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Zathura', 'Leslie', 'played', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Add', 'fact', 'Jesse', 'alienated', 'overly', 'strict', 'dad', 'played', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Terminator', '2', 'unsympathetic', 'sisters', 'youngest', 'sister', 'May', 'Belle', 'played', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'almost', 'worships', 'ground', 'on.To', 'deal', 'misery', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'escape', 'woods', 'world', 'imagination', 'Jesse', 'artwork', 'Leslie', 'writing', 'other', 'side', 'river', 'homes', 'build', 'kingdom', 'call', 'Terabithia', 'find', 'abandoned', 'tree', 'house', 'renovate', 'believe', 'castle', 'whenever', 'visit', 'afternoon', 'cross', 'river', 'together', 'rule', 'Kingdom', 'Terabithia.As', 'friendship', 'imaginations', 'grow', 'soon', 'have', 'confront', 'residents', 'imaginary', 'world', 'horrible', 'harry', 'birds', 'giant', 'squirrels', 'attack', 'mercilessly', 'also', 'dark', 'prince', 'shadow', 'see', 'lurking', 'trees', 'time', 'time', 'giant.Outside', 'other', 'two', 'kids', 'have', 'few', 'friends', 'music', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Edmonds', 'played', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Elf', 'who', 'interest', 'abilities', 'One', 'day', 'Miss', 'Edmonds', 'Jesse', 'take', 'field', 'trip', 'art', 'museum', 'events', 'day', 'change', 'everything', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'world', 'love', 'scene', 'Jesse', 'dad', 'other', 'arms', 'woods', 'result', 'events', 'love', 'what', 'Jessie', 'end', 'sister', 'May', 'Belle.It', 'good', 'cast', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'exceptional', 'Gabor', 'Csupo', 'good', 'job', 'directing', 'Jeff', 'Stockwell', 'David', 'Paterson', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'adapting', 'book', 'story', 'timely', 'subject', 'almost', 'boy', 'age', 'alienation', 'dad', 'almost', 'student', 'new', 'school', 'somehow', 'mundane', 'would', 'expect', 'imaginary', 'world', 'lift', 'story', 'otherworldly', 'level', ""n't"", 'Even', 'animation', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'do', 'trick', 'spend', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'real', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'world', 'Junior', 'High.I', 'love', 'relationships', 'especially', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'Jesse', 'May', 'Belle', 'Jesse', 'dad', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'watched', 'extra', 'features', 'learn', 'creatures', 'Terabithia', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'adaptations', 'different', 'ones', 'students', 'who', 'persecuted', 'Jesse', 'Leslie', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'resemblance.This', 'was', 'good', 'effort', 'modest', 'story.Waitsel', 'Smith']",Bridge to Terabithia

652342,AUTBHG6070SL4,B00005JPL5,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[13, 18]","The story starts in a dismally familiar way - a family with not enough to go around, a school full of bullies, and unique interests that set Jess apart from all the other kids. Then Leslie arrives. The new kid is an outcast too, so Jess and Leslie end up being outcasts together. Leslie has many skills, but one that seems truly magical. She has an overflowing imagination, the kind that envelops everyone around her if they let it. Jess lets himself become part of it, and is suddenly king of a realm filled with giants, winged warriors, and other impossible beings.It's a Disney movie, so it's put together well and it's filled with cute kids and identifiable stereotypes. Special effects are just that - special, used with a light hand until the final scene. The story is easy for kids to understand, but the plot includes a troubling major event from which it never quite seemed to recover. If your little one is at all skittish, you might want to read the book so she's properly prepared for that part of the movie.Only one element of the story looked out of place, where a teacher takes Jess on a Saturday ""field trip"" alone, and with sketchy parental knowledge. The book is over twenty years old now. Maybe, back then, that could seem as safe and encouraging as it was meant to look. We no longer live in that naive world. Although it was in fact quite innocent, it has a dark, creepy appearance to modern eyes. Any parent of young kids will want to have a long talk about that after the movie, or maybe before, or maybe both.Still, it's an enjoyable flick. The child actors are engaging, and the balance of fantasy with gritty reality comes off well. And, whatever you may think of that tragic defining moment, such things really do happen, and kids have to deal with them. If a kid in your life faces a shock of that kind, there might be value in knowing that other kids faces shocks too, and make it through them.//wiredweird",4,Enjoyable story with a touch of magic,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1935,"['story', 'dismally', 'familiar', 'way', 'family', 'not', 'enough', 'go', 'around', 'school', 'full', 'bullies', 'unique', 'interests', 'set', 'Jess', 'apart', 'other', 'kids', 'Then', 'Leslie', 'new', 'kid', 'outcast', 'too', 'Jess', 'Leslie', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'outcasts', 'together', 'Leslie', 'many', 'skills', 'one', 'truly', 'magical', 'overflowing', 'imagination', 'kind', 'everyone', 'let', 'Jess', 'become', 'part', 'suddenly', 'king', 'realm', 'filled', 'giants', 'winged', 'warriors', 'other', 'impossible', 'beings.It', 'Disney', 'movie', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'filled', 'cute', 'kids', 'identifiable', 'stereotypes', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'special', 'used', 'light', 'hand', 'final', 'scene', 'story', 'easy', 'kids', 'understand', 'plot', 'troubling', 'major', 'event', 'never', 'quite', 'seemed', 'recover', 'little', 'one', 'skittish', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'properly', 'prepared', 'part', 'movie.Only', 'one', 'element', 'story', 'looked', 'place', 'where', 'teacher', 'Jess', 'Saturday', 'field', 'trip', 'alone', 'sketchy', 'parental', 'knowledge', 'book', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'Maybe', 'back', 'then', 'could', 'seem', 'safe', 'encouraging', 'was', 'meant', 'look', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'naive', 'world', 'was', 'fact', 'quite', 'innocent', 'dark', 'creepy', 'appearance', 'modern', 'eyes', 'parent', 'young', 'kids', 'will', 'want', 'have', 'long', 'talk', 'movie', 'maybe', 'maybe', 'both.Still', 'enjoyable', 'flick', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'engaging', 'balance', 'fantasy', 'gritty', 'reality', 'off', 'well', 'may', 'think', 'tragic', 'defining', 'moment', 'such', 'things', 'really', 'do', 'happen', 'kids', 'have', 'deal', 'kid', 'life', 'shock', 'kind', 'might', 'be', 'value', 'knowing', 'other', 'kids', 'shocks', 'too', 'make', 'them.//wiredweird']",Bridge to Terabithia

652344,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005JPL5,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I had never read Katherine Paterson's YA novel of the same name and when I came across this DVD at my local library, I was captivated by the synopsis and decided to view it with my seven-year old daughter.The film adaptation is beautifully done, and most of the credit goes to the two young stars who play the central characters. Fifth grader Jesse (Josh Hutcherson, who was also in [[ASIN:B000DBHX4M Zathura (Special Edition)]) lives out in the country with his parents and four siblings (two older sisters who could not give him the time of day, a baby sister, and a very young Bailee Madison playing eight-year-old May Belle). Jesse's family barely scrapes by on the meager wages brought in by his dad (Robert Patrick) who works at a hardware store and also grows vegetables which he then sells to make ends meet. Jesse's relationship with his dad is tense because the older man is strict and consumed by his own financial worries. Jesse is also a loner at school, finding himself without any real friend. Jesse's only solace is his art and portfolio of drawings.Then a new family moves in next door and Jesse's entire perspective on life changes. Leslie (Anna Sophia Robb) is lovely, confident, and possessed of a sunny disposition. There's nothing that fazes this young girl, not the resident school bully, a surly eighth grader, nor anyone else who tries to ruffle her good nature. Soon Leslie befriends Jesse and the pair find they are both blessed with great imagination. The pair find their very own refuge from the outside world in a part of the woods that seems to have been forgotten by the rest of humanity. Here the pair really give free rein to their fantasy and imaginations, creating a hideaway in a magical land they nickname Terabithia.Inevitably, harsh reality intrudes in the form of tragedy, and the rest of the story focuses on how one of the main characters forges ahead despite grief and a sense of loss. This heartwarming, inspiring, and heartbreaking story makes for wonderful family entertainment.
