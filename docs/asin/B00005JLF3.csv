599926,A33L7G4E8CID3,B00005JLF3,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[6, 7]","This was the show that began the 'Government Craze' in television. The West Wing was truly original: a compelling drama, a trendsetting program, and a look into the inner workings of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue through the lives of the administration's most powerful people. That a show like this, without explosions and seldom a gunfight to be seen, could become so wildly popular is a testament to the ability of the American People to spot quality artistry. It certainly has renewed my hope in this country.The premise of the show is that the viewers would see the inner workings of the executive branch through the most powerful people working there. Martin Sheen plays the President, Jed Bartlett, a highly principled and highly educated man who is nevertheless idealistic about America. John Spencer plays his Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry, Bartlett's closest adviser and confidante. Bradley Whitford plays Josh Lyman, McGarry's deputy and occasional loose cannon. Richard Schiff plays Director of Communications Toby Ziegler, a humorless, no-nonsense administrator. In the first few seasons, his deputy was played by Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn, who often brought humor and warmth to the show. There are countless other guest stars who would contribute to this show and deeply enrich it, making a show about politics both incredibly informative and deeply character-driven.Some first season highlights include the Pilot, which introduces the characters in their element rather than just settling for lengthy exposition and has a few of the characters in trouble immediately with various groups. One need only watch the famed episode ""In Excelsis Deo"" to realize what a special show this would become. Other good shows include ""A Proportional Response"", in which the president learns the virtue of, well, proportion in foreign policy. ""Mr. Willis of Ohio"" is the story about a politician who actually makes decisions according to facts and conscience instead of polling and party lines. ""The Crackpots..."" features the first ""Big Block of Cheese Day"", which would become a kind of tradition in the show and afforded some humor as well as an examination of the fringe groups.In short, The West Wing combines entertainment with education and, for what will perhaps be the only time, doesn't compromise either ideal. No wonder it's the most respected show on television.

599940,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JLF3,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 6]","Premiering in September 1999, the original NBC series West Wing built an instant cult following with its seemingly realistic weekly excursions into the inner sanctums of the White House. The series became such a hit that some pollsters claimed that certain people actually believed Jed Bartlet was the real president (although, if true, this is more of a negative reflection on the intelligence of the electorate, and not necessarily an indication of West Wing's realism). But regardless, the truth of the matter is that West Wing definitely strikes a chord with certain audiences, providing entertaining brew of action, suspense, and drama on a weekly basis...Seasoned Hollywood actor Martin Sheen plays the lead role of President Jed Bartlet. The day-to-day affairs of Bartlet's administration are run by a number of individuals who surround him, among them are: Claudia ""C.J."" Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), and Charlie Young (Dule Hill). West Wing follows these dedicated staffers as they work extended hours behind-the-scenes to help keep the White House running smoothly. Along the way, the stress of the job and the characters' personal lives make for an interesting glimpse into what many believe is an accurate portrayal of a real-life White House administration...The West Wing (Season 1) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the series premiere in which we meet each of the recurring characters for the first time. The White House has their daily routine interrupted when President Bartlet falls off his bike, and Sam realizes the girl he picked in a bar the previous evening was a high-priced prostitute. Meanwhile, several members of the administration become embroiled in an ongoing feud with the ""religious right,"" prompting President Bartlet to personally condemn a group of fundamentalists known as ""The Lambs of God""... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Crackpots and These Women"" in which administration staffers spend their day listening to a number of crackpot, single-issue groups lobbying for federal favors, and ""Take This Sabbath Day"" in which President Bartlet grapples with the decision to commute the death sentence of a convicted killer following a Supreme Court ruling upholding his sentence...Below is a list of episodes included on the West Wing (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Pilot)Episode 2 (Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc)Episode 3 (A Proportional Response)Episode 4 (Five Votes Down)Episode 5 (The Crackpots and These Women)Episode 6 (Mr. Willis of Ohio)Episode 7 (The State Dinner)Episode 8 (Enemies)Episode 9 (The Short List)Episode 10 (In Excelsis Deo)Episode 11 (Lord John Marbury)Episode 12 (He Shall, from Time to Time)Episode 13 (Take Out the Trash Day)Episode 14 (Take This Sabbath Day)Episode 15 (Celestial Navigation)Episode 16 (20 Hours in L.A.)Episode 17 (The White House Pro-Am)Episode 18 (Six Meetings Before Lunch)Episode 19 (Let Bartlet Be Bartlet)Episode 20 (Mandatory Minimums)Episode 21 (Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics)Episode 22 (What Kind of Day Has It Been?)The DVD Report",5,A fascinating series...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,3159,"['Premiering', 'September', '1999', 'original', 'NBC', 'series', 'West', 'Wing', 'built', 'instant', 'cult', 'following', 'seemingly', 'realistic', 'weekly', 'excursions', 'inner', 'sanctums', 'White', 'House', 'series', 'became', 'such', 'hit', 'pollsters', 'claimed', 'certain', 'people', 'actually', 'believed', 'Jed', 'Bartlet', 'was', 'real', 'president', 'true', 'more', 'negative', 'reflection', 'intelligence', 'electorate', 'not', 'necessarily', 'indication', 'West', 'Wing', 'realism', 'regardless', 'truth', 'matter', 'West', 'Wing', 'definitely', 'chord', 'certain', 'audiences', 'providing', 'entertaining', 'brew', 'action', 'suspense', 'drama', 'weekly', 'basis', 'Seasoned', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'lead', 'role', 'President', 'Jed', 'Bartlet', 'day-to-day', 'affairs', 'Bartlet', 'administration', 'are', 'run', 'number', 'individuals', 'who', 'surround', 'are', 'Claudia', 'C.J', 'Cregg', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Sam', 'Seaborn', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Toby', 'Ziegler', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'Leo', 'McGarry', 'John', 'Spencer', 'Charlie', 'Young', 'Dule', 'Hill', 'West', 'Wing', 'dedicated', 'staffers', 'work', 'extended', 'hours', 'behind-the-scenes', 'help', 'keep', 'White', 'House', 'running', 'smoothly', 'way', 'stress', 'job', 'characters', 'personal', 'lives', 'make', 'interesting', 'glimpse', 'what', 'many', 'believe', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'real-life', 'White', 'House', 'administration', 'West', 'Wing', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'including', 'series', 'premiere', 'meet', 'recurring', 'characters', 'first', 'time', 'White', 'House', 'daily', 'routine', 'interrupted', 'when', 'President', 'Bartlet', 'bike', 'Sam', 'girl', 'picked', 'bar', 'previous', 'evening', 'was', 'high-priced', 'prostitute', 'Meanwhile', 'several', 'members', 'administration', 'become', 'embroiled', 'ongoing', 'feud', 'religious', 'right', 'prompting', 'President', 'Bartlet', 'personally', 'condemn', 'group', 'fundamentalists', 'known', 'Lambs', 'God', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Crackpots', 'Women', 'administration', 'staffers', 'spend', 'day', 'listening', 'number', 'crackpot', 'single-issue', 'groups', 'lobbying', 'federal', 'favors', 'Take', 'Sabbath', 'Day', 'President', 'Bartlet', 'decision', 'commute', 'death', 'sentence', 'convicted', 'killer', 'following', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'ruling', 'upholding', 'sentence', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'West', 'Wing', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Pilot', 'Episode', '2', 'Post', 'Hoc', 'Ergo', 'Propter', 'Hoc', 'Episode', '3', 'Proportional', 'Response', 'Episode', '4', 'Five', 'Votes', 'Down', 'Episode', '5', 'Crackpots', 'Women', 'Episode', '6', 'Mr.', 'Willis', 'Ohio', 'Episode', '7', 'State', 'Dinner', 'Episode', '8', 'Enemies', 'Episode', '9', 'Short', 'List', 'Episode', '10', 'Excelsis', 'Deo', 'Episode', '11', 'Lord', 'John', 'Marbury', 'Episode', '12', 'Shall', 'Time', 'Time', 'Episode', '13', 'Take', 'Out', 'Trash', 'Day', 'Episode', '14', 'Take', 'Sabbath', 'Day', 'Episode', '15', 'Celestial', 'Navigation', 'Episode', '16', '20', 'Hours', 'L.A.', 'Episode', '17', 'White', 'House', 'Pro-Am', 'Episode', '18', 'Six', 'Meetings', 'Lunch', 'Episode', '19', 'Let', 'Bartlet', 'Be', 'Bartlet', 'Episode', '20', 'Mandatory', 'Minimums', 'Episode', '21', 'Lies', 'Damn', 'Lies', 'Statistics', 'Episode', '22', 'What', 'Kind', 'Day', 'Has', 'Been', 'DVD', 'Report']",The West Wing: Season 1

599949,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00005JLF3,C. Middleton,"[5, 6]","It has now become television legend that when the creator of The West Wing, Aaron Sorkin, pitched his idea about a show concerning American politics to the executives, he was almost laughed out of their offices. Absolutely no average American TV viewer would have an interest or the intellectual capacity to appreciate a series that expounds on political policy and the political machinations behind the scenes in the nation's capitol. A show about the president? Please, the American people have had enough ""real life"" drama during the impeachment of president Clinton concerning his deceptions about his sexual exploits in the oval office. Well, these savvy television executives were dead wrong. At the end of its first season, The West Wing won more awards and was the most watched debut television series in memorable history, continuing to produce many more seasons.This series set a new benchmark for television drama. All said and done, however, this wonderful series is not about ""real"" American politics and their politicians; The West Wing is about how we would want our politicians to be - smart, ethical and human. This show is about wish fulfilment. President Bartlet may not be everyone's idea of a perfect president, but he certainly comes close. He is a Noble Prize winning economist and a politician with a family tradition that extends back the signing of the Declaration of Independence. He is ""presidential"", commanding respect, and is much too honest for his own good. Bartlet has surrounded himself with an exceedingly intelligent and loyal staff. These people bleed for him every day and would certainly die for the man. But the entire cast is strong, each character unique, contributing to the magical mix that makes this show so dynamic and personal to the audience.The first season hits the ground running building momentum until its final episode, leaving the audience hanging and chomping at the bit for more.Aaron Sorkin is an exceptionally talented writer and informed about world affairs, issues and American politics in general. I was astounded at one episode where two characters are discussing civil rights and possible monetary reparations for the great grandchildren of African American slaves. The amount worked out to be in the trillions of dollars. This discussion was simply an education and opened my eyes to this issue. Sorkin is a first class writer with a scary talent.The West Wing Season 1 includes 22 episodes with extras of interviews with the crew and cast.

599952,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JLF3,Craig MACKINNON,"[10, 12]","The West Wing has deservedly won a number of Emmy awards over the past few years - to the actors and as best drama.  Compared to shows of similar popularity, only Law and Order and ER can consistently boast the same levels of performance.  But both of these shows are becoming stale - there are only so many ways to commit a crime and so many different patient problems to fix.  On the other hand, the West Wing can be about anything since the President and government of a country will be involved in all aspects of that country's affairs.In the first season we cover some of the standard ground that a president is likely to cover.  We have a war between India and Pakistan (two countries that are putatively allies of the U.S.), selection and confirmation of a new supreme court judge, discussion on whether to pardon a man sentenced to death, a hurricane, a couple scandals, and the passage of various laws.  However, what happens is not so important as how it happens.  We get an inside look at wheeling-and-dealing between the parties in Congress (and between Congress and the White House), arguments between staffers on the best way to implement policy, and the agony of a president forced to order troops into harm's way.  It doesn't hurt that the dialogue is often very funny, the political arguments are impassioned, and the characters are lovable.The pilot is the first show on the disc, and the characters are almost fully formed.  The feel of the show - quick cuts, walking-and talking, constant bustle in the background of scenes - give the show a hyperkinetic energy that is surprising if you consider that most of what happens is dialogue.  The employment of several former White House staffers give the show a feel of authenticity (it's no surprise that Allison Chaney's performance as press secretary C.J. is the lynchpin holding the show together, as Bill Clinton's press secretary is one of these consultants).The first few episodes are a letdown compared to the pilot.  There are some growing pains and the show moves a little more slowly, which robs it of its momentum.  Likewise, characterisations sometimes go off-character (Sam the socialist and Josh the pragmatist seem to switch philosophies in one episode).  It's not really until Episode 9 (The Short List) that the series settles down and becomes regularly interesting every show.  A second early problem is that the writers weren't always sure what to do with its female cast - the First Lady, Mandy the spin doctor, and some of the female guest stars are not well-written or interesting characters.  This also irons itself out by having C.J. and Donna rise in prominence while dropping Mandi after this season.The show itself is worth having on DVD, because it is a single continuing storyline and it gives you new appreciation to see the shows close together.  That's good, because the DVD extras are not very interesting or useful.  The possibilities for extras on a show like this are endless - why not a commentary by a retired judge on the process of appointing a judge?  Why not an article comparing the Clinton White House to the one in the show?  Why not a Republican commentator to offer an alternative policy point of view to the Left-leaning Democratic president of the show?  Why not poli-sci profs or ex-Congressmen talking about the political process?  No, instead we get multiple narcissistic featurettes and commentaries on designing the style of the show, on how wonderful creators Sorkin and Schlamme are, and how much fun it is for the actors.  One such featurette was fun.  4 of them, along with 3 commentaries, was tedious.  That said, it was nice to see some cut scenes and to put a face to some of the behind-the-scenes people (especially the creators and the composer).",4,The best drama on network TV - now commercial free!,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,3775,"['West', 'Wing', 'deservedly', 'won', 'number', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'actors', 'best', 'drama', 'Compared', 'shows', 'similar', 'popularity', 'only', 'Law', 'Order', 'ER', 'can', 'consistently', 'boast', 'same', 'levels', 'performance', 'shows', 'are', 'becoming', 'stale', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'commit', 'crime', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'patient', 'problems', 'fix', 'other', 'hand', 'West', 'Wing', 'can', 'be', 'anything', 'President', 'government', 'country', 'will', 'be', 'involved', 'aspects', 'country', 'first', 'season', 'cover', 'standard', 'ground', 'president', 'likely', 'cover', 'have', 'war', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'two', 'countries', 'are', 'putatively', 'allies', 'U.S.', 'selection', 'confirmation', 'new', 'supreme', 'court', 'judge', 'discussion', 'pardon', 'man', 'sentenced', 'death', 'hurricane', 'couple', 'scandals', 'passage', 'various', 'laws', 'However', 'what', 'not', 'so', 'important', 'how', 'get', 'inside', 'look', 'wheeling-and-dealing', 'parties', 'Congress', 'Congress', 'White', 'House', 'arguments', 'staffers', 'best', 'way', 'implement', 'policy', 'agony', 'president', 'forced', 'order', 'troops', 'harm', 'way', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'dialogue', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'political', 'arguments', 'are', 'impassioned', 'characters', 'are', 'lovable.The', 'pilot', 'first', 'show', 'disc', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'fully', 'formed', 'feel', 'show', 'quick', 'cuts', 'walking-and', 'talking', 'constant', 'bustle', 'background', 'scenes', 'give', 'show', 'hyperkinetic', 'energy', 'surprising', 'consider', 'most', 'what', 'dialogue', 'employment', 'several', 'former', 'White', 'House', 'staffers', 'give', 'show', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'surprise', 'Allison', 'Chaney', 'performance', 'press', 'secretary', 'C.J', 'lynchpin', 'holding', 'show', 'together', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'press', 'secretary', 'one', 'consultants', '.The', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'letdown', 'compared', 'pilot', 'are', 'growing', 'pains', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'slowly', 'robs', 'momentum', 'Likewise', 'characterisations', 'sometimes', 'go', 'off-character', 'Sam', 'socialist', 'Josh', 'pragmatist', 'seem', 'switch', 'philosophies', 'one', 'episode', 'not', 'really', 'Episode', '9', 'Short', 'List', 'series', 'down', 'regularly', 'interesting', 'show', 'second', 'early', 'problem', 'writers', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'female', 'cast', 'First', 'Lady', 'Mandy', 'spin', 'doctor', 'female', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'not', 'well-written', 'interesting', 'characters', 'also', 'out', 'having', 'C.J', 'Donna', 'rise', 'prominence', 'dropping', 'Mandi', 'season.The', 'show', 'worth', 'having', 'DVD', 'single', 'continuing', 'storyline', 'new', 'appreciation', 'see', 'shows', 'close', 'together', 'good', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'useful', 'possibilities', 'extras', 'show', 'are', 'endless', 'why', 'not', 'commentary', 'retired', 'judge', 'process', 'appointing', 'judge', 'Why', 'not', 'article', 'comparing', 'Clinton', 'White', 'House', 'one', 'show', 'Why', 'not', 'Republican', 'commentator', 'offer', 'alternative', 'policy', 'point', 'view', 'Left-leaning', 'Democratic', 'president', 'show', 'Why', 'not', 'poli-sci', 'profs', 'ex-Congressmen', 'talking', 'political', 'process', 'No', 'instead', 'get', 'multiple', 'narcissistic', 'featurettes', 'commentaries', 'designing', 'style', 'show', 'how', 'wonderful', 'creators', 'Sorkin', 'Schlamme', 'are', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'actors', 'One', 'such', 'featurette', 'was', 'fun', '4', '3', 'commentaries', 'was', 'tedious', 'said', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'cut', 'scenes', 'put', 'face', 'behind-the-scenes', 'people', 'especially', 'creators', 'composer']",The West Wing: Season 1

599956,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B00005JLF3,David Von Pein,"[7, 7]","I, like many other people, am very glad Aaron Sorkin created ""The West Wing"". Seasons 1 through 4 of the series (written by Mr. Sorkin) represent, in my view, the best drama program on commercial television since ...... umm ...... give me a few months and I might be able to come up with something (but it won't be an easy assignment).It would be extremely difficult indeed to come up with a TV series that had a rookie season as spectacular as ""The West Wing"". Each and every one of the 22 first-season episodes located on this 4-Disc DVD collection is truly memorable. Not a bad apple in the bunch, in my opinion -- which is remarkable for any series that was just getting its feet wet.This tremendous batch of programs includes ""Five Votes Down"", ""Enemies"", ""In Excelsis Deo"", ""A Proportional Response"", and ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet"". These episodes, and all the others in this 1999-2000 campaign, are so darn good, I felt like re-watching each one of them two minutes after viewing them via these DVDs.The crafting of each episode is absolutely remarkable and worthy of high praise. The effort (and obvious care and precision) that goes into shooting just one scene is amazing. Take for instance one of the very first scenes ever filmed (for the Pilot; which is discussed by actor John Spencer in one of the very informative Making-Of documentary pieces contained on Disc 4 of this set) -- As Mr. Spencer explains in the featurette, the scene in question (one of those long, walking-the-White-House-corridors-while-talking-a-mile-a-minute type of scenes, a ""West Wing"" speciality) was originally written by Aaron Sorkin to be EIGHT different shots! But, instead, they filmed it as just ONE continuous ""hallway walking"" scene....and it's simply amazing.The acting on ""The West Wing"" is equal to the excellent writing of Mr. Sorkin. Every character is drawn well and realized to their full potential by the great collection of actors and actresses that were assembled for this TV series. It's very difficult (I would imagine) for ANY ""West Wing"" fan to choose his or her ""favorite"" character on this show. They're ALL favorites. They're ALL that good.We're not likely to see a TV program this well done for a long, long time. And it's a privilege now to be able to own these hall-of-fame-caliber shows on the DVD format.These episodes look and sound just fine on DVD. Video is in the originally-aired television ratio of 1.33:1. (NOTE: Season Two's DVD set goes to Widescreen, even though that season, like this first season, was also originally shown in the Full-Frame (1.33:1) ratio. Season #2, however, WAS ""composed"" through the camera lens for EITHER a Full-Frame OR a Widescreen ratio presentation. And Season 2, just like #1, looks great on DVD.)Sound comes from Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround tracks. Even though the shows are Full-Frame here, the Menus are anamorphic in nature.A very nice bundle of Special Features is served up here, including Audio Commentaries for five episodes (in which Aaron Sorkin participates). Many other bonuses are located on Disc 4. Here's a look ...........>> Two terrific behind-the-scenes Making-Of documentaries, entitled ""The Primaries"" (17 minutes long) and ""The Inauguration"" (29 minutes), which both give us interviews with many members of the cast and crew, including Mr. Sorkin and ""President Bartlet"" himself (Martin Sheen). Fabulous stuff here.>> Two other shorter featurettes are ""Capital Beat"" (8 minutes), which includes interviews with real-life political ""consultants"", who helped put a true-to-life political face on the series. And ""Sheet Music"" (6 minutes), which talks about the show's music.>> 4 Deleted Scenes (total run time of just over 5 minutes). These scenes can be accessed individually, or played back-to-back via a ""Play All"" selection.>> ""Gag Order"" -- A three-minute gag reel of bloopers and assorted oddball on-set happenings. There are a couple really funny screw-ups presented here. But this is way too short. It leaves you yearning for more. But -- it's fun while it lasts.>> ""The West Wing Suite"" -- This is a montage of some scenes from Season 1 of ""The West Wing"", with appropriate musical accompaniment. But I'm not entirely sure what purpose this bonus is supposed to serve here. It's nice, I guess, as a kind of ""trailer"" for Season One. It has a running time of just under 2 minutes.>> ""Off The Record"" -- This bonus segment (of 3.5 minutes duration) is a collection of outtakes from the four featurettes/documentaries on the DVD.>> Easter Egg -- There's a nifty little 2.5-minute ""Egg"" hidden on Disc 4 (the ""Special Features"" only disc). It highlights ""Manny: Head Of Security"", who is in charge of keeping people off the West Wing set when scenes are being filmed. This is a really fun Easter Egg, which also shows West Wing actor Richard Schiff having fun with ""Manny"" while riding around aimlessly on the studio lot in a golf cart-like vehicle. Kind of neat.You access the ""Egg"" by hitting your remote's Left Arrow key followed immediately by the Right Arrow key from any of the eight Special Features Menu choices on Disc #4. After performing this ""Left then Right Arrow"" combination you'll see a ""Star"" come on the screen. Pressing ""Enter"" or ""Play"" with the star on the Menu screen will access the ""Manny"" Easter Egg.Overall, it's a pretty satisfying batch of supplements offered up for this boxed set. But, in the end, this DVD collection would have been worth the price even if the 4th disc of bonus materials was excluded altogether. For it's the twenty-two magnificent episodes themselves that are truly the stars here.",5,One Of The Best Dramas Ever To Grace TV Screens!,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,5611,"['many', 'other',

599957,A2B1GZIRD6W646,B00005JLF3,David W. Nicholas,"[3, 3]","OK, let me start this out with some personal information. I'm a generally conservative Republican. The conservatism is more economic and financial than it is moral (I tend to be more libertarian on social issues). So, when it comes to the political aspect of things, I like the West Wing (which I at times sarcastically referred to as the Left Wing) more in spite of the politics than because of them.Having said that, the series is wonderfully written. The dialog is sparkling, the plot twists are at times wonderful, amusing, and fun. The characters are well-drawn, intelligent, and the whole thing is as good as television's ever gotten. The series deals with various issues that the creative minds are interested in, and they make those issues interesting and present both sides of things more than you would expect. Though the writers usually take the liberal position, they're actually honest enough to present the opposite side of each of the arguments, and let the issues be argued back and forth. The episodes often don't resolve things, completely or at all. After the middle of the season the president gets more successful, though the assassination attempt at the end of the first season sidetracks the characters somewhat.I enjoyed this series a great deal, and this first season has some of its best moments.

It's intelligent, beyond any other show that I've recently seen, and the breadth and depth of topic examination remains relevant for our society today. The characters appeal to a broad audience, but each has his/her own eccentricities that makes the show interesting, and emotional.From another angle, I've learned a significant amount about the ""behind the scenes"" political negotiation process, and the level of issue examination makes this a great conversation starter, and catalyst in really thinking about tough and fascinating issues, facing not just the US, but the world.Fantastic set so far-don't miss this show, under any circumstances!",5,One of the best shows I've ever seen-a lesson in more ways than one,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,1224,"['show', 'started', 'year', 'graduated', 'college', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'time', 'recently', 'purchased', 'entire', 'series', ""'ve"", 'always', 'known', 'would', 'appeal', 'am', 'season', '2', 'will', 'rate', 'season', 'turn', 'watch', 'them.This', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'television', 'ever', 'created', 'Not', 'only', 'fast', 'pace', 'show', 'complex', 'story', 'lines', 'intertwining', 'characters', 'lend', 'quick', 'meaningful', 'character', 'development', 'shows', 'many', 'political', 'topics', 'are', 'unraveled', 'provocation', 'eloquence.This', 'show', 'MUST', 'see', 'intelligent', 'other', 'show', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'seen', 'breadth', 'depth', 'topic', 'examination', 'relevant', 'society', 'today', 'characters', 'appeal', 'broad', 'audience', 'his/her', 'own', 'eccentricities', 'show', 'interesting', 'angle', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'significant', 'amount', 'scenes', 'political', 'negotiation', 'process', 'level', 'issue', 'examination', 'great', 'conversation', 'starter', 'catalyst', 'really', 'thinking', 'tough', 'fascinating', 'issues', 'facing', 'not', 'just', 'US', 'world.Fantastic', 'set', 'so', 'far-do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'show', 'circumstances']",The West Wing: Season 1

Marvin,"[4, 5]","I never fancied myself the type of person to, after watching a television show, pump my fist in the air and use the expression ""Now that's good television"". That was before ""The West Wing"", creator Aaron Sorkin's second foray into television and the first to be billed as a straight-up drama (but don't kid yourself, there are plenty of belly laughs to go around). Like its predecessor ""Sports Night"", TWW is built on an impeccably-casted ensemble group of actors and actresses, only this time they're in The White House. Also in typical Sorkin fashion, the series thrives on fast, punchy dialogue -- complete with wonderful Dr. Suess-like speech patterns and Chayefsky-like monologues.In the first season, the drama and the stakes are never actually that high (until the cliffhanger season finale, that is), but you grow to believe they are as the staff works its way through various obstacles (from nominating a Supreme Court Justice to working past an information leak regarding the Chief of Staff's stint in drug rehab), sometimes triumphant and sometimes failing miserably. The fact that every little thing the staff does is so nationally scrutinized is the brilliance behind the show that can make the issue of passing one small piece of legislation into a what seems like national crisis.The first season includes remarkable guest appearances, including Stockard Channing (who later becomes a regular), CSI's Jorja Fox, Edward James Olmos, hearing-impaired Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin (in a sexy recurring role), Karl Malden, and several bit parts for actors any ""Sports Night"" nut will surely recognize.This Region 1 DVD release, which is being produced on 4 double-sided DVD-18 discs (in similar fashion to Warner's August 26th ER season 1 release), will surely be worth the wait for North Americans who chose not to order from the UK (since they've had theirs for about a year now), as this edition is set to include a host of special features not found on the R2 release. The greatest of these features is sure to be the commentary on select episodes from Aaron Sorkin (who wrote all 85 episodes of the series before his departure at the end of the fourth season) and producer/director Tommy Schlamme. I, personally, am also looking forward to the documentaries, gag reels, and deleted scenes.I generally regard the last 10 to 15 minutes of each episode as some of the best television ever written, produced and acted.

So I read many reviews and decided the ""West Wing"" was worth purchasing.  I loved the emphasis on the President's daughter so that the viewer could get a feel for how the Presidential family is impacted by the Presidency.  Also, Rob Lowe was such a refreshing part of the mix that I really missed him when he left.  The fact that the Republican female character who resided in the basement in the White House kept getting replaced made the show a little choppy for me, especially the character from the Deep South, who was intelligent, witty and a great asset to the show.Through about Season 4, I was pretty fascinated and pleased with the series.  So I purchased the remaining DVD sets of ""The West Wing."" Unfortunately after Season 4, I realized I was burnt out and had gotten tired of the constantly clipped language of the players and bored with the show in general.

On the strength of that somewhat limited evidence of liking the show, I recently (on an educated whim)took the plunge and purchased ALL of the individual seasons when they were (all) ""on sale"" at Amazon.com.!Am I glad I did! I am completely hooked! Over the last few months I have devoured the first 4 seasons, and can't wait to complete the journey...and then start over again. It is THAT GOOD!It will be great to re-watch the entire run of the show, because the dialogue is often quick and poignant, and it really is a challenge to pick up on everything said on the first go-round. Also, what attention to detail set-wise and situation-wise...authenticity abounds! Why not? Dee Dee Myers being a consultant for the production, and all. If a former White House Press Secretary doesn't know the score, who does?!This show has a truly ""blast cast""...and the character development, sometimes via flashbacks, is so rich. It is the acting and interacting of the stars that make this show go.Get to know these people at the West Wing stage...their strengths, as well as their vulnerabilities. If Martin Sheen isn't our absolute greatest all-time actor, he's in the top few! He IS President Bartlet! John Spencer as Leo....Awesome! Tobey, Josh, Charlie, Donna, Margaret, Sam, etc., etc.. Stockard Channing makes a great First-Lady, and the ""occasional players"" each bring their own magic to the episodes where they are featured.There is little I can say that hasn't been said before about this masterful body of work. It's intelligent, clever, touching, humorous, poignant....brilliant! The actors are superb across the board, and the writing/acting are so carefully ""character-consistent"". Completely convincing that the roles they portray are NOT roles, but the actual people involved. That's the truest mark of GREAT acting.While this review is technically positioned as describing the First Season, it really applies to the first 4 seasons I have seen thus far(and very very likely the entire run of the show). Great ""extra"" features (though not too many)...and consistently sensational episodes. I would say that Season I is probably my favorite...but they are all gems. Not a single episode was ""phoned in"".I have noticed a few ""glitches"" in the discs...I think one episode had a moment when the picture ""froze"" momentarily, and on the Sony Blu-Ray player I have the ""prequels"" to the episodes at hand...""previously on ""The West Wing""...tend to be shown in a condensed screen image....recovering to ""full size"" image when the actual episode starts. Kind of strange, and I don't know if that's an oddity of my player or done intentionally(or accidentally) by the producers of the DVD's. The sound is awesome, the picture quality great (on the first 4 seasons which I've viewed). I've read other reviews commenting on disc ""issues""/""glitches"". Speaking only for my own experience, and the individual seasons I have purchased and enjoyed, I'd say the technical difficulties have been few...and a small inconvenience for the thrills of this landmark television experience!

They rise to the occasion, sometimes falling to the floor, picking themselves up with as much dignity as possible and getting on with the business at hand. The directing is tight and clean, the camerawork superb, even if a little rapid as characters plunge through the White House West Wing.And the acting! Every character is superbly cast, the interactions are as convincing as is possible in a staccato action drama, and the liberal (politically) slant to the story is consistent with many American Administrations. The entire &#34;feel&#34; of the first series is that this is as close as it gets to the reality of the high-pressure existence of staff in the West Wing.My fiscally-conservative socially-liberal Republican philosophy rejects some of the positions of the depicted Administration. But the brilliance of the series is far too great to allow that minor clash to diminish the enjoyment I get from watching the denizens of the West Wing dance through the waltz of infinite themes that rise to the highest levels of government, occasionally stumbling over their personal weaknesses, but generally showing compassion, intelligence, humanity and astuteness.I heartily recommend spending the time to work through the series, at your own pace. I'll wager that few who do will regret the experience.

Sorkin's President Bartlet likes to drive his staff crazy with inane trivia and the dialogue is witty, smart and clever (3 words that mean the same thing, but you'll get it if you watch).The bonus features and commentaires are stellar (have you found the easter egg? I have). There are some similarities to &quot;The American President&quot; and one episode has the same title as a Sports Night episode, but all is forgiven because Sorkin really seems to have his finger on the pulse of DC.

600021,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLF3,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[25, 29]","Watching the first season of &quot;The West Wing&quot; again from the perspective of fifth it is interesting to reconsider how the show began, especially now that creator Aaron Sorkin is gone.  When watching the pilot episode you have to remember that originally that President Jed Bartlett (Martin Sheen) was going to be a minor, recurring character, and that the series was really going to be about the staff in the West Wing: the authoritative Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry (John Spenser), the wunderkind Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), the cranky Communications Director Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), debonair Deupty Communications Director Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), and Press Secretary C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney).  However, getting Martin Sheen to play the President was just too good of an actor in too good of a role to ignore, and &quot;The West Wing&quot; became something else.One of the best ways of noting how the series took off in a direction that was not originally anticipated would be to note how Public Relations Consultant Mandy Hampton (Moira Kelly) never became part of the family, while the role Donna Moss (Janel Moloney) became increasingly more significance, and she was added to the main cast for Season 2.  That was mainly because of her comic relationship with Josh Lyman, although I have to add that Marlee Matlin as Joey Lucas was a much better fit for the group as well.  Ironically, the Josh and Donna tag-team combined with the additon of Charlie Young (Dul&eacute; Hill) as the personal aide to the President, derailed the idea that Josh was the son that Jed Barlette never had (the idea was to bring a person of color into the mix of the main cast).  The President refers to Josh as his son in the second season in his rant to God at the National Cathedral after the death of Mrs. Landingham (Kathryn Joosten), but clearly Charlie assumes that role, even without taking into account his dating Zoey Barlett (Elizabeth Moss).All of this underscores the fact that the supporting cast is as good as the main roles.  Not only Donna and Mrs. Landingham that first season, but John Amos as Admiral Fitzwallace, Timothy Busfield as Danny Concannon, Roger Rees as Lord John Marbury, Tim Matheson as Vice President John Hoynes, and, of course, Stockard Channing as as First Lady Abbey Bartlet M.D.  That is without starting to check off the impressive list of guest stars like Karl Malden, Ken Howard, Edward James Olmos, and CHH Pounder.The biggest flaw in the first season is the idea that the Vice President would be so out of the loop.  Even with the history lesson of the animosity that existed between JFK and LBJ, no New England intellectual elected to the White House is going to waste having a powerful former Senator from Texas in his administration.  Every since Jimmy Carter thoroughly vetted the cream of the Democratic party for his Vice President it has been an imperative that the spot be picked by somebody qualified to be president from day one, and other that Dan Quayle that has certainly been the case.  Gary Cole is a nice addition to the supporting cast, but Bartlett being 0 for 2 on Veeps is not a good thing.That is why the idea this season that the Republicans would force some junior Congressman into the position is so offensive.  The key historical precedent would be the selection of Nelson Rockerfeller: qualified to be President and approved with the caveat this would be his final government job (i.e., he would not be on the ticket when Ford ran in 1976).  But if the show was intended to not be about the President but his staff, then the Vice President is a minor concern.  So it is interesting to be revisiting that idea this fifth season, just as it is watching Josh get into and out of the doghouse the same way C.J. does in a minor story arc in the first season.Best Moments from Season One:  the first appearance of the President, quoting the First Commandment in the &quot;Pilot,&quot; Danny bringing C.J. a goldfish on the advice of Josh, Charlie coming to Zoey's defense in &quot;Mr. Willis of Ohio,&quot; the President getting a gift from the one Cabinet Secretary who will not be attending the State of the Union address in &quot;He Shall, From Time to Time...&quot;, and the prophetic father's worst nightmare that Bartlett lays out for Zoey in &quot;Six Meetings Before Lunch&quot; (which also has the classic fight between Sam and Mallory on school vouchers).Final Thought: It would be interesting if when Barlett's second is up if the show continued with a Republican Administration.  It will not happen, but it would certainly be interesting.",5,Aaron Sorkin turns the Presidency into a weekly TV series,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,4639,"['Watching', 'first', 'season', 'quot',

600031,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JLF3,Mark Baker,"[5, 11]","Season one of The West Wing opens part way through the first year of the Bartlet Administration.  President Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) is a first term Democrat from New England, and he has a strong staff helping him.  That is, when they aren't caught up in personal issues.  For instance, Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn's (Rob Lowe) new friend happens to be a prostitute.  Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer) is having problems in his marriage.  And Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford) is upset that they have hired former girlfriend Mandy Hampton (Moira Kelly) as a political consultant.  Never mind the fact that she is the best in the business.But along with the personal drama, there are also plenty of politics as The White House seeks to get various bills through Congress, or even a Supreme Court Nominee.  Fortunately, CJ Cregg (Allison Janney) is on hand to properly deal with the press during all the ups and downs of the first year.I know this show was popular when it aired, but I never even tried to get into it.  In fact, I only watched this season because my best friend passed it on to me.  The pilot confirmed my worst fears as conservative Christians come out of that looking like complete hypocrites.  But I pressed on.  Even from there, the show was a mixed bag.I must admit, I have grown to love these characters, especially President Bartlet.  The one exception is Mandy, who is just too sanctimonious for her own good.  On the other hand, the conversations that Josh has with his assistant, Donna Moss (Janel Moloney), are often the highlights of the episodes for me.  While the show does present a liberal agenda very favorably, it does begin to have a more balanced portrayal of conservatives as it goes along.However, the storytelling is very weak.  This is most noticeable in the first few episodes.  We are just dumped into a story and not really told who any of the players are.  I had to look them all up myself.  Multiple episodes are completely predictable, and not just because of a formula but because of cliches used too many times before elsewhere.  Several of the episodes are more a chance to preach to us then entertain us.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[8, 10]","The West Wing is a show so delicious to watch - it is difficult to imagine that there are 22 feature films made in any given year that are as well-done and entertaining to watch.It's wonderful to watch these episodes with a digital transfer and no commercials - my wife and I feel spoiled.  After watching a few hours of ""West Wing"" it feels like a real step-down to watch other network television, and it's the RARE movie that is as entertaining, thought-provoking and heart-warming.The characters in this show seem very real, and even better, they seem very fundamentally ""good"" and concerned about each other, the country and their fellow man.  Time and again the characters take a step out of ""the usual"", but never with the intention of benefitting themselves.  Although this White House is democratic, you get a sense that they consider ""all sides"".  Every so often an event happens where various characters have the opportunity to ""do the right thing"" versus ""look good"", and invariably they err on the side of ""doing the right thing"".One of the great things about this show is that it presents and ""teaches"" some of the fundamental political debates in our country in a way that is much livelier than a dry textbook or lecture.  For example, when C.J. pulls aside Sam and admits she understands basically zilch about the national census, Sam gives her a quick ""Census 101"" that make it very clear to C.J. - but also makes it clear to the audience as well.  We get to hear political debate - and although the Bartlett White House is full of liberal democrats we usually get a pretty good look at the opposite side.  Example: Donna discovers that there is a budget surplus of over 30 billion in this first season (at about the same time that the Clinton administration unexpectedly discovered the same thing). Donna thinks the taxpayers should get a refund. Josh, her boss, explains to her that democrats have a much better plan for the surplus and it just wouldn't be a democratic party kind of ""thing"" (any event or idea is a thing to these characters.)Opposing viewpoints are not ridiculed for the most part.  Although a fictional account who wouldn't feel comfortable with a team like this leading our country?Accompanying the complete first 22 episodes is a disc of ""behind the scenes"" documentaries that make it clear that the genius behind the madness is writer/creator Aaron Sorkin.Seldom does writing, directing, setting and acting come together so in a manner so completely satisfying.  Mr. Sorkin says in one of the included interviews that one of their goals is to make every episode as good as the best one.  Everyone has their ""favorites"" among the episodes - me too - but in this first season every one is excellent.",5,As good as television gets,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,2737,"['West', 'Wing', 'show', 'so', 'delicious', 'watch', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'are', '22', 'feature', 'films', 'made', 'given', 'year', 'are', 'well-done', 'entertaining', 'watch.It', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'episodes', 'digital', 'transfer', 'commercials', 'wife', 'feel', 'spoiled', 'watching', 'few', 'hours', 'West', 'Wing', 'real', 'step-down', 'watch', 'other', 'network', 'television', 'RARE', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', 'heart-warming.The', 'characters', 'show', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'even', 'better', 'seem', 'very', 'fundamentally', 'good', 'concerned', 'other', 'country', 'fellow', 'man', 'Time', 'again', 'characters', 'take', 'step', 'usual', 'never', 'intention', 'benefitting', 'White', 'House', 'democratic', 'get', 'sense', 'consider', 'sides', 'Every', 'so', 'often', 'event', 'where', 'various', 'characters', 'have', 'opportunity', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'versus', 'look', 'good', 'invariably', 'err', 'side', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', '.One', 'great', 'things', 'show', 'teaches', 'fundamental', 'political', 'debates', 'country', 'way', 'much', 'livelier', 'dry', 'textbook', 'lecture', 'example', 'when', 'C.J', 'pulls', 'aside', 'Sam', 'basically', 'zilch', 'national', 'census', 'Sam', 'quick', 'Census', '101', 'make', 'very', 'clear', 'C.J', 'also', 'clear', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'hear', 'political', 'debate', 'Bartlett', 'White', 'House', 'full', 'liberal', 'democrats', 'usually', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'look', 'opposite', 'side', 'Example', 'Donna', 'budget', 'surplus', '30', 'billion', 'first', 'season', 'same', 'time', 'Clinton', 'administration', 'unexpectedly', 'discovered', 'same', 'thing', 'Donna', 'taxpayers', 'should', 'get', 'refund', 'Josh', 'boss', 'democrats', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'plan', 'surplus', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'democratic', 'party', 'kind', 'thing', 'event', 'idea', 'thing', 'characters', 'Opposing', 'viewpoints', 'are', 'not', 'ridiculed', 'most', 'part', 'fictional', 'account', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comfortable', 'team', 'leading', 'country', 'Accompanying', 'complete', 'first', '22', 'episodes', 'disc', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'make', 'clear', 'genius', 'madness', 'writer/creator', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin.Seldom', 'writing', 'directing', 'setting', 'acting', 'come', 'together', 'so', 'manner', 'so', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'Mr.', 'Sorkin', 'one', 'included', 'interviews', 'one', 'goals', 'make', 'episode', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'one', 'Everyone', 'favorites', 'episodes', 'too', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'excellent']",The West Wing: Season 1

Being more of a music than a film person, I'm saddened by the increasing use of ""compression"" (in the audio engineer's sense--I don't mean JPEG or MP3 compression) in music.  It makes CDs sound better in car stereos and on portable players.  But for listening on a good hi-fi at home, much of the music's drama is lost if there isn't much difference between the quietest and the loudest passages.One of my favorite things about West Wing has been that it's unusually cinematic for a television series.  It isn't bright and day-glo.  Unlike most TV shows, which more and more seem to be converging with the techniques of television advertisements.So, yes:  great cinematography.  But it was Sorkin's scripting which was crucial.  His ability to weave multiple subplots both within a show and from show-to-show remains unmatched by any other writer for television.  Some may object that what I've described is merely the ""soap opera"" formula:  but what soap opera ever had this kind of substance or emotional impact?[SPOILER alert -- covering the next two paragraphs]Think of the show where Josh is on stage narrating ""a day in the life"" at the White House:  the time he filled in at a press conference after C.J. had an emergency root canal and could barely speak.  Josh jokingly told the press corps that the President had a ""secret"" plan to fight inflation, and the reporters all take him seriously!  His verbal performance is cut in not only with shots from that past fiasco -- but also merges with the developing story -- which Josh follows via his cell phone, occasionally interrupting his talk -- that story taking place in parallel, in the present, where a teetotaling Supreme Court nominee is arrested on a groundless DWI charge, which was in fact the crime of ""driving-while-Hispanic"" in what must have been a very-white Connecticut town.If only the judge had followed through with his initial intention to stay in prison, not only so that he can see the justice system from the other side, but presumably also develop a better cause of action to sue the racist cops who arrested him.  Yes, the plot might have slowed down too much...but what a spectacle it would have been.[OK, this is where you can start reading again, if you didn't want to hear too much]Most television producers imagine the audience can't possibly keep track of so many characters and plotlines.  Especially not timelines!  The success of West Wing has proven them s-o-o-o wrong.I suppose it's too much to ask.  To expect that kind of brilliant writing to appear on TV again.But we can always watch the Sorkin seasons on DVD.

I was about one year out of high school and really interested in the prospects of a screenwriting career.For anybody who attends any sort of seminar, there is usually a certain film, script or work that an instructor uses to demonstrate the points of a successful story and/ or film. The script Michael Hauge had chosen was ""The American President,"" written by Aaron Sorkin.I had no idea at the time of the calibur of storytelling I had in my instruction manual. I knew I liked the movie, but I didn't know why until the seminar had concluded and the film had been dissected to its core. I went on to learn that Aaron Sorkin had also written ""A Few Good Men.""Those two screenplays alone are an education, brilliantly crafted, riveting in both plot and in the dilemmas and conflict of character, but the stamp of Aaron Sorkin's style comes in his use of dialogue. There are few other writers capable of crafting the intelligence, heart and wit that gets fired out of the mouths of Hollywood's most gifted actors.West Wing provides time to focus on issues, life and love in a way no feature film can and each season leaves you wanting more. Aaron Sorkin was able to take one simple idea of a behind the scenes look at Senior Staffers in the White House and turn it into an extraordinary hour of television year after year. Due credit should be given to John Wells, Tommy Schlamme and other contributors who helped make the West Wing come alive and to the actors for giving those people heart as well as wicked tongues.

I started watching this again on Amazon Prime because my best friend had never seen the show, and I had a feeling she would like it. She did! This show is super fast-paced, and it is absolutely hilarious in sarcasm, irony and subtly. You have to pay attention, because it blows over the jokes fast, but there is a lot of humor in this drama. I'm not a political person, and you really don't have to be politically savvy to enjoy the show--in fact, someone who is really into politics might not really like the show as much. It does require people to not take things too seriously to watch it for the entertainment value. It's also sort of neat to go back in time to see the 'headline' crises going on in the world when the show originally aired.Definitely worth watching or re-watching again... I'm planning to slowly go through all the episodes, catching up on some that I missed first time around. Enjoying the series quite a bit.In this second episode of the first season, we get to know the main characters a bit more, diving deeper into their interworkings, friendships and associations, learning who is on whose side, who works for whom, and more. The humor still stands out strong, but the serious headlines of the time are dealt with in a respectful way, without degrading it to slapstick.

I decided to give it three because it is better than so much of what has been on the main corporate media.  I also am an opponent of the militarist and exclusionary ""Christianity"" of the right-wing and share other political sentiments of the show.  Having said that, this characterization of the West Wing glorifies an executive branch (liberal and conservative administrations) that is thoroughly corrupted by big money.  This series gets liberal points for arguing for gun control and that sort of issue, but when it comes to the issues the Clinton administration was quite reactionary on - ""free"" trade deals like NAFTA, the war on non-corporate drugs, the demonization of Arabs who our empire has been targeting for generations, welfare ""reform,"" boosts in corporate welfare and privatization schemes - the show is really quiet on those issues.  Very quiet on important issues, and very heavy on the sappy patriotic music and constantly putting a portrait of Teddy Roosevelt or a bust of some other founder on the screen.I don't like that term ""founding fathers,"" on top of diminishing the role of women and the general public, it's a slap in the face to the indigenous people, and the slaves and the migrant & native workers who truly built the country.

Cop shows, Doc shows, lawyer shows--I'm on board for the first season, unless and until seeing a few episodes shows me I have better things to do with that hour. I didn't know beans about Aaron Sorkin--his name didn't resonate with me like those of Dick Wolf, Jerry Bruckheimer, Stephen Cannell. But what I was hearing about this one intrigued me. Back in 1999 I wasn't under the constant onslaught from people I know of anti-gov rhetoric which back then was still pretty much the province of militia gun nuts. And the more this ""neo-anarchism"" grew, the more defiant I got. I was supposed to watch mean-spirited sitcoms instead? And I got nowhere (and still don't today) when I said to Washington-bashing friends; ""You guys are talking about our own capitol the way people did 20 years ago about the Kremlin."" So I tuned in to this series, and when it started bagging Emmys I wasn't surprised. You get dynamite characters like Rob Lowe's Sam Seaborn, Bradley Whitford's Josh Lyman, John Spencer's Leo McGarry, Richard Schiff's Toby Zeigler, a really likable girl-next-door type like Donna Moss played by Janel Moloney, who I later found out was the woman who as a kid had played Tiny Tim's big sister Belinda on a version of ""Christmas Carol"". And avuncular Martin Sheen was cast to type as a less-sexy New England version of Bill Clinton. And as the series progressed, we saw the President Of the United States, played by the guy with the biggest matinee name, as a supporting player. It was instead like the title suggests--about the lives of those who work in the White House, down to the grandmotherly presidential receptionist. In 1999 I was becoming a disafected Democrat, who later registered as a moderate Nelson Rockefeller/ Jerry Ford Republican. And you know, I never did tune in to boo at the bleepin' Democrats the way some people do with Stone Cold Steve Austin.

I often saw it playing on TV while I was living in Toronto, Canada, but was never captivated to sit indoors and watch it (I spend most of my spare time in outdoor activities).Then one day Bush junior took office. Then came September 11, then the US invasion of Afghanistan, followed by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Then Moore's Fahrenheit 911 hit the screens to become a box office hit. Then came Bush's second term, which I did not expect he'd win, followed by the lowest approval ratings in US history. Iraq was a disaster; Afghanistan was becoming another problem as the Taliban regrouped and regained strength; and Bin Laden was still evading capture.Suddenly I found myself interested in American politics. I wanted to know more about what goes on behind the scenes. What makes a US President popular? How are decisions taken? Does the President act on his own or as a team? Can the President sleep at night when US troops and innocent civilians are dying? How does the secret Service protect the President? My questions could fill several pages. I could easily have gone on the internet and typed each question on Google. Better still, I could have gone to the Library, a trip few of us take today with the advent of the internet. But I decided to watch Season 1 of the West Wing, and am I glad I did.The West Wing will give you an inside look at the American Presidency. You will really learn a lot about American politics. Did you know, for example, that the American Eagle holds thirteen arrows in the left talon and an olive branch in the right talon? When at peace, the Eagle faces the olive branch. When at war, the Eagle faces the arrows. In the halls of Congress the carpets are actually changed to reflect this.Did you know that the Secret Service is aware at all times of the location of the President, even while he is in the White House? A Secret Service agent radios the Central Command when the President enters the Oval Office and when he leaves it. A Secret Service agent is practically positioned at every door in the White House, radioing where the President is at all times. There is little privacy for the President in the White House. Maybe being the President of the US is not as glamorous as we all think if one has to forego his privacy and freedom.Every word the President utters must be well thought off, and the consequences of the words calculated ahead of time by his team. A US President goes through rehearsals before giving speeches and before standing in front of journalists. He is always surrounded by a team of experts advising him of how he should answer questions, and which questions should not be answered. One wrong word could mean a slide in approval ratings.The Secret Service also protects the President's family. Could you imagine an unfriendly country kidnapping the President's daughter? What would the President do in such a case? Would he make the wrong decisions in order to save his daughter? Would his daughter come first, or the country? Would the President be relieved of his duties in such a situation as not to compromise US security? This series will answer a lot of these questions.This series will also show you the relationship between the President and his staff. The Vice-President is not necessarily always on the President's side, and he often has his own agenda. Sometimes he would act to his own benefit in order to gain popularity for a possible run at the Presidency. Politics can be a dirty business, and a very selfish one.I enjoyed learning about the press core in the White House, and how they retrieve news. I now watch CNN in a new light.The characters in this series are well thought off, very believable, and likable. There is one character I did not particularly like, and I think he was later replaced in other Seasons. Martin Sheen plays the President, and I don't think anyone could have played the part better.This series is exciting, with many twists. The series ends with an attempted murder at the US President and his daughter, and someone is shot, but we don't know who. You'd have to watch Series 2 to find out.If you've always wanted to learn more about the US Presidency and US politics in general, this series will be a great start.

Having never seen the show prior to this stretch, and really not following the critical acclaim for the show, I'd really never felt inspired to tackle the series until after watching and enjoying ""The Newsroom"" by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin.I'm sure that the one or two of you that happen to stumble on my review, and have bothered to continue to read it, are probably more familiar with the show than I was, and regardless of what I have to say, have or will watch it regardless.  All I can say is that it is a real kudos to NBC that they let the show be produced with such a magnificent standard of intelligence that one has to either be sharp as a tack to follow it live, or else they rewatch a recorded copy.  Nonetheless, it moves fast in it's dialog and presumes that folks will keep up.I'm currently now into Season 4.  I have no idea what's to come (other than I'd heard in advance about changes in the Presidents staff due to health and contractual issues with certain actors) but I'm thoroughly engaged in the action.  I'd also heard that Season 4 was the last for Mr. Sorkin; if the series noticeably suffers as a result, I may drop out of the series.For now, I will say that the acting and writing is absolutely terrific, the flow of the action works well, and (perhaps the greatest compliment) that the show's various stories not only arc from episodes and moments within the season, but even moments from earlier seasons.  Which means that, to follow certain story lines, you really need to watch the whole series.  I so admire that in a series.  It works on it's own terms, and expects it's audience to comply.For all of my heaps of praise, I will add that it's not perfect (thus 4 stars).  While NBC does deserve it's kudos, it remains a very idealized version of American politics.  So far anyway, it tackles some complexities but avoids others, such as the influence of money in politics and various matters of corruption.Also, President Bartlett and his staff seem like an immensely likeable and extraordinarily intelligent bunch, fast thinking and amazingly clever, it's a bit irritating that there's hardly any noticeable deviation from this characterization.  I know this is Sorkin (I see it on ""The Newsroom"" as well) but it still makes the show feel like a show... contrived.  I start with shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Breaking Bad"" as the 5-star bar, where the characters are much more complex and fully realized.  On West Wing, the characters are simply less believable as real people.So, to sum up, after 3-1/2 seasons, I'm really impressed with the groundbreaking standard of quality for West Wing as a network TV series, but for all of it's admirable qualities, it's not as great as some of the non-network TV shows I've seen.",4,Review for seasons 1-3,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2821,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'series', 'streamed', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Having', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'prior', 'stretch', 'really', 'not', 'following', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'show', ""'d"", 'really', 'never', 'felt', 'inspired', 'tackle', 'series', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'Newsroom', 'West', 'Wing', 'creator', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'two', 'happen', 'stumble', 'review', 'have', 'bothered', 'continue', 'read', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'familiar', 'show', 'was', 'regardless', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'will', 'watch', 'regardless', 'can', 'say', 'real', 'kudos', 'NBC', 'let', 'show', 'be', 'produced', 'magnificent', 'standard', 'intelligence', 'one', 'either', 'be', 'sharp', 'tack', 'follow', 'live', 'else', 'rewatch', 'recorded', 'copy', 'Nonetheless', 'fast', 'dialog', 'presumes', 'folks', 'will', 'keep', 'up.I', ""'m"", 'currently', 'now', 'Season', '4', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'come', 'other', ""'d"", 'heard', 'advance', 'changes', 'Presidents', 'staff', 'due', 'health', 'contractual', 'issues', 'certain', 'actors', ""'m"", 'thoroughly', 'engaged', 'action', ""'d"", 'also', 'heard', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'last', 'Mr.', 'Sorkin', 'series', 'noticeably', 'result', 'may', 'drop', 'series.For', 'now', 'will', 'say', 'acting', 'writing', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'flow', 'action', 'well', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'compliment', 'show', 'various', 'stories', 'not', 'only', 'arc', 'episodes', 'moments', 'season', 'even', 'moments', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Which', 'follow', 'certain', 'story', 'lines', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'so', 'admire', 'series', 'own', 'terms', 'audience', 'comply.For', 'heaps', 'praise', 'will', 'add', 'not', 'perfect', 'thus', '4', 'stars', 'NBC', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'very', 'idealized', 'version', 'American', 'politics', 'So', 'far', 'anyway', 'complexities', 'avoids', 'others', 'such', 'influence', 'money', 'politics', 'various', 'matters', 'corruption.Also', 'President', 'Bartlett', 'staff', 'seem', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'extraordinarily', 'intelligent', 'bunch', 'fast', 'thinking', 'amazingly', 'clever', 'bit', 'irritating', 'hardly', 'noticeable', 'deviation', 'characterization', 'know', 'Sorkin', 'see', 'Newsroom', 'well', 'still', 'show', 'feel', 'show', 'contrived', 'start', 'shows', 'Sopranos', 'Breaking', 'Bad', '5-star', 'bar', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'fully', 'realized', 'West', 'Wing', 'characters', 'are', 'simply', 'less', 'believable', 'real', 'people.So', 'sum', 'up', '3-1/2', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'really', 'impressed', 'groundbreaking', 'standard', 'quality', 'West', 'Wing', 'network', 'TV', 'series', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'non-network', 'TV', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen']",The West Wing: Season 1

This is fast paced and intelligent and you need to keep your attention on the events on-screen or you can quickly become lost in the story, but this is a positive element in my view. This isn't dumbed down and the audience is treated with respect throughout. Although this is stylised, it does give some idea of what life must be like in the halls of high level political decision making and it makes for fascinating and gripping viewing. Once you buy this you will want to get the rest of the series' and keep watching the various stories unfold, especially after the end of series cliff hanger. This was highly lauded for a reason and is top TV making at it's best.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",5,West Wing 1,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1414,"['West', 'Wing', 'Season', 'One', 'political', 'TV', 'series', 'made', 'intelligence', 'humour', 'gripping', 'storylines', 'Following', 'Democrat', 'president', 'team', 'senior', 'staff', 'series', 'various', 'issues', 'American', 'politics', 'world', 'affairs', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'politics', 'enjoy', 'show', 'strong', 'human', 'element', 'stories', 'background', 'knowledge', 'would', 'only', 'serve', 'heighten', 'enjoyment', 'events', 'such', 'making', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'gun', 'laws', 'privacy', 'laws', 'death', 'sentence', 'reaction', 'terrorists', 'conflict', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'just', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'fast', 'paced', 'intelligent', 'need', 'keep', 'attention', 'events', 'on-screen', 'can', 'quickly', 'become', 'lost', 'story', 'positive', 'element', 'view', ""n't"", 'dumbed', 'down', 'audience', 'treated', 'respect', 'stylised', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'halls', 'high', 'level', 'political', 'decision', 'making', 'fascinating', 'gripping', 'viewing', 'buy', 'will', 'want', 'get', 'rest', 'series', 'keep', 'watching', 'various', 'stories', 'unfold', 'especially', 'end', 'series', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'was', 'highly', 'lauded', 'reason', 'top', 'TV', 'making', 'best.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",The West Wing: Season 1

It is an hour long drama that focuses on the inner workings of the White House. The pilot finds the White House's staff still adjusting to their newly won roles: a deputy chief of staff makes a gaffe on television, the president injures himself in an accident, and most pressing, over 1000 Cuba refugees are currently making their way to Miami, Florida.  Viewers can expect similar plot lines packed into each episode.Creator Aaron Sorkin (who writes almost every episode in the first four seasons of the show) does a fantastic job keeping the drama interesting and realistic. The characters are well developed, and the dialogue is spectacular. It's hard to keep up with what it is exactly everyone does here in this first episode, but it quickly comes together in subsequent episodes. There is political rhetoric here, and while the administration featured here is Democrat, much of the sensibilities here are populist rather than partisan. Republicans won't be angered, etc... Sorkin does a great job straddling the line and giving both sides great platforms.The first season ends with a pretty massive cliff hanger that will leave viewers scrambling to watch the next season.  The ending isn't completely unexpected -- there are hints to it earlier in the season, but it is shocking nonetheless.The West Wing is essential viewing for anyone who enjoys television dramas.",5,One of the Best Television Dramas Ever,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,1483,"['West', 'Wing', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'have', 'aired', 'past', '20', 'years', 'probably', 'television', 'hour', 'long', 'drama', 'inner', 'workings', 'White', 'House', 'pilot', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'still', 'adjusting', 'newly', 'won', 'roles', 'deputy', 'chief', 'staff', 'gaffe', 'television', 'president', 'accident', 'most', 'pressing', '1000', 'Cuba', 'refugees', 'are', 'currently', 'making', 'way', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'Viewers', 'can', 'expect', 'similar', 'plot', 'lines', 'packed', 'episode.Creator', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'who', 'almost', 'episode', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'show', 'fantastic', 'job', 'keeping', 'drama', 'interesting', 'realistic', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'dialogue', 'spectacular', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'exactly', 'everyone', 'here', 'first', 'episode', 'quickly', 'together', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'political', 'rhetoric', 'here', 'administration', 'featured', 'here', 'Democrat', 'much', 'sensibilities', 'here', 'are', 'populist', 'rather', 'partisan', 'Republicans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'angered', 'etc', 'Sorkin', 'great', 'job', 'straddling', 'line', 'giving', 'sides', 'great', 'platforms.The', 'first', 'season', 'pretty', 'massive', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'will', 'leave', 'viewers', 'scrambling', 'watch', 'next', 'season', 'ending', ""n't"", 'completely', 'unexpected', 'are', 'hints', 'earlier', 'season', 'shocking', 'nonetheless.The', 'West', 'Wing', 'essential', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'television', 'dramas']",The West Wing: Season 1

I was pleasantly surprised by just how good it was.  After Aaron Sorkin left the show it seldom came close to the quality of the first few seasons.  The writing, acting, lighting and attention to detail made this show great.  Watching the first season after the first post-Sorkin season was quite a shock.  The difference in quality made it seem like a completely different show.This collection also has some great extras.  There are interviews with cast and crew and some outtakes, but the best are the episodes with commentary from Sorkin, Tommy Schlamme and some of the other directors.  Any fan of the show will enjoy this stuff.

600108,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B00005JLF3,Thayer,"[6, 8]","I have always been interested to political dramas. And ""The West Wing"", episode by episode, gives the audience those kinds of stories and more. From the witty and sarcastic  one-liners to the character driven stories, the show always delivers. It created a tapestry of characters that are individually and collectively engaging.Here are my personal top 5 favorite episodes of the season:1. In Excelsis Deo - A great episode that has a very positively Christmas feel. The White House staff had to deal with different things, CJ with her position on hate crimes, Sam and Josh protecting Leo from the drug scandal, Toby inexplicably affected by the death of a homeless man. Ironically only the president seems to be in the Christmas mood with his holiday shopping. The episode ended with a great montage with the white house staff all lined up while listening to the Christmas carol and then the funeral of the dead homeless man.2. Let Bartlet Be Bartlet - A great ensemble episode that showcased the unity and loyalty of the staff to the administration of Bartlett. It's a poignant episode that strengthens the viewers attachment and involvement to the characters. You root for them and you want them to succeed.3. Celestial Navigation - I love this episode. Probably the funniest episode of the season. There's so many great scenes like Josh being hounded in the press room, Sam and Toby in the prison, and CJ with the root canal. Nice use of flashbacks.4. What Kind of Day Has it Been? - I love this kind of style of storytelling. The episode opened with the last 5 minutes of the episode where nothing makes sense because we have no idea what happened prior to the scene. The opening scene ended with a cliffhanger. Then we get to see things that happened before the opening scene. I often see that kind of storytelling style in Alias, and I really like it. The last few minutes of the episode were suspenseful. A great season ender.5. Pilot - A solid series premiere that established the mood of the show as well as introducing the White House staff.Grade: A-",5,The West Wing: Season One,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,2061,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'political', 'dramas', 'West', 'Wing', 'episode', 'episode', 'audience', 'kinds', 'stories', 'more', 'witty', 'sarcastic', 'one-liners', 'character', 'driven', 'stories', 'show', 'always', 'created', 'tapestry', 'characters', 'are', 'individually', 'collectively', 'are', 'personal', 'top', '5', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season:1', 'Excelsis', 'Deo', 'great', 'episode', 'very', 'positively', 'Christmas', 'feel', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'had', 'deal', 'different', 'things', 'CJ', 'position', 'hate', 'crimes', 'Sam', 'Josh', 'protecting', 'Leo', 'drug', 'scandal', 'Toby', 'inexplicably', 'affected', 'death', 'homeless', 'man', 'Ironically', 'only', 'president', 'be', 'Christmas', 'mood', 'holiday', 'shopping', 'episode', 'ended', 'great', 'montage', 'white', 'house', 'staff', 'lined', 'up', 'listening', 'Christmas', 'carol', 'then', 'funeral', 'dead', 'homeless', 'man.2', 'Let', 'Bartlet', 'Be', 'Bartlet', 'great', 'ensemble', 'episode', 'showcased', 'unity', 'loyalty', 'staff', 'administration', 'Bartlett', 'poignant', 'episode', 'viewers', 'attachment', 'involvement', 'characters', 'root', 'want', 'succeed.3', 'Celestial', 'Navigation', 'love', 'episode', 'Probably', 'funniest', 'episode', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'Josh', 'being', 'hounded', 'press', 'room', 'Sam', 'Toby', 'prison', 'CJ', 'root', 'canal', 'Nice', 'use', 'flashbacks.4', 'What', 'Kind', 'Day', 'Has', 'Been', 'love', 'kind', 'style', 'storytelling', 'episode', 'opened', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'episode', 'where', 'nothing', 'sense', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'prior', 'scene', 'opening', 'scene', 'ended', 'cliffhanger', 'Then', 'get', 'see', 'things', 'happened', 'opening', 'scene', 'often', 'see', 'kind', 'storytelling', 'style', 'Alias', 'really', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'episode', 'were', 'suspenseful', 'great', 'season', 'ender.5', 'Pilot', 'solid', 'series', 'premiere', 'established', 'mood', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'introducing', 'White', 'House', 'staff.Grade', 'A-']",The West Wing: Season 1

600112,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00005JLF3,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[4, 6]","Tendentious I was when I gave this set to my spouse for Christmas. Neither of us is a TV watcher. Most of the television scripts are as if written by 11 year olds who think they're funny or romantic. We got into this series right after the first season. So we are both seeing most or all of the episodes for the first time.First, Bartlet is the way a president SHOULD be. In fact, I talked with many a Washington ""progressive"" who watched the series during Clinton's tenure wishing he'd learn from Bartlet. He's compassionate, listens to his staff--who'd give their left leg for him, and, after a while, he recognizes that. He's bright. He thinks of others outside of his own family and circle of cronies. Most of all, he struggles with the difference between morality and politics. (No, I'm not endorsing Martin Sheen for president. His is a character. He may even be a great guy in real life, probably is. Which means he'd probably be eaten alive by my neighbors in Washington!)The casting is fabulous. (I'm a little confused as to why they don't interview Rob Lowe like they do the others, unless they put together the whole set after he'd decided to leave the cast.) In fact, the one whose character is closest to the opposite of his personality is Richard Schiff (Toby). He's so bitter, even self-absorbed in the script and seems to laugh and joke around freely while off camera, somewhat like Jonathan Frakes in ""Star Trek, the Next Generation"" first season. One of my favorite lines of his occurs in the pilot when a fundamentalist preacher suggests  what would attract teens to indecent thoughts. Watch for yourself to hear Toby's response.The rest of the cast gives constant accolades to Allison Janney (CJ). I'll take their words for it. I think she's good, but the others are too.Well, Rob Lowe--while good--seems to take himself a little too seriously. I do like his stands in favor of the call girl he met in the pilot. He stands on principal rather than on what others are supposed to think of him. That's among the examples of how the stories are real-life. I mean, people do have inappropiate relationships for which they have to answer; the do have power trips. You get my drift.Oh, if you're looking for bloopers, there are some in the last disk. But fortunately, they're not overdone. (That's where I see Shiff, Sheen, and Janney break into laughter frequently.)Forgive me for not mentioning the others. You're all good, you really are.For what it's worth, my favorites are probably ""In Excelsis Deo"" and ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet,"" not necessarily in that order, with the episode dealing with the death penalty (I can't remember the title) ranking just a little behind. In fact, that death penalty episode is characteristic of the value of the scripts: the mix of humor and seriousness is pleasantly done. Most TV drama scripts are such that, if life were really that way, most of us would be suicidal or anti-depressant users. Lots of funny things do happen. They fit well into the spectacular scripts.The only thing I have against the script is that there is too much focus on the 12-step model for Leo McGarry's constant ""recovery."" That's why I only give this fabulous set 4 stars. I was inclined to speculate here why the writer, Aaron Sorkin, stressed that but I don't think Amazon.com likes it when critics do that. Suffice it to say that that model is at least controversial. One might rationalize it for dramatic effect, but it would be just as solid for Leo to say, ""Look, I used to drink too much and I did some valium.

I didn't tune in when it first started because I just couldn't picture being entertained by politics, but I was wrong. I caught a 1st season episode on Bravo one weekend (the show had probably been on the air for several seasons at that point), and I was hooked instantly. It's so smart and informative. And whether or not you're a Democrat or a Repulican etc, they make valid arguments for each political party. My favorite characters are Sam, Josh, and Toby. Although they can be arrogant at times, they're such good guys overall. I fell in love with all three of them. Anyway, my favorite episode of the entire series is in this first season--Celestial Navigation. It's so funny how badly Josh mucks things up the one time he takes over for C.J. during a press briefing. Plus, the seasons after continue to be just as clever & intriguing to watch (except for being annoyed by Donna from the very start).",5,A Nice Surprise...,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,963,"['was', 'late', 'bloomer', 'when', 'came', 'watching', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'tune', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'picture', 'being', 'entertained', 'politics', 'was', 'wrong', 'caught', '1st', 'season', 'episode', 'Bravo', 'one', 'weekend', 'show', 'had', 'probably', 'been', 'air', 'several', 'seasons', 'point', 'was', 'hooked', 'instantly', 'so', 'smart', 'informative', 'not', ""'re"", 'Democrat', 'Repulican', 'etc', 'make', 'valid', 'arguments', 'political', 'party', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'Sam', 'Josh', 'Toby', 'can', 'be', 'arrogant', 'times', ""'re"", 'such', 'good', 'guys', 'overall', 'fell', 'love', 'three', 'Anyway', 'favorite', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'Celestial', 'Navigation', 'so', 'funny', 'how', 'badly', 'Josh', 'mucks', 'things', 'one', 'time', 'C.J', 'press', 'briefing', 'seasons', 'continue', 'be', 'just', 'clever', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'being', 'annoyed', 'Donna', 'very', 'start']",The West Wing: Season 1

600115,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00005JLF3,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[103, 122]","This DVD has the first eleven episodes with a bonus of interviews with the writer Sorkin and most of the cast.West Wing is one of the better ensemble dramas ever screened on television. However it was only after seeing the interviews of Sorkin and the cast members that one realised how it was done. Sorkin is clearly highly intelligent and his scripts are powerful and the basis of the show. This becomes clear when you hear the cast members talk. They lack the presence of their on screen personalities and although they are talented actors one realises that it is the structure of the plot and their lines which creates the characters.Sorkin also indicates how in reality the plots have a high level of sentimental resolutions. One doesn?t pick this up in watching it. Sorkin explains how he uses humour to break up the flow of the story and to prevent the material becoming mawkish. He also indicates that although the White House portrayed is a Democrat one, he interplays conservative and liberal story lines. On first viewing the show it appeared to be moderately liberal but on re-watching the episodes on the CD Sorkin is right. The second episode is highly nationalistic and the last scene is the character played by Martin Sheen regretting that Americans cannot walk the earth with the same protection that was afforded the ancient romans. In other episodes the character Donna argues strongly the Republican line on taxation.Watching these eleven episodes after watching them on TV some years ago, one is still struck by the strength of the characters, the frantic pace of the action and the fact that the scenes are seldom static. Even though one begins to see that there is a sentimentality which initially slips by you, one can still be moved when Toby arranges the funeral and honour guard for the homeless war veteran. It is however the humour and intelligence which is the driving force of the series and what makes it so watchable.",5,Best Show on TV,1030320000,"08 26, 2002",2002,1950,"['DVD', 'first', 'eleven', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'writer', 'Sorkin', 'most', 'cast.West', 'Wing', 'one', 'better', 'ensemble', 'dramas', 'ever', 'screened', 'television', 'However', 'was', 'only', 'seeing', 'interviews', 'Sorkin', 'cast', 'members', 'one', 'realised', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'Sorkin', 'clearly', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'scripts', 'are', 'powerful', 'basis', 'show', 'clear', 'when', 'hear', 'cast', 'members', 'talk', 'lack', 'presence', 'screen', 'personalities', 'are', 'talented', 'actors', 'one', 'structure', 'plot', 'lines', 'characters.Sorkin', 'also', 'how', 'reality', 'plots', 'have', 'high', 'level', 'sentimental', 'resolutions', 'One', 'doesn', 't', 'pick', 'up', 'watching', 'Sorkin', 'how', 'humour', 'break', 'up', 'flow', 'story', 'prevent', 'material', 'becoming', 'mawkish', 'also', 'White', 'House', 'portrayed', 'Democrat', 'one', 'conservative', 'liberal', 'story', 'lines', 'first', 'viewing', 'show', 'appeared', 'be', 'moderately', 'liberal', 're-watching', 'episodes', 'CD', 'Sorkin', 'right', 'second', 'episode', 'highly', 'nationalistic', 'last', 'scene', 'character', 'played', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'regretting', 'Americans', 'can', 'not', 'walk', 'earth', 'same', 'protection', 'was', 'afforded', 'ancient', 'romans', 'other', 'character', 'Donna', 'strongly', 'Republican', 'line', 'taxation.Watching', 'eleven', 'episodes', 'watching', 'TV', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'still', 'struck', 'strength', 'characters', 'frantic', 'pace', 'action', 'fact', 'scenes', 'are', 'seldom', 'static', 'Even', 'one', 'see', 'sentimentality', 'initially', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'moved', 'when', 'Toby', 'funeral', 'honour', 'guard', 'homeless', 'war', 'veteran', 'however', 'humour', 'intelligence', 'driving', 'force', 'series', 'what', 'so', 'watchable']",The West Wing: Season 1
