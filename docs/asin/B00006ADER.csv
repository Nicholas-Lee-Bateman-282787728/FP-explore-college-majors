708757,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00006ADER,Alistair McHarg,"[8, 8]","Go Tigers! is a wonderful, and wonderfully deceptive, movie.  When viewed casually it flies by like an NFL highlights reel, slick, glossy, beautifully photographed, and expertly edited.  These are universally familiar images, the great touchdown pass, the banks of lights, players banging into each other in testosterone-fueled euphoric celebration.  Then you stop to remember.  This is a documentary about high school football, and even more importantly, precisely what high school football means in Massillon, Ohio.  (Turns out it determines the future of the school system!)Go Tigers! is the brainchild of Ken Carlson, he wrote, directed, and produced - and, as luck would have it, he's from Massillon.  This makes his achievement even more remarkable because the one attribute that dominates this movie is how even-handed and fair it is.Movies in this genre fall into two groups, either they are love-struck anthems honoring the virtues of sportsmanship and its inspiring way of embodying all that is noble about life - or - they are supercilious indictments of the anti-intellectual hod-carriers and Neanderthals that brutalize each other instead of pursuing worthwhile activities - translating Proust into Sanskrit for example.Massillon, Ohio is football crazy by any standard, but Carlson never takes cheap shots, he doesn't laugh at his subject, nor does he idealize it, he simply presents it.  This is the very hard work of a documentary, and Carlson succeeds.Where Friday Night Lights gave us a grotesque portrait of the psychological, and physical, damage done by football mania in Texas, Go Tigers! calmly introduces us to a funeral director presenting the ""Obie Special,"" a deluxe coffin souped up to warm the cold dead heart of even the most rabid Tigers fan.  The film counts on you to do the math for yourself.",5,Grrrrrrrrr 8,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,1826,"['Go', 'Tigers', 'wonderful', 'wonderfully', 'deceptive', 'movie', 'When', 'viewed', 'casually', 'NFL', 'highlights', 'reel', 'slick', 'glossy', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'expertly', 'edited', 'are', 'universally', 'familiar', 'images', 'great', 'touchdown', 'pass', 'banks', 'lights', 'players', 'banging', 'other', 'testosterone-fueled', 'euphoric', 'celebration', 'Then', 'stop', 'remember', 'documentary', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'precisely', 'what', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'Massillon', 'Ohio', 'out', 'future', 'school', 'system', 'Go', 'Tigers', 'brainchild', 'Ken', 'Carlson', 'wrote', 'directed', 'produced', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Massillon', 'achievement', 'even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'one', 'attribute', 'movie', 'how', 'even-handed', 'fair', 'genre', 'fall', 'two', 'groups', 'are', 'love-struck', 'anthems', 'honoring', 'virtues', 'sportsmanship', 'inspiring', 'way', 'embodying', 'noble', 'life', 'are', 'supercilious', 'indictments', 'anti-intellectual', 'hod-carriers', 'Neanderthals', 'brutalize', 'other', 'instead', 'pursuing', 'worthwhile', 'activities', 'translating', 'Proust', 'Sanskrit', 'example.Massillon', 'Ohio', 'football', 'crazy', 'standard', 'Carlson', 'never', 'cheap', 'shots', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'subject', 'idealize', 'simply', 'very', 'hard', 'work', 'documentary', 'Carlson', 'succeeds.Where', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'gave', 'grotesque', 'portrait', 'psychological', 'physical', 'damage', 'done', 'football', 'mania', 'Texas', 'Go', 'Tigers', 'calmly', 'introduces', 'funeral', 'director', 'presenting', 'Obie', 'Special', 'deluxe', 'coffin', 'souped', 'up', 'warm', 'cold', 'dead', 'heart', 'even', 'most', 'rabid', 'Tigers', 'fan', 'film', 'do', 'math']",Go Tigers!
708758,AVC65SGZ7CT5,B00006ADER,"BasinBictory ""Mister Basin to You""","[1, 1]","I bought this DVD in part because it was recommended to me by a fellow fan of H.G. Bissinger's magnificent book, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; who described this documentary as &quot;FNL in movie form.&quot;While I still found it inferior to FNL, &quot;Go Tigers&quot; is a suberb documentary in the vein of &quot;Hoop Dreams.&quot;Go Tigers follows the Massillon High School Tigers football team through the 1999 season. The Tigers are a legendary team in the state of Ohio. In fact, in 1951, a newsreel was put together chronicling the enormous success of the program - &quot;11 state championships in the last 15 seasons, more college players and captains than any other school in the nation, etc.&quot; However, in 1998, the Tigers were a lackluster 4-6, a losing record almost unheard of in the program's long and storied history. The 1999 Tigers are not only playing to recapture the respect due their inheritance, but to convince the citizens of Massillon to approve a school levy that will bring in much needed funds to their deteriorating school. The players, coaches, boosters, parents, and everyone else associated with the team understands that the riding on the success of their team is not only community pride and bragging rights, but perhaps the fate of their school and thus, their football program as well.The documentary mostly focuses on the Tigers' tri-captains: Their star quarterback, middle linebacker, and defensive tackle. These three are the core of the team, and on their young shoulders ride the hopes and dreams of an entire community.",5,Terrific documentary on high school football,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,1567,"['bought', 'DVD', 'part', 'was', 'recommended', 'fellow', 'fan', 'H.G', 'Bissinger', 'magnificent', 'book', 'quot', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'quot', 'who', 'described', 'documentary', 'quot', 'FNL', 'movie', 'form.', 'quot', 'still', 'found', 'FNL', 'quot', 'Go', 'Tigers', 'quot', 'suberb', 'documentary', 'vein', 'quot', 'Hoop', 'Dreams.', 'quot', 'Go', 'Tigers', 'Massillon', 'High', 'School', 'Tigers', 'football', 'team', '1999', 'season', 'Tigers', 'are', 'legendary', 'team', 'state', 'Ohio', 'fact', '1951', 'newsreel', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'chronicling', 'enormous', 'success', 'program', 'quot', '11', 'state', 'championships', 'last', '15', 'seasons', 'more', 'college', 'players', 'captains', 'other', 'school', 'nation', 'etc.', 'quot', 'However', '1998', 'Tigers', 'were', 'lackluster', '4-6', 'losing', 'record', 'almost', 'unheard', 'program', 'long', 'storied', 'history', '1999', 'Tigers', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'playing', 'recapture', 'respect', 'due', 'inheritance', 'convince', 'citizens', 'Massillon', 'approve', 'school', 'levy', 'will', 'bring', 'much', 'needed', 'funds', 'deteriorating', 'school', 'players', 'coaches', 'boosters', 'parents', 'everyone', 'else', 'associated', 'team', 'riding', 'success', 'team', 'not', 'only', 'community', 'pride', 'bragging', 'rights', 'perhaps', 'fate', 'school', 'thus', 'football', 'program', 'well.The', 'documentary', 'mostly', 'Tigers', 'tri-captains', 'star', 'quarterback', 'middle', 'linebacker', 'defensive', 'tackle', 'three', 'are', 'core', 'team', 'young', 'shoulders', 'ride', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'entire', 'community']",Go Tigers!

708760,AWQSHRGVWKGXY,B00006ADER,brent,"[1, 1]","I live in a town that I considered to be big on high school sports.  I was wrong.  This film portrays a town controlled by football so incredibly well.  It shows harsh and brutal reality, as well as unpredictability and compassion.  This film follows the people of Massilon, Ohio, a town where the Massilon High School Tigers football team rules everything.  It wonderfully portrays the people and the lifestyles of the town.  The film follows the three team captain, the coach and lots of random other towns people.  This documentary brings up big questions about whether sports are more important than education, social and ecemonical classes, high school &quot;recruiting&quot; and tax payers views on levy's to save the school.  This team is so popular in this town that all the money from the school system is pumped into the football program.  You play football or care about football or become an outcast.  There are pep rallies every week, stores devoted completely to the team and they even have an actual tiger for their mascot.  But with this football program being so big, the school is beginning to fail.  A levy is proposed to help fix them, but with the tigers coming off of a 4-6 losing season, it seems impossible to pass a levy without having an awesome season.  This documentarian has entered into this project not knowing the outcome and has made a brilliant film otu of it.  This is a must see for nearly anyone.  It is highly enjoyable, funny, suspenseful and dramatic.

708762,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00006ADER,stoic,"[0, 0]","Being from Alabama, I always assumed that the South was unsurpassed its myopic devotion to football. Go Tigers!, therefore, came as something of a shock. Massillon, Ohio, has taken football hysteria to new depths. Massillon's football boosters go so far as to visit the local hospital to put tiny plastic footballs in the cribs of newborn boys. (If newborn girls get anything, we don't hear about it).The football in this movie is only mildly interesting. It is the people of Massillon who fascinate. The kids on the Massillon High team are under almost-unbearable pressure to win every game (something that their parents and coaches attempt to rationalize away). The ""win-at-all-costs"" philosophy definitely prevails; one of the team's star players has spent 15 months in jail for rape; another transferred into  Massillon High under questionable circumstances.A good sub-plot in Go Tigers! concerns the Massillon's attempts to pass a levy to improve the local schools. While the community is passionate about football, education is not as popular. The three stars of the Massillon team all get scholarship offers to play college football; but two of the three struggle to get standardized test scores high enough to be admitted to college.One of the more-interesting aspects of the film is the extent to which some families in Massillon plan their boys' education around their sons' high school football ""careers."" Many of the families hold their sons back for a second year in the 8th grade so that they will be bigger and more experienced by the time they are seniors.As a final note, the cinematography in Go Tigers! is wonderful. The filmmakers captured some wonderful shots of Massillon.Go Tigers! covers ground that other books and movies have also covered. Still, it provides an excellent look at the uneasy intersection of sport and education in our high schools.",5,Football Fever in Ohio,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,1873,"['Being', 'Alabama', 'always', 'assumed', 'South', 'was', 'unsurpassed', 'myopic', 'devotion', 'football', 'Go', 'Tigers', 'therefore', 'came', 'something', 'shock', 'Massillon', 'Ohio', 'taken', 'football', 'hysteria', 'new', 'depths', 'Massillon', 'football', 'boosters', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'visit', 'local', 'hospital', 'put', 'tiny', 'plastic', 'footballs', 'cribs', 'newborn', 'boys', 'newborn', 'girls', 'get', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'football', 'movie', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'people', 'Massillon', 'who', 'fascinate', 'kids', 'Massillon', 'High', 'team', 'are', 'almost-unbearable', 'pressure', 'win', 'game', 'something', 'parents', 'coaches', 'attempt', 'rationalize', 'away', 'win-at-all-costs', 'philosophy', 'definitely', 'one', 'team', 'star', 'players', 'spent', '15', 'months', 'jail', 'rape', 'transferred', 'Massillon', 'High', 'questionable', 'circumstances.A', 'good', 'sub-plot', 'Go', 'Tigers', 'concerns', 'Massillon', 'attempts', 'pass', 'levy', 'improve', 'local', 'schools', 'community', 'passionate', 'football', 'education', 'not', 'popular', 'three', 'stars', 'Massillon', 'team', 'get', 'scholarship', 'offers', 'play', 'college', 'football', 'two', 'three', 'struggle', 'get', 'standardized', 'test', 'scores', 'high', 'enough', 'be', 'admitted', 'college.One', 'more-interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'extent', 'families', 'Massillon', 'plan', 'boys', 'education', 'sons', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'careers', 'Many', 'families', 'hold', 'sons', 'back', 'second', 'year', '8th', 'grade', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'bigger', 'more', 'experienced', 'time', 'are', 'seniors.As', 'final', 'note', 'cinematography', 'Go', 'Tigers', 'wonderful', 'filmmakers', 'captured', 'wonderful', 'shots', 'Massillon.Go', 'Tigers', 'covers', 'ground', 'other', 'books', 'movies', 'have', 'also', 'covered', 'Still', 'excellent', 'look', 'uneasy', 'intersection', 'sport', 'education', 'high', 'schools']",Go Tigers!
