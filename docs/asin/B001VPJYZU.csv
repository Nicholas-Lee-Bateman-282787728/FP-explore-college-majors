1244069,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001VPJYZU,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 7]","""Brothers and Sisters"" is a show created back in 2006 by Jon Robin Baitz (a writer who worked on ""Alias"" and ""West Wing"").  The series revolves around the Walker family, an upperclass family that owns business known as Ojai foods.During the first season of the series, the family is rocked by the death of the father and business owner, William Walker.  But even more shocking to the family is that their father had a mistress and an illegitimate daughter but that William had embezzled money from the company.  So, the family focuses on the lives of the Walker family and how the brothers and sisters must move on with the family business and make sure it is not run into the ground and try to keep it afloat.There are a total of 24 episodes in season 3 (Episodes 40-63).VIDEO & AUDIO:Video is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions.  There are a lot of outdoor and indoor shots and ""Brothers and Sisters"" does have quite a bit of grain but nothing too distracting.  But for the most part, picture quality is satisfactory.Audio is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, the show is mostly dialogue-based but there are quite a bit of music featured in the episodes, but the audio is pretty much front and center channel driven and audio is clear.  There are no really need for major sound effects for ""Brothers and Sisters"" but for the most part, dialogue and background music are heard quite clearly.  My receiver setup preference was set as ""Stereo on all Channels"".SPECIAL FEATURES:""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Third Season"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:* ABC Starter Kit - If you hit play all on disc 1, you will get the ABC Starter Kit which briefly explains about what happened in the previous seasons of ""Brothers and Sisters"".* The Ojai Experience - (12:44) Co-producer Sparky Hawes talks about bringing the cast on a trip to a real family-owned winery in Ojai and how it works.  The cast talks about their experiences at the winery and see the complexities of seeing a family running a winery and their daily challenges.* Deleted Scenes - A total of three deleted scenes which include: You Hurt Your Sister (:55), Prospective Family (1:47) and You're Gonna Be Late (:29)DISC 2:* In-Between Scenes - (6:35) How the talents are behind-the-scenes during filming such as a pull up contest, toy robot fighting game and other behind-the-scenes fun among a few of the cast members.  How the set has a family atmosphere and the beautiful locations where the show is shot and also behind-the-scenes on some scenes especially the garage sale for the episode ""Everything Must go"".* Deleted Scenes - A total of four deleted scenes which include: I Want to See You (:20), She Could Grow a Conscience (:36), The Walkers are Seductive (1:18) and The Dog House (:34).DISC 3:* The Mothers of Brothers & Sisters - (10:18) The writers, producers and talent talk about the mothers on the show and how many talents see Sally Field's Nora similar to their own mother and Sally Field talks about how many people come up to her and tell her that her character is like their mother and more.* Deleted Scenes - A total of two deleted scenes which include Robert Confronts his Past (2:14) and Behind Closed Doors (:14).DISC 4:* Audio Commentary - Audio commentary for ""Troubled Waters, Part 1' with Actors Rob Lowe and Matthew Rhys and Executive Producer Monica Owusu-Breen.* Deleted Scenes - A total of three deleted scenes which include Hottest Woman On the Planet (:30), We Have Issues (2:06) and Thank You (:44).DISC 5:* Audio Commentary - Audio commentary for ""Troubled Waters, Part 2' with Actors Rob Lowe and Matthew Rhys and Executive Producer Monica Owusu-Breen.* Deleted Scenes - A total of three deleted scenes which include This Is All Weird To Me (:59), Calm Down Mom (:23) and Robert's Discovery (2:05).DISC 6:* Audio Commentary - Audio commentary for ""Mexico"" with Executive Producers Alison Schapker, Monica Owusu-Breen and Ken Olin.* Bloopers & Outtakes - (5:03) ""Brothers & Sisters"" Season Three Blooper Reel.* Deleted Scenes - A total of four deleted scenes which include News About Tommy (1:19), Good Night (:41), I Just Want To be With You (:29), and Knowing What You Do (:56).JUDGMENT CALL:""Brothers and Sisters"" definitely had quite a bit of surprising moments for the third season.  For the first half of the season, our attention was focused on the family dynamics with Kitty and Robert focusing on adoption, Saul's sexuality and wanting to come out, Justin and Rebecca's relationship and starting to feel disconnected with the military and of course, Sarah and Tommy trying to keep the business afloat.  While Nora, was being a mother as usual and involved in her family's lives and trying to find out more about Williams other illegitimate child Ryan.But I guess, what surprised me the most was seeing how Kitty and Robert's marriage had this major change during the second half was a bit of a surprise.  As for the character of Tommy, with rumors on the entertainment gossip blogs that Balthazar Getty was leaving the show, now I'm not sure if Tommy is even going to be a factor in future episodes, let alone seasons.  But the hype around something bad was going to happen with a character in the series definitely made things more exciting and seeing what was going to happen in the ""Troubled Waters"" episodes, but the episode did set the tone for the second half of the season.As for the DVD, the DVD is a solid release but I did find it interesting that instead of putting the deleted scenes in one disc (since most of them are quite short), they spread them out on all discs.  I wish there were more audio commentary with someone in the Walker family included on the disc but overall, the amount of special features should make fans content with the box set.Overall, ""Brothers and Sisters"" had a solid third season and definitely it will be interesting to see where the writers take the series for it's fourth.  If you have invested in the previous two seasons, ""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Third Season"" is definitely worth recommending!",5,More Ojai Walker family goodness (and drama) and an interesting story shift in the second half of the third season,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,6118,"['Brothers', 'Sisters', 'show', 'created', 'back', '2006', 'Jon', 'Robin', 'Baitz', 'writer', 'who',

1244084,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001VPJYZU,Robert Moore,"[4, 10]","BROTHERS AND SISTERS has continued through its three seasons to be a consistently interesting series, but also one that has rarely truly surprised me.  The vast majority of episodes has something of the feel of a formula to them.  In fact, the writers have obviously become so aware of the formula that they even verged on the edge of self-parody.  The forumla is familiar to anyone who has watched the show:  one member of the Walker family confesses a secret to another member.  Somehow or other the possessor of the secret leaks it to another or someone guesses the secret.  Within seconds 6 or 7 or 8 people know what was supposed to be an exclusive secret between just two.  Once a show gets to the point where they begin to parody themselves on this, you can guess that as a device that it has become overused.  And that was certainly the case on BROTHERS AND SISTERS.I have to confess that this is a show that I've often been conflicted over.  On the one hand, it is a character-based serial drama, which is far and away my favorite kind of TV series.  All my absolutely favorite shows, like BUFFY and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS and VERONICA MARS and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, have been character-based serial dramas.  And my complaint about many shows is that they either are not sufficiently character-based (the STARGATES and many other Sci-fi shows, for instance) or not sufficiently serial (my main complaint with GOSSIP GIRL in its second season, in which its story arcs shrank to two to three episodes).  So in theory BROTHERS AND SISTERS should be my kind of show.  Furthermore, the show has an excellent cast.  Many cite Sally Field as a favorite, though I have to say that her character quickly gets on my nerves.  In fact, this is the case with many of the characters on the show.  I love Rachel Griffiths, but I'm not terribly attached to her character Sarah.  Ditto Matthew Rhys, who is a very fine actor, but whose character Kevin has always struck me as far too gruff to be especially likable.  (On the other hand, in debates on boards about which actors on TV from England or Australia or similar countries have the best American accents, I often argue that Griffiths and Rhys have the best adopted accents on TV.)  If Kevin is too gruff, I find Balthazar Getty's Tommy to be too grumpy.  And Dave Annable's Justin is too sensitive.  And Calista Flockhart's Kitty is just too spineless.  And so on and so forth.  And Patricia Wettig's Holly Harper is one of my least favorite characters on TV.  In short, I just dislike many of the characters.  So while the show is a character-based serial, I find that I just don't care about the development of the characters.  I do like Emily VanCamp's Rebecca (and I hope that she remains the good person that she has been shown to be in the first three seasons -- I like putting characters through the wringer, but not by crushing their moral backbone) and love Ron Rifkin's Saul, who has always to my mind been an underutilized character.  I vaguely enjoy each episode of the show, though at the same time I'm aware that I don't much care what happens to any of the character (except Rebecca and Saul).So, on the one hand I respect the format of this show and like that we see characters change and evolve over time.  On the other hand, these are far from my favorite group of characters on TV and I find many of the individual episodes quite formulaic.  Contrast this with a show like FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, where I both love the format and adore the characters.  Another interesting contrast is GOSSIP GIRL, where I like the characters more than those on BROTHERS AND SISTERS, but increasingly dislike the format of the show (I'm convinced that the CW imagines that if GOSSIP GIRL maintains story arcs that last more than a couple of episodes, the viewers will find the show too challenging and will abandon it -- which would be strange given that GG is in fact a very low rated show with fewer viewers than any ""buzzworthy"" show on TV -- if they lengthened the story arcs they might actually attract more mature viewers).  I'll probably continue to watch BROTHERS AND SISTERS in Season Four.  But it definitely is not must-see TV for me and if the time came when I felt that I had to give up a show or two in order to find time for other things, it would be one of the first shows I would think about sacrificing.",4,I like the show's ambitions but increasingly find the characters and stories to be less and less interesting,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,4366,"['BROTHERS', 'SISTERS', 'continued', 'three', 'seasons', 'be', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'series', 'also', 'one', 'rarely', 'truly', 'surprised', 'vast', 'majority', 'episodes', 'something', 'feel', 'formula', 'fact', 'writers', 'have', 'obviously', 'become', 'so', 'aware', 'formula', 'even', 'verged', 'edge', 'self-parody', 'forumla', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'show', 'one', 'member', 'Walker', 'family', 'secret', 'member', 'Somehow', 'other', 'possessor', 'secret', 'leaks', 'someone', 'secret', 'Within', '6', '7', '8', 'people', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'exclusive', 'secret', 'just', 'two', 'show', 'point', 'where', 'begin', 'parody', 'can', 'guess', 'device', 'become', 'overused', 'was', 'certainly', 'case', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS.I', 'have', 'confess', 'show', ""'ve"", 'often', 'been', 'conflicted', 'one', 'hand', 'character-based', 'serial', 'drama', 'far', 'away', 'favorite', 'kind', 'TV', 'series', 'absolutely', 'favorite', 'shows', 'BUFFY', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'have', 'been', 'character-based', 'serial', 'dramas', 'complaint', 'many', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'character-based', 'STARGATES', 'many', 'other', 'Sci-fi', 'shows', 'instance', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'serial', 'main', 'complaint', 'GOSSIP', 'GIRL', 'second', 'season', 'story', 'arcs', 'shrank', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'So', 'theory', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'should', 'be', 'kind', 'show', 'Furthermore', 'show', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Many', 'cite', 'Sally', 'Field', 'favorite', 'have', 'say', 'character', 'quickly', 'nerves', 'fact', 'case', 'many', 'characters', 'show', 'love', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', ""'m"", 'not', 'terribly', 'attached', 'character', 'Sarah', 'Ditto', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'who', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'character', 'Kevin', 'always', 'struck', 'far', 'too', 'gruff', 'be', 'especially', 'likable', 'other', 'hand', 'debates', 'boards', 'actors', 'TV', 'England', 'Australia', 'similar', 'countries', 'have', 'best', 'American', 'accents', 'often', 'argue', 'Griffiths', 'Rhys', 'have', 'best', 'adopted', 'accents', 'TV', 'Kevin', 'too', 'gruff', 'find', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Tommy', 'be', 'too', 'grumpy', 'Dave', 'Annable', 'Justin', 'too', 'sensitive', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'Kitty', 'just', 'too', 'spineless', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'Holly', 'Harper', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'characters', 'TV', 'short', 'just', 'dislike', 'many', 'characters', 'So', 'show', 'character-based', 'serial', 'find', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'development', 'characters', 'do', 'Emily', 'VanCamp', 'Rebecca', 'hope', 'good', 'person', 'been', 'shown', 'be', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'like', 'putting', 'characters', 'wringer', 'not', 'crushing', 'moral', 'backbone', 'love', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'Saul', 'who', 'always', 'mind', 'been', 'underutilized', 'character', 'vaguely', 'enjoy', 'episode', 'show', 'though', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'aware', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'what', 'character', 'Rebecca', 'Saul', '.So', 'one', 'hand', 'respect', 'format', 'show', 'see', 'characters', 'change', 'evolve', 'time', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'far', 'favorite', 'group', 'characters', 'TV', 'find', 'many', 'individual', 'episodes', 'quite', 'formulaic', 'Contrast', 'show', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'where', 'love', 'format', 'characters', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'GOSSIP', 'GIRL', 'where', 'characters', 'more', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'increasingly', 'format', 'show', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'CW', 'imagines', 'GOSSIP', 'GIRL', 'story', 'arcs', 'last', 'more', 'couple', 'episodes', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'show', 'too', 'challenging', 'will', 'abandon', 'would', 'be', 'strange', 'given', 'GG', 'fact', 'very', 'low', 'rated', 'show', 'fewer', 'viewers', 'buzzworthy', 'show', 'TV', 'lengthened', 'story', 'might', 'actually', 'attract', 'more', 'mature', 'viewers', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'continue', 'watch', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'Season', 'Four', 'definitely', 'not', 'must-see', 'TV', 'time', 'came', 'when', 'felt', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'show', 'two', 'order', 'find', 'time', 'other', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'first', 'would', 'think', 'sacrificing']",Brothers and Sisters: Season 3
