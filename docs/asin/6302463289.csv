Not only that, but there are two different discs of this title available on DVD. If you get the version with the subtitle Blue Movie Blue you will get both the Widescreen version and the Full screen version on a flipper disc.  Two Shades of Blue only contains the cropped Full screen.Wild Orchid 2 is about a girl who joins a bordello after the death of her jazz musician father. As Blue, she can be anyone her clients pay her to be and she feels nothing, almost as if she is a doll. But when one of her young clients begins to see through her facade and sees the woman beneath the blank exterior, she finds herself falling in love as well but the danger of escaping the life she has gotten into may be too great a risk.While not a openly sexual as the previous entry, WO 2 is nicely shot and very richly colored. The setting has changed as well; it's now 1958 in the South. I've never seen the unrated cut but this isn't too shabby.",3,Two Discs of Blue,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,1016,"['Wild', 'Orchid', '2', 'nothing', 'do', 'Wild', 'Orchid', 'aside', 'title', 'wild', 'flower', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'discs', 'title', 'available', 'DVD', 'get', 'version', 'subtitle', 'Blue', 'Movie', 'Blue', 'will', 'get', 'Widescreen', 'version', 'Full', 'screen', 'version', 'flipper', 'disc', 'Two', 'Shades', 'Blue', 'only', 'cropped', 'Full', 'screen.Wild', 'Orchid', '2', 'girl', 'who', 'bordello', 'death', 'jazz', 'musician', 'father', 'Blue', 'can', 'be', 'anyone', 'clients', 'pay', 'be', 'nothing', 'almost', 'doll', 'when', 'one', 'young', 'clients', 'see', 'facade', 'woman', 'blank', 'exterior', 'falling', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'danger', 'escaping', 'life', 'gotten', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'great', 'risk.While', 'not', 'openly', 'sexual', 'previous', 'entry', 'WO', '2', 'nicely', 'shot', 'very', 'richly', 'colored', 'setting', 'changed', 'as', 'well', 'now', '1958', 'South', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'unrated', 'cut', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby']",N/A
