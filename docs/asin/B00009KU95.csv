753849,AERQW3PJ9B7PG,B00009KU95,A reader,"[12, 16]","This DVD set contains a compilation of news stories presented as history years after the fact by Walter Cronkite and his cronies at CBS News.This series of 30-minute programs does provides an opportunity to see how the war was covered by CBS News. But Cronkite's introductions to the stories, produced about 15 years after their original broadcast, ignore history, making the series disingenuous and self serving.For instance, in its segment on the 1968 Tet Offensive, CBS's original reporting that Tet was a US military disaster, soon followed by Cronkite's inappropriately influential pronouncement that the war could not be won, is unchallenged. Yet North Vietnamese General Vo Ngyuen Giap's lengthy interview with Stanley Karnow in the June 24, 1990, edition of the New York Times (easily available online at the Times Web site) tells an entirely different story from what is shown here.Briefly summarizing, Giap said that the Viet Cong (a creation of Hanoi, he said) ceased to be a fighting force after Tet. The communists lost between 25,000 and 50,000 soldiers killed durnig Tet. They expected the South Vietnamese people to rise up and join them during the coordinated Tet attacks; the people didn't. But, upon seeing the US media's reporting of the Tet Offensive as a US defeat, Giap said, the North Vietnamese leaders realized that all they had to do was hold on to eventually prevail. And, Giap said, that is exactly what they did. (Besides the Giap interview, Peter Braestrup's two-volumeBig Story: How the American press and television reported and interpreted the crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington (Westview special studies in communication)is a real eye-opener. It is also available inan abridged version.)This CBS presentation covers none of this. The ""first draft of history"" is presented here as the final word leaving us with nothing more than a self-congratulatory rehash of CBS's original biased reporting.",1,And that's the way it wasn't...,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,1938,"['DVD', 'set', 'compilation', 'news', 'stories', 'presented', 'history', 'years', 'fact', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'cronies', 'CBS', 'News.This', 'series', '30-minute', 'programs', 'opportunity', 'see', 'how', 'war', 'was', 'covered', 'CBS', 'News', 'Cronkite', 'introductions', 'stories', 'produced', '15', 'years', 'original', 'broadcast', 'ignore', 'history', 'making', 'series', 'disingenuous', 'serving.For', 'instance', 'segment', '1968', 'Tet', 'Offensive', 'CBS', 'original', 'reporting', 'Tet', 'was', 'US', 'military', 'disaster', 'soon', 'followed', 'Cronkite', 'inappropriately', 'influential', 'pronouncement', 'war', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'won', 'unchallenged', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'General', 'Vo', 'Ngyuen', 'Giap', 'lengthy', 'interview', 'Stanley', 'Karnow', 'June', '24', '1990', 'edition', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'easily', 'available', 'online', 'Times', 'Web', 'site', 'entirely', 'different', 'story', 'what', 'shown', 'here.Briefly', 'summarizing', 'Giap', 'said', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'creation', 'Hanoi', 'said', 'ceased', 'be', 'fighting', 'force', 'Tet', 'communists', 'lost', '25,000', '50,000', 'soldiers', 'killed', 'durnig', 'Tet', 'expected', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'rise', 'up', 'join', 'coordinated', 'Tet', 'attacks', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'US', 'media', 'reporting', 'Tet', 'Offensive', 'US', 'defeat', 'Giap', 'said', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'leaders', 'realized', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'hold', 'eventually', 'prevail', 'Giap', 'said', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'Giap', 'interview', 'Peter', 'Braestrup', 'two-volumeBig', 'Story', 'How', 'American', 'press', 'television', 'reported', 'interpreted', 'crisis', 'Tet', '1968', 'Vietnam', 'Washington', 'Westview', 'special', 'studies', 'communication', 'real', 'eye-opener', 'also', 'available', 'inan', 'abridged', 'version', 'CBS', 'presentation', 'none', 'first', 'draft', 'history', 'presented', 'here', 'final', 'word', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'more', 'self-congratulatory', 'rehash', 'CBS', 'original', 'biased', 'reporting']",Vietnam War With Walter Cronkite

I was at the point where I honestly thought I'd seen every bit of film ever shot in Vietnam during the American involvement (65-72) and then from 72 to the fall of Saigon in 75. Then I stumbled across this gem.Cronkite hosts this series and runs us through some classic news reports from back then. The reporting is unbiased and the comments from the troops is raw and from the gut.I was about aged 4 when America stormed the beach at Da Nang, and we were getting the news reports in England. I remember that Vietnam took up a lot of time on the news broadcasts and, somewhere in my childhood brain I stored a lot of the information away. Watching these DVD's, I saw the same reports over again and even remembered some of the outcomes. I was instantly transferred back to the time.The reporters in Vietnam asked tough questions. and were all guts. Out on patrol with the GI's, eating with them, living with them and just being a part of the group for the period of the report. Unlike what we saw in Iraq where reporters were ""embedded"" with specific units. Controversy over this arrangement has stemmed from the reporters being unable to remain neutral as they now identified with the unit and had formed friendships with the soldiers.I've watched the siege of Hue so many times before but this DVD had new, unseen (for me) footage. They even showed some of the original news feeds routed via Japan at the time.Vietnam is fascinating, from the politics that got USA into combat to the rout by the North Vietnamese that reunified the country. A true David and Goliath story. It's all in this collection.Honestly, if you are into Vietnam then this one really is worth getting. It's unbiased, uncritical and unedited. Very worthy addition to your collection.",5,A Lot of unseen unbiased news footage,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1820,"['lot', 'guys', 'age', ""'m"", 'obsessed', 'things', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'point', 'where', 'honestly', 'thought', ""'d"", 'seen', 'bit', 'film', 'ever', 'shot', 'Vietnam', 'American', 'involvement', '65-72', 'then', '72', 'fall', 'Saigon', '75', 'Then', 'stumbled', 'gem.Cronkite', 'series', 'classic', 'news', 'reports', 'back', 'then', 'reporting', 'unbiased', 'comments', 'troops', 'raw', 'gut.I', 'was', 'about', 'aged', '4', 'when', 'America', 'stormed', 'beach', 'Da', 'Nang', 'were', 'getting', 'news', 'reports', 'England', 'remember', 'Vietnam', 'took', 'up', 'lot', 'time', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'somewhere', 'childhood', 'brain', 'stored', 'lot', 'information', 'away', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'saw', 'same', 'reports', 'again', 'even', 'remembered', 'outcomes', 'was', 'instantly', 'transferred', 'back', 'time.The', 'reporters', 'Vietnam', 'asked', 'tough', 'questions', 'were', 'guts', 'patrol', 'GI', 'eating', 'living', 'just', 'being', 'part', 'group', 'period', 'report', 'what', 'saw', 'Iraq', 'where', 'reporters', 'were', 'embedded', 'specific', 'units', 'Controversy', 'arrangement', 'stemmed', 'reporters', 'being', 'unable', 'remain', 'neutral', 'now', 'identified', 'unit', 'had', 'formed', 'friendships', 'soldiers.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'siege', 'Hue', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'DVD', 'had', 'new', 'unseen', 'footage', 'even', 'showed', 'original', 'news', 'feeds', 'routed', 'Japan', 'time.Vietnam', 'fascinating', 'politics', 'got', 'USA', 'combat', 'rout', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'reunified', 'country', 'true', 'David', 'Goliath', 'story', 'collection.Honestly', 'are', 'Vietnam', 'then', 'one', 'really', 'worth', 'getting', 'unbiased', 'uncritical', 'unedited', 'Very', 'worthy', 'addition', 'collection']",Vietnam War With Walter Cronkite

Many of the segments are the closest thing that you can come to recreating for students today what was meant by the often used phrase ""living room war"" or ""television war""...of how television affected Americans' perception of the war and the power that the visual image had in emotionally affecting viewers.  Many of my college students were profoundly affected themselves in viewing images from those CBS news reports--such as the report on ""enemy body counts"", where a helicopter airlifts a netload of Vietnamese corpses or a segment where we learn of young Americans who eventually died in the process of claiming and  relinquishing nameless hills.

It's a great presentation of the War. Since I was born the year the actual war ended in 1975, it showed me what great soldiers we have in this country!
