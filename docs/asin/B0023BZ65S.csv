1248964,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0023BZ65S,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","If you believe this to be a film is about the thrill and excitement of fighting monsters that include Godzilla, you may need to refrain from viewing.  This is a slow paced mockumentary about a Japanese man who is now semi-retired, and is on call to fight monsters for saving Japan.  The film is a satirical take on the many poorly done Godzilla movies.A film crew follows Big Man Japan who uses electricity to enlarge himself and who is past his prime, sadly out of the loop.  He is certainly not a well loved figure, criticized for ruining the environment and nature.  The superhero trait has been in his family for generations, and he struggles to keep it up.  However, his audience calls him fat and edgy, and says his  performances are pathetic.  Big Man Japan takes public transportation, has an agent who makes more money that he does.  He fights the enemy monsters with advertising on his massive body.The film is with very subtle humor that is certainly not for everyone.  If you are not into foreign film and not understanding of this mockumentary humor, you may be disappointed.  This is fun, and the spoof on the monster fighting is just that, a wacky spoof.  Although the fight scenes at the end are rather lengthy. The ending is pretty clever, See it twice to catch more that may have passed you the first time. Subtitles are easy to read....Rizzo",5,Wacky slow-paced spoof,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,1360,"['believe', 'be', 'film', 'thrill', 'excitement', 'fighting', 'monsters', 'include', 'Godzilla', 'may', 'need', 'refrain', 'viewing', 'slow', 'paced', 'mockumentary', 'Japanese', 'man', 'who', 'now', 'semi-retired', 'call', 'fight', 'monsters', 'saving', 'Japan', 'film', 'satirical', 'take', 'many', 'poorly', 'done', 'Godzilla', 'movies.A', 'film', 'crew', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'who', 'electricity', 'enlarge', 'who', 'prime', 'sadly', 'loop', 'certainly', 'not', 'well', 'loved', 'figure', 'criticized', 'ruining', 'environment', 'nature', 'superhero', 'trait', 'been', 'family', 'generations', 'keep', 'up', 'However', 'audience', 'fat', 'edgy', 'performances', 'are', 'pathetic', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'public', 'transportation', 'agent', 'who', 'more', 'money', 'enemy', 'monsters', 'advertising', 'massive', 'body.The', 'film', 'very', 'subtle', 'humor', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'are', 'not', 'foreign', 'film', 'not', 'understanding', 'mockumentary', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fun', 'spoof', 'monster', 'fighting', 'just', 'that', 'wacky', 'spoof', 'fight', 'scenes', 'end', 'are', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'ending', 'pretty', 'clever', 'See', 'twice', 'catch', 'more', 'may', 'have', 'passed', 'first', 'time', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'easy', 'read']",Big Man Japan

1248967,AISFIRDOCTP92,B0023BZ65S,Captain Cuttle,"[2, 6]","As previous reviews have stated, don't go by the American trailer, which makes this look like a fast-moving monster farce for Godzilla fans.  Don't go by Roger Ebert's reverent review, either.  This is not ""This is Spinal Tap"" or anything like that.  It will be off-putting and inaccessible for many people.  The central conceit is excellent: a man who can expand on demand to fight bizarre monsters, yet has trouble in his personal life.  But most of the film is him mumbling on and on about his troubles, and when the monster fights do come, they are over quickly and aren't interestingly staged for the most part.  There are several good laughs, and the monsters are ingenious, but it's not worth putting up with the excruciatingly slow interviews of this loser.  I love dead-pan humor, but this was just dead.  I'm told that if you know about this-or-that genre of Japanese film, you'll get the inside jokes.  Fair enough.  Nobody in the crowd I watched it with, ages 13 - 50, male and female, got it.  And we watch a wide variety of foreign movies, cult hits, and so on.Then there's that ending.  I'm persuaded by some of the reviews that it's a commentary on the loss of Japanese culture, and on the state of Japan - U.S. relations.  OK, but that commentary had no place in this movie.  The movie didn't earn its sudden turn into supposedly deeper depths.  It was arbitrary.  Some movies, I don't mind not getting the ending or the hidden depths until after thought and discussion.  This one did not build to anything or deserve making its audience work to get it.So, if you are looking for a movie that is weird for the sake of weirdness, or if you have a deep and subtle understanding of certain Japanese cult movie genres (see other reviews for details), by all means seek this movie out.  Otherwise, even if you pride yourself on the breadth of your tastes and perception, avoid it.",1,"For connoisseurs of weird, or those who get the inside jokes, only",1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,1892,"['previous', 'reviews', 'have', 'stated', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'American', 'trailer', 'look', 'fast-moving', 'monster', 'farce', 'Godzilla', 'fans', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'reverent', 'review', 'either', 'not', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'anything', 'will', 'be', 'off-putting', 'inaccessible', 'many', 'people', 'central', 'conceit', 'excellent', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'expand', 'demand', 'fight', 'bizarre', 'monsters', 'yet', 'trouble', 'personal', 'life', 'most', 'film', 'mumbling', 'troubles', 'when', 'monster', 'fights', 'do', 'come', 'are', 'quickly', 'are', ""n't"", 'interestingly', 'staged', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'several', 'good', 'laughs', 'monsters', 'are', 'ingenious', 'not', 'worth', 'putting', 'up', 'excruciatingly', 'slow', 'interviews', 'loser', 'love', 'dead-pan', 'humor', 'was', 'just', 'dead', ""'m"", 'told', 'know', 'this-or-that', 'genre', 'Japanese', 'film', ""'ll"", 'get', 'inside', 'jokes', 'Fair', 'enough', 'Nobody', 'crowd', 'watched', '13', '50', 'male', 'female', 'got', 'watch', 'wide', 'variety', 'foreign', 'movies', 'cult', 'hits', 'so', 'ending', ""'m"", 'persuaded', 'reviews', 'commentary', 'loss', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'state', 'Japan', 'U.S.', 'relations', 'OK', 'commentary', 'had', 'place', 'movie', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'earn', 'sudden', 'turn', 'supposedly', 'deeper', 'depths', 'was', 'arbitrary', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'not', 'getting', 'ending', 'hidden', 'depths', 'thought', 'discussion', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'build', 'anything', 'deserve', 'making', 'audience', 'work', 'get', 'it.So', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'weird', 'sake', 'weirdness', 'have', 'deep', 'subtle', 'understanding', 'certain', 'Japanese', 'cult', 'movie', 'genres', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'details', 'means', 'seek', 'movie', 'out', 'Otherwise', 'even', 'pride', 'breadth', 'tastes', 'perception', 'avoid']",Big Man Japan

1248969,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0023BZ65S,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[2, 3]","""Big Man Japan""(Magnolia/Magnet Films, 2009)---------------------------------------** Spoilers below **---------------------------------------""Big Man Japan"" (""Dainipponjin"") is a feature-length sci-fi comedy directed by and starring comedian Hitoshi Matsumoto; it is a dry, laconic mockumentary about Japan's last superhero, a depressive, forlorn, middle-aged loser who is paid a small stipend by the Japanese government to keep him on a retainer as the nation's last monster slayer.  The glory days of Godzilla and Rodan are decades past; now the only monsters that show up to menage Tokyo are bizarre, grotesque oddities -- a giant head on a single leg that jumps from building to building, a flatulent flower-pod monster that comes to the city just to hang out and blocks traffic.The camera crew follows Big Man through his daily routine, peeling back the layers of his sorrow, as we discover how sad his private life has become and how bored he is with his mission.  It's a pretty funny movie, although the humor is very dry and slow-moving.  For the right audience, this is a real gut-buster, although many viewers might find it inaccessible.  Some of the humor revolves around the casting -- many of Matsumoto's creative partners are cast as the monsters -- but the film itself isn't particularly ""Japanese"" in the sense that you don't need to have a specialized knowledge of modern Japanese culture to ""get"" the jokes. Just knowing about the tradition of low-budget monster movies in the 1950s and '60s, as well as superhero kid's shows such as ""Ultraman"" is really all you need. This is a very funny movie, destined to become a cult classic.

It's pseudo-documentary in the same style as Christopher Guest, but with a less obvious comedic timing, more humble, unassuming characters and a hefty injection of pure, unabashed Japanese absurdity. The camera's focal point is Masaru, a soft spoken middle-aged loser with a going-nowhere life and zero self confidence, who nonchalantly moonlights as the fifteen-story tall, nearly naked hero ""Big Japanese Man."" Despite saving the city from a series of rampaging monsters, public interest in his work is waning and he's beginning to find it difficult to make ends meet. Excruciatingly slow at points, it has a few interesting things to say about the longevity of the superheroic profession and the notoriously fickle nature of public favor, but much of that is lost beneath the burden of such a painfully dull lead character. Its dry, bizarre sense of humor hits the mark more often than not, and the CGI fight scenes make for quite the spectacle, but this really didn't need to be half as long as it is.

Big Man is a quiet, sometimes touching, sometimes ridiculous movie, but it wasn't very funny, nor was it a giant monster movie, which I had expected it to be.The closest reference I can think of is the movie Kairo / Pulse.  Kairo looks like a horror movie on the outside, but it's more of an existential thing.  It's not horror, unless one finds tedium and lonliness to be horrifying.  Like Big Man, Kairo isn't a bad move, it's just a little too vague.I especially didn't get the live action end of the movie.  I do get that the movie tries to spoof the old giant monster tv shows like Ultraman or Space Giants.  But I found the live footage jarringly inappropriate after such a thoughtful, introspective journey for the main character.  If the entire movie, or at least the main battle scenes had been done in a similar over-the-top manner, the movie would've been really funny.

I love monster movies and while the idea that a man turns into a giant to protect Tokyo from the various monsters that attack. This idea, which is kind of Jet Jaguar (Godzilla vs. Megalon) crossed with Apache Chief (Super Friends), seems like perfect Anime material.Big Man Japan is a live action mockumentary however. Yes feel free to groan now. Look I loved this is Spinal Tap as much as the next bloke, but the reason Spinal Tap worked was not because it was a fake documentary but because Stonehenge statue was 6 inches tall and in danger of being crushed by dancing dwarfs.If you fake a documentary and don't write jokes and funny bits it simply is a boring documentary that isn't true. This whole `the character and situations provide an inside laugh' does not work. You got to write some bloody jokes.Eighty percent of Big Man Japan consists of our hero [who is a dead wringer for Neil (the hippie) from The Young Ones] sitting. Sometimes he sits and rambles on about how bad his life is and sometimes, as God as my witness, he just sits. In what possible universe is this entertainment?The monster stuff tries too hard as well.

But even as one who's seen a pretty small amount of Japanese film (except Kurosawa, a true genius), I still found it slyly funny during the many slow character-driven parts, and incredibly stupidly hilarious during the fight scenes.Even if you get bored with the satire of the superhero's daily life (it is indeed very dry wit and meant for those with enough intellect to not demand a new fight every two minues), simply fast forward to the half dozen fight scenes, which are among the most insanely goofy visual weirdness I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty. They mock the monster genre while simultaneously glorying in the splendid silliness of the whole concept. Plus, the monsters are some of the weirdest creatures you will ever see. Just looking at them is funny, but watching them fight the bored superhero is a whole new type of laugh.This comedy turns all sorts of ideas on their heads and exposes the idiocy of not only fanboys and cultists but also the selfishness of modern people, whatever culture they're from.Highly recommended for those with imagination, and those who can laugh at their own preconceptions.And remember, even if you get bored, make sure to ff to the fight scenes.

1248979,A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B0023BZ65S,Otto Correct,"[1, 1]","Big Man Japan is a mockumentary following the life of a man who grows 20 stories tall to save Japan from giant monster attacks ala Godzilla.The grand irony of all this, as other reviewers have pointed out, is that while he's called Big Man Japan, he's a very small person.  He lives in poverty, the broadcasts of his fights air at 2am to low ratings, his wife left him and is embarassed to let thier daughter be around him, the people he protects find him more of a bother than a hero, and his agent takes advantage of him.  Its an interesting commentary on how fame doesn't assure a person of glory or riches, as well as an interesting way of showing how people sometimes cling to dying tradtions because they don't know where else to turn to.The humor in most of this film is found in the awkward and defeating circumstances BMJ is often in.  In this respect it reminded me of the UK version of the Office, its very VERY dry.  The situations were so awkward and depressing that I didn't really laugh out loud all that much, but upon thinking about it later it was funnier in retrospect.  Your experience may vary, but that's about how it was for me with the UK Office too.  Some of it is really funny looking back, but dry enough to be uncomfortable in the moment.The monster fights, on the other hand, are completely absurd and insane.  They are rendered in (I assume intentionally) cheesey, low budget CGI.  Its used to excellent effect in just smacking you upside the head with their weirdness.  I'd liken them to more of a sketch comedy styled parody of giant monster battles, and it makes for quite a contrast with the extremely dry humor found in the live action sequences.Some have complained that they didn't get the movie and needed to be more ""in the know"" with what its making fun of.  I disagree.  I don't think a person has to have an intimate knowledge of the giant monster sub-genre of Japanese cinema, they just have to know that it exists; that for a period of time it was trendy to feature movies where men in rubber monster suits fought each other.  Really, if you've seen more than one Godzilla or Gamera movie, or caught a few episodes of Ultra-Man or the Power Rangers as a kid, you'll have all you need to ""get"" what this movie is trying to do.Overall, I liked the film, but there are two key areas where I thought it could've been better.  First off, the pace.  This movie could've been 20 minutes shorter and not have lost a single joke.  As is, it drags quite a bit.  Overall, the dryness of the humor and the slower pace makes the movie's puchline of an ending hit quite a bit harder, as it is a DRASTIC change in tone (I laughed myself silly the first time I saw it, and you will too, provided you've seen either Ultra-Man or the Power Rangers), but it could have been just as effective had they cut more of the dead space leading up to the good scenes.Secondly, I thought BMJ himself could've been made a bit more sympathetic of a character.  We feel like his life is sad, but there are a few times where he just flat-out lies to the camera crew or acts a little bit like a jerk to them, and it takes away from his likeability.  Like the pacing issue, a few small edits were all we needed to change this, and he would've been a much more sympathetic character as a result, we would've had a much stronger desire to see him succeed.THE BOTTOM LINE:  An interesting, if somewhat flawed film.  It was definitely an original concept, and I enjoyed it, even if it was a bit on the slow side.",3,Godzilla meets The Office...,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,3517,"['Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'mockumentary', 'following', 'life', 'man', 'who', '20', 'stories', 'tall', 'save', 'Japan', 'giant', 'monster', 'attacks', 'ala', 'Godzilla.The', 'grand', 'irony', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'called', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'very', 'small', 'person', 'poverty', 'broadcasts', 'fights', 'air', '2am', 'low', 'ratings', 'wife', 'left', 'embarassed', 'let', 'thier', 'daughter', 'be', 'people', 'find', 'more', 'bother', 'hero', 'agent', 'advantage', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'how', 'fame', ""n't"", 'assure', 'person', 'glory', 'riches', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'way', 'showing', 'how', 'people', 'sometimes', 'cling', 'dying', 'tradtions', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'else', 'turn', 'to.The', 'humor', 'most', 'film', 'found', 'awkward', 'defeating', 'circumstances', 'BMJ', 'often', 'respect', 'reminded', 'UK', 'version', 'Office', 'very', 'VERY', 'dry', 'situations', 'were', 'so', 'awkward', 'depressing', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'that', 'much', 'thinking', 'later', 'was', 'funnier', 'retrospect', 'experience', 'may', 'vary', 'how', 'was', 'UK', 'Office', 'too', 'really', 'funny', 'looking', 'back', 'dry', 'enough', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'moment.The', 'monster', 'fights', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'completely', 'absurd', 'insane', 'are', 'rendered', 'assume', 'intentionally', 'cheesey', 'low', 'budget', 'CGI', 'used', 'excellent', 'effect', 'just', 'smacking', 'head', 'weirdness', ""'d"", 'liken', 'more', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'styled', 'parody', 'giant', 'monster', 'battles', 'quite', 'contrast', 'extremely', 'dry', 'humor', 'found', 'live', 'action', 'sequences.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'know', 'what', 'making', 'fun', 'disagree', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'person', 'have', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'giant', 'monster', 'sub-genre', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'just', 'have', 'know', 'period', 'time', 'was', 'trendy', 'feature', 'movies', 'where', 'men', 'rubber', 'monster', 'suits', 'fought', 'other', 'Really', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'one', 'Godzilla', 'Gamera', 'movie', 'caught', 'few', 'episodes', 'Ultra-Man', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'kid', ""'ll"", 'have', 'need', 'get', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'do.Overall', 'liked', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'key', 'areas', 'where', 'thought', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'First', 'pace', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', '20', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'not', 'have', 'lost', 'single', 'joke', 'quite', 'bit', 'Overall', 'dryness', 'humor', 'slower', 'pace', 'movie', 'puchline', 'ending', 'hit', 'quite', 'bit', 'harder', 'DRASTIC', 'change', 'tone', 'laughed', 'silly', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'will', 'too', 'provided', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ultra-Man', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'effective', 'had', 'cut', 'more', 'dead', 'space', 'leading', 'up', 'good', 'scenes.Secondly', 'thought', 'BMJ', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'bit', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'feel', 'life', 'sad', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'just', 'flat-out', 'lies', 'camera', 'crew', 'little', 'bit', 'jerk', 'away', 'likeability', 'pacing', 'issue', 'few', 'small', 'edits', 'were', 'needed', 'change', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'result', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'much', 'stronger', 'desire', 'see', 'succeed.THE', 'BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'original', 'concept', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'side']",Big Man Japan

While fighting these monsters he causes massive amounts of property damage and the populous begins to hate and ostracize him.

When the journalist asks him questions Big Man mumbles and answers in two word replies. I think the writer was trying to establish him as the lovable loser type but it didn't take long for me to dislike him as much the Japanese citizens. The longer interview scenes where painful and I found myself waiting for him to fight the next strange creature but even when that happened it was disappointing half of the time. Though some of the fights and creatures where pretty funny, the movie only got a few chuckles from me and my friends. It's one of those movies where the trailer in funnier than the film.",3,Objects may appear larger than they seem,1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,1498,"['movie', 'appear', 'funnier', 'really', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'showed', 'lot', 'promise', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'comparable', 'film', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'imagination', 'hilarity', 'Maybe', 'set', 'standards', 'too', 'high', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'harrowing', 'tale', 'middle', 'aged', 'loser', 'who', 'electrocuting', 'nipple', 'clamps', 'can', 'transform', 'bigger', 'middle', 'aged', 'loser', 'wearing', 'diaper', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'abilities', 'lack', 'there', 'defend', 'Japan', 'array', 'ridiculous', 'monsters', 'example', 'one', 'monster', 'head', 'foot', 'one', 'monster', 'rubber', 'band', 'arms', 'fighting', 'monsters', 'massive', 'amounts', 'property', 'damage', 'populous', 'begins', 'hate', 'ostracize', 'film', 'shot', 'documentary', 'journalist', 'following', 'Big', 'Man', 'common', 'human', 'form', 'around', 'attempts', 'see', 'daughter', 'Ex-wife', 'When', 'journalist', 'questions', 'Big', 'Man', 'mumbles', 'answers', 'two', 'word', 'replies', 'think', 'writer', 'was', 'trying', 'establish', 'lovable', 'loser', 'type', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'dislike', 'as', 'much', 'Japanese', 'citizens', 'longer', 'interview', 'scenes', 'where', 'painful', 'found', 'waiting', 'fight', 'next', 'strange', 'creature', 'even', 'when', 'happened', 'was', 'disappointing', 'half', 'time', 'fights', 'creatures', 'where', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'only', 'got', 'few', 'chuckles', 'friends', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'trailer', 'funnier', 'film']",Big Man Japan
1248985,A1EFGUACSYDQUE,B0023BZ65S,"Sloppy D ""SloppyD""","[1, 2]","I watched it based on the loopy trailer. As others have stated (even fans of the film), it's a complete bait-and-switch. This is a slapstick CGI comedy about giant monsters the same way ""Run Lola Run"" is a cartoon about a chick running up and down stairs. As for the rest . . well, I'll be kind and call it ""dry."" If you have zero familiarity with Ultraman or Spectreman, just skip to the next film on your list. I was only vaguely aware of the source material, but always regarded its appeal as a mystery I was never going to be motivated to crack. That aspect of Japanese culture might have appealed on a purely superficial level when I was 10 and loved Godzilla movies, but now it seems quaint at best.The ending of the film is going to seem incomprehensible to anyone without very specific interests in the material it's ribbing, which isn't the case in other much better mockumentaries. Would I find it hysterical if I bothered to dig deeper into old Ultraman? Maybe, but nothing about this tedious exercise inspires me to invest the time required to do so. I can't imagine watching a few hours of oddball Japanese fluff is going to suddenly let me see BMJ as a comedy classic. Life's too short; there are too many other great movies to discover to justify devoting more time to a genre that just doesn't connect with me.This humor takes aim at very specific targets. The mockumentary portion of the film (80% of its running time, I'll guess) has everything one could want in a comedy . . except actual jokes or wit. If you tend to enjoy wacky Japanese humor, there's a chance you might appreciate it. Heck, I'm glad I saw it if only because it's unlike anything I've ever seen -- and thus gets an extra star. But as a viewing experience or candidate for repeat viewing, I vote ""nay."" I've given Japanese kitsch several chances to grab my attention over the years, and nothing's stuck. But, I'm a sucker for punishment, so I'm sure another attempt is forthcoming with a different film.",2,"Well, I tried . .

For example, ""Downtown"" is not a name that is going to mean much to most Americans, but they are a phenomenal comedy-duo that are incredibly influential and whose style dominates much of modern Japanese comedy. ThinkMonty Python's Flying Circus,The Second City Theatre, orSaturday Night Live.""Big Man Japan"" (Japanese title ""Dai-Nipponjin"" or ""Giant Japanese Person"") is ""Downtown"" member Matsumoto Hitoshi's big screen debut as both a staring actor and a director.  Much of the humor is in his trademark style, and he brought along plenty of famous friends for cameos, although noticeably missing is his ""Downtown"" partner Masatoshi Hamada.The film is done in a mockumentary-style, following the life of slacker Daisatou Masaru who has inherited his power to grow to an enormous size from his father and his now-senile grandfather, both who previously served as ""Big Man Japan.""  Masaru draws a government salary to protect Japan from the various Godzilla-like monsters that attack from time to time, but his heart isn't really in it.  The public mocks him and complains about the property damage and environmental aspects of his battles.  His manager sells advertising space on his giant body.  Things just aren't going well.Most of the first part of the film is just following Masaru around, looking in on his daily life, dingy apartment and how he looks after his senile grandfather.  When duty calls, however, he swells up to battle the monster-of-the-week (many of whom are the aforementioned cameos of famous friends), sometimes managing to beat the monster away but sometimes getting it handed to him.  The final sequence goes to even more left-field, as Big Man Japan gets to live his dream by joining theUltramansquad, and all pretense of story goes out the window.All of the monsters are CGI, and they are intentionally done in a cheesy manner.  Like the bad special effects on shows like ""Saturday Night Live,"" much of the humor comes from how terrible and unrealistic the special effects are, and from seeing famous comedians morphed into giant versions of themselves.  Other than these big flashes, the humor is done in a deadpan-style, and it isn't a fast-paced movie until the final payoff in the end.I really enjoyed ""Big Man Japan,"" but I think this is because I lived over in Japan for several years and am a huge fan of ""Downtown.""  Like the filmTakeshis, which also was cameo-ridden,  this just isn't something that was made for the overseas market, and I think if I was seeing it cold then I wouldn't have enjoyed it.  Fans of pure absurdity will probably get a kick out of it, and people who enjoy a good man-in-suit giant monster movies likeThe Super Robot Red BaronandAll Monsters Attackmight find something good here too. Otherwise, it is probably going to be a snoozer for you.",3,Beware the Big Man Japan!,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,2943,"['are', ""n't"", 'fairly', 'familiar', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'comedy', 'then', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'miss', 'lot', 'what', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'offer', 'example', 'Downtown', 'not', 'name', 'going', 'mean', 'much', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'comedy-duo', 'are', 'incredibly', 'influential', 'style', 'much', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'comedy', 'ThinkMonty', 'Python', 'Flying', 'Circus', 'Second', 'City', 'Theatre', 'orSaturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Dai-Nipponjin', 'Giant', 'Japanese', 'Person', 'Downtown', 'member', 'Matsumoto', 'Hitoshi', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'staring', 'actor', 'director', 'Much', 'humor', 'trademark', 'style', 'brought', 'along', 'plenty', 'famous', 'friends', 'cameos', 'noticeably', 'missing', 'Downtown', 'partner', 'Masatoshi', 'Hamada.The', 'film', 'done', 'mockumentary-style', 'following', 'life', 'slacker', 'Daisatou', 'Masaru', 'who', 'inherited', 'power', 'grow', 'enormous', 'size', 'father', 'now-senile', 'grandfather', 'who', 'previously', 'served', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'Masaru', 'government', 'salary', 'protect', 'Japan', 'various', 'Godzilla-like', 'monsters', 'attack', 'time', 'time', 'heart', ""n't"", 'really', 'public', 'complains', 'property', 'damage', 'environmental', 'aspects', 'battles', 'manager', 'advertising', 'space', 'giant', 'body', 'Things', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'well.Most', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'just', 'following', 'Masaru', 'looking', 'daily', 'life', 'dingy', 'apartment', 'how', 'senile', 'grandfather', 'When', 'duty', 'however', 'up', 'battle', 'monster-of-the-week', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'aforementioned', 'cameos', 'famous', 'friends', 'sometimes', 'managing', 'beat', 'monster', 'away', 'sometimes', 'getting', 'handed', 'final', 'sequence', 'even', 'more', 'left-field', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'live', 'dream', 'joining', 'theUltramansquad', 'pretense', 'story', 'out', 'window.All', 'monsters', 'are', 'CGI', 'are', 'intentionally', 'done', 'cheesy', 'manner', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'shows', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'much', 'humor', 'how', 'terrible', 'unrealistic', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'seeing', 'famous', 'comedians', 'morphed', 'giant', 'versions', 'Other', 'big', 'flashes', 'humor', 'done', 'deadpan-style', ""n't"", 'fast-paced', 'movie', 'final', 'payoff', 'end.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Big', 'Man', 'Japan', 'think', 'lived', 'over', 'Japan', 'several', 'years', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Downtown', 'filmTakeshis', 'also', 'was', 'cameo-ridden', 'just', ""n't"", 'something', 'was', 'made', 'overseas', 'market', 'think', 'was', 'seeing', 'cold', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Fans', 'pure', 'absurdity', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'kick', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'man-in-suit', 'giant', 'monster', 'movies', 'likeThe', 'Super', 'Robot', 'Red', 'BaronandAll', 'Monsters', 'Attackmight', 'something', 'good', 'here', 'too', 'Otherwise', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'snoozer']",Big Man Japan
