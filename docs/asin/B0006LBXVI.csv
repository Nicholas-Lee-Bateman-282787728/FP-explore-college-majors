871002,A1GDFOQTIPYE9K,B0006LBXVI,"A. Devico ""Triviamagnet""","[0, 0]","This video was a gift for a family friend who'd remembered seeing this with his parents in the theater when he was a small boy.  It is a film rarity, in that it was one of Douglas Fairbanks' few 'talkies'.  When seeing it, I found it to be a breezy, light weight version of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe story, updated to the (then) modern times of the 1930s, with Fairbanks as a playboy/adventurer cruising with friends on a yacht in the south Pacific.  The group happens upon what appears to be an uninhabited island prompting a conversation of idyllic life and self reliance.  Fairbanks' bravado brings about a 'bet' in which he claims he can survive and thrive on the island with few tools and no modern amenities.  He plunges into the waters, swimming to shore, his yacht mates pledging to return in some months to check up on him and determine the outcome of the bet.  What ensues during the film is how he goes about his life on the island and his interactions with an island tribe and their runaway princess.  The film, made following Fairbanks' heyday as a box office swashbuckler, is quaint by modern standards and fairly predictable, but I must admit I viewed it with a curious interest.  It does tend to stretch credibility in a few instances and is cliched, by modern standards, however it was entertaining.  Add a star more to the rating if you're a fan of early talkies, and especially one of Fairbanks Sr's. followers.",3,Rarity For Douglas Fairbanks (Sr.),1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1428,"['video', 'was', 'gift', 'family', 'friend', 'who', ""'d"", 'remembered', 'seeing', 'parents', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'boy', 'film', 'rarity', 'was', 'one', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'few', ""'talkies"", 'When', 'seeing', 'found', 'be', 'breezy', 'light', 'weight', 'version', 'Defoe', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'story', 'updated', 'then', 'modern', 'times', '1930s', 'Fairbanks', 'playboy/adventurer', 'cruising', 'friends', 'yacht', 'south', 'Pacific', 'group', 'what', 'be', 'uninhabited', 'island', 'prompting', 'conversation', 'idyllic', 'life', 'self', 'reliance', 'Fairbanks', 'bravado', ""'bet"", 'can', 'survive', 'thrive', 'island', 'few', 'tools', 'modern', 'amenities', 'waters', 'swimming', 'shore', 'yacht', 'pledging', 'return', 'months', 'check', 'up', 'determine', 'outcome', 'bet', 'What', 'film', 'how', 'life', 'island', 'interactions', 'island', 'tribe', 'runaway', 'princess', 'film', 'made', 'following', 'Fairbanks', 'heyday', 'box', 'office', 'swashbuckler', 'quaint', 'modern', 'standards', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'must', 'admit', 'viewed', 'curious', 'interest', 'tend', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'few', 'instances', 'cliched', 'modern', 'standards', 'however', 'was', 'entertaining', 'Add', 'star', 'more', 'rating', ""'re"", 'fan', 'early', 'talkies', 'especially', 'one', 'Fairbanks', 'Sr', 'followers']",N/A
871003,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0006LBXVI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 7]","This is as fun and enjoyable a movie as I have seen for some time.  The early days of film produced some wonderful movies, and this 1932 classic is more fun that a barrel full of monkeys.  Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., plays a happy-go-lucky fellow who is so taken by the beauty of the uninhabited islands of the South Seas that he decides to forego his intended hunting expedition and settle on the nearest deserted island.  His friend bets him he will be tied to a stake by cannibals by the time the ship returns the next year, and he in turn swears he will turn the island into his own private Manhattan.  With one thousand dollars riding on this friendly bet, Fairbanks' unnamed character jumps into the water and makes for shore with absolutely nothing but the shirt on his back; his loyal dog follows him, and they quickly set up shop on the island.  This guy may have led a pretty easy life, but he is amazingly adept at island-settling; he makes the Professor look like Gilligan.  After finding food, water, and a suitable spot for shelter, he's immediately making his own tools and making a mockery of the term ""roughing it.""  He builds an impressive house (set on stilts, no less) and all kinds of furniture, sets traps for catching game, and creates his own private work force of animals.  His Dr. Doolittle skills soon have his pet monkey milking a captured goat, the goat operating a treadmill under the supervision of the dog, a tortoise slowly turning a wheel to power a sort of water wheel, and that's just the beginning.  He builds his own 18-hole golf course, has the monkey trained to bring him drinks at ""the 19th hole,"" makes his own radio out of slightly more than a couple of coconuts, and does other things Robinson Crusoe would never have even dreamed of.  Throughout it all, he is happy as a clam.When a native from a nearby island turns up on the island, he easily manhandles him and tries to turn him into his own Friday-noting the fact the guy is a headhunter, he laughingly jests that he must be Friday the 13th.  Friday doesn't work out too well, but he has better luck when an attractive native woman finds her way to the island after running away to escape a forced marriage.  Typically, he calls her Saturday, and the two get along famously despite the language barrier.  There's trouble later, when angry islanders invade his private paradise, but nothing gets to this guy.  There is one aspect about the ending I didn't particularly like, but overall this movie boasts swashbuckling action and great family-oriented fun from start to finish.  I especially loved the animals featured prominently in the film; the dog and monkey in particular deserved their own trailers on the set because they were bona fide great actors.  A final appeal of the movie is the scenery; although black and white can't truly capture their mystical beauty, the islands of Tajiti, Fiji, Samoa and other genuine South Sea islands serve as the lavish backdrop for the wild island adventure.",5,More fun than a barrel full of monkeys,1044489600,"02 6, 2003",2003,2995,"['fun', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'early', 'days', 'film', 'produced', 'wonderful', 'movies', '1932', 'classic', 'more', 'fun', 'barrel', 'full', 'monkeys', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Sr.', 'happy-go-lucky', 'fellow', 'who', 'so', 'taken', 'beauty', 'uninhabited', 'islands', 'South', 'Seas', 'forego', 'intended', 'hunting', 'expedition', 'settle', 'nearest', 'deserted', 'island', 'friend', 'will', 'be', 'tied', 'stake', 'cannibals', 'time', 'ship', 'next', 'year', 'turn', 'swears', 'will', 'turn', 'island', 'own', 'private', 'Manhattan', 'one', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'riding', 'friendly', 'bet', 'Fairbanks', 'unnamed', 'character', 'jumps', 'water', 'shore', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'shirt', 'back', 'loyal', 'dog', 'quickly', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'island', 'guy', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'pretty', 'easy', 'life', 'amazingly', 'adept', 'island-settling', 'Professor', 'look', 'Gilligan', 'finding', 'food', 'water', 'suitable', 'spot', 'shelter', 'immediately', 'making', 'own', 'tools', 'making', 'mockery', 'term', 'roughing', 'impressive', 'house', 'set', 'stilts', 'less', 'kinds', 'furniture', 'traps', 'catching', 'game', 'own', 'private', 'work', 'force', 'animals', 'Dr.', 'Doolittle', 'skills', 'soon', 'have', 'pet', 'monkey', 'milking', 'captured', 'goat', 'goat', 'operating', 'treadmill', 'supervision', 'dog', 'tortoise', 'slowly', 'turning', 'wheel', 'power', 'sort', 'water', 'wheel', 'just', 'beginning', 'own', '18-hole', 'golf', 'course', 'monkey', 'trained', 'bring', 'drinks', '19th', 'hole', 'own', 'radio', 'slightly', 'more', 'couple', 'coconuts', 'other', 'things', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'even', 'dreamed', 'happy', 'clam.When', 'native', 'nearby', 'island', 'up', 'island', 'easily', 'tries', 'turn', 'own', 'Friday-noting', 'fact', 'guy', 'headhunter', 'laughingly', 'must', 'be', 'Friday', '13th', 'Friday', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'too', 'well', 'better', 'luck', 'when', 'attractive', 'native', 'woman', 'way', 'island', 'running', 'away', 'escape', 'forced', 'marriage', 'Typically', 'Saturday', 'two', 'get', 'along', 'famously', 'language', 'barrier', 'trouble', 'later', 'when', 'angry', 'islanders', 'invade', 'private', 'paradise', 'nothing', 'guy', 'one', 'aspect', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'overall', 'movie', 'swashbuckling', 'action', 'great', 'family-oriented', 'fun', 'start', 'finish', 'especially', 'loved', 'animals', 'featured', 'prominently', 'film', 'dog', 'monkey', 'particular', 'deserved', 'own', 'trailers', 'set', 'were', 'bona', 'fide', 'great', 'actors', 'final', 'appeal', 'movie', 'scenery', 'black', 'white', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'capture', 'mystical', 'beauty', 'islands', 'Tajiti', 'Fiji', 'Samoa', 'other', 'genuine', 'South', 'Sea', 'serve', 'lavish', 'backdrop', 'wild', 'island', 'adventure']",N/A

871005,A17J42IUR4VP6L,B0006LBXVI,Jenny Goodrich,"[1, 1]","Douglas Fairbanks does a great job in this film. He plays the role of a castaway (Steve) which puts Tom Hanks to shame. Steve bets he can re-create his Park Avenue lifestyle on the island using only his wits. True to his word, within 2 months time he has created every manner of contraption to recreate his life of ease. He captures animals and humans to create servants. He builds a radio and a raised hut that is quite impressive. It's a rather unrealistic story as in real life one would get hurt, and the weather would act up a lot more. Steve never faces a bad wind. He also gets a monkey to milk a goat and his dog to keep another goat walking on a treadmill. In real life it would take 2 months just to train the animals. But no matter, we watch to be amused by all the ingenious contraptions made from palm leaves and coconuts. Steve's love of life is infectious and bordering on mania, but it gets him through. There's a great climax where his friends return to get him while 2 tribes of headhunters come after Steve as well.",5,Very Good Stranded Island Film,1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,1034,"['Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'role', 'castaway', 'Steve', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'shame', 'Steve', 'can', 're-create', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'lifestyle', 'island', 'using', 'only', 'wits', 'True', 'word', '2', 'months', 'time', 'created', 'manner', 'contraption', 'recreate', 'life', 'ease', 'animals', 'humans', 'create', 'servants', 'radio', 'raised', 'hut', 'quite', 'impressive', 'rather', 'unrealistic', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'hurt', 'weather', 'would', 'act', 'up', 'lot', 'more', 'Steve', 'never', 'bad', 'wind', 'also', 'monkey', 'milk', 'goat', 'dog', 'keep', 'goat', 'walking', 'treadmill', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'take', '2', 'months', 'just', 'train', 'animals', 'matter', 'watch', 'be', 'amused', 'ingenious', 'contraptions', 'made', 'palm', 'leaves', 'coconuts', 'Steve', 'love', 'life', 'infectious', 'bordering', 'mania', 'great', 'climax', 'where', 'friends', 'return', 'get', '2', 'tribes', 'headhunters', 'come', 'Steve', 'as', 'well']",N/A
