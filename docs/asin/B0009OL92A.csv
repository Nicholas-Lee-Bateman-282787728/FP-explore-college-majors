Starring Loretta Young, Barry Sullivan, and directed by Tay Garnett, Cause for Alarm! pulls the audience and doesn't let them go not even after the movie has ended. Ellen (Young) plays the devoted wife to her invalid husband, George (Sullivan). However, Ellen has been seeing a different side of her husband, a side that is becoming obsessive, paranoid especially about the relationship between their friend and doctor, Ranney Grahame played by Bruce Cowling. George in his state has become convinced that he and Ellen are trying to kill him in order for the to of them to be together. George doesn't take this lying down, he devises a plan to make sure the two suffer if he must.I had never seen this picture before and thought that it was simply brilliant! I thought the actors were very convincing and their motives were clear. I would have like to known a little more about the time in between this and when Young and Sullivan's character were married in order to see what led up to George's actions, but overall enjoyable and thrilling.

She offers an amazing performance in what turned out to be one of her last movies before focusing on a lucrative television career.

909613,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009OL92A,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[13, 13]","Cause For Alarm (1951) is something of an oddity in the film noir genre, bringing its gritty sense of increasing tension and suspense out of the shadows of the night into the bright, daytime light of suburbia. Only a talented actress could make this story work, and Loretta Young shines in the role of the distraught wife of a paranoid, dying husband. Her character Ellen Jones seems to be quite the devoted wife caring selflessly for her bedridden husband George (Barry Sullivan), and a flashback to the couple's first meeting reveals a husband madly in love with her from the moment he laid eyes on her. This happy-go-lucky fellow is a far cry from the man we meet upstairs suffering from a mysterious heart ailment, for he has come to believe that his wife and best friend/doctor, Ranney Grahame (Bruce Cowling), are plotting to kill him so that they can be together. He is so convinced of this that he sends a thoroughly incriminating letter to the district attorney before confronting Ellen with his charges. He tells Ellen all about the letter that she herself delivered into the hands of the postman but collapses before he is able to exact his mad revenge upon her personally. Ellen's in a real spot; the man she loves has just died trying to kill her, and the terrible letter already on its way to the D.A. will make everyone think she killed him. What she must do, of course, is get that letter back before it reaches its destination. What follows is a frustrating, maddening, increasingly suspenseful paper chase, with all manner of obstacles placed in Ellen's way. Trying to get a letter back from the postman may not sound exciting, but Cause For Alarm delivers an almost frenetically suspenseful plot that leaves one wondering what will happen at the very end. Not only did I wonder if she would get the letter back in time, I wondered if there was more to George's paranoid suspicions than there originally seemed, as Ellen climbs up to the very pinnacle of panic, enmeshing herself in an increasingly entangling web of lies and deceit that stand to bring upon herself the very suspicions that she seeks to avoid. Cause For Alarm really and truly kept me in growing suspense from start to finish, culminating in a perfectly effective and satisfying conclusion.",5,Film noir comes to suburbia in this suspenseful gem,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,2275,"['Cause', 'Alarm', '1951', 'something', 'oddity', 'film', 'noir', 'genre', 'bringing', 'gritty', 'sense', 'increasing', 'tension', 'suspense', 'shadows', 'night', 'bright', 'daytime', 'light', 'suburbia', 'Only', 'talented', 'actress', 'could', 'make', 'story', 'work', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'shines', 'role', 'distraught', 'wife', 'paranoid', 'dying', 'husband', 'character', 'Ellen', 'Jones', 'be', 'quite', 'devoted', 'wife', 'caring', 'selflessly', 'bedridden', 'husband', 'George', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'flashback', 'couple', 'first', 'meeting', 'reveals', 'husband', 'madly', 'love', 'moment', 'laid', 'eyes', 'happy-go-lucky', 'fellow', 'far', 'cry', 'man', 'meet', 'upstairs', 'suffering', 'mysterious', 'heart', 'ailment', 'come', 'believe', 'wife', 'best', 'friend/doctor', 'Ranney', 'Grahame', 'Bruce', 'Cowling', 'are', 'plotting', 'kill', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'so', 'convinced', 'thoroughly', 'incriminating', 'letter', 'district', 'attorney', 'confronting', 'Ellen', 'charges', 'Ellen', 'letter', 'delivered', 'hands', 'postman', 'able', 'exact', 'mad', 'revenge', 'personally', 'Ellen', 'real', 'spot', 'man', 'just', 'died', 'trying', 'kill', 'terrible', 'letter', 'already', 'way', 'D.A', 'will', 'make', 'everyone', 'think', 'killed', 'What', 'must', 'do', 'course', 'get', 'letter', 'back', 'destination', 'What', 'frustrating', 'maddening', 'increasingly', 'suspenseful', 'paper', 'chase', 'manner', 'obstacles', 'placed', 'Ellen', 'way', 'Trying', 'get', 'letter', 'back', 'postman', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'exciting', 'Cause', 'Alarm', 'delivers', 'almost', 'frenetically', 'suspenseful', 'plot', 'one', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'very', 'end', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'wonder', 'would', 'get', 'letter', 'back', 'time', 'wondered', 'was', 'more', 'George', 'paranoid', 'suspicions', 'originally', 'seemed', 'Ellen', 'up', 'very', 'pinnacle', 'panic', 'enmeshing', 'increasingly', 'entangling', 'web', 'lies', 'deceit', 'stand', 'bring', 'upon', 'very', 'suspicions', 'avoid', 'Cause', 'Alarm', 'really', 'truly', 'kept', 'growing', 'suspense', 'start', 'finish', 'culminating', 'perfectly', 'effective', 'satisfying', 'conclusion']",Cause for Alarm
909614,A1GQQFTPA23Z1O,B0009OL92A,Dave,"[8, 8]","-Quite the self-explanatory tagline, used for the 1951 theatrical release of ""Cause for Alarm"", an almost forgotten ""B"" film noir starring the lovely Loretta Young. Directed by Tay Garnett (who directed the noir classic ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"") and produced by Loretta's husband Tom Lewis, ""Cause for Alarm"" was originally a radio play. Actually, it's very interesting how Loretta Young got to play the starring role in this film. Tom Lewis initially wanted Judy Garland for the role of Ellen Jones, but Loretta's lawyer told him that he was discriminating against her because she was his wife. Needless to say, she got the role!Lorreta Young stars as Ellen Jones, a patient, loving, and devoted wife of her sick, bedridden husband George (Barry Sullivan). Over time George has become firmly convinced that his wife is having an affair with his best friend Ranney Grahame (Bruce Cowling) and is plotting with Ranney to kill him. George writes all this down in a letter to the District Attorney and gets his naive wife to hand the letter to the mailman. That's when he drops the bombshell and confronts Ellen about his suspicions. She of course denies his ridiculous claims and tries desperately to assure him of her love and loyalty, but it's no use. Totally losing control, he struggles to his feet and tries to kill her, but instead he falls over and dies.Although she is spared from his murder attempt, Ellen's troubles are just beginning. She quickly realizes that if the letter from her husband reaches the District Attorney she'll be charged with George's murder. She then races against time to get the letter back before it's delivered, but along the way she continuously makes many self-incriminating mistakes (You know, the kind that only a scared innocent person could make!) and has to deal with several annoying people (and one VERY bratty kid) before achieving her goal. Finally George's best friend Ranney Grahame comes to her rescue after hearing what happened, although it may already be too late to save her from a murder charge...The main flaw of ""Cause for Alarm"" is the abrupt ending which totally disappointed me. I was hoping for and expecting much more after the continuous buildup of suspense but instead the ending was very flat and unimpressive. Overall, though, it's quite an entertaining movie, especially for a low-budget ""B"" noir. In my opinion both Loretta Young and Barry Sullivan were highly underated, and their exceptional performances in this movie helped overcome the absurdities of the plot. I first learned of this movie when reading Arthur Lyons superb book _Death on the Cheap: the Lost B Movies of Film Noir_.

Sidewalks dappled with the shade of old trees.  Charming, storybook cottages with beautifully kept lawns and white picket fences.  Why, Andy Hardy and his pals could live here.  But the gang will never put on a show in the backyard of George and Ellen Jones(Barry Sullivan and Loretta Young).  Something is not right.  Their picket fence looks like a row of  shark's teeth.  Their lawn is too evenly manicured.  Even the geraniums in the window boxes are all the same height as if they didn't dare grow otherwise.  Then there's the sign on the fence telling us to close the gate.  Someone here is a control freak and that someone is George.  Ellen informs us that George has denied her everything she wants:  friends(she is truly hurt when the neighbors exclude her from their idle chatter) and what she wanted most of all, children.  He won't even let her have a television.  The charm that once won Ellen's heart has been replaced by George's paranoid dementia, the result of a heart condition.  The once vibrant Ellen has become a drudge stuck inside a dim and gloomy house that is such a contrast to the bright sunshiny world without.  A blistering heat wave is going on but, per George's orders, the house is closed up, the only relief coming from a small, barely moving fan in the kitchen.  Ellen is so isolated her only outside contact is Billy, a cookie and cowboy loving little boy.  So out of touch is Ellen that she has never even heard of Billy's favorite, Hopalong Cassidy, arguably the most popular pop icon of the time.George asks Ellen to mail a letter for him.  When she returns he tells her with demonic glee that he knows all about the plot that she and his best friend and physician, Ranney(Bruce Cowling) has to murder him so they can be together.  The letter was to the district attorney telling all.  George pulls out a gun to shoot Ellen but collapses and dies.  The rest of the picture revolves around Ellen's frantic attempts to retrieve the incriminating letter.

And Ellen's innocence IS questionable.  When George dies Ellen shows no grief at all.  Her only concern is getting the letter back and hiding George's death.  And why is she so sure the DA will believe the letter?  She is an intelligent woman and must know that DA's get letters from crackpots every day.  And there is ample evidence to support George's medical condition -- or isn't there?  Is Ellen reacting from guilt?  Is George less paranoid than his doctor, supposedly Ellen's lover, would have us think?DVD has excellent audio and video quality.

The choreography and cinematography enhance the movie, too. The movie starts out a tad slow but it's all well worth it because eventually the suspense builds up at such a fast rate it all kept me glued to the screen. I was never sure how things would work out until the very last minute or two--and Loretta Young couldn't have done any better as the star of the film.When the action starts (and there's a good deal of action), we quickly meet Ellen Jones (Loretta Young) who altruistically cares for her husband George (Barry Sullivan) who is having heart trouble. She cleans house; tries her best to always be cheerful to keep up George's spirits; makes sure that their old friend and doctor Ranney Grahame (Bruce Cowling) keeps a close eye on George and Ellen even prepares all of George's meals so he can prop himself up in bed and eat comfortably without having to go up and down stairs all the time.Trouble is, however, George doesn't just suffer from a bad heart. George has a delusion that Ellen and Ranney are having a romantic affair--and that they are plotting to kill him so they can be together and marry! George writes a letter to the district attorney to the effect that he believes they are trying to kill him; and worse yet for Ellen, she mails the letter without knowing its contents just before George coincidentally dies from over-excitement as he tries to kill Ellen for being unfaithful to him even though she is the model wife.Ellen must get that letter back before it reaches the district attorney; and so this creates a paper chase like no other! Although some of the trouble Ellen encounters is less than completely believable, overall the story is quite a good thriller. I've left out parts of the story so you can appreciate this film as much as I did; and I won't say much more to avoid spoilers! The rest of the film shows how things play out for Ellen; until the very last moment we are left wondering what will become of Ellen and very likely Ranney, too. Some will say the ending is rather abrupt and they have a point; but the film itself is well done so this becomes a minor quibble.Look also for fine performances by Margalo Gillmore as Mrs. Edwards; Brad Morrow as Billy (aka ""Hoppy""); Irving Bacon as Mr. Carston the postman; Georgia Backus as Mrs. Warren and Art Baker has a good albeit brief role as a post office superintendent.Cause for Alarm is terrific for fans of the actors in the film; and people who enjoy excellent thrillers with lots of suspense will not be disappointed.

He sensed a surprise ending approaching and turned the TV off, the beter to view CA in its entirety. That was a wise move.  The resolution to ""Cause for Alarm"" is as sudden as they come.Loretta Young's husband, Barry Sullivan, is very sick and dying.  We know from a clever film noirish flashback that they met in happier times before Sullivan went off to serve in the Navy. The viewers, but not Young, know that Sullivan is surreptitiously writing a letter to the local District Attorney. It falsely accuses LY and his doctor/friend Bruce Cowling of trying to kill him! He urges LY to post the letter and only after she does reveals the contents.  Then Sullivan dies!Most of CA follows an increasingly frantic Young as she tries to retrieve the letter. Her desperation is in perfect contrast to the lily white, orderly, sunshiny suburban setting. Noirish films seem to poke at 50s suburbia. What happens?  This reviewer would never reveal a resolution!  Viewers will have to watch for themselves but be comforted: ""Cause for Alarm"" is a winner with excellent performances by leads and supporting cast alike, all in a tidy 73 minute run time.Special mention goes to veteran actor Irving Bacon as Mister Carston, the diligent, beleaguered, foot weary postman duly making his appointed rounds.

Ellen's husband George (Barry Sullivan) is recuperating from a heart attack, but, in spite of Ellen's efforts to be cheerful and cater to his every need, George just hasn't been himself since he became ill. He has become morbid, testy, and belligerent. Even his doctor Ranney Grahame (Bruce Cowling), a close personal friend, has noticed the change in George's mental state and is concerned for the strain it's putting on Ellen. Then, on ""that Tuesday in July"", the severity of George's paranoia becomes chillingly clear. After Ellen mails a letter for her husband, he tells her that the letter was addressed to the District Attorney. In it, George accuses Ellen and Dr. Grahame of conspiring to kill him for insurance money. Convinced that he is on death's door, George has made sure that it will look like Ellen killed him. Frantically, Ellen sets off to try to retrieve that letter.""Cause for Alarm"" is a one-trick pony, but it's a good one: Terror and confusion invade suburban idyll. Ellen and George are a loving couple with a cute post-war house and a white picket fence. Ellen is self-sacrificing, optimistic, and scrupulously polite. She spends her days trying to make her husband and her home comfortable. Then something goes awry: Her loving husband turns into a lunatic. ""Cause for Alarm""'s success in achieving both an idyllic environment and the unsettling perversion of this post-war ""American dream"" rests on the performance of Loretta Young. Young had won an Academy Award in 1948 for her performance in ""The Farmer's Daughter"" and was married to one of this film's screenwriters, Tom Lewis, when she made ""Cause for Alarm"". She would go on to host the long-running ""Loretta Young Show"" on television in the 1950s. Here, Young makes Ellen's anguish at her husband's accusations very effecting. We feel that Ellen is deeply hurt by George's mistrust, and, finally, that she is stressed to her limit. Barry Sullivan has only a few scenes as George, but they are essentia. He makes George out to be an intelligent man who seems calculated and in control of his actions, but not of his thoughts. He acts normally to a point, but there is always a sinister twist.
