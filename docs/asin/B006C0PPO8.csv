What bumped it up from being merely a good movie to a great one was the twist towards the end.

1514377,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B006C0PPO8,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[1, 1]","This eerie ghost story stars Rebecca Hall as Florence Cathcart, a very independent lady in post WW1 England. She is a graduate of Cambridge University who likes pants suits, smokes as casually as the men, and is pretty enough to be a movie star. (One sop to modern times---most of the smoking scenes take place outdoors).She also runs her own business working with the police---she exposes fake seances, which are popular in the 1920s because so many people lost loved ones in the war.  Though she reveals the con artists, her lover died in the war and she secretly yearns to see him again if such a thing were possible.We learn early in the movie that she was adopted and later we discover in flashback that her birth father had an affair with the nanny producing a son who is part of the household. Her mother is bitter about the affair, her father is bitter because the lowly housekeeper produced a son and his wife has only provided him with a daughter, which explains Florence's liberated behavior. The mother is angry that her husband prefers his ""bastard"" son to his daughter, who is legitimate.When a schoolmaster requests her help in dealing with a ghost at his boarding school, Florence reluctantly takes the assignment. The scares are subtle, but the movie remains with you for a long time. The penultimate ending is a surprise. The actual ending is ambiguous. There is a tiny scene that I believe gives us the answer, but stating it here might be a spoiler.  I'll just say that every single scene in this movie has importance.",4,A Light in the Dark,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,1538,"['ghost', 'story', 'stars', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Florence', 'Cathcart', 'very', 'independent', 'lady', 'post', 'WW1', 'England', 'graduate', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'who', 'pants', 'suits', 'smokes', 'as', 'casually', 'men', 'pretty', 'enough', 'be', 'movie', 'star', 'One', 'sop', 'modern', 'times', '-most', 'smoking', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'outdoors', '.She', 'also', 'own', 'business', 'working', 'police', '-she', 'exposes', 'fake', 'seances', 'are', 'popular', '1920s', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'war', 'con', 'artists', 'lover', 'died', 'war', 'secretly', 'see', 'again', 'such', 'thing', 'were', 'possible.We', 'learn', 'early', 'movie', 'was', 'adopted', 'later', 'discover', 'flashback', 'birth', 'father', 'had', 'affair', 'nanny', 'producing', 'son', 'who', 'part', 'household', 'mother', 'bitter', 'affair', 'father', 'bitter', 'lowly', 'housekeeper', 'produced', 'son', 'wife', 'only', 'provided', 'daughter', 'Florence', 'liberated', 'behavior', 'mother', 'angry', 'husband', 'bastard', 'son', 'daughter', 'who', 'legitimate.When', 'schoolmaster', 'help', 'dealing', 'ghost', 'boarding', 'school', 'Florence', 'reluctantly', 'assignment', 'scares', 'are', 'subtle', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'penultimate', 'ending', 'surprise', 'actual', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'tiny', 'scene', 'believe', 'answer', 'stating', 'here', 'might', 'be', 'spoiler', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'single', 'scene', 'movie', 'importance']",The Awakening

As an American, it helped me (a lot!) to finally run it with the subtitles turned on to catch all the snippets of English-accented dialog that I missed the first few times around.Rebecca Hall is perfectly cast as the spiritual medium- (read: con artist-) debunker who takes pity on the frightened children who think they've seen a ghost at a remote boys' boarding school. I didn't recognize the fine English/Irish actor Dominic West at first because I'd only seen him play an American in ""The Forgotten""; his accent in that movie sounded so natural to me as to seem native. Here he plays a history master who's seen a little too much of war's fickle cruelty. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, with Shaun Dooley a stand-out as a brutishly stern teacher with a hacking cough and a guilty conscience. Ever-present, lurking in the background, is the true horror of that age, World War I.But it's the young actor Isaac Hempstead Wright whom you'll remember above all the others, he of the haunted and haunting eyes. He almost made me believe in ghosts.There are a few moments that will make you jump in your seat, but this is not a gore-fest. The overall tone is somber, some of the action horrifying in its cruelty, but it's the psychological violence visited on the characters themselves that forms the core of the suspense of the film. In the end, all of the main characters have changed, some heartbreakingly so.I have to just mention here that I loved the device of the doll house.This is a film that will leave you with questions. If you're willing to play along, suspend disbelief, and take it at face value, you'll enjoy it. There are a couple of extras, interviews with the film's director/co-writer Nick Murphy, that are fun and enlightening.If you like eerily creepy haunted-house flicks on the order of ""The [original] Haunting,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Others,"" ""Haunted,"" ""The [original] Uninvited,"" and ""The Orphanage"" you should like this one.

1514400,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B006C0PPO8,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Everyone likes a good ghost story. The problem is, in film, there are too few to see. Not the case here.Here's the scoop. Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall), one of the few well educated women of her time (circa 1921) spends her waking hours exposing frauds in the psychic field. She's great at it. She also works to disprove the existence of ghosts and has written a book to that effect. She simply does not believe in anything beyond the here and now. She is summoned to a boarding school where there are rumors of a ghost that have the students frightened. She befriends one of the teachers, Robert Mallory (Dominic West), and she goes to work to get to the bottom of things. Problem is, the bottom is much deeper than either suspected.I'm going to say, up front, I liked this a lot better than most reviewers here. Some thought it slow. I would call it subtle. There were a few cheap jump scares, but mostly it was a slow burn to the end. I liked the way the clues built up little by little. I liked the gear she used to try to detect fraud. Lots of vintage techie items. And then there's the doll house. This sends the creep dial way up to 11. And her character arc I liked a lot. You get to see the reasons she's so against the thought of a world beyond ours and what happens to her when she realizes she might have to re-think things. There are other items not unlike those found in the films ""In he Dark Half"" and ""A Tale of Two Sisters,"" so when the hammer comes down, you're caught off guard and you need to reexamine the entire movie. The directing (Nick Murphy) was outstanding. He muted all the color tones so it underscored the era nicely. And he knows how to frame a shot. You could use most any scene as a wall hanging. He also used a couple of nifty camera tricks that added to the overall.Some argued the ending, but there were a couple so I'm not certain which one they didn't like.

1514401,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B006C0PPO8,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[1, 1]","What is it about England that makes it the perfect setting for ghost stories? Is it the rainy and bleak weather? The turn-of-the-century period d&eacute;cor has something to do with it I'm sure. From Sherlock Holmes mysteries to &#34;The Woman in Black&#34; and &#34;The Others,&#34; it seems Merry Ole England stands in the public eye as one of the most haunted countries in the world. BBC Films continues to feed this perception with the beautifully frightful &#34;The Awakening.&#34;The England of 1921 is suffering from the aftermath of World War I. Many people look to spiritualists for comfort by contacting those dead and missing through different occult avenues. Hoax exposer Florence Cathcart travels the country debunking charlatans who use rigged s&eacute;ances and elaborate trickery to fool the innocent looking for answers from the afterlife. The skeptical woman is hired to investigate the appearances of a ghost boy at a secluded boarding school in the countryside. After several attempts at pinning the specters on mischievous students, Cathcart fights to prove to herself that the supernatural events she's experiencing aren't real.It's evident that Director / Co-writer Nick Murphy had more on his mind when making &#34;The Awakening&#34; than what initially shows up on screen. He states in the extra features that the movie explores the reaction England had to the First World War and uses that as the basis for the events and attitudes of the characters. Florence Cathcart lost her belief in God or the afterlife because her fianc&eacute; was killed in the war. Almost everyone in the film was affected in some way by the war, whether it is directly or indirectly.Murphy used the time period to his advantage and created an effectively disturbing and gripping tale. It has some great twists and a wonderful setting in the quiet gray halls of an abandoned boarding house. Just don't expect the same types of jump-scares we get in Hollywood horror stories. &#34;The Awakening&#34; is sophisticated and provides its frights a little at a time.Every actor in &#34;The Awakening&#34; delivers a standout performance. Imelda Staunton does a fabulous job playing the over-protective and nervous housekeeper named Maud Hill. Rebecca Hall completely embraces her unbelieving character and shifts through a huge range of emotions with ease as Florence Cathcart.The DVD version of &#34;The Awakening&#34; contains deleted scenes with introductions by Director / Co-writer Nick Murphy. There's also a 25-minute featurette entitled &#34;A Time for Ghosts,&#34; which explores the setting and impact of historical events on the movie. It also delves into the history of spiritualism in England.Viewing &#34;The Awakening&#34; is as pleasurable an experience as you can have watching a gothic horror story. Everything you want in a classic ghost tale is present - a big dark house, suspicious characters, and spectral presences. It also offers many deeper reflections on life than what we get from most modern American horror films.",4,"Movie Review: ""The Awakening""",1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,3039,"['What', 'England', 'perfect', 'setting', 'ghost', 'stories', 'rainy', 'bleak', 'weather', 'turn-of-the-century', 'period', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'something', 'do', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'mysteries', '34', 'Woman', 'Black', '34', '34', 'Others', '34', 'Merry', 'Ole', 'England', 'public', 'eye', 'one', 'most', 'haunted', 'countries', 'world', 'BBC', 'Films', 'feed', 'perception', 'beautifully', 'frightful', '34', 'Awakening.', '34', 'England', '1921', 'suffering', 'aftermath', 'World', 'War', 'Many', 'people', 'look', 'spiritualists', 'comfort', 'contacting', 'dead', 'missing', 'different', 'occult', 'avenues', 'Hoax', 'exposer', 'Florence', 'Cathcart', 'country', 'debunking', 'charlatans', 'who', 'use', 'rigged', 's', 'eacute', 'ances', 'elaborate', 'trickery', 'fool', 'innocent', 'looking', 'answers', 'afterlife', 'skeptical', 'woman', 'hired', 'investigate', 'appearances', 'ghost', 'boy', 'secluded', 'boarding', 'school', 'countryside', 'several', 'attempts', 'pinning', 'specters', 'mischievous', 'students', 'Cathcart', 'prove', 'herself', 'supernatural', 'events', 'experiencing', 'are', ""n't"", 'real.It', 'evident', 'Director', '/', 'Co-writer', 'Nick', 'Murphy', 'had', 'more', 'mind', 'when', 'making', '34', 'Awakening', '34', 'what', 'initially', 'up', 'screen', 'extra', 'features', 'movie', 'reaction', 'England', 'had', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'basis', 'events', 'attitudes', 'characters', 'Florence', 'Cathcart', 'lost', 'belief', 'God', 'afterlife', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'was', 'killed', 'war', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'film', 'was', 'affected', 'way', 'war', 'directly', 'indirectly.Murphy', 'used', 'time', 'period', 'advantage', 'created', 'effectively', 'disturbing', 'gripping', 'tale', 'great', 'twists', 'wonderful', 'setting', 'quiet', 'gray', 'halls', 'abandoned', 'boarding', 'house', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'types', 'jump-scares', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'stories', '34', 'Awakening', '34', 'sophisticated', 'frights', 'little', 'time.Every', 'actor', '34', 'Awakening', '34', 'delivers', 'standout', 'performance', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'fabulous', 'job', 'playing', 'over-protective', 'nervous', 'housekeeper', 'named', 'Maud', 'Hill', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'completely', 'unbelieving', 'character', 'shifts', 'huge', 'range', 'emotions', 'ease', 'Florence', 'Cathcart.The', 'DVD', 'version', '34', 'Awakening', '34', 'contains', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'Director', '/', 'Co-writer', 'Nick', 'Murphy', 'also', '25-minute', 'featurette', 'entitled', '34', 'Time', 'Ghosts', '34', 'setting', 'impact', 'historical', 'events', 'movie', 'also', 'history', 'spiritualism', 'England.Viewing', '34', 'Awakening', '34', 'pleasurable', 'experience', 'can', 'have', 'watching', 'gothic', 'horror', 'story', 'Everything', 'want', 'classic', 'ghost', 'tale', 'present', 'big', 'dark', 'house', 'suspicious', 'characters', 'spectral', 'presences', 'also', 'many', 'deeper', 'reflections', 'life', 'what', 'get', 'most', 'modern', 'American', 'horror', 'films']",The Awakening

The film really isn't very frightening, which is its worst flaw but perhaps still central to its aesthetic: it's structured less as a horror work and more as a mood and a character piece. The house (a combination of several different Scottish houses filmed from different angles) is itself a major character, and is gorgeously photographed. Although she plays a character who could not have existed in 1921 as she is depicted (the gender roles of the era are flouted too much here), Rebecca Hall brings a dose of good common sense and humor to her part; Dominic West is perfectly cast as her romantic interest, a Latin teacher recovering from wounds from the Great War.

1514417,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B006C0PPO8,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[0, 0]","The Awakening follows Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall), a published author who also works on debunking and explaining supernatural phenomena. Robert Malory, a teacher, invites her to a boarding school where a ghostly child has been spotted to debunk the rumor. The Awakening is a great slow-burn drama/horror.I enjoyed the story in The Awakening. Sure, it's similar to other ghost stories- the rational skeptic that begins to question herself- but this film manages to stay interesting. It's not your typical haunted house, jump-scare thrill ride. It moves at a slow pace and plays out like a drama with horror elements. The horror is great, with a creepy setting and a few very effective and unexpected jump-scares. Be warned: it doesn't have many jump-scares, as it mostly relies on its creepy setting, suspense, and dialogue. Some parts of the ending were very predictable and some were a bit less, but the sense of ambiguity leaves the ending open for interpretation, which I like. Rebecca Hall did a great job as the lead, and so did the rest of the cast. The music was fantastic, as well.Overall, The Awakening is a great drama/horror film- a great story and a handful of scares. Jump-scare horror fans should be wary of its slow pace. As of 3/31/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a purchase is recommended for fans of slow burning horror films, a rental otherwise.The Awakening has strong violence and blood, some brief nudity.",4,A Great Slow-Burn Horror/Drama...,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,1449,"['Awakening', 'Florence', 'Cathcart', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'published', 'author', 'who', 'also', 'debunking', 'explaining', 'supernatural', 'phenomena', 'Robert', 'Malory', 'teacher', 'boarding', 'school', 'where', 'ghostly', 'child', 'been', 'spotted', 'debunk', 'rumor', 'Awakening', 'great', 'slow-burn', 'drama/horror.I', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'Awakening', 'Sure', 'similar', 'other', 'ghost', 'stories-', 'rational', 'skeptic', 'question', 'herself-', 'film', 'stay', 'interesting', 'not', 'typical', 'haunted', 'house', 'jump-scare', 'thrill', 'ride', 'slow', 'pace', 'out', 'drama', 'horror', 'elements', 'horror', 'great', 'creepy', 'setting', 'few', 'very', 'effective', 'unexpected', 'jump-scares', 'Be', 'warned', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'jump-scares', 'mostly', 'creepy', 'setting', 'suspense', 'dialogue', 'parts', 'ending', 'were', 'very', 'predictable', 'were', 'bit', 'less', 'sense', 'ambiguity', 'ending', 'open', 'interpretation', 'like', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'lead', 'so', 'did', 'rest', 'cast', 'music', 'was', 'fantastic', 'well.Overall', 'Awakening', 'great', 'drama/horror', 'film-', 'great', 'story', 'handful', 'scares', 'Jump-scare', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', 'be', 'wary', 'slow', 'pace', '3/31/13', 'film', 'available', 'Netflix', 'Streaming', 'purchase', 'recommended', 'fans', 'slow', 'burning', 'horror', 'films', 'rental', 'otherwise.The', 'Awakening', 'strong', 'violence', 'blood', 'brief', 'nudity']",The Awakening

The year is 1921, Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall, ""Iron Man 3"")  goes around to various cities and buildings where residents claim to have hauntings and through various methods she disproves these ""hauntings"".After a fairly well done opening sequence featuring some sort of seance summoning the ghost of a child, which turns out to be a major hoax. A man comes to her door and summons her to take care of another haunting so Florence goes to a boarding school in the town of Rookford. Here she is told about a ghost that scares the children of the school, some to death, she learns a certain someone who has died may be this ghost causing the problems. While attempting to show this as a hoax, things begin happening that make her question if this is actually a real ghost.""The Awakening"" has a pretty typical story, the England setting and locations are shown in a beautiful way but with some washed out and bleak look to it (capturing the time period well).

1514421,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B006C0PPO8,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","The time is 1921 and Florence Cathcart is a Cambridge-educated woman who spends her time debunking the spiritualism of the day--seances, ghost sightings, etc. She believes in science and facts and nothing else. She's even written a popular book about the subject. Her celebrity in demystifying what seems supernatural inspires a headmaster from Cumbria to recruit her. His boys' school is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a child murdered in the house before it became a school. The specter of a dead child has been terrifying the boys. One boy has died under the sort of mysterious circumstances that has frightened everybody. The school is about to have a holiday and the staff are worried the children won't come back.Florence reluctantly agrees to go to the school. She sets up her scientific equipment to find out what's going on. She soon uncovers the entirely mundane explanation for the child's death but some other unexplained things happen and she can't leave just yet. So she stays during the break to investigate further. A few school people remain with her.The movie delivers the typical chills for this kind of haunted house movie--creaky doors, glimpses of the specter just barely in frame, silent and slow exploration of the house in the dark, spooky toys, etc., much like The Woman in Black and The Others. I love this kind of horror. Even though I've seen most all the tricks before they still work on a visceral level.The overall story is interesting enough to keep me guessing at the solution or trying to anticipate twists, which I was not able to do. The performances also kept me engaged. Florence's smug know-it-all character is soon led away from her biases and becomes more vulnerable and relate-able. The ending is a little bit playful, like Inception's ending, but it didn't make me groan like Inception did.All in all, this movie is a solid B haunted house thriller that I would recommend.Parental advisory--in addition to the overall tension and menace of a horror film, there's also a discreet sex scene, some nudity from both sexes, some human-on-human violence with bloody wounds. Also, there's some boarding school discipline (a cane to the hand and to the backside).",3,Gives chills but nothing terribly new,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,2203,"['time', '1921', 'Florence', 'Cathcart', 'Cambridge-educated', 'woman', 'who', 'time', 'debunking', 'spiritualism', 'day', 'seances', 'ghost', 'sightings', 'etc', 'science', 'facts', 'nothing', 'else', 'even', 'written', 'popular', 'book', 'subject', 'celebrity', 'demystifying', 'what', 'supernatural', 'inspires', 'headmaster', 'Cumbria', 'recruit', 'boys', 'school', 'supposedly', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'child', 'murdered', 'house', 'became', 'school', 'specter', 'dead', 'child', 'been', 'terrifying', 'boys', 'One', 'boy', 'died', 'sort', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'frightened', 'everybody', 'school', 'have', 'holiday', 'staff', 'are', 'worried', 'children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'back.Florence', 'reluctantly', 'go', 'school', 'up', 'scientific', 'equipment', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'soon', 'entirely', 'mundane', 'explanation', 'child', 'death', 'other', 'unexplained', 'things', 'happen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'just', 'yet', 'break', 'investigate', 'further', 'A', 'few', 'school', 'people', 'remain', 'her.The', 'movie', 'typical', 'chills', 'kind', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'creaky', 'doors', 'glimpses', 'specter', 'just', 'barely', 'frame', 'silent', 'slow', 'exploration', 'house', 'dark', 'spooky', 'toys', 'etc.', 'much', 'Woman', 'Black', 'Others', 'love', 'kind', 'horror', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'tricks', 'still', 'work', 'visceral', 'level.The', 'overall', 'story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'guessing', 'solution', 'trying', 'anticipate', 'twists', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'do', 'performances', 'also', 'kept', 'engaged', 'Florence', 'smug', 'know-it-all', 'character', 'soon', 'led', 'away', 'biases', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'relate-able', 'ending', 'little', 'bit', 'playful', 'Inception', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'groan', 'Inception', 'did.All', 'movie', 'solid', 'B', 'haunted', 'house', 'thriller', 'would', 'recommend.Parental', 'advisory', 'addition', 'overall', 'tension', 'menace', 'horror', 'film', 'also', 'discreet', 'sex', 'scene', 'nudity', 'sexes', 'human-on-human', 'violence', 'bloody', 'wounds', 'Also', 'boarding', 'school', 'discipline', 'cane', 'hand', 'backside']",The Awakening

Allegedly based on ""true events"", the movie centers on Florence Caphart (Rebecca Hall), a ghost debunker in 1921 England.  She is commissioned to validate the presence of the ghost of a murdered boy in a prestegious boarding school.  Once there, she uncovers lies, deceit, and the possibility of truly supernatural activities.  Along with the debonair history professor (Dominic West) and the charming housemother (Imelda Staunton), Florence finds herself facing the frightening fact the ghost is real.Once you adjust to the movie's tempo, THE AWAKENING is an eerie ghost story although its twists and confusing resolution are frustrating.

1514462,A4FX5YCJA630V,B006C0PPO8,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[9, 16]","""The Awakening"" is a by-the-books ghost story, one which ticks all the requirements of the genre: a spooky atmosphere, a damaged heroine, tricky camera-work, and a last act twist. Though some plot-points may not hold up under close scrutiny, it does its job as watchable entertainment for the duration of its run time, carried by the strength of its lead actress and its moody, haunting ambience.An effective and sympathetic Rebecca Hall is Florence Cathcart, a professional ghost-hunter in 1920s England who exposes hoaxes and fraudulent con-artists seeking to capitalize on people's grief in the post-war environment. Having found some degree of notoriety with her latest book debunking spiritualism, she's hired by a boy's boarding school to investigate some bizarre goings-on. Once a private house, Rookford School is now filled with young school pupils, many of whom swear to have seen the ghost of a young boy with a distorted face in the upper corridors. The situation has reached crisis-level with the death of a pupil, presumably frightened to death after seeing the ghost during a trip to the latrine at night. Now the rest of the students are terrified, and parents are arriving en-masse to whisk them away.Assisted by teacher Robert Mallory and school matron Maud, Florence begins to investigate matters, only to find that - you guessed it - all her assumptions about the afterlife and the spirit world are called into question.Rebecca Hall grounds the story with her portrayal of a modern woman in a period film, using her intellect, cunning, and a range of photographic equipment to assess the situation and act accordingly. For the first half-hour it's an appealing depiction of a proactive, educated and well-respected heroine existing at a time when a woman wouldn't be expected to be any of these things - but unfortunately the characterization begins to go off-the-rails as the film goes on, with plenty of inexplicable behavior (Florence's reaction at catching the ghost on film is to immediately have sex with the guy standing next to her. I never knew ghost-hunting was such a turn-on) and the inclusion of an utterly pointless attempted rape scene. What is it with films believing that throwing in a gratuitous rapist that leaves their female protagonists bloody, disheveled and terrified somehow equals a rewarding subplot?Still, the actress is compelling enough to steer through the story's murky waters and her character's inconsistencies, and she's backed up nicely by solid supporting actors. The tiny cast is composed mainly of Dominic West as a teacher/war veteran/love interest (though don't ask me where his character's stutter went after the first act) and Imelda Staunton as the school nurse, both of whom have their own dark secrets.Yet plot-wise, there are some things that just don't add up. Someone gets locked in a bedroom at a crucial point for no clear reason. A character shows concern for another character that is unnecessary in retrospect. The groundskeeper subplot is completely superfluous. And Florence's backstory on her lover that died in the war doesn't really go anywhere or mean anything. The resolution is revealed in a lightning-quick montage that really could have used some better pacing for the audience to better absorb all the information, and it ends on an ambiguous note that I'm not really sure was *meant* to be that ambiguous.Make no mistake, the real draw-card of ""The Awakening"" is the acting and the cinematography. The entire film drips with an eerie formidability all throughout the large, cold rooms of the boarding house and its wooded grounds.  It's hard not to be drawn into its visual style, and the director makes good use of those familiar ""spooky icons"", whether they be doll-houses, creepy children, balls rolling down stairs, fuzzy photographs, or disturbing-looking toys that no child in their right mind would ever want to touch let alone play with. It's an immensely evocative film.But I can't really bring myself to give ""The Awakening"" more than three stars. Though the performances are strong and the build-up suspenseful, the story and characters are too convoluted and/or contrived to make this an absolute must-see. If you're in the mood for a pleasantly spooky film on a dark and stormy night, you could do worse than this.",3,"""There's Nothing...Nothing At All...""",1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,4313,"['Awakening', 'by-the-books', 'ghost', 'story', 'one', 'requirements', 'genre', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'damaged', 'heroine', 'tricky', 'camera-work', 'last', 'act', 'twist', 'plot-points', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'job', 'watchable', 'entertainment', 'duration', 'run', 'time', 'carried', 'strength', 'lead', 'actress', 'moody', 'haunting', 'ambience.An', 'effective', 'sympathetic', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Florence', 'Cathcart', 'professional', 'ghost-hunter', '1920s', 'England', 'who', 'hoaxes', 'fraudulent', 'con-artists', 'seeking', 'capitalize', 'people', 'grief', 'post-war', 'environment', 'Having', 'found', 'degree', 'notoriety', 'latest', 'book', 'debunking', 'spiritualism', 'hired', 'boy', 'boarding', 'school', 'investigate', 'bizarre', 'goings-on', 'private', 'house', 'Rookford', 'School', 'now', 'filled', 'young', 'school', 'pupils', 'many', 'whom', 'swear', 'have', 'seen', 'ghost', 'young', 'boy', 'distorted', 'face', 'upper', 'corridors', 'situation', 'reached', 'crisis-level', 'death', 'pupil', 'presumably', 'frightened', 'death', 'seeing', 'ghost', 'trip', 'latrine', 'night', 'Now', 'rest', 'students', 'are', 'terrified', 'parents', 'are', 'arriving', 'en-masse', 'whisk', 'away.Assisted', 'teacher', 'Robert', 'Mallory', 'school', 'matron', 'Maud', 'Florence', 'investigate', 'matters', 'only', 'find', 'guessed', 'assumptions', 'afterlife', 'spirit', 'world', 'are', 'called', 'question.Rebecca', 'Hall', 'story', 'portrayal', 'modern', 'woman', 'period', 'film', 'using', 'intellect', 'cunning', 'range', 'photographic', 'equipment', 'assess', 'situation', 'act', 'accordingly', 'first', 'half-hour', 'appealing', 'depiction', 'proactive', 'educated', 'well-respected', 'heroine', 'existing', 'time', 'when', 'woman', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'things', 'unfortunately', 'characterization', 'go', 'off-the-rails', 'film', 'plenty', 'inexplicable', 'behavior', 'Florence', 'reaction', 'catching', 'ghost', 'film', 'immediately', 'have', 'sex', 'guy', 'standing', 'next', 'never', 'knew', 'ghost-hunting', 'was', 'such', 'turn-on', 'inclusion', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'attempted', 'rape', 'scene', 'What', 'films', 'believing', 'throwing', 'gratuitous', 'rapist', 'female', 'protagonists', 'bloody', 'disheveled', 'terrified', 'somehow', 'rewarding', 'subplot', 'Still', 'actress', 'compelling', 'enough', 'steer', 'story', 'murky', 'waters', 'character', 'inconsistencies', 'backed', 'up', 'nicely', 'solid', 'supporting', 'actors', 'tiny', 'cast', 'composed', 'mainly', 'Dominic', 'West', 'teacher/war', 'veteran/love', 'interest', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'where', 'character', 'stutter', 'went', 'first', 'act', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'school', 'nurse', 'whom', 'have', 'own', 'dark', 'secrets.Yet', 'plot-wise', 'are', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'Someone', 'locked', 'bedroom', 'crucial', 'point', 'clear', 'reason', 'character', 'concern', 'character', 'unnecessary', 'retrospect', 'groundskeeper', 'subplot', 'completely', 'superfluous', 'Florence', 'backstory', 'lover', 'died', 'war', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'mean', 'anything', 'resolution', 'revealed', 'lightning-quick', 'montage', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'better', 'pacing', 'audience', 'better', 'absorb', 'information', 'ambiguous', 'note', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'was', '*meant*', 'be', 'ambiguous.Make', 'mistake', 'real', 'draw-card', 'Awakening', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'entire', 'film', 'drips', 'eerie', 'formidability', 'large', 'cold', 'rooms', 'boarding', 'house', 'wooded', 'grounds', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'visual', 'style', 'director', 'good', 'use', 'familiar', 'spooky', 'icons', 'be', 'doll-houses', 'creepy', 'children', 'balls', 'rolling', 'down', 'stairs', 'fuzzy', 'photographs', 'disturbing-looking', 'toys', 'child', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'touch', 'let', 'alone', 'play', 'immensely', 'evocative', 'film.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'give', 'Awakening', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'build-up', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'convoluted', 'and/or', 'contrived', 'make', 'absolute', 'must-see', ""'re"", 'mood', 'pleasantly', 'spooky', 'film', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'could', 'do', 'worse']",The Awakening
1514463,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B006C0PPO8,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea about THE AWAKENING.  This is, ultimately, a satisfactory but not classic ghost story.  The audience for this film wants a good story and some chills.  What they get is a film that delivers modest chills, a decent story and a layer of ambition not often found in a film of this sort.THE AWAKENING centers on Florence (Rebecca Hall, VICKY CHRISTINA BARCELONA), a young lady in 1920s England who makes her living exposing supernatural hoaxes.  (Much like Sigourney Weaver in the modern set RED LIGHT...an inferior film.)  She not only doesn't believe in ghosts and such, she doesn't believe in God either.  This melancholy woman is convinced to investigate a mysterious death at a boy's school.  The unfortunate child had claimed to have seen a ghost only shortly before meeting a rather unusual death.  The rest of the school is now living in fear that they are being stalked by a malevolent ghost of another boy who was murdered years before.Florence begins her investigation, and works closely with one of the teachers, a history teacher played by Dominic West.  I don't want to say much more, but the movie does have some nice surprises in store.  Again, nothing that redefines the genre...but it takes us into some unexpected places.The ""ambition"" I spoke of is the effort of the filmmakers to tie the events and characters and emotions of the film to the national psyche of Britain in these years just following World War I.  The film is essentially devoid of young men.  There are boys and there are older men who are physically and emotionally scarred by their time in the trenches.  This is a nation still grieving for the loss of so many to the war and the flu epidemic.  And this loss, this fear, this tenuousness informs the atmosphere of THE AWAKENING, and I appreciate the extra effort.In the end, it doesn't really matter than much, unfortunately.  It's a ghost story / mystery story.  It's a decent story, but the melancholy bleeds into the pace of the film as well, and it drags in portions.  It feels as though the same territory is gone over several times.  And then, when the final 15 minutes or so arrives, and the movie spills its secrets...the pace because breakneck, almost to the point of not quite being able to keep up.But I do recommend it overall.  This is not a ""scary"" film...it's a relative to films like THE ORPHANAGE, another moody ghost story.  (THE ORPHANAGE is superior...I only mean to roughly compare the tone and approach.)  I found Rebecca Hall and Dominic West to be very capable guides through the story.  Hall, as Florence, was an interesting character throughout, even when occasionally grating.  The terrific Imelda Staunton is on hand as well; although truthfully she isn't given much to do that stretches her.  This is a worthwhile film if you want mild creepiness, a decent mystery and don't mind a sometimes molasses pace.  I'd give the film 3.5 stars...but will round up to 4.",4,"3.5 stars for this mildy creepy, interesting but slow film",1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,2967,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'get', 'wrong', 'idea', 'AWAKENING', 'ultimately', 'satisfactory', 'not', 'classic', 'ghost', 'story', 'audience', 'film', 'good', 'story', 'chills', 'What', 'get', 'film', 'modest', 'chills', 'decent', 'story', 'layer', 'ambition', 'not', 'often', 'found', 'film', 'sort.THE', 'AWAKENING', 'centers', 'Florence', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'VICKY', 'CHRISTINA', 'BARCELONA', 'young', 'lady', '1920s', 'England', 'who', 'living', 'exposing', 'supernatural', 'hoaxes', 'Much', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'modern', 'set', 'RED', 'LIGHT', 'inferior', 'film', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghosts', 'such', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God', 'either', 'melancholy', 'woman', 'convinced', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'death', 'boy', 'school', 'unfortunate', 'child', 'had', 'claimed', 'have', 'seen', 'ghost', 'only', 'shortly', 'meeting', 'rather', 'unusual', 'death', 'rest', 'school', 'now', 'living', 'fear', 'are', 'being', 'stalked', 'malevolent', 'ghost', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'years', 'before.Florence', 'investigation', 'closely', 'one', 'teachers', 'history', 'teacher', 'played', 'Dominic', 'West', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'have', 'nice', 'surprises', 'store', 'Again', 'nothing', 'genre', 'unexpected', 'places.The', 'ambition', 'spoke', 'effort', 'filmmakers', 'tie', 'events', 'characters', 'emotions', 'film', 'national', 'psyche', 'Britain', 'years', 'just', 'following', 'World', 'War', 'film', 'essentially', 'devoid', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'boys', 'are', 'older', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'time', 'trenches', 'nation', 'still', 'grieving', 'loss', 'so', 'many', 'war', 'flu', 'epidemic', 'loss', 'fear', 'tenuousness', 'atmosphere', 'THE', 'AWAKENING', 'appreciate', 'extra', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'much', 'unfortunately', 'ghost', 'story', '/', 'mystery', 'story', 'decent', 'story', 'melancholy', 'bleeds', 'pace', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'portions', 'same', 'territory', 'gone', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'when', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'arrives', 'movie', 'secrets', 'pace', 'breakneck', 'almost', 'point', 'not', 'quite', 'being', 'able', 'keep', 'up.But', 'do', 'recommend', 'overall', 'not', 'scary', 'film', 'relative', 'films', 'ORPHANAGE', 'moody', 'ghost', 'story', 'ORPHANAGE', 'superior', 'only', 'mean', 'roughly', 'compare', 'tone', 'approach', 'found', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Dominic', 'West', 'be', 'very', 'capable', 'guides', 'story', 'Hall', 'Florence', 'was', 'interesting', 'character', 'even', 'when', 'occasionally', 'grating', 'terrific', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'hand', 'as', 'well', 'truthfully', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'want', 'mild', 'creepiness', 'decent', 'mystery', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sometimes', 'molasses', 'pace', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '3.5', 'stars', 'will', 'round', 'up', '4']",The Awakening

The nooks and shadows of the old estate, currently being used as a school, make good hiding places for indwelling spirits.The story had a few problems for me. The logic of the haunting didn't quite seem to hold. Then the ending, while intentionally trying to be a bit ambiguous, does steer the viewer to one specific interpretation. So, like the story itself, it lies betwixt and between - being neither quite misty enough, nor quite clear enough.There's also a problem with the main character. She transitions rather too quickly away from what would have been considered unseemly masculine assertiveness for the times. As the movie starts - she smokes, wears men's suits, and aggressively denounces s&eacute;ance charlatans. But soon after arriving at the school, she becomes susceptibly feminine in skirts and frilly blouses.However, this movie is still worthwhile as a mood piece. It chills you with those eeriest of elements - old nursery rhymes and dolls' houses. If you like low-key, thoughtful ghost stories without gore - this is the movie for you.It also has good extras.

A boarding school has begun to experience ghostly visions of dead children. A woman named Florence (Hall) is hired to come in and expose the hoax and put everyone's mind at rest. Little by little she begins to question herself. I have to say that this movie is very hard to review. It started off pretty slow then got more interesting then slowed down, then got scary, then slowed down, then had a great twist. The movie itself is OK but it was so inconsistent that I found it hard to pay attention to the entire time. After the ""Woman In Black"" movies like this have been taken to a new level and this would have been better if it came out before that one. The horror is very psychological and really more ""Shining"" like then anything. Overall, a movie worth seeing but be prepared for slow moments. I give it a C+.",3,A movie that is OK but not as good as Woman In Black. The horror is very Shining like and it is slow but worth seeing.

One day a teacher named Robert Malory (Dominic West) arrives, asking for her help. The students at his boarding school are all shocked at the mysterious death of a boy, believing that the strange incident has something to do with the ghost sightings in the school's premises.Florence is welcomed by a quiet housekeeper Maud (Imelda Staunton), who happens to be an admirer of Florence's book. Florence's scientific investigation takes an unexpected turn, however, leading her to the secrets hidden deep in the old school building.The supernatural thriller's story is set in 1921, only a few years after World War I ended.  Directed by Nick Murphy, ""The Awakening"" has a unique heroine, intelligent and strong-minded Florence Cathcart, who reminds us of Harry Houdini and his anti-spiritualist campaign. But is she secretly looking for evidences that prove the existence of afterlife?Unfortunately the film fails to offer a story this interesting protagonist really needs. Her psychological transformation is abrupt and doesn't convince (why doesn't she just leave anyway?); her romantic relationship is introduced too suddenly; and the truths that are revealed in the climax are simply incredible. About 40 minutes in, the film virtually stops telling us a story until the wrap-up that tries too hard to be clever.With powerhouse performances from Rebecca Hall and Imelda Staunton, as well as competent photography and production designs, ""The Awakening"" manages to entertain, and some scenes are genuinely creepy. If you are looking for more coherent story, this is not your film. ""The Awakening"" is a so-so UK horror you may enjoy as long as you ignore the story that goes out of control towards the ending.",3,Average UK Thriller with Powerful Acting from Rebecca Hall,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,1844,"['Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'Florence', 'Cathcart', 'author', 'supernatural', 'hoax', 'debunker', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'England', 'One', 'day', 'teacher', 'named', 'Robert', 'Malory', 'Dominic', 'West', 'asking', 'help', 'students', 'boarding', 'school', 'are', 'shocked', 'mysterious', 'death', 'boy', 'believing', 'strange', 'incident', 'something', 'do', 'ghost', 'sightings', 'school', 'premises.Florence', 'welcomed', 'quiet', 'housekeeper', 'Maud', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'who', 'be', 'admirer', 'Florence', 'book', 'Florence', 'scientific', 'investigation', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'however', 'leading', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'deep', 'old', 'school', 'building.The', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'story', 'set', '1921', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'ended', 'Directed', 'Nick', 'Murphy', 'Awakening', 'unique', 'heroine', 'intelligent', 'strong-minded', 'Florence', 'Cathcart', 'who', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'anti-spiritualist', 'campaign', 'secretly', 'looking', 'evidences', 'prove', 'existence', 'afterlife', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'offer', 'story', 'interesting', 'protagonist', 'really', 'psychological', 'transformation', 'abrupt', ""n't"", 'convince', 'why', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'anyway', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'introduced', 'too', 'suddenly', 'truths', 'are', 'revealed', 'climax', 'are', 'simply', 'incredible', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'virtually', 'telling', 'story', 'wrap-up', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'clever.With', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'as', 'well', 'competent', 'photography', 'production', 'designs', 'Awakening', 'entertain', 'scenes', 'are', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'coherent', 'story', 'not', 'film', 'Awakening', 'so-so', 'UK', 'horror', 'may', 'enjoy', 'as', 'long', 'ignore', 'story', 'control', 'ending']",The Awakening
