Then I was thrilled that they turned it into a film so it would ""live"" forever.  It's a superb script and basically a three-person cast, who pull it off with such dignity and aplomb.  Its themes are universal and the story unfolds beautifully.  Rent it, buy it...do anything.

Even though a harsher environment than the city, she would rather die with what she is familiar than in strange new place. John Denver turns in a great performance as their son. If you enjoy Hallmark movies you will love this one. Most Hallmark movies are pretty good, but Tandy and Cronyn made this and ""To Dance with the White Dog"", and they are excellent.

He plays a part of a father leading his family into the wilds of the unsettled west.  Not bad, but more like a kids tale.  I enjoyed it, as the kid in me has not left compltely yet. (am a senior citizen).  This is a nice story and makes you think of how it must have had sooo many hardships in the past, for our ancestors to endure.  Was worth the cost and worth seeing over and over again, even for the scenery. John is made to look much older but still looks a-okay.

Her dead husband is played by her real-life husband, Hume Cronyn. Both actors have passed away but their work is alive in many movies, including Foxfire. The basic plot is simple. Their son, played by the late, great singer John Denver, wants to convince his mother her best move is to leave her mountain home and live with him in Florida. During the movie we see flashbacks showing problems between father and son, but also a deep love for family and the mountains. Wonderful scenerey, the widow's refusal to leave the only home she's known and her husband's ghost, old-time ethics, and the running dialoge between the woman and her husband's ghost. I gave it three stars because of a bit too much ""aw-shawks"" to suit me, and songs not likely to be sung in a real Denver concert, but definitely worth watching this Hallmark Hall of Fame movie just for the pairing of Tandy and Cronyn.",3,A Fabulous Duo,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,977,"['fabulous', 'duo', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'husband', 'passed', 'away', 'still', 'around', 'ghost', 'dead', 'husband', 'played', 'real-life', 'husband', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'actors', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'work', 'alive', 'many', 'movies', 'including', 'Foxfire', 'basic', 'plot', 'simple', 'son', 'played', 'late', 'great', 'singer', 'John', 'Denver', 'convince', 'mother', 'best', 'move', 'leave', 'mountain', 'home', 'live', 'Florida', 'movie', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'showing', 'problems', 'father', 'son', 'also', 'deep', 'love', 'family', 'mountains', 'Wonderful', 'scenerey', 'widow', 'refusal', 'leave', 'only', 'home', 'known', 'husband', 'ghost', 'old-time', 'ethics', 'running', 'dialoge', 'woman', 'husband', 'ghost', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'aw-shawks', 'suit', 'songs', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'sung', 'real', 'Denver', 'concert', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'movie', 'just', 'pairing', 'Tandy', 'Cronyn']",Foxfire VHS
500932,A2A3RAZY9CZ85B,B00000G07E,"Susan ""Susie""","[6, 6]","Before I watched this movie I had a certain bias as Jessica Tandy is one of my favorite actors ever... But I wasn't dissappointed. This is an excellent Hallmark movie. The plot is Jessica Tandy plays a woman who has lived in a rural area in the mountains in the south all her life. Her son played by John Denver is urging her to sell and live with him to have an easier and safer life- she is 79. Annie Nations (Tandy) still talks to her husband Hector played by real life husband Hume Cronyn everday and seems content. But things start to happen. A developer is pushing Annie to sell her land, her son's (Denver) is having family issues, and she wants to be with her grandchildren. Casting John Denver in this was a good choice. His music really adds to the movie and the beauty of the mountains is something special. Foxfire shows the choices that at some point we have to make in life- saying goodbye to what is familiar and loved to live somewhere else, and knowing when to let go and start another part of your life. Jessica Tandy is so dignified and real as Annie Nations. She won a well deserved Emmy for this role. The family dynamics are very real and watching Foxfire is time well spent.",5,Foxfire an excellent movie,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,1197,"['watched', 'movie', 'had', 'certain', 'bias', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'ever', 'was', ""n't"", 'dissappointed', 'excellent', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'plot', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'rural', 'area', 'mountains', 'south', 'life', 'son', 'played', 'John', 'Denver', 'urging', 'sell', 'live', 'have', 'easier', 'safer', 'life-', '79', 'Annie', 'Nations', 'Tandy', 'still', 'husband', 'Hector', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'everday', 'content', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'developer', 'pushing', 'Annie', 'sell', 'land', 'son', 'Denver', 'having', 'family', 'issues', 'be', 'grandchildren', 'Casting', 'John', 'Denver', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'music', 'really', 'movie', 'beauty', 'mountains', 'something', 'special', 'Foxfire', 'choices', 'point', 'have', 'make', 'life-', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'what', 'familiar', 'loved', 'live', 'somewhere', 'else', 'knowing', 'when', 'let', 'go', 'start', 'part', 'life', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'so', 'dignified', 'real', 'Annie', 'Nations', 'won', 'well', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'role', 'family', 'dynamics', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'watching', 'Foxfire', 'time', 'well', 'spent']",Foxfire VHS
