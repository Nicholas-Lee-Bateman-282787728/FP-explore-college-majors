263450,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301736303,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Fighting Kentuckian, 1949 filmThis story is based on an historical fact. Frenchmen who supported Napoleon were exiled from France, Congress gave them land in Alabama as homes. The militia march through town (perhaps for the Creek War). They are dressed in buckskins, not military uniforms (more serviceable and cheaper). [The militia elected their officers.] John Breen is arrested for a bar fight (he supported Henry Clay). The militia arrived just in time, they march off singing. They present arms to a general of Napoleon. There is a wrestling contest for a gallon of Jamaican rum, and a free-for-all. A bugle ends the fighting. There is a song for entertainment. That night John Breen is advised to march away by a woman who is promised to another. Willy stays to watch John. [Note that old-fashioned bath tub!]John rides to a mansion to see Mademoiselle, but she isn&#8217;t home to him. He visits a tavern and learns how things are. Can he learn surveying quickly? [It is important to measure land accurately.] The singer tells her story and warns John about Hayden, the local powerful man. We learn about his scheme to grab developed land! Someone shoots at Breen as a threat and wounds him. Willy gives advice to John. They arrive at a party to play the fiddle. Is there a sour note? John gets a warning from Randolph and an offer to go away. The French General speaks to John Breen about his plans and the need for Blake Randolph&#8217;s help. The French Colonel asks for their land to be surveyed to check the boundaries. John overhears a conversation and learns about the land fraud. But the arrival of bad guys ends the conversation. John tells the General about the fraud. Breen isn&#8217;t a surveyor. Willy rides for help.The arrival of the Colonel saves Breen. The man who talked too much learns of the danger. Breen meets Florette, she refuses him. &#8220;That&#8217;s the way it is.&#8221; The French gather at the General&#8217;s house. There is a shooting and a chase [for action]. [Note the modern tire tracks on a dirt road.] Blake Randolph is also jailed. Will he be shot while trying to escape? John races after Hayden. The river men plan to attack the French settlers, horsemen against riflemen. Kentuckians ride to the battle in wagons. The river men ride off in retreat. And so there is a happy ending. [But what happened next?]This is a rare film because of the amount of comedy in what is a Western movie even if set east of the Mississippi. It is different from the usual movies that featured John Wayne, but not too different. The political climate was different too (the French settlers). [I didn&#8217;t know that.] There is a lot of US history that is censored from the schoolbooks, you have to search for it. The traditional Western dealt with the conflicts between big ranchers and small ranchers or homesteaders. Sometimes sheepmen too. There was always a love story added to round out its appeal, and often young children as well",3,Conflicts Over Love and Money,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,2972,"['Fighting', 'Kentuckian', '1949', 'filmThis', 'story', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'Frenchmen', 'who', 'supported', 'Napoleon', 'were', 'exiled', 'France', 'Congress', 'gave', 'land', 'Alabama', 'homes', 'militia', 'march', 'town', 'perhaps', 'Creek', 'War', 'are', 'dressed', 'buckskins', 'not', 'military', 'uniforms', 'more', 'serviceable', 'cheaper', '[', 'militia', 'elected', 'officers', ']', 'John', 'Breen', 'arrested', 'bar', 'fight', 'supported', 'Henry', 'Clay', 'militia', 'arrived', 'just', 'time', 'march', 'off', 'singing', 'present', 'arms', 'general', 'Napoleon', 'wrestling', 'contest', 'gallon', 'Jamaican', 'rum', 'free-for-all', 'bugle', 'fighting', 'song', 'entertainment', 'night', 'John', 'Breen', 'advised', 'march', 'away', 'woman', 'who', 'promised', 'Willy', 'watch', 'John', 'Note', 'old-fashioned', 'bath', 'tub', ']', 'John', 'mansion', 'see', 'Mademoiselle', 'isn', '8217', 'home', 'tavern', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'Can', 'learn', 'surveying', 'quickly', '[', 'important', 'measure', 'land', 'accurately', ']', 'singer', 'story', 'John', 'Hayden', 'local', 'powerful', 'man', 'learn', 'scheme', 'grab', 'developed', 'land', 'Someone', 'shoots', 'Breen', 'threat', 'Willy', 'advice', 'John', 'arrive', 'party', 'play', 'fiddle', 'there', 'sour', 'note', 'John', 'warning', 'Randolph', 'offer', 'go', 'away', 'French', 'General', 'speaks', 'John', 'Breen', 'plans', 'need', 'Blake', 'Randolph', '8217', 'help', 'French', 'Colonel', 'land', 'be', 'surveyed', 'check', 'boundaries', 'John', 'conversation', 'land', 'fraud', 'arrival', 'bad', 'guys', 'conversation', 'John', 'General', 'fraud', 'Breen', 'isn', '8217', 'surveyor', 'Willy', 'help.The', 'arrival', 'Colonel', 'Breen', 'man', 'who', 'talked', 'too', 'much', 'learns', 'danger', 'Breen', 'Florette', '8220', '8217', 's', 'way', '8221', 'French', 'gather', 'General', '8217', 's', 'house', 'shooting', 'chase', '[', 'action', ']', 'Note', 'modern', 'tire', 'tracks', 'dirt', 'road', ']', 'Blake', 'Randolph', 'also', 'jailed', 'Will', 'be', 'shot', 'trying', 'escape', 'John', 'races', 'Hayden', 'river', 'men', 'plan', 'attack', 'French', 'settlers', 'horsemen', 'riflemen', 'Kentuckians', 'ride', 'battle', 'wagons', 'river', 'men', 'ride', 'retreat', 'so', 'happy', 'ending', '[', 'what', 'happened', 'next', ']', 'rare', 'film', 'amount', 'comedy', 'what', 'Western', 'movie', 'even', 'set', 'east', 'Mississippi', 'different', 'usual', 'movies', 'featured', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'too', 'different', 'political', 'climate', 'was', 'different', 'too', 'French', 'settlers', '[', 'didn', '8217', 'know', ']', 'lot', 'US', 'history', 'censored', 'schoolbooks', 'have', 'search', 'traditional', 'Western', 'dealt', 'conflicts', 'big', 'ranchers', 'small', 'ranchers', 'homesteaders', 'Sometimes', 'sheepmen', 'too', 'was', 'always', 'love', 'story', 'added', 'round', 'out', 'appeal', 'often', 'young', 'children', 'well']",Fighting Kentuckian VHS

The date is 1819, the place Mobile, Alabama, and he plays John Breen, a member of the Second Kentucky militia, which has spent the last five years fighting the Seminoles and Creeks and is now on its way home--on foot, because local riverboat magnate Blake Randolph (John Howard) won't let it ride his craft.  Sighting Fleurette deMarchand (Vera Ralston), whom he doesn't know is Randolph's fiancee, he falls in love, and she returns the sentiment.  10 days later the Second arrives at Demopolis, a settlement created by exiled officers of Napoleon's forces and headed up by Fleurette's father.  There Breen arranges to stay on, and soon discovers that all is not as peaceful as it seems.  George Hayden (Grant Withers), who controls the rivermen, is conspiring with Randolph to eject the French from the land they have improved, but Randolph, influenced by a genuine fondness for Fleurette, is having second thoughts.  One-armed Col. Georges Giraud (Philip Dorn), one of deMarchand's most trusted followers, has suspicions that something isn't right.  And Hayden's mistress Ann Logan (Marie Windsor) is out to get revenge for her former fiance, who she believes was murdered by Hayden.  To achieve this end she fools everyone into thinking that Breen and his sidekick, rotund bugler and packmaster Willie Paine (Oliver Hardy), are surveyors come to check out the French grant lines.  Now Breen and Willie must convince deMarchand that his people's titles are in danger--to say nothing of their lives.Besides suspense, action, a generous sprinkling of humor, and an intriguing historical background (it isn't *exactly* accurate--look up ""Demopolis, Alabama"" on Wikipedia--but let's assume that this is a slightly alternative Universe), if you read the Production Notes included on the disc, you'll come away with an increased respect for Wayne as an actor.  Ralston (with whom he had worked four years earlier inDakota) was wished on him by her boyfriend, the head of Republic, who was determined to make a star of her, but she couldn't act and sometimes required as many as 15 takes to get a scene right.  Wayne not only conquers his natural dislike of such unprofessional behavior and makes a convincing lover of himself, he makes Ralston look good while he's at it.  This has been one of my favorites of the Duke's mid-career work ever since I discovered it on cable many years ago.

But he adds to the problems by pretending that he is a surveyor. He also finds out that there is a scheme afoot to defraud the French of some of their property by moving the posts that define the boundaries of the property.This flick is more than a love story. It pushes the American way over the then-European way. The American way is progressive and the European way is traditional. In the American way, women marry whomever they love and whomever they choose to marry. In the then-European way, women married according to arranged marriages.

Wayne is courtly and charming (nobody says &quot;ma'am&quot; like he does), and Oliver Hardy (showing off his native Georgian accent) is so adorable, I wanted to put him in my pocket.

Unfortunately, while the first project, &quot;Angel and the Badman&quot; was a great success, this movie bordered on disaster.In order to be given producing credit, DUKE had to hire the studio boss's girlfriend (Vera Ralston), to star opposite him. He knew she'd be no good for the picture, but DUKE's hands were tied.One problem with Vera Ralston was that she had a Czech accent. The role she was playing was supposed to be a French woman! In the end, all the French characters had to be cast with Czechs and other Eastern Europeans so Ralston's accent would not stand out. While not embarrassing herself too badly here, Ralston was not a real actress, and it shows.Oliver Hardy is great as DUKE's sidekick, although he was reluctant to do a project without his partner, Stan Laurel. Hardy had worked in a play with DUKE and John Ford just before filming began on &quot;The Fighting Kentuckian&quot;, and DUKE really wanted Hardy in his next project. Hardy only agreed after Laurel, ill at the time, talked him into it.There's quite a bit that's out of place here. Mixing the Louisiana river traders with French Army ex-patriots is a weird bit of psudo-history, made even more weird by the unlikely addition of the Kentucky Regiment that Wayne and Hardy are part of.DUKE is still DUKE, and Hardy is fun, but otherwise this overblown costume drama is not very memorable.The print Artisan used for the DVD transfer is pretty poor, too.

Laurel and Hardy had actually made their final American film, ""The Bullfighters,"" and were ""at liberty.""  By this time the comic team was frequently touring Europe and making live stage appearances, where they presented some new comic routines that were, unfortunately, never filmed.  They would eventually make one more film, in France: ""Utopia,"" also known as ""Atoll K.""John Wayne had a long-term contract with Republic pictures and, despite Wayne's increasing creative freedom, studio boss Herbert Yates insisted that Wayne use Vera Hruba Ralston in this historical comedy/drama.  Ralston had been a Czech ice skater who had fled her homeland when the Nazis came to power; she was beautiful and charming, as the film shows, and Yates fell in love with her, eventually marrying her.  Yates also insisted in putting Ralston in several of John Wayne's films at Republic.  Unfortunately, Ralston had a heavy accent.  This wasn't such a problem in this film because she was playing a member of the French aristocracy who was living with her countrymen in the southern United States in the early nineteenth century.  They had fled France following the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.The film has many of the classic elements of John Wayne's action films and is generally delightful.

Rivers,"[1, 1]","The inspired pairing of John Wayne and comedian Oliver Hardy, along with some memorable action sequences, elevate ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" (1949) to a higher level than most Republic Westerns. Wayne and Hardy work wonderfully together - it's markedly different from the Laurel and Hardy chemistry, but just as special. The only dead spot is a wooden and miscast Vera Hruba Ralston as Wayne's leading lady.",3,The Duke and Ollie Make a Splendid Team,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,406,"['inspired', 'pairing', 'John', 'Wayne', 'comedian', 'Oliver', 'Hardy', 'memorable', 'action', 'sequences', 'elevate', 'Fighting', 'Kentuckian', '1949', 'higher', 'level', 'most', 'Republic', 'Westerns', 'Wayne', 'Hardy', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'together', 'markedly', 'different', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'chemistry', 'just', 'special', 'only', 'dead', 'spot', 'wooden', 'miscast', 'Vera', 'Hruba', 'Ralston', 'Wayne', 'leading', 'lady']",Fighting Kentuckian VHS
