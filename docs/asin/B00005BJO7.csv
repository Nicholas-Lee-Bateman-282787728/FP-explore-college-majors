Enjoyed hearing him sing with his &#34;Mama.&#34; He definitely belongs on Broadway and anywhere else that anyone needs to hear the message of Jesus in song and by word of mouth.

The humor is fun and I feel like this is what religion and praising God should really be all about. If you don't get goosebumps listening to their 'tenor' you are tone deaf.
