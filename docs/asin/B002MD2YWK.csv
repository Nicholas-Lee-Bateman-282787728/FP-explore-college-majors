1278098,AYL9YUOBCDG5I,B002MD2YWK,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","The basic story is of a very prestigious all male school in Japan that has a rather odd custom. In order to inspire the student body to do its best (in sports and various activities) at least one first year student with pretty-boy looks is chosen to be a 'Hime' or princess. It just so happens that this year there are three such Hime and the story follows them around in their various tasks and events. If that was all the story was about it would be short and very boring but also the personal lives of the three Hime are explored. One is embarrassed to have to dress like a girl and is constantly worried about anyone outside of the school finding out about his 'job', while another has some issues with relating with his family that he needs to work out. The third Hime is an orphan that is trying his best (that he knows) to deal with a rather obsessed relative. The stories all deal with feelings or situations that most everyone (male/female) have dealt with in their life to some degree so I give it pluses for that. I also liked the fact many of the more obvious tropes and cliches are NOT explored in the series so again a thumbs up for the writer(s). Artwork is just okay, nothing ground breaking. For some relatively cheap and entertaining fun I have to recommend Princes*Princess Complete, but one word of warning for the homophobes out there, there is at least one Yaoi scene and others implied.",4,Princess Princess Complete,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,1409,"['basic', 'story', 'very', 'prestigious', 'male', 'school', 'Japan', 'rather', 'odd', 'custom', 'order', 'inspire', 'student', 'body', 'do', 'best', 'sports', 'various', 'activities', 'least', 'one', 'first', 'year', 'student', 'pretty-boy', 'looks', 'chosen', 'be', ""'Hime"", 'princess', 'just', 'so', 'year', 'are', 'three', 'such', 'Hime', 'story', 'around', 'various', 'tasks', 'events', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'short', 'very', 'boring', 'also', 'personal', 'lives', 'three', 'Hime', 'are', 'explored', 'One', 'embarrassed', 'have', 'dress', 'girl', 'constantly', 'worried', 'anyone', 'school', 'finding', 'out', ""'job"", 'issues', 'relating', 'family', 'work', 'out', 'third', 'Hime', 'orphan', 'trying', 'best', 'deal', 'rather', 'obsessed', 'relative', 'stories', 'deal', 'feelings', 'situations', 'most', 'everyone', 'male/female', 'have', 'dealt', 'life', 'degree', 'give', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'many', 'more', 'obvious', 'tropes', 'cliches', 'are', 'NOT', 'explored', 'series', 'so', 'again', 'thumbs', 'up', 'writer', 's', 'Artwork', 'just', 'okay', 'nothing', 'ground', 'breaking', 'relatively', 'cheap', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'have', 'recommend', 'Princes*Princess', 'Complete', 'one', 'word', 'warning', 'homophobes', 'there', 'least', 'one', 'Yaoi', 'scene', 'others', 'implied']",N/A

1278100,A2AVHD6ZEYOORK,B002MD2YWK,Lily,"[3, 3]","Okay so I've wtached plenty of yoai titles and this one seemed like more of a yuri because of the only moments they have seem to be when they're dressed up as females.Basically the story is about a school which take extremely feminine looking men and turn them into cross dressers. This tends to be funnier then it sounds as they spend most of their time running around and trying to convince one of them to continue to cross dress. The blond takes his job very seriously and claims that he has to do it anyways and he might as well do it right, besides smiling nad going with the flow allows for an easy job. The blue haired one is quite calm about all this and only wants it because of all the free stuff you get with it, meaning spending money and a free meal everyday. Meanwhile the red head openly admits that he hates it and will never like it, he revolts and riots all the time, so the two often spend their time calling him an idiot or dragging him off to get dressed.The series like most, make plenty attempts at trying to be funny. It doesnt always work in this one but they do have their moments. I did have quite a few laughs but I found myself watching it because I spent the money on it.I bought this at F.Y.E not on amazon.",3,Not the best,1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,1238,"['Okay', 'so', ""'ve"", 'wtached', 'plenty', 'yoai', 'titles', 'one', 'seemed', 'more', 'yuri', 'only', 'moments', 'have', 'seem', 'be', 'when', ""'re"", 'dressed', 'up', 'females.Basically', 'story', 'school', 'take', 'extremely', 'feminine', 'looking', 'men', 'turn', 'cross', 'dressers', 'be', 'funnier', 'then', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'running', 'around', 'trying', 'convince', 'one', 'continue', 'cross', 'dress', 'blond', 'job', 'very', 'seriously', 'claims', 'do', 'anyways', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'right', 'smiling', 'nad', 'going', 'flow', 'easy', 'job', 'blue', 'haired', 'one', 'quite', 'calm', 'only', 'free', 'stuff', 'get', 'meaning', 'spending', 'money', 'free', 'meal', 'everyday', 'Meanwhile', 'red', 'head', 'openly', 'will', 'never', 'riots', 'time', 'two', 'often', 'spend', 'time', 'calling', 'idiot', 'dragging', 'off', 'get', 'dressed.The', 'series', 'most', 'make', 'plenty', 'attempts', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'doesnt', 'always', 'work', 'one', 'do', 'have', 'moments', 'did', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'laughs', 'found', 'watching', 'spent', 'money', 'it.I', 'bought', 'F.Y.E', 'not', 'amazon']",N/A

1278103,AYX5FCONESYBQ,B002MD2YWK,Rick Dooley Sr.,"[14, 14]","I never would have bought this set just by reading the description , guys dressing up as girls at an all boys school ,blechh! . But I saw the trailer and thought I'd give it a chance since I like off the wall humor.If you like Ouran High School Host Club , you'll love this show , I personally think this show is better. This one is going on my list of favorites , it is very entertaining.The story is basically that the school chooses 3 first year students with pretty boy looks and make them princesses . The penalty for refusing ? The school flunks you . The rewards? Free lunch tickets, all school supplies and uniforms paid for , and cash from sales of princess photos .Oh and one other thing , if one drops out , they all get punished.I don't want to give away too much info . So if you like a good (yet implausible)story , great character development and a seriously funny series , then you should pick up this series ,you'll get a lot of entertainment for a cheap price.
