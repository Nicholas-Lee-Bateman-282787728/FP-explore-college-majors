940045,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000BC8SVA,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","There is no question that the search for roots that drove a lot of the early 1960s folk minute (obviously it was more than a minute but not by much as it got squeezed in between the classic Elvis/Chuck/Bo/Jerry Lee rock and roll of the 1950s and the subsequent Beatles/Stones British invasion/Jefferson Airplane/Dead acid rock drown out) that drove a lot of us to seek out that kind of music had a receptive audience among my generation, the generation of &#8217;68 as I like to call it. Exploring the music not of ours parents well-known from around the house and a feature of Saturday night radio listening, or of insipid Tin Pan Alley tunes once the music died, the classic rock and roll music of the mid 1950s in the late 1950s but from the American mountains, from traditional Child-like ballads, from the Jehovah black and white Pentecostal churches, from the blues-ridden south (and the later equally-blues-ridden north industrial cities).Yes, we drank deeply from those new sounds to our ears, as some of us became amateur singers and musicians (if only to impress some young man or woman who might look our way if we knew three chords and could sing not too far off key) and frequented the coffeehouses and other venues that sprang up to feed our new-found passion. And while there were others, each summer for a few years we would go like lemmings to the sea to Newport, Rhode Island for the annual &#8220;max daddy&#8221; folk festival which is the subject of the documentary under review, Festival.The beauty of the Newport Folk Festival then, from the period covered by the documentary, 1963-1966 (or now for that matter since after a fairly long hiatus the event has been revived), was that you could find, depending on your schedule every kind of non-popular music or other expression from blues to zydeco. The beauty of this documentary is that it takes many, many performances from those years and lets the music drive the thing with only an occasional &#8220;talking head&#8221; telling us what it meant. And for the one hour and one half of the film we are basically transported back to a time when young people (mostly) were willing to sleep in every nook and cranny in order to survive that weekend of music, to make music in the workshops, and to provide the audience for the &#8220;name&#8221; musicians on the main stage.Of course any mention of the folk minute of the early 1960s requires some homage to the crowned king and queen of the folk scene then, Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. And as main-line head-liners they got a fair share of the film but along the way there are snippets and full performances by virtually all the heavy-hitters of the times, performers like ancient Pete Seeger, Odetta, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Donovan, Judy Collins, Richard and Mimi Farina, you name it. But also blues legends, John Hurt, Son House, Howling Wolf; mountain music&#8217;s Hobart Smith, Cousin Emmy and others; clap-dancers; drum and fifers (who really worked up a sweat); Johnny Cash and various groups formed around the freedom struggle for black civil rights struggle down South that was intimately linked to the folk scene. Great stuff. Sadly many of those performers, especially those who were a little older have passed on and their passing kind of added a solemn tinge to viewing this piece of musical history.

940046,A278BQVTXK999P,B000BC8SVA,Barry Smith,"[28, 30]","Before Woodstock, before Isle of Wight, before Monterey Pop, music fans of the early 60s went to Rhode Island for the Newport Folk Festival, a series of annual summer concerts featuring the best of the folk music scene.  Murray Lerner and various other movie crews were on hand from 1963-1966 to film the musicians, the audience, and the interactions of the two groups. FESTIVAL captures this interaction well over the course of the film.  However, one significant interaction exists throughout which seems to be the true focus of FESTIVAL: the old folkies versus the young upstarts.  Whereas the original festival concept was to showcase the traditional folk acts (such as Pete Seeger, Peter Paul & Mary, square dancers and various gospel singers), a younger audience began to emerge onto the folk scene, cultivating their own tastes and styles, and moving towards a more rebellious attitude. Their heroes were more outspoken personalities such as Johnny Cash, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.  Still, this is the pre-hippie era, so even the most rebellious kids tend to keep their hair short and their dress conservative.  But things were about to change. FESTIVAL succeeds in capturing this era of transition, and many of the interviews with the performers and the young fans are priceless. There is one group of college age kids who comment on Bob Dylan's performance.  I can't believe how much they resemble kids of today, from their pompous attitude, their fondness for longish hair, cigarettes, beer, and having a party.  Obviously many of today's attitudes were already taking shape back in the early 60s.As a concert film, FESTIVAL succeeds as well.  Although some acts are indeed edited, this problem isn't annoying as others have stated.  The film shows quite many performers, but all the music is real good.  Near the end, you see Newport's most famous moment of controversy... Bob Dylan's electric performance of ""Maggie's Farm.""  Bob Dylan is the superstar of Newport.  All the musicians played his tunes (mostly in acoustic format) and the fans scrutinized everything he did.  But Dylan's biggest function in this movie is this: he had brought the young music fans rock music into the folk scene (and making it a legitimate art form).  The traditional folkies booed Dylan, but a new generation  embraced him, and they were about to break away and organize festivals of their own, ones which were louder and more controversial. Monterey Pop took place in 1967 and the big one.... Woodstock was lurking at the end of the decade.FESTIVAL is a great document of American music in transition, and a fun film for music lovers of various tastes.  The footage is in black and white but it's a film of many cool colors and styles.",5,Pre-Woodstock festival in beautiful b&w,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,2728,"['Woodstock', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'music', 'fans', 'early', '60s', 'went', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Newport', 'Folk', 'Festival', 'series', 'annual', 'summer', 'concerts', 'featuring', 'best', 'folk', 'music', 'scene', 'Murray', 'Lerner', 'various', 'other', 'movie', 'crews', 'were', 'hand', '1963-1966', 'film', 'musicians', 'audience', 'interactions', 'two', 'groups', 'FESTIVAL', 'interaction', 'well', 'course', 'film', 'However', 'one', 'significant', 'interaction', 'exists', 'be', 'true', 'focus', 'FESTIVAL', 'old', 'folkies', 'young', 'upstarts', 'original', 'festival', 'concept', 'was', 'showcase', 'traditional', 'folk', 'acts', 'such', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'square', 'dancers', 'various', 'gospel', 'singers', 'younger', 'audience', 'began', 'emerge', 'folk', 'scene', 'cultivating', 'own', 'tastes', 'styles', 'moving', 'towards', 'more', 'rebellious', 'attitude', 'heroes', 'were', 'more', 'outspoken', 'personalities', 'such', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Still', 'pre-hippie', 'era', 'so', 'even', 'most', 'rebellious', 'kids', 'tend', 'keep', 'hair', 'short', 'dress', 'conservative', 'things', 'were', 'change', 'FESTIVAL', 'capturing', 'era', 'transition', 'many', 'interviews', 'performers', 'young', 'fans', 'are', 'priceless', 'one', 'group', 'college', 'age', 'kids', 'who', 'comment', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'resemble', 'kids', 'today', 'pompous', 'attitude', 'fondness', 'longish', 'hair', 'cigarettes', 'beer', 'having', 'party', 'Obviously', 'many', 'today', 'attitudes', 'were', 'already', 'taking', 'shape', 'back', 'early', '60s.As', 'concert', 'film', 'FESTIVAL', 'as', 'well', 'acts', 'are', 'indeed', 'edited', 'problem', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'film', 'quite', 'many', 'performers', 'music', 'real', 'good', 'end', 'see', 'Newport', 'most', 'famous', 'moment', 'controversy', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'electric', 'performance', 'Maggie', 'Farm', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'superstar', 'Newport', 'musicians', 'played', 'tunes', 'mostly', 'acoustic', 'format', 'fans', 'scrutinized', 'everything', 'did', 'Dylan', 'biggest', 'function', 'movie', 'had', 'brought', 'young', 'music', 'fans', 'rock', 'music', 'folk', 'scene', 'making', 'legitimate', 'art', 'form', 'traditional', 'folkies', 'booed', 'Dylan', 'new', 'generation', 'embraced', 'were', 'about', 'break', 'away', 'organize', 'festivals', 'own', 'ones', 'were', 'louder', 'more', 'controversial', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'took', 'place', '1967', 'big', 'one', 'Woodstock', 'was', 'lurking', 'end', 'decade.FESTIVAL', 'great', 'document', 'American', 'music', 'transition', 'fun', 'film', 'music', 'lovers', 'various', 'tastes', 'footage', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'many', 'cool', 'colors', 'styles']",N/A

It does actually include quite a few full length songs from Peter, Paul and Mary, as well as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.The SOUND in this Dvd is fantastic considering how and when it was recorded, I was really happy with how clear and strong the audio was. Anyone who expects perect surround sound from a 60's festival is unrealistic. The sound has been done superbly.The VIDEO is again above par considering the date of the event, there are multiple cameras which give some fantastic close ups of all the artists, black and white.THe are really no EXTRAS which was a dissapointment.To CONCLUDE for the price I would not hesitate in buying this dvd if you are a fan of the music and scene in question and want some great clips of dozens and dozens of great artists as well as full length from a few, notibly Peter, Paul and MAry and Bob Dylan. If the released a multi DVD set including every piece of video footage they had for 50 dollars I would buy it but that was not the purpose of this DVD.

What makes this year's show so special is that the two co-founders of the festival (producer George Wein and the legendary folk icon Pete Seeger, who just turned 90!) return to Newport with an impressive lineup of talent.  I hope to be there!  In 1963,  The Newport Folk Festival presented what most folkies consider to be the most remarkable festival ever.  Included on the bill that year were such groundbreaking performers as Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, The Staple Singers, Pete, Paul & Mary, Donovan and of course Pete Seeger who seems to pop up everywhere in this show.  Thank goodness that someone way back then (Murray Lerner)  had the great good sense to record the entire show for posterity.  Unfortunately, nothing was done with this remarkable footage until 2005  when Eagle Vision Media finally released the 97 minute B & W documentary simply called ""Festival!""  This is as significant a piece of American musical history as you are going to find anywhere.  To my way of thinking this one blows ""Woodstock"" away.In ""Festival!"" not only you do get to see all of the aformentioned big names perform but you also get a rare opportunity to sample the handiwork of some incredible acts that you might not be familiar with such as the bluegrass legends The Osborne Brothers, veteran bluesmen Son House and Mississippi John Hurt and the incredible gospel offerings of the Georgia Sea Island Singers.  Meanwhile, there are short interviews with some of the performers and with members of the audience as well.  It is quite apparent that something revolutionary was bubbling beneath the surface and that very soon the times would be a-changing.There are so many remarkable performances in this film that I really don't know where to begin.  For me the best of the bunch is Dylan performing ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and a very young Johnny Cash singing his first big hit ""I Walk The Line"".  But for me the most poignant moment has to be Peter, Paul & Mary performing ""Blowin"" In The Wind"".  It is so apparent that these three people passionately believe in what they are singing about.  More than four decades later Peter Paul & Mary are still ""walkin' the walk"" for the causes they believe in.As I indicated earlier ""Festival!"" is one of the most remarkable concerts you will ever see.  The musical and historical significance of this show cannot be underestimated.  What Murray Lerner was able to accomplish by chronicling this event for us is priceless.

The musicians, the themes, the dawning of a completely different (we thought) era.  But listen to the kids in the interviews, and look at the footage. This is pre-San Francisco, wear some flowers in your hair.  These are the college students who went to Mississippi on voters' rights marches, these are the people who REALLY thought that music could change the world.  And maybe they were right -- folk music, blues, protest songs, Appalachian clogging, it's all in the same big basket, and it all deserved our attention.

940054,A268WAQS5WNMGJ,B000BC8SVA,Thomas B. Gross,"[39, 50]","I ordered this impulsively when it became available - for some reason I thought it would be worth owning at the price ($10) but even that cheap it's really not a keeper.It's somewhat reminiscent of the Evening Concert Anthology LPs that Vanguard produced in the Sixties from the Newport Festivals in that, given the diversity of folk genres represented, very few people are going to be interested in all the music although a few performances might be to one's taste.  That was always a problem with ""festivals"" in the Folk Era: fans of Lativan folk music had to sit through performances of Muddy Waters (and vice versa).This particular film suffers from the fact that it mixes performances from four years of Newport festivals starting in 1963: a lot changed in popular music and in contemporary events during that time and it's up to the viewer to figure out that the ""youth"" who is worried about ""the bomb"" is not yet worried about the draft.Thus I can only guess that the most provocative moment in this film is probably at a ""Topical Song"" workshop where Bob Dylan appears at the end of the show and sings only ""All I Really Wanna Do (is Baby be friends with you...)"" which is anything but a protest song, and was probably exactly his point.  Similarly his electric performances are presented in this film as just another genre of folk music.It's easy to see why Scorcese used outtakes and longer excerpts from the production of this film.  As others have mentioned, I found it very frustrating that only 15-20 seconds of Spider John Koerner is included, and only the last verse of Judy Collins singing ""Anathea"" (a song which is kind of a guilty pleasure for me personally).",2,"Really not worth owning, despite the price",1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1679,"['ordered', 'impulsively', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'reason', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'owning', 'price', '10', 'even', 'cheap', 'really', 'not', 'keeper.It', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Evening', 'Concert', 'Anthology', 'LPs', 'Vanguard', 'produced', 'Sixties', 'Newport', 'Festivals', 'given', 'diversity', 'folk', 'genres', 'represented', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'interested', 'music', 'few', 'performances', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'taste', 'was', 'always', 'problem', 'festivals', 'Folk', 'Era', 'fans', 'Lativan', 'folk', 'music', 'had', 'sit', 'performances', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'vice', 'versa', 'particular', 'film', 'suffers', 'fact', 'mixes', 'performances', 'four', 'years', 'Newport', 'festivals', 'starting', '1963', 'lot', 'changed', 'popular', 'music', 'contemporary', 'events', 'time', 'up', 'viewer', 'figure', 'out', 'youth', 'who', 'worried', 'bomb', 'not', 'yet', 'worried', 'draft.Thus', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'most', 'provocative', 'moment', 'film', 'probably', 'Topical', 'Song', 'workshop', 'where', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'end', 'show', 'only', 'Really', 'Wan', 'Do', 'Baby', 'be', 'friends', 'anything', 'protest', 'song', 'was', 'probably', 'exactly', 'point', 'Similarly', 'electric', 'performances', 'are', 'presented', 'film', 'just', 'genre', 'folk', 'music.It', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Scorcese', 'used', 'outtakes', 'longer', 'excerpts', 'production', 'film', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'found', 'very', 'frustrating', 'only', '15-20', 'seconds', 'Spider', 'John', 'Koerner', 'included', 'only', 'last', 'verse', 'Judy', 'Collins', 'singing', 'Anathea', 'song', 'kind', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'personally']",N/A
