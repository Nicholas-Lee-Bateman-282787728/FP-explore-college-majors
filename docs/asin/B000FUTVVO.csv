996637,A3VEOBMVEIG6VR,B000FUTVVO,Nisha,"[0, 0]","I've seen this movie on lifetime... I really enjoyed this film, but never saw the beginning of this movie ... It surprised me at the beginning of the credits that Jennie Garth co-produced the film. I wonder is this the only film she's co-produced or are there others ones? ... I do think she is a beautiful good actress. I wish though, that the time she was seducing the son that there would have been more scenes where she's being more manipulative whether to the son or the rest of the family before it leads to the finale. I did like the last scene but, I do think the very ending could have been a lot better.I kind of wish she would have gotten away with it all, I think that would have made the whole movie more intriguing.Nevertheless, its a movie i will watch over and over again ... If anyone enjoyed this movie then I really think ya'll will enjoy DREAM LOVER starring James Spader and Madchen Ammick ,... Very good movie with two very talented beautiful actors in this film... their performances are amazing in this film is outstanding, their chemistry is great... and Madchen is amazing at acting as the seductive, very manipulative, calculating character in the film.... This by the way is another film in which I think it would have been great  if  ** SPOILER ALERT** ... Lena (madchen's character) had not gotten away with it all .... But yet again if you see this film, you may feel way more sympathetic for (spaders character) which I did, so I also do like the way the movie ends in this dreamlike scene...",5,an unfinished affair ...,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,1524,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'lifetime', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'never', 'saw', 'beginning', 'movie', 'surprised', 'beginning', 'credits', 'Jennie', 'Garth', 'co-produced', 'film', 'wonder', 'only', 'film', 'co-produced', 'are', 'others', 'ones', 'do', 'think', 'beautiful', 'good', 'actress', 'wish', 'time', 'was', 'seducing', 'son', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'scenes', 'where', 'being', 'more', 'manipulative', 'son', 'rest', 'family', 'finale', 'did', 'last', 'scene', 'do', 'think', 'very', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'kind', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'whole', 'movie', 'more', 'intriguing.Nevertheless', 'movie', 'i', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'anyone', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'then', 'really', 'think', 'ya', ""'ll"", 'will', 'enjoy', 'DREAM', 'LOVER', 'starring', 'James', 'Spader', 'Madchen', 'Ammick', 'Very', 'good', 'movie', 'two', 'very', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'actors', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'amazing', 'film', 'outstanding', 'chemistry', 'great', 'Madchen', 'amazing', 'acting', 'seductive', 'very', 'manipulative', 'calculating', 'character', 'film', 'way', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', '**', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT**', 'Lena', 'madchen', 'character', 'had', 'not', 'gotten', 'away', 'yet', 'again', 'see', 'film', 'may', 'feel', 'way', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'spaders', 'character', 'did', 'also', 'do', 'way', 'movie', 'dreamlike', 'scene']",An Unfinished Affair
