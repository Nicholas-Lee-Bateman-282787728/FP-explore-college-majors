This is a movie you can recommend to families without any reservations.  There are many teachable moments in it and some real heart wrenching moments that will move you to tears and laughter.  I recommend it for all ages.,5,Season of Miracles,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,304,"['ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'rest', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'can', 'recommend', 'families', 'reservations', 'are', 'many', 'teachable', 'moments', 'real', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'moments', 'will', 'move', 'tears', 'laughter', 'recommend', 'ages']",N/A

Seldom have I ever been so happy to have an opportunity to review a product like this.  It is a film that will certainly be deemed a classic.  This is a beautiful film that has all the charm and grace associated with the time period and location where it takes place.  The deep South in the '70s.  Don't let the location and decade put you off as Season of Miracles is a film that will appeal to all ages and in all parts of the nation.  Especially if you like faith films and enjoy sports of any kind.  The sport in this case is little league baseball and whatever you think of the game today, the sweet innocence of what we once considered The American Game is there.  I don't want to be a spoiler, as too often happens with reviewers, however I have to say that redemption is a major theme.  There is a great emphasis on that as well as family, justice and love.  The topic of autism is also very much involved.  The kids are all superb in acting, however I will just mention four adults in particular.  Rusty Whitener wrote both the original book and screenplay and in this film proves himself to be a first rate actor.  Also excellent jobs are turned in by Nancy Stafford, Sandra Williams Van Natta and John Schneider who may be most familiar for his work in Smallville and Dukes of Hazzard.  These four serve as a backbone for the kids involved and add greatly to the film.  One further proof I can give is that I have seen the film five times in special screenings.  It was as enjoyable the last time as it was the first.  I have to add that I last saw it in a special presentation in a jam packed theater and for the first time ever saw a standing ovation at the conclusion of the movie.  You will definitely want to buy this.  And there is good news that must be added.  Rusty Whitener has written a sequel, Season of Mysteries, and this too has the makings of a great motion picture.",5,Definitely will be deemed a classic.,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2039,"['People', 'who', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'read', 'reviews', 'may', 'know', 'ever', 'beginning', 'company', 'have', 'reviewed', 'books', 'films', 'merchandise', 'Seldom', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'so', 'happy', 'have', 'opportunity', 'review', 'product', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'deemed', 'classic', 'beautiful', 'film', 'charm', 'grace', 'associated', 'time', 'period', 'location', 'where', 'place', 'deep', 'South', ""'70s"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'location', 'decade', 'put', 'off', 'Season', 'Miracles', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'ages', 'parts', 'nation', 'Especially', 'like', 'faith', 'films', 'enjoy', 'sports', 'kind', 'sport', 'case', 'little', 'league', 'baseball', 'think', 'game', 'today', 'sweet', 'innocence', 'what', 'once', 'considered', 'American', 'Game', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoiler', 'too', 'often', 'reviewers', 'however', 'have', 'say', 'redemption', 'major', 'theme', 'great', 'emphasis', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'justice', 'love', 'topic', 'autism', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'involved', 'kids', 'are', 'superb', 'acting', 'however', 'will', 'just', 'mention', 'four', 'adults', 'particular', 'Rusty', 'Whitener', 'wrote', 'original', 'book', 'screenplay', 'film', 'be', 'first', 'rate', 'actor', 'Also', 'excellent', 'jobs', 'are', 'turned', 'Nancy', 'Stafford', 'Sandra', 'Williams', 'Van', 'Natta', 'John', 'Schneider', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'familiar', 'work', 'Smallville', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'four', 'serve', 'backbone', 'kids', 'involved', 'add', 'greatly', 'film', 'One', 'further', 'proof', 'can', 'give', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'five', 'times', 'special', 'screenings', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'first', 'have', 'add', 'last', 'saw', 'special', 'presentation', 'jam', 'packed', 'theater', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'standing', 'ovation', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'buy', 'good', 'news', 'must', 'be', 'added', 'Rusty', 'Whitener', 'written', 'sequel', 'Season', 'Mysteries', 'too', 'makings', 'great', 'motion', 'picture']",N/A

Besides John Schneider and Grayson Russell, the acting was not very good, and the production wasn't professional.
