This animation is as refined an artwork as the best paintings in the Louve, a work of a fanaticly dedicated team to make the best they possibly can.  IMHO, it's worth it for all the movie tributes alone, though the storytelling is excellent and the artwork of course fantastic.  Furthermore, the art has a ""Retro"" feel, like the 50's, the beatnicks, ""Postmodern Impressionism"" I think.My favs are the ""Samurai Jack at the Rave"" episode, a parody of the early ""Evils of Rock Music brainwashing our kids"" fictions.  And the ""Haunted House"" one with the tip of the hat to ""The Ring"" involving Jack fighting an ancient Oni who hasn't fought a samurai in aeons and when it seems to win it forgets a critical thing about samurai.  (How far into the future is this?  The mystery is better than any specific date.)

During a climatic battle between Aku and the samurai, Aku sends the young samurai through a time portal into the far future where Aku rules the Earth. Called ""Samurai Jack"" by the inhabitants of this future world, he seeks a way to return to the past and undo Aku's horrible deeds while battling Aku and his evil minions.Includes:Chicken Jack (JACK is turned into a chicken), Jack and the Rave-Slaves (Jack vs. an evil DJ),The GOOD, THE BAD and THE BEAUTIFUL (Jack vs. Bounty-hunters old-west style), Jack & the ZOMBIES (super-fight in a graveyard), JACK in EGYPT (young Jack), JACK and the TRAVELING CREATURES, JACK & THE HAUNTED HOUSE, JACK, the MONKS and THE ANCIENT MASTER'S SON, JACK and the 3 GEMS, JACK & THE LABYBRINTH.The series won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2004 (it was also nominated in 2002 and 2005) - and artists Scott Willis, Dan Krall and Bryan Andrews received Emmys for Outstanding Individual Achievement In Animation for their work on the series. Beautifully animated, the series makes you feel as if you are looking a high-action, high-color woodcut prints, scored with music both modern and ancient, both electric and serene.

972172,A1ZCYC0RHTRMZF,B000EGDAFC,"Kristin J. Johnson ""Three-time published author""","[1, 1]","No sophomore slump for Jack--the concept would be anathema to him.  We get introduced to tons more marvelous characters.  It is difficult to name favorites, because I've seen them all repeatedly.  Above all though Samurai Jack is composed of moments.  There's an aesthetic here, whether it consists of Aku asserting his dominion with just a look (just before he unleashes the laser beams) or Jack smiling at the beauty of the forest in Episode XXIII.Genndy has created that rare world where we both don't want to live in it and yet are fascinated to escape to it.  The earth ruled by Aku has its own logic that's as complex as the hero and villain.  I personally wouldn't mind traveling with the Traveling Creatures, or stopping for an Aku-burger in the Central Hub, or hanging at the inn with the kindly innkeeper and his daughter.  Even though Jack may hate his time, we love watching the silently eloquent Samurai interact with his world.  Since Jack and Aku both get flustered by unexpected wackiness (Jack with the chicken and the creature, Aku way back in Season 1 with the children), it's amusing to put them against quirky characters.  I could almost wish Aku had had more interaction other than ""you will bow to me"" with his subjects, but that's not his personality.Yes, Aku is completely evil from birth, which we see the minute after being ""born"" when he taunts Jack's father.  But you wouldn't do Jack any favors by giving him a buffoon.  For Jack's quest to be believable, the villain has to be smart, tough, all-powerful, completely loathsome and yet utterly compelling.  It helps that Aku is voiced by the marvelous Mako, who invented such a unique accent and speech pattern for a completely unforgettable villain.  Aku is marvelously seductive even in his Armageddon moments, and always watchable when he's being foolish.  It's hysterical to watch Aku, as the grumpy old wizard, try to fool Jack again.  His arrogance proves to be his fatal flaw, not to mention his vanity--how many statues and architectural tributes does the guy need?As an aside, I always thought it would be brilliant to have the final defeat of Aku in the future, and just as Jack jumps into the portal, the Scotsman, the Triseraquin, the talking dogs and the innkeeper among others pull down an enormous statue of Aku in an echo of the statue of Saddam Hussein being toppled.

Also, the male bounty hunter's voice is done by John DiMaggio.  The same actor who did Bender on Futurama!And episode 30, in a graveyard, reminds me very much of the Evil Dead movies, right down to a spirit screaming - I will eat your soul!

972178,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B000EGDAFC,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","While not as good as the season before or after it, this is still a good buy.  Here's synopsizes of the episodes from the box, along with my review of each.27.  Chicken Jack:  Jack is turned into a chicken by a cranky wizard, then gets caught by a ""handler"" & becomes a prize-winning creature combat fighter.  The worst episode of the series.  I admit the beginning is good, but when Jack gets captured, it takes a turn for the worse.  The fights are good, but not what I wanted to see.  You know what I would have done?  After he gets turned into a chicken, he wonders the land searching for a cure & kicking butt along the way.  Just before he found the cure, he would have saved someone from Aku.  Aku getting beat by a chicken, now THAT would be hilarious!  D28.  Jack & the Rave:  When a man's daughter is kidnapped by Aku's children, Jack must infiltrate a rave to stop the musical brainwashing.  Great story, great action & great music.  Qhat more could you ask for?  A+29.  The Good, the Bad & the Beautiful:  Jack boards a train to his next destination only to be attacked by a couple of arguing bounty hunters.  One of the best, with a special guest appearance by Quickdraw McGraw, my favorite of the ""old"" Hanna-Barbera characters.  A+30.  Jack & the Zombies:  Aku leads Jack to a graveyard where the dead begin to rise.  An evil spirit takes over Jack's sword, & Jack fears he's met his end.  An excellent, atmospheric episode.  The silence in this show has never been more deafening.  A+31.  Jack in Egypt:  Jack must assemble a sacred scarab to call upon Ra for help in fighting evil ancient Egyptian shadow warriors.  A great episode.  A32.  Jack & the Traveling Creatures:  Jack & his traveling companions - creatures of the air, land & sea - attempt to find a portal for Jack to get home, but discover an undefeatable warrior instead.  One of the best episodes, simply for the ending.  A+33.  Jack & the Annoying Creature:  An overly-friendly creature begins following Jack, messing up Jack's every move along his quest.  Not the best of the comedic episodes, but it was still pretty funny.  B+34.  Jack & the Swamp Wizard:  Jack & a swamp wizard travel to the four corners of the earth, collecting pieces that are meant to get Jack back home.  While it had a twist you could see coming, it turned out to be a pretty good episode.  B+35.  Jack & the Haunted House:  Locked in a spooky, old mansion, Jack discovers he's not alone, and that his new roommates are plotting evil against him.  One of the scariest episodes.  A+36.  Jack, the Monks and the Ancient Master's Son:  Jack falls into a hidden temple sanctuary to find monks trained like him in the style of the Ancient Master.  Not the best episode, but not the worst either.  B37-38.  Birth of Evil:  The origin story of Aku, & how Jack's father got the sword that can destroy him.  My family & I are probably the only ones who think so, but I have to say that this is overrated.  We heard about the hype; it won an Emmy, Genndy said he thought it was absolutely perfect but we found it lacking.  I mean, there was never any question as to how it would end, so what was the point?  The beginning was interesting, & the end fight was good, but in between there were too many questions.  How does an attempt to cleanse this evil give it shape & form?  How come the beings who were hunting Aku in the first place don't come down to Earth to finish him off?  And if Jack's father saw all this, then how come he didn't keep the sword on him at all times in case Aku comes back?!  This really should have been just 1 part.  C39.  Jack & the Labyrinth:  Jack is carefully making his way through a labyrinth to reach a mysterious box.  The problem is, so is another thief.  This is an excellent episode to end the season on.  A+Like I said, it's still worth getting for the great episodes.  And if you're one of the people who love Birth of Evil, good for you.  I'm just not one of them.",5,Jack's quest continues.,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,3953,"['not', 'as', 'good', 'season', 'still', 'good', 'buy', 'Here', 'synopsizes', 'episodes', 'box', 'review', 'each.27', 'Chicken', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'turned', 'chicken', 'cranky', 'wizard', 'then', 'caught', 'handler', 'prize-winning', 'creature', 'combat', 'fighter', 'worst', 'episode', 'series', 'admit', 'beginning', 'good', 'when', 'Jack', 'captured', 'turn', 'worse', 'fights', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'turned', 'chicken', 'land', 'searching', 'cure', 'kicking', 'butt', 'way', 'Just', 'found', 'cure', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'someone', 'Aku', 'Aku', 'getting', 'beat', 'chicken', 'now', 'THAT', 'would', 'be', 'hilarious', 'D28', 'Jack', 'Rave', 'When', 'man', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'Aku', 'children', 'Jack', 'must', 'infiltrate', 'rave', 'stop', 'musical', 'brainwashing', 'Great', 'story', 'great', 'action', 'great', 'music', 'Qhat', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'A+29', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Beautiful', 'Jack', 'train', 'next', 'destination', 'only', 'be', 'attacked', 'couple', 'arguing', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'One', 'best', 'special', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Quickdraw', 'McGraw', 'favorite', 'old', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'characters', 'A+30', 'Jack', 'Zombies', 'Aku', 'Jack', 'graveyard', 'where', 'dead', 'begin', 'rise', 'evil', 'spirit', 'over', 'Jack', 'sword', 'Jack', 'met', 'end', 'excellent', 'atmospheric', 'episode', 'silence', 'show', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'deafening', 'A+31', 'Jack', 'Egypt', 'Jack', 'must', 'assemble', 'sacred', 'scarab', 'call', 'Ra', 'help', 'fighting', 'evil', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'shadow', 'warriors', 'great', 'episode', 'A32', 'Jack', 'Traveling', 'Creatures', 'Jack', 'traveling', 'companions', 'creatures', 'air', 'land', 'sea', 'attempt', 'find', 'portal', 'Jack', 'get', 'home', 'discover', 'undefeatable', 'warrior', 'instead', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'simply', 'ending', 'A+33', 'Jack', 'Annoying', 'Creature', 'overly-friendly', 'creature', 'following', 'Jack', 'messing', 'up', 'Jack', 'move', 'quest', 'Not', 'best', 'comedic', 'episodes', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'funny', 'B+34', 'Jack', 'Swamp', 'Wizard', 'Jack', 'swamp', 'wizard', 'travel', 'four', 'corners', 'earth', 'collecting', 'pieces', 'are', 'meant', 'get', 'Jack', 'back', 'home', 'had', 'twist', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'episode', 'B+35', 'Jack', 'Haunted', 'House', 'Locked', 'spooky', 'old', 'mansion', 'Jack', 'not', 'alone', 'new', 'roommates', 'are', 'plotting', 'evil', 'One', 'scariest', 'episodes', 'A+36', 'Jack', 'Monks', 'Ancient', 'Master', 'Son', 'Jack', 'hidden', 'temple', 'sanctuary', 'find', 'monks', 'trained', 'style', 'Ancient', 'Master', 'Not', 'best', 'episode', 'not', 'worst', 'B37-38', 'Birth', 'Evil', 'origin', 'story', 'Aku', 'how', 'Jack', 'father', 'got', 'sword', 'can', 'destroy', 'My', 'family', 'are', 'probably', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'think', 'so', 'have', 'say', 'overrated', 'heard', 'hype', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Genndy', 'said', 'thought', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'found', 'lacking', 'mean', 'was', 'never', 'question', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'beginning', 'was', 'interesting', 'end', 'fight', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'How', 'attempt', 'cleanse', 'evil', 'give', 'shape', 'form', 'How', 'come', 'beings', 'who', 'were', 'hunting', 'Aku', 'first', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'down', 'Earth', 'finish', 'off', 'Jack', 'father', 'saw', 'then', 'how', 'come', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'sword', 'times', 'case', 'Aku', 'back', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'just', '1', 'part', 'C39', 'Jack', 'Labyrinth', 'Jack', 'carefully', 'making', 'way', 'labyrinth', 'reach', 'mysterious', 'box', 'problem', 'so', 'thief', 'excellent', 'episode', 'end', 'season', 'A+Like', 'said', 'still', 'worth', 'getting', 'great', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'Birth', 'Evil', 'good', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'one']",Samurai Jack Season 3

For those who are unfamiliar, Samurai Jack is an ancient warrior flung into the future where his arch nemesis, Aku, has achieved dominion on Earth.  Jack must find a way to return to the past and defeat Aku- all this you'll quickly learn in the opening scenes of each episode.The cartoon typical deals in some type of new adventure in a new and artfully created environment.  The best episodes always involve a great deal of sword fighting where Jack dispatches the robotic minions of Aku.  There are also more than a few episodes that illustrate a moral value, and some that are made to be funny.  So you won't get bored watching more than one in a row.  The animation style has a retro look to it, and it is probably the best cartoon artwork I can think of.Season Three contains some of the best episodes in the series- my favorites are: when Jack must fight his way out of a haunted graveyard; and when Jack meets warrior monks.  Also noteworthy in this collection is the two part episode that details Aku's creation, and the story of Jack's father.  This one was awarded an Emmy that is well deserved.Now, I purchase a good deal of TV series DVDs because I am stationed overseas right now- and if I was in the States I'd just watch TV and not get the DVDs.

Nothing is going to win me over simply because it is animation. Samurai Jack does not win me over because it is animation - because it is so much more than that.You cannot really go wrong with any season of Samurai Jack. You can easily get away with jumping into the series at any point. So don't feel like you have to start with season 1 and work your way up from there.I grew up with the old Warner Brothers cartoons that could entertain kids and adults alike. There were jokes that could appeal to various ages with the kids not quite getting the jokes aimed at the adults.I now have three sons of my own all under the age of 8 and I enjoy watching Samurai Jack with them. It amazes me what they absorb from the series. Of course, there is the high testosterone appeal of the sword fighting. But would you be surprised to hear that Samurai Jack has helped my boys understand the concepts of determination, oppression, empathy,working hard to achieve goals and honor? Just to name a few.My boys get that good old Jack is good at what he does because he works hard at it. They see Jack try to talk his way out of problems when he can. They see him being sympathetic to others who are hurt or in trouble. They see him standing up against things that are unfair, cruel or just plain nasty.The conversations I have with my boys during and after an episode of Samurai Jack are amazing.

Like the first two seasons, there's two discs with 13 episodes of the really great show and a few DVD extras to boot !  One of those features happen to be ""The Martial Arts of Samurai Jack,"" featuring behind-the-scenes footage uncovering the martial arts moves used in the show; reminicent to moves used in the series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender.""  Another feature is ""The Lost Art Work Gallery"", self-explanatory.Finally, the moment you've been waiting for, here's the Season Three top five episodes !  Which are:5. ""The Birth of Evil"" (parts 1 & 2) - This two-part special tells the origin of AKU and how he was first defeated way before the birth of Jack.  To see and hear more, select the optional audio commentary on the two-parter by Genndy Tartakofsky himself in the special features section.4. ""Chicken Jack"" - A wizard grouchily turns the samurai into a chicken !  But even as a chicken, Jack is still quite the fighter !3. ""Jack and the Clenches"" (a.k.a. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful"") - Jack is in for a wild, wild-western train ride when he's up against a bounty hunter couple also aboard the train.  (Look for Quick-Draw McGraw in this episode !)2. ""Jack and the Temple"" - Jack comes across a mysterious hidden temple of monks in training with moves just like Jack.  The Ancient Master of the temple even informs Jack of a time portal to send him home.1. ""Jack and the Rave Slaves"" - This happens to be my most favorite episode in the whole series !  In this episode, Jack finds a huge group of teenagers pillaging the town he's staying at, and one of them was the innkeeper's daughter.  He goes undercover to find out what's going on.  It turns out the kids were being brainwashed by killer techno-dance music and Jack defeats AKU's dastardly deejay.  (P.S.  I sometimes even supply my OWN dance music for this episode !  I love that kind of music, you know.)Honorable Mention: ""Jack and the Labyrinth"" - Jack goes through a winding labyrinth in order to find a treasure.  Little did he know, a theif is after this treasure, too.Well, that about covers it.  I sure hope season four is just as good when that comes out.",4,"Look Out, Mack !
