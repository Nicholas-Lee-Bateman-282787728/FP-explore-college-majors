262065,A3BFJFJRXMWXAX,6301691687,Andy Williamson,"[12, 18]","First off, I consider myself to be right-of-center when it comes to social and political issues. I'm conservative in most respects and I often don't agree with Moore's viewpoints. Knowing his left-leaning slant on everything helps one to decipher this film. But that doesn't mean he doesn't make good points. This film is a bit heavy-handed and at times borders on propaganda. Nevertheless, I think it's HILARIOUS. I grant the points stated by some others that:a) GM did not butcher rabbits (did that lady look to be a person who would hold down a steady job!?)b) GM did not evict persons from their homes (though we see people being evicted. What does this have to do with GM?)c) What is the point of trying to manufacture cars in an outdated plant? Whether GM could have/should have built a new plant on that site is another matter entirelyLife is tough all over and you can go to any city ANYTIME (heck, even in the 'sticks') and there is bound to be someone being kicked out of a home for some reason (it's happening here in Chicago to lots of people in public housing projects-where will they go?). I'm sure Moore was trying to forge a link between people getting laid off at GM and kicked out of their homes. I don't remember him specifically showing GM workers getting kicked out of their homes so I don't believe he was sucessful in that regard...he was more sucessful in convincing me that Flint, Michigan is one of the [worst] dumps in all of America.The question is, is that GM's fault? Not solely. Flint, like many cities in the industrial north has seen its day come and go. Any student of urban studies-such as myself-would probably agree that the decline of Flint has as much to do with its SIZE as anything else. The smaller the town, the less 'draw' it has for industry, sales, and tertiary trades and commerce. The close proximity of Chicago and Detroit don't help either. In that respect Moore fails to convince me that GM is solely responsible for Flint's ills. You have to watch the film with a sense of humor and take Moore's arguments with a grain of salt. After all, MONEY magazine named Flint the worst town in America-I'm sure it had to do with MANY issues, not just the economic sphere, of which (admittedly) GM was a big part. Yet Moore makes some important (though obvious) points and raises some thorny questions:a) What is corporate responsibility? To workers and cities or to shareholders? Often they are one in the same.b) How do we deal with crumbling industrial-age cities?c) What other circumstances lead to the decay of older urban areas?d) Moore implies that it is immoral to treat workers in the manner in which they are treated in the film. But perhaps the 'worker vs. corporation' view of the issue is too myopic?Moore is famous for his outspoken agenda(s). He's [mad] (rightly so) and you can tell that in the film. But just because we don't like something, does that make it wrong? Conversely, just because we like something, does that make it right? I do think that GM has an obligation to retain American jobs, but whether or not that is in Flint is their (and ultimately the shareholders) decision.The reason the film is so funny is that many of the big-wigs do look like morons parroting the same old stories, and the attempts by the city to foster growth and rejuvenation are laughable. Pat Boone, Anita whats-her-name, and Eubanks from the game show...hilarious. (And what's the deal with the human statues at that party? What a creepy place.) This is civic government in all its inept glory! The bits about the news van being stolen and the guy in the middle of the street with the Superman outfit and rifle always cause me to laugh uncontrollably. Perhaps Flint is merely that unlikely black hole to which all the worst elements of our society and human nature are drawn? Or is that Gary, Indiana? Actually, I think Florida is absorbing all the stupid people right now...All I know is that when I want to visit Flint, I'll do it via videotape!Bottom line: if you can't watch this film and laugh because deep down you know some of Moore's points are correct, you are probably too conservative. If you can't look outside of Moore's cloistered politics/economics and bring a little critique to the message of the film, you are probably too liberal.",5,Some of you are WAY too serious!,1032220800,"09 17, 2002",2002,4296,"['First', 'consider', 'be', 'right-of-center', 'when', 'social', 'political', 'issues', ""'m"", 'conservative', 'most', 'respects', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Moore', 'viewpoints', 'Knowing', 'left-leaning', 'slant', 'everything', 'one', 'decipher', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'borders', 'propaganda', 'Nevertheless', 'think', 'HILARIOUS', 'grant', 'points', 'stated', 'others', 'GM', 'did', 'not', 'butcher', 'rabbits', 'did', 'lady', 'look', 'be', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'hold', 'down', 'steady', 'job', 'b', 'GM', 'did', 'not', 'evict', 'persons', 'homes', 'see', 'people', 'being', 'evicted', 'What', 'have', 'do', 'GM', 'c', 'What', 'point', 'trying', 'manufacture', 'cars', 'outdated', 'plant', 'Whether', 'GM', 'could', 'have/should', 'have', 'built', 'new', 'plant', 'site', 'matter', 'entirelyLife', 'tough', 'can', 'go', 'city', 'ANYTIME', 'heck', 'even', ""'sticks"", 'bound', 'be', 'someone', 'being', 'kicked', 'home', 'reason', 'happening', 'here', 'Chicago', 'lots', 'people', 'public', 'housing', 'projects-where', 'will', 'go', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Moore', 'was', 'trying', 'forge', 'link', 'people', 'getting', 'laid', 'off', 'GM', 'kicked', 'homes', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'specifically', 'showing', 'GM', 'workers', 'getting', 'kicked', 'homes', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'sucessful', 'regard', 'was', 'more', 'sucessful', 'convincing', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'one', '[', 'worst', ']', 'dumps', 'America.The', 'question', 'GM', 'fault', 'Not', 'solely', 'Flint', 'many', 'cities', 'industrial', 'north', 'seen', 'day', 'come', 'go', 'student', 'urban', 'studies-such', 'myself-would', 'probably', 'agree', 'decline', 'Flint', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'SIZE', 'anything', 'else', 'smaller', 'town', 'less', ""'draw"", 'industry', 'sales', 'tertiary', 'trades', 'commerce', 'close', 'proximity', 'Chicago', 'Detroit', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'respect', 'Moore', 'convince', 'GM', 'solely', 'responsible', 'Flint', 'ills', 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'sense', 'humor', 'take', 'Moore', 'arguments', 'grain', 'salt', 'MONEY', 'magazine', 'named', 'Flint', 'worst', 'town', 'America-I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'do', 'MANY', 'issues', 'not', 'just', 'economic', 'sphere', 'admittedly', 'GM', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'Moore', 'important', 'obvious', 'points', 'thorny', 'questions', 'What', 'corporate', 'responsibility', 'workers', 'cities', 'shareholders', 'are', 'one', 'same.b', 'How', 'do', 'deal', 'crumbling', 'industrial-age', 'cities', 'c', 'What', 'other', 'circumstances', 'lead', 'decay', 'older', 'urban', 'areas', 'd', 'Moore', 'immoral', 'treat', 'workers', 'manner', 'are', 'treated', 'film', 'perhaps', ""'worker"", 'vs.', 'corporation', 'view', 'issue', 'too', 'myopic', 'Moore', 'famous', 'outspoken', 'agenda', 's', '[', 'mad', ']', 'rightly', 'so', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'something', 'make', 'wrong', 'Conversely', 'just', 'like', 'something', 'make', 'right', 'do', 'think', 'GM', 'obligation', 'retain', 'American', 'jobs', 'not', 'Flint', 'ultimately', 'shareholders', 'decision.The', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'funny', 'many', 'big-wigs', 'do', 'look', 'morons', 'parroting', 'same', 'old', 'stories', 'attempts', 'city', 'foster', 'growth', 'rejuvenation', 'are', 'laughable', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'Anita', 'whats-her-name', 'Eubanks', 'game', 'show', 'hilarious', 'what', 'deal', 'human', 'statues', 'party', 'What', 'creepy', 'place', 'civic', 'government', 'inept', 'glory', 'bits', 'news', 'van', 'being', 'stolen', 'guy', 'middle', 'street', 'Superman', 'outfit', 'rifle', 'always', 'cause', 'laugh', 'uncontrollably', 'Perhaps', 'Flint', 'merely', 'unlikely', 'black', 'hole', 'worst', 'elements', 'society', 'human', 'nature', 'are', 'drawn', 'Gary', 'Indiana', 'Actually', 'think', 'Florida', 'absorbing', 'stupid', 'people', 'right', 'now', 'know', 'when', 'want', 'visit', 'Flint', ""'ll"", 'do', 'videotape', 'Bottom', 'line', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'laugh', 'deep', 'know', 'Moore', 'points', 'are', 'correct', 'are', 'probably', 'too', 'conservative', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'Moore', 'cloistered', 'politics/economics', 'bring', 'little', 'critique', 'message', 'film', 'are', 'probably', 'too', 'liberal']",Roger & Me VHS

262068,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6301691687,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 1]","I went to college at the University of Michigan's main Ann Arbor campus. We used to make jokes about the Flint campus as being just about automotive engineering. I knew General Motors was big there, but I didn't realize until I saw this movie today that they essentially owned the whole city.The Roger in the title is Roger Smith, at that time Chairman of GM. Michael Moore grew up in Flint. So when GM started closing plants and laying off thousands of auto workers, Michael decides he's going to interview Roger and ask him what he has to say to the laid-off workers of Flint. Amazingly, after three years of determined effort, he finally got to ask a few questions of Smith. Not that it did any good, of course.Moore makes it clear that the only solution offered to the laid off workers was to move out of town, and probably out of state. Some got jobs at Taco Bell, but couldn't keep them in light of the demands for hurry, hurry, hurry. Michael interviews the manager of one of the Taco Bell restaurants.He also talks to the sheriff's deputy in charge of housing evictions (just doing my job; somebody's got to do it), the laid off auto workers who were persuaded to take training to be a prison guard, as the crime rate in Flint skyrocketed. Talks to the country club set who insist that Flint is a lovely town, and generally documents the death of a city.Now, I've never had much reason to like Flint, but it does seem rather horrible that the decision of GM to move a good bit of their manufacturing to Mexico was rather callous. He asks Miss Michigan what she would like to say to the laid-off workers, and she asks them to cross their fingers for HER, so she can be Miss America. They must have, because she won. To me, she also won the prize for unashamed selfishness.This one is both important and entertaining--although I had to cover my eyes when the woman who sold rabbits killed and skinned one on screen.

Michael Moore is the filmmaker and Roger is Roger Smith, the head of GM at the time, whom he tries, without success, to interview on the tragedy at Flint. Irony is the best device to use in a documentary like this, and Moore loads the film with it: people being evicted while the rich are saying life is wonderful there, and the city investing millions of dollars in tourism but the tourists never come. The ultimate irony is found in the running interview Moore has with a GM p.r. man who argues for the good of the company - but at the end he's laid off, too.

""Roger and Me"", started it all, with a look at Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan and the ongoing economic problems faced by its citizens.The reason the city of Flint was chosen isn't just because of its economic woes. It was also chosen because it is Moore's hometown. He grew up in Flint and his dad was an employee at one of the local General Motors plants. This background provides a good basis for making a documentary about GM and its influence on the local people of Flint. Moore has experienced the drama first hand, so he knows what it is like to witness people as they go from the assembly line to the unemployment line.Roger Smith, the former chairman of GM, is the centerpiece of this documentary and Moore spends much of his time in the film trying to find Smith and conduct an interview with him. Smith eludes Moore throughout the documentary. Only on one occasion does Moore get a chance to talk directly with Smith- at a GM shareholder's meeting. And even then, the results are less than satisfactory because there is too little time to talk and Smith seems unprepared and defensive.Humor, frustration, and devastation are all important ingredients of this documentary. I particularly enjoyed the scene with a woman who skins rabbits and uses their fur for her business. She just stands there, with the cameras rolling, butchering bunnies like its nothing. It' funny and weird at the same time to watch this woman willing to do whatever necessary to make a living. There are also plenty of scenes of the city of Flint, showing abandoned businesses, empty homes, and other sobering signs of a city in depression.For a first- time documentary, I think this one is very good.

262071,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6301691687,calvinnme,"[6, 8]","Michael Moore's first major film was one of his best in my opinion for two reasons. First off, since he did not yet have a trademark style, he did not try to go over the top in this film as much as he does in his subsequent efforts. He does his normal routine of tracking people down in an effort to embarrass them by asking them pointed questions, but for most of the film he lets the story and the citizens of Flint do the talking. As you probably already know, this is the story of Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan, and the utter despair that fell upon it after GM began shuttering auto plants under the supervision of then CEO Roger Smith. The film really highlights how clueless Flint's elite are as to the suffering that all of this ""consolidation"" is causing. At one point in the film Moore is talking to some wealthy people at a party who seem to think they are doing the unemployed some kind of favor by hiring them to act as living statues at one of their fetes. When he asks the partygoers about what is going on in Flint they seem somewhat offended that there is such ""negative publicity"" circulating and say there should be more emphasis on the positive things going on in Flint - they name the symphony and the opera. Ah yes, let them eat opera glasses! The second reason I consider this film to be one of Moore's best is that even though this film was made in 1989, it is still interesting and relevant today. This is because the contrast between what average working people have to endure - the struggle to find secure jobs with decent benefits and their increasing vulnerability - and the desire of the captains of industry to improve the bottom line at any cost ... as long as it doesn't cost them ... has only worsened and deepened over the last 17 years since this film was first made.",5,Story of Flint presaged what has happened since,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,1806,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'opinion', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'did', 'not', 'yet', 'have', 'trademark', 'style', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'go', 'top', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'subsequent', 'efforts', 'normal', 'routine', 'tracking', 'people', 'down', 'effort', 'embarrass', 'asking', 'pointed', 'questions', 'most', 'film', 'story', 'citizens', 'Flint', 'do', 'talking', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'Moore', 'hometown', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'utter', 'despair', 'fell', 'GM', 'began', 'shuttering', 'auto', 'plants', 'supervision', 'then', 'CEO', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'film', 'really', 'highlights', 'how', 'clueless', 'Flint', 'elite', 'are', 'suffering', 'consolidation', 'causing', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Moore', 'talking', 'wealthy', 'people', 'party', 'who', 'seem', 'think', 'are', 'doing', 'unemployed', 'kind', 'favor', 'hiring', 'act', 'living', 'statues', 'one', 'fetes', 'When', 'partygoers', 'what', 'going', 'Flint', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'offended', 'such', 'negative', 'publicity', 'circulating', 'say', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'emphasis', 'positive', 'things', 'going', 'Flint', 'name', 'symphony', 'opera', 'Ah', 'yes', 'let', 'eat', 'opera', 'glasses', 'second', 'reason', 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'Moore', 'best', 'even', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1989', 'still', 'interesting', 'relevant', 'today', 'contrast', 'what', 'average', 'working', 'people', 'have', 'endure', 'struggle', 'find', 'secure', 'jobs', 'decent', 'benefits', 'increasing', 'vulnerability', 'desire', 'captains', 'industry', 'improve', 'bottom', 'line', 'cost', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'cost', 'only', 'worsened', 'deepened', 'last', '17', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'made']",Roger & Me VHS

All I know is this movie was pretty funny and kinda sad.  This movie was released in the late 80's, and basically tries to show the what the director believes are inequities between the working class schlubs and rich, management types.  The thing that seemed to come through for me was the issue of greed.  I don't think greed in and of itself is all that bad, but when you make decisions that adversely effect thousands of peoples ability to economically support themselves soley on the basis to fatten your bottom line, or increase your annual bonus, or buy that third or fourth house, then maybe something is wrong.  I don't have a problem with some people having a lot of money, but when said fortunes are gotten through deceiving and cheating those doing the work that produces said fortunes, that doesn't seem right.  It's interesting that this was made almost 15 years ago and just recently we've witnessed the excessiveness of a number of CEOs within the last year or two, and how their actions have affected those that worked for the companies, Enron, Tyco, Worldcom, etc.  Is Michael Moore some kind of prophet?  I don't think so...but he could remake this movie today with any number of individuals involved in the current scandals.  I have heard many critics say he takes things out of context, misrepresents the truth, and edits scenes or even removes them to make his point.

As a huge fan of American hero Michael Moore who brought us the controversial ""Bowling For Columbine"" and the politically powerful ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", I was more than compelled to check out his first documentary of his career, 1989's heartbreaking ""Roger and Me"" which is an important documentary that everyone from all over the political spectrum should at least take some time to watch.Set in his home town of Flint, Michigan, ""Roger & Me"" focuses on then General Motors Corporate CEO Roger Smith who became CEO in January of 1981. This man was a catastrophic disaster in the makings. During the 1900s and all the way into the 1960s, Flint, Michigan was a thriving community and often had numerous celebrations as one of the economic powerhouses of the Midwest. However, when Smith closed down the General Motors plants to open new ones in Mexico, the results were utterly devastation to the extent that Flint, Michigan has never really recovered from.This documentary, Moore's first of his career, sets it's sight into the plight of the working citizens and residents of the city of Flint, and what they went through when enduring the massive hardships that enshrouded them. One of the scenes I couldn't digest was where a sheriff would evict impoverished residents who could no longer afford to pay their rent and one of these was really angering to watch which I'm not going to give out out of fear of spoiling it.The city of Flint especially with what it once was is now one of the saddest stories of American history. As Michael Moore says dueing a commentary on the DVD, it has only gotten worse in the years since this came out in 1989 and that it has been virtually left to fade away into the background.Wherever you lie on the political spectrum, this is a worthwhile watch and really peers into the effects of such a heinous, callous, and horrific act of corporate greed and what the effects of Smith's actions have had on Flint Michigan.Although I've never been to Flint but I would say that even if it is a really downtrodden place, it still has some good qualities, like all other American cities.

Moore's valiant and persistent efforts to reach out to Roger Smith, Chairman of GM, are admirable.  It was rather intriguing to see how so difficult it was to get through to Mr. Smith.  My interpretation of such a struggle to get to one important individual is a reflection of the American people's frustration with the system and the politicians.The &quot;two Americas&quot; that John Kerry and John Edwards speak of, are clearly exemplified throughout this movie ranging from the elites within GM and those being evicted from their homes at Christmas time.

It was the documentary that made him somewhat famous you can say.  Anyway, this film details the closing of a General Motors factory and 30,000 people being laid off.  With this many people being out of a job, Flint becomes a city with a high crime rate, high numbers of eviction notices, people moving out of Flint, and a lot of people getting on welfare.  Moore has many interviews with people who discuss the positive side of outsourcing such as Bob Eubanks, some other famous Flint personalities, Miss Michigan, a GM lobbyist and many other people.Whether you agree that a corporation should or should not outsource, both sides are shown.  In news media though, the devastating eviction notices and other things are never shown with such clarity and emotion.  When a chairman of a huge company such as GM does donate money or do anything philanthropic, they make sure there are plenty of press and PR people around.Moore tries throughout this whole movie - over a course of three years to speak with Roger Smith, the chairman of GM.  One time he comes close during a shareholder's meeting but I don't want to ruin that part for you.There is so much that happens in this documentary.  Flint tries to survive by becoming a tourist place, a new prison is open where rich people have a sleep over?!?

262085,AIOXMENE1HBR7,6301691687,GreatMovieCriticRobertfromUS,"[8, 17]","This is quite possibly one of the most important movies in the last 20 yrs. Michael Moore by putting his own passion and blood into the making of this movie, showing corporate greed at all levels from political to civil , got an Oscar for this film and he pretty much cemented himself as one of the bravest and strongest directors ever.Shot on location in Flint Michigan, with real people including former corrupt President Ronald Reagan, this movie it as real as it gets. It pretty much started the whole documentaries on exposing corporate greed and well the downhill and moral decline of America (also shown in ""The Big One"" and ""Bowling for Columbine"" (which won the Oscar for Michael Moore).Before I get more into depth of the movie, I asked you to remember these image in your heads to show you how sad the situation in Flint Michigan both in 1989 and 2003 are:In the movie while General Motors is showing profits of over a billion dollars,they disgusting laid off over 25,000 factory workers. I repeat General Motors was showing a profit, not a loss, yet they decided to lay of thousands of people basically giving them a death sentence.Most factory workers didn't have the money to pay for their mortgage and were evicted,during one scene in the movie as many as 25 people in one day were evicted even on Christmas Eve.To show the real disgusting situation. A poor and mentally disturbed woman by the name of Rhonda Britton is so desperate to get money for her kids that she tries to sell Rabbits as pets. When that doesn't work she ends literally killing these poor animals and selling them as meat!!!! Which includes skinning them alive!!! The real sad part is that there a million dollar GM hotel only a few yars from where this women is doing this acts to get any form of help for herself.Basically Flint , Michigan as shown in the movie, from once a booming celestial center of action, is now a corrupt, poor , and crime infested city with no hope even amidst the lies of former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Reagan's promise that they ""would change the situation"".In fact Reagan as shown in the movie uses Flint basically as a campaign ploy to elect himself during the 1980's. It's disgusting.Now the plot deals with General Motors and their disgusting actions of laying of well basically everyone who works for them in the factory. Even amidst Union groups like UAW , and booming profits, GM pulls the most disgusting acts reported in corporate history.So Michael Moore seeing the situation that is happening, makes this movie as he puts it during the trailer ""I did this movie to raise the spirits of the workers"". Indeed he did, but more importantly he showed America and the world corporate greed up close and personal and the many people covering up the lie that all is well on GM.For instance Anita Bryant, Bob Eubanks and Pat Boone are 3 disgusting American celebrities who basically are hired by GM to fool the town into thinking everythings nice at Flint Michigan. They hire them for Carnivals, parades, tourism, nything. In Eubanks case as shown in the film, this self indulgent pig is promoting his newlywed game. Eubank is one of the first celebrities that Moore exposes. Eubanks at first seeing Moore doesn't think that Moore wont do much damage.And thats the big mistake that everyone at Flint Michigan does as quoted in the commentary by Moore ""getting an interview with these people was easy...because they just took look one look at me and figured oh this isn't going anywhere"".My God how wrong those people are. As stated in the first sentence where Eubanks shows his antisemetic joke, he obviously didn't think Moore's movie would have any impact. but furthermore, Eubanks is the typical example of every greedy American pig in the movie. He thinks because he has power he can treat and offend those who don't have power and those who aren't around to listen to his offensive remarks.Again backed up by Moore's commentary ""This people thought they could be offensive ecause the groups that they were being offensive too weren't there."" True cowardism and Moore's shows that too.The movie moves on to show the Union groups attempt to gain their jobs back and get GM to turn the situation around but they fail. One of the reasons they failed is because the Union Managers themselves kept giving concessions to GM, meaningly they gave into GM demands without getting anything in return.... True stupidity.The movie then shows us Moore's attempts to talk to and question the main man behind the GM scandal Roger Smith, the chairman and Ceo of Gm (this old greedy (...) is no longer the head of Gm).Moore's attempts go awry at first, apparently Smith has goons stopping him and people like Ralph Nader from exposing the greedy Smith. Eventually though using the fact that people underestimate him Moore does meet Smith (for 2 minutes basically) before Smith hightails it ouf there and Moore is removed from security from the Gm building at Chrismas no less!!! Where Smith aware of the unemployment, and crime wave hitting the city as a result of the layoffs still seeks to spew his lies and image of Gm into the media.Special Features of the DVD include the original trailerfor the film and an Audio Commentary from Moore himselfin 2003 nearly fifteen years after the release of the movie.",5,Roger on Me on Special Edition DVD:,1088035200,"06 24,

Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker.  This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today.  You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors.  I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest.  It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World.  It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time.  Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year).  Moore in recent years has become a ""political celebrity"", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America.  It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too.  They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows.  A lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods.  I don't know if Moore is like that or not.

Michael sets out to tell his father's story to the head of GM, Roger. The film is partly a bout Flint. All the failed attempts to bring new business to the town, and the various ways the inhabitants try to cope. The stupidity of the Town Council is amazing. Moore does not give them their jobs back, but he rescues them from anonymity; he gives them a voice, and a face. He tells that behind the profit margins, behind the business strategies, we have human beings. Humans with dreams and emotions, just like Roger. They do not have a Board, or millions of dollars backing them though. We also follow Michael Moore's hilarious attempts at meeting with Roger, just to ask him to go to Flint.This is Moore's first film. In many ways it is is best, because it is so close to his heart.

As if the town that was part and parcel in creating one of the world's wealthiest companies was something they could just dispose of like a worn out part of one of their cars.Any and all investments GM made in Flint were shallow and solely for the purpose of PR.

Flint has never recovered to this day. It's a has-been, just like Detroit is a has-been that will never recover. Ever.

262100,A1RFWRJCAIF0DR,6301691687,Kenji Miwa,"[2, 3]","Although humorous and entertaining, one can understand why critics such as Pauline Kael and Harlan Jacobson have a problem with Michael Moore's approach to documentary filmmaking.  Indeed, from the audience's perspective, almost everyone Moore interacts with in Roger & Me looks callous, short-sighted, or inane through his lens; albeit for good reason.  In addition, once viewers become conscious of Moore's domineering edit techniques and chronological laxity, they may write off the valid arguments he does make.  But if Moore strictly adhered to documentary ethics, would Roger & Me still have been the most successful documentary of its time?  While there is no clean cut rebuttal to Moore's critics, each argument must be examined case by case, gauging their contextual validity.Perhaps the most piercing evidence of Moore's manipulation is his decision to omit the dialogue between him and Roger Smith during the 1987 GM shareholders meeting.  This point, in particular, is so pivotal because the film is driven by Moore's quest to speak with Roger Smith.  Moore could have easily not attended the meeting and therefore not even mention it.  This quandary alone realizes Moore's ability to direct the story as he pleases.  As the scene unfolds in the film, Roger Smith appears to be ignoring Moore's presence despite Moore's plea for questions.  Here, Moore shows conscious manipulation of an event; an indisputable example that he crossed the line.  Problematic scenes on this order of magnitude can completely shatter the viewer's trust in Moore as a documentary filmmaker and what we see on screen.  Jacobsen explains, ""[Roger & Me] has the form of documentary...we expect that what we are seeing there happened, in the way in which it happened, in the way in which we are told it happened.""On the other hand, one problem Moore's critics are overlooking is that they are lumping Roger & Me into the largely diverse and loosely defined genre known as ""the documentary,"" as if all films showing real footage of real people and events should be held to the same standards.  Roger & Me is a hodgepodge of Bill Nichol's documentary modes beginning with the participatory where Moore comments on his personal upbringing and explains how he became involved in filmmaking.  Most of Roger & Me progresses in participatory mode, however there are brief jaunts of expository mode where Moore recaps a series of events in ""voice of God"" narrative.  The film climaxes in poetic mode with a carefully choreographed juxtaposition of Smith's warm Christmas message of giving against the harsh images and sounds of a family being evicted; eliciting a contradictory response to Smith's speech.  If we also include Moore's style of slight manipulation, what typology of documentary is this?Like fiction films, the documentary genre has become increasingly more complex and experimental; blurring the boundaries of its classification.  Moore may have created a new sub-genre of documentary: one that combines Nichol's documentary modes in a heuristic visual essay where accurate historical representation is eclipsed by unbridled personal emotion.  Interestingly, Moore calls Roger & Me ""an entertaining movie that hopefully will get people to think a little bit about what is going on"".  If his intention is to galvanize the public, then does the end justify the means?  Does the fact that Roger & Me became the all time best selling documentary upon its release, exposing millions of people to important social issues through the powerful medium of film, justify the bending of truth in his films?  In retrospect, I agree with minor stipulation.  Is it ok that Moore ambushes people who have no idea of his agenda?  In response to Pauline Kael's article, I have no grievance with Moore's ambush interview technique towards people on the street or corporate PR representatives.  Kael questions ""what does Moore expect?""  I doubt Moore expects an insightful and well articulated response from everyone he speaks to.  However, Moore's strategy is effective at probing the collective consciousness of America for us to ponder.  All too often companies are given ample prep time to strategize a self-serving spin to public inquiry.  Moore's approach, in effect, catches them with their pants down.  In response to Moore's truth bending, although I disagree with Moore, perhaps he believed it was the only way to reach a broad audience when traditional documentary films and grassroots newpapers were dwarfed by Hollywood blockbusters and mainstream media.I am still somewhat at a loss in that I admire and respect Michael Moore for what he has achieved.  Moore provides a voice for those in the lower rungs of our hierarchal society--he is confrontational, he probes routine corporate operations, he reminds us not to become too complacent in our daily lives.  Still, some of his tactics are completely unethical and imposing.  I believe Moore has the ability to make entertaining and socially introspective films without the problems mentioned.  Whatever you call his films, one cannot deny that galvanizing public interest on social issues is a bad thing for America.",4,A Critique of Roger & Me and its Critics,1175644800,"04 4,

Through dark humor, shocking moments, and valid points, Moore examines poverty in America from all sides of the issue, getting interviews from all sides of the conflicts presented. It chronicles a few years in Flint and their attempts to become a prosperous town despite an incredible amount of poverty and bad press. Moore does what filmmakers are afraid to do: he tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but. Like it or not, what is on the screen is all true, and no one but him and those suffering seem to be doing anything about it. I cried at one point in the movie, when Moore is interviewing a man who went crazy while driving home from his terrible job one night. The Beach Boys came on the radio and the man lost it. I did too. Tears started coming down. I'm revered in a rich white community, so seeing such poverty a state away from me hits me hard. I'm so used to the good life that I never stop to look at the people who have it so crummy. I cried watching this movie. I was shocked that people in America were actually treated this way. In one scene, a man is shot right in front of the camera because he was trying to protect his family. In another, a woman kills a rabbit to sell to someone for food so she can make money.

262108,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6301691687,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Roger & Me is a somewhat humorous documentary by Michael Moore about the devastating economic effects of Flint, Michigan when General Motors chairman Roger B. Smith chooses to close eleven car manufacturing plants there. The town is financially reeling from the 30,000 lost jobs and Flint slumps into a semi-depression.Moore also attempts many, many times in this film to track Roger Smith (who is the Roger referred to in the title of the film) and interview him. Not surprisingly, Smith and his cronies have Moore all figured out and Moore is never able to catch Smith off-guard--except once, and I'll let that be a surprise to you because I don't want to give too many spoilers here!As the film progresses, we meet the desperately poor people of Flint who are being evicted from their homes practically every day--in one day the sheriff's deputy evicts people from 24 homes! We also see the very rich people playing golf and having theme parties (""The Great Gatsby"" theme party, for example) and these wealthy people do in fact appear to be ridiculously out of touch with the real, painful problems of the poor. Just as one woman playing golf is hitting her golf ball, she is caught on camera saying that the poor are taking ""the easy way out."" What on earth was SHE doing when she was playing golf instead of maybe doing some charity work with the less fortunate? I never had the feeling that the rich people in their highly insulated communities around Flint ever truly understood the plight of the poor people.Unfortunately, it is equally true that General Motors never signed a contract with the people of Flint to provide them with jobs and health insurance from cradle to grave. That's the way things go in our society--you or your employer can end the employment at any time, with or even without notice. I believe that's the case in most if not all fifty states. Naturally, this does not mean I don't feel great, great empathy and sympathy for those who were laid off; it's just that when GM closed those eleven plants we got an ugly reminder of just how rough this type of non-contracted employment can be.I suppose Moore could have made his film a bit more balanced; to produce a solid documentary you really need to show both sides of the story. Moore tries to accomplish this by interviewing a friend of Roger Smith; but the footage Moore chooses to give us is that of a man who couldn't possibly care less about the General Motors employees.The DVD is light on extras although we do get an optional commentary by Michael Moore.Overall, Roger & Me is at times sad and at other times entertaining; we see a portrait of just how harsh ""free enterprise"" can be to the common man who depends on their weekly paycheck for survival. The humor we do get is not bad but Moore could have been a bit more even handed in his presentation of the issue. I nevertheless recommend this film for Michael Moore fans and people who study politics, political science and work related issues. People who are truly concerned with the plight of everyday human beings and the working poor will also appreciate this movie.",4,very good despite a minor flaw here and there,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,3113,"['Roger', 'Me', 'somewhat', 'humorous', 'documentary', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'devastating', 'economic', 'effects', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'when', 'General', 'Motors', 'chairman', 'Roger', 'B.', 'Smith', 'close', 'eleven', 'car', 'manufacturing', 'plants', 'there', 'town', 'financially', 'reeling', '30,000', 'lost', 'jobs', 'Flint', 'slumps', 'semi-depression.Moore', 'also', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'track', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'who', 'Roger', 'referred', 'title', 'film', 'interview', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Smith', 'cronies', 'have', 'Moore', 'figured', 'out', 'Moore', 'never', 'able', 'catch', 'Smith', 'off-guard', 'once', ""'ll"", 'let', 'be', 'surprise', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'here', 'film', 'meet', 'desperately', 'poor', 'people', 'Flint', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'evicted', 'homes', 'practically', 'day', 'one', 'day', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'evicts', 'people', '24', 'homes', 'also', 'see', 'very', 'rich', 'people', 'playing', 'golf', 'having', 'theme', 'parties', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'theme', 'party', 'example', 'wealthy', 'people', 'do', 'fact', 'appear', 'be', 'ridiculously', 'touch', 'real', 'painful', 'problems', 'poor', 'Just', 'one', 'woman', 'playing', 'golf', 'hitting', 'golf', 'ball', 'caught', 'camera', 'saying', 'poor', 'are', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'What', 'earth', 'was', 'SHE', 'doing', 'when', 'was', 'playing', 'golf', 'instead', 'maybe', 'doing', 'charity', 'work', 'less', 'fortunate', 'never', 'had', 'feeling', 'rich', 'people', 'highly', 'insulated', 'communities', 'Flint', 'ever', 'truly', 'understood', 'plight', 'poor', 'people.Unfortunately', 'equally', 'true', 'General', 'Motors', 'never', 'signed', 'contract', 'people', 'Flint', 'provide', 'jobs', 'health', 'insurance', 'cradle', 'grave', 'way', 'things', 'go', 'society', 'employer', 'can', 'end', 'employment', 'time', 'even', 'notice', 'believe', 'case', 'most', 'not', 'fifty', 'states', 'Naturally', 'not', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'great', 'great', 'empathy', 'sympathy', 'who', 'were', 'laid', 'off', 'just', 'when', 'GM', 'closed', 'eleven', 'plants', 'got', 'ugly', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'rough', 'type', 'non-contracted', 'employment', 'can', 'be.I', 'suppose', 'Moore', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'balanced', 'produce', 'solid', 'documentary', 'really', 'need', 'show', 'sides', 'story', 'Moore', 'accomplish', 'interviewing', 'friend', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'footage', 'Moore', 'give', 'man', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'care', 'less', 'General', 'Motors', 'employees.The', 'DVD', 'light', 'extras', 'do', 'get', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Michael', 'Moore.Overall', 'Roger', 'Me', 'times', 'sad', 'other', 'times', 'entertaining', 'see', 'portrait', 'just', 'how', 'harsh', 'free', 'enterprise', 'can', 'be', 'common', 'man', 'who', 'weekly', 'paycheck', 'survival', 'humor', 'do', 'get', 'not', 'bad', 'Moore', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'even', 'handed', 'presentation', 'issue', 'nevertheless', 'recommend', 'film', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'study', 'politics', 'political', 'science', 'work', 'related', 'issues', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'truly', 'concerned', 'plight', 'everyday', 'human', 'beings', 'working', 'poor', 'will', 'also', 'appreciate', 'movie']",Roger & Me VHS

Michael Moore is determined to get General Motors Chairman Roger Smith to come down to Flint and see the devastation his company has caused.  Of course, just trying to MEET the man throws all sorts of obstacles in Moore's way... and it's all caught on film!  All of this equals an entertaining documentary that is unpredictable and untamed.I'm not that big on documentaries, but I have to admit that I enjoyed this one.  Michael Moore does an excellent job of bringing to light problems that may seem so insignificant to the rest of the world.  And he's determined too, which is why this all works.  He tries so many times to get in touch with Roger, no matter what kind of trouble he runs into.  His passion is easily observed through this movie, that's for sure.The DVD isn't the grandest of DVDs.  It's not in widescreen, but for a movie like this it really isn't that big of a problem (I'm not even sure if this was originally shot in widescreen or not).  The picture and sound quality is pretty good, considering how old it is.  The theatrical trailer and commentary are the two special features on the DVD.  I think an important film of this caliber should've received better DVD treatment, but what can you do?  It is what it is.""Roger &amp; Me"" is a surprisingly witty and sharp documentary that shows you a side of Big Business that was never meant to be seen.  Coming from a guy who doesn't really fancy documentaries all that much, my advice to you is to pop this baby into the DVD player and strap yourself in for one wild ride.",4,"'O Roger, Where Art Thou??

At the time, thousands of people had been laid off by GM as plants closed all over Flint.  Yet the higher ups of GM, including former head chairman Roger Smith, were making massive profits.  So Michael Moore, with the inaugural usage of his in-your-face tactics, decided he needed to find Roger Smith and show him what was happening to Flint.Now, the movie is merely based on the idea of finding Roger, because much of the time is spent meeting local people, whether that be the Sheriff deputy who has to evict many of the people who formerly worked for GM, or whether it be the laid off workers themselves.Even considering how this was Michael Moore's first film it still has visual quality, even with low budget editing.  However, one must remember that the focus is the story itself, a story that was worth telling.Even now, though this story is old, it is still a great film to check out.  Simply put, times may change but layoffs linger.(Oh, and don't forget this is Moore's first film, so it is extra valuable for the Michael Moore fans out there.

Strangely, when a corporation makes a decision that guts an american city, some who worship at the altar of unfettered capitalism would cheer. ""Roger & Me"" is a film that shows how a bottom-line based decision of a corporate CEO can turn a once vibrant industrial city into a ghost town.It is an indignant film, as it should be. The victims of GM were not laid off because they were unproductive since GM was profitable. They were laid off because of greed. GM can no longer claim to be an American corporation when they would shut down an American city so they can have cheap labor off shore.Some have said that Michael Moore was obnoxious and disrespectful, but it can be argued that what Roger Smith did was far more obnoxious and disrespectful.Michael Moore uses humor to help viewers digest bitter realities of American life. In this case, the humor comes from the absurd advice given to laid off workers by city leaders and celebrities brought to ""bring them cheer."" The film is also heartbreaking and you will never listen to ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" by the Beach Boys the same way again. Some have criticized his intercutting the GM christmas party speech with a family getting kicked out of their homes on christmas eve as manipulative. Every day we are manipulated into believing that unfettered capitalism is American as apple pie, so we should forgive Moore for using manipulation on the behalf of the little guy -- the average joe.I recently watched this movie again in a background of the Enron scandal. This movie was remarkably fresh after all these years. This film has a scrappy feel to it, but it is brilliantly put together.I hope that you watch this movie and its follow up film ""Pets or Meat"". Read his books and he will have another movie opening in the Fall called ""Bowling for Columbine"" which will be just as controversial.

Narrated and produced by Mr. Moore, it examines the economic decline of his hometown, Flint, Michigan, due to the closing of several GM plants.  The name Roger refers to Roger Smith, the GM executive who was the force behind these closings.  The movie starts by showing Moore's childhood in Flint, and how the city grew rich on the automobile business.  Then came the announced closings.  The movie shows film footage from these events, such as the corporate announcements themselves, news footage both local and national, and reactions from Flint residents.  The movie then shows the gradual decline of the city such as store closings, bankruptcies, increased crime rates, and evictions of many citizens.  Throughout this decline, Mr. Moore tries to find Roger Smith so he can meet with him, and convince him to visit Flint.  Time and again Moore misses Roger, and the movie ends with him managing to confront Roger for several minutes at a banquet.Interspersed throughout the movie are scenes of the wealthy citizens of Flint and how they are totally disconnected from the middle class and laid-off workers of Flint.  Also interspersed is footage of the various ridiculous things Flint citizens do after GM leaves them, such as growing rabbits for meat.The point that this movie seems to be trying to convey is that GM closed the plants to reopen them in Mexico to boost profits, and not to postpone corporate losses.  It is here that movie is quite lacking in numbers and data.  For example, the movie should have shown the price of GM stock during this time frame, and also GM's profit line before and after the plant closings.  Another area where numbers would have helped is in showing Flint's decline.  The movie should have shown employment rates, city tax earnings, and crime rates in Flint before and after the plant closings.In conclusion, this is a good, but not great, muckraking movie.  It is worth watching as a historical piece, and lends insight into the economic decline of the Midwest and Northeast.",3,"Good first try, but lots of rookie mistakes",1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,2121,"['Roger', 'Me', 'debuted', '1988', 'turned', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'up-and-coming', 'star', 'populist', 'media', 'Narrated', 'produced', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'economic', 'decline', 'hometown', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'due', 'closing', 'several', 'GM', 'plants', 'name', 'Roger', 'refers', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'GM', 'executive', 'who', 'was', 'force', 'closings', 'movie', 'showing', 'Moore', 'childhood', 'Flint', 'how', 'city', 'grew', 'rich', 'automobile', 'business', 'Then', 'came', 'announced', 'closings', 'movie', 'film', 'footage', 'events', 'such', 'corporate', 'announcements', 'news', 'footage', 'local', 'national', 'reactions', 'Flint', 'residents', 'movie', 'then', 'gradual', 'decline', 'city', 'such', 'store', 'closings', 'bankruptcies', 'increased', 'crime', 'rates', 'evictions', 'many', 'citizens', 'decline', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'find', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'can', 'meet', 'convince', 'visit', 'Flint', 'Time', 'again', 'Moore', 'misses', 'Roger', 'movie', 'managing', 'confront', 'Roger', 'several', 'minutes', 'banquet.Interspersed', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'wealthy', 'citizens', 'Flint', 'how', 'are', 'totally', 'disconnected', 'middle', 'class', 'laid-off', 'workers', 'Flint', 'Also', 'interspersed', 'footage', 'various', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'Flint', 'citizens', 'do', 'GM', 'such', 'growing', 'rabbits', 'meat.The', 'point', 'movie', 'be', 'trying', 'convey', 'GM', 'closed', 'plants', 'reopen', 'Mexico', 'boost', 'profits', 'not', 'postpone', 'corporate', 'losses', 'here', 'movie', 'quite', 'lacking', 'numbers', 'data', 'example', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'shown', 'price', 'GM', 'stock', 'time', 'frame', 'also', 'GM', 'profit', 'line', 'plant', 'closings', 'area', 'where', 'numbers', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'showing', 'Flint', 'decline', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'shown', 'employment', 'rates', 'city', 'tax', 'earnings', 'crime', 'rates', 'Flint', 'plant', 'closings.In', 'conclusion', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'muckraking', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'historical', 'piece', 'insight', 'economic', 'decline', 'Midwest', 'Northeast']",Roger & Me VHS

The problems facing the people in this documentary are the same problems American families are facing today. Big corporations cutting corners so they can collect all the wealth and pay their employees practically nothing until one day they decide to lay everybody off and move to Mexico where they can pay people even less while the American people suffer. Watching people being evicted from their homes was heart breaking. Especially the women being kicked out on Christmas Eve with her small children watching. There is a huge gap between the wealthy and the poor in this country and it is growing. And places like Wal-Mart are only making things much worse.

Moore's film shows what happens when General Motors decides to close down its plant in Flint, Michigan.  30,000 people lose their jobs and Flint's economy plunges into depression.The film details Moore's attempt to get an interview with GM head Roger Smith to show him what he did to Flint.  Instead, Moore is given the run-around as he is informed that Smith is out, unavailable, or busy.Undaunted, Moore points his camera at the people of Flint to show us the viewers what GM did to Flint.  We are shown a man who suffered a mental breakdown after losing his job.  We are shown a spaced-out woman who has formed a most interesting business to ward off unemployment.  We are treated to pictures of the upper class living in complete oblivion to the poverty surrounding them (&quot;Get a job!&quot; one woman informs Moore).  We are informed that the crime rate has skyrocketed in Flint since the plant shut down.  But not to worry, this provides a new source of employment. Laid-off employees can now get jobs as security guards locking up their former co-workers.A few scenes that really stood out in my mind:  One was the way the sheriff goes from house to house evicting people with a bored expression on his face.  When Moore questions him about how he feels about doing this, the sheriff looks completely baffled.  Instead, he talks about how he is looking forward to his upcoming holiday.  Doesn't he realize he's on camera?  Another scene that stands out, the people of Flint trying to offset unemployment by developing a theme park dedicated to celebrating Flint's GM heritage.  When the park fails to attract tourists, the people are left looking pretty stupid.There's also that scene where Ronald Reagan shows up to treat the unemployed workers to pizza and give them a lecture about finding employment.  He then forgets to pick up the check.It's important to realize that GM didn't close the plant in Flint because they were in an economic downturn, but because they didn't want to spend a little extra money keeping people employed.  GM devastated Flint's economy so that the people at the top could get a little richer.  Moore's film transcends being just a revenge comedy and becomes a stinging indictment of the dark side of capitalism.You can't help but feel that Roger Smith would have been better off if he'd agreed to the interview.  Instead, Michael Moore chose to point his camera at Flint, giving Smith a much more damning indictment than an interview ever could.I'll be looking forward to seeing Moore's new film &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; when it's released in October.

262119,A1VA170GUYGTB,6301691687,Paula L. Craig,"[2, 2]","The film is a wonderful snapshot of the decline and fall of an American town.  The scenes of parties for Flint's rich folks and GM executives, interspersed with poor workers being evicted from their homes, are great.  I also loved seeing Reagan and hearing the Flint citizens talk about how he was going to bring the jobs back.  This is the President who put our country on the road to bankruptcy.Moore wants to save his home town and help people in poverty.  He's a sincere guy.  I'm less convinced that the proposals he has in mind would accomplish anything.  As I see it, the problem in Flint is not that GM is a bad corporate citizen, or that the government isn't doing enough to help the poor.  The real difficulty is that Flint's prosperity in the 50s and 60s was an illusion to begin with.  After the Second World War America chose to base its transportation system on the automobile.  This seemed to work OK for a while, because gasoline seemed to be plentiful and cheap.  Unfortunately, this approach to transportation had some nasty side effects.  It made our towns ugly and our people fat, not to mention changing the climate.  Today we're coming to the end of the era of cheap oil with the passing of Hubbert's peak.  Oil comes from millions of years' worth of stored sunlight, and when it's gone, it's gone.  In the next few decades getting around at all is going to become increasingly difficult.  We'll be wishing that we had invested in streetcar lines and walkable cities instead of all those freeways.  The automobile is still subsidized to the tune of billions of dollars in America today.  That's just money down a rat hole.For more perspective on the dominance of the automobile in American life, I would suggest Kunstler's books ""The Geography of Nowhere"" and ""The Long Emergency.""

Moore deliberately edited the scene in a way where it comes off that way. Often he takes quotes from interviewees out of context by letting parts end up on the cutting room floor. He himself admitted to this.- The failed mall, hotel and autoshow were closed down prior to the layoffs and are hence not the result of them.- Reagan visited Flynt in 1982 not in 1986 during the layoffs as claimed here.- Moore doesn't mention anything about the impossible requests by the unions, which ultimately led to the heads of GM to contemplate foreign assembly.- There are more reasons as to why the Academy Awards revoked an Oscar for Roger & ME, however I'm tired to waste any more time on this hypocritical, self absorbed former stockowner of Ely Lilly and Halliburton securities.Michael Moore bends the truth, cashes in, and thus is just as much of a journalistic failure as his greedy right wing counterpart.

Starting with a neo-conservative view, Paul saw that Ford did not practice free enterprise and often pursued suicidal strategies in the marketplace.In 1990, Michael Moore came out with his film &quot;Roger and Me&quot; showing the same suicidal behavior at Ford's biggest competitor - General Motors.  The film lacks Weaver's economic insights, but makes up for it with the best dry humor ever in a documentary that has created its own genre.  The British, reknown worldwide for their dry humour, are eating up everything Moore is spitting out.General Motors closed scores of profitable assembly and parts plants throughout the eighties, while keeping open unprofitable ones.  Moore's focus is on Flint, Michigan where GM's best cars were made - the Olds 88 and Buick LeSabre.  Moore is a Naderite, but never really analyzes why GM is closing down profitable operations.  So the viewer can only suspect that in the context of the increasing corporatism of the eighties and nineties, under the guise of free market rhetoric, that corporate machinations were designed to increase corporate power at the expense of other stake holders in the game.  Share holders, too, come across as a low priority in all of this.In short, an hilarious and timeless film that will always pick one up no matter how blue one feels from his or her daily encounters with the absurdities of life.

Moore's movie was one of the few to deal with massive corporate layoffs of the 80's, something that today is more relevant than ever.So the best way to judge Moore's film is to actually see it for yourself only to come to a sad conclusion that matters of corporate power and greed have only taken a turn for the worse from the time Roger and Me was released.",5,One of the best American documentaries...,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,730,"['Many', 'including', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'despise', 'Moore', 'what', 'trouble', 'maker', 'loudmouth', 'crude', 'times', 'egomaniacal', 'man', 'people', 'still', 'buy', 'tickets', 'see', 'films.If', 'someone', 'Moore', 'shed', 'light', 'topics', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'Roger', 'Me', 'easily', 'one', 'Moore', 'most', 'piercingly', 'honest', 'films', 'what', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Moore', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'deal', 'massive', 'corporate', 'layoffs', '80', 'something', 'today', 'more', 'relevant', 'ever.So', 'best', 'way', 'judge', 'Moore', 'film', 'actually', 'see', 'only', 'come', 'sad', 'conclusion', 'matters', 'corporate', 'power', 'greed', 'have', 'only', 'taken', 'turn', 'worse', 'time', 'Roger', 'Me', 'was', 'released']",Roger & Me VHS

262133,AJYGQV81FSFE2,6301691687,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[6, 9]","I had to start with a grabber. Sorry. Moore starts this masterpiece  with his childhood supposition that three people worked for GM, Pat Boone (whose career included hyping Chevrolet who provided him with a Corvette and a station wagon for his ever-growing family), a second person (not so relevant that I would remember him now) and Moore's dad.It's the third time I've seen this tape. I always liked it, but now, after I've been terminated from a terribly run corporationfor essentially disloyalty (&quot;A bad mix between corporate and you.&quot;), it struck a more familiar chord.Moore is a real Flint personality, though he said in the film that he felt he'd get out, like Grand Funk Railroad, Bob Eubanks and a few other choice Flint-born personalities. He left for California where he found that everyone has a job yet no one works. He was &quot;terminated&quot; from his job there as quickly as he could load his U-Haul and head back to Flint. But things had changed there.Michael reflects on the history of GM there. In 1937, his uncle was part of the 44 day strike from which the UAW was born. But today (i.e., the  making of the film), while the company is making record profits, factories are closing, to send the jobs South of the Border where workers make 70 cents an hour, to leave about 30,000 in Flint without work.Throughout the film, Michael was attempting to make contact with Roger Smith, the chairman of GM which is, needless to say the largest employer of the area. He and his crew went to the most elaborate suburbs (with enormous homes) of Flint where there were quite a few &quot;Smiths.&quot; They went to the country clubs and the society events, where the &quot;more fortunate&quot; in the area talked about how warm and cuddly the area is, and if the GM workers would just try, they could find another job. That attitude confirms my appraisal of &quot;conservatism, that &quot;I made it and if you didn't, there's something wrong with you and that's not my responsibility.&quot; Ironic that such an attitude nearly always comes from people who already have a great deal of money.The &quot;witnesses&quot; on whom Michael calls are amusing. I mean, did you know that, before she was a spokesperson for oranges, Anita Bryant was a great advertiser for GM? She rambles on too about how the people of Flint are so nice, they'll make it if they just try. And Bob Eubanks. Some friends were part of the audience of The Newlywed Game years ago and talked how crass Eubanks, a Flint native, was. He confirmed that in his role in this film. Then there's Pat Boone.After the entire community was failing, Flint built, at taxpayers' expense, a large hotel. Then, at even greater expense, they built the world's largest indoor theme park dedicated to the automobile. Inside a year both of them were closed.Back on the planet earth, people who had been GM employees were getting hired, then fired, from a Taco Bell, as prison guards (a growing profession, what with increased unemployment and destitution--therefore crime--in Flint. In all of these positions, they were making a fraction of what they made at GM. GM's lead PR man (laid off before the film was released) was praising the opportunities for people in Flint to make the locally produced lint-picker. This was something that Moore found, shall I say, challenging. Then there was the young woman who was trying to make a go of it by selling rabbits for food and pets, while she also raised Dobermans (Dobermen??) until the health department closed her down. There were the poor souls who went to &quot;give&quot; plasma a few times a week for a few bucks. And then there were the countless who were being evicted from their residences.While there is a witty element to the film, it's not a comedy--nor is it intended to be. Smith's inaccessbility was the recurring theme of the whole film. Toward the end, Smith is giving his Christmas speech, while Michael showed people being evicted on Christmas Eve. Moore finally had access to Smith by then and all Smith could say was that &quot;GM didn't evict them.&quot; Oh, and that's not long after Smith had given himself a $2 million raise.If nothing else, one needs to challenge the power of corporations in these days of globalization. Of course, we can challenge the media too who aren't in the least bit honest about these dismal facts. In the meantime, we need to thank Michael Moore for his series of documentaries, beginning with this one, who challenges the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; which is leading to disaster of which the majority is not yet aware.Oh, I think the last items in the credits speak millions: that &quot;This film cannot be shown in Flint, Michigan....All the movie theatres have closed.",5,What?

Unfortunately, for Michael Moore, there are so many people tied up in the political implications of his work that they fail to realize that &quot;Roger and Me&quot; is probably the best documentary film of all time in terms of style, content and presentation.This movie is an expose on General Motors closing of several plants in Michigan and the subsequent effects of those plant closings.  Nuff Said...It happened...so you can be pissed at GM for moving its factories to Tijuana where they can get workers for 33 cents/hour or, you can buy into Adam Smith's classical economic hypothesis put forth in &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; and think that GM did the rational thing.  The question is, how do you present this information to the uninformed world?In terms of style, Moore's narrative is historically rich and laced with deadpan sarcasm.  Many people have criticized the film for its &quot;biased&quot; presentation of fact.  Wake up!  This is not a CNN news broadcast, nor it it a press relase.  It is a documentary, and as such, it must have a thesis.  Moore presents a strong thesis: General Motors does not give a damn about suffering of American workers.  He backs it up with statistics and qualitative content in his narrative.  There is never a question left unanswered about why GM did what it did and what the official company line was on the issue.  For a good documentary to work, you see it has to fill in some blanks, therefore, the film should not be criticized for being &quot;biased&quot;.While the content of &quot;Roger and Me&quot; gives the viewer a healthy dose of the consequences of class-war, the true art is in the way that these consequences are presented.  In Roger and Me, Moore proves that he is the master of &quot;quick-cutting&quot; from the sublime to the shocking.  Such sharp edits have to be admired. For example, at one point Moore is interviewing some upper-class people in a beautiful pastoral setting.  They are talking about how people should &quot;take control of their situation&quot; if they do not have a job.  Then suddenly, the film cuts into to a run-down neighborhood where families are being evicted from their homes.  Moore uses this technique several times in Roger and Me cutting from the innocuous settings of the upper-class to the harsh realities of the working-class.  The effect is as devistating to the viewer as going 60 MPH and then running smack into a brick wall.While you may disagree with Moore's politics, people should at least appriciate what he has done for the documentary film-genre.",5,An unappreciated work of art.,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,2670,"['1993', 'took', 'graduate', 'seminar', 'documentary', 'film', 'making', 'was', 'introduced', 'quot', 'Roger', 'Me', 'quot', 'Unfortunately', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'tied', 'up', 'political', 'implications', 'work', 'fail', 'realize', 'quot', 'Roger', 'Me', 'quot', 'probably', 'best', 'documentary', 'film', 'time', 'terms', 'style', 'content', 'presentation.This', 'movie', 'expose', 'General', 'Motors', 'closing', 'several', 'plants', 'Michigan', 'subsequent', 'effects', 'plant', 'closings', 'Nuff', 'Said', 'happened', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'pissed', 'GM', 'moving', 'factories', 'Tijuana', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'workers', '33', 'cents/hour', 'can', 'buy', 'Adam', 'Smith', 'classical', 'economic', 'hypothesis', 'put', 'forth', 'quot', 'Wealth', 'Nations', 'quot', 'think', 'GM', 'did', 'rational', 'thing', 'question', 'how', 'do', 'present', 'information', 'uninformed', 'world', 'terms', 'style', 'Moore', 'narrative', 'historically', 'rich', 'laced', 'deadpan', 'sarcasm', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'quot', 'biased', 'quot', 'presentation', 'fact', 'Wake', 'up', 'not', 'CNN', 'news', 'broadcast', 'press', 'relase', 'documentary', 'such', 'must', 'have', 'thesis', 'Moore', 'strong', 'thesis', 'General', 'Motors', 'not', 'give', 'damn', 'suffering', 'American', 'workers', 'up', 'statistics', 'qualitative', 'content', 'narrative', 'never', 'question', 'left', 'unanswered', 'why', 'GM', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'what', 'official', 'company', 'line', 'was', 'issue', 'good', 'documentary', 'work', 'see', 'fill', 'blanks', 'therefore', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'criticized', 'being', 'quot', 'biased', 'quot', 'content', 'quot', 'Roger', 'Me', 'quot', 'viewer', 'healthy', 'dose', 'consequences', 'class-war', 'true', 'art', 'way', 'consequences', 'are', 'presented', 'Roger', 'Me', 'Moore', 'master', 'quot', 'quick-cutting', 'quot', 'sublime', 'shocking', 'Such', 'sharp', 'edits', 'have', 'be', 'admired', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'Moore', 'interviewing', 'upper-class', 'people', 'beautiful', 'pastoral', 'setting', 'are', 'talking', 'how', 'people', 'should', 'quot', 'take', 'control', 'situation', 'quot', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'job', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'film', 'cuts', 'run-down', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'families', 'are', 'being', 'evicted', 'homes', 'Moore', 'technique', 'several', 'times', 'Roger', 'Me', 'cutting', 'innocuous', 'settings', 'upper-class', 'harsh', 'realities', 'working-class', 'effect', 'devistating', 'viewer', 'going', '60', 'MPH', 'then', 'running', 'smack', 'brick', 'may', 'disagree', 'Moore', 'politics', 'people', 'should', 'least', 'appriciate', 'what', 'done', 'documentary', 'film-genre']",Roger & Me VHS
262135,ASJ89T42CIUHU,6301691687,V. Marshall,"[22, 29]","Controversial filmmaker Michael Moore made this documentary in 1989 but it is sadly still very pertinent for American life in 2004, it is still a tale of big corporations making a mountain of money at the expense of middle class and poor workers.Michael Moore is a pest, irritating and opinionated to the ninth degree but I admire him like no other, what other American is willing to take as many stabs at his reputation and just keep on filming the truth? I agree that some of his films have moments that go over the top for conservative Republican types but for us humble left wingers he remains one of our richest voices against the machine called ""corporate America."" Moore is thinner and youthful in this film from 1989 but he was just as badgering and willing to take a fall then as he is now. In this film he takes on the devastating affect that GM and its Chairman, Roger B. Smith make on the town of Flint, Michigan when they choose to close down the manufacturing plant located there. Moore is filmed in his many attempts to meet with Smith only to be met by constant refusals; it seems Smith wasn't able to stand up to his own heat! One subject in the film states that the corporate world is all about making money and this film brings that awful truth to a head as 18,000 workers loose their jobs in Flint, MI.Moore has a way of filming that sets forth the truth, adds a touch of humor and then stops your heart. He shows how the rich only get stronger, while under the blanket of corporate security, while the security the workers expect can be pulled out from underneath them before they have a chance to right themselves. GM was financially strong during the time this film was made but it still decided to lay off over 30,000 workers from several plants in America so that it could move the facilities to Mexico and only have to pay the new workers seven cents an hour.....well you just can't beat that, right? Amazingly so this very same issue is a forefront in today's political agenda, do we, or don't we? I believe Moore is trying to say no! When American workers suffer with layoffs and entire town devastations the rest of America eventually suffers as well, unless you live in a manor overlooking a lake and have the letters CEO attached to your name of course. Moore follows Roger B. Smith to private clubs and films a Christmas speech while intermittently showing the GM workers being physically evicted from their homes. Pretty powerful stuff!Many aspects of this film are significant, some of the cleverest scenes revolve around displaced workers trying to make ends meet and the continuous stream of people being forcibly evicted from scraps that they have made into homes. Where can the justice be in a woman with small children being taken from a home with a caved in roof, should rent really be paid on a rat hole? I can just imagine the landlord on Christmas day! Another scene that bothered me is one in which a woman tries to make a living by skinning her rabbits; it's a brutal scene and not one for animal lovers or anyone who disguises where the meat on their table came from. So the saga of Flint continues and hopefully the heart of Michael Moore will carry on until this very American problem is resolved, the middle class is becoming poor and the poor falling off the face of the earth into oblivion if we keep up what we are doing. For now we need Moore's unwavering voice to spread the bad news and hope for a better way because ""Roger"" could be coming to your town next.",4,Corporate vs. Real America,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,3514,"['Controversial', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'made', 'documentary', '1989', 'sadly', 'still', 'very', 'pertinent', 'American', 'life', '2004', 'still', 'tale', 'big', 'corporations', 'making', 'mountain', 'money', 'expense', 'middle', 'class', 'poor', 'workers.Michael', 'Moore', 'pest', 'irritating', 'opinionated', 'ninth', 'degree', 'admire', 'other', 'what', 'other', 'American', 'willing', 'take', 'many', 'stabs', 'reputation', 'just', 'keep', 'filming', 'truth', 'agree', 'films', 'have', 'moments', 'go', 'top', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'types', 'humble', 'left', 'wingers', 'one', 'richest', 'voices', 'machine', 'called', 'corporate', 'America', 'Moore', 'thinner', 'youthful', 'film', '1989', 'was', 'just', 'badgering', 'willing', 'take', 'fall', 'then', 'now', 'film', 'devastating', 'affect', 'GM', 'Chairman', 'Roger', 'B.', 'Smith', 'make', 'town', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'when', 'choose', 'close', 'down', 'manufacturing', 'plant', 'located', 'there', 'Moore', 'filmed', 'many', 'attempts', 'meet', 'Smith', 'only', 'be', 'met', 'constant', 'refusals', 'Smith', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'heat', 'One', 'subject', 'film', 'corporate', 'world', 'making', 'money', 'film', 'awful', 'truth', 'head', '18,000', 'workers', 'loose', 'jobs', 'Flint', 'MI.Moore', 'way', 'filming', 'sets', 'forth', 'truth', 'touch', 'humor', 'then', 'stops', 'heart', 'how', 'rich', 'only', 'get', 'stronger', 'blanket', 'corporate', 'security', 'security', 'workers', 'expect', 'can', 'be', 'pulled', 'out', 'underneath', 'have', 'chance', 'right', 'GM', 'was', 'financially', 'strong', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'still', 'decided', 'lay', 'off', '30,000', 'workers', 'several', 'plants', 'America', 'could', 'move', 'facilities', 'Mexico', 'only', 'have', 'pay', 'new', 'workers', 'seven', 'cents', 'hour', '..well', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'right', 'Amazingly', 'very', 'same', 'issue', 'forefront', 'today', 'political', 'agenda', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Moore', 'trying', 'say', 'no', 'When', 'American', 'workers', 'suffer', 'layoffs', 'entire', 'town', 'devastations', 'rest', 'America', 'eventually', 'as', 'well', 'live', 'manor', 'overlooking', 'lake', 'have', 'letters', 'CEO', 'attached', 'name', 'course', 'Moore', 'Roger', 'B.', 'Smith', 'private', 'clubs', 'films', 'Christmas', 'speech', 'intermittently', 'showing', 'GM', 'workers', 'being', 'physically', 'evicted', 'homes', 'Pretty', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'Many', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'significant', 'cleverest', 'scenes', 'revolve', 'around', 'displaced', 'workers', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'continuous', 'stream', 'people', 'being', 'forcibly', 'evicted', 'scraps', 'have', 'made', 'homes', 'Where', 'can', 'justice', 'be', 'woman', 'small', 'children', 'being', 'taken', 'home', 'caved', 'roof', 'should', 'rent', 'really', 'be', 'paid', 'rat', 'hole', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'landlord', 'Christmas', 'day', 'scene', 'bothered', 'one', 'woman', 'make', 'living', 'skinning', 'rabbits', 'brutal', 'scene', 'not', 'one', 'animal', 'lovers', 'anyone', 'who', 'where', 'meat', 'table', 'came', 'saga', 'Flint', 'hopefully', 'heart', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'will', 'carry', 'very', 'American', 'problem', 'resolved', 'middle', 'class', 'becoming', 'poor', 'poor', 'falling', 'off', 'face', 'earth', 'oblivion', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'now', 'need', 'Moore', 'unwavering', 'voice', 'spread', 'bad', 'news', 'hope', 'better', 'way', 'Roger', 'could', 'be', 'coming', 'town', 'next']",Roger & Me VHS

This movie explores the devistating effects on GM's outsourcing on Flint, Michigan. This movie is better than I was anticipating- it is a very good documentary that makes you feel angry at GM and sad for Flint, Michigan and their desperate attempts to revive the city with such attractions such as the $100 million Autoworld indoor theme park. I would like to see Flint today to see what the town is like now- hopefully better than it was in this documentary. The only part of the movie I didn't like was when they showed the killing of the rabbit. That part could of been left out. (I guess they put that in to show some of the weird things some people would do to get by). This is a great yet now outdated film that I would reccommend watching- highly reccommended!
