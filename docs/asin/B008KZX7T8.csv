1569699,AOB5695UUUJ0,B008KZX7T8,"Anime Lover ""D""","[5, 10]","This is a cross of Girls Bravo and Maria+Holic with a bit of Okami-san tossed in.  Our hero, Kinjiro Sakamachi, is one who is so afraid of girls the a single touch gives him major nosebleeds (but given that he has been used as a training dummy by his World champion fighting mother and his sister who is training to beat her even you would do anything to get them to stop).  Not to mention that when you put his name in traditional form the word Chicken is revealed, but that changes when he accidentally walks in on the butler(Subaru Konoe) to the daughter of the headmaster in the restroom and discovers that he is actually - well let us say that ""he"" has a few different options than normal butlers.  But when they learn on his phobia, they offer a deal, help them keep the secret so her butler can become a butler despite being a girl, and they will help him get over his gynophobia.  Throw in his crazy fight club sister, a cat eared, glasses wearing, busty blonde, a girl that has ghosts pop up all over the place, and Konoe's father who is NOT at all pleased with the relationship bewteen the two of them, can he man up to not only keep a secret but maybe find out that girls are not so bad.edit:  i finished the series recently (delayed due to going to gen con indy) and I have to say it was a great series.  the charatcers are funny in their interactions and the story does keep the pace well and keeps up with the comedy, but tugs at the heart as well as you get drawn into the struggle Konoe and Jiiro have with each other.  Ecchi level is low to mid - Kampfer would be the closest to it.  And with the ending, the idea of a second season is not out of the question.  I definate must have for those who likes an Ecchi psudeo-harem romantic comedy.",5,Chicken meets Butler,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,1758,"['cross', 'Girls', 'Bravo', 'Maria+Holic', 'bit', 'Okami-san', 'tossed', 'hero', 'Kinjiro', 'Sakamachi', 'one', 'who', 'so', 'afraid', 'girls', 'single', 'touch', 'major', 'nosebleeds', 'given', 'been', 'used', 'training', 'dummy', 'World', 'champion', 'fighting', 'mother', 'sister', 'who', 'training', 'beat', 'even', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'stop', 'Not', 'mention', 'when', 'put', 'name', 'traditional', 'form', 'word', 'Chicken', 'revealed', 'changes', 'when', 'accidentally', 'butler', 'Subaru', 'Konoe', 'daughter', 'headmaster', 'restroom', 'discovers', 'actually', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'few', 'different', 'options', 'normal', 'butlers', 'when', 'learn', 'phobia', 'offer', 'deal', 'help', 'keep', 'secret', 'butler', 'can', 'become', 'butler', 'being', 'girl', 'will', 'help', 'get', 'gynophobia', 'Throw', 'crazy', 'fight', 'club', 'sister', 'cat', 'eared', 'wearing', 'busty', 'blonde', 'girl', 'ghosts', 'pop', 'up', 'place', 'Konoe', 'father', 'who', 'NOT', 'pleased', 'relationship', 'bewteen', 'two', 'can', 'man', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'keep', 'secret', 'maybe', 'find', 'out', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'bad.edit', 'i', 'finished', 'series', 'recently', 'delayed', 'due', 'going', 'gen', 'con', 'indy', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'charatcers', 'are', 'funny', 'interactions', 'story', 'keep', 'pace', 'well', 'up', 'comedy', 'tugs', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'drawn', 'struggle', 'Konoe', 'Jiiro', 'have', 'other', 'Ecchi', 'level', 'low', 'mid', 'Kampfer', 'would', 'be', 'closest', 'ending', 'idea', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'question', 'definate', 'must', 'have', 'who', 'likes', 'Ecchi', 'psudeo-harem', 'romantic', 'comedy']",N/A

1569704,A28QLWDGTKXNHN,B008KZX7T8,Kenshin90991,"[5, 9]","Let me first start by saying that I love Mayo Chiki as a show when it first aired and I still do now. The reason for the 2 stars is NOT because of the show which is a good to average ROMCOM, it has a great plot although a bit predictable. Overall its a fun story to watch every now and then.Now the reason I rated this product down is because of the delivery. Sentai who currently hold the license to Mayo Chiki released this product on 02 OCT 2012, a little over one year after the initial airing, now I'm glad that this show was licensed and made available in the US and i'm aware that not everything can be dubbed, I bought this product as a fan however my first complaint is that its only on DVD and has no dub. If you catch this item on sale its not to bad but if memory serves me this product was initially released for 40 dollars, that's an insane price when you consider that one you're not getting dual audio (a english and japanese dub) and its on DVD. This may not seem like much but when considering other options for example I was able to secure The World God Only Knows for 36 dollars on Blu ray with dual audio. Yes this product is significantly cheaper than its Japanese Counter part (the blu ray for 3 eps costs roughly 60 dollars) however when considering the average pricing for anime in America it is abnormally high for the content received.My 2nd problem with it is for a commercial product there are a large amount of grammatical errors in the subtitles, at one point I couldn't help but wonder if I had purchased a bootleg from Ebay. This is very disappointing as you would figure since there is no dub to arrange the subs would be of a better quality. They are in giant yellow letters and while they aren't too distracting they definitely don't scream high quality.My 3rd and final problem with the disk is the Audio. Above I mentioned that this dvd feels like a bootleg, well the audio from episodes 6, maybe earlier, and on sounded unbalanced, cheap, and muffled. For Dolby Digital Audio, even with surround sound headphones, the audio quality felt sub-par and sometime absolutely annoying.I really wanted to like this product as this isn't the first time Sentai has done this, ie Princess Resurrection which eventually got a dub. The show is one that I would love to revisit at any given time and I should note that there are some uncensored scenes that were zoomed in during the initial broadcast. However, Sentai has proven to me that I should wait for a blu ray release with a dub before buying anything from them, I really wanted to be able to support localization like this but when the overall quality is almost akin to a bootleg I can't help but feel disappointed.My final recommendation for this is to wait for another release in either blu ray or dvd with a Dub, this show is great and deserves every penny however this product does it no justice. If you absolutely must have it or know Japanese then its not too bad, the overall picture quality is pretty good and although the audio does sound cheap I personally believe buying to support a show is always the best way to go.",2,Indicative of a Lack of Quality,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,3113,"['Let', 'first', 'start', 'saying', 'love', 'Mayo', 'Chiki', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'still', 'do', 'now', 'reason', '2', 'stars', 'NOT', 'show', 'good', 'average', 'ROMCOM', 'great', 'plot', 'bit', 'predictable', 'Overall', 'fun', 'story', 'watch', 'now', 'then.Now', 'reason', 'rated', 'product', 'down', 'delivery', 'Sentai', 'who', 'currently', 'hold', 'license', 'Mayo', 'Chiki', 'released', 'product', '02', 'OCT', '2012', 'little', 'one', 'year', 'initial', 'airing', 'now', ""'m"", 'glad', 'show', 'was', 'licensed', 'made', 'available', 'US', 'i', ""'m"", 'aware', 'not', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'dubbed', 'bought', 'product', 'fan', 'however', 'first', 'complaint', 'only', 'DVD', 'dub', 'catch', 'item', 'sale', 'not', 'bad', 'memory', 'product', 'was', 'initially', 'released', '40', 'dollars', 'insane', 'price', 'when', 'consider', 'one', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'dual', 'audio', 'english', 'japanese', 'dub', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'much', 'when', 'considering', 'other', 'options', 'example', 'was', 'able', 'secure', 'World', 'God', 'Only', 'Knows', '36', 'dollars', 'Blu', 'ray', 'dual', 'audio', 'Yes', 'product', 'significantly', 'cheaper', 'Japanese', 'Counter', 'part', 'blu', 'ray', '3', 'eps', 'roughly', '60', 'dollars', 'however', 'when', 'considering', 'average', 'pricing', 'anime', 'America', 'abnormally', 'high', 'content', '2nd', 'problem', 'commercial', 'product', 'are', 'large', 'amount', 'grammatical', 'errors', 'subtitles', 'one', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'had', 'purchased', 'bootleg', 'Ebay', 'very', 'disappointing', 'would', 'figure', 'dub', 'arrange', 'subs', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'quality', 'are', 'giant', 'yellow', 'letters', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'distracting', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'scream', 'high', 'quality.My', '3rd', 'final', 'problem', 'disk', 'Audio', 'mentioned', 'dvd', 'feels', 'bootleg', 'well', 'audio', 'episodes', '6', 'maybe', 'earlier', 'sounded', 'unbalanced', 'cheap', 'muffled', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Audio', 'even', 'surround', 'sound', 'headphones', 'audio', 'quality', 'felt', 'sub-par', 'sometime', 'absolutely', 'annoying.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'product', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'Sentai', 'done', 'ie', 'Princess', 'Resurrection', 'eventually', 'got', 'dub', 'show', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'revisit', 'given', 'time', 'should', 'note', 'are', 'uncensored', 'scenes', 'were', 'zoomed', 'initial', 'broadcast', 'However', 'Sentai', 'proven', 'should', 'wait', 'blu', 'ray', 'release', 'dub', 'buying', 'anything', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'able', 'support', 'localization', 'when', 'overall', 'quality', 'almost', 'akin', 'bootleg', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'disappointed.My', 'final', 'recommendation', 'wait', 'release', 'blu', 'ray', 'dvd', 'Dub', 'show', 'great', 'penny', 'however', 'product', 'justice', 'absolutely', 'must', 'have', 'know', 'Japanese', 'then', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'overall', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'audio', 'sound', 'cheap', 'personally', 'believe', 'buying', 'support', 'show', 'always', 'best', 'way', 'go']",N/A

It is a very common theme and apparently Japan can't get enough of it. The shows tend to go in spurts when it comes to main characters being one or the other. More often you'll have shows with just a butler or maid as a secondary character. Mayo Chiki aired during one of these seasons where butlers and maids were taking more of a forefront.Why am I mentioning all this? Because Mayo Chiki just happened to be one of the shows in that season that actually wasn't bad. It stood out enough to leave a nice enough memory. Other shows when I see maids or butlers tend to cause the usual sigh at their overuse of such generic characters. Yet for Chiki, I gave it a shot based on the synopsis back then.Mayo Chiki stands out not because it is a harem with butlers and maids but because it is a harem with a gynophobic protagonist. It isn't some girl crazy guy or an indifferent dull guy with a head so thick he couldn't figure out girls liked him even if they were all over him.To not spoil it much, he had a lot of trauma growing up involving females in his family. This causes his body to react negatively when one touches him. Thus enters into the picture Subaru the butler, of another student, who is actually a girl hiding her gender. Her reasons are strong for hiding it and with her comes the rest of the supporting cast who makes his life much more interesting.The story itself is rather decent. You will have a general idea how it will end but it is enjoyable. As mentioned, it stands out among similar anime. But the characters are pretty generic with a lot of basic fanservice gags. This is why I would knock off some points. Some episodes use the fanservice bits in far too predictable ways. At times I found myself wishing they'd just move the story along.Then you have the common butler themes used in this which do impact the enjoyment if you've seen far too much anime like me. However, when the series finally comes to a close...it doesn't feel like a complete waste of time. A sequel would be welcome. But as for a purchase recommendation...I'd give a thumb up if you are a fan of harem or romantic comedy anime. If not, give it a rental. The series is short so it will not take long to get through it.This doesn't appear to be a Funimation release so be ready to read subs. Beyond that it is up to you whether you like it or not. I can honestly say it was worth the time spent when I saw it airing. I also did look forward to new episodes back then.Hopefully that gives you all a better idea about it without spoiling it before a purchase.",4,Harem anime meets gynophobia...and...butlers..,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,2729,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'anime', 'world', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'probably', '1', '2', 'likely', 'few', 'hundred', 'shows', 'have', 'butlers', 'maids', 'form', 'very', 'common', 'theme', 'apparently', 'Japan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'shows', 'tend', 'go', 'spurts', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'being', 'one', 'other', 'More', 'often', ""'ll"", 'have', 'shows', 'just', 'butler', 'maid', 'secondary', 'character', 'Mayo', 'Chiki', 'aired', 'one', 'seasons', 'where', 'butlers', 'maids', 'were', 'taking', 'more', 'forefront.Why', 'am', 'mentioning', 'Mayo', 'Chiki', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'one', 'shows', 'season', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'stood', 'out', 'enough', 'leave', 'nice', 'enough', 'memory', 'Other', 'shows', 'when', 'see', 'maids', 'butlers', 'tend', 'cause', 'usual', 'sigh', 'overuse', 'such', 'generic', 'characters', 'Chiki', 'gave', 'shot', 'based', 'synopsis', 'back', 'then.Mayo', 'Chiki', 'out', 'not', 'harem', 'butlers', 'maids', 'harem', 'gynophobic', 'protagonist', ""n't"", 'girl', 'crazy', 'guy', 'indifferent', 'dull', 'guy', 'head', 'so', 'thick', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'girls', 'liked', 'even', 'were', 'him.To', 'not', 'spoil', 'much', 'had', 'lot', 'trauma', 'growing', 'up', 'involving', 'females', 'family', 'body', 'react', 'negatively', 'when', 'one', 'Thus', 'enters', 'picture', 'Subaru', 'butler', 'student', 'who', 'actually', 'girl', 'hiding', 'gender', 'reasons', 'are', 'strong', 'hiding', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'life', 'much', 'more', 'interesting.The', 'story', 'rather', 'decent', 'will', 'have', 'general', 'idea', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'enjoyable', 'mentioned', 'out', 'similar', 'anime', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'generic', 'lot', 'basic', 'fanservice', 'gags', 'why', 'would', 'knock', 'off', 'points', 'episodes', 'use', 'fanservice', 'bits', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'ways', 'times', 'found', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'just', 'move', 'story', 'along.Then', 'have', 'common', 'butler', 'themes', 'used', 'do', 'impact', 'enjoyment', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'anime', 'However', 'when', 'series', 'finally', 'close', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'purchase', 'recommendation', ""'d"", 'give', 'thumb', 'up', 'are', 'fan', 'harem', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'anime', 'not', 'give', 'rental', 'series', 'short', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'get', 'it.This', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'Funimation', 'release', 'so', 'be', 'ready', 'read', 'subs', 'up', 'not', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'time', 'spent', 'when', 'saw', 'airing', 'also', 'did', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'episodes', 'back', 'then.Hopefully', 'better', 'idea', 'spoiling', 'purchase']",N/A
