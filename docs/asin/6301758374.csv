This movie would have done better at the box office if it had been cleaned up some because the story is the kind that children like.  While this movie has no nudity it does have some bad language and sexual discussions that are inappropriate for children and are probably why it received an ""R"" rating.I enjoyed this movie for its advertisements which show the power of truth.  I teach marketing at the University of Southern Mississippi and use this movie in my class to introduce several ideas about the art of marketing communications.  Everyone howls at the ads and it is very popular with my students.But... you kind of have to enjoy Dudley Moore's type of humor to sit through the whole movie at one time.  I personally find his movies to be tedious but that is just me.  For instance, while the ads are funny this movie raises some questions.  Why are any of these people in an asylum (they don't look dangerous)?  Are Crazy People really smarter than the rest of us?  Would these types of truthful advertisements actually increase sales?In short, it is a shame that this movie had to have a plot to hang the advertisements on.  Taking the serious parts of this movie seriously is a big mistake.  So enjoy it for what it is, a silly little comedy with a romantic twist.

The basic premise of this film is that an advertising executive, Emery (played by Dudley Moore), decides that he wants to be honest and stop lying to the public. He is sent to a mental hospital, and thought to have had a nervous breakdown, when he presents his newest brainstorms to his boss. In the meantime, his ads get printed in error, which are an overnight sensation. The CEO of the advertisement company decides that Emery is an advertising genius and the fun begins, as Emery and his fellow mental patients write the most hillarious commercials you can imagine.  There are some silly parts to this film, but you will not be able to stop laughing at the ads written by the crazy people.  Darryl Hannah also stars in this film. In addition, there is a great character in this film that is a particular favorite of mine. I refer to him as the ""Hello"" man. He is one of the mental patients who writes commercials. He resembles Larry of the Three Stooges and his favorite word is ""Hello"". I won't spoil it for you, but keep your eye on him, he is a riot.

His most recent ideas (for movies scary enough to [mess] you up, for boxy but safe Volvos, and for the tourism boards of countries a whole lot friendlier than France) are enough to see him committed to an idyllic  sanitorium.  Meeting with other ""crazy people"" like him, Moore's character not only fails to curb his new compulsive honesty, but spreads it around, turning the asylum into some new age marketing firm.  When Moore's ideas, accidentally published, become unexpected marketing coups, his former colleagues visit his asylum and take creative nods from his newer colleagues, making the new pathological honesty in advertising the rule of thumb (like men buying cars or traveling to exotic destinations only for sexual favors they receive from women they don't know, or buying cigarettes because lung cancer isn't as definate as the great taste).  This was a surprisingly fun movie, funny but innocuous.  The script gives Moore's supporting cast some definate pathologies, but doesn't make them pitiable or outright laughable.
