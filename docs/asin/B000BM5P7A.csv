This is great, it has many REAL life lessons, it has all ages acting in it, so it will attract all ages too. We care to have clean movies with good lessons so we can all watch as a family. My teen age children did not want to watch it in the beginning, but once they saw the first episode they asked me to get the whole seasons. We are in the fifth season now and it is so nice and heartwarming  when we all gather as a family and watch one episode every night.",5,"We all love it, heartwarming",1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,543,"['like', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'will', 'like', 'even', 'more', 'great', 'many', 'REAL', 'life', 'lessons', 'ages', 'acting', 'will', 'attract', 'ages', 'too', 'care', 'have', 'clean', 'movies', 'good', 'lessons', 'can', 'watch', 'family', 'teen', 'age', 'children', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'beginning', 'once', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'asked', 'get', 'whole', 'seasons', 'are', 'fifth', 'season', 'now', 'so', 'nice', 'heartwarming', 'when', 'gather', 'family', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'night']",Wind at My Back - Season 02

My family and I look forward to our time spent together watching this show that consistantly proves itself to be endearing,entertaining, thought provoaking and wonderful.

My husband heartily agreed for he said I had him hooked on this series.This series is very entertaining and the characters feel like family in no time at all and you find you would like to live in this small town.  Although the New Bedford setting may seem like a much simpler time than our hectic lives of today, there are still plenty of trials to be overcome and the need to stand up for the right thing when the wrong choice seems so much easier at the time.",5,HOOKED BY THE FIRST SEASON OF WIND AT MY BACK,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,596,"['way', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'Wind', 'My', 'Back', 'was', 'clicking', 'away', 'computer', 'order', 'second', 'season', 'husband', 'heartily', 'agreed', 'said', 'had', 'hooked', 'series.This', 'series', 'very', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'feel', 'family', 'time', 'find', 'would', 'like', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'Bedford', 'setting', 'may', 'seem', 'much', 'simpler', 'time', 'hectic', 'lives', 'today', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'trials', 'be', 'overcome', 'need', 'stand', 'up', 'right', 'thing', 'when', 'wrong', 'choice', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'time']",Wind at My Back - Season 02

If you were a child of the forties or fifties you had to run and play and imagine.  What better childhood could anyone have had. Growing up with ""it's the right thing to do"" and a conscience of all things. I would always want to know a person like that.  Anyway, that's my take on it.
