885044,A1BB84E2QO5U2A,B0007ORE1W,Jack,"[16, 17]","A very fine performance of a wonderful opera. I agree that the sound could have been more consistent, there are occasions where the voices seem to fade out. The sets and costumes are teriffic. Redkin does come off as stiff and aloof at first, one does wonder why Tatyana fell in love with him. But he becomes more human as the story unfolds. Gavrilova's voice takes a little time to unfold but her performance in the letter scene could not have been better. I had to repeat the entire scene (one of the nice things about DVD). Baskov, like Redkin, is a little stiff in the openiing scene and, throughout, it sounds to my ears that, on occasion, some of his notes are not on pitch. By the scene at the ball, though, he is in excellent form, vocal and dramatic, he and Redkin are chilling during their falling out. I'm always puzzled a bit during this scene. It revolves around Lensky and Onegin vis-a-vis Olga and yet Olga is mostly unseen and unheard. What was she thinking when she realizes that what she thought was harmless flirting with Onegin has brought about the chilling remarks of Lensky about Onegin, his closet friend and his damnation of his former love, Olga. The only reaction we see is that of Tatyana.",5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1217,"['very', 'fine', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'opera', 'agree', 'sound', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'consistent', 'are', 'occasions', 'where', 'voices', 'seem', 'fade', 'out', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'teriffic', 'Redkin', 'come', 'off', 'stiff', 'aloof', 'first', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'Tatyana', 'fell', 'love', 'more', 'human', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Gavrilova', 'voice', 'little', 'time', 'unfold', 'performance', 'letter', 'scene', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'repeat', 'entire', 'scene', 'one', 'nice', 'things', 'DVD', 'Baskov', 'Redkin', 'little', 'stiff', 'openiing', 'scene', 'ears', 'occasion', 'notes', 'are', 'not', 'pitch', 'scene', 'ball', 'though', 'excellent', 'form', 'vocal', 'dramatic', 'Redkin', 'are', 'chilling', 'falling', 'out', ""'m"", 'always', 'puzzled', 'bit', 'scene', 'Lensky', 'Onegin', 'vis-a-vis', 'Olga', 'yet', 'Olga', 'mostly', 'unseen', 'unheard', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'harmless', 'flirting', 'Onegin', 'brought', 'chilling', 'remarks', 'Lensky', 'Onegin', 'closet', 'friend', 'damnation', 'former', 'love', 'Olga', 'only', 'reaction', 'see', 'Tatyana']",N/A

Camhi,"[2, 2]","I saw this on the 15 inch screen of my computer, and I saw the Metropolitan Opera HD series production with Renee Fleming (also on sale at Amazon) in a movie theater. The Met production is excellent, but this production so much better, even on my little computer. It isn't even close. Of course, in the Met production, Fleming is wonderful, but so is Maria Gavrilova in this production, and she is more age-appropriate than Fleming.  The picture on the DVD cover does not do Gavrilova justice: she is far more attractive in the video, in my opinion.  She also sings beautifully. In fact, all the singers are wonderful in this production, and the leads are more age-appropriate than the at the Met.  While the Met production is overly sparse and symbolic, this one is traditional and lush with beautiful realistic sets and costumes. In addition, the dancing in this production is amazing. After all, this is the Bolshoi, and the dancing is done by professional dancers.  When the peasants dance in this production, they do beautiful difficult traditional Russian dances perfectly.  When the peasants dance at the Met, they hold hands and go around in a circle. If I remember correctly, there is one professional dance scene in the Met production, but here every dance scene is expertly done. The beautiful music, singing, dancing, sets, and costumes make this one of my favorite opera DVDs.",5,Much Better than the Met Production,1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,1389,"['saw', '15', 'inch', 'screen', 'computer', 'saw', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'HD', 'series', 'production', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'also', 'sale', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'theater', 'Met', 'production', 'excellent', 'production', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'even', 'little', 'computer', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'course', 'Met', 'production', 'Fleming', 'wonderful', 'so', 'Maria', 'Gavrilova', 'production', 'more', 'age-appropriate', 'Fleming', 'picture', 'DVD', 'cover', 'not', 'do', 'Gavrilova', 'justice', 'far', 'more', 'attractive', 'video', 'opinion', 'also', 'beautifully', 'fact', 'singers', 'are', 'wonderful', 'production', 'leads', 'are', 'more', 'age-appropriate', 'Met', 'Met', 'production', 'overly', 'sparse', 'symbolic', 'one', 'traditional', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'realistic', 'sets', 'costumes', 'addition', 'dancing', 'production', 'amazing', 'Bolshoi', 'dancing', 'done', 'professional', 'dancers', 'When', 'peasants', 'dance', 'production', 'do', 'beautiful', 'difficult', 'traditional', 'Russian', 'dances', 'perfectly', 'When', 'peasants', 'dance', 'Met', 'hold', 'hands', 'go', 'around', 'circle', 'remember', 'correctly', 'one', 'professional', 'dance', 'scene', 'Met', 'production', 'here', 'dance', 'scene', 'expertly', 'done', 'beautiful', 'music', 'singing', 'dancing', 'sets', 'costumes', 'make', 'one', 'favorite', 'opera', 'DVDs']",N/A
885046,A2PAD826IH1HFE,B0007ORE1W,J Scott Morrison,"[26, 28]","This 2 DVD set is from a 2000 production at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. It reproduces a legendary production by Boris Pokrovsky from the same theater done in 1944. The sets and costumes are new but based on those of the historic production. It is entirely naturalistic - none of that awkward (and sometimes grotesque) updating so popular in European productions these days - and is a gorgeous mounting. It is led by one of the most-respected Russian conductors, Mark Ermler. The only concern I might have, reviewing it as I am doing in early April 2005, is the knowledge that another DVD of 'Onegin' from Russia, from the Kirov Theater in St. Petersburg, with better-known singers and with conductor Yuri Temirkanov, is due for release in a month's time. Obviously I haven't seen that one and cannot make a comparison. Nonetheless, I am quite satisfied with this version. It is true to both Tchaikovsky's and Pushkin's vision. I have loved Pushkin's verse novel for forty years, and Tchaikovsky's opera for nearly that long. Considering the length and complexity of Pushkin's book, it is a marvel of concision that Tchaikovsky (and his fellow librettist, his brother Modest) wrought. These seven 'lyrical scenes' convey the thrust of Pushkin's novel effectively, and the music is among the loveliest for any opera.The singers are quite fine. Maria Gavrilova, as Tatyana, takes a little while to warm up, but by the Letter Scene she is in wonderful form. And she gets better as the opera proceeds. Her growth from bookish, romance-besotted girl to married Princess in Act III is convincingly portrayed. Vladimir Redkin as Onegin has a fine voice and an effective stage presence. I just wish he had a bit more charisma; that would make Tatyana's falling in love with him at first sight a bit more believable. However, his gentle, but somewhat condescending, rebuff of Tatyana in Act I is nicely done, and by Act III his contrition and heartbreak are convincing. Mezzo Yelena Novak makes a good Olga although her girlishness is a bit overdone. The voice, though, is lush. Nikolai Baskov's Lensky is a bit of a simp, but then that's actually true to Pushkin's characterization and Tchaikovsky underlines that with Lensky's famous 'Ya lyublyu vas' in Act I, setting its conventional poetry to pedestrian music, a touch of Pushkinian irony. Baskov ('Kuda, kuda') is touching in the duel scene. And in that scene we are treated to the glorious bass voice of Alexander Korotky as Zaretsky, Onegin's second. Finally, in Act III, Tatyana's husband Prince Gremin is touchingly (and stunningly) sung by bass Aik Martirosyan; his aria about how much he loves his wife brings a lump to one's throat.The Bolshoi audience gave enthusiastic applause for the scenery of the ball scene of Act II, and again to the ballroom in Scene I of Act III, and rightly so. They were beautiful and complimented by the costumes of the women in elegant gowns and the men in handsome military uniforms.All in all, this is a wonderful production. Sound is a little muffled in Scene I, but gets much better and is quite fine for the rest of the opera. Ermler conducts effectively and aside from an occasional ensemble problem, the orchestra is excellent. The principal horn, who gets quite a workout through the entire opera, must be singled out as exceptional.Sound: Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1, or LPCM Stereo.
