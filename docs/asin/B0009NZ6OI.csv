909235,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0009NZ6OI,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I love movies based on true stories.Marlo Thomas plays Marie Bartello, later Marie Balter, who was hospitalized for over 20 years in a psychiatric facility, but pulled herself up and is now running a half-way house and acting as a patient advocate for the mentally ill.Ray Baker plays Joe Balter, and you can tell from the name that they were eventually married. Their love story is a tender one, but it is not the main focus of the movie.A major hero in the story is Dr. Blackwell (Carolina Kava), who was Marie's primary physician. Through her, we learn something of Marie's childhood and how she got to have this overwhelming anxiety psychosis. She had been raised in a convent orphanage, and then adopted by the Bartellos, an old-fashioned Italian-American family that terrorized her. Her mother would lock her out of the house ""to teach her a lesson,"" and when she was 16, she went pounding on the door of a psychiatric hospital for lack of anywhere to go. She attempted suicide any number of times, was put on the locked ward for violent patients for awhile, until Dr. Blackwell rescued her and worked to get her medications adjusted so she could function.The interesting thing is, the movie goes into a good bit of detail on the nature of her therapy, the steps taken to gradually move her out into the ""real"" world, and they parallel much of my own experiences with the psychiatric world. In the end, the critical factor is people willing to trust her and give her opportunities. However much we may say the patient has to do the work, it takes people willing to help, to trust, to love, to listen. Awareness of that fact, and how lucky she had been in her own recovery, Marie eventually went to college and became a professional. The final scene is her returning to the hospital to give a lecture as a patient advocate.",4,Very Disturbing Drama Raises Some Uncomfortable Questions,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1828,"['love', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'stories.Marlo', 'Thomas', 'Marie', 'Bartello', 'later', 'Marie', 'Balter', 'who', 'was', 'hospitalized', '20', 'years', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'pulled', 'up', 'now', 'running', 'half-way', 'house', 'acting', 'patient', 'advocate', 'mentally', 'ill.Ray', 'Baker', 'Joe', 'Balter', 'can', 'tell', 'name', 'were', 'eventually', 'married', 'love', 'story', 'tender', 'one', 'not', 'main', 'focus', 'movie.A', 'major', 'hero', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Blackwell', 'Carolina', 'Kava', 'who', 'was', 'Marie', 'primary', 'physician', 'learn', 'something', 'Marie', 'childhood', 'how', 'got', 'have', 'overwhelming', 'anxiety', 'psychosis', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'convent', 'orphanage', 'then', 'adopted', 'Bartellos', 'old-fashioned', 'Italian-American', 'family', 'terrorized', 'mother', 'would', 'lock', 'house', 'teach', 'lesson', 'when', 'was', '16', 'went', 'pounding', 'door', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'lack', 'anywhere', 'go', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'number', 'times', 'was', 'put', 'locked', 'ward', 'violent', 'patients', 'awhile', 'Dr.', 'Blackwell', 'rescued', 'worked', 'get', 'medications', 'adjusted', 'so', 'could', 'function.The', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'good', 'bit', 'detail', 'nature', 'therapy', 'steps', 'taken', 'gradually', 'move', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'parallel', 'much', 'own', 'experiences', 'psychiatric', 'world', 'end', 'critical', 'factor', 'people', 'willing', 'trust', 'give', 'opportunities', 'However', 'much', 'may', 'say', 'patient', 'do', 'work', 'people', 'willing', 'help', 'trust', 'love', 'listen', 'Awareness', 'fact', 'how', 'lucky', 'had', 'been', 'own', 'recovery', 'Marie', 'eventually', 'went', 'college', 'became', 'professional', 'final', 'scene', 'returning', 'hospital', 'give', 'lecture', 'patient', 'advocate']",Nobody's Child
