1220338,A2UTZ7HH4UKDZW,B001NLJ3TE,D. Nakao,"[0, 0]","This show is in the same mold as Barney Miller: politically incorrect, a lot of weird and off-the-wall characters, and it revolves around the criminal justice system in NYC. And like Barney Miller, it took place during a rather tumultuous time in NYC. And it brings back a lot of memories to this reviewer, many of them fond ones. My favorite episodes from Season 1 are ""Harry and the Rock Star"" in which Harry dates a punk rocker after they appear on a TV talk show, and ""Bull's Baby"" in which Bull's neighbor entrusts him with her baby and then runs away for a few days. My Season 2 faves are ""Pick a Number"" in which a meek gentleman with a winning lottery ticket entrusts Harry to give the winnings to a worthy recipient, and ""Nuts About Harry"" in which a group of patients from a mental institution are brought before Harry after they are arrested for disorderly conduct and for stiffing a cabbie.",5,Night Court Seasons 1 and 2,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,902,"['show', 'same', 'mold', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'lot', 'weird', 'off-the-wall', 'characters', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'NYC', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'took', 'place', 'rather', 'tumultuous', 'time', 'NYC', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'reviewer', 'many', 'fond', 'ones', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'are', 'Harry', 'Rock', 'Star', 'Harry', 'punk', 'rocker', 'appear', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'Bull', 'Baby', 'Bull', 'neighbor', 'baby', 'then', 'away', 'few', 'days', 'Season', '2', 'faves', 'are', 'Pick', 'Number', 'meek', 'gentleman', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'Harry', 'give', 'winnings', 'worthy', 'recipient', 'Nuts', 'Harry', 'group', 'patients', 'mental', 'institution', 'are', 'brought', 'Harry', 'are', 'arrested', 'disorderly', 'conduct', 'stiffing', 'cabbie']",Night Court: Seasons 1 & 2

1220340,AF56EQJXPK0S9,B001NLJ3TE,Mr. O,"[1, 1]","This was comedy at it's absolute best. There was no swearing, no offensive language and even the sexual innuendos of Dan Fielding was always in good taste and good adult humor. It proved what Red Skelton believed years ago; that you don't need a bunch of four letter words to really make people laugh. So much so that it is comedy the whole family can enjoy. I sent a copy to my youngest son who is 26 now, (it was with my eldest son that I used to watch this with and there is an 8 year difference between the two) and he had to admit to me that ""Okay Pop, Night Court is pretty darn funny""!Chalk another one up for the ol' man!If you like to laugh, if you like to laugh together with the kids and the whole family, if you like good clean laughter and just hanging out for a half an hour at a time with some good people who want nothing more than for you to enjoy yourself, buy Night Court.
