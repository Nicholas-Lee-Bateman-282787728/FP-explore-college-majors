763458,API5JLBRT6FIN,B0000AI428,KNSudha,"[40, 42]","For my now three year old, when Steve went away he was so sad that he didn't really take to Joe.  He had mostly watched re runs on noggin.  And for nearly a year now, he did not like to watch Blue's clues, because he know Steve has gone away or will leave.  But after watching this episode, he was so excited to see Joe as a baby, and Steve as a young boy -- exactly the age group that appeals to 3 to 4 year olds, and he watched with a 4 yr old friend, and both absolutely loved it.  And, to my relief, its brought back his love of blue.  And he is so thrilled to see those bonus episodes -- ""Steve is all grown up now!  He's a big boy!""  that it has brought the concept of growing home to him like nothing else.The cover episode is a lovely story line about how Blue puppy comes to join Steve.  We buy all of these for the bonus Steve episodes which we already own on VHS :-)  Wish they would just go ahead and put the episodes on the Main Menu, instead of one level of ""Bonus"" indirection.  Anyway, Joe or Steve, Blue's Clue's is so educational and appealing, its absolutely not to miss.  This one has the Blue's Big Holiday VHS episodes as bonus.",5,"very appealing stories, plus bonus episodes with steve",1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,1150,"['now', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'when', 'Steve', 'went', 'away', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'Joe', 'had', 'mostly', 'watched', 're', 'noggin', 'nearly', 'year', 'now', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'Blue', 'clues', 'know', 'Steve', 'gone', 'away', 'will', 'leave', 'watching', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'Joe', 'baby', 'Steve', 'young', 'boy', 'exactly', 'age', 'group', 'appeals', '3', '4', 'year', 'olds', 'watched', '4', 'yr', 'old', 'friend', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'relief', 'brought', 'back', 'love', 'blue', 'so', 'thrilled', 'see', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'Steve', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'big', 'boy', 'brought', 'concept', 'growing', 'home', 'nothing', 'else.The', 'cover', 'episode', 'lovely', 'story', 'line', 'how', 'Blue', 'puppy', 'join', 'Steve', 'buy', 'bonus', 'Steve', 'already', 'own', 'VHS', 'would', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'put', 'episodes', 'Main', 'Menu', 'instead', 'one', 'level', 'Bonus', 'indirection', 'Anyway', 'Joe', 'Steve', 'Blue', 'Clue', 'so', 'educational', 'appealing', 'absolutely', 'not', 'miss', 'one', 'Blue', 'Big', 'Holiday', 'VHS', 'bonus']",N/A

763460,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0000AI428,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","I guess we have more Blues Clues videos and DVDs than any other character. He's been a favorite of my son's since before he was one year old. Now he's almost 2 1/2 and has begun to develop more serious tastes. He'll actually watch many more programs geared towards older kids, and even adults, but he still likes his Blues Clues now and then.This holiday Blues is very special for a couple of reasons.  ""Blues first Holiday"" tells the tale of how Steve first met Blue.  The other surprise is that it even features Steve's brother Joe when Joe was just a baby.The second episode is ""Joe's Surprise Party""  has the whole gange getting ready for Joe's surprise birthday party while trying to keep it secret from Joe.
