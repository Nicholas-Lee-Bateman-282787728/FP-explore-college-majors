1121735,A3MFU0GVZUVH3K,B000ZBEOGA,"Betty L. Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[7, 9]","When rating a horror movie, I go by the chill factor (no pun intended) and the ""grip"" it keeps on me throughout the viewing.Furnace (Unrated)was creepily chilling, gripping me from the beginning: yellowed newspaper clippings against a dark prison background with shooting flames devouring everything in sight. The stories headlined a warden's daughter ""gone missing,"" an old prison closing under mysterious circumstances and something about an Indian burial ground. It was an eerie start to a thrilling, supernatural horror film.Furnace (Unrated)opens with a guard smashing his fingers while aiding in the re-opening of the walled-off section of the prison, then going home and doing something horrible, leaving his young wife devastated.Bad things are happening to so many of the prisoners that the detective played by actor Michael Pare opens an investigation to determine what's going on in order to stop the death and destruction.The main female lead is played by lovely, talented Jenny McShane who plays a prison psychiatrist. McShane and Pare are well cast in these roles.What happens when the detective calls on ""The Doc"" to help get to the bottom of the mystery? What is one of her aging patients hiding? He's an inmate named Simon and knows something about the warden and his daughter from long ago? But what? Is he the killer or is it something more sinister? Are supernatural forces at work? And what does the prison furnace have to do with the tragedies?One predictable outcome is that Pare and McShane's characters are attracted to each other, but the bedroom scene is not what you would expect. The evil finds them and causes one of the most frightening scenes in the movie. McShane's dramatic skills dominate this scene, which is my favorite scene in the entire movie. Realistic performance!A performance you'll have to see for yourself to find out what happens and learn the answers to the above questions.I highly recommend this movie--on the stipulation that you lock all your windows and doors before it commences. You might start jumping at your own shadow.In addition to McShane and Pare, Ja Rule puts in a surprisingly good performance as a troubled prisoner. But it's no surprise that veteran actor Tom Sizemore gives a great performance as the prison guard you love to hate. He has it ""in"" for our brave detective so causes more twists in this chilling horror.True horror buffs will not want to miss this one! Great graphics!ENDNOTE:The cover fits the movie, but I was disappointed that it had pictures of four male actors on front, but relegated Jenny McShane to the back; she was, after all, the lead actress.

1121737,A133S8CUIVRFKN,B000ZBEOGA,Chase von,"[0, 0]","I haven't reviewed many movies.  And just being honest here, I think there's more to consider when reviewing a movie than there is when reviewing a book.  Primarily because I think 'things' (And this could just be me),  heard and seen visually have more of an impact on people than things that they just read.  One movie I reviewed was 'specifically'  and only because the cursing in it offended me and I didn't agree with the PG-13 rating.(I'm no stranger to cursing), but when I don't want my children even in the room, that kind of spells it out for me.  And had I had known that by a more accurate rating, I wouldn't have started watching it, nor allowed them to begin watching it and then had to say, ""You can't watch this anymore!""  Forest Gump is another movie with some gruesome parts but I still agree with the PG-13 rating as it wasn't something I left the movie specifically remembering.That said, 'Furnace' isn't rated, it is a ""Horror/Suspense"" and over all I don't think I would mind if my 15 year old watched it when he was 13, though I wouldn't go lower than that age.  (Far as violence and weird he's probably seen worse in video games.  (There is a sex scene), but I think it's tastefully done, and I'm also one of those ""strange beings"" that think there are far worse things than sex.  (None of us would be here, were it not for that, and that's something I think most 13 year olds now days are aware of.  So I must say, ""Great Special Effects Alone... Does Not A Great Movie Make.""Now on to Furnace.  Which does have some great special effects that fit with the story line of the movie.  But in addition to that, I was pleasantly surprised to find that when you review it all the way around, it's solid there as well.  Meaning there is a story and it's an interesting and ""Quite Out There"" one.  And also there is some solid acting all the way around as well.  Creepy?  Yes.  Will it make you jump on a few occasions?  Yes!  But I don't think I'm going to be having any nightmare's either.  The most recognizable people in it are Michael Pare as the detective who has the typical burden one would expect a law enforcer to be bearing, Tom Sizemore who has a chip on his shoulder for the detective and who succeeds in making you not like him, and Danny Trejo because I remember him from many other films (Dust Till Dawn) being just one, and he's one actor that you always remember.  I don't know if this is Ja Rule's acting debut but if it is, he has done better than well.  And the 'Doc' ""Jenny McShane"" also puts in a very strong performance.  (I think if this was just horror with no substantial story to base it on, or special effects alone, this movie would be an abysmal failure).  But because you get to liking the detective, hating the guard, and liking the ""Doc"" when things start happening, you actually care what happens to them.I think some of the reviews here have already said pretty much perhaps what happens in this movie but I for one, am going to have to watch it again, as there is something said, at the very end, and in order to see if that is what was 'really' taking place, I would have to view it again and pay more attention.  (Although I thought I was paying attention the first time and my attention was held throughout).Definitely entertaining and definitely something that will make you think about ""things"" outside the normal realm, we have yet to fully understand. What is the most frightening of all, is it is said to be based on a true story.Your Chance to Hear The Last Panther Speak",5,A Solid Movie All Around!!!,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,3535,"['have', ""n't"", 'reviewed', 'many', 'movies', 'just', 'being', 'honest', 'here', 'think', 'more', 'consider', 'when', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'when', 'reviewing', 'book', 'Primarily', 'think', ""'things"", 'could', 'just', 'be', 'heard', 'seen', 'visually', 'have', 'more', 'impact', 'people', 'things', 'just', 'read', 'One', 'movie', 'reviewed', 'was', ""'specifically"", 'only', 'cursing', 'offended', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'PG-13', 'rating', ""'m"", 'stranger', 'cursing', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'children', 'even', 'room', 'kind', 'spells', 'out', 'had', 'had', 'known', 'more', 'accurate', 'rating', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'started', 'watching', 'allowed', 'begin', 'watching', 'then', 'had', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'anymore', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'movie', 'gruesome', 'parts', 'still', 'agree', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'left', 'movie', 'specifically', 'remembering.That', 'said', ""'Furnace"", ""n't"", 'rated', 'Horror/Suspense', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'mind', '15', 'year', 'old', 'watched', 'when', 'was', '13', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'lower', 'age', 'Far', 'violence', 'weird', 'probably', 'seen', 'worse', 'video', 'games', 'sex', 'scene', 'think', 'tastefully', 'done', ""'m"", 'also', 'one', 'strange', 'beings', 'think', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'things', 'sex', 'None', 'would', 'be', 'here', 'were', 'not', 'something', 'think', 'most', '13', 'year', 'olds', 'now', 'days', 'are', 'aware', 'must', 'say', 'Great', 'Special', 'Effects', 'Alone', 'Not', 'A', 'Great', 'Movie', 'Make', 'Now', 'Furnace', 'Which', 'have', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'fit', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'addition', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'when', 'review', 'way', 'solid', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Meaning', 'story', 'interesting', 'Quite', 'one', 'also', 'solid', 'acting', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'Creepy', 'Yes', 'Will', 'make', 'jump', 'few', 'occasions', 'Yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'having', 'nightmare', 'most', 'recognizable', 'people', 'are', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'detective', 'who', 'typical', 'burden', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'law', 'enforcer', 'be', 'bearing', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'who', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'detective', 'who', 'making', 'not', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'remember', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Dust', 'Till', 'Dawn', 'being', 'just', 'one', 'one', 'actor', 'always', 'remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'acting', 'debut', 'done', 'better', 'well', ""'Doc"", 'Jenny', 'McShane', 'also', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'horror', 'substantial', 'story', 'base', 'special', 'effects', 'alone', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'abysmal', 'failure', 'get', 'liking', 'detective', 'hating', 'guard', 'liking', 'Doc', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'actually', 'care', 'what', 'them.I', 'think', 'reviews', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'pretty', 'much', 'perhaps', 'what', 'movie', 'one', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'something', 'said', 'very', 'end', 'order', 'see', 'what', 'was', ""'really"", 'taking', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'view', 'again', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'thought', 'was', 'paying', 'attention', 'first', 'time', 'attention', 'was', 'held', '.Definitely', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'something', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'things', 'normal', 'realm', 'have', 'yet', 'fully', 'understand', 'What', 'most', 'frightening', 'said', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story.Your', 'Chance', 'Hear', 'Last', 'Panther', 'Speak']",Furnace

Overworked cop with a sad story, angry/crazy jailman, creepy looking baddies.I don't want to ruin anything, but I will say this.  Don't come in expecting a bunch of great CGI, it's rather basic, but not cheap like a Sci Fi Channel movie. Plotline is pretty decent, wasn't expecting the twist as to why the deaths were happening, why the little girl is there, and they didn't give it away too early like many do.  The three actual famous actors were pretty good, doing what they usually do.There's only one thing though that didn't make any sense.  This isn't really a spoiler as it's in the opening credits.  They show a bunch of news papers starting from I think 1611 to 19-something.

1121741,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000ZBEOGA,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","Awhile back, Japanese Horror or J-horror, was all the rage.  It kicked off withThe Ring, a movie that scared the daylights out of me, and spiraled downward from there.  By the timeThe Ring Twocame out, the tropes of evil little ghost girls with long black hair infecting your brain were pass&eacute;. This is partially because American audiences perceive ghosts as people, not concepts.  So the idea of getting ""infected"" by a ghost is foreign, and Ring Two made the mistake of turning its subject into a villain rather than a contagion. Once that happened, J-horror was doomed in the U.S.And thus we have Furnace, which is ashamed of its J-horror roots because it was released after Ring Two put the final nail in the coffin. Instead of being about creepy little girls it tries to convince the audience it's about a down on his luck convict (Ja Rule as Terrence Dufresne) in a haunted maximum-security prison. It isn't.Furnace is really about Detective Michael Turner (played by mumbled-mouthed Michael Pare who previously starred in such gems asKomodo vs. Cobra) and his relationship with prison psychologist Dr. Ashley Carter (Jenny McShane).  It's also about Frank Miller (played by the obviously high Tom Sizemore), a dirty prison guard who controls the prisoners through drug deals.  Finally, it's about the relationship between the former warden of Blackgate Prison and his daughter.There isn't one but two ghosts in this film, and that just gives you a sense of the disorganized mess that is Furnace. Dufresne is fighting Miller, Miller's fighting Turner, Turner has a romance with Carter, and the ghosts are fighting each other. The one plot line that should be front and center involves one of the cutest forensics examiners on film, Karen Bolding (the delicious Kelly Stables).  Although a romance between Bolding and Turner is hinted at throughout the film, we instead get the much less believable (and lukewarm) Turner/Carter dalliance that isn't nearly as rewarding.Eventually, all these threads collide in the ghostly furnace beneath the prison.  Promising characters - you know, the ones played by decent actors - suffer unsatisfying deaths off-screen.  Less interesting characters live.  Miller actually stumbles out of the film like a zombie. And the end pieces during the credits contradict everything we know about the ghosts.Furnace has its moments. Both ghosts are creepy manifestations of ghastly burn victims and their methods of killing their prey are interesting.  Unfortunately, the ghosts are all that's interesting.  Unless you count Danny Trejo, who is awesome in all things.Furnace went through a lot of rewrites and it shows.

The movie was entertaining enough to keep me interested...however when the credits rolled I was ultimately disappointed as in my opinion poor writing made the flick fall apart and squandered a good opportunity for a good film.",2,Furnace cools down pretty quickly,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,604,"['bought', 'film..and', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'love', 'Tom', 'Seizemore..and', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'simply', 'modern', 'cult', 'star', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'interesting', 'character', 'development', 'pretty', 'eerie', 'setting', 'horror', 'aspect', 'film', 'derivative', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'Ring', 'elm', 'street', 'series..it', 'try', 'put', 'own', 'signature', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'however', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'ultimately', 'disappointed', 'opinion', 'poor', 'writing', 'made', 'flick', 'fall', 'apart', 'squandered', 'good', 'opportunity', 'good', 'film']",Furnace

The story is solid, as is the acting.  There are a couple of holes, but it covers its' bases.Pare plays a homicide detective named Turner who, while investigating the apparent suicide of a guard from Blackgate Prison, stumbles onto a rash of suicides and unexplained deaths at the prison.  The administration wants to blame it on drugs, but the inmates know something worse is going on. The administration had a sealed section of the prison reopened after it had been closed for over fifty years.  The something inside that section is disturbed by the activity and starts hunting.
