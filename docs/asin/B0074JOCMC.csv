In theory I agree with him, in practice, this mini-series, which could have been great was lackluster due to flatly written characters and hackneyed situations.The narrative structure is interesting with each episode covering the same time period for different characters ranging from steerage to first class. The class conflicts that make the Titanic a legend are presented so superfically that they could have been written by a Marxist cartoonist writing propaganda for the retarded. The characters are all stereotypes that never get beyond a quick outline. Real life characters, such as Officer Lightoller, a genuine hero his entire life, are presented in a poor light in an attempt to give the characterizations ""depth"". The acting is solid, the production values pretty but it is all in all a disappointment, made more keen by the fact that a great drama about the Titanic that was an antidote to the romance and adventure of 1997's Titanic would have been welcomed by many viewers.

1526257,AGTECQ01OG8F7,B0074JOCMC,"Bob Bob Bob ""RJS""","[42, 59]","Amazed that people are giving 5 star reviews for something they haven't even seen, I've watched the first two of the four episodes and find the whole thing tedious and extremely disappointing. I have a passion for all things 'Titanic' and was really looking forward to this series, but it's more like a soap opera afloat than a dramatisation of the most famous maritime disaster. Although some of the effects are very good, part of the first episode appeared to be filmed in the living room of a Victorian house, rather than the first class lounge of the largest liner the world had seen at that time. Scant mention is made of the causes of the disaster, just a few throw away statements about the lack of lifeboats, use of iron instead of steel rivets, missing binoculars and a ""there's been some ice warnings"". Although it has been made out to be telling of the story without distractions, (no 'Rose and Jack), it's more 'Downton Afloat' a soap opera all at sea. If at all possible try to view it before buying the DVD, it may well be your sort of thing but for me it's a wasted opportunity to make a definitive drama. UPDATE- having now watched the 3rd episode, I can only say it has got even worse,  In fact I've now given up on it, if you have any knowledge about Titanic, or are any sort of fanatic on the subject I would advise you to give this rubbish a miss, Apart from the ships crew, none of the characters it follows ever actually existed and the causes of the disaster are passed over 'in the blink of an eye' it truly is just a soap opera on board ship.",1,Very disappointing,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,1567,"['Amazed', 'people', 'are', 'giving', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'four', 'episodes', 'find', 'whole', 'thing', 'tedious', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'have', 'passion', 'things', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'series', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'afloat', 'dramatisation', 'most', 'famous', 'maritime', 'disaster', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'part', 'first', 'episode', 'appeared', 'be', 'filmed', 'living', 'room', 'Victorian', 'house', 'rather', 'first', 'class', 'lounge', 'largest', 'liner', 'world', 'had', 'seen', 'time', 'Scant', 'mention', 'made', 'causes', 'disaster', 'just', 'few', 'throw', 'away', 'statements', 'lack', 'lifeboats', 'use', 'iron', 'instead', 'steel', 'rivets', 'missing', 'binoculars', 'been', 'ice', 'warnings', 'been', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'telling', 'story', 'distractions', ""'Rose"", 'Jack', 'more', ""'Downton"", 'Afloat', 'soap', 'opera', 'sea', 'possible', 'try', 'view', 'buying', 'DVD', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'sort', 'thing', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'make', 'definitive', 'drama', 'UPDATE-', 'having', 'now', 'watched', '3rd', 'episode', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'got', 'even', 'worse', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'now', 'given', 'up', 'have', 'knowledge', 'Titanic', 'are', 'sort', 'fanatic', 'subject', 'would', 'advise', 'give', 'rubbish', 'miss', 'Apart', 'ships', 'crew', 'none', 'characters', 'ever', 'actually', 'existed', 'causes', 'disaster', 'are', 'passed', 'blink', 'eye', 'truly', 'just', 'soap', 'opera', 'board', 'ship']",Titanic

1526259,AB34G6VKP28L,B0074JOCMC,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[5, 7]","Since I first fell in love with the stories surrounding the ill-fated ocean liner at age thirteen, I have read and watched anything I can get my hands on pertaining to the ship. For someone who knows nothing about Titanic, this miniseries by Julian Fellowes may prove illuminating if at times downright misleading, but it is certainly nothing to write home about.With the suffragist movement sweeping across England, Lord Manton (Linus Roache) has been having trouble keeping his daughter Georgiana (Perditia Weeks) in line. Her most recent escapade has landed her in the local lock-up, and out of desperation he decides that a change of scenery might do her some good. Enlisting the assistance of friend Bruce Ismay (James Wilby) to book Georgiana a first class cabin on the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, he hopes that a stint in New York will put her mind to better uses than feminism. Also on board, in second class, is his employee John Batley (Toby Jones) and his wife Muriel (Maria Doyle Kennedy). It doesn't take long for Muriel to clash with Lady Louisa (Geraldine Somerville) and let out secrets Lord Manton did not want made into public knowledge.Meanwhile, stewardess Annie (Jenna-Louise Coleman) is being wooed by an Italian last-minute steward Paelo (Glen Blackhall), who fears that once they land in America he may never see her again. The servants of the Grex family share a secret that could endanger them both, an anarchist has set his intentions on another man's wife in steerage, and Second Officer Charles Lightoller (Steven Waddington) must cope with a shuffle in position, as well as the challenges the night presents as it wears on.Trying to reproduce the tragedy on this topic scaled for television is not an enviable task since it has nowhere near the budget of the big-screen blockbuster. Other series and movies have managed to work around that, but unfortunately this vision is hampered by a rushed narrative that insists on a reset for the first three installments. Carrying the audience through events up to the sinking and then returning to tell a different story hinders us from emotional involvement with already-established characters, and greatly limits our scope, both for the real figures of the disaster and the ship itself. That none of the staterooms, the first class dining room, or even the deck resemble the real thing is less important than the fact that the entire production feels claustrophobic. The rooms are so small, and our interludes kept to so few figures, that we never really get to see what an incredible achievement Titanic truly was, much less how many people were on board. The sinking scenes are suitably crowded, but not the dining rooms. Fellowes' script also makes some truly appalling mistakes, ranging from mixed church sessions on board ship to the behavior and placement of individual figures during the sinking.Various miniature love stories unfold and there are times we are drawn into the emotions of the moment, but alas, we get to know no one all that well, so when their fate transpires we feel as if we should have felt more than we did. Then too, the lack of a memorable score makes the emotions in many important scenes fall flat. Characters are introduced and then nothing is done with them. Thomas Andrews simply disappears. One officer is manning the wrong boat. The Duff-Gordons are slandered.Television has needed a decent miniseries on this topic for a long time. But this isn't it. It founders where it should glide, thanks mostly to the problematic structure. It would work better as one cohesive narrative, with events unfolding simultaneously leading up to the sinking and less of a scattered focus. It needed to be built around one or two characters, not a dozen. But alas, instead we are stuck with a miniseries aspiring to be much more than it actually is.",3,A Sinking Feeling,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,3849,"['first', 'fell', 'love', 'stories', 'surrounding', 'ill-fated', 'ocean', 'liner', 'age', 'thirteen', 'have', 'read', 'watched', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'pertaining', 'ship', 'someone', 'who', 'nothing', 'Titanic', 'miniseries', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'may', 'prove', 'illuminating', 'times', 'downright', 'misleading', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'suffragist', 'movement', 'sweeping', 'England', 'Lord', 'Manton', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'been', 'having', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'daughter', 'Georgiana', 'Perditia', 'Weeks', 'line', 'most', 'recent', 'escapade', 'landed', 'local', 'lock-up', 'desperation', 'change', 'scenery', 'might', 'do', 'good', 'Enlisting', 'assistance', 'friend', 'Bruce', 'Ismay', 'James', 'Wilby', 'book', 'Georgiana', 'first', 'class', 'cabin', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'RMS', 'Titanic', 'stint', 'New', 'York', 'will', 'put', 'mind', 'better', 'uses', 'feminism', 'Also', 'board', 'second', 'class', 'employee', 'John', 'Batley', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'wife', 'Muriel', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Muriel', 'clash', 'Lady', 'Louisa', 'Geraldine', 'Somerville', 'let', 'out', 'secrets', 'Lord', 'Manton', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'made', 'public', 'knowledge.Meanwhile', 'stewardess', 'Annie', 'Jenna-Louise', 'Coleman', 'being', 'wooed', 'Italian', 'last-minute', 'steward', 'Paelo', 'Glen', 'Blackhall', 'who', 'once', 'land', 'America', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'servants', 'Grex', 'family', 'share', 'secret', 'could', 'endanger', 'anarchist', 'set', 'intentions', 'man', 'wife', 'steerage', 'Second', 'Officer', 'Charles', 'Lightoller', 'Steven', 'Waddington', 'must', 'cope', 'shuffle', 'position', 'as', 'well', 'challenges', 'night', 'on.Trying', 'reproduce', 'tragedy', 'topic', 'scaled', 'television', 'not', 'enviable', 'task', 'nowhere', 'budget', 'big-screen', 'blockbuster', 'Other', 'series', 'movies', 'have', 'managed', 'work', 'around', 'unfortunately', 'vision', 'hampered', 'rushed', 'narrative', 'reset', 'first', 'three', 'installments', 'Carrying', 'audience', 'events', 'up', 'sinking', 'then', 'returning', 'tell', 'different', 'story', 'hinders', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'already-established', 'characters', 'greatly', 'scope', 'real', 'figures', 'disaster', 'ship', 'none', 'staterooms', 'first', 'class', 'dining', 'room', 'even', 'deck', 'resemble', 'real', 'thing', 'less', 'important', 'fact', 'entire', 'production', 'feels', 'claustrophobic', 'rooms', 'are', 'so', 'small', 'interludes', 'kept', 'so', 'few', 'figures', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'incredible', 'achievement', 'Titanic', 'truly', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'board', 'sinking', 'scenes', 'are', 'suitably', 'crowded', 'not', 'dining', 'rooms', 'Fellowes', 'script', 'also', 'truly', 'appalling', 'mistakes', 'ranging', 'mixed', 'church', 'sessions', 'board', 'ship', 'behavior', 'placement', 'individual', 'figures', 'sinking.Various', 'miniature', 'love', 'stories', 'unfold', 'are', 'times', 'are', 'drawn', 'emotions', 'moment', 'alas', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'well', 'so', 'when', 'fate', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'felt', 'more', 'did', 'Then', 'too', 'lack', 'memorable', 'score', 'emotions', 'many', 'important', 'scenes', 'fall', 'flat', 'Characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'nothing', 'done', 'Thomas', 'Andrews', 'simply', 'One', 'officer', 'manning', 'wrong', 'boat', 'Duff-Gordons', 'are', 'slandered.Television', 'needed', 'decent', 'miniseries', 'topic', 'long', 'time', ""n't"", 'where', 'should', 'glide', 'thanks', 'mostly', 'problematic', 'structure', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'one', 'cohesive', 'narrative', 'events', 'unfolding', 'simultaneously', 'leading', 'up', 'sinking', 'less', 'scattered', 'focus', 'needed', 'be', 'built', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'not', 'dozen', 'alas', 'instead', 'are', 'stuck', 'miniseries', 'aspiring', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'actually']",Titanic
1526260,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B0074JOCMC,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[12, 16]","I watched this on ABC and recorded it without the commercials and watched it again. I had high hopes for this mini-series but I really felt it didn't work for several reasons which had little to do with production values or poor casting. The casting was really quite good and for a television production which didn't have a billion dollar budget and mega special effects, it was really quite well done and rather impressive.My problem with this production gravitated around issues such as continuity, character development, and something that is virtually insurmountable --- the legend of the Titanic itself.I think it is difficult to play around with anything that has its basis in fact because too much has been written about the Titanic. While the subject is being overworked right now due to the centennial of the disaster, the event has been in the public eye for decades and got a new life when the wreckage was located and explored 26 years ago. Traveling Titanic shows, books, documentaries, and James Cameron's films have stoked public interest and has provided at the very least a common perception of what occured on April 14-15, 1912.This production attempts to mimic the formula that has made Downton Abbey a phenomena. Julian Fellowes has written a screenplay that mixes real people and events with fictional characters that represent all classes of people present on the ship and creates multiple personal storylines for his ficticious characters. The problem I had with this is a mini series of less than four hours doesn't allow the viewer to get invested in the characters and their stories as well as an epic disaster. This production also hops all over the Titanic roadmap, bouncing between multiple narratives and the actual sinking. I even think some scenes (or at least parts of scenes) are reused throughout the story. I found myself flipping between flooding corridors and lifeboats being loaded and scenes that had to have occurred earlier. It tends to be somewhat confusing, though I concede that when I viewed it a second time without commercials it did make more sense.There were some areas where this story managed to remain true to the original event. There was the feistyness of Mrs. Margaret Brown, the model/actress Dorothy Gibson flightiness, the wealthy Philadelphia Wideners private dinner on the night of the sinking, Benjamin Guggenheim was traveling with his mistress, officers Murdoch and Lightoller were accurately portrayed as they were involved loading the lifeboats. All of this added a sense of authenticity to this production which is focused on a fictional study of a class system. The Titanic is an excellent metaphor for the class system that was in place at the time and ultimately resulted in the overwhelming number of third class passengers that died. However,  I really didn't get the way Captain Smith was portrayed. He came off as a pompous incompetent and seemed to be jockeying for the mantle of ultimate villain with J. Bruce Ismay. This is obviously a dramatic conceit to place blame on someone for the disaster, but I am not sure it worked or was even necessary. Titanic sank because there was a convergence of many isolated events/flaws that came together to create the ultimate disaster. Really isn't that dramatic enough?  Something that wasn't supposed to happen did.In retrospect, I think the thing that sunk this production was the lack of time to develop the characters properly, the choppy editing which really lost me for the most part, and the endless commercial breaks. It was really difficult to feel invested in the fictional characters. The only plot that was simple enough to work was a romance between a maid and an Italian waiter. It was simple and direct so it worked.The dvd release should be better ---- no commercials, but I think more would have to be done to pull this story together. What works so well with Downton Abbey doesn't seem to work in this instance. Time wasn't on the Titanic's side and the same is true regarding this screenplay.

I'm guessing she is more popular in Britain.  Thisis probably a break out role for most to get to know her in the USA, if they haven't already.  I know shehas been in some television shows that you can watch here, but it is the first that I've heard of her.I would get the dvd just for her character.  She is a realist in the movie andher character, along with her personality, is strong.  Not so much to be a turnoff however.  She shows emotion as well.You sympathize with her.  Not to put down anyone else.  All the characters in themovie were excellent and well acted.  I also like the character portrayed by Sophie Winkleman whois Dorothy Gibson in the movie.  I won't get into all the characters in the movie, but they wereall great.  I can't name a flaw in anything.  They all had different and specific personalties for thiswell made series for television.Don't expect this to be as grand as the Titanic movie made in 1997 or the older versions madefor the movie theater.  It wasn't meant to be.  It is more of a drama on board the ship.  Althoughit could have been made longer for it to be better, you will see enough of the movie to feel forthe characters involved.  Mostly fictional intermingled with the real persons that were on the shipat the time.  You get a sense that it could have happened in that way.This is a made for television series on a budget.  So don't expect to see every detail.  It is as accurateas can be for a television series.The dvd will explain a lot and will show what was missedin the cut up for commercials during the broadcast in America, whichis unfortunate.Some might get turned off by some of the politics in the movie butthere are emotional parts as well.  Overall, a very good movie.  Well worth the buyto see what was missing in the television version and to get the extras on the dvd as well.Make sure to watch it up to the end credits to get a little explanation at the endof the movie about what happened afterward in real life and the changes that weremade to liners after this tragedy.",5,Excellent movie.,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,2156,"['Jenna', 'Louise', 'Coleman', 'Annie', 'Desmond', 'great', 'role.It', 'first', 'movie', 'television', 'show', 'have', 'seen', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'more', 'popular', 'Britain', 'Thisis', 'probably', 'break', 'out', 'role', 'most', 'get', 'know', 'USA', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'shehas', 'been', 'television', 'can', 'watch', 'here', 'first', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'her.I', 'would', 'get', 'dvd', 'just', 'character', 'realist', 'movie', 'andher', 'character', 'personality', 'strong', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'turnoff', 'however', 'emotion', 'well.You', 'sympathize', 'Not', 'put', 'down', 'anyone', 'else', 'characters', 'themovie', 'were', 'excellent', 'well', 'acted', 'also', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Sophie', 'Winkleman', 'Dorothy', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'characters', 'movie', 'wereall', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'name', 'flaw', 'anything', 'had', 'different', 'specific', 'personalties', 'thiswell', 'made', 'series', 'television.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'as', 'grand', 'Titanic', 'movie', 'made', '1997', 'older', 'versions', 'madefor', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'more', 'drama', 'board', 'ship', 'Althoughit', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'longer', 'be', 'better', 'will', 'see', 'enough', 'movie', 'feel', 'forthe', 'characters', 'involved', 'Mostly', 'fictional', 'intermingled', 'real', 'persons', 'were', 'shipat', 'time', 'get', 'sense', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'way.This', 'made', 'television', 'series', 'budget', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'detail', 'accurateas', 'can', 'be', 'television', 'series.The', 'dvd', 'will', 'explain', 'lot', 'will', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'missedin', 'cut', 'up', 'commercials', 'broadcast', 'America', 'unfortunate.Some', 'might', 'get', 'turned', 'off', 'politics', 'movie', 'are', 'emotional', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Well', 'buyto', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'television', 'version', 'get', 'extras', 'dvd', 'well.Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'up', 'end', 'get', 'little', 'explanation', 'endof', 'movie', 'what', 'happened', 'afterward', 'real', 'life', 'changes', 'weremade', 'liners', 'tragedy']",Titanic

This is a four part mini-series that offers a fairly unique take on the voyage. The first three episodes offers three different 'main focus' perspective (passengers, crew, stowaways) and each of those episodes jumps back to the start of trip and ends as the ship is being evacuated. The four episode deals with more of the immediate aftermath for those that survived in terms of looking for other survivors while waiting for rescue and mourning for those who did not make it.The overall production is pretty ambitious for it's aims and there's enough there in terms of the sets to forget that this was a TV production. Compared to the James Cameron mess that hit theaters in 1996, the miniseries gives more to the actual feeling of the trip without the sappiness and bad acting.I do recommend renting the series, but take my advice watch the episodes on four consecutive days as opposed to one sitting.

1526263,AU10YGO10MUCA,B0074JOCMC,Gary Lee,"[3, 4]","It is no small feat to make the sinking of the Titanic a bore.  Writer Julian Fellowes has managed it.  Our imaginations are never drawn into the enduring fascination of this well-worn story as it receives yet another retelling.  Pity.  One would have thought that with Fellowes at the helm--he being a preeminent expert on all things Edwardian, of which the Titanic was the epitome--that this production would have been unforgettable.He fills the ship with fictional characters, and dull ones at that.  Who needs 'em?  The spell of the Titanic endures after a century because of the heady mix of real-life travelers on board who were suddenly thrown into life-and-death circumstances that we all, with a shudder, can imagine ourselves confronting.  No fiction writer has ever been able to improve on what actually happened that night, and the people it happened to (and I include James Cameron).  The acting is good, but I just didn't care about the invented characters and their cliched problems that Fellowes has concocted.But far more fatal (pun intended) to the drama is that fact that the spectacle of the sinking itself is continually interrupted with shifting time frames, giving no sense of the growing desperation of the passengers and crew.  With this fragmented approach to juggling the characters' stories, the suspense never builds.  We all know the outcome.  The intrigue lies in watching individuals on board grasp what has happened, as they face the dawning realization that the seemingly invincible Titanic is in fact sinking, and soon.  Fellowes' structure, jumping about in the chronology of the story, totally disrupts and dissipates this spellbinding sense of unfolding tragedy.  The allure of the Titanic's tale will always be in its breathless, ""You are there"" retelling, not in a staid GRAND HOTEL-style history lesson.Some of the special effects are worth a look.  The viewer gets a sense of how the luxury liner that sank with mind-boggling gymnastics in the middle of a clear night on a placid sea must have looked at points in her death throes.  But probably only Titanic buffs will find it worth enduring the rest of the dreck.I weary of yet again seeing the Titanic saga portrayed as a sudsy episode of class warfare.  That overplayed aspect of the calamity diverts viewers from far more elemental truths about the human condition that the story contains--truths that I suppose are referenced in two other words often used to summarize the event:  tragedy and fate--which compel more interest than privilege and snobbery.  Out of tragedy and fate, Ancient Greek playwrights wrought terror and catharsis, which they considered the essence of drama.  If ever there was a story tailor-made to evoke terror and catharsis, it is surely the Titanic.  They form the keys to the epic's enduring fascination.  By depicting the whole affair as basically a colossal inconvenience for a lot of self-centered people at sea, Fellowes misses the boat.",1,A Night to Forget,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,2967,"['small', 'feat', 'make', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'bore', 'Writer', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'managed', 'imaginations', 'are', 'never', 'drawn', 'enduring', 'fascination', 'well-worn', 'story', 'yet', 'retelling', 'Pity', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Fellowes', 'helm', 'being', 'preeminent', 'expert', 'things', 'Edwardian', 'Titanic', 'was', 'epitome', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unforgettable.He', 'ship', 'fictional', 'characters', 'dull', 'ones', 'Who', 'spell', 'Titanic', 'endures', 'century', 'heady', 'mix', 'real-life', 'travelers', 'board', 'who', 'were', 'suddenly', 'thrown', 'life-and-death', 'circumstances', 'shudder', 'can', 'imagine', 'confronting', 'fiction', 'writer', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'improve', 'actually', 'happened', 'night', 'people', 'happened', 'include', 'James', 'Cameron', 'acting', 'good', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'invented', 'characters', 'cliched', 'problems', 'Fellowes', 'concocted.But', 'far', 'more', 'fatal', 'pun', 'intended', 'drama', 'fact', 'spectacle', 'sinking', 'continually', 'interrupted', 'shifting', 'time', 'frames', 'giving', 'sense', 'growing', 'desperation', 'passengers', 'crew', 'fragmented', 'approach', 'juggling', 'characters', 'stories', 'suspense', 'never', 'builds', 'know', 'outcome', 'intrigue', 'watching', 'individuals', 'board', 'grasp', 'what', 'happened', 'face', 'dawning', 'realization', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'Titanic', 'fact', 'sinking', 'soon', 'Fellowes', 'structure', 'jumping', 'chronology', 'story', 'totally', 'disrupts', 'spellbinding', 'sense', 'unfolding', 'tragedy', 'allure', 'Titanic', 'tale', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'breathless', 'are', 'there', 'retelling', 'not', 'staid', 'GRAND', 'HOTEL-style', 'history', 'lesson.Some', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'look', 'viewer', 'sense', 'how', 'luxury', 'liner', 'sank', 'mind-boggling', 'gymnastics', 'middle', 'clear', 'night', 'placid', 'sea', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'points', 'death', 'throes', 'probably', 'only', 'Titanic', 'buffs', 'will', 'find', 'worth', 'enduring', 'rest', 'dreck.I', 'weary', 'yet', 'again', 'seeing', 'Titanic', 'saga', 'portrayed', 'sudsy', 'episode', 'class', 'warfare', 'overplayed', 'aspect', 'calamity', 'viewers', 'far', 'more', 'elemental', 'truths', 'human', 'condition', 'story', 'contains', 'suppose', 'are', 'referenced', 'two', 'other', 'words', 'often', 'used', 'summarize', 'event', 'tragedy', 'fate', 'compel', 'more', 'interest', 'privilege', 'snobbery', 'tragedy', 'fate', 'Ancient', 'Greek', 'playwrights', 'wrought', 'terror', 'catharsis', 'considered', 'essence', 'drama', 'ever', 'was', 'story', 'tailor-made', 'evoke', 'terror', 'catharsis', 'surely', 'Titanic', 'form', 'keys', 'epic', 'enduring', 'fascination', 'depicting', 'whole', 'affair', 'basically', 'colossal', 'inconvenience', 'lot', 'self-centered', 'people', 'sea', 'Fellowes', 'boat']",Titanic

1526265,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0074JOCMC,Grady Harp,"[22, 29]","The DVD hasn't been released here yet but the 'mini-series' is now over.  It is difficult to call this amalgamation of snippets about an historic tragedy a miniseries because it was spread out so unevenly (3 hours on first night, one hour on second night) and we are now informed that the film is a total of 184 minutes which means that the fourth hour was completely filled with the most distracting and disrupting of commercials.  Why this new version of TITANIC wasn't place on cable television where it could have been enjoyed on one uninterrupted three hour showing is beyond understanding.  Perhaps when the DVD is released and there are no loud and ugly commercials every 5 minutes the story will hold together.Julian Fellowes, so respected for his writing of such series as Downton Abbey, etc. seems to have the urge to tell the story of the event through quick snippets of personal stories among the passengers - a commendable idea, but when the tiny tales are buried in the almost immediate collision with the iceberg and the attempt to flesh out the story by making it about how tragedy affects people's relationships come as little disconnected pop-ups, it is difficult to care about anybody, much less get to know them well enough to remember them at picture's end. Granted there are some moments before the ship is finished that emphasize the fact that the unsinkable Titanic was rushed to completion before it was safely ready, and those flashbacks to offer some interesting moments.But basically the story is the same as all the other TITANIC movies - a study about class distinction not only among the peerage of Brits but also the differentiation among first, second and third (steerage) classes - with a hefty dollop of snubbing the crass American passengers. Jon Jones directs this amalgamation of ideas.  There are some brief but tasty moments for actors such as Glen Blackhall (a memorable Paolo) and Antonio Magro (Paolo's brother Mario), Peter McDonald, Steven Waddington, Ruth Bradley Linus Roache and Geraldine Somerville as the Mantons, Toby Jones and Maria Doyle Kennedy, Celia Emrie, James Wilby and Dragos Bucur (the stowaway Russian).  The rest of the cast is so little used that they all but disappear.The film was apparently shot on digital video.

1526266,A1HD5KASZ7F36S,B0074JOCMC,History Man,"[3, 5]","I finally slogged through all 4 hours (3 without commercials) of Julian Fellowes ""Titanic"" mini series. It's probably one of the worst Titanic films I've ever seen. The episodic nature of the four separate hour-long chapters (which is how it was shown in England) included multiple replays of several scenes without adding to the story, and fatally detracting from the flow of the action. The Titanic story is driven by suspense as much as tragedy. It works because the viewer (or reader) gets caught up in the sudden shift from complacency aboard ship, to the shock of realizing that your ""unskinkable"" ship is going down, there aren't enough boats, and you're probably going to die. The buildup to that climax is essential to the story. Instead, you have the story start and stop four times in this production, killing any sense of suspense.The Titanic story is full of amazing people and incidents, without having to invent fanciful ones, which this series does to a far greater degree than other Titanic fictionalizations. It even mixes fictional characters with real ones, creating fake ""relationships.""  An hour or so into this and my eyes were already glazing over from all the soap.The efforts to use the ship as a microcosm for the British class system are clumsy and heavy handed. Most of the first class passangers are a petty, shallow, dislikable lot who hardly scare up much sympathy from viewers when their fate is known. Viewers are more likely to think ""who cares?"" if so-and-so drowns? Fellowes explores this area far more effectively in ""Downton Abbey"" than he does here. Most of the characters are cardboard cutouts, despite having 3 hours to flesh them out.ABC-TV could not have done a more horrid job in its telecast of this series. Why the network chose to air 3 hours one night and only 1 hour the second night is really puzzling. By some odd front-office reasoning, the film was not shown in widescreen/letterbox format on the ABC stations, but was letterboxed on its HD channel! What sense does that make (or am I asking a dumb question here)? Commercial breaks were countless and occurred at an average rate of every 7 minutes!!! How can you maintain any sort of story momentum with constant disruptions like that?

One might say to give it a chance and see the whole series. I won't waste my time. After only the first hour of so, I turned away to something else. I admit that I was spouled with the movie. James Cameron poured so much money and beauty into his work. The sets were small and cheap. As for the acting, as my title states, it was a soap opera on the sea and I found that I did not care if they went down with the ship. I had bookmarked the DVD set to buy when it came out. I will save the money and now remove it from my list. Too bad, I had high hopes. The best words to describe this Titanic is; stink, stank, stunk, sunk.  James EllisonThe real story of the Titanic then, is it sunk at the dock. It was a clear night and the ocean was calm but it stunk like rotten sea weed. It is hard to determine which scene was the worst. Was it the scene where some of the male servants were tossing a woman's prized book in the air? Was it the scene where Mommy reminded her daughter it was late when she was out on the deck with a prospective beau? Was it the scene in the dining room when the scarlet woman was trying to sit at the dinner table with all the other married elite? What really sunk the Titanic?  Was it the script?  Was it the actors? Was it the director? Perhaps, the actors who had a really stinking, sinking, script really could not put their hearts into it.

I don't expect a special effects extravaganza or even lavish set decoration.  And it's a good thing because you'll get none of that with this version of Titanic.  That being said, a good story with lots of personal involving drama can overcome budgetary production problems.But unfortunately the movie has terrible editing and worse storytelling. I didn't mind so much that most of the storytelling was fictional.  But you never really have a chance to get involved with the lives of the characters because the movie was so hyper-schizophrenic that it was almost impossible to follow the multiple story lines. I couldn't tell who was doing what or with whom for most of the running time.One moment the ship is sinking, and the next moment we're back before the ship was launched being told a story of how we got here.  One moment the ship is hitting the iceberg, the next moment we're back on dry land again telling another story about another one of the characters.  One moment an Italian waiter is drowning, the next moment we're back on shore.  I'm not sure but by the time the movie was over, I think it rammed the iceberg at least three times, possibly more.  I lost count.  No wonder it sank.At least for me, the dialogue was often so muffled it became necessary for me to turn on the closed captions but that may have been a local broadcast problem.  There were a few decent performances and I especially enjoyed Jenna-Louise Coleman as perky maid Annie Desmond, but whatever any of the actors bring to the film is lost in a haze of herky jerky editing and often incoherent dialog.

There has never been anything to touch the emotion of that movie.  I never cared for the Cameron version except for the parts about discovering the Titanic.  I thought Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio were both miscast.  This 4 part TV version is very well done.  It takes a bit of getting used to when each episode starts back at the beginning and tells a story of a different set of characters with all episodes ending when the ship is sinking.  Only the 4th episode shows the actual sinking and lets you know who survives and who dies.  The acting is excellent, the script well written.  One huge error in the script is the man on the bridge saying ""Iceberg right ahead"".  They would never have done that as right indicates to the right.  ""Dead ahead"" is the correct phrase.  And, in every other thing I've seen or read it was Mr. Ismay who  insisted on the speed while in this version it is the captain who hasn't the sense God gave a goat and with all his years of experience should certainly have known better.  It is, as are all Titanic movies, a study of the class distinctions present during that time, that some people thought that they were just better than others,  and the pride and arrogance that made them think they could actually build a ship that could not be sunk.

1526274,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0074JOCMC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","I was quite excited when I heard that Julian Fellowes had signed on to write a new miniseries exploring the legendary Titanic tragedy. Fellowes is the reigning champion of upstairs/downstairs drama as evidenced by his Oscar winning screenplay for Altman's ""Gosford Park"" and his wildly successful production of ""Downton Abbey."" While that upscale soap opera is currently all-the-rage, it seemed a prime opportunity for Fellowes to branch out. Without a doubt, the class divisions, struggles and tensions aboard the Titanic certainly appeared to match his previous themes. And yet, while the idea seemed like an easy home run, ""Titanic"" (for all its elegance) is lacking in character drama that makes one actually care. The passengers on this ill-fated voyage are only superficially presented and their back stories are largely uninspired or entirely predictable. While there are still some good elements to ""Titanic,"" therefore, I never felt the time investment in watching the four part miniseries paid off in any appreciable way.The shortcomings of this particular trip rests almost squarely on the unimaginative screenplay. While I liked the idea of the overlapping structure of the show (each part presents different characters during the same pivotal time frame), it was an interesting narrative device that really didn't amount to much. The huge cast is impressive, but the characters lack dimension. A few stand-outs include Linus Roache (perhaps my favorite character, seen only sporadically after the first episode) as a progressive Earl, Toby Jones (always reliable) as a second class passenger dealing with a disappointed wife (The Tudor's Maria Doyle Kennedy in the series' most thankless role), and Glen Blackhall as an Italian immigrant working on the ship. But these and many more great actors are given an array of lackluster cliche's to serve up.Plotlines include undying new love in the upper class, undying new love in the lower decks (two characters spend about 30 minutes of real time together before committing to a future), a married woman with an unexplored attraction to an enigmatic stranger, and all the class snobbery that one might expect. A few of the story threads showed signs of life but never get developed beyond the most perfunctory way. And if you're just waiting for the climatic sinking sequence, it lacks any type of visual impact. In the end, it's all about who will live and who will die. And as the show drew to its conclusion, I realized I didn't really care much one way or another. Truly a disappointment!

1526275,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B0074JOCMC,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[4, 5]","I found this film to be a very different kind of Titanic movie. While I will not say that I liked this film as much as James Cameron's ""Titanic,"" I do have to say that I liked it tremendously and found it to be a totally different experience altogether.This film is all about the people! If I had to break this down I'd say this film is 80% about the people and characters that made up the gilded age and 20% about the historical facts and events that were the Titanic tragedy itself. That said, it in no way deterred me from enjoying the film. I found it fascinating engaging, interesting, and all around fantastic!This Titanic film is very much a ensemble film. I mean seriously the cast is enormous.  One downside of the film is that during the initial hour of the film it can be a bit difficult to keep track of who is who and who works for who and so on.  That said the film focuses on all three classes.The Earl of Manton is traveling with his wife and daughter in 1st Class. In the first hour of the film we get to see their experience on the ship and their various interactions with both historical and fictional characters aboard the Titanic. Here in this hour of the film this rendition of the Titanic shines. We are able to get more of the stories of Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress Madame Aubar, Jack Thayer, John Jacob Astor, Dorothy Gibson, and Harry Elkins Widener.  The character of Lady Manton is initially unlikeable as she exudes the snobbery that was that particular time period. This is especially clear in her constantly bringing class in to just about every scene that she is in. Lady Manton's husband however is portrayed in a much more self aware and heroic light.The film also delves into a fairly ignored group on the Titanic and that is the first class servants and their various interactions with their employers and each other. I found the story between the Manton's servants to be quite moving and yet beautifully subtle.  On that same token the film also focuses on another group of people often ignored by Titanic films, White Star Line employees who were not seamen. The film does this through the experiences of first class server Paolo Sandrini, Italian stoker Mario Sandrini, and 2nd class Stewardess Annie Desmond. Through their stories, the audience is given a glimpse as to what it would have been like to work on the Titanic. Paolo is a romantic dreamer and Annie is very much a practical pleasant person who doesn't believe in envy. These two have a beautiful love story that is probably the strongest in the series.John Batley and his wife Muriel give us the second class point of view, another group often ignored in most Titanic films. Batley is a employee of the Earl of Manton and very much a unassertive person and his wife Muriel more than makes up for this. She comes off as a very angry woman whose terribly unhappy with her position in life and detests the modern class structure.In Steerage, the film portrays the Maloney family who are moving from Ireland to New York to escape the religious persecution they were exposed to as Catholics in Ireland (at least that's what I gathered). Jim is in charge of the Titanic's electrical wiring and is given free passage for his wife Mary and their children (I think they had 4 maybe 5). To be very honest I found their story to be the weakest and most convoluted by ""soapiness."" Their story straightforward was powerful enough, but it gets muddied by Mary's wandering eye to another third class passenger, Peter. Peter is not just any normal passenger, he is lifted right out of history. Peter is ""Peter The Painter."" A historical figure lifted right out of the headlines of the time (definitely a bit of a unnecessary stretch).So the movie itself I found to be quite effective and beautiful. Is it historically accurate? Definitely not 100%, but what Titanic movie is? Did Harry Elkins Widener actually have a romance with a woman aboard the Titanic? Who knows for certain, but it's definitely not historically documented. That said, Widener's romance with Georgiana was entertaining and emotionally engaging and also gave the writer the opportunity to display some facets of what is known about Widener's personality. After seeing the film, I researched him and actually found him to be a very interesting character in history during both his life and after his death.Were Steerage passengers barricaded down below?  Quite frankly, no one knows for certain one way or the other and depending on what you read or see you get a different point of view.  The fact is we do not know what every single person was doing on that ship 24/7, so taking some degree of artistic liberty when making a MOVIE and I stress the word again...A MOVIE...is not the worst thing ever. Pretty much every Titanic  film, even the much beloved film, ""A Night To Remember,"" had too.The sinking of the ship is portrayed beautifully. We get to see the sinking in a manner that I have yet to see prior and that's the view of the ship's final moments from the perspective of someone in the water.  It's effective and looked quite realistic.The Blu-Ray and DVD  both have beautiful picture quiality and the special features are interesting. The documentary focuses mostly on the Titanic's sister ship Britannic, its sinking, and dives to the wreck.So I will say this, if you're a Titanic fan and you can enjoy the movie for the characters and not let every little historical inaccuracy drive you nuts (and I'm not saying that there are a ton because there's not) then get this movie and sit down and enjoy it! Fans of the Cameron film will simply find many more enjoyable perspectives to a story that they already know.",5,A Wonderful Titanic film that focuses on People!,1336176000,"05 5,

1526277,A1NX50T5CBEZ1G,B0074JOCMC,Minutemarch,"[4, 6]","So I was curious about this.  Never watched Downton Abbey (maybe I'm the only one?) but I knew it had a good rep so I went into this expecting it to be pretty decent.  I get the feeling it was going for historical accuracy, a snapshot of Edwardian society that just happened to be compressed into a doomed ship.  In the end I think it said more about the writers than the people on the Titanic.What I liked:I actually thought the approach was bold. I didn't warm to the characters because if it but I admire the non-misty eyed approach. Not everyone was the Titanic was likeable, after all, and not just the obvious villains would have grated against our modern sensibilities.  There was a lot of snobbery, class lines were rarely crossed and fear of the masses drove the whole thing along, sending many to their doom for reasons that seem horrifying to us.  I also thought it production looked pretty good considering its TV budget.  A few of the characters were likeable and Toby Jones is always watchable.What I didn't like:Maybe it went too hard for the realism or maybe it was OTT, slipping into caricature, but it was very hard to care about the fates of many of the people depicted and, well, the thing about the Titanic is it was a loss.  When you have a cluster of nasty people you mostly want to slap it's hard to see their loss as a tragedy.  Having the story hang off such characters was a bold move but I am not sure it paid off.The non-linear story telling didn't bother me. The fact it ended where it did didn't bother me, I just found it utterly lacking in any emotional impact aside from a desire to smack most of the people in First Class (and a number of crew).I didn't like the demonisation of Captain Smith either.  It was an inaccurate portrayal based on all accounts I've read on the man and was utterly unnecessary.  I am not a fan of being controversial for the sake of being controversial. I know it's not that well respected but I was far more moved by the James Cameron effort, imperfect though it was.The red card for me, though, came as the great ship went down.  People were falling, jumping, into the ice water.  Jumping to their deaths and I was... appalled to hear a very distinctive sound.  The Wilhelm Scream is a well known sound editors in-joke.  It tends to appear in action films (George Lucas likes to slip it into his) and tends to accompany some on-screen calamity suffered by some back-ground, fictional, henchman.  It's a little game, played for laughs for those in the know.It is HIGHLY disrespectful to assign it to the death cries of an actual person being depicted in a historical drama such as this. I don't know whose idea but they should be reminded what was being depicted.  It was crass and lowered the tone of the whole production for me.  Disbelief was all I had left then.Over all this just made me want to watch the James Cameron version.",2,"Mixed and muddled and, oddly, disrespectful",1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2896,"['So', 'was', 'curious', 'Never', 'watched', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'only', 'one', 'knew', 'had', 'good', 'rep', 'so', 'went', 'expecting', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', 'going', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'snapshot', 'Edwardian', 'society', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'compressed', 'doomed', 'ship', 'end', 'think', 'said', 'more', 'writers', 'people', 'Titanic.What', 'liked', 'actually', 'thought', 'approach', 'was', 'bold', 'did', ""n't"", 'warm', 'characters', 'admire', 'non-misty', 'eyed', 'approach', 'Not', 'everyone', 'was', 'Titanic', 'was', 'likeable', 'not', 'just', 'obvious', 'villains', 'would', 'have', 'grated', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'was', 'lot', 'snobbery', 'class', 'lines', 'were', 'rarely', 'crossed', 'fear', 'masses', 'drove', 'whole', 'thing', 'sending', 'many', 'doom', 'reasons', 'seem', 'horrifying', 'also', 'thought', 'production', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'TV', 'budget', 'few', 'characters', 'were', 'likeable', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'always', 'watchable.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'Maybe', 'went', 'too', 'hard', 'realism', 'maybe', 'was', 'OTT', 'slipping', 'caricature', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'care', 'fates', 'many', 'people', 'depicted', 'well', 'thing', 'Titanic', 'was', 'loss', 'When', 'have', 'cluster', 'nasty', 'people', 'mostly', 'want', 'slap', 'hard', 'see', 'loss', 'tragedy', 'Having', 'story', 'hang', 'off', 'such', 'characters', 'was', 'bold', 'move', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'paid', 'off.The', 'non-linear', 'story', 'telling', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'fact', 'ended', 'where', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'just', 'found', 'utterly', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'impact', 'aside', 'desire', 'smack', 'most', 'people', 'First', 'Class', 'number', 'crew', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'demonisation', 'Captain', 'Smith', 'either', 'was', 'inaccurate', 'portrayal', 'based', 'accounts', ""'ve"", 'read', 'man', 'was', 'utterly', 'unnecessary', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'being', 'controversial', 'sake', 'being', 'controversial', 'know', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'respected', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'moved', 'James', 'Cameron', 'effort', 'imperfect', 'red', 'card', 'though', 'came', 'great', 'ship', 'went', 'down', 'People', 'were', 'falling', 'jumping', 'ice', 'water', 'Jumping', 'deaths', 'was', 'appalled', 'hear', 'very', 'distinctive', 'sound', 'Wilhelm', 'Scream', 'well', 'known', 'sound', 'editors', 'in-joke', 'appear', 'action', 'films', 'George', 'Lucas', 'slip', 'accompany', 'on-screen', 'calamity', 'suffered', 'back-ground', 'fictional', 'henchman', 'little', 'game', 'played', 'laughs', 'know.It', 'HIGHLY', 'disrespectful', 'assign', 'death', 'cries', 'actual', 'person', 'being', 'depicted', 'historical', 'drama', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'idea', 'should', 'be', 'reminded', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'depicted', 'was', 'crass', 'lowered', 'tone', 'whole', 'production', 'Disbelief', 'was', 'had', 'left', 'then.Over', 'just', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'James', 'Cameron', 'version']",Titanic

It sets out to tell the story not just of a single ship, but of an entire society--one that was heading towards its own nemesis in the shape of the First World War as carelessly as Titanic towards the iceberg.This world, soon to vanish forever, is brought alive by a cast of over 80, featuring the cream of acting talent from Britain and beyond, including Linus Roache (Law & Order; Batman Begins), Geraldine Somerville (Harry Potter; Cracker), Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones's Diary; Kingdom), Toby Jones (My Week with Marilyn; Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy; Captain America), Maria Doyle Kennedy (The Tudors; The Commitments), Perdita Weeks (The Promise; The Tudors; Lost in Austen), Jenna-Louise Coleman (Waterloo Road; Emmerdale), Steven Waddington (Sleepy Hollow; Last of the Mohicans), Lyndsey Marshal (Hereafter; Being Human; Rome), Ruth Bradley (Primeval), Peter McDonald (The Damned United; City of Vice) and Timothy West (Bleak House; Ever After; The Day of the Jackal) amongst many others.All human life is on Titanic as she sets out on her maiden voyage. The upper-class family with their suffragette daughter and their warring servants; the wealthy elite of American society; the Irish lawyer in Second Class with his embittered wife; the young cabin steward and the impetuous Italian waiter who falls for her; the Catholic engineer fleeing Belfast with his wife and family to escape the sectarian conflict; the mysterious stranger in Steerage fleeing who knows what. And then there are the officers and crew. As their stories interweave and we find our first impressions are often undermined by what we learn, there is one thing that we know for certain and they do not--that not all of them will survive.Extra Content- 4 x 60 eps with Audio commentary episode 1: Nigel Stafford-Clark, Julian Fellowes, Jon Jones- Titanic - The Making of (35 mins approx)- The Curse of the Titanic Sisters ( 60 mins approx)- Photo gallery- Character and crew profiles- Time lapse set build- Words of the Titanic (60 mins approx)The Curse of the Titanic SistersThey were conceived and created to become the world's biggest, grandest and safest ocean liners: three super liners--The Olympic, Titanic and Britannic--launched and sold as the ships that would never sink. But despite this boast all three were involved in maritime disasters soon after launching. And two of the three--Titanic and Britannic--were lost forever in the most dramatic of circumstances.This one hour film investigates the doomed history and flawed design of the three White Star Liners, from inception to disaster. And it launches a new forensic examination of the wreck of the Britannic, designed to be both bigger and grander than the Titanic. Britannic was the last of the three sisters to launch and extensively modified in the aftermath of the Titanic loss, in order to make sure, unlike her sister, she would prove truly ""unsinkable"".Yet Britannic was lost in 1916 following a mysterious explosion. On a calm sea and under a clear blue sky, she sunk three times faster than her infamous sister Titanic, despite all her extra defenses.By exploring areas deep inside the massive interior of the Britannic, compartments unseen and undisturbed since the day of her sinking, incredible new evidence is revealed to prove what caused the initial explosion and why the doomed ship disappeared beneath the waves so fast. And in doing so new light is thrown on exactly why the three ships created to rule the waves--Titanic, Olympic and Britannic--were actually doomed to fail from the moment their plans were first drawn up.This one hour film investigates the doomed history and flawed design of the three White Star Liners, from inception to disaster.

1526283,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B0074JOCMC,Richard Masloski,"[2, 3]","The claimed catalyst for this four hour miniseries was the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking on April 14, 1912.  If the makers of this TV event truly wanted to commemorate the actual history of Titanic, a better idea might have been to begin with the news of the disaster as it reached the world followed by the American inquest wherein surviving crew and passengers were questioned in an effort to find out the truth of what happened - and these accounts could have led to the flashback structure that is in place in the miniseries.  The difference is this: Julian Fellowes' Forsythe Saga-esque script has less to do with the actual historicity of Titanic and more to do with a grand soap opera dealing with class structure in the early part of the 20th century. The invented characters who interact with some historical personages are, by and large, cardboard cutouts.  Much of what the invented passengers and crew do and say is rather unbelievable and largely cliched.  The miniseries is also laden with historical inaccuracies, despite the producer's and writer's and various other crew members' claims to have striven for absolute accuracy as much as humanly possible.  To realize that the entire production has more to do with its fictions than its facts, one need only watch the second DVD's six making-of featurettes.  On those self-aggrandizing  featurettes very little is said about the historical Titanic and its sinking - and much more is said about what a great miniseries those involved are creating.  As several other Amazonians have said, the true stories of the actual Titanic passengers and crew are far more fascinating and interesting than the made-up characters in this miniseries.Yet despite my hesitations and reservations, this script is actually mostly much better than James Cameron's script for his bloated disaster of a disaster movie.  His fictional folks were truly juvenile and insipid.  When Dawson teaches Rose how to spit like a man just so she can spit into the face of her cardboard villain husband many reels later is just one sad instance of clumsy, overt manipulation of basically shoddy material to begin with.  So the romances and intrigues in this miniseries are, actually, much better conceived and written then the Jack/Rose romance of Cameron's sloppy film.  Having said that, the characters in Julian Fellowes' tale of Titanic are still mainly made of the stuff of soap operas.  Why invent - when true stories still cry out from the ghostly depths of the Sea and Time waiting to be told before they are truly forgotten?  More people know of the phony, fictitious and anachronistic Jack Dawson than they do about Jacques Futrelle.  And that is a true pity.Still-and-all, this take on the great tragedy is still entertaining and worthwhile.  Most anything that has to do with Titanic usually is entertaining in one way or another. Even the '60s TV series TIME TUNNEL's take on Titanic was entertaining. As for the film under dicussion, however, there are other troubles: the interiors of the ship are extremely sub-standard. I'd like to think that the grand staircase was purposefully left out so as not to make viewers long to see Jack Dawnson standing beneath the clock waiting for Rose. But more likely, it was a budgetary concern. The music score is mostly extremely uninspired and therefore annoying.  There is way too much of it and all it does is attempt to push the viewers' buttons and dictate way too obviously what it is we should be feeling since the deep feelings we should be experiencing somehow aren't always there.  Once a viewer gleans just how manipulative the storyline actually is, the ability to empathize and sympathize becomes quite tasked.The overlapping flashback structure of the story is quite interesting and well-reasoned.  It reminded me of CITIZEN KANE's complex structure in many ways.  And in the last episode - which does rally to land a handful of emotional wallops - is an absolutely brilliantly conceived and executed scene of the sinking ship shown as background to the frantic foreground search atop a lifeboat and in the icy waters of one brother trying to find the other.  This one brief scene alone is worth the price of admission. It speaks volumes about individual human loss in relationship and juxtaposition to the larger, background canvas of the great liner's imminent death as it lists and lights blink on and off as it dies and readies to sink. As the ship dies, so dies the one brother's desperate hopes of finding his own brother alive. I daresay that this one sequence gave me a stronger sense of being there than anything in the Cameron depiction of the actual sinking.  It is that brilliant!  Was it scripted and storyboarded as such - or did the CGI folks conceptualize it?  I do not know.  All I know is that it is stunningly realized and executed - as are the truly haunting recreations of the ship slowly sinking below the icy Atlantic as the lifeboat survivors watch in numbed shock and horror.  At this point, the music likewise rallies and matches the scene perfectly.Despite its own faults, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is still the best dramatic recreation of the Titanic tragedy.  The Clifton Webb/Barbara Stanwyck TITANIC is memorable for the truly touching fictional tale that is its main essence.  Cameron's TITANIC goes overboard with way too many special effects - and its fictional story goes overboard...and sinks.  This miniseries, despite its many faults, is still entertaining and worth seeing - if only for that one incredible shot.Bon Voyage!!!",3,JACK DAWSON: MOVE OVER!!!,1340668800,"06 26,

The fictional characters were not engaging or sympathetic, and I was rooting for most of them to drown.

I was wrong on both points -- no redeeming scene, and the screen was so dark that the sinking was hardly visible.

1526285,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0074JOCMC,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[4, 5]","To mark the centennial of the sinking of the Titanic comes a four-part miniseries that combines fictional characters with real-life figures that were on board the doomed vessel as it crossed the Atlantic, exploring the lives of each one prior to the voyage, and their actions once the ship hits the iceberg.The unique thing about this particular retelling is its format: rather than tell the story in chronological order, each episode instead focuses on a particular family, taking us through the circumstances that bring them aboard Titanic and their initial activities on board, all the way up to the evacuation of the ship. It then ends on a cliff-hanger and starts all over again in the next episode, this time focusing on a new group of people. Each time, little sequences involving minor characters will be strewn throughout the main action, their meaning not becoming clear until the next episode sheds further light on their context.To be honest, I'm not sure how successful this idea was. Although a second viewing makes many things much clearer, the first time around it's terribly confusing. There are far too many characters introduced in too short a space of time to keep track of them all, and several intercutting scenes seem random and pointless the first time you see them. It may have looked good on paper; this intricate weaving of characters and storylines as they head toward the inevitable, but in execution it doesn't quite gel. Perhaps it all would have worked better as a straightforward drama, with no choppy back-and-forthing in the order of events, but a slow boil up to the disaster after having gotten to know the characters first.But of course, nothing concerning the Titanic could ever be dull: the glamorous setting, the impending disaster, the devastating conceit of a ship sinking beneath your feet without enough lifeboats for everyone on board. How can it ever be anything but riveting? So many different components make the story of the Titanic so compelling: that it was the most expensive and biggest ship of its age, that it was vaunted as ""unsinkable"", that it was on its maiden voyage, that it collided with the iceberg just on midnight, that it's one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history - any one of these things would have made the story unforgettable, but that it was such a perfect storm of iconic facts and figures means that were it was a work of fiction it would be derided as far too improbable.Your heart starts pounding as soon as the iceberg makes its first appearance, and here the actual hitting of the iceberg is beautifully staged: the instrument of doom is a silent, alien presence that glides past the boat, does its damage, and disappears into the darkness. This adaptation understands that a disaster of this magnitude doesn't just *happen*, that there are a thousand little mistakes and chances and what-might-have-beens that caused the ship to sink, all conspiring against those on board. This mini-series is far more informative than theJames Cameron filmin exploring some of the reasons why the disaster was one of such magnitude: the lack of binoculars, the calm sea, the rumors that she was going too fast, the lack of lifeboats, the poorly managed evacuation, and other attributing factors.It's easy enough to tell which characters are the creation of screenwriter Julian Fellowes and which are based on real people who were on board the Titanic at the time. Among the aristocracy are the Earl of Manton, travelling first class with his snobby wife Louisa and suffragette daughter Georgiana, who carries a guilty secret with him. With them are their servants, Barnes and Watson, the former holding something of a torch for the latter (though goodness knows why, as she's perpetually surly and sulky). Over the course of the episode, they rub shoulders with the likes of Benjamin Guggenheim, L&eacute;ontine Aubert, the Countess of Rothes, Jack Thayer, Harry Elkins Widener, John Aster, Dorothy Gibson, Molly Brown, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, and other members of the upperclass who were real passengers at the time.The second episode concentrates more on the second class, represented mainly by John Batley, a lawyer to Manton, and his wife Muriel, who is fed up with being looked down upon by her husband's employers. This episode also explores more of the mistakes that led to the sinking, from the conference room of the White Star, where Bruce Ismay and Thomas Andrews argue over safety regulations, and on board ship, where Captain Smith debates weather conditions and the ship's speed with figures such as First Officer Murdoch and Second Officer Lightoller. These aspects are quite informative, shedding light on some aspects of design and circumstance that I was not aware of (particularly the dismissal of David Blair before the voyage, leading to the absence of binoculars on board ship after he left with the key to the case).The third episode deals with the third class, namely the Irish family: Jim and Mary Maloney and their children, seeking a new life in America. On board ship, Mary is somewhat unsettled by the presence of a stowaway that she recognizes as ""Peter the Painter"", an Irish terrorist/revolutionary (who may or may not have been a real person, having never been found by the authorities). Elsewhere, Italian brothers Mario and Paolo Sandrini get jobs on board ship, and Paolo is instantly smitten by the stewardess Annie Desmond.The final episode is the only one to actually begin on-board ship and begin to weave together all the storylines. Here the cliffhangers are resolved, and we find out who lives and who dies (well, among the fictional characters at least). From a technical point of view, the production is well put together, though undoubtedly on a budget. However else you feel about James Cameron's blockbuster film, it was the definitive portrayal of the Titanic in terms of scale and authenticity, and here the sets look small and the special-effects rather obvious in comparison. The ensemble cast is very good, with a few particular standouts (Steven Campbell Moore, Jenna Louise Coleman, Toby Jones, Steven Waddington, and Diana Kent, who with the delivery of one line - ""my son cannot swim"" - will break your heart) and it's clear that we're watching a screenplay by Julian Fellowes when it comes to the little gems of dialogue: ""No one is more morally indignant than a beauty the wrong side of forty,"" and ""Next time we're in a disaster, make sure it's not with foreigners,"" and in a discussion concerning whether someone is Irish: ""if I grew up in a kennel, would it make me a dog?"" and the darkly ironic ""I hope one day [your mother] will be able to forgive us,"" to the shipmate dismissed from duty just before the Titanic leaves port.Yet it feels like what Julian Fellowes really wanted to write was ""Downton Abbeyon a Boat"", meaning that the first half of each episode is spent on his favourite subjects: the class divide, intrigues among the aristocracy and staff, no less than four blossoming love affairs, and so on; only for that pesky iceberg to put an abrupt halt to all the stories and start up something completely different. Stories that are started don't feel finished - and though you can naturally say that this was the precise point of the drama, in that a life's course can change in a heartbeat - it also feels oddly unsatisfying. The fates of many characters remain unclear, and the ambitions, heartbreaks and familial intrigues that were established before the disaster aren't given any closure. (Like, what happened with the nursemaid with the baby? What was the deal with the Irish wife and the terrorist? And what about Lord Manton's illegitimate daughter?) It almost feels like we're watching two different shows at the same time: a period drama and a disaster film.There other things that don't work (a child would never run away from their mother in a crisis, I don't care how terrified they are, for people facing a watery grave, many of them manage to come up with remarkably eloquent final speeches, and despite the class divide being Julian Fellowes's forte, here it's simplified into aristocratic snobs versus resentful working class) but on the whole, for a mini-series that only exists thanks to the centennial of the actual sinking, it's informative, effective and memorable.The special features include the usual extras, including a DVD commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes and profiles on the cast, but of more interest is the third disc, containing a documentary that involves the casting of actors as various real-life passengers, reciting the accounts they made as though being interviewed. This includes several British stars such as Richard E. Grant, Joseph Mawle, Roger Allam, Claudie Blackley, Nancy Carroll, Anna Madeley, Isabella Rita, and James Wilby. Narrated by Charles Dance, it's an innovative idea, and a nice companion to the mini-series.",4,"""But We Can't be in Any Real Danger...Not On This Ship...""",1344556800,"08 10,

1526286,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0074JOCMC,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 3]","Whether you tend to like Julian Fellowes' ""Titanic"" for the centenary of the ship's tragic demise really depends on your approach to the material: if you want a quality fact-based drama, this film is not for you; if you want a soap opera based on class divisions, conjecture, and fictionalized characterizations, this might possibly satisfy. The production is long and highly fragmented, is told with much non-linearity and from multiple viewpoints, is somewhat repetitive, and is frequently just plain boring.The actual sinking of the ""Titanic"" is certainly a dramatic enough story without introducing scads of characters it was impossible to identify with, and even harder to care about. As but one example, I found the improbable and impetuous relationship between Italian waiter Paulo (Glen Blackhall) and a British maid to be exquisitely painful and cloying, and probably the single most annoying ""highlight"" of the movie (though other onboard relationships fared little better.) The film had decent sets and middling effects (they certainly don't hold a candle to James Cameron's megabudget blockbuster) and the DVD comes with a few token extras, mostly related to the making of the movie.I have been interested in the ""Titanic"" since reading Walter Lord's masterpiece ""A Night to Remember"" as a boy (the film of the same name is still the best of the ""Titanic"" lot) and was genuinely looking forward to this miniseries. Sadly, it is one of the lesser ""Titanic"" cinematic outings, although for people who tend to romanticize the accident it is full of intrigue, lurid details, and characters that are largely imaginary. Despite some strong performances (and some naturally much more appropriate to a soap opera) this presentation is highly fragmented for viewing (due to point of view and commercial break issues) and is far less compelling or interesting than it should and could have been. I never thought a film about the most dramatic shipwreck in modern history could be so boring.The story we all know so well should have been told much better, and lensing the movie in highly fragmented ""Soap Opera-vision"" was a very poor choice. Julian Fellowes' script is not genuinely instructional about the accident and contributes little towards understanding or appreciating the wreck and its significance to early twentieth century American and English culture as the world entered the machine age.

The eagerly awaited Titanic miniseries penned by Julian Fellowes of Gosford Park and Downton Abbey fame, introduced several interesting characters; however, the four-hour allotted time didn't allow any of these characters to develop.  Sketches and black and white outlines of Lords, Ladies, Molly Brown, stewards, maids and an early film star are all we were left with.  If the series had been six or more episodes it may have worked, but alas, four hours was not adequate time to get to know at least twenty major characters.  Let's face it, Fellowes forte is the character study and sadly, he was not allowed to do that in Titanic.Two performances sparkled - Glen Blackhall as Italian steward, Paolo Sandrini and Jenna-Louise Coleman as Annie Desmond, his love interest. These two young actors brightened the screen and stole every scene in which they appeared.  I dare say that these were the only characters that seemed real and sympathetic.  These talented young actors are ones to watch!  Several great actors like James Wilby, Celia Imrie and David Calder (as Captain Smith) were all but wasted.  The character of Captain Smith basically walked on and then walked off - too bad, for history relates Smith as a remarkable fellow.The issue of social class was handled rather heavy-handedly, making it seem as if one social class looked upon the other as pariahs.  This may have happened in certain circumstances, but not to the extent the film portrayed it.Costumes, sets and the ship all looked authentic, but without the flesh and blood characters, just not engaging enough to make the four-hour series entertaining.",2,"Lackluster, but could have been great!",1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,1788,"['talent', 'aboard', 'miniseries', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'extraordinary', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lackluster', 'dull', 'four', 'hours', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'Titanic', 'miniseries', 'penned', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'fame', 'introduced', 'several', 'interesting', 'characters', 'however', 'four-hour', 'allotted', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'characters', 'develop', 'Sketches', 'black', 'white', 'outlines', 'Lords', 'Ladies', 'Molly', 'Brown', 'stewards', 'maids', 'early', 'film', 'star', 'are', 'were', 'left', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'six', 'more', 'episodes', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'alas', 'four', 'hours', 'was', 'not', 'adequate', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'least', 'twenty', 'major', 'characters', 'Let', 'face', 'Fellowes', 'forte', 'character', 'study', 'sadly', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'do', 'Titanic.Two', 'performances', 'sparkled', 'Glen', 'Blackhall', 'Italian', 'steward', 'Paolo', 'Sandrini', 'Jenna-Louise', 'Coleman', 'Annie', 'Desmond', 'love', 'interest', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'brightened', 'screen', 'stole', 'scene', 'appeared', 'dare', 'say', 'were', 'only', 'characters', 'seemed', 'real', 'sympathetic', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'ones', 'watch', 'Several', 'great', 'actors', 'James', 'Wilby', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'David', 'Calder', 'Captain', 'Smith', 'were', 'wasted', 'character', 'Captain', 'Smith', 'basically', 'walked', 'then', 'walked', 'off', 'too', 'bad', 'history', 'relates', 'Smith', 'remarkable', 'fellow.The', 'issue', 'social', 'class', 'was', 'handled', 'rather', 'heavy-handedly', 'making', 'seem', 'one', 'social', 'class', 'looked', 'other', 'pariahs', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'not', 'extent', 'film', 'portrayed', 'it.Costumes', 'sets', 'ship', 'looked', 'authentic', 'flesh', 'blood', 'characters', 'just', 'not', 'engaging', 'enough', 'make', 'four-hour', 'series', 'entertaining']",Titanic

1526293,A1TEX8B0WPHVBS,B0074JOCMC,"William Porter ""William Porter Photography""","[7, 10]","The sinking of the Titanic is one of the best-documented disasters in history, and the 2200 or so souls on board the ship when it hit the iceberg provide an extraordinarily rich treasure trove for any story teller. Julian Fellowes' four-part telling of the story is much truer to the variety of stories involved than James Cameron's. Indeed, I think the Fellowes version is an extraordinary achievement.And my wife and I found the Fellowes' version truly moving, at many points. The only moment in Cameron's movie that I found even the slightest bit affecting was when the elderly Rose (played wonderfully by Gloria Stuart) drops the Heart of the Ocean off the back of the research ship. But that of course has NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE TRUTH. It's a nice little moment of made-up drama, but for Pete's sake, the Titanic disaster doesn't need any help in the drama department! Cameron has so little dramatic imagination that he has to USE the Titanic story as a framework on to which to graft what he thinks will really grab people, the idiotic romance between the drifter Jack and the upper-class brat Rose. Fellowes' Titanic also makes stuff up, but its fictions are more closely tied to the disaster and at no point overwhelm it. He touches on several very credible love stories: young Widener (a historical character) and the rich beauty played by Perdita Weeks; Toby Jones's lawyer and his wife; the Italian waiter and the second-class stewardess or maid; and touches on several others. But these situations don't compete with the historical fact of the sinking. Rather they illuminate it by giving you some sense of the incredible heartbreak involved in falling or being in love when death is staring you in the face. Reminds me of the phone good-byes from 9/11 victims. Every story adds a piece to the big picture, and viewed together, they allow you to get a sense of the magnitude of the suffering experienced by those directly involved.Fellowes' Titanic screenplay is, I think, nothing short of brilliant, one of the most intellectually appealing screenplays I can think of, ever. In each of the four episodes, he tells the general story of the sinking of the Titanic from a different perspective. The first episode views the disaster largely from the first-class; the second, largely from the second class; and the third from the third class. These different narratives intersect at a number of points in interesting ways, for example, in one episode you see a quarrel between a second-class husband and wife from their perspective, with the maid in the background; in the following episode you see a bit of the same quarrel but this time from the maid's perspective. The effect is contrapuntal, indeed, fugal. (I think Browning's great poem The Ring and the Book may do something similar but I read it decades ago.) In the fourth episode, all of the classes and all of the stories get dumped into the ocean, that is, the stories all come together sub specie aeternitatis, or if that is too grand, sub specie humanitatis -- from the perspective not of a single social class but of Humanity in general.True, there is no chase scene in the Fellowes' version, no gunfight, no thrilling helicopter photography showing a mediocre actor on the bow yelling ""I'm the king of the world"". In Fellowes' story a lower-class waiter with a lot of nerve may dare to wink at a pretty girl in first class but he's going to get scolded for it immediately, and he certainly isn't going to fall in love with her or her with him. If you prefer your history to be massively fictionalized to suit modern-day sensibilities, then by all means, skip this version and stick to Cameron's. You will have plenty of company.But Fellowes' version tells the story of the Titanic -- and sketches the many stories of its passengers -- more honestly, and more dramatically. I think this is about as good as television gets.*One or two loose ends...I didn't see the shows when they were broadcast. I rented the Blu-Ray the instant it became available (just a few days ago) and watched all four episodes in two nights. I think watching the episodes together like this is probably desirable. Next time I think I'll watch the whole thing in one sitting. It certainly makes it much easier to see the points where the episodes intersect when your memory of previous episodes is fresh.When I popped the first disk in the player, I was pretty sure the special effects would be mediocre at best. I was wrong. They are top notch. I have to say that I think they are SUPERIOR to Cameron's version. Let me explain what i mean. Cameron's Titanic reminds me of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, in that both took quite interesting stories, vulgarized them, and produced movies that remain watchable only for the special effects. The CGI work in Fellowes' Titanic is brilliantly done and as convincing as it needs to be without competing with the drama. Another analogy: The film Gettysburg does a better job of depicting the drama of battle as experienced by the soldiers than Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, even though the former uses no expensive effects to show people's heads blown off ""realistically"". THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE BREAK BETWEEN DRAMA AND REALITY and when drama tries too hard to LOOK real, it simply leaves you admiring the artifice. (Ars celare artem, as they used to say.)The Fellowes' version has no memorable music or theme, unlike Gosford Park or Downton Abbey. I noticed this only after I had finished episode four. It is not a lack, I think. I certainly didn't miss it.",5,"Beautiful, moving drama -- and ten times better than Cameron's blockbuster",1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,5554,"['sinking', 'Titanic', 'one', 'best-documented',
