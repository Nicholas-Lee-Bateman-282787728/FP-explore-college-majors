799781,A30KQVQI3WI4L7,B0001CNN4C,Craig Martin,"[2, 2]","As with many an exploitation film, the promotional poster promises more than the film - any film, in fact - can realistically deliver, and Blood Beach is no exception. The image of a slender college-aged girl waste deep in sand with arms outstretched and a look of terror and pain on her face is certainly arresting. Even more interesting and certainly very shrewd is the tag line for the film, which piggy-backed on Jaws 2's marketing campaign that told audiences, ""Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water."" Blood Beach adds the line ""... you can't get there"". The intertextual strategy paid off so that Blood Beach's producers laughed all the way to the bank. The film lacks the drama of the poster and the satire of the tagline - despite it being unintentionally funny - but it has a lot going for it, such as a couple of surprise deaths that add a genuine sense of ubiquitous threat and danger. Complaints about the monster in other reviews are a little too pedantic, especially because the thrill of the film is not the monster, but what it does - how it dispatches its victims, which is so simple but very stylish. Sometimes I'm not sure if some viewers actually understand what exploitation films are about.",3,Classic schlock that is thoroughly entertaining ...,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,1232,"['many', 'exploitation', 'film', 'promotional', 'poster', 'more', 'film', 'film', 'fact', 'can', 'realistically', 'deliver', 'Blood', 'Beach', 'exception', 'image', 'slender', 'college-aged', 'girl', 'waste', 'deep', 'sand', 'arms', 'outstretched', 'look', 'terror', 'pain', 'face', 'certainly', 'arresting', 'Even', 'more', 'interesting', 'certainly', 'very', 'shrewd', 'tag', 'line', 'film', 'piggy-backed', 'Jaws', '2', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'told', 'audiences', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'safe', 'go', 'back', 'water', 'Blood', 'Beach', 'line', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'there', 'intertextual', 'strategy', 'paid', 'off', 'Blood', 'Beach', 'producers', 'laughed', 'way', 'bank', 'film', 'drama', 'poster', 'satire', 'tagline', 'being', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'lot', 'going', 'such', 'couple', 'surprise', 'deaths', 'add', 'genuine', 'sense', 'ubiquitous', 'threat', 'danger', 'Complaints', 'monster', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'pedantic', 'especially', 'thrill', 'film', 'not', 'monster', 'what', 'how', 'victims', 'so', 'simple', 'very', 'stylish', 'Sometimes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'viewers', 'actually', 'understand', 'what', 'exploitation', 'films', 'are']",Blood Beach

799783,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0001CNN4C,Einsatz,"[1, 1]","I haven't seen this movie in decades.  But it was something I vividly recalled and hoped to find on DVD one day.  That day is now.  Having just watched it, it's exactly as I remembered.  This is not your typical horror film.  There's something under the beach.  It grabs unsuspecting people and pulls them under.  There is no blood, no gore (despite the salacious illustration on the DVD cover).  It's really quite tidy, one moment there, gone the next.  The first to go, rather noisily, is an old woman.  The only witness is a shopping cart lady given to ominous portents but no real help.  When the police finally catch on to the fact that people have gone missing, is the beach closed?  No, it's dug up and set back again in perfect order.  For all the good that does.Throughout, no matter what happens, there's never a sense of urgency.  But there is an overriding sense of melancholy.  That's part of the reason I like this movie so much, it's very nonchalant about the idea of a creature snatching passersby morning, noon, or nighttime.  No one gets overly excited; the danger is minimalized.  It's always business as usual.  John Saxon plays the captain in charge of dealing with the ""problem.""  Burt Young plays Sergeant Royko, a man given to wistful recollections about Chicago.  David Huffman plays Harry Caulder who loses one girlfriend only to quickly gain another (the daughter of the first victim and, as luck or plotting would have it, an old girlfriend he briefly considered marrying).  He's the only character even remotely interested in pursuing this mystery.  But he's in no hurry to solve it.  No one is.  It's all quite casual, dress or come as you are.(On a sad note, actor David Huffman was murdered a few years after this movie was made.)",5,"""Grown men don't believe in monsters.""",1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,1762,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'decades', 'was', 'something', 'vividly', 'recalled', 'hoped', 'find', 'DVD', 'one', 'day', 'day', 'now', 'Having', 'just', 'watched', 'exactly', 'remembered', 'not', 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'something', 'beach', 'grabs', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'blood', 'gore', 'salacious', 'illustration', 'DVD', 'cover', 'really', 'quite', 'tidy', 'one', 'moment', 'there', 'gone', 'next', 'first', 'go', 'rather', 'noisily', 'old', 'woman', 'only', 'witness', 'shopping', 'cart', 'lady', 'given', 'ominous', 'portents', 'real', 'help', 'When', 'police', 'finally', 'catch', 'fact', 'people', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'beach', 'closed', 'No', 'dug', 'up', 'set', 'back', 'again', 'perfect', 'order', 'good', 'does.Throughout', 'matter', 'what', 'never', 'sense', 'urgency', 'overriding', 'sense', 'melancholy', 'part', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'nonchalant', 'idea', 'creature', 'snatching', 'passersby', 'morning', 'noon', 'nighttime', 'one', 'overly', 'excited', 'danger', 'minimalized', 'always', 'business', 'usual', 'John', 'Saxon', 'captain', 'charge', 'dealing', 'problem', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Sergeant', 'Royko', 'man', 'given', 'wistful', 'recollections', 'Chicago', 'David', 'Huffman', 'Harry', 'Caulder', 'who', 'one', 'girlfriend', 'only', 'quickly', 'gain', 'daughter', 'first', 'victim', 'luck', 'plotting', 'would', 'have', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'considered', 'marrying', 'only', 'character', 'even', 'remotely', 'interested', 'pursuing', 'mystery', 'hurry', 'solve', 'one', 'quite', 'casual', 'dress', 'come', 'are', 'sad', 'note', 'actor', 'David', 'Huffman', 'was', 'murdered', 'few', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'made']",Blood Beach

799788,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B0001CNN4C,John's Horror Corner,"[2, 2]","This is basically a bad relationship movie that happens to have a sand monster in it.  Just terrible!  I would only recommend this to the most adventurous of bad horror connoisseurs.In the opening scene an old lady is walking her dog on the beach and she is pulled into the sand by some ""thing.""  As she is pulled down screaming, before the release of Tremors (1990) by the way, her dog frantically barks for help.  A cat would have just watched her with contempt.  I'm just saying dogs are better pets in horror movies, that's all.  Moving on...With the help of her ex-boyfriend, beach patrol man Harry, Catherine investigates her mother's disappearance.  It's been a while and there's still a spark there, but Harry is involved with someone else.  Luckily his girlfriend is eaten by the beach and he can devote his energy to Catherine, who he just learned is getting a divorce from her husband.After racking up a decapitated dog, a mutilated woman and a castrated rapist, police captain Pearson (John Saxon; John Saxon; A Nightmare on Elm Street, Black Christmas, Tenebre) and Sgt. Royko (Burt Young; the Rocky series; Amityville II) are entertaining sea monster theories from their police scientist (Stefan Gierasch; Carrie, Spellbinder), who presents some pretty radical evolutionary theories about moving from sea to land and ""learning to walk"" considering he's never seen a specimen and his theories grow more insane later in the movie.I'm guessing they put all the blood into the title because there is almost no blood in Blood Beach.  The gore isn't the only aspect of the movie that falls short.  The acting is weak (but that should come as no surprise), it drags along and the deaths are unexciting.  In fact, nothing about this movie was exciting.  People are being forcefully dragged to their doom and I'm watching waiting for something cool to happen...that should be the cool thing!!!!  Yet the victems behave like they're in quicksand.  And WAY too much attention is paid to Harry and Catherine's relationship, which is also painfully boring and got a LOT of screentime.  The most damning thing is that this movie featured the least exciting violent penis amputation in the history of film!  Such a scene typically comes with a wince, a gasp or even laughter (e.g., Piranha 3D and Piranha 3DD).In the end they find the monster's lair and we see the beast. What a disappointment.
