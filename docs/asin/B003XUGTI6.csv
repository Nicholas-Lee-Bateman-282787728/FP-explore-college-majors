Otherwise, I liked almost everything in this sci-fi flick but the `Afterschool Special' problems with the teens.  I suppose they thought it would humanize the situation by including a REAL family with REAL problems.....meanwhile; the world is going up the big drain in the sky.  I don't think petty little problems with smelly cars and ex-boyfriends rise to the same level as THE WORLD COMING TO AN END!  This part of the movie didn't hold my interest for one minute.  Instead, I found myself lost to the hope that they would just drop that part of the story and carry on with the matter at hand....saving the world.  Sad to say they didn't.

If you could see the credits at the begining of the movie rather than at the end yould see that it was filmed in Lousiana by a small local production company. The result is less than mediocor. Peter Jurasic does do his usual excelent job of presenting a complex charicter for all three minutes he's on screen, but everyone else's performance is somewhere around the level of a highschool play. The idea of a quantum 'something' eating the earth and being saved at the last minute by a 'rain-man' with a nuclear missel which results in a time loop is interesting, but the sub plot of a highschool romance and a complete disregard of anything like real physics, coupled with a paint by numbers script leads me to give this movie only a D+, and that + only because it wasn't bad enough to make me angry that I watched it.

From surprisingly decent low-budget dramatic films to B-Movies like 'Quantum Apocalypse'. The spectrum of their products is wide and varied, and as a cinephile, I'm appreciative.In 'Quantum' humanity is faced with a rogue space anomaly, one that will slowly shred our planet like a cosmic wood chipper. Who survives and who doesn't - and does anyone survive at all? Features a diverse ensemble cast with many scifi veterans like Peter Jurasik and Stephanie Jacobsen.My biggest enjoyment was the difficulty in figuring out who the hero was going to be. So when it turned out to be a character with a mental disability, I enjoyed it that much more. Not because he was disabled, but because I had written him off as a politically-correct throwaway role. The director caught me off guard, which I like when it comes to any cookie cutter production.The remainder of the cast did fine, nothing special, but nothing terrible - with one exception. One of the 'stars', or at least one of the more recognizable names, was Gigi Edgley. Surprisingly, I found her performance grating and unappealing. Her kitschy character was so good in 'Farscape', that I expected much more from her. Unfortunately, as the rock-n-roll theoretical physicist, she delivers a very similar performance to that of Chiana - but this time coming off as ridiculously ham-fisted and breathlessly overacted. Apparently white body paint and skintight spandex makes more of a difference than I thought.Still, the script was fairly well done; the dialogue decently written and authentic sounding with only minor incursions of clich&eacute;. Infinitely better than a lot of similar DTV disaster flicks I've screened recently.This is one of those budget movies that, given a bit more funding, might've pulled off something really good. Overall, I wasn't displeased with the rental fee.Movie Note: Typical for these kinds of films - the stunning box art imagery is not seen in the movie. However, there were some interesting sfx. Example: When the mayor and his son save the life of a woman trapped under a car by simply lifting it off her, al&agrave; Superman style. Reason: Low gravity. Wish they had more of that, but again, B-Movie budget. And the kinds of massive visual destruction one hopes to see is limited to cheap rips of 'The Day After Tomorrow' - apparently this software is now widely available since I see it used in just about every single disaster flick nowadays. &lt;g>",3,"""100% Screwed""",1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,2650,"['Ya', 'got', 'ta', 'DTV', 'movie', 'when', 'one', 'chapters', 'titled', '100', '%', 'Screwed', 'lt', '>', 'current', 'version', 'First', 'Look', 'Studios', 'similar', 'Asylum', 'production', 'company', 'interesting', 'fare', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'low-budget', 'dramatic', 'films', 'B-Movies', ""'Quantum"", 'Apocalypse', 'spectrum', 'products', 'wide', 'varied', 'cinephile', ""'m"", 'appreciative.In', ""'Quantum"", 'humanity', 'faced', 'rogue', 'space', 'anomaly', 'one', 'will', 'slowly', 'shred', 'planet', 'cosmic', 'wood', 'chipper', 'Who', 'who', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'survive', 'Features', 'diverse', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'many', 'scifi', 'veterans', 'Peter', 'Jurasik', 'Stephanie', 'Jacobsen.My', 'biggest', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'difficulty', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'hero', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'So', 'when', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'character', 'mental', 'disability', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'more', 'Not', 'was', 'disabled', 'had', 'written', 'off', 'politically-correct', 'throwaway', 'role', 'director', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'like', 'when', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'production.The', 'remainder', 'cast', 'did', 'fine', 'nothing', 'special', 'nothing', 'terrible', 'one', 'exception', 'One', ""'stars"", 'least', 'one', 'more', 'recognizable', 'names', 'was', 'Gigi', 'Edgley', 'Surprisingly', 'found', 'performance', 'grating', 'unappealing', 'kitschy', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'good', ""'Farscape"", 'expected', 'much', 'more', 'Unfortunately', 'rock-n-roll', 'theoretical', 'physicist', 'very', 'similar', 'performance', 'Chiana', 'time', 'coming', 'off', 'ridiculously', 'ham-fisted', 'breathlessly', 'overacted', 'Apparently', 'white', 'body', 'paint', 'skintight', 'spandex', 'more', 'difference', 'thought.Still', 'script', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'dialogue', 'decently', 'written', 'authentic', 'sounding', 'only', 'minor', 'incursions', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Infinitely', 'better', 'lot', 'similar', 'DTV', 'disaster', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'screened', 'recently.This', 'one', 'budget', 'movies', 'given', 'bit', 'more', 'funding', 'might', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'off', 'something', 'really', 'good', 'Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'displeased', 'rental', 'fee.Movie', 'Note', 'Typical', 'kinds', 'films', 'stunning', 'box', 'art', 'imagery', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'However', 'were', 'interesting', 'sfx', 'Example', 'When', 'mayor', 'son', 'save', 'life', 'woman', 'trapped', 'car', 'simply', 'lifting', 'al', 'agrave', 'Superman', 'style', 'Reason', 'Low', 'gravity', 'Wish', 'had', 'more', 'again', 'B-Movie', 'budget', 'kinds', 'massive', 'visual', 'destruction', 'one', 'see', 'limited', 'cheap', 'rips', ""'The"", 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'apparently', 'software', 'now', 'widely', 'available', 'see', 'used', 'just', 'single', 'disaster', 'flick', 'nowadays', 'lt', '>']",N/A
