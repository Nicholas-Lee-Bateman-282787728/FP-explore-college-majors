This is a very disturbing, occasionally hard to watch film.  Viewers with sensitive constitutions should be forewarned.It's not so much that it's gory--although it is a bit, but Fox understands that the key to the effect he's shooting for is character development.  So this is ultimately a small ensemble film--five characters in a couple of rooms, and we get to know all of these characters very well, thanks to both the writing, by Wil Zmak, and a fine set of performances.  The characters are fully fleshed out and we can either identify and/or sympathize with them, so when some of them do terrible things to others, it has a lot more impact, and even when it's only a threat and there's nothing graphic about it, we feel it almost as if these events were happening to friends.  The Dark Hours is very literally a psychological film, a fact reflected in its main character's occupation and the circumstances of the villainous characters.It's also a ""rubber reality"" film--those are defined partially through ""shifting"" realities, where we as an audience, usually along with at least some characters, don't know quite what was real, if anything.  After the recent spate of rubber reality films that all used essentially the same plot--including Stay (2005), The Jacket (2005), November (2004), The I Inside (2003), and eight or nine others going at least all the way back to Jacob's Ladder (1990) and the short The Awakening (1990)--The Dark Hours very refreshingly uses different kinds of twists in its questionably hallucinatory succession of scenes.  The ending of the film is clear enough while still being nicely ambiguous.  There is also an alternate ending on the DVD that is less ambiguous, but I don't think it works nearly as well.  More ambiguity is better in a film like this.And if you want themes and subtexts, Fox has them here in spades, including the desperation of those who know they're dying, the classic ""who's crazy"" conundrum between psychiatric professionals and their patients, and the turmoil of disintegrating relationships.But you don't have to pay attention to that stuff to enjoy this excellent film.  Just sit back and squirm.",5,Squirmy Goodness,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,2274,"['Director', 'Paul', 'Fox', 'Dark', 'Hours', 'one', 'thing', 'extremely', 'well', 'staple', 'horror', 'squirm', 'very', 'disturbing', 'occasionally', 'hard', 'watch', 'film', 'Viewers', 'sensitive', 'constitutions', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned.It', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'gory', 'bit', 'Fox', 'key', 'effect', 'shooting', 'character', 'development', 'ultimately', 'small', 'ensemble', 'film', 'five', 'characters', 'couple', 'rooms', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'thanks', 'writing', 'Wil', 'Zmak', 'fine', 'set', 'performances', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'can', 'either', 'identify', 'and/or', 'sympathize', 'so', 'when', 'do', 'terrible', 'things', 'others', 'lot', 'more', 'impact', 'even', 'when', 'only', 'threat', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'feel', 'almost', 'events', 'were', 'happening', 'friends', 'Dark', 'Hours', 'very', 'literally', 'psychological', 'film', 'fact', 'reflected', 'main', 'character', 'occupation', 'circumstances', 'villainous', 'characters.It', 'also', 'rubber', 'reality', 'film', 'are', 'defined', 'partially', 'shifting', 'realities', 'where', 'audience', 'usually', 'least', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'anything', 'recent', 'spate', 'rubber', 'reality', 'films', 'used', 'essentially', 'same', 'plot', 'including', 'Stay', '2005', 'Jacket', '2005', 'November', '2004', 'Inside', '2003', 'eight', 'nine', 'others', 'going', 'least', 'way', 'back', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', '1990', 'short', 'Awakening', '1990', 'Dark', 'Hours', 'very', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'kinds', 'twists', 'questionably', 'hallucinatory', 'succession', 'scenes', 'ending', 'film', 'clear', 'enough', 'still', 'being', 'nicely', 'ambiguous', 'also', 'alternate', 'ending', 'DVD', 'less', 'ambiguous', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'More', 'ambiguity', 'better', 'film', 'this.And', 'want', 'themes', 'subtexts', 'Fox', 'here', 'spades', 'including', 'desperation', 'who', 'know', ""'re"", 'dying', 'classic', 'who', 'crazy', 'conundrum', 'psychiatric', 'professionals', 'patients', 'turmoil', 'disintegrating', 'relationships.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'stuff', 'enjoy', 'excellent', 'film', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'squirm']",The Dark Hours

I was pretty confused even as the credits were up and rolling.  Confused in a good way.  A way that made me want to go back and watch it all over again.

958768,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000CGX7FC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Dark Hours (Paul Fox, 2005)Another one of those movies that got lost in the shuffle over the years for some reason, The Dark Hours is actually a pretty solid little psychological thriller. It loses its way a little in the end, which tries to tread the line between confusing and ambiguous and comes up on the wrong side of it, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying it for what it is--a thriller without too many pretensions. It just wants to entertain you. And it will.Samantha Goodman (Kate Greenhouse, currently appearing in the TV series Murdoch Mysteries) is a psychiatrist who works at a mental institution. She has a secret, though; she's got a brain anomaly of her own, a tumor that she'd been able to keep in check for years with medication, but which has suddenly started growing again. After a particularly nasty session with a patient, Harlan Pyne (Dolan's Cadillac's Aidan Devine), where she judges that he needs to remain confined, she, her husband, and her sister Melody (The Exorcism of Emily Rose's Iris Graham), who also works as her husband's editorial assistant, head off to their remote cabin for the weekend to decompress. Things start to go wrong when Adrian (You Might As Well Live's Dov Tiefenbach) shows up, claiming a breakdown; he's just a shill however, for Harlan Pyne, who's escaped the hospital and now plans revenge on Samantha by hurting those closest to her.It all sound pretty straightforward, and for the most part it is. That is not necessarily a bad thing; a good thriller, crafted well, is usually worth watching. Fox (Everything's Gone Green) and screenwriter Wil Zmak (on his first feature-length assignment), though, are after something more. It's frustrating that they almost-but-not-quite manage it in the final ten minutes of this movie, but enough of what they were after actually made it into the movie that you can pick up on what they were doing without having to have it entirely spelled out for you (in other words, the ending works better that that of Twohy's A Perfect Getaway, but not as well as Singer's The Usual Suspects). There's mostly solid acting to be found here, and Fox knows where to put a camera and the lights to get atmosphere out of a scene; what more could you ask for in a thriller, really, other than a slightly better-crafted ending? This one has been much-overlooked for the past five years. Pick a copy up and help rectify that at your earliest convenience. *** ",4,Much better than expected.,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,2445,"['Dark', 'Hours', 'Paul', 'Fox', '2005', 'one', 'movies', 'got', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'years', 'reason', 'Dark', 'Hours', 'actually', 'pretty', 'solid', 'little', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'way', 'little', 'end', 'tread', 'line', 'confusing', 'ambiguous', 'up', 'wrong', 'side', 'should', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'what', 'thriller', 'too', 'many', 'pretensions', 'just', 'entertain', 'Goodman', 'Kate', 'Greenhouse', 'currently', 'appearing', 'TV', 'series', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'mental', 'institution', 'secret', 'though', 'got', 'brain', 'anomaly', 'own', 'tumor', ""'d"", 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'check', 'years', 'medication', 'suddenly', 'started', 'growing', 'again', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'session', 'patient', 'Harlan', 'Pyne', 'Dolan', 'Cadillac', 'Aidan', 'Devine', 'where', 'judges', 'remain', 'confined', 'husband', 'sister', 'Melody', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Iris', 'Graham', 'who', 'also', 'husband', 'editorial', 'assistant', 'head', 'remote', 'cabin', 'weekend', 'decompress', 'Things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'Adrian', 'Might', 'As', 'Well', 'Live', 'Dov', 'Tiefenbach', 'up', 'claiming', 'breakdown', 'just', 'shill', 'however', 'Harlan', 'Pyne', 'who', 'escaped', 'hospital', 'now', 'revenge', 'Samantha', 'hurting', 'closest', 'her.It', 'sound', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'good', 'thriller', 'crafted', 'well', 'usually', 'worth', 'watching', 'Fox', 'Everything', 'Gone', 'Green', 'screenwriter', 'Wil', 'Zmak', 'first', 'feature-length', 'assignment', 'though', 'are', 'something', 'more', 'frustrating', 'almost-but-not-quite', 'manage', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'enough', 'what', 'were', 'actually', 'made', 'movie', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'having', 'have', 'entirely', 'spelled', 'out', 'other', 'words', 'ending', 'works', 'better', 'Twohy', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Getaway', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'Singer', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'mostly', 'solid', 'acting', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Fox', 'where', 'put', 'camera', 'lights', 'get', 'atmosphere', 'scene', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'thriller', 'really', 'other', 'slightly', 'better-crafted', 'ending', 'one', 'been', 'much-overlooked', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'Pick', 'copy', 'up', 'help', 'rectify', 'earliest', 'convenience', '***']",The Dark Hours

Schultz,"[11, 12]","This is generally a worthwhile thriller, although for a little while I was afraid it was going to degenerate into just another repugnant case of sadistic home invasion. However the larger context rescues the film from that slush pile and advances it into some interesting psychological territory.Similarly, I was leery of the fact that the bonus materials on the DVD listed ""alternative endings."" Alternative endings usually signal to me that the people who made the movie had no semblance of a coherent artistic vision, but were only interested in gauging what would sell the most tickets. However it turned out that the alternates here aren't a testing of wildly different conclusions, but are varying extensions of the same basic conclusion. It was just a question of how far to elaborate the one idea. So there was no compromise of integrity, casting about here, there, and everywhere for the biggest fish.There are some lapses of logic along the way, and I'm not sure the surprises could stand close analysis.
