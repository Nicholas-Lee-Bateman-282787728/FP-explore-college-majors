It feels at times like a parody of a French film: characters talking directly to the camera, baring their feelings (typically, deeply introspective); depression and ennui; perennial art students who appear to be underemployed well into adulthood.However, writer/director S&eacute;bastien Betbeder ultimately triumphs: he keeps the length of this work to 'feels right' 91 minutes and delivers some likable characters.  Vincent Macaigne ('Arman') is an unlikely leading man, but he grows on you.  By the end of the film, you're rooting for him.",4,"In danger of parody, writer/director S&eacute;bastien Betbeder ultimately triumphs",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,678,"['saw', '2', 'Autumns', '3', 'Winters', 'part', 'excellent', 'Film', 'Movement', 'series', 'winning', 'little', 'film', 'times', 'parody', 'French', 'film', 'characters', 'talking', 'directly', 'camera', 'baring', 'feelings', 'typically', 'deeply', 'introspective', 'depression', 'ennui', 'perennial', 'art', 'students', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'underemployed', 'well', 'adulthood.However', 'writer/director', 'S', 'eacute', 'Betbeder', 'ultimately', 'length', 'work', ""'feels"", 'right', '91', 'minutes', 'delivers', 'likable', 'characters', 'Vincent', 'Macaigne', ""'Arman"", 'unlikely', 'leading', 'man', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'rooting']","2 Autumns, 3 Winters"
1694341,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00IK0UZKW,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 1]","This movie contains many things that have appeared in romances since the genre was first put down in print. Yet, it is completely unconventional in how the overall plot unwinds. Arman is 33 and understands that he needs to make a change in his life, starting with more concentration on fitness. While running in the park he has an accidental encounter with Am&eacute;lie and after the series of awkward apologies, Arman realizes that he wants to connect with her.With no other options available, Arman continues to run in the park in the hope of seeing Am&eacute;lie again, but that does not work. Yet, in another chance encounter that is dangerous, the two of them meet again in a manner where Arman is an injured hero. This is the second plot device that has been used many times before.At the same time these events are taking place, Arman's best friend Benjamin, who has never been sick a day in his life, suffers a stroke that leaves him face down on the ground and unable to move. Fortunately, the stroke leaves no permanent effects and Benjamin falls in love with his young and pretty physical therapist. This is the third plot device that has been used many times before.With the stage set for two pairs to interact both as couples as well as the dynamics inside the pairings, the movie breaks with the usual path of romances. While the couples struggle as they work out the parameters of their easing into a close relationship, it is more accurately described as quirky rather than typical of a romance. There are no wild bouts of yelling or anger when a major problem surfaces, while they get upset, they all seem to go with the flow. The ending is largely ambiguous; there is no real seemingly ""happy ever after"" resolution.One aspect of the movie that renders it even more unusual is that there are times when the actor is talking directly to the audience while all others in the vicinity are oblivious to the words. It is a distraction, especially in points of major tension, at times I found it broke the flow of the story rather than amplified it. There are moments when it takes a few seconds before you realize that the mode has changed and there is a mental hiccup as you recover.",4,A romance with no resolution and the talking to the audience is at times a distraction,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,2198,"['movie', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'appeared', 'romances', 'genre', 'was', 'first', 'put', 'down', 'print', 'completely', 'unconventional', 'how', 'overall', 'plot', 'unwinds', 'Arman', '33', 'understands', 'make', 'change', 'life', 'starting', 'more', 'concentration', 'fitness', 'running', 'park', 'accidental', 'encounter', 'Am', 'eacute', 'series', 'awkward', 'apologies', 'Arman', 'connect', 'her.With', 'other', 'options', 'available', 'Arman', 'run', 'park', 'hope', 'seeing', 'Am', 'eacute', 'again', 'not', 'work', 'chance', 'encounter', 'dangerous', 'two', 'meet', 'again', 'manner', 'where', 'Arman', 'injured', 'hero', 'second', 'plot', 'device', 'been', 'used', 'many', 'times', 'before.At', 'same', 'time', 'events', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'Arman', 'best', 'friend', 'Benjamin', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'sick', 'day', 'life', 'stroke', 'face', 'down', 'ground', 'unable', 'move', 'Fortunately', 'stroke', 'permanent', 'effects', 'Benjamin', 'love', 'young', 'pretty', 'physical', 'therapist', 'third', 'plot', 'device', 'been', 'used', 'many', 'times', 'before.With', 'stage', 'set', 'two', 'pairs', 'interact', 'couples', 'as', 'well', 'dynamics', 'pairings', 'movie', 'breaks', 'usual', 'path', 'romances', 'couples', 'struggle', 'work', 'out', 'parameters', 'easing', 'close', 'relationship', 'more', 'accurately', 'described', 'quirky', 'rather', 'typical', 'romance', 'are', 'wild', 'bouts', 'yelling', 'anger', 'when', 'major', 'problem', 'surfaces', 'get', 'upset', 'seem', 'go', 'flow', 'ending', 'largely', 'ambiguous', 'real', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'ever', 'resolution.One', 'aspect', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'unusual', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'actor', 'talking', 'directly', 'audience', 'others', 'vicinity', 'are', 'oblivious', 'words', 'distraction', 'especially', 'points', 'major', 'tension', 'times', 'found', 'broke', 'flow', 'story', 'rather', 'amplified', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'few', 'seconds', 'realize', 'mode', 'changed', 'mental', 'hiccup', 'recover']","2 Autumns, 3 Winters"
1694342,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00IK0UZKW,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","There is a French word that came to mind after the opening 10 minutes of this film - rasant. On the one hand the word means to get very close, as in brush past somebody. It is also from the base raser, or to shave. But the meaning I was looking for was a sort of boring, irritating, sort of like a close brush with somebody that has five o'clock shadow. I slogged through the rasant hour and twenty minutes, thinking this was one of the most not good movies I've seen recently. Then it happened, the film did something completely unexpected. In fact the film is a Mobius strip, and that changed everything.This is an annoying film. It has bits and pieces of the French New Wave cinema, especially Goddard. That could be amazing, instead the homage tried way too hard. The director threw in some Lelouch for good measure. It tried too hard to be intellectual. The film broke the fourth wall constantly. At times it was hard to tell if the person was speaking to the audience or to another character. A little bit of fourth wall goes a long way; this film overplayed its hand.The film centers around four people, how they are connected, and fall in and out of love. The story is told from the point of view of the three main characters, mostly focused on Arman. Unfortunately, Arman is not terribly pleasant to look at, he has dirty long hair with a receding hairline and a big bald spot, and he has a roughly seven day beard throughout the film (that takes a lot of work to look that scruffy all the time). Amelie and Benjamin are more attractive.The film is an hour and thirty one minutes long - roughly thirty minutes too long. The camera work is not particularly good. There is a strange tint to the film that makes it look like somebody applied an Instagram filter to the whole thing. The aspect ratio is strange - it is slightly wider than 4:3, so it is pillar letterboxed. This aspect ratio is somewhat annoying, although it is homage to the French New Wave - they shot mostly in that aspect ratio.The film is not rated. There is no nudity (oh actually there is a very brief moment of nudity from the back in a zombie clip), there is a little drug use, and some strong language appears in the subtitles. Just be aware that the 10 minute short film is most definitely rated R - don't stumble on that with a younger viewer in the room.If it wasn't for the end of the film (just be sure to pay attention to the hideous opening sequence, the Mobius concept will be apparent at the end), this would have been one of worst films I've seen in a long time. If you love French analysis of life and love, repeated over and over, this is a film you will be able to watch.I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. The 10 minute bonus short Business Trip is absolutely hilarious. It is sort of a dirty joke, and there is a picture of a naked woman shown several times. It is not for younger viewers. The stunning M&eacute;lanie Laurent is the hotel receptionist.I was provided a review copy.",3,Rasant,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,2983,"['French', 'word', 'came', 'mind', 'opening', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'rasant', 'one', 'hand', 'word', 'get', 'very', 'close', 'brush', 'somebody', 'also', 'base', 'raser', 'shave', 'meaning', 'was', 'looking', 'was', 'sort', 'boring', 'irritating', 'sort', 'close', 'brush', 'somebody', 'five', ""o'clock"", 'shadow', 'slogged', 'rasant', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'thinking', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'not', 'good', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'Then', 'happened', 'film', 'did', 'something', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'fact', 'film', 'Mobius', 'strip', 'changed', 'everything.This', 'annoying', 'film', 'bits', 'pieces', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'cinema', 'especially', 'Goddard', 'could', 'be', 'amazing', 'instead', 'homage', 'tried', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'director', 'threw', 'Lelouch', 'good', 'measure', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'intellectual', 'film', 'broke', 'fourth', 'wall', 'constantly', 'times', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'person', 'was', 'speaking', 'audience', 'character', 'little', 'bit', 'fourth', 'wall', 'long', 'way', 'film', 'overplayed', 'hand.The', 'film', 'centers', 'four', 'people', 'how', 'are', 'connected', 'fall', 'love', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'mostly', 'focused', 'Arman', 'Unfortunately', 'Arman', 'not', 'terribly', 'pleasant', 'look', 'dirty', 'long', 'hair', 'receding', 'hairline', 'big', 'bald', 'spot', 'roughly', 'seven', 'day', 'beard', 'film', 'lot', 'work', 'look', 'scruffy', 'time', 'Amelie', 'Benjamin', 'are', 'more', 'attractive.The', 'film', 'hour', 'thirty', 'one', 'minutes', 'long', 'roughly', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'strange', 'tint', 'film', 'look', 'somebody', 'applied', 'Instagram', 'filter', 'whole', 'thing', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'strange', 'slightly', 'wider', '4:3', 'pillar', 'letterboxed', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'homage', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'shot', 'mostly', 'aspect', 'ratio.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'nudity', 'oh', 'actually', 'very', 'brief', 'moment', 'nudity', 'back', 'zombie', 'clip', 'little', 'drug', 'use', 'strong', 'language', 'subtitles', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', '10', 'minute', 'short', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'rated', 'R', 'do', ""n't"", 'stumble', 'younger', 'viewer', 'room.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'end', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'sure', 'pay', 'attention', 'hideous', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Mobius', 'concept', 'will', 'be', 'apparent', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'worst', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'love', 'French', 'analysis', 'life', 'love', 'repeated', 'over', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'watch.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'long', 'time', '10', 'minute', 'bonus', 'short', 'Business', 'Trip', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'sort', 'dirty', 'joke', 'picture', 'naked', 'woman', 'shown', 'several', 'times', 'not', 'younger', 'viewers', 'stunning', 'M', 'eacute', 'Laurent', 'hotel', 'receptionist.I', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'copy']","2 Autumns, 3 Winters"
1694343,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00IK0UZKW,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","Affairs of the heart have that magical ability to crack through that wall of reason each of us erects in our minds for the purpose of making us feel all warm and fuzzy.  They do this using many techniques, many of which we don&#8217;t quite see coming clearly and, thus, are caught off-guard in the moment.  Generally, this produces the result of drawing us closer to those we&#8217;re watching.  Their moments are genuinely more heartfelt, and even their comic misadventures charm us into believing anything can happen.  However, when the artistic technique becomes more about &#8216;telling&#8217; the story than it is &#8216;showing&#8217; it to us, the system breaks down, and we sometimes see the end result for what it really is: a movie.There&#8217;s an audience for 2 AUTUMNS, 3 WINTERS, but it&#8217;s most likely not the same regular people who were drawn to THE NOTEBOOK.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;Arman is 33 and ready to make a change, starting with a run in the park.  When he literally bumps into Amelie &#8211; slightly cynical but nevertheless lovely &#8211; on the jogging path, he&#8217;s deadest on making a connection with her.  As a bit of contrived fate brings them together, Arman&#8217;s best friend Benjamin suffers an unexpected stroke, relegating him to the hospital for weeks where he falls for his doting young physical therapist.  Over the course of two autumns and three winters, Arman, Amelie, and Benjamin share the incidental moments, unexpected accidents, unconventional love stories and unforgettable memories that define who they are.&#8221;That synopsis of the film is fairly accurate, although it really is a bit dishonest to suggest that anyone&#8217;s fate is this picture is &#8216;contrived.&#8217;  True, there are moments that play out far more theatrical than they do literally, but isn&#8217;t that really part and parcel of what this whole thing called &#8216;life&#8217; is really about?  The lives of these people understandably intersect, and it&#8217;s the magic that results from all of those collisions &#8211; even that of two joggers &#8211; that gives much of this particular story a reason for us to watch it.But let&#8217;s not mix words: 2 AUTUMNS, 3 WINTERS is the kind of storytelling construct that&#8217;ll appeal far more to critics and art-house goers than it will the average Joe.  (Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that.)  The story is one involving love, the pursuit of love, and the acceptance of love (or a reasonable facsimile) by a handful of young(ish) nitwits (of sorts); and the narrative bounces back-and-forth between their various perspectives, cataloguing their personal observations of their successes and failures in what should&#8217;ve been more intriguing than what it was for me.In short, AUTUMNS allows characters to break through that wall between the character and the audience; several short dialogues are delivered Woody-Allen-esque right to you, the viewer.  A few of these are obvious &#8211; the character is set against a benign backdrop, and he (or she) is pouring out his thoughts or his heart in quirky or sublime fascination.  But others?  Several other attempts to convey some emotional impact are delivered actually while the character is already involved in a scene with others.  For example, there&#8217;s one section late in the film wherein Arman is riding in the back seat of a car; he splits time between speaking to the people in the front versus talking directly to the audience.  The problem with this?  Well, the way it was shot, I was never quite certain whether he was addressing me or them, so the trickery ended up being more confusing than it was effective.  This happens several times throughout the picture, and &#8211; as much as I&#8217;m sure writer/director Sebastien Betbeder thought it was a good idea &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t as convinced.It&#8217;s a good tale that delivers whatever reward you choose to take away from it &#8230; just as Arman realizes in his final scene of the picture.2 AUTUMNS, 3 WINTERS is produced by a whole host of French companies my version of Word will simply autocorrect into something inaccurate, so I encourage you to check them out at IMDB.com if you&#8217;re that interested.  DVD distribution is being handled by Film Movement.  For those of you needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a French-spoken-language release with English subtitles available.  (There is no English-dubbed track.)  As for the technical specifications?  Was it just me or was there an alarming amount of grain throughout many of the sequences?  I guess that &#8216;natural look&#8217; was intended to add to the earthly appeal of the picture, but I found it a bit too much especially given the fact that so many of them were edited up against sequences that were crisp and clear.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you&#8217;re interested in, then prepare for the worst: there aren&#8217;t any.  However, there is a short film for your enjoyment if you&#8217;re inclined.  (I wasn&#8217;t.)RECOMMENDED.  At times, I was more frustrated with 2 AUTUMNS, 3 WINTERS than I probably should&#8217;ve been.  This wasn&#8217;t because I didn&#8217;t like the characters or the various stories working dependently and independently with one another; rather it was due to a curiously distracting narrative technique that allowed most of these people to speak directly to me (the audience) while they were already engaged in a scene within the movie.  On occasion, it became difficult to discern whether they were speaking to me or to one another.  Honestly, I would rather they have spoken to one another as what they had to say to me wasn&#8217;t all that interesting.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Film Movement provided me with a DVD copy of 2 AUTUMNS, 3 WINTERS by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",4,"The Lives Seem Real, But The Storytelling Device Was An Obvious Storytelling Device",1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,6423,"['Affairs', 'heart', 'have', 'magical', 'ability',

1694344,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00IK0UZKW,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Writer/director S&eacute;bastien Betbeder Feels more like a film and a story - if that makes sense. It is the type of film you need to be in the mood to see - a rather extended, and at times tedious, conversation between actors and camera that works for a while and then becomes a distraction. But as with the French, even when bouquet isn't entirely fresh it still has charm.As fate would have it the bored and distracted early thirties Arman (Vincent Macaigne) inadvertently bumps into Am&eacute;lie (Maud Wyler) - pretty but not exactly pleased with her life or life in general - while taking a healthy jog in the park. Up pops a problem: Arman's best friend Benjamin (Bastien Bouillon) has a cerebrovascular accident and is hospitalized, impaired but still with eyes for his physical therapist.  The stage is then set for an ongoing exchange of life stories, accidents, memories (good and bad) among the three main characters.

Arman is 33 and drifting aimlessly.  Amelie is 27, driven and more than a little cynical.  After their meeting their lives seem to twist and turn, eventually leading to another meeting and a relationship.  Tied in with the main story are other characters, including Arman's friend Benjamin and his own  love interest.  In an American romantic comedy that would have been pretty much it, but there are some deeper levels here.The story plays out from 2009 to early 2012. In stereotypical French film fashion the characters indulge in a great deal of introspection, speaking directly to the camera about their perceptions. I'm not fluent in French and had to rely on the subtitles, so some of the subtleties and ironies were undoubtedly lost on me, however I did find the characters appealing and the story interesting.

He contrives to run into her again and eventually does. Arman's best friend Benjamin suffers a stroke and while recuperating, makes a connection with his physical therapist.Those are the players. And the rest of the film is a series of vignettes and ruminations from the characters on life, love, moments and memories.Some of the film is shot so it appears as though a hand held camera was used. I dislike this style - I find the movement jarring and hard to watch.  The addition of labelled chapters also added to the 'homemade' feel.In much of the film, the actors are speaking directly to the viewer. (And sometimes when they are in a scene with another actor) Although you would think this would provide an intimate relationship between actor and viewer, for me it didn't. Initially I was interested in the four, learning of their lives and wondering what would happen over the course of the film. But as the film progressed,  I found myself becoming tired and frankly somewhat bored with the almost repetitiveness of their ruminations.From the director: &#34;I wanted the narrative to be dense, to alternate between serious, critical moments in the lives of these young people, and more incidental moments that have no real impact. I wanted to talk about death and shopping at the grocery store, about love and reality TV.&#34;Initially I connected with the main character Arman (Vincent Macaigne). His attempts to meet Amelie (Maud Wyler) were engaging. And I liked him at the end of the film. But in between, he seemed to almost overact. And I know this is petty, but I found myself tuning out and instead his hair became my focus, instead of his lines. He's always flipping it back, it's dirty and greasy and growing it long and doing a comb over does not hide the large bald spot at the back.There are many film references that will be noted by avid film buffs. Through my own lacking, I was unable to appreciate many of these homages.2 Autumns, 3 Winters was just too 'arty' for this viewer.

1694348,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00IK0UZKW,Paul Allaer,"[1, 1]","""2 Autumns, 3 Winters"" (2013 release from France; 91 min.) brings the story of Arman (played by Vincent Macaigne), a 30-something man who is drifting through life, unsure of what he will do. Then one day, while jogging in the park, he (literally) bumps into Amelie (played by Maud Wyler), who's in her late 20s and in a less than great relationship. After an awkward exchange, Arman is sure that ""she's the one"" and tries to run into her again, but to no avail. In a parallel story line, we get to know Benjamin (played by Bastien Bouillon), a longtime friend of Arman. One day, Benjamin suffers a stroke and during his recovery he gets to know Katia (played by Audrey Bastien), his speech therapist. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is a conversation-driven relationship movie, in which there's (in case there was any doubt) lots of talking. Yet it is done in a slightly off-center manner. The main characters talk to each other and also into the camera on-and-off, as if to provide commentary to their own lives. Second, the movie is divided into two parts, with each having about 20 'subchapters', many of which last barely a minute. Third, there are a couple of nice music references in the movie. It had been years, decades really, that I had been reminded of Michel Delpech, the French singer who had great success in the 1970s. And then there is the placement of Fleet Foxes' ""Tiger Mountain Peasant Song"", from their stellar debut album some years ago. What a gorgeous (and romantic) song that still is. Last but not least, in this type of movie, you had better have engaging acting performances, and on that level the movie certain delivers. I was not familiar with any of the lead actors, but they delivered a nice ensemble performance. In all, this feels like a quirky little movie, which I quite enjoyed for what it was, and it flew by in no time.This movie was the January, 2014 release in the on-going series of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club of foreign and indie movies, and it will be released to the public at large in June, 2014. As usual, the DVD comes with a number of bonus materials, including a nice shortie, ""Voyage d'Affaires"" (""Business Trip"", 2013 release from France; 11 min.), also worth checking out.",4,Quirky relationship indie from France,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,2348,"['2', 'Autumns', '3', 'Winters', '2013', 'release', 'France', '91', 'min', 'story', 'Arman', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Macaigne', '30-something', 'man', 'who', 'drifting', 'life', 'unsure', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'jogging', 'park', 'literally', 'Amelie', 'played', 'Maud', 'Wyler', 'who', 'late', '20s', 'less', 'great', 'relationship', 'awkward', 'exchange', 'Arman', 'sure', 'one', 'run', 'again', 'avail', 'parallel', 'story', 'line', 'get', 'know', 'Benjamin', 'played', 'Bastien', 'Bouillon', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Arman', 'One', 'day', 'Benjamin', 'stroke', 'recovery', 'know', 'Katia', 'played', 'Audrey', 'Bastien', 'speech', 'therapist', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'conversation-driven', 'relationship', 'movie', 'case', 'was', 'doubt', 'lots', 'talking', 'done', 'slightly', 'off-center', 'manner', 'main', 'characters', 'talk', 'other', 'also', 'camera', 'on-and-off', 'provide', 'commentary', 'own', 'lives', 'Second', 'movie', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'having', '20', ""'subchapters"", 'many', 'last', 'barely', 'minute', 'Third', 'are', 'couple', 'nice', 'music', 'references', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'years', 'decades', 'really', 'had', 'been', 'reminded', 'Michel', 'Delpech', 'French', 'singer', 'who', 'had', 'great', 'success', '1970s', 'then', 'placement', 'Fleet', 'Foxes', 'Tiger', 'Mountain', 'Peasant', 'Song', 'stellar', 'debut', 'years', 'ago', 'What', 'gorgeous', 'romantic', 'song', 'still', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'type', 'movie', 'had', 'better', 'have', 'engaging', 'acting', 'performances', 'movie', 'certain', 'delivers', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'lead', 'actors', 'delivered', 'nice', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'feels', 'quirky', 'little', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'flew', 'time.This', 'movie', 'was', 'January', '2014', 'release', 'on-going', 'series', 'Film', 'Movement', 'DVD-of-the-Month', 'Club', 'foreign', 'indie', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'public', 'large', 'June', '2014', 'usual', 'DVD', 'number', 'bonus', 'materials', 'including', 'nice', 'shortie', 'Voyage', ""d'Affaires"", 'Business', 'Trip', '2013', 'release', 'France', '11', 'min', 'also', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']","2 Autumns, 3 Winters"
1694349,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00IK0UZKW,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 2]","This has been called `quirky' which is normally a cop-out phrase for not quite being able to categorise a film. I think highly original would be a lot better. We meet Arman - Vincent Macaigne- who hits 33 with a bang and so decides to start taking life seriously which will include packing up the Gauloises and going jogging in the park. Whilst doing the running he runs into Amelie (Maud Wyler - `Blue is the warmest colour') and he knows that something special will happen. He also has a best mate in Benjamin played by the really nice Bastien Bouillon who suffers a stroke at the age of thirty.What happens then is we are taken on a linear but sometimes quite random series of events from 2009 to 2012. There is a lot of addressing direct to the camera and often this is done to explain both sides of a situation. The film is told in chapters too which helps to show the significance of each segment. Director Sebastien Betbeder uses these techniques as a way to develop more intimacy with the viewer and the characters and I have to say it works beautifully. I was hooked by about seven minutes in and wanted to know more about all the characters. I particularly liked the way all the actors are relatively unknown and Vincent Macaigne has a Gerrard Depardieu screen presence that made him immediately engaging.  Bastien Bouillon is effortlessly good looking and so extremely nice that you just want to take him out for a pint (that would probably be half a litre being Paris I suppose). Maud Wyler is both asserting and vulnerable and comes across as totally convincing despite some challenging twists in the story.This was made up from real life experiences of Sebastien Betbeder and it is clear a lot of love has gone into it. It also features a cracking sound track that one you could easily miss as the narrative carries you along- look out for `Le Chasseur' by Michel Delpeche - I had never heard of him so downloaded the track straight away - c'est magnifique! You can probably tell by now that I completely loved this film. Yes it is quirky, it is funny in places, it is about real lives told simply and is one of those films that will stay with you for a while after seeing it - in a very good way. I got this from Film Movement as a review piece and it also contains a short film by the same director - `Voyages D'Affaires'.
