1428618,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B004UVYQYQ,a,"[0, 0]","First of all, ""Kill The Irishman"" boasts a very impressive cast with excellent performances from Ray Stevenson, Val Kilmer, and Vincent D'Onofrio in the lead roles and supporting performances--in some cases, extended cameos--from Christopher Walken, Fionnula Flanagan, Paul Sorvino, and seemingly half the cast of ""The Sopranos.""  Certainly I would have liked to have seen more of Walken and Sorvino, whose screen time is extremely limited, but considering how much action and drama is crammed into a fairly brisk 100-minute running time, I am still happy with what we have here.The story of Danny Greene and his battle with the Italian mafia in Cleveland is tense, exciting, and realistically portrayed.  Certain dramatic liberties were taken, it appears, yet for the most part, the film seems to largely stick to the real-life facts.  Stevenson is at his best here, deserving of at least an Oscar nomination, as the violent yet strangely likeable Irish thug.  My only negative comment is that some of the CGI car explosions, particularly the dark smoke clouds, look a little fake, but they do not really take away from the story.It is definitely worth noting that the DVD offers one special feature: an hour-long professionally-produced documentary on the real-life characters involved in the story.  Slick and engaging, this program features a number of interesting interviews and a variety of rare photographs and news footage.  While I would have also enjoyed some features on the making of the film, or at the very least on the casting process, this is a fine and substantial special feature that added to my enjoyment of the film.

1428619,A3U0S17XYK8XMJ,B004UVYQYQ,Alexander Lucard,"[1, 4]","With a cast like Ray Stevenson, Christopher Walken and Val Kilmer, you might automatically assume that ""Kill the Irishman"" is a top notch flick, but you'd be wrong. The script is a bit plodding, the acting by a good deal of the cast can be weak and it's hard to find anyone to root for in the film. Do you remember the antihero films of the 60s and 70s? This is a bit like those. That doesn't mean that the movie is bad, just that about fifteen to twenty minutes could have been cut from it to make it a tighter, more seamless film. As it stands, the film feels cluttered with padding in the same way films used to have stock footage back in the day.Kill the Irishman does come with a documentary on the real Danny Greene that is an hour long and I actually preferred that to the fictionalized movie on his life. For me, it's not a good sign when a special feature overshadows the actual film, but this is one of those cases.  Personally, if you are interested in Danny Greene and the fall of the Cleveland Mafia, Rick Porello's book by the same name is a better investment of your time and money.",3,"Great Cast, Poor script",1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,1097,"['cast', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'might', 'automatically', 'assume', 'Kill', 'Irishman', 'top', 'notch', 'flick', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'script', 'bit', 'plodding', 'acting', 'good', 'deal', 'cast', 'can', 'be', 'weak', 'hard', 'find', 'anyone', 'root', 'film', 'Do', 'remember', 'antihero', 'films', '60s', '70s', 'bit', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'bad', 'just', 'about', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'make', 'tighter', 'more', 'seamless', 'film', 'film', 'feels', 'cluttered', 'padding', 'same', 'way', 'films', 'used', 'have', 'stock', 'footage', 'back', 'day.Kill', 'Irishman', 'come', 'documentary', 'real', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'hour', 'long', 'actually', 'preferred', 'fictionalized', 'movie', 'life', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'special', 'feature', 'actual', 'film', 'one', 'cases', 'Personally', 'are', 'interested', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'fall', 'Cleveland', 'Mafia', 'Rick', 'Porello', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'better', 'investment', 'time', 'money']",N/A

Full of action and drama with characters that really spoke to you about what they believe in and are fighting for. For me this was not your typical gangster film for it was not all about killing and getting revenge on others but more about getting what should be rightfully yours.Danny Greene might not have completed high school but that doesn't mean he is not educated. He reads the newspaper and congress letters to better himself and his people have a better life. He does make wrong choices but for the right reasons. He was a very likeable character and funny to watch his Tv cameos with the reporters. How many people can walk away without getting hurt when someone has tried to blow up your home, your car, and shot you more than 4 times? Danny Greene can!The supporting cast including Christopher Walken & Val Kilmer help provide the icing on the cake for me in this film! They were wonderful characters, and Val Kilmer narrating was a nice touch to the story and a different perceptive for he plays the detective for Cleveland PD.When it was all said and done it left me with a feeling of sadness for the mafia would never be the same without Danny Greene and if they would have just let him go to that cattle ranch maybe things would have been different.  But as it turns out things would never be the same for the mafia in Cleveland and you can thank the people who didn't see Danny Greene's way.On another note, I don't remember seeing this film hit theaters. Did I miss it somewhere? I really enjoyed this film and would have loved to see it on the big screen. With so many BOOMS and so many laughs I have to recommend this film even if your not too much into gangsta films for this is not your typical film.",5,Boom from start to finish!,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,1831,"['Great', 'movie', 'start', 'stop', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'start', 'off', 'bang', 'ended', 'even', 'bigger', 'bang', 'Full', 'action', 'drama', 'characters', 'really', 'spoke', 'what', 'believe', 'are', 'fighting', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'gangster', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'killing', 'getting', 'revenge', 'others', 'more', 'getting', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'rightfully', 'yours.Danny', 'Greene', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'completed', 'high', 'school', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'educated', 'newspaper', 'congress', 'letters', 'better', 'people', 'have', 'better', 'life', 'make', 'wrong', 'choices', 'right', 'reasons', 'was', 'very', 'likeable', 'character', 'funny', 'watch', 'Tv', 'cameos', 'reporters', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'getting', 'hurt', 'when', 'someone', 'tried', 'blow', 'up', 'home', 'car', 'shot', 'more', '4', 'times', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'can', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'help', 'provide', 'icing', 'cake', 'film', 'were', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'narrating', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'story', 'different', 'perceptive', 'detective', 'Cleveland', 'PD.When', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'left', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'mafia', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'maybe', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'out', 'things', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'mafia', 'Cleveland', 'can', 'thank', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'way.On', 'note', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'hit', 'theaters', 'Did', 'miss', 'somewhere', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'so', 'many', 'BOOMS', 'so', 'many', 'laughs', 'have', 'recommend', 'film', 'even', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'gangsta', 'films', 'not', 'typical', 'film']",N/A

Greene is driving down the road in his car, pops a cassette tape into his dashboard player, and notices that the tape pops and hisses, sending out a small shower of sparks. With scant microseconds to spare, Greene rolls out of the moving vehicle as it explodes into a mass of flames.  Maybe I'm too easily entertained, but this grabbed my attention.The rest of this true crime movie deals with Greene's rise from a hardscrabble Irish childhood in working class Cleveland (where he was regularly set upon and beaten by the local Sicilian kids, resulting in a lifelong hatred of Italians), to disgruntled dockworker, to corrupt union boss, to leg-breaker for a loan shark (played by Christopher Walken), to mobster and local hero in his Collinwood neighborhood. Oh, and along the way, he becomes an informant for the FBI. This guy was playing everybody in Cleveland and doing a fine job of it.  After the financing for a business deal goes sour, Greene has a falling out with the local Mafia thugs, and the car bombings begin.  Bodies are being blown to bits all over town, but Danny Greene is proving harder to kill than Rasputin.This is a great story, ably told and well acted (I especially liked Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal of John Nardi), and an entertaining way to pass a rainy (or sweltering) afternoon.  There's a documentary on the life of Danny Greene in the bonus features that is every bit as interesting as the movie.

1428629,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B004UVYQYQ,CGScammell,"[0, 0]","I am not usually into movies about violence, gangsters, etc, but the starring cast had me intrigued.  I didn't know anything about the Cleveland ganster scene, and chose this movie for that purpose.  I was not disappointed, especially watching this movie on a large TV hooked up to surround sound.  My living room sounded like a war zone during this movie.  This movie is ""based on true events"" so I can't vouch for what in this movie is factual and what was Hollywoodified, although I'm prone to say there is a lot of truth in this movie based on a few short documentaries I watched on YouTube after seeing this movie.Ray Stevenson portrays Irishman Danny Greene, who, together with a Cleveland detective both grew up in east Cleveland, Collinswood, and were school mates together.  Greene excelled in sports and developed a mean punch fighting others, and it was with his fists that he started fighting others.  Fire arms came later in the movie, and the first time he killed with a gun it was in self defense.I felt the characters were all well-acted, especially Stevenson's character.  He respects women and does have a heart for justice.  Fighthing for the underdog, he's elected president of the Longshoremen Union on Lake Erie.  It is this position that gets him thrust fighting the Italian mob that control  shipping unions across the country.  This former classmate, played by Val Kilmer, also has a heart for Greene although they are on opposite ends of the law.  Although never close friends, they respect each other, and it is the detective who pays Greene a short visit over a few shots of whiskey to warn Greene that there's a man out there wanting to kill him, and gives him the man's name.  Greene has noticed this strange man, too, watching him from his old van while he does his morning work-out in a nearby park. This skewed relationship is what I enjoyed the most about this otherwise fast-paced and ""explosive"" movie that could easily have run a good half-hour longer for more in-depth character development.  Greene's villains are merely that:  villains.  So much behind-the-scenes development was left out of this story.All the props, from hair styles, music, clothes and cars were realistic.  The 1970s were the abyss for American cities before the 1990s revived most of them, so it was no surprise to discover in the end that this movie was filmed mostly in downtown Detroit.I liked this movie and watched it twice for this review.  My biggest complaint is that it lacks character development, but the story behind mobster Greene and the Cleveland detective gives this movie enough oomph to merit five stars, due to Greene's underlying sensitive character.  Most mobsters are depicted as evil, blood-thirsty and misogynistic.  Although Greene did kill off quite a few men in his lifetime, this movie portrays him as a man who really didn't have a choice.4+",5,Great enjoyment,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,2881,"['am', 'not', 'usually', 'movies', 'violence', 'gangsters', 'etc', 'starring', 'cast', 'had', 'intrigued', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Cleveland', 'ganster', 'scene', 'chose', 'movie', 'purpose', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'especially', 'watching', 'movie', 'large', 'TV', 'hooked', 'up', 'surround', 'sound', 'living', 'room', 'sounded', 'war', 'zone', 'movie', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'vouch', 'what', 'movie', 'factual', 'what', 'was', 'Hollywoodified', ""'m"", 'prone', 'say', 'lot', 'truth', 'movie', 'based', 'few', 'short', 'documentaries', 'watched', 'YouTube', 'seeing', 'movie.Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Irishman', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'who', 'together', 'Cleveland', 'detective', 'both', 'grew', 'up', 'east', 'Cleveland', 'Collinswood', 'were', 'school', 'mates', 'together', 'Greene', 'excelled', 'sports', 'developed', 'mean', 'punch', 'fighting', 'others', 'was', 'fists', 'started', 'fighting', 'others', 'Fire', 'arms', 'came', 'later', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'killed', 'gun', 'was', 'self', 'defense.I', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', 'well-acted', 'especially', 'Stevenson', 'character', 'women', 'have', 'heart', 'justice', 'Fighthing', 'underdog', 'elected', 'president', 'Longshoremen', 'Union', 'Lake', 'Erie', 'position', 'thrust', 'fighting', 'Italian', 'mob', 'control', 'shipping', 'unions', 'country', 'former', 'classmate', 'played', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'also', 'heart', 'Greene', 'are', 'opposite', 'ends', 'law', 'never', 'close', 'friends', 'respect', 'other', 'detective', 'who', 'Greene', 'short', 'visit', 'few', 'shots', 'whiskey', 'warn', 'Greene', 'man', 'there', 'wanting', 'kill', 'man', 'name', 'Greene', 'noticed', 'strange', 'man', 'too', 'watching', 'old', 'van', 'morning', 'work-out', 'nearby', 'park', 'skewed', 'relationship', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'otherwise', 'fast-paced', 'explosive', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'run', 'good', 'half-hour', 'longer', 'more', 'in-depth', 'character', 'development', 'Greene', 'villains', 'are', 'merely', 'villains', 'So', 'much', 'behind-the-scenes', 'development', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'props', 'hair', 'styles', 'music', 'clothes', 'cars', 'were', 'realistic', '1970s', 'were', 'abyss', 'American', 'cities', '1990s', 'revived', 'most', 'was', 'surprise', 'discover', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'mostly', 'downtown', 'Detroit.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'watched', 'twice', 'review', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'mobster', 'Greene', 'Cleveland', 'detective', 'movie', 'enough', 'oomph', 'merit', 'five', 'stars', 'due', 'Greene', 'underlying', 'sensitive', 'character', 'Most', 'mobsters', 'are', 'depicted', 'evil', 'blood-thirsty', 'misogynistic', 'Greene', 'did', 'kill', 'off', 'few', 'men', 'lifetime', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice.4+']",N/A

I think I'll take the mafia any day.  If you didn't mess with them they left you alone.  The gangs today think it's fun to kill people just for the ""thrill"". You are not safe anywhere, so would Danny be proud that his death brought down the mafia all over the country and now we live with gangs running rampant?

To climb to that level, he stands upright against the entrenched mobsters of Cleveland.  He becomes successful by staying alive while killing his enemies.  The film portrays Greene as a ""goodfella"" but also reveals his violence that inspires 36 bombings in a spree of attacks against another mob leader.Like good gangster movies, this one shows the main character as a paradox of virtues and violence.  Eventually he becomes the victim of his own pattern of killings.What we see in the film focuses mainly on his violent ""business"" tactics that in essence are quite evil, as he kills and beats up dozens of men.  His own lovely wife and kids leave him, as the violence escalates.  They are never seen or heard from again.  This too reveals the true character of the man.As this story is based on the real story of Danny Greene, the movie intersperses real news accounts of the time reporting on bombings, arrests and events of Danny Greene.  This definitely adds to the realism of the film.The acting is well done.  The main character comes across as realistic.  Several of the names and faces are recognizable, especially Kilmer and Walken.  The detective Kilmer plays narrates the film, so it provides plot information but lacks the intimacy of Goodfellas in which one of the mobsters tells the story.  The narrative is somewhat sympathetic toward Greene but in no way lets him off the hook for his violence.I have to say that Walken's acting was reminiscent of his appearances on Sat Night Live when you could tell he was reading the lines directly out of the camera's view.This is an entertaining and informative movie that does not offer gratuitous or graphic violence but definitely shows the reality of a violent existence.",4,A Good Biographical Gangster Film,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,1896,"['Kill', 'Irishman', 'real', 'story', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'Irishman', 'Cleveland', 'OH', 'who', 'ranks', 'longshoreman', 'union', 'leader', 'then', 'mob', 'leader', 'climb', 'level', 'upright', 'entrenched', 'mobsters', 'Cleveland', 'successful', 'staying', 'alive', 'killing', 'enemies', 'film', 'Greene', 'goodfella', 'also', 'violence', '36', 'bombings', 'spree', 'attacks', 'mob', 'leader.Like', 'good', 'gangster', 'movies', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'paradox', 'virtues', 'violence', 'Eventually', 'victim', 'own', 'pattern', 'killings.What', 'see', 'film', 'mainly', 'violent', 'business', 'tactics', 'essence', 'are', 'quite', 'evil', 'up', 'dozens', 'men', 'own', 'lovely', 'wife', 'kids', 'leave', 'violence', 'escalates', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'again', 'too', 'true', 'character', 'man.As', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'story', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'movie', 'real', 'news', 'accounts', 'time', 'reporting', 'bombings', 'arrests', 'events', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'definitely', 'realism', 'film.The', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'main', 'character', 'realistic', 'Several', 'names', 'are', 'recognizable', 'especially', 'Kilmer', 'Walken', 'detective', 'Kilmer', 'film', 'plot', 'information', 'intimacy', 'Goodfellas', 'one', 'mobsters', 'tells', 'story', 'narrative', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'Greene', 'way', 'off', 'hook', 'violence.I', 'have', 'say', 'Walken', 'acting', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'appearances', 'Sat', 'Night', 'Live', 'when', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'reading', 'lines', 'directly', 'camera', 'view.This', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'movie', 'not', 'offer', 'gratuitous', 'graphic', 'violence', 'definitely', 'reality', 'violent', 'existence']",N/A

After such a dramatic opening, Kill The Irishman restarts the story of Danny Greene (played by Ray Stevenson) from his childhood days. Danny was raised by his grandfather, and grew up spending less time studying than fighting -- and when he fought, it was often with a large group of Sicilian boys who ganged up on him and another Irish boy, Joe Manditski (played by Val Kilmer).Manditski grew up to be a police detective in the Cleveland PD, and his character's narration of this film provides fascinating insights into the twists and turns of Danny Greene's life as he ascends from dockworker to president of the longshoreman union, to gangster, and FBI informant.Danny Greene's life was complex, yet this film focuses on the story of how he stood up to and posthumously triumphed over the Italian mafia in America. Whereas most gangsters in the 1970s acknowledged traditional ways of showing respect to the hierarchy of mafia families, Greene's audacious lack of respect for existing criminal organizations instantly made him a marked man. Ray Stevenson's portrayal of Greene is multidimensional, showing both a tender-hearted compassion toward friends and family, and cold-blooded ruthlessness toward those he considered in his way.Some of the aspects of Danny Greene's life merely hinted at rather than explored in depth in this film included what and who inspired him to pursue a lifelong passion for self-improvement in body, mind, and spirit. Scenes of Danny taking daily jogs, doing sit-ups, reading books, and studying his Celtic roots don't fully explain what motivated him to become known as the ""Robin Hood of Collinwood,"" giving money and food to those in need, nor what drove him to be so well-informed when he spent so little time studying or even attending class as a school boy.This DVD includes a fabulous hour-long documentary on Danny Greene and the Cleveland Car Bomb War of 1976, featuring interviews with Danny Greene's ex-wife, daughter, a mob attorney, and many others who survived that historic and horrific period in history.Kill the Irishman is highly recommended to anyone interested in the mafia, history of Cleveland, gangsters, and crime in America.",5,How One Gangster Brought Down America's Mob,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,2439,"['gritty', 'true', 'story', 'Cleveland', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'day', 'immediately', 'grabbed', 'full', 'attention', 'larger-than-life', 'character', 'leaps', 'exploding', 'car', 'taunt', 'would-be', 'killers', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'dramatic', 'opening', 'Kill', 'Irishman', 'story', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'played', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'childhood', 'days', 'Danny', 'was', 'raised', 'grandfather', 'grew', 'up', 'spending', 'less', 'time', 'studying', 'fighting', 'when', 'fought', 'was', 'often', 'large', 'group', 'Sicilian', 'boys', 'who', 'ganged', 'up', 'Irish', 'boy', 'Joe', 'Manditski', 'played', 'Val', 'Kilmer', '.Manditski', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'police', 'detective', 'Cleveland', 'PD', 'character', 'narration', 'film', 'fascinating', 'insights', 'twists', 'turns', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'life', 'dockworker', 'president', 'longshoreman', 'union', 'gangster', 'FBI', 'informant.Danny', 'Greene', 'life', 'was', 'complex', 'yet', 'film', 'story', 'how', 'stood', 'up', 'posthumously', 'triumphed', 'Italian', 'mafia', 'America', 'Whereas', 'most', 'gangsters', '1970s', 'acknowledged', 'traditional', 'ways', 'showing', 'respect', 'hierarchy', 'mafia', 'families', 'Greene', 'audacious', 'lack', 'respect', 'existing', 'criminal', 'organizations', 'instantly', 'made', 'marked', 'man', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'portrayal', 'Greene', 'multidimensional', 'showing', 'tender-hearted', 'compassion', 'friends', 'family', 'cold-blooded', 'ruthlessness', 'considered', 'way.Some', 'aspects', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'life', 'merely', 'hinted', 'rather', 'explored', 'depth', 'film', 'included', 'what', 'who', 'inspired', 'pursue', 'lifelong', 'passion', 'self-improvement', 'body', 'mind', 'spirit', 'Scenes', 'Danny', 'taking', 'daily', 'jogs', 'doing', 'sit-ups', 'reading', 'books', 'studying', 'Celtic', 'roots', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'explain', 'what', 'motivated', 'become', 'known', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Collinwood', 'giving', 'money', 'food', 'need', 'what', 'drove', 'be', 'so', 'well-informed', 'when', 'spent', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'studying', 'even', 'attending', 'class', 'school', 'boy.This', 'DVD', 'fabulous', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'Cleveland', 'Car', 'Bomb', 'War', '1976', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'ex-wife', 'daughter', 'mob', 'attorney', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'survived', 'historic', 'horrific', 'period', 'history.Kill', 'Irishman', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'mafia', 'history', 'Cleveland', 'gangsters', 'crime', 'America']",N/A

That's more of a failure of the distributor or the marketing department than anything inherent in the film.  This is a great movie!  It's obvious antecedent is Martin Scorsese's masterwork, ""Goodfellas"", but director Jonathan Hensleigh adds his own individual fluorishes that would excuse him from plagarism.  This film is crisply edited and the story is riveting. I love the way Hensleigh incorporates vintage newsreel footage into the narrative.  Hensleigh has assembled a top-notch cast in support of what should be a star-making turn by Ray Stevenson.  Stevenson's Danny Greene is as complex a character as you'll find in any film, an ambitious yet ultimately self-destructive powder keg of a man who somehow manages to squirm out of a series of predicaments of his own device.

1428642,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B004UVYQYQ,David Girod,"[1, 3]","""Kill the Irishman"" presents the story of Danny Greene and his rise through the mob, his uncanny ability to survive the multiple attempts on his life by his Italian counterparts.I really liked the idea behind the film, and hoped to see it fleshed out in typical ""Goodfellas"" style. Unfortunately it just never quite reaches that level, and while entertaining, ""Kill the Irishman"" never differentiates itself from so many others in the genre. There are several elements introduced that I would have liked the film makers to explore further. The relationship between Danny and his wife, I would have liked to see more time spent on the Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken characters. As it played out, both were little more than extended cameos. I think the best part of the film was the relationship between Danny Greene and John Nardi (played by Vincent D'Onofrio).One jarring aspect that really hurt the overall film was the execution of the car bombings. Because they are so important to the overall story, it's pretty obvious when fake CGI explosions occur. This pulls the viewer right out of the story and give the whole film a bad B-Movie feel.I don't think I would recommend a purchase, but it's definately worth adding to your Netflix queue or checking out when it hits cable.",3,Solid Movie That Could Have Been Much Better,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,1281,"['Kill', 'Irishman', 'story', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'rise', 'mob', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'survive', 'multiple', 'attempts', 'life', 'Italian', 'counterparts.I', 'really', 'liked', 'idea', 'film', 'hoped', 'see', 'fleshed', 'out', 'typical', 'Goodfellas', 'style', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'never', 'quite', 'level', 'entertaining', 'Kill', 'Irishman', 'never', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'genre', 'are', 'several', 'elements', 'introduced', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'makers', 'explore', 'further', 'relationship', 'Danny', 'wife', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'characters', 'played', 'out', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'extended', 'cameos', 'think', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'relationship', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'John', 'Nardi', 'played', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", '.One', 'jarring', 'aspect', 'really', 'overall', 'film', 'was', 'execution', 'car', 'bombings', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'overall', 'story', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'when', 'fake', 'CGI', 'explosions', 'occur', 'viewer', 'right', 'story', 'give', 'whole', 'film', 'bad', 'B-Movie', 'feel.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'definately', 'worth', 'adding', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'checking', 'out', 'when', 'cable']",N/A
1428643,A3R9HPWFF9QWSN,B004UVYQYQ,"David Keymer ""David Keymer""","[0, 0]","When first released to the movie theaters, Kill the Irishman received mixed reviews, ranging from so-so to pretty good. I grew up in Cleveland but I'd left a decade before the 1976 gang wars detailed in the movie. Still, I remember reading in the late fifties and early sixties about the Jewish fixer, Shondor Birns  (played by Christopher Walken in the movie), who was frequently in the news, often in pieces about the nightlife downtown. I worked one summer on the waterfront, as an ordinary seaman on an ore boat, and of course I had to join the union, but I knew nothing about the hard life of union longshoremen depicted in the movie.The movie is relatively faithful in depicting what happened in the mid-1970s in Cleveland, when renegade Irishman Danny Greene (played as a brooding Irish giant by Ray Stephenson in a signature portrayal) almost singlehandedly took on the Italian mob and though he didn't win, came close enough to winning to scare the bejaysus out of them. Danny's death by car bomb was the last in a long string of bombings that for a while made Cleveland the car bombing capital of the civilized world.  Where there are deviations from the historical record they are small and done for artistic effect, either to simplify the narrative chain or to focus attention on the principals in the complicated Dance of Death between Danny and the Cleveland branch of the Cosa Nostra.  ""They haven't built a bomb yet big enough to kill Danny Greene,"" Danny boasts on television (they show the original television footage in the movie) but he was wrong.  This violent movie about violent people in violent times doesn't sugarcoat all the bad things that took place then, nor does it make saints out of its thugs.Even Danny! Compared to the hoods who circled round him, Danny Greene was almost a saint, though of a particularly perverse type. In the movie, as in life, he takes care of the problems in his neighborhood, pays the rent for an indigent Irish widow who lives next to him, delivers hams and turkeys to needy families on the holidays. He even coaches a Little League team!At one point early in the movie, Danny is charged with wiping out his sometime friend, garbage collector Mike Frato (Steve Schirripa, from The Sopranos): Frato has refused to join the garbage collectors' union Danny is organizing for the Italian mob. Danny hesitates. It's not just that he likes Frato but Frato has ten kids. ""You said you wanted to be in the bigs,"" another hood counsels him. ""Sometimes you gotta do things you don't like."" Now that's an understatement! But it's also the sign for what happens soon after in the movie: once started, the violence just doesn't end. Lots of people die in this movie.There are some zingers in Irishman. I like especially this line, delivered by Danny's partner mob underboss John Nardi (played exceptionally well by veteran actor Vincent D'Onofrio, best known for the role of Det. Robert Goren on Law and Order: Criminal Intent)). Nardi and Greene are trying to convince the mob moneymen in New York to invest millions in a rundown Texas cattle ranch. Once they own it they will divert cattle sales to mob-controlled cattle yards up north and everyone will profit from the skim. In his final push to convince the skeptical and hostile mob bosses, Nardi says: ""This business is legitimate, totally, almost.""  ""Legitimate, totally, almost."" What a priceless set of descriptors -nothing in Danny Greene's world is left uncorrupted.You'll see a number of faces from The Sopranos here, plus one from 24 (Bob Gunton, who played presidential chief of staff Ethan Kanin), and veteran actor Paul Sorvino. All of them are good in roles that they could probably now play in their sleep, they've done them so often. The only square peg in the movie is Val Kilmer playing Cleveland cop Joe Manditski. His voice is used for voiceovers in transitions from one time to another and he appears on screen regularly, usually observing Greene from the other side of the street. The problem with Kilmer is two-fold: he doesn't have enough to do in the movie or enough motivation to do it to justify his repeated appearances on screen, and never all that slim, he has bulked out noticeably, with a blocky square face and squinty eyes that no longer seem capable of registering genuine emotion. But that's a small black mark in a movie that deserves a silver star over all.Buyers of the DVD receive a most welcome bonus: a fifty-some minute long documentary of the bomb wars in Cleveland in the mid-=70s, with interviews from many of those left standing when the wars were over  -Danny's ex-wife and daughter, a mob enforcer, a mob lawyer from Cleveland, an FBI agent, the retired chief of police, a nun who went to school with Danny when they children. It's very well done and quite informative.It may seem like I've told you a lot about the movie but there's still a lot unsaid, including some surprises at the end of both the movie and the

1428649,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B004UVYQYQ,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[3, 3]","KILL THE IRISHMAN""Kill the Irishman"" is a true story movie based on a man named Danny Greene that lived in Cleveland and his war on the mob in the 1970's. This story is absolutely true and the one of closest true story films I have. Danny was a Cleveland man of Irish decent who worked hard and didn't take anything form anybody. He was very proud of his heritage and really was into the Celtic Warriors of the past. So when the Italian Mob started in on him he started a war on them. His story is credited by all parties involved as the reason the Mob got taken down like they did.The film starts with Danny [Ray Stevenson] working on the docks of Cleveland in some pretty hard manual labor situations. When a man passes out from the heat and dehydration the men stop because the heat level is way too dangerous. That of course what the Union rules say to do any way but the Union boss says other wise and says if you want to keep a job you keep working. This altercation leads to Danny finally deciding that these days of the Mob running every thing is over. Danny was elected president of the International Longshoremen's Association and started running things the way he saw fit. Of course being a kid from the streets and involved in crime any way he kept things running in that life style, during this time made a lot of people mad including Jimmy Hoffa.From there we see when he lost the job due to the authorities cracking down on him. But it was also during this time that Danny strategically became an FBI informant. How could it be strategic one may ask, well because his sole purpose in life really was to bring down the Mob. So not only could he help the FBI do that but also as a protected informant he could up his criminal behavior without consequence. Greene started up his Mob of sorts called The Celtic Club which really was nothing more than an Irish Mafia. He would go on to plan or kill various Mob members and affiliates but at the same time work with an Italian named John Nardi. In this war with the Mafia Greene survived numerous assassination attempts including one that blew his house completely up while he was in it. This lead to Danny looking like the luck of the Irish was always on his side as it seemed he had nine lives like his pet cats.During this time Danny became a legend as he went on every TV news station and called the country's biggest gang aka the Mafia out. He literally went on TV and said something like ""let me clear something else up. I didn't run away from the explosion. Someone said they saw me running away. I walked away."" He would also on TV call them out with ""I have no axe to grind, but if these maggots in this so-called Mafia want to come after me, I'm over here by the Celtic Club. I'm not hard to find."" Of course that only lasted so long because they eventually did get him and the ending of this film was excellent. His death lead to the arrest of all kinds of Mafia members and was the beginning of the end for the unchallenged rule the Mafia had at the time.The film was great with an excellent script, director, and excellent actors. Ray Stevenson was the perfect choice to play Danny and he did an excellent job. Not only did he look like the guy but I believed he was this guy during the film. Christopher Walken as always is brilliant here as a loan shark that at first befriends Danny. Co star Val Kilmer feels like he is at his prime here as the real life Cleveland officer that befriended Danny. Vincent D'Onofrio was great as the Italian partner of Danny and of course Vinnie Jones is always great as he is here as Danny's main enforcer. The entire cast is great and I believed all of them as the characters they played. This film was produced by Tara Reid of all people but I assure you this is an excellent film. It also brings two Punishers together here as director Jonathan Hensleigh who directed the Thomas Jane starring ""Punisher"" film works with ""Punisher: War Zone"" star Ray Stevenson.The DVD comes with an excellent documentary that is very detailed and in depth with the people that were there.

1428650,A1IH42TUIZ2XJL,B004UVYQYQ,Gab,"[2, 2]","""Kill the Irishman"" is a gripping film based on the true story of Danny Greene, a tough, intelligent, proud Irish thug who took on the Mafia.  Danny Greene's activities eventually brought down the old-time Mafia nationwide.  Danny Greene, a dockworker, brilliantly portrayed by Ray Stevenson, violently took over the longshoreman's union in Cleveland and became ensnared in a power struggle with the Italian mob. He is legendary because he survived four horrific attempts to kill him during the 1970s.  The film uses actual news footage from the era reporting on those gang wars. The acting is stunning, authentic and the cast includes one of my favorite actors, Vincent D'Onofrio, star of the erstwhile ""Law and Order Criminal Intent"" series.  In addition to D'Onfrio, the stellar cast features Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Linda Cardellini, Robert Davi , Tony Darrow, , Vinnie Jones, Tony Lo Bianco, Laura Ramsey, Steve Schirripa, Paul Sorvino, Jason Butler Harner, Bob Gunton, and the stunning Fionnula Flanagan as Greene's tough talking no-nonsense neighbor.",5,Gripping Mob Film Based Upon Cleveland's Legendary Danny Greene,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,1065,"['Kill', 'Irishman', 'gripping', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'tough', 'intelligent', 'proud', 'Irish', 'thug', 'who', 'took', 'Mafia', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'activities', 'eventually', 'brought', 'down', 'old-time', 'Mafia', 'nationwide', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'dockworker', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'violently', 'took', 'over', 'longshoreman', 'union', 'Cleveland', 'became', 'ensnared', 'power', 'struggle', 'Italian', 'mob', 'legendary', 'survived', 'four', 'horrific', 'attempts', 'kill', '1970s', 'film', 'actual', 'news', 'footage', 'era', 'reporting', 'gang', 'wars', 'acting', 'stunning', 'authentic', 'cast', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'star', 'erstwhile', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'series', 'addition', ""D'Onfrio"", 'stellar', 'cast', 'features', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'Tony', 'Darrow', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'Laura', 'Ramsey', 'Steve', 'Schirripa', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'stunning', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Greene', 'tough', 'talking', 'no-nonsense', 'neighbor']",N/A

It was Cleveland, not Chicago, and our protagonist is a mobster himself, not an officer of the law. Ray Stevenson gives a strong portrayal of the problematic Danny Greene, a generous, brash, tough guy from a tough neighborhood who sees his fight with the Italian Mafia as inevitable, perhaps even noble. He isn't shown as a hero, though; he could be every bit as ruthless as the mob that is arrayed against him. Fine performances by Christopher Walken, Vincent Dinofrio, Val Kilmer and others bring this violent drama to life.I wouldn't want to watch this very often; it left me thinking sad thoughts about history and human nature. I think it was well worth watching once, and maybe more than once, though. Sometimes we need to look back, to look around, and to see things that aren't very pretty, things that are complicated and which leave us with feelings of ambivalence. The special features on this DVD include a short documentary on the real Danny Greene; forget the popcorn for this one.

1428656,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B004UVYQYQ,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 1]","Danny Green was an orphan who was raised by his drunken grandfather in the poor neighborhood of Collinwood.  Though he was an avid reader and an accomplished athlete, Danny dropped out of school and entered the world of Cleveland's organized crime.  He stole from the docks where he worked and muscled his way into becoming leader of the Longshoremen's Union.  Danny later joined forces with the Italian mobsters who controlled the garbage union.  Later, he organized his own Irish mob.  A mob war ensued, resulting in dozens of gangland assassinations, many of which involved car bombings.  After numerous failed attempts on his life, the indestructible Danny Greene was eventually killed by a car bomb which catapulted him to legendary status.""He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword"" was never truer than it is in director Jonathan Hensleigh's ""Kill the Irishman.""  This excellent film portrays the violent, bloody, shocking escapades of true-life criminal Danny Greene.  I've read innumerable crime dramas and I've never come across anything as shocking and gritty as ""Kill the Irishman.""  This film is rife with mobsters, hit men, betrayals, car explosions, and brains being blown out by head shots.  The acting from all the leads is top notch and the sets and costumes made me feel as though I was a child once again living back in those crazy seventies when America was experiencing a cultural and spiritual revolution.The beautiful Irish music, the Celtic warrior legends, and the family-like camaraderie of Danny's friends all combined to make me teary eyed when I saw Danny and his friends slaughtered one-by-one at the hands of New York's Italian mobsters.  However, watching the DVD's documentary, ""Danny Greene: The Rise and Fall of the Irishman,"" made me realize that Daniel J. Greene was more evil than I had imagined and that he should have died sooner.  Yes, during the holidays Danny donated turkeys to the downtrodden and underprivileged of Cleveland, but he left many children orphans by blowing their fathers apart with homemade explosives.  Worst of all, Danny was an informant for the FBI, which was never mentioned in the film, ""Kill the Irishman.""  Being an informant kept Danny out of prison.  In my opinion, betraying your own kind is simply deplorable.The documentary was just as enjoyable to watch as the film.  It also supports the accuracy of the film.  Ray Stevenson (""Thor,"" ""The Book of Eli"" and ""Punisher: War Zone"") bore a striking resemblance to the real Daniel J. Greene, known as the Robin Hood of Collinwood.  Again, I must say, his portrayal was remarkable.  He was such a complex character and I couldn't help but wonder if he was evil because of his environment or he simply chose to become evil.  I believe he squandered his talents and gifts when he was tempted into leading a life of crime.  Nevertheless, the film depicts how much influence the media has on our perception of criminals.  Sometimes, they can help turn criminals into heroes or antiheroes.  I must also mention that Val Kilmer (""Heat"" and ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") must've packed on some extra weight for his excellent portrayal of Detective Joe Manditski (based on the actual life of Cleveland Police Detective Ed Kovacic).Fans of bloody, violent, shocking crime drama and noir will definitely want to add ""Kill the Irishman"" to their DVD collections.  So will fans of true-life crimes.  Anchor Bay Entertainment did a great job of releasing it in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio with subtitles for the hearing impaired.  There is a theatrical trailer and the aforementioned documentary.  However, I was truly surprised to learn there are no deleted/extended scenes, no audio commentary and no making of featurettes.  All of these would have been appreciated by diehard fans of crime drama.  Nevertheless, this DVD is definitely worth the money and it the type of story that won't soon be forgotten.  The legend of Danny Greene will continue to live onward in the hearts of Collinwood residents for many generations.Joseph B.

Still, ""Kill the Irishman,"" is an entertaining flick about the criminal life of Danny Green, a self-proclaimed ""Celtic Warrior,"" who terrorized Cleveland in the 1960's and 1970's by bombing his enemies into oblivion. Of course, when you live by the bomb, you die by the bomb, and that's exactly what happened to Greene.Irish actor, Ray Stevenson, is believable and Celtic bold playing the part of Greene. However, the special parts of the movie take place when veteran actors Christopher Walken, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Paul Sorvino fill the screen, performing their acting quirks, which are almost un-duplicable. Val Kilmer is insipid as Greene old pal, turned cop, and I wonder if his character in the movie was necessary in the first place. There's also a nice turn by Robert Davi, as the hitman who finally outsmarts Greene and sends Greene to the Celtic Warrior in the Sky Club.This is an enjoyable movie for all mob movie fans. It's just not a great movie.

1428668,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004UVYQYQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[26, 28]","The biographical dramatization ""Kill The Irishman"" is one of those under the radar films that, I believe, people will discover and embrace through the DVD market.  Certainly not a perfect film--the movie does boast, however, a raw grittiness, larger than life performances, and an intriguing and spectacular true story begging for a big screen treatment.  And yet, the theatrical release was all but non-existent.  The film chronicles a mob war that escalated in Cleveland during the mid-seventies.  At the heart of the action is Danny Greene, played with vigor by Ray Stevenson, an Irish-American thug who becomes entrenched in the shenanigans of the Italian mafia.  With bluster and bravado, Greene stood his ground as an individual and even came to be championed by ordinary citizens for his more philanthropic endeavors.  By taking on the mob, very visibly and very vocally, Greene achieved a notoriety that is hard to ignore and sparked a murderous summer in 1976 that resulted in 36 Cleveland area bombings.The film introduces Greene as a physical laborer who, through righteousness and intimidation, ascends to the position of a local Union leader.  Taken down and imprisoned for corruption, however, brings the high life to an end--and he and his family are forced to build a new existence upon his release.  Through local connections (Vincent D'Onofrio and Christopher Walken), Greene soon finds himself taking on more responsibility with the mafia.  However, trying to establish his independence and tiring of their imposed leadership, Greene eventually raises their ire with his rebellious and confrontational ways.  This leads to all out war!  The film does an excellent job highlighting the political and power connections that start to unravel.  The resultant action is well done and harrowing--it is recreated with terrific specificity and attention to detail.  Fans of action and mob films will not be disappointed by the film's brutality.  The incorporation of real life news footage enhances the human drama as well.Central to the success of the film is Ray Stevenson (who I knew principally from HBO's Rome).  Stevenson gives a dynamic and fearless performance, strong but never alienating.  You can see why Greene appealed to people, but Stevenson never relinquishes his harder edge.  I loved him and, for me, he made the movie!  Bigger names (including Val Kilmer as a cop who inexplicably narrates this piece) are fine, but the picture belongs to Stevenson!  As a biography, however, the film makes some big jumps that would have defined its characters better.  The story with Greene's wife and family is fairly superficial, his normal friends turn into weapon carrying thugs with zero transition, and most egregiously--the film fails to generate any time for the most intriguing aspect of Greene's tale.  Greene became a popular cult figure with a Robin Hood mythology.  The movie spends all of about ten seconds explaining this fascinating development!  Still, this is a heck of a ride--all the more riveting because of its basis in real life.  Genre fans should appreciate the movie--but don't let the title scare you, this should also have more universal appeal!

While it has less glamour and grandeur than Scarface or Goodfellas, it's perhaps more realistic and down-to-earth.  Ray Stevenson certainly looks a lot like the real Danny Greene did.  But he is not quite as charismatic as Pacino, Pesci or Robert Mitchum.  Ray does a solid job though, and he is quite believable as a book-reading, hard-punching and fearless Celtic Warrior.  The supporting cast is perfect.  Even Vincent D'Onofrio, who is usually too affected and quirky for my tastes, makes the wise choice of playing his character as a nebbishy accountant instead of a one-dimensional thug.  It was great to see aging actors Paul Sorvino and Tony Lobianco play authentic, old-school mafia bosses.  This film will take you right back to the seventies and you'll be grateful.  The only unrealistic thing in the whole film to me was all the bare-handed beatdowns that Danny Greene dishes out.  At least slip on some leather gloves, for chrissake.  Bare fists against skull bones lead quickly to broken knuckles and fractured metacarpals.  But this is Danny Greene, I guess, who was an implausibly tough Irishman.

Especially in the early union related scenes.The biggest flaw in the script and the film is that it is too sentimental in its treatment of Danny Greene. These sorts of films are better when they can show both sides of this sort of character. They needed to make the point better that his behavior was often foolish and self-destructive. Val Kilmer's narration doesn't work well because its done alone from a outsider point of view within the story. Greene is the center of the script. Far too often friends and family come across as cyphers. And the hit-man who eventually kills Greene is too much of a terminator type robot character. Local mob guys go to New York.

On the good side they make us interested in a subject and hopefully look deeper into it rather than accept the film in blind faith. So it will be interesting to see what folks can learn about Danny Greene, the mobster and focus of the film KILL THE IRISHMAN.Green (as played by Ray Stevenson) is a local tough guy who comes up the hard way. Picked on by the Italians in his neighborhood, the rough little Irish kid grows up taking his licks but dishing them out as well. He grows into a man and goes the physical labor route most do without an education. But Danny reads. He's tough and smart, a deadly combination.When Danny's had enough of corrupt union leaders that care nothing for the men they represent, he takes on the local union boss and kicks him out. Now in charge of the union, Danny sets up shop and works with the Italian mob to steal from the loading docks he's in charge of. Along the way he picks up a wife, has a few kids and eventually gets charged with wrongdoing, losing his job.Back on the streets and looking for work, he goes to work for Shondor Birns (Christopher Walken), a Jewish mobster/loan shark. Danny learns the ins and outs of the business eventually taking on his boss. With a contract on his head, Danny decided to fight fire with fire. If that wasn't enough, Danny also eventually takes on the Italian mob as well, daring them to take him out.Looking into the truth behind the story you discover the numerous car bombings/deaths that took place in Cleveland when Danny Greene was around. Needless to say if you grew up in the 70s and in Danny's neighborhood, a bulletproof vest and a bunker in your house would have been a good investment. He was a violent man when called for but depicted here he had a soft side as well, helping people out at times. Then again he also dished out physical abuse for those late to the loan shark. So which side of Danny Greene is the real one? Only he knows.The movie tells the tale in straight forward fashion, only using flashbacks when police detective and boyhood friend Joe Manditski (Val Kilmer) narrates. Kilmer's character is one that is torn between loyalties to his boyhood friend yet at the same time being a stand up cop enforcing the law. It's a narrow path to walk down but he does the best he can.Stevenson is great here, depicting both sides of Greene and under laying the tough guy on the outside with the man who wants to help others as well. There always seems to be something simmering beneath that calm faade that Danny offers the public, a man of brute strength and unrepentant violence just waiting to be set free.The entire cast does a great job here. Walken is underused but makes the best of his onscreen time. Vincent D'Onofrio as Greene's friend in the mob John Nardi comes off as a low level mob guy who shoots for the stars and rarely reaches the top floor of the nearby buildings. Tony Lobianco turns in a fine performance of the local head of the mob in Cleveland who ends up getting help from big time New York boss Paul Sorvino.One of the best things included in this DVD is a short documentary about the real Danny Greene. Archive footage of Greene daring the mob to come get him, pictures of his life and times all blend to make this man interesting and at the same time show him for what he was, a low level mobster who attempted to paint a better image of himself than the actual life he led.This is a well made movie, one that entertains and that shows a mobster who, while he gets involved with them, is not Italian. Film makers seem to take an easy way out these days depicting all Italians as mobsters. This film shows that they don't have a lock on the crime world, that there are others involved as well. The story is interesting, the character one that holds your attention and the technical aspects show a well put together film. All in all this is a movie that's worth renting if not owning.",4,CLEVELAND ROCKS,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,4080,"['Movies', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'do', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'bad', 'side', 'make', 'believe', 'everything', ""'re"", 'witnessing', 'bare', 'facts', 'laid', 'out', 'cinematic', 'style', 'good', 'side', 'make', 'interested', 'subject', 'hopefully', 'look', 'deeper', 'rather', 'accept', 'film', 'blind', 'faith', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'folks', 'can', 'learn', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'mobster', 'focus', 'film', 'KILL', 'THE', 'IRISHMAN.Green', 'played', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'local', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'hard', 'way', 'Picked', 'Italians', 'neighborhood', 'rough', 'little', 'Irish', 'kid', 'up', 'taking', 'licks', 'dishing', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'physical', 'labor', 'route', 'most', 'do', 'education', 'Danny', 'reads', 'tough', 'smart', 'deadly', 'combination.When', 'Danny', 'had', 'enough', 'corrupt', 'union', 'leaders', 'care', 'nothing', 'men', 'represent', 'local', 'union', 'boss', 'kicks', 'out', 'Now', 'charge', 'union', 'Danny', 'up', 'shop', 'Italian', 'mob', 'steal', 'loading', 'charge', 'way', 'up', 'wife', 'few', 'kids', 'eventually', 'charged', 'wrongdoing', 'losing', 'job.Back', 'streets', 'looking', 'work', 'work', 'Shondor', 'Birns', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Jewish', 'mobster/loan', 'shark', 'Danny', 'ins', 'outs', 'business', 'eventually', 'taking', 'boss', 'contract', 'head', 'Danny', 'decided', 'fight', 'fire', 'fire', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Danny', 'also', 'eventually', 'Italian', 'mob', 'as', 'well', 'daring', 'take', 'out.Looking', 'truth', 'story', 'discover', 'numerous', 'car', 'bombings/deaths', 'took', 'place', 'Cleveland', 'when', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'was', 'around', 'Needless', 'say', 'grew', 'up', '70s', 'Danny', 'neighborhood', 'bulletproof', 'vest', 'bunker', 'house', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'investment', 'was', 'violent', 'man', 'when', 'called', 'depicted', 'here', 'had', 'soft', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'helping', 'people', 'out', 'times', 'Then', 'again', 'also', 'dished', 'out', 'physical', 'abuse', 'late', 'loan', 'shark', 'So', 'side', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'real', 'one', 'Only', 'movie', 'tale', 'straight', 'forward', 'fashion', 'only', 'using', 'flashbacks', 'when', 'police', 'detective', 'boyhood', 'friend', 'Joe', 'Manditski', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Kilmer', 'character', 'one', 'torn', 'loyalties', 'boyhood', 'friend', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'stand', 'up', 'cop', 'enforcing', 'law', 'narrow', 'path', 'walk', 'down', 'best', 'can.Stevenson', 'great', 'here', 'depicting', 'sides', 'Greene', 'laying', 'tough', 'guy', 'outside', 'man', 'who', 'help', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'be', 'something', 'simmering', 'beneath', 'faade', 'Danny', 'public', 'man', 'brute', 'strength', 'unrepentant', 'violence', 'just', 'waiting', 'be', 'set', 'free.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'Walken', 'underused', 'best', 'onscreen', 'time', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Greene', 'friend', 'mob', 'John', 'Nardi', 'off', 'low', 'level', 'mob', 'guy', 'who', 'stars', 'rarely', 'top', 'floor', 'nearby', 'buildings', 'Tony', 'Lobianco', 'fine', 'performance', 'local', 'head', 'mob', 'Cleveland', 'who', 'up', 'getting', 'help', 'big', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'boss', 'Paul', 'Sorvino.One', 'best', 'things', 'included', 'DVD', 'short', 'documentary', 'real', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'Archive', 'footage', 'Greene', 'daring', 'mob', 'come', 'get', 'pictures', 'life', 'times', 'blend', 'make', 'man', 'interesting', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'low', 'level', 'mobster', 'who', 'attempted', 'paint', 'better', 'image', 'actual', 'life', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'one', 'mobster', 'who', 'involved', 'not', 'Italian', 'Film', 'makers', 'seem', 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'days', 'depicting', 'Italians', 'mobsters', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lock', 'crime', 'world', 'are', 'others', 'involved', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'interesting', 'character', 'one', 'attention', 'technical', 'aspects', 'show', 'well', 'together', 'film', 'movie', 'worth', 'renting', 'not', 'owning']",N/A
1428674,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B004UVYQYQ,maskirovka,"[0, 0]","While ""Goodfellas"" remains the best mafia film I've seen,""Kill the Irishman"" ranks up there as a very solid flick that based on my reading of the real Danny Greene's Wikipedia page seems to reasonably correspond with his actual life.  The movie is lifted by the presence of an outstanding supporting cast including Christopher Walken and Paul Sorvino (both playing gangster roles they could do in their sleep).The movie certainly doesn't romanticize mob life like the Godfather Trilogy, but rather it presents the organized crime scene in Cleveland as a definitely blue collar environment where people were willing to killing each over significant sums of money but hardly what we'd consider to be bling-bling in the 21st century.The movie also presents its violence in a very matter of fact and non-stylized fashion that I think lends authenticity to the film as does the use of news footage from that era (where bombs were going off so much some people dubbed Cleveland the bomb capital of the USA).The only reason why I can't bring myself to give ""Kill the Irishman"" a five star rating is that near the end of the movie, the tone does sort of set up Danny Greene to be some sort of tragic heroic figure.  I have no doubt that he was  very charismatic and did do some good (albeit probably more for tactical and practical reasons).  However, the real Danny Greene was someone who killed people (admittedly most of them gangsters) and beat innocent people and coerced them into joining mobbed up unions.  So the playing of melancholy pipes at the end of the movie as the credits rolled as if the world had lost something when Greene died was a bit much.  Also, while Robert Davi is another great character, I found his behavior as Greene's ultimate nemesis a bit unbelievable.But overall, this is a very good movie and organized crime buffs almost certainly would enjoy it.",4,Excellent Movie but Not Quite in the Class of Goodfellas,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,1874,"['Goodfellas', 'best', 'mafia', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Kill', 'Irishman', 'up', 'there', 'very', 'solid', 'flick', 'based', 'reading', 'real', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'Wikipedia', 'page', 'reasonably', 'correspond', 'actual', 'life', 'movie', 'lifted', 'presence', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'playing', 'gangster', 'roles', 'could', 'do', 'sleep', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'romanticize', 'mob', 'life', 'Godfather', 'Trilogy', 'rather', 'organized', 'crime', 'scene', 'Cleveland', 'definitely', 'blue', 'collar', 'environment', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'willing', 'killing', 'significant', 'sums', 'money', 'hardly', 'what', ""'d"", 'consider', 'be', 'bling-bling', '21st', 'century.The', 'movie', 'also', 'violence', 'very', 'matter', 'fact', 'non-stylized', 'fashion', 'think', 'authenticity', 'film', 'use', 'news', 'footage', 'era', 'where', 'bombs', 'were', 'going', 'off', 'so', 'much', 'people', 'dubbed', 'Cleveland', 'bomb', 'capital', 'USA', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'give', 'Kill', 'Irishman', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'end', 'movie', 'tone', 'sort', 'set', 'up', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'be', 'sort', 'tragic', 'heroic', 'figure', 'have', 'doubt', 'was', 'very', 'charismatic', 'did', 'do', 'good', 'probably', 'more', 'tactical', 'practical', 'reasons', 'However', 'real', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'killed', 'people', 'admittedly', 'most', 'gangsters', 'beat', 'innocent', 'people', 'coerced', 'joining', 'mobbed', 'up', 'unions', 'playing', 'melancholy', 'pipes', 'end', 'movie', 'credits', 'rolled', 'world', 'had', 'lost', 'something', 'when', 'Greene', 'died', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'Also', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'great', 'character', 'found', 'behavior', 'Greene', 'ultimate', 'nemesis', 'bit', 'unbelievable.But', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'organized', 'crime', 'buffs', 'almost', 'certainly', 'would', 'enjoy']",N/A

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[23, 26]","It's very seldom that I say that a particular movie would have benefited from a longer running time, but in the case of KILL THE IRISHMAN, I think that an additional thirty minutes would have turned what is now an entertaining gangster movie into a classic of the genre.Written (with Jeremy Walters) and directed by Jonathan Hensleigh, KILL THE IRISHMAN is based on the true story of Danny Greene, an Irish-American thug, revered by his neighbors as a local ""Robin Hood,"" who in the 1970s, declared war on the Cleveland branch of the Italian Mafia.  Greene survived many assassination attempts and his bold efforts, ultimately, led to the collapse of the Mob syndicate throughout the United States.Ray Stevenson is quite effective as the ""take no prisoners"" Danny Greene, and he is supported by an excellent cast that includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Paul Sorvino, Robert Davi and several other actors who are familiar faces in Mob movies.The problem is that there are so many characters and so much plot, all fascinating, that are crammed into the movie's 106 minute running time that the film feels like an outline for a more extensive epic drama.  Great gangster movies (e.g. THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS) require texture and depth of characterization, while Hensleigh's picture presents the people who populate it with very broad strokes.Yes, I enjoyed the movie, but I think that HBO or Showtime might have done this story more justice.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a compelling documentary about the real Danny Greene.

Still the story like all gangster stories is fascinating and this guys story is one of the more important in the history of american crime. The movie has the feel of realism that is complemented by real vintage news footage from the 1970's too. The movie's style is influenced by the great gangster movies of the past too. the one one star review complains about this so ignore him, because this movie is gritty and realistic and it doesn't make greene into a hero really like gang rap does to modern thugs. To be honest we'd all be better off without one gangster on the whole planet, but still few stories of gang leaders are as spectacular as the rise and fall of the bloody danny greene. And to be honest , you can almost cheer him as his crew takes out the competition. Like all gang wars the police seem helpless until innocent people get killed. The hell's angel war in montreal was like that until a kid was blown up. But greene was a hundred times the man those guys were in spite of his being a murderer. This one is good historical movie and it sticks closely to the real story in many ways so that's a good thing. The acting is awesome too. The picture on blu ray looks fantastic as well it should this being a new movie. There is a documentary too about the real danny greene and that's disturbing as well. Especially the lawyer for the mobsters who laments all these nice people in the mob who went down for their crimes! He's so bad that he doesn't even realize it.There are no deleted scenes but this one is for gangster movie fans as well as history buffs. And thankfully it's mostly accurate , and greene killed many people and was fearless in hand to hand fighting as well. He could take down far larger men but he was also a terrible man as well.

Sure, there are some stereotypical mob characters, but they're not overdone. Additionally, the movie is coming from a book (based on real life events) in Cleveland and includes archival footage -- so there's a bit of real life mixed in with the fiction. It's a good action drama with a moderate amount of violence -- not overdone, but just about right for a story of this type.The main character, Danny Greene (Ray Stevenson), starts as a union boss and makes his way into organized crime. The storytelling moves along showing him try to move into something more ""normal"" -- until that no longer works and the violence starts as he becomes part of the mafia, despite his cozy plea bargain. As he gets involved in more and more of the world of crime and becomes a target himself, it is amazing how he stays fit both mentally and physically. The acting here is good, while at time pedestrian, still worthwhile. Other characters complement well, including the characters played by actors and Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio. Christopher Walken's role is small and fairly insignificant -- it would have been nicer to see him in a bigger role. Nonetheless, Stevenson is the star here.I would say the movie could be broken up into thirds -- the first with deep character development, the second the actions of the mob, with the last more specifically on the final days of Danny Greene. The suspense is pretty good towards the end, and keeps you interested up to the final moments of the film.

1428680,A11UO96AKBCGSZ,B004UVYQYQ,Mickey Ryan,"[8, 8]","I knew eventually a movie about the legendary Danny Greene will come out, and this was nicely done with a great cast. Im sure you know the true story by now - a ballsy Irish-American thug in 1970s Cleveland tests the Mafia to the limits with brazen acts of defiance, a time when the Cleveland Mafia often preferred car-bombs instead of guns. Ray Stevenson is a fine choice for Greene, Kilmer lights up the screen as the detective on the case (and semi-friend; who's well aware of Greene's inevitable fate), and D'Onofrio is terrific as low-level hood John Nardi. Excellent usage of real-life news footage of the events transpiring and the Celtic bagpipe backround tune is a true pleasure as well. A few thoughts:-Sorvino was a nice choice for Fat Tony Salerno of the Genovese Family but he should have been chewing a cigar in almost every scene, Salerno was notorious for this.-They should have showed more of the relationship between Greene and Jewish loanshark Shonder Birns (Walken), as this is how Greene really made his mark in the underworld. They missed alot of this but hey it is a 2 hour film.Other than a few minor flaws, this slick little mobster film is very entertaining and gangster fans especially will be glued to the screen. 4 Stars for Kill The Irishman.",4,"Oh Danny Boy, the bombs the guns are calling....",1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1272,"['knew', 'eventually', 'movie', 'legendary', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'great', 'cast', 'Im', 'sure', 'know', 'true', 'story', 'now', 'ballsy', 'Irish-American', 'thug', '1970s', 'Cleveland', 'Mafia', 'limits', 'brazen', 'acts', 'defiance', 'time', 'when', 'Cleveland', 'Mafia', 'often', 'preferred', 'car-bombs', 'instead', 'guns', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'fine', 'choice', 'Greene', 'Kilmer', 'up', 'screen', 'detective', 'case', 'semi-friend', 'who', 'well', 'aware', 'Greene', 'inevitable', 'fate', ""D'Onofrio"", 'terrific', 'low-level', 'hood', 'John', 'Nardi', 'Excellent', 'usage', 'real-life', 'news', 'footage', 'events', 'transpiring', 'Celtic', 'bagpipe', 'backround', 'tune', 'true', 'pleasure', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'thoughts', '-Sorvino', 'was', 'nice', 'choice', 'Fat', 'Tony', 'Salerno', 'Genovese', 'Family', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'chewing', 'cigar', 'almost', 'scene', 'Salerno', 'was', 'notorious', 'this.-They', 'should', 'have', 'showed', 'more', 'relationship', 'Greene', 'Jewish', 'loanshark', 'Shonder', 'Birns', 'Walken', 'how', 'Greene', 'really', 'made', 'mark', 'underworld', 'missed', 'alot', 'hey', '2', 'hour', 'film.Other', 'few', 'minor', 'flaws', 'slick', 'little', 'mobster', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'gangster', 'fans', 'especially', 'will', 'be', 'glued', 'screen', '4', 'Stars', 'Kill', 'Irishman']",N/A

1428682,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B004UVYQYQ,Mike,"[7, 8]","Three things I'd like to address up front.First, the box cover assertion that this is ""The best gangster film since Goodfellas."" No, actually, it's not. I'm tempted to give that honor to ""The Departed,"" but once again, that wasn't a classic ""mob"" movie in the sense of The Godfather, Goodfellas or Casino.While ""The Departed"" was a movie ""about"" the Irish mob, the real emphasis of the story was on the law enforcement officials...both upright and corrupt...caught in the vortex of trying to take the bad guys down.Second, Val Kilmer. He's prominently featured on the box cover, he's got third billing, and his character is basically a generic cop who also narrates the film. The role could have been played by anyone. If you're fresh off of watching ""Tombstone"" and are thinking ""Oh boy, a new Val Kilmer movie,"" think again. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but his interactions with Ray Stevenson's Danny Greene character are flat and unconvincing. Want to see genuine interplay between characters who grew up in ""the old neighborhood"" and are now damaged adults? Watch Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins in ""Mystic River.""Third, Christopher Walken. This isn't ""a Christopher Walken movie"" any more than it is ""a Val Kilmer movie,"" but he's in it, and that means expectations are going to be high among viewers with even a passing interest in his work. He's dead-center in the box cover artwork. He's not dead-center in the movie. As mobster Shondor Birns, he represents a turning point of sorts in Greene's life. Freshly ousted as head of the union, Birns offers him a ""collections"" position in his loan sharking business. Once again, I don't want to offer up a spoiler here, but the business relationship goes sideways and Greene's method of handling it takes his journey to another level. What you don't get, in the highly compressed time frame of a 106 minute movie, is the dynamic of the relationship between Birns and Greene...it is almost as if you are expected to assume that Birns is the bad guy because he is portrayed by Walken, who tosses off a few Walken-isms along the way. When the moment of truth arrives, you aren't left with a deep understanding of how things got to that point. You've been offered the events, but there's no glue to hold them together.Having said all of that, this might have made a far more engaging HBO (it would have to be on cable, due to the language and graphic violence) mini-series than a stand-alone movie, but it's still a 4-star movie.There is an excellent one hour documentary included, ""Danny Greene: The Rise and Fall of the Irishman,"" which I decided to watch before the movie...and I was glad I did. While it is a spoiler of sorts (you know the beginning, middle and end of the story before you watch the movie), when you actually do watch the film, there is a sense of cohesiveness I don't believe would have been there without it.It's just too big of a story to fit into one movie. Greene was the epitome of the enigmatic ""Robin Hood"" type, and as his first wife shares in the documentary, he could display great acts of kindness (10 paid scholarships in the best private school in town for 10 inner-city kids from poor families, 50+ hams at Easter to neighbors, 50+ turkeys on Thanksgiving and Christmas to the same neighbors, paying 3 months' back rent for a neighbor, ridding the neighborhood of a rowdy biker gang), he was also prone to acts of extreme violence.I can't predict how you'll react to the good man / bad man balance in the Greene character. I'm also not a scholar when it comes to the real-life events so I can't tell you if he is portrayed as a ""better"" or ""worse"" man than the real-life Greene.Within 5 years of his death, as the result of a chain of events that followed, the FBI had essentially wiped out the U.S. presence of La Cosa Nostra. So it is impossible to separate ""good"" and ""evil"" in this movie...and it is usually the same in real life. Good people do bad things. Bad people do good things. There is no black and white sharp defining line. We blur those lines every day that we are breathing.The movie also effectively incorporates news footage of the real Danny Greene and news reports from the era. The story is brutal. When we see Greene sitting with his new girlfriend and discussing a move to Texas, to get away from it all and start a new life, it's pretty much a guarantee that he's not going to make it to Texas.So if you set your expectations to what I have shared here...that this is not ""the best gangster film since Goodfellas,"" that the performances by Walken and Kilmer are far from ""career defining,"" and that you will need a sense of history and the chain of events to understand how things get from point ""A"" to point ""B,"" and then to point ""C""...I think you'll really enjoy this film.Most likely, if you watch the film and documentary in whatever order you choose, then watch the film a second time, you will enjoy it more than if you just hit the film cold on your first viewing.Highly recommended.",4,"Not your average, run-of-the-mill mob movie",1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,5019,"['Three', 'things', ""'d"", 'like', 'address', 'up', 'front.First', 'box', 'cover', 'assertion',

Greene, who like many Public Relation's wise mobsters was often the local ""Robin Hood. Except that the tender side of Danny Greene was not about PR, it was about who he was.

Greene responded to and declared war upon a branch of the Cleveland Mob which was aided, abetted and directed later by the New York ""GoodFellas"" gang. As the murders, bombings, stabbings and beatings rapidly progressed, we unfortunately, probably because of budget constraints, were given little time or background to know and assess most of the characters before they became a part of the carnage.This was a far better than a middle of the road action, crime film. It had the quality of an Indy film, the stars of a Main Stream film and the fast action of a superhero film, but this seeming superhero was a real life person. The story is narrated by a police Lieutenant (Val Kilmer, looking Chubby and much like a character actor) who was a athletic colleague of Greene's in High school and somewhat of an admirer.With a fearless and insistent warrior personality, Danny Greene, reminding one of a little of the approach taken by the Prophet David or Michael Corleone while taking his vows for God Father of his niece while his men are wiping out the opposition and the untrusted, but even more like Glenn Ford in western, The Violent Ones, in which Ford, like Danny Greene, becomes personally involved in the mayhem.Over the summer of 1976, three dozen bombs devastated the heart of Cleveland as the substance of a war by the Mob over personalities, cash,  territories and ""business"".  It was Danny Greene and his pals pitted against not only the Cleveland Mafia, but the New York Mob as well. Danny Greene mete's out his brand of justice in a fast track rise from a tough Cleveland neighborhood guy with an old world brand of Justice, to become an enforcer in the local Mafia against the Main Stream Mob causing all Hell to break loose between the Mob, unions and independents as well.Ray Stevenson was a knockdown, no holds barred, tough guy, as were all of those who surrounded him, and like a comic book super hero he seemed impossible to kill.The acting was excellent, the direction was good, but the story line did lack a few details, which might have helped. However, the action moved so fast, that for the most part the few missing details seemed unnecessary. The pulling away, the often tenuous and then growing gap between him and his wife was very much unlike the loyalties of most Italian Mafia marriages. As far as sex goes; Greene's new girlfriend (Actress Laura Ramsey) after his failed marriage  was much more devoted than his wife, and had a higher tolerance for his sort of ""business."" Actress Laura Ramsey was also hot in an alluring a negligee' lovely breasts exposed as she is about to seduce Ray Stevenson's Danny Greene. There is also a brief scene of intercourse in an automobile with Greene's wife before their marriage, but little can be seen because they are partially clothed. In this film, the men's, tribal, clannishness, and violence, dominates center stage.The film's atmosphere was dead-on, 1960'ws/1970's. The writers and director avoid the foolish, clich&eacute;' copy-cat trend of bopping back and forth from one unessential event to another, which lead to a wrapping of many films in a spiral of distractions and off subject sideshows, that add nothing to the plot of modern movies. Instead it does the right thing, the thing, which moves the movie along with no-nonsense lightening speed. Focusing completely on building tension and suspense and stick with what is at hand and paramount, is the right thing and makes for respectful kudos from movie-goers and writers/directors in the know.Greene survived many assassination attempts and his bold efforts, ultimately, led to the collapse of the Cleveland Mob syndicate and their satellites throughout the United States.Co-writer `s were Jeremy Walters, from the book by Rick Porrello who acted as executive producer of the movie, which was directed by Jonathan Hensleigh.It is more than a bit violent, but not nearly as graphic as the savage and horrific displays of Criminal Minds blood, guts and worse programs and contains here and there a few moments of self-affacing humor.While falling short of the Godfather series, it is certainly less graphic than GoodFellas.I give it 4.25 stars out of 5.",5,"Budda Bing, Budda Bang; But Partially in Gaelic",1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,4871,"['Kill', 'IrishmanKill', 'Irishman',

His heartfelt performance as a lovable, murderous lug may not have made him a box office star but did win him a dedicated following.Apparently those select few were the only people to go see his leading man performance in ""Kill the Irishman,"" which opened on a whopping 5 screens.  Perhaps America is too focused on the Vegas-New York Mafia axis, but we should appreciate that there are bad guys in other cities, too - and at one point Cleveland was a city worth fighting over.Stevenson plays real-life gangster Danny Greene, a tough Irish criminal who worked his way up through the Cleveland mob with his unique combination of brains and brawn.  To his credit, Greene was also a racist son-of-a-gun who had contempt for anyone who wasn't Irish - that and he had a mean streak a mile wide.  But Stevenson can't help but be a lovable lug; the guy is a walking Little John.  And so it is that the audience instantly sides with Greene as he goes toe to toe with every mobster under the sun, even as he second-rates his wife.""Kill the Irishman"" is far from a great film, but it is an enjoyable, gritty movie.  Grounded in realism, this is not another Tarantino riff on the gangster movie, but is instead a straight-up mob movie about the guys who wish they were as highbrow as the Corleones.  Problems are raised and solved as they often are in gangster movies - we tread no new ground here.  But there's a distinct pleasure in watching Jonathan Hensleigh's movie in that we get the sense that these are real people fighting real-world battles in a real-world city.

The annoying trait, many of them possess, are the heroic portrayals of men who engaged in criminal behavior.  Often they are shown as people who had to do it, because they had a hard life.  I disagree.  They had a hard life because they chose a life of crime and all the drama that came with it is their fault.In this movie, I found none of that.  Danny Greene, in this film, is not glamorized in any way.  The film just tells his story and it was very interesting.  There are alot of ups and downs in his life and it is his fault because he makes bad decisions.The movie is about one hour and thirty-five minutes not counting the credits at the end.  The film moves by very fast and, because of its quick pace, one does not feel bored watching this film.  Even though the film is not that long, the character of Greene is well-explained.  He sometimes has too much pride and that causes him to get into a lot of unnecessary conflicts.  Ultimately, he pays a price for it.The setting of the film adds to the flavor.  Everything, from the cars to the homes, looks rundown.  Overall, five stars for the movie.

Ray Stevenson does an excellent job portraying Danny Greene while Val Kilmer was less than spectacular as the detective investigating him. Perhaps the writers didn't know what personality to give Kilmer, so they left it out. In spite of Danny Greene's criminal exploits, we have empathy for him. Danny is both tough and smart is spite of not completing high school. His blue collar rise to the top gives us the bad guy ""walking tall"" feel.Once Danny is caught, things change. He makes a deal to stay out of prison by becoming a snitch to the surprise of Val Kilmer, but he is not a very good snitch. In one scene, Danny decides to clean up his own neighborhood by going up against a local biker gang. His wife (Linda Cardellini) watches Danny beat up a biker in the street and she appears to be surprised at his actions after being married to the guy for several years, knowing he is a mobster. She is not supportive.Danny is forced to do things he doesn't want to do, or at least that is how the film portrays Danny, as the kindly neighborhood bill collector, who only busts kneecaps when he has to.

1428707,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B004UVYQYQ,Tommy Dooley,"[2, 2]","Set in Cleveland during the 1970's, this film from director Jonathan Hensleigh (`The Punisher' series) tells the true -ish story of Danny Greene. He was an impoverished second generation Irish man, but in America the apple never falls far from the tree, so he is still considered to be Irish - hence the title. I am second generation Irish, but feel totally English except that I do better singing when intoxicated (it's in the genes apparently). Any hoo, Danny (Ray Stevenson) is a big man with big ideas and a streak of pride that garners him admiration and the enmity of people in equal measure.He starts on the docks and soon becomes the spokesman for the Longshoreman; his unofficial role soon becomes bona fide when he unceremoniously ousts the corrupt Union Boss. However, the power soon gets to him, actually before the paint has dried on his new green stairway. His carefree attitude towards other peoples' property soon gains him the attention of the mafia. As per usual everyone wants a split. Danny meanwhile gets busted and has to start all over.This is a hard and gritty tale that uses some of the news reels from the time and it is amazing how many bombs were detonated around this time, like a microcosm of Beirut. Danny seems to have nine lives and a fear of no-one, it all builds up a head of steam that sees him upsetting one person too many and then all hell kicks off.This is a well made and acted film that sadly went straight to DVD, well who wants to go to the cinema anyway? Apart from lots of people with their money that is. Besides that this ticks all the boxes, there is a love interest, there are some famous names, like Val Kilmer as the good cop who put his badge first. The nasty crime boss, Shonder Birns played by Christoher Walken and loads of proper unchoreographed action. There is also great period detail with some fantastic old American cars, that all too frequently end up in a failed bid to reach outerspace thanks to the addition of some explosives. There is also Vinny Jones who does for the Irish accent what Dick van Dyke did for Cockneys, but he is quite likeable despite that.All in all a well made and paced film and at 101 minutes is perfectly timed too, the music is good also; there is so much to like here that if gangster type films is your thing, then it would be churlish not to give it a go - recommended.",4,`A Man You Don't Meet Everyday',1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,2363,"['Set', 'Cleveland', '1970', 'film', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Hensleigh', 'Punisher', 'series', 'true', '-ish', 'story', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'was', 'impoverished', 'second', 'generation', 'Irish', 'man', 'America', 'apple', 'never', 'far', 'tree', 'still', 'considered', 'be', 'Irish', 'hence', 'title', 'am', 'second', 'generation', 'Irish', 'feel', 'totally', 'English', 'do', 'better', 'singing', 'when', 'intoxicated', 'genes', 'apparently', 'hoo', 'Danny', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'big', 'man', 'big', 'ideas', 'streak', 'pride', 'admiration', 'enmity', 'people', 'equal', 'measure.He', 'docks', 'soon', 'spokesman', 'Longshoreman', 'unofficial', 'role', 'soon', 'bona', 'fide', 'when', 'unceremoniously', 'corrupt', 'Union', 'Boss', 'However', 'power', 'soon', 'actually', 'paint', 'dried', 'new', 'green', 'stairway', 'carefree', 'attitude', 'other', 'peoples', 'property', 'soon', 'gains', 'attention', 'mafia', 'usual', 'everyone', 'split', 'Danny', 'meanwhile', 'busted', 'start', 'over.This', 'hard', 'gritty', 'tale', 'news', 'reels', 'time', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'bombs', 'were', 'detonated', 'time', 'microcosm', 'Beirut', 'Danny', 'have', 'nine', 'lives', 'fear', 'no-one', 'up', 'head', 'steam', 'upsetting', 'one', 'person', 'too', 'many', 'then', 'hell', 'kicks', 'off.This', 'well', 'made', 'acted', 'film', 'sadly', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'well', 'who', 'go', 'cinema', 'anyway', 'Apart', 'lots', 'people', 'money', 'boxes', 'love', 'interest', 'are', 'famous', 'names', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'good', 'cop', 'who', 'put', 'badge', 'first', 'nasty', 'crime', 'boss', 'Shonder', 'Birns', 'played', 'Christoher', 'Walken', 'loads', 'proper', 'unchoreographed', 'action', 'also', 'great', 'period', 'detail', 'fantastic', 'old', 'American', 'cars', 'too', 'frequently', 'end', 'up', 'failed', 'bid', 'reach', 'outerspace', 'thanks', 'addition', 'explosives', 'also', 'Vinny', 'Jones', 'who', 'Irish', 'accent', 'what', 'Dick', 'van', 'Dyke', 'did', 'Cockneys', 'quite', 'likeable', 'that.All', 'well', 'made', 'paced', 'film', '101', 'minutes', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'too', 'music', 'good', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'here', 'gangster', 'type', 'films', 'thing', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'churlish', 'not', 'give', 'go', 'recommended']",N/A

Its capable actors and nice period details aside, the biopic feels less engaging than it should, trying to cover too much.""Kill the Irishman"" feels rushed, with several major events (including deaths) that are described in an uninvolving way. Take Christopher Walken's role, Alex ""Shondor"" Birns, for example. Danny Greene's relationship with this night club owner sours quickly when $75,000 from a New York crime family is lost. The episode and what follows the subsequent dispute over the loan between the two, which I think require more detailed narrative, unfold too fast, leaving us with a feeling ""Is that all?""I am a big Christopher Walken fan and my complaint has to do with the fact the filmmakers assembled a great cast of players all ready to show what they can do, and hardly give them chances.

He considers himself the heir to Celtic warriors and proves, at least for awhile he is indestructible.There is an almost poignant flavor to the ending - the music, the last farewells, although that was not what they were known to be at the time.This is an outstanding film of the gangster genre...well done, well acted.",5,The Gangs of  Cleveland,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,1107,"['Kill', 'Irishman', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'long', 'documentary', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Irishman', 'very', 'informative', 'subject', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'movie', 'better', 'understanding', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'main', 'feature', 'not', 'extras', 'also', 'movie', 'trailer', 'sound', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'being', 'actual', 'film', 'event', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'course', 'violence', 'blood', 'lot', 'fists', 'used', 'bombs', 'going', 'off', 'oh', 'yes', 'use', 'f-word', 'resulting', 'R', 'rating.It', 'excellent', 'account', 'actual', 'events', 'fighting', 'control', 'Cleveland', 'Danny', 'Greene', 'Irishman', 'trying', 'acquire', 'control', 'mob', 'activities', 'heir', 'Celtic', 'warriors', 'proves', 'least', 'awhile', 'indestructible.There', 'almost', 'poignant', 'flavor', 'ending', 'music', 'last', 'farewells', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'were', 'known', 'be', 'time.This', 'outstanding', 'film', 'gangster', 'genre', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'acted']",N/A
