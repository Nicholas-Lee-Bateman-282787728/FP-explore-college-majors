Somehow I  had missed seeing this when it aired on television back in the 90's. This person compared  this to to the 95 Pride and Prejudice. She said back when she was in high school and her friends were going ""ga-ga"" over Colin Firth and Pride and Prejudice, she was going ""ga-ga"" over this!  As I loved that adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, that was enough to convince me to watch this!A wonderful story of 4 American girls from wealthy families who go to England for a season. You see they were ""new"" money and so snubbed by American society. Three of the girls marry into titled families.A fairy tale? Not exactly as only one of these young women end up happily married.

Anderson,"[12, 17]","Many reviewers note that this is not Jane Austen because it lacks the joy and wit of Jane Austen, and that's true, but the most notable difference is that Jane Austen's characters own their mistakes.  Everybody in this movie makes idiotic choices and then blames society.  Nobody accepts their contribution to the misery and stupidity of their own lives.  It's alway the fault of society.  Isn't that criminal reasoning?  It gets very frustrating after a while.  My favorite part was when Michael Kitchen's character called the governess on this very behavior (I love you, Mr. Foyle!).  She was sobbing something like, ""Why can't a woman ever have free will!""  And he said, ""Well, you certainly exercised your free will here.""  Which was absolutely true.All these young women are extremely wealthy and get married of their own volition on a whim and then cry about the cruelty of society for the rest of the movie.  I would have enjoyed this movie if the moral had been ""Make wise choices.""  But the moral was ""Society is a cruel mistress.""  And it was annoying because everyone's misery was their own doing.Mira Sorvino's accent was a continual delight.  Why couldn't she have been the main character?  Her storyline seemed the most touching, too, but we only get glimpses of it.  Her accent was really too cute.  Best part of the movie.  But why did everyone seem to think they speak Spanish in Brazil?This movie also had way too many characters.  4 hours and I don't know anyone's name!",3,Weak characters,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,1489,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'note', 'not', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'joy', 'wit', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'true', 'most', 'notable', 'difference', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'characters', 'own', 'mistakes', 'Everybody', 'movie', 'idiotic', 'choices', 'then', 'society', 'Nobody', 'contribution', 'misery', 'stupidity', 'own', 'lives', 'alway', 'fault', 'society', ""n't"", 'criminal', 'reasoning', 'very', 'frustrating', 'while', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'character', 'called', 'governess', 'very', 'behavior', 'love', 'Mr', 'Foyle', 'was', 'sobbing', 'something', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'woman', 'ever', 'have', 'free', 'will', 'said', 'Well', 'certainly', 'exercised', 'free', 'will', 'here', 'was', 'absolutely', 'true.All', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'extremely', 'wealthy', 'get', 'married', 'own', 'volition', 'whim', 'then', 'cry', 'cruelty', 'society', 'rest', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'moral', 'had', 'been', 'Make', 'wise', 'choices', 'moral', 'was', 'Society', 'cruel', 'mistress', 'was', 'annoying', 'everyone', 'misery', 'was', 'own', 'doing.Mira', 'Sorvino', 'accent', 'was', 'continual', 'delight', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'main', 'character', 'storyline', 'seemed', 'most', 'touching', 'too', 'only', 'get', 'glimpses', 'accent', 'was', 'really', 'too', 'cute', 'Best', 'part', 'movie', 'why', 'did', 'everyone', 'seem', 'think', 'speak', 'Spanish', 'Brazil', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'characters', '4', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'name']",The Buccaneers VHS

390886,AC3064RV9PV62,630394325X,"A. Masion ""history lover and realist""","[128, 144]","I love Edith Whartion, the Gilded Age, and BBC productions.  This film should have been an ideal purchase for me.  Instead it was a raving disappointment.The first third or so of the series remained fairly close to the book, but the remainder mutated into soap opera sensationalism nonsense.After watching this horror of a 5 hour series, I did a search online and found an interview with the screenplay authoress who admitted to tweaking the novel's plotlines to add interest and allow for the sensibilities of a modern audience.In this particular miniseries liberties were taken with the storyline that completely affected the original intent and tone of the story.Julius, Nan's husband, is portrayed as a bisexual, adulterer, and a marital rapist.  Watching Julius's characterisation unfold was like witnessing a train wreck.Nan and Julius's marriage was supposed to be the story of how a relationship fails when two good people, very young and not knowing themselves well, rush into marriage and discover disillusionment.  Instead BBC treated its audience to Hollywoodized trite depicting Nan as a wronged wife ill-treated by a remote husband.There was also something horribly off about the portrayal of Laura Testvalley's friendship with Nan.  I love period pieces and I understand that social customs regarding intimate friendships in the past might seem TOO intimate at times to us strait-laced Americans, but the characters' scenes started creeping me out.  The mood of the scenes struck me as more romantic than friendly/sisterly/intimate.  In a way it was almost a relief when Julius was ""outed"" because I almost expected the two women to fall in love.The one bright spot in this wreck of Wharton was Greg Wise (Guy Thwaite) who played his character with complete conviction and looked gorgeous beyond belief in white tie ensembles.  It probably helped that Thwaite was one of the few characters allowed to retain the core Wharton penned him in to begin with.  I felt like most of the other characters were strangers.The series has some nice sets and locations and costumes appear in all their Gilded Age glory.  Americans can't help but loathe the British aristocracy and their mercenery desire to marry money and then refuse to support their wives since it's beneath them to work.  If you're looking for a faithful or even reasonably faithful production of the novel, though, you'll only be disappointed.",1,I Wish I'd Known What I was buying...,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,2415,"['love', 'Edith', 'Whartion', 'Gilded', 'Age', 'BBC', 'productions', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ideal', 'purchase', 'Instead', 'was', 'raving', 'disappointment.The', 'first', 'third', 'so', 'series', 'remained', 'fairly', 'close', 'book', 'remainder', 'mutated', 'soap', 'opera', 'sensationalism', 'nonsense.After', 'watching', 'horror', '5', 'hour', 'series', 'did', 'search', 'online', 'found', 'interview', 'screenplay', 'authoress', 'who', 'admitted', 'tweaking', 'novel', 'plotlines', 'add', 'interest', 'allow', 'sensibilities', 'modern', 'audience.In', 'particular', 'miniseries', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'storyline', 'completely', 'affected', 'original', 'intent', 'tone', 'story.Julius', 'Nan', 'husband', 'portrayed', 'bisexual', 'adulterer', 'marital', 'rapist', 'Watching', 'Julius', 'characterisation', 'unfold', 'was', 'witnessing', 'train', 'wreck.Nan', 'Julius', 'marriage', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'story', 'how', 'relationship', 'when', 'two', 'good', 'people', 'very', 'young', 'not', 'knowing', 'well', 'rush', 'marriage', 'discover', 'disillusionment', 'Instead', 'BBC', 'treated', 'audience', 'Hollywoodized', 'trite', 'depicting', 'Nan', 'wronged', 'wife', 'ill-treated', 'remote', 'husband.There', 'was', 'also', 'something', 'horribly', 'portrayal', 'Laura', 'Testvalley', 'friendship', 'Nan', 'love', 'period', 'pieces', 'understand', 'social', 'customs', 'regarding', 'intimate', 'friendships', 'past', 'might', 'seem', 'TOO', 'intimate', 'times', 'strait-laced', 'Americans', 'characters', 'scenes', 'started', 'creeping', 'mood', 'scenes', 'struck', 'more', 'romantic', 'friendly/sisterly/intimate', 'way', 'was', 'almost', 'relief', 'when', 'Julius', 'was', 'outed', 'almost', 'expected', 'two', 'women', 'fall', 'love.The', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'wreck', 'Wharton', 'was', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'Guy', 'Thwaite', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'complete', 'conviction', 'looked', 'gorgeous', 'belief', 'white', 'tie', 'ensembles', 'probably', 'helped', 'Thwaite', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'characters', 'allowed', 'retain', 'core', 'Wharton', 'penned', 'begin', 'felt', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'strangers.The', 'series', 'nice', 'sets', 'locations', 'costumes', 'appear', 'Gilded', 'Age', 'glory', 'Americans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'loathe', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'mercenery', 'desire', 'marry', 'money', 'then', 'refuse', 'support', 'wives', 'beneath', 'work', ""'re"", 'looking', 'faithful', 'even', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'production', 'novel', 'though', ""'ll"", 'only', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Buccaneers VHS

390889,A57JWK56OUKLZ,630394325X,Amber,"[2, 6]","What a totally depressing representation of marriage. I have never read the book and did not know what to expect, but the movie sounded interesting, as I find period pieces enjoyable. The first couple of hours were not terrible and actually drew me in, but then the main characters got married and everything went downhill quick! Marriage, as protrayed in this movie, is a horrible, dreadful thing where the men never stop their side affairs and the wives are forced to find lovers. One man tells his wife, on their wedding day, mind you, he only married her for her money. The other is a homosexual, who we discreetly find out about when the horse groomer gives him a flirty wink, and then we find out in whole, when they are discovered wrapped in each others arms, sleeping in bed (with smiles on their faces). Nan is the unfortunate married to this fellow. But what is quite hard to understand is why Julius (her husband) pursued her so ardently in the first place if his feelings are for men. Second, is why Nan had such fun with Julius before she married him, and then when he wants to sleep with her, she shrieks and crys. What happened to change her feelings? No explanation. She goes completely cold on him after that and seeks out the man she would have married if he hadn't left for a job in a faraway country, but now has returned. The few characters in this movie who seem to think marriage is for life, and that if both husband and wife would put aside selfishness and try to please the other - a good marriage is possible, are made to look loony. Basically this is a movie that shouts if you're not happy, find a way to make it happen. The whole second half of the film was like a bad soap opera and for this reason, I'd say skip this movie if you put any value in marriage.",2,why get married if it ends up like this?,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,1788,"['What', 'totally', 'depressing', 'representation', 'marriage', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'find', 'period', 'pieces', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'couple', 'hours', 'were', 'not', 'terrible', 'actually', 'drew', 'then', 'main', 'characters', 'got', 'married', 'everything', 'went', 'downhill', 'quick', 'Marriage', 'protrayed', 'movie', 'horrible', 'dreadful', 'thing', 'where', 'men', 'never', 'stop', 'side', 'affairs', 'wives', 'are', 'forced', 'find', 'lovers', 'One', 'man', 'wife', 'wedding', 'day', 'mind', 'only', 'married', 'money', 'other', 'homosexual', 'who', 'discreetly', 'find', 'out', 'about', 'when', 'horse', 'groomer', 'flirty', 'wink', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'whole', 'when', 'are', 'discovered', 'wrapped', 'others', 'arms', 'sleeping', 'bed', 'smiles', 'Nan', 'unfortunate', 'married', 'fellow', 'what', 'quite', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'Julius', 'husband', 'pursued', 'so', 'ardently', 'first', 'place', 'feelings', 'are', 'men', 'Second', 'why', 'Nan', 'had', 'such', 'fun', 'Julius', 'married', 'then', 'when', 'sleep', 'crys', 'What', 'happened', 'change', 'feelings', 'explanation', 'completely', 'cold', 'out', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'married', 'had', ""n't"", 'left', 'job', 'faraway', 'country', 'now', 'returned', 'few', 'characters', 'movie', 'who', 'seem', 'think', 'marriage', 'life', 'husband', 'wife', 'would', 'put', 'aside', 'selfishness', 'try', 'please', 'other', 'good', 'marriage', 'possible', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'loony', 'Basically', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'happy', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'happen', 'whole', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'reason', ""'d"", 'say', 'skip', 'movie', 'put', 'value', 'marriage']",The Buccaneers VHS

The girls' beauty, their lovely costumes (there must've been dozens of costume changes between them!), the breathtaking cinematography and the lavish lifestyle of the English aristocrats captured in such rich and vivid detail on film, are already enough to make this period drama a winner!The storyline itself is very romantic. It traces the love lives of 3 rich American girls (and a vivacious Italian girl, Conchita, played by Mira Sorvino) from their young, innocent and carefree days in America right up to their stay in England where the 3 Americans (Nan, her older sister Virginia and their friend, Lizzie) unexpectedly end up being married to rich/titled English fops and how the girls are forced to ""grow-up"" quickly and deal with the heartaches and demands that come with their marriage.The heroine of the heroines is Annabelle ""Nan"" St George (played to perfection by Carla Gugino), a kind, naive but rather headstrong girl who marries a Duke (a sullen, uptight and boring young man who's more obsessed with the mechanics and tick-tock of clocks than he is of his young lovely bride). But Nan realizes later that she actually loves another, Guy Thwaite. Then, there're the villains - an unfaithful husband, a kept mistress but most of all, the domineering/greedy in-laws. However, over time, the girls mature and learn how to deal with and make a success of their ""situation"". In the end, they triumphed against all odds and emerged victorious, finding true happiness in love.The male actors (who portrayed the husbands/lovers) are not worth commenting much on. All of them (save for Greg Wise) have a most haughty air about them that is oh, so hateful, although I admit their acting is good. But if only better-looking actors have been cast for the roles...I watched ""The Buccaneers"" on videotape 6 years ago (in 2000!) and am glad it is now finally available on DVD. I loved this production and highly recommend it to fans of period dramas. The video I own is a box-set in 3 tapes. The story itself takes up 2 tapes. Tape no. 3 is a documentary on Edith Wharton's life but it features mostly still photographs and portraits of 19th century people and their costumes, pictures of old American houses from during Wharton's time and interviews with experts on American history and period costumes, etc. I think the DVD should contain the same special features.",5,Highly Recommended!,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,2409,"['What', 'wonderfully', 'gorgeous', 'production', 'girls', 'beauty', 'lovely', 'costumes', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dozens', 'costume', 'changes', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'English', 'aristocrats', 'captured', 'such', 'rich', 'vivid', 'detail', 'film', 'are', 'already', 'enough', 'make', 'period', 'winner', 'storyline', 'very', 'romantic', 'love', '3', 'rich', 'American', 'girls', 'vivacious', 'Italian', 'girl', 'Conchita', 'played', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'young', 'innocent', 'carefree', 'days', 'America', 'right', 'up', 'stay', 'England', 'where', '3', 'Americans', 'Nan', 'older', 'sister', 'Virginia', 'friend', 'Lizzie', 'unexpectedly', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'married', 'rich/titled', 'English', 'fops', 'how', 'girls', 'are', 'forced', 'grow-up', 'quickly', 'deal', 'heartaches', 'demands', 'come', 'marriage.The', 'heroine', 'heroines', 'Annabelle', 'Nan', 'St', 'George', 'played', 'perfection', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'kind', 'naive', 'rather', 'headstrong', 'girl', 'who', 'Duke', 'sullen', 'uptight', 'boring', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'obsessed', 'mechanics', 'tick-tock', 'clocks', 'young', 'lovely', 'Nan', 'later', 'actually', 'Guy', 'Thwaite', 'Then', ""'re"", 'villains', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'kept', 'mistress', 'most', 'domineering/greedy', 'in-laws', 'However', 'time', 'girls', 'mature', 'learn', 'how', 'deal', 'make', 'success', 'situation', 'end', 'triumphed', 'odds', 'emerged', 'victorious', 'finding', 'true', 'happiness', 'love.The', 'male', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'husbands/lovers', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'commenting', 'much', 'save', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'have', 'most', 'haughty', 'air', 'oh', 'so', 'hateful', 'admit', 'acting', 'good', 'only', 'better-looking', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'roles', 'watched', 'Buccaneers', 'videotape', '6', 'years', 'ago', '2000', 'am', 'glad', 'now', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'loved', 'production', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'period', 'dramas', 'video', 'own', 'box-set', '3', 'tapes', 'story', 'up', '2', 'tapes', 'Tape', '3', 'documentary', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'life', 'mostly', 'still', 'photographs', 'portraits', '19th', 'century', 'people', 'costumes', 'pictures', 'old', 'American', 'houses', 'Wharton', 'time', 'interviews', 'experts', 'American', 'history', 'period', 'costumes', 'etc', 'think', 'DVD', 'should', 'contain', 'same', 'special', 'features']",The Buccaneers VHS

It's also frowned upon when they want to marry outside their position in life.-Americans don't have a clue how the English system works, but it sounds/looks like fun, so we want to participate in it, and if we have the money for it, they will let us do it.-American women in the 1800s had no rights, were treated like children, and in some cases were downright silly, probably because they were expected to be. It certainly didn't pay for them to have brains, or values not appreciated by their families, and try to use them.I tried very hard to find characters that I could relate to or care about.

In this case, Wharton did not live to write the ending, and the screenwriter let one of the young women off at the last minute.What's good: the scenery and the photography.  Different English country houses from the usual are used and they are impressive.  The music is good.  The costumes?  I'll take their word for that.What's not so good: the story consists of only 3 to 5 steps.  This is not a Jane Austen story in which events continue to happen and there are even some surprises along the way.  In this movie, three (or four) young girls frolic around in America, go to England, land English gentlemen and get crushed by English social machinery.The characters: all three girls are vivacious at first.  That is all we ever know about them.  Even with five hours to work with, the screenwriter did not manage to make any of these young women into a person.  This is not George Eliot, in which the characters are complex and interesting individuals even when they live dull lives.  If you couldn't see these girls, you couldn't tell them apart.  It took me three hours to learn to remember their names (and I still can't remember the name of the fourth character).  Except for the Sorvino character (whose name I still can't remember), none of the girls had any gumption, as Allison Eliott herself said in the documentary.Bottom line: if you really like anything with costumes, etc., then see this movie; but borrow it or rent it because you're never going to watch it a second time.",3,three buccaneers get busted,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,1686,"['As', 'soon', 'know', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'story', 'know', 'nice', 'innocent', 'girl', 'girls', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'machinery', 'society', 'slowly', 'inexorably', 'ground', 'down', 'case', 'Wharton', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'write', 'ending', 'screenwriter', 'let', 'one', 'young', 'women', 'off', 'last', 'minute.What', 'good', 'scenery', 'photography', 'Different', 'English', 'country', 'houses', 'usual', 'are', 'used', 'are', 'impressive', 'music', 'good', 'costumes', ""'ll"", 'take', 'word', 'that.What', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'story', 'only', '3', '5', 'steps', 'not', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'story', 'events', 'continue', 'happen', 'are', 'even', 'surprises', 'way', 'movie', 'three', 'four', 'young', 'girls', 'frolic', 'America', 'go', 'England', 'land', 'English', 'gentlemen', 'get', 'crushed', 'English', 'social', 'machinery.The', 'characters', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'vivacious', 'first', 'ever', 'know', 'Even', 'five', 'hours', 'work', 'screenwriter', 'did', 'not', 'manage', 'make', 'young', 'women', 'person', 'not', 'George', 'Eliot', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'interesting', 'individuals', 'even', 'when', 'live', 'dull', 'lives', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'girls', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'apart', 'took', 'three', 'hours', 'learn', 'remember', 'names', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'fourth', 'character', 'Sorvino', 'character', 'name', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'none', 'girls', 'had', 'gumption', 'Allison', 'Eliott', 'said', 'documentary.Bottom', 'line', 'really', 'anything', 'costumes', 'etc.', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'borrow', 'rent', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",The Buccaneers VHS

390904,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,630394325X,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","Based on Edith Wharton's final uncompleted novel, THE BUCCANEERS is one of the most popular BBC miniseries.  An ambitious British/American coproduction, this 1995 miniseries sadly cuts down on the characters depicted in the original novel, but finally provides the conclusion which (though not written by the author herself) I'm sure Wharton would have approved.The term ""Buccaneers"" was given to the American heiresses who travelled to England in the late 19th Century with hopes of marrying into the British aristocracy.  Precious few of these marriages were true ""love matches"", and in most cases the men were mostly interested in investing their wives' considerable allowances into propping up their own dwindling fortunes and crumbling estates.  Our story concerns four such ""Buccaneers"".The St. George sisters Nan (Carla Gugino), Virginia (Alison Elliott) and their two best friends Lizzy Elmsworth (Rya Kihlstedt) and Conchita Closson (Mira Sorvino) are all vivacious young heiresses in America, full of adventure and daring, but encountering difficulties in meeting eligible young men.  When Nan's new British governess Miss Laura Testvalley (Cherie Lunghi) suggests to the St. George's that their girls would greatly benefit from a trip to England and a chance to experience their first London ""Season"", the family sets sail on what will turn out to be a trip which will alter the lives of all concerned.Brazilian firecracker Conchita is the first to claim victory when she nabs notorious rake Lord Richard Marabel (Ronan Vibert), and Virginia follows suit when she charms her way into the same family and marries Lord Seadown (Mark Tandy), despite the presence of his long-standing mistress Idina Hatton (Jenny Agutter).  But it's Nan who makes the biggest splash when she is swept off her feet by Julius Folyat, the Duke of Trevennick (James Frain).  Blithely believing that she is about to step into her own real-life fairytale and despite the protestations of Miss Testvalley that she's not ready to settle down after just one romance, Nan's impulsive marriage rapidly turns into a nightmare when she discovers the true nature of her husband, less than equipped to be the man of her dreams, and a household where she is treated more like some treasured china doll than a wife.  Nan is not-too-subtly loved from afar by Julius' friend, politician Guy Thwaite (Greg Wise), but how can their love survive in a time when money and property are valued over everything else?THE BUCCANEERS was Edith Wharton's stinging indictment on the American upper-classes to which she belonged but was vocally critical of.  In the story, the girls' single-minded quests for station and titles bring them nothing but unhappiness, as their husbands reign in their desires and take away any possible freedom.  Just like in real life, there are few 'happy' endings, but the drama along the way will prove addictive viewing for lovers of this kind of lush, plush period drama.This DVD presents the miniseries as it originally aired (5 episodes), although there is also a Dutch DVD edition (fully licensed from the BBC) which has re-edited the series into 6 episodes.",4,two societies collide in Edith Wharton's final work,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,3155,"['Based', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'final', 'uncompleted', 'novel', 'BUCCANEERS', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'ambitious', 'British/American', 'coproduction', '1995', 'miniseries', 'sadly', 'cuts', 'down', 'characters', 'depicted', 'original', 'novel', 'finally', 'conclusion', 'not', 'written', 'author', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Wharton', 'would', 'have', 'approved.The', 'term', 'Buccaneers', 'was', 'given', 'American', 'heiresses', 'who', 'travelled', 'England', 'late', '19th', 'Century', 'hopes', 'marrying', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'Precious', 'few', 'marriages', 'were', 'true', 'love', 'matches', 'most', 'cases', 'men', 'were', 'mostly', 'interested', 'investing', 'wives', 'considerable', 'allowances', 'propping', 'up', 'own', 'dwindling', 'fortunes', 'crumbling', 'estates', 'story', 'concerns', 'four', 'such', 'Buccaneers', '.The', 'St.', 'George', 'sisters', 'Nan', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'Virginia', 'Alison', 'Elliott', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Lizzy', 'Elmsworth', 'Rya', 'Kihlstedt', 'Conchita', 'Closson', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'are', 'vivacious', 'young', 'heiresses', 'America', 'full', 'adventure', 'daring', 'encountering', 'difficulties', 'meeting', 'eligible', 'young', 'men', 'When', 'Nan', 'new', 'British', 'governess', 'Miss', 'Laura', 'Testvalley', 'Cherie', 'Lunghi', 'St.', 'George', 'girls', 'would', 'greatly', 'benefit', 'trip', 'England', 'chance', 'experience', 'first', 'London', 'Season', 'family', 'sail', 'what', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'trip', 'will', 'alter', 'lives', 'concerned.Brazilian', 'firecracker', 'Conchita', 'first', 'claim', 'victory', 'when', 'nabs', 'notorious', 'rake', 'Lord', 'Richard', 'Marabel', 'Ronan', 'Vibert', 'Virginia', 'suit', 'when', 'way', 'same', 'family', 'marries', 'Lord', 'Seadown', 'Mark', 'Tandy', 'presence', 'long-standing', 'mistress', 'Idina', 'Hatton', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'Nan', 'who', 'biggest', 'splash', 'when', 'swept', 'feet', 'Julius', 'Folyat', 'Duke', 'Trevennick', 'James', 'Frain', 'Blithely', 'believing', 'step', 'own', 'real-life', 'fairytale', 'protestations', 'Miss', 'Testvalley', 'not', 'ready', 'settle', 'down', 'just', 'one', 'romance', 'Nan', 'impulsive', 'marriage', 'rapidly', 'nightmare', 'when', 'true', 'nature', 'husband', 'less', 'equipped', 'be', 'man', 'dreams', 'household', 'where', 'treated', 'more', 'treasured', 'china', 'doll', 'wife', 'Nan', 'not-too-subtly', 'loved', 'afar', 'Julius', 'friend', 'politician', 'Guy', 'Thwaite', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'how', 'can', 'love', 'survive', 'time', 'when', 'money', 'property', 'are', 'valued', 'everything', 'else', 'BUCCANEERS', 'was', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'stinging', 'indictment', 'American', 'upper-classes', 'belonged', 'was', 'vocally', 'critical', 'story', 'girls', 'single-minded', 'quests', 'station', 'titles', 'bring', 'nothing', 'unhappiness', 'husbands', 'reign', 'desires', 'take', 'away', 'possible', 'freedom', 'Just', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'few', ""'happy"", 'endings', 'drama', 'way', 'will', 'prove', 'addictive', 'viewing', 'lovers', 'kind', 'lush', 'plush', 'period', 'drama.This', 'DVD', 'miniseries', 'originally', 'aired', '5', 'episodes', 'also', 'Dutch', 'DVD', 'edition', 'fully', 'licensed', 'BBC', 're-edited', 'series', '6', 'episodes']",The Buccaneers VHS

The script for this mini-series is so leaky that viewers may well discover difficulty in navigating the storyline.  They most assuredly must wonder at characters' rash actions, given that little or no motivational ballast is provided for so many of their abrupt and senseless decisions.  Worse, the plot consistently lurches from one pivotal event to the next, depriving the audience of empathetic anxiety and suspense.  Much of the presentation is like a tableau in which a sequence of scenes is splashed before the viewers' gaze.  One thus learns that a character did this or that, but not why.  Indeed, character development is all but nonexistent.  A viewer's head might initially swim in struggling to even differentiate one buccaneer from the next, as the girls spend more time giggling and spinning about than enriching the audience with knowledge of their personalities.  When someone in the story does something unusual, the audience is simply left at sea as to incentive.  An English noble weds an American with whom he shares a genuine friendship and affection.  Then it's made known that he has failed to consummate the marriage.  He playfully ravishes his wife.  She seems satisfied.  Then she spurns him.  He tries to bribe her into bed.  Then he beds a man.

This review starts with the positives, the cast, and then ends with the negative, primarily a screen play that diverts too much from the intentions of Edith Wharton.Carla Gugino, from the film Watchmen, and Alison Elliott, from the film Wings of the Dove, play the St. George sisters - the characters around which the entire film revolves. Alison Elliott is an incredible beauty. Their adolescent friends are Conchita Closson, played by Mira Sorvino, and Lizzy Elmsworth, played by Rya Kihlstedt.  These young women have fates that rise and fall as the leave America and seek social status in England. The film seeks to show the girls as silly playmates, innocent and naive, But the actresses are too mature for the yard games these girls play in the first quarter of the film.There are three outstanding performances from other actions including Cherie Lunghi as governess Laura Testvalley, Greg Wise as Guy Thwaite, and James Frain as Julius Folyat. Frain was familiar to me as the sadistic vampire Franklin Mott in True Blood and his acting range is outstanding. Greg Wise is so pretty he competes with the beautiful actresses in the film.The film diverts from Edith Wharton's bleak and realistic view of money's ability to corrupt and social consequences for independent actions and thought. The screen play seems to have decreased the intensity of the consequences for the bad choices some of these young women make. It is an entertaining film but it does not capture Wharton's astute insights into the restrictions of society upon women and the consequences for poor decisions.",4,Great actors but a watered down screenplay,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,1773,"['entertaining', 'film', 'impressive', 'settings', 'costumes', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'bear', 'mentioning', 'review', 'positives', 'cast', 'then', 'negative', 'primarily', 'screen', 'play', 'too', 'much', 'intentions', 'Edith', 'Wharton.Carla', 'Gugino', 'film', 'Watchmen', 'Alison', 'Elliott', 'film', 'Wings', 'Dove', 'play', 'St.', 'George', 'sisters', 'characters', 'entire', 'film', 'revolves', 'Alison', 'Elliott', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'adolescent', 'friends', 'are', 'Conchita', 'Closson', 'played', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Lizzy', 'Elmsworth', 'played', 'Rya', 'Kihlstedt', 'young', 'women', 'have', 'fates', 'rise', 'fall', 'leave', 'America', 'seek', 'social', 'status', 'England', 'film', 'show', 'girls', 'silly', 'playmates', 'innocent', 'naive', 'actresses', 'are', 'too', 'mature', 'yard', 'games', 'girls', 'play', 'first', 'quarter', 'film.There', 'are', 'three', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'other', 'actions', 'including', 'Cherie', 'Lunghi', 'governess', 'Laura', 'Testvalley', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'Guy', 'Thwaite', 'James', 'Frain', 'Julius', 'Folyat', 'Frain', 'was', 'familiar', 'sadistic', 'vampire', 'Franklin', 'Mott', 'True', 'Blood', 'acting', 'range', 'outstanding', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'so', 'pretty', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'film.The', 'film', 'diverts', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'bleak', 'realistic', 'view', 'money', 'ability', 'corrupt', 'social', 'consequences', 'independent', 'actions', 'thought', 'screen', 'play', 'have', 'decreased', 'intensity', 'consequences', 'bad', 'choices', 'young', 'women', 'make', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'capture', 'Wharton', 'astute', 'insights', 'restrictions', 'society', 'women', 'consequences', 'poor', 'decisions']",The Buccaneers VHS

390912,A1T17LMQABMBN5,630394325X,CoffeeGurl,"[16, 18]","I thought it was time to put the North and South DVD down and watch another BBC period drama.  I picked The Buccaneers because I'm a big fan of Edith Wharton and I love the novel (despite the fact that Wharton died before she could finish it).  The BBC adaptation, despite being filled with more than a little Victorian melodrama, is an enjoyable adaptation and I watched all five episodes in two nights.  Annabelle (also known as Nan) and Virginia St. George are two young ladies shunned by New York society because of their new money status.  So they move to New England to try their luck there.  Nan and Virginia, together with good friend Lizzy Elmsworth, meet a spirited Brazilian called Conchita Closson (Mira Sorvino) and have a great time smoking, drinking and passing off as English aristocrats in order to attend a ball.  Nan is given an English governess, Laura Testvalley, and she becomes Nan's most trusted confidante.  Unable to fit into Newport society, the girls move to England after Laura suggests a London season.  There Nan and her friends experience the differences between the American and English societies, the difference between the world of trading and the monarchy, and how marriage with English aristocrats isn't the fairy tale life they'd thought it would be.I love the backdrop of the 1870s, how the new ways of the world clash with the old ones, how fast science is advancing and how the British monarchy is slowly coming to a standstill.  Those are some rather insightful parts of this mini-series.  The book explores this more than the series adaptation, but they illustrate some insights without losing focus of the central storylines.  The actors are all wonderful.  I'd never seen any of them before except for Sorvino, but they're a talented lot.  James Frain is great as the Duke of Trevenick.  He showed a great deal of depth and dimensions and made the character complex and compelling.  I also liked Ronan Vibert as Lord Richard.  Cherie Lunghi as the governess and Carla Gugino as Nan are great as well.  All of the stories centered on the girls' marriages and how they cope with the harsh realities of their callous husbands are quite touching if kind of depressing at times.  Nan's marriage to the duke is especially heartwrenching and her forbidden love for up-and-coming politician Guy Thwaite (Greg Wise) is romantic in a bittersweet kind of way.  The one thing I have against this series is that some scenes were a little too melodramatic and theatrical for my taste.  Why does overacting seem like a prerequisite in a Victorian drama?  And the ending doesn't seem like something Edith Wharton would have written.  But I'm glad the ending had been written this way, for it is bittersweet rather than tragic.  All in all, The Buccaneers is a beautiful production. The wardrobe is impressive.  The train skirts from the 1870s are gorgeous, a real eyeful for costume drama fans.  And there are some truly wonderful scenes in this series.  I especially love the parts where Nan gets lost in the artwork, especially those beautiful paintings in her apartments at the Trevenick estate.  This series is almost as fascinating to me as North and South and Richard Armitage (sigh), and the DVD is a great investment, the best ten bucks I've ever spent!

390919,A29VKODW4R5U7W,630394325X,dooby,"[142, 150]","This is a version of Edith Wharton's last unfinished novel as completed by the BBC screenwriter Maggie Wadey. It was filmed barely 2 years after the first complete version of the novel was published in 1993 (Completed by Marion Mainwaring). It chronicles a very different time (1870s) when class distinctions were clearly marked and the nouveau riche found themselves curtly excluded from the ""old money"" aristocracy of 19th century America. The story traces the lives of 4 girls from such families who finding themselves rejected in the land of their birth, travel to England to try their charms and new found wealth on the titled aristocracy of the old country. How they fare and the breaking of their illusions form the meat of the story. One reviewer commented on the shallowness and blandness of the characters, of not being able to tell the girls apart. Some viewers may even look at these girls as twittering airheads. This is in part Wharton's doing. Edith Wharton was no admirer of the American upper class. She belonged to it, she experienced it first hand and she despised it and made it evident in her books. Wharton constantly pointed out her society's ignorance, provincialism and prissy narrow-mindedness. None of the girls here really ends up living happily ever after. One of the reviewers here stated that in the absence of Wharton's own ending, the BBC screenwriter has let one of the girls off at the end. But I tend to disagree. Even the heroine Annabelle's running away with the man she loves (supposedly a happy ending) is tinged with the public scandal of adultery, the loss of her titles and privileges, and exile to the other side of the world (Durban, South Africa). This is definitely not what any of the girls would have wanted. Everybody just ends up making compromises and settling for second best. But then such is life.As usual with the BBC, this is a beautiful production, with gorgeous costumes and sets, filmed at various locations in the English countryside as well as in Newport, Rhode Island which stands in for 19th century America.The DVD transfer is a rather more questionable affair. According to IMDb, Buccaneers was shot on 16mm film. In America, most TV shows are shot on standard 35mm, 16mm film being used usually for cheaper productions, especially sitcoms and series whose future is in doubt. The BBC alas is publicly funded and doesn't have quite the deep pockets of competing American studios, so many of even its major productions are on 16mm. The critically acclaimed ""Brideshead Revisited"" immediately springs to mind. For a 16mm film, this actually looks pretty good with strong, vibrant colours, rich blacks and just a slight amount of graininess which imparts a certain softness to the picture, much what you would expect from a 16mm print. It actually looks better than ""Brideshead"" does on DVD. What is disturbing is the rather odd (1.50:1) aspect ratio presented here. (Yes, I actually popped it into the PC to measure it.) Buccaneers is, I believe, supposed to be in 1.66:1 widescreen. The 1.50:1 aspect ratio means that it has either been cropped or it has had its mattes removed. Either way, it has been modified. Because of the odd ratio it has to be letterboxed into a 4:3 frame. It may matter only to a handful of cinephiles or videophiles but I do wish video companies would take more care in transferring their shows onto discs. Sound is in 2.0 Stereo and dialogue is always clear and distinct.",4,Wharton's last unfinished novel as completed by BBC's Maggie Wadey...

The movie, however, was a vast disapointment. A few of the actors chosen to play the parts were wrong: their voices, their mannerisms, and the way they played the character. The main character that comes to mind is that of Mrs. St George. Where in the book she comes across as a long suffering, social climbing, yet weak-minded matron, in this movie, she comes across as an air-headed, pampered society wife.I was also disappointed with the way the characters of Idina, Seadon, the duke and a few others were portrayed--their characterizations were changed from how they were in the book, and not for the better. I feel as though attention was spent trying to create sympathy for characters that didn't need it, nor should have been sympathized with. This story is about Nan, and then Virginia, Lizzy & Conchita, and to an extent, Laura Testvalley.The locations were vibrant and pretty, and while the costumes were somewhat accurate(fashion major speaking here), they looked a trifle cheap in comparison to the 1995 Pride & Prejudice movie, and even cheaper compared to 1997's Titanic. Costumes are my main disappointment with this period movie--they were bot sumptuous and dazzling.But if you liked to book and are prepared to ignore some of the liberties taken with the plot and the characters, this is an entertaining movie. But warning--this is not Jane Austen territory. No light, bucolic comedy of manners with happy endings here.

The houses are also completely top of the line: Castle Howard in Yorkshire, the most dramatic house in England, is used for Longlands, the home of the Duke of Trevenick. But while visually this is a rare feast, dramatically ""The Bucccaneers"" is not quite all it should be. Edith Wharton started the unfinished novel on which it is based with an idea very much like her best social comedies: if wealthy nouveau riche American beauties could not make it into Old New York society, why not try to make it into the top of the British aristocracy by providing large dowries? Girls like Consuelo Vanderbilt and the wealthy Langhorne sisters of Virginia (on whom Wharton based her St. George sisters) did exactly that; but marrying into such position did not guarantee happiness. Nor in this miniseries, unfortunately, does it always provide much narrative excitement: the direction is not simply langurous but incredibly slowly-paced, and most of the acting is only passable, with a few striking exceptions (such as Jenny Agutter, who is very fine as the miserable mistress to Lord Seadown).

Aside from the terrible, awful acting, dreadful and annoying laughter, the screenplay eliminates the fifth Buccaneer - key to a crucial political twist later in the novel.The addition of closeted abortion, syphilis, homosexuality and marital rape is heavy-handed and excessively 20th century - completely changing the reasons for Annabelle's dissatisfaction with her new wifely role/duties into something that modern American audiences would find horrifying.So many roles were mis-cast - Mira Sorvino as Conchita was one of the biggest - she was a fair auburn/red-head in the book. Changing the name of Tintagel to Trevenick was confusing - but the Duke was described as pretty much the opposite in appearance as the actor who portrayed him.

390945,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,630394325X,Joanna Daneman,"[1, 1]","""The Buccanneers"" is based on Edith Wharton's last and unfinished novel, a story of rich American girls marrying English aristocracy. As in any arrangement of a marriage, where love is not the primary motivation, there are trade-offs. In some cases, the trade-offs are too enormous to handle; Duchess Annabelle is really in love with another man, and her immaturity and willfulness lead her to create a scandal.This series is beautifully cast and acted; the sets are magnificent as are the costumes. In particular, I enjoyed Jenny Agutter, Mira Sorvino and Cherie Lunghi. (Agutter plays the cast-off mistress of Lord Brightlingsea. Her depiction of depression is spot-on. She's rarely dressed in more than a negligee or housecoat, she reclines languidly on any couch or hammock, drinks to excess.)The problem I have with some of the script is that Duke Julius is supposed to be kind of a dud (sexually ambiguous) but he is written with so much sympathy, along with the Dowager Duchess (his mother), who patiently tries to explain the duties of a duchess to Annabelle, that instead of feeling sorry for Annabelle, I felt more sorry for her husband and mother-in-law, who got a woman who just didn't want to play the game she signed up for (kind of a Princess Diana, in a way.) I think Annabelle was not given enough to make her seem more than a spoiled little girl who tantrums when things are not a fairytale.The five episodes tell the story, but somehow I wanted more. Is that because the book itself was finished after Wharton's death? Or is it that this series is somewhat lacking?

Shunned by the old established families of the time, the girls travel to England for a ""London season.""  All of the girls are soon married into the British aristocracy.  But, be warned, this is not a romance.Edith Wharton was born in 1862 to a wealthy New York family.  She knew the wealthy and powerful of the age.  She was a part of upper class American society but also a harsh critic of it.  Her novels illustrate the provincialism, elitism, ignorance and bigotry of the period.  Wharton won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature for her novel The Age of Innocence, in 1921.  She was the first woman to win the award.Wharton died on August 11, 1937 with this novel incomplete.  The story was published the next year as it stood when she died.  It was not until 1993 that Marion Mainwaring was commissioned to complete the story and two years later the BBC produced this miniseries based upon the novel and Mainwaring completion.Recommendation:  I certainly recommend The Buccaneers as a complex and interesting tale of the period, but don't expect everyone to live happily ever after.Finally, if American heiresses crossing the Atlantic to marry into the British aristocracy fascinates you I recommend, To Marry an English Lord by Gail MacColl and Carol Wallace as an entertaining history of this Victorian era phenomena.Kyle Pratt",4,Excellent Story but not a Romance,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,1522,"['BBC', 'miniseries', 'adapted', 'last', 'incomplete', 'novel', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'lives', 'four', 'American', 'girls', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'new', 'rich', 'late', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'Shunned', 'old', 'established', 'families', 'time', 'girls', 'travel', 'England', 'London', 'season', 'girls', 'are', 'soon', 'married', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'romance.Edith', 'Wharton', 'was', 'born', '1862', 'wealthy', 'New', 'York', 'family', 'knew', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'age', 'was', 'part', 'upper', 'class', 'American', 'society', 'also', 'harsh', 'critic', 'novels', 'illustrate', 'provincialism', 'elitism', 'ignorance', 'bigotry', 'period', 'Wharton', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Literature', 'novel', 'Age', 'Innocence', '1921', 'was', 'first', 'woman', 'win', 'award.Wharton', 'died', 'August', '11', '1937', 'novel', 'incomplete', 'story', 'was', 'published', 'next', 'year', 'stood', 'when', 'died', 'was', 'not', '1993', 'Marion', 'Mainwaring', 'was', 'commissioned', 'complete', 'story', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'BBC', 'produced', 'miniseries', 'based', 'novel', 'Mainwaring', 'completion.Recommendation', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'Buccaneers', 'complex', 'interesting', 'tale', 'period', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'everyone', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Finally', 'American', 'heiresses', 'crossing', 'Atlantic', 'marry', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'recommend', 'Marry', 'English', 'Lord', 'Gail', 'MacColl', 'Carol', 'Wallace', 'entertaining', 'history', 'Victorian', 'era', 'phenomena.Kyle', 'Pratt']",The Buccaneers VHS

For that alone, it is worth watching.  The characters are portrayed with the restrained exceptional truth of a good ensemble performance with adherence to the nature of the times.

I am sure many others out there are breathing a sigh of relief as one of the most engaging costume dramas ever made is finally coming to dvd.My sister and I adore this mini-series which was shown in Masterpiece Theater many years ago. Anyone who enjoys turn-of-the-century films such as The Age of Innocence, House of Mirth, A Room With A View and Howard's End or stories of the Astors and Vanderbilts will find themselves enraptured with this tale of 4 beautiful American women who find themselves being courted by sons of the British nobility.At the center of the story are Nan (Carla Gugino) and Virginia St. George (Alison Eliott), and their friends Conchita Closson (Mira Sorvino) and Lizzy Elmsworth (Rya Kihlstedt) - four young women living in turn-of-the-century America, when social status and wealth were the most important considerations in a woman's life (these were the days of the Astors and Vanderbilts, after all). Early in the story we find Conchita married to Lord Marable (Ronan Vibert) and begins her new life with the English nobility. Spurned in Newport and New York social circles because they are considered ""new money,"" Nan, Virginia and Lizzy travel to England to visit Conchita and hopefully try their luck there. With the help of two enterprising older women, they soon become the toast of the town and are courted by several handsome and eligible young men. Virginia and Lizzy vie for the attentions of Lord Seadown (Mark Tandy), an enigmatic nobleman who is entangled in a scandalous relationship with an older woman (Jenny Agutter). Nan is pursued by the impoverished but ambitious Guy Thwaite (Greg Wise from ""Sense and Sensibility"") and the wealthy and reserved Julius (James Frain from ""Elizabeth""), the Duke of Trevenick. Lizzy is pursued by the common yet enterprising parliament member, Hector Robinson (Richard Huw). Courtships and marriages inevitably take place and the young ladies soon realize that British aristocratic life isn't always what it seems.The mini-series offers beautiful scenery and costumes, great acting from members of the cast (including veterans Cherie Lunghi, Jenny Agutter, Michael Kitchen and Rosemary Leach) and a thoroughly engaging story. I loved the fantastic mansions, palaces and castles in Newport and England alike and the wonderful intertwining of the American and British sensibilities in the plot. It has ""one foot in America and another foot in England,"" as Masterpiece Theater narrator Russell Baker aptly explains.Along with North & South, Pride & Prejudice and Wives & Daughters (all BBC produced, incidentally), The Buccaneers is one of my favorite period dramas  and holds a special place in my film library.

It's the story of four ""nouveau riche"" young ladies from New York, who are shunned by traditionalist society, and set out to England to perhaps win-by love or by their fortunes-better circumstances for themselves and their families. But all that glitters is not gold; and these four different women, childhood friends - will learn that life is not always a gilded path as they thought their lives would be. That childhood dreams of romance can be dashed. That circumstances test the bonds of friendship. They would in fact, have some growing to do. And learning. And in doing this, they would come to realize their own true characters.

And her books reflected her knowledge of how that society lived. Unfortunately, she passed away before completing this novel, but this mini-series has been adapted per the notes she left behind. Edith Wharton was not Jane Austen. Her novels present more true to life situations and are peopled with individuals who are more realistic.In ""The Bucaneers,"" four young ladies whose families are attempting to break into high society are not achieving the success their families had hoped for: courtship and marriages with the best of society. In desperation, Mrs. St. George (mother to 2 of the girls - Virginia and Nan) send her daughters to England in hopes of securing their position in society and possibily making good marriages there. One of the 4 girls, Conchita Closson, does manage to marry an British aristocrat. The final girl, Lizzy Elmsworth, eventually ends up in England.The mini-series revolves around the girls experience with courtship and ultimate marriages, and the fact of what must be dealt with when one marries for social position instead of love. And how they eventually because part of that upper society their families had always wanted for them - and at what sacrifice.There was a time when women had few choices in life, and to go against those choices was to be ostracized and abandoned by friends and family. It wasn't merely a decision whether to be happy - it was decision of survival. And this story shows that very well. It is said that Ms. Wharton used Consuelo Vanderbilt as her inspiration for Conchita Closson, and Lady Randolph Churchill as her inspiration for Lizzy Elmsworth. Who knows?This story is not all rainbows and butterflies. But it allows the viewer to think on where women have been, and where they have come, and if they would have made the same decisions had they been in the same situation.The acting is a little bit to be desired, but overall, the scenery, the costumes, and the storyline are wonderful.

Ladies, this movie has NONE.  The only good looking man in this series barely makes an appearance and in every scene has such a silly mustache as to be unswoonworthy.Everything goes wrong for these girls.

The tale is narrated by the faithful, well wishing, free but lonely, governess(Cherie Lunghi) of the two sisters from the the group of ""buccaneers"".Indeed, this is one of the most pretty costume pieces one will ever see: incredible dresses and hairdos, amazing homes and countrysides, most of it filmed in England.  Each shot captures some mood or romantic longing.  Impressive.The director, Philip Saville(The Gospel of John) does a fine job with so many interlacing storylines going on, and the actors, for the most part, do quite well.  Carla Gugino carries the brunt of the work and the abuse as the young, naive but soon to mature debutante.  Jenny Agutter is great as an aging, tortured, long suffering mistress.  James Frain(The Count of Monte Cristo) as the creepy Duke after the affections of the vulnerable sister, Gugino's character.My issue with this film is the writing which vacillates between superb, five star stuff to ugh!, ""I can't believe how dumb!"" , at times quite painfully so. I kept asking myself, ""Why?""There's no frank nudity or severe language; however, there are very adult themes of abuse, rape, deceitfulness, disease, homosexuality, sleeping around and general tomfoolery.  Nothing's shown for gratuity's sake.They tie it all together nicely at the end with some happiness provided.  Whew!  It's interesting.  I'd say watch at least the first full episode or so before deciding on whether it's your cup of tea, so to speak, or not.

As a result, I was somewhat annoyed by the characters' dissatisfaction with their choices by the 4th episode.

391001,A3R5AFKW4FP0U5,630394325X,SusieQ,"[2, 2]","I enjoyed this production.  The acting is high quality - Mira Sorvino's performance is exceptionally so; also Cherie Lunghi and Jenny Agutter's, and Connie Booth in a smaller supporting turn.  Michael Kitchen and Greg Wise are excellent as the outsider-Englishman and his ambitious son - the son who won't conform to his father's dreams.I thought the screenwriters kept a great deal of accuracy in the depiction of how American heiresses were married off into British aristocratic society - and how they were treated, afterward.  In other words, the American girl's money was warmly welcomed, but the girl was someone to be patronized as an ""American mongrel"" by her mother- and sister-in-laws; at least, until she produced an heir and a spare, and perhaps gained a little power over her life thereby.  The writing here might not be strictly Wharton-by-the-book (and THE BUCCANEERS is something of a mongrel Wharton anyway, having been finished by another author), but Wharton based these particular young women and their lives on real people (such as Jennie Jerome and Consuelo, Duchess of Manchester), and that genuine true-life detail and quality has been kept.  The attitude of the Duchess (Nan's mother-in-law) toward Nan, and all of Nan's difficulties and emotions, are exactly right, and yet the Duchess's backstory, when we learn it, makes us pity her too - briefly.  It's skillful, and enjoyable, when ALL the characters, even the less instantly sympathetic ones, are created with a touch of understanding and pity.My problem with the production is a kind of abruptness that occurs too frequently.  Scenes end suddenly, and aren't followed up (for example, Julius makes a marriage proposal to Nan - and in the next scene they're married & returning from their honeymoon).  Lizzie Ellsworth's marriage isn't given as full a treatment as the other 'Buccaneers', which disappointed me.  She marries an interesting character - Hector Robinson, the non-genteel, social-climbing MP, but their relationship is given short shrift.  The viewer is given more in-depth regarding Conchita's and Virginia's marriages, but there again, there is stop/start abruptness and gaps in their stories.  Really the only Buccaneer I could say we get to ""know"" is Nan St. George, because her marriage is given the fullest attention; especially the last two episodes.  I liked knowing all about Nan, but I also wanted more about the others.While THE BUCCANEERS doesn't have the directorial smoothness and narrative flow of most BBC adaptations, the story isn't boring (as some reviewers have said).  It's strange to me how anyone who purchased this DVD (and presumably, read something about its content first) could expect a sparkling-sunny Jane Austen-style adaptation, such as that it shall be nameless Regency tale where a handsome rich man marries a pretty, witty poor girl with four sisters, and all the loose ends are tied up in the end.  Even though the Bennett sisters had to marry money, there was a lightness about their search for married happiness.  THE BUCCANEERS is grittier - it's mid-Victorian England, and the beginning of the end for the aristocratic landed class (something that only Hector Robinson sees, even as he aspires to join it).  The real-life aristocratic landowners wanted money to keep up their way of life; American heiresses had the money, and many were married off without love for the sake of a title.  Many of the fictional British characters portrayed here are craven; are users; are manipulative and unattractive.  The young and naive Americans had to toughen up and adapt to British aristocratic ways, as Virginia and Conchita do - or not, in the case of Nan.  This story struck me as an accurate representation of what happened to many rich young American women, at least from what I've read about 19th century Anglo-American marriages.I have to respond to those reviewers who complained about how these women lacked 'gumption', or said that they sat around 'whining' about their fates.  Anyone who watches this DVD should remember that in this time period, even wealthy young women weren't well educated (only by a governess, if she was lucky) and were raised with the view that marriage was their only future.  A woman became a man's property upon marriage, with her money belonging solely to him.  (If she was lucky, as Jennie Jerome was, her American father might insist on at least a part of it remaining in her control.  But that didn't happen often.)  One also has to remember that they barely knew their husbands, let alone that marrying a British Lord would entail sacrificing their American heritage and citizenship to take on a British one, and taking on a totally unknown, cliquish-aristocratic territory at that.But the bottom line is, if I personally had it to do over again, I probably wouldn't buy the DVD, but would borrow it from the local library.  Although it's a good story, and occasionally a very good, and always well-acted story, it's not quite a keeper, due to the somewhat choppy way the multi-narrative was handled.",3,3.5

Many ""old money"" families like the Vanderbilt's and Astor's began to look to England to secure English titles to add to their prestige. Whereas, the ""new moneyed"" Americans denied admittance into New York society, also looked to England for a title and acceptance. On the other hand, where England was still a colonial power with extreme amounts of wealth in the hands of a few landed gentry, many of these landed English families were cash poor; thus paving the way for marriage alliances to be formed across the Atlantic.The Story:Edith Wharton's unfinished novel, The Buccaneers takes place within these historical times, and portrays the hazards that develop when socially driven families manipulate and connive young minds through the use of duty, honor, title and wealth.This BBC production is splendidly done, with grand costumes of the day, beautiful locations, and strong performances by the cast. One slight drawback is that several key characters seem to simply fade away within the story, so that the emotional investment is oddly lost and dismissed for three of the four girls halfway through the series.The ending developed from Wharton's notes is satisfying, at the same time that it is unsettling. For true to the time, women's choices were difficult, and often crushing. Surprisingly, you may find that you'll think on this story long afterwards.",4,Illuminates 1870's Marriage Alliances Between American & English Families,1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,1470,"['Backdrop', 'latter', 'half', '1800', 'America', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'rising', 'industrial', 'financial', 'giant', 'Many', 'old', 'money', 'families', 'Vanderbilt', 'Astor', 'began', 'look', 'England', 'secure', 'English', 'titles', 'add', 'prestige', 'Whereas', 'new', 'moneyed', 'Americans', 'denied', 'admittance', 'New', 'York', 'society', 'also', 'looked', 'England', 'title', 'acceptance', 'other', 'hand', 'where', 'England', 'was', 'still', 'colonial', 'power', 'extreme', 'amounts', 'wealth', 'hands', 'few', 'landed', 'gentry', 'many', 'landed', 'English', 'families', 'were', 'cash', 'poor', 'thus', 'paving', 'way', 'marriage', 'alliances', 'be', 'formed', 'Atlantic.The', 'Story', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'unfinished', 'novel', 'Buccaneers', 'place', 'historical', 'times', 'hazards', 'develop', 'when', 'socially', 'driven', 'families', 'manipulate', 'connive', 'young', 'minds', 'use', 'duty', 'honor', 'title', 'wealth.This', 'BBC', 'production', 'splendidly', 'done', 'grand', 'costumes', 'day', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'strong', 'performances', 'cast', 'One', 'slight', 'drawback', 'several', 'key', 'characters', 'seem', 'simply', 'fade', 'away', 'story', 'emotional', 'investment', 'oddly', 'lost', 'dismissed', 'three', 'four', 'girls', 'halfway', 'series.The', 'ending', 'developed', 'Wharton', 'notes', 'satisfying', 'same', 'time', 'unsettling', 'true', 'time', 'women', 'choices', 'were', 'difficult', 'often', 'crushing', 'Surprisingly', 'may', 'find', ""'ll"", 'think', 'story', 'long', 'afterwards']",The Buccaneers VHS

This version is a BBC miniseries which will take you an entire afternoon to watch but it's well worth the time.  Many surprises and unexpected twists and turns in this exciting story of 4 women entering English society as what of course the English term as classless uneducated American's.  Many unexpected occurances and as is always with Edith Wharton, sadness around a few corners that you don't expect.

Some of Wharton's works have been successfully adapted for the big screen such as The Age of Innocence [with Daniel Day Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer] and The House of Mirth [with Gillian Anderson]. In The Buccaneers, we follow the adventures of a group of nouveau riche aka ""New Rich"" American girls - sisters Annabelle/Nan[ Carla Gugino] and Virginia St James [Alison Elliott], Lizzy Elmsworth[Rya Kihlstedt], and Conchita Closson [Mira Sorvino]. Since their New Rich status bars them entry into the Old Rich high society of new York, they go off to England in search of well-connected husbands.The girls attract the attention of men of the English nobility who in some instances, have only prestigious titles to their names and not much else. All the girls get married but with the exception of Lizzy who makes a stable and happy marriage, the others end up being miserable with their choice of husbands. Conchita [Mira Sorvino] marries Lord Richard, a weak-willed alcoholic, Virginia marries Richard's brother Lord Seadown [Mark Tandy] who marries her only for her money, for he has a long-standing affair with an older woman [Jenny Agutter], and free-spirited Nan [Carla Gugino] settles for the Duke of Trevenick, though her heart belongs to Guy Thwaite [Greg Wise aka Mr Willoughby of Sense & Sensibility].""The Buccaneers"" is at heart the story of Nan, and her fight for the right to be her own person despite a calamitous marriage, and the restrictions that her position as Duchess of Trevenick imposes upon her. Carla Gugino shines in her role, and her transformation from an idealistic teenager into a mature, young woman who learns to deal with the harsh realities of life is very credibly done. The other noteworthy performance is of Nan's governess, Ms Test Valley[Cheri Lunghi], who portrays a woman who has had to fend for herself by working as a governess since she was 17, and at the age of 40, finds herself bemoaning the fate of women during her time, the inability to live their own lives the way they deem fit, and to not have the choice of loving whom they please.A brief note on the DVD - it seems that BBC Video has put The Buccaneers onto a single DVD with Side A containing 3 episodes, and Side B the remaining 2 episodes with an added feauturette about the production of the series. In all, the series itself runs to about 5 hrs.In conclusion, this is a well-made period drama that will appeal to fans of the genre, and has lush landscapes, not to mention sumptuous costumes and of course, fine acting by an ensemble cast.",4,An absorbing melodrama,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2685,"['review', ""'The"", 'Buccaneers', 'confined', 'screen', 'production', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'unfinished', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Wharton', 'works', 'have', 'been', 'successfully', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'such', 'Age', 'Innocence', '[', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', ']', 'House', 'Mirth', '[', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', ']', 'Buccaneers', 'follow', 'adventures', 'group', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'New', 'Rich', 'American', 'girls', 'sisters', 'Annabelle/Nan', '[', 'Carla', 'Gugino', ']', 'Virginia', 'St', 'James', '[', 'Alison', 'Elliott', ']', 'Lizzy', 'Elmsworth', '[', 'Rya', 'Kihlstedt', ']', 'Conchita', 'Closson', '[', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', ']', 'New', 'Rich', 'status', 'entry', 'Old', 'Rich', 'high', 'society', 'new', 'York', 'go', 'off', 'England', 'search', 'well-connected', 'husbands.The', 'girls', 'attract', 'attention', 'men', 'English', 'nobility', 'who', 'instances', 'have', 'only', 'prestigious', 'titles', 'names', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'girls', 'get', 'married', 'exception', 'Lizzy', 'who', 'stable', 'happy', 'marriage', 'others', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'miserable', 'choice', 'husbands', 'Conchita', '[', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', ']', 'marries', 'Lord', 'Richard', 'weak-willed', 'alcoholic', 'Virginia', 'Richard', 'brother', 'Lord', 'Seadown', '[', 'Mark', 'Tandy', ']', 'who', 'only', 'money', 'long-standing', 'affair', 'older', 'woman', '[', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', ']', 'free-spirited', 'Nan', '[', 'Carla', 'Gugino', ']', 'Duke', 'Trevenick', 'heart', 'Guy', 'Thwaite', '[', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'aka', 'Mr', 'Willoughby', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', ']', 'Buccaneers', 'heart', 'story', 'Nan', 'fight', 'right', 'be', 'own', 'person', 'calamitous', 'marriage', 'restrictions', 'position', 'Duchess', 'Trevenick', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'shines', 'role', 'transformation', 'idealistic', 'teenager', 'mature', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'deal', 'harsh', 'realities', 'life', 'very', 'credibly', 'done', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'performance', 'Nan', 'governess', 'Ms', 'Test', 'Valley', '[', 'Cheri', 'Lunghi', ']', 'who', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'fend', 'working', 'governess', 'was', '17', 'age', '40', 'bemoaning', 'fate', 'women', 'time', 'inability', 'live', 'own', 'way', 'deem', 'fit', 'not', 'have', 'choice', 'loving', 'whom', 'please.A', 'brief', 'note', 'DVD', 'BBC', 'Video', 'put', 'Buccaneers', 'single', 'DVD', 'Side', 'A', 'containing', '3', 'episodes', 'Side', 'B', 'remaining', '2', 'episodes', 'added', 'feauturette', 'production', 'series', 'series', '5', 'hrs.In', 'conclusion', 'well-made', 'period', 'drama', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'genre', 'lush', 'landscapes', 'not', 'mention', 'sumptuous', 'costumes', 'course', 'fine', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'cast']",The Buccaneers VHS
