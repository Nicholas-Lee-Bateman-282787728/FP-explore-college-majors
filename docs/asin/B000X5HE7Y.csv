1113343,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B000X5HE7Y,Anticlimacus,"[21, 23]","A girl (Eun-hye Yun) poses as a guy in order to get a job at a local coffee shop in this 17-hour miniseries.  The manager falls in love with her but suppresses his feelings since he thinks she's a man.  The mood is almost always lighthearted since the characters have a childish nature, and much of the comedy is simplistic slapstick.  The characters are very sloppy, with rather disgusting eating and living habits.  Eun-hye Yun carries the series, but some of the men were kinda creepy and the male lead was only so-so.  There is a healthy amount of cheesiness in the form of relationship development, but considering how I'd have fun doing the same activities, there's probably little to complain about.  The script is unambitious (even a bit weak) and the final episode seemed rushed.  Still, this is a unique experience with great pacing and some unorthodox elements due to the uni-sex set-up. An overall good series.However, the DVD transfer stunk. The first 8 or 9 episodes actually had excellent visual quality and great English subtitling. After that the subtitles were awful. In some cases it was impossible to figure out what the characters were talking about. In addition, the final episode seems like it was edited to 45 minutes instead of the full hour, leaving bad transitions between scenes and poor visual quality.This really annoyed me. Crappy American television series get the ""full works"", but this nice little Korean series is apparently not good enough for American distributors to put in any effort whatsoever. Didn't anyone bother to view the final product before it was packaged and shipped out? A total disgrace.",3,"Good Series, But the DVD Transfer Stunk",1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,1639,"['girl', 'Eun-hye', 'Yun', 'guy', 'order', 'get', 'job', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', '17-hour', 'miniseries', 'manager', 'love', 'feelings', 'man', 'mood', 'almost', 'always', 'lighthearted', 'characters', 'have', 'childish', 'nature', 'much', 'comedy', 'simplistic', 'slapstick', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'sloppy', 'rather', 'disgusting', 'eating', 'living', 'habits', 'Eun-hye', 'Yun', 'series', 'men', 'were', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'male', 'lead', 'was', 'only', 'so-so', 'healthy', 'amount', 'cheesiness', 'form', 'relationship', 'development', 'considering', 'how', ""'d"", 'have', 'fun', 'doing', 'same', 'activities', 'probably', 'little', 'complain', 'script', 'unambitious', 'even', 'bit', 'weak', 'final', 'episode', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'Still', 'unique', 'experience', 'great', 'pacing', 'unorthodox', 'elements', 'due', 'uni-sex', 'set-up', 'overall', 'good', 'series.However', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'stunk', 'first', '8', '9', 'episodes', 'actually', 'had', 'excellent', 'visual', 'quality', 'great', 'English', 'subtitling', 'subtitles', 'were', 'awful', 'cases', 'was', 'impossible', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'talking', 'about', 'addition', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'edited', '45', 'minutes', 'instead', 'full', 'hour', 'leaving', 'bad', 'transitions', 'scenes', 'poor', 'visual', 'quality.This', 'really', 'annoyed', 'Crappy', 'American', 'television', 'series', 'get', 'full', 'works', 'nice', 'little', 'Korean', 'series', 'apparently', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'American', 'distributors', 'put', 'effort', 'whatsoever', 'Did', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'bother', 'view', 'final', 'product', 'was', 'packaged', 'shipped', 'out', 'total', 'disgrace']",Korean Tv Series: Coffee Prince w/ English Subtitles

1113346,ABQS74EP1NBM4,B000X5HE7Y,Sinton,"[0, 0]","I thought Coffee Prince was the best of all of the Korean TV dramas that I've seen!  It stands outside the typical plot.  It is directed very well, the music does not repeat itself and is not intrusive as in other shows.  Especially pleasing are the actors - all of whom are excellent  especially the stars, Gong Yoo and Yoon Eun-Hye.  Gong Yoo made every scene believable because he seemed to express the character itself.  I did not find the last disc difficult.  Even the difficult grandmother was good and different than the typical grandmother character.  This might be because of the writing, but also because the actress who played her always does such a good job.  She has a sense of humor within her characters which makes her characters multi dimensional.  Enjoy this set!!!",5,Coffee Prince is the Best Yet,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,784,"['thought', 'Coffee', 'Prince', 'was', 'best', 'Korean', 'TV', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'typical', 'plot', 'directed', 'very', 'well', 'music', 'not', 'repeat', 'not', 'intrusive', 'other', 'shows', 'Especially', 'pleasing', 'are', 'actors', 'whom', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'stars', 'Gong', 'Yoo', 'Yoon', 'Eun-Hye', 'Gong', 'Yoo', 'made', 'scene', 'believable', 'seemed', 'express', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'last', 'disc', 'difficult', 'Even', 'difficult', 'grandmother', 'was', 'good', 'different', 'typical', 'grandmother', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'writing', 'also', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'always', 'such', 'good', 'job', 'sense', 'humor', 'characters', 'characters', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'Enjoy', 'set']",Korean Tv Series: Coffee Prince w/ English Subtitles

This was not at all as advertised: came on 1 dvd9 format disk, no box, just a plastic sleeve. Chinese subtitles were clearly visible in the background and the ""Subtitles by MBC"" that appears online was conspicuously absent. After the 10th episode, the English subtitles turned to jibberish: sentence fragments, misspelled words, no capitalization or punctuation. To make things worse, the character names all reverted to Chinese spellings. I couldn't tell who was who. Someone obviously recorded this off of Hong Kong tv and did their own subtitles. Too bad they didn't speak English. Spend the money and get the ""MBC licensed"" or ""Official US"" version.
