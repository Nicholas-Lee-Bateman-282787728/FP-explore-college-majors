I was born the year after all hostilities ceased but saw this film early on and when life was still pretty much as depicted here.  Small city and town America meant most everyone knowing everyone else and most everyone caring for everyone else.  A time when your neighbor became a trusted friend and doing something for someone else was not a thing that made your wallet fatter. It was a time of unlocked houses & cars but most of all...unlocked hearts.  As told and seen through the eyes of the now deceased Matthew Macauley, played by Ray Collins, the patriarch of this family, the story is one of unity, love, friendship, hope undaunted and American ideals. Homer Macauley, portrayed by Mickey Rooney, takes a job at the local telegraph office delivering telegrams after school while his brother Marcus, portrayed by Van Johnson, is away at war and serving their country. Homer means to help his family during this time so his mother, portrayed by Fay Bainter, doesn't have such a difficult time keeping life and limb intact. Throughout his days at school and work he meets and learns wonderful lessons from some interesting & valuable people about living and becoming a man!  Michael Craig, Frank Morgan, Donna Reed and Marsh Hunt round out the cast and that little freckle faced kid, Jackie &#34;Butch&#34; Jenkins, gives a very memorable performance as Ulysses Macauley. This William Saroyan story and quadruple Oscar nominee is a slice of life and Americana not to be missed or dismissed as being too old (1943) to learn anything from...for it is truly timeless.",5,The Human Comedy = A Divine Microcosm of WW II America,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,1728,"['was', 'line', 'older', 'film', 'how', 'feel', 'movie', 'line', '34', 'would', 'have', 'time', 'again', '34', 'sans', 'WW', 'II', 'course', 'was', 'born', 'year', 'hostilities', 'ceased', 'saw', 'film', 'early', 'when', 'life', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'much', 'depicted', 'here', 'Small', 'city', 'town', 'America', 'meant', 'most', 'everyone', 'knowing', 'everyone', 'else', 'most', 'everyone', 'caring', 'everyone', 'else', 'time', 'when', 'neighbor', 'became', 'trusted', 'friend', 'doing', 'something', 'someone', 'else', 'was', 'not', 'thing', 'made', 'wallet', 'fatter', 'was', 'time', 'unlocked', 'houses', 'cars', 'most', 'unlocked', 'hearts', 'told', 'seen', 'eyes', 'now', 'deceased', 'Matthew', 'Macauley', 'played', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'patriarch', 'family', 'story', 'one', 'unity', 'love', 'friendship', 'hope', 'undaunted', 'American', 'ideals', 'Homer', 'Macauley', 'portrayed', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'job', 'local', 'telegraph', 'office', 'delivering', 'telegrams', 'school', 'brother', 'Marcus', 'portrayed', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'away', 'war', 'serving', 'country', 'Homer', 'help', 'family', 'time', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'Fay', 'Bainter', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'difficult', 'time', 'keeping', 'life', 'limb', 'intact', 'days', 'school', 'work', 'wonderful', 'lessons', 'interesting', 'valuable', 'people', 'living', 'becoming', 'man', 'Michael', 'Craig', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Marsh', 'Hunt', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'little', 'freckle', 'faced', 'kid', 'Jackie', '34', 'Butch', '34', 'Jenkins', 'very', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Ulysses', 'Macauley', 'William', 'Saroyan', 'story', 'quadruple', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'slice', 'life', 'Americana', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'dismissed', 'being', 'too', 'old', '1943', 'learn', 'anything', 'truly', 'timeless']",The Human Comedy VHS
280086,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,6301969065,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[1, 2]","Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties.While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring.Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson.There is even an appearance by Ray Collins as Homer's deceased father.While this film is not exactly what I'd call electrifying, it celebrates life and the human ability to persevere regardless of the circumstances.

280087,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6301969065,Craig Connell,"[17, 17]","This is a unique drama, one of those unusual dramas where there are no villains, no evil people. Yet, it's not a sweet-and-sugary movie, either. It's simply a ""slice of life,"" as they say, or ""Americana."" In the case, about life in a small California town during the middle of World War II. It is very true to the book written by William Saroyan.The story features genuinely nice people who trust one another, respect one another, have manners, read the Bible and say their prayers, do what they are told and apologize if they are nasty....not exactly what you've seen in films in the past half century.Although the film is a bunch of vignettes featuring a number of characters, Mickey Rooney is the central figure and I wonder if he ever was better. He is outstanding in here. I never realized what a good actor he was until I saw this movie.Frank Morgan also was memorable in here, and I usually didn't care for the roles he played many times. But here, he's very serious and honest and real.The ""slices of life"" include Rooney and his family, school friends, his job as a telegram delivery boy; Morgan and his drinking problem; James Craig and his romance; Van Johnson and his army buddies and Jackie ""Butch"" Jenkins and his little friends. Also of note are three young military men making an appearance, actors who became well known by the end of the decade: Robert Mitchum, Barry Nelson and Don DeFore. Donna Reed, Fay Bainter and Marsha Hunt add the female touch and a big dose of wholesome beauty. This has a deep cast, as you can see. There are other recognizable actors in here, too, such as ""Alfalfa"" (Carl Switzer) of ""Our Gang"" fame.This picture of ""Americana"" is so innocent compared to today, it is almost shocking. A kiss was a big deal; nobody locked their doors at night; the girls went out on blind dates with the soldiers and all treated each other with respect.It's a very sentimental film, which is another reason I like it. It's a sad comment about film critics who think that ""sentimental"" is a dirty word, but even those cynics still had praise for this film. It's so well done that it's hard not to praise it.

This film should make a home in your movie-hearts forever with the truly memorable characters, situations and performances by it's expert cast, headed by the very young Mickey Rooney. Mickey Rooney you say? This Rooney performance got him a Best Actor Oscar Nomination in 1943 alongside Humphrey Bogart and Gary Cooper amongst others - not bad company to be in. The black & white cinematography by Harry Stradling is superb, as is the transfer of the entire movie.

280090,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6301969065,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[43, 45]","A fine film.  It's pure, distilled, Grade-A, all-star, all-American, accept-no-substitutions, concentrated, three-hankie, melodramatic, sentimental, heartwarming, white picket fence, patriotic wartime schmaltz.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.  Mickey Rooney stars as Homer Macauley, a bright-eyed, fresh-faced, optimistic teenager living in Smalltown, USA during the height of World War Two, when all able bodied young men, including his older brother, have gone off to fight against the fascists and save civilization itself.  Still, even with soldiers passing through town and cannons crowding the trains that are headed back East towards Europe, the war is still far, far away, and civilization can still be saved right here, back on the homefront.  Taking his brother's place as ""the man of the family,"" Homer learns about hard work, fair play, compassion for others, and about disappointment and heartbreak as well.  It's all unremittingly corny, but that's entirely the point.  This is not a modern movie -- it isn't cynical or packed with obligatory violence, nor is it politically nuanced or notably subtle.  But it is a fine document of its time, sort of an ultimate exposition of the best and most cheerful face that mainstream, white America could put on the underlying grimness that a total war mobilization meant for America and the world.  It's a piece of homefront propaganda, but no less true to life, in its way, than any other film of the time.The screenplay by William Saroyan is set in the author's home in California's fertile San Joaquin Valley, and while he makes sweeping nods towards the Valley's legendary cultural diversity (omitting, for the most part, blacks, Jews and Germans...), Saroyan gives Norman Rockwell a run for his money in the sentimental Americana category.  A couple of the religiously-themed scenes may be suffocating to secular or nonsectarian audiences, but other than the film's persistent preachiness, it's a fascinating slice of wartime historical hokum -- worth checking out its time capsule qualities, as well as for entertainment value.  Plus, it's packed with loads of great character actors and all-star cameos, including Frank Morgan (aka The Wizard Of Oz), as Homer's older mentor, Don Defore and (a very young) Robert Mitchum as babyfaced soldiers on leave, and Carl Switzler (""Alfalfa,"" of the Little Rascals) as a teenage hooligan.

I have seen the telegram that came to my aunt from the War Department with the news of his death.  In this 1943 film, Mickey Rooney plays a telegram delivery boy who must often deliver the news of a lost or wounded son to families in his small California town.  For me, the film is excruciatingly poignant.Viewed more than 60 years later, there are flaws in this film -- overlong patriotic monologues, unlikely hymn singing, and a simply impossible ending.  These flaws, however, are more than redeemed by the wonderful interaction between the young telegram delivery boy ""Homer"" (Mickey Rooney) with elderly telegrapher ""Mr. Grogan"" (Frank Morgan), and by the tragic surprise in Mr. Grogan's last telegram.Looking back on old films, we are now alert for how they portrayed race.  There are contrary notes in ""The Human Comedy.""  A picnic scene intended to show America's immigrant diversity includes only white ethnics; it jars.  Yet Asian-Americans in uniform are clearly shown on a troop train, and the omission of African Americans is balanced with an opening scene of a passing train.  The white engineer ignores a boy's eager waves, while an African-American hitching a ride on the caboose is cheerful and open.  Embarrassed by the lack of inclusion, did director Clarence Brown add the scene as a chapeau?Long and wordy scenes in the film, with some special effects, come across today as too sentimental, yet they deserve our attention.  The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther called them ""maudlin gobs of cinematic goo.""  During the war, however, there were 400,000 telegrams delivered to American families announcing the death of a service member -- a now unthinkable scale of tragedy that touched the whole of America.  In this film, author William Saroyan, screenplay writer Howard Estabrook, and director Clarence Brown gave Americans ways to think about and speak of death and sacrifice.  All agree this was America's ""good war.""

This film is tedious, totally &quot;preachy,&quot; and one in which few characters seem at all like anyone who actually walks the earth.The Saroyan novel, for all its excessive patriotic references, basically dealt with a young man's growing to maturity. Mickey Rooney's efforts to make Homer Macauley a likeable teenager are noble, but the film version reduces him to one dimension. Young Ulysses, who has a certain charm in the book, seems a cartoon character. Mother Macaulay is the worst of all - delivering weighty pseudo-wisdom in awesome tones that would put one in mind of the wax figures who sat in &quot;Grandma Predicts&quot; booths at Coney Island.The ending (which I'll not reveal, though it is obvious from the first scene) is sad but realistic in the book - grotesque in the film.

I just saw the filmtoday, and except for some good acting by Mickey Rooney and Frank Morgan, and the charming scene in the library,I didn't care for the film at all.(I'm going to read the book again, soon.) Wikipedia points out that the book differs from the film.Here's what Wikpedia says:Saroyan wrote a movie treatment and a screenplay that he was asked to direct. He was paid off and removed from the project when his film proved to be more than two hours long. Saroyan was not at all happy with the film as completed by Brown, and he wrote his novel from the script he produced. The novel was published at the same time as the film's release with the intent of countering the film version of the story. There are noticeable differences between the film and the novel, including a stronger characterization of Ulysses, the small boy, in the novel and far fewer scenes of sentiment than were incorporated into the film by Estabrook and Brown (social criticism is also much blunter in the novel).[2] Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, who suggested that this was his favorite film, also suggest a very definite ""MGM house style"".I do remember one small difference between the book and the film: in the film, the librarian says to thechildren that she has been reading books for many years, and she emphasizes that it has enriched her life. In thebook, the librarian says that she has been reading books for many years, and she can't say that it has mademuch of a difference in her life. (I remember laughing at that - Saroyan's biting humor, I guess.) The book also has the charming scene in the library, with the two small boys. Saroyan has always been one of my favorite writers, I'd say. (except for his book ""The Adventures of Wesley Jackson,"" which was terrible, I thought.)(P.S.: I became a librarian, myself!)",2,The book differs from the movie in some ways.

You can hurl all the insults you want, but they won't begin to affect the magical, dreamlike (but somewhat off-beat) effect of this unique film, created by Saroyan as a screenplay first, then adapted as a book afterwards---Louis B. Mayer's favorite among the films produced under his rule.Certainly, a jaded, elitist snob will reject the overt sentiment of ""The Human Comedy"" but, then again, the deep and mysterious dimension, the warm, tender mysticism that springs from this gentle, homespun tale of a community united during the darkest days of WWII will obviously have eluded them.A PAGEANT OF SMALL-TOWN AMERICANA, a series of insightful little vignettes about human nature as seen through the eyes of a 15-year old boy who must assume the role of head-of-the-family during the War. I mean, c'mon...the film opens with the voice and spirit of a dead man hovering in the clouds over the verdant fields of his former home town; this is NO ORDINARY TALE of war-time tragedy, but Saroyan's own uniquely emotional view, he being an Armenian immigrant who saw nothing but the greatness and goodness of his adopted homeland, the good old U.S.A.; got a problem with that? --then go spend your time (and vitriol) elsewhere!MICKEY ROONEY---great actor? Watch this film and decide for yourself. Check the scene where the Mick reads aloud a letter from his brother Marcus--you will witness an utterly masterful example of emotional power and restraint. His reading could serve as a textbook for anyone who presumes to understand the actor's craft.FRANK MORGAN--""the great Oz himself!""---great actor? - again, watch and decide.Young Mickey Rooney, who quickly learns life's lessons as a war-time telegram delivery boy, discovers a surrogate father in his boss, played by a strapping young James Craig...a kindly, highly principled young guy who is in love with an absolutely ravishing young Marsha Hunt. But we really don't understand their relationship until an intriguing, lovely scene in a moonlit garden outside of her family's ritzy home, accompanied by Herbert Stothart's breezy, tender background score.I'll admit that Marcus (Van Johnson) picks up that dang' accordion and leads his army buddies in song at least ONE-TOO-MANY times during the film, but it is his friendship with his pal Toby, a fellow soldier who was orphaned (and thus exists without an identity in Saroyan's cosmic view), that provides the film with its most curious and uplifting conclusion (which one reviewer here even describes as ""macabre!""). Saroyan sought to offer his mystical, magical concept of the ETERNAL FLOW and RENEWAL OF LIFE as solace for a grief-stricken America, which was desperately in search of comfort in 1943.  Yeah, it may seem a little clumsy and naive at times, but so what? There are simply too many fascinating and excellent things to comment on in this magnificent film, itself a two-hour TAPESTRY of small-town American life, produced during the heyday of the legendary MGM studio.AND SPEAKING OF 9/11: There is a scene fairly late in the film, where James Craig and his lovely bride (Ms Hunt) are out for a drive in his convertible. They slowly cruise through a sunny park, where an International ethnic festival is in full swing, with dancers of many nations performing. Mr. Craig comments on each dance, while Herbert Stothart's music brilliantly combines the various ethnic rhythms and tunes with a gorgeous, underlying ""My Country 'tis of Thee"", thus underscoring the fact that these ""diverse"" immigrant groups, despite their cultural differences which they celebrate, are all essentially---profoundly---AMERICAN.  The young couple parks the car overlooking a beautiful California vista---vineyards, fields, mountains, while behind the car we see a shimmery, sun-lit pond and a delicate bridge, across which children seem to dance; it is a vision of pastoral, radiant beauty, which mirrors the emotional ecstasy of the newlywed couple. And, after having shared their dreams of their future first child, Mr. Craig tells his bride that he has decided to enlist in the Navy (and this shortly before he must help young Mickey deal with the devastating emotional blow that we...and his  chracter....felt was coming all along).And such is the fascinating, one-of-a-kind magic and deceptively simple puzzle of ""The Human Comedy""; you simply CANNOT judge it as if it were a standard war-era film.Oh, yes...when my wife and I first watched the folk-dance scene described above, she commented that it was ""awfully hoaky.""  The next time we watched it together was three days after 9-11, and the SAME SCENE left us both weeping like little kids.AT LAST, Turner/MGM/Warner Home Video---WHOEVER is responsible---THANKS for finally releasing this great film on DVD.  And Mickey Rooney and Marsh Hunt are STILL WITH US, and will hopefully be able to enjoy what very well may be their greatest film achievement!!Larry Rapchak",5,"Mystical, lyrical fable of WWII

I thought it was a nice attempt to summerize the moods, trials, and perspectives of the folks at home during WWII.  In attempting such a bold purpose, it takes a few liberties.  Unfortunately, those liberties have tended to stay with me longer than the rest of the movie.  One of the artistic licenses was a drive through the park on a Sunday afternoon.  As our characters drive along, they pass one ethnic group after another; each doing their own cultural ""thing"" often in their unique cultural dress.  The message is meant to be about America welcoming all groups into embrace but it's hard not to notice, from 60 years down the road, how nobody seems to be assimulating and none are interacting with each other.The other artistic liberty was the portrayal of the idea that one life replaces another.  It's a nice perspective of life, death, and the continuation of society (""When I die there'll be one child born to carry on"").  However, as portrayed in ""The Human Comedy"", there is no allowance for the very real considerations of grief and its' lengthy process.All that aside, there is a lot of Homefront Americana that makes this movie worthwhile.

On surface it's comparable to ""Sunday Dinner For A Soldier"" and ""The Fighting Sullivans,"" but overall a better picture.  It has a sad part, but is also uplifting, with many humorous and poignant scenes.Mickey Rooney (Young Tom Edison, Boys Town, National Velvet, etc.) plays teenage Homer, who takes a job in the local telegraph office delivering messages - many of tragic news, since it's the height of World War II - to friends, acquaintances, and strangers throughout his home town, Ithaca.  His older brother Van Johnson (30 Seconds Over Tokyo, In The Good Old Summertime, etc.) has gone off to fight the war.  His  younger brother Ulysses - Useless to his friends (Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins, who also appeared in National Velvet and Our Vines Have Tender Grapes)  - is just five years old and discovering life with daily wonder.Homer looks up to the manager of the telegraph office, James Craig (Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, Lost Angel), and the elderly telegrapher, Frank Morgan (The Wizard of Oz, The Shop Around The Corner), who requires, ""in the event of drunkenness - mine, not yours,"" a degree of understanding only a child can provide.  Homer clashes with a schoolmate, learns from his teacher, misses his brother, all in scenes with Leave-It-To-Beaver flavor.Meanwhile Ulysses visits the town Library with his older friend Lionel (Darryl Hickman, who appeared in numerous movies including Keeper of the Flame and The Tingler, and whose brother Dwayne played Dobie Gillis).  Neither can read, but they sure are awed just to look at all the books, all of them different.  Later they join older boys stealing apricots, then Ulysses learns the meaning of fear from a mechanical man in a store window.Homer's sister, Donna Reed (It's A Wonderful Life,  Ransom) entertains three soldiers on leave, played by Don DeFore (Ramrod, Ozzie and Harriet), Barry Nelson (A Guy Named Joe, Airport), and a very young Robert Mitchum.Ray Collins, who went on to play Police Lieutenant Tragg on Perry Mason, plays the spirit of of Homer's late father, who narrates at the beginning and end of the film.All of these actors play their roles well to make the movie effective, including the children.  Others in the cast include Marsha Hunt (Valley Of Decision, Lost Angel) as James Craig's girl, Fay Bainter (Our Town, State Fair) as Homer's mother, Clem Bevins (Wake Up And Dream) as the apricot owner, and in bit parts Morris Ankrum (who often played a judge on Perry Mason), Frank Craven (Our Town, Jack London, Penrod And Sam, etc.), S.Z.

Sure, but those who take the time to feel the deeper message will be rewarded. Apparently, some of my reviewing predecessors kept their minds closed to the depth (yes, that's right) of the story. First of all, this is a fable; a commentary not on life itself, but about life as it ought to be. The fact that it involves Ithaca, and characters named Homer, Ulysses & Marcus suggests Greek tragedy (the irony of the title) and the Greek chorus (the father). I couldn't possibly deny the fact that there are plenty of sappy moments, but they are layered & blended with some quite profound lessons. Let's not forget that in 1942 the war was at its absolute peak and enouragement like this was not only welcome but very necessary. Mickey Rooney gave a relaxed, centered performance, probably his best; Frank Morgan, Fay Bainter, James Craig, Marsha Hunt...all wonderful. How can you not feel for Homer when he has to deliver a singing telegram to his girlfriend...sent by his rival? Clarence Brown, known for heart-tuggers (The Yearling, National Velvet) came thru with flying colors, juggling the very complicated events & episodes into a coherent narrative. Say or think what you want...I was moved and touched by the over-all power of this film. It is quite verbose, and some of the preachy little speeches might've been shortened, but the substance of those little speeches hit home powerfully. Home, family, work, love...all those things that matter...are portrayed here as they ""ought"" to be, and after the tragedy of Sept 11, I welcome this little reminder of the things we have that are taken so much for granted.

Also, we peek into the lives of his younger brother Ulysses (Jackie Jenkins) and sister Bess (Donna Reed).This film is terribly sentimental and very biased toward family and Christianity. However, sometimes it is too sentimental and instead of seeming genuine, it comes off as a bit forced. The lessons are true, but they're presented in a way one would speak to a four year old.
