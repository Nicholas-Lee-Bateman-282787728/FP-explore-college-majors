If it was made today and by an American company, it would cost over a billion dollars. Back to the film, the complete version [unabridged] follows the book very closely. This is what I like about Russian films, they think the author of the book has provided enough drama, enough for a film than having a film based on the original but not being original.",5,Consider to be one of the best films ever made.,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,497,"['owned', 'film', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'used', 'copy', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'abridged', 'Hoping', '5', 'DVDs', 'will', 'have', 'complete', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'today', 'American', 'company', 'would', 'cost', 'billion', 'dollars', 'Back', 'film', 'complete', 'version', '[', 'unabridged', ']', 'book', 'very', 'closely', 'what', 'like', 'Russian', 'films', 'think', 'author', 'book', 'provided', 'enough', 'drama', 'enough', 'film', 'having', 'film', 'based', 'original', 'not', 'being', 'original']",N/A

The film was faithful to the book.  I did expect the film to be closer to 8 hours (this was close to 7 hours) thinking that such a version exists.  The acting was fine, with the actors fitting the images in my head.  The battle scenes are remarkable.  I was disappointed with the ending, since it did not include the book's epilogue.  I was also surprised that the quality of the film print was not as sharp as I expected it to be, since I assumed this was a newer DVD of the 1968 film.  Still, a very fine movie in many ways.

195910,A1N5YEQ29VU3C2,5489003219,Trout26,"[18, 18]","The Russico 5-disk version is the definitive video edition of this masterpiece. For one, it is the only release in widescreen (the Kultur release is fullscreen). Everything about this film is epic, be it on the battlefield or in a palace; having nearly half of the original frame ""missing"" is unconscionable. Secondly, this is the original unabridged version of the film, presented in it's original ""parts"" with opening and closing credits for each (the Kultur version is based on the original American theatrical release which is shorter by over an hour).If there is a ""down side"" of this release it lies in the inconsistant subtitles and dubbed track. The subtitles and (poorly acted) dubbing are retained from the American release, so when you get to the previously cut scenes, one or the other disappear; at times there are only subtitles, at times only dubbing, leaving you in the situation where you really need to have both turned on to follow the entire story (and there are places where there are neither). As I have read the book several times and have watched all of the various film versions I know the story very well; I turn both off and just enjoy the fine acting the original Russian. But this is not recommended for someone who is not familiar with the story.The audio/video restoration is almost as good as it can be. The sound is excellent, however the video is not optimal. Unfortunately, the particular film and processing that was commonly used in Europe in the mid 60s was inferior by most standards, and time has caused a significant deterioration in the master negatives and existing prints. COULD this be fixed with a frame-by-frame cleaning and rebalancing - probably. But for a film of this length, the cost would be prohibative given the ""niche"" audience that such a restoration would attract.In a perfect world, a frame-by-frame restoration would be done, new, consistant, subtitles would be prepared, the wooden dubbed track would be completely rewritten and rerecorded with new actors, and it would be released on blu-ray. But the world is not a perfect place, and I believe that this is the best restoration that we will likely ever see.",4,"Outstanding, but perhaps not for beginners",1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2170,"['Russico', '5-disk', 'version', 'definitive', 'video', 'edition', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'only', 'release', 'widescreen', 'Kultur', 'release', 'fullscreen', 'Everything', 'film', 'epic', 'be', 'battlefield', 'palace', 'having', 'nearly', 'half', 'original', 'frame', 'missing', 'unconscionable', 'Secondly', 'original', 'unabridged', 'version', 'film', 'presented', 'original', 'parts', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'Kultur', 'version', 'based', 'original', 'American', 'theatrical', 'release', 'shorter', 'hour', '.If', 'down', 'side', 'release', 'inconsistant', 'subtitles', 'dubbed', 'track', 'subtitles', 'poorly', 'acted', 'dubbing', 'are', 'retained', 'American', 'release', 'so', 'when', 'get', 'previously', 'cut', 'scenes', 'one', 'other', 'disappear', 'times', 'are', 'only', 'subtitles', 'times', 'only', 'dubbing', 'leaving', 'situation', 'where', 'really', 'need', 'have', 'turned', 'follow', 'entire', 'story', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'are', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'several', 'times', 'have', 'watched', 'various', 'film', 'versions', 'know', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'turn', 'just', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'acting', 'original', 'Russian', 'not', 'recommended', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'familiar', 'story.The', 'audio/video', 'restoration', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'sound', 'excellent', 'however', 'video', 'not', 'optimal', 'Unfortunately', 'particular', 'film', 'processing', 'was', 'commonly', 'used', 'Europe', 'mid', '60s', 'was', 'inferior', 'most', 'standards', 'time', 'caused', 'significant', 'deterioration', 'master', 'negatives', 'existing', 'prints', 'COULD', 'be', 'fixed', 'frame-by-frame', 'cleaning', 'rebalancing', 'probably', 'film', 'length', 'cost', 'would', 'be', 'prohibative', 'given', 'niche', 'audience', 'restoration', 'would', 'attract.In', 'perfect', 'world', 'frame-by-frame', 'restoration', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'new', 'consistant', 'subtitles', 'would', 'be', 'prepared', 'wooden', 'dubbed', 'track', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'rewritten', 'rerecorded', 'new', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'blu-ray', 'world', 'not', 'perfect', 'place', 'believe', 'best', 'restoration', 'will', 'likely', 'ever', 'see']",N/A
