However, there is usually some aspect of these films I can readily identify as the reason for my appreciation, such as it featuring an actor(ess) I like, a good filming location (beach, haunted house), etc. While this movie is not the worst horror film I've seen, it also doesn't have anything special enough to overcome its many limitations. For example, the killer scarecrow (no spoiler here, its an obvious plot element from the artwork) wears a mask that comes down partially to his shoulders; every time he turns his head, guess what...the whole thing moves.  This is pitiful; they could have at least covered the bottom portion with clothing. Second, this movie falls prey to the way too often repeated low quality horror film mistake - an extremely brash character introduced to provide conflict, but who ends up being so grating as to distract from the whole film.  I will say there were a few aspects of ok-ness, but overall, you're better spending your time viewing films more likely to be enjoyable.",2,"Garbage, but mildly entertaining",1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,1110,"['have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'big', 'sucker', 'horror', 'generally', 'perceived', 'low', 'quality', 'productions', 'However', 'usually', 'aspect', 'films', 'can', 'readily', 'identify', 'reason', 'appreciation', 'such', 'featuring', 'actor', 'ess', 'like', 'good', 'filming', 'location', 'beach', 'haunted', 'house', 'etc', 'movie', 'not', 'worst', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'special', 'enough', 'overcome', 'many', 'limitations', 'example', 'killer', 'scarecrow', 'spoiler', 'here', 'obvious', 'plot', 'element', 'artwork', 'mask', 'down', 'partially', 'shoulders', 'time', 'head', 'guess', 'what', 'whole', 'thing', 'moves', 'pitiful', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'covered', 'bottom', 'portion', 'clothing', 'Second', 'movie', 'prey', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'repeated', 'low', 'quality', 'horror', 'film', 'mistake', 'extremely', 'brash', 'character', 'introduced', 'provide', 'conflict', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'so', 'grating', 'distract', 'whole', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'were', 'few', 'aspects', 'ok-ness', 'overall', ""'re"", 'better', 'spending', 'time', 'viewing', 'films', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'enjoyable']",N/A

I rarely speak of such hallowed territory, but this movie reaches the ""so bad that it's good"" plateau. With lines like Character A: Be careful? Character B: It's okay I know this place like the back of my hand Character A: No I mean there's a homicidal scarecrow out there! What's not to like? The ridiculous plot? The wooden acting by Ken Shamrock? The ending which completely rips off the Exorcist? The insipid dialogue which was clearly written by a guy who has no idea how women talk? The token black guy who says token black guyisms? The fact that you can see the scarecrow's mask flapping up often?Never have I enjoyed a movie which is so bad so much.

While the previous two films, Scarecrow and Scarecrow Slayer were action packed and sprinkled with humor, this film lacks both.The `story' is nearly non-existent. It seems the director attempts to cover this fact by having every woman in the movie take their tops off, but not even that can distract from the horrible rendition of the Scarecrow. In the previous films, I found the costume and make-up to be original, convincing, and scary. This time, the Scarecrow is obviously just a guy in a burlap sack with a Halloween mask so cheap you can see his skin around the eye holes.And don't even ask how the acting was. The best actor in the film is Ken Shamrock. That says most of it right there.While I enjoy bargain basement horror films, this one should have stayed in the basement.

WRONG!!!! This is a terrible movie!! First of all, the casting and acting is terrible. Ken Shamrock better stick to what he does best because acting is not it! What a terrible actor! He plays a coach of some college kids who decide to head to the beach for a spring break. Before going, they tie a poor diabetic guy to the scarecrow as part of some kind of joke. This brings the scarecrow back to life. The boy is later discovered by a friend who stayed behind. He finds him very sick and brings him to the local hospital. Meanwhile, the kids are at the beach. In this movie, the scarecrow whistles and when you hear this silly whistle, you know that someone is about to be killed. This movie has few killing scenes and is just plain boring and silly.
