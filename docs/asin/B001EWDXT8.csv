1186658,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B001EWDXT8,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[4, 4]","One Tree Hill - The Complete Sixth Season is arguably the best season of this much-loved drama. Season 5 really caught my attention last year, I have to admit I never cared for this show when these characters were in high school, the storylines were over-the-top but now I enjoy the maturity. I have recently gone back and watched the previous seasons and I still don't care for all the hoopla - Season 6 is just brilliant so start here and work your way back. Sophia Bush's character Brooke Davis really got to shine this season, she took in Sam, a wise beyond her years teenage girl - fell in love with Peyton's ex Julian and made amends with her emotionally distant mother. The season finale seemed like a series finale but I heard the show will back next season.

1186661,A1781C6P9VMU9Q,B001EWDXT8,Book girl Eva,"[4, 21]","After the 4th season I had ben ready to give up on One Tree Hill.  The same old storylines, the never ending Lucas/Brooke/Peyton storyline, and the shows habit to put its main characters in life threating positions over and over to the point that you almost wish they would die, just so there would be some actual drama.  The only time this worked was with Keith (they actually killed him) and it turned out to be the best storyline in the shows history.  So when season 5 began I reluctantly watched the 1st episode and was suprised that I liked it.  And before I knew it, I was looking forward to the new episodes every week.  The show had been revitalized, with new characters, new ways of life, and adult problems to go with it.  It was like a brand new show.  When season 6 came out it was like to season 5 never happened.  The tired ideas and storylines from before were trotted back out, (Dan and Payton both having life threating health issues) and almost eveything good about season 5 was thrown out.  I am so tired of this show.  I hope that if the show if renewed (which is doubtful) they go back to what was working and throw the recycled old crap out.",2,What happened?,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,1164,"['4th', 'season', 'had', 'ben', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'same', 'old', 'storylines', 'never', 'ending', 'Lucas/Brooke/Peyton', 'storyline', 'shows', 'habit', 'put', 'main', 'characters', 'life', 'threating', 'positions', 'point', 'almost', 'would', 'die', 'just', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'actual', 'drama', 'only', 'time', 'worked', 'was', 'Keith', 'actually', 'killed', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'storyline', 'shows', 'history', 'So', 'when', 'season', '5', 'began', 'reluctantly', 'watched', '1st', 'episode', 'was', 'suprised', 'liked', 'knew', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'new', 'episodes', 'week', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'revitalized', 'new', 'characters', 'new', 'ways', 'life', 'adult', 'problems', 'go', 'was', 'brand', 'new', 'show', 'When', 'season', '6', 'came', 'was', 'season', '5', 'never', 'happened', 'tired', 'ideas', 'storylines', 'were', 'trotted', 'back', 'Dan', 'Payton', 'having', 'life', 'threating', 'health', 'issues', 'almost', 'eveything', 'good', 'season', '5', 'was', 'thrown', 'out', 'am', 'so', 'tired', 'show', 'hope', 'show', 'renewed', 'doubtful', 'go', 'back', 'what', 'was', 'working', 'throw', 'recycled', 'old', 'crap', 'out']",One Tree Hill: S6 (DVD)

And, while there may be some similarities stylistic wise the attitude and characters sever that tie quickly.  ""One Tree Hill"" had a very average 5th season as the characters were making the transition from school to adulthood.  Season six brought back the edginess that was missing in season 5.  It's sad that the two main characters, Lucas Scott and Peyton Sawyer are now gone.  To me, they along with Brooke Davis, made the show what it was.  Will that magic be gone now?  Only time will tell.  But I can say this, the first 6 seasons are some of the best as far as tv drama is concerned.

1186674,A26CMIDFD6VCLY,B001EWDXT8,thenamegame,"[3, 6]","It finally happened: Peyton and Lucas got married and had a baby girl named Sawyer! To be quite honest, the series ""One Tree Hill"" has lost its touch from WAY too many story lines of having characters fight back and forth over the same things again and again. Brooke (Sophia Bush) continues to fight with her mother Victoria (Daphne Zuniga)in who has control over the ""Clothes Over Bros"" store. She has a continuing relationship with Julian (Austin Nichols) and in the end, tries to make him jealous by having a fling with Nick Lachey from the 90's boy band ""98 Degrees"" and ""adopts"" the rebellious teen Sam Walker (Ashley Rickards). The basketball rebel Quentin Fields (Robbie Jones)life ends suddenly when he is an innocent bystander in a robbery. Nathan (James Lafferty) continues on his neverending quest to become a rising NBA star, (although I don't understand how you can after you shave points in a high school basketball game). Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) gets offered to have his book turned into a movie and finds it hard to cast the actors and actresses to play the people in his life. Peyton (Hilarie Burton)finds out that she might have cancer and the possible risk of it hurting her and her unborn child. Haley (Bethany Joy Galeotti) struggles in her career as a teacher and goes back to her roots as a singer/songwriter. Young Jamie (Jackson Brundage) deals with the sudden death of Quentin, the discovery of Skillz (Antawn Tanner) and his grandmother Deb (Barbara Alyn Woods)hooking up, and understanding the pains of growing up. From this season, I'm still wondering why Dan (Paul Johansson)was kept alive throughout this season even though crazy nanny Carrie (Torrey DeVitto) ran him over and attempted to make him suffer in anyway possible. Overall, this season was hugely disappointing in many levels. These ""Tree Hill"" characters may think they've grown-up but really, they're still trapped in the same high school drama. Hilarie Burton and Chad Michael Murray will not be returning for Season 7 and the producers hope to mix it up with new characters and the setting will be one year into the future.",2,One Tree Hill - Season 6,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,2123,"['finally', 'happened', 'Peyton', 'Lucas', 'got', 'married', 'had', 'baby', 'girl', 'named', 'Sawyer', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'series', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'lost', 'touch', 'WAY', 'too', 'many', 'story', 'lines', 'having', 'characters', 'fight', 'back', 'forth', 'same', 'things', 'again', 'again', 'Brooke', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'fight', 'mother', 'Victoria', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'who', 'control', 'Clothes', 'Over', 'Bros', 'store', 'continuing', 'relationship', 'Julian', 'Austin', 'Nichols', 'end', 'make', 'jealous', 'having', 'fling', 'Nick', 'Lachey', '90', 'boy', 'band', '98', 'Degrees', 'adopts', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'Sam', 'Walker', 'Ashley', 'Rickards', 'basketball', 'rebel', 'Quentin', 'Fields', 'Robbie', 'Jones', 'life', 'suddenly', 'when', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'robbery', 'Nathan', 'James', 'Lafferty', 'neverending', 'quest', 'become', 'rising', 'NBA', 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'can', 'shave', 'points', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'game', 'Lucas', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'offered', 'have', 'book', 'turned', 'movie', 'hard', 'cast', 'actors', 'actresses', 'play', 'people', 'life', 'Peyton', 'Hilarie', 'Burton', 'out', 'might', 'have', 'cancer', 'possible', 'risk', 'hurting', 'unborn', 'child', 'Haley', 'Bethany', 'Joy', 'Galeotti', 'career', 'teacher', 'back', 'roots', 'singer/songwriter', 'Young', 'Jamie', 'Jackson', 'Brundage', 'sudden', 'death', 'Quentin', 'discovery', 'Skillz', 'Antawn', 'Tanner', 'grandmother', 'Deb', 'Barbara', 'Alyn', 'Woods', 'hooking', 'up', 'understanding', 'pains', 'growing', 'up', 'season', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'why', 'Dan', 'Paul', 'Johansson', 'was', 'kept', 'alive', 'season', 'even', 'crazy', 'nanny', 'Carrie', 'Torrey', 'DeVitto', 'ran', 'attempted', 'make', 'suffer', 'anyway', 'possible', 'Overall', 'season', 'was', 'hugely', 'disappointing', 'many', 'levels', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'characters', 'may', 'think', ""'ve"", 'grown-up', 'really', ""'re"", 'still', 'trapped', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'Hilarie', 'Burton', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'Season', '7', 'producers', 'hope', 'mix', 'up', 'new', 'characters', 'setting', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'year', 'future']",One Tree Hill: S6 (DVD)
