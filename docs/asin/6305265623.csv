A pervious reviewer said it was demeaning towards blacks but I think it shows how the politians exploit them with the campaign lies. The  movie is about how Politians fianace thier campains to stay in office. They  only care about who gives them thier money and thats who they please. This  is the sad truth about american politics that all americans should be aware  of. In one statement from the movie as all the truth in it: rich people  stayed on top because they divided black people from white people.

457150,A2YM9ILTAX0782,6305265623,"Birt Acres ""Cinemaniac""","[2, 3]","""Bulworth"" (1998), starring and directed by Warren Beatty, is a funny political satire but not nearly as intelligent as Tim Robbins's ""Bob Roberts"" (1992).  ""Bulworth"" features Beatty as a burnt-out politician who obtains a ten-million dollar life insurance policy and then hires a man to assassinate him that weekend, the insurance to go to his daughter.  He is taken to a routine engagement with a black congregation.  Because of his imminent death, instead of reading a speech of platitudes he speaks the ""truth.""  People are shocked, outraged, and delighted.  Invigorated by truth telling, he begins to party raucously at a black nightclub.  More stops, including a political debate, show Beatty speaking more truth.  The news has a heyday.  His campaign manager has a near-breakdown.  And then Beatty, realizing the good he can do by speaking the truth, tries to call off his hit man.The major problem with ""Bulworth"" as a political satire is that all of the film's ""truth"" is simply radical liberalism.  And I'm not necessarily against that viewpoint (I liked ""Bob Roberts"" immensely), but the movie portrays Bulworth's truth-telling as not his own true opinions but actual Truth--as if there is only one truth and everybody really knows it.  The position of the film is not a hyper-reality, as was ""Bob Roberts,"" but is clearly meant to be grounded in our actual world.  Thus Beatty and ""Bulworth"" posit that anyone who disagrees with Bulworth's truth-telling is deluded, stupid, or, most likely, a liar.  Indeed, in our postmodern age the idea for this comedy seems more than a little contrived.  For a few chuckles, ""Bulworth"" is well worth watching.

457155,A17N23WXA7EAF,6305265623,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[13, 14]","First of all, let me state that while I liked this movie it does have many problems and I agree with the more intelligent negative reviews that it has received. But &quot;Bulworth&quot; appealed to me not so much because it provided the right answers but because it asked the right questions. It did so in a humorous, &quot;no holds barred&quot; fashion that is equally likely to alienate the right wing bigot as the politically correct campus moron.&quot;Bulworth&quot; is about a politician whose failed personal life and hypocritical political one compels him to kill himself. He puts a contract out on his life and while he's waiting to be knocked off he's suddenly free to say whatever he wants.And so he does. During a 72-hour insomnia marathon, Bulworth ditches his canned speeches, and sound bites and instead says what's really on his mind. He tells a black church that he doesn't really care about their vote because they are black. He tells a Jewish group that you can't run for office without appeasing the Jews. He drinks whiskey during a political debate and explains to the camera that he doesn't care. Sound like Jack Nicholoson is running for office? Not exactly. Bullworth also falls in love with a black woman and becomes exposed to a different world of rap clubs, armed kids selling drugs, and police brutality.I can understand where a lot of reviewers got turned off here. Yes, the black gang leader and white racist cops are stereotypes. And yes, Bulworth's journey into this world is just too smooth and easy. But to the film's credit, real issues of racism, crime, and poverty are handled in a blunt unsentimental fashion that somehow avoids the in-your-face brutality that often comes with realism. When Bulworth intervenes to prevent youthful drug sellers from being bullied by the police his actions and motive come from practical benevolence instead of a self-righteous crusade.One of the funniest and most powerful moments of the film occurs when Bulworth asks the armed prepubescent drug sellers &quot;shouldn't you be eating ice cream instead of being out here?&quot; In the next scene, Bulworth buys the kids-guns and all-ice cream cones. The film is telling us in the simplest and least didactic manner that these are just kids. They should be leading a normal child's life, not a life of crime.Bulworth's relationship with various characters and the events that transpire are unbelievable to a large degree, but this isn't a documentary. It's a film that exposes a problem and raises questions about how to solve it. The problem is political hypocrisy. All of the politicians who are driven by corporate money and surveys have no interest in solving real problems. At the same time, the excuse of the crime boss, that at least he's providing children with some degree of wealth by employing them to sell drugs is exposed for the self-serving lie that it is.At the end of the film, Bulworth doesn't save the world and things don't magically work out. Once he comes down from his insomnia and manic speech acts he has to face the world as an uniformed politician again. But his transformation is real. As he leaves the black woman's house looking almost ashamed to be there he turns and asks &quot;are you coming?&quot; Then he explains that he loves her but he's insecure about being White. He isn't' a superman whose been transformed by his experiences, but he has grown and one senses that whatever he does it will be a meaningful compromise between the sellout politics of his past and the shock value activities of his recent experiences. The black crime boss must also compromise if he is to truly change things in his neighborhood for the better. In order to make meaningful changes in his community, he must maintain his ruthless reputation to some degree, but now he dose so as a self-conscious facade.I agree that Warren Beaty's rapping was sub par, but who cares? &quot;Bulworth&quot; makes a powerful statement that in order to transcend problems of crime, poverty, racism, and political corruption we are going to have to take a cold hard look at who we really are and what is really happening around us. Accepting other people--particularly from different racial and economic backgrounds--has to be more than just an insincere speech act.

A pork barrel project if ever there was one. The premise is that a Senator hires a hit man to kill himself so his family can collect on the insurance. He has made some bad investments on pork belly futures, and you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Knowing that he is going to die soon, he feels free enough to do something no politician has ever done before: he starts telling the truth. Next thing you know he's fallen for Nina (Halle Berry) and has become the most ridiculous white rapper since Vanilla Ice.Sounds like a recipe for disaster? But wait, it is a great movie! Spike Lee WISHES he could've made Bulworth. It is so good that by the time it gets to Warren's Adrian Brody moment, you are actually rooting him on. Nina, played by Halle Berry, is his muse, his inspiration, the object of his desire, and his assassin, all rolled into one. She is smokin' hot, yet never has to even take off her top. She's like a kosher ham sandwich. I don't know how she does it!---------------------------------------Nina: ...Yo.Bullworth: Yo.

William Baldwin is Constance Bulworth's Lover (uncredited). Oliver Platt is Dennis Murphy, Bulworth's campaign manager. He has his hands and nose full trying to keep the Senator in line and himself in lines. Larry King is Himself. Though it is quite a stretch, he actually does OK. Same for George Hamilton and John McLaughlin. Don Cheadle is notable as L.D., a drug dealer. Isaiah Washington is Darnell, Nina's Brother. You might not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago, for playing that doctor on Grey's Anatomy who went with Sandra Oh. Jack Warden, who passed away on July 19th, 2006, played Eddie Davers, a spear carrier for the Senator. I remember him from Shampoo, another Warren Beatty vehicle that was also political, in its own little conditioner, rinse, and repeat way, from the pre-bicenntennial year of 1975. Mimi, a television technician who monitors the footage of the Senator's meltdown, is played by Laurie Metcalf. If you wonder where it is you've seen her, perhaps it was on Roseanne, where she was the sister.---------------------------------------[after watching Bulworth lose it on TV]Mimi: Now - would we be eligible for an Emmy, or a Peabody?---------------------------------------I don't know Mimi. Ask Bill O'Reilly.Sen. Jay Billington Bulworth gets away with saying the most outrageous things. He is also like a kosher ham sandwich. I don't know how he does it! I was extremely dubious when I heard the concept and saw a clip of Beatty as Bulworth in his rapper duds. How can this movie NOT suck? Plan 9 From Outer Space move over! Ishtar II, The sequel.

Beware, it deals mainly with the politics of the mid-1990s, a time when the Democratic Party was trying to develop a more conservative image to recover votes from the Newt Gingrich army.  And who better to play senator Jay Bulworth than Warren Beatty, the same guy who directed REDS and played its American Communist hero?Basically the idea is this:  Democrats are (or WERE as of 1996) taking more and more money from corporations and financial interests in exchange for policies that favored big money over the poor and working class.  Senator Bulworth is shown crying in the opening scene, probably in shame and guilt at what he and the Democrats have become.  He is so upset that he plots a final effort to extract life insurance money for his family.  But then something happens!Upon visiting a ghetto in the LA area, Bulworth suddenly develops a brutal honesty instead of the ""typical politician"" double talk.  It is then that he undergoes a transformation, shedding his conservative image for a crass and unabashedly leftist series of rants (and he takes up freestyle rap to deliver the message).  Basically he says:  Politics is dominated by big money, the Democrats have betrayed the little guy, and it's time for a new grassroots movement.  He makes sure to show some support for campaign finance reform and single payer health care (hence the dirty word, ""socialism.""  I wonder if Beatty had fond memories of Jack Reed and REDS when they shot that scene?).Interestingly this film came out in 1998, and many of the core ideas it explores became the focus of Ralph Nader's 2000 campaign for President.  Today it is John Edwards and Dennis Kucinich who have taken up the role of working class heroes.  The next few years will tell whether the Democrats truly can be a party of the people -- or if it is finally time for the masses to break ranks and independently form a real people's movement.",5,"Come on, let me hear that dirty word - SOCIALISM!",1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,1958,"['like', 'political', 'comedy', 'THE', 'show', 'Beware', 'mainly', 'politics', 'mid-1990s', 'time', 'when', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'was', 'trying', 'develop', 'more', 'conservative', 'image', 'recover', 'votes', 'Newt', 'Gingrich', 'army', 'who', 'better', 'play', 'senator', 'Jay', 'Bulworth', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'REDS', 'played', 'American', 'Communist', 'hero', 'Basically', 'idea', 'Democrats', 'are', 'WERE', '1996', 'taking', 'more', 'more', 'money', 'corporations', 'financial', 'interests', 'exchange', 'policies', 'favored', 'big', 'money', 'poor', 'working', 'class', 'Senator', 'Bulworth', 'shown', 'crying', 'opening', 'scene', 'probably', 'shame', 'guilt', 'what', 'Democrats', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'upset', 'final', 'effort', 'extract', 'life', 'insurance', 'money', 'family', 'then', 'something', 'visiting', 'ghetto', 'LA', 'area', 'Bulworth', 'suddenly', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'instead', 'typical', 'politician', 'double', 'talk', 'then', 'transformation', 'shedding', 'conservative', 'image', 'crass', 'unabashedly', 'leftist', 'series', 'rants', 'up', 'freestyle', 'rap', 'deliver', 'message', 'Basically', 'Politics', 'dominated', 'big', 'money', 'Democrats', 'have', 'betrayed', 'little', 'guy', 'time', 'new', 'grassroots', 'movement', 'sure', 'show', 'support', 'campaign', 'finance', 'reform', 'single', 'payer', 'health', 'care', 'hence', 'dirty', 'word', 'socialism', 'wonder', 'Beatty', 'had', 'fond', 'memories', 'Jack', 'Reed', 'REDS', 'when', 'shot', 'scene', '.Interestingly', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1998', 'many', 'core', 'ideas', 'became', 'focus', 'Ralph', 'Nader', '2000', 'campaign', 'President', 'Today', 'John', 'Edwards', 'Dennis', 'Kucinich', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'role', 'working', 'class', 'heroes', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'tell', 'Democrats', 'truly', 'can', 'be', 'party', 'people', 'finally', 'time', 'masses', 'break', 'ranks', 'independently', 'form', 'real', 'people', 'movement']",N/A

Warren Beatty, in his fourth film as a director - and his first one as a screenwriter - is great as this democrate, over-exhausted and desperate senator who turns crazy during his campaign and lets down the bla-bla-bla for some real talking.The beginning, in Washington, is depressive and real funny in the same time: Bulworth cries but he does it watching his own hypocrisy on the screen ('We stand on the doorstep of a new millenium...'). His marriage is a complete failure. Tired and desperate by his own life, disgusted by the empty, senseless and lying speeches prepared for him, he decides to get over all of this and puts a contract on... himself. Then he starts his campaign and arrives in L.A., first in South Central, the Black ghetto, and falls in love with a real beauty (Halle Berry, lately 'Academy-awarded'). He comes back to life and tries to cancel the 'research' he'd started but his contact has a heart attack...This very funny and inventive story was original enough for having being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1998, along with ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Life is beautiful"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"". The film gives us many great and raving moments, especially that meeting that degenerates into a rap and hip-hop concert, and that broadcasted, hilarating, angry interview ('Obscenity?'). The soundtrack, 'rappy' and agressive (Dr. Dre, Ice Cube...), is quite unusual in a Hollywood great production, even if it mixes with Ennio Morricone's lyrical, superb partitions (what a great idea!) and with the usual political musical stuff.On the whole, Beatty makes us laugh as he shoots everything, especially the hard cynicism of the American political and business circles, showing the social and ecological failure of the system ('As long as we can drive a car, the whole planet can die'). He uses comedy and rap music - of course he (maybe) doesn't rap great, Mr. Kelly, but don't forget he's sixty! At his age, he makes a brilliant performance - to get his message through. And he does it so well, with so much strength that the movie was released with no rush and partly censored by the very studio which financed it. In Paris and suburbs, the movie was screened in only six theaters.But Bulworth doesn't care.

Words aren't worth a penny unless you're worth billions. And of course, from the first instant, this divine fool's failure is certain and imminent: Big Business, what with its grimy fingers perpetually immersed in the U.S. Government's proverbial tub of crunchy Jif, would never allow a politician like Bulworth to succeed, at the risk of the working class' newfound capacity to leech the power from the insurance companies and tire manufacturers.But here's the best part: this poor movie didn't stand a chance of finding a target demographic, just as we know from the first instant Bulworth doesn't stand a chance, either.

When I first viewed the film I was kind of put off by much of the rhetoric.  Subsequent viewings however revealed many fundamental truths  about the political process if not necessarily swaying my opinion about the  ideology.All that aside, the film is extremely funny.  Of particular  note is the performance of Oliver Platt who is absolutely hilarious.  Whether it's delivering some self serving oration or just displaying  certain mannerisms he was superb.  Halle Berry gives a credible performance  although nothing I would consider particular outstanding.

457184,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6305265623,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 7]","When Warren Beatty's ""Bulworth"" was first released it was the most acclaimed film of the year. Nowadays, few people even see it. Sad, since this was one of the best films of that year. A truly original, fresh, and hilarious piece of filmmaking from a very unlikely source. The movie was directed, produced, co-written, and stars Warren Beatty, an actor not known for his rapping skills or connection with the black community. Watching the film, I can't believe Beatty wrote it. He seems like the most unlikely person to do a film like this, but he pulled it off. Beatty plays California Senator Jay Bulworth, who is trying to be re-elected for the senate job but is being overshadowed by the Clinton re-election. Bulworth's life is a mess. His loving wife is actually more of an employee, a woman who is paid to be ""his wife"" but openly has affairs. Sensing his life is going nowhere fast, Bulworth takes out a $10 million dollar life insurance policy and than orders a contract hit on his own life. Deciding that in his final days he's going to do what he wants, he begins hanging out in Compton and connecting with the black people he has neglected for so long. Pretty soon, he falls for a young black woman named Nina (Halle Berry) and decides he wants to cancel the hit. Problem is, that's a lot easier said than done. As his chief advisor Dennis (Oliver Platt) desperately tries to get Bulworth to pull himself together, they find that his popularity is shooting up in the polls. I'm not sure Beatty's exact age, but had to be 60 or pushing 60 when he made this film and that's a lot of the reason this film is so funny. There are several scenes in the film, in which Beatty puts on ""gangsta"" clothing (beanies, baggy pants, etc.) and begins rapping. That's right, rapping. If you don't find the idea of Warren Beatty rapping hilarious than you should see some movies like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" to see how someone could find this funny. But not only is he rapping, but he's making serious and relevant political points as he's doing it. Kind of like Zack de la Rocha, just not as talented. Sure, Beatty's not a good rapper but the stuff he's saying is just as relevant now as it was 9 years ago. ""Bulworth"" is a terrific film, one of the best that Beatty has directed. It's got a great cast, great dialogue, and it's hilarious (picture the Robin Williams vehicle ""Man of the Year"" if the script knew what direction it was going in from the start and if Williams had started rapping).

It wasn't because it's a great film, for it's not. It wasn't because it set some kind of benchmark in political filmmaking.Why was it? Clearly, it was because Warren Beatty spoke for all of Hollywoods Democrats in the year this film was released, 1998, which was the pinnacle of then president Bill Clinton's lying, impeachment, and sexual escapades.So the contrast of the Beatty character -- a Democrat that suddenly turns around and tells the truth at fundraisers, begins singing in rap, and takes up with black chicks -- is what gave this movie its topicality at the end of the 1990s.Seen most of a decade later as art, not current political commentary, this is a funny movie but hardly a great one. The plot, it seems to me, is copied almost completely from the far more successful ""Network"" of 1976.While ""Network"" lampooned television news, this one lampoons politics. While ""Network"" featured an overwrought, burned out Walter Cronkite type that turns around, tells it like it is and becomes a national folk hero, ""Bulworth"" features a burned out U.S. senator that suddenly quits using bull as his message and starts telling the truth. While the hero of ""Netowrk"" is essentially killed because he got bad ratings, the hero of this movie finds a similar end.So this movie, while still somewhat topical, will be completely alien to the political landscape in the next 10 years. At that points it's only interest will be the place in plays in Warren Beatty's filmography. I don't think it will ever be the equal of his better films and it will certainly never compete with his portrayal of Lucky Luciano or his salad day films as sex symbol in the 1970s.So watch this one soon before its message becomes completely irrelevant!",3,More like 3 1/2 stars,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1843,"['read', 'film', 'years', 'seeing', 'Now', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'talk', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'kind', 'benchmark', 'political', 'filmmaking.Why', 'was', 'Clearly', 'was', 'because', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'spoke', 'Hollywoods', 'Democrats', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1998', 'was', 'pinnacle', 'then', 'president', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'lying', 'impeachment', 'sexual', 'escapades.So', 'contrast', 'Beatty', 'character', 'Democrat', 'suddenly', 'around', 'truth', 'fundraisers', 'singing', 'rap', 'up', 'black', 'chicks', 'what', 'gave', 'movie', 'topicality', 'end', '1990s.Seen', 'most', 'decade', 'later', 'art', 'not', 'current', 'political', 'commentary', 'funny', 'movie', 'hardly', 'great', 'one', 'plot', 'copied', 'almost', 'completely', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'Network', '1976.While', 'Network', 'lampooned', 'television', 'news', 'one', 'lampoons', 'politics', 'Network', 'featured', 'overwrought', 'burned', 'out', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'type', 'around', 'national', 'folk', 'hero', 'Bulworth', 'burned', 'out', 'U.S.', 'senator', 'suddenly', 'using', 'bull', 'message', 'telling', 'truth', 'hero', 'Netowrk', 'essentially', 'killed', 'got', 'bad', 'ratings', 'hero', 'movie', 'similar', 'end.So', 'movie', 'still', 'somewhat', 'topical', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'alien', 'political', 'landscape', 'next', '10', 'years', 'only', 'interest', 'will', 'be', 'place', 'plays', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'filmography', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'equal', 'better', 'films', 'will', 'certainly', 'never', 'compete', 'portrayal', 'Lucky', 'Luciano', 'salad', 'day', 'films', 'sex', 'symbol', '1970s.So', 'watch', 'one', 'soon', 'message', 'completely', 'irrelevant']",N/A

457193,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305265623,Matthew Horner,"[17, 18]","Once a prolific superstar, the still bankable Warren Beatty had made just nine movies in the last decade. Three of these have earned him three Oscar nominations and one win. In the 1970s and 1980s, he ranked among the top ten playboys in American. His conquests were legendary. Some of his movies were steamy by the standards of their time. Now over sixty years old, he seems more than happily married to Annette Bening. He has reached the point where he can make movies that interest him. Perhaps we should make that ones which amuse him.Bulworth may have been the most singularly eccentric big budget movie of 1998. It's about a politician, but whereas Primary Colors stayed within a defined framework, Bulworth is all over the map. Yet, depending on your sense of humor, it may be the funniest political satire you will see for some time to come.Beatty is Jay Billington Bulworth, a United States senator from California who is up for yet another term. The time is 1996. As the movie notes, Clinton is running unopposed, and Dole is definitely going to get the Republican nomination. The public is unaroused, which means that the political climate is completely status quo. Meanwhile, Bulworth is about to have one heck of a nervous breakdown.The reason Bulworth goes bananas is never specifically stated, but the implication is that the games, deceptions and deceits that make up modern politics have finally undone him. In deep despair, he gets ten million dollars worth of life insurance and promptly arranges for his own assassination. The next day, he changes his mind. He spends the rest of the moving running both for office and for his life.He goes to fund raisers and insults his wealthy backers. He attends a church in Compton and tells his black audience that they are never going to get any help from Washington, because lower income people are only exploited by the big businesses that pay to get politicians elected. He becomes outrageously incorrect politically. The media, of course, always looking for a hot story, embraces him.There's that hit man to be avoided. We see groups of reporters following Bulworth, who hasn't slept in days. A car backfires. Bulworth starts walking very fast, and then breaks into a run. The reporters run after him. This is a visual sight gag that is hysterical. Sometimes, he makes a getaway by driving off in his big black limo. Such a vehicle looks ridiculous in a chase scene, to say the least.Beneath the sometimes dark comedy, Bulworth has a lot of insightful and painful comments to may about our often hypocritical and ineffectual government. These observations are made satirically, but effectively. This is not a heavy-handed work.One thing that hampered Bulworth at the boxoffice was its portrayal of the man in the black community. People didn't get it. They were offended, especially many liberal white people. Beatty was in no way making fun of African-Americans by showing a very streetwise group. His point, which I thought was fairly obvious, was that many people will behave in an antisocial way in a society that is largely indifferent and often hostile towards them. I think that's almost a no-brainer. Bulworth is that rare politician who has soul.I have never been fond of politics, perhaps because I grew up around a lot of good old boy politicians.

Nevermind, it's actually pretty obvious.Far from being the deft parody of modern civics that the producers obviously intended, this is an extremely silly movie that trivializes major problems, and frequently borders on being racist, classist, and anti-semitic.One problem is that this was Warren Beatty's attempt at being &quot;hip&quot; and reaching out to a whole new generation.  Well, I'm part of that generation and let me tell you that it just came out as being creepy and pathetic.  Warren Beatty and Halley Berry?  &quot;Ew&quot; on so many different levels.

The young, socially aware people that I know think that this movie is paternalistic, insulting, and stupid: and that Warren Beatty should just deal with the fact that he is no longer Hollywood's #1 Heart-throb.

Infact I suggest that the world's prostitutes form a union and  sue those cynics. A prostitute will sell her body and admit it, a  politician will sell his soul and lie about it.As we join Senator J.  Billington Bulworth (Warren Beatty) he is in a morbid state of depression.  He is so depressed that he takes out a 10 million dollar life insurance  policy and hires a hitman to kill him. Now in his supposed final weekend on  earth, he discovers that since he is a dead man anyway he may as well tell  the truth about the sordid business of politics. He does away with the  ludicrously phoney speeches and gives it to everybody straight, exposing  the obvious fact that seems to ellude the public, that politicians are  available to the highest bidder. Beatty's central(and obvious) argument  here is that since politicians are in dire need of expensive &quot;30  second spots&quot;, they will do anything for the companies that pay for  their campaigns. This is not news to anyone with half a brain, but since  the JFK assasination people still don't seem to comprehend just how  powerful the corperate world is in the political arena.An accurate  critique of the campaign finance in America then, but the reason why  Bulworth is both a hilarious and riveting experience is its no holds barred  honesty. Bulworth's remarks inspire a &quot;Did he really say what I think  he said reaction&quot;, the shock of his constituents is shared by the  audience. One particular scene that I had to replay three times because I  was laughing so hard was his rhyming, profane and deeply honest interview  with a stunned network anchor. That electrifying scene alone makes the film  worth repeated viewings.The photography by the legendary Vittorio  Storaro (who shot Apocalypse Now) supplies a moody and slightly oppressive  atmosphere. The colours on screen are a character all their own, and to be  honest I didn't like them, the lighting is just a little too dark. But then  Beatty isn't making an out and out comedy here. I guess the bleak atmoshere  is central to the films ultimately depressing message.Bulworth stands  as one of the sharpest anti-establishment films of the 1990s, almost equal  in its scathing attack on the system as Oliver Stone's JFK, except funnier.  It is by no means a perfect film, the ending feels out of sink with what  has gone on before and Beatty often repeats himself, but as a whole it  suceeds as a jaw dropping satire. It is also the first film in history to  suggest a real and tangible solution to the problem of racial  discrimination.",4,What the world needs now is......suicidal politicians,958867200,"05 21, 2000",2000,2651,"['cynics', 'often', 'compare', 'politicians', 'whores', ""'m"", 'even', 'more', 'jaded', 'then', 'Infact', 'suggest', 'world', 'prostitutes', 'form', 'union', 'sue', 'cynics', 'prostitute', 'will', 'sell', 'body', 'admit', 'politician', 'will', 'sell', 'soul', 'lie', 'about', 'it.As', 'join', 'Senator', 'J.', 'Billington', 'Bulworth', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'morbid', 'state', 'depression', 'so', 'depressed', 'out', '10', 'million', 'dollar', 'life', 'insurance', 'policy', 'hitman', 'kill', 'Now', 'supposed', 'final', 'weekend', 'earth', 'dead', 'man', 'anyway', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'truth', 'sordid', 'business', 'politics', 'away', 'ludicrously', 'phoney', 'speeches', 'everybody', 'straight', 'exposing', 'obvious', 'fact', 'ellude', 'public', 'politicians', 'are', 'available', 'highest', 'bidder', 'Beatty', 'central', 'obvious', 'argument', 'here', 'politicians', 'are', 'dire', 'need', 'expensive', 'quot', '30', 'second', 'spots', 'quot', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'companies', 'pay', 'campaigns', 'not', 'news', 'anyone', 'brain', 'JFK', 'assasination', 'people', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comprehend', 'just', 'how', 'powerful', 'corperate', 'world', 'political', 'arena.An', 'accurate', 'critique', 'campaign', 'finance', 'America', 'then', 'reason', 'why', 'Bulworth', 'hilarious', 'riveting', 'experience', 'barred', 'honesty', 'Bulworth', 'remarks', 'inspire', 'quot', 'Did', 'really', 'say', 'what', 'think', 'said', 'reaction', 'quot', 'shock', 'constituents', 'shared', 'audience', 'One', 'particular', 'scene', 'had', 'replay', 'three', 'times', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'rhyming', 'profane', 'deeply', 'honest', 'interview', 'stunned', 'network', 'anchor', 'electrifying', 'scene', 'alone', 'film', 'worth', 'repeated', 'viewings.The', 'photography', 'legendary', 'Vittorio', 'Storaro', 'who', 'shot', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'moody', 'slightly', 'oppressive', 'atmosphere', 'colours', 'screen', 'are', 'character', 'own', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'lighting', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'then', 'Beatty', ""n't"", 'making', 'out', 'comedy', 'here', 'guess', 'bleak', 'central', 'films', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'message.Bulworth', 'stands', 'one', 'sharpest', 'anti-establishment', 'films', '1990s', 'almost', 'equal', 'scathing', 'attack', 'system', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'funnier', 'perfect', 'film', 'ending', 'feels', 'sink', 'what', 'gone', 'Beatty', 'often', 'whole', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'satire', 'also', 'first', 'film', 'history', 'suggest', 'real', 'tangible', 'solution', 'problem', 'racial', 'discrimination']",N/A

Few others would have been in a position to make this movie.Senator Bulworth is running for re-election at the same time that he has a nervous breakdown. As corporate America queues up to buy his influence, his liberal past gazes down with disapproval at him from the photos on the wall - Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy. Sickened by the way he has sold out to the power elite, he arranges for his assassination so that his daughter can claim the life insurance. Once this is set up and he is dragged around the election circuit, he feels a great weight off his shoulders and he starts speaking his mind rather than the usual platitudes: He tells audiences that he acts for corporate America because they have the money - the people don't; medicine will never be socialised in America because the insurance corporations want to hold on to their profits; and government will never act on behalf of black people because black people lack all financial clout.Pretty radical stuff. Unfortunately, Bulworth is not good cinema. The story is hackneyed and unbelievable. It's basically a third rate thriller with left-wing politics dumped into it. The Battle of Algiers it is not.

And he  decides to take drastic measures to do something about it, in ""Bulworth,""  one of the finest political satires ever made, written and directed by and  starring Warren Beatty.  Once he makes his personal commitment to ""change,""  J. Billington Bulworth (Beatty) hits the campaign trail and wreaks havoc as  he levels the playing field by introducing a unique concept into the  political arena:  Truth and honesty.  He proceeds to single-handedly give  political incorrectness new definition; and no one is safe as he launches  his barrage against every possible bastion of former untouchables, from big  business, big money and the entertainment industry, to invasive, unethical  media, to unemployment and welfare.  Before he's through he gets up close  and personal with his constituents in South Central L.A., gets down with  the brothers (not to mention the sisters) and, much to the chagrin of his  campaign manager, Murphy (Oliver Platt), he begins to ""rhyme"" (rap) his  speech.  It's politics like you've never seen it before, in fact or  fiction, and it's an exhilarating sight to behold.  Beatty really hits  his mark as the politician whose monumental decision to play a reversal of  ""Faust"" gives him new energy and new life, the only downside being that he  must also deal with consequences of the inevitable outcome of the ""Weekend  research project"" he has so (as he begins to think) imprudently initiated.  It's a dynamic performance underscored with nuance and infused with  Beatty's own charismatic personality, which he successfully gives over to  the character entirely.  It's tough not to like Bulworth; he has flash, a  winning smile and almost a sense of wonderment that carries him along as he  addresses issues head-on and dead-on, like what is more obscene, the  four-letter words he uses to make his point, or the ever widening gap  between the rich and the middle class, with rising unemployment caused by  big-moneyed conglomerates locating on foreign land in order to jack up  prices and profits, while decimating the economic base of the working class  here at home.  It's a full-out frontal assault, and Bulworth pulls no  punches as he manages to insult and alienate just about everyone around  him; and overnight, he gains in the polls like never before.  Beatty the  actor ""is"" Bulworth the politician, and you've just got to like this guy.  Oliver Platt, who has emerged as one of the finest character actors in  recent memory (in the same company as William H. Macy, Philip Seymour  Hoffman, Kevin Corrigan and Steve Buscemi), plays the young,  upwardly-mobile professional Murphy to the hilts; he plays it straight,  which makes his confused reactions to Bulworth's sudden change in direction  very real and absolutely hilarious.  He makes Murphy a truly memorable  character.  Halle Berry (Nina) is outstanding as well, giving a performance  of sultry intensity that makes the screen sizzle. There's real chemistry  between her and Beatty, and the intelligence she brings to the character of  this young woman from the `hood is refreshing; it avoids any hint of  stereotype, which adds to the overall credibility of the proceedings.  A supporting cast made in cinematic heaven includes Jack Warden (Eddie),  Christine Baranski (Constance), Sean Astin (Gary), Don Cheadle (L.D.), Nora  Dunn (Missy), Paul Sorvino (Graham), Isaiah Washington (Darnell) and Laurie  Metcalf (Mimi).  With ""Bulworth.""

457204,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,6305265623,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","Weeks away from his imminent re election Jay Billington Bulworth (Warren Beatty) hires an assassin to take him out. He has lost his faith in politics and can't bring himself to appear before his supporters and spout the same old speeches full of lies. Knowing that his time is limited Bulworth feels invincible and starts telling his version of the truth at his last few campaign stops. First up for the Senator is an all black church. He gets up to the pulpit reads the first sentence from his prepared speech and then goes hilariously off the script. What he says is both hilarious and shocking. One of the women in the crowd the beautiful Nina (Halle Berry) can't believe what she's hearing and waits for the Senator as he's leaving. Her and her two friends want to be campaign volunteers. His top advisor (a hilarious Oliver Platt) hesitantly gets their information and by the time Bulworth arrives at his next stop they are already working as valets. His next meeting is with Hollywood insiders and that ends by the Senator chastising them for wanting so much money and making so much crap. He also calls them  a bunch of Jews. Bulworth is having the time of his life but his aides are besides themselves. They go into serious crisis control and begin issuing statements about the Senator's poor mental health. Bulworth spots Nina and offers her and her friends a ride. Nina decides to take the Senator to a hip hop club. After they go through the metal detectors Nina takes off leaving Bulworth to wander around on his own. He smokes a joint, gets mistaken for George Hamilton by a bartender, and starts rapping. From this point on Beatty raps all of Bulworth's speeches. After Nina gets back her and Bulworth dance into the early morning hours when he realizes that he has to give a speech at a lunch. When a rumpled Bulworth shows up at the banquet and delivers a tirade about big oil, health insurance, and the media in a rap that he made up on the spot everyone thinks he's lost it. The raps are clever and often funny but the joke gets old quick. Beatty is brave to go all out for this role complete with hop hop clothes knowing that some people will find it an embarrassing move by an old white guy. This is the film's biggest problem. It is an uneven mix of political satire and a man's immersion into black culture that feels awkward and potentially offensive whenever the jokes don't pan out. Beatty throws a very questionable character into the mix as well. He is a homeless black man that magically appears at all of the Senator's campaign stops and mutters some gibberish to Bulworth. He's hilarious don't get me wrong but why is he here? The last act of the film is more of the same. Nina takes Bulworth to South Central where she hides him with her family. In South Central his eyes are opened to kids as young as 13 walking the streets with guns and selling drugs. Bulworth learns that they work for a neighborhood dealer named L.D. (Don Cheadle). When Bulworth confronts him he explains to the Senator that he is doing these kids a public service since no one else would take a chance on them and give them a job. He laments the lack of education in public schools and how they are underfunded and says that that is why so many kids are choosing an easy life of crime. Bulworth takes these words to heart as they appear in his next rap on his final campaign stop an interview on live T.V.. Valid points are being brought up throughout the film although the message is lost in their questionable delivery. The other distracting problem is the identity of the hit man. At several points we see a gloved hand spiking drinks or loosening balcony railings. When the real hit man is identified it doesn't add up. The ending is a major disappointment and an easy way out. Beatty even has the audacity to stage it like a political assassination of the 60's. This film has a lot that works however. Beatty and Berry have a terrific chemistry between them. This is in evidence during their hot dance in the club. Oliver Platt is so entertaining as Bulworth's top adviser who is losing his mind. Fed up and unable to cope he starts snorting coke and lashing out at the press and anyone else who questions the Senator's behavior. According to IMDB West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin and writer/director James Toback (a very close Beatty friend) did a lot of uncredited rewrites to the script which was Oscar nominated. Bulworth is a great movie that just leaves a few too many loose ends and that let's the gimmick go on a little too long.",3,Very smart and funny but also very frustrating,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,4545,"['Weeks', 'away', 'imminent', 're', 'election', 'Jay', 'Billington', 'Bulworth', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'assassin', 'take', 'out', 'lost', 'faith', 'politics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'appear', 'supporters', 'spout', 'same', 'old', 'speeches', 'full', 'lies', 'Knowing', 'time', 'limited', 'Bulworth', 'feels', 'invincible', 'telling', 'version', 'truth', 'last', 'few', 'campaign', 'stops', 'First', 'up', 'Senator', 'black', 'church', 'up', 'pulpit', 'first', 'sentence', 'prepared', 'speech', 'then', 'hilariously', 'script', 'What', 'hilarious', 'shocking', 'One', 'women', 'crowd', 'beautiful', 'Nina', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'hearing', 'waits', 'Senator', 'leaving', 'two', 'friends', 'want', 'be', 'campaign', 'volunteers', 'top', 'advisor', 'hilarious', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'hesitantly', 'information', 'time', 'Bulworth', 'next', 'stop', 'are', 'already', 'working', 'valets', 'next', 'meeting', 'Hollywood', 'insiders', 'ends', 'Senator', 'chastising', 'wanting', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'making', 'so', 'much', 'crap', 'also', 'bunch', 'Jews', 'Bulworth', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'aides', 'are', 'go', 'serious', 'crisis', 'control', 'begin', 'issuing', 'statements', 'Senator', 'poor', 'mental', 'health', 'Bulworth', 'spots', 'Nina', 'friends', 'ride', 'Nina', 'take', 'Senator', 'hip', 'hop', 'club', 'go', 'metal', 'detectors', 'Nina', 'leaving', 'Bulworth', 'wander', 'around', 'own', 'joint', 'mistaken', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'bartender', 'rapping', 'point', 'Beatty', 'raps', 'Bulworth', 'speeches', 'Nina', 'back', 'Bulworth', 'dance', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', 'when', 'give', 'speech', 'lunch', 'When', 'rumpled', 'Bulworth', 'up', 'banquet', 'tirade', 'big', 'oil', 'health', 'insurance', 'media', 'rap', 'made', 'up', 'spot', 'everyone', 'lost', 'raps', 'are', 'clever', 'often', 'funny', 'joke', 'old', 'quick', 'Beatty', 'brave', 'go', 'out', 'role', 'complete', 'hop', 'hop', 'clothes', 'knowing', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'embarrassing', 'move', 'old', 'white', 'guy', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'uneven', 'mix', 'political', 'satire', 'man', 'immersion', 'black', 'culture', 'awkward', 'potentially', 'offensive', 'whenever', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'Beatty', 'very', 'questionable', 'character', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'homeless', 'black', 'man', 'magically', 'Senator', 'campaign', 'stops', 'mutters', 'gibberish', 'Bulworth', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'why', 'here', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'more', 'same', 'Nina', 'Bulworth', 'South', 'Central', 'where', 'family', 'South', 'Central', 'eyes', 'are', 'opened', 'kids', 'as', 'young', '13', 'walking', 'streets', 'guns', 'selling', 'drugs', 'Bulworth', 'work', 'neighborhood', 'dealer', 'named', 'L.D', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'When', 'Bulworth', 'confronts', 'Senator', 'doing', 'kids', 'public', 'service', 'one', 'else', 'would', 'take', 'chance', 'give', 'job', 'lack', 'education', 'public', 'schools', 'how', 'are', 'underfunded', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'are', 'choosing', 'easy', 'life', 'crime', 'Bulworth', 'words', 'heart', 'appear', 'next', 'rap', 'final', 'campaign', 'stop', 'interview', 'live', 'T.V..', 'Valid', 'points', 'are', 'being', 'brought', 'up', 'film', 'message', 'lost', 'questionable', 'delivery', 'other', 'distracting', 'problem', 'identity', 'hit', 'man', 'several', 'points', 'see', 'gloved', 'hand', 'spiking', 'drinks', 'loosening', 'balcony', 'railings', 'When', 'real', 'hit', 'man', 'identified', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'ending', 'major', 'disappointment', 'easy', 'way', 'Beatty', 'even', 'audacity', 'stage', 'political', 'assassination', '60', 'film', 'lot', 'however', 'Beatty', 'Berry', 'have', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'evidence', 'hot', 'dance', 'club', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'so', 'entertaining', 'Bulworth', 'top', 'adviser', 'who', 'losing', 'mind', 'Fed', 'up', 'unable', 'cope', 'snorting', 'coke', 'lashing', 'out', 'press', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'questions', 'Senator', 'behavior', 'According', 'IMDB', 'West', 'Wing', 'creator', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Toback', 'very', 'close', 'Beatty', 'friend', 'did', 'lot', 'uncredited', 'rewrites', 'script', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Bulworth', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'let', 'gimmick', 'go', 'little', 'too', 'long']",N/A

A california state senate candidate has a death wish, being disillusioned with the filthy shenanigans of politics. Instead of committing suicide he plots his own assassination. Given his imminent death he gives himself a free reign during his final speech in the african-american rally in LA where he answers a question about ""Where are your promises of insurance benefits for us black people?"" with an unadorned tirade -- ""Why should you guys matter? 50% of your kids are unemployed, and the other 50% are in jail"". This is followed by an utterly irreverent anti-Semitic take during a meeting with media barons (all Jewish, of course).Such whimsical behavior in fact leaves the senator feeling so liberated that his death wish vanishes, and the movie turns into a frantic chase to track down his anointed assassin and cancel the plans. This lends the movie some of its hilarious moments and what could even have been an adorable pace.But the movie and its pace are thrown to the wind as we quickly get swamped with empathetic odes to negro stereotypes -- young black kids under 10 years of age selling dope on the streets using F-words as punctuation, abject poverty (15 people in a small shoddy home for e.g.), rusty cars from 1625 A.D. for the black folk but Rolls limos for everyone else, white cops badgering the afrincan-american drug salesmen and the kids of course replying in an F-laden rants with allusion to parental family members etc etc.As though this was not enough, a dreadful overdose of rap music  compounds our woes (no no, I love rap music with a capital C) with the possible exception of Ghetto Superstar (yeah). Even the senator develops a rap-tongue and cannot seem to speak in anything but rhyme, whether on TV or in private tete-a-tetes with Halle Berry.Beatty's wrinkles show up in this movie but do little to add to his expressionless expressions, although he is convincing in his role. Halle Berry is confident as usual, but in her african-women-can-be-intelligent-too anti-stereotype role, seems to have a medical inability to smile because, clearly, intelligent people are always serious. The senator's chief of staff campaigner has a perpetual frown with all this bizzare callousness, which is somewhat grating. Everyone else does his/her job well - no more no less.Overall, a unique theme with a lot of promise that could easily have been a 5/5 material had Beatty not been so smitten with his inane takes on the minority agenda.

Not only as the title character, but co-writer, producer, and director of a film that for all exstensive purposes, should not get made in today's modern P.C. (pretend un-P.C.) Hollywood climate. As a writer is where Warren really shows his talent, creating a quick, rich, unrelenting script that is at times satire, comedy, and political anthem all at once.Bulworth is the name of central character Jay Billingsly Bulworth, a California Democrat who has recently forsaken his long-standing leftist beliefs for the sake of reelection in 1996. When we meet Bulworth, he is suffering somewhere between a nervous breakdown and a crisis of conscious over his new path and life which eventually leads him to arrange his own assasination. When that assasination fails to occur on time, Bulworth, forced to continue his routine, begans to publicly unravel his reputation and political career by speaking truths about the state of modern affirs and politics. Essentially telling a black church that promises made in the wake of the L.A. riots were no more than photo-ops, and that we were unimportant because they didn't contribute money to his campaign.Eventually, Bulworth begins to enjoy his new-found frankness, telling a bunch of Hollywood Moguls (in a wonderful scene by a lamenting star from the old system) that they made garbage and were only on his stop because they were &quot;Jews&quot;. Thus continues his travels as he makes friends with several ghetto-females from South Central, one of which (Halle Berry) he begins to fall in love with despite her somewhat shady secret. Before long, with a new leash on life, Bulworth regrets the decision to take his life, and tries to undo the assasination, all the while watching his new political approach have a startling positive affect at the polls.Bulworth mainly consist of decidly leftist beliefs (almost socialistic) which may turn off political opposites. But the theme of both the failure of modern politics, as well as the aching loss of black leadership is one that should be appreciated by all. When you throw in the great laughs and touching views of an elder statesman of Hollywood, with a wonderful soundtrack featuring Ice-Cube, Public Enemy, Mack 10 and others, what you are left with is a completely unique and enjoyable film experience.",4,Ghetto-Fabulous,1023062400,"06 3, 2002",2002,2339,"['star', 'Bulworth', 'Warren', 'Beaty', 'Not', 'only', 'title', 'character', 'co-writer', 'producer', 'director', 'film', 'exstensive', 'purposes', 'should', 'not', 'get', 'made', 'today', 'modern', 'P.C', 'pretend', 'un-P.C', 'Hollywood', 'climate', 'writer', 'where', 'Warren', 'really', 'talent', 'creating', 'quick', 'rich', 'unrelenting', 'script', 'times', 'satire', 'comedy', 'political', 'anthem', 'once.Bulworth', 'name', 'central', 'character', 'Jay', 'Billingsly', 'Bulworth', 'California', 'Democrat', 'who', 'recently', 'forsaken', 'long-standing', 'leftist', 'beliefs', 'sake', 'reelection', '1996', 'When', 'meet', 'Bulworth', 'suffering', 'somewhere', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'crisis', 'conscious', 'new', 'path', 'life', 'eventually', 'arrange', 'own', 'assasination', 'When', 'assasination', 'occur', 'time', 'Bulworth', 'forced', 'continue', 'routine', 'begans', 'publicly', 'unravel', 'reputation', 'political', 'career', 'speaking', 'truths', 'state', 'modern', 'affirs', 'politics', 'Essentially', 'telling', 'black', 'church', 'made', 'wake', 'L.A.', 'riots', 'were', 'more', 'photo-ops', 'were', 'unimportant', 'did', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'money', 'campaign.Eventually', 'Bulworth', 'enjoy', 'new-found', 'frankness', 'telling', 'bunch', 'Hollywood', 'Moguls', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'lamenting', 'star', 'old', 'system', 'made', 'garbage', 'were', 'only', 'stop', 'were', 'quot', 'Jews', 'quot', 'Thus', 'travels', 'friends', 'several', 'ghetto-females', 'South', 'Central', 'one', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'fall', 'love', 'somewhat', 'shady', 'secret', 'long', 'new', 'leash', 'life', 'Bulworth', 'decision', 'take', 'life', 'tries', 'undo', 'assasination', 'while', 'watching', 'new', 'political', 'approach', 'have', 'startling', 'positive', 'affect', 'polls.Bulworth', 'mainly', 'consist', 'decidly', 'leftist', 'beliefs', 'almost', 'socialistic', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'political', 'opposites', 'theme', 'failure', 'modern', 'politics', 'as', 'well', 'aching', 'loss', 'black', 'leadership', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'When', 'throw', 'great', 'laughs', 'touching', 'views', 'elder', 'statesman', 'Hollywood', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Ice-Cube', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Mack', '10', 'others', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'completely', 'unique', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'experience']",N/A

He insults African Americans who blindly support OJ Simpson and need to ""put down their chicken and malt liquor.""  He even goes after rich Hollywood Jewish producers.  It is highly amusing that conservatives would hate this movie so much.  Perhaps it is because Beatty has given us an example of a liberal who could actually win elections?In a post 2004 election world Bulworth is a cathartic escape.  Forget the slimy politicians of the DLC (Democratic Leadership Council) or the blindly ideological liberal activist base who don't have a clue about electoral politics.  Here's a man who states the truth and STILL supports progressive goals.In one interview after Bulworth was released in theaters Beatty commented that the film had only one ending and nothing else was possible.  Ultimately, the old adage: ""the charismatic liberal leader will always be destroyed.""  Given the lack of heroic leadership within the Democratic Party it's hard to say if this the truth or not - we simply don't have any examples!Bulworth will no doubt go down in history as one of the best politically progressive films ever made.  Yes, it's that good.  Not despite Beatty's old white man rapping persona - perhaps because of it.While the film is destined to be a classic, this DVD is a severe disappointment.  How could a movie with so much social and political importance have no DVD extras?  There's not even a commentary track let alone a behind the scenes documentary!  It's possible that the studios were simply trying to be as apolitical as possible.  A recent re-release of ""Three Kings"" (another superb liberal film) excluded a documentary by director David Russell because it was supposedly too political.  So perhaps the studios are willing to sell us these liberal movies.  They just aren't willing to allow their makers to come forward and state their political views.
