The one and only ""Fess Parker"", was truly the best choice for this role, like he was as Davy Crockett. The stories are interesting with plenty of action, and it makes you feel like you were actually living back in those times.You won't go wrong in purchasing this series.What a Boone, what a doer, what a dream come truer, was he!John",5,"Daniel Boone, ""A  wonderful series"".",1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,423,"['was', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'show', 'frontier', 'life', 'nice', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'one', 'only', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'was', 'truly', 'best', 'choice', 'role', 'was', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'plenty', 'action', 'feel', 'were', 'actually', 'living', 'back', 'times.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'purchasing', 'Boone', 'what', 'doer', 'what', 'dream', 'come', 'truer', 'was', 'John']",Daniel Boone - Season Four

1068397,AFE0AGQT50MBJ,B000P2XMJ4,KV Trout,"[18, 19]","I love this series!However, while I give Seasons 2 and 3 Five Stars (Season 1 had not yet hit a stride), this Season (4) has some problems:1) The writing just isn't as good as the previous 2 seasons. Too much Israel Boone, and too much of the same type of story with the British, and too many ""unbelievable"" situations. Sometimes Boone is made to look like a weakling while Israel saves his life! Give me a break.2) The audio is out of sync on these episodes sometimes. Funny because on one of the Bonus Features they talk about how much care the put into cleaning up the audio and video. As someone in the industry I can tell you that there is no excuse for not having the audio sync up, it's just sloppiness. Someone did not do their job correctly and no one supervised to check and fix it.3) Jemimah Boone just disappears with no explanation. No great loss, but kind of annoying when people just disappear.4) Mingo is not in enough episodes.#1 above is the MAIN problem, though - the others are just minor problems.I would recommend this season only if you're a completist and want to have the entire collection. If you're only buying one or two sets, buy season 2 and season 3.I don't know how Seasons after this are, I haven't seen them. Hopefully it does not go further downhill, but usually once a series begins to ""jump the shark"", there is no going back... And I'd say it jumped the shark in Season 4.",3,Not as good as previous seasons,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1410,"['love', 'series', 'However', 'give', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'Five', 'Stars', 'Season', '1', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'hit', 'stride', 'Season', '4', 'problems:1', 'writing', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'previous', '2', 'seasons', 'Too', 'much', 'Israel', 'Boone', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'type', 'story', 'British', 'too', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'situations', 'Sometimes', 'Boone', 'made', 'look', 'weakling', 'Israel', 'life', 'Give', 'break.2', 'audio', 'sync', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'Funny', 'one', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'talk', 'how', 'much', 'care', 'put', 'cleaning', 'up', 'audio', 'video', 'someone', 'industry', 'can', 'tell', 'excuse', 'not', 'having', 'audio', 'sync', 'up', 'just', 'sloppiness', 'Someone', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'job', 'correctly', 'one', 'supervised', 'check', 'fix', 'it.3', 'Jemimah', 'Boone', 'just', 'explanation', 'great', 'loss', 'kind', 'annoying', 'when', 'people', 'just', 'disappear.4', 'Mingo', 'not', 'enough', 'episodes.', '1', 'above', 'MAIN', 'problem', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'minor', 'problems.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'season', 'only', ""'re"", 'completist', 'want', 'have', 'entire', 'collection', ""'re"", 'only', 'buying', 'one', 'two', 'sets', 'buy', 'season', '2', 'season', '3.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Seasons', 'are', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Hopefully', 'not', 'go', 'further', 'downhill', 'usually', 'once', 'series', 'jump', 'shark', 'going', 'back', ""'d"", 'say', 'jumped', 'shark', 'Season', '4']",Daniel Boone - Season Four

1068400,A5NKC5NBCE6EM,B000P2XMJ4,Philip,"[0, 0]","I can't get enough of DB. I am finishing the 4th season and I love it. A lot of the episodes are not solely based at Boonesborough KY and I like that variety. There are a lot of special guests: Movie and TV stars which are also enjoyable. The quality of the scripts does vary from good to excellent. Unfortunately we do lose Mingo due to Ed Ames soaring as a voice recording star. Fess Parker said in the ""Bonus"" segments in the DB series that he very much missed working with Ed as Mingo and would have liked to have him finish the series with him, but that he fully understood why Ed Ames had to maximize his singing talent and the financial opportunity it brought. I believe that Ed Ames was and is unique in being as good an actor as he is a singer. You probably guessed right I love the Mingo episodes especially when he sings, WOW! I look forward to the remaining seasons which I now own. There will never be another DVD series collection like this that had a moral base of loving your neighbor as yourself and all the character that helped make American an exceptionally great country where a person's word was their bond regardless if it cost them or not. This entire series is great entertainment for families. I am looking for more older TV that I can get into having already done the original Hawaii 50 10 seasons, and all of Magnum PI. I hope that Warner Brothers digitizes ""Hawaiian Eye"" another great series as a predecessor to 50 and Magnum. If you would like to see ""Hawaiin Eye"" please search the TV titles for the same and chose to be notified when it becomes available. The more people like you do this the more leverage you give Amazon to get Warner Brothers to relase ""Hawaiian Eye"".  Aloha, Mahalo!Hope this helps.Regards,Philip",5,Daniel Boone An Every Night Favorite at my house......,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,1750,"['ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'DB', 'am', 'finishing', '4th', 'season', 'love', 'lot', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'solely', 'based', 'Boonesborough', 'KY', 'like', 'variety', 'are', 'lot', 'special', 'guests', 'Movie', 'TV', 'stars', 'are', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'quality', 'scripts', 'vary', 'good', 'excellent', 'Unfortunately', 'do', 'lose', 'Mingo', 'due', 'Ed', 'Ames', 'soaring', 'voice', 'recording', 'star', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'said', 'Bonus', 'segments', 'DB', 'series', 'very', 'much', 'missed', 'working', 'Ed', 'Mingo', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'finish', 'series', 'fully', 'understood', 'why', 'Ed', 'Ames', 'had', 'maximize', 'singing', 'talent', 'financial', 'opportunity', 'brought', 'believe', 'Ed', 'Ames', 'was', 'unique', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'actor', 'singer', 'probably', 'guessed', 'right', 'love', 'Mingo', 'episodes', 'especially', 'when', 'WOW', 'look', 'forward', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'now', 'own', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'DVD', 'series', 'collection', 'had', 'moral', 'base', 'loving', 'neighbor', 'character', 'helped', 'make', 'American', 'exceptionally', 'great', 'country', 'where', 'person', 'word', 'was', 'bond', 'regardless', 'cost', 'not', 'entire', 'series', 'great', 'entertainment', 'families', 'am', 'looking', 'more', 'older', 'TV', 'can', 'get', 'having', 'already', 'done', 'original', 'Hawaii', '50', '10', 'seasons', 'Magnum', 'PI', 'hope', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Hawaiian', 'Eye', 'great', 'series', 'predecessor', '50', 'Magnum', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Hawaiin', 'Eye', 'please', 'search', 'TV', 'titles', 'same', 'chose', 'be', 'notified', 'when', 'available', 'more', 'people', 'do', 'more', 'leverage', 'give', 'Amazon', 'get', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'relase', 'Hawaiian', 'Eye', 'Aloha', 'Mahalo', 'Hope', 'helps.Regards', 'Philip']",Daniel Boone - Season Four
