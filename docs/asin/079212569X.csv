125111,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,079212569X,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[1, 1]","Patriot Games, the second film in the Jack Ryan series, stars Harrison Ford as Tom Clancy's central character in a tale about heroism and vengeance set against the backdrop of the Irish ""troubles.""Like the other film adaptations of Clancy's novels, Patriot Games takes the core of the book's plot while at the same time tweaking it to make the movie fit a certain amount of running time and ""pump up"" the action to attract large audiences who may or may not be too familiar with the novel.Patriot Games fiddles with the established chronology of the Jack Ryan novels by moving the timeline forward rather than backward.  In the universe depicted by Tom Clancy, Patriot Games takes place before The Hunt for Red October.  In that novel, there were several offhand references to the as-yet unfinished and unpublished Patriot Games (one character refers to Jack as ""Sir John"" early on, while later someone recalls a high-profile incident involving Ryan and some terrorists in London).  Had Alec Baldwin signed on to do this film, maybe Games-as-prequel could have been done, but when Ford accepted the role of CIA analyst Ryan, his age and looks precluded this notion.As in the novel, Jack Ryan is in London on a working vacation with his wife Cathy (Ann Archer) and daughter Sally (Thora Birch).  While on his way to join his family on a sightseeing walk, Ryan literally runs into an Irish armed group's ambush on Lord Howe (James Fox) and his wife as they are driving on a London street.  Without hesitating, Ryan falls back on to his Marine/CIA training and foils the attack, killing two of the attackers, one of whom is uber-terrorist Sean Miller's (Sean Bean) younger brother.  Although he, too, is wounded, Ryan testifies in court against Miller and sets off a chain of vendetta-upon-vendetta that will lead to Ryan's return to the CIA and a Moby Dick-like obsessive quest for revenge on Miller's part.Viewed purely on its merits as a movie, Patriot Games works well.  Ford steps into the Ryan role effortlessly (ironic, since he had turned down Hunt for Red October, citing he did not want to another action movie where his character had very little interaction with his family), thus earning his reputation as ""the thinking man's action hero.""  His scenes with the lovely Ann Archer are totally believable, and his character's motivations (""Not for honor. Not for country. For his wife and child."") gives the audience a more human and vulnerable hero to root for than Ryan's antithesis, James Bond.  Samuel L. Jackson appears here early in his career as Ryan's best friend, Navy pilot Robby Jackson.  Patrick Bergin oozes menace as Miller's extremist superior, and Thora Birch is charming as Sally Ryan, Jack's daughter. The screenplay by W. Peter Iliff and Donald Stewart is crisp and taut, and director Philip Noyce keeps things moving along at a brisk pace.  And, to give Mace Neufeld credit, the casting of James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer (a role he played in Hunt for Red October) did give this film some sense of continuity.As a long-time Clancy reader, though, I must say that I agree with the reviewer who said the novel's ending would have been better.  Maybe less Hollywood-y, especially because it would have required Jack Ryan not to kill Sean Miller (in the novels, Miller goes to trial, is found guilty, and by the time of The Sum of All Fears he is finally executed).  But what works in the literary medium doesn't always work on the silver screen, so a more exciting and definite climax was chosen instead.",4,Ford and Noyce Make,1056844800,"06 29, 2003",2003,3535,"['Patriot', 'Games', 'second', 'film', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'series', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'central', 'character', 'tale', 'heroism', 'vengeance', 'set', 'backdrop', 'Irish', 'troubles', 'other', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'core', 'book', 'plot', 'same', 'time', 'tweaking', 'make', 'movie', 'fit', 'certain', 'amount', 'running', 'time', 'pump', 'up', 'action', 'attract', 'large', 'audiences', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'familiar', 'novel.Patriot', 'Games', 'fiddles', 'established', 'chronology', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'novels', 'moving', 'timeline', 'forward', 'rather', 'backward', 'universe', 'depicted', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'place', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'novel', 'were', 'several', 'offhand', 'references', 'as-yet', 'unfinished', 'unpublished', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'one', 'character', 'refers', 'Jack', 'Sir', 'John', 'early', 'later', 'someone', 'high-profile', 'incident', 'involving', 'Ryan', 'terrorists', 'London', 'Had', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'signed', 'do', 'film', 'maybe', 'Games-as-prequel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'when', 'Ford', 'accepted', 'role', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Ryan', 'age', 'precluded', 'notion.As', 'novel', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'London', 'working', 'vacation', 'wife', 'Cathy', 'Ann', 'Archer', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'way', 'join', 'family', 'sightseeing', 'walk', 'Ryan', 'literally', 'Irish', 'armed', 'group', 'ambush', 'Lord', 'Howe', 'James', 'Fox', 'wife', 'are', 'driving', 'London', 'street', 'hesitating', 'Ryan', 'back', 'Marine/CIA', 'training', 'attack', 'killing', 'two', 'attackers', 'one', 'whom', 'uber-terrorist', 'Sean', 'Miller', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'younger', 'brother', 'too', 'wounded', 'Ryan', 'court', 'Miller', 'sets', 'off', 'chain', 'vendetta-upon-vendetta', 'will', 'lead', 'Ryan', 'return', 'CIA', 'Moby', 'Dick-like', 'obsessive', 'quest', 'revenge', 'Miller', 'part.Viewed', 'purely', 'merits', 'movie', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'well', 'Ford', 'Ryan', 'role', 'effortlessly', 'ironic', 'had', 'turned', 'down', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'citing', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'action', 'movie', 'where', 'character', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'interaction', 'family', 'thus', 'earning', 'reputation', 'thinking', 'man', 'action', 'hero', 'scenes', 'lovely', 'Ann', 'Archer', 'are', 'totally', 'believable', 'character', 'motivations', 'Not', 'honor', 'Not', 'country', 'wife', 'child', 'audience', 'more', 'human', 'vulnerable', 'hero', 'root', 'Ryan', 'antithesis', 'James', 'Bond', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'here', 'early', 'career', 'Ryan', 'best', 'friend', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'Robby', 'Jackson', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'menace', 'Miller', 'extremist', 'superior', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'charming', 'Sally', 'Ryan', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'screenplay', 'W.', 'Peter', 'Iliff', 'Donald', 'Stewart', 'crisp', 'taut', 'director', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'things', 'moving', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'give', 'Mace', 'Neufeld', 'credit', 'casting', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Admiral', 'James', 'Greer', 'role', 'played', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'did', 'give', 'film', 'sense', 'continuity.As', 'long-time', 'Clancy', 'reader', 'must', 'say', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'novel', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Maybe', 'less', 'Hollywood-y', 'especially', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'not', 'kill', 'Sean', 'Miller', 'novels', 'Miller', 'trial', 'found', 'guilty', 'time', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'finally', 'executed', 'what', 'literary', 'medium', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'silver', 'screen', 'more', 'exciting', 'definite', 'climax', 'was', 'chosen', 'instead']",N/A

Nothing leading up to it felt truly suspenseful but more like a collection of scenes that were supposed to build intensity but managed to do nothing of the sort.  When it was all over I didn't care much about it.  Aside from that pretty big snafu, there isn't really much to complain about.  It is competently made and technically fine.  The music is perfectly suited to the genre, the acting is decent enough (Ford is Ford and this is yet another role he can snarl through), but the story is just so `not there'.  It just felt so unimportant and empty.  The thrills are barely registered and the characters are somewhat boring.

Patriot Games is one helluva an action movie!Harrison Fordburns with intensity playing Jack Ryan as an everyman with a deadly right hook and a staunch moral compass...that is *still* the best incarnation of Ryan onscreen. His bar threat to Richard Harris' snaky IRA representative shows an intensity and coldness that Ford rarely shows.Sean Beanis fiery and unpredictable as vengeance-bent Sean Miller, out for revenge on Jack Ryan with a submachine gun, chiselled cheekbones, and an Ulster accent. Sean Bean is *this* close to being typecast as a villain, he manages to be sympathetic AND menacing - in one of his best roles.Patrick Berginis one icy cool customer as he steals the scenes as calculating, psychotic terrorist Kevin O'Donnell. Bergin gives an electrifying performance: violent, menacing, and played with a devilishly cold glint in the eyes.I was almost ashamed to say that I was proud to be an Irishman as I watched this movie!The rest of the cast, especially Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Harris, play their roles with aplomb. Technically, the film gets top marks. The score by James Horner is up to the maestro's usual top standards. The editing is excellent and the cinematography is quite often stunning.Phillip Noyce directs with style and a relevancy that was ahead of it's time. Patriot Games is often surprisingly effective, even if some of the outdated tech is often painful to watch. The action scenes are excellent and riveting, with the Irishmen stealing the scenes, or rather, shooting them full of holes with an M16. This was back in the day when they actually bothered to BLOW UP an actual car for a film, rather than CGI a huge fireball on it...*stares wistfully*Jack Ryan may not be as suave and impeccable chiselled as Bond; he may not know how to kill someone with a hand towel like Jason Bourne...but he has a moral compass, a strong jaw, a stronger right hook, and a sense of decency that, when it is frayed by evil men, can turn into fiery heat in a second. Combined with Tom Clancy's techno-centric, improbable but entertaining plots, Patriot Games is an above average spy thriller.My rating? 4.5 stars out of 5.P.S. Rest in peace, Tom Clancy. You wrote books so big they could be used as house bricks in an emergency. Your plots were so complex they needed alternate universes to make sense. Your Jack Ryan is one of America's favorite characters, because he represents the truth, justice, and American way that they strive for. You named one of your books ""Red Rabbit"", which was brave, to say the least...You died too soon, so once again I say, rest in peace.

The plot involves one of the most obsessed bad guys you'll ever see, a fanatically militant member of an IRA splinter group whose attack on the British royal family is thwarted almost unconsciously by Ryan, who is visiting England as a tourist/lecturer.  Now ex-CIA, Ryan's family is nearby, and family is central in this tale of the cold-blooded world of international espionage and terrorism.  The family angle is one that keeps the story so chilling throughout, as the terrorist's brother is shot to death by Ryan as he ruins their try on the royals, and our star villain then sets out to stalk Ryan and his wife and daughter.The film moves at an almost perfect pace, and unveils to us some modern aspects of this shadowy world.  For instance, even Ryan, played with understated perfection by Harrison Ford, is creeped out by his participation in a nighttime strike on a desert camp believed to be IRA training ground.  In this scene he and several other jacket-and-tie types watch soldiers take out this nest of vipers a half-world away, thanks to infrared and satellite technology, all while detached voices calmly note &quot;Target neutralized&quot; and spies dressed like businessmen smile and nod while whispering to one another in thorough detachment from the blood and guts of the operation.  All this technology and we are not removed from the days of the rich people perching on hills near the battles of Civil War days, sipping tea while viewing the entertainment.I cannot give less than five stars to a film that draws me in so completely as this one, making me feel the tension with such clarity and indeed making it so easy to actually hate the villain.  Yet the film strikes sour notes with the drunken Richard Harris's half-hearted performance as an IRA bigwig, and with the cliched ending moment of an otherwise superb boat chase at the film's climax.

125121,AM1VFW804J5FL,079212569X,"""bulldog51""","[4, 8]","My biggest problem with this Hollywood adaptation of a Clancy novel is  that they cut out the most interesting character in the whole dog-gone  story, Gunnery Sgt. Breckenridge of the Naval Academy Security Detachment.  It is the Gunny whom the book's Jack Ryan turns to when he first feels the  need to sharpen his weapons skills to defend his family from the threat of  the terrorists. He's easily the most interesting good guy in the book, and  I STILL can't believe they completely cut him out for the movie!The only  thing that saves this movie from my further wrath is the performance of  Sean Bean.  He's one of my favorite actors (see the Sharpe series if you  want to see what is, in my opinion, his best work.)  Bean is suitably  cold-blooded and focused as the terrosit intent on avenging his brother,  who was killed by Ryan.As for those who are whining about how it  portrays the IRA, guess what, folks?  They DO blow up women and kids, they  DO shoot people (even some Catholics who don't agree with them) in the  kneecaps, and they WON'T turn in their guns and explosives.  Those are just  facts.

Ryan (Harrison Ford) has moved back to the USA, left the CIA, and joined the teaching staff at Annapolis.  He's in London with his wife Caroline (Anne Archer) and 10-year-old daughter Sally (Thora Birch) to deliver a lecture at the Royal Naval College when he walks unwittingly into an attempt by Irish terrorists Kevin O'Donnell (Patrick Bergin) and Sean Miller (Sean Bean) to assassinate a kinsman of the Queen and, as he later explains, ""can't just stand by and let him kill those people.""  His intervention results in the death of Miller's kid brother Paddy (Karl Hayden) and Miller's own arrest, and the man vows revenge.  What Ryan doesn't realize is that Miller and O'Donnell are part of a radical splinter group of the IRA: though most brigade commanders of the organization believe that nothing will turn the people against them faster than striking at the beloved ""royals,"" O'Donnell insists that ""England at its heart is still a monarchy, and that is where we must strike--at the royal family and the ruling class.""  When Miller's cohorts help him escape and flee the country, Ryan begins to wonder if the man will actually attempt his promised vengeance.  His old friend Adm. Greer (James Earl Jones) doesn't believe it, but an attempted hit on Jack's wife and daughter changes the face of things and sends Jack back to the CIA in a desperate attempt to track down the renegades before they can try again.  A wonderfully tense climax is played out at Jack's home on Chesapeake Bay against the background of a building storm, as Miller and O'Donnell attempt not only to finish their business with the Ryans but to make a second and successful try to kill their original victim (James Fox).It takes some doing to translate one of Tom Clancy's complex technothrillers to the screen with accuracy, yet scriptwriters Iliff & Stewart and director Simon Wincer manage it without either leaving holes in continuity or neglecting the larger political picture of separatist sentiment and intra-organizational feuding against which Ryan's involvement takes place.  The high-tech night raid on the Libyan camp where Miller & Co. are training is one of the movie's high points, but of course the best part is the long climactic sequence at the Ryans' home.  And Harrison Ford, with his blend of insouciance and ferocity, seems somehow much more convincing than Alec Baldwin might have been in the same situation--a family man who gets involved not out of any particular convictions but, as he says, ""just rage,"" and so becomes an important catalyst in affairs much larger than he realizes.  Though it's rated R and does include considerable violence, several uses of the F-word, and one not-too-graphic sex scene, I didn't find any of it gratuitous or offensive, and families with mature youngsters should be able to view it without any major difficulty.",4,For his family's sake,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,3027,"['not', 'relentlessly', 'suspenseful', 'asThe', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'second', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'still', 'plenty', 'action', 'suspense', 'offer', 'Ryan', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'moved', 'back', 'USA', 'left', 'CIA', 'joined', 'teaching', 'staff', 'Annapolis', 'London', 'wife', 'Caroline', 'Anne', 'Archer', '10-year-old', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'deliver', 'lecture', 'Royal', 'Naval', 'College', 'when', 'unwittingly', 'attempt', 'Irish', 'terrorists', 'Kevin', ""O'Donnell"", 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'Sean', 'Miller', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'assassinate', 'kinsman', 'Queen', 'later', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'stand', 'let', 'kill', 'people', 'intervention', 'results', 'death', 'Miller', 'kid', 'brother', 'Paddy', 'Karl', 'Hayden', 'Miller', 'own', 'arrest', 'man', 'revenge', 'What', 'Ryan', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Miller', ""O'Donnell"", 'are', 'part', 'radical', 'splinter', 'group', 'IRA', 'most', 'brigade', 'commanders', 'organization', 'believe', 'nothing', 'will', 'turn', 'people', 'faster', 'striking', 'beloved', 'royals', ""O'Donnell"", 'England', 'heart', 'still', 'monarchy', 'where', 'must', 'strike', 'royal', 'family', 'ruling', 'class', 'When', 'Miller', 'cohorts', 'help', 'escape', 'flee', 'country', 'Ryan', 'wonder', 'man', 'will', 'actually', 'attempt', 'promised', 'vengeance', 'old', 'friend', 'Adm.', 'Greer', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', ""n't"", 'believe', 'attempted', 'hit', 'Jack', 'wife', 'daughter', 'changes', 'face', 'things', 'Jack', 'back', 'CIA', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'track', 'down', 'renegades', 'can', 'try', 'again', 'A', 'wonderfully', 'tense', 'climax', 'played', 'out', 'Jack', 'home', 'Chesapeake', 'Bay', 'background', 'building', 'storm', 'Miller', ""O'Donnell"", 'attempt', 'not', 'only', 'finish', 'business', 'Ryans', 'make', 'second', 'successful', 'try', 'kill', 'original', 'victim', 'James', 'Fox', '.It', 'doing', 'translate', 'one', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'complex', 'technothrillers', 'screen', 'accuracy', 'scriptwriters', 'Iliff', 'Stewart', 'director', 'Simon', 'Wincer', 'manage', 'leaving', 'holes', 'continuity', 'neglecting', 'larger', 'political', 'picture', 'separatist', 'sentiment', 'intra-organizational', 'feuding', 'Ryan', 'involvement', 'place', 'high-tech', 'night', 'raid', 'Libyan', 'camp', 'where', 'Miller', 'Co.', 'are', 'training', 'one', 'movie', 'high', 'points', 'course', 'best', 'part', 'long', 'climactic', 'sequence', 'Ryans', 'home', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'blend', 'insouciance', 'ferocity', 'somehow', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'situation', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'involved', 'not', 'particular', 'convictions', 'just', 'rage', 'so', 'important', 'catalyst', 'affairs', 'much', 'larger', 'rated', 'R', 'include', 'considerable', 'violence', 'several', 'uses', 'F-word', 'one', 'not-too-graphic', 'sex', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'gratuitous', 'offensive', 'families', 'mature', 'youngsters', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'major', 'difficulty']",N/A

Basically, it belongs to the genre of Macho Male Revenge Fantasies and, as such, is several hundred yards below all but the silliest of the James Bond Thrillers and about 57 miles below ROGUE MALE (both the book by Geoffrey Household and the film version starring Peter O'Toole).On the Plus Side: (1) we have here a beautiful Enya soundtrack and (2) we see Han Solo (Harrison Ford) having a congenial reunion with the Voice of Darth Vader (J. E. Jones), which is an interesting coincidence of casting. Mildly amusing is the fact that Han Solo gets to tussle with Boromir-To-Be (Sean Bean of THE LORD OF THE RINGS).I'm giving PATRIOT GAMES 2 stars (or a D+) for being a VERY unbelievable Male Revenge Fantasy, for being unfair to the IRA v. Brit situation, and for having one of the hokeyest and most unintentionally funny battle-to-the-death endings I have seen in years--involving a speedboat chase--with the pointy points of an anchor (^ ^) highlighted again&again;&again; to foreshadow what MIGHT happen to end the life of somebody. Even months after seeing this, I sometimes find that the memory of it makes me shake my head in disbelieving wonder--and sometimes makes my whole body shake with laughter.Actually, as I've suggested, the best part o' PATRIOT GAMES is its lovely Enya soundtrack--an additional ""link"" to the LOTR films, which are FAR superior to this movie in every respect. For the sake o' fun, though, I like to think that Sean Bean's role here--as an IRA tough guy who gets sidetracked from his mission by a crazy, self-destructive obsession--was a long (but ultimately successful) screen-test for his role in LORD OF THE RINGS, playing another tough guy getting sidetracked from his proper mission by a self-destructive obsession.",2,"A GIANT SCREEN-TEST FOR SEAN BEAN TO BE BOROMIR IN ""LOTR""?",1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,1820,"['PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'very', 'weak', 'follow-up', 'THE', 'HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'Basically', 'genre', 'Macho', 'Male', 'Revenge', 'Fantasies', 'such', 'several', 'hundred', 'yards', 'silliest', 'James', 'Bond', 'Thrillers', '57', 'miles', 'ROGUE', 'MALE', 'book', 'Geoffrey', 'Household', 'film', 'version', 'starring', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", '.On', 'Plus', 'Side', '1', 'have', 'here', 'beautiful', 'Enya', 'soundtrack', '2', 'see', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'having', 'congenial', 'reunion', 'Voice', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'J.', 'E.', 'Jones', 'interesting', 'coincidence', 'casting', 'Mildly', 'amusing', 'fact', 'Han', 'Solo', 'tussle', 'Boromir-To-Be', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'THE', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', '.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', '2', 'stars', 'D+', 'being', 'VERY', 'unbelievable', 'Male', 'Revenge', 'Fantasy', 'being', 'unfair', 'IRA', 'v.', 'Brit', 'situation', 'having', 'one', 'hokeyest', 'most', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'battle-to-the-death', 'endings', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'involving', 'speedboat', 'chase', 'pointy', 'points', 'anchor', '^', '^', 'highlighted', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'foreshadow', 'what', 'MIGHT', 'happen', 'end', 'life', 'somebody', 'Even', 'months', 'seeing', 'sometimes', 'find', 'memory', 'shake', 'head', 'disbelieving', 'wonder', 'sometimes', 'whole', 'body', 'shake', 'laughter.Actually', ""'ve"", 'suggested', 'best', 'part', 'o', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'lovely', 'Enya', 'soundtrack', 'additional', 'link', 'LOTR', 'films', 'are', 'FAR', 'superior', 'movie', 'respect', 'sake', 'o', 'fun', 'like', 'think', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'role', 'here', 'IRA', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'sidetracked', 'mission', 'crazy', 'self-destructive', 'obsession', 'was', 'long', 'ultimately', 'successful', 'screen-test', 'role', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'playing', 'tough', 'guy', 'getting', 'sidetracked', 'proper', 'mission', 'self-destructive', 'obsession']",N/A

The Ryans go back to Washington after their holiday and Ryan himself resumes work at the CIA.

125142,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,079212569X,Erik North,"[2, 4]","Harrison Ford began cementing his reputation as a thinking man's action film actor by taking over the role of Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan from Alec Baldwin in PATRIOT GAMES, a solid 1992 follow-up to the 1990 blockbuster THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.  Under the taut direction of Australian-born Philip Noyce, PATRIOT GAMES succeeds as a solid technological thriller and a revenge play, in large part because of Ford's Everyman appearance.Ford, his wife (Anne Archer) and daughter (Thora Birch) are about ready to wrap up their vacation in London when they come upon a terrorist attack against Lord Holmes (James Fox), a member of the Royal Family, by a more radical splinter group of the Irish Republican Army.  Ford single-handedly foils the plot by killing one of the terrorists.  But now that terrorist's brother (Sean Bean) and his surviving comrades (Patrick Bergin, Polly Walker) have plans for Ford and his family on the other side of the Atlantic.When Bean and an associate attempt to kill Archer and Birch on a Maryland highway, an attempt that almost works, Ford, who had been retired from the CIA, suddenly steps back into the agency fray in order to find, trap, and kill Bean.  The end result is a chilling nighttime siege on Ford's isolated Maryland shore home during a storm.Though more violent than RED OCTOBER, PATRIOT GAMES at no time disintegrates into a typical action film bloodbath.  It is held together by Ford's brilliant acting, Archer's fine role as his wife, and the return of James Earl Jones as Ford's boss and mentor.  The late, great Richard Harris also does well in his brief cameo role as the IRA's chief American bagman Paddy O'Neill.  The brilliant score by James Horner utilizes elements of Irish folk music throughout.Like RED OCTOBER, and the next Jack Ryan film CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, PATRIOT GAMES is intelligent action film-making, the way it should be.",5,Taking On IRA Terrorists,1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,1900,"['Harrison', 'Ford', 'began', 'cementing', 'reputation', 'thinking', 'man', 'action', 'film', 'actor', 'taking', 'over', 'role', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'solid', '1992', 'follow-up', '1990', 'blockbuster', 'THE', 'HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'taut', 'direction', 'Australian-born', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'solid', 'technological', 'thriller', 'revenge', 'play', 'large', 'part', 'Ford', 'Everyman', 'appearance.Ford', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'daughter', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'are', 'ready', 'wrap', 'up', 'vacation', 'London', 'when', 'come', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Lord', 'Holmes', 'James', 'Fox', 'member', 'Royal', 'Family', 'more', 'radical', 'splinter', 'group', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', 'Ford', 'single-handedly', 'plot', 'killing', 'one', 'terrorists', 'now', 'terrorist', 'brother', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'surviving', 'comrades', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'have', 'plans', 'Ford', 'family', 'other', 'side', 'Atlantic.When', 'Bean', 'associate', 'attempt', 'kill', 'Archer', 'Birch', 'Maryland', 'highway', 'attempt', 'almost', 'Ford', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'retired', 'CIA', 'suddenly', 'back', 'agency', 'fray', 'order', 'find', 'trap', 'kill', 'Bean', 'end', 'result', 'chilling', 'nighttime', 'siege', 'Ford', 'isolated', 'Maryland', 'shore', 'home', 'storm.Though', 'more', 'violent', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'time', 'typical', 'action', 'film', 'bloodbath', 'held', 'together', 'Ford', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Archer', 'fine', 'role', 'wife', 'return', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Ford', 'boss', 'mentor', 'late', 'great', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'also', 'well', 'brief', 'cameo', 'role', 'IRA', 'chief', 'American', 'bagman', 'Paddy', ""O'Neill"", 'brilliant', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'utilizes', 'elements', 'Irish', 'folk', 'music', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'next', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'film', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'intelligent', 'action', 'film-making', 'way', 'should', 'be']",N/A

125154,A34FSS6DNL1UJ,079212569X,"""iriley1979""","[0, 6]","This movie has been critized for its portrayl of the IRA. I would have to say that it portrays the IRA fairly. The villians in this movie are not really the IRA, they are a ultra violent splinter group similiar to the type of organization that calls itself the ""Real IRA"", except that the splinter cell of Irish terrorists in this movie are even more violent than the ""Real IRA"" is in real life. The first time I watched this movie I was offended at how the Irish were treated but on viewing it again I realize that they were not treated unfairly. It is made clear in the film that most IRA members do not approve of the actions of the splinter cell or support them. In fact the splinter cell agents are at war with the ""regular"" IRA. The IRA and the splinter IRA terrorists are realistically portrayed. What is silly and unrealistic about this movie is the way the CIA and the British Intelligence services are portrayed. It is true that the IRA are not good guys, but neither are the CIA, or especially the SAS. The truth is that in real life the kind of people who are members of these types of organizations, (IRA, CIA, SAS, etc.) are all heartless killers. They have to be, that is their job. So I do not think that the way the IRA was portrayed was so different from reality but the way the CIA and the SAS was portayed borders on the cartoonish. The CIA and the SAS have both committed numerous atrocities as have the IRA. This movie should have demonstrated that the CIA is dirty. For instance see Clear and Present Danger by Clancy, that movie shows how the CIA really works. As for the British history of opression in Ireland, it is unspeakable and everyone knows it even if they do not admit it. That does not execuse some of the things the IRA has done but British atrocities should be taken into account. Anyway, on to the movie it is well done and fast paced, well directed, well acted, well written. Sean Bean is great as a the IRA terrorist. Harrison Ford is good as Jack Ryan. The music is also good. The action scenes are realistic but not violent enough, real shooting and death are much more gory. This movie was rated R, so why not run with it? The best scene in the movie was the hit on Ryan's family on the highway, the whole sequence was suspense packed. The terrorists getting stopped by the child serving as a crossing guard was a great touch. They were about to kill Ryan's wife and child when that little kid just stands in front of them with that stop sign. Even these hardened terrorists could not bring themselves to run over a bunch of innocent kids who had nothing to do with Ryan. After ""Shawn Millar"" shoots up Ryan's wife's car on the highway and it goes crashing into a divider and he says ""They're gone"" about as matter of factly as possible, really reveials what a cold blooded evil person he is. He is a great villian.

Ford has that everyman quality that works really well when he finds himself and his family (wife Anne Archer and daughter Thora Birch) thrust into international events when they witness an assassination attempt on a British royal.  Ford thwarts the attempt, which makes his family revenge targets.  The assassins, an Irish militant group, counts amongst its members, a hotheaded Sean Bean who makes it his mission to kill Ford, Archer, and Birch.  But needless to say, Ford has other ideas!Patriot Games is a well-crafted thriller from director Philip Noyce.  He keeps the tension going from the beginning, mixing periodic bits of action into the drama that drive the film to its' climax.  There's also a good mix of gadgetry and politics to spice the plot up as well.Ford does a great job portraying the hero as a family man out to protect his loved ones.  Archer is an ideal, classy wife, and Birch isn't the typically annoying or cute movie kid ... she's very likeable.  Samuel L. Jackson is wasted in a smaller role as Ford's buddy, while Bean and Patrick Bergin make the most of their bad guy roles.I've seen a lot of action films that have the heart stopping chases and intrigue, but Patriot Games is a step above them.

He is a professor at the United States Naval Academy and his knowledge is greatly appreciated. He is with his family in London. Irish terrorists attack the British Secretary of State and Ryan, a former Marine officer, uses his combat experience and saves the Secretary and kills one of the terrorist while he is wounded himself. He is knighted for his bravery by the Queen for saving the Secretary who was her cousin.The leader of the terrorists has Ryan on his list of people to kill as Ryan killed his younger brother and also testified against him in British court. The head terrorist, Sean Miler (Sean Bean), escapes from his convoy to prison and plans a mission to get revenge on Ryan and his family at the same time. And that is just the start of Ryan's problems with Sean Miller....This is an excellent story and it is based on a book by Tom Clancy of the same title. I love Tom Clancy's books and this was an excellent story and a great movie. The cast of the film is very good and contains many strong actors who portray their roles to perfection.

125167,AP6K3SR8E9EY8,079212569X,"""jpmb""","[5, 8]","""Patriot Games"" is my favorite of Tom Clancy's novel, a taut thriller in which the hero is caught in a moral dilemma. He wants to protect his family, but worries that at some point he might become just as bad as the terrorists he is fighting. There is action, and there is a soul.How upsetting, then, to find the movie has thrown all that away  and turned it into a shoot 'em 'up. Somehow they managed to keep all the events more or less intact and still sacrificed everything that made the book so satisfying. Even Jack Ryan's wife joins in, urging him, ""Get 'em, Jack."" What a travesty!In place of the nuanced moral quandary of the novel, we've been given something with no more soul than one of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. It apparently doesn't matter what kind of people we are, only who's fastest with a gun.Harrison Ford is OK as Jack Ryan, although even here he's getting a little long in the tooth for the part, and this is supposedly the first of the stories, the events that took place before ""Red October."" Frankly, I liked Alec Baldwin better as Ryan, although I'm apparently the only person in the universe who did.It is absurd, I know, to complain that a movie ""wasn't like the book.""

125168,A25RN8X70DSZLU,079212569X,JRP,"[3, 4]","Now it's time for me to review a movie that came out either in 2002 or 1992. This is 20 years ago Patriot Games. I've always enjoyed this movie more than The Hunt For Red October. Patriot Games was directed by Phillip Noyce he directed the sequel to this movie Clear & Present Danger & he also directed The Bone Collector. It stars Harrison Ford this time as Jack Ryan, Sean Bean as Sean Miller, Anne Archer as Cathy Ryan, Thora Birch as Sally Ryan, Samuel L Jackson as Lietenant Commander Robby Jackson, & James Eral Jones as Admiral James Greer. The story is Jack Ryan stopped these terrorists with The IRA they put a bomb on this British Secretary's car Jack kills 1 of the terrorists & Jack has also been shot. The rest of the group escapes where they leave 2 of their IRA buddies behind. It turns out the 2 that were left behind are brothers the younger bother was killed. Jack & his family return to the states. Meanwhile you have a group that has broken off of The IRA free Sean Miller when he was being transported. Miller goes with this group to The US he wants revenge for his brother being killed. Jack Ryan has retired from The CIA he works as a teacher at a Naval Academy. Vice Admiral James Greer has warned Jack about Sean Miller escaping. Sean Miller follows Jack's Wife Cathy when she is picking up their Daughter Sally. When Jack is leaving the academy to go home he notices a suspicious man so he gets a little paranoid he takes that guy down he gets out of their & he calls his wife & tells her to meet him at The Police Station. You have this group chasing after him Miller opens fire on the car that Cathy & Sally are in which cause her to wreck the car bad. Their in the hospital & the scene where Jack sees his Daughter on on the hospital bed in a coma & cries Harrison Ford sells it. It's not goofy like when Tobey McGuire cries or anything like that. So Jack goes back to The CIA. To go after Sean Miller who has fled to Libya where the group plots their next attack. They found out where the camp is at & a Special Air Service goes in there where they think they killed all of the terrorists. But Miller & the group he is with are already coming to The US. Sally has been released from the hospital where they have a coming home party for her. The Cops & The Diplomatic Security Agents are killed by Miller & his group they are going after The British Secretary cause he's there. 1 of The British Secretaries aid's goes to the basement & cuts the power. Jack knows that it is Sean Miller when he looks outside & he sees that the boat house still has power Cathy gets Sally upstairs Jack & LT Robby Jackson run into that aid coming up from the basement Jack beats that guy up he tells him that there 6 people in the group. There happens to be 1 of them upstairs where Cathy takes a shotgun & knocks 1 of them out. Jack finishes the job. In the basement Robby kills 2 of the terrorists cause that British Secretary turns the power back on blinding their night vison equipment. Jack has Robby get his family to safety. Outside he takes 1 of their motor boats where they follow him but when that leader guy of the group sees that The Secretary isn't on the boat he wants Miller to stop chasing after him. Miller kills him & the lady that guy was with. Miller shoots at the boat & causes a fire on the boat that Jack is on he jumps on board where they have a fight. Miller attacks him with this big axe blade looking thing but it gets stuck when he misses Jack. Then Jack impales Miller on those blades he jumps off the boat & when it lands on shore you have nice explosion killing Sean Miller & that's pretty movie. I'm sorry if I didn't do a good job explaining the plot. Phillip Noyce did a good job directing. Harrison Ford was great. Sean Bean did a really good job.

These three bold statements are emblazoned on the cover of the DVD which, quite briefly, sums up the theme behind this fairly decent adaptation of Tom Clancy's best selling novel of the same name.  While, as with all of the ""Clancy"" movies, the screenplay, written by W. Peter Iliff is very loosely based on the actual novel, this film is excellent as a stand alone.  A minor note about the screenplay, they should've stuck with the original ending from the book, it would've been much more dramatic.  This film certainly stuck a little closer to the original novel than the summer 2002 adaptation of ""The Sum of All Fears.""Replacing ""The Hunt for Red October's"" Alec Baldwin and Gates McFadden (best known as Dr. Beverly Crusher from Star Trek The Next Generation) as Jack and Cathy Ryan are Harrison Ford and the ever beautiful Anne Archer.  The films producers couldn't have made a better choice to fill these two integral roles.  Reprising the role of Admiral James Greer, James Earl Jones gives another fine performance.  The recently departed Richard Harris of Harry Potter fame performs admirably as well.  Samuel L. Jackson does well with the role of Commander Robbie Jackson, fellow professor and best friend to Jack Ryan.  Performing admirably in the primary antagonist's role is Sean Bean of Lord of the Rings fame.  Outstanding performances by all mentioned.The score, performed by James Horner, is quite in keeping with his usual high standards.  It meshes beautifully with every scene.  The DVD itself is not much to speak of, in that the only feature on it is one theatrical trailer.  Ultimately this is fine though, as I rate/review movies based on the movie itself, not all of the extraneous other items...Dr. John Patrick Ryan and his family are on a working vacation in London, England.  As he and his family meet up in a park, what appears to be IRA terrorists, blow up a car and are attempting to kidnap members of the Royal family.  Throwing caution to the wind, Jack Ryan jumps into the fray...What follows is an extremely intriguing and well made movie.  Many ""Clancy"" fans may not have found this film to be up to the standards of his novels.  This, in my opinion, is not the case, being that it is entirely impossible to film a five hundred plus page novel into two hours. This is not the ""Patriot Games"" that I've read a couple times now, but it is very good as it stands on its own merits.I highly recommend this film to all those who are interested in a good, suspense filled and action packed thriller.  {ssintrepid}",5,Patriot Games - A fine adaptation of Clancy&#65533;s masterpiece!,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,2605,"['Not', 'honor', 'Not', 'country', 'wife', 'child', 'three', 'bold', 'statements', 'are', 'emblazoned', 'cover', 'DVD', 'quite', 'briefly', 'sums', 'up', 'theme', 'fairly', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Clancy', 'movies', 'screenplay', 'written', 'W.', 'Peter', 'Iliff', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'actual', 'novel', 'film', 'excellent', 'stand', 'alone', 'minor', 'note', 'screenplay', 'should', ""'ve"", 'stuck', 'original', 'ending', 'book', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'film', 'certainly', 'stuck', 'little', 'closer', 'original', 'novel', 'summer', '2002', 'adaptation', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'Replacing', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Gates', 'McFadden', 'best', 'known', 'Dr.', 'Beverly', 'Crusher', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Jack', 'Cathy', 'Ryan', 'are', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'films', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'better', 'choice', 'fill', 'two', 'integral', 'roles', 'Reprising', 'role', 'Admiral', 'James', 'Greer', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'fine', 'performance', 'recently', 'departed', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'admirably', 'as', 'well', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'well', 'role', 'Commander', 'Robbie', 'Jackson', 'fellow', 'professor', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Performing', 'admirably', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'role', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'fame', 'Outstanding', 'performances', 'mentioned.The', 'score', 'performed', 'James', 'Horner', 'quite', 'keeping', 'usual', 'high', 'standards', 'beautifully', 'scene', 'DVD', 'not', 'much', 'speak', 'only', 'feature', 'one', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Ultimately', 'fine', 'though', 'rate/review', 'movies', 'based', 'movie', 'not', 'extraneous', 'other', 'items', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Ryan', 'family', 'are', 'working', 'vacation', 'London', 'England', 'family', 'meet', 'up', 'park', 'what', 'be', 'IRA', 'terrorists', 'blow', 'up', 'car', 'are', 'attempting', 'kidnap', 'members', 'Royal', 'family', 'Throwing', 'caution', 'wind', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'fray', 'What', 'extremely', 'intriguing', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'Many', 'Clancy', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'up', 'standards', 'novels', 'opinion', 'not', 'case', 'being', 'entirely', 'impossible', 'film', 'five', 'hundred', 'page', 'novel', 'two', 'hours', 'not', 'Patriot', 'Games', ""'ve"", 'read', 'couple', 'times', 'now', 'very', 'good', 'own', 'merits.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'good', 'suspense', 'filled', 'action', 'packed', 'thriller', 'ssintrepid']",N/A

Patriot Games is one of them.The storyline is quite simple: Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford), former CIA analyst, is on vacation/lecture tour in England with his family. While on the way to meet them near Buckingham Palace, he & his family are caught in a cross-fire during an assassination attempt on a member of the Royal Family, Lord Holmes (Edward Fox), by a rogue faction of the IRA led by Sean Miller (Sean Bean). In the ensuing shoot-out, Jack killed one the terrorists, who happens to be Sean's younger brother. Jack gets drawn back into the CIA after the terrorists set out a vengeful attack against his family back in USA.In my view, the action sequences in this movie are not very exciting, when compared with any of the recent Bond &/or Bourne movies, although the entire movie is quite entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the sequence showing a real-time satellite-tracking session at CIA HQ, during which Jack & his counter-terrorism team are watching a crack SAS team conducting a black ops raid at the terrorists' hideout somewhere in Libya. The accompanying music score is realistically haunting!What excites me most about this movie is watching Jack exercising his astute power of observation & his uncanny ability to juxtapose images in a relentless attempt to track down the whereabout of the rogue faction of the IRA,...with the high-tech resources of CIA's counter-terrorism group, of course.Using vital information secured from Paddy O'Neil (Richard Harris), an IRA supporter in the USA, Jack narrows down the search through his observation/juxtaposition of CIA's satellite images (which includes an overhead snapshot of an apparently capped woman with a pony tail) with his own recalled images:- a back-view glimpse of the pony-tailed driver in the terrorists' getaway vehicle during the foiled assassination attempt in England;- a side-view glance of the pony-tailed driver in the terrorists' getaway vehicle during an unsuccessful assassination attempt on his life outside the US Naval Academy;All these associations have been triggered while taking a break & walking pass a pony-tailed woman employee on the way to answer the call of nature at CIA Headquarters.What a brilliant piece of detective work - observation plus juxtaposition - on the part of Jack!The Power of Observation & Juxtaposition are obviously  requisite character traits of a CIA analyst.In summing up this review, I have enjoyed very much watching Patriot Games, experientially as well as educationally.

Harrison Ford (Ryan) seems to be still feeling his way through the role  Alec Baldwin almost certainly regrets abandoning after 1990's &quot;Hunt  for Red October&quot;.

The plot, cartoony at best, has heavily dated and its a real pity to see such stellar talent as James Earl Jones, James Fox and Samuel L. Jackson, wasted in cardboard cut out characterizations.Transfer wise, we get a tired print master that is absent of the excess of shimmering, aliasing and edge enhancement that plagued the original DVD release of this movie.  Though all of these characteristics are still present on this disc they are not quite as obvious.Pixelization still is a problem, heavily presented in many of the exterior scenes, while colors are muddy, dull and undistinguished.  Black levels and contrast levels are both weak.  Fine detail is virtually non-existant in scenes taking place at night.  The picture quality has an over all soft characteristic, riddled with film grain, scratches, chips and imperfections registered in the original camera negative.  This is a dull and uninspiring presentation that Paramount ought to really be ashamed of, considering how much they had to live up to after their first disastrous transfer of this movie.The audio is presented in both 5.1 and DTS but the tracks are virtually alike, save some minor bass enhancement in the DTS version.  Voices are not presented with an ounce of natural ambiance, sounding, at times, duped (a common Hollywood practise that, done right, a listener should never notice).

For one thing, the quicker exposition of the plight of the family and how it isn't really overplayed or over-dramatized.  In theory, this film could almost be a little more realistic than the usual snazzy explosion-thriller.  Also it has one of those ""slam-bang"" endings that is actually pretty exciting.

The bad guys here are a splinter group of Irish terrorist who will stop at nothing to ...well, I'm not positive just what they're after.  Presumably it is getting the English out of Northern Ireland and I guess there may have been some talk about this goal.  However, these guys are so bad it would seem they would keep killing even if their stated goals were achieved.  This is especially true of the main culprit and it is he and his brother who falls victim when Harrison Ford rescues a member of the royal family from an attempted abduction.  The bad guy, played, I believe, by Sean Bean, is caught and sentenced to prison.  That would be the end of the movie except he escapes from prison and vows revenge on Ford.  How he tries to achieve that revenge is the crux of the movie.Along the way we get some insight to the CIA's efforts to combat terrorism as well as some less evil IRA types who DO view their mission as political and not personal.  However, the movie succeeds with a very well done showdown between the good guys and the bad guys.  That is a particularly well done suspenseful series of events that may have you jumping out of your seat a time or two.  It is a credit to Tom Clancy's book as well as to the director and script writer that this action is so powerfully done.I admit to some misgivings about the flow of the story.

After that, the plot stumbles and staggers through various disjointed episodes, some of which are visually stunning but few of which make much sense. For example, especially after the first attack on the World Trade Center and extensive violence in Northern Ireland in 1991, there is an almost total absence of appropriate security precautions throughout this film. How ludicrous, given the numerous and quite serious dangers in which Ryan and his family find themselves after Sean Miller's escape. Lord Holmes remains a high priority candidate for assassination whose safety is presumably of some interest to British and American authorities.  Nonetheless, near the end of the film when he (one of the most visible of ""The Royals"") visits the United States and joins the Ryans for dinner in their home, he and they are essentially defenseless to terrorists who months ago vowed to kill them. The events which follow are even less plausible.This film has a few effective moments but, on balance, is a disappointment. I would have preferred Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan and regret the waste of Anne Archer's talents. (Most of her time on screen as Dr. Cathy Ryan. she is either beaming with approval or wincing with apprehension.) The car chase and attempt on her life -- on a limited-access highway during rush hour! -- seem gratuitous, indeed strategically irrational, as does the earlier attempt on Ryan's life on a street in Annapolis. (Of course, he is alone and unprotected, thus vulnerable to everyone else on the same street as well as to passing cars. Dumb.) Surely more could be done with Ryan's friend and U.S. Naval Academy colleague Robby Freeman (Samuel L. Jackson). As for Richard Harris, he does the best he can with what is essentially a cartoon character, Paddy O'Neil. James Earl Jones reprises his role as Admiral James Greer, spending much of his time entering and leaving rooms. Whoever is responsible for such waste should be charged with criminal neglect.To sum up, this film is consistently pleasant to look at. However, the plot seldom makes sense and the overall quality of acting is mediocre. Nonetheless, it has been a cash cow for Paramount and its producers so apparently others have a much higher regard for it than I do.

Therefore, I will focus solely on the quality of the Blu Ray DVD as it is a movie I have owned and enjoyed on Standard Def.  I found it on sale at Walmart for $7.99 and thought I would buy it.I have read some critical comments on the quality of the transfer but, sorry, I don't agree.  The video transfer is very clean throughout without a speck of aliasing, stair stepping (which would have been very noticeable early on when there is a close up of a Rolls Royce's grill moving towards the camera) and only the very slightest hint of grain when I paused the disc towards the end of the movie when the family crisis is over and they are sitting on the couch.  The beige wall behind them, if paused will show some slight grain, but, then again, it is behind them and slightly out of focus as it was intended to be.  The colors of this transfer tend to be a touch soft and I suppose that may be considered a negative but sharp details can be seen in almost each clip and there is depth to the shadows.The Dolby Digital True HD audio is clean, clear and precise with balanced tones between foley fx and dialogue.  The audio is nicely spread across the front of the theater with excellent tracking from side to side where appropriate.  The rear channels are not used very much for discreet fx but are put into play primarily for atmospheric ambiance.  This is not to say that there isn't any panning from rear to front or visa versa, but it is not very often.Your sub will frequently come into play especially during any action sequences.  Keep in mind that if you hear your sub directly, it is set too loud as low bass is ,and should be, non directional.There is, other than the trailer, one extra on this disc, an interesting telling of how the movie was cast and the director chosen.  No deleted or extended scenes or out takes which I always enjoy.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Patriot Games on Blu Ray,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2356,"['Not', 'writing', 'book', 'reports', 'plot', 'summaries', 'making', 'judgements', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'buying', 'one', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Standard', 'Def', 'Therefore', 'will', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'movie', 'have', 'owned', 'enjoyed', 'Standard', 'Def', 'found', 'sale', 'Walmart', '7.99', 'thought', 'would', 'buy', 'it.I', 'have', 'read', 'critical', 'comments', 'quality', 'transfer', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'video', 'transfer', 'very', 'clean', 'speck', 'aliasing', 'stair', 'stepping', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'noticeable', 'early', 'when', 'close', 'Rolls', 'Royce', 'grill', 'moving', 'camera', 'only', 'very', 'slightest', 'hint', 'grain', 'when', 'paused', 'disc', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'family', 'crisis', 'are', 'sitting', 'couch', 'beige', 'wall', 'paused', 'will', 'show', 'slight', 'grain', 'then', 'again', 'slightly', 'focus', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'colors', 'transfer', 'tend', 'be', 'touch', 'soft', 'suppose', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'negative', 'sharp', 'details', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'almost', 'clip', 'depth', 'shadows.The', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'True', 'HD', 'audio', 'clean', 'clear', 'precise', 'balanced', 'tones', 'foley', 'fx', 'dialogue', 'audio', 'nicely', 'spread', 'front', 'theater', 'excellent', 'tracking', 'side', 'side', 'where', 'appropriate', 'rear', 'channels', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'very', 'much', 'discreet', 'fx', 'are', 'put', 'play', 'primarily', 'atmospheric', 'ambiance', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'panning', 'rear', 'front', 'visa', 'versa', 'not', 'very', 'often.Your', 'sub', 'will', 'frequently', 'come', 'play', 'especially', 'action', 'sequences', 'Keep', 'mind', 'hear', 'sub', 'directly', 'set', 'too', 'loud', 'low', 'bass', 'should', 'be', 'non', 'directional.There', 'other', 'trailer', 'one', 'extra', 'disc', 'interesting', 'telling', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'cast', 'director', 'chosen', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'out', 'always', 'enjoy.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

125219,A14NA0W8ESGDSI,079212569X,Timothy Lovett,"[1, 2]","Patriot Games is one of the best action adventure movies out there based off the book by Tom Clancy (one of the most entertaining writers for this genre).The movie starts as former CIA agent Jack Ryan intercepts a mission by a rogue group of IRA operatives while in London. As a result of the failed mission by the operatives Jack is given a reward and is thanked by the government. This is only the beginning, however, because during the operation one of the terrorist's brother was killed and he's out for revenge.I think what makes this story so engaging is the fact that it forces us to think about how we'd respond in the situation Jack himself is put into. With your family in danger who do you turn to? What do you do to protect them? Can you really protect them?Harrison Ford shines throughout the whole story and portrays a believable character filled with emotion and determination to do the right thing. It's an amazing movie and while it's not the sort of movie you'd watch twice in a row in the same sitting definitely is the sort you'd pull out every once in awhile to rewatch.

I've been trying to correct that by watching one of the Ford filmography that I haven't seen yet. That led me to watching PATRIOT GAMES. Before watching the film, I knew that the movie was based off of a Tom Clancy novel; starred Harrison Ford; and that it took place after THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.I really enjoyed watching the movie. It was filled with just enough suspense and fairly believable action to keep the film rolling along. The movie had a great cast (besides Ford, there's also James Earl Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Sean Bean, Thora Birch, etc.). The movie involves Jack Ryan (Ford) saving a member of the English elite while vacationing in London and in the process kills a member of the IRA. The brother of said IRA member becomes obsessed with getting even with Ryan and tries to have him and his family murdered.The film doesn't paint the IRA in a positive light at all and that in turn leads to some people thinking all Irish people are ""bad"". That's just not true. The Irish are great people and the IRA has done a few good things over the years. Nevertheless, the organization still has a reputation for being a terrorist group and unfortunately most of their good deeds have been overshadowed and outnumbered by the bad.Anyway, PATRIOT GAMES is a decent action adventure/suspense movie.
