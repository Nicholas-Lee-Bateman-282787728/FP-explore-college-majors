1318727,A2XZE1TB784HKX,B0032JTV6A,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[0, 0]",Well I have to say season 3 of True Blood was a bit of a let down compared to the previous 2 seasons. There were so many things that were good but did not live up to my expectations of the first two seasons. It seemed like this season was a build for season 4 because there was no real conclusion. Well there was but it wasn't like the first two seasons were they were trying to find a killer and trying to defeated an evil person. The one thing I didn't like was all of the super natural powers it made it seem a little corny to me. I understand it is part of this series but at the same time it didn't feel right. The wearwovles were an interesting add to the season but overall just seemed like they were an after thought. One addition that I did like to the season that really stood out was Sam discovered he had a younger brother named Tommy. Throughout the season Tommy ends up being more trouble then good but he is in a lot of important parts of the series and even plays an interesting part in the season coming up. There were some interesting twist and turns that kept you on the edge of your seat for next season I believe on the last episode. You really end up getting into the characters in this series and identify with some of them. I think my favorite character overall has been same although I have been a big Sookie and Eric fan. Overall this season of True blood was a bit down from last season but still gets a thumbs up from me and I am anticipating season 4 coming up. Overall 4/5 stars and my favorite TV series on TV by far in a long time maybe ever if you don't count WWE.,4,True Blood Season 3 is a mixed bag but it is still solid and hypes you up for what is to come in season 4,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,1597,"['Well', 'have', 'say', 'season', '3', 'True', 'Blood', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'compared', 'previous', '2', 'seasons', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'season', 'was', 'build', 'season', '4', 'was', 'real', 'conclusion', 'Well', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'were', 'trying', 'find', 'killer', 'trying', 'defeated', 'evil', 'person', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'super', 'natural', 'powers', 'made', 'seem', 'little', 'corny', 'understand', 'part', 'series', 'same', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'wearwovles', 'were', 'interesting', 'add', 'season', 'overall', 'just', 'seemed', 'were', 'thought', 'One', 'addition', 'did', 'like', 'season', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'Sam', 'discovered', 'had', 'younger', 'brother', 'named', 'Tommy', 'season', 'Tommy', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'trouble', 'then', 'good', 'lot', 'important', 'parts', 'series', 'even', 'interesting', 'part', 'season', 'coming', 'up', 'were', 'interesting', 'twist', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'next', 'season', 'believe', 'last', 'episode', 'really', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'characters', 'series', 'identify', 'think', 'favorite', 'character', 'overall', 'been', 'same', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'Sookie', 'Eric', 'fan', 'Overall', 'season', 'True', 'blood', 'was', 'bit', 'down', 'last', 'season', 'still', 'thumbs', 'up', 'am', 'anticipating', 'season', '4', 'coming', 'up', 'Overall', '4/5', 'stars', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'TV', 'far', 'long', 'time', 'maybe', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'WWE']",N/A

1318730,AKJONKU5DALMF,B0032JTV6A,"A.Marte ""Supernatural  Lover""","[11, 17]","I am still quite confused as to how a writer/director like Allan Ball is considered a genius, based off one pretty good film and a mediocre TV show. I was told to watch because ""how can it not be awesome, Allan Ball is doing it?"" and I hated it. Later I received both season 1 and 2 plus the 8-book box set of Mrs. Harris novels as a gift(everyone else seemed to love it so they thought I would as well), gave it another chance and read the books. I grew to appreciate the show for the ensemble of talented actors. The books are not well written but they have good plots; I do not understand why Allan has to change characters traits as well as plots to make this his own. With that being said, season 3 was by far the worst. At least with the Marianne storyline, all the characters and plots were cohesive. It might have dragged on considerably longer then some viewers would have liked but at least it made sense, sort of. This season and I will not give away plots, was like trying to catch watermelons with a bowl; I mostly felt empty-handed after each episode. I caught little nuances of the mirror being put up but mostly it was a jumbled, hurried mess. There were far too many plots and subplots to the point that nothing was truly explored or resolved. After the first quarter of episodes, it seemed as if the writers were rushing because they procrastinated.I am also not sure if it was the writers fault or the actors; because the acting steadily declined, localized on 3 main characters(Tara, Sookie, and Bill). I mean, some of the dialogue was no longer campy but just plain bad. Anna is a good actress but on True Blood she is so horrible now, that I hate to see her screen; I have no idea if it is because of the direction the writers took Sookie or because that is the way they want her to play it. They spent 2 season setting up character traits but most of the main characters have done a 180 this season. I also became exhausted with anything Bill/Sookie related this season; it was like watching a car-wreck on repeat. I enjoyed Pam, Eric, Hoyt/Jessica and Lafayette storylines very much, possibly because they only last 5-10 mins per episode. I disliked how so many new characters were introduced and given plots when the main characters had not been concluded or continued. I watched weekly but I usually watch straight through, so I am wondering if watching the episodes in secession will help. Personally, I think Allan would have fared better if he changed the plots from the books but keep the character traits. Trying to change both is what made season 3 bad, it gets to the point it no longer make sense. I am giving this season 3 stars because the actors are so good and because sadly it is par for the course to have one bad season(i.e season 2 of The Wire).",3,It Was Just Meh.....,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,2787,"['am', 'still', 'quite', 'confused', 'how', 'writer/director', 'Allan', 'Ball', 'considered', 'genius', 'based', 'off', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'mediocre', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'told', 'watch', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'awesome', 'Allan', 'Ball', 'doing', 'hated', 'Later', 'received', 'season', '1', '2', '8-book', 'box', 'set', 'Mrs.', 'Harris', 'novels', 'gift', 'everyone', 'else', 'seemed', 'love', 'thought', 'would', 'as', 'well', 'gave', 'chance', 'read', 'books', 'grew', 'appreciate', 'show', 'ensemble', 'talented', 'actors', 'books', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'have', 'good', 'plots', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'Allan', 'change', 'characters', 'traits', 'as', 'well', 'plots', 'make', 'own', 'being', 'said', 'season', '3', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'least', 'Marianne', 'storyline', 'characters', 'plots', 'were', 'cohesive', 'might', 'have', 'dragged', 'considerably', 'longer', 'then', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'least', 'made', 'sense', 'sort', 'season', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'plots', 'was', 'trying', 'catch', 'watermelons', 'bowl', 'mostly', 'felt', 'empty-handed', 'episode', 'caught', 'little', 'nuances', 'mirror', 'being', 'put', 'up', 'mostly', 'was', 'jumbled', 'hurried', 'mess', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'plots', 'subplots', 'point', 'nothing', 'was', 'truly', 'explored', 'resolved', 'first', 'quarter', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'writers', 'were', 'rushing', 'procrastinated.I', 'am', 'also', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'writers', 'fault', 'actors', 'acting', 'steadily', 'declined', 'localized', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'Tara', 'Sookie', 'Bill', 'mean', 'dialogue', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'campy', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Anna', 'good', 'actress', 'True', 'Blood', 'so', 'horrible', 'now', 'hate', 'see', 'screen', 'have', 'idea', 'direction', 'writers', 'took', 'Sookie', 'way', 'want', 'play', 'spent', '2', 'season', 'setting', 'up', 'character', 'traits', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'done', '180', 'season', 'also', 'became', 'exhausted', 'anything', 'Bill/Sookie', 'related', 'season', 'was', 'watching', 'car-wreck', 'repeat', 'enjoyed', 'Pam', 'Eric', 'Hoyt/Jessica', 'Lafayette', 'very', 'much', 'possibly', 'only', 'last', '5-10', 'mins', 'episode', 'disliked', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'given', 'plots', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'concluded', 'continued', 'watched', 'weekly', 'usually', 'watch', 'straight', 'am', 'wondering', 'watching', 'episodes', 'secession', 'will', 'help', 'Personally', 'think', 'Allan', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'better', 'changed', 'plots', 'books', 'keep', 'character', 'traits', 'Trying', 'change', 'what', 'made', 'season', '3', 'bad', 'point', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'sense', 'am', 'giving', 'season', '3', 'stars', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'sadly', 'par', 'course', 'have', 'one', 'bad', 'season', 'i.e', 'season', '2', 'Wire']",N/A

1318743,A1IB9XKSYUGPGI,B0032JTV6A,A. Schafer,"[36, 41]","I will admit this season had flaws. It did have too many storylines that most people didn't care about (Jason and Arlene's whole storylines for example). However, the plots that were good were really good and entertaining. The Sookie, Bill, Russell, and especially Eric and Pam stuff did not disappoint. Eric's and Russell's arcs were the best of the season. They were not only gripping but left you in agony waiting to find out what happened next. The only other downfall was the Sookie and Bill relationship got tedious being dragged out so long. Sookie began to look like a doormat, and you just wondered how far down the hole she would go. But otherwise, a very good season. If the writers would focus more on the supernatural plotlines and tie in Jason, Sam, and Tara's storylines directly with the more interesting supernatural plot they would achieve the perfect season. But I still say this is the best season because they gave more screentime to the most interesting characters and really focused on character development, which is very important and is something HBO does well and other regular cable shows often lack. Eric is the most captivating character on the show, and it was good to see his character's screentime adjusted in accordance with the books. I have read the books, but I was a show fan first and still perfer the show and I like most of the differences. The main storlyine is still there with changes to add drama. Hopefully Season 4 brings it and I am really looking forward to it!I don't really get the negative reviews calling the show trashy. The whole point of HBO is that they don't have to censor the way other shows do and it allows them to depict the sex scenes and language more realistically. Of course, this is a vampire show, so it's going to be more violent and over the top. But I don't get why anyone would watch this show expecting otherwise. If you don't like fantasy this obviously in not a show for you. T.V. shouldnt be all about reality, it's supposed to be fun and escapism, and True Blood does it in a smart way with underlying themes and messages throughout (that is if you actually bother to look for them).

1318744,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0032JTV6A,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[291, 355]","Following the hedonistic reign of terror of the redoubtable Maryann, the residents of Bon Temps are once again trying to pull their lives back together. For Sookie Stackhouse, events are complicated by the disappearance of her vampire lover Bill Compton, the emergence of a bunch of werewolves on the scene and the machinations of the vampire King of Mississippi. Meanwhile, Sookie's brother Jason pursues a new career in law-enforcement, Sam Merlott tracks down his real parents and Jessica, now broken up with Hoyt, embraces her vampire side more freely. Meanwhile (again), Lafayette gets a boyfriend called Jesus (True Blood? Controversial? Never!) and there are some meth-dealing hicks around causing mischief. And there's this werewolf called Alcide who fancies Sookie and spends a fair bit of time with his shirt off. And Tara gets emotionally abused (yet again) by Thomas Cromwell from The Tudors. And a whole ton of other stuff happened which I'm forgetting right now.True Blood has always been a nutty, camp, somewhat trashy but always resolutely entertaining show, but its third season is nothing less than a sustained, full-scale assault on the viewer's senses and sanity. Learning from the pacing problems in Season 2 (where the latter part of the season degenerated into a tiresome parade of filler orgy scenes for no discernible plot reason), Alan Ball has massively overcompensated, packing every single instant of this season with surprising plot revelations, new characters, surprise reappearances of old characters (including dead ones), new ideas, new races, new concepts and, indeed, the kitchen sink. It's certainly not a dull season, but it is one that is overloaded to the point of near-incoherence.If it's possible to pick out a central thread from this anarchic and demented tapestry of pure chaos, it's the attempt by the vampire King of Mississippi, Russell Edgington, to reverse the policy of appeasement by vampires towards humans and have vampires seize control of the world. Edgington is as barmy as a box of frogs on ecstasy (but still a long way from being the craziest character on the show this season) but is extraordinarily entertaining, played with scene-chewing relish by Denis O'Hare. His lover Talbot, played by Theo Alexander, is almost as amusing. This storyline, where Eric and Bill pretend (or do they?) to defect from the Queen of Lousiana's side to Edgington's and political machinations unfold at his stately home, is the definite highlight of the year, despite the presence of a number of extremely cheesy actors playing 'evil' werewolves who are allied to Edgington.The werewolf storyline otherwise doesn't really go anywhere, despite the pre-season hype touting this as 'the werewolf season'. We do get a promising new regular character in the form of 'good' werewolf Alcide (Joe Manganiello) who manages to remain likable despite inexplicably being attracted to Sookie, who is at her most annoying this year. Hopefully he gets more to do next year.Other storylines range from the mind-bogglingly inane (the meth-dealing hillbilly plot is almost breathtaking in its utter lack of enjoyability) to the compelling (Jessica and Hoyt continue to have the most believable relationship and best chemistry of any pairing on the show). Tara gets emotionally and physically abused and manipulated again to the point where the viewer is in severe danger of losing the last vestiges of sympathy and respect for the character. This story is somewhat saved by James Frain's completely bonkers performance as mentally unstable vampire Franklin Mott (who makes the King of Mississippi look like a stable and reliable fellow), but the writers need to stop using Tara as their emotional punch-bag, especially since they relent with her cousin Lafayette and give him a reasonably happy storyline, complete with a new love interest (which was great up until the hippy-trippy voodoo vision stuff kicked in).There's also a series of plot revelations that hark back to the beginning of Season 1 and earlier, particularly retconning the backstories and motivations for Sam and Bill. In the former case this is laughably unbelievable, whilst the latter works better. Whilst Sookie is rather unlikable this year, Stephen Moyer's performance seems to improve once Bill is given more layers and made into a more duplicitous character than we first thought he was.Overall, this season of True Blood is watchable, but also often headache-inducingly overwrought. The 'Arlene's baby' storyline is unnecessary and tedious, as is the story about Jason's latest romance. The less said about the introduction of the Fae (supernatural beings who apparently dwell within the mystical realm of a Timotei advert) the better. However, we also get a lot more screen-time for Eric and Pam, which is great, and we also get one of the most gloriously demented TV cliffhangers of all time (you'll know it when you see it).True Blood's third season (***) is a cataclysmic explosion of sleaze, storylines and characters, some of which are compelling and some of which are barely watchable tedium. Sorting the good from the bad is hard work this year, but the show is never less than watchable, if also frequently achieving far less than its potential.",3,Completely and totally barking

1318745,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B0032JTV6A,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[1, 1]","Season Three of ""True Blood"": my wife still likes it, I was completely bored. Well, not completely.  There were a few good scenes and some interesting new approaches to the vampire/superpower genre: this season's bad guy was a lot of fun.  However, most of the characters (and most of the actors) have settled into deep, deep ruts and I found myself groaning (sometimes out loud) when they would come onscreen.  The show is plagued by some inherent problems, the biggest of which is the original casting -- many of the actors are simply terrible, and no amount of settling into their roles seems to help.  Perhaps by coincidence, the writing for these characters also tends to be the worst, so when Tara or Jason come onscreen, I cringe.  Another problem is the pacing of the show -- if I had watched it in the original weekly broadcasts, the repetitive scripting probably wouldn't have registered, but plowing through a DVD box set, the story often lacks momentum and characters seem to be spinning their wheels or constantly regressing. They say the same things, enter the same situations, have the same reactions, time and time again. Also, I am hardly a prude, but the ""raunchy"" sex and gimmicky gore also got repetitive - it's like reading DC Comic's Vertigo line, with the same old tropes thrown at you in a desperate attempt to titillate or gross you out. It gets old.""True Blood"" is, I suppose, decent popcorn fare -- light entertainment, trashy, sometimes silly, sometimes fun. But it seems like it should be so much better.  I think the biggest problem is with the acting - Eric (Alexander Skarsgrd) I like, Deborah Ann Woll (Jessica) and Todd Lowe (Terry) too, and Denis O'Hare as ubervamp Russell Edgington was a slithery, malicious delight. But most of the actors are tolerable at best (including Anna Paquin) and some, like Rutina Wesley, are the kiss of death.  And not in a cool, vampirific way.  The redneck stereotypes (particularly with the white trash werewolves and were-panthers) are tiresome: I guess hillbillies are the last big permissible negative media stereotype, but it's kinda played out. Especially when a bluegrass music cue comes up every time they're about to mock the hicks.  I'll probably dutifully watch Season Four, but I barely made it through this one. Oh, well.

I also don't have a problem that the series doesn't match the books plot for plot or character for character.  In some ways I love the direction and integration of new characters injected into the series that weren't in the book or are different.  For example, I love the expanded role of Hoyt, his mother and Jessica, and who doesn't love Lafayette who was just a minor character in the books? I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very open minded and big fan of Alan Ball and have to confess I'm deeply disappointed this season.  What happened here?  For one thing, the introduction that Lafayette has a crazy mama was stupid.  We've seen that with Tara and her alcoholic mother.  And Jason, who's supposed to be a dumb cluck with heart has a completely boring story line with his pursuit of a job in law enforcement and his retrospection.  With the exception of the Crystal character in his life, I could have lived without him this season.  Equally wasteful was Sam's shifter family and the introduction that Sam doesn't have such a saintly past. I'm feeling a little cheated in that I love the show so much that after the 50 minutes or so of each episode, I used to feel as if went by in 5 minutes.

1318755,A388G7Q4E8VG38,B0032JTV6A,"Charles H. Harpole ""Charly""","[1, 1]","Ball's early vision was so much fun, Season 1, with sharp wit and lots of symbolic references to current events and silly social standards (about gays, and more).  However, Season 2 got captured by the Marianne mess which thankfully ended then.  Now, in Season 3 we see the acceleration of keeping many story lines and characters going within any one episode.  That makes late entry into the whole thing rather difficult, but somewhat fun for the fully knowledgable.  However, the producers/writers must have thought that vampires and magic women were not enough and thus have filled Season 3 to such a degree that poor Jason is the only regular person around--everyone, and I mean everyone, is &#34;special&#34; in some way and thrown into the pot of too far over the top characteristics.  Add to that is the strategy of &#34;visiting&#34; each story line for only a couple of minutes at a time, and the jumble does not leave room for any of the great early wit and dilutes the chance to make satire, too.Sensationalism has replaced most of the fun as most characters are pushed beyond their believable limits and plot twists come to substitute for enjoyable coherence often.  Suckee, oops misspelled, has been in bed with almost all the characters by mid #3, and yet with all her trials and tribulations is not allowed to rise to the level of a Candide which would give the series some class and more chance to rise above simple sensationalism.  Poor Bill has been good and then bad and then good so often and with such little motivation that the set dresser should have put out a little sign saying &#34;He is good for a few minutes&#34; to guide viewers.  The Suckie character has the chance of being the innocent abroad in a poluted world, but is not allowed to rise to this satisfying dimension (nor is any other either).This all goes to say that Season 3 allows much less intellectual enjoyment and is mainly a slam-bang kitchen sink mode of plotting and character &#34;development.&#34;  Even while consuming it as a knowing fan, the viewer is reminded of how much has been lost from Season 1.  The &#34;drama&#34; of which of three &#34;men&#34; Suckie will love deeply this minute is sucked away by the creation of a reasonably realistic character manipulated so much beyond justification or coherence.  It may not be possible, by Season 3, to treat this work as anything of any lasting value--a serious violation of its promise in Season 1.Of course, experienced long term viewers can still go along for the roller coaster rides and would be sorry if the show had been ended after Season 2.  And, too, viewers had better see all of 3 if they want to indulge in 4 and then 5 (or more?).  In the end, however, it is just too bad that real inventiveness and deeper satisfaction could not be, somehow, carried on by the poor writers who, by Season 3, have been drained of intelligent fun and must be as pale as their characters now are...in both ways.I wish Season 3 could have staked out satisfying, instead of hodge-podge, new ground.",4,Season 3 gets more weird,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,3043,"['Ball', 'early', 'vision', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Season', '1', 'sharp', 'wit', 'lots', 'symbolic', 'references', 'current', 'events', 'silly', 'social', 'standards', 'gays', 'more', 'However', 'Season', '2', 'got', 'captured', 'Marianne', 'mess', 'thankfully', 'ended', 'then', 'Now', 'Season', '3', 'see', 'acceleration', 'keeping', 'many', 'story', 'lines', 'characters', 'going', 'one', 'episode', 'late', 'entry', 'whole', 'thing', 'rather', 'difficult', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'fully', 'knowledgable', 'However', 'producers/writers', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'vampires', 'magic', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'thus', 'have', 'filled', 'Season', '3', 'degree', 'poor', 'Jason', 'only', 'regular', 'person', 'around', 'everyone', 'mean', 'everyone', '34', 'special', '34', 'way', 'thrown', 'pot', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'characteristics', 'Add', 'strategy', '34', 'visiting', '34', 'story', 'line', 'only', 'couple', 'minutes', 'time', 'jumble', 'not', 'leave', 'room', 'great', 'early', 'wit', 'chance', 'make', 'satire', 'too.Sensationalism', 'replaced', 'most', 'fun', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'pushed', 'believable', 'limits', 'plot', 'twists', 'come', 'substitute', 'enjoyable', 'coherence', 'often', 'Suckee', 'misspelled', 'been', 'bed', 'almost', 'characters', 'mid', '3', 'yet', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'not', 'allowed', 'rise', 'level', 'Candide', 'would', 'give', 'series', 'class', 'more', 'chance', 'rise', 'above', 'simple', 'sensationalism', 'Poor', 'Bill', 'been', 'good', 'then', 'bad', 'then', 'good', 'so', 'often', 'such', 'little', 'motivation', 'set', 'dresser', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'out', 'little', 'sign', 'saying', '34', 'good', 'few', 'minutes', '34', 'guide', 'viewers', 'Suckie', 'character', 'chance', 'being', 'innocent', 'abroad', 'poluted', 'world', 'not', 'allowed', 'rise', 'satisfying', 'dimension', 'other', '.This', 'say', 'Season', '3', 'much', 'less', 'intellectual', 'enjoyment', 'mainly', 'slam-bang', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'mode', 'plotting', 'character', '34', 'development.', '34', 'Even', 'consuming', 'knowing', 'fan', 'viewer', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'been', 'lost', 'Season', '1', '34', 'drama', '34', 'three', '34', 'men', '34', 'Suckie', 'will', 'love', 'deeply', 'minute', 'sucked', 'away', 'creation', 'reasonably', 'realistic', 'character', 'manipulated', 'so', 'much', 'justification', 'coherence', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'Season', '3', 'treat', 'work', 'anything', 'lasting', 'value', 'serious', 'violation', 'promise', 'Season', '1.Of', 'course', 'experienced', 'long', 'term', 'viewers', 'can', 'still', 'go', 'along', 'roller', 'coaster', 'rides', 'would', 'be', 'sorry', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'ended', 'Season', '2', 'too', 'viewers', 'had', 'better', 'see', '3', 'want', 'indulge', '4', 'then', '5', 'more', 'end', 'however', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'real', 'inventiveness', 'deeper', 'satisfaction', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'somehow', 'carried', 'poor', 'writers', 'who', 'Season', '3', 'have', 'been', 'drained', 'intelligent', 'fun', 'must', 'be', 'as', 'pale', 'characters', 'now', 'are', 'ways.I', 'wish', 'Season', '3', 'could', 'have', 'staked', 'out', 'satisfying', 'instead', 'hodge-podge', 'new', 'ground']",N/A

There's no question that he's been set up to be the leading man for the show.  Watch ONLY his scenes from Season 2 and see how he's been made to look compared to Stephen Moyer's character.  Nobody puts Sweden in the corner.  Don't buy Season 2 because the Maenad storyline is terrible but netflix it and then burn a cd of JUST the scenes that are all vampire glamour specifically Eric Northman and Pam and WATCH that cd because you will SEE a specific message being told by Alan Ball.  In Season 3, Watch Eric's eyes in shadow when he first kisses Sookie.  It's a major hint to the real story behind all the wacko Harlequin romance lines that Eric and Sookie keep lobbing at each other like baseballs.  My advice from watching Season 2 is just watch what looks good and fast forward all the rest.  Don't force yourself to watch the disheveled.  Life is too short.  I have watched Season 3 Episode 3 repeatedly for the Eric and Sookie scenes and for anything with Denis O'Hare as the King of Mississippi.

Sookie, his highly resourceful telepathic sister, continues to hold her own in increasingly bizarre, unstable company - vampires, shapeshifters, werewolves (and variations) plus some disconcertingly weird humans. There are also major surprises about her own ancestry.One of television's most atmospheric and unnerving title sequences again precedes another twelve 50+ minute episodes - all highly intense and representing a veritable bloodfest, steamy sex added to the mix. Well done, all, who managed to keep up with the plot twists, ever-changing alliances, struggles for power and returns from the dead.Here is horror with tongue firmly in cheek. Television creator Alan Ball tells how everybody involved has fun. This is perhaps the secret for full enjoyment. (In doubt? Listen carefully when Eric's cell phone rings.) Just short of full self-parody, episodes abound with audacious stunts, sly humour (surprised in bed with a woman, the minister explains she was helping him with his sermon), distinctive dialogue (&#34;I could conversate with you for ever&#34;).The cast are mostly on fine form, their characters evolving interestingly. (Hopefully redheaded waitress Arlene at long last has a worthy man in her life.) Inevitably changes have been made (and will be made) to the Charlaine Harris novels, but many sequences seem remarkably faithful to the originals in the ten books I have so far read. How splendid to know these already contain enough material for more seasons!Several commentaries and interesting bonuses - including features on the wolves (they are for real) and backgrounds to various storylines (including, from start to finish, Bill's stormy relationship with the vampire who turned him).Pushing the boundaries as far as it can, &#34;True Blood&#34; does with gusto, sex and gore exactly what it set out to do.

While I still think the first season was the best, this season builds the story even more and I was on the edge of my seat for the entire summer. In season 3, we find out Sookie is a magical being, not saying what for those that missed this season, which for me was the biggest season reveal. I am captivated by her romance with Bill even though I know according to the book it won't last. She will soon strike up a romance with Eric and I can't wait for that to unfold. It has already started with dreams during this season. It looks like the show is following pretty closely to the book but we shall see what happens. There are several power plays that happen, a lot of politics within the vampire community. Werewolves come into the picture, that bit is very interesting and suprising who from the vampires is involved with them. Sam is reunited with his family, thought they turn out to be a bit shady and rough around the edges. Jason is up to his usual trouble and he finds it no matter what chick he's trying to get with. I really felt for Tara this season, this poor girl can't catch a break. She's tough though and it's kind of gratifying to watch her kick some ass. Poor Andy is so confused and twisted from last season's ordeals he's just trying to save face and contain the situation in Bon Temps.

Thanks, Russell!  I also think it's the proper unveiling of Sookie's true schizophrenia between her want of Bill and Eric and the push/pull all three of them ultimately go through for her sake.  Every episode I like her less and less.  I really do.  And for the love of god did I want Sam's family to die.  Hard.  With a vengeance.  Not nearly as annoying as the dryad woman from season two because of their blissfully limited screen time it was still like nails on a chalk board every time their faces appears on screen.  They did nothing to advance the plot nor did they do anything to advance Sam as a character.  They're all but forgotten in Season 4 so what was the purpose other than to inject more steroids into that Bon Temps drama llama?  As if the show is short on it or something.  You also get a glimpse into the softer side of Eric, his weakness being his maker, Godric.  Touching, really, for someone so vampiric in nature.  It was a moment and I believed it.

1318775,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0032JTV6A,Douglas King,"[14, 18]","Since Season 3 of True Blood ended, I've gone back and watched the first season, and compared to the feverish pace that the show now employs, the first season seems downright slow by comparison. The show, like a formerly morally conflicted baby vampire, seems to have now completely embraced its true nature: that of a wild, crazy, sexy, scary, violent soap opera (albeit an intelligent, well-written and well-acted one).Although the werewolves (as well as were-panthers) make their debut this season, more than anything Season 3 belongs to the crazy vampires. Dennis O'Hare practically hijacks the show, chewing up the scenery as power-hungry Russell Edgington, Vampire King of Mississippi. He also gets the best scene of the season, and possibly the best scene of the series, when he murders a TV reporter on live TV, then lectures American about its narcissism and greed before proclaiming ""we will eat you ... after we eat your children."" It's darkly hilarious, insightful, and scary all at once. Russell truly goes mad after his lover, Talbot, is killed, which is a shame, really, because Talbot was also a hilarious and over-the-top character; a vain, pretentious male vampire housewife. James Frain, an actor I last saw playing King Henry's secretary on the Tudors, also does a hilarious turn playing Franklyn, an obsessive vampire who turns his co-dependent, stalker-ish sense of romance on Tara.Another highlight of the season is Lafayette's reunion with his schizophrenic Mom (played by the formidable Alfre Woodard) and his romance with his mother's nurse, Jesus, who turns out to be a witch. Lafayette and Jesus are probably one of the show's most interesting couples, along with baby vampire Jessica and her mama's boy love interest Hoyt. The show's central pairing, Sookie and Bill, don't fare well at all this season, and as nasty and naughty as he is, by the end of the season you find yourself rooting more for Sookie to finally succumb to Eric's roguish charms, instead of her returning to Bill, who continues to reveal himself to be more duplicitous and weasely than he tries to appear to be.Some of the other storylines don't fare as well, and they tend to be the ones that involve white trash. Sam's subplot with his birth parents went nowhere, and I didn't find a lot interesting about Jason's love affair with Crystal, whose backwoods, meth-dealing family in nearby Hotshot Jason accurately describes as a ""hillbilly freak show"".However, even when the show missteps, it never fails to be entertaining. After three seasons, True Blood is still my favorite current TV show, and when the new episodes are airing it's enough to make Sunday Nights something to look forward to.""I don't know who you think you are, but I know this much is true ...

There's a lot of blood too, this season, which is kind of good, I think.Again, this show is only for adults, since there is way too much adult content (not just revealing, steamy sex scenes, but murder, drugs, and other adult situations) for anyone not 18+ mature.If you liked the first and second seasons, you going to love this one just as much.

OMG, what a great show and what an incredible season.In season 3, the characters are growing ever more real and complex.  Sure, that meant that sometimes scenes were hard to watch, even painful at times, but it was emotionally engaging.  You can love people, but not always like them or what they are doing...and the same can hold true for characters.Sookie is just beginning to come into her own, not just as a person but into an understanding of who she is and where her power lies.  The vampires became both more alien to our sensiblities and yet oddly more understandable at the same time.  Jason is beginning to grow up (finally!!!) and Tara...poor Tara has gone to hell and back and is stronger for it, even if she can't quite acknowledge it yet to herself.My only complaint was that so much was dropped in our laps that it just kept knocking me out of the water.  Whereas the supernatural aspects came much more slowly in season 1, now we are fairly overrun by them...werewolves and witches and more and none of them are all good or all bad.What it boils down to is that this show has created some unforgettable characters that we can grow with and love and yet not always like.  Which makes them all the more REAL.  The show is not dumbed down and it is not simple and it is not always easy to watch.  This season is a clear example of that.  It is fascinating and disturbing and made me laugh and cry and shake my head and, most of all, it made me FEEL.

This season introduces fans to more characters and super natural elements of the show and what it has to offer the fans of the show.  You end up seeing Vampire vs Wearwolves, Witches, so forth inculding what Sookie true indenity is.  Vampire being kidnap and drained for their blood,  Sam tries to find his true family to get some answers to his own questions, Eric wants all wearwolves to pay the price for killing his family 1,000 years ago in a flashback scene.  Sookie goes deep into the wear territory to get some answers of her own, Sookie ends up in the hospital and Bill's blood helps save her from death, Bill tries to let go of Sookie so she can live a normal life on her own,  but she wonders if she can trust Bill or Eric at all.  Great cat fight scene between Debbie and Sookie,  Plus Eric kills Russel's love intrest to get his family crown back into his hands,  the high people of the vampires allow Eric to kill Russel quietly and off the books.  I allow one spoiler Bill tells Sookie she is a Fairy Human Hybrid near end of the season, Eric has a plan to destory Russel then goes with plan B because he sees Godric telling him to forgive Russel but says he will never forgive him.  Sam tells Tara he is a shape shifter and she freaks, Hoyt tells Jessica he wants to marry her and live together, Eric tells Sookie the truth about Bill and Sookie tells them both to get out of her life. The bad ending was the cliff hanger involving Sookie choice she makes at the very end of season three.  So for true fans they will have to buy season four to get answers about this cliff hanger.

1318805,A1OSURJOA9MHM2,B0032JTV6A,Jason from Georgia,"[13, 20]","True Blood is based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries series of novels by Charlaine Harris (which I have regrettably never read but do intend to). It takes place in a small fictional Louisiana town. Being a proud Southerner myself, I thought that the concept of vampires in the South sounded hokey but fun. As it turned out, I loved True Blood seasons one and two! Season 1 in particular captures modern Southern life and mixes it with vampire lore better than I could have ever imagined. Season 2 was entertaining with its over-the-top approach that kept everyone wondering just what was going on! However, season 3 isn't nearly as intoxicating as the first two due to several factors.Season three starts right where season two stopped. After his proposal of marriage to Sookie, Bill Compton is kidnapped by some unknown perpetrators who turn out to be werewolves. Now, many like myself who loath Twilight may be scared by the introduction of werewolves into a vampire series; but I say fear no more for this is executed pretty well with minimal cheese (and hey, some cheese can be good). The main story focuses on Bill Compton (the main vampire), Sookie Stackhouse (hot human girl with mysterious powers), Eric Northman (the guy who seems to like Sookie but also has his own agenda in mind) and newcomer Russell Edgington, the Vampire King of Mississippi who has aspirations of an all-out vampire takeover where humans are like cattle. Denis O'Hare does a masterful job of bringing this character to life (or should I say unlife?) and truly shines as a memorable villain that will not be forgotten. Smaller sub-plots continue from last season and new one's begin such as Terra dealing with the loss of her murdered boyfriend, Sookie's brother Jason and cop Andy Belford working together to cover their tracks, (what an odd pair), Sam seeking out his long-lost family and even issues of pregnancy with Arlene and would-be-father Terry just to name a few. It feels like there are too many characters and plotlines to keep up with and at times it becomes far too chaotic for the viewer. There are so many characters in fact that I simply cannot remember some of their names without having to look them up. Some of the stories are mind-numbingly stupid such as the previously mentioned Arlene's baby plot. I also feel that much of the drama is a bit too soap opera-esk for my more traditional vampire tastes but the main plot has plenty of exciting twists and turns to keep you watching up until the conclusion.Make no bones about it, True Blood remains an ADULT series with tons of extreme gore, violence, nudity and sex. This season tackles some pretty heavy stuff such as rape, more murders and dysfunctional families (white trash). One area where I take some issue with True Blood this season is its obvious bias for the homosexual agenda. I have no problem with the series having gay characters (in the past it's been handled pretty tastefully) but I feel that True Blood pushes its Hollywood politics a bit too much portraying those who are against homosexuality as misguided, hillbilly, drug-using rednecks. It's rather disconcerting to someone like myself who is on the other side of these arguments. Having not read Charlaine Harris' original books yet, I'm not sure if this is the view of the author or not. If it is, then it should be left as is.Sookie and Bill continue to be on again/off again throughout the season. It's gotten to the point where I feel like they need to have some sort of conclusion to the relationship. After all, how many times can these two break up and then get back together? One minute they're having lusty blood-drinking vampire sex while the next Sookie is crying about how the relationship is seemingly forever over. This happens on at least two occasions in season 3.In conclusion, True Blood season 3 is a mixed bag. There are certainly some great things going on here but there are also a lot of storylines that will make you roll your eyes. The main plot is overall well done while some of the sub-plots and characters are nearly unwatchable. If you really liked True Blood seasons one and two then you'll probably want to continue. However, lovers of classic vampire movies and fiction may bare their fangs at various points of the series. Either way, True Blood is in fact coming back for a fourth season and I'm hoping that it will tie up all the lose ends season 3 leaves us with. We can only hope that HBO doesn't pull anything like they did with Spawn or Deadwood and suddenly decide to cancel the show without a proper conclusion.",3,Season 3 isn't nearly as intoxicating as the

1318806,A3F00QUIXGDTOW,B0032JTV6A,Jason Seagraves,"[0, 0]","The actual content of these blu ray discs is outstanding. There are a few so-so episodes, but around 9 or 10 of the 12 are outstanding, as the storyline just goes way over-the-top. If you take the show seriously, you may be disappointed, but my wife and I enjoy it as cheesy, and True Blood has never been cheesier or funner than in Season 3. 5 stars for the actual show!Now, the blu ray discs: W.T.F. First, it takes five minutes -- seriously, five minutes: I'm not using hyperbole -- from the time you insert a disc until the time you can actually play an episode... And that's if everything goes right. Here are some of the instances in which things didn't go right:1. Disc 1, episode 1 was fine. When I later tried to play episode 2, it would not load. It said ""Insert Disc 1"" -- but Disc 1 was already in! So I went to ""Play All"" and it worked. I just had to skip to what I wanted to watch.2. Disc 2 had the same glitch, only when I tried to ""Play All"" after the first episode on the disc, it would not load at all -- it just froze. So I had to pull the disc out and start over; try again. That took another 5+ minutes, and I got the same result. So I pulled it out, reinserted, and tried to go to the episode again, and guess what it said: ""Insert Disc 2."" DISC 2 WAS IN THE PLAYER! I pulled it out, reinserted it, and it started playing (after the five-minute load time, of course), but I wasn't sure it was the right episode, LOL, so I stopped it and repeated the process... This time, it AGAIN, said ""Insert Disc 2."" Another five minutes later, it had been pulled out, reinserted, and this time I let it play and, luckily, I was able to determine that it was the right episode... 15 to 20 minutes after I sat down to watch the show!3. At other times, the menu can pop up and it will say ""cont'd"" with ""play episode"" a selection, but no episode actually selected. When it does this,you're screwed and need to reinsert. If you scroll over to select the episode, it will tell you to insert the proper disc, even though the proper disc is already in! For some stupid reason, you can select any episode from any disc, so obviously it will tell you to insert the proper disc if the episode is on a different disc than the one in the player, but it often tells you to insert the correct disc even if the correct disc is IN the player!Now, once an episode did get loaded, the picture and sound quality was perfect and there were never any glitches, skips, or anything like that. But J.C. on the cross, man! Even if the weird errors I mention above were eradicated, the fact that it takes MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES to load an episode makes these discs worth of one star.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 2]","Unfortunately, endings make the difference in TV seasons, and this one ends with seven distinct soap-operatic cliffhangers.  I counted.  Not just threads lingering to resolve next season, as in the past; I have no problem with that, since they can pique viewers' interest.  No, this season starts seven distinct plot threads and just stops partway through.  Maybe they ran out of time, or bit off more than they could chew.Which is a shame, since the season starts strong.  It introduces interesting conflicts, building confidently on the previous season, that the damage Maryann left in her wake.  This season plays well on sexual tension, contrasting Sookie and Bill's dark romance with Hoyt and Jessica's more lighthearted teen relationship--without compromising Bill and Sookie's love or Hoyt and Jessica's interent torture.Also, this season marks a major shift in focus.  Though still based on Charlaine Harris' novels, this series has introduced so many new characters, like Jessica, and changed so many of Harris' characters, like Lafayette and Tara, that it has become its own creation.  Thus this season spends less time on Sookie's straightforward mystery plotlines and more on the complex networks that hold Bon Temps' community together.But when narrative arcs linger over several episodes, we watch to see how they resolve.  When, at the end, nothing, and I mean nothing, gets resolved, we feel ripped off.  Even Russell Edgington, the main antagonist this season, comes to an end that doesn't so much answer anything as stop everything.  Then, in the clinch, the show starts two new threads, and introduces new powers we never knew Bill had.I liked this season up to the end, but that end left me deflated.  I'll probably watch Season 4, just to see whether they answer anything, but when I walk away from a season scratching my head because I can't see how the characters have progressed, that doesn't suggest the best possible use of screen time.

Loved that she and Hoyt got back together, but that ending with the two of them in their new house was ominous.

Knight,"[0, 0]","I was a little disappointed in season 2 of True Blood, mainly because the Maryann storyline annoyed me and I thought it was given too much dominance over the season....but I'm happy to say that season 3 erased all my concerns. It's such a great season! I loved the fact that Lafayete has a less traumatic season, for the most part, and that the Jason/Crystal story was handled in a believeable way (believeable for Jason, anyway).I especially loved the changes for Bill's character. You don't know what to believe about him (neither does Sookie) and Stephen Moyer plays both parts (good Bill and evil Bill) so well. Like a lot of women viewers, I've completely fallen in love with Eric and his storyline gave his character more depth and understanding. You realize why he is so distant/allouf/cold...he's had 1,000 years of dwelling on grief and vengence. And watching him interact with Pam made me feel so much for each character. He's her maker and she loves him, and you realize how deeply he feels for her, too. It's such a great way to make the audience understand the two characters. Plus I also loved Sookie trying to deal with her growing feelings for Eric...and, I'm not going to lie, watching Eric seduce Talbot was great (and hysterical). Alexander Skarsgard does such a great job and I can't wait to see the next season.I also hope that Tara has a less traumatic experience in season 4....the girl needs a break.

This supernatural drama set in the fictional city of Bon Temps, Louisiana, is a playground for vampires, shapeshifters, and now introduced in the third season, werewolves. The tension between vampires and humans is raised higher than before in this installment, and main character Sookie Stackhouse is about to discover what makes her a coveted prize for anyone who can get her.Sookie is still reeling from the disappearance of her vampire lover Bill. Meanwhile, Bill has been taken to see the vampire king of Mississippi, Russell, who has some big plans for his captive...I mean, guest. Sookie's longtime friend Tara is going through somewhat of an existential crisis until she meets vampire Franklin, who will change her life forever. If that wasn't enough Sookie's brother has fallen for an unattainable mystery woman and her boss is being haunted by his shady past, while her friend Lafayette is trying to develop a relationship with a nurse at his mother's home. Chaos lurks in every corner.While it still has its doses of violence and sex, strangely, this season isn't as fun as the first two. Some episodes seem like they're whipped together on the fly and don't move the plot forward; introductions to new characters mean packing the 44 minute episodes with quick sprints through the main characters' storylines. It feels like a visual relay race. You don't get to see much of anyone for a very long time. Other episodes have the expert craftiness fans have come to expect. There are definite surprises held in store for viewers, it's just too bad most of these come near the end of the season.Still a very entertaining show, TRUE BLOOD: SEASON 3 hit the sophomore slump a year late.

Granted that I have nothing against faeries and the fantasy genre, (I actually don't mind the books dedicated to that like Valiant, Ironside or Tithe by Black) but when those were introduced in the Sookie Stackhouse novels I was very disappointed. I hoped that Alan Ball would stay away from that, since he made a LOT of changes to the original story, but that didn't happen. I did like the story behind the King of Mississippi and Eric, Lafayette continues to be one of my favorite characters and I am glad Ball kept him. The wolves were great (it was nice to see actual wolves and not computer generated ones...) and the actor who played Alcide was one of the few reasons I kept watching... Unfortunately Sookie is still very annoying, Eric has lost some of his evil charm (he is the other reason I kept watching though), and keeping the faeries story line just didn't work for me.

It sucks as in it BLOWS CHUNKS.I'm sorry. I know there are a lot of die-hard fans of this show out there, and I do not mean to offend, but in my opinion, this show has really tanked. I think the Sookie Stackhouse books are terrible, so it doesn't surprise me that I don't like the show. However, I thought Season 1 was a vast improvement over the book, and then Season 2 went downhill really fast, and Season 3 is so bad it's ridiculous. The plots are stupid, the characters are all over the place, and it's just painful to watch.I think the season finale was a major letdown and the way Eric, Bill, Pam, and Sookie dealt with the whole Russell situation was just plain idiotic. We all know Sookie has zero brain cells in her gap-toothed head, but surely Eric and Pam could have been able to come up with a better plan. PLEASE! Jason is usually one of the only tolerable characters on the show, but he was stuck with that annoying Crystal chick all year, which was a total bust. I've hated Tara since Season 2, which is a shame since she started off as a decent character, but these days I just want to slap her. (At least she chopped off that nasty hair at the end of the season.) Then there's Sam...I don't even know where to begin. A few episodes before the finale, everything about Sam's past took on a crazy new dimension, and it just made no sense at all.The only good think about Season 3 is that women were treated to a few Eric butt shots, which was a refreshing change since the gratuitous nudity on this show is generally 90% female.Aside from Eric's backside, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SHOW IS STUPID! Why, when HBO created masterpieces like ""The Sopranos,"" ""Sex and the City,"" and ""Six Feet Under"" (another Alan Ball show, only decent) did the network decide to crank out this garbage?! It makes me sad. (And before you give me grief for watching a show I despise, I only do it because my husband likes it.

This season has introduced some new creatures (werewolves and other shape shifters) but has mainly focused on the TB vampire lore.  Bill has been kidnapped and is the clutches of the Vampire King of Louisianna.  Eric has asserted his power and has usurped his Queen.  Sookie's powers are being expanded and we learn that mind reading is only a small sampling of her powers.This season is a lot more fun as Bill and Sookie have to re-kindle what has been lost.  Jason is still lost.  The werewolves, though a part of this season, are not the unstoppable creatures that they normally are.  In fact they are only slightly stronger than a basic shape shifter.  The one werewolf that has some morals and has befriended Sookie is the best of the new characters.A bunch of characters that were prevelent in the first two seasons have already been disposed of but Lafayette and Tara still remain.  I am assuming we will learn what Sookie really is by the season's end and a showdown with the Vampire King is probably in the cards.  I am sure it will end with another cliff-hanger which will be bigger than the first two seasons.

1318869,AU1ROWBIOKX7X,B0032JTV6A,M. Leister,"[5, 5]","I rented all three seasons of True Blood as they came out with the intention of buying them if I liked them.  Season 3 was the only DVD set I bought.First, I LOVED the Sookie/Eric stuff.  They have two steamy kisses (one real and one in a dream).  I love that he enjoys baiting her and I love that he'd like to care less about her but can't.  Eric was inserted in slowly, but perfectly, as the third point of the love triangle and you really see that this is going to be a triangle this season.Second, I liked how they handled Bill's fall from grace compared to the books.  On TV it was treated as too much badness from him all at once and Sookie having enough.  Although I still don't get what Sookie was so mad about - he didn't know her when he agreed to spy on her and stopped spying when he fell for her, it wasn't like his love was all a lie (which in the books is how it comes off).  Yes, his attack on her in the van was bad, but he didn't do it on purpose (and in the books he raped her too, glad that was left out).  In the books, Bill was going to dump her w/o a word to be with Lorena, it wasn't part of a cover to save Sookie (the way it was played on TV), they made Bill that big a jerk to virtually write him out unless they wanted him to make a feeble attempt at an apology (done once a book) so Sookie could yell at him.Third, I was happy that Sookie was given an active power to use.  Yes she's the damsel in distress, but she has a new trick up her sleeve.  I actually have the feeling her fate isn't wrinkles and gray hair the way it seems to be going in the books.  TV's Sookie might just have a Fairy's immortality too.Fourth, I felt this season dealt more with vampires.  Season two didn't use them much.Fifth, Eric and Pam are a hoot to watch.  More of them PLEASE.One complaint, and this is my complaint about all three seasons, is that Sookie (lead character of the books) gets so little screen time compared to others.  As much as I loved her stuff with Eric and Bill, I felt like they got 5 minutes each episode while I was stuck with other characters for huge chunks of time.  From all the merchandising pushing the love triangle (and they are making it a triangle), more time should be devoted to it.  I'm not saying it should become the Bill/Sookie/Eric show, but taking 2 minutes from each of the other characters each ep and using it for Sookie and her men wouldn't hurt.Most improved character goes to Jason.  Although still dumb, I like that he was trying to make a life for himself.Much as I liked the season, there were dark spots:Jessica, annoying in the first two seasons, was really enjoyable this year, but her story with Holt is BORING.  Time for him to go and her to find someone new.Tara...I'm tired of angry at the world routine because they started her whining long before she had a reason to be so belligerent.  By the time she had a reason (Franklin) I was so sick of hearing her complain I had no sympathy for her.  And no, it was not an abusive relationship, it was a ONS that turned into an abduction.  Tara did what she had to to stay alive and got the better of him.  Also sick of hearing her whine about Eggs (worst character name every).Arlene hates vampires, I get it.  Do I need to hear it every ep?All in all, I'm glad the divided up the story into parts because I can fast forward the parts I find dull without taking from the stuff I enjoy.",5,Loved it!,1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,3400,"['rented', 'three', 'seasons', 'True', 'Blood', 'came', 'out', 'intention', 'buying', 'liked', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'only', 'DVD', 'set', 'bought.First', 'LOVED', 'Sookie/Eric', 'stuff', 'have', 'two', 'steamy', 'kisses', 'one', 'real', 'one', 'dream', 'love', 'baiting', 'love', ""'d"", 'like', 'care', 'less', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Eric', 'was', 'inserted', 'slowly', 'perfectly', 'third', 'point', 'love', 'triangle', 'really', 'see', 'going', 'be', 'triangle', 'season.Second', 'liked', 'how', 'handled', 'Bill', 'fall', 'grace', 'compared', 'books', 'TV', 'was', 'treated', 'too', 'much', 'badness', 'once', 'Sookie', 'having', 'enough', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'Sookie', 'was', 'so', 'mad', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'agreed', 'spy', 'stopped', 'spying', 'when', 'fell', 'was', ""n't"", 'love', 'was', 'lie', 'books', 'how', 'off', 'Yes', 'attack', 'van', 'was', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'purpose', 'books', 'raped', 'too', 'glad', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'books', 'Bill', 'was', 'going', 'dump', 'w/o', 'word', 'be', 'Lorena', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'cover', 'save', 'Sookie', 'way', 'was', 'played', 'TV', 'made', 'Bill', 'big', 'jerk', 'virtually', 'write', 'out', 'wanted', 'make', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'apology', 'done', 'once', 'book', 'so', 'Sookie', 'could', 'yell', 'him.Third', 'was', 'happy', 'Sookie', 'was', 'given', 'active', 'power', 'use', 'Yes', 'damsel', 'distress', 'new', 'trick', 'up', 'sleeve', 'actually', 'have', 'feeling', 'fate', ""n't"", 'wrinkles', 'gray', 'hair', 'way', 'be', 'going', 'books', 'TV', 'Sookie', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'Fairy', 'immortality', 'too.Fourth', 'felt', 'season', 'dealt', 'more', 'vampires', 'Season', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'much.Fifth', 'Eric', 'Pam', 'are', 'hoot', 'watch', 'More', 'PLEASE.One', 'complaint', 'complaint', 'three', 'seasons', 'Sookie', 'lead', 'character', 'books', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'compared', 'others', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'stuff', 'Eric', 'Bill', 'felt', 'got', '5', 'minutes', 'episode', 'was', 'stuck', 'other', 'characters', 'huge', 'chunks', 'time', 'merchandising', 'pushing', 'love', 'triangle', 'are', 'making', 'triangle', 'more', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'devoted', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'become', 'Bill/Sookie/Eric', 'show', 'taking', '2', 'minutes', 'other', 'characters', 'ep', 'using', 'Sookie', 'men', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt.Most', 'improved', 'character', 'Jason', 'still', 'dumb', 'like', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'himself.Much', 'liked', 'season', 'were', 'dark', 'spots', 'Jessica', 'annoying', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'year', 'story', 'Holt', 'BORING', 'Time', 'go', 'find', 'someone', 'new.Tara', ""'m"", 'tired', 'angry', 'world', 'routine', 'started', 'whining', 'long', 'had', 'reason', 'be', 'so', 'belligerent', 'time', 'had', 'reason', 'Franklin', 'was', 'so', 'sick', 'hearing', 'complain', 'had', 'sympathy', 'was', 'not', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'was', 'ONS', 'turned', 'abduction', 'Tara', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'stay', 'alive', 'got', 'better', 'Also', 'sick', 'hearing', 'whine', 'Eggs', 'worst', 'character', 'name', '.Arlene', 'vampires', 'get', 'Do', 'need', 'hear', 'ep', ""'m"", 'glad', 'divided', 'up', 'story', 'parts', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'parts', 'find', 'dull', 'taking', 'stuff', 'enjoy']",N/A

It is the only show that I would even shell out $15 a month extra just to get HBO to watch it. I also spend the money to buy the seasons on DVD. The 3rd season of this show is an improvement from the 2nd season. Gone is the weird, mystical maenad, and in steps one of the best characters of the show so far: Russell Edgington. Nothing can measure up to the first season of this show for me, but this season was vastly entertaining. Many new characters were introduced, from the sexy werewolf Alcide to the inbred delights of Hot Shot. Perhaps too much is going on in this season. My biggest complaint of the show, and the real reason I can't give it 5 stars, is because Alan Ball does insist on giving even the most secondary of characters storylines and at least 5 minutes of screen time an episode. With this many characters on a show, this just isn't feasible. The show is amazing when it focuses on Sookie and her relations with the vampire community, especially Bill and Eric.This show is definitely worth watching if you: love vampires, want to watch a super sexy and talented cast that tackles great writing, are a fan of HBO fare, or maybe are just even looking for something new to enjoy.

It continues everything that we've come to love (or love to hate) about the first two seasons. This includes the great with the less than worthy, the fascinating with the mind-numbingly boring, the intriguing with the trite.First, some of the best points about season 3: the orgies of season two are no more, and the vampires start to show a little more character. We meet a host of new, interesting people. There are a lot of good substories, and we learn something about Eric's past.The Bad: There are a few weak sub stories. Jason Stackhouse and his (new) girlfriend and Lafayette's and Jesus' lineage are a few that pop to mind. Plus, the idea that everyone in town has some magical ability or another is getting pretty old. Witches, fairies, vampires, shape shifters, leopard shape shifters, etc. Really? And the idea that so many of the people you know and ""trust"" from early on actually have dark secrets and are really pretty horrible people is...unsettling. Sam's change of character is really the worst instance of this, I think.There really is a lot that happens in this season. Without giving too much away, we end up finding out that Gentleman Bill is hardly what he appears; evil Eric is not all that he appears; and the politics of the vampire world is even more involved than we had originally known. We meet new characters and creature types, including werewolves. All of these new characters, unexpected perils, and shifting loyalties are bound to keep viewers interested -- so that, even when the silly parts come along, they're not that distracting. This is definitely better than season 2 in many respects, although some of it is not as good. 4/5 stars -- a solid continuation of the story.(EDIT: Oh, and, as with the earlier seasons, there is a lot of sex and violence in season 3, as well as a few homosexual sex scenes.

They have lost the plot, trying to be extreme in an effort to impress.  It is possible the show is now so disjointed because the writers no longer use the road map set by the original book author, Charlaine Harris.  Of course both the DVDs and books are from Amazon.These episodes are hard to take. Even some of the stars look puzzled and out of place as they attempt to act out some nonsensical new roles allotted to them.  For example, the new paths taken by the gay chef Lafayette accompanied by his most unlikely mental nurse boyfriend. Tara seems all at sea and might as well not be in the show. Poor old Jason has a part to play that suggests he should have been placed in a straightjacket at the start of this Series.  Poor old Sam loses his cool when he finds his dysfunctional family and wanders through the episodes looking for a place to land.Even Sookie looks riddled by doubt in the closing episodes.  Pretty tough role to play - starting from a willing sex oject of a couple of old hardened Vampires, only to end this series taking on an Angelic part to rival a young Mother Teresa.Never mind, Amazon has a huge stock of first class shows and movies; it will remain a pleasure to scroll through them and order.Richard GlenisterAustralia",1,True Blood not so True anymore,1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,1590,"['new', 'series', 'recently', 'arrived', 'Amazon', 'best', 'described', 'sad', 'viewing', 'experience', 'shame', 'promising', 'commencement', 'first', 'two', 'Series.Each', 'new', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Third', 'Season', 'written', 'different', 'screen', 'writer', 'seven', 'different', 'Directors', 'calling', 'shots', 'just', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'have', 'lost', 'plot', 'trying', 'be', 'extreme', 'effort', 'impress', 'possible', 'show', 'now', 'so', 'disjointed', 'writers', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'road', 'map', 'set', 'original', 'book', 'author', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'course', 'DVDs', 'books', 'are', 'Amazon.These', 'episodes', 'are', 'hard', 'take', 'Even', 'stars', 'look', 'puzzled', 'place', 'attempt', 'act', 'out', 'nonsensical', 'new', 'roles', 'allotted', 'example', 'new', 'paths', 'taken', 'gay', 'chef', 'Lafayette', 'accompanied', 'most', 'unlikely', 'mental', 'nurse', 'boyfriend', 'Tara', 'sea', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'be', 'show', 'Poor', 'old', 'Jason', 'part', 'play', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'straightjacket', 'start', 'Series', 'Poor', 'old', 'Sam', 'cool', 'when', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'wanders', 'episodes', 'looking', 'place', 'land.Even', 'Sookie', 'riddled', 'doubt', 'closing', 'episodes', 'Pretty', 'tough', 'role', 'play', 'starting', 'willing', 'sex', 'oject', 'couple', 'old', 'hardened', 'Vampires', 'only', 'end', 'series', 'taking', 'Angelic', 'part', 'rival', 'young', 'Mother', 'Teresa.Never', 'mind', 'Amazon', 'huge', 'stock', 'first', 'class', 'shows', 'movies', 'will', 'remain', 'pleasure', 'scroll', 'order.Richard', 'GlenisterAustralia']",N/A

Sookis (Anna Paquin), the little southern bell, Bill (Stephen Moyer) the handsome Vamp, Jason (Ryan Kwanten), the hardbodied sex machine, Tara (Rutina Wesley), the wild sharped tounged BFF of Sookie's, Sam (Sam Trammell), the too nice bar owner boss to many of the local girls, Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), the flamboyant drag queen chef and the list goes on and on,The show is campy, funny, sexy and seductive, sad, violent and filled with blood and gore and a whole lot of people running around naked and having sex.The show has a billion layers to it as well as plot twists that will keep you on your toes especially in the third season when the show picks up the pace from the slow pace of season two. the pace is so fast that you better not leave the room for a second, yes its that wild and that crazy.As I hinted to the second season was a bit slow and not near as good as the first season, but season three is just a little to crazy for me. It was still good, but season one is the raining champ for me of the three seasons that I've watched so far.The show has me somewhat perplexed with the evolution most if not all of the characters and the direction they have taken. I liked many of the characters, but now they all seemed to have turned (I'll leave it at that so I won't spoil any of the characters for you) and not necessarily in a good way. I must confess my fav character is/was Lafayette who stole the show in season one and part of season two.This show is NOT FOR KIDS as it has all of the vices covered and uncovered many times over.

1318900,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0032JTV6A,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","HBO's ""True Blood"" has earned die-hard fans from its delightful combination of horror, humor, and sex.  There is just enough meat on the bones of this story - vampires living among us serving as parables on homophobia, the war on drugs, religious and political hypocrisy, and the myteries of true love - that you can watch it with pride even as the gallons of blood and the boundless physical charms of the cast are constantly on screen for our more base pleasures.Season Three, however, tests the viewer's patience by injecting a dizzying range of storylines into the mix.  Some of these are terrific - the highlight of the season without a doubt is the introduction of Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare), the Vampire King of Mississippi, into our cast.  O'Hare, an actor's actor, embodies this 3,000-year old powerhouse with a masterful combination of weariness and power.  His character seems to have been created for only one season, but after this performance rest assured that he'll be back for more lip-smacking, spine-ripping fun.Other developments are less-than-satisfying.  Do we need a clan of inbred meth-dealing shapeshifters?  Do we need a vampire-blood-as-steroids storyline featuring Jason Stackhouse worrying about past glories?  Can Tara ever stop crying?  Why did Lafayette's prim boyfriend suddenly get so interested in doing V?  And what does it mean that Sookie is a fairy, and will that be, as she says, ""so [effing] lame""?  Are Bill and Sookie going to become HBO's Ross and Rachel, forever breaking up and reuniting?  All these storylines - and there are many others - build to a less-than-satisfying finale that leaves as many questions as it answers.The good news is that we will have Season Four (and probably several more) with which to work these things out.  The bad news is that we'll have to wait patiently during the shapeshifters' scenes (Sam Merlotte was also disappointingly bland this season, even though we learned about his dark side, too) as we wait for the much-more fascinating stuff with the cherished core of the show.",4,Season Three treads a fine line - how much new is too much?,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,2061,"['HBO', 'True', 'Blood', 'earned', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'delightful', 'combination', 'horror', 'humor', 'sex', 'just', 'enough', 'meat', 'bones', 'story', 'vampires', 'living', 'serving', 'parables', 'homophobia', 'war', 'drugs', 'religious', 'political', 'hypocrisy', 'myteries', 'true', 'love', 'can', 'watch', 'pride', 'even', 'gallons', 'blood', 'boundless', 'physical', 'charms', 'cast', 'are', 'constantly', 'screen', 'more', 'base', 'pleasures.Season', 'Three', 'however', 'viewer', 'patience', 'injecting', 'dizzying', 'range', 'storylines', 'mix', 'are', 'terrific', 'highlight', 'season', 'doubt', 'introduction', 'Russell', 'Edgington', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'Vampire', 'King', 'Mississippi', 'cast', ""O'Hare"", 'actor', 'actor', '3,000-year', 'old', 'powerhouse', 'masterful', 'combination', 'weariness', 'power', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'performance', 'rest', 'assured', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'more', 'lip-smacking', 'spine-ripping', 'fun.Other', 'developments', 'are', 'less-than-satisfying', 'Do', 'need', 'clan', 'inbred', 'meth-dealing', 'shapeshifters', 'Do', 'need', 'vampire-blood-as-steroids', 'storyline', 'featuring', 'Jason', 'Stackhouse', 'worrying', 'past', 'glories', 'Can', 'Tara', 'ever', 'stop', 'crying', 'Why', 'did', 'Lafayette', 'prim', 'boyfriend', 'suddenly', 'get', 'so', 'interested', 'doing', 'V', 'what', 'mean', 'Sookie', 'fairy', 'will', 'be', 'so', '[', 'effing', ']', 'lame', 'Are', 'Bill', 'Sookie', 'going', 'become', 'HBO', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'forever', 'breaking', 'up', 'reuniting', 'storylines', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'build', 'less-than-satisfying', 'finale', 'as', 'many', 'questions', 'good', 'news', 'will', 'have', 'Season', 'Four', 'probably', 'several', 'more', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'bad', 'news', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'patiently', 'shapeshifters', 'scenes', 'Sam', 'Merlotte', 'was', 'also', 'disappointingly', 'bland', 'season', 'even', 'learned', 'dark', 'side', 'too', 'wait', 'much-more', 'fascinating', 'stuff', 'cherished', 'core', 'show']",N/A

Out of the entire series, my favorite character is Franklin, the insane vampire. He is played brilliantly by James Frain who captures the character's essence of insanity perfectly. My two major complaints are the story lines of Sookie and her brother Jason. I may be alone on this one but I find Jason's story line to be so boring that I actually was fast forwarding through all of his parts. I just didn't care at all about his new found love from some abused ""were-panther"". And the constant breaking up and making up between Bill and Sookie has become to tediously boring. Don't get me wrong, I love Bill and Sookie as a couple, but they keep breaking up and making up about the same plot all the time.It is nice to find out what Sookie actually is. But I am also not happy about the lack of comedy in the series anymore. The one thing about Lafayette in the first series is that he was a tough and funny person. I get that he went through some dramatic stuff, but the lack of comedy is kind of ruining it for me.

Started reading the books recently and am finding that the books are more interesting... perhaps because leaving something to the imagination allowed for more thought. Although it was nice to finally be able to see this, watching all three seasons really underlined all the problems with the show. there were lots of talented folks involved with the production that really did a great job. It was the script  and character development that was irritating in a way that the books weren't.  I found myself just plain sick of the aggressively bossy and stupid actions by the alive major characters, particularly the women who of course blamed everything on the undead.  The lack of rational thinking combined with the incredible narcissism of all the characters  really was trying after many episodes...it wasn't funny or interesting when it became a broken record.  And Sookie, the virgin, being a carnival acrobat her first time, was silly. The sex became boring quickly as the episodes were viewed in a short time. yeah I think we got that they were doing it a lot, but the excess time could have been used in providing more dialog & character development. It probably serves as their personal record of their courtship in real life, but there was way too much of every episode spent on choreographed sex, but no time building a believable courtship of the characters.it was so much it was boring.

1318909,AHCUFJHJAD6HP,B0032JTV6A,S. McKinney,"[5, 5]","I was very anxious for True Blood Season 3 to open with Sookie's getting her house put back in order. I mean, really - how long is she going to carry on with those patches of moldy mud speckling the walls and dried vines woven through the staircase banister and trailing across the curtain rods? I know for a fact that her Gran would have a conniption fit.Instead, True Blood opened with Sookie anxiously seeking help in finding Bill, so hell-ooooo, Alcide. The whole Bill-gone-missing thing is part of the original Sookie novels, but the way he's found differs a bit. I found I didn't mind the liberties Alan Ball took with those details nearly as much as I minded the whole Maenad Madness huge, enormous, season-stealing detail of *last* season, so all was well. It got a bit boresome from time to time with Lorena -- did we really need to travel through every single era since the Civil War, seeing Lorena and Bill in little vignettes (Gay Nineties, Roaring Twenties, Prohibition-era...the only thing we missed was Lorena and Bill draining acid-tainted hippies at Woodstock) to have proof that Lorena was a Bad Vampire? Anyway, the whole Russell Edgington thing played out well (Talbot was brilliantly funny) and I was breathless if wondering if the HBO Eric and Bill would break faith with Sookie in ways that the Book Eric and Bill never would have. Tantalizing!But. But, but, but.In between all the interesting scenes, one is forced to deal with Jason (whom I still love) getting all cozy with Crystal Norris from Hotshot, and here's where the series lost me. In the books, Hotshot is an inbred, overbred little crossroads clan, filled with inter-related people who were secretive, and poor but proud. In the series, the citizens of Hotshot have become hillbilly meth-cookers (Hoyt gets a great line when he says, ""This girl is from Hotshot? If her first name is Crystal, her middle name is probably Meth""), and they're all so weird, you can practically hear the banjo music theme from ""Deliverance"" playing in the background. It's impossible to say what attracts Jason so wildly to Crystal -- animal magnetism? -- but she's the complete opposite of every girl who has ever attracted Jason before. He's always tended toward the trashy and flashy, but Crystal is pure-d backwoods hick. I don't get it. The storyline was so dragged out, so pointless and dumb, that by the time Jason decided he wanted to be a p'leeceman so's he could go 'n whup them dudes fr'm Hotshot f'r bein' s'mean to his Crystal, I wanted to pin a shiny brass star on his forehead.And this is from a character I *like*Which brings us to Tara. Rutina Wesley is such a fabulous actress and she does not deserve this hideous role. As in the books, Tara gets involved with Franklin Mott (who has morphed into Mickey in the series) and it's just one more looooong dullllll tale of Tara being worked over by a man. This story is so distasteful, I don't even feel like going into it for the sake of a review, but let's just say that she ends up in a rape crisis group. I want Tara to move to Chicago in the worst way. It was awful. I hated every second of it, and spent my time fast-forwarding through Tara's scenes and fuming at the ineptness of Alan Ball. You'd think he would have learned from the Maryann storyline from Season 2 not to provoke the (largely female) audience with nasty sex. Orgies didn't flip anyone's switch in Season 2, and rape scenes don't do it in Season 3. We can only be thankful that it didn't take up most of the season.And as if that all weren't enough, we had to suffer through the story of Sam and his hideous birth family, which dragged on and on and on and on and on and...oops, sorry, and didn't end well, which you could see from the very beginning. Any time you meet your biological dad and he's wearing nothing but baggy, greyish underpants that barely contain his enormous sagging package, you just know you're not in for a happy reunion.One big, bright spot in the season though was the Jessica/Hoyt/Summer triangle. It was adorable and funny.My feeling is that the series is veering way too far away from the novels, thereby losing its integrity. That loss of integrity is resulting in increasingly overwrought story arcs that are painful to watch. I miss the times in the books where all that was going on was Sookie sitting in her lawn chair, painting her toenails and drinking sweet tea. That was actually one of the things that made Sookie so personable. I realize that a series based on a character who was seen washing her hair, doing her nails, weeding the flowerbeds or cleaning out the closets in every episode would get very old after a while for different reasons, but maybe that would be better than the feverish and frenzied pace that's been set so far. It doesn't make me want to watch True Blood more; it makes me want to watch it less.",2,Moments of brilliance interspersed with long stretches of agony,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,4861,"['was',

It was actually the catalyst that got me interested in the books.  I read the First Book after viewing Season One and loved it.  I was impressed how closely Alan Ball had followed the book and was excited to see further seasons of the True Blood series.  Season Two was a horrible disappointment that I actually thought couldn't get worse.  Alas, Season Three was irksome to say the least.  There isn't anything closely resembling the books other than the names of some of the characters.  My biggest wish is for Alan Ball to stop doing any further damage to this wonderful series of stories written by Charlaine Harris.

1318923,AMC2QD9MTG2ZB,B0032JTV6A,Trixie,"[172, 207]","This season started off with a fantastic bang, but as it progressed the episodes became increasingly stupid and disappointing. The third season's main plot point is the exciting kidnapping of Bill by the King of Mississippi who has a pack of V-addicted werewolf henchman. Naturally, Sookie does everything she can to save her man with Eric both preventing and/or helping her in her endeavors. However, this season bombards the viewers with too many new characters and subplots. There are literally more than a dozen new characters, and most of the already established characters (Layfayette, Sam, Tara, Jessica, Jason, Arlene, etc) seem to have their own subplots going on. Some of the characters rarely have any interaction with each other, but only with the new characters in their own personal story. In fact the subplots take up so much of the show that I often feel like I am watching 4 or more shows at once. Along with new characters there are several new ""supes"" (supernaturals) that are introduced in this season including werewolves, werepanthers, fairies/""fae"", and witches. I also find it strange that a good amount of the ""supes"" are backwater, dirty hicks who don't even look classy enough for a trailer park. Some cheesy and downright stupid scenes make viewers feel that perhaps True Blood is going in the direction of every other vampire show, book or movie, which is mind-numbing stupidity. Possibly the worst part about this season was the finale, which was a horrible episode, nonetheless horrible season finale. In fact I think it was probably the worst episode of True Blood I have ever seen.However, this is not to say this season did not have some great twists and turns to keep viewers on the edge of their seat. So in light of lots of criticism I will highlight some of the best parts of Season 3.1. Background about Eric's life as both a human and vampire2. We learn ""what"" Sookie is and why she can read minds and shoot light from her fingertips3. Eric and Pam's maker-progeny relationship is presented in a deeper and more meaningful manner4. We learn more about vampire hierarchies and politics5. Jessica's adjustment to her vampire identity and struggling with her relationship with Hoyt6. We see a darker side of the gallant and gentlemanly Bill7. We see a lighter side of the cold and cruel Eric8. Some amusing one liners (ex: ""His cheese done slid off his cracker!"") But they best be careful with this lest they put too much effort into ""funny"" lines and not meaningful dialogue9. Some awesome fight scenes10.

It was enjoyable and very solid entertainment. I actually got into this show by watching this season during its original airing. However, going back and watching the first two seasons, I see how the quality of writing began to dip a little in this season. There were just way too many storylines. The objective was introduce several new characters but it did so at the expense of cohesion. Most of the main characters went numerous episodes without even interacting. It made things feel too chaotic and disrupted the tight-knit, small-town feel of the show. There were also a couple of storylines I could've absolutely done without, such as Hoyt's romance with Summer and those Hotshot trash. Just too unnecessary.However, I will say that despite the flaws of the season, it's still a hell of a lot of fun to watch. The Big Bad of this season is Russell Edgington, who's quite arguably the most popular Baddie among the True Blood fans. Like Michelle Forbes in season two, Denis O'Hare is utterly charismatic and chews the scenery with vigor. He's just so much fun to watch. Talbot (Theo Alexander) and Franklin (James Frain) are two of my other favorites this season. Alexander is hilariously petulant yet I also sympathized at his lover's constant neglect of him. Frain is strangely likable for a psychopath and has some fantastic lines. I also completely enjoyed the return of Lorena (Mariana Klaveno) who's probably crazier and more desperate for Bill this year than the last.It would be difficult to comment on every single story and character. Joe Manganiello provides some amazing eye candy as Alcide, possibly another love interest for Sookie. Kevin Alejandro gives a sensitive portrayal of Jesus, finally providing the ever-fabulous Lafayette with a love interest of his own. I also really like Marshall Allman as Tommy, Sam's long-lost brother who's equal parts abrasive and sympathetic.The primary characters are sometimes lost in the shuffle. There were many character changes going on that, compared to the characterizations of seasons past, I wasn't a huge fan of. Tara lost some of her sass, Sam went really dark, and Bill proved to be shadier than we all thought. This all seemed to be part of the season's objective, to reveal everyone's secrets, which led up to the biggest secret revealed regarding Sookie's identity. I read a couple reviews saying Sookie was unlikable in this season. I disagree. Sookie was possibly one of the few original characters who I consistently liked all year. The girl had it rough, anyway.In my ranking of the seasons, this one would have to come last. It's still amazing television, much better than 90% of what's out there, especially on network TV.

1318935,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B0032JTV6A,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[1, 1]","I love to sit back and watch an entertaining TV show that doesnt insult your intelligence. Unfortunately, I can count on ONE HAND the number of shows like that in the last 20 years. (LEXX, MST3K, FUTURAMA, TRUE BLOOD, 6 FEET UNDER) I was hooked on this show from the first episode. Truebies end up reading all the Charlaine Harris SOOKIE STACKHOUSE books, looking for spoilers on the net, and even have been known to go as far as paying 7.99$ for a 4-pack of TRUE BLOOD at the Mall. (Blood Orange soft drink.) The third season, for those keeping score, was based on the third novel of the SOOKIE STACKHOUSE books, AKA ""CLUB DEAD"". Alan Ball does a great job of translating the books, narrated in the first person via Sookie, into a fully fleshed out community of various supernatural beings all trying to pass as humans, along with ""Fang Bangers"", which are humans trying to pass themselves off as supernatural beings (read: Vampires. It pokes fun at the Goth culture.) Nothing is as it seems, and cliff hangers are the order of the day, in this update of the DARK SHADOWS vampire soap opera of the 1960s. Alan Ball has actually pulled in scenes from various SOOKIE novels, in order to introduce more of the characters and plot lines earlier than say....book six. So, even tho book THREE (CLUB DEAD) is what season three is based upon, outside of Alcide, werewolves, the werewolf bar, Crystal and Hotshot community, Jackson Mississippi and the Vampire king, and Bill's disappearance, a good deal of what goes on here, is the invention of the TRUE BLOOD writing staff. As much as I love watching the series, I do have problems with the way some of the characters get make overs, and the way plot points from future books are pulled into this season. (The FAE material, for example, or how the TOPCAT of Hotshot, Calvin, is made into an evil inbred redneck, instead of the noble working man from the novels, who has a crush on Sookie.) OF course diverging from the novels began in the first season with the way TARA's role was expanded, and how Lafayette survived not being killed off at the end of season one, as happened in the books.Not remaining true to the books has its positive and negative points. On the positive side, you cant use the book's plot points, as a way to predict what you are going to see in any one episode. Alan Ball has made the show his own, removing stale, pointless running jokes from the books (like the BUBBA-ELVIS vampire character), and inserting new and interesting characters, like Jessica, Sam's brother Tommy, or Russel Edgington's boyfriend. Franklin's appearance in this season, when he should have been in season 5 I believe, worked out well, as did Sookie's discovery of her own supernatural backround. But for those who havent had a least SOME foreknowledge about the basic plot for season three, the complicated, interwoven plotlines, and huge cast of characters, can become confusing. The books have unifying factors built into their concept, mostly because the entire book is seen from Sookie's perspective. Also, Ms. Harris's books have fewer characters, and fewer storylines running concurrently. Because Alan Ball decided to make the TRUE BLOOD story dense with characters and overlapping storylines, this season especially recieved some negative criticism because too much was going on at the same time, and people became confused. It was only after i watched the show a couple of times after recieving SEASON THREE, that i saw the interlocking pieces of the puzzle in a more unifying light. Jessica and Holt work as a foil for the Sookie and Bill relationship. Sam's family problems are a foil for Tara's family problems, and Lorena's psychopathic love is a foil for Franklin's psychopathic love for Tara. There are SO MANY of these little plot devices woven into the story, that with a little bit of work, and multiple viewings, the OVERARCHING UNITY of the third season (as well as the series' storyline as a whole), provide you with a series that is MORE than the parts it's made of. Other people complain about the sexual content. BUT HEY, Vampires and sexual obscession have gone together like peanut butter and jelly since the very first vampire films. What worked as sexual obsession in the 1930s with Bela cant work today. The entire mythology of supernatural beings has been provided a totally post modern update, starting with genetically engineered human blood itself, aka TRUE BLOOD. Like any show that involves fantasy, suspension of disbelief is nessacary, or else the vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, witches, and fairies just seem like child entertainment. Well, this show is NOT for children....its a definate RATED R. Also, the homophobia of the fundamentalist south is transformed into vampirephobia, just as the southern addiction to Oxycotin was turned into addiction to ""V"".  In fact, for the number of supernatural creatures that populate the show, its surprising how totally HUMAN their concerns and interactions are. Vampire/human couples face the same discrimination that interracial couples face, Goth culture still has its posiers, there's incest in the backwoods communities, even vampire ""royalty"" that mirrors human ""royalty"" based on mega wealth. (you'll notice the kings and queens of the various states, are filthy rich). The number of psychopaths in Bon Temps seems to be a bit over the top, but at least they can be vampires as much as humans. Werewolves are revisioned as bikers, both ""good"" bikers like Alcide, and the ""hell's angel's"" types brain-cooked on drugs, like Cooter. (The neo-nazi tendicies of the Hell's Angel biker group, is even addressed in the TV show, tho not the books.)The extras are almost always entertaining, tho the POST MORTEMS range from Alan Ball talking about how much fun it was working with REAL wolves, to fake TV talk shows discussing the politics of vampire equal rights, and fake training films for vampires who face fighting werewolves. Some of the post mortems were not that thought out, especially the two IN MEMORIA post mortems, which were collections of clips. BUT HEY, they are there if you want them. The show analysis and commentary tracks can be lots of fun, especially when combination occur like the actor for Vampire Bill, and Sookies brother get together, since they both have british accents. Knowing the little bits about the filming, and acting, and writing that went into even the most transitory scenes, helps you to appreciate the amount of time and attention to detail this show contains. (Again, thank ALAN BALL for that.) Every actor is top notch, and every special effect is convincing within the framework of the show. So, for TRUEBIES, or if you enjoyed season ONE and/or SEASON TWO, its not even a question...you will no doubt buy season THREE. Personally, I'd do this NOW, and study the third season as much as you can, because so many CLUES have already been introduced, that set up season four. At the end of the 3rd season, we are all set up for witches, the Jason-Crystal relationship, the Sookie-Eric relationship, and the fight between the witches and.....oh, you'll see. It's obvious the Truebies are going to become DEAD TO THE WORLD when HBO begings broadcasting TRUE BLOOD SEASON 4 at the end of June 2011. Obviously, watching TRUE BLOOD isnt the same as watching a Werner Herzog film, but since this is an HBO production, you are watching TV production at its finest. The only people I'd NOT recommend this show to, would be children under 16, homophobes, hemophobes, and possibly elderly people over the age of 79. (the culture that is portrayed is a bit randy for the elderly. In fact, season 2 included full frontal nudity, and at least one scene of erotica per episode.) As for everyone else, this is a very addictive show, and proves that TV can STILL be fun, without capitulating to reality TV, shock newscasts, or nascar.",5,PREP WORK for SEASON FOUR,1307491200,"06 8,
