That's what Ground Zero is all about but I don't know if that's enough.I'm a big supporter of low-budget movies. Through the years, I've seen quite a few that were great movies, then others that were real stinkers. Take a guess where I'd put Ground Zero at. Sadly, it'd be on the lower end of that spectrum. For a zombie movie, it was okay. It did keep my interest in my watching it and the cinematography was good. However, there were times when this movie was an absolute bore..then, it'd pick up the pace only to bore me again. Seemed as though it was having a hard time making up its' mind what it was wanting to do.Ground Zero is worthy of a rental, if nothing else. It's not THAT bad of a zombie movie.

I actually didn't feel like I had once again been raped by Amazon when I rented this movie. Not overly gory (not that I dislike gore), and not overly scary (a shortcoming).

If I would have paid $3.99 I would have found myself on the ""cusp"" of feeling slightly ripped off but overall it was worth the approx. hour and a half that the movie took away from my life and I was somewhat entertained by viewing the movie.I would not buy a disc of this movie, even a low priced used version.

I'm glad I took the chance.  Yes, there are definite issues with the script...the screen writer is either under 35 or has perfectly captured the self-abosrbed, we're-all-reality-stars mentality of that generation, which the characters so perfectly exhibit...they move too slowly to really be at work, they react too slowly to anything outside of their ""normal"", they spend too much time on their own peculiar angst about relationships, friendships, know-it-all-ness, etc.  YET-based on my own experiences in the real world, this is the real way people that age act...and thus, it works.
