As in my other reviews for the Wiggles DVDs, the live action does not capture the attention of my 16 month olds as much as the earlier DVDs do (Yummy Yummy, Wiggle Time, Toot Toot) ones do. My kids do not have a problem with any of the new Wiggles (like Sam,Emma, Lachy, or Simon), but the sets aren't as colorful and part of the magic of the Wiggles is gone when they do the live shows (my boys like the close ups of their faces, the cheap but vibrant backgrounds, the simple songs and motions, and they don't pay attention to the transition/talking segments in this DVD.) As and adult, I did enjoy the bloopers they cut in. We purchased this DVD though because we are pretty much going to have every Wiggle DVD whether they are good or bad. I rated this three stars not because I felt it was an average DVD, but because the live shows are just not for my kids at this stage.",3,Get this if you are collecting all the Wiggles DVDs,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,914,"['Most', 'DVD', 'live', 'show', 'other', 'reviews', 'Wiggles', 'DVDs', 'live', 'action', 'not', 'capture', 'attention', '16', 'month', 'olds', 'as', 'much', 'earlier', 'DVDs', 'do', 'Yummy', 'Yummy', 'Wiggle', 'Time', 'Toot', 'Toot', 'ones', 'do', 'My', 'kids', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'new', 'Wiggles', 'Sam', 'Emma', 'Lachy', 'Simon', 'sets', 'are', ""n't"", 'colorful', 'part', 'magic', 'Wiggles', 'gone', 'when', 'do', 'live', 'shows', 'boys', 'close', 'ups', 'cheap', 'vibrant', 'backgrounds', 'simple', 'songs', 'motions', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'transition/talking', 'segments', 'DVD', 'adult', 'did', 'enjoy', 'bloopers', 'cut', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'going', 'have', 'Wiggle', 'DVD', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'rated', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'felt', 'was', 'average', 'DVD', 'live', 'shows', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'kids', 'stage']",Wiggles: Big Birthday

It's kind of a patchwork DVD, with 2/3 of it being a live concert performance, which my 2 year-old is not overly interested in, without the fun effects and music and camera angles of the traditional Wiggles DVDs. The rest is comprised of short 1-or-2 minute skits, which are fun but too short, and general things like bloopers. All fine, if not terribly polished, but, again...I can't say my toddler is as enraptured with it as he is with the other Wiggles material. We still love the Wiggles around here, but if I were you I'd grab another of their DVDs.DECEMBER 2012 POSTSCRIPT: I was totally wrong. My toddler loves this DVD, so I've made it a five-star review. The fact that the program is kind of haphazard turns out to be a plus, what with the whole short attention span thing. He is enthralled every time he watches. So I will amend my earlier statement and say DO buy this DVD, you'll be glad you did. And the accompanying documentary about the history of the Wiggles is very interesting, too, but not for the kids. I don't mean there's anything they shouldn't see, it's just not very interesting for little ones.",5,Beware......................,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,1214,"['guess', 'know', 'what', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'kind', 'patchwork', 'DVD', '2/3', 'being', 'live', 'concert', 'performance', '2', 'year-old', 'not', 'overly', 'interested', 'fun', 'effects', 'music', 'camera', 'angles', 'traditional', 'Wiggles', 'DVDs', 'rest', 'comprised', 'short', '1-or-2', 'minute', 'skits', 'are', 'fun', 'too', 'short', 'general', 'things', 'bloopers', 'fine', 'not', 'terribly', 'polished', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'toddler', 'enraptured', 'other', 'Wiggles', 'material', 'still', 'love', 'Wiggles', 'here', 'were', ""'d"", 'grab', 'DVDs.DECEMBER', '2012', 'POSTSCRIPT', 'was', 'totally', 'wrong', 'toddler', 'DVD', 'so', ""'ve"", 'made', 'five-star', 'review', 'fact', 'program', 'kind', 'haphazard', 'out', 'be', 'plus', 'what', 'whole', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'thing', 'enthralled', 'time', 'will', 'amend', 'earlier', 'statement', 'say', 'DO', 'buy', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'accompanying', 'documentary', 'history', 'Wiggles', 'very', 'interesting', 'too', 'not', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'little', 'ones']",Wiggles: Big Birthday
