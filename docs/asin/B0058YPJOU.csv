""The Mentalist"" has thrived for three seasons as a clever police procedural built around Jane's uncanny ability to read and manipulate people (including, sometimes, his own teammates).As the fourth season opens, the team is in deep trouble.  Patrick Jane is on trial for murder, for having shot a man he believed to be the infamous serial killer Red John, murderer of Jane's own wife and child.  Lisbon is on suspension for failing to manage Jane, while her team has been scattered.  Patrick Jane has a lot of work to do.  He needs to somehow survive a trial, then regain the trust of a new CBI boss and resurrect his old team.The interpersonal dynamics of the team continue to be interesting and entertaining, and will be affected by Lisbon's new supervisor, a man with an agenda.  Under duress, Lisbon and Jane will become much more frank with each other about a great many things.  Lisbon and the team will have to deal with an angry and edgy Van Pelt, traumatized by the betrayal and death of her fiancee last season.  Cho and Rigsby will have the unique experience of watching Jane manipulate someone else's team and team leader, for a change, while dealing with their own entangling personal relationships outside the team.  And is it possible that Red John is still out there, still haunting Patrick Jane? And if he is, will there be another confrontation?""The Mentalist: The Complete Fourth Season"" is very highly recommended to its fans.",5,Mind Games...,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,1841,"['Mentalist', 'returns', 'fourth', 'season', 'CBS', 'starring', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'Patrick', 'Jane', 'former', 'psychic', 'medium', 'con', 'man', 'now', 'working', 'consultant', 'California', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'CBI', 'team', 'led', 'Senior', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Theresa', 'Lisbon', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'Special', 'Agents', 'Kimball', 'Cho', 'Tim', 'Kang', 'Wayne', 'Rigsby', 'Owain', 'Yeoman', 'Grace', 'Van', 'Pelt', 'Amanda', 'Righetti', 'Mentalist', 'thrived', 'three', 'seasons', 'clever', 'police', 'procedural', 'built', 'Jane', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'read', 'manipulate', 'people', 'including', 'sometimes', 'own', 'teammates', '.As', 'fourth', 'season', 'opens', 'team', 'deep', 'trouble', 'Patrick', 'Jane', 'trial', 'murder', 'having', 'man', 'believed', 'be', 'infamous', 'serial', 'killer', 'Red', 'John', 'murderer', 'Jane', 'own', 'wife', 'child', 'Lisbon', 'suspension', 'failing', 'manage', 'Jane', 'team', 'been', 'scattered', 'Patrick', 'Jane', 'lot', 'work', 'do', 'somehow', 'survive', 'trial', 'then', 'regain', 'trust', 'new', 'CBI', 'boss', 'resurrect', 'old', 'team.The', 'interpersonal', 'dynamics', 'team', 'continue', 'be', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'Lisbon', 'new', 'supervisor', 'man', 'agenda', 'duress', 'Lisbon', 'Jane', 'will', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'frank', 'other', 'great', 'many', 'things', 'Lisbon', 'team', 'will', 'have', 'deal', 'angry', 'edgy', 'Van', 'Pelt', 'traumatized', 'betrayal', 'death', 'fiancee', 'last', 'season', 'Cho', 'Rigsby', 'will', 'have', 'unique', 'experience', 'watching', 'Jane', 'manipulate', 'someone', 'else', 'team', 'team', 'leader', 'change', 'dealing', 'own', 'entangling', 'personal', 'relationships', 'team', 'possible', 'Red', 'John', 'still', 'there', 'still', 'haunting', 'Patrick', 'Jane', 'will', 'there', 'be', 'confrontation', 'Mentalist', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans']","Mentalist, The:S4 (DVD)"

Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes in modern garb with a twist, but it is so much more.THE MENTALIST, in fact, lays almost every icon and clich&eacute; of the whole mystery/crime genre on its ear, and, in some cases, goes them one better. Just one ""for instance"" will suffice (half the fun is searching out the others): there are two variations (so far) on MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. In addition, there are elements from many and diverse television dramas of the past, from THE FUGITIVE and PERRY MASON to STAR TREK. Yes, STAR TREK (Kimball Cho as Spock?).  Bruno Heller knows - as did Gene Roddenberry - that an audience needs a cast they can care about, which means a group of well developed characters who care about each other.I'm not sure Mr. Heller did all this on purpose, mind you, but the fact is that some of THE MENTALIST episodes - to say nothing of the seasons themselves - have as many layers and contain as many traditions as the HARRY POTTER novels, including Jane Austen's penchant for misdirection, but it is certainly great fun thinking along those lines whether or not.And really, what more can we ask.

Some of the subplots left as cliff hangers in season three have been settled and the series continues to make use of Simon Baker's terrific screen presence as Patrick Jane who is able to touch the untouchable aspects of people's minds in solving some very clever crimes.  Baker's ability to carry off this enigmatic role is what makes the show tick, but it is his faithful crew of detecting minds that make the series always watchable and enjoyable - Robin Tunney as Lisbon the boss, and her associates Tim Kang, Owain Yeoman, and Amanda Rigetti.  Some of the irony of Jane's abilities are growing a bit thin, but the scripts snap and the camaraderie that emanates from this group of detectives remains magical.  So far, no disappointments.

This is not to say that Simon Baker as Patrick Jane isn't as entertaining and charming as he always is, but there is a creeping darkness that mutes the fourth season. The character's are all well played by their respective actor's but some of the innovative plots which were so prevalent in the three previous seasons seem somehow contrived or borrowed from seasons 1-3. Too many of the killings take place in venues that have already been used. But, this season is not lacking in it's ability to draw you in. There are some encore appearances by Malcolm McDowell (Bret Stiles) and Morena Baccarin (Erica FLynn) which help with continuity and an episode, &#34;Ruby Slippers,&#34; deals honestly and compassionately with female impersonators. But, the big question is, did Jane really kill Red John at the end of season three? If he didn't how can it be kept a secret? And how about all those nosy FBI agents who still have a mole in the CBI?

At first, I doubted that the problem was with the discs, and began extensively testing other DVDs in my collection for comparative purposes.  I also tried a different DVD player just to rule out a hardware issue.  Finally, I went online and found other disc owners who described EXACTLY what I was seeing on my screen.  What I am seeing is an image that seems to go in and out of focus and often appears grainy and pixelated.  The characters faces often seem to show a ""mirage"" effect, something that is otherwise very difficult to describe.Is anyone else noticing this problem?  I've watched all five DVDs and the problem exists throughout the set.  I purchased my copy of season 4 through a legitimate US retailer and am convinced that my boxed set is authentic, not one of the many bootlegs sold on auction sites.  Nevertheless, I am at a loss as to why the picture quality with the DVDs is so poor.
