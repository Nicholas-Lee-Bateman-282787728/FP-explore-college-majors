Any fan of their movies like &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; and &quot;Treasure Island&quot; should enjoy this movie. Some great acting from James MacArthur, Christopher Plummer, and Peter O'Toole add to the believability we are in Scotland and living the adventure with them.A wonderful story of a Scottsman's adventure after his fathers death. An Uncle that does not wish to share his estate with his brothers son, has him kidnapped. Adventure on the high seas and land both make it an exceptional film. Some great fight and escape scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting, directing, scenery, and music make this Disney movie stand out as one of the best in their series of classic movies.I hope along with many of the other live action Disney movies that are coming out on DVD this will be put on DVD as well.

I was surprised at how accurate my memory was, everything was exactly as I fondly remembered it.  It starts as so many Disney films did with a recently orphaned young man (James MacArthur) out to claim his inheritance.  (Disney seemed to gravitate towards stories involving dead parents.  Kind of takes the `family' out of family entertainment.)  The plot is rich with scoundrels, villains, intrigue, a curse on the House of Shaws, a shipwreck, a murderous uncle (John Laurie as the aptly named Ebenezer Balfour), soldiers on the prowl, and yes, a kidnapping.  There's also a duel with bagpipes featuring Peter O'Toole (as Robin MacGregor).  Accents fly fast and furiously and MacArthur manages to maintain his throughout this film.  There's one troublesome death scene but it's done off camera.  The pace is quick, the story is handled in 95 minutes.  The acting is uniformly good.  It's a substantial adventure film that never really got its due (some critics condemned it as `dull').  I'm glad to have found it for my collection.

This was absolutely wonderful!About as un-Disney as you can get and still carry the brand name.First, it's spoken entirely in honest Scot and legit Gaelic. There's no 'Americanization' of the characters, so typical of Disney productions; converting a people and their heritage to be palatable for what was then its primary audience. In fact, as I think about it: From a business standpoint, why did they green-light this? It certainly didn't fit in their business model. Very interesting.Second, death is no boundary. It's depicted without mercy, nor pity - not hallowed or righteous - just the bitterness of killing. The murder of a young boy at the hands of a drunk sailor, whose body is then unceremoniously dumped overboard. Wow. That stark realism alone made this unusual, possibly even unique, as far as I know of Disney films for this period.Thirdly, we get an unromantic insight into the history of Scotland. Certainly the story of English conquerers and their conquests have been fair game in recent films. But the truth is, even without English interference, the Scots would've been at war with one another. They had battled with one another for centuries before England and continued after. Blood feuds were common and even glorified by both cultures; the enduring enmity between Highland and Lowland Scots has rarely been exposed so vividly as in 'Kidnapped'. Truly amazing.I'm genuinely stunned.The adventures of young David Balfour and his journey home to claim his birthright was truly enjoyable. After being tricked by a conniving uncle, young David has to survive being sold into indentured servitude in far away America, a hand-to-hand ship battle for his own freedom, and a terrifying shipwreck on the storm-riddled Scottish coast. Accompanied by Alan Breck Stuart of Clan Stuart, admirably played by Peter Finch, a soldier in the service of an outcast king. I've always appreciated him as an actor, but this incredible performance has elevated him in my eyes. I suspect few could have pulled off the hardened combat veteran who fears no man and bends knee to his King and his king alone.And you can't help but notice a small bit part played by a very young Peter O'Toole. Fans of the man tend to point to 'Arabia' as his defining role. And while I have respect and appreciation for that work, it's his smaller, less grand performances that I've always enjoyed best. This small role is one of those.A near five-star rating for me, save for the fact that the audio re-dub wasn't quite in synch and the stock print being washed out. But the story and the sincere performances of every actor involved is worth every penny.Repeat viewings may be necessary for those accustomed to subtitles, of which this bare bones edition has none.",4,Wonderfully Un-Disney-Like,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,2878,"['Went', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'yet', 'fluff', 'piece', 'classic', 'Disney', 'bit', 'harmless', 'fun', 'Wow', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'as', 'un-Disney', 'can', 'get', 'still', 'carry', 'brand', 'name.First', 'spoken', 'entirely', 'honest', 'Scot', 'legit', 'Gaelic', ""'Americanization"", 'characters', 'so', 'typical', 'Disney', 'productions', 'converting', 'people', 'heritage', 'be', 'palatable', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'primary', 'audience', 'fact', 'think', 'business', 'standpoint', 'why', 'did', 'green-light', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'business', 'model', 'Very', 'interesting.Second', 'death', 'boundary', 'depicted', 'mercy', 'pity', 'not', 'hallowed', 'righteous', 'just', 'bitterness', 'killing', 'murder', 'young', 'boy', 'hands', 'drunk', 'sailor', 'body', 'then', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'overboard', 'Wow', 'stark', 'realism', 'alone', 'made', 'unusual', 'possibly', 'even', 'unique', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'Disney', 'films', 'period.Thirdly', 'get', 'unromantic', 'insight', 'history', 'Scotland', 'Certainly', 'story', 'English', 'conquerers', 'conquests', 'have', 'been', 'fair', 'game', 'recent', 'films', 'truth', 'even', 'English', 'interference', 'Scots', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'war', 'one', 'had', 'battled', 'one', 'centuries', 'England', 'continued', 'Blood', 'feuds', 'were', 'common', 'even', 'glorified', 'cultures', 'enduring', 'enmity', 'Highland', 'Lowland', 'Scots', 'rarely', 'been', 'exposed', 'so', 'vividly', ""'Kidnapped"", 'Truly', 'amazing.I', ""'m"", 'genuinely', 'stunned.The', 'adventures', 'young', 'David', 'Balfour', 'journey', 'home', 'claim', 'birthright', 'was', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'being', 'tricked', 'conniving', 'uncle', 'young', 'David', 'survive', 'being', 'sold', 'indentured', 'servitude', 'far', 'away', 'America', 'hand-to-hand', 'ship', 'battle', 'own', 'freedom', 'terrifying', 'shipwreck', 'storm-riddled', 'Scottish', 'coast', 'Accompanied', 'Alan', 'Breck', 'Stuart', 'Clan', 'Stuart', 'admirably', 'played', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'soldier', 'service', 'outcast', 'king', ""'ve"", 'always', 'appreciated', 'actor', 'incredible', 'performance', 'elevated', 'eyes', 'suspect', 'few', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'hardened', 'combat', 'veteran', 'who', 'man', 'knee', 'King', 'king', 'alone.And', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'small', 'bit', 'part', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Fans', 'man', 'tend', 'point', ""'Arabia"", 'defining', 'role', 'have', 'respect', 'appreciation', 'work', 'smaller', 'less', 'grand', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'best', 'small', 'role', 'one', 'those.A', 'five-star', 'rating', 'save', 'fact', 'audio', 're-dub', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'synch', 'stock', 'print', 'being', 'washed', 'out', 'story', 'sincere', 'performances', 'actor', 'involved', 'worth', 'penny.Repeat', 'viewings', 'may', 'be', 'necessary', 'accustomed', 'subtitles', 'bare', 'edition', 'none']",Kidnapped VHS

This is a grittier more realistic film than Treasure Island, not as flamboyant. Coincidentally, Disney Director Robert Stevenson wrote the screenplay based on the novel but he is not related to the original writer.Set in 18th centurey Scotland, it features James MacArthur who made 5 other films for Disney as a young man, and later moved on to ""Hawaii 5-O"". The film starts with a plot of a young man finding out he has an estate after his father dies, and when he goes to reclaim it his uncle tries to cheat him out of it. There is a famous scene where the uncle tries to kill the young man by sending up a tower in the dark... with missing stairs. Peter Finch is the Hero that takes him under his wing. They have to battle their way off a ship as cutthroat sailors try to murder them. The movie draws you in, as it is very realistic and loaded with period atmosphere, costumes, sets, and weapons. The British are chasing the Scottish Highlanders all over the countryside which is loaded with friends and traitors, and so they can trust no one. There are many character actors that add to the richness of the film. This film is a rollicking good time, and has intrigue, adventure, and mystery as well. Swordfights and gun battles galore! There are numerous authentic Scottish actors and accents, as it was filmed on location in Scotland. While Disney films that were made in Europe were criticized for being ""too Americanized"" they loved this film and praised both it's authenticity to the original book.The color is beautiful on this nice clean print. This film is not for the smallest kids as it does have some scary scenes and some violence. (But keep in mind that the film still takes a strong stand against killing and drinking/gambling. Nice moral lessons without being preachy. The stars fight because they have too, and truly regret having to participate in violence to defend themselves).",5,Great adventure in the classic disney style,1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,2038,"['Originally', 'released', '1960', 'filmed', '10', 'years', 'Disney', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'are', 'based', 'books', 'written', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'grittier', 'more', 'realistic', 'film', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'not', 'flamboyant', 'Coincidentally', 'Disney', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Stevenson', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'novel', 'not', 'related', 'original', 'writer.Set', '18th', 'centurey', 'Scotland', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'who', 'made', '5', 'other', 'films', 'Disney', 'young', 'man', 'later', 'moved', 'Hawaii', '5-O', 'film', 'plot', 'young', 'man', 'finding', 'out', 'estate', 'father', 'dies', 'when', 'reclaim', 'uncle', 'tries', 'cheat', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'uncle', 'kill', 'young', 'man', 'sending', 'up', 'tower', 'dark', 'missing', 'stairs', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Hero', 'wing', 'have', 'battle', 'way', 'ship', 'cutthroat', 'sailors', 'try', 'murder', 'movie', 'draws', 'very', 'realistic', 'loaded', 'period', 'atmosphere', 'costumes', 'sets', 'weapons', 'British', 'are', 'chasing', 'Scottish', 'Highlanders', 'countryside', 'loaded', 'friends', 'traitors', 'so', 'can', 'trust', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'character', 'actors', 'add', 'richness', 'film', 'film', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'intrigue', 'adventure', 'mystery', 'as', 'well', 'Swordfights', 'gun', 'battles', 'galore', 'are', 'numerous', 'authentic', 'Scottish', 'actors', 'accents', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Scotland', 'Disney', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'Europe', 'were', 'criticized', 'being', 'too', 'Americanized', 'loved', 'film', 'praised', 'authenticity', 'original', 'book.The', 'color', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'clean', 'print', 'film', 'not', 'smallest', 'kids', 'have', 'scary', 'scenes', 'violence', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'still', 'strong', 'stand', 'killing', 'drinking/gambling', 'Nice', 'moral', 'lessons', 'being', 'preachy', 'stars', 'fight', 'have', 'too', 'truly', 'regret', 'having', 'participate', 'violence', 'defend']",Kidnapped VHS

Going to this movie in a full screen theatre was magical and it is still so with our large home flatscreen and sound system now.  It shares an engaging story from a time in history when Scotland was still not free.

At one point, for instance, a mean, drunk, incompetent sailor kills a 12 year old cabin boy for mocking him, and they throw the boy's body over the rail to avoid being caught.  When did you see a Disney movie like that?",5,Superb!
