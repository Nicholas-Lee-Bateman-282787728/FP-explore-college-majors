1347358,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B003JCUGYQ,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[14, 16]","1963's ""Tarzan's Three Challenges"" is, by far, the best 'Tarzan' film of Jock Mahoney, exciting, colorful, and very entertaining...but the production, filmed in Thailand, also resulted in Mahoney contracting amoebic dysentery, dengue fever, and pneumonia, losing nearly 45 pounds during production, and requiring nearly two years to recover! It would, needless to say, be his last screen appearance as Tarzan...Directed by Robert Day (who'd helmed 1960's ""Tarzan the Magnificent"", with Mahoney as the villain), the film balances producer Sy Weintraub's desire for an 'up-to-date' Tarzan (parachuting into the country), with a timeless, classic plot (in a mythic, Tibet-like realm, Tarzan must protect the child successor to the throne until his ordination, while the dead king's brother schemes to kill the child and take the throne for himself, and later, his son). Woody Strode, complete with slanted eyes, a dubbed voice, and a Herculean physique, is perfect in the villainous role, both commanding and impulsive.The 'Three Challenges' of the title actually appear quite early in the film, as Tarzan is tested to determine his worthiness to protect the boy king. The challenges provides the film's iconic image, as Tarzan, in one test, must withstand two buffaloes attempting to pull him apart, for five gongs. Obviously filmed early into the production, Mahoney looks spectacular, his trim muscles strained to the limit!While illness took an obvious toll during the filming (Mahoney became tired and worn, looking increasingly emaciated), he still performed his own stunts, and 'carried his load', earning the respect of the cast and crew. His climactic fight with Strode still packs a wallop, despite the differences in their physical condition. It's a very well-staged sword fight, and a high point in the film.Despite a very short tenure as Tarzan, Jock Mahoney was quite good, and ""Tarzan's Three Challenges"" is definitely worth owning!",5,Best...and Worst...Mahoney Tarzan Experience!,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,1944,"['1963', 'Tarzan', 'Three', 'Challenges', 'far', 'best', ""'Tarzan"", 'film', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'exciting', 'colorful', 'very', 'entertaining', 'production', 'filmed', 'Thailand', 'also', 'resulted', 'Mahoney', 'contracting', 'amoebic', 'dysentery', 'dengue', 'fever', 'pneumonia', 'losing', 'nearly', '45', 'pounds', 'production', 'requiring', 'nearly', 'two', 'years', 'recover', 'would', 'needless', 'say', 'be', 'last', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Tarzan', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Day', 'who', ""'d"", 'helmed', '1960', 'Tarzan', 'Magnificent', 'Mahoney', 'villain', 'film', 'balances', 'producer', 'Sy', 'Weintraub', 'desire', ""'up-to-date"", 'Tarzan', 'parachuting', 'country', 'timeless', 'classic', 'plot', 'mythic', 'Tibet-like', 'realm', 'Tarzan', 'must', 'protect', 'child', 'successor', 'throne', 'ordination', 'dead', 'king', 'brother', 'kill', 'child', 'take', 'throne', 'later', 'son', 'Woody', 'Strode', 'complete', 'slanted', 'eyes', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'Herculean', 'physique', 'perfect', 'villainous', 'role', 'commanding', 'impulsive.The', ""'Three"", 'Challenges', 'title', 'actually', 'appear', 'quite', 'early', 'film', 'Tarzan', 'tested', 'determine', 'worthiness', 'protect', 'boy', 'king', 'challenges', 'film', 'iconic', 'image', 'Tarzan', 'one', 'test', 'must', 'withstand', 'two', 'buffaloes', 'attempting', 'pull', 'apart', 'five', 'gongs', 'Obviously', 'filmed', 'early', 'production', 'Mahoney', 'spectacular', 'trim', 'muscles', 'strained', 'limit', 'illness', 'took', 'obvious', 'toll', 'filming', 'Mahoney', 'became', 'tired', 'worn', 'looking', 'increasingly', 'emaciated', 'still', 'performed', 'own', 'stunts', ""'carried"", 'load', 'earning', 'respect', 'cast', 'crew', 'climactic', 'fight', 'Strode', 'still', 'wallop', 'differences', 'physical', 'condition', 'very', 'well-staged', 'sword', 'fight', 'high', 'point', 'film.Despite', 'very', 'short', 'tenure', 'Tarzan', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Tarzan', 'Three', 'Challenges', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A

1347360,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B003JCUGYQ,Israel Drazin,"[6, 6]","This 92 minute 1963 Tarzan movie stars 44 year old Jock Mahoney, the oldest actor to play the part of the African strongman. It is the second and the last Tarzan film that Mahoney will make. Rather than transpiring in Africa, the action takes place in Thailand. Tarzan has been summoned to Thailand to help a dying king who wants Tarzan to protect his son who he wants to succeed him. The king's son is being threatened by his uncle, the king's brother, who is determined to assume the throne at any cost. Before being allowed to protect the youngster, Tarzan needs to perform three tests which show that he is strong, adept at using weapons, and smart enough to protect the boy. Tarzan goes through many difficulties to bring the son to the royal palace. Once there, the boy also needs to pass tests, but these require magical intuition.The story line is more complex and interesting than most Tarzan films, and has better acting. There is more drama and the events that occur are not the same well-worn happenings from prior Tarzan films that are repackaged. There is no Tarzan yell, or Jane or Boy causing Tarzan to stumble into trouble against his better judgment, as usually happens in this genre, or elephants rushing pell mell with determined faces, reassuring grunts, and trampling feet to save him. Mischevious Chetta is absent and an adorable, loving baby elephant takes its place and offers humorous interludes accompanied by happy and playful background music. There is, of course, no great depth to the plot line, but none is expected in Tarzan films, which are simply enjoyable adventure tales. Mahoney plays a Tarzan who speaks perfect English.

1347366,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B003JCUGYQ,The Mysterious Traveler,"[1, 1]","TARZAN'S THREE CHALLENGES(1963) Directed and Written by Robert Day.Starring Jock Mahoney, George Pastell(as the voice of Khan) and Woody Strode.Tarzan is summoned to Thailand---or rather the location is Thailand while the culture depicted is Tibetan---to escort--and protect---the Chosen One---a child chosen by the gods to become the leader of the country upon the forthcoming death of the present monarch..However the current ruler's brother Khan covets the throne for himself for reasons incidentally that make perfect sense and attempts to slay the child before he can take his place upon the throne. Failing that, Khan makes use of a thousand year old custom challenging the child...........or his defender aka Tarzan.....to a terrible struggle to the death upon a net beneath which are vats of boiling something or other.The fourth of the revamped Tarzan series in which he is portrayed as Rice Burroughs intended......intelligent and eloquent-----though oddly enough lacking the savagery that the print character had and that Weissmuller, Merrill and Scott brought to the part. Apparently filmmakers had difficulty with combining the two traits effectively. The second film with Mahoney as Tarzan and who, while not upper tier, is credible. If nothing else, the actor---Sally Field's stepfather incidentally---was determined as, during filming, he was suffering from dysentry, dengue fever and pneumonia and yet, except during the running sequence during the end where he looks far more exhausted and spent than Tarzan should, he hardly looks ill at all.The film should be a great moment for Woody Strode fans---that great Black actor from the 50s and 60s who is consistently ignored because he was a conservative. He gets to play two parts---the current dying king and his villainous brother Khan......the later of which is a highly credible opponent for the Ape Man. Always a rare thing. However the filmmakers made the HIGHLY dubious choice of dubbing Strode with George (Hammer's THE MUMMY) Pastell's voice. Not only is it HIGHLY distracting since this viewer spent about 45 minutes trying to recognize that familiar voice but there was no reason for it. The star of such things as SPARTACUS and THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, Strode was a highly accomplished actor and perfectly capable of speaking thank you very much. It really is an unnecessary annoyance and Strode deserved better.Also it must be said that Day was simply not all that good a director and is weak as a writer. Where John Guilerman directed the hell out of TARZAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE and gave his characters excellent subtle and surprising characterzations and developments, Day tends to keep that camera still usually opting always for the far shot with nary a closeup. His editing is lanquid letting scenes run on too long. And his script---while excellent in basic plot is usually underdeveloped in detail. Characters have little exchanges or speeches that are never expanded upon or are not set up resulting in their lacking any dramatic impact. It is like Day is trying to immitate Guilerman but does not know how.The film also does not make any real use of the Asian jungles that Tarzan leads his little group through in regards to the unigue dangers there as oppossed to Africa. The film is at its most interesting--especially during its last quarter when it deals with the exotic customs and ornate temples of this far off locale. There is that lost city feel that Tarzan functions well in and there is a lowkey supernatural subtext to the proceedings. The film at that point also attains an almost epic scope and is visually quite arresting.Not brilliant. Not boring. Violent. The final battle with Strode is notable.A solid though lower tier Tarzan film.",3,This film overcomes its challenges.........barely,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,3749,"['TARZAN', 'THREE', 'CHALLENGES', '1963', 'Directed', 'Written', 'Robert', 'Day.Starring', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'George', 'Pastell', 'voice', 'Khan', 'Woody', 'Strode.Tarzan', 'summoned', 'Thailand', '-or', 'rather', 'location', 'Thailand', 'culture', 'depicted', 'Tibetan', '-to', 'escort', 'protect', '-the', 'Chosen', 'One', '-a', 'child', 'chosen', 'gods', 'become', 'leader', 'country', 'forthcoming', 'death', 'present', 'current', 'ruler', 'brother', 'Khan', 'throne', 'reasons', 'incidentally', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'attempts', 'slay', 'child', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'throne', 'Failing', 'Khan', 'use', 'thousand', 'year', 'old', 'custom', 'challenging', 'child', '..or', 'defender', 'aka', 'Tarzan', 'terrible', 'struggle', 'death', 'net', 'beneath', 'are', 'vats', 'boiling', 'something', 'other.The', 'fourth', 'revamped', 'Tarzan', 'series', 'portrayed', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'intended', 'intelligent', 'eloquent', 'oddly', 'enough', 'lacking', 'savagery', 'print', 'character', 'had', 'Weissmuller', 'Merrill', 'Scott', 'brought', 'part', 'Apparently', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'difficulty', 'combining', 'two', 'traits', 'effectively', 'second', 'film', 'Mahoney', 'Tarzan', 'who', 'not', 'upper', 'tier', 'credible', 'nothing', 'else', 'actor', '-Sally', 'Field', 'stepfather', 'incidentally', '-was', 'determined', 'filming', 'was', 'suffering', 'dysentry', 'dengue', 'fever', 'pneumonia', 'yet', 'running', 'sequence', 'end', 'where', 'far', 'more', 'exhausted', 'spent', 'Tarzan', 'should', 'hardly', 'ill', 'all.The', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'moment', 'Woody', 'Strode', 'fans', '-that', 'great', 'Black', 'actor', '50s', '60s', 'who', 'consistently', 'ignored', 'was', 'conservative', 'play', 'two', 'parts', '-the', 'current', 'dying', 'king', 'villainous', 'brother', 'Khan', 'later', 'highly', 'credible', 'opponent', 'Ape', 'Man', 'rare', 'thing', 'However', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'HIGHLY', 'dubious', 'choice', 'dubbing', 'Strode', 'George', 'Hammer', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'Pastell', 'voice', 'Not', 'only', 'HIGHLY', 'distracting', 'viewer', 'spent', '45', 'minutes', 'trying', 'recognize', 'familiar', 'voice', 'was', 'reason', 'star', 'such', 'things', 'SPARTACUS', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'SHOT', 'LIBERTY', 'VALANCE', 'Strode', 'was', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'speaking', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'annoyance', 'Strode', 'deserved', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'Day', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'director', 'weak', 'writer', 'Where', 'John', 'Guilerman', 'directed', 'hell', 'TARZAN', 'GREATEST', 'ADVENTURE', 'gave', 'characters', 'excellent', 'subtle', 'surprising', 'characterzations', 'developments', 'Day', 'keep', 'camera', 'still', 'usually', 'opting', 'always', 'far', 'shot', 'closeup', 'editing', 'lanquid', 'letting', 'scenes', 'run', 'too', 'long', 'script', '-while', 'excellent', 'basic', 'plot', 'usually', 'underdeveloped', 'detail', 'Characters', 'have', 'little', 'exchanges', 'speeches', 'are', 'never', 'expanded', 'upon', 'are', 'not', 'set', 'up', 'resulting', 'lacking', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'like', 'Day', 'trying', 'immitate', 'Guilerman', 'not', 'know', 'how.The', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'make', 'real', 'use', 'Asian', 'jungles', 'Tarzan', 'little', 'group', 'regards', 'unigue', 'dangers', 'there', 'oppossed', 'Africa', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'especially', 'last', 'quarter', 'when', 'exotic', 'customs', 'ornate', 'temples', 'far', 'off', 'locale', 'lost', 'city', 'feel', 'Tarzan', 'functions', 'well', 'lowkey', 'supernatural', 'subtext', 'proceedings', 'film', 'point', 'also', 'almost', 'epic', 'scope', 'visually', 'quite', 'arresting.Not', 'brilliant', 'Not', 'boring', 'Violent', 'final', 'battle', 'Strode', 'notable.A', 'solid', 'lower', 'tier', 'Tarzan', 'film']",N/A
