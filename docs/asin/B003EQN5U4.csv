But what you don't know is whether this set is worth buying.  I can emphatically say it is.  It has what I consider the best two seasons to date.  That would be Season 6 and 8.  Both have some excellent action sequences coupled with some of the funniest comedy you'll see anywhere.  I will say that season 7 is odd to watch back to back.  On the net, it seemed like it took forever.  On the dvd, it seems to unfold in no time, doesn't really go anywhere, and leaves you wondering why it wasn't split between the season 6 and 8.  But it still culminates into a pretty awesome climax. ""Say hello to my laser face!!!""  Sorry, hope that didn't spoil anything for anyone.  All I can say is if you don't already own Season 6 and 7 pick this set up as it seems very well priced.  If you do, you might do better with just the single of Season 8.  But if you can't afford the box set, at least pick up Season 6 and 8. Man, I can't wait for seasons 9, 10, and 11!

1338070,A19MLRME6H8MTW,B003EQN5U4,"Forrest Bezotte ""Amazon fan""","[1, 1]","Since this box set contains seasons 6-8, I will separate my review into several parts that is dedicated to each season.S6Season 6: Reconstruction is a wonderful, dark start to the story, making you rethink your opinion of everything that happened in the first five seasons.  Washington is a great character, and one of the most complex, and I find the transmission messages in between the Director and the Chairman of Project Freelancer a really cool start to each episode.  Slowly, they reveal the personality and character traits of the faceless Director and the Chairman.  Though we partially see the Director's face in Season 9, I thought THIS introduction to the character was very amusing.Our thoughts on the character Church totally changes in this season, revealing something very crucial about him that I will not reveal in this review for any of you who have not seen this yet.  The plot twists are intriguing, engaging, and really, really rocks your world.  Another favorite character of mine is the AI Delta who happens to be based on the Mark V(?) armor from Combat Evolved even though most of this trilogy is set in the Halo 3 engine, making him a very unique and different character from the rest.As far as humor goes, I have to say this is one of the least funniest seasons in RvB, though Caboose is as funny as ever, and his comic remarks or incidents really lighten the mood a bit considering the serious, heavy plot we have here.  I give this season 4/5 starsS7Season 7: Recreation is a different matter entirely compared to seasons 6 and 8.  This season does contain a few mysterious, heavy moments but most of it has a lot of lighter moments that don't quite fit the story and the pace is bad too.  This season is the reason why this review has four stars instead of five.  The humor isn't as funny either, however, there IS a good plot twist in this season.  There's really not much to say about this season though, because like I said, the pace is pretty bad.S8Now HERE's a season worth getting its attention.  Not only are there twists, there is some very good action far beyond the scaled of the previous seasons, although Season 9 gets a little more credit for the action than this season, although THIS season has action in it that gives you that sense of emotion for the characters.  It's very cool to watch these characters go through these events that, while they don't make much sense, it is very character-driven.  We get a lot out of characters like Sarge, Church, Washington, and Tex (oops, did I say Tex?  Guess you'll have to see what I mean!).  The finale exceeded my expectations for anything I have ever seen in entertainment.  So make Sarge proud and watch these, I think they're really worth watching.",4,The best Red vs Blue collection yet,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,2742,"['box', 'set', 'contains', 'seasons', '6-8', 'will', 'separate', 'review', 'several', 'parts', 'dedicated', 'season.S6Season', '6', 'Reconstruction', 'wonderful', 'dark', 'start', 'story', 'making', 'rethink', 'opinion', 'everything', 'happened', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'Washington', 'great', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'find', 'transmission', 'messages', 'Director', 'Chairman', 'Project', 'Freelancer', 'really', 'cool', 'start', 'episode', 'Slowly', 'reveal', 'personality', 'character', 'traits', 'faceless', 'Director', 'Chairman', 'partially', 'see', 'Director', 'face', 'Season', '9', 'thought', 'THIS', 'introduction', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'amusing.Our', 'thoughts', 'character', 'Church', 'totally', 'season', 'revealing', 'something', 'very', 'crucial', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'intriguing', 'engaging', 'really', 'really', 'rocks', 'world', 'favorite', 'character', 'mine', 'AI', 'Delta', 'who', 'be', 'based', 'Mark', 'V', 'armor', 'Combat', 'Evolved', 'even', 'most', 'trilogy', 'set', 'Halo', '3', 'engine', 'making', 'very', 'unique', 'different', 'character', 'rest.As', 'far', 'humor', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'least', 'funniest', 'seasons', 'RvB', 'Caboose', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'comic', 'remarks', 'incidents', 'really', 'lighten', 'mood', 'bit', 'considering', 'serious', 'heavy', 'plot', 'have', 'here', 'give', 'season', '4/5', 'starsS7Season', '7', 'Recreation', 'different', 'matter', 'entirely', 'compared', 'seasons', '6', '8', 'season', 'contain', 'few', 'mysterious', 'heavy', 'moments', 'most', 'lot', 'lighter', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'story', 'pace', 'bad', 'too', 'season', 'reason', 'why', 'review', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'humor', ""n't"", 'funny', 'however', 'good', 'plot', 'twist', 'season', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'season', 'said', 'pace', 'pretty', 'bad.S8Now', 'HERE', 'season', 'getting', 'attention', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'twists', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'far', 'scaled', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Season', '9', 'little', 'more', 'credit', 'action', 'season', 'THIS', 'season', 'action', 'sense', 'emotion', 'characters', 'very', 'cool', 'watch', 'characters', 'go', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'very', 'character-driven', 'get', 'lot', 'characters', 'Sarge', 'Church', 'Washington', 'Tex', 'oops', 'did', 'say', 'Tex', 'Guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'finale', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'entertainment', 'So', 'make', 'Sarge', 'proud', 'watch', 'think', ""'re"", 'really', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Just look at early season 1 at the official site and be amazed at how far this show has really come.  Seasons 6-8 give conclusion to the comedy of Red team and Blue team  by throwing in action, adventure and a multitude of settings.  While some seem to dis-like the change I welcome it.  The comedy and old school RvB is there just upgraded like Simmons 2.0 .  With the added ability to essentially use rag doll to create their own scenes the RvB team created an action packed story full of special effects and awe-inspiring feats.Who am I kidding?  If you are looking at this you probably already have watched Red vs Blue or heard about it.  Or going to look up a sample video online to see what it looks like.  $20(what I paid for it) is a fantastic price.  The movies err.. seasons  clock in at around 100 minutes each (1hr 40mins).

1338079,A2U7ECPSKWG1SA,B003EQN5U4,"Neverwinter ""Kat D""","[0, 0]","The post-Blood Gulch seasons were not what I was expecting; they have a very different feel, slightly different mood, and season 6 (Reconstruction) is particularly dry (most of the time) regarding humor, but still has its moments and covers A LOT of story. The last few words in the last moment of that season CHANGED EVERYTHING (even if you had it figured out, it was DEVASTATINGLY SIGNIFICANT to hear it out loud!) and I was salivating for more!Seasons 6-8 take all the threads that have been established in Blood Gulch and weave them into a delicious, more mature story and as it unfolds not only did I find it fascinating, but when I re-watch the original 5 seasons I see the significance of everything Burnie Burns laid down as the project expanded past the initial target of 6 episodes.I was determined to write a review without spoilers, and I think I can tell you this without telling you too much: The Recollection seasons leave behind a great deal of the boys-will-be-boys levity of Blood Gulch, and trade it for a very developed, rewarding, addictive, fleshed-out story. The HUMOR is still there and the characters are STILL the dudes we know & love(!), but being faced with the reality of the past and how they fit into the whole picture forces these characters to grow up a bit.So if you have a Peter Pan complex about RvB & don't want ANYTHING to POSSIBLY change your perception of Blood Gulch (like not wanting to go back to your old summer camp and realize you were actually living in highly unsanitary conditions for weeks on end), you may not be ready for these seasons yet. But if you're ready to see how deep the story goes, go to some new places, meet some really bada** characters & see some REALLY COOL (like what Freelancers can REALLY DO in a fight), get ready for a REALLY GOOD TIME!",5,"It's not what I was expecting, it was better!",1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,1809,"['post-Blood', 'Gulch', 'seasons', 'were', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'feel', 'slightly', 'different', 'mood', 'season', '6', 'Reconstruction', 'particularly', 'dry', 'most', 'time', 'regarding', 'humor', 'still', 'moments', 'LOT', 'story', 'last', 'few', 'words', 'last', 'moment', 'season', 'CHANGED', 'EVERYTHING', 'even', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'DEVASTATINGLY', 'SIGNIFICANT', 'hear', 'out', 'loud', 'was', 'salivating', 'more', 'Seasons', '6-8', 'take', 'threads', 'have', 'been', 'established', 'Blood', 'Gulch', 'weave', 'delicious', 'more', 'mature', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'find', 'fascinating', 'when', 're-watch', 'original', '5', 'seasons', 'see', 'significance', 'everything', 'Burnie', 'Burns', 'laid', 'down', 'project', 'expanded', 'initial', 'target', '6', 'episodes.I', 'was', 'determined', 'write', 'review', 'spoilers', 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'telling', 'too', 'much', 'Recollection', 'seasons', 'leave', 'great', 'deal', 'boys-will-be-boys', 'levity', 'Blood', 'Gulch', 'trade', 'very', 'developed', 'rewarding', 'addictive', 'fleshed-out', 'story', 'HUMOR', 'still', 'characters', 'are', 'STILL', 'dudes', 'know', 'love', 'being', 'faced', 'reality', 'past', 'how', 'fit', 'whole', 'picture', 'characters', 'grow', 'up', 'bit.So', 'have', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'complex', 'RvB', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ANYTHING', 'POSSIBLY', 'change', 'perception', 'Blood', 'Gulch', 'not', 'wanting', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'summer', 'camp', 'realize', 'were', 'actually', 'living', 'highly', 'unsanitary', 'conditions', 'weeks', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ready', 'seasons', 'yet', ""'re"", 'ready', 'see', 'how', 'deep', 'story', 'go', 'new', 'places', 'meet', 'really', 'bada**', 'characters', 'see', 'REALLY', 'COOL', 'what', 'Freelancers', 'can', 'REALLY', 'DO', 'fight', 'get', 'ready', 'REALLY', 'GOOD', 'TIME']",N/A
