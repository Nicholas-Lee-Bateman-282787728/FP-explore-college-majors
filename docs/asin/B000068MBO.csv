It has been two loooooooooong years of this.Anyway, her older brother got really into this DVD (after getting over being terrified by it himself), which was of course way too scary for her.  But now that she is recently starting to get past these fears, she can't get enough of this video.  She giggles and laughs at parts of it.  Frankly, I think she is a still little afraid of this video, but she gets the same thrill out of watching it that people get out of watching Friday the 13th.  It's fun to be a little scared.  However, had she watched this before she was ready for it I'm sure it would have terrified her, so I think it is really all about timing and individual temperament.By the way, I see some of the prices people are trying to sell this for and I, personally, wouldn't exactly consider it to be a $57.31 value of a movie.  Anyway, I would at least check the local library first.  There are so many children's programs geared toward the topic of scary things and they all do the same thing -- show something scary and then reveal something safe and mundane behind it. I think kids are fascinated by these types of programs in general because they help them master their fears.",4,Helped my 3-1/2 year old work through fears,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,1300,"['daughter', 'been', 'afraid', 'ghosts', 'monsters', 'dark', 'name', 'was', 'two', 'been', 'two', 'loooooooooong', 'years', 'this.Anyway', 'older', 'brother', 'got', 'really', 'DVD', 'getting', 'being', 'terrified', 'was', 'course', 'way', 'too', 'scary', 'now', 'recently', 'starting', 'get', 'fears', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'video', 'parts', 'Frankly', 'think', 'still', 'little', 'afraid', 'video', 'same', 'thrill', 'watching', 'people', 'get', 'watching', 'Friday', '13th', 'fun', 'be', 'little', 'scared', 'However', 'had', 'watched', 'was', 'ready', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'terrified', 'think', 'really', 'timing', 'individual', 'temperament.By', 'way', 'see', 'prices', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'sell', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'consider', 'be', '57.31', 'value', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'would', 'least', 'check', 'local', 'library', 'first', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'programs', 'geared', 'topic', 'scary', 'things', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'show', 'something', 'scary', 'then', 'reveal', 'something', 'safe', 'mundane', 'think', 'kids', 'are', 'fascinated', 'types', 'programs', 'general', 'help', 'master', 'fears']",Winnie the Pooh - Frankenpooh and Spookable Pooh

704869,AFW4SFEMS4AAA,B000068MBO,Jacquie74,"[0, 0]","Frankenpooh and Spookable Pooh are both collections of short stories or videos. These are typical Winnie-the -Pooh videos. The story is fun and silly. All the characters are included in the stories. These are both a great video to watch during the Halloween season with children or if your a lover of Winnie-the-Pooh on your own. But, these stories are best when shared with a loved one. The DVD opens with a child friendly menu with verbal directions, so once it is in the player, it's easy to choose if you want one or the other or both stories. Even though the stories have a Halloween theme, the stories may reassure younger child about Halloween. Like all Winnie-the-Pooh stories, there is a life lesson and a happy ending to the rouble the characters get in the tale.",5,Excellent Pooh Halloween,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,773,"['Frankenpooh', 'Spookable', 'Pooh', 'are', 'collections', 'short', 'stories', 'videos', 'are', 'typical', 'Winnie-the', '-Pooh', 'videos', 'story', 'fun', 'silly', 'characters', 'are', 'included', 'stories', 'are', 'great', 'video', 'watch', 'Halloween', 'season', 'children', 'lover', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'own', 'stories', 'are', 'best', 'when', 'shared', 'loved', 'one', 'DVD', 'child', 'friendly', 'menu', 'verbal', 'directions', 'so', 'player', 'easy', 'choose', 'want', 'one', 'other', 'stories', 'Even', 'stories', 'have', 'Halloween', 'theme', 'stories', 'may', 'reassure', 'younger', 'child', 'Halloween', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'stories', 'life', 'lesson', 'happy', 'ending', 'rouble', 'characters', 'get', 'tale']",Winnie the Pooh - Frankenpooh and Spookable Pooh

Its also Pooh, so its just plain fun to watch. Tigger is hilarious! The few things I was disappointed with were the length, around 60 minutes for both programs(5 shorts in total), and the box said 70, and it should have had ""Boo to You Too"" to make it even more 'halloweenish'.My favorite was ""Frankenpooh"", but it was only 5 minutes long! ""Things that go Piglet in the Night"" is about piglet being mistaken for a ghost, its very funny. In ""Pooh Moon"", the gang mistakes eachother for monsters (the GrabMe Gotchas!), also pretty funny. ""Knight to Remember"" had piglet imagining he is a knight and has to be brave and slay a dragon, its a cute story that kids will really enjoy! and ""Rock a Bye Pooh"" Piglet has a nightmare (not very scary) so won't fall asleep, its really sweet because Pooh, Rabbit and Tigger are really good friends and try to help Piglet get over his nightmare. Also the bonus features (a game and a fun sing along song) aren't really to do with this DVD, but with ""Boo To You Too"", which I think should have been included on the DVD to make it a complete Halloween collection.",4,Overall Good,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,1220,"['3', 'half', 'stars', 'good', 'stuff', 'nothing', 'really', 'scary', 'pretty', 'good', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'also', 'Pooh', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'watch', 'Tigger', 'hilarious', 'few', 'things', 'was', 'disappointed', 'were', 'length', '60', 'minutes', 'programs', '5', 'shorts', 'total', 'box', 'said', '70', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'Boo', 'Too', 'make', 'even', 'more', ""'halloweenish'.My"", 'favorite', 'was', 'Frankenpooh', 'was', 'only', '5', 'minutes', 'long', 'Things', 'go', 'Piglet', 'Night', 'piglet', 'being', 'mistaken', 'ghost', 'very', 'funny', 'Pooh', 'Moon', 'gang', 'eachother', 'monsters', 'GrabMe', 'Gotchas', 'also', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Knight', 'Remember', 'had', 'piglet', 'imagining', 'knight', 'be', 'brave', 'slay', 'dragon', 'cute', 'story', 'kids', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Rock', 'Bye', 'Pooh', 'Piglet', 'nightmare', 'not', 'very', 'scary', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fall', 'asleep', 'really', 'sweet', 'Pooh', 'Rabbit', 'Tigger', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'try', 'help', 'Piglet', 'get', 'nightmare', 'Also', 'bonus', 'features', 'game', 'fun', 'sing', 'along', 'song', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'DVD', 'Boo', 'Too', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'DVD', 'make', 'complete', 'Halloween', 'collection']",Winnie the Pooh - Frankenpooh and Spookable Pooh
