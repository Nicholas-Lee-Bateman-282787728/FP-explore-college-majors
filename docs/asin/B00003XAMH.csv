It's almost like being part of making the album. If you ever wondered what the origional title of &quot;I Missed Again&quot;  was, you will get a chance to hear a bit of the origional demo tapes. If  you want to hear &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; being played backwards on a track  of &quot;Tommorow Never Knows&quot; this is it! There is so much detail!  Hugh Padgham, the Engineer, sits with Phil and plays back individual tracks  from the original tapes...and they explain how it was done. Includes guitar  by Eric Clapton and strings by Ravi Shankar!  It even has a previously  unrelaesed full length music video of &quot;If Leaving Me is Easy&quot; as  well as  a clip of Phil at the piano doing &quot;Plaese Don't  Ask&quot;...so emotional he almost cries! If you want the standard music  videos watch VH1.

But for those acts then, some of them were just trying to fall upon their footing. Phil Collins was definitely one of those acts. Since his career on his own, and with Genesis Phil Collins has continued to thrive with his guilty pleasure fields of pop. But when his solo debut Face Value his the music industry, Phil really showed his footing as a giant and a real go-getter out of his shadow. This story really reflects on how deep the album turned out to be.Classic Albums: Phil Collins Face Value, is a detailed and driven documentary that reflects on Phil's beginnings to what would be a legendary solo career. The stories behind Phil's crossroads within his ending first marriage, and how he transformed into his own, and aay fro beng a stepping stone from his era with Genesis as a lead singer. The movements are shown well here from each story behind songs like I Missed Again, the haunting In The Air Tonight, Phil's breakthrough smash, which was recently covered for the movie Miami Vice, and other great songs like This Must Be Love and Droned. There are also gripping interviews from Hugh Pagham, and from Phil himself on a landmark album that he made well.All in all, I just absolutely wish that there could've been other records of Phil's that were highlighted like No Jacket Required and But Seriously. Nevertheless, it is just the absolutely great documentary, and a great buy for die hard Phil Collins fans. I loved watching this documentary on VH1 classic recently, and it is a really great buy.Documetary: B+Extras: BPrice: BOverall: B 1/2+",4,Serious Shadow,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,1707,"['days', 'music', 'industry', 'really', '1980', 'see', 'how', 'wel', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'act', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Madonna', 'acts', 'then', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'fall', 'footing', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'acts', 'career', 'own', 'Genesis', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'continued', 'thrive', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'fields', 'pop', 'when', 'solo', 'debut', 'Face', 'Value', 'music', 'industry', 'Phil', 'really', 'showed', 'footing', 'giant', 'real', 'go-getter', 'shadow', 'story', 'really', 'how', 'deep', 'album', 'turned', 'out', 'be.Classic', 'Albums', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'Face', 'Value', 'detailed', 'driven', 'documentary', 'Phil', 'beginnings', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'legendary', 'solo', 'career', 'stories', 'Phil', 'crossroads', 'ending', 'first', 'marriage', 'how', 'transformed', 'own', 'aay', 'fro', 'beng', 'stepping', 'stone', 'era', 'Genesis', 'lead', 'singer', 'movements', 'are', 'shown', 'well', 'here', 'story', 'songs', 'Missed', 'Again', 'haunting', 'Air', 'Tonight', 'Phil', 'breakthrough', 'smash', 'was', 'recently', 'covered', 'movie', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'other', 'great', 'songs', 'Must', 'Be', 'Love', 'Droned', 'are', 'also', 'gripping', 'interviews', 'Hugh', 'Pagham', 'Phil', 'landmark', 'album', 'made', 'well.All', 'just', 'absolutely', 'wish', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'other', 'records', 'Phil', 'were', 'highlighted', 'Jacket', 'Required', 'Seriously', 'Nevertheless', 'just', 'absolutely', 'great', 'documentary', 'great', 'buy', 'die', 'hard', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'fans', 'loved', 'watching', 'documentary', 'VH1', 'classic', 'recently', 'really', 'great', 'buy.Documetary', 'B+Extras', 'BPrice', 'BOverall', '1/2+']",N/A

546826,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B00003XAMH,Missing Person,"[1, 1]","With its combination of deep emotions, eclecticism, & just-plain terrific songwriting, Phil Collins' 1981 debut solo album ""Face Value"" is one of the greatest albums of all time--in other words, it's certainly deserving of its place in the ""Classic Albums"" video/ DVD series.  For the most part, this is a priceless documentary that gives you a terrific look at the making of the ""Face Value"" album as well as some other goodies.  Phil, sometimes alone, and sometimes with assistant producer and engineer Hugh Padgham, dissects many of the songs from the album, and you get to hear some stuff that didn't end up on the album such as Eric Clapton's dobro playing on ""The Roof Is Leaking"" and Phil's early demo of ""I Missed Again"".  The DVD features interview segments with many of the people involved in making the album including Shankar (violinist), Louie Satterfield (trombonist), Tom Tom Washington (who arranged the horns), Arif Mardin (who did the string arrangement for ""If Leaving Me Is Easy""), and of course, Phil's long-time co-hort Daryl Stuermer; there's also Alphonso Johnson who discusses the sly bass guitar hook he came up with for ""This Must Be Love"".  In addition to this, there are also bits from Phil's manager Tony Smith, his Genesis bandmates Mike Rutherford & Tony Banks, the legendary co-founder of Atlantic Records Ahmet Ertegun, and former Virgin Records managing director Simon Draper.  Phil is in typically great form on this DVD, full of his usual wit and intelligence, and you get segments of him on the drums as well as at the piano where he performs part of the extremely personal ""Please Don't Ask"" which, somewhat ironically, ended up on Genesis' 1980 ""Duke"" album and not on ""Face Value"".  What makes this DVD even sweeter is that it has some actual footage from the original recording sessions which is a lot of fun to see.  This DVD really makes it clear that, aside from simply being a brilliant artist, Phil was really a musician's musician which makes it all the more ironic that he's earned the level of scorn over the years that he has.  On the downside to this video/ DVD, several songs from the album--""You Know What I Mean"", ""Thunder and Lightning"", and ""I'm Not Moving""--aren't even mentioned; this is probably in part because these tracks are presumably not among Phil's favorites, something he hints at near the end of the DVD.  Also, there's a painfully and mind-bogglingly slow live version of ""If Leaving Me Is Easy"" from 1985 that gets spliced in among the discussion of the track, and it's THEN followed by a straight-through version of that same performance which goes on for over 7 minutes and isn't even over when it gets cut off on the DVD--this seems like a clear attempt to pad the video/ DVD to reach the hour mark.  So, there are some gripes here, but it's still a must-have for any genuine Phil fan--if you can pick this DVD up for under $10, it's a great deal.",4,a little flawed & on the short side but overall pretty great,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,2922,"['combination', 'deep', 'emotions', 'eclecticism', 'just-plain', 'terrific', 'songwriting', 'Phil', 'Collins', '1981', 'debut', 'solo', 'Face', 'Value', 'one', 'greatest', 'albums', 'time', 'other', 'words', 'certainly', 'deserving', 'place', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'video/', 'DVD', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'priceless', 'documentary', 'terrific', 'look', 'making', 'Face', 'Value', 'album', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'goodies', 'Phil', 'sometimes', 'alone', 'sometimes', 'assistant', 'producer', 'engineer', 'Hugh', 'Padgham', 'many', 'songs', 'album', 'get', 'hear', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'album', 'such', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'dobro', 'playing', 'Roof', 'Leaking', 'Phil', 'early', 'demo', 'Missed', 'Again', 'DVD', 'features', 'interview', 'segments', 'many', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'album', 'including', 'Shankar', 'violinist', 'Louie', 'Satterfield', 'trombonist', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'Washington', 'who', 'arranged', 'horns', 'Arif', 'Mardin', 'who', 'did', 'string', 'arrangement', 'Leaving', 'Me', 'Easy', 'course', 'Phil', 'long-time', 'co-hort', 'Daryl', 'Stuermer', 'also', 'Alphonso', 'Johnson', 'who', 'sly', 'bass', 'guitar', 'hook', 'came', 'up', 'Must', 'Be', 'Love', 'addition', 'are', 'also', 'bits', 'Phil', 'manager', 'Tony', 'Smith', 'Genesis', 'Mike', 'Rutherford', 'Tony', 'Banks', 'legendary', 'co-founder', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'Ahmet', 'Ertegun', 'former', 'Virgin', 'Records', 'managing', 'director', 'Simon', 'Draper', 'Phil', 'typically', 'great', 'form', 'DVD', 'full', 'usual', 'wit', 'intelligence', 'get', 'segments', 'drums', 'as', 'well', 'piano', 'where', 'part', 'extremely', 'personal', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Ask', 'somewhat', 'ironically', 'ended', 'up', 'Genesis', '1980', 'Duke', 'album', 'not', 'Face', 'Value', 'What', 'DVD', 'even', 'sweeter', 'actual', 'footage', 'original', 'recording', 'sessions', 'lot', 'fun', 'see', 'DVD', 'really', 'clear', 'aside', 'simply', 'being', 'brilliant', 'artist', 'Phil', 'was', 'really', 'musician', 'musician', 'more', 'ironic', 'earned', 'level', 'scorn', 'years', 'downside', 'video/', 'DVD', 'several', 'songs', 'album', 'Know', 'What', 'Mean', 'Thunder', 'Lightning', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Moving', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'probably', 'part', 'tracks', 'are', 'presumably', 'not', 'Phil', 'favorites', 'something', 'end', 'DVD', 'Also', 'painfully', 'mind-bogglingly', 'slow', 'live', 'version', 'Leaving', 'Me', 'Easy', '1985', 'spliced', 'discussion', 'track', 'THEN', 'followed', 'straight-through', 'version', 'same', 'performance', '7', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'even', 'over', 'when', 'cut', 'off', 'DVD', 'clear', 'attempt', 'pad', 'video/', 'DVD', 'reach', 'hour', 'mark', 'So', 'are', 'gripes', 'here', 'still', 'must-have', 'genuine', 'Phil', 'fan', 'can', 'pick', 'DVD', 'up', '10', 'great', 'deal']",N/A
