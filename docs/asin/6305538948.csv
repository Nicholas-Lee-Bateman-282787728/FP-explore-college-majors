Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, David Arquette, Jeremy Davies star along with the Tatra Mountains of Slovakia (hey it's cheaper to film there). It wouldn't be inaccurate to consider it a kind of vampire story (but without fangs) set in the Old American West. Yet again vampirism serves as an apt metaphor for human behavior. There is a well known Nietzsche quote at the beginning which sums up the moral of our tale about mans' will to power. You don't have to think about that and you'll enjoy the blood and crazy wild west antics just as well. I happen to have just finished the epic Ken Burns docKen Burns Presents: The West. It was so-called Gold Fever that swept through the Eastern half of the United States and throughout the world in the 1840s that really drew masses of humanity into the Rocky Mountains and beyond and out to California. And the Indians were used and just disposed of along the way and people often behaved like animals. Hollywood created Manichean morality tales in the next century and national mythology overtook the public's imaginings of the 19th Century Western U.S., most folks now know and admit. A horror story the premise of which is an Indian tale about men consuming other men to gain strength -Western Civilization's lofty ideals from Plato and Aristotle to Christianity and the Bill of Rights be damned, btw-- has at least as much truth in it as a John Ford pageant.",4,tasteful,1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,1526,"['Ravenous', 'well-done', 'film', 'featuring', 'respectable', 'acting', 'excellent', 'location', 'terrific', 'memorable', 'score', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'star', 'Tatra', 'Mountains', 'Slovakia', 'hey', 'cheaper', 'film', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'inaccurate', 'consider', 'kind', 'vampire', 'story', 'fangs', 'set', 'Old', 'American', 'West', 'again', 'vampirism', 'apt', 'metaphor', 'human', 'behavior', 'well', 'known', 'Nietzsche', 'quote', 'beginning', 'up', 'moral', 'tale', 'mans', 'will', 'power', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'blood', 'crazy', 'wild', 'west', 'antics', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'happen', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'epic', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'docKen', 'Burns', 'Presents', 'West', 'was', 'so-called', 'Gold', 'Fever', 'swept', 'Eastern', 'half', 'United', 'States', 'world', '1840s', 'really', 'drew', 'masses', 'humanity', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'California', 'Indians', 'were', 'used', 'just', 'disposed', 'way', 'people', 'often', 'behaved', 'animals', 'Hollywood', 'created', 'Manichean', 'morality', 'tales', 'next', 'century', 'national', 'mythology', 'public', 'imaginings', '19th', 'Century', 'Western', 'U.S.', 'most', 'folks', 'now', 'know', 'admit', 'horror', 'story', 'premise', 'Indian', 'tale', 'men', 'consuming', 'other', 'men', 'gain', 'strength', '-Western', 'Civilization', 'lofty', 'ideals', 'Plato', 'Aristotle', 'Christianity', 'Bill', 'Rights', 'be', 'damned', 'btw', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'truth', 'John', 'Ford', 'pageant']",N/A

468904,ACAO2J1XCS4FL,6305538948,Alexander Suraev,"[1, 1]","The films I enjoy most are made by marginal directors having their way with a genre.  Ravenous is the perfect example.Robert Carlyle is perfectly cast as a folkloric devil, not a big mighty Satan, but a little  obscene trickster. But that giggling little monster is just a part of him.  First time we see him he is helpless, blubbering and scared little thing. I  think that impersonation is very important for Ives. He is acting a loser,  the pathetic sight, the victim he might become if he did not make the  fateful decision. He has to convince himself it was worth it.The music  accompanying the chase makes us think about the evil forest creatures of  frontier yarns and tall-tales that deal with death rather  matter-of-factedly. The predator is enjoying himself, smirking and  squinting - the jaunty eccentric. The second face of the demon.But in  the second half of the movie he looks resigned. Ives feels that he still  needs a justification. He has found The Way, he is The Predator and the  rest are The Victims. But something is gnawing at him.- It's a lonely  life. - as Jeffry Jones's character says. Ives needs the disciples - what  is a messiah without apostles!  A self-deluded maniac?Boyd seems to be a  perfect choice. The taste is not unfamiliar to him. He also needs a cure  from his feebleness, his fear, his guilt.Ives is not in a hurry to kill  him. The cannibal  approaches Boyd with his logic, he tempts him with the  strangely exhilarating memories, confronts with a life-or-death  choice.The little devil fails. First colonel decides to quit. Then Boyd  prefers to suffer and die rather than join the club.The final battle was  inevitable - it's XX Century Fox after  all! The film must end with  something climactic to sell more tickets, tapes and DVDs. It's funny to  watch mortal combat of two guys who  are not sure of their current status -  are they alive, dead or half-dead?Guy Pearce's role echoes his  L.A.Confidential big-screen debut. The award ceremony is practically the  same - Guy in uniform recieves the honors for the courage he does not feel.  He is still that reluctant hero with blood-smeared face. In both films he  gets an offer to cross to the dark side and kills the corruptor.I am not  going to comment on how good soundtrack is, Jeffry Jones superb acting or  Arquette guy's brief apperance which does not merit putting his name on  posters and DVD covers. It's all evident.Also I don't think there is any  sense in naming the film a Horror, Black Comedy or Historical Thriller -  marketing that movie is not our task.Let's just watch.",4,Refreshing messing with the genre(s).,956793600,"04 27, 2000",2000,2589,"['films', 'enjoy', 'most', 'are', 'made', 'marginal', 'directors', 'having', 'way', 'genre', 'Ravenous', 'perfect', 'example.Robert', 'Carlyle', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'folkloric', 'devil', 'not', 'big', 'mighty', 'Satan', 'little', 'obscene', 'trickster', 'giggling', 'little', 'monster', 'just', 'part', 'First', 'time', 'see', 'helpless', 'blubbering', 'scared', 'little', 'thing', 'think', 'impersonation', 'very', 'important', 'Ives', 'acting', 'loser', 'pathetic', 'sight', 'victim', 'might', 'become', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'fateful', 'decision', 'convince', 'was', 'worth', 'it.The', 'music', 'accompanying', 'chase', 'think', 'evil', 'forest', 'creatures', 'frontier', 'yarns', 'tall-tales', 'deal', 'death', 'rather', 'matter-of-factedly', 'predator', 'enjoying', 'smirking', 'squinting', 'jaunty', 'eccentric', 'second', 'face', 'demon.But', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'resigned', 'Ives', 'feels', 'still', 'justification', 'found', 'Way', 'Predator', 'rest', 'are', 'Victims', 'something', 'gnawing', 'him.-', 'lonely', 'life', 'Jeffry', 'Jones', 'character', 'disciples', 'what', 'messiah', 'apostles', 'self-deluded', 'maniac', 'Boyd', 'be', 'perfect', 'choice', 'taste', 'not', 'unfamiliar', 'also', 'cure', 'feebleness', 'fear', 'guilt.Ives', 'not', 'hurry', 'kill', 'cannibal', 'approaches', 'logic', 'strangely', 'exhilarating', 'memories', 'confronts', 'life-or-death', 'choice.The', 'little', 'devil', 'fails', 'First', 'colonel', 'quit', 'Then', 'Boyd', 'prefers', 'suffer', 'die', 'rather', 'join', 'club.The', 'final', 'battle', 'was', 'inevitable', 'XX', 'Century', 'Fox', 'film', 'must', 'end', 'something', 'climactic', 'sell', 'more', 'tickets', 'tapes', 'DVDs', 'funny', 'watch', 'mortal', 'combat', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'current', 'status', 'are', 'alive', 'dead', 'half-dead', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'role', 'L.A.Confidential', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'award', 'ceremony', 'practically', 'same', 'Guy', 'uniform', 'honors', 'courage', 'not', 'feel', 'still', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'blood-smeared', 'face', 'films', 'offer', 'cross', 'dark', 'side', 'corruptor.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'comment', 'how', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'Jeffry', 'Jones', 'superb', 'acting', 'Arquette', 'guy', 'brief', 'apperance', 'not', 'merit', 'putting', 'name', 'posters', 'DVD', 'covers', 'evident.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'sense', 'naming', 'film', 'Horror', 'Black', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Thriller', 'marketing', 'movie', 'not', 'task.Let', 'just', 'watch']",N/A

An army officer (Guy Pearce), decorated in  questionable circumstances, is banished to a remote outpost to become part  of  a shoddy ensemble of misfits including the drunk, the doped up weirdo  (David Arquette in a niche he has clearly made his own) and the bungling  bookworm who is the commanding officer. One stormy night, a stranger  (Robert Carlyle) intrudes on the quiet and recounts the terrible tale of  his ordeal amongst a snowbound party of travellers who, out of necessity,  turn to cannibalism. Things will never quite be the same for our motley  crew! Like all good fairy stories, ""Ravenous"" is at once scary and  irreverently amusing.....the horror is grotesque, but unreal. The casting  is first rate. Pearce and Carlyle make admirable opponents and Jeffrey  Jones adds to his portfolio of excellent character roles with a delightful  performance as the commanding officer. The cinematography is similarly  commendable, the stunning scenery being beautifully shot with an engrossing  attention to detail. The film combines elements of haunted house horror,  Western, black comedy and vampirism (a la  ""The Lost Boys"") in a unique and  thoroughly entertaining blend and this refreshing individuality  sets  ""Ravenous"" apart from the crowd.

This and STARSHIP TROOPERS are the two movies where I most had a hard time making up my mind. I certainly can't hate a new movie about the Mexican-American War  (forgotten by most, oddly, since we gained about a fourth or a fifth of our  total territory in the 1848 Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo). The  cinematography was gorgeous, Slovakia making a more than adequate double  for 1840s California. The acting was intriguing, as far as it went. Guy  Pearce was convincing as a callow officer who wasn't sure how to handle the  difficult situation in which he found himself (it had to be one of the most  anti-heroic performances I've ever seen). Robert Carlyle was fantastic,  looking every inch the 19th century folk villain. Jeffrey Jones is probably  one of our most underrated actors; I remember in 1986 he played Thomas  Jefferson in the CBS &quot;George Washington&quot; miniseries AND Dean  Rooney in &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off.&quot; This guy can do anything.  The movie really fell apart towards the end, I thought, but it was still a  worthwhile and jarring experience. If you still can't take it, than at  least buy the soundtrack, which was alone worth the price of admission.  Hopefully this will begin a groundswell of movies on the 1846-48 war (and  other little known features of 19th century American history), as Tom  Berenger's ONE MAN'S HERO (about the Mexican Army's San Patricio Regiment,  composed of Irish Catholic deserters from the U.S. Army) is scheduled to  come out soon (I believe).",4,Oregon or Bust,957484800,"05 5, 2000",2000,1577,"['still', 'have', 'extremely', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'movie', 'STARSHIP', 'TROOPERS', 'are', 'two', 'movies', 'where', 'most', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'up', 'mind', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'new', 'movie', 'Mexican-American', 'War', 'forgotten', 'most', 'oddly', 'gained', 'about', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'total', 'territory', '1848', 'Treaty', 'Guadeloupe', 'Hidalgo', 'cinematography', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'Slovakia', 'making', 'more', 'adequate', 'double', '1840s', 'California', 'acting', 'was', 'intriguing', 'as', 'far', 'went', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'was', 'convincing', 'callow', 'officer', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'handle', 'difficult', 'situation', 'found', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'anti-heroic', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'was', 'fantastic', 'looking', 'inch', '19th', 'century', 'folk', 'villain', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'remember', '1986', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'CBS', 'quot', 'George', 'Washington', 'quot', 'miniseries', 'AND', 'Dean', 'Rooney', 'quot', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off.', 'quot', 'guy', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'movie', 'really', 'fell', 'apart', 'end', 'thought', 'was', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'jarring', 'experience', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'least', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'alone', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'begin', 'groundswell', 'movies', '1846-48', 'war', 'other', 'little', 'known', 'features', '19th', 'century', 'American', 'history', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'ONE', 'MAN', 'HERO', 'Mexican', 'Army', 'San', 'Patricio', 'Regiment', 'composed', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'deserters', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'scheduled', 'come', 'out', 'soon', 'believe']",N/A

Captain Boyd 'Guy Pearce', Army captain, helps rescue a Scottish pioneer who starts telling Boyd and his men stories about settlers whom he was traveling with.. who, due to their lack of food and losing their way, ended up having to turn to cannibalism in order to survive. He informs the men where this incident took place and soon they are off to find the cave this happened in. His version of the story was quite interesting to listen to and I thought this was probably going to be a really good movie.. At this point in the movie I already had an idea of what was going on and what was probably coming next..So the fort brigade sets out to find this cave, starts to investigate and in the process finds out the truth of what happened out there. From there it gets more interesting after some long chase scenes accompanied by strange and fittingly out of sync music. Anyway, Its kind of like the donner party story but this guy forces people to do certain things or die. The villian is an interesting character but the ending was somewhat disapointing and i was left feeling slightly let down by it even though it may be considered fitting for some considering the circumstances. This one can be considered more of a dark comedy thriller set in the 1840s. It started off somewhat slow then became more interesting as the movie went on.

Seriously, it was ""Small World"" annoying.The only other flaws in my opinion were that the dialog in the last third of the film strayed from the period dialog in the earlier parts.  It kind of morphed from ""Deadwood"" to any modern slasher film (not that the dialog ever approached the complexity of ""Deadwood"").Also, the opening sequence almost seemed comical - down to the light-hearted sound mixing when the ""Eat me"" quote popped up.  It set the wrong pace for the rest of the film.Finally, David Arquette - who seems miscast in every film in which he appears - was little more than an 1847 Jeff Spicoli.  It was a shame that his character outlasts the much better actors.Those were the bad things.  The rest was really a fun watch.

When I come across strange movies, it is usually a comedy or satire. However, this movie is completely serious. How many cannibal movies do you come across that is a combination of unique/serious/good? Not many, I bet.I first saw this movie in 1999 and I was shocked speechless. It was truly a sight to behold. The characters were great, the music was excellent, and the story kept me interested from beginning to end. It wasn't just these qualities that made it great, but the atmosphere and the setting really came through.The setting is Fort Spencer, 1840's. The man we focus on? Boyd. He was a celebrated officer, but only because he played dead to capture the enemy commander. His superior was disgusted and sent him to Fort Spencer. There, he thought he might have found some peace among the band of mismatched people. However, a man in ragged clothing soon comes into the fort with a desperate tale of cannibalism. Things may not be as they seem, though.I was really captivated by this movie, but two things really bothered me.WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!During a part of the movie, Boyd finds out the truth about Ives, and tries to kill him. However, this stupid Indian woman believes that Boyd must die if Ives die, and she stops every attempt he makes to kill Ives. Now, killing Ives would be a good thing, so why the hell is she stopping him? Does she want to be killed? Or is she just an idiot? This is a rather poor plot point.Another thing that bothered me was Ives' desire for companionship. Now, he knew fully well that Boyd is dangerous, and should not be kept around, yet he keeps him alive. Colonel Hart would have been enough, but by keeping Boyd around, Ives put himself in trouble. Perhaps this was a part of his psychology and he really wanted to die, but was too afraid to commit suicide. However, the movie didn't give any clear indication of this or anything else, in my opinion.END SPOILERSBesides those two things, everything else about this movie was damn good. I highly recommend this movie for anyone, except for young children, and by young children, I mean kids 7 and younger. Lets face it, people, most kids older than that have seen worse.

Others recommend that trooper be slow braised in red wine and onions, a kind of trooper bourguignon, which will produce a deep red sauce. Most, however, speak to trooper served simply, with a slight dusting of salt if available, and as fresh as can be.--From Recipes for the Ravenous, from Ribald Rangers to Raw RecruitsWith the exception of the last 10 minutes, Ravenous is a fine movie, full of revoltingly intelligent horror, with a disgustingly vivid storyline and nauseatingly moist close-ups. It's one of the best-photographed movies I've seen in a long time, and not just because of the entrails and caked blood. The movie looks cold to the bone, even inside the snow-laden huts and buildings that make up isolated Fort Spencer. The director, Antonia Bird, gives us strong story telling. The horror and the prospects of what we'll see are matched with restrained plotting and persuasive acting. The situation is outlandish and we can't help but smile at how cleverly Bird serves it up on a plate for us. At the same time, what happens to the characters isn't funny at all. It's Grand Guignol in the snow.The movie is set in the late 1840's, high in the California Sierra Nevada mountains. Fort Spencer is a small outpost, with only eight men. Three are important to us. The rest are important for other reasons. There's Captain Boyd (Guy Pearce), who was a coward in the Mexican-American War. He wound up in a pile of corpses, their blood tricking into his mouth, but eventually did a heroic deed. He was awarded a medal and then promptly sent to the isolated Fort Spencer. There's Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), the commanding officer of the detachment's seven men. And there is the ragged man (Robert Carlyle) who, one frigid night, nearly out of his mind and nearly dead of the cold, staggers to the fort. He says he is F. W. Colqhoun. He has quite a tale to tell. Part of it is true. The other part? Think of an old Indian legend that when one dines on another person, one gathers in that other person's strength. A bite of liver, a chew of thigh will set up a man for days with good humor and virility...heals wounds and cures sickness, too.Whether California will be populated by settlers and gold prospectors or by military cannibals depends on a coward who is trying to fight his inclinations. That brings us to the showdown battle between two men who, having dined recently, have great strength. It's a battle that is loaded with big-fight, gruesome clich&eacute;s. The movie is so sly and original that it's a shame it is stuck with a climax that is so predictably groan-slash-slice-stab-squirt. The final scene, involving a general and a pot of stew, seemed to me to be just a cheap final laugh. It made pointless Colonel Hart's integrity and Captain Boyd's bravery. It undercut the reason for the two men's final actions.Robert Carlyle chews the snowy scenery but he's a fine actor. Guy Pearce has the tough job of being a frightened coward, yet brave and honorable when it comes down to it. Jeffrey Jones' as Colonel Hart gives the most intriguing performance, in my view. Hart looks like a disintegrating, heavy-set buffoon when we first meet him. He turns out to be a competent, thoughtful, well-educated officer who knows his men, knows himself and knows his job. And he knows the horror he's become. Jones gives a dramatic, ironic, likeable performance.Ravenous is a first-class movie with a second-class ending.",4,"Which to use?

One said to the other: ""Does this taste funny to you?""Did you hear about the cannibal who passed his uncle in the woods?All right, maybe those jokes aren't of the highest caliber but I needed some way to start my review...written by Ted Griffin (Matchstick Men) and directed by Antonia Bird (Mad Love), Ravenous (1999) stars Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential, Memento) and Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty).  Also appearing is Jeffrey Jones (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Beetle Juice), John Spencer (""The West Wing""), Neal McDonough (Minority Report), Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan), Stephen Spinella (Great Expectations), Joseph Runningfox (Seems Like Old Times), Sheila Tousey (Lord of Illusions), and David Arquette (Eight Legged Freaks).The film, set around the time of the Mexican-American War (about 1847) begins as we see U.S. army man John Boyd (Pearce) being promoted to the rank of captain, to which afterwards he's sent off to a remote outpost in mountains of California.  Sort of an odd reward for a military hero, but given the circumstances to which Boyd received his promotion, those in charge didn't want him around (seems an act of cowardice on Boyd's part led to him single-handedly capturing some Mexican military leaders...for the rest of the story you'll have to see the film).  Anyway, the outpost, known as Fort Spencer, is somewhat of a dump, populated by a handful of interesting types, is basically a stopping point for westward travelers headed towards the Sierra Nevadas.  Shortly after Boyd's arrival a half frozen/half starved man named Colqhoun (Carlyle) wanders into the camp and relates a fantastically disgusting tale about how he and his party of settlers, heading west, got caught in the mountains and resorted to eating each other after all other viable (and not so viable) foodstuffs ran out.  Seems Colqhoun himself participated in the cannibalism, but then fled out of fear of becoming the next one to be consumed, which elicits a myth from one of the local Native Americans about a creature known as `Weendigo', a beast that thrives on human flesh, gaining the strength, the essence, of those it eats.  The downside, apparently, is cannibalistic activity results in an ever-growing desire to feast on even more flesh.  Anyway, a small detachment heads out to where Colqhoun and his group ended up in search of anyone who might be left, but once they arrive they learn some interesting, and important, details conveniently omitted in Colqhoun's original story...and this is where the plot synopsis ends specifically because to go any further would reveal some of the twists that should only be revealed during the viewing of the film.  I will say this, though...things get really messy...An interesting thing occurred to me while watching this film, that being this is the first feature I've watched in awhile that was directed by a woman, namely Antonia Bird.  As it turns out Bird actually replaced the individual originally intended to direct, a person by the name of Milcho Manchevski, who I'm not familiar with...seeing how most of the film was shot in Eastern Europe (Slovakia, I believe), I'm guessing the producers had originally chosen a local director (Manchevski is Macedonian by birth) before settling on Bird for whatever reasons.  Anyway, I've seen this film twice now and I'll admit the first time it didn't appeal as much to me as it did the second time around.  Why?  That's not entirely certain, but I guess maybe it has something to do with the bizarre, non-traditional soundtrack.  I've since come to appreciate the soundtrack, and while it may not entirely fit within the period or tone of the story, it does add some unexpected whimsy amidst the buckets of blood.  Generally I prefer a score to fit with the film and to be unobtrusive as not to draw excessive attention to itself, but I'm willing to acquiesce on occasion.  As far as the performances, I thought Robert Carlyle did pretty well and most of the rest well enough.  I did have a problem with one or two of the characters, though, the main being the one played by Guy Pearce.  Seeing how he was initially depicted as a coward in the beginning of the film (who later finds strength in an unusual place), I had a difficult time developing any sympathies for him or his predicament that develops after he's shipped off to Fort Spencer, which presented a bit of a problem for me given he was the main protagonist within the story.  Maybe this was the intent, I don't know, but it's difficult for me to get behind a character with such fundamental flaw, albeit one that does figure heavily into the actual story.  As far as the production I thought the direction was handled very well, obviously by someone who knew what they were doing, and the overall production values (the sets, the costumes, etc.) looked authentic for the time, to me at least, but then again I'm no expert on period design (at the very least there seems to be no one running around the film wearing sneakers or a Casio watch).  There are some fairly distasteful sequences (along with gallons of blood), but given the story involves cannibalism it would have been difficult to not show someone actually consuming the flesh of another.  All in all if you can get past the gorier bits you may find this an interesting film, one that doesn't often take itself very seriously (especially given the soundtrack), and features a definite `man vs. himself' theme with a few twists.This film's been released to DVD twice so far, once in 1999 and again in 2005.  I have the earlier version, the one with a prominent headshot of Guy Pearce (the 2005 release has a headshot of an indistinct face with its mouth wide open) so I'm unsure if the features available on the 1999 version are the same as on the 2005 release.  Anyway, the picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) looks very good and the audio, available in both English 5.1 Stereo Surround and Dolby Digital Surround comes across well.  As far as extras there's three, separate commentary tracks, one with director Antonia Bird and composer Damon Albarn, a 2nd with actor Robert Carlyle, and the third with writer Ted Griffin and actor Jeffrey Jones.  Also included are photo galleries, deleted scenes with optional commentaries, the original theatrical trailer, a TV spot, and subtitles in English and Spanish.Cookieman108",4,"""It's tough being a cannibal.

Chase ""cchase8860""","[10, 13]","If you know anything about the storied history of this film, you find yourself amazed and pleased, even after the nine-thousandth viewing, that it turned out as well as it did.What with Antonia Bird serving as the replacement for RAVENOUS' first director, Milcho Manchevski, and the eleventh-hour addition of the marvelous Robert Carlyle, it's no surprise that the plot and tone are schizoid as they are. And just the fact that the score was co-composed by avant-garde specialist Michael Nyman and former BLUR frontman Damon Albarn, speaks volumes about what the wary (or unwary) cinematic *CONSUMER* should expect.Which is a ride not for the faint-of-heart or the squeamish. Captain John Boyd (Pearce) has just received an award for bravery, for a heroic act of valor performed during a battle in the Spanish-American War. Only he, his superior officer, Gen. Slauson (WEST WING'S John Spencer) and the audience know that he's a lily-livered coward at heart. He was only able to capture an enemy outpost after playing dead under a stack of the bodies of his butchered comrades.Disgusted with him, but well aware that political correctness won't allow him to have a war hero tried and executed for cowardice under fire, Slauson does the next best thing...he has Boyd &quot;reassigned&quot; to what could be seen as the American answer to the Gulag...Fort Spencer, out in the middle of hell-and-gone, somewhere in California, by way of the same route that the Donner party was unlucky enough to take, (making you wonder if maybe they ran into somebody in this movie!)Anyway, our outcast war hero finds the fort manned by a colorful cast of misfits: Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones), as bookish and erudite as you wouldn't expect the commander of a hole in the sticks to be; Private Toffler (Jeremy Davies), a man as devoutly religious as he is sweetly and inherently inept; outpost sawbones Major Knox (Stephen Spinella), who takes the phrase &quot;Physician, Heal Thyself&quot; literally, staying liberally medicated with anything that comes 100 proof from a bottle; the muscularly malevolent Private Reich (Neal McDonough), who proves that one can take being &quot;all that you can be&quot; too far indeed, and Pvt. Cleaves (David Arquette), the Old West's answer to the resident slacker, who believes his goal in life is discovering &quot;better living through chemistry&quot; in every way the fort can provide.Rounding off the group is George (Joseph Running Fox) the local guide and Cleaves' peyote-and-peace-pipe partner, and his sister Martha (Sheila Tousey), who brings as much of a woman's touch to daily life at Spencer as this crew is likely to get.Not long after Boyd's arrival, a haggard stranger stumbles into their midst, half-dead from fright, exposure and starvation. Introducing himself as the Rev. F.W. Colquohon, (Robert Carlyle), he explains how he came to be there, regaling the men of Fort Spencer with a tale of misfortune, murder and cannibalism that would give Stephen King the willies.Alarmed by the possibility that some of the people Colquohon was traveling with may still be alive, Col. Hart and his men immediately set off on a rescue mission...which is where the fun of RAVENOUS really begins. Throw in deception, more murder, more cannibalism and just a touch of the supernatural, via an arcane Native American legend, and you're in for a stomach-churnin', knee-slappin' good time!It's a damn shame that Fox didn't know (and probably didn't care about) how to sell this, because it's a cult hit sleeper in waiting if there ever was one. Sly commentary about everything from rampant consumerism and &quot;manifest destiny,&quot; to male-bonding of a different kind abounds between fits of gore and grue, and a game cast sinks its teeth into some characterizations as unforgettably vivid as the fast-paced story will allow them to be.Kudos especially to Carlyle, whose Colquohon will stick in your memory long after the last tasty, twangy note of the engagingly oddball soundtrack has faded away.More's the pity that a featurette about the making of the movie and the soundtrack is not included. To say that there isn't anything else like it would usually be regarded as a cheap cliche. In this case, it's a (gross) understatement about a film worth every bit of your time.

468933,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,6305538948,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[4, 7]","There is a huge, hairy, bellicose bellowing beast perched there on the edge of the Sierra Nevadas: a slavering, hungry, big-bellied monster that has slobbered and howled and eaten its way West, gobbling up bankers and railroad tycoons and cowboys and gunslingers and soldiers, tinkers, tailors, spies, the entire Indian Nation and itinerant railroad coolies from Cathay.Its name is Manifest Destiny---and O Hail Columbia, It's Hungry! It's Hungry for more.The spirit of consumption, ingestion, devouring the heart of the Enemy and making his strength your own---not only was that the spirit that fired our young Republic's westward march, but it's the same spirit that serves as the guts and glory of ""Ravenous"", a modern anthem to good hearty eating and the pioneer spirit.More a Weird Wild West vampire tale than anything else, Ravenous entertains in fits and starts---but what atmospheric and blackly funny fits and starts! Ravenous is a decidedly off-beat and undeservedly underrated little horror tale with nice big chunks of frontier adventure, cabin-fever craziness, cannibalism and ghoulishness, Indian devil lore, and shades of the Donner Party, all served in hearty helpings with fine cinematography, glorious sets, sumptuous costumes, and actors who look like they just step out of a 19th century daguerrotype.Tasty.Director Antonia Bird distinguished herself with the deft and entertaining but uneven and preachy Priest, which was an effective cinematic diatribe against Catholic orthodoxy. In Ravenous, Bird is not out to preach to anyone, which is what makes the film so much good fun: it is a finely drawn exercise in black humor, unnerving and harrowing (and often eerie) yet also impish and nastily funny. ""Isn't this civilized?,"" asks Jeffrey Jones's revivified Colonel while chowing down on a stew made from the fort's drunken Major, and the answer is, hysterically, yes---civilizingly good cinema about men on the edge getting pushed all the way over it.Hero Guy Pearce (Memento), whose sturdy cheekbones and Pimpernel-esque diction stole the show in the mediocre Count of Montecristo, plays a strangely understated---and thus doubly effective---role as Captain John Boyd, an American officer decorated for his bravery in the Mexican-American war. But Boyd is not a hero, rather a coward who can barely stand the sight of blood (he gets over it), and whose heroism was largely accidental. The Army Brass knows this but nonetheless needs a hero: Boyd is feted and feasted, treated with a rousing rendition of ""Hail Columbia"" as interpreted by a bunch of psychotic 4th graders, and dispatched to the lonely hinterland outpost Fort Spencer, which sits on the verge of the Sierra Nevada mountains.Transfer or penance: Boyd barely gets settled down for a long winter's night when the Stranger staggers out of the deep black fierce woods, pushing his stark white face up against the fort windows.The Stranger(the leering, grinning, slavering Robert Carlyle) bears with him a ravening, Donner-esque tale of a lost party of snowbound travelers, drowned in horror, futility, and death in the snow-choked passes.Oh, and Cannibalism, did I mention that? People gotta eat.An expedition party is hastily assembled to search out any survivors: from there our quirky band of misfits---and ""Ravenous""---lurches into a darker domain.The first half of the film is a blend of paranoid frontier adventure and outright horror, with Carlyle's stranger one of the more terrifying and mysterious fiends in cinematic history. The second half of the movie is considerably less frightening (and thus slightly disappointing, given the first 60 minutes of lead-in and the snippet of Wendigo legend), and Ravenous becomes more of a variation on the standard vampire tale. To say more about the mechanics of this shift would be to spoil the fun.Ravenous works on so many levels: the rough and forbidding scenery (with Czech mountains doubling for the Sierras) and the capricious score work as characters in their own right. The cinematography is outstanding, and Bird makes good use of the unyielding landscape without and the shadowy and claustrophobic fort interiors (thrown into darkness by the natural light) within.Finally, the acting is superb, from Jones's bookish Colonel to David Arquette's short but tasty role as a cook (what else?) who inhales a little too much from a peace pipe. Rich in atmosphere, rife with deviltry, stewed and simmered in spicy Manifest Destiny, this film is a fine, hearty stew of a horror movie.

468935,A35MB3HSLQBXBG,6305538948,David Freydkin,"[4, 6]","I enjoyed this movie. I think you should watch it. However, don't expect to be moved by it or gain anything from it. One thing for sure, it is not a movie like any other one you've watched.Ravenous is based on a Native American folklore called weendigo. That is if a man consumes another man's flesh, the man also consumes his strength. Hence, the consumer's hunger becomes insatiable. He keeps on wanting more (more human flesh) and the only way to stop this is death.The main character Boyd, played convincingly by Guy Pearce,  experiences weendigo on the battlefield during the war against Mexico. He hides under a pile of dead men out of cowardice, unintentionally swallows blood dripping from a dead soldier on top, and hence gains strength and single-handedly conquers the Mexican command, thereby becoming a hero by being a coward.He tells his commanding officer about this and the disappointed officer stations him in Fort Spencer, a post in the isolated snow-covered area in or near California. The post consists of several very odd characters, including a funny commanding officer played by Jeffrey Jones, a very religious soldier, a hard-core maniac soldier, two Native Americans, a drunk, and some total weirdo played by David Arquette (couldn't figure out that character, perhaps he was on drugs).Soon the group is joined by Calhoun, a cannibalistic officer also possessed by Weendigo. Now, can Boyd become a true hero and save the group from Calhoun?The movie has some pretty cool scenes.

468941,AKZMP6OOE89GV,6305538948,Elite14,"[2, 2]","This is a very difficult movie to review. How do I explain a movie about cannibalism? Which is exactly what this movie centers on. When this film came out, 20th Century Fox advertised this like it was a dark comedy. While it does have it's share or quirky moments, it's not a comedy. This is a gore picture, plain and simple. Oh and did I mention the cannabalism?Guy Pierce plays a misunderstood 'war-hero'. During the Spanish-American war (this film is set in 1840), while on the battlefield, he took over the Spanish command post of the area he was fighting in. What he didn't mention to everyone, was that he did it out of cowardice. During the battle, he played dead on the battlefield and was buried with his dead companions in a large trailer full of bodies. He then spent the next few days drinking his commanding officers blood running down from his half-blown off head. After drinking this blood, he then escapes and takes over the command post.After being awarded a medal for his actions, he is sent to Fort Spencer. You see, his general (John Spencer) knows what really happened and wants him nowhere near his troops. So, he is sent to the middle of nowhere in the snowy mountains of Nevada (or so they say in the film). Fort Spencer is being watched over by 7 people. Each has their own characteristics and are actually quite interesting.One night they are paid a visit by a wandering stranger (Robert Carlyle) who is on the verge of death. He then tells them all a story about cannabalism. It seems that the party he was with, got caught in the storm and seeked shelter in a cave. One of the males then preceeded to eat everyone. He mentions there might be survivors. Some of the people of Fort Spencer then plan to travel to the cave to look for these survivors. And that's where the story really begins to kick in.I won't give away the details, but it has a couple nice twists to it and you get great performances from Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. After you see Carlyle in this, you will never look at him the same again. The supporting actors are also quite good. David Arquette, however, makes me want to hit him every time I see him act. But contrary to the advertisment campaign, he is not in the film that much.If you have a weak stomach, I would recommend not watching this movie. While it isn't a horror movie, per se, it's definately got many grusome images. It's really a movie that doesn't fit into and ONE genre. It has some quirky comedy. It definately can creep you out at time. It's very gory. But, the main core of the movie is centered around cannabalism and some old Indian myth of a 'Wendigo'. Apparently a Wendigo is a person who has ate the flesh of man and then gets a undeniable hunger for it. He has to kill and eat man to quench his thirst. The thirst will never go away and for every human you eat, you consume their spirit. In essence you grow very strong, heal much faster and feel better than you ever have. It's quite interesting &amp; disturbing at the same time.I don't feel this film was given a fair shot at the box office. The advertising was way off and gave you the wrong idea. Then again, how do you advertise a movie that is centered around man eating the flesh of another man? This is a VERY original movie, and that is rare in these days of Hollywood cookie-cutter type movies. I would definately give it a rent. It's not for everyone, though.The DVD comes with 3 commentary tracks, deleted scenes, tv spots, photo galleries, and costume &amp; set designs.

Never the less, fifteen years later I've finally caught up with the underrated cannibal cult classic &#34;Ravenous&#34; thanks to a new high-definition transfer. All but ignored upon its initial theatrical run, this effective little horror thriller deserves to be seen by all genre fans.After being released from active duty in the military, Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce) is stationed at an out-of-the-way outpost in the Sierra Nevada wilderness. In the cold of winter, he and his fellow officers find a wanderer (Robert Carlyle) who tells a disturbing tale of his struggle to survive the grips of a cannibalistic traveler. He leads a rescue team to save the last remaining survivor of the slaughter. What will they find when they arrive?Although it's been given a hi-def overhaul for Blu-ray, &#34;Ravenous&#34; still holds on to its &#34;real&#34; film flavor. The picture is clean and clear, but there's the beautiful grain texture to it you expect from movies made before the mid-2000s. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound puts viewers in the middle of the action and mayhem.&#34;Ravenous&#34; is rated R for considerable gore, strong violence, language, and brief nudity. Besides the cannibalism, there's also a disturbing scene containing a broken bone sticking out of a soldier's leg. We get a nice quick glance at Robert Carlyle's skinny hind-end as well.Scream Factory packs the Blu-ray edition of &#34;Ravenous&#34; full of bonus material. Commentary is featured by Director Antonia Bird, Composer Damon Albarn, Screenwriter Ted Griffin, and Actors Jeffrey Jones and Robert Carlyle. Antonia Bird provides commentary for deleted scenes as well. A theatrical trailer and TV spots are included. Two still galleries and costume and production design information round out the special features.Director Antonia Bird and Writer Ted Griffin fill &#34;Ravenous&#34; with all sorts of surprises, gory thrills, and sheer lunacy thanks to a great performance by Robert Carlyle. Here's the perfect example of a movie where, even though it's been out for over a decade, no one wants to spoil its shocking revelations. Paired with a very bizarre musical score, it makes for a cinematic experience no horror enthusiast will want to miss.",4,Hungry for Horror?

468946,A2WETFLJM0D6R0,6305538948,"ewomack ""ewomack""","[113, 119]","This is going to sound strange, but &quot;Ravenous&quot; is a very intelligent movie about cannibals, vampirism (of an unusual sort) and the history of the west. At it's heart is a metaphor about power, exploitation, and ravenous greed. It is much more than simply a thriller, horror, slasher picture.It is set during the time of westward expansion in the youthful United States, which is significant for discovering what the movie is all about. This movie wouldn't make sense in 20th century Manhattan, or in 1930s Chicago. It is set during a time when european settlers still had a long way to go towards 'conquering' most of North America.Without giving too much away of the bizarre and twisted plot, the movie explores not only cannibalism, but cannibalism as a means of regaining life, energy, or power. You eat another, you take the life energy of that person. This notion of cannabalism (which is more along the lines of mythology than of a slasher movie) allows the movie to be completely unpredictable, disturbing and poignant all at once. At the end of the movie, one realizes that it would've been almost impossible to have guessed what was going to happen at each plot turn. If you enjoy bizarre, almost surreal surprises, this movie is packed with them.The crucial moment in the film is towards the end when Robert Carlyle's character is rhapsodizing about &quot;manifest destiny.&quot; Here it is revealed that what's behind the ravenous hunger depicted in the film is a statement about how the west was won, and perhaps still being won. There's a lot in this film to chew on (it's impossible to avoid stupid puns when writing about movies in which people are eaten, sorry), and &quot;Ravenous&quot; does not belong in the same category as B-slashers or gore or shock flicks.In fact, it's almost impossible to determine what category to put &quot;Ravenous&quot; in. People who avoid gore movies will probably also want to avoid this one (it can be pretty disgusting), and people who enjoy gore and slash will probably feel disappointed because there's simply more going on than random and senseless killing. It's no surprise that this movie bombed, and it will probably gain cult status and continue to confuse most viewers, but for that reason it will probably be around for a while.The performances are great all around, but Robert Carlyle really, really shines. The story is so original it nearly defies categorization, and the opening sequence is one of the best I've ever seen. The music is meant to be off-kilter and dissonant, which adds to the film's offbeat tempo.Overall a great movie, but one that may confuse viewers.

468948,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,6305538948,G. Denick,"[1, 1]","I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but ""Ravenous"" isn't so much ""horror"" as it is suspense and psychological drama, despite its rather morbid premise. Though cannibalism plays an enormous role in the plot of the movie, I was pleased to see that there is very little gore in the movie. It's mostly the concepts and discussion of cannibalism that exist, as opposed to showing mindless gore in an attempt to stun the audience. And in that regard, it succeeds, as the story is quite engaging, particularly with the emphasis placed on Native American folklore and the legend of ""The Wendigo"".I saw ""Ravenous"" when it was first released in the 90s, and it's held up remarkably well. It's still an incredible, gritty, emotional experience that transports you to a different time and place. You can almost smell the cold, crisp air of the American frontier, and you can almost feel the cold press of the winter air against your face. The smell of wood smoke drifting into your nose, the heavy feel of an axe as you split logs in an effort to survive the harsh winter... seldom do movies do such a fine job putting you in the middle of their world.The cinematography is stunning, establishing a beautiful, dangerous, and eerie setting, with excellent locations such as the forest, the military camp, and a rather infamous cave. The story is fascinating to watch unfold- I still find it gripping, even though I've seen it several times (this is testament to the downright astounding job the actors did, particularly Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle). The show stealer, however, is the unique soundtrack. There is nothing else like it- it seems to fit the period perfectly, yet it conveys a sense of tension, building suspense, and (eventually) utter desperation like no soundtrack I've ever heard before.""Ravenous"" is a five star film- and this is coming from somebody who doesn't care for horror movies.",5,"A haunting, unique, emotional masterpiece",1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,1892,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'Ravenous', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'horror', 'suspense', 'psychological', 'drama', 'rather', 'morbid', 'premise', 'cannibalism', 'enormous', 'role', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'gore', 'movie', 'mostly', 'concepts', 'discussion', 'cannibalism', 'exist', 'opposed', 'showing', 'mindless', 'gore', 'attempt', 'stun', 'audience', 'regard', 'story', 'quite', 'engaging', 'particularly', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'Native', 'American', 'folklore', 'legend', 'Wendigo', '.I', 'saw', 'Ravenous', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', '90s', 'held', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'still', 'incredible', 'gritty', 'emotional', 'experience', 'different', 'time', 'place', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'cold', 'crisp', 'air', 'American', 'frontier', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'cold', 'press', 'winter', 'air', 'face', 'smell', 'wood', 'smoke', 'drifting', 'nose', 'heavy', 'feel', 'axe', 'split', 'logs', 'effort', 'survive', 'harsh', 'winter', 'seldom', 'do', 'movies', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'putting', 'middle', 'world.The', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'establishing', 'beautiful', 'dangerous', 'eerie', 'setting', 'excellent', 'locations', 'such', 'forest', 'military', 'camp', 'rather', 'infamous', 'cave', 'story', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'unfold-', 'still', 'find', 'gripping', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'testament', 'downright', 'astounding', 'job', 'actors', 'did', 'particularly', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'show', 'stealer', 'however', 'unique', 'soundtrack', 'nothing', 'else', 'it-', 'fit', 'period', 'perfectly', 'sense', 'tension', 'building', 'suspense', 'eventually', 'utter', 'desperation', 'soundtrack', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Ravenous', 'five', 'star', 'film-', 'coming', 'somebody', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'horror', 'movies']",N/A
468949,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,6305538948,General Zombie,"[4, 5]","'Ravenous' is one of the strangest movies I've seen in recent memory.  It could roughly be defined as a horror-comedy, but it's not much like most of the famed examples of the genre, as it is more subtle and less reliant on slapstick, and also just serious more often than most films of this sort.  I think it could stand to be a little more serious overall, as it has some effective, largely unexploited horror concepts which are diminished somewhat by the humor.  (On the other hand, most of the humor *is* funny.)  Still, it's tough to argue with the results, and  this is definitely recommended to horror fans.  (That is, horror fans who are interested in actually seeing something a bit different rather than having the same damn formula repeated yet again.  Don't get me wrong, I like lots of derivative, innovation-free films, but lotsa people seem to demand that exclusively.)'Ravenous' is about cannibalism, a common enough horror staple, but it looks at it in a different way, avoiding either zombies or savages and exploring the Wendigo myths.  (i.e. The idea that a man could eat other men and grow to crave the flesh, needing more and more, while simultaneously gaining strength the more he eats, eventually becoming nearly superhuman.)  It's also different from most contemporary horror in that it uses a period setting, and an atypical period setting at that, which is 19th century America shortly after the Mexican-American war.  I'm no historian, obviously, but to my untrained eyes the film is quite visually convincing, readily evoking the period as I would imagine it.  (This is especially impressive considering the fairly low, 12 million dollar budget.)  Most of the action takes place in the Sierra Nevadas, which allows for some rather beautiful and striking scenery, which is generally nicely shot. (Well, takes place in the Sierra Nevadas of the mind, anyway.  I believe it was shot in Slovakia.)Anyway, the plot centers around one Capt. Boyd (Guy Pearce) who, as the film begins, receives a promotion and commendation for bravery after single-handedly capturing a Mexican command post.  Trouble is, he had, in fact, lain down and played dead during the battle, and only acted after being dumped in a pile of the dead.  The blood of his comrades flows into his mouth which causes him to freak out and apparently become somehow rejuvenated, allowing him to capture the post.  His CO knows that he was actually a coward, but he knows it would be unwise to punish him publicly, so he compromises by shipping him off to a remote fort in California, where he and the others are to help those on their way to the coast.  Some time after arriving a gaunt, half-dead man Colqhoun shows up at the fort.  His party came late and was snowed in, and they're eventually reduced to cannibalism.  It's worse than that, however, as one Col. Ives eventually went mad and started killing others for food, which caused Colqhoun to flee.  Boyd, Colqhoun and others return to their cave to investigate, and hopefully save those remaining, if any.  Needless to say, this is when things get really bad.That's a helluva a lot of plot synopsis, and there's a whole lot more that I don't wanna give away.  The film deserves a lot of credit for not going where you think it's going: After they returned to the cave I assumed that it would be nothing more than a slasher movie at that point, as Ives slowly picks off each of the party members.  This does, in fact, happen, but this is just a fraction of the movie, and I would never have predicted the major plot developments of the second half of the film.Though I've not really mentioned it much, this film actually has a lot of humor in it.  It's not really derived from the plot for the most part, the film is just filled with bizarre, quirky characters and comic dialogue.  It's not ever a riotously funny movie, but it's amusing, and, of course, also works on a horrific and dramatic level.  Sometimes the balance is off, however.  For example, at a few points Bird (the director) chose to compliment some forest chase scenes with goofy hoe-down music.  This actually manages the make these scenes somewhat lighthearted, but I don't think this really works dramatically, and fail to see the point.  (Especially since there isn't anything humorous about these particular scenes apart from the inappropriate music.)  Still, this misstep only stand out because of how consistently intriguing the film is otherwise.The acting is excellent all around.  Pearce probably has the most conventional role as our main character Boyd, but he does a fine, convincing job with it.  It's also interesting to see a (sort of) horror movie where the main character is something of a coward and in a relatively realistic way.  (Rather than simply running in terror he tends to become paralyzed with fear and hopelessly indecisive.)  Jeffrey Jones is also a particular standout as Col. Hart, commander of the fort.  He's just funny and likable, if a bit of a doofus, as per usual for him.  (From what I've seen, anyway.)  Robert Carlyle is very good as the mad Ives.  He makes for a villain not quite like any other I've seen.The film does faulter a little at the end as it degenerates into a big fist-fight which is just somewhat overly drawn out and is a little predictable and standard for a film which had been quite unpredictable beforehand.  It's not bad, by any stretch of the imagination, but I would've hoped for more.I suspect that upon further viewings my enthusiasm for this film might wane a bit, as it loses its novelty.  (You can never tell how a film will hold up to repeat viewings.  Who knows, maybe I'll like it more.)  Still, it would have to drop off a long way to cease being one of the most original and interesting horror films of the 90's.  Check it out.Grade: A-",5,"Quite Unique, Very Good",1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,5822,"[""'Ravenous"", 'one', 'strangest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory', 'could', 'roughly', 'be',

First, I found some of the soundtrack at times distracting and misplaced. Sometimes the soundtrack is great and hard hitting, but sometimes a great scene is flawed by an annoying banjo hobo tune. Also this films really lags for the first 15-20 minutes of the movie and the ending although not bad is less then thought provoking and great.This movie doesnt do anything to stir emotion, but its fun to watch. Robert Carlyle is so amazing as the evil loving villian! Guy Pearce is also amazing although his part wasnt complicated. Jeffrey Jones(from ferris bueller) and David Arquette are not well casted in this films even though they tried. Jeffrey Jones is too much like my uncle to come off as a believable evil character. David Arquette cant seem to play anything but the idiot in films and TV and didnt go well in this movie, but thankfully he wasnt in it much. thats about it for any problems I had with the film.Otherwise, I was pleased with this film. I love movies with evil characters who love to have fun while being evil(like Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"" or Mark Walberg in ""FEAR"") Robert Carlyle is awesome and delivers a 5 star performance as the villian. This is the first time I have seen him in any film and I must say that Im an instant fan.I gave it 3 stars, but its a film that you need to see if you love evil thrillers.

Great performances by all especially Guy Pearce. Being a big fan of LA Confidential this one was a far different character. Cursed by his cowardness during the war with Mexico he's constantly having flashbacks early on to the brutal battles and how he survived(you'll like that one). Soon he decides he had better escape but runs into the American counterattack on the Mexican base. He takes advantage of the situation by capturing the Mexican commanders. Instead of haning him for cowardness he's given a medal and treated like a hero. But his company commander knows the truth and wants him as far away from him and his men as possible. He sends him to a fort in the California mountains run by a skeleton crew. Soon a stranger is found passed out outside their fort. But he isn't what he seems.Ravenous has a peculiar combination of black humor and one of the best musical scores for a movie I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong the music isn't the best for any movie but it just fits into the movie so well its amazing. An eerie western mix that was brilliantly put together. The black humor might push some away, but for me it made it much more fun to watch.Ravenous no doubt deserves to have better track record than it does.

Robert Carlysle also had me on the edge of my seat at times. One thing that makes this a good film instead a truly  excellent one is the poor luck of the filmmakers. This was supposed to be  much like &quot;The Thing&quot;. The plot being that a few people got stuck  in the mountains during a snow storm and couldn't find food. The problem  is, it was filmed during El Nino, and the snow didn't come until the last  few days of shooting. So the whole time you're wondering why these people  got stuck, and why they can't find any food, since it's a green, albeit  muddy forest. The performances overshadow this plot iconsistancy however  and create a creepy web of paranoia which threatens to be their undoing.  The extras are cool, with a commentary track including Jeffrey Jones and  the director, a commentary track by Robert Carlysle (I don't recommend this  one, it doesn't even start until 20 minutes into the movie), deleted  scenes, and even an easter egg.

468965,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6305538948,Jeffrey Leach,"[6, 8]","John Boyd finds himself in a distinctly unenviable position at the beginning of &quot;Ravenous.&quot; Boyd, an army officer recently promoted for heroism in the Mexican War, is really a coward at heart. During action in that campaign, the young officer folded in the face of enemy fire, a deed that cost the lives of several of his men. Left for dead in a pile of bloody corpses by Mexican soldiers, Boyd managed to pull himself together and capture an enemy command post. Rather than have a supposed &quot;hero&quot; shot for dishonorable activities, an act that may not have the best results on general morale, the general commanding the army exiles Boyd to an out of the way heap of sticks in the wilds of California called Fort Spencer. Perhaps Captain Boyd should have fought bravely in Mexico because what he runs up against in California is enough to make the hardiest soul cry for his mother. &quot;Ravenous&quot; as a film slices across so many genre boundaries that it is difficult in the extreme to classify it. At turns gross out horror, serious drama, and social critique, even the studio had an impossible task while marketing this project. I vividly remember the television spots for &quot;Ravenous,&quot; and at the time I couldn't make heads or tails of what this movie was about.When Boyd arrives at Fort Spencer, he quickly discovers that he now lives in a place inhabited by various castoffs from the military. There is the commanding officer of the place, Colonel Hart, a bookish figure who spends his time reading Plato in the original Greek while cracking walnuts on his desk with a huge tome. Major Knox serves as the fort physician even though his training is in veterinary science. His favorite activity is drinking himself into unconsciousness every chance he gets. The preacher of the outfit looks like he would be more at home wandering the back alleys of a cesspool, as does the perpetually dense Private Cleaves. The only guy with any backbone in the outfit is the soldierly Private Reich, one of those gung ho types so annoying to people just trying to take it easy. Rounding out this bunch of miscreants are two local Indians. Director Antonia Bird does a marvelous job of fleshing out each one of these characters with a minimum of time and effort, but ultimately the stellar cast makes each of these unique individuals come alive. I won't go any further than mentioning the absolute majesty of Robert Carlyle's performance as Colquhoun. His telling of that gruesome story around the campfire never loses its intensity no matter how many times you watch the film. The cast in &quot;Ravenous&quot; is simply spectacular.Shortly after Boyd arrives at Fort Spencer, a straggler nearly dying of malnourishment wanders into the camp. Introducing himself as an itinerant preacher named Colquhoun, he tells a riveting story of murder, madness, and cannibalism to the fort personnel. It seems Colquhoun and a party of settlers failed to get out of the mountains before the winter storms set in, and after several miserable weeks slowly starving in a cave the settlers began eating one another in order to survive. Hart decides he must follow up on this strange story by launching an expedition into the surrounding mountains to look for the cave. &quot;Ravenous&quot; takes off like a jet plane at this point, as the expedition discovers a few shocking secrets about Colquhoun during the course of their mission. Apparently, the preacher became what the local Indians refer to as a Wendigo, a man transmogrified into a ravenous creature after devouring human flesh. Now Boyd and company must deal with the fallout from their encounter with this eerie being.The movie takes so many twists and turns from this discovery onwards that it would be a crime if I should spoil it for you. If Bird had decided to just make this a cannibal picture, it still would have entertained the horror crowd. Fortunately, she decided to use Algernon Blackwood's Wendigo legend as a thinly veiled metaphor for what the American government did in the western part of the continent during the nineteenth century. At one point during the film, Colquhoun crows to Boyd about the idea of &quot;manifest destiny&quot; and how the settlers will pour into California as soon as spring arrives, at which time the cannibals will feed off these hapless dupes. Why not tie the eating of human flesh with the economic appetites of the American people? Modern day Indians certainly could tell a tale or two about this seemingly disparate comparison.The DVD version of &quot;Ravenous&quot; fires on all cylinders. Not only do you get the movie in widescreen, you also get THREE commentary tracks, a trailer, deleted scenes with and without commentary, an easter egg, and storyboards about how the crew made the character's outfits and built Fort Spencer. Filming took place in Slovakia, of all places, and the scenery awes with its sweeping mountains and deep forests. My only complaint with the disc concerns the absence of separate audio tracks for the Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn soundtrack. Imagine a mix of folksy banjo with modern techno music and you have an idea of this film's intriguing aural backdrop. The fusion of these two odd musical genres might concern some people, but don't worry because the soundtrack works wonders in &quot;Ravenous,&quot; often making a terrifying scene even creepier by infinite degrees. Bird's little film may well be one of the best films of the 1990s, and is certainly one of the best horror films of that decade. As flavorful as the special stew Colquhoun cooks up for his fellow cannibals, &quot;Ravenous&quot; will continue to win fans for years to come.",5,"Simply Brilliant, Horrific Social

That's all okay,  because the rest of this film is delicious.  Oh wait, that came out wrong.  No, really, the movie was filmed very well, and the acting was incredibly  good, a sure highlight for Jeffery Jones, but This film, from almost every  angle, was brilliant.  From start to finish, it moves through  post-modernist film-styles to hokey slapstick, all the while manipulating  your reactions to it.  It's a two faced movie, the ultimate black comedy, a  contemporary macabre.  To illustrate it's manipulative nature and confusing  but extraordinary demeanor, we look to a scene of a psychotic cannibal  chasing down a scared-to-death preist in the woods, his chuckles audible  within the painful cries for help.  Our normal response is, well, not good,  as I would've viewed the scene as frieghtening enough, until...the music.  With a banjo/twang booming over this sadistic chase, we can see that the  film is most effetively humorous when the humor is post-production in  origin.  If it weren't for titles (a quote from 'anonymous':&quot;Eat  me.&quot;) and for the music, this film could've been passed off as a  brooding drama.  Thank god it wasn't because I haven't laughed that hard at  Jim Carrey.  I thought to myself, perhaps the actors weren't even aware of  what was going to happen in post-production, because they keep straight  performances, strictly drama.  The acting is superb, as I mentioned, and  Guy Pearce continues his great work as seen in the previous film &quot;L.A.  Confidential&quot;.  The same applies to Robert Carlyle, a wonderfully  psychotic slapstick actor and dramatic, see &quot;The Beach&quot;.

The music is the first thing you experience and really sets the tone. It has a fabulous ensemble cast, the sweet mousey priest, the babbling drug addict, stoic traumatized soldier, jaded, sarcastic colonel.. I just can't even... it's so perfect. It's campy in a lot of ways, but it's also very emotionally engaging as well. It's revealed in some of the first scenes, but the way the main soldier was traumatized was shocking and well done. It shows the horror of war, the horrible positions people can be put into and the vicious fight between bravery and cowardice. The first part of the film is great for the interaction of the rag tag group of soldiers far out in the mountains.

I see the supposed coward Boyd as the hero, the guy who resists even though his body cries out for blood, but after he succumbs, he realizes the grave mistake he's made and does the right thing.  And I see the film as a cautionary tale about human indulgence in all flesh-eating, including that of nonhuman animals. Significantly, a steel-jawed trap normally used for capturing wild animals provides the perfect ending to this well-executed, wonderfully acted, many-leveled, wittily presented story.

It is simply one of the strangest and most bizarre movies released by a major studio this year. Part horror, part sci-fi, part allegory, and part thriller, it is best described as a visual interpretation of an eerie story you would hear sitting by a campfire in the middle of the woods. It is those visuals which make it unsuitable to viewers with weak stomachs, because the violence is very graphic indeed.The date is about 1850. Captain John Boyd [Guy Pearce] has been deeply traumatized by a particularly bloody battle during the Mexican-American War. His commanding officer, appalled by Boyd's apparent lack of courage, assigns him to a small and unimportant fort in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. He finds that the small group of soldiers there are outcasts. One bitterly cold night, a nearly dead stranger is found in the snow. They revive him and ask him how he came to be lost in the wilderness. His name is Colquhoun, and, as played by the brilliant Scottish actor Robert Carlisle, he is one of the weirdest creatures the movie's have invented lately. He says that he was traveling west with a small group of pioneers. The journey took longer than expected, and they became trapped by the mountains' harsh winter weather. Although they found refuge in a cave, their supplies were inadequate for such a long delay. Finally, they killed the horses and ate them. Then one member of the group died. Afterwards, Colquhoun claims he went out foraging. When he returned, he found the group cooking the deceased. After hearing this grisly story, the fort's commander decides that a search party must go out to look for survivors.Tales of people resorting to cannibalism in such desperate situations are not new, but Colquhoun's story is only the start of this chilling movie. Things get much worse as the story takes its surprising twists and turns. No one is safe. I am rarely frightened by a movie, but this one gave me a definite case of the creeps.Much of the success of Ravenous is due to Robert Carlisle. Without him, it might have been nothing more than mere sensationalism. Carlisle often plays appealing, lovable characters. Here he gives us a portrait of a psychotic and creates a character that you will not soon forget. His Colquhoun is somewhat like Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs, although each actor's interpretation was uniquely his own.The photography captures the vastness and majesty of the American West. The set built for the fort seems very authentic. The music adds to the mystic tone of the movie. First rate character actors fill out the cast.While Ravenous is one of the best thrillers of the year, it is not, shall we say, to everyone's taste.",4,Mmmm-good!

468995,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6305538948,Michael R Gates,"[2, 2]","Even in the film genre of horror, cannibalism seems to be somewhat taboo.  However, its scarcity on the silver screen seems to be due less to censorship and more to the difficulty in dealing with the subject in a literate and--ahem!--tasteful manner.  With that in mind, 1999's RAVENOUS is definitely a rare and delectable treat.One of the best things about RAVENOUS is its dreary ambiance.  The dismal tone of the subject matter is established right from the beginning, when the film's protagonist, Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce)--a reluctant hero of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848)--is banished to a dilapidated , middle-of-nowhere Army outpost in the Sierra Nevadas as a punishment for cowardice.  In addition to being coldly isolated from the civilized world, the outpost is staffed by a wildly eccentric group of characters who, like Boyd, have obviously been stationed there to keep them out of the way.Not long after Boyd's arrival at the fort, a seemingly malnourished stranger (Robert Carlyle) staggers onto the grounds spouting a story about snowbound travelers, starvation, and cannibalism.  When he hints that there might yet be survivors at his gruesome campsite, Boyd's commanding officer, Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), leads his motley crew on a rescue mission.  And, of course, this is when the film gets to the &quot;meat&quot; of the story....Now, all of this may sound like the set-up for a rather grim movie, and while RAVENOUS is indeed rather grisly at times, it is also dotted with lots of wry funeral-parlor humor.  In fact, under its ensanguined facade, RAVENOUS is really a biting satire (excuse the pun) that takes rapier-like jabs at things such as modern material consumption and contemporary moral and political expediency.  And in its use of generally repulsive concepts and imagery to make the audience feel just a bit queasy about paradoxical Western social philosophy, RAVENOUS succeeds quite well.Although it is a good film, not every viewer will enjoy RAVENOUS.  Some horror fans may be put off by the ironic humor and sociological subtext, and many mainstream viewers will simply not be able to see far enough beyond the gore to even find the humor and subtext.  However, for film aficionados who have a palate for satire or horror of any flavor, RAVENOUS can be quite succulent.",4,A Biting Social Satire,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,2321,"['Even', 'film', 'genre', 'horror', 'cannibalism', 'be', 'somewhat', 'taboo', 'However', 'scarcity', 'silver', 'screen', 'be', 'due', 'less', 'censorship', 'more', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'subject', 'literate', 'ahem', 'tasteful', 'manner', 'mind', '1999', 'RAVENOUS', 'definitely', 'rare', 'delectable', 'treat.One', 'best', 'things', 'RAVENOUS', 'dreary', 'ambiance', 'dismal', 'tone', 'subject', 'matter', 'established', 'right', 'beginning', 'when', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Captain', 'John', 'Boyd', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'Mexican-American', 'War', '1846-1848', 'banished', 'dilapidated', 'middle-of-nowhere', 'Army', 'outpost', 'Sierra', 'Nevadas', 'punishment', 'cowardice', 'addition', 'being', 'coldly', 'isolated', 'civilized', 'world', 'outpost', 'staffed', 'wildly', 'eccentric', 'group', 'characters', 'who', 'Boyd', 'have', 'obviously', 'been', 'stationed', 'there', 'keep', 'way.Not', 'long', 'Boyd', 'arrival', 'fort', 'seemingly', 'malnourished', 'stranger', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'staggers', 'grounds', 'spouting', 'story', 'snowbound', 'travelers', 'starvation', 'cannibalism', 'When', 'might', 'yet', 'be', 'survivors', 'gruesome', 'campsite', 'Boyd', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Colonel', 'Hart', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'motley', 'crew', 'rescue', 'mission', 'course', 'when', 'film', 'quot', 'meat', 'quot', 'story', '.Now', 'may', 'sound', 'set-up', 'rather', 'grim', 'movie', 'RAVENOUS', 'indeed', 'rather', 'grisly', 'times', 'also', 'dotted', 'lots', 'wry', 'funeral-parlor', 'humor', 'fact', 'ensanguined', 'facade', 'RAVENOUS', 'really', 'biting', 'satire', 'pun', 'rapier-like', 'jabs', 'things', 'such', 'modern', 'material', 'consumption', 'contemporary', 'moral', 'political', 'expediency', 'use', 'generally', 'repulsive', 'concepts', 'imagery', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'just', 'bit', 'queasy', 'paradoxical', 'Western', 'social', 'philosophy', 'RAVENOUS', 'quite', 'well.Although', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'viewer', 'will', 'enjoy', 'RAVENOUS', 'horror', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'ironic', 'humor', 'sociological', 'subtext', 'many', 'mainstream', 'viewers', 'will', 'simply', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'far', 'enough', 'gore', 'even', 'find', 'humor', 'subtext', 'However', 'film', 'aficionados', 'who', 'have', 'palate', 'satire', 'horror', 'flavor', 'RAVENOUS', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'succulent']",N/A

For the first half of the film at least, we know that Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce) has experienced a life-changing event during the bloody slaughter of battle, eating the flesh of the dead in order to survive the carnage that rages around him. His 'reward' for survival is banishment to a remote military camp, a staging post for settlers travelling west, following the promise of the brave new territories opening up in the California of the 1840's. Life in this run-down camp is routine and boring, until a bedraggled stranger arrives with a terrible tale to tell. Wild-eyed and half-crazed, Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) explains he was part of a group of settlers that ended up in a nightmare of desperation, slaughter and cannibalism.  Everyone is aghast at his story and a search party is hastily gathered to hunt the culprits behind this inhuman act. But appetites have merely been wheted by this orgy of carnivorous murder and the unsuspecting soldiers cannot know that they are the main course. Only Boyd, who has tasted this meal before, has a sense of what terrors await.Director Antonia Bird does eke out some genuinely horrifying moments out of the story, building tension out of the setting and character rather than cheap thrills, as she shrewdly taps into universal dreads and fears. The story also plays with the idea that cannibalism somehow provides strength beyond mere fat and protein, capturing the spirit and essence of the hapless victim, giving the eater almost superhuman power in process.By setting the tale in the Old West,writer Ted Griffin - who scripted Best Laid Plans - gives his story a sense of distance and curiosity value. Elements of it seem like the kind of tale we have read about from history, while it also manages to avoid taking itself to seriously. Well acted by Guy Pearce, the ever-excellent Robert Carlyle and an impressive supporting cast, Ravenous manages to be dark, disturbing, stylized and over-the-top, all at once.

It details the exploits of Boyd (Pearce), a disgraced officer sent to a virtually abandoned post in the middle of nowhere in 1847.  But when a mysterious stranger (Carlyle) arrives with a chilling tale of cannibalism in the wilderness and they set out on a rescuse mission to find the remaining survivors things start spiralling out of all proportion.As weird as it is bizarrely gripping, 'Ravenous' is also genuinely horrific and there are scenes which will make even the most strong-stomached viewers look away.  It's a strange mixture of disgusting gore and comedy that will definitely make you laugh, albeit nervously.  There's also a strong vampiric feel to the film (especially in Carlyle's excellent performance) and the expected sexual imagery to go with the cannibalism.  There's even an eclectic bluegrass score worked on by Damon Albarn, ;ead singer in British indie group Blur.Pearce again turns in a magnificent performance that could easily have fallen into self-parody, and Carlyle is great fun.

Going through three directors (two jumped ship before star Carlyle suggested Brit Antonia Bird for the job), a troubled shoot and some decidedly dodgy marketing from 20th Century Fox (comical farce it is not and the trailer gives away one of the film's biggest plot twists!), it is amazing how &quot;Ravenous&quot; hasn't achieved its deserved cult status as yet. Which is a shame, as through the angry-looking gore and the queasily-black humour lies an absorbingly sharp film.Director Bird, who collaborates with Carlyle and co-composer Damon Albarn quite often, and writer Ted Griffin plump for the satirical nature of the script, with cannibalism portrayed as a metaphor for consumerism, as well as throwing in a few political asides (&quot;Ben Franklin once said: Eat to live, not live to eat,&quot; Carlyle's Colquhoun ponders at one point). Bird also chooses to not resort to cheesy heroics or 'hilarious' farce, but bravely plays up the seriousness of the destructive nature of the characters. She is aided in this task via wonderful performances from Guy Pearce as the reluctant hero, the under-rated Jeffrey Jones and the ever-wonderful Robert Carlyle.True, gore is never everyone's cup of tea, so to speak, but those aching for something a little bit different/substantial as opposed to those prone to insatiable bloodlust will gain something from the &quot;Ravenous&quot; experience.

469002,A11S26M1MUM7O7,6305538948,Neil Ford,"[6, 16]","There are many wonderful things about this movie. The cinematography is expert, the set design and costuming are convincingly detailed, and the major performances are all top-notch. The script has been modified and reduced to what I think is its most effective possible form. These factors combine in a manner that should be a terrific (and terrifying) movie experience. However, it doesn't quite work. The fault lies in the post-production, which presents the movie to the audience in an inappropriate way.Early in the commentary track by the director, Antonia Bird, and the composer, Damon Albarn, Bird refers to this movie as ""a satire"". This movie is a period piece about murder and worse, set in a remote part of the American frontier - what exactly is it supposed to be satirising? Cannibalism? The mind boggles. This error of intent is a clue to the problem with this film.In the same commentary, Albarn continually describes this movie as looking very ""European"", as opposed to American (i.e. the United States and Hollywood in particular). His disdain is obvious: ""European"" film is synonymous with quality, perceptiveness, and depth, as opposed to ""American"" crudity, ignorance, and shallowness. The validity of his prejudice could be debated at length. The problem, however, is that this opinion has led to the creation of a musical soundtrack which is inappropriately ironic in tone.During moments that should evoke great horror, revulsion and fear in the audience, the music remains above it all, with a dismissive ""what fools these mortals be"" attitude. Additionally, Albarn's pop music roots betray him: his music certainly is interesting, catchy and memorable (I found myself recalling several parts of it the next day), but it continually calls attention to itself, not only with its inappropriate attitude, but also with bizarre instrument choices, and vocal parts that confuse the viewer, who is unsure whether the voices originate from the characters or the music.These problems continually pull the viewer out of the movie, telling them that they must watch with ironic detachment rather than emotional involvement, but the movie itself doesn't justify this attitude. It is _not_ a satire, but rather a period horror movie, which admittedly has a strong streak of black humour.This misunderstanding led to a problem discovered during test screenings - the previewers said that they were didn't know whether they were supposed to laugh at the movie or not. As noted above, this was the result of an inappropriate soundtrack. This fact was not recognised by the producers, who went in the opposite direction, trying to match the movie to its soundtrack. They inserted the comic ""Eat me"" quote at the beginning, married the title caption to a shot of the hero vomiting, and presented the rest of the credits in a similarly ""zany"" way - they whoosh on and off the screen like exhibitionist skiers.This movie did not need sign-posts indicating ""wacky ironic subtext!"" What it needed was a dense orchestral score, a-la Jerry Goldsmith, to complement the eerie visuals and horrifying set pieces - amplifying this film's disturbing themes, not undermining them, and trusting the dark humour to look after itself. I don't anticipate anyone bothering to produce a suitable soundtrack, and reissue the film in a new, improved edition.

469005,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6305538948,Paperbackstash,"[1, 1]","An intriguing cannibal jamboree if there ever was one, Ravenous delivers a scrumptious tasteful little film I was more than happy to feast on. After the first five minutes I was left baffled on what to expect next. Comedic tones were already evident but I was hopeful the whole flick wouldn't be marinated in slapstick sauce. I was in the mood for brutality and thankfully I got what I craved.Although it did keep dishing out servings of laughter, Ravenous was also brutal as hell on the most primal of levels. The first half left me unsure whether to claim it as horror or not though. I ended up labeling this order as more of an action/horror than anything else.Cowardly but cute Captain John Boyd has been through some of the worst atrocities of human nature. He has seen war (Spanish-American Civil) and has no wish to lay his neck on the line any longer. Sent to Fort Spencer to room with 8 other folks (all men except for one), the trouble begins when a desperate man soon arrives at the little tucked away haven.Introducing himself in a mildly creepy manner, the man is captured and soon tells his frightening story. Deciding to go to the location the man speaks of and investigate, almost all leave (including the cowardly Boyd) and the fun really insues from here. A nifty twist takes hold, some creepy moments, and the tension jumps forth 100 notches full speed ahead.One interesting thing the script did was instead of cannibalism being simply gory and gut-munching...here the mythology is played up a bit. I don't want to let loose anything that would damper your tastes for this flick, so I'll keep my enthusiam in check for this part.Guy Pearce as the cowardly Boyd is excellent. The man's fear is actually amusing yet he is a serious guy. Not bad on the eyes, he plays his roles well and I really got into what he went through. Robert Carlysle steals the scenes. He's menacing, sophisticated, and creepy as a cannibal can get. The man has more faces than a compulsive liar, and he wears them all convincingly.Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones) is another favorite of mine as the man in charge. He's jolly with a great sense of humor and every scene with him was appetising. Private Reich, played by Neal McDonough, was also interesting but in a different way. The man was agressive yet I loved him. Wish he had more scenes though. David Arquette, who I generally don't care for, actually carried his own weight.Ravenous was full of dark forboding and great tense scenes. I actually felt some of the trapped feelings Boyd must have. Desperation really creeps in, and director Antonia Bird did an exceptional job. The music (David Albarn Michael Nyman) was a lot different than would be expected but it really worked.

Sure, there are cannibal films and there are vampire films, but how does one categorize Ravenous? Roger Ebert says it's a combination of both genres and I don't disagree, except Ravenous has a touch of ""biting"" humor. Beautifully filmed and edited, Ravenous takes place on the west side of the Sierra-Nevada mountains just after the First American Intervention of 1846-1848. Capt. John Boyd (played dryly and drolly by Guy Pearce) is reassigned to an outpost in the wilderness of California.Shortly after his arrival, a stranger, F.W. Colqhoun (played to the hilt by Robert Carlyle) stumbles into the outpost after having spent three months without food. Ha! ""but not without anything to eat"". What happens afterwards must be seen to believed. The supporting cast is strong, led by Jeffrey Jones (Deadwood, Amadeus) and Neal McDonough (Band of Brothers).

This movie is far, far from that in almost every aspect.  I can see it as a 3-star because of some things (like the generally failed comedic elements).  It could also be lowered by its slightly slow tempo, but I actually think that can be seen to work in this case.Clearly, though, if you don't like some blood and gore (but not pure slasher) and something a bit quirky, then you will probably not find the time spent watching to be worthwhile.

Yes, this is certainly one of the best movies to come out in recent years.  It bombed at the box office(naturally), though it only had a limited relesase in your local arthouse theater.  This movie is quite unique because it takes B movie subject matter and lifts it to the next level through great performances, writing and directing.  I guess you could say a B+ or A- movie.  It's always wonderful to have a movie like this sneak it's way onto screens among all the Hollywood &quot;horror&quot; garbage out there-LIKE REMAKES OF THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE AND SUCH!!!  The sad thing is, nobody will see this film unless they take a gamble at the video store or have a creepy friend into &quot;weird&quot; movies to suggest it to them.  This movie's one fun ride of gruesomness and dark humor.  In fact, for the first fifteen minutes you're unsure if the film's supposed to be a comedy or not, then you're slammed with some very intense violence.  The film puts a bit of the supernatural(for lack of a better word) into the whole cannibalism mythology-makes cannibalism part of Native american folklore.  A strange idea that eating human flesh can make you superhuman, heal injuries, and become addictive.  Far fetched for sure, but who knows?  Are you about to try and see if there's truth to that?  Do you hang out with cannibal tribes?  The two leads give two of the best performances of their careers but will never be recognized for it.  A pity.

Hill ""Owner of shillpages.com""","[10, 11]","What really makes this movie special is its originality - there are so few movies (horror ones especially) that take place in the early days of American colonial history. It's a bit surprising, as it's a setting that's  full of wild and mysterious opportunities for storytelling.But there's  more than just the unique setting. We have the concept of cannibalism  paired with a bit of soul vampirism, an Indian legend that appears to be  true, breathtaking scenery (shot in middle Europe, I believe) and some  extremely tense scenes. The acting is way above average, at least for  Robert Carlyle and Jeffrey Jones. Carlyle is especially haunting as the  catalyst of the story, going from near-death to a ragged bundle of nervous  energy to a calm and collected and impeccably attired officer.The DVD is  very well stuffed with extras - several commentaries, deleted scenes with  commentary, trailers, a nice section on set and costume design, and an  excellent transfer that helps us see that beautiful scenery I  mentioned.This is not the sort of movie you'd purchase without seeing  first, though - so I'd recommend a rental.

Earlier I had read some predominately bad reviews by the big name critics about Ravenous.  But I never base my opinions on what they  say, that it would be very narrow minded of me.  And being the film lover  that I am, the thought of passing up such a contraversial movie on mere  heresay seemed, well, stupid.  So what did I think?  Ravenous was  technically very well made, well scripted and well acted.  The story was  excellent, quite fresh and new.  I was disappointed only in the director's  complete misuse of camp.  The art of eating human flesh is, I'm quite sure,  probably grotesque in nature.  Perhaps that is what made the film is so  difficult to watch at times.  I'm not criticising that aspect, it's  everything else that distracted me.  Such as the scene in which Guy Pierce  kills Jeffery Jones' character.  The gore content peaked and really and  truly there was no need of it.  Horror classics such as the original Night  of the Living Dead which involved extreme canniblism in no way lowered  itself to campy effects.  So what am I saying?

This is especially true of _Ravenous_, a hybrid of the Western and the splatter flick.  Since I happen to enjoy both Westerns and splatter flicks, you'd think this would be my cup of tea.Nope.  Not even close.The biggest problem with _Ravenous_ is that it doesn't know it's cinematic trash.  Instead, the film attempts to offer an American history lesson.  Fat chance of getting any fascinating historical tidbits here, though.  History buffs will be quick to point out the film's ludicrous inaccuracies and anachronisms, starting with the design of the Army fort.  (This would probably be the best way for most viewers to remain awake, but why bother?)Meanwhile, the plot degenerates into a ham-handed, know-nothing message about Anglo-American conquest and domination of the West.  The insistent left-wing moralizing should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with director Antonia Bird's oeuvre.  In the end, _Ravenous_ comes across as self-important twaddle.  Worse, it's just plain dull.Western/horror hybrids have been doomed ever since Billy the Kid met Dracula, and this one's no exception.

The soundtrack is innovative and unconventional. It's minimalistic with repeated musical ideas that build on one another. It creates tension in suspenseful moments very effectively. In a climactic chase scene, the music may seem inappropriate, but not if the focus is on the gleeful predator instead of the fearful prey.When the film came out in 1999, it didn't do very well because of horrible marketing.

With this Cinematic Masterpiece, she has distanced herself from the  hackneyed pack, having crafted a grippingly intense and bizarrely original  film, that absolutely defies any attempt at pigeonholing or labeling it! A  Dark Comedy?  At times amusing, often deftly ironic, chillingly  irreverent, seemingly almost intentionally politically INcorrect, and  perhaps, ever so subtly feminist at the core...but certainly, ANYTHING BUT  FUNNY!Juxtapositioning, with flawless style and sobering  effectiveness, diverse elements of Horror, Period  Western,Action-Adventure,Psychodrama,Suspense and the Supernatural, against  a backdrop of some of the most breathtakingly dazzling outdoor scenery  imaginable,(Shot near Durango, Mexico)set to a perversely inspired musical  score that sould be utilized in Cinema production classes to highlight the  full potential of music to shape the ambience of a film and provide the  psychological equivalent of running your fingernails across a blackboard  during many scenes! Ms. Bird undoubtedly has a way with people! Other-  wise, how would she have managed to have coaxed such an array of truly  riveting performances from each and every member of a uniquely superb cast!  Guy Pearce(L.A.Confidential), starring as Captain Boyd, provided us with an  uncannily haunting por- trait of a tormented pacifistic soldier, in the  throws of a fierce struggle for his own soul! Robert Carlyle(Full  Monty/Trainspotting)was icily convincing as a fanatically focused, but  utterly deranged cannibal in uniform! Jeffrey Jones, in a oddly empathetic  change of pace role, played mild -mannered Colonel Hart,plagued by an  interminable list of human frailities, thusly,he is easily subverted by the  sinister Ives.(Carlyle) Despite all of the aforementioned accolades,I feel  I must offer a word of caution......Ravenous is undoubtedly NOT a film  suited to everyone's taste! Many have complained that it revels in scenes  of graphic gore...I, for one, totally disagree with these  observations.Compared to Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers,(Which I  consider to be an utter abomination!)Ravenous has scarcely a few mo- ments  of starkly violent or macabre footage! The difference is, seemingly, that  in Ravenous these moments seem so devastatingly repulsive, that they don't  go away easily. Perhaps this is the reaction Stone wanted to achieve in  Killers..but failed miserably in doing so!Consequently, I would  hesitate to throw out the Welcome Mat on this one!  Perhaps, if films like  2001: A Space Odyssey; The Shawshank Redemption; &amp; The English Patient  are among your favorites, Ravenous just might turn out to be one of the  most valued films in your collection!  However, if WATERBOY and ARMAGEDDON  (Although en- tertaining in their own predictable way!) are at the TOP of  your list....My money would be 10 to 1 against you on this one !

Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, and Jeffrey Jones are all in top form here, bringing these characters to life. The score is excellent, a creepy mix brewed up by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn. I've heard people say there are errors with the weendigo myth and how it is presented, but it's not covered in depth, just take it and run with it. Pearce plays the coward Capt. John Boyd, and he is excellent as usual. Carlyle as the cannibal Ives is creepy, and Jones offers up his usual humor with his character whose name slips me.

About the Native American legend of the Wendigo, a supernatural entity with an unsatiable appetite for human flesh.Robert Carlyle plays the Weendigo. He's a man who hears that consuming human flesh might restore his failing health, and decides to test the legend. With extraordinary and scary results. By eating human flesh he can recover from even the most fatal of wounds.Possessed by a ravenous appetite he turns up as the traumatized only survivor of a band of pioneers which elasped into horror, when they were snowed-in a cave, without food.Guy Pearce, plays Captain John Boyd, a soldier who served in the Mexican-American war of 1847, during battle he froze with fear and played dead, that way he was able to get behind enemy lines and take over from that side. He's given an award for bravery, but since the brass know about his cowardice he's sent, ashamed and haunted by nightmares to Fort Spencer in California, in cold February. The fort serves as a way station for travelers. At the fort there are only 8 people including Captain Boyd. Private Toffler (Jeremy Davies), who's the religious emissary at the fort, Major Knox (Stephen Spinella), who's dead drunk most of the time, Lieutenant Reich (Neal McDonough) who's kind of a crazed soldier/ rambo type,  2 Native Americans: Martha and her brother George (Sheila Tousey and Joseph Running Fox), Private Cleaves (David Arquette) who cooks and goofs off and Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones) who's in charge. On his first night, a mysterious traveler shows up, with a terrible tale of cannibalism. When they investigate, horror ensues.Excellent performances, wonderfrul script, beautiful cinematography, some fun dark humor. Robert Carlyle's fascinating in his characters transformation from supposedly traumatised survivor, to wild predator to super suave gentleman.

469039,A3VROBXAJDF6MA,6305538948,"""vincentarlock""","[40, 41]","Underrated, this is a hardcore, dark, macabre masterpiece. Guy Pearce (Captain John Boyd) is a soldier, who, though decorated, is actually a coward. After faking death in a battle against Mexicans, he is tossed among the dead in the enemy's encampment. He crawls out from a beneath a pile of oozing bodies and successfully takes the base from the enemy. His commander knows he isn't a real soldier and so, as he is disgusted by the sight of him but for politics sake can't reprimand him, the captain is sent to an isolated military outpost called Fort Spencer. Living there is a skeleton crew assisted by several indians and everything goes fine until a near dead man(Robert Carlyle) staggers into camp during the middle of a very cold winter. After being warmed up and fed, he tells a grisly tale of desperate cannibalism as he and the party he was traveling with got punished by the elements and were forced into a cave. A select small band soldiers and one indian set out to assist the remaining people in the cave, who by chance might just still be alive and so the movie truly begins. Nothing is quite what it seems as the twists and turns reveal the terrifying realities of the plot which eventually climax in a very satisfying and unexpected ending. The acting is excellent all around but especially with Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. The weak nature and mental struggles of Guy Pearce are incredibly believable and completely balance the innocent appearance yet sinister nature of Robert Carlyle. The cinematography creates a creepy, desolate atmosphere as the ingenious soundtrack(as good or better than that of Suspiria) by Damon Albarn and Michael Nyman truly fits ever scene and action, allowing for a true horror experience to be felt. With moments of twisted humor tastefully spread throughout, this is the total horror package and definitely not a movie to be rented...it should be purchased.",5,Wickedly Delicious!!!,999561600,"09 4, 2001",2001,1908,"['Underrated', 'hardcore', 'dark', 'macabre', 'masterpiece', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Captain', 'John', 'Boyd', 'soldier', 'who', 'though', 'decorated', 'actually', 'coward', 'faking', 'death', 'battle', 'Mexicans', 'tossed', 'dead', 'enemy', 'encampment', 'out', 'beneath', 'pile', 'oozing', 'bodies', 'successfully', 'base', 'enemy', 'commander', ""n't"", 'real', 'soldier', 'so', 'disgusted', 'sight', 'politics', 'sake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reprimand', 'captain', 'sent', 'isolated', 'military', 'outpost', 'called', 'Fort', 'Spencer', 'Living', 'skeleton', 'crew', 'assisted', 'several', 'indians', 'everything', 'fine', 'near', 'dead', 'man', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'staggers', 'camp', 'middle', 'very', 'cold', 'winter', 'being', 'warmed', 'up', 'fed', 'grisly', 'tale', 'desperate', 'cannibalism', 'party', 'was', 'traveling', 'got', 'punished', 'elements', 'were', 'forced', 'cave', 'select', 'small', 'band', 'soldiers', 'one', 'indian', 'set', 'out', 'assist', 'remaining', 'people', 'cave', 'who', 'chance', 'might', 'just', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'so', 'movie', 'truly', 'Nothing', 'quite', 'what', 'twists', 'reveal', 'terrifying', 'realities', 'plot', 'eventually', 'climax', 'very', 'satisfying', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'acting', 'excellent', 'all', 'especially', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'weak', 'nature', 'mental', 'struggles', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'are', 'incredibly', 'believable', 'completely', 'balance', 'innocent', 'appearance', 'yet', 'sinister', 'nature', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'cinematography', 'creepy', 'desolate', 'atmosphere', 'ingenious', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'better', 'Suspiria', 'Damon', 'Albarn', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'truly', 'fits', 'ever', 'scene', 'action', 'allowing', 'true', 'horror', 'experience', 'be', 'felt', 'moments', 'twisted', 'humor', 'tastefully', 'spread', 'total', 'horror', 'package', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'rented', 'should', 'be', 'purchased']",N/A

I remember seeing previews to this movie back when it was released, but forgot about it until i was digging around on a shelf at the store and saw it and said what the heck. Based arouond captain Boyd, a lieutenant at the time of the mexican-american war, who was awarded a medel of honor and promotion to captain after capturing a command post on his own.  Unfortunately, the secret he had was the fact that he was a coward, and actually got to the enemy camp as a coward. But something changed for him that day. Well, after his commander found out the truth, he was reassigned to a wilderness fort in the Sierra-nevada's of California, essentially a punishment assignment at a horrible, cold, isolated place.  While there, a stranger stumbles into camp, saying this wagon train got trapped in the mountain pass and they had to ended up ""resorting to the worst possible thing"" for food. The fort then sent boyd and a small party to find what was left of the wagon train, and it takes off from their.  It was definitely different than I thought it was going to be, i was thinking it was going to be a Donner party movie about survival, but it was more than that.  Some decent plot twist and turns. But, it just didn't hold me, in fact I have fallen asleep twice trying to rewatch it.  I just thought it was predictable for me.  It just seemed long at points, but oh well.
