943719,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B000BKDO6G,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[10, 13]","My response in one sentence: needed much more focus on *science*-particularly E=mc2- and less p.c. finger wagging and personal drama reenactments.The doc is called ""Einstein's Big Idea"" and we delve so much into personal matters and the personal problems of his predecessors. How 'bout more on the equation and how it was discovered and what uses it has been put to, as well as more analogies and descriptions to give the viewer an intuitive understanding?I'll say it is a fair documentary and especially good in dealing with the *personal issues of scientists*. It is not unfit for junior high and perhaps high school freshman (not ap classes).I bought this dvd to maybe get a little bit of an idea on what Einstein's work means--specifically that equation we've all heard of but most of us don't know anything about.Naturally, when creating a documentary the filmmakers want to dramatize things to make it a compelling story for people. And perhaps that might help people get through the science (Lol). You might say, ""well just watch a lecture next time if you don't want biography"". My reply to that would be I did want some biography, just done more intelligently, with more focus on the scientific work, and more sympathy for the hero of our tale. And sympathy to Einstein's predecessors but without the anachronistic moralizing, however subtle.So (if you'd like examples) we see Einstein's poor first wife nag him about his responsibilities to his family as he struggles to understand the Universe and specifically the nature of light. The poor woman, putting up with this self-centered man. And if you don't sense that when viewing scenes of the Einstein family in their humble home we then get an observation by one of the commentators that Einstein was selfish and tended to ignore everything except his work. And after Einstein gets recognition we are treated to a dramatic scene of him abandoning his family at a train station no less. We're told by narrator John Lithgow that Einstein divorced Mileva and married his cousin (No explanation is given but you know most people these days are disgusted, no?) as melancholic music plays.. and are informed that after achieving fame Einstein had many affairs. His first wife fades into the background, tears in her eyes, as Einstein rides away. The next image shows Einstein kicked back in his train cabin, content, with a pleased expression on his face.We want to understand the history and social pressures that these people endured. But I'd prefer to not see the disgusted expression of Emilie Chatelet's biographer when she sadly quotes Voltaire as saying of her, ""a great man whose only fault was being a woman"". It must have been so hard as a French Aristocrat and a woman interested in science! Think about it folks. French nobility as victim of sexism. Booo-hooo. And yet she was lovers with Volatire and multiple partners and did what she wanted. Try being a male French peasant and having the opportunity to do science! Lol. Yes, so not only do we get personal dramas but a feminist tale of oppression. Micheal Faraday had to overcome class divisions, we are shown, but in that case we're simply told this and shown him being at first dismissed by snooty English upperclassman. Seems that he had to go through a lot more than Chatelet but we instead are focused on his victory (and that's a good thing).3.5 stars",3,personal dramas surrounding E=mc2,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,3379,"['response', 'one', 'sentence', 'needed', 'much', 'more', 'focus', '*science*-particularly', 'E=mc2-', 'less', 'p.c', 'finger', 'wagging', 'personal', 'drama', 'reenactments.The', 'doc', 'called', 'Einstein', 'Big', 'Idea', 'delve', 'so', 'much', 'personal', 'matters', 'personal', 'problems', 'predecessors', 'How', ""'bout"", 'more', 'equation', 'how', 'was', 'discovered', 'what', 'been', 'put', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'analogies', 'descriptions', 'give', 'viewer', 'intuitive', 'understanding', ""'ll"", 'say', 'fair', 'documentary', 'especially', 'good', 'dealing', '*personal', 'issues', 'scientists*', 'not', 'unfit', 'junior', 'high', 'perhaps', 'high', 'school', 'freshman', 'not', 'ap', 'classes', '.I', 'bought', 'dvd', 'maybe', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'idea', 'what', 'Einstein', 'work', 'specifically', 'equation', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'about.Naturally', 'when', 'creating', 'documentary', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'dramatize', 'things', 'make', 'compelling', 'story', 'people', 'perhaps', 'might', 'help', 'people', 'get', 'science', 'Lol', 'might', 'say', 'well', 'just', 'watch', 'lecture', 'next', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'biography', 'reply', 'would', 'be', 'did', 'want', 'biography', 'just', 'done', 'more', 'intelligently', 'more', 'focus', 'scientific', 'work', 'more', 'sympathy', 'hero', 'tale', 'sympathy', 'Einstein', 'predecessors', 'anachronistic', 'moralizing', 'however', 'subtle.So', ""'d"", 'like', 'examples', 'see', 'Einstein', 'poor', 'first', 'wife', 'responsibilities', 'family', 'understand', 'Universe', 'specifically', 'nature', 'light', 'poor', 'woman', 'putting', 'up', 'self-centered', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'sense', 'when', 'viewing', 'scenes', 'Einstein', 'family', 'humble', 'home', 'then', 'get', 'observation', 'one', 'commentators', 'Einstein', 'was', 'selfish', 'tended', 'ignore', 'everything', 'work', 'Einstein', 'recognition', 'are', 'treated', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'abandoning', 'family', 'train', 'station', 'less', ""'re"", 'told', 'narrator', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Einstein', 'divorced', 'Mileva', 'married', 'cousin', 'explanation', 'given', 'know', 'most', 'people', 'days', 'are', 'disgusted', 'melancholic', 'music', 'plays..', 'are', 'informed', 'achieving', 'fame', 'Einstein', 'had', 'many', 'affairs', 'first', 'wife', 'fades', 'background', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Einstein', 'away', 'next', 'image', 'Einstein', 'kicked', 'back', 'train', 'cabin', 'content', 'pleased', 'expression', 'face.We', 'want', 'understand', 'history', 'social', 'pressures', 'people', 'endured', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'not', 'see', 'disgusted', 'expression', 'Emilie', 'Chatelet', 'biographer', 'when', 'sadly', 'Voltaire', 'saying', 'great', 'man', 'only', 'fault', 'was', 'being', 'woman', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'hard', 'French', 'Aristocrat', 'woman', 'interested', 'science', 'Think', 'French', 'nobility', 'victim', 'sexism', 'Booo-hooo', 'yet', 'was', 'lovers', 'Volatire', 'multiple', 'partners', 'did', 'what', 'wanted', 'Try', 'being', 'male', 'French', 'peasant', 'having', 'opportunity', 'do', 'science', 'Lol', 'Yes', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'personal', 'dramas', 'feminist', 'tale', 'oppression', 'Micheal', 'Faraday', 'had', 'overcome', 'class', 'divisions', 'are', 'shown', 'case', ""'re"", 'simply', 'told', 'shown', 'being', 'first', 'dismissed', 'snooty', 'English', 'upperclassman', 'had', 'go', 'lot', 'more', 'Chatelet', 'instead', 'are', 'focused', 'victory', 'good', 'thing', '.3.5', 'stars']",NOVA: Einstein's Big Idea

This film truly sets the standard for NOVa and makes me lament the fact that more programming isn't done like this.  If only the amount of money that goes into general programming went into PBS.  That would be something else.But enough of my own ridiculous desires.  EINSTEIN'S BIG IDEA chronicles some of the most fascinating scientific work that has been done in the last couple of centuries.  It is an idea so big that its implications have been vast, not just within the fields of science & mathematics, but in our society and culture at large.  NOVA also shows how Einstein's achievement was not the happy accident we often see it as.  Instead, this documentary seeks to situate his discovery by exploring the lives of other pioneers in related fields, richly filling out the personal lives of these scientists and, above all, situating their achievements in a rich history and context.In the end, EINSTEIN'S BIG IDEA accomplishes two goals.  First, I came away from the program with a bunch of ideas and information swimming in my head, the result of handing me the information in a digestible format.  Second, I was entertained throughout the entire program.  It truly didn't feel like I was learning--I was being entertained.If only I could go back and replace some of the boring school films I had to watch in middle/high school with the sharp work of NOVA.

943723,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000BKDO6G,Dennis Littrell,"[15, 16]","This is a 112-minute NOVA production directed by Gary Johnstone based on the book E=MC2 by David Bodanis.  John Lithgow narrates and Aiden McArdle stars as Albert Einstein.  It's the kind of documentary that melds interviews with scientists and historians with reconstructions of historical events by actors.  ""Einstein's Big Idea"" is a particularly good example of this genre.Bodanis realized when he conceived the book that it wasn't enough merely to write about Einstein.  It was necessary to bring Einstein's precursors and their ideas and discoveries into the mix.  This film does the same and does it well.  Recalled is the story of Michael Faraday who discovered electromagnetic induction and that of Antoine Lavoisier who demonstrated the conservation of matter.  Worth noting is the influence of women in these stories.  Shirley Henderson plays Einstein's first wife and fellow physicist Mileva Maric while Ty Glaser portrays Lavoisier's wife, Marie Anne, who was a fine chemist in her own right.  Included is the sad story of Lise Meitner, Austrian born Jewish physicist, who was betrayed by fellow physicist Otto Hahn in Nazi Germany in that he won a Nobel Prize in large part because of work she had done.What impressed me about this production was the fine acting by especially Shirley Henderson who is an outstanding actress, and Aiden McArdle who looked the spitting image of a young Albert Einstein.  Ty Glaser was also very good.  Johnstone's direction was first rate.  His ability to recreate various time periods in a realistic way should propel him toward a career adapting historical novels to the screen.The film concentrates on the personalities of the scientists and their struggles and successes.  The actual science is secondary.  Consequently this is a good film for people, especially young people, interested in science but without yet a lot of scientific training.",5,Fine dramatic depiction of the discoveries of Einstein and his precursors,1178582400,"05 8, 2007",2007,1894,"['112-minute', 'NOVA', 'production', 'directed', 'Gary', 'Johnstone', 'based', 'book', 'E=MC2', 'David', 'Bodanis', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'narrates', 'Aiden', 'McArdle', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'kind', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'scientists', 'historians', 'reconstructions', 'historical', 'events', 'actors', 'Einstein', 'Big', 'Idea', 'particularly', 'good', 'example', 'genre.Bodanis', 'realized', 'when', 'conceived', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'merely', 'write', 'Einstein', 'was', 'necessary', 'bring', 'Einstein', 'precursors', 'ideas', 'discoveries', 'mix', 'film', 'same', 'well', 'Recalled', 'story', 'Michael', 'Faraday', 'who', 'discovered', 'electromagnetic', 'induction', 'Antoine', 'Lavoisier', 'who', 'demonstrated', 'conservation', 'matter', 'noting', 'influence', 'women', 'stories', 'Shirley', 'Henderson', 'Einstein', 'first', 'wife', 'fellow', 'physicist', 'Mileva', 'Maric', 'Ty', 'Glaser', 'Lavoisier', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Anne', 'who', 'was', 'fine', 'chemist', 'own', 'right', 'Included', 'sad', 'story', 'Lise', 'Meitner', 'Austrian', 'Jewish', 'physicist', 'who', 'was', 'betrayed', 'fellow', 'physicist', 'Otto', 'Hahn', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'won', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'large', 'part', 'work', 'had', 'done.What', 'impressed', 'production', 'was', 'fine', 'acting', 'especially', 'Shirley', 'Henderson', 'who', 'outstanding', 'actress', 'Aiden', 'McArdle', 'who', 'looked', 'spitting', 'image', 'young', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'Ty', 'Glaser', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Johnstone', 'direction', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'ability', 'recreate', 'various', 'time', 'periods', 'realistic', 'way', 'should', 'propel', 'career', 'adapting', 'historical', 'novels', 'screen.The', 'film', 'concentrates', 'personalities', 'scientists', 'struggles', 'successes', 'actual', 'science', 'secondary', 'Consequently', 'good', 'film', 'people', 'especially', 'young', 'people', 'interested', 'science', 'yet', 'lot', 'scientific', 'training']",NOVA: Einstein's Big Idea

Although Einstein's E=mc^2 is the central role, related science evolution and stories of other scientists are well covered, too. Einstein's part only shares about one third of the total run time.The arrangement is quite innovative. In the famous equation R=mc^2, E means energy and it brings up Michael Faraday and his story. In fact, people at that time think it in terms of powers or forces, not energies. Faraday proposed the force lines and explained the electromagnetism. In addition, m is the mass and Lavoisier is introduced for his discovery on law of conservation of mass. Due to his roles as tax collectors in Paris, he was executed after the French Revolution. Last, c means the velocity of light and James Clerk Maxwell is on the stage. He proved that light is a form of electromagnetic waves based on his excellent mathematical skill, which Faraday is lack of.Other scientists and their contributions are also mentioned in this DVD. The background of their times, passion for the work, discrimination against female, betrayal, politics and even romance (well, maybe not so romantic) are included so that this film is quite colorful. Sadly, a good scientist usually accompanied with a bad marriage. Moreover, what seems to stand firmly today evolved a long time, one hundred years for example, for people or even scientists to accept.Overall, this film documents certain part of the evolution of science.

How he determined that light is electromagnetic in nature and its relation to time is key.  The documentary is a combination of connections between discoveries that mature across four centuries.  Each seem isolated, but build to the point that leads to the ultimate power of the atom.  Einstein is the right person in the right place at the right time to bring the discoveries together with great insight.  Just as Carl Sagan has said, it comes down to the fact that the earth and everything on it, including all life, is made of stardust.How a complicated theory captures the simple fact that energy, light, and matter are one in the same is exquisite detective work.
