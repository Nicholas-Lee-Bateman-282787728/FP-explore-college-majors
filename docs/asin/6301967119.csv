278515,A1LPBAFE1HZXTB,6301967119,abqbeach,"[6, 6]","The Children's Hour was quite a daring film for its time and is based on Lillian Hellman's play of the same name, the first show on Broadway to deal with the subject of lesbianism when it was a success in the 1930s.Karen (Audrey Hepburn) and Martha (Shirley MacLaine) are good friends and run a boarding school for girls. Karen is dating Joe (James Garner) and agrees to marry him, upsetting Martha in the process. Martha's aunt tells her that her jealousy is unnatural.Enter super brat Mary (Karen Balkin), one of the students who has just been disciplined for not telling the truth. She lies and elaborates to her grandmother about the conversation between Martha and her aunt, telling her about late night visits and kisses between the two women and putting into motion accusations that Martha and Karen are lovers having ""sinful sexual knowledge of one another.""The ending is predictable for a film about lesbians made in this era. Martha feels sick and dirty by a society that tells her she is so. The last five minutes of the film are tough to watch, since we know what's coming. It's the kind of thing that makes me sick and angry to see, but I recommend watching this film for two reasons: understanding the realities and attitudes of the time and getting a good cry over those who still might have to deal with such feelings; and MacLaine's performance.*See Shirley MacLaine's 1995 interview in The Celluloid Closet.

278517,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,6301967119,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[3, 3]","This 1961 melodrama tackles the daring (for then) subject of lesbianism between two teachers, and what happens when whispers of it reach the ears of a small town public. For all it's datedness (which isn't actually very much), the situation could be re-filmed quite successfully even today without much need for changing a lot of the details. Due to the good performances, it still stands as a film worthy of your attention.The two teachers in question are Martha (Shirley MacLaine) and Karen (Audrey Hepburn), who run a small school for girls which has just started to flourish. Karen has a long standing fiance, while all that Martha has is a washed out old actress of an aunt. But they both have each other, and have become close friends - which unfortunately is the very thing that starts off the trouble.If you are unfamiliar with the plot, you should find this film entertaining. You will find out early on that the gossip about the two women is started by a particularly obnoxious girl at school who decides to get back at the two teachers for punishing her spoilt ways. The havoc that the child manages to cause is quite well documented and carries the film through from it's half way mark right until the end. I won't tell you any more about the plot, as it's much more rewarding to watch the film unprepared, although I will say that the general air of doom and gloom does seem to be laid on with a trowel at some points, but in fairness this is simply down to the time the film was made. Even so, you can still sympathise with the two women as the plight they are in is still relevant enough even by modern standards. However, I predict that you will be rolling your eyes at certain aspects of the film that probably wouldn't be filmed the same way now, such as the discreet hushed whispering, or a convenient ""out of earshot"" positioning for certain conversations, and even the very obvious closing of a door whenever the topic of what the two women actually ""did"" ever gets mentioned. Phrases such as ""in my room"" and ""late at night"" take on huge gravity, and it would be rather easy to poke fun at the level of horror that is evoked by the accusations, but the film luckily manages to keep it's dignity for most of the time, and to keep your interest up at all times.As I mentioned, the performances are all very good, notably from the two leads of course, but also from the whole cast, with special mention for the young actress who plays the vile brat Mary who makes up the lies in the first place. And there's a great turn from a young Veronica Cartright (from ""The Birds"") who plays a more timid child, also caught up in the web of deceit. The film also looks very good, in lovely crisp black and white, although I did find a few scene edits very odd when instead of cutting away and back again, the film occasionally just cut parts of the same angle together so that scenes seemed to be jumping frames. I did have a few reservations towards the end of the film as the script seems to be saying (albeit sympathetically) that to be a lesbian is to be doomed rather than accepted, and at times it was hard to fathom how the two leads characters were supposed to be reacting to the central topic. More than anything else, the closing shot of one of the lead actresses walking away from the final scene left me totally clueless about her character's reaction to what forms the (very important) climax to the film. Too much unsaid here (and I do mean explicitly in the script) makes me think the film shied away from being as sympathetic as it should have been here. I can't explain what I mean without giving away huge spoilers, but if you feel unsatisfied by the film at all, I would wager this last scene would have a lot to do with it.But to sum up, the film is as much about a well-created lie from a child managing to poison their lives of innocent adults as it is about the subject of the lie itself. The fact that the lie is such a juicy and forbidden topic for a serious film of 1961 like this is what makes ""The Children's Hour"" a remarkable tale. Try and consider the plight of these two women in the time that the film was written rather than now, and you may be able to immerse yourself in what is actually a pretty good drama.",3,Effective drama,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,4253,"['1961', 'melodrama', 'daring', 'then', 'subject', 'lesbianism', 'two', 'teachers', 'what', 'when', 'whispers', 'ears', 'small', 'town', 'public', 'datedness', ""n't"", 'actually', 'very', 'much', 'situation', 'could', 'be', 're-filmed', 'quite', 'successfully', 'even', 'today', 'much', 'need', 'changing', 'lot', 'details', 'Due', 'good', 'performances', 'still', 'film', 'worthy', 'attention.The', 'two', 'teachers', 'question', 'are', 'Martha', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Karen', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'run', 'small', 'school', 'girls', 'just', 'started', 'flourish', 'Karen', 'long', 'standing', 'fiance', 'Martha', 'washed', 'out', 'old', 'actress', 'aunt', 'have', 'other', 'have', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'thing', 'trouble.If', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'plot', 'should', 'find', 'film', 'entertaining', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'early', 'gossip', 'two', 'women', 'started', 'particularly', 'obnoxious', 'girl', 'school', 'who', 'get', 'back', 'two', 'teachers', 'punishing', 'spoilt', 'ways', 'havoc', 'child', 'cause', 'quite', 'well', 'documented', 'film', 'half', 'way', 'mark', 'right', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'film', 'unprepared', 'will', 'say', 'general', 'air', 'doom', 'gloom', 'seem', 'be', 'laid', 'trowel', 'points', 'fairness', 'simply', 'down', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Even', 'so', 'can', 'still', 'sympathise', 'two', 'women', 'plight', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'enough', 'even', 'modern', 'standards', 'However', 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'filmed', 'same', 'way', 'now', 'such', 'discreet', 'hushed', 'whispering', 'convenient', 'earshot', 'positioning', 'certain', 'conversations', 'even', 'very', 'obvious', 'closing', 'door', 'whenever', 'topic', 'what', 'two', 'women', 'actually', 'did', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'Phrases', 'such', 'room', 'late', 'night', 'take', 'huge', 'gravity', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'easy', 'poke', 'fun', 'level', 'horror', 'evoked', 'accusations', 'film', 'luckily', 'keep', 'dignity', 'most', 'time', 'keep', 'interest', 'up', 'times.As', 'mentioned', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'notably', 'two', 'leads', 'course', 'also', 'whole', 'cast', 'special', 'mention', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'vile', 'brat', 'Mary', 'who', 'up', 'lies', 'first', 'place', 'great', 'turn', 'young', 'Veronica', 'Cartright', 'Birds', 'who', 'more', 'timid', 'child', 'also', 'caught', 'up', 'web', 'deceit', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'lovely', 'crisp', 'black', 'white', 'did', 'find', 'few', 'scene', 'edits', 'very', 'odd', 'when', 'instead', 'cutting', 'away', 'back', 'again', 'film', 'occasionally', 'just', 'cut', 'parts', 'same', 'angle', 'together', 'so', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'be', 'jumping', 'frames', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'reservations', 'end', 'film', 'script', 'be', 'saying', 'sympathetically', 'be', 'lesbian', 'be', 'doomed', 'rather', 'accepted', 'times', 'was', 'hard', 'fathom', 'how', 'two', 'leads', 'characters', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'reacting', 'central', 'topic', 'More', 'anything', 'else', 'closing', 'shot', 'one', 'lead', 'walking', 'away', 'final', 'scene', 'left', 'totally', 'clueless', 'character', 'reaction', 'what', 'very', 'important', 'climax', 'film', 'Too', 'much', 'unsaid', 'here', 'do', 'mean', 'explicitly', 'script', 'think', 'film', 'shied', 'away', 'being', 'as', 'sympathetic', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'what', 'mean', 'giving', 'away', 'huge', 'spoilers', 'feel', 'unsatisfied', 'film', 'would', 'wager', 'last', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'it.But', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'well-created', 'lie', 'child', 'managing', 'poison', 'lives', 'innocent', 'adults', 'subject', 'lie', 'fact', 'lie', 'such', 'juicy', 'forbidden', 'topic', 'serious', 'film', '1961', 'what', 'Children', 'Hour', 'remarkable', 'tale', 'Try', 'consider', 'plight', 'two', 'women', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'rather', 'now', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'immerse', 'what', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'drama']",N/A

278522,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301967119,Andrew Ellington,"[18, 18]","This is one of those movies I didn't expect to hit me the way that it did.  I love Hepburn and MacLaine and so I was anticipating finally getting to sit down and watch this film, but I truly had no idea what to expect.  Hepburn was such a wonderfully light actress, an actress who filtered in and out of breezy comedies with such effortless charisma, so I was expecting something a little less dramatic and little more entertaining.  What I got instead was one of those films that socks you in the gut and leaves you pondering issues and consequences that never seem to leave your head afterward.`The Children's Hour' is haunting.The film tells the story of Karen Wright and Martha Dobie, two young women who run a boarding school for young girls.  Little Mary Tilford is quite the troublemaker and is constantly finding herself in trouble, and this moves her to tell a little lie (or more like a major embellishment) in order to free herself of trouble.  This lie spreads quickly and threatens to destroy the lives of Karen and Martha.What is so amazing and in the end captivating about `The Children's Hour' is that it never becomes predictable but from beginning to end keeps the audience in anticipation.  The relationship between Karen and Martha is a huge question mark to the audience, which helps with our understanding of the lie, and this also keeps us wondering how much validity there is to the accusation.  This is a brilliant tactic used to keep the audience hooked, and it works on all levels.Thanks to some brilliant acting as well, `The Children's Hour' skyrockets to the top of the pack, delivering a very heartfelt and moving drama about deception and regret.  Audrey Hepburn floored me with her ability to retain her screen charm while attacking a character that is so unlike the darlings she usually played.  Karen is deeply bothered by her predicament, and her emotional distress is brought to life by Hepburn's masterful performance.  As good as Audrey was though, MacLaine was ten times better.  The character of Martha is definitely the most interesting, especially in the final act, and Shirley's character development is essential to the last impression made by the film.  I was blown away by her ability to create a character that was so likable and so infectious while never losing her dark secrets and guilt ridden conscience.  You felt the revelations before they were revealed, yet she never gave them away too early; and that takes talent.The supporting performances are also wonderful.  James Garner is impressive as Joe, Karen's fianc&eacute;, but this movie uses him more as a prop than anything else.  Fay Bainter received an Oscar nomination for her performance, and rightfully so, for her devilish mix of inhumanity and uncompromising maternal love is outstanding.  Young Karen Balkin is perfect as Mary, the young child you love to hate.In the end `The Children's Hour' is a brilliant character study on the after effects of the lie.  The final twist of the knife will leave you breathless, speechless and broken, but it's that final twist that elevates the film drastically and makes it such an important masterpiece.  This may very well be Hepburn's finest film and this may very well sport MacLaine's finest performance; two reasons right there to see this movie immediately.",5,Further proof that there is no such thing as a harmless lie...,1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,3318,"['one', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hit', 'way', 'did', 'love', 'Hepburn', 'MacLaine', 'so', 'was', 'anticipating', 'finally', 'getting', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'truly', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'such', 'wonderfully', 'light', 'actress', 'actress', 'who', 'filtered', 'breezy', 'comedies', 'such', 'effortless', 'charisma', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'little', 'less', 'dramatic', 'little', 'more', 'entertaining', 'What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'socks', 'gut', 'pondering', 'issues', 'consequences', 'never', 'seem', 'leave', 'head', 'afterward.', 'Children', 'Hour', 'haunting.The', 'film', 'story', 'Karen', 'Wright', 'Martha', 'Dobie', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'run', 'boarding', 'school', 'young', 'girls', 'Little', 'Mary', 'Tilford', 'quite', 'troublemaker', 'constantly', 'finding', 'trouble', 'tell', 'little', 'lie', 'more', 'major', 'embellishment', 'order', 'free', 'herself', 'trouble', 'lie', 'spreads', 'quickly', 'destroy', 'lives', 'Karen', 'Martha.What', 'so', 'amazing', 'end', 'captivating', 'Children', 'Hour', 'never', 'predictable', 'beginning', 'end', 'keeps', 'audience', 'anticipation', 'relationship', 'Karen', 'Martha', 'huge', 'question', 'mark', 'audience', 'understanding', 'lie', 'also', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'validity', 'accusation', 'brilliant', 'tactic', 'used', 'keep', 'audience', 'hooked', 'levels.Thanks', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'Children', 'Hour', 'skyrockets', 'top', 'pack', 'delivering', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'moving', 'drama', 'deception', 'regret', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'floored', 'ability', 'retain', 'screen', 'charm', 'attacking', 'character', 'so', 'darlings', 'usually', 'played', 'Karen', 'deeply', 'bothered', 'predicament', 'emotional', 'distress', 'brought', 'life', 'Hepburn', 'masterful', 'performance', 'As', 'good', 'Audrey', 'was', 'MacLaine', 'was', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'character', 'Martha', 'definitely', 'most', 'interesting', 'especially', 'final', 'act', 'Shirley', 'character', 'development', 'essential', 'last', 'impression', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'ability', 'create', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'likable', 'so', 'infectious', 'never', 'losing', 'dark', 'secrets', 'guilt', 'ridden', 'conscience', 'felt', 'revelations', 'were', 'revealed', 'yet', 'never', 'gave', 'away', 'too', 'early', 'talent.The', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'wonderful', 'James', 'Garner', 'impressive', 'Joe', 'Karen', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'movie', 'more', 'prop', 'anything', 'else', 'Fay', 'Bainter', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'rightfully', 'so', 'devilish', 'mix', 'inhumanity', 'uncompromising', 'maternal', 'love', 'outstanding', 'Young', 'Karen', 'Balkin', 'perfect', 'Mary', 'young', 'child', 'love', 'hate.In', 'end', 'Children', 'Hour', 'brilliant', 'character', 'study', 'effects', 'lie', 'final', 'twist', 'knife', 'will', 'leave', 'breathless', 'speechless', 'broken', 'final', 'twist', 'film', 'drastically', 'such', 'important', 'masterpiece', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'Hepburn', 'finest', 'film', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'sport', 'MacLaine', 'finest', 'performance', 'two', 'reasons', 'right', 'there', 'see', 'movie', 'immediately']",N/A
278523,AD84ZN1ZQBSSH,6301967119,Angie,"[5, 6]","Like much of the lesbian pulp fiction of the 1950s, ""The Children's Hour"" comes from that era when homosexuality was considered the ""worst evil of all."" I'm not sure if William Wyler meant to or not, but in this film the director finds a surprising sympathy for his main character Martha. Despite its emphasis on the supposed lesbianism of the two leads, ""The Children's Hour"" is not really a story about being gay. Instead it focuses (or tries to) on how one bad little girl can ruin two adults's lives forever simply by opening her mouth.With relative restraint rather than melodrama, Wyler illustrates the power of a child's words. A student at the boarding school ""Karen"" (Audrey Hepburn) and ""Martha"" (Shirley MacLaine) run, ""Mary"" (Karen Balkin) spreads malicious rumors (are there any other kind?). On the surface these rumors aren't true, but as things progress and Karen and Martha interact in their strong friendship and professional partnership, we see that Martha may indeed have ""unnatural"" feelings for her best friend.Things reach a fevered pitch as Mary's grandmother takes action and decides Karen and Martha are not to fit to run a school for young girls. Legal action is taken, careers are destroyed and a friendship that once was fun and light-hearted is  now fraught with tension.I don't like to reveal endings to movies, so I won't do that here. All I WILL say is that Shirley MacLaine gives the performance of her life as she unravels emotionally, devastated at what is happening around and inside her. Filmed during a time when gays and lesbians were treated as criminals and freaks, ""The Children's Hour"" is not as harsh as it could have been. Some people would probably call Wyler's film unfashionably dated, but the sad truth is it's coming back in style now that we are slowly returning to an era that demonizes gays and lesbians and won't let them have a happy ending.",5,I hear a  sympathy,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,1897,"['much', 'lesbian', 'pulp', 'fiction', '1950s', 'Children', 'Hour', 'era', 'when', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'considered', 'worst', 'evil', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'William', 'Wyler', 'meant', 'not', 'film', 'director', 'surprising', 'sympathy', 'main', 'character', 'Martha', 'emphasis', 'supposed', 'lesbianism', 'two', 'leads', 'Children', 'Hour', 'not', 'really', 'story', 'being', 'gay', 'Instead', 'tries', 'how', 'one', 'bad', 'little', 'girl', 'can', 'ruin', 'two', 'adults', 'lives', 'forever', 'simply', 'opening', 'mouth.With', 'relative', 'restraint', 'rather', 'melodrama', 'Wyler', 'power', 'child', 'words', 'student', 'boarding', 'school', 'Karen', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Martha', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'run', 'Mary', 'Karen', 'Balkin', 'malicious', 'rumors', 'are', 'there', 'other', 'kind', 'surface', 'rumors', 'are', ""n't"", 'true', 'things', 'progress', 'Karen', 'Martha', 'interact', 'strong', 'friendship', 'professional', 'partnership', 'see', 'Martha', 'may', 'indeed', 'have', 'unnatural', 'feelings', 'best', 'friend.Things', 'reach', 'fevered', 'pitch', 'Mary', 'grandmother', 'action', 'Karen', 'Martha', 'are', 'not', 'fit', 'run', 'school', 'young', 'girls', 'Legal', 'action', 'taken', 'careers', 'are', 'destroyed', 'friendship', 'once', 'was', 'fun', 'light-hearted', 'now', 'fraught', 'tension.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reveal', 'endings', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'here', 'WILL', 'say', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'performance', 'life', 'emotionally', 'devastated', 'what', 'happening', 'around', 'Filmed', 'time', 'when', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'were', 'treated', 'criminals', 'freaks', 'Children', 'Hour', 'not', 'as', 'harsh', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'call', 'Wyler', 'film', 'unfashionably', 'dated', 'sad', 'truth', 'coming', 'back', 'style', 'now', 'are', 'slowly', 'returning', 'era', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A

The seemingly far-fetched plot from a play by Lillian Hellman gets frighteningly realistic under the sure hand of director William Wyler (Ben Hur, Funny Girl, Best Years of Our Lives). Audrey Hepburn gives an understated, graceful performance as one co-owner and teacher of the school, Shirley MacLaine is laconic and bitter as the other.

Many will call the performance ""overacting"". There are scenes that call for big chops. But there are also subtle shades peppered through the film, like when she is told that God will punish her, and she just mutters ""He's doing all right."" MacLaine is one of several very powerful actors of that period, including Suzanne Pleshette, who never got the right script that was a showcase for their untapped talent.I have never hated a child character moreso than nasty little Mary. Horrid Mary with the weird face. I wanted to see her suffer, to see her get a comeuppance. (I can only hope that creepy grandma really slugged her good, or yanked a big chunk of hair from her skull...but we are cheated by a dissolve to the next scene. Nuts.)I loathed Mary much more than the girl in ""The Bad Seed"" because that pigtailed psycho wasn't ""real"" to me; however, there are lots of Marys in this world, walking around right now, lying, bullying, sneaking, scheming, whispering, and screaming.The film's ending is too melodramatic and unrealistic. What, in that time if you had those feelings you'd have to end it all? This is what Hollywood was telling its audience. Scary. Maybe that's why so many young adults who were coming to terms with their true identities attempted suicide. I don't really get what Hellmann was trying to say. Are we to feel pity or sympathy here? Are gay people abnormal misfits? I don't know if the play was different from the film, having never read it.I just hate the movie's ending.And the scene where Hepburn runs back toward the house (the strange cutting with different angles of her running) is extremely distracting. The director reminds you that you are watching a film, and it takes away from your involvement in the drama. And it's the most powerful scene in the movie! There are very few cinematic ""tricks"" in the film, but this one stands out like a sore thumb.I found the last shot of Hepburn walking away with a detatched, confident expression to be very odd.

But these difficulties only foreshadowed other structural problems. A MAJOR portion of the drama is missing: the courtroom drama was completely circumvented! And then the doting and melodramatic ending, the loss of love, and the peculiar depression of the characters even in the face of their ultimate victory...I don't buy it.

This was not the play at all, and the performances are not that good.William Wyler directed the 30;s version, and so he directs this version, so much better and very very close to the play.Shirley MaClaine thinks that her role was watered down, and that Lesbians do not behave this way. Ms. Hepburn thought that it was very much to the point, and considered it a personal triumph, because of MaClaine's interaction with her. Hepburn is right, and the film builds to a climactic finish not seen in films of this genre, then or now.This film also opens up the whole homophobic insanity with Garner and Miriam Hopkins and Fay  Bainter. It suggests that gay people will teach children the ways of gays, and therefore they(Audrey and Shirley must be stopped, school closed etc.). Dated? Can anyone imagine this happening today? The women are chareged with sexual activity by a young girl who gets others in on the accusations, not the least her powerful grand mother. Then, bad, today a disaster.

278536,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6301967119,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[41, 52]","What the maliciously whispered lies of one nasty little kid can do!  What can it do?  I recall Malcolm McDowell's character in if... saying how one bullet in the right place could change the world.  Well, something similar happens here, only the world that is shattered results in the discrediting of three innocent people.Mary is an aggressive troublemaker at the Wright-Dobie School For Girls, run by Karen Wright and Martha Dobie, women who graduated from college together.  The school's actually a large two-story house where the children sleep upstairs and have classes downstairs.  Mary lies, steals, blackmails, and even overracts just to get out of trouble.  Karen, who has been patient with her, finally decides to punish her, and that's when Mary decides to act.  She uses gossip she hears from other girls, blackmails a girl with a penchant for stealing, but the second worst thing she does is manipulate her caring but strict grandmother, Ms. Amelia Tilford, into being the agent for the destruction of innocent lives.  It is Tilford's spreading the lie of the schoolteachers being lovers that causes the school to collapse.For the two women, assisted by Martha's meddlesome aunt Lily Mortar, running a school's not easy, but things are looking up.  They've finally made a profit, expecting some more students, and Joe Cardon, the local doctor and cousin of Mary's, has finally agreed on a date to marry Karen.  All this though has been surrounded by tensions.  Joe has been snappish, Martha is a bit sharp with Joe, and everybody's tired from running this school.  And tensions boil when Lily berates Martha for being possessive and jealous of Karen to the point that Martha dismisses her own aunt from the school.  But the scandal brings with it the mind-twisting madness of how certain words spoken have a different connotation.  ""Everything I say is meant to mean something else,"" Joe says in frustration.  To which Karen says, ""Every word has a new meaning.  Child, love, friend, woman...not many safe words anymore.""The darkly lit interior scenes in the empty schoolhouse, once bustling with activity, mirrors the somber atmosphere after the scandal breaks.  Based on Lillian Hellman's play on an actual incident in early 19th century Scotland, and initially filmed in 1936 under the title These Three, and also directed by William Wyler, it was a perfect opportunity to test the waters of the newly liberated Production Code, but the word ""lesbian"" was never used, mainly because Hepburn was nervous about content.  There were some scenes that played up on a potential relationship that were cut, and Shirley MacLaine regretted that Wyler didn't keep the ball rolling in that regard.  As a result, it's not the film it could have been.The stars are all good, with even James Garner showing some emotional depth when things between Joe and Karen finally become strained as a result of the scandal.  Miriam Hopkins, who played Martha Dobie in These Three, plays the role originally done by Catherine Doucet.  Audrey is laudable enough here, but for her, saying no to Wyler, who directed her to fame in Roman Holiday, was tantamount to saying no to God, otherwise, she probably wouldn't have come out in this.  But Fay Bainter (Ms. Tilford) turns in a role for which she was given a Best Supporting Actress nomination, as someone concerned, and too trusting to be blinded from the truth.  When it does hit her, there is a scene when she collapses.  She shrugs off any assistance, rises, and stares imperiously while her granddaughter stares in fear at being finally revealed.While not one of Hepburn's most memorable movies, it's certainly one of the most depressing, and thus seems longer than it's 1:47 running time.",3,What the loudest whisper can do...,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,3734,"['What', 'maliciously', 'whispered', 'lies', 'one', 'nasty', 'little', 'kid', 'can', 'do', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'recall', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'character', 'saying', 'how', 'one', 'bullet', 'right', 'place', 'could', 'change', 'world', 'Well', 'something', 'similar', 'happens', 'here', 'only', 'world', 'shattered', 'results', 'discrediting', 'three', 'innocent', 'people.Mary', 'aggressive', 'troublemaker', 'Wright-Dobie', 'School', 'Girls', 'run', 'Karen', 'Wright', 'Martha', 'Dobie', 'women', 'who', 'graduated', 'college', 'together', 'school', 'actually', 'large', 'two-story', 'house', 'where', 'children', 'sleep', 'upstairs', 'have', 'classes', 'downstairs', 'Mary', 'steals', 'blackmails', 'even', 'overracts', 'just', 'get', 'trouble', 'Karen', 'who', 'been', 'patient', 'finally', 'punish', 'when', 'Mary', 'act', 'gossip', 'other', 'girls', 'girl', 'penchant', 'stealing', 'second', 'worst', 'thing', 'manipulate', 'caring', 'strict', 'grandmother', 'Ms.', 'Amelia', 'Tilford', 'being', 'agent', 'destruction', 'innocent', 'lives', 'Tilford', 'spreading', 'lie', 'schoolteachers', 'being', 'lovers', 'school', 'collapse.For', 'two', 'women', 'assisted', 'Martha', 'meddlesome', 'aunt', 'Lily', 'Mortar', 'running', 'school', 'not', 'easy', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'up', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'made', 'profit', 'expecting', 'more', 'students', 'Joe', 'Cardon', 'local', 'doctor', 'cousin', 'Mary', 'finally', 'agreed', 'date', 'marry', 'Karen', 'though', 'been', 'surrounded', 'tensions', 'Joe', 'been', 'snappish', 'Martha', 'bit', 'sharp', 'Joe', 'everybody', 'tired', 'running', 'school', 'tensions', 'boil', 'when', 'Lily', 'Martha', 'being', 'possessive', 'jealous', 'Karen', 'point', 'Martha', 'own', 'aunt', 'school', 'scandal', 'mind-twisting', 'madness', 'how', 'certain', 'words', 'spoken', 'have', 'different', 'connotation', 'Everything', 'say', 'meant', 'mean', 'something', 'else', 'Joe', 'frustration', 'Karen', 'word', 'new', 'meaning', 'Child', 'love', 'friend', 'woman', 'not', 'many', 'safe', 'words', 'anymore', 'darkly', 'lit', 'interior', 'scenes', 'empty', 'schoolhouse', 'once', 'bustling', 'activity', 'somber', 'atmosphere', 'scandal', 'breaks', 'Based', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', 'play', 'actual', 'incident', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'Scotland', 'initially', 'filmed', '1936', 'title', 'Three', 'also', 'directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'was', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'test', 'waters', 'newly', 'liberated', 'Production', 'Code', 'word', 'lesbian', 'was', 'never', 'used', 'mainly', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'nervous', 'content', 'were', 'scenes', 'played', 'up', 'potential', 'relationship', 'were', 'cut', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'regretted', 'Wyler', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'ball', 'rolling', 'regard', 'result', 'not', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been.The', 'stars', 'are', 'good', 'even', 'James', 'Garner', 'showing', 'emotional', 'depth', 'when', 'things', 'Joe', 'Karen', 'finally', 'become', 'strained', 'result', 'scandal', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'played', 'Martha', 'Dobie', 'Three', 'role', 'originally', 'done', 'Catherine', 'Doucet', 'Audrey', 'laudable', 'enough', 'here', 'saying', 'Wyler', 'who', 'directed', 'fame', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'was', 'tantamount', 'saying', 'God', 'otherwise', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'out', 'Fay', 'Bainter', 'Ms.', 'Tilford', 'role', 'was', 'given', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'someone', 'concerned', 'too', 'trusting', 'be', 'blinded', 'truth', 'When', 'hit', 'scene', 'when', 'shrugs', 'off', 'assistance', 'imperiously', 'granddaughter', 'stares', 'fear', 'being', 'finally', 'not', 'one', 'Hepburn', 'most', 'memorable', 'movies', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'depressing', 'thus', 'longer', '1:47', 'running', 'time']",N/A

278542,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301967119,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[139, 142]","Written and first staged in the 1930s, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR was master playwright Lillian Helman's first great success.  It also provoked a scandal: the story concerned two women who run a school for girls--and who suffer scandal and personal tragedy when an unruly student accuses them of having a lesbian affair. The play was such a success that Hollywood wasted little time in buying the film rights, but the material was too hot for the 1930s film industry; the story was significantly rewritten into a fairly insipid love-triangle melodrama and was released under the title THESE THREE.  It would be another thirty years before American film was ready to tackle the play head on.Many critics have noted that THE CHILDREN'S HOUR is not about lesbianism, but about the power of a lie.  There is some truth to this, for the entire plot rests on the child's lie and its devasting effect.  But Helman was not a superficial writer: once the knife goes in, she twists it several times, first in a series of emotional revelations between the leading characters and finally in a portrait of society that attacks any one perceived as different in any way--even to the point of driving them to death.  Some complain that this is merely another Hollywood stereotype in which the gay character has to be punished by the film's conclusion, but I disagree; if anything, Helman's point remains as unfortunately valid today as it was in the 1930s and again in the 1960s.The cast ranges from solid to exceptional, and the supporting cast is exceptionally fine.  Fay Bainter and Mirian Hopkins, both legendary actresses, give truly memorable performances in supporting roles; child actresses Karen Balkin and Veronica Cartwright also give remarkably powerful performances.  And Audrey Hepburn and James Garner are rock solid as school teacher Karen Wright and her beau Dr. Cardin.  But the raw power of the film comes from Shirley MacLaine, who gives one of the most inspired performances of her career as school teacher Martha Dobie.  In this case superlatives are not enough: no one who sees the film will easily forget her tortured, passionate performance.

278544,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,6301967119,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[4, 4]","*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!*This is one of my most favorite movies ever. It is also probably my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie. In fact, it is probably the movie that made me a fan of Audrey Hepburn. I checked it out after seeing the clip inIf These Walls Could Talk 2.It's hard to know where to start. I suppose everyone knows it is based on a play by Lillian Hellman about a school that ends up closing after a malicious little girl spreads a rumor that the two teachers are having a lesbian affair. She seems to have no reason to do this other than because she dislikes the teachers. But she is a total brat! She deserves every (light) punishment they give her. I have to say the little girl (I forget the actress's name) is almost as good as the girl inThe Bad Seed! (The only part of the movie that I thought was a big plot hole was this girl's blackmail of another little girl. The other girl's ""confession"" was so obviously coerced I do not understand why the adults did not question it.)The movie is fascinating. The story is based on how a lie can ruin someone's life, until the end, when we start to realize that there is a grain of truth in that lie. It is Shirley MacClaine's character - Miss Dobie - who begins to realize that she has feelings for Audrey Hepburn's character - Miss Wright.I shared this movie with a girlfriend, and she complained that the movie was out of date and Shirley MacClaine's confession was completely overacted. She upset me. (But then, she was a rude person who criticized pretty much every movie and everything else.) I argue that this movie is not out of date at all. It was way ahead of its time, and frankly, the actors are lucky they continued to have amazing careers after it came out! Here it has been 80 years since the play was published, and there are STILL people who think it is inappropriate for gay people to be teachers! We have made progress, but it is ridiculous how little. The only difference if this happened today is that parents wouldn't be unhappy enough for the school to close. You can tell the movie is old because of the black and white and the refusal to use certain words. The whispering and speaking out of earshot of the audience is frustrating! (This was not just Hollywood code. I recently read the play and the movie was almost word for word. But written works back then probably had strict guidelines too.)The worst part (to watch) was probably Miss Dobie's realization that she was gay. But I think that was accurate for the time. We have to remember a movie is not out of date just because it does not take place today! (After all, today we do not film movies that only take place in the present.) The movie does not take place in the 30s, like the play. I am assuming it takes place in the year it was filmed, 1961, because the little girl has a TV. But anyway, Miss Dobie was horrified with her own self. She understood why the parents would not want the children around her. Seeing how few gay people were out of the closet back then, it is feasible that she had never come across a gay person. It is understandable how she would not know what to do with her own feelings. She had no one to talk to about them except Miss Wright, and that of course was uncomfortable.I have to say I hate the ending. It seemed so... unnecessary. Miss Wright was confused, but accepting. She was going to stay with Miss Dobie! I was reading the play, and at first I thought the ending for the movie had been changed. I really hate when they do that. But then I realized they had just switched around the final two scenes. For that, I have to applaud the movie producers. After reading the play, I do not hate the ending of the movie nearly so much. (This is a SPOILER for anyone who has not read the play and wants to.) Miss Wright barely reacts to Miss Dobie's death in the play! She is stone cold! It was absolutely horrible! The movie at least showed her compassion, friendship, and sadness at something that really did not need to happen.Sadly, that is way too relevant today as well. How many gay KIDS have we seen in the news who have killed themselves because of bullying at school? Even kids who have been perceived as being gay have done it. It is horrible. And instead of going in the correct direction for human rights, we still sometimes go backwards.So... Does anyone think Miss Wright may have been a lesbian as well? Or at least bisexual? She did seem to be in love with her doctor boyfriend, but she always put off marrying him. She broke up with him after the entire controversy. And most important, she stood by Miss Dobie in the end and said they could go away together and start their life over.This is a very important movie to me. HIGHLY recommended!!! (P.S. I also recommendSix Plays by Lillian Hellman. Besides ""The Children's Hour,"" it includes two plays that were made into Bette Davis movies.

THIS film is one of Hepburn's greatest, and even as one of her biggest fans, I never heard of this movie...until I saw it at blockbuster.At first, my mom didn't want me to see it. She claimed that the themes were too mature and about ""women loving women."" About a month or two later, I saw The Hours. I think I was ready for this 1961 movie.I began The Children's Hour automatically thinking that Audrey Hepburn would be my favorite character. I was wrong. I'd never seen Shirley MacLaine in a film before, and now, not only do I suspect that she's Renee Zellweger's mother, but I believe she is an amazing actress of the screen.I was also quite impressed with the performance of Veronica Cartwright, who played Rosalie (is she the sister of Nancy Cartwright, who played Brigita or someone in the Sound of Music?? they look exactly alike!!). The girl who played Mary was also a good little actress, I was just bugged by her ""confused"" and ""scared"" looks. They cracked me up, because they were so bad.Sure, it's kinda cheesy that since they can't say the word ""lesbian"" on screen they have to whisper it, or say it behind a door or something. But that's what you have to respect. Nowadays, you can just SAY something in a movie, and everyone knows what you're talking about. Back then, there were certain words that couldn't be said. Words that you had to express through acting. And Shirley MacLaine did an unbelievable job at it.Fay Bainter was nominated for her role as the evil grandma (not really evil; mary is, but whatever). What I want to know is why Shirley MacLaine didn't get nominated!! She was excellent!! Amazing!! Her performance blew me away and had me sobbing SO hard at the end of the movie!!

That is the question that is examined in Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour.Martha (Shirley Maclaine) and Karen (Audrey Hepburn) run a small boarding school in a small New England town.  Karen is engaged to a local doctor (James Garner).  When Karen punishes a malicious student, the little girl decides to get revenge.  The way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made by Martha's aunt (Miriam Hopkins).  To complicate matters, she blackmails another girl (Veronica Cartwright) into confirming the story.This lie immediately destroys the Martha and Karen's school.  But their life's are destroyed soon thereafter when their slander suit is rejected.  But when the lie exposed it is too little too late.When the play opened in the late 50's it was daring and very controversial.  When the film opened in 1961, it was still controversial.  But 40 years later, it is not the lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has changed.Hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would have gotten an Oscar nomination if she hadn't made Breakfast at Tiffany's that year.  Shirley Maclaine was fresh off her success in The Apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs.  She proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy.  But it would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role (The Turning Point).Fay Bainter and Miriam Hopkins were major character actors in the 30's and 40's and were given one final chance to show what they had left.  Bainter received an Oscar nomination for this film.William Wyler had nothing to prove in the 60's yet he continued to select great films with bite that featured women in strong roles.

Not that they are dealt with that forthrightly in the remake but at least they get some attention. Interestingly Marian Hopkins, who plays MacLaine's aunt in the 1962 version, had MacLaine's role in the original. That film really belonged to child actors Bonita Granville (the original ""Nancy Drew"") and Marcia Mae Jones.There were actually three (not two) exceptional performances in ""The Children's Hour"". MacLaine and Fay Bainter are always mentioned in discussions about the film, but Veronica Cartwright's performance as the kelpto blackmail victim (Jones' part in the original) tends to get overlooked, simply because it was a smaller part and because she was a child actor. But Wyler really gets a stunning performance out of her; in what was probably the most challenging role in the whole production. Cartwright had considerably more acting for the camera experience (and innate talent) than Karen Balkin (who played Mary) and she is able to really showcase her skills in the scenes they have together.The film concerns two unmarried teachers who run a select school for wealthy pre-teen girls. Hepburn has been engaged to Joe, a local doctor (James Garner here-Joel McCrea in the original), for two years but has been evasive about setting a date for the marriage ceremony.When the school's only behavior problem, Mary (Karen Balkin in a somewhat one dimensional performance that will have you wishing for Granville but was probably what Wyler wanted this time around) is punished, she gets even by making scandalous accusations about the two teachers. These are compounded by the ill-advised remarks of Martha's aunt. Led by Mary's grandmother (Bainter) the whole town turns against the pair, Joe being the lone holdout.As the events play out Martha must eventually confront the fact that she is in love with Karen. Although ""These Three"" had a somewhat upbeat ending such is not the case with the 1962 version which at first glance seems to be saying that once you come out there is no option but suicide. Yet on closer examination you realize that Wyler has tacked on an almost expressionistic ending to his otherwise realistic film (note the off-kilter shots of Karen running toward the house and the shadow of Martha's body on the wall of her room). This stylistic change is to be read as an allegorical statement; that when a society banishes and ostracizes those who might deviate from normal convention, it denies such individuals a useful and productive place within its structure (metaphorically the right to exist).Then again, what do I know?

Veronica Cartwright has successfully gone from kid to adult roles. But whatever happened to Karen Balkin, the center of this film. She's magnificent as the spoiled rotten little brat...and Ive never heard of her since. I saw this film in its initial release when I was 14. I had read the play and thought it'd be interesting to see how the Lesbianism issue was dealt with. Well, I learned a lot from this film, which is most definitely NOT about Lesbians, but is about intolerance,  unconscionable spite and its consequences. This play was first filmed in 1936 as ""These Three"", also directed by William Wyler. The plot was entirely turned around with no suggestion of Lesbians. If you saw the film ""Julia"" (with Jane Fonda as Lillian Hellmann) it is regarded as Hellmann's most difficult as to resolution. Miriam Hopkins played Martha in the '36 film and returns here to play the goofy Aunt Lilly. Fay Bainter was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, coming out of retirement to (brilliantly) play the old matriarch grandmother of rotten little Karen Balkin. (Note: in the '36 version little Bonita Granville played the role and was nominated). Again, this film is not about any particular kind of sexuality, rather the devastation of spiteful lies. Hepburn & Maclaine are excellent and I disagree that Maclaine overdid the ending. Wyler was never known as an ""intuitive"" director; rather, relying on the intelligence of good actors & writers. The slow strides of gay-themed films is an interesting subject, the taboo first tackled by Vincente Minnelli in ""Tea & Sympathy"" in 1956 (and severely white-washed); ""The Children's Hour"" attempted the same and, though Production codes were more relaxed in '61, Hellmann's profound ending was also somewhat subdued. Ugliness of character has always been a favorite subject of playwrights and filmmakers; the rotten little kid routine has been overused by Hollywood.  If so many films are being remade these days, mostly crappy films to begin with, and with the new regime of interesting directors out there looking for material, why not re-do this as Hellmann intended? Evil children are a staple of Hollywood. Bonita Granville was, indeed, excellent in the first film version. But Karen Balkin's interpretation reminds me a lot of Patty McCormack in ""The Bad Seed"" (not a bad model). If there's a lesson to be learned, it's that once the damage is done, it's hard to recover. I also understand that there was a courtroom scene which was cut from the film. If this footage exists, I would love to see it in a DVD version. I'd like to know what happened to Karen Balkin.

Storey ""rkstorey""","[4, 10]","The power this film has is in showing how a young, spoiled, manipulative child mixes gossip, cunning, fear, imagination, and spite to serve her own vendetta while remaining oblivious to the actual harm she has caused.  But she only gets the ball rolling.  There are several guilty parties in what ultimately ends up being a cliched tragedy.Bad seed Mary lies, throw tantrums, and defies authority.  At the cusp of puberty, she titillates herself and her roommates with what appears to be a book that has sex as its subject.  After her teachers identify her as a bad influence, they have her switch rooms with young Rosalie.  Already feeling vindictive, she literally strong-arms her classmate, Rosalie, into divulging something incriminating about herself and wastes no time in parlaying that knowledge into blackmail.  There is no explanation for her behavior; her grandmother does not appear to be overly indulgent in any way.Much of what drives this story is irony.  Mary's grandmother is skeptical of Mary's tale until she hears the one truthful part straight from the horse's mouth.  Picking up where Mary left off, the grandmother effectively ruins the girls' school where Hepburn and McClaine are headmistresses.  After the teachers have lost a slander suit against the grandmother, it is revealed that Mary lied.  And yet (again) there is still some truth to the lie.  And that's where the film goes downhill.While the film deserves nods for mentioning lesbianism, to say it is about lesbians is slightly inaccurate.  I found Shirley McClaine's epiphany to be more of a plot device.  It reminds me of the tragic mulatto character in race-related stories.  Perhaps that is not what Lillian Hellman intended, but unfortunately it comes across that way.  And quite frankly McClaine's decision doesn't really make sense given what had transpired.  Nor is there really any strong social statement.  There's an implied ""pity the poor girl; she can't help that she's THAT way"".  In the end, the movie really only goes as far as explicitly applying the word ""lovers"" to two women.Audrey Hepburn plays a supportive and sympathetic friend with her usual blandness.  She is not able to pull off the one demanding scene where she prods her fiance into revealing what she always suspected.  James Garner really does not have much to do but to stand by his woman as long as she'll let him.  And, for no apparent reason, Hepburn saunters off into her future with a defiant look on her face, suggesting an aloofness incongruous to the close friendship that helped spark the rumour.I would be interested in seeing ""These Three"".  Oddly enough, several movie books I have claim that work as the much stronger and more compelling film, despite its bowdlerization.  This suggests to me that the focus of the story really is the power of whisper and social norms rather than lesbianism.  What destroys lives is the allegation that one's behavior is socially (and as such, morally) repugnant.",3,"Story 8, Film 5",1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,2978,"['power', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'young', 'spoiled', 'manipulative', 'child', 'mixes', 'gossip', 'cunning', 'fear', 'imagination', 'spite', 'serve', 'own', 'vendetta', 'remaining', 'oblivious', 'actual', 'harm', 'caused', 'only', 'ball', 'rolling', 'are', 'several', 'guilty', 'parties', 'what', 'ultimately', 'up', 'being', 'cliched', 'tragedy.Bad', 'seed', 'Mary', 'throw', 'tantrums', 'defies', 'authority', 'cusp', 'puberty', 'roommates', 'what', 'be', 'book', 'sex', 'subject', 'teachers', 'identify', 'bad', 'influence', 'have', 'switch', 'rooms', 'young', 'Rosalie', 'Already', 'feeling', 'vindictive', 'literally', 'classmate', 'Rosalie', 'divulging', 'something', 'incriminating', 'time', 'parlaying', 'knowledge', 'blackmail', 'explanation', 'behavior', 'grandmother', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'overly', 'indulgent', 'way.Much', 'what', 'story', 'irony', 'Mary', 'grandmother', 'skeptical', 'Mary', 'tale', 'one', 'truthful', 'part', 'straight', 'horse', 'mouth', 'Picking', 'up', 'where', 'Mary', 'left', 'off', 'grandmother', 'effectively', 'girls', 'school', 'where', 'Hepburn', 'McClaine', 'are', 'headmistresses', 'teachers', 'have', 'lost', 'slander', 'suit', 'grandmother', 'revealed', 'Mary', 'lied', 'yet', 'again', 'still', 'truth', 'lie', 'where', 'film', 'film', 'nods', 'mentioning', 'lesbianism', 'say', 'lesbians', 'slightly', 'inaccurate', 'found', 'Shirley', 'McClaine', 'epiphany', 'be', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'tragic', 'mulatto', 'character', 'race-related', 'stories', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'what', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', 'intended', 'unfortunately', 'way', 'quite', 'frankly', 'McClaine', 'decision', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'given', 'what', 'had', 'transpired', 'really', 'strong', 'social', 'statement', 'implied', 'pity', 'poor', 'girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'as', 'far', 'explicitly', 'applying', 'word', 'lovers', 'two', 'women.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'supportive', 'sympathetic', 'friend', 'usual', 'blandness', 'not', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'one', 'demanding', 'scene', 'where', 'fiance', 'revealing', 'what', 'always', 'suspected', 'James', 'Garner', 'really', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'stand', 'woman', 'as', 'long', ""'ll"", 'let', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Hepburn', 'off', 'future', 'defiant', 'look', 'face', 'suggesting', 'aloofness', 'incongruous', 'close', 'friendship', 'helped', 'spark', 'rumour.I', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Three', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'several', 'movie', 'books', 'have', 'claim', 'work', 'much', 'stronger', 'more', 'compelling', 'film', 'bowdlerization', 'focus', 'story', 'really', 'power', 'whisper', 'social', 'norms', 'rather', 'lesbianism', 'What', 'allegation', 'one', 'behavior', 'socially', 'such', 'morally', 'repugnant']",N/A
278569,ALD1CRUBY1365,6301967119,R. L. MILLER,"[1, 1]","This film takes its name from that of the old Longfellow poem, but the juxtaposition of the poem's theme of little girls as per the old sugar-and-spice cliche--placed alongside the sobering reality of how mean-spirited children who have not been taught otherwise can be--is a study in bitter irony. Two college chums (Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine) are running a girls' private school. One of the girls, Rosalie, is a developing kleptomaniac who steals trinkets from the other girls, and another girl, Mary, catches onto it, using it to extort her. But Rosalie is not Mary's only victim--she's a spoiled brat who wants her way no matter what and sees all punishments by the teachers as an act of war. And when she decides to get payback on them by accusing them of having a lesbian affair, a charge made to her grandmother who dotes on the child. The story goes the predictable route of scandal and parents show up to pull their daughters out of school. Hepburn's doctor boyfriend (James Garner) is even drawn into it, as is their relationship. The whole thing had me reflecting on the old Colonial penalty of the ""ducking stool"" for gossiping, and how ""backwards"" it supposedly was compared to these ""enlightened"" times.I first saw this film with my parents when I was only a few years older than the schoolgirls featured in the story and I only had a vague idea of what it all meant. Since gay rights seems to be a thermonuclear-level hot button issue nowadays, there are going to be a lot of viewers who pick that as this tragedy's central theme. A lot of people are going ignore that single-issue fixation as they spot the fact that the central point is how destructive lying can be, even coming from a child. But there's another point being made here that may be unintentionally just as important. One of the adult characters says ""a little girl gets bored and tells a lie"" at one point late in the film. Now, decades later, I can't help but notice that a lot of pretty reprehensible behavior falls under the alibi ""because I was bored"".

One that I had heard mentioned, and almost always dismissively, was The Children's Hour. The reason for that dismissal was the ending, which was required during the time period in which it was written and filmed, where the gay character must end up straight or dead. There was little leeway allowed for anything else released to mainstream America.But that's not important. The Children's Hour is beautifully filmed in black and white, showcasing to our modern color sensitivities how wonderfully textured such film can be. The acting is top notch from everyone involved, with the performances by Hepburn and McLaine being almost flawless (if a little over the top in the dramatic scene near the end by McLaine). The movie is also a wonderful capture of a distinct period in time that was not so long ago, yet utterly different from current America, where women and girls always wore their gloves and men weren't seen without their jacket and tie.While parts of the plot and the view of lesbians as unnatural offend modern liberal thinking, it's a dramatic and important demonstration of the fact that IS how most of society viewed such matters. To take offense and not pay attention to the layers and depth of the relationships between the characters is to do the movie a disservice. Too many stick to the surface of Hepburn's character being portrayed as the good straight one and McLaine's as being the pervert and in their outrage overlook the deep love that Hepburn's character has for her longtime best friend.Of course many also get caught up in the whole lesbian issue, which doesn't really even get expounded upon until the very end, and miss the real gist of the movie which surrounds the powerplays among children and how their unthinking actions and words can spill over and take on a life of their own, destroying people in the process. Children, through their lack of emotional maturity, are not able to see outside of themselves or their immediate selfish wants and needs and this movie is a very dramatic portrayal of that very thing.If you enjoy good black and white cinema, if you enjoy movies that capture a time period, if you enjoy Hepburn and/or McLaine, if you enjoy a movie that portrays a deep and caring relationship between two women, I suggest not overlooking The Children's Hour.",4,Too often and easily dismissed,1008806400,"12 20, 2001",2001,2435,"['Coming', 'out', 'mid', '80', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'choose', 'when', 'came', 'movies', 'included', 'lesbian', 'characters', 'One', 'had', 'heard', 'mentioned', 'almost', 'always', 'dismissively', 'was', 'Children', 'Hour', 'reason', 'dismissal', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'required', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'written', 'filmed', 'where', 'gay', 'character', 'must', 'end', 'up', 'straight', 'dead', 'was', 'little', 'leeway', 'allowed', 'anything', 'else', 'released', 'mainstream', 'America.But', 'not', 'important', 'Children', 'Hour', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'showcasing', 'modern', 'color', 'how', 'wonderfully', 'textured', 'such', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'everyone', 'involved', 'performances', 'Hepburn', 'McLaine', 'being', 'almost', 'flawless', 'little', 'top', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'end', 'McLaine', 'movie', 'also', 'wonderful', 'capture', 'distinct', 'period', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'yet', 'utterly', 'different', 'current', 'America', 'where', 'women', 'girls', 'always', 'wore', 'gloves', 'men', 'were', ""n't"", 'seen', 'jacket', 'tie.While', 'parts', 'plot', 'view', 'lesbians', 'unnatural', 'offend', 'modern', 'liberal', 'thinking', 'dramatic', 'important', 'demonstration', 'fact', 'how', 'most', 'society', 'viewed', 'such', 'matters', 'take', 'offense', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'layers', 'depth', 'relationships', 'characters', 'do', 'movie', 'disservice', 'Too', 'many', 'stick', 'surface', 'Hepburn', 'character', 'being', 'portrayed', 'good', 'straight', 'one', 'McLaine', 'being', 'pervert', 'outrage', 'deep', 'love', 'Hepburn', 'character', 'longtime', 'best', 'friend.Of', 'course', 'many', 'also', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'whole', 'lesbian', 'issue', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'get', 'expounded', 'very', 'end', 'miss', 'real', 'gist', 'movie', 'powerplays', 'children', 'how', 'unthinking', 'actions', 'words', 'can', 'spill', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'destroying', 'people', 'process', 'Children', 'lack', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'see', 'immediate', 'selfish', 'needs', 'movie', 'very', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'very', 'enjoy', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'cinema', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'capture', 'time', 'period', 'enjoy', 'Hepburn', 'and/or', 'McLaine', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'deep', 'caring', 'relationship', 'two', 'women', 'suggest', 'not', 'overlooking', 'Children', 'Hour']",N/A

Expertly directed by William Wilder, the film is a multi-layered, richly textured morality tale regarding a simple lie and it's devastating consequences. Considered quite controversial upon it's initial release, the film seems rather tame by today's standards.As headmistresses of the exclusive Wright-Dobie School for Girls, Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine deliver stand-out performances, acting as teachers, disciplinarians, and den-mothers to a brood of twenty girls under their charge. After Mary (Karen Balkin) a deceitful, lying little bully who is black-mailing one of her fellow classmates, is punished by Karen (Hepburn) and Martha (MacLaine), she takes revenge by twisting an overheard comment between the two women and turns it into a vicious falsehood against her teachers, intimating that the two are lovers. She relates this lie to her overly trusting grandmother (Acadamy Award nominee Fay Bainter) who soon spreads the gossip to the parents of the other girls and to the community at large. The resulting furor threatens the future of the school and ostracizes the two women as outcasts.Unfortunately, the lie also forces a guilt-ridden Martha to examine her feelings for her friend and confront her own repressed homosexuality, which leads to disasterous results.Although the homosexual aspect of the story has taken the focus (complete with the gay character being punished for her ""perversion"".......a norm in films of the time which featured a gay character), the film's core is actually about the utter destruction that can be caused by innuendo and half-truths and the power of the spoken word.Hepburn and MacLaine are backed up with equally powerful perfomances from Bainter, Miriam Hopkins as Martha's somewhat daffy Aunt Lillian and James Garner as Karen's frustrated but ever loyal fiance. Angela Cartwright (of ""Lost In Space"" fame) has a smaller role as the kleptomaniac student being blackmailed by Mary. The film is beautifully photographed in black and white which actually enhances the tone of the film. The peaceful and serene country setting of the picture mirrors the opening scenes of happiness, hope and contentment but soon stands in stark contrast to the turmoil which soon takes place within it's idyllic confines.The DVD version provides excellent picture and sound quality but alas, offers no extras except for a theatrical trailer, thereby excluding it from a full 5-star rating.",4,A Child's Lie,1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,2537,"['Children', 'Hour', 'based', 'play', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', 'anyone', 'who', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'Expertly', 'directed', 'William', 'Wilder', 'film', 'multi-layered', 'richly', 'textured', 'morality', 'tale', 'regarding', 'simple', 'lie', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'Considered', 'quite', 'controversial', 'initial', 'release', 'film', 'rather', 'tame', 'today', 'standards.As', 'headmistresses', 'exclusive', 'Wright-Dobie', 'School', 'Girls', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'deliver', 'stand-out', 'performances', 'acting', 'teachers', 'disciplinarians', 'den-mothers', 'brood', 'twenty', 'girls', 'charge', 'Mary', 'Karen', 'Balkin', 'deceitful', 'lying', 'little', 'bully', 'who', 'black-mailing', 'one', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'punished', 'Karen', 'Hepburn', 'Martha', 'MacLaine', 'revenge', 'twisting', 'overheard', 'comment', 'two', 'women', 'vicious', 'falsehood', 'teachers', 'intimating', 'two', 'are', 'lovers', 'lie', 'overly', 'trusting', 'grandmother', 'Acadamy', 'Award', 'nominee', 'Fay', 'Bainter', 'who', 'soon', 'gossip', 'parents', 'other', 'girls', 'community', 'large', 'resulting', 'furor', 'future', 'school', 'two', 'women', 'outcasts.Unfortunately', 'lie', 'also', 'guilt-ridden', 'Martha', 'examine', 'feelings', 'friend', 'confront', 'own', 'repressed', 'homosexuality', 'disasterous', 'homosexual', 'aspect', 'story', 'taken', 'focus', 'complete', 'gay', 'character', 'being', 'punished', 'perversion', '.a', 'norm', 'films', 'time', 'featured', 'gay', 'character', 'film', 'core', 'actually', 'utter', 'destruction', 'can', 'be', 'caused', 'innuendo', 'half-truths', 'power', 'spoken', 'word.Hepburn', 'MacLaine', 'are', 'backed', 'up', 'equally', 'powerful', 'perfomances', 'Bainter', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'Martha', 'somewhat', 'daffy', 'Aunt', 'Lillian', 'James', 'Garner', 'Karen', 'frustrated', 'ever', 'loyal', 'fiance', 'Angela', 'Cartwright', 'Lost', 'Space', 'fame', 'smaller', 'role', 'kleptomaniac', 'student', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'Mary', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'black', 'white', 'actually', 'tone', 'film', 'peaceful', 'serene', 'country', 'setting', 'picture', 'opening', 'scenes', 'happiness', 'hope', 'contentment', 'soon', 'stands', 'stark', 'contrast', 'turmoil', 'soon', 'place', 'idyllic', 'confines.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'excellent', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'alas', 'extras', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'thereby', 'excluding', 'full', '5-star', 'rating']",N/A
278581,A366K6G0ISLX7Q,6301967119,vs,"[4, 4]","It's worth remembering that this movie is based on the 1934 play by Lillian Hellman, first of all - because the film is made very much like a play: everything happens in very few indoor locations, limited space, theatrically emphasized characters. Black-and-white cinematography allows to make each scene even more graphically and otherwise expressive.Surely in 1934 the subject of lesbianism was even more explosive than in 1961, but even in 1961 one can imagine it took a lot of courage to show some sympathy towards a homosexually inclined young woman.Even though the movie is about many other things (damaging power of rumors, manipulative children and adults, lack of trust between even the closest people) - theme of homosexuality and inability of a person to come to terms with her own sexual orientation is surely very prominent in this film.The film is brilliant in every possible sense, starting from the cast where there's not a single failure, to the camera work and the script (based on the Hellman's play). The only problem I see with the film is its being ""better than life"", with all participants either extremely nice & beautiful or extremely evil. But this melodramatic slant is most likely coming from the play too.Interestingly, according to Wikipedia, the play is in turn based on a real historical incident which happened in 1810 in Edinburgh, Scotland, where a pupil named Jane Cumming accused her schoolmistresses, Jane Pirie and Marianne Woods, of having an affair in the presence of their pupils.Dame Cumming Gordon, the accuser's influential grandmother, advised her friends to remove their daughters from the boarding school. Within days the school was deserted and the two women had lost their livelihood. Pirie and Woods eventually won, both in court and on appeal, but given the damage done to their lives, their victory was considered hollow.",4,"The Children's Hour, 1934",1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,1874,"['worth', 'remembering', 'movie', 'based', '1934', 'play', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', 'first', 'film', 'made', 'very', 'much', 'play', 'everything', 'very', 'few', 'indoor', 'locations', 'limited', 'space', 'theatrically', 'emphasized', 'characters', 'Black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'make', 'scene', 'even', 'more', 'graphically', 'otherwise', 'expressive.Surely', '1934', 'subject', 'lesbianism', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'explosive', '1961', 'even', '1961', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'took', 'lot', 'courage', 'show', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'homosexually', 'inclined', 'young', 'woman.Even', 'movie', 'about', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'damaging', 'power', 'rumors', 'manipulative', 'children', 'adults', 'lack', 'trust', 'even', 'closest', 'people', 'theme', 'homosexuality', 'inability', 'person', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'surely', 'very', 'prominent', 'film.The', 'film', 'brilliant', 'possible', 'sense', 'starting', 'cast', 'where', 'not', 'single', 'failure', 'camera', 'work', 'script', 'based', 'Hellman', 'play', 'only', 'problem', 'see', 'film', 'being', 'better', 'life', 'participants', 'extremely', 'nice', 'beautiful', 'extremely', 'evil', 'melodramatic', 'slant', 'most', 'likely', 'coming', 'play', 'too.Interestingly', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'play', 'turn', 'based', 'real', 'historical', 'incident', 'happened', '1810', 'Edinburgh', 'Scotland', 'where', 'pupil', 'named', 'Jane', 'Cumming', 'accused', 'schoolmistresses', 'Jane', 'Pirie', 'Marianne', 'Woods', 'having', 'affair', 'presence', 'pupils.Dame', 'Cumming', 'Gordon', 'accuser', 'influential', 'grandmother', 'advised', 'friends', 'remove', 'daughters', 'boarding', 'school', 'Within', 'days', 'school', 'was', 'deserted', 'two', 'women', 'had', 'lost', 'livelihood', 'Pirie', 'Woods', 'eventually', 'won', 'court', 'appeal', 'given', 'damage', 'done', 'lives', 'victory', 'was', 'considered', 'hollow']",N/A
