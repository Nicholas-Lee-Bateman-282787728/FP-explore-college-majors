While the narrative was mostly accurate, albeit very cursory, many of the details were not.  For instance, without explicitly saying so, it implied that Patton was brought back into the war during the Battle of the Bulge to save the day (fact is he had already marched almost to Germany when he was tasked with pulling his division out of it current position and forced marched to relieve Bastogne).  Likewise scenes purporting to show the same battle were in sunny green fields rather than the bitter cold and snow which is the reality.  Still other extremely important personalities were, for the most part, left out - Montgomery comes to mind right away.  I certainly understand that the focus of the mini-series was to give some idea of what the major players were thinking and how they reacted, but the liberties taken with the supporting facts and scenes left a whole lot to be desired.",2,Very Disappointing,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,978,"['others', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'wound', 'up', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'narrative', 'was', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'albeit', 'very', 'cursory', 'many', 'details', 'were', 'not', 'instance', 'explicitly', 'saying', 'so', 'implied', 'Patton', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'war', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'save', 'day', 'fact', 'had', 'already', 'marched', 'almost', 'Germany', 'when', 'was', 'tasked', 'pulling', 'division', 'current', 'position', 'forced', 'marched', 'relieve', 'Bastogne', 'Likewise', 'purporting', 'show', 'same', 'battle', 'were', 'sunny', 'green', 'fields', 'rather', 'bitter', 'cold', 'snow', 'reality', 'Still', 'other', 'extremely', 'important', 'personalities', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'left', 'out', 'Montgomery', 'mind', 'right', 'away', 'certainly', 'understand', 'focus', 'mini-series', 'was', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'major', 'players', 'were', 'thinking', 'how', 'reacted', 'liberties', 'taken', 'supporting', 'facts', 'scenes', 'left', 'whole', 'lot', 'be', 'desired']",The World Wars Digital

Michael Sanford ""Book Monger""","[2, 5]","While &#34;The World Wars&#34; was macro-ly correct, there were so many mistakes in the presentation, even historical accuracy, this series is a marginally correct historical docudrama. The first big mistake, in my opinion, was leaving out Eisenhower. I know, Eisenhower was overshadowed by MacArthur's supposed genius, and Patton's personality, but Eisenhower was in charge of the American army from the African campaigns all the way through Italy when he left to prepare for Operation Overlord, the amphibious attack on France. Not once was he mentioned. Bradley, as well, was neglected. Bradley was the one general who reprimanded Patton for his slapping the war weary soldier, which was shown in this movie and in the movie &#34;Patton.&#34; Bradley then became the second in charge after Patton was relieved of his command.Some of the faults:Generals MacArthur and Marshall were shown with the five-star &#34;General of the Army&#34; insignia which weren't given until after the conflict was over.MacArthur wore a tie all of the time. He rarely wore a tie, especially during WWII.The series showed MacArthur as a genius while leading the troops in the Pacific, in reality MacArthur was unprepared when the Japanese attacked the Phillipines and committed troops to doom to obtain minimal results, particularly in New Guinea. Also, the movie also indicated that MacArthur's planning went from the Phillipines to directly to the landings on &#34;mainland&#34; Japan, in fact, we had many more large islands to attack prior to the proposed 'operation Olympic' which was to be the actual landings on mainland Japan. Formosa and Okinawa to name two.While Patton showed remarkable tank skills in France, when he was in charge of troops in Africa, many soldiers died unnecessarily because of his poor leadership. In the movie &#34;Patton,&#34; he did not stop Rommel in his tracks, Rommel out-foxed everyone and only had to pull out of Africa when he lost his supply chain. Rommel retreated to Italy virtually un-molested with all of his troops and equipment while the allies stood around smoking cigarettes.The destroyers shown were of the modern type: Guided Missile Destroyers. When showing paratroopers in the air, you can see  C131's in the background, an airplane that wasn't made until the 60's.I suggest to the reader to not waste your time renting this monstrosity. The acting is terrible, none of the actors represented their characters well; the story is lame and the facts are not complete. Instead of six hours, this story could be told in 30 minutes. I learned nothing new, it is definitely not in the same league as &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; and &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; which are by far the most realistic WWII movies available.",2,I wanted to like the series....,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,2747,"['34', 'World', 'Wars', '34', 'was', 'macro-ly', 'correct', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'mistakes', 'presentation', 'even', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'series', 'marginally', 'correct', 'historical', 'docudrama', 'first', 'big', 'mistake', 'opinion', 'was', 'leaving', 'out', 'Eisenhower', 'know', 'Eisenhower', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'MacArthur', 'supposed', 'genius', 'Patton', 'personality', 'Eisenhower', 'was', 'charge', 'American', 'army', 'African', 'campaigns', 'way', 'Italy', 'when', 'left', 'prepare', 'Operation', 'Overlord', 'amphibious', 'attack', 'France', 'Not', 'once', 'was', 'mentioned', 'Bradley', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'neglected', 'Bradley', 'was', 'one', 'general', 'who', 'reprimanded', 'Patton', 'slapping', 'war', 'weary', 'soldier', 'was', 'shown', 'movie', 'movie', '34', 'Patton.', '34', 'Bradley', 'then', 'became', 'second', 'charge', 'Patton', 'was', 'relieved', 'command.Some', 'faults', 'Generals', 'MacArthur', 'Marshall', 'were', 'shown', 'five-star', '34', 'General', 'Army', '34', 'insignia', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'conflict', 'was', 'over.MacArthur', 'tie', 'time', 'rarely', 'wore', 'tie', 'especially', 'WWII.The', 'series', 'showed', 'MacArthur', 'genius', 'leading', 'troops', 'Pacific', 'reality', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'unprepared', 'when', 'Japanese', 'attacked', 'Phillipines', 'committed', 'troops', 'doom', 'obtain', 'minimal', 'results', 'particularly', 'New', 'Guinea', 'Also', 'movie', 'also', 'indicated', 'MacArthur', 'planning', 'went', 'Phillipines', 'directly', 'landings', '34', 'mainland', '34', 'Japan', 'fact', 'had', 'many', 'more', 'large', 'islands', 'attack', 'prior', 'proposed', ""'operation"", 'Olympic', 'was', 'be', 'actual', 'landings', 'mainland', 'Japan', 'Formosa', 'Okinawa', 'name', 'two.While', 'Patton', 'showed', 'remarkable', 'tank', 'skills', 'France', 'when', 'was', 'charge', 'troops', 'Africa', 'many', 'soldiers', 'died', 'unnecessarily', 'poor', 'leadership', 'movie', '34', 'Patton', '34', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'Rommel', 'tracks', 'Rommel', 'out-foxed', 'everyone', 'only', 'had', 'pull', 'Africa', 'when', 'lost', 'supply', 'chain', 'Rommel', 'retreated', 'Italy', 'virtually', 'un-molested', 'troops', 'equipment', 'allies', 'stood', 'smoking', 'cigarettes.The', 'destroyers', 'shown', 'were', 'modern', 'type', 'Guided', 'Missile', 'Destroyers', 'When', 'showing', 'paratroopers', 'air', 'can', 'see', 'C131', 'background', 'airplane', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', ""60's.I"", 'suggest', 'reader', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'renting', 'monstrosity', 'acting', 'terrible', 'none', 'actors', 'represented', 'characters', 'well', 'story', 'lame', 'facts', 'are', 'not', 'complete', 'Instead', 'six', 'hours', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'told', '30', 'minutes', 'learned', 'nothing', 'new', 'definitely', 'not', 'same', 'league', '34', 'Band', 'Brothers', '34', '34', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '34', 'are', 'far', 'most', 'realistic', 'WWII', 'movies', 'available']",The World Wars Digital

We all know how he ends up looking i.e. DORKAMUNDO as Fonzie would say.It appears to be a weird young/old Hitler, Churchill, FDR, Patton and MacArthur exercise but the Patton and MacArthur segments really perk up the series.  It's great how they and Churchill prepped for the return of war since they were firmly convinced of Germany's &#34;I'll be back nature.&#34;Hitler is presented as if he were some grass roots DIY-er who managed to hold an entire country under his hypnotic sway but the series succeeds in communicating that he was a failure and probably afraid of holding a regular job hence his insistence on an artistic career for which he was not qualified.  What he represents is everybody else in Germany who went Nahtzee on the rest of the world and this series like everything else from History/Discovery/Military/American Hero channel hints that Hitler was just a frontman for the real power in Germany behind both world wars.By using these individuals from different countries to tell the story, the series is able to bring up issues like the fact that America was distracted by war with Mexico and coincidentally, we were finally brought into war with the discovery of the Zimmerman telegram wherein Germany offers Mexico help in taking back territory such as ... Texas.Bearing in mind that in 1915, Germany was mentoring the Ottoman Turks re the Armenian Genocide and that Turkey with Germany formed the Central Powers.So maybe getting caught redhanded assassinating their own Habsburg royal to start WW1 spurred the real masterminds to use an actor who found himself after WW1 directed by government to infiltrate the Workers Party.

1697282,A3GOP9I92XD07N,B00KFNF2DM,"Easton Reader ""Easton Reader""","[4, 7]","In spite of a number of excellent, well-acted dramatizations, this mini-series seems poorly researched and unbalanced. The dramatizations of the future leaders in the first world war is appropriate, but not Generals MacArthur or Patton.  What was the point of dramatizing Patton's infamous slapping of shell-shocked soldier who was also suffering from malaria?  The narration asserts that Roosevelt ordered the Allied invasion of Sicily from far that Stalin rather than Hitler would control Europe.  What happened to the North African campaign?  Why then was the USA supplying Stalin with equipment? Stalin in fact was pleading with the allies to open a second front. Later the narrator says that in Stalingrad the Russians had a secret weapon - the infamous Russian winter, and troops from Siberia, well acclimated to winter fighting.  True - but more so for battle of Moscow which antedated the battle of Stalingrad.  Minor errors can be seen in some of the dramatizations: Hitler's armband with two black stripes is an SS armband, not used by Hitler; an SS officer carries a cap with Wehrmacht insignia; a Kriegsmarine flag over a concentration camp, Hitler committed suicide sitting on a sofa in his quarters in the bunker, not in an office in uniform.  More irritating is the pointless babble from politicians: former Vice-president Dick Cheney, former Secretary of  Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and former Senator Joe Lieberman.  None of the commentaries, not even from noted Third Reich historian Sir Richard Evans, was necessary.  His knowledge and expertise should have been consulted in the basic planning of what topics should have been covered and to correct the inaccuracies.

1697284,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00KFNF2DM,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","The History Channel presents a miniseries of six hours on three nights as an overview of the concept that the beginnings of WW I and the events that occurred in that first World War were played out by the same set of characters and in doing so the series presents the backgrounds of each of the major world players in a manner that allows us to see them as individuals rather than historical tropes. Until Amazon makes this available this review is pictured by another series made two years ago with a bit of a different approach. But for those who may be deciding whether or not to catch the current series, hopefully this brief overview will assist.As the description for the series state, `The World Wars tells the story of three decades of war told through the eyes of various men who were its key players: Roosevelt, Hitler, Patton, Mussolini, Churchill, Tojo, DeGaulle and MacArthur. The series examines the two wars as one contiguous timeline starting in 1914 and concluding in 1945 with these unique individuals coming of age in World War I before ultimately calling the shots in World War II.Narrated by Jeremy Renner and with comments throughout the series from Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Leon Panetta, John McCain, John Major, Mario Monti and many historians and correspondents form the US and Britain, the series is a collage of battle scenes (some repetitive, but war is repetitive), but adding the young and old versions of Stalin (Jacopo Rampini /not listed), Mussolini (Nabil Vinas/Jonathan Hartman), MacArthur (Prescott Hathaway/not listed), DeGaulle (Michael Perrie. Jr./Don Meehan), Churchill (Tom Vickers/Ian Beyts), Hitler (Maximillian Klas/not listed ), Lenin (C Conrad Cady), Patton (Matt Dearman/Don Hartman), FDR (Kevin McKillip/not listed), and Tojo (not listed).The series is directed by John Ealer and written by Chelsea Coates, Zachary Hartmann, Claire Lawton, Alec Michod, Jordan Rosenblum, and David White. No, it isn't all the information about he wars but it is a psychological study of the men who were at the helm of each country involved.

From the channel that brings us such intellectual fare as ""Ancient Aliens"" and ""Ice Road Truckers"" comes an over-ambitious and under-researched summary of the most important decades of the 20th century filled with mistakes and omissions. They run the gamut from little things like Gen. MacArthur having 5 stars on his collar in the 30's and German soldiers using English rifles, and showing B-17s and P-51s when discussing the Battle of Britain, to setting the Beer Hall Putsch & march through the streets in what appears to be an unused railway station and implying that it was FDR who planned the battle of Midway. Omissions include not even mentioning such minor characters as Generals Eisenhower, Montgomery and Rommel and Admirals Nimitz and Halsey as well as things like the Soviet invasion of Finland, and pretty much the bulk of the Pacific theater aside from the Philippines.There are a plethora of others, far too many to recount, but they simply show that the producers were far more concerned with the ""look"" than the ""facts"". The problem is almost all of these could have been corrected with a modicum of effort, but that was, apparently, not in the budget after paying someone like Donald Rumsfeld to give his ""expert"" opinion on Hitler.

1697287,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00KFNF2DM,Patrick L. Randall,"[9, 13]","I'm actually pretty disappointed in the mini-series. It's very superficial, as if it was lifted from Wikipedia. There are small inaccuracies, such as showing General MacArthur wearing his 5-star insignia during a 1930's meeting with FDR, when such a rank was even created until 1944. There are omissions, such as ignoring the fact that Patton was wounded on the battlefield during WWI, leaving him with a feeling that he really didn't contribute to the war effort (despite the success he had) and leaving him chomping at the bit to get another major conflict to prove himself in (read his biography by Carlo D'Este and you'll see that)....and glaring inaccuracies, such as suggesting that the Bolshevik partnership of Lenin and Stalin overthrew the Czar (This is inaccurate for two reasons... Stalin's own propaganda suggested he played much more of a key role in support Lenin than he actually did. Lenin, in fact, did not trust Stalin... but was willing to use him..... the other inaccuracy is that the Bolsheviks did not storm anything and oust the Czar... there were protests from all over Russia, leading to Czar Nicholas' ministers and military advisers recommended he abdicate... which he did, in favor of provisional government that the Bolsheviks actually DID overthrow 8 months later)...with the way the series was promoted, I expected something much more detailed and involved.

This is not a documentary to learn about history, it's not even a good overview.The documentary begins with Hitler and doesn't even mention Gavrilo Princip assassinating Franz Ferdinand which was the catalyst for all this in the first place.  There's no mention of the national tensions between Britain, Germany, Russia, France etc. that planted the seeds for WWI.  No mention of the Three Cousins or what each side had to lose.  The Russian Revolution was mentioned only once and inaccurately and there's hardly if any mention of the sinking of the Luisitania which sparked American calls for intervention after wanting to remain neutral.World War II was better but not much.One of the two bright spots of this documentary were an okay overview of the peace of 1919 and the conditions that led to World War II.  However it left out the Spanish Civil War which is seen as a precursor to World War II.  The other was the dramatizations which gave the viewer a glimpse into the time and what the key figures were dealing with.  The music was also good.Obviously it is impossible to include everything in a 30+ year period in a less than 3 hour documentary, however more could've been done to make it more accurate and reflective of what actually happened.",3,"Very flawed, one-sided and incomplete historical documentary",1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,1517,"['Three', 'stars', 'generous', 'were', 'parts', 'enjoyed.I', 'understand', 'tagline', 'documentary', 'do', 'men', 'who', 'became', 'key', 'figures', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'how', 'World', 'War', 'made', 'men', 'were', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'completely', 'brushed', 'aside', 'not', 'documentary', 'learn', 'history', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'overview.The', 'documentary', 'Hitler', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'Gavrilo', 'Princip', 'assassinating', 'Franz', 'Ferdinand', 'was', 'catalyst', 'first', 'place', 'mention', 'national', 'tensions', 'Britain', 'Germany', 'Russia', 'France', 'etc', 'planted', 'seeds', 'WWI', 'mention', 'Three', 'Cousins', 'what', 'side', 'had', 'lose', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'was', 'mentioned', 'only', 'once', 'inaccurately', 'hardly', 'mention', 'sinking', 'Luisitania', 'sparked', 'American', 'calls', 'intervention', 'wanting', 'remain', 'neutral.World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'better', 'not', 'much.One', 'two', 'bright', 'spots', 'documentary', 'were', 'okay', 'overview', 'peace', '1919', 'conditions', 'led', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'However', 'left', 'out', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'seen', 'precursor', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'other', 'was', 'dramatizations', 'gave', 'viewer', 'glimpse', 'time', 'what', 'key', 'figures', 'were', 'dealing', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'good.Obviously', 'impossible', 'include', 'everything', '30+', 'year', 'period', 'less', '3', 'hour', 'documentary', 'however', 'more', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'make', 'more', 'accurate', 'reflective', 'what', 'actually', 'happened']",The World Wars Digital

For the span of time in which the two world wars occurred, the show emphasizes that the Great War and Second World War in Europe and the Pacific from 1914 to 1945, roughly ran 30 years; includes the interwar activities and the build up of the conflicts that would arise by 1939 as a part of the stretch of time.  The show contained much attraction and material for any viewer to be enticed to watch.  And for history buffs, learners, readers, and teachers of the events of the past, especially particular areas of the Second World War, one major and interesting observation of the unique format of the program, a blend of documentary, recreation, and re-enactment, the show displayed the key leaders of the two wars as larger than life and iconic in stature - Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, General George Patton, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt; each in physical appearance in every segment and scene of the show displayed these individuals much like the recent movies recreating superheroes and villains, i.e. G.I. Joe, Captain America, and the Avengers.However, there appeared an imbalance of the representation or mention of other essential leaders from each of the two theatres of the war, western or eastern, Generals Douglas MacArthur, Emperor Hirohito, Hideki Tojo, Dwight D. Eisenhower, George Marshall, and Admirals Chester Nimitz and William Halsey and Isoroku Yamamoto, and how the eastern front, especially during World War I and World War II may not have been equally represented in scope as the European front; the first world war conflict did stretch across geographical boundaries and impacted colonies in Asia and the Pacific as well and participants and volunteers.  There was indeed much conflict in the Pacific Ocean and the southern most corridors of islands that took more than two years to deter the Japanese imperial military forces by way of strenuous campaigns and unwelcome weather conditions and climates overlooked in the show.  What happened after Midway and Guadalcanal and what happened in the Philippines for forces to eventually move into Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and the fateful days of August 6 and 9, 1945?Beyond the appearance of the leaders that encountered the world on their shoulders, with many film recreations of the first and second world wars, there is bound to be something missing amidst the tremendous pieces of the puzzle of historical events.  One can discuss and debate of the would and could have been, but importantly, this part of history is once again being retold so not to be forgotten by new generations and to learn from these pivotal events.",3,More than one way to view and retell the history of the two world wars,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,2758,"['watching', 'History', 'Channels', 'much', 'anticipated', 'three-night', 'miniseries', 'World', 'Wars', 'array', 'thoughts', 'emerge', 'span', 'time', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'occurred', 'show', 'Great', 'War', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Europe', 'Pacific', '1914', '1945', 'roughly', 'ran', '30', 'years', 'interwar', 'activities', 'build', 'conflicts', 'would', 'arise', '1939', 'part', 'stretch', 'time', 'show', 'contained', 'much', 'attraction', 'material', 'viewer', 'be', 'enticed', 'watch', 'history', 'buffs', 'learners', 'readers', 'teachers', 'events', 'past', 'especially', 'particular', 'areas', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'one', 'major', 'interesting', 'observation', 'unique', 'format', 'program', 'blend', 'documentary', 'recreation', 're-enactment', 'show', 'displayed', 'key', 'leaders', 'two', 'wars', 'larger', 'life', 'iconic', 'stature', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Benito', 'Mussolini', 'Joseph', 'Stalin', 'General', 'George', 'Patton', 'President', 'Franklin', 'D.', 'Roosevelt', 'physical', 'appearance', 'segment', 'scene', 'show', 'individuals', 'much', 'recent', 'movies', 'recreating', 'superheroes', 'villains', 'i.e', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Captain', 'America', 'Avengers.However', 'appeared', 'imbalance', 'representation', 'mention', 'other', 'essential', 'leaders', 'two', 'theatres', 'war', 'western', 'eastern', 'Generals', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'Emperor', 'Hirohito', 'Hideki', 'Tojo', 'Dwight', 'D.', 'Eisenhower', 'George', 'Marshall', 'Admirals', 'Chester', 'Nimitz', 'William', 'Halsey', 'Isoroku', 'Yamamoto', 'how', 'eastern', 'front', 'especially', 'World', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'equally', 'represented', 'scope', 'European', 'front', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'conflict', 'did', 'stretch', 'geographical', 'boundaries', 'impacted', 'colonies', 'Asia', 'Pacific', 'well', 'participants', 'volunteers', 'was', 'indeed', 'much', 'conflict', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'southern', 'most', 'corridors', 'islands', 'took', 'more', 'two', 'years', 'deter', 'Japanese', 'imperial', 'military', 'forces', 'way', 'strenuous', 'campaigns', 'unwelcome', 'weather', 'conditions', 'climates', 'overlooked', 'show', 'What', 'happened', 'Midway', 'Guadalcanal', 'what', 'happened', 'Philippines', 'forces', 'eventually', 'move', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Okinawa', 'fateful', 'days', 'August', '6', '9', '1945', 'appearance', 'leaders', 'encountered', 'world', 'shoulders', 'many', 'film', 'recreations', 'first', 'second', 'world', 'wars', 'bound', 'be', 'something', 'missing', 'tremendous', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'historical', 'events', 'One', 'can', 'discuss', 'debate', 'would', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'importantly', 'part', 'history', 'once', 'again', 'being', 'retold', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'new', 'generations', 'learn', 'pivotal', 'events']",The World Wars Digital
1697290,A2IK776FY6MEMG,B00KFNF2DM,Skipjacks,"[2, 3]","I enjoyed this entire series and I do feel its' worth watching. But the viewer has to go into it knowing that's its value is in the broad overview of how World War 1 shaped the people and nations involved in World War 2.You cannot watch this for the small details and expect to learn anything because many of the small details are just flat out wrong.General Eisenhower is almost completely left out of the entire thing. That's inexcusable. Admiral Yamamoto of Japan, teh guy who planned the Pearl Harbor attacks and adamently argued with his government that it was a bad idea is 100% left out of this 3 part series without so much as his name being mentioned once. That's just insane. He was a major figure of the war and he doesn't exist in this documentary.Also there is no mention of how hard the US worked to hide Roosevelt's paralysis. They went to extreme efforts to make him look perfectly fine so he didn't appear weak to the Axis Powers. That's not mentioned once. They barely mention his polio and paralysis at all.And World War 1 was sparked when Archduke Ferdinand was shot. 3 decades of warfare where hundreds of millions died all sparked by the assasination of Ferdinand. You'd think they would have mentioned his name. But nope.Then they start taking liberties with facts. For instance Adolf Hitler had a dorky looking mustach. That's a fact. Hitler was also in a gas attack in trenched in World War 1. That's a fact. But this series connects those two facts and makes it look like Hitler's inability to get his gas mask sealed in World War 1 caused him to immediately shave the handlebars off his mustashe, giving him his goofy looking famous mustashe right there in the WWI trenches. I've never seen any suggestion that happened anywhere. It was neat in a dramatic sense, but not a historical one.It also says that the United States was pulled into World War 1 when a plan by the Germans to fund the war with Mexico to keep the US occupied backfired due to the American people finding out about the plan. That's all well and good and is factually documented, but that was more of a broad call to war. The overt act that had Americans demanding intervetion into the war was the sinking of Lusitania by a German U-Boat. I don't think that was mentioned. If it was, the Lusitania wasn't mentioned by name. And U-Boats don't come up at all.Where this series shines is showing the higher level look at how the events of World War 1 shaped the way World War 2 played out. It doesn't tell you much (at least not accurately) about Hitler the man. But it shows very well how the conditions in Germany allowed the Nazi party to rise to power and how similar conditions could lead to similar results again elsewhere in the world. It does the same thing for other events in the wars as well, but at that ""Concept"" level. Not the ""Detail"" level.To some extent I understand leaving some things out. It's a 4 and a half our series (without commercials) to document what happened on 3 continents over a 30 year span. It can't possible include everything. So I get that it can't go into detail on things like how Hitler when from not being anti-semetic in his youth to redefining the very meaning of anti-semetism in his later years. That one thing is a 3 hours documentary in itself (and a VERY interesting one) But it can't be develd into in a broad overview like this one. There are a hundred things like this that are truncated from this series and I totally understand those kind of omissions.But omitting major characters like Yamamoto and Eisenhower? And getting the details they do include about everyone else wrong? It's inexcusable. And U-Boats. Not a single mention of U-Boats. The powerhouse of the German Navy....not even mentioned.I did think they did a great job of showing what a sniveling little coward Neville Chamberlain was. And how a policy of appeasement will always cost you more in the long run.Overall it's worth watching. But don't put a lot of stock in the details.

1697291,A2ZLQ0L1KU9VLO,B00KFNF2DM,"Terry R. Reynolds ""terr@mpinet.net""","[8, 14]","I could complain about all the technical foul-ups with the dramatizations, but that has been around long before History Channel came into existence, Hollywood budgets being what they are. What I WILL complain about is a documentary that re-writes history. I'm not sure if the producers simply didn't have any historians available to consult, or if the truth was simply not the story they wanted to tell. Some of the information is simply distortion caused by the timing of the information. But, this documentary also provides information that is simply NOT TRUE, and not all of it is minor details either. For instance:Patton did NOT conquer Italy in six weeks. In fact, Patton did not conquer Italy. And, the Italian Campaign lasted almost 2 years. Slapping a soldier in Italy got Patton sidelined from the Italian campaign entirely. (The Sicilian campaign was separate from the Italian campaign and was treated separately by most historians and by this documentary.)To watch this show, you would think the US invented the tank, and Patton personally introduced armored warfare to the world. In fact, Britain invented the tank, and the US had no tanks in World War 1 other than those lent them by the French (and perhaps some from the British).To watch this show, the breaking of the Japanese codes was done by FDR's Washington code breakers and FDR warned the fleet of the impending Midway attack. Also, the ambush of the Japanese fleet was credited as FDR's ""bold plan"". The HYPO code-breakers that discovered the Japanese plans were in Hawaii and reported to Admiral Nimitz. Nimitz, Fletcher, and Spruance came up with the plans. Also, the documentary's description of the battle is incorrect, misleading, and contains false statements like that four of the carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor were destroyed in under 6 minutes.To watch this show, you would think that MacArthur was in charge of the entire Pacific campaign, except for FDR's apparent almost direct control at Midway.To watch this show, you would think that Patton was only put back in the field in order to save US forces at the Bulge. He was put back in the field right after the D-Day landings, months before the Battle of the Bulge, as soon as his part in the deception plans was over.The show makes a point of claiming that the only reason Hitler attacked Stalingrad was because it was named after Stalin, and that the only reason Stalin defended it was for the same reason. While, no doubt the name of the town was an incentive to both parties, it was a minor one. Hitler's drive to the south was to gain the Caucuses oil fields, and he had to take Stalingrad or leave a huge Russian army on his flanks.The idea of this series was a good one. Take several key figures in World War 2, and show how their experiences in World War 1 and the intervening depression shaped their lives and through them the World War 2. And, it might even be understandable if they omitted important events that didn't involve the figures they chose. But, it is not understandable when they choose to re-write history in order that the chosen figures are more prominent (Patton and FDR above), or come up with crack-pot un-substantiated ideas and present them as fact (Stalingrad above), or just plain get the history wrong.

1697292,ABGOCL0QVZRUL,B00KFNF2DM,W. Andrew Terrill,"[0, 2]","I liked this program, including the actors who were mostly good.  I noted that MacArthur called Patton ""lieutenant"" when he was a lieutenant colonel, which would never have happened.  I also noted that they had some exceptionally distinguished historians including and especially Sir Max Hastings, who is always excellent.  The gimmick in this presentation was to use modern day politicians including Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and John McCain to tell us what the wars meant.  McCain had an especially prominent role.  Almost all of the politicians used in this series (except Leon Panetta) were strong supporters of the Iraq war.  By presenting themselves as sages on the World Wars were they trying to imply that they made the correct calls in Iraq?  Or am I inferring this when it was never really implied?  Guess people will have to decide for themselves.",3,Heavy dependence on contemporary politicians to explain the wars,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,862,"['liked', 'program', 'including', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'mostly', 'good', 'noted', 'MacArthur', 'called', 'Patton', 'lieutenant', 'when', 'was', 'lieutenant', 'colonel', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'also', 'noted', 'had', 'exceptionally', 'distinguished', 'historians', 'including', 'especially', 'Sir', 'Max', 'Hastings', 'who', 'always', 'excellent', 'gimmick', 'presentation', 'was', 'use', 'modern', 'day', 'politicians', 'including', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'John', 'McCain', 'tell', 'what', 'wars', 'meant', 'McCain', 'had', 'especially', 'prominent', 'role', 'Almost', 'politicians', 'used', 'series', 'Leon', 'Panetta', 'were', 'strong', 'supporters', 'Iraq', 'war', 'presenting', 'sages', 'World', 'Wars', 'were', 'trying', 'imply', 'made', 'correct', 'calls', 'Iraq', 'am', 'inferring', 'when', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'implied', 'Guess', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'decide']",The World Wars Digital
