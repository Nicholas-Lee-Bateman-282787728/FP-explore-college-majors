The other day I remembered this little series and found the movie to rewatch it. I can't make a decent review for that, because though I'm seventeen now and can probably detach from the aspect, most of its power was in nostalgia.For some reason I didn't know there were two other movies and never watched them. So I did last week. Therefore keep in mind that my knowledge of this whole universe had mostly faded away.I'm going to throw it out there that I'm not a movie fan. It takes a lot to impress me with movies, and I tend to steer towards animated movies anyway- so these days, my expectations are high with the bar being raised nearly every day for such films.But though this is a rather old movie, I can say I loved every minute I spent watching this. I absolutely love it, along with the other 2, but this one is of the highest quality.SpOiLeR, I suppose:My favorite part, oddly enough, was when Vakama was on the villains' side. Usually I dislike tactics like that- turning the hero into the villain- but it was somehow really enthralling to watch.All in all I can say that you won't be disappointed with this. I suggest you don't watch it unless you have seen the other movies (or at LEAST Legends of Metru Nui), but those are worth it too.",5,Love it today for what it is,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,1333,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'had', 'Mask', 'Light', 'DVD', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'sure', 'other', 'day', 'remembered', 'little', 'series', 'found', 'movie', 'rewatch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'decent', 'review', ""'m"", 'seventeen', 'now', 'can', 'probably', 'detach', 'aspect', 'most', 'power', 'was', 'nostalgia.For', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'never', 'watched', 'So', 'did', 'last', 'week', 'Therefore', 'keep', 'mind', 'knowledge', 'whole', 'universe', 'had', 'mostly', 'faded', 'away.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'throw', 'out', 'there', ""'m"", 'not', 'movie', 'fan', 'lot', 'impress', 'movies', 'tend', 'steer', 'towards', 'animated', 'movies', 'anyway-', 'days', 'expectations', 'are', 'high', 'bar', 'being', 'raised', 'nearly', 'day', 'such', 'films.But', 'rather', 'old', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'loved', 'minute', 'spent', 'watching', 'absolutely', 'love', 'other', '2', 'one', 'highest', 'quality.SpOiLeR', 'suppose', 'favorite', 'part', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'when', 'Vakama', 'was', 'villains', 'side', 'Usually', 'dislike', 'tactics', 'that-', 'turning', 'hero', 'villain-', 'was', 'somehow', 'really', 'enthralling', 'watch.All', 'can', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'LEAST', 'Legends', 'Metru', 'Nui', 'are', 'worth', 'too']",Bionicle 3 - Web of Shadows

The creators even improved the soundtrack (which was fantastic to begin with).Even non-Bionicle fans might get some enjoyment out of it.Luckily the series has matured, it even shows some violence, my one complaint about it is that they didn't push for a PG-13 rating (which I think would have helped the film alot) they decided not to rate it, I think it would have been much more intense with a PG-13, and much more enjoyable.7/10 stars (3.5/5 stars)",4,Bionicle 3 - Web of Shadows,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,642,"['First', 'note', 'who', 'gave', '5/5', 'stars', 'need', 'be', 'shot.Now', 'back', 'topic', 'newest', 'installment', 'Bionicle', 'actually', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'yes', 'corny', 'parts', 'still', 'decent', 'creators', 'even', 'improved', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'fantastic', 'begin', '.Even', 'non-Bionicle', 'fans', 'might', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'it.Luckily', 'series', 'matured', 'even', 'violence', 'one', 'complaint', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'film', 'alot', 'decided', 'not', 'rate', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'PG-13', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable.7/10', 'stars', '3.5/5', 'stars']",Bionicle 3 - Web of Shadows

I'm not as huge a fan as my brother, but living with him, I've had to get to know a thing or two about this series.Web of Shadows was not terrible, it was certainly better than the first and maybe moreso than the second, but it is soooo obvious that these are just one BIG commercial.Overall, the plot line is a bit stale and hard to get caught up into. There are several sequences, such as ""Keetongu"" (or however it is spelled) or the transformation of the toa that will have anyone that is not a die hard fan rolling their eyes. Roodaka, the queen, was a refreshing new twist on the scenario and gave us something interesting, however, the relationships of the toa still seemed rather forced, which is somewhat surprising at this point.Fans of the ""bionicle"" series will rejoice at yet another installment of their favorite series, but there isn't much here for anyone else. If you don't know much about the plot, watch this with someone who knows all the names, locations, and references made, because you won't understand a word of this story otherwise.",3,Its better....,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1101,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'think', 'Bionicle', 'Ok', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'brother', 'living', ""'ve"", 'had', 'get', 'know', 'thing', 'two', 'series.Web', 'Shadows', 'was', 'not', 'terrible', 'was', 'certainly', 'better', 'first', 'maybe', 'moreso', 'second', 'soooo', 'obvious', 'are', 'just', 'one', 'BIG', 'commercial.Overall', 'plot', 'line', 'bit', 'stale', 'hard', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'are', 'several', 'sequences', 'such', 'Keetongu', 'however', 'spelled', 'transformation', 'toa', 'will', 'have', 'anyone', 'not', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'Roodaka', 'queen', 'was', 'refreshing', 'new', 'twist', 'scenario', 'gave', 'something', 'interesting', 'however', 'relationships', 'toa', 'still', 'seemed', 'rather', 'forced', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'point.Fans', 'bionicle', 'series', 'will', 'rejoice', 'yet', 'installment', 'favorite', 'series', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'anyone', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'plot', 'watch', 'someone', 'who', 'names', 'locations', 'references', 'made', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'story', 'otherwise']",Bionicle 3 - Web of Shadows

918305,A3BDE84E7N3MMP,B000A0GYCI,"WhitWire Reviews ""Ryan""","[0, 0]","When I first heard there was going to be a third Bionicle movie, I wondered exactly how much better it would be compared to Bionicle 2 - Legends of Metru Nui--a piece I love dearly even to this day. However, after seeing the movie for the first time, I began to wish the people who made it had made a more complex storyline or at least a longer movie.For a Bionicle movie, the story is pretty simple--a fact I was slightly disappointed in, as I loved Bionicle movies for their complex storylines. However, it still manages to capture my attention.The story starts with the main protagonists from Bionicle 2: Vakama, Nokama, Nuju, Whenua, Onewa, and Matau. After crash-landing back to Metru Nui to rescue some of the remaining matoran on the island, they discover their city covered with webs and fog. Shortly after are they captured by Visorak: slaves to their king Sidorak and queen Roodahka. Fortunately for the toa, they are placed in cocoons by the Visorak and become the mutated Toa Hordika. Just when they fear they are about to fall to their deaths, they are saved by Turaga-like creatures called Rahaga.The Rahaga leader, Norik, tells the toa many things about their Hordika forms--and even goes as far as to tell them about the legend of a Rahi named Keetongu. Unfortunately for the toa, Vakama leaves them and makes his way out into the strange city he once knew as his home--only to be captured by the Visorak once again. This time, however, he is introduced to Roodahka and becomes pursuaded to work for her as her servant.As the other five toa and Rahaga try to find Keetongu, Vakama grows more and more powerful and evil with time. This all leads up to a big fight in the Coliseum in the center of Metru-Nui.In some ways, the storyline itself is much like the storyline from Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith.Just like with any other Bionicle movie, Bionicle 3 - Web of Shadows perfectly captures its characters' personalities and offers fantastic 3D visuals. Unfortunately, the weak storyline draw me away from it and make it not as good as the first two movies.",4,A Gap Between the Second and First Movies,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,2078,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'third', 'Bionicle', 'movie', 'wondered', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'compared', 'Bionicle', '2', 'Legends', 'Metru', 'Nui', 'piece', 'love', 'dearly', 'even', 'day', 'However', 'seeing', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'began', 'wish', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'had', 'made', 'more', 'complex', 'storyline', 'least', 'longer', 'movie.For', 'Bionicle', 'movie', 'story', 'pretty', 'simple', 'fact', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'loved', 'Bionicle', 'movies', 'complex', 'storylines', 'However', 'still', 'capture', 'attention.The', 'story', 'main', 'protagonists', 'Bionicle', '2', 'Vakama', 'Nokama', 'Nuju', 'Whenua', 'Onewa', 'Matau', 'crash-landing', 'back', 'Metru', 'Nui', 'rescue', 'remaining', 'matoran', 'island', 'discover', 'city', 'covered', 'webs', 'fog', 'Shortly', 'are', 'captured', 'Visorak', 'slaves', 'king', 'Sidorak', 'queen', 'Roodahka', 'Fortunately', 'toa', 'are', 'placed', 'cocoons', 'Visorak', 'become', 'mutated', 'Toa', 'Hordika', 'Just', 'when', 'fear', 'are', 'fall', 'deaths', 'are', 'saved', 'Turaga-like', 'creatures', 'called', 'Rahaga.The', 'Rahaga', 'leader', 'Norik', 'toa', 'many', 'things', 'Hordika', 'forms', 'even', 'as', 'far', 'tell', 'legend', 'Rahi', 'named', 'Keetongu', 'Unfortunately', 'toa', 'Vakama', 'way', 'strange', 'city', 'once', 'knew', 'home', 'only', 'be', 'captured', 'Visorak', 'once', 'again', 'time', 'however', 'introduced', 'Roodahka', 'becomes', 'pursuaded', 'work', 'servant.As', 'other', 'five', 'toa', 'Rahaga', 'try', 'find', 'Keetongu', 'Vakama', 'more', 'more', 'powerful', 'evil', 'time', 'up', 'big', 'fight', 'Coliseum', 'center', 'Metru-Nui.In', 'ways', 'storyline', 'much', 'storyline', 'Star', 'Wars', 'III', 'Revenge', 'Sith.Just', 'other', 'Bionicle', 'movie', 'Bionicle', '3', 'Web', 'Shadows', 'perfectly', 'characters', 'personalities', 'fantastic', '3D', 'visuals', 'Unfortunately', 'weak', 'storyline', 'away', 'make', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'movies']",Bionicle 3 - Web of Shadows
