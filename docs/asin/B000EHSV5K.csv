973084,A3JM17QHAJCOWD,B000EHSV5K,Catherine Gallanti,"[11, 13]","It is sad to think that there will never again be a new episode of Queer as Folk. This is a series that I thoroughly enjoyed, especially during the first three seasons. I loved the daring approach taken by this show towards gay life and sexuality. I also liked all the carachters, some of which, such as Brian Kinney and Emmet Honeycut have kept me fascinated with this show for the duration, thanks not only to the excellece of the writers, but also to the brilliance of the actors. And I enjoyed the music and the cinematography of this show very much.Season five is actually better than season four (which I felt was a little of a let down). The sories were sharper in season five and the carachters more interesting. The only episode I did not like was the very last closing show. I was dissapointed not only with the ending (for a brilliant ending of a similar kind of show, see the last episode of Six Feet Under- much more powerful and moving and hopeful) but also with the quality of the episode itself. The whole of the last episode had a limp feel and the wrap up of the five year story arc of the relationship between Justin and Brian was badly handled. As a viewer I felt kind of cheated by the writers, that after putting us through all of the many ups and downs and the drama of this relationship, then wrap it up in the last episode in a way that feels both unsatisfactory and incongrous with the five year story. Oh well, it is just a show.

I bought all five seasons within a short period of time, and fell in love with all the characters individually. My personal favorites are BRIAN, JUSTIN, and MICHAEL. They are the best in my book.I've been a huge fan and supporter of the brian and justin relationship from day one. I'd always hoped that they'd be together until the end, and kinda...that did happen. I was thrilled when viewing this season that the idea of brian and justin getting married...I was all for it. I just wished that they would've followed through. Justin...why did u leave for NY? Brian was your chance at happiness. He never changed, and you knew him for his true self from day one. He was always honest with you, and never promised you anything that might in the end break your heart. I was so sad during that last episode...well, for many reasons, but mostly because of brian saying goodbye to justin...and them making love for one last time. I cried...I'll admit it. I've grown with that relationship, and I never wanted it to end. I hope and pray that they make a follow-up little reunion type of thing for these characters, and we see that brian and justin are together, just like they should be. I kinda believe they knew they were the best things for each other, and that no one could ever come close to the relationship they could share with each other. I want to see a show like that come along, and that would make me soo soo happy. Buy all 5 seasons of the show..you defidently won't be disappointed.

973086,A2MBF4WWPD470M,B000EHSV5K,Charles J. Mcgeever,"[15, 21]","The final season of Queer As Folk just arrived today, ( June 2nd 2006)and I'd like to break my review down by Disks, if that's alright. I spent 17-straight  hours(LOL) watching  and writing about this DVD.Disk I: episodes 1, 2, and 3.We begin in LA where Justin has been invited to work up the storyboard for  the movie, Rage, he and Michael's comic-book collaboration. The opening scenes of episode one are hot with full and in-focus frontal male nudity and this mise en scene  sets the tone for much of what goes on in LA. Justin, as cute as ever, has some disappointments  that should not surprise anybody familiar with the movie ""biz"" and, back in Pittsburgh, Brian Kinney,  looking a little worn in this his  final season, makes some startling career decisions on the advice of his accounting executive, the (almost) fully rehabilitated Teddy. Emmett Honnecut's business is doing well, too,  and he's even invited to anchor a  TV segment called the ""Queer Guy."" Honnecut isn't very versatile, but he works his character so wonderfully, little versatility is needed.  Michael and  Ben are happy with their marriage and their adopted son, Hunter, is doing well at school. And, of course, there's Michael's sperm-donated daughter who, like most children, is about to cause real trouble.  These three are really an ensemble, although I am tiring a bit of Michael's doe-eyed look and that kind of simpering smile of his as well as  I am tiring of Hunter's James Dean sulleness; it has just about run out of force. Thus, the opening three episodes are funny, well developed in both plot and character, but ominously portending the catastrophes in both plot and theme that are to follow. As one of the Hollywood producers tells Justin in episode one: ""God is in and Gays are out.""Disk II: episodes 4, 5, and 6:I went on to Disk Two and the plot thickens like mucilage or a David Lynch film  These three episodes must have been hijacked by some Jerry Falwell family values devotees or some out-of-work feminists.  Lindsay and Melanie practically suffocate these three episodes with their constant quarrelling over the ""ownership"" of Gus, the male baby, and the other one, baby X, I'll call her.  The theme in these episodes is  repetitive, boring, and nettlesome. The theme:  Gays should adopt traditional heterosexual values such as child rearing, home ownership,  marriage, and, of course, divorce. Everybody, except Brian Kinney, wants to buy into it. If ever there was a low ebb in the five-year run of  QAF, these three episodes are it, and Lindsey and Melanie (and their  two-sperm donated brats contribute to it).  And two men  (one Black and one Caucasian, of course) strolling their ""own"" children down a newly revamped part of Pittsburgh and gentrifying the place smacks of  a real patronizing attitude about what most Gay men actually want to do. It's obvious Disk II wasn't written by the great homo's of earlier seasons and its failures in plot, characterization, believability, and interest to the Gay community are apparent.If one can buy QAF V without Disk II, go for it.Disk III: episodes 7, 8, and 9Somebody else must have got in control of the production here over the previous episodes: the writing is great, the story line  is easy to follow, the characters - especially Teddy (who has never been a favorite of mine) - blossom. (Well, Jason stays pretty static). There's hardly any emphasis on the heterosexual value thingy and just a lot of great fooling around at Babylon, the Gay Super Bar on Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA.  It's great het sex as usual, although the writers are hinting at something ominous with the introduction of a totally anti-Gay  Proposition #14. A Prop that would deny Gays equal rights to  str8ts in legal contracts, marriage, health care insurance from a Gay partner. As in a previous episode where Liberty Avenue had to battle it out againsy discrimination against Gays, Liberty Avenue is at it again. This time, Brian Kinney doesn't come to the rescue.Disk IV: 10, 11, and 12The writers  of QAF built these episodes  nicely and the tragedy is inevitable. Although Cindy Lauper makes her debut at Babylon,  Gay hate takes its toll on our friends and the issue in these three episodes focuses on the extreme Right in America  and what it's willing to do to condemn  or eradicate  homosexuals.  The slurs against President Bush are thinly veiled, and conservatives come off as really  villainous. (I'd like to point out that I am a conservative, but I am not one from the hate-mongering right-wing of the Republican Party.)  I found the editing and the continuity really confusing, however. There are few grammatical hints at what  was  real and what was surreal. No zany camera angles, for instance. No hyped music. Were you watching this in its original broadcast, I know you'd be confused. I had to back up and look at a few scenes, again. Then, it sortta made sense.Episode 13Totally pointless and meretricious. After so many  years of  great stuff, somebody threw this junk together and called it an ending. Pffffft.Conclusion: Like any series, some  parts of  QAF V worked for me and some didn't. In this final season I loved the work of  Carl, Debbie's boyfriend and husband.  I also liked Hunter's work, the street prostitute that Michael and Ben adopted.  Debbie, of course, has gotta be nominated for something in this series.  The music bed was fantastic and Cindy Lauper's appearance in episode #12 was so rip roaring.If you have been a fan of QAF over the years, get this as a collector's item. True. $ seems a mite high priced, but it's the end of an era we'll never see on TV, again.

I think this season is far superior to other seasons in terms of character development and story-lines.  I've watched it through two times now.  The characters come to life in ways you would not have expected and it makes for gripping drama.  Rosie O'Donnell appears in three episodes, creating the character of Loretta, and proves she is as good an actress as she is funny as a comedian.  The ensemble cast, headed by Gale Howard and Sharon Gless, all deserve Emmy nominations for their work in this season's episodes.  My favorite line (paraphrased, as I haven't committed it to memory yet) is from Brian: ""...I'm queer, and if that fills you with pity or disgust, I say JUDGE YOURSELF!""

When you recieve a box set, you tell yourself ""I'll watch an episode by day"" just to keep it as long as possible. Therefore, you get weak and finish by watching the complete serie non-stop. Well it's the same for the season finale of QAF !! It's truly groundbreaking.

973096,AF3L7GVC6T94P,B000EHSV5K,Geminiguy,"[8, 10]","Queer as Folk was a ground breaking show. It brought homosexual sex (gay and lesbian) to the spotlight and it appeared on television. Of course, Show Time is a risque network, but it made the show one of a kind none-the-less. The final season deals with such issues as homophobia/fear of AIDS in highschool, proposed legislation that would strip homosexuals of current rights, age gaps between lovers, people with mental disorders, comming out in the sports world, parenthood, spousal abuse, and a few more. Woven in with the issues are sub plots that continue to develop the characters I have come to cherrish and love. In some cases, the further developments cast some characters in a different light. For example, Michael has always been a bit of a goody goody... but in this season his demenure shifts from that to selfish as he starts to interject his seemingly ""holier than thou"" ideals into everyone else's. The fact that he always had to be right made me view him as the seasons quasi villain because some of his antics did some damage to the other characters lives. Ben earned more respect in three instances... two where he let his emotions take over his common sense and one where he lost control completely and became a fierce fighting machine. To see him become more active was truly a treat and I disagree with another reviewer who said that everyone besides Brian was dull... Ben was pretty interesting too.Ted has his continuing down ward spiral as he gains weight and looses self esteem... only to take maters into his own hands with a radical decision and it completely changes him. The transformation was fun to watch at times but at others it was just too painful to endure. Brian and Justin undergo unexpected changes too... but they don't really reach a head until after a tragic event that shatters all our folksters lives.Of all the characters I truly enjoyed though... from beginning to end... Emmett had me transfixed. He always ahs some interesting stuff happening to him. He becomes a news caster of sorts as PA's Queer Guy... and that causes some inner turmoil for him. He is as flamboyant as ever and always a colorful pressence on screen (so it is even more heartbreaking to watch his personality shift after the tagedy) and he gets to have more fun with Drew, the hard headed football star.I can't say that I found Malanie and Lindsey's story arc all that intriguing mainly because they came off as bitter and self centered... not really able to see past last seasons mistake to the root that they are perfect for each other. Their relationship takes a predictable albeit satisfying route... but it just wasn't entertaining to me.Debbie and Carl were really cute together. The couple looks as if it was made to stand the trials and tribulations... and Carl ahs made a rahter large turn around this season (he even see's Emmett and a fling doing the dirty on accident and still insists that Emmett stay with him and Debbie) Even when Rosie O'donnel steps in and attempts to woo Debbie, I knew it would go nowhere and Carl would be her one and only.There were several upsetting moments this season. One that had me furious takes place at a swim meat for Hunter and is an allegory of sorts to Greg Louganis. The moment was truly a sad one and I felt for Hunter.After the tragedy, everyone seems to go from completely self involved to concerned for each other... which works. Michael and Brian are on the rocks as married bliss threatons single mayhem... and both men seem petty. It shows that it takes a moment to think about what you could loose to turn things around... and this friendship proves to be no exception.Queer as Folk ends on a bittersweet note... one that made me feel sorry for one of the lead characters. Still, it has a decent closer with thumping beats and disco lights to boot... almost like it began. This season ahd some ups and downs... but the human element was always there and the characters all seemed very real. I wish there could be more... but alas... there won't be.

The alternate ending included in the extras would have been more  hopeful and affirming than the one chosen and, despite the contrived `tragedy' central to the last season, we are left cold.The iconic soap opera dwindled down, after two rather spectacular seasons,  to just one thing going for it:  Gale Harold as Brian.  He is handsome, sexy, intelligent, delightfully cynical, interesting, and fun -- qualities that are lamentably absent in other characters.  Justin (Randy Harrison) is truly adorable and genuinely loves Brian, but wanders off from time to time.  All too often, Brian's `best friend', the insufferable Michael, has something to do with it.  As the cliche goes, if you have a friend like this you don't need enemies.Brian and Justin are the heart of the series.  One actually wants to know what will happen to them, and for their relationship to work out somehow.  Theirs is the only honest and, more important, unselfish love in the whole show.  Alas, unselfish is a term that can only be applied to Brian, Justin, and Emmett.Hal Sparks as Michael has been unbearably cloying and controlling from the beginning.  He is just plain hateful now.  His lover is well-built and good-looking, but is ineffectual, self-righteous, and whipped.  Their adopted son is interesting but, on top of his own significant problems, has to deal with theirs.

This New Queer As Folk Season 5 DVD Box Set has all 13 episodes of the fifth and final season. Queer As Folk is destined to be one of the most controversial and bravest TV shows of its time. The BOX SET includes Bonus features such as: Filmographies, Rosie O'Donnell diary, wrap party reel, deleted scenes, photo gallery, and a Music video of Cyndi Laupers Shine. I have seen all 13 episodes of the final season 5 and it is another great and very emotional season. I am still amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Queer As Folk is about the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic sex scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the balls to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show has some issues that are far more real for some than others. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something that we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between. Queer As Folk  has opened the doors for mainstream gay movies like Brokeback Mountain (which received 8 Academy Award Nominations and won 3) and Transamerica. With this season being the final season of Queer As Folk I encourage you all to enjoy this great show because very few shows can touch your heart yet push the limit as far as this show has. I encourage anyone who has a open mind and a open heart to BUY this amazing DVD collection as it will inspire you and if nothing else open your mind to a lifestyle not as uncommon as you may think. Watch more than one episode before you judge this amazing series. I would also highly recommend Queer As Folk Season 1, 2, 3 and 4.One Quick note: The packaging for season 5 is different and not as good as the first 3 seasons, but it is a space saver and so much better than the horrible packaging of season 4.",5,Queer As Folk Season 5 (The Final Season) is finally going to be released in May 2006!,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,2186,"['QUEER', 'AS', 'FOLK', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'TV', 'Shows', 'ever', 'landmark', 'show', 'new', 'millennium', 'New', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'Box', 'Set', '13', 'episodes', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'destined', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'bravest', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'BOX', 'SET', 'Bonus', 'features', 'such', 'Filmographies', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'diary', 'wrap', 'party', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Music', 'video', 'Cyndi', 'Laupers', 'Shine', 'have', 'seen', '13', 'episodes', 'final', 'season', '5', 'great', 'very', 'emotional', 'season', 'am', 'still', 'amazed', 'how', 'honest', 'show', 'dealing', 'gay', 'life', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'life', 'group', 'gay', 'guys', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'living', 'Pittsburgh', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'apologies', 'thats', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'series', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'drama', 'dealing', 'prejudice', 'still', 'America', 'show', 'so', 'brave', 'give', 'big', 'thumbs', 'up', 'having', 'balls', 'take', 'big', 'risk', 'as', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'show', 'issues', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'real', 'others', 'not', 'show', 'just', 'gay', 'people', 'ALL', 'people', 'human', 'emotion', 'thats', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'be', 'straight', 'gay', 'bisexual', 'black', 'white', 'brown', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'opened', 'doors', 'mainstream', 'gay', 'movies', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'received', '8', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nominations', 'won', '3', 'Transamerica', 'season', 'being', 'final', 'season', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'encourage', 'enjoy', 'great', 'show', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'can', 'touch', 'heart', 'yet', 'push', 'limit', 'as', 'far', 'show', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'open', 'mind', 'open', 'heart', 'BUY', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'collection', 'will', 'inspire', 'nothing', 'else', 'open', 'mind', 'lifestyle', 'not', 'as', 'uncommon', 'may', 'think', 'Watch', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'judge', 'amazing', 'series', 'would', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Season', '1', '2', '3', '4.One', 'Quick', 'note', 'packaging', 'season', '5', 'different', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'space', 'saver', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'horrible', 'packaging', 'season', '4']",N/A
973108,A2W1GT509PD228,B000EHSV5K,"Randy ""An Idealistic Realist""","[0, 0]","The final season of Queer As Folk marked the end of an era for me. When I first came out a few years ago, this was one of the first shows I watched. The ensemble cast definitely make the show a tour de force. This fifth and final season wasn't perfect, but it was an amazing, satisfying ending to the show.Throughout the show, Brian Kinney (Gale Harold) was known to sleep with numerous men while attempting a relationship with Justin Taylor (Randy Harrison). This season saw a rift in this like never before, resulting in Justin finally not being able to tolerate Brian's inability to commit and be only with him. Admittedly, Brian's confidence and unapologetic nature have been what made QAF so great, but like Justin, I thought it just got old quickly. As Michael said to Brian in an argument in episode 7 (one of the best in the season and show), &#34;Nothing's more pathetic than an over-the-hill club boy.&#34; Brian's inability to commit and criticism of Michael and Ben for being traitors for settling down is a recurring theme throughout season five, and it's compelling. However, I side with Michael and Justin on this: nothing's wrong with wanting to settle down and have a family, even if you're gay.Other great moments are when Ted gets revenge on an old lover (from season 2), Emmett showing he's tougher than he looks in a fight and the series finale. It didn't end things how I and many fans would've liked, especially in regards to Brian and Justin, but it was a beautiful ending nonetheless. And I wish Brian would've been allowed to change in character more, especially since it has been five seasons. Gale Harold even mentioned this once in criticism of his character. The extras on the DVD are minimal but nice. My favorites are the gag reel and the special message regarding The Trevor Project. The cast truly are one-of-a-kind and a caring bunch.So, here is the ending of five amazing seasons. It isn't as strong as other seasons such as the first and second, but it's definitely still great TV to watch. Not for one moment did I feel like the actors didn't want to be there, such is the case for many other shows after they've been on for many years. So definitely check this out, after you watch the other four seasons of course.",5,"""We Will Survive"" - Michael Novotny",1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,2254,"['final', 'season', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'marked', 'end', 'era', 'When', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'watched', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'definitely', 'make', 'show', 'tour', 'force', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'was', 'amazing', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'show.Throughout', 'show', 'Brian', 'Kinney', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'was', 'known', 'sleep', 'numerous', 'men', 'attempting', 'relationship', 'Justin', 'Taylor', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'season', 'saw', 'rift', 'like', 'never', 'before', 'resulting', 'Justin', 'finally', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'tolerate', 'Brian', 'inability', 'commit', 'be', 'only', 'Admittedly', 'Brian', 'confidence', 'unapologetic', 'nature', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'made', 'QAF', 'so', 'great', 'Justin', 'thought', 'just', 'got', 'old', 'quickly', 'Michael', 'said', 'Brian', 'argument', 'episode', '7', 'one', 'best', 'season', 'show', '34', 'Nothing', 'more', 'pathetic', 'over-the-hill', 'club', 'boy.', '34', 'Brian', 'inability', 'commit', 'criticism', 'Michael', 'Ben', 'being', 'traitors', 'settling', 'down', 'recurring', 'theme', 'season', 'five', 'compelling', 'However', 'side', 'Michael', 'Justin', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'wanting', 'settle', 'down', 'have', 'family', 'even', ""'re"", 'gay.Other', 'great', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Ted', 'revenge', 'old', 'lover', 'season', '2', 'Emmett', 'showing', 'tougher', 'fight', 'series', 'finale', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'things', 'how', 'many', 'fans', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'especially', 'regards', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'was', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'nonetheless', 'wish', 'Brian', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'allowed', 'change', 'character', 'more', 'especially', 'been', 'five', 'seasons', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'even', 'mentioned', 'once', 'criticism', 'character', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'minimal', 'nice', 'favorites', 'are', 'gag', 'reel', 'special', 'message', 'regarding', 'Trevor', 'Project', 'cast', 'truly', 'are', 'one-of-a-kind', 'caring', 'bunch.So', 'here', 'ending', 'five', 'amazing', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'other', 'seasons', 'such', 'first', 'second', 'definitely', 'still', 'great', 'TV', 'watch', 'Not', 'one', 'moment', 'did', 'feel', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'such', 'case', 'many', 'other', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'been', 'many', 'years', 'So', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'watch', 'other', 'four', 'seasons', 'course']",N/A
973109,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B000EHSV5K,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 1]","The fifth & final season of ""Queer as Folk"" did not disappoint. If anything, the producers, writers & cast met their subject matter dead on, with an unfaltering eye. Notable was the ongoing (and incredibly messy) custody battle between Lindsay, Melanie & biological father Michael; the creators smartly realized that situations such as this are not neatly resolved within an episode or two. Repercussions linger long after, and friendships/relationships are put to the test.There were wonderful guest appearances from Rosie O'Donnell & Cyndi Lauper, the latter's participation signalling a bombing at Babylon which changed many lives forever. Most shocking was the 360-degree turnaround of Brian, who changed his ways, rejected promiscuity and made an announcement which made all jaws drop: He was marrying Justin & settling down for good. But as with the custody battle storyline, there are no easy answers as things take a complicated turn.Emmett (who took a fun whirl aa a gay celebrity) helped closeted football player Drew deal with a scandal & embrace his homosexuality; unlucky-at-love Ted (who also boosted his confidence with plastic surgery) got a much-deserved ending by hinting at a possible romantic rekindling with old boyfriend Blake; Debbie flirted with retirement from the diner to spend more time with live-in boyfriend/policeman Karl; and Hunter faced HIV prejudice at school and accepted Michael & Ben's proposal to become their son for good. Concluding this all was an appropriate, heartwarming fadeout as Michael philosophizes that ""we all follow the 'thumpa-thumpa' of life's dance beat. It's what drives us"".There is not a weak performance from anyone in this series, leading or supporting roles alike. It's sad to see this series exit the airwaves. However, it has made such a deep impression in portaying the gay lifestyle with such frankness that other future series will be hard pressed to meet its levels of quality.",5,A fitting end to a landmark series,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,1945,"['fifth', 'final', 'season', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'anything', 'producers', 'writers', 'cast', 'met', 'subject', 'matter', 'dead', 'unfaltering', 'eye', 'Notable', 'was', 'ongoing', 'incredibly', 'messy', 'custody', 'battle', 'Lindsay', 'Melanie', 'biological', 'father', 'Michael', 'creators', 'smartly', 'realized', 'situations', 'such', 'are', 'not', 'neatly', 'resolved', 'episode', 'two', 'Repercussions', 'linger', 'long', 'friendships/relationships', 'are', 'put', 'test.There', 'were', 'wonderful', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'latter', 'participation', 'signalling', 'bombing', 'Babylon', 'changed', 'many', 'lives', 'forever', 'Most', 'shocking', 'was', '360-degree', 'turnaround', 'Brian', 'who', 'changed', 'ways', 'rejected', 'promiscuity', 'made', 'announcement', 'made', 'jaws', 'drop', 'was', 'marrying', 'Justin', 'settling', 'down', 'good', 'custody', 'battle', 'storyline', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'things', 'take', 'complicated', 'turn.Emmett', 'who', 'took', 'fun', 'whirl', 'gay', 'celebrity', 'helped', 'closeted', 'football', 'player', 'Drew', 'deal', 'scandal', 'embrace', 'homosexuality', 'unlucky-at-love', 'Ted', 'who', 'also', 'boosted', 'confidence', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'got', 'much-deserved', 'ending', 'hinting', 'possible', 'romantic', 'rekindling', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'Blake', 'Debbie', 'flirted', 'retirement', 'diner', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'live-in', 'boyfriend/policeman', 'Karl', 'Hunter', 'faced', 'HIV', 'prejudice', 'school', 'accepted', 'Michael', 'Ben', 'proposal', 'become', 'son', 'good', 'Concluding', 'was', 'appropriate', 'heartwarming', 'fadeout', 'Michael', 'follow', ""'thumpa-thumpa"", ""'"", 'life', 'dance', 'beat', 'what', 'not', 'weak', 'performance', 'anyone', 'series', 'leading', 'supporting', 'roles', 'alike', 'sad', 'see', 'series', 'airwaves', 'However', 'made', 'deep', 'impression', 'portaying', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'such', 'frankness', 'other', 'future', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'meet', 'levels', 'quality']",N/A

One thing I didn't mention before is that, though there were no real credits, I didn't really know who the characters/actors were. Now I know them very well, such wonderfully fleshed out characters. Gale Harold is to be commended for playing Brian, with so many layers of intrigue. He is an enigma, which no gay man I know could relate to...though I have known some who though like that. I always liked Ted (Scott Lowell), making his wrong decisions and dealing with them as sadly as only those in his situation can. Emmett (Peter Paige) was the flaming queen with more honest wisdom than any of the others. He was among the most intriguing, and positive. Melanie and Lindsay were the token Lesbians, and had an intense involvement throughout. Randy Harrison (as Justin) grew as his character did; a kid who found the gay community and ran with it, following his own natural direction. He held his own and was endearing. The most sensual moment in the show was when he seduced the school bully (in Season 1). Michael is the most upsetting character, always referred to as uneducated, he over-reacts all the time; as played by Hal Sparks, he's frustrating to watch, but also adorable. His mother, Debbie, played by veteran Sharon Gless, has a fire and power that no one can mess with; proud of her gay son. I still don't know the name of some other wonderful performers: Justin's mother, Ted's lover/therapist, Ted's drug-dealer, Debbie's cop boyfriend, Justin's activist crazy friend; and other remarkable supporting characters. Robert Gant is also quite fine as Michael's HIV lover, though he didn't appear til Season 3. A strong character. I'll miss these people a lot. Maybe the series had run its course, and maybe it ended a little too abruptly, or conveniently (as happens). Showtime is to be commended for giving those who chose to see this side of life. Maybe unrealistic (Pittsburgh?). Here in Milwaukee and Chicago there were lots of places like Babylon, but with the advent of the AIDS epidemic, in the late 80's, those places were all shut down. Ain't the same, and just as well. I'll miss these people, and I hope the actors can be seen in future projects. I especially hope they're not stigmatized by their roles in QAF. These are talented actors who were courageous, and most of them were actually heterosexual. As the series clearly explained, it'll be a long time coming before people will be respected for whom they are...Trying to live together and expecting a bit of consideration, if not respect.",5,Sad end of a wonderful series...,1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,2619,"['have', 'written', 'opinion', 'season', 'can', 'only', 'say', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'demise', 'series', 'One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'before', 'were', 'real', 'credits', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'who', 'characters/actors', 'were', 'Now', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'such', 'wonderfully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'be', 'commended', 'playing', 'Brian', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'intrigue', 'enigma', 'gay', 'man', 'know', 'could', 'relate', 'have', 'known', 'who', 'always', 'liked', 'Ted', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'making', 'wrong', 'decisions', 'dealing', 'as', 'sadly', 'only', 'situation', 'can', 'Emmett', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'was', 'flaming', 'queen', 'more', 'honest', 'wisdom', 'others', 'was', 'most', 'intriguing', 'positive', 'Melanie', 'Lindsay', 'were', 'token', 'Lesbians', 'had', 'intense', 'involvement', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'Justin', 'grew', 'character', 'did', 'kid', 'who', 'found', 'gay', 'community', 'ran', 'following', 'own', 'natural', 'direction', 'held', 'own', 'was', 'endearing', 'most', 'sensual', 'moment', 'show', 'was', 'when', 'seduced', 'school', 'bully', 'Season', '1', 'Michael', 'most', 'upsetting', 'character', 'always', 'referred', 'uneducated', 'time', 'played', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'also', 'adorable', 'mother', 'Debbie', 'played', 'veteran', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'fire', 'power', 'one', 'can', 'mess', 'proud', 'gay', 'son', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'other', 'wonderful', 'performers', 'Justin', 'mother', 'Ted', 'lover/therapist', 'Ted', 'drug-dealer', 'Debbie', 'cop', 'boyfriend', 'Justin', 'activist', 'crazy', 'friend', 'other', 'remarkable', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'also', 'quite', 'fine', 'Michael', 'HIV', 'lover', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'til', 'Season', '3', 'strong', 'character', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'people', 'lot', 'Maybe', 'series', 'had', 'run', 'course', 'maybe', 'ended', 'little', 'too', 'abruptly', 'conveniently', 'happens', 'Showtime', 'be', 'commended', 'giving', 'who', 'chose', 'see', 'side', 'life', 'Maybe', 'unrealistic', 'Pittsburgh', 'Here', 'Milwaukee', 'Chicago', 'were', 'lots', 'places', 'Babylon', 'advent', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'late', '80', 'places', 'were', 'shut', 'down', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'same', 'just', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'people', 'hope', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'future', 'projects', 'especially', 'hope', ""'re"", 'not', 'stigmatized', 'roles', 'QAF', 'are', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'courageous', 'most', 'were', 'actually', 'heterosexual', 'series', 'clearly', 'explained', ""'ll"", 'be', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'respected', 'whom', 'are', 'Trying', 'live', 'together', 'expecting', 'bit', 'consideration', 'not', 'respect']",N/A

973112,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000EHSV5K,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[0, 0]","Well, here it is; the final season ever of my favorite tv series of all-time. ""Queer as Folk"" says goobye after 5 seasons and 83 episodes. There was never a program like ""Queer as Folk"" and there never will be. The final season features the least number of shows, 13. There was suppose to be a 6th season, but the writer's were running out of ideas, and a number of cast members, most notably Randy Harrison, were leaving at the end of the 5th season. Also, I suspect the high cost of production was the main reason the show got axed. The 5th season has some wonderful stories as Hunter battles problems at school when his classmates discover his HIV status, Ted continues searching for Mr. Right and there is a nasty custody battle for Melanie's baby where no one wins. In the middle of the season a bomb goes off at Babylon and we see who survives this terrible tragedy. This incident changes everyone, most notably Brian and Justin's relationship. Cyndy Lauper has an apperance this year and Rosie O'Donnell plays a lesbian who is battered by her husband who ultimately falls in love with Debbie. The final show is a must so I won't give anything away. Also watch the bonus features as it shows scenes cut from the final broadcast episode that are interesting. On a sad note some cast members, like Hal Sparks, have gone on record as saying there won't be a ""Queer as Folk"" reunion movie as a few of the cast members, one gay and one straight, were very hard to work with. The producers also had a problem with these actors as well.My only problem with this collection is I wish they would have included the 30 minute interview they did with the cast prior to the airing of the finale that was shown on Showtime as it was informative, and we get everyone's impression on this being the final year. There is also a complete boxset featuring all 5 seasons, but if you already have the entire series I would pass on buying it, but if you don't have all the boxsets purchase it; it's a great deal.

Look around at all the other Tv Shows that have been released on DVD. Not one of them come anywhere near the asking price of the QAF boxsets and the other tv shows usually have anywhere from 22-25 episodes. The Producers of QAF should be ASHAMED of Themselves for Price Goughing its fans and anyone who would buy this outrageously priced set deserves to be ripped off. Me?

I dont know what to say about this but I must admit that 1st - 3rd kept going into the Babylon all the time but 4th and the final was big different!! But when I watched from first season until the final when I watched the final my heart was broken I cried cried and cried and I really missed QAF (Queer As Folk) and it's very sad it's over. I wish QAF could do some more show. I was so surprised that Brian finally believed in love in the end because I remember Brian said he didnt believe in love only believed in f--king and now look what happened between Brian and Justin and Brian finally asked Justin to marry Brian but Justin had his point and Brian and Justin were in love!!! I am not a huge fan of Justin or Brian I am a huge fan of Michael because Michael and I have almost the same personality. The most sadness I have seen that Michael ended up went to the hospital after the club bombed and I thought positive nothing would happen to Michael. I have cried and cried and cried from this season. I am telling you this is the most BIG different than 1st - 3rd seasons and part of 4th as well.,5,Series 1st - 5th,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,1151,"['have', 'whole', 'series', '1st', '5th', 'Final', 'season', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'must', 'admit', '1st', '3rd', 'kept', 'going', 'Babylon', 'time', '4th', 'final', 'was', 'big', 'different', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'final', 'when', 'watched', 'final', 'heart', 'was', 'broken', 'cried', 'cried', 'cried', 'really', 'missed', 'QAF', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'very', 'sad', 'wish', 'QAF', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'surprised', 'Brian', 'finally', 'believed', 'love', 'end', 'remember', 'Brian', 'said', 'didnt', 'believe', 'love', 'only', 'believed', 'f', 'king', 'now', 'look', 'what', 'happened', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'Brian', 'finally', 'asked', 'Justin', 'marry', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'had', 'point', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'were', 'love', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Justin', 'Brian', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'have', 'almost', 'same', 'personality', 'most', 'sadness', 'have', 'seen', 'Michael', 'ended', 'up', 'went', 'hospital', 'club', 'bombed', 'thought', 'positive', 'nothing', 'would', 'happen', 'Michael', 'have', 'cried', 'cried', 'cried', 'season', 'am', 'telling', 'most', 'BIG', 'different', '1st', '3rd', 'seasons', 'part', '4th', 'as', 'well']",N/A
