I thought he did okay inThe Expendables(he did take out Steve Austin), and wanted to see him in a solo action film.  To be honest this movie was just about what I expected.  Not a great movie, but a low budget action flick.  Randy did not do any worse than say Chuck Norris did in his first couple of films.  But do not expect much more.  I agree with another poster about some of the dumb things Randy's character did in the movie and at one point thought to myself: Who writes these things?  Leaving weapons around and not keeping an eye on a stone killer.  Rookies!  My other gripe was this movie did not have subtitles.  That should have been a sign that is a low budget flick.  I like to have subtitles on so I can read what people are saying.  With the A/C on it sometimes gets difficult to hear what the characters are talking about and if I leave the volume up, I pay the price when the action gets going.

This wasn't his first film, he also had parts in Redbelt, The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior and The Expendables.In Hijacked, Paul Ross (Randy Couture) is a U.S. government agent working to bring down The Tribe (a global terrorist syndicate).The Tribe's next target is billionaire industrialist, Bruce Lieb, who is aboard his own private jet headed to his next power meeting. Also aboard the plane are Paul's ex-girlfriend, who is in public relations and members of The Tribe.The movie dragged a little at the start, before getting to the hijacking. But once it got started it was as entertaining as The Rock's Walking Tall or Cena's The Marine.Hey, this is a low budget action film but it's watchable. There are lots of fights, a bomb, not enough parachutes and all the standard fare.Even though Randy is not the lead character, as in Hijacked, he's pumped about the follow-up to The Expendables, and working with Sylvester Stallone again.""It was remarkable; I had no idea how Sly was still standing after all of that, but I found him to be very refreshing. He wasn't caught up with the words on the page; things changed on the fly -- he rewrote stuff right there on the set a lot of the time, changing around the lines for characters to make it fit better, feel better, and he was very, very in tune with helping the actors get across what he wanted to get across,"" Randy said.",3,Hijacked film offers fairly decent escapism fare,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,1748,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'publisher', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MississippiRandy', 'Couture', 'decided', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'fellow', 'wrestlers', 'John', 'Cena', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'have', 'second', 'career', 'acting', 'fall', 'back', 'on.The', 'retired', 'American', 'mixed', 'martial', 'artist', 'collegiate', 'Greco-Roman', 'wrestler', 'decent', 'job', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'Hijacked', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'parts', 'Redbelt', 'Scorpion', 'King', '2', 'Rise', 'Warrior', 'Expendables.In', 'Hijacked', 'Paul', 'Ross', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'U.S.', 'government', 'agent', 'working', 'bring', 'down', 'Tribe', 'global', 'terrorist', 'syndicate', 'Tribe', 'next', 'target', 'billionaire', 'industrialist', 'Bruce', 'Lieb', 'who', 'own', 'private', 'jet', 'headed', 'next', 'power', 'meeting', 'Also', 'plane', 'are', 'Paul', 'ex-girlfriend', 'who', 'public', 'relations', 'members', 'Tribe.The', 'movie', 'dragged', 'little', 'start', 'getting', 'hijacking', 'got', 'started', 'was', 'as', 'entertaining', 'Rock', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'Cena', 'Marine.Hey', 'low', 'budget', 'action', 'film', 'watchable', 'are', 'lots', 'fights', 'bomb', 'not', 'enough', 'parachutes', 'standard', 'fare.Even', 'Randy', 'not', 'lead', 'character', 'Hijacked', 'pumped', 'follow-up', 'Expendables', 'working', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'again', 'was', 'remarkable', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'Sly', 'was', 'still', 'standing', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'refreshing', 'was', ""n't"", 'caught', 'up', 'words', 'page', 'things', 'changed', 'fly', 'rewrote', 'stuff', 'right', 'there', 'set', 'lot', 'time', 'changing', 'lines', 'characters', 'make', 'fit', 'better', 'feel', 'better', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'tune', 'helping', 'actors', 'get', 'what', 'wanted', 'get', 'Randy', 'said']",N/A

1538950,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007VXTANC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","As a straight-to-DVD action picture, my expectations were fairly grounded for the high-flying adventure ""Hijacked.""  Meant as a vehicle for UFC Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture, he channels his best Jason Statham and comes off as a serviceable action hero.  If you are approaching ""Hijacked"" for him alone, this might be worth a look (but I'd still be hard pressed to recommend a buy).  If, however, you are looking for non-stop action, suspense, and a plot that makes sense--there is less that I can say.  This is an action picture that assembles the requisite cast of good guys and bad guys on a luxury airliner and allows a battle of wills to play out.  Unfortunately, though, every major plot point revolves around seemingly random choices involving both the terrorists and the hostages.  At one point, Couture takes out one of the three bad guys and leaves him unconscious and unsecured to rejoin the fight later on.  Another time he leaves his gun sitting in front of an unsecured villain.  From the bad guys, they don't make much sense either.  Although their plot is to extort money--they instantly kill two of the richest passengers on the plane.  But others, like a flight attendant, they allow to live and escape several times.I'm not sure that the plot really matters with ""Hijacked.""  It's really just a red herring that has little to do with how the movie unfolds.  A spiffy introduction speaks about an international organization called The Tribe, but it's all so over-the-top as to not have much impact.  Next we meet Couture in a cursory mission, a job gone bad.  But before he has time to breathe, he joins his ex-fiancee on this luxury flight as she has just been hired by a wealthy (but suspicious) Vinnie Jones.  I love Jones, I must admit, but he has little to do here.  The movie spends lots of time with character introduction, but it really isn't of consequence as you wait for ANYTHING to begin the action.  In a series of repetitive captures and escapes (seriously, cable ties are cut about 24 times in the movie to free hostages), ""Hijacked"" aspires to be a clever variation on ""Die Hard"" lacking any of that picture's excitement, humor, or smarts.  But if it all isn't bad enough, the movie attempt to surprise with a twist that is cobbled together from several better movies.I didn't hate ""Hijacked,"" I just didn't find it very involving.  Trust me, you've seen it all before and I guarantee you've seen it better!  It gets off to a slow start and then most of the action just made me roll my eyes at the silliness of it all.  If you were sitting at home and ""Hijacked"" came on TV for free, I'd say give it a look if you like this sort of thing.  But I can't imagine wanting to own the film for repeat viewing.  For Couture, he may not be bad but he needs to shop better scripts if he attempts to become the next action break-out star.

1538952,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007VXTANC,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","One can say this about Randy Coutre when it comes to acting: he's a great MMA fighter. Honestly it's not that he's that terrible but yes, he needs plenty of help to pull off most movies he's in. In THE EXPENDABLES he did a great job, especially since his part was rather small. In this film as the central character he needs more help.Coutre stars as Paul Ross, a federal agent trying to track down a secret organization known as The Tribe. This group is responsible for numerous terrorists' bombings and threats that are destabilizing the world. While in Paris he gets information that The Tribe might be about to hijack a plane belonging to wealthy industrialist Bruce Lieb on his way to testify before a tribunal. Meeting the plane and trying to convince him not to go he fails but not before he discovers his ex-girlfriend on the plane. At the request of Lieb he stays on board.Betrayal is the name of the game as Lieb's sister Michelle is working with the group hijacking the plane. Afraid that she won't get her share of the family money, she's working with them as they attempt to extort billions from Lieb by taking the plane and all on board hostage. They might have the co-pilot on their payroll but Lieb has Ross.The size of this plane must be enormous as fights taking place in one part are not heard in another. Gunshots, though silenced, aren't heard either. And no one seems to cross paths walking from one end of the plane to the other. But that's not what the movie is about, it's about action and there is plenty of it.Not only do the good guys have Ross on their side, an old friend named Otto Southwell (Dominic Purcell) is the head of security. He helps Ross throughout the film but if I were him I'd wonder what was up with Ross. Otto gets stabbed, beaten and shot while Ross comes out of the whole thing with a few bumps and scrapes.The movie isn't on the high end of action adventure films but it isn't bad either. The bad guys are easily recognizable and the good guys as well. But a resolution as to who is behind The Tribe is left open making it possible for a sequel. I hope it never happens. I'd much rather see something new and original for Coutre to star in. Perhaps a Scorpion King sequel...wait he's done that. Let's just hope he gets some acting lessons to go along with his physical skills.

Looking snazzy in a tuxedo, cool and cunning. You know he can jump into action and kick some serious butt at any minute, but first he must flirt with the ladies. This opening seems to make a successful case for ol' Vinnie as the next 007. Unfortunately, this is not a Vinnie Jones show and after a rather tedious shootout, Jones disappears from the movie all together.Hijacked is a routine, merely adequate action vehicle for Expendables star Randy Couture. Incompetently Directed by Brandon Nutt, this Nutt seemed to believe in the film's merits as he co-produced as well. Couture, the Washington state born former UFC superstar turned action hero makes a go at his first starring role, I wish I could say he is the next great action star, but I just can't. He is stiff and lacking the essential charisma for that, he has an unkempt look reminisce of Jason Statham,  but is lacking the Stath's virtues. Here, Couture is easily over shadowed by his more experience co-star Dominick Purcell, who gives the film`s best performance.The story is familiar, the plotting strictly by the numbers. The production at least looks good, the first part of the picture is set in Paris, so we get some better than expected locations, not the far too common ugly grays of Eastern Europe, which is cheap to film in. Most of the story takes place on an airplane though, this will make many viewers aware of superior actioners of the past such as Air Force One and Executive Decision. Not too much on the action front either as we much wade through nearly half the movie for it to  really get going, then it precedes to take silly turns with lots of gunfire on the airplane. It all goes on too long, too boot. Finally landing with a you've got to be shitting me ""twist"" ending.

After an episode at a party and a shoot out to introduce the characters, we discover there is a plan involving Bruce Lieb and the terrorist group and it is taking place on his flight tonight!CIA agent Paul Ross (Randy Couture) due to cutbacks, does some freelance work and warns Bruce Lieb. When he discovers his ex-fiancee (Tiffany Dupont) is on board the plane, Paul boards it. At this point it becomes good guys vs. bad guys in a straight forward Seagal type film. During the conflict there are things which appeal to be bad plot continuity points. However unlike a Seagall film these were actually clues for the final twist explained at the end. The film, which was cliche, now becomes clever and leads into a squeal.The plane effect looked fake, either CG generated or a model on a string. How I long for the days of stock footage. Randy is a dull actor in the Statham/Seagall mode. The film needed some humor relief as the dialouge was a bit dry. You really didn't know the film was clever until the end as it lulled you into a sense that this is a poorly written action film. This could have been an enjoyable movie with some tweaking. If you like the Seagal type film, this one can be no worse.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, mile high sex, nudity (Marla Malcolm).",3,YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS....,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,1413,"['film', 'newsreels', 'vast', 'international', 'terrorist', 'group', 'called', 'Tribe', 'news', 'billionaire', 'Bruce', 'Lieb', 'Craig', 'Fairbrass', 'episode', 'party', 'shoot', 'introduce', 'characters', 'discover', 'plan', 'involving', 'Bruce', 'Lieb', 'terrorist', 'group', 'taking', 'place', 'flight', 'tonight', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Paul', 'Ross', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'due', 'cutbacks', 'freelance', 'work', 'Bruce', 'Lieb', 'When', 'ex-fiancee', 'Tiffany', 'Dupont', 'board', 'plane', 'Paul', 'point', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'straight', 'forward', 'Seagal', 'type', 'film', 'conflict', 'are', 'things', 'appeal', 'be', 'bad', 'plot', 'continuity', 'points', 'However', 'Seagall', 'film', 'were', 'actually', 'clues', 'final', 'twist', 'explained', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'cliche', 'now', 'clever', 'squeal.The', 'plane', 'effect', 'looked', 'fake', 'CG', 'generated', 'model', 'string', 'How', 'long', 'days', 'stock', 'footage', 'Randy', 'dull', 'actor', 'Statham/Seagall', 'mode', 'film', 'needed', 'humor', 'relief', 'dialouge', 'was', 'bit', 'dry', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'was', 'clever', 'end', 'lulled', 'sense', 'poorly', 'written', 'action', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'tweaking', 'like', 'Seagal', 'type', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'worse.PARENTAL', 'GUIDE', 'F-bomb', 'mile', 'high', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Marla', 'Malcolm']",N/A

Paul Ross (Couture) is a special agent who is great at his job but not his personal life. He has just broken up with his fianc&eacute; and his best friend just got killed. To make matters worse he has just boarded a plane that his ex is on and it has just been hijacked by people working for the crime lord he is looking for. I have to admit that I had really low expectations for this one. Most wrestler movies are not that impressive and after watching this one I guess same goes for MMA. This is a movie where the writers said he can put a UFC guy in this and have him beat people up, that will make people watch. The sad fact is that that it true. The fighting was good, but the movie overall was totally flat. No emotion, no intrigue and I actually found myself wanting to shut it off or fast forward it. My inner struggle actually helped because my talking to myself not only was more entertaining but made the time go by quicker. I was hoping for ""Air Force One"" meets ""Passanger 57"". I couldn't have been more wrong. On the plus side there is a scene of nudity halfway through...so there is that. Overall, a movie for really hardcore wrestling/mma movie fans. I had to struggle to get through it. I give it a C-.",2,"""Hijacked"" - A long, boring and drawn out movie where the idea is better then the execution.
