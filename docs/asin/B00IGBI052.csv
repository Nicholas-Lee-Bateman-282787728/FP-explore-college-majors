The movie stands by its own as a movie full of hope, true love, a great cast (the chemistry between Alex and Gabriella is undeniable), a great soundtrack, and beautiful photography all along with the film.The movie follows the typical &#34;good girl falls in love with the bad boy&#34; story, but what makes this movie more unique than other teen romance films is how the story is told, you are rooting for (almost all) the characters since the very beginning. You laugh, you cry, you even get angry and shockedat times, the movie is a great rollercoaster that's entertaining from beginning to end, and I see myself watching the movie a lot of times once I get the Blu-Ray.I recommend it to people who are looking for new movies that weren't given the chance when they were on theaters, you're going to love &#34;Endless Love&#34; if you love movies like &#34;The Notebook&#34;, &#34;About Time&#34;, &#34;A Day To Remember&#34;, &#34;Safe Haven&#34;, among others!",5,A new classic,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,1264,"['have', ""n't"", 'loved', 'romantic', 'movie', 'so', 'much', '34', 'Her', '34', 'not', 'old', 'did', ""n't"", 'thought', 'would', 'see', 'romantic', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'soon', '34', 'Endless', 'Love', '34', 'not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'anything', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'harsh', 'reviews', 'comparisons', 'original', 'movie/book', 'movie', 'own', 'movie', 'full', 'hope', 'true', 'love', 'great', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'Alex', 'Gabriella', 'undeniable', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'film.The', 'movie', 'typical', '34', 'good', 'girl', 'love', 'bad', 'boy', '34', 'story', 'what', 'movie', 'more', 'unique', 'other', 'teen', 'romance', 'films', 'how', 'story', 'told', 'are', 'rooting', 'almost', 'characters', 'very', 'beginning', 'cry', 'even', 'get', 'angry', 'shockedat', 'times', 'movie', 'great', 'rollercoaster', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'end', 'see', 'watching', 'movie', 'lot', 'times', 'once', 'get', 'Blu-Ray.I', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'new', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'chance', 'when', 'were', 'theaters', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', '34', 'Endless', 'Love', '34', 'love', 'movies', '34', 'Notebook', '34', '34', 'Time', '34', '34', 'Day', 'Remember', '34', '34', 'Safe', 'Haven', '34', 'others']",N/A
1694151,A130YN8T37O833,B00IGBI052,"Always Samsung ""ravereviews""","[18, 27]","The two lead actors in the role played by Alex Pettyfer (David) and Gabriella Wilde (Jade) have amazing chemistry in this film. This is instant the first time that the two share screen time together. Their first encounter, conversation wise, takes place at David's job where he is a valet employee and parking cars for the rich. Gabrielle immediately longs for him as she senses his lust for her.Anyways, i am not going 2 go in a full length detail about the plot, but its about 2 young lovers who just graduated from high school and never spoke to one another during their time in school. One character is very wealthy while the other comes from a modest working class family. This remake changes things up a bit by making it a class difference that separates the two while the original was an age difference. Jade's character has been a bit of a recluse ever since her brother passed away. Once she meets David, he brings out the passionate side in this beautiful wallflower. Of course, its not always rainbows and butterflies as their are obstacles in the way from Jade's father who is intent on making sure his daughter becomes a successful cardiology doctor. This is a must see film. This wonderful ideal notion of being young and in love for the first time where everything is new and dangerous is captured wonderfully in this film. Being 18 and care free without a worry in the world and facing the unknowns of first time love is portrayed beautifully by the performances delivered by Alex and Gabriella. In fact, all the actors are amazing. All the british actors pull off their American accents without any problems. Alex has become a likable actor ever since he put on some good weight. He was so thin and british in Beastly.I hope the blu-ray version is unrated because there were so many things in the trailer that didn't end up in the movie. Check it out an enjoy.

1694167,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00IGBI052,judy,"[0, 1]","I've always had a soft spot in my critical mind for romantic movies. Honestly, I find it quit difficult to dislike the romance genre, they're always so enjoyable for me. Happy, a term coined for films, but isn't always the case. This film made me happy, and if I wasn't a film critic and just a common movie watcher I'd probably would've given it a 3 1/2 star rating same as 'About Time', but this film when viewed critically isn't very good. It isn't. As enjoyable as it is, I have to set aside my personal genre pleasures and see what the film holds as a whole. It doesn't hold a lot. This is a remake. Remakes have always been meant to only be made when the original film was a disaster, but that has never been the case, ever. I've viewed few films that I could say are better than the originals such as 'Dredd', 'True Grit', and 'The Thing'. Those three films are among a meager amount of remakes I deem better then they're originals. And 'Endless Love' is better than the original. And that's not really setting the bar high, as the original 1981 film was complete garbage. This film makes up for that one, but still is no success story as a whole. My review of 'Endless Love'.'Endless Love' follows Jade Butterfield (newcomer Gabriella Wilde) a highly intelligent, rich, yet socially outcasted girl whose high school years were spent in studies. She has her whole life planned out by her parents (Bruce Greenwood, Joely Richardson) who expect her to attend medical school. She does well in high school and plans to go to an internship for a job in the medical field. Then she meet's David Elliot (Alex Pettyfier) a mechanic's son, who doesn't plan on going to college even with his high grades. They soon fall in love much to the dismay of Jade's father (Greenwood) who immediately dislikes David and seeks to tear him out of Jade's life no matter what.Honestly, 'Endless Love' is a very predictable, underwhelming film. The original, as much as I loathed it, had some pretty good themes in it. However watching this one, it can't help to feel water downed and overly sweet. The script supplies way too many overly clich&eacute;d snippets of cringe worthy dialogue, and fast passes the romantic endure of Jade and David. It can't help but feel unrealistic, it happens too fast.The characters of Jade and David are well supported with a group of talented actors. 'Alex Pettyfier'' who always seems to be seeked out for these roles, yet almost always denies them does a top notch job with what meager he is given. He makes best of what little he has. 'Gabriella Wilde' is a very pretty young lady, and a big sense of realisms to the film, though I just feel that she may have been a bit too pretty. But she does well work with her clich&eacute;d one dimensional character. Pettyfier and Wilde also share good enough chemistry to make this film somewhat bearable. And who doesn't love 'Bruce Greenwood'? Nuff said.Watching this you can't help but feel bored. The film is overly predictable been there seen that. Same one dimensional stereotypical characters, same love story. Nothing added makes you feel any extra ump. You don't truly become attached to the movie the way it wants you to. I blame the screenwriter for the big fault the film holds. He gives us a huge abundance of under developed characters, a ton of clich&eacute;d dialogue, and a story requiring little thought. It's seriously as if the studio hired a 13 year old girl to write the script. That's what it feels like.The music helps a bit to at least get into the romantic mood. It's sweet, catchy, and get's you happy. It adds to emotions when it has to.All and All 'Endless Love' let's down the reliable cast with a overly predictable story filled with clich&eacute;d under developed characters. D+ 5/30/14While I enjoyed the film and my own uncritical opinion would have warranted a C rating (3 stars) that is not what a critic does.'Endless Love' is rated PG-13 for sexual content, brief partial nudity, some language, and teen partying.
