315093,AOEP96629WHHA,6302484286,A. Reid,"[58, 59]","This is a seriously good movie, for those on the search for a serious good movie, but don't go expecting much by way of a plot. With much of it improv, it feels more like a documentary. Like ""survivor for seniors."" What happens if you drop a busload of very old women off in the woods and tell them to fend for themselves?It's all very civilized, and there's not a lot of urgency about it. No pulling straws to see who gets eaten. Just a bunch of old women (and one mildly injured young one) trying to figure out how to divide an apple into 7ths while sharing the details of their lives. The most intriguing, for me, aspect of this film is that the actresses played themselves. Nonagenerian Constance Garneau was really Nonagenerian Constance Garneau, and when she weeps with fear at the thought of her impending death it doesn't feel like acting. Octagenerian Cissy Medding's bewildered grief as she faces her own fear of a life unloved and alone is not feigned.But don't let me mislead you--this movie is not depressing. It's affirming. These old girls get along very nicely with each other and their world, and while there are no answers to the deeper dilemmas they face (we do get the sense that Constance may find hers), they manage their present challenge with an enviable bon vivant. In places, in fact, it's very funny. The interaction between Mary Meigs and Cissy Meddings when Mary reveals her awkward secret is priceless.Good friends, good movie.

315094,A2FNE3CGLVMHB3,6302484286,"Brooke ""islandr1""","[0, 0]","This is obviously not a movie for everyone, but it is my kind of film: real people and an interesting take on such a variety of senior women who are stranded in the middle of nowhere. It has no exciting plot nor are they experienced actors.  It is a simple story with diverse women who let us into their private lives...a little, but not really enough. The photos of each when young was a nice touch and the scenery is beautiful...if you like just forests and a lake of which there are long photoshoots and a discussion between two women about watching birds. Some will find this boring, and I do understand why. It is a slow-moving film with no particular aim but to show how different personalities get along when forced together by a travel-bus breakdown. They hike to find an old house one remembers, and then try to make the best of what is or isn't there for survival until hopeful rescue. It is a serene place, but could be construed as not appealing to many viewers.I found one thing disturbing: I couldn't hear some of the conversation. Some ladies had muted voices and I would have liked to hear everything said. Each conversation must have been interesting, but I got lost in some dialogue.  So, I will watch it again because it is worth another peek into the different senior lives and perspectives presented.",5,"One Big Flaw: ""Muffled""/""Soft Voices.""",1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1321,"['obviously', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'kind', 'film', 'real', 'people', 'interesting', 'take', 'variety', 'senior', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'stranded', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'exciting', 'plot', 'are', 'experienced', 'actors', 'simple', 'story', 'diverse', 'women', 'who', 'let', 'private', 'lives', 'little', 'not', 'really', 'enough', 'photos', 'when', 'young', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'like', 'just', 'forests', 'lake', 'are', 'long', 'photoshoots', 'discussion', 'two', 'women', 'watching', 'birds', 'will', 'find', 'boring', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'slow-moving', 'film', 'particular', 'aim', 'show', 'how', 'different', 'personalities', 'get', 'along', 'when', 'forced', 'together', 'travel-bus', 'breakdown', 'hike', 'find', 'old', 'house', 'one', 'remembers', 'then', 'try', 'make', 'best', 'what', ""n't"", 'survival', 'hopeful', 'rescue', 'serene', 'place', 'could', 'be', 'construed', 'not', 'appealing', 'many', 'viewers.I', 'found', 'one', 'thing', 'disturbing', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'conversation', 'ladies', 'had', 'muted', 'voices', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'everything', 'said', 'conversation', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'got', 'lost', 'dialogue', 'So', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'worth', 'peek', 'different', 'senior', 'lives', 'perspectives', 'presented']",Strangers in Good Company VHS

Their situation changed one magical summer when they became unlikely movie stars. This film is a record of that summer. The viewer is caressed by the presence of these women as they open up and blossom before our eyes on screen.

Bowker ""We Are The Angels We Have ...","[1, 1]","Conceived and directed by award winning Canadian film director Cynthia Scott, this is one of the wisest, tenderest and most beautiful films I have ever seen.  She uses mostly (all???) non professional actors, all seniors and I guess all strangers in real life who improvise dialog and events from their own lives around the plot line.  The plot is about 7 strangers stranded together for a few days in the wilderness after their bus breaks down.  The texture of the film is richly synesthetic and deeply spiritual with a resonant soundtrack of mostly classical music, the sounds of birds and frogs, the splash of water, the rustle of grasses blowing in the wind and  powerful stark Wyeth like images of the fields and lake and broken down buildings where they take refuge. There are long spaces of silence in this film when we see the characters and their surroundings and activities with no dialogue.  These spaces are where the film's real alchemy comes into being. Well into the film, when we have come to know ( and love) each character, she uses photos from each persons earlier life and you realize you are already deeply connected to these 7 beautiful women of great humanity and good will.

We rarely see women of this age on film for any extended length of time, which gives it an intrinsic novelty. These are women from a modest and self-effacing generation; no doubt if a similar film were made ten years from now about a group of Boomer-aged women stranded, it would be much different! The women in this film have been brought up to expect little and be satisfied with humble pleasures. The way they patiently wait and amiably pass the time until they are rescued will die with their generation. The women confess their small pleasures, sorrows and anxieties with each other and treat each other with gentle sympathy.

A beautifully made film. Breathtaking photography of the Canadian  countryside, haunting music, superb acting. The film's more like a  documentary. I wish there were more personal information on the Net on each  of the actors, including their addresses so I could write and tell them how  much they have touched my life through this film.  The film helped me  realize that senior citizens are as human as any youth, just as full of  dreams, hopes, and desires.  That within their old bodies lies an ageless,  undying  spirit, with cravings that will match that of any young person.  The film has helped me prepare for my time when I'll  be an &quot;old  man&quot;.
