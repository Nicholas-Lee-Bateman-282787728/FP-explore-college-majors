They are about action in that unique martial arts style of Jackie Chan. Everything else in the movie provides an excuse for an action sequence.That's why I am giving ""Rumble in the Bronx"" three stars. I wanted action. I got action. What I also received was bad acting from costars, an implausible script and indulgent editing. That's why I am not giving it five stars.The PlotJackie's in town for a wedding in the Bronx. He helps defend a grocery store from violent thugs. Things get complicated when one of the thug girlfriends turns out to be a neighbor he has helped. After Jackie breaks up a few fights, the gang comes after him. The trouble really begins when both the gang and Jackie, separately, get mixed up in a major mob diamond job.Will Jackie save the day, catch the bad guys, and protect the gang members who previously beat him up?Bad actors are part the reason this movies lacks. Honorable mentions go to the woman whose grocery store Jackie protects, the boy in the wheelchair, and to the leader of the gang.Not enough editing was done. Scenes are drawn out beyond their value, including ones with the hovercraft in the street, the girl on the toilet, and even a few fights scenes.

Oh...I won't fault the film for inaccurately portraying the Bronx by shooting the film in Vancouver B.C., nor will I fault it for its awful audio tracking.  Heck!  I won't even fault it for its lack of plot and character development.  Honestly, with a film like this, who cares?  One watches a Jackie Chan film for one reason and one reason alone: to see a martial-arts superstar perform his inventive, funny, and innovative fight sequences from start to finish.  You watch it to see a man perform all of his own stunts, stunts that would make even a professional balk.  In RUMBLE IN THE BRONX, Chan vaults up fences, jet skis on his own shoes, and jumps across a street from one building to another.  That's right, guys.  He jumps from a freakin' building.  No ropes.  No padding.  No nothing.If you are a fan of Jackie Chan movies, you have to check out the movie that allowed him to break into the American market.  It is a classic martial arts film and a lot of fun.  The fight sequences are terrific.  I have seen the film several times and it has never gotten old.  And, as always, you have to stick around for the credits, where we are treated to the outtakes from film.

Mok,"[0, 3]","A note to Jackie:  The stunt may be your trademark, but your strength is in close-quarters combat and choreography.Rumble in the Bronx is lacking precisely in that former element.  Though Jackie Chan's signature is,  supposedly, the death-defying, no-body-double stunt, that is never all that  interesting to watch.  Over the years, directors (including Jackie  himself), have very much latched onto this signature and exploited it to  death, filming the stunts from 12 different angles and yielding to the  temptation, usually, to use all 12 of them.  Police Story was like that,  Mr. Nice Guy was like that, and Rumble in the Bronx is where it falls apart  because of that.  The final hovercraft sequence is overlong, not all that  exciting, and frankly quite boring when the hovercraft gets to its fourth  or fifth location and nothing's been escalated yet.  The curse of the  stunt.  In a good Jackie Chan fight sequence, such as the final fight in  Police Story and the incomparable Drunken Master 2, you sense growing  tension, human conflict, and pain and exultation.  In Rumble in the Bronx,  that's replaced by would-be pyrotechnics, weak acting and badly edited  stunts.  If not for the moments of humour, this one would be pretty  pathetic.Too bad this was Jackie's first U.S. hit.

Jackie Chan has never been involved in any real seriously made films, so those are just things you come to expect (especially when dealing with dubbed verisons).  This is another film thats all about the fun factor, and just having a good hour and half dedicated to some great stunts and chases that Chan goes great lengths to provide.In addition to the dubbing, characters, and lame script, you can pretty much forget the simple plot and still enjoy this film.  Its all about the stunts and fights.  What this film does not have in comparison to other Chan films is one really bold stunt (Supercop or Project A for ex.), or one really good fight (Legend of Drunken Master or Who Am I?)  There are plenty of what I like to call smaller stunts and smaller fights, but there is so much of it throughout the film, that pacing is well done and it is pleaseable entertainment.If you have not seen a Chan film, this is a strong entry to begin with.  Though you may regret it at first after hearing the dialouge and seeing some really goofy characters, the action of Chan that include his real life stunts will easily draw you in.

You may not like every film but I know you like him, how could you not. Especially if you have seen this film right here which is one of the most fun you could ever see. Sure this isn't classic as far as most people are concerned but it is to me. This film which takes place in New York but was filmed in Vancouver showcases everything that is great about Jackie.Ma Hon Keung [Chan] comes to America to go to his uncle's wedding and ends up offering to help out at his uncle's store. Turns out he is selling that store to a lady who accepts Keung's help at the store as well. After an incident involving a local gang and their races down the street he lives on they make their way to the store. This starts off a series of fights between Keung and them as he tries to drive them from the area. Add in some diamonds and some organized crime figures and you have a fun flick full of action.Now for those that don't know this is the movie that really opened Chan up to America as it was his first hit here really. It opened at number one and was a financial success not only here but also broke records in Hong Kong. Chan is amazing here as he always is as his style fits perfect for the crazy story. His humor added into the action makes for a great flick and I always loved that he gets beat up as much as the bad guys in all his flicks, love it.All were great here but it is the action that you come for and the humor as well like I said earlier and it is great. The fights here are great with Chan really taking a beating a some points and then dishing them out at others. I know what you are thinking, classic Chan, and you are right. But also another reason to see a Chan flick is all the ways he uses items and the environment in his fights. Here like always he uses any and everything to his advantage or disadvantage. The gangs may seem a little funny or corny but that just adds to the fun.I highly recommend this movie since it is one of my favorites and one of Chan's most entertaining. Directed by Stanley Tong who most will remember from other Chan flicks like ""Police Stories 3 & 4"" aka ""Super Cop & First Strike"". He attempts major stunts before his actors, he won't ask them to do what he won't. So all in all this is a great flick that I highly recommend to all who are reading this.",5,LOVE THIS MOVIE,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,2419,"['RUMBLE', 'IN', 'THE', 'BRONXIs', 'body', 'planet', 'who', 'not', 'like', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'do', 'exist', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'know', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'Especially', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'right', 'here', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'could', 'ever', 'see', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'classic', 'as', 'far', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'concerned', 'film', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'filmed', 'Vancouver', 'showcases', 'everything', 'great', 'Jackie.Ma', 'Hon', 'Keung', '[', 'Chan', ']', 'America', 'go', 'uncle', 'wedding', 'up', 'offering', 'help', 'out', 'uncle', 'store', 'out', 'selling', 'store', 'lady', 'who', 'Keung', 'help', 'store', 'as', 'well', 'incident', 'involving', 'local', 'gang', 'races', 'down', 'street', 'make', 'way', 'store', 'off', 'series', 'fights', 'Keung', 'drive', 'area', 'Add', 'diamonds', 'organized', 'crime', 'figures', 'have', 'fun', 'flick', 'full', 'action.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'really', 'opened', 'Chan', 'up', 'America', 'was', 'first', 'hit', 'here', 'really', 'opened', 'number', 'one', 'was', 'financial', 'success', 'not', 'only', 'here', 'also', 'broke', 'records', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Chan', 'amazing', 'here', 'always', 'style', 'fits', 'perfect', 'crazy', 'story', 'humor', 'added', 'action', 'great', 'flick', 'always', 'loved', 'beat', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'bad', 'guys', 'flicks', 'love', 'it.All', 'were', 'great', 'here', 'action', 'come', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'said', 'earlier', 'great', 'fights', 'here', 'are', 'great', 'Chan', 'really', 'taking', 'beating', 'points', 'then', 'dishing', 'out', 'others', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'classic', 'Chan', 'are', 'right', 'also', 'reason', 'see', 'Chan', 'flick', 'ways', 'items', 'environment', 'fights', 'Here', 'always', 'everything', 'advantage', 'disadvantage', 'gangs', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'funny', 'corny', 'just', 'fun.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites', 'one', 'Chan', 'most', 'entertaining', 'Directed', 'Stanley', 'Tong', 'who', 'most', 'will', 'remember', 'other', 'Chan', 'flicks', 'Police', 'Stories', '3', '4', 'aka', 'Super', 'Cop', 'First', 'Strike', 'major', 'stunts', 'actors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ask', 'do', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'So', 'great', 'flick', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'reading']",N/A

One night I was flippin through the channels and this movie was on. I could only watch so much of it before I had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off. Sometimes that happens with ""Digital Cable"", but it usually it will right itself in the end. As I watched for about a half an hour I could not take it anymore. I tried everything to fix it including switching channels, turning on and off the TV, and things of that nature. I even went as far as calling Comcast and complaining, but even that was a wasted effort. I eventually had to turn it off because I was a hairs-width away from haymakering Morris.Well, even though Comcast ruined my viewing experience so far, when I was at Blockbuster I decided to give it another chance. I know I mentioned that the lead actor could not act but I thought I could look past this, because it might not be completely his fault. For one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices, or it might be because it's his first movie. Who knows but Howard's mind was made up. ""Rumble in the Bronx"" was to be rented. From what I saw so far on ""Digital Cable"", I possibly found a person I could call my mentor, when I enter the world of stuntmen.When I returned home I threw the DVD in the DVD Player and guess what? The DVD was messed up as well, the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on ""Digital Cable"". I raced back to Blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy, telling them this DVD was broken. I returned home again and tried to watch it. ""WHAT THE HECK!?"" I yelled, ""IS THE WORLD AGAINST HOWARD TUTTLEMAN!?"" You guessed it that DVD was messed up as too. I even tried it out on another DVD Player and it proved to me that the run of DVDs Blockbuster has were all messed up. I got so frustrated that I threw the DVD out the window (I rented it on my father's card so there is no recourse to me).After I cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica, I was still determined to see this movie. I ran up to Best Buy in Troy, and I found a copy. I asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version, hoping that it was a new pressing. I was happy with his answer and purchased it. Well I returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop. I put the DVD in the DVD Player and dimmed the lights. Finally, Tuttleman will have his moment.Well to keep this clean and short, let me say that, that night ended with a baseball bat, three (3) stitches in my hand, a broken window, and a hefty grounding-sentence(we are talking WEEKS here).

The stunts are nowhere near comparable to, for example, the first and last stunt scenes in Police Story I - Jackie at his best.  In Rumble, the storyline is basic, merely a frame for Jackie's action sequences and stunts.  However, it did what it was designed to do - introduce Jackie to the American market, albeit in a watered-down fashion.  And this of course led to Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon - and Rush Hour 2 coming up soon. All this aside, Rumble is an enjoyable Jackie flick and I do recommend it for viewing (whether VHS or DVD).

The thing is, is that after seeing this movie a few times in the first week of owning it, I started to notice some serious downfalls in this movie.First, I can start off by pointing out that this movie has almost the exact same soundtrack as Police Story's 1,2 &amp; 4 (Police Story 4 is AKA First Strike), and Mr. Nice Guy.  While I enjoy composer J. Peter Robinson's music very much, enough can be enough.  I also noticed that the end of the movie was a bit abrupt, with no big end finale fight scene.  While I did hear that Jackie breaking his ankle on the jump was why a final fight scene which was planned for the movie did not appear, and while I won't blame anyone for that, but it is still a letdown.Soon I looked closer at the action.  I soon began to realize that the battle in the store, the first battle in the movie, is actually the most convincing of them all.  While the battle in Tony's base was quite spectacullarly planned and executed, the hits themselves just didn't seem real until Jackie picked up the ski, saving both himself and the scene.  Not to mention, while all the actors are decently convincing, almost all are generally rather weak; all except Jackie, who did a rather solid performance here.It should also be made aware that the non-action scenes are quite important to the movie.  Whenever I have a rough day, I sometimes turn on Dragons Forever, or Operation Condor, and pretend that I am Jackie and the people responsible for my long day are the people he beats up, as I skip from action scene to action scene.  This movie somehow doesn't allow you to.  I think it's because the movie isn't about the fights between Jackie and the gangsters, but the fact that they are so bruttally stalking and terrorising him because he has the courage and strength to fight back.  The action-based attitude is the movie, not the action.However, put all downsides aside, and this is a very cool movie.  It told a decent enough story, and the characters were all well developed.

I've been a Jackie Chan admirer since I first saw ""The Cannonball Run"" way back in 1981, but this was the first Chan movie I saw on the big screen.  It's not moviemaking as fine art, it's moviemaking as fine fun.An action comedy, ""Rumble in the Bronx"" features Jackie in the big city, New York (actually Vancouver, with mountains visible in the background in several scenes).  It's a strangely clean and orderly version of the Big Apple, but no matter.  Pretty soon, Our Man Chan fights a motorcycle gang, protects a store, helps a girl and her wheelchair-bound little brother, and pilots a hovercraft in a surprisingly uplifting ending.Fresh and colorful, ""Rumble"" won't please the arthouse crowd, and probably doesn't even rank with Jackie's top flicks; I'll leave that for the hardcore Jackie fans to decide.  But Jackie's joy in his work is contagious, and here, he's at his good-hearted best.

29126,A1B8HI3VREI1H3,0780619331,Jorge A. Zarco,"[1, 1]","Rumble in the Bronx(1995) was a Jackie Chan movie from the 1990's. The USA/New Line Cinema release of this film in the Spring of 1996 helped Chan finally gain stardom in the US and many other countries. The acting, costumes and locations are poor, but the action scenes are excellent and help save the film from being a turkey. Some of the humor in the film works.The film uses Chinese and Canadian actors and stunt performers. The Hong Kong version was longer and it had a moody, downbeat music score. Chan sang a Cantopop song during the outtake reel. The US version uses a punk rock song by Ash during the credits. J. Peter Robinson was hired to compose an energetic music score for the film's US release. The late Anita Mui and the late Bill Tung co-star. Francoise Yip plays a gangmember's girlfriend. In the film, Ah Keung(Chan) tries to protect his uncle's shopping center from low lives. Ah Keung, his friends, and the low lives are in danger as armed mobsters search for missing diamonds. The film abruptly ends in a cartoonish way. The multi-racial gangmembers in the film are goofy and stereotypical. Rumble in the Bronx is not Chan's best film, but it is more fun than The Big Brawl(1980) and The Protector(1985).",3,Rumble in the Bronx(1995),1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,1225,"['Rumble', 'Bronx', '1995', 'was', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', '1990', 'USA/New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'release', 'film', 'Spring', '1996', 'helped', 'Chan', 'finally', 'gain', 'stardom', 'US', 'many', 'other', 'countries', 'acting', 'costumes', 'locations', 'are', 'poor', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'help', 'save', 'film', 'being', 'turkey', 'humor', 'film', 'works.The', 'film', 'Chinese', 'Canadian', 'actors', 'stunt', 'performers', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'version', 'was', 'longer', 'had', 'moody', 'downbeat', 'music', 'score', 'Chan', 'sang', 'Cantopop', 'song', 'outtake', 'reel', 'US', 'version', 'punk', 'rock', 'song', 'Ash', 'credits', 'J.', 'Peter', 'Robinson', 'was', 'hired', 'compose', 'energetic', 'music', 'score', 'film', 'US', 'release', 'late', 'Anita', 'Mui', 'late', 'Bill', 'Tung', 'co-star', 'Francoise', 'Yip', 'gangmember', 'girlfriend', 'film', 'Ah', 'Keung', 'Chan', 'protect', 'uncle', 'shopping', 'center', 'low', 'lives', 'Ah', 'Keung', 'friends', 'low', 'lives', 'are', 'danger', 'armed', 'mobsters', 'search', 'missing', 'diamonds', 'film', 'abruptly', 'cartoonish', 'way', 'multi-racial', 'gangmembers', 'film', 'are', 'goofy', 'stereotypical', 'Rumble', 'Bronx', 'not', 'Chan', 'best', 'film', 'more', 'fun', 'Big', 'Brawl', '1980', 'Protector', '1985']",N/A

He does what I can only classify as the most amazing fighting you will ever see. What makes his fighting so unique is the fantastic speed, creativity and humor that go into it. As if that weren't enough to knock you out it is his winning smile and good heart that will amaze you even more.  What will furthur slay you even more is when you see the outtakes at the end of the picture.  He never uses a stuntman and he does some really dangerous stuff and actually gets hurt pretty bad on occasion all because he wants you to be totally entertained. In one outtake after he has broken his foot you will see they make him a fake cast to look like a tennis shoe so he can still do a crazy stunt where he gets dragged by a boat. Its insane but no matter what happens he always comes up smiling. People love him because they know that is always him putting it all out on the line for you. Anyway if all you have seen is American Jackie Chan films, please rent or buy Rumble in the Bronx. You are missing out on so much.(If you don't mind subtitles, his great Chinese film Drunken Master just became avalilable)",5,Only seen Rush Hour?

29148,A16GGCDUETTTDB,0780619331,T-Man,"[5, 8]","First of all, yes, this film was made in Vancouver, with only a few shots of the Manhattan skyline. When Golden Harvest was making this film, they had to try their best to shoot at angles that didn't show any mountains, and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night. Then Jackie Chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action.Well, action was what they focused on the most indeed. It sure is funny to see how the Chinese thought of the United States at this time, because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls. You also get multi-ethnic gangs trashing places (seriously, the gang has a Native American with pigtails and a frayed jacket! That's almost offensive). You have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars. You have random, small-crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits! Bizarre indeed.As for the actions, this film has some of his best. The first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb, and graceful, using his jacket to dispatch enemies, and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over. He takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered, very impressive. This leads to a scene where he's being chased around the streets of New York, where the entire gang, on motor cycles, try to run him over, and Jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey. He also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building. No harness or wiresupport! The fight scene at the gang's hideout is also one his best, using whatever object he can get his hands ont, and very acrobatic. Also, Jackie Chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land! Some of this was done on a broken ankle!If this DVD was uncut and undubbed, and had the original score, I'd give it a total of three stars. Unfortunately, for a so-so film, New Line makes it worse. Some of the dubbing is very bad. It seems as if New Line dubbed some of the original English dialouge also. Only very, very little of the original Cantonese dialouge is there. Also, the film's original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock. Many, many scenes were cut from the original movie. Not only that, but some of the action scenes were cut too.Try and find an uncut version out there. This DVD you should stay away from.UPDATE: The best DVD out there is Warner Brother's Japanese version. It will give you the entire film undubbed and uncut (minus the scene where Nancy and Keung escape from the nightclub and Nancy pushes over the gang's motorcycles). It has no English subtitles, but it shouldn't matter. It is nice to hear all the actors' original voices, the original score, and all of the fight scenes uncut.",1,This movie sure is a wierd protrayal of America,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,2843,"['First', 'yes', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Vancouver', 'only', 'few', 'shots', 'Manhattan', 'skyline', 'When', 'Golden', 'Harvest', 'was', 'making', 'film', 'had', 'try', 'best', 'shoot', 'angles', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'mountains', 'had', 'paint', 'grafitti', 'day', 'unpaint', 'night', 'Then', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'told', 'simply', 'forget', 'focus', 'action.Well', 'action', 'was', 'what', 'focused', 'most', 'indeed', 'sure', 'funny', 'see', 'how', 'Chinese', 'thought', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'hippies', 'drive', 'trucks', 'full', 'beach', 'balls', 'also', 'get', 'multi-ethnic', 'gangs', 'trashing', 'places', 'seriously', 'gang', 'Native', 'American', 'pigtails', 'frayed', 'jacket', 'almost', 'offensive', 'have', 'fat', 'cops', 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'smoking', 'cigars', 'have', 'random', 'small-crowd', 'rock', 'concerts', 'where', 'everyone', 'dressed', 'up', 'animal', 'suits', 'Bizarre', 'indeed.As', 'actions', 'film', 'best', 'first', 'fight', 'scene', 'grocery', 'store', 'supurb', 'graceful', 'using', 'jacket', 'dispatch', 'enemies', 'endlessly', 'hitting', 'same', 'guy', 'nose', 'over', 'entire', 'gang', 'back', 'alley', 'getting', 'cornered', 'very', 'impressive', 'scene', 'where', 'being', 'chased', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'entire', 'gang', 'motor', 'cycles', 'try', 'run', 'Jackie', 'must', 'rely', 'ability', 'run', 'wind', 'climb', 'monkey', 'also', 'dangerous', 'stunt', 'where', 'roof', 'parking', 'garage', 'fire', 'escape', 'building', 'harness', 'wiresupport', 'fight', 'scene', 'gang', 'hideout', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'using', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'ont', 'very', 'acrobatic', 'Also', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'cling', 'hovercraft', 'water', 'land', 'was', 'done', 'broken', 'ankle', 'DVD', 'was', 'uncut', 'undubbed', 'had', 'original', 'score', ""'d"", 'give', 'total', 'three', 'stars', 'Unfortunately', 'so-so', 'film', 'New', 'Line', 'worse', 'dubbing', 'very', 'bad', 'New', 'Line', 'dubbed', 'original', 'English', 'dialouge', 'also', 'Only', 'very', 'very', 'little', 'original', 'Cantonese', 'dialouge', 'there', 'Also', 'film', 'original', 'score', 'been', 'redone', 'more', 'orchestrated', 'score', 'slight', 'rock', 'Many', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'original', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'too.Try', 'find', 'uncut', 'version', 'there', 'DVD', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'from.UPDATE', 'best', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'Japanese', 'version', 'will', 'give', 'entire', 'film', 'undubbed', 'uncut', 'scene', 'where', 'Nancy', 'Keung', 'escape', 'nightclub', 'Nancy', 'pushes', 'gang', 'motorcycles', 'English', 'subtitles', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'nice', 'hear', 'actors', 'original', 'voices', 'original', 'score', 'fight', 'scenes', 'uncut']",N/A
29149,A55TEBW8H4PYN,0780619331,Trevor R. Raichura,"[0, 0]","First, a disclaimer. If you take your cinematography seriously, if you are looking for good acting and a realistic story, this is not the movie for you. But if you enjoy slapstick comedy and a martial arts expert who pushes creativity to a higher level than anyone else, then Jackie Chan's Rumble in the Bronx is the movie for you!The premise of the story is as follows: a young man flies in from Hong Kong to attend his uncle's wedding and to help him with the sale of his store. But during these events, a gang terrorizes the new store owner and causes a ruckus in Keung's neighborhood. Being the noble character that he is, Keung (Jackie Chan's character) defends the store, stands up to the gang, and as a result, winds up getting into a lot of trouble. But what will he do when the gang leader's girlfriend happens to be a neighbor that he has helped out in another situation? Which side will he take?The action scenes in this film are phenomenal. Jackie Chan outdoes himself in using various items to defend himself and the helpless people of New York. The stunts are highlighted by his jump from one building to another (across a street, without cables or safety nets)! He even performed some of the final scenes on a broken ankle, including one in which he waterskis without the help of skis! The man is incredible!This was the first Jackie Chan movie I had ever seen, but despite its silliness, he had me hooked! I recommend this movie highly to anyone who just wants to be entertained.
