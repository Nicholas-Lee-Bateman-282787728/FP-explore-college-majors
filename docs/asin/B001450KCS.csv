My husband and I were hooked from the beginning and there was no bad parts of this movie. It had all of the intrigue of the culture along with the momentous blossoming of love between the two main characters - both are stunningly beautiful people - who were in an arranged marriage to solidify their countrymen. To watch how they fell in love and the ultimate love scene - with no sex - was so much more romantic with the visual and musical stimulation that it took your breath away.

Jodhaa Akbar is a great exception. It's epic on the scale of Gladiator or Lawrence of Arabia. The movie follows the first years of the famous Mughal Emperor Akbar and particularly his relationship with his wife Jodhaa. The battles aren't really the focus of the movie but are pretty well done. More importantly, you get the sense that there is a real and budding relationship between Akbar and Jodhaa. The political intrigue is great, with brothers betraying each other and parents marrying their daughters off.

He was recently quoted as saying, ""I do not want to be amidst mediocrity."" I like him for saying that. After Dhoom 2, he perhaps wanted to break away from the ""cool guy"" image and do something a bit more Braveheartish or oulandish. A million people awaited this film in my city alone. The audience looked a bit trapped and worried during the interval wondering what the second half would bring.It is an extraordinarily long film and unlike Lagaan, it doesn't really captivate as it becomes a tad too self involved with it's ""epic romance"" genre. That said, I must credit Aiswarya Rai on quite a good performance. The rest of the star cast were ok, there were a few new acts and due to similar faces, it also became a difficult to keep track with the them and the storyline, which in itself isn't all that intriguing.There was some hunky dory chemistry between Hrithik and Aish. A bollywood film is nothing without the music and the songs, each and every one of them, were/was very good. But then tell me...have we not seen this before in nother films? JA will appeal to a certain audience while I can't help but feel it insulted my blind trust in a Hrithik Roshan film.While Hrithik's act is good, I usually expect excellence from him, so he was a bit disappointing. Am I being cynical, I don't know, but this film is really really average.When you're watching a film based on a king, you expect to see a bit more prudence on part of the film-maker with regards to how the king rules, his administration, his ways, his character pecularities, this film is short-sighted when you take into account what Akbar, the king was. Now, come on, I know it's supposed to be a different genre but quite apologetic considering little was incorporated of that.I think this film will bomb but it's ok, one must learn.Do watch this film but don't even expect an ""Alexander"" (which was slighty above average mind you) [...] says it's an 8/10, I'd say barely 6.Regards,HSA",3,What was this all about?,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,2077,"['Hrithik', 'been', 'favourite', 'lot', 'Indian', 'actors', 'let', 'tell', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'are', 'rest', 'was', 'recently', 'quoted', 'saying', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'amidst', 'mediocrity', 'like', 'saying', 'Dhoom', '2', 'perhaps', 'wanted', 'break', 'away', 'cool', 'guy', 'image', 'do', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'Braveheartish', 'oulandish', 'million', 'people', 'awaited', 'film', 'city', 'alone', 'audience', 'looked', 'bit', 'trapped', 'worried', 'interval', 'wondering', 'what', 'second', 'half', 'would', 'bring.It', 'extraordinarily', 'long', 'film', 'Lagaan', ""n't"", 'really', 'captivate', 'tad', 'too', 'self', 'involved', 'epic', 'romance', 'genre', 'said', 'must', 'credit', 'Aiswarya', 'Rai', 'quite', 'good', 'performance', 'rest', 'star', 'cast', 'were', 'ok', 'were', 'few', 'new', 'acts', 'due', 'similar', 'also', 'became', 'difficult', 'keep', 'track', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'intriguing.There', 'was', 'hunky', 'dory', 'chemistry', 'Hrithik', 'Aish', 'bollywood', 'film', 'nothing', 'music', 'songs', 'one', 'were/was', 'very', 'good', 'then', 'tell', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'films', 'JA', 'will', 'appeal', 'certain', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'insulted', 'blind', 'trust', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'film.While', 'Hrithik', 'act', 'good', 'usually', 'expect', 'excellence', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'Am', 'being', 'cynical', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'really', 'really', 'average.When', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'based', 'king', 'expect', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'prudence', 'part', 'film-maker', 'regards', 'how', 'king', 'rules', 'administration', 'ways', 'character', 'pecularities', 'film', 'short-sighted', 'when', 'take', 'account', 'what', 'Akbar', 'king', 'was', 'Now', 'come', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'different', 'genre', 'quite', 'apologetic', 'considering', 'little', 'was', 'incorporated', 'that.I', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'bomb', 'ok', 'must', 'learn.Do', 'watch', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'expect', 'Alexander', 'was', 'slighty', 'above', 'average', 'mind', '[', ']', '8/10', ""'d"", 'say', 'barely', '6.Regards', 'HSA']",Jodhaa Akbar

1145239,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B001450KCS,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[3, 4]","Director Ashutosh Gowariker--who helmed the Oscar-nominated 'Lagaan' (2001)--transports audiences to another world--a world of courtly romance, legendary battles, and palace intrigue--the 16th-century world of one of history's most fascinating figures, the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great. But 'Jodhaa Akbar' is more than a lavish period piece with sumptuous sets and rich costumes, and more than a love story between captivating characters. Its focus is the Muslim emperor's noble goal of religious tolerance--which was the impetus for his conquest of the Indian subcontinent and his marriage to the Hindu princess Jodhaa.Akbar the Great was one of the most progressive leaders the world has ever known, and under him, Indian culture flourished. His marriage to Jodhaa--an important political alliance--is an historical fact, but her actual name is a matter of dispute and the details of their relationship are unknown. It's unlikely that they actually shared a great love, as the film purports, given that Akbar had hundreds of wives and concubines and Jodhaa was not even the first among them--a reality the film completely ignores. But no matter--the film's message that differences can be transcended by respect is a powerful one, sadly all too relevant today, and their marriage, loveless or not, was an important first step in making religious solidarity his public policy.The early years of Akbar's reign are the subject of the film. Akbar (played by Hrithik Roshan) is a young man who has been king since he was a child. He dismisses his regent and assumes control of the government, but he's unsure of himself. While praying, Akbar has an epiphany about how to unite the religious factions in his empire and he makes the controversial decision to marry a Hindu princess. Jodhaa (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) is resistant to the idea, but she agrees to the marriage because he's going to let her keep her religion.Akbar is soon besotted with his feisty, willful bride, but Jodhaa doesn't feel the same way and she keeps him out of her bedroom. He tries to coax her into consummating their marriage by patiently earning her trust and--the film isn't all earnest idealism--by showing off his incredible body. Meanwhile, palace insiders, who would like the country to remain religiously divided, keep trying to drive them apart.The later years of Akbar's reign--and his contentious relationship with his son Salim--are the subject of the Bollywood classic 'Mughal-E-Azam' (1960), starring Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, and Prithviraj Kapoor.- The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",5,Must See,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,2627,"['Director', 'Ashutosh', 'Gowariker', 'who', 'helmed', 'Oscar-nominated', ""'Lagaan"", '2001', 'transports', 'audiences', 'world', 'world', 'courtly', 'romance', 'legendary', 'battles', 'palace', 'intrigue', '16th-century', 'world', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'fascinating', 'figures', 'Mughal', 'emperor', 'Akbar', 'Great', ""'Jodhaa"", 'Akbar', 'more', 'lavish', 'period', 'piece', 'sumptuous', 'sets', 'rich', 'costumes', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'captivating', 'characters', 'focus', 'Muslim', 'emperor', 'noble', 'goal', 'religious', 'tolerance', 'was', 'impetus', 'conquest', 'Indian', 'subcontinent', 'marriage', 'Hindu', 'princess', 'Jodhaa.Akbar', 'Great', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'progressive', 'leaders', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'Indian', 'culture', 'flourished', 'marriage', 'Jodhaa', 'important', 'political', 'alliance', 'historical', 'fact', 'actual', 'name', 'matter', 'dispute', 'details', 'relationship', 'are', 'unknown', 'unlikely', 'actually', 'shared', 'great', 'love', 'film', 'given', 'Akbar', 'had', 'hundreds', 'wives', 'concubines', 'Jodhaa', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'first', 'reality', 'film', 'completely', 'matter', 'film', 'message', 'differences', 'can', 'be', 'transcended', 'respect', 'powerful', 'one', 'sadly', 'too', 'relevant', 'today', 'marriage', 'loveless', 'not', 'was', 'important', 'first', 'step', 'making', 'religious', 'solidarity', 'public', 'policy.The', 'early', 'years', 'Akbar', 'reign', 'are', 'subject', 'film', 'Akbar', 'played', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'king', 'was', 'child', 'regent', 'control', 'government', 'unsure', 'praying', 'Akbar', 'epiphany', 'how', 'unite', 'religious', 'factions', 'empire', 'controversial', 'decision', 'marry', 'Hindu', 'princess', 'Jodhaa', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'Bachchan', 'resistant', 'idea', 'marriage', 'going', 'let', 'keep', 'religion.Akbar', 'soon', 'besotted', 'feisty', 'willful', 'bride', 'Jodhaa', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'bedroom', 'coax', 'consummating', 'marriage', 'patiently', 'earning', 'trust', 'film', ""n't"", 'earnest', 'idealism', 'showing', 'off', 'incredible', 'body', 'Meanwhile', 'palace', 'insiders', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'country', 'remain', 'religiously', 'divided', 'keep', 'trying', 'drive', 'apart.The', 'later', 'years', 'Akbar', 'reign', 'contentious', 'relationship', 'son', 'Salim', 'are', 'subject', 'Bollywood', 'classic', ""'Mughal-E-Azam"", '1960', 'starring', 'Dilip', 'Kumar', 'Madhubala', 'Prithviraj', 'Kapoor.-', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",Jodhaa Akbar

It is also about a great and good ruler who is wise, caring and had unusually high principles for his times..It is sumptuous and shot in some stunning palaces and sets.There are some battle scenes but they are short and symbolically violent rather than going on about realism as Hollywood seems to prefer (and I avoid thesedays). Some may not like the lack of realsim in that but frankly I got the point long ago about war and I dont need to see gut-wrenching images to drive that point further home. This isnt about war even though old power struggles and conspiracies are part of the times and woven in.The ending is satisfying and the film reminds you about the higher points of being loving, wise and evolved as a human being.The music is more subtle and traditional and Hithrik doesnt get to dance yet the music is also evocative and I tracked it down for its own merits even though I usually prefer the upbeat catchy Indian music. Hrithik is just so well cast here and does an incredibly good job. He won many awards for this portrayal and deserved them.

1145246,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B001450KCS,Marc Cabir Davis,"[32, 34]","Watching this instant masterpiece from India, its unbelievable that the world has yet to take note of the industrys' obvious genius. ""Jodhaa Akbar"", a 3.5 hour long epic that works both as a love story, as well as a religious tolerance message, is prime example of how Bollywood is infinitely more creative, colorful and luminous than Hollywood. The film takes us back to the times when movies like ""Gone with the Wind"" were made - but with better looking actors, better music, better direction, and a budget that could sink the Titanic.My favorite thing about this movie is Aishwarya Rai (now Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan). This is an actress who starred in this decades' best Hindi film thus far (""Devdas""), and also headlined the best Bengali film of the decade (the underrated ""Chokher Bali""). I saw it for her, and rediscovered the worlds' most beautiful woman. Seriously, is she even human? Aishwarya is beyond a perfect being - its as if the heavens and the stars and some alien DNA all combined to create one spectacular vision. Take it from me - no human woman, before or after, will ever look as good as Aishwarya does in this film. And re-reading that line, Im afraid it still doesn't do justice to her unsurpassed beauty. Indian women are where its at.Hrithik Roshan plays the King Akbar, but I found much to like about this otherwise wooden actor. The film has a few scenes that stand out way after the movie is over, and if you're into researching and studying film as a passion or a hobby, this movie is tailormade to cater to your sensibilities. Despite both actors being in their mid-30s, their unique love story burns with the incandescence of a teenage romance. The director is especially successful in providing different shades to the character of Jodhaa - Aishwarya goes from warrior princess who excels at sword-fighting, to a bhajan-singing housewife - all within an hour. The scene where she faces off with her mother in law over who rules the kitchen (and thus the heart of her man) is my special favorite.Ultimately, the film succeeds for me because its not frivolous. It would have been so easy to make a beautiful looking movie and doll it up, but this one actually has a message. However, if you're not Indian and you're reading this review, the magnitude of the films' message would perhaps be lost upon you. The fact that a conservative Hindu princess entered a completely Muslim household almost 500 years ago is utterly fascinating. How did she survive there? Did they try to convert her to Islam? The movie addresses all this. I loved how the Jodhaa character refuses to accept Islam as her own religion, though she respects it from afar. The couple get married with Hindu and Muslim rites, one after the other, and the story chronicles how the fact that they came from two different religions had nothing to do with what they felt for each other.The music - well, this soundtrack admittedly has no standout tracks upon first listen, and you simply have to watch the film to appreciate the album. Its mood music, and Rahman has done a wonderful job at it. The track where Jodhaa and Akbar consummate their marriage is unique and touching, primarily because of the way its shot. Gowariker, as ever the perfectionist extracts nuanced performances from all concerned. But the film belongs ultimately to Aishwarya Rai, who proves beyond a doubt that she is the most luminous actress on screen in any part of the world. Yes, she isn't a seasoned actress like Meryl Streep, but look at her. What eyes! What lips! What a fascinating specimen of how incredible human genes can be! Her role as Jodhaa propelled her, in my mind, to the very top of the list of actresses in the world today who are actually worth watching.A five star epic? Yes. Its not better than other Indian classics such as ""Mughal E Azam"", but this is easily the best film India has released in the last twenty years. I highly suggest you track this down and watch it on the big screen while you can, because its worth every second of it. I'll certainly be buying the DVD as well as the CD - this is a film to watch with your family - and put it on repeat.

1145250,A1YLU9NT0Q9H1V,B001450KCS,MJC,"[1, 1]","WONDERFUL...BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES & CINEMATOGRAPHY. Loved the wide-angle shots that gave a sense of locale & emphasized the beautiful interiors.  Aerial shots accentuated the dance formations & elegant floors. Admirable performances by main actors.  I hadn't seen any Bollywood or period Indian movies before...this was VERY impressive.  The many extras and sense of grandeur reminded me of epics from the Golden Age of Hollywood like ""The Ten Commandments"".  Despite being over 3 hrs long, the film is riveting and you forget the time.The story is about the historical figure, Jalal Mohammed Akbar (Hrithik Roshan), a wise 16th-century Indian  ruler who unites Hindustan.  When he assumes full power as Mughal emperor at 19 y/o he displays wisdom & compassion combined with strategic planning & discipline.  Jalal, who is Muslim, agrees to a marriage of alliance to promote peace.  His betrothed is the Hindu Princess Jodha of Amer (Aishwarya Rai).  This introduces two of the movie's themes: 1) religious conflict (Muslim vs. Hindu) and 2) the blossoming love between Jalal & Jodha.  The importance of religion in daily life is an integral part of this film.  Jalal shows his wisdom by decreeing tolerance of all religions, not only Islam.  Of course, there are the usual palace intrigues and plots to contend with.  Meanwhile, tension and passion build as love grows between Jalal & Jodha.  When they finally consummate their love the scene is superb!  The incredible lighting & interior combined with tenderness b/w the two actors make the scene intensely sensual (without the overt sexuality often seen in this type of scene - which is a refreshing change).  Roshan & Rai are gorgeous, adding to the beauty of the film...In fact, Roshan is probably one of the most handsome & charismatic men I have seen!!  He gives a passionate performance particularly with his eyes & body language.Although many people have pointed out that the movie strays from historical accuracy, it is still a beautiful story about a wise leader who bucks tradition and chooses compassion over bloodshed, openness and acceptance over intolerance.  It is also a wonderful love story. Besides, this follows the Hollywood tradition: How accurate was Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra""?The only reason I didn't give this 5-stars is the singing.

But he is no Gandhi. Now, about this movie.. But as entertainment goes, this is one hellava movie. At the beginning, it may look like a war movie, but the wars and battles and court intrigues are only a backdrop for the romance between Akbar the young Sufi Emperor and Jodha, the independent and proud Hindu Rajput Princess who had to marry him for political reasons. She is a very independent and religious (Hindu) and stands her ground on her faith. He although in position of power, respects her and initially he seems  amused at her  and then slowly falls in love with her. It's a nice romantic journey.My suggestion is to get the Blue Ray version of this movie. Don't spoil it by watching it online on net flicks or worse, you tube.

1145258,A1RJUXDK64O91A,B001450KCS,"Sandy P ""saprater""","[7, 8]","When I saw my first Bollywood film, it took a while to figure out what in the heck was going on. The film itself wasn't labeled a musical, and my previous exposure to films centered in or around India were limited to Gandhi and Monsoon Wedding...neither of which is shot in a true Bollywood style. After getting past my initial wtf, I've learned to enjoy these (mostly) cheerful excursions of song and dance, but I do admit that they have a habit of momentarily taking me out of the plot of the story. Sometimes it's just so vastly different from the emotional or physical pacing of the film, or the musical number begins to incorporate themes (fountains, springs, birds, etc...) that just materialize from seemingly nowhere. And yes, I now know that the Bollywood genre uses these images as a ""substitute"" or symbol of attraction, etc...but that doesn't change the fact that while I enjoy them, they can be distracting and break the film up a bit. That's just this Westerner's experience.HOWEVER...I got very little of that in Jodhaa. The song routines fit each scene. The dancing was incorporated into the plot. And the songs themselves...OMG...hauntingly beautiful and in a style that fit the period of the piece. Needless to say, I bought the soundtrack too. The film isn't as far from Bollywood as Monsoon Wedding, but it uses the musical numbers as an enrichment tool without taking the audience out of the film. There's some lip synching, but usually in tender moments, not throughout the entire number, and with purpose: the song lyrics (thank goodness for subtitles) emote what the speaker is feeling without having him/her turn into ""the Indian version of MC Hammer."" ;) Btw, that last bit wasn't an insult to the genre but the use of one of my favorite quotes from Bride and Prejudice.In fact, the only parts of sound that didn't like were what I called the Dramatic Chipmonk moments. Anyone who is a YouTube fan should know to what I refer. That overly dramatic musical score consisting of barely a few notes and coupled with a piercing glare...usually from Akbar. Oiy! The cheese was running a bit high for me in those moments, and it seemed like they did it ALL the time. LOLOverall, I thought it was an excellent movie. The costumes, the love story, the humorous moments that reminded me of the wonderful, innocent love-play between two characters from films like It Happened One Night. And the chemistry between the two leads was just sizzling! What wonderful actors. Both have such a fantastic way of expressing with their looks and actions. I still smile whenever I think about the scene in which Akbar finds himself embarrassed to be staring at his wife or Jodhaa's look of fascination/lust tinged with embarrassment when she spies her husband working on his swordsmanship. Whew! That scene alone is worth the purchase price. ;-)I really don't think this film fits perfectly into the Bollywood ideal. It branches out with a more subtle mix of what makes Bollywood so fun and glamorous but with more (dare I say) relevance to its musical numbers which i think could really make it appeal to a Western audience. While there may currently be more Indian fans than not, if this film is the example of the new face of Bollywood, I see it truly expanding to encompass a more global audience.But while the quality of the film was superb, I had to subtract one star for the actual dvd format. It's most annoying feature is that you cannot access the main menu until the opening scenes/commercials for the dvd production companies are played. Easily got around by simply popping the disc in and doing an errand or so until it runs its course, but what's really aggrevating is that it's on all the disks...including the second part of the story. A really bad choice on their part. The portion after intermission should jump right to the next scene, otherwise it jars the audience out of the flow of the film. And since this review is for both the film and the product itself, one star just had to go.",4,Stunning epic that will have you cheering for more,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,4009,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'took', 'while', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'labeled', 'musical', 'previous', 'exposure', 'films', 'centered', 'India', 'were', 'limited', 'Gandhi', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'neither', 'shot', 'true', 'Bollywood', 'style', 'getting', 'past', 'initial', 'wtf', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'enjoy', 'mostly', 'cheerful', 'excursions', 'song', 'dance', 'do', 'admit', 'have', 'habit', 'momentarily', 'taking', 'plot', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'vastly', 'different', 'emotional', 'physical', 'pacing', 'film', 'musical', 'number', 'incorporate', 'themes', 'fountains', 'springs', 'birds', 'etc', 'just', 'materialize', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'yes', 'now', 'know', 'Bollywood', 'genre', 'images', 'substitute', 'symbol', 'attraction', 'etc', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'enjoy', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'break', 'film', 'up', 'bit', 'just', 'Westerner', 'experience.HOWEVER', 'got', 'very', 'little', 'Jodhaa', 'song', 'routines', 'fit', 'scene', 'dancing', 'was', 'incorporated', 'plot', 'songs', 'OMG', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'style', 'fit', 'period', 'piece', 'Needless', 'say', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'far', 'Bollywood', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'musical', 'numbers', 'enrichment', 'tool', 'taking', 'audience', 'film', 'lip', 'synching', 'usually', 'tender', 'moments', 'not', 'entire', 'number', 'purpose', 'song', 'lyrics', 'thank', 'goodness', 'subtitles', 'emote', 'what', 'speaker', 'feeling', 'having', 'turn', 'Indian', 'version', 'MC', 'Hammer', 'Btw', 'last', 'bit', 'was', ""n't"", 'insult', 'genre', 'use', 'one', 'favorite', 'quotes', 'Bride', 'Prejudice.In', 'fact', 'only', 'parts', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'were', 'what', 'called', 'Dramatic', 'Chipmonk', 'moments', 'Anyone', 'who', 'YouTube', 'fan', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'refer', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'score', 'consisting', 'barely', 'few', 'notes', 'coupled', 'piercing', 'glare', 'usually', 'Akbar', 'Oiy', 'cheese', 'was', 'running', 'bit', 'high', 'moments', 'seemed', 'did', 'time', 'LOLOverall', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'costumes', 'love', 'story', 'humorous', 'moments', 'reminded', 'wonderful', 'innocent', 'love-play', 'two', 'characters', 'films', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'was', 'just', 'sizzling', 'What', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'have', 'fantastic', 'way', 'expressing', 'looks', 'actions', 'still', 'smile', 'whenever', 'think', 'scene', 'Akbar', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'staring', 'wife', 'Jodhaa', 'look', 'fascination/lust', 'tinged', 'embarrassment', 'when', 'husband', 'working', 'swordsmanship', 'Whew', 'scene', 'alone', 'purchase', 'price', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'perfectly', 'Bollywood', 'ideal', 'out', 'more', 'subtle', 'mix', 'what', 'Bollywood', 'so', 'fun', 'glamorous', 'more', 'dare', 'say', 'relevance', 'musical', 'numbers', 'i', 'think', 'could', 'really', 'make', 'appeal', 'Western', 'audience', 'may', 'currently', 'be', 'more', 'Indian', 'fans', 'not', 'film', 'example', 'new', 'face', 'Bollywood', 'see', 'truly', 'expanding', 'encompass', 'more', 'global', 'audience.But', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'superb', 'had', 'subtract', 'one', 'star', 'actual', 'dvd', 'format', 'most', 'annoying', 'feature', 'can', 'not', 'access', 'main', 'menu', 'opening', 'scenes/commercials', 'dvd', 'production', 'companies', 'are', 'played', 'Easily', 'got', 'simply', 'popping', 'disc', 'doing', 'errand', 'so', 'course', 'what', 'really', 'aggrevating', 'disks', 'including', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'really', 'bad', 'choice', 'part', 'portion', 'intermission', 'should', 'jump', 'right', 'next', 'scene', 'otherwise', 'audience', 'flow', 'film', 'review', 'film', 'product', 'one', 'star', 'just', 'had', 'go']",Jodhaa Akbar

I found part of its appeal in that they didn't dwell on the fighting that was going on during that period. They showed some and enough to show the Emperor's good judgment as far as dealing with his subjects and especially those he had conquered. It was refreshing to see his religious tolerance and respect for his new wife.  The fact that he abided with her wishes concerning her faith made his views far before his time. I know there were inaccuracies as far as historically but it was not a documentary.I was awestruck watching this movie.  The acting was outstanding on the level of Best Actor for Roshon. As a lay person I would not notice technical things but the overall scope of the film. It was lavish and gave a good idea of what life was like in that time and place as far as the cultural differences and the political intrigue. I have nothing but raves for this movie and any criticism for it would be by someone who would never appreciate a movie of this type in the first place.,5,A beautiful love story,1225497600,"11 1, 2008",2008,1109,"['watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'am', 'still', 'telling', 'people', 'charm', 'movie', ""n't"", 'leave', 'one', 'mind', 'found', 'part', 'appeal', 'did', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'fighting', 'was', 'going', 'period', 'showed', 'enough', 'show', 'Emperor', 'good', 'judgment', 'as', 'far', 'dealing', 'subjects', 'especially', 'had', 'conquered', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'religious', 'tolerance', 'respect', 'new', 'wife', 'fact', 'abided', 'wishes', 'concerning', 'faith', 'made', 'views', 'far', 'time', 'know', 'were', 'inaccuracies', 'as', 'far', 'historically', 'was', 'not', 'documentary.I', 'was', 'awestruck', 'watching', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'outstanding', 'level', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Roshon', 'lay', 'person', 'would', 'not', 'notice', 'technical', 'things', 'overall', 'scope', 'film', 'was', 'lavish', 'gave', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'time', 'place', 'as', 'far', 'cultural', 'differences', 'political', 'intrigue', 'have', 'nothing', 'movie', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'type', 'first', 'place']",Jodhaa Akbar
1145264,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B001450KCS,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[3, 4]","To any customers reading this, MAKE SURE YOU READ THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION! Make sure you buy THIS three-disk set, because it is NOT pirated or illegal! The quality is exceptional and you won't regret it.First things first, FORGET ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT BOLLYWOOD! It no longer applies.There's only one person ultimately responsible for this exquisite experience. Ashutosh Gowariker is one of the greatest filmmakers ever. He's creates images on film that are heartbreakingly beautiful, combines them with master storytelling, and coaxes performances from the cast that defies all expectations. I have a goal to see every film he's made thus far, and the three I've seen I'd recommend to anyone! There isn't a single detail of this film he to chance, and the result is as close to perfection as a human can get. Each frame of the movie is so gorgeous you want them to be oil paintings to hang in your house. More on that when I deal with the special features...This movie caused a huge ruckus when it opened because of historical controversy. Being a history buff, I did some research (yes I'm weird) and while the movie did take some liberties, and leaves many things out, it gets more right than it does wrong! Besides, if it had been 100% accurate and included *everything* it would have been a nine hour movie, and would've gotten a little depressing! Movies are meant to entertain, so keep an open mind. Brushing mundane reality aside, let's focus on the world Ashutosh Gowariker so generously gave us. I can't think of many movies that look and sound as beautiful as this one is. The sets, locations, the costumes, the music, the sounds of the swords clashing, the horses, the elephants, the jewelry!!!! (I'm a girly-girl when it comes to the pretties) the food... Even if you watch this movie on mute, it's an experience, but in the name of anything sacred DON'T DO THAT!The music is transforming! I'm not exaggerating, when I hear the first strains of ""Jashn-E-Bahaara"" anything negative in my life disappears. I'm serious it's the best painkiller I know of. I would dance to  ""Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah"" all day if I could do it. More on that song later... There are two songs that I would call hymns ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" (Islamic) and ""Mann Mohana"" (Hindu) but as I'm neither Hindu nor Muslim, I hope I haven't offended anyone. Regardless of how to classify them the music is exquisite and the lyrics really highlight Akbar's devotion to his faith, and Jodhaa's integrity and devotion to hers. A little fun trivia for you is that,  Haidar Ali (the writer) has a cameo of a Sufi who leads his group in singing ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" after the Islamic wedding ceremony.  For sheer passion and the rapture of *finally* being in the arms of your love, you simply cannot top ""In Lamhon Ke Daaman Mein"" its honeymoon music to the tenth power!Again, check your assumptions about Bollywood song and dance at the door. Here the actors do very little singing, (okay they're dubbed who cares!) Jodhaa sings to pray, and has a verse in the ""honeymoon song"" in which she does a pretty twirl. Jalal has a pretty little verse of poetry he sings in Urdu in the ""honeymoon song"" as for dancing, he also has a pretty twirl in ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" but that's it! Azeem-O-Shaan Shahensha is an epic dance number with one thousand people, that would make Bugsby Berkley go green with envy, but unlike most epic numbers in Bollywood, it does not take the form of a music video! Unlike with his masterpiece ""Swades"" Mr. Gowariker doesn't heed the typical sensibilities for using music to tell the love story; it's a masterstroke keeping everything in proper historical context, and preventing the actors from breaking character.The background score is also beautiful and varied. The only thing that stops it from being the absolute best score I've ever heard is merely a few notes that play whenever some fool gets Jalal angry, I mean come on Mr. Roshan's eyes take care of that entirely on their own!Horses and doves, parrots and bunnies, camels and elephants OH MY! The gang's all here and it's great! Out with the old theater adage ""Never work with children or animals"" without them this movie would feel flat! Whether it's Jodhaa cooing with doves, bunnies, and setting her parrots free, or Jalal riding his white horse into battle, and blowing off the stress of being Shahensha (Emperor) by taming a wild elephant, you will be awed with it all and wonder, ""How in the world did they keep it all under control?""A caution to parents... Dear responsible, loving parents, Most of the elephants in this movie are used during battle scenes, and a few crush some soldiers even stepping on their heads. Now, I personally believe that most kids over the age of five see worse on most previews and commercials here in the USA, but I strongly urge you to view the scenes first before sitting down with the munchkins. When my nephews visit, I skip them entirely. Your's Respectfully Warpgirl.The costume designer Neeta Lulla and jewelers Tanishq turn everyone into people who inhabit a time and a place of lost grandeur. Okay, you might have seen Ms. Rai-Bachchan with a similar look in some of her big period films but I doubt it. I'll let you know when I see them for myself. I am certain you've *never* seen Mr. Roshan draped in silk, and brocade dripping with diamonds, pearls, rubies and emeralds! They used the real deal here! Two kilograms for his gold and ruby sword alone! In case you're wondering he's pulls it off effortlessly. If this movie had been submitted for Oscar consideration it would have won a boatload, but Costumes would be a definite lock! Special kudos to the makeup department, just flawless. I find makeup to be a bit iffy with Bollywood.Now, performances! I did warn you this would be long... I watched the movie the first time for Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan so it's only fair I start with her. It boggles my mind that I've read in so many places where people say she can't act! If she can't act, then I must have the wrong idea of what acting is. She uses every part of herself in a role: her voice, the way she walks, the way she eats, heck even the way she sits! Jodhaa is my favorite because she's a lady in her thirties and she's playing a young woman barely twenty and not only does she pull it off, she looks twenty! I don't mean her beautiful face, I mean in her eyes and expression there's innocence and wonder that makes that time of life so special. There are no famous Bollywood histrionics in this movie. Subtle is the name of the game and you must keep most of your focus on the eyes. I recommend the first time you watch this, you read the subtitles, then watch it again and forget them! The biggest emotional impact comes from the characters eyes. Now you'll notice quickly that Ms. Rai-Bachchan is wearing brown contacts for authenticity, but it's a credit to her skill and talent that her emotions shine through like gleaming flames.Jodhaa is a woman of integrity, it's her defining trait. She treats others with kindness and deep respect, but never backs down about what she believes is right. Even when other people wrong her, she doesn't berate them, or try to get even. She holds herself to high standards with grace and dignity. My favorite scene that *always* makes me cry, (my mom was torments me about it) is when she says Jalal's full name for the first time. Perfection! Nevertheless, probably her most technically brilliant scene is the ""wedding night"" scene. It's jaw dropping!I had no idea who Hrithik Roshan was, now I can't believe it took me over two decades to discover him! For anyone who finds his ""hunky-grin"" tiring, or thinks of him as ""the dance guy"" *forget it* just forget it all. There's no grinning at all, and I didn't even know the man could dance until Dhoom2! Are there tears? Yes. However, not the typical Bollywood tears made so famous in frothy romances, or melodramas. Like with Jodhaa, subtlety is the key to Mr. Roshan's portrayal of, Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar.Again he's a man in his thirties playing a young man just turning twenty and he makes it work even though his body is like no twenty year old I've ever seen. He infuses Jalal with idealism, innocence, and the deep venerability of a boy struggling not only to become a man, but also to break free from expectations of the people surrounding him and become a true leader. It's an incredibly complex performance, with layer after layer of technique and emotion.As written, Akbar is very close to being untouchable. He's so good, so pure, intelligent, compassionate, the bravest, ect. Quite honestly, if Mr. Roshan hadn't kept him solidly on the ground, I'd think the movie is about an angel not a man. ""Akbar's angry tune"" aside, Mr. Roshan adds a hair trigger temper, and a talent for holding a grudge that keeps him refreshingly human. Every scene he does is incredible but the ones that show that he's more than just the ""dancing hunk"" are: first, ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" no dialogue, just the expression of how deeply he reveres his God, and the conviction of his faith. Then, ""the wedding night"" rarely are two actors so in-tune with each other. After that, ""the mother scene"" if your heart doesn't twinge, see a doctor. All men should watch ""the groveling scene"" that's how you do it! ""The patriotic scene"" shows the moment when Jalal takes complete control of his empire and his life and Roshan is statesman and Alpha Male at the same time. However, the crown jewel is the ""do you love me"" scene. It's all in the eyes.Both actors are brilliant in their own rights, but neither one would have given such amazing performances without the other. Every-so-often, two actors will be put in a film and something happens. The camera becomes a window and suddenly you're not watching a movie anymore. You become a peeping Tom watching two people go through a finite space in time living and everything that comes with their lives. Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai-Bachchan have done three films together, (this is the second) and all of them are completely different, but in every one, you become a voyeur. They don't play roles with each other, they *become* them. I know I sound insane, I feel silly writing it! Just do me a favor watch, ""the sword scene"" and when *the moment* comes, (you'll know it when it happens) try not to gasp when you see the love flowing between them.NO, I am NOT saying I think they had an affair! I'm saying, that they're that good! I keep hoping to read they've signed on for a dance extravaganza. It can happen!Not to be outdone is the fabulous supporting cast! Two women dominate this playing field of massively talented people! First up the only fully fleshed ""villain"" in the story, (more on the bad guys in a minute)... Ila Arun plays the astute Maham Anga. Talk about every young bride's worst nightmare, the possessive Mother Figure! You see Maham Anga was one of Jalal's father's concubines, and  when Jalal's mother went with her husband while they were in exile, they left their son in her care. Later on after Jalal becomes Emperor, mom goes throughout the empire helping while ""Elder Mother"" still looks after him. Now, she's basically in charge of the entire royal court and the only person Jalal will never contradict.To say she doesn't like the incredibly beautiful Hindu bride Jalal has picked out is an understatement. The minute I saw her on screen I cried out, ""OMG it's the Indian Mrs. Danvers!"" I suppose that means nothing to people who haven't seen or read Rebecca... Google it, if you want. To summarize, Maham Anga is extremely jealous and hates Jodhaa with a passion that boarders on the crazy. Of course, it culminates into something terrible, but it also provides two of the most romantic moments in the movie. If her own machinations aren't bad enough, she has a biological son who causes Jalal misery, so she does double-duty as a villain in this film.The other amazing woman in this movie is Mrs. Poonam Sinha, who plays Jalal's biological mother Empress Hamida Banu Begum. This is the mother-in-law every bride prays for! Supportive, sweet, a helping hand in a new family, and in Jodhaa's case a new world. She wants her boy happy and can see immediately Jodhaa is exactly what he needs. It's astounding how Mrs. Sinha balances the emotions of her character. She *knows* her son considers another woman to be his ""mother"" yet instead of being bitter about it, she does what she can to help him rule and make sure someone is taking care of Jodhaa when he's busy. Of course, ""the mother scene"" just makes everything better. There is one weird thing, she talks to Jodhaa a lot, but Jodhaa never says a word! I guess her eyes talk for her.Now bad guys and idiots... I'll be honest, the villainy is not the sharpest of swords in the armory. In a movie with so much going on you end up not caring that they're flat. First up, the spawn of Anga. Adham Khan the jealous, sadistic, amoral, older half-brother. Every family has a bad seed. Adham is an angry guy. First his dad doesn't choose him as a successor, then his mom is obsessed with the runt (the guy is taller than most people) who got it. Personally, I think if his mother had hugged him more he might not have become a traitorous, raping, thief! Don't worry parents, there is no rape in this movie. It comes out in a verbal argument. As far as brains go, he's definitely the stupidest one! Watch and see how stupid!Now, the family problems don't end there. Jalal also has a pretty older sister named Banu, who has a very nasty husband! Alas, Sharifuddin Hussein wants to be Shahensha too! He does have more brains than Adham, but that's no real achievement. For the most part, he plots in secret and tries to avoid getting his hands dirty until the very end. The person I feel sorry for is Banu, she actually loves the jerk! Don't ask me why, he makes it clear he doesn't return the sentiment. He gets lots of help from other idiots, the head Religious Leader of the Mughal court. This guy hates Jalal's tolerance of things not strictly Islam and the tax reform that hurts his wallet.The other idiot helper is Raj Sujamal Jodhaa's brother, not really a bad guy in the evil sense, but a true moron! Sujamal is a major player in the movie. He's Jodhaa's first cousin, but they were raised as siblings. She calls him Bhaisab, (older brother) he has her rahki it's all very familial, no romantic subtext at all. The problem lies in politics. Jodhaa's dad inherited the throne from his brother Sujamal's father. Now he hopes his uncle gives him a fair share when the kingdom is divided up on his death. You'll have to watch the movie but let me put it this way, he was stupid to trust Sharifuddin.The actor who plays Sujamal is Sonu Sood. Apparently, he's a rising star in Bollywood, but he does very little here but mope, whine, and throw temper tantrums. Out of all the negative characters, he's the weak link because he's just so wishy-washy. Who knows, maybe that's the point. His final scene was very touching.There is ONE tiny flaw in this movie it drives me stark raving bonkers! In the wedding scenes, Jodhaa is decked out in her bridal finery. She's wearing amazing jewelry with a large tikka that lays flat on her forehead during the ceremony, but somehow during ""Khwaja Mere Khwaja"" it changes to a ""bell"" shaped tikka that rests on top of her hairline!Now Special Features! On the third disk of this set, you get... Deleted scenes with subtitles! YEY! Hindi lessons courtesy of the sing-along with the songs feature. Lots of movie trailers that hint of other deleted goodies that didn't get put in, (darn!) again with subtitles. An interview with Gowariker addressing the controversy on Historical Accuracy. There's a  little commentary involving all the heavy hitters in the movie. All in English! Mr. Roshan's accent is swoon-worthy. (Okay yes I need a 12-step program or something!) Fair warning, something went wrong with the sound during Mrs. Gowariker's (also a producer) interview. It isn't the DVD itself so don't worry. It sounds like a microphone blew out. Everyone else is as clear as a bell.Oh remember how I said you'll want to take the images on screen and hang them up? You can! A beautiful set of large postcards also come with the DVD's. Some of the most breataking images are there for pretty pictures! I thought about using them for there intended purpose but they're just too pretty!Enjoy this beautiful movie! It's a true treasure.",5,Hail The Emperor And Empress Of Bollywood!,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,16500,"['customers', 'reading', 'MAKE', 'SURE', 'YOU', 'READ', 'THE', 'PRODUCT', 'DESCRIPTION',

1145265,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001450KCS,Z Hayes,"[10, 10]","There have been many comments about the lackluster quality of the DVD, and so my review shall focus on the movie itself [with the hope that all the flaws of the DVD shall be addressed in  future DVD releases of this amazing movie].The film ""Jodhaa Akbar"" is an ambitious project even by Bollywood standards, for historical and period movies are quite hard to pull off and draw the masses. However, ""Jodhaa Akbar"" is one of the rare exceptions - even at more than 3 hrs in length, the story unfolds in such a manner as to draw in and engage the viewer's attention, with most of the movie focusing on the evolving relationship between Emperor Akbar and his consort Jodhaa Bai. The storyline is based on a little known story in history, that of Muslim Akbar's marriage and relationship with the Hindu-born Princess Jodhaa. The time period is sometime in the 16th century, where Emperor Akbar [Hrithik Roshan] marries a Hindu Rajput princess, Jodhaa [Aishwarya Rai]in order to cement an alliance between the Muslim Mughals and the Hindus. As the daughter of King Bharmal of Amer [Kulbushan Kharbanda], the strong-willed Jodhaa refuses to go meekly to her fate, and demands that Akbar agree to two wishes before agreeing to the marriage, one that she be allowed to keep her Hindu religion and not be forced to convert [in Islam, marriage between a Muslim and non-Muslim requires the non-Muslim to convert in order for the marriage to be considered legal], and second, that she be allowed to erect a shrine in her quarters dedicated to Lord Krishna. Akbar agrees, but is later frustrated when his attempts at intimacy are rebuffed by Jodhaa, who wishes for more time to get to know her new husband.Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai credibly portray the royal couple who try to adapt to each other's customs and give and take, even though it is Jodhaa who is most put upon, considering she has to leave her family and friends behind for a strange new life in a Mughal palace, and where she is welcomed by new friends [Akbar's birth mother] and rebuffed by foes [Akbar's wet nurse and Minister in his goverment, a bitter old woman who is very antagonistic towards Jodhaa]. Akbar, as portrayed by Hrithik Roshan, comes across as a visionary leader before his time, who sets an admirable example by marriage, in order to bridge the chasm between the Muslims and Hindus in India. His style of governance is firm, yet incredibly tolerant, and he deals with his opponents in a fair and just manner.Aishwarya Rai's Jodhaa is luminously beautiful [and honestly, I can't imagine any other contemporary Bollywood actress portraying this role]. She comes across as fiery and gentle, a contradiction of sorts, yet her facial expressions and mannerisms effectively portray the thawing in her feelings towards her powerful and equally determined spouse. What starts off as a purely political alliance and marriage of convenience slowly evolves into a true marriage based upon love, tolerance and compromise. One of the most powerful scenes in this movie [and there are many such dramatic scenes that pack an emotional punch] is the sword duel between a thinly-disguised Jodhaa and Akbar. Their chemistry is so palpable that one ceases to remember that these are two actors playing roles in a movie.Besides the credible acting by the two leads, there are many other strengths in this movie, most notably the beautiful cinematography and the stirring music [unlike many Bollywood productions, the songs here do not interfere with the plot]. One of my favorite song sequences in this movie is the one that has the Sufi master singing praises, complemented by a Sufi dance performance. Akbar joins in, portraying his own spiritual release and this comes across so beautifully in showing the deeply spiritual aspect of Akbar's character.The gorgeous costumes and jewelry are additional eye candy, as are the beautiful and authentic looking sets. All in all, ""Jodhaa Akbar"" delivers all that one could expect from a historical period drama - the casting is excellent, and the direction assured. Highly recommended!",5,"Review of the movie, a cinematic triumph",1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,4086,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'comments', 'lackluster', 'quality', 'DVD', 'so', 'review', 'shall', 'focus', 'movie', 'hope', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'shall', 'be', 'addressed', 'future', 'DVD', 'releases', 'amazing', 'movie', '.The', 'film', 'Jodhaa', 'Akbar', 'ambitious', 'project', 'even', 'Bollywood', 'standards', 'historical', 'period', 'movies', 'are', 'quite', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'draw', 'masses', 'However', 'Jodhaa', 'Akbar', 'one', 'rare', 'exceptions', 'even', 'more', '3', 'hrs', 'length', 'story', 'unfolds', 'such', 'manner', 'draw', 'engage', 'viewer', 'attention', 'most', 'movie', 'focusing', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'Emperor', 'Akbar', 'consort', 'Jodhaa', 'Bai', 'storyline', 'based', 'little', 'known', 'story', 'history', 'Muslim', 'Akbar', 'marriage', 'relationship', 'Hindu-born', 'Princess', 'Jodhaa', 'time', 'period', 'sometime', '16th', 'century', 'where', 'Emperor', 'Akbar', '[', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', ']', 'Hindu', 'Rajput', 'princess', 'Jodhaa', '[', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', ']', 'order', 'cement', 'alliance', 'Muslim', 'Mughals', 'Hindus', 'daughter', 'King', 'Bharmal', 'Amer', '[', 'Kulbushan', 'Kharbanda', ']', 'strong-willed', 'Jodhaa', 'go', 'meekly', 'fate', 'Akbar', 'agree', 'two', 'wishes', 'agreeing', 'marriage', 'one', 'be', 'allowed', 'keep', 'Hindu', 'religion', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'convert', '[', 'Islam', 'marriage', 'Muslim', 'non-Muslim', 'non-Muslim', 'convert', 'order', 'marriage', 'be', 'considered', 'legal', ']', 'second', 'be', 'allowed', 'erect', 'shrine', 'quarters', 'dedicated', 'Lord', 'Krishna', 'Akbar', 'later', 'frustrated', 'when', 'attempts', 'intimacy', 'are', 'rebuffed', 'Jodhaa', 'who', 'more', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'new', 'husband.Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'credibly', 'portray', 'royal', 'couple', 'who', 'try', 'adapt', 'other', 'customs', 'give', 'take', 'even', 'Jodhaa', 'who', 'most', 'put', 'upon', 'considering', 'leave', 'family', 'friends', 'strange', 'new', 'life', 'Mughal', 'palace', 'where', 'welcomed', 'new', 'friends', '[', 'Akbar', 'birth', 'mother', ']', 'rebuffed', 'foes', '[', 'Akbar', 'wet', 'nurse', 'Minister', 'goverment', 'bitter', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'very', 'antagonistic', 'towards', 'Jodhaa', ']', 'Akbar', 'portrayed', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'across', 'visionary', 'leader', 'time', 'who', 'admirable', 'example', 'marriage', 'order', 'bridge', 'chasm', 'Muslims', 'Hindus', 'India', 'style', 'governance', 'firm', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'tolerant', 'opponents', 'fair', 'just', 'manner.Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'Jodhaa', 'luminously', 'beautiful', '[', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'other', 'contemporary', 'Bollywood', 'actress', 'portraying', 'role', ']', 'fiery', 'gentle', 'contradiction', 'sorts', 'yet', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'effectively', 'portray', 'thawing', 'feelings', 'powerful', 'equally', 'determined', 'spouse', 'What', 'off', 'purely', 'political', 'alliance', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'slowly', 'true', 'marriage', 'based', 'love', 'tolerance', 'compromise', 'One', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'movie', '[', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'pack', 'emotional', 'punch', ']', 'sword', 'duel', 'thinly-disguised', 'Jodhaa', 'Akbar', 'chemistry', 'so', 'palpable', 'one', 'remember', 'are', 'two', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'movie.Besides', 'credible', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'strengths', 'movie', 'most', 'notably', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'stirring', 'music', '[', 'many', 'Bollywood', 'productions', 'songs', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'interfere', 'plot', ']', 'One', 'favorite', 'song', 'sequences', 'movie', 'one', 'Sufi', 'master', 'singing', 'praises', 'complemented', 'Sufi', 'dance', 'performance', 'Akbar', 'portraying', 'own', 'spiritual', 'release', 'so', 'beautifully', 'showing', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'aspect', 'Akbar', 'character.The', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'jewelry', 'are', 'additional', 'eye', 'candy', 'are', 'beautiful', 'authentic', 'looking', 'sets', 'Jodhaa', 'Akbar', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'historical', 'period', 'drama', 'casting', 'excellent', 'direction', 'assured', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Jodhaa Akbar
