Matthew Broderick really annoys me, the only movie he can act in is Ferris Bueller's Day Off, all his other films that he has acted in are hideous and crummy, give this guy some acting lessons. I love Nicole Kidman but lately she has picked some lousy choices (The Interperter, Dogville, Bewitched), what the heck is her problem, rent The Others and The Human Stain instead. They should've just stuck to the regular premise of the original film, a comedy version was all wrong.

848064,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002W4UDE,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 5]","What a sad, sad film.  The Stepford Wives only proves that big stars and a big name director like Frank Oz do not always make good pictures.  There was nothing worth saving from this movie.  From the opening scenes to the final credits, and all that I found lying in-between was pure gibberish.  It is annoying to find a film with such decent actors to be so horribly bad.  Kidman has been working very hard lately to make a name for herself in the Hollywood community that a film like this could debunk her.  From the story, to the poorly mismatched characters, to the cheap CGI, this film smelled of recycled garbage from the opening.  It should have been returned, but instead I forged ahead and watched.As bad as this film was, there was a glimmer of light at the beginning.  Kidman's character is somewhat humorous as the television executive with ideas on how to make women more powerful on screen.  What she shows her shareholders are tiny morsels of comedy, but those are quickly eaten nothing is left behind except for crumbs.  From the moment that she leaves the podium, her role is over.  Kidman tries to capture the essence of her character, but just cannot.  I have trouble-seeing Kidman as a comic actress, especially when she has mastered the drama/thriller/musical genre so well.  The lack of comfortability with her character is ultimately what flaws Kidman's performance from the start.  You just never see her excitement or comfort level in her eyes.  You never saw her true character.  This goes the same with everyone else in this film.  Broderick was the worst decision as her husband.  They had no chemistry, no love, and no passion.  I saw them as two actors with lines instead of a secure relationship.  Couple this with more horrible performances by Midler (who never quite reaches the high of her character), Glenn Close (who seemed like she was over-the-top with her character and just finally happy to be in a film with some big name stars), Lovitz (what was he doing in this movie?), and even the always loveable Walken (who seemed stale and sterile throughout the entire film) just flopped.  The actors and their inability to carry this film to a higher level was only half the issue with this film, the other problem lied in the hands of director Frank Oz.What was he thinking in this film?  It felt like his children got into the editing room and spilled glue on the cut film and that was the way he edited it.  There was no continuity at all.  We would jump from one location to the next and then further again without any warning or care.  This creates a sense of distraction and unease in the tone of the film.  Secondly, did Oz know what this film was about?  At one point I thought that these women were robots, and the next they are humans with computer chips in their minds.  What about the sparks?  What about the ATM?  This never seemed to fit at all.  It was as if Oz had made two films and spliced the beginning of one and the end of the other together.First time filmmakers could have done a better job than Frank Oz on this film.  I needed this to be a very dark comedy (if even a comedy at all).  Where was the darkness in this film?  I will tell you ... THERE WASN'T ANY!  If there was anything at all in this film, I would give credit, but there has been nothing redeemable about this film at all.  The choppy direction that Oz perfects jumbles the themes and tones to nearly nothing.  I could not honestly sit here and tell you what the tone of the film was.  I think it was locked somewhere in Oz's mind, and it couldn't get out.  This goes the same with the theme of the film.  Does it have something to do with perfection or feminism?  A happy home or being wealthy?  Maybe it has to do with cooking cup cakes over pies?  How about playing God in suburbia?  Who knows?  I couldn't tell, and I am definitely not willing to watch it again to find out.Overall, this was the worst film that I have seen this year by far.  The ending was laughable and just plain stupid, as you could probably say the same for the rest of the film.  All the actors did the worst jobs they could and it became increasingly obvious that Oz should just go back to doing Muppet voices.  There is nothing of value in this movie and if you chose to spend the money to see it than at least you have been warned.  This is yet another perfect example of a Hollywood blunder.

It was a pretty funny movie, oddly enough, since the original had more of a horror movie feel to it. Not overly witty comedy, but there were parts that deserved at least a chuckle. But there were also some things that would make you sigh with disbelief, because it was that stupid. Take the robotic pet dog for example. In the original, I don't think they had a freakin' pet at all, nonetheless, a mechanic one. The plot of the two movies are similar, but they are by far totally different also. The original was more of a horror movie approach at the look of how women were viewed in society. You know what I mean. You have the main character who is all 'Feminism girl power' who ends up in the town of Stepford and finds out all the women are being replaced with robots to be the perfect housewives. The original made a statement, whether you cared or not. The remake here, on the other hand, had no statement. It was just about a spoiled fairly well off woman who loses her job so her and her family move to the suburbs in the seemingly perfect town of Stepford. A similarity is the women in the town are perfect in every way. But in the first, the women were replaced with robots. In the remake, they simply have chips embedded into their brains. Now, the bad part of the movie is the end. When the main character, played by Nicole Kidman, finds out the secret of the Men's Association, she's standing in a whole room full of men, including her husband, while she's trapped, waiting for him to decide whether he wants to switch her to a perfect wife or not. Of course the movie ends with the two tricking the rest of the members of the Men's Association, and her husband confessing that he didn't change her, because he couldn't go through with it. Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick give each other a loving look as she tells him that what he did made him a real man. The first thought that crossed my mind was, 'Nevermind the fact that he was contemplating replacing you to begin with.' I won't reveal the actual bad guy of the movie, but it's not who you think, and when you find out who it is, you'll find the ending just as dumb as I did.",2,Can you call it a remake?,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,2299,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoiled', 'movie', 'maybe', 'should', 'stop', 'reading', 'review', 'now', 'own', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'oddly', 'enough', 'original', 'had', 'more', 'horror', 'movie', 'feel', 'Not', 'overly', 'witty', 'comedy', 'were', 'parts', 'deserved', 'least', 'chuckle', 'were', 'also', 'things', 'would', 'make', 'sigh', 'disbelief', 'was', 'stupid', 'Take', 'robotic', 'pet', 'dog', 'example', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'freakin', 'pet', 'nonetheless', 'mechanic', 'one', 'plot', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'similar', 'are', 'far', 'totally', 'different', 'also', 'original', 'was', 'more', 'horror', 'movie', 'approach', 'look', 'how', 'women', 'were', 'viewed', 'society', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'who', ""'Feminism"", 'girl', 'power', 'who', 'up', 'town', 'Stepford', 'out', 'women', 'are', 'being', 'replaced', 'robots', 'be', 'perfect', 'housewives', 'original', 'made', 'statement', 'cared', 'not', 'remake', 'here', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'statement', 'was', 'just', 'spoiled', 'fairly', 'well', 'woman', 'who', 'job', 'family', 'move', 'suburbs', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'town', 'Stepford', 'similarity', 'women', 'town', 'are', 'perfect', 'way', 'first', 'women', 'were', 'replaced', 'robots', 'remake', 'simply', 'have', 'chips', 'embedded', 'brains', 'Now', 'bad', 'part', 'movie', 'end', 'When', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'out', 'secret', 'Men', 'Association', 'standing', 'whole', 'room', 'full', 'men', 'including', 'husband', 'trapped', 'waiting', 'decide', 'switch', 'perfect', 'wife', 'not', 'course', 'movie', 'two', 'tricking', 'rest', 'members', 'Men', 'Association', 'husband', 'confessing', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'give', 'other', 'loving', 'look', 'what', 'did', 'made', 'real', 'man', 'first', 'thought', 'crossed', 'mind', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'contemplating', 'replacing', 'begin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'actual', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'not', 'who', 'think', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'who', ""'ll"", 'find', 'ending', 'just', 'as', 'dumb', 'did']",N/A

Nicole Kidman does a good job as a recently fired head of a TV network who spirals into depression and decides to move to a suburbian haven for housewives, partly to save her failing marriage to Matthew Broderick, who works under her. It turns out that Stepford is the perfect home for married men, as theirs wives do anything and everything to please them and not give them any trouble, due to being reprogrammed. The premise is good and speaks about societal values and culture, but the execution of it all is poorly done by director Frank Oz, and what you are left with is a film that entertains, but doesn't come anywhere near being a good film. The performances by Kidman, Midler, Walken, Close and Roger Bart are done well, although Broderick seems too wooden, even for this part.

I was a little surprised when I read that the ""remake"" of Stepford was going to have comedic elements but I never imagined it would be a full fledged comedy.I guess when you think about it, the premise always had comic potential I just never imagined anyone would ever really do it that way.I liked Matthew Broderick and I never miss the opportunity to see a Nicole Kidman movie. Plus with Christopher Walken, what more can you ask for in a black comedy?I saw a touch of confusion in the cuts, well actually a lot of confusion. It seemed like the writer couldn't decide if the wives were robots or humans with implants. If they had implants then how could they have ""features"" like an ATM and the like. If they were implants then what was the naked manniquin of Nicole doing? So were they implanted or were they replaced? Much of what they did made no sense.I guess the diorector figured that out midway into the filming and tried to delete most of the scenes where the wives had robotic features except the scene with Bette Midler. That scene in her kitchen made so sense but it was way too funny to leave out once it was done even though it didn't jell with the rest of the plot.Overall it was enjoyable, but I guess it wasn't really a remake of the ""Stepford Wives"" but a comedy called ""The Stepford Wives"". Comparing it to the original is waste of time since they are two totally different films.There is no reason why you can't enjoy both. I wonder how many of the bad reviews here would not be as bad if the movie had a different name.

Yet another remake is put through the mill here, but somehow you just know that with Frank Oz directing, there is unlikely to be any of the dark or sinister tension of the original movie. If you don't know the story, Kidman and Broderick play not so happy couple who move to the ""burbs"" of Connecticut after her high powered career is pushed off the rails. Broderick enrolls in the ""Mens Club"" and is in awe of all of his new found friends who seem fully content, and have happy smiling wives who bend to their every whim. Stepford seems the ideal community, too ideal in fact, and Kidman and Bette Midler (playing a neurotic author)suspect foul play, and in so doing hopefully pull us (the audience) into a darkly comic mystery? Or not as the case may be as this can only be regarded as a limp comedy at best. This movie has a great cast, and the first 30 minutes or so builds nicely and promises much. Oz directing tries to bring a contemporary slant with some subtle side comment on reality shows, but the reworking of the original script gets quickly bogged down in its own incredulity. Some reviews have been a little too harsh in my opinion, probably due mostly to the inevitability of it all (even if you haven't seen the original) coupled with a completely ridiculous ending that's too silly for words. But despite this there are a few saving graces, particularly from Roger Bart as the overly camp Roger Bannister who aids Midler and Kidman.

848078,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0002W4UDE,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[10, 12]","Ira Levin's cautionary novel, ""The Stepford Wives"", was a fascinating fable of the ultimate male backlash to feminism; in 1975, director Bryan Forbes turned the novel into a chilling variation of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", as innocent wives are substituted by zombie-like robots, their husbands bonding in a smugly evil male cult. Unsettling and ambiguous, the fate of the actual women is left to the viewer's imagination, making it far more frightening than a pat resolution would have been.This concept was apparently lost on Paramount, DreamWorks, and Frank Oz, who wavered between camp and black comedy heavy-handedness, in this 2004 remake. Scripted by Paul Rudnick, the women are no longer normal, sympathetic wives, but high-powered execs, with apparent agendas against men, and husbands little more than doorstops. Their fate, to become blond-haired sex-slave bimbos locked in 'June Cleever' mode, while their idiot spouses adjust their breast sizes by remote control, and swap the wives for favors, demeans both men and women, and even offers an out-of-place jab at homosexuals, as a funny gay spouse is turned into a right-wing religious zealot politician (how an openly gay couple would ever be even allowed in this community is ignored).While spoofing the earlier film isn't, in itself, a bad idea, no one involved in this project apparently had a clear vision of what they were aiming at, so continuity and logic are sadly missing. As other critics have rightly noted, the status of the wives waivers between being robots and being micro-chipped and brainwashed humans, making the Nicole Kidman 'template' body, and finale 'revelation' of community leader Christopher Walken's actual status as ridiculous as an ATM-spewing wife, and remote controls to adjust emotional responses and breast sizes, labeled, conveniently, with each wife's name. All the pretty, golden-hued settings, and Matthew Broderick's emergence as a 'good guy with a heart' who saves the day can't compensate for the quagmire of a plot.The real shame of it all is that the potential for a good film hovers over the proceedings, just out of reach, and some really fine performances are all for naught. Glenn Close gives a strangely sympathetic twist to the film's villain, Walken is the most engaging (and youthful) he's been in years, Bette Midler and Roger Bart are both hilarious, Jon Lovitz is at his silly best, and Nicole Kidman again proves herself more than adept at comedy, and portraying American women. Matthew Broderick seems to be making a career of playing milquetoast males (Ferris Bueller, where are you?), and for 'eye and ear candy', nothing can quite match Country Music sex symbol Faith Hill's orgasmic moans, and cup-size changes.

848080,AMUTYOX234D90,B0002W4UDE,Bill,"[7, 8]","This movie is the height of incompetence, offering little more than minimal entertainment value. And unfortunately, it doesn't fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category, which would at least partially redeem it. It does serve, however, as a perfect example of the creative bankruptcy of today's Hollywood, where concept rules (let's remake ""The Stepford Wives"" as a comedy with Nicole Kidman!) and follow through is an afterthought.The blame has to be put right at the doors of the director, Frank Oz, and the writer, Paul Rudnick. The latter probably deserves most of the credit for this debacle: At his best, he's the king (or queen, in this case) of the one-liner, but no more than that -- character development is beyond his capabilities. At his worst (as in this movie), his one-liners lack wit and fall flat, and there's no real plot holding them together.Pity the poor actors assigned to this disaster. In her initial  scenes, Kidman proves to be a brilliant physical comedian -- in both her facial and body movements, she captures a perfect comic tone. Unfortunately, that doesn't last (the director's fault, I'd say), and she plays the rest of the movie like a serious drama, which doesn't work. Matthew Broderick gives one of his worst performances ever; he seems quite embarrassed to be in this turkey. Bette Midler does her best, but she's totally wasted, as it must be said, she often is in movies.The only one who captures the right tone and squeezes every laugh out of her lines is Glenn Close, who looks amazingly like a younger Cloris Leachman in this movie. She deserves a special Academy Award for bravery. Under loose directors (see Robert Altman's ""Cookie's Fortune"" -- or better yet, don't), she can sometimes go so far over the top as to be unfunny. But she's got her dial turned to just the right level this time. However, it's not nearly enough to save the movie.(SPOILER ALERT) Most insulting to the audience are this movie's wild inconsistencies. For example, we see Kidman and Broderick's kids at the beginning and then they're forgotten after that -- if it weren't for a couple of stray references to them in subsequent scenes, you'd assume this couple was childless. But most astounding of all is how the movie can't even be consistent in its central premise -- that is, what is occurring with the wives. The script can't decide if they're being killed and replaced by robots with special features (several scenes indicate that's the case), or if the women have simply received implants in the brain (as the ending indicates). I understand there were major reshoots done to try to fix this movie, but they seem to have only made things worse.

It's not the greatest film I've ever seen. Nor is it the best film of the year. But what it IS is a highly enjoyable movie that makes you laugh at its predecessor in a not-unkindly-way. The original Stepford Wives was meant to be creepy and a bit campy (You can admit it! It was just a tad bit campy!). This film, in contrast, is made for visual enjoyment and comedic value. And the story isn't THAT far removed from the original's plot.This time, we have a young, powerful couple (played by Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick) who decide to make a life-change by moving to the quiet and tranquil city of Stepford, Conneticut. Everything seems perfect (especially the women!). But Nicole Kidman begins to notice something very odd about the Stepford Wives. They're a bit too...uh...cheery? Contrived? Controlled! Will her husband fall prey to the same ideals that made the other men of Stepford turn their wives into Betty Crocker Zombies?With an ensemble cast (including the outlandish Glen Close, Bette Midler, Faith Hill, and, of course, Christopher Walken), it's hard to say that this was a ""bad"" film. True, actors don't make the movie -- there's much more to film making than that -- but these talented film stars must have read the screenplay before signing on, wouldn't you agree?So WHY did I enjoy it so much? Simple. It made me laugh, and much of the film was pure eye-candy. The colorful dresses, the amazing set decorations, the haunting music accompaniments, and the inarguable fact that the director (Frank Oz) put his actors and actresses into freaky/funny roles (both at the same time) made for a wonderful movie-going spectacle.

But, they are all brilliant films. This film takes the basics of the original and, instead of just pointlessly remaking that film (like doing a cover of a song exactly like the first), throws in its own ideas.To try to make sense of this film using the laws of nature and physics is a pointless act, and completely misses the point the filmmakers intended. Just see the ATM wife, Midler's beer chest, and Faith Hill's square dance flipout as exaggerated examples of ultra-subservience and confrmity.There is camp and parody in this film. It is funny at times, eerie and dark at others. It's funny to see Kidman trying to adapt to her new community before she encounters her own possible ""reprogramming"" (all those muffins). But mostly it's the acting that is very solid here. Kidman, Midler, Close, Lovitz and, of course, Christopher Walken, are all great here. This movie doesn't try to be on a level with the classics.

Both have obnoxious main characters who get away with bad behavior, and by the end of the movie/book, they still have no redeeming qualities and have not learned anything whatsoever. The underlying message becomes 'it's OK to be a brat: to have zero consideration for other folks, to break rules and do your own thing, etc. etc.' I also do not appreciate the harsh tone the movie has towards women in general. By the end of the movie, the message is implied that there is something amiss with women who stay home to keep house, raise children, wear other colors than black, and partake in community activites. Women, of all people, do not need harsh scrutiny. We all come from different backgrounds and upbringings, and women most certainly cannot do it all. I believe women should do whatever makes them happy.  If you enjoy being a Martha Stewart type, there is nothing wrong with that if it makes you happy, and likewise if you want to become an executive. Why be so harsh and condemning? And as any non-city person will tell ya, life out in the sticks needs some type of community/social activities, or else there will be very few opportunities to get together with other folks. We are social beings, after all. We need social interactions with each other. Another peeve I have with the movie is once again, as seems to be the trend lately, a plot twist occurs from out of left field. Hello, foreshadowing. I do not enjoy being manipulated. I like a little heads-up, and not be thrown a 180 degree turn because the writers are stuck. I also think they should have left in the deleted scenes of Bette Midler becoming a human lawn mower. It would still have kept in tune with the rest of the movie, since the rest of the movie is already over the top, and it was the funniest.Watch this movie for the ending, however - it is really funny and the only reason to see the movie.

848086,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,B0002W4UDE,Brian J Hay,"[2, 4]","I'm surprised by the comments made about this film. So few people got the joke. Granted, it's not a great film. It'll never land on any ""Top 100"" lists (at least not the ones that are complimentary anyway) but it's a lot better than what it's being given credit for.The acting in the film is very good. Nicole Kidman plays a stressed-to-the-hilt executive with personality quirks that include workaholism, chronic overachieving and a pathological need for control. Her performance is excellent. With her statuesque good looks she's every underachiever's dream babe (or notion of the perfect Dominatrix-take your pick). Matthew Broderick makes a great foil in the role of her husband. He's entirely convincing as a well and truly henpecked every-man who (finally) finds his ""inner man"". Bette Midler comes up with the type of textbook neurotic character that only she can come up with. Christopher Walken is perfect as a suave (but completely mad) scientist. Glenn Close manages a ""permanent press"" demeanour that could only exist on an automated product. Roger Bart is hilarious as a flamboyant gay man turned subdued Republican. Jon Lovitz isn't really called on to show much depth but he does get some great lines. He delivers them as only he can.There is a problem with the cohesion of the story line. One scene makes it seem as if robots have replaced the women; the physical aspects shown couldn't be managed by anything but a machine. Later situations show the ladies to be human, but changed. Somebody took a right instead of a left and forgot to change the signpost maybe? That scene should have been changed in favour of one that didn't puncture the plot.It's not a big problem though and it's quickly forgotten when watching the film. This version of ""The Stepford Wives"" isn't an imitation of the original film and it doesn't follow the novel literally either. It pokes fun at both and does so with a lot of affection. In the bigger picture it satirizes the fact that people are always trying to change each other. The town of Stepford and the automated shells that end up running around in wives clothing are part of the inevitable result of forcing personal change down a peoples' throats. It's only part of the result though. It's made clear that (at some point) ""the men are next"". The point the film makes is that doing that robs people of their individuality and eventually reduces them to a state where they may as well be robots. The creators took the idea and had some fun with it.The whole film has its tongue so far in its cheek that it's licking its ear from the inside. Everything about it is ""over-the-top"". Characterizations are played to extremes. The programmed-for-perfection wives are so flat they could be paper dolls. The ""real women"" at the other end of the spectrum are so neurotic they belong in rubber rooms. Their mates are such wimps they give new meaning to the term. The town itself represents an ideal that could never exist. It's delightfully absurd and had me laughing because of it.But it's best to watch it with a black jester's cap on.",3,This Shouldn't be Taken So Seriously,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,3081,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'comments', 'made', 'film', 'few', 'people', 'got', 'joke', 'Granted', 'not', 'great', 'film', ""'ll"", 'never', 'land', 'Top', '100', 'lists', 'least', 'not', 'ones', 'are', 'complimentary', 'anyway', 'lot', 'better', 'what', 'being', 'given', 'credit', 'for.The', 'acting', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'stressed-to-the-hilt', 'executive', 'personality', 'quirks', 'include', 'workaholism', 'chronic', 'overachieving', 'pathological', 'need', 'control', 'performance', 'excellent', 'statuesque', 'good', 'underachiever', 'dream', 'babe', 'notion', 'perfect', 'Dominatrix-take', 'pick', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'great', 'foil', 'role', 'husband', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'well', 'truly', 'henpecked', 'every-man', 'who', 'finally', 'inner', 'man', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'up', 'type', 'textbook', 'neurotic', 'character', 'only', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'perfect', 'suave', 'completely', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'permanent', 'press', 'demeanour', 'could', 'only', 'exist', 'automated', 'product', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'hilarious', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'man', 'turned', 'subdued', 'Republican', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', ""n't"", 'really', 'called', 'show', 'much', 'depth', 'get', 'great', 'lines', 'only', 'problem', 'cohesion', 'story', 'line', 'One', 'scene', 'seem', 'robots', 'have', 'replaced', 'women', 'physical', 'aspects', 'shown', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'managed', 'anything', 'machine', 'Later', 'situations', 'show', 'ladies', 'be', 'human', 'changed', 'Somebody', 'took', 'right', 'instead', 'left', 'forgot', 'change', 'signpost', 'maybe', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'favour', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'puncture', 'plot.It', 'not', 'big', 'problem', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'version', 'Stepford', 'Wives', ""n't"", 'imitation', 'original', 'film', ""n't"", 'follow', 'novel', 'literally', 'either', 'fun', 'so', 'lot', 'affection', 'bigger', 'picture', 'fact', 'people', 'are', 'always', 'trying', 'change', 'other', 'town', 'Stepford', 'automated', 'shells', 'end', 'up', 'running', 'around', 'wives', 'clothing', 'are', 'part', 'inevitable', 'result', 'forcing', 'personal', 'change', 'down', 'peoples', 'throats', 'only', 'part', 'result', 'made', 'clear', 'point', 'men', 'are', 'next', 'point', 'film', 'doing', 'robs', 'people', 'individuality', 'eventually', 'state', 'where', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'robots', 'creators', 'took', 'idea', 'had', 'fun', 'it.The', 'whole', 'film', 'tongue', 'so', 'far', 'cheek', 'licking', 'ear', 'inside', 'Everything', 'over-the-top', 'Characterizations', 'are', 'played', 'extremes', 'programmed-for-perfection', 'wives', 'are', 'so', 'flat', 'could', 'be', 'paper', 'dolls', 'real', 'women', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'are', 'so', 'neurotic', 'belong', 'rubber', 'rooms', 'mates', 'are', 'such', 'give', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'town', 'ideal', 'could', 'never', 'exist', 'delightfully', 'absurd', 'had', 'laughing', 'it.But', 'best', 'watch', 'black', 'jester', 'cap']",N/A

Whilst it does pale in comparison to the earlier 1975 Bryan Forbes film (based on the controversial Ira Levin novel), I believe that the remake of STEPFORD WIVES still has the ability to stir debate and argument about the delicate balance of power in married relationships.When hard-driven TV executive Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman in a most unattractive brunette dutch-boy haircut) is fired from her job following the deadly aftermath of one of her television projects, husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) arranges for the family to relocate to the small Connecticut gated community of Stepford.There, Joanna's very principals are undermined as she finds herself in a world of perfect picket fences, Barbie doll-beautiful women and their very ordinary husbands.  When Joanna and Walter finally discover the horrific secret behind Stepford's glossy facade, will it be too late?  THE STEPFORD WIVES, even in this watered-down comedy version, still asks the potent question of how successful is a wife 'allowed' to be until she begins threatening her husband's masculinity.Bette Midler and Roger Bart add the bulk of the comedy with their supporting roles as two more cynical Stepford residents trying to rail against the system; and as always Glenn Close is a scene-stealing marvel as Stepford's resident grande dame (a kooky performance I love to refer to as ""June Cleaver on smack"")!  Nicole Kidman never does comedy especially well but has a charming presence, and Matthew Broderick is always great playing the nerdy nebbish.

848092,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0002W4UDE,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 3]","This remake of The Stepford Wives is pretty pitiful. An exceptional cast (Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken, Bette Midler, and Glenn Close) are wasted in a story that does not make any sense.I thought that the major weakness was the failure of Paul Rudnick to write a coherent storyline with internal consistency. The over the top acting, settings, costumes just did not compensate for the fact that the plot was poorly developed and thus the film is full of inconsistencies. Were the Stepford wives robots or did they have brain implants?  This certainly makes a difference when trying to understand how Bette Midler is able to stick her hand into the flames of a gas burning stove without getting burned.After a film full of inconsistent nonsense, Rudnick tries to pull the entire disjointed mess together again with Glenn Close's final dialogue. Does it work?  Absolutely not!  Her final monologue is full of details and concepts never introduced in the film and just does not tie together the abundance of lose ends that this movie generates.Possibly the most grating aspect of the film was the gay couple.

Usually, I'm a very harsh critic - but I didn't have a problem with Stepford Wives.I think every movie should be evaluated in terms of its agenda.  For example: a wry little comedy like `Bottle Rocket' is not going to measure up to the depth of - oh say - `Raging Bull.'  Yet, both of the aforementioned films are quite successful in doing what they intended to do.With that said - it is important - before you watch Stepford Wives - to have some idea of what this film's agenda is.  It is not a biting satire.  It is not a feminist horror flick.  It is not even *that* intelligent.  Stepford Wives is exactly what I had suspected it to be: a glib comedy that brings a bit of thoughtless pleasure to its audiences.  Several reviewers have lamented the fact that certain elements of the movie do not make sense (for example, why does Nicole Kidman encounter a ""robot"" version of herself, if the wives are not made into robots but - rather - are given brain chips?).  Fair enough.  Ideally, someone should have addressed the film's inconsistencies.  But come on.  This movie isn't enjoyable because of its taught premise.  Personally, I enjoyed Stepford Wives for 2 reasons:1. It is complete Hollywood eye candy.  The colors are gaudy pastel; the sets seem almost plastic; and Nicole Kidman - per usual - is stunning.  It's easy to consume this film visually.2. There are a lot of worthy one-liners (see the ever funny Roger's comment about a giant vat of cobbler vomit).  This is more or less straight-forward, simple-minded comedy - but certainly a few notches above almost any other `hit' film.  This is by no means a perfect movie, or a fabulous comedy.  However, you could definitely do worse.  For those of you who are looking for an entertaining (perhaps even delightful) 90-minute flick that will not necessarily change your life, I encourage you to give Stepford Wives a shot.",4,just a pretty little comedy,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,1955,"['have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'little', 'surprised', 'caustic', 'reviews', 'Usually', ""'m"", 'very', 'harsh', 'critic', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'Stepford', 'Wives.I', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'evaluated', 'terms', 'agenda', 'example', 'wry', 'little', 'comedy', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'not', 'going', 'measure', 'up', 'depth', 'oh', 'say', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Yet', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'successful', 'doing', 'what', 'intended', 'do.With', 'said', 'important', 'watch', 'Stepford', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'agenda', 'not', 'biting', 'satire', 'not', 'feminist', 'horror', 'flick', 'not', 'even', '*that*', 'intelligent', 'Stepford', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'suspected', 'be', 'glib', 'comedy', 'bit', 'thoughtless', 'pleasure', 'audiences', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'lamented', 'fact', 'certain', 'elements', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'example', 'why', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'encounter', 'robot', 'version', 'herself', 'wives', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'robots', 'rather', 'are', 'given', 'brain', 'chips', 'Fair', 'enough', 'Ideally', 'someone', 'should', 'have', 'addressed', 'film', 'inconsistencies', 'come', 'movie', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'taught', 'premise', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'Stepford', 'Wives', '2', 'reasons:1', 'complete', 'Hollywood', 'eye', 'candy', 'colors', 'are', 'gaudy', 'pastel', 'sets', 'seem', 'almost', 'plastic', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'usual', 'stunning', 'easy', 'consume', 'film', 'visually.2', 'are', 'lot', 'worthy', 'one-liners', 'see', 'ever', 'funny', 'Roger', 'comment', 'giant', 'vat', 'cobbler', 'vomit', 'more', 'less', 'straight-forward', 'simple-minded', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'few', 'notches', 'almost', 'other', 'hit', 'film', 'perfect', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'comedy', 'However', 'could', 'definitely', 'do', 'worse', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'perhaps', 'even', 'delightful', '90-minute', 'flick', 'will', 'not', 'necessarily', 'change', 'life', 'encourage', 'give', 'Stepford', 'shot']",N/A

848100,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0002W4UDE,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 2]","The original Stepford Wives was a barbed commentary on the kind of women men wanted, obedient, complacent, and seeing themselves as ranking lower than men.  It was a shot in the arm of the women's lib movement.  Fast forward nearly thirty years later.  The concept here is the same, but this version plays up the comedic side rather than the suspense and horror of the original.  It also shows that men don't have the monopoly on denigrating the opposite sex, given the male-bashing ""Balance of Sex"" and reality TV shows, ""I Could Do Better"" promoted by cutthroat network executive Joanna Eberhardt at the beginning.From there, the story remains the same, how she and her family go to Stepford, Connecticut.  Instantly, the sight of smiling buxom blonde women in nice summer dresses turn her husband Walter's head.  The smart house is in keeping with the high tech age, with even a cute electronic terrier to boot.Joanna isn't exactly chuffed with the brainless women, led by the bubby ever-smiling Claire Wellington.  Their idea of discussing a book for reading is not the latest volume of LBJ's biography, but a book of Christmas holiday ornaments.  She tries to fit in, ditching her darker coloured outfits and dressing up so that the one non-Stepford resembling wife, Bobbie Markowitz, a sardonic feminist author, says she looks like Betty Crocker.  Bobbie's kitchen looks like a tornado has visited, as she's way too busy with her latest book.Her first suspicions that things aren't what they are comes when a woman starts spinning like a top during a square dance, collapses, and emits sparks.  Joanna tries to offer assistance, and advises calling an ambulance, but everyone there is relying on Claire's wife Mike.The one big difference here is the presence of a gay couple, and the more feminine one, Roger, who is upbeat and flamboyant becomes the other person sympathetic to Joanna.  There is a clear separation of sexes, where the men hang out at the Men's Association, playing cards, drinking beer, and having fun with electronic toys.  Walter's a bit bewildered at the sight of the Stepford ATM, but when he comments deadpan ""she gives out singles,"" all the men laugh good-naturedly.Nicole Kidman does competently as Joanna, but she is overshadowed by Bette Midler's Bobbie and Roger Bart's Roger.  Matthew Broderick (Walter) is good, but Glenn Close has seen better days.  Her makeup is pallid, pasty, with that artificial smile, making her another gargoyle-like character (q.v. Cruella de Vil).  And Christopher Walken (Mike) is just retreading the same villain role as before.Who knows what the decision was to cast pop-country singer Faith Hill as Sarah Saunderson, but given her image makeover as a haystack honey beginning with her Faith album, casting her as a Stepford Wife is ideal.  She does have some funny moments but at her expense.  No, she doesn't sing, but if that's her vocals in an offscreen bedroom scene, it shows she's got some kind of talent--some would call it talent.Like Diabolique and Abre Los Ojos, if you've seen the original...  The mystery is essentially the same, except updated for the high tech age, plus the ending is different.  All I'll say is that it ultimately reveals how some kind of give and take is needed between couples so both are able to reach their potentials.  In other words, a woman should not go to the extreme of being a brainless Stepford wife, but also not to the aggressive man-squashing pole either.  And the epithet ""I Could Do Better"" applies to both sexes, but in how both could treat each other with respect so that they are both validated as nice and intelligent human beings.  Yes, both could do better.  As for the movie, directed by Frank Oz (The Dark Crystal, Yoda's puppeteer), he has done all right.",4,Men and women could all do better,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,3779,"['original', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'was', 'barbed', 'commentary', 'kind', 'women', 'men', 'wanted', 'obedient', 'complacent', 'seeing', 'ranking', 'lower', 'men', 'was', 'shot', 'arm', 'women', 'lib', 'movement', 'Fast', 'forward', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'concept', 'here', 'same', 'version', 'up', 'comedic', 'side', 'rather', 'suspense', 'horror', 'original', 'also', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'monopoly', 'denigrating', 'opposite', 'sex', 'given', 'male-bashing', 'Balance', 'Sex', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'Could', 'Do', 'Better', 'promoted', 'cutthroat', 'network', 'executive', 'Joanna', 'Eberhardt', 'beginning.From', 'there', 'story', 'same', 'how', 'family', 'go', 'Stepford', 'Connecticut', 'Instantly', 'sight', 'smiling', 'buxom', 'blonde', 'women', 'nice', 'summer', 'dresses', 'turn', 'husband', 'Walter', 'head', 'smart', 'house', 'keeping', 'high', 'tech', 'age', 'even', 'cute', 'electronic', 'terrier', 'boot.Joanna', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'chuffed', 'brainless', 'women', 'led', 'bubby', 'ever-smiling', 'Claire', 'Wellington', 'idea', 'discussing', 'book', 'reading', 'not', 'latest', 'volume', 'LBJ', 'biography', 'book', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'ornaments', 'fit', 'ditching', 'darker', 'coloured', 'outfits', 'dressing', 'up', 'so', 'one', 'non-Stepford', 'resembling', 'wife', 'Bobbie', 'Markowitz', 'sardonic', 'feminist', 'author', 'Betty', 'Crocker', 'Bobbie', 'kitchen', 'tornado', 'visited', 'way', 'too', 'busy', 'latest', 'book.Her', 'first', 'suspicions', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'are', 'when', 'woman', 'spinning', 'top', 'square', 'dance', 'sparks', 'Joanna', 'offer', 'assistance', 'calling', 'ambulance', 'everyone', 'relying', 'Claire', 'wife', 'Mike.The', 'one', 'big', 'difference', 'here', 'presence', 'gay', 'couple', 'more', 'feminine', 'one', 'Roger', 'who', 'upbeat', 'flamboyant', 'becomes', 'other', 'person', 'sympathetic', 'Joanna', 'clear', 'separation', 'sexes', 'where', 'men', 'hang', 'out', 'Men', 'Association', 'playing', 'cards', 'drinking', 'beer', 'having', 'fun', 'electronic', 'toys', 'Walter', 'bit', 'bewildered', 'sight', 'Stepford', 'ATM', 'when', 'comments', 'deadpan', 'out', 'singles', 'men', 'good-naturedly.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'competently', 'Joanna', 'overshadowed', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Bobbie', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'Roger', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Walter', 'good', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'makeup', 'pallid', 'pasty', 'artificial', 'smile', 'making', 'gargoyle-like', 'character', 'q.v', 'Cruella', 'Vil', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Mike', 'just', 'retreading', 'same', 'villain', 'role', 'before.Who', 'what', 'decision', 'was', 'cast', 'pop-country', 'singer', 'Faith', 'Hill', 'Sarah', 'Saunderson', 'given', 'image', 'makeover', 'haystack', 'honey', 'beginning', 'Faith', 'album', 'casting', 'Stepford', 'Wife', 'ideal', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'expense', 'No', ""n't"", 'sing', 'vocals', 'offscreen', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'got', 'kind', 'talent', 'would', 'call', 'talent.Like', 'Diabolique', 'Abre', 'Los', 'Ojos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'mystery', 'essentially', 'same', 'updated', 'high', 'tech', 'age', 'ending', 'different', ""'ll"", 'say', 'ultimately', 'how', 'kind', 'give', 'take', 'needed', 'couples', 'are', 'able', 'reach', 'potentials', 'other', 'words', 'woman', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'extreme', 'being', 'brainless', 'Stepford', 'wife', 'also', 'not', 'aggressive', 'man-squashing', 'pole', 'epithet', 'Could', 'Do', 'Better', 'applies', 'sexes', 'how', 'could', 'treat', 'other', 'respect', 'are', 'validated', 'nice', 'intelligent', 'human', 'beings', 'Yes', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'movie', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'Yoda', 'puppeteer', 'done', 'right']",N/A

This remake of the Stepford Wives has set a new standard.  Don't even rent it.I do not know what happened - whether they ran out of money for SFX or the stars demanded more of the budget than they'd counted on, but whatever it was, it cost the movie.Basically, there are 2 ways to view this story Scary or Funny.  They failed at both.  The book and original movie were spooky and disturbing.  Frank Oz set out to make the remake a comedy, but failed.  There is no continuity or consistency.  Are the Wives Robots, or brainwashed women?  Either could be true.  One of the deleted scenes shows Bette Midler turn into Inspector Gadget (interesting, since Mathew Broderick is in the film, too) sprouting a variety of kitchen utensils from her fingers, and finally dropping a lawn mower from her butt, which she then rides out into the yard to cut the grass.  It was both disturbing and funny, and there was no doubt that she was a robot.  So they cut the scene.  I think they suddenly realized halfway through the production that they wanted a happy ending, and that wasn't possible if the human wives had been killed and replaced with automatons.  So they cut the scenes where their mechanical nature showed, but not all of them - there's still enough enough glimpses of Faith Hill giving off sparks, and serving as an ATM machine.  The possibilities of the robots had great comic potential, which was abandoned.

848102,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B0002W4UDE,Daryl B,"[5, 6]","I think the best thing that ever happened to Nicole Kidman was Tom Cruise exiting her life.  It seems that since that happened she has had the best film roles of her career.  Although this role can't compete with her performances in ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Hours"", she had fun with this character and with help from talented co-stars Bette Midler, Glenn Close and Christopher Walken, made this a wicked, campy film that is easy to enjoy.I didn't see the first film or read the book so I can't make a comparison. However, I think that making this film differently, the director breathed new life into the remake and gave it a whole new spin.

848104,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B0002W4UDE,David Anderson,"[1, 2]","""Stepford Wives"" is a 2004 remake of the original 1975 version.  It stars Oscar winners Nicole Kidman and Christopher Walker, Oscar nominees Bette Midler and Glenn Close, Matthew Broderick, Jon Lovitz, Faith Hill, and others.  The storyline is brilliant.  Joanna (Kidman), who recently was fired from her job as the president of a broadcasting company, moves to Stepford, CO with her family for hopes of happiness.  As she explores the town, she notices something very odd.  Every female is blonde, unusually beautiful, and a slave to their husbands.  Meanwhile, she meets two normal couples who also recently moved there.  Their curiosity takes a turn as they discover deeply why the town's people behave in such manner.  Then their own sanities become at risk.However, this version has a more hilarious theme where the original one had a more mysterious theme.  This new version has a more interesting plot that keeps audiences interested in every word and event.  The unforgettable humor stays intact throughout the film, yet honoring the original wonderfully.  Though some scenes are somewhat flawed, the enjoyment still lasts a long time.  The witty remarks make up for them.The actors offer their sense of theme within their characters and the film, namely Midler and Kidman.  Midler's signature sass expresses itself wonderfully as Bobby, a successful author.  Nobody could have performed it better.  Country singer Faith Hill makes her triumphant acting debut as one of the Stepford wives.  The only performer who expresses some flaws is Glenn Close but only toward the end.  However, that scene remains entertaining due to the other details.""The Stepford Wives"" is a great film for those looking for some laughs.  This is sure to please many audiences.  Fans of this film should also watch the original version.

848105,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B0002W4UDE,Deborah Earle,"[1, 4]","In this 2004 remake of the 70s sci-fi classic, director Frank Oz gives us an updated view of Ira Levin's novel in the form of a lovely cinematographic dark comedy in lieu of a static documentary.Opening with much of the same footage of 50s housewives featured in ""Mona Lisa Smile"" the previous year, our story begins as Joanna Eberhart( Nicole Kidman) loses her job as a television network executive after an embittered participant in a controversial but high-rated reality program (Mike White) shoots at her onstage during an awards ceremony, and it is discovered that he previously shot other participants of the show as well.As she recovers from a resulting nervous breakdown and electroshock therapy in the hospital, her husband, Walter Kresby(Matthew Broderick), decides to move their family to Stepford, Connecticut, where real estate broker Claire Wellington (a deceptively pleasant Glenn Close) helps them secure a beautiful, ultra-modern home, complete with a little robotic dog whose origins will be deciphered in due time.The couple and their children( Dylan Hartigan, Fallon Brooking) settle into their new life, but Joanna soon finds the behavior of the women to be unsettling: They appear constantly smiling, with childlike docility and vacant expressions in their eyes.Whe she befriends Bobbie Markowitz(Bette Midler), the two lament their inability to have serious intellectual discussions with the women.An element definitely not featured in the original story is the gay relationship of Jerry Harmon( David Marshall Grant), and his giddy partner, Roger Bannister(Roger Bart), the latter of whom befriends Bobbie and Joanna.As a member of the Stepford Men's Association, Walter is exposed to the secret behind the beauty-pageant-contestant-like demeanor of the wives of the community--a point that reaches the height of bizzareness when association member, Ted Van Sant(Robert Stanton) calls his wife, Charmaine (Lorrie Bagely) and uses her as a human ATM.Joanna makes some effort to fit in with the townspeople, but she and Bobbie soon see the once-reliable Roger undergo the same mysterious transformation as the women.When Joanna discovers the high-powered careers the women formerly had, she rushes to tell Bobbie, but is too late: The change has taken hold of her as well, and we see how constant submission to males impairs her  ability to be an efficient mother to her three sons.Joanna confronts the men at their club, and Clair's husband, Mike (Christopher Walken) finally explains the secret of the Stepford Wives' behavior, and for the sake of being with her children, it appears that Joanna will accept this transformation as well.However, at the annual ball, courtesy of Walter, the women literally wake up to themselves, and the resolution of the matter is darkly uproarious, and happily requires no sequel, unlike the original film.Merdeith Viera, Billy Bush, and Larry King have cameos as game show and talk show hosts. John Lovitz plays Bobbie's husband, Dave, and Faith Hill is memorable as Stepford wife, Sarah Sunderson.While panned by many critics, I found this remake to be sunny, relatively upbeat, and hilarious, with a warning about how absolute power corrupts absolutely, and with the situation justly resolved.",3,The American Way of Love?,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,3254,"['2004', 'remake', '70s', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'director', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'updated', 'view', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'novel', 'form', 'lovely', 'cinematographic', 'dark', 'comedy', 'lieu', 'static', 'documentary.Opening', 'much', 'same', 'footage', '50s', 'housewives', 'featured', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'previous', 'year', 'story', 'Joanna', 'Eberhart', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'job', 'television', 'network', 'executive', 'embittered', 'participant', 'controversial', 'high-rated', 'reality', 'program', 'Mike', 'White', 'shoots', 'onstage', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'discovered', 'previously', 'shot', 'other', 'participants', 'show', 'well.As', 'resulting', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'electroshock', 'therapy', 'hospital', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Kresby', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'move', 'family', 'Stepford', 'Connecticut', 'where', 'real', 'estate', 'broker', 'Claire', 'Wellington', 'deceptively', 'pleasant', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'secure', 'beautiful', 'ultra-modern', 'home', 'complete', 'little', 'robotic', 'dog', 'origins', 'will', 'be', 'deciphered', 'due', 'time.The', 'couple', 'children', 'Dylan', 'Hartigan', 'Fallon', 'Brooking', 'settle', 'new', 'life', 'Joanna', 'soon', 'behavior', 'women', 'be', 'unsettling', 'appear', 'constantly', 'smiling', 'childlike', 'docility', 'vacant', 'expressions', 'eyes.Whe', 'Bobbie', 'Markowitz', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'two', 'lament', 'inability', 'have', 'serious', 'intellectual', 'discussions', 'women.An', 'element', 'definitely', 'not', 'featured', 'original', 'story', 'gay', 'relationship', 'Jerry', 'Harmon', 'David', 'Marshall', 'Grant', 'giddy', 'partner', 'Roger', 'Bannister', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'latter', 'whom', 'befriends', 'Bobbie', 'Joanna.As', 'member', 'Stepford', 'Men', 'Association', 'Walter', 'exposed', 'secret', 'beauty-pageant-contestant-like', 'demeanor', 'wives', 'community', 'point', 'height', 'bizzareness', 'when', 'association', 'member', 'Ted', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Robert', 'Stanton', 'wife', 'Charmaine', 'Lorrie', 'Bagely', 'human', 'ATM.Joanna', 'effort', 'fit', 'townspeople', 'Bobbie', 'soon', 'see', 'once-reliable', 'Roger', 'undergo', 'same', 'mysterious', 'transformation', 'women.When', 'Joanna', 'high-powered', 'careers', 'women', 'formerly', 'had', 'tell', 'Bobbie', 'too', 'late', 'change', 'taken', 'hold', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'how', 'constant', 'submission', 'males', 'impairs', 'ability', 'be', 'efficient', 'mother', 'three', 'sons.Joanna', 'men', 'club', 'Clair', 'husband', 'Mike', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'finally', 'secret', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'behavior', 'sake', 'being', 'children', 'Joanna', 'will', 'accept', 'transformation', 'well.However', 'annual', 'ball', 'courtesy', 'Walter', 'women', 'literally', 'wake', 'up', 'resolution', 'matter', 'darkly', 'uproarious', 'happily', 'sequel', 'original', 'film.Merdeith', 'Viera', 'Billy', 'Bush', 'Larry', 'King', 'have', 'cameos', 'game', 'show', 'talk', 'show', 'hosts', 'John', 'Lovitz', 'Bobbie', 'husband', 'Dave', 'Faith', 'Hill', 'memorable', 'Stepford', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Sunderson.While', 'panned', 'many', 'critics', 'found', 'remake', 'be', 'sunny', 'relatively', 'upbeat', 'hilarious', 'warning', 'how', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', 'situation', 'justly', 'resolved']",N/A
848106,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0002W4UDE,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 6]","The ending here is beyond redemption, but otherwise this remake of the 1975 film from the novel by Ira Levin is not (entirely) bad.  It's a different sort of film than the original and probably would amuse (if not offend) Ira Levin if he were alive today.  But to put it bluntly, the film is a sellout to politically correct mentalities and could quite easily be called ""Revenge of the Stepford Wives.""  (Actually there was a TV movie from 1980 by that name that I haven't seen.)The original Stepford Wives starred Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss and was a dark science fiction satire with only a few chuckles and a decidedly dark ending.  This film is played mostly for laughs and is full of all sorts of silly (shall I say stupid?) updates, like having a gay couple instead of a black couple and making the wives (prior to their coming to Stepford) very accomplished--CEOs, scientists, etc., while the husbands are Neanderthal nerds.  Nicole Kidman's Joanna Eberhart was a top TV exec while her husband Walter Kresby (played sheepishly by Matthew Broderick--note that Joanna did not take his last name) is a kind of ordinary joe and caddy to his wife.But what about the premise?  Let's be honest guys.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if our wives were totally devoted to our comfort and pleasure?  If they obeyed us and always kept the house and themselves spotless and catered to our every whim?  If they didn't get moody and were always rational, etc.?  Isn't it the natural state of the human male to be king of his castle and to have dominion over all he surveys?Well, at any rate here's an update on the Stepford Wives for the new millennium, an expansion of the concept, if you will.  Every man has not only a totally devoted and loving wife, but a totally devoted and loving mistress (or two).  They would be robots of course, manufactured as consumer goods by General Electric, Microsoft and Intel.  But here is the zinger: every woman would have a slavishly devoted husband and secret lover, etc.  And while we are at it, they would have loving, appreciative and accomplished robotic children.  In other words, nobody would actually interact with other living, breathing human beings.  How crude, how disgusting.  Instead all humans would interact only with perfect robots perfectly designed to make their world a heaven on earth.Or, more likely we would just be hooked up to an elaborate software program with an utterly convincing virtual reality in which we would have a loyal and loving spouse, two extracurricular lovers..., etc.Fly in the ointment?I think it would be called boredom.Bottom line on this film: a few laughs, a good cast wasted, but a nice documentation of filmland executive stupidity.",2,PC sellout,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2713,"['ending', 'here', 'redemption', 'otherwise', 'remake', '1975', 'film', 'novel', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'different', 'sort', 'film', 'original', 'probably', 'would', 'amuse', 'not', 'offend', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'put', 'bluntly', 'film', 'sellout', 'politically', 'correct', 'mentalities', 'could', 'quite', 'easily', 'be', 'called', 'Revenge', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'Actually', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', '1980', 'name', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'starred', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'was', 'dark', 'science', 'fiction', 'satire', 'only', 'few', 'chuckles', 'decidedly', 'dark', 'ending', 'film', 'played', 'mostly', 'laughs', 'full', 'sorts', 'silly', 'shall', 'say', 'stupid', 'having', 'gay', 'couple', 'instead', 'black', 'couple', 'making', 'wives', 'prior', 'coming', 'Stepford', 'very', 'accomplished', 'CEOs', 'scientists', 'etc.', 'husbands', 'are', 'Neanderthal', 'nerds', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Joanna', 'Eberhart', 'was', 'top', 'TV', 'exec', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Kresby', 'played', 'sheepishly', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'note', 'Joanna', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'last', 'name', 'kind', 'ordinary', 'joe', 'caddy', 'wife.But', 'what', 'premise', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'guys', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'wonderful', 'wives', 'were', 'totally', 'devoted', 'comfort', 'pleasure', 'obeyed', 'always', 'kept', 'house', 'spotless', 'catered', 'whim', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'moody', 'were', 'always', 'rational', 'etc.', ""n't"", 'natural', 'state', 'human', 'male', 'be', 'king', 'castle', 'have', 'dominion', 'surveys', 'Well', 'rate', 'here', 'update', 'Stepford', 'new', 'millennium', 'expansion', 'concept', 'will', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'totally', 'devoted', 'loving', 'wife', 'totally', 'devoted', 'loving', 'mistress', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'robots', 'course', 'manufactured', 'consumer', 'goods', 'General', 'Electric', 'Microsoft', 'Intel', 'here', 'zinger', 'woman', 'would', 'have', 'slavishly', 'devoted', 'husband', 'secret', 'lover', 'etc', 'are', 'would', 'have', 'loving', 'appreciative', 'accomplished', 'robotic', 'children', 'other', 'words', 'nobody', 'would', 'actually', 'interact', 'other', 'living', 'breathing', 'human', 'beings', 'How', 'crude', 'how', 'disgusting', 'Instead', 'humans', 'would', 'interact', 'only', 'perfect', 'robots', 'perfectly', 'designed', 'make', 'world', 'heaven', 'earth.Or', 'more', 'likely', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'hooked', 'up', 'elaborate', 'software', 'program', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'virtual', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'loyal', 'loving', 'spouse', 'two', 'extracurricular', 'lovers', 'etc.Fly', 'ointment', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'boredom.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'few', 'laughs', 'good', 'cast', 'wasted', 'nice', 'documentation', 'filmland', 'executive', 'stupidity']",N/A

Isn't that the truth with remakes though?The beginning was fun with the old 50-60's commercials showing high heeled, overdressed homemakers with plastic smiles, showing off their new kitchen appliances, all the while beautiful music plays.Joanna is a high powered ""Manhattan-ite"" who runs a network of shows like a similar style game show to Millionaire, but basically a battle of the sexes type, and a mix of temptation island vs survivor show called ""I can do better!"" where they mix ""normal people"" with professional prostitutes, and let the fun begin!

Huge mansions, beautiful landscaping, and even more beautiful wives who keep their house spotless and manage to keep their husbands ""happy"" once a day or more, awaits them.Joanna doesn't buy it. Neither do her new friend Bobbie (played by Bette Midler---probably the best character in the movie) and her flamboyant neighbor Roger. They sneak around trying to find out the ""secrets"" of Stepford, or why everyone has gone nuts.Soon Bobbie turns into the perfect wife, and Roger into the perfect ""partner,"" and Joanna turns to her husband for help, (played by Matthew Broderick who I normally love, but seemed a little blah and emotionless throughout) all the while he attends mens club meetings where women are not invited.Did I like it better this way? Not necessarily. But, there were some laugh out loud moments (only a few) and the ending surprised me, gave a new twist with a bit of feminism for the new millenium.But at the same time I wonder, why fix it if it's not broken?

Before hand, I wasn't normally a huge Midler fan but here; she was incredibly funny, sassy and sarcastic. She was the complete anti-thesis of what a Stepford Wife was. Her lines are definately quotable and memorable. The man who played the flighty gay man was hysterical as well and played the role to the hilt. Him and his more conservative partner had reminded me of two dear friends I have in real life, except that I know one would never do that to the other. Christopher Walken was great as always and Glenn Close was a treat as well. The both of them play villains so well. Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick was not that interesting. The only thing that I have ever liked Nicole Kidman in was Moulin Rouge and Broderick, well, his last good film was Ferris Bueller.The film itself was beautifully made, it really did make one feel like that they were in a picturesque township where everything is well-kept and lovely. The special effects weren't that great, because they did nothing to further the plot and seemed to be cut due to budget problems. The one thing is that also too, the plot seems to go back and forth, wanting to be both funny and scary. Which can get neverwracking.But overall, very fabulous and very funny.

Comparing this re-make with the original ""The Stepford Wives,"" which was timely, satirical, and often very creepy, is an insult to the original filmmakers.  When I heard that a former ""Muppeteer"" (aka Frank Oz, aka the voice of Yoda and Grover) was directing this film I started to have reservations.  He is good with comedy (see ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels""), but in this re-make the story wanders from satire to comedy(easily the best moments in the film) to outright science fiction.  By the end of the film I was equal parts bewildered and indifferent.  I tried to believe that Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick were husband and wife, but to no avail.  They come across as buddies, more or less a brother and sister combination than anything intimate.  As for their children, the failing chemistry there is short-lived because they conveniently exit the story early on.  Glenn Close overacts in many scenes.  For that matter, the best character acting here comes from Bette Midler and, dare I say this, singer Faith Hill.  It's just that the story pulls the viewer in so many directions that one more plot twist at the end is really no surprise at all.

But this film is so bad - that nothing could ""spoil"" it more than just plain watching it...This film just plain stinks.  It's a great cast, re-doing a classic thriller, for no reason at all.  There are so many continuity errors in the context of the story that it's an embarrassment.  There are so many unfinished elements that enable so many questions: Were these women disposed of and had robots made in their image, with a June Cleaver makeover?  Or did they just have a chips in their brain?  If so, then why did Bette's hand burn? Why did that other wife spit out cash? Why did Faith Hill send off sparks when she went kablooie during the Square Dance? Why did Nicole Kidman's character see her own robotic image if these women weren't robots?  So, Walken was a robot? I though we were working with computer chips here. Most importantly, why didn't robo-dog get de-robotized when the gigg was up and turn back into a real dog, like the women did?  Poor thing.Holy Moly - this film is a mess. It's definitely a punch in the stomach regarding the role of gender in today's society. It shows men in a very bad light, and doesn't help women either.

It has a perfect combination of comedy, drama, and horror, along with a great cast. A cast including Nicole Kidman, Christpher Walken, and Glenn Close. All of the actors played their roles perfectly, and with a great musical score, ""The Stepford Wives"" could be known as a good remake. The film is based on a book that was made into a movie, which was made into this movie. I have yet to see the first ""Stepford Wives"" but if I do, I hope that it is good, if not better, than this one.The movie is about Joanna Eberhart, who is known as ""the hardest working women in television."" She is the president of EBS, a station focused on reality television. Her husband Walter Kresby, is the vice-president. Joanna is fired, though, after a crazy man from her new show ""I Can Do Better"" tries to kill her. Walter also quits, and they move to start a new life in Stepford Connecticut. Walter notices that everything is odd, with all the houses being so big, and all the wives to be. . . amazing. They are perfect in everyway, and they wait on the husbands on hand and foot. Joanna notices that something is wrong, and she then befriends Bobbie Markowitz, the writer of ""I Love You But Please Die"" the book about her relationship with her mother. Bobbie agrees that something is odd, and then they meet Roger, one half of a gay couple in Stepford. Things go wrong when Walter joins the mens association, and learns about the men's plot to perfect the wives, created by Mike Wellington. Joanna decides to find out what is going on, while also trying not to become a Stepford wife herself.A reason why some people might not like ""The Stepford Wives"" is because they are comparing it to the first movie. Some people could believe that nothing can compare to the first movie, and they list the faults and differences of this one. They are two different movies, and it is nice when people don't compare the two.A big plus of ""The Stepford Wives"" is the musical score. The music is perfect for the tone and mood of the film, a kind of dark, scary, foreshadowing mood that is apparant during the opening credits. I loved ""The Stepford Wives."" It is not the kind of movie that you expect to see at the Oscars next year, but it is worth a check out if you want and hour and a half of pure fun.

Frank Oz's 2004 ""The Stepford Wives"" remake of the 1975 original, which was based on the book by Ira Levin, suffers from a major identity problem.  The film itself doesn't seem to know what its message is and is annoyingly scatterbrained, throwing around different plot elements from the genres mentioned above with no real center or focus.  If the filmmakers don't know what the point of their film is, neither do viewers, whom are left confused and unsure of what to make of it all as the credits role.The story is an absolute mess and seems to be stitched together from numerous different scripts, each focusing on a different element; humor, thrills, sci-fi, and horror.  The result is a story where the pieces simply don't match up.  This puzzling blend of genre and plot elements along with multiple endings is no doubt to be blamed on the reportedly vehemently dissatisfied test audiences.  Frank Oz allegedly kept cutting, editing, and at times reshooting entire scenes up until a month or so before release.  It shows.The all star cast of the great Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken, and Faith Hill are tragically wasted on this bland, perplexing, and ultimately dissatisfying film.",2,"""The wives of Stepford have a secret""",1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,1359,"['Look', 'comedy', 'No', 'thriller', 'No', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'No', 'horror', 'film', 'Wait', 'what', 'heck', 'Frank', 'Oz', '2004', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'remake', '1975', 'original', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'suffers', 'major', 'identity', 'problem', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'message', 'annoyingly', 'scatterbrained', 'throwing', 'around', 'different', 'plot', 'elements', 'genres', 'mentioned', 'real', 'center', 'focus', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'neither', 'do', 'viewers', 'whom', 'are', 'left', 'confused', 'unsure', 'what', 'make', 'credits', 'role.The', 'story', 'absolute', 'mess', 'be', 'stitched', 'together', 'numerous', 'different', 'scripts', 'focusing', 'different', 'element', 'humor', 'thrills', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'result', 'story', 'where', 'pieces', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'puzzling', 'blend', 'genre', 'plot', 'elements', 'multiple', 'endings', 'doubt', 'be', 'blamed', 'reportedly', 'vehemently', 'dissatisfied', 'test', 'audiences', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'allegedly', 'kept', 'cutting', 'editing', 'times', 'reshooting', 'entire', 'scenes', 'up', 'month', 'so', 'release', 'shows.The', 'star', 'cast', 'great', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Faith', 'Hill', 'are', 'tragically', 'wasted', 'bland', 'perplexing', 'ultimately', 'dissatisfying', 'film']",N/A
848124,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B0002W4UDE,Erica Anderson,"[0, 0]","I wasn't sure if I wanted to see updated version of ""The Stepford Wives"". As campy as the original film was, it certainly was engaging. I changed my find and finally saw the film last night. I thought it was funny and entertaining. As always Nicole Kidman looked great in this film as Joanna Eberhardt but for me I thought Glenn Close and Bette Midler were the real stars of the film. Glenn was really over the top as Claire Wellington. Bette was hilarious as the sarcastic Bobbie Markovitz. I especially cracked up during the book club scene where Bobbie was totally snide and sarcastic to Claire. For her acting debut, country singer Faith Hill was fairly decent but I didn't see enough to make a final judgement. She could have done a much worse job. Her role was small which is why I can't really say she did a good or a bad job. Unfortunately I couldn't really buy into the fact that Matthew Broderick played Nicole Kidman's husband Walter in the film. All I could think was Ferris Bueller during the parade on the float singing ""Twist and Shout"". Christopher Walken was wonderful as Claire's husband Mike. A very subtle performance from Christopher. It is good to see Christopher Walken explore comedy. Of course what is a movie without your token gay companion? I liked the actor who played the flamboyant Jerry but to be honest was his character that necessary to the film? The movie starts off really good as Joanna Eberhardt getting canned from the male-bashing network of EBS and she and her family moving to Stepford, Conneticut. Unfortunately the film goes beyond over the top and completely jumps the shark (and a giant squid) towards the end of the film. I think it would have been more interesting had this film stayed true to the satirical aspect of the book and film on feminism than having it wind up as a ridiculous comedy. The ending was pretty silly. For all its flaws, ""The Stepford Wives"" was a funny movie. I was entertained through out the film despite the silliness of the ending which I felt ruined the theme of the anti-feminism idealogy. Nevertheless it was good to see Bette Midler and Glenn Close on the big screen again. Their presence reassured me that actors of their age and stature still has a place in film and still can be funny.",3,Funny movie but...,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,2268,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'see', 'updated', 'version', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'As', 'campy', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'was', 'engaging', 'changed', 'find', 'finally', 'saw', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'always', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'looked', 'great', 'film', 'Joanna', 'Eberhardt', 'thought', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'were', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'Glenn', 'was', 'really', 'top', 'Claire', 'Wellington', 'Bette', 'was', 'hilarious', 'sarcastic', 'Bobbie', 'Markovitz', 'especially', 'cracked', 'up', 'book', 'club', 'scene', 'where', 'Bobbie', 'was', 'totally', 'snide', 'sarcastic', 'Claire', 'acting', 'debut', 'country', 'singer', 'Faith', 'Hill', 'was', 'fairly', 'decent', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'make', 'final', 'judgement', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'worse', 'job', 'role', 'was', 'small', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'did', 'good', 'bad', 'job', 'Unfortunately', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'fact', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'husband', 'Walter', 'film', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'parade', 'float', 'singing', 'Twist', 'Shout', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Claire', 'husband', 'Mike', 'very', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Christopher', 'good', 'see', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'explore', 'comedy', 'course', 'what', 'movie', 'token', 'gay', 'companion', 'liked', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'flamboyant', 'Jerry', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'character', 'necessary', 'film', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'Joanna', 'Eberhardt', 'getting', 'canned', 'male-bashing', 'network', 'EBS', 'family', 'moving', 'Stepford', 'Conneticut', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'top', 'completely', 'shark', 'giant', 'squid', 'end', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'film', 'stayed', 'true', 'satirical', 'aspect', 'book', 'film', 'feminism', 'having', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'comedy', 'ending', 'was', 'pretty', 'silly', 'flaws', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'was', 'funny', 'movie', 'was', 'entertained', 'film', 'silliness', 'ending', 'felt', 'ruined', 'theme', 'anti-feminism', 'idealogy', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'big', 'screen', 'again', 'presence', 'reassured', 'actors', 'age', 'stature', 'still', 'place', 'film', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'funny']",N/A

848127,A2CPM6AEJHVNKL,B0002W4UDE,Found Highways,"[4, 6]","The 2004 movie version of Ira Levin's novel The Stepford Wives  reminds me of what Karl Marx said about history repeating itself: ""the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.""I want to be clear. This movie is the worst remake I have ever seen, and I'm including Jessica Lange's first movie, the 1976 version of King Kong. (I'm not blaming her for that, though - - it wasn't beauty killed THAT beast).The main problem here is that these new Stepford wives are in a big-budget picture instead of the modern equivalent of a B movie. By putting together ""elements"" like Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick it was always going to be a mainstream film that needed to earn tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. So the filmmakers purposely made a comedy version which allowed them to have a happy ending that they thought a mass audience would like.We even find out at the end that men are soon to be the victims of the Stepford process too, poor babies. (I enjoyed Jon Lovitz and Bette Midler, but I could watch them do the same shtick on reruns of Seinfeld. In fact this movie sounded more than anything else like Ira Levin being channeled by the writers of Will and Grace.)The 1975 version directed by Bryan Forbes agitated both the audience who recognized Joanna's desperation and the audience who thought the movie was a vicious male backlash. Not everybody got it, but everybody was affected by it. In 2004 The Stepford Wives upsets no one.The are a few nods to Bryan Forbes's movie. We first see Mike (Christopher Walken), the apparent Stepford Svengali, dressed in black the way his forerunner Diz was when Joanna challenged him in her kitchen back in 1975. But Walken just plays his usual freak and doesn't unnerve the way the low-budget film and TV actor Patrick O'Neal did.This time the name Eberhardt belongs to Joanna - - her husband has his own last name. This shows how feminism changed over thirty years (if you can get anyone, man or woman, to use the F-word any more) - - unimportant things have changed for the better, but in important areas things have gone backwards.Just the fact that someone could think to tell this story as a comedy shows that the first Joanna didn't make it out of Stepford alive.How have things changed for men in thirty years in Stepford? When the Men's Association got together in 1975 their conversation was so inane that Joanna didn't understand how her husband Walter could stand to listen to it. In 2004 the husbands play with toy SUVs in their clubhouse (their big ones are parked outside) the way the upper-class idiots in P. G. Wodehouse's Drones Club played cricket with rolls.SPOILERS FROM HERE (AS IF YOU COULDN'T SEE THEM COMING):There's one moment of wit when Glenn Close (not surprisingly the real mistress in Stepford) tells everyone she's neither a person nor a machine - - ""I'm a lady.""The main difference between the two Stepfords is that in 1975 Diz and the husbands kill their wives. In an attempt at a scary scene, Nicole Kidman's Joanna Mark MMIV comes across a robotic simulacrum of herself lying on a slab. The robot's eyes jerk open to show only blackness - - what Katharine Ross saw in her double's face as it combed its long hair.So we think that this Joanna, like her predecessor, is going to be eliminated and replaced by a robot. But in the second-to-the-last scene Walter deactivates nanochips implanted in the brains of all the Stepford wives and they return to normal. So they weren't killed and replaced by robots. Why does Joanna have a spooky robot but the other Stepford wives don't?And it's too bad that in thirty years we needed to go back to stories where the husband decides if the wife lives or dies.When the members of the Men's Association reveal their secret to Walter (unlike the first movie, there's no hint that Walter brought Joanna to Stepford knowing what was going to happen to her - - cute Matthew Broderick wouldn't do THAT) they demonstrate their power by having one of the wife-robots dispense cash from her mouth like an ATM. We already know that money is the only important thing to Stepfordites and should be to us too (after all, the husbands are doing this because their wives make bigger salaries and are more successful than they are), but how do you get the cash into a human body?Movies like this remind me why, overall, I like B-movies better than big-budget films. There is hardly ever any human feeling in a movie with a big star in it. If we weren't Stepford Audiences, maybe we'd get better movies than this version of The Stepford Wives.",1,"""American woman stay away from me . . .""",1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,4556,"['2004', 'movie', 'version', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'novel', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'what', 'Karl', 'Marx', 'said', 'history', 'repeating', 'first', 'time', 'tragedy', 'second', 'farce', 'want', 'be', 'clear', 'movie', 'worst', 'remake', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'including', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'first', 'movie', '1976', 'version', 'King', 'Kong', ""'m"", 'not', 'blaming', 'was', ""n't"", 'beauty', 'killed', 'THAT', 'beast', '.The', 'main', 'problem', 'here', 'new', 'Stepford', 'wives', 'are', 'big-budget', 'picture', 'instead', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'B', 'movie', 'putting', 'together', 'elements', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'mainstream', 'film', 'needed', 'earn', 'tens', 'not', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'filmmakers', 'purposely', 'made', 'comedy', 'version', 'allowed', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'thought', 'mass', 'audience', 'would', 'like.We', 'even', 'find', 'out', 'end', 'men', 'are', 'soon', 'be', 'victims', 'Stepford', 'process', 'too', 'poor', 'babies', 'enjoyed', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'could', 'watch', 'do', 'same', 'shtick', 'reruns', 'Seinfeld', 'fact', 'movie', 'sounded', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'being', 'channeled', 'writers', 'Will', 'Grace', '1975', 'version', 'directed', 'Bryan', 'Forbes', 'agitated', 'audience', 'who', 'recognized', 'Joanna', 'desperation', 'audience', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'vicious', 'male', 'backlash', 'Not', 'everybody', 'got', 'everybody', 'was', 'affected', '2004', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'one.The', 'are', 'few', 'nods', 'Bryan', 'Forbes', 'movie', 'first', 'see', 'Mike', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'apparent', 'Stepford', 'Svengali', 'dressed', 'black', 'way', 'forerunner', 'Diz', 'was', 'when', 'Joanna', 'challenged', 'kitchen', 'back', '1975', 'Walken', 'just', 'usual', 'freak', ""n't"", 'unnerve', 'way', 'low-budget', 'film', 'TV', 'actor', 'Patrick', ""O'Neal"", 'did.This', 'time', 'name', 'Eberhardt', 'Joanna', 'husband', 'own', 'last', 'name', 'how', 'feminism', 'changed', 'thirty', 'years', 'can', 'get', 'anyone', 'man', 'woman', 'use', 'F-word', 'more', 'unimportant', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'better', 'important', 'areas', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'backwards.Just', 'fact', 'someone', 'could', 'think', 'tell', 'story', 'comedy', 'first', 'Joanna', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Stepford', 'alive.How', 'have', 'things', 'changed', 'men', 'thirty', 'years', 'Stepford', 'When', 'Men', 'Association', 'got', 'together', '1975', 'conversation', 'was', 'so', 'inane', 'Joanna', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'husband', 'Walter', 'could', 'stand', 'listen', '2004', 'husbands', 'play', 'toy', 'SUVs', 'clubhouse', 'big', 'ones', 'are', 'parked', 'way', 'upper-class', 'idiots', 'P.', 'G.', 'Wodehouse', 'Drones', 'Club', 'played', 'cricket', 'rolls.SPOILERS', 'FROM', 'HERE', 'IF', 'YOU', 'COULD', ""N'T"", 'SEE', 'THEM', 'COMING', 'one', 'moment', 'wit', 'when', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'real', 'mistress', 'Stepford', 'everyone', 'person', 'machine', ""'m"", 'lady', 'main', 'difference', 'two', 'Stepfords', '1975', 'Diz', 'husbands', 'kill', 'wives', 'attempt', 'scary', 'scene', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Joanna', 'Mark', 'MMIV', 'robotic', 'simulacrum', 'lying', 'slab', 'robot', 'eyes', 'jerk', 'open', 'show', 'only', 'blackness', 'what', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'saw', 'double', 'face', 'combed', 'long', 'hair.So', 'think', 'Joanna', 'predecessor', 'going', 'be', 'eliminated', 'replaced', 'robot', 'second-to-the-last', 'scene', 'Walter', 'nanochips', 'implanted', 'brains', 'Stepford', 'wives', 'return', 'normal', 'were', ""n't"", 'killed', 'replaced', 'robots', 'Why', 'Joanna', 'have', 'spooky', 'robot', 'other', 'Stepford', 'wives', 'do', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'thirty', 'years', 'needed', 'go', 'back', 'stories', 'where', 'husband', 'wife', 'dies.When', 'members', 'Men', 'Association', 'reveal', 'secret', 'Walter', 'first', 'movie', 'hint', 'Walter', 'brought', 'Joanna', 'Stepford', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'cute', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'demonstrate', 'power', 'having', 'one', 'wife-robots', 'dispense', 'cash', 'mouth', 'ATM', 'already', 'know', 'money', 'only', 'important', 'thing', 'Stepfordites', 'should', 'be', 'too', 'husbands', 'are', 'doing', 'wives', 'make', 'bigger', 'salaries', 'are', 'more', 'successful', 'are', 'how', 'do', 'get', 'cash', 'human', 'body', 'Movies', 'remind', 'why', 'overall', 'like', 'B-movies', 'better', 'big-budget', 'films', 'hardly', 'ever', 'human', 'feeling', 'movie', 'big', 'star', 'were', ""n't"", 'Stepford', 'Audiences', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'get', 'better', 'movies', 'version', 'Stepford', 'Wives']",N/A

On one side were left-wing ones like VISUALIZE WORLD PEACE and ARMS ARE FOR HUGGING.  On the other side were conservative quips like ABORTION IS MURDER and I'M THE NRA AND I VOTE.  He did this to confuse anyone trying to figure out what he believed.This movie does the same thing.  In reading the prior reviews it is interesting to see how some interpret it as a left-wing PC film and others dismiss it as anti-female.  What it really is is incoherent.  Kidman's character, for example....is she a virtuous heroine or a sleezeball ""Jerry Springer with breasts"" who ruins lives for ratings?  Is Broderick a ""real"" man or a wimp?  And if this community is an idealized 1950s clone then why is it so accepting of gay people?The wives - they appear to be simultaneously robots and humans.  If the nano-chips are the only physical modification then what is the deal with the robot bodies?  And the ending - is Midler's opinion of men the real theme of the movie, or is it a parody poking fun at men-bashing ultra-feminists?One more question: if this is a comedy where were the funny moments?Maybe the producers were trying to be all things to all people.  Maybe it was a case of too many cooks spoiling the soup.  Or maybe the writers just suck at their jobs.

The ""Stepford Wives"" was once image-provoking short hand for the manifestation of conformity and the absence of control.  That idea still sells. In fact, it's interesting that The Manuchurian Candidate and this film appeared in such temporal proximity to one another.  For some reason The Manchurian Candidate can still prompt one to think about the prospect of manipulation at high levels.  That may quite possibly stem from the alleged influence of money in politics or other factors that seem to influence decision-making at the highest levels.  But Stepford Wives, well-acted as it was, is fun, but not fundamentally thought provoking.  Yet, there's a morale in it: the ability to manipulate the other sex lacks appeal as theory, even if it were feasible in practice.  Much like the orgy in Eyes Wide Shut, where the regimentation and ritualization of sex dampens its appeal, the ability to manipulate mechanistically a community of wives is a one-way ticket to dystopia.  Stil, if you can suspend belief long enough to enjoy it, it's a fine comedy.

All that we demand of you is that you open the greenback floodgates on opening weekend, for the film's monetary successes in subsequent weeks and weekends is only dressing as far as we're concerned.""Go figure. Such an ideological perspective perfectly sums up ""The Stepford Wives."" A highly enrapturing trailer coupled with a ho-hum production. To be earnest, ""The Stepford Wives"" is one of those films that kept me from fleeing its piteousness for precisely two reasons and two reasons alone. One, the prospect of a ""twist ending"" grasped me by the gobbler. Having seen the hauntingly insidious closure of the original, I kept thinking to myself, ""Where will they go different?"" I must say, I was not disappointed. Secondly, upon hearing of the casting of Bette Midler as a tye-dyed slob novelist and the creepily hilarious Christopher Walken as Mike Wellington, Stepford's top citizen and president of the illustrious Men's Association, was enamored in glee. Truth be told, their performances and the twist that rears its head the last 20 minutes or so were the only redeeming qualities of the picture.The original film, based on the novel by Ira Levin, was gratifying because it possessed a range of emotions. It was exceptionally competent at making the viewer tremble in fright, gasp in disbelief and belt out a hearty laugh all within a small window of time. The original didn't require CGI to make the audience believe that these women were indeed robots. Nor did the original film require metalloid dogs or automated refrigerators to amuse the viewer. Certainly, the mood and pacing of the first film were impeccable.Furthermore, the initial ""Stepford Wives"" was really saying something of the utmost importance with an unshakable black stare (literally and figuratively).Simply put, the original film is a bona fide masterpiece. The remake is nothing more than feel-good celluloid blather.",2,Don't bother paying a visit to this Stepford,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,2959,"['have', 'been', 'swindled', 'Mark', 'words', 'trailer', 'trap', 'will', 'not', 'snag', 'again', 'Nevermore', 'will', 'sniveling', 'studio', 'tyrants', 'seize', 'hold', '6', 'change', 'pocketbook', 'formula', 'financial', 'success', 'movie', 'biz', 'become', 'twofold', 'matter', 'fact', 'now', 'know', 'be', 'true.Last', 'week', 'was', 'traversing', 'countryside', 'wee', 'man', 'sporting', 'shirt', 'initials', 'grunted', 'No', 'more', 'remake', 'rubbish', 'Paramount', 'Studios', 'directorial', 'guidelines', 'Sept.', '1', '2003', 'said', 'fine', 'type', 'top', 'page', 'Remake', 'something', 'cult', 'classic', 'stature', 'be', 'sure', 'intravenously', 'inject', 'picture', 'loads', 'shock', 'quick', 'cuts', 'sophomoric', 'quips', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'slick', 'up', 'mass', 'appeal', 'eliminate', 'clever', 'witticisms', 'might', 'intellectually', 'engage', 'audience', 'B', 'VERY', 'IMPORTANT', 'Remember', 'film', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'well', 'done', 'Instead', 'focus', 'efforts', 'making', 'memorable', 'trailer', 'spoilage', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'majority', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'necessary', 'achieving', 'such', 'effect', 'so', 'be', 'demand', 'open', 'greenback', 'opening', 'weekend', 'film', 'monetary', 'successes', 'subsequent', 'weeks', 'weekends', 'only', 'dressing', 'as', 'far', ""'re"", 'concerned', 'Go', 'figure', 'ideological', 'perspective', 'perfectly', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'highly', 'enrapturing', 'trailer', 'coupled', 'ho-hum', 'production', 'be', 'earnest', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'one', 'films', 'kept', 'fleeing', 'piteousness', 'precisely', 'two', 'reasons', 'two', 'reasons', 'alone', 'One', 'prospect', 'twist', 'ending', 'grasped', 'gobbler', 'Having', 'seen', 'hauntingly', 'insidious', 'closure', 'original', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'Where', 'will', 'go', 'different', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Secondly', 'hearing', 'casting', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'tye-dyed', 'slob', 'novelist', 'creepily', 'hilarious', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Mike', 'Wellington', 'Stepford', 'top', 'citizen', 'president', 'illustrious', 'Men', 'Association', 'was', 'enamored', 'glee', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'performances', 'twist', 'head', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'were', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'picture.The', 'original', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'was', 'gratifying', 'possessed', 'range', 'emotions', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'competent', 'making', 'viewer', 'tremble', 'fright', 'gasp', 'disbelief', 'belt', 'out', 'hearty', 'small', 'window', 'time', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'CGI', 'make', 'audience', 'believe', 'women', 'were', 'indeed', 'robots', 'did', 'original', 'film', 'require', 'metalloid', 'dogs', 'automated', 'refrigerators', 'amuse', 'viewer', 'Certainly', 'mood', 'pacing', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'impeccable.Furthermore', 'initial', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'was', 'really', 'saying', 'something', 'utmost', 'importance', 'unshakable', 'black', 'stare', 'literally', 'figuratively', '.Simply', 'put', 'original', 'film', 'bona', 'fide', 'masterpiece', 'remake', 'nothing', 'more', 'feel-good', 'celluloid', 'blather']",N/A

It seemed Frank Oz was hoping to make some kind of dark comedy out of the original movie, but no one seemed to know where to go in this movie, waiting for the mighty Oz to signal the command. There are a few comic moments but they seem lost in this pathetic tale of suburbia borrowed more from the antebellum South than from suburban Connecticut.  It was a real disappointment to see such fine actors reduced to playing parodies of the original movie.  Oz defies all logic in the end, as he tries to undo the Stepford Wives forgetting that they were robots, not programmed women.

I would rather be zinged by one-liners than bored by predictability. And I certainly don't want to sit and roll my eyes in the dark at jokes that fall flat. Tongue-in-cheek? No way! Hammer-handed is more like it! Screenwriter Paul Rudnick...do we thank you for 92 minutes of sparkling repartee? Not! How about director Frank Oz?  Where were you when it was decided to base an entire movie on these 2004 Stepford women, all dressed in retro pastel florals, with paste-on smiles and one line responses? ""The Stepford Wives"" plays more as a series of silly, stereotypical vignettes than as a motion picture. There was real comedic potential to be explored here - and the opportunity was totally squandered. What a waste!Nicole Kidman! Matthew Broderik! Glenn Close, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler! The movie has a terrific cast - great actors all. So, who put the wooden words in their mouths? Someone wake-up! What's wrong with this picture? Where's the credible plot? I loved the 1975 horror-thriller and was looking forward to the remake and some good laughs. I should have stayed home.Joanna Eberhart, (Nicole Kidman), a Type A, obsessively driven career woman, is fired from her job as cable network president because of a PR SNAFU. She has a nervous breakdown and hubby Walter, (Matthew Broderick), moves the family to the upscale, gated suburban community of Stepford, CT for R&R.; The Eberhart family soon discovers that life in Stepford is a bit on the twisted side. Here the sun always shines, as do the children and the house. All the wives are carbon copies of June Cleaver crossbred with Marilyn Monroe - and all blondes too. The women-wives never have a hair out of place. Their nails are always manicured, dresses perfectly pressed - that's right - dresses! They even exercise in high heels and dresses - the same floral pastels. OK. We get it. Next joke! Meals are all on time, Dad's time, of course, and all meals are made from scratch. A feminist's nightmare landscape - on the money - repeatedly!  How and why do these women, er, sex kitten bimbos, do this?? Ask their hubbies. Ooops. We can't. The guys, excuse me, the shlubby hubbies, are all hanging out at the Men's Club, back-slapping over what a cushy life they lead.Why don't any of the Stepford newcomer couples notice the strange doings? My question would presume there is something remotely believable in the screenplay which would merit a question. A five year-old would pick up on the ""Stepfordish"" ambiance a few minutes into the film, (the reference is to the 1975 film with the credible automaton wives).  Don't the kids see what's happening to Mommy? So, why don't Nicole and Matt, to say nothing of the extremely sly and witty Ms. Midler, see the weirdness taking place right under their collective noses? I guess it's called Bigtime Bucks!!Mr. Rudnick's remade updates just don't jive. The women of Stepford are no longer anonymous housewives but high power professionals who attended Ivy League schools. Women who work at home aren't good enough for Hollywood? They have to be surgeons and judges before they decide to stay at home? Wives are not turned into robots but instead have microchips imbedded in their brains to control them. So, if she's not a robot, how come when you put an ATM card in her mouth dollar bills come out? And why, when you push a remote, does her [...] size increases? Duh! The ending is gratuitous, convoluted and just plain sloppy. Ok. I'll tell it like it is, no holds barred. This was the single worst ending to a film that I have ever seen - especially a remake where someone should have known better. It deserves an award!! And I will be happy to give one - 1 Star.

Corsi,"[2, 4]","It's amazing how when I talked to people and told them I got this movie, the guys all pretty much go ""oh thats nice"" in a non believing way yet the girls go in depth with a certain scene. I have seen the original a few years ago so my memory isn't all to great about it but it does resemble this movie to a degree. This time though it more geared towards nowadays everywhere from technology to even a gay couple (one of them which is even running for mayor in this movie). I'd give you the brief rundown of this movie but you probably all heard it by now but here we go anyways. A wife gets stressed out when she loses her job, so the whole family move to a town called Stepford. All the females seem just so perfect there and dress in the housewife garb (are sundresses actually housewife garb come to think of it)? The woman all tone up and make sure their husbands are happy no matter what while the men all go to a secret club where they enjoy the finer things in life (or in this case make them). But wait, how did these woman get so perfect? Why are the people just moving in all changing to perfection? And why did the one gay guy turn.... well not so gay? watch this movie and find out. Though I will agree with the one reviewer who said the 15 minutes of the movie kinda raises some questions.

848150,A140XH16IKR4B0,B0002W4UDE,Jean E. Pouliot,"[10, 12]","Full of promise but disjointed in writing and appearance, ""The Stepford Wives"" explores life in a suspiciously perfect suburban town. Nicole Kidman (terrific!) plays Joanna Eberhard, a corporate superwoman recently fired after a spectacular business failure. Husband Walter Kresby (Ha ha! funny name!), played by a sleepwalking Matthew Broderick, is her supportive, yet lonely and unhappy husband. They move to postcard-perfect Stepford, Connecticutt in order to put balance back into their lives and their marriage. But something is not right in paradise. Newly-arrived wives cringe at the porcelain perfection of the town's pretty little housewives. Yet their husbands seem to thrive in the forced atmosphere of male camaraderie, cigar smoking, barn dancing and generally wholesome fun. What is behind the disparity is at the core of the movie.Aside from turning a horror movie into a comedy, removing any element of peril, the Stepford writers don't try too hard to update the original. They lift the ambience, attitudes and assumptions of the 1960s and airdrop them into post-modern 2004. The movie does add a gay couple and a hippy Jewish couple (actually, played hilariously by Jon Lovitz and Bette Midler) which are the extent of the life in this tepid and lifeless movie. But in trying to pay homage to the original, they left some very loose strings. In the original, the human wives were killed and replaced by robots. In this most timid remake, the wives are merely electronically enhanced. Yet the witless writers try to have their remake cake and eat the original too. They retain the original's trademark horror scene -- where a wife comes face to face with her mechanical replacement -- even though the remake uses no robots. That's sloppy, dumb and insulting.""The Stepford Wives"" imperfectly transposes male-female power struggles from the 1960s to the 2000s. Thirty years ago, men were threatened by the very presence of women in traditionally male-oriented jobs. Replacing them with electronic love dolls satirized the era's male angst. Today, the film has us believe, men are threatened by uber-successful women. This weak translation hardly taps into the everyday experience of most men, who have adapted quite well to the reality of women in the workplace, notwithstanding the fulminations of certain talk-radio programs. The film also has us believe that men want their wives to be bouffant-haired hostesses sitting around baking cookies and making Christmas ornaments. The widespread disdain for Martha Stewart might have been a clue that this decade's angst lies elsewhere.""Stepford Wives"" is a bit of tasteless yet harmless entertainment, like a slice of leftover bundt cake in the fridge.

Christopher Walken (The Rundown) and Mathew Brodwick (Election) are good but their parts a pretty flat, anyone could've played them basically.

I found it delightful.Nicole Kidman plays a powerful TV executive and Matthew Broderick plays her somewhat weak-willed husband. After she suffers a breakdown, he decides to move the family to a seemingly idyllic suburban community in Connecticut. The place seems too good to be true. All the houses are mansions, all the yards are neatly manicured, all the neighbors are friendly and all of the wives are beautiful. Mostly, though, all the wives are submissive ""50s"" moms who exist only to comfort the husbands.This last realization does not come all at once. The men, particularly Broderick, take the situation as normal. It is the newly arrived women who think things are strange. In Kidman's words, ""It's not natural for the men to be so happy."" Her friend, played by Bette Middler, makes another odd observation: all of the women are beauty queens and the men are geeks. It's just not natural.  ""When her friend turns from a shrew to a housewife extraordinaire, she becomes frightened and begins to do some checking. She learns that each of the complacent and submissive women used to be a powerful executive of some type or another. In her fright, she determines to take her children and flee. The problem is that the kids are missing. When she confronts the community leaders, she learns the shocking secret.It is unclear in the film what is happening. Either the wives are being replaced with submissive robots or they are being programmed with chips in the brain.

It was closer to the made-for-TV sequels than anything Levin wrote.A network president is fired.  She and her husband, who quit his network job in sympathy, move to the small town of Stepford where the unemployed couple buy a five-million-dollar house complete with a robot dog.  But soon we ee that things are a little strange in Stepford (and I don't meant the Bette Midler-John Lovitz couple).Some of the plot follows the original story (at least when the friends check up on a woman who seemed to have been injured) but most of the movie is new and unoriginal.  I am not sure why there was square dancing.  But as the plot develops we get a cross between the original novel (the wives are changes in some way) and the original movie (the wives have been replaced).  The movie keeps going back and forth between the two explanations and both are shown as true.In the end one wonders what really went on.  If powerful spouses are being pacified, why is one replacement running for Senate?  Many other such inconsistencies abound.  But this is explained in part if you listen to the commentary.

By accident mind you on digital t.v. with nothing else to show. I would have rather watched my cats poo in the litter box. At least you know crap when you see it! This waste of celluloid tries to put one over on us as a smart snarky remake of a truly horrifying film. This has nothing on the 1975 original. Perhaps I'm biased, I did read the book after all. What can I say about truly great actors giving truly awful performances that would only be appropriate at Madame Tussauds. Maybe they were hoping the talented artists would see them and beg them to duplicate their awesomeness for the unsuspecting tourists. If you paid for a ticket to see this when it came out, my sincerest apologies. You were robbed. This movie takes the terrifying premise of emasculated men who meet at the Men's Association so they can plot how best to duplicate their ambitious wives and turn them into a bad version of ""Barbie Girl"" and  turns it into a joke. Gone are the creepy insidious men who are picking off their wives one by one. We have a clever--NOT-- movie where the poor little husbands are feeling neglected by their successful wives, decide to replace them with Donna Reed and Mrs. Cleaver, so the poor women won't figure out that their shrinking pride matches their shriveled manhood. It could have been funny, but the movie presents itself as a dark comedy when all it is really is a poor imitation. Every actor from Christopher Walken to Bette Midler is wasted. Maybe not Faith Hill, she's so wooden you don't really notice that she's pretending to be a robot. And I didn't find the ATM joke one bit funny, I did feel sorry for the dog. Why replace the dog?

848167,A7IIPRUAEZ2N6,B0002W4UDE,Kendrik Lau,"[4, 4]","No, not die laughing. I have recently ""re-discovered"" the original movie starring Katharine Ross and I have heard about the scathing reviews and reactions from critics and moviegoers about the remake.The remake was done as a comedy and with an ensemble cast with Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Glenn Close, and Christopher Walken, how can you go wrong? Maybe the movie is not as bad it was made out to be? Perhaps everybody is so in love with the original Katharine Ross classic that they are unfairly comparing the remake and the original.So I watched this movie with an open mind and it started promisingly enough, Nicole Kidman plays the Katharine Ross character, in name only. She doesn't take pictures anymore but here she seems to have a knack of creating reality shows specializing in the emasculation and humiliation of the male gender. When one of her ""victims"" on these shows went ballistic in public, Kidman's character was fired from the resultant fallout and as damage control.She and her mild house husband packed up and leave for the quaint town of Stepford and that is when everything in the movie just went down hill.Filmed as a comedy, The Stepford Wives just isn't that funny, despite that fact that they included a gay couple - a straight acting Republican and his flamboyant flaming significant other. There are no classic lines delivery like ""I'd just die if I don't get that recipe!"". In fact I did not find the jokes funny at all. Perhaps it's the lack of comic timing and the delivery. The scene where the wives are singing Christmas songs and the camera panning over to see Bette Midler sitting idly nearby wearing reindeer antler just isn't that clever, or funny, or even obnoxious.In any case, as a lot of the reviwer pointed out, there is a huge plot hole here. The wives have been addressed by various characters as being robots, is it literally or figuratively speaking? Because it seems the film decided to change the plot halfway in.And speaking of plot changing, this is another thing that I dislike this movie. I lamented that movie nowadays explained everything to you and force feed the audience. The Stepford Wives takes the cake when Matthew Broderick stumbled upon a film featuring Christopher Walken explaining away how the wives are transformed via cyberbetic implants into their brains (a la the Borgs). I got the feeling this was filmed after major revisions was done to the script and was shoehorned into the film. And in the end, the real villain of the piece is revealed and she, too, gave a long rambling speech about who, how and why was she trying to convert people into ""robots"".In the end, I was so disgusted and disappointed with this movie that I didn't even bother checking out the extras, which I heard included a deleted scene where Bette Midler became a anthropomorphic vaccum cleaner.The Stepford Wives had the potential to be a very funny film, but somehow the execution failed in a major catastrophic way, squandering the talents of the ensemble cast. I am quite surprised that a sizable number of reviewers would dare to give this movie a four or five stars rating. I suspect the IQ level of America is dropping and this is a definite sign. I always thought that the movie studios underestimates the public and insults our intelligence by endlessly churning out junk, but I have no idea that people like to have their intelligence insulted.",2,You'll Just Die If You Watch This Movie,1289433600,"11 11, 2010",2010,3419,"['not', 'die', 'laughing', 'have', 'recently', 're-discovered', 'original', 'movie', 'starring', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'have', 'heard', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'reactions', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'remake.The', 'remake', 'was', 'done', 'comedy', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'everybody', 'so', 'love', 'original', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'are', 'unfairly', 'comparing', 'remake', 'original.So', 'watched', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'started', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'character', 'name', 'only', ""n't"", 'take', 'pictures', 'anymore', 'here', 'have', 'knack', 'creating', 'reality', 'shows', 'specializing', 'emasculation', 'humiliation', 'male', 'gender', 'When', 'one', 'victims', 'shows', 'went', 'ballistic', 'public', 'Kidman', 'character', 'was', 'fired', 'resultant', 'fallout', 'damage', 'control.She', 'mild', 'house', 'husband', 'packed', 'up', 'leave', 'quaint', 'town', 'Stepford', 'when', 'everything', 'movie', 'just', 'went', 'down', 'hill.Filmed', 'comedy', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'fact', 'included', 'gay', 'couple', 'straight', 'acting', 'Republican', 'flamboyant', 'flaming', 'significant', 'other', 'are', 'classic', 'lines', 'delivery', ""'d"", 'just', 'die', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'recipe', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'jokes', 'funny', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'comic', 'timing', 'delivery', 'scene', 'where', 'wives', 'are', 'singing', 'Christmas', 'songs', 'camera', 'panning', 'see', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'sitting', 'idly', 'nearby', 'wearing', 'reindeer', 'antler', 'just', ""n't"", 'clever', 'funny', 'even', 'case', 'lot', 'reviwer', 'pointed', 'out', 'huge', 'plot', 'hole', 'here', 'wives', 'have', 'been', 'addressed', 'various', 'characters', 'being', 'robots', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'speaking', 'film', 'decided', 'change', 'plot', 'halfway', 'in.And', 'speaking', 'plot', 'changing', 'thing', 'dislike', 'movie', 'lamented', 'movie', 'nowadays', 'explained', 'everything', 'force', 'feed', 'audience', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'cake', 'when', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'stumbled', 'film', 'featuring', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'explaining', 'away', 'how', 'wives', 'are', 'transformed', 'cyberbetic', 'implants', 'brains', 'la', 'Borgs', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'filmed', 'major', 'revisions', 'was', 'done', 'script', 'was', 'shoehorned', 'film', 'end', 'real', 'villain', 'piece', 'revealed', 'too', 'gave', 'long', 'rambling', 'speech', 'who', 'how', 'why', 'was', 'trying', 'convert', 'people', 'robots', '.In', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'disgusted', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'checking', 'extras', 'heard', 'included', 'deleted', 'scene', 'where', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'became', 'anthropomorphic', 'vaccum', 'cleaner.The', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'somehow', 'execution', 'failed', 'major', 'catastrophic', 'way', 'squandering', 'talents', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'am', 'quite', 'surprised', 'sizable', 'number', 'reviewers', 'would', 'dare', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'rating', 'suspect', 'IQ', 'level', 'America', 'dropping', 'definite', 'sign', 'always', 'thought', 'movie', 'studios', 'public', 'insults', 'intelligence', 'endlessly', 'churning', 'out', 'junk', 'have', 'idea', 'people', 'have', 'intelligence', 'insulted']",N/A

Ever since ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Hours,"" people have been gushing about how glamorous and great Kidman is.  Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but if it weren't for Tom Cruise, we probably would have never heard of her.  Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed her in ""The Others,"" but none of her other movies have ever made me breathless or cry.""The Stepford Wives"" is no exception.  First of all, Kidman's character is presented as a total ice queen hellbent on destroying other people's lives on television to make a quick buck.  One of her victims gets crazy on his wife and some of her new boyfriends as a result of the show and the network cuts Kidman loose.  She has a breakdown and she and her loyal husband(Matthew Broderick) move to the beautiful little community of Stepford in order to recuperate.Right off the bat, Kidman starts to notice how the wives of this community are way too perfect.  They are all gorgeous, loyal to their husbands and children, and have hobbies like knitting and baking(except for Bette Midler and a gay man, who haven't been turned yet).  The men of the community hang out at a men's club on a hill in the town.  The men begin to court Broderick's character right away.  Kidman, Midler, and the gay guy start snooping around to see just what the heck is going on.From there, the story completely falls apart.  Midler and the gay guy(who's actually the funniest part of the movie) are turned into ""perfect"" spouses(or life partners).  Kidman catches on to the ""horrible"" acts happening in Stepford, but she might be too late to save even herself.The rest of the movie is bland and boring.  With the exception of the gay guy, the movie just isn't funny.  Glenn Close and Christopher Walken are the flagship couple of the perfect little community.  It is ashame that two fine actors as themselves are wasted in this trash.  John Lovett also appears in this flick as Midler's loser husband.  In all, there are some really good actors and actresses in this movie, but it's just horrible.  Faith Hill was splashed all over the country for being in this flick.  The result is that she is nothing but eye-candy.  Unfortunately, that's probably the only reason they put her in here(unless the producers were going for the pop-country audience).So, I hate to tear a movie apart like this, but I feel that I have to.  I've seen very few movies as dull or boring as this one.  The acting is bad, comedy is almost non-existent, and the ending is goofy.

848173,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002W4UDE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","If you are going to remake ""The Stepford Wives"" then I agree that it has to be done as a black comedy instead of taking another stab at making a horror film with a touch of social satire.  After all, the cat is out of the bag as to why the ""perfect"" women of Stepford are the way that they are, so there is no reason for the script by Paul Rudnick (""Addams Family Values"") to keep the characters in the dark when the audience already knows surprise.  So when Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) moves to the town of Stepford and her husband, Walter Kresby (Matthew Broderick) starts enjoying cigars and brandies at the Men's Association, we know most of what is coming, albeit with a series of twists appropriate to the new millennium.However, there is a fatal flaw to this updated version.  Granted, you have to take the science in ""The Stepford Wives"" with large measure of the willing suspension of disbelief, but for some reason that is beyond the understanding of mere mortals this film cannot decide what the secret science happens to be in this case.  We are thinking robots before the movie starts, we are thinking when some of the Stepford wives act like robots, and we are pretty much thinking robots right until a short education films provides a different explanation for the creation of the Stepford Wives.  Without giving away too much of a movie that presumes it has given a lot away in the first place, the robot science versus the non-robot science are incompatible.  When you watched the deleted scenes on the DVD this becomes even more obvious.  Apparently Rudnick and director Frank Oz got to a point where they had to choose which way to go and they tried to have it both wives.This is not to say that there are not some wonderful satirical skewers delivered verbal by Rudnick and visually by Oz.  Both AOL and Connecticut get knocked out by choice one-liners.  But the house of cards being constructed here just has too many severe structural problems.  For example, it seems that the wives of Stepford are not just women infected with first-stage feminism (Katharine Ross's Joanna in the original wanted to be a photographer, whereas Kidman's Joanna was a network programmer), but they are feminist amazons, who had been CEO's, judges, and brain surgeons.  As this Joanna admits, she had wanted to be a castrating, Manhattan career bitch dressed all in black ever since she was a little girl.  The complaint of the men in the Stepford Men's Association is that they were turned into women as they supported their wives, and is at that point that this movie went off the tracks for me.Riddle me this, boys and girls: If the women were all rich and successful, then THEY were the ones who had the money that BOUGHT the houses.  Even if, for the sake of argument, we say that all of these women have golden parachutes, what on earth would make them all decide to move to Stepford?  Once the husbands have their picture perfect wives, what will they do for money?  I am perfectly willing to admit I am over thinking this one, and I have proven in the past to put up with lots of nonsense in movies for the sake of narrative completeness, but since they messed by on the science part of the equation here they have used up their available credit for the rest of the film as well.Still, this new version of ""The Stepford Wives"" is worth checking out, whether you have seen the original or not.  I think you should see the original first, simply because you can appreciate some of the little twists that given particular scenes and characters.  Besides, the cast is not to be faulted for the script problems.  Kidman knows how to invest luminosity with a touch of lunacy, Broderick does a nice little twist on his good guy character, and you have Bette Midler, Glenn Close, and best of all Christopher Walken providing one of his patented performances, so we are not cheated on that score.  It is just that a script that shows this much wit should show the same sort of intelligence when it comes to the basic story premises as well.",3,A return visit to the wives of Stepford as a black comedy,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,4045,"['are', 'going', 'remake', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'then', 'agree', 'be', 'done', 'black', 'comedy', 'instead', 'taking', 'stab', 'making', 'horror', 'film', 'touch', 'social', 'satire', 'cat', 'bag', 'why', 'perfect', 'women', 'Stepford', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'reason', 'script', 'Paul', 'Rudnick', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Values', 'keep', 'characters', 'dark', 'when', 'audience', 'already', 'surprise', 'So', 'when', 'Joanna', 'Eberhart', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'town', 'Stepford', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Kresby', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'enjoying', 'cigars', 'brandies', 'Men', 'Association', 'know', 'most', 'what', 'coming', 'series', 'twists', 'appropriate', 'new', 'millennium.However', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'updated', 'version', 'Granted', 'have', 'take', 'science', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'large', 'measure', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'reason', 'understanding', 'mere', 'mortals', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'what', 'secret', 'science', 'be', 'case', 'are', 'thinking', 'robots', 'movie', 'are', 'thinking', 'when', 'Stepford', 'act', 'robots', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'thinking', 'robots', 'right', 'short', 'education', 'films', 'different', 'explanation', 'creation', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'given', 'lot', 'away', 'first', 'place', 'robot', 'science', 'non-robot', 'science', 'are', 'incompatible', 'When', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'Apparently', 'Rudnick', 'director', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'choose', 'way', 'go', 'tried', 'have', 'wives.This', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'wonderful', 'satirical', 'skewers', 'delivered', 'verbal', 'Rudnick', 'visually', 'Oz', 'AOL', 'Connecticut', 'get', 'knocked', 'out', 'choice', 'one-liners', 'house', 'cards', 'being', 'constructed', 'here', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'severe', 'structural', 'problems', 'example', 'wives', 'Stepford', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'women', 'infected', 'first-stage', 'feminism', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'Joanna', 'original', 'wanted', 'be', 'photographer', 'Kidman', 'Joanna', 'was', 'network', 'programmer', 'are', 'feminist', 'amazons', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'CEO', 'judges', 'brain', 'surgeons', 'Joanna', 'had', 'wanted', 'be', 'castrating', 'Manhattan', 'career', 'bitch', 'dressed', 'black', 'ever', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'complaint', 'men', 'Stepford', 'Men', 'Association', 'were', 'turned', 'women', 'supported', 'wives', 'point', 'movie', 'went', 'tracks', 'me.Riddle', 'girls', 'women', 'were', 'rich', 'successful', 'then', 'THEY', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'had', 'money', 'BOUGHT', 'houses', 'Even', 'sake', 'argument', 'say', 'women', 'have', 'golden', 'parachutes', 'what', 'earth', 'would', 'make', 'decide', 'move', 'Stepford', 'Once', 'husbands', 'have', 'picture', 'perfect', 'wives', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'money', 'am', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'admit', 'am', 'thinking', 'one', 'have', 'proven', 'past', 'put', 'up', 'lots', 'nonsense', 'movies', 'sake', 'narrative', 'completeness', 'messed', 'science', 'part', 'equation', 'here', 'have', 'used', 'up', 'available', 'credit', 'rest', 'film', 'well.Still', 'new', 'version', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'not', 'think', 'should', 'see', 'original', 'first', 'simply', 'can', 'appreciate', 'little', 'twists', 'given', 'particular', 'scenes', 'characters', 'cast', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'script', 'problems', 'Kidman', 'how', 'invest', 'luminosity', 'touch', 'lunacy', 'Broderick', 'nice', 'little', 'twist', 'good', 'guy', 'character', 'have', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'best', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'providing', 'one', 'patented', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'cheated', 'score', 'just', 'script', 'much', 'wit', 'should', 'show', 'same', 'sort', 'intelligence', 'when', 'basic', 'story', 'premises', 'as', 'well']",N/A

848178,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0002W4UDE,Lleu Christopher,"[3, 6]","It seems to me that if you are going to remake a film, there should be a good reason. Either it should be an improvement on the original or at least have something new to say. The remake of The Stepford Wives, directed by Frank Oz, does not fulfill either of these requirements. One problem is that the film cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be a lighthearted farce or a dark social satire and doesn't really work as either. Nicole Kidman is Joanna, a cynical producer of reality television shows (which are lampooned in an over-the-top manner). When she survives an assassination attempt but is fired from the network, she and her nerdy husband (Matthew Broderick) retreat to the idyllic Connecticut community of Stepford. I assume that most people know the basic premise, so I don't think it's much of a spoiler to mention that the wives of Stepford have been transformed into obedient robots to satisfy their husbands' every whim. Christopher Walken, as usual, has a sinister role as the head of the community.The overall mood of The Stepford Wives is light, with Bette Midler as her usual feisty self as another recent addition to Stepford who doesn't fit in. ""Fitting in"" as a Stepford wife means dressing and behaving like a caricature of a 1950s sitcom housewife. This is a central feature of the film that had a lot more impact in the original, if only because that was thirty years ago. The Stepford wives in this film are beyond parody --the way they dress, speak and focus on household chores is simply not believable. Even if we accept the premise of the film, if someone was going to program modern day housewives, they would at least make them more up to date in superficial ways.As the beginning of the film suggests (though not very well in my opinion), there is plenty to satirize about life today. Today's Stepford Wives would be latte-sipping, cell phone-toting soccer moms. But the film doesn't want to make fun of something real and contemporary --for fear of offending its intended audience? After the opening parody on reality TV, the film plays it safe and retreats back into the mythic 50s, which have already been parodied to death by other films. It is all too easy to make fun of what almost no one actually believes in anymore, and this undercuts any pretensions the film has to being serious social commentary. Of course, much of it is done in a light, slapstick mode, but this doesn't jibe with the heaviness of the basic theme. When it comes down to it, stealing peoples' identities and replacing them with a computer chip is not a light theme. There are even some basic holes in the technology premise of Stepford Wives, as some other reviews have pointed out. In most of the film, the wives are real women who have been implanted with a computer program, but in several scenes they are portrayed as actual robots. This is apparently something that was not reconciled in the final draft of the script. This is a fairly significant flaw in a story with a sci-fi premise, and indicative of the lack of thought that went into the film as a whole. Stick with the original. If you want something more up to date, the current television series Desperate Housewives is a much sharper and funnier satire on suburban housewives.",2,Weak remake of 70s film,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,3262,"['are', 'going', 'remake', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'reason', 'should', 'be', 'improvement', 'original', 'least', 'have', 'something', 'new', 'say', 'remake', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'not', 'fulfill', 'requirements', 'One', 'problem', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'be', 'lighthearted', 'farce', 'dark', 'social', 'satire', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Joanna', 'cynical', 'producer', 'reality', 'television', 'shows', 'are', 'lampooned', 'over-the-top', 'manner', 'When', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'fired', 'network', 'nerdy', 'husband', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'retreat', 'idyllic', 'Connecticut', 'community', 'Stepford', 'assume', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'basic', 'premise', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'spoiler', 'mention', 'wives', 'Stepford', 'have', 'been', 'transformed', 'obedient', 'robots', 'satisfy', 'husbands', 'whim', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'usual', 'sinister', 'role', 'head', 'community.The', 'overall', 'mood', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'light', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'usual', 'feisty', 'self', 'recent', 'addition', 'Stepford', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Fitting', 'Stepford', 'wife', 'dressing', 'behaving', 'caricature', '1950s', 'sitcom', 'housewife', 'central', 'feature', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'impact', 'original', 'only', 'was', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'Stepford', 'film', 'are', 'parody', 'way', 'dress', 'speak', 'focus', 'household', 'chores', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'Even', 'accept', 'premise', 'film', 'someone', 'was', 'going', 'program', 'modern', 'day', 'housewives', 'would', 'least', 'make', 'more', 'up', 'date', 'superficial', 'ways.As', 'beginning', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'opinion', 'plenty', 'satirize', 'life', 'today', 'Today', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'would', 'be', 'latte-sipping', 'cell', 'phone-toting', 'soccer', 'moms', 'film', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'fun', 'something', 'real', 'contemporary', 'fear', 'offending', 'intended', 'audience', 'opening', 'parody', 'reality', 'TV', 'film', 'safe', 'retreats', 'back', 'mythic', '50s', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'parodied', 'death', 'other', 'films', 'too', 'easy', 'make', 'fun', 'what', 'almost', 'one', 'actually', 'anymore', 'pretensions', 'film', 'being', 'serious', 'social', 'commentary', 'course', 'much', 'done', 'light', 'slapstick', 'mode', ""n't"", 'jibe', 'heaviness', 'basic', 'theme', 'When', 'down', 'stealing', 'peoples', 'identities', 'replacing', 'computer', 'chip', 'not', 'light', 'theme', 'are', 'even', 'basic', 'holes', 'technology', 'premise', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'most', 'film', 'wives', 'are', 'real', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'implanted', 'computer', 'program', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'portrayed', 'actual', 'robots', 'apparently', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'reconciled', 'final', 'draft', 'script', 'fairly', 'significant', 'flaw', 'story', 'sci-fi', 'premise', 'indicative', 'lack', 'thought', 'went', 'film', 'whole', 'Stick', 'original', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'date', 'current', 'television', 'series', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'much', 'sharper', 'funnier', 'satire', 'suburban', 'housewives']",N/A

The original version was a drama, with real people and real tension, set in a real world. I cared about the main character. This version was a comedy, with cartoon people in a fake world. I didn't care about the main character. In fact, I wanted the main character to be turned into a robot, so Nicole Kidman could stop trying to act.In this version, I think director Frank Oz gave up on having a real movie, because he figured everyone knew about the robot twist, so there wouldn't be any suspense. The alternative was to make it a comedy. Which might have been a good idea, had there been any humor in the movie. Instead of a funny spoof, it was a hectic, self-conscious horrorshow. Nicole Kidman was morose one minute, manic the next. Matthew Broderick looked like he wanted to be put out of his misery.

The film was scary and original when first released in 1975 (based on a novel by Ira Levin). The remake was a bomb with a $90 million budget but ended up making only $59 million domestically. With an A-list cast it could have been great. It turned an interesting premise that made a huge impact in 1975 into a comedy/sci-fi film. The Stepford Wives remake was campy on the day of release (in 2004). This film is so odd it doesn't know what to do with itself. It thinks it's a comedy at times and more dramatic at other times. The casting of Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz is the first clue that this isn't going to work. Roger Bart (Hostel 2) is very annoying. Christopher Walken is great but not used properly (his ""global commercial"" was horrible) leaving only Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick who did a fairly good job. The film doesn't take itself seriously nor does it expect you to do so. Ultimately, it just doesn't work on any level. Since the novel is fairly short we come to the end of the first hour expecting new material. Unfortunately, the final battle and ending don't work story-wise and completely change the tone of the novel. Nowhere is the memorable soundtrack, suspense and paranoia of the original. The production was filled with fights, re-shoots and challenges of all kinds. Apparently director Frank Oz also had problems when filming The Score. The Stepford Wives doesn't seem to connect with Amazon reviewers either who give it a lowly 3 star rating.

But in this film Stepford is a community like a woman's vision of the ""Ultimate 'Hooters' for Men-With-LOOOOOTS-OF-Money"".It's pretty fun watching Glenn Close and Bette Midler and Nicole Kidman do their creepy smiley Betty Crocker routines - Bette and Nicole only have to do it for about a scene each.  There was also a smile of recognition seeing Christopher Walken haul out his ""psycho dude"" act again and Jon Lovitz as the lovable/sarcastic husband of Bette Midler.But the movie is all built on a single premise that perhaps needed skewering back in 1972 but to my tastes seemed hopelessly out of date.

848182,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0002W4UDE,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[1, 3]","The new Stepford Wives is everything a remake should be. It takes the plot of the original film and updates it, but doesn't try to duplicate the film itself. This is a different movie althogether, played for laughs, and surprisingly, it works. The feminist message in the brilliant 1975 original is very dated and this film knows it and uses it to its advantage. It also takes a stab at everything today, from how absurd reality television is to the ridiculous concept of ""the woman's place is in the home."" It shows how little has actually changed since the original novel and film were released but updates the story to fit into modern times, and make it something today's audience can relate to.I was skeptical when I heard the creepy 1975 thriller was going to be remade as a comedy, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Talk of how bad this movie is hit the internet months ago, and because of all the negativity surrounding it, I didn't know what to expect,  but I guess the reshoots really helped because I enjoyed the film. The preview audience I saw it with also ate it up. This is perhaps the funniest comedy to come out all year and, along with Saved!, one of the most biting satires in recent memory.Nicole Kidman and Mathew Broderick are both quite good, but the real standouts are Bette Midler, Glenn Close, and Roger Bart as the gay Stepford Wive, a brilliant and neccessary edition. It was nice to have Christopher Walken in the mix as well. He can liven up even the worst film, which shows what a great actor he is,  very versatile. He fit in perfectly with the brilliant ensemble cast. Faith Hill fans will be somewhat disappointed though, since she doesn't have a very big part. It's actually little more than a cameo, but she looks amazing and acts well in the few scenes she's in. She really didn't get a chance to stretch her acting chops, but I look forward to seeing her in many more films to find out what she's really capable of.The Stepford Wives was surprisingly hilarious, colorful, and a pure joy to watch. The characters are wonderful and the dialogue sparkles. Only a gay man could write such clever and funny dialogue and it shows.  Better Midler has some terrific one-liners. Her pinecone comment, which I cannot mention here or this review won't even go up, was the icing on the cake. I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard throughout.Hopefully people will give this film a chance. Much like Saved!, it deals with a very serious topic, but the tone throughout is light and fluffy. Many people will probably hate it, but that's the kind of controversy that makes a film fun. The only problem I had was what I think is a HUGE hole in the plot concerning the Stepford Wives and HOW their husbands change them. The ending just doesn't seem consistant with the beginning, but it's not a big deal, I just figured I'd mention it. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt it. Either way, the movie is so fun, most people probably won't notice. This is a light, fun summer film definitely worth checking out.

The original producers retain the rights to the material and stand to make another fortune, etc.Remakes have always been problematic for me. Was the original somehow deficient? Can a new version be better? Is there a dearth of originality in the movie industry?""The Stepford Wives"" is a remake of a fairly good horror thriller, which was released in 1975. Based on an okay novel by Ira Levin, it did very well at the boxoffice. Part of the reason it did so was that Levin penned the vastly superior novel ""Rosemary's Baby"", which was made into a truly classic movie in 1969. People were eager to see his next effort.The crux of the 1975 version was the revolt of men against the rise of feminism. The men in the movie were appalled that the women in their lives were becoming not just their equals, but their superiors. In the exclusive community of Stepford, Connecticut, hope was found. Someone found a way to turn these ambitious, dangerous women into docile playthings for the men.The plot of the new version, though heavily altered, still focuses on new residents, Joanna and Walter [Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick]. A high-powered NYC TV executive whose career has hit the skids, Joanna immediately notes how all the Stepford wives are so odd and robotic. Walter, ever envious of his wife's career, pretends not to notice.The remake tries to bridge the 30-year gap from the original by using satirical comedy rather than horror. For the first half of the movie, this works. In the second half, everything devolves into a nonsensical mess.As an example as to how `all over the map' this version is, there is a subplot involving a gay male couple. One guy lets his partner be turned into a ""Stepford"" wife. I've no doubt there is a message here, but what it is escapes me. How can a group of conservative men  accept a gay couple? If the object is to turn women into homemaking sex slaves, why turn a guy into this?The film sports three great actresses - Kidman, Glenn Close and Bette Midler. They are fun to watch, as always, but they are wasting their time here. Ironically, their talents are trashed in this effort, practically turning the stars themselves into ""Stepford Wives"".",3,Okay comedy remake of an okay 1975 thriller,1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,2277,"['movie', 'sequels', 'understand', 'public', 'loved', 'original', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'original', 'producers', 'retain', 'rights', 'material', 'stand', 'make', 'fortune', 'etc.Remakes', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'problematic', 'Was', 'original', 'somehow', 'deficient', 'Can', 'new', 'version', 'be', 'better', 'there', 'dearth', 'originality', 'movie', 'industry', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'remake', 'fairly', 'good', 'horror', 'thriller', 'was', 'released', '1975', 'Based', 'okay', 'novel', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'boxoffice', 'Part', 'reason', 'did', 'so', 'was', 'Levin', 'penned', 'vastly', 'superior', 'novel', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'was', 'made', 'truly', 'classic', 'movie', '1969', 'People', 'were', 'eager', 'see', 'next', 'effort.The', 'crux', '1975', 'version', 'was', 'revolt', 'men', 'rise', 'feminism', 'men', 'movie', 'were', 'appalled', 'women', 'lives', 'were', 'becoming', 'not', 'just', 'equals', 'superiors', 'exclusive', 'community', 'Stepford', 'Connecticut', 'hope', 'was', 'found', 'Someone', 'found', 'way', 'turn', 'ambitious', 'dangerous', 'women', 'docile', 'playthings', 'men.The', 'plot', 'new', 'version', 'heavily', 'altered', 'still', 'new', 'residents', 'Joanna', 'Walter', '[', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', ']', 'high-powered', 'NYC', 'TV', 'executive', 'career', 'hit', 'skids', 'Joanna', 'immediately', 'how', 'Stepford', 'wives', 'are', 'so', 'odd', 'robotic', 'Walter', 'ever', 'envious', 'wife', 'career', 'not', 'notice.The', 'remake', 'tries', 'bridge', '30-year', 'gap', 'original', 'using', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'rather', 'horror', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'everything', 'devolves', 'nonsensical', 'mess.As', 'example', 'how', 'map', 'version', 'subplot', 'involving', 'gay', 'male', 'couple', 'One', 'guy', 'partner', 'be', 'turned', 'Stepford', 'wife', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'message', 'here', 'what', 'escapes', 'How', 'can', 'group', 'conservative', 'men', 'accept', 'gay', 'couple', 'object', 'turn', 'women', 'homemaking', 'sex', 'slaves', 'why', 'turn', 'guy', 'film', 'sports', 'three', 'great', 'actresses', 'Kidman', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'always', 'are', 'wasting', 'time', 'here', 'Ironically', 'talents', 'are', 'trashed', 'effort', 'practically', 'turning', 'stars', 'Stepford', 'Wives']",N/A

Let's be honest: hearing that is never a good thing, and after watching the movie I can tell you exactly where those reshoots occurred (but to no avail): the film's atrocious final act. Which is kind of a bummer, considering that the movie, though silly, is funny and light enough to keep clipping along for quite a while. Nicole Kidman seems to be having fun playing Joanna Eberhard, a fired TV-exec who moves with her husband (Matthew Broderick), to the town of Stepfod. I won't get into the specifics of the plot because (a) I only feel like writing two paragraphs and (b) I'm sure my readers have seen it or already know...so let's talk Bette Midler. Frumpy, hilarious, and scene-stealing for nearly half of the movie, she's a complete gem. I loved her over-the-top character, the great one-liners she had, and loved her so much that I could forget the fact that Matthew Broderick acts like he has a stick up his ass. In fact, Midler's gleefully raunchy Bobbie Markowitz is the key to this film; when she undergoes her 'transformation' it just all goes to pot.Though I haven't seen the original film, a source tells me that it ends on a fittingly creepy note that I would have enjoyed seeing this one end on as well. In Ira Levin's novel, there is a powerful statement about what society is doing to women as a whole, and this movie could have pulled off driving the point home. Nevermind that. Writer Paul Rudnick tacks on a final scene that is so pointless, so utterly awful, I had to fight to stay in my seat. Out come multiple plot twists, Brodericks' wooden husband as a hero, and an ending that I had feared would occur. This movie is so uneven, jumping from great comedy to flat melodrama (just plug your ears when Kidman and Broderick discuss their marriage) to social commentary and to action that I couldn't decide which one would actually work for it.

The movie started out with promise with a bit of parody of reality shows and then it went down hill from there.You can tell they cut it up and changed it so much of the plot they couldn't even decide if they wanted the woman to turn out to be robots like in the original movie or brainwashed like the final product insists. Pick a plot and go with it.Did test audience, as reported, not like the murdering of the woman so they changed it? Did they not like the comedy elements mixed with the dark ending?

848189,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0002W4UDE,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 4]","For those of you who are not familiar with Brini Maxwell, she is a fictional homemaker (played by Ben Sander) on the Style Network since 2003 that loves pastels, is always cheerful and acts like a flashback to the 1950's/1960's.  Though it is unlikely that Brini Maxwell was an inspiration for the fictional women in the 2004 remake of the 1975 classic sci-fi/thriller/mystery film ""The Stepford Wives"", there are several striking similarities.  At the beginning of the film, Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) is a network TV exec that loses her job over her controversial television shows.  In an attempt to salvage their marriage, her husband Walter Kresby (Matthew Broderick) purchases a new, computerized home in the quiet and wealthy Connecticut subdivision of Stepford.  There, they meet the couple that created Stepford: Mike Wellington (Christopher Walken) and his all-too-perfect wife Claire (Glenn Close).  Other recent arrivals in Stepford include Dave and Bobbie Markowitz (Jon Lovitz and Bette Midler) and the gay couple of Roger Bannister (Roger Bart) and Jerry Harmon (David Marshall Grant).  As Joanna, Bobbie and Roger attempt to adjust to life in Stepford, they can't help but notice the odd, always bubbly & cheerful personalities of the women who live there.  Everything about the people in Stepford just seems a little too perfect, which encourages the trio to do a bit of investigating; but all of them have already been tagged to become part of Stepford's all-too-perfect ""Ozzie & Harriet"" world.  However, not everything goes quite as planned.The world created in the 2004 ""The Stepford Wives"" by director Frank Oz and screenplay writer Paul Rudnick was just a little too surreal to make the film's characters particularly engaging.  The original story, written by Ira Levin, was not originally intended to be a comedy.  Therefore, attempting to combine its mystery/thriller aspects with humor that is often dry and predictable, as well as with personalities that are too reminiscent of the aforementioned Brini Maxwell, just doesn't blend into something smooth.  Instead, the result is a lightweight story with many bumps along the way that drag the film down a lot.  At least the last 10 to 15 minutes of the film are quite funny, interesting and entertaining.  Consequently, the highest rating that I can give to the 2004 version of ""The Stepford Wives"" is only 3 out of 5 stars.  If you are more interested in the mystery/thriller aspects of the story, you should stick to the 1975 film version or Ira Levin's original book.",3,A Lightweight Stepford Combined with Brini Maxwell,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,2550,"['who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Brini', 'Maxwell', 'fictional', 'homemaker', 'played', 'Ben', 'Sander', 'Style', 'Network', '2003', 'pastels', 'always', 'cheerful', 'acts', 'flashback', ""1950's/1960"", 'unlikely', 'Brini', 'Maxwell', 'was', 'inspiration', 'fictional', 'women', '2004', 'remake', '1975', 'classic', 'sci-fi/thriller/mystery', 'film', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'are', 'several', 'striking', 'similarities', 'beginning', 'film', 'Joanna', 'Eberhart', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'network', 'TV', 'exec', 'job', 'controversial', 'television', 'shows', 'attempt', 'salvage', 'marriage', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Kresby', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'purchases', 'new', 'computerized', 'home', 'quiet', 'wealthy', 'Connecticut', 'subdivision', 'Stepford', 'meet', 'couple', 'created', 'Stepford', 'Mike', 'Wellington', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'all-too-perfect', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Other', 'recent', 'arrivals', 'Stepford', 'include', 'Dave', 'Bobbie', 'Markowitz', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'gay', 'couple', 'Roger', 'Bannister', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'Jerry', 'Harmon', 'David', 'Marshall', 'Grant', 'Joanna', 'Bobbie', 'Roger', 'attempt', 'adjust', 'life', 'Stepford', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'odd', 'always', 'bubbly', 'cheerful', 'personalities', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'Everything', 'people', 'Stepford', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'trio', 'do', 'bit', 'investigating', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'tagged', 'become', 'part', 'Stepford', 'all-too-perfect', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'world', 'However', 'not', 'everything', 'quite', 'planned.The', 'world', 'created', '2004', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'director', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Rudnick', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'surreal', 'make', 'film', 'characters', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'original', 'story', 'written', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'was', 'not', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'comedy', 'Therefore', 'attempting', 'combine', 'mystery/thriller', 'aspects', 'humor', 'often', 'dry', 'predictable', 'as', 'well', 'personalities', 'are', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'aforementioned', 'Brini', 'Maxwell', 'just', ""n't"", 'blend', 'something', 'smooth', 'Instead', 'result', 'lightweight', 'story', 'many', 'bumps', 'way', 'drag', 'film', 'down', 'lot', 'least', 'last', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'Consequently', 'highest', 'rating', 'can', 'give', '2004', 'version', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'only', '3', '5', 'stars', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'mystery/thriller', 'aspects', 'story', 'should', 'stick', '1975', 'film', 'version', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'original', 'book']",N/A

At that point, what it really looks and feels like is, is that about 10-15 minutes of the movie was lopped off in order to come in under an hour and a half; which is too bad, because up to then, ""The Stepford Wives"" really has a lot of interesting things to say about man-woman relationships and marriage in the new millennium.This new version even incorporates a fully accepted, by Stepford society, Gay couple: though one could argue that one of the partners is too gay to be true. Be that as it may, Bette Midler as a neo-hippy novelist (Bobbi Markowitz) and Nicole Kidman as a whacked out former major TV network President (Joanna Eberhart) are ironic and funny-as-hell.But what happens  of the way through?

Bringing it back in this unnecessary if somewhat entertaining sequel was a big mistake.  The original which ended unhappily ever after at the grocery store had a sense of dread and tragedy that this movie never fully accomplishes.  Yes, Glenn Close is marvelous in her Cruella deville like performance; yes, Nicole Kidman is quite good as Joanna; and yes, Matthew Broderick still looks like a teenager.  Where the movie really fails is that it doesn't want to commit to what the Stepford wives have REALLY become.  Are they robots?  Or are they just robotic, acting strangely because of the chips installed in their brains?  The whacked out ending with Broderick running around pushing buttons leads us to believe that the women are still human, but if that's the case, then how did a human become a walking ATM machine; why wasn't Bette Midler's hand fried when she put it on the stovetop; why was their a new ""body"" for Nicole when Matt's supposed to initiate her into her new Stepford wife role?  This lack of cohesiveness ultimately destroys the movie, and the ending is so over the top and ridiculous, one can only wonder what the screenwriter and director were trying to pull on its audience.

It's about a woman who loses a very high paying and powerful job heading a network and I take it she has a breakdown. Her and her family move to a weird place where women are so-called ""Perfect house wives"" (I guess if you like a bimbo with no intelligence) and it's discovered they're robots.Well, that's the first dumb thing of the movie. They say they are robots but, the process of how the women become the way they are is not robotic, it's more computer-chip brain-washing.The second half of the movie, or wherever one of the bimbos spews up $20 in $1 notes is where the script must have run out and they where writing it on the spot. The plot just goes down, down, down, down, down until the movie turns inside out and commits suicide on itself.Things don't make sense, the ending is dumb and the reasons are stupid. The thing that hurts the movie most is the fact that it starts off as a comedy, then almost goes into a suspense/horror kind of theme, then goes back to comedy, then thriller, but nothing makes it a full thriller or suspense movie, which is the way I think it should have gone (apparently like the original but I've never seen it)This movie I would highly recommend you give to students who wanna be film makers and show them why it is important to have a finished script before they start making it. Give it a good beginning, a middle and good ending, take some time, there is no rush.I agree with Nicole that it is a bad movie.

It even manages to insult homosexuals by reinforcing the stereotypes that they are all merely clothes-conscious interior designers who mince and lithp.Miraculously, the film does all of this without once exhibiting a sense of shame for holding such a low opinion of everyone except career women and lesbians.Glenn Close, who lights up the screen no matter what she does, is the only bright light in this film for the few moments she is onscreen. She should have known better than to lend her considerable name to a film so far beneath her talent, she has to look up to see the gutter.Underneath this poor excuse for a parody, Hollywood celebrates its own lifestyle, hoping we won't notice the disdain it has for the rest of America.

It was a remake of the original (which is almost never as good), and they thought it was ridiculously cheesy.  There are some parts where they are trying to hard, no question, but I liked it.  It was far from the greatest movie ever made, to be sure, but I liked some of the comments they made here and there.Joanna (played brilliantly by the wonderful Nicole Kidman) is a high powered TV executive whose reality TV show went bust and cost her a dream job.  After recoving from her breakdown and her shock treatments, she and her family move to a delightful, chipper little suburb of Connecticut by name of Stepford.  While they settle in, Joanna befriends Bobbie, a liberal cynical writer, and a sassy flamboyant gay man (who provided the best comic relief of them all).  Something is not right in this fair town, as the other women are all perfect sex kitten bimbos who are all happy and busy and wonderful.  Their husbands, a bunch of drooling nerds who Joanna's husband Walter joins at the men's club, are strange and adored by their beautiful wives.  Slowly but surely, things begin to shift.  The formerly flamboyant gay boyfriend turns into a stiff, Brooks Brothers suit wearing Repulican content to stand by his man's side as a more passive partner.  Bobbie, once Joanne's best ally, suddenly turns into a June Cleaver who is content to make the world as perfect as the other wives do.  Joanne panics.Once they inevitably take Joanne into their clutches at the men's club, she too becomes a Stepford wife.  But, here is where the movie takes a dive from the original.  They overthrow the mastermind of Mike (CHristopher Walkin) and free the other wives from the clutches of Stepfordization.  Only to find out that Glenn Close was the real mastermind of the plot.  And everyone lives happily ever after.Some of the comments made in this movie ring just as true today as they did 30 some years ago, but others are more modern things and full of the same contraditions we deal with today.  Men in general, despite how far we've come, want someone lesser than they are - education, career, job, and even the more personal things like attractiveness, confidence, personality, intelligence, and dare I say it height.  Power is sexy, but men are intimidated by a powerful woman.  I look back on all my old boyfriends, with a few notable exceptions they were all intimidated by me because I was braver, smarter, a harder worker, and simply better than they were.  And yet, there is also a strange want that maybe all of us have for a simplier time, where our roles were more clear and more defined.  But now, it's too crazy.  More than half of the married women I know are the bread winners in their households, and they have to balance career and family out of necessity rather than choice.  Now it's become a sign of prosperity if the woman doesn't have to work.  Isn't it ironic?  There wasn't all this talk about family values and quality time, it just was the way it was.  Women didn't have to be the aggressors, and men didn't have to be the nurturers.  Maybe it was a little easier back then, but it's forever changed.",3,I've been Stepfordized,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,3198,"['People', 'were', 'pretty', 'bent', 'shape', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'remake', 'original', 'almost', 'never', 'good', 'thought', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'cheesy', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'are', 'trying', 'hard', 'question', 'liked', 'was', 'far', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'be', 'sure', 'liked', 'comments', 'made', 'here', 'there.Joanna', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'wonderful', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'high', 'powered', 'TV', 'executive', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'went', 'bust', 'cost', 'dream', 'job', 'recoving', 'breakdown', 'shock', 'treatments', 'family', 'move', 'delightful', 'chipper', 'little', 'suburb', 'Connecticut', 'name', 'Stepford', 'settle', 'Joanna', 'Bobbie', 'liberal', 'cynical', 'writer', 'sassy', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'provided', 'best', 'comic', 'relief', 'Something', 'not', 'right', 'fair', 'town', 'other', 'women', 'are', 'perfect', 'sex', 'kitten', 'bimbos', 'who', 'are', 'happy', 'busy', 'wonderful', 'husbands', 'bunch', 'drooling', 'nerds', 'who', 'Joanna', 'husband', 'Walter', 'men', 'club', 'are', 'strange', 'adored', 'beautiful', 'wives', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'things', 'begin', 'shift', 'formerly', 'flamboyant', 'gay', 'boyfriend', 'stiff', 'Brooks', 'Brothers', 'suit', 'wearing', 'Repulican', 'content', 'stand', 'man', 'side', 'more', 'passive', 'partner', 'Bobbie', 'once', 'Joanne', 'best', 'ally', 'suddenly', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'who', 'content', 'make', 'world', 'as', 'perfect', 'other', 'wives', 'do', 'Joanne', 'panics.Once', 'inevitably', 'take', 'Joanne', 'clutches', 'men', 'club', 'too', 'Stepford', 'wife', 'here', 'where', 'movie', 'dive', 'original', 'overthrow', 'mastermind', 'Mike', 'CHristopher', 'Walkin', 'free', 'other', 'wives', 'clutches', 'Stepfordization', 'Only', 'find', 'out', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'was', 'real', 'mastermind', 'plot', 'everyone', 'lives', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Some', 'comments', 'made', 'movie', 'ring', 'just', 'true', 'today', 'did', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'others', 'are', 'more', 'modern', 'things', 'full', 'same', 'contraditions', 'deal', 'today', 'Men', 'general', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'want', 'someone', 'lesser', 'are', 'education', 'career', 'job', 'even', 'more', 'personal', 'things', 'attractiveness', 'confidence', 'personality', 'intelligence', 'dare', 'say', 'height', 'Power', 'sexy', 'men', 'are', 'intimidated', 'powerful', 'woman', 'look', 'back', 'old', 'boyfriends', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'were', 'intimidated', 'was', 'braver', 'smarter', 'harder', 'worker', 'simply', 'better', 'were', 'yet', 'also', 'strange', 'want', 'maybe', 'have', 'simplier', 'time', 'where', 'roles', 'were', 'more', 'clear', 'more', 'defined', 'now', 'too', 'crazy', 'More', 'half', 'married', 'women', 'know', 'are', 'bread', 'winners', 'households', 'have', 'balance', 'career', 'family', 'necessity', 'rather', 'choice', 'Now', 'become', 'sign', 'prosperity', 'woman', ""n't"", 'have', 'work', ""n't"", 'ironic', 'was', ""n't"", 'talk', 'family', 'values', 'quality', 'time', 'just', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'Women', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'aggressors', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'nurturers', 'Maybe', 'was', 'little', 'easier', 'back', 'then', 'forever', 'changed']",N/A

Perhaps, it's that reviewers did not understood that it was an adaptation of the original 1970s movie to the social, fiscal and political situation that the nation was (and is) undergoing. The superb cast included recognized artists as Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Bette Midler and Christopher Walken.The plot was updated to the 21st Century. Joanna, the most recognized TV celebrity of NY suffers an emotional crisis after one of their hosts portrayed on her Reality TV show shoots his wife, her six lovers and tries to kill Joanna on stage. After a series of electroshocks, she regains memory now living in the perfect town of Stepford.Even though Joanna finds the wives from Stepford somewhat unique, it is not until she meets Bobbie (Bette Milder) and Roger (Roger Bart) that the three decide on finding out the mystery of why these women are so perfect. Worth mentioning that Bobbie and Roger had also suffered of depression and moved to Stepford thinking it was the ideal and happy town. For the rest of the plot, rent the movie but watch it with an open mind and relate it to issues and situations that current social dogmas require people to undergo adaptation with.It's all a comedy and a critique of stagnation and current conventionalist trends that some people and communities decide to adopt in order to survive specific situations. After watching this movie, it was so easy for me to relate it to many processes and issues that were happening five years ago...Once I saw this 2004 adaptation, did watch the 1970 original movie for the first time. By all means, the remake is much better than the original. If you can understand that it has been three decades of evolution for society, you will enjoy the movie as much as I did. Remember, the original movie was a thriller but the 2004 remake is a comedy of critique to our society.BTW, Fate had it that Roger Bart would be acting again with Matthew Broderick a year later in the film version of Mel Brooke's musical The Producers where he plays the role of Carmen Ghia.

It would be one thing if the creators attempted to take it into a different direction, thus giving validity to this remake...Alas, no such luck here...They just go through the motions and expect everyone to ""oooh"" and ""aaah"" at a plot they think no one's ever heard of before at all...Who are they kidding?This is probably the most unfunny ""black comedy"" I've ever seen...And I use that term loosely, since there's really nothing ""black"" or ""dark"" about it at all; even though it wants you to believe that it indeed is...Don't fall for it...Do yourself a favor and just go watch the original 70's version which is much better than this thing could ever hope to be...It's lifeless, toothless and completely worthless...Don't waste your time...",1,The Crapford Wives...,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,1803,"['What', 'was', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'thinking', 'how', 'make', 'good', 'films', 'Dirty', 'Rotten', 'Scoundrels', 'anyone', 'how', 'did', 'misfire', 'so', 'horribly', 'thing', 'Actually', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'outcome', 'totally', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'remake', 'decent', 'film', 'yep', 'guessed', '70', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'having', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'What', 'needless', 'remakes', 'already', 'well-done', 'flicks', 'What', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remake', 'crappy', 'film', 'turn', 'true', 'success', 'story', 'Oh', 'would', 'actually', 'mean', 'be', 'good', 'Sorry', 'forgot', 'excellent', 'cast', 'tried', 'true', 'actors', 'would', 'naturally', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'bring', 'quality', 'mediocre', 'script', 'was', 'summoned', 'ridiculous', 'excuse', 'film', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'would', 'ususally', 'make', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'cast', 'Here', 'however', ""'re"", 'just', 'flopping', 'around', 'nice-looking', 'astonishingly', 'empty', 'rehash', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'already', 'visited', 'Where', 'novelty', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'creators', 'attempted', 'take', 'different', 'direction', 'thus', 'giving', 'validity', 'remake', 'Alas', 'such', 'luck', 'here', 'just', 'go', 'motions', 'expect', 'everyone', 'oooh', 'aaah', 'plot', 'think', 'one', 'ever', 'heard', 'before', 'Who', 'are', 'kidding', 'probably', 'most', 'unfunny', 'black', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'use', 'term', 'loosely', 'really', 'nothing', 'black', 'dark', 'even', 'believe', 'indeed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'Do', 'favor', 'just', 'go', 'watch', 'original', '70', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'thing', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'be', 'lifeless', 'toothless', 'completely', 'worthless', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",N/A

I don't know....while I agree with the slips in continuity, (the ATM wife, Midler's burning hand, Kidman's potential replacement, the Faith Hill character acting EXACTLY like a haywire robot early in the film,) at odds with the premise that computer chips are making the wives act like animated Barbie dolls rather than a complete cybernetic replacement, this IS a funny movie. The quips are good, the cinematography is excellent, and the little O. Henry at the end is a nice touch.Though it's loosely based on the original Ira Levin story and the 1975 film starring Katherine Ross, Paula Prentiss and Patrick O'Neal, a LOT of liberties are taken with it: There's a gay guy in the cast now; the villain isn't who you expect it to be; there's an ethnic angle brought in; the humor is much more rat-a-tat then in the original film, and the movie actually has a happy ending, unlike the original, which saw EVERY one of the women eventually made into automatons!Despite the obvious aforementioned continuity mistakes, it still entertains, however, there is no way I could give it more than three stars WITH said mistakes. Next time, Frankie, spend a little more time reshooting scenes and editing correctly to stay consistent! With film budgets the way they are these days, that shouldn't be TOO difficult....! That said, Kidman is good as Joanna Eberhart, Midler is good for a while as Bobbie Markowitz, Glenn Close apppropriately plastic and cheerful as Claire Wellington. Christopher Walken is Max Shrek again as Mike Wellington, uttering his trademark broad ""O's"" as usual. Why Faith Hill is even mentioned as BEING in the cast is beyond me...her only real scene is when she ""malfunctions"" during a square dance, (another mortal shot at the ""computer chip"" continuity, as she shoots sparks out, acting exactly like a robot on the fritz.)This movie is played for laughs from beginning to end, rather than as a nightmare scenario for feminists and a wish-dream for frightened men.

I loved Kidman and Midler's neurotic characterizations. A lot of the jokes/cuts were cheap but still worked in the context of a low comedy that was just fun and seemed not to pretend to be much more.Okay, sure, what a risk to remake an iconic serious ""horror"" film and social commentary like the original as a silly comedy!! Maybe it was a dumb idea, but I am glad they did it because I got a kick out of it. Yes it made no sense toward the end and could have been done much better in terms of logic, for example, one minute the women were robots and then they just have chips in their brains. ETC. That is just one thing of several that would beg for forgiveness if this film in any way pretended to be serious! Yes I would have liked tighter logic, but I would forgive anyway because there were some very cute scenes.So five stars means don't necessarily pass it up just because of all the  terrible reviews. Kidman and Midler are cute. The characterizations by the other big name actors are variably adequate. Including a gay man as one of the wives is goofy but adds interest. The digs related to the Big City of New York relative to Connecticut as a sort of cultural refuge may offend some  -- but hey, its the sort of stuff you might find in a goofy Woody Allen film and chuckle at.

One wife's hand burned without pain. One wife walked backward upstairs stiffly and robotly, and more incredible, one wife was also an ATM machine. Only robots are like that, right? But after I saw the ending, the truth was those women were still human beings. They had microchips implanted in their brains. After the microchips were dropped, they were instantly restored back to normal. I didn't question it at that moment yet. After seeing the reviews here, I realized it how illogic it was.However, I rather have happy ending than to watch an ending according to the original fiction people mentioned. I wouldn't want to watch the Stepford husbands killing their wives and replacing them with robots. That sounds very very stupid to me. Any normal husband wouldn't want to have a robot wife who has no human flesh and love. Why didn't they just make a robot maid instead of a robot wife? Maybe I should pick up the book to find out why.I still think the idea of putting the chips in the human brain is slightly smarter than turning them into robots. But overall I dislike the whole idea of turning wives to be robots or robots-like.

Sure, it is not the best movie of 2004 or even close to it, but the main point of watching any movie is to enjoy ourselves, and this movie was, at times quite funny, and definitely unlike any other movie that I have seen.Simply put, the story revolves around Joanna (Nicole Kidman), who loses her job, whose kids hate her and whose marriage with her husband, Walter (Matthew Broderick) is breaking up. To start a fresh new life, the whole family decides to move to suburbs. But something is not quite right there, and Joanna tries to get to the bottom of it.The main reason why I feel everyone is criticizing this movie so much is because of the cast involved. Come on, just because we have a cast of Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick and Glenn Close in this movie doesn't mean we need to expect another Oscar winning movie. Besides, I felt that the cast acted really well, all of them. Also, Frank Oz did a great job at directing this movie. Sure, I myself found the ending a little disappointing, mainly because I thought they ended it a little abruptly.

848216,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0002W4UDE,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[2, 4]","""The Stepford Wives"" is a creepy movie based on some men's fantasy of the perfect woman. The men of Stepford find happiness by turning their high profile wives into robots who love to cook and are sexually compliant. The problem with this movie is that it mocks the more traditional woman who enjoys cooking and wants to take care of her family. It also mocks Christians and there is one instance of taking Jesus' name in vain. Yes there is some base humor if you are into that. I found it cringe worthy.The reason I watched this movie is because recently a woman at the top reviewer's amazon forum implied that I was a Stepford wife presumably because I am currently happily married and like to cook. I also like to make my house a home. So trust me there is no insult greater than to call a woman a robot. Sure I make cupcakes now and then but I have a heart and soul and feel things deeply. Yes last week I made a chicken pot pie from scratch and I believe that the way to man's heart is through his stomach. I take pride in my cooking and love it when my husband compliments me on my cooking skills.So basically I found this movie a bit insulting and the ending was very dramatic and drawn out. I was not convinced that the main couple in the story was truly happy in the end. The man wanted things his wife obviously was not willing to give him. What is so wrong with trying to make a man happy? As long as you are happy too I see no problem with the situation.Also for what seemed like most of the movie Nicole Kidman had a look of horror on her face. And how did her character and her husband live in a house obviously worth millions when they were both not working. This movie has a lot of inconsistencies. I also thought this was more of a horror movie than a comedy.

848217,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B0002W4UDE,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[3, 3]","What were people expecting, I wonder, when this remake was announced?With Frank Oz at the helm, Glenn Close and Bette Midler providing the comic relief and Christopher Walken in the role of the Stepford Patriarch, could this movie ever have turned out as anything other than high camp?No, and you'd be stupid to even try to compare it to the excellent original.In and of itself, however, 'The Stepford Wives' is a solid, well-made sort of comedy that won't win any awards, won't change the face of film making as we know it, and certainly won't stay with people for very long. But what it does, it does well - gentle undemanding comedy with broadly-drawn characters and some really rather beautiful set-pieces to look at mean that, even though it's as predictable as Martha Stewart in a Kitchen, at least it's a very entertaining sort of movie.Nicole Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a high-powered career minded TV executive, who, after losing her job and having a subsequent breakdown, is ferried by 'loving' husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) to the town of Stepford, Connecticut, where she is aghast at the seeming chauvanistic conformity of the majority of the townswomen. Allying herself to her more normal contemporaries Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Midler) and Roger Bannister (Roger Bart), the trio begins to unravel something of the mystery behind a community headed by the mysterious Mike (Christopher Walken) and his ueber-perfect wife Claire Wellington (Glenn Close).Close turns in a really rather terrific performance here, full of high falsetto and trembling over-enunciation. As with the rest of the Stepfords, the all-important 'sinister' aspect is missing here, but in the final scenes of the movie she really shines, garnering more laughs with her closing speech than the rest ofthe cast does throughout the movie. Kidman and Midler are in preschool here, they deliver their lines and act their emotions with all the energy of a tired basset hound, but they do it so well you don't really notice the lack of creativity in the roles. Roger Bart turns in a formulaic, if likeable enough, performance as Stepford's First Gay 'Wife', and the chemistry between the cast, while not really important, is enough to be believable.The movie is beautifully shot, with major attention to detail in all of the Suburban settings - Oz and his team have gone to great lengths to provide a really rather sumptuous vision of the Gated Community of Stepford, and this is where the picture shines - sure, the dialogue may be mundane and the plot predictable, but the visuals are so pretty and well-suited to the piece that it's hard not to like the movie more. The Book Club, Day Spa and Town Picnic scenes are really rather good, and lend a real sense of professional gloss to this otherwise ordinary movie.And that's about it, really. Hollow, unsurprising and not very creative, 'The Stepford Wives' is also solid, well-made and, if you take it as a separate movie to the original, quite enjoyable.Recommended.",3,Lighter-than-Air Camp,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,3003,"['What', 'were', 'people', 'expecting', 'wonder', 'when', 'remake', 'was', 'announced', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'helm', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'providing', 'comic', 'relief', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'role', 'Stepford', 'Patriarch', 'could', 'movie', 'ever', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'anything', 'other', 'high', 'camp', 'No', ""'d"", 'be', 'stupid', 'even', 'try', 'compare', 'excellent', 'original.In', 'however', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'solid', 'well-made', 'sort', 'comedy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'face', 'film', 'making', 'know', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'people', 'very', 'long', 'what', 'well', 'gentle', 'undemanding', 'comedy', 'broadly-drawn', 'characters', 'really', 'rather', 'beautiful', 'set-pieces', 'look', 'mean', 'even', 'as', 'predictable', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'Kitchen', 'least', 'very', 'entertaining', 'sort', 'movie.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Joanna', 'Eberhart', 'high-powered', 'career', 'minded', 'TV', 'executive', 'who', 'losing', 'job', 'having', 'subsequent', 'breakdown', 'ferried', ""'loving"", 'husband', 'Walter', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'town', 'Stepford', 'Connecticut', 'where', 'aghast', 'seeming', 'chauvanistic', 'conformity', 'majority', 'townswomen', 'Allying', 'more', 'normal', 'contemporaries', 'Bobbie', 'Markowitz', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Roger', 'Bannister', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'trio', 'unravel', 'something', 'mystery', 'community', 'headed', 'mysterious', 'Mike', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'ueber-perfect', 'wife', 'Claire', 'Wellington', 'Glenn', 'Close', '.Close', 'turns', 'really', 'rather', 'terrific', 'performance', 'here', 'full', 'high', 'falsetto', 'trembling', 'over-enunciation', 'rest', 'Stepfords', 'all-important', ""'sinister"", 'aspect', 'missing', 'here', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'really', 'shines', 'garnering', 'more', 'laughs', 'closing', 'speech', 'rest', 'ofthe', 'cast', 'movie', 'Kidman', 'Midler', 'are', 'preschool', 'here', 'deliver', 'lines', 'act', 'emotions', 'energy', 'tired', 'basset', 'hound', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'lack', 'creativity', 'roles', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'formulaic', 'likeable', 'enough', 'performance', 'Stepford', 'First', 'Gay', ""'Wife"", 'chemistry', 'cast', 'not', 'really', 'important', 'enough', 'be', 'believable.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'major', 'attention', 'detail', 'Suburban', 'settings', 'Oz', 'team', 'have', 'gone', 'great', 'lengths', 'provide', 'really', 'rather', 'sumptuous', 'vision', 'Gated', 'Community', 'Stepford', 'where', 'picture', 'sure', 'dialogue', 'may', 'be', 'mundane', 'plot', 'predictable', 'visuals', 'are', 'so', 'pretty', 'well-suited', 'piece', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'more', 'Book', 'Club', 'Day', 'Spa', 'Town', 'Picnic', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'rather', 'good', 'lend', 'real', 'sense', 'professional', 'gloss', 'otherwise', 'ordinary', 'movie.And', 'really', 'Hollow', 'unsurprising', 'not', 'very', 'creative', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'also', 'solid', 'well-made', 'take', 'separate', 'movie', 'original', 'quite', 'enjoyable.Recommended']",N/A

This is just the kind of material that doesn't work as a light comedy, and this is very lightweight comedic material. Forgetting this is indeed very dark subject matter, this is like a woman-haters' version of the Ira Levin novel. The original film got it right when it knew to portray this story as a real dramatic horror film. And excuse me, only a stupid guy thinks the original film was not believable. Or of course, isn't comfortable with the harsh truth that a lot of men would rather their women be ""perfect"" than their normal selves.The original Stepford Wives film was perfect, yet the imbeciles behind this remake take all the substance out of the story, cheapen the jokes by exploiting the obvious, and just thinly and fakely present a straight-forward story of dwindling threads of power being taken away from wives. But it was never enough to just make a stupid joke at the expense of women, this movie then turns the women into robots by the end of the movie and treats it as though it's the funniest thing, forgetting that a woman has been murdered. It's a lose-lose situation without the understanding that what happens in this story is damn well horrifying and scary. The original film understood this and didn't compromise to make anyone feel comfortable. It didn't tell the viewers they CAN laugh because this might never happen... It was smart enough to start with, what if it could happen?It presented the true horror of what a great deal of husbands would do to their wives if at all possible. Not this movie. This movie seems to think there is a great deal of humor to be found in the ultimate screw-over of women, without using an ounce of intelligent or mature thought as to how it felt to the character in the original novel. Or how it feels to the countless women who deal with men trying to hold them back or keep them down every day. The men working on this movie may not have meant to do harm, and the women working on this film might have been clueless. But these are not acceptable excuses.This is an awful remake. And just because the Joanna of this movie once has a high-profile job, or the script cracks a joke or two at reality television, or there's ""equal treatment"" because a gay man is turned into a Stepford Wife too doesn't make this PC justification of this film's loathsome humor and cinematic values.

Cynics can no longer write off this title as a time-sensitive fad, and must instead acknowledge its continued urgency to American cultural and political life.  Because the fashions and home decorations are generally updated for today's audiences, it is easier for my and future generations to focus upon the storyline's relevance to our own lives.After she is fired from her network executive position and then suffers a nervous breakdown, Joanna Eberhard (Nicole Kidman)  and her family move to the idyllic town of Stepford Connecticut. Priding herself on independence and strength, Joanna is quickly horrified to learn that most of the town's female residents are unabashed throwbacks to the idealized version of the 1950s, and Mike Wellington (Christopher Walken) presides over a quasi-secret men's club while wife Claire exherts a parallel pull over most female residents. Joanna quickly bonds with fellow outcast Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Middler), a writer who has remained cynical about the hamlet AND retained liberation despite her own long-term Stepford residence.Contrasting with the earlier film (which arrived shortly after the stonewall rebellion and before GLBT Americans came out in today's numbers), this version has an openly gay couple in the town---Roger Banister (Roger Bart) and Jerry Harmon (David Marshall Grant) . The people of Stepford pride themselves on being robo-Republicans but they are also happy to be just open-minded enough to publicly acknowledge the long-term relationship (hardly a benign issue with same-sex marriage making headlines around the country). Alas, he too is headed for dire consequences---because he becomes one of the very few Log Cabin Republicans after his own transformation.Joanna's husband Walter Kresby (Matthew Broderick) appears visibly reluctant in his own right to claim the numerous privileges Stepford confers upon him specifically because of sex.  He is obviously charmed by the town, but eventually realizes that he had specifically fallen in love with Joanna because she was an independent person who could NEVER be the ""all American homemaker"".Well-placed jabs at infamous rightwing women activists (such as Phyllis Schafly and Beverly Lahaye) abound when the town finally wakes up and realizes who was REALLY responsible for programming all of the women into being airheads.  Not all women are victims of subordination because other women made a very public name for themselves ensuring that their gender either remains or returns to inequality. When the plan is explained, this same person becomes instantly transformed from the idealized norm to a desperate and psychotic shellYet, if men are really unwitting accomplices in this same caper, this critical scripting update also suggests they can be, should be, and are important partners in women's equality.  Women's liberation ultimately makes both genders happy and well-rounded members of society.  Conversely, women's restriction also prevents men from enjoying life.",5,This movie has remained relevant for my generation,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,3126,"['remake', '1975', 'blockbuster', 'based', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'book', 'plot', 'current', 'events', 'modern', 'plot', 'twists', 'Cynics', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'write', 'off', 'title', 'time-sensitive', 'fad', 'must', 'instead', 'acknowledge', 'continued', 'urgency', 'American', 'cultural', 'political', 'life', 'fashions', 'home', 'decorations', 'are', 'generally', 'updated', 'today', 'audiences', 'easier', 'future', 'generations', 'focus', 'storyline', 'relevance', 'own', 'lives.After', 'fired', 'network', 'executive', 'position', 'then', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Joanna', 'Eberhard', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'family', 'move', 'idyllic', 'town', 'Stepford', 'Connecticut', 'Priding', 'independence', 'strength', 'Joanna', 'quickly', 'horrified', 'learn', 'most', 'town', 'female', 'residents', 'are', 'unabashed', 'throwbacks', 'idealized', 'version', '1950s', 'Mike', 'Wellington', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'quasi-secret', 'men', 'club', 'wife', 'Claire', 'parallel', 'pull', 'most', 'female', 'residents', 'Joanna', 'quickly', 'bonds', 'fellow', 'outcast', 'Bobbie', 'Markowitz', 'Bette', 'Middler', 'writer', 'who', 'remained', 'cynical', 'hamlet', 'AND', 'retained', 'liberation', 'own', 'long-term', 'Stepford', 'residence.Contrasting', 'earlier', 'film', 'arrived', 'shortly', 'stonewall', 'rebellion', 'GLBT', 'Americans', 'came', 'out', 'today', 'numbers', 'version', 'openly', 'gay', 'couple', 'town', '-Roger', 'Banister', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'Jerry', 'Harmon', 'David', 'Marshall', 'Grant', 'people', 'Stepford', 'pride', 'being', 'robo-Republicans', 'are', 'also', 'happy', 'be', 'just', 'open-minded', 'enough', 'publicly', 'acknowledge', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'hardly', 'benign', 'issue', 'same-sex', 'marriage', 'making', 'headlines', 'country', 'Alas', 'too', 'headed', 'dire', 'consequences', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'Log', 'Cabin', 'Republicans', 'own', 'transformation.Joanna', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Kresby', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'visibly', 'reluctant', 'own', 'right', 'claim', 'numerous', 'privileges', 'Stepford', 'confers', 'specifically', 'sex', 'obviously', 'charmed', 'town', 'eventually', 'had', 'specifically', 'fallen', 'love', 'Joanna', 'was', 'independent', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'NEVER', 'be', 'American', 'homemaker', '.Well-placed', 'jabs', 'infamous', 'rightwing', 'women', 'activists', 'such', 'Phyllis', 'Schafly', 'Beverly', 'Lahaye', 'abound', 'when', 'town', 'finally', 'up', 'realizes', 'who', 'was', 'REALLY', 'responsible', 'programming', 'women', 'being', 'airheads', 'Not', 'women', 'are', 'victims', 'subordination', 'other', 'women', 'made', 'very', 'public', 'name', 'ensuring', 'gender', 'returns', 'inequality', 'When', 'plan', 'explained', 'same', 'person', 'instantly', 'transformed', 'idealized', 'norm', 'desperate', 'psychotic', 'shellYet', 'men', 'are', 'really', 'unwitting', 'accomplices', 'same', 'caper', 'critical', 'scripting', 'update', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'are', 'important', 'partners', 'women', 'equality', 'Women', 'liberation', 'ultimately', 'genders', 'happy', 'well-rounded', 'members', 'society', 'Conversely', 'women', 'restriction', 'also', 'men', 'enjoying', 'life']",N/A

Yet the middle and end begin to terribly fall apart- especially since in one scene they're saying one thing and then saying a completely other thing in another scene. Basically we're pulled along it seems to either the wives being robots like the old film says- and then we're told it was just really chips in their brain making them housewives?

848226,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002W4UDE,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","*1/2For its 21 Century movie incarnation, Ira Levin's classic feminist thriller ""The Stepford Wives"" has been re-imagined as a feel-good, slapstick comedy - a shift in tone that is, to put it mildly, a complete disaster for this story.  Bryan Forbes' wonderful 1975 movie version (starring Katherine Ross) included many comic scenes as well, but there the humor was pointed and dark, and provided a perfect counterpoint to the sinister thriller elements at the story`s core.  In this ""new and improved,"" ever-so-sunny edition of the Levin work, written by Paul Rudnick and directed by Frank Oz, the whole thing is played for laughs from the get-go, instantly robbing the story of its edge and diluting its delicious social commentary about a society in which women have literally become mindless robots responding to the commands of their misogynist husbands.  All we're left with, in the end, is a really bad, over-the-top comedy that wastes the talents of Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler and that tarnishes the memory of a good movie into the bargain.A pixie-haired Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a driven TV network executive who is fired when one of the man-hating programs she produces goes terribly awry.  Determined to become a more supportive wife and engaged mother, she allows her husband to cart the family off to a gated, crime-free, all-white, politically conservative (though, somehow, a gay couple is allowed to slip through) community in Connecticut known as Stepford, a 1950's throwback where all the wives are perfect little Susy Homemakers who dress in poofy, pastel-colored gingham dresses, maintain spotlessly clean and flawlessly decorated homes, smile constantly, and dutifully cater to each and every one of their husbands' whims and wishes.  Even though Joanna intends to make every effort to become the ideal wife that her understanding husband wants her to be, she soon begins to suspect that there may be a dark secret lurking beneath the impossibly perky dispositions of all the women in town.Although the plot here is virtually the same as it was in the 1975 film, this ""Stepford Wives"" has taken the entirely wrong approach to the Levin material.  Part of what made the earlier version so much fun was that we learned right along with Ross what was actually taking place in the town.  Her slow awakening to the truth was what provided the suspense so essential to making the tale frightening and compelling.  Here, however, the women are such ridiculous space cadets from the outset that any newcomer would have to be a complete idiot not to figure it all out the moment she hit town.  Moreover, as a comedy, the film falls miserably flat, going for the cheap and easy laugh at every opportunity.  And, of course, the movie lacks the courage to carry through with the earlier film's downbeat, defeatist ending, opting instead for an upbeat and ""clever"" surprise-twist finale that shows just how far filmmaking has fallen over the past 30 years.  (It also makes absolutely no sense in light of the scene where Midler puts her hand directly into the flame of a gas stove and suffers no burn - but then who expects coherence and consistency from a film this badly written and thought out?).  The irony is that the first version, while retaining the thriller elements of the story, was far more humorous and far more effective as a satire than this limp little remake could ever possibly hope to be.Perhaps, after this movie and ""Bewitched,"" Ms. Kidman should avoid appearing in any more comedies - or at least any more comedies based on decades-old cultural artifacts - for the foreseeable future.This dreadful, ill-fated version of ""The Stepford Wives"" leaves us with just one basic question: if you're not going to do a remake properly, why do it at all?",1,disastrous remake,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,3834,"['*1/2For', '21', 'Century', 'movie', 'incarnation', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'classic', 'feminist', 'thriller', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'been', 're-imagined', 'feel-good', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'shift', 'tone', 'put', 'mildly', 'complete', 'disaster', 'story', 'Bryan', 'Forbes', 'wonderful', '1975', 'movie', 'version', 'starring', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'included', 'many', 'comic', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'there', 'humor', 'was', 'pointed', 'dark', 'provided', 'perfect', 'counterpoint', 'sinister', 'thriller', 'elements', 'story', 's', 'core', 'new', 'improved', 'ever-so-sunny', 'edition', 'Levin', 'work', 'written', 'Paul', 'Rudnick', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'whole', 'thing', 'played', 'laughs', 'get-go', 'instantly', 'robbing', 'story', 'edge', 'diluting', 'delicious', 'social', 'commentary', 'society', 'women', 'have', 'literally', 'become', 'mindless', 'robots', 'responding', 'commands', 'misogynist', 'husbands', ""'re"", 'left', 'end', 'really', 'bad', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'talents', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'memory', 'good', 'movie', 'bargain.A', 'pixie-haired', 'Kidman', 'Joanna', 'Eberhart', 'driven', 'TV', 'network', 'executive', 'who', 'fired', 'when', 'one', 'man-hating', 'programs', 'terribly', 'awry', 'Determined', 'become', 'more', 'supportive', 'wife', 'engaged', 'mother', 'husband', 'cart', 'family', 'gated', 'crime-free', 'all-white', 'politically', 'conservative', 'somehow', 'gay', 'couple', 'allowed', 'slip', 'community', 'Connecticut', 'Stepford', '1950', 'throwback', 'where', 'wives', 'are', 'perfect', 'little', 'Susy', 'Homemakers', 'who', 'dress', 'poofy', 'pastel-colored', 'gingham', 'dresses', 'maintain', 'spotlessly', 'clean', 'flawlessly', 'decorated', 'homes', 'smile', 'constantly', 'dutifully', 'cater', 'one', 'husbands', 'whims', 'wishes', 'Even', 'Joanna', 'make', 'effort', 'become', 'ideal', 'wife', 'understanding', 'husband', 'be', 'soon', 'suspect', 'may', 'be', 'dark', 'secret', 'lurking', 'impossibly', 'perky', 'dispositions', 'women', 'plot', 'here', 'virtually', 'same', 'was', '1975', 'film', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'taken', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'approach', 'Levin', 'material', 'Part', 'what', 'made', 'earlier', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'was', 'learned', 'right', 'Ross', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'taking', 'place', 'town', 'slow', 'awakening', 'truth', 'was', 'what', 'provided', 'suspense', 'so', 'essential', 'making', 'tale', 'frightening', 'compelling', 'Here', 'however', 'women', 'are', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'space', 'cadets', 'outset', 'newcomer', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'complete', 'idiot', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'moment', 'hit', 'town', 'Moreover', 'comedy', 'film', 'miserably', 'flat', 'going', 'cheap', 'easy', 'laugh', 'opportunity', 'course', 'movie', 'courage', 'carry', 'earlier', 'film', 'downbeat', 'defeatist', 'ending', 'opting', 'instead', 'upbeat', 'clever', 'surprise-twist', 'finale', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'filmmaking', 'fallen', 'past', '30', 'years', 'also', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'light', 'scene', 'where', 'Midler', 'hand', 'directly', 'flame', 'gas', 'stove', 'burn', 'then', 'who', 'coherence', 'consistency', 'film', 'badly', 'written', 'thought', 'out', 'irony', 'first', 'version', 'retaining', 'thriller', 'elements', 'story', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'humorous', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'satire', 'limp', 'little', 'remake', 'could', 'ever', 'possibly', 'hope', 'be.Perhaps', 'movie', 'Bewitched', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'should', 'avoid', 'appearing', 'more', 'comedies', 'least', 'more', 'comedies', 'based', 'decades-old', 'cultural', 'artifacts', 'foreseeable', 'future.This', 'dreadful', 'ill-fated', 'version', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'just', 'one', 'basic', 'question', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'do', 'remake', 'properly', 'why', 'do']",N/A

With a cast that has this much talent, I at least expected to be entertained.The problems are significant and abundant.  You can start with the film itself.  In order to understand just how totally this movie misses you have to appreciate the original.  The original film's idea was to try and look at man's fear of the feminist movement and a woman's changing place in society as their independence grew.  This was the theme that the entire film was built around.Simply put, times are different today.  That's not to say that sexism doesn't exist, but the rapid-fire change and unrest that was present in late-sixties and seventies society just isn't present today.  To strip that theme of female empowerment away in the remake, leaves the film with no substance.  It's completely toothless and has nothing to say.On top of that, for whatever reason, Oz decided to remake this as a comedy and, frankly, it's just not funny.  Nor is it well acted, the normally talented director couldn't seem to mine anything out of his cast.

That's not to say the movie isn't funny - it often is. But did we need a stupidly lighthearted ""Stepford Wives"" remake? Absence of consequence is better left to ""Dodgeball"" or ""Bad Santa."" More serious issues - female empowerment, emasculation, the pressure on women to be thin, fun, successful and nuturing all in the next multitasked 20 minutes - are at hand today than they were 30 years ago. Rudnick, who penned the very funny ""In & Out"" for Kevin Kline years ago, is not up for a sharpened, caustic, honest take.Joanna Eberhard (Kidman) is a Lady MacBeth television exec bent on building her programming around reality shows that pits men and women against each other. When the participant of one of the shows (""I Can Do Better!"") loses it in public, Joanna's out of the network - and so is her husband, Walter (Broderick), who worked under Joanna. The ice queen has nervous breakdown and Walter takes the gang (including practically non-existant children) to Stepford, Connecticut, where the women are extremely - off. The golden-haired Mike (Walken) runs the town with a lizard's charm from the Men's Club atop the hill, and his wife, Claire (Glenn Close), is the local welcome wagon. Joanna finds only two kindred souls in the town: Jewish writer Bobbie (Bette Midler) and gay architect Roger (Roger Bart), who supplies most of the movie's best laughs as Rudnick's alter-ego, presumably.Kidman is better suited for comedy than she would seem; like her ex-husband, Tom Cruise - whom she seems the channel at times here - Kidman is best when given a boatload of gestures to take on, and she plays the terminally cynical Joanna with energy and pluck. She, Midler and Bart find an easy chemistry, while Close inhabits her tricky, ""Sunset Boulevard"" role with zeal. Rudnick has little success with the alpha male roles, however, and Broderick and Walken have rarely seemed so pasty. Broderick has subversion hard-wired into his acting. To render him obsolete says something.It's Rudnick's inabilty to erect two balanced sides of the gender debate that accounts for the film's weakness: It is a relentlessly liberal movie, with a twist on the Walken/Close relationship near the end meant to even the score slightly. It treats children as if they don't exist. Rudnick and director Frank Oz never quite figures out if the women are controlled by robots or microchips, and the movie treats its ""secret"" as if it needs to be closely held onto until the final reel.""The Stepford Wives"" has no real mystery.

The cast was impressive, and the novel by Ira Levin is excellent, so it was hard to believe that the movie could be that bad. I am sad to acknowledge that I was totally wrong; the script is absolutely dreadful, and the experience of watching this film is almost pure agony. The only aspect I think deserves praise is the performance of Bette Midler, who does as much as she can, considering the rest of the aspects of this movie. Midler is the only reason why I am giving this product two stars instead of one.Joanna Eberhart (Kidman) is one of the hardest-working people in the TV environment; she is at the top of her career and feels great about it. But during a company celebration, she is confronted by the ""star"" of one of the network's reality shows. He tries to shoot her and fails, but before his attempt he was successful in killing his wife and the five boyfriends she met during the show. The network, fearing a monumental lawsuit, decides to let Joanna go, condemning her to be a housewife.Walter (Broderick) is Joanna's husband, and was working below her in the same network at the time, but showing solidarity with his wife, resigns and decides to move to Stepford in order to start over. In this community everything is perfect, the gardens are immaculate, the pets are mechanic, the toilets flush automatically, and the women...Well, what can I say?

Throw in a superbly timed Glenn Close as an off-kilter uber-suburban housewife, or a Bette Midler as a wacky liberal torchbearer on the edge of losing it, and you'll be chuckling out loud.The Stepford Wives version 2.0 is eminently watchable (not quite a ""joke"" as one reviewer laments) and has a healthy tongue in cheek as it harks away on modern issues -- grasping corporations, technology gone berserk in pandering to conspicuous consumption, ball-busting women, and so forth.But thinking back, with such a riveting theme, it could have been a lot better. I remember it more as a smug short-of-breath narrative.The Big Ghastly Secret that the plot pivots around is not quite unknown to us, we have very little to fear and no mystery to solve. There are about six lead characters (even if Kidman is the spine) but there is insufficient examination of anyone's TRUE motives that could have made us care or identify more with them. The goings-on are far-fetched enough so more plot development would have gone a long way.All these antics/robotics culminate into a surprisingly perky climax that may whet your appetite for a marital happy-ever-after but teeters on the brink of incredibility.

Everyone is extremely Barbie-esque - perfect posture, perfect hair, perfect nails, perfect smiles, all while wearing back-breaking high-heel shoes.Walter finds it intriguing, but Joanna finds it creepy. She makes fast friends with author Roberta Markowitz (Bette Midler) and Roger Bannister (Roger Bart), new residents in Stepford. They skulk around trying to find what is making all the Stepford wives so peachy keen.Christopher Walken plays Mike Wellington, the Mayor of Stepford and president of the Men's Association - a testosterone-filled play-zone for middle-aged men with pot-bellies and comb-overs who long to bond without the baggage of whiny wives, only go go home to have a tidy house, home-cooked meals and a sexy blond wife who loves doin' the &quot;grown-up&quot; every single day. As always, Walken is both debonair and creepy.The film is ultimately more upbeat than the original it pays homage to, making the tongue-in-cheek moments that much more enjoyable.  Despite the improbable tale, new technical advances make some of the film more believable than it was in the 1975 version when simple computers were the size of gymnasiums.Nicole Kidman is fantastic and while the film is total fantasy, her character is ultimately ultra-believable.

The film can't decide what it wants to be, a vicious look at gender roles and modern expectations, and manipulations thereof, or a typical wacky, nutty, everyone-falls-down slapstick glopfest.  Well, the public would like both, so let's give it to them.  The result is this sad and sorry film.Other reviews have noted this, but I can't resist piling on--the flipping film doesn't even make sense.

In Forbes' film our heroine moves to the sleepy town of Stepford where everything seems just wonderful at first, only for a sense of mystery and dread to build up slowly as it gradually becomes clear that something is not quite right about the town's women. Oz throws that away by having the weirdness of the womenfolk grotesquely in our faces from the very start. Then in the Forbes original, once Joanna has figured out what is afoot, the film becomes a thriller as she tries desperately to escape sharing the fate of the town's other women. This too Oz throws away. There is no desperate pursuit. Kidman basically just quietly goes and places herself in the hands of the baddies. Having amputated all the mystery and suspense from the movie, Oz then tries to compensate by inserting some very lame humour with feeble comic turns from Bette Midler and Roger Bart as the other ""wives"" new to town. None of the other performances are much good either. Kidman is far from her best. Walken does his familiar sinister routine on autopilot and Glen Close delivers what must be one of the worst performances in the history of the cinema. By the time I got to the reprise of the supermarket sequence that was the end of the original movie I was hugely relieved as I was desperate for this dismal and tedious movie to end. No such luck, the movie didn't end there and there was another 20 minutes to go, comprising a truly asinine not to say incoherent new ending.

Maybe it's worth checking out, if for no other reason, than to see if the acting (and version of this story) was better. The performances in this movie were very stiff (sure, I know, at times it should be this way, considering the storyline, but I mean everyone was a bit stiff), and strange.It could've been really funny but unfortunately, it kind of misses the mark, and often, with lots of long pauses that I assume, are meant for laughter, but eh, those moments weren't so funny to me. Could've also been a little more scary. I found myself wondering why they explained some things and left other things just out there (apparently, I missed something). The whole movie is a bit disappointing considering the cast, though I did like Bette Midler and Christopher Walken in this.I can't recall seeing many commercials promoting this movie. Those available online didn't quite capture what the movie was about (tended to be misleading, which I guess isn't new).

848247,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B0002W4UDE,Thomas Glebe,"[4, 5]","This is a 30 years in the making rework of a mid 70's quirky and satirical original by the same name.  While no great fan of the first film, it was something new at the time, and hit with a lot more subtle impact than this shamefully bad remake.  The original also seemed to touch not only a comedic nerve but a socially conscious one, whereas this only scratches the surface.The main problem with this version are not the stars.  Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken, Bette Midler and others are all accomplished (elsewhere) and the editing, pace, music, and basic direction seem fine.  Technically, there are no major problems, and there is great costuming and set production. The big fault here is the script (writing), which is dull and tiresome as well as confusing and non-credible (even for a fantasy, sci-fi comedy).  And while the original seemed subtle and predictive, this seems out of topical place.  That is, this version seems to be unbelievably lacking in social comment of today's times.  Instead, the movie constantly uses symbols and icons from the mid 70's, which seems lazy when trying to remake something taking place 30 years later.For instance, Nicole Kidman's character is not believable in the beginning.  It is too over the top.  Here is where a more subtle approach would've worked wonders.  Matthew Broderick is cast as usual as the innocent, boy next door, quirky female hero, but we are supposed to believe he has had something going with Kidman's media corporate bitch from hell.  From the start then, as these two head off to a non-Manhattan, more peaceful and ""organic"" existence in Connecticut (where else?  Vermont perhaps?  Oregon?), the viewer already does not accept their characters as real, which eventually ruins everything else that follows.The key here is the concept of ""subtle.""  This version has none.  Instead of trying to dream up a modern day version of the days gone by ""suburb bliss"" of the 70's, this one opts instead for one back in the 50's.  While some may argue this was a general flaw in the original as well, in this one, we are now talking about 30 plus about 20 years, or more, and yet hip modern day hipsters like Kidman and Broderick can't see something wrong with the Stepford community they join?  It takes a whole movie for them to finally realize when they entered Stepford, they entered the Twilight Zone?While there are some semi-funny ideas here, but no real laughs, while the leads are all appealing, there are times when the viewer has to ask, when is this mess going to end?  And more importantly, when are the characters going to react to what they are experience the way actual ""normal"" not robotic folks might?Unfortunately, that only comes after many throw away scenes and ideas, all of which should've remained on the editing floor.  This seems like the worst of Hollywood Deal-Making 101.  Grab an old script or idea, rework it sprinkling a lot of celebrities, pay no real attention to the writing, include a lot of SHOULD'VE been deleted scenes and mix all together to make a quick buck for all, and you've got this.  A real waste of time for those who actually paid to see this in a theater, a decent enough actor wage, and a hope residuals (after net points) will be enough for all of those involved to make more crap like this in the future.If at all possible, rent before you buy.  Unless you might enjoy replaying this over and over again just to see how ""they"" make quick possible short term moneymakers out in Hollyweird these days.  But where's the fun in that?One topical note of interest, as the husbands and wives in the community of Stepford have the ability to do a lot with remote controls, it is gratifying at least that you the viewer have the opportunity to fast forward through this forgettable by the numbers sludge if you are misfortunate enough to having bought this without watching it first.Nicole and Matthew have and hopefully will see much better days.  Christopher Walken seems to be playing his Saturday Night Live ""Continental Man"" character.  Bette Midler, is wasted here.  This is a badly written script, that's all.  The original is much better, as it deals with its time period in a realistic manner.  This version adds a lot of high tech, but none of the characters are ever believable in the slightest.This movie should've been fun.  Instead, it winds up challenging the viewer to ever increasingly frustrating attempts at suspending belief to a point where any humor found in believable events is quickly dispatched, and is never heard from again, throughout.A real disappointment.  This could've been a great idea, if updated correctly.  Instead, it is the kind of movie where one is constantly asking ""WTF"" and so by the end, delivers nothing but the same, ultimately a real unpleasant experience.

The Stepford Wives is an histarical assemble cast including Nicole Kidman, Matthew Brodrick, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken, Jon Lovitz, & Glenn Close.  Great cameos throughout the film.  At the least its a well acted original movie based on the 1975 film of the same name(which I have not seen).The movie centers around Kidman's character who basically has a nervous collapse when she loses her high profile tv producer job.  Her & her husband (played by Matthew Broderic), move to Stepford to start a new life.  The audience catches on pretty quickly when we first arrive at Stepford, both because its so obvious, & the previews tell a lot.  It turns out Stepford is nothing more than a bunch of husbands who couldn't take there successful, career woman wifes, so they commute in a little town where a mad scientist, (played by Christopher Walkin), turns woman basically into robots that will do whatever there men want.Knockout performances by Kidman, & Bette Midler, who delivers the single funniest line in the film.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.  Got one star knocked off because i think this movie had another telling of the story that could have possibly been better.

If you have it, keep it, treasure it, and forget about anything about the new version of Ira Levine thriller, which is not only mediocre, but also, with this cast, a criminally unfunny and even offensive.Nicole Kidman is Jonanna, a (gross parody of) TV producer whose very misguided shows resulted in gunshots of a disgrunted husband Mike White.  Duely fired, she and her hubby Matthre Broderick finds a new home in a perfect town Stepford, Connecticut, where they are introduced to these happy wives and happy husbands (plus a happy robot dog).  Then, as you know, they see something is wrong with the kind townspeople when some of them act weirdly inspite of themselves.The film sounds like a horror, but the film director Frank Oz turned it into a dark comedy, or satire if you like, about ... about what?  You just don't see the film's point when the targeted ideas or lifestyles are no longer the things of the past, something you have seen in the TV series like 'Bewitched.'  And as to the satire about the 50s America, Julianne Moore in 'Far From Heaven' has done already.But the most awful part of the film is, I think, the acting.  OK, I don't know you, so excuse me if I offend, but Nicole Kidman here is no Nicole you have seen in 'The Others.'  Her overacting clearly invites us to laugh with her.  We rather prefer to laugh at her when every gesture and word misses the mark far wide, done with irritatingly exaggerated manners which are no fun to see.Other supports are no good either, perhaps with the exception of Robert Bart as her friend in town.  Bette Midler is as grating as 'Isn't She Great?'; Matthew Broderck has not made a good film since 'Election' and this one does not change the fact; Christopher Walken and Glenn Close as town's organizers are just lamentable, especially Oscar-nominee Close whose overacting reminds us of the outtakes of Cruella DeVille.  And she is not funny.I don't say everything is stale and unfunny -- some part of the film are mildly amusing -- but the entire film still does not know what it wants to do.

Marshall,"[0, 2]","This remake of a 1975 horror film is actually much more of a comedy but it carries tremendous punch directed at the heart of all the so called ""moral values"" of wealthy American families.Joanna (Nicole Kidman) begins this film as a real power hungry modern woman who runs her own network. Her husband (Matthew Broderick) seems happy to just surf behind her enormous wake while their children have everything but a real family to relate to. Upon losing her career, Joanna hits rock bottom and her husband sees a way to move the whole family to Connecticut in order to re-group and get happy. Meet Stepford, a charming and affluent town of plastic wealth where everything is just as perfect as can be and oh so morally correct......American suburbia explained. The town is filled with fixed smiles, happy but nerdy husbands, lots of lace and pastels and not a hair out of place, except for the husbands with comb-overs that is. From the outside such perfection is enticing but finally a film dares to show the reality of being a modern woman at the mercy of the American dream.....the idea fails but this movie soars!This film is directed by Frank Oz and he has done a really beautiful job with the scenes and coloring of this project. The funniest scenes are also the most heartbreaking exposing the realities of life behind all those perfect houses in the suburbs. Nicole Kidman is really good as the strong willed yet vulnerable Joanna. Broderick is the perfect nerdy but loyal husband with a desire for more control. Glenn Close is excellent as the main Stepford wife and her husband is played eerily by Christopher Walken. But by far the best couple in this film is Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz as the town's Jewish couple so far from perfect that they become infectiously endearing to anyone who can relate to reality.This movie leaves many socio-political stones upturned and vulnerable, mainly the idea that women must be extraordinarily beautiful, concentration camp thin yet extremely  well-endowed, proficient at baking a perfect cake, a fiend for boring sex and capable of being placed on mute by a remote or through a controlling man. Sadly I see these women everyday in the nearest grocery store with plastic smiles and botoked cheeks. Unlike the original, this film suggests that the blame lies in a nerdy husband's fear of being overshadowed by a powerful wife with her own opinions. If they can have remotes why can't we?

The only way they could have got an impressive array of stars to sign up was big bucks and perhaps a different script to what was used in the end.Stepford Wives cannot make up its mind whether it is a comedy, drama, suspense or whatever.

Her best works to date is in ""Dogville"", ""Bangkok Hilton"" and ""My Life"".  Did anyone else notice how extremely thin she looked in the film, almost waif like.

What a blessing.  We've all heard the rumours that there were troubles during filming, and this could mean that the cast did not like what was evolving during filming. Apparently an uncut longer version exists which makes the film a bit better, it may get released oneday.The best laugh on the DVD was the special features where the actors convincingly tell us how much they enjoyed doing it (eg. Nicole says ""this was a welcome relief to make after filming BIRTH).  Yeah, right.  Still, if you were paid $15m for doing a crap film,  you are going to say good things to promote it.

And it's a shame too because this could of been a great remake considering it's A-List cast.I don't think I really have to go too much into the plot since I'm sure most people, even ones who haven't seen any of the various films or even read the book, would know already. So I'll just give it to you in a nutshell. Basically Nicole Kidman's character Joanna moves from the city with her family to the suburban gated community of Stepford, Connecticut. Everything is perfect. Perfect houses, perfect lawns, and perfect wives. But there is something eerily strange about the women of Stepford and soon Joanna finds out the disturbing truth about Stepford.Now, the original film was fantastic. It was full of suspense and enough creepiness to make your skin crawl. Even the ending, as dark as it may be, was something that was talked about and still is. So it's obvious to say that THE STEPFORD WIVES (1975) was going more into the direction of horror. The director of the remake, Frank Oz, decided to flip that and turn it into more of a comedy which sounds great because the film could be interpreted either way. But for some reason something went wrong and the resulting film has suffered terribly for it. Also, (Spoiler warning: although who really cares) the plot of whether the wives were killed and replaced with robots or brainwashed is so muddled that by the end of the film you find yourself confused. ""If they weren't robots then why the sparks?"" or ""How did her breasts enlarge if all she had were a few chips in her head?"" Yes the plot is a complete mess and I can't help but feel very sorry for the people involved because they turned something that could of been great with the advanced technology into something that wasn't.",2,A LOT of assembly required!,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,1988,"['Based', 'book', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'original', '1975', 'film', 'THE', 'STEPFORD', 'WIVES', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Glen', 'Close', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'fine', 'actors', 'actresses', 'unfortunately', 'none', 'could', 'save', 'film', 'shame', 'too', 'could', 'been', 'great', 'remake', 'considering', 'A-List', 'cast.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'have', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'plot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'various', 'films', 'even', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'know', 'already', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'give', 'nutshell', 'Basically', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'Joanna', 'city', 'family', 'suburban', 'gated', 'community', 'Stepford', 'Connecticut', 'Everything', 'perfect', 'Perfect', 'houses', 'perfect', 'lawns', 'perfect', 'wives', 'something', 'eerily', 'strange', 'women', 'Stepford', 'soon', 'Joanna', 'out', 'disturbing', 'truth', 'Stepford.Now', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'fantastic', 'was', 'full', 'suspense', 'enough', 'creepiness', 'make', 'skin', 'crawl', 'Even', 'ending', 'as', 'dark', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'talked', 'still', 'obvious', 'say', 'STEPFORD', 'WIVES', '1975', 'was', 'going', 'more', 'direction', 'horror', 'director', 'remake', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'decided', 'flip', 'turn', 'more', 'comedy', 'great', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'interpreted', 'way', 'reason', 'something', 'went', 'wrong', 'resulting', 'film', 'suffered', 'terribly', 'Also', 'Spoiler', 'warning', 'who', 'really', 'plot', 'wives', 'were', 'killed', 'replaced', 'robots', 'brainwashed', 'so', 'muddled', 'end', 'film', 'find', 'confused', 'were', ""n't"", 'robots', 'then', 'why', 'sparks', 'How', 'did', 'breasts', 'enlarge', 'had', 'were', 'few', 'chips', 'head', 'plot', 'complete', 'mess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'very', 'sorry', 'people', 'involved', 'turned', 'something', 'could', 'been', 'great', 'advanced', 'technology', 'something', 'was', ""n't""]",N/A

Glenn Close goes over the top in her grinning, insidious character, much like her 101 Dalmations role. Bette Midler does most of the work of keeping this story a comedy. Her Stepford transformation may be the one funniest moment of the movie. Christopher Walken plays the psychopathic male lead (as usual), but without the pert veneer that keeps cracking over Close's character.The movie launches a few well-placed jabs at TV, at so many men's idea of the perfect spouse, and at the men who really want June Cleaver as a wife. Perhaps the gay men in this movie best illustrate the idiocy of that 1950s ideal. Sanity, or at least a modicum of respect wins out in the end, in keeping with the movie's light tone.Still, there's that implicit, off-screen violation or violence that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's just me, I know, but I find that it pervades the movie like an ugly smell. It really interferes with my ability to accept this as the comedy it's meant to be.

In &#34;The Stepford Wives&#34;, a great kernel of a story is turned into almost a complete and utter farce that could have been oh so much better.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Stepford Wives&#34; tells the story of Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman), an extremely driven career women who suffers a nervous breakdown.  Husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) decides to move her and the family to the gated community of Stepford, managed by Mike Wellington (Christopher Walken).  In Stepford, however, Joanna and newfound friend Bobbie (Bette Midler) try to unravel the mystery behind the &#34;always-smiling, just-a-little-too-perfect&#34; Stepford wives and their odd husbands.I would give a spoiler alert here (and it still stands if you know absolute nothing about this movie), but the trailers and film itself do a pretty good job ruining that department.  To be blunt, it is so obvious that the Stepford wives are robots (based on a few incredibly stupid scenes and some really bad special effects) that it pretty much kills the ending.  It's almost like director Frank Oz was trying to mock the original film instead of crafting the taut masterpiece that could have been.And that truly is what is so sad about &#34;The Stepford Wives&#34;.  The social concepts behind the film are very, very interesting for both men and women to think about, but this effort makes a mockery for them.  It plays serious issues for sight gags and farcical humor.  Heck, a movie like this would have worked better even as horror or suspense, but the comedy sinks it like an anchor.Basically, the only reason I can give the movie even two stars is because that &#34;kernel of story&#34; is interesting.  My exact rating would be about 1.5 stars, because I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that &#34;screwed it up&#34; this bad in the story-interpretation department.",2,Why Couldn't It Have Just Taken Itself Seriously?!,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,2020,"['Sometimes', 'watching', 'film', 'great', 'potential', 'difficult', 'understand', 'believe', 'inexplicable', 'choices', 'film-makers', 'decide', '34', 'Stepford', 'Wives', '34', 'great', 'kernel', 'story', 'turned', 'almost', 'complete', 'utter', 'farce', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'oh', 'so', 'much', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Stepford', 'Wives', '34', 'story', 'Joanna', 'Eberhart', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'extremely', 'driven', 'career', 'women', 'who', 'suffers', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Husband', 'Walter', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'move', 'family', 'gated', 'community', 'Stepford', 'managed', 'Mike', 'Wellington', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Stepford', 'however', 'Joanna', 'newfound', 'friend', 'Bobbie', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'try', 'unravel', 'mystery', '34', 'always-smiling', 'just-a-little-too-perfect', '34', 'Stepford', 'wives', 'odd', 'husbands.I', 'would', 'give', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'here', 'still', 'know', 'absolute', 'nothing', 'movie', 'trailers', 'film', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'ruining', 'department', 'be', 'blunt', 'so', 'obvious', 'Stepford', 'wives', 'are', 'robots', 'based', 'few', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'scenes', 'really', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'pretty', 'much', 'ending', 'almost', 'like', 'director', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'was', 'trying', 'mock', 'original', 'film', 'instead', 'crafting', 'taut', 'masterpiece', 'could', 'have', 'been.And', 'truly', 'what', 'so', 'sad', '34', 'Stepford', 'Wives', '34', 'social', 'concepts', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'interesting', 'men', 'women', 'think', 'effort', 'mockery', 'serious', 'issues', 'sight', 'gags', 'farcical', 'humor', 'Heck', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'even', 'horror', 'suspense', 'comedy', 'anchor.Basically', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'even', 'two', 'stars', '34', 'kernel', 'story', '34', 'interesting', 'exact', 'rating', 'would', 'be', '1.5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', '34', 'screwed', 'up', '34', 'bad', 'story-interpretation', 'department']",N/A
