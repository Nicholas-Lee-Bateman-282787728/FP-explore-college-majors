SO WHY NOT DAVINCI'S INQUEST AND DAVINCI THE MAYOR?CBC is rebroadcasting both series and the audience is still there.  Chris Haddock has a following and ACORN continues to fail to respond to that.You've read all the rave reviews about this series.  And they're right - it does get better and better.CBC should bring back anything produced by Chris Haddock - and why not bring DaVinci back?And furthermore - why not put ""The Quality of Life"" on DVD as a movie?It was a great show, ran one night, and those who love DaVinci will love ""Quality...."", if they missed that one opportunity to view it.  Are you listening, ACORN?  Chris Haddock's shows have a following and you wouldn't be putting the 2nd part of ""Intelligence"" out on DVD right now if you didn't realize that.  I find it ridiculous that you don't just put out a pack of all the DaVinci's Inquest shows and another of DaVinci the Mayor.
