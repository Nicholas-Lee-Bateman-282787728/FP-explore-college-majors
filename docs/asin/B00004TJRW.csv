Hogan,"[3, 3]","Brother cadfael, 12th ecntury benedictine monk and herbalist of the abbey of St Peterand St Paul, of Shrewsbury has been transformed into life by Sir Derek jacobi,and in a way, has become his as much as his creators,Ellis Peters. In this entry,the civil war raging between King Stephen and Empress Maud[never far from any of the 20 stories]is raging on...It opens with Brother oswin,cadfaels clumsly,sweet novice wandering about in a snowstorm,then coming uopn a gropup of badints, and being beaten and stabbed and left for dead. A missing pair of teens,their teacher{a nun}, a lord,some wayward crusaders,another crusader and our intrepid slueth are intertwined very well. The scene of the frozen corpse being melted by candle while gregorian chant in sung is very well done,though much of the snowfall looks like soap flakes. The acting is first rate. Jacobi has done, to the same degree with a lesser literary figure, what the late Sir Alec Guiness did with John Le Carre's Geroge Smiley: made him so much his own it is difficult to distinguish between the two.There are a couple of surprises here, a twist at the end,and a satisfying conclusion  to this chapter. The video is not vey well filmed at least my dvd was poorly shot. I do not think it was the transfer,I think it was the quality of the original recording. I have vhs copies of this series that are much better productions. Also, there are no special features worth talking about. So to sum up, nice storyline, superb acting from Jacobi,interesting moments,poor quality recording.",4,One of the better entries,979862400,"01 19, 2001",2001,1545,"['Brother', 'cadfael', '12th', 'ecntury', 'benedictine', 'monk', 'herbalist', 'abbey', 'St', 'Peterand', 'St', 'Paul', 'Shrewsbury', 'been', 'transformed', 'life', 'Sir', 'Derek', 'jacobi', 'way', 'become', 'as', 'much', 'creators', 'Ellis', 'Peters', 'entry', 'civil', 'war', 'raging', 'King', 'Stephen', 'Empress', 'Maud', '[', 'never', 'far', '20', 'stories', ']', 'raging', 'Brother', 'oswin', 'cadfaels', 'clumsly', 'sweet', 'novice', 'wandering', 'snowstorm', 'then', 'coming', 'uopn', 'gropup', 'badints', 'being', 'beaten', 'stabbed', 'left', 'dead', 'missing', 'pair', 'teens', 'teacher', 'nun', 'lord', 'wayward', 'crusaders', 'crusader', 'intrepid', 'slueth', 'are', 'intertwined', 'very', 'well', 'scene', 'frozen', 'corpse', 'being', 'melted', 'candle', 'gregorian', 'chant', 'sung', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'though', 'much', 'snowfall', 'looks', 'soap', 'flakes', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'Jacobi', 'done', 'same', 'degree', 'lesser', 'literary', 'figure', 'what', 'late', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'did', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'Geroge', 'Smiley', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'are', 'couple', 'surprises', 'here', 'twist', 'end', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'chapter', 'video', 'not', 'vey', 'well', 'filmed', 'least', 'dvd', 'was', 'poorly', 'shot', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'transfer', 'think', 'was', 'quality', 'original', 'recording', 'have', 'vhs', 'copies', 'series', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'productions', 'Also', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'talking', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'nice', 'storyline', 'superb', 'acting', 'Jacobi', 'interesting', 'moments', 'poor', 'quality', 'recording']",N/A

They were accompanied by Sister Hilaria, a nun who is Ermina's chaperon. In the opening scene, we see Sister Hilaria and Brother Oswin taking shelter from a blizzard in a shepherd's cottage which is used to store feed for the sheep. They must cuddle together to keep warm, and you know how nervous Oswin is around women. That Hilaria is quite pretty doesn't help him relax.So when he is brought into the abbey nearly dead, the twit Brother Jerome overhears him raving about holding her close and kissing her, and his guilt and shame. And where is Hilaria? She's the virgin under the ice in the title. She'd been thrown in the river before it froze over. And the two young people are missing. This is especially bad since a troop of Queen Maud of Wales' soldiers are roaming about the countryside.I'm not going to give too much away, but a major part of the plot involves the fact that Ermina no longer wishes to marry the local lord, and is instead in love with Olivier de Bretagne, lately from the Holy Lands, the bastard son of a Muslim widow and a crusader father he never knew. All he knows is that his mother spoke well of him, calling him brave and kind, and saying that he never knew she was pregnant when he left, or he would not have left.What does all this have to do with Brother Cadfael? Well, he was in the Holy Land at about the time Olivier was conceived.

550666,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B00004TJRW,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[32, 35]","Do you like BBC dramatizations with fine actors such as Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius) and Alan Rickman (Sense and Sensibility)? Do you like first class mystery stories you can watch over and over because the plots are  complicated and you miss some of the detail the first or second time you  see the film? Do you like romance and action set in the Middle Ages? Are  you fascinated with daily life in a monastery and the fine art of healing  with herbs and remedies learned by an ex-Crusader now turned healing monk?The time is the mid-1100s.  Queen Maude and King Stephen, first cousins  who each claim the throne of England, have divided the land in Civil War.  &quot;The Virgin in the Ice&quot; is set in the town of Shrewsbury England,  near the border with Wales. Brother Cadfael (Jacobi) is an ex-Crusader, who  in his old age has become a member of the Abby of Saints Peter and Paul.  When he was as a Crusader, Cadfael acquired the knowledge healing from  Miriam, a woman he knew in the Holy Land (and the Biblical sense). He  ministers to the monks at the abbey, the town folks, and any others who may  need his services.One bleak mid-winter night, Cadfael's young  assistant is found half frozen on a road near the abbey. He has been badly  beaten and is semicomotose from a skull fracture. Cadfael nurses him back  from death's door. Meanwhile, Brother Jerome, the abbey &quot;snitch&quot;  and troublemaker overhears Cadfael's assistant ranting about a woman.  Brother Jerome jumps to the conclusion the young man has done something  very bad. The young monk had been in the company of a young noble woman and  her tutor a young nun when last seen. Now he has been found alone. What  could possibly have happened?Cadfael, being a careful and sensible  monk does not jump to conclusions.  He goes in search of clues. In the  process of tracking footprints in the snow, and other traces of the party  of travelers, Cadfael stumbles on a young boy who says he was overrun by  brigands and separated from his sister and her tutor. Cadfael discovers the  boy is the son of a nobleman loyal to Queen Maude's side of the civil  dispute.  En route back to the abbey, while crossing a stream, Cadfael  spots a face peering up at him from the frozen water--a virgin in the ice.The rest of the story Cadfael tries to determine what happened. How did  the young woman die? Who killed her?  Where is the sister and where is the  nun? Was the party attacked by King Stephen's loyalists? Was it attacked by  a rebel band of ex-Crusaders who have become thieves and highwaymen? Did  the young monk attack the women? How does the young nobelwoman's fiance  figure into the equasion.  And then, there's the mysterious young man with  an olive complexion who was clearly a Crusader, and has orders to bring the  young man and woman to a preselected destination south of Shrewsbury.&quot;The Virgin in the Ice&quot; was one of the best of the  dramatizations of one of the best of Ellis Peters 20 volume series on  Cadfael.",5,One of Cadfael's best cases...,960595200,"06 10, 2000",2000,3012,"['Do', 'BBC', 'dramatizations', 'fine', 'actors', 'such', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Claudius', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Do', 'first', 'class', 'mystery', 'stories', 'can', 'watch', 'plots', 'are', 'complicated', 'miss', 'detail', 'first', 'second', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'Do', 'romance', 'action', 'set', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'Are', 'fascinated', 'daily', 'life', 'monastery', 'fine', 'art', 'healing', 'herbs', 'remedies', 'learned', 'ex-Crusader', 'now', 'turned', 'healing', 'monk', 'time', 'mid-1100s', 'Queen', 'Maude', 'King', 'Stephen', 'first', 'cousins', 'who', 'claim', 'throne', 'England', 'have', 'divided', 'land', 'Civil', 'War', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Ice', 'quot', 'set', 'town', 'Shrewsbury', 'England', 'border', 'Wales', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'Jacobi', 'ex-Crusader', 'who', 'old', 'age', 'become', 'member', 'Abby', 'Saints', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'When', 'was', 'Crusader', 'Cadfael', 'acquired', 'knowledge', 'healing', 'Miriam', 'woman', 'knew', 'Holy', 'Land', 'Biblical', 'sense', 'monks', 'abbey', 'town', 'folks', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'need', 'services.One', 'bleak', 'mid-winter', 'night', 'Cadfael', 'young', 'assistant', 'found', 'half', 'frozen', 'road', 'abbey', 'been', 'badly', 'beaten', 'semicomotose', 'skull', 'fracture', 'Cadfael', 'back', 'death', 'door', 'Meanwhile', 'Brother', 'Jerome', 'abbey', 'quot', 'snitch', 'quot', 'troublemaker', 'overhears', 'Cadfael', 'assistant', 'ranting', 'woman', 'Jerome', 'jumps', 'conclusion', 'young', 'man', 'done', 'something', 'very', 'bad', 'young', 'monk', 'had', 'been', 'company', 'young', 'noble', 'woman', 'tutor', 'young', 'nun', 'when', 'last', 'seen', 'Now', 'been', 'found', 'alone', 'What', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'happened', 'Cadfael', 'being', 'careful', 'sensible', 'monk', 'not', 'jump', 'conclusions', 'search', 'clues', 'process', 'tracking', 'footprints', 'snow', 'other', 'traces', 'party', 'travelers', 'Cadfael', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'overrun', 'brigands', 'separated', 'sister', 'tutor', 'Cadfael', 'boy', 'son', 'nobleman', 'loyal', 'Queen', 'Maude', 'side', 'civil', 'dispute', 'En', 'route', 'back', 'abbey', 'crossing', 'stream', 'Cadfael', 'spots', 'face', 'peering', 'up', 'frozen', 'water', 'virgin', 'ice.The', 'rest', 'story', 'Cadfael', 'determine', 'what', 'happened', 'How', 'did', 'young', 'woman', 'die', 'Who', 'killed', 'Where', 'sister', 'where', 'nun', 'Was', 'party', 'attacked', 'King', 'Stephen', 'loyalists', 'Was', 'attacked', 'rebel', 'band', 'ex-Crusaders', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'thieves', 'highwaymen', 'Did', 'young', 'monk', 'women', 'How', 'young', 'nobelwoman', 'fiance', 'figure', 'equasion', 'then', 'mysterious', 'young', 'man', 'olive', 'complexion', 'who', 'was', 'clearly', 'Crusader', 'orders', 'bring', 'young', 'man', 'woman', 'preselected', 'destination', 'south', 'Shrewsbury.', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Ice', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'dramatizations', 'one', 'best', 'Ellis', 'Peters', '20', 'volume', 'series', 'Cadfael']",N/A

Brother Cadfael is a Benedictine monk living during the war-torn years of the middle ages. Stationed in England but of Welsh descent, he was a crusader during his middle years and therefore has knowledge of both the outer world as well as the church life.This episode shows that life 'back then' wasn't always quiet and peaceful. Two children are lost, nuns are violated and killed, ransom and murder are the items of the day. Even with these rough acts going on, men and women find ways to show compassion and love.It is one of the earlier episodes, with the set and costumes being perhaps a bit sparklier than they need to be, but the acting is fantastic and the plot great as well.
