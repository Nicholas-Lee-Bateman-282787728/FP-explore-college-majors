1523153,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B006ZL2T66,A Forest Fan,"[1, 2]","Including the Bluray and DVD together is a good value, however I did not find the movie a good continuation of the Battlestar franchise. The title is somewhat odd, as they removed the Chrome cylons from this movie that are supposed to be there at this early time. But there is plenty of blood!Loosely based on ""Gun on Ice Planet Zero"" from the original series, this direct to DVD movie does nothing to tie together Caprica with the 2nd series. This franchise clings to life like a moaning Centurion. Where to begin on the problems here?The Cylon base star can spew out 200 Cylon Raiders in .3 nanoseconds, all twirling at impossible-for-humans g-forces. We are shown one of these old Base Stars hovering over a major city as it is being wrecked. This base star looks enormously more expensive in materials and technology than the 50 megaton nuke missiles they used in the 2nd series pilot. The disparity in effectiveness is embarrassing between that pilot and what these base stars could do 50 years prior. Why switch to cheap missiles later on? Why can't a base star hovering near a major city cause more damage than what we are shown? Serious plausibility issues here, how could the humans not have lost the 50-years-ago war in a matter of days? The old Cylons are seemingly invincible and perfect, they would never have needed Baltar to open the computer defenses, if they had 50 years to improve on what we see here.The jumping off ship (""Osiris"") has very poorly matched CGI with the human actors in their cramped bridge. They take damage that appears to blow up their entire human component section, yet we switch to the actors who are shaking around with steam and sparks. If the Cylons can overtake human ships this quickly with just the first shot, why was this war taking so long for the Cylons to win? The more effective they show the ""scary old Cylons"", the more unbelievable they ever got to film a 2nd series.Lots of issues with what we are shown. Why do humans routinely fly around without their spacesuits on? Those bubble canopies do not look too sturdy (as we are reminded in the opening minutes of this movie). The dumbest part was after the Cylons had consolidated their hold on the orbit of the ice planet, swarming the planet with Cylon raider patrols and a deadly base star, a ""rescue ship"" somehow bypasses the certain death hovering above and rescues our heroes. How? No explanation for stupidity, with a final kitchen fight scene ripped off from the original Jurassic Park (replace cgi velociraptors with cgi junk-face Cylon centurions). What happened to the centurion look that they were supposed to have 50 years ago (on ""Caprica"" and ""Razor Flashbacks"")? Why does the dual Vulcan cannon on the raptors (the ship not the dinos) look like they weigh substantially more than any other system on the jump-capable starship? Would they really designate more room to aft weapons than fuel or radiation shielding systems (which is a clear plexiglass bubble canopy of questionable value)? Finally, why wasn't everyone in Battlestar Galactica's hangar bays blinded by the ridiculous LENS FLARE from every direction? A blind crew is the best way to beat the ""toasters""?Speaking of the toasters, I was vaguely uncomfortable with the racist terminology involved. No issues raised here for the audience of the moral issues of humanity verses machines. The story closes with the head machine telling the activist that they hate her as much as the other humans. Does hate seem like a useful component of machine intelligence? Nothing was explored here as to motivation, this could have been explored more. Nothing wrong with action, I hope the cast has more opportunities in future installments.",2,Where is the Chrome?,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,3708,"['Including', 'Bluray', 'DVD', 'together', 'good', 'value', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'good', 'continuation', 'Battlestar', 'franchise', 'title', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'removed', 'Chrome', 'cylons', 'movie', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'early', 'time', 'plenty', 'blood', 'Loosely', 'based', 'Gun', 'Ice', 'Planet', 'Zero', 'original', 'series', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movie', 'nothing', 'tie', 'together', 'Caprica', '2nd', 'series', 'franchise', 'life', 'moaning', 'Centurion', 'Where', 'begin', 'problems', 'here', 'Cylon', 'base', 'star', 'can', 'spew', 'out', '200', 'Cylon', 'Raiders', '.3', 'nanoseconds', 'twirling', 'impossible-for-humans', 'g-forces', 'are', 'shown', 'one', 'old', 'Base', 'Stars', 'hovering', 'major', 'city', 'being', 'wrecked', 'base', 'star', 'enormously', 'more', 'expensive', 'materials', 'technology', '50', 'megaton', 'nuke', 'used', '2nd', 'series', 'pilot', 'disparity', 'effectiveness', 'embarrassing', 'pilot', 'what', 'base', 'stars', 'could', 'do', '50', 'years', 'prior', 'Why', 'switch', 'cheap', 'missiles', 'later', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'base', 'star', 'hovering', 'major', 'city', 'cause', 'more', 'damage', 'what', 'are', 'shown', 'Serious', 'plausibility', 'issues', 'here', 'how', 'could', 'humans', 'not', 'have', 'lost', '50-years-ago', 'war', 'matter', 'days', 'old', 'Cylons', 'are', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'perfect', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'needed', 'Baltar', 'open', 'computer', 'had', '50', 'years', 'improve', 'what', 'see', 'here.The', 'jumping', 'off', 'ship', 'Osiris', 'very', 'poorly', 'matched', 'CGI', 'human', 'actors', 'cramped', 'bridge', 'take', 'damage', 'blow', 'up', 'entire', 'human', 'component', 'section', 'yet', 'switch', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'shaking', 'steam', 'sparks', 'Cylons', 'can', 'overtake', 'human', 'ships', 'quickly', 'just', 'first', 'shot', 'why', 'was', 'war', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'Cylons', 'win', 'more', 'effective', 'show', 'scary', 'old', 'Cylons', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'ever', 'got', 'film', '2nd', 'series.Lots', 'issues', 'what', 'are', 'shown', 'Why', 'do', 'humans', 'routinely', 'fly', 'around', 'spacesuits', 'bubble', 'canopies', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'too', 'sturdy', 'are', 'reminded', 'opening', 'minutes', 'movie', 'dumbest', 'part', 'was', 'Cylons', 'had', 'consolidated', 'hold', 'orbit', 'ice', 'planet', 'swarming', 'planet', 'Cylon', 'raider', 'patrols', 'deadly', 'base', 'star', 'rescue', 'ship', 'somehow', 'certain', 'death', 'hovering', 'rescues', 'heroes', 'How', 'explanation', 'stupidity', 'final', 'kitchen', 'fight', 'scene', 'ripped', 'original', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'replace', 'cgi', 'velociraptors', 'cgi', 'junk-face', 'Cylon', 'centurions', 'What', 'happened', 'centurion', 'look', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Caprica', 'Razor', 'Flashbacks', 'Why', 'dual', 'Vulcan', 'cannon', 'raptors', 'ship', 'not', 'dinos', 'look', 'weigh', 'substantially', 'more', 'other', 'system', 'jump-capable', 'starship', 'Would', 'really', 'designate', 'more', 'room', 'aft', 'weapons', 'fuel', 'radiation', 'shielding', 'systems', 'clear', 'plexiglass', 'bubble', 'canopy', 'questionable', 'value', 'Finally', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'hangar', 'bays', 'blinded', 'ridiculous', 'LENS', 'FLARE', 'direction', 'blind', 'crew', 'best', 'way', 'beat', 'toasters', 'Speaking', 'toasters', 'was', 'vaguely', 'uncomfortable', 'racist', 'terminology', 'involved', 'issues', 'raised', 'here', 'audience', 'moral', 'issues', 'humanity', 'verses', 'machines', 'story', 'head', 'machine', 'telling', 'activist', 'hate', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'humans', 'Does', 'hate', 'seem', 'useful', 'component', 'machine', 'intelligence', 'Nothing', 'was', 'explored', 'here', 'motivation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'more', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'action', 'hope', 'cast', 'more', 'opportunities', 'future', 'installments']",Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome
1523154,AU0FHYE1IT05S,B006ZL2T66,A. Hayes,"[4, 7]","Just finished up watching the last installment of the web series. It was good to see a Galatica spin-off that came back to the action-adventure roots, not that Caprica isn't good but it was a drama take on the universe.Blood & Chrome by no means is as slick as a the reboot. Lots of green screen shots, lots of CGI that doesn't match up to the budget of the SyFy show. All in all, a good start. The story has some holes and some predictable twists along with some others you don't see coming. Luke Pasqualino as Adama seems to settle into things and could develop into a strong lead. Ben Cotton's portrayal of the warworn veteran, Coker, who can't stand his new rookie pilot is probably the strongest of the lot. The side characters are really good as well. Some of the writing is really good. While I won't write them here they are both toward the end of the last web episode, one for each side. They set up the rest of potential series very nicely. They are also pretty poignant in their own right.All in all a good pilot for a show I would watch week in and week out should it be picked up as a series though I'm not holding my breath. Maybe a web series?

New management at Syfy wants to capitalize on the success of the series, but shies away from the very things that made the series great in this prequel to Battlestar Galactica set during the original Cylon war, featuring a young, brash and inexperienced William Adama, so different from the redoubtable, stalwart Adama we came to know during the series. This would be fine and a way to deepen the character if the writers hadn't used every possible cliche for the eager young man full of idealism and vinegar but lacking in experience.The show opens late in the Cylon War with a just qualified William Adama coming aboard Galactica to begin his service as a pilot. He is disappointed to be assigned to raptor duty and argues the decision. His world weary navigator looks on in amusement and dismay, in fact this character is the strongest character in the movie. The war is not going well and Husker, as Adama is known and his navigator are sent on a mission to get a scientist to a place she needs to be to possibly affect the outcome of the war, an abandoned winter resort moon with a Cylon station on it. I did like the homage to The Empire Strikes Back in the setting of the winter moon and the monster in the cave that almost kills the intrepid hero.I'm always happy to watch Battlestar Galactica and will watch the series if Blood and Chrome is picked up, but hope and pray that the writers are allowed to transcend cliche in plot and character as evidenced in Blood and Chrome as currently constituted. The journey from innocence to experience is ever green in terms of story telling, but readers and viewers need to get something other than the hackneyed to buy into the concept. I know Caprica was criticized for being slow moving, overly complex and despairing, but Blood and Chrome is an over correction in that it is a paint by the numbers tale of a young man gaining his first battle experience.The main moral conflict, that of the scientist Adama is ferrying around a battle has potential but is examined too facilely. Didn't the Cylon War ultimately end because the Colonies took on her pragmatic approach? Wouldn't it have been more interesting if that was addressed rather than the straight on black and white, good and evil adventure tale we are given? Blood and Chrome was entertaining for ninety minutes and I will always support the franchise with my wallet and with my reviews in the hopes that we get another series as great as Battlestar Galactic, but Blood and Chrome, while it had potential, was a mere shadow of the series.

1523168,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B006ZL2T66,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[54, 69]","It is the tenth year of the Cylon War. The Colonial Fleet is gradually being worn down by their former slaves turned enemies, the Cylons. Bill Adama, a newly-graduated pilot assigned to the battlestar Galactica, takes part in what should be a simple escort mission but turns into a major operation which could have important ramifications for the entire war.Blood and Chrome started life as a proposed full spin-off series of the new(er) Battlestar Galactica. The first spin-off, Caprica, had been a failure and was cancelled after one season. Popular opinion has it that the show was too talky, too cerebral and simply too dull, having moved away from the dogfights and political infighting that made the original series so compelling. For this second spin-off, the proposal was to make a balls-to-the-wall action show, a Top Gun in space with Vipers and Cylons. Setting the show during the First Cylon War would also allow the show to resolve some storylines from Caprica - which took place about sixteen years earlier - and foreshadow some of the events of BSG itself (which starts about forty-two years later).In the event, it never happened. Blood and Chrome - the proposed pilot episode of the spin-off - was not picked up and, unless the imminent DVD/Blu-Ray release sells like gangbusters, will not be in the future. As it stands, it is left behind as a curiosity and, it has to be said, not a particularly compelling one.Blood and Chrome was not filmed in the traditional manner. With the existing (massive and expensive-to-maintain) Galactica sets all destroyed at the end of filming, the producers were forced to rely on greenscreens and digital scans to reproduce the original sets. In fact, they were able to adjust the sets to reflect the fact that it's forty years earlier, with less-advanced technology available. The same 'bones' of the original structures are there, but the detailing is different. This works quite well, giving the sense that this is the same ship at a different point in its lifespan. The quality of the greenscreen sets is rather variable, with most of them falling into the 'somewhat fake but you don't notice after a while' category. Some of them are pretty good: the CIC set is surprisingly well-done, though the fact that it's quite a dark set helps. On the other hand, scenes on the ice planet and inside the abandoned facility there are blatantly fake. There's also rather too much lens flare going on in the CGI scenes, which gets distracting after a while.Other CGI is reasonable, though the decision was made to use very fast cuts. This meant both an insane number of CGI shots (this 120-minute TV movie has more than 1,800 shots, compared to 1,488 for the three-and-a-half hour cinematic film The Return of the King) and almost no time to appreciate them. Whilst the original show was guilty of fast-paced cutting at times which made it difficult to follow what was going on, Blood and Chrome takes this to a new level. The confrontation between the Colonial heavy cruiser Osiris and a Cylon basestar should be a tense, epic moment, but instead turns into a confusing melee of badly-cut CGI shots and explosions. Given that Blood and Chrome has resources available to it that Ronald Moore and his team would have killed to have on the original BSG pilot a decade ago, it's a shame to see them wasted in such a fashion.That leaves the writing and acting to back up the effects and, unfortunately, neither are very accomplished. There's some attempts at characterisation which should be a lot stronger than it is, since the show really only has to focus on Adama, his co-pilot Coker and their civilian passenger Becca for most of its length. Instead it's all a bit half-hearted and actors Luke Pasqualino, Ben Cotton and Lili Bordan seem uninspired by the material, which is cliched and trite. A few attempts to lampshade the macho pilot genre of action films and series fall flat (as the show immediately employs many of those tropes with no sense of irony or intelligence). Later in the movie there is an attempt to discuss the rights and wrongs of the war and its immense bodycount, but it's all rather tepid compared to the issues that the original BSG raised on a regular basis. There's also a cameo appearance by a BSG regular which helps place the TV movie a bit better in the timeline, but even this misfires as it causes confusion with the flashback scenes in the BSG TV movie Razor, which supposedly happens two years after Blood and Chrome.What we are left with, then, is a confusing morass of explosions, a ton of CGI (some impressive, most not), some cliched writing and indifferent performances, with occasional bursts of effort. What Blood and Chrome does prove, conclusively, is that BSG is at its heart about compelling characters, ethical conflicts and difficult-to-answer questions. Removing the ambiguity in favour of explosions and space dogfights clearly does not work. However, given that in a few years (when technology has improved a bit more) a lot more shows may be made this way, it's certainly worth watching as a hint of the future of TV production.Blood and Chrome (**) will be available on 19 February.",2,"Variable CGI, a bad script and indifferent performances make this a hard slog",1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,5180,"['tenth', 'year', 'Cylon', 'War',

They are the only channels showing anything bold or even remotely considered sci-fi. That would be a show called ""Falling Skies"", the single closest thing to sci-fi on American television. Shame.The actual SYFY channel has completely abandoned all things science fiction. A few years ago MGM was taken over by new management and they immediately decided to cancel the following: SG:A, SG:U, the new SG-1 movie (SG: Revolution), and the new SG:A movie (SGA: Extinction).As long as this current bunch of skin-jobs is in charge we will never get real sci-fi. Instead we get a steady diet of rediculous monster movies with horrible acting and direction. We get fed one ghost hunting show after another. We're up to 5 of those shows now right? Oh and my personal favorite - wresting. Wrestling? What the fraaaaak? I just cant wait to see steroid injected men all greased up in baby oil throwing eachother around for a buck. Yup.

The new faces are top picks as well including the guy playing young (and dumb) Adama.The picture quality is brutally sharp and crisp on Blu-ray disc. The audio is big and precise, as I expected, especially for those of us with surround sound systems (Definitive Technology 8.2).The CG effects for Blood & Chrome are only rivaled in the movies! A small gripe for us computer animators - we'll instantly notice the underdeveloped dynamics programing and very quick decay rates on those effects but other than that it's all top grade stuff. I understand that the action-packed nature of the pilot/movie is to give the viewers a glimps of the kind of quality and intensity the show has to offer with following episodes. To bad that's not going to happen.I will forever be se stunned at how something this amazing will never get off the ground. We have screwed ourselves out of truly brilliant story telling. Again.

Fresh out of the academy, Adama (played by Luke Pasqualino) is assigned to the powerful battlestar Galactica, where he's met with contention from his co-pilot Coker (Ben Cotton), and is assigned to escort a beautiful but mysterious woman (Lili Bordan) on a secret mission.Originally shown in small ""webisodes"" online, almost every shot from Blood & Chrome was done on green screen. The result is A LOT of CGI, most of which looks really great. The space and aerial battles especially look marvelous, and the few Cylons you see look really good as well. There were a few action and landscape shots I thought looked kind of cheap but overall, when you consider almost the entire show was created in post-production, the effects rival a lot of shows on TV today and look very similar to those seen on the BSG series.Blood & Chrome was created with hopes of getting a series order in mind, which probably won't happen, and because of this the story and character development felt rushed to me. There's really only the three main characters, none of which I really got attached to, and a few other supporting characters that had a few lines. Perhaps because the creators thought they would get a series out of the show, they were going to save some of the backstory and further development for later. However, as it stands the 90 minute show doesn't really tell you much about who these characters are or what brought them to the Galactica. It also didn't help that the cast is made up of relatively unknown actors who, thought they try, don't have the chops to keep up with the actors from the reimagined BSG series. The story was fun and engaging, I just wish there had been more depth.The Bluray set comes with DVD and digital copies, as well as a few extras including a bunch of deleted scenes and a making-of featurette that delves into the visual effects created for Blood and Chrome. This behind-the-scenes feature is quite interesting to watch as it interviews most of the people involved in the creative process behind the special and gives some awesome insight into the development and creation of making a show that's most computer generated.If you're a fan of the Ron Moore, series I would definitely check this out. It's not quite up to par with the series but is still a fun adventure that will make you want to revisit the sci-fi series.On a side note, the 188 minutes Amazon lists as the running time is inaccurate; the feature itself is around 90 minutes and I think Amazon added the Bluray and DVD discs together.",4,Great CGI Makes for Exciting Prequel to Battlestar Galactica,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2759,"['Trying', 'piggyback', 'off', 'success', 'cult', 'following', 'reimagined', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'series', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'story', 'young', 'William', 'Adama', 'first', 'mission', 'member', 'Colonial', 'fleet', 'Fresh', 'academy', 'Adama', 'played', 'Luke', 'Pasqualino', 'assigned', 'powerful', 'battlestar', 'Galactica', 'where', 'met', 'contention', 'co-pilot', 'Coker', 'Ben', 'Cotton', 'assigned', 'escort', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'Lili', 'Bordan', 'secret', 'mission.Originally', 'shown', 'small', 'webisodes', 'online', 'almost', 'shot', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'was', 'done', 'green', 'screen', 'result', 'LOT', 'CGI', 'most', 'really', 'great', 'space', 'aerial', 'battles', 'especially', 'look', 'marvelous', 'few', 'Cylons', 'see', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'few', 'action', 'landscape', 'shots', 'thought', 'looked', 'kind', 'cheap', 'overall', 'when', 'consider', 'almost', 'entire', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'post-production', 'effects', 'rival', 'lot', 'shows', 'TV', 'today', 'look', 'very', 'similar', 'seen', 'BSG', 'series.Blood', 'Chrome', 'was', 'created', 'hopes', 'getting', 'series', 'order', 'mind', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'felt', 'rushed', 'really', 'only', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'none', 'really', 'got', 'attached', 'few', 'other', 'supporting', 'characters', 'had', 'few', 'lines', 'Perhaps', 'creators', 'thought', 'would', 'get', 'series', 'show', 'were', 'going', 'save', 'backstory', 'further', 'development', 'later', 'However', '90', 'minute', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'much', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'brought', 'Galactica', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'cast', 'made', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actors', 'who', 'thought', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chops', 'keep', 'up', 'actors', 'reimagined', 'BSG', 'series', 'story', 'was', 'fun', 'engaging', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'depth.The', 'Bluray', 'set', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copies', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'extras', 'including', 'bunch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'visual', 'effects', 'created', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feature', 'quite', 'interesting', 'watch', 'most', 'people', 'involved', 'creative', 'process', 'special', 'awesome', 'insight', 'development', 'creation', 'making', 'show', 'most', 'computer', 'generated.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'series', 'would', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'series', 'still', 'fun', 'adventure', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'revisit', 'sci-fi', 'series.On', 'side', 'note', '188', 'minutes', 'Amazon', 'running', 'time', 'inaccurate', 'feature', 'around', '90', 'minutes', 'think', 'Amazon', 'added', 'Bluray', 'DVD', 'discs', 'together']",Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome

1523204,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006ZL2T66,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 2004, the sci-fi series ""Battlestar Galactica"", a re-imaging of the 1978 series would be featured on the Sci-Fi Channel.  From its three-hour mini-series and four more seasons that would last through 2009, the series would receive critical acclaim and would win countless awards.The original series was about humans who have lived in peace after a war against the cybernetic race known as the Cylons (robots originally created by humans and later rebelled).  With humans living in planets known as the Twelve Colonies, the Cylons launched a sneak attack on the colonies and literally causing devastation and death to the the human population.  Only 50,000 of the billions of humans survive and those who do survive are escorted on civilian space ships.The series would introduce the Battlestar Galactica, a military capital ship that survived attack but was to be decommissioned.  And the responsibility of taking care of these humans on his ship is Colonial Fleet Officer Commander William ""Bill"" Adama.And would feature the adventures of his crew as they would try to find a safehaven for humankind, to find the Planet Earth and to find a way to defeat the Cylons.To best explain how or why the humans created the Cylons, a prequel that takes place 58 before the events of ""Battlestar Galactica"" was created and the series was known as ""Caprica"" (which would last one season) and would feature the father of William Adama.When there was discussion to make a ""Battlestar Galactica"" prequel as a video game with live action cut scenes, the plan was to create digital reconstructions of the sets of ""Battlestar Galactica"" but set around 40 years before the events of ""Battlestar Galactica"".  Creating a virtual set, SyFy was pleased with the development of the project and wanted the storyline that was created to be made into a two-hour pilot.So, in 2011, shooting began for the prequel known as ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" which would originally be planned for an online release.  By November 2012, the series would be released as ten 12-minute acts and was featured on Machinima.com and was aired on SyFy in February 2013.VIDEO:""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 widescreen).  The film was 90% pre-production, so a lot of what you see on screen is visual effects.  Cast was shot with green screen and the visual effects team worked their magic to make this film look good.  And I have to agree, the visual effects were fantastic!From the look of the ""Battlestar Galactica"" and its interiors to compliment the timeline of a younger William Adama to the look of a chilly frontier or battles in space, the film/online series benefited from today's technology to make things integrate with the cast members and nothing looks fake when we see the characters and the backgrounds/visual effects.  Everything looks real, well-lit and for the most part, looks fantastic on Blu-ray.I didn't see any artifacts, banding or any negative issues during my viewing of the film.  ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" looks great on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The overall film sounds very good with directional audio being used during the fight scenes through the surround channels.  I was hoping for a bit more immersion with the surround channels and also LFE, but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack was good.Subtitles are in English, Espanol and Francais.SPECIAL FEATURES""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" comes with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (29:22) Featuring 13 deleted scenes (note: deleted scenes are with green screen and not with finalized visual effects).Blood & Chrome: Visual Effects - (22:58) A featurette on how ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" came to be and how the series/film became 90% visual effects and more.EXTRAS:""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" comes with both the Blu-ray version and the DVD.  Also, included is a UltraViolet code that allows you to put your movies into the cloud to instantly stream and download to tablets, smartphones, computers and TV's.  Also, a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:As a fan of the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" and also even more of a bigger fan of the first three seasons of the re-imagined ""Battlestar Galactica"", watching ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" was a positive and enjoyable experience because it made me remember why I enjoyed the re-imaging to begin with.One thing that made me angry about re-imagining was where the writing went in the fourth season.  Having come out strong in with the first three seasons, I felt cheated with the fourth and with ""Caprica"", it was not what I was hoping for.""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" was exciting, action-packed but also featuring a storyline that is not too convoluted with characters.  The original kept introducing people and not knowing how to keep those characters going and it became a matter of ""who do we kill of"" and ""Who should we make into a Cylon"".  And unfortunately, those situations were the sign of the times (mid-2000&#8242;s) and we saw it with ""Heroes"" and ""Lost"", introducing too many characters and not knowing what to do with the.So, the efficacy of ""Battlestar Galatica: Blood & Chrome"" is that it's essentially about three characters.  Sure, there are many other characters introduce in the series, but the writers use these characters as a base for the three primary characters.William Adama is an ensign that is so full of himself.  Macho playboy fresh out of the academy and is so cocky, you can see what his son in the future, Lee Adama, was able to inherit from his father.  But for this film, it's about how a character grows and most importantly, seeing close-up of how the war was nothing like he expected.  Things that you were taught at the Academy were not necessarily true.Opposite to Adama is Lt. Coker Fasjovik, a man who has come close to death many times and with a month left on active mandatory service, he just wants to live and see his wife.  But he has been pulled into this mission which was supposed to be routine, but ends up being his most deadly mission that he has ever experienced in his lifetime and now he's not sure whether or not he will survive.And then you have Dr. Becca Kelly, the beautiful engineer that help create the Cylons.  A woman who is determined to complete her mission which hundreds and thousands of people would sacrifice their lives in order to make sure she achieves her mission.But what is that mission?  That is what audiences will find out as writers set the audience up for something surprising but also a fitting ending of this film that makes you craving for more.The Blu-ray release features the unrated version not seen online and I'm not entirely sure how many minutes are added to the unrated version and what the primary differences are but there some visuals that may be a little gory or a very short steamy love scene which was nothing to watch your back over.  But I would assume it's the former and what the three characters find inside of this ski resort, now being used by Cylons.Picture quality is fantastic, considering that the series is nearly all created in post.  The film is pretty much using current technology to showcase visual effects without using actual sets.  And a lot of acting within green screen.  And what I liked about this film is that the visual effects integrate with the characters remarkably well.  There is none of that fake background scene look that you often see in films, the crew behind the visual effects did a great job of making things look real.And it's a shame that the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series didn't have the same technology that they do now (or perhaps they did but it was too expensive) because the visual effects team really did a magnificent job.  May it be the flights in outerspace and the battles that take place.  To the overall look of the Battlestar Galactica, looking robust and new as it was featured 40 years ago with interiors that look fresh and new, not like the decommissioned, old version that was featured in the TV series.But the picture quality on Blu-ray for ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" is fantastic.  I didn't see any artifacts or any problems whatsoever.  Lossless audio was also well-done.  Maybe not as immersive as I would hope but there was still good directional sound coming through the surround channels but was looking for more immersion during the fight scenes and a bit more LFE.  Special features included nearly a half hour of deleted scenes but also a cool featurette on the visual effects.  Wish there were more special features (perhaps I have been spoiled by the previous ""Battlestar Galactica"" season box sets which included many extras) but for the most part, this Blu-ray release is quite solid!Overall, ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" was fantastic.  It captured the spirit of what I enjoyed about the re-imagined series (the moments I enjoyed from the first three seasons) but most of all, keeping things simple for the pilot, focusing on three primary characters without trying to bulk up the story with convoluted storylines of other characters.So, the pilot was fantastic, acting was also well-done and visual effects were stunning.  I really do hope that a TV series does happen for ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"". It contains the magic and also the action of what made those first three seasons of ""Battlestar Galactica"" so fun and exciting.  Wonderful storytelling and I hope that ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" does become a TV series or even an online series, because the SyFy channel needs more quality sci-fi shows and this film showed promise.Exciting, action-packed and thrilling from beginning to end, if you enjoyed the re-imagined series of ""Battlestar Galactica"", you will enjoy ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"".

It plays well as a movie-length film, and the only downside is that the powers that be at Sci-Fi (or any other cable/digital/broadcast entity) didn't green light this to become an ongoing series. Yes, the ""Caprica"" prequel turned out to be pretty dismal, but this show looks much better and more tightly focussed, and raises a number of interesting, unsettling issues about the history of the Human-Cylon conflict. Fortunately, Pasqualino is pretty baby-faced and young: I suppose it's possible he could still take up the role later on if the BSG creative team can get this series off the ground, even if it takes a few years.Anyway, if you're a Galactica fan, have no fear: this is exciting, satisfying, intelligently written and well-made.  It's no ""Caprica""; you will enjoy watching this show. The only problem you'll have is when it ends and you realize, that's it -- that's all she wrote.  Sigh.

News of Blood and Chrome and a short teaser of the same leaked out, most likely forcing them to allow it to be shown.  It was done with little budget and support from the network but in spite of that they did an outstanding job.  Seeing the actors that had previously played in Galactica playing different roles in this film, knowing they wouldn't make much money off of it, tells me they enjoyed the work they do, and it shows.

The TV series had a much grittier, real-world feel. Blood & Chrome by contrast feels a bit more Hollywoodized, like what I'd expect if Hollywood took over the franchise. Seems like there's more of a focus on battle scenes and adventure than the sort of intellectual/moral questions that the TV show explored so capably. It's not a bad movie, but it's like the equivalent of JJ Abram's Star Trek movie for the BSG franchise.Blood & Chrome also seems inconsistent with the characterization of Admiral William Adama from the TV show. Luke Pasqualino lacks the sort of intensity that Edward James Olmos brought to the character. Pasqualino's Adama seems too flippant, too much the hotshot. He also seems too thin and tall to be Adama. By contrast, I thought Nico Cortez did a much better job bringing the character to life in the TV movie Razor. According to Razor, Adama's first mission wasn't a space battle, as the character claims he hadn't gotten any kills yet, so the plot also seems inconsistent.I think Blood & Chrome could have avoided some of these problems by just not using Bill Adama as the main character.

1523225,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B006ZL2T66,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[3, 4]","&#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; is the franchise that will not die. The original television series in the 1970s was cancelled because of the cost of production. It was then revived for a short-lived budget-crunched version named &#34;Galactica 80,&#34; which brought the rag-tag fleet of star voyagers to the Earth and less special effects. The franchise was kept alive throughout the 1980s and 1990s by way of comic books and novels.2003 saw the launch of the rebooted version of &#34;Battlestar Galactica.&#34; After a mini-series, the television show went on for four seasons. It also spawned two TV movies and several web series. &#34;Caprica&#34; premiered in 2009, proving once again audiences just couldn't get enough of this sci-fi phenomenon. Unfortunately, the show ended abruptly after two seasons.&#34;Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome&#34; once again proves you can't keep a good show down. Originally filmed to be the pilot for a new SyFy Channel series, it was decided to split it up into 10 parts and aired on Machinima.com as a web series. The entire pilot has now been reassembled and made available on Blu-ray and DVD in an &#34;Unrated Edition.&#34;Young William Adama graduates from the Academy in the tenth year of the First Cylon War. He's appointed to serve aboard the Colonial Fleet's newest battlestar, the Galactica. His first assignment is as a pilot for a Raptor transport ship. Adama, his co-pilot Coker, and former Graystone Industries employee Dr. Beka Kelly are sent on a secret mission that will take them deep into Cylon territory.I refer to &#34;Blood and Chrome&#34; as the &#34;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&#34; of the epic &#34;BSG&#34; franchise. It takes place between &#34;Caprica&#34; and the 2003 series. Just like &#34;The Clone Wars,&#34; there's a surprise tie to the rebooted series as well. As R2-D2 and C-3PO do for those particular films, we have a certain character that ties the different eras together here.Director Jonas Pate takes series creators Michael Taylor and David Eick's script and successfully drops us back into the world of &#34;Battlestar Galactica.&#34; Pate has a history working within the universe, having helmed episodes of both &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; and &#34;Caprica.&#34; This helps give &#34;Blood and Chrome&#34; a familiar look that matches that of the earlier shows.The audio and video high-definition transfers give us a clear picture and highlight a brilliant score by Bear McCreary. Exceptional clarity does make the lens flare and blurred masking of some of the green screen shots more evident.

1523291,A2XTBEWAF272NG,B006ZL2T66,Layo,"[2, 2]","I enjoyed this, but it lacked the emotional depth that made BSG one of my favorite series of all time.  Many of the characters seemed overly-cliche, especially after having exulted in a series whose strength was that it made us see humanity in a new light.  The men were muy manly, grrrrr, which was fun but in retrospect felt shallow and almost cheesy.  See below the spoiler alert for my opinion of the main female character.The deleted scenes should have been kept in the main story.  It was sort of sad to watch them without CGI in many cases, since almost the entire set had to be rendered digitally.  They helped me care more about Adama, and gave his relationships depth, rather than the otherwise-inexplicable abrupt respect and desire we saw emerge from his co-pilot and passenger - without more context in which we see him kick serious butt while somehow fitting basketball-size nads into his flight suit, this made his character feel somewhat like a Mary Sue.  Nevertheless, I would have loved it if this had developed into a spin-off series.  I can't help it, I think I'd watch anything from this franchise.SPOILERS FOLLOWSeriously, a fracking femme fatale bordering on a Bond Girl in a series whose female characters were always so complex, skilled, macho and unfrothy?  Every other time we saw a betrayal on BSG, the motivation behind it was presented with sensitivity, the inner conflict in the treacherous character was explored carefully, and we saw how it ripped them up to feel cornered into making the choice they did.  Not so with this lady.  This dippy flapjack trod the worn-out trope of being resented for her authority over the men, desired for pretty much just her looks (because she had no character to speak of), and turning on humanity because bending over in the face of an overwhelming threat _always_ works out great - amirite ladies?  Let's risk our lives in a hopeless one-way mission just to grease up the rest of the species for conquest.  Sure!  That's consistent: brilliance and suicidal daring always go hand-in-glove with craven submission.  Right.  Because she's a girl, so naturally submission is the default even if she has to thread through battlestar wreckage while under cylon fire, fall 50 feet, battle snow monsters, hike through an icy wastleland, and shoot the people who've been on her side, all the while risking discovery and execution by her allies, in order to get the KY on the target.  Because yes, surrendering to machines makes perfect sense, since obviously machines have compassion and/or a use for a slave race, not.  She should have crucial insight into the nature of the Cylon since she helped design their minds, but she was very wrong.  No software engineer would be this much of an illogical bimbo.  This character was so disappointing and unbelievable that at the end of the show I was left with the impression that the writers were teenagers.  The fact that the men didn't shoot her in the face instead of leaving her where she lay once they knew what she was doing was the last straw.  Her character was treated as a 2-dimensional &#34;lady&#34; instead of a person, which is a massive regression from previous BSG standards.  At least she got to be used for the only thing a lady is good for, though?  So the entire thing wasn't a big fat exercise in disillusionment for our boy Adama?  Oh goody.Okay, I got that off my chest - now for the reason I wanted to write a review.  I'm a skier, and there are a few things that would have absolutely delighted me.  Since there was a major scene in a ski lodge, it would have made perfect sense for the characters to have ridden some snow on their way to the objective.  Picture it: three badasses getting all XXX on the slopes while being pursued by cylons on skis, who are, get this, cruising down the mountain at 60 MPH in a power wedge.  So great.  It was awesome that they portrayed the fabled snow snake (something we joke about with kids when they fall, that a snow snake grabbed their ski) - but man, cylons on skis, maybe built right into their bodies, would have made my day.  Picture them catching huge air while firing on the humans.  Pew pew pew!  And then wrecking into flaming chunks!  LOL!  Yard sale flambe!  It's not like this humorous diversion would have detracted from all the psychological profundity that was missing.Sidebar: Snowmageddon was also ruined by - in addition to the entire plot and all the special effects - the lack of awesome snowriding shots.  Seriously, a movie set in a resort town with world-class snowboarders as characters, and one pathetic shot of laddering is all we get??

It has good effects, reasonably good actors, and is a tightly told story.But in the context of the regular BG series, overall it seems a little shallow.  It's essentially BG re-imagined for a young male adult audience (18-23 year olds) (playing up the military experience, young men proving themselves, a (very) little sex and a lot of explosions).  The story isn't bad - it makes a nice prelude to BG in its way, and also references the spin-off series Caprica.  The plot is pretty good but suffers a little from having been broken into bite-size chunks due to its being originally formatted as a web series.Are these things bad?  Not necessarily. The unusual pacing (due to the webisode story story structure) is a little jarring at first, but once you get into it it's fine. The producers know their audience, and tailored Blood and Chrome effectively to that demographic.  Like the title implies, there's lots of fighting and testosterone.  I would say if you're young, and a guy, and can relate to the ""young man goes to war"" fantasy elements, you'll probably enjoy it... what's not to like?  If you're female, and/or older, you may find it less engaging, lacking in some of the more subtle and disturbing elements that made Battlestar Galactica such an effective commentary on the human condition, and so interesting to watch.",4,Mixed feelings about Blood and Chrome.,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,1514,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'Considered', 'thing', 'forgetting', 'moment', 'connections', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'like', 'respect', 'good', 'effects', 'reasonably', 'good', 'actors', 'tightly', 'told', 'story.But', 'context', 'regular', 'BG', 'series', 'overall', 'little', 'shallow', 'essentially', 'BG', 're-imagined', 'young', 'male', 'adult', 'audience', '18-23', 'year', 'olds', 'playing', 'up', 'military', 'experience', 'young', 'men', 'proving', 'very', 'little', 'sex', 'lot', 'explosions', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'nice', 'prelude', 'BG', 'way', 'also', 'spin-off', 'series', 'Caprica', 'plot', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'having', 'been', 'broken', 'bite-size', 'chunks', 'due', 'being', 'originally', 'formatted', 'web', 'series.Are', 'things', 'bad', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'unusual', 'pacing', 'due', 'webisode', 'story', 'story', 'structure', 'little', 'jarring', 'first', 'once', 'get', 'fine', 'producers', 'know', 'audience', 'tailored', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'effectively', 'demographic', 'title', 'implies', 'lots', 'fighting', 'testosterone', 'would', 'say', ""'re"", 'young', 'guy', 'can', 'relate', 'young', 'man', 'war', 'fantasy', 'elements', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'what', 'not', 'like', ""'re"", 'female', 'and/or', 'older', 'may', 'find', 'less', 'engaging', 'lacking', 'more', 'subtle', 'disturbing', 'elements', 'made', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'effective', 'commentary', 'human', 'condition', 'so', 'interesting', 'watch']",Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome

Many viewers felt that performances were flat and appearances were off when actors simply moved in front of a greenscreen.  Somehow, the result felt as flat as a weather report.  Since all the physical sets for BSG II were struck and sold off years ago, everything in Blood and Chrome would have to be done in prequel fashion - all against a greenscreen.Hmm... caveat three:  Many viewers compare Blood and Chrome's geeky young Adama unfavorably with the husky Husker shown in Razor years ago.  They point out that impetuous young pilots are a cliche.  True and true, but remember that Blood and Chrome features Adama senior on his first mission out of the Academy.  His physical and emotional type is therefore apt.Some hate the ""video game feel"" of Blood and Chrome.  Indeed, Blood and Chrome was originally meant to BE a video game, but just grew and grew.So how can I like it?  Let me tell you.First, the look:  I hated the hastily-constructed sets of the second series with a passion.  They lacked detail and texture.  Since the premise involved humanity eschewing computerization due to the possibility of Cylon infiltration, all that glorious ""electronic wallpaper"" that ol' sci-fi consumers like me like simply wasn't there.  In Blood and Chrome, the effects designers weren't constrained by physical or budgetary constraints on sets.  The wartime hanger bay and bridge are feasts for the eyes, making the second series' sets seem even more wretched in comparison.Second, the plot emphasis:  BSG - in any iteration - should be a war story, not a prime-time soap opera.  The endless exposition of the second series, leavened only with a small sprinkle of nice exterior effects shots here and there, is reversed here.  This is wall-to-wall action.  If your preferred entertainment is to see endless human/human, human/Cylon, and Cylon/Cylon bickering (the holy ""conflict"" espoused by embittered Trek expatriates like Moore), it is not central here.  Don't worry; there's plenty of moral ambiguity in Blood and Chrome, but it's not virtually the only thing.  An extended dogfight inside a space wreck does feel ""gamey,"" but many a good film adaptation feels ""stagey;"" it doesn't ruin the entertainment value of the film.Third, the antagonism between the sexes in Blood and Chrome is more tolerable than in the second series.  There is better balance here, with no Starbuckette chewing the scenery.  Inevitably, there is a flitting appearance by a proto-Number Six, mouthing her holier-than-thou's, but not enough to ruin the recipe.So if your tastes are like mine, enjoy.  If not, just pop the second series into the player and have some ice cream.",5,Now this is more like it!,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,2934,"['hated', 'BSG', 'remake', 'Razor', 'was', 'nice', 'separate', 'effort', 'generally', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'there', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'second', 'BSG', 'series', 'reader', 'caveat', 'one.Caveat', 'two', 'smoking', 'crater', 'left', 'behind', 'Lucas', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'Yes', 'must', 'Many', 'viewers', 'felt', 'performances', 'were', 'flat', 'appearances', 'were', 'off', 'when', 'actors', 'simply', 'moved', 'front', 'greenscreen', 'Somehow', 'result', 'felt', 'as', 'flat', 'weather', 'report', 'physical', 'sets', 'BSG', 'II', 'were', 'struck', 'sold', 'off', 'years', 'ago', 'everything', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'done', 'prequel', 'fashion', 'greenscreen.Hmm', 'caveat', 'three', 'Many', 'viewers', 'compare', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'geeky', 'young', 'Adama', 'unfavorably', 'husky', 'Husker', 'shown', 'Razor', 'years', 'ago', 'point', 'out', 'impetuous', 'young', 'pilots', 'are', 'cliche', 'True', 'true', 'remember', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'features', 'Adama', 'senior', 'first', 'mission', 'Academy', 'physical', 'emotional', 'type', 'therefore', 'apt.Some', 'hate', 'video', 'game', 'feel', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'Indeed', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'was', 'originally', 'meant', 'BE', 'video', 'game', 'just', 'grew', 'grew.So', 'how', 'can', 'like', 'Let', 'tell', 'you.First', 'look', 'hated', 'hastily-constructed', 'sets', 'second', 'series', 'passion', 'lacked', 'detail', 'texture', 'premise', 'involved', 'humanity', 'eschewing', 'computerization', 'due', 'possibility', 'Cylon', 'infiltration', 'glorious', 'electronic', 'wallpaper', 'ol', 'sci-fi', 'consumers', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'effects', 'designers', 'were', ""n't"", 'constrained', 'physical', 'budgetary', 'constraints', 'sets', 'wartime', 'hanger', 'bay', 'bridge', 'are', 'feasts', 'eyes', 'making', 'second', 'series', 'sets', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'wretched', 'comparison.Second', 'plot', 'emphasis', 'BSG', 'iteration', 'should', 'be', 'war', 'story', 'not', 'prime-time', 'soap', 'opera', 'endless', 'exposition', 'second', 'series', 'leavened', 'only', 'small', 'sprinkle', 'nice', 'exterior', 'effects', 'shots', 'here', 'there', 'reversed', 'here', 'wall-to-wall', 'action', 'preferred', 'entertainment', 'see', 'endless', 'human/human', 'human/Cylon', 'Cylon/Cylon', 'bickering', 'holy', 'conflict', 'espoused', 'embittered', 'Trek', 'Moore', 'not', 'central', 'here', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'plenty', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'not', 'virtually', 'only', 'thing', 'extended', 'dogfight', 'space', 'wreck', 'feel', 'gamey', 'many', 'good', 'film', 'adaptation', 'stagey', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film.Third', 'antagonism', 'sexes', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'more', 'tolerable', 'second', 'series', 'better', 'balance', 'here', 'Starbuckette', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'Inevitably', 'flitting', 'appearance', 'proto-Number', 'Six', 'mouthing', 'holier-than-thou', 'not', 'enough', 'ruin', 'recipe.So', 'tastes', 'are', 'mine', 'enjoy', 'not', 'just', 'pop', 'second', 'series', 'player', 'have', 'ice', 'cream']",Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome

The Unrated cut also includes some extra choice swear words, such as a-hole and s---.  In summary, it's a much tamer unrated cut than unrated BSG DVDs that SyFy has previously released.(1) When Adama, Coker, and Dr. Kelly first come aboard the Osiris, they are treat hostilely by Commander Ozar's 2nd in command (played by Ty Olsson, formerly Captain Kelly on BSG:RDM) and his Marines.(2)  Adama sleeps with Dr. Kelly but nothing explicit is shown, minus some shedding of clothes.(3)  Coker attempts conversation with Toth, who proves to be quite the misanthrope.I thoroughly enjoyed the prequel and it's a godsdanged motherfrakkin' shame that SyFy decided to sit on it for so long and air quality programming like Ghost Hunters instead.  Luke Pasqualino as the cocky, young Adama and Ben Cotton as the war-weary Coker played off each other nicely, even though there was lessened tension from viewers knowing that Adama obviously survives the First Cylon War.  B&C; writers still managed some interesting twists in the storyline.It was nice being reunited with beautiful CGI shots of starship battles (the Viper/Raider sub-atmospheric battle over Djerba was a visual treat) and Bear McCreary's hauntingly familiar score.  Some of the CGI shots of the Galactica's bridge clearly looked green screened, but not bad considering that the BSG sets had already been torn down at the time of filming B&C.;Frak Caprica.

After that, I was choking on season 3,4 & Caprica.I want to start off with my beloved bucket.....THE GALACTICA herself. They had two versions of her in Blood & Chrome. Two different crews desigend their own version. WTF? The first version was awesome, but you could tell it was incomplete. The first 4 to 6 batteries they show from the aft topside looked to small and you could see they didnt look apart of Galactica. Then they put 2 batteries over where the nukes should have been. Those who know battships know there shouldnt be batteries over the bridges that connect the flight pods to the mainship. STILL, IT LOOKED INTIMIDATING. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS MODEL.Now the second version was designed by someone who doesnt unerstand the design & armor thickness of a warship and the excessive consentration of batteries placed in one area. The head of the Galictica.Anyway, enough of that.William 'Bill' Adama aka HUSKER. Now if you know Edward James Olmos, you know why he's named HUSKER. Now in 'Razor' Nico Cortez was a perfect fit playing the younger Adama. This kid playing Adama now is no 'HUSKER', HE JUST DIDNT FIT. HOW DOES RAZOR + BLOME & CHROME EXPLAIN Admiral Adamas background? The BSG ALUMNI did a great job. LSO Cpt. Kelly, NARCHO, Spl. Gage, KAG Capt Taylor, Sgt. Hadrian did a great job.

I guess they call it creative marketing cause that is the only thing they seem good at as they give up any good show even before it can be taken to the next level.However, this would be a great jump off point to go from series to mini-series which this Galactica franchise seems able to do periodically with flying colors and maybe they would be better off going that route as they advance this particular story line.But I suppose this will be another one of those not so continuous affair because the producers can't seem to be willing to stick with it.

Altho you can watch it bit by bit on line, it'll be far more fun to own the DVD, since the extra scenes often made Battlestar Galactica DVDs far more interesting, and complete. Also producer/developer/writer Ron's video commentary could be used for a college class in creative writing, since he's always revealing more than just dropped scenes and insider banter, but insights into his creative process. As for the film itself, its impressive. The computer graphics are along the line of PROMETHEUS. THe camerawork include a lot of bright lights shining into the lense, for realistic atmosphere, as well as outrageous futuristic technology. From the first moments of a viper battle, thru the latest technology inside the Battlestar, the residue of Battlestars in a battlefield in space, right up to the creepiest cylon creature yet, the film is a visual feast.
