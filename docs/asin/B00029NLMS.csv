True, there are quasi-sequels to the Trinity series, some even consider ""The Fight Before Christmas"" (1994) to be the ""third"" Trinity film, however, even though the film starred Terence Hill and Bud Spencer they were not playing Trinity or Bambino. Oddly it is this film lacking even a cameo by Hill or Spencer and produced a year after ""Fight"" that best captures the Trinity spirit.Perhaps it is because the director, Enzo Barboni, also directed the original two Trinity films. According to an interview with Hill, Barboni long ago had an idea for a third Trinity film called ""And They Insist Upon Calling Him Trinity."" It is debatable whether or not any of Barboni's ideas for that film ended up in this one, but the humor is true to the Trinity plot format and style.The actor portraying the son of Trinity actually looks (and sounds depending upon the dubber) like Terence Hill. Bambino doesn't look exactly like Bud Spencer, but he's still got a good look and way of grunting that fits the part. As an added bonus, several of the original actors from the first two Trinity films appear in this, in some cases portraying the same characters (such as the Mexican Bandits).No, this isn't as good as the original Trinity films, but its a darned good effort!",4,"The only ""official"" sequel to Trinity is Still my Name",1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,1330,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'sequel', 'Trinity', 'Still', 'My', 'Name', 'True', 'are', 'quasi-sequels', 'Trinity', 'series', 'even', 'consider', 'Fight', 'Christmas', '1994', 'be', 'third', 'Trinity', 'film', 'however', 'even', 'film', 'starred', 'Terence', 'Hill', 'Bud', 'Spencer', 'were', 'not', 'playing', 'Trinity', 'Bambino', 'Oddly', 'film', 'lacking', 'even', 'cameo', 'Hill', 'Spencer', 'produced', 'year', 'Fight', 'best', 'Trinity', 'spirit.Perhaps', 'director', 'Enzo', 'Barboni', 'also', 'directed', 'original', 'two', 'Trinity', 'films', 'According', 'interview', 'Hill', 'Barboni', 'long', 'ago', 'had', 'idea', 'third', 'Trinity', 'film', 'called', 'Insist', 'Calling', 'Him', 'Trinity', 'debatable', 'not', 'Barboni', 'ideas', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'humor', 'true', 'Trinity', 'plot', 'format', 'style.The', 'actor', 'portraying', 'son', 'Trinity', 'actually', 'depending', 'dubber', 'Terence', 'Hill', 'Bambino', ""n't"", 'look', 'exactly', 'Bud', 'Spencer', 'still', 'got', 'good', 'look', 'way', 'grunting', 'part', 'added', 'bonus', 'several', 'original', 'actors', 'first', 'two', 'Trinity', 'films', 'appear', 'cases', 'portraying', 'same', 'characters', 'such', 'Mexican', 'Bandits', '.No', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Trinity', 'films', 'darned', 'good', 'effort']",N/A

Terrence Hill and Bud Spenser made them so. That made a ""son's of"" movie a dangerous prospect. Could a new cast of characters recapture the hilarity?They do. Two unknowns play the parts of the sons of Trinity and Bambino and capture their mannerisms well. They clean up a western town, right the wrongs and pick up the laughs. The quality of the film is improved as well. It works.Many of the situations are frankly absurd. That is part of what makes it funny.
