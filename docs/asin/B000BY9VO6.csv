952482,A5FBTQE8QFWFQ,B000BY9VO6,"Avid Fan ""David""","[9, 9]",Guys look I know that by the reviews that the movie is not like the manga anime series but for what it is the movie is a fun action comedy that you can enjoy. Aleast you don't have to dramatize it into a life or death situaition like the Fast and Furious series has beeen doing. This has cool racing scenes and sweet cars doing the best drifting i've ever seen. And not to mention the comidic side of this story works and Anthony Wong is the man. If you hate this movie just because it did not stay true to the anime then you are being unfair to this movie. This is a fun film to watch and you will find it refreshing to see as Initial D will take you to the wildest drift of your life.,5,D rocks,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,686,"['Guys', 'look', 'know', 'reviews', 'movie', 'not', 'manga', 'anime', 'series', 'what', 'movie', 'fun', 'action', 'comedy', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Aleast', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dramatize', 'life', 'death', 'situaition', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'series', 'beeen', 'doing', 'cool', 'racing', 'scenes', 'sweet', 'cars', 'doing', 'best', 'drifting', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'mention', 'comidic', 'side', 'story', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'man', 'hate', 'movie', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'stay', 'true', 'anime', 'then', 'are', 'being', 'unfair', 'movie', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'will', 'find', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Initial', 'D', 'will', 'take', 'wildest', 'drift', 'life']",Initial D

952485,A2V7EO331SFUF6,B000BY9VO6,D.B. Spalding,"[0, 0]","As a youth drama, it works. As an action flick, it works. As a racing movie, it had me holding my breath. I grew up with films like BULLITT and LE MANS, where the directors had to get you IN the cars with the drivers to ratchet up the suspense. Lau does that here.The sly humor with Wong and Chou's interactions, and the boasting kid whose dad owns a gas station, always leave me laughing, even after my fourth viewing.But what really grabs me in this film is the phenomenal 5/6 track soundtrack. During a few scenes, with your home theater fully ramped up, you can hear cars growling around the snakelike mountain roads, weaving in and out of view, the headlights playing peek-a-boo through the trees, and the sound peeping in and out of all the channels in your speaker setup. It can be an eerie, moving experience, and for my money better illustrates the thrill of driving the sports cars down this mountain in the story than any CGI does. It's that good.The film is polished to a high shine. It got me interested in Lau's other films, just as stylish and memorable. Definitely getting the Blu-Ray of this.",5,"Great direction, dripping with style, superb sound, and a involving story",1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,1109,"['youth', 'drama', 'action', 'flick', 'racing', 'movie', 'had', 'holding', 'breath', 'grew', 'up', 'films', 'BULLITT', 'LE', 'MANS', 'where', 'directors', 'had', 'get', 'IN', 'cars', 'drivers', 'ratchet', 'up', 'suspense', 'Lau', 'here.The', 'sly', 'humor', 'Wong', 'Chou', 'interactions', 'boasting', 'kid', 'dad', 'gas', 'station', 'always', 'leave', 'laughing', 'even', 'fourth', 'viewing.But', 'what', 'really', 'grabs', 'film', 'phenomenal', '5/6', 'track', 'soundtrack', 'few', 'scenes', 'home', 'theater', 'fully', 'ramped', 'up', 'can', 'hear', 'cars', 'growling', 'snakelike', 'mountain', 'roads', 'weaving', 'view', 'headlights', 'playing', 'peek-a-boo', 'trees', 'sound', 'peeping', 'channels', 'speaker', 'setup', 'can', 'be', 'eerie', 'moving', 'experience', 'money', 'better', 'thrill', 'driving', 'sports', 'cars', 'down', 'mountain', 'story', 'CGI', 'good.The', 'film', 'polished', 'high', 'shine', 'got', 'interested', 'Lau', 'other', 'films', 'just', 'stylish', 'memorable', 'Definitely', 'getting', 'Blu-Ray']",Initial D

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","When word came out that INITIAL D was being made into the live movie, I was very anxious.Knowing that directors Andrew Lau Wai-Keung and Alan Mak Siu-Fai would be directing this film (especially since their collaboration has led to the critically acclaimed film INFERNAL AFFAIRS),  this film had a great chance to be adapted correctly from its anime and manga bretheren.The main hype of this film was because of the main star, popular singer Jay Chou who would be playing the main character of Takumi.The reviews of the film from reviewers throughout Asia was 50/50.  Many who had no knowledge of the anime or film and simply hated the fact that Jay Chou's character was the way it was and many felt his acting was just wooden.Many felt that the film featured too much on car racing and thus, those who got it and knew what INITIAL D and also have watched many Hong Kong films respected the film for what its worth.I enjoyed the film.  I was excited when I watched it and when it ended, I wanted more.Was it faithful to the anime or manga?  I think the directors did very well with the film, capturing the geekiness of Takumi's friends and the racing was just fun to watch.I enjoyed the fact that there were a lot of HK stars who participated in this film and with the DTS soundtrack, enjoyed the sound of the engine roaring all over my speakers.But I'm an INITIAL D fan, I'm also a Jay Chou music fan and I like watching cars race and drift.But since Initial D focuses a lot on the racing, this is going to turn many viewers off who are not into it.Oh well.  I enjoyed it.The DVD features a making of featurette, deleted scenes, outttakes, photo gallery, TV spots and trailers and promotionals done in Shanghai and Japan.  As well as several Easter eggs.Video is anamorphic Widescreen 2:35:1 and for audio a DTS-ES and Dolby Digital EX Surround tracks are available.All in all, if you are open to something new and have an interest in import racing, I say give INITIAL D a chance.

I've watched this HK adaptation of Initial D twice, first time without any knowledge of the original manga and anime, and second time recently after I'd watched all the free episodes of the anime series on Hulu. The first time I watched this movie I thought the car stunts were great -- I had been a fan of the Ridge Racer games so I was familiar with drifting -- but hated the cast. Understandably so, I liked the film even less the 2nd time around. The natural coolness of Takumi is just not there, and Anthony Wang's rendition of Bunta is completely trash (even though the Euroasian Wang is an otherwise excellent actor). The Japanese supporting cast is amateurish, including Anne Suzuki as Mogi. (The only bearable guy is the Kyouichi character.) There is no chemistry between any of the characters, and the changes in plot were frustrating to watch after I'd seen the anime. Still, I decided to give this 2 stars because the car stunts, performed mostly by the Takahashi Racing Team (owned by a guy surnamed Takahashi, like Ryosuke and Keisuke!), are just incredible. I especially love the three-car race at the end and wonder how they coordinated the sequence... For the drifting stunts alone and only for the drifting stunts alone, this is a worthy movie for racing fans to watch and own.",2,"Great car stunts, but very poor casting",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,1316,"['love', 'racing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'HK', 'adaptation', 'Initial', 'D', 'twice', 'first', 'time', 'knowledge', 'original', 'manga', 'anime', 'second', 'time', 'recently', ""'d"", 'watched', 'free', 'episodes', 'anime', 'series', 'Hulu', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'car', 'stunts', 'were', 'great', 'had', 'been', 'fan', 'Ridge', 'Racer', 'games', 'so', 'was', 'familiar', 'drifting', 'hated', 'cast', 'Understandably', 'so', 'liked', 'film', 'even', 'less', '2nd', 'time', 'around', 'natural', 'coolness', 'Takumi', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'Anthony', 'Wang', 'rendition', 'Bunta', 'completely', 'trash', 'even', 'Euroasian', 'Wang', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'actor', 'Japanese', 'supporting', 'cast', 'amateurish', 'including', 'Anne', 'Suzuki', 'Mogi', 'only', 'bearable', 'guy', 'Kyouichi', 'character', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'changes', 'plot', 'were', 'frustrating', 'watch', ""'d"", 'seen', 'anime', 'Still', 'decided', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'car', 'stunts', 'performed', 'mostly', 'Takahashi', 'Racing', 'Team', 'owned', 'guy', 'surnamed', 'Takahashi', 'Ryosuke', 'Keisuke', 'are', 'just', 'incredible', 'especially', 'love', 'three-car', 'race', 'end', 'wonder', 'how', 'coordinated', 'sequence', 'drifting', 'stunts', 'alone', 'only', 'drifting', 'stunts', 'alone', 'worthy', 'movie', 'racing', 'fans', 'watch', 'own']",Initial D
952489,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000BY9VO6,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 6]","""Initial D"" is a fairly good film.  With about 5 separate car races and numerous flashbacks where the same footage is repeated in montages, the film does tend to drag a bit.Jay Chou plays the teenage Takumi whose stoic facial expressions as a tofu delivery boy get punctured by love.  Chou did much of the music in the film; and we see fancy footwork on the car pedals as he jams into gear around the curves.  He gets some nice reaction shots after his romantic breakup.  Chou followed this, his first film, with ""Curse of the Yellow Flower.""Anthony Wong who was recently in ""The Painted Veil"" plays his alcoholic father who is an ex-racer but who has spiraled downhill since the loss of his wife.  He keeps passing out, but he knows how to outfit a tofu delivery car.  After repeated threats to knock his son around, it was a wink that let his son know how much his dad loves him.  With a cigarette dangling, Wong plays the perfect vagabond.Anne Suzuki who was in ""Moon Child"" & ""Snow Falling Cedars"" plays Natsuki.  She seems to be a normal high school girl who develops a crush on Takumi.  However, we soon find that the uncle who takes care of her is an older guy who uses her for physical pleasure at the ""Love Hotel.""  Obviously, this causes some problems in her relationship with Takumi who is her true love.  Suzuki seemed far too nice and innocent to believably play a lady of the evening (or in her case afternoon), but she does a good job with the innocent love in the film.Chapman To who was so good in ""Six Strong Characters"" plays the heavy-set Itsuki, best friend of Takumi.  His father owns the service station at which Takumi works.  To is the comic relief of the picture, mugging, full of bravado one moment and vomiting by the curb from carsickness the next.  Kenny Bee does a nice job as Itsuki's father, owner of the service station.Edison Chen who was in ""Gen Y-Cops"" does a good job as being the other independent racer who tries to take out the professional in the climactic final race.  The race sequences, mostly at night, are well filmed and keep you glued to the screen.  While there may be a few too many of them, overall this is a good movie that grabs your attention and makes you care about its characters.

952490,A1NN2Y8GYCNYGV,B000BY9VO6,R. Caymo,"[2, 2]","Since nobody has reviewed the Blu-ray transfer, I might as well.  I will start off by saying that I have this on DVD as well and this review will be based in comparison to it in terms of video/audio quality.At first I was a bit skeptical about this one, I am not too familiar with studios doing transfers from over seas.  But just wow, this video transfer is definitely a step up from the DVD!  The clarity and color is just superb and it was definitely a joy to watch again.  You can actually see the detail in skin tones (like most great transfers) and during the races  it pretty crystal clear to keep up with the action.  My only gripe about the transfer is that some scenes are a hit and miss.  Like you can catch some noise in some scenes (most notably in the Gas Station scenes) and BLACKS are sometimes crushing (most notably during in-car scenes at night).Sorry but I am still running a standard 5.1 DD and in terms of the audio quality its nearly identical to the DVD's 5.1 DD.  If anyone gets to test the Cantonese LPCM let me know how it turns out!  I actually watched this movie in English DD and the dubbing is so-so as expected but fitting.All in all if you are a fellow Blu-ray enthusiast, I actually would recommend this one and being at 19.00 smacks, its actually worth more than that sitting nicely in your collection.TESTED ON:Sony Playstation 3Sony Bravia KDL40v2500 (1080p)Harman Kardon AVR146 with Polk Surrounds and MTX SW2",5,[Blu-ray] Review,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,1447,"['nobody', 'reviewed', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'have', 'DVD', 'well', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'based', 'comparison', 'terms', 'video/audio', 'quality.At', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'one', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'familiar', 'studios', 'doing', 'transfers', 'seas', 'just', 'wow', 'video', 'transfer', 'definitely', 'step', 'up', 'DVD', 'clarity', 'color', 'just', 'superb', 'was', 'definitely', 'joy', 'watch', 'again', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'detail', 'skin', 'tones', 'most', 'great', 'transfers', 'races', 'pretty', 'crystal', 'clear', 'keep', 'up', 'action', 'only', 'gripe', 'transfer', 'scenes', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'can', 'catch', 'noise', 'scenes', 'most', 'notably', 'Gas', 'Station', 'scenes', 'BLACKS', 'are', 'sometimes', 'crushing', 'most', 'notably', 'in-car', 'scenes', 'night', '.Sorry', 'am', 'still', 'running', 'standard', '5.1', 'DD', 'terms', 'audio', 'quality', 'nearly', 'identical', 'DVD', '5.1', 'DD', 'anyone', 'test', 'Cantonese', 'LPCM', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'out', 'actually', 'watched', 'movie', 'English', 'DD', 'dubbing', 'so-so', 'expected', 'fitting.All', 'are', 'fellow', 'Blu-ray', 'enthusiast', 'actually', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'being', '19.00', 'smacks', 'actually', 'more', 'sitting', 'nicely', 'collection.TESTED', 'ON', 'Sony', 'Playstation', '3Sony', 'Bravia', 'KDL40v2500', '1080p', 'Harman', 'Kardon', 'AVR146', 'Polk', 'Surrounds', 'MTX', 'SW2']",Initial D
952491,A2S0UXAWV52WZ2,B000BY9VO6,"Steven Fujita ""Steven Fujita, author of &#34;...","[2, 2]","I'm not a car fan, nor a racing fan, but when I stumbled upon the anime, I loved it. So, even though I knew the live action film wouldn't be the same, I still looked forward to seeing it.  As I have never read the manga, any comparisons I make are between the anime and the live action versions.Like any movie that is adapted from another souce, they made changes, some significant - Bunta, Takumi's father is a womanizing alcoholic who abuses his son, and Itsuki is a braggard,, rather than the nerdy side kick - both revisions did not appeal to me. On the other hand, Jay Chou, who plays Takumi, did an excellent job of projecting the personality of the character in the anime, and which is part of the appeal for the story - a kid who doesn't know or like cars is a better racer than those obsessed by cars - and then finds focus in his life by racing.I think the problem with this film is that it tries to do too much.  This is worse for viewers familiar with the anime or manga because character and racing development takes place in leaps, rather than steps.  Even for viewers who come in with no knowledge of the characters, sometimes you wonder where they are coming from - and basically, I think it comes from trying to imitate the major points from the original story without spending the time to develop it.  On the other hand, the movie does revise characters' personalities and histories, so it is also trying to add some original touches. In the end, the movie is neither original, nor a faithful adaptation for the hard-core anime fans.For me, the movie itself is a two star rating, but might be a 2 1/2 for those who give higher priority to visual racing scenes, or three for those not familiar with the anime - but as far as the Amazon rating stars, it still gets two because, as other reviews have stated, those trailers in the beginning are really annoying.  Not only did I spend some extra time trying to skip past the trailers, but when the movie finally started, I realized that I forgot to set the sub-titles and had to sit through the trailers again. If you are going to watch this movie, make sure to see it in one sitting - it's just not worth having to sit through the trailers just to get to the movie and then getting to the point you left off at.",2,Clear Your Mind of the Anime Before Watching,1242432000,"05 16, 2009",2009,2276,"[""'m"", 'not', 'car', 'fan', 'racing', 'fan', 'when', 'stumbled', 'anime', 'loved', 'So', 'even', 'knew', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'still', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'manga', 'comparisons', 'make', 'are', 'anime', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'adapted', 'souce', 'made', 'changes', 'significant', 'Bunta', 'Takumi', 'father', 'womanizing', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'son', 'Itsuki', 'braggard', 'rather', 'nerdy', 'side', 'kick', 'revisions', 'did', 'not', 'appeal', 'other', 'hand', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'who', 'Takumi', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'projecting', 'personality', 'character', 'anime', 'part', 'appeal', 'story', 'kid', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'cars', 'better', 'racer', 'obsessed', 'cars', 'then', 'focus', 'life', 'racing.I', 'think', 'problem', 'film', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'worse', 'viewers', 'familiar', 'anime', 'manga', 'character', 'racing', 'development', 'place', 'leaps', 'rather', 'steps', 'Even', 'viewers', 'who', 'come', 'knowledge', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'basically', 'think', 'trying', 'imitate', 'major', 'points', 'original', 'story', 'spending', 'time', 'develop', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'revise', 'characters', 'personalities', 'histories', 'also', 'trying', 'add', 'original', 'touches', 'end', 'movie', 'original', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'hard-core', 'anime', 'fans.For', 'movie', 'two', 'star', 'rating', 'might', 'be', '2', '1/2', 'who', 'give', 'higher', 'priority', 'visual', 'racing', 'scenes', 'three', 'not', 'familiar', 'anime', 'as', 'far', 'Amazon', 'rating', 'stars', 'still', 'two', 'because', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'stated', 'trailers', 'beginning', 'are', 'really', 'annoying', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'spend', 'extra', 'time', 'trying', 'skip', 'trailers', 'when', 'movie', 'finally', 'started', 'realized', 'forgot', 'set', 'sub-titles', 'had', 'sit', 'trailers', 'again', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'make', 'sure', 'see', 'one', 'sitting', 'just', 'not', 'worth', 'having', 'sit', 'trailers', 'just', 'get', 'movie', 'then', 'getting', 'point', 'left', 'off']",Initial D

I was so pissed off by that, that by the time it let me start the movie, I just could NOT find a way to enjoy it.An hour into the movie, I stopped it and found something else to do.  I didn't try to finish watching it until at least a week later (after, of course, doing something else while the 10 minutes of unskippable previews played out).  But I was still so burned about that abrasive form of advertising that I still couldn't get into it.To this day, every time I hear ""Initial D"" the first thing that springs into my mind is how pissed off that DVD makes me.  I like to watch movie trailers, but only AFTER I've watched the feature presentation, NOT EVERY BLOODY TIME I SIMIPLY LOAD THE DVD!Oh, and as for the movie itself, another thing that annoyed me was the language select.  When watching foreign films, I prefer listening to the original language.  Being a 2005 Hong Kong film, you'd think it were Cantonese, but I couldn't figure out whether it was supposed to be Cantonese or Mandarin.  I later found out this is one of those films where the actors all speak their mother tongues, then the final production is dubbed at whichever scenes don't match the target language.  Silly me, I tried cycling through the language channels when *Japanese* actors were talking (there is no Japanese Audio on the U.S. DVD), so of course I never found the channel that sync'd right.  (I did later find out that Cantonese is the ""main"" language.)I'm not sure if I'll ever bother trying to watch this again.  Aside from the annoyance of having to wait through 10 minutes of previews every time I want to watch the movie, I didn't find the story very interesting.  I'm not a car-guy, so I'm not easily captivated by watching people compete to see who can be the fastest jerk on the road without breaking the tofu.  (I'd rather just play Carmageddon.)",1,Poor Marketing,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,2037,"['DVD', 'be', 'started', '10', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'actually', 'ready', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'THERE', 'ARE', '10', 'MINUTES', 'OF', 'PREVIEWS', 'WHICH', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'SKIP', 'OR', 'FAST', 'FORWARD', 'was', 'so', 'pissed', 'off', 'time', 'let', 'start', 'movie', 'just', 'could', 'NOT', 'find', 'way', 'enjoy', 'it.An', 'hour', 'movie', 'stopped', 'found', 'something', 'else', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'finish', 'watching', 'least', 'week', 'later', 'course', 'doing', 'something', 'else', '10', 'minutes', 'unskippable', 'previews', 'played', 'out', 'was', 'still', 'so', 'burned', 'abrasive', 'form', 'advertising', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.To', 'day', 'time', 'hear', 'Initial', 'D', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'how', 'pissed', 'off', 'DVD', 'like', 'watch', 'movie', 'trailers', 'only', 'AFTER', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'feature', 'presentation', 'NOT', 'EVERY', 'BLOODY', 'TIME', 'SIMIPLY', 'LOAD', 'THE', 'DVD', 'Oh', 'movie', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'was', 'language', 'select', 'When', 'watching', 'foreign', 'films', 'prefer', 'listening', 'original', 'language', 'Being', '2005', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', ""'d"", 'think', 'were', 'Cantonese', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Cantonese', 'Mandarin', 'later', 'found', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'actors', 'speak', 'mother', 'tongues', 'then', 'final', 'production', 'dubbed', 'whichever', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'target', 'language', 'Silly', 'tried', 'cycling', 'language', 'channels', 'when', '*Japanese*', 'actors', 'were', 'talking', 'Japanese', 'Audio', 'U.S.', 'DVD', 'so', 'course', 'never', 'found', 'channel', 'sync', ""'d"", 'right', 'did', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'Cantonese', 'main', 'language', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'bother', 'trying', 'watch', 'again', 'Aside', 'annoyance', 'having', 'wait', '10', 'minutes', 'previews', 'time', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'not', 'car-guy', ""'m"", 'not', 'easily', 'captivated', 'watching', 'people', 'compete', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'fastest', 'jerk', 'road', 'breaking', 'tofu', ""'d"", 'rather', 'just', 'play', 'Carmageddon']",Initial D
