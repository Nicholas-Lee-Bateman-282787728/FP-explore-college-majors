I don't believe neither of these movie are really good to be honest, acting performance is rather mediocre, and storyline very much boring. But I believe this young actor has potential, I find that he actually make the movie I am number four entertaining. In Beastly, he seems to be acting like he is in a Play, I don't really see him connecting with his character. I believe that he probably was not really comfortable with the role, something I like about his acting in number four is that he is effortless attractive. What I mean, is that he seems not to be that vain, his beauty doesn't distract me from his performance, he seems to behave like the boy next door, and that for me is what make him better over others actors. Is my opinion. In Beastly, he just seems not to fit in the role, the idea that there is a guy that will deliver a speech on how Good looking people are the leaders does not seems to fit really, and don't get to hate his behavior, I feel sorry that somebody actually is that silly to said that out loud.

Kyle/Hunter and Lindy characters weren't well developed in my opinion because they came across flat.  There were too many holes in the story plot such as why the relationship between Kyle/Hunter and his father is so strained, what happened to his mother, and what caused him to have such a ""superior"" attitude, not in a convencing way, about himself.  Lindy's relationship with her father wasn't fully explained in the movie, but the viewer can somewhat figure it out.

It just seemed like a good story... and I think it was. First, clocking in at 85 or so minutes, this movie books along. I also get the feeling some one edited it down to just bear bones and perhaps had a lot of re-shoots. But if you are going to take such a story, this is imho a good result.The story starts with Kyle Kingston, a rich, bratty, popular jerk who is full of himself -- at school anyway. At home you see that Kyle isn't all that bad. He is frustrated by his dad, an anchorman, who obviously doesn't love him (no mom or sibs) and taking out his anger on all around. You feel bad for him because, no one, at the start of this movie does love Kyle. Somehow Kyle chooses to be mean to the local witch (you get the feeling Kyle does it because he wants the result) and ends up with a spell making him - ugly. It can only be broken by someone saying ""I love you"" within one year. Kyle's life goes down hill rapidly, his dad puts him in a townhouse alone with a blind tutor and maid and all his school friends think he is in rehab or something.  Alone, he has time to think about things.Then comes Lindy, a former co-student of Kyle and the ""Beauty"" here. It is clear Lindy did have a crush on Kyle and for a brief moment there, prior to Kyle turning there was a spark of something from Kyle as well. Kyle decides that Lindy is his best shot and sets about wooing her. There is a very preposterous way that Kyle gets Lindy to live with him, but hey, that is tough to do in modern times. It didn't bother me that much.  How it ends up is pretty much what you might think.I thought it interesting that for the first time ever, Kyle is surrounded by people that do care about him, his tutor, and maid (Neil Patrick Harris and Lisa Hamilton) giving Kyle the support he needs to change. I thought it was clear that Kyle changed - making a deal with the witch at the end that she help the tutor and maid with their issues if he broke the spell. I like to think that the love Kyle gained her wasn't just Lindy's but the extended family he made over a year, with his tutor, maid, and Lindy all of who grew to love him and he them.

I gotta be honest though- as much as I may have eventually warmed up to it, I was NOT so receptive towards the really bad writing in the beginning.It's about an arrogant pretty boy played by Alex Pettyfer who believes he's unbelievably attractive to the point he can get away with disrespecting his female classmates, however after he makes a rude comment towards one of his female classmates who's apparently a witch of some kind (played by Mary Kate Olsen) she puts a spell on Alex that makes him ugly, completely changing not only his facial appearance but his personality and outlook on life (due to the fact he's stuck with his new appearance).  This is his punishment until he finds a girl to fall in love with, and then the spell will be erased.  This changes Alex's perception of the world in a dramatic way.  Not a bad concept, however there are a couple issues.One is the most obvious one that I already mention above- this is certainly a movie for teens, and not only that, it's rather lovey dovey for the most part, neglecting to include any kind of comedy or enticing drama.  It's all romance for the most part.  One thing I find odd is that, the girl he has a crush on (played by the VERY beautiful Vanessa Hudgens) happens to find herself in a dangerous situation one evening, and Alex comes to her rescue and basically threatens her father that she MUST live with Alex.  His explanation was unusual which results in a strange bit of flawed storytelling, I think.  While Vanessa is living with Alex Pettyfer, I think it's extremely obvious the two of them would inevitably fall in love.  I mean she's basically being held right THERE (without much of a struggle- another storyline flaw) in his house, so she's basically available right then.  Lousy writing.Other characters such as Neil Patrick Harris feel tacky and unnecessary, as does the maid (Lisa Hamilton).  This storyline probably could have succeeded without those characters.  Anyway Alex Pettfer turning into a respectable young man gradually as the storyline moves along is decent enough writing, and overall the movie just gets better and better (though predictably so, unfortunately) until its conclusion.  I do feel guilty giving this film such a high rating but it *did* keep me attached and that's what matters the most.  You can probably guess what happens at the end too.  Highly recommended.  Just avoid the really horrible first 15 minutes.

I think the transformation is intentional with the use of more eye shadow which makes him look even more malnourished and exhausted but is flattering.  He no longer looks extremely shocking.""Let me make those cheekbones even higher.""Do those mutilations on the main character's face and all over his body look familiar to you?  They would if you knew that the Japanese didn't just reserve their mutilation and science experiments to a single location in Northern China.  They tortured young beautiful English soldiers who were captured in Asia.  They fed them mercury hence the metal coming out of Alex Pettyfer's face, they burned them all over, they laughed as they stripped blonde eyebrows off to examine more closely and keep as key chain charms, it's WRITTEN all over Alex Pettyfer in this film.  The translucent skin of the Western Europeans especially the Irish where the tiniest veins are visible provided SPORT for the bored Japanese prison guards who decided they would try to trace the veins under the skin with RAZOR BLADES.  They did this to the POWs who were young and pretty and they did it to the Chinese who have strangely thin skin compared to the Japanese and Koreans.  They cut into the cheekbones and the bridge of the higher English nose and tried to strip the muscle off faces to see whether pretty white people had different muscles laid out and that's why he has TWO long red cut marks on his upper and lower cheeks and three lines exactly on the bridge of the nose. Woe to you if you were lovely to look at it and the Japanese came across you.  They wouldn't leave you alone.It's no coincidence.  The other POWs eyewitnessed this and they told anyone who would listen but our governments shut them up to keep the peace.  The Americans and Russians have photographs of the corpses they found and the other POWs drew pictures of these mutilated boys in their hidden papers.  And the Japanese photographed them.  The keepers of the archives in Japan and of course, Bass Mouth Akihito probably gloated when they took this evidence of their deeds out.

1300636,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B002ZG975Q,Crystal Starr Light,"[8, 9]","Beastly.  First it was a book based off the tale, Beauty and the Beast.  Then, when producers saw how much money it drew from the teen and tween crowd, it became a movie starring Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens.Kyle Kingston is a self-absorbed teenager, son of a similarly self-absorbed reporter.  He has been raised to admire two things in life: money and good looks.  When he upsets a witch, Kendra, he is cursed with being ugly and having to find someone to love him before the year is out.  Will Kyle find his true love or will he be ugly forever?I read the book back in March and my overall thoughts were this:""This book was a fun timewaster, but I think it could have been a lot better. I remember reading Robin McKinley'sBeautyand being enchanted; years later, I hunted down the book and bought it (and have plans to reread--eventually). But I just don't see this book lasting very long, not with the very specific culture references. And we all know how long culture trends and fads last...Now that I've read it, I think I'm probably going to sell it back; it's just not one of those books I want to keep on my shelf and reread. However, I do have plans to see the movie; hopefully, the movie will bring some new insights.""As you expect, the movie changes quite a bit, from the names of characters (""Adrian"" is now ""Hunter"", ""Magda"" is now ""Zola"", ""Kingsbury"" is now ""Kingston""), to the characters themselves (Sloan goes from being vapid to being just a girl downtrodden by her boyfriend), to some events (the final climax of the book is completely omitted).  Some of them make sense...and some don't.The characters range from meh to terrible.  Kyle just isn't as appealing as his book form.  Here, he makes a ludicrous speech for being elected to Environmental President.  Why would he do this?  Nothing in his personality suggests ""caring for the environment"".  Why couldn't he be elected student president?  Why do the instructors let him get away with such a silly speech?  ""Elect me because I'm beautiful and you aren't""?  Geesh.  Kyle, once afflicted with ugliness, doesn't attempt to change into a better person, a person who gets a grip on his new features by studying and getting interested in roses.  Instead, Kyle mopes around, stalking Linda until he is in love with her and THEN begins to change.  But even this change is almost non-existent--when he had no character before, other than ""I'm obsessed with looks"", it's hard to change into anything with depth.  Alex Pettifyr tries really hard in his performance, but when a lot of the character of Kyle is changed so that there really is nothing to work with, it's hard for him to succeed.Linda has changed from nerdy, plain girl to environmental freak (in name only--she doesn't bring her own coffee cup when getting coffee or any other attribute you might find in the someone promoting greenness), feed the homeless, gorgeous Vanessa Hudgens.  While she does have a spark of independence not shown in the book (such as the scene where her dad drops her off at Kyle's), overall, Linda is boring.  Even more boring than her book counterpart (which, if you read my review, means a lot).  And Vanessa does nothing to make it better.  At one point, she looks like a dead fish as Kyle tells a story about a mother elephant returning to where her dead elephant babies were (although, I will give her this: that story was a PAINFUL way to try to woo a woman!).Kendra the Witch looks nothing like her book counterpart.  In the book, she was fat (possibly with greasy hair and acne).  Casting Mary Kate as her did nothing to help it.  Mary Kate is far from ugly, even in the weird getup.  She didn't do terrible as Kendra, but Kendra's role was greatly reduced from the book, so it's hard to say.  She was a little bit overdramatic.  Will the Tutor is terribly underused.  Because Kyle doesn't want to study in this version, his existence is unnecessary.  Zola the Maid fairs better than her hugely stereotyped Magda.  I even liked how she *wasn't* someone that the book made her to be in the end.  Sloan morphs from popular girl to ""Oh, I'm not so bad, it was just my boyfriend that made me that way"".But the story is where the book really falls flat.  When you open to a scene where Kyle is running for president and his speech consists solely of ""Vote for me, I'm beautiful"", you know you have problems.  The basic outline is pretty much like the book: Kyle asks Kendra on a date to humiliate her, Kendra curses him, Kyle must find someone to love him.  In between, there are changes, both good and bad.I wasn't fond of how Linda and Kyle spoke and started ""clicking"" before he changed ""ugly"".  I didn't mind her having a crush on him (she did in the book), but if they had a connection before, it almost deadens the ""He has to learn to fall in love"" lesson.  And makes it look like he would have tried to date her anyway.I have no idea why Will was brought in.  Kyle wanted to learn in the book and asked his dad for a tutor.  Here, Will shows up and promptly does nothing for the rest of the movie.Having Kyle stalk Linda before he saves her from the drug dealers was stupid.  Does every teenaged romance have to have stalking now as a sign of love?  And the drug dealers' scene was horribly cheesy.  Although I will admit, it gave a better reason why Linda should stay with Kyle than the book did.Most of the ""chemistry"" between Kyle and Linda is very sketchy and awkward.I really hated how Kyle got into a hissy fit about Linda calling him ""a good friend"" and then refused to take her phone calls.  Uh, dude, she's trying to clarify your relationship.  You are *this close* to losing her.  Get over yourself and pick up the %^&*ing phone.The ""climax"" or end scene or whatever is so dull and boring, it is like dropping a brick on the floor.  *THUD*  Blah.  Whatever.I could probably go on like this forever (in fact, I wrote a nearly scene-by-scene rant, just to get it out of my system), but I think you get the point.  The movie is definitely not as good as the book (which isn't the best of books to begin with).  I do not recommend a viewing, unless you are a die-hard fan of Alex Pettyfer, Vanessa Hudgens, or Beauty and the Beast.  Or, you are bored and need to get to sleep.Brought to you by:*C.S.

It was as if someone had finally opened all the doors in Wallywood to the teeny-boppers with results you would expect. But the tenor and direction of the film changed for the better, and at least it kept me watching.Galactically gorgeous Kyle Kingston (galactically gorgeous Alex Pettyfer in the third film of his I have seen and somewhat enjoyed) is an arrogant, selfish and insanely hurtful little high school student. He prances around the school, reminding everyone how beautiful he is and how beautiful people are the only winners who count. Puke anytime you like at the pretense and lack of subtlety.After crossing Kendra (a marvelous Mary-Kate Olsen), a mysterious Goth witch who also attends his school, she curses him and he transforms into what I can only describe as this needle-head monster I recognize from some old stupid horror flick. Even with the attempt at fright makeup, Alex is gorgeous so what's the use! She says he has one year for someone to fall in love with him for the curse to be lifted - the rest you can basically imagine because it couldn't be worse than this film. A 'true' love interest in the form of hippie-tree-hugger-Ugly-Betty-wannabe Lindy (truly beautiful Disney prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Vanessa Hudgens), a blind tutor named Will (the always lovely Neil Patrick Harris) and a Jamaican housekeeper (Usagay Hamilton) round out the unnecessary cast.While I loved how the actors carried this awful film with a beautiful message, and the wonderful location of Qu&eacute;bec which added to the general stillness of the movie, I was irritated beyond words by the endless stream of whiny 'tween' music that makes such films nothing more than music videos. Also sorely lacking was a good writer; the direction was so-so. One thing I won't do is attempt to compare this derivative waste of time with other films or literature.If you are a Pettyfer fan and love seeing him (who doesn't!) then get this. If you love Neil Patrick Harris, get this. If you're in your teens I imagine you might own this already. Otherwise, I'd say steer clear of this. It is all in all a waste of time and great talent. It makes me truly fear for Pettyfer, who has a dazzling future ahead of him ... which he ought to have begun already!",3,There is no real reason to 'embrace THIS suck' .... -,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,2333,"['BEASTLY', 'CBS', 'Films', '2011', '87', 'minutes', 'was', 'weird', 'beginning', 'obnoxious', 'film', 'was', 'someone', 'had', 'finally', 'opened', 'doors', 'Wallywood', 'teeny-boppers', 'results', 'would', 'expect', 'tenor', 'direction', 'film', 'changed', 'better', 'least', 'kept', 'watching.Galactically', 'gorgeous', 'Kyle', 'Kingston', 'galactically', 'gorgeous', 'Alex', 'Pettyfer', 'third', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'somewhat', 'enjoyed', 'arrogant', 'selfish', 'insanely', 'hurtful', 'little', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'school', 'reminding', 'everyone', 'how', 'beautiful', 'how', 'beautiful', 'people', 'are', 'only', 'winners', 'who', 'count', 'Puke', 'anytime', 'like', 'pretense', 'lack', 'subtlety.After', 'crossing', 'Kendra', 'marvelous', 'Mary-Kate', 'Olsen', 'mysterious', 'Goth', 'witch', 'who', 'also', 'school', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'needle-head', 'monster', 'recognize', 'old', 'stupid', 'horror', 'flick', 'Even', 'attempt', 'fright', 'makeup', 'Alex', 'gorgeous', 'what', 'use', 'one', 'year', 'someone', 'fall', 'love', 'curse', 'be', 'lifted', 'rest', 'can', 'basically', 'imagine', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'film', ""'true"", 'love', 'interest', 'form', 'hippie-tree-hugger-Ugly-Betty-wannabe', 'Lindy', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'Disney', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'blind', 'tutor', 'named', 'Will', 'always', 'lovely', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Jamaican', 'housekeeper', 'Usagay', 'Hamilton', 'round', 'out', 'unnecessary', 'cast.While', 'loved', 'how', 'actors', 'carried', 'awful', 'film', 'beautiful', 'message', 'wonderful', 'location', 'Qu', 'eacute', 'added', 'general', 'stillness', 'movie', 'was', 'irritated', 'words', 'endless', 'stream', 'whiny', 'music', 'such', 'films', 'nothing', 'more', 'music', 'videos', 'Also', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'was', 'good', 'writer', 'direction', 'was', 'so-so', 'One', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'attempt', 'compare', 'derivative', 'waste', 'time', 'other', 'films', 'literature.If', 'are', 'Pettyfer', 'fan', 'love', 'seeing', 'who', ""n't"", 'then', 'get', 'love', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'get', ""'re"", 'teens', 'imagine', 'might', 'own', 'already', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'say', 'steer', 'clear', 'waste', 'time', 'great', 'talent', 'truly', 'fear', 'Pettyfer', 'who', 'dazzling', 'future', 'ahead', 'ought', 'have', 'begun', 'already']",Beastly

Which means, since he's the star of a teen Hollywood movie, he's about to lose it all and learn some Life Lessons in the process.  When his arrogance attracts the attention of a witchy-looking girl (Mary-Kate Olsen, he finds himself becoming well - beastly.  Well, sort of.  The Kyle in the eponymous book fares much worse - literally turning into a beast.  With fur that grows back within minutes. Movie Kyle just loses his hair and acquires some freaky tattoos.  Horrified at the change in his son, Kyle's mean, shallow dad (Peter Krause) sequesters him in a fancy apartment and hires Neil Patrick Harris as a live-in tutor.  He has only a year in which to find a girl who truly loves him for who he is - which means becoming less self-centered - otherwise the curse is permanent.Pettyfer, who is also a model, looks the part of a spoiled brat, but he seems half-hearted about acting nasty.  He's much better during the rest of the movie which requires him to look wounded, angry and vulnerable.  I actually found the tattoos kind of sexy.  Since his character still resembles an actual human being, the whole necessity of having him stay away from other people and not be permitted to attend school was missing.  Especially, in the city - who would really give him more than a second glance?  There was absolutely no danger or drama that he might be recognized skulking around with a hoodie.Fans of the book should know that quite a bit is changed - including character names.  The ending is changed, too - we never find out what happens when Kyle's dad sees his transformed son.

1300652,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002ZG975Q,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","There have been other stage plays, musicals and films that recall the old fairytale of Beauty and the Beast and the message they all hold - that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder - is a solid one. BEASTLY, adapted from  a 2007 novel by Alex Flinn, is 'a retelling of the fairytale Beauty and the Beast set in modern-day New York City from the view of the beast. Flinn researched many versions of the Beauty and the Beast story to write her book. Many of these are playfully alluded to in portions of the book, particularly the chat room transcripts in which the character of Kyle talks to other teens who have been transformed into creatures.' Not having read the book may be an advantage or disadvantage depending of how well Miss Flinn placed words in the mouths of her characters.  But writer/director Daniel Barnz adapted the story and the screenplay is an embarrassment.Kyle (Alex Pettyfer from 'I am Number Four') is a cocky, conceited handsome rich son of a popular television personality who runs for high school office on the platform that looks and social standing and popularity and money are the only important values on which to elect a person to a position: he is a cad who steps on anyone to climb the ladder of accelerated ego. He snubs his opponent Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) and marches to victory.  At a party Kyle encounters Kendra (Mary-Kate Olson) a ridiculous appearing strange girl who is a witch and puts a curse on Kyle: he will become ugly for a year and only be able to regain his handsome raison d'etre for living if he can find a girl to say she loves him before his year is up. Kyle faces his equally obnoxious superficial father (Peter Krause) who, in horror,  finds an apartment for his now grotesquely ugly son and leaves his housekeeper Lola (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and home tutor, blind Will (Neil Patrick Harris), to care for him.  Kyle attempts to hide himself from the world but with Lola's and Will's advice he returns to the streets at night where he observes a now beautiful Lindy attempting to protect her drug addict father (Roc La Fortune). He follows her, watching her from afar until they finally meet and Kyle allows Lindy to see his ugly beast face expecting Lindy to be repulsed (she is not) and thus begins Kyle's wooing of Lindy to extremes that lead to what we all knew would be the ending of the story.Alex Pettyfer is a British actor who shows promise and has the looks to make him a teen idol (even with his silly 'beast' paste  on makeup): he deserves better.  Everyone in the cast seems uncomfortable with the oh-so-pop dialogue and the aspects of the film that could have left a worthy message are buried in the mess of the production.

Else how could our repulsive lead wend his way across New York City without people getting all gape-y and finger-pointy? Regarding cinematic adaptations of this classic fairy tale, BEASTLY isn't about to supplant Jean Cocteau's masterpiece or the gorgeous Hamilton/Perlman television series or the Oscar Best Picture-nominated Disney animated film. But neither is BEASTLY a steaming pile of poopage, either, as them critics what be purporting. If you rummage in there, you'll unearth several redeeming grace notes, at least enough for me to rate this sucker 2.5 out of 5 stars, a passable mark.First, you have to like Vanessa Hudgens - and, yep, right there I can sense some folks already tuning off. Hudgens sold me in BANDSLAM, a movie that I dig to absurd levels. She brings a waifish quality as Lindy, the Beauty in this bit. And her smile is never less than entrancing. I happen to think that Mary-Kate Olsen is a left-field choice which ends up working, although initially I was doubting as Thomas. And Neil Patrick Harris brightens up each scene he's in as Kyle's blind tutor. Ultimately, the romance of Beauty and her Beast may be my favorite fairy tale of all time, so I'm always up for any iteration of it.If you can transpose Austen and Shakespeare's works to modern-day high school, why the heck not Beauty and the Beast? So be it. BEASTLY, adapted from Alex Flinn's YA novel, opens with seventeen-year-old Kyle Kingson (Alex Pettyfer) delivering a public speech as his classmates admiringly look on. Kyle Kingson surveys his high school realm and basks in the glow of his own grand poobahness. And maybe you can forgive him his smugness, if he also doesn't make a huge point of ragging on those he deems inferior (which is pretty much everyone else). Some distance away, a quite, grounded girl named Lindy observes him. She's not in his social circle. She's not even on his radar.The notorious Kendra (Olsen), however, is very much up Kyle's nose, what with her in direct competition for the school presidency he covets. A rumor bandied about is that Kendra, with her weird gothy looks and odd behavior, is a witch, and maybe Kyle should've taken heed before he humiliated her in public. Kendra casts a spell which physically transforms Kyle Kingson into a freakshow, tattoos and boils and ugly scars and rampant baldiness, his appearance now reflecting the ugliness within. Kendra decrees that unless Kyle finds someone to love him within a year's time, his new look will become permanent. ""Kyle?"" she remarks and throws his words back at him, ""Best embrace the suck."" Oh, snap.The son of a well-off single parent (and a famous news anchor, at that), Kyle steals himself away in a huge isolated apartment, and this will have to pass as the Beast's forbidding castle. Kyle pins his hopes on his father, but his dad is a neglectful tool what can't cope with what's befallen his son. If he's one of them types to pick up a broom, he'd sweep his own son under the rug. Easy to suss out who's been imparting life lessons to Kyle. After five months of neglect and self-imposed exile, Kyle has pretty much given up.But then he runs into Lindy.This being a modern retelling, you can work out what happens next. And maybe that's one of the film's flaws, that it doesn't bother to step out of its predictable tweaking. The dialogue is unsnappy. And, glaringly, how Lindy comes to stay at Kyle's apartment just doesn't go down believably. More, the message of inner beauty over superficiality is kicked to the dirt a bit because, it turns out, Pettyfer rendered with thorn tattoos and bereft of follicle is still a pretty attractive-looking and buff hombre. It's a no-brainer that the filmmakers were angling for the teen girl votes, another reason why Pettyfer went shirtless a bunch of times. Still, one wishes he'd looked really repugnant, to lend more resonance to the love story. Perhaps some fur was needed, and paws with claws. Who would've thought I'd miss Robby Benson? There's enough eye candy provided by the two leads. And if you relish watching this tale as old as time progressing down its traditional trajectory (or close enough to it), then BEASTLY has something to offer you. But this is a pale, watered down version.The DVD's bonus stuff: an Alternate - and, frankly, even more draggy and awkward - Ending (00:10:12 minutes long); 3 non-impactful Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:04:48 minutes); ""A Classic Tale Retold: The Story of BEASTLY"" - basically the Making Of the film featurette as the cast and author Alex Flinn share their thoughts about the film (00:10:06); ""Creating the Perfect Beast"" - what went into creating the look of the Beast (00:05:07); and the ""Be Mine"" music video by Kristina and the Dolls.",3,"""Kyle?

It's analogous to the way ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is loosley based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"".  In fact, both adaptations use a high school setting.Like ""10 Things"", Beastly's deviation from the original is done well.  The story appeals to teenagers and tweeners, but probably is not suitablke for young Disney kids.  The movie also appeals to my wife due to its combination of romantic love story, fantasy, and simplistic high school character motivations.  but then, my wife likes every version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" ever produced (yes, even the old black-and-white French film).  ""Beastly"" was my wife's birthday gift from our 16-year-old daughter, and they watched it together more than once during the first month.I'm a middle-aged guy who likes typical guy movies.  This isn't one of them - not even close.  I enjoy the occasional high school flick also, but this movie uses high school kids more than it takes place in a high school.  I thoroughly enjoy epic fantasy movies, but ""Beastly"" is light fantasy at best.

Beastly is a story about some stuck up private school snot who becomes a Beast after insulting a witch. He needs to find someone who can truly love him. It's a good premise but it has been done before most notably in the amazing Disney classic movie Beauty and the Beast. It was an unnecessary remake. The acting of Vanessa Hudgens and Alex Pettyfar is very amateur.,2,Okay Movie,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,454,"['Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'was', 'far', 'Beastly', 'story', 'stuck', 'up', 'private', 'school', 'snot', 'who', 'Beast', 'insulting', 'witch', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'truly', 'love', 'good', 'premise', 'been', 'done', 'most', 'notably', 'amazing', 'Disney', 'classic', 'movie', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'remake', 'acting', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Alex', 'Pettyfar', 'very', 'amateur']",Beastly
1300662,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B002ZG975Q,judy,"[0, 0]","Beastly. Wow, I never that would be a movie title. Wow. But the title my dear readers, is not the problem with this film. Nope, we have actually worse things to tell about this film than its title. Well this film has issues, but anyways let's just get to the bad things with this film; they include the cast, acting, script, plot, and ending. This movie fails to cast a group of actors that actually want to be in this. I mean you go and look at Mary Kate - Olson and she looks like she would just love to get shot in the head rather than put on  the costume's and wigs and be all witchy. I swear I can think of at least 10 other actress's that would have been way better and more excited in the rule then her.  Alex Pettyfier is not a bad actor. It's just that while he's good in the role, he and Vanessa Morgan share no chemistry. Its way unrealistic. Zac Efron, however CAN share chemistry with Vanessa and make it believable. Alex, even though he's probably the best cast out of the lot, could have been replaced. It might have saved Vanessa, from suffering with poor acting.  The script is very mediocre, and cheesy. I find all the lines un-inspired and repeated threw out the film. It's like the writers couldn't find anything for the actors to do except call Alex ""ugly"", and for him to say ""she will never love me"", and ""I'm so hot, and I'm so ugly"" it's like shut up we get it.  None of it really works. It's all bland, bland, and bland.  And product advertisement, product advertisement. That goes with the plot to. It's so UN - original.  Okay, so I get it your trying to rip- off of ""Beauty and the Beast"" okay- okay. Now what's new here? Where does this story go? I mean I feel like I'm watching a darker version of Disney's Beauty and the Beast. So what do we have, that's new. Okay so we have a guy, a handsome guy, who knows he's handsome. Who  pisses off a witch girl, and gets turned into a monster. And so he needs a girl to turn him back by falling in love with him, and bla bla bla. What's original about that? That's Beauty and the Beast, but with a less attractive title. The ending was so ugg. It was unsurprising let's say that. Alex ends up saying a very cheesy line from the cheesy script, the two falls for each other they hug, kiss. The end. Oh and the dad ends up getting the same  thing his son got. Wow, I was so surprised by that very quick ending. Poor. Now onto the good things with this film which include, the make - up, opening, Alex Pettyfier, jokes, music. Okay so probably the highlight of the film is indeed the make - up. It is very well detailed, and very good eye candy. When I look at Alex's face after he turned into a ugly beastly character, he looked so neat. And while he looked d like a freak, he looked very well detailed. And realistic in the make - up.  I loved it, I just love the different tattoos and silver scars on his face, and neck, and arms.  It all works very well. The opening which was with Alex Pettyfier announcing how rich and beautiful, was very well acted, and even though the lines were very cheesy in that scene, and so very much absurd, it still was able to start the film out with the main idea on why he was so beastly, and it was just well a good introduction into the dastardly character Alex played.  This leads me into my next topic which is about how Alex suited the role. While I think he should been replaced with Zac, he wasn't a poor choice for the role. He was very convincing as the self - centered jerky character that is Beastly. And very convincing I really liked him. The jokes in this film are very good. While the jokes were definitely not supposed to be in this film and were done by accident (apparently) this film did hold me over for those few jokes that snuck their way onto the scripts. And I loved em!  I loved the opening music, which was catchy and got people's attention, Well All and All, this film is not a successful romantic film, and fails to become the classic ""Beauty and the Beast' was, but with the help of a few detailed works, and a very attention grabbing trio, we don't have a miss either.

1300664,A3BU01QBK9HOKD,B002ZG975Q,"Just ""Anna""","[6, 7]","I rarely watch movies (and have been TV-free for 15 years), but I took exception and saw this, hoping for a modern spin on a beautiful fairie-tale.  I was keenly disappointed in Hollywood's efforts to translate ancient story to present-day production.First, it is completely unbelievable that a person so verbally horrible to others would be allowed to make the speech he did, without being called on it by school authority of some sort.  Second, it's hard to believe that a son so put off by his own father's behavior would so embrace it - typically the opposite is true, even in cases where desperate desire for paternal love is the case.Then there's Vanessa H., who has yet to impress me.  She can't sing any better than the other girls out there of her age, is average fare where acting is concerned and the only thing I see that she has going for her is that she's ""eye candy"", to use one of Kyle's phrases.  So does that mean our 'beast' will only fall in love with a sexy lil' thang?  Hardly inspiring, that.  Her character is a 'green freak', but she's chomping on boxed/processed candies, drinking Starbucks-esque lattes and decked out in synthetics while pumping pop/rock into her ears.  Something doesn't quite jive with what they're telling us.  There's actually nothing that sets this heroine apart from her peers - she's social network addicted, constantly on the cellphone, and gives little girly noises when she speaks.  She's drawn to Kyle because 'even though he's wrong, he's real about who he is'.  So beauty, apparently, equates to 'real'.  Good to know - Timothy McVey suddenly is so very beautiful.  Like, no way, and... well, no way.The tragic hero truly is self-absorbed thru the entire movie, even at the end, when he's supposed to be so changed: he won't return her calls, because *HE* is upset with how things are playing out.  When he's not self-obsessed, he's played as desperate to a painful point - where he has no pride at all.  The extremes don't create a balanced character at all.Neil Patrick Harris - very funny, completely over the top, though.  He's just unbelievable.  And that's leaving out the 'blind-guy-kicks-arse-at-darts' thing.  Of course tutors would just sit around, twiddling thumbs for months on end, providing snarky dialogue to try to redeem the movie.  Or is he a friend of Kendra's, just waiting for his own curse to be lifted by doing penance babysitting Kyle?  It would've at least added something deeper to the very flat and Disney-imitated plot.REALLY high on the list of things not to miss are the drug dealers.  Her dad gets in an argument, baddie #1 pulls a gun, Kyle kicks it away, baddie #2 kicks Lindy down a flight of stairs, then both baddies (and Dad) stand staring at each other while Kyle carries her back to her apartment building, returning just in time for Dad to shoot baddie #1.  Dad turns on Kyle, who knocks it away again (!?) and then baddie #2 in his rage and anguish *DOESN'T* do... anything.  Do you think if you were a thug and someone kills your brother and was unarmed, YOU'D just turn tail?  Hardly.Our witch?  You couldn't slather her with a more dramatic air.  Her curse on Kyle... is ""Embrace the Suck"".  Oh, yeah, that'll do it.  Be sure to add a close-up of her retina to make it seem magical, or it'll fall flat.  Wait, it did, anyhow.  They couldn't decide on a look for her, either, so she goes from vamp to dreds to Pulp Fiction to Fairy Witch-mother... it wasn't coherent or well done.I've read that the book is better in the comments, here.

Alex Flinn nailed it when adapting this tale into a modern day retelling. As with all movie adaptations I was a little worried that the movie would spoil the sweet story I had envisioned as I read the book. My initial concerns were only face value:1.) Vanessa Hudgens did not physically fit the character of Lindy.2.) Kyle wasn't a &#34;Beast&#34; he was more of a victim of an angry tattoo artist3.) The standard plea...&#34;Oh please stay true to the book&#34;I am very happy to report that I (and Kelli) truly enjoyed this movie! I loved all the changes that were made for the big screen. Alex Pettyfer is on FIRE! And he did great portraying Kyle/Grant/Adrian. I actually think that Kyle was more disturbing in the movie and a true modern day beast. I really liked the tree tattoo that kept track of the passing year & Mary Kate Olsen really pulled off Kendra the Witch. And how funny was Neil Patrick Harris?! I loved him as Will.

On the one hand, it is so fantastical that you can go with it; on the other, it's just a little too creepy.

The closest I can come is that the main actors seemed higher caliber than their roles here; and that there were some funny moments, few and far between. But, alone in this wilderness of refuse, they seem hardly more than a few points on the horizon.I have never read the book (nor do I plan to), so I don't know if it's as much of a stinker as this film; the mere fact that it must bear some commonalities, however, to the film is enough to dissuade me from the effort -- there are too many worthy books to waste the time on this.1/5 stars.

While I'm glad to say I still love her, I can't say I loved a single second of the painfully boring pile!!!Basically we have a story that's an update of Beauty of the Beast, except just cheapened. At least Beauty and The Beast was a fun movie with awesome songs. Beastly? Just another dreadfully boring teen romance flick. Even my girlfriend was bored, and I can't blame her.The main protagonist is a total sue. Kyle is an unlikable dick and I absolutely did not care for him even once throughout the entire movie. I didn't even care for Hudgens' character either. The ONLY character I liked was Neil Patrick Harris' character as the blind tutor, at least he managed to have a few funny scenes and lines. NPH was clearly in it for the paycheck, as several of his deliveries of lines and facial expressions suggested, but at least he kept my attention.

1300694,A2QU05H6Y0DPNC,B002ZG975Q,Romantic Glutton,"[100, 106]","Having read the book and seen the movie within a week, I'm here to say that the movie could have been so much better.As is often the case, the book is always better than the movie. Often, for reasons unknown, the screenwriters/ directors/ producers decided what is worth keeping from the novel and what isn't. And often it is us the readers who are left disappointed with their vision.So what left me disgruntled was this:Why make Kyle refuse to learn in the movie? Part of the beauty of the novel was that Kyle found solace in the beauty of books and learning. I loved that he was able to relate his situation to the dark characters he connected to in classic novels. The book emphasized that Kyle went through a process where he began to care about himself as a person and cultivate his mind. Also, this process truly shows the relationship between him and his tutor and it's a very special one. In the movie- Kyle refused to learn and scoffed at books and tutoring. Not only is it a terrible message to the youth marketed for this film- but it also ruins a substantial part of the depth of this character. In the novel, one really feels that Kyle is becoming a better person by committing himself to education and relating his experience to classic literature. AND because of this new-found love- he is able to relate to Lindy and that is one of the reasons they fall in love. This was IMPORTANT! He reads Jane Eyre for the girl because she asks him too. That was a beautiful metaphor, of course, and it was just totally missed in the film.Why change the character Sloan? In the book, Sloan was the female version of Kyle. There are essential parts of the book where Kyle learns about love and humanity by realizing that Sloan is superficial and was using him for popularity. Even her role at the end was essential to realizing the growth of Kyle. In the movie, they take Sloan and make her into a victim which just doesn't work. At one point Kyle hears Sloan say that she ""had to be mean"" because she felt Kyle made her that way. This makes Sloan into a nice girl who was forced to torture other people because Kyle forced her too. This just didn't work for me in the plot line. If she really was this nice person under her mean (fake) exterior, then perhaps she would have actually loved Kyle or helped him after his transformation. In the book, she only loves him because he's popular and handsome and when he goes to her, she runs away. This was an important series of events! It was part of his learning process about love and the depth of people. The movie pretty much axed her part and changed her role in the story- therefore taking out another essential slice of the pie.Why in the world did they change the end of movie?! When I read the book, I found the last pages to be so powerful and amazing. I re-read the ending several times and then sat back, sated, feeling a surge of romantic pleasure. I was really shocked that they removed the best part of the story- which, in essence, was the part that made you, the viewer/reader, realize that Kyle really had ""changed"" and deserved a second chance at life. What he did for his lady love was so amazing and was such a true sacrifice, I just melted! The movie as it is now just ends sorta ho-hum. An anti-climatic reunion at best.I've read the critic reviews and nearly all of them say this movie isn't good because the transformation of Kyle just isn't believable. The movie seems silly to them because it has no depth. I think the reason why is because all of the parts of the story that showed his growth and depth were removed. I could go on about parts that are missing, but basically the filmmakers just used the shell of the story and didn't include the meat inside. You can't tell a viewer that the beast has evolved simply by telling them it's so. You have to prove it.I felt the movie was sorta awesome but always fell short of total awesomeness. I had watched the preview to the film at least a dozen times and, in my mind, I had filled in the movie with so much possibility. I was so excited to see the actors take the depth of the novel and really push their limits to showcase this fairy tale as a real modern-day possibility. But I felt they were often holding back. There were some moments I cheered because I felt the real poignancy of the depth of the story... but overall I felt like the actor's were told to be deep but not too deep.I don't blame this on Vanessa or Alex. I could almost feel them both wanting to do more. So what happened? Can we do so more filming and add in the parts that were missed to make it a real winner?This really had potential but I suggest you go read theBeastly Movie Tie-in Editionif you haven't had a chance.******EDITED EDITED EDITED FOR AN UPDATE******:For those of you who are interested, the DVD special edition of the film has the correct ending of the movie under the ""deleted scenes"" area of the Special Features as an alternative ending. Perhaps it was too violent to show in theaters, who knows... but it's actually better (in my opinion) than the cheesy ending they tacked onto it.",3,It's a 5 star film in my

Der,"[2, 2]","I wanted to give this movie 1 star, but since Vanessa in it - I guess 2 stars. lolThis is just a modern day retelling of Beauty and the Beast but done very badly. The screenwriters made this movie more of a teen chick flick than what it should had been.In the beginning of Beauty and the Beast there is a witch that goes to the guy/prince for help and when he doesn't help her, the witch puts a curse on him. In this movie, it's more the witch just shows up and is just there. The guy makes fun of her and so she gets back at him with a curse. This was close to the story main point, but doesn't really work if you already know the true Beauty and the Beast story.All the teen flick ideas comes in by the guy actually caring about what other High School teen think about the guy. The guy best friend and his girlfriend cheats on the guy. Who cares? Then, a few other stuff that wasn't needed for this movie, but to make it into more of a teen flick.I really didn't like the guy in this movie. This movie him get a beautiful girl too easy just because he has money. You can be really ugly and just have money to get a beautiful girl that what I saw. Also, most people would call him a stalker because he follows her around nightly. He goes though her web page account and learns things about her. She gets knock out and immediately takes her away. Then, he demands her to leave with him. He says it's for her protection, but we all know that he really a super stalker!Vanessa looks hot as she usually does, but since this isn't high school musical, she doesn't have much acting skills. Also, since she not signing songs, she has to make up the difference in talent, but she doesn't have the skills too. So, she was just okay to be in this bad movie.I don't recommend this movie.

And these are the perfect qualities in his eyes for being class president.  Kyle gets a wake-up call though when he teases a witch-like girl in his class and she puts a spell on him, turning him into a scarred, tattooed freak.He has one year to get a girl to genuinely tell him she loves him or he will be cursed with bad looks forever.Kyle goes into hiding and while trying to win over the girl that his heart really yearns for, he also learns a thing or two about inner beauty.Yeah, it's a take on the old Beauty and the Beast story, but it works.  I really enjoyed this one.  Alex Pettyfer plays Kyle.  You might recognize him as the lead from I Am Number Four.  He's good eye candy.  Even when he was the tatted up bald beast, he's still pretty hot.  Mary-Kate Olsen plays Kendra, the witch, and even she was pretty decent and looked great. Vanessa Hudgens plays Lindy, the girl that Kyle falls for.  She wasn't bad either.I really appreciated her character's back story more than anything.  Her father is a druggie and kills a dealer to save her.  She goes into hiding at Kyle's house for protection and this is how she gets to know him, though she doesn't know its really Kyle from her school, a guy that she didn't really know very well outside is pompous showman attitude.The real surprise is Neal Patrick Harris, who plays Kyle's blind tutor.  He offers up quite a bit of humor and since he can't judge Kyle by his looks, he teaches Kyle that he shouldn't judge himself in that manner either.Kyle's father is a popular news anchor and just as stuck up as his son.  When Kyle becomes cursed, he tucks Kyle away in a penthouse in the city.  It becomes obvious that his father is ashamed of him since he keeps canceling plans with him.  The father quickly falls out of the storyline all together as Kyle concentrates instead on breaking the curse by getting Lindy to love him.  This father/son storyline was probably the weakest part of the movie, and I didn't really are that it didn't get wrapped up in the end.A touch of love.  A touch of whimsey.  Heart. Emotion.

I also liked the father-son-relationship and how it went to the roots of Kyle's character, i.e. how his father forced his own attitude upon him, encouraged him about everything, but never did really love his son. Kyle's looks were convincing too, far better than the ""beastly"" alternative which, as I heard, was described in the book.The downside is that the movie is by far too short and the significant scenes both too superficial and too few. Though the chemistry between the two protagonists works quite well, it is not clearly understandable why, when and how Kyle actually changes, and how these two fall in love. Not only is the ending predictable, it is not really moving because the whole story just skims the surface of the feelings it is about.A pity - I believe this movie could have been a lot better.

It's ultra-romance, where the bad guy realizes the error of his ways, and the poor-girl hot-chick still manages to look pretty and stay smart despite her severe family troubles - but the film knows what it is and doesn't shy away from it. The screenwriter tried to be ""hip"" with the dialogue, creating his own lingo that resembles a sore thumb at times when the actors (young and hip in their own right) stumble on, rather than integrate, the new lexicon.A highlight is Neil Patrick Harris as the blind tutor, whose frequent one-liners give the film a levity it greatly needs in order to stay away from the ""I love you so much it hurts"" scenario that a film like this always gravitates toward. Also a huge welcome back to Mary-Kate Olsen as the witch. Her outfits are a character all their own.The plot is simple and stays true to the book. It would be sacrilege to turn Alex Pettyfer into a real beast, so I forgive the producers of the film for playing tame on that account. This is the type of movie teenagers see and swoon over, which brings back plenty memories of a certain Mr. DiCaprio reciting Shakespeare. I love the film for that, so if you don't mind a little sap - and Vanessa Hudgens - give it a shot.",3,One for the Saps,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,1293,"['One', 'saps', 'Maybe', 'recent', 'break-up', 'talking', 'liked', 'one', 'ultra-romance', 'where', 'bad', 'guy', 'error', 'ways', 'poor-girl', 'hot-chick', 'still', 'look', 'pretty', 'stay', 'smart', 'severe', 'family', 'troubles', 'film', 'what', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'screenwriter', 'tried', 'be', 'hip', 'dialogue', 'creating', 'own', 'lingo', 'sore', 'thumb', 'times', 'when', 'actors', 'young', 'hip', 'own', 'right', 'stumble', 'rather', 'integrate', 'new', 'lexicon.A', 'highlight', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'blind', 'tutor', 'frequent', 'one-liners', 'give', 'film', 'levity', 'greatly', 'order', 'stay', 'away', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'scenario', 'film', 'always', 'Also', 'huge', 'welcome', 'back', 'Mary-Kate', 'Olsen', 'witch', 'outfits', 'are', 'character', 'own.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'true', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'sacrilege', 'turn', 'Alex', 'Pettyfer', 'real', 'beast', 'forgive', 'producers', 'film', 'playing', 'tame', 'account', 'type', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'see', 'swoon', 'back', 'plenty', 'memories', 'certain', 'Mr.', 'DiCaprio', 'reciting', 'Shakespeare', 'love', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'sap', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'give', 'shot']",Beastly

But after watching all of the supplements, I saw that there was some sincerity put into the making of this, so I put aside the bad acting (the worst I have seen for several of these competent actors) and questionable writing to just try and get some light entertainment.The story follows our great looking character as he is smitten with himself but is disfigured to learn the lessons of finding himself and real love. You get your spattering of high school antics being played by post-college grads and adults, culminated with a totally unbelievable love story in a forced situation. The picture quality is not benchmark but does show some strength in the daytime sequences. The DTS also has some nice moments (nightclub scene, some echoes) but most of the surround time is from that soundtrack (love or hate it). The supplements are a mixed bag though:* Alternate ending, 10:13 minutes. I initially saw this and thought how much better it would have been to keep this grittier and completely different ending in the film - but then the cheesy writer came through in full force to make it have to be cut. Answers the question of where those scenes went we saw in the trailer.* Deleted scenes, 5 minutes. They are actually like alternate takes, with the hilarious exception of the zoo sequence as it was a verbatim piggyback-from-Twilight copy...barf.* Classic Tale Retold, 10:06 minutes. A very clip-heavy interview piece about how they brought this story to screen and character analysis by the actors (almost worth the watch for the unintended humor). The clips total more than half of this.* Creating the Beast, 5:01 minutes. A background on the concepts and make-up for Pettyfer's face.* Music Video, Kristina and the Dolls, 3:00 minutes. I can tolerate the shaky cam thing fairly well, but when did this earthquake cam thing start (brutally fast vibrational cam)? Irritating.5.1 DTS English only and subs in same. I was surprised as usually Sony includes a great deal more for languages and subs.

True, I did not read the novel but every movie made based on a novel always comes out short because they cannot fit everything in a 2 hour movie (and this one is only about an hour and half). Geez, I read the complaints in the other reviews saying, ""why is there a witch"" or ""it's so unbelievable"". Well, duh! How will there be a curse if there isn't a witch to put the curse? Yeah, and are werewolves and vampires more believable? It's a good movie with a good moral (inside beauty is more important than outer beauty). No sex, no cussing -- which isn't necessary in this movie anyway. Alex Pettyfer is such an eye candy, so that's a plus.

1300708,ADGLADSOHAQMJ,B002ZG975Q,The Book Runner,"[8, 10]","Review written by 14 year old girl:The film ""Beastly"" did not impress me at all. There were a few funny lines but the movie lacked a certain realness that it desperately needed. The background music for each scene was very annoying and didn't really fit the moment. The scriptwriter needs a ton of help and an editor. This wasn't exactly a child's movie because of the flippant use of several cuss words, a somewhat scary make-up job, and a magic wielding witch.It is the story of Beauty and the Beast twisted to meet modern standards. Kyle is a spoiled rich kid who doesn't really have his dad's attention and Lindy is a drug addict daughter who just wants a little happiness. Kyle wins his high school presidential election but openly derides the school's ugly witch and is cursed to become as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside; until he finds someone to love him. His dad moves him to a new house where Kyle lives alone with a maid and a blind teacher. When Lindy's dad kills a drug dealer's brother and she is threatened, Kyle tells her dad the only way she can be protected is if she comes and lives with Kyle. Now all Kyle has to do is make her love him.The romance in this movie was extremely awkward and not at all realistic. I don't particularly like Vanessa Hudgens as an actress and her droning voice and lack of posture gets on my nerves. She is very pretty but she moans in the back of her throat, doesn't stand straight, can't really act, and depletes her femininity by frequent swearing. It was so awful to watch her act out the part of a desperate sappy romantic. The scene on the park bench was really pathetic and the ending also needed a whole lot of help. I would have had him transform in front of her and the entire school instead of walking out, giving her a pitifully told story a cheesy line about love, then kissing her in the middle of the street.I didn't really feel like the creators put a full effort into trying to get the movie's message across. The message of the importance of family was never completed because her dad over-dosed on drugs and was sent to a hospital and you never hear of him again and his dad gets a visit from the school's witch (played by one of the Olson twins) and it never explains whether he has a better relationship with his son after that or not. Kyle's blind teacher was the best actor in the movie and that was because of how hilariously funny he was and how silly he looked when he was cross-eyed. He is why I even gave two stars to this movie. My absolute favorite part was when the movie ended because as we left the theater each spectator was handed small boxes of Juicy Fruits.I did not find this movie worth making. The people were miscast, the lines that weren't funny were terrible, and the modernization of the story eliminated the audience it was made to entertain. The existence of this terrible movie is completely pointless.Would I/Did I buy it? NoWould I watch it again? NoWould I recommend it to friends?

He openly proclaims people should vote for him because he is good looking and his dad is a celebrity. He has a Barbie Doll girl friend and lives at home with his dad who ignores him.

Kendra, the school witch, who can't rig an election (must not be a Chicago witch) portrayed excellently by Mary-Kate Olsen, places a curse on Kyle.

He has one year to find someone who will tell him, ""I Love You"" or else he will stay ugly forever.

1300713,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG975Q,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","""Beastly"" is a filmic version of an Alex Flinn novel of the same title, a modern retelling of the famous story of ""Beauty and the Beast."" Anyway, that's what they say. Not having read the original book, I cannot be sure, but it looks as if so much stuff is missing in the film adaptation, which feels often rushed.Now, ""the Beast"" is Kyle (Alex Pettyfer, ""I Am Number Four""), handsome, popular but arrogant high school student, and son of a news anchor; ""Beauty"" is Linda (Vanessa Hudgens, ""High School Musical""), a quiet student of the same school who has to live with him (for a very contrived reason) in an expensive New York house with him.The film's story is told from the viewpoint of Kyle, who is turned into the ""Beast"" by Kendra, an eccentric student, or ""enchantress,"" effectively played by Mary-Kate Olsen. Dakota Johnson appears as Sloane, Kyle's girlfriend before he becomes ""beastly,"" but her role is almost non-existent, even pointless.The screen time of ""Beastly"" (that runs only 86 minutes) is too short for what it wants to be. It is too short for Kyle and Linda's romance to be believable, which needs more space to develop. The film is also humorless. Humor comes in the form of Neil Patrick Harris's tutor Will. Talented as he is, his character does not have much to do in the underwritten storyline.Watching ""Beastly"" is like eternally waiting for something interesting to happen. It does when Mary-Kate Olsen and Neil Patrick Harris show up on the screen.

The story gets off to a shallow start, with pretty much every character acting out some stereotype. Kyle places himself squarely in a cult of personality (his), at the expense of everything that matters. Lindy (charmingly played by Vanessa Hudgens) is the earnest one, working her way up from an unfortunate start - almost a Horatio Alger character, or a character from one of those nineteenth century class-consciousness novels. One of the Olsen sisters showed up in goth drag, playing the part of the witch.After that, the classic Beauty/Beast story plays itself out predictably: fair maiden held in isolation with The Beast, he trying desperately to break the enchantment. How this happens in modern-day New York (or something similar) stretches credulity, but I'll go along with that much for the sake of the story. The only real additions to the old fairy tale are Kyle's father - as obnoxious as Kyle, but more practiced - and his tutor, who probably shouldn't make me think of Pinocchio's Jiminy Cricket but does.In the utterly predictable happy ending, true love blossoms.
