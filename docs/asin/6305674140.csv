But I just gotta say...how does a housekeeper who ends up sleeping with both the father and the son in the household end up being the hero of the movie?? She gets pregnant by...well geez, I guess she doesn't know, since she slept with both guys. So now the baby grows up not knowing if the Moriarty's character is his/her father or grandfather...and whether Keifer's character is his/her brother or father...what a freakin' mess! Some fairy-tale ending that is!!!And what's with the original housekeeper being kept on? I don't get that. ""She'll be over to help with the heavy lifting."" Why can't SHE be the live-in housekeeper, and do all the work herself like any normal housekeeper? Did I miss something there? The family loves her and has used her for years, anyway. If she were industrious enough to do all the housework herself, they wouldn't have needed to hire hot-looking Hunter's character in the first place and would have thereby avoided all this mess and the illegitimate birth of ""their"" baby...sheesh.

Kiefer never fails to give a good performance but I do believe that he was a little out of his league with this one.

I must say that I was a little disappointed with the way the film ended and I thought that they could have gone in a different direction but I guess they ended it as they saw fit but I think it could have been so much more.

Michael Moriarty is so believable portraying a tidy, gentile, soft-spoken professor with tender feelings. It was lovely to watch his appreciation develop for this new lady in his house.

We watched this movie twice in one week and plan on viewing it again. The emotions of the three characters are so real.
