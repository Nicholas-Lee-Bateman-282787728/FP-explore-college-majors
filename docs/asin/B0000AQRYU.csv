765667,A1QI4ATF368A9B,B0000AQRYU,Allison,"[0, 0]","This a great, positive, uplifting film. Linda Hamilton plays a WWII German woman who has lost one son and possibly a husband to the horrors of war. When both American and German soldiers stumble upon the cabin  where she is residing with her young son, she wants them to put down their weapons and make peace and celebrate Christmas Eve together. She has tired of war and wants peace in her home.There are great messages in this movie. Both the Germans and the Americans are presented as full-blooded human beings, not as one-dimensional monsters. Both sides are granted humanity. We also see how war has ravaged the lives of both the Germans and the Americans.This movie is also family-friendly. There's only one mild profanity and a little bit of violence (we see two dead bodies and a badly wounded soldier, but it's not that graphic). You don't need f-bombs or gory violence to tell a powerful story.If you like this film, I would also recommend A Midnight Clear and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, two WWII films that deal with similar themes.",5,Excellent holiday film,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,1048,"['great', 'positive', 'uplifting', 'film', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'WWII', 'German', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'one', 'son', 'possibly', 'husband', 'horrors', 'war', 'When', 'American', 'German', 'soldiers', 'stumble', 'cabin', 'where', 'residing', 'young', 'son', 'put', 'down', 'weapons', 'make', 'peace', 'celebrate', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'together', 'tired', 'war', 'peace', 'are', 'great', 'messages', 'movie', 'Germans', 'Americans', 'are', 'presented', 'full-blooded', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'one-dimensional', 'monsters', 'sides', 'are', 'granted', 'humanity', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'war', 'ravaged', 'lives', 'Germans', 'Americans.This', 'movie', 'also', 'family-friendly', 'only', 'one', 'mild', 'profanity', 'little', 'bit', 'violence', 'see', 'two', 'dead', 'bodies', 'badly', 'wounded', 'soldier', 'not', 'graphic', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'f-bombs', 'gory', 'violence', 'tell', 'powerful', 'story.If', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'A', 'Midnight', 'Clear', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'two', 'WWII', 'films', 'deal', 'similar', 'themes']",N/A

Being a fan of most Christmas movies and reading a couple reviews here I figured for the price I couldn't go wrong. Well this is an excellent WWII drama, and the price is remarkable. You typically don't see prices like this on great DVDs very long. The only other movie I bought for such a bargain here was ""Dreamkeeper"" and that is a Hallmark movie. I highly recommend you purchase ""Silent Night"" before it goes out of print and becomes ridiculously priced. Linda Hamilton, Romano Orzani, and the rest the cast are superb in this story based on historical fact. Hamilton plays a mother that has taken her son to a cabin in the woods after their home in the city is bombed. Her strong-minded principles sway American and German soldiers alike into laying down arms while guests in her home.A few Americans and Germans actually had a Christmas Dinner together near the Ardennes in 1944. One of the worst battles of World War II. Check out the episode in ""Band of Brothers"" on that battle or the movies ""When Trumpets Fade"", or ""Battleground"". I have only seen this movie available here at Amazon. You will be lucky to buy it or rent it elsewhere so I suggest you get it here. Based on a true story, it is one of the finest Hallmark movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it. The DVD does not have any extras, but the picture and sound are sharp and you can't beat the price anywhere. Amazon is the only site I have found this movie.

In the midst of terrible fighting between the Americans and Germans during World War II, an isolated cabin in a German forest, and its two inhabitants, becomes the stage for what is a gripping drama on Christmas Eve. From the moment it starts, there is something special about this movie. Linda Hamilton puts in a convincing and riviting performance as a German mother left alone with her son in her isolated cabin as they become embroiled in a confrontation between American and German soldiers, both sides out to destroy each other, in her very house. It's only because of the mother's deep faith in the meaning of peace that the opposing forces are transformed. Although this is a movie set on the eve of Christmas and as such has an understandably religious undertone, its message of the power of peace trancends all faiths whether one is a believer or not and is a cathartic experience. The wonderful black and white filming serves to underscore the isolation of the cabin in the cold German winter and the acting is outstanding from all members of the cast. Linda Hamilton is so transformed in her role that you might not recognize her as the Linda Hamilton of the well-known Terminator movies. Whether you are a beleiver in Christian faith or not, this is a movie for all people to experience. And if you are a believer you'll want to see this movie on Christmas Eve.

Emotions of hate and suspicion are constantly in play as both sides try to forge a truce throughout the evening, while hoping that the love and brotherhood of the Christmas spirit may prevail. This makes for nail-biting suspense followed by periods of genuine, heartwarming camaraderie.Linda Hamilton as Frau Vincken is very believable as the loving but iron-willed woman who enforces the Christmas truce, as well as being a gracious host to all. The rest of the cast, although all unknowns, do a very fine job, including the two juveniles. Production values for this Hallmark production are very good, and the excellent screenplay is gripping to the very end.So if you are looking for something new to view at Christmas time, Silent Night is a wonderful option. It packs more heartfelt Christmas goodwill into its 86 minutes, than a baker's dozen of the predictable schmaltzy films regularly shoveled at viewers this time of year.

All I know is that I like it!It's a pleasure to watch - for all ages. Linda H. is superb in her role, probably the best I've ever seen from her. The supporting cast is nothing short of awesome, appears as though they really immersed themselves in their parts. A fine combination of story, acting, and a bit of hollywood license created a movie that, IMHO, will only become more popular over time.I'm puzzled that Hallmark hasn't been more agressive in marketing this movie. Not every offering from Hallmark is of this quality, after all. Oh well - maybe that will keep the prices down.Even the edited version is great, but cutting the final scene in the region 1 DVD has me scratching my head.

Every single actor in here is really good and there is enough drama and angst to make the characters believable. I strongly recommend, though maybe not for kids under 13 as there are some mild curse words and a bloody wound scene.",5,Great acting makes this movie work.,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,302,"['could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'hokey', 'unbelievable', 'movie', 'not', 'Every', 'single', 'actor', 'here', 'really', 'good', 'enough', 'drama', 'angst', 'make', 'characters', 'believable', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'maybe', 'not', 'kids', '13', 'are', 'mild', 'curse', 'words', 'bloody', 'wound', 'scene']",N/A

This is a perfect example of what can happen if two enemies can just sit together and get to know one another. Perhaps, if all countries did this, perhaps wars would be fewer in existence than they are now. It would be nice if our government leaders can all view this film and learn from it. Oh well, hope springs eternal. At least we can still dream. They haven't taken that away from us yet.Overall, a well done film I recommend to anyone.",5,Excellent character study! Well done!
