428549,A1UKJF6YPSSZ1Q,6304557906,Erik James,"[6, 6]","Elton Chong is great in this story of revenge and honor.  Chong plays a young man taken in by a Kung fu master after his family was killed.  Unable to learn kung fu due to the masters orders he is left to do the cleaning and cooking.  Harrassed by the other students he tries to learn kung fu in secret but is found out and sent away for punishment.  While away his school is attacked by the &quot;Silver Eagle&quot; (Han Ying) and his band of Lackey's.  On return from his punishment he finds his master dead, and all the students dead aswell.  In fear he runs away and tries to keep a low profile while at the same time trying to find the men responsible.  Due to pure chance he encounters a man who is skilled in the Arts of Shaolin Monkey kung fu.  After countless acts of begging the old man finally takes Chong as a student, puting him through rigurous, almost torturious training routines. Finally after some time he feels ready, and him and his teacher journey out to find the Deadly &quot;Silver Eagle.&quot;  Finally the 3 men meat in what becomes a spectacular display of martial arts.  One of the most memorable end fights.  the &quot;Silver Eagle&quot; is top notch as he takes on the two heroes.  Who's kung fu is superior?

The fight scenes were greatly choreographed.  This flick was interesting to watch from start to finished.  I would definatly recommend it, but the copy I purchased was my worse experience.

428551,APIW11UEPKIC2,6304557906,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[0, 0]","Not to be confused with Gordon Liu's Shaolin Drunken Monk, though this movie does have the same villain, Eagle Han Ying.  And don't worry, he is on the top of his game in this, unlike Shaolin Drunken Monk.At the start of the movie Mike Wong (the costar of Ninja Hunter and Ninja vs Shaolin Guards) plays an old kung fu master (a lot like the one he plays in Magnificent Natural Fist and Snake Strikes Back) who almost gets killed by the villain, The Silver Eagle, played by Eagle Han Ying.  Eagle Han has declared that he is the best fighter, and he is going to kill all other good fighters.  Yes, it is seriously that stupid of a movie. But I will admit that there are a few good genuine moments in this movie between the 2 lead actors, even if they are a bit cheesy.  But for the most part it is extremely cheesy, and bad movie fans will no doubt fall in love with it.Elton Chong plays the hero, and like always, he knows no kung fu at the start.  He meets Mike Wong, and, he learns kung fu of course.  Duh.  Now it's time to look for the villain.  Oh yeah, Elton Chong's dad was killed by The Silver Eagle.  Apparently The Silver Eagle will kill anyone who can even slightly raise their fist.The fights are plentiful, and Eagle Han's kicks are just about as good as they have ever looked.  he is the main reason why this movie is worth watching, though there are plenty of other good reasons.  If you have seen Death Duel of Kung Fu and Ninja vs Shaolin Guards, and you are a fan of Eagle Han, then you cannot pass this movie up.  Yeah it's stupid, but Eagle Han can make any movie worth watching when he is given the chance to show his stuff. And if you are like me and happen to be a fan of Mike Wong and Elton Chong, then there's no way you can go wrong with this movie.Most people are probably unaware of this, but there is a bit of a cult following for Elton Chong.  I am one of those people that enjoy his work.  He is a good actor at times, has good fighting skills, decent acrobatics, and really good grounded and flying kicks.  I would have liked to see what Sammo or another director could have done with him.  He seems to be willing to do anything, like in one scene where he jumps down about 6 or 7 feet into a little creek.  It looked like he could have been severely injured by rocks, but Elton Chong must have just been a really crazy guy, and maybe that's why he always plays such crazy characters. It's too bad he was only in really horrible Korean movies, like this one.  But trust me, this is one of his best.2.5/5I got this from a friend in a trade, and I don't know what version it is, but it is partly widescreen and the picture quality is bad but watchable.  The soundtrack is a ton of fun, and the English dubbing is awesome and cheesy as can be.",3,Looking for a good cheesy kung fu movie with awesome legwork?
