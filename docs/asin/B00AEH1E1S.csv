I returned it and they sent me another one.  This one didn't work either.  Same reason, ""NO DISC"" appears on the tv/player.  I tried the discs in 3 different players and had the same results.  I played dvd's that I have bought (movies) and all worked fine.  Not the players!  I would like to have the games on dvd, but if XOS  is producing them I won't be buying them.",1,Worthless,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,507,"['XOS', 'DIGITAL', 'dvd', 'are', 'joke', 'purchased', 'UA', 'v.', 'Georgia', 'SEC', 'Championship', 'dvd', 'produced', 'XOS', 'Disc', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'up', 'returned', 'sent', 'one', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'either', 'Same', 'reason', 'NO', 'DISC', 'tv/player', 'tried', 'discs', '3', 'different', 'players', 'had', 'same', 'results', 'played', 'dvd', 'have', 'bought', 'movies', 'worked', 'fine', 'Not', 'players', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'games', 'dvd', 'XOS', 'producing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying']",2013 Discover BCS National Championship Game
