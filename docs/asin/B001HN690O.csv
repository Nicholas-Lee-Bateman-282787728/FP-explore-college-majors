1200376,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001HN690O,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I really liked the original `Kung Fu Panda'.  It was cute and the animation was really top notch.  Now that my daughter is older and has become obsessed with the television show (yes, obsessed is HER word for the matter) I've come to have a shaky feeling about the idea of having her watch a cartoon whose sole purpose is to depict martial arts being used on everyone.  Sure, it's the age old `good versus evil' which is kind of used in every cartoon, regardless of tone, but there is something about the excitement of watching someone get beat up that should be reserved for teenage boys, right?  I don't know, I mean, the film is cute and has charm and it is funny in many parts, but the overall feel I get is one of discomfort as the character's punch and kick and fight to the death on numerous occasions.Call me a prude or call me a parent, but at times I feel they should go hand in hand.But, as a film I kind of liked this.  It was just as good as the original, which is a tough hurdle to cross for almost every sequel.  The animation is stellar and the character development is just as tightly etched here as it was in the original, which is a nice bonus.  The storyline has similarities to the original (really, it is a formula that is regurgitated countless times and yet it feels freshly done here, which is nice) and I was pleased to see that the original cast returned.  I just hate it when they cast new actors to play previous characters.  In the end, I am iffy on recommending this because of the violence level, but each parent knows their child and so they can make that decision for themselves.  As a film itself, this is a good one.

1200381,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001HN690O,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Kung Fu Panda 2 will NOT disappoint those who were big fans of the first one.  In fact the sequel is more action-oriented (in some cases overwhelmingly so!).  Right from the very beginning we're introduced with a fighting segment involving our favorite panda bear named Po.  His friends from the first one return and find themselves in the same zanny and outrageous situations as before.  Without giving it a second thought, they help Po whenever danger calls.In this adventure, Po has to battle a peacock who's less than friendly.  In fact this peacock is ruler of the land and calls the shots.  Once he and Po meet, the peacock insists they've met before but Po disagees.  As a result, hilarious lines are exchanged between the two and some of the most explosive fighting scenes appear soon after.  The peacock wants him destroyed but of course, that can't happen!  No way!What makes this storyline different from the first one is how it centers around Po's childhood and particularly how he was abandoned by his parents.  Po is aware of his mysterious past and wants to find out more about it.  He sets out in search of clues and realizes the peacock is the one who has the answers but... Po gets a not-so welcoming interaction whenever he gets too nosey and finds himself caught up in the peacocks business.  Another interesting feature is that there's very little training- Po is already fully charged and ready to take down anything with his ""skills"".  You can probably guess why I put ""skills"" in quotation marks- the way Po knocks out the bad guys is based entirely on being in the right place at the right time with all the right objects surrounding him!Overall, fans of animation will be mighty impressed with the creative visuals that constantly remain full steam ahead, and this is honestly how a sequel *should* be done.

1200390,A1M39P7MO277FV,B001HN690O,Chinmay Hota,"[3, 4]","It's been a long time since it was firmly established that Dreamworks and Pixar were the front runners in the animated movie business. Every movie from their boiling pot is a gem, to say the least. In 2008, an unconventional 3D movie burst into theatres with talking animals as per norm, but now we have the Chinese variety. People were skeptical as to how this would turn out, but the makers of the movie, stayed true to the Chinese tradition of movie-making in their depiction of martial arts, and with a cute sprinkling of good old American humor and talented voice acting, this movie was a little more special than the other ones.As with most of the Dreamworks movies, success demanded a sequel and the producers and writers rose to the occasion and boy, did they deliver. Right off the bat, I would say one thing, `Kung Fu Panda 2' is a better movie than the original in every way.It is in no way a watered down sequel with many missing links and vain attempts at establishing a franchise. This, viewers, is what a sequel should be. This movie is bigger, funnier and more likely to tug at your heartstrings than the previous one.Ever since the Shrek sequels, Dreamworks has been accused of dumbing down the quality of the sequels with lots of pop culture references and mindless jokes that are only likely to earn a few chuckles. But no one can make that claim anymore. This movie finds its strengths and all its factors : animation, story and action sequences are the best out of Dreamworks' production house.All of the main cast including the titular Po (Jack Black), the Furious Five and Master Shen are back in this one. Jack Black has really found his footing and a most fitting role for him in the panda. It suits his voice perfectly and fans of the actor may even find both indistinguishable. The Furious Five, this time are a lot warmer to Po, now that he is the Dragon Warrior. Shifu, too, accepts Po to the fullest and tries to teach him how to achieve inner peace.This sequel follows the time-tested norm of sequels to delve into the main character's past or open up new wounds. The goose as it turns out, is not the biological father of the panda (Oh My God!). Pandas had been prophesized as the ones to defeat the peacock Shen, and so Shen went on a killing spree, harnessing his invention of gumpower to destroy all giant Pandas. Po is a survivor. Faced with this dilemma, Po chooses to stop Shen from destroying Kung Fu with his technology, and must make peace with his past. This stroy resonates the traditional Wuxia genre of China, which you might be familiar with from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The action sequences are masterfully directed in true Hong Kong cinema style. The dialogues are hilarious and consistently uplifting and funny. That does not mean this movie shies away from other emotions. One scene in particular is a tear-jerking one. And when you find such a scene in an Animated ""Meant for kids"" movie, you know this movie is special. I hate to take the name here, but, Kung Fu Panda just might be Dreamworks' Toy Story. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie snagged the best animated movie award away from Disney/Pixar.This movie is a must for all ages. If you have a soul, you will not miss this one. Also, watch in 3D. The technology has been used to great effect in this one, so far as to making me say this might be the best 3D movie of the summer.Chinmay HotaAuthor of ""Hits and Misses""",5,A Must for All Ages,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,3436,"['been', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'firmly', 'established', 'Dreamworks', 'Pixar', 'were', 'front', 'runners', 'animated', 'movie', 'business', 'movie', 'boiling', 'pot', 'gem', 'say', 'least', '2008', 'unconventional', '3D', 'movie', 'burst', 'theatres', 'talking', 'animals', 'norm', 'now', 'have', 'Chinese', 'variety', 'People', 'were', 'skeptical', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'makers', 'movie', 'stayed', 'true', 'Chinese', 'tradition', 'movie-making', 'depiction', 'martial', 'arts', 'cute', 'sprinkling', 'good', 'old', 'American', 'humor', 'talented', 'voice', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'special', 'other', 'ones.As', 'most', 'Dreamworks', 'movies', 'success', 'demanded', 'sequel', 'producers', 'writers', 'rose', 'occasion', 'boy', 'did', 'deliver', 'Right', 'bat', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'better', 'movie', 'original', 'way.It', 'way', 'watered', 'down', 'sequel', 'many', 'missing', 'links', 'vain', 'attempts', 'establishing', 'franchise', 'viewers', 'what', 'sequel', 'should', 'be', 'movie', 'bigger', 'funnier', 'more', 'likely', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'previous', 'one.Ever', 'Shrek', 'sequels', 'Dreamworks', 'been', 'accused', 'dumbing', 'down', 'quality', 'sequels', 'lots', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'mindless', 'jokes', 'are', 'only', 'likely', 'earn', 'few', 'chuckles', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'claim', 'anymore', 'movie', 'strengths', 'factors', 'animation', 'story', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', 'Dreamworks', 'production', 'house.All', 'main', 'cast', 'including', 'titular', 'Po', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Furious', 'Five', 'Master', 'Shen', 'are', 'back', 'one', 'Jack', 'Black', 'really', 'found', 'footing', 'most', 'fitting', 'role', 'panda', 'suits', 'voice', 'perfectly', 'fans', 'actor', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'indistinguishable', 'Furious', 'Five', 'time', 'are', 'lot', 'warmer', 'Po', 'now', 'Dragon', 'Warrior', 'Shifu', 'too', 'Po', 'fullest', 'tries', 'teach', 'how', 'achieve', 'inner', 'peace.This', 'sequel', 'time-tested', 'norm', 'sequels', 'delve', 'main', 'character', 'past', 'open', 'up', 'new', 'wounds', 'goose', 'out', 'not', 'biological', 'father', 'panda', 'Oh', 'My', 'God', 'Pandas', 'had', 'been', 'prophesized', 'ones', 'defeat', 'peacock', 'Shen', 'so', 'Shen', 'went', 'killing', 'spree', 'harnessing', 'invention', 'gumpower', 'destroy', 'giant', 'Pandas', 'Po', 'survivor', 'Faced', 'dilemma', 'Po', 'stop', 'Shen', 'destroying', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'technology', 'must', 'make', 'peace', 'past', 'stroy', 'traditional', 'Wuxia', 'genre', 'China', 'might', 'be', 'familiar', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'true', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'cinema', 'style', 'dialogues', 'are', 'hilarious', 'consistently', 'uplifting', 'funny', 'not', 'mean', 'movie', 'away', 'other', 'emotions', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'tear-jerking', 'one', 'when', 'find', 'such', 'scene', 'Animated', 'Meant', 'kids', 'movie', 'know', 'movie', 'special', 'hate', 'take', 'name', 'here', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'Dreamworks', 'Toy', 'Story', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'movie', 'snagged', 'best', 'animated', 'movie', 'award', 'away', 'Disney/Pixar.This', 'movie', 'must', 'ages', 'have', 'soul', 'will', 'not', 'miss', 'one', 'Also', 'watch', '3D', 'technology', 'been', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'one', 'so', 'far', 'making', 'say', 'might', 'be', 'best', '3D', 'movie', 'summer.Chinmay', 'HotaAuthor', 'Hits', 'Misses']",N/A

1200393,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B001HN690O,C. Sawin,"[101, 114]","The original Kung Fu Panda is one of the only Dreamworks Animation films that actually holds its own in comparison to Pixar films. It managed to capture the look and feel of the classics old and new that martial arts film enthusiasts such as myself admire so much while also offering humor that was actually funny, fantastic animation, and just an incredibly entertaining film overall. It turned out to not only be one of the more enjoyable animated films of 2008, but one of the best films of that year period. So, here we are, three years later with Kung Fu Panda 2 resting on the horizon of its release that actually feels just as strong as the original without all of the endless shortcomings most would expect to plague a sequel.When it comes to animated films, one of the most important ingredients is the cast. The voice cast can make or break an animated feature. A talented one can make it even better while a weaker one can result in it hurting the overall enjoyment of the film. Fortunately, the cast for Kung Fu Panda 2 is pretty spot on. The entire main cast (Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Lucy Liu, Dustin Hoffman, James Hong) returns from the first film and while it would be nice to see some of them have meatier roles and/or more lines (Jackie Chan and David Cross for starters), just having them return is fantastic. Casting changes between sequels are never really great. They can be pleasantly surprising, but it never feels the same. So it's great to see the entire ensemble back in full form. My personal favorite from the original cast is James Hong as Mr. Ping. The Asian American actor is perhaps best known as the villain in Big Trouble in Little China and was also Hannibal Chew in Blade Runner, but hearing that actor voice a goose who runs a restaurant and is so attached to his kung fu panda/China saving son is awesome in itself. Mr. Ping is an emotional wreck with Po putting himself in danger so often and Hong just makes his heartfelt performance stand out above the rest.Newcomers such as Dennis Haysbert (Heat, ""24"") and Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Sunshine) were fun additions. Yeoh voices The Soothsayer, who has a few humorous moments with Lord Shen, but realizing that Jean Claude Van Damme voiced Master Croc gave a little more weight to the throwbacks to well-known martial arts films. That influence is definitely there in the Kung Fu Panda films and both of them use that influence as a crutch in the best of ways, but having talent like Van Damme, Jackie Chan, and Michelle Yeoh participate make it all feel a little more genuine. It'd be like bringing in Chuck Norris, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, or Sammo Hung. The cast in this is just as much a drawing factor in this as it is in something like The Expendables. It makes that homage mean so much more.Gary Oldman practically steals every scene that he's in though. He brings that intensity and dark lunacy associated with his roles in Leon and The Fifth Element to the Lord Shen role; those same traits that made fans love his talent in the first place. He fits the role of an evil albino peacock rather well.The animation is really the film's Tour de force. Every movement flows naturally and everything is so crisp and smooth. Fight scenes are so fast yet easy to digest. Animals talking, portraying human emotion, their hair folding in the wind all look natural. But the art direction of the film is something special. It was already fantastic in the first film, but they really bulked it up for the sequel. It's slightly reminiscent of ""Samurai Jack"" yet more awesome; more engrossing. It captures the feel of Chinese martial arts perfectly and the use of traditional animation during Po's flashbacks was an extremely welcome addition; having Guillermo Del Toro as the creative consultant on the film surely helped in their benefit.Kung Fu Panda 2 is beautifully animated, exceptionally cast, laugh out loud funny, and nearly upstages the original at every turn. While certain things in the film like the ""inner peace"" bit are slightly predictable, it doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment of a sequel that capitalizes and improves on its predecessor rather than feeling like a watered down version of it.",5,A spectacular sequel,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,4261,"['original', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'one', 'only', 'Dreamworks', 'Animation', 'films', 'actually', 'own', 'comparison', 'Pixar', 'films', 'managed', 'capture', 'look', 'feel', 'classics', 'old', 'new', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'enthusiasts', 'such', 'admire', 'so', 'much', 'also', 'offering', 'humor', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'fantastic', 'animation', 'just', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'overall', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'animated', 'films', '2008', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'period', 'So', 'here', 'are', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'resting', 'horizon', 'release', 'actually', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'original', 'endless', 'shortcomings', 'most', 'would', 'expect', 'plague', 'sequel.When', 'animated', 'films', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'ingredients', 'cast', 'voice', 'cast', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'animated', 'feature', 'talented', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'even', 'better', 'weaker', 'one', 'can', 'result', 'hurting', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'cast', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'pretty', 'spot', 'entire', 'main', 'cast', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'David', 'Cross', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'James', 'Hong', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'have', 'meatier', 'roles', 'and/or', 'more', 'lines', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'David', 'Cross', 'starters', 'just', 'having', 'return', 'fantastic', 'Casting', 'changes', 'sequels', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'great', 'can', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprising', 'never', 'same', 'great', 'see', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'back', 'full', 'form', 'personal', 'favorite', 'original', 'cast', 'James', 'Hong', 'Mr.', 'Ping', 'Asian', 'American', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'villain', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Little', 'China', 'was', 'also', 'Hannibal', 'Chew', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'hearing', 'actor', 'voice', 'goose', 'who', 'restaurant', 'so', 'attached', 'kung', 'fu', 'panda/China', 'saving', 'son', 'awesome', 'Mr.', 'Ping', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'Po', 'putting', 'danger', 'so', 'often', 'Hong', 'just', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'stand', 'out', 'rest.Newcomers', 'such', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Heat', '24', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Sunshine', 'were', 'fun', 'additions', 'Soothsayer', 'who', 'few', 'humorous', 'moments', 'Lord', 'Shen', 'realizing', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'voiced', 'Master', 'Croc', 'gave', 'little', 'more', 'weight', 'throwbacks', 'well-known', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'influence', 'definitely', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'films', 'use', 'influence', 'crutch', 'best', 'ways', 'having', 'talent', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'participate', 'make', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'genuine', ""'d"", 'be', 'bringing', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'drawing', 'factor', 'something', 'Expendables', 'homage', 'mean', 'so', 'much', 'more.Gary', 'Oldman', 'practically', 'scene', 'though', 'intensity', 'dark', 'lunacy', 'associated', 'roles', 'Leon', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Lord', 'Shen', 'role', 'same', 'traits', 'made', 'fans', 'love', 'talent', 'first', 'place', 'role', 'evil', 'albino', 'peacock', 'rather', 'well.The', 'animation', 'really', 'film', 'Tour', 'de', 'force', 'movement', 'naturally', 'everything', 'so', 'crisp', 'smooth', 'Fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'fast', 'yet', 'easy', 'digest', 'Animals', 'talking', 'portraying', 'human', 'emotion', 'hair', 'folding', 'wind', 'look', 'natural', 'art', 'direction', 'film', 'something', 'special', 'was', 'already', 'fantastic', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'bulked', 'up', 'sequel', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'Samurai', 'Jack', 'yet', 'more', 'awesome', 'more', 'engrossing', 'feel', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'perfectly', 'use', 'traditional', 'animation', 'Po', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'extremely', 'welcome', 'addition', 'having', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'creative', 'consultant', 'film', 'surely', 'helped', 'benefit.Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'exceptionally', 'cast', 'loud', 'funny', 'nearly', 'original', 'turn', 'certain', 'things', 'film', 'inner', 'peace', 'bit', 'are', 'slightly', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'sequel', 'predecessor', 'rather', 'feeling', 'watered', 'version']",N/A

SPOILER ALERT....) was quite the exhilarating experience ... but not the experience the original 2008 film was. Though this film was spectacular CGI (I expected nothing less) and terrific performances, it is lacking in the good subtle nuances of the first film. The one-liner humor, as brilliant as it is, is simply too thin. All right, so enough of the kung fu practice on the poor thing. Here is what is best about this:Po (Jack Black) and the gang (The Furious Five whom we all know so well) go after Lord Shen (a silky smooth Gary Oldman, who's lost none of his vocal talents). Shen wishes to take China by force with something he has invented: the cannon. Faced with a prophecy that a black-and-white warrior will bring him down, Shen makes certain the pandas don't survive ... and that brings us to Po's discoveries about himself.All good and well for a thrilling sequel; the trouble is things are half-baked. There was nothing in the film that confused me, but then I do have decades of Chinese kung fu films and the best comedy in the world to bolster my perception of the hidden stuff, the shining homages. What about the kids? Well, aside from cartoon violence and a scary cannon brigade, nothing is offensive, but I doubt they'll get half the delight out of it that I got.Especially the very deeply embedded anti-communist message among other things.I can only say that the movie is the height of the art form. Oh, it is a sequel in a new franchise, wide open for the inevitable third film.

In spite of one particular voice/actor who I normally can't abide under any circumstance, namely Jack Black.  But here, disguised as a panda named Po, he is acceptable (but he wouldn't have been my first choice).The story begins with a flashback, a prophecy of a peacock named Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman), who seeks to rule China but who, according to a soothsayer, is also doomed to be thwarted by a black and white warrior.  Here things go all Biblical; Lord Shen tries to exterminate the entire panda population (zebras were ignored).  Naturally, Po was overlooked.  Flash-forward, a new adventure.  Of course, Po's as incompetent as ever, a boob of great girth with good intentions.  Along come some metal thieves and the frantic five, plus Po, spring into action.  It is the year of the peacock; all is not well.  What follows is a lot of running around, scrambling; fighting/losing, with little progress made in defeating their newest enemy, a bird.  ""I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.""It's more than a little annoying the way most action films are constructed, evil triumphs until the very last minute.  Sadly, it's a well-worn formula that most filmmakers stick with.  It does little, however to provide any real suspense (other than frustration).The score was fantastic, the artwork dazzling, I just hope part three, due out late in 2015, improves the story a lot.",4,"""I'm Po.

It combines a well-executed story with heart, impressive animation, creative action scenes, strong characters voiced by a great cast, and is topped off with a lush score by Hans Zimmer.  I was happy when I heard there was going to be a sequel.Kung Fu Panda 2 is a decent movie, but, sadly, feels more like an attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessor than an honest effort to craft another fine tale from the elements of the first.  We are quickly shown a backstory, using 2D animation, to get us to the central conflict of the story, which, strangely, seems like an indirect threat to our heros at best and someone else's problem at worst.  Gone from this sequel's storyline is a theme worthy of the original's: ""There is no secret ingredient--it's just you.""  That thoughtful subtext was cleverly arrived at through two story elements: The secret-ingredient soup and the film's MacGuffin--the Dragon Scroll.  In KFP2, we're treated to Po's journey for ""inner peace""--which really just falls in his lap at the end rather than developing naturally from his experiences in the film.  There is a side story about Po's attempt to find out who his biological family is, which helps flesh out his backstory.  However, the development of the other characters is more shallow this time around; the villain especially feels underdeveloped.  Even the humor falls short of the original.  The animation looks very good, but there's nothing to top the creatively choreographed action of the first, such as Tai Lung's exciting jail-break or Po's showdown with him later.In checking KFP2's credits, I see that the screenwriters are the same as for the original, but there's a new director: Jennifer Yuh, who is a relative newcomer to directing.  It's hard to say if the blame falls with her or with the screenwriters who were just unable to capture lightning in a bottle for a second time.  KFP2's ending suggests we're in for a third installment.

1200423,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B001HN690O,jjceo,"[0, 0]",Kung Fu Panda 2 is a continuation of the first movie and Po is part of the Dragon Warrior team. Po's skills are improving but he is still not the master that Tigress is for example.  His master tells him that he has to learn to focus and learn inner peace.  Po's tactic is to charge into the fight instead of developing a strategy and analyzing the enemy.An evil warrior enemy is threatening to take over all of China and when his evil warriors start to steal materials to make a secret weapon the Dragon Warrior team jumps in to stop them.  When Po sees the warriors he starts having flashbacks about his origins and where he came from.  This causes a lack of self-confidence and this is exactly what Po does not need when confronting a powerful enemy.This is a good storyline with Good facing Evil and how Po must be brave and find his inner self to become the warrior he needs to be to defeat his enemy.  Po's transition from a Dragon Warrior to a powerful Kung Fu master is fun and interesting. The graphics in this movie are wonderful and make the movie.

1200426,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B001HN690O,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[0, 0]","***This review may contain spoilers***Most of Dreamworks's animated efforts have complacently settled for being rousing, diverting, and knowingly satirical action-and-violence stories, but not especially memorable (thinking about Shark Tale, for example).  Occasionally, some of their movies leaven all the crazy action and movement with important themes, like the meaning of isolation and innate virtue and love in the Shrek movies.  However, at the pinnacle of Dreamworks's animated features is one that poignantly delves into the character of a seemingly silly, corpulent, and superficial panda who somehow possesses devastating martial arts skills.  Yes, Kung Fu Panda 2 (hereafter KFP2) has all the action, color, adventure, and conflict of its lesser Dreamworks cousins, but it is also profoundly different. Besides being a chop-socky martial arts adventure for the kiddies, KFP2 offers food for thought for more mature viewers, namely, the importance of balance (or yes, master, yin and yang) for a full and healthy life.At the beginning of KFP2, it appears that the panda, Po (voice of Jack Black), has that full and healthy life.  He is now the accomplished dragon warrior and leader of kung fu wizards the Furious Five, and has the respect and admiration of his sensei Master Shifu (voice of Dustin Hoffman), and the loving supervision of his restauranteur father Ping (voice of James Hong).  But in the Furious Five's latest mission to prevent a horde of wolves from looting metal from a local village, Po's confrontation with the Boss Wolf (voice of Danny McBride) triggers a disturbing memory that knocks him off his stride and lets the wolves get away.  As the usually cheerful Po solemnly ponders these memories which seem to show a wolf attack on a village and two parent pandas leaving their baby behind, those memories intertwine with the machinations of the latest garden-variety megalomaniac, Lord Shen (voice of Gary Oldman).  Shen is a colorless peacock who, partly fueled by resentment against parents he sees as stifling, wishes to conquer China and perhaps the world.  Although adept at kung fu, Shen plans to use weapons and artillery to attack, hence the minion wolves' metal raid.  Thus, if we are careful, we see both the main protagonist and antagonist (Po and Shen) as ""unbalanced"" individuals seeking to stabilize themselves.  The genius of KFP2 is its demonstration that, in a way, each needs the other for balance.Nagging at the back of Po's mind is the realization that Ping cannot be his true father.  But as his dreams gradually show, HE was that baby panda abandoned by his parents in the radish box as the wolves attacked.  That box gradually made its way to Ping's shop.  Since Po's parents did not arrive to claim the child, Ping raised Po as his own, with the usual frustrations and complications.  Po is grateful to Ping, but he is out of balance because he can't understand why his parents would leave him.  A calm, unperturbed, ram seer (voice of Michelle Yeoh) eventually shows Po that Shen instigated the attack on his parents' village and that they had to abandon him for his own safety.  But instead of easing his mind, this knowledge awakens feelings of vengeance against Shen and unbalances Po further.Furthermore, the ram seer nominally works for Shen and constantly reminds him that a force of black and white (i.e. panda Po) will be his undoing and that he should refrain from his conquest.  Shen petulantly and arrogantly refuses to listen. Who - Po or Shen - will embrace balance and, by association, inner peace as exemplified by Master Shifu?  The ram seer advises Po not to obsess on the past but to improve on and develop the present and future.  You know, let it go, and go on.  Does Po listen?  You will see when you witness the climactic confrontration between Po and the Furious Five, and Shen's armed armada sailing down the river to the sea.KFP2 is an astoundingly towering tour-de-force.  It takes the standard worn-out martial arts trope, and balances it with respect of ancient Chinese geography, architecture, and philosophy.  It shows ALL its anthropomorphic characters with multifaceted, sometimes opposite, characteristics (serious and playful) striving to keep them working together.  Finally, KFP2 shows us that balanced inner peace is one of humanity's greatest gifts, symbolized by the familiar black and white yin and yang symbol. Po is of course black and white.  Does he eventually symbolize that peaceful yin and yang?  Again, watch the climactic battle, and you will definitely find out.With this consoling philosophy, KFP2 is a considerable, Pixar-level production, and promises to continue to do so with its sequel-hinting final shot, which promises more conflict but also more consolation for Po.",5,"Kung Fu Panda 2 -

This movie, however, is even more rare in its superiority over the first (which isn't by much, mind you), because the first was excellent, and it had a huge hurdle to overcome. Terminator was a movie that was exceptional in its own right. Along came Terminator 2, which literally blew the first out of the water. RARE.Kung Fu Panda 2 didn't blow the first one out of the water, but, in my humble opinion, it was better. Why?1. The story was more involving, more captivating, more ""root for the good guy"" than the first.2. The visual imagery was spectacular. Heads and tails better than the first.3. The ""cute and compassionate"" factor that was prominent in the first was here again, but tenfold.4. The voice acting in the first seemed a bit forced, like they (all but Jack Black), were trying to overcome some type of ""uncomfortable"" bug. The voice acting in 2 was spot-on. In the first, I found myself consciously listening to the actors doing voice-overs. In the second, I found myself listening to the characters and not paying any attention to the voice acting, as a whole, at all. It was as if everyone came to this movie knowing exactly what they wanted to do and what was expected of them in achieving their goals.Jack Black proves that he is an extremely talented voice actor. He hit all his marks and then some. Angelina Jolie as Tigress, who was terrible in the first movie, was at the top of her game in 2. Jackie Chan as Monkey was the only one who still seemed to be a bit out of place, but overall, he came out shining, as well.I'm not one for 3D movies either, but the only one showing at the time I had available was the 3D version, and it was phenomenal, perfectly executed.Five stars! *****",5,Kung Fu Panda Too Hardcore!,1307491200,"06 8, 2011",2011,1799,"['not', 'often', 'sequel', 'can', 'outdo', 'predecessor', 'case', 'occurred', 'movie', 'however', 'even', 'more', 'rare', 'superiority', 'first', ""n't"", 'much', 'first', 'was', 'excellent', 'had', 'huge', 'hurdle', 'overcome', 'Terminator', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'exceptional', 'own', 'right', 'came', 'Terminator', '2', 'literally', 'blew', 'first', 'water', 'RARE.Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'first', 'one', 'out', 'water', 'humble', 'opinion', 'was', 'better', 'Why', '1', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'involving', 'more', 'captivating', 'more', 'root', 'good', 'guy', 'first.2', 'visual', 'imagery', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Heads', 'tails', 'better', 'first.3', 'cute', 'compassionate', 'factor', 'was', 'prominent', 'first', 'was', 'here', 'again', 'tenfold.4', 'voice', 'acting', 'first', 'seemed', 'bit', 'forced', 'Jack', 'Black', 'were', 'trying', 'overcome', 'type', 'uncomfortable', 'bug', 'voice', 'acting', '2', 'was', 'spot-on', 'first', 'found', 'consciously', 'listening', 'actors', 'doing', 'voice-overs', 'second', 'found', 'listening', 'characters', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'voice', 'acting', 'whole', 'was', 'everyone', 'came', 'movie', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'achieving', 'goals.Jack', 'Black', 'extremely', 'talented', 'voice', 'actor', 'hit', 'marks', 'then', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Tigress', 'who', 'was', 'terrible', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'top', 'game', '2', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Monkey', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'still', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'place', 'overall', 'came', 'out', 'shining', 'well.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', '3D', 'movies', 'only', 'one', 'showing', 'time', 'had', 'available', 'was', '3D', 'version', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'perfectly', 'executed.Five', 'stars', '*****']",N/A

The shading and detail of the characters are an enhancement to the 3D experience.I rarely comment on video content but as an adult viewer I was unimpressed by the storyline. IMO the film is geared for a young audience but conversely has a large amount of cartoon violence.ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:There is some crosstalk sprinkled throughout the film but most of it is barely noticeable by being hidden within objects.(crosstalk varies from system to system)MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different.

1200454,A1DJYI522AO1MN,B001HN690O,"Noah Arsenault ""Winter's Read""","[2, 2]","First off, a few character studies. The peacock villain, Lord Shen, was obsessed with power. He wanted to rule, and kung fu hindered his greed. His solution is to use a weapon of fire and metal to stop kung fu. He's an outcast son who, by trying to change his future like Oedipus of old, fulfilled it. He's full of bitterness and willing to destroy anything that gets in his way. Po, now the Dragon Warrior, faces two new challenges. One, to find ""inner peace."" Two, to save kung fu from Shen's ""cup that is never full."" He's haunted by visions from his past, and travels not only to save kung fu, but also to learn the secrets of his past. His connections with the furious five are growing, and they form a much stronger team. I love it when Po offers Shen the chance to be a new person, and offers forgiveness. How it ends is for you to see. These and other characters were great, and showed off some fun acting. The movie was full of chuckling humor, despite a couple cheesy lines.The animation was amazing, to say the least. The 3D worked really well, with all the fighting and stunts. I really liked the diverse use of animation, with the 3D, the flat cartoon-like images, and the shadow puppets. The new range of animals, including gorillas, goats, peacocks, and a croc, was very satisfying as well. As in the first film, the fight scenes were wonderfully thought up and animated. In one particular fight scene, the music was timed precisely with each of the blows and bumps, creating a really cool experience. This describes all the music composed for this film by Hans Zimmer and John Powell. I heartily enjoyed all of the music.Now for the movie's effectiveness as a sequel. Unlike many companies, Dreamworks wisely planned for this movie even before releasing the first, and organized the plot around it. That was a key that made it successful. Plan ahead, far ahead. I love it when a sequel works as this one does. In the plot of saving kung fu, with the subplot of finding out about his past, Po took watchers through a wonderful adventure. They even left a cliffhanger, which gives me hope that they had also planned for a third. However, along with that are a few concerns. First, I worry that they thought up this cliffhanger on the spot, and haven't planned far ahead. I want the third movie to be as much (if not more) of a success as this one was. Second, based on the cliffhanger, it may occur that the third movie takes the focus away from kung fu, and expands the ""Po's past"" theme to be the main show. This would be a disaster.Now for my final recommendation. This movie is slightly darker than the first, and is more intense. Not that it isn't for kids anymore. Kids, I believe, will still enjoy this movie, maybe even more than the first. There is no language, and no inappropriate references or behavior. All the humor is clean, and actually funny.

1200455,AHF97M45JFCB,B001HN690O,ONENEO,"[1, 1]","In my opinion DreamWorks has always played second fiddle to Pixar in the computer generated feature film genre.  Their rivalry has existed for nearly as long as there has been a computer generated feature film genre! Pixar had Toy Story, DreamWorks had Small Soldiers. Pixar had A Bug's Life, DreamWorks Antz. Pixar Monsters Inc., DreamWorks Monsters Vs. Aliens.  Pixar with Cars and DreamWorks with Trucks.  No wait, I made that last one up.  But you get the idea.It seems to me like DreamWorks' best efforts are the ones that don't have a direct Pixar counterpart: The Shrek saga and How to Train Your Dragon to mention a few.  I am of the stance that 2008's Kung-Fu Panda perfectly represents this phenomenon of high-quality DreamWorks originality.What we had there was a bit of tribute to the Kung-Fu classics with a lot of unexpected character charm to cement the intense action sequences and lovely visuals.  When I heard a sequel was in the works, I naturally feared for the worst.  Generally speaking sequels in the CG film arena are hit or miss (with emphasis on miss).  Ever see Space Chimps 2, Hoodwinked 2 or Open Season 2 (or even scarier, Open Season 3)?  Sure you have your Shreks & Toy Stories but more often than not it seems to me that animation studios have a hard time recapturing the magic of the originals; especially when the original contains the ever-illusive element of heart.That said Kung-Fu Panda 2, riding on the success of the first one, was given a budget increase to the tune of 20-mil ($150,000,000 versus 130,000,000), brought back all of the key members of the original cast (with a few new ones) and even retained the vast majority of the production & animator crew.  To summarize, DreamWorks made darn sure not to risk losing said heart of the first film.  Did they succeed? For the most part absolutely.  Viewers looking for something more grandiose may be disappointed but the good news here is that Kung-Fu Panda 2 succeeds at feeling more like a continuation of the first film than it does a genuine sequel.  And considering the first film ended in such a manner where a sequel wasn't necessary, this is a very good thing indeed.Jack Black reprises his role as the titular overweight martial-arts trainee panda and his entire Furious Five retinue return uninterrupted (Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross)). Series staples Dustin Hoffman as Po's master Shifu and James Hong as Po's noodle-peddling dad return as well. The villain is new this time; a sociopath peacock named Shen, and played to perfection by Gary Oldman.  Other noteworthy additions include casting real-life karate aficionado Jean-Claude Van Damme to play Master Croc.The story takes us back to the visually lush Valley of Peace and finds a newfound camaraderie between Po and his Furious Five cohorts.  At just about the same time Po suddenly realizes that he bears (no pun intended, for now) no physical resemblance to his dad, the villainous Shen surfaces with a weapon of mass destruction and plans to conquer all of China.In terms of scope, the bar has been raised slightly but it's clear that the focus here was to expand upon the character back-stories and their interaction with one another over expanding geographically strictly for the sake of spending some of that additional 20-mil.The plot thickens slightly once Po realizes Shen's ambitions and the fact that he doesn't remember his birth parents aren't completely unrelated occurrences.  Unfortunately though, canceling out the slightly deeper plot structure of the sequel is the fact that Po's clumsy, lighthearted enthusiasm seems somehow misplaced now that he has been revealed a psychologically scarred Kung Fu disciple.Pacing is decent, if a bit longer feeling than the first, though all in all the 90-minute runtime does go by fairly quickly since no time need be wasted setting up backgrounds for our heroes.  Hans Zimmer nails the musical score with his trademarked near-subliminally perfect melodies and heart thumping action accompaniments.In all Kung-Fu Panda joins a pretty slim gathering of titles that actually manage to do the concept of a sequel justice.  While it could be argued that DreamWorks played it safe by failing to stray from the path established in the first one, at least they knew not to fix what wasn't broken.  The old phrase, ""it's not as original as the original"" certainly applies as well but here's hoping the formula continues to stay fresh as DreamWorks has stated they hope to milk this into a 6-movie franchise.  Will fans tire of Po's antics through four more films? There's a swamp-dwelling big green ogre who thinks not.",4,A Worthy Continuation of the First,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,4710,"['opinion', 'DreamWorks', 'always', 'played', 'second', 'fiddle',

It expands on what I wanted to know about.Po the panda (Jack Black) now faces the peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who has invented the cannon to destroy kung fu and conquer China. When the panda and the Furious Five first square off with Shen's wolf bandit underlings, Po starts having flashbacks because of the symbols on the head wolf's armor. And so Po must come to terms with his past if he is to ever find inner peace and defeat Shen. This leads to some truly great moments between Jack Black's Po and James Hong's Mr. Ping, Po's adoptive goose dad.I'd say that Lord Shen is a better villain than the first film's Tai Lung, because he gets to do much more. There are a number a scenes with him and the soothsayer character (Michelle Yeoh), where her words cause a pressing uncertainty to become clear in his face. Oldman's acting makes Shen's insecurity apparent from beginning to end. I was pretty miffed at what ultimately happened to him though, and there was never really a satisfying final battle between him and Po. He's a memorable character, and I wouldn't mind him appearing in future Panda films (because this one does set itself up for a third).There's a lot more action than in the original Kung Fu Panda, too much more, and in places where it didn't need to be. It was sometimes totally hectic, sometimes ""wow out loud"" spectacular, sometimes it found dizzying ways to show us the detailed, atmospheric CG world, all the while Po and the Five using their techniques in tandem. There were times where I found the fight to be going on for far too long, the sequence accomplishing very little. They could have used this time to deal with the various characters. Only Tigress of the Furious Five truly has a relationship with Po; Viper, Mantis, Monkey, and Crane are just kind of there. One of the best aspects of Kung Fu Panda was Po and Shifu's (Dustin Hoffman) relationship. Unfortunately, the kung fu master is hardly in this film.This is a pretty funny movie. It's certainly not as funny as the original, as there's a lot more of the ""cheap sight gags"", and just less laughs in general. Kung Fu Panda managed to find moments that were at once heartwarming yet obviously comedic in a way that made me smile. Here the comedy is usually more straightforward. There are still great moments though, some of Shen's stuff for instance, and Jack Black makes Po as funny and lovable as ever.So there you have it, I found Kung Fu Panda 2 to be a competent movie and a good sequel that doesn't tread old ground.7 out of 10",3,"Solid, but disappointing.",1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,2680,"['do', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'movie.There', 'said', 'it.But', 'okay', 'do', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2.This', 'sequel', 'relevant', 'what', 'wanted', 'know', 'panda', 'Jack', 'Black', 'now', 'peacock', 'Lord', 'Shen', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'invented', 'cannon', 'destroy', 'kung', 'fu', 'conquer', 'China', 'When', 'panda', 'Furious', 'Five', 'first', 'square', 'off', 'Shen', 'wolf', 'bandit', 'underlings', 'Po', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'symbols', 'head', 'wolf', 'armor', 'so', 'Po', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'past', 'ever', 'find', 'inner', 'peace', 'defeat', 'Shen', 'truly', 'great', 'moments', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Po', 'James', 'Hong', 'Mr.', 'Ping', 'Po', 'adoptive', 'goose', 'dad.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'Lord', 'Shen', 'better', 'villain', 'first', 'film', 'Tai', 'Lung', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'soothsayer', 'character', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'where', 'words', 'cause', 'pressing', 'uncertainty', 'become', 'clear', 'face', 'Oldman', 'acting', 'Shen', 'insecurity', 'apparent', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'miffed', 'what', 'ultimately', 'happened', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'satisfying', 'final', 'battle', 'Po', 'memorable', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'appearing', 'future', 'Panda', 'films', 'one', 'set', 'up', 'third', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'original', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'places', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'was', 'sometimes', 'totally', 'hectic', 'sometimes', 'wow', 'out', 'loud', 'spectacular', 'found', 'dizzying', 'ways', 'show', 'detailed', 'atmospheric', 'CG', 'world', 'while', 'Po', 'Five', 'using', 'techniques', 'tandem', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'found', 'fight', 'be', 'going', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'sequence', 'accomplishing', 'very', 'little', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'time', 'deal', 'various', 'characters', 'Only', 'Tigress', 'Furious', 'Five', 'truly', 'relationship', 'Po', 'Viper', 'Mantis', 'Monkey', 'Crane', 'are', 'just', 'kind', 'there', 'One', 'best', 'aspects', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'was', 'Po', 'Shifu', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'relationship', 'Unfortunately', 'kung', 'fu', 'master', 'hardly', 'film.This', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'original', 'lot', 'more', 'cheap', 'sight', 'gags', 'just', 'less', 'laughs', 'general', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'managed', 'find', 'moments', 'were', 'once', 'heartwarming', 'yet', 'obviously', 'comedic', 'way', 'made', 'smile', 'Here', 'comedy', 'usually', 'more', 'straightforward', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'moments', 'Shen', 'stuff', 'instance', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Po', 'funny', 'lovable', 'ever.So', 'have', 'found', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'be', 'competent', 'movie', 'good', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'tread', 'old', 'ground.7', '10']",N/A
1200464,A2GE1QIP9RJHZI,B001HN690O,"R. Calderon ""The Duck Knight Rises""","[2, 2]","How do you qualify the success of a sequel? Is it whether the film matches or outperforms the original at the box office? Is it an improvement of artistic merit? Or is it taking the sequel in a slightly new direction and succeeding? Kung Fu Panda 2 may be the first animated sequel to answer each of those questions in the minds of each viewer.Not long after Po (voiced by Jack Black) became the Dragon Warrior and, with the assistance of the Furious Five, saved the kingdom from the escaped snow leopard Tai Lung, the portly panda wears his fame on his sleeve. Never letting those around him forget who is the most powerful kung fu warrior alive. His father has even begun using his son's fame as a selling tool for his own noodle shop. Yet, when a new force threatens the Valley of Peace, Po joins forces with Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) to wrest control from the mad, white peacock Shen (Gary Oldman). Also back to serve up advice and set Po on his journey is Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a diminutive Grand Master struggling to find in himself inner peace.Simple as the plot may sound, a challenging execution lays before Jennifer Yuh, a first-time big screen director who has worked in storyboarding and artistic design on film since 1994. Yuh takes the screenplay by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger and their team of writers and gives turns it into a gorgeous, poetic vision of ancient China with rich symbolism, gorgeous scenery and a magnificent series of flashbacks, including the opening sequence, employing various colorful gears to tell the story of Shen's origin. Having received a prophecy that he will be defeated by a creature of black and white, Shen begins a campaign to slaughter every panda alive in an effort to stave off his demise. His treachery and violence lead his loving and peaceful parents to exile him. Adding immeasurably to the magnificent visuals of the opening Michelle Yeoh's wonderful narration adds an beautiful layer of depth.We know from the first film that Po's father Mr. Ping (Jame Hong) is not his natural father. A goose having a panda cub child? But the film didn't go into great depth about Po's origin leaving a terrific opening for the sequel. In order to find the inner peace he will need in order to defeat Shen, Po must calm the storms in his heart and uncover the truth about his parents and how he came to be the adoptive son of a goose. The flashback scenes peppered throughout the present tense action colorfully unveil his history, revealing a stark and tragic history that allows the audience to form an emotional connection with Po that they may not have had in the original film.The voice work has changed little since the original film, but adding in Oldman's machinations as the voice of Shen was a stroke of genius. For several years, Oldman has softened his image, giving the audience a glimpse of the more compassionate side of his craft. With roles in the Harry Potter films as Harry's compassionate father and in the Batman films as the kindly Lieutenant Gordon, I had become concerned that we might forever lose the richness of character he could bring to a villainous role. Kung Fu Panda revives my faith in him as an actor. Shen is a cold-hearted villain like few others, but his vocal talents lend an air of menace the film might not have had with a lesser actor in the role. His voice work makes this one of his finest performances in years.Not since Toy Story 2 has there been an animated sequel that has improved upon the original. Tonally, Kung Fu Panda 2 is quite a bit darker than its comedy-laden first feature, but that's to the benefit of the film. While it has many light moments that give the audience occasion to smile, adding too much levity to a story of such gravity would have been dangerous. They have created the perfect balance. It might not be the joyous production a lot of kids will enjoy, this film will appeal mostly to the adults whose support has frequently made Pixar the envy of the animation industry. While I doubt that Pixar can easily be supplanted as the best animation house in film history, DreamWorks is making the case that it isn't some fly-by-night, box office-at-all-costs studio like rival Fox.With the Panda films and How to Train Your Dragon, I'm no longer afraid to sit down to a DreamWorks animated feature expecting to be annoyed by how childish it is, because I'm no longer likely to be so disappointed.",5,Kung Fu Panda 2 Kicks Right Back Into Your Heart,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,4494,"['How', 'do', 'qualify', 'success', 'sequel', 'film', 'matches', 'original', 'box',

1200466,A39W3263A9HCMN,B001HN690O,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[2, 4]","I guess I will have to make a confession that will get the Dreamworks crowd all worked up: while I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda, I'm not one of the many who hold it up on as high a pedestal as the superior Monsters Vs. Aliens or the movie that may be the epitome of all things cute, How to Train Your Dragon. So nail me to the cross if you want. I also have, in recent times, developed a distaste for sequels. This year we had Pixar's first terrible movie (Cars 2), the disastrously messy Pirates 4, and the carbon copy Hangover 2 (though Deathly Hallows Part 2 is my pick for top movie of 2011)So while I, as I stated, enjoyed KFP1, I initially had low expectations for it's sequel in place. And with that in mind, I can say I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda 2. Although it's not perfect, it managed to be very entertaining, and a worthy follow up.The sequel takes place some time after the first movie. Po has continued training to be a true Kung Fu master, but there's one thing he hasn't yet truly mastered: inner peace. Of course, to a panda like Po, Kung Fu is all about kicking butt, but he soon learns that the only way to be a true Kung Fu master is to be at peace with himself. However, a new gang, sent in by a Peacock who seems a ghost of Po's past, has terrorized the village, sending Po and the gang on an adventure to stop him.Kung Fu Panda 2 works... for the most part. The good news is, it overall provides for an entertaining ride that the whole family can enjoy. The script is filled with tons of funny lines that are bound to have the kids repeating them for hours on end. As well as the voice cast is just as charming this time around; Jack Black still manages to charm as Po, Angelina Jolie still manages to put her street tough kick to good use. However, Gary Oldman, as usual, steals the show. He makes a great villain andit shows.The animation also manages to dazzle. I can safely say that the animation quality has come a long way since Shrek. I didn't see this in 3D, but I guarantee I would have loved to. There are a lot of moments in the animation where I wanted to reach out and run my fingers through Po's fur, or move my hand along the cannon near the end, and had I seen this movie in 3D, I probably would have reached out and tried to feel them! It reminded me of when I saw Sanctum in 3D earlier this year, where I felt like I was actually underwater.However there are a few flaws that prevent me from calling it a perfect film, let alone near perfect. For starters, it took me a while to be able to connect with the movie, as the pacing unfortunately is rushed to the point where it moves at a machine gun pace. Thepacing does slighty slow down in the middle but even then, the film still feels like the filmmakers were trying to cram too much in. Also, the story seemed convoluted. There was a story but it was rushed, to the point where I had myself questioning halfway through the film what the movie was about.Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very enjoyable film that is not without it's flaws. I would say go into it with an open mind, and don't expect Pixar level entertainment. Oh, and even if you don't go to movies for the actors, it's still worth seeing for Gary Oldman alone.Overall: 7/10Pros: The film provides good action, humour, laughs, alongside a stellar voice cast, a terrific Hans Zimmer score and beautiful animation that would convince even 3D skeptics to buy a ticket.Cons: The film's pacing is rushed, to the near point of being disorienting, as well as the story could have been more fleshed out as well as the villain.",4,A sequel with real kick,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,3560,"['guess', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'confession', 'will', 'get', 'Dreamworks', 'crowd', 'worked', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'high', 'pedestal', 'superior', 'Monsters', 'Vs.', 'Aliens', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'epitome', 'things', 'cute', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'So', 'nail', 'cross', 'want', 'also', 'have', 'recent', 'times', 'developed', 'distaste', 'sequels', 'year', 'had', 'Pixar', 'first', 'terrible', 'movie', 'Cars', '2', 'disastrously', 'messy', 'Pirates', '4', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Hangover', '2', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '2', 'pick', 'top', 'movie', '2011', 'stated', 'enjoyed', 'KFP1', 'initially', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'sequel', 'place', 'mind', 'can', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'not', 'perfect', 'managed', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'worthy', 'follow', 'up.The', 'sequel', 'place', 'time', 'first', 'movie', 'Po', 'continued', 'training', 'be', 'true', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'master', 'one', 'thing', ""n't"", 'yet', 'truly', 'mastered', 'inner', 'peace', 'course', 'panda', 'Po', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'kicking', 'butt', 'soon', 'only', 'way', 'be', 'true', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'master', 'be', 'peace', 'However', 'new', 'gang', 'sent', 'Peacock', 'who', 'ghost', 'Po', 'past', 'terrorized', 'village', 'sending', 'Po', 'gang', 'adventure', 'stop', 'him.Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'works', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'news', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'script', 'filled', 'tons', 'funny', 'lines', 'are', 'bound', 'have', 'kids', 'repeating', 'hours', 'end', 'As', 'well', 'voice', 'cast', 'just', 'charming', 'time', 'around', 'Jack', 'Black', 'still', 'charm', 'Po', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'still', 'put', 'street', 'tough', 'kick', 'good', 'use', 'However', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'usual', 'show', 'great', 'villain', 'shows.The', 'animation', 'also', 'dazzle', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'animation', 'quality', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Shrek', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '3D', 'guarantee', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'are', 'lot', 'moments', 'animation', 'where', 'wanted', 'reach', 'out', 'run', 'fingers', 'Po', 'fur', 'move', 'hand', 'cannon', 'end', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', '3D', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'reached', 'out', 'tried', 'feel', 'reminded', 'when', 'saw', 'Sanctum', '3D', 'earlier', 'year', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'actually', 'underwater.However', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'prevent', 'calling', 'perfect', 'film', 'let', 'alone', 'perfect', 'starters', 'took', 'while', 'be', 'able', 'connect', 'movie', 'pacing', 'unfortunately', 'rushed', 'point', 'where', 'machine', 'gun', 'pace', 'Thepacing', 'slighty', 'slow', 'down', 'middle', 'even', 'then', 'film', 'still', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'Also', 'story', 'seemed', 'convoluted', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'rushed', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'questioning', 'halfway', 'film', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about.Overall', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'would', 'say', 'go', 'open', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Pixar', 'level', 'entertainment', 'Oh', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'actors', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'alone.Overall', '7/10Pros', 'film', 'good', 'action', 'humour', 'alongside', 'stellar', 'voice', 'cast', 'terrific', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'would', 'convince', 'even', '3D', 'skeptics', 'buy', 'ticket.Cons', 'film', 'pacing', 'rushed', 'near', 'point', 'being', 'disorienting', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'villain']",N/A

1200468,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B001HN690O,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","Where do I begin? For starters, I have to say that Kung Fu Panda 2 (formerly called ""The Kaboom of Doom"") outdid its predecessor in every way, in my opinion, except for maybe laughs. And that's saying a mouthful because I love the first film. Kung Fu Panda is one of my favorite animated films, so I was very eagerly awaiting this one's release. I can honestly say I don't mind the lack of big laughs one bit. I never really found the first very funny either. Its humor cater has always catered more to a demographic that's quite a few years behind me anyway. That being said, I still do laugh a few times whenever I pop the first one in, and not so much with the sequel. Nevertheless, genuine heart fills the void that the lack of substantial comedy left behind. Kung Fu Panda 2 has an extra dosage of emotional oomph that many animated films strive for, but rarely achieve. Meaning it leaves a mark on you, making you feel sorry for our lead, Po (Jack Black). After How To Train Your Dragon, I knew DreamWorks was on the right path to eventually being close to, if not on par with Pixar. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the films in their library, but there's an obvious difference between an everlasting classic film and a simply entertaining one. How To Train Your Dragon and Kung Fu Panda 2 have officially allowed DreamWorks to attain the former two years in a row. Now what's a kung fu movie with exciting fight scenes?The kung fu is aplenty in Kung Fu Panda 2, and the sequences are spectacular. Needless to say, the action is thrilling. The choreography is very well done, albeit a little difficult to make out the first couple of times you watch the film. I can confidently say that this is one of my favorite kung fu movies. To be fair, I'm not well versed in the subgenre, so maybe m claim means little. The characters are so natural and believable. Top notch voice work by the entire cast. Jack Black really cares about Po, and it shows. His subtly is sublime. Every little nuance in his voice comes through and clearly translates to create our lovable hero Po. These animation studios are really getting good at facial tweaks, especially the eyes. There's so much soul and life behind the characters' eyes. Besides Jack Black, there is a stellar group of names including: Dustin Hoffman returning as the wise Yoda-like Shifu (even down to the walking stick - Master Oogway's staff) , Angelina Jolie as Tigress the fearless leader of the Furious Five, Seth Rogen as Mantis (showing even more growth in his voice work talent), Lucy Liu as Viper, David Cross as Crane, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and James Hong as Mr. Ping, rounding out the returning support. The newcomers are Gary Oldman playing yet another villain to perfection in Shen, the always funny (but more menacing in this case) Danny McBride as the one-eyed Wolf Boss, Dennis Haysbert as a commanding Master Ox, and the only other kung fu legend in the film besides Chan, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc.I'm a big fan of animated movies, and as an artist I took note of the various creative ways that the scenes were painted onto the canvas, or screen. One major strength I loved about Kung Fu Panda was how beautifully they used colors and shapes to tell the story. The sequel is no different. The scenery in this movie pops to perfection in each of its different striking art styles. Be it classic and drawn-esque, or state of the art CGI, this movie is simply a beautiful sight to behold. The color palette is darker than the first because the story is darker. This sequel takes our characters down an Empire Strikes Back, Temple of Doom sort of path. These characters that we grew to love in the light-hearted, fun first entries must then go to new lengths - emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually - in the sequels. In this film, Po get tested in ways that I never expected a character as care-free, adventurous, and fun loving to be. Kung Fu Panda 2 revolves around him learning to master the ancient art of inner peace, a lesson that doesn't come easily to put it lightly. Simply put, I loved it. Once again, the Hans Zimmer and John Powell's score adds a lot to the visuals, which are amazing. We've come to expect nothing short of the best A/V presentations from animated releases, and I am happy to say that Kung Fu Panda 2 delivers. Truly a top notch release in pretty much every department.

The first plot involves an evil peacock named Shen. He threatens to destroy kung fu with a cannon. It is up to Po and Furious Five to save kung fu and stop Shen's evil ways. it is established in the first movie that Po's father is a goose named Ping. A goose can't be the father of a panda. This movie explores Po's roots further and answers the question of what really happened to Po's parents. Po is the dragon master, but he is advised by Master Shi fu to find inner peace. This quest for inner peace gives this film a spiritual quality the first film did not have. Po learns that it does not matter how a panda starts out in life. The important thing to remember how a panda chooses to be and live his life in the present. This lesson can also be applied to people as well.Gary Oldman provides the voice of Shen. His movements are quick and graceful. I love watching Shen move especially in the fight sequences. Oldman's voice work is very good here. Jack Black is equally excellent providing the voice of Po. He is so funny in one scene trying to eat as many dumplings as he can. He is fun to watch fighting wolves or dodging blasts from Shen's cannon. Dustin Hoffman provides the voice of Master Shih Fu.

In Kung Fu Panda 2, we follow Poe as he and the furious five try to stop Lord Shen from taking over China. Not only do they have to stop Shen but they have to destroy a weapon that can destroy them no matter how talented they are with Kung Fu. The story was very predictable and included many cliches. There was not as many jokes and those that were there were not very funny. The Kung Fu and fighting was excellent but that cannot make a movie. I didn't really care about the characters. I only cared for Poe and the Big Rhino Guy with the hammer. I still recommend going to see this movie because you should form your own opinion. I think your younger kids will enjoy this movie but your older ones will not. The animations on this movie are just fantastic. The animations are just so smooth and crisip.

1200486,A40CCH74MOWE2,B001HN690O,T. D. Welsh,"[1, 2]","Well, I took my family to see Kung Fu Panda 2, and we all thought it was at least as good as the first film. It is engrossing, touching, clever, and much of the time absolutely hilarious. We had seen that the critics all panned it, and had high hopes because they are quite often wrong. Of course, it depends on how you judge these things. A lot of the surprise element is inevitably lost now that we know Po is, indeed, the Dragon Warrior in spite of his ungainly appearance and humble behaviour. And it must have been hard for the director and scriptwriters to define his new status vis a vis Shifu and the Furious Five. Furthermore - as a lot of comments here have pointed out - how on earth could they follow an act as supremely vicious and powerful as Ian McShane's Tai Lung?All those problems are resolved in Kung Fu Panda 2 - and, I think, very satisfactorily indeed. The main dramatic engine is, of course, the villain, and Gary Oldman's rendering of the peacock Lord Shen is right up there with McShane's performance as Tai Lung. True, the peacock is not a supreme Kung Fu fighter - although he is pretty good - but he over-compensates for that by introducing mechanisation. Cleverly exploiting the fact that gunpowder and fireworks were first invented in China, the writers conceive the happy idea of making Shen set up a full-fledged production line devoted to turning out huge cannon. As Shifu and others explain, Shen's artillery has the potential to overthrow Kung Fu for once and for all - so Po and the Furious Five are fighting, not just for themselves, their friends, and the people of a conquered city, but to maintain the supremacy of their religion and their way of life. Necessarily - because cannon do not make or haul themselves - Shen commands a sizeable army of wolves and gorillas (which appear to have flat-top haircuts suggestive of the US military). So, although personally less scary than Tai Lung, he is a far more formidable enemy.Within the constraints of a 91-minute film, an incredible amount of action takes place. After an efficient scene-setting, in which we see Shen's falling-out with his parents and his determination to seek revenge even beyond the grave, Po and the Five are dispatched by Shifu to deal with Shen and his miscellaneous artifacts and henchthings. Meanwhile, Po reflects (in his copious free time) on the task Shifu has set him: to seek ""Inner Peace"". Hugely outnumbered, at a great disadvantage because of Shen's artillery, and even out-thought by the wily bird, the friends seem to be up against it. But, needless to say, at the exactly perfect moment everything comes together for Po... Meanwhile the jokes come thick and fast - although you will perhaps find the film more amusing if you enjoy running gags, of which there are plenty.It is certainly true that Kung Fu Panda 2 is darker, and there is mention of death. Indeed, it is central to the psychological aspect of the plot, as Po finds out more about where he came from and his parents. However, I noticed that the almost-empty cinema contained several small children - one little girl of perhaps five was sitting directly behind us with her father - and I didn't see any evidence of fear or unhappiness. Indeed, the tiny child behind us was volubly enthusiastic at the end, telling her father what a wonderful movie it had been and how much she enjoyed it. I think you have to give DreamWorks credit for knowing what people of all ages like and don't like. For all but determined critics, then, I think you will find Kung Fu Panda 2 a worthy sequel and perhaps, in some ways, even better than the first.",5,Even better than the first!,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,3623,"['Well', 'took', 'family', 'see', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'thought', 'was', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'engrossing', 'touching', 'clever', 'much', 'time', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'had', 'seen', 'critics', 'panned', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'are', 'quite', 'often', 'wrong', 'course', 'how', 'judge', 'things', 'lot', 'surprise', 'element', 'inevitably', 'lost', 'now', 'know', 'Po', 'indeed', 'Dragon', 'Warrior', 'spite', 'ungainly', 'appearance', 'humble', 'behaviour', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'director', 'scriptwriters', 'define', 'new', 'status', 'vis', 'vis', 'Shifu', 'Furious', 'Five', 'Furthermore', 'lot', 'comments', 'here', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'earth', 'could', 'follow', 'act', 'supremely', 'vicious', 'powerful', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Tai', 'Lung', 'problems', 'are', 'resolved', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'think', 'very', 'satisfactorily', 'indeed', 'main', 'dramatic', 'engine', 'course', 'villain', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'rendering', 'peacock', 'Lord', 'Shen', 'right', 'there', 'McShane', 'performance', 'Tai', 'Lung', 'True', 'peacock', 'not', 'supreme', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'fighter', 'pretty', 'good', 'introducing', 'mechanisation', 'Cleverly', 'exploiting', 'fact', 'gunpowder', 'fireworks', 'were', 'first', 'invented', 'China', 'writers', 'conceive', 'happy', 'idea', 'making', 'Shen', 'set', 'up', 'full-fledged', 'production', 'line', 'devoted', 'turning', 'out', 'huge', 'cannon', 'Shifu', 'others', 'explain', 'Shen', 'artillery', 'potential', 'overthrow', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'once', 'so', 'Po', 'Furious', 'Five', 'are', 'fighting', 'not', 'just', 'friends', 'people', 'conquered', 'city', 'maintain', 'supremacy', 'religion', 'way', 'life', 'Necessarily', 'cannon', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'haul', 'Shen', 'sizeable', 'army', 'wolves', 'gorillas', 'appear', 'have', 'flat-top', 'haircuts', 'suggestive', 'US', 'military', 'So', 'personally', 'less', 'scary', 'Tai', 'Lung', 'far', 'more', 'formidable', 'constraints', '91-minute', 'film', 'incredible', 'amount', 'action', 'place', 'efficient', 'scene-setting', 'see', 'Shen', 'falling-out', 'parents', 'determination', 'seek', 'revenge', 'even', 'grave', 'Po', 'Five', 'are', 'dispatched', 'Shifu', 'deal', 'Shen', 'miscellaneous', 'artifacts', 'henchthings', 'Meanwhile', 'Po', 'copious', 'free', 'time', 'task', 'Shifu', 'set', 'seek', 'Inner', 'Peace', 'Hugely', 'outnumbered', 'great', 'disadvantage', 'Shen', 'artillery', 'even', 'out-thought', 'wily', 'bird', 'friends', 'seem', 'be', 'up', 'needless', 'say', 'exactly', 'perfect', 'moment', 'everything', 'together', 'Po', 'Meanwhile', 'jokes', 'come', 'thick', 'fast', 'will', 'perhaps', 'find', 'film', 'more', 'amusing', 'enjoy', 'running', 'gags', 'are', 'plenty.It', 'certainly', 'true', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'darker', 'mention', 'death', 'Indeed', 'central', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'plot', 'Po', 'out', 'more', 'where', 'came', 'parents', 'However', 'noticed', 'almost-empty', 'cinema', 'contained', 'several', 'small', 'children', 'one', 'little', 'girl', 'perhaps', 'five', 'was', 'sitting', 'directly', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'evidence', 'fear', 'unhappiness', 'Indeed', 'tiny', 'child', 'was', 'volubly', 'enthusiastic', 'end', 'telling', 'father', 'what', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'have', 'give', 'DreamWorks', 'credit', 'knowing', 'what', 'people', 'ages', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'determined', 'critics', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'perhaps', 'ways', 'even', 'better', 'first']",N/A

Dreamworks COULD of made a poor sequel, and people would of seen it. Fortunately, Kung Fu Panda 2 is one of those RARE sequels that actually is BETTER than the original.The second film starts out with Po (Jack Black), he is now the Dragon Warrior, along with the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) are reprising their voices to these characters. Now, they have to go against a new villain named Lorn Shen (Gary Oldman) who is going into the villages and taking anything metal with him and his goons.Yet, there is something interesting about Lord Shen that Po see's; it's a symbol that Po has seen before, but he is not quite sure of what it means, but Po thinks it has something to do with his parents. After some asking from his dad Mr. Ping (James Hong), he tells Po what happened.As the story progresses, it turns out that Lorn Shen has a weapon, and has evil plans for this weapon, so now it's Po and the Furious Five's job to stop Lorn Shen.This film is aimed at kids, but adults can enjoy it too; I went to go see this with my fianc&eacute;e opening night, and not only did she love it, but I loved it too. The writing is excellent, the animation is a mix of 3D and hand-drawn animation (a couple of scenes here and there are hand-drawn, and even they look excellent), it's funny when it needs to be funny, it's touching when it needs to be touching, and overall, this is a good film.

1200490,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001HN690O,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 1]","My review's going to take a little bit of a different direction so please, bear (get it?) with me.Adoption usually gets some bad press in movies; if something goes horribly wrong or some person has an annoying tendency it might just be because they're adopted.  Adoption also is the butt of some admittedly funny jokes here and there but the driving point is still that there is something ""wrong"" with the adopted person and so adoption, no matter how noble, is an ultimately doomed endeavor.How frustrating to the hundreds of thousands, millions even, of people who have adopted or been adopted and who are loved and loving.  Adopted or not we all have our faults.  So it is always refreshing to see a movie that doesn't just have a positive spin on adoption but whose adoption plot is an important feature of the movie.  And that's something that we have in Kung Fu Panda 2.  The somewhat dim Po, the lovable titular Panda voiced by Jack Black, is feeling the distance between he and his father goose (yes, literally his father is a goose for those of you who haven't seen this film).  Po loves and is loved by his dad, but he has questions about where he came from and what his biological parents were like and why they couldn't or didn't keep him.  These questions are answered over story's course and the villain this time around, a peacock (voiced by Gary Oldman) whose hidden blades and secrets of gunpoweder are far worse than his bite...er, peck, figures strongly into Po's biological backstory.The violence and some of the heavier emotional tones make this a movie that perhaps is not a great fit for those under 6 although they would be pleased with it visually.  The heavier tones can be felt throughout with the darker color palettes chosen; there are ominous skies filled with dark billious smoke throughout and our heroes often find themselves operating in the twilight and nighttime hours where deep reds and oranges, and darker purples and shades of black abound.  This contrasts significantly with the first feature with its light and sun-soaked qualities.  Also this time around the humor is more forced and it's not quite as funny but I never found the first feature to be a laugh-fest mind you, just a movie that constantly put a smile on my face that stayed there for long periods of time.  By contrast this movie has more ""funny"" moments and one-liners, and Michelle Yeoh's character Soothsayer the goat has some of the funniest moments with her calm precognitive knowing which constantly upsets our bad peacock.Overall this is a movie that could be a family favorite.

The music is also awesome, heck I've listened to its soundtrack a million times!

1200499,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B001HN690O,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[33, 38]","When it comes to sequels, it's rare enough that one manages to measure up to the first film.  More often than not they end up being disappointing to one degree or another. Particularly when you're talking about animated films (the Shrek and Toy Story films being more the exception than the rule).  But Kung Fu Panda 2 is that rarity among sequels in that, in my opinion, it is actually an improvement on the first film in quite a number of ways, which I'll get to later.In this film, Po (the kung-fu panda of the title) and the Furious Five (Tigress, Mantis, Monkey, Viper & Crane) are called on to face a new threat:  the return of the exiled Prince Shen (a peacock), who has come back armed with a powerful new weapon and determined to take over the kingdom. Complicating matters though are the fact that Prince Shen apparently had something to do with how Po, a panda, came to be raised by a goose, Mister Ping, his loving if noodle-obsessed father. In order to find the 'inner peace' he needs to defeat Shen, Po must first find the secret of his past, a past that he only sees in flashes of haunting memory that Shen's appearance has awakened in him.Beyond the plot though, almost everything in Kung Fu Panda 2 is better than the first film, which was already pretty respectable to begin with. One thing is that KFP2 steeps itself even deeper in Chinese culture and it shows in both the sumptuously colored and detailed art of the backgrounds, in the traditions subtly brought out in the story, and even in the musical score wrought by John Powell and Hans Zimmer. And there is more depth, both philosophically and artistically, to the kung-fu; a particular key sequence by Master Shifu early on is a slow and beautiful thing to watch.The voice actors are all excellent, with all of the original actors reprising their roles:  Po (Jack Black), Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross) and of course Mister Ping (the inimitable veteran James Hong). New additions include a sooth-saying ram (beautifully done by Michelle Yeoh), and kung-fu masters Croc (Jean-Claude Vam Damme) and Ox (Dennis Haysbert). And a notable cameo for film buffs is the voice of the Musician Bunny (director Paul Mazursky).I have to give particular praise though to how well Prince Shen was done. At first thought, the idea of a villainous peacock sounds, well, ridiculous. But Prince Shen, as conceived and dazzlingly executed by the animators of KFP2, and as masterfully voiced by Gary Oldman, radiates arrogant menace and threat, in attitude and physically, in a fashion that is both artful and deadly. Director Jennifer Yuh said that ""Shen proved to be a great challenge to animate, so much that the complexity of the character was like that of doing six characters all at once."" IMHO, KFP2 is worth seeing just for Shen alone.And, for what it's worth, this is one of the few 3D movies I've seen that was actually worth seeing in 3D.My only quibble with the film is that it really didn't develop the Furious Five much as characters, which I would like to have seen. There are hints of things given about Tigress, but they're never really developed, and the rest of the Five are relegated to the same hero-support roles they had in the original.Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good story and especially for anyone who liked the first film. This one definitely takes it up a notch.",4,A sequel that manages to be better than the first movie,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,3461,"['When', 'sequels', 'rare', 'enough', 'one', 'measure', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'disappointing', 'one', 'degree', 'Particularly', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', 'animated', 'films', 'Shrek', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'being', 'more', 'exception', 'rule', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'rarity', 'sequels', 'opinion', 'actually', 'improvement', 'first', 'film', 'quite', 'number', 'ways', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later.In', 'film', 'Po', 'kung-fu', 'panda', 'title', 'Furious', 'Five', 'Tigress', 'Mantis', 'Monkey', 'Viper', 'Crane', 'are', 'called', 'face', 'new', 'threat', 'return', 'exiled', 'Prince', 'Shen', 'peacock', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'armed', 'powerful', 'new', 'weapon', 'determined', 'take', 'over', 'kingdom', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'are', 'fact', 'Prince', 'Shen', 'apparently', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'how', 'Po', 'panda', 'came', 'be', 'raised', 'goose', 'Mister', 'Ping', 'loving', 'noodle-obsessed', 'father', 'order', 'find', ""'inner"", 'peace', 'defeat', 'Shen', 'Po', 'must', 'first', 'find', 'secret', 'past', 'past', 'only', 'flashes', 'haunting', 'memory', 'Shen', 'appearance', 'awakened', 'him.Beyond', 'plot', 'almost', 'everything', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'pretty', 'respectable', 'begin', 'One', 'thing', 'KFP2', 'even', 'deeper', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'sumptuously', 'colored', 'detailed', 'art', 'backgrounds', 'traditions', 'subtly', 'brought', 'out', 'story', 'even', 'musical', 'score', 'wrought', 'John', 'Powell', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'more', 'depth', 'philosophically', 'artistically', 'kung-fu', 'particular', 'key', 'sequence', 'Master', 'Shifu', 'early', 'slow', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'watch.The', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'original', 'actors', 'reprising', 'roles', 'Po', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Shifu', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Tigress', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Monkey', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Mantis', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Viper', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Crane', 'David', 'Cross', 'course', 'Mister', 'Ping', 'inimitable', 'veteran', 'James', 'Hong', 'New', 'additions', 'include', 'sooth-saying', 'ram', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'kung-fu', 'masters', 'Croc', 'Jean-Claude', 'Vam', 'Damme', 'Ox', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'notable', 'cameo', 'film', 'buffs', 'voice', 'Musician', 'Bunny', 'director', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'have', 'give', 'particular', 'praise', 'how', 'well', 'Prince', 'Shen', 'was', 'done', 'first', 'thought', 'idea', 'villainous', 'peacock', 'sounds', 'well', 'ridiculous', 'Prince', 'Shen', 'conceived', 'dazzlingly', 'executed', 'animators', 'KFP2', 'masterfully', 'voiced', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'arrogant', 'menace', 'threat', 'attitude', 'physically', 'fashion', 'artful', 'deadly', 'Director', 'Jennifer', 'Yuh', 'said', 'Shen', 'proved', 'be', 'great', 'challenge', 'animate', 'so', 'much', 'complexity', 'character', 'was', 'doing', 'six', 'characters', 'once', 'IMHO', 'KFP2', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'Shen', 'alone.And', 'what', 'worth', 'one', 'few', '3D', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'actually', 'worth', 'seeing', '3D.My', 'only', 'quibble', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'Furious', 'Five', 'much', 'characters', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'hints', 'things', 'given', 'Tigress', ""'re"", 'never', 'really', 'developed', 'rest', 'Five', 'are', 'relegated', 'same', 'hero-support', 'roles', 'had', 'original.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'first', 'film', 'one', 'definitely', 'up', 'notch']",N/A

The first KFP was so much fun, I was afraid they'd just do more of the same, to the point of too much. Instead, I got better than I bargained for.Po remains the overfed semi-slacker of KFP1. He has a reputation, by time this movie starts, and a bit of an ego to go with it. And, as in common cases of acute sequel-itis, #2 is like #1, but lots more. The difference is that this flick really goes beyond the founding member of the franchise. You'll love to hate the evil peacock, and his foundry evokes Geidi Prime, the Orcs' smithy, or any other industrial hell you can think of. Then there's Peng, Po's father. Gawd, I love that silly little goose. He's all about fatherhood, the kind that comes to define a man's entire identity (except for a noodle or two), a role I admire immensely when I see it in real life. And, of course, the quality of recent animation goes up faster than Moore's Law can explain. Except for one teeny, weeny thing, this adds up to a very enjoyable kids' flick, the kind you might not need a kid to enjoy. (Parents of skittish littler ones, check first to see if your tot is up for the more intense scenes.)That one little thing was the flagrant sequel-bait at the end. Grr. A little foreshadowing can be fun. An ambigiuous ending can engage the viewer's imagination. The ending in this one looks almost like a trailer for the next in series. It's almost as if the movie is doing ""product placement"" advertising for itself.As you watch it, though, try to forget that the ad is coming.

Therefore, I waited a month after I got the movie to even open it and watch it. However, this sequel is beyond awesome, as my granddaughter would say. The plot itself is wonderful, the villain is excellent, and the morality and the wisdom that underlie the plot are needed in the world of children today. I am a big fan of excellent graphics and eastern philosophy. So much rings true in this movie. You care about all of the characters, even the villain. I keep going back to watch it again, simply to be truly entertained. Definitely a keeper for my collection. There is a teaser at the end that seems to predict a third movie. I hope that whoever produced this one will be in charge of it, so that the excellence carries on.",5,better than the first one,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,907,"['Usually', 'assume', 'sequel', 'will', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'set', 'up', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'usually', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'especially', 'animated', 'movies', 'Therefore', 'waited', 'month', 'got', 'movie', 'even', 'open', 'watch', 'However', 'sequel', 'awesome', 'granddaughter', 'would', 'say', 'plot', 'wonderful', 'villain', 'excellent', 'morality', 'wisdom', 'plot', 'are', 'needed', 'world', 'children', 'today', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'excellent', 'graphics', 'eastern', 'philosophy', 'So', 'much', 'rings', 'true', 'movie', 'care', 'characters', 'even', 'villain', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'simply', 'be', 'truly', 'entertained', 'Definitely', 'keeper', 'collection', 'teaser', 'end', 'predict', 'third', 'movie', 'hope', 'whoever', 'produced', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'charge', 'excellence']",N/A

1200504,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001HN690O,Z Hayes,"[40, 48]","My husband, child, and I are fans of the original Kung Fu Panda, but I was rather wary about this sequel since most sequels are never nearly as good as their predecessors. Well, I am glad to be proven wrong by Kung Fu Panda 2! All three of us thought this was not only a worthy successor to the original but actually much better. The key elements that make an animated movie a winner are all here - a stellar cast, impressive animation, well-written script, and a story that appeals to both children and adults.The original cast returns in this sequel with Jack Black providing the voice of Po the adorable Dragon Warrior Panda; Angelina Jolie as Tigress; Jackie Chan as Monkey; Seth Rogen as Mantis; Lucy Liu as Viper; David Cross as Crane; Dustin Hoffman as Shifu the Kung Fu Master; and James Hong as Mr. Ping, Po's dad. In this sequel, viewers are introduced to a new nemesis, Shen, a magnificent peacock skilled in Kung Fu, yet possessed of the blackest of hearts. Shen is ably voiced by Gary Oldman, and every nuance and turn of phrase conveys the evil residing within this creature. One of my favorite Asian actresses, Michelle Yeoh provides the voice of the Soothsayer Ram, an important character in this movie.The story this time centers around Po trying to find his inner peace as instructed by Shifu. Trouble is, Po is haunted by questions about his past, triggered by an encounter with a bandit wolf. Meanwhile, as Po goes through this inner conflict (something which he chooses not to share with his friends), there is serious trouble brewing over in the capital city. Shen, who was once the heir to the Peacock Throne has amassed an army of ferocious wolves, and most importantly, invented a weapon that makes Kung-Fu seem almost obsolete. Shen is enraged when the Soothsayer Ram refuses to back down from her prediction made many years ago - that Shen's fate is intertwined with that of something which is black and white. So the stage is set for a showdown between Po and Shen.The story flows seamlessly, and the animation is of stellar quality. We watched it in 3-D, and I enjoyed the effects, especially the battle scenes (and there are tons of those in this movie). The talented cast makes this a pleasure to watch as each actor brings a unique interpretation to his/her character, and it wasn't about Jack Black voicing a panda, but Po as a real character that comes into his own in this sequel. As in the original, positive messages abound here and these are woven seamlessly into the fabric of the story without seeming to come across as overly didactic. Themes such as the notion of what constitutes a family; loyalty; friendship; ambition/greed/evil; and self-identity are all portrayed in a convincing manner, and best of all, there's lots of humor in here, even when the subject matter is serious. This perfect balance of light and dark, the comical and serious, goes perfectly with the Eastern philosophy of Yin and Yang, and Po is the embodiment of these contrary forces.Kung Fu Panda 2 is rated PG, with a running time of 90 minutes. It is a movie that will appeal to both children and adults, and is entertaining, fun, and poignant.
