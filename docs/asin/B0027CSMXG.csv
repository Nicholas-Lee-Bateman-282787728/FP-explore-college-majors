I would like to by the set for myself in the Blu-ray format but, for some insane reason seasons 2 and 4 aren't on Blu-Ray and I don't know why! This set is worth the buy.

Prison Break is one of those shows. I never saw it on TV and I am quite glad. The suspense and waiting would have driven me nuts. I would have gone insane waiting week to week for the next episode and seasons 1 and 2 end with you wanting to yell at the screen because the season is over. Fortunately, with this set, you can simply pop in the next DVD and keep watching.Michael Schofield is like the modern day MacGuyver. Just when you think he's outsmarted, you realize that he planned for that eventuality and already adjusted for it. This show also makes you want to cheer for the prisoners (most of whom deserve to be in prison). Schofield's brother, Lincoln Burrows is on death row for a murder he did not commit. You can guess that Schofield's goal is to break him out. The plan seems simple enough but naturally, he finds himself in a lot more than he ever expected (hence the series going on for 4 seasons). I won't get into too much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but this is a great show, from start to finish. There are a number of people who say that the show should have ended after season 2, if not season 3 but I did enjoy season 4.",5,Love This Show,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,1287,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'shows', 'out', 'there', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'episode', 'episode', 'Prison', 'Break', 'one', 'shows', 'never', 'saw', 'TV', 'am', 'quite', 'glad', 'suspense', 'waiting', 'would', 'have', 'driven', 'nuts', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'insane', 'waiting', 'week', 'week', 'next', 'episode', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'end', 'wanting', 'yell', 'screen', 'season', 'over', 'Fortunately', 'set', 'can', 'simply', 'pop', 'next', 'DVD', 'keep', 'watching.Michael', 'Schofield', 'modern', 'day', 'MacGuyver', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'outsmarted', 'realize', 'planned', 'eventuality', 'already', 'adjusted', 'show', 'also', 'want', 'cheer', 'prisoners', 'most', 'whom', 'deserve', 'be', 'prison', 'Schofield', 'brother', 'Lincoln', 'Burrows', 'death', 'row', 'murder', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'can', 'guess', 'Schofield', 'goal', 'break', 'out', 'plan', 'simple', 'enough', 'naturally', 'lot', 'more', 'ever', 'expected', 'hence', 'series', 'going', '4', 'seasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'great', 'show', 'start', 'finish', 'are', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'season', '2', 'not', 'season', '3', 'did', 'enjoy', 'season', '4']",Prison Break: Seasons 1-4

I have ordered season sets of other products before, and there has always been a problem with at least one disk. This set was perfect in every way... delivery time, packaging, and quality! If you are a Prison Break fan, this is the set to purchase! I also suggest that you order the corresponding movie.

1253934,A2UF3LJ82II0ZV,B0027CSMXG,E. Murray,"[1, 1]","My husband and I started watching the re-run series of Prison Break on Netflix. My husband, who is much more particular about tv shows and movies, was totally into it from the very beginning. Usually I pick what we watch. But with Prison Break he is asking to watch it. Because it was near his birthday, I purchased through Amazon, the entire series and the movie that came out after that we didn't even know about.The show is exciting, intriging and thoroughly entertaining. Always leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. The charachters have interesting layers to their pasts and you find yourself liking  or at least having sympathy for a charachter, whom you previously despised. The acting is good, the storyline is great. And yes, I like the show too!Currently we are on Season 3.
