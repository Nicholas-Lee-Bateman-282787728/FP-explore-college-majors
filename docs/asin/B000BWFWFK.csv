On several occasions right before Christmas I actually had to stop her from buying seperate seasons without letting her know I was getting this. I couldn't find it anywhere but Amazon. This is a beautiful box set with a TERRIFIC PRICE. Yes it is essentially the original seperate seasons packaged in a pretty outer box, but that is basically all I was looking for.

951890,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000BWFWFK,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[13, 15]","I believe that Joss Whedon is one of the greatest (and definitely the most underrated) writers of our time.  The man is responsible for three of the greatest series of the last decade: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly.  He helped write Toy Story, wrote and directed the wonderful Serenity (a continuation of Firefly), and is a great comic book writer as well.  In his second television series, Angel (which is a spin-off of his critically-acclaimed and cult classic show Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Whedon shows us that he can take a secondary, albeit very interesting, character and develop an entire series around them.  It is very rare for spin-offs to be as highly regarded as their predecessors, with Frasier and Angel being notable exceptions.  Angel pulls it off, though.  Telling a story about redemption, vampires with souls, and life after school, Angel is as entertaining and engaging as its parent series, even if it isn't nearly as known.*SPOILERS TO FOLLOW*PreludeAngel (David Boreanaz)is a 200-year-old vampire who has been cursed with a soul and conscience.  Once known as Angelus, he was one of the worst vampires in history.  He killed people for the fun of it, and not only killed them, he was a master of torture, both physical and mental.  When he killed the daughter of a Gypsy, he paid for his work by getting back his human soul, and he was forced to actually care about the atrocious things that he had done.  After about a century of brooding, self-pity, and remorse, he finally hit rock-bottom and was living on the streets in Manhattan, until a benevolent demon known as Whistler (Max Perlich) showed him Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the newest vampire slayer.  Angel fell for her, and when the two formally met, a paradoxical relationship developed.  But when the vampire and the slayer consumated their love, the unthinkable happened; the curse was broken because Angel experienced true happiness for a moment and forgot about the pain he had caused.  He reverted back to Angelus and wrought havoc throughout Sunnydale, California.  After his soul was returned, he and Buffy tried living in the same city, but it was too hard, and he decided to leave for Los Angeles.Season 1A few months after leaving Sunnydale, Angel has started helping people in Los Angeles, trying to redeem himself for what he did as Angelus.  After meeting up with fellow Sunnydale exile Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpentar) and another benevolent demon called Doyle (Glenn Quinn) who gets prophetic visions from the ""Powers That Be"", the trio decide to set up Angel Investigations, a paranormal detective agency.  They help people deal with problems such as demonic possessions, vampire attacks, and ghost hauntings.  Working with Kate Lockley (Elisabeth Rohm), a contact at the LAPD, Angel and company try to ""help the helpless"".  Unfortunately, Wolfram and Hart, a conduit to pure evil posing as a lawfirm, tends to cause problems for Angel.  The company is an outlet for evil, and it uses a lawfirm facade to legitimate its actions, as well as helping demons, warlocks, and other kinds of villains get out of legal trouble.  About halfway through the season, Cordelia starts receiving the visions, which start her on a path that changes her from the selfish valley girl of Buffy to a full-fleged hero, and ex-Watcher Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) joins the team.  The season studies adult issues, such as getting your first job, getting your first apartment, and being a start-up business trying to take on a large corporation.  While it is more episodic than most of the other seasons, it still is entertaining, and the final episode leaves us with a great cliffhanger.Season 2After learning about the Shanshu prophecy, which states that ""the vampire with a soul"" will become human again after he has redeemed himself, Angel kind of goes into overdrive trying to save as many people as he can.  He also hires Charles Gunn (J. August Richards), a street kid who fights vampires, to help out at Angel Investigations.  Meanwhile, Wolfram and Hart has resurrected Darla (Julie Benz), the vampire that sired Angel, and they plan on using her to lure Angel back to the side of evil.  Eventually, Angel begins to question if the ""little"" things he is doing are enough to redeem him, and he has a meltdown.  He decides that its time to fight a war, and begins a series of massive attacks against W&H;, one of which leaves a large percentage of the senior staff dead.  In a sense, he become Angelus, but he still has a soul.  It isn't until the near-death of a friend that he realizes the true value of the little things.  The season ends with the group traveling to a world called Pylea, which is the home dimension of Lorne the Host (Andy Hallet), a demon who had been helping the team out throughout the year.  While there, they meet Winifred ""Fred"" Burkle (Amy Acker), an LA woman who was sucked into Pylea 5 years prior, and has nearly gone insane living in the world where humans are nothing but beasts of burden.Season 3Upon returning from Pylea, the gang found Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), one of their friends from Sunnydale, who tells them that Buffy is dead.  Distraught, Angel spent 3 months in a temple meditating on the issue.  Upon his return to LA, he soon learns that Darla is pregnant, which should be an impossibility.  Vampires are infertile, and yet he and Darla have set in motion the events of a prophecy stating that two vampires will give birth to a child.  This causes all sorts of problems for the group; Wolfram and Hart wants the child to experiment on while vampire cults think that it is some sort of deity.  Possibly worst of all, Daniel Holtz (Keith Szarabajka), a vampire hunter from 1700's England who had run-ins with Angel and Darla, has been transported to the present by Sajhaan (Jack Conley), a time-traveling demon, in order to get revenge on the pair for what they did to his family in the 18th century. Employing a group of people who have also been hurt by vampires, Holtz intends to take Connor, Angel's son.  Eventually, things get to a point where W&H;, Sajhaan, Holtz, and Angel are all battling for Connor, and Holtz takes the baby to a demon dimension, never to be seen again.  Due to Wes' indirect role in the kidnapping, Angel tries to kill him, and he is ostrasized from the group.  But a few weeks later, a now teenaged Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) due to the fact that time moves differently in the other dimension, breaks back through the barrier back to LA and tries to kill Angel.  Holtz raised him to believe that Angel was a monster (which isn't completely false), and it leads to a great cliffhanger ending.Season 4The previous season ended with the group in shambles.  Lorne left for Las Vegas, Wesley was cut out from the group, Cordelia ascended to a higher plane of existence, and Angel was sealed in a box and dropped to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.  Meanwhile, Fred and Gunn (who have no idea what happened to Angel or Cordy) look after Connor (who is responsible for Angel, but has no knowledge of where Cordy is) and teach him how to be a good demon fighter.  Meanwhile, Wesley kidnapped Justine Holt (Laurel Holloman), Holtz's right-hand woman and lover, and is using her to find Angel.  When Angel gets back to the surface, he kicks Connor out and rejoins Fred and Gunn.  After finding out where Cordelia is, they go to Vegas to get Lorne back.  Upon their return to LA, they find Cordelia back in their hotel, but with no knowledge of who she is or who they are.  Soon, Cordy's memories are returned, Wes rejoins the group, and a monstrous Beast rises up from the ground and nearly kills every member of the group.  It effectively takes out Wolfram and Hart, and successfully blocks out the sun.  To make matters worse, the gang gets information that says that the Beast and Angelus have some sort of connection, and in order to find a way to defeat the Beast, they remove Angel's soul.  Angelus causes many more problems than he sovles, and he is soon on the loose after the Beast's mysterious master releases him.  Eventually, the goddess Jasmine, who had been pulling all the strings, is born from Cordelia and tries to take over the world... by uniting people under world peace.  By the end of the year, the gang receives a monumental offer from a former enemy.Season 5As a reward for ending world peace, Angel and his team are offered complete control of the LA branch of Wolfram and Hart to run any way they see fit.  They accept in order to use its infinite resources to do good.  Things seem overwhelming, but when Spike (James Marsters), another vampire who has been granted a soul, is resurrected after saving the world in the Buffy series finale, things get much more complicated.  Angel and Spike can't stand each other, and for a while, Spike is merely a ghost who can't leave W&H;, and thus annoys Angel in order to pass the time.  But after becoming corporeal again, the two vampires fight over the rights to the Shanshu prophecy, only to have Spike beat Angel in a fight for the first time ever.  Fortunately for Angel, the two were set up.  Unfortunately for everyone, the man behind the events is one of Angel's old rivals.  As the season goes on, the gang find themselves making comprimises left and right, one of which leads to the death of Fred and the rising of Illyria, an ancient demon who uses Fred's body as a vessel on the Earth.  Eventually, the gang learns that tehy have been taken in by W&H;, and since they are now only reacting to situations, they are no longer the heroes they once were.  This season is also fairly episodic, but the fact that there doesn't seem to be an arc turns out to be the arc (only Joss could pull that off).  Furthermore, the relationship dynamic between Angel and Spike helps elevate this season to one of the series' best.Angel is one of the best series you've never seen.  It dealt with very real issues through wonderful metaphors.  I love how this show, along with Buffy, was more ""real"" than most other shows, many of which did not involve demons, magic, and monsters.  While it got 5 seasons, it still had a lot of stories to tell, and was cut short.  The WB made a big mistake cancelling it (especially considering everything that the show had going for it in its final year), but at least we got 5 great years.  If you have never seen Angel, now is the time to redeem yourself and catch up with all five seasons.",5,Arch Angel,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,10488,"['believe', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'one', 'greatest',

951891,A2QA9K9Z0XRR0D,B000BWFWFK,Andy. Gillum,"[2, 2]","Season One was terrific.  Angel's darkness & Cordy's energy worked great together &, while I didn't hate Doyle, Wesly added more to the series.  Wolfram & Hart was a terrific idea & the stories were great.  Season Two had some great plot twists with Darla`s rebirth that kept you wondering where it was going.  I was also interesting to see Angel turn dark but not evil & the new cast fit perfectly.  Season Three had all the ingredients that would've made Angel rival BTVS's greatness.  Darla's pregnacy was an exciting & unexpected storyline.  Angel having a child added more demensions to the show, the deepening relationship between him & Cordy was terrific & Holtz was a great villian.  So much potential was there for great future seasons.... until Connor grew up supernaturally fast & Cordy was sent down a path that wouldn`t payoff, ruining everything.Season Four was the worst of a Joss Whedon show.  The Beast was a cool baddie, seeing Angelius & Faith return to face off as well as some great stories were spectacular.  Unfortunately, their ultimate plan for Connor was a total letdown with it`s convoluted setup that tainted everything Cordy had been through, ruining the season.  Season Five was a breath of fresh air after the disappointing previous season.  Having Angel & Company run Wolfram & Hart was genius and kept things tense.

When the show was cancelled, WB had made a little ""Thank You"" video speech, thanking them for the 5 seasons of Angel. But There were fans who had petitions too save the show, and the ratings were good too continue.But I heard it was like my overall favorite series, ""The Incredible Hulk,"" In that despite the high ratings, the show(s) were too expensive too produce.But having followed the final season of the series into the world of graphic novels and comicbooks. Everyone from Wesley too Fred came back from the afterlife. I would of loved too of seen a continuation of their relationship, even though Fred had been turned into a demon, and was begining too understand her feelings for Wesley. Plus she was kicking Angels butt, lol.I always thought with the success of ""The Avengers"" that maybe WB would be willing too resurrect the characters into a series of reunion movies, and tie up many of the loose ends. And what has happened too the characters. Did Angel finally become human in the end and marry Buffy? When he signed his soul away too Wolfram and Hart, was it his real name he was signing, Angel or Angeleus, ect? Things we will probly never know.

What's up with that???? This is total biase! I'm already really really pissed that Buffy is more popular than Angel, which in my opinion, should be the other way around, Angel is a much much much better show than Buffy in consistency, storyline, mature ideas, and memoriable characters.David Boreanaz mastered his role as Angel to ABSOLUTE perfection, he became my number one favorite actor (surprisingly too may I add) after I got addicted to Angel. Of course this is also thanks to the brlliant cast and crew and of course, the most talented writers of all time. And oh, for those of you who hasn't seen Angel or hasn't seen it all the way and judge David's performance from Buffy, I suggest you give it a second chance, he is just surprisingly good on his own show because he had much more room to expand his talent, while on Buffy he doesn't so much as showing his face, I was glad I saw Angel before Buffy, definitely NO biase from me, he is just utterly brilliant, period.All the other characters on Angel I just liked so much better than the characters on Buffy, they are just each unique and never dull to watch. I've seen Angel the series for at least 9 times, never get sick of it.Angel proved that the whole fantasy/Sci-fi stuff is not only teen-shows, however the channel WB has affect on people's impressions. It proved that not all fantasy-sci-fi stuff are bunch of cliches, in which on Angel you will not find ANY.If you think this is a show about monsters, you are wrongIf you think this is a show about redemption, you are wrongIf you think this is a show about good verus evil in which good will triumph in the end, you are wrongThis is a show that has all of the above and then some, but the ""some"" parts are the ones that will not go in the direction you thought it will, I guarantee you that you will be suprised.This is a show that will really make you laugh and really make you cry, it will carve into your flesh and bone, and make you NEVER forget it, it will make you angry, make you feel comfort, make you feel depressed, make you feel joy, and make you want more.

951898,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000BWFWFK,calvinnme,"[241, 268]","Angel ran an all too short five seasons from 1999-2004, and the now defunct WB network may be defunct in part because of its decision to cancel the show. The story starts out where Buffy The Vampire Slayer season 3 left off, with Angel leaving Sunnydale and his beloved Buffy so that she can have a semblance of a normal life, or at least a normal relationship, which the two of them could never have. The entire series can be divided into three parts, all of which take place in L.A., Angel's new home. I'll warn you right now, there are SPOILERS AHEAD.The first part consists of season one, and is in monster-of-the-week format rather than the season-long story arcs that Joss Whedon was famous for in Buffy. In season one, Angel starts a supernatural detective agency, ""Angel Investigations"", with the help of Cordelia Chase, who has moved to L.A. after her family lost all of their money the previous year, and half human-half demon Doyle. Doyle dies a courageous death half-way through the season, and Wesley Windham-Pryce joins the cast as a ""rogue demon hunter"" who has been fired from the watcher's council for the Faith debacle in Sunnydale the previous year. In this first season he is the same awkward Wesley we saw in season three of BTVS, but that eventually changes. At the end of the season we are introduced to Charles Gunn, a streetwise kid who has been fighting demons his whole life and ekeing out a meager existence on the street. Slowly, he comes to trust Angel and eventually joins the group.The second part of the series consists of seasons two through four, and is literally one long story arc. Season two deals with the resurrection of Angel's vampire lover Darla, the one who turned him into a vampire in 1753, and whom he killed in season one of BTVS. The ordeal of getting Darla back as a human, and then losing her again when she becomes a vampire once more, drives Angel to the dark side of his soul. He turns against his friends for a brief time as he goes on a crusade of punishing the guilty - Wolfram & Hart - rather than helping the helpless. Eventually he has an epiphany, and returns to his friends and his senses - but not before he and Darla have a night of passion that results in season three's story arc - Darla's pregnancy and the ""birth"" of Angel's son Conner. Also, at the end of season two the Fang Gang rescues a girl (""Fred"") from an alternate dimension - Pylea - which also happens to be the home dimension of Lorne, an empath demon that has been helping Angel and his friends.In season 3, Angel is adjusting to fatherhood when an old enemy from his vampire past is mystically conjured up - Holtz, a man whose entire family was killed by Angel and Darla when they were both vampires. Holtz uses Wesley's fear of a prophecy that ""The father shall kill the son"" to get him to steal Angel's son, whom Holtz in turn steals from Wesley. Holtz is cornered by multiple parties who also want Conner, and Holtz takes the infant and jumps into a portal to a hell dimension rather than give up the child. Later in season three, Conner and Holtz both return from the hell dimension. With time running differently in the two dimensions, Conner is now 18 years old, and none too fond of Angel, since Holtz' tales of Angel's cruelty as a vampire have doubtless been Conner's bedtime stories for his entire life. Holtz conjures up a plan to commit assisted suicide and make it look like he has been murdered by Angel so that Conner will take revenge on him. The plan works, and Conner sinks Angel to the bottom of the Pacific in a box, to suffer an everlasting torment of slow starvation.Season four is the most misunderstood and the wildest ride of any of the seasons. In the first episode, Wesley tries to redeem himself by retrieving Angel from the bottom of the ocean after capturing Conner's accomplice in Angel's imprisonment. Cordelia was made a ""higher power"" at the end of season three, and she suddenly turns up at Angel's doorstep several episodes into season four, unable to remember anything. The rest of the season is a dizzying blur that involves a mysterious Beast that blots out the sun, the temporary unsouling of Angel so that the gang can question Angelus about his memories of the Beast, another mystical pregnancy that culminates in an evil higher power - Jasmine - coming into the world, and that evil power bringing ""world peace"" in return for the world's unquestioning worship - until Angel allows people to see Jasmine's true appearance and they run from her in horror. The season concludes with Angel and his crew being given control of the L.A. branch of evil mystical law firm Wolfram & Hart supposedly as a reward for ""destroying world peace"". Angel agrees to the deal, if in return all memories of Conner's existence are erased from everyone who knew him and if Conner is placed in a ""normal"" family with new planted memories that involve only his new family, and not his actual past. This acts as a reset for all of the emotional pain of the past three years for everyone except Angel, who retains his memories of what actually happened.Season five basically stands alone and is the third and final part of the series. This final season returns more to the monster-of-the-week format that was present in season one, largely as a condition of WB renewing the show since the confusing labrynth that was season four had not had stellar ratings. Spike, from the now defunct BTVS, is thrown into the mix, at first as a ghost that is unable to leave the premises of Wolfram & Hart. Later in the season Spike reclaims his corporeal presence, though. The first part of the season is on the light side, as each member of the Fang Gang receives their dream job on a platter at Wolfram & Hart, with all of the resources they could ever ask, and the hope of doing good deeds in a place once renowned for evil. Later though, they slowly discover that is they that are being changed and compromised, not the law firm. This culminates in one great tragedy two-thirds into the season, resulting in the death of one the members of the Fang Gang. In the end, Angel and his crew decide to turn the tables and strike at the heart of the players in the Apocalypse by killing all of the members of an evil secret society. They are successful, but there are casualties among their ranks. The last scene shows the survivors cornered in an alley about to be attacked by Wolfram & Hart's minions. When asked what they should do, the last line of the show is Angel telling the others ""Well, Personally? I Kinda Wanna Slay the Dragon."" as he swings a sword and we fade to black. The Fang Gang goes out fighting and we never really know what happened to them, and because the actors have long since gone on to other projects, we never will.""Angel"" is adult fare from start to finish, not the teen fare of at least the early years of Buffy. However, Joss Whedon's epic tale of a vampire with a soul and his search for redemption is great television. Angel is not the only character on a journey in this series. Throughout the tenure of the show we watch the shallow and selfish Cordelia Chase change into a brave soul who is willing to become part demon in order to continue on in her mission. We also watch as Wesley changes from buffoonish comic relief into a true rogue demon hunter who has a penchant for darkness that rivals Angel. Charles Gunn changes from the street-wise kid who is proud of being the muscle into someone who is willing to sell his soul to not to return to that role. Even Lorne is not spared, as he changes from the consummate entertainer with an ever-sunny personality into someone who can only find solace at the bottom of a glass of alcohol and loses his heart for the good fight ""the moment I found out a girl I loved was going to die"".As far as the specific contents of this package go, you'll be getting all of the 110 original episodes with all of the extra features included in the original DVD sets. In addition, there is supposed to be a companion booklet and a special letter to fans from Joss Whedon.",5,So much more than a sequel to Buffy,1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,8072,"['Angel', 'ran',

It's very space efficient for five seasons. None of the DVDs have ever skipped or given me any problems.Spoilers ahead.With respect to Angel the series... what great stuff. It was a bit slow in season 1, but by the start of season 2 I ""needed"" to watch the series, to see what would happen to the characters. The Angel-Darla romance is imo the most beautiful romantic story arc in the Buffyverse. It was fascinating to see how she changed as she went from human to vampire back to human and to vampire again, and then finally a vampire gestating a hybrid baby who has a soul. Also great: Angel going dark in season 2 without actually being Angelus; the GUNN character and the exploration of human society's underworld, and how they know more about vampires; the alternate reality kingdom that Lorne is from; and finally the gang taking over Wolfram and Hart in season 5.I'm not sure how this series compares to Buffy.

And I fell in love with one of the best shows ever made for TV. The angle of Redemption, the vampire with a soul that struggles with his own personal (and literally real) demon to overcome his past transgressions and to become a better ""person"" (in the lack of a better word!) is a metaphor of the human condition in all times. The famous gypsy curse that unsouls Angel if he experiences one single moment of perfect happiness is the most cunning artifice that an experienced scriptwriter could invent to compose a character full of angst,guilt and perplexity. Angel does not make his own choices, he deals with the cards that Fate or The Powers that Be give to him. Buffy is young, human, has a whole life to live besides being the Slayer and she can find happiness and still save the world in daily basis. Angel is cursed in knowing that whatever he does from now on will NEVER erase his past, his crimes are almost without forgiveness. So he saves people out of desperation, feeling that even the best that he does is not good enough because he is still a VAMPIRE, a predator, a beast that must remain contained to not kill or maim another human. The complexity of the character, the other actors that suffered also transformations walking through paths almost from Hell makes Angel one of the most unforgettable TV shows of all times. You never becomes tired of watching Angel. The human condition with all its flaws is the plot of the TV show and the Vampire with a Soul/Champion of the Helpless is the mirror that every person that seeks redemption from past mistakes must contemplate. If you never watched this show, please do. If you have watched and forgotten, please watch again. You will find nuances and subplots that will astonish you.

951917,A1QSZ53SD7QIRD,B000BWFWFK,"empressT ""Luv2Read""","[4, 4]","The naysayers and detractors will say that 'Angel' was simply riding on the coattails of the popular (and critically acclaimed) BtVS. Like its predecessors 'Melrose Place' (spin-off of 'Beverly Hills 90210') and even further back, 'The Jeffersons' (spun-off of 'All in the Family'), the brilliant Joss Whedon managed to craft a more mature product right from the get-go when 'Angel' premiered on the WB in the Fall of 1999. This was grittier, rawer and edgier than BtVS showed in its infancy. From its inception, 'Angel' explored the dark forces of the main characters' psyches and pushed the envelope with the ""monster-of-the-week"" format.The show wasn't without its hitches. I can remember DESPISING Elisabeth Rohm's character of Det. Kate Lockley from the very beginning (she comes from the Jennifer Aniston school of acting-1 note emoting, and its flat). The late Glenn Quinn's character of Francis Doyle-while somewhat charming-didn't mesh quite right with David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter. The season 4 storyline of Angel's teenage son Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) and Cordelia was ICKY beyond belief (so upset Joss took it there), and their hell-spawn Jasmine was a waste of time (and Geena Torres' talent).Luckily the hits were much greater. Boreanaz cements his status as one of TV's greatest vampires ever, while Charisma Carpenter's Cordelia Chase was so much more developed and layered than her short 3 seasons on BtVS. Loved, loved, loved (!) Alexis Denisof as Wesley Wyndham-Price, J.

Joining him is Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), one of Buffy's classmates who has moved to L.A, along with half-demon Doyle (Glenn Quinn). Over the course of the series, Angel and Cordelia are joined by a cast of great characters, including Buffy and Faith's ex-watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof), vampire hunter Gunn (J. August Richards), the cute and brainy Fred Burkle (Amy Acker), and kareoke singing demon Lorne (Andy Hallet).

About 2-years ago I got a really good deal on this collectors set and it promptly sat on my shelf for nearly 2-years.  As a result of the good ratings, the track record of Joss Whedon and the recent hiatus in the schedule, I broke the seal on the set and started watching.  Season 1 started somewhat slowly (as is the MO for Joss Whedon series), though seasons 2-4 caused several nights of limited sleep, as almost every show ended with a cliff hanger and I told myself that I would simply watch 5-minutes of the next episode and the next thing I knew is was 4:30 AM!  Season 5 simply felt different where perhaps it was the removal of the cliff hanger concept.  Perhaps it was the disappearance of Charisma Carpenter from the show, as aside from cut off tight shirts, she seemed to have some of the better lines and her delivery was so non chalant that some of the verbal entendres were easy to miss.

I have viewed this entire series three times and have never gotten tired of it.  The cast really clicks and they really did take some  of the great characters from Buffy like Charisma Carpenter, &#34;Wesley Wyndom Price&#34; (Alexis Denisof), and of course James Marsters.  The rest of the cast is also a complete fit with the Buffy alums.  The chemistry between the characters is great.  I even liked the original casting of Glen Quinn and it was so sad that he died.  I did notice that they did a dedication to him at the end of on of the shows.It was in seeing the interviews with David Boreanaz that I realized that he is absolutely hillarious.  I had no idea.  This is an actor that can laugh at himself and have fun with it.

A spin-off series made after the first 3 years of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel is a series that rivaled (even bettered!) it's parent show! The writing was top notch, the acting was amazing, the special effects are stunning, and the storylines were shocking. Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt really created a brilliant series which blended dark storytelling, classic humor, fantastic fights and original characters flawlessly. From it's refreshing first season to the sinister events of it's fifth and final season, Angel was an inventive yet short lived series that put a new spin on redemption with gripping storylines. Each season had strong themes and episodes that always tested the core cast that made up Team Angel: Angel, Cordelia, Wesley, Gunn, and Fred with Lorne as their lovable ally. All 5 glorious seasons can be summed up like this:Season 1 (1999-2000)-Angel, a vampire with a soul, arrives in L.A. ready to start his road to redemption but finding a hard time to control his thirst for blood. Doyle, a mysterious half-demon Irish bad boy, comes to Angel and reveals he is a messenger for the Powers That Be. With his visions, Doyle guides Angel to the innocents of L.A. he must protect. One of them being Cordelia, the smart mouthed ex-rich girl from Sunnydale, who joins Angel and Doyle on the mission to save the lost souls of L.A. by creating a detective agency, Angel Investigations. But the trio better beware, Law firm Wolfarm and Hart is an enemy that will continue to do battle with them.

But Angel better beware Wolfarm and Hart as they won't make his mission easy, as they bring back a pivotal woman from his past, Darla. Darla's appearence brings back horrifying memories from Angel's dark past and to make matters worse, Drusilla returns to make Darla what she once was. The fearsome duo reck havok on the streets of L.A. which forces Angel to take a dark persona and set on a new mission that drives his 3 good friends away.

Angel seems better than Buffy because some of the people that are involved seem more real- more human than the Buffy series.

So I found it on YouTube and you know something- I didn't know that Glen who played Doyle died in real life- I didn't know he died from an heroin overdose.  It's sad because his character, Doyle- he seemed like an average regular joe and I just loved him because of the way he'd look at Cordelia and she never caught on to him being that infatuated with her almost until it was too late, when he kissed her.  I find it so kind of him to give her that gift, his gift- the visions, he found her worthy to have it and to him it meant something.  I guess that means Doyle did love Cordelia very much- the courage and strength he had to end his life for others, including his love.  That's very romantic and very sad.

951948,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B000BWFWFK,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[2, 2]","ANGEL was that rarest of shows, a spin-off on equal footing with its parent, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. In the first season of BUFFY, Angel was introduced to us as a notoriously sadistic vampire (Angelus) who fell afoul of a gypsy clan in 1898 and was cursed with  restoration of his human soul. Still a vampire, but now tormented by his human conscience, Angel (David Boreanaz) wandered aimlessly for 100 years before he met and fell in love with Buffy, and decided it was possible for him to achieve redemption by fighting the forces of evil. Three years later, he got his own show.ANGEL was markedly different in tone than BUFFY - like the main character, ably played by David Boreanaz, the show was dark and brooding, and got a great deal of mileage out of tormenting its protagonist and his sidekicks both mentally, physically and emotionally. A champion for the forces of good, Angel is not only brutal in his methods but overflowing with doubts about whether personal redemption is possible or the war against evil anything but a fool's errand. His friendships with with BUFFY alums Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) and Wesley Wyndham-Price (Alexis Denisoff), Francis Doyle (the late great Glenn Quinn), Charles Gunn (J. August Richards), Fred (Amy Acker) and Lorne (Andy Hallett) provide him with some stability, but Angel is nearly as hard on those he loves as those he hates, and those looking for stainless heroes who never lose should look elsewhere.Series Overview:Season 1: This is a very good inaugural effort, showing Angel's arrival in L.A. and his formation of Angel Investigations with Doyle and Cordelia (and later, Wesley and Gunn). It explores much of Angel's 18th century backstory and has guest appearances by numerous BUFFY cast members. It also introduces the principal villain of the series, the demonic law firm of Wolfram & Hart. The season is undermined somewhat by the unfortunate departure of the excellent Doyle character and by some problems establishing its own identity, but it's still good. *** Season 2: An excellent effort which centers around W & H's attempt to drive Angel to the dark side by resurrecting his vampiric sire and lover of 150 years, Darla (another BUFFY alum). As Angel grows darker and darker, his friends are forced to continue the fight against evil without him, and tension rises as collateral damage piles up everywhere. This season introduces two new characters, Lorne, an empathic demon who reads peoples futures by hearing them sing (hilarious) and Fred, a nerdily charming genius who becomes grist for a future love triangle between Wes and Gunn. We also get to see goddess-hot Charisma Carpeter in a metal bikini. **** Season 3: One of the more brutal seasons. Angel's dalliance with Darla produces a resentful supernatural offspring named Connor (Vincent Kartheiser), whose arrival gives an old enemy, Holtz, an opportunity to pay Angel back in kind for slaughtering his family in the 1700s. Conned into betraying Angel, Wesley is ostracized by the gang and wavers between good and evil. To top it all off, Cordelia and Angel begin to explore their feelings for each other, only to be forced apart by two very separate sets of circumstances. ****Season 4: This was at once the best and theworst of ANGEL. The first three-quarters of the shows were superb and featured a seemingly indestructable foe and ever-increasing tension as the screws were turned on each character: Cordelia returns from the netherworld with no memory and a hidden agenda; the relationship between Gunn and Fred crumbles; Connor descends into madness; Wesley flirts more and more with villainy; Angelus returns to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, the season falls apart almost completely when Charisma Carpenter's character is written out of the show and the ultimate villain finally introduced. *** 1/2Season 5: A work of genius from beginning to end, my only beef with it is that it's so good it leaves you starving for the more that was supposed to come: in a shocking move, Angel & Company are invited to take over Wolfram & Hart, where they hope to ""change the system from the inside"" and pay a corresponding price as the seduction of power overtakes them. J. August Richards does his best work when his character is given an ""upgrade"" he can't bear to relinquish, and Amy Acker and Alexis Denisoff should have gotten Emmys for their heartrending performance as doomed lovers. Finally, the addition of BUFFY alum Spike (James Marsters) to the cast was a masterstroke that does the impossible, actually compensating for the loss of Charisma Carpenter. But even she gets a touching goodbye in ""You're Welcome"", an outstanding episode in an outstanding season.*****That's ANGEL.

951951,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000BWFWFK,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","I stumbled on to Buffy and Angel rather late.  I started watching the shows in what was the 5th Season for Buffy and the 2nd season of Angel.  Obviously I have seen every episode since both shows were put out on DVD, but I remember becoming an instant fan of both shows, especially Angel, even without all the back-story.  The overall theme of Angel was always the fight against evil, and how it never ends.  The themes on Angel tended to be more mature than those on Buffy, especially as compared to the first three seasons of Buffy.  It did really well in fleshing out his back-story and the transition from Angelus to the good guy he would ultimately become.The thing I loved that they were able to do on Angel, that was the whole storyline about the redemption of Faith that started in season 1 and carried over to season 4.  The whole story was well written, well acted, and was probably not something that could have ever been done effectively on Buffy.  The show also did well at making all the characters evolve, especially Cordelia and Wesley.  At least not as effectively as it was on Angel.  The last season seems to be one that many fans either liked or hated.  I loved the last season.  The whole story of trying to fight evil from inside the belly of the beast was done well.  And it had some of the best episodes of the series, including Hellbound, Smile Time, A Hole in The World, and Shells.The ending to the series was rushed, mainly because the network cancelled the show pretty much at the last minute.  They actually had to go back and re-shoot some of the scenes for the last show after they knew it was going to be a series finale rather than the season finale. While not quite a Sapranos fade abrupt black screen, the series is not wrapped up in a nice tidy bow.  It cuts off at the start of an epic battle, the conclusion to which we never know (unless you get the season 6 comic books).Chances are if you are reading this you already know at least a little bit about the series.  While liking or disliking a TV show involves a large amount of subjectivity, what I can tell you is that if you have seen some of the shows and liked those, the series on the whole is consistently good with not many bad or ""clunker"" episodes among the 110 episodes.",5,One of my favorite series,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,2271,"['stumbled', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'rather', 'late', 'started', 'watching', 'shows', 'was', '5th', 'Season', 'Buffy', '2nd', 'season', 'Angel', 'Obviously', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', 'shows', 'were', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'remember', 'becoming', 'instant', 'fan', 'shows', 'especially', 'Angel', 'even', 'back-story', 'overall', 'theme', 'Angel', 'was', 'always', 'fight', 'evil', 'how', 'never', 'themes', 'Angel', 'tended', 'be', 'more', 'mature', 'Buffy', 'especially', 'compared', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'did', 'really', 'well', 'fleshing', 'out', 'back-story', 'transition', 'Angelus', 'good', 'guy', 'would', 'ultimately', 'become.The', 'thing', 'loved', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'Angel', 'was', 'whole', 'storyline', 'redemption', 'Faith', 'started', 'season', '1', 'carried', 'season', '4', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'done', 'effectively', 'Buffy', 'show', 'also', 'did', 'well', 'making', 'characters', 'evolve', 'especially', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'effectively', 'was', 'Angel', 'last', 'season', 'be', 'one', 'many', 'fans', 'liked', 'hated', 'loved', 'last', 'season', 'whole', 'story', 'trying', 'fight', 'evil', 'belly', 'beast', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'had', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'including', 'Hellbound', 'Smile', 'Time', 'A', 'Hole', 'World', 'Shells.The', 'ending', 'series', 'was', 'rushed', 'mainly', 'network', 'cancelled', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'last', 'minute', 'actually', 'had', 'go', 'back', 're-shoot', 'scenes', 'last', 'show', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'series', 'finale', 'rather', 'season', 'finale', 'not', 'Sapranos', 'fade', 'abrupt', 'black', 'screen', 'series', 'not', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nice', 'tidy', 'bow', 'off', 'start', 'epic', 'battle', 'conclusion', 'never', 'know', 'get', 'season', '6', 'comic', 'books', '.Chances', 'are', 'are', 'reading', 'already', 'know', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'series', 'liking', 'disliking', 'TV', 'show', 'large', 'amount', 'subjectivity', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'have', 'seen', 'shows', 'liked', 'series', 'whole', 'consistently', 'good', 'not', 'many', 'bad', 'clunker', 'episodes', '110', 'episodes']",Angel - Seasons 1-5

I thought Julie Benz (who plays Darla) was one of the cutest girls I'd ever seen. It was by pure coincidence that I remembered that episode when I saw this set on the Gold Box deal on Amazon.

A little curious about that since Joss Whedon said he didn't want to show ""Buffy"" in letterbox for artistic reasons. But I'm glad ""Angel"" was released in widescreen. If they do the same for ""Buffy"", I understand the UK version is.

I didn't watch Buffy either, but I had always wanted to watch both based on the reviews and word of mouth.  I saw just enough to tantalize but I always was reticent about diving into something half way through.So earlier this year I bought the entire Buffy series on DVD and watched it in about two months, from start to finish.  It went beyond my expectations with the great writing, intriguing stories, and interesting characters.  So after finishing it I ended up getting Angel, to see where his story led to after he left Sunnydale.Though both series were different I appreciated how they tied together for the four years they were on at the same time.Buffy always had a more specific path to follow whereas Angel is much more meandering, with no real ""Big Bad"" that haunts him throughout an entire season.  We get to see Angel and the supporting cast all shift, change, transform, and mature in so many different ways throughout the series, making it easy for me to attach to them and enjoy them both at their best and worst.People have told me that Angel was darker than Buffy.  For me, it was more that he did not have a specific path to follow.  ""We help the helpless"" was the mantra for a long time but even with that it gets a little hazy in Angel's world as to what is supposed to happen.  For Buffy, it was always clearer.  At least the big picture.Both series have so much to offer for fans that it would be hard for me to say which I liked better.  Most of the folks who would think to pick up either series on DVD probably already have their minds made up and were previous fans.  So I consider myself lucky that I was able to cough up the dough for both series and was able to watch them both, for the first time, episode to episode, back to back.",5,Great show,1227312000,"11 22, 2008",2008,1818,"['never', 'watched', 'much', 'Angel', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Buffy', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'watch', 'based', 'reviews', 'word', 'mouth', 'saw', 'just', 'enough', 'tantalize', 'always', 'was', 'reticent', 'diving', 'something', 'half', 'way', 'through.So', 'earlier', 'year', 'bought', 'entire', 'Buffy', 'series', 'DVD', 'watched', 'about', 'two', 'months', 'start', 'finish', 'went', 'expectations', 'great', 'writing', 'intriguing', 'stories', 'interesting', 'characters', 'So', 'finishing', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'Angel', 'see', 'where', 'story', 'led', 'left', 'Sunnydale.Though', 'series', 'were', 'different', 'appreciated', 'how', 'tied', 'together', 'four', 'years', 'were', 'same', 'time.Buffy', 'always', 'had', 'more', 'specific', 'path', 'follow', 'whereas', 'Angel', 'much', 'more', 'meandering', 'real', 'Big', 'Bad', 'entire', 'season', 'get', 'see', 'Angel', 'supporting', 'cast', 'shift', 'change', 'transform', 'mature', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'series', 'making', 'easy', 'attach', 'enjoy', 'best', 'worst.People', 'have', 'told', 'Angel', 'was', 'darker', 'Buffy', 'was', 'more', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'specific', 'path', 'follow', 'help', 'helpless', 'was', 'mantra', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'little', 'hazy', 'Angel', 'world', 'what', 'supposed', 'happen', 'Buffy', 'was', 'always', 'clearer', 'least', 'big', 'picture.Both', 'series', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'offer', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'say', 'liked', 'better', 'Most', 'folks', 'who', 'would', 'think', 'pick', 'up', 'series', 'DVD', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'minds', 'made', 'up', 'were', 'previous', 'fans', 'So', 'consider', 'lucky', 'was', 'able', 'cough', 'up', 'dough', 'series', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'episode', 'episode', 'back', 'back']",Angel - Seasons 1-5

951965,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000BWFWFK,Robert Moore,"[204, 253]","Warning!  Contains major spoilers!I recently watched a great documentary about the women stunt double's Jeannie Epper and Zo Bell.  The latter was Lucy Lawless's stunt double on XENA, though she is now perhaps best known for her work as Uma Thurman's double in KILL BILL and her amazing work playing herself in DEATH PROOF (she was the New Zealand chick on the hood of the Dodge Challenger).  The extras included an interview with Quentin Tarantino and one of the things they asked him was his thoughts on XENA, the show on which Bell first performed (as Lucy Lawless points out, two women portrayed Xena, but only one really got credit).  His analysis of XENA was, I think, really profound.  The central idea was that Xena was someone who had committed crimes so extensive and so extreme that even though she had turned to the path of doing good, she was never going to be able to balance things.  No matter how many good things she did, the bad would still overshadow them.  As he puts it, not matter what she does ""she'll only be paying ten cents on the dollar.""  The second I heard this from Tarantino, I realized that he was describing not only Xena but also Angel.  If anything, Angel's crimes were worse than Xena's because he not only killed his victims, but also robbed them of their souls.  Rarely has television seen such an extended examination of the possibilities of personal salvation.XENA and ANGEL had one other thing in common.  Both were among the most successful spin offs in TV history.  Though XENA never garnered the critical acclaim that either BUFFY or ANGEL achieved, it far surpassed HERCULES in both popularity and critical acclaim.  ANGEL never eclipsed BUFFY as XENA did HERCULES, but it nonetheless became one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV.  Its cancellation following its fifth season, when it was one of the highest rated shows on the WB, remains one of the most mystifying of the past decade.  The fan campaign to save the show far surpassed the successful campaign to save JERICHO this year.  And although Joss Whedon has recently announced that he intends to produce ANGEL Season 6 in comic form, just as he is currently undertaking BUFFY Season 8 on Darkhorse Comics, ANGEL continues to be missed by its fans.One of the many things that made ANGEL so great was that the show not only focused on the central arc concerning Angel, but also featured fully developed arcs for all the major characters.  The show was not simply about Angel, but almost equally about the other characters as well.  Although Angel was clearly the central character, the show was very much about the chosen family that was created around him.  Cordelia, Doyle, Wesley, Gunn, Fred, Lorne, and finally Spike and Illyria managed to form a caring if frequently dysfunctional family.  Ironically, the one person who was not able to become a part of that family was Angel's own son, who never really meshed either with the overall narrative or with the other characters.But at the center of the show from beginning to end was Angel's quest to try and be a force for good despite all the evil he afflicted.  He wasn't in the least convinced that he could make amends (""Amends"" was, in fact, the title of possibly the greatest of the Angel episodes on BUFFY) and he was pretty much convinced that in the end good might not win out over evil, but something he tells Detective Kate Lockley in the Season Two episode ""Epiphany"" gets to the heart of the show.  Although she never invites him into his house, he nevertheless is able to enter her apartment when he realizes that she has attempted suicide.  He helps save her life and afterwards they are talking.  He explains that he has to strive to do what is right not knowing if he will be successful, knowing that ""there are no big wins.""  This is similar to the idea expressed in the very last line in the series, when Angel tells his friends, faced with fighting an overwhelming army of evil creatures, ""Let's get to work.""  The whole idea is to not worry about results, but only worry about intent, to make sure you are striving to do good, to not give up or into despair.It was not a perfect show.  It was, in fact, a fairly unlucky show.  There were also a couple of ill-advised story arcs.  In Season Three there was the absolutely bizarre idea of Angel's son Connor, easily the most unpopular character in the Slayerverse, rivaled distantly by Dawn on BUFFY.  Even worse was the decision to make Cordy evil in Season Four.  And even worse was the abuse of the magnificent Gina Torres as Jasmine in Season Four.  The result was that the last quarter of Season Three (in what was otherwise a magnificent season) and most of Season Four were possibly the worst thing that ever happened on a Joss Whedon show.  Even worse than all of this was the brief sexual pairing of Connor and Evil Cordy in Season Four, a sequence that registered as high on the Ick-o-meter as anything ever seen on prime time television.  Things were also hurt by Charisma Carpenter's unanticipated leave of absence towards the end of Season Three (which caused some rapid rewriting of several episodes) and her delay in informing Whedon and Co. that she was pregnant in Season Four.  This resulted in her being written out of the show, though she did make a wonderful farewell appearance in a single Season Five episode.But despite the problems with the end of Season Three and the myriad of problems in Season Four, the show never ceased to be less than fascinating.  Even Season Four had some marvelous episodes, including the haunting season premiere, the marvelous comic episode ""Spin the Bottle,"" and the three-part Faith sequence in the middle of the season.  There were also some amazing special effects in Season Four as well as the Beast, an absolutely haunting Big Bad.  The show did manage to rally for a wonderful Season Five, complete with the addition of Spike from BUFFY.  By the end of the season Spike and Angel had come to form a great team and had the show returned for another year the show would have become something of a buddy show centered on them.Speaking of Season Six, we know something of what would have happened thanks to producer Jeffrey Bell, who shared some of the ideas they were developing.  There was, for instance, talk of an episode in which Angel and Spike would have undertaken a case that would have required them to go in drag.  But the most fascinating arc definitely centered on Illyria.  Although the goddess Illyria had taken over Fred's body, supposedly destroying her soul, in Season Six we would have found that this was wrong.  Allyson Hanigan would have guest starred as Willow and would have performed a spell that would have allowed Fred to come back.  Illyria, however, would not have disappeared.  Instead, Amy Acker would have played both characters.  When Bell in interviews shared all this my anger at the WB (good riddance to a bad network) reflamed.  Wesley would not, of course, have died had there been a Season Six, and I can just imagine the dynamics between Wesley and Fred on the one hand, and an intensely powerful Illyria who had something resembling a crush on Wesley.Still, the good on the show dramatically outweighed the bad and even at its worst it remained one of the best shows on television.  And although one can be angry at it being cancelled when there were still some wonderful story arcs to be told, one can also be grateful that we got five full seasons.  It definitely goes on the list of the best shows on television of the past twenty years.",5,A great show about one person's search for the possibility of redemption,1186272000,"08 5,

But Angel's wisdom and angelic qualities are almost SUMMARIZED in these two 2-part episodes.""so I'm free?""- Faith""Don't know about that, but the door is open.""- AngelFaith walks out Angel follows""what are you gonna do? walk out into that darkness? I once told you you don't have to go into that darkness remember? Said it was your choice. Well you chose. Five by five right Faith? But it swallowed you whole. So tell me, how did you like it?""Faith punch Angel on the face""Help me.""""Yeah.""season two: The Darla arcs still remain to be one of the hightlights of the series. The fact that Angel changed so much just the experience with this single person is thought-provoking. It showed his obsession, his darkness, his caring, and his epiphany.""Look, no matter how good a boy you are, God doesn't want you! But I still do""- Dear Boy""Favor? Is that what you think? you think you did me a favor? you damned me!""- Darla""I'm not gonna leave you, every moment you have left, I'll be at your side, you'll never be alone again""- The Trial""If nothing we do matters, then all that matters is what we do, now today, the smallest act of kindness is the greatest thing in the world""- EpiphanySeason three: Darla's sacrifice, and Wesley's betrayal instantly jumps out as this season's strong points. This season is where everything that could go wrong went wrong, and the role each character plays to either provoke it, or fight it.""this child, Angel, is the one good thing we have ever done, the ONLY good thing, you be sure to tell him that.""- Lullaby""you think you know something about living because you had this really long life, but then one day you wake up, and find that you have something else...I had a son""- Double Or NothingSeason Four: The darkest of all the seasons. The writers of Angel brilliantly let this season to be the big bad happening instead of the last season, or that every season there is a BIG ending (this is also one major difference from Buffy, in which every seasons of Buffy Buffy has to stop a big bad at the end of the season). Angel's leadership shone out brightly in this season, that the Fang Gang just could not make it out if it weren't for him, and of course, that brilliantly tragic and bittersweet ending of Home, what I consider the saddest storyline I have EVER seen that doesn't involve a single death- sounds impossible? well see it for yourself, if you don't cry after watching Home, I would seriously consider that either you don't get it or you have no soul- I'm serious.""nothing in this world is the way it ought to be, it's harsh and cruel. That's why there's us, Champions. Doesn't matter where we come from, what we've done or suffered, or even if we make a difference. We live as though the world were as it should be, to show it what it can be""- Deep Down""I know how that feels, because I want to give you everything. I want to take back the mistakes, and help you start over""- HomeSeason Five: the saddest and most depressing of all the seasons. This is where the killathon is- in which Joss just decides to kill EVERY SINGLE one member of the Angel team (hehe). But the gist is, every single death was wrote heartbreaking and memorable. Our heros are sent to certain death but went out with a bang, thus Not Fade Away is the perfect title for the last episode of Angel, it concluded the show's theme. This conclusion is in my opinion, the most controversial, revolutionary and brilliant conclusion I've seen on anything. I truly believe now all the shows are copying Angel in that they are doing a cliffhanger on everything (hehe).""We cling to what is gone, is there anything else in this world but grief?""""there's love...and hope...for some. There's hope that your life will lead you to some joy, that after all that's happened, you may still be surprised""- Shells""let's get to work""- Not Fade AwayAngel is just the most brilliant, thought-provoking, and memorable show I have ever seen period, it will affect people for generations to come.

951981,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B000BWFWFK,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 2]","Angel aired from 1999-2004 during five great seasons after what it was unfortunatly cancelled and that decision made by the WB network is still questionned now.Originally a spin-off from the popular Buffy The Vampire Slayer,it became much more as it had a life of its own and it appealed to a more mature audience who liked the darker edge of the series.Angel was a character on Buffy for the first three seasons and the vampire with a soul then moved to Los Angeles the city of lost angels(rim shot)to form his crime investigations.Angel met quite a few people over the years and many people worked for him,he fought many monsters.At first there was only Angel,Cordelia and Doyle but it grew to have Wesley,Guns,Fred,Lornes,Harmony and even Spike coming to the series.It might have only last five seasons but that left us some great televison that we can now enjoy anytime we want on DVD.As far as I am concerned there are three parts to Angel:The first part,season one is the introduction of the series with a monster-of-the-week approach and is an excellent first season,it is to note that this is a full season with 22 episodes as each Angel seasons had.Angel starts his dectective agency with ex-Buffy Cordelia and Doyle's help.Doyle dies and is replaced by Wesley a former Buffy as well,we also meet Charles Gun who at the time was a Vampire Hunter and was basicly living in the streets with his gang.The second part is season 2 to 4.In the second season vampire Darla who was Angel's lover a long time ago(and turned him into a vampire)returns and gets pregnant by the end of the season.There are up and downs to this relationnship and it gets Angel mad and he turns against his friends for a bref period of time(also in this season,Angel sings karaoke wich is priceless!).In season three Darla is carrying Angel's son Connor and he nearly didn't get born due to his parents.Holtz with whom Angel had encounters in the past returns and wants to kill the child.Wesley steals Connor and Holtz steals it from him.There are lots of emotions in this season and Angel needs to deal with the fact that he now is a father.Season four was very confusing with all that was going on and it was really crazy.This is when Cordelia left the series(before coming back briefly for Angel's 100th episode in the fifth season)and the issue with her and Connor was unappropriate and rather shocking.Angel is a the bottom of the ocean,a new character Jasmine is introduced but her role wasn't good enough and didn't last long enough.There is also this issue about a beast.Its at the end of the season that Angel Investigations are being given control of Wolfram And Hart office wich opens the door for some more stories and the fifth season of Angel.Season five returns to its monster-of-the-week format and completes the serie.After being given control of the LA Wolfram And Hart office they can't stop wondering what the catch is.Spike returns from the dead at the beggening of the season and adds much interrest in the series and it was thrilling to see him on Angel.The first half of the season is great episodes wile the second half turns more dramatic with the Fred/Illyria story and Wesley comfronts his father.Angel makes a deal with the devil and we loose some of the crew members.It ended good in my opinion,but the ending receved mixed reactions.It was definatly the funniest season.The set has all the thirty discs from the sets with their respective special features,wich are pretty good with some interviews and the 100th celebration and great stuff truly.It doesn't offer anything more than a convenient size and the possibility to buy the entire series all at once without looking for each separate seasons.It looks great with a nice box and the discs are placed by seasons inside and it was done really well,but ou have to see it to know what I mean.The only problem I have is the price amazon.ca sells it for.Over 100 bucks for this package when if you look well you can find each seasons for 14.99?No thanks i'd rather buy them speratly but if this set comes at a lower price(it might be right now depending when you are reading this)and you are a fan of the show then go for it.If not for the price its nice.It also comes with a booklet that gives info about each episodes and tell wich season they are on.The packaging was really done well for this set I'll tell you what.The big problem with this is that you HAVE to be a fan of the show to buy this otherwise you might end up wasting money.If you are a fan who doesn't own the seasons but always wanted to and see this at a decnt price then go for it.Otherwise try to catch the show or rent a season then decide.Angel really is different than Buffy and its great on its own,with many great episodes and a fascinating story that you really get caught in,great television in perspective.",4,"""The Complete

951983,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000BWFWFK,trashcanman,"[20, 23]","So ""Angel"" is just a spin-off of the legendary ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series right?  Surely Joss Whedon just delivered this as some sort of a second-rate cash-in to Buffy's success by focusing on her [...] goody two-shoes vampire ex-boyfriend.  So why bother?  Well, how about the fact that the show started off damn near as good as ""Buffy"" and was arguably better when some dimwit at the WB decided to pull the plug after what is easily one of the finest seasons of sci-fi/fantasy television ever to hit the air.  Angel is set up as a lonely soul who begins protecting the citizens of the night in Los Angeles from vampires and demons.  He quickly meets a friend who speaks of his destiny and mission and then meets a familiar face, Buffy's friend/rival Cordelia Chase, currently pursuing an acting career.  The threesome form a small detective agency specializing in supernatural cases and vowing to ""help the helpless"".  Along the way, we find that Angel is to be a major instrument of the coming apocalypse, but it is unclear whether it will be as a hero to save the day or as his super-villainesqe alter-ego, Angelus, to help end the world.  Remember, Angel was the worst killer in vampire history until gypsies restored his soul so that he would feel the agony of regret over his past deeds for all eternity.  Should Angel lose his soul (by experiencing a moment of perfect happpiness; nice touch, jerks), then Angelus will arise from within Angel and wreak havok once again.  But it's not all dark, brooding, and depressing; far from it, the show is actually quite light-hearted much of the time.  Like in ""Buffy"" (and all of Whedon's work, for that matter), character humor is almost always at the forefront. The show veers from kicking butt to causing tears of laughter to breaking your heart as effortlessly as any show ever has.The first season returned to a familiar monster/metaphor-of-the-week formula, but while ""Buffy"" focused on teen and, later, young adult issues ""Angel"" used supernatural metaphors to explore 20 and 30-something issues such as the singles bar scene, corporate exploitation, and street violence.  Season one was also predictably full of ""Buffy"" cross-overs and familiar faces from that show's past and present, but regardless of the fact that this was just an easy way to pull in viewers, the result is nearly flawless entertainment that makes you WANT to watch both shows. In the best example of this, rogue vampire hunter Faith flees from Buffy after assaulting her in Sunnydale on that show and winds up meeting up with Angel's crew the week after in L.A.  When Buffy shows up to take her pound of flesh out of a repentant Faith's rear, Angel is forced to step in and confront the love of his life to save his enemy's soul.  Viewed along with the Buffy's episodes, you've got a complete and compelling story of my personal favorite character from either show.  Season two really hit it's stride by bringing back Angel's vampiric sire, Darla, and eventually her delightfully insane makeshift sister, Drusilla, a victim of Angelus's past transgressions.  Angel's battles with his ex-family lead him and the show to very dark places, placing distance between his new family, which now includes an vampire hunting gang leader named Gunn and Buffy's ex-watcher (and former bozo), Wesley.  Seasons three and four are filled with brilliance, but take a few turns for the worst when the inevitable kid becomes involved.  Teen angst adds nothing to this show in my opinion and puts these two seasons head-and-shoulders beneath the other three.  This is not to say that they aren't awesome and absolutely vital viewing for any fan of the supernatural genre, they just aren't of the flawless caliber of seasons, one, two, and five.  If you minimize the overwrought Connor-based storylines, seasons three and four are still absolute top-notch entertainment and deliver some of the series' greatest moments, not the least of which is the anticipated return of Angelus, just in time for the apocalypse.  Season five is a complete rebirth of the series and, in my opinion, it is the absolute peak of the show that arguably surpasses ""Buffy"" on many levels.  We say our tearful goodbyes to beloved characters and welcome more in their place.  Bringing back Angelus's old comrade Spike (now with a soul of his own, muddying up the waters of the old prophecy) was considered a bad move by many, but I've always found the character's snarky humor irresistable. When Illyria, an ancient goddess of formerly all-consuming power, shows up in shocking fashion the result is a consistently intriguing side-story that runs the length of the season and a great new character unlike any I've ever seen. In another example of Joss Whedon's bizarre and brilliant genius, Angel is transformed into a puppet (think ""Crank Yankers"") and forced to battle other demon-possessed puppets running a children's show.  This is easily my favorite episode of the entire series and, like the ""Buffy"" musical before it, shows just how hysterically entertaining an episode of television can be.  So, are you convinced that Angel deserved his own show yet?  If not, just trust me and buy this very nicely priced DVD collection.  If you loved ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" you will not, you can not be disappointed by ""Angel"".",5,An indespensable companion to the greatest live-action series ever.,1186012800,"08 2,

There is not a single episode that I really want to view again a second time. Its worth watching and has merit, but unlike my Buffy collection, it will not be revisited. For Buffy fans, we need our fix, this is all we have, but its not the same.4 years later Revised Review:I went back and must have re-watched about 3/4 of the episodes 20 times over the years and enjoyed it... Maybe I was bored of re-watching Buffy 100 times and needed a break, all I know is that I thank god i bought this.",3,Revised Review,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,620,"['Original', 'Review', 'acting', 'cast', 'characters', 'dialog', 'themes', 'humor', 'filming', 'are', 'not', 'Buffy', 'level', 'not', 'single', 'episode', 'really', 'want', 'view', 'again', 'second', 'time', 'worth', 'watching', 'merit', 'Buffy', 'collection', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'revisited', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'need', 'fix', 'have', 'not', 'same.4', 'years', 'later', 'Revised', 'Review', 'went', 'back', 'must', 'have', 're-watched', '3/4', 'episodes', '20', 'times', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'Maybe', 'was', 'bored', 're-watching', 'Buffy', '100', 'times', 'needed', 'break', 'know', 'thank', 'god', 'i', 'bought']",Angel - Seasons 1-5
