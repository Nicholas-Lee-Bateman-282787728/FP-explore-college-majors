Davis plays an outspoken, brash, high-profile, American-born French countess (by marriage).  She and her two children, a son and a daughter, plunge into peril when Davis compulsively decides to help Neill, a British flier shot down over France.  Their first interaction is classic -- Davis packs quite a wallop!Davis goes on to become a player in helping downed allied fliers escape from occupied territory.In the meantime, a Nazi officer is bound and determined to make an example of Davis...and thus the story develops and continues through the end of the war.This is a &quot;must-watch&quot; movie.  There is action, intruige, and incredible courage in the face of danger.5 stars all the way!

500937,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B00000G08Q,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[40, 40]","Judy Davis and Sam Neill have appeared together in a number of films.  They work so well together you think they must be like Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy--married in real life--but alas they are not. I first saw  them in a film made 'down under' (I think they are both Australian)  &quot;My Brilliant Career.&quot;  Sam was chasing Judy, and as usual she  was spurning him.In this wonderful Hallmark Hall of Fame production,  Judy Davis plays the Comtesse Mary Lindell, two-time winner of the 'Croix  de Guerre' and Sam Neille plays a British pilot shot down over France in  the early days of WWII who goes on to become a Brigadier General. The  Comtesse Mary Lindell inadvertantly saves Neill--the downed pilot--and  thereby hangs a tale.The Comtesse Lindell is a heroine girls can look up  to. As a French citizen and a Comtesse, she was relatively unmolested by  the Germans when they invaded France and would not have appeared to have  had a stong motive to do the things she did and risk her life and the lives  of her children. Lindell's daughter actually became involved with a German  officer. However, Lindell had been a Red Cross nurse in WWI, for which she  was awarded the Croix de Guerre for her assistance to both French and  German soldiers alike, and she was a compassionate and caring person.In  WWII, Lindell developed a stake in the salvation of British, American,  Canadian and other Allied pilots, because she accidently saved the life of  a single British pilot. He spread the word, and before she knew it, she was  inundated with downed pilots seeking her assistance. She could not stand by  and watch the Nazis shoot them in the street, in the churches, anywhere  they found them.  When she was captuered and imprisoned for assisting the  enemy, her son stood in for her.  Eventually, she was released and resumed  her underground career. Her son and her daughter, her friends and a host of  other partisans helped her form the &quot;Marie&quot; underground network  which smuggled countless Allied airmen out of harm's way through the  southern border of France. For her heroism, Lindell was awarded another  'Croix de Guerre' at the end of the war.This is a fine video, well  constructed, and a joy to watch.

Thank God that HALLMARK took the time to recreate her daringly true escapades in smuggling evaders into unoccupied zones during WW2. For dramatic purposes, much of ONE AGAINST THE WIND has been rearranged and condensed . As exciting as this presentation of Mary Lindell's exploits is, her real life was even MORE dramatic than what HALLMARK assembled!( Read the book NO DRUMS,NO TRUMPETS by J.B. Wayne!!!!!)Nevertheless, this film is extraordinary for what it accomplishes and Judy Davis is spot-on as the resourceful,courageous and mulishly strong-minded Mary. It is significant to note that Mary Lindell was 45 years old when she and her family began smuggling people out of occupied France, first by sheer bluff and boldness! Her methods became much more ""professional"" as the War dragged on. The focus of ONE AGAINST THE WIND is more towards the end of her smuggling people into Spain, more in particular Australian bomber pilot McSweyen (Sam Neill).Lindell actually had three children, two boys and a little girl.The son Maurice, is a composite of her two sons, and daughter Barbe (Kate Beckinsale) is pretty much invented along with her attraction to a Nazi officer for dramatic purposes.This makes for a great screenplay and creates dramatic tension, but it's not true. Other than that, ONE AGAINST THE WIND is about as exciting and daredevilish as a film can get (especially for HALLMARK!).Great similar companion films would be BLACK BOOK, VARIAN'S WAR and CHARLOTTE GRAY.",5,"Judy Davis as ""THE MATI HARI"" of France,Mary Lindell",1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,1532,"['Mary', 'Lindell', 'household', 'name', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Thank', 'God', 'HALLMARK', 'took', 'time', 'recreate', 'daringly', 'true', 'escapades', 'smuggling', 'evaders', 'unoccupied', 'zones', 'WW2', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'much', 'ONE', 'AGAINST', 'THE', 'WIND', 'been', 'rearranged', 'condensed', 'As', 'exciting', 'presentation', 'Mary', 'Lindell', 'exploits', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'even', 'MORE', 'dramatic', 'what', 'HALLMARK', 'assembled', 'Read', 'book', 'NO', 'DRUMS', 'NO', 'TRUMPETS', 'J.B', 'Wayne', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'what', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'spot-on', 'resourceful', 'courageous', 'mulishly', 'strong-minded', 'Mary', 'significant', 'note', 'Mary', 'Lindell', 'was', '45', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'family', 'began', 'smuggling', 'people', 'occupied', 'France', 'first', 'sheer', 'bluff', 'boldness', 'methods', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'professional', 'War', 'dragged', 'focus', 'ONE', 'AGAINST', 'THE', 'WIND', 'more', 'end', 'smuggling', 'people', 'Spain', 'more', 'particular', 'Australian', 'bomber', 'pilot', 'McSweyen', 'Sam', 'Neill', '.Lindell', 'actually', 'had', 'three', 'children', 'two', 'boys', 'little', 'girl.The', 'son', 'Maurice', 'composite', 'two', 'sons', 'daughter', 'Barbe', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'pretty', 'much', 'invented', 'attraction', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'dramatic', 'purposes.This', 'great', 'screenplay', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'not', 'true', 'Other', 'ONE', 'AGAINST', 'THE', 'WIND', 'exciting', 'daredevilish', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'especially', 'HALLMARK', '.Great', 'similar', 'companion', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'BLACK', 'BOOK', 'VARIAN', 'WAR', 'CHARLOTTE', 'GRAY']",N/A
