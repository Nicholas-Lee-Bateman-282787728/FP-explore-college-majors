This film makes me think and wonder and continues to haunt the corners of my mind. Too many times I have found movies that affected me as a child only to be disappointed by my adult viewing. This film is NOT one of those. It is nearly as effective as it was and I enjoyed watching it again.This is a story with implied complexity yet pushes nothing upon its audience. It presents its tale, admittedly, sometimes in clumsy narrative, but makes only broad or suggested inferences leaving interpretation up to the viewer. While the effects were simple (it was made for TV in the 70's) they are effective and mostly hold up, the locations, music, settings, style and Connie Sellecca herself all add to haunting and lyrical feel to this tale. It is not an easy film and is, quite frankly, tragic. Many questions are presented and most are unanswered (or at least left for you to answer), yet this only adds to its mystique. Despite its fantasy and horror elements it is not scary and there are no cheap shocks so it is safe for kids.This is just a fantastic and weird classic in its own right and I would love for it to gain more of a following.The Warner Brothers DVD picture looks great and it is clean and attractive. I suspect this DVD picture looks better than the original broadcast. The DVD is devoid of special features but for something as rare as this, I don't care at all. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something different and for parents looking to broaden their children's horizons in regards to fiction and different types of storytelling.",5,Hauntingly complex with no easy answers.,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,1660,"['Echoing', 'so', 'many', 'saw', 'young', 'stuck', 'just', 'watched', 'again', 'adult', 'film', 'think', 'wonder', 'haunt', 'corners', 'mind', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'found', 'movies', 'affected', 'child', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed', 'adult', 'viewing', 'film', 'NOT', 'one', 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'story', 'implied', 'complexity', 'yet', 'nothing', 'audience', 'tale', 'admittedly', 'sometimes', 'clumsy', 'narrative', 'only', 'broad', 'suggested', 'inferences', 'leaving', 'interpretation', 'up', 'viewer', 'effects', 'were', 'simple', 'was', 'made', 'TV', '70', 'are', 'effective', 'mostly', 'hold', 'up', 'locations', 'music', 'settings', 'style', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'add', 'haunting', 'lyrical', 'feel', 'tale', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'tragic', 'Many', 'questions', 'are', 'presented', 'most', 'are', 'unanswered', 'least', 'left', 'answer', 'yet', 'only', 'mystique', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'elements', 'not', 'scary', 'are', 'cheap', 'shocks', 'safe', 'kids.This', 'just', 'fantastic', 'weird', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'would', 'love', 'gain', 'more', 'following.The', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'DVD', 'picture', 'great', 'clean', 'attractive', 'suspect', 'DVD', 'picture', 'better', 'original', 'broadcast', 'DVD', 'devoid', 'special', 'features', 'something', 'as', 'rare', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'parents', 'looking', 'broaden', 'children', 'horizons', 'regards', 'fiction', 'different', 'types', 'storytelling']",N/A

Seeing it these many decades later, I find that I am less enamored by it than I thought I would be.  Memory is a funny thing.  It's not quite as haunting as I recall.  There is no mystery, no sense of overwhelming sadness; things that I originally felt were an integral part of this movie.  Instead, I found it slow going with long stretches on little to no dialog.  Half the time the characters just stood there posing.  It lacked a sense of emotion that I found odd.  Except for a few isolated outbursts, the character/actors were rather flat in their performances, languid.  There was no attempt to elaborate on ""the one below.""  The turtle was just a turtle; this movie was no competition for Jaws.  This second viewing left me singularly unimpressed.

1277198,A1ZTIK26TACL5B,B002LV1C0S,kozmikrokker,"[1, 1]","I can't believe I've never seen this on one of the satellite stations or local TV. It's a good movie. NOT a B movie at all. Connie Selleca is beautiful of course, and very mysterious too. Apparently she made a pact with the devil to save herself from a ship about to be destroyed at sea and the devil changed her into a supernatural being that is immortal, like the ""IT"" clown. She's not quite that evil in this movie though. She says eventually that she knows she made the wrong decision. Carl Weathers is believable as a marine biologist graduate student working under Burl Ives who is a marine biology professor down near Bermuda studying gigantism in deep sea marine life.The story surrounds Connie Selleca and a kid named Magnus who she appeared to while he was a child, she also had the ability to appear as a child. He saw her go swimming out to sea, of course, and never come back! Also when he was a kid, his father, a marine biologist known to Burl Ives and Carl Weathers, is killed in some sort of attack by a sea creature though the details are not revealed to Magnus at that age. Years later, while he is a young adult, he comes back to the island and meets her again, this time she's about his same age and looking very gorgeous of course. She of course leaves each meeting with him by swimming back out to sea and he never really wonders why although he once asks her where her house is. In addition to this part of the story, there is another element involving a giant turtle that the biologist team, including Magnus, who is known by the team via his father, is trying to catch. Unsuccessfully. It keeps breaking all their lines and nets.There is a legend that has been built up about people who have seen the sea woman Connie Selleca over the past 250 years and she always appears to men about to die at sea and one of the local ""voodoo"" women who is a servant at Burl Ives' house tries to warn Magnus to stay away from her. In the end he survives, though, even if others do not.So it's definitely worth watching and owning, in contrast to other reviewers I don't think it's a kids movie at all, although they have the power to enjoy it. It's not above their understanding. Good story and acting generally, though I was not too impressed with the guy playing Magnus. There are a few carefully placed special effects which still look good. Definitely check it out.",4,A good movie,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,2381,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'satellite', 'stations', 'local', 'TV', 'good', 'movie', 'B', 'movie', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'beautiful', 'course', 'very', 'mysterious', 'too', 'Apparently', 'made', 'pact', 'devil', 'save', 'ship', 'be', 'destroyed', 'sea', 'devil', 'changed', 'supernatural', 'being', 'immortal', 'IT', 'clown', 'not', 'quite', 'evil', 'movie', 'eventually', 'made', 'wrong', 'decision', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'believable', 'marine', 'biologist', 'graduate', 'student', 'working', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'who', 'marine', 'biology', 'professor', 'down', 'near', 'Bermuda', 'studying', 'gigantism', 'deep', 'sea', 'marine', 'life.The', 'story', 'surrounds', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'kid', 'named', 'Magnus', 'who', 'appeared', 'was', 'child', 'also', 'had', 'ability', 'appear', 'child', 'saw', 'go', 'swimming', 'out', 'sea', 'course', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'Also', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'father', 'marine', 'biologist', 'known', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'killed', 'sort', 'attack', 'sea', 'creature', 'details', 'are', 'not', 'revealed', 'Magnus', 'age', 'Years', 'later', 'young', 'adult', 'back', 'island', 'again', 'time', 'same', 'age', 'looking', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'course', 'course', 'meeting', 'swimming', 'back', 'sea', 'never', 'really', 'wonders', 'why', 'once', 'where', 'house', 'addition', 'part', 'story', 'element', 'involving', 'giant', 'turtle', 'biologist', 'team', 'including', 'Magnus', 'who', 'known', 'team', 'father', 'trying', 'catch', 'Unsuccessfully', 'breaking', 'lines', 'nets.There', 'legend', 'been', 'built', 'up', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'sea', 'woman', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'past', '250', 'years', 'always', 'men', 'die', 'sea', 'one', 'local', 'voodoo', 'women', 'who', 'servant', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'house', 'tries', 'warn', 'Magnus', 'stay', 'away', 'end', 'even', 'others', 'do', 'not.So', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning', 'contrast', 'other', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kids', 'movie', 'have', 'power', 'enjoy', 'not', 'understanding', 'Good', 'story', 'acting', 'generally', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'impressed', 'guy', 'playing', 'Magnus', 'are', 'few', 'carefully', 'placed', 'special', 'effects', 'still', 'look', 'good', 'Definitely', 'check', 'out']",N/A
