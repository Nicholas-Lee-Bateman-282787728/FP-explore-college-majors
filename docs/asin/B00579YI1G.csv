1444580,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00579YI1G,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 6]","I finally had the privilege of watching this film the other night, and I must admit that I was love-struck.  I'm not even truly certain what I witnessed, but I know that it was brilliant.  Shortly after viewing it I jotted down a few notes for my blog.  They went a little something like this:Surprisingly visual...emotionally compacted...ambiguously conclusive; masterpiece?  Probably.The film centers on three couples and a guide, searching for water on the Oregon Trail in the 1800's.  The guide, the flamboyant Meek, is an enigma himself, joyful and confident yet elusive and seemingly shady.  He does not sway nor does he instill any sense of confidence in Emily, the strongest female in the bunch and certainly the most prominent `opinion' focused upon in the film.  Emily regards Meek as an ignorant liar who has conned her family and friends, and so she despises him with cold stares and harsh words.  When the group encounters a Cayuse Indian, things begin to shift as they attempt to use the Indian as a means to find water.  The group is indecisive in their view of the Indian (some think he's dangerous and want him dead, others think he's merely useless yet some feel confident he'll bring them to water).Kelly Reichardt works wonders behind the camera here.  I've only seen one other film of hers, `Wendy and Lucy', and I must say that as much as I loved that film (and Williams should have been up for the Oscar), Reichardt really upped her game with her latest feature.  `Meek's Cutoff' is a stunning film.  As I mentioned, it's surprisingly visual.  I never would have guessed that cracked earth and dead grass could be so beautiful, but nearly every frame is a visual masterpiece.  Even the color of the dresses is like beautiful flowers on a densely colored canvas.  The pacing is also a joy because it milks the atmosphere perfectly.  Segments of no dialog allow the audience to feel the emotion dripping from sullen faces and truly take in the harsh reality of the surroundings.  Michele Williams (possibly THE actress of her generation) is the perfect `prop' for this sort of film because her face is her strongest asset. Certain actors portray such strength with a certain part of their body (Blanchett has her voice, Scott Thomas has her body and the way she can move it with such fluid force) and Michele Williams just has this face that makes such an impact.She looks right through you; to your soul.The ending may feel underwhelming to some, but the ambiguous nature of it actually serves the film well.  This is a character study, one that is elusive to the naked eye and so the way in which the ending falls (with that `tree of life' casting shaded comfort over the group) is a delicate touch that seals the deal in making `Meek's Cutoff' an unforgettably astute and unique viewing experience.",5,And cut...,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2822,"['finally', 'had', 'privilege', 'watching', 'film', 'other', 'night', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'love-struck', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'truly', 'certain', 'what', 'witnessed', 'know', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Shortly', 'viewing', 'jotted', 'down', 'few', 'notes', 'blog', 'went', 'little', 'something', 'Surprisingly', 'visual', 'emotionally', 'compacted', 'ambiguously', 'conclusive', 'masterpiece', 'Probably.The', 'film', 'centers', 'three', 'couples', 'guide', 'searching', 'water', 'Oregon', 'Trail', '1800', 'guide', 'flamboyant', 'Meek', 'enigma', 'joyful', 'confident', 'yet', 'elusive', 'seemingly', 'shady', 'not', 'sway', 'instill', 'sense', 'confidence', 'Emily', 'strongest', 'female', 'bunch', 'certainly', 'most', 'prominent', 'opinion', 'focused', 'film', 'Emily', 'Meek', 'ignorant', 'liar', 'who', 'conned', 'family', 'friends', 'so', 'cold', 'stares', 'harsh', 'words', 'When', 'group', 'Cayuse', 'Indian', 'things', 'begin', 'shift', 'attempt', 'use', 'Indian', 'means', 'find', 'water', 'group', 'indecisive', 'view', 'Indian', 'think', 'dangerous', 'want', 'dead', 'others', 'think', 'merely', 'useless', 'yet', 'feel', 'confident', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'water', '.Kelly', 'Reichardt', 'wonders', 'camera', 'here', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'hers', 'Wendy', 'Lucy', 'must', 'say', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'film', 'Williams', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'Oscar', 'Reichardt', 'really', 'upped', 'game', 'latest', 'feature', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'stunning', 'film', 'mentioned', 'surprisingly', 'visual', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'cracked', 'earth', 'dead', 'grass', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'beautiful', 'nearly', 'frame', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'Even', 'color', 'dresses', 'beautiful', 'flowers', 'densely', 'colored', 'canvas', 'pacing', 'also', 'joy', 'atmosphere', 'perfectly', 'Segments', 'dialog', 'allow', 'audience', 'feel', 'emotion', 'dripping', 'sullen', 'truly', 'take', 'harsh', 'reality', 'surroundings', 'Michele', 'Williams', 'possibly', 'THE', 'actress', 'generation', 'perfect', 'prop', 'sort', 'film', 'face', 'strongest', 'asset', 'Certain', 'actors', 'portray', 'such', 'strength', 'certain', 'part', 'body', 'Blanchett', 'voice', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'body', 'way', 'can', 'move', 'such', 'fluid', 'force', 'Michele', 'Williams', 'just', 'face', 'impact.She', 'right', 'soul.The', 'ending', 'may', 'feel', 'underwhelming', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'actually', 'film', 'well', 'character', 'study', 'one', 'elusive', 'naked', 'eye', 'so', 'way', 'ending', 'falls', 'tree', 'life', 'casting', 'shaded', 'comfort', 'group', 'delicate', 'touch', 'deal', 'making', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'unforgettably', 'astute', 'unique', 'viewing', 'experience']",Meek's Cutoff
1444581,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00579YI1G,Artist & Author,"[18, 26]","Frankly, the longer I watched this movie the more angry I became.  First, Meek's wagon train consisted of some 200 wagons and about a thousand people!  They had nearly 4,000 cattle/oxen with them!  About the only accurate aspect of the movie was that they were almost always looking for water.  [It takes  LOT of water for that many people and livestock!]  By the end of the movie, I actually got out a magnifying glass to see if someplace on the DVD cover it said it was one of a multiple-DVD set because it just stopped . . . no ending.  I guess the producers ran out of money.What most made me angry was the movie's depiction of the Indian.  First of all, Stephen Meek (whose niece, Helen, died two years later from untreated measles during her captivity in the Whitman massacre) who had lived and traveled nearly twenty years in the Rocky Mountain areas certainly would have known sign language and how to get ideas across to Indians whose language he did not speak.  It is true that the group met a lone Indian, a member of the Warm Springs tribe.  But, he walked openly into their camp, was given food and then Meek asked how to get to the Dalles.  The Indian agreed, for a blanket, to guide them on the 5-day trek.  Along the way, they met more Warm Springs Indians, one of them being able to speak some English.  They led them to the Deschutes River, where the tribe was fishing, and showed the emigrants where there was a place to cross the river (which took two week for all to get across).  From everything I've read on it, the Indians they encountered showed every sign of friendliness, and did not deserve the way the movie's Meek and many of the others treated him.In stark contrast with the Indian's help, as they neared the Dalles they sent a group to the Methodist mission there for help . . . . and were refused.",1,A True Story????,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,1830,"['Frankly', 'longer', 'watched', 'movie', 'more', 'angry', 'became', 'First', 'Meek', 'wagon', 'train', 'consisted', '200', 'wagons', 'thousand', 'people', 'had', 'nearly', '4,000', 'cattle/oxen', 'only', 'accurate', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'looking', 'water', '[', 'LOT', 'water', 'many', 'people', 'livestock', ']', 'end', 'movie', 'actually', 'got', 'out', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'see', 'someplace', 'DVD', 'cover', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'multiple-DVD', 'set', 'just', 'stopped', 'ending', 'guess', 'producers', 'ran', 'money.What', 'most', 'made', 'angry', 'was', 'movie', 'depiction', 'Indian', 'First', 'all', 'Stephen', 'Meek', 'niece', 'Helen', 'died', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'untreated', 'measles', 'captivity', 'Whitman', 'massacre', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'traveled', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'areas', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'sign', 'language', 'how', 'get', 'ideas', 'Indians', 'language', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'true', 'group', 'met', 'lone', 'Indian', 'member', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'tribe', 'walked', 'openly', 'camp', 'was', 'given', 'food', 'then', 'Meek', 'asked', 'how', 'get', 'Dalles', 'Indian', 'agreed', 'blanket', 'guide', '5-day', 'trek', 'way', 'met', 'more', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'Indians', 'one', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'English', 'led', 'Deschutes', 'River', 'where', 'tribe', 'was', 'fishing', 'showed', 'emigrants', 'where', 'was', 'place', 'cross', 'river', 'took', 'two', 'week', 'get', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Indians', 'encountered', 'showed', 'sign', 'friendliness', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'way', 'movie', 'Meek', 'many', 'others', 'treated', 'him.In', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Indian', 'help', 'neared', 'Dalles', 'sent', 'group', 'Methodist', 'mission', 'there', 'help', 'were', 'refused']",Meek's Cutoff

1444584,AKV2BGUT50B1X,B00579YI1G,Carl Robinson,"[1, 2]","Meek's Cutoff is a Western movie but in no way should it be considered a normal Western of the old time Saturday Morning fare.  It is a Western more along the lines of a John Ford Western in that it speaks to a condition of man by using a Western theme.  It differs from both in that it is slow, quiet, and dialogue is often carried out with only firelight for lighting.  Thus the movie is a far cry from John Ford movies in that there are no colorful, hammy characters and there are no sudden violent scenes.This movie should not be considered historically accurate by any means.  Some of the story of the Meek's Cutoff pioneers is portrayed here but on the whole the movie only loosely describes that story to make a larger point about the condition of man.If anything it is an existentialist parable of modern conditions using the story of the Meek's Cutoff emigrants.The emigrants consist of three families traveling through eastern Oregon using oxen and prairie schooners.  They are guided by Stephen Meek a mountain man and Indian fighter who, presumably, knows something about the area they are crossing.They find that the cutoff is not a short cut in the usual sense and Meek is unsure of where water can be found.  The pioneers' store of water becomes drastically low.Eventually they find and capture an Indian that had been shadowing the emigrants.  They make him an offer, blankets for a clear path to find water.  Of course, the white pioneers can't really bring themselves to fully trust this lone brave.And why should they?  Meek has had many negative dealings with Indians in the past.  Others fear he is signaling to his tribe and leading him to an ambush.The dwindling water, the silence, the inability to understand the Indian gives the movie a whopping tension.  Indeed tension like in this movie can be felt in the real world.  The lost emigrants on Meek's Cutoff are in a situation much like that of the Americans of the Obama Era.  Americans have delegated guiding authority to a person of a background from a tribe of known negative history causing great concern.  Additionally, there is no end in sight to the mounting problems, Americans keep plodding, but the economy remains stuck and no political idea has come about to lead Americans from the desert.There is no support from a higher power.This movie is filmed on location.  The desert looks like the wild territory of 1845 and the styles are likewise from the same era.  The women look wonderful in their bonnets and prairie dresses and one can see just how useful their clothing was.  The firearms are also flintlocks-the producers didn't make the mistake to move technological inventions of the 1890's backwards several decades.",5,Stark and Gripping with Suspense and Tension Throughout,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,2710,"['Meek', 'Cutoff', 'Western', 'movie', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'normal', 'Western', 'old', 'time', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'fare', 'Western', 'more', 'lines', 'John', 'Ford', 'Western', 'condition', 'man', 'using', 'Western', 'theme', 'slow', 'quiet', 'dialogue', 'often', 'carried', 'out', 'only', 'firelight', 'lighting', 'Thus', 'movie', 'far', 'cry', 'John', 'Ford', 'movies', 'are', 'colorful', 'hammy', 'characters', 'are', 'sudden', 'violent', 'scenes.This', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'historically', 'accurate', 'means', 'story', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'pioneers', 'portrayed', 'here', 'whole', 'movie', 'only', 'loosely', 'story', 'make', 'larger', 'point', 'condition', 'man.If', 'anything', 'existentialist', 'parable', 'modern', 'conditions', 'using', 'story', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'emigrants.The', 'emigrants', 'consist', 'three', 'families', 'traveling', 'eastern', 'Oregon', 'using', 'oxen', 'prairie', 'schooners', 'are', 'guided', 'Stephen', 'Meek', 'mountain', 'man', 'Indian', 'fighter', 'who', 'presumably', 'something', 'area', 'are', 'crossing.They', 'find', 'cutoff', 'not', 'short', 'cut', 'usual', 'sense', 'Meek', 'unsure', 'where', 'water', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'pioneers', 'store', 'water', 'becomes', 'drastically', 'low.Eventually', 'find', 'capture', 'Indian', 'had', 'been', 'shadowing', 'emigrants', 'make', 'offer', 'blankets', 'clear', 'path', 'find', 'water', 'course', 'white', 'pioneers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'fully', 'trust', 'lone', 'brave.And', 'why', 'should', 'Meek', 'had', 'many', 'negative', 'dealings', 'Indians', 'past', 'Others', 'fear', 'signaling', 'tribe', 'leading', 'ambush.The', 'dwindling', 'water', 'silence', 'inability', 'understand', 'Indian', 'movie', 'whopping', 'tension', 'Indeed', 'tension', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'real', 'world', 'lost', 'emigrants', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'are', 'situation', 'much', 'Americans', 'Obama', 'Era', 'Americans', 'have', 'delegated', 'guiding', 'authority', 'person', 'background', 'tribe', 'known', 'negative', 'history', 'causing', 'great', 'concern', 'Additionally', 'end', 'sight', 'mounting', 'problems', 'Americans', 'keep', 'plodding', 'economy', 'stuck', 'political', 'idea', 'come', 'lead', 'Americans', 'desert.There', 'support', 'higher', 'power.This', 'movie', 'filmed', 'location', 'desert', 'wild', 'territory', '1845', 'styles', 'are', 'likewise', 'same', 'era', 'women', 'look', 'wonderful', 'bonnets', 'prairie', 'dresses', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'useful', 'clothing', 'was', 'firearms', 'are', 'also', 'flintlocks-the', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'move', 'technological', 'inventions', '1890', 'backwards', 'several', 'decades']",Meek's Cutoff

1444587,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00579YI1G,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 7]","Give Kelly Reichardt (director) and Jonathan Raymond (writer) due credit. They may have created a failure in Meek's Cutoff, but it's a failure that is serious, thoughtful and encourages discussion.In 1845 three couples hire a guide to lead them through what is supposed to be a shortcut through the Oregon high desert to good homesteading land. Before long, exhausted, dirty and running short of water, Soloman and Emily Tetherow (Will Patton, Michelle Williams), William and Glory White (Neal Huff, Shirley Henderson) and their young son, and Thomas and Millie Gately (Paul Dano, Zoe Kazan) realize their guide, Stephen Meek (Bruce Davidson) is just as lost as they are.They push on because they have little alternative. They must cross rivers, struggle over sun-parched flatland, depend on what brush there is to feed the oxen that pull their three wagons, and listen to the blustery tales of Meek when they can finally settle for the night. The men discuss what to do while the women try to listen. The men capture a lone Indian (Rod Rondeaux) who might lead them to water or might kill them. The men debate killing the Indian then and there. Meek in particular is in favor of this. One of the women, Emily Tetherow, speaks up and insists that the possibly of water is more important than anything else.Now we see a subtle change as the balance of authority moves toward the women, especially Emily. They face life and death options...do they continue, do they turn back; do they move north, or south or west, do they treat the Indian as a savage or as a possible savior. Meek's Cutoff ends as it began, with the settlers and Meek taking the only real option open to them...to just keep going.The look of the movie is faded and dry. There is little dialogue. The mountains and desert are well photographed but slowly become claustrophobic. The world has become just these settlers, Meek, the Indian and the three wagons and the dwindling supplies. The men lead the oxen and the women trudge behind the wagons. They are all lost, and dying is one of the options facing them.A good deal of effort was taken to be authentic, from the faded, long dresses and deep, shadowed bonnets of the women to the guttering lamps at night. And the nights are black and dense. Meek, all bluster and full of bragging stories, is a creature of filthy buckskins and a lot of hair. The women's hands are dark with grime.Why do I think Meek's Cutoff is a failure? We observe this small band of humanity rather than feel connected to it. The long takes and lack of dialogue is tiring and makes for restless viewing. The ostensible options faced by them are really no options at all. They come to realize at each discussion of ""What do we do next?"" what we have long noticed: That every option is as bad or good as just doing what they're doing. The ending is a fine example of an ambiguous conclusion that is not intriguing, just unsatisfying. It's almost as if the director and the writer were telling us, ""If you don't get it, that's not our responsibility."" This attitude is especially clear with the one extra, ""The Making of Meek's Cutoff."" We're given extensive shots of wagons being built, set-ups in the desert, make-up applied and such...all without narration, explanation or logical placement of the scenes. Some scenes seem included simply because they photographed well. If a director doesn't really care if her audience understands a ""making of"" feature, why should we care about either the feature or her movie?

1444588,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00579YI1G,DanD,"[1, 2]","There's a lot going on in MEEK'S CUTOFF, despite the simple plot: a band of pilgrims across the American West search for water. The film is incredibly deep, and the actors hardly seem like they're putting out effort (in a good way): the cast, led by Michelle Williams, Will Patton, Bruce Greenwood, and Paul Dano, give organic performances rooted in the landscape around them.  And what a landscape it is; the cinematography is utterly breathtaking, capturing the bleak despair and beauty surrounding the group.The problem is, there's also a lot that's NOT going on in MEEK'S CROSSING.  Namely, action.  It's easy for your attention to wander; it shouldn't, because this a beautiful, thoughtful film, but it still does, meaning much of what the film has to offer goes unnoticed.  Kelly Reichardt's direction is somewhat lazy, yes, but that can actually be a good thing in some situations; I'm laying more of the blame on Jonathan Raymond's script, which delves deep into the gritty side of humanity, but doesn't offer much on the surface.  Still waters run deep, but rapids are much more interesting.  As such, MEEK'S CROSSING comes off as a failed experiment, though definitely worth your time and attention, if you can give it.  There's a reason this film is appearing on both Best Of AND Worst Of lists for 2011...because, oddly enough, it has the potential to be both.",3,"A beautiful, if failed, experiment to make an existential western.",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1372,"['lot', 'going', 'MEEK', 'CUTOFF', 'simple', 'plot', 'band', 'pilgrims', 'American', 'West', 'search', 'water', 'film', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'actors', 'hardly', 'seem', ""'re"", 'putting', 'out', 'effort', 'good', 'way', 'cast', 'led', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'give', 'organic', 'performances', 'rooted', 'landscape', 'what', 'landscape', 'cinematography', 'utterly', 'breathtaking', 'capturing', 'bleak', 'despair', 'beauty', 'surrounding', 'group.The', 'problem', 'also', 'lot', 'NOT', 'going', 'MEEK', 'CROSSING', 'Namely', 'action', 'easy', 'attention', 'wander', 'should', ""n't"", 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'still', 'meaning', 'much', 'what', 'film', 'offer', 'unnoticed', 'Kelly', 'Reichardt', 'direction', 'somewhat', 'lazy', 'yes', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'situations', ""'m"", 'laying', 'more', 'blame', 'Jonathan', 'Raymond', 'script', 'deep', 'gritty', 'side', 'humanity', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'surface', 'Still', 'waters', 'run', 'deep', 'rapids', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'such', 'MEEK', 'CROSSING', 'off', 'failed', 'experiment', 'definitely', 'time', 'attention', 'can', 'give', 'reason', 'film', 'appearing', 'Best', 'AND', 'Worst', 'lists', '2011', 'oddly', 'enough', 'potential', 'be']",Meek's Cutoff
1444589,A11QQCQ6P0L3B,B00579YI1G,Dan Harlow,"[0, 0]","The first &#34;rule&#34; you teach a young writer is that you should always start your story at the beginning and end it at the end. This may seem like axiomatic advice, but often young writers want to cram as much detail and back story into their work because they have not yet learned the craft of writing. However, good writing is difficult and often requires a lot of editing to pare down the text into something that actually resembles a story. Too much exposition is boring or, at least, unnecessary to the story at hand. Every detail, line of dialogue and scene must work to serve the story - anything else should be cut.The second &#34;rule&#34; young writers are confronted with is that once you know the rules you can then break them. Meek's Cutoff is a master-class in the second &#34;rule&#34;.Meek's Cutoff is set in covered wagon times in the American west (Oregon country) and follows the travails of three families, a guide named Meek and eventually a Native American from the Cayuse people. These are the facts of the film and they are not in dispute. However, we are told nothing as to how these three families came to be settlers, where they came from or even what they hope to find when they reach their destination. The film drops us into the story as the small band is already far into their journey and already lost in the vast expanse of the American west.The opening shot, and this is where writing students should take note, is that of a river or, more importantly, water. Water and the life it provides are the ultimate stakes that drive this film. Everything depends on these characters finding water be it their relationships to each other or the decisions they make in the course of the film. The premise of finding water seems straight forward enough too, however, Meek's Cutoff turns a fairly simple premise into high-art. Meek's Cutoff film mostly deals with the women of the group. The women wash the clothes, tend to the animals, collect kindling and do the cooking. The men - well, the men &#34;lead&#34; the group. Yet we do not get the point of view of the men here, we only see what the women must deal with. In fact even the dialogue of the men is muted as if we are hearing it from several yards away while the women stand back and must accept what the men decide. In fact we can barely hear the dialogue of the men most times unless they are telling stories of bravado or are complaining.For an audience this inability to even hear many of the male characters dialogue could be frustrating, but it makes sense here. By not knowing what the &#34;plan&#34; is, we are forced to see the point of view of the women and this pulls us into their plight. The women here are mostly powerless and their fate is in the hands of their husbands and, more dramatically, in Meek, a rough and untrustworthy guide. Yet the search for water changes the dynamic of the group over the course of the film and the main character, Emily Tetherow, begins making the most important decision of who to trust, Meek or a captured Cayuse Indian. Their lives all depend on this decision and all other decisions are secondary.This leads us to the end of the film. I won't give it away here, but suffice it to say that the film ends much as it begins and is the source of great confusion and controversy. Needless to say, many people will be confused or even angry with how Meek's Cutoff ends, but to end the film any other way would miss the point of the entire story. An old saying goes that water has no memory but it leaves its mark. So too do the characters of Meek's Cutoff and, more importantly, the real settlers who traveled a thousand miles across the open, untamed American west. We do not know the names of most of those settlers and their stories have been mostly forgotten, but they left their mark the way a tiny stream will one day carve a canyon.",5,Water has no memory but it leaves its mark,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,3874,"['first', '34', 'rule', '34', 'teach', 'young', 'writer', 'should', 'always', 'start', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'end', 'may', 'seem', 'axiomatic', 'advice', 'often', 'young', 'writers', 'want', 'cram', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'back', 'story', 'work', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'learned', 'craft', 'writing', 'However', 'good', 'writing', 'difficult', 'often', 'lot', 'editing', 'pare', 'down', 'text', 'something', 'actually', 'story', 'Too', 'much', 'exposition', 'boring', 'least', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'hand', 'detail', 'line', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'must', 'work', 'serve', 'story', 'anything', 'else', 'should', 'be', 'cut.The', 'second', '34', 'rule', '34', 'young', 'writers', 'are', 'confronted', 'once', 'know', 'rules', 'can', 'then', 'break', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'master-class', 'second', '34', 'rule', '34', 'Cutoff', 'set', 'covered', 'wagon', 'times', 'American', 'west', 'Oregon', 'country', 'travails', 'three', 'families', 'guide', 'named', 'Meek', 'eventually', 'Native', 'American', 'Cayuse', 'people', 'are', 'facts', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'dispute', 'However', 'are', 'told', 'nothing', 'how', 'three', 'families', 'came', 'be', 'settlers', 'where', 'came', 'even', 'what', 'hope', 'find', 'when', 'reach', 'destination', 'film', 'story', 'small', 'band', 'already', 'far', 'journey', 'already', 'lost', 'vast', 'expanse', 'American', 'west.The', 'opening', 'shot', 'where', 'writing', 'students', 'should', 'take', 'note', 'river', 'more', 'importantly', 'water', 'Water', 'life', 'are', 'ultimate', 'stakes', 'drive', 'film', 'Everything', 'characters', 'finding', 'water', 'be', 'relationships', 'other', 'decisions', 'make', 'course', 'film', 'premise', 'finding', 'water', 'straight', 'forward', 'enough', 'too', 'however', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'fairly', 'simple', 'premise', 'high-art', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'film', 'mostly', 'women', 'group', 'women', 'wash', 'clothes', 'tend', 'animals', 'collect', 'kindling', 'do', 'cooking', 'men', 'well', 'men', '34', 'lead', '34', 'group', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'point', 'view', 'men', 'here', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'women', 'must', 'deal', 'fact', 'even', 'dialogue', 'men', 'muted', 'are', 'hearing', 'several', 'yards', 'away', 'women', 'stand', 'back', 'must', 'accept', 'what', 'men', 'decide', 'fact', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'men', 'most', 'times', 'are', 'telling', 'stories', 'bravado', 'are', 'complaining.For', 'audience', 'inability', 'even', 'hear', 'many', 'male', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'could', 'be', 'frustrating', 'sense', 'here', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', '34', 'plan', '34', 'are', 'forced', 'see', 'point', 'view', 'women', 'plight', 'women', 'here', 'are', 'mostly', 'powerless', 'fate', 'hands', 'husbands', 'more', 'dramatically', 'Meek', 'rough', 'untrustworthy', 'guide', 'search', 'water', 'changes', 'dynamic', 'group', 'course', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Emily', 'Tetherow', 'making', 'most', 'important', 'decision', 'who', 'trust', 'Meek', 'captured', 'Cayuse', 'Indian', 'lives', 'depend', 'decision', 'other', 'decisions', 'are', 'secondary.This', 'end', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here', 'say', 'film', 'much', 'source', 'great', 'confusion', 'controversy', 'Needless', 'say', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'confused', 'even', 'angry', 'how', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'end', 'film', 'other', 'way', 'would', 'miss', 'point', 'entire', 'story', 'old', 'saying', 'water', 'memory', 'mark', 'So', 'too', 'do', 'characters', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'more', 'importantly', 'real', 'settlers', 'who', 'traveled', 'thousand', 'miles', 'open', 'untamed', 'American', 'west', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'names', 'most', 'settlers', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'mostly', 'forgotten', 'left', 'mark', 'way', 'tiny', 'stream', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'carve', 'canyon']",Meek's Cutoff

From the first, I found the size of the group unconvincing:  pioneers just didn't travel in such small groups - it was far too dangerous.  Caravans often had hundreds of people in them.  And men wouldn't go off leaving their womenfolk and children alone, as happened on one occasion.  The film does exploit the vastness, and stark beauty, of the landscape very successfully, but that does not make up for the shortcomings of the plot.  The muttered dialogue among the men was irritating.  Why have people talking if you can't understand half of what they are saying?  When the film ended, I thought,""Eh?  What a cop-out!  All that tension and then - nothing!""  If the film was making some sort of existential statement, it was long-winded and, to my mind, pretentious.  Following viewing ""Meek's Cutoff,"" I watched a Buck Jones' western, ""Dawn on the Great Divide,"" made in 1930's.  It is in black and white, grainy, and the sound track hisses, but, it is great!  There was excitement, action and interesting interactions between the characters.  And white men were the bad guys, not the Indians.

1444598,A3TKLTWVLB43XQ,B00579YI1G,"DukeD1989 ""Film Buff""","[4, 9]","The film opens with a shot of men slowly pulling wagons and oxen across a shallow river. Later a woman, fearful after encountering an Indian, slowly loads a musket taking minutes to fire just two shots. At one point a broken wagon axle is fixed by slowly cutting and narrowing a log only so that they can continue to walk across the open plains of the west as the sun bears down upon them, their water supplies dwindling and the threat of Native attacks growing. To guide them through it all is a ragged looking man who boasts about his past experiences while the rest of the group contemplate killing or abandoning him due to suspicions of his ignorance or evil as they continue to wonder helplessly into the unknown, lost and fearful. All these actions and observations are seen through a very subtle but meticulous lens making ""Meek's Cutoff"" a minimalistic western that is less about the journey, or its outcomes, but rather the experience, the uncertainty and the sense of distress in uncharted lands.Some of my favorite films focus less on telling a conventional or defined story but instead are simply examinations of a time and place and the people that inhabited them; ""Meek's Cutoff"" is exactly that. It transports you with its meticulous detail to setting and aesthetics, along with its slow burning and ever growing tension filled pace, to the unexplored territories of the West, where people left their homes with the dreams of making something for themselves. Many died and the passage was harsh, it was about survival and challenged even the toughest of men which is exactly what Kelly Reichardt set out to portray here. Her film is an examination of complex human issues seen through the eyes of its characters. It is a bold move by a talented director in a time in which it seems that unless there is an explosion to mesmerize the crowd or layers or obvious exposition slapping the audience across the face then people will not give something their full attention or even bother seeing it. Luckily for those of us looking for more there are still directors willing and more importantly able to dabble in the world of delicate, enigmatic and challenging film making.What might especially turn some off here, which in fact is the films most important and damn near perfect aspect, would be the ending. Though some might call it ambiguous, as it ends abruptly, the truth is the ending is already written in history. There are not many possible outcomes to their journey and one can easily assume which is bestowed upon them, but it is that acknowledgement of the unknown, the troubling sense of uncertainty of which path to take, who to trust, North or South, what will be over the next hill; these were the decisions left in the hands of those brave, downtrodden or perhaps dumb enough to risk their lives, and the lives of the ones they loved, to travel West.  It is in knowing this that makes the final shot so incredibly powerful and all too fitting for a film whose characters faced the same chances of their stories or lives being cut short as the rest marched on, thirsty, hungry and timidly into the vast unknown.On top of all this is a wonderfully eerie score and beautiful cinematography in which the narrow frame creates a further sense of claustrophobia and helplessness among the open plain. Lastly there are the fantastic performances, especially by Michelle Williams and Bruce Greenwood, all of which making it easily one of the best and definitely one of my favorite films of 2011.",5,A Minimalistic Western,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,3511,"['film', 'shot', 'men', 'slowly', 'pulling', 'wagons', 'oxen', 'shallow', 'river', 'Later', 'woman', 'fearful', 'encountering', 'Indian', 'slowly', 'musket', 'taking', 'minutes', 'fire', 'just', 'two', 'shots', 'one', 'point', 'broken', 'wagon', 'axle', 'fixed', 'slowly', 'cutting', 'narrowing', 'log', 'only', 'so', 'can', 'continue', 'walk', 'open', 'plains', 'west', 'sun', 'down', 'water', 'supplies', 'dwindling', 'threat', 'Native', 'attacks', 'growing', 'guide', 'ragged', 'looking', 'man', 'who', 'past', 'experiences', 'rest', 'group', 'contemplate', 'killing', 'abandoning', 'due', 'suspicions', 'ignorance', 'continue', 'wonder', 'helplessly', 'unknown', 'lost', 'fearful', 'actions', 'observations', 'are', 'seen', 'very', 'subtle', 'meticulous', 'lens', 'making', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'minimalistic', 'western', 'less', 'journey', 'outcomes', 'rather', 'experience', 'uncertainty', 'sense', 'distress', 'uncharted', 'lands.Some', 'favorite', 'films', 'focus', 'less', 'telling', 'conventional', 'defined', 'story', 'instead', 'are', 'simply', 'examinations', 'time', 'place', 'people', 'inhabited', 'Meek', 'Cutoff', 'exactly', 'meticulous', 'detail', 'setting', 'aesthetics', 'slow', 'burning', 'ever', 'growing', 'tension', 'filled', 'pace', 'unexplored', 'territories', 'West', 'where', 'people', 'left', 'homes', 'dreams', 'making', 'something', 'Many', 'died', 'passage', 'was', 'harsh', 'was', 'survival', 'challenged', 'even', 'toughest', 'men', 'exactly', 'what', 'Kelly', 'Reichardt', 'set', 'out', 'portray', 'here', 'film', 'examination', 'complex', 'human', 'issues', 'seen', 'eyes', 'characters', 'bold', 'move', 'talented', 'director', 'time', 'explosion', 'mesmerize', 'crowd', 'layers', 'obvious', 'exposition', 'slapping', 'audience', 'face', 'then', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'something', 'full', 'attention', 'even', 'bother', 'seeing', 'Luckily', 'looking', 'more', 'are', 'still', 'directors', 'willing', 'more', 'importantly', 'able', 'dabble', 'world', 'delicate', 'enigmatic', 'challenging', 'film', 'might', 'especially', 'turn', 'here', 'fact', 'films', 'most', 'important', 'damn', 'perfect', 'aspect', 'would', 'be', 'ending', 'might', 'call', 'ambiguous', 'abruptly', 'truth', 'ending', 'already', 'written', 'history', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'journey', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'assume', 'bestowed', 'acknowledgement', 'unknown', 'troubling', 'sense', 'uncertainty', 'path', 'take', 'who', 'trust', 'North', 'South', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'hill', 'were', 'decisions', 'left', 'hands', 'brave', 'downtrodden', 'perhaps', 'dumb', 'enough', 'risk', 'lives', 'lives', 'ones', 'loved', 'travel', 'West', 'knowing', 'final', 'shot', 'so', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'too', 'fitting', 'film', 'characters', 'faced', 'same', 'chances', 'stories', 'lives', 'being', 'cut', 'short', 'rest', 'marched', 'thirsty', 'hungry', 'timidly', 'vast', 'unknown.On', 'top', 'wonderfully', 'eerie', 'score', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'narrow', 'frame', 'further', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'helplessness', 'open', 'plain', 'Lastly', 'are', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'especially', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'making', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2011']",Meek's Cutoff

1444600,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B00579YI1G,Edmonson,"[1, 1]","""Meek's Cutoff"" (2010), directed by Kelly Reichardt, is based on the ill-fated journey of a wagon train of settlers in 1845 through the Oregon desert led by the frontier guide Stephen Meek. This slow moving, relatively plotless film, brilliantly recreates the boredom of the settler's life in the remote unexplored regions of the West. For something so mundane I was surprisingly captivated by the small details which make up this film as we see the settler's trudge through rivers and across desert, all the while watched from afar by a lone Indian who is eventually caught and kept alive with the hope that he can lead them all to water. This film isn't high theatrical drama, but it does depict the realistic drama of settlers who are lost and trying to survive in the bleakest of landscapes. In this sense the film tries to represent the realistic depiction of life on the frontier rather than representing life as entertainment for the audience. For this reason some may find this film lacking, but if one takes it for what it is then one may find value in its parched representation of a reality where lost souls saw their hopes fade.",4,Hopes fading...,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,1140,"['Meek', 'Cutoff', '2010', 'directed', 'Kelly', 'Reichardt', 'based', 'ill-fated', 'journey', 'wagon', 'train', 'settlers', '1845', 'Oregon', 'desert', 'led', 'frontier', 'guide', 'Stephen', 'Meek', 'slow', 'moving', 'relatively', 'plotless', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'boredom', 'settler', 'life', 'remote', 'unexplored', 'regions', 'West', 'something', 'so', 'mundane', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'captivated', 'small', 'details', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'see', 'settler', 'trudge', 'rivers', 'desert', 'while', 'watched', 'afar', 'lone', 'Indian', 'who', 'eventually', 'caught', 'kept', 'alive', 'hope', 'can', 'lead', 'water', 'film', ""n't"", 'high', 'theatrical', 'drama', 'depict', 'realistic', 'drama', 'settlers', 'who', 'are', 'lost', 'trying', 'survive', 'bleakest', 'landscapes', 'sense', 'film', 'tries', 'represent', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'life', 'frontier', 'rather', 'representing', 'life', 'entertainment', 'audience', 'reason', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'lacking', 'one', 'what', 'then', 'one', 'may', 'find', 'value', 'parched', 'representation', 'reality', 'where', 'lost', 'souls', 'saw', 'hopes', 'fade']",Meek's Cutoff

And it is for an hour, week or even a year but after that it will just drive you up a tree (if any can be found). And, that was the most accurate part of the movie. As far as the Meek mid-southern route that was supposedly  safer than the Northern, with it's potential encounters with the unwelcoming Native owners, it was a hot rocky, waterless region through most of central Oregon. Approximately 6"" of rain a year and no streams for a hundred miles.So how does the movie portray a settler wagon train along the southern route - poorly, and inaccurately. Some examples: Three wagons with settlers (not likely); holding hands while walking in a rocky prairie then building a fire ringed with rocks (unlikely) and after it's died down pouring sand over it so that embers don't catch the desert on fire (unlikely). Oh, and the encounter and chase down capture of a lone Native (unlikely). All of which fits with the script which seemed staged for drama and impressive visuals. Not anything close to the large number of interesting true stories that good research would have found of the wagon trains that actually struggled on that route.

I liked the conversations in complete darkness, I thought they were a really neat touch that added to the realism.  Without the use of electric lights, complete darkness is what the characters would have experienced in real life and I like the way that was brought to the screen.  It cut through the artificiality typically present in film by not making special allowances for the film viewers, like having lighting when it would normally be pitch black.In addition, the justification for the full frame aspect ratio is one of the most creative that I have ever heard.  I read somewhere, either in an interview or perhaps in the notes written on the DVD packaging, that Kelly Reichardt purposely did not use a widescreen format because she was trying to replicate for the viewer the vision restrictions imposed on the female characters in the film by the bonnets they had to wear.  The bonnets restrict the wearer's vision from side to side and create a more box-like picture, so the full frame ratio is supposed to, literally, give the viewer the impression that they are seeing the world while wearing one of those bonnets.  I also loved the ending, I love how it just ended abruptly and left the story completely unresolved.  We never find out if the characters ever find water or if their Indian guide really knows where he is going or whether he is just as lost as they are.  I love the final shot of Michelle Williams' face looking through the tree branches as she watches the Indian guide walk off into the distance, seemingly propelled by some otherworldly quality of which the other characters are ignorant.  The culture/language clash between the white settlers and the Indian guide is also very well depicted - the Indian guide does not speak English and does not appear to make very many attempts to purposefully communicate with the settlers.  He seems more interested in his own internal world than with anything the settlers are doing.  Is he crazy and/or lost or is his unusual behavior only able to be understood in the context of his Native American culture, a culture of which the settlers and likely many viewers are largely ignorant?  Interesting question to ponder.This film is definitely not your conventional western nor conventional example of any other genre, for that matter.  ""Avant-garde"" is pretty much the word here.  If you can forgive some of its flaws and embrace the full-on realism and accuracy that the director appears to be going for, you might just enjoy this film.  It starts out as a mystery, it remains a mystery throughout, and it ends as a mystery.  Definitely one to leave you thinking for a long time afterward.",4,Avant-Garde Western That's Actually Really Good,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,3511,"['really', 'interesting', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'read', 'watched', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'do', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'expecting', 'be', 'weird', 'agree', 'film', 'was', 'slow', 'dialogue', 'was', 'difficult', 'hear', 'too', 'had', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'things', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'terms', 'reflecting', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'settlers', 'time', 'period', 'depicted', 'loved', 'beauty', 'sparseness', 'scenery', 'thought', 'long', 'periods', 'silence', 'actually', 'helped', 'allow', 'viewer', 'experience', 'visual', 'aspect', 'film', 'having', 'constantly', 'listen', 'people', 'talk', 'liked', 'conversations', 'complete', 'darkness', 'thought', 'were', 'really', 'neat', 'touch', 'added', 'realism', 'use', 'electric', 'lights', 'complete', 'darkness', 'what', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'experienced', 'real', 'life', 'like', 'way', 'was', 'brought', 'screen', 'cut', 'artificiality', 'typically', 'present', 'film', 'not', 'making', 'special', 'allowances', 'film', 'viewers', 'having', 'lighting', 'when', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'pitch', 'black.In', 'addition', 'justification', 'full', 'frame', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'read', 'somewhere', 'either', 'interview', 'perhaps', 'notes', 'written', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'Kelly', 'Reichardt', 'purposely', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'widescreen', 'format', 'was', 'trying', 'replicate', 'viewer', 'vision', 'restrictions', 'imposed', 'female', 'characters', 'film', 'bonnets', 'had', 'wear', 'bonnets', 'restrict', 'wearer', 'vision', 'side', 'side', 'create', 'more', 'box-like', 'picture', 'full', 'frame', 'ratio', 'supposed', 'literally', 'give', 'viewer', 'impression', 'are', 'seeing', 'world', 'wearing', 'one', 'bonnets', 'also', 'loved', 'ending', 'love', 'how', 'just', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'left', 'story', 'completely', 'unresolved', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'characters', 'ever', 'find', 'water', 'Indian', 'guide', 'really', 'where', 'going', 'just', 'as', 'lost', 'are', 'love', 'final', 'shot', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'face', 'looking', 'tree', 'branches', 'Indian', 'guide', 'walk', 'distance', 'seemingly', 'propelled', 'otherworldly', 'quality', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'ignorant', 'culture/language', 'clash', 'white', 'settlers', 'Indian', 'guide', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'depicted', 'Indian', 'guide', 'not', 'speak', 'English', 'not', 'appear', 'make', 'very', 'many', 'attempts', 'purposefully', 'communicate', 'settlers', 'more', 'interested', 'own', 'internal', 'world', 'anything', 'settlers', 'are', 'doing', 'crazy', 'and/or', 'lost', 'unusual', 'behavior', 'only', 'able', 'be', 'understood', 'context', 'Native', 'American', 'culture', 'culture', 'settlers', 'likely', 'many', 'viewers', 'are', 'largely', 'ignorant', 'Interesting', 'question', 'ponder.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'conventional', 'western', 'conventional', 'example', 'other', 'genre', 'matter', 'Avant-garde', 'pretty', 'much', 'word', 'here', 'can', 'forgive', 'flaws', 'embrace', 'full-on', 'realism', 'accuracy', 'director', 'be', 'going', 'might', 'just', 'enjoy', 'film', 'out', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'Definitely', 'one', 'leave', 'thinking', 'long', 'time', 'afterward']",Meek's Cutoff

Yes, it is a minimalist view of the hardships of the old west and is probably somewhat like it must have been in those days, not much drama, just plenty of slog and hardship. As a documentary it has some value perhaps but most of us buy a movie to be entertained and a little education thrown in is no bad thing too. This has almost no entertainment value at all. The story line is very flat and almost nothing happens from beginning to end. They start crossing a river and end arriving at a tree where there may be some hope of digging for water. In the meantime they ill-treat a native American and argue a bit. A wagon gets wrecked going down a slope. That's it! There is only modest character development. The aspect ratio of 1.37 is justified as highlighting the miserable life of the women but some wide views of the desolate land would have probably done that better.

Critics rated this movie highly; it wasn't shown in our area so we waited patiently until we could rent the movie. We watched it on Time Warner tonight & I must admit we were disappointed. The movie moves along very slowly; however, as I watched the movie, I reminded myself that covered wagons moved slowly.Showing the blackness of night, the lonely expanse of the way West, the  thirst of the pioneers & livestock,  the dirt that doesn't get washed away from their faces, body & clothes, etc. & obstacles that  covered wagons faced, Meek's Cutoff  depicts how slow, monotonous, dangerous & physically taxing a settler's life on a wagon train was.  Many times the audio is very, very hard to hear. We had to turn our sound system up full blast & still could barely hear some of the conversations. Thank goodness for closed captioning (which at times was removed from the screen too quickly read).I didn't research the movie until after we watched it & found that it is  loosely based on an actual 1845 event. I wish the movie followed history more closely. The movie didn't make it clear to me why 3 families decided to break away from their Wagon Train to pay/follow Meek, who said he knew another way around.  Historically, I learned that 200 wagons with 1000 pioneers made the choice to break away from their wagon train. Meek was paid to lead them  along an unmarked shortcut that would hopefully bypass a rumored Indian attack.Definitely not a Western in the style  I'm accustomed to watching, Meek's Cutoff depicts life on a wagon train more realistically.  Yes,  I felt the pioneers' hardship, thirst & anxiety; yes, I felt like I was in the middle of a desert in the blackness of night; yes, I wondered what decision I would make & who would I follow, and yes, I felt the realism of not knowing when I would find life sustaining water. However, for me, the movie was too slow, had too many totally black or almost totally black scenes when only dialogue could be heard, too many walking scenes  &  many times we  barely heard the conversations & this was with our sound system turned all the way up.  And, the ending...well, it just ended.

1444616,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B00579YI1G,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[33, 43]","Meek's Cutoff is an ambitious film trapped by a budget too low to properly realize it. The film is based on an actual event that took place in 1845, although it bears little semblance to those events.The plot, here goes;Seven, count 'em, seven settlers (not including the fetus inside the pregnant lady) in three, count 'em, three wagons cross the forbidding Oregon desert trusting their lives to their incredibly hairy guide Stephan Meek (played by Bruce Greenwood). It's clear from the get-go that Meek has no clue as to where they are at, much less if they are heading in the right direction. But since any decision they make could be just as bad, they decide to keep following Cousin It...I mean, Meek until they run across one, count 'em, one Native American who may know the right way...or not.On the plus side, the framing of the landscape, the sparse dialogue, and solid acting elevates this effort above the average ""indie"" fare. Lead by the really fine Michelle Williams (who bears a strong resemblance to Renee Zellweger), the rest of the cast follow admirably, especially the aforementioned Greenwood, Shirley Henderson (best known as ""Moaning Myrtle"" from the Harry Potter series), and Rod Rondeaux who plays the Native American in such a way that we have absolutely no clue what his intentions, if any, he has.Indeed, the very subject matter of how people react in this particular type of situation is enough to generate a palatable tension as they press on into the wilderness. There is also a strong attention to the ""details"" of frontier life. The gathering of wood, the keeping of fires, the attention to the water supply that helps set the proper mood.  Speaking as a amateur historian, there was nothing terribly out-of-place about the clothes, tools, and firearms we see on the screen (the flintlocks were certainly appropriate). I do question the all-metal handles on the buckets and perhaps the general style of the woman's clothing as being more post-Civil War. But even if I'm right, such things tend to get overlooked anyway and it certainly didn't stand in the way of my enjoyment of the film.On the down side, the limited budget undercuts a great deal of that very tension. Settlers in 1845 didn't cross the street with only three wagons, much less the 1,500 miles to Oregon. But even putting that historical error aside, the party is so small that even if they had stuck to the trail and caught every break, it's almost impossible to see how they could make it. All it would take is some bad weather or running across the wrong type of folks (in effect, bandits) or sickness which would wipe them out.  So given the odds, our band of intrepid heroes is doomed from the start and the film becomes a waiting game to see what unfortunate event will eventually do them in.Also, one sub-plot of a child's discovery of gold is dropped almost as soon as it's brought up and the other characters' reaction to this claim, particularly Meek himself, is impossible to believe. Even if you're stuck out in the middle of nowhere, far from any known source of water, it would take only a few seconds on horseback for any of the characters to verify the child's story. Yet no one does a thing save for one settler who sets up a ""marker"" so flimsy that a gentle gust of wind would topple it over.  And even though there was a reported ""discovery"" of gold made during the actual event in 1845 (something that has not been verified to this day), why include such a ""non-event"" in the film itself?As for the ending, which has generated some controversy, all I can say is that it fits pretty well with what such a low budget film is capable of. So while I wasn't all that miffed, many in the theater I watched the film in were not so generous. Perhaps having invested so much, they were naturally disappointed when it didn't pay off in any direct way.

For me this has the feel of a History Channel documentary with some help from Terrence Malick.  The opening sequence goes on silently for 15 or 20 minutes or so which I have no problem with given the setting. But the film lacks a purpose other than to see the hardship of frontier life.  The plot is simple and straight forward.  Three families hire a guide named Meek (an unrecognizable Bruce Greenwood) to cross the Cascades and deliver them to 1845 Oregon.Meek says he knows a shortcut.  They get lost but encounter a lone Indian in the high desert.  Why is he alone?  We never find out.  In any case they capture him with plans to execute him for being...an Indian.  One couple believes he could lead them to water which they desperately need.  Most of the film takes the form of a conflict of moral principals with the Tetherow's on one side and Meek on the other.  The other two family's switch sides depending on the better argument.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen.  Will the Indian prevail?  Does he have compatriots in the hills? Will he lead them to water?  Will Meek kill him?  Will the Teherows kill Meek?  Will Emily Tetherow (Michelle Williams) end up with the Indian?  Alas, the PG stamp keeps it all in check.

And, if things had gone really wrong, ALL of them could have died.But people died by the thousands on the Trail, so to get the true magnitude of this, the movie MUST show the numbers!  Ten people and three wagons???  Who cares about that?  So it failed, as it must, because even the 10 people themselves know that their fate is not that important.Some non-historians here said it was &#34;realistic.&#34;  Well, that is mostly incorrect.  The director, being from the east, apparently did not know that a TON of invasive species--cheat grass, Russian Thistle, etc.--have entrenched themselves in the 170 years since the Meek trail.  She shows them in the picture--and they would NOT have been there.  Kudos to at least the fact that the movie was shot in Eastern Oregon, but she needed to find the remaining grasslands to shoot scenes that approximate more nearly what the terrain would have looked like in 1845.  And these guys would NOT have had a bird!!  It did not take long after the train left modern-dale Vale before they were in real trouble, and people started dying.  People started throwing out everything that was too heavy, to make it easier on the oxen.  They most certainly would NOT have had a bird along.  Absurd.  And the dialogue is mostly silly too.  It is at least plausible (if fictitious) that Meek might have been hired by the British to mislead 1000 immigrants....but TEN???

It is an ancient juniper limb, carved &#34;Lost 1845  Meeks&#34; with an arrow.  It is a mute but powerful testament to the suffering of that Train.

It features Rules of Engagement's Bruce Greenwood, one of Hollywood's great underutilized, and that is a fine enough reason to watch any film. But Kelly Reichardt has turned in something quite good here, impressionist and open-ended and very artfully composed, almost the diametric opposite of Wendy and Lucy, and I liked it a good deal.Plot: three families are headed to California  in 1845 along the Oregon Trail, hoping to find their fortunes in the west. Seeking a shortcut, they have hired Samuel Meek (Greenwood), a native of the area, who claims to know a shortcut through the mountains. As time goes on, however, the settlers begin to question whether Mr. Meek knows a shortcut at all--or whether he's full of hot air. After wandering the desert for days with no water, the party comes across an Indian who claims he can lead them to water--stranding the party between keeping their trust in a man who has yet to earn it and placing it instead in a man who has always been painted as the enemy of the white man.The following paragraph could be construed to have spoilers; if you are sensitive to that sort of thing, stop reading now, and just note that I am recommending you see this as long as you're a fan of the slow and arty.I mentioned, in the opening paragraph, the two things about this movie that truly struck me: the composition and the ambiguity. The composition can be seen early on; there are some incredible shots in the first ten or fifteen minutes of this movie (including a fade so perfect I actually rewound and watched it six or seven times in succession), and things just keep getting better. That shot with the three wives (Brokeback Mountain's Michelle Williams, Ruby Sparks' Zoe Kazan, and Life During Wartime's Shirley Henderson) walking in a diagonal line across the landscape? That's artistry right there. It's also blindingly artificial, so if you have a problem with pretentiousness in your movies, you probably want to run away quickly. As well, the ambiguity of the thing seems to have led more viewers to frustration than anything else; at no point in this movie do we ever know, well, anything about what's going on. Is Meek a charlatan? We never find out. Does the Indian (who is never named, a very telling point) ever actually lead the party to water? We never find out.

In fact, the movie takes all those glamorized Hollywood visions of life on the trail and tramples them into the dust. For here is life as it would actually have been lived by those 19th Century pioneers - dirty, dusty, exhausting, largely bereft of food, water, comfort and safety, exposed 24/7 to the harsh elements of nature and a succession of mortal dangers from beasts, accident and other hostile human beings.The relentless heat and sun, the parched landscape, the begrimed faces, blistered lips and leathery skin, and the growing despair of those who have set out on this journey are all captured in stark, matter-of-fact and empathetic terms by scenarist Jonathan Raymond and director Kelly Reichardt, who bring a near-documentary feel and tone to the film. While the film is loosely based on a true event that took place in 1845, the characters and plot are barely incidental to the almost palpable re-creation of the experience (an aspect that will, undoubtedly, turn many people off to the movie).Michelle Williams is probably the biggest ""name"" actor in the cast, which includes Paul Dano, Bruce Greenwood, Shirley Henderson, Neal Huff, Zoe Kazan, Tommy Nelson, and Will Patton.

He has led them astray,and they start to distrust one another(there are 3 couples in separate wagons) and their guide.Their provisions are limited and they are short of water as they journey on the Oregon Trail.They seem to be wandering aimlessly astray,He boasts about his exploits and experiences,they mutter under their hats.The revisionist western plays more emphasis on women and native Indians.Here the director Kelly Reichardt has placed the women in period bonnets and traditional clothes,stresses the daily labour and the monotony of that labour,the dry plains and the harsh conditions of the high desert,fetching wood,making fires,fetching water.The use of oxens and period wagons gives us a sense of the frontier culture. She shoots from a distance,not in close up, in 4:3 aspect ratio that turns the vast Oregon plains claustrophobic;what's emphasised is stillness, silence, unforgiving landscapes.She slows her material to a crawl and drenches her action in ambiguity, to the point that the entire affair quickly becomes engulfed in moral/ spiritual haziness.

More than any wagon-train movie I've ever seen, it is told from the point of view of the women, and unlike the vast majority of westerns that we grew up watching, it is more concerned with the small movements of survival and every-day life rather than big dramatic moments. Although the settlers are afraid of Indian attack, only one enters the picture, and he spends his time as a captive of the settlers; communication between the settlers and the Indian is never established, although the settlers hope he will lead them to water. Lack of water is the biggest threat the group faces, other than the incompetence of their guide, Meek, who steered them off the main trail to this cutoff.Several reviewers have called this film slow and avant-garde. I would call it realistic and deliberate. The tension builds and builds as the group continues to trudge along. The settlers are so small in some of the long shots that you really get a sense of how vast the land is and how difficult this crossing must have been back in 1844, when people still didn't really understand what they were getting into.

This would stop some viewers from watching the rest.The basic plot is that three families are trying to migrate somewhere and their leader has gotten them lost.  They capture a Native  American who may or may not know where there is water, which they are running out of quickly.  What becomes of them is not totally clear. The ending is ambiguous at best.It's more about mood and feeling than about action and plot.",3,Okay for those who don't want much action,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,543,"['are', 'many', 'long', 'stretches', 'movie', 'nothing', 'much', 'trekking', 'wilderness', 'totally', 'lost', 'would', 'stop', 'viewers', 'watching', 'rest.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'three', 'families', 'are', 'trying', 'migrate', 'somewhere', 'leader', 'gotten', 'lost', 'capture', 'Native', 'American', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'water', 'are', 'running', 'quickly', 'What', 'not', 'totally', 'clear', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'best.It', 'more', 'mood', 'feeling', 'action', 'plot']",Meek's Cutoff

The acting is very good and provides a very realistic feeling of how it was like in the early migration West. It is not the standard formulaic western.

Sorry, guys who usually give good advice, this one just did not resonate with me.  I like ""The Turin Horse""  which also has snail slow pace and little resolution.  I came away from that film feeling I had some insight into the lives of the father and daughter in their daily drudgery.  Meeks gave me nothing.  The actors seemed to have been plopped down on the prairie and given some dialogue so that they would have something to say in the dullest way possible.  I did not connect with the historical reality that this film was trying to duplicate.The problem for me with  this film was that I did field work in remote sections of Alaska and the lower forty eight.  The film does not come close to giving you the feeling of what it is like to be alone in a remote place with only a tent and a shotgun between you and a very dangerous world. Nor does it give you the feeling of joy you get knowing that your are absolutely alone in and untouched natural setting. It is a very different feeling from the one you get walking down a city street in a ""bad neighborhood"" at three in the morning.",1,"Makes ""The Turin Horse""  look like an action film",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1162,"['film', 'was', 'recommended', 'Filmspotting', 'very', 'positive', 'review', 'Sorry', 'guys', 'who', 'usually', 'give', 'good', 'advice', 'one', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'resonate', 'Turin', 'Horse', 'also', 'snail', 'slow', 'pace', 'little', 'resolution', 'came', 'away', 'film', 'feeling', 'had', 'insight', 'lives', 'father', 'daughter', 'daily', 'drudgery', 'Meeks', 'gave', 'nothing', 'actors', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'plopped', 'down', 'prairie', 'given', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'dullest', 'way', 'possible', 'did', 'not', 'connect', 'historical', 'reality', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'duplicate.The', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'did', 'field', 'work', 'remote', 'sections', 'Alaska', 'lower', 'forty', 'eight', 'film', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'giving', 'feeling', 'what', 'be', 'alone', 'remote', 'place', 'only', 'tent', 'shotgun', 'very', 'dangerous', 'world', 'give', 'feeling', 'joy', 'get', 'knowing', 'are', 'absolutely', 'alone', 'untouched', 'natural', 'setting', 'very', 'different', 'feeling', 'one', 'get', 'walking', 'down', 'city', 'street', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'three', 'morning']",Meek's Cutoff
