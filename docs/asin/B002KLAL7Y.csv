1274983,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002KLAL7Y,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 10]","Yeah, those are my sentiments exactly.  The thing was, I knew this was going to be one of those `gotta be in the right mood' kind of slapstick comedies in the vein of nearly everything else Jack Black has done, which means it is going to be colorful if you get my drift; the thing is, I never really expected this.  The film is colorful all right, maybe too much so.With one off-color joke after another (stuff I wouldn't even want a teenager to hear) and a slew of suggestive innuendo, `Year One' is NOT a film for the whole family.  Listen, I'm not a zealot for wholesome entertainment or anything like that, but when this kind of material serves absolutely no purpose (they aren't even funny half the time, just rather awkward and gross) then it's better off left on the cutting room floor.It kind of reminds me of the demise of Adam Sandler.So Zed is a failed hunter who is more a laughing stock to his tribe than anything else.  Oh is his only friend; a dorky gatherer who lusts after Zed's sister Eema.  When Zed eats of the forbidden fruit he is expelled and Oh follows him (sort of by necessity).  The rest of the tribe ends up forced into slavery, including Eema and Maya, the girl who Zed is crushing over, and so they decide to concoct a plan to rescue them; but they are stupid (at least Zed is) and so he pretty much fails a lot before getting it right.Michael Cera is funny.  I know that a lot of people kind of hate him now that he is everywhere, but he is really funny.  His delivery just makes everything he says hit just right, and if it weren't for him I would have turned off the movie.  In fact, even with him I came awfully close to turning it off a few times, it was that grating on my nerves.And I really wanted this to be funny...Jack Black is really an acquired taste, a taste that I have yet to fully acquire I guess.  I like him sometimes, but most times he's just obnoxious.  Parts of this film he nails, the rest he falls flat on his face.  Oliver Platt is ridiculous here, but he manages to make me laugh a few times (when he tried to curse that one guy I laughed), but for the most part he's a clich&eacute;d stereotype that is more disgusting and uncomfortable than anything else.  Juno Temple and June Diane Raphael and especially Olivia Wilde are merely here for eye candy, and they serve their purpose.Oh, and did I mention that this is one of the most sacrilegious films I've ever seen.  I mean, I understand humor and I understand religious interpretation but this film mocks scripture so much I was stunned...I loathe David Cross here.I'd skip this one unless you are such a die hard fan of Black (why would anyone be?) that you HAVE to see it.  I laughed once of twice (maybe a few more times than that, but quite of bit of it was nervous laughter) but it is not enough to ever get me to suffer through this mess again.",1,Oh my god this was awful...,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,2859,"['Yeah', 'are', 'sentiments', 'exactly', 'thing', 'was', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'right', 'mood', 'kind', 'slapstick', 'comedies', 'vein', 'nearly', 'everything', 'else', 'Jack', 'Black', 'done', 'going', 'be', 'colorful', 'get', 'drift', 'thing', 'never', 'really', 'expected', 'film', 'colorful', 'all', 'right', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'so.With', 'one', 'off-color', 'joke', 'stuff', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'teenager', 'hear', 'slew', 'suggestive', 'innuendo', 'Year', 'One', 'NOT', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'Listen', ""'m"", 'not', 'zealot', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'anything', 'when', 'kind', 'material', 'serves', 'absolutely', 'purpose', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny', 'time', 'just', 'rather', 'awkward', 'gross', 'then', 'better', 'off', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.It', 'kind', 'reminds', 'demise', 'Adam', 'Sandler.So', 'Zed', 'failed', 'hunter', 'who', 'more', 'laughing', 'stock', 'tribe', 'anything', 'else', 'Oh', 'only', 'friend', 'dorky', 'gatherer', 'who', 'Zed', 'sister', 'Eema', 'When', 'Zed', 'eats', 'forbidden', 'fruit', 'expelled', 'Oh', 'sort', 'necessity', 'rest', 'tribe', 'up', 'forced', 'slavery', 'including', 'Eema', 'Maya', 'girl', 'who', 'Zed', 'crushing', 'so', 'decide', 'concoct', 'plan', 'rescue', 'are', 'stupid', 'least', 'Zed', 'so', 'pretty', 'much', 'lot', 'getting', 'right.Michael', 'Cera', 'funny', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'kind', 'hate', 'now', 'everywhere', 'really', 'funny', 'delivery', 'just', 'everything', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'were', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'fact', 'even', 'came', 'awfully', 'close', 'turning', 'off', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'grating', 'nerves.And', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'funny', 'Jack', 'Black', 'really', 'acquired', 'taste', 'taste', 'have', 'yet', 'fully', 'acquire', 'guess', 'like', 'sometimes', 'most', 'times', 'just', 'obnoxious', 'Parts', 'film', 'rest', 'flat', 'face', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'ridiculous', 'here', 'make', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'tried', 'curse', 'one', 'guy', 'laughed', 'most', 'part', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotype', 'more', 'disgusting', 'uncomfortable', 'anything', 'else', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'June', 'Diane', 'Raphael', 'especially', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'are', 'merely', 'here', 'eye', 'candy', 'serve', 'purpose.Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'one', 'most', 'sacrilegious', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'mean', 'understand', 'humor', 'understand', 'religious', 'interpretation', 'film', 'scripture', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'stunned', 'loathe', 'David', 'Cross', 'here.I', ""'d"", 'skip', 'one', 'are', 'such', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Black', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'be', 'HAVE', 'see', 'laughed', 'once', 'twice', 'maybe', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', 'nervous', 'laughter', 'not', 'enough', 'ever', 'get', 'suffer', 'mess', 'again']",N/A

1274986,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B002KLAL7Y,Anyechka,"[3, 8]","This movie was one of the worst I've seen in awhile, and brings new meaning to the lowest common denominator.  I got a couple of laughs out of it, but this was one of those cases where all of the funny moments are pretty much covered in the trailer.  While I recognize that not all movies are supposed to be high art and understand that sometimes one just wants to have some escapist entertainment, this movie provided almost no entertainment.  It's like the writers took some Biblical characters and events, Roman history, and prehistoric days, put them in a blender, and came out with this bizarre crazy quilt of a movie.  None of the events depicted in this movie took place in the year one; for starters, the opening scenes depict a prehistoric existence of hunting, gathering, and living in huts, suggesting a movie that's set thousands of years before the year one.  Are Zed and Oh supposed to be walking through time portals after they're exiled from their village?  That would explain how they amble through Biblical and historical events from completely different time periods.  I'm all for respectfully tinkering with certain aspects of history to make characters or a story more relevant to a modern viewer, but completely changing entire characters or storylines?  Lilith is supposed to be Adam's lesbian daughter instead of his apocryphal first wife?  Abraham is having everyone circumcised after the Akedah (near-sacrifice of Isaac) instead of when Isaac was only 8 days old?  Roman characters are romping through Sodom and Gomorrah and the Middle Eastern desert?  I was half-expecting them to stumble upon Noah building his ark after leaving Sodom, at the rate they were going!I might have been able to somewhat ignore all of the liberties taken with actual history and Biblical characters if the story itself had actually been interesting and the jokes had been funny.  But the attempts at humor are geared towards 12 year olds, like Zed eating feces, Oh having urine dripping into his mouth and nose, Oh having to rub hot oil on the gross hairy chest of a high priest who looks like an overweight hairy version of Boy George, circumcision jokes, male virgin jokes, eunuch jokes, flatulence jokes, and Zed and Oh vomiting after Cain takes them for a ride in a cart with wheels.  Most of the funny moments take place in the first section of the movie, in the hunting and gathering society.  I love slapstick comedy, but this went beyond lowbrow but funny humor to just plain vulgar and tasteless.  The plot itself was pretty thin and stupid, Zed and Oh trying to get their love interests Maya and Eema out of slavery so they can all escape together.  Maybe it would've been more interesting if there hadn't been so much gross-out humor that most people don't find side-splittingly hilarious past elementary school, and if it hadn't wandered all over the place in terms of historical events and eras.I'm glad we only rented this one, and for once I agree with the one-star review my boyfriend gave the product.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Throw in actor Michael Cera, and you have yourself a pretty good film overall.Perhaps I'm just happy with the fact that Jack Black maintains his normal character compared to his other comedy roles and blends it with Michael Cera's typical character.  I recall how hilarious Michael was in Arrested Development, and I believe his performance here is quite similar. Now, like I said I'm no Jack Black fan, but taking his style and combining it with Michael Cera's really worked for me.The storyline itself (along with the source of humor) is extremely whacky, focusing on long long ago during the Biblical times (hence the name of the film) and basically making a mockery of the entire time period. I can see how some people would be offended I suppose, but for me, I'm not the least bit offended.In fact, the storyline is so outrageous that it's best to just treat the entire film as nothing more than a cheap comedy. That's all it really is anyway. Throw in some slapstick humor, and well, that just about sums it up.I just happened to find many of the segments absolutely hysterical. The two brothers beating the crap out of each other out in the field with the one rock-wielding brother not knowing when to stop, to the scene involving a potential ""private part snipping"", to the first time the two warriors experience what it's like to ride on wheels (which might honestly have some accuracy to it, you know).

Its full of biblical references, jokes about circumcision, sacrifice, and of course the city of sodom itself. Its not the funniest, cleverest movie out there but its funny nevertheless. I myself laughed a ton, but I also have read the bible and get the humor.Jack Black does his usual wide eyed, blutoesque behavior while Cera does his usual low key sarcasm and mumbling. Is it old? a bit, does it work here? Absolutely. Its worth a rent, maybe not to buy unless you are huge fans of Harold Ramis, Jack Black, or Michael Cera.*I happened to have loved Oliver Platt as the High Priest of Sodom and Hank Azaria as Abraham, they both give brilliant performances and had me laughing the hardest, I would say watch this just for them.",3,"Not so bad, if you get biblical humor.",1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,1232,"['Year', 'One', 'isnt', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'reviewers', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'movie', 'pretty', 'simple', 'two', 'primitive', 'men', 'played', 'Black', 'Cera', 'who', 'are', 'kicked', 'thier', 'village', 'leaving', 'two', 'women', 'love', 'way', 'find', 'new', 'place', 'settle', 'realize', 'thier', 'old', 'village', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'people', 'left', 'behind', 'are', 'now', 'slaves', 'meet', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'Abraham', 'Isaac', 'eventually', 'ending', 'up', 'ciy', 'Sodom', 'where', 'thier', 'friends', 'are', 'servants', 'king', 'full', 'biblical', 'references', 'jokes', 'circumcision', 'sacrifice', 'course', 'city', 'sodom', 'not', 'funniest', 'cleverest', 'movie', 'there', 'funny', 'nevertheless', 'laughed', 'ton', 'also', 'have', 'read', 'bible', 'get', 'humor.Jack', 'Black', 'usual', 'wide', 'eyed', 'blutoesque', 'behavior', 'Cera', 'usual', 'low', 'key', 'sarcasm', 'mumbling', 'old', 'bit', 'work', 'here', 'Absolutely', 'worth', 'rent', 'maybe', 'not', 'buy', 'are', 'huge', 'fans', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Michael', 'Cera', '*I', 'happened', 'have', 'loved', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'High', 'Priest', 'Sodom', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Abraham', 'give', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'had', 'laughing', 'hardest', 'would', 'say', 'watch', 'just']",N/A

1274997,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002KLAL7Y,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In June 2009, a new comedy film starring Jack Black (""King Kong"", ""Be Kind Rewind"", ""Tropic Thunder"") and Michael Cera (""Juno"", ""Superbad"", ""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"") was released in theaters with a large tie-in with the NBA Finals and also featured a commercial aired on Super Bowl XLIII.The film which was directed and and a screenplay co-written by Harold Ramis (""Ghostbusters"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Stripes"", ""Caddyshack"", ""Meatballs"") and ""The Office"" writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg.  The film would be produced by Judd Apatow (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""Pineapple Express"", ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up""), cinematography by Alar Kivilo (""The Lake House"", ""The Lookout"", ""The Ice Harvest"") and music by Theodore Shapiro (""Marley & Me"", ""Tropic Thunder"", ""Semi-Pro"").The Blu-ray release includes both the standard theatrical version and the unrated version of the film which has three more minutes of extra footage.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Year One"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and the quality provides excellent detail.  From the detail of the sand in the desert, mountains in the region, trees in the village, detail on the clothing, you name it... the picture quality for ""Year One"" is solid, not reference but still a very good looking film.  Good trace of grain and no DNR (Digital Noise Reduction).As for the audio, the audio is presented with an English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack with a Spanish 5.1 soundtrack as well.  The Blu-ray features one of the few films that were released from Sony that uses a DTS-HD MA soundtrack instead of Dolby TrueHD.  For a comedy film, audio is satisfactory.  Dialogue is clean and understandable.  For the most part, the film is front and center channel driven but the crack of thunder can be heard quite nicely throughout the channels.  But it's too bad the alternate ending was not used because that is where the majority of the action is featured in the film.  But overall, the lossless audio is fine.Subtitles are featured in English, French, English SDH, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURESYear One"" comes with the following special features (all presented in High Definition, in English stereo and Spanish and Portuguese subtitles):* Cinechat - With BD-Live, viewers can chat and watch the film at the same time.* MovieIQ - Viewers can watch the film via BD-Live and get up-to-date details on the characters, behind-the-scene factoids, music and more.* The Year One Cutting Room - With this technology, viewers can choose certain clips and make their own clips with selected music and effects and then share it with friends via BD-Live.* Audio Commentary with Harold Ramis, Jack Black and Michael Cera - A hilarious and fun commentary by Ramis and the two talent.* Alternate Ending - Sodom Destruction - (8:12) Featuring optional commentary by Director Harold Ramis and actors Jack Black and Michael Cera - A more big-budget ending featuring destruction (and humor) and the ending that should have been.  This ending was much, much better than the ending that ended up in the final cut.* Deleted Scenes: Two deleted scenes for Zed & Marlak (2:52) and Splooge (1:10)* Extended and Alternate Scenes - Ten extended and alternate scenes which include: The World is a Stone, Shaman, Zed's Speech, Cougar, Zed & Oh Camp, Dust, Lost in the Desert, Stuff to Learn, Zed's Plan and Bull's Head* Line-O-Rama - (5:08) Featuring the many improvisational takes for certain scenes.* Gag Reel (8:28) - Year One bloopers* Year One: The Journey Begins - (17:52) A behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film.  Talent working with each other, costume and set design.  Interviews with crew and cast and more.* Sodom's Got `Em - (1:50) Infomercial for why people should come to the city of Sodom.* Leeroy Jenkins: The Gates of Sodom - (2:08) A segment/joke based on Leeroy Jenkins (for the ""World of Warcraft"" fans).* Year One Trailer - (2:17) The original theatrical trailer* Previews - Upcoming Sony Home Pictures Entertainment trailersJUDGMENT CALL:""Year One"" is one of those films that Apatow or even Happy Madison film fans will enjoy.  In other words, films that are comedy-driven, not meant to be taken seriously and for the most part, films that many people tend to see as moronic, idiotic and pushing the button.For ""Year One"", I will say that for an Apatow-produced film, it was not one of the best films and truthfully, I was surprised this was written by Harold Ramis because it is definitely one of his weakest written films to date.  The funny has its humorous moments and as expected, both Black and Cera are a good pairing.  It's just that the screenplay felt a bit mediocre.The biggest surprise when watching this Blu-ray is that included is an alternate ending that features more action and although a bit more dark, it was a pretty good ending that of course, people who knows the tragic story of Sodom will understand why the alternate ending was appropriate.  The fact that they spent so much for that ending scene and didn't use it, is quite a surprise and sure, it was bleaker and humorous but I think those action sequences of destruction would have been more entertaining for viewers.  I just felt that the ending Ramis did choose keep, was to saccharine and to easy going.  In the commentary, Ramis said he chose the Obama versus the George W. Bush version.  But personally, for those familiar with the Sodom and Gomorrah storyline expect nothing but destruction of the city of Sodom in someway.But overall, for those who did enjoy this film will enjoy the fact that the Blu-ray does come with a lot of special features and that the picture quality is pretty solid.  And again, you get both the unrated and theatrical version of the films.  If anything, despite the film's shortcomings, the Blu-ray release for this film is packed with features, Sony really utilizing some of the BD-Live capabilities for this release.  So, if you did enjoy this film, you'll more than likely enjoy this Blu-ray release.",3,Blu-ray: An extra star for the Blu-ray contents and PQ.

There is an attempt to satirize and lampoon these events, such as Cain killing Abel, but the humor doesn't really work and seems a little awkward or just not funny.As one reviewer noted, it is amazing that someone could mess up a comedy about two cavemen wandering around, but they've found a way to do it.

However, the moment the cast started speaking, it was apparent this was not going to be either historically accurate, or even a far stretch in that direction.What really makes this movie is the dialogue, which is far out of the historical setting. And, going from cavemen to bible history within a long hike shows that this is strictly for laughs, and not any sort of technical accuracy.Oliver Platt is outrageous as the high priest of Sodom and Xander Berkley is great as the king. David Cross is unrecognizable with his beard, and the one I most easily recognized was Horatio Sanz.

We had the choice of watching either the theatrical or unrated editions and we opted for the latter.It's a dim-witted story of two guys getting kicked out of prehistoric tribe and wandering until they find civilization. The people they run into are a melange of early biblical characters. It's supposed to be a comedy, of course, and it's mildly humorous from here to there, with a certain amount of slapstick, low-brow puns and sight gags. OK, it's not much as a story, but I found it mildly amusing. In a lot of places, it just couldn't hold my attention, however. I'm sure the reliance on biblical religious characters and making jokes out of them is going to offend a lot of people. So be it. I was not offended and, without it, the story would simply have been moronic. Actually, even with them the story was moronic, but, relax, it's a comedy.Year One provided a humorous interlude at the end of a busy day. That was it's purpose.

Black and Cera play Zed and Oh respectively, two pre-historic losers in the Biblical era, getting in all sorts of mischief that frequently involves genital and fart jokes.  Along the way we see familiar comedic faces and Judd Apatow vets like David Cross, Paul Rudd, Hank Azaria, Bill Hader, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse; to go along with Vinnie Jones, Oliver Platt, Black's Tenacious D partner Kyle Gass, the ridiculously hot Olivia Wilde, and even Ramis himself.  As a whole, Year One delivers a decent enough amount of laughs to warrant it worth viewing, but there isn't anything here that you haven't seen here plenty of times before, and seen done better either.

From playing wrestling monk to a school music teacher, to now a caveman, he finds all that is disgusting, revolting, insinuating and vulgar in any possible situation, and puts it on screen for all to see.  His latest release, Year One, is a perfect example. Set in a condensed past of human history, Mr. Black and costar Michael Cera play two cavemen who leave their tribe and go traveling around the ancient world where they encounter numerous biblical characters in important events, such as Cain killing Abel.  The movie takes every opportunity to mock episodes from the Bible, though the comedy is cruder and less involved than the stuff used by Monty Python or other takes on the Bible.  Was there some funny scenes?  Yes, but they were few and far between as much of the movie is copied of other comedies.  A prime example are the two protagonists; a fat guy (Jack Black's character) who is bossy and a skinny guy (Michael Cera's character) who is a wimp.  This sounds awfully like the Laurel and Hardy comedies.Overall, not worth the money to buy this DVD, and a lot of TV shows are a better watch than this.

Having seen it in the theater, I thought it was a fairly fun and light-hearted experience all around.  The humor is perhaps not as broad as some prefer-but myself, I sort of enjoyed the subtleties.  These type of films usually benefit from a second or even third viewing if you give them a chance.In ""Year One"", Jack Black plays his part adequately but seems to yield the majority of the spotlight to his on-screen cohort Michael Cera.  Michael Cera is the real star of ""Year One"" and Black seems to know it-taking a step back for the younger comedic actor to really shine.  Cera's comedic delivery is dry and spot-on for his character ""Oh"" and he plays the part with real charismatic charm.  In short, it is Cera's film, not Black's-and I wouldn't have had it any other way.When it comes down to it, Year One is just a harmless little diversionary film which doesn't take itself too seriously and nor should you.  I personally thought it had a lot of wit and charm.  Perhaps it just didn't strike the majority of audiences in the same way.

1275040,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002KLAL7Y,RMurray847,"[1, 5]","If you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE with any regularity...you know that it's mostly an exercise in frustration. Usually there are a few really funny moments surrounded by 90% completely half-baked material that evokes more a feeling of embarrassment for the actors than laughter. And at the end of the 90 minute show, the feeling you're left with is ""well, THAT wasn't worth the trouble.""YEAR ONE is much like that. There are a few pretty funny bits, surrounded by a lot of painfully unfunny stuff. Even worse, I believe it is the movie that has finally convinced me that Jack Black has worn out his welcome. (And Michael Cera isn't far behind...big sigh!)Black reached his ""height"" for me with SCHOOL OF ROCK (although I liked him in ORANGE COUNTY a lot too). The movie was perfect for his skills...a manic, over-the-top rock `n' roller with a soft heart. He was immensely likeable and his energy and love of rock shone through. Since that time, his comedies have had ever decreasing returns. NACHO LIBRE only worked to the extent that you had good feelings for Black. He worked so hard, you could practically see the flop-sweat...as though the sheer force of his personality would make the film funny. BE KIND REWIND, though in some ways delightfully quirky, didn't work in the end due in large part to Black's brash tone not suiting the more laid-back nature of the film. Even in the wonderful TROPIC THUNDER, Black's performance was the least satisfactory. And all this marginal work has slowly chipped away my goodwill, until with YEAR ONE, Black exhausted it.Black plays a ""cave man"" who is a lousy hunter and yet feels the burning certainty that something greater awaits him. When he is caught eating from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good & Evil...he is banished from the tribe. Michael Cera is a gatherer (all other gatherers are women) who pines for Black's attractive younger sister...but is essentially meek and nerdy...not at all suitable for a tribe of cave men. He joins Black on his journey, and as they travel through land, they also seem to travel forward in time. They find themselves in ""biblical"" times, where they meet Cain & Abel (David Cross & Paul Rudd) and then eventually land in the city of Sodom...where Black finally finds a chance to aim for the greatness that has eluded him, when several members of his old tribe suddenly turn up as slaves (think 10,000 B.C., if by chance you endured THAT lousy movie.)So the movie is a satire of cave man movies, but more particularly of Biblical epics and the bible itself. It is not particularly mean-spirited...so the humor isn't very pointed, and the film, at least, doesn't seem ""anti-religious"" in particular.For me, the best bits included Hank Azaria as a slightly crazed Abraham, a prophet eager to carry out God's desire for his people to be circumcised. His delivery is a combination of someone like Omar Sharif and a televangelist. Other cute bits include Cera's efforts to become a living statue, Oliver Platt's outrageously ridiculous turn as the high priest of Sodom and...well, that's about it.The cast, on paper, was promising. Michael Cera, who built up what I thought was a lifetime of good will with his hilarious work on ""Arrested Development"" and in JUNO here demonstrates that too much of a good thing really is too much. His stock character was perfect for SUPERBAD, but lost some of its luster with NICK & NORAH and in YEAR ONE...most of his goodwill is gone. While he was certainly funnier than Black...it was also painfully obvious that he was pretty much coasting by simply borrowing from his familiar mannerisms and delivery. It's essential that he find something to do in the future that shakes this up, even a little bit. David Cross (also beloved from ""Arrested..."") plays the fratricidal Abel and he manages to do absolutely nothing funny. He's trying very hard, but all his bits play like the sketches that come at the VERY end of SNL, when they're just trying to fill 5 minutes before they can wave goodbye. And Paul Rudd is Cain. We know Cain won't last as long as Abel...and his scene is very short indeed. And it's a good thing, because Cain is also not remotely funny and when the end comes for Rudd, I could only imagine how relieved he must have been to be able to get out of costume and head home.This has all been directed by Harold Ramis...but I use the term loosely. Very little skill is shown. The pace and tone of the film are all over the place. He does very little with his camera work to hide the tiny budget he was working with. And the jokes are clumsy. It feels like some of Mel Brooks' later work...the comic style that once felt fresh has become old and tired. Ramis was once a great director (and can still be a funny performer...loved him in KNOCKED UP), but YEAR ONE is not a proud moment. Judd Apatow has his name marginally attached to this film...I wish he'd had the power or foresight to just pull the plug.In 1975, YEAR ONE might have gotten by as an inferior but tonally related companion to YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Now it just plays like a very long, very tired, stylistically anachronistic TV sketch.",2,Jack Black has worn out his welcome with this little stinker.,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,5126,"['watch',

The idea of ""Year One"" sounds very promising, with stars of ""The School of Rock"" and ""Superbad"" respectively, plus director of ""Groundhog Day."" Well, to me, the film is not as terrible as critics led me to think, with some funny moments here and there, though I must admit the film just mildly funny, compared with the brilliant and ingenious Bill Murray comedy.The film follows the misadventures of Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera), two prehistoric misfits who are forced to leave their community when Zed a failed hunter eats a forbidden fruit. After some ""comedic"" episodes that are based on Old Testament (Abel and Cain, for instance), Zed and Oh learn that the girls they wanted to date Maya (June Diane Raphael) and Eema (Juno Temple) are kidnapped and sold as slaves, so they head for the city of Sodom to rescue them.I know the film is not meant for Oscar. I know the unlikely duo of Zed and Oh is supposed to be silly and vulgar. What disappointed me most is that for all its silliness and vulgarity, the film is very tame. Instead of seeking inspiration for comedy in its biblical setting, the film plays it safe, relying on one-liners and toilet jokes. Michael Cera covered in his own urine? Please, he deserves much better materials.After all there is nothing new in this slapstick comedy.

All the actors in this movie are misused and embarrassed. The movie tries to clutch onto it's only crutch: Gross laughs.  Lets watch Jack Black eat feces and it will be funny.  Michael Cera will rub a man down with oil and people with love it.  NO!  It's absolutely immature and  dissapointing to see directors try to feed us cheap ""laughs"" I cannot laugh to.  There's not a funny prehistoric bone in this film, it's all undone script.  Why didn't they improv?  I know they didn't because they can all find something funnier to say than these mistakes of sentences.  I was extremely sad to see that all of this talent could come crashing down.  They put a huge whole into my collection of these actors' fine work.  I felt like I saw the horrible sequel to Date Movie with the whole movie hinting at how you just wasted your money.  The movie moves along like a toddler on crack, and I was upset to see no plot holes filled or anything explained.  The actors regret this film, and I feel sorry for them.  They were on a winning streak and now they all have dents in their record.  Harold Ramis is getting old and he needs to re-evaluate what's funny.

While this might work in an SNL skit, it should not be dragged out into a 100 minute long movie.short synopsis, the movie begins with the beginning of humankind (biblical timeline) where one cavemen (played by Jack Black) eats the forbidden fruit to obtain godlike knowledge & his sidekick ""O"" (played by Michael Cera) is compelled to follow him throughout most of the movie.Kicked out (of I guess paradise) by their tribe for having eaten the forbidden fruit, the two cavemen venture forth into the unknown stumbling from one biblical storyline to the next.There seemed little purpose in this movie except the use of satire on parts of the old testament. While I do not think the humor is that bad, I agree with most that it is not great either and without a real storyline to go by, the movie lacks any purpose or motive for one to watch it.Compare this to Monty Python's ""The Life of Brian"" and you may understand why  a storyline is so desperately needed.Unlike ""The Life of Brian"", ""Year One"" jumps from one story to the next and there is no real purpose to their adventures except at the end when it is indicated that no one person is chosen by God to lead/follow any particular belief/ritual, but that all are chosen by God to make her/his own decision as to what is right or wrong.
