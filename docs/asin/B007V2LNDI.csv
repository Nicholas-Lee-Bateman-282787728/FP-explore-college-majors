I prefer to see foreign films with sub titles. This movie is a little on the dark side and somewhat distasteful several times. Almost didn't recognise Rina T. in the movie.,3,Dubbing,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,288,"['example', 'good', 'movie', 'messed', 'up', 'English', 'dubbing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sound', 'actors', 'voice', 'prefer', 'see', 'foreign', 'films', 'sub', 'titles', 'movie', 'little', 'dark', 'side', 'somewhat', 'distasteful', 'several', 'times', 'Almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognise', 'Rina', 'T.', 'movie']",N/A
