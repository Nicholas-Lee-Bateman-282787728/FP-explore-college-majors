Now that he has passed(may Tom Laughlin RIP) I was going to watch his movie that I was planning to watch in my Instant Que on NF. When I read an article about two other Billy Jack movies I never knew existed, Born Losers and BJ goes to Washington I started searching for them and found them here on Amazon. I like watching movies and there sequels in the order they were made or are suppose to be. Anyways, when I found out this movie had to do about BillyJack fighting lawless biker dudes who wear swastikas and acting loony(and at times bisexual) I was immediately intrigued. The movie storyline and the kung fu action was evened out pretty good throughout the film. A few gripes I had was maybe they could have used a little better kind of film and some of the acting and stupid decision making by the girls,and the police being cowarrds. Other than that the film was good.",4,Better than alot of movies coming out today.,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,974,"['remember', 'watching', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'early', '80', 'how', 'anybody', 'can', 'not', 'like', 'character', 'Now', 'passed', 'may', 'Tom', 'Laughlin', 'RIP', 'was', 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'planning', 'watch', 'Instant', 'Que', 'NF', 'When', 'read', 'article', 'two', 'other', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'movies', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'Born', 'Losers', 'BJ', 'Washington', 'started', 'searching', 'found', 'here', 'Amazon', 'watching', 'movies', 'sequels', 'order', 'were', 'made', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'Anyways', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'had', 'do', 'BillyJack', 'fighting', 'lawless', 'biker', 'dudes', 'who', 'wear', 'swastikas', 'acting', 'loony', 'times', 'bisexual', 'was', 'immediately', 'intrigued', 'movie', 'storyline', 'kung', 'fu', 'action', 'was', 'evened', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'few', 'gripes', 'had', 'was', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'better', 'kind', 'film', 'acting', 'stupid', 'decision', 'making', 'girls', 'police', 'being', 'cowarrds', 'Other', 'film', 'was', 'good']",N/A

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[0, 0]","This was the start of the Billy Jack Legacy as this movie hit the theaters on August 18 1967 starring Tom Laughlin as Billy Jack, Elizabeth James as Vicky Barrington, and Jeremy Slate as Daniel Carmody. A motorcycle gang led by Daniel Danny Carmody rides through the local towns terrorizing the people and the local law is afraid of them. Enters Vicky Barrington who races to the airport to pick up her dad only to find out that she was rejected again. While the gang is riding the come across a young kid who they beat up and Billy Jack comes to his rescue. Billy is arrested along with the bikers and thrown in jail. The gang ends up raping four women who they have threaten the women into not testifying. Vicki who was raped goes under the protection of Billy Jack who has also had several altercations with the gang. The gang escalates their pressure on both Vicki and Billy Jack to keep her out of the courtroom. Some facts you may not know. This picture was banned from Sweden because of its high violence rating in 1968, 1972, and 1975. When Billy Jack and Vicky go into eat at a local restaurant they are met by an astrologer. The astrologer asks Billy when his birthday is, Billy told him August 10, and that is the real birthday of Tom Laughlin. Thoughts on the movie! I thought it was a great movie that kept my interest all the way through. You can see way Tom Laughlin did all four Billy jack pictures because he was excellent in his role as Billy Jack. Elizabeth James was excellent in her role as Vicky Barrington. She was gorgeous riding around in that white bikini on her bike.

1115599,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,B000XXWE0I,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[10, 10]","I'd bet, If you were to ask any Tom Laughlin fan what their favorite film was they'd probably say ""Billy Jack"" but for me it's always been ""Born Losers"". This is a movie about a gang of Hell's Angels running rampant in a small California town. The town's people live in complete fear of the bikers and even though the police have guns they seem afraid to step in or confront the Bikers. Tom Laughlin who plays Billy Jack is absolutely great in the role he created.Billy Jack seems easy going as he goes about minding his own business, but he just can't stand by and watch someone being victimized. Now this is the point when everything starts to explode as Billy Jack takes on the biker gang by himself. Born Losers has the goods and delivers them right up until the end. This movie was not a big Hollywood blockbuster, It was a low budget independent film and the most successful of it's time.Billy Jack fans do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of ""Born Losers"" today, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. This was the first film that the character of Billy Jack appeared in and after seeing him you won't forget him. This movie has violence and some nudity, so it's definitely not for the whole family. This is my favorite Billy Jack film and I'm glad to finally have it on DVD.Image Entertainment states that a new spectacular high-definition digital transfer for unsurpassed quality was used for this DVD release. The picture is pretty decent for the most part and better than any previous DVD version I've seen, but it still contains some noticeable scratches and debris here and there. The sound is in 5.1 Digital Dolby this time around and it sounds clear and crisp on my sound system. The film is presented in its 1.85:1 aspect ratio and enhanced for 16:9 TV's.
