It's a lot of money, but worth it for such a good movie.This is not a review the movie itself in detail here. Most people know this classic, and a lot of people have done that already. This is for the DVD. I am dissapointed they couldn't of done a commentary track, but I will forgive them since it is such a nice print of the movie.The Criterion edition is for movie lovers  and lovers of WC Fields.

Well, what did I learn from this--I learned to stay away from that man. Fields was the greatest comedian the movies ever produced. How wonderful that many of his skits from the Ziegfeld Follies and George White's Scandals were later preserved on film. Fields knew exactly what he was doing, For a great read, try the biography about Fields by James Curtis (title: W. C. Fields). The part about Fields' battle with some swans that lived on a lake near him and often came into his back yard where they would fight him off and win is almost as funny as one of Fields' skits. Even when he was given terrible writers, Fields would ad-lib his way through terrible dialogue and invent funny bits that saved several movies. His private life was tragic, but the legacy he left is priceless. This movie ties with ""It's A Gift"" as his funniest. Both are so funny that it is impossible to say one is better than the other. Strangely, ""It's A Gift"", released in 1934, was a huge money maker, and The Bank Dick, released in 1940, was a financial flop. When it was released in 1949, it faired much better.

202669,A152C8GYY25HAH,630018305X,Matthew Horner,"[7, 8]","I've seen ""The Bank Dick"" so many times, it's a little hard to review it. It's been on TV for decades and was probably one of the first movies I ever saw. I think I like it so much because it, as well as its star, W.C. Fields, is quite atypical of the Hollywood of the time [1940]. Indeed, the very fact that Fields became a star who commanded a fortune is a happy anomaly in movie history. He had a bulbous nose, he was overweight, and he is reputed to have been drunk much of the time, both on the set and off. He didn't like children or dogs. He drove the Hayes office, the self-censorship arm of the industry at the time, mad with his double entendres and with his characters who lied, cheated stole, and, worst of all, almost never paid for their sins. There are several reasons he was so successful, I think. The primary one is that he was relentlessly funny. Another is that he was always honest because, in his poking fun at everyone, he never forgot to include himself. Finally, he appealed then, as he still does today, to those who love to see hypocrisy satirized.Like all Fields movies, ""The Bank Dick"" barely has a plot at all. It simply careens from one improbably situation to the next. Fields is Egbert Souse of Lompoc, CA. He lives with his wife, mother-in-law and two daughters. They constantly henpeck and ridicule him. One day a movie company comes to town, and somehow Souse finds himself hired as the picture's director. This leads to his apprehending a bank robber, which, in turn, leads to his getting a job as a guard at the bank. Then, there is the character who comes along selling stock in a failed mine. One of the hapless buyers is souse's future son-in-law, who `borrows' the money from the bank for a few days, only to have a bank auditor show up moments later. You call this a plot? Well, forget about the story. It's all just an excuse for the wonderful physical comedy, the sharp, witty dialog, and Field's remarkable line deliveries.I should mention that Fields surrounded himself with some of the great character actors of his time. The cast of ""The Bank Dick"" includes Una Merkel, Cora Witherspoon, Frank Pangborn, Grady Sutton and Shemp Howard, who later became famous as one of the Three Stooges.",4,"W.C.

I prefer It's A Gift, but I still love this film very much.Here the family relations have completely disintegrated to the point that little Evelyn Del Rio is bouncing a ketchup bottle among other things off his head.  It's more a state of war with Fields as the crazy grandfather rather than Fields as the henpecked husband.Some of Fields's regulars are here:  Grady Sutton plays Og Oggilby (""...sounds like a bubble in a bathtub..."") who is not an imbecile but very much a ""luddie duddie.""  Russell Hicks is great as J. Frothingham Waterbury,the crooked beefstake (beefsteak?) mines stock grifter.  Shemp Howard (of the Three Stooges)plays Joe the Bartendar.  Bill Wolfe is funny just standing there in the Black Pussy Cat Cafe and being examined by Dr. Stall. Jan Duggan is funny as the mother of the little boy with the cap gun Fields attempts to apprehend. Franklin Pangborn almost steals the movie as J. Pinkerton Snoopington, bank examiner.The plot?  It's ""...improbable, impossible"" as Franklin Pangborn said in another Fields movie.  It only makes sense because Fields is in it.  It ends in a classic chase scene that even manages to include a 1930's scene out of the WPA or CCC.  But along the way we are treated to a double noggin of his rich plays on the language and his willingness to play the rascal.This was one of the movies that got frequent play in the W.C.

This man is in no way qualified for such work, but he takes the job happily. In the midst of his job, he is swindled into investing a large sum of money that he borrows from the bank into a beefsteak mine.WC Fields is a very natural and understated actor in this film, whose lines seem ad-libbed and whose comic timing is well tuned. He is a likable, clumsy drunk whose antics are obviously damaging but forgivable.This film features other film favorites. Una Merkel plays Fields' daughter, a cute, innocent character which is unlike her usual personality. Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges plays the bartender. He is frequently in the film, but his character is not developed.This comedy involves many standard devices including the slow-burn, sarcastic comments, and an overall outrageous story. The background music is sometimes a hindrance to the jokes because it cheapens them rather than emphasizing them.Overall, however, this is a cute film.",4,"""I offer you a heart handclasp!""",1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,1104,"['Bank', 'Dick', 'story', 'drunken', 'man', 'who', 'appointed', 'be', 'security', 'guard', 'bank', 'robbery', 'falsely', 'hero', 'man', 'way', 'qualified', 'such', 'work', 'job', 'happily', 'midst', 'job', 'swindled', 'investing', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'bank', 'beefsteak', 'mine.WC', 'Fields', 'very', 'natural', 'understated', 'actor', 'film', 'lines', 'seem', 'ad-libbed', 'comic', 'timing', 'well', 'tuned', 'likable', 'clumsy', 'drunk', 'antics', 'are', 'obviously', 'damaging', 'forgivable.This', 'film', 'other', 'film', 'favorites', 'Una', 'Merkel', 'Fields', 'daughter', 'cute', 'innocent', 'character', 'usual', 'personality', 'Shemp', 'Howard', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'bartender', 'frequently', 'film', 'character', 'not', 'developed.This', 'comedy', 'many', 'standard', 'devices', 'including', 'slow-burn', 'sarcastic', 'comments', 'overall', 'outrageous', 'story', 'background', 'music', 'sometimes', 'hindrance', 'jokes', 'rather', 'emphasizing', 'them.Overall', 'however', 'cute', 'film']",The Bank Dick VHS
