1413030,A2E15CAK1AWF91,B004LB5FB8,Arthur L. Warchol,"[2, 2]","-- Spoiler Alert --Actually, as a history lesson this movie is right on.  It's drama, but if there were a genre called ""Political Drama"" this movie would certainly qualify for it.It's the end of World War II, and the world had ridden itself of the Nazi threat of world enslavement, the Japanese threat of world enslavement, and the power vacuum was filled with British Imperialism on one hand and Communist plots for world domination and ultimate enslavement on the other.Caught in the middle are our protagonists Ferris, Dhana, Candace and Ng.  Ng goes off to Moscow to be indoctrinated and comes back as adversary and antagonist ready to lead his people into Communist total control (for their own good, naturally) and employs the usual methods of murder, misinformation, and terrorism to achieve his ends.Dhana seems the most conflicted of the three and can't make up her mind about who is on the side of right and who is wrong.  She grieves at the burning of an ""innocent"" village that was harboring a cache of terrorist munitions, and goes to her death in order to shield Ng (who was ruthless enough to frame this woman he ""loved"" with concealed grenades).But, wait.  In true British stoic pragmatism the authorities are willing to free Dhana from her hanging sentence if only she will give up Ng and help them find him.  I guess one could argue that the British presence was the lesser of the two evils, but then as Ng would say, this was war, and war has its casualties.  No biggie.Ultimately it's up to Ferris to bring Ng back in order to save the woman he loves, and ends up having to kill him on the way back.  But then the British official who had promised the pardon for Dhana had been himself murdered by terrorists, so there was no loss that Ng had met his deserved fate on the way back to save the woman he had framed.In the end, nobody wins.  Ferris will grieve and mourn the woman he loved until he dies.  There is no room in his heart for Candace, who had grown up from her puppy love for Ferris into a self-sacrificing woman of principle, but nevertheless was still no replacement for Dhana.Well, perhaps the country wins.  Eventually....",5,Malaya -- The Struggles of the World in Microcosm,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,2157,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Actually', 'history', 'lesson', 'movie', 'right', 'drama', 'were', 'genre', 'called', 'Political', 'Drama', 'movie', 'would', 'certainly', 'qualify', 'it.It', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'world', 'had', 'ridden', 'Nazi', 'threat', 'world', 'enslavement', 'Japanese', 'threat', 'world', 'enslavement', 'power', 'vacuum', 'was', 'filled', 'British', 'Imperialism', 'one', 'hand', 'Communist', 'plots', 'world', 'domination', 'ultimate', 'enslavement', 'other.Caught', 'middle', 'are', 'protagonists', 'Ferris', 'Dhana', 'Candace', 'Ng', 'Ng', 'Moscow', 'be', 'indoctrinated', 'back', 'adversary', 'antagonist', 'ready', 'lead', 'people', 'Communist', 'total', 'control', 'own', 'good', 'naturally', 'usual', 'methods', 'murder', 'misinformation', 'terrorism', 'achieve', 'ends.Dhana', 'most', 'conflicted', 'three', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'who', 'side', 'right', 'who', 'wrong', 'burning', 'innocent', 'village', 'was', 'harboring', 'cache', 'terrorist', 'munitions', 'death', 'order', 'shield', 'Ng', 'who', 'was', 'ruthless', 'enough', 'frame', 'woman', 'loved', 'concealed', 'grenades', '.But', 'wait', 'true', 'British', 'stoic', 'pragmatism', 'authorities', 'are', 'willing', 'free', 'Dhana', 'hanging', 'sentence', 'only', 'will', 'give', 'up', 'Ng', 'help', 'find', 'guess', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'British', 'presence', 'was', 'lesser', 'two', 'evils', 'then', 'Ng', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'war', 'war', 'casualties', 'biggie.Ultimately', 'up', 'Ferris', 'bring', 'Ng', 'back', 'order', 'save', 'woman', 'up', 'having', 'kill', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'British', 'official', 'who', 'had', 'promised', 'pardon', 'Dhana', 'had', 'been', 'murdered', 'terrorists', 'was', 'loss', 'Ng', 'had', 'met', 'deserved', 'fate', 'way', 'back', 'save', 'woman', 'had', 'framed.In', 'end', 'nobody', 'wins', 'Ferris', 'will', 'grieve', 'mourn', 'woman', 'loved', 'room', 'heart', 'Candace', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'puppy', 'love', 'Ferris', 'self-sacrificing', 'woman', 'principle', 'nevertheless', 'was', 'still', 'replacement', 'Dhana.Well', 'perhaps', 'country', 'Eventually']",N/A

1413034,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004LB5FB8,Eric Sanberg,"[5, 5]","One doesn't hear much about Maylaya's place in the scheme of things during and after WWII. This film will give you a decent taste of that wrapped up in a strong drama.Here's the scoop. Ferris (Holden), Dhana (Capucine) and Ng (Tanba) have been fighting the Japanese up to the end of the war. With the war over, Ferris buys land and goes into the rubber business. Dhana stays on as a teacher. Ng goes to Moscow and becomes indoctrinated into the ways of Communism only to return later to enforce Maylayan rebels who are trying to kick the Brits out of the country. Dhana is framed to look like a rebel. She won't rat out Ng so Ferris needs to find Ng and turn him in before the noose tightens.This is a decent story decently directed. What it has going for it is the way the characters are written and performed. Holden, and Capucine are really good. Tetsuro Tanba as Ng runs close behind. Susannah York as Candace Trumpey is Okay, but this was still a bit early in her career so she's not quite up to the others. The directing is a bit on the pedestrian side. The action/fight scenes are a bit sloppy and the talk scenes needed a bit more movement in them. The crowd scenes are typical of the time as is the musical score. Those things have gotten so much better in film over the years. Decent use is made of the location in both the villages and the wilds, but overall it's a bit leaden. It also has an interesting ending and, given this was released in 1964 it was a bit ahead of its time. Holden remarks to a British diplomat how they have learned nothing in the centuries they've spent trying to colonize other countries. The U.S. would make this same mistake a few years later in Viet Nam.This is a good solid watch.

1413041,A2BT2ZZYMU6JBQ,B004LB5FB8,"Rebecca H. Augustine ""falcargenta""","[1, 1]","""The Seventh Dawn"" was made during the early years of the Vietnam conflict.  The story is set and the movie is filmed in Malaysia, a beautiful country then and now.  The scenery alone justifies the price of the DVD.  Had this been an American film, it might have been criticized for not addressing burgeoning anti-Vietnam War sentiments and focusing on the attempts of the British Empire to peacefully ""de-imperialize.""  Instead, since this is a British production, it comes across as a self-critical analysis of how western Europeans often dealt with culture confrontation - many times honorably; often not so honorably.The story opens on an optimistic note with the ending of WW2.  The three main characters have been comrades-in-arms who anticipate a bright future.  Ferris, played by William Holden, is the owner of a rubber plantation who goes on to acquire more land to add to his ""empire.""  Capucine is cast in the role of Dhana, a beautiful Eurasian who becomes the leader of the Teachers' union.  Tetsuro Tamba portrays Ng, a guerrilla fighter who goes to Moscow to receive more education - read ""become more firmly indoctrinated.""  When he asks Dhana to go as his bride, she declines and stays with Ferris.Eight years later, Ng returns to speed up the orderly withdrawal of the British and hasten in a Marxist regime.  Since the British have subjects with interests in Malaysia, they naturally wish to de-imperialize more gradually.  Governor Trumphey, played by Michael Goodliffe, is attempting to be fair yet firm.  He grants concessions to the native Malaysians by rescinding a ban on bicycles, but then he makes an unpopular move by burning a village suspected of storing arms for the guerrilla fighters.  It doesn't help the imperialist cause when his suspicions turn out to be well-founded.Dhana, upset with British harshness, momentarily agrees to help Ng's cause.  Shortly thereafter, a search of the contents of Dhana's bicycle reveals that grenades have been secreted.  Dhana is tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death by hanging - unless she will betray Ng, which she refuses to do.Susannah York in the role of Candace Trumphey, the governor's ""vixenish"" yet idealistic daughter, believes in Dhana's innocence and throws a monkey wrench into the works by deciding to offer herself as a hostage to Ng.  Ferris sets out to find Ng in hopes of persuading him to return with him, prove Dhana's innocence, and allow the governor's daughter to go free.  He has 7 days to accomplish this task; therefore, the title, ""The Seventh Dawn.""  Heart-stopping action accompanies Ferris's quest to save both Dhana and Candace and thwart Ng's primary motive, to bring Malaysia under a Marxist regime even at the sacrifice of the innocent, including the woman he loves.The Laotian general, Kong Li, quipped, ""When two elephants fight,"" - in this case the ""elephants"" being the western versus Marxist ideals - ""it is the grass which suffers.""

The story of a struggle in Malaya between WWII-time allies for the ultimate fate of Malaysia: the country that it is or a communist dominated state.  It leaves one with an appreciation of the realities of what it took to create an independent Malaysia and a hint of why there were anti-Chinese feelings for a long time in that country.I'm glad to see it's on DVD and recommend it to anyone interested in S.E. Asian History and a step away from the classic gung-ho Viet-Nam movies about the struggles against communist domination.,5,Finally!
