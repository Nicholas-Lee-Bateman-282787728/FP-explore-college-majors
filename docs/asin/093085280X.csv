Let's face it:  human beings (including the U.S. president, corporate executives, the Freemasons, and so on) are basically stupid, and are thus incapable of conceiving and enacting vast global power conspiracies like the ones ""documented"" by this film.  That being said, ""The Obama Deception"" works astonishingly well as a portrait of our society's lunatic fringe (a fringe that seems to be drifting toward the mainstream at the speed of light).

Geha Yuja,"[7, 15]","Another revealing and compelling documentary by Alex Jones, an outspoken American patriot(after his Terror Storm DVD revealing /condemning historical state terror episodes and debunking the now discredited 911 official tale) showing how Obama and his false promise for change were sold to gullible Americans who voted him into the presidency.His promise for change turned out to be a big and blatant lie as his post election actions and appointments reflected business as usual and even worse than usual: he maintained Bush's defense secretary for a couple of years and instead of ending the Iraq and Afghan wars, he supported staying indefinitely in the first and expanding the US presence in the second. Prodded by his neocon friends/puppeteers he orchestrated (aided by the UK and France) new wars for ""democracy"" in Lybia, Egypt, Tunisia and particularly Syria a civilized and multicultural society unlike his feudal Arab Gulf allies, now torn apart!Instead of pushing for the criminal prosecution of the Wall Street fraudsters and banksters who caused the financial devastation of millions of American families whilst enriching themselves beyond belief , he brought many of those responsible directly or indirectly for the financial catastrophe to be part of his White House team. Israel's multiple lobbies have never been as powerful and domineering as they are today in Congress and within the Obama administration.In Cairo he spoke of justice and peace in the Middle East but instead has maintained Washington's unconditional support for Israeli crimes and abuses against Palestinians under occupation including relentless jewish only settlement building or expansion on stolen palestinian land. Obama 's actions have demonstrated to the world and to  an increasing number of Americans that all his campaign promises of change were fake and only intended to get him elected to the presidency of the most powerful oligarchic pseudo democracy in the world!

167086,A5UQAS0EYI85G,093085280X,cheesefilms,"[4, 16]","If you are into conspiracy theories and don't like President Obama, this film is for you. It is the conspiracy approach, whether real or imagined, that I found informative rather than the demonization of one man that, as the film admits, is just one key player in a vast secret international organization.On one hand, the film depicts Obama as a mere puppet unaware that he contributes to the tyranny or dictatorial government we all know and love, or hate, yet hold him responsible by targeting him as initiating Americas fall to facism.Whats contradicting and ironic about this documentary (and the filmmakers as well, other than using Obama as the escape goat) is the decades/centuries of silence and complacency the American people were all the way past a two-term Bush presidency and all of a sudden, for some reason, Americans have opened their eyes to an all too intrusive government, learning civics and becoming politically active when this tragic comedy began long ago. Paying taxes and banks are/were fine when it came/comes to fighting communism or the destruction and near genocide of millions of indigenous peoples before Columbus.Socialist programs and spending were/are ""okay"" when it came to displacing aboriginal peoples removals, civil rights, outlawing their religions, languages and forcibly removing native children into abusive and regimented boarding school systems.  Socialism with regard to billions for war and defense, a continued fueling and sponsoring of corrupt dictators and CIA trained terrorist, both of which we end up ""taking out"" around the globe, and yet this film paints American people as blind, sheepish victims of ""after the fact"" ignorance.The only part of this film that I find worth noting is the fleecing of taxpayers banks and corporations have been doing over time. It reflects the ongoing handling of tribal accounts today the Bureau of Indian Affairs still holds on American Indians, but on a national scale against American citizens and global stage in third world countries. Evidently, its still okay to steal from native peoples, but you'll never convince most non-natives that the theft of life, lands, freedoms and cultural authenticity of the American Indian is worthy of concern since 99% of seating presidents legislated genocide over a span of two centuries. Is this karma?There are just too many philosophical similiarities to the tea party and occupy Wallstreet movements here that right or wrong, the concerned citizens voicing dissent have corrupted both well intended revolts with racism, violence and just plain ridiculous uninformed people and no matter what your cause or concerns might be about Obama, liberals or Lady Gaga, nobody will take you serious when your followers do idiotic things.",3,Is it karma or all Obamas fault?,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,2760,"['are', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'President', 'Obama', 'film', 'conspiracy', 'approach', 'real', 'imagined', 'found', 'informative', 'rather', 'demonization', 'one', 'man', 'film', 'admits', 'just', 'one', 'key', 'player', 'vast', 'secret', 'international', 'organization.On', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'Obama', 'mere', 'puppet', 'unaware', 'tyranny', 'dictatorial', 'government', 'know', 'love', 'hate', 'yet', 'hold', 'responsible', 'targeting', 'initiating', 'Americas', 'fall', 'facism.Whats', 'contradicting', 'ironic', 'documentary', 'filmmakers', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'using', 'Obama', 'escape', 'goat', 'decades/centuries', 'silence', 'complacency', 'American', 'people', 'were', 'way', 'two-term', 'Bush', 'presidency', 'sudden', 'reason', 'Americans', 'have', 'opened', 'eyes', 'too', 'intrusive', 'government', 'learning', 'civics', 'becoming', 'politically', 'active', 'when', 'tragic', 'comedy', 'began', 'long', 'ago', 'Paying', 'taxes', 'banks', 'are/were', 'fine', 'when', 'fighting', 'communism', 'destruction', 'genocide', 'millions', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'Columbus.Socialist', 'programs', 'spending', 'were/are', 'okay', 'when', 'came', 'displacing', 'aboriginal', 'peoples', 'removals', 'civil', 'rights', 'outlawing', 'religions', 'languages', 'forcibly', 'removing', 'native', 'children', 'abusive', 'regimented', 'boarding', 'school', 'systems', 'Socialism', 'regard', 'billions', 'war', 'defense', 'continued', 'fueling', 'sponsoring', 'corrupt', 'dictators', 'CIA', 'trained', 'terrorist', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'out', 'globe', 'yet', 'film', 'paints', 'American', 'people', 'blind', 'sheepish', 'victims', 'fact', 'ignorance.The', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'find', 'worth', 'noting', 'fleecing', 'taxpayers', 'banks', 'corporations', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'time', 'ongoing', 'handling', 'tribal', 'accounts', 'today', 'Bureau', 'Indian', 'Affairs', 'still', 'American', 'Indians', 'national', 'scale', 'American', 'citizens', 'global', 'stage', 'third', 'world', 'countries', 'Evidently', 'still', 'okay', 'steal', 'native', 'peoples', ""'ll"", 'never', 'convince', 'most', 'non-natives', 'theft', 'life', 'freedoms', 'cultural', 'authenticity', 'American', 'Indian', 'worthy', 'concern', '99', '%', 'seating', 'presidents', 'legislated', 'genocide', 'span', 'two', 'centuries', 'karma', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'philosophical', 'similiarities', 'tea', 'party', 'occupy', 'Wallstreet', 'movements', 'here', 'right', 'wrong', 'concerned', 'citizens', 'voicing', 'dissent', 'have', 'corrupted', 'well', 'intended', 'revolts', 'racism', 'violence', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'uninformed', 'people', 'matter', 'what', 'cause', 'concerns', 'might', 'be', 'Obama', 'liberals', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'nobody', 'will', 'take', 'serious', 'when', 'followers', 'do', 'idiotic', 'things']",The Obama Deception: The Mask Comes Off

167091,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,093085280X,Howard M. Kindel,"[6, 15]","This documentary rightly deserves to be called Alex Jones' masterpiece.  It's far more focused than any of Jones' other works  - which is to say it's far less rambling.  It's as if Jones and his editors decided to filter out as much of the irrelevant data that usually clutters his documentaries as possible. The result is a much clearer and a much more effective presentation of his central theme: the almost complete takeover of the world's economy by the international banking establishment. So far so good: there's very little one can say to debunk that idea since it's so transparently obvious that the bankers are calling most of the shots.  However - and that's a very big ""however"" - there is a monstrously glaring omission from Jones' scenario:  Big Oil.  He barely mentions Big Oil, and when he does it's only in passing - as if the international oil cartel were merely a pawn of international banking interests. Given that the various oil companies consistently post the highest earnings in the history of business, it's a quite a stretch to accept them as little more than handmaidens of the banks. That aside, it's almost impossible to seriously question, let alone debunk, the main thrust of his presentation of the banks' enormous power: the creation of President Obama as a tool of international banking.  He insists that every president since Kennedy has also been merely a tool of big banking - and that President Kennedy was, in fact, assassinated because he was not following the bankers agenda.  Again, it's not that difficult to accept this view of the American presidency, since every modern president seems to have done everything possible to promote a corporate agenda, even at the expense of the greater social good; and, more than any other president, Obama has consistently done a 180 degree shift away from everything he pledged to do during his campaign - not just some things, which you expect, but everything.So, except for downplaying big oil's role in shaping American politics to its own interests, Jones seems to have presented an almost air-tight case for the virtual corporate takeover of the world's economy.  He should have stopped there; but, of course, being Alex Jones, he kept on until he managed to undercut his own thesis.  Two pieces of speculation almost - not quite, but almost - turned his studied and well documented presentation into a comic farce. The first involves, of all things, Social Security, which, according to Jones, was created by FDR entirely for the benefit of the bankers.  Here's how his reasoning goes: by 1933 the USA was totally bankrupt and was desperately in need of being re-financed by the international banking community.  What FDR did - wait for it! - was to put up the American people as collateral on the money he had asked the banks to loan the US government, the Social Security trust fund he set up being the mechanism for providing this bizarre ""collateral.""  A bit far-fetched, even for a man of Alex Jones' imagination; but, even so, not without a certain rationale, because it seems very clear that the banks are attempting to take over the Social Security trust fund - which, by the way is far from bankrupt and which the banks are acting as if it's rightfully theirs.  But in the final analysis, this notion of the American people being ""collateral"" must be accepted on faith.The second piece of speculation involves climate change.  Jones considers global warming to be the biggest scam in history - which would put almost all of the world's leading scientists squarely in the banks' pockets. The reason for the climate change paradigm, in his view, is to enable the enactment of a ""carbon tax"" on a worldwide level.  Once again, no compelling evidence is offered for this bombshell; we must accept it on faith - just as he insists we have been accepting the worldview promulgated by the world's bankers on nothing but faith.In the end, though as usual Alex Jones makes a very good case, he fails to make a convincing case.  As Carl Sagan had noted in his ""Cosmos"" series: if you make extraordinary claims, you must present extraordinary evidence.

It is watchable for free on Youtube as well, but if you want to support the the producer and the truth movement, and like to make copies to share, go a head an buy a copy.They interview some intelligent honest guys (Gerald Celente and Webster Tarpley for example) in this film who aren't afraid to speak the truth about what is going on.Keep in mind you will almost never hear strait truth from main stream media, because the big shots own all of the media through just a handful of corporations. Some of the commentators on Fox are the exception in that at least they bring up some of what is going on, but not usually the whole picture.The so called debunkers of this movie most likely don't even have their facts strait or they twist the meaning.

Personally I have a hard time believing that two political parties made up of thousands of people get along as well and 20+ stunt men/women.  Anyway this video said nothing and was a waist of my time.
