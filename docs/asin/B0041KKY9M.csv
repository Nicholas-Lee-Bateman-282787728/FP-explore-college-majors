1380298,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,B0041KKY9M,A customer,"[2, 3]","Director Zhang Yimou (House of Flying Daggers/HOFD) switched more than daggers for a gun in this Chinese black comedy. While HOFD was more of a martial arts love story, ""A Woman, A Gun, and A Noodleshop""(W/G/N) seems much more similar to the Korean movieThe Good, the Bad, the Weird [Blu-ray]in terms of a comedic interplay and overall vibe. Ultimately W/G/N is supposed to be a remake of the Coen Bros. film ""Blood Simple"".It takes a good five minutes or so to get into the overall feel of the movie, figuring out what it is and roughly what to expect.  Once that happens, it is a highly entertaining film that, while it misses a little here and there, is very entertaining and fun to watch. From a cinemaphotography standpoint the film is a visual feast, the characters are interesting, and while some of the plot twists and turns seem at first obvious they ultimately change on you.  The movie does not have too much to do with food, with the noodleshop serving just a backdrop to the set, but it does include an amazing noodlemaking scene near the beginning of the film before too much blood has been shed.The movie's plot centers around a mean spirited (but rich) noodleshop owner, his deservedly unhappy (but also manipulative) wife, some disgruntled employees, and some corrupt police. When the wife buys a gun for a seemingly obvious purpose, it leads everyone down a path they were not anticipating.  All three shots from the triple barreled gun are eventually fired, just not in the way the viewer is originally expecting.The most dissatisfying part of the movie was the end, which finishes a little abruptly and leaves you feeling like there could have been another 5 minutes to the film.  Not so much to answer questions, but just to put a capstone on everything and leave it feeling not so clipped.  It's possible that Yimou was just following the ending of the Coen Bros. film, but I can't say for sure since I never saw that movie.Well worth watching, the film is subtitled in English (no dubs) and other languages, and the special features are mostly a ""making of"" that is extensive but not especially entertaining. Although it is rated R, I think most people would feel this should be PG-13, or at the very least OK for 15 and up (the murders are not overly graphic/no sex). Unless you don't like subtitled movies or black comedies this is an easy and fun pickup.",4,Three shots and your out (spoilerless review),1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,2380,"['Director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers/HOFD', 'switched', 'more', 'daggers', 'gun', 'Chinese', 'black', 'comedy', 'HOFD', 'was', 'more', 'martial', 'arts', 'love', 'story', 'Woman', 'A', 'Gun', 'Noodleshop', 'W/G/N', 'much', 'more', 'similar', 'Korean', 'movieThe', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Weird', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'terms', 'comedic', 'interplay', 'overall', 'vibe', 'Ultimately', 'W/G/N', 'supposed', 'be', 'remake', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'film', 'Blood', 'Simple', '.It', 'good', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'get', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'roughly', 'what', 'expect', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'little', 'here', 'there', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'watch', 'cinemaphotography', 'standpoint', 'film', 'visual', 'feast', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'seem', 'first', 'obvious', 'ultimately', 'change', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'food', 'noodleshop', 'serving', 'just', 'backdrop', 'set', 'include', 'amazing', 'noodlemaking', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'blood', 'been', 'shed.The', 'movie', 'plot', 'centers', 'mean', 'spirited', 'rich', 'noodleshop', 'owner', 'deservedly', 'unhappy', 'also', 'manipulative', 'wife', 'disgruntled', 'employees', 'corrupt', 'police', 'When', 'wife', 'gun', 'seemingly', 'obvious', 'purpose', 'everyone', 'down', 'path', 'were', 'not', 'anticipating', 'three', 'shots', 'triple', 'barreled', 'gun', 'are', 'eventually', 'fired', 'just', 'not', 'way', 'viewer', 'originally', 'expecting.The', 'most', 'dissatisfying', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'end', 'little', 'abruptly', 'feeling', 'could', 'have', 'been', '5', 'minutes', 'film', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'answer', 'questions', 'just', 'put', 'capstone', 'everything', 'leave', 'feeling', 'not', 'so', 'clipped', 'possible', 'Yimou', 'was', 'just', 'following', 'ending', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure', 'never', 'saw', 'movie.Well', 'watching', 'film', 'subtitled', 'English', 'dubs', 'other', 'languages', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'mostly', 'making', 'extensive', 'not', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'rated', 'R', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'PG-13', 'very', 'least', 'OK', '15', 'up', 'murders', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'graphic/no', 'sex', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'subtitled', 'movies', 'black', 'comedies', 'easy', 'fun', 'pickup']",N/A
1380299,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B0041KKY9M,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[4, 4]","The miserly owner of a small-town noodle shop is stuck in a bad marriage, and though he believes his wife is out to drive him crazy, he doesn't realize she's having an affair with one of his employees. He finds out that information the same day he finds out she bought a gun. The gun part is told to him by one of his other employees, and the cheating is revealed by a stalwart police officer who isn't afraid of sharing information for a few coins. The restaurateur offers the cop a huge bounty to kill both the woman and her lover and make them disappear, but the cop double-crosses the noodle man. He kills him instead and tries to frame the wife and steal the husband's money--only the safe is locked and dead people don't always stay dead.If the plot of A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop sounds familiar, it's not just because it has many archetypical noir tropes, it's because famed Chinese director Zhang Yimou has done a full-on remake of the classic Coen Bros.' potboiler Blood Simple. The 1985 debut from the Coens was a black comedy and a modern western as much as it was a crime story, and Yimou tries to retain all of these things as he transplants the lurid tale to a remote desert outpost in 18th-century China. The story is basically the same, with a few tweaks and added elements (a secondary character is trying to rob the boss at the same time as the cop), but not all of it lines up.In Yimou's version, the noodle shop owner Wang (Ni Dahong) is fed-up with ten years of a childless marriage, and his frustrations emerge as twisted role playing and perverted abuses. His scheming wife (Yan Ni) understandably wants out, and when a band of Persian traveling salesmen come by with weapons, she buys a pistol. The gossip quickly reaches Wang, and it's all downhill from there. The narrative has a lot of twists and turns, and if you aren't familiar with the original movie, you probably won't see most of the curves coming. Even if you do know Blood Simple, Yimou still effectively establishes tension in A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop. Most of the nasty stuff happens over the course of a night, and so there is a lot of silent skulking around and plenty of near misses. There is also some good slapstick and a few moments of violence that are sure to get the blood rushing. Yimou and cinematographer Zhao Xiaoding, who also collaborated on Curse of the Golden Flower and House of Flying Daggers even try to copy some of Barry Sonnenfeld's trademark mobile tracking shots.A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop is an expertly made, elegantly crafted comedy thriller, but it's frustratingly bloodless. There's no sex, only mild violence, and none of the wickedness. I enjoyed it enough, but a meeting of such talented cinematic minds should have yielded a much more excited reaction. A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop could have been a bold reimagining or even a playful homage to Blood Simple, instead it's like being stuck at a lame party and listening to someone try to describe the movie from memory.The BluRay disc offers a fantastic transfer and about an hour and a half of making of features.Rent it first.",3,Interesting Take on a Classic,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,3123,"['miserly', 'owner', 'small-town', 'noodle', 'shop', 'stuck', 'bad', 'marriage', 'wife', 'out', 'drive', 'crazy', ""n't"", 'realize', 'having', 'affair', 'one', 'employees', 'out', 'information', 'same', 'day', 'out', 'bought', 'gun', 'gun', 'part', 'told', 'one', 'other', 'employees', 'cheating', 'revealed', 'stalwart', 'police', 'officer', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'sharing', 'information', 'few', 'coins', 'restaurateur', 'cop', 'huge', 'bounty', 'kill', 'woman', 'lover', 'make', 'disappear', 'cop', 'double-crosses', 'noodle', 'man', 'instead', 'tries', 'frame', 'wife', 'steal', 'husband', 'money', 'only', 'safe', 'locked', 'dead', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'stay', 'plot', 'A', 'Woman', 'Gun', 'Noodle', 'Shop', 'familiar', 'not', 'just', 'many', 'archetypical', 'noir', 'tropes', 'famed', 'Chinese', 'director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'done', 'full-on', 'remake', 'classic', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'potboiler', 'Blood', 'Simple', '1985', 'debut', 'Coens', 'was', 'black', 'comedy', 'modern', 'western', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'crime', 'story', 'Yimou', 'tries', 'retain', 'things', 'lurid', 'tale', 'remote', 'desert', 'outpost', '18th-century', 'China', 'story', 'basically', 'same', 'few', 'tweaks', 'added', 'elements', 'secondary', 'character', 'trying', 'rob', 'boss', 'same', 'time', 'cop', 'not', 'lines', 'up.In', 'Yimou', 'version', 'noodle', 'shop', 'owner', 'Wang', 'Ni', 'Dahong', 'fed-up', 'ten', 'years', 'childless', 'marriage', 'frustrations', 'emerge', 'twisted', 'role', 'playing', 'perverted', 'abuses', 'scheming', 'wife', 'Yan', 'Ni', 'understandably', 'out', 'when', 'band', 'Persian', 'traveling', 'salesmen', 'come', 'weapons', 'pistol', 'gossip', 'quickly', 'Wang', 'downhill', 'there', 'narrative', 'lot', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'original', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'most', 'curves', 'coming', 'Even', 'do', 'know', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'Yimou', 'still', 'effectively', 'tension', 'A', 'Woman', 'Gun', 'Noodle', 'Shop', 'Most', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'course', 'night', 'so', 'lot', 'silent', 'skulking', 'around', 'plenty', 'near', 'misses', 'also', 'good', 'slapstick', 'few', 'moments', 'violence', 'are', 'sure', 'get', 'blood', 'rushing', 'Yimou', 'cinematographer', 'Zhao', 'Xiaoding', 'who', 'also', 'collaborated', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'even', 'try', 'copy', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'trademark', 'mobile', 'tracking', 'shots.A', 'Woman', 'Gun', 'Noodle', 'Shop', 'expertly', 'made', 'elegantly', 'crafted', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'frustratingly', 'bloodless', 'sex', 'only', 'mild', 'violence', 'none', 'wickedness', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'meeting', 'such', 'talented', 'cinematic', 'minds', 'should', 'have', 'yielded', 'much', 'more', 'excited', 'reaction', 'Woman', 'Gun', 'Noodle', 'Shop', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bold', 'reimagining', 'even', 'playful', 'homage', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'instead', 'being', 'stuck', 'lame', 'party', 'listening', 'someone', 'try', 'describe', 'movie', 'memory.The', 'BluRay', 'disc', 'fantastic', 'transfer', 'hour', 'half', 'making', 'features.Rent', 'first']",N/A
1380300,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B0041KKY9M,C.Wallace,"[20, 21]","This is a Chinese film (English subtitles) based on the 1984 Coen brothers' production of Blood Simple. I think both films are excellent and would be hard pressed to rank one above the other.The basic story: Cheaters are discovered. Cuckolded husband is most unhappy and makes plans. Plans veer off course. People get . . . injured.The eighties version was set in present-day Texas. The 2010 production is set in a small noodle shop surrounded by a desolate lunar-like desert region. The shots involving this landscape are somewhat surreal and often spectacular. The time may be the 1700's or 1800's; it's when guns were still a novelty in remote parts of China, and people rode their mustangs instead of driving their Mustangs. Time and place are significant factors in the Chinese movie; they are virtually irrelevant in the Coen brothers' film.Director Zhang Yimou's version definitely has more comedy than the original. There's scarcely a giggle in the dark eighties tale. Related to this, a fundamental difference between the films is the portrayal of the wife's boyfriend. Actor John Getz's Ray is far more believable than Xiao Shenyang's Li. Li emerges as a strangely innocent buffoon. He provides a big part of the comic relief that is lacking in the original. There are also two helpers in the noodle shop who generate grins.Yan Ni, portraying the Chinese cheating wife, brings a lot more passion to the film than Frances McDormand brought to the original. Sun Honglei is great as the ruthless and greedy police officer, Zhang. M. Emmet Walsh was also great as the slimy, slovenly detective, Loren Visser, who, like Zhang, equates infidelity with opportunity.You don't have to see the original film to enjoy the recent production. But I did find it most entertaining to compare the two.",5,Bloody Noodles,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,1795,"['Chinese', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'based', '1984', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'production', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'think', 'films', 'are', 'excellent', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'rank', 'one', 'other.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Cheaters', 'are', 'discovered', 'Cuckolded', 'husband', 'most', 'unhappy', 'plans', 'Plans', 'veer', 'course', 'People', 'get', 'injured.The', 'eighties', 'version', 'was', 'set', 'present-day', 'Texas', '2010', 'production', 'set', 'small', 'noodle', 'shop', 'surrounded', 'desolate', 'lunar-like', 'desert', 'region', 'shots', 'involving', 'landscape', 'are', 'somewhat', 'surreal', 'often', 'spectacular', 'time', 'may', 'be', '1700', '1800', 'when', 'guns', 'were', 'still', 'novelty', 'remote', 'parts', 'China', 'people', 'rode', 'mustangs', 'instead', 'driving', 'Mustangs', 'Time', 'place', 'are', 'significant', 'factors', 'Chinese', 'movie', 'are', 'virtually', 'irrelevant', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film.Director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'version', 'definitely', 'more', 'comedy', 'original', 'scarcely', 'giggle', 'dark', 'eighties', 'tale', 'Related', 'fundamental', 'difference', 'films', 'portrayal', 'wife', 'boyfriend', 'Actor', 'John', 'Getz', 'Ray', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'Xiao', 'Shenyang', 'Li', 'Li', 'strangely', 'innocent', 'buffoon', 'big', 'part', 'comic', 'relief', 'lacking', 'original', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'helpers', 'noodle', 'shop', 'who', 'generate', 'grins.Yan', 'Ni', 'portraying', 'Chinese', 'cheating', 'wife', 'lot', 'more', 'passion', 'film', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'brought', 'original', 'Sun', 'Honglei', 'great', 'ruthless', 'greedy', 'police', 'officer', 'Zhang', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'slimy', 'slovenly', 'detective', 'Loren', 'Visser', 'who', 'Zhang', 'infidelity', 'opportunity.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'original', 'film', 'enjoy', 'recent', 'production', 'did', 'find', 'most', 'entertaining', 'compare', 'two']",N/A

1380302,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0041KKY9M,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 6]","Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou is known for his epic films such as ""Hero"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" and he also happens to be a fan of the Coen Brothers 1985 film ""Blood Simple"".  So, as a departure of the kind of films that Zhang is known for, a Chinese (loosely-based) adaptation of the film was created and ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" was born.Shot in Northwest China at the Gansu province, ""A Simple Noodle Story"" is a mixture of a dark thriller but also comedy.  Praised for its visual look and vibrant colors (as Zhang Yimou was praised for his use of colors in ""Hero""), ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" was nominated for a Golden Bear when the film had its international premiere at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.VIDEO:""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" is presented in 1080 High Definition (2:40:1).When Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" was released, the film caught everyone by surprise by its use of color and the overall vibrant colors were a magnificent accomplishment by cinematographer Chris Doyle.  And since then, every production, may it be for the Beijing Olympics, Chinese New Year or any film that Zhang Yimou has taken part in has embraced color.This time around, Zhang Yimou collaborates with his cinematographer Xiaoding Zhao, who he worked with previously in ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" and once again, color use in this film is magnificent.For one, the characters are wearing colors that pop.  Wang's wife in green, Li in pink, Zhao in orange and Chen in blue.  The background of where the film is shot is very close to these hills that are red and earthtone amber colors and those colors absolutely pop!Also, what I found amazing is the detail.  The details of the hills and mountain around the area, to the wood-based design of the noodleshop.  But you can also see the detail of the clothing and fabric.  The curvature of the police uniform that Zhang is wearing and everything is so detailed, that I found it to be amazing in HD.  And typically when you get these colors, you expect to see some banding and I didn't see any banding at all.  Nor did I see any crush, especially during the scenes with Wang (who tends to stay in the dark in the cellar).  Blacks are nice and deep, I didn't notice any artifacts or edge enhancement.""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" looks amazing in HD!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Similar to the picture quality, ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" has its moments where the lossless audio track really catches your attention.  Presented in Chinese Mandarin 5.1 DTS-HD MA, from the opening scenes with the cannonball being blasted or when a gun is being shot.  But where you will hear awesome audio is when the noodle shop is working and you can hear the flames through the surround channels, also the ambiance of the police men inside the restaurant or when they are traveling and you can hear the whirl from a fan that they are carrying.While the majority of the film is dialogue and music-driven and a lot of it through the front and center channels, you do get enough of noise coming through the surround channels as well and it's well-utilized throughout the film.  Even for little things such as Li's clumsiness as he keeps tripping, Zhang firing off arrows or hearing him unsheat his sword or trying to break into the safe, these moments really come alive as if it is happening right near you in real-time.So, overall, the lossless audio soundtrack is amazing.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" comes with the following special features:* Creating A Woman, A Gun and a Noodleshop - (1:59:14) Presented in standard definition, this featurette actually comprises of probably close to two dozen mini-featurettes.  This special feature goes through so many elements of what took place behind-the-scenes of the film and also featuring mini-featurettes focused on the director and the six major talents of the film.  From covering the costume design, casting, what the talent like to do during the off-time, singing, learning dance moves, stunt coordination and also giving us an idea of a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"".  But also to showcase how busy a director Zhang Yimou is because while he was working on this film, he was also working on a Chinese New Year event.* Theatrical Trailer - (1:55) The original theatrical trailer to ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"".JUDGMENT CALL:Absolutely enjoyable, fun and a bit twisted... ""A Women, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" was a pleasant surprise!If anything, Zhang Yimou is a fantastic filmmaker.  He knows what he wants, he has been able to create these visually fantastic films and also epic Chinese films but ""A Women, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" is a big surprise.  For one, I never expected to see Zhang take on a Coen Brothers film and do a loose adaptation of it.  And because of the departure from his previous films, many see this film as a way for the director to try something experimental, crazy but also a homage to the Coen Brother's 1984 debut classic but done in a Chinese way, using impressive and visually appealing colors.I have to admit, I'm still surprise by how he was able to take the storyline of the Coen Brothers' ""Blood Simple"" and transform this film to a Chinese period film.As mentioned, ""A Women, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" relies heavily on visuals, physical comedy, even the use of gags that may have been seen in '70s and '80s Chinese comedy/period films, these are not the type of films that Zhang Yimou is known for.  But he is able to craft this film, using ""Blood Simple"" as a blueprint and having fun with the storyline.  And to see this balance of comedy, vibrant colors to moments of dark twisted planning, with wonderful cinematography, beautiful costume design and also impressive set design as everything is shot with these breathtaking red/amber-colored hills and blue sky, this movie was not only artistic, creative and fun, it's another great film among the many awesome films in Zhang Yimou's oeuvre.  It's literally a work of art!And typically with many Chinese period films, there are so many characters and special effects that at times, the storyline can get convoluted or even derivative of past Chinese films but this time, the story is kept simple within six characters.  The visual storytelling and how each of these characters are displayed was quite fascinating.The performance by Honglei Sun as the police detective Zhang turned crooked and literally a murderer, was quite interesting and there is this sinister feeling that among the five other characters of this film, this lighthearted comedy was going to quickly change to a sinister, dark and twisted drama of who will be the last person standing?Actress Ni Yan does a wonderful job playing Wang's wife.  Submissive to him but also strong-willed in front of the employees, this is a woman who has been hurt so much by her husband that she seems to be staying because of the financial convenience.  The only person keeping her sane is the employee Li who has become like a good, listening friend for her.  Mischievous, playful but also a woman trying to find her inner strength.The comedian Xiao Shen-Yang does a wonderful job playing the paranoid Li.  A man who knows between right and wrong but yet feels sorry for his boss's wife and thus has her interests in mind, despite trying to keep his job at the noodle shop.  Li does his own stunts but just captures the look and feel of a paranoid man quite well!Dahong Ni as Wang is the elder man who is jealous that his wife is having an affair behind his back and now wants her gone.  Dahong Ni does a great job of playing the rich man who has power because of money and knowing he has control over his wife which he bought and over his employees.As for Ye Cheng as Zhao and Mao Mao as Chen, these characters are almost like characters that seem quite common when you watch a Shaw Bros. film.  But this time in a Zhang Yimou film.  Zhao is not very bright and has the big overbite, while Chen is the good friend of Zhao, who just works at the noodle shop and wants to keep out of trouble.The Blu-ray release is magnificent and once again, Sony Pictures Classics gives us an incredible visual film that definitely stands out amongst Zhang Yimou's previous, magnificent work.  The special features has plenty of mini-featurettes and about two hours worth of material on the making of the film and also showing us how life is quite busy for the world renown director.Overall, ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" was a fantastic film and also a refreshing escape from the kind of film that we are used to seeing from Zhang Yimou.  I'm not sure if I would qualify this film as being a masterpiece because of it's crazy use of comedy at times, but still, it was an impressive film that I can see myself coming back to quite often.Entertaining, fun, twisted and beautiful... ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"" may be loosely-based on the Coen Brothers ""Blood Simple"" but Zhang Yimou creates a different but yet fantastic film all on his own. Visually impressive, fantastic cinematography... this film is definitely recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: Absolutely enjoyable, fun and a bit twisted...

1380303,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0041KKY9M,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 5]","A WOMAN, A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP (2009, dir. Zhang Yimou, U.S.A. release 2010) is one of the most delightful, weird and suspenseful arthouse type films I have ever seen. It was laugh-out-loud hilarious yet it had a combined air of Hitchcock and Kurosawa. A remake of the Coen Brothers' first film, BLOOD SIMPLE (1984), NOODLE SHOP got the ancient Chinese treatment, and I've never seen Chinese actors excel like this since they did CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON.Set someplace in the Taklimakan Desert in China, along the Silk Route, set around the late 1700s, this is a tale of four young innocents and a nasty, bitter old miser. Wang, the old miser with the fortress-like little mini-village all his own along the Silk Road, keeps almost as a prisoner his young wife of ten years. She is nearly insane with boredom and the desire to flee old Wang. But she is trapped.In a hilarious rickety train wreck of a story, the restaurant employees (a chubby simple fellow, another young woman, and the rather gay best friend to Mrs. Wang) entertain a group of Persians. The leader (an incredibly goofy Julien Gaudfroy), dressed a bit like a colorful Captain Jack Sparrow, sells Mrs. Wang a pistol. The most powerful weapon in the world, and the sales pitch, haggling and general dialogue is some of the best I've seen. They try to sell her a 6"" gun (meaning a typical ship's cannon) and the crazy Persian fires it into the distant desert to show it off.""I'll just stick with the gun"" Mrs. Wang says dryly. The cannon fire brings along a Monty Python detachment of Imperial police, their leader one of the funniest performers I have ever watched. I called him ""Officer Cookie Monster"" because of his Muppet-like demeanor and his goggly crossed eyes. Absolutely fall-down-on-the-floor. It is his 'best detective' who will play a role in this sad, evil story of four innocent people, an idiot paranoid old miser, a robotic Imperial police officer and a murder scheme.I will not spoil it further: I have this feeling no one has really seen this film in America. All I can tell you is it is much better than a typical martial arts film - and this one aside from its bit of violence has no martial arts. Never have I seen a Chinese movie so compelling and fun without martial arts or Shao Lin Temple involved.However, since a lot has been made over the noodle dish that is cooked for the police officers, I can say it is a type of Chinese noodle soup known as ho fun, (and no, I am not joking). This hot-n-sizzle soup is made with wide, flat rice noodles and is as good as it looks in this film. And all the employees except Mrs. Wang display their kung fu when preparing the noodle dough - it makes the cowardly goofiness of their characters all the more tragic.One additional item: Mrs. Wang does not have a 'lover'. The young gay boy she relies on for friendship and comfort is nothing more than that, though they have plans to escape and get married. The first time you get a gander at this young man, you will wonder how he could possibly be anyone's ""lover"".But a lack of proper and deserved hype ruins a film's chances here quicker than the speed of light. This film opened in the U.S. on 5 September, 2010, on 5 screens and pulled in a measly $35,000. In its general release that December, it grossed $190,666. Barely enough to cover Mitt Romney's weekend expenses. Sad, sad, sad.Shot ... I really do not know where they shot this, its canvas is a gorgeous, Grand Canyon background complete with zebra stripes across the mountains. It gives a deep feeling of really being in that time and place. The Silk Route has been a special area of study for me for over 20 years. This is the first time I've ever seen a movie set on the actual Route.You cannot afford to miss this film. Though it has gaps that you will never understand, it is so funny and riveting you won't care. Get the DVD, as it will be one of the better additions to your collection!",5,"WANG'S SILK ROAD NOODLE SHOP - LAST SHOP FOR 2,000 MILES",1308528000,"06 20, 2011",2011,3941,"['WOMAN', 'A', 'GUN', 'A', 'NOODLE', 'SHOP', '2009', 'dir', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'U.S.A.', 'release', '2010', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'weird', 'suspenseful', 'arthouse', 'type', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'had', 'combined', 'air', 'Hitchcock', 'Kurosawa', 'A', 'remake', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'first', 'film', 'BLOOD', 'SIMPLE', '1984', 'NOODLE', 'SHOP', 'got', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'treatment', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'excel', 'did', 'CROUCHING', 'TIGER', 'HIDDEN', 'DRAGON.Set', 'someplace', 'Taklimakan', 'Desert', 'China', 'Silk', 'Route', 'set', 'late', '1700s', 'tale', 'four', 'young', 'innocents', 'nasty', 'bitter', 'old', 'miser', 'Wang', 'old', 'miser', 'fortress-like', 'little', 'mini-village', 'own', 'Silk', 'Road', 'almost', 'prisoner', 'young', 'wife', 'ten', 'years', 'nearly', 'insane', 'boredom', 'desire', 'flee', 'old', 'Wang', 'trapped.In', 'hilarious', 'rickety', 'train', 'wreck', 'story', 'restaurant', 'employees', 'chubby', 'simple', 'fellow', 'young', 'woman', 'rather', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'Mrs.', 'Wang', 'entertain', 'group', 'Persians', 'leader', 'incredibly', 'goofy', 'Julien', 'Gaudfroy', 'dressed', 'bit', 'colorful', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Mrs.', 'Wang', 'pistol', 'most', 'powerful', 'weapon', 'world', 'sales', 'pitch', 'haggling', 'general', 'dialogue', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'try', 'sell', '6', 'gun', 'meaning', 'typical', 'ship', 'cannon', 'crazy', 'Persian', 'fires', 'distant', 'desert', 'show', 'off', ""'ll"", 'just', 'stick', 'gun', 'Mrs.', 'Wang', 'dryly', 'cannon', 'fire', 'Monty', 'Python', 'detachment', 'Imperial', 'police', 'leader', 'one', 'funniest', 'performers', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'called', 'Officer', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'Muppet-like', 'demeanor', 'goggly', 'crossed', 'eyes', 'Absolutely', 'fall-down-on-the-floor', ""'best"", 'detective', 'who', 'will', 'play', 'role', 'sad', 'evil', 'story', 'four', 'innocent', 'people', 'idiot', 'paranoid', 'old', 'miser', 'robotic', 'Imperial', 'police', 'officer', 'murder', 'scheme.I', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'further', 'have', 'feeling', 'one', 'really', 'seen', 'film', 'America', 'can', 'tell', 'much', 'better', 'typical', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'one', 'aside', 'bit', 'violence', 'martial', 'arts', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'Chinese', 'movie', 'compelling', 'fun', 'martial', 'arts', 'Shao', 'Lin', 'Temple', 'involved.However', 'lot', 'been', 'made', 'noodle', 'dish', 'cooked', 'police', 'officers', 'can', 'say', 'type', 'Chinese', 'noodle', 'soup', 'known', 'ho', 'fun', 'am', 'not', 'joking', 'hot-n-sizzle', 'soup', 'made', 'wide', 'flat', 'rice', 'noodles', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'employees', 'Mrs.', 'Wang', 'display', 'kung', 'fu', 'when', 'preparing', 'noodle', 'cowardly', 'goofiness', 'characters', 'more', 'tragic.One', 'additional', 'item', 'Mrs.', 'Wang', 'not', 'have', ""'lover"", 'young', 'gay', 'friendship', 'comfort', 'nothing', 'more', 'have', 'plans', 'escape', 'get', 'married', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'gander', 'young', 'man', 'will', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'anyone', 'lover', 'lack', 'proper', 'deserved', 'hype', 'film', 'chances', 'here', 'quicker', 'speed', 'light', 'film', 'opened', 'U.S.', '5', 'September', '2010', '5', 'screens', 'pulled', 'measly', '35,000', 'general', 'release', 'December', 'grossed', '190,666', 'Barely', 'enough', 'cover', 'Mitt', 'Romney', 'weekend', 'expenses', 'Sad', 'sad', 'sad.Shot', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'shot', 'canvas', 'gorgeous', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'background', 'complete', 'zebra', 'stripes', 'mountains', 'deep', 'feeling', 'really', 'being', 'time', 'place', 'Silk', 'Route', 'been', 'special', 'area', 'study', '20', 'years', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'set', 'actual', 'Route.You', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'miss', 'film', 'gaps', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'so', 'funny', 'riveting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'Get', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'additions', 'collection']",N/A

The husband is ugly and monstrous.  Sun Honglei is typically excellent.  And two supporting characters are more skittish than bumbling ""Nancy Drew""-like amateur ""detectives"" simply trying to figure out what's going on, he taking the lead except when there's potential danger, at which times he graciously allows her to go first.It even includes some of Zhang Yimou's signature slow-motion techniques.Delightful (watch the supporting character in pigtails and blue) from beginning to end, and preferable to ""Blood Simple"" for those who found the tension of the latter induced not so much by on-screen events but by the tediously slow pacing.Others give (too many) details about the story.

It is a Chinese movie with subtitles and very odd characters.  The camera work showed sharp colors and beautiful desert hillsides as the sun and moon rose and set over several days of complicated actions.  I had no idea what to expect, but thought it would be a straight-forward comedy.  It turned out to be a drama and comedy full of plot twists following the owner of Chinese noodle shop and his adulterous wife.  The gun must have been just invented or brought to China.  I am guessing the time is 18th Century China.  The wife of the owner of the noodle shop buys a gun at the start of the show from a crazy character that looks like Captain Hook. He also shows her a cannon which shoots out into the desert and creates a black cloud.  The cannon shot attracts a goofy group of feudal soldiers or police who arrest women who commit adultry.  They bring four women into the noodle shop to show their shame. The owner of the Chinese noodle shop is informed by the feudal police detective that his wife is commiting adultry with a noodle shop employee.

1380309,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0041KKY9M,Mark Turner,"[5, 5]","In 1984 two film making brothers, Ethan and Joel Cohen, bust on the scene with a film called BLOOD SIMPLE. The film offered a philandering wife, a sleazy bar owner and a man who'd kill for money. Stylishly made it put the Cohen brothers on the map and led to a string of hits that culminated last year with TRUE GRIT. It also resulted in being remade in China under the name A WOMAN, A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP.The movie this time around changes not just locations but time period as well. Taking place in the not too distant past, a woman purchases a gun during the opening sequence. She is the wife of Wang, the owner of the noodle shop and a woman unhappy in her marriage. As we find out, she was purchased and nightly punished by her husband, Wang. It's little wonder she's taken up with one of his employees, Li.The movie shifts back and forth from drama to comedy depending on the circumstances and actors involved. Li comes off as a bit of a buffoon, always concerned that the boss will find out about their indiscretion and do him harm. The wife (as she is known) shows less concern and more of a plotting attitude, not planning on killing her husband but still attempting to find a way out of the marriage and into the arms of Li.As for Wang he appears to be an older man who knows his wealth buys him power. So much so that when he learns of the affair between his wife and Li, he asks a policeman/solider named Zhang to kill them both for a fee. They discuss the amount and Wang goes to his safe to retrieve the money for Zhang who sees just how much the safe holds.The culmination of these events, the purchase of the gun, the affair, the planned murder and what happens to each of these characters makes for an interesting story. But what makes the film better than most isn't just the tale but the arresting visuals used. The reddish dirt covered hills around the shop, the deep blue skies with pure white clouds, even the night time sequences all seem to pop off the screen with some amazing camera work.Director Yimou Zhang is well known for his films like RAISE THE RED LANTERN, HERO and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, each having the same sort of visual appeal. He doesn't disappoint here with some amazing things to see and experience. The colors are the brightest I've seen on film and work well, everything from the costumes to the setting.The actors all come off good as well; even through the barrier of language (the film is in Chinese with English sub titles). Keeping in mind these characters live in a time very different from our own, they each display characteristics that are original rather than simply playing them as they've been done before.On the whole I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen a film from China yet. There is a whole world of wonder to be experienced out there. Forget the washed out visuals seen in tons of poorly made kung fu films in the past, the doors have opened for something different from this country.",4,COEN CLASSIC GOES ASIAN,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,2968,"['1984', 'two', 'film', 'making', 'brothers', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'Cohen', 'bust', 'scene', 'film', 'called', 'BLOOD', 'SIMPLE', 'film', 'offered', 'philandering', 'wife', 'sleazy', 'bar', 'owner', 'man', 'who', 'kill', 'money', 'Stylishly', 'made', 'put', 'Cohen', 'brothers', 'map', 'led', 'string', 'hits', 'culminated', 'last', 'year', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'also', 'resulted', 'being', 'remade', 'China', 'name', 'A', 'WOMAN', 'A', 'GUN', 'A', 'NOODLE', 'SHOP.The', 'movie', 'time', 'around', 'changes', 'not', 'just', 'locations', 'time', 'period', 'well', 'Taking', 'place', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'past', 'woman', 'purchases', 'gun', 'opening', 'sequence', 'wife', 'Wang', 'owner', 'noodle', 'shop', 'woman', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'purchased', 'nightly', 'punished', 'husband', 'Wang', 'little', 'taken', 'up', 'one', 'employees', 'Li.The', 'movie', 'shifts', 'back', 'forth', 'drama', 'comedy', 'depending', 'circumstances', 'actors', 'involved', 'Li', 'off', 'bit', 'buffoon', 'always', 'concerned', 'boss', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'indiscretion', 'do', 'harm', 'wife', 'known', 'less', 'concern', 'more', 'plotting', 'attitude', 'not', 'planning', 'killing', 'husband', 'still', 'attempting', 'find', 'way', 'marriage', 'arms', 'Li.As', 'Wang', 'be', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'wealth', 'power', 'So', 'much', 'when', 'affair', 'wife', 'Li', 'policeman/solider', 'named', 'Zhang', 'kill', 'fee', 'discuss', 'amount', 'Wang', 'safe', 'retrieve', 'money', 'Zhang', 'who', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'safe', 'holds.The', 'culmination', 'events', 'purchase', 'gun', 'affair', 'planned', 'murder', 'what', 'characters', 'interesting', 'story', 'what', 'film', 'better', 'most', ""n't"", 'just', 'tale', 'arresting', 'visuals', 'used', 'reddish', 'dirt', 'covered', 'hills', 'shop', 'deep', 'blue', 'skies', 'pure', 'white', 'clouds', 'even', 'night', 'time', 'seem', 'pop', 'off', 'screen', 'amazing', 'camera', 'work.Director', 'Yimou', 'Zhang', 'well', 'known', 'films', 'RAISE', 'THE', 'RED', 'LANTERN', 'HERO', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'FLYING', 'DAGGERS', 'having', 'same', 'sort', 'visual', 'appeal', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'amazing', 'things', 'see', 'experience', 'colors', 'are', 'brightest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'work', 'well', 'everything', 'costumes', 'setting.The', 'actors', 'come', 'off', 'good', 'well', 'even', 'barrier', 'language', 'film', 'Chinese', 'English', 'sub', 'titles', 'Keeping', 'mind', 'characters', 'live', 'time', 'very', 'different', 'own', 'display', 'characteristics', 'are', 'original', 'rather', 'simply', 'playing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'whole', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'China', 'yet', 'whole', 'world', 'wonder', 'be', 'experienced', 'there', 'Forget', 'washed', 'out', 'visuals', 'seen', 'tons', 'poorly', 'made', 'kung', 'fu', 'films', 'past', 'doors', 'have', 'opened', 'something', 'different', 'country']",N/A

In this production, it comes in a surprising blend of comedy and tragedy -- most surprising of all, perhaps, in how well it works.(Spoilers)This movie starts on a peculiar note, with a set of Persian merchants selling the aforementioned wife a gun; this scene is peculiar for its uncharacteristic flamboyance, which is very unlike the rest of the film. With this introduction, one expects something very outrageous and silly; what follows is a pleasant surprise, then.The weapons-dealing brings a squad of officers into town, and one of them in particular is interested in the couple's relationship. He reports their relationship to her abusive husband (who, we learn, had bought her ten years ago, and abuses her regularly); he pays the detective to do away with his wife and her lover and bury them both where no one will ever find them. The detective agrees, and presents him with bloodied clothing as evidence of the successful completion of his task. Alas for the abusive old pervert, he's lying...shooting him with the wife's gun, the detective sets out to rob the old man's safe. Except, he doesn't know the combination.Meanwhile, no one knows that the old man is dead; his wife is planning to try to force him to agree to their divorce...or else to kill herself (or him). At the same time, one of their coworkers, who is owed money by the old man, has learned the combination to the safe.A comedy of errors ensues, where bad timing, accidental discoveries, and ill fortune sees the characters stumbling onto the scenes of murder, interrupting robberies, and misjudging each other's motives. This comedy comes to a cruel end, however, when, inevitably, the various characters' paths intersect with one another. As the body count goes up, the humor takes on a more morbid tone, coming to its eventual end with two townsfolk alive (one still in town, and another fled).(end spoilers)As bizarre as such a hodgepodge of happenings and characters sounds, it was really quite good. The ending was very sad, and the very beginning silly, but overall it was very good. 5/5 stars, for a unique and interesting film.",5,"Dark, comedic and enthralling",1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,2340,"['When', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'abusive', 'cruel', 'wealthy', 'older', 'husband', 'comfort', 'companionship', 'weak-willed', 'sweet', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'husband', 'noodle', 'shop', 'trouble', 'bound', 'ensue', 'production', 'surprising', 'blend', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'most', 'surprising', 'perhaps', 'how', 'well', 'Spoilers', 'movie', 'peculiar', 'note', 'set', 'Persian', 'merchants', 'selling', 'aforementioned', 'wife', 'gun', 'scene', 'peculiar', 'uncharacteristic', 'flamboyance', 'very', 'rest', 'film', 'introduction', 'one', 'something', 'very', 'outrageous', 'silly', 'what', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'then.The', 'weapons-dealing', 'squad', 'officers', 'town', 'one', 'particular', 'interested', 'couple', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'abusive', 'husband', 'who', 'learn', 'had', 'bought', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'regularly', 'detective', 'do', 'away', 'wife', 'lover', 'bury', 'where', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'detective', 'agrees', 'bloodied', 'clothing', 'evidence', 'successful', 'completion', 'task', 'Alas', 'abusive', 'old', 'pervert', 'lying', 'shooting', 'wife', 'gun', 'detective', 'sets', 'out', 'rob', 'old', 'man', 'safe', ""n't"", 'know', 'combination.Meanwhile', 'one', 'old', 'man', 'dead', 'wife', 'planning', 'try', 'force', 'agree', 'divorce', 'else', 'kill', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'coworkers', 'who', 'owed', 'money', 'old', 'man', 'learned', 'combination', 'safe.A', 'comedy', 'errors', 'ensues', 'where', 'bad', 'timing', 'accidental', 'discoveries', 'ill', 'fortune', 'characters', 'stumbling', 'scenes', 'murder', 'interrupting', 'robberies', 'misjudging', 'other', 'motives', 'comedy', 'cruel', 'end', 'however', 'when', 'inevitably', 'various', 'characters', 'paths', 'intersect', 'one', 'body', 'count', 'up', 'humor', 'more', 'morbid', 'tone', 'coming', 'eventual', 'end', 'two', 'townsfolk', 'alive', 'one', 'still', 'town', 'fled', 'end', 'spoilers', 'As', 'bizarre', 'such', 'hodgepodge', 'happenings', 'characters', 'sounds', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'very', 'beginning', 'silly', 'overall', 'was', 'very', 'good', '5/5', 'stars', 'unique', 'interesting', 'film']",N/A

1380314,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0041KKY9M,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","In the opening of Yimou Zhang's ""A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop,"" a young wife of a tyrannical noodle shop owner buys a gun with three bullets from a traveling Persian merchant. Of course, she has a good reason. And perhaps she shouldn't have. A seemingly small decision she has made results in misunderstanding and strife among the characters. Some get greedy. Others make plans. All get involved in the chain of events that gets increasingly messy.As you know, this is the acclaimed Chinese director's version of ""Blood Simple."" Not many directors would attempt to remake the Coen Brothers film, but Yimou Zhang thought differently. His effort ""A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop,"" it is certain, is a quite unique film. Its visuals are unforgettable, and so are the characters (at least, how they look). But sadly they are stuck in the slow-moving story. After the promising start (noodle-making scene is amazing), the film descends into sheer dullness. Things get repetitious (the methodical habits of a police officer are at first amusing, but soon become tedious).The most impressive thing about the film is its stunning landscapes of the blue sky and the red desert. They are almost surreal. Another notable thing is that ""A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop"" sometimes looks like a stage production with colorful costumes of the characters. Actions take place in and around the noodle shop located in the middle of nowhere. The film's time is not specified. Perhaps that is not very important.But frankly I don't know what ""A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop"" is all about. I don't know either what really made the director re-imagine the original in the first place.
