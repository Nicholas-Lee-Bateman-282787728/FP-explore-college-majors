1233482,A19EKAWXJ8MY0F,B001RL8WXI,A. C. Cronvich,"[1, 1]","This is a rather peculiar item. It's pretty hard to resist the title,"" The Terminators "" combined with this box art. But if your expecting an army of humanoid robots like the ones on the cover you will certainly be disappointed. There isn't much of a lot/story to this. Just a lot of disjointed stuff happens. Taking place in a future time, soon enough to still have cell phones, yet far enough that lifelike androids serve man and seemingly have replaced humans in at least one military function. For some reason or another (its hard to figure) these cybernetic musclemen have turned on us and dropped a big bomb on a major U.S. city. Now we follow  a group of simple small town folk as they try to survive the onslaught while trying to get to a space station to turn the androids/cyborgs off. Why this is their job and no one else is trying to get there is a mystery. The otherconflict comes when it is learned that any of the humans may actually be robots themselves and they must deduct who is friend and who is foe.The major problem with all of this is the tiny shot on video budget and look of the movie, and the most disjointed editing I have ever seen. I really had a hard time telling where on character is in relation to another. Very confusing. A lot of characters just dont behave logically or even how a human being would react at all. Several characters display bizarre actions and decision making. At times it is actually hard to tell what people are saying. That certainly doesn't help. And I am not revealing any ""spoilers"" when I say that the movie has no end, resolution or climax. The movie simply stops, as though the film broke or, more than likely was never finished. And that is the overall feeling you get from this film. Unfinished. You feel from time to time that something is missing and often there is no motivation for characters to behave as they do. Likewise, conflicts are introduced and never resolved.To be fair. The special effects, all digital, are quite good. Not incredible but certainly much better than you would expect from a cheapie such as this. There is a boss robot that does look like the ones on the cover art. But it is only one. The rest are all just musclemen in tanktops. Some, but not all, are played by the same actor, suggesting an assembly like production. The commentary is also very strange and it is almost impossible to make out what they are saying.",1,hmmmm...

However, the movie runs out of steam as the end approaches, and many plot threads are left unresolved and unexplained.  The movie ends with a dull, boring whimper.  No explanations, no real climax.  It is almost a three-star movie.  I would watch it again knowing its limitations.Paul Logan is perfect as the Terminators; you don't think a movie called ""The Terminators"" would have just one Terminator, do ya?  A.

I expected a B-movie but instead was 'treated' to a D-movie. Honestly, I had high hope with the decent cast and cool looking cover (though all they do is clone the same robot image over and over). Very misleading though. What I got was nonsensical action, a choppy plot, aweful story and fairly bad acting.

The plot is part Battlestar Galactica (the android at the end is a Cylon) and part Terminator. They got a weightlifter to run around and be a killing android monster. There are supposed to be hundreds of these things, and I can almost buy they all look like the same guy but why are they all dressed exactly the same? The `acting' in this movie is bad, but so is the plot, the script and the directing, so why be picky? The special effects have picked up a bit from Asylum's early days, which isn't saying a lot. They still could be a lot worse.The ending really left a bad taste in my mouth, to be honest. I can forgive a lot about a movie if the end at least makes sense, but this one is left me scratching my head. Who is a robot and who isn't? Why does.... Well, I can't say that without giving away the end, but the way the main robot is defeated doesn't really make sense.Look, it's obviously a cheesy D rate movie. Have your eyes open going in. I always get a little peeved at the reviewers that snark ""THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE EVER"", I mean, looking at it, you know it's not Oscar material.
