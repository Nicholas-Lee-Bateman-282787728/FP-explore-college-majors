But one doesn't expect this from the Tolstoys.""- January 29, 1899The Diaries of Sofia TolstoyIn ""Angel"", a grocer's daughter rises from poverty, and longing for the estate of Paradise, to celebrity. She lives a life of fantasy. She weaves a complex web of lies- from claiming she is of noble birth to saying that her mother was a concert pianist. Romola Garai is excellent as Angel, who treats the people in her life like characters out of a novel. Despite being selfish and spoiled, Garai manages to make her relatable. Sam Neill and Charlotte Rampling are touching as the married couple who publish her books. While Angel writes overblown romantic fantasies, they have a quiet, affectionate, steady love over the years. Angel lives in her romance novels- not unlikeMadame BovaryorAnna KareninaShe falls for the handsome painter Esme (whose name is the same as that of the island where Edward and Bella honeymoon inBreaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga)), and it's obvious she falls for the redheaded Esme (Michael Fassbender, who does a marvelous job of being gorgeous) because he's handsome. As he shows off his drab paintings (even his sister Nora dislikes them), she's admiring him. While Angel thinks her writing is magnificent... Esme understands that he's mediocre. In an odd way, he's like Leo Tolstoy, who pretended to be a peasant and liked writing about grim subjects- such as Siberia inResurrection (Oxford World's Classics)and a wife's murder inKreutzer Sonata. Tolstoy was a Count and took on a peasant persona, while Esme is aristocracy, yet lives in a dreary flat and paints industrial landscapes. Angel proposes to Esme by telling him she'll pay off his debts, not unlike Princess Maria Bolkonsky to Nicholas Rostov inWar and Peace (Oxford World's Classics). As they passionately kiss in a rainstorm, a rainbow bursts out behind them. Their marriage lacks such passion. Esme doesn't appreciate Angel's romances; she disdains his paintings and rejects his affections. She'd rather write about her romance novel characters making love than make love to her handsome, red haired husband. When World War One breaks out, Angel embraces pacifism. Angel's final breakdown coincides with World War One- not unlike Sofia Tolstoy (or Vaslav Nijinsky) When Esme returns, she reads aloud her latest novel about a Czarina enamored of a revolutionary. Angel is cold to Esme's needs and his PTSD. He ends up killing himself. When Esme dies, Angel suffers her final breakdown, with Nora always at her side. Her final disintegration is tragic. When she meets her husband's mistress, Angelica, she has lost it. Angelica isn't a glamorous mistress living an impassioned romantic life- she's an ordinary wife and mother. Like Esme, she's a painter. Angel loses all sense of reality.""Angel"" is an excellently tacky movie; Francois Ozon's movie soars.",5,"""I don't care about what is real, but what is beautiful""",1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,3019,"['women', 'especially', 'wife-', 'love', 'act', 'characters', 'novel', 'even', 'times', 'husbands', 'love', 'sentimental', 'strolls', 'love', 'be', 'emotionally', 'cherished', 'one', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Tolstoys', 'January', '29', '1899The', 'Diaries', 'Sofia', 'TolstoyIn', 'Angel', 'grocer', 'daughter', 'poverty', 'longing', 'estate', 'Paradise', 'celebrity', 'life', 'fantasy', 'complex', 'web', 'lies-', 'claiming', 'noble', 'birth', 'saying', 'mother', 'was', 'concert', 'pianist', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'excellent', 'Angel', 'who', 'people', 'life', 'characters', 'novel', 'being', 'selfish', 'spoiled', 'Garai', 'make', 'relatable', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'are', 'touching', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'books', 'Angel', 'overblown', 'romantic', 'fantasies', 'have', 'quiet', 'affectionate', 'steady', 'love', 'years', 'Angel', 'romance', 'novels-', 'not', 'unlikeMadame', 'BovaryorAnna', 'KareninaShe', 'handsome', 'painter', 'Esme', 'name', 'same', 'island', 'where', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'honeymoon', 'inBreaking', 'Dawn', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'obvious', 'redheaded', 'Esme', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'who', 'marvelous', 'job', 'being', 'gorgeous', 'handsome', 'drab', 'paintings', 'even', 'sister', 'Nora', 'admiring', 'Angel', 'writing', 'magnificent', 'Esme', 'mediocre', 'odd', 'way', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'who', 'pretended', 'be', 'peasant', 'liked', 'writing', 'grim', 'subjects-', 'such', 'Siberia', 'inResurrection', 'Oxford', 'World', 'Classics', 'wife', 'murder', 'inKreutzer', 'Sonata', 'Tolstoy', 'was', 'Count', 'took', 'peasant', 'persona', 'Esme', 'aristocracy', 'dreary', 'flat', 'paints', 'industrial', 'landscapes', 'Angel', 'Esme', 'telling', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'off', 'debts', 'not', 'Princess', 'Maria', 'Bolkonsky', 'Nicholas', 'Rostov', 'inWar', 'Peace', 'Oxford', 'World', 'Classics', 'passionately', 'kiss', 'rainstorm', 'rainbow', 'out', 'marriage', 'lacks', 'such', 'passion', 'Esme', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Angel', 'romances', 'paintings', 'affections', ""'d"", 'rather', 'write', 'romance', 'novel', 'characters', 'making', 'love', 'make', 'love', 'handsome', 'red', 'haired', 'husband', 'When', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'out', 'Angel', 'pacifism', 'Angel', 'final', 'breakdown', 'coincides', 'World', 'War', 'One-', 'not', 'Sofia', 'Tolstoy', 'Vaslav', 'Nijinsky', 'When', 'Esme', 'returns', 'aloud', 'latest', 'novel', 'Czarina', 'enamored', 'revolutionary', 'Angel', 'cold', 'Esme', 'needs', 'PTSD', 'up', 'killing', 'When', 'Esme', 'Angel', 'final', 'breakdown', 'Nora', 'always', 'side', 'final', 'disintegration', 'tragic', 'When', 'husband', 'mistress', 'Angelica', 'lost', 'Angelica', ""n't"", 'glamorous', 'mistress', 'living', 'impassioned', 'romantic', 'life-', 'ordinary', 'wife', 'mother', 'Esme', 'painter', 'Angel', 'sense', 'reality', 'Angel', 'excellently', 'tacky', 'movie', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'movie', 'soars']",Angel (2007) - Extended Edition

Chesterton once said that, ""A good novel tells us the truth about its hero; but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author.""He could have been talking about Angel Deverill, the sentimental young novelist in the middle of ""Angel."" This colorful, lush little movie is basedon a novelby Elizabeth Taylor (no, not THAT Elizabeth Taylor), and Romola Garai brilliantly brings to life a protagonist who is swamped by her own imagination... until reality intrudes.As a teenage girl in a dumpy little town, Angel Deverill (Garai) dreamed of becoming a famous, wealthy authoress. In time her sentimental, dramatic novels become huge bestsellers, and soon Angel is living the life she's always dreamed of -- a vast mansion, a luxurious life, and a neverending spring of melodramatic ideas.Soon her real life becomes almost as dramatic as her fantasy life, especially when she falls in love with an impoverished painter named Esme (Michael Fassbender). But when Angel is confronted by death, marriage, war and the loss of her loved ones, she discovers that a dramatic life can also be the worst kind....Rich ballrooms, sumptuous mansions, dramatic confessions of love, and endless swathes of gold, velvet and marble -- ""Angel"" is a luscious playground for the senses. For the first half, it seems like Angel is living out one of her own novels, but gradually a darker tone starts to creep into the story (such as when Esme tries to rape Angel).And Franois Ozon has fun with the more ironic moments, mainly by pushing them over the top -- Angel and Esme's first kiss is set in a rainstorm, against a sunset AND with a rainbow overhead, and Angel greets Nora while posing in front of a harp in a flowing bright-pink gown. It's both amusing and heartbreaking to see Angel building up an iridescent bubble of make-believe to live in, only to have it popped by the real world.Angel is not a heroine, really -- it doesn't take long for us to find out she's immature, selfish and insensitive, and a compulsive liar who constantly embroiders her mundane past. So it's a credit to Garai's talent that she actually makes us like Angel most of the time, putting her limpid eyes and trembly mouth to perfect use. And as her life falls apart, it's painful to see this child-woman being hammered by reality until she shatters.Fassbender is as excellent but much darker, as we see the moody Esme moving from an edgy young painter into a self-destructive shell of his former self. And Lucy Russell has a good role as the devoted fan who gets to work for her favorite author, only to be subsumed into her life.""Angel"" is a tragic, dramatic, irony-soaked little story with a clueless anti-heroine -- but for Romola Garai's finest role, definitely a must-see.",4,"""I'm not interested in what's real, but what's beautiful!""",1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,2738,"['G.K.', 'Chesterton', 'once', 'said', 'good', 'novel', 'tells', 'truth', 'hero', 'bad', 'novel', 'tells', 'truth', 'author', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'talking', 'Angel', 'Deverill', 'sentimental', 'young', 'novelist', 'middle', 'Angel', 'colorful', 'lush', 'little', 'movie', 'novelby', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'not', 'THAT', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'brilliantly', 'life', 'protagonist', 'who', 'swamped', 'own', 'imagination', 'reality', 'intrudes.As', 'teenage', 'girl', 'dumpy', 'little', 'town', 'Angel', 'Deverill', 'Garai', 'dreamed', 'becoming', 'famous', 'wealthy', 'authoress', 'time', 'sentimental', 'dramatic', 'novels', 'become', 'huge', 'bestsellers', 'soon', 'Angel', 'living', 'life', 'always', 'dreamed', 'vast', 'mansion', 'luxurious', 'life', 'neverending', 'spring', 'melodramatic', 'ideas.Soon', 'real', 'life', 'almost', 'as', 'dramatic', 'fantasy', 'life', 'especially', 'when', 'love', 'impoverished', 'painter', 'named', 'Esme', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'when', 'Angel', 'confronted', 'death', 'marriage', 'war', 'loss', 'loved', 'ones', 'dramatic', 'life', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'worst', 'kind', '.Rich', 'ballrooms', 'sumptuous', 'mansions', 'dramatic', 'confessions', 'love', 'endless', 'swathes', 'gold', 'velvet', 'marble', 'Angel', 'luscious', 'playground', 'senses', 'first', 'half', 'Angel', 'living', 'out', 'one', 'own', 'novels', 'gradually', 'darker', 'tone', 'creep', 'story', 'such', 'when', 'Esme', 'rape', 'Angel', '.And', 'Franois', 'Ozon', 'fun', 'more', 'ironic', 'moments', 'mainly', 'pushing', 'top', 'Angel', 'Esme', 'first', 'kiss', 'set', 'rainstorm', 'sunset', 'AND', 'rainbow', 'overhead', 'Angel', 'greets', 'Nora', 'posing', 'front', 'harp', 'flowing', 'bright-pink', 'gown', 'amusing', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'Angel', 'building', 'up', 'iridescent', 'bubble', 'make-believe', 'live', 'only', 'have', 'popped', 'real', 'world.Angel', 'not', 'heroine', 'really', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'find', 'out', 'immature', 'selfish', 'insensitive', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'who', 'constantly', 'mundane', 'past', 'credit', 'Garai', 'talent', 'actually', 'Angel', 'most', 'time', 'putting', 'limpid', 'eyes', 'trembly', 'mouth', 'perfect', 'use', 'life', 'apart', 'painful', 'see', 'child-woman', 'being', 'hammered', 'reality', 'excellent', 'much', 'darker', 'see', 'moody', 'Esme', 'moving', 'edgy', 'young', 'painter', 'self-destructive', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'Lucy', 'Russell', 'good', 'role', 'devoted', 'fan', 'who', 'work', 'favorite', 'author', 'only', 'be', 'subsumed', 'life', 'Angel', 'tragic', 'dramatic', 'irony-soaked', 'little', 'story', 'clueless', 'anti-heroine', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'finest', 'role', 'definitely', 'must-see']",Angel (2007) - Extended Edition

The luminous and criminally underrated Romola Garai portrays the title character, which I'm told Elizabeth Taylor (the author) based upon the mega-best-selling Edwardian era author, Marie Corelli. The temperamental and charismatic Corelli had a rags-to-riches climb to become the 1900s equivalent of Nora Roberts and Dan Brown, and Angel Deverell's personality and path to success follows this trajectory. Though the film is glorious in color and pizzaz (some of the gowns worn by Garai are absolutely stunning, and the DVD cover highlights one of the more visually appealing scenes in the movie), the movie is aggravating. Angel Deverell is a thoroughly unlikeable character, but the script never gives us a reason to care for her, or even to understand her unpleasantness. Equally odd is Esm&eacute; (Michael Fassbender), a spoiled and brooding man whose experiences in WWI make him more repelling than compelling. However, taken as a whole, rather than in bits and pieces, the film is both fascinating and disturbing, and Angel is grasping, egotistical, self-assured, and talented, and her forcing of the world to be a crazy, self-invented fairy tale is addictive. The film is very far from perfect, and the ending is abrupt and baffling, but it is an unforgettable experience.",3,"Brilliantly colorful, wonderfully acted, but marred by a horrid script",1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,1475,"['was', 'released', '2007', 'was', 'when', 'managed', 'snag', 'copy', 'gap', 'three', 'years', 'distinctly', 'recall', 'how', 'wonderful', 'film', 'was', 'look', 'how', 'boring', 'was', 'watch', 'luminous', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'title', 'character', ""'m"", 'told', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'author', 'based', 'mega-best-selling', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'author', 'Marie', 'Corelli', 'temperamental', 'charismatic', 'Corelli', 'had', 'rags-to-riches', 'climb', 'become', '1900s', 'equivalent', 'Nora', 'Roberts', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'Angel', 'Deverell', 'personality', 'path', 'success', 'trajectory', 'film', 'glorious', 'color', 'pizzaz', 'gowns', 'worn', 'Garai', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'DVD', 'cover', 'highlights', 'one', 'more', 'visually', 'appealing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'movie', 'aggravating', 'Angel', 'Deverell', 'thoroughly', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'script', 'never', 'reason', 'care', 'even', 'understand', 'unpleasantness', 'Equally', 'odd', 'Esm', 'eacute', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'spoiled', 'brooding', 'man', 'experiences', 'WWI', 'make', 'more', 'repelling', 'compelling', 'However', 'taken', 'whole', 'rather', 'bits', 'pieces', 'film', 'fascinating', 'disturbing', 'Angel', 'grasping', 'egotistical', 'self-assured', 'talented', 'forcing', 'world', 'be', 'crazy', 'self-invented', 'fairy', 'tale', 'addictive', 'film', 'very', 'far', 'perfect', 'ending', 'abrupt', 'baffling', 'unforgettable', 'experience']",Angel (2007) - Extended Edition

1184407,A106016KSI0YQ,B001E1B6P2,Jay Dickson,"[5, 8]","Elizabeth Taylor's ANGEL is a writer's novel, much beloved by other novelists because of its tricky premise. At the turn of the century, in a small manufacturing town, Angel Deverell, the grocer's daughter, is convinced of her own genius as a novelist (the fact that she doesn't enjoy other people's novels does not seem in any way a setback to her). Contemptuous of her aunt's service as a maid at a local estate, Angel dreams of one day having enough money to buy the manor home herself... and through sheer determination, plus her dogged belief in her own romantic fantasies (which sell novels in the hundreds of thousands), she is successful. She also buys the handsomest man she meets, and enthralls his sister as her private secretary. And then everything falls apart.The biggest mistake that the French film director Francois Ozon made in making this novel into a film was to cast Romola Garai in the central role, and insisted she bring her loopier and endearing qualities to the part. Probably he imagined that was the only way to the put the exceptionally unlikeable Angel over to film audiences, but it in effect guts the story: the fascination of Taylor's novel is to see this fierce and frightening eagle get everything she wants, and Garai can only play her as a silly goose. It's impossible to imagine her Angel intimidating everyone in her town and staring down wealthy London publishers: Garai seems like a complete pushover. She's terrific in her later scenes (when the aging Angel becomes something of a haunted guy of a woman in her huge picture hats and feathers), but there's no edge to her Angel whatsoever in the crucial early scenes, and Ozon makes things worse for her by filming everything in her town as lovely and snowy and supplying a nostalgic Masterpiece Theatre score. There's excellent supporting work from Sam O'Neill as her publisher, Charlotte Rampling as his wife, Michael Fassbender (in one of the first film roles to get him noticed) as Angel's caddish and tormented husband, and hard-faced Lucy Russell as Angel's dogged girl Friday.

Her story begins innocently enough - a rude, spoiled, inconsiderate schoolgirl who dreams and writes (Una Stubbs - from BBC's Sherlock - has a small role as Angel's teacher) and eventually rockets her way to money, success, and stardom. Angel buys her dream house, marries the man she loves (played by Michael Fassbender - Rochester in 2011's Jane Eyre), but as war looms on the horizon Angel's life begins to unravel. Her writing takes a depressing turn and she begins to take on a ghostly, pale, witchlike appearance as she holes herself up in her mansion with her dog, her numerous cats, and her sister-in-law.There is some nudity in this movie, but my major fault with it is that I don't know exactly what this film was trying to portray. Sadness and depression throughout, but I did love Sam Neill's (with a mustache!) performance as Angel's publisher ... who also may or may not be in love with her. Sam Neill is always great in every role I've seen him in.I also thought that somewhere toward the middle and ending the movie began feeling slow and drawn-out, but I still felt compelled to keep watching and see what happened to Angel and the people surrounding her.

As an author myself, having had times of building my own make-believe worlds to shut out the pain of reality, I totally understood the driving force behind Angel's need to rewrite her life in order to survive it.  Creativity sometimes borders on a type of madness, but it's difficult to understand unless you've been pushed to the edge.It's obvious Angel had deep emotional problems.  Her way of coping with these emotions was fantasy.  She fell in love with the idea of love with a man she fantasized about, but it was the reality of the painful truth that was her undoing in the end.  Though the beginning is filled with what I call ""fluff"" of Angel's rise in popularity as a writer, the starkness of her dark life in the end was a great contrast.  She loved her husband like the characters in her books loved their heros - blindly and with a tad of selfish obsessive possessiveness.Ironically, the home she dreamed about her entire life, Paradise, became the very thing that stole her happiness from her.  Not exactly the Paradise she had dreamed of as a child.  Even when your dreams are often achieved, rather than a silver lining, it turns out to be a black cloud.The the costumes and indoor settings are stunning, but there is poor cinematography in scenes that distract somewhat from the story cheapening the film.All in all, I enjoy it.  I'm more of the drama tragic type anyway.",4,Insanity of Genius,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1468,"['film', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', 'author', 'having', 'had', 'times', 'building', 'own', 'make-believe', 'worlds', 'shut', 'out', 'pain', 'reality', 'totally', 'understood', 'driving', 'force', 'Angel', 'need', 'rewrite', 'life', 'order', 'survive', 'Creativity', 'sometimes', 'borders', 'type', 'madness', 'difficult', 'understand', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pushed', 'edge.It', 'obvious', 'Angel', 'had', 'deep', 'emotional', 'problems', 'way', 'coping', 'emotions', 'was', 'fantasy', 'fell', 'love', 'idea', 'love', 'man', 'fantasized', 'about', 'was', 'reality', 'painful', 'truth', 'was', 'undoing', 'end', 'beginning', 'filled', 'what', 'call', 'fluff', 'Angel', 'rise', 'popularity', 'writer', 'starkness', 'dark', 'life', 'end', 'was', 'great', 'contrast', 'loved', 'husband', 'characters', 'books', 'loved', 'heros', 'blindly', 'tad', 'selfish', 'obsessive', 'possessiveness.Ironically', 'home', 'dreamed', 'entire', 'life', 'Paradise', 'became', 'very', 'thing', 'stole', 'happiness', 'Not', 'exactly', 'Paradise', 'had', 'dreamed', 'child', 'Even', 'when', 'dreams', 'are', 'often', 'achieved', 'rather', 'silver', 'lining', 'out', 'be', 'black', 'cloud.The', 'costumes', 'indoor', 'settings', 'are', 'stunning', 'poor', 'cinematography', 'scenes', 'distract', 'somewhat', 'story', 'cheapening', 'film.All', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'more', 'drama', 'tragic', 'type', 'anyway']",Angel (2007) - Extended Edition
