1138049,ABOFSEB0YMYCR,B0012OVCE6,,"[3, 3]","OK, I loved the 2-hour version with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet.  It's probably impossible for anyone to play Marianne better than Winslet.  That being said, this Andrew Davies' adaptation has some clear advantages for Austin lovers.First, Davies' screenplay is able to bring us more details in this extended version.  The girls are isolated, and practically penniless upon the death of their father.  The seaside location, both desolate and magnificent, is a reminder of grim hopes for marriage. (In our liberated times, we forget that in those days, marriage meant survival).  Dominic Cooper's Willoughby is insightful. He does a fantastic job of walking the line between dashing and sleazy, the best I've seen.Andrew Davies includes details from Austin, such as a duel between Willoughby and Colonel Brandon, and comments from characters which indicate that Marianne has ruined her reputation with her lack of sense. Colonel Brandon's rescue of her is truly chivalrous. One might argue that Edward's wood-cutting scene, or his cute-meet with Elinor were not pure Austin, but for the most part Davies' Austin instinct is spot-on.The production values are good, the acting is top-notch, and this version of Sense and Sensibility is in the same league as Davies' screenplay of Pride and Prejudice.

1138050,A11ZG7PKB6ZZZC,B0012OVCE6,A. Anderson,"[7, 9]","I gave this DVD 5 stars because it includes Miss Austen Regrets, which was amazing.  I would give S&S; 4 stars.  If you're a Janeite and you haven't yet seen Miss Austen Regrets, you're in for a treat.  I didn't think it was possible that I could ever like a biographical novel about Jane Austen, but this one takes as its theme ""Art transcends life"" and it's a subtle, deft, smart, melancholy little film.  Hearing Olivia Williams read lines from Persuasion was the best adaptation of Persuasion to film that I have seen yet!  This movie is bittersweet, like Persuasion.  Persuasion (the book) is still best, which is, of course, the point of this movie: real life is never as gorgeous and well-orchestrated as that which an amazing imagination and phenomenal talent and genius can create.  Really well done.As for S&S;, I didn't see Part 1 unfortunately, but I am a little glad to have missed the whole Willoughby storyline.  I would, though, have liked to have seen Elinor's and Edward's initial attraction, because these two actors do actually have chemistry together.  Based on Part 2, I liked this adaptation more than the Ang Lee/Emma Thompson one.  For one thing, Elinor wasn't middle-aged!  I never could get past Emma Thompson's ego when I watched that version.  This version also seems more subtle.  The Emma Thompson screenplay screams ""one sister is sense and one sister is sensibility! Get it? Get it? Get it?""  Whereas the novel is so much more complicated than that.  But I still would like to see Elinor played with a little more vulnerability.  The novel is about two young women (under 20), each trying to understand the world and to choose the best way to live one's life.  Elinor always gets played in film adaptations as though she is very sure of herself, which takes away a lot of the character's likeability.  However, in this version of S&S;, Elinor and Edward are charming when they are together (sweet, fumbling guy and shy, nerdy girl).Part 2 of S&S; concentrated on the Marianne-Brandon relationship instead of the Marianne-Willoughby relationship and I very much appreciated how that romance was handled.  I am surprised by the Alan Rickman fan-base here, because to me he ruined that earlier version.  For one thing, he looked way too old, which made their marriage very unpalatable.  I get the creeps everytime I see them walk out of the church together.  And Rickman delivers a mumbling, sleepwalking performance.  In this version, Col. Brandon is older than Marianne, yes, but they make him masculine and vigorous.  And the screenplay takes the time to point out (to us and to Marianne) that Col. Brandon is the man she always wanted (""the true Romantic""), the man she believed Willoughby to be, and that in marrying him she is achieving her heart's desire, not settling and resigning herself to a ""sensible"" life.  In this newest version, he is like a chivalrous knight, which is what Marianne dreams of, and which also suits her perfectly, because the one thing Marianne really has going for her is that she is probably Jane Austen's bravest heroine.  The viewer gets the idea that this couple can do a lot together, and that Brandon will never hold Marianne back, and that's very Jane Austen-ish, so it's a good adaptation.I would recommend this DVD.  Two savory treats in one package.",5,S&S good; Miss Austen Regrets better,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,3323,"['gave', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Regrets', 'was', 'amazing', 'would', 'give', 'S', 'S', '4', 'stars', ""'re"", 'Janeite', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Regrets', ""'re"", 'treat', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'could', 'ever', 'like', 'biographical', 'novel', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'one', 'theme', 'Art', 'life', 'subtle', 'deft', 'smart', 'melancholy', 'little', 'film', 'Hearing', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'read', 'lines', 'Persuasion', 'was', 'best', 'adaptation', 'Persuasion', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'yet', 'movie', 'bittersweet', 'Persuasion', 'Persuasion', 'book', 'still', 'best', 'course', 'point', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'never', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'well-orchestrated', 'amazing', 'imagination', 'phenomenal', 'talent', 'genius', 'can', 'create', 'Really', 'well', 'done.As', 'S', 'S', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Part', '1', 'unfortunately', 'am', 'little', 'glad', 'have', 'missed', 'whole', 'Willoughby', 'storyline', 'would', 'though', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Elinor', 'Edward', 'initial', 'attraction', 'two', 'actors', 'do', 'actually', 'have', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Based', 'Part', '2', 'liked', 'adaptation', 'more', 'Ang', 'Lee/Emma', 'Thompson', 'one', 'one', 'thing', 'Elinor', 'was', ""n't"", 'middle-aged', 'never', 'could', 'get', 'past', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'ego', 'when', 'watched', 'version', 'version', 'also', 'more', 'subtle', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'screenplay', 'screams', 'one', 'sister', 'sense', 'one', 'sister', 'sensibility', 'Get', 'Get', 'Get', 'novel', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'still', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Elinor', 'played', 'little', 'more', 'vulnerability', 'novel', 'two', 'young', 'women', '20', 'trying', 'understand', 'world', 'choose', 'best', 'way', 'live', 'one', 'life', 'Elinor', 'always', 'played', 'film', 'adaptations', 'very', 'sure', 'herself', 'away', 'lot', 'character', 'likeability', 'However', 'version', 'S', 'S', 'Elinor', 'Edward', 'are', 'charming', 'when', 'are', 'together', 'sweet', 'fumbling', 'guy', 'shy', 'nerdy', 'girl', '2', 'S', 'S', 'concentrated', 'Marianne-Brandon', 'relationship', 'instead', 'Marianne-Willoughby', 'relationship', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'how', 'romance', 'was', 'handled', 'am', 'surprised', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'fan-base', 'here', 'ruined', 'earlier', 'version', 'one', 'thing', 'looked', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'made', 'marriage', 'very', 'unpalatable', 'get', 'creeps', 'everytime', 'see', 'walk', 'church', 'together', 'Rickman', 'mumbling', 'sleepwalking', 'performance', 'version', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'older', 'Marianne', 'yes', 'make', 'masculine', 'vigorous', 'screenplay', 'time', 'point', 'out', 'Marianne', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'man', 'always', 'wanted', 'true', 'Romantic', 'man', 'believed', 'Willoughby', 'be', 'marrying', 'achieving', 'heart', 'desire', 'not', 'settling', 'resigning', 'sensible', 'life', 'newest', 'version', 'chivalrous', 'knight', 'what', 'Marianne', 'dreams', 'also', 'suits', 'perfectly', 'one', 'thing', 'Marianne', 'really', 'going', 'probably', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'bravest', 'heroine', 'viewer', 'idea', 'couple', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'together', 'Brandon', 'will', 'never', 'hold', 'Marianne', 'back', 'very', 'Jane', 'Austen-ish', 'good', 'adaptation.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Two', 'savory', 'treats', 'one', 'package']",N/A
1138051,AVW7F3JS3C7QE,B0012OVCE6,Alice Liddel,"[2, 4]","Sense and Sensibility is about two sisters, who seem lucky, and very unlucky in love it seems. When their father dies, the Dashwood family (composed of Ms. Dashwood, and her three daughters) are forced to leave their beautiful Manor, and forced to live in a small cottage. Despite this, two of the sisters find love, and doomed love. Elinor Dashwood, the elder, falls for a rich young man; but tied down by social restraints, cannot have him. Marianne Dashwood, falls for a libertine of a man, whom is known to have had many other women...and might even have fathered a child. What will these two sisters do when they realize they cannot have the men they love?Sense and Sensibility got much notoriety when it was made into a movie in 1995, starring; Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, and Emma Thompson. It was a charming feature; but faced many flaws. Characters were not the correct ages, the film seemed a bit too light in places, and many things were omitted.  Still, it was a great movie. When there was going to be a remake, many were shocked. Who would have the audacity to redo such a wonderful film?? Masterpiece Theater that's who. The charming British company has put out many Jane Austen remakes; Pride and Prejudice, Emma, just to name a few.Let's see how the new cast ranks against the old one, shall we?Hattie Morahan takes Emma Thompson's prized role; playing the eldest sister, Elinor Dashwood. While Elinor is the calmer of the three sisters, and obviously the most plainest, Hattie plays her with a certain charm, that makes Elinor much more then a 'simple' girl. While Thompson played Elinor nicely, she was much too old for the film. Hattie is the perfect age, and often rivals Thompson's near perfect performance.Charity Wakefield takes Titanic leading star, Kate Winslet's role as Marianne Dashwood. Marianne is passionate, playful, and spunky. Winslet is known to have played Marianne perfectly, so the new Marianne had some big shoes to fill....and didn't fill them....Somewhere along the road, Charity Wakefield seems to have completely thrown out Marianne's character. There is no spunk, passion, or playful Marianne. Just a very plain girl with no personality. What happened? Is my question. Miss Wakefield ruins the films near perfect cast.David Morrissey, Dan Stevens, and Dominic Cooper play the suitors. Dan Stevens plays Hugh Grants role as Elinor's suitor; and adds much more passion then Hugh's performance. Dominic Cooper was far too cute as the Casanova who's name is; Willoughby. Greg Wise made Willoughby such a wonderful and interesting character in the beginning, and made us hate him when we saw his libertine ways. Cooper makes the role much too 'cute.' And we end up liking him much more then we should. David Morrissey plays Colonel Brandon, the man so in love with Marianne Dashwood. David does a nice job, and we certainly feel very sorry for this love sick character. But Alan Rickman played Colonel Brandon with a gentleness, that made us love him even the more.The rest of the casting was nicely done, although as another reviewer mentioned; it was sad to not see Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer. It was also very odd to see Mark Williams (Mr. Weasley!) playing Sir John Middleton!The costumes are rich, the music beautiful, and the script wonderfully done. The casting is good, though not perfect. Before I go, I must mention my disdain in the fact that Andrew Davies (the writer) seem to 'beef up' the storyline. A few steamy scenes are added; such as the dreadful seducing scene by Willoughby in the beginning.

It IS my favorite version of the two.  That being said, given how awful I felt Persuasion was in this Masterpiece Theater series of ""redos"" of Austen, I frankly felt this film was quite good.  At least in this production, pacing was reasonable (it didn't drag as Persuasion did), all the people I felt were strong actors, screenplay for me was perfectly fine.  This is definitely the best of the ""new"" productions of Austen. There are some interesting, and worthwhile, changes in this screenplay from the Thompson one.  In this one, Lucy Steele has a friend who bumblingly reveals her engagement to Edward to BOTH his sister and mother (and Jean Marsh is wonderful as his mother!).  Willoughby, during Mary Ann's illness, also tries to justify himself to Eleanor, a conversation Mary Ann overhears.  We also get the visit to his aunt's house with Mary Ann added in this production.

1138055,A3SEDVZYQGTRVL,B0012OVCE6,"Amazon Customer ""omnivorous reader""","[5, 5]","This is a lovely and lush film. There are some scenes that don't exist in the book (Sense and Sensibilities by Jane Austen) but are hinted at in the backstory or off the pages. This is a lovely adaptation by Andrew Davies.  Even when he adds scenes not in the book, he maintains faith to the spirit of the book.This film has focused more on the differences between the family's life at Norland and their new life in the cottage in Devonshire, than has been the case in other adaptations. There is a lot of use of the sea and the landscape in Devonshire, highlighting the isolation of the Dashwoods from the life that they once had. From being women of leisure, they now live in a cottage with only two servants and must do much of the menial tasks themselves. They are learning but it's difficult for them as they must learn to economize and yet still maintain their manners and style of living as they associate with Sir John and his family and neighbors.There's obviously a bond between the sisters but where Elinor controls her feelings, Marianne allows her feelings free range. In fact, Marianne at times seems to glory more in showing her feeling to the world than in feeling them herself. Elinor holds her feeling close to herself as treasures, while Marianne paints them on a marquee. In a society where appearance and surface adherence to propriety is more important than the actual propriety, it is dangerous to allow oneself to show what is felt. Elinor's mask of calm protects her from censure or ridicule but Marianne has no such protection as she hides nothing of what she feels.Because of their character they each comes close to loosing what they love. Davies may have changed, added, deleted, or emphasized some of the books scenes but he's nevertheless maintained the heart and soul of the story. We feel for these people and because of the writing and the directing we get a feel for the rigid society in which they lived.It's almost impossible for those of us who have grown up in today's vastly different society where women do have rights and can inherit or work at employment of their own choosing to understand the much narrower choices available to women at the Dashwood's level of society. Remembering too, that much of their problems came from their father's son refusing to honor the promise he made to take care of them. Much of the movie revolves around promises made, promises kept, and promises left unfulfilled. Then, as now, a person isn't honorable because of their place in society, the amount of money or status that they have, but because of their actions.All in all, the film was an excellent rendition of the the novel (as I remember it).

1138057,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B0012OVCE6,Andrew Raker,"[2, 2]","***WARNING: The following review assumes the reader has considerable knowledge of Jane Austen's novel ""Sense and Sensibility."" It is a specific review that discusses the merits of the film on the basis of Austen's literary legacy.The adaptation does follow the novel better than any other adaptation I have viewed, although the 1981 comes a very close second. While Thompson's script was better written, more romantic, and more suspenseful than this ones, Davies' script is more loyal to the novel and Austen's intent (esp. Lucy's character). This is not to say that Thompson's adaptation is subpar because both adaptations are well worth one's viewing and better than the 1971 and 1981 adaptations. However, it is very interesting to watch all four adaptations one after the other and see how each takes its own unique perspective.Below, I have listed some specifics about the Andrew Davies 2008 adaptation in comparison with the Emma Thompson adaptation.Keeps all major characters except for Lady Middleton and her children. (While the viewer is never told that Sir John Middleton's wife is dead as in the 1994 Thompson adaptation, this Davies adaptation does not include scenes with Lady Middleton showing off her not so adorable children.Keeps Fanny's son (Harry) and shows him throughout the film. Harry represents the excesses of his parents.Keeps Margaret Dashwood (unlike the previous two BBC adaptations).Keeps Anne Steele's character and correctly portrays her as the one who accidentally reveals Lucy's secret (unlike the Thompson adaptation).Edward Ferrars might be slightly too handsome. However, the actors playing the Dashwood sisters are approximately the correct ages (much more so than in any previous adaptation, especially the Thompson adaptation).Sequence:The film communicates almost every major scene in the first 2/3rds of the novel, including Willoughby and Marianne's tour of Willoughby's aunt's house, which is explored in some detail (unlike the novel)However, a few scenes are left out:- The scene where Edward reads dispassionately, and Marianne becomes annoyed. (Marianne does reference this event in a conversation with Elinor.)- Any scene including Lady Middleton and her children, including scenes with the Steele sisters and the children (kept in the 1981 adaptation; also excluded in the 1995 adaptation)- The scene where Mrs. Jennings tells Marianne to play the same song she had just finished playing (kept in the 1981 adaptation; also excluded in the 1994 adaptation).- Those that demonstrate Mrs. Jennings subtle comic relief and prying, busybody nature. (EX: Mrs. Jennings does not spend much time speculating why Colonel Brandon suddenly had to leave Barton Park after receiving a mysterious letter. - 1995 adaptation also lacks in this respect.)- The shop scene where the Dashwood sisters first meet Robert Ferrars. (This scene is also not included in the 1981 or 1995 adaptation.Some scenes portrayed quite correctly:- Edward does not behave overly romantically to Elinor while residing at Norland Park.- Lucy is clearly a fortune hunter and a sly young woman who can give subtle hints, especially to Elinor. (Contrast with 1995 adaptation, which never really develops this point).The film seems rushed in the last 1/3rd of the novel. There are many scenes compacted and rapid shifts.Some scenes implied in the novel (but not really explained) are also included.- Colonel Brandon and Willoughby's duel with swords that ends in Willoughby being slightly wounded.- After being told that Lucy Steele has married and is now Mrs. Ferrars, the 2008 adaptation shows a progression of scenes to demonstrate how much this news has affected Elinor (ex: Elinor removes a portrait of Norland Park from the sitting room and replaces it with her own drawing of Barton Cottage).For example:Rapid shift in time from when Mrs. Ferrars turns Edward out of her house and disinherits him until the company ends up at the Palmer's house.~ Skips conversation where Colonel Brandon tells Elinor he wants to offer Edward a church livingRapid shift from when Mrs. Dashwood arrives with Colonel Brandon until the company leaves the Palmers to return to Barton Cottage.Other deviations:- While Marianne walks in the rain and becomes ill in both the novel and this film, in the 2008 adaptation, she walked without telling anyone.- Marianne actually visits Colonel Brandon's house with the colonel to play his piano and watch him charm his pet hawk.- Before Edward arrives at Barton Cottage to set the record straight about which Ferrar brother married Lucy, Marianne tells Elinor that she has accepted Colonel Brandon's offer of marriage.Concluding Scenes (after the marriages):- Colonel Brandon carries Marianne into his large house.- Edward chases chickens with Elinor laughing and smiling in the background.OVERALL THOUGHTS/IMPRESSIONS:The film was more loyal to the novel that the 1995 Thompson adaptation. Of course, the film was also longer, which provided more time to explain important events and develop characters. The adaptation kept my attention equally well as the Thompson adaptation and better than the 1981 BBC adaptation. The film developed the characters rather effectively and relatively accurately. The film also covers every major event in the novel, although some action was necessarily compressed to create a less lengthy and faster paced film than absolute loyalists might like.Overall, I believe this is the best Sense and Sensibility adaptation for loyalists and the second best (after the 1995 Thompson adaptation) for individuals who desire an interesting story with an excellent script. As a third adaptation, I also recommend the 1981 BBC.",5,Enjoyed this BBC adaptation (contrasted with Thompson motion picture adaptation),1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,5685,"['***WARNING',

1138058,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B0012OVCE6,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[2, 2]","This is one of my favorite Jane Austen movies.  I love the Oscar winning film, but this version, in some ways, is even better.Hugh Grant did a great job as Edward Ferrars, one of the male protagonists, but he's still Hugh Grant, whereas Dan Stevens in the BBC movie, not nearly as well known and therefore more believable in the role, did an attractive job portraying Edward, a man who is honorable, yet nave enough to give up a fortune on behalf of a teenage crush, long outgrown. That probably wouldn't happen today, and I don't think it was that common even in Edward's day.Alan Rickman did a commendable job as Colonel Brandon in the movie.  But as fine as his acting skills, he lacks charm, whereas the lessor known David Morrissey shows both the dependability and charm of the character.  In the movie, after losing the attractive Greg Wise as Willoughby,  (who actually married Emma Thompson in real life), I felt that Marianne was settling for 2nd best with Colonel Brandon.  In the BBC version, both the attraction of Colonel Brandon and the sleaziness of Dominic Cooper's Willoughby made me feel that  Marianne had been saved from a horrible mistake.Hattie Morahan does a fine job as Elinor, and Charity Wakefield definitely grows on you as Marianne.  She gives a more subdued performance than the great Kate Winslet, and I wasn't thrilled with her looks at first, (she has too forceful a chin for so feminine a character) but after seeing her a couple of times, I love her in the role.Daisy Haggard gives an memorable comic performance as Miss Steele (sister to Lucy Steele) a role that doesn't appear in the movie and both Claire Skinner in the BBC production and Harriet Walter in the movie do an excellent job as the detestable Fanny Ferrars Dashwood.  Walter's movie performance is more satirical whereas Skinner in the BBC production is the sister-in-law that you truly love to hate.The only thing I don't like about the production is that the company is forcing us to buy and pay for ""Miss Austen Regrets"" in order to purchase ""Sense and Sensibility.""  The sellers know we wouldn't buy the latter movie on its own and so they sneak it into one of the most popular of their productions.",5,Lovely Production,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,2202,"['one', 'favorite', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'movies', 'love', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'version', 'ways', 'even', 'better.Hugh', 'Grant', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'one', 'male', 'protagonists', 'still', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'whereas', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'BBC', 'movie', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'therefore', 'more', 'believable', 'role', 'did', 'attractive', 'job', 'portraying', 'Edward', 'man', 'who', 'honorable', 'yet', 'nave', 'enough', 'give', 'up', 'fortune', 'behalf', 'teenage', 'crush', 'long', 'outgrown', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'common', 'even', 'Edward', 'day.Alan', 'Rickman', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'movie', 'as', 'fine', 'acting', 'skills', 'charm', 'lessor', 'known', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'dependability', 'charm', 'character', 'movie', 'losing', 'attractive', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'Willoughby', 'who', 'actually', 'married', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'real', 'life', 'felt', 'Marianne', 'was', 'settling', '2nd', 'best', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'BBC', 'version', 'attraction', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'sleaziness', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Willoughby', 'made', 'feel', 'Marianne', 'had', 'been', 'saved', 'horrible', 'mistake.Hattie', 'Morahan', 'fine', 'job', 'Elinor', 'Charity', 'Wakefield', 'definitely', 'Marianne', 'more', 'subdued', 'performance', 'great', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'looks', 'first', 'too', 'forceful', 'chin', 'so', 'feminine', 'character', 'seeing', 'couple', 'times', 'love', 'role.Daisy', 'Haggard', 'memorable', 'comic', 'performance', 'Miss', 'Steele', 'sister', 'Lucy', 'Steele', 'role', ""n't"", 'appear', 'movie', 'Claire', 'Skinner', 'BBC', 'production', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'movie', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'detestable', 'Fanny', 'Ferrars', 'Dashwood', 'Walter', 'movie', 'performance', 'more', 'satirical', 'whereas', 'Skinner', 'BBC', 'production', 'sister-in-law', 'truly', 'love', 'hate.The', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'production', 'company', 'forcing', 'buy', 'pay', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Regrets', 'order', 'purchase', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'sellers', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'latter', 'movie', 'own', 'so', 'sneak', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'productions']",N/A
1138059,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B0012OVCE6,A_Plain_Janeite,"[6, 7]","I have to admit I went into this with a bit of a prejudiced opinion...  Partly because of what Andrew Davies (the script writer) had to say beforehand about his version.  Also from pictures/previews, and reading what other fans had to say on AustenBlog.  Personally, I thought the '95 version- on the whole- was fantastic!Anyway, I ended up watching the film in two parts; so my review is divided that way:Pt. 1:- Mr. Davies took it upon himself to show the viewers in the opening seconds of the film- a glimpse of Willoughby in his ""Libertine"" ways (around 9-10 months prior to his Allenham visit).  While background information in some films can be a great help, in this case I think it was a BIG mistake!! ..In my opinion we lose the whole shock of finding it out along with Elinor and Marianne (much later in the book)!!- Who on earth picked Dominic Cooper as Willoughby?!  ..Miss Austen describes him as ""uncommonly handsome.."" who possessed ""manly beauty and more than common gracefulness"".I realize this is a personal opinion; and others might feel otherwise, but in my opinion Mr. Cooper possesses neither!To the ""handsome"" part- he doesn't hold a candle to Greg Wise (Willoughby '95), nor to the Edward Ferrars (Dan Stevens) in the new version! I have to say, that for me- their eyes are one of the first things I notice- and his eyes in no way entice me!!  Ironically, Mr. Davies steals Mr. Darcy's ""fine eyes"" line  (from Pride & Prejudice) and inserts this as one of Marianne's lines (after her 1st encounter with Willoughby).As for the ""more than the common gracefulness"" bit- Was it just me or did the poor chap look like he was about to have a hernia lifting Marianne?! (the grunt and gasp when he put her down didn't help either).  I'm NOT implying that the actress that played Marianne was overweight; just that he's not a tall strapping fellow that can pick any woman up with ease.  Which is what one would expect Mr. Willoughby to be!  (An excerpt from the San Francisco Cronicle/ SFGate article entitled ""PBS airs adaptations, old and new, of all Jane Austen's novels""states the following: 'Dominic Cooper recalled the hash he made initially of one of the novel's most romantic moments -- when his character, the ""uncommonly handsome"" Willoughby, rescues Marianne Dashwood after she slips and twists her ankle running down a hill.  The torrential rain ""did make it quite difficult picking her up from a 90-degree angle on a wet, greasy, green hill and turning back to walk up the hill with a very long, wet coat on,"" Cooper recalls. ""When I kind of squatted down, the jacket got caught. I fell over immediately and put her head in a ditch."")Finally, nothing about his acting or portrayal excited me.  Greg Wise will always be the perfect Willoughby to me!- I still maintain that Kate Winslet is the best Marianne!  When she acts- she becomes the character! She has so much feeling and depth!!I also like the Sir John Middleton and Mrs. Jennings in the '95 version better- very comical!I'm not entirely displeased with the casting of all the actors/actresses though! In fact, I quite like the new Edward Ferrars (played by Dan Stevens)!The new Col. Brandon is more of a convincing 35 yr. old than Alan Rickman.  But it's still too early yet to tell if I like his acting.Elinor isn't half bad either, she's more of a convincing 20 yr. old than Emma Thompson.  And I have to say, there are times when she sounds a lot like Emma too!  However, I still love Emma as an actress.I also like the new Mrs. Dashwood (Janet McTeer; she played lead actress in ""The Black Velvet Gown"")._____________________________________________________________________Pt. 2:- So I'm not going to go so far as to say ""I'm eating my words""- but I will say that after seeing all the other latest reproductions (Persuasion, Northanger Abbey, and Mansfield Park)- Sense & Sensibility is the best out of the four!  Maybe because this version is 3 hrs., whereas, the other three were 1 hr. 20 min.  Or maybe due to the fact that Mr. Davies has more experience in the adaptation/reproduction department (FYI: He's the script writer for other Jane Austen works.. Pride & Prejudice '95, Emma -'96 TV version, Northanger Abbey '07)I still have the same opinion of what I said earlier.  I don't like this version quite as much as the '95 one.  For the reasons (to recap):1.) An integral part of the plot was given away before it should have.  Which in my opinion lessened the impact that the actual event was supposed to inflict on the reader/viewer.  2.) The choice of actor who portrayed Willoughby.  3.) This lacked the humor the '95 one had.  And if you're familiar with Miss Austen's style of writing- she's very witty! (case in point: Mr. & Mrs. Bennet, and Mr. Collins in Pride & Prejudice).Thankfully Mr. Davies included in this version an important scene from the book that the '95 one omitted. (**Spoiler Alert**: Willoughby's attempt at redemption: The conversation between Willoughby and Elinor just after he married.)  He (Davies) also made a point to include the rest of the (smaller) characters in the book which the '95 left out.  (*Spoiler*) And to bring to life a subtle mention of a dual between Col. Brandon and Willoughby.  Although it has been said that it most likely would have been a pistol draw rather than a sword fight.  ...It reminded me a bit of P&P; '95, in which they show Mr. Darcy working out his frustration of rejection by fencing.  And I do believe that in Northanger Abbey '07 there's a dream sequence in which Miss Morland's two suitors are dueling it out with swords.  I guess Mr. Davies loves sword fighting!- Also, I was pleased in the acting of David Morrissey (Col. Brandon). More so than Alan Rickman though? I'd say they're pretty even; although as I said earlier- David was a more convincing 35 yr. old.On the whole, this is well worth watching if you're a fan of Jane Austens works; or if you like period/costume drama's in general!",4,The Best of the Latest ('07/'08) JA Adaptations...,1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,5962,"['have', 'admit', 'went', 'bit', 'prejudiced', 'opinion', 'Partly', 'what',

1138060,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B0012OVCE6,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[2, 2]","I've recently been on a Jane Austin kick, and in browsing for titles found that for most of the favorite novels--at least my favorites--there are two, three and sometimes even more cinematic versions to be found.  Like Little Women,Little Women (Unabridged Classics), almost every generation seems to need to see its own favorite actresses in the roles.  There are at least four versions of the latter,Little Women (1933)(Katherine Hepburn),Little Women(June Allyson),Little Women(Meredith Baxter Berny), andLittle Women (Collector's Series)(Susan Sarrandon).  Having watched the Emma Thompson edition ofSense & Sensibility (Special Edition), I decided to view this one as well.The filmography is quite good, as one has come to expect it to be with this type of production.  The English scenery is haunting and exquisite, the manor homes made intimate despite their size by candle light evenings of extended family gathered around the spinet.  Even large parties seem ""private"" under this illumination.  The costumes are somewhat less brilliant than some of those I've seen in other films of the Victorian Era, but still quite good.  They definitely reflect the differences between the generations well.The actors, while not quite as front line as those in the Emma Thompson version, are quite skilled in their rendering of each character, and while I feel that those of the latter are more charismatic in their interpretation--Huge Grant, for instance, is the quintescentual Edward--those of the former are probably more realistic with respect to the period and to the author's original intent.  The Dominic Cooper Willoughby is portrayed as far less a ""star crossed"" lover who is to be pittied, as he is in the Thompson film, nor is there any sense that he suffers any real anguish of loss.  Here he is a selfish, self-seeking opportunist willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to enjoy the lifestyle to which he has always been accustomed--though with the alternative, who can really blame him?  While we understand the Willoughby in this film, we don't necessarily like, forgive or sympathize with him.  I think this was the author's intent.  She wanted us to see the predicament of wealth without joy or happiness other than through dissipation, and the disaster of life without any secure income. Certainly this put into high relief the circumstances of Edward, whose character though honest and morally upright faced prospects of utter ruin and a life with which he was ill prepared to deal. One is left wondering if he is stupid or crazy; in short we are wondering about the sanity of Edward but equally critical of the selfish behavior of Willoughby.  There is no doubt in the reader/viewer's mind that these individuals are held hostage by society just as much as the women are.This rendition of the novel seems to have less levity to it.  Everything is far more serious, than the Thompson film is. Charity Wakefield's Marianne's risky behavior, though less flamoyant than the Kate Winslet Marianne, is seen much more clearly here as the threat to her reputation and marital future that it is.  Her indiscretions are small and innocent compared to those of the Winslet version, but they reveal to the modern audience just how little it took to actually bring ones behavior into question.  The Winslet Marianne would have been way off the chart for a contemporary audience.  While a modern audience will see a willful girl of 15 or 16 in love, acting out as adolescents so frequently do, the contemporary audience would have seen an imprudent and reckless young woman throwing away her future and that of her sisters in a world where society could be brutal in its ostracism of any woman whose potential off-spring might inherit considerable sums of land, property, and capital.  These rules were well known and well understood both by the author and by her contemporary readers.  While a married woman who'd provided her legal spouse with an ""heir and a spare"" might dally with other men and often did, until she had married and done her legal duty, she was under the social microscope.  Reputation was thus everything to an unmarried woman.  Maryanne's behavior would have put her own future on the line along with that of both her sisters Eleanor and Margaret.Since there were few men with large fortunes of which to dispose, the competition for them was intense, with the wealthy and aristocratic young women seen as front runners for the prizes available to each generation.  The Dashwood girls' sister-in-law Fannie Dashwood was a personification of just such an heiress.  She is played skillfully and with restraint here by Claire Skinner in keeping with the emotive ambiance of the version, but with much greater flamboyance and comedic skill by Harriet Walter in the Thompson version.  Successful in her own generation, she had fished for and caught the girls' brother, heir to the Dashwood fortune, and expected to reap the benefits of having done her ""duty,"" here represented by the little red headed boy in the film.  By eliminating her husband's ""burden"" of unmarried sisters by driving them out of the house they had been born in and by assuaging his conscience over his failure to do as his dying father had requested--sort of ""out of sight out of mind""--she ensured that her own son would inheret an intact estate.All of this marital maneuvering led to the famous ""season"" in London with its parties presenting for inspection the young women just ""coming out"" each year like so many fine horses for sale to the highest bidder. Fannie is at the ball where Maryanne humiliates herself over Willoughby to make certain her beloved brothers Edward and Robert meet appropriate potential marriage partners.  She has already made it plain to her mother-in-law and to the audience that Edward's inheritance is predicated on his marriage to a woman acceptable to his mother, played with great effect by Jean Marsh ofUpstairs, Downstairs - Collector's Edition Megaset (The Complete Series plus Thomas and Sarah)fame.  This makes it obvious that the duty to keep the family fortunes out of the hands of ""unsuitable"" connections was the responsiblity of everyone in the family, especially the women.  That she is right in her suspicion of their vulnerability is obvious to the reader/viewer because they already know that Edward has secretly betrothed himself to Lucy Steele, played demurely by Anna Madeley in this version and with greater comedic Machiavellianism by Imogine Stubbs in the Thompson film,  while a student at the girl's father's school.Less affluent women of various degrees, like the Dashwood and Steele sisters and like the betrayed ward of Colonel Brandon, relied upon beauty, talent, virtue, family connection, or pure guile to enter the marriage race and with varying degrees of success.  Both versions of the film reveal that it was the responsibility of extended family, especially the women, to find suitable husbands for these unmarried women. Hence the enthusiastic response of the Mrs. Jennings of both versions of the film.  Some of these young women were destined to marry the younger sons of wealthy families who were themselves destined for careers in the military or the church and who might inherit small legacies from their family but would essentially earn an income from their professions, keeping them at least in the lower ranks of the upper class.  A churchman might actually inherit a benefice offered by the estate of the family of which he was a part and do very little by means of actual labor.  Edward's ultimate destiny reflects this aspect of society when he receives a benefice from the estate of Colonel Brandon.  The importance of these profurements and the competition for them, especially in the church, can clearly be seen in Trollope's Barchester Chronicals (excellantly filmed inThe Barchester Chronicleswith Donald Pleasence).  Those with fewer prospects were reduced to making secret liasons, like Lucy Steele, or granting sexual favors like Colonel Brandon's ward.  That this sometimes met with success is personified by the wiley Lucy and sometimes with disaster by the betrayed ward of the Colonel.In such circumstances innuendo and gossip could be wielded like a battle axe by contenders in the marriage market to damage or even destroy the chances of an opponent, and once damaged the lady was all but unmarketable and fell back on her family as a dependant and burden forever.  Nor was the character of just one daughter with a damaged reputation the only victim, since her fate put that of all of her unmarried sisters into question as well, effectively removing them for the sweepstakes.  This is made even clearer by the Austin novel Pride and Prejudice,Pride And PrejudiceandPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996), when younger sister Lydia runs off with (another) unconscienced Willoghby and the Bennet family feels it encumbant upon themselves to withdraw from society altogether, until Mr. Darcy comes to their rescue.  Families were well aware of the consequences of such damage and took precautions against it, while those of young eligible bachelors took even greater care to keep their heirs out of the hands of ""unsuitable"" women.All of this ""survival of the fittest"" activity was bread and butter to Jane Austin, who was herself part of the lower ranks of upper class society.  She presents for gentle ridicule a system that leaves women no options for their continued well being except a ""good"" marriage or the kindness of well-disposed brothers, fathers and other male relatives--the latter group having been her own solace until her death at 41.All of these rules are made plain to the audience through the stereotypical characters in the novel and are well portrayed in this film version of it.",4,A more realistic version of life at the time,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,9804,"[""'ve"", 'recently', 'been', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'kick', 'browsing', 'titles', 'found',

But other than the out of place, completely unnecessary bodice-ripper scene in the very beginning, I liked it even better than the earlier version.  The casting is much more appropriate- age wise and better in capturing the characters.  The only one I didn't like was Willoughby- he wasn't at all what I would picture (the original one was much better- tall dark, and very handsome).  The actor who played Willoughby here was not dream-man worthy--I'm sorry but he reminded me of a hobbit, being so short and so much hair...  I loved the casting of Margaret; she was fun and spunky- oftentimes the comic relief.  Such a great actress for a young girl! The best favorite casting to me, though, was the actor who played Edward.  Now there's a dreamy specimen.  Hugh Grant is all right but he was too old to play Edward, as Emma Thompson was too old to play Elinor.  And I for one was very happy with the new Col. Brandon.  After seeing Alan Rickman as Snape in Harry Potter- I can't see him as a dashing hero, at all.  He never seemed that right for the part anyway.  At least here I can better see why Marianne would fall in love with the good Colonel.Though there was the unfortunate added scene in the beginning of a Willoughby seduction, there was also the bonus of an added scene of Brandon dueling with Willoughby.  This was an enjoyable fantasy to see, after Willoughby's treatment of Marianne and even poorer treatment of Brandon's ward, he definitely deserved a good thrashing.  We also got to see Brandon's ward, and in this movie I felt that her story was more complete feeling.  In Emma Thompson's S&S;, Anne was just mentioned, we never got to see her and hear anything from her personally, to better see her side of the story.Overall, Andrew Davies' Sense and Sensibility is a very loyal adaptation of the book, one definitely worth purchasing. I was very excited when Masterpiece announced it was doing the complete Jane Austen.  And this installment, ended the series on a very good note.  Enjoy!P.S. In regards to Miss Austen Regrets, I tried to watch it but just couldn't get into it.  It was a bit on the boring side. I mostly watched it in fast-forward... I really enjoyed the movie Becoming Jane so didn't really feel the need or desire to watch something of a similar vein. Those interested in watching Jane's eternal singledom and the how's and the why's would be more interested than I was. I'd liked to think that she had at least some happiness in her love life. Otherwise how could she create such wonderful characters with real emotions and strong affections if she herself had not felt the same feelings? Especially since these characters have been able to stand the test of time and remain real portrayals of love even today.",5,Just ignore the first scene and it's a 5 star film,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,2861,"['Having', 'enjoyed', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'was', 'little', 'wary', 'watching', 'new', 'version', 'other', 'out', 'place', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'bodice-ripper', 'scene', 'very', 'beginning', 'liked', 'even', 'better', 'earlier', 'version', 'casting', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate-', 'age', 'wise', 'better', 'capturing', 'characters', 'only', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Willoughby-', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'picture', 'original', 'one', 'was', 'much', 'better-', 'tall', 'dark', 'very', 'handsome', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Willoughby', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'dream-man', 'worthy', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'reminded', 'hobbit', 'being', 'so', 'short', 'so', 'much', 'hair', 'loved', 'casting', 'Margaret', 'was', 'fun', 'spunky-', 'oftentimes', 'comic', 'relief', 'great', 'actress', 'young', 'girl', 'best', 'favorite', 'casting', 'though', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Edward', 'Now', 'dreamy', 'specimen', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'all', 'right', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'Edward', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'Elinor', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'new', 'Col.', 'Brandon', 'seeing', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'Harry', 'Potter-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'dashing', 'hero', 'never', 'seemed', 'right', 'part', 'anyway', 'least', 'here', 'can', 'better', 'see', 'why', 'Marianne', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'good', 'Colonel.Though', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'added', 'scene', 'beginning', 'Willoughby', 'seduction', 'was', 'also', 'bonus', 'added', 'scene', 'Brandon', 'dueling', 'Willoughby', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'fantasy', 'see', 'Willoughby', 'treatment', 'Marianne', 'even', 'poorer', 'treatment', 'Brandon', 'ward', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'good', 'thrashing', 'also', 'got', 'see', 'Brandon', 'ward', 'movie', 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'complete', 'feeling', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'S', 'S', 'Anne', 'was', 'just', 'mentioned', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'hear', 'anything', 'personally', 'better', 'see', 'side', 'story.Overall', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'very', 'loyal', 'adaptation', 'book', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'Masterpiece', 'announced', 'was', 'doing', 'complete', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'installment', 'ended', 'series', 'very', 'good', 'note', 'Enjoy', 'P.S', 'regards', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Regrets', 'tried', 'watch', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'bit', 'boring', 'side', 'mostly', 'watched', 'fast-forward', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'need', 'desire', 'watch', 'something', 'similar', 'vein', 'interested', 'watching', 'Jane', 'eternal', 'singledom', 'how', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'was', ""'d"", 'liked', 'think', 'had', 'least', 'happiness', 'love', 'life', 'Otherwise', 'how', 'could', 'create', 'such', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'real', 'emotions', 'strong', 'affections', 'had', 'not', 'felt', 'same', 'feelings', 'Especially', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'remain', 'real', 'portrayals', 'love', 'even', 'today']",N/A

I've always been partial to Andrew Davies, so I admit I'm biased, but then I love Emma Thompson as well.Hattie Morahan and Charity Wakefield are EXCELLENT.  Wakefield's Marianne is right on par with Winslet's; there are no complaints from me on Wakefield's performance.  Her protestations when Elinor refuses Willoughby's gift of a horse and her slow-growing affection for Brandon are well done.I loved Hattie Morahan; she carried off the complexity of Elinor wonderfully.  She keeps an even keel throughout, so when Morahan delivers Elinor's angry retort to Willoughby at the end and Elinor rejoices with Marianne over Brandon's offer of marriage, it's all the more effective given the usual tight rein over her emotions.  I hate to sound shallow, but I will say that Morahan's youth worked better for me.  It's not that Thompson wasn't a fantastic Elinor, but when a visually young Elinor is more logical and thrifty than her own mother, the impact of her character is greater.  One sees how very young Elinor is and how quickly she must grow up.My favorite scene is at the end, where Marianne tells Elinor she has accepted Brandon's offer of marriage.  Beautifully written and beautifully acted, it sums up the changed Elinor and the changed Marianne perfectly.  Marianne has learned to look past herself - she sees Brandon for the excellent man he is and loves him, AND although she is bursting to tell her news, she is reluctant to hurt Elinor with her own happiness.  It's a beautiful, mature Marianne.  Elinor's concern for Marianne marrying for love is touching, but her humor is a fantastic touch - she jokes that ""I must get myself a colonel too!""I have to admit to being surprised with the male characters here.  I didn't like them, and I don't know why; I've always admired how Davies makes Austen's men very three-dimensional.  Davies' ""Northanger Abbey"", ""Emma"", and of course ""Pride and Prejudice"" did the men very well, I think.  It can't be the acting, at least not with David Morrissey as Brandon.  I just didn't quite get them, and I can't put my finger on why.  For some reason, the Bosco Hogan 1981 Edward Ferrars sticks in my mind.  These three, not so much.A very high point - this Edward is written MUCH better than the 1995.  Sorry, Ms. Thompson, but Edward was not a Regency version of the sweet, bumbling Hugh Grant.  (But that's a rant for another time.)I LOVED John Dashwood and his wife.  That comical opening where Fanny Dashwood talks John Dashwood down from his plans of generous help to his half-sisters is funny, and Davies does a fantastic job doing that couple.  It's clear that John does care very much for his half-sisters, but he's basically a spineless twit dominated by his wife - and what a wife!  Mark Gatiss is just so amusing to watch, and Claire Skinner is just so brilliant at being snide and rude.Miss Lucy Steele was done well, but it was her sister, Miss Steele, I remember when she accidentally blurts out that Lucy is engaged to Edward.  The entire scene is just brilliant - Fanny's furious, Mrs. Ferrars is furious, Miss Steele is blubbering away.  I laughed out loud - it was just too ridiculous and it was fantastic to see Lucy get her comeuppance in a major, public way.So, all in all, a very enjoyable production and the one I'd personally keep on hand.",4,"4.5, really",1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3455,"['Sense', 'Sensibility', 'been', 'sometimes', 'compared', 'unfavorably', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'earlier', 'S', 'S', 'personally', 'liked', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'partial', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'admit', ""'m"", 'biased', 'then', 'love', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'well.Hattie', 'Morahan', 'Charity', 'Wakefield', 'are', 'EXCELLENT', 'Wakefield', 'Marianne', 'right', 'par', 'Winslet', 'are', 'complaints', 'Wakefield', 'performance', 'protestations', 'when', 'Elinor', 'Willoughby', 'gift', 'horse', 'slow-growing', 'affection', 'Brandon', 'are', 'well', 'done.I', 'loved', 'Hattie', 'Morahan', 'carried', 'complexity', 'Elinor', 'wonderfully', 'even', 'keel', 'so', 'when', 'Morahan', 'Elinor', 'angry', 'retort', 'Willoughby', 'end', 'Elinor', 'rejoices', 'Marianne', 'Brandon', 'offer', 'marriage', 'more', 'effective', 'given', 'usual', 'tight', 'rein', 'emotions', 'hate', 'sound', 'shallow', 'will', 'say', 'Morahan', 'youth', 'worked', 'better', 'not', 'Thompson', 'was', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'Elinor', 'when', 'visually', 'young', 'Elinor', 'more', 'logical', 'thrifty', 'own', 'mother', 'impact', 'character', 'greater', 'One', 'how', 'very', 'young', 'Elinor', 'how', 'quickly', 'must', 'grow', 'up.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Marianne', 'Elinor', 'accepted', 'Brandon', 'offer', 'marriage', 'Beautifully', 'written', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'sums', 'up', 'changed', 'Elinor', 'changed', 'Marianne', 'perfectly', 'Marianne', 'learned', 'look', 'past', 'Brandon', 'excellent', 'man', 'bursting', 'tell', 'news', 'reluctant', 'hurt', 'Elinor', 'own', 'happiness', 'beautiful', 'mature', 'Marianne', 'Elinor', 'concern', 'Marianne', 'marrying', 'love', 'touching', 'humor', 'fantastic', 'touch', 'must', 'get', 'colonel', 'too', 'have', 'admit', 'being', 'surprised', 'male', 'characters', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""'ve"", 'always', 'admired', 'how', 'Davies', 'Austen', 'men', 'very', 'three-dimensional', 'Davies', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Emma', 'course', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'did', 'men', 'very', 'well', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'acting', 'least', 'not', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'Brandon', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'why', 'reason', 'Bosco', 'Hogan', '1981', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'mind', 'three', 'not', 'so', 'much.A', 'very', 'high', 'point', 'Edward', 'written', 'MUCH', 'better', '1995', 'Sorry', 'Ms.', 'Thompson', 'Edward', 'was', 'not', 'Regency', 'version', 'sweet', 'bumbling', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'rant', 'time', 'LOVED', 'John', 'Dashwood', 'wife', 'comical', 'opening', 'where', 'Fanny', 'Dashwood', 'talks', 'John', 'Dashwood', 'down', 'plans', 'generous', 'help', 'half-sisters', 'funny', 'Davies', 'fantastic', 'job', 'doing', 'couple', 'clear', 'John', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'half-sisters', 'basically', 'spineless', 'twit', 'dominated', 'wife', 'what', 'wife', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'just', 'so', 'amusing', 'watch', 'Claire', 'Skinner', 'just', 'so', 'brilliant', 'being', 'snide', 'rude.Miss', 'Lucy', 'Steele', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'was', 'sister', 'Miss', 'Steele', 'remember', 'when', 'accidentally', 'out', 'Lucy', 'engaged', 'Edward', 'entire', 'scene', 'just', 'brilliant', 'Fanny', 'furious', 'Mrs.', 'Ferrars', 'furious', 'Miss', 'Steele', 'blubbering', 'away', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'fantastic', 'see', 'Lucy', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'major', 'public', 'way.So', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'production', 'one', ""'d"", 'personally', 'keep', 'hand']",N/A

1138086,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0012OVCE6,D. S. Thurlow,"[7, 8]","2008's ""Sense and Sensibility"" is a charming new BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved romance novel by experienced screenwriter Andrew Davies.  Fans of the 1995 theatrical release starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslett will find nothing to dislike in this version, which at nearly three hours running time allows a more thorough retelling of the original novel.The storyline is familiar to Jane Austen fans.  Upon the death of their father, the three impoverished Dashwood sisters and their mother take up residence in a small cottage on the Devonshire coast.  The two older sisters, Elinor and Marianne, struggle with first loves.  Elinor cares for Edward Feres, a decent young man who seems to return her affection, but, for reasons that remain a mystery for the first half of the movie, does not propose to her.  Elinor hides her feelings and her disappointment from her family.  Marianne, headstrong and emotional, falls openly in love with John Willoughby, a charming but untrustworthy neighbor.  His sudden departure breaks Marianne's heart.  The two sisters will have to learn to balance sense and sensibility if they are to find happiness.The producers chose a terrific cast of actors close in age to their counterparts in the novel.  Hattie Morahan and Charity Wakefield are especially sympathetic as Elinor and Marianne.  Dan Stevens is excellent as the tortured Edward Feres, unable to speak his real feelings to Elinor until the climactic scene of the movie.  Dominic Cooper is charming and insidious as Willoughby, whose character flaws are fully revealed in this version.  David Morrissey is superb as Colonel Brandon, a gallant Army Officer with a mysterious past and an interest in Marianne.Davies succeeds in refreshing a familiar story.  Willoughby's seduction of Eliza, the ward of Col Brandon, opens the story.  Willoughby's duel with Brandon rates its own very dramatic scene, as does his apology to Elinor while Marianne lies ill.  The two social-climbing Miss Steele's get their full screen time.  Marianne's attraction to Col Brandon is given a fuller and more satisfying basis. Elinor's burdens as the practical but long-suffering eldest sister are fully explored.This new BBC version of ""Sense and Sensibility"" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen, who will find it faithful to the novel and refreshing in its approach to the material.  The DVD includes the excellent biopic ""Miss Austen Regrets"", featuring Oliva Williams in a highly sympathetic turn as Jane Austen.",5,A charming new Sense and Sensibility...,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2511,"['2008', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'charming', 'new', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'beloved', 'romance', 'novel', 'experienced', 'screenwriter', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'Fans', '1995', 'theatrical', 'release', 'starring', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'will', 'find', 'nothing', 'dislike', 'version', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'more', 'thorough', 'retelling', 'original', 'novel.The', 'storyline', 'familiar', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fans', 'death', 'father', 'three', 'impoverished', 'Dashwood', 'sisters', 'mother', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'small', 'cottage', 'Devonshire', 'coast', 'two', 'older', 'sisters', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'struggle', 'first', 'loves', 'Elinor', 'Edward', 'Feres', 'decent', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'return', 'affection', 'reasons', 'remain', 'mystery', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'not', 'propose', 'Elinor', 'feelings', 'disappointment', 'family', 'Marianne', 'headstrong', 'emotional', 'openly', 'love', 'John', 'Willoughby', 'charming', 'untrustworthy', 'neighbor', 'sudden', 'departure', 'Marianne', 'heart', 'two', 'sisters', 'will', 'have', 'learn', 'balance', 'sense', 'sensibility', 'are', 'find', 'happiness.The', 'producers', 'chose', 'terrific', 'cast', 'actors', 'close', 'age', 'counterparts', 'novel', 'Hattie', 'Morahan', 'Charity', 'Wakefield', 'are', 'especially', 'sympathetic', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'excellent', 'tortured', 'Edward', 'Feres', 'unable', 'speak', 'real', 'feelings', 'Elinor', 'climactic', 'scene', 'movie', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'charming', 'insidious', 'Willoughby', 'character', 'flaws', 'are', 'fully', 'revealed', 'version', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'superb', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'gallant', 'Army', 'Officer', 'mysterious', 'past', 'interest', 'Marianne.Davies', 'refreshing', 'familiar', 'story', 'Willoughby', 'seduction', 'Eliza', 'ward', 'Col', 'Brandon', 'story', 'Willoughby', 'duel', 'Brandon', 'rates', 'own', 'very', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'apology', 'Elinor', 'Marianne', 'ill', 'two', 'social-climbing', 'Miss', 'Steele', 'get', 'full', 'screen', 'time', 'Marianne', 'attraction', 'Col', 'Brandon', 'given', 'fuller', 'more', 'satisfying', 'basis', 'Elinor', 'burdens', 'practical', 'long-suffering', 'eldest', 'sister', 'are', 'fully', 'explored.This', 'new', 'BBC', 'version', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'faithful', 'novel', 'refreshing', 'approach', 'material', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'biopic', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Regrets', 'featuring', 'Oliva', 'Williams', 'highly', 'sympathetic', 'turn', 'Jane', 'Austen']",N/A

I agree with most reviews, will just mention where mine differs from majority.Comments on casting choices :Maryanne - young, beautiful, spirited, living for the moment - Charity embodied all that perfectly.  Kate Winslett was a brilliant Maryanne, but Charity wins in youth and beauty department.Colonel Brandon - head and shoulders above Alan Rickman.  As much as I love Alan as actor, he was a complete miscast in 1995.  Actually Alan cast as colonel is what really spoiled the 1995 version for me - such a travesty to have him paired up with Kate Winslett.  I can go on and on how I cannot fathom that choice, but I'll just say 2008 mini-series' colonel made it all right again, I could not be happier with him :)1995 and 2008 both had great Eleanor actresses.  However Hatty had no chemistry with Edward to speak of.  Physically she looked too plain, Emma Thompson was of course older, but much more attractive.2008 Willoughby I did not like at all.  ""Cheater"" written all over him, too obvious.  1995 Willoughby was awesome.Really enjoyed Mr and Mrs Palmer in 1995.  They are my favorite minor characters.  They are not even worth mentioning in 2008.I prefer 2008 Edward to Hugh Grant.  Hugh was just a bit too pathetic and awkward.  Though his interpretation was endearing and humorous, the 2008 actor came off more like what I imagined him from the book.I wish they never stop doing these adaptations.

Kate Winslet plays Marianne in the other version plays her in a very immature way, almost to immature, here Marianne is played by Charity Wakefield and she plays it  immaturely as well but not so much as age would allow. She is just a woman who fell in love and handled it all wrong, are we not all like that? I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I have read each of her books, and if there was a movie made I watched it.

This Sense & Sensibility is a little more rough-and-tumble and less polite than other versions in that it actually shows us the dark subplot that runs underneath the main storyline.  It is, however, still elegant, restrained, and well-scripted (thanks to Andrew Davies).  This adaptation is superior Ang Lee's, if not simply for the fact that extra running time is rarely a bad thing when adapting Austen for film.  When that extra running time is given to competent filmmakers (as is the case here), what you get is magic.If you're trying to choose between Ang Lee's version and this one, they're both fantastic.  I love watching Lee's version because Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Alan Rickman are just fantastic in it.  However, this one is truer to the book.

The changes and additions made to the basic plot structure are not malicious or radical.  The general essence of Jane Austen's moral universe still comes through.  Most of the acting I found very good.  The cinematography, sets and scenery were laudable as well.  The coastal setting for the Dashwood family's cottage was breathtaking.But this version is also definitely dumbed down compared to earlier filmed versions and of course the great book itself.  Clocking in at almost three hours, the film is longer than the famous version starring Emma Thompson.  Surprisingly, given its length, this newest adaptation has a less dense and detailed script, designed apparently for viewers with less interest in or attention for words, ideas and logical progression.  The three hours are filled with plenty of beautiful images to replace a demanding script.  While the film as mentioned above is faithful to the story in general, more dialogue could have resulted in a richer and deeper story.  The effort to spice the story up with the seduction scene opening did not impress me.But the film's merits vastly outweigh its demerits.

Unfortunately, this version pales so much in comparison to the old Emma Thompson version, that I can't say I like almost anything about it. The entire tone of the movie is dark and miserable. This director treats Austen more like Bronte! Even Mrs. Jennings, who ought to have been the comic relief, is just dull and meddlesome. The entire cast is plain in appearance and dull in character. So much so, that as the scenes change it is difficult to remember what each character looks like!  The actress playing Marianne is not a lovable romantic, but a brainless twit. Willoughby is not soft-spoken and charming, but an obvious womanizer. In whole, every character that Austen intended us to love is either too dull or too obvious for us to do so. As if all of that were not enough, the screen writer could not resist the urge to go against Austen's complex social code, and he resorts to inserting open class-warfare dialog. The tension between the Dashwoods and their step-sister Fanny was meant to be below the surface and entirely within the bounds of the Regency's facade of good manners, but the director has Mariann make an open speech in which she tells Fanny that she does deserve the house or the property. By breaking the ""silence of hatred"" she ruined entirely the suspense of the situation.In all, I highly recommend that you buy the Emma Thompson version.

I receive them very very quickly (same shipping time as when I order from here with free shipping), and I couldn't be happier.However, my version doesn't have Miss Austen Regrets with it.  That's a shame, because I'm wondering if I'll ever be able to see it! This version of Sense & Sensibility, though, is every bit as good than the 1995 Kate Winslet/Emma Thompson version.  Except that nobody, ever, can be as good as Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, this version is thoroughly entertaining.  And, this Colonel Brandon was really very good.  Had Alan Rickman not played the same role earlier, I would have been completely satisfied with this actor's portrayal and demeanor.The story follows the novel quite closely.  Lucy is portrayed a bit differently, but not much, and it works very well.  Both Marianne and Elinor are delightful to watch.  The acting is superb.  Edward, coincidentally (or maybe purposely) is almost a dead-ringer for Hugh Grant's Edward.Where the other version was awash in saturated colors, this version is a bit more subdued-- yet Marianne is still just as luminous and the countryside just as lush.This is gorgeously filmed and a complete delight from start to finish.

I was excited when I heard about this production because Andrew Davies always writes very strong screenplays and I always like and admire his work.  This was another fantastic screenplay and production.The story follows the lives of one family the Dashwoods.  Mrs. Dashwood's husband dies and all of his property and possessions goes to his only son from a previous marriage.  This leaves his three daughters and wife with really nothing.  The son wants to help his step-mother and sisters but his pernicious wife Fanny Dashwood quickly is able to talk him out of helping them.  From here the family is able to find a small cottage with a distant relative of Mrs. Dashwood.  At the heart of the story is Elinor Dashwood, the oldest and most responsible and level-headed character in the story.  She takes on most of the responsibility of seeing to the family's needs, she is very practical and is able to manage the family well.  When she meets Fanny Dashwood's eldest brother Edward Ferrars, they develop a deep attachment towards each other that Fanny tries and prevent.  Unfortunately, Edward never promises Elinor marriage or really speaks of his feelings for her because he is secretly engaged to another woman.  In contrast to Elinor, her sister Marianne is very impulsive, romantic and lets everyone see her real feelings.  Marianne and her family meet a friend of their cousin Colonel Brandon, who falls in love with Marianne despite the age difference.  Marianne does not love him but eventually falls in deep love with the dashing Willoughby.All of the important characters that were missing in the first version were in this one. Hattie Morahan is absolutely perfect as Elinor.  I always felt that Elinor was the center of the story and Hattie Morahan really hits the part well.  When I read the book I imagined someone exactly like her in this role.  I also really liked Dan Stevens as Edward Ferrars and I thought he portrayed the part well.  I especially liked Charity Wakefield as Marianne, I thought she captured the spirit and romantic nature of the character.  Her innocence sparkles.  Another great feature of this one is the scenery and locations picked in this production, they are wonderful.  I especially love the Dashwood's cottage, it really is a romantic wild place with the waves crushing onto the steep hills.  This movie is worth watching just for Adrew Davies screenplay.

I saw it as it was airing in the UK on a poor quality streaming video, only able to watch bits at a time between classes. I just couldn't wait for it to air here in the US. I was so disappointed and thought it was too dark and copied too much from the 1995 version, which I liked but was not entirely satisfied with (read my review to see why). It wasn't until I got the DVD this past Christmas that I noticed everything that made me like it. It was dark, yes, but it was only the bad quality of the stream that made it hard to see! I watched a behind-the-scenes video that they hadn't intended to make everything ""dark and stormy"" but there was bad weather all the time during filming and they decided to go with that look! As for the copying from the 1995 version, yes, there were some parts from it, not in the book, that Andrew Davies also included in this, and while I could definitely do without them, they don't stop me from enjoying the show! On my rewatch I noticed so many other things that made me love it!The main thing that I love about this movie is its wonderful (with a couple exceptions), more age-appropriate cast.

Willoughby made me want to smack him right from the beginning. I was Team Colonel Brandon from the start. He was my favorite character.

1138130,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B0012OVCE6,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[417, 429]","Jane Austen fans have reason to rejoice.  After a mixed repertoire of new Austen adaptations, BBC has done it again with a pleasurable, charming and faithful adaptation to ""Sense & Sensibility.""No doubt this version of `Sense & Sensibility' will be compared to the popular and well-loved 1995 film version starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. And it certainly has big shoes to fill.  After all, the 1995 version was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, won Emma Thompson a Best Adapted Screenplay award and catapulted then-unknown Kate Winslet to stardom.  And while that version sets the bar for all other versions that follow, even its most faithful fans would certainly admit that it did have its flaws. For one, at a 2-hour or so running time, the audience was treated to a few excised characters, the absence of some key scenes from the book and some actors who were noticeably too old for their roles.Nevertheless, I approached this new S&S; with some trepidation.  I felt that there was no way for this version to top (or even equal) the one from 1995.  Imagine my surprise when I found myself totally captivated by the end of this miniseries. While it started slowly, it became more and more enchanting as it went along and I found myself falling in love with most of the characters.Among its successes are as follows (WARNING - SPOILERS GALORE!!):1 - A strong screenplay by Andrew Davies. After penning the screenplay to such period drama favorites as the 1995 ""Pride & Prejudice"" (yes, the one with Colin Firth), ""Wives & Daughters,"" ""Middlemarch,"" ""Daniel Deronda"" and the new delightful ""Northanger Abbey,"" Andrew Davies is well-known among period drama fans.  This strong screenplay manages to stay true to the spirit and tone of the book and Davies successfully brings the novel to life.2 - Brilliant casting overall.  While there are a couple of lukewarm choices, this version has some of the best actors ever cast for S&S; roles.  Hattie Morahan, Dan Stevens and David Morrissey shine as Elinor, Edward Ferrars and Col. Brandon.  Jean Marsh is aptly haughty as Mrs. Ferrars; Daisy Haggard as Anne Steele is funny and very vulgar; Margaret is bright and delightful; and Janet McTeer lends a certain elegance to Mrs. Dashwood.  Unlike the 1995 version, the actors here are closer in age to their book counterparts. While Emma Thompson was 36 when she played 20-year old Elinor, Hattie Morahan is 28 (and could pass for 22). Hattie Morahan's intelligent, warm and brilliant turn as Elinor makes her the heart and soul of this story.  And I would be very surprised if the ladies in the audience do not fall in love with either Dan Stevens or David Morrissey (or even Dominic Cooper) by the time the credits roll.3 - Perhaps the most faithful version of the book to date.  This version includes all the major and minor characters from the novel, including Lady Middleton, Mrs. Ferrars, Anne Steele and even Col. Brandon's unfortunate ward Eliza (who were all absent in the 1995 version).  The actors chosen also closely resemble their characters in age and appearance.  And at a 3-hour running time, there is enough time to cover scenes that were missing from the 1995 version as well as develop the characters and their relationships with each other.  Some vital scenes that were omitted from the earlier version are also here, including the meeting with the imperious Mrs. Ferrars, the wonderfully awkward scene where Edward is confronted by his mother regarding his secret engagement (which was only talked about in previous versions) and Willoughby's visit to the Palmer's estate in Cleveland. We are shown Allenham (the estate of Willoughby's aunt) and Col. Brandon's estate, Delaford.  The plot closely follows what is in the book and some minor added scenes like the duel between Col. Brandon and Willoughby do not take away from the spirit of the book (some might argue that it evens adds a new dimension to the characters. Besides, who wouldn't want a chance to see more of David Morrissey's Brandon?).4 - Beautiful scenery and locations.  The mansions are aptly grand and stately - namely Norland, Barton Park, Cleveland, Delaford and Allenham - and the Dashwood's cottage is humble and small but situated in a spectacular and romantic location amidst hills and crashing waves.5 - Overall excellent production values.  While the recent slew of ITV Jane Austen adaptations had lower budgets, this has the high production values one would expect from the company that gave us the 1995 ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""North & South,"" ""Wives & Daughters"" and the upcoming treasure trove of British acting greats - ""Cranford"" (based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel.  Watch for it in April 2008, US period drama fans!!).  The score, for one, is lovely and I applaud the location managers for finding such wonderful and appropriate locations and settings. (It is truly a shame that ""Northanger Abbey,"" ""Persuasion"" and ""Mansfield Park"" did not get quite the same treatment. Only think of how much better these would have been at higher budgets and a 3 or 4-hour running time).I can count very few shortcomings because I feel that the production team and cast really hit the nail in the head with this one.  Some people may not like the fact that this version is more dramatic and not as funny and lighthearted as the 1995 version but I feel that the tone of this version is appropriate.  The only things I can find fault with are the casting of Dominic Cooper as Willoughby and Charity Wakefield as Marianne. I have a great fondness for Greg Wise from the 1995 version. He is exactly what I would picture Willoughby to be - tall, handsome, charming and dashing - so Dominic just falls short of this (he would have made a perfect Henry Crawford (""Mansfield Park"") though).  And while I eventually warmed to Charity Wakefield's portrayal of Marianne, it does not quite compare to Kate Winslet's luminous and memorable performance.So Jane Austen and period drama fans have reason to be hopeful. Those who were disappointed with the recent versions of ""Persuasion"" and ""Mansfield Park"" have something to look forward to.  ""Sense and Sensibility"" is at least as good as (if not better than) the 1995 version and I believe that this will delight Janeites and British drama fans of all ages.  This will definitely hold a special place in my British drama dvd collection.So how does this compare to the other new adaptations?  To me, this almost ties (or is a close second to) ""Northanger Abbey"" and is much better than ""Persuasion"" and ""Mansfield Park."" And if you enjoyed PBS Masterpiece's `Complete Jane Austen,' be on the lookout for ""Cranford"" (starring acting greats Judi Dench, Michael Gambon, Eileen Atkins, Francesca Annis, Imelda Staunton and Leslie Manville - and former Austen drama alumni Simon Woods, Greg Wise and Julia Sawalha) coming in May on PBS.",5,A faithful and charming version that period drama fans will enjoy!,1200787200,"01

In both films, the 1995 and the BBC production, I find myself remembering why, the character is played by two men who are both powerful in presence but who have a softness to them.  The fact that in previous movies they have played villians actually adds to this unexpected goodness in this role, Rickman in Die Hard/Robin Hood and David Morrissey in The Reaping.  Oh, they are both handsome too.  I have to say that I loved both Elinors, this version's was more of what I have always imagined, so solid and with a good head on her shoulders.  I prefer Winslet's Marianne somewhat but I like the fact that in the end the BBC's Marianne showed that sober side more so than 1995's.  It is somewhat more serious than 1995's version but that is one of the things that I liked most about it, its a sad story for the most part much like Persausion, these girls are penniless for the most part and their destinies are very much uncertain.  I love this one for its detail and the fact that they go into more detail about the Misses Steele and Mrs. Ferrars.  I have to say that there is one thing that I didn't like about this version and that was Willoughby, that guy was seriously unattractive, seriously, when I think of Willoughby I think of someone so dangerously handsome that you can't help but want to run off with him.  I do like that they go into the story of Col. Brandon's ward more, and don't write her off.  I love that they show how Marianne becomes most ardently attached to Col. Brandon in the end, like  I said he has always been my favorite character of all the Austen novels, this film lets through the agony of what he went through and what he gained.  I loved the duel scene, it was just what I wanted to happen, to see Willoughby brought to account for all his wrong doing.  Speaking of which the fact that there is the scene when Willoughby comes back to explain what happened between he and Marianne, I love that scene, it actually brought me to tears.  I have always been more Elinor than Marianne, I have no real romantic notions, but I felt badly for her everytime that I read this novel.  I sort of wanted a final scene that denoted what Austen wrote at the end of the novel, that the sisters lived in close enough proximity to visit one another most frequently, perhaps a dinner scene with all the Dashwood girls their husbands and mother and younger sister.  I think that you have to go into this movie not ready to compare it to the earlier version but to love it for what it is.

The attempts to ""improve"" on the original are unsuccessful and occasionally absurd (the opening seduction scene and the duel). You mess with Miss Austin at your peril. A cast of good actors doing a great job doesn't hide the fact that many have faces that do not fit, altho' Hattie Morahan makes a terrific Elinor and Lucy Boynton is good as Margaret. The production values are up to the BBC's usual high standard, but I rate this version well behind those of 1981(BBC) and 1995 (Emma Thomson).The product includes ""Miss Austin Regrets"", where JA nearing middle age is called upon to give advice on men, love and marriage to her young niece Fanny, a theme too slender to carry a whole film. Pity we weren't given more of JA's earlier life. A missed opportunity, but much better than the dire ""Becoming Jane"".The extras are excellent: a commentary (apparently, I couldn't play it), a good (if short) photo gallery, an entertaining interview with Andrew Davies and producer Anne Pivcevic and especially an audio narration (""Remembering Jane Austin"") of JA's life, based on the memoir of her nephew J.E.

Having loved the 1995 version with Emma Thompson's well deserved screenplay Oscar and Ang Lee's brilliant directing, why another version? Three reasons: Flush out more details with nearly three hours, let Andrew Davies(the all time champ of 'Costume dramas/romances' or anything he adapts) have a go at it, and because we can't get enough.I found myself naturally, and probably unfortunately, comparing the 2 versions, here are the standouts: both screenplays are exceptional.  Andrew has the advantage of hindsight and more screen time to create freshness in a well known and loved classic.  On the special features, he and the producer discuss how they wanted to advance it.  The man is a genius and a hoot of a talker.  He added scenes not in the book, but they fit perfectly, e.g., Elinor's and Edward's first meeting, a fun, playful flirting which catches the heroine a bit off guard.The scenery is to lust after and long for in both, but I prefer the stark, oceanside dwelling, which the girls are forced to endure, better in the 2008 film.  The sets and costumes are all first rate, and the expanded shots and attention to detail are equally rewarding.Now with actors it becomes tricky, a matter of taste, and at times personal like politics.  Overall, both versions compared well.  Hattie Morahan is fantastic.  She speaks with her eyes, restraining her emotions, constantly holding back.  A difficult task for an actor especially when everyone else gets to be flamboyant.  I love Emma Thompson, no disregard.  I believe Kate Winslet a better younger sister, and the two Margarets are just wonderful- in this version, she definitely stands out in humor and cutes.  The new Edward is better; although at times, I kept seeing Hugh Grant's portrayal but with more depth; Greg Wise(1995) is the epitome of Willoughby(Davies added an interesting confrontation between him and Elinor near the end) and the new Colonel is more human although both are stiffish and a bit old as appropriately written.  The remaining cast for both movies are super; it's a wash which are better.Which ending?  I love what Emma Thompson does in the older one, but the new one is very satisfying and similar.Which is overall supreme?  If you've got the time, don't want to be rushed and want more details including missing characters not seen in the 1995 version than it's the 2008 version by an English nose.

Lucas,"[9, 10]","I couldn't help compare this to the earlier version of Sense and Sensibility which won Emma Thompson an Oscar and starred Hugh Grant, Kate Winslet, Greg Wise, and a slew of other wonderful actors.  Although the actors are much more age appropriate in this Masterpiece Theater version, I thought that the performances left something to be desired by comparison.  I felt also that many scenes were played out almost identically to the earlier version, but with less success. The production all in all had a very melancholly feeling to it with very little to smile about.  The portrayals of Willoughby, Marrianne, and Edward Ferrars were weak.  The actor who played Edward was very similar to Hugh Grant, who played him in the old version, so much so that I even thought they looked alike.  The only difference is that Hugh Grant came off as an awkward sometimes nervous but still likeable character with plenty of witty lines, while the new Edward simply seemed dull.  Hardly the object for all of our women to be pining after.  Willoughby simply didn't look enough the part for me, and Marrianne simply couldn't stand up to Kate Winslet's portrayal of the same character.  With that said, there are still wonderful sets and a few characters from the book which had been ommitted from Emma Thompson's screenplay. And those characters added some color.  As I said earlier, overall, the actors were much closer in age to the characters of the book. There were several scenes which were missing from the earlier one that were enjoyable in this new version.  The main reason I bought this is because of the bonus feature ""Miss Austen Regrets"" which I enjoyed very much.  Although I am sure a lot of it had to be invented, it covers only the last couple of years of Jane Austens life.  The portrayal of Jane was exactly how I imagined the real Jane to be: smart, witty, independent of spirit, and trapped in a time when it wasn't convenient to be any of those things.

I really could not imagine anyone topping Emma Thompson's prior version which is a favorite of mine but this new take on the story equalled if not surpassed it.I thought that the male characters were especially well done in this version. Edward Ferrars and Colonel Brandon seemed stronger and more masculine. Willowby was both more charming and more despicable. There were several scenes added which made the story so much richer. For example, the movie begins with Willowby's seduction of a young girl which has far reaching consequences later in the story. Edward has his own wet shirt scene while chopping wood, and Colonel Brandon seemed to have much more depth and self-possession.I also loved the scene in the carriage near the end when Marianne reflects on the hard lessons she has learned about life and love. She tells her sister and mother she has learned that a 'romantic' is not defined by just words or feelings but more by actions. She says Colonel Brandon is the true romantic because he remained faithful to the woman he loved even after she was gone. This scene proves that Marianne has grown and is becoming the kind of person who will be able to find love not just infatuation.

Perhaps the fact that I'm an avid Jane Austen fan is the main reason--I like my films to be accurate to the books, and this one is definitely much more so than the older version.  Yes, I do like the other version a lot, but this one is wonderful because it tells the S&S; story very accurately.  The characters are all their ages that they are in the book, and this film follows the book story line better.  I think the actors and actresses are very good in their roles and put on believable performances.  And the scenery is AMAZING.  I almost wanted to redo the entire theme of my house to an ocean theme.  Plus, this film is longer than the older one, so there's more time to enjoy it!  Only one objectionable scene at the very beginning when Willoughby (a male character) is seducing a young girl.  You don't see more than fingertips, bare skin, and clothing being untied--all illuminated by a fire's glow.  The scene is right at the beginning, so you can fast forward it if you have younger ones in the room.Also, ""Miss Austen Regrets"" is another good addition to your movie shelf.  I like it much better than the Anne Hathaway film ""Becoming Jane"".  This movie follows Jane Austen in her later life after she becomes well-known for her novels.  It deals a little bit with her love life, but not very much.  If I had to pick any film that I would say, ""This portrays what I think Jane Austen was really like!"", this film would be it.

1138151,AMAOS41TZ1V89,B0012OVCE6,Price Grisham,"[6, 10]","After viewing this edition again on PBS, I realized why I prefer the Emma Thompson version of it, as well as the A&E; version of P&P;: The earlier editions understand and convey that Austen's works were written PRIMARILY as COMEDIES of manners, and only SECONDARILY as romances--and the newest versions are just not humorous, no matter how well they are otherwise produced.While not quite as faithful (and thus as good) as Northanger Abbey, this new makeover of Sense & Sensibility is far superior to Persuasion (gentle Anne Elliot would have never gone tearing through the streets of Bath without a coat and bonnet, gasping after her lover), and far, far superior to Mansfield Park (where most of the characters are completely changed from Austen originals, especially Fanny--to have a shy, reticent, and religious heroine would be SO politically incorrect).The two lead actresses here (whoops, we say actors now for all of them, don't we?) were absolutely perfect in appearance and personality, especially Eleanor, who had the harder job: Her character traits of prudence and self-control are not popular in our pseduo-Romantic culture, so Miss Morahan deserves huge applause for making Eleanor's character simultaniously accurate and sympathetic.The other ""politcally correct"" obligations were there, however: having the ladies bemoan male oppression (which is much more discreetly shown in the novels), and allowing not even the modicum of sympathy for Willowby at the end which Austen herself permitted: After his dramatic visit in the novel, Eleanor allows herself to think of him as ""poor Willowby."" Austen's original presentation of the scene is better, as well--No servant would have simply told Eleanor that ""a gentleman is asking about you downstairs"" without getting a name, a situation Austen handled in her superbly suspenseful version by having Eleanor rush downstairs under the impression (along with the reader) that the noise in the entrance is from her mother.Nor would Marianne, still a very young girl, have been allowed to study and play alone in Col. Brandon's library without the company of her sister, mother, or a servant.While I thought Lucy Steele entirely too sweet and educated-sounding, her sister Nancy was wonderful, and Edward entirely believable (and appealing!) as a future clergyman. However, with the now usual ""tarting up"" of the screenplay (a hot seduction scene and some unnecessary dueling), you get a production that is very, very good, when it could have been fully excellent. Emma Thompson's screenplay was just that much better, because it was more understated, accurate, and humorous.Perhaps it is my flawed male perspective, but only Northanger Abbey of these new productions remembered that Austen's works were (and ARE) COMEDIES of manners, not Barbara Cortland regency romances. The fact that Austen's works been constantly studied and appreciated by scholars over the centuries of BOTH genders (not only women) points out this deft ability of hers to use humor in highlighting serious, moral insights.Thankfully, she remains an enigma in spite of some of academia--which presented her during the Victorian age as an ""obviously Christian"" writer and now during the post-modern era as an ""obviously feminist and possibily athiest"" writer (those of the latter view do not know that she wrote some deeply moving prayers, which, of course, are never reviewed). Victorians and post-modernists alike tend to overlook her sense of humor (and proportion). For all of that, this production was really good (one which will not disappoint Austen viewers who become Austen readers), and I hope we see the two young actress--er, actors (the female ones, formerly known as actresses) again soon!",4,"Comedies of manners?

The locations are breathtaking and so is the acting. The story portrays the Dashwood family, Mrs Dashwood and her three daughters who are forced to leave their beloved home, Norwood, when Mr.Dashwood dies,leaving Norwood to a male relative and his odious, social climbing wife. Their move from the palatial Norwood to a humble cottage by the sea is a shock at first, but the women, thanks to the influence of the eldest daughter, Elinor, quickly adjust to their new circumstances with grace and dignity. In time, both Elinor and her younger sister, the impulsive Marianne, fall in love with two very different men, Marianne with a rogue who seduces her and then abruptly leaves to engage himself to an heiress and Elinor with a man whom she believes returns her feelings but who, alas, is already engaged to another. The story portrays women of intelligence, grace, strength and moral courage who, through their trials, learn much about themselves and in the end, find true love. This story leaves you smiling and feeling that sometimes, the nice guy (or in this case, girl) wins.

And it wasn't. The reason the 95 version worked was because I actually liked the actors portraying the characters. Aside from the fact that I did think the woman who played Elinore was more suited in age than Emma T, the rest of the mini-series did nothing for me. Cnl. Brandon was AWFUL in this, I cringed every time he was on screen. I admit I am biased to Alan Rickman and his portrayal, but really, the man in this film was just so bland and emotionless. I also hated the portrayal of Mrs. Jennings here, it just paled in comparison to the woman in the 95 version. I did like the location of the cottage in this, I thought it was a very romantic looking setting. The one bright part of this mini-series that I must praise however is, Edward Ferres (sp?). The man playing him was just delightful and exactly how I pictured him when reading the novel. He did a wonderful job. However, for a 3 hour mini-series, we learned very little about the minor, but important characters; Lucy Steele, even the Palmers. Sad really, as Mr Palmer was a great character in the 95 version. So, while it was a fine enough adaption, for me anyway, it in no way can compare to the movie version.Miss Austen Regrets: Very surprising. Quite good, entertaining and the acting is wonderful. Its a bittersweet sort of film, but an interesting look into Austen's life, or as much of it as we know. The actress that portrays Austen really shines here and is very likable and relatable.

1138171,A2AGBL998D0FYY,B0012OVCE6,VReviews,"[2, 2]","Over a decade after Emma Thompson's Oscar winning adaption of Jane Austen's most popular novel, Sense & Sensibility; screen-writer Andrew Davies brought the story to television released as a mini-series through the BBC. Given the critical acclaim Thompson's adaption received, one can't help but make comparisons. However, just as with Shakespeare, the fascination and enjoyment often comes in the choices of how and which pieces of the story will be developed and in the skill of the acting.The choices made in this adaptation bring more detail to the genesis of the Dashwood's circumstances, and the past dubious indiscretions of the cad Willoughby. To hardcore aficionados of Jane Austen, the opening scene between the unidentified lovers may feel out of place, even awkward especially since Austen didn't pen such a scene, nor is it even close to 19th century sensibilities. However, if you forgive this odd beginning, what follows is a much more illustrative and informative picture of life for the Ladies Dashwood as it was prior to Mr. Dashwood's death, than previous adaptations have afforded.They lived in splendor, yet due to the inheritance laws of the time, they also lived in a precarious state of anxiety not knowing if or how their father's first born son would honor Mr. Dashwood's request to take care of his 2nd wife and daughters. The mini-series format was much better able to take the time to fully develop this part of the story, which really provides the dramatic grounding to Austen's emotional tale. For instance, the scenes in which John Dashwood and his conniving wife Fanny discuss what his promise to his late father really meant, was excellent in it's distastefulness. Just as the stark dichotomy between the majestic Dashwood home is juxtaposed against the bleak and clinging coastal cottage that the Dashwoods are reduced to. These scenes are not only included, but are detailed out beautifully allowing the audience to fully appreciate the change in circumstances of the Dashwoods, and their need not only emotionally, but financially to be married.The casting by Kate Rhodes James is stellar; except perhaps for Dominic Cooper as Willoughby whose slight-of-frame, roguish, modern boy charm doesn't quite transfer to the 18th century.  Subtle, yet purposeful directing by John Alexander lends a nuanced portrayal throughout. For example, Dan Stevens does a fine job in depicting the honorable and reserved, yet intelligent Edward Ferrars. This is an Edward who sees through his sister's insincere and mean-spirited discourse, and deflects the barbs thrown at the sisters Dashwood with a slight expression of the face, and perfectly placed word. His performance is more shaded and genuine than Hugh Grant's stammering and visibly conflicted Edward.The BBC has a long history of putting out top-notch period dramas, that along with multi-award winning writer Andrew Davies, and this glorious three-part/three hour format provides an enjoyable and entertaining immersion into Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility.",4,An Immersion in Jane Austen's World,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,3040,"['decade', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'adaption', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'most', 'popular', 'novel', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'screen-writer', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'brought', 'story', 'television', 'released', 'mini-series', 'BBC', 'Given', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'Thompson', 'adaption', 'received', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'comparisons', 'However', 'just', 'Shakespeare', 'fascination', 'enjoyment', 'often', 'choices', 'how', 'pieces', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'developed', 'skill', 'acting.The', 'choices', 'made', 'adaptation', 'bring', 'more', 'detail', 'genesis', 'Dashwood', 'circumstances', 'past', 'dubious', 'indiscretions', 'cad', 'Willoughby', 'hardcore', 'aficionados', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'opening', 'scene', 'unidentified', 'lovers', 'may', 'feel', 'place', 'even', 'awkward', 'especially', 'Austen', 'did', ""n't"", 'pen', 'such', 'scene', 'even', 'close', '19th', 'century', 'sensibilities', 'However', 'forgive', 'odd', 'beginning', 'what', 'much', 'more', 'illustrative', 'informative', 'picture', 'life', 'Ladies', 'Dashwood', 'was', 'prior', 'Mr.', 'Dashwood', 'death', 'previous', 'adaptations', 'have', 'afforded.They', 'lived', 'splendor', 'yet', 'due', 'inheritance', 'laws', 'time', 'also', 'lived', 'precarious', 'state', 'anxiety', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'father', 'first', 'born', 'son', 'would', 'honor', 'Mr.', 'Dashwood', 'request', 'take', 'care', '2nd', 'wife', 'daughters', 'mini-series', 'format', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'able', 'take', 'time', 'fully', 'develop', 'part', 'story', 'really', 'dramatic', 'grounding', 'Austen', 'emotional', 'tale', 'instance', 'scenes', 'John', 'Dashwood', 'conniving', 'wife', 'Fanny', 'what', 'promise', 'late', 'father', 'really', 'meant', 'was', 'excellent', 'distastefulness', 'Just', 'stark', 'dichotomy', 'majestic', 'Dashwood', 'home', 'juxtaposed', 'bleak', 'clinging', 'coastal', 'cottage', 'Dashwoods', 'are', 'reduced', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'included', 'are', 'detailed', 'out', 'beautifully', 'allowing', 'audience', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'change', 'circumstances', 'Dashwoods', 'need', 'not', 'only', 'emotionally', 'financially', 'be', 'married.The', 'casting', 'Kate', 'Rhodes', 'James', 'stellar', 'perhaps', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Willoughby', 'slight-of-frame', 'roguish', 'modern', 'boy', 'charm', ""n't"", 'quite', 'transfer', '18th', 'century', 'Subtle', 'yet', 'purposeful', 'directing', 'John', 'Alexander', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'example', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'fine', 'job', 'depicting', 'honorable', 'reserved', 'intelligent', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'Edward', 'who', 'sister', 'insincere', 'mean-spirited', 'discourse', 'barbs', 'thrown', 'sisters', 'Dashwood', 'slight', 'expression', 'face', 'perfectly', 'placed', 'word', 'performance', 'more', 'shaded', 'genuine', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'stammering', 'visibly', 'conflicted', 'Edward.The', 'BBC', 'long', 'history', 'putting', 'out', 'top-notch', 'period', 'dramas', 'multi-award', 'winning', 'writer', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'glorious', 'three-part/three', 'hour', 'format', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'immersion', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Sense', 'Sensibility']",N/A
1138172,A2RR4S9Z28BY5C,B0012OVCE6,Y movie buff,"[1, 1]","This is my favorite of all the new Jane Austen adaptations!  Dedicating almost 3 hours really does justice to the story line and of course having Andrew Davies writing the screen play certainly helps!In my opinion the actresses were really well chosen especially Eleanor & Marianne.  Eleanor (Hattie Morahan) is great, her thickly veiled unhappiness, is barely there, very subtle, but a scene of her alone by the sea manages to convey her distress in being separated from Edward.  I feel that the Eleanor played by Emma Thompson (in the 1996 movie version) was a bit too cold, distant and as many before me have commented , too old.  This Eleanor is youthful, shows a bit more feeling, emotion, and therefore comes across as more human. She is more likable and even though there is a space of 200 years, modern audiences can still relate to her.  Marianne's enthusiasm and passion is well captured by Charity Wakefield's performance.  Also, Col. Brandon is much younger in this version and more gallant!  The duel was an exciting touch!  The romance between Col. Brandon and Marianne is properly developed, where as in the movie version all happened too suddenly.  A lot that was left out in the movie version, is finally shown (Willoughby's confrontation w/Eleanor, lots of characters in the book were included in this version) Fanny Dashwood is so thoroughly evil, the perfect snob!The rented cottage and it's surrounding landscapes are breathtaking, as is the various other locations.

1138173,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0012OVCE6,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","SENSE AND SENSIBILITYThis latest adaptation of Sense and Sensibility [2007] is a fine version indeed, with lush cinematography, a beguiling score, and credible, above average performances by the cast in general. I find that each adaptation of Austen's novel has something special to offer, and this latest is no different. Adapted by Andrew Davies, this is a first rate adaptation that is bound to be a beloved adaptation, up there with Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility [for which Emma Thompson received an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay].For those unfamiliar with the story - Sense and Sensibility revolves around two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who find themselves together with their mother and younger sister cast out of their family home, Norland, upon the death of Mr Henry Dashwood. As is the custom of the times, the estate passes on to his only son, John who is married to a real sly, snobbish, malicious woman, Fanny [ Claire Skinner in a truly wicked role].Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars [Dan Stevens] comes to visit and forms a close friendship with Elinor [Hattie Morahan] to the chagrin of his sister who makes it plain to Mrs Dashwood that such an alliance would be beneath Edward's station.The widow Dashwood and her daughters move to a little cottage let by a relative, Sir John Middleton, a kind yet gossipy man. Here, Marianne [Charity Wakefield] finds herself pursued by two men, the staid and noble Colonel Brandon [David Morissey] and the charming Romeo, Willoughby [Dominic Cooper]. Elinor and Marianne are two very different people, with Elinor being more in control of her emotions whereas Marianne is impulsive, utterly transparent in her emotions and wilful. The rest of the story deals with how these two sisters' romances play out.This adaptation is beautifully filmed, and there are some highlight performances. Hattie Morahan's Elinor is not only credible in her role age-wise, but also very nuanced as the quiet sister who feels just as much but is not as revealing in her emotions as her younger sister Marianne. As for Marianne, Charity Wakefield makes for a sweet, and wilful Marianne, but I found her performance less compelling than Kate Winslet's luminous and passionate portrayal of Marianne.David Morissey's Colonel Brandon is well done indeed, and though Alan Rickman's portrayal of the same role in the earlier version was wonderful, David Morissey's Brandon is no less compelling. Willoughby as played by Dominic Cooper didn't do anything for me - he just wasn't very credible, and at times came across as plain unpalatable, appearance-wise.Dan Steven's Edward Ferrars is very charming [though in the book he is not really outstanding in appearance] and I liked his portrayal better than Hugh Grant's in the 1995 version - Dan Steven's makes an amiable Edward and his chemistry with Hattie Morahan's Elinor is more credible than the Thompson-Grant pairing. Another character that I though was very well-done was Lucy Boyd's Margaret Dashwood - she is so adorable and her comments are always spot on ""Women just sit around and wait for things to happen..."". I love her performance in this adaptation, and understand that she is also in Ballet Shoes a British production that also stars Emma Watson.All in all, this is a well-made adaptation that stays as faithful as it can to Austen's novel, and is sure to attract fans of Jane Austen's novels as well as those who love period dramas. It is a quality show that is sure to please most Janeites.MS AUSTEN REGRETSThis perceptive and insightful new biopic focuses on the latter years of the famous author's life, and it makes for riveting viewing, though it is quite sad. Ms Austen's works continue to garner generations of new fans, yet she died at the age of 41 in 1817, unmarried and relatively poor [despite the positive reviews her works garnered].I had often wondered if Mr Darcy of P&P; had been modeled on a real-life character - here, that thought is put to rest as Ms Austen [played by a well-cast Olivia Williams] tells her niece Fanny Austen Knight ""The only way to get a Mr Darcy is to make him up.""I much preferred this biopic to the movie ""Becoming Jane"" as in that movie, we are led to assume that Tom LeFroy was the great love of Jane's life and it all seems a bit melodramatic - here, the portrayal of Ms Austen's private life and thoughts on love is given a more realistic treatment. Tom LeFroy is viewed here as someone she was attracted to but once out of her life 'she didn't spend more than five minutes thinking about.""This has a ring of truth to it in my opinion as so little is really known about Jane Austen's love life - due in part to the fact that much of her personal letters were destroyed by her sister Cassandra after Jane's death. What is portrayed in this biopic [by screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes] is based on the surviving personal correspondence and family recollections.The greatest mystery about Jane Austen is the question of how a writer who remained single all her life, with no known love affair, could write with such depth of insight about human relationships, in particular love affairs? I felt this biopic with Ms Austen ruminating in asides, managed to answer some of those puzzlements to a degree of credibility. It does not rely on some fantastical theory of a great love, but is based on careful research and a very stark level of frankness.In the biopic, Jane advises her niece Fanny never to marry without affection - lending credence to the theme in her novels, where her heroines marry for love.The casting for this biopic was well-done: Olivia Williams is credible in a difficult role. She portrays Jane with a level of honesty, acerbic wit,and moments of humorous insights that prove revelatory in understanding Ms Austen. I felt this did justice to painting a realistic picture of the author as opposed to the idea of a quiet, unassuming spinster author. Imogen Poots is lovely as Jane's niece Fanny, reflecting a young girl on the cusp of adulthood with a certain naivete in matters of love, still relying on her famous aunt for advice in matters of love, though ultimately following her own heart. Greta Sacchi as Jane's sister Cassandra did not really make an impression on me. Among the male actors, I felt Hugh Bonneville [as Rev Bridges] portrayed the part of one of Jane's ex-suitors [who still seems to hold a torch for her] with a great level of depth and poignancy.In all, I felt this biopic did justice to portraying the latter life of Jane Austen - an author who is pictured here as having given up a comfortable life that she would have had if she had married the wealthy Harris Bigg-Wither [the only known proposal] 15 yrs prior to her death, and instead chose freedom, to write and find her own bearings, to be her 'own husband' so to speak. Frank and poignant, this biopic has a ring of truth to it.",5,A wonderful adaptation of Sense and Sensibility and a compelling insight into Austen's life,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,6874,"['SENSE',

1138174,AU61CID785ACB,B0012OVCE6,Zuberdeen,"[6, 8]","At last, an adaptation that does justice to Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility! Unlike many, I was a little disappointed by the Emma Thompson version (despite Alan Rickman's excellent turn as Brandon, I could NOT get past Emma Thompson's age) and when I heard that Andrew Davies was writing this screenplay, I was thrilled. As a huge fan of Davies' Pride & Prejudice, I hoped for great things, and boy does he deliver! Most of the characters are beautifully cast, and Hattie Morahan as Elinor is particularly good. Jean Marsh is deliciously evil as Fanny Dashwood and Dan Stevens as Edward Ferrars is sweet and funny. I was most concerned about Col. Brandon, since he is, oddly enough, my favorite character in the book. David Morrissey plays Brandon beautifully though: stalwart, courageous, serious; he isn't Alan Rickman, but he's very good. The settings are gorgeous and the costumes accurate and well made. The best thing about an Andrew Davies screenplay is that he has respect for the original material -- if you are a reader and love Jane Austen's books, you will surely love this adaptation as well. This is a faithful, lovely rendering of one of Austen's best. Highly recommended!",5,Wonderful!
