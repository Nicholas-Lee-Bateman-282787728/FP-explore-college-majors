I was a boozer, a user, and a loser. My friends were dealers, cons, and 18 karat pimps. But now, I'm out of jail and picking up my life right where I left off. I'm back in school, living at home, and learning all sorts of things about my body. I'm finding out that though the faces have changed, the hassles are just the same."" (said at the start of each episode)Strangers With Candy was one of the best television shows ever made in the history of television. I'm deeply saddened by its cancellation - it was somewhat ahead of its time.This series stars Stephen Colbert as Chuck Noblet, the poorly-informed, opinionated history teacher, Paul Dinello as Geoffrey Jellineck, the fragile, feminine art teacher, and Amy Sedaris as the ""boozer, user, and loser,"" Jerri Blank. Other characters include Principal Onyx Blackman (Greg Hollimon), Sara Blank (Deborah Rush), Derrick Blank (Larc Spies), Guy Blank (Roberto Gari), as well as many others.(as stated at the start of this review) Jerri is a 46 year old woman that goes back to high school after 32 years of being a teenage runaway. She spent those 32 years doing drugs, drinking booze, and prostituting herself. But now she's back in school trying for a fresh start in life.She lives at home with her stepmom, Sara (who hates her), her stepbrother, Derrick (who hates her), her stepmom's lover, Stew (who kinda hates her), and her dad, Guy (who loves her).Chuck Noblet and Geoffrey Jellineck are two straight teachers of Jerri's that become...""friendly...after a chance meeting in a truck-stop bathroom."" They get VERY...friendly...but hide their relationship from others at school since homosexuality is looked down upon. However, most of the students realize what's going on between Chuck and Geoffrey, while the teachers really have no clue.Jerri is supposed to learn a lesson about life in every episode, but she always ends up learning the wrong lesson. Even though she learns the wrong lesson, everything seems to work out...well, for her, anyway.This series is a mockery of after-school specials, especially Florence Fisher's documentary, ""The Trip Back"" from the 1970s. Jerri Blank's character was based entirely on Florence Fisher and the trials and tribulations of her life.Strangers With Candy is silly, stupid, and enormously inappropriate, but that's what makes it so fantastic. It's one of the best shows I've ever seen, and I highly recommend it.

979546,A1MOGEXNCBZE3U,B000EWBNM8,"M. Packham ""Stuart""","[3, 3]","Having never seen SWC before, I ordered this complete series box-set not knowing exactly what to expect. I'd heard great things about it. Suffice to say, I was bowled over by how funny the show is and how excellent the performances are in it. Amy Sedaris has crafted an hilarious character in Jerri Blank, a 46-year-old high school freshman. Jerri Blank seems to be everything at once: streetwise yet innocent; lusting after boys one day and girls the next; possibly a man; an F-student but a violin virtuoso. The list goes on. Further, her old age is not mentioned once in the show as being somewhat out of the ordinary, nor does her frequently bizarre behaviour attract untoward attention. SWC really seems to exist in a parallel universe where anything can (and often does) happen. For this reason it is truly a unique and gleefully bizarre show.There are some episodes which are truly laugh-out-loud hilarious. The funniest involve Jellineck (Paul Dinello), Noblett (Stephen Colbert) and Principal Blackman (Greg Hollimon). These three characters rarely have a line which isn't comedy gold. The episodes which feature only Jerri Blank are still funny, especially because Amy Sedaris is so brilliant in her role, but without the supporting characters the show can, at times, become a little boring. This is the case for the first four episodes of season two, which don't feature Jellineck or Noblett at all.As for DVD features, I would take issue with the comments about the flimsy packaging. Granted, it is not an architectural triumph; however, I haven't had any problems with it, all the DVDs stay in place and nothing has fallen apart. The extras on the DVDs aren't that plentiful but they are worth watching, especially the PSA short 'The Road Back' featuring a real-life 'boozer and loser' woman who tours schools and basically yells at students with horror stories of her years spent as an addict. Clearly this film served as the inspiration behind Jerri Blank, so for SWC die-hards it is worth watching for that reason alone. There's also some commentaries which are insightful and funny.Ultimately, I thought this was great value. You get plenty of laughs for $50 and I will certainly be re-watching it again, given there's so many lines which I am sure have slipped past me watching it the first time. If you like your comedy on the bizarre (and often rude) side, this is for you.",4,"Hilarious, weird and immensely rewatchable",1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,2393,"['Having', 'never', 'seen', 'SWC', 'ordered', 'complete', 'series', 'box-set', 'not', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', ""'d"", 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'Suffice', 'say', 'was', 'bowled', 'over', 'how', 'funny', 'show', 'how', 'excellent', 'performances', 'are', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'crafted', 'hilarious', 'character', 'Jerri', 'Blank', '46-year-old', 'high', 'school', 'freshman', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'be', 'everything', 'once', 'streetwise', 'yet', 'innocent', 'lusting', 'boys', 'one', 'day', 'girls', 'next', 'possibly', 'man', 'F-student', 'violin', 'virtuoso', 'list', 'Further', 'old', 'age', 'not', 'mentioned', 'once', 'show', 'being', 'somewhat', 'ordinary', 'frequently', 'bizarre', 'behaviour', 'attract', 'untoward', 'attention', 'SWC', 'really', 'exist', 'parallel', 'universe', 'where', 'anything', 'can', 'often', 'happen', 'reason', 'truly', 'unique', 'gleefully', 'bizarre', 'show.There', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', 'truly', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'funniest', 'involve', 'Jellineck', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'Noblett', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Principal', 'Blackman', 'Greg', 'Hollimon', 'three', 'characters', 'rarely', 'have', 'line', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'gold', 'episodes', 'feature', 'only', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'are', 'still', 'funny', 'especially', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'so', 'brilliant', 'role', 'supporting', 'characters', 'show', 'can', 'times', 'become', 'little', 'boring', 'case', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'Jellineck', 'Noblett', 'all.As', 'DVD', 'features', 'would', 'take', 'issue', 'comments', 'flimsy', 'packaging', 'Granted', 'not', 'architectural', 'triumph', 'however', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'problems', 'DVDs', 'stay', 'place', 'nothing', 'fallen', 'apart', 'extras', 'DVDs', 'are', ""n't"", 'plentiful', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'PSA', 'short', 'Road', 'Back', 'featuring', 'real-life', ""'boozer"", 'loser', 'woman', 'who', 'schools', 'basically', 'yells', 'students', 'horror', 'stories', 'years', 'spent', 'addict', 'Clearly', 'film', 'served', 'inspiration', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'so', 'SWC', 'die-hards', 'worth', 'watching', 'reason', 'alone', 'also', 'commentaries', 'are', 'insightful', 'funny.Ultimately', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'value', 'get', 'plenty', 'laughs', '50', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 're-watching', 'again', 'given', 'so', 'many', 'lines', 'am', 'sure', 'have', 'slipped', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'like', 'comedy', 'bizarre', 'often', 'rude', 'side']",N/A

Rasband,"[70, 75]","Amy Sedaris is a very attractive woman but you would not know it until the final episode of the series ""Stangers With Candy"", which ran for three seasons on Comedy Central and is now collected on this DVD set.  Sedaris plays Jerri Blank, a 46-year-old former teen-age runaway/junkie/whore/thief/jailbird who has come back to high school for another chance.  Her face is covered with hideous-seeming makeup and her wardrobe is the truly appalling worst of 1970's chic (which is what she wore the first time around.)  The creators of this remarkable show takes this unlikely premise and run with it, turning the series into a withering parody of every moralistic, melodramatic ""afterschool special"" you ever saw.Fans of Comedy Central will want to see Stephen Colbert as Mr. Noblets, the nasty history teacher.  He incarnates all the worst traits of every teacher who ever hated you: he's lazy, mistaken in his facts, mean and cowardly and Colbert makes him hilarious.  He's so authentic that it's actually hard to watch him sometimes be spiteful to the stangely sympathetic Jerri.  The regular cast is rounded out by series co-writer Paul Dinello as the wussy, self-absorbed art reacher Mr. Jellineck, and Greg Holliman as the Idi Amin-like Principal Blackman (that's his name--a good example of the series' bracing political incorrectness.)My favorite episode is the series finale which features as a guest star the startlingly hot Winona Ryder as the high school queen mean girl.  She learns her lesson in just the wrong way, as the school comes to an apocalyptic end.  Check out the special features on these DVD's for some truly funny outtakes and compilations of the fabulous dance numbers which ended every episode.  It looks like they had a lot of fun making this show, and you will thoroughly enjoy it too.  It's like a smarter, extended, genuinely amusing John Waters project.",5,Weirdly Compelling and Uproariously Rude,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,1884,"['Amy', 'Sedaris', 'very', 'attractive', 'woman', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'Stangers', 'Candy', 'ran', 'three', 'seasons', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'now', 'collected', 'DVD', 'set', 'Sedaris', 'Jerri', 'Blank', '46-year-old', 'former', 'teen-age', 'runaway/junkie/whore/thief/jailbird', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'chance', 'face', 'covered', 'hideous-seeming', 'makeup', 'wardrobe', 'truly', 'appalling', 'worst', '1970', 'chic', 'what', 'wore', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'creators', 'remarkable', 'show', 'unlikely', 'premise', 'run', 'turning', 'series', 'withering', 'parody', 'moralistic', 'melodramatic', 'afterschool', 'special', 'ever', 'saw.Fans', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Mr.', 'Noblets', 'nasty', 'history', 'teacher', 'worst', 'traits', 'teacher', 'who', 'ever', 'hated', 'lazy', 'mistaken', 'facts', 'mean', 'cowardly', 'Colbert', 'hilarious', 'so', 'authentic', 'actually', 'hard', 'watch', 'sometimes', 'be', 'spiteful', 'stangely', 'sympathetic', 'Jerri', 'regular', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'series', 'co-writer', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'wussy', 'self-absorbed', 'art', 'Mr.', 'Jellineck', 'Greg', 'Holliman', 'Idi', 'Amin-like', 'Principal', 'Blackman', 'name', 'good', 'example', 'series', 'bracing', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'favorite', 'episode', 'series', 'finale', 'guest', 'star', 'startlingly', 'hot', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'high', 'school', 'queen', 'mean', 'girl', 'lesson', 'just', 'wrong', 'way', 'school', 'apocalyptic', 'end', 'Check', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'truly', 'funny', 'outtakes', 'compilations', 'fabulous', 'dance', 'numbers', 'ended', 'episode', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'making', 'show', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'too', 'smarter', 'extended', 'genuinely', 'amusing', 'John', 'Waters', 'project']",N/A

Trolling the Video store one afternoon, I decided that I wanted to rent a comedy DVD. So I thought I'd check this one out.Amy Sedaris (David Sedaris' sister), stars as Gerri Blank, a 46-year-old high school student. Seems that Gerri never got the chance to finish school when she was still a teen, due to her being a drug addict/prisoner. So, after being released from her lengthy prison-stint, Gerri decides to return to high school.Gerri is also living at home with her catatonic father, surly younger brother, and antagonistic step-mother. Ridiculed by her classmates and teachers at school, Gerri's family doesn't treat her much better. Daily, Gerri struggles to win approval, while those around her consider her to be a pathetic specimen of humanity. She tries so hard to succeed both socially and academically, that the viewer can't help but root for Gerri.The other characters in this show are a menagerie of off-beat, bizarre, people. Be forewarned, this is not a P.C. show. It regularly pokes fun at minorities, women, drug addiction, etc. It's all clearly done in a tongue-and-cheek way, though. This show is also laced with liberal amounts of vulgar language, and flagrant sexual innuendo. It's definitely not a G-rated sitcom.Gerri conveys a child-like vulnerability, with her sorrowful, hang-dog face. Though she has quite a checkered past, Gerri is a kindly person at heart, who only wants to be accepted for who she is. That makes her only human after all. She reminds me of Louise Lasser's character in Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Like Gerri, Mary Hartman was another child-woman, that's thoroughly bewildered by the world around her.Strangers With Candy certainly doesn't take itself too seriously. Like Married, With Children, it deliberately pushes the proverbial envelope, as an absurd sitcom. And it works brilliantly.",5,Brilliantly absurd sitcom.,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1904,"['never', 'saw', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'when', 'was', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Trolling', 'Video', 'store', 'one', 'afternoon', 'decided', 'wanted', 'rent', 'comedy', 'DVD', 'So', 'thought', ""'d"", 'check', 'one', 'out.Amy', 'Sedaris', 'David', 'Sedaris', 'sister', 'Gerri', 'Blank', '46-year-old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Gerri', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'finish', 'school', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'teen', 'due', 'being', 'drug', 'addict/prisoner', 'So', 'being', 'released', 'lengthy', 'prison-stint', 'Gerri', 'return', 'high', 'school.Gerri', 'also', 'living', 'home', 'catatonic', 'father', 'surly', 'younger', 'brother', 'antagonistic', 'step-mother', 'Ridiculed', 'classmates', 'teachers', 'school', 'Gerri', 'family', ""n't"", 'treat', 'much', 'better', 'Daily', 'Gerri', 'win', 'approval', 'consider', 'be', 'pathetic', 'specimen', 'humanity', 'so', 'hard', 'succeed', 'socially', 'academically', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'Gerri.The', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'menagerie', 'off-beat', 'bizarre', 'people', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'P.C', 'show', 'regularly', 'fun', 'minorities', 'women', 'drug', 'addiction', 'etc', 'clearly', 'done', 'tongue-and-cheek', 'way', 'though', 'show', 'also', 'laced', 'liberal', 'amounts', 'vulgar', 'language', 'flagrant', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'definitely', 'not', 'G-rated', 'sitcom.Gerri', 'conveys', 'child-like', 'vulnerability', 'sorrowful', 'hang-dog', 'face', 'quite', 'checkered', 'past', 'Gerri', 'kindly', 'person', 'heart', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'accepted', 'who', 'only', 'human', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'character', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'Gerri', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'was', 'child-woman', 'thoroughly', 'bewildered', 'world', 'her.Strangers', 'Candy', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Married', 'Children', 'deliberately', 'proverbial', 'envelope', 'absurd', 'sitcom', 'brilliantly']",N/A
