My daughter does not get to watch much television or movies because most are so inappropriate.  However, the Polies are fun, upbeat, positive, overcome challenges with problem solving, they work together with family and friends, and there is no violence or shouting.  I don't mind that my little one is 'addicted' to the Polie family movies!Also, we bought the VHS version this time, but wish we'd gone with the DVD.  The DVD does a much better job of displaying the amazing graphics in the film.",5,We love the Polie family!,1059350400,"07 28, 2003",2003,595,"['not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Polie', 'movie', 'Baby', 'Bot', 'Chase', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'daughter', 'not', 'get', 'watch', 'much', 'television', 'movies', 'most', 'are', 'so', 'inappropriate', 'However', 'Polies', 'are', 'fun', 'upbeat', 'positive', 'overcome', 'challenges', 'problem', 'solving', 'work', 'together', 'family', 'friends', 'violence', 'shouting', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'one', ""'addicted"", 'Polie', 'family', 'movies', 'Also', 'bought', 'VHS', 'version', 'time', 'wish', ""'d"", 'gone', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'displaying', 'amazing', 'graphics', 'film']",N/A

This is a more up beat, happy movie with some very cute songs and a very cute story line.  It's a very retro new age way in cartoons with its' bright colors and wonderful characters!  This is a very entertaining show.  The only thing bad I have to say is that these cartoons are usually around ten to fifteen minutes in length and this is a lot longer for a child to sit through and may get bored.
