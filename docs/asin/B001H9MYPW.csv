1199608,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001H9MYPW,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","I'll still give Season Two five stars due to its unstinting excellence, but in truth this season falls slightly short of the powerful wallop delivered in Season One. Season Two is darker all around - Gabriel Byrne's Paul Weston has moved to New York City and his new environs are dark.  He's got a bleak, poorly lit apartment - the darkness seems unrelenting, a feeling made stronger by Paul's bleak mood (putting together a new single life after an ugly end-of-season breakup with wife Kate) and a roster of appallingly depressing cases: Mia (Hope Davis) and her abject, frightening loneliness; April (Allison Pill) and her untreated cancer diagnosis; Oliver (Aaron Shaw) and his warring parents; and Walter (John Mahoney), a high-powered executive whose stress and fall lead to a suicide attempt.  Not what one would describe as a barrel-full of laughs.Season Two lacks the breakout star turn of Mia Wasikowska, whose 'Sophie' character dominated Season One.  Still, for my wife and I, young Aaron Shaw was the emotional center of the series. This middle arc (it's the third episode of each five-week rotation) was the strongest story.  It was heartbreaking to watch how the antipathy between two young parents had completely undermined this kid's confidence and place in life.  Byrne does a wonderful job in that one in nurturing a relationship with Oliver and expressing exasperation - if not outright disgust - in the actions of his parents.  As in Season One, it's the strength of Byrne's quiet - a sign of his active, aggressive listening - that is the hallmark of the show.Like Season One, Season Two re-casts the storylines from the original Israeli productionIn Treatment -Betipul Season 2- Israeli Tv Series 9 DVD English Subtitles.  With Season Three, the show's producers have outlasted its inspiration and are forced to come up with original narratives.  Season Two's themes are universal: professional success vs. happiness; cancer (and its effect on shaky family dynamics); divorce and its consequences on innocent victims; and the toll of corporate warfare on its human combatants.  All of these translated readily from Tel Aviv to New York City.",5,"Season Two is darker all around, but still makes for compelling watching",1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,2163,"[""'ll"", 'still', 'give', 'Season', 'Two', 'five', 'stars', 'due', 'unstinting', 'excellence', 'truth', 'season', 'slightly', 'short', 'powerful', 'wallop', 'delivered', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Two', 'darker', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Paul', 'Weston', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'new', 'environs', 'are', 'dark', 'got', 'bleak', 'poorly', 'lit', 'apartment', 'darkness', 'unrelenting', 'feeling', 'made', 'stronger', 'Paul', 'bleak', 'mood', 'putting', 'together', 'new', 'single', 'life', 'ugly', 'end-of-season', 'breakup', 'wife', 'Kate', 'roster', 'appallingly', 'depressing', 'cases', 'Mia', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'abject', 'frightening', 'loneliness', 'April', 'Allison', 'Pill', 'untreated', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'Oliver', 'Aaron', 'Shaw', 'warring', 'parents', 'Walter', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'high-powered', 'executive', 'stress', 'fall', 'lead', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Not', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'describe', 'barrel-full', 'laughs.Season', 'Two', 'breakout', 'star', 'turn', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'character', 'dominated', 'Season', 'One', 'Still', 'wife', 'young', 'Aaron', 'Shaw', 'was', 'emotional', 'center', 'series', 'middle', 'arc', 'third', 'episode', 'five-week', 'rotation', 'was', 'strongest', 'story', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'how', 'antipathy', 'two', 'young', 'parents', 'had', 'completely', 'undermined', 'kid', 'confidence', 'place', 'life', 'Byrne', 'wonderful', 'job', 'one', 'nurturing', 'relationship', 'Oliver', 'expressing', 'exasperation', 'not', 'outright', 'disgust', 'actions', 'parents', 'Season', 'One', 'strength', 'Byrne', 'quiet', 'sign', 'active', 'aggressive', 'listening', 'hallmark', 'show.Like', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Two', 'storylines', 'original', 'Israeli', 'productionIn', 'Treatment', '-Betipul', 'Season', '2-', 'Israeli', 'Tv', 'Series', '9', 'DVD', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'Season', 'Three', 'show', 'producers', 'have', 'outlasted', 'inspiration', 'are', 'forced', 'come', 'up', 'original', 'narratives', 'Season', 'Two', 'themes', 'are', 'universal', 'professional', 'success', 'vs.', 'happiness', 'cancer', 'effect', 'shaky', 'family', 'dynamics', 'divorce', 'consequences', 'innocent', 'victims', 'toll', 'corporate', 'warfare', 'human', 'combatants', 'translated', 'readily', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'New', 'York', 'City']",In Treatment: Season 2

Gabriel Byrne, as Paul, continues as the impassioned psychologist, dealing with a new set of patients.  He sees a female college student with lymphoma, a boy whose parents are divorcing, a female attorney who he was his patient twenty years prior, and an aging company CEO .  Meanwhile, he continues to have both clinical supervision and personal counseling with Gina, Diane Wiest.Paul struggles with many of the same issues that were difficult for him in season one - - boundaries with patients, his marriage, his relationships with his children and anger and dissatisfaction with his personal and professional life.  On top of that, he is being sued by the father of a patient from Season 1.TV series do not get any better than this.

Thus, I had to get into medication and outpatient therapy for many years in my 20s.  Decades later I still must take the medication but I haven't needed therapy in a long time.  However, those early intense years of therapy were extremely helpful for the rest of my life.  This series absolutely faithfully duplicates the entire experience. Gabriel Byrne could be a real psychiatrist.  I've never seen a movie or tv shrink this faithful to the real deal. Even better, when he himself is in therapy, it is absolutely real to life that he himself is a mess when he is the patient in therapy.  The patients are diverse in age, sex, race and problems.  In short, there is something for everyone with this patient base.  I especially enjoyed the college girl with cancer who would not get treatment, Josh Mahoney (the father in FRASIER) as a CEO under fire, and the young boy with the constantly battling, divorcing parents. This season, Paul is also under siege with a malpractice suit, which was filed against him by the family of a patient who killed himself. The ends of treatment for each patient are realistic as well.  Rather than seeing the patient off to a ""happily ever after life"", which would be impossible, Paul instead sees them off to an uncertain future but one in which they probably have a better idea of who they are as individuals and what they have as strengths and weaknesses.

It has seven discs, and by the end of disc 2, I thought to myself, this is very good again, but its not really as good as season 1. But then it started to build up. I just finished the last two discs, and I am blown away all over again! I blame the acting, the directing, and of course, the writing. Absolutely first-rate!If a show about 5 different people going to see a therapist sounds intriguing, give In Treatment a serious attempt. Each character or patient takes a while to get to the meat of their story. None of them really know what to expect in therapy, and they aren't able to trust the therapist. So as he slowly wins them over, and as they share their incredible stories- This show REALLY starts to materialize.Did I mention it is intense? If I weren't such a big macho-type-of-guy, I might have almost choked back a tear or two here! Alright- They actually got me once. Don't tell anyone! What can I say? By the end of the season, I found myself deeply identifying with every single character. Even the ones I didn't like for a while! But, the one that really got me was the 23 year-old girl who was coping with her diagnosis of cancer. Her acting and the plight of her character just really had me wanting to help her. This show is Masterpiece Theater, evolved.Unfortunately, I doubt In Treatment will ever be as popular as it deserves to be. I can't really recommend this to my friends. I don't think they would ""get"" it. I can picture them just looking at me like I was a nerd, but I've studied psychology in college and I've used therapy to get through some of my own tough times. I've been fascinated by the profession for a long time. I've seen how well it can help untie the knots in your thoughts, like a massage can handle the knots in your muscles.

Gabriel Byrne's ""Paul"" is such a complex character.  Likable when he is with his patients and someone I wanted to throttle when he was with his therapist.  It was a brilliant portrayal of the ""human-ness"" in all of us that is able to put our own problems in a box and do the right thing by others when we have to.  Each patient brought something extraordinary to the table this season.  The ""Oliver"" segment absolutely broke my heart.  Of all of the segments though, the ones between Paul and Gina were the most compelling.  Dianne Wiest was an absolute marvel.  The facial expressions were absolutely spot on and in Week 6 she really showed why she earned the Emmy that year.  O.M.G!  I sat there watching that whole episode unfold with my jaw dropped.

Each one was multi-layered, surprising and interesting. It helped that all the actors were superb.Season Two still offers good acting, but some of the patients' stories aren't terribly original, and one was very annoying. The strongest, most interesting and eventually surprising patient is Walter, played to perfection by John Mahoney. But Mia - who has a history with Weston - to me was a somewhat weak and uninteresting character whose story lacked depth. Oliver, a boy whose parents are getting a divorce, was a very authentic character - but his issues and the issues of divorce were pretty standard and expected. Not unusual. They could have appeared in many other TV shows.April, a character who has cancer but stubbornly refuses treatment, to me was a VERY annoying character who I just couldn't seem to identify with. Perhaps the actress played her too whiny. I found myself getting frustrated with her constant self-denials and refusal for treatment, and the story seemed to get bogged down. It just didn't feel right to me.Paul's sessions with Gina remained great, and Paul's legal troubles this season also were very interesting.

Rarely do the characters leave the confines of Paul's (Gabriel Byrne) therapy room.  The show is all about characters, creating dimension to each person, be it a seemingly selfish father, a stoic corporate worker, or an unlikeable attorney.  The show strives for artistic integrity, and barely has any viewers when it airs (hence it could only be on HBO).With regards to Season 2, the show felt more real and organic, relying less on surprising twists and connections between the multiple patients, and was more about treating the patients, as well as dealing with Paul's own demons.  If you enjoyed the first season, I can easily recommend season 2.  It makes both references to the first, and provides a better crafted season.  The show is mesmerizing, and very well acted.

They include Mia (Hope Davis), an top attorney who Paul had treated twenty years earlier, April (Alison Pill), a college student denying the fact that she has cancer, Oliver (Aaron Shaw), caught in the middle of his parents' divorce, and Walter (John Mahoney), a successful CEO who is suffering from insomnia.  In addition, Paul continues his own therapy with Dr. Gina Toll (Dianne Weist).This half-hour, 5 times each week series from HBO may not be for everybody, but it is certainly one of the best written, acted and directed series on television (cable or otherwise) today.With a minimum of exceptions, the entire show is set in the offices of either Paul or Gina, as they hold their therapy sessions, thus each episode unfolds like a one-act play as the characters reveal more of their inner selves and turmoil.There are no action sequences, no CGI, just two (sometimes three or four) people talking about themselves, their relationships and their problems, some of which are probably not too far removed from our own.  That makes for riveting drama.I can't recommend this show too highly. Michael B.
