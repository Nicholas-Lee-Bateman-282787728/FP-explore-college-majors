458989,A1BXPI18MLL5OV,630530209X,"Alexandra Fox ""opera connoisseur""","[0, 0]","Hurray for another Sondheim masterpiece--for which he garnered the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama!!! I am always amazed at how Sondheim's brilliance has continuity through all of his works, yet his compositions and style always change (like a chameleon). This work's music reflects the pointillist style of the subject, the painter Seurat, with sometimes choppy (in an artistic, good way) tunes...I love the title song &#34;Sunday in the Park with George&#34;. And of course, the songs &#34;Putting It Together&#34; and &#34;Move On&#34; must be mentioned, for they are the pieces that are more identifiable outside of this musical. Sondheim and Lapine weave a story of art, and love, and how to move on with one's life. Dot and George's love for each other is complex and lingering, and the audience view their legacy unfolding, whether they stay together or not.On to the interpreters...Bernadette Peters. Brava! Her unique tone served her well in this part of Dot, and her artistry was fully on display as her range of emotions was tested and flourished with this material. As for Mandy Patinkin, he was custom-made, perfectly suited for the part of George, the stoic painter who lives for art. Both lead actors snagged Tony nominations but sadly did not win.Anyway, JUST BUY IT! This Broadway dvd is filmed with precision and great quality with appropriate full-stage shots and close-ups. There is nothing to complain about, unless, of course, this is just not your &#34;thing&#34;; in that case, you will at least experience the brilliance of Sondheim that leaves you with a musical unlike the work of any other composer. If you buy it, it is money well-spent.",5,"Sondheim, Peters, Patinkin...what's NOT to like???",1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,1664,"['Hurray', 'Sondheim', 'masterpiece', 'garnered', '1985', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Drama', 'am', 'always', 'amazed', 'how', 'Sondheim', 'brilliance', 'continuity', 'works', 'yet', 'compositions', 'style', 'always', 'change', 'chameleon', 'work', 'music', 'pointillist', 'style', 'subject', 'painter', 'Seurat', 'sometimes', 'choppy', 'artistic', 'good', 'way', 'tunes', 'love', 'title', 'song', '34', 'Sunday', 'Park', 'George', '34', 'course', 'songs', '34', 'Putting', 'Together', '34', '34', 'Move', '34', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'are', 'pieces', 'are', 'more', 'identifiable', 'outside', 'musical', 'Sondheim', 'Lapine', 'weave', 'story', 'art', 'love', 'how', 'move', 'one', 'life', 'Dot', 'George', 'love', 'other', 'complex', 'lingering', 'audience', 'view', 'legacy', 'unfolding', 'stay', 'together', 'not.On', 'interpreters', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Brava', 'unique', 'tone', 'served', 'well', 'part', 'Dot', 'artistry', 'was', 'fully', 'display', 'range', 'emotions', 'was', 'tested', 'flourished', 'material', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'was', 'custom-made', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'part', 'George', 'stoic', 'painter', 'who', 'art', 'lead', 'actors', 'snagged', 'Tony', 'nominations', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'win.Anyway', 'JUST', 'BUY', 'IT', 'Broadway', 'dvd', 'filmed', 'precision', 'great', 'quality', 'appropriate', 'full-stage', 'shots', 'close-ups', 'nothing', 'complain', 'course', 'just', 'not', '34', 'thing', '34', 'case', 'will', 'least', 'experience', 'brilliance', 'Sondheim', 'musical', 'work', 'other', 'composer', 'buy', 'money', 'well-spent']",N/A

The set, the seamstresses who assembled the fabulous costumes, this was a day in the park for any and all artists, that is to say, who draw, paint, build sew, assemble . illuminate, record ""artists"". And nothing wrong with the singers. Bernadette shines in this one. Mandy is no slacker either. I personally prefer a baritone with a top A...but that'sjust a personal preference.But as one reviewer noted...no subtitles. Just because something is in the King's English...that does NOT mean that the words are very well spoken/sung by the players. This is indeed a major flaw...for some 30% of the story is muddled. But it doesn't matter much for the story is fatally flawed to begin with.My problem is that after listening for decades to music of a wide variety, including bel canto, folk, country, gospel...I said wide variety...I find I am becoming a more than weary of what could be called the ""Broadway muscial motif"".They have a way of sounding so very similar. It is hard to describe. I'll try this: that the melodies and tempi seem only barely able to emerge from recitative.Here is a sample of a tune from this show:  C-D; C-D; C-A...and then we ""vary"" that monotony by ending on a 'wistful note'...C-D; CD; C-Ab...The melody bounces around sort of aimlessly...like the story line. I would not call it a libretto. A libretto has at least some shining star of a hero or heroine, and often both. Here ""George"" is made out to be obsessive compulsive( dot, dot, dot with his brush, get it? ); totally self absorbed, not even human...his lover and model has a child by him, and he doesn't even turn to look at it, but dismisses the both of them coldly. Does that sound heroic to you? It can only leave one ..uh...hating artists in general? Hating men in general? What are the writer and composer thinking?...are they both chronically cynical. Or wanting to be seen as ""modern', or rather 'post modern' where there is no decency in humankind? Where we eschew anyting remotely like ""prettiness""?It is said that a successful opera, or musical, should not only cause you to hum the melodies later...but to relish hearing them again and again...for decades, or in the case of bel canto...for 160 years and more ! And here we are required to pay our money-and receive instead of music, something close to penuriousness....cheap, stingy- regarding anything like an inventive, glorious, soaring emotive melodic line... or as Pagliaccio says in his beloved aria: ""Le gente paga, y ridi vuole qua"" -""The people pay, and laughter is what they want"".I guess I am being unfairly critical. But when one's name is practically a household name...we expect extraordinary, don't we?Any composer devoted to his life's work...if you want to be remembered, it would help a great deal if said composer wrote music that the gentry would adore for generations...these notes in this paltry piece so  randomly strung together , and sounding SO broadway musical...barely...is the best way I know of to be forgotten before you die.It will not be helpful to angrily denounce the gentry for failing to undersand your ""genius"".  Just about any Italian opera will have you emerging from the performance dripping wet from your total immersion in music. It would seem that music, like paintings of the 20th century  has become ""shorthand""..scribblings, sketches on a napkin. To be thrown away. The real mystery is that there are( suckers ) gentry who are duped into paying a million dollars for one of those scribblings.

458993,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,630530209X,Birdman,"[1, 1]","For those who know this musical, whether in its original cast version or its UK revival, the visceral beauty of the work will come as no surprise. It is the show that converted me to Stephen Sondheim, made me hungry to learn more about the mysterious, short-lived Georges Seurat and convinced me that Bernadette Peters can excel at any role she takes. Ironically, and even for the period during which it was produced, the video's color resolution could have been far better, since Seurat's pigments for La Grande Jatte paled over time, too. Still, this is a work of sublime beauty and fine performances. Composed in almost symphonic form with perfect casting and jaw-dropping stagecraft, it was worthy of the Pulitzer Prize it received. James Lapine's book is filled with moments of great warmth, rage and humor. It taps the universals in one story with grace and polish.I will risk the consternation of those who believe the second act is a true cousin to the first. I do not. I would have preferred a slightly longer first act performed without break for two reasons. First, Act I tells  most of us a story about which we never knew. While the fictions Lapine injected into Act I were necessary -- we know so little about Seurat's reclusive life after all -- Act II speaks to us in large part about the callousness of the contemporary art market we already know. For a little while, the book falters, then recovers its footing about halfway through.In an era of cerebral musicals and pale revivals, some of which hold up onstage but not on recordings, Sunday in the Park with George is one hell of a musical. It has everything we seek when we go to musical theater; and the video producers really gave it a go, creating the permanent document of a timeless work and an era that has passed. The cast is uniformly fine.As one who completed an advanced degree in art history, I also have a special love for the painting and artist about whom the musical is based. In the subtext of Sondheim's work, then, is the admonition that we not forget these heroic figures, and that we pass their stories on to our children. I agree.

Here you get the original cast including Many Patinkin and Bernadette Peters captured for a PBS GREAT PERFORMANCES.  The camerawork is tight on them, and you see every nuance in their faces, and even get glimpses of what Mandy is drawing as he plays Seraut in the first act.  Some people find this one hard to relate to, and of the three available on DVD that is probably true.  PASSION and INTO THE WOODS deal with easier subject matter, and have more elaborate staging to work with.  But this is still a handsome production filled with vituoso performances of classic songs such as ""Tipping the Hat"" and ""Sunday"".  That it is a difficult musical shouldn't stop you by any means.  Like a fine wine it grows on you and warms you the more you imbibe.  The best part of the DVD is the commentary featuring both lead actors, Sondheim, and Lapine.  Mandy Pantinkin seems to dominate the discussion, but all chime in to reveal what a personal labor of love it was for all involved.  Sondheim's biggest revelation is that he originally intended George to be played by a BASS, and was skeptical of Mandy in the role!  Bernadette Peters good-heartedly remembers all the cast member names, and recalls many backstage stories centered on the performance.  Mandy seems most concerned with telling you about auditioning, and developing his ""dog"" voices.  Lapine talks of how dialogue became songs and vice versa.  It's a great track, and gives you insight into the show that will make you appreciate it that much more.And as a side note ... why all the problems with Act 2?

Specifically, I fell in love with the painting that it was based on--Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jette, by the pointellist painter, Georges Seurat (December 2, 1859 - March 29, 1891).  The pointellist movement was a bold and wonderful move on the part of this talented artist.  The style in which these pieces were painted was through a series of hundred of painted ""dots"" forming elaborate and colorful studies.  This beautiful musical brilliantly translates the themes and attitudes of Seurat's paintings.  The first half of the musical is devoted to Seurat (Mandy Patinkin) and his lover, Dot (Bernadette Peters), the inspiration for one of the characters in the famous painted park scene.  The second half follows Seurat's descendant, as he retraces the steps in the painter's life.  This is a wonderful, vivid and entertaining musical journey.  At age four, it was the one thing that motivated me to get on an airplane and travel to Chicago with my family, to at last see the marvelous painting that inspired the show--in the Chicago Museum of Art.

It is eternally frustrating that I cannot get to the centres to see his productions and have to content myself with recordings, or local productions, which are few and far between.These tapes of videoed stage productions are a godsend.I have long known the music from ""Sunday in the Park"" and indeed have used certain parts for lectures to my students as they explain well and simply the act of creation. It then is extremely moving to see how this work was presented on stage, and in many ways the DVD has the advantage over seeing it in the theatre as one is able to get close-ups and change of view point.I am not a particular fan of Ms. Peters but her performance as Dot is exceptional, both spirited and touching.

SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, the DVD, a staged production of the Stephen Sondheim, James Lapine Broadway musical is an unconventional show, sometimes more in the tradition of a Gilbert & Sullivan opera, in that the music is truly, as joked in the musical's book, 'variations on a theme'; one long sweep of music that climaxes in a powerful finale, bound to shake up the heart, and enlighten the mind.The synopsis of the play is bound to chase some away, as it did me for many years. It is a fictional account of real life 19th Century Parisian artist, Georges Seurat, and his attempts to finish his masterwork, ""Sunday Afternoon On The Isle of La Grande Jatte"", as the Paris art community ridicules the work in progress, and stands defiantly against the finished piece. During Act 2, you are rudely whisked away 100 years into the future, where a monstrous piece of art; a metallic iron lung, shell-like object, is beaming laser beams and playing new age-like music to a less than enthusiastic crowd of artists and would-be admirers. It is the work of the great grandson of Georges Seurat, who faces the same doubt and betrayal from his peers.The sad history of the artwork, brought to the front in a matter-of-fact way during a presentation during Act 2, in which aged daughter, (Bernadette Peters), and great grandson, (Mandy Pantinkin), recount the likes of Renoir and other famous painters of the era, retracting their entries into an art exhibit when it is learned, ""Sunday Afternoon On The Isle..."", would be included, brings characteristic emotional depth to the painting which is now regarded as a treasured piece of art, and indeed the painting is the star of the show, even taking a majestic bow during the closing curtain call.It sounds dry, but this is all very light-hearted, with traditional musical comedy amusements, which surmount to a power sucker punch of sadness, humanity and beauty, as the cast gathers for the final song. Get out your handkerchiefs. The cast is exemplary; Mandy Pantinkin delivers an alarmingly spiritualized tenor proclaiming the beauty of art, sure to send shivers your way, and Bernadette Peters, is aglow with an empathetic characterization, full of conviction and grace, rarely realized in a musical.Just a quibble. An annoying, but tolerable 'feed-front', (the dialogue is heard just slightly before it is spoken, it seems to happen often in these taped DVDs), can be heard distractingly at the quiter moments. Mandy Pantinkin, Bernadette Peters, Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine provide audio commentary.",5,EXTRAORDINARY SUNDAY,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,2728,"['now', 'then', 'come', 'work', 'say', 'movie', 'book', 'piece', 'music', 'so', 'entirely', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'life', 'quite', 'same', 'ever', 'again', 'SUNDAY', 'IN', 'THE', 'PARK', 'WITH', 'GEORGE', 'DVD', 'staged', 'production', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'James', 'Lapine', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'unconventional', 'show', 'sometimes', 'more', 'tradition', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'opera', 'music', 'truly', 'joked', 'musical', 'book', ""'variations"", 'theme', 'one', 'long', 'sweep', 'music', 'powerful', 'finale', 'bound', 'shake', 'up', 'heart', 'enlighten', 'mind.The', 'synopsis', 'play', 'bound', 'chase', 'away', 'did', 'many', 'years', 'fictional', 'account', 'real', 'life', '19th', 'Century', 'Parisian', 'artist', 'Georges', 'Seurat', 'attempts', 'finish', 'masterwork', 'Sunday', 'Afternoon', 'Isle', 'La', 'Grande', 'Jatte', 'Paris', 'art', 'community', 'work', 'progress', 'defiantly', 'finished', 'piece', 'Act', '2', 'are', 'rudely', 'whisked', 'away', '100', 'years', 'future', 'where', 'monstrous', 'piece', 'art', 'metallic', 'iron', 'lung', 'shell-like', 'object', 'beaming', 'laser', 'beams', 'playing', 'new', 'age-like', 'music', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'crowd', 'artists', 'would-be', 'admirers', 'work', 'great', 'grandson', 'Georges', 'Seurat', 'who', 'same', 'doubt', 'betrayal', 'peers.The', 'sad', 'history', 'artwork', 'brought', 'front', 'matter-of-fact', 'way', 'presentation', 'Act', '2', 'aged', 'daughter', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'great', 'grandson', 'Mandy', 'Pantinkin', 'recount', 'likes', 'Renoir', 'other', 'famous', 'painters', 'era', 'retracting', 'entries', 'art', 'exhibit', 'when', 'learned', 'Sunday', 'Afternoon', 'Isle', 'would', 'be', 'included', 'characteristic', 'emotional', 'depth', 'painting', 'now', 'regarded', 'treasured', 'piece', 'art', 'indeed', 'painting', 'star', 'show', 'even', 'taking', 'majestic', 'bow', 'closing', 'curtain', 'call.It', 'dry', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'traditional', 'musical', 'comedy', 'amusements', 'surmount', 'power', 'sucker', 'punch', 'sadness', 'humanity', 'beauty', 'cast', 'gathers', 'final', 'song', 'Get', 'handkerchiefs', 'cast', 'exemplary', 'Mandy', 'Pantinkin', 'alarmingly', 'spiritualized', 'tenor', 'proclaiming', 'beauty', 'art', 'sure', 'send', 'shivers', 'way', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'aglow', 'empathetic', 'characterization', 'full', 'conviction', 'grace', 'rarely', 'realized', 'musical.Just', 'quibble', 'annoying', 'tolerable', ""'feed-front"", 'dialogue', 'heard', 'just', 'slightly', 'spoken', 'happen', 'often', 'taped', 'DVDs', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'distractingly', 'quiter', 'moments', 'Mandy', 'Pantinkin', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'writer', 'James', 'Lapine', 'provide', 'audio', 'commentary']",N/A

And while  George had choices to make about the painting, Dot had choices to make  about George and their life (act 1) and George (II) had choices to make  about his fledging art life (act 2).The concept also gave an insight to  art appreciation.

The TV version (taped the week after the show closed in the Booth theatre where it played for 604 performances) is a beautiful transfer from stage to(small)screen.The sensitive performances, the delicate orchestrations, Tony Staiges Tony Award winning scenery, James Lapine's Pulitzer prize winning writing and Stephen Sondheim's deceptively beautiful score all combine to make this something very special.Perhaps a little too special: SUNDAY lost the 1984 Tony award to LA CAGE AUX FOLLES - an enjoyable yet conventional musical comedy (HELLO DOLLY! in drag) - and most of the initial reviews were unfavourable.  But the show had its supporters and continued to attract audiences and even some of the critics who disliked the show at first later reversed or at least ""clarified"" their opinions.Truth be told, SUNDAY is a rich piece and it is just not possible to penetrate all its layers in a single vieweing.The DVD allows viewers a chance to study, to consider, and yes, even question both the show and the painting that inspired it. Is that really a baby carriage? Why a monkey? How is the flower in the hat made to have such a shimmering violet color?The show contains sequences that do not in any way resemble standard musical theatre: The long number ""The Day off"" or even more startling, ""It's Hot Up Here!"" are in no way ""standard"" showtunes in 4/4 time. If anything, it is actually more like a chamber opera, but then labels are irrelevant.SUNDAY tells a tale of artistic creation.  The artist makes many sacrifices in his quest to ""finish the hat.""

However, I am always very moved by SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE.  I especially find the  first act to be the best part of the show.  And Sondheim constantly warms  my heart with his lyrics and beautiful music.The production of the video  of the show is very good.  Lapine gets some good shots, even though it's  basically a taped version of a Broadway show.  The editing in spots is very  good.Bernadette Peters, a favorite performer of mine, is not in very  good voice for the taping.  I think I've read that she was having vocal  problems at the time.  Some dubbing is apparent in spots.  Mr. Patinkin is  very subdued and subtle in his performance.The DVD is a preferable way  to watch this show due to its extra audio track of Sondheim, Lapine, Peters  and Patinkin reminiscing about it.  There are some great stories told by  the group.  Mr. Sondheim sheds some light on the earlier drafts of songs  and scenes.Remember, this show won the Pulitzer Prize!  It is not an  &quot;Oklahoma&quot; kind of musical -- it's very artsy and concerns a  difficult man obsessed with his art.  But it is so sweet and clever.

I'll bet that in other productions of this show, they have to make cutouts of the person who is playing George. It was a bit boring, the show. The girl who plays Louise was sassy in her painting costume. She had beautiful shoulders. If only George Seurat lived today and Louise was in a bikini.

Have you read all these rave reviews and felt afraid to give your own review because all the other reviewers can't be wrong and you don't want to look like an intellectual lightweight?Well, don't be afraid.  The first thing to notice is how tiny the group of reviewers is, even compared to Sondheim's ""Into the Woods"" and ""Sweeney Todd.""  Most viewers have either been warned off this show or else didn't make it past the first fifteen minutes of this not very popular and commercially unsuccessful production.  Those who go against the grain and build this up as one of the greatest Broadway musicals want you to feel inferior to them.  If not for the always wonderful Bernadette Peters, who alone brings any life to the first act, I doubt that even half of the reviewers here could have made it through that first act.And as for the score, could anyone seriously put this music in the same class as Show Boat, Porgy and Bess, South Pacific and West Side Story?  Check out here or on iTunes the number of artists who have covered even the supposedly more popular songs: ""Move On"" and ""Putting it Together.""  It's very close to zero.  No one wants to record the songs because they know that no one wants to listen to them.Sondheim's problem is not that he can not write ""hummable"" songs.  His problem is that he is just another mediocre composer who can't write songs that people want to hear.  But a brilliant lyricist.  He should have stuck to that.So don't be afraid to tell people what you really think of this musical:  that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes and you don't have to pretend that it's a great show just to go along with this small crowd.",2,The Emperor Isn't Wearing Any Clothes,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,1862,"['Are', 'someone', 'who', 'happened', 'see', 'production', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'advance', 'found', 'be', 'deadly', 'dull', 'tedious', 'passionless', 'completely', 'forgetable', 'forgotten', 'score', 'Have', 'read', 'rave', 'reviews', 'felt', 'afraid', 'give', 'own', 'review', 'other', 'reviewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'look', 'intellectual', 'lightweight', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'how', 'tiny', 'group', 'reviewers', 'even', 'compared', 'Sondheim', 'Into', 'Woods', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Most', 'viewers', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'show', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'not', 'very', 'popular', 'commercially', 'unsuccessful', 'production', 'who', 'go', 'grain', 'build', 'up', 'one', 'greatest', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'want', 'feel', 'inferior', 'not', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'who', 'alone', 'life', 'first', 'act', 'doubt', 'even', 'reviewers', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'first', 'act.And', 'score', 'could', 'anyone', 'seriously', 'put', 'music', 'same', 'class', 'Show', 'Boat', 'Porgy', 'Bess', 'South', 'Pacific', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'Check', 'out', 'here', 'iTunes', 'number', 'artists', 'who', 'have', 'covered', 'even', 'supposedly', 'more', 'popular', 'songs', 'Move', 'Putting', 'Together', 'very', 'close', 'zero', 'one', 'record', 'songs', 'know', 'one', 'listen', 'them.Sondheim', 'problem', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'hummable', 'songs', 'problem', 'just', 'mediocre', 'composer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'songs', 'people', 'want', 'hear', 'brilliant', 'lyricist', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'that.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'tell', 'people', 'what', 'really', 'think', 'musical', 'emperor', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'clothes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pretend', 'great', 'show', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'small', 'crowd']",N/A

This DVD is worth owning, not renting, because it is worth seeing repeatedly. Sondheim's scoring and lyrics are one reason; Patinkin and Bernadette Peters at their best is another, as is a flawless supporting cast. Certainly the second act, in which the same actors play reincarnated roles, is unique. (In the voice-over commentary, when Bernadette Peters plays 95-year-old Marie singing, ""Children and Art"", and her co-stars say, ""you didn't play this with makeup"", it is sort of a shock to realize that Ms. Peters did carry off this role with a minimum of makeup and a very real acting ability.)(It's also a howl to hear ""Data"" -- Brent Spiner, here in his role as George's 20th Century electronics engineer -- tell George he was quitting, ""I'm going back to NASA, there's just too much pressure in this line of work!"")Parents should probably pitch this to their kids as a very adult kind of production: ""adult"" in the manner of a very grown-up sensibility. George -- both the original 19th Century George Seurat and his 20th Century great-grandson -- feels a very adult yearning to create, to fulfill himself through his art.

Although both Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin have both enjoyed fine careers in film and television in addition to their stage work, their best work has been on stage, and by the nature of the medium, it has been more or less lost to us. This performance captures them doing what they do best. It is ironic that with the semi-rebirth of the film musical in recent years, there has been no attempt to do so with Patinkin, the premiere musical stage performer of the past thirty years. Here he is a marvel, crafting songs with vocals stylings of an inconceivable range.Sondheim's score is a thing of glory. Unlike many previous composers, Sondheim was concerned with making each song an organic part of the work as a whole. They don't stand alone, but absolutely require their setting in the rest of the musical. It is as if Sondheim wanted to make it impossible for any of them to be excerpted. Yet, each one is utterly remarkable, stamped with the highest possible craft and talent. What sets Sondheim's art apart from his fellow composers is the brilliance of his arrangements. He clearly has invested as much effort in arranging the music as he has in crafting the lyrics and writing the initial music. The arrangements are so hypnotic that at times I actually had to listen twice to a couple of musical numbers because I realized that I had failed to listen to the lyrics. The effect of the brilliant songs, the extraordinary performances, and the astonishing arrangements is absolutely breathtaking.The cast is beyond reproach, with numerous stellar performances beyond those by Patinkin and Peters. Barbara Byrne, Dana Ivey, Charles Kimbrough, and many others perform their roles to perfection. Interestingly, shortly after the run of the musical was over, two of the cast members went on to major television stardom: Charles Kimbrough stood out as Jim Dial in MURPHY BROWN while Brent Spiner created one of the most beloved characters in television history as Data in STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.In general, I have a low opinion of the stage musical. Most of them are more glitter and surface than substance, with superficially appealing music. SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, however, is one of the grand exceptions.

So many times you hear about how ""cerebral"" and ""inaccesible"" Sondheim shows are. Is it so hard for people to think and feel at the same time?  The beauty of this piece is that it forces the audience to think about their relationship with art (either as an artist or a patron) and at the same time allows you to care for the characters deeply.  Alright, so you have to listen to it a few times before you really begin to ""get it."" This work allows you to witness an artist (considered a genius by many) who devotes himself competely to his work only to realize that he must do it at the expense of all of his other relationships.  From ""Beautiful,"" during which George tries but realizes it's too late to connect with his aging mother, to ""We Do Not Belong Together,"" when the love of his life tells him that she simply cannot be #2 anymore, I am not sure how anyone can watch these amazing moments and NOT be moved.The score is haunting and the acting (except for a few moments that don't quite work from Mr. Patinkin) is astonishing.  It is a very risky choice having an opening number during which the soloist hardly moves, but Bernadette Peters draws you in from the start...brilliant acting.

459022,A243HY69GIAHFI,630530209X,tropic_of_criticism,"[2, 9]","The story of _Sunday in the Park with George_ is unusually inaccessible for a Sondheim work.  Unlike most of his mass-appeal pieces, such as _Phantom of the Opera_, this is a playwright's play.  To be sure it's  comprehensible by everyone, but I suspect those who would get the most out  of it would be fellow artists.  Far from being a plot driven work, this is  the exploration of an idea, a work ethic, a raison d'etre.Inasmuch  as there is a  plot, it is the story of how art is produced.  It is a  struggle delivered against the backdrop of a single family's history.  As  we are shown each generation in the family, we discover how the struggle to  produce great work often estranges loved ones, and  how the need to be paid  often alienates the artist from his own work.It is a fascinating ride,  but it is all about character, details, subtle observation, and the angst  of artistic creation.  Some people don't like such work, so if you're one  of these, you might want to rent before buying.However, if you're even  slightly artistically inclined, you will come away from this story  enriched. You will also find much to laugh about here.  The work is full of  interesting characters, and surprising character actors.  Brent Spiner and  Charles Kimbrough put in amusing performances before ""Star Trek: The Next  Generation"" and ""Murphy Brown"" made them television stars.But I think  the most fascinating thing about this work is its set design.  I'm not sure  I've ever seen a production with better use of scrim.  The stage literally  becomes an artist's canvas, with bits of scenery flying in and out as  needed by Patinkin's character.  It is a masterwork of design and anyone  studying stagecraft has to make a stop here.Likewise, anyone  interested in the business side of Broadway production will find the audio  commentary on the DVD especially intriguing.  Hearing how the production  came together is entirely instructive.  Also, there aren't too many DVD  audio commentaries which include major actors, so the presence of Mandy  Patinkin and Bernadette Peters here is altogether welcome.  Perhaps because  there was such a time gap between the play and the audio commentary (more  than ten years), the participants have had time to think about the  experience and put it in historical perspective.  As a result,  this audio  commentaries is one of the very best I've yet encountered on DVD.It  may be more interesting than the play itself.",5,Important work for all students of stagecraft,954288000,"03 29, 2000",2000,2459,"['story', '_Sunday', 'Park', 'George_', 'unusually', 'inaccessible', 'Sondheim', 'work', 'most', 'mass-appeal', 'pieces', 'such', '_Phantom', 'Opera_', 'playwright', 'play', 'be', 'sure', 'comprehensible', 'everyone', 'suspect', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'most', 'would', 'be', 'fellow', 'artists', 'Far', 'being', 'plot', 'driven', 'work', 'exploration', 'idea', 'work', 'ethic', 'raison', ""d'etre.Inasmuch"", 'plot', 'story', 'how', 'art', 'produced', 'struggle', 'delivered', 'backdrop', 'single', 'family', 'history', 'are', 'shown', 'generation', 'family', 'discover', 'how', 'struggle', 'produce', 'great', 'work', 'often', 'loved', 'ones', 'how', 'need', 'be', 'paid', 'often', 'artist', 'own', 'work.It', 'fascinating', 'ride', 'character', 'details', 'subtle', 'observation', 'angst', 'artistic', 'creation', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'such', 'work', 'so', ""'re"", 'one', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'buying.However', ""'re"", 'even', 'slightly', 'artistically', 'inclined', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'story', 'enriched', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'much', 'laugh', 'here', 'work', 'full', 'interesting', 'characters', 'surprising', 'character', 'actors', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'Charles', 'Kimbrough', 'put', 'amusing', 'performances', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'made', 'television', 'stars.But', 'think', 'most', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'work', 'set', 'design', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'production', 'better', 'use', 'scrim', 'stage', 'literally', 'artist', 'canvas', 'bits', 'scenery', 'flying', 'as', 'needed', 'Patinkin', 'character', 'masterwork', 'design', 'anyone', 'studying', 'stagecraft', 'make', 'stop', 'here.Likewise', 'anyone', 'interested', 'business', 'side', 'Broadway', 'production', 'will', 'find', 'audio', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'Hearing', 'how', 'production', 'came', 'together', 'entirely', 'instructive', 'Also', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'include', 'major', 'actors', 'presence', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'here', 'altogether', 'welcome', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'such', 'time', 'gap', 'play', 'audio', 'commentary', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'participants', 'have', 'had', 'time', 'think', 'experience', 'put', 'historical', 'perspective', 'result', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'one', 'very', 'best', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'encountered', 'DVD.It', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'play']",N/A
459023,A38JKOT65RLZ9Q,630530209X,Wayne Rossi,"[0, 0]","Though perhaps the later Passion was a greater Sondheim-Lapine collaboration, their first work - Sunday in the Park with George - remains a sensitive and delicate piece that merits contemplation.  It was preserved on video, and the preservation is generally solid.  The film work generally manages to capture where the audience attention would best be, and in such a visual show it does as well as film may to transcribe the essence.Sunday... is one of Sondheim's most pleasant scores for listening; it has a grace and majesty that mark it above much of his other work.  It is fortunately combined with a witty book and excellent direction on Lapine's part.  The central character of the first act, Georges Seurat, is portrayed with a certain distance and coldness by Mandy Patinkin that many consider off-putting; I think that this is more directorial bias than actor's intent, and Patinkin's work was indeed among his best here.  His romantic counterpart Dot is played with elegance and style by Bernadette Peters, at the prime of her career and in fine acting style.  The second act's George is a much more relatable character, and I think that Patinkin's portrayal here is much more likeable and enjoyable.  His work in &quot;Putting it Together&quot; alone is a masterpiece; Patinkin truly took the task of making two roles work.  Peters is understated, but well acted, until the finale where she is marvellous.  And the actual finale will raise more questions than it answers...for the show is really all about whether we choose to create children or art...in other words, romantic love or artistic devotion?  This is the question George must face, as Seurat faced it, and learn where his answer lies.The ensemble parts are amazing.  Fans can look for virtuoso performances by the likes of Brent Spiner and Charles Kimbrough.  Everyone takes on the challenge of two different roles, two different worlds, and does so as gracefully and well as the leads.  The result is a marvellous show that is sadly not produced all that much; the presence of the DVD record, though, makes up for it generously.  It cannot be missed by any fan of serious musicals.",5,A solid record of a brilliant show.,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,2155,"['perhaps', 'later', 'Passion', 'was', 'greater', 'Sondheim-Lapine', 'collaboration', 'first', 'work', 'Sunday', 'Park', 'George', 'sensitive', 'delicate', 'piece', 'contemplation', 'was', 'preserved', 'video', 'preservation', 'generally', 'solid', 'film', 'work', 'generally', 'capture', 'where', 'audience', 'attention', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'such', 'visual', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'may', 'transcribe', 'essence.Sunday', 'one', 'Sondheim', 'most', 'pleasant', 'scores', 'listening', 'grace', 'majesty', 'much', 'other', 'work', 'fortunately', 'combined', 'witty', 'book', 'excellent', 'direction', 'Lapine', 'part', 'central', 'character', 'first', 'act', 'Georges', 'Seurat', 'portrayed', 'certain', 'distance', 'coldness', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'many', 'consider', 'off-putting', 'think', 'more', 'directorial', 'bias', 'actor', 'intent', 'Patinkin', 'work', 'was', 'indeed', 'best', 'here', 'romantic', 'counterpart', 'Dot', 'played', 'elegance', 'style', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'prime', 'career', 'fine', 'acting', 'style', 'second', 'act', 'George', 'much', 'more', 'relatable', 'character', 'think', 'Patinkin', 'portrayal', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'enjoyable', 'work', 'quot', 'Putting', 'Together', 'quot', 'alone', 'masterpiece', 'Patinkin', 'truly', 'took', 'task', 'making', 'two', 'roles', 'work', 'Peters', 'understated', 'well', 'acted', 'finale', 'where', 'marvellous', 'actual', 'finale', 'will', 'raise', 'more', 'questions', 'show', 'really', 'choose', 'create', 'children', 'art', 'other', 'words', 'romantic', 'love', 'artistic', 'devotion', 'question', 'George', 'must', 'face', 'Seurat', 'faced', 'learn', 'where', 'answer', 'lies.The', 'ensemble', 'parts', 'are', 'amazing', 'Fans', 'can', 'look', 'virtuoso', 'performances', 'likes', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'Charles', 'Kimbrough', 'Everyone', 'challenge', 'two', 'different', 'roles', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'so', 'gracefully', 'well', 'leads', 'result', 'marvellous', 'show', 'sadly', 'not', 'produced', 'that', 'much', 'presence', 'DVD', 'record', 'up', 'generously', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'fan', 'serious', 'musicals']",N/A
