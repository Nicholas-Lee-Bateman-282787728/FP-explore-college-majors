There's no war, nor patriotism in play, it's simply a question of police and maintaining order, and that village doesn't need more revolvers and, in the other side, it seems a comfortable place to live.

700644,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0000665SN,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 3]","""Death of a Gunfighter"" is a 1969 color western about the passing of the old west, and is one of the earlier ""revisionist westerns"".  Prime examples of revisionist westerns include ""Little Big Man"" (1970), ""Soldier Blue"" (1970), ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" (1971), ""Dirty Little Billy"" (1972), and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976).Rugged Richard Widmark plays an old time sheriff who has outlived his usefulness for the turn of the century civilized town. Widmark was nominated for an Oscar and winner of a Golden Globe for his debut film (""Kiss of Death"", 1947) and also nominated for an Emmy for ""Vanished"" (1971). Widmark appeared in more than 50 films, initially as a villain but increasing as a hero. He was a staple in Westerns - ""The Last Wagon"" (1956), ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964), ""Death of a Gunfighter"" (1969), etc.Lena Horne (1917-2010) plays Widmark's girlfriend. Horne is best known as a singer, one of the reasons the Cotton Club was such an icon. But she also managed to get in 9 films including the all black ""Stormy Weather"" (1943) from which she made her signature theme song.John Saxon (1935) plays the county Marshall and an old friend of Widmark. Saxon won a Golden Globe as Most Promising Newcomer (1958) and was nominated for ""The Appaloosa"" (1966). He made more than 100 films, including a starring role in ""Enter the Dragon"" (1973).Carroll O'Connor plays a saloon owner who is worried that Widmark is keeping his business down. O'Connor is best known to us as from his TV roles as Archie Bunker from ""All in the Family"" (1971 - 1979) and the Police Chief from ""In the Heat of the Night"" - he won Oscars for both roles.The townsfolk are populated with some great character actors (Royal Dano, David Opatoshu, Dub Taylor, Harry Carey Jr.) but none of them have much to say or doDirector Don Siegel (1912-91) was one of the most popular directors of the late 20th century. Although he never won an Oscar or a DGA, his films were consistently well received - ""Escape from Alcatraz"" (1979), ""Dirty Harry"" (1971), ""The Shootist"" (1976), ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" (1970). My favorite Don Siegel film is one of his early ones - ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956).FWIW - Siegel replaced Robert Totten as director, and when it came time to list credits, Siegel felt Totten had done more on the film than he did, but star Widmark who had fired Totten didn't want Totten to get credit, so the credits list a fictitious name.In 1969 ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" was the big box office king, followed by ""The Shoot Horses Don't They?"", ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", and ""Easy Rider"". ""True Grit"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" rounded off the top 10. So it was a great year for westerns. The big Oscar winner was ""Midnight Cowboy"" (Picture, Director) and John Wayne won his only Oscar for ""True Grit"". Other notable films that year were ""Hello Dolly"", ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", ""Putney Swope"" and ""Z"". Comedy westerns were in vogue with ""The Good Guys and the Bad Guys"", ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" and ""Paint Your Wagon"".The Chicago Tribune's Roger Ebert called the film ""an extraordinary western"" and said it was one of Widmark's ""best, most fully realized performances."" The NY Times called Widmark ""a splendid actor"" and praised the supporting cast but thought the script was lacking.While Widmark's acting is good, we don't see much of Lena Horne, and none of the townsfolk's characters are well developed. Moreover, the end is fairly predictable. What might have been an A westerns turns out to be just another B western.There are many films about the changing of the west, and if this period appeals to you, here are some of the best - ""Will Penny"" (1968), ""Monte Walsh"" (1970), ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (1969), ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), ""The Shootist"" (1976), ""The Man who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962).Bottom line - a B western that will appeal to fans of Richard Widmark.",3,B western,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,3960,"['Death', 'Gunfighter', '1969', 'color', 'western', 'passing', 'old', 'west', 'one', 'earlier', 'revisionist', 'westerns', 'Prime', 'examples', 'revisionist', 'westerns', 'include', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', '1970', 'Soldier', 'Blue', '1970', 'McCabe', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', '1971', 'Dirty', 'Little', 'Billy', '1972', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', '1976', '.Rugged', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'old', 'time', 'sheriff', 'who', 'outlived', 'usefulness', 'turn', 'century', 'civilized', 'town', 'Widmark', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'debut', 'film', 'Kiss', 'Death', '1947', 'also', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'Vanished', '1971', 'Widmark', 'appeared', 'more', '50', 'films', 'initially', 'villain', 'increasing', 'hero', 'was', 'staple', 'Westerns', 'Last', 'Wagon', '1956', 'Two', 'Rode', 'Together', '1961', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', '1964', 'Death', 'Gunfighter', '1969', 'etc.Lena', 'Horne', '1917-2010', 'Widmark', 'girlfriend', 'Horne', 'best', 'known', 'singer', 'one', 'reasons', 'Cotton', 'Club', 'was', 'such', 'icon', 'also', 'managed', 'get', '9', 'films', 'including', 'black', 'Stormy', 'Weather', '1943', 'made', 'signature', 'theme', 'song.John', 'Saxon', '1935', 'county', 'Marshall', 'old', 'friend', 'Widmark', 'Saxon', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Most', 'Promising', 'Newcomer', '1958', 'was', 'nominated', 'Appaloosa', '1966', 'made', 'more', '100', 'films', 'including', 'starring', 'role', 'Enter', 'Dragon', '1973', '.Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'saloon', 'owner', 'who', 'worried', 'Widmark', 'keeping', 'business', 'down', ""O'Connor"", 'best', 'known', 'TV', 'roles', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'Family', '1971', '1979', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Heat', 'Night', 'won', 'Oscars', 'roles.The', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'populated', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'Royal', 'Dano', 'David', 'Opatoshu', 'Dub', 'Taylor', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'none', 'have', 'much', 'say', 'doDirector', 'Don', 'Siegel', '1912-91', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'directors', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'never', 'won', 'Oscar', 'DGA', 'films', 'were', 'consistently', 'well', 'received', 'Escape', 'Alcatraz', '1979', 'Dirty', 'Harry', '1971', 'Shootist', '1976', 'Two', 'Mules', 'Sister', 'Sara', '1970', 'favorite', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'film', 'one', 'early', 'ones', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', '1956', '.FWIW', 'Siegel', 'replaced', 'Robert', 'Totten', 'director', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'list', 'credits', 'Siegel', 'felt', 'Totten', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'film', 'did', 'star', 'Widmark', 'who', 'had', 'fired', 'Totten', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Totten', 'get', 'credit', 'credits', 'list', 'fictitious', 'name.In', '1969', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'was', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'king', 'followed', 'Shoot', 'Horses', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'True', 'Grit', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'rounded', 'off', 'top', '10', 'was', 'great', 'year', 'westerns', 'big', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'was', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'Picture', 'Director', 'John', 'Wayne', 'won', 'only', 'Oscar', 'True', 'Grit', 'Other', 'notable', 'films', 'year', 'were', 'Hello', 'Dolly', 'Once', 'Time', 'West', 'Putney', 'Swope', 'Z', 'Comedy', 'westerns', 'were', 'vogue', 'Good', 'Guys', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'Paint', 'Wagon', '.The', 'Chicago', 'Tribune', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'called', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'western', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'Widmark', 'best', 'most', 'fully', 'realized', 'performances', 'NY', 'Times', 'called', 'Widmark', 'splendid', 'actor', 'praised', 'supporting', 'cast', 'thought', 'script', 'was', 'lacking.While', 'Widmark', 'acting', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'none', 'townsfolk', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'Moreover', 'end', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'A', 'westerns', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'B', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'changing', 'west', 'period', 'appeals', 'here', 'are', 'best', 'Will', 'Penny', '1968', 'Monte', 'Walsh', '1970', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', '1969', 'Wild', 'Bunch', '1969', 'Shootist', '1976', 'Man', 'who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valance', '1962', '.Bottom', 'line', 'B', 'western', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'Richard', 'Widmark']",N/A

I've always liked watching a good western, and this is one. I highly recommend this movie- especially if you don't object to the interracial love affair between Frank and Claire. I think they make a great couple, and one of the movie's highlights is their wedding. My only regret is they don't get to live happily ever after, but it's fun watching them together for the duration of the movie. They have an ease with one another on the screen, and share a good chemistry between them.""Death of a Gunfighter"" was originally named ""Patch,"" Richard Widmark's character's last name. The name of the film was later changed. This is the story of Frank Patch, sheriff of a small town in the early 1900s. He's been sheriff for 20 years, and after several deadly shootouts, with Patch being the lone survivor, the local townspeople are fed up with his methods of law and order, and want him out of office- no matter what. His only supporters are Dan, a good, loyal young man who is like a son to him, and Claire, his girlfriend of many years, played by Lena Horne, who is breathtakingly beautiful in this film. After more deaths, and more opposition, including from Lester, brilliantly played by Carroll O' Connor, a visit from old friend Lou, played by John Saxon, who also tries to convince him to give up the job, Frank marries Claire. Watch for the big showdown that takes place after their wedding...I really like the cast of this movie. Widmark, Horne, and O' Connor I particularly enjoy watching, each lighting up the screen. It's also refreshing seeing Lena Horne in a dramatic, non-musical role, although she does sing ""Sweet Apple Wine"" at the beginning, and the end. Her acting skills shine, along with her grace and beauty. I've noticed a lot of her acting ability is non-verbal. She says a lot with her eyes. I can't picture anyone else in this role but her. Richard Widmark is great as tough-guy Patch. I love him in those strong, tough-guy parts.The film was shot during the summer of 1968, and released a year later by Universal.

700653,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B0000665SN,Terence Allen,"[9, 9]","Death of A Gunfighter is a great example of the late 60's/ early 70's Western subgenre that overtook the genre during that time period. These films tended to be cynical in nature, and to either have as their focus anti-heroes who were nothing like the heroic, admirable heroes of traditional Westerns, or they would feature a traditional hero was found to be unfashionable or out-of-touch with modern times. These films often took place at the turn of the century when lightbulbs, automobiles and telephones were coming into fashion.Death of A Gunfighter takes place during the turn of the century, and features a traditional virtuous Western hero in the person of veteran Western actor Richard Widmark. He plays Frank Patch, an old-style marshal in the town of Cottonwood Springs. Cottonwood Springs fancies itself as a progressive, up-and-coming town, except that is, for its outmoded law officer. When Patch has to kill a drunk gunning for him, he is asked to resign, he refuses, culminating in a spiralling sequence of events.Widmark is great, and has a wonderful supporting cast behind him, including Lena Horne and Carroll O'Connor, and a bevy of great Western supporting actors, including Victor French, Royal Dano, Jacqueline Scott, and Morgan Woodward.Death of A Gunfighter is a great film that typifies the times in which it was made.",4,Great Late 60's Western With A Great Cast,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,1344,"['Death', 'A', 'Gunfighter', 'great', 'example', 'late', ""60's/"", 'early', '70', 'Western', 'subgenre', 'overtook', 'genre', 'time', 'period', 'films', 'tended', 'be', 'cynical', 'nature', 'either', 'have', 'focus', 'anti-heroes', 'who', 'were', 'nothing', 'heroic', 'admirable', 'heroes', 'traditional', 'Westerns', 'would', 'feature', 'traditional', 'hero', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'unfashionable', 'out-of-touch', 'modern', 'times', 'films', 'often', 'took', 'place', 'turn', 'century', 'when', 'lightbulbs', 'automobiles', 'telephones', 'were', 'coming', 'fashion.Death', 'A', 'Gunfighter', 'place', 'turn', 'century', 'traditional', 'virtuous', 'Western', 'hero', 'person', 'veteran', 'Western', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Frank', 'Patch', 'old-style', 'marshal', 'town', 'Cottonwood', 'Springs', 'Cottonwood', 'Springs', 'progressive', 'up-and-coming', 'town', 'outmoded', 'law', 'officer', 'When', 'Patch', 'kill', 'drunk', 'gunning', 'asked', 'resign', 'culminating', 'spiralling', 'sequence', 'events.Widmark', 'great', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'bevy', 'great', 'Western', 'supporting', 'actors', 'including', 'Victor', 'French', 'Royal', 'Dano', 'Jacqueline', 'Scott', 'Morgan', 'Woodward.Death', 'A', 'Gunfighter', 'great', 'film', 'times', 'was', 'made']",N/A
