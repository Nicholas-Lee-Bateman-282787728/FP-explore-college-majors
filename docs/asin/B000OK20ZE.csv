Robert Newton is excellent; if you've only seen him in Disney's Treasure Island, you haven't seen his full range as an actor.  This Korean import DVD from World Digital Entertainment is an excellent trsnsfer.  The photography is as clear as a bell, and sound is excellent.

When the opportunity to purchase the disc presented itself I took advantage of the opportunity.This is a good study of people (no matter where they call home) and in particular the upclose representation of the typical Brit throughout the years.

Sometimes, but with 20-20 hindsight, not always.  If I were teaching 20th Century British History I just might include this film for its truths.  I imagine it was a morale booster.

1064620,A3QEPSZ62L6BU5,B000OK20ZE,Julius Weber,"[0, 0]",David Lean and Noel Coward at their best. For several years the only copies were in black and white but this color transfer to dvd is excellent and recovers the film's original charm. There were some fairly cutting comments when the film first appeared over the casting of Celia Johnson but I think she did an extremely good job and to me (as a Londoner) she epitomizes that special London spirit. Robert Newton shows his great acting talent and of course John Mills as the young sailor from next door and (his father) Stanley Holloway are superb. It's total nostalgia and something I love greatly.,5,David Lean and Noel Coward at their best,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,598,"['David', 'Lean', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'best', 'several', 'years', 'only', 'copies', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'transfer', 'dvd', 'excellent', 'film', 'original', 'charm', 'were', 'fairly', 'cutting', 'comments', 'when', 'film', 'first', 'appeared', 'casting', 'Celia', 'Johnson', 'think', 'did', 'extremely', 'good', 'job', 'Londoner', 'special', 'London', 'spirit', 'Robert', 'Newton', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'course', 'John', 'Mills', 'young', 'sailor', 'next', 'door', 'father', 'Stanley', 'Holloway', 'are', 'superb', 'total', 'nostalgia', 'something', 'love', 'greatly']","David Lean's This Happy Breed ~ by Noel Coward and Ronald Neame [Import, All-regions] (1944)"
1064621,AMAWA346T2D3L,B000OK20ZE,"Le Stryge ""in OZ""","[1, 1]","If you too are of a certain vintage, you'll no doubt recognise relatives and people you knew ""way back"" in this quite fascinating film.The story?Well it's really about an extended working class British family's time living in a specific house for about 22 years. They move in just as WWI has ended, and move out just as WWII is about to begin. We never see any of the former, and only Neville Chamberlain ironically waving that piece of worthless paper that promised ""Peace in our time"" of the latter.What happens here are the usual family things, the entertainments, the domestic arguments both petty and serious, the bickering and tender moments, the crises and tragedies, ...in fact just life actually.Of course the morality is that of an earlier time, with family disgrace always being a threat for what now would hardly be considered transgressions of huge proportion, but you truly grow to care what happens to the characters, and they are most definitely human, with flaws and vanities as well as their admirable qualities.I particularly enjoy the testy relationship between the grandmother and the aunt. It's a constant battle for emotional sympathy, with wounded feelings and wounding words being exchanged. Often dryly witty, always ending with one or the other retreating huffily, threatening to ""never speak to you again, I'm sure!""My very favourite lines are those of the Father, who rails against the aunt's constant use of several euphemisms for dying!Women's emancipation has not yet hit, and so the females here tend to be long-suffering and resigned to their subservient roles, but of course this was a fact of the times.The one daughter who rebels against this social constraint finds it very hard going, ....and her redemption comes only in the form of once again toeing the line of ""respectability"".There are genuine moments in this film, some happy and some quite touching, and you are made to feel as though you can share them all. It's certainly not ""glamorised"" in any way. These are genuine people without botox, boob-jobs, teeth whitening or hair-straighteners. One never gets the feeling a whole crew of makeup artists is just waiting to pounce the second the director calls ""Cut"".The acting is quite restrained here too,...something we are certainly not used to in current American cinema. Massive displays of histrionics and personal emotion were considered very poor form by the Brits back then.Yes it's nostalgic now, and reminiscent of a far simpler time when roles were distinct and expectations from life were far more modest than what people with their overblown sense of self-entitlement demand now.This movie probably provides quite a genuine look at the social structure of the time. The very strong sense of duty, and the stiff determination of the Brits to never give in to despair, no matter what life may throw at them. Family, and that's family with all their foibles and frailties , are what counts. That, and getting by and making do.I've watched this movie several times now, although this is the first time I've seen it in colour.It's a Korean version, ....don't forget to turn off the Korean subtitles first up, as otherwise they play automatically and become very distracting.The transfer is nothing special, perfectly ""watchable"", although grainy in parts, but again this actually adds to the period feel of the piece and is completely in harmony with the muted and faded colours representing the interiors of English working class families of the time.The sets themselves are a wonderful observation of life between the wars, with cretonne curtains, uncut moquette upholstery, and those tea-coloured rose wallpapers that were so ubiquitous.I'm sure at least a couple of characters will resonate with most adult viewers here, and it's a most enjoyable journey to be a fly-on-the-wall and party to the problems and joys of a simpler time in history.",5,Making the Best of
