Oh Police Academy 2 is PG-13 for Lauguage and brief nudity. 3 is PG for Lauguage and action scenes.Update: again this disc has both films and is double sided hello. i guess the guy in the review below did'nt bother to check the other side of the disc before complaining in his review. oh brother some people make me crazy.",4,Great Deal Police Academy Films.,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,834,"['great', 'deal', 'films', 'disc', 'downside', 'double', 'sided', 'disc', 'also', 'good', 'thing', 'films', 'are', 'widescreen', 'so', 'great', 'warners', 'brothers', 'do', 'are', 'police', 'academy', 'fan', 'then', 'kinda', 'deal', 'get', 'two', 'films', 'such', 'low', 'price', 'only', 'reason', 'i', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'transfer', 'picture', 'films', 'little', 'dark', 'maybe', 'dvd', 'player', 'i', ""'m"", 'using', 'oh', 'well', 'good', 'deal', 'anyway', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'side', 'Oh', 'Police', 'Academy', '2', 'PG-13', 'Lauguage', 'brief', 'nudity', '3', 'PG', 'Lauguage', 'action', 'scenes.Update', 'again', 'disc', 'films', 'double', 'sided', 'hello', 'i', 'guess', 'guy', 'review', ""did'nt"", 'bother', 'check', 'other', 'side', 'disc', 'complaining', 'review', 'oh', 'people', 'make', 'crazy']",N/A

I guess now as I am older, I understand the storylines. Back then, I just watched the movie to see crazy cops. Part 2 was better now, because I thought it was a huge dropoff from part 1. Part 2 isn't bad, I love that fat sloppy guy who played Mohoney's partner, the guy who got his hands stuck to his hair in the showers, and the Howard Hessman character who got spray painted. Part 3 to me is the prime of the characters. The crew really gets into gear here.
