418428,A2WLZD9BY669HY,630438954X,Candace Scott,"[22, 22]","This is a fascinating and intense movie, a classic of its genre and one which is teeming with repressed sexuality. The two lead performers, James Mason and Ann Todd, were romantically involved throughout the making of this film and had an affair in real life (as Todd later admitted). Their chemistry is quite palpable, though not in the same way as Tracy and Hepburn; the entire movie is an exercise is repression, caution and masked motions. In fact, with a few exceptions, neither star even touches one another throughout the movie, but there is more overt sex here than in many more graphic films. One must simply strain harder to discern it.Mason is beautifully wicked here, his evil nature and sadism are extremely attractive to watch. Ann Todd is a repressed and frightened pianist who suffers to horror of having Mason slam his cane down upon her hands while she scales the keyboard. Delicious! This scene, above any other, catapulted James Mason to the forefront of British cinema stars. Watch the scene where a white kitty is curled on his lap as he dourly pets it and stares daggers as Todd in the background. You can cut the psychological melodrama here with a thick butter knife.This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you appreciate a beautiful man in Mason, a terrified lamb of a starlet like Ann Todd, and an adroit and mature screenplay, then watch &quot;The Seventh Veil.&quot; It has worn very well in the ensuing decades and still makes for gripping viewing.",4,An understated and elegant movie,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,1479,"['fascinating', 'intense', 'movie', 'classic', 'genre', 'one', 'teeming', 'repressed', 'sexuality', 'two', 'lead', 'performers', 'James', 'Mason', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'were', 'romantically', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'had', 'affair', 'real', 'life', 'Todd', 'later', 'admitted', 'chemistry', 'quite', 'palpable', 'not', 'same', 'way', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'entire', 'movie', 'exercise', 'repression', 'caution', 'masked', 'motions', 'fact', 'few', 'exceptions', 'star', 'even', 'one', 'movie', 'more', 'overt', 'sex', 'here', 'many', 'more', 'graphic', 'films', 'One', 'must', 'simply', 'strain', 'harder', 'discern', 'it.Mason', 'beautifully', 'wicked', 'here', 'evil', 'nature', 'sadism', 'are', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'watch', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'repressed', 'frightened', 'pianist', 'who', 'horror', 'having', 'Mason', 'slam', 'cane', 'down', 'hands', 'keyboard', 'Delicious', 'scene', 'other', 'catapulted', 'James', 'Mason', 'forefront', 'British', 'cinema', 'stars', 'Watch', 'scene', 'where', 'white', 'kitty', 'curled', 'lap', 'dourly', 'daggers', 'Todd', 'background', 'can', 'cut', 'psychological', 'melodrama', 'here', 'thick', 'butter', 'knife.This', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'appreciate', 'beautiful', 'man', 'Mason', 'terrified', 'lamb', 'starlet', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'adroit', 'mature', 'screenplay', 'then', 'watch', 'quot', 'Seventh', 'Veil.', 'quot', 'worn', 'very', 'well', 'ensuing', 'decades', 'still', 'gripping', 'viewing']",Seventh Veil VHS

I shudder to think of it really but let's not go there....let us go back to 1946, when this film was released.  For it's time it was a dark, yet highly entertaining and popular, well received film!  The casting of Ann Todd as Francesca Cunningham and James Mason, as Nicholas in the all important roles make it a must see for fans. She is the orphaned and innocent young girl who lives her life through and loves the piano and he, the embattled, embittered cripple of a man who is a distant cousin thrice removed who becomes her guardian. Hers was not at all a wonderful existence under his female despising, confirmed bachelor's thumb and yet, it is he that molds her into the world renowned concert pianist she becomes.  His tutelage borders on the cruel and yet, he has a saving grace. Through the years of training and giving his life to her success we see a love, of sorts, develop. As Francesca comes of age she discovers, much to her surprise, she is an attractive young woman.  An older fellow student and already established musician falls in love with her and she with him.  Nicholas soon sees to it that nothing will come between his vision of her true place in life and he takes her away from him, escaping to Europe for further instruction and concert success.  Through the years, however, another love finds her and she is set to elope with him when an automobile accident befalls them.  Francesca has had her hands burned in the wreck and it is her hands she has been so frightened of injuring ever since they were caned when she was a girl in boarding school for a small infraction of the rules and who could not, then, compete in an important competition at school for a musical scholarship!  Francesca is so distraught and worried for her hands she attempts suicide and it is from this failed attempt we first meet her psychiatrist, Dr. Larsen, who is very amply played by the wonderful actor, Herbert Lom, Since her attempt she has become semi-comatose and he cannot reach her.  He wishes to bring her back to reality through hypnosis but must first elicit the consent of Nicholas, her only known relation and mentor. What Dr. Larsen discovers through this hypnosis brings the three men in her life back together under the same roof...for this is from where her underlying problem actually stems. Francesca must not only find her hands are indeed intact and can still play but she also, against all odds, must discover who it is she truly loves and wishes to be together with for her lifetime. It is here, dear reader, that I will leave you to discover, who it is to be...for this is a must see film of Academy Award proportions!",4,The Seventh Veil: An Important Psychological Film,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,2726,"['Ohhhhh', 'what', 'could', 'make', 'James', 'Mason', 'performance', 'today', 'standards', 'shudder', 'think', 'really', 'let', 'not', 'go', 'there', '.let', 'go', 'back', '1946', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'was', 'dark', 'yet', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'popular', 'well', 'received', 'film', 'casting', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'Francesca', 'Cunningham', 'James', 'Mason', 'Nicholas', 'important', 'roles', 'make', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'orphaned', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'life', 'piano', 'embattled', 'embittered', 'cripple', 'man', 'who', 'distant', 'cousin', 'thrice', 'removed', 'who', 'guardian', 'Hers', 'was', 'not', 'wonderful', 'existence', 'female', 'despising', 'confirmed', 'bachelor', 'thumb', 'yet', 'world', 'renowned', 'concert', 'pianist', 'tutelage', 'borders', 'cruel', 'yet', 'saving', 'grace', 'years', 'training', 'giving', 'life', 'success', 'see', 'love', 'sorts', 'develop', 'Francesca', 'age', 'much', 'surprise', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'older', 'fellow', 'student', 'already', 'established', 'musician', 'falls', 'love', 'soon', 'sees', 'nothing', 'will', 'come', 'vision', 'true', 'place', 'life', 'away', 'escaping', 'Europe', 'further', 'instruction', 'concert', 'success', 'years', 'however', 'love', 'set', 'elope', 'when', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Francesca', 'had', 'hands', 'burned', 'wreck', 'hands', 'been', 'so', 'frightened', 'injuring', 'ever', 'were', 'caned', 'when', 'was', 'girl', 'boarding', 'school', 'small', 'infraction', 'rules', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'then', 'compete', 'important', 'competition', 'school', 'musical', 'scholarship', 'Francesca', 'so', 'distraught', 'worried', 'hands', 'suicide', 'failed', 'attempt', 'first', 'meet', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Larsen', 'who', 'very', 'amply', 'played', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'attempt', 'become', 'semi-comatose', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'bring', 'back', 'reality', 'hypnosis', 'must', 'first', 'elicit', 'consent', 'Nicholas', 'only', 'known', 'relation', 'mentor', 'What', 'Dr.', 'Larsen', 'hypnosis', 'three', 'men', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'same', 'roof', 'where', 'underlying', 'problem', 'actually', 'Francesca', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'find', 'hands', 'are', 'indeed', 'intact', 'can', 'still', 'play', 'also', 'odds', 'must', 'discover', 'who', 'truly', 'loves', 'wishes', 'be', 'together', 'lifetime', 'here', 'dear', 'reader', 'will', 'leave', 'discover', 'who', 'be', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'Academy', 'Award', 'proportions']",Seventh Veil VHS
418430,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,630438954X,C. O. DeRiemer,"[8, 8]","One of the most delicious thrills for many British and American moviegoers in 1946 was the unexpected sight of James Mason thwacking down his cane on the fingers of Ann Todd as she played the piano. This one scene is probably better remembered than the movie itself. The Seventh Veil was one of the first British movies to deal with psychiatry; it made a lot of money in both countries; it helped propel Mason to Hollywood; and it undoubtedly is one of the great romance melodramas in movies. Surprisingly, after more than 60 years the movie still holds up reasonably well, thanks to Mason and Todd. Please note that elements of the plot are discussedRomance melodrama? Just hear the names of the two leads...Nicholas and Francesca. If those names don't sound like characters in a steamy Regency romance, what would? But the movie actually is a modern (from the Forties) study of a severely shy young woman's repressed need for love, and her guardian's overbearing need to live his life's dream through her and her talent as a pianist. Francesca's mother had died when she was a child. Her father placed her in a boarding school. When he died, she was 15 and was sent to live with her wealthy guardian in a large London mansion. Francesca was timid, talented at the piano, so unsure of herself at times that she could barely speak. Nicholas, probably 20 years older, was her second cousin. He lived alone in his mansion with only male servants. He was lame, brooding, controlling and a misogynist. One afternoon he learns Francesca can play the piano and slowly entices her to play for him by playing himself. As he listens to her we can see that he is recognizing a rare talent that he most likely, however competent he might be, can never equal. ""He was a wonderful teacher,"" she later says. ""He used to say rather bitterly, 'Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.'"" He drives her mercilessly for years to train her to excel, and he succeeds. ""He never let me out of his sight for seven years,"" she tells us, ""It was seven years of music...of Nicholas turning me into his dream.""We learn all this in a series of flashbacks because we first meet Francesca in a hospital after she has attempted to kill herself. She lies mute in bed, seemingly unaware of anything around her. When finally a psychiatrist, Dr. Larsen (Herbert Lom, wearing a scholarly pince-nez), is brought into the case, he slowly encourages her to speak and tell her story. He tells a colleague that the process is much like the removal of the seven veils, with each dropped veil revealing a bit more, and that the removal of the seventh veil will let us know the patient's truest feelings and desires. And so Francesca tells us in flashback how Nicholas drove her to become a gifted, recognized pianist, how he controlled every aspect of her life, how she thought she had fallen in love with two men and how Nicholas had reacted each time. Finally, Dr. Larsen is able to help Francesca through this. At the conclusion, as she walks down the grand staircase in Nicholas' mansion with Dr. Larsen and the three men waiting below, we know that, as Larsen has warned them, Francesca has become a new woman who will go to the man among them whom she loves and trusts. And as she goes down those stairs, smiling and confident, Nicholas knows that the man Larsen described cannot be him. He quietly limps away and closes the door to his study behind him. Care to guess what Francesca does next?The movie still works, despite the now clunky approach to psychiatry, repressed love and inner-most feelings, because of James Mason and Ann Todd. Todd was a cool, finely-sculpted blonde who, at 36, had to convincingly play a young woman between the ages of 15 and about 24. She just about carries it off. She also has to carry the narrative weight of the movie, since all we know is largely from her flashback monologues and her scenes in the film. Mason, however, dark and handsome, dominates the movie. He isn't just glowering, brooding and tormented. There is an element of sadistic insistence in his portrayal of Nicholas that keeps us off balance. If Nicholas had ever reached the point of doing some bodice ripping, there would have been a lot of females, and some males, in the audience sighing in anticipation.The Seventh Veil was an important movie of its time. This Region 2 DVD from Britan  is a good reason to go out and buy an all-region DVD player. Amazon sells them. Among the film's pleasures are excerpts of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata and Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto.",4,James Mason's cane...Ann Todd's fingers playing the piano...The Seventh Veil still has its moments,1246492800,"07 2, 2009",2009,4556,"['One', 'most', 'delicious', 'thrills', 'many', 'British', 'American', 'moviegoers', '1946', 'was', 'unexpected', 'sight', 'James', 'Mason', 'thwacking', 'down', 'cane', 'fingers', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'played', 'piano', 'one', 'scene', 'probably', 'better', 'remembered', 'movie', 'Seventh', 'Veil', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'British', 'movies', 'deal', 'psychiatry', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'countries', 'helped', 'propel', 'Mason', 'Hollywood', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'great', 'romance', 'melodramas', 'movies', 'Surprisingly', 'more', '60', 'years', 'movie', 'still', 'up', 'reasonably', 'well', 'thanks', 'Mason', 'Todd', 'Please', 'note', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'discussedRomance', 'melodrama', 'Just', 'hear', 'names', 'two', 'leads', 'Nicholas', 'Francesca', 'names', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'characters', 'steamy', 'Regency', 'romance', 'what', 'would', 'movie', 'actually', 'modern', 'Forties', 'study', 'severely', 'shy', 'young', 'woman', 'repressed', 'need', 'love', 'guardian', 'overbearing', 'need', 'live', 'life', 'dream', 'talent', 'pianist', 'Francesca', 'mother', 'had', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'father', 'placed', 'boarding', 'school', 'When', 'died', 'was', '15', 'was', 'sent', 'live', 'wealthy', 'guardian', 'large', 'London', 'mansion', 'Francesca', 'was', 'timid', 'talented', 'piano', 'unsure', 'herself', 'times', 'could', 'barely', 'speak', 'Nicholas', 'probably', '20', 'years', 'older', 'was', 'second', 'cousin', 'lived', 'alone', 'mansion', 'only', 'male', 'servants', 'was', 'lame', 'brooding', 'controlling', 'misogynist', 'One', 'afternoon', 'Francesca', 'can', 'play', 'piano', 'slowly', 'play', 'playing', 'can', 'see', 'recognizing', 'rare', 'talent', 'most', 'likely', 'however', 'competent', 'might', 'be', 'can', 'never', 'equal', 'was', 'wonderful', 'teacher', 'later', 'used', 'say', 'rather', 'bitterly', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'teach', 'mercilessly', 'years', 'train', 'excel', 'never', 'let', 'sight', 'seven', 'years', 'was', 'seven', 'years', 'music', 'Nicholas', 'turning', 'dream', 'learn', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'meet', 'Francesca', 'hospital', 'attempted', 'kill', 'mute', 'bed', 'seemingly', 'unaware', 'anything', 'When', 'finally', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Larsen', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'wearing', 'scholarly', 'pince-nez', 'brought', 'case', 'slowly', 'speak', 'tell', 'story', 'colleague', 'process', 'much', 'removal', 'seven', 'veils', 'dropped', 'veil', 'revealing', 'bit', 'more', 'removal', 'seventh', 'veil', 'will', 'let', 'know', 'patient', 'truest', 'feelings', 'desires', 'so', 'Francesca', 'flashback', 'how', 'Nicholas', 'drove', 'become', 'gifted', 'recognized', 'pianist', 'how', 'controlled', 'aspect', 'life', 'how', 'thought', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'how', 'Nicholas', 'had', 'reacted', 'time', 'Finally', 'Dr.', 'Larsen', 'able', 'help', 'Francesca', 'conclusion', 'grand', 'staircase', 'Nicholas', 'mansion', 'Dr.', 'Larsen', 'three', 'men', 'waiting', 'know', 'that', 'Larsen', 'warned', 'Francesca', 'become', 'new', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'man', 'whom', 'trusts', 'down', 'stairs', 'smiling', 'confident', 'Nicholas', 'man', 'Larsen', 'described', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'quietly', 'away', 'door', 'study', 'Care', 'guess', 'what', 'Francesca', 'next', 'movie', 'still', 'now', 'approach', 'psychiatry', 'repressed', 'love', 'inner-most', 'feelings', 'James', 'Mason', 'Ann', 'Todd', 'Todd', 'was', 'cool', 'finely-sculpted', 'blonde', 'who', '36', 'had', 'convincingly', 'play', 'young', 'woman', 'ages', '15', '24', 'just', 'off', 'also', 'carry', 'narrative', 'weight', 'movie', 'know', 'largely', 'flashback', 'monologues', 'scenes', 'film', 'Mason', 'however', 'dark', 'handsome', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'glowering', 'brooding', 'tormented', 'element', 'sadistic', 'insistence', 'portrayal', 'Nicholas', 'off', 'balance', 'Nicholas', 'had', 'ever', 'reached', 'point', 'doing', 'bodice', 'ripping', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'females', 'males', 'audience', 'sighing', 'anticipation.The', 'Seventh', 'Veil', 'was', 'important', 'movie', 'time', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'Britan', 'good', 'reason', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'all-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'Amazon', 'film', 'pleasures', 'are', 'excerpts', 'Beethoven', 'Pathetique', 'Sonata', 'Rachmaninoff', 'Second', 'Piano', 'Concerto']",Seventh Veil VHS
