778677,A1XKI53W1E891T,B0000DI86N,Amy,"[5, 5]","Giuseppe Verdi borrowed liberally from writers Victor Hugo and William Shakespeare, and so it's ironically appropriate that Verdi's life has all the earmarks of a Shakespearian tragic hero, complete with tragic flaw. Music is his strength, but also his weakness. He has the passion to feel love, but not passion enough to boldly go after love. Opera lovers will find themselves absorbed by the operatic treatment of Verdi's life, which includes many scenes performed from Verdi operas: Nabucco, Ernani, Rigoletto, Trovatore, Traviata, Aida, Otello, and Falstaff.The plot is really second to the music, and I don't mean the standard background fare. Substantial operatic performance clips and background music of Verdi's operas wash over you as you watch. Verdi's musical education began at an early age, although it is not known exactly when he began formal study. It is known that he was captivated by music and that his parents early on decided to give him an instrument of his own, a little spinet piano. Verdi was born to a poor family in a tiny Italian village. He began studying music in a nearby town Busseto, where he was taken into the home of a wealthy patron who later also supported his education in Milan. When he completed his studies, he became municipal music director in Busseto and married his patron's daughter; three years later he returned to Milan with the score of his first opera, Oberto. Oberto was produced at La Scala and had a modest success which brought Verdi a contract for more operas. Then disaster struck. Verdi's wife and their two children died within a very short time. Verdi managed to complete his next opera, but it was a failure and in despair he persuaded himself that there was no consolation in his art and vowed to never compose again.A few years later the film shows when Verdi composed Rigoletto and La Traviata. Although the public loved them, critics were often scandalized by their subject matter. They seemed to condone rape, suicide, and free love. But Verdi was fiercely independent and himself lived openly with his second wife for ten years before marrying her. Verdi composed not for the musical elite but for a mass public whose main entertainment was opera. He wanted subjects that were as Verdi said ""original, interesting and passionate; passions about all!""  Almost all his mature works are serious and end unhappily; they move quickly and involve extremes of hatred, love, jealousy, and fear and his powerful music underlines the dramatic situations.By the end of the film, opera lovers will have felt as if they had just attended a ""highlights"" concert combined with a sometimes somber treatment of the composer's semi tragic life. Those who aren't so familiar with opera will come away with a better sense of the music. If there's one surprise, it's that apart from the performance clips there's very little in the way of dramatic score. Most of the scenes that drive the plot are presented in silence, although music is used for transitions and to heighten emotional moments. People in this day and age aren't exactly known for being opera lovers, on the whole. They generally get their arias from tv commercials and movies. Ask someone to hum a few bars of Verdi's ""Libiamo ne lieti calici"" and you'll get a blank stare or a laugh. Play a few bars for them, and many of them will beam, ""Hey, I've heard that from a commercial on television.""

At the time, I enjoyed the series and shared the VHS tapes with friends because the series was actually quite well done.  I hadn't realized that the DVDs from Kultur were less than full copies of the original broadcasts.  I will not miss Burt Lancaster standing in Verdi's former home as I always questioned why he was selected for that task since he brought nothing of value to the series, but when I watched parts of the DVDs last night, I could barely force myself to stay awake.  Only then did I read the other comments here and realize what had happened.  I am not suffering from memory loss but Kultur did a wretched job producing this set.What Kultur could not damage was wonderful costuming and a few memorable moments, such as Verdi showing a tenor how to die in the last act of Otello.  I felt the DVDs focused on banalties, endless speculation about the relationship Verdi may or may not have had with Teresa Stoltz, incoherent handling of the Mariani issue . . . all in all, the original series suffered horribly from third rate editorial decisions.

778679,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B0000DI86N,Kathy-W,"[1, 1]","This is indeed, as most other reviewers boast, a near-epic miniseries. I can't imagine how abridged the storyline would feel if Kultur had released this DVD set in its original abridged-for-TV version...this, at least, is a saving grace to this product.Some people will complain about the lengthiness of this set, but I wouldn't have it one minute shorter! This story not only discusses Verdi's biography (and in much more detail and depth than any other video I know of), but it tries to talk about some of the actual influences on Verdi as both a man and a composer. These influences were sometimes crippling to his music (the death of his first wife, Margherita) and sometimes sheer blessings (his long and mostly joyous relationship with the singer Giuseppina Strepponi).Some viewers will be disappointed with the fact that this series does NOT talk all about Verdi's operas all the time, but where on the packaging does it actually claim to be merely a dissection of his operas? I think it would be a sweeping assumption to think that all Verdi ever did in his life was sit behind a desk and scribble music down (not to say that composing wasn't an enormous part of his life and surely his biggest achievement). As the series goes on, be assured that there are plenty of musical examples of his operas and plenty of scenes about performances and rehearsals.Be aware that there is some hoaky English dubbing going on - there are times when the words you hear only barely match the lip movements of the on-screen actors. Yet both the voice acting and the on-screen acting are generally competent and enthusiastic, so I'm not sure how much I mind. Better to have an accurate and heartfelt translation than a stilted one!This series is a mixture of documentary and movie drama. For a topic like a musician, this is as good a method as any of presenting a composer's life. In addition to the acted scenes, there is a narrator who explains obscure cultural facets or historical/political tidbits. The narrator's script is a bit overbearing sometimes, but at least they picked someone with a tolerable speaking voice to do it.Now for the bad: like many reviewers complain, both the picture and sound quality are fairly mediocre. There are actually spots where you can see the source tapes have tracking problems, which makes me very much doubt that this DVD transfer was made using the painstaking but worthwhile process of individual frame-by-frame photographic scanning as is more common with DVDs these days. Having said that, the picture quality is viewable in general. The sound is listenable, but has many apparently mono recordings because the sound frequently ""clips"" when a singer goes forte (or when an actor screams loudly). They are mostly very excellent musical examples from excellent singers, so this is a shame. Curiously, the aforementioned narrator has much better sound quality and seems like it is 10-15 years younger than the film itself.It still gets 4 stars from me, because technical problems aside, this is mostly a downright fun and impassioned miniseries. My attention never once wavered during the approximately 13 hours of running time. This set should be near the top of must-watch video biographies for any serious musician, singer, or music trivia buff.",4,A sprawling gem diminished by poor video quality,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,3283,"['indeed', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'boast', 'near-epic', 'miniseries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'abridged', 'storyline', 'would', 'feel', 'Kultur', 'had', 'released', 'DVD', 'set', 'original', 'abridged-for-TV', 'version', 'least', 'saving', 'grace', 'product.Some', 'people', 'will', 'complain', 'lengthiness', 'set', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'minute', 'shorter', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'Verdi', 'biography', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'depth', 'other', 'video', 'know', 'talk', 'actual', 'influences', 'Verdi', 'man', 'composer', 'influences', 'were', 'sometimes', 'crippling', 'music', 'death', 'first', 'wife', 'Margherita', 'sometimes', 'sheer', 'blessings', 'long', 'mostly', 'joyous', 'relationship', 'singer', 'Giuseppina', 'Strepponi', '.Some', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'series', 'NOT', 'talk', 'Verdi', 'time', 'where', 'packaging', 'actually', 'be', 'merely', 'dissection', 'operas', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'sweeping', 'assumption', 'think', 'Verdi', 'ever', 'did', 'life', 'was', 'sit', 'desk', 'scribble', 'music', 'down', 'not', 'say', 'composing', 'was', ""n't"", 'enormous', 'part', 'life', 'surely', 'biggest', 'achievement', 'series', 'be', 'assured', 'are', 'plenty', 'musical', 'examples', 'operas', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'performances', 'rehearsals.Be', 'aware', 'hoaky', 'English', 'dubbing', 'going', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'words', 'hear', 'only', 'barely', 'match', 'lip', 'movements', 'on-screen', 'actors', 'voice', 'acting', 'on-screen', 'acting', 'are', 'generally', 'competent', 'enthusiastic', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'mind', 'Better', 'have', 'accurate', 'heartfelt', 'translation', 'stilted', 'one', 'series', 'mixture', 'documentary', 'movie', 'drama', 'topic', 'musician', 'as', 'good', 'method', 'presenting', 'composer', 'life', 'addition', 'acted', 'scenes', 'narrator', 'who', 'obscure', 'cultural', 'facets', 'historical/political', 'tidbits', 'narrator', 'script', 'bit', 'overbearing', 'sometimes', 'least', 'picked', 'someone', 'tolerable', 'speaking', 'voice', 'do', 'it.Now', 'bad', 'many', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'fairly', 'mediocre', 'are', 'actually', 'spots', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'source', 'tapes', 'have', 'tracking', 'problems', 'very', 'much', 'doubt', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'made', 'using', 'painstaking', 'worthwhile', 'process', 'individual', 'frame-by-frame', 'photographic', 'scanning', 'more', 'common', 'DVDs', 'days', 'Having', 'said', 'picture', 'quality', 'viewable', 'general', 'sound', 'listenable', 'many', 'apparently', 'mono', 'recordings', 'sound', 'frequently', 'clips', 'when', 'singer', 'forte', 'when', 'actor', 'screams', 'loudly', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'excellent', 'musical', 'examples', 'excellent', 'singers', 'shame', 'Curiously', 'aforementioned', 'narrator', 'much', 'better', 'sound', 'quality', '10-15', 'years', 'younger', 'film', 'itself.It', 'still', '4', 'stars', 'technical', 'problems', 'aside', 'mostly', 'downright', 'fun', 'impassioned', 'miniseries', 'attention', 'never', 'once', 'wavered', 'approximately', '13', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'top', 'must-watch', 'video', 'biographies', 'serious', 'musician', 'singer', 'music', 'trivia', 'buff']",N/A

Especially noticable is his pronunciation of 'verdi' to sound like 'birdie'.  Also no dirty linen was brought out, especially about Strepponi and her abandoning her children at birth as unknowns, and never making any effort to ever see or contact them at anytime afterwards.  The film also never raises the question as to why Giuseppe and Giuseppina produced no children of their own.Ok, it's not the ideal film that I would make.

Verdi was far from being the racist and bigot as other nationalists of his time as, for example, Wagner.This production is really amazing.

778683,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B0000DI86N,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[26, 26]","+++++This mini-series dubbed in English on DVD is a dramatized biography of one of the great opera composers, Giuseppe Verdi (1813 to 1901).  The narrated biographical events are played out against the background of Italy's struggle for unity and independence, a cause to which Verdi (Ron Pickup) dedicated his art.There is also romance in this movie as Verdi meets the significant women in his life: Margheritta (Daria Nicolodi), Giuseppina (Italian ballerina Carla Fracci), and Teresa (Eva Christian).  All three along with an older Verdi are shown on the DVD's container cover.The music in this movie is fantastic.  It has recordings of leading operatic voices such as Luciano Pavarotti, Maria Callas, and Renata Tebaldi.  The movie is stunningly photographed and includes actual highlights of many of Verdi's operas such as Nabucco (Nebuchadneezzar, King of Babylon, 1842), I Lombardi, Ernani, Rigoletto, La Traviata (The Lost One), Un Ballo in Maschera (A Masked Ball), Aida, Otello (his greatest lyric tragedy) and Falstaff (1893, his last opera).Each part of this movie has a brief introduction given by a female host.  Here is her introduction for the entire series:""This is a seven-part dramatization of the life of the world's most important and beloved operatic composers.  For the opera fans in the audience, we hope it will enhance your enjoyment...but you don't have to be a devoted opera buff to enjoy this exceptional docudrama.  Some seven million dollars and two years time went into the making of [this mini-series].  It was filmed on location in Italy, France, England, and the Soviet Union.  Great care was taken to ensure the accuracy of historical events, settings, and costuming as you will see.  The result is an intriguing portrait of a man, a country, and the events that shaped their destinies.  The series is a compelling human drama and a tribute to a man that gave us more than twenty-five operas.""Ron Pickup as Verdi gives, I feel, an exceptional performance.  As well, I feel that the male English narrator (who is not given credit) also does a good job.  (Note that in this version, Burt Lancaster is not the narrator.)The sound quality of this DVD is very good.  However, occasionally there are split second disturbances in picture quality.  Because I was so absorbed in the story, I did not find these distracting.  I think its better to own this DVD than to own the video cassette of this mini-series.Finally, this mini-series focuses on Verdi's operas giving the impression he composed only operas.  However, this is not true!  He also composed beautiful vocal and chamber music.In conclusion, this is a spectacular mini-series/movie.  Be sure to see it so as to learn more about the man who said, ""It is better to invent reality than to copy it.""(1982 or 1983 or 1984; 4 discs; 10 hr, 30 min; 7 parts; first 6 parts about 90 min each, last part 120 min; made for TV; full screen)+++++",5,A Celebration of a Musical Genius!!!,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,2923,"['+++++This', 'mini-series', 'dubbed', 'English', 'DVD', 'dramatized', 'biography', 'one', 'great', 'opera', 'composers', 'Giuseppe', 'Verdi', '1813', '1901', 'narrated', 'biographical', 'events', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'background', 'Italy', 'struggle', 'unity', 'independence', 'cause', 'Verdi', 'Ron', 'Pickup', 'dedicated', 'art.There', 'also', 'romance', 'movie', 'Verdi', 'significant', 'women', 'life', 'Margheritta', 'Daria', 'Nicolodi', 'Giuseppina', 'Italian', 'ballerina', 'Carla', 'Fracci', 'Teresa', 'Eva', 'Christian', 'three', 'older', 'Verdi', 'are', 'shown', 'DVD', 'container', 'cover.The', 'music', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'recordings', 'leading', 'operatic', 'voices', 'such', 'Luciano', 'Pavarotti', 'Maria', 'Callas', 'Renata', 'Tebaldi', 'movie', 'stunningly', 'photographed', 'actual', 'highlights', 'many', 'Verdi', 'operas', 'such', 'Nabucco', 'Nebuchadneezzar', 'King', 'Babylon', '1842', 'Lombardi', 'Ernani', 'Rigoletto', 'La', 'Traviata', 'Lost', 'One', 'Un', 'Ballo', 'Maschera', 'A', 'Masked', 'Ball', 'Aida', 'Otello', 'greatest', 'lyric', 'tragedy', 'Falstaff', '1893', 'last', 'opera', '.Each', 'part', 'movie', 'brief', 'introduction', 'given', 'female', 'host', 'Here', 'introduction', 'entire', 'series', 'seven-part', 'dramatization', 'life', 'world', 'most', 'important', 'beloved', 'operatic', 'composers', 'opera', 'fans', 'audience', 'hope', 'will', 'enhance', 'enjoyment', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'devoted', 'opera', 'buff', 'enjoy', 'exceptional', 'docudrama', 'seven', 'million', 'dollars', 'two', 'years', 'time', 'went', 'making', '[', 'mini-series', ']', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Italy', 'France', 'England', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Great', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'ensure', 'accuracy', 'historical', 'events', 'settings', 'costuming', 'will', 'see', 'result', 'intriguing', 'portrait', 'man', 'country', 'events', 'shaped', 'destinies', 'series', 'compelling', 'human', 'drama', 'tribute', 'man', 'gave', 'more', 'twenty-five', 'operas', 'Ron', 'Pickup', 'Verdi', 'feel', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'As', 'well', 'feel', 'male', 'English', 'narrator', 'who', 'not', 'given', 'credit', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'Note', 'version', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'not', 'narrator', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'occasionally', 'are', 'split', 'second', 'disturbances', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'so', 'absorbed', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'distracting', 'think', 'better', 'own', 'DVD', 'own', 'video', 'cassette', 'mini-series.Finally', 'mini-series', 'focuses', 'Verdi', 'operas', 'giving', 'impression', 'composed', 'only', 'operas', 'However', 'not', 'true', 'also', 'composed', 'beautiful', 'vocal', 'chamber', 'music.In', 'conclusion', 'spectacular', 'mini-series/movie', 'Be', 'sure', 'see', 'so', 'learn', 'more', 'man', 'who', 'said', 'better', 'invent', 'reality', 'copy', '1982', '1983', '1984', '4', 'discs', '10', 'hr', '30', 'min', '7', 'parts', 'first', '6', 'parts', '90', 'min', 'last', 'part', '120', 'min', 'made', 'TV', 'full', 'screen', '+++++']",N/A

What fails us now is Kultur's amateurish transfer. First of all, viewers can't skip past Robert Peter's introductions (which could easily have been omitted but at least she, unlike Burt Lancaster on PBS, could pronounce &quot;Verdi&quot;). Second, the transfer is from a flawed video tape. Tracking problems occur occasionally which they wouldn't had Kultur bothered to go back to the originals. How cheap!! Now watch them remaster it and us who have it forced to decide whether to get a whole new set of something that should have been done RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!!",4,fine accomplishment but poor transfer,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,693,"['original', 'presentation', 'quot', 'Life', 'Verdi', 'quot', 'was', 'well-conceived', 'well-executed', 'treat', 'counts', 'What', 'now', 'Kultur', 'amateurish', 'transfer', 'First', 'viewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'past', 'Robert', 'Peter', 'introductions', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'least', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'PBS', 'could', 'pronounce', 'quot', 'Verdi', 'quot', 'Second', 'transfer', 'flawed', 'video', 'tape', 'Tracking', 'problems', 'occur', 'occasionally', 'would', ""n't"", 'had', 'Kultur', 'bothered', 'go', 'back', 'originals', 'How', 'cheap', 'Now', 'watch', 'remaster', 'who', 'have', 'forced', 'decide', 'get', 'whole', 'new', 'set', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'RIGHT', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'TIME']",N/A
