I thought that my children would be thrilled to see one of the movies I grew up with, HA!  They got up and left the room to go play.  The animation was awful; it's nothing like the bright cute colors on the DVD case.  The stupid songs are now stuck in my head.  All I can say it thank God for Disney.  They never had bad stuff like this.  I didn't even want to leave a star.  It's BIG FAT 0 in my book, I gave it away to the Library.",1,Not worth the money,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,527,"['saw', 'movie', 'child', 'loved', 'then', 'again', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'water', 'adventure', 'thought', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'thrilled', 'see', 'one', 'movies', 'grew', 'up', 'HA', 'got', 'up', 'left', 'room', 'go', 'play', 'animation', 'was', 'awful', 'nothing', 'bright', 'cute', 'colors', 'DVD', 'case', 'stupid', 'songs', 'are', 'now', 'stuck', 'head', 'can', 'say', 'thank', 'God', 'Disney', 'never', 'had', 'bad', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'leave', 'star', 'BIG', 'FAT', '0', 'book', 'gave', 'away', 'Library']",N/A

I used to watch it nonstop when I was a kid, and missed it daily when my only video cassete copy of it got damaged, and they stopped showing it on tv along with a lot of other animated favorites of mine. I'm glad that SOMEBODY finally released it again on DVD, so I can watch it again for old times sake, and show my kids and younger cousins what their generation missed. :DNow if only they'd release classic animated movies like Mouse and Child, Raggedy Ann and Andy, Pinochio and the Emperor of the Night, etc. again....",5,Classic Kids Movie Makes a Comeback!,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,601,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'YEARS', 'finally', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'Water', 'Babies', 'used', 'watch', 'nonstop', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'missed', 'daily', 'when', 'only', 'video', 'cassete', 'copy', 'got', 'damaged', 'stopped', 'showing', 'tv', 'lot', 'other', 'animated', 'favorites', 'mine', ""'m"", 'glad', 'SOMEBODY', 'finally', 'released', 'again', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'old', 'times', 'sake', 'show', 'kids', 'younger', 'cousins', 'what', 'generation', 'missed', 'DNow', 'only', ""'d"", 'release', 'classic', 'animated', 'movies', 'Mouse', 'Child', 'Raggedy', 'Ann', 'Andy', 'Pinochio', 'Emperor', 'Night', 'etc', 'again']",N/A

SUDDENLY an animation pops up worse than anything Filmmations ever released! Without looking, I counted at least 4 ""dissapearing"" objects throughout (due to faulty proof work) not to mention dialogue out of synch, horrible design and many more things too numerous to mention.

I remembered it was from some old movie that was part live-action and part animation. After years of searching, I've found it, and so have you.Please note- this movie is bad. Yes, I know you thought it was awesome as a kid, but kids are easily impressed, especially back in '79 when I first saw this.This movie is wacked. It's hard to understand what most people are saying since the English/Welsh accent is very strong. The plot is pretty convoluted - many things go unexplained and make very little sense.

This 1978 feature is a mix of live-action musical and animation, focusing on the adventures of a chimney sweep, Tom who is blamed for a crime he is innocent of. The time period is 1850s England, and although a rich girl, Ellie knows he is innocent, she is unable to help Tom clear his name. Circumstances lead Tom to fall into Dead Man's Pool, and he is assumed to be dead. However, Tom enters a remarkable and strange new world, where the Water Babies live. The antagonists here are an eel and a shark, creatures that terrorize the water babies. Tom meets the all powerful Cracken and pleads for help to prove his innocence. This request comes at a price, but will it be too high for Tom? James Mason lends his voice to this feature. The film may be a bit dated, but the magic of the story continues to beguile young viewers, and my daughter found it interesting and fun to watch.",4,Wonderful family-friendly animated feature,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,992,"['remember', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'back', '80s', 'loved', 'blend', 'fantasy', 'adventure', '1978', 'feature', 'mix', 'live-action', 'musical', 'animation', 'focusing', 'adventures', 'chimney', 'sweep', 'Tom', 'who', 'blamed', 'crime', 'innocent', 'time', 'period', '1850s', 'England', 'rich', 'girl', 'Ellie', 'innocent', 'unable', 'help', 'Tom', 'clear', 'name', 'Circumstances', 'lead', 'Tom', 'fall', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Pool', 'assumed', 'be', 'dead', 'However', 'Tom', 'remarkable', 'strange', 'new', 'world', 'where', 'Water', 'Babies', 'live', 'antagonists', 'here', 'are', 'eel', 'shark', 'terrorize', 'water', 'babies', 'Tom', 'powerful', 'Cracken', 'pleads', 'help', 'prove', 'innocence', 'request', 'price', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'high', 'Tom', 'James', 'Mason', 'voice', 'feature', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'dated', 'magic', 'story', 'beguile', 'young', 'viewers', 'daughter', 'found', 'interesting', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A
