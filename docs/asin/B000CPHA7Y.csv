The story grabs your attention fom the beginning and takes you on a sweet ride. In a world of drunken and foul mouthed teens in other filmfare it is a relief to see a movie and story that unfolds with such grace and inner beauty. As a filmmaker myself I was taken by Sara's beauty since she reminds me of an actress that starred in one of my own films. Congratulations to the director and cast of this wonderful film.

959851,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000CPHA7Y,Artist & Author,"[23, 24]","I try to include as many spiritual movies in my reviews that I can, as long as they are consistent with traditional Christian values.  This movie goes right to the top of the list of Spiritual movies; it is how I think a Christian movie should be made.  First, it is an exciting and fascinating story in itself; a 12-year-old boy and girl pledge their love for each other, but are separated.  Will they forget their promises to each other, like most kids, or somehow find their way back to each other.In this movie, we have an unchurched girl, Sarah, who somehow senses the Presence of God in her life.  She, like her hero Joan of Arc, clearly wants to live only in ways that are pleasing to God.  When she feels she has sinned, knowing of Confession in the Catholic Church, she turns to the local priest.  I should interject here that this priest is how a priest should be, and, indeed, he is like most all the priests I've met.  (Unlike so much media negative image of Catholic priests.)  The way he handles Sarah serves to strengthen her faith.  But, all this spiritual element is done so subtly, so naturally and without a hint of preaching, that it really is Christianity by example.  I should add that Sarah is not a confirmed Catholic, so Protestants can appreciate the story as much as anyone would.I don't dare say anything more lest I give away the story, which is a powerful story of simple faith and trust in God.  All I have to say is that I have watched thousands of movies, many with spiritual elements, and this is by far the top in general production quality, caliber of acting, and in its story.  I have to thank Mel Gibson for showing that there is a real thirst for top-quality Christian movies.  If you watch only one spiritual movie this year, make it this one.",5,How a Christian Movie Should Be Made,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,1783,"['try', 'include', 'many', 'spiritual', 'movies', 'reviews', 'can', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'consistent', 'traditional', 'Christian', 'values', 'movie', 'right', 'top', 'list', 'Spiritual', 'movies', 'how', 'think', 'Christian', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'First', 'exciting', 'fascinating', 'story', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'girl', 'pledge', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'separated', 'Will', 'forget', 'promises', 'other', 'most', 'kids', 'somehow', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'other.In', 'movie', 'have', 'unchurched', 'girl', 'Sarah', 'who', 'somehow', 'Presence', 'God', 'life', 'hero', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'clearly', 'live', 'only', 'ways', 'are', 'pleasing', 'God', 'When', 'sinned', 'knowing', 'Confession', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'local', 'priest', 'should', 'interject', 'here', 'priest', 'how', 'priest', 'should', 'be', 'indeed', 'most', 'priests', ""'ve"", 'met', 'so', 'much', 'media', 'negative', 'image', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'way', 'Sarah', 'strengthen', 'faith', 'spiritual', 'element', 'done', 'so', 'subtly', 'naturally', 'hint', 'preaching', 'really', 'Christianity', 'example', 'should', 'add', 'Sarah', 'not', 'confirmed', 'Catholic', 'Protestants', 'can', 'appreciate', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'would.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'lest', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'powerful', 'story', 'simple', 'faith', 'trust', 'God', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'watched', 'thousands', 'movies', 'many', 'spiritual', 'elements', 'far', 'top', 'general', 'production', 'quality', 'caliber', 'acting', 'story', 'have', 'thank', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'showing', 'real', 'thirst', 'top-quality', 'Christian', 'movies', 'watch', 'only', 'one', 'spiritual', 'movie', 'year', 'make', 'one']",Echoes of Innocence

I thought the acting was very good and the story was one that unfolded at a nice pace. I found it to be one that not only spoke to a relevant issue for today's teens, but also presented a beautiful allegory to those of us who are Christians. Frankly, I have watched it several times, and I enjoy it more with each viewing. It certainly is a very thought-provoking film and one that I would recommend to others.",4,Echoes Of Innocence,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,843,"['Echoes', 'InnocenceThis', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'require', 'know', 'who', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'so', 'did', 'have', 'provide', 'background', 'info', 'teenaged', 'grandchildren', 'who', 'watched', 'found', 'storyline', 'action', 'bit', 'as', 'intriguing', 'did.On', 'one', 'hand', 'did', 'have', 'explain', 'symbolism', 'do', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'need', 'turn', 'movies', 'teachable', 'moments', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'unfolded', 'nice', 'pace', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'spoke', 'relevant', 'issue', 'today', 'teens', 'also', 'presented', 'beautiful', 'allegory', 'who', 'are', 'Christians', 'Frankly', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'enjoy', 'more', 'viewing', 'certainly', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'others']",Echoes of Innocence

959856,A1ZSWL641H5018,B000CPHA7Y,"Marie44 ""marie44""","[5, 5]","This film has a very intense, mysterious plot with a lot of suspense. I liked it, but I'm not sure how to describe it. Sarah and Christopher pledge their love to each other as young teenagers, then Christopher is gone. Sarah, whose hero is Joan of Arc and has visions, wants to remain true to the promise she and Christopher made to one another.  Sarah has a very disturbed mother and she tries hard not to be like her in any way, and seeks spiritual guidance from a priest even though she is not Catholic. There are evil influences and distractions and temptations along the way. This film almost seemed allegorical with Sarah as the Church and Christopher as the Christ in how she attempts to stay faithful even when she has no sign Christopher will ever return. The ending is a surprise with scenes that can easily be interpreted with double meanings. On the negative side, some scenes don't flow well, such as the group of teenagers talking about taking a purity pledge and then Sarah and another girl sitting in a hall--it seems something is missing in between. And there is a very violent series of events at night, but it's so dark in the scenes it's difficult to tell what is happening. It's also never quite clear why the grandmother sits and stares and has no reactions to Sarah talking to her. Other than those minor flaws, it is a good movie and the acting is very well done. I especially liked the acting of Sarah in the school play. All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who would like to see an unusual film with strong Christian messages.",4,Not the usual Christian film fare,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,1566,"['film', 'very', 'intense', 'mysterious', 'plot', 'lot', 'suspense', 'liked', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'describe', 'Sarah', 'Christopher', 'pledge', 'love', 'other', 'young', 'teenagers', 'then', 'Christopher', 'gone', 'Sarah', 'hero', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'visions', 'remain', 'true', 'promise', 'Christopher', 'made', 'one', 'Sarah', 'very', 'disturbed', 'mother', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'way', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'priest', 'even', 'not', 'Catholic', 'are', 'evil', 'influences', 'distractions', 'temptations', 'way', 'film', 'almost', 'seemed', 'allegorical', 'Sarah', 'Church', 'Christopher', 'Christ', 'how', 'stay', 'faithful', 'even', 'when', 'sign', 'Christopher', 'will', 'ever', 'return', 'ending', 'surprise', 'scenes', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'interpreted', 'double', 'meanings', 'negative', 'side', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'well', 'such', 'group', 'teenagers', 'talking', 'taking', 'purity', 'pledge', 'then', 'Sarah', 'girl', 'sitting', 'hall', 'something', 'missing', 'very', 'violent', 'series', 'events', 'night', 'so', 'dark', 'scenes', 'difficult', 'tell', 'what', 'happening', 'also', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'why', 'grandmother', 'sits', 'stares', 'reactions', 'Sarah', 'talking', 'Other', 'minor', 'flaws', 'good', 'movie', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'liked', 'acting', 'Sarah', 'school', 'play', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'unusual', 'film', 'strong', 'Christian', 'messages']",Echoes of Innocence
