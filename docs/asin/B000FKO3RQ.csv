I just finished watching the entire thing and am going; awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.  Amazing.  If you can dream up the perfect story that combines young, old, technology, religion, good, bad and put it together; Broken Saints will be 1000 times better than anything you could come up with.It is part Cyberpunk, part religious tale, part storytelling.  Truly, truly amazed.In terms of Anime or other things that are considered different or strange;Broken Saints is better than Akira, probably better than some of the Ghost in the Shell series.  It doesn't really compare to any hollywood stories, but it beats the story of Lord of the Rings.Good job.  I was lucky that was able to experience this.Anybody who gives this a bad review.  They probably didn't watch most it, have really low IQ or flat out crazy.

991899,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FKO3RQ,"Cloud ""...""","[7, 10]","I don't even know how I first heard of this. It was essentially something I just heard about but never got much detail but eventually the buzz started and I just had to find out what everyone was talking about. The series, basically done single-handedly by 3 people, ended up being an internet hit and the series ran for the better part of 2 years. Afterwards they got more funding and an expanded team to put it onto DVD. With improved animation and sound as well as voice acting, the set is a fascinating look at a project that you find easy to admire but it's hard to love since it does a couple of things wrong.Played out like an animated graphic novel, the story centers around 4 people: Raimi, a computer programmer living in America; Shandala, an orphan being raised on an island in the South Pacific; Kamimura, a Monk in Japan and Oran, a Middle-Eastern man. Each one gets a vision of an upcoming apocalypse and its this that eventually gets them together and try to figure out what it means and if they can maybe stop it. The story is separated into roughly 24 chapters which get progressively longer and in some have more than one part.One thing while watching the series is just how cool it felt: seeing animated characters actually move in a world (albeit with limited animation) felt for once like experiencing what I had to do in my mind when I read the Sandman, Fables or even comic books like Superman and the X-Men. The animation isn't particularly attention grabbing since it was never meant to but it sure does look...neat. Character designs and scenes look nice and small animated effects happen, some as small as a character smoking to a bit more ambitious stuff like rays, weird freaky imagery and the like. It's also a bit odd since the series was originally designed on the computer where it's easy to maybe web surf in the meantime while an episode is playing but on DVD, the series looks kind of small and low-budget looking rather than immensely detailed.While the animation is solid and the story is incredibly intriguing, the same can not be said for the writing. Granted, it's better worded than anything I've written but it's more abstract and pretentious and it just seems too...""dictionary""-esque rather than it being natural. Lines such as ""emperors and quiet kings lay sun's egg and fry the darkness"" or ""oily teeth scrape the fetal glass of the east"" don't bring about reactions of its profundity and its depth, it's more a case of: ""....what the **** does that even mean anyway?"" It makes the beginning of the show incredibly slow since characters talk in looong soliloquies in quasi-poetic language and it just comes across as being a bothersome.Some DVD sets are content to have commentaries on 2-3 episodes and a couple featurettes. Not so with here where anything and everything seems compiled to offer a glimpse into the making. We get featurettes on the animation production, voice acting and sound, a panel discussion, a lecture, trip to Sundance and many more, and I'm not counting audio commentary on every episode. They're spread out over the discs rather than one disc(usually the last) being packed. The one thing I should mention: sometimes the buttons wouldn't register a button press such as wanting to play an episode, instead acting like I wanted to go to the next selection while the other DVD player in the house worked. Just as a word of caution.Also must mention the packaging: The main disc storage is similar to what you can find in the old Smallville sets with the book format rather than the opening flaps but it's what holds them that's different. A plastic cover fits the whole thing and on the corners is cardboard cutouts of the characters attached that swing back and forth. It's a neat idea for sure but it almost seems kind of flimsy and almost like you have to be super careful or you'll rip one and make the whole thing look ugly. Kudos for trying something new but like the Simpsons head packaging, a new idea does not a good idea make.Is is a worthwhile story to get into? Absolutely, not only for the concept itself and the story but just the fun of it. If you can get past the thicker than thick writing or its limited animated presentation, you'll find a worthwhile series to get into but doesn't have that all around ""masterpiece"", more like a really cool thing.",4,Engrossing but flawed,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,4339,"['do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'essentially', 'something', 'just', 'heard', 'never', 'got', 'much', 'detail', 'eventually', 'buzz', 'started', 'just', 'had', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'everyone', 'was', 'talking', 'series', 'basically', 'done', 'single-handedly', '3', 'people', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'internet', 'hit', 'series', 'ran', 'better', 'part', '2', 'years', 'got', 'more', 'funding', 'expanded', 'team', 'put', 'DVD', 'improved', 'animation', 'sound', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'acting', 'set', 'fascinating', 'look', 'project', 'find', 'easy', 'admire', 'hard', 'love', 'couple', 'things', 'wrong.Played', 'out', 'animated', 'graphic', 'novel', 'story', 'centers', '4', 'people', 'Raimi', 'computer', 'programmer', 'living', 'America', 'Shandala', 'orphan', 'being', 'raised', 'island', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Kamimura', 'Monk', 'Japan', 'Oran', 'Middle-Eastern', 'man', 'one', 'vision', 'upcoming', 'apocalypse', 'eventually', 'together', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'can', 'maybe', 'stop', 'story', 'separated', 'roughly', '24', 'chapters', 'get', 'progressively', 'longer', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'part.One', 'thing', 'watching', 'series', 'just', 'how', 'cool', 'felt', 'seeing', 'animated', 'characters', 'actually', 'move', 'world', 'limited', 'animation', 'felt', 'once', 'experiencing', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'mind', 'when', 'read', 'Sandman', 'Fables', 'even', 'comic', 'books', 'Superman', 'X-Men', 'animation', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'sure', 'look', 'neat', 'Character', 'designs', 'scenes', 'look', 'nice', 'small', 'animated', 'effects', 'happen', 'as', 'small', 'character', 'smoking', 'bit', 'more', 'ambitious', 'stuff', 'rays', 'weird', 'freaky', 'imagery', 'like', 'also', 'bit', 'odd', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'designed', 'computer', 'where', 'easy', 'maybe', 'web', 'surf', 'meantime', 'episode', 'playing', 'DVD', 'series', 'kind', 'small', 'low-budget', 'looking', 'rather', 'immensely', 'animation', 'solid', 'story', 'incredibly', 'intriguing', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'writing', 'Granted', 'better', 'worded', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'written', 'more', 'abstract', 'pretentious', 'just', 'too', 'dictionary', '-esque', 'rather', 'being', 'natural', 'Lines', 'such', 'emperors', 'quiet', 'kings', 'lay', 'sun', 'egg', 'fry', 'darkness', 'oily', 'scrape', 'fetal', 'glass', 'east', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'about', 'reactions', 'profundity', 'depth', 'more', 'case', '.what', '****', 'even', 'mean', 'anyway', 'beginning', 'show', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'characters', 'talk', 'looong', 'soliloquies', 'quasi-poetic', 'language', 'just', 'across', 'being', 'bothersome.Some', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'content', 'have', 'commentaries', '2-3', 'episodes', 'couple', 'featurettes', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'where', 'anything', 'everything', 'compiled', 'offer', 'glimpse', 'making', 'get', 'featurettes', 'animation', 'production', 'voice', 'acting', 'sound', 'panel', 'discussion', 'lecture', 'trip', 'Sundance', 'many', 'more', ""'m"", 'not', 'counting', 'audio', 'commentary', 'episode', ""'re"", 'spread', 'out', 'discs', 'rather', 'one', 'disc', 'usually', 'last', 'being', 'packed', 'one', 'thing', 'should', 'mention', 'sometimes', 'buttons', 'would', ""n't"", 'register', 'button', 'press', 'such', 'wanting', 'play', 'episode', 'instead', 'acting', 'wanted', 'go', 'next', 'selection', 'other', 'DVD', 'player', 'house', 'worked', 'Just', 'word', 'caution.Also', 'must', 'mention', 'packaging', 'main', 'disc', 'storage', 'similar', 'what', 'can', 'find', 'old', 'Smallville', 'book', 'rather', 'opening', 'flaps', 'what', 'different', 'plastic', 'cover', 'whole', 'thing', 'corners', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'characters', 'attached', 'swing', 'back', 'forth', 'neat', 'idea', 'sure', 'almost', 'kind', 'flimsy', 'almost', 'have', 'be', 'super', 'careful', ""'ll"", 'rip', 'one', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'look', 'ugly', 'Kudos', 'trying', 'something', 'new', 'Simpsons', 'head', 'packaging', 'new', 'idea', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'make.Is', 'worthwhile', 'story', 'get', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'only', 'concept', 'story', 'just', 'fun', 'can', 'get', 'thicker', 'thick', 'writing', 'limited', 'animated', 'presentation', ""'ll"", 'find', 'worthwhile', 'series', 'get', ""n't"", 'have', 'masterpiece', 'more', 'really', 'cool', 'thing']",Broken Saints - The Animated Comic Epic

991901,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B000FKO3RQ,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[1, 1]","When I first saw the trailer for this back in college, I knew I had to see it. Sadly, it would take 6 years from seeing the trailer to finally get a copy of it. Now that I have it, I'm not dissappointed.Brooke Burgress calls this ""cinematic literature,"" while it may be so, it's also much more. Looking beyond the flashy animations, complex sound effects, and multilayered storyline, it's a mire of different genres, among them being technothriller, urban punk, philosophical literature, and even conspiracy thriller, along with psychological thriller. Just with the technothriller area and how it has an integral element of computer hacking, it got my attention front-and-center.4 seemingly random people who don't know each other end up getting mixed in to each other's lives when ""random"" occurences force them together to face a very dangerous happening: a well-known telecommunication company is using technology to, in the near future, use its own technology to induce fear into every individual on Earth and use their fear as a means of brainwashing them to accept the head conspirator's view of ""truth,"" which has nothing good included, only fear, death, and extreme hatred. And it's only up to these four strangers to stop it from happening.Over the course of 24 chapters, we see alternating points of view of what's going on, so you don't see only a biased American's view, a naive Fiji native's view, a confused Buddhist's view, nor just a saddened Muslim's view. You see them all, and sometimes they're conflicting, sometimes they get along (tediously), but they have to learn to depend on each other to get through it.Keep in mind, this is not family-friendly viewing at all. Very heavy swearing (especially in the chapter ""Signals""), some mature themes (including sexual jeers and soldiers making crude sexual statements about those they hate), and some rather heavy-handed violence. Not to mention some disturbing images (for anyone that loves animals, one of the later episodes will definitely disturb them deeply). Like I said, not family-friendly.This is truly thought-provoking material, even with occassional comical moments it had.Who knows? Maybe this could inspire some new media entertainment styles in the future.
