We have another Jillian yoga workout DVD, and we expect a hybrid of cardio/strength/stretch with her yoga. That said, it's very effective and a great addition to our rotation.

I hadn't done yoga daily in a couple of years so I wanted to get back into it.For anyone saying they were shocked that this yoga DVD was not relaxing, it's Jillian Michaels... At the end of Workout 1 she says &#34;I WANT you to be uncomfortable!&#34; She wants you to push yourself and she's more concerned about burning calories. She is a weight loss expert after all. So if you're looking for relaxing yoga, don't look here. However, if you want a good workout while becoming more flexible, this is the DVD for you.WARNING: if you're like me and you haven't done yoga in a while and you're not very physically fit, you probably won't finish workout 1 on the first try. Keep at it and eventually you'll get used to it.ALSO, she has a woman behind her that does a modified (easier) version, she does the intermediate, and the other woman does the advanced version. So if Jillian's moves are too hard, you can't really complain because there's easier ones there for you. Also, any DVD called YOGA INFERNO doesn't really give off the &#34;ohm namaste&#34; relaxation vibe.

That's exactly what I was looking for - an athletic, yoga-flavored workout - so I really enjoyed it. That being said, the workout wasn't very difficult in the bootcamp style that I'm used to, mainly because each one is so short, and the hardest moves - whether isometric or dynamic - didn't last long enough to push you to that bittersweet spot of fitness pain. I also wish the workout had more flexibility-incorporating moves; I didn't get that loose and limber feeling like I did after, say, Bob Harper's yoga. This is only a minor complaint though; I'm a bit more flexible than average, so I usually need the really convoluted yoga moves to challenge me on that front. On the other hand, strength moves are my weakness (pun intended), so the multitude of chaturangas that Jillian asks for did push me in this workout.",4,Great athletic yoga,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,912,"['Jillian', 'more', 'yoga-*inspired*', 'workout', 'pure', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'athletic', 'yoga-flavored', 'workout', 'so', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'said', 'workout', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'difficult', 'bootcamp', 'style', ""'m"", 'used', 'mainly', 'one', 'so', 'short', 'hardest', 'moves', 'isometric', 'dynamic', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'enough', 'push', 'bittersweet', 'spot', 'fitness', 'pain', 'also', 'wish', 'workout', 'had', 'more', 'flexibility-incorporating', 'moves', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'loose', 'limber', 'feeling', 'did', 'say', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'yoga', 'only', 'minor', 'complaint', ""'m"", 'bit', 'more', 'flexible', 'average', 'usually', 'need', 'really', 'convoluted', 'yoga', 'moves', 'challenge', 'front', 'other', 'hand', 'strength', 'moves', 'are', 'weakness', 'pun', 'intended', 'multitude', 'chaturangas', 'Jillian', 'asks', 'did', 'push', 'workout']",Jillian Michaels Yoga Inferno

1653352,A3E02KBFI21TY0,B00D2YCLF8,"Angela Risner ""The Sassy Orange""","[17, 33]","****Updated 01/26/2014 to add: For more information on Yoga injuries, which come about from Yoga DVDs like this, go to the Organic Spa Magazine website and search for What's Happened to Yoga? (I can't post the link here as Amazon won't allow links.)****Full disclosure:  I am not a fitness professional.  I do take 3-4 Yoga classes per week and have been doing off and on for a few years now.  I also believe that if you are starting a Yoga practice, it needs to be in the studio with a certified instructor.  Certified, as in has taken at least a 200 hour course, if not more.  Do NOT start a Yoga home practice without attending classes first.  You need a teacher to help you ensure the correct alignment.  Once you have that muscle memory of what a pose feels like when it's done correctly, then you can start a home practice.I'm a naturally happy person - very upbeat and positive.  Thus, it is always surprising to people that if I had to choose one of the trainers from The Biggest Loser as my personal trainer, it would be Jillian.  I like to be pushed and maybe even a bit scared of someone when it comes to working out.  And Jillian fits that bill.However, Yoga is completely different.  Yoga is not meant to be pushy or scary or really loud, though it will allow you to push yourself - mentally, emotionally, and physically.  It's an incredible way to exercise your mind, body, and spirit.  And you will build muscle.I wouldn't choose Jillian for a Yoga instructor.  Her personality just doesn't lend itself to that type of class.Yes, you can play upbeat music for Yoga and still get in the zone.  And there are types of Yoga, such as Ashtanga, that move through the poses quickly, so you elevate your heart rate more as well as give your muscles a workout.  That being said, Yoga is about connecting to the breath, and then connecting the breath to the pose.  But the breath is the most important part of Yoga.My biggest complaints about Jillian's version of Yoga:1.  The breath, or lack thereof.  You need to get your breathing in place before you begin your practice.2.  The modifications.  I understand that you can't demonstrate every modification.  But, in class you have a teacher reminding you that if you have back problems, you shouldn't raise your arms or legs above a certain level.  If you have neck problems, you really shouldn't do handstand or even plow. That wasn't present at all in this DVD.  If some folks try a 3-Legged Downward Dog, they will probably injure themselves and not walk for a week.3.  The constant chatter.  Chatter to tell me where my legs, hands, feet, arms should be aligned in a pose?  Yes.  But beyond that, not so much.4.  Weights.  Ummmm, yeah, we don't use weights in Yoga.  You are lifting and supporting your own body weight, which will build a great deal of muscle on its own. You don't need hand weights.As far as I know, Jillian is not a certified Yoga Instructor.  She should not be putting out any DVDs about Yoga.If you absolutely cannot attend a Yoga class and could only do Yoga at home, go to the Yoga Journal website where they have some downloads and DVDs you can purchase.  Those, at the very least, are led by certified instructors.  Don't just purchase a Yoga DVD because it's from Jillian - it's not really Yoga.Cannot recommend.",1,That's not Yoga - and you could really hurt yourself,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,3299,"['****Updated', '01/26/2014', 'add', 'more', 'information', 'Yoga', 'injuries', 'come', 'Yoga', 'DVDs', 'go', 'Organic', 'Spa', 'Magazine', 'website', 'search', 'What', 'Happened', 'Yoga', 'ca', ""n't"", 'post', 'link', 'here', 'Amazon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'links', '****Full', 'disclosure', 'am', 'not', 'fitness', 'professional', 'do', 'take', '3-4', 'Yoga', 'classes', 'week', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'off', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'also', 'believe', 'are', 'starting', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'be', 'studio', 'certified', 'instructor', 'Certified', 'taken', 'least', '200', 'hour', 'course', 'not', 'more', 'Do', 'NOT', 'start', 'Yoga', 'home', 'practice', 'attending', 'classes', 'first', 'need', 'teacher', 'help', 'ensure', 'correct', 'alignment', 'Once', 'have', 'muscle', 'memory', 'what', 'pose', 'feels', 'when', 'done', 'correctly', 'then', 'can', 'start', 'home', 'practice.I', ""'m"", 'naturally', 'happy', 'person', 'very', 'upbeat', 'positive', 'Thus', 'always', 'surprising', 'people', 'had', 'choose', 'one', 'trainers', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'personal', 'trainer', 'would', 'be', 'Jillian', 'like', 'be', 'pushed', 'maybe', 'even', 'bit', 'scared', 'someone', 'when', 'working', 'out', 'Jillian', 'fits', 'bill.However', 'Yoga', 'completely', 'different', 'Yoga', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'pushy', 'scary', 'really', 'loud', 'will', 'allow', 'push', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'incredible', 'way', 'exercise', 'mind', 'body', 'spirit', 'will', 'build', 'muscle.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'choose', 'Jillian', 'Yoga', 'instructor', 'personality', 'just', ""n't"", 'lend', 'type', 'class.Yes', 'can', 'play', 'upbeat', 'music', 'Yoga', 'still', 'get', 'zone', 'are', 'types', 'Yoga', 'such', 'Ashtanga', 'move', 'poses', 'quickly', 'elevate', 'heart', 'rate', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'muscles', 'workout', 'being', 'said', 'Yoga', 'connecting', 'breath', 'then', 'connecting', 'breath', 'pose', 'breath', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'Yoga.My', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'Jillian', 'version', 'Yoga:1', 'breath', 'lack', 'thereof', 'need', 'get', 'breathing', 'place', 'begin', 'practice.2', 'modifications', 'understand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'demonstrate', 'modification', 'class', 'have', 'teacher', 'reminding', 'have', 'back', 'problems', 'should', ""n't"", 'raise', 'arms', 'legs', 'certain', 'level', 'have', 'neck', 'problems', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'do', 'handstand', 'even', 'plow', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'DVD', 'folks', 'try', '3-Legged', 'Downward', 'Dog', 'will', 'probably', 'injure', 'not', 'walk', 'week.3', 'constant', 'chatter', 'Chatter', 'tell', 'where', 'legs', 'hands', 'feet', 'arms', 'should', 'be', 'aligned', 'pose', 'Yes', 'not', 'so', 'much.4', 'Weights', 'Ummmm', 'yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'weights', 'Yoga', 'are', 'lifting', 'supporting', 'own', 'body', 'weight', 'will', 'build', 'great', 'deal', 'muscle', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hand', 'weights.As', 'far', 'know', 'Jillian', 'not', 'certified', 'Yoga', 'Instructor', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'putting', 'out', 'DVDs', 'Yoga.If', 'absolutely', 'can', 'not', 'attend', 'Yoga', 'class', 'could', 'only', 'do', 'Yoga', 'home', 'go', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'website', 'where', 'have', 'downloads', 'DVDs', 'can', 'purchase', 'very', 'least', 'are', 'led', 'certified', 'instructors', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'purchase', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'Jillian', 'not', 'really', 'Yoga.', 'Can', 'not', 'recommend']",Jillian Michaels Yoga Inferno

I also ordered one as a gift for my friend.,5,I bought 2,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,172,"['was', 'lot', 'harder', 'expected', 'guess', 'think', 'easy', 'bc', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'around', 'was', 'wrong', 'very', 'good', 'dvd', 'also', 'ordered', 'one', 'gift', 'friend']",Jillian Michaels Yoga Inferno
1653354,A3JR4ZUHGBY8T4,B00D2YCLF8,Beck_Ives,"[75, 81]","A word of CAUTION: This is not the yoga you are probably used to if you are unfamiliar with Jillian's take on yoga. Yoga with Jillian is not yoga with anyone else. So be prepared to wonder what on earth she is doing, making you do mountain climbers in yoga. But it is completely, and totally worth it. Just don't expect a nice, relaxing yoga dvd when you order this one.Also, when I realized Jillian and her dancers were on a desert landscape doing yoga in aviators, I thought this was going to be a waste of money. It's a little weird at first. But it is a fantastic workout, so all of that can be overlooked pretty quickly.The only negative thing besides the set that I can say is that she goes through the movements a little fast- even though I am experienced in yoga, this takes some getting used to. Normally she takes time to tell you what each move is and how to get into it and mistakes to avoid, but she really doesn't do that too much in this video. It's okay, once you do the video a few times you get used to it anyway, and then the time she does spend explaining a move feels like a waste of time. So it's not really a huge con to me. Definitely not enough to rate this below 5 stars.THE WORKOUTS:Wow! Workout one is intense. The cardio she combines with this yoga is ACTUALLY cardio. Her previous dvd combined cardio with yoga- sort of. It was just going in and out of yoga poses, which does increase the heart rate to a degree. THIS workout uses actual cardio moves in between yoga sets- like mountain climbers and squat jacks. So my original plan was to do a real cardio workout after I did this one the first time. Well, I didn't end up needing to. By the end of this workout, I was dying. I was soaking wet with sweat and in dire need of hydration. So it was a job well done. I woke up sore the following morning, so my muscles definitely felt it as much as my heart and lungs did. All in all: this is a really good workout.Workout two is also intense, and combines weights with yoga poses. Be prepared- it also has some cardio intervals, too. She recommends using 3 lb weights, which I did. I could probably handle a heavier weight if I so desired, since I am coming off of a summer of P90X and I feel pretty good about my strength abilities right now. HOWEVER, when you are intentional with your moves and use isometric resistance with your weight training, sometimes those 3 lbs are enough. In this case, I felt like they were enough most of the time. I am not trying to bulk up as much as I am trying to tone, so I am less concerned about the heavier weight. But by all means, if you need to use a heavier weight to make yourself feel like you're getting something out of this workout- go ahead. Just know that I think you might be nuts, and you need to be CAREFUL, because you could really hurt yourself with heavier weights. Like I said, it's all in how the weights are used. I am really feeling this workout as well. It is a complete workout. The cardio in this is slightly reduced from the previous workout, but it is still there and you're still going to feel it. This is also a really amazing workout.A note:These workouts aren't leveled. They are 2 separate and equally challenging workouts- one has more of a focus on cardio and the other a focus on strength, but you get both in each of these workouts. This yoga workout puts her Yoga Meltdown dvd to shame, and I really like that one. Initially, I hated that one because it was not what I was used to with yoga, but after a back injury left me unable to do much besides yoga for a time, I grew very fond of that dvd. This one is definitely my new favorite.",5,I was a little concerned at first,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,3638,"['word', 'CAUTION', 'not', 'yoga', 'are', 'probably', 'used', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Jillian', 'take', 'yoga', 'Yoga', 'Jillian', 'not', 'yoga', 'anyone', 'else', 'So', 'be', 'prepared', 'wonder', 'what', 'earth', 'doing', 'making', 'do', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'yoga', 'completely', 'totally', 'worth', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'nice', 'relaxing', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'when', 'order', 'one.Also', 'when', 'realized', 'Jillian', 'dancers', 'were', 'desert', 'landscape', 'doing', 'yoga', 'aviators', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'waste', 'money', 'little', 'weird', 'first', 'fantastic', 'workout', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'pretty', 'quickly.The', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'set', 'can', 'say', 'movements', 'little', 'fast-', 'even', 'am', 'experienced', 'yoga', 'getting', 'used', 'Normally', 'time', 'tell', 'what', 'move', 'how', 'get', 'mistakes', 'avoid', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'much', 'video', 'okay', 'once', 'do', 'video', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'used', 'anyway', 'then', 'time', 'spend', 'explaining', 'move', 'feels', 'waste', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'huge', 'con', 'Definitely', 'not', 'enough', 'rate', '5', 'stars.THE', 'WORKOUTS', 'Wow', 'one', 'intense', 'cardio', 'yoga', 'ACTUALLY', 'cardio', 'previous', 'dvd', 'combined', 'cardio', 'yoga-', 'sort', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'yoga', 'poses', 'increase', 'heart', 'rate', 'degree', 'THIS', 'workout', 'actual', 'cardio', 'moves', 'yoga', 'sets-', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'squat', 'jacks', 'original', 'plan', 'was', 'do', 'real', 'cardio', 'workout', 'did', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'needing', 'end', 'workout', 'was', 'dying', 'was', 'soaking', 'wet', 'sweat', 'dire', 'need', 'hydration', 'was', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'woke', 'up', 'sore', 'following', 'morning', 'muscles', 'definitely', 'felt', 'as', 'much', 'heart', 'lungs', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'workout.Workout', 'two', 'also', 'intense', 'combines', 'weights', 'yoga', 'poses', 'Be', 'prepared-', 'also', 'cardio', 'intervals', 'too', 'using', '3', 'lb', 'weights', 'did', 'could', 'probably', 'handle', 'heavier', 'weight', 'so', 'desired', 'am', 'coming', 'summer', 'P90X', 'feel', 'pretty', 'good', 'strength', 'abilities', 'right', 'now', 'HOWEVER', 'when', 'are', 'intentional', 'moves', 'use', 'isometric', 'resistance', 'weight', 'training', 'sometimes', '3', 'lbs', 'are', 'enough', 'case', 'felt', 'were', 'enough', 'most', 'time', 'am', 'not', 'trying', 'bulk', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'am', 'trying', 'tone', 'am', 'less', 'concerned', 'heavier', 'weight', 'means', 'need', 'use', 'heavier', 'weight', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'getting', 'something', 'workout-', 'go', 'ahead', 'Just', 'know', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'nuts', 'need', 'be', 'CAREFUL', 'could', 'really', 'hurt', 'heavier', 'weights', 'said', 'how', 'weights', 'are', 'used', 'am', 'really', 'feeling', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'complete', 'workout', 'cardio', 'slightly', 'reduced', 'previous', 'workout', 'still', ""'re"", 'still', 'going', 'feel', 'also', 'really', 'amazing', 'workout.A', 'note', 'workouts', 'are', ""n't"", 'leveled', 'are', '2', 'separate', 'equally', 'challenging', 'workouts-', 'one', 'more', 'focus', 'cardio', 'other', 'focus', 'strength', 'get', 'workouts', 'yoga', 'workout', 'Yoga', 'Meltdown', 'dvd', 'shame', 'really', 'one', 'Initially', 'hated', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'yoga', 'back', 'injury', 'left', 'unable', 'do', 'much', 'yoga', 'time', 'grew', 'very', 'fond', 'dvd', 'one', 'definitely', 'new', 'favorite']",Jillian Michaels Yoga Inferno

1653359,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B00D2YCLF8,Colleen M. Schneider,"[0, 0]","Well, I will hand it to Jillian Michaels in trying to incorporate new things into a workout to make it more dynamic and interesting.  This is her spin on yoga....love it or hate it....I'm not impressed as far as a yoga workout is concerned.  I do many yoga dvds, Shiva Rea, Sara Ivanhoe, Bryan Kest, Rodney Yee, Erich Schiffman, Alan Finger, etc.  I find that each one brings something new to the table and I enjoy all of them.  Bryan Kest is great for a good yoga for cardio, very well cued, heart-pumping but somehow rejuvenating and relaxing.  Jillian's form of yoga is really a few yoga poses such as down dog, up dog, bridge, tree, incorporated with cardio moves (the 2nd disk actually uses weights).  I didn't hate it, I just felt that there was a choppiness to it, it wasn't fluid, it wasn't a relaxed presentation, it was still a bit of yoga with a drill instructor, which kind of evades the purpose that I do yoga, which is to get toned, strong and centered.  Now, aside from being &#34;yoga&#34; as a stand alone workout maybe &#34;inspired&#34; by yoga, it works a little better.  Those who don't have experience with yoga or who enjoy Jillian's other dvd's may really love it.  As always, 30 minutes packs a lot and you are definitely sore the next day.  As a &#34;yoga&#34; dvd I wasn't as impressed.So, to sum it up, two 30 minute programs, both good on cardio, both good with showing modifications and your usual intense instruction style.  If you are looking to start a yoga practice, this isn't it.  I would recommend this for intermediate exercisers who just want a little yoga in with their cardio.  The program definitely did not flow like some of the other instructors I mentioned.  If you are looking to start a program, I think Alan Finger's Yoga Zone is a great set as are the Sara Ivanhoe ones.  When you get stronger Bryan Kest and Shiva Rea are great choices.So, for me, I will be returning this to the library and can't see myself purchasing it.  I doubt that I will borrow it again, but it was an interesting concept.",3,"Not yoga, but not a bad workout.....",1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,2046,"['Well', 'will', 'hand', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'trying', 'incorporate', 'new', 'things', 'workout', 'make', 'more', 'dynamic', 'interesting', 'spin', 'yoga', '.love', 'hate', ""'m"", 'not', 'impressed', 'as', 'far', 'yoga', 'workout', 'concerned', 'do', 'many', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Erich', 'Schiffman', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'etc', 'find', 'one', 'something', 'new', 'table', 'enjoy', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'great', 'good', 'yoga', 'cardio', 'very', 'well', 'cued', 'heart-pumping', 'somehow', 'rejuvenating', 'relaxing', 'Jillian', 'form', 'yoga', 'really', 'few', 'yoga', 'poses', 'such', 'down', 'dog', 'up', 'dog', 'bridge', 'tree', 'incorporated', 'cardio', 'moves', '2nd', 'disk', 'actually', 'weights', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'choppiness', 'was', ""n't"", 'fluid', 'was', ""n't"", 'relaxed', 'presentation', 'was', 'still', 'bit', 'yoga', 'drill', 'instructor', 'kind', 'evades', 'purpose', 'do', 'yoga', 'get', 'toned', 'strong', 'centered', 'Now', 'aside', 'being', '34', 'yoga', '34', 'stand', 'alone', 'maybe', '34', 'inspired', '34', 'yoga', 'little', 'better', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'yoga', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Jillian', 'other', 'dvd', 'may', 'really', 'love', 'always', '30', 'minutes', 'lot', 'are', 'definitely', 'next', 'day', '34', 'yoga', '34', 'dvd', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed.So', 'sum', 'up', 'two', '30', 'minute', 'programs', 'good', 'cardio', 'good', 'showing', 'modifications', 'usual', 'intense', 'instruction', 'style', 'are', 'looking', 'start', 'yoga', 'practice', ""n't"", 'would', 'recommend', 'intermediate', 'exercisers', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'little', 'yoga', 'cardio', 'program', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'other', 'instructors', 'mentioned', 'are', 'looking', 'start', 'program', 'think', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'great', 'set', 'are', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'ones', 'When', 'get', 'stronger', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'are', 'great', 'choices.So', 'will', 'be', 'returning', 'library', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'purchasing', 'doubt', 'will', 'borrow', 'again', 'was', 'interesting', 'concept']",Jillian Michaels Yoga Inferno

I work out 5-6 days a week and I have been working out most of my life. This Yoga was fun, challenging and I got a lot out  of it. I ended up purchasing 3 more DVD's of hers because I like this one so much. I'm waiting for them to come in the mail now. I  read all of the reveiws so I could make sure the ones I bought were the favorites for advanced people and I'm so looking forward to them. I get bored fast and I mix up my workouts with running, pilates, P90X, I do 3-6 miles on the stairs a few times a week, I just like a challenge and I like to feel like I really did something when I'm done.
