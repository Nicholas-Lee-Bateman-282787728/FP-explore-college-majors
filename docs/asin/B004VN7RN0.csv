1430084,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B004VN7RN0,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 2]","--------------------------------------------------------""Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune""--------------------------------------------------------Of all the 'Sixties folkies, Phil Ochs was always my favorite -- his political songs were unmatched in their effectiveness and honesty, scathing and uncompromised, but uncompromised in the best possible way, largely due to Ochs' keen sense of humor and biting wit.  It's a shame that he wasn't able to sustain that same sense of balance in his own life, which was sadly ended by suicide in 1976, as the turbulence of the radical '60s counterculture gave way to the narcissism and cultural malaise of the '70s.  Ochs' fate wasn't entirely tied to the changing times -- as this movie makes amply clear, he was beset by a lifelong struggle with mental illness, a manic-depressive streak that led him to dream of stardom and to spiral into an alcohol-fueled depression when, after a decade of impressive labors, stardom failed to materialize.I've read a couple of books about Ochs and his career, and knew where this story would lead, but somehow seeing it played out against an impressive array of archival photos and footage, as well as numerous contemporary interviews, was much more moving. Especially compelling are the interviews with his closest friends and allies, including Christopher Hitchens, Peter Yarrow, Pete Seeger, Sean Penn, Tom Hayden, and most importantly Ochs' family - his daughter Megan, his wife, his sister and his brother Michael Ochs, who struggled with some of the same personal issues, but became one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the '60s scene, as the owner of the Michael Ochs Archive, which owns the rights to innumerable pop-culture images. They all have had decades to sort through their feelings about Phil Ochs' life, his tragic final years and to make sense of his legacy. The pain is still there, including the old pains of dealing with a troubled, charismatic addict, but the affection they felt has also had time to settle, and the love they all felt for this vibrant, creative idealist is palpable in a way that a book simply cannot convey.Equally compelling is the archival material -- Ochs has always been a figure on old LPs for me, a voice on the radio, a presence in music rather than film.  Seeing him singing at civil rights rallies, on TV shows, being interviewed or in old home movies is a powerful experience.  The brightness in his eyes, the hopefulness and earnest power, as well as his charisma and handsomeness -- it's very captivating. You get a strong sense for what a powerful sway he must have held over the folkie legions of the Greenwich Village scene.I was also surprised to find how pivotal he was to the development and radicalization of the antiwar movement in the late '60s -- Ochs wasn't just a songwriting cheerleader, he was an activist and idea man, helping plan and organize major events such as the agitprop ""War Is Over"" demonstrations, and the doomed, decade-defining demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic Convention. When the Chilean coup of 1973 led to the murder of folk singer Victor Jara, it was Ochs who organized a memorial concert, an event that placed Chilean solidarity square in the middle of '70s left-liberal politics, and when Richard Nixon resigned, he came up with the idea of throwing a celebration party. But the contradictions of being an anti-establishment activist and also wanting to become a musical star placed him under huge pressures -- the film doesn't exactly break it all down (nor do the books) but those closest to him, particularly his brother, offer regretful insights into the emotions that tore Ochs apart. This film ably evokes the power and glory of Phil Ochs, as well as the times he struggled in, and the difference he made. I would love to see more footage, particularly uncut performances and longer clips from the talk shows and new programs, but for now, this is quite a moving portrait. Highly recommended!

1430085,A3AWLFMKGRMI5M,B004VN7RN0,E. Karasik,"[0, 2]","Many years ago Robert Aubrey Davis played the Phil Ochs song ""When I'm Gone"" on his radio show and it just floored me; it was and remains one of the most beautiful and moving songs I've ever heard. Despite that fact, I never really got into Ochs's music in a big way or listened to it the way I listened to so many other folk singers. The songs are witty, brilliant, tragic, and topical, but perhaps at some level just not as ""listenable"" or accessible to me. Nevertheless, I was really pleased to see that this documentary had been made, and that it is very worthwhile, if heartbreaking on many levels. Heartbreaking because the violence of the Vietnam War, the Pinochet coup in Chile, and all the political assassinations in this country during the 1960's come flooding back and one feels them through the filter of Ochs's moral outrage. Heartbreaking because despite (or because of) his courageous and compassionate heart, Ochs succumbed to the demons of alcoholism and mental illness. Heartbreaking because the nation and the world are still torn by war and bigotry, albeit progress has arguably been made on some fronts. But it's worth getting your heart broken out of respect for Ochs's memory; this is an important film for the history of the country and the history of folk music. I also was very interested to learn that Ochs had traveled to Chile and Africa and played world music way before that became a popular trend. If he had lived, he might well have reinvented himself and enjoyed a major comeback.",5,Breaks your heart,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,1515,"['Many', 'years', 'ago', 'Robert', 'Aubrey', 'Davis', 'played', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'song', 'When', ""'m"", 'Gone', 'radio', 'show', 'just', 'floored', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'Ochs', 'music', 'big', 'way', 'listened', 'way', 'listened', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'folk', 'singers', 'songs', 'are', 'witty', 'brilliant', 'tragic', 'topical', 'perhaps', 'level', 'just', 'not', 'listenable', 'accessible', 'Nevertheless', 'was', 'really', 'pleased', 'see', 'documentary', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'heartbreaking', 'many', 'levels', 'Heartbreaking', 'violence', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Pinochet', 'coup', 'Chile', 'political', 'assassinations', 'country', '1960', 'come', 'flooding', 'back', 'one', 'feels', 'filter', 'Ochs', 'moral', 'outrage', 'Heartbreaking', 'courageous', 'compassionate', 'heart', 'Ochs', 'succumbed', 'demons', 'alcoholism', 'mental', 'illness', 'Heartbreaking', 'nation', 'world', 'are', 'still', 'torn', 'war', 'bigotry', 'albeit', 'progress', 'arguably', 'been', 'made', 'fronts', 'worth', 'getting', 'heart', 'respect', 'Ochs', 'memory', 'important', 'film', 'history', 'country', 'history', 'folk', 'music', 'also', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'learn', 'Ochs', 'had', 'traveled', 'Chile', 'Africa', 'played', 'world', 'music', 'way', 'became', 'popular', 'trend', 'had', 'lived', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'reinvented', 'enjoyed', 'major', 'comeback']",Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune
1430086,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B004VN7RN0,James Morris,"[10, 10]","Phil Ochs was a folk singer and songwriter who got his start in the early 1960's and is best known for his anti-war and pro-civil rights songs.  That in itself does not distinguish him; there were many folk singers who sang topical political songs in the 1960's.  What does stand out, however, is that he was easily one of the most talented songwriters to come out of that era and style, challenging many of the best known folk artists with lyrics of topical beauty and potency.I first became aware of Phil Ochs a few years after his death.  I have always preferred lyrics of substance to popular songs and love songs.  The first time I heard him, I was struck by the anger of his words, which were coolly contrasted by his soothing voice and plaintive guitar.  Phil Ochs saw himself as someone who could make a difference and his pointed lyrics were always directed where he thought they could do the most good.  Of particular power were the songs he wrote about racial injustice.  When N.A.A.C.P activist Medgar Evers was assassinated, Ochs responded with Too Many Martyrs, a song which not only wrung all the possible emotion out of this tragedy, it powerfully skewered the killer's brutality with all the anger and rage appropriate to such a cowardly crime.  ""While we waited for the future for freedom through the land, the country gained a killer and the country lost a man.""  This song alone would be a remarkable legacy if it was the only hard-hitting, angry and perfectly placed lyric he ever wrote.  But it was just one of dozens of songs that Phil Ochs wrote that seemed to single-handedly take on all the injustices of a generation.  The eloquence of his lyrics, the rage at the status-quo, and the utter absurdity of many of the incidents he wrote about came together to form a perfect commentary on an imperfect world.This Documentary covers multiple aspects of Phil Ochs' life and legacy.  There were more than a few facts of which I was not previously aware, and the circumstances of his suicide are finally clearer and easier to accept.  The film contains many voiceovers by the artist himself, a device which at times makes it sound like he is narrating his own life story.  I always knew that Ochs wanted to be ""popular"" and that the popularity he sought eluded him for the most part, even while he left behind an important body of politically charged work.  I was not aware of his deep but surreptitious rivalry with Bob Dylan, or that the two were close friends.  While some of his songs seem relevant only to the turbulent sixties, a remarkable number of his lyrics are still capable of stirring deep emotions, even more than forty years after he recorded them.  There But For Fortune, Changes, and the eerily prophetic When I'm Gone are songs I have listened to hundreds of times over the past thirty-five years, and I never tire of them.  As for the songs that were ripped from then-current headlines four decades ago, I often find that it's comforting to listen to Too Many Martyrs, Here's To the State of Mississippi, Santo Domingo or Is Anybody Here and know that somebody gave a damn.  That somebody was Phil Ochs and his music will continue to live as long as we remember these struggles and face new ones.As an entertainment, a commentary on the life of Phil Ochs, or as a history of the changing times of the sixties, I cannot recommend the documentary Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune heartily enough.  I thought I knew the man through his music, but there was much, much more to his story than I was able to glean from his music alone, and this film covers much of it.It appears that the soundtrack for the film is now out of print.  That's a shame, as it contains a lovely acoustic version of No More Songs that I have been unable to find anywhere else.  I am hoping that eventually I can pick up a used copy of the CD at a reasonable price.Anyone who is familiar with Phil Ochs music but not his life needs to see this film.  If you are unfamiliar with his music, viewing the film will be an amazing experience.  The documentary includes commentary by Sean Penn, Joan Baez, Judy Henske, Christopher Hitchens and many more.  And to anyone who wants to know more about his wonderful music, I suggest you start with the Elektra CD with the same name as this film (There But For Fortune).  In the meanwhile, I leave you with but one verse of There But For Fortune; you decide if his lyrics will reach you or not.Show me the alley, show me the trainShow me the hobo who sleeps out in the rainAnd I'll show you a young man with many reasons whyThere but for fortune may go you or I...Highly recommended.",5,A Tortured Soul Yields Beautiful Songs,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,4632,"['Phil', 'Ochs', 'was', 'folk', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'who', 'got', 'start', 'early', '1960', 'best', 'known', 'anti-war', 'pro-civil', 'rights', 'songs', 'not', 'distinguish', 'were', 'many', 'folk', 'singers', 'who', 'sang', 'topical', 'political', 'songs', '1960', 'What', 'stand', 'out', 'however', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'songwriters', 'come', 'era', 'style', 'challenging', 'many', 'best', 'known', 'folk', 'artists', 'lyrics', 'topical', 'beauty', 'potency.I', 'first', 'became', 'aware', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'few', 'years', 'death', 'have', 'always', 'preferred', 'lyrics', 'substance', 'popular', 'songs', 'love', 'songs', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'was', 'struck', 'anger', 'words', 'were', 'coolly', 'contrasted', 'soothing', 'voice', 'plaintive', 'guitar', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'saw', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'difference', 'pointed', 'lyrics', 'were', 'always', 'directed', 'where', 'thought', 'could', 'do', 'most', 'good', 'particular', 'power', 'were', 'songs', 'wrote', 'racial', 'injustice', 'When', 'N.A.A.C.P', 'activist', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Ochs', 'responded', 'Too', 'Many', 'Martyrs', 'song', 'not', 'only', 'wrung', 'possible', 'emotion', 'tragedy', 'powerfully', 'skewered', 'killer', 'brutality', 'anger', 'rage', 'appropriate', 'cowardly', 'crime', 'waited', 'future', 'freedom', 'land', 'country', 'gained', 'killer', 'country', 'lost', 'man', 'song', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'remarkable', 'legacy', 'was', 'only', 'hard-hitting', 'angry', 'perfectly', 'placed', 'lyric', 'ever', 'wrote', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'dozens', 'songs', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'wrote', 'seemed', 'single-handedly', 'take', 'injustices', 'generation', 'eloquence', 'lyrics', 'rage', 'status-quo', 'utter', 'absurdity', 'many', 'incidents', 'wrote', 'about', 'came', 'together', 'form', 'perfect', 'commentary', 'imperfect', 'world.This', 'Documentary', 'multiple', 'aspects', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'life', 'legacy', 'were', 'more', 'few', 'facts', 'was', 'not', 'previously', 'aware', 'circumstances', 'suicide', 'are', 'finally', 'clearer', 'easier', 'accept', 'film', 'many', 'voiceovers', 'artist', 'device', 'times', 'sound', 'narrating', 'own', 'life', 'story', 'always', 'knew', 'Ochs', 'wanted', 'be', 'popular', 'popularity', 'sought', 'eluded', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'left', 'behind', 'important', 'body', 'politically', 'charged', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'deep', 'surreptitious', 'rivalry', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'two', 'were', 'close', 'friends', 'songs', 'seem', 'relevant', 'only', 'turbulent', 'sixties', 'remarkable', 'number', 'lyrics', 'are', 'still', 'capable', 'stirring', 'deep', 'emotions', 'even', 'more', 'forty', 'years', 'recorded', 'Fortune', 'Changes', 'eerily', 'prophetic', 'When', ""'m"", 'Gone', 'are', 'songs', 'have', 'listened', 'hundreds', 'times', 'past', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'never', 'tire', 'songs', 'were', 'ripped', 'then-current', 'headlines', 'four', 'decades', 'ago', 'often', 'find', 'comforting', 'listen', 'Too', 'Many', 'Martyrs', 'Here', 'State', 'Mississippi', 'Santo', 'Domingo', 'Anybody', 'Here', 'know', 'somebody', 'gave', 'damn', 'somebody', 'was', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'music', 'will', 'continue', 'live', 'as', 'long', 'remember', 'struggles', 'face', 'new', 'entertainment', 'commentary', 'life', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'history', 'changing', 'times', 'sixties', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'Fortune', 'heartily', 'enough', 'thought', 'knew', 'man', 'music', 'there', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'was', 'able', 'glean', 'music', 'alone', 'film', 'much', 'it.It', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'now', 'print', 'shame', 'lovely', 'acoustic', 'version', 'No', 'More', 'have', 'been', 'unable', 'find', 'anywhere', 'else', 'am', 'hoping', 'eventually', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'used', 'copy', 'CD', 'reasonable', 'price.Anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'music', 'not', 'life', 'needs', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'music', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'amazing', 'experience', 'documentary', 'commentary', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'Judy', 'Henske', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens', 'many', 'more', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'wonderful', 'music', 'suggest', 'start', 'Elektra', 'CD', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'Fortune', 'meanwhile', 'leave', 'one', 'verse', 'Fortune', 'decide', 'lyrics', 'will', 'reach', 'not.Show', 'alley', 'show', 'trainShow', 'hobo', 'who', 'out', 'rainAnd', ""'ll"", 'show', 'young', 'man', 'many', 'reasons', 'whyThere', 'fortune', 'may', 'go', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune

1430089,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004VN7RN0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[50, 52]","I'm ashamed to confess that, despite name recognition, I knew little about Phil Ochs before watching Kenneth Bowser's surprisingly comprehensive new documentary ""Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune.""  Considering that Ochs died in 1975, there are still plenty of people around to readily share his story as well as his legacy.  And the documentary does an excellent job of balancing the story of the man with the story of his music--giving one of the most well rounded biographies that you might hope for.  A contemporary of Baez and Dylan, Ochs was decidedly more pointed and politicized in his lyrics and defied categorization as a typical folk singer.  From idealism, to a pursuit of fame, to an anger at the status quo, to utter despondency--Ochs' personal struggles often ran parallel to the times in which he lived.  His remarkable journey is highlighted in vivid, and uncompromising, detail and the film showcases a true artist whose impact and relevancy are still felt.Ochs truly saw song as a form of revolution and was inspired to write about contemporary news stories encompassing subjects as important as the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War.  The film interviews family members, music scene contemporaries, political activists, and many more in detailing how important Ochs was to the emerging and changing musical scene of the sixties.  These interviews are informative and enlightening and juxtaposed with plenty of archival footage that brings Ochs to the forefront.  And through it all, the soundtrack is filled with recordings and concert performances that show Ochs' talent to maximum affect.  In addition to the music and the contemporary interviews, Ochs' own words (through past interviews, etc) really make you understand the man--in all his glory and with all his foibles.  Seriously, this is a very intimate portrait--remarkable in that it is more than 35 years after his death.The film follows the real arc of Ochs' life, and consequently, it is not always a pleasant experience.  But it is a strong, powerful, and unexpectedly moving look at one man's pursuit of meaning in a confused world.  And despite Ochs' personal contradictions and demons, he did make a difference and influence a generation to social awareness.  It's a noteworthy story told well in a very solidly constructed film!  The film ends with a quote from Ochs' daughter which really encapsulates the surprising impact that this film had on me.  It's a pitch perfect note to cap off the legacy of a musical pioneer.  If you have any interest in Ochs, folk music, activism, the sixties, or just great documentaries--this is a strong and easy recommendation.

Hyland ""Nutrition Nut""","[1, 1]","For anyone who may or may not be familiar with the wonderful work of Phil Ochs, this dvd is enlightening in a number of ways. Firstly, for those not familiar, it will give you a glimpse into the wonderful music of this troubador who wrote about the times he lived in. I would not refer to him as a folkie, but for the times, he got caught in it a bit. You will learn of the extreme violence in the early-mid 60s of which Phil wrote and sang: the civil race riots, the harm done to the farm worker or coal minor, the violence that erupted during the Vietnam war inside America throughout the universities across the country. You'll learn of the horror that was the National Democratic convention in 1968, when mayor Daley authorized his police force to use whatever means possible to eradicate what had been peaceful demonstrations. Imagine college students being shot down! It was a lot to write about and Phil wrote it all. His sweet voice can be heard throughout the sometimes disturbing images, but he did what he did and I feel this dvd captures the essence of Phil. Thanks in large part go to his brother Michael, sister Sonny, daughter Meegan and others, of course. This is a great dvd to watch, whether you're a music person or interested in that volatile time in history (like today).",5,Phil Ochs' DVD Review,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,1292,"['anyone', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'wonderful', 'work', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'dvd', 'enlightening', 'number', 'ways', 'Firstly', 'not', 'familiar', 'will', 'give', 'glimpse', 'wonderful', 'music', 'troubador', 'who', 'wrote', 'times', 'lived', 'would', 'not', 'refer', 'folkie', 'times', 'got', 'caught', 'bit', 'will', 'learn', 'extreme', 'violence', 'early-mid', '60s', 'Phil', 'wrote', 'sang', 'civil', 'race', 'riots', 'harm', 'done', 'farm', 'worker', 'coal', 'minor', 'violence', 'erupted', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'America', 'universities', 'country', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'horror', 'was', 'National', 'Democratic', 'convention', '1968', 'when', 'mayor', 'Daley', 'authorized', 'police', 'force', 'use', 'means', 'possible', 'eradicate', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'peaceful', 'demonstrations', 'Imagine', 'college', 'students', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'was', 'lot', 'write', 'Phil', 'wrote', 'sweet', 'voice', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'images', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'feel', 'dvd', 'essence', 'Phil', 'Thanks', 'large', 'part', 'go', 'brother', 'Michael', 'sister', 'Sonny', 'daughter', 'Meegan', 'others', 'course', 'great', 'dvd', 'watch', ""'re"", 'music', 'person', 'interested', 'volatile', 'time', 'history', 'today']",Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune

1430093,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B004VN7RN0,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[26, 28]","I can only wonder what kinds of songs singer/songwriter (before that label was ever used) Phil Ochs would be writing today - or for the last 35 years - if he had not taken his own life, at age 35, in 1976. He was in Greenwich Village writing both protest songs and ballads BEFORE Bob Dylan arrived. For a short period they were ""competitors"" (at least in Ochs' eyes). I had the true please of seeing Ochs perform live twice in a small coffee house in Philadelphia and I was at Philly's Electric Factory when Ochs repeated his ""gold lame'"" show the night after what became known as the ""The Gunfight at Carnegie Hall"", an interesting even released by A&M; on Lp. Ochs was a passionate and thoughtful man and yet he had to fight his own demons. But he wrote songs that are still sung today - ""Changes"", for instance - and many of the things Ochs wrote about  - war, corrupt politics - are still with us.Years ago there was talk about a film bio of Ochs which was to star Sean Penn (who I think would be perfect). This project never got off the ground but - in 2010 - documentary filmmaker Kenneth Bowser crafted this documentary about Ochs' life and it received limited National distribution. Now that it is out on home video DVD, it should reach a wider audience. While I know Ochs fans - who followed his career - will want to see the film (and it's GREAT!), I hope a younger generation - those born since Ochs' death - will seek it out.There is really not a lot of performance footage of Ochs out there and I'm surprised that Bowser could dig up this much. (It might help that Phil's younger brother Michael, who became his manager, runs Michael Ochs Archive - one of the largest licensed image collections in the world. Bowser got a lot of cooperation from those in the folk music community like Pete Seeger and Joan Baez and there are interview with the non-singing activists of the period like Tom Hayden and Paul Krassner. There are interviews with siblings Michael and Sunny; Ochs' widow Alice and only daughter Meegan.I see this film as a ""living scrapbook"" It ends with ultra rare - and very sad - final footage of Ochs by a New York filmmaker. The film runs 98 minutes and you'll wish there were more. There are excerpts of Ochs performing over 40 of his own songs. Sadly the DVD's only extras are the two-minute ""trailer"". It's wishful thinking, but I'd loved to see the outtakes of the interviews.Watch this film and share it with your children. They need to know who Phil Ochs was, and what he stood for. And thank you Ken Bowser, for keeping his name alive and to First Run Features for making it available fist in theaters and now on home DVD.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,MUST SEE and loving documentary on Phil Ochs - a singer/songwriter before that word was coined.,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,2690,"['can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'kinds', 'songs', 'singer/songwriter', 'label', 'was', 'ever', 'used', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'would', 'be', 'writing', 'today', 'last', '35', 'years', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'own', 'life', 'age', '35', '1976', 'was', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'writing', 'protest', 'songs', 'ballads', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'arrived', 'short', 'period', 'were', 'competitors', 'least', 'Ochs', 'eyes', 'had', 'true', 'please', 'seeing', 'Ochs', 'perform', 'live', 'twice', 'small', 'coffee', 'house', 'Philadelphia', 'was', 'Philly', 'Electric', 'Factory', 'when', 'Ochs', 'repeated', 'gold', 'lame', 'show', 'night', 'what', 'became', 'known', 'Gunfight', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'interesting', 'even', 'released', 'A', 'M', 'Lp', 'Ochs', 'was', 'passionate', 'thoughtful', 'man', 'yet', 'had', 'fight', 'own', 'demons', 'wrote', 'songs', 'are', 'still', 'sung', 'today', 'Changes', 'instance', 'many', 'things', 'Ochs', 'wrote', 'war', 'corrupt', 'politics', 'are', 'still', 'us.Years', 'ago', 'was', 'talk', 'film', 'bio', 'Ochs', 'was', 'star', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'project', 'never', 'got', 'ground', '2010', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Kenneth', 'Bowser', 'crafted', 'documentary', 'Ochs', 'life', 'received', 'limited', 'National', 'distribution', 'Now', 'out', 'home', 'video', 'DVD', 'should', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience', 'know', 'Ochs', 'fans', 'who', 'followed', 'career', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'GREAT', 'hope', 'younger', 'generation', 'born', 'Ochs', 'death', 'will', 'seek', 'out.There', 'really', 'not', 'lot', 'performance', 'footage', 'Ochs', 'there', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Bowser', 'could', 'dig', 'up', 'much', 'might', 'help', 'Phil', 'younger', 'brother', 'Michael', 'who', 'became', 'manager', 'Michael', 'Ochs', 'Archive', 'one', 'largest', 'licensed', 'image', 'collections', 'world', 'Bowser', 'got', 'lot', 'cooperation', 'folk', 'music', 'community', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'are', 'interview', 'non-singing', 'activists', 'period', 'Tom', 'Hayden', 'Paul', 'Krassner', 'are', 'interviews', 'siblings', 'Michael', 'Sunny', 'Ochs', 'widow', 'Alice', 'only', 'daughter', 'Meegan.I', 'see', 'film', 'living', 'scrapbook', 'ultra', 'rare', 'very', 'sad', 'final', 'footage', 'Ochs', 'New', 'York', 'filmmaker', 'film', '98', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'are', 'excerpts', 'Ochs', 'performing', '40', 'own', 'songs', 'Sadly', 'DVD', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'two-minute', 'trailer', 'wishful', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'loved', 'see', 'outtakes', 'interviews.Watch', 'film', 'share', 'children', 'need', 'know', 'who', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'was', 'what', 'stood', 'thank', 'Ken', 'Bowser', 'keeping', 'name', 'alive', 'First', 'Run', 'Features', 'making', 'available', 'fist', 'theaters', 'now', 'home', 'DVD.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune
