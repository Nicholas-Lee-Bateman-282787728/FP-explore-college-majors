The movie highlights Sinatra's rise to the top, giving more emphasis to his early struggles rather than the more well known Vegas years. I would not have thought to cast Phillip Casnoff as Sinatra but he was surprisingly good at mimicking Sinatra's moves. Caught from some angles he really looked the part, showing off Sinatra's signature jawline and angular features. Olympia Dukakis however was a real gem as spunky Dolly Sinatra. One switch I would have made is to cast Marcia Gay Harden as sedate housewife Nancy and Gina Gershon as love goddess Ava Gardner, instead of vice-versa. Overall, watch this for a great cast, wonderful story, and the use of many, many of Sinatra's fabulous music.",4,"Interesting cast, fabulous music!",1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,749,"['miniseries', 'rerun', 'cable', 'movie', 'highlights', 'Sinatra', 'rise', 'top', 'giving', 'more', 'emphasis', 'early', 'struggles', 'rather', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'Vegas', 'years', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'thought', 'cast', 'Phillip', 'Casnoff', 'Sinatra', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'mimicking', 'Sinatra', 'moves', 'Caught', 'angles', 'really', 'looked', 'part', 'showing', 'off', 'Sinatra', 'signature', 'jawline', 'angular', 'features', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'however', 'was', 'real', 'gem', 'spunky', 'Dolly', 'Sinatra', 'One', 'switch', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'cast', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'sedate', 'housewife', 'Nancy', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'love', 'goddess', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'instead', 'vice-versa', 'Overall', 'watch', 'great', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'story', 'use', 'many', 'many', 'Sinatra', 'fabulous', 'music']",N/A

According to several Sinatra biographers, Frank gave this picture his blessing because his daughter Tina was Executive Producer. However, he thought that the story would gloss over his ""bad moments"" and was in a rage when he viewed the finished film and saw that his drinking, womanizing, and temper tantrums were on full display. In fairness, the movie also shows the man as the magnificent entertainer he always was. The cast is fine. Phillip Casnoff, a veteran broadway performer steps into Sinatra's tux real well, although he's clearly a lot more handsome and well built then the real thing ever was. At the same time, although Gina Gerson did great as first wife Nancy, I always thought she would have been better as Ava Gardner. The rest of the supporting cast is great also such as James F. Kelly who's made a career playing Jack and Bobby Kennedy(he's JFK in this one) And the legendary Rod Stieger who is chilling as Sam Giancana. Don't miss Las Vegas fixture Danny Gans in a couple of brief scenes as Dean Martin. For a TV flick the costuming and cinematography are excellent. And above all, the incomparable recordings from the Chairman of the board are on display.",5,At Last,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,1287,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'film', 'go', 'DVD', 'were', 'created', 'have', 'VHS', 'copy', 'was', 'wearing', 'out', 'According', 'several', 'Sinatra', 'biographers', 'Frank', 'gave', 'picture', 'blessing', 'daughter', 'Tina', 'was', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'However', 'thought', 'story', 'would', 'gloss', 'bad', 'moments', 'was', 'rage', 'when', 'viewed', 'finished', 'film', 'saw', 'drinking', 'womanizing', 'tantrums', 'were', 'full', 'display', 'fairness', 'movie', 'also', 'man', 'magnificent', 'entertainer', 'always', 'was', 'cast', 'fine', 'Phillip', 'Casnoff', 'veteran', 'broadway', 'performer', 'steps', 'Sinatra', 'tux', 'real', 'well', 'clearly', 'lot', 'more', 'handsome', 'well', 'built', 'then', 'real', 'thing', 'ever', 'was', 'same', 'time', 'Gina', 'Gerson', 'did', 'great', 'first', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'always', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'also', 'such', 'James', 'F.', 'Kelly', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'JFK', 'one', 'legendary', 'Rod', 'Stieger', 'who', 'chilling', 'Sam', 'Giancana', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'fixture', 'Danny', 'Gans', 'couple', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'TV', 'flick', 'costuming', 'cinematography', 'are', 'excellent', 'incomparable', 'recordings', 'Chairman', 'board', 'are', 'display']",N/A

I would have liked to see a little more of the rat pack stuff.  The guy playing Sammie Davis Jr was wonderful. In fact, all the roles were well cast except that of Ava Gardner.  Ava was tall and very willowy with a slim heart shaped face. I think they cast this just for the cleft in the chin and forgot that this actress is chubby all over and she didn't make any attempt at all to sound like Ava. In the scene where she is supposed to be Flamenco dancing she was clumping around with her arms just hanging there.  Horrible.  I thought she was a distraction from the rest of the movie which was excellent.  Philip Casnoff did a wonderful job all the way through. He was too heavy set for the young years when Frank was so painful skinny but he still portrayed him extremely well. As Frank ages in the movie, this actor looked more and more like him.  In fact, he looks a lot like Frank Sinatra Jr.  I was never a great fan of Sinatra but I enjoyed this movie very much. MONTHS LATER: I have just viewed this film again. It is still excellent. Marsha Gay Harden is still terrible as Ava Gardner. Since she is in the movie for a long time it is very annoying.

Tina Sinatra, his daughter was a producer of this film so it is as close to the real thing as it gets.Philip Casnoff has the opportunity to be Frank, and does so very well.  He is VERY believable.  You can tell that he took time to study Frank very hard because he picked up his accent and body movements.This film starts well, at the beginning!  It shows the odds that were against him and his great desire to sing.  He begins his career in the Hoboken 4, and sings &quot;Shine&quot; which becomes somewhat a hit. The 4 hour long movie goes through his life, depicting his rise to stardom as he sings with Harry James, and Tommy Dorsey.  It also takes you through many loves and many movies that he filmed like On the Town, and Pal Joey.  The film even portrays the acedemy award ceremony where he wins best oscar for From Here To Eternity.When I watched this movie, I felt like I was really watching Frank's life being lived in front of me.  You hear his music all throughout the film.  After you watch Sinatra, check out a book and cd set called Frank Sinatra An American Legend.  The cd contains most of the music that he sang in the movie as well as commericals and promotions that he did!If you have always wanted to know how Frank lived it, checks this movie out.
