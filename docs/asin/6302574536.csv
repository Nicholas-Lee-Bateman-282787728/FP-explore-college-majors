321190,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,6302574536,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[6, 6]","""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" is a campy cult classic. It contains many, many flaws, but it seems to be this bad on purpose. Without a huge budget or an extensive track record, the makers of this cult classic dove right in and made a spectacularly bad, yet at the same time, really excellent movie. Though the story is a composite of successful films of this genre, the script is silly, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is at times touch-and-go, and the film stock is of questionable quality. But these elements all come together into a viewing experience fans of cheap horror films should really love.The story's rough outline: Ambitious film director Alan Ormsby (the characters have the same names as the actors portraying them) has plans for his small film troupe. He doesn't respect them, but they are obviously the only actors he has encountered who are willing to tolerate his pompousity and his nastiness. This guy is a real turd, by any definition. If you look in Vincent Bugliosi's book about the Manson case, ""Helter Skelter,"" there are pictures of Manson during his beatnik stage (the part where he's called a ""changeling"") which look alarmingly like Ormsby in this film. Alan is insulting, cocky, arrogant, pretentious, belittling, and verbally abusive. You could say he's a psychological bully. He takes his actors to some small burial island to perform a mock Satanic ritual, possibly to test the loyalty of these people, to see just how far they will go when he tells them to do something he knows they won't like.There is a lot of dissention, as they really think this is a bad idea. And they were right. Unintended consequences happen in films of all types; it's a staple of all films, no matter what kind you like. Here, the ritual backfires, and after a while, you have an island teeming with reanimated decomposing corpses. The story apes ""Night Of The Living Dead"" at this point, as they have locked themselves in an old house, trying to think of a way to escape.The zombie invasion, though brief (the final twenty minutes of the film), is actually a remarkable piece of low-budget horror movie galore. The film stock, though cheap, is visually enhanced and the colors have a beautiful pastel tone to them, and the lighting, obviously portable spotlights, serve their purpose, as the zombies really stand out against the backdrops. The zombies themselves have been criticized by this film's haters, but they are actually very well done, each a macabre masterpiece on its own. This film's director also directed the second ""Porky's"" film, and there is a scene in that film involving one of the characters being made up to look like a zombie, and he looks just like one of the ghouls shown here.The soundtrack is a constant barrage of wails, moans, squeaks, and electronic noise; distracting to some, but a perfect compliment for this particular film, and the part where the dead bodies rise from their shallow graves is a caccophany of over-the-top racket, borderline overbearing, but adding to the horror of what's happening. These hideously beautiful, grotesque cadavers are now the walking dead, and per Romero's take on it, they are in search of food, as the central part of the brain is often the last to be affected by decomposition. They are on the hunt, and no living person is safe.Back to the ""Alan"" character: the viewer gets to see Alan's true character when the zombies come after him and sweet little Anya Ormsby. It's astonishing, and even the zombies are surprised at this.This movie is a must-see for fans of cheap, cheesy, campy horror flicks; a technically terrible, but creatively brilliant film.",5,So bad it's good!,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,3655,"['Children', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Play', 'Dead', 'Things', 'campy', 'cult', 'classic', 'many', 'many', 'flaws', 'be', 'bad', 'purpose', 'huge', 'budget', 'extensive', 'track', 'record', 'makers', 'cult', 'classic', 'dove', 'right', 'made', 'spectacularly', 'bad', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'excellent', 'movie', 'story', 'composite', 'successful', 'films', 'genre', 'script', 'silly', 'dialogue', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'times', 'touch-and-go', 'film', 'stock', 'questionable', 'quality', 'elements', 'come', 'together', 'viewing', 'experience', 'fans', 'cheap', 'horror', 'films', 'should', 'really', 'love.The', 'story', 'rough', 'outline', 'Ambitious', 'film', 'director', 'Alan', 'Ormsby', 'characters', 'have', 'same', 'names', 'actors', 'portraying', 'plans', 'small', 'film', 'troupe', ""n't"", 'respect', 'are', 'obviously', 'only', 'actors', 'encountered', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'tolerate', 'pompousity', 'nastiness', 'guy', 'real', 'turd', 'definition', 'look', 'Vincent', 'Bugliosi', 'book', 'Manson', 'case', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'are', 'pictures', 'Manson', 'beatnik', 'stage', 'part', 'where', 'called', 'changeling', 'look', 'alarmingly', 'Ormsby', 'film', 'Alan', 'insulting', 'cocky', 'arrogant', 'pretentious', 'belittling', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'could', 'say', 'psychological', 'bully', 'actors', 'small', 'burial', 'island', 'perform', 'mock', 'Satanic', 'ritual', 'possibly', 'test', 'loyalty', 'people', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'when', 'do', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like.There', 'lot', 'dissention', 'really', 'think', 'bad', 'idea', 'were', 'right', 'Unintended', 'consequences', 'happen', 'films', 'types', 'staple', 'films', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'Here', 'ritual', 'backfires', 'while', 'have', 'island', 'teeming', 'reanimated', 'decomposing', 'corpses', 'story', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'point', 'have', 'locked', 'old', 'house', 'trying', 'think', 'way', 'escape.The', 'zombie', 'invasion', 'brief', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'actually', 'remarkable', 'piece', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'movie', 'galore', 'film', 'stock', 'cheap', 'visually', 'enhanced', 'colors', 'have', 'beautiful', 'pastel', 'tone', 'lighting', 'obviously', 'portable', 'spotlights', 'serve', 'purpose', 'zombies', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'backdrops', 'zombies', 'have', 'been', 'criticized', 'film', 'haters', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'macabre', 'masterpiece', 'own', 'film', 'director', 'also', 'directed', 'second', 'Porky', 'film', 'scene', 'film', 'involving', 'one', 'characters', 'being', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'zombie', 'just', 'one', 'ghouls', 'shown', 'here.The', 'soundtrack', 'constant', 'barrage', 'wails', 'moans', 'squeaks', 'electronic', 'noise', 'distracting', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'particular', 'film', 'part', 'where', 'dead', 'bodies', 'rise', 'shallow', 'graves', 'caccophany', 'over-the-top', 'racket', 'borderline', 'overbearing', 'adding', 'horror', 'what', 'happening', 'hideously', 'beautiful', 'grotesque', 'cadavers', 'are', 'now', 'walking', 'dead', 'Romero', 'take', 'are', 'search', 'food', 'central', 'part', 'brain', 'often', 'last', 'be', 'affected', 'decomposition', 'are', 'hunt', 'living', 'person', 'safe.Back', 'Alan', 'character', 'viewer', 'see', 'Alan', 'true', 'character', 'when', 'zombies', 'come', 'sweet', 'little', 'Anya', 'Ormsby', 'astonishing', 'even', 'zombies', 'are', 'surprised', 'this.This', 'movie', 'must-see', 'fans', 'cheap', 'cheesy', 'campy', 'horror', 'flicks', 'technically', 'terrible', 'creatively', 'brilliant', 'film']",N/A

A group of thespians attempt a Satanic ritual in a graveyard in a comic attempt to raise the dead, but their trespasses don't go unpunished as the corpses return to life to seek revenge. Director Bob Clark of BLACK CHRISTMAS fame brings us this awesome low-budget effort, which starts off with a very light and silly, but quickly descends into a terrifying and bloody zombie shocker. The purposefully over-the-top acting and dialog may turn many fans away initially, but it can be truly appreciated for its dark humor and pure camp value on repeated viewings. Once the evil spell is cast, the living dead that befall our motley group of heroes are completely unlike any other zombies in the genre, with make-up and costumes of all different shapes and designs. For the year it was made and the budget, the FX are very impressive, with many creepy zombies and no lack of blood and gore. The only thing more surprising than the zombies are the societal taboos that are obliterated in the film.

321206,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6302574536,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[3, 5]","I've read a number of reviews of the film Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things (1972), and there seems to be an understandable divide among those who have fond remembrances of seeing the film when originally released (most likely at the drive-in), and those coming in late in the game (like me), only seeing this film on home video, further enforcing my belief that some films should be viewed in a proper setting.  Co-written by Benjamin `Bob' Clark (Black Christmas, Porky's, A Christmas Story) and Alan Ormsby (My Bodyguard, Cat People), and directed by Clark, the film features writer Ormsby as the character of Alan, leader of an ill-fated troupe actors.  Also appearing is Valerie Mamches, Jeff Gillen (who also played Santa Claus in the film A Christmas Story), Anya Ormsby (Thunder County, Dead of Night), Paul Cronin (""The Sullivans""), and Jane Daly (Dead of Night, ""Capitol"").The film starts out in a dimly lit, slightly foggy, ookie looking graveyard, with someone whom I guessing is the caretaker, investigating some strange goings on...all this occurring while some suitable (and sometime annoying) mood music is played, along with about four minutes of credits...you know, I really despise it when the filmmakers dump all the credits at the beginning of a film, so that the audience is forced to sit and watch then, as opposed to showing them at the end, where they below and those interested can stay behind and view them, while those who aren't interested can take off.  Anyway, some ghoulish figures are lurking about, digging up a grave, and the nosey caretaker...well, you'll have to watch the movie to get the rest...next we see a group of young people, clad in some of the worst, 1970s outfits I've seen this side of the television show The Brady Bunch (hard to believe gaudy, tacky, hideously bright, mismatched print shirts and bell bottomed pants were ever an accepted fashion), gathered on a boat, preparing for a midnight cruise.  Seems the group is an acting troupe, their leader Alan (Ormsby), a pretentious, obnoxious, verbose, condescending, thespian pratt type who regularly refers to the rest as `children', is taking them to the graveyard we saw earlier, located on a nearby island, so that they may engage in some sort of black magic ritual involving raising the dead.  They arrive, and spend a good deal of time tromping through the dark, finally reaching the bone yard, to which they endure a prank, and a fat guys wets himself.  They recover a corpse, Alan performs some ritual (which apparently doesn't work, much to Alan's chagrin), and then proceed to a nearby cottage, taking with them the unearthed corpse.  But wait...seems Alan's black magic did work, as corpses begin rising from the grave, and a couple of overly effeminate members of the troupe, left behind to straighten up, and discover what it means to be an entree.  Soon the cottage is besieged and the remaining members learn why children shouldn't play with dead things...I'd agree with some this obscure film certainly has its share of shortcomings, but, I think, viewed in the proper perspective (as pure, unadulterated drive-in fare), it can be fun, especially given the number of appalling 1970s fashion statements perpetrated by most all of the characters.  I read somewhere it was shot for about $70,000 in a matter of fourteen days.  The acting is pretty lousy throughout, but I tried to keep in mind for many appearing here this was an early gig in their careers (for some it was their only gig).  A majority of the actors weren't too bad, but the two that stood out to me as the worst were Alan Ormsby and Anya Ormsby.  For about the first hour the character of Alan smothers the screen with his overbearing, annoying, odious prattle (he really is a pompous, smarmy, demanding, ostentatious, conceited little a-hole of a character), followed closely by the increasingly weird, constantly shrieking, boney, wide-eyed, flower print moo moo clad Anya, who was, I think, supposed to have some sort of affinity for the dead, along with a sensitivity towards the supernatural.  I'm no advocate in violence towards women, but in this case I might have made an exception as its rare I see a character so in need of a good smacking.  The story, which is pretty thin to begin with, is stretched to the point of snapping and drags ponderously along for the first hour or so, finally picking up steam the last twenty minutes as the dead start showing signs life and begin their attack.  Some have stated this is just a poorly made, unoriginal rip off of another, more popular film, and I would probably have a hard time disputing that, but then again, a lot of what comes from the major studios is rehashed from previously made films (look at all the Japanese horror films remade in the past few years).  I did get a sense there was an effort put forth by the filmmakers, and that counts for something with me.  As far as the makeup goes, specifically with regards to the zombies, I thought it was fairly decent, and probably used up a good portion of the budget.  The writing, overall, is shaky at best, and Clark's direction, while lacking (the moody settings were cool), improves vastly with his later release titled Black Christmas (1974), which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I think my favorite scene is near the end, when Alan, in a particularly cowardly manner, offers up Anya in an effort to save himself, and the zombies (at least one of them), gives him an incredulous looks as to say ""Wow, I can't believe you did that"".  At least he stayed true to his rotten, little character all they way to the end.  And speaking of endings, I appreciated the disposition of the cast, given their overall unpalatable natures.The picture quality, presented in non-anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) on this VCI Home Entertainment DVD is lacking, not so much due to a poor transfer, but more so because of an obviously shoddy source print.  There's a little grain, and a lot of discoloration, causing the color to change often throughout, along with a general lack of sharpness.  Near the end something else became present on the right side of the screen, that of a creeping, red-ish tint. VCI claims this version is the restored, uncut, theatrical version, for what its worth.  The Dolby Digital mono audio is about as good as the picture, meaning its not that great (the audio drops out briefly at times).  As far as extras go, there's a small photo gallery, a misleading, original theatrical trailer, and bios for both Bob Clark and Alan Ormsby.  I've heard there is a better release out there somewhere, one released in the UK, featuring an actual commentary track from writer/actor Ormsby, so if you posses an all region DVD player, it might be worth searching out, rather than settling for this one.Cookieman108By the way, it appears Clark is currently in the process of remaking this film, scheduled for a 2006 release.

Reilly,"[2, 4]","On a deserted island that seems to be one big cemetery, Alan and his acting troupe are (God only knows WHY...) getting ready to dig up a little fun. Actually, they're digging up a corpse named Orville, to aid them in a Satanic ritual (Again, it's never explained WHY...). After spending a loooong time doing humilitiating things to poor dead Orville, Alan starts to read the ritual aloud, and the ""Children"" get a little more than they bargained for.....This is strictly grade-Z stuff, so don't expect to see a Romero-level ""Dead"" epic. The acting is amateur-hour, ranging from tolerable to I-want-these-people-DEAD-sooner-rather-than-later (Alan & the shrill Anya). The first hour is interesting at times, but mostly laughable (Those loud hippie clothes!) and interminably sloooowww[...] The last half-hour makes the film worth seeing, though, as the angry dead come to life to punish their defilers. Although the film is PG, with no strong language and no gore, director Bob Clark (Later to find fame as the Director of Porky's 1 & 2, Murder By Decree, and A Christmas Story) manages to make that last half-hour as creepy as hell. (A friend of mine is unable to even look at the box art because the film scared her so badly!)

While watching this one, I kept expecting a disco ball to lower from the trees and the zombies to start layin' down the moves to ""Saturday Night Fever"". I'm talking about the clothes these people used to wear back then, what were they thinking!? It's not like you can blame the costume designer, that's just the way people dressed in 1972, unfortunately for them. All 70s clothes aside, this movie was a very pleasant surprise. Legendary director Bob Clark cut his teeth on this film as one of his first, and would later direct such cult-classics as BLACK CHRISTMAS, PORKY'S, and A CHRISTMAS STORY. He would also team up again with writer/actor Alan Ormsby on the film DEATHDRAM (aka DEAD OF NIGHT).CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS centers on an acting troupe following their not-completely-right-in-the-head director (Alan Ormsby) to a remote burial island. What some people won't do for a big break in Hollywood! I guess it was a good idea at the time...""Hey, let's go to a remote island that's used as a big cemetery. And since we're here, why don't we dig up a corpse?"" Alan, the director, is bringing them there to play a big joke. I won't give away what the joke is, but let's just say that it would a pretty boring movie if something didn't go wrong. Alan does his best impression of a warlock and tries to raise the dead while he's there (hey, who wouldn't!). Does he succeed? Just take a guess.I wasn't very impressed at the beginning of the film, but it definitely grew on me. And once I stopped staring at Alan's multicolored pants (admittedly, that doesn't sound good), you can really get into the feel of the movie. As if under some kind of voodoo charm given off by my TV, I started liking this movie. The cemetery setting that was unimpressive at the start was now getting spookier. The actors playing actors seemed to come into their own. And the music score which had initially annoyed me...well, it still irritated me. Oh that's right, the score never really got any better. It's the only real downer, I think with a better one it could have added to the film's creepy factor.Alan Ormsby's performance of the director was once described by a critic as ""...one of the most obnoxious screen performances in history!"". I think it's a bit harsh. He indeed was obnoxious, but in a B-horror flick good kinda way. He does a pretty good job of getting the audience to dislike him. He's more of a dictator then a director, and treats everyone around him like slaves...but of course they let him, so I can't feel sorry for them. The actors are looking for their big break, so hey, what's a little grave robbing if it will further your career. That makes it okay, right? The rest of the crew give good decent performances, but nobody else steps up and makes you take notice. Overall, I give a thumbs up to the acting.Thumbs go up for the zombies in the film as well. The makeup and effects were pretty good for the low budget and the fact it was 1972, so no complaints there. You get to see zombies with a little bit more strength then you're usually used to. And in the end scene, you see a glimpse of intelligence, or maybe they just lucked up (You'll know what I mean when you see it). If you're a fan of lots of gore, you're not going to get it here. They're just evidently wasn't enough room in the budget for it on this one, as there was little of it. While I'm a fan of well-placed karo syrup and animal entrails as the next guy, it's refreshing to see that to make a decent film you don't need a lot of gore.",3,One of Bob Clark's Earliest and Finest,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,3601,"['nothing', 'watching', 'low-budget', 'zombie', 'flick', '70s', 'watching', 'one', 'kept', 'expecting', 'disco', 'ball', 'lower', 'trees', 'zombies', 'start', 'layin', 'down', 'moves', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', ""'m"", 'talking', 'clothes', 'people', 'used', 'wear', 'back', 'then', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'not', 'can', 'blame', 'costume', 'designer', 'just', 'way', 'people', 'dressed', '1972', 'unfortunately', '70s', 'clothes', 'aside', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Legendary', 'director', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'cut', 'teeth', 'film', 'one', 'first', 'would', 'later', 'direct', 'such', 'cult-classics', 'BLACK', 'CHRISTMAS', 'PORKY', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'STORY', 'would', 'also', 'team', 'up', 'again', 'writer/actor', 'Alan', 'Ormsby', 'film', 'DEATHDRAM', 'aka', 'DEAD', 'OF', 'NIGHT', '.CHILDREN', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'PLAY', 'WITH', 'DEAD', 'THINGS', 'centers', 'acting', 'troupe', 'following', 'not-completely-right-in-the-head', 'director', 'Alan', 'Ormsby', 'remote', 'burial', 'island', 'What', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'big', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'guess', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'time', 'Hey', 'let', 'go', 'remote', 'island', 'used', 'big', 'cemetery', ""'re"", 'here', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'dig', 'up', 'corpse', 'Alan', 'director', 'bringing', 'there', 'play', 'big', 'joke', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'what', 'joke', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'would', 'pretty', 'boring', 'movie', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Alan', 'best', 'impression', 'warlock', 'tries', 'raise', 'dead', 'there', 'hey', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'Just', 'take', 'guess.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressed', 'beginning', 'film', 'definitely', 'grew', 'once', 'stopped', 'staring', 'Alan', 'multicolored', 'pants', 'admittedly', ""n't"", 'sound', 'good', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'movie', 'kind', 'voodoo', 'charm', 'given', 'off', 'TV', 'started', 'liking', 'movie', 'cemetery', 'setting', 'was', 'unimpressive', 'start', 'was', 'now', 'getting', 'spookier', 'actors', 'playing', 'actors', 'seemed', 'come', 'own', 'music', 'score', 'had', 'initially', 'annoyed', 'well', 'still', 'irritated', 'right', 'score', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'better', 'only', 'real', 'downer', 'think', 'better', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'film', 'creepy', 'factor.Alan', 'Ormsby', 'performance', 'director', 'was', 'once', 'described', 'critic', 'one', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'screen', 'performances', 'history', 'think', 'bit', 'harsh', 'indeed', 'was', 'obnoxious', 'B-horror', 'flick', 'good', 'kinda', 'way', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'audience', 'dislike', 'more', 'dictator', 'then', 'director', 'everyone', 'like', 'slaves', 'course', 'let', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'actors', 'are', 'looking', 'big', 'break', 'hey', 'what', 'little', 'grave', 'robbing', 'will', 'further', 'career', 'right', 'rest', 'crew', 'give', 'good', 'decent', 'performances', 'nobody', 'else', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'Overall', 'give', 'thumbs', 'up', 'acting.Thumbs', 'go', 'up', 'zombies', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'makeup', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'fact', 'was', '1972', 'complaints', 'there', 'get', 'see', 'zombies', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'strength', 'then', ""'re"", 'usually', 'used', 'end', 'scene', 'see', 'glimpse', 'intelligence', 'maybe', 'just', 'lucked', 'up', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', ""'re"", 'fan', 'lots', 'gore', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'here', ""'re"", 'just', 'evidently', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'room', 'budget', 'one', 'was', 'little', ""'m"", 'fan', 'well-placed', 'karo', 'syrup', 'animal', 'entrails', 'next', 'guy', 'refreshing', 'see', 'make', 'decent', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lot', 'gore']",N/A

Well, now it's decades later and that drive-in is long gone, replaced in the 80s with a much-ballyhooed mini-screened multiplex (--which has since gone bust, hah!).

Yes, the acting is only marginally better than its illustrious and more famous predecessor, and the dialogue truly has to be heard to be believed. That having been said, this is still a low-budget classic of the genre. I remember that me and my friends loved this when we were teenagers and it was being shown on late-night TV; it still holds up fairly well, although the overblown dialogue does wear thin after awhile. Alan Ormsby is effective as an effete Charles Manson wanna-be and his wife Anya, while she at times overacts shamelessly, still manages to convey a sad, ethereal quality to her character. The others bring off their roles with varying degrees of competence. Still, you're not watching this because of its flamboyant characters or the complexity of its storyline. You're watching it because of the flesh-eating zombies. How do they hold up, 30 or so years later? Very well, considering the budgetary limitations and the passage of the years. In fact, I'll still put the scene where the Undead finally emerge from their graves, summoned either by Alan's pompous Satanic ritual or Valerie's irreverent mockery of the same, up against anything out there. I defy anyone to watch this scene alone late at night and not feel that shivery chill of fear that you probably haven't experienced since you were a child watching ""Chiller Theatre."" There are elements that certainly haven't aged well. The whole concept of a necrophiliac-style wedding is just plain sick, not scary, and if you've ever wondered how much progress gay people have made over the years, check out some of the flagrant stereotypes presented here circa 1972.

321221,A3O7S6FPLIKP5C,6302574536,J.Espresso,"[3, 4]","First off, let me state that this is a BAD movie. BAD not only with a capital B, but with a capital A and D to follow. So why the four star rating?You don't rate B movies with the same scale you would Citizen Kane or The Shining. You rate them on how much of a good time you had watching the movie - and I had a GREAT time watching Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things.I should also admit that I saw this movie (as the reviewer just prior to me has said) on WOR channel 9 in New York City when I was growing up in the early 1980's. We were probably watching it on the same night, on the same network, but in different parts of the city. I thought it was creepy then, but hadn't seen it since, until on a whim, I came home with it after an impulse day-before-Halloween purchase at a local video store. My wife, economically oriented and more accustomed to me renting the classics or foreign films, not only thought I had wasted my money, but that I had also lost my mind. Aah, nostalgia, is there a more powerful force driving our economy? That $10 DVD purchase probably led to the studio that produced this to recoup half their production costs 35 years after the original theatrical release.So yes, this is a TERRIBLE film  - so bad in fact, it's great! Filled with ham-fisted acting and bad dialog from a script ripped out of a Tales from the Crypt Comic, it's more fun than the early-bird special corpse smorgasbord at a Florida restaurant catering to older zombies. It's got almost all of the bad, grade B zombie film cliches - the foggy graveyard, the satanic incantations, the rat-infested rustic cottage, the mouldering corpses. The film score is a constant barrage of creepy sound effects including weird feedback, eerie music and a rather haunting loon-like screeching. And the whole film takes place at night. All that's missing is a thunderstorm, and I really don't know how that cliche was overlooked.It's also refreshing to see a film like this for what it DOESN'T have. No horny teenagers, no pop-soundtrack, and no gratuitious gore. Children works by an older formula, an emphasis on atmosphere and suspense rather than action. It slowly builds to its exciting climax and its somewhat of a surprise denoument ending.This film terrified me when I was 9 back in 1980 on the late night Creature Feature. There's nothing chilling about it now, watching it as a 38 year old, but it entertained me tremendously. I love this film.As a final note, R.I.P. director Benjamin ""Bob"" Clark. He did this film and later made some money with the abysmal Porky's films, before finally striking gold and syndication immortality with ""A Christmas Story"". He died tragically in a car wreck earlier this year, well before having had the opportunity to remake this film (sigh!). Rest easy Bob. With this film alone, you gave me an integral piece of my late night adolescence and adult contemporary film entertainment. You had an impact on at least one life.

321225,AW3I97UR8NP7T,6302574536,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[5, 7]","CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS is the heart warming story of a troupe of quasi-professional actors and their megalomanical director/producer Alan (Alan Ormsby) who decide it would be a nifty idea to go to a deserted island, perform a satanic ritual and raise the dead to serve Alan's every need. And why not? Its 1972. Having reached this conclusion Alan chooses an island that meets certain specific requirements and has the proper ambiance, to wit it has an old cemetery where the dead were not necessarily the nicest folk, and a deserted house where  an unspeakable crime had been committed. As their boat pulls up to the little dock, our story begins.( oh, in real life the island is Key Biscayne, just down the road a piece from Tricky Dick Nixon's house.)Our chosen island is a creepy little place, made all the creepier by Uncle Alan who proceeds curdle his ""friends""/employees blood with graphic stories of the evils perpetrated by the dead buried in the ground around them, while they engage in the task of digging up a corpse of proper vintage for the evening's main event.Come midnight, however, Alan's ritual seems to be a dud and Orville (the recently exhumed corpse) just sits there like, well, like so much dead meat, as do all the other bodies in the cemetery. Incensed, Alan calls a curse down on Satan, which draws nothing but ridicule from his troupe and a classic case of one-upmanship from Valerie (Valerie Mamches).Humiliated and enraged, Alan orders them to drag Orville (Seth Sklarey) back to their camp at the spooky deserted caretaker's house where he proceeds to to demean, degrade, humiliate,and otherwise abuse both the living and the dead--while outside we see that the dead have decided to rise after all. Whether this is a result of Alan's ritual or a response to the curse called down on Satan is academic --the dead are rising. They are hungry. And ham is on the menu.From here on we are in classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD mode, board up the doors and windows and consult the handy dandy grimoire that Alan brought along to use in his original ritual. But oh no! To return all the zombies to their graves, they have to return Orville to his grave and they could never make it through all those slavering flesh eaters! What to do?Well, I'm not going to tell you. I haven't told you everything up til now either. What fun is review that makes you feel as if you've seen the movie? And this is one you should see for yourself if you dare call yourself a fan of the genre.Written and directed by Benjamin Clark (later to gain fame as Bob Clark with PORKY's BLACK CHRISTMAS and A CHRISTMAS STORY), CHILDREN is nicely written and rings true to anyone who has had to spend time with ""actors"" who are at this rung on the talent ladder) .Uncle Alan and his little troupe are constantly ""on"", always performing, always trying to come up with a funnier line than the last guy. Life for them is a constant audition. Its hippie theater with delusions of the avant garde, improv by the uninspired.There is some genuinely bad acting going on here and the finger is usually pointed at Alan Ormsby. I don't have a problem with him. I think he does what he has to do to get his charater across. For me its his real life Anya Ormsby who deserves the most criticism. Although her character of the fragile, spaced out, cleverly named Anya is all too familiar to those of us who inhabited that era---she just goes waaay too far. One character says ""one day she's just going to float away"", not likely, Anya has a jet pack.An awful lot is accomplished in this little movie with what can only be called a minuscule budget, I've heard it was $70,000. Alan Ormsby's make- up for instance is very effective, but why wouldn't it be...rumor has it he learned his craft working with Tom Savini, one of the greatest. And Carl Zittrer's musical score is extremely effective especially during the zombie resurrection scene, a scene always cited by fans as one of the scariest they've experienced. The electronic score combined with the shots of Ormsby's undead wriggling out of the earth like so many ghoulish seedlings seeking the sun in a perverted Disney nature film provides genuine chills and isn't easily forgotten. My daughter still gets freaked out by the music alone!There's more, so much more.

321226,A9UH6I9GVQZU2,6302574536,"Low-Ranking Reviewer ""tell it like it is""","[2, 3]","I saw this back in the 80's when i was a kid and recall not liking it.  It was waaay too talky, took forever to get going, and the zombie action was near the end.  But i recently got to watch it again when i bought a cheap horror collection that had this as one of the movies.  What was a talky, boring movie to me as a kid, turned out to be quite a good zombie flick as an adult.The most striking thing on my recent viewing is the dialogue and character interaction.  I guess as a kid i got bored with the talk and just wanted to see zombie guts.  But as i was rewatching this, i was surprised at how witty some of it was.  I was expecting to have to sit through lots of hippie talk or 70's lingo, but a lot of the dialogue sounds like it could've been written for today's audiences.  There's a lot of sarcasm, witty remarks, and dark humor to be found.  The lead character, who i found annoyingly talky as a kid, is now a hilariously pompous guy that really kept my interest throughout.  It's his ""i want to punch him in the face"" persona that made this movie for me.  Additionally, there's a character in the movie that basically makes tons of snide and sarcastic comments at his expense, which makes you feel as if you're in the movie yourself.  I think it's really cool that the movie revolves mainly around this guy and not the standard hero & heroine.Anyway, i was surprised how much i enjoyed watching the non-zombie part of the movie(which is most of it i'm afraid).  But when the zombies do show up, it's great to see how our main character handles it.  The zombie action/gore is minimal, but it's all nicely done and mostly worth the wait, more-so if you were able to connect with the group allowing you to have a more vested interest in their predicament.

321227,A1YHHM3QFKCBCK,6302574536,M2,"[2, 3]","The title, ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things,"" should be a tipoff to the sort of movie that is going to follow:  a creepy, ghoulish, genuinely disturbing horror film with a demented sense of humor.  Usually this kind of bizarre horror/comedy was the province of British filmmakers (see ""Horror Hospital""), but here the strangeness is home grown.  The plot concerns a thoroughly disfunctional theatrical troupe who are forced by their director (Alan Ormsby, in one of the worst performances ever captured on celuloid) to travel to a deserted island that houses an ancient graveyard, where he invokes demonic powers to raise the dead.  It all appears to be an elaborate, very sick joke...until it works.  This film was made for ten cents, and it shows, but somehow that doesn't hinder the effect.  The direction by Benjamin ""Bob"" Clark (later of ""Porky's"" and ""A Christmas Story"" fame) is quite good, and the script is filled with funny lines, if not the soundest character motivations.  Today's PC audiences may find offense in a couple camp characters, but even they are played for laughs and not malice.  Most of the acting is surprisingly good, too, given that the cast is very young and totally unknown (only Bruce Solomon went on to achieve any kind of prominence), and the living dead makeup, while a bit crude, is very effective.  The big, big weak spot is Ormsby, whose character not only has no redeeming characteristics, he has very few recognizably human ones.  The part requires an older actor who can toss off the Clifton Webb-ish acerbic lines and attitudes, while providing some kind of rationale for the character's seemingly insane behavior.  Instead we get someone who looks younger and more baby-faced than anyone else in the film, and who gives smirking recitations of his lines in an annoying nasal voice (to be fair to Ormsby, though, he also co-wrote the script and created the special makeup, much more successfully on both fronts). Even with that major flaw, though, there is enough entertainment value in ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" to make for a great, trashy evening of viewing.",4,Truly demented,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,2128,"['title', 'Children', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Play', 'Dead', 'Things', 'should', 'be', 'tipoff', 'sort', 'movie', 'going', 'follow', 'creepy', 'ghoulish', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'horror', 'film', 'demented', 'sense', 'humor', 'Usually', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'horror/comedy', 'was', 'province', 'British', 'filmmakers', 'see', 'Horror', 'Hospital', 'here', 'strangeness', 'home', 'grown', 'plot', 'thoroughly', 'disfunctional', 'theatrical', 'troupe', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'director', 'Alan', 'Ormsby', 'one', 'worst', 'performances', 'ever', 'captured', 'celuloid', 'travel', 'deserted', 'island', 'houses', 'ancient', 'graveyard', 'where', 'demonic', 'powers', 'raise', 'dead', 'be', 'elaborate', 'very', 'sick', 'joke', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'ten', 'cents', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'hinder', 'effect', 'direction', 'Benjamin', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'later', 'Porky', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'fame', 'quite', 'good', 'script', 'filled', 'funny', 'lines', 'not', 'soundest', 'character', 'motivations', 'Today', 'PC', 'audiences', 'may', 'find', 'offense', 'couple', 'camp', 'characters', 'even', 'are', 'played', 'laughs', 'not', 'malice', 'Most', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'too', 'given', 'cast', 'very', 'young', 'totally', 'unknown', 'only', 'Bruce', 'Solomon', 'went', 'achieve', 'kind', 'prominence', 'living', 'dead', 'makeup', 'bit', 'crude', 'very', 'effective', 'big', 'big', 'weak', 'spot', 'Ormsby', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'very', 'few', 'recognizably', 'human', 'ones', 'part', 'older', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'toss', 'off', 'Clifton', 'Webb-ish', 'acerbic', 'lines', 'attitudes', 'providing', 'kind', 'rationale', 'character', 'seemingly', 'insane', 'behavior', 'Instead', 'get', 'someone', 'who', 'younger', 'more', 'baby-faced', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'who', 'smirking', 'recitations', 'lines', 'annoying', 'nasal', 'voice', 'be', 'fair', 'Ormsby', 'though', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'created', 'special', 'makeup', 'much', 'more', 'successfully', 'fronts', 'Even', 'major', 'flaw', 'though', 'enough', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Children', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Play', 'Dead', 'Things', 'make', 'great', 'trashy', 'evening', 'viewing']",N/A

And then there are those nights where I know I don't have much time to unwind, because only a few hours stand between the present and being at work again.  So, I compromise with myself.  Out of my collection of DVDs, I have a select number that I toss in the DVD player and have no worry about being kept up late by trying to figure out the plot or a characters choices he makes in a film.  Not to say that ""Children"" puts me to sleep, but it's a familiarity to the film that puts me at ease.  I know the beginning, I know the middle and I know the end so well, that I don't need to sit up for another hour trying to figure out what happens at the end.  Sure, there are times I'll just pop it in to watch it, but, like I said, it's a familiarity to the film.Years ago, my dad, my brothers and I would spend Saturday afternoons watching Sir Graves Ghastly and the Thriller Double Feature.  My love for horror films was born during that time of my life.  And, of all the many horror films that I viewed on those Saturday afternoons, ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" has to be one of the films that I looked forward to seeing the most.Now, years later, I have my DVD collection (along with my VHS collection which I'll never give away), and ""Children"" has it's special place on my shelf, as it will always have a special place in my heart.Bob Clark introduces us to his venture into the horror genre as we see a boat manned by Alan (Alan Ormsby) and a group of his theatre actors (his Children), heading towards a small deserted island which just so happens to be the home to a large cemetery (gotta love the street lamps which light the island, too).  Children in tow, Alan takes the group to an abandoned house which just so happens to be the setting for another ""boarded-up-with-zombies-trying-to-break-in"" zombie film.  Alan has also brought along his box-o-tricks, his magical cloak, his book-o-spells...and baby's blood to sprinkle on the numerous graves on the island, in hopes that by making a pact with the devil, he'll be able to revive the dead to do his bidding.Yes, the story was a bit hokey, but it was the fun aspect of the film that pulled it along.  Not to mention the Special FX makeup, done by Mr. Ormsby himself (a man who worked alongside FX Maestro, Tom Savini), which add to the already creepy atmosphere.  I'd also like to add that ""Children"" had one of the MOST memorable zombie resurrection scenes EVER shot for the big screen...And, as a zombie conosieur, the dead rising in this film, just sends chills up my spine.  It's beautifulSo, with your not-so-beautiful cast, your AWESOME soundtrack score, your flesh peeling FX, all wrapped into one film about the living dead, I have to say that ""Children"" will always be on my top ten zombie film list.Thanks, Bob!",5,Classic B-Movie Zombie Flick,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,2930,"['long', 'day', 'work', 'like', 'come', 'home', 'unwind', 'bit', 'get', 'drink', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'good', 'flick', 'always', 'good', 'then', 'are', 'nights', 'where', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'unwind', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'stand', 'present', 'being', 'work', 'again', 'So', 'compromise', 'collection', 'DVDs', 'have', 'select', 'number', 'toss', 'DVD', 'player', 'have', 'worry', 'being', 'kept', 'up', 'late', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'plot', 'characters', 'choices', 'film', 'Not', 'say', 'Children', 'sleep', 'familiarity', 'film', 'ease', 'know', 'beginning', 'know', 'middle', 'know', 'end', 'so', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'sit', 'up', 'hour', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'end', 'Sure', 'are', 'times', ""'ll"", 'just', 'pop', 'watch', 'said', 'familiarity', 'film.Years', 'ago', 'dad', 'brothers', 'would', 'spend', 'Saturday', 'afternoons', 'watching', 'Sir', 'Graves', 'Ghastly', 'Thriller', 'Double', 'Feature', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'born', 'time', 'life', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'viewed', 'Saturday', 'afternoons', 'Children', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Play', 'Dead', 'Things', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'most.Now', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'VHS', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'never', 'give', 'away', 'Children', 'special', 'place', 'shelf', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart.Bob', 'Clark', 'venture', 'horror', 'genre', 'see', 'boat', 'manned', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'Ormsby', 'group', 'theatre', 'actors', 'Children', 'heading', 'small', 'deserted', 'island', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'home', 'large', 'cemetery', 'got', 'ta', 'street', 'lamps', 'light', 'island', 'too', 'Children', 'tow', 'Alan', 'group', 'abandoned', 'house', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'setting', 'boarded-up-with-zombies-trying-to-break-in', 'zombie', 'film', 'Alan', 'also', 'brought', 'along', 'box-o-tricks', 'magical', 'cloak', 'book-o-spells', 'baby', 'blood', 'sprinkle', 'numerous', 'graves', 'island', 'hopes', 'making', 'pact', 'devil', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'revive', 'dead', 'do', 'bidding.Yes', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'hokey', 'was', 'fun', 'aspect', 'film', 'pulled', 'along', 'Not', 'mention', 'Special', 'FX', 'makeup', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Ormsby', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'alongside', 'FX', 'Maestro', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'add', 'already', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'add', 'Children', 'had', 'one', 'MOST', 'memorable', 'zombie', 'resurrection', 'scenes', 'EVER', 'shot', 'big', 'screen', 'zombie', 'conosieur', 'dead', 'rising', 'film', 'just', 'chills', 'up', 'spine', 'beautifulSo', 'not-so-beautiful', 'cast', 'AWESOME', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'flesh', 'peeling', 'FX', 'wrapped', 'one', 'film', 'living', 'dead', 'have', 'say', 'Children', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'top', 'ten', 'zombie', 'film', 'list.Thanks', 'Bob']",N/A

I remembered clearly the one zombie with the sport-coat and tie and imposssibly big mustache climbing out of the grave, which gave me chills then..and still does.  Heck, I didn't remember this being a dark comedy back then, but it sure is.You can look at this movie in two different ways: one being it is a cheesey, low-budget, poorly done film.  Or 2:  A bunch of college kids, seriously inspired by George Romero, who took a shoe-string budget and  a lot of imagination and delivered a truly bizarre horror classic.Sure, the dialog is pathetic and the Ormsby is very annoying in the lead role..but that's how he's supposed to come off.  It's a 70's film and nothing more or nothing less.  It's fun to watch and , at times, scary along the way.The transfer of the film to dvd is just plain lousy.  I doubt if any big companies like Universal, Fox, or even Anchor Bay would buy this and digitally remaster it but, let's hope they do.This little gem of a movie is a classic and should get the respect it deserves.  The sound on the film is ok at best.  The video is horrendous: lots of drop-outs, many artifacts, and it looks like they got the worst possible film stock to transfer from.So, if you are a hard-core zombie fan..this one should not be missed.

Mr. Clark's directorial career is list of bad to terrible movies with the sole exception being the beloved holiday film classic- ""A Christmas Story"" which proves that a great cast and terrific script can overcome a hack director.""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" is one of the first of a long list of dreadful movies directed by Mr. Clark and it is proof that a bad cast and a rotten script can a make a hack director look even worse.  What we have here is a group of hippie actors, led by their flamboyently weird director, Alan, coming to a spooky island and taking up residence in a dilapidated house.  For most of the movie, the audience has to endure the campy antics of Alan as he bullies his cast and plays at being necromancer with the assistance of a book on the occult and a corpse.  However, things backfire on Alan as he really does resurrect the residents of a nearby cemetary.  This results in a counterculture version of ""Night of the Living Dead"" with the hippies attempting to fortify their house against a horde of hippie-hungry zombies.  As students of counterculture films of the early 70's are aware- hippies are completely ineffectual at defending themselves unless Tom Laughlin's ""Billy Jack"" is in the vicinity.  Unfortunately, for Alan and his gang- Billy Jack is nowhere to be seen in this one.

321238,ALLRNCQ2L8V9Z,6302574536,R. L. Matsui,"[4, 4]","First a COMPARISON of two of the more recent DVDs.  The 2007 release with the cover image of ""poor Jane Daly being grabbed by the Winns zombie"":  Transfer dark, dark, unwatchably dark.  The 2010 VCI release, with the ""the blue hand on the solid red background"" cover, is much better--same special features but a brighter transfer--some compression problems and a little fuzzy, but still the better transfer of the two, IMO.  Please choose carefully because there is a BIG difference between these two releases.Before we get into the review proper, let's give a bit of ackowledgement to the incredibly weird title of this film.  What a disturbing, weird title, huh?Okay, I saw this when I was a kid in the 70's. This is a zombie flick, a serious one.  But you have to wait for a while to get to the zombies and then...well, then it gets pretty scary.  It was a strange film for a kid to stay up and watch--it begins with about an hour of dialogue and creepy atmosphere, and no zombies.  And most of the talky humor was really beyond a tyke's comprehension, so kids tended to sit there for the first sixty minutes or so, scratching their chins, understanding only vaguely that the acting troupe performing satanic rituals on the ""burial island"" (or whatever it is), is doing something monstrously, horribly WRONG. What they're doing is worse than devil-worship, in a way, actually; they're being generally disrespectful in a kind of place (a cemetery) that demands respect as a first requirement. They're...asking for it.Why these people are so bizarre is anybody's guess. Why the crazed leader of the theatre group, Alan (Alan Ormsby), has chosen this place and these activities for a night of fun is never explored. These people all simply appear to be warped. And, in the tradition of E.C. comics, transgressors are not given a chance to learn the error of their ways and repent; however silly and young and ""sorry"" you may be, in this universe, if you do something that the spirits of the dead strongly dislike, you will be punished--as in, you will be ripped unceremoniously apart by ghouls, and devoured. While screaming. And then the ghouls will steal your boat.And the little kids watching this on late-night TV in the 70's seemed to understand this implicitly. It was not at all surprising what happened to this group of misguided transgressors. You may not have deeply understood the fine details of ""why."" But you knew SOMETHING TRULY AWFUL was going to happen to them, and that essentially, they deserved it. I remember when I watched it that before the film started, the station (Channel 9 out here in Los Angeles) would show scenes of the ""good stuff"" to get you jazzed, so, you knew some ""zombie consequences"" were coming down the pike. These people were seriously doomed. And for all its cheapness and crudity and cheesy performances, this is a very frightening and threatening flick, and no one who's seen it, I am willing to wager, has ever gone to a deserted cemetery to jokingly work weird rituals for the purpose of raising the dead. The rituals might actually work. And where would you be then?? Huh??? This is a feature length public service announcement to teach kids A.) not to work satanic rituals, because it's wrong, and B.) to always consider the feelings of other people, particularly dead people, because there are consequences to pissing people off--particularly dead people. As such, the film reenforced a lot of strong moral values, and did a lot of kids a lot of good, I feel.You see, the sudden and horrific emergence of the zombies during the last half hour is frightening in its intensity.  This movie had a very tiny micro-budget, so we do not see a big expensive production.  However, the filmmaking team was very enthusiastic about scaring the pants off the audience, and I think they did a very, very good job.  It's the stuff of nightmares.This is a casual, home-made horror film. The goopy red blood has a little bit of peanut butter in it to make it flow better and give it some opacity. The actors are probably wearing clothes from their personal wardrobes, and those hairstyles are theirs as well. It looks like some nice sets were built (nice considering the almost nonexistent budget of this piece), but the tone is almost that of a backyard Halloween show. The participants are having fun more than anything else--college kids playing with masks and dirt and sticky stuff, just barely aware that they're making a twisted 70's morality play. This is grim, upsetting material, and irredeemably wicked and bizarre, but really somehow very enjoyable.",5,A most shocking and excellent 70's horror film.,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,4594,"['First', 'COMPARISON', 'two', 'more', 'recent', 'DVDs', '2007', 'release', 'cover', 'image', 'poor', 'Jane', 'Daly', 'being', 'grabbed', 'Winns', 'zombie', 'Transfer', 'dark', 'dark', 'unwatchably', 'dark', '2010', 'VCI', 'release', 'blue', 'hand', 'solid', 'red', 'background', 'cover', 'much', 'better', 'same', 'special', 'features', 'brighter', 'transfer', 'compression', 'problems', 'little', 'fuzzy', 'still', 'better', 'transfer', 'two', 'IMO', 'Please', 'choose', 'carefully', 'BIG', 'difference', 'two', 'releases.Before', 'get', 'review', 'proper', 'let', 'give', 'bit', 'ackowledgement', 'incredibly', 'weird', 'title', 'film', 'What', 'disturbing', 'weird', 'title', 'huh', 'Okay', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'kid', '70', 'zombie', 'flick', 'serious', 'one', 'have', 'wait', 'while', 'get', 'zombies', 'then', 'well', 'then', 'pretty', 'scary', 'was', 'strange', 'film', 'kid', 'stay', 'up', 'watch', 'hour', 'dialogue', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'zombies', 'most', 'talky', 'humor', 'was', 'really', 'tyke', 'comprehension', 'so', 'kids', 'tended', 'sit', 'first', 'sixty', 'minutes', 'so', 'scratching', 'chins', 'understanding', 'only', 'vaguely', 'acting', 'troupe', 'performing', 'satanic', 'rituals', 'burial', 'island', 'whatever', 'doing', 'something', 'monstrously', 'horribly', 'WRONG', 'What', ""'re"", 'doing', 'worse', 'devil-worship', 'way', 'actually', ""'re"", 'being', 'generally', 'disrespectful', 'kind', 'place', 'cemetery', 'respect', 'first', 'requirement', ""'re"", 'asking', 'it.Why', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'bizarre', 'anybody', 'guess', 'Why', 'crazed', 'leader', 'theatre', 'group', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'Ormsby', 'chosen', 'place', 'activities', 'night', 'fun', 'never', 'explored', 'people', 'simply', 'appear', 'be', 'warped', 'tradition', 'E.C', 'comics', 'transgressors', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'chance', 'learn', 'error', 'ways', 'repent', 'however', 'silly', 'young', 'sorry', 'may', 'be', 'universe', 'do', 'something', 'spirits', 'dead', 'strongly', 'dislike', 'will', 'be', 'punished', 'will', 'be', 'ripped', 'unceremoniously', 'apart', 'ghouls', 'devoured', 'screaming', 'then', 'ghouls', 'will', 'steal', 'little', 'kids', 'watching', 'late-night', 'TV', '70', 'seemed', 'understand', 'implicitly', 'was', 'not', 'surprising', 'what', 'happened', 'group', 'misguided', 'transgressors', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'deeply', 'understood', 'fine', 'details', 'why', 'knew', 'SOMETHING', 'TRULY', 'AWFUL', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'essentially', 'deserved', 'remember', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'started', 'station', 'Channel', '9', 'here', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'would', 'show', 'scenes', 'good', 'stuff', 'get', 'jazzed', 'so', 'knew', 'zombie', 'consequences', 'were', 'coming', 'down', 'pike', 'people', 'were', 'seriously', 'doomed', 'cheapness', 'crudity', 'cheesy', 'performances', 'very', 'frightening', 'threatening', 'flick', 'one', 'who', 'seen', 'am', 'willing', 'wager', 'ever', 'gone', 'deserted', 'cemetery', 'jokingly', 'work', 'weird', 'rituals', 'purpose', 'raising', 'dead', 'rituals', 'might', 'actually', 'work', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'then', 'Huh', 'feature', 'length', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'teach', 'kids', 'A', 'not', 'work', 'satanic', 'rituals', 'wrong', 'B', 'always', 'consider', 'feelings', 'other', 'people', 'particularly', 'dead', 'people', 'are', 'consequences', 'pissing', 'people', 'off', 'particularly', 'dead', 'people', 'such', 'film', 'reenforced', 'lot', 'strong', 'moral', 'values', 'did', 'lot', 'kids', 'lot', 'good', 'feel.You', 'see', 'sudden', 'horrific', 'emergence', 'zombies', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'frightening', 'intensity', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'tiny', 'micro-budget', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'big', 'expensive', 'production', 'However', 'filmmaking', 'team', 'was', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'scaring', 'pants', 'audience', 'think', 'did', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'stuff', 'nightmares.This', 'casual', 'home-made', 'horror', 'film', 'goopy', 'red', 'blood', 'little', 'bit', 'peanut', 'butter', 'make', 'flow', 'better', 'give', 'opacity', 'actors', 'are', 'probably', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'personal', 'wardrobes', 'hairstyles', 'are', 'theirs', 'well', 'nice', 'sets', 'were', 'built', 'nice', 'considering', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'budget', 'piece', 'tone', 'almost', 'backyard', 'Halloween', 'show', 'participants', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'college', 'kids', 'playing', 'masks', 'dirt', 'sticky', 'stuff', 'just', 'barely', 'aware', ""'re"", 'making', 'twisted', '70', 'morality', 'play', 'grim', 'upsetting', 'material', 'irredeemably', 'wicked', 'bizarre', 'really', 'somehow', 'very', 'enjoyable']",N/A

The dialogue is very tongue-in-cheek, but it only adds to the movie's overall weirdness. The plot unfolds over one night, with a troupe of young actors robbing a grave, saying an incantaion to raise the dead, and then being attacked by zombies. It borrows heavily from Night Of The Living Dead, but somehow manages to make the material uniquely it's own. Ormsby, who plays the most sarcastic thespian, wrote My Bodyguard and is now a Hollywood script doctor. He and Clark last worked together, as far as I know, on the FX for the horror film Popcorn.For all fellow horror fans who have seen this movie dozens of times (God bless you all!), then this DVD is simply a must for the trailer.
