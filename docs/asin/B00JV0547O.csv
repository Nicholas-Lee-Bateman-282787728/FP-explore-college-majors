When he learns that his parents' murderer has been released from prison after serving a 20-year bid, he uses what little money he can muster to hunt down the ex-con responsible for destroying his life.Dwight Evans (Macon Blair) abandons his existence of relative peace in exchange for the chance to kill the man that killed his Mom and Dad. His child-like eyes are windows to his tortured mind, and are glazed with fear--not unlike a deer stuck in headlights. Quiet, contemplative, and dead-set on killing Wade Cleland, Jr., the man convicted of killing Dwight's parents. Macon's acting is top-notch for such a low-rent thriller.The supporting cast is passable, and is the film's weak spot. The other actors never rise above the cusp of mediocrity.

In this new age where technology is everywhere we turn and movies are at our disposal at all times, most companies have wised up and begun releasing films through platforms like Itunes, Vudu, and Video On Demand. One of the most recent flicks that caught my eye, already picking up steam at this year's Cannes Film Festival, is the riveting new revenge-thriller `Blue Ruin'.Starring newcomer Macon Blair, it follows a mysterious beach bum who's quiet life is quickly turned upside down by dreadful news. Setting off for his childhood home to carry out an act of vengeance, we see his emotional transformation as he winds up in a ruthless fight to protect his estranged family.Trust me, as vague as that plot description was, it's the way you should enter the film. With surprises and shocking moments at every corner, you will certainly be glad that it wasn't spoiled. Spellbinding from beginning to end, `Ruin' is unlike any other film you will see all year, and it may be the best. Blair delivers an astounding performance, inhabiting the character at all times, and never letting up for a second.Do yourself a favor and check this film out, you won't regret it.",5,Spellbinding!,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,1364,"['so', 'many', 'huge', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'already', 'being', 'released', 'preparation', 'summer', 'often', 'forget', 'more', 'tense', 'enthralling', 'stories', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'smaller', 'scale', 'new', 'age', 'where', 'technology', 'everywhere', 'turn', 'movies', 'are', 'disposal', 'times', 'most', 'companies', 'have', 'wised', 'up', 'begun', 'releasing', 'films', 'platforms', 'Itunes', 'Vudu', 'Video', 'Demand', 'One', 'most', 'recent', 'flicks', 'caught', 'eye', 'already', 'picking', 'up', 'steam', 'year', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'riveting', 'new', 'revenge-thriller', 'Blue', ""Ruin'.Starring"", 'newcomer', 'Macon', 'Blair', 'mysterious', 'beach', 'bum', 'who', 'quiet', 'life', 'quickly', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'dreadful', 'news', 'Setting', 'off', 'childhood', 'home', 'carry', 'out', 'act', 'vengeance', 'see', 'emotional', 'transformation', 'up', 'ruthless', 'fight', 'protect', 'estranged', 'family.Trust', 'as', 'vague', 'plot', 'description', 'was', 'way', 'should', 'enter', 'film', 'surprises', 'shocking', 'moments', 'corner', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'spoiled', 'Spellbinding', 'beginning', 'end', 'Ruin', 'other', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'year', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Blair', 'astounding', 'performance', 'inhabiting', 'character', 'times', 'never', 'letting', 'up', 'second.Do', 'favor', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Blue Ruin
1696932,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00JV0547O,C. Sawin,"[3, 6]","While the events in &#34;Blue Ruin&#34; are fairly unpredictable, you don't find yourself attached to any of the characters and don't have any investment over the consequences of anyone's actions in the film. Dwight's journey is filled with uncertainty and his mumbling ways are justified, but him saying so little and being so emotionally withdrawn only makes his character seem about as interesting as a dingy wash cloth.Dwight's encounter in the restroom near the beginning of the film is violently intense and similar to something straight out of &#34;No Country for Old Men.&#34; And while it's somewhat expected, there's a rather gruesome headshot in the second half of the film that pushes things in Dwight's favor when he needs it the most. Dwight's leg wound struggle is almost comedic at times in between the grisly moments when you feel yourself cringing harder than you have at anything released in theaters so far this year.The thriller has a gritty and grungy atmosphere that matches Dwight's disheveled physical appearance. It's something that the film fully embraces as this grimy world is still living and breathing during the very last frame. &#34;White trash&#34; seems too harsh of a phrase to describe it, but these are greasy individuals who are always down on their luck and living in the filthy underbelly of what would otherwise be considered &#34;scary&#34; neighborhoods.Much like Scott Cooper's &#34;Out of the Furnace,&#34; &#34;Blue Ruin&#34; has a lot of potential but fails to follow up on it. Jeremy Saulnier constructs a stimulating tale of revenge with beautiful cinematography, but the climax falls short of living up to the film's slow burn storytelling and regretfully none of the performances are very noteworthy. &#34;Blue Ruin&#34; is an extremely polished revenge thriller, but it's been buffed so much that it begins to dull in the areas that should be more striking.",3,A beautifully hollow thriller,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,1910,"['events', '34', 'Blue', 'Ruin', '34', 'are', 'fairly', 'unpredictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'attached', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'investment', 'consequences', 'anyone', 'actions', 'film', 'Dwight', 'journey', 'filled', 'uncertainty', 'mumbling', 'ways', 'are', 'justified', 'saying', 'so', 'little', 'being', 'so', 'emotionally', 'only', 'character', 'seem', 'as', 'interesting', 'dingy', 'wash', 'cloth.Dwight', 'encounter', 'restroom', 'beginning', 'film', 'violently', 'intense', 'similar', 'something', 'straight', '34', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men.', '34', 'somewhat', 'expected', 'rather', 'gruesome', 'headshot', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'things', 'Dwight', 'favor', 'when', 'most', 'Dwight', 'leg', 'wound', 'struggle', 'almost', 'comedic', 'times', 'grisly', 'moments', 'when', 'feel', 'cringing', 'harder', 'have', 'anything', 'released', 'theaters', 'so', 'far', 'year.The', 'thriller', 'gritty', 'grungy', 'atmosphere', 'matches', 'Dwight', 'disheveled', 'physical', 'appearance', 'something', 'film', 'fully', 'grimy', 'world', 'still', 'living', 'breathing', 'very', 'last', 'frame', '34', 'White', 'trash', '34', 'too', 'harsh', 'phrase', 'describe', 'are', 'greasy', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'down', 'luck', 'living', 'filthy', 'underbelly', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'considered', '34', 'scary', '34', 'neighborhoods.Much', 'Scott', 'Cooper', '34', 'Out', 'Furnace', '34', '34', 'Blue', 'Ruin', '34', 'lot', 'potential', 'follow', 'up', 'Jeremy', 'Saulnier', 'stimulating', 'tale', 'revenge', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'climax', 'short', 'living', 'up', 'film', 'slow', 'burn', 'storytelling', 'regretfully', 'none', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'noteworthy', '34', 'Blue', 'Ruin', '34', 'extremely', 'polished', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'been', 'buffed', 'so', 'much', 'dull', 'areas', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'striking']",Blue Ruin

1696934,AWH5ZZ8UXY1QJ,B00JV0547O,Decoratin4Fun!,"[1, 7]","Blue Ruin strains credibility pretty quickly.  It aspires to be a western without the wild wild west setting which can sustain lawless shootouts.  It ultimately comes off as bizarre and pretentious.  It lacks self awareness.  The story is that of a family feud: one family being a hickish backwoods type who kill the parents of a man in a more mainstream suburban family.  The reason for the killing?  Infidelity.  It isn't an act of passion either.  It is a premeditated murder condoned by the whole backwoods family.To the audience this weird caricature of 'country folk' will rub up against the film's contemporary realistic setting.  Films with this kind of milieu often have villainous families, but they illustrate them as psychopaths completely removed from society---like in horror films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), or as machiavellians with ulterior motives---like in the mob genre (The Sopranos, The Godfather).  In Blue Ruin the violence is merely presented as 'honor killing.'When asked why he doesn't go to the police, one character says, ""We're doing the same as you, keeping it in house.""  The problem is, the main character isn't seeking a private sense of justice.  He is resorting to it because the 'backwoods family's' killer was released from jail.  That is a credible motive for a killing---an act of revenge.  But the film turns this from a story of one man's revenge to a story about a family rivalry, it loses its 'logos.'The film wants us to believe this is a long standing Shakespearean family feud---the Montagues and the Capulets, but this is a contemporary setting, not ancient Europe.  It is like, 'lets have a shootout in the Walmart parking lot' kind of a head scratcher.  It is almost wistful and nostalgic in a Tea Party libertarian sense.  Oh wouldn't it be great if we all shot each other over petty interrelational squabbles?  No, that wouldn't make any sense.",2,Overhyped,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,1896,"['Blue', 'Ruin', 'credibility', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'be', 'western', 'wild', 'wild', 'west', 'setting', 'can', 'sustain', 'lawless', 'shootouts', 'ultimately', 'off', 'bizarre', 'pretentious', 'self', 'awareness', 'story', 'family', 'feud', 'one', 'family', 'being', 'hickish', 'backwoods', 'type', 'who', 'parents', 'man', 'more', 'mainstream', 'suburban', 'family', 'reason', 'killing', 'Infidelity', ""n't"", 'act', 'passion', 'premeditated', 'murder', 'condoned', 'whole', 'backwoods', 'family.To', 'audience', 'weird', 'caricature', ""'country"", 'folk', 'will', 'rub', 'up', 'film', 'contemporary', 'realistic', 'setting', 'Films', 'kind', 'milieu', 'often', 'have', 'villainous', 'families', 'illustrate', 'psychopaths', 'completely', 'removed', 'society', '-like', 'horror', 'films', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'machiavellians', 'ulterior', 'motives', '-like', 'mob', 'genre', 'Sopranos', 'Godfather', 'Blue', 'Ruin', 'violence', 'merely', 'presented', ""'honor"", 'killing', 'asked', 'why', ""n't"", 'go', 'police', 'one', 'character', ""'re"", 'doing', 'same', 'keeping', 'house', 'problem', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'seeking', 'private', 'sense', 'justice', 'resorting', ""'backwoods"", 'family', 'killer', 'was', 'released', 'jail', 'credible', 'motive', 'killing', '-an', 'act', 'revenge', 'film', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'revenge', 'story', 'family', 'rivalry', ""'logos"", 'film', 'believe', 'long', 'standing', 'Shakespearean', 'family', 'feud', '-the', 'Montagues', 'Capulets', 'contemporary', 'setting', 'not', 'ancient', 'Europe', ""'lets"", 'have', 'shootout', 'Walmart', 'parking', 'lot', 'kind', 'head', 'scratcher', 'almost', 'wistful', 'nostalgic', 'Tea', 'Party', 'libertarian', 'sense', 'Oh', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'shot', 'other', 'petty', 'interrelational', 'squabbles', 'No', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense']",Blue Ruin

He slips into empty homes during the day to bathe.  He searches the garbage for food.  When he learns a prisoner in Virginia will be freed in the near future, however, he becomes a man of purpose, a man of action.  He begins to drive.  He tries to steal a handgun.  The specific nature of the situation, what is driving our introverted hero toward an act of brutal vengeance, soon comes into focus in Blue Ruin, a dynamite, tightly wound independent suspense film.  Emphasis on &#34;suspense&#34; because this is truly a film charged with anxiety, despair, and menace.  Every scene pulsates with uncertainty and the threat of violence, intensified by the fact Dwight is both driven and out of his depth, so we are never sure how he will respond or even whether he will survive.  And the impact is considerable when violence does erupt.

Although the plots are totally different, its tone reminds me of BLOOD SIMPLE, the first movie from the Coen Brothers.Like that minor classic, which featured Frances McDormand in her first film role, BLUE RUIN has some possibly familiar faces from television in its cast, but no names.  Indeed, unknown leading man Macon Blair is the best friend of writer-director-cinematographer Jeremy Saulnier.Blair is not your typical hero of a revenge thriller.  He&#8217;s not an ex-C.I.A. operative or a Navy Seal.  He&#8217;s a homeless nerd; lost since his parents were murdered years ago.  Now, upon learning that the killer is about to be released from prison, he sets out to avenge his folks.  Unfortunately, his act sets off a chain reaction that pits one family against the other.Working with a bare bones budget, some of which was raised via Kickstarter,  Saulnier has fashioned a suspenseful, violent, surprise-filled and stunningly photographed film that grabs the audience&#8217;s attention from the outset and holds it for the ninety minute running time.  The superb, virtually unheard of cast includes Devin Ratray,  Amy Hargreaves and Eve Plumb.DVD extras for the Anchor Bay Entertainment Blu-ray release include audio commentary by Saulnier and Blair, deleted scenes and a &#8220;Making of&#8221; featurette that will certainly inspire young filmmakers hoping to make their own &#8220;no budget&#8221; movie.

1696948,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B00JV0547O,Robin Friedman,"[4, 4]","""Blue Ruin"", directed by Jeremy Saulnier, is a low-budget, award-winning thriller that develops Hatfield-McCoy related themes of revenge and violence.  Elliptical and spare, the film builds its tension throughout. The film features Saulnier's lifelong friend from the Washington, D.C. suburbs, Macon Blair, as the leading character, Dwight, who speaks relatively little during the film.  Blair captures his character with gestures, movement, dress, and his hauntingly expressive eyes.When the film opens, Dwight is homeless and leads the life of a beach bum while sleeping in his beat-up blue Bonneville. His life receives a bizarre form of purpose when he learns that the killer of his parents has been released from jail. Dwight's life suddenly becomes meaningful as he sets off to find and exact revenge on the killer. He has an intensity of purpose but little aptitude. He manages to kill his nemesis with a knife early in the film and then plunges into a feud to the death with the family of his victim, the Clelands. Dwight changes from a dirty, disheveled, bearded beach bum, to a clean-shaven, modestly dressed, and softly well-spoken would-be killer. The film includes a great deal of raw, painful violence, including a scene in which Dwight is struck by a cross-bow. Far from a polished killer, Dwight muddles through with many mistakes and errors in judgment.The film builds up a great deal of sympathy for Dwight and his quest while showing the futility and horror of revenge. His character, and his ineptitude for his chosen task, are developed throughout with emphasis on scenes between Dwight and his sister Kris and between Dwight and his loyal friend Ben who tries to teach Dwight to kill. The movie is set in the lower middle class areas of rural Virginia, with scenes of pawnshops, bars, abandoned railroad tracks, and amusement parks.  The sound track forms an integral part of the film, particularly an ironic song by Little Willie John celebrating the choices the singer has made in a hard life.A spare, taut and suspenseful noir-style film, ""Blue Ruin"" shows that talent and creativity can make something new from formulaic genres.Robin Friedman",5,Regeneration and Revenge in a New Thriller,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,2168,"['Blue', 'Ruin', 'directed', 'Jeremy', 'Saulnier', 'low-budget', 'award-winning', 'thriller', 'Hatfield-McCoy', 'related', 'themes', 'revenge', 'violence', 'Elliptical', 'spare', 'film', 'tension', 'film', 'Saulnier', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'suburbs', 'Macon', 'Blair', 'leading', 'character', 'Dwight', 'who', 'relatively', 'little', 'film', 'Blair', 'character', 'gestures', 'movement', 'dress', 'hauntingly', 'expressive', 'eyes.When', 'film', 'Dwight', 'homeless', 'life', 'beach', 'bum', 'sleeping', 'beat-up', 'blue', 'Bonneville', 'life', 'bizarre', 'form', 'purpose', 'when', 'killer', 'parents', 'been', 'released', 'jail', 'Dwight', 'life', 'suddenly', 'meaningful', 'find', 'exact', 'revenge', 'killer', 'intensity', 'purpose', 'little', 'aptitude', 'kill', 'nemesis', 'knife', 'early', 'film', 'then', 'feud', 'death', 'family', 'victim', 'Clelands', 'Dwight', 'changes', 'dirty', 'disheveled', 'bearded', 'beach', 'bum', 'clean-shaven', 'modestly', 'dressed', 'softly', 'well-spoken', 'would-be', 'killer', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'raw', 'painful', 'violence', 'including', 'scene', 'Dwight', 'struck', 'cross-bow', 'Far', 'polished', 'killer', 'Dwight', 'many', 'mistakes', 'errors', 'judgment.The', 'film', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'sympathy', 'Dwight', 'quest', 'showing', 'futility', 'horror', 'revenge', 'character', 'ineptitude', 'chosen', 'task', 'are', 'developed', 'emphasis', 'scenes', 'Dwight', 'sister', 'Kris', 'Dwight', 'loyal', 'friend', 'Ben', 'who', 'teach', 'Dwight', 'kill', 'movie', 'set', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'areas', 'rural', 'Virginia', 'scenes', 'pawnshops', 'bars', 'abandoned', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'amusement', 'parks', 'sound', 'track', 'forms', 'integral', 'part', 'film', 'particularly', 'ironic', 'song', 'Little', 'Willie', 'John', 'celebrating', 'choices', 'singer', 'made', 'hard', 'life.A', 'spare', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'noir-style', 'film', 'Blue', 'Ruin', 'talent', 'creativity', 'can', 'make', 'something', 'new', 'formulaic', 'genres.Robin', 'Friedman']",Blue Ruin
1696949,A3SGCDXCQ9O9WG,B00JV0547O,Spencer,"[0, 0]","The best movie I have seen so far this year.  I've always had a soft spot for the revenge film genre for there are a lot of great ones out there - Dead Man's Shoes, Unforgiven, In the Bedroom and Payback just to name a few.  However and with most revenge films - even good ones - they often lack the realism that makes such films so much more powerful.  Often the characters in such films become &#34;superheroes&#34; or like ex-Delta Force/Navy SEAL types when they where supposed to be just an every day Joe.Of the films I mentioned and one that's in my Top 10 favorites - Unforgiven - is one which it is most like and you can tell was most influenced by.  However, it makes it it's own by having the lead not come from a history of violence but one who driven to the edge by what violence has done to him.This film portrays revenge as real, sloppy, messy, never goes as planned and is often a lot more complicated than you ever we're led to believe or had yourself believe.What was interesting though was that there are a lot of dark, intense scenes that are interrupted by humor. Sometimes dark, sometimes just random, but subtle enough that you can either miss it nor is it distracting.  A very impressive feat and something I would compare to and maybe influenced by Tarantino who is one of the rare directors today that can pull this off.Some graphic violence, some touching scenes, well crafted characters and beautiful cinematography. Keeps you on your toes, keeps you engaged and a lot of foreboding that made it gripping at times.

1696955,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B00JV0547O,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[0, 0]","In retrospect it was a good idea to revisit Jeremy Saulnier's Blue Ruin after taking in Spike Lee's Oldboy remake and the mediocre Out of the Furnace. All would fall into the &#34;revenge thriller&#34; category, but there's very little about Blue Ruin that feels familiar. Instead it takes our concept of the revenge movie and uses that as a springboard to something new and unbearably tense, where the &#34;hero's&#34; journey for vengeance isn't something to be cheered on, but is instead something to be feared.The genius of Blue Ruin is that it doesn't simply grant us the &#34;wish fulfillment&#34; aspect inherent in every movie of this genre. That's the easy part; but what Saulnier does is thrust us headlong into the real-world repercussions such violence spawns. When we first meet Dwight (Macon Blair), he's a haggard shell of a man; skinny and ghostly, living out of his car like an aimless drifter. Something awful has clearly broken him; there's a sadness and terror behind his eyes that never goes away. While the locals obviously don't take kindly to him breaking into their homes to use the bath, the police are surprisingly forgiving; suggesting that whatever happened to Dwight was something truly heinous. We learn that his parents were murdered some time ago; setting him on the path of vagrancy he now seems mired in. But when he learns that the killer is about to be released from prison, all Dwight can think of is payback.From there the film goes everywhere one least expects it to, staying light enough on its feet to shift gears on a spinning dime. Dwight's quest for retribution ends rather early on, but neither he nor we are allowed long to celebrate this Pyrrhic victory. Instead that's where the story kicks into another direction entirely as Dwight comes to realize that violence only begets more violence, and revenge is a most cyclical beast. He's not a hardened killer or a tactician in any sense of the word; Dwight is an ordinary guy, and a fairly soft one at that. And when he screws up the implications could be terrible, not just for him but for the few people he remains close to. The true power of Blue Ruin is its ability to find tension in the little things, not showy acts of violence. Saulnier creates an ominous atmosphere that permeates your bones; the cinematography is simple and stark; and he even finds clever ways to inject humor (mainly through Dwight's war vet buddy played by Devin Ratray) without going overboard into full-blown comedy, which it easily could have.Although they say very different things about the nature of revenge and justice, Blue Ruin deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the original Oldboy.  In his sophomore feature, Saulnier has created a fierce, powder keg of a thriller that marks him as a filmmaker with an extremely bright future.",4,A Game Changer for the Revenge Movie Genre,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,2826,"['retrospect', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'revisit', 'Jeremy', 'Saulnier', 'Blue', 'Ruin', 'taking', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Oldboy', 'remake', 'mediocre', 'Out', 'Furnace', 'would', 'fall', '34', 'revenge', 'thriller', '34', 'category', 'very', 'little', 'Blue', 'Ruin', 'feels', 'familiar', 'Instead', 'concept', 'revenge', 'movie', 'springboard', 'something', 'new', 'unbearably', 'tense', 'where', '34', 'hero', '34', 'journey', 'vengeance', ""n't"", 'something', 'be', 'cheered', 'instead', 'something', 'be', 'feared.The', 'genius', 'Blue', 'Ruin', ""n't"", 'simply', 'grant', '34', 'wish', 'fulfillment', '34', 'aspect', 'inherent', 'movie', 'genre', 'easy', 'part', 'what', 'Saulnier', 'thrust', 'headlong', 'real-world', 'repercussions', 'such', 'violence', 'spawns', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Dwight', 'Macon', 'Blair', 'haggard', 'shell', 'man', 'skinny', 'ghostly', 'living', 'car', 'aimless', 'drifter', 'Something', 'awful', 'clearly', 'broken', 'sadness', 'terror', 'eyes', 'never', 'away', 'locals', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'kindly', 'breaking', 'homes', 'use', 'bath', 'police', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'forgiving', 'suggesting', 'happened', 'Dwight', 'was', 'something', 'truly', 'heinous', 'learn', 'parents', 'were', 'murdered', 'time', 'ago', 'setting', 'path', 'vagrancy', 'now', 'mired', 'when', 'killer', 'be', 'released', 'prison', 'Dwight', 'can', 'think', 'film', 'everywhere', 'one', 'least', 'staying', 'light', 'enough', 'feet', 'shift', 'gears', 'spinning', 'dime', 'Dwight', 'quest', 'retribution', 'rather', 'early', 'are', 'allowed', 'long', 'celebrate', 'Pyrrhic', 'victory', 'Instead', 'where', 'story', 'direction', 'entirely', 'Dwight', 'realize', 'violence', 'only', 'more', 'violence', 'revenge', 'most', 'cyclical', 'beast', 'not', 'hardened', 'killer', 'tactician', 'sense', 'word', 'Dwight', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'fairly', 'soft', 'one', 'when', 'up', 'implications', 'could', 'be', 'terrible', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'people', 'close', 'true', 'power', 'Blue', 'Ruin', 'ability', 'find', 'tension', 'little', 'things', 'not', 'showy', 'acts', 'violence', 'Saulnier', 'ominous', 'atmosphere', 'bones', 'cinematography', 'simple', 'stark', 'even', 'clever', 'ways', 'inject', 'humor', 'mainly', 'Dwight', 'war', 'vet', 'buddy', 'played', 'Devin', 'Ratray', 'going', 'overboard', 'full-blown', 'comedy', 'easily', 'could', 'have.Although', 'say', 'very', 'different', 'things', 'nature', 'revenge', 'justice', 'Blue', 'Ruin', 'be', 'mentioned', 'same', 'breath', 'original', 'Oldboy', 'sophomore', 'feature', 'Saulnier', 'created', 'fierce', 'powder', 'keg', 'thriller', 'filmmaker', 'extremely', 'bright', 'future']",Blue Ruin
