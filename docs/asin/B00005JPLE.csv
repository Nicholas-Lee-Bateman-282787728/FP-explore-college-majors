I was surprised at how very sad this movie could get and suffice it to say that I cried during parts. The movie does get more uplifting at the end, but its not all smiles.This movie has a good concept, Charlie Farmer building his own space rocket to fulfill his dreams, but the writing just seemed off somehow. I didn't think that the characters handled family conflict or serious money problems realistically. All the actors do a good job performing their roles; I just think the roles themselves are off.I also thought that this movie would be about the actual building of the rocket, Charlie Farmer explaining his dream to his family, etc. The movie actually starts with the rocket mostly finished and Charlie Farmer looking for rocket fuel. The FBI and other government agencies step in because it is rather suspicious for a civilian to be buying thousands of pounds of rocket fuel, and try to stop the already made rocket from launching.MAJOR CONFLICTSGovernment vs. Charlie FarmerTowns Perception (Small Town) vs. Charlie FarmerMoney Problems / Bank vs. Charlie FarmerFamily Problems / Mrs. Farmer vs. Charlie FarmerMAIN MORALSThe importance of holding on to your dreamsThe value of family love and supportThe importance of ignoring those who ridicule you while you pursue dream.I would like to give this movie 3.5 stars.

652352,A1A4R6PU3QYVJ5,B00005JPLE,"Amazon Customer ""Serious Reader""","[1, 1]","Some time ago, the team at Spacecraft Films put together the fine anthologyLiftoff! Success and Failure on the Launch Pad.  This anthology shows a number of missile mishaps that earned Cape Canaveral nicknames like ""Malfunction Junction"" and ""Cape Carnival"" back in the 1950s and 1960s.  One such disaster featured in this DVD set occurs when during a static test-firing of an Atlas-Able rocket.  After a mechanical problem causes the engines of the Atlas booster to shut down, the booster catches fire.  Moments later, the thin-skinned booster falls over and explodes with such force that it destroys the launch pad and the umbilical tower beside it.Atlas, of course, was a first-generation liquid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missile, in active service with the US Air Force from 1963 to 1965.  But even before this missile was used as a weapon of war, it was used to propel John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, Walter Schirra and Gordon Cooper into orbit during Project Mercury.  That Atlas performed well during Mercury was a miracle given the missile's mercurial history of spectacular failures on the pad and in the sky.  Which means that when the Atlas missile that Billy Bob Thornton has built to propel him into space falls over onto its side during his first launch attempt, there shouldn't have been any second attempt.  In fact, there shouldn't have been anything within a couple thousand feet of the rocket after it fell over, including Billy Bob Thornton, his wife (played by Virginia Madsen), his farm, or his kids.  End of movie, right?  Well, no.  In fact, Thornton survives a wild horizontal ride to build a new Atlas and finally get himself into orbit, fulfilling a dream that he has risked life, limb, property, and family to achieve.""The Astronaut Farmer"" depicts a man chasing a dream and overcoming impossible odds to fulfill it.  If you can overlook the obvious techincal problems of building an Atlas, which was so thin-skinned it required pressurization in order to maintain its shape, and then launching it, you'll have a good time.  Otherwise, if you know anything about the American space program and/or the Atlas missile in specific, prepare to launch your own insults at the screen as you watch.  This movie, thankfully, isn't terrible.  But it certainly makes you shake your head.",2,"As long as you suspend belief, not a bad movie.",1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,2309,"['time', 'ago', 'team', 'Spacecraft', 'Films', 'put', 'together', 'fine', 'anthologyLiftoff', 'Success', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'Pad', 'anthology', 'number', 'missile', 'mishaps', 'earned', 'Cape', 'Canaveral', 'nicknames', 'Malfunction', 'Junction', 'Cape', 'Carnival', 'back', '1950s', '1960s', 'One', 'such', 'disaster', 'featured', 'DVD', 'set', 'when', 'static', 'test-firing', 'Atlas-Able', 'rocket', 'mechanical', 'problem', 'engines', 'Atlas', 'booster', 'shut', 'down', 'booster', 'catches', 'fire', 'Moments', 'later', 'thin-skinned', 'booster', 'explodes', 'such', 'force', 'launch', 'pad', 'umbilical', 'tower', 'it.Atlas', 'course', 'was', 'first-generation', 'liquid-fueled', 'intercontinental', 'ballistic', 'missile', 'active', 'service', 'US', 'Air', 'Force', '1963', '1965', 'even', 'missile', 'was', 'used', 'weapon', 'war', 'was', 'used', 'propel', 'John', 'Glenn', 'Scott', 'Carpenter', 'Walter', 'Schirra', 'Gordon', 'Cooper', 'orbit', 'Project', 'Mercury', 'Atlas', 'performed', 'well', 'Mercury', 'was', 'miracle', 'given', 'missile', 'mercurial', 'history', 'spectacular', 'failures', 'pad', 'sky', 'Which', 'when', 'Atlas', 'missile', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'built', 'propel', 'space', 'side', 'first', 'launch', 'attempt', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'second', 'attempt', 'fact', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'couple', 'thousand', 'feet', 'rocket', 'fell', 'over', 'including', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'wife', 'played', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'farm', 'kids', 'End', 'movie', 'right', 'Well', 'fact', 'Thornton', 'wild', 'horizontal', 'ride', 'build', 'new', 'Atlas', 'finally', 'get', 'orbit', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'risked', 'life', 'limb', 'property', 'family', 'achieve', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'man', 'chasing', 'dream', 'overcoming', 'impossible', 'odds', 'fulfill', 'can', 'overlook', 'obvious', 'techincal', 'problems', 'building', 'Atlas', 'was', 'so', 'thin-skinned', 'required', 'pressurization', 'order', 'maintain', 'shape', 'then', 'launching', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Otherwise', 'know', 'anything', 'American', 'space', 'program', 'Atlas', 'missile', 'specific', 'prepare', 'launch', 'own', 'insults', 'screen', 'watch', 'movie', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'certainly', 'shake', 'head']",N/A

The premieres we seen from the commercials painted the entire picture.  A father wants to create a rocket to launch him into outer space, and along the way, he has to deal with the FBI and more than his fair share of major disappointments preventing his dream from coming true.I think the movie had its share of hits and misses (though nothing TOO uneventful thankfully).  I mean, the character build up in the beginning (the segments where we get to know all the main characters) was very boring, but then, once the father got the urge to build his dream rocket and wanted his family to be included in the project (especially his son), the story really began to pick up.I didn't really like the ending though.  I won't say what happens at the end, but it just ends, and that's it.  Wasn't too impressed with that.  I was also disappointed they used the very predictable Elton John classic ""Rocket Man"" for the ending credits theme.  Come on now, that's just too obvious of a choice (as great as the song is).What made the movie so great was how many times the father was convinced he was gonna give up completely building the rocket, only for something to come along and change his mind.

Those words echoed by Martin Luther King and the multitude of followers have since become a mantra for many. And there's nothing wrong with having a dream. Following it, though, can lead to problems. Especially if that dream is expensive, dangerous, maybe a bit psychotic, and possibly illegal ...or all four.When a man named Charles Farmer (Billy Bob Thornton,The Ice Harvest) from Texas wants to blast a space rocket out of his barn and into orbit, one might think ""cool idea."" But how far can one man's dream go before it becomes a damaging obsession? Damaging to his life, his family's life, and maybe even the nation.Charles' family shares his dream, a kind of mass psychosis, about launching a private rocket (with Dad at the controls) into outer space. His wife Audie (Virginia Madsen,Sideways) supports him undyingly but has her doubts about him ever launching the rocket. His eldest son Shepard (Max Thieriot) will be his mission control, and his two young daughters Stanley (Jasper Polish) and Sunshine (Logan Polish) worship their father's dream in an almost biblical sense. But when foreclosures, FAA regulations, and the wavering support of his town develop, Charles must take drastic measures. Nearly killing himself with his first attempt, Charles' dream of spaceflight fades and with it the man and all those around him. His wife realizes what must be done, for without the dream her husband no longer exists.Being a HUGE Polish brothers fan (Northforkis one of my all-time favorite films), I expected much from identical twins Mark and Michael, but they sadly disappointed me with THE ASTRONAUT FARMER. Plot and story are rapidly slashed in order to keep the movie moving forward, giving the entire film an unrealistic feel. There's no hallelujah moment (although the film would have you believe there is) simply because there's no way the watcher could get behind the characters and care about them with a story that didn't allow you to get and remain close to them.This is the Polish brothers' most mainstream Hollywood film to date, with well-known actors and actresses at the top of their game (Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, Tim Blake Nelson, etc.) but Hollywood cookie-cutter cutout film making doesn't seem to jive with Michael and Mark Polish's style. Their previous movies (Northfork,Jackpot,Twin Falls Idaho) have focused specifically on the minutiae of characters and events, giving their films a surrealistic feel. The Astronaut Farmer is more direct and thus loses much that has made the Polish boys an underground success.I'm hoping that the brothers get back to what they do well; that is, making movies that extend beyond the mainstream. Although I could see a few Polish brothers details in The Astronaut Farmer (specifically the names of characters which are paramount to the story ...Shepard, Farmer, Sunshine, etc.), there were too many other problems that destroyed this unfortunate film.",2,The Polish Brothers Shouldn't Do Mainstream Hollywood Films,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,2939,"['have', 'dream', 'words', 'echoed', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'multitude', 'followers', 'have', 'become', 'mantra', 'many', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'having', 'dream', 'Following', 'though', 'can', 'lead', 'problems', 'Especially', 'dream', 'expensive', 'dangerous', 'maybe', 'bit', 'psychotic', 'possibly', 'illegal', 'four.When', 'man', 'named', 'Charles', 'Farmer', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Ice', 'Harvest', 'Texas', 'blast', 'space', 'rocket', 'barn', 'orbit', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'cool', 'idea', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'one', 'man', 'dream', 'go', 'damaging', 'obsession', 'Damaging', 'life', 'family', 'life', 'maybe', 'even', 'nation.Charles', 'family', 'shares', 'dream', 'kind', 'mass', 'psychosis', 'launching', 'private', 'rocket', 'Dad', 'controls', 'outer', 'space', 'wife', 'Audie', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Sideways', 'undyingly', 'doubts', 'ever', 'launching', 'rocket', 'eldest', 'son', 'Shepard', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'will', 'be', 'mission', 'control', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Stanley', 'Jasper', 'Polish', 'Sunshine', 'Logan', 'Polish', 'worship', 'father', 'dream', 'almost', 'biblical', 'sense', 'when', 'foreclosures', 'FAA', 'regulations', 'wavering', 'support', 'town', 'develop', 'Charles', 'must', 'take', 'drastic', 'measures', 'Nearly', 'killing', 'first', 'attempt', 'Charles', 'dream', 'spaceflight', 'fades', 'man', 'wife', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'dream', 'husband', 'no', 'longer', 'exists.Being', 'HUGE', 'Polish', 'brothers', 'fan', 'Northforkis', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'films', 'expected', 'much', 'identical', 'twins', 'Mark', 'Michael', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'THE', 'ASTRONAUT', 'FARMER', 'Plot', 'story', 'are', 'rapidly', 'slashed', 'order', 'keep', 'movie', 'moving', 'forward', 'giving', 'entire', 'film', 'unrealistic', 'feel', 'hallelujah', 'moment', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'simply', 'way', 'watcher', 'could', 'get', 'characters', 'care', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'remain', 'close', 'them.This', 'Polish', 'brothers', 'most', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'date', 'well-known', 'actors', 'actresses', 'top', 'game', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'etc', 'Hollywood', 'cookie-cutter', 'cutout', 'film', 'making', ""n't"", 'seem', 'jive', 'Michael', 'Mark', 'Polish', 'style', 'previous', 'movies', 'Northfork', 'Jackpot', 'Twin', 'Falls', 'Idaho', 'have', 'focused', 'specifically', 'minutiae', 'characters', 'events', 'giving', 'films', 'surrealistic', 'feel', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'more', 'direct', 'thus', 'much', 'made', 'Polish', 'boys', 'underground', 'success.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'brothers', 'get', 'back', 'what', 'do', 'well', 'making', 'movies', 'extend', 'mainstream', 'could', 'see', 'few', 'Polish', 'brothers', 'details', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'specifically', 'names', 'characters', 'are', 'paramount', 'story', 'Shepard', 'Farmer', 'Sunshine', 'etc', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'problems', 'destroyed', 'unfortunate', 'film']",N/A

Although it did sound very far fetched that someone (Billy Bob Thorton as Charlie Farmer) can build a rocket and fly it on their own to outer space, the idea of putting in the effort is what counts. To actually build a rocket like that on your own in real life would be a total logistical and financial nightmare. Like in the movie the federal government would suspect you are building a WMD and tear down your project!The funniest part of the film is where Charlie Farmer throws a brick through his friend's (the bank loan officer's) window, when the loan officer turns down his request for funding. He is forced to formally apologize to him later at the police station. This movie is an uplifting, but also funny movie. I am saddened that so many people gave this movie negative reviews based on the far fetched nature of the plot.

During one particularly frustrating moment in THE ASTRONAUT FARMER, Billy Bob's character (appropriately named Charlie Farmer) laments that when he was a child, he was told (as all children in America are told) that he could be anything--or do anything--he dared to dream about.  Only. . .that's not the case.  Today, if one dares to explore space as a private citizen, one will draw the ire of the FAA, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the scorn and ridicule of everyone else.  In other words, we as a society have successfully limited ourselves by obstacles of political correctness, and this film is a marvelous metaphor shouting this incontrovertible from the dusty Texas plains.Charlie Farmer dares to dream, and in the course of fulfilling that dream almost loses his family--and everything he owns.  Charlie becomes a pariah, some sort of vagabond anomaly--even to his own wife (Virginia Madsen is a handsome lass)--yet the dream prevails.  And despite the nutty, laugh-out-loud zaniness as Charlie builds his rocket ship (who knew you could find a used Gemini capsule at the old Five & Dime?), we marvel at the persistence of Charlie and his dream. . .a persistence that is finally rewarded in a feel-good ending.Billy Bob Thornton is very likable; Virginia Madsen looks good; Bruce Dern is strangely subdued; Bruce Willis makes a brief cameo and has a beer.

I was infected as a first grader as I watched Alan Shepard innaugurate the U.S. manned space program; I was never cured of, or outgrew, that infection. So, if only in a cursory way, I do know a little about building a rocket, about orbital mechanics, about the difficulty of re-entry and about landing back on planet Earth in one piece. Still, I'll give ""The Astronaut Farmer"" the benefit of the doubt and call it just silly instead of stupid.The production is solidly in the made-for-TV genre of the 1970s, although many of those low-budget rush jobs were better. Directed by Michael Polish, who co-wrote the script with brother Mark, the plot is full of holes smeared over with smarmy muisc. The most basic details were too much trouble to figure out, script-wise, and so simply aren't part of the story. We see nothing of planning the rocket, finding parts and actually building the rocket, which in any even halfway serious take on such a fantastic story would have been a good chunk of the drama. No, as the movie opens the gleaming rocket sits in Charles Farmer's barn, awaiting only fuel.Farmer is months behind on a bank loan for his ranch. When Farmer's wife's credit card is denied at the grocery we know he's robbing Peter to pay Paul, a cue that in no way remotely approaches the many, many hundreds of thousands of dollars (at the very least) a bare bones sub-orbital DIY rocket would cost. The orbital mission Farmer is grasping would cost millions. And guess what? When a fully loaded multi-staged rocket ends up horizontal it explodes, destroying and killing everything within hundreds of feet. It doesn't go skimming intact across the prairie like the Acme rocket the coyote would use to pursue the roadrunner. (This inane sequence is complete with - and to quote Dave Barry, I swear I'm not making this up - flying squarely through a billboard. Ain't that a rocket man hoot?)If this movie had been called ""The Astronaut Pee Wee Herman,"" fine. No problems. And I understand the main focus was on one man's goal (whatever it might be), and the connotations of genuine living when one has a true, unshakable dream - a focus that sometimes excuses streamlining devices. But as many movies have shown, from ""October Sky"" to ""Akeelah and the Bee"" (heck, for that matter even the deliberately silly ""Galaxy Quest""), working out the details, finding the ones that count and connecting them logically brings the true human struggle into the ninety-minute or two-hour window available to tell a story.Billy Bob Thornton is toothy and folksy as Charles farmer, just brimming with aw-shucks-itude. One reviewer praised Thornton for turning in a ""surprisingly low-key and grounded performance."" OK. Except BBT is not about low key. And even his less manic characters have never been grounded. He's about ""Sling Blade"" and ""Bad Santa."" Kevin Cline is about low key.The beginning of the U.S. space program was almost fifty years ago. Few people today understand or appreciate what the United States accomplished in the eight short years from April of 1961 to July of 1969. The real problem I have with ""The Astronaut Farmer"" is that it suggests that those early years weren't such a big deal.

(alright, at one point he is diagnosed as clinically insane, but let's not quibble.)  as if that were not implausible enough, he's a southerner -- indeed, a *Texan!*  (had he been, say, a working class Italian American with no connection, of any sort, to the Mob, it would have pushed the envelope of credulity beyond the tearing point.)the first question one might ask would be:  how could such a project ever get financed in the first place?  aside from a nutcase such as Mel Gibson, who would risk capital on such an implausible premise?  as it turns out, this indie project is, in part, a vehicle for two child actors, Jasper and Logan Polish, who are daughters of this film's writers, producers, directors Mark and Michael Polish (additionally, Mark plays an FBI agent on screen).  i guess there's nothing like putting your own daughters in your film to motivate an 'unorthodox' perspective on fatherhood.perhaps what made this otherwise impossible premise acceptable by Hollywood PC standards were two (otherwise completely gratuitous) auto-de-fe's by the father (Billy Bob Thornton, who is actually from Arkansas, not Texas -- but let's not get carried away).  in the first, he speechifies to a committee of officious Washington bureaucrats who wickedly want to stop a private citizen from launching a manned Atlas rocket from his backyard, words to the effect, ~if another country tried to land men on the moon, the US would probably declare war on them~.  (the last i read, Japan and China have such ambitions; but, so far, there are no plans for war with either country on Dick Cheney's desk.  [come to think of it, cross your fingers.])in the other genuflection to the Hollywood Left, Thornton, responding to a rumor that violent force will be used by the US government to prevent his launch, says something like, ~they're pretty good at killing people with dreams.~  (conspiracy theories, anyone?)the ever-radiant Virginia Madsen (why hasn't her career been at least as big as, for example, Jessica Lange's?) plays Thornton's wife, who stands by her man.

652376,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JPLE,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","THE ASTRONAUT FARMER is a sound little film with a warm message about living for your dreams. The best part about this film is its honesty in not pushing the limits to make a point. It does require the audience to release a bit of credibility, but stories that are fables are pretty rare in film these days and that is reason enough to enter this one. Twin brothers Michael and Mark Polish ('Northfork', 'Twin Falls Idaho', 'Jackpot') wrote and directed this work and have a style that begs indulgence on the part of the viewer, but the style is unique and consistent and is proving to be a fascinating source of art house movie making.Charles Farmer (Billy Bob Thornton) is a retired military man who trained as an astronaut but retired to save his family farm in Texas. He dreams of a life as an astronaut and with the encouragement of his wife Audie (Virginia Madsen), grandfather Hal (Bruce Dern), son Shepard (Max Thieriot) and other children, Farmer has built a rocket and a space ship, going against all odds to be the first citizen astronaut. Though many of the little town's citizens question Farmer's credibility and though the bank threatens to foreclose on his over-borrowed farm, Farmer persists - his only major problem occurs when he orders 10,000 gallons of fuel, a factor that alerts the FBI. But Farmer manages to remain focused to achieve his dream and the ending of the movie reveals the payoff to his persistence.The cast is excellent with Thornton giving one of his more docile roles and succeeding in making Farmer win our hearts. Minor roles make use of the talents of Tim Blake Nelson, J.K. Simmons, Sal Lopez and Kiersten Warren among others. The pleasure of this fantasy film is the lack of need for computer-generated animation: the magic is in the warmth of the characters and their dreams. This is a fine little film for a large, sensitive audience.

He moves right-to-left, which spells trouble in movies' silent language. There, he finds a calf that has strayed from its mother, lying in the sand. With a firm but gentle hand, he returns the lost beast to the herd.It's a scene whose incongruous visual elements reminded me of the 1968 sci-fi thriller Planet of the Apes. But this isn't some spaceman marooned in a strange place; it's the movie's earthbound hero, a Texan named Charles Farmer (Billy Bob Thornton). A graduate of the University of Texas aerospace engineering program and one-time member of NASA's astronaut program, Charlie left the space agency decades ago to run the family ranch after his father's untimely death. Yet, through all the years of operating the ranch and raising his own family, he hasn't let go of his dream of defying gravity.In his barn, Charlie works obsessively, day and night, to build a rocket that may help him realize his dream. He models it after 1950s-era Atlas missiles, using salvage parts he buys on the cheap from rocket graveyards. His supportive wife, Audie (Virginia Madsen, enjoying a rewarding second wind onscreen), and their three kids get caught up in the daily up-and-down drama of his quest; indeed, his first-born, son Shepard (Max Thieriot), was named in honor of the first American in space, Alan Shepard.However, their neighbors in the farm community regard Charlie as the town oddball, a frustrated man going through a bizarre mid-life crisis. There's even an ongoing bet among the locals as to whether he ""will ever go up, or blow up."" When he attends show-and-tell at his daughter's elementary school in his spacesuit, her teacher humors him: to spur the kids' imaginations, ""we need more parents willing to dress up."" Foremost among Charlie's woes: to finance his idea, he's gone into hock for over a half-million dollars to the local bank, and they're about to foreclose on his ranch for delinquent payments.What I like about Thornton's portrayal is that it actually justifies the townsfolk in pigeonholing him as a square peg. A quixotic figure with a bit of a mean streak (when he receives a foreclosure letter, he throws a brick through the banker's plate-glass window), he reminds me a little of Anthony Hopkins's quirky Burt Munro in The World's Fastest Indian. But, when push comes to shove, Thornton recalls Burt Lancaster in so many of his tough-guy Western roles.When Charlie forwards his flight plan to the FAA in anticipation of his expected launch, government officials dismiss him as a crank. But when he attempts to purchase high-grade liquid rocket fuel, he opens a can of alphabet soup: the FBI, CIA, FAA, NASA, and a host of other agencies descend upon his ranch to stop him. Even the local Child Protective Services closes in when Charlie decides to home-school his kids and draft them into his ""space program."" In typical bureaucratic fashion, the CPS agent diagnoses the children, long-distance, as ""brainwashed and violated,"" and threatens his wife: ""It's about time you take charge of your family before someone else does it for you.""A visit to his lawyer makes Charlie more aware of the pressure the government intends to apply. ""With the Patriot Act,"" the attorney tells him, ""they can do whatever they want if they think it's a threat to homeland security."" He advises Charlie to ""embrace the media, invite them in for your protection."" Next, an astronaut from the old days (Bruce Willis, in an uncredited role) shows up to try to talk his eccentric friend out of his scheme. ""They don't let civilians into outer space, they let astronauts into outer space,"" he says. We then learn that he's been sent at NASA's behest, because if successful, Charlie's shoestring-budget launch could embarrass the space agency, which needs to defend its multi-billion-dollar budgets.Eventually, Charlie defends himself before a meeting of federal officials in words that express the aspirations of the lone creator against the regulatory state and the pessimistic mindset:It's not your right to tell me whether or not I can launch into space.... I know we have laws; we've got all kind of laws. We've got more laws that tell us what we can't do than anything else.... You see, when I was a kid they used to tell me that I could be anything I wanted to be. No matter what. And, maybe I am insane, I don't know, but I still believe that. I believe with all my heart. Somewhere along the line, we stopped believing that we could do anything, and if we don't have our dreams, we have nothing.Soon after, in a fit of desperation, he launches his rocket, using an unstable kerosene-based fuel mix. It leads to disastrous consequences, but...Well, I don't want to give away the ending. Let's just say that The Astronaut Farmer isn't just a ""feel-good movie""; it's a preposterously ""feel-good movie."" Its plot has to be taken with a grain of salt, but then, so does movie popcorn. I don't go to the movies to bask in the mundane or to nitpick at continuity errors; I go to be entertained, perhaps even enlightened. And the Polish brothers tell a highly entertaining and sometimes thought-provoking tall tale.In a way, I found The Astronaut Farmer almost as predictable as Pan's Labyrinth, also reviewed in this issue. However, it's one of those unbelievable flicks that you can truly believe in, because its creators take the preposterous seriously. That, and an expertly suspenseful buildup, makes all the difference. Somehow, they were able to take the plot of the forgotten Andy Griffith 1979 TV movie Salvage One, seize the theme of Francis Ford Coppola's Tucker: The Man and His Dream, mix in cinematic references to John Ford Westerns and Apollo 13,and yet make it all jell. The movie's only real drawback is an undistinguished soundtrack.Credible acting enhances the story's credibility. Billy Bob Thornton brings to the role of Charlie his quiet, idiosyncratic, yet steadfast demeanor. For her part, Virginia Madsen exudes a natural warmth and unflagging conviction. The supporting actors are well-cast, too, including sisters Jasper and Logan Polish as Charlie and Audie's daughters; Bruce Dern as Audie's cantankerous, aging father; and J.K. Simmons as the gruff FAA official who keeps setting up bureaucratic roadblocks in Charlie's path.What I most enjoyed, however, is that The Astronaut Farmer is a great family movie, as entertaining for the kids as it is for their parents. One of my earliest childhood memories is from late one night in July 1969, when I was four years old. My father woke me up and took me to the living room television set to watch Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. Lately, I've been thinking that perhaps I'll never get to share a moment like that with my own son, who will soon turn two--that in his lifetime, man may never again set foot on the moon, let alone walk on Mars.After watching Billy Bob Thornton's unwavering, ""can-do"" performance for almost two hours, however, those dim prospects somehow seem to grow a little brighter.",4,Barn

652381,A2K4HN6EECBNR3,B00005JPLE,"Jean Baldridge  Yates ""jean, jewelry designer...","[1, 4]","""The Astronaut Farmer"" stars Billy Bob Thornton. This is the sort of movie which is ""sort of"", ""kind of"" watchable, from bed or wherever your favorite DVD comfort spot is. However, it is pretty slow going...posible need? Some serious editing.It is about a man named Farmer (get it? And he's an astronaut?) who used to be in training at NASA, but he had to leave and go home to save his family from losing their farm when his father dies. So he loses his opportunity to go into space. However, he hangs onto the dream, and decides to build his OWN rocket in his backyard.As Judy Tenuta always says, ""Like this could haaaaapen!""Billy Bob's movie family are loyal and true, except for the occasional tantrum from his wife when they run out of food. I hate when my husband is a failed astronaut and we run out of food, too. Of course the family are all adorable looking and look like they all came out of a children's clothing catalog. They frequently run around with wildflowers filling their arms. I don't know what it is that they farm. Possibly I was dozing off at that point. Or maybe they actually FARM wildflowers.Billy Bob stares into space, a lot. He does some serious emoting in this movie. It's pretty heavy, being him.It has a Don Quixote aspect to it, which is poignant. Therefore, watch out: because...You might not want anyone to see you crying when this movie gets sappy. And sappy it gets. I cried several times. Or let's just say this: I got ""dust in my eyes "" several times, and snuffled quietly from ""a sudden hay fever attack"".Let's also say this movie is ridiculously improbable. If it is a true story I will eat my cowboy hat. Or my laptop.It has lovely performances by supporting cast members Virginia Madsen and even Bruce Willis: you have to figure the real Billy Bob has a lot of pals and cronies in Hollywood. None of which you can hate. Yes, Billy Bob WOULD have cronies. And Bruce Dern apears, looking a zillion years old. Either that is a really good make up job, or The Dern Family has the genetics of Yoda. Whoa!One good thing about this film is that you can do a lot of stuff like wash dishes, etc., and come back to check in on it, and nothing much has happened. I liked that aspect, as I always have stuff to do around the house.The son's acting was great--he was loyal and devoted... and his name in the movie was Shep. Note to self: I must name my next kid (or German Shepherd) Shep--awesome name! What is THAT a nickname for? Shepardly? Shepardoo? Shepardusty? I could go on all day.Ah!My husband enlightened me:  the kid was named Shep for Alan Shepard, OBVIOUSLY.He further informed me that Alan Shepard was the first American in space. He then read me what is known as ""Shepard's Prayer"". I can't print it here, but I think we all can relate to it.There is one inexplicable scene which appears to have spun crazily back in time to the 1800's for gratuitous reasons and as such is very dramatically shot, with sunset back lighting and stark silhouettes. Because one of my favorite movies is ""Unforgiven"", by Clint Eastwood, I see some references to that film shoehorned in there at that spot for dramatic effect. You'll know what I mean if you choose to see this.I do love a nice Billy Bob movie upon occasion, even though I find him, as a person, incredibly frightening. I would not like to be caught in a dark alley with Billy Bob. In REAL LIFE. Or in an elevator, a rocket, a bar in Vegas, or in the same state, for that matter.I would give this movie, The Astronaut Farmer, a B minus. I did indeed watch it, and I did indeed cry, so that is why it gets a B minus instead of a C minus. I wonder what Tennessee Williams would have done to the screenplay. Just an idle thought for fun.Well, there's nothing left to say but that I admit I like movies about people who have hopes and dreams, no mater how idiotic. I am just a sucker for that. I do love people who try.",3,The Don Quixote Movie of 2007,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,3904,"['Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'sort', 'movie', 'sort', 'kind', 'watchable', 'bed', 'wherever', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'comfort', 'spot', 'However', 'pretty', 'slow', 'going', 'posible', 'need', 'serious', 'editing.It', 'man', 'named', 'Farmer', 'get', 'astronaut', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'training', 'NASA', 'had', 'leave', 'go', 'home', 'save', 'family', 'losing', 'farm', 'when', 'father', 'dies', 'opportunity', 'go', 'space', 'However', 'dream', 'build', 'OWN', 'rocket', 'backyard.As', 'Judy', 'Tenuta', 'always', 'could', 'haaaaapen', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'movie', 'family', 'are', 'loyal', 'true', 'occasional', 'tantrum', 'wife', 'when', 'run', 'food', 'hate', 'when', 'husband', 'failed', 'astronaut', 'run', 'out', 'food', 'too', 'course', 'family', 'are', 'adorable', 'looking', 'look', 'came', 'children', 'clothing', 'catalog', 'frequently', 'run', 'around', 'wildflowers', 'filling', 'arms', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'farm', 'Possibly', 'was', 'dozing', 'off', 'point', 'maybe', 'actually', 'FARM', 'wildflowers.Billy', 'Bob', 'space', 'lot', 'serious', 'emoting', 'movie', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'being', 'him.It', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'aspect', 'poignant', 'Therefore', 'watch', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'anyone', 'see', 'crying', 'when', 'movie', 'sappy', 'sappy', 'cried', 'several', 'times', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'got', 'dust', 'eyes', 'several', 'times', 'snuffled', 'quietly', 'sudden', 'hay', 'fever', 'attack', '.Let', 'also', 'say', 'movie', 'ridiculously', 'improbable', 'true', 'story', 'will', 'eat', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'laptop.It', 'lovely', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'even', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'have', 'figure', 'real', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'lot', 'pals', 'cronies', 'Hollywood', 'None', 'can', 'hate', 'Yes', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'WOULD', 'have', 'cronies', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'apears', 'looking', 'zillion', 'years', 'old', 'really', 'good', 'make', 'up', 'job', 'Dern', 'Family', 'genetics', 'Yoda', 'Whoa', 'One', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'stuff', 'wash', 'dishes', 'etc.', 'come', 'back', 'check', 'nothing', 'much', 'happened', 'liked', 'aspect', 'always', 'have', 'stuff', 'do', 'around', 'house.The', 'son', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'loyal', 'devoted', 'name', 'movie', 'was', 'Shep', 'Note', 'self', 'must', 'name', 'next', 'kid', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'Shep', 'awesome', 'name', 'What', 'nickname', 'Shepardly', 'Shepardoo', 'Shepardusty', 'could', 'go', 'day.Ah', 'husband', 'enlightened', 'kid', 'was', 'named', 'Shep', 'Alan', 'Shepard', 'OBVIOUSLY.He', 'further', 'informed', 'Alan', 'Shepard', 'was', 'first', 'American', 'space', 'then', 'read', 'what', 'known', 'Shepard', 'Prayer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'print', 'here', 'think', 'can', 'relate', 'it.There', 'one', 'inexplicable', 'scene', 'have', 'spun', 'crazily', 'back', 'time', '1800', 'gratuitous', 'reasons', 'such', 'very', 'dramatically', 'shot', 'sunset', 'back', 'lighting', 'stark', 'silhouettes', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Unforgiven', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'see', 'references', 'film', 'shoehorned', 'spot', 'dramatic', 'effect', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'choose', 'see', 'this.I', 'do', 'love', 'nice', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'movie', 'occasion', 'even', 'find', 'person', 'incredibly', 'frightening', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'be', 'caught', 'dark', 'alley', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'REAL', 'LIFE', 'elevator', 'rocket', 'bar', 'Vegas', 'same', 'state', 'matter.I', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'B', 'minus', 'did', 'indeed', 'watch', 'did', 'indeed', 'cry', 'why', 'B', 'minus', 'instead', 'C', 'minus', 'wonder', 'what', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'screenplay', 'Just', 'idle', 'thought', 'fun.Well', 'nothing', 'left', 'say', 'admit', 'movies', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'mater', 'how', 'idiotic', 'am', 'just', 'sucker', 'do', 'love', 'people', 'who', 'try']",N/A
652382,A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y,B00005JPLE,Jeffrey A. Thompson,"[2, 2]","The reviewers of Ebert and Roeper liked this movie. I agree the movie has some cool scenes. When Billy Bob brought his ex-NASA pal to the barn and turned on the lights on the rocket, it was a really cool scene. Another scene was when Billy Bob was sitting in front of the rocket at night, drinking a beer and meditating on the rocket. Another cool scene is the successful take-off. They did a good job with it. The crash wasn't so good.The message of following your dreams no matter how bizarre is ok. The trouble is that a rocket is a dangerous thing. Men sometimes have to make choices and live with them. Mr. Farmer(Billy Bob) decided to drop out of the astronaut program because of a death of a family member. I agree with Bruce Willis's character here: you made the choice and you have to live with it.The other negative of the movies is that it too slow and too quirky. A guy wearing a spacesuit riding a horse is a unusual sight, but it doesn't make for an interesting movie. It was hard for me to sympathesize with Farmer. I can relate to his dream, but I would have taken the space shuttle option without a second thought. It would have been safer for everybody involved and yet, he would have gotten into space.I guess what summarizes the movie the best is the final scenes when ""Farmer"" is on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Yes, he would have been an unusual guest, but was this an interesting 3 or 5 minutes of my movie viewing time? Jay Leno interviewing a fictional guest? It was pretty boring.

This film doesn't have it.  The characters come across as mindless lunatics, folks you would rather see incarcerated for their own protection rather than your next door neighbors. Most farmers struggle to balance their books just making a living, yet this guy can build million-dollar machines before almost losing the farm.

Charlie has a dream about going into space in a home-made rocket ship.  Everyone thinks he's crazy, but his wife Audie (Virginia Madsen), along with the rest of his family support him completely.  Time passes, and work has progressed on the rocket.  However, things aren't going well financially for the Farmers.  The bank has threatened to foreclose on the house, Audie's father (Bruce Dern) has come to live with the family, and the FBI and the FAA have staked out Charlie's house after he attempted to purchase 10,000 gallons of rocket fuel online.  At a cost of $50,000, Charlie doesn't have the money for the fuel.  So, he goes to his local bank, where he's turned down for a loan.Meanwhile, a former astronaut friend of Charlie's (played by Bruce Willis) shows up at the house to try to dissuade Charlie from trying to launch his rocket.  This attempt fails, and Charlie presses on.  Later, a meeting is scheduled between Charlie and the FAA, and the FAA refuses to allow Charlie to launch.Desperate and running out of time before the bank forecloses, Charlie decides to make his own rocket fuel and launch anyway.  This turns into a disaster, as the launch goes terribly wrong.  Charlie ends up in the hospital with numerous broken bones.  Meanwhile, Audie's father has passed away, leaving a sizable sum of inheritance for the family.After convalescing at home, Charlie decides he's done with space travel.  Audie takes the money she inherited from her father to the bank to pay off the family's debts, but she changes her mind.  She returns home with the money and speaks with Charlie about the importance of following your dreams.  Soon, Charlie is at work on a new rocket.  This time, the launch works and, with the help of his son, Shephard (Max Thieriot), Charlie and  ""The Dreamer"" reach orbit.  After orbiting the earth nine times, Charlie touches down not far from his home, and he is picked up by his family.This is an inspiring and uplifting movie.  Granted, the plot may be a little far-fetched, but the message is not; learn to dream and then follow your dreams.  Billy Bob Thornton gives one of his best performances as Charlie, and Virginia Madsen is good, too.  Bruce Willis' cameo is a good addition to the film, as is Jay Leno's ""Tonight Show"" spoof.I give this movie my highest recommendation.

652387,AVVJNWI93MT1H,B00005JPLE,"J New York ""J New York""","[1, 7]","The science of this film is completely flawed.  From the rocket building, to the descent on land with nothing more than a parachute, surviving multiple orbits of the planet, breathing in space, remaining warm enough inside the cockpit, even down to the homemade space suit.  NONE of this is even remotely plausible, and to further insult your intelligence, when the farmer lands he does so within a short drive back to his farm, all without any contact with his makeshift ground control.  This film it is pure fiction.  But even if you buy into the ultimate white man fantasy premise, the film is still horrible.  Scene after scene plays out with predictable, sappy, emotionally charged energy, the acting is fair, but Billy Bob is completely unbelievable as the every day man farmer with his tooth veneers, drop dead stunning wife, and obvious plastic surgery.  The script is a mess of schlock, one zinger ""How about these flying saucers!"" as the farmer's wife throws a plate across the room!  As an audience member I felt manipulated by scene after scene desperately trying to get me to give a damn.  Instead of crying I found myself laughing at the absurdity of the entire mess.And for ""family values"", the message of this film, endanger your families financial well being, put you life on the line, spend hours away from them, just to live out your own unrealistic selfish dream.  The farmer literally can barely feed his children and nearly loses all of his assets, including his farm and home, but he isn't going to give up for the sake of his pride.  Not really a theme that I want to promote for children.Even the farmer's house was a hollywood fantasy in that it was large, beautifully decorated, with wrap around porches.  I grew up near farms and most farmers live very plainly as they work ALL DAY LONG!  They  don't have time to build rockets, or match Laura Ashley patterns with their drapes.The only thing that makes this film worth anything, is the beautiful cinematography.  Yes, the camera does capture the beauty of the American heartland, but THAT IS IT!

This movie is not stupid, but hugely ridiculous on so many levels it is hard to know where to begin. Let's start & end with Farmer. He's an ex NASA astronaut that never got his chance to go into space. He's obviously very intelligent. His family is functional, funny, loving & stable. He's not drunk & doesn't do drugs. He doesn't beat his wife, or kids & is from Texas. Yeah that's pretty unbelievable.This movie is about entertainment. What do we go to movies for? Escape. Suspend disbelief, let yourself go & enjoy the ride for a couple of hours. Anybody over ten knows this isn't just bad science, it's no science. Farmer builds a space ship not once but twice. He heals quickly, & his barn is resurrected after the first rocket crashes & doesn't explode (they always explode!) with 10,000 gallons of rocket fuel. He's mortgaged his ranch & still comes up with the spare parts & 10,000 more gallons of fuel to do it again & succeed. Our current government is truly stupid, but not so on drugs to allow this. One of the best lines, Upon being accused by feds of creating a WMD, Farmer replies ""If I was you wouldn't find me.""  They, the bank, the townsfolks are the requisite villians we need so we root for Farmer. His success gets him on Leno.

652392,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B00005JPLE,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[5, 6]","*No spoilers*Once again we come across another inspirational film to tell us that dreams do come true. The road to success is a difficult one--you might be the only one seeing it. The Astronaut Farmer is an uplifting, but formulistic film about a man who fought against all odds to follow the path to redemption--yes, we have seen it before, but it doesn't hurt to experience it again.Story:Texan farmer and ex astronaut-in-training Charles Farmer (Billy Bob Thornton) has a particular dream; he wants to go to space. In order to accomplish that, he builds a rocket--with a bunch of leftovers from a military junkyard--right in his barn. He is smart and has a strong engineering background to complete this peculiar, but dangerous project. His family and many of his friends support his goal, but unfortunately he is broke--the bank is about to take his property. Not only that, the government has found out about his ""project"" and will try to stop it. Will he ever launch his rocket?Review:The Astronaut Farmer brings back the same ""feel good"" formula of previous films like The World's Fastest Indian and The Pursuit of Happyness, where our main characters have one thing in common; they all want their dreams come true at any cost. In this film we see a supportive family--his wife and three kids--who stick with Farmer during the good times and bad. In a way, the rocket is what unites his family. They have no money--probably spent on the rocket--but he makes his family part of his dream by letting them participate in his project. Working on the rocket becomes a family tradition.I'm not a big fan of Billy Bob Thornton--the memories of Bad Santa and The Alamo are still fresh on my mind--but in this movie, he gives us a decent performance. He is a likable family man. His ""follow your dream"" clich&eacute; speech is not as uplifting as other similar films, but it gets the job done.The Astronaut Farmer was craftily shot. The special effects are about average, but create the desired effect--and some funny moments. It's not jaw-dropping a la Apollo 13 and it doesn't want to be.Unfortunately, not everything in The Astronaut Farmer is ""inspirational."" Low points of the film are the tiresome topic, soapy feeling and long draggy parts. The notion of somebody building a rocket in his farm--by himself and with almost no budget--to go to outer space is a bit far-fetched. Also some of the humor feels force and unnecessary, especially the ""it's so huge"" comments by a local girl.The Verdict:""Been there done that"" is what people are going to say when they get out of the theater. The Astronaut Farmer is another film that gives us hope--once again--to go ahead and build a rocket to reach our dreams. It has its flaws, but it's a good ""feel good"" family film nevertheless.My Score: 7",4,Reach the stars and your dreams,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2792,"['*No', 'spoilers*Once', 'again', 'come', 'inspirational', 'film', 'tell', 'do', 'come', 'true', 'road', 'success', 'difficult', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'seeing', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'uplifting', 'formulistic', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'fought', 'odds', 'follow', 'path', 'redemption', 'yes', 'have', 'seen', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'experience', 'again.Story', 'Texan', 'farmer', 'ex', 'astronaut-in-training', 'Charles', 'Farmer', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'particular', 'dream', 'go', 'space', 'order', 'accomplish', 'rocket', 'bunch', 'leftovers', 'military', 'junkyard', 'right', 'barn', 'smart', 'strong', 'engineering', 'background', 'complete', 'peculiar', 'dangerous', 'project', 'family', 'many', 'friends', 'support', 'goal', 'unfortunately', 'broke', 'bank', 'take', 'property', 'Not', 'only', 'government', 'found', 'out', 'project', 'will', 'try', 'stop', 'Will', 'ever', 'launch', 'rocket', 'Review', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'back', 'same', 'feel', 'good', 'formula', 'previous', 'films', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'want', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'cost', 'film', 'see', 'supportive', 'family', 'wife', 'three', 'kids', 'who', 'stick', 'Farmer', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'way', 'rocket', 'what', 'family', 'have', 'money', 'probably', 'spent', 'rocket', 'family', 'part', 'dream', 'letting', 'participate', 'project', 'Working', 'rocket', 'family', 'tradition.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'memories', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'Alamo', 'are', 'still', 'fresh', 'mind', 'movie', 'decent', 'performance', 'likable', 'family', 'man', 'follow', 'dream', 'clich', 'eacute', 'speech', 'not', 'as', 'uplifting', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'job', 'done.The', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'was', 'craftily', 'shot', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'average', 'create', 'desired', 'effect', 'funny', 'moments', 'not', 'jaw-dropping', 'la', 'Apollo', '13', ""n't"", 'want', 'be.Unfortunately', 'not', 'everything', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'inspirational', 'Low', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'tiresome', 'topic', 'soapy', 'feeling', 'long', 'draggy', 'parts', 'notion', 'somebody', 'building', 'rocket', 'farm', 'almost', 'budget', 'go', 'outer', 'space', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'Also', 'humor', 'feels', 'force', 'unnecessary', 'especially', 'so', 'huge', 'comments', 'local', 'girl.The', 'Verdict', 'done', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'say', 'when', 'get', 'theater', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'film', 'hope', 'once', 'again', 'go', 'ahead', 'build', 'rocket', 'reach', 'dreams', 'flaws', 'good', 'feel', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'nevertheless.My', 'Score', '7']",N/A

I guess that's a tribute to the way the movie sort of makes you believe.  Charles Farmer might be a real guy, but if so, he had the kind of dream you just don't find anywhere else but in Hollywood movies.  This is a quasi-""indie"" sort of mood picture from the Polish brothers (who show up as government agents halfway through the film), and it uses mostly actors you recall from various indie pictures over the years.  For me, the highlight was seeing yet another grand old ""old man"" performance by the underrated Bruce Dern, whose new memoir I reviewed recently.  Dern doesn't have to say a word (in fact most of the time he just shows his face, with Einstein hair exploding from his skull, so at first he looks like Christopher Lloyd from the BACK TO THE FUTURE movies).  Indeed BACK TO THE FUTURE now that I think of it must have as much of a ""real science"" basis as THE ASTRONAUT FARMER and was likely a direct influence on it.  Anyway Dern has only one scene where he does any talking at all, and yet, his quiet and heroic individuality dominate every scene of the picture.Virginia Madsen might be asking her agent, ""Why did you let me do this?"" and yet at the end of the day I expect she will be glad she has this film to look back on.  The two twin brothers who wrote and directed this film must have been in love with her.  I have never seen her photographed looking so gorgeous, young, or sexy, even when she was a starlet 25 years ago.  She is incredible here and by the way, she's what gives the movie its reality quotient, not white-lipped, white-haired Billy Bob Thornton.I kept wishing the rocket would somehow strand the two little girls out in space or something.  They were annoying plus.  Take them out of school?  Leave them in school?  I just couldn't get interested.

He's never given up his dream, however, and so he builds a rocket one piece at a time in his barn, and gets into plenty of trouble along the way.It's a great idea for a movie, but it doesn't quite work.  The reason why it doesn't work in my opinion is the pacing of the movie.  It plods like a Clydesdale from one scene to the next, with a soundrack as dreary (in a pleasant way) as the pleasantly dreary small town the movie is set in.  The only scene with real intensity is when Farmer and his wife have an arguement and she throws the brick at him for running the household into bankruptcy.  Wanna see a flying saucer?  Ha ha ha.So, we're half way through this movie and my wife is using words like ""brutal"" and ""torture"" to describe the experience of watching this movie, and then we both go into Mystery Science Theater mode and start making wise cracks because we've lost our ability to take this much longer.  Just launch the rocket already!Anyway, after my wife hit the emergency escape and rocketed away to something more interesting, I stayed with the movie all the way to it's predictable ending.  I also watched the bonus features, which are at least as entertaining as the movie itself.Another thing about the movie that bothered me is that it started after the rocket was completed.  It's really not a story of a farmer who decided to build a rocket in his barn, but rather a story of a farmer who had a rocket already built in his barn, and that leaves the audience to sit through one increasingly tedious scene after another to fill in the backstory.  The movie itself is about launching the rocket in the face of much opposition.So, it's a not really a bad movie, and I understand why some people like it, but there's something that just isn't there that would have made it a much better movie.  Watch this for light family fare, and see if your whole family stays until the end.On a positive note, I think this movie made a good point about how the wonder of the space program has somehow been lost.

Thompson ""Book Lover""","[2, 2]","Don't get me wrong - despite his odd personal life I've always admired Thornton's ability as an actor - he is nothing if not talented but this little piece is a diamond in the rough and as Farmer he shines.  Virginia Madsen's performance is nuanced and heartfelt.  The child actors chosen as their children are each unique and believable - particularly ""Shep"" - a young man I hope we see more of.  Bruce Dern - despite the brevity of his screen time - is his usual charming self.  The movie is beautifully cast.  The actors chosen to portray the odd lot of townspeople provide full-bodied character development and there's a small part by a big star that does nothing to take away from the rest of the cast.  Without giving too much away, the bad guys aren't all that bad, and the good guys aren't perfect.  Don't be disillusioned, however.  This isn't a cookie cutter ""feel-good"" flick.  The plot is utterly believable, the directing is top notch, and the execution - but for a few missteps - is engaging.  It's a kind-hearted, makes-you-want-to-believe movie.  I particularly liked a scene where Farmer meets a clip-board toting trespasser in his pasture.  Watch for it - it's understated elegance.

If that is what you take away from this film then so-be-it, but I think these reviews have read far too much into this ridiculous film.What I saw was an extraordinarily selfish guy who risks the well being of his own family in many, many ways to realize a silly dream that produces absolutely no value to anyone except him.  It begs the question: why did he bother having a family at all?  Why not pursue the dream alone?  Forget about the absurdity of a guy living in the sticks and his kid building a craft safe enough to launch let alone orbit the earth nine times.  So many flaws I can't name them all. It took many millions of dollars and a group of highly skilled ex-scientists, pilots, and mathematicians several years in California to accomplish the same experiment and launch SpaceShipOne into space in 2004.  Launching oneself into space for a little joyride provides no added benefit to society...nothing. The California joyriders all had money to burn and their families would have been well taken care of should disaster have struck.  Not so in this silly movie. This film is as empty as its premise.  In the end it delivers nothing.  What it does do is perpetuate the fairy tale that one should follow all dreams at any cost.  This is bad advice because the odds of success are infinitesimal.  At some point one must make the dream a hobby and get a real job that produces value.Two stars ONLY for Virginia Madsen.  She always adds ethos to any film and this is no exception.

652411,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPLE,Roland E. Zwick,"[23, 59]","**1/2I've heard of ""suspension of disbelief"" before, but this is ridiculous!""The Astronaut Farmer"" features one of the loopiest, looniest premises ever to grace a mainstream American movie.  A middle-aged rancher named Farmer (you know a movie`s heading into seriously pretentious waters when it starts dispensing heavily allegorical names to its characters), has decided to fulfill his lifelong dream of flying into outer space.  To this end, he has single-handedly constructed a fully functioning rocket that, in the real world, would require an army of NASA engineers and millions of dollars in government money to put together.  Heck, for sheer grandiosity and technological ingenuity, Farmer's homemade rocket makes Ray Kinsella's backyard baseball stadium in ""Field of Dreams"" look like erector-set kids' stuff in comparison.In a film shamelessly bucking for the ""feel-good movie of the year"" stamp-of-approval, Farmer is obviously intended to be an inspirational figure, a little man with a Big Dream who is determined to make that dream come true at any and all costs and despite the seemingly insurmountable odds stacked against him.  Yet, even in a fantasy film, the dream has to have some connection with reality, some degree of plausibility to make us believe in it to the same extent that the character does.  Unfortunately, in ""The Astronaut Farmer,"" we find ourselves more often siding with the derisive skeptics and cynical killjoys from NASA, the FBI, and the nearby town - who, of course, are portrayed as the villains of the piece - than with Farmer and his preposterously supportive family who already seem to be living on another planet anyway (which tends to negate the need for any such trip in the first place).Indeed, questions of mental balance are never far from our minds when we see Farmer (well played by Billy Bob Thornton) bankrupting his ranch to finance his quest and dragging his 15-year-old son and two pre-pubescent daughters out of school so that they can function as his Mission Control team of ""experts,"" who are going to be responsible for not only launching him into space but returning him safely back therefrom (not too much undue pressure there, is there?).  And what are we to make of the fact that Farmer is so obsessed with fulfilling his own dream that he's willing to go on this potential suicide mission with the distinct possibility that he will leave his wife a widow and his children without a father?  In his reckless disregard for the consequences of his actions, Farmer goes well beyond the harmless Quixotic crackpot that the script intends him to be and becomes a genuine threat to the lives and safety of himself and those around him.  Even his wife (Virginia Madsen), who is portrayed as a relatively clear-thinking, level-headed pragmatist, is really little more than an enabler who, instead of putting the brakes on her husband's obvious foolishness, encourages him to ever more dangerous heights of certifiable insanity.The actors - Thornton, Madsen, Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, Max Thieriot - do what they can with what they've been handed, but the screenplay by Mark and Michael Polish is so filled with sappy, a-guy's-gotta-dream inspirational speeches and cued-up musical crescendos that we feel worked-over and manipulated from first moment to last.  The movie does look terrific, however, with director Michael Polish and cinematographer M. David Mullen using the wide open spaces of the rural western landscape to impressive effect.I know that we're not supposed to take this movie all that seriously, that we are expected to check our credulity at the theater door for the duration of the movie, then pick it up on the way back out.  But even a fantasy film has to make some sort of reasonable compact with its audience and ""The Astronaut Farmer"" asks us to accept far too much on sheer goodwill and faith alone.  Yet, you know a movie isn't working when, instead of rooting for the protagonist to succeed in his adventure, you find yourself hoping that some trained, licensed professional will step in and perform an intervention on him before he does serious injury to himself and his loved ones.I have been a great admirer of the Polish Brothers' work in the past - ""Twin Falls Idaho,"" ""Northfork"" etc. - but ""The Astronaut Farmer"" is a fool's mission that should never even have been brought to the launching pad, let alone cleared for take-off.",2,The Astro-nut,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,4419,"['**1/2I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'ridiculous', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'one', 'loopiest', 'looniest', 'premises', 'ever', 'grace', 'mainstream', 'American', 'movie', 'middle-aged', 'rancher', 'named', 'Farmer', 'know', 'movie', 's', 'heading', 'seriously', 'pretentious', 'waters', 'when', 'dispensing', 'heavily', 'allegorical', 'names', 'characters', 'decided', 'fulfill', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'flying', 'outer', 'space', 'end', 'single-handedly', 'constructed', 'fully', 'functioning', 'rocket', 'real', 'world', 'would', 'require', 'army', 'NASA', 'engineers', 'millions', 'dollars', 'government', 'money', 'put', 'together', 'Heck', 'sheer', 'grandiosity', 'technological', 'ingenuity', 'Farmer', 'homemade', 'rocket', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'backyard', 'baseball', 'stadium', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'look', 'erector-set', 'kids', 'stuff', 'comparison.In', 'film', 'shamelessly', 'bucking', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'year', 'stamp-of-approval', 'Farmer', 'obviously', 'intended', 'be', 'inspirational', 'figure', 'little', 'man', 'Big', 'Dream', 'who', 'determined', 'make', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'costs', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'stacked', 'even', 'fantasy', 'film', 'dream', 'have', 'connection', 'reality', 'degree', 'plausibility', 'make', 'believe', 'same', 'extent', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'find', 'more', 'often', 'siding', 'derisive', 'skeptics', 'cynical', 'killjoys', 'NASA', 'FBI', 'nearby', 'town', 'who', 'course', 'are', 'portrayed', 'villains', 'piece', 'Farmer', 'preposterously', 'supportive', 'family', 'who', 'already', 'seem', 'be', 'living', 'planet', 'anyway', 'negate', 'need', 'such', 'trip', 'first', 'place', '.Indeed', 'questions', 'mental', 'balance', 'are', 'never', 'far', 'minds', 'when', 'see', 'Farmer', 'well', 'played', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'bankrupting', 'ranch', 'finance', 'quest', 'dragging', '15-year-old', 'son', 'two', 'pre-pubescent', 'daughters', 'school', 'can', 'function', 'Mission', 'Control', 'team', 'experts', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'responsible', 'not', 'only', 'launching', 'space', 'returning', 'safely', 'back', 'therefrom', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'undue', 'pressure', 'there', 'there', 'are', 'make', 'fact', 'Farmer', 'so', 'obsessed', 'fulfilling', 'own', 'dream', 'willing', 'go', 'potential', 'suicide', 'mission', 'distinct', 'possibility', 'will', 'leave', 'wife', 'widow', 'children', 'father', 'reckless', 'disregard', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Farmer', 'well', 'harmless', 'Quixotic', 'crackpot', 'script', 'be', 'becomes', 'genuine', 'threat', 'lives', 'safety', 'Even', 'wife', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'who', 'portrayed', 'relatively', 'clear-thinking', 'level-headed', 'pragmatist', 'really', 'little', 'more', 'enabler', 'who', 'instead', 'putting', 'brakes', 'husband', 'obvious', 'foolishness', 'ever', 'more', 'dangerous', 'heights', 'certifiable', 'insanity.The', 'actors', 'Thornton', 'Madsen', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'handed', 'screenplay', 'Mark', 'Michael', 'Polish', 'so', 'filled', 'sappy', ""a-guy's-"", 'got', 'ta', '-dream', 'inspirational', 'speeches', 'cued-up', 'musical', 'crescendos', 'feel', 'worked-over', 'manipulated', 'first', 'moment', 'last', 'movie', 'look', 'terrific', 'however', 'director', 'Michael', 'Polish', 'cinematographer', 'M.', 'David', 'Mullen', 'using', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'rural', 'western', 'landscape', 'impressive', 'effect.I', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'are', 'expected', 'check', 'credulity', 'theater', 'door', 'duration', 'movie', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'way', 'back', 'out', 'even', 'fantasy', 'film', 'make', 'sort', 'reasonable', 'compact', 'audience', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'accept', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'sheer', 'goodwill', 'faith', 'alone', 'know', 'movie', ""n't"", 'working', 'when', 'instead', 'rooting', 'protagonist', 'succeed', 'adventure', 'find', 'hoping', 'trained', 'licensed', 'professional', 'will', 'step', 'perform', 'intervention', 'serious', 'injury', 'loved', 'ones.I', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'admirer', 'Polish', 'Brothers', 'work', 'past', 'Twin', 'Falls', 'Idaho', 'Northfork', 'etc', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'fool', 'mission', 'should', 'never', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'launching', 'pad', 'let', 'alone', 'cleared', 'take-off']",N/A

652420,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPLE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[75, 84]","Let's take a quick look at a couple of key elements of the new film ""The Astronaut Farmer"", starring Billy Bob Thornton, Virginia Madsen, Bruce Dern and Tim Blake Nelson.Charles Farmer (Thornton) and his family live on a farm in a small town called Story, Texas. Farmer has dreamed of traveling into space and now uses the family's large barn to build a spaceship called The Dreamer. He has managed to convince his wife, Audie (Madsen) that he can do this. His son, Shepherd (Max Thierot) helps him build the spaceship and will presumably run mission control. Their two younger daughters are basically the cheering section and provide Farmer with a reason to live the dream.Okay, so right away, ""The Astronaut Farmer"" has various telltale signs of a fantasy film or a tall tale. Charles Farmer, a farmer, lives in Story, Texas and builds a spaceship called The Dreamer. Clearly, ""The Astronaut Farmer"" is not a true story, a story based in reality. It is a fable, a story of dreamers, of hope. And a darned good example of this, a very good film for every one of all ages. Please go and see this film. It needs your support.Written and directed by the Polish Brothers, Mark and Michael (""Twin Falls, Idaho"", ""Northfork""), you can see influences from each of their previous films in this new title. ""Twin Falls"" told the story of conjoined twins, played by the Polish Brothers, who fall in love with the same woman. A strange, but interesting film telling a unique story. ""Farmer"" has strange, but interesting elements combined into a very personal, almost beautiful story about a family pulling together to fulfill their dreams.This strange film is surprisingly moving and effective. As soon as we meet Farmer, we realize he is a man with a dream, a dream he has spent years trying to achieve. The rocket is both a metaphor and a tangible result of this dream. He wouldn't have been able to do this without the support of his family; his wife, Audie works a day job at the local diner to earn money trying to keep the family afloat, his teenage son, Shep, clearly idolizes his father and is just as committed to the dream, and their two daughters run around, the younger girl mimicking everything her older sister says. This is a tightly knit family working towards a crazy, maybe unbelievable goal. But Farmer's enthusiasm makes it real, and the filmmakers allow us to join the story near the completion of the space ship. We see that he is almost done with the craft, making it a tangible thing. Because we see it, we are more apt to believe it. And Farmer is such a forceful personality; he makes us believe he can build a spaceship after years of studying. He is so forceful in his enthusiasm we don't even question where or how he got all of the equipment or the money he needed to construct the vehicle. At one point, he tries to buy some fuel and finds out it will cost $50,000. He goes to the bank to get a loan on the farm, but they won't loan him any more money.The filmmakers smartly include a bit of reality into the story. Farmer receives a notice from the bank and meets with the bank president. The town is so small, there is one bank and Farmer and the president know each other. We learn Farmer inherited a lot of debt from his dad and struggles to make the payments. It doesn't help the future astronaut spends most of his time and money on the craft, bringing in little (if any) revenue from the farm. They are seriously behind and may lose the family home. This sets up a `ticking clock' for Farmer. He soon realizes he has to launch the spaceship before the bank has a chance to foreclose. As soon as he launches, everything will be all right. He has no doubt. Once he achieves his dream, everything will be all better. And, if Farmer has a dream, his feelings are so infectious we share the dream.""Farmer"" also stays true to the landscape, rural Texas, and shows the flat, dusty, sun beaten landscape in a beautiful, unique way, much like ""Northfork"", about a rural town preparing for an inevitable flood, to provide a new municipal water source. Story is a small town and all of the inhabitants have lived there forever, everyone knows one another and the businesses and buildings have seen better days. When Charlie is ordered to get a psychiatric review, he is sent to the school nurse (Julie White), a former girlfriend who holds a grudge. When the U.S. Government holds an inquiry, it takes over the school auditorium.As soon as Farmer's dreams start to penetrate, and the date of the launch draws near, everyone posts banners and signs proclaiming Charlie Farmer is an inhabitant of the town, they are proud of their native son, Charlie eats here. When the news media arrives, they camp out at the Farmer farm, a beautiful homestead on a lake, with a large barn. At one point, Farmer stands on a small rise and surveys the rest of the farm, at dusk, watching his cows roam the prairie. In this way, the film uses the landscape as a character; helping to invoke both the small town feel of the surroundings and adding to their characters.""Farmer"" isn't perfect. A third act plot point strains credibility and threatens to derail the story. It is clearly included to ratchet up the suspense and create more drama, but it makes Farmer seem a completely different person; a man who has followed his dream for this long would never take such a chance. Thankfully, this is a relatively brief moment and the film soon returns to the story we were once promised.The acting is universally good and adds a nice, folksy element to the story. Thornton is quiet and reserved, but infectious when discussing his dreams. Farmer is a Texas native and it would seem out of place if he went around hugging people and introducing himself to strangers. In a small town like Story, there are no strangers. That would also seem strange. Madsen is very good as his supporting, loving wife. She doesn't mind working to help make ends meet but only becomes alarmed when she learns of the family's true financial status. She seems to be more hurt because her husband didn't confide in her. Max Thierot is very good as their teenaged son. He doesn't have time for the normal teenaged influences; he has to help his dad build a spaceship. Bruce Dern plays Audie's dad, who lives with them and dotes on the grandkids. He adds a nice folksy feel to the story. Tim Blake Nelson plays Charlie's friend and lawyer, who helps defend him when the government comes to make an inquiry.""The Astronaut Farmer"" is a really good film about a family who lives a mutual dream, bringing them together, making them closer and more loving. Charlie Farmer has such an infectious, moving dream, it is all but impossible to become involved in and share the same dreams.This is a film that needs your support. It tells a moving story and is very well-made. Yet the film had a terrible opening weekend and it already being pulled from some theaters. Show Hollywood that you have an appetite for films like this. Give it your support. Before it's too late and the multiplexes are filled with yet another sequel to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" or ""Norbit"".",4,"This ""Farmer"" Has A Dream",1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,7124,"['Let',

652421,A1E8RC0BLALMUN,B00005JPLE,T. Smith,"[0, 2]","So many panned this film and but I enjoyed it. Many of the negatives about it stemed from the fact that instead of looking at the piece as story about dreaming and loss innocence, too many writers got caught up in looking at technical stuff as we have been taken been over and captured in the hi-tech world of ipods, blackberries, hi-def, hi-tech innovation, hi-gadgetry and the god of science and hi-innovation. Dreaming somehow is lost and that is good because it is has no circuits and logic boards to examine therefore can dreaming be good for us?Critics nitpicked and complain about technical mistakes in term of aspects of the rocket. Why was more not shown of them building the rocket? The fuel mixture was crazy. One person could never build such a device. To complicated for one. It would never fly and other technicalities on and on. However, their complaints are while perhaps somewhat legit are also irrelevant in the space of the story. It is not about space or rockets or fuel ratios anymore than Field of Dreams was tale of baseball. It is entertainment first and foremost and a metaphor for the dreamers amongus.The Polish Brothers wanted to make a more Hollywood type piece but true to their sensibility would not give in to the Hollywood model and wanted to tell the story in their own way. This film would not have worked if the big Hollywood machine had been trucked in with high price gunslingers playing the parts. It is the Polish brother's material and thankfully they kept with their own ideals and Kudos' to them for sticking to their personal vision. Listen to the praise in the DVD from comments by Billy Bob Thornton and others that he gives the Polish Brothers so much credit for staying with their ideals.This story does not resonate with many of who are have become cynics to anything not empirical thus and given up on dreaming. Dreams are dangerous. They are a threat to many who believe in big brother or the experts and government for directing telling them what can be done and what is right or wrong. As the film and its commentary notes, we have lost the magic of believing we can do anything we want if and believe it hard enough and put enough effort in to make it happen.Yes, to enjoy the film your belief must be suspended. However, you do that in most films anyway so it is not a huge issue. The idea is building of a rocket is stretching things. So be it. Although note that in the real world at last 1 person has tried to follow the example of what Charles Farmer was doing in the picture.It is family centered about  people supporting each other and believing in something so much and supporting themselves standing alone when society has dictated what want to do in cant be done because experts have forbidden it. As the characters say we have many laws to protect from other laws. The film hints we are being driven by legislated common sense. Family values rooted in a world where the concept of family is broken down. As Ms. Madsen herself says in her comments, it is about family with heart and soul and being told in the right way. This does come across in the piece whether you believe the rocket could work or pigs fly.There is electric chemistry between Madsen and Thornton. They light up the screen in the support for each other. Thornton was a great casting choice, Very much the guy next door you could like and Madsen is his pillar and counterpoint. (Spoiler alert coming) really letting her husband (Thornton know when she starts to see the rocket idea affecting the family core values and structure). The flying saucer scene shows Madsen's great strength as an actress going from two opposite ends of emotions and coming back in a to where she began in powerful believable piece of acting.It is good storytelling all around. Polish Brothers show they have depth and want to take their turn to make a more glossy Hollywood type production on their own terms with their own edge and humor.Appropriate that the rocket was called the Dreamer. Perhaps this might have been a title. The dream, the dreamer and loss of that dream magic with a few hard life lessons added in were all woven together This resonated with me through the film.Was it perfect no? But as a creative dreamer, I connected with the message and the believable characters. I was not overly picked that science was not perfect.tms",3,Astronaut Farmer:  magic of the dreamer not rocket science....,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,4355,"['So', 'many', 'panned', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'Many', 'negatives', 'stemed', 'fact', 'instead', 'looking', 'piece', 'story', 'dreaming', 'loss', 'innocence', 'too', 'many', 'writers', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'looking', 'technical', 'stuff', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'been', 'captured', 'hi-tech', 'world', 'ipods', 'blackberries', 'hi-def', 'hi-tech', 'innovation', 'hi-gadgetry', 'god', 'science', 'hi-innovation', 'Dreaming', 'somehow', 'lost', 'good', 'circuits', 'logic', 'boards', 'examine', 'therefore', 'can', 'dreaming', 'be', 'good', 'Critics', 'nitpicked', 'complain', 'technical', 'mistakes', 'term', 'aspects', 'rocket', 'Why', 'was', 'more', 'not', 'shown', 'building', 'rocket', 'fuel', 'mixture', 'was', 'crazy', 'One', 'person', 'could', 'never', 'build', 'such', 'device', 'complicated', 'one', 'would', 'never', 'fly', 'other', 'technicalities', 'However', 'complaints', 'are', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'legit', 'are', 'also', 'irrelevant', 'space', 'story', 'not', 'about', 'space', 'rockets', 'fuel', 'ratios', 'anymore', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'was', 'tale', 'baseball', 'entertainment', 'first', 'foremost', 'metaphor', 'dreamers', 'amongus.The', 'Polish', 'Brothers', 'wanted', 'make', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'piece', 'true', 'sensibility', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'Hollywood', 'model', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', 'own', 'way', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'had', 'been', 'trucked', 'high', 'price', 'gunslingers', 'playing', 'parts', 'Polish', 'brother', 'material', 'thankfully', 'kept', 'own', 'ideals', 'Kudos', 'sticking', 'personal', 'vision', 'Listen', 'praise', 'DVD', 'comments', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'others', 'Polish', 'Brothers', 'so', 'much', 'credit', 'staying', 'ideals.This', 'story', 'not', 'resonate', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'have', 'become', 'cynics', 'anything', 'not', 'empirical', 'thus', 'given', 'up', 'dreaming', 'Dreams', 'are', 'dangerous', 'are', 'threat', 'many', 'who', 'believe', 'big', 'brother', 'experts', 'government', 'directing', 'telling', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'film', 'commentary', 'notes', 'have', 'lost', 'magic', 'believing', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'want', 'believe', 'hard', 'enough', 'put', 'enough', 'effort', 'make', 'enjoy', 'film', 'belief', 'must', 'be', 'suspended', 'However', 'do', 'most', 'films', 'anyway', 'not', 'huge', 'issue', 'idea', 'building', 'rocket', 'stretching', 'things', 'So', 'be', 'note', 'real', 'world', 'last', '1', 'person', 'tried', 'follow', 'example', 'what', 'Charles', 'Farmer', 'was', 'doing', 'picture.It', 'family', 'centered', 'people', 'supporting', 'other', 'believing', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'supporting', 'standing', 'alone', 'when', 'society', 'dictated', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'cant', 'be', 'done', 'because', 'experts', 'have', 'forbidden', 'characters', 'say', 'have', 'many', 'laws', 'protect', 'other', 'laws', 'film', 'hints', 'are', 'being', 'driven', 'legislated', 'common', 'sense', 'Family', 'values', 'rooted', 'world', 'where', 'concept', 'family', 'broken', 'down', 'Ms.', 'Madsen', 'comments', 'family', 'heart', 'soul', 'being', 'told', 'right', 'way', 'come', 'piece', 'believe', 'rocket', 'could', 'work', 'pigs', 'electric', 'chemistry', 'Madsen', 'Thornton', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'support', 'other', 'Thornton', 'was', 'great', 'casting', 'choice', 'Very', 'much', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'could', 'like', 'Madsen', 'pillar', 'counterpoint', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'coming', 'really', 'letting', 'husband', 'Thornton', 'know', 'when', 'see', 'rocket', 'idea', 'affecting', 'family', 'core', 'values', 'structure', 'flying', 'saucer', 'scene', 'Madsen', 'great', 'strength', 'actress', 'going', 'two', 'opposite', 'ends', 'emotions', 'coming', 'back', 'where', 'began', 'powerful', 'believable', 'piece', 'acting.It', 'good', 'storytelling', 'around', 'Polish', 'Brothers', 'show', 'have', 'depth', 'want', 'take', 'turn', 'make', 'more', 'glossy', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'production', 'own', 'terms', 'own', 'edge', 'humor.Appropriate', 'rocket', 'was', 'called', 'Dreamer', 'Perhaps', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'title', 'dream', 'dreamer', 'loss', 'dream', 'magic', 'few', 'hard', 'life', 'lessons', 'added', 'were', 'woven', 'together', 'resonated', 'film.Was', 'creative', 'dreamer', 'connected', 'message', 'believable', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'picked', 'science', 'was', 'not', 'perfect.tms']",N/A
652422,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPLE,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","""The Astronaut Farmer"" is a family picture with a simple, heartfelt message: Dreams will come true. The most unique thing about the film is, however, the dream itself the film's protagonist Charles Farmer (played by Billy Bob Thornton, wonderful as always) has - Charles, a former pilot who was once trained to be an astronaut at NASA, but was forced to retire before flying, builds a rocket on his own, spending ten years and every dollar his family could save.Another unique part of the film is the film's time setting. Charles Farmer's handmade rocket may look very old-fashioned, but the film's story is set in modern-day, post-9/11 America. So FBI interferes when Farmer tries to buy rocket fuel (10,000 gallons), considering him dangerous to the country. Still overall tone of the film remains optimistic throughout. Mr. Farmer is under watch of the agents, but they are described with a low-key comic touch. Bruce Willis briefly shows up as an astronaut (reminding us of ""Armageddon"" in which Billy Bob Thornton also appears). This is one of the film's very amusing moments.But you may not like some parts of the film. Reviewers have rightly pointed out that ""The Astronaut Farmer"" ignores so many technical details about going to the space, but I think our willing suspension of disbelief is tested by the attitudes of Mr. Farmer himself towards the people surrounding him, rather than by the overlong climax, its implausibility or scientific background.I say this because I think there is another story, or version of the story said above, which directors the Polish Brothers should have considered. You might think Charles Farmer is in fact putting his family in danger, financially and even physically. In one scene some people are nearly killed, which justifies the government's action to stall his flight. If for all Billy Bob Thornton's fine acting I couldn't relate to him as much as the film wants us to, this should be the reason.But the three children are corporative. The boy is ready to help his father all the time. His wife (Virginia Madsen) is naturally (and rightly) worried, but she understands. Charles is never given a real task that is more challenging than outwitting FBI, CIA and FAA. He doesn't really have to deal with the downside of his dream. ""October Sky,"" which has a similar theme, at least suggests there is another side of chasing your dream by showing Chris Cooper's father figure and contrasting it with his boy's to show the convincing father-and-son conflict.Or maybe I am taking this film too seriously. But perhaps I should take the matter seriously when happiness of the members of my family is at stake. Certainly this is a feel-good picture with a simple story. But maybe you will find things are not that simple as the film shows.",3,"Good, Old-Fashioned Family Picture, Not Entirely Engaging Though",1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,2780,"['Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'family', 'picture', 'simple', 'heartfelt', 'message', 'Dreams', 'will', 'come', 'true', 'most', 'unique', 'thing', 'film', 'however', 'dream', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Charles', 'Farmer', 'played', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'wonderful', 'always', 'Charles', 'former', 'pilot', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'trained', 'be', 'astronaut', 'NASA', 'was', 'forced', 'retire', 'flying', 'rocket', 'own', 'spending', 'ten', 'years', 'dollar', 'family', 'could', 'save.Another', 'unique', 'part', 'film', 'film', 'time', 'setting', 'Charles', 'Farmer', 'handmade', 'rocket', 'may', 'look', 'very', 'old-fashioned', 'film', 'story', 'set', 'modern-day', 'post-9/11', 'America', 'So', 'FBI', 'when', 'Farmer', 'buy', 'rocket', 'fuel', '10,000', 'gallons', 'considering', 'dangerous', 'country', 'Still', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'optimistic', 'Mr.', 'Farmer', 'watch', 'agents', 'are', 'described', 'low-key', 'comic', 'touch', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'briefly', 'up', 'astronaut', 'reminding', 'Armageddon', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'very', 'amusing', 'moments.But', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'parts', 'film', 'Reviewers', 'have', 'rightly', 'pointed', 'out', 'Astronaut', 'Farmer', 'so', 'many', 'technical', 'details', 'going', 'space', 'think', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'tested', 'attitudes', 'Mr.', 'Farmer', 'people', 'surrounding', 'rather', 'overlong', 'climax', 'implausibility', 'scientific', 'background.I', 'say', 'think', 'story', 'version', 'story', 'said', 'directors', 'Polish', 'Brothers', 'should', 'have', 'considered', 'might', 'think', 'Charles', 'Farmer', 'fact', 'putting', 'family', 'danger', 'financially', 'even', 'physically', 'one', 'scene', 'people', 'are', 'nearly', 'killed', 'government', 'action', 'stall', 'flight', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'fine', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'reason.But', 'three', 'children', 'are', 'corporative', 'boy', 'ready', 'help', 'father', 'time', 'wife', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'naturally', 'rightly', 'worried', 'Charles', 'never', 'given', 'real', 'task', 'more', 'challenging', 'outwitting', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'FAA', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'deal', 'downside', 'dream', 'October', 'Sky', 'similar', 'theme', 'least', 'suggests', 'side', 'chasing', 'dream', 'showing', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'father', 'figure', 'contrasting', 'boy', 'show', 'convincing', 'father-and-son', 'conflict.Or', 'maybe', 'am', 'taking', 'film', 'too', 'seriously', 'perhaps', 'should', 'take', 'matter', 'seriously', 'when', 'happiness', 'members', 'family', 'stake', 'Certainly', 'feel-good', 'picture', 'simple', 'story', 'maybe', 'will', 'find', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'that', 'film', 'shows']",N/A

The fact that his family sticks through it with him, even though at times their belief in him is tested, was what I thought the bigger lesson in this movie.  To support those in your family in attempting to fulfill their dream, through accomplishment and/or failure, is the sign of a healthy and happy family.A beautiful movie with real people in excitingly unreal roles.  Billy Bob Thornton, Virginia Madsen and the three kid actors capture the essence of a family living with an unfulfilled dream and the loving sacrifice to see that dream fulfilled.  Grandfather, husband, wife, son, daughter, they all have so much to lose and gain by one's fulfillment of the dream.
