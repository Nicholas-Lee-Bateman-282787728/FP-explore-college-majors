You don't need to know the manga (I didn't), to enjoy the story, so definitely recommend this one.There is mild nudity, could have done without the nude bathing scene and occasionally forced hints at lesbianism, but other than that, solid series, great plot, excellent voice acting, well-animated, and a good combination of both action and the humanity that drives all the characters.",4,Almost didn't watch the series after Episode 1,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,668,"['Yep', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'opened', '5', '6', 'characters', 'thought', 'were', 'pretty', 'cool', 'then', 'proceeded', 'do', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect.In', 'event', 'series', 'prequel', 'manga', 'series', 'concluded', '12', 'volumes', 'backstory', 'manga', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'manga', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'story', 'so', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'one.There', 'mild', 'nudity', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'nude', 'bathing', 'scene', 'occasionally', 'forced', 'hints', 'lesbianism', 'other', 'solid', 'series', 'great', 'plot', 'excellent', 'voice', 'acting', 'well-animated', 'good', 'combination', 'action', 'humanity', 'characters']",N/A

1397174,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B004DMIINM,Coulter Rail,"[1, 1]","Ga Rei Zero was a pleasant surprise.  It's a story about an elite unit of evil spirit vanquishers.  They are the classic motley crew of anime cool.  There are the twins with big guns, the guy with drills on his hands, a machinegun-suitcases wielding smack talker, the ladies man with killer ferrets, and our fem fatale, katana drawing duet.This series tries to follow in the vein of ""Berserk"", where the story starts at the end, we see some tragic affairs, and then the rest of narrative focuses on how we got there.The animation is above what I expected as the action is well choreographed with very few gimmicks and shortcuts.  The violence is there in all its scarlet glory, but is not excessive.  The characters are fun and almost deep.Where this show falls short of 4 stars, is in the concept it's trying to champion.  ""Berserk"" left almost all of the puzzle pieces a mystery so that uncovering the past was rewarding at every turn, and the relationships were highly detailed.  The final event also left a punch to the heart that was surprising, horrific, and nothing short of a Shakespearean level tragedy.  Ga Rei Zero shows you the betrayal and decimation of the team at the hands of Yomi in the first two episodes.  Even going back to the beginning, the audience already knows that we're on a journey to see the two friends fight to the death.We're expected to be satisfied examining the glue formed between Yomi and blameless Kagura.  Don't get me wrong, it's there, but the creators weren't very creative in showing why they're so close beyond some quick ""You're my sister"" declarations and shared sob stories. To follow that standard ""forming of a bound"" is Yomi's turn to darkness which is about as deep as what George Lucas did with Vader.  A little anger here, accepting the use of some dark power there and where done.  Fight to death!All in all, you know where this is going from start to finish.  This is a good story, good animation, and has some likable characters, but is predictable and leaves nothing to the imagination.  This is still a safe buy and an entertaining viewing experience.  The best news is that it's gone under the radar and hasn't received a lot of support from American audiences so it's a perfect candidate for S.A.V.E.If it slips to S.A.V.E. it will be one of the best titles they have.  It's nowhere close to groundbreaking but I would recommend it without hesitation to most.  This is a good, solid show that doesn't over stay its welcome.  Ga Rei Zero is a safe bet.

But all the while I keep going back to that shocking first episode in my mind, and thinking if they pull off justifying this it would be pretty amazing. Unfortunately, although it was pretty good, I felt the ending didn't come close to balance the previous injustices of the story.

While in itself that is not a bad thing, it is bad in this instance because after two episodes of showing the very near end of the story you are already confused because the two first episodes are very confusing since nothing is really explained as to what is happening. After the first two episodes comes the third which drops you in the very beginning of the story which really confuses you since the beginning is the origin of the characters and how they grow into what they do. Once you get 7-8 episodes into the series it begins to make sense. After watching the series I kinda feel like I have been cheated out of good money because it was criminally short and the first two episodes while action packed and tragic, are repeated later in the series.
