1456845,A1PI8VBCXXSGC7,B005ELVCVQ,Lynn,"[32, 34]","This documentary focuses on Hitler's use of 3D during WWII. He began using 3D photos for propaganda purposes. After all, 3D is impressive...well, I think it is.  There is also a 3D movie clip which might have been used to train  soldiers in the proper use of certain weapons. Later, the Allies began using 3D imagery for aerial reconnaissance.  One of the historians in this documentary is impressed with these WWII, 3D photos & the 3D movie stating that the 3D images help him pick out details that he normally would overlook.  3D wasn't entirely new at that time. Stereoscopic technology has been around  since 1838. I was impressed with the 97 year old Frenchman who has been taking 3D photos for 80 years. Although, Hitler decreed that photography was unlawful, this Frenchman would take photos whenever he was able. (There is an interesting color photo he took of a US soldier).The majority of the photos are black and white. For the most part, the 3D quality of the movie is fine. I saw some crosstalk/ghosting in a few of the old photos.My husband & I found this documentary to be interesting, but not worth $20.  It focuses on 3D and how it was used by Hitler & later, the Allied forces, during WWII. As far as WWII history is concerned, I don't think anything new will be learned from this documentary.",3,"Title should read...
