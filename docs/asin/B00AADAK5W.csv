Films like this one seem to imply that audiences should NOT expect a movie to present a credible plotline. The ending was spectacularly disappointing, completely implausible, and obviously concocted by an idiot. Although other reviewers have spilled some beans, I won't go into details: suffice it to say that it is such a coincidence that Cusack's partner just happens to be, er, intimately involved in this case.

1607188,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B00AADAK5W,C.Wallace,"[10, 11]","At the end of the opening scroll of the cast appears the blurb ""inspired by actual events."" I did a little checking and found that this film is apparently (loosely?) based on the story of Gary Heidnik, who was executed by the state of Pennsylvania in 1999. Heidnik was a serial killer who preyed on prostitutes and brutalized them in a manner similar to that depicted in this film.In the film Dallas Roberts portrays Gary Gemaux, the Heidnik character. John Cusack plays Mike Fletcher, a police detective who became obsessed with solving the case. He had spent a lot of time trying to catch the killer during a three year stretch before the period covered by the film.The film is more than a bit melodramatic. Figuratively speaking, as the conclusion approached, that train is roaring down the track, the damsel is tied to said track, and Detective Fletcher is galloping to the rescue. In the movie, the Heidnik settting is changed, for Fletcher is driving recklessly through the snow-covered streets of a late November in Buffalo.I thought Cusack was solid and basically carried the film. I felt that the other characters were far less convincing.There's a bizarre twist near the end that I did not see coming.  After this strange twist, the film gives us flashbacks of all the clues that we should have spotted.  Yep, the clues were there. Nope, I did not pick up on any of them.The film did keep me engaged, but I cannot give it a strong recommendation.",3,Not Really a Recommendation,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1456,"['end', 'opening', 'scroll', 'cast', 'blurb', 'inspired', 'actual', 'events', 'did', 'little', 'checking', 'found', 'film', 'apparently', 'loosely', 'based', 'story', 'Gary', 'Heidnik', 'who', 'was', 'executed', 'state', 'Pennsylvania', '1999', 'Heidnik', 'was', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'preyed', 'prostitutes', 'brutalized', 'manner', 'similar', 'depicted', 'film.In', 'film', 'Dallas', 'Roberts', 'Gary', 'Gemaux', 'Heidnik', 'character', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Mike', 'Fletcher', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'became', 'obsessed', 'solving', 'case', 'had', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'trying', 'catch', 'killer', 'three', 'year', 'stretch', 'period', 'covered', 'film.The', 'film', 'more', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'Figuratively', 'speaking', 'conclusion', 'approached', 'train', 'roaring', 'down', 'track', 'damsel', 'tied', 'said', 'track', 'Detective', 'Fletcher', 'galloping', 'rescue', 'movie', 'Heidnik', 'settting', 'changed', 'Fletcher', 'driving', 'recklessly', 'snow-covered', 'streets', 'late', 'November', 'Buffalo.I', 'thought', 'Cusack', 'was', 'solid', 'basically', 'carried', 'film', 'felt', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'far', 'less', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'strange', 'twist', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'clues', 'should', 'have', 'spotted', 'Yep', 'clues', 'were', 'there', 'Nope', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'them.The', 'film', 'did', 'keep', 'engaged', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'strong', 'recommendation']",The Factory

Set in Buffalo, NY - which must have one of the worst police departments in history according to this film - it's a miserable tale of abducted prostitutes and the obsessive cop who tries to track them down. Apart from the cliche of the obsessive cop, needless to say his daughter also gets abducted by the same guy. Jennifer Carpenter plays Debra Morgan and is likely to get typecast in this role forever.It's a dark movie that's almost too dark for its own good, where the clues generally don't lead anywhere and eventually the way the killer is found is ridiculous. There's a twist at the end which is one of the most absurd I've seen in a long time (they spice it up with flashbacks of the hints like they're remaking the ending of The Sixth Sense). None of the cops knows how to call for back up and amid the abduction, sexual abuse and general aura of violence, there's a fat guy who gets called fat is about half of his scenes.After nearly two hours of this, you'll feel like you need a shower.

There isn't much violence, but the tone is disturbing and the activities at the bad guy's lair may be hard to stomach for those not well-versed in torture porn.

Not sure if it did or not, but I can believe it when I see some of the stars and then check out their ages.  Of course looks in a movie can be deceiving.  This is movie is about a nut job played by Dallas Roberts (The Walking Dead) who kidnaps young women so he can impregnate them to start a family.  Been there, seen that, you are probably saying, but still worth watching.  He is being chased by a police officer played by John Cusack and his partner played by Jennifer Carpenter who also played Emily Rose in The Exorcism of Emily Rose  and is also in Dexter.  John's wife is played by Sonya Walger who played Sally Harper in the American version of Coupling back in 2003, which by the way sucked when compared to the outstanding BBC version.  She was also in Lost.  John's daughter is played by Mae Whitman and she just happens to get herself kidnapped by the very person her father is looking for.  She was also in The Perks of Being A Wallflower.  When she is kidnapped, she ends up in the basement with two other young girls, one played by Katherine Waterson who appeared in The Babysitters back in 2007.  The other is Mageina Tovah who appeared in American Horror Story and Scandal.  During his investigation, John goes to see a hooker played by none other than the beautiful Ksenia Solo who plays Kenzi in the hit series Lost Girl.  Unfortunately, her part is much too short, but well done and she is blonde unlike Kenzi who has dark hair.  Cindy Sampson plays an undercover cop posing as a hooker.  She had a much bigger part in the series Supernatural, but she does a great job with what she has to work with.  This show has been rated low by some and a bit higher by others, but not being a film critic, I would give it a passing grade.  I look to see if it has people I like, a decent story, and can it hold my attention for 90 plus minutes and this one did that.  Also, it does have a surprise ending, which was not at all what I expected.

When Abby (Mae Whitman), Mike's prostitute looking daughter, becomes the latest missing victim, Mike crosses the line to find her.First off, I love John Cusack, but he is no Liam Neeson. This doesn't have the action level or intensity of ""Taken"", or even ""Taken 2."" We watch as Mike tries to locate his daughter as well as we see his daughter being ""cared for,"" so there is no feel of urgency for the audience as there is for Mike who is trying to piece things together. There is also a flashback sequence that pops up from time to time. This ties to a twist which made the film er, um...silly.The movie is a ""B"" grade crime/drama/thriller. Might work as a rental. Soundtrack played ""Shuffle off to Buffalo"" for no apparent reason other than the fact it has the word ""Buffalo"" in it.

Mike Fletcher (Cusack) believes they are dealing with a serial killer but none of the bodies have ever been found.  However after several years of no new leads the investigation has grown cold and is about to be shut down.  That is until another young girl disappears to make the investigation personal for Fletcher when his own teenage daughter Abby comes up missing.As Mike and Kelsey Walker (Carpenter) desperately chase down every lead possible, Abby finds herself trapped with several other young women in the basement dungeon of a psychopath named Gary who turns his captives into his own cult-like family.  He forces them to have sex with him so they can give him children, keeping them drugged and brainwashed into calling him ""Daddy"".Gary is played by Dallas Roberts who most people know from The Walking Dead as the scientist Milton Mamet who works with the Governor.  Roberts' performance is sneaky effective, hitting just the right notes of Manson-like craziness yet still maintaining enough poise to keep his cover as a food service worker in a nearby hospital.  Cusack is normally known for lighter roles but does a nice job here as a cop who is obsessed with finding the psychopath even before his daughter went missing.  Carpenter plays a toned down, less bombastic version of her character of Debra Morgan from Dexter.  Only Mae Whitman as Abby seems to be in a little over her head although she's a veteran young actress who has been around for nearly 20 years.The Factory was shot in 2011 but never received a theatrical release.

1607232,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00AADAK5W,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","Crime dramas that are based on a true story are always the best kind of crime dramas, because it really is impossible to make up some of the bizzare things that go on inside the criminal mind. The Factory follows the investigation into the disappearance of prostitutes in Buffalo, New York, that takes a personal turn when one of the detectives daughters is abducted. John Cusack plays the lead detective and is terrific as always, this guy is so intense in everything that he does, from a dark crime drama like this to a comedy like Hot Tub Time Machine, Cusack always puts it all on the line and the viewers really do appreciate it. He's paired with a young, beautiful partner played by Jennifer Carpenter who feeds off the veteran actor to give a strong performance herself. This movie was a textbook crime drama, that followed both the investigation into the suspect, as well as the activities of the suspect. It was a tremendous story, but what I didn't like is that you knew exactly who the suspect was and where he worked right from the beginning of the film, there was no mystery too it, but the writer makes up for that with a twist in the end that I promise you won't see coming. The twist is jaw dropping and probably right from the true story, but for me, it kind of ruined the film. The Factory was great up until that point, and while I was shocked over what happened, it wasn't exactly what I wanted to see happen. Sometimes you don't know what's going to happen, but you have in your mind the way you want the story to end, and when the film all of a sudden goes in a completely different direction at the very end, you start to wonder if you didn't see it sooner, because it just wasn't written well enough. It's a very cool movie, albeit a little creepy. The Factory has some great performances and is definitely worth seeing, despite the fact that it leaves you craving something different.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1909,"['Crime', 'dramas', 'are', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'are', 'always', 'best', 'kind', 'crime', 'dramas', 'really', 'impossible', 'make', 'up', 'bizzare', 'things', 'go', 'criminal', 'mind', 'Factory', 'investigation', 'disappearance', 'prostitutes', 'Buffalo', 'New', 'York', 'personal', 'turn', 'when', 'one', 'detectives', 'daughters', 'abducted', 'John', 'Cusack', 'lead', 'detective', 'terrific', 'always', 'guy', 'so', 'intense', 'everything', 'dark', 'crime', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Cusack', 'always', 'line', 'viewers', 'really', 'do', 'appreciate', 'paired', 'young', 'beautiful', 'partner', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'veteran', 'actor', 'give', 'strong', 'performance', 'herself', 'movie', 'was', 'textbook', 'crime', 'drama', 'followed', 'investigation', 'suspect', 'as', 'well', 'activities', 'suspect', 'was', 'tremendous', 'story', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'knew', 'exactly', 'who', 'suspect', 'was', 'where', 'worked', 'right', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'mystery', 'too', 'writer', 'up', 'twist', 'end', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'twist', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'probably', 'right', 'true', 'story', 'kind', 'ruined', 'film', 'Factory', 'was', 'great', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'shocked', 'over', 'what', 'happened', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', 'happen', 'Sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'have', 'mind', 'way', 'want', 'story', 'end', 'when', 'film', 'sudden', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'very', 'end', 'start', 'wonder', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'sooner', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'well', 'enough', 'very', 'cool', 'movie', 'little', 'creepy', 'Factory', 'great', 'performances', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fact', 'craving', 'something', 'different']",The Factory

Mike Fletcher (Cusack) is a cop who has been looking for a serial killer (Roberts) for a long time with no luck. He and his partner are doing everything they can until his daughter winds up missing. Then it becomes personal and Fletcher will stop at nothing to find her. This is a movie that is hard to review. The acting is actually very good in this, Dallas Roberts is especially creepy. The big problem is that the movie feels jerky, for ten minutes you are really interested and excited, then twenty minutes of repetition that makes you lose interest, then it picks back up then slows down. I have said before that many movies work better as TV shows, this is a perfect example of that. For Cusak to be in a movie like this it surprises me.

Apparently she is abducted by the same person responsible for the unsolved serial kidnapping case in the town. &#8220;Inspired by actual events,&#8221; &#8220;The Factory&#8221; attempts to be a suspenseful psychological thriller, but ends up with a rather elaborate and silly one.The biggest problem of &#8220;The Factory&#8221; is the lack of emotional connection to the leading character and his family. John Cusack does what he can do here, but for all the anger and pain the talented actor expresses, Cusack&#8217;s character Mike seems rather emotionally detached. We do not know much about his family; we do not really know about Abby except that she wants to meet her boyfriend.Mike works with his partner Kelsey Walker (Jennifer Carpenter), but we are not very interested in their investigations. We are not allowed to know much about the missing women. We know who the antagonist is in the first five minutes (his name is Gary, reference to the real-life crime upon which the film is loosely based). There is no credible description about the father-daughter relationship. Mike&#8217;s investigation is often interrupted by another storyline about what happened to his daughter Abby. The narrative constantly switches back and forth between two storylines rather mechanically, without raising tension. This is something that is pretty underwhelming.As to the conclusion, all I can say is that director Morgan O'Neill tries too hard to impress.
