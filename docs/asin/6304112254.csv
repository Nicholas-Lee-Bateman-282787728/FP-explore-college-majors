One of her relatives dies and she is held responsible for looking after and raising Elizabeth, a cute little girl who forever changes the life of J.C. Wyatt (Keaton). The film also stars a young and conniving business associate James Spader and Sam Shepard who plays a potential love interest for J.C. halfway through the film after J.C. deicides to leave her high-paying job and move to the ""quiet"" country, a place she has always dreamt of living.

Diane Keaton plays a very successful advertising agent in a large firm.  But there is a glitch when she &#34;inherits&#34; a baby from a distant relative who dies. Of course, learning how to  juggle a baby and career does not go over well with her bosses.  She is gradually demoted as a cloy to get her to quit.  So, she does and moves to Vermont.  She creates gourmet baby food which is wildly successful nationwide.  Of course, her prior agency tries to woo her back with money, etc. saying they could help her better with distribution, etc.  After they overwhelm her with a stunning amount of money and perks, she realizes she likes living in Vermont and having her baby with her without having to worry about office politics.  She sticks it out and the company is a success with her as the sole owner. Warm fuzzy and it gently hits a female nerve that women are penalized for having babies and not being able to hold their high level jobs. You root for her all the way.

402327,A12YVS06GZEFZE,6304112254,Barbara Farr Kelley,"[7, 11]","I'm not much of a Diane Keaton fan.  In fact, I have not liked any of her movies, except Baby Boom.  This was a miracle movie about a woman who was married to her job, sleeping with a man who was married to his job, and not  interested in getting married on paper to each other.  Keaton had no  parenting skills, had never even held a baby.  You could tell that when she  carried Baby Elizabeth under her armpit into the restaurant right after  receiving her off the airplane.Needless to say, she fell in love with  this little girl after she helped nurse her back to health after a cold.  She couldn't even give her up at the adoption agency.  Therefore, she lost  her so-called boyfriend because he didn't like kids.Things got better  and worse at the same time.  She loved her job, people even called her The  Tiger Lady because she worked more hours than she relaxed.  But as she was  becoming more accustomed to being a mommy, she was slowly phased out of her  accounts by corporate rats, mainly played by James Spader, &quot;the little  pischer&quot; as J.C. Wyatt called him.  He'd still be selling shirts at  Barney's if she had not brought him under her wing.  Well, the little  pischer got her main account, The Food Chain, and because she couldn't  think about being known as being down-sized to the dogfood account, she  quit.She moves to this really cool country estate in Vermont with 62  acres of land, a pond, cows, and a two story house with an attic that is in  need of constant repair.  The house looks like a dream on the outside, but  on the inside she winds up paying thousands to put on a new roof, get the  heating fixed, and she even runs out of well water.The well water part  is funny, because being a city girl, she thinks she can just go get the  hose around the back of the house and fill up the well.  She is totally  unaware that she's going to have to spend thousands more to get her house  hooked up to the town's water supply.  Poor thing!  I'm a city girl, too,  but not so much of a city girl that if I ran out of well water I'd know I  was completely out of water.She meets and falls in love with the little  country veterinarian played by Sam Sheppard.  I'm not much of a Sam  Sheppard fan, either, but this is one of the movies I loved him in.He  was so good with Baby Elizabeth, and he practically kissed the frozen toes  off Diane Keaton when she had a flat on the way home one night.  &quot;Wow!&quot; she whispers, after he leaves.While she spends day  after dreary day in her snow-bound Vermont home, she creates a homemade  baby food recipe for Elizabeth out of the apple orchard.  Homemade baby  applesauce.  And it becomes such a big seller that now the big city wants  to get their clutches into the recipe.  So J.C. goes back to the big city  to make a deal with them.  But even though they offer her 3 million dollars  up front, an apartment of her choice, a portion of the profits, and use of  the company jet, she turns them down, because she realizes that she loves  her country estate, and her baby is so happy there, and she's in love with  the town vet.I really like the way this movie ended.  I just wish the  series with Kate Jackson would have taken up where the movie left off,  instead of her being a corporate executive.  The series wasn't very good,  and I really, really, like Kate Jackson, but Diane Keaton was type-cast in  this role, and if she had been in the series, maybe it would have gone  over.Ahhh, well, I'm probably past my thousand word limit, so here's  sayin', if you have not seen Baby Boom, you need to buy a copy.

The movie shows its age, but is still a warm pleasant feel good film.Rewind to 1987, Diane Keaton plays J.C. the definition of a New York yuppie. Her whole life is her work and getting ahead. The film takes exactly the right amount of time defining her and her job. Her life is turned upside down when a baby is unexpectedly mixed into her life. It quickly moves forward to how much Elizabeth turns her life upside down.The film wears the 80's on its shoulder pads and big hair. Diane Keaton is in her prime, confident and gorgeous. The baby Elizabeth is the cutest kid ever in a film. James Spader is perfect as the slimy new young up and coming executive that wants J. C.'s job. Some of the things said by J. C.'s boss (Sam Wanamaker) wouldn't be tolerated today and were on the cusp of being offensive in the late 80's. It was fun to look at what was high tech and high style in the 80's. There was no internet, no email, very few computers, and no cell phones. If nothing else, the film is a great look at that era.The film is just about the right length at two hours long. It is clearly divided into three acts. It doesn't suffer from the mid-movie change of pace so many movies have. The film slips fluidly between New York yuppie and Vermont farm country.Baby Boom is a warm good look back at the 1980's.

402342,A31LHED3SKLWVB,6304112254,Darren,"[0, 0]","Sort of a check-up on how Women's Lib was holding up after about 20 years.  Writer Nancy Meyers indicated in 1987's &#34;Baby Boom&#34; that all the busted glass ceilings were coming with a cost, and female audiences must have agreed, as this was a pretty big hit that even spawned a brief network TV spinoff.  In fact, the idea of a fulfilling work and family life as depicted in this movie, without one coming at the expense of the other, was no mere pipe dream, but a demand at the ballot box.  To take just one example: the Family Medical Leave Act signed by Bill Clinton six years after this movie was released reflects Americans' priorities on the subject.  And when do people most often use FMLA?  For bonding time with new babies.All of which is not to say that &#34;Baby Boom&#34; didn't come in for its fair share of criticism from feminists who resented what they thought was creeping &#34;back-to-the-kitchen&#34; chauvinism, made all the worse, in their view, by having Seventies icon Diane Keaton playing the lead.  But writer (and sometimes director, though not here) Meyers -- one of a handful of true auteurs remaining in the current blighted Hollywood -- has always been a bit too deft in her messaging for the comfort of critics who are encumbered with boulders on their shoulders.  (The feminist message of her &#34;Private Benjamin&#34; also slipped past these socially aware critics, probably because it had cutie-pie Goldie Hawn in the lead.)  I won't describe the plot in detail, but let's just say that Keaton arrives at success on her own precise terms, without abandoning the child that she has come to love dearly or selling out the integrity of her business.  As as man, I might be on the outside looking in here, but I would call that ending a feminist success story.  I think more legitimate criticisms could be leveled at the overly diagrammed plot.  &#34;Tiger Lady&#34; New York business-shark finds baby on doorstep, doesn't know how to change diapers, gets too distracted for her high-powered job ... you can almost hear the wheels grinding and the narrative blocks clanging into perfect place, and in fact you can predict each new crisis before it arrives.  And you know she'll get a love interest -- who else but lanky Sam Shepard with his affected Texas drawl (in Vermont), certainly an upgrade from Six-Minute-Man Harold Ramis from her old life.  Despite the contemporary problems being gently diagnosed, the movie actually feels like something from the Forties.  At one point, newspaper headlines spin into view about Keaton's new baby-food business.  Meyers, like everyone else, has deeply absorbed the old Hollywood cliches.The movie mostly works because of the dependably excellent Keaton, who is convincingly hard-edged in the boardroom, clearly has an off-screen soft spot for the fat-faced toddler she works with, and brings her considerable comic chops to bear in order to not only sell the character but to make us like her and want her to succeed.  The scene where she melts down in front of the local &#34;yup-and-nope&#34; handyman, who is on his fifth visit to her dilapidated Vermont Dream-House, is a high-point of both the movie and Keaton's career.  4 stars out of 5.",4,Having it all,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,3224,"['Sort', 'check-up', 'how', 'Women', 'Lib', 'was', 'holding', 'up', '20', 'years', 'Writer', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'indicated', '1987', '34', 'Baby', 'Boom', '34', 'busted', 'glass', 'ceilings', 'were', 'coming', 'cost', 'female', 'audiences', 'must', 'have', 'agreed', 'was', 'pretty', 'big', 'hit', 'even', 'spawned', 'brief', 'network', 'TV', 'spinoff', 'fact', 'idea', 'fulfilling', 'work', 'family', 'life', 'depicted', 'movie', 'one', 'coming', 'expense', 'other', 'was', 'mere', 'pipe', 'dream', 'demand', 'ballot', 'box', 'take', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'Family', 'Medical', 'Leave', 'Act', 'signed', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'six', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Americans', 'priorities', 'subject', 'when', 'do', 'people', 'most', 'often', 'use', 'FMLA', 'bonding', 'time', 'new', 'babies.All', 'not', 'say', '34', 'Baby', 'Boom', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'fair', 'share', 'criticism', 'feminists', 'who', 'resented', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'creeping', '34', 'back-to-the-kitchen', '34', 'chauvinism', 'made', 'worse', 'view', 'having', 'Seventies', 'icon', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'playing', 'lead', 'writer', 'sometimes', 'director', 'not', 'here', 'Meyers', 'one', 'handful', 'true', 'auteurs', 'remaining', 'current', 'blighted', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'too', 'deft', 'messaging', 'comfort', 'critics', 'who', 'are', 'encumbered', 'boulders', 'shoulders', 'feminist', 'message', '34', 'Private', 'Benjamin', '34', 'also', 'slipped', 'socially', 'aware', 'critics', 'probably', 'had', 'cutie-pie', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'lead', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'plot', 'detail', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Keaton', 'success', 'own', 'precise', 'terms', 'abandoning', 'child', 'come', 'love', 'dearly', 'selling', 'out', 'integrity', 'business', 'man', 'might', 'be', 'outside', 'looking', 'here', 'would', 'call', 'ending', 'feminist', 'success', 'story', 'think', 'more', 'legitimate', 'criticisms', 'could', 'be', 'leveled', 'overly', 'diagrammed', 'plot', '34', 'Tiger', 'Lady', '34', 'New', 'York', 'business-shark', 'finds', 'baby', 'doorstep', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'change', 'diapers', 'too', 'distracted', 'high-powered', 'job', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'wheels', 'grinding', 'narrative', 'blocks', 'clanging', 'perfect', 'place', 'fact', 'can', 'predict', 'new', 'crisis', 'know', ""'ll"", 'get', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'else', 'lanky', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'affected', 'Texas', 'drawl', 'Vermont', 'certainly', 'upgrade', 'Six-Minute-Man', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'old', 'life', 'contemporary', 'problems', 'being', 'gently', 'diagnosed', 'movie', 'actually', 'feels', 'something', 'Forties', 'one', 'point', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'spin', 'view', 'Keaton', 'new', 'baby-food', 'business', 'Meyers', 'everyone', 'else', 'deeply', 'absorbed', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'cliches.The', 'movie', 'mostly', 'dependably', 'excellent', 'Keaton', 'who', 'convincingly', 'hard-edged', 'boardroom', 'clearly', 'off-screen', 'soft', 'spot', 'fat-faced', 'toddler', 'considerable', 'comic', 'chops', 'bear', 'order', 'not', 'only', 'sell', 'character', 'make', 'want', 'succeed', 'scene', 'where', 'melts', 'down', 'front', 'local', '34', 'yup-and-nope', '34', 'handyman', 'who', 'fifth', 'visit', 'dilapidated', 'Vermont', 'Dream-House', 'high-point', 'movie', 'Keaton', 'career', '4', 'stars', '5']",N/A

402356,A3HETHW2XD3DWH,6304112254,frisky2000,"[14, 15]","Sorry some reviewers thought this movie was a waste of time -- not every Diane Keaton film can be an Oscar winner.  Baby Boom, however, succeeds in touching the heart of anyone who has had such a driven and hectic corporate career that the notion of burping a bouncing baby on your lap is as foreign as learning to write backwards!When J.C. Wyatt, a successful ad executive, ""inherits"" baby Elizabeth after an unfortunate accident claims the baby's parents (J.C.'s cousin), she is forced to manage the demands of runny noses, changing diapers (what a great scene where she actually reads the directions on the package to figure out how to put the diaper on!) along with the cut throat corporate climbers in the male-dominated world of advertising.There are scenes so heartwarming it will bring tears to your eyes, like when J.C. falls asleep cuddling baby Elizabeth when she is sick, or when the prospective adoptive parents are so rigid and heartless that they aren't ""getting a boy"" it sends J.C. flying out the door, baby in tow, ready to give it another try.  Even if you are not a parent, you will appreciate J.C.'s hysteria over finding the right babysitter, the proper medicine, and just about every toy known to toddlers.James Spader is the sly fox colleague who steals J.C.'s accounts out from under her before she makes the decision to leave New York City behind and settle into a Vermont ""dream house"" with Elizabeth.  After numerous mishaps with the house, nearly going broke on repairs and battling a brutal Northern winter, J.C. stumbles upon a golden idea to sell her homemade baby food to the local shops.  Alas she is financially on top again, and really loving being a mom.  She meets and falls for the town vet, learns to love the ""simple life"" and makes her new life a success all its own....till Manhattan calls upon her once again to wimpishly try winning her back.True to form, J.C. accepts a business meeting where the stuffy suits offer her a fortune to take over her Country Baby label.There's really no giving away anything in this movie since it's all very predictable, but it's still sweet and heartwarming, and you'll love the precious little actress cast as Elizabeth.Baby Boom is an old favorite, and good fun for new parents, especially when they're fresh out of their corporate career modes.*Favorite Movie Quote: ""I can't have a baby, I have a 12 o'clock lunch meeting....!!""",4,Endearingly touching,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,2410,"['Sorry', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'not', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Baby', 'Boom', 'however', 'touching', 'heart', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'such', 'driven', 'hectic', 'corporate', 'career', 'notion', 'burping', 'bouncing', 'baby', 'lap', 'as', 'foreign', 'learning', 'write', 'backwards', 'When', 'J.C.', 'Wyatt', 'successful', 'ad', 'executive', 'inherits', 'baby', 'Elizabeth', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'baby', 'parents', 'J.C.', 'cousin', 'forced', 'manage', 'demands', 'runny', 'noses', 'changing', 'diapers', 'what', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'actually', 'directions', 'package', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'put', 'diaper', 'cut', 'throat', 'corporate', 'climbers', 'male-dominated', 'world', 'advertising.There', 'are', 'scenes', 'so', 'heartwarming', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'when', 'J.C.', 'asleep', 'cuddling', 'baby', 'Elizabeth', 'when', 'sick', 'when', 'prospective', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'are', 'so', 'rigid', 'heartless', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'boy', 'J.C.', 'flying', 'out', 'door', 'baby', 'tow', 'ready', 'give', 'try', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'parent', 'will', 'appreciate', 'J.C.', 'hysteria', 'finding', 'right', 'babysitter', 'proper', 'medicine', 'just', 'toy', 'known', 'toddlers.James', 'Spader', 'sly', 'fox', 'colleague', 'who', 'J.C.', 'accounts', 'decision', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'settle', 'Vermont', 'dream', 'house', 'Elizabeth', 'numerous', 'mishaps', 'house', 'nearly', 'going', 'broke', 'repairs', 'battling', 'brutal', 'Northern', 'winter', 'J.C.', 'golden', 'idea', 'sell', 'homemade', 'baby', 'food', 'local', 'shops', 'Alas', 'financially', 'top', 'again', 'really', 'loving', 'being', 'mom', 'town', 'vet', 'love', 'simple', 'life', 'new', 'life', 'success', 'own', '.till', 'Manhattan', 'once', 'again', 'wimpishly', 'try', 'winning', 'back.True', 'form', 'J.C.', 'business', 'meeting', 'where', 'stuffy', 'suits', 'offer', 'fortune', 'take', 'over', 'Country', 'Baby', 'really', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', 'movie', 'very', 'predictable', 'still', 'sweet', 'heartwarming', ""'ll"", 'love', 'precious', 'little', 'actress', 'cast', 'Elizabeth.Baby', 'Boom', 'old', 'favorite', 'good', 'fun', 'new', 'parents', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'fresh', 'corporate', 'career', 'modes', '*Favorite', 'Movie', 'Quote', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'baby', 'have', '12', ""o'clock"", 'lunch', 'meeting']",N/A

402359,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6304112254,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Chalk it up to ""It's just one of those things"" but, for whatever reason, I hadn't much ran into films featuring Diane Keaton. I just now saw BABY BOOM, never mind that I'd been aware of it peripherally since its box office release back in 1987. For the umpteenth time, I remind myself to check out more of this actress's work. BABY BOOM kept my eyeballs locked on the telly screen.J.C. Wiatt (Keaton) perches on top of the food chain. She is a ruthless boardroom executive. J.C. Wiatt graduated with top honors in Yale, earned an MBA from Harvard. Her salary runs six figures a year. Her Manhattan corner office overlooks the corner of 58th and Park. And she's about to make partner. So when her barely recollected cousin, whom she hadn't seen since 1954, dies in an accident and bequeaths his 13-month-old girl to her care, J.C. Wiatt isn't exactly brimming over with familial resolve.BABY BOOM starts out as a caustic satire on corporate ambition, and so I settled in, anticipating a film rife with edgy observations. There's also that good sub-text that factors in a woman in the role of corporate shark. J.C. Wiatt is a workaholic, punching in twelve to fourteen hours a day. She lives for the thrill of the kill, the satisfaction of landing the big account. Her unexpected inheritance threatens to upend her lifestyle. She quickly learns how hard it is to juggle abrupt motherhood and a demanding career. But, damn, that surely is one cute and very agreeable baby (played by Kristina & Michelle Kennedy).It's farfetched that J.C. and her lived-in beau (Harold Ramis), even as ignorant of child care as they are, would feed the baby gourmet pasta. We're treated to fun gags like J.C.'s applying electrical tape to secure the baby's diapers and J.C.'s checking the baby in at the restaurant coat check room as she heads in for her power lunch. But the baby is so adorable, it's inevitable that J.C. grows to love her. In that instance, the tone shifts from wicked satire to something more sweet and fuzzy wuzzy and Frank Capraesque. Don't get me twisted, BABY BOOM is entertaining from start to finish, although you may have to tweak your mindset. There's juicy fun in watching Diane Keaton play the hard-charging executive but then downshift to caring mom and frustrated, weepy woman. James Spader pops in and does his patented slimy yuppie routine. Sam Shepard enters late in the game as Keaton's potential love interest. What? You didn't think Harold Ramis had it in him, did you? It's freakin' Harold Ramis.The film takes great pains to shelter Keaton's character from the harsh realities of the world. And maybe that's the one glaring hole in the narrative. The earlier Frank Capra reference wasn't dropped in 'cause I was going for the champion film buff trophy. Huge chunks of BABY BOOM come off like a fairy tale. ***SPOILER ALERT now for this 1987 comedy*** Keaton's character doesn't sacrifice anything by turning her back on her career to become a mom. In fact, her life-altering decision paves the way for her gaining even wilder success. See, a modern woman can have it all, the career, the baby, the romance. Or maybe it's only Diane Keaton who can do this.",4,"""I just think the rat race is gonna have to survive with one less rat.""",1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,3174,"['Chalk', 'just', 'one', 'things', 'reason', 'had', ""n't"", 'much', 'ran', 'films', 'featuring', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'just', 'now', 'saw', 'BABY', 'BOOM', 'never', 'mind', ""'d"", 'been', 'aware', 'peripherally', 'box', 'office', 'release', 'back', '1987', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'remind', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'actress', 'work', 'BABY', 'BOOM', 'kept', 'eyeballs', 'locked', 'telly', 'screen.J.C', 'Wiatt', 'Keaton', 'top', 'food', 'chain', 'ruthless', 'boardroom', 'executive', 'J.C.', 'Wiatt', 'graduated', 'top', 'honors', 'Yale', 'earned', 'MBA', 'Harvard', 'salary', 'runs', 'six', 'figures', 'year', 'Manhattan', 'corner', 'office', 'corner', '58th', 'Park', 'make', 'partner', 'So', 'when', 'barely', 'recollected', 'cousin', 'whom', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', '1954', 'accident', 'bequeaths', '13-month-old', 'girl', 'care', 'J.C.', 'Wiatt', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'brimming', 'familial', 'resolve.BABY', 'BOOM', 'out', 'caustic', 'satire', 'corporate', 'ambition', 'so', 'settled', 'anticipating', 'film', 'rife', 'edgy', 'observations', 'also', 'good', 'sub-text', 'factors', 'woman', 'role', 'corporate', 'shark', 'J.C.', 'Wiatt', 'workaholic', 'punching', 'twelve', 'fourteen', 'hours', 'day', 'thrill', 'kill', 'satisfaction', 'landing', 'big', 'account', 'unexpected', 'inheritance', 'threatens', 'upend', 'lifestyle', 'quickly', 'how', 'hard', 'juggle', 'abrupt', 'motherhood', 'demanding', 'career', 'damn', 'surely', 'one', 'cute', 'very', 'agreeable', 'baby', 'played', 'Kristina', 'Michelle', 'Kennedy', '.It', 'farfetched', 'J.C.', 'lived-in', 'beau', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'even', 'ignorant', 'child', 'care', 'are', 'would', 'feed', 'baby', 'gourmet', 'pasta', ""'re"", 'treated', 'fun', 'gags', 'J.C.', 'applying', 'electrical', 'tape', 'secure', 'baby', 'diapers', 'J.C.', 'checking', 'baby', 'restaurant', 'coat', 'check', 'room', 'power', 'lunch', 'baby', 'so', 'adorable', 'inevitable', 'J.C.', 'love', 'instance', 'tone', 'shifts', 'wicked', 'satire', 'something', 'more', 'sweet', 'fuzzy', 'wuzzy', 'Frank', 'Capraesque', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'twisted', 'BABY', 'BOOM', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish', 'may', 'have', 'tweak', 'mindset', 'juicy', 'fun', 'watching', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'play', 'hard-charging', 'executive', 'then', 'downshift', 'caring', 'mom', 'frustrated', 'weepy', 'woman', 'James', 'Spader', 'pops', 'patented', 'slimy', 'yuppie', 'routine', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'enters', 'late', 'game', 'Keaton', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'had', 'did', 'freakin', 'Harold', 'Ramis.The', 'film', 'great', 'pains', 'shelter', 'Keaton', 'character', 'harsh', 'realities', 'world', 'maybe', 'one', 'glaring', 'hole', 'narrative', 'earlier', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'reference', 'was', ""n't"", 'dropped', ""'cause"", 'was', 'going', 'champion', 'film', 'buff', 'trophy', 'Huge', 'chunks', 'BABY', 'BOOM', 'come', 'off', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ALERT', 'now', '1987', 'comedy***', 'Keaton', 'character', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'anything', 'turning', 'back', 'career', 'become', 'mom', 'fact', 'life-altering', 'decision', 'way', 'gaining', 'even', 'wilder', 'success', 'See', 'modern', 'woman', 'can', 'have', 'career', 'baby', 'romance', 'only', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'can', 'do']",N/A

She's never disappointed me in any of her movies, counting this one. Keaton's character, J.C. Wiatt, shows a fabulous transition from a tiger lady to a doting mother.  My favorite scenes were the ones in the airport, when Wiatt first learns she has a baby on her hands, when she yells at the plumber at the well, when she confesses all her problems to the vet (Shepard), when Shepard rescues her, and finally the ending- it's so sweet and so unpredictable. This movie emits warm vibes,and is a must-see during a snowy night with the lights turned off. The only complaints I have about this movie is that Shepard's character should have shown a little more emphasis on what he should have been doing. I excepted him to be a witty,teasing character. And while he is, it isn't seen very well. I wanted more conversations between those two, a little vulnerability.

The career woman with skirt suits, wide shoulder pads, bow-tied blouses, and pointed heels with a baby on one hip and lugging a briefcase was ME !  Of course, I didn't acquire my baby as a result of a bequeath from a distant relative; but nevertheless I could relate to trying to keep the career going while attempting to find reliable daycare and being taken seriously at the office. Diane Keaton is at her lovable best with all her quirks and habits as the committed workaholic career woman at the top of her game - until she acquires a beautiful baby girl from a distant relation. She decided immediately to put the baby up for adoption, but suddenly changed her mind when she saw the decidedly low class couple that was slated to adopt her; she knew she could give baby Elizabeth a better life.The baby Elizabeth was perfectly cast (played by twin girls) and was utterly adorable. After getting squeezed out of the major project JC (Keaton) was destined to manage, she quits her high powered job in NYC in a fit of pique and buys an old house with property in Vermont. The maintenance problems suck up all of her cash, and she turns to making baby food (applesauce) to fill her time and make a little money and fill her idle hours. After some visiting yuppies snap up multiple jars of the ""Country Baby"" sauce at a local gift shop, she alights on the idea of promoting the brand more widely. She also meets the hunky local veterinarian, Sam Shepard, (the only man under 50 in the whole area). Of course, since she's an aggressive, high-powered businesswoman, her venture soon becomes a huge success.

To give you a sense, there are separate montages to depict her home business booming and her acclimating to country life that could of easily been rolled into one. Then there are multiple separate scenes that communicate the idea that the company is slowly replacing her because of her lack of focus. They could of had one scene do this.

Keaton portrays J.C. Wiatt, a Management Consultant who never stops working.  Then she finds out that her cousin, in his will, left her his baby daughter Elizabeth (played by Michelle and Christine Kennedy, who are too cute!) to care for.  At first, J.C. does not want to have anything to do with having a baby.  She's too wrapped up in work.  The turning point to me is when Elizabeth gets sick and J.C. has to care for her.  It is then that you can tell that she starts to bond with Elizabeth.  Unfortunately, Steven (Harold Ramis), the man who she lives with, doesn't agree with this situation and leaves.  Eventually, J.C. finds herself paying more attention to Elizabeth than with work which does not make her boss (Sam Wanamaker) too happy.  He decides to lower J.C.'s status in the company and promotes Ken (James Spader) to her status.  J.C. decides that she should move.  Also, the transformation Diane makes from full-time worker to full-time mom is great.  I do believe that Diane Keaton show her maternal side in this film.  She is so natural with children.What happens next is so sweet.  She moves to this Vermont home where everything you can think of goes wrong, she gets ""yupped"" and ""noped"" by everyone there, and basically goes crazy and vows she will go back to New York.  But then she meets Dr. Cooper (Sam Shepard) and everything slowly changes for her.  As a romance begins, so does another career move for J.C.  She invents 'Gormet Baby Food' which the Food Chain, where she used to work, wants to buy.  The ending is wonderful.  I loved it.

This was before I saw Working Girl even or Look Who's Talking. Which in this case is a little of both movies into one.Diane Keaton plays J.C. Wiatt a hugly successful business woman in the 80's. And works for a huge advertising company. In the process of almost making partner in the company she recieves an inheritence from some cousins she hasn't seen in ages. It turns out it's a baby girl Elizabeth. Now she's conflicted of working but at the same time deciding to give up Elizabeth for being a partner or possibly doing both. She learns that she just can't give up with Elizabeth and she has fallen in love with her. However, she learns it's too hard to work full time in a demanding business and raise a baby girl at the same time.So they move to a country side where quite a few things go wrong. A city girl in the country trying to make it on her own and raising a baby girl. She then starts a business on her own which can land her back at her old business.It's got a great cast with: Diane Keaton who's really amazing in this role, and other's such as: Harold Ramis (Ghostbusters), Sam Shepard (Black Hawk Down), James Spader, and many more noticable stars. In the start of the movie the narrorator is none other than newswoman Linda Ellerbee.The DVD I was a bit disappointed in it's only got a theatrical trailer and not much else.

402408,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6304112254,Reviewer,"[24, 26]","As anyone who has walked a mile or two knows, life is about choices and making decisions.  And a lot of that has to do with realizing and setting priorities, because-- as a wise person once said-- You Can't Have It All.  It's the lesson we all learn in our own way in our own time, according to our own personal situation, and director Charles Shyer examines one of them in his amiable comedy, ""Baby Boom,"" starring Diane Keaton.J.C. Wiatt (Keaton) is a high-powered businesswoman on the fast track to success; she knows what she wants, has set her priorities, and a partnership in the firm for which she works is on the horizon.  Her live-in significant other, Steven (Harold Ramis), is of a like mind-set, so they complement one another's life style perfectly.  Marriage and/or having children is in neither of their respective vocabularies.  then one day, J.C. ""inherits"" a baby, the child of a distant relative (a cousin she'd met only once) who has been killed in a tragic accident, and suddenly, J.C.'s world is turned upside down.  Keeping the baby is out of the question, of course.  Or is it?  For J.C., it just may not be as simple as it seems, initially.  She's been living life on her own terms, but now she is once again faced with choices, decisions and setting priorities.  And along the way, she learns one of life's most important lessons:  The fact that the lesson never ends.There's some amusing moments and some insights to be gleaned from Shyer's film, and overall it's a pleasant, enjoyable experience.  It is not, however, an entirely original idea, and Shyer laces it with stereotypes and cliches to boot.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, though.  If his characters are stereotypical, it's because they reflect a certain realism.  J.C.'s boss, Fritz Curtis (Sam Wanamaker), for instance, typifies the image of a dedicated, hard-core businessman whom you get the feeling has to consult his day planner to work in an appointment with his own family.  A stereotype?  Perhaps.  A reflection of reality?  Definitely.  The same can be said for Sam Shepard's character, Dr. Jeff Cooper, who personifies the general image of one in his situation.  And again, it is a reflection of reality, stereotypical though it may be.Even the cliches are handled in a way that makes them fresh enough to work within the context of the story, and be appreciated-- especially by those in the audience who may have experienced any of the situations presented here.  When J.C. fumbles with a diaper and becomes frustrated with her own inexperience and incompetence with such things, it's cliche, but it also rings true-to-life.  The important thing is, it's all well presented and actually pretty funny stuff, even if it isn't anything new.Shyer wrote the screenplay, along with Nancy Meyers, and one angle they may have failed to cultivate fully has to do with Ken, the character played by James Spader.  As J.C.'s in-house adversary, also striving to climb the corporate ladder, it may have been intrinsically more interesting had the character been a woman.  The fact that Ken is a man, again, makes this particular situation fairly cliche; whereas a competitive conflict with another woman, considering J.C.'s predicament, would have expanded the avenues of possibility to a much greater extent, and certainly would have provided a more imaginative perspective.The main reason the film works as well as it does, however, is because of the engaging performance by Diane Keaton.  In J.C., she creates the antithesis of Annie Hall, but even at her most demanding there is a hint of vulnerability in J.C., a softness to that hard exterior edge she uses to shoulder her way through the business world.  Keaton gives you a real sense of the conflict she's experiencing, and though it's lightheartedly rendered for the most part, you understand the underlying seriousness of it all.  And the scene in which she vents her frustrations and bares her soul to Dr. Cooper is classic.  Keaton's work is without question the highlight of the film, and what really brings it to life.The supporting cast includes Pat Hingle (Hughes Larabee), Britt Leach (Verne), Kim Sebastian (Robin), Mary Gross) Charlotte, Patricia Estrin (Secretary)Victoria Jackson (Eve), Jane Elliot (Park Mom) and Linda Ellerbee (Narrator).  An upbeat, entertaining film, ""Baby Boom"" may not be particularly memorable, but it does provide some laughs, and at the same time says something about the value of being given the opportunity to question the things we ""think"" we want.  Kind of like saying ""Never say never.""  After all, who can say with any certainty where destiny may lead any of us?  It's something a film like this may make you consider, inbetween the chuckles.

Her Tiger Lady is one of the best  caricatures of a shark-like corporate female ever, and her blossoming  softness, courtesy of that adorable baby girl, is a joy to behold.  The  settings, from the hustle-bustle of a cheerfully skewed Manhattan office  and environs, to the Christmas-card perfection (but don't be fooled!) of a  Vermont farmhouse, pull you in, and add color to a predictable but funny  plot.  Sam Shepard lends his trademark subtlety and attractiveness as a  Vermont vet.

Movies where you can see the characters journey.... see what they have gained, substance wise, thru the film?  Well, if so, this is the film for you.  It's a cute tale of a corporate woman who is basically tossed into motherhood.  The story is wonderfully told and full of sentimental value.  And of course Ms. Keaton delivers her best to us as far as the acting is concerned, which is definitely not surprising, she's a wonderful actress.  Never the less, it's not a complicated tale so there's not paragraphs of information to load down but basically its a gentle story of a woman learning about priorities.... and it's not so much that her priorities were mixed up to begin with, but moreso about discovering that there is more to life than what we're use to... and how sometimes what we least want or expect is what ends up bringing us the most joy. This movie is kinda like the acting out of the phrase, ""stop and smell the roses.""  And that's what the main character does.

This film was supposed to show us that family and children are more important than all the money and any career in the world. It was supposed to show some humor, make people laugh, and warm one&#8217;s heart. But it failed to accomplish anything!First of all, she did not transform from business lady to a mother. The movie showed me a bright and sharp working woman who was transformed to a humiliated and miserable creature. She was taken from her regular life style in New York City to this far away country, a forest, were she does not belong, where she does not have anyone. She met there a vet whom she did not like to begin with and who completely had nothing to do with her. But eventually she ""fall in love"" with him ONLY because he was the only single man under sixty around! The character of this guy was absolutely not developed; we are not shown anything about him. He behaved like a piece of wood; he expressed nothing....Because this movie was unable to SHOW us all this. The movie did not show us how she loved Vermont. It did not show us that her baby was happy there. It did not show us clearly that she was a TIGER lady. This why it had explicitly to tell us all this through the voice behind the screen or through her final speech. What a poor job! The plot has too many holes. She purchased a home in VERMONT? She could buy the same house in upstate New York or in Long Island and continue her job in the same company without sacrificing her life style. She could not find a normal baby sitter in New York? Give me a break!This movie deserved only one star for good music. Clearly, the movie does not worth watching or buying. In addition to all that, the DVD picture quality was really bad.
