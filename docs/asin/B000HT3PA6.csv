1016346,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B000HT3PA6,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[25, 25]","Arriving on DVD for the first time on Nov. 7 is the Gregory Peck movie ""The Chairman."" In it Peck plays a scientist who must travel to China to steal a top-secret formula. It's a fast-paced movie that manages to successfully balance post-cultural Revolution China politics, and the cultural divide between East and the West. The final moments as Peck's character attempts to flee over the Chinese border with Russia are filled with tension and excitement.This release includes a rather unusual special feature. Running at 17:32 is a mini-version of the movie using deleted and alternate scenes. It's actually very well done and managed to touch on the majority of key plot points from the full running time version of 98 minutes.There are also two deleted scenes taken from the International version of the movie. Neither adds much to the overall movie and parents should beware, the second deleted scene contains female nudity.Arguably the lead special feature for ""The Chairman"" is an audio commentary conducted by film historians Eddie Friedfeld and Lee Pfeiffer. The two are obviously good friends (both being professors at NYU) and the commentary is very academic in tone, but still engaging. They begin by framing the movie in the context of the Cold War. Other key points in the commentary include discussions on the symbolism in the movie and standards of the spy genre. Included is a discussion of geopolitics specifically the tension between Russia and China as ""The Chairman"" sees the United States and Soviet Union join forces against the Chinese. They also commend the Jerry Goldsmith score and Pfeiffer (a well known and respected 007 fan) comments how the actress playing the Chinese stewardesses on the plane who just happens to be a spy also played a stewardess on a plane who just happened to be a spy in 1964's ""Goldfinger.""These Nov. 7 releases from Fox contains trailers for several other movies, of varying quality. The trailers for ""The Chairman"" for example include not just the one for the feature, but also for ""Our Man Flint,"" ""In Like Flint,"" ""The Quiller Memorandum,"" ""Deadfall,"" ""The Magus"" and ""Peeper."" As might be expected however the trailers do show their age, and not always gracefully.Also included is a quite in-depth collectible booklet.Recommended.",5,Seen an advance copy of this DVD and it's incredible,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,2288,"['Arriving', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'Nov.', '7', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'movie', 'Chairman', 'Peck', 'scientist', 'who', 'must', 'travel', 'China', 'steal', 'top-secret', 'formula', 'fast-paced', 'movie', 'successfully', 'balance', 'post-cultural', 'Revolution', 'China', 'politics', 'cultural', 'divide', 'East', 'West', 'final', 'moments', 'Peck', 'character', 'attempts', 'flee', 'Chinese', 'border', 'Russia', 'are', 'filled', 'tension', 'excitement.This', 'release', 'rather', 'unusual', 'special', 'feature', 'Running', '17:32', 'mini-version', 'movie', 'using', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'managed', 'touch', 'majority', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'full', 'running', 'time', 'version', '98', 'minutes.There', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'taken', 'International', 'version', 'movie', 'much', 'overall', 'movie', 'parents', 'should', 'beware', 'second', 'deleted', 'scene', 'contains', 'female', 'nudity.Arguably', 'lead', 'special', 'feature', 'Chairman', 'audio', 'commentary', 'conducted', 'film', 'historians', 'Eddie', 'Friedfeld', 'Lee', 'Pfeiffer', 'two', 'are', 'obviously', 'good', 'friends', 'being', 'professors', 'NYU', 'commentary', 'very', 'academic', 'tone', 'still', 'engaging', 'begin', 'framing', 'movie', 'context', 'Cold', 'War', 'Other', 'key', 'points', 'commentary', 'include', 'discussions', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'standards', 'spy', 'genre', 'Included', 'discussion', 'geopolitics', 'specifically', 'tension', 'Russia', 'China', 'Chairman', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'join', 'forces', 'Chinese', 'also', 'commend', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'score', 'Pfeiffer', 'well', 'known', 'respected', '007', 'fan', 'comments', 'how', 'actress', 'playing', 'Chinese', 'stewardesses', 'plane', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'spy', 'also', 'played', 'stewardess', 'plane', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'spy', '1964', 'Goldfinger', 'Nov.', '7', 'releases', 'Fox', 'trailers', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'varying', 'quality', 'trailers', 'Chairman', 'example', 'include', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'feature', 'also', 'Man', 'Flint', 'Flint', 'Quiller', 'Memorandum', 'Deadfall', 'Magus', 'Peeper', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'however', 'trailers', 'do', 'show', 'age', 'not', 'always', 'gracefully.Also', 'included', 'quite', 'in-depth', 'collectible', 'booklet.Recommended']",The Chairman
1016347,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000HT3PA6,D. S. Thurlow,"[4, 4]","In 1969, Red China was a dark and mysterious place, closed to the outside world, in the grip of the cultural revolution, and run by the charismatic Mao, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. When American scientist and Nobel Prize winner John Hathaway receives a letter from a former mentor now living in China, he is asked by his government to make a visit.  His old teacher may have invented an enzyme that allows crops to be grown anywhere.Gregory Peck is gruffly realistic as Hathaway, scientist and aging former intelligence asset.  His handler is a General Shelby, played with bureaucratic starchiness by Arthur Hill.  Shelby, at the head of a combined US, British, and Soviet operation, dispatches Hathaway into China with a micro-transmitter emplanted in his head.Upon arrival in China, Hathaway is graced by an audience with the Chairman himself, an intriguing political set-piece.  Hathaway finds his mentor in a remote rural compound near the Russian border, where the old man is under siege by the fanatical Red Guard.  When Hathaway suspects Chinese security is closing in, he will make a try for the enzyme formula and a break for the border.  The thrilling escape sequence is made all the more suspenseful for the audience by the knowledge, not shared by Hathaway, that Shelby will not let his agent be taken alive.The Cold War theatrical effects of ""The Chairman"" look slightly overdone at this distance of time, as does the effort to portray Hathaway as both spy and humanitarian.  However, the location shooting in China is grittily authentic and recreates the claustrophobic atmosphere of a revolution out of control.  The Chairman's meeting with Hathaway is stagey but contains a key philosphical point.  Hathaway's escape attempt holds up extremely well as a thrilling action sequence.  ""The Chairman"" is therefore highly recommended as a dated but still worthwhile Cold War thriller.",4,Atmospheric Cold War Thriller...,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,1908,"['1969', 'Red', 'China', 'was', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'place', 'closed', 'outside', 'world', 'grip', 'cultural', 'revolution', 'run', 'charismatic', 'Mao', 'Chairman', 'Chinese', 'Communist', 'Party', 'When', 'American', 'scientist', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'winner', 'John', 'Hathaway', 'letter', 'former', 'mentor', 'now', 'living', 'China', 'asked', 'government', 'make', 'visit', 'old', 'teacher', 'may', 'have', 'invented', 'enzyme', 'crops', 'be', 'grown', 'anywhere.Gregory', 'Peck', 'gruffly', 'realistic', 'Hathaway', 'scientist', 'aging', 'former', 'intelligence', 'asset', 'handler', 'General', 'Shelby', 'played', 'bureaucratic', 'starchiness', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'Shelby', 'head', 'combined', 'US', 'British', 'Soviet', 'operation', 'Hathaway', 'China', 'micro-transmitter', 'emplanted', 'head.Upon', 'arrival', 'China', 'Hathaway', 'graced', 'audience', 'Chairman', 'intriguing', 'political', 'set-piece', 'Hathaway', 'mentor', 'remote', 'rural', 'compound', 'Russian', 'border', 'where', 'old', 'man', 'siege', 'fanatical', 'Red', 'Guard', 'When', 'Hathaway', 'Chinese', 'security', 'closing', 'will', 'make', 'try', 'enzyme', 'formula', 'break', 'border', 'thrilling', 'escape', 'sequence', 'made', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'audience', 'knowledge', 'not', 'shared', 'Hathaway', 'Shelby', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'agent', 'be', 'taken', 'alive.The', 'Cold', 'War', 'theatrical', 'effects', 'Chairman', 'look', 'slightly', 'overdone', 'distance', 'time', 'effort', 'portray', 'Hathaway', 'spy', 'humanitarian', 'However', 'location', 'shooting', 'China', 'grittily', 'authentic', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'revolution', 'control', 'Chairman', 'meeting', 'Hathaway', 'stagey', 'key', 'philosphical', 'point', 'Hathaway', 'escape', 'attempt', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'thrilling', 'action', 'sequence', 'Chairman', 'therefore', 'highly', 'recommended', 'dated', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'Cold', 'War', 'thriller']",The Chairman

In any event, this is still worth watching and the picture looks great on the DVD.The commentary track is the same guys as several of these 60s era thrillers and they do a good job.

This film has great potential as a somewhat conventional spy film with a few experimental eavesdropping gadgets thrown in for good measure. Yet director J. Lee Thompson puts his own distinctive stamp on it making it a frenzied and often unsettling kaleidoscopic affair. It is taut, suspenseful and often defies credibility and that is what makes it so much fun and very entertaining. Gregory Peck and Arthur Hill are as stoic as ever and it is good to see actress Anne Heywood show up in this film. One of the highlights of this film is Jerry Goldsmith's incredible score. It is amazing how he intuitively puts such great effort at times into modest production's that aspire or beg for some added dimension to enhance the film.

Any hope of a serious political thriller is quickly lost as soon as Arthur Hill's cycloptic general turns up and it turns out the bug implanted in Gregory Peck's skull is also a bomb. What you get instead is a fairly glossy, fashionably cynical shot-on-location thriller that briefly touches on humanistic issues in a couple of scenes before getting back to the spy stuff that's neither James Bond nor John Le Carre but pure Hollywood hokum in the 60s mould. Ironically, although the producers harboured the notion of filming in China in a monumental fit of delusion, it was the Hong Kong and Taiwanese authorities that really objected to the subject matter (as either too defamatory or deferential to Mao as the prevailing mood would have it). J. Lee Thompson's direction is occasionally visually ambitious, but seems to have suffered in the editing, with several very obvious edits to alternate takes interrupting what were clearly intended as continuous camera moves. It's a shame that Fox's DVD is the US version, relegating the racier scenes to the extra features - who'd have thought there'd ever be a movie with Gregory Peck having his trousers undone by a naked woman on her knees?Fox have done an excellent job on this DVD - aside from a good 2.35:1 transfer and trailer, it also includes two alternate scenes and a 17-minute promotional cutdown of the feature (clearly put together before the climax was shot and featuring Burt Kwouk's own voice - in the feature he's dubbed by Robert Rietty) that includes some deleted footage.
