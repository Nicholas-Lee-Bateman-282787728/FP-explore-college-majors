It's not that. Cable wouldn't want this piece of un-marketable tripe when they're filled with top ""entertainment""?! Not ready for Sly-Fi Channel and it feels so good. Reality based, the story may pass to the supernatural as well as suspense , gore, mystery and it's a Christmas period chiller.Most panned this film and I see what they hate; but I also see what was meant to entertain. The story is lumpy but filled with more genres than a multiplex. Digital effects as well as blood-lite gore may be bone to pick; but it was all smooth for me. The style, soundtrack, story, setting, the campy allusions and story work the modest budget. Danny, Steve and Leelee are hotBottom line: I will watch this many times for mood and fun.BD is 1080p, the box says i.

Brian King surprises in his directorial debut, producing one shockingly unexpected twist after another as the three characters are destroyed by greed and paranoia. Tension runs high as more suspicious passengers and policemen hop on board along the way, but no one can anticipate how this one will end! Danny Glover outshines the rest of the cast as the unresolved train conductor, torn between his heartfelt sense of morality and the chance to save his dying wife. Steve Zahn may be passable in his role, but Leelee Sobieski severely detracts from the realness of the situation with her dry, staged performance.

1251857,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B0026MP19A,dv_forever,"[0, 0]","Read some of the reviews on this page and you'll know what to expect. This is a derivative, formulaic film that was released straight to DVD. I will instead focus on the positive merits of this train picture. First thing it has going for is the setting. Movies set on trains are just inherently cool. A confined environment that is also moving along just as the plot thickens. Plus outside the train is a barren, snowy landscape, draped in the darkness of night with no identifiable location or destination. To my personal movie viewing habits, this just works and gets my juices flowing.The characters are interesting. Essentially all loners, travelers, bumping into each other on this night journey because of a mysterious occurrence. A stranger boards the train at a stop and quickly is found dead of an apparent suicide. A strange object is found to be in his possession, over which the loners on the train will fight over until they begin to lose their lives one by one. Danny Glover puts in a compassionate performance as the conductor and I would say that every character is somewhat likable in their own bizarre way as their seemingly meaningless lives intersect this one night. It is difficult for me to relate to or like the company of most movie characters, especially in smaller B movies like this, but I liked most of them, even Leelee Sobieski's total weirdo and Steve Zahn's failed salesman. I can't say the same for the much of the supporting cast as they all seemed contrived.The main three characters are all weak moral cowards and quickly fall prey to greed and their own worst impulses. The actors make these people sympathetic and one empathizes with their sense of desperation. All alone on some train ride to nowhere desperately grasping at a chance for salvation from their life's situation. The salvation comes in the form of a magic box of sorts that actually puts everyone that comes in contact with onto the path of destruction. I found this movie to be an enjoyable diversion helped by it's atmosphere and sense of menace. If one has low expectations with pictures of this type, the viewer can reap some rewards.",3,"It's past midnight and you need an unambitious, atmospheric movie to watch.

1251858,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B0026MP19A,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","NIGHT TRAINAbsolutely one of the best independent films I have seen in a long time and very much real feeling. I remember buying this just based on the people who starred in it, even thought based on the name and cover it seemed like a ""Midnight Meat Train"" rip off. Luckily for me it was anything but and turned out to be on of the best movies I have watched in a while. Also it had nothing to do with any kind of story like that of the previously mentioned film.The film follows a group of people, three to be exact, on a train for one night each minding their own business. But on this one night they were destined to meet on be on this train. Miles [Danny Glover] is the senior train conductor for his station and is growing tired of his life on the train. Chloe [Leelee Sobieski] is just a passenger on her way to see her parents and Pete [Steve Zahn] is just another passenger on the train and is just as harmless as the other two. That is until the three stumble across a dead man on the train that has a little box with him. As they each look into the box they each decide that the treasure inside could make each one of them rich, and fix all their problems.So as they each come to terms with the situation they decide if they stick together and hide the box from the other passengers all will be fine. At the end of the night the will split what is in the box and all will be fine, but what about the body. As people come and go from the train with police and strangers who might know about the box the three become more and more distrusting. With greed running through their veins one thing must be asked, can they even trust each other?Now sure I may have gotten over clich&eacute; there at the end but hey it was a fun indie flick, what can I say. I remember seeing this movie at the store a couple of different times and passing it up but always remembering it later on. So finally when I went back to that store one day I decided to go ahead and grab it, what a great decision that was. Later on that night I called up my brother and then my grandparents and asked if they all wanted to see it. So since we all like these kinds of films we meet over at our grandparent's house and turned it on. Turned out to be one really good indie flick full of mystery and even a little twists and surprises. Writer/director Brian King did a great job with this low budget flick and really brought out some great stuff. I would love to explain some of the stuff that happens here from this film but I don't want to give anything away.I have to say that I hope I am not hyping this up to much it is just that I really did enjoy this movie. All the actors were great here with Danny Glover being awesome as usual and Steve Zahn bringing forth a great performance. Still I have to say that Leelee Sobieski really surprised me here turning in an MVP worthy performance. I won't give anything away but she did a great job here as did every one else. And although you can see the budget restraints when we see the out side of the train I have to say I love the look of the inside. Plus add in some great atmosphere and you have one great flick. I will say that this movie reminds me of the ""Twilight Zone"", very fun. I do recommend this movie and go in just expecting it to be a cool little indie flick.",5,GREAT INDIE TWILIGHT ZONE LIKE FILM,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,3299,"['NIGHT', 'TRAINAbsolutely', 'one', 'best', 'independent', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'very', 'much', 'real', 'feeling', 'remember', 'buying', 'just', 'based', 'people', 'who', 'starred', 'even', 'thought', 'based', 'name', 'cover', 'seemed', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'rip', 'Luckily', 'was', 'anything', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'while', 'Also', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'kind', 'story', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'film.The', 'film', 'group', 'people', 'three', 'be', 'exact', 'train', 'one', 'night', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'one', 'night', 'were', 'destined', 'meet', 'be', 'train', 'Miles', '[', 'Danny', 'Glover', ']', 'senior', 'train', 'conductor', 'station', 'growing', 'tired', 'life', 'train', 'Chloe', '[', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', ']', 'just', 'passenger', 'way', 'see', 'parents', 'Pete', '[', 'Steve', 'Zahn', ']', 'just', 'passenger', 'train', 'just', 'as', 'harmless', 'other', 'two', 'three', 'stumble', 'dead', 'man', 'train', 'little', 'box', 'look', 'box', 'decide', 'treasure', 'inside', 'could', 'make', 'one', 'rich', 'fix', 'problems.So', 'come', 'terms', 'situation', 'decide', 'stick', 'together', 'hide', 'box', 'other', 'passengers', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'end', 'night', 'will', 'split', 'what', 'box', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'what', 'body', 'people', 'come', 'go', 'train', 'police', 'strangers', 'who', 'might', 'know', 'box', 'three', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'distrusting', 'greed', 'running', 'veins', 'one', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'asked', 'can', 'even', 'trust', 'other', 'Now', 'sure', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'over', 'clich', 'eacute', 'end', 'hey', 'was', 'fun', 'indie', 'flick', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'store', 'couple', 'different', 'times', 'passing', 'up', 'always', 'remembering', 'later', 'So', 'finally', 'when', 'went', 'back', 'store', 'one', 'day', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'grab', 'what', 'great', 'decision', 'was', 'Later', 'night', 'called', 'up', 'brother', 'then', 'grandparents', 'asked', 'wanted', 'see', 'So', 'kinds', 'films', 'meet', 'grandparent', 'house', 'turned', 'Turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'indie', 'flick', 'full', 'mystery', 'even', 'little', 'twists', 'surprises', 'Writer/director', 'Brian', 'King', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'really', 'brought', 'out', 'great', 'stuff', 'would', 'love', 'explain', 'stuff', 'here', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away.I', 'have', 'say', 'hope', 'am', 'not', 'hyping', 'up', 'much', 'just', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'actors', 'were', 'great', 'here', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'being', 'awesome', 'usual', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'bringing', 'forth', 'great', 'performance', 'Still', 'have', 'say', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'really', 'surprised', 'here', 'turning', 'MVP', 'worthy', 'performance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'as', 'did', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'budget', 'restraints', 'when', 'see', 'out', 'side', 'train', 'have', 'say', 'love', 'look', 'inside', 'add', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'have', 'one', 'great', 'flick', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'very', 'fun', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'go', 'just', 'expecting', 'be', 'cool', 'little', 'indie', 'flick']",N/A

1251860,A1O820Q2OBFFQH,B0026MP19A,Hamish Adam,"[0, 0]","The film as a whole is really exciting and engaging.  This is odd in a way, because so many of its individual parts are flawed.  The acting is flat, the script derivative, the CGI amateurish, the soft focus cinematography distracting and the production design over-the-top. Together, however, they work really well.  As if a whole bunch of negatives cancel each other out into one big positive.Whatever.  The train exteriors are all CGI.  These could have been a bit more realistic - it is painfully obvious that it is CGI.  That said, once you suspend your disbelief, the analogy between a high speed journey through an anonymous void to a date with a disastrous destiny, is well made by that speeding train.The acting here and there is a tad wooden, as if the shoot was not only out of sequence but also interrupted and maybe even with a script that was being written as they went.  They are playing it flat and neutral because not only do they not know what's ahead of the scene they're working on, but they may also not know what preceded any given scene.  I don't actually know that's what happened, but with great actors like these, it's hard to understand otherwise why they are so flat.The CGI also kind of suggests that they started without a finished script.

The movie could have been made at anytime in history though; as the story of people driven mad by greed and disposing of each other is a old one.  The location this time is a train and the thriller aspect uses the claustrophobic nature of a train to good effect.  At first the movie plays like a typical greed thriller when a passenger dies and everyone wants what he has.  the viewer is left to wonder if it's 'diamonds"", ""gold"", or something else?;  So for a long while this movie doesn't let on it's science fiction aspects and that only adds a twist to the whole procedings.  The train the chaarcters are on is obviously a computer generated imageor cgi train except for the interior shots,  but it looks good enough; and on blu ray the whole movie of course looks as good as it can.  The cast are all seasoned veterans like Danny Glover, Leelee Sobieski, and Steve Zhan are engaging enough to carry the movie to it's conclusion.  This movie is a b movie with a higher budget than most of them and while it's not a great flick it's a good one and it's message about greed is timeless even with a sci-fi element added into it. Of course the  best greed movie ever is probably 'The Treasure of the Sierra madre' with Humphrey Bogart , and that one should be seen by everyone.

As the credits rolled, I noticed another familiar name, far down the list - Richard O'Brien. Since he was the creator and star of one of my favorite films of all time, I thought it would be kind of intriguing to see what he looked like after all these years. Since his glory days as Riff-Raff in his classic ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", he has made cameos in a bunch of movies, including ""Elvira's Haunted Hills"", but not much recently. As the film rolled on, I got so caught up in the plot that I realized I had not seen anyone that could possibly be him, except... NAH! Couldn't be! But as the movie neared the end, I figured I just HAD to be right. I agree fully with the comparisons to classic episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"", and I didn't mind the cheesy sets. It added to the atmosphere of the film. I could envision seeing this on SYFY on Saturday night (they just need to bleep out a couple of F-words), and it is a cut above their usual fare. And, yes, I was right about Mr. O'Brien. If you still don't recognize him, check out the ""making of"" featurette, where he appears as himself. Overall, this movie was much more entertaining than I expected given that it went direct to video.

1251866,A250AXLRBVYKB4,B0026MP19A,"Nathan Beauchamp ""ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...","[6, 12]","This is an unimpressive movie. Not because it was low budget (it was) nor because of the tenuous quality of the CGI (the exterior shots of the train resemble the surreal animation ofThe Polar Expressand look more like an HO model train than the real thing) and not even because of the relative quality of the story. The problem with this film is execution. A cautionary tale of the consequences of degrading ones morals for potential reward, it could be compared to The Monkeys Paw by W.W. Jacobs, or the Sci Fi mini seriesThe Lost Room, but unfortunately NIGHT TRAIN doesn't deliver much of a payoff for the viewer. Combine that with some downright silly plot elements, sprinkle in some bad acting, and you're left with a forgettable movie best saved for late night television. It's not impossible to enjoy, but you should go in expecting it to watch like a two hour long episode of the Outer Limits.The action of the film takes place around a mysterious box in the possession of man who boards the train and then dies of a combination of sleeping pills and vodka. The box contains something very valuable, and the three main characters spend the rest of the film ascertaining what to do with its contents.The attempts to flesh out the characters are clumsy at best. Especially bad is the hackneyed relationship between the main conductor and protagonist (Danny Glover) with his younger assistant. This relationship is so poorly constructed that it's painful to watch.The setting of the movie is an issue for me. The poorly rendered CGI train is hurdling through a landscape that looks like the surface of the moon but with snow. No cities, no lights, nothing. I guess it could be Alaska, but location is never explained. This becomes a problem when the total isolation of the train which is presented early in the film as a given is completely undone later on. First, we learn one of the protagonist is returning from a work Christmas party. Then we learn that the train is making several stops. Then there is a random (and all too convenient) road running alongside the tracks which allows the introduction of a police detective (again all too convenient). It seems like the movie can't decide if this train is running through a remote wilderness devoid of the assistance of society or if it is not in fact, isolated. It wants to play both sides of the field.The most laughable moment is when one character seals another into a sleeping berth using electrical tape around the edges to allegedly suffocate them. The man sealed inside IMMEDIATELY starts complaining that he can't breath. I mean come on, even assuming the audience can buy that sleeping berths are capable of being hermetically sealed in the first place, the air would not run out in a space that large for something close to an hour. Couple that with the character's total lack of imagination or energy to try and escape (no kicking the door, no using a belt of keys or anything else to try make a hole, etc...) and what your left with is another super convenient plot device. Lazy writing indeed.NIGHT TRAIN really falls to pieces in the final act when it tries to reveal too many things too quickly and ends up muddling all of them together and making none of them significant. Too little groundwork is laid to support much of what takes place at the end of the film, and much of it feels tacked on, or even worse, unimportant.The final scene is confusing and poorly done. The box is finally opened, but all we see is a golden glow similar to Jule's suitcase inPulp Fictionand the primary question surrounding its true nature is never answered. This is again, just lazy writing and poor execution.Ultimately, this is a movie that isn't worth owning. It might be worth renting if you enjoy Outer Limits/Twilight Zone types of movies. Just don't expect too much from it and you just might not be disappointed.2/5 Stars.",2,Train to Nowhere,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,3887,"['unimpressive', 'movie', 'Not', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'was', 'tenuous', 'quality', 'CGI', 'exterior', 'shots', 'train', 'resemble', 'surreal', 'animation', 'Polar', 'Expressand', 'look', 'more', 'HO', 'model', 'train', 'real', 'thing', 'not', 'even', 'relative', 'quality', 'story', 'problem', 'film', 'execution', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'consequences', 'degrading', 'ones', 'morals', 'potential', 'reward', 'could', 'be', 'compared', 'Monkeys', 'Paw', 'W.W.', 'Jacobs', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'mini', 'seriesThe', 'Lost', 'Room', 'unfortunately', 'NIGHT', 'TRAIN', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'much', 'payoff', 'viewer', 'Combine', 'downright', 'silly', 'plot', 'elements', 'sprinkle', 'bad', 'acting', ""'re"", 'left', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'best', 'saved', 'late', 'night', 'television', 'not', 'impossible', 'enjoy', 'should', 'go', 'expecting', 'watch', 'two', 'hour', 'long', 'episode', 'Outer', 'Limits.The', 'action', 'film', 'place', 'mysterious', 'box', 'possession', 'man', 'who', 'train', 'then', 'dies', 'combination', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'vodka', 'box', 'something', 'very', 'valuable', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'spend', 'rest', 'film', 'ascertaining', 'what', 'do', 'contents.The', 'attempts', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'are', 'clumsy', 'best', 'Especially', 'bad', 'hackneyed', 'relationship', 'main', 'conductor', 'protagonist', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'younger', 'assistant', 'relationship', 'so', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'painful', 'watch.The', 'setting', 'movie', 'issue', 'poorly', 'rendered', 'CGI', 'train', 'hurdling', 'landscape', 'surface', 'moon', 'snow', 'cities', 'lights', 'nothing', 'guess', 'could', 'be', 'Alaska', 'location', 'never', 'explained', 'problem', 'when', 'total', 'isolation', 'train', 'presented', 'early', 'film', 'given', 'completely', 'undone', 'later', 'First', 'learn', 'one', 'protagonist', 'returning', 'work', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Then', 'learn', 'train', 'making', 'several', 'stops', 'Then', 'random', 'too', 'convenient', 'road', 'running', 'alongside', 'tracks', 'introduction', 'police', 'detective', 'again', 'too', 'convenient', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'train', 'running', 'remote', 'wilderness', 'devoid', 'assistance', 'society', 'not', 'fact', 'isolated', 'play', 'sides', 'field.The', 'most', 'laughable', 'moment', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'sleeping', 'berth', 'using', 'electrical', 'tape', 'edges', 'allegedly', 'suffocate', 'man', 'sealed', 'inside', 'IMMEDIATELY', 'complaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'breath', 'mean', 'come', 'even', 'assuming', 'audience', 'can', 'buy', 'sleeping', 'berths', 'are', 'capable', 'being', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'first', 'place', 'air', 'would', 'not', 'run', 'out', 'space', 'large', 'something', 'close', 'hour', 'Couple', 'character', 'total', 'lack', 'imagination', 'energy', 'try', 'escape', 'kicking', 'door', 'using', 'belt', 'keys', 'anything', 'else', 'try', 'make', 'hole', 'etc', 'what', 'left', 'super', 'convenient', 'plot', 'device', 'Lazy', 'writing', 'indeed.NIGHT', 'TRAIN', 'really', 'pieces', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'reveal', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'too', 'quickly', 'up', 'muddling', 'together', 'making', 'none', 'significant', 'Too', 'little', 'groundwork', 'laid', 'support', 'much', 'what', 'place', 'end', 'film', 'much', 'tacked', 'even', 'worse', 'unimportant.The', 'final', 'scene', 'confusing', 'poorly', 'done', 'box', 'finally', 'opened', 'see', 'golden', 'glow', 'similar', 'Jule', 'suitcase', 'inPulp', 'Fictionand', 'primary', 'question', 'surrounding', 'true', 'nature', 'never', 'answered', 'again', 'just', 'lazy', 'writing', 'poor', 'execution.Ultimately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'owning', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'renting', 'enjoy', 'Outer', 'Limits/Twilight', 'Zone', 'types', 'movies', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.2/5', 'Stars']",N/A

1251869,A2ZGHESQDCI77M,B0026MP19A,"Shiloh True ""Rabid Reader""","[17, 19]","This movie explores what happens, when a few people taking the, NIGHT TRAIN, discover that a passenger is dead.  Initially, it was handled rather matter-of-factly. He had apparently taken some pills with alcohol. It was likely an overdose. But just who was this man---and why was he guarding his possessions so closely, and with such paranoia, when he boarded the train?Sharing his car were only two other passengers: a young pre-med student (Leelee Sobieski) and a salesman (Steven Zahn).  The veteran train conductor (Danny Glover) visits the car, shortly after the salesman notes the passenger deceased. While going through the man's possessions they discover a mysterious box.  It can't be opened, but one can peer inside through some carvings in the box.  The salesman takes an innocent peek, that will change all of their lives.  He becomes almost hypnotically entranced.  Each, in turn, follows suit. They all fall under the spell, and each tries to make the possession their own. It becomes a cat and mouse game, of the highest degree. And, why won't that darn box open?This movie could easily have been on the Sci-Fi Channel, as a modern day version of, 'The Twilight Zone.'  The theme was so similar to some of those, where the protagonist's values and moral compass, were put to the test by supernatural forces. And, how quickly, one could find his ethics in a state of total decay.  The suggestion always seemed to be, that evil could be unleashed in almost, any man, in the right circumstances, and, with the right temptations. The NIGHT TRAIN is no exception, as it explores these human dynamics and the effects of primal greed.While I recommend this film for those that enjoy the type of stories told in the old, 'Twilight Zone' series, be warned that the acting is 'B' movie grade. Leelee Sobieski delivers the best performance, showing the most unexpected character change, followed by Steve Zahn.  Danny Glover was just, well, Danny Glover. He wasn't challenged enough by this role to stray from his customary style and affect. Secondary characters were minimally developed. They simply drove the story along, or presented obstacles.  You will also need to suspend some disbelief.  Like why were there so few passengers on this train---and why were they spread so far apart? In some instances, there was only one passenger per train car. It was an unlikely scenario to set the stage.I watched the Blu-ray version and found the audio/video experience to be quite good.  There is also almost an hour's worth of Bonus Features, following this 91 minute film.  It is rated 'R', for violent content and some language, so it's not for youngsters.I can't recommend that you run out and purchase this one, without renting it, first. I picked it up as a rental after reading the synopsis. It hooked me!  I had to take the mystery to closure, to learn more about that crazy box, but I think one viewing is enough for me.  Did the box ever open?  I'm not tellin'.  I recommend you grab some popcorn, and hop on board the blood-train to find out.

A small mistake, made a little worse with how much I enjoyed King's last film in Cypher. All sarcasm aside, this was a train wreck beginning to end.The story follows three strangers on a train that decide to be greedy and take a dead man's loot for themselves. I like all three actors in Sobieski, Glover and Zahn - but this will be a paycheck for them and little else for being remembered.The Blu quality and DTS were both average, but the CGI was horrendous and not meant to be in 1080i (one of the few BDs I have seen where it states the ""i"" for the feature instead of the usual). The special features were VERY dry, and include two documentary supplements that total 50 minutes. Most of the material contains interviews and long sessions of actors talking about nothing. The priceless moment is with Sobieski though. The ""Making-of"" had spliced footage from the much longer takes in the ""Interview Bits"", and there was this constant movement behind her chair but you couldn't tell what it was. Once you watch both sets, you realize it is this dog sniffing around for a place to pee, which right when it starts to go on the lamp next to her - they cut it out; a good sign as to how serious these interviews were being taken.A forgettable film with a lame ending with a below average Blu preservation.

1251873,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0026MP19A,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","US-German-Romanian production ""Night Train"" opens like a dark, noir-like thriller set in a night train running through the snow on Christmas Eve, on which two passengers Chloe (Leelee Sobieski) and Peter (Steve Zahn), and a veteran conductor Miles (Danny Glover) stumble upon a mysterious box. The box, which seems to contain something valuable, actually belongs to a stranger who has just passed away on the train. So what would they do? Call the next station and report it? Or keep the box for themselves, or perhaps him/herself?The fast-pace thriller starts promisingly with three main characters who slowly reveal their true personalities to each other. Part of the film's premise might remind us of ""Shallow Grave"" or ""A Simple Plan,"" but some may remember the classic ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."" Desire and suspicion play an important role in furthering the story, but there is also a ""Twilight Zone""-like supernatural element about the storyline, especially in the second half of it.That is where the story gets derailed. Writer/director Brian King (writer for Vincenzo Natali's unique thriller ""Cypher"") is eager to entertain the viewers with actions and surprises, but as the story unfolds, things start to look too incredible, even silly, to take seriously. Also, external shots of the train are shot with special effects and they are not very impressive, making the film's climax less suspenseful than it should be.To be fair, ""Night Train"" (Leelee Sobieski and her performance in particular) is not boring.
