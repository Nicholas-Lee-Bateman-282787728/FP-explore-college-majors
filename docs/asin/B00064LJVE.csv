""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" are two of the best thrillers of the last five years *arguably only outranked by ""The Ring""* and I expected this to be just as good if not better. Sadly I was wrong.The trailer is very misleading, however genius. By viewing the trailer alone, this movie looked fantastically creepy and horrifying....this little 19th century village isolated and surrounded by woods where something lurks....Unfortunately, the movie takes a different twist and ruins it. Don't get me wrong...I never saw the twist coming and it was definitely interesting, I was just expecting a diffrent kind of movie....the one portrayed in the trailer would've been one heck of a thriller.",2,Disappointing.....,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,746,"['most', 'people', 'loved', 'director', 'previous', 'work', 'Signs', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'thrillers', 'last', 'five', 'years', '*arguably', 'only', 'outranked', 'Ring', '*', 'expected', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'Sadly', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'trailer', 'very', 'misleading', 'however', 'genius', 'viewing', 'trailer', 'alone', 'movie', 'looked', 'fantastically', 'creepy', 'horrifying', '.this', 'little', '19th', 'century', 'village', 'isolated', 'surrounded', 'woods', 'where', 'something', 'lurks', '.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'different', 'twist', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'never', 'saw', 'twist', 'coming', 'was', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'was', 'just', 'expecting', 'diffrent', 'kind', 'movie', 'one', 'portrayed', 'trailer', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'heck', 'thriller']",N/A

The story line was really weak, and really a stretch.  Most people of average intelligence can figure out where this movie is going about 30 minutes into the film.  But, visually, and I love those Fall and Winter visuals, this film is beautiful.  And, the actors, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and Bryce Howard do a splendid job with a bad plot.  The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is 5 stars and is really what saves this film.  The Village should be in everyone's private film library because it is the best example of M. Night Shymalan's use of camera as canvas, despite it being his worse film story.

859771,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B00064LJVE,A Customer,"[4, 5]","I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane.Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that.My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress.THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters.That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start.(The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.)""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it.Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this?""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium.""That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all.",3,Shyamalan,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,2478,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'talk', 'lot', 'movie', 'could', 'spoil', 'effect', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'filmmaker', 'first', 'movie', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'also', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'first', 'saw', 'December', '1999', '20-hour', 'flight', 'Chicago', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'only', 'flight', 'USA', 'film', 'really', 'pulled', 'suspect', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'airplane.Then', 'ending', 'Based', 'article', 'just', 'read', 'can', 'say', 'viewers', 'were', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'Me', 'was', 'blown', 'heck', 'away', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'Years', 'later', 'finally', 'did', 'taught', 'movie', 'classes', 'film', 'chose', 'saw', 'dozen', 'times', 'fully', 'aware', 'ending', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'going', 'only', 'complaint', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'was', 'star', 'star', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'surprise', 'ending', 'was', 'watching', 'kid', 'instead', 'shrink', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'could', 'probably', 'star', 'few', 'more', 'movies', 'died', ""'d"", 'never', 'notice', 'digress.THE', 'VILLAGE', 'pilgrim-style', 'village', 'place', 'quaint', 'rural', 'close', 'knit', 'low', 'tech', 'Nobody', 'village', 'surrounding', 'woods', 'lest', 'encounter', 'Do', 'Not', 'Speak', 'acting', 'was', 'flawless', 'scenery', 'most', 'certainly', 'created', 'mood', 'Shyamalan', 'masterful', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'had', 'trouble', 'caring', 'what', 'happened', 'characters.That', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fault', 'Saturday', 'morning', '8', 'Jan', 'was', 'working', 'goal', 'day', 'was', 'pack', 'impending', 'move', 'was', 'too', 'drained', 'begin', 'neighbor', 'had', 'loaned', 'DVD', 'back', 'February', 'figured', 'watching', 'returning', 'was', 'good', 'start', 'same', 'bad', 'attitude', 'brought', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'right', 'One', 'days', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'ending', 'How', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'filmmaker', 'judged', 'solely', 'ending', 'case', 'THE', 'VILLAGE', 'worked', 'thought', 'film', 'days', 'seeing', 'it.Actually', 'was', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'write', 'review', 'How', 'Shyamalan', 'filmmaker', 'bold', 'originality', 'surviving', 'commercialized', 'medium', 'good', 'thing', 'matter', 'what', 'opinion', 'individual', 'film', 'believe', 'critics', 'are', 'panning', ""'m"", 'not', 'panning', 'one', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'few', 'films', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'THE', 'VILLAGE', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'VILLAGE', ""'ll"", 'watch']",N/A
859772,A2P55B94DW9IZB,B00064LJVE,Adam D. Dunn,"[1, 2]","I think the problem is the director bills this as another scare movie with a twist like Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.

859773,A33L7G4E8CID3,B00064LJVE,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[4, 6]","I don't know what happened here, but every frame of this movie screams vanity project. Shyamalan can create great popcorn movies, but this over-solemn, over-symbolic, and seemingly over-long (although it only lasts two hours) piece is a groaner all the way.The story revolves around an unknown village, time undetermined. The villagers go through their daily motions, and it mostly seems like a particularly boring village, except for a few evil monsters living in the woods, who occasionally show up to scare the villagers, then leave. There's a boundary that the villagers can't cross, otherwise they'll be at the mercy of these horrid things. The main characters of this quasi-epic are Joaquin Phoenix as an energetic young man with small-town restlessness, Bryce Dallas Howard as his enamorata, the blind Ivy, and William Hurt as the village's ever-concerned uber-meister. A medical emergency develops in the village, which necessitates that someone leave the village for help, and it is Ivy who must go through the woods to find help.Those who might be expecting a scare-fest might be disappointed. The promised scares here never materialize: what we get instead are things jumping at the screen, a technique which requires no real artistry or craft. In fact, almost all of Shyamalan's movies have used similar tactics, and a scare that has to use a knee-jerk reaction doesn't really count. It's like cursing in front of an audience of sixth-graders: they'll laugh, but not because you're witty--more because it's out of context and they're uncomfortable and trying to lessen the tension.The story, though, is even worse: the twist is something you'll think about 10 minutes into the movie, then discard by saying, ""That's too stupid."" Then you'll find it to be true. It is my pick for the stupidest movie twist of all time, in my opinion it is far worse than the ""it was all a dream"" ending. I would call it a deus ex machina, but it's not: a deus ex machina is an ending that comes about because a writer wrote himself (or herself) into a corner and can't end the story. This movie was structured around its ""twist"" from the beginning, which is akin to attempting to build a skyscraper on a local swamp. The characters, with one exception, are as flat as a pancake. The exception is the newcomer, Bryce Howard, who almost saves the movie. Almost, but not quite. The absolute worst part, though, is the all-too-obvious symbolism about American isolationism. I'm not saying that the director is wrong, necessarily, it's just that it's put forth with no subtlety, in a way that makes you cringe because of the oversimplicity of it all. I equate it to House of Sand and Fog and John Q., the latter of which it resembles way too much in its mix of too-serious--even pompous--melodrama, overt manipulation, and predictable storyline. Although this movie isn't worse than John Q. (I happen to believe that movie to be the worst movie made in the last decade at least), a comparison to it is not a plus.The redeeming values in the movie, though, are Ms. Howard's astonishing breakthrough performance, which almost redeems the non-scares, non-power, and non-drama; and one scene that takes place on a porch, which has Phoenix and Howard talking about life, love, and much else, which makes the movie's curious dialog almost beautiful, and almost turns the movie into something else altogether. My advice to the Shyamster: leave the protesting to other people and give us some more enjoyable pulp, but don't go pretentious. Look at what happened to Woody Allen. Stick to what you do, and you'll be fine, but don't try more unless you know what you're doing.",2,Some redeeming value,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,3654,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'frame', 'movie', 'vanity', 'project', 'Shyamalan', 'can', 'create', 'great', 'popcorn', 'movies', 'over-solemn', 'over-symbolic', 'seemingly', 'over-long', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'piece', 'groaner', 'way.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'unknown', 'village', 'time', 'undetermined', 'villagers', 'go', 'daily', 'motions', 'mostly', 'particularly', 'boring', 'village', 'few', 'evil', 'monsters', 'living', 'woods', 'who', 'occasionally', 'show', 'up', 'scare', 'villagers', 'then', 'leave', 'boundary', 'villagers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cross', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'mercy', 'horrid', 'things', 'main', 'characters', 'quasi-epic', 'are', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'energetic', 'young', 'man', 'small-town', 'restlessness', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'enamorata', 'blind', 'Ivy', 'William', 'Hurt', 'village', 'ever-concerned', 'uber-meister', 'A', 'medical', 'emergency', 'village', 'someone', 'leave', 'village', 'help', 'Ivy', 'who', 'must', 'go', 'woods', 'find', 'help.Those', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'expecting', 'scare-fest', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'promised', 'scares', 'here', 'never', 'materialize', 'what', 'get', 'instead', 'are', 'things', 'jumping', 'screen', 'technique', 'real', 'artistry', 'craft', 'fact', 'almost', 'Shyamalan', 'movies', 'have', 'used', 'similar', 'tactics', 'scare', 'use', 'knee-jerk', 'reaction', ""n't"", 'really', 'count', 'cursing', 'front', 'audience', 'sixth-graders', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'not', ""'re"", 'witty', 'more', 'context', ""'re"", 'uncomfortable', 'trying', 'lessen', 'tension.The', 'story', 'even', 'worse', 'twist', 'something', ""'ll"", 'think', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'then', 'discard', 'saying', 'too', 'stupid', 'Then', ""'ll"", 'find', 'be', 'true', 'pick', 'stupidest', 'movie', 'twist', 'time', 'opinion', 'far', 'worse', 'was', 'dream', 'ending', 'would', 'call', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'not', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'ending', 'about', 'writer', 'wrote', 'corner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'end', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'structured', 'twist', 'beginning', 'akin', 'attempting', 'build', 'skyscraper', 'local', 'swamp', 'characters', 'one', 'exception', 'are', 'as', 'flat', 'pancake', 'exception', 'newcomer', 'Bryce', 'Howard', 'who', 'almost', 'movie', 'Almost', 'not', 'quite', 'absolute', 'worst', 'part', 'all-too-obvious', 'symbolism', 'American', 'isolationism', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'director', 'wrong', 'necessarily', 'just', 'put', 'forth', 'subtlety', 'way', 'cringe', 'oversimplicity', 'equate', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'John', 'Q.', 'latter', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'mix', 'too-serious', 'even', 'pompous', 'melodrama', 'overt', 'manipulation', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worse', 'John', 'Q', 'happen', 'believe', 'movie', 'be', 'worst', 'movie', 'made', 'last', 'decade', 'least', 'comparison', 'not', 'plus.The', 'redeeming', 'values', 'movie', 'are', 'Ms.', 'Howard', 'astonishing', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'almost', 'non-scares', 'non-power', 'non-drama', 'one', 'scene', 'place', 'porch', 'Phoenix', 'Howard', 'talking', 'life', 'love', 'much', 'else', 'movie', 'curious', 'dialog', 'almost', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'movie', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', 'advice', 'Shyamster', 'leave', 'protesting', 'other', 'people', 'give', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'pulp', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'pretentious', 'Look', 'what', 'happened', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Stick', 'what', 'do', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'more', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing']",N/A

859779,A30O553ONO1IIP,B00064LJVE,Ahmed Khalifa,"[5, 7]","M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors working in Hollywood who truly has talent and respect for his craft as evidenced by his masterful films ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", films with ingenious scripts and sublime yet subdued direction. Alas, ""The Village"" is not on par with these films, not by far. Shyamalan was already begining to falter with his previous film ""Signs"" which miscast Mel Gibson in a serious role way above his dramatic abilities and which had a tone that wavered between pretentious and hammy (and let's not even mention the twist ending of that movie). ""The Village"" is even worse than ""Signs"" as it is a film that is overly pretentious, bland, po-faced and above all, handled with a hand so heavy that the film is crushed under its weight. The story about a secluded community in Pennsylvania in the 19th century which begins to experience terrifying trespasses from mysterious creatures who live in the surrounding woods, is simple and at first, intriguing. But the stilted dialogue, portentous tone and crawling pace, deaden every inch of luster out of the premise, and to make matters worse, the plot takes a harrowingly stupid turn at the end that renders the whole film pointless and ridiculously self-important. With bland performances from an all star cast, Shyamalan's pretentious handling and a twist at the end that is so ludicrous it is almost insulting, the film is a mess from beginning to end, which is something that is very painful to experience especially knowing what Shyamalan is capable of in terms of pure cinematic genius.

859780,A379SAP75SPDHD,B00064LJVE,Alec Solomita,"[6, 8]","M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, and what happens in this film is another reason why. Night never does what you think he will do, and doesn't cater to the audience in the way most directors do. The Village centers around a group of people who live in a almost amish type setting, away from the rest of the world in what seems to be 1800's. The village members all live together harmoniously, as long as they don't enter the woods, where supposed creatures they can not speak of live, and with whom they have a pact that they must not violate or bloodshed will ensue. They can never have the color red around, as it attracts the monsters. That is the main setup, and the stroy goes from there as Joaquin Phoenix, who gives another great performance in a Shyamalan film, the other being Signs, is a village youth who wants to go to the towns, past the woods, to get medicine, as a child has just died in the town because they could not save him. William Hurt, a great actor in a great role and performance, is the leader of the town and the father of Ivy, played brillinatly in her first role by Bryce Dallas Howard. Ivy is a blind girl who seems to have all the good qualities of the town and everyone loves her, especially Lucius, played by Phoenix and a mentally unstable character played amazing by Adrien Brody. Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson also put in very good performances in a film that is impossible to talk about unless I give spoilers. The movie is about fear and pain, and what we will do to avoid pain and how we react to fear. It is the most beautifully shot film of the year and is definitely the most engrossing. The score is nothing short of amazing and should be recognized at Oscar time. The film will anger many people who don't like where it goes, but in my opinion, it goes exactly where it should go, and it should mkae us look at our own lives and our feelings on fear and pain. The movie, as thought provoking as it is, is still one of the best films of th year and one of the most entertaining. Ignore what other people might be saying about this film, and see it for yourself.

True too: Shyamalan has a good eye, and some of the shots were ravishing. True as well: Bryce Dallas Howard is lovely and does as much with her as one could hope in the midst of such drivel. We could even add that the premise has a good deal of potential, and in the hands of a writer/director who actually had something to say, it might have been the basis of a perfectly good movie. Instead, we got a plot filled with gaping holes, dialogue mostly so wooden and unbelievable that it must have pained the good actors in this traffic accident to deliver it, and -- worst of all -- an utter lack of any real suspense.My sense while I watched was that the cast and crew must have spent a good deal of time snickering behind Shyamalan's back.

All his characters, in all his movies, are stupefied individuals that do not talk much and have surprised expressions on their faces for most of the time. I really liked The sixth sense, then everything that came after that is just, in a way, some sort of boring repetition of the same story. I think I will keep watching Mr Shyamalan's movies, but next time I will know what to expect. A great trailer, a promising start, and then disappointment crawling in slowly but steadily, and a real let down at the end. The whole ""unbreakable"" was one of the very worst and more pretentious movies I ever saw, Signs was promising, and at time really creepy, but it ended being the usual stupid trivial Hollywood movie about characters going through adversity and finding solutions to their inner problems (with some sequences really embarassing), this movie starts looking like a well done horror, and then after the first hour I started doing something else while the DVD kept going on. The sequence with the blind girl in the woods starts well, but then it turns quickly into a totally unbelievable story. I think it shows that Mr Shyamalan has no idea whatsoever about what it means to be blind.This is a good director that should find a way to stop doing the same thing over and over again.

Not that I haven't enjoyed them at a certain level, just not to the point of being inspired to write about the experience.... Until I experienced The Village! What is it about the movie that has inspired me, you ask??? Well, you've probably read the reviews that basically said that M. Night Shyamalan has failed on his 4th big picture release. How it wasn't scary and failed on the twisty ending, unlike the successful ""The Sixth Sense"". Well, I am here to tell you that he was successful in what he set out to do with this movie. In the sense that he touched on multiple themes; the ""horror/suspense"" flavors that he likes to sprinkle on his movies was present, and just like his other movies, was NOT the main theme. The Village does touch on romance and also flirts with that unknown element that all his movies seem to have, whether it is; dead people, super powers, aliens or in this case, monsters; it had that suspenseful layer. It just wasn't as heavy or as prevalent as in his other movies, but it was injected just enough to add the unknown and make you feel a little uneasy at times. It also has the twist ending.  But, the main theme to this movie is Humanity, the human spirit and how flawed it is. It's flawed because it loves, hates, cares, is indifferent, beautiful, ugly, good and evil all bundled together. No matter how you try to hide it, or reinvent it, the true nature of humanity will always come out. That is what this movie is about. The human spirit and how it needs to soar high. That our dreams and desires cry out and inevitably consume us. The Village is about a journey to ""Shangri-La"" but ends up right were it started! You probably want a synopsis of some type but I know that you have read it in all the other reviews that are listed and I wanted to give you something more than a summary; I wanted to give you the reason to get this film.

It's shot beautifully, boasts a talented cast of actors, showcases a clearly talented new comer in Bryce Howard, but leaves the viewer with the dreaded, ""Is that it?  Is that all there is?""Scores of armchair film reviewers along with seasoned pros, have criticized, scorned and outright panned the film for it's obvious borrowing from Rod Serling's classic TV show &lt;M. Night, if you NEVER did see that TZ episode, I'd be shocked!> so there's no reason to go over well trod analytical territory.  What I'd like to comment on is the inherent weakness of the character motivations.  After all in a film such as this, everything hinges upon character mindsets and decisions.I should say bizarre and unbelievable character motivations.  Granted, there have been public - and private - cults of people who would make the denizens of The Village look tame - Rev Jim Jones Cult, Korseh in Waco Texas and the Halle Bopp Comet come to mind, however it strains credulity in most every way to believe that so many would give up so much to gain so little.But they had a pristine green valley, sturdily built cute houses and fashions that would make Laura ""Half-pint"" Ingalls Wilder green with envy!  Yes, they did.  They also had no sense of natural progress, no sense of bestowing free choice and entitlement onto their children and of course no sense of reality.  These people were on par with the Truman Show - living a life of illusion while only the elder anointed knew the truth, because it was for the ""better.""  The Village reminded me of just another lavish reality show, except in this case, nobody was voted off, nobody won a prize and nobody was laughing.On the contrary, because of their refusal to keep any type of modern medicinal supplies, tragedy almost happened.  Plot devices like this one are what's so frustrating - there was a thousand reasons why Ivy could have ventured ""beyond the border"" - this one is contrived, convenient and ultimately idiotic.  If only the director had added scenes of regret, or philosophical doubt on the parts of the participants - something.  Instead we get a rushed scene about how ""our life must continue in this fashion.""  If you plan a community that much, if you put that much work and financial resources into it , you don't ever consider medical emergencies?  Yes, it was an experiment in ""utopia"" - things like that SHOULDN'T have happened in such an environment of innocence.And therein lies the irony, for despite a thoroughly pleasing looking movie with great acting, The Village should not have happened either.",2,"""Little House On The Prairie"" Meets ""Twilight Zone"" meets  ""The Truman Show""",1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,2611,"['Village', 'completely', 'frustrating', 'film', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'talented', 'cast', 'actors', 'clearly', 'talented', 'new', 'comer', 'Bryce', 'Howard', 'viewer', 'dreaded', 'Scores', 'armchair', 'film', 'reviewers', 'seasoned', 'pros', 'have', 'criticized', 'scorned', 'outright', 'panned', 'film', 'obvious', 'borrowing', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'classic', 'TV', 'show', 'lt', 'M.', 'Night', 'NEVER', 'did', 'see', 'TZ', 'episode', ""'d"", 'be', 'shocked', '>', 'reason', 'go', 'over', 'well', 'trod', 'analytical', 'territory', 'What', ""'d"", 'like', 'comment', 'inherent', 'weakness', 'character', 'motivations', 'film', 'such', 'everything', 'hinges', 'character', 'mindsets', 'decisions.I', 'should', 'say', 'bizarre', 'unbelievable', 'character', 'motivations', 'Granted', 'have', 'been', 'public', 'private', 'cults', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'denizens', 'Village', 'look', 'tame', 'Rev', 'Jim', 'Jones', 'Cult', 'Korseh', 'Waco', 'Texas', 'Halle', 'Bopp', 'Comet', 'come', 'mind', 'however', 'credulity', 'most', 'way', 'believe', 'so', 'many', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'gain', 'so', 'little.But', 'had', 'pristine', 'green', 'valley', 'sturdily', 'built', 'cute', 'houses', 'fashions', 'would', 'make', 'Laura', 'Half-pint', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'green', 'envy', 'Yes', 'did', 'also', 'had', 'sense', 'natural', 'progress', 'sense', 'bestowing', 'free', 'choice', 'entitlement', 'children', 'course', 'sense', 'reality', 'people', 'were', 'par', 'Truman', 'Show', 'living', 'life', 'illusion', 'only', 'elder', 'anointed', 'knew', 'truth', 'was', 'better', 'Village', 'reminded', 'just', 'lavish', 'reality', 'show', 'case', 'nobody', 'was', 'voted', 'off', 'nobody', 'won', 'prize', 'nobody', 'was', 'laughing.On', 'contrary', 'refusal', 'keep', 'type', 'modern', 'medicinal', 'supplies', 'tragedy', 'almost', 'happened', 'Plot', 'devices', 'one', 'are', 'what', 'so', 'frustrating', 'was', 'thousand', 'reasons', 'why', 'Ivy', 'could', 'have', 'ventured', 'border', 'one', 'contrived', 'convenient', 'ultimately', 'idiotic', 'only', 'director', 'had', 'added', 'scenes', 'regret', 'philosophical', 'doubt', 'parts', 'participants', 'something', 'Instead', 'get', 'rushed', 'scene', 'how', 'life', 'must', 'continue', 'fashion', 'plan', 'community', 'much', 'put', 'much', 'work', 'financial', 'resources', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'consider', 'medical', 'emergencies', 'Yes', 'was', 'experiment', 'utopia', 'things', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'have', 'happened', 'such', 'environment', 'innocence.And', 'therein', 'irony', 'thoroughly', 'pleasing', 'looking', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'Village', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'happened']",N/A

859792,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00064LJVE,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[1, 3]","This is only the second M. Night Shyamalan movie that I've seen (the first being &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;), and sadly, it seems that &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is both a blessing and a curse for Shyamalan. After four films where a huge twist is revealed at the end, it seems that the films have become somewhat formulaic. I think that the best twist ending for his next movie would be that it should have no twist.Anyway, this movie takes place in a secluded, unnamed village in Pennsylvania. The villagers have lived here their entire lives, and no one has ever left or arrived. This is because of the dark creatures that reside in the woods surrounding the village. As long as the villagers don't go into the woods, the creatures won't bother them. However, after the deaths of some of the residents, Lucious Hunt (Joquain Phoenix) decides that he must venture to &quot;The Towns&quot; to retrieve some medicine to prevent further deaths. However, the elders of the village, who serve as the governing body, determine that it not worth risking everyone in the village to save a few. After this, events involving a love triangle between Hunt, Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), the blind daughter of one of the elders, and Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), a mentally challenged man, occur. Also the creatures begin to cross the borders into the village, striking fear into the townspeople. And then, in the big twist ending...Just kidding. On the subject of the ending however, I have to brag that I was able to figure it out about three quarters into the film. As surprising as the ending is, it doesn't have all the shock that &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; did. Oh well. This movie will entertain you.

859794,A47OISX4AV8I,B00064LJVE,AngelosOne,"[5, 8]","I really hate people sometimes.  They grab onto a single concept and never let go.  People saw the Sixth Sense, and the ""twist"" ending and they immediatly associated with M. Night, expecting him to do it movie after movie, after movie.Of course, along the way, those movie goers forgot to watch the film, but instead, kept trying to watch for the twist.  It's silly to me, that people keep expecting twists from his movies, as though that was the sole purpose of his directing.  They failed to see what his movies really are.The same thing happend with Unbreakable, which in my opinion, is probably the best super hero origin movie ever made, because it's so realistically done, you can't feel but believe that this man has special powers.  It wasn't your typical super hero driven movie like xmen, where the powers take over the film. But no, people had to judge it because the ending wasn't twisty enough for them.  Sigh, I still remember comments by people saying that the ending was a weak twist ending, as though M Nigh had ever said he was going for a twist ending.It's the same with this movie.  People kept hoping for the twist ending, and when they didn't get it, they completely lampooned this movie and called it bad.  I mean, can you really call it a twist ending, when you are pretty much told almost 30 minutes before the movie ends that these folks live in the present time? I saw that part of the story coming miles away (especially with the mention of the box they didn't want anyone to open- I either figure it had a gun or some kind of electronic).The movie itself is a what if situation. A study on how it is truly impossible to control all the bad things that happen in the world.  Evil actions will still be committed by people, now matter how much you try, because in the end, it is our own human nature that causes those actions.  We feel love, hate/anger, greed, sadness/depression.  Violent crimes are often committed because one of those emotions.The choice of colors for the movie also shows its point.  By making red the 'forbidden' color, the elders were trying to instill in the younger folks that killing or hurting someone else was bad.  Blood is red, so by hurting someone, you are bringing out the 'forbidden' color.  While yellow, if I remember correctly, psychologically, has a soothing effect on human psyche.  Yellow is attributed as a color that calms down people (I think I read of a study where they painted a room yellow and found that the person in the study was less inclined to get angry.)Of course, people get fixated on things.  They saw the ads, and they wanted to be scared. They wanted monsters and thrillers. What they got was a movie that required you to think, and of course, people hate it if they don't get what they wanted.It's a movie about wanting innocence.  How people react to innocence and the fact that today's society has lost it.  We are a society that believes themselves to be right in everything. Ask anyone about their political belief, and they will never once concede that they might not be right.The ending wasn't a twist ending, instead to me, it was rather endearing. For one thing, what I saw was that this park Ranger, an over-informed 21st century person, reacted to Ivy's innocence, her pleas and felt compelled to protect that innocence.  It's interesting to see that he was young himself, not yet too old so as to be absolutely cynical.  Why do we try to protect our children, or any child? Because we want to protect innocence.

Night Shyamalan's most recent film The Village. The evening my sister, brother and I went to the theatre to see it, we were completely mesmerized from the moment the music began until the very last credit disappeared from the screen.Many people do not presently appreciate the brilliance of the film, but I believe, in time, more and more will come to realize what a masterpiece it really is. The film was made for an intelligent, thinking audience, but it was inappropriately marketed for grim and gore seekers. The unfortunate result was that many of the thinkers avoided seeing it because they are not usually interested in gore, and the horror fiends hated it because there wasn't any.The film contains breathtaking music and cinematography, and excellent dialogue. The casting and acting is flawless. The characters develop very well throughout, and the storyline is surprisingly fresh and original.

The director is in the unenviable position of expectations to continue to better his previous films.  He has almost pigeon-holed himself as ""that director"" who likes to fool his audience.  Loved ""Sixth Sense"" and enjoyed ""Unbreakable"" and found ""Signs"" to be suspenseful, though disappointing in the end.  So I had some hesitation about this film.It turned out to be quite a thrill, especially not knowing anything about it and not having read any reviews about it.  I was skeptical yet hopeful for some goosebumps.  I was not disappointed.He continues certain themes.  His use of color is significant and his settings and overall mood are top-notch.  Hard to imagine a better cinematographer out there in terms of setting.  The premise is almost fairy tale like.  A village lives in fear of ""monsters"" beyond its borders in the woods, hearkening back to the childhood fears of most everybody.As with any community there are always those curious about what is on the outside.  One brave soul decides he wishes to venture out beyond the borders.  And so begins the adventure.  It may not sound like much but I found it to be plenty spine tingling to watch and suspenseful enough to keep me interested.  And yes, once again, the ending was unexpected.I would recommend not reading too much about the film.

Mesa,"[2, 2]","Film about an almost Amish-like community who have made a pact or truce with ominous and dangerous &quot;creatures&quot; beyond their village to never go into their territory and disturb them and that which they inhabit.Many of the villagers themselves, especially the young have never wandered past the community and into the woods or the &quot;outside&quot; world in their entire lives! They know no outside world.Sounds simple and easy enough to uphold the law of never breaking the barrier right?However, the barrier is finally breached by someone. In addition, pets and farm animals are mysteriously mutilated and a tragedy occurs forcing certain members to consider breaching the barrier again to seek outside help...The council elders also have &quot;secrets&quot; of their own they are hiding...Unfortunately, so many reviewers have given almost EVERYTHING away before others have had the chance to see it and form their own opinions...I'll admit I am guilty of reading a few of these before I went and saw it tonight despite the plot or story freebies given by others...However,the more I think about this film, the more I actually was intrigued and really liked it. Part suspense, a hint of horror, drama, and the ever popular &quot;thought -I -knew -what -it -was- about&quot; routine...Shyamalan pretty much does what he did for Unbreakable (though, to me Unbreakable was such a let down and painfully slow at times) in that the viewer is led to believe the film is about one thing through the excellent previews to entice audiences.This is done to the point where as a viewer you may even think you have the type of genre the movie is pegged.Wrong.In this respect this is his gift or talent as a story teller to keep you hooked along with superb marketing and advertising tactics.Afterwards, you decide if it was intriguing or not. You really don't know what the twist or ending is really going to be despite the true nature revealed in the middle of the film of what the evil is that lurks beyond the village's borders.I'll admit that The Village does have it's slow paced moments but not enough to lull anyone into a coma. I will say this, the ending will definitely surprise audiences more than shock! The ending is strongly reminiscent of an old black and white Twilight Zone episode...Maybe that's the only thing director Shyamalan can be accused of is probably being influenced or slightly borrowing the concept from but giving it his own spin or panache.The performances by various top name actors were excellent(particularly Ron Howoard's daughter as the portrayal of a blind girl) but none overshadowed or vied for the spotlight over the other. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. When the story ends one can definitely say it was not your average or normal typical ending for this type of film (what type of film? You decide)!Much better than Unbreakable, not as scary or suspenseful as Signs, and nowhere near as somewhat intriguing or chilling as The Sixth Sense...The Village still entertains in it's own right, though.",4,Helen Keller Meets E.T.

Too many patrons expected one thing and were severed something quite different -- hence the massive let-down that incurs.Part of the problem lies with incessant comparison to Shyamalan's preceding films.  Watch this one anew.  Fresh.  Not expecting it to turn up like a carbon copy of ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs""... never mind ""Unbreakable"", that was awful to begin with.Another contributing factor to the film's less-than-appropriate, sub-par rating is the film's improper promotion.  It was promoted as a sort of horror film, when in actuality it is a film about people, and the extremes we might take to content ourselves.  The previews built the film up into a kind of chill-fest, when what we got once the film was over is a chill of a different kind.""The Sixth Sense"" was scary.  The film featured ghosts.  It was supernatural, and thrilling.  ""Signs"" also hinged on thrill and awe, mystery and fright to achieve it's success.  So no wonder that repeat Shyamalan audiences would expect the same,  legitimate frights.The film fell from its deserving grace due to the tremendous success of its creator, and audience-grabbing promotion.

859801,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00064LJVE,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[15, 17]","I have been accused often enough of ""expectation bias"" coloring my reactions to films.  You know, that's where you go into a film experience expecting (usually) to love it based on a particular actor, writer or director who has thrilled you in the past.  Usually, your standards are so artificially high after all the anticipation that you are almost guaranteed a letdown when you actually see that film.  Then a reverse halo effect takes place in which you find fault with everything in the movie, from the acting on down to the scenery.  You're disappointed, so it all just blew.Strangely enough, although I loved M. Night Shyamalan's previous films, I was not especially disappointed with this departure from his usual subject matter and plotting in The Village.  I enjoyed it despite the fact that it was quite different from what I had been anticipating.  On the other hand this latest offering from the mysterious director of Signs, Unbreakable and Sixth Sense has some well-known movie reviewers practically slinging venom through cyberspace.  What gives?This story takes place in a nameless village somewhere in the eastern region of the US, possibly a cult of some sort, and is set in an undetermined time that looks as if it could be the mid-1800s.  An uneasy truce between the villagers and the enigmatic denizens of the surrounding forest has been in place for an unspecified time, unbroken ""for many years"".  We don't see the beings for a good portion of the film, which allows our imaginations to build them up as we speculate:  Werewolves?  Aliens?  Goblins?  One thing's for sure, they're large and predatory, and if you cross their boundaries they're also vengeful.  So naturally, some id10t villager decides to mess with this pact and breach the woods.  Now, at the worst possible moment, a young man is critically wounded and in need of more advanced medicine from the towns beyond the forest, but of course that would mean aggravating the creatures even more and endangering the life of the person who goes to fetch the drugs.The acting was good in some cases and wonderful for the most part.  I like the fact that while there was a good representation of power names among the cast, the true hero of the story is played by an unknown, Dallas Bryson Howard, with a genuine feel for what makes a smart and determined young woman tick.  For out of the entire town it is Ivy the blind girl who rises to the challenge of saving Lucius in the name of love.  Unbelievably, Ivy is given permission by the Elders to set off alone on her mission with two escorts who must stay back when she gets to the main road. A bit hard to credit, but then wait until you see the kind of savvy the creatures are dealing with in the person of Ivy.The main thing that will disappoint the overly hyped up public, I believe, is the fact that this plot is a Thriller rather than Horror or Speculative Fiction.  It's as if once a director starts off his career in a particular direction, he isn't ""allowed"" by the fans - or mainstream movie critics, for that matter -- to evolve in any other genre.  Get over it, people. I can just hear the praise to high heavens from the professional critics had this movie been made by a newbie director. And yes it has a few too-convenient plot flaws and features people with a more innocent, sedentary mentality than we normally encounter, so what?  Enjoy The Village for the Hitchcock-inspired mood piece that it is, if you are capable of checking your preconceived notions (and game boys) at the door first.The Village will appeal to anybody who appreciates films like Brotherhood of the Wolf, Memento and Identity.

I rarely re-write reviews, but I felt this one deserved it. I was disappointed the first time I saw it, giving the movie just two stars. I've raised it to THREE, (though I can't get the stars (located avove) to change, and while some may say that three still isn't good considering how many people love throwing out fours and fives (I'm one of them), I think three is a good score, shall we say.So what's with the change? After viewing the movie for a second time, this time with my three year old, sophiscated cousin Emily seated at my side (she loves Signs and The Poltergeist), I decided that I didn't give the actors or the script enough kudos the first time. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard are marvelous and have beautiful chemistry that you have to see for yourself. I love the script (though I'm not so sure I quite like everything about the plot). The language is fantastic-- M. Night really deserves accolades for it.The story-- Set in the late 1800s, the villagers live a peaceful, violent free life... oh, except for the terrible monsters that live in the woods which surround their tiny village. The villagers hide the color red because it is ""the bad color"" and attracts the freaky looking, spiky monsters. The color yellow is the good color; yellow banners line the village and watch guards wear yellow capes. Joaquin is Lucius, a quiet guy who is not afraid of ""those they do not speak of,"" only afraid for the welfare of Ivy (Howard). However, the creatures soon begin killing animals and leaving marks on their doors. What does it all mean? And what will happen when, because of dire circumstances I will not reveal here, they must venture into the woods. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Adrian Brody (who plays the ""village idiot,"" Noah, very convincingly), and the funny Judy Greer co-star.Check it out sometime; if you saw it once and hated it, see it again, you may find something you like-- I know I did.

SPOILER WARNING!""The Village"" isn't a real horror movie, but a slow paced science fiction drama. The plot is set in a peaceful, Amish-like village in 1897. The village is ruled by a group of benign Elders (both male and female), and everyone lives a simple, happy, rustic lifestyle.As the story progresses, it becomes more and more obvious that something isn't what it should be. The Elders have dark secrets, and bizarre creatures in red caps occasionally attack the village and its inhabitants. Nobody is allowed to leave the premises. Indeed, almost nobody wants to leave, fearing the supernatural creatures in the woods.The leading Elder, Edward Walker, eventually reveals to his daughter, the blind Ivy, that the entire community is based on a lie: the monsters scaring the inhabitants to remain in the village are the Elders in disguise! The final plot twist reveals that the film is actually set in the present day (2004) and that the village is a kind of cult which has deliberately cut itself off from civilization. The ""dangerous"" woods are part of a wildlife preserve, owned by Walker himself. The movie ends with Ivy returning to the village after visiting the outside world. Since Ivy is blind, it's unclear how much she has understood of the situation, and she opts to keep the secrets her father has already revealed to her. The strange community is allowed to continue.I'm somewhat ambivalent towards ""The Village"". The movie does get too tedious at times, the twist ending would be part-incomprehensible without the Wikipedia exegesis, and the plot is illogical even for a science fiction production (I only told you the good parts!).Yet, ""The Village"" has *something* that makes it tolerable, even good (after a fashion). I'm not sure what, though. Perhaps it's Ivy, perhaps it's the fact that the Elders are tragic rather than evil, or perhaps it actually is the twist ending. I mean, the idea isn't bad! I always get fascinated by science fiction movies on the ""fake world"" theme, such as ""The Matrix"" or ""The Island"". Perhaps I subconsciously suspect that our world *is* a big fake, and that somebody somewhere is hiding something?I really don't know how to rate ""The Village"". Both two, three and four stars are options. When the film is at its most tedious and illogical, it definitely goes down to a two. The twist ending itself is worth four. As a compromise, I give it three stars.

I was surprised at the revelations at the film's end, and enjoyed the whole premise, because the director has crafted a complete and atmospheric setting that appeals to someone willing to think a little bit.Whether or not one sees the plot-twist coming, it's no great fault to ask the question: is the idea of a community in the pastoral embrace of nineteenth century America, with its formal speech and folksy traditions, a worthwhile pursuit in a bewildering, modern time? Moviegoers do not question whether the worlds of Lucas or Tolkien can actually exist - they accept the idea and enjoy the details. Similarily, M. Night Shyamalan asks us to think about how our society (or any society) holds itself together for the benefit of all. In the village, people abide by customs that define conduct and action. There exist contrivances to sustain people's beliefs and adherence to custom - as there are in any society. So whether or not the menace surrounding the village is real, the larger point is that people make degrees of  sacrifices to keep what is good in their lives.A good film can, in the right way, stimulate questions long after the closing credits have rolled. Some viewers questioned how it was that the villagers could create a world without modern conveniences, even asking how the talismanic yellow hoods were manufactured without advanced textiles. Interesting questions, but completely beside the point. One should ask, would the village ""evolve,"" as all societies do? Or, how would the elders reveal to their descendants the secret that keeps the village intact? Perhaps, after all the angles are examined, the best way to view ""The Village"" is as a set-piece, existing in time and yet timeless.The acting is fine overall. I think that William Hurt excels at this sort of restrained, yet passionate character. Joaquin Phoenix proves that he can dial into a deep reservoir of emotion without resorting to hysterics. Adrian Brody is excellent as the disturbed young man whose eccentricities redefine the term ""village idiot."" The best acting comes from Bryce Dallas Howard, whose subtlety and emotion hints at even better work to come. The dialog, contrary to some opinions, is part of what makes this village world work. People have more time for talking (absent TV!) and so make their thoughts known in a way that seems quaint to our ears. But we once did speak in these slow, restrained and simpler ways; just peruse any of Lincoln's writings, or Whitman's poetry. The writing and rationale for ""The Village"" isn't an attempt to make the past seem familiar (like British accents for Roman spectacles); it's a conscious decision to remake thought and life based on long-ago abandoned values.",4,Should be taken on its own merits,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2860,"['Village', 'people', 'different', 'ways', 'found', 'intriguing', 'others', 'hated', 'surprise', 'ending', 'seemed', 'borrowed', 'transparent', 'was', 'surprised', 'revelations', 'film', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'premise', 'director', 'crafted', 'complete', 'atmospheric', 'setting', 'appeals', 'someone', 'willing', 'think', 'little', 'bit.Whether', 'not', 'one', 'plot-twist', 'coming', 'great', 'fault', 'ask', 'question', 'idea', 'community', 'pastoral', 'embrace', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'America', 'formal', 'speech', 'folksy', 'traditions', 'worthwhile', 'pursuit', 'bewildering', 'modern', 'time', 'Moviegoers', 'do', 'not', 'question', 'worlds', 'Lucas', 'Tolkien', 'can', 'actually', 'exist', 'accept', 'idea', 'enjoy', 'details', 'Similarily', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'think', 'how', 'society', 'society', 'together', 'benefit', 'village', 'people', 'abide', 'customs', 'define', 'conduct', 'action', 'exist', 'contrivances', 'sustain', 'people', 'beliefs', 'adherence', 'custom', 'are', 'society', 'So', 'not', 'menace', 'surrounding', 'village', 'real', 'larger', 'point', 'people', 'make', 'degrees', 'sacrifices', 'keep', 'what', 'good', 'lives.A', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'right', 'way', 'stimulate', 'questions', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'viewers', 'questioned', 'how', 'was', 'villagers', 'could', 'create', 'world', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'even', 'asking', 'how', 'talismanic', 'yellow', 'hoods', 'were', 'manufactured', 'advanced', 'textiles', 'Interesting', 'questions', 'completely', 'point', 'One', 'should', 'ask', 'would', 'village', 'evolve', 'societies', 'do', 'how', 'would', 'elders', 'reveal', 'descendants', 'secret', 'village', 'intact', 'Perhaps', 'angles', 'are', 'examined', 'best', 'way', 'view', 'Village', 'set-piece', 'existing', 'time', 'yet', 'timeless.The', 'acting', 'fine', 'overall', 'think', 'William', 'Hurt', 'sort', 'restrained', 'yet', 'passionate', 'character', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'can', 'dial', 'deep', 'reservoir', 'emotion', 'resorting', 'hysterics', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'excellent', 'disturbed', 'young', 'man', 'eccentricities', 'redefine', 'term', 'village', 'idiot', 'best', 'acting', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'subtlety', 'emotion', 'hints', 'even', 'better', 'work', 'come', 'dialog', 'contrary', 'opinions', 'part', 'what', 'village', 'world', 'work', 'People', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'talking', 'absent', 'TV', 'so', 'make', 'thoughts', 'known', 'way', 'quaint', 'ears', 'once', 'did', 'speak', 'slow', 'restrained', 'simpler', 'ways', 'just', 'Lincoln', 'writings', 'Whitman', 'poetry', 'writing', 'rationale', 'Village', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'make', 'past', 'seem', 'familiar', 'British', 'accents', 'Roman', 'spectacles', 'conscious', 'decision', 'remake', 'thought', 'life', 'based', 'long-ago', 'abandoned', 'values']",N/A

I've only seen one before, ""The Woman in the Water,"" and I loved it. As you can see by the stars, I loved this one, too.The Village is in a valley surrounded by woods, and there are monsters in those woods: those of whom we do not speak. There is a sort of contract with the monsters: the people in the Village do not go into the woods, and the monsters do not come into the Village. But the agreement has been violated, and terrible things begin to happen.A few of the citizens of the Village are especially important to the story, but I must not tell you much about the ways in which they are important. Edward Walker is one of the elders, and seems to be rather the leader of the elders, at least as ""first among equals."" The thing is, although they dress very simply, rather like Mennonites, there does not seem to be any special religious aspect to the Village. They came there to get away from the wickedness of the towns, but none of it is very specific.Ivy Walker, Edward's beautiful daughter, is blind. Perhaps that is the reason she has more courage than the rest of the Village; she's had to take risks just to get around.Lucius Hunt is just about the only other person who does not seem afraid, so of course he and Ivy fall in love. Naturally.But there's one more person who matters to the story: Noah Percy, who is some kind of crazy. He's not simply retarded, although perhaps autistic would be accurate. In any case, he's the one who laughs and invites the monsters in rather than being afraid. Or maybe he's afraid, too, but he laughs and invites them in.Gradually we learn that almost everyone among the elders lost a loved one to violence in the towns, and that's the main reason they came to the Village.From here, anything I say might give away the artfully crafted plot, and I do not want to do that. You may suspect, but you will not know what is going on until very near the end. And by that time, how it will play out is every bit as important as what the big secret is.I'm willing to bet you will like this movie.

859813,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00064LJVE,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 5]","There comes a time when a filmmaker might not reach for that intelligent and surprising move in a film that he is known for, and instead will let the wind blow out of his sails and create an ending that will have many scratching their heads and wondering what it was all about. Meaning, that M. Night Shyamalan, who thus far has done no wrong with this viewer, may of gotten the praise and attention of his surprise ""twist"" endings to his head and thought that he could throw any half hearted twist our way and it will be boughten. Such is the case with this movie. The movie actually works better without the so called 'twist' ending, which is mildly amusing, but is so out of left field, even by Shyamalan standards, that it leaves you with a ""that's it?!"" feeling. It is way below his normal ending standards, but the movie up to it works pretty well. Written and directed once again by the man, the trailers and previews for the film may of lead viewers to think it is something else. The movie is not really a scary thriller. It is more of a romantic, period piece, love story. With strange creatures thrown into the mix. What the film has to it's advantage is a supremely superb cast. William Hurt is Edward Walker, the leader of a small village named Covington, who presides over his quaint village that is set around ominous woods. Taking place in the late 1800's, the people of the village lead a simple, closed off from anything, or anyone, life. But all is not serene. There lives scary creatures that lurk in the woods that surround the town. The villagers try to make peace and try to live in harmony, but things will set the fierce creatures off. Mainly, the color red. A color that is so feared, that any sign of it in the village, like a flower or berries, must be immediatley removed and buried. Notice the color of the creatures' robes. Walker's daughter Ivy, wonderfully played by Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard, is a lovely and blind young woman who falls for Lucious Hunt, the quiet and somewhat odd son of Alice Hunt(who is played by Sigourney Weaver). Lucius himself is played by Joaquin Phoenix. See, I said it had a stellar cast!. When tragedies occur, the story shifts from Phoenix and it solely becomes Howard's movie. Her character must make a decision for her one and only love. Oscar winner Adrien Brody also stars in the film as the village idiot, a role that he is excellent in, but many may wonder why he chose a supporting role with virtually no lines after winning the Oscar. Like all of his films, Shyamalan gets a great cast, and he uses them to the fullest, even if not all of them in this movie(sad to say)get much attention. Shyamalan is definitley a a fine storyteller and filmmaker. Even when the movies aren't also hitting on all cylinders, they are still fine pieces of craftsmanship that are done like no other director today. He has a keen eye, and a superb sense of direction of choreography. He films every scene to it's fullest potential, and always makes the most of the scene and the surroundings it's in. Like all of his movies, Shyamalan's work is an acquired taste. Not all get it. Not all appreciate it.

However we also live free form the evils that permeate those other villages beyond the forbidden forest. So what happens when we violate the truce with the other species?The film is produced by M. Night Shyamalan; so there is no surprise in the formula or big picture. It is not hard to figure out the premise shortly into the story. However there are several surprising twists on the way.The acting was surprisingly exceptional. We have well known actors that have the ability not to let their personalities overwhelm their characters.The sets and period costumes were superb. You can see that there was a lot of time and money that went into them. You have the feel that you are there.Although this film may not have achieved the potential in many eyes it is probably one of the best balance and almost believable stories Shyamalan has shown us. It is more than just a tale as we se how people relate and can relate under stress and great joy.The archetype for the movie could have been lifted right out of a Joseph Campbell's book ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"" (1949).

859819,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00064LJVE,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[0, 0]","In his latest film, The Village, Director M. Night Shyamalan has created yet another chilling thriller with a completely unexpected twist at the end.  This time, the setting appears to be a small, turn of the century village.  We soon learn that this seemingly peaceful community is haunted by mysterious creatures who live in the woods which surround the town; for this reason, the residents never wander outside the limits of the village.  Somehow, however, the villagers are able to keep the monsters at bay and continue with their simple existence.Things change suddenly when a young mentally handicapped young man (convincingly played by Adrien Brody) seriously injures one of the other residents (Joaquin Phoenix).  The injured man's fiancee, Ivy, a young blind woman (perfectly portrayed by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron's daughter) is desperate to save her beloved, and so the village elders--including Ivy's own father--agree not only to let Ivy in on some of the community's secrets but also to allow her to leave the confines of the town in search of medicine.  Ivy's experiences in the woods are reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project, causing the viewer to wonder whether evil forces truly exist or not.  A surprise revealation answers this question, but as in Shyamalan's previous works, the real surprise ending is yet to come.When I saw this film in the theater, the final moments were truly unexpected, but the DVD version contains deleted scenes with additional clues to the movie's twists.  Other special features on the DVD include a home movie from the director and a diary by Bryce Howard.  Although this is not my favorite Shyamalan film (The Sixth Sense will probably always have that distinction), it is clear that the director has not lost his touch; he truly knows how to connect with his audience and keep them on the edge of their seats.

The film delivers a rich story of secrets with the elders knowing everything, fear with the 'creatures' of the forests and love between Ivy, a blind girl and the shy Lucius (Joaquin Phoneix).I absolutely adored Phoenix' character in this film. He was mesmerising as the man of a few words but who cared so much for his village. In Gladiator, he showed that he was a formidable actor but in this, he shows he is a man of versatility. Adrien Brody - can he do any wrong in acting terms? No. Once again, he gives the audience a flawless performance as the mentally - handicapped Noah who ultimately brings pain. While Brody and Phoenix are acclaimed actors and justified too, Bryce Howard who played Ivy was simply fantastic.

Night films -- Signs, Unbreakable, and the witty, dark, and exciting The Sixth Sense -- then you might feel a bit let down here. Although this film has many M. Night themes running through it, it doesn't come close to The Sixth Sense in my humble opinion. But it does beat the cr@$ out of most of the DVD junk that's come out lately.The film: The story starts off with a funeral in 1897. A young person has died and been buried in The Village. A father mourns, the young cry, and the elders look on, equally saddened . . . but not for the same reasons. For the elders of The Village harbor secrets; deep, personal secrets that could rip their little community apart.Surrounding The Village is a mysterious forest that moans and creeks eerily. And inside the forest it is known that a horrible creature lives, threatening to disembowel anyone who gets too near its borders or, God forbid, enter the woods.Enter Lucius Hunt (played well by Joaquin Phoenix), a young man who doesn't fear the forest as much as the other villagers and asks the elders permission to go through the forest and into the nearby towns and find new medicines to treat those that might eventually become sick. The elders refuse.During all of these dark goings-ons, a blind girl, Ivy Walker  (Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Howard's daughter), falls in love with Lucius. They plan to marry. But before they can, Lucius is nearly murdered by one of The Village's inhabitants. He must receive medicine or die.Ivy takes on the challenge to walk through the demonic forest and to the towns so that she might find medicine for her dying fiance (initially she goes with two young boys who later chicken-out. After all, she's blind and would need a guide.).But what truly lies beyond the borders of the woods? Will the beasts that live within the forest let her pass? Or will they kill her, too?My biggest beef with the movie was that I figured out what was really going on long before the end of the film (something I was not able to do with The Sixth Sense...and I think M. Night was trying to pull of another ""fooled you"" scenario, but failed miserably).But even WITH this problem, the film was well made; the musical score was excellent; the costumes perfect, the acting superb (especially for new screen star Bryce Howard, whom I think we'll be seeing more of), and the sets stunning.I also have to mention this incredible all-star cast:Bryce Dallas Howard, as Ivy Walker (movie debut)Joaquin Phoenix, as Lucius Hunt (from Signs, Gladiator)Adrien Brody, as Noah Percy (remember him from The Pianist?)William Hurt, as Edward Walker ('nough said)Sigourney Weaver, as Alice Hunt (in a period piece!

I was fully engrossed with the story, so that the weaknesses of the premise which were such an issue with other reviewers didn't mean anything to me.  I was facinated by the interactions of this small band of people isolated from the rest of the world, some battling to keep others controlled by terror, the others battling to live their lives amid the terror.The movie seemed a little modest and unfulfilled in many ways (sometimes like local summer theatre).  There must have been a very limited production budget.  But I was completely engrossed by the subpot involving the blind girl Ivy, and her heroic journey to the towns to get medicine to save the life of the young man she loves.A very special bonus is the remarkable score by James Newton Howard.  I enjoyed the plot and the acting, but this movie wouldn't come close to reaching its emotional impact without the marvelous, emotional music by Mr. Howard, who frequently works on M. Night Shamalan films.I could watch the footage of Ivy's journey a million times, the scenes, the acting by Bryce Dallas Howard, the music, and the cinematography.  It is gripping to every sense.

It was full of suspense and good plot movements.  The first downfall was the appearance of the creatures.  A good adjective to describe these monsters is: cheesy.  They appeared to be straight from a low-budget 1980 horror flick.  And the film never quite redeemed itself.  The storyline became less and less believable; and when the big surprise was revealed, I just had to laugh.  I think that I've seen another movie with the same type of plot, but I can't remember which one.  Anyways, I didn't like it.  I give it two stars because it isn't a horrid movie (the acting was decent), but I would not recommend it to anyone.

859848,A3EW2L59UBHQSG,B00064LJVE,Bruce Aguilar,"[6, 9]","M. Night Shyamalan's films are about surprise endings, having the rug pulled out from under us.  The Village tries to capture the same magic as The Sixth Sense but falls woefully short mainly because we never experience that twist.  The secret of The Village is too easy to figure out.  In fact I think it would be hard NOT to get it before it is fully revealed.  If somehow you haven't figured it out by the time it is revealed, it doesn't pack near the punch of The Sixth Sense.  It's more an ""Oh, OK."" reaction than an ""Oh my God!  I can't believe that!""The movie works best as a study in lighting, acting and cinematography as all are done very well.  Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy is always believable and somehow we easily empathize with her even though she is written one dimensionally.  Aside from an unending somber tone (the actors are rarely allowed to speak above a whisper), the films main problem is story which is impossible to talk about without revealing The Secret.  Suffice it to say that revelations come too early which pulls the audience outside the story and keeps us looking in instead of experiencing the characters terror right along with them.The DVD transfer is very sharp with rich blacks that serve the moody lighting of the film very well.  The Village looks great on DVD.  The included documentary ""Deconstructing The Village"" (the most substantial extra at just under 30 minutes) covers the production in a brisk yet satisfying manner as long as you overlook all the numerous statements about how much like a family the entire cast became.  We've seen this kind of stuff many times before.  The four deleted scenes are bookended by Shyamalan who describes why each was cut in the first place but unlike what the packaging promises no ""clues to the movie's twists and turns"" are revealed.Simply put, The Village is uninspired and flat though sometimes beautiful to look at.  Shyamalan needs to do something completely different for his next film, as his films have become predictable which is the death knell of any mystery/suspense film.  The story rates 1 star.  Production values rates 3 stars.  The DVD rates 3 stars.

With subsequent viewings you appreciate the story and acting even more.Although we still aren't thrilled that the film quality looks cheap, we understand the look they were trying to accomplish. It has been years since an ending surprised me in this way. Not scary but in a way that has you talking to friends and family about the unique story. Suffice it to say that most fans of movies like ""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"", and ""The Others"" will probably like it. The cast is key to making it work and do a wonderful job in their roles. I recommend this movie, and be sure you watch it at least twice before decidng what you think about it.The DVD is great quality and the picture and sound are sharp. The DVD includes Deleted Scenes with director's introductuion, ""Deconstructing The Village"", a look at the making of the film, ""Bryce's Diary"", a M.

I expected to simply see a scary movie about scary things with a predictable twist.  I was surprised and I did have a couple scared moments there.  I have to completely agree with other reviews, that you cannot watch this movie knowing the ending or even much about a few other surprises in the movie.

I watched the movie expecting the only performance to remember would be Joaquin Phoenix.  I was very surprised to be completely on the edge of my seat by the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy).  At first I honestly didn't expect much from her character, but hers is the one I remember best from the movie and the reason I watched it again.

It is supposed to take pace in contemporary America, with the characters disgusted with the criminality and immorality of the modern world, yet they all speak some kind of archaic English better suited fro the 1800s or earlier.  Their descriptions of the ""terror"" and those who cause it are likewise something one would expect to have found in the 1600s, not in modern day.  The clothing also, as well as the way of life of these people is anachronistic, just plain ridiculous.The elders let you know that they have suffered losses in their own lives and in their families in the modern world, so why this pretension of speech and manner.  The story itself is so silly as to be juvenile.  If there is any message at all, such as you can not escape evil, the movie could have been a half hour long and got that across just as well.  But the definition of evil is confused because its perpetrator is not a completely functioning human being, so if there is a message it is not a clear one.  The scary music and dark scenes make for a backdrop of terror, but that terror is false and meaningless.  It seems to me that all the movie had was this setting of a mood, and that was it.

(And if you don't know who Hitchcock is, well in that case, the cameos were an original idea of Shyamalan's.)Shyamalan is also a highly original writer who borrows all his ideas from old Twilight Zone episodes and other assorted sources. These are all homages also. Homages are something that great directors do, and this proves Shyamalan is a great director. Besides, he puts these things in a different order, which takes a lot of skill, darn it.EXTREME SPOILER WARNINGThe Village is a movie about people who spend most of their time speaking about ""the things we don't speak of"". Half of these people are ""Elders"", who spend all their time telling elaborate lies to their children, because they care about them so much. Sort of the way Shyamalan cares about his audience.The Elders hate the wickedness of violence, which is why they regularly dress up as monsters and scare the living cr@p out of their children. This infliction of random fear is actually profoundly symbolic of Shyamalan's homage to himself and his profound ability to impose random fears free from the constraints of meaning.The Elders are deeply compassionate people who bribed airlines to avoid flying over their village, and who send blind girls through pit-infested woods to fetch medicine to maybe heal wounds caused by the Elders own deeply compassionate way of letting retarded people run around with knives. The Elders themselves could not fetch the medicines because they took an oath of stupidity.

859869,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B00064LJVE,Chris,"[6, 7]","I kinda feel bad for M. Night Shyamalan. He has the biggest shoes to fill that any director has had to fill this early in their career. Not only does he have to out-do &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; with every film he makes, he's in the horror genre, which recieves the most criticism out of any movie genre. The huge successes of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Signs&quot; have set the bar so high for himself that it is almost impossible for him to reach it. He may be a director whose first film is the end of his career, if his future projects follow the footsteps of &quot;The Village.&quot;&quot;The Village&quot; is about a group of people in 1897, that live in a village that are surrounded by woods that isolate them from the rest of society. Not only are they isolated from society, creatures live in the woods and as long as the villagers stay within their limits, the creatures won't harm them. One of the village's elder's son get hurt and he needs medication which can only be recieved by going into one of the other towns, which means GOING INTO THE WOODS! The blind girl that is in love with the man that got hurt volunteers to go get the medicine. The story starts to turn when... I'm sorry, I don't want to get sued.The characters in this movie do not really get a chance to &quot;shine.&quot; Bryce Dallas Howard is the only character that really delievers a good performance. I think its kinda ironic, though, that the creatures are attracted to the color red and she was casted to play the blind girl, due to the fact that she has red hair. William Hurt does a good job as well, but none of the other characters get a chance to develop much. M. Night Shyamalan does a great job of telling the story and the setup of the village is amazing. Shyamalan knows how to make a suspenseful scene and he knows how to write a good movie. And yes, there were some twists and I liked the last one, but not the first one.My BIGGEST problem with this movie is that it is advertised as a horror movie. &quot;The Village&quot; is anything but a horror movie. There were two times in the movie that I jumped, but I didn't have that gut feeling like I had in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; that something scary was going to happen. The movie just moved too slow. I believe this was why I was so disappointed with this movie. I have no problem if the movie is not advertised as a horror movie and it is not, cause then I am not expecting to be scared. It was like advertising Casablanca (not to compare to two movies) as a comedy movie. M. Night's trend has been to do one good movie, then one average, then one good, then one average, so hopefully the next one will be really good. Overall, if you like romance mysteries or if you're a big Twilight Zone fan, then see this movie. If you want a horror movie, don't bother seeing this.",3,"Good Movie, Just Not As Advertised",1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,2837,"['kinda', 'feel', 'bad', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'biggest', 'shoes', 'fill', 'director', 'had', 'fill', 'early', 'career', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'out-do', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'film', 'horror', 'genre', 'most', 'criticism', 'movie', 'genre', 'huge', 'successes', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'quot', 'Signs', 'quot', 'have', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'almost', 'impossible', 'reach', 'may', 'be', 'director', 'first', 'film', 'end', 'career', 'future', 'projects', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'quot', 'Village.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Village', 'quot', 'group', 'people', '1897', 'live', 'village', 'are', 'surrounded', 'woods', 'isolate', 'rest', 'society', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'isolated', 'society', 'creatures', 'live', 'woods', 'as', 'long', 'villagers', 'stay', 'limits', 'creatures', 'wo', ""n't"", 'harm', 'One', 'village', 'elder', 'son', 'get', 'hurt', 'medication', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'recieved', 'going', 'one', 'other', 'towns', 'GOING', 'INTO', 'THE', 'WOODS', 'blind', 'girl', 'love', 'man', 'got', 'hurt', 'volunteers', 'go', 'get', 'medicine', 'story', 'turn', 'when', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'sued.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'only', 'character', 'really', 'good', 'performance', 'think', 'kinda', 'ironic', 'though', 'creatures', 'are', 'attracted', 'color', 'red', 'was', 'casted', 'play', 'blind', 'girl', 'due', 'fact', 'red', 'hair', 'William', 'Hurt', 'good', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'none', 'other', 'characters', 'get', 'chance', 'develop', 'much', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'great', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'setup', 'village', 'amazing', 'Shyamalan', 'how', 'make', 'suspenseful', 'scene', 'how', 'write', 'good', 'movie', 'yes', 'were', 'twists', 'liked', 'last', 'one', 'not', 'first', 'one.My', 'BIGGEST', 'problem', 'movie', 'advertised', 'horror', 'movie', 'quot', 'Village', 'quot', 'anything', 'horror', 'movie', 'were', 'two', 'times', 'movie', 'jumped', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'gut', 'feeling', 'had', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'something', 'scary', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'movie', 'just', 'moved', 'too', 'slow', 'believe', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'not', 'advertised', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'cause', 'then', 'am', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'scared', 'was', 'advertising', 'Casablanca', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'movies', 'comedy', 'movie', 'M.', 'Night', 'trend', 'been', 'do', 'one', 'good', 'movie', 'then', 'one', 'average', 'then', 'one', 'good', 'then', 'one', 'average', 'so', 'hopefully', 'next', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'Overall', 'like', 'romance', 'mysteries', ""'re"", 'big', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'fan', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'want', 'horror', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'seeing']",N/A

I don't think so.In my opinion, the negative reviews being thrown around for THE VILLAGE are less about the effectiveness of the movie and its execution, and more about the fact that M. Night Shyamalan is sort of a victim of his own past.  Everyone knows to expect a twist. Based on his previous movies, you know that there is going to be a surprising ending. So, you basically sit down and know to be on the look out for what that surprise is.Has THE VILLAGE been M. Night Shyamalan's first movie... I believe it would have received similar accolades as THE SIXTH SENSE.It is a good movie, for a lot of reasons, but it's certainly not without its faults.The highlight of the film in my book, and for any movie, for that matter, is the lead character... Ivy Walker, played by BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD. The key to any good film is a sympathetic lead character that you can get behind and feel for, hope for and root for. Bryce Howard pulls this off wonderfully.This... to me, is the saving grace of the film.Ivy Walker is a young blind girl, innocent, good-natured, in love and searching for someone to guide her through her life without sight. She is member of a small village that is kept from traveling outside their borders by a band of creatures that inhabit the woods. The rules are many and the creatures aren't tolerant of anyone who breaks them.I won't talk to much about the details of the movie... there is a thin line of explanation that would ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet. But, I will say that the suspense is good. There are shocks. The characters are relateable and sympathetic.Yet, there are problems with THE VILLAGE. The finale, although good and surprising, has some holes in it.My biggest problem was with the final encounter that Ivy has with the creature in the woods. Not the encounter itself, but the creature. I would have found it much easier to believe the creature and why it attacked her had it played out differently. There was another angle that M. Night Shyamalan could have taken to make it much more believeable.This is a weird review to write, because I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen. Yet, I enjoyed THE VILLAGE when I went to see it. In fact, It is one of my favorites of Shyamalan's.I like character driven movies. I like movies that build good character and then build suspense, thrills and action on top of that. Because without good character, NO MOVIE WORKS FOR ME.Check out THE VILLAGE. Rent before buying. If anything, it is certainly a brain twister type movie that reminds us of the days when simple little stories like Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone were the talk of the town.",4,Worthy M.

The actors were so stiff and their way of speaking so stilted. I knew the language was because it is a 19th century village, but it took me a while to get into the flow of the way they talked. Once I did, I really enjoyed this movie. I agree with a lot of other reviewers that the movie only takes off when the character of Ivy comes on-screen. Bryce Dallas Howard did an incredible job with this role.The story is that the village is isolated on one side of the Covington Woods. No one breaches the perimeter and goes into the woods because of creatures that live there. Joaquin Phoenix plays a young man who questions the malevolence of the creatures and tests his theory by entering the woods, if only briefly. The next night the creatures come into the village and leave a warning. Eventually someone in the village needs serious medical attention and in order for him to live, someone must cross the woods to another town to get medicine. This is where the secrets of the town begin to be revealed.I thought M. Night Shyamalan did a great job of giving you creepy glimpses of a rather unique creature, before finally revealing it completely.

Night Shyamalan is the mastermind behind ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", but to me his true genius is showcased in his latest project, ""The Village"". It has received much undeserved critisiscm, IMO, but I am very grateful I remained steadfast in my skepticism about it because I really enjoyed it more than I expected to. I think the problem here is that too many people were misled as to what kind of film it was going to be based alone on the chilling preview seen in theaters, resulting in a lot of preconceived notions. They were thus disappointed. I, however, personally found the plot rather interesting and the movie as a whole to be original and unpredictable with unforeseen twists. I especially appreciated how the trepidition was brought about through atmosphere and sound rather than things jumping out at you, and it was a gutsy move to have the main character (played by the wonderful Bryce Dallas Howard) be blind, which gave the character far more depth... Andrien Brody also did an amazing job at his portrayal of a grown man (Noah Percy) with a child-like disorder, and Joaquin Phoenix as the brave Lucius Hunt who dared to cross into the forbidden woods, as well as being the silent love interest of the innocent young Ivy... The all-star cast was well chosen (I really felt kinship amongst the people, which made it all the more convincing), and the score by James Newton Howard was simple yet haunting--accenting the scenes without overpowering them...Movies like this scare me far worse than blood-thrashing horror flicks, but that is just my opinion so do yourself a favor by giving this the shadow of a doubt and forming your own opinion before listening to everyone elses (to each their own).",5,Spine-tingling suspense,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,1719,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'mastermind', 'Signs', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'true', 'genius', 'showcased', 'latest', 'project', 'Village', 'received', 'much', 'undeserved', 'critisiscm', 'IMO', 'am', 'very', 'grateful', 'remained', 'steadfast', 'skepticism', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'expected', 'think', 'problem', 'here', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'misled', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'based', 'alone', 'chilling', 'preview', 'seen', 'theaters', 'resulting', 'lot', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'were', 'thus', 'disappointed', 'however', 'personally', 'found', 'plot', 'rather', 'interesting', 'movie', 'whole', 'be', 'original', 'unpredictable', 'unforeseen', 'twists', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'how', 'trepidition', 'was', 'brought', 'about', 'atmosphere', 'sound', 'rather', 'things', 'jumping', 'out', 'was', 'gutsy', 'move', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'be', 'blind', 'gave', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'Andrien', 'Brody', 'also', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'portrayal', 'grown', 'man', 'Noah', 'Percy', 'child-like', 'disorder', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'brave', 'Lucius', 'Hunt', 'who', 'dared', 'cross', 'forbidden', 'woods', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'silent', 'love', 'interest', 'innocent', 'young', 'Ivy', 'all-star', 'cast', 'was', 'well', 'chosen', 'really', 'felt', 'kinship', 'people', 'made', 'more', 'convincing', 'score', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'was', 'simple', 'yet', 'haunting', 'accenting', 'scenes', 'overpowering', 'Movies', 'scare', 'far', 'worse', 'blood-thrashing', 'horror', 'flicks', 'just', 'opinion', 'so', 'do', 'favor', 'giving', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'forming', 'own', 'opinion', 'listening', 'everyone', 'elses', 'own']",N/A

There aren't really that many scary things about this film. However, if you walk into it expecting quality drama, acting and storytelling, you might just find something likable about it.M. Night Shyamalan (director of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs,"") brings us an intriguing period piece about love, jealousy, and how far people are willing to go when driven by fear.An ""Amish"" type community resides in an isolated village surrounded by a forest with a dark history. They fear ""those they do not speak of"" who dwell in the woods, and dare not cross their path. But when a dire need of medicine from the towns beyond the woods emerges, one blind woman dares to face the dark in order to bring back the light.The film has an interesting (and creepy) atmosphere to it - a characteristic few movies these days are able to accomplish. One particular shot that comes to mind is between the two main characters, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) and the blind woman Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), when they're talking on the porch. It's a close-up profile shot of them talking, and in between their faces you see a grey fog covering the vast field in front of them - making the audience wonder what's out there watching them. It really symbolizes that not everything may be as it seems.The performances given by William Hurt(AI: Artificial Intelligence), Bryce Dallas Howard, and Joaquin Phoenix really make this film stand on firm ground. But perhaps the most interesting character is that of Noah Percy, played by Adrien Brody (The Pianist). He plays a mentally-challenged, and sometimes unstable man who happens to be in love with Ivy Walker. When he finds out that she's in love with Lucius Hunt, his unstable characteristics really start to take hold of him (as well as creep out the audience).If this were the first film from Shyamalan, it would be critically acclaimed. But since this is his fourth major film, and Shyamalan is now known for putting plot twists in his stories, people go into it immediately starting to second-guess everything they observe. So many people would probably figure out the twist long before the film ends because they're already looking for it. Either that, or they spend the whole film waiting in anticipation for it, only to be let down because they built it up to be the Second Coming. They remember how cool it was to discover what really happened to Bruce Willis' character in ""The Sixth Sense."" But they forget that, at that time, they had never seen a film quite like it before. They had no preconceived notions or expectations.As much as I enjoyed ""The Village,"" I think Shyamalan should stop making films with plot twists for a while and just make some good movies with good stories. And he should not hype it up by advertising it as ""An M. Night Shyamalan Film."" That name is now immediately connected with plot twists and thillers whenever someone sees it. Otherwise, he may very well come to be known as ""M. Night Shyamalamadingdong.""The DVD has some cool features. I didn't find the deleted scenes themselves to be all that interesting, but I liked Shyamalan's commentaries on why they were cut from the film. Bryce Dallas Howard's diary was an interesting feature. For four minutes, we're given her perspective on what it was like filming the movie. We're also given behind-the-scenes featurettes (with the option of playing them all at once) that give us an interesting look at the production of the film. Also included are some production stills, as well as an amusing old home video movie Shyamalan did when he was young that looks strikingly similar to that of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""

It has some problems also, like why or how the mentally unstable kid made the strangely inhuman grunting sounds at the end of the film. Also, why did they need to keep up a facade of being in the 17th century, their children would have no idea what the 17th century was since they grew up in that secluded village and never would of had contact with the outside or modern world. So in reality they could of just dressed like they did and made it 2005, I mean no one but the elders would know what 2005 should look like. They even could of made it the year 3000, the point is the time period did not matter since all the elders knew it was a facade in the first place and the children would of had no idea since they grew up in that village and had no idea what modern was or the year it actually was. Get my point? Also, the monster idea was dumb, I mean wouldn't of someone in the village have tried to kill one of those beasts, someone who did not know what they really were? Like if a bear lived in the woods and supposedly was threatening or had killed a villager, regardless of what the elders said someone should of had the guts to try and kill one of them.

859881,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00064LJVE,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","M. Night Shyamalan is in a way my kind of director: he writes and directs stories that I'm actually interested in. Unlike other films that have stories that I like after I see it, Shyamalan always writes stories that are up my alley and being a big X-Files fan, those stories deal with paranormal stuff. After the rebound success of Signs from the underperforming-but-underrated Unbreakable, we have the Village which boasts a stellar cast, an intriguing premise but several mistteps that make it less than what it should've been.Late 19th century Pennsylvania(it's a given since all his films are based there), there exists a quiet little village that's cut off from everyone else. That's because there exists creatures known as Those We Don't Speak Of and the village has a truce: don't come into our woods, we won't go into your towns. Well some people get restless and need to go outside to fetch medicines but they find out so they start entering the towns and causing panic.Unbreakable felt like a serious stab at creating full characters rather than relying on just shocks and scares so with the Village it feels like a love story at times. One villager loves another but he's in love with her sister who also has feelings for him and his mother has an attraction to the girl's father. Mind you, this ain't incest, far from it, but you're like ""wow, lot of loving in this village"". Casting is excellent with tons of theatre actors and either Oscar, Emmy or Tony winning/nominated actors and they give the film an added credibility. The real find though is Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, who despite questionable blindness acting, is quite a watch and shows a depth. The one misfire and this is not the actor's fault is the village idiot, literally, played by Adrien Brody. Granted Brody does what he can but his role just takes away some of the film. One scene the villagers hear eerie howling sounds from the woods and are unsettled...until the tension's broken when Brody starts laughing in a ""yay, monsters!"" way. Had he been cast as a different character altogether, it would've been better.Now for the creatures themselves. While onscreen a bit more in full view than I would've liked, they do have an otherwordly ""don't mess with us"" feeling but there's 2 faults: one there's not enough. They're not given that much screen time to give the film the dramatic urgency it should and 2) a major revelation concerning the nature of these beasts comes BEFORE a showdown between Bryce's blind Ivy character and the creature. This revelation completely robs what was supposed to be, and kind of is, a suspenseful scene. The first twist ending(obviously no spoilers here)I figured out halfway through and was kind of spoiled beforehand and most likely you will figure it out too but the second caught me off guard since I thought they're was only 1 twists, but nope 2.While it's got its missteps, you should rent it anyways to have a nice scare now and then.",4,A love story set against a creature film...um...okay,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,2975,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'way', 'kind', 'director', 'stories', ""'m"", 'actually', 'interested', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'stories', 'like', 'see', 'Shyamalan', 'always', 'stories', 'are', 'alley', 'being', 'big', 'X-Files', 'fan', 'stories', 'deal', 'paranormal', 'stuff', 'rebound', 'success', 'Signs', 'underperforming-but-underrated', 'Unbreakable', 'have', 'Village', 'stellar', 'cast', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'several', 'mistteps', 'make', 'less', 'what', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been.Late', '19th', 'century', 'Pennsylvania', 'given', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'there', 'quiet', 'little', 'village', 'cut', 'off', 'everyone', 'else', 'creatures', 'known', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Speak', 'village', 'truce', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'woods', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'towns', 'Well', 'people', 'get', 'restless', 'need', 'go', 'outside', 'fetch', 'medicines', 'find', 'out', 'so', 'start', 'entering', 'towns', 'causing', 'panic.Unbreakable', 'felt', 'serious', 'stab', 'creating', 'full', 'characters', 'rather', 'relying', 'just', 'shocks', 'scares', 'so', 'Village', 'love', 'story', 'times', 'One', 'villager', 'love', 'sister', 'who', 'also', 'feelings', 'mother', 'attraction', 'girl', 'father', 'Mind', 'ai', ""n't"", 'incest', 'far', ""'re"", 'wow', 'lot', 'loving', 'village', 'Casting', 'excellent', 'tons', 'theatre', 'actors', 'Oscar', 'Emmy', 'Tony', 'winning/nominated', 'actors', 'give', 'film', 'added', 'credibility', 'real', 'find', 'though', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'daughter', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'who', 'questionable', 'blindness', 'acting', 'quite', 'watch', 'depth', 'one', 'misfire', 'not', 'actor', 'fault', 'village', 'idiot', 'literally', 'played', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Granted', 'Brody', 'what', 'can', 'role', 'just', 'away', 'film', 'One', 'scene', 'villagers', 'hear', 'eerie', 'howling', 'sounds', 'woods', 'are', 'unsettled', 'tension', 'broken', 'when', 'Brody', 'laughing', 'yay', 'monsters', 'way', 'Had', 'been', 'cast', 'different', 'character', 'altogether', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better.Now', 'creatures', 'onscreen', 'bit', 'more', 'full', 'view', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'do', 'have', 'otherwordly', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'feeling', '2', 'faults', 'one', 'not', 'enough', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'give', 'film', 'dramatic', 'urgency', 'should', '2', 'major', 'revelation', 'concerning', 'nature', 'beasts', 'showdown', 'Bryce', 'blind', 'Ivy', 'character', 'creature', 'revelation', 'completely', 'robs', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'suspenseful', 'scene', 'first', 'twist', 'ending', 'obviously', 'spoilers', 'here', 'figured', 'out', 'halfway', 'was', 'kind', 'spoiled', 'beforehand', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'too', 'second', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'thought', ""'re"", 'was', 'only', '1', 'twists', 'nope', '2.While', 'got', 'missteps', 'should', 'rent', 'have', 'nice', 'scare', 'now', 'then']",N/A

859883,A3DTUMLBZCG47D,B00064LJVE,Connor J. Hamilton,"[6, 11]","NOTE: This review contains NO spoilersOk, so they hyped it wrongly. From what I have seen of other reviews, many, many people were expecting this to be a horror film, full of thrills and chills and abominable monsters. But I understand that to a degree--the trailers misrepresented the true nature of The Village. What I find amazing is that many turn around and lambast it for a boring, dull, stupid, and in every way inane movie.Let me tell you...I wasn't expecting a horror film, but I was expecting something different from what I got. What I got, however, turned out to be one of the best movies--if not the best movie--I have ever seen in my life.First of all, it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan. This of its own accord nearly guarantees that the movie will not be bad. He has an impressive track record--The Sixth Sense was superb, Unbreakable was a bit slow but still not bad, and Signs was both a decent alien movie and an excellent story of a man whose faith stagnates and then is revived. The Village, however, trounced them all. He proves as masterful an artist here--if not more so--as ever. His directing is wondrous--you are fully engrossed in Covington Village and its people, and he makes you care about characters who are 3-dimensional, as opposed to Hollywood's typical fare.In one area of this film I think I will have few detractors--the brilliant, moving debut of Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Elizabeth Walker, the spunky, pretty leading lady of the film. Watching the film it is amazing to think that Shyamalan introduced himself after seeing her in a stage production of Shakespeare's As You Like It, and landed her in her first major film role. Her performance is stunning, and I will be disappointed if she does not earn an Oscar for it. She deserves every ounce of it.Joaquin Phoenix as the lead male role, quiet, short-spoken Lucius Hunt, once again proves that he is a versatile actor. Leaving behind him a record of playing the merciless Roman emperor Commodous in Gladiator and the slightly deadbeat Merill Hess in Signs, he appears in The Village playing a completely different part with excellence. Mr. Phoenix is only 29 years old...he has a career cut out for him.All the supporting roles-Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, and others-are equally good. This was the first film in which I had seen Adrien Brody, and I found his performance as mentally unstable Noah Percy to be quite fine, and without having seen it I can imagine why he got an Oscar for his role in the Pianist.One objection I often see in reviews is that this movie was not scary. Well, no, it wasn't, really, in the killer-with-bloody-knife sort of way, nor was it intended to be. But it was suspensful in plenty. It is bad enough when someone is going into danger, but when that person is a blind woman, things start getting more-ok, I take it partly back-scary. So if you are looking for the sort of scariness that will keep you awake night after night, stay away. But if you are looking for some whopping-good suspense, then you just might be interested. You must be prepared, however, to head into a moving, entertaining, stirring-but mercifully clean-love story, filled with good characters, excellent directing, and some good questions to think and talk about.Oh, and the soundtrack. Superb. Hilary Hahn, the featured violinist, struts her stuff in some really wonderful violin themes. It is very classically based stuff, and extremely good-and very appropos to what it accompanies in the film...which is always a plus.From stem-to-sterm, top-to-bottom, front-to-back, side-to-side, this is an excellent film, and perhaps Shyamalan's best to date. He is going to have difficulty topping this. Instead of blasting him for a boring film maker, please, even if the movie isn't your type, recognize him for the superb director that he is.

The denizens kept within the boundaries of the town not venturing into the surrounding woods, supposedly home to murderous creatures.  The movie progresses into a preposterous set of circumstances as Joaquim Phoenix gets injured and is need of outside intervention.  The ending proves the movie to be downright stupid.The acting was non existent with the notable exception of Adrien Brody playing the demented Noah.  William Hurt, a good actor playing the leader of The Vilage was whiny.

Is it because I'm a Hitchcock aficionado? No. I just have an ability to read narrative arcs and see where things are going. It was obvious that Bruce Willis was dead in The Sixth Sense, that Samuel L. Jackson was the bad guy in Unbreakable, and that, well, Signs sucked altogether. Perhaps I demand too much, ot perhaps it's because I see in MNS a burgeoning Spike Lee or Steven Spielberg- i.e.- someone with a great eye but no knack for storytelling. My advice: become a cinematographer, or write better tales! This, especially, goes out to MNS, since he writes his films, and all are `twist ` films- dependent upon that final reveal.This film had potential to be as great a work of art as that other great fictive The Village- from the 1967 tv show The Prisoner, but it fails miserably on all levels. MNS wouldn't know a well-written script if you beat him with it. Am I repeating myself? Let me range a little more- I am tired of mere cinematographers posing as auteurs. Learn narrative arcs. Perhaps I do expect too much- like character development, plausible plots, etc. and tales not based on a twist, but situations that logically and/or organically grow out of situation.Yet, a quick review of professional critics' reviews was astounding, for most seemed to miss that this was a film not set in the 19th Century- instead believing that some time tripping had occurred. As for the extras? There's no commentary, thankfully, for the featurettes are fellatric enough- including a heinous diary by Bryce Howard, and an execrable bit of another of MNS's bad home movies from childhood. He seems to put far more care into his childhood films selected for the DVDs than he does his actual grown up films. In short, MNS delivers another film with a good premise, but lousy execution in all aspects. I've given up on him as a film director, but I'm sure he's got his next twist film already in the works.

Night Shyamalan, The Village, especially after the marketing campaign that promises intense thrills and scares. It is not that the film does not offer these, but they are not the main force behind it. After a huge letdown involving the expected twist ending, the film becomes a haven for thought-provoking ideas about society and our reactions to it.The year is 1897 (according to the tombstone of a child who dies before the movie begins). A small village of people live in fear of ""those we don't speak of"" -- creatures who live in the nearby Covington Woods, a forest that borders -- and separates the village from -- ""the towns,"" the location of seemingly even more awful things that the people in the village avoid. Only the mentally-challenged Noah (Adrien Brody of The Pianist) seems to be unafraid of the noises the creatures make. Everyone else is terrified and children play games to see who can stand longest with his back to the woods before becoming scared. This, even though a presumed truce between the creatures and the villagers keep their domains separated by a mysterious truce based on mutual respect.Meanwhile, love is developing in the village: the quiet Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix, doing his usual secretive moody shtick) has fallen for Ivy (newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of actor/director Ron Howard), the blind daughter of village elder Edward Walker (William Hurt). The chemistry between Phoenix and Howard is the centerpiece of the film, and its believability is the rock that still manages to support much of writer Shyamalan's flawed script.Director Shyamalan builds his world beautifully with a wonderful use of color (marvelously captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins) as his characters portray their horror of the known and unknown. ""The bad color"" (red) is to be avoided entirely, as it attracts ""those we don't speak of"" while yellow is the good color, shown by the wearing of yellow cloaks when on the boundaries of Covington Woods. These colors take on lives of their own as events happen to cause ""those we don't speak of"" to break their truce and cross over into the village.When Lucius is wounded, Edward allows Ivy to make the trek through the woods to the towns to get medicine for him. This scene is the beginning of the revelation and I can go no further but to say that this Little Yellow Riding Hood's love for her beau makes her fearless despite her disadvantage and that a forest hasn't been this frightening since The Blair Witch Project.Though the cast contains such revered actors as Hurt, Phoenix, Brendan Gleeson, and Sigourney Weaver, the true star of The Village is Howard. Her Ivy is the heart of the film and she is more than up to the challenge. Her blindness is never questioned and Ivy goes through every conceivable emotion with nothing but sincerity. She's nice to look at, too. despite the fact that this is her film debut (she worked on the stage for a time, developing her craft under the name Bryce Dallas).I, too, was highly disappointed by the revelation of the ""secret"" (Shyamalan's stock in trade; it seems he is unable to write a story than can stand on its own merits), but The Village has much more going for it if you can stay with it -- after being led through a sea of deception -- pay attention to the myriad emotional layers below the surface. This change is jarring, and could undoubtedly have been done better, but the movie is rewarding in its own way. The ending is a bit jarring, but where else could it really go? This is definitely going to be a film that will seem better on the second viewing as all (well, most) of Shyamalan's do; his worlds seem to be hermetically sealed against inconsistencies.",4,Thought-provoking emotional thriller,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,3807,"['doubt', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'new', 'film', 'writer/director/producer', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Village', 'especially', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'intense', 'thrills', 'scares', 'not', 'film', 'not', 'offer', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'force', 'huge', 'letdown', 'involving', 'expected', 'twist', 'ending', 'film', 'haven', 'thought-provoking', 'ideas', 'society', 'reactions', 'it.The', 'year', '1897', 'according', 'tombstone', 'child', 'who', 'movie', 'small', 'village', 'people', 'live', 'fear', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'creatures', 'who', 'live', 'nearby', 'Covington', 'Woods', 'forest', 'borders', 'village', 'towns', 'location', 'seemingly', 'even', 'more', 'awful', 'things', 'people', 'village', 'avoid', 'Only', 'mentally-challenged', 'Noah', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Pianist', 'be', 'unafraid', 'noises', 'creatures', 'make', 'Everyone', 'else', 'terrified', 'children', 'play', 'games', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'longest', 'back', 'woods', 'becoming', 'scared', 'even', 'presumed', 'truce', 'creatures', 'villagers', 'keep', 'domains', 'separated', 'mysterious', 'truce', 'based', 'mutual', 'respect.Meanwhile', 'love', 'developing', 'village', 'quiet', 'Lucius', 'Hunt', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'doing', 'usual', 'secretive', 'moody', 'shtick', 'fallen', 'Ivy', 'newcomer', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'daughter', 'actor/director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'blind', 'daughter', 'village', 'elder', 'Edward', 'Walker', 'William', 'Hurt', 'chemistry', 'Phoenix', 'Howard', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'believability', 'rock', 'still', 'support', 'much', 'writer', 'Shyamalan', 'flawed', 'script.Director', 'Shyamalan', 'world', 'beautifully', 'wonderful', 'use', 'color', 'marvelously', 'captured', 'cinematographer', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'characters', 'portray', 'horror', 'known', 'unknown', 'bad', 'color', 'red', 'be', 'avoided', 'entirely', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'yellow', 'good', 'color', 'shown', 'wearing', 'yellow', 'cloaks', 'when', 'boundaries', 'Covington', 'Woods', 'colors', 'take', 'lives', 'own', 'events', 'happen', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'break', 'truce', 'cross', 'village.When', 'Lucius', 'wounded', 'Edward', 'Ivy', 'make', 'trek', 'woods', 'towns', 'get', 'medicine', 'scene', 'beginning', 'revelation', 'can', 'go', 'further', 'say', 'Little', 'Yellow', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'love', 'beau', 'fearless', 'disadvantage', 'forest', ""n't"", 'been', 'frightening', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project.Though', 'cast', 'contains', 'such', 'revered', 'actors', 'Hurt', 'Phoenix', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'true', 'star', 'Village', 'Howard', 'Ivy', 'heart', 'film', 'more', 'up', 'challenge', 'blindness', 'never', 'questioned', 'Ivy', 'conceivable', 'emotion', 'nothing', 'sincerity', 'nice', 'look', 'too', 'fact', 'film', 'debut', 'worked', 'stage', 'time', 'developing', 'craft', 'name', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', '.I', 'too', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'revelation', 'secret', 'Shyamalan', 'stock', 'trade', 'unable', 'write', 'story', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'Village', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'can', 'stay', 'being', 'led', 'sea', 'deception', 'pay', 'attention', 'myriad', 'emotional', 'layers', 'surface', 'change', 'jarring', 'could', 'undoubtedly', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'movie', 'rewarding', 'own', 'way', 'ending', 'bit', 'jarring', 'where', 'else', 'could', 'really', 'go', 'definitely', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'better', 'second', 'viewing', 'well', 'most', 'Shyamalan', 'do', 'worlds', 'seem', 'be', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'inconsistencies']",N/A

859890,A3I2E820C9T4YA,B00064LJVE,"C.T. Chase ""cchase8860""","[2, 5]","You couldn't have possibly missed the commotion and controversy surrounding M. Night's most recent film, unless you had temporarily been living on the moon, (and even then, you still might've heard about it.) I waited so long to review this movie, because I figured that in time it would come into its own with audiences, and I think that time has definitely come today. In a world where pallid remakes of ""House Of Wax,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" can be considered box-office hits, the artistry and originality of THE VILLAGE now seems more worthy of appreciation than it did upon its initial release.Without giving away any of the fabled ""twists,"" this much I can tell you: a small village of Amish-or-Quaker-like inhabitants dwells on the edge of the Pennsylvania woods sometime in the 1800's. The town elders, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson and Sigourney Weaver amongst them, maintain a sense of benevolent authority over all...save in one respect. A 'truce' of sorts has long been maintained between The Villagers and an unknown, unseen number of entities, ""Those Of Whom We Do Not Speak,"" who dwell deep in the surrounding woods. The conflict between the two groups that inspired the truce is never fully explained, but the rules binding it definitely are. The Villagers have sworn never to violate the sanctity of the woods where the creatures live, and in return, they have pledged to stay clear of The Village.The silent but stalwart Lucius Hunt, (Joaquin Phoenix), bravely volunteers to breach the woods in search of vital medicines, when one of the children dies of an illness that needn't have been fatal. Lucius has never held much truck in the truce anyway, and now he has a reason to discover exactly what it is that lies beyond the wooded boundaries. The remainder of the movie encompasses as much about what happens when the 'truce' is eventually broken, as it does some startling revelations about the restless secrets being concealed within the confines of The Village itself, and its fearful inhabitants. Most of this part of the story could be gleaned from the long-form version of the sensational yet deceptive trailers that attracted moviegoers to this film in droves.And since that is as much as I dare say about the movie itself, let's turn to those trailers for a moment. Even if ""Night"" had done a remake of Tim Burton's MARS ATTACKS!, he has unfortunately been cursed by the strength of THE SIXTH SENSE, with a reputation for being the guy who comes up with the nifty twists and the ""shocker"" endings for all of his films. Which is very similar to the quandary that Orson Welles must've found himself in when he exploded into the cinematic firmament with his masterpiece, CITIZEN KANE. How does a filmmaker top something that remarkable?Yet, though the quality of the finished product has been debatable for a few years now, the way the trailers handicapped the movie certainly isn't. Film buffs expecting the kind of wallop packed by SENSE were already doomed to disappointment, and were extremely vocal about their displeasure, since the previews seemed to promise a neo-Gothic thriller that held as many surprises as that previous effort. Sci-fi/fantasy/horror fans went expecting a goosebumpy, gratuitously gory ride from the same trailers, and with the exception of one horrifying scene that is all the more powerful BECAUSE of its restraint, they also walked away grumbling about how much it 'sucked.'So, here we are a few years after its provocative theatrical run. If you've heard about it but never seen it, and you know nothing about it, what does it have to offer you now that would make it worth two hours of your precious time?First of all, it is still a timely post-9/11 allegory about how when you balance a ""culture of life"" with one of fear, falling off of that precarious balance between the two comes at a terrible price, no matter how well-intentioned the reasons are for it. (Which is the last thing I'll say about the plot. The rest you can figure out for yourself.)There are many great actors and some beautifully modulated performances here from all involved. There have been complaints that not enough character development or backstory was allowed with the bulk of the characters, but as the majority of the film really belongs to only three of them, the reasoning behind this is now completely understandable.Besides Joaquin Phoenix's top-drawer rendering of the decent-and-not-quite-dutiful Lucius, the acting world got a stunning introduction to a remarkable new talent. Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of prolific filmmaker Ron, made her unforgettable debut here as Ivy, daughter of Hurt's town elder, and nearly unrequited love interest of Lucius. She commands every scene she's in with graceful restraint and natural charisma, and she deserves every accolade she received for this performance. (Not a surprise that Lars Von Trier tapped her for his next film, MANDERLAY.)As equally powerful and unfortunately underpraised, is Adrian Brody. At first blush, it would seem puzzling that he would accept such a small role in a large ensemble cast, considering the spectacular and much deserved kudos (and the Oscar) he received for THE PIANIST. But seeing what he does with his role as the slow, sweet-natured best-pal-from-childhood of Lucius and Ivy, you will come to realize why his Oscar win was no fluke.The bulk of the movie actually belongs to these three fine actors, and THAT'S as much as I can say about their part in it.Without stretching this review out into novel length, in closing, I want to defend THE VILLAGE with one last comment...If you saw it when it first came out and decided you didn't like it one bit, give it another try now. You may STILL think it's subpar, especially from a filmmaker with Shymalan's rep, but give it another shot. I can't promise you that you will absolutely love it now, but you may make some surprising discoveries you didn't before, and might even come to like it just a little bit.To the few film buffs who bought into the negative hype and didn't see it at all, give it a shot. You may find your fears about it validated, or you might kick yourself in the butt for not taking the leap sooner.Oh, and for those not into story development or subtlety, you may want to steer clear. (And yes, this means YOU, fans of SEED OF CHUCKY, HOUSE OF THE DEAD or RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE.)",4,Better Now Than Ever Before....,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,6413,"['could', ""n't"", 'have',

Instead of focusing on one protagonist as he has done in his previous films, he has shifted the focus to an ensemble drama. It is also his first period drama in which the fantastical elements are brought into question. It was also his first commercial failure. After a strong opening weekend and a critical response that ranged from indifference to hostility, the film disappeared quickly from theatres. Now that all the dust has settled, The Village deserves another look.Deconstructing The Village"" is a 25-minute featurette on the making of M. Night's movie. This extra explores various aspects of the production, from casting to editing and sound. For standard press kit material it is refreshingly substantial.There are four deleted scenes introduced by M. Night. He puts them in context and explains why he ultimately cut them from the film.""Bryce's Diary"" features the young actress reading from her diary that she kept while making the movie. It mostly involves her gushing about her co-stars and working on a big-time Hollywood movie.""M. Night's Home Movie"" continues a tradition with his DVDs of including one of the short films he made as a kid. This one is a cute recreation of the famous opening scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark with M. Night playing Indiana Jones.Finally, there is a gallery of 38 behind-the-scenes photos of M. Night working with his actors.Ultimately, traditional horror film fans will feel cheated by the last third of The Village. It betrays its initial supernatural inclinations in favour of M. Night's trademark humanistic message: that we are our own worst enemy. The problem with this film and with all of his films is that there are very little gray areas. There is either good or bad people. At first, the villagers seem to have many gray areas but by the end of the film it is back to good and bad. It's too bad because somewhere in The Village there is a good film trying to get out and if M.

It just took a while for those who emerged from theaters declaring The Village a two-hour life support system for a twist ending to appreciate that there's a lot more to this movie than its concluding surprise. (No, I won't give it away, even if by now nearly everyone surely knows what that surprise is, but if you don't know, be careful about reading any farther.) What I grasped about The Village, aside from embracing a story I liked for itself, and for its ending which I didn't see coming, was a message of optimism that said it is possible for people to escape the boundaries and rules of an oppressive time and place, and recreate reality to suit their preferences. Think about that for a minute. People go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today, for instance, with its violence, its corporate intrusions, its governmental omnipresence, and here we saw a successful  experiment in utopian existence set in 1890, and I found that wonderful. I also loved the scenery, the muted color schemes, the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life. The performances of Bryce Dallas Howard, Joachim Phoenix, and William Hurt were also highly underrated. Never has a stretch of bare woods surrounding a meadow looked so foreboding. Never has the monster in the fairy tale been so close at hand.

Night Shyamalan has trouble finding his footing with his fourth feature film, and it becomes apparent about half way through that a man we once thought could become the next Hitchcock may end up nothing more than a one hit wonder.  The film as a whole was horribly miss-advertised, promoted as a thriller when it becomes a film more about loyalty and love than anything else.The twist ending, instead of impressing us and scaring us all the more (just think how you felt when you realized Bruce Willis was really dead, or when you realized Samuel Jackson was indeed a crazed killer...Goosebumps), ends up ruining everything that Shyamalan works so hard to establish in the films outset.  That's the biggest problem right there...you find out the twist ending to early...and then Shyamalan again tried to scare you and it comes off comical and campy, and campy is NOT what Shyamalan was going for, I'm sure of that.The beginning of this film, maybe even the first three quarters, is effectively ominous, but once the big secret is revealed all eerie overtones flee and they will never be repeated, so as a thriller this film falls flat on it's face for there is no way that this film will even be remotely scary the second time around.BUT...as a dramatic love story this movie actually works wonders (aside from the one campy chase scene in the woods that would have been much more effective had the `fake' looking quote-unquote creature remained hidden throughout).  The acting in this film is top-notch, and the chemistry between stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is undeniable.  Adrian Brody is successful in portraying the village handicap and Jayne Atkinson is wonderfully used as Ivy's (Howard) sister.This is why I'm so torn because my initial reaction is to hate this film for pretending to be something it's not, for tricking me into thinking I was going to have a spine-tingling good time and instead serving up a romance of sorts, but I can't get too upset for this romantic drama is actually a very good one.So, in closing, this is not the movie you think it's going to be, but that doesn't mean it's not a movie you should see.  I say everyone see for themselves, but watch with an open mind, knowing full well this is not another `Sixth Sense', not even another `Unbreakable' but it's something altogether different, altogether it's own and shows that while Shyamalan may have lost touch with what is truly terrifying, he still knows how to tell a story (aside from the horrendous `Lady in the Water').",3,"To love or hate, like or dislike...it's every man for himself on this one!",1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2530,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'trouble', 'finding', 'footing', 'fourth', 'feature', 'film', 'apparent', 'way', 'man', 'once', 'thought', 'could', 'become', 'next', 'Hitchcock', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'nothing', 'more', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'film', 'whole', 'was', 'horribly', 'miss-advertised', 'promoted', 'thriller', 'when', 'film', 'more', 'loyalty', 'love', 'anything', 'else.The', 'twist', 'ending', 'instead', 'impressing', 'scaring', 'more', 'just', 'think', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'realized', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'was', 'really', 'dead', 'when', 'realized', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'was', 'indeed', 'crazed', 'killer', 'Goosebumps', 'up', 'ruining', 'everything', 'Shyamalan', 'so', 'hard', 'establish', 'films', 'outset', 'biggest', 'problem', 'right', 'there', 'find', 'out', 'twist', 'ending', 'early', 'then', 'Shyamalan', 'again', 'tried', 'scare', 'off', 'comical', 'campy', 'campy', 'NOT', 'what', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'going', ""'m"", 'sure', 'that.The', 'beginning', 'film', 'maybe', 'even', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', 'effectively', 'ominous', 'once', 'big', 'secret', 'revealed', 'eerie', 'overtones', 'flee', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'repeated', 'so', 'thriller', 'film', 'flat', 'face', 'way', 'film', 'will', 'even', 'be', 'remotely', 'scary', 'second', 'time', 'around.BUT', 'dramatic', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'actually', 'wonders', 'aside', 'one', 'campy', 'chase', 'scene', 'woods', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'had', 'fake', 'looking', 'quote-unquote', 'creature', 'remained', 'hidden', 'acting', 'film', 'top-notch', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'undeniable', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'successful', 'portraying', 'village', 'handicap', 'Jayne', 'Atkinson', 'wonderfully', 'used', 'Ivy', 'Howard', 'sister.This', 'why', ""'m"", 'so', 'torn', 'initial', 'reaction', 'hate', 'film', 'pretending', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'tricking', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'spine-tingling', 'good', 'time', 'instead', 'serving', 'up', 'romance', 'sorts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'upset', 'romantic', 'drama', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'one.So', 'closing', 'not', 'movie', 'think', 'going', 'be', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'movie', 'should', 'see', 'say', 'everyone', 'see', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'not', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'not', 'even', 'Unbreakable', 'something', 'altogether', 'different', 'own', 'Shyamalan', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'touch', 'what', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'still', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'aside', 'horrendous', 'Lady', 'Water']",N/A

And it really isn't that scary.  But I really enjoyed the acting, plot, and filming of this movie.  I think this may be William Hurt's best performance to date.  Bryce Dallas Howard was amazing as the blind heroine Ivy Walker.  And of course, Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix performed brilliantly.  Brody was a very convincing love-smitten (that friendship kind of love, I assume), mentally retarded young man who fancied the beautiful Ivy Walker.I actually thought the ending was very interesting.  I don't want to give away any of the movie, but I do believe this movie makes one think about society and how much influence it plays in shaping our minds.  I believe we (humans) need to think about how the constant bombardment of negative influences (terrible news stories, hate, political propaganda, etc.) affects us.  This movie really makes one examine those issues.This is also a movie that examines one-on-one friendships and conversations.  The Village is not a scary movie, but the concept of society flowing along without realizing how it manipulates the human mind is indeed, scary.This movie is worth the watch.

The bedrock is not the twist of the Sixth Sense, or the gore of a slasher movie.  Instead it is a luminescent, 19th century romance amid a dark and cloudy world.  If you can accept a romance movie by M. Night Shyamalan, you will find ample rewards in the rich acting of the two leads, including newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix.  Fear plays a role, but scaring the audience is not the point of the movie.  Love plays a larger role.  Expectations influence how a movie is received.

859898,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00064LJVE,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[6, 9]","M. Night Shyamalan's star has fallen of late, and he has plunged from the Hollywood heavens like Lucifer himself. Once venerated as a brainy horror wunderkind fresh from his ""Sixth Sense"" triumph, Shyamalan is now reviled as a ""hack"" director, the consequence of disappointing his audience with ""Signs"" and now ""The Village"".Both movies, through masterful trailers, promised their audience something big---and committed the brutally unforgivable sin of not delivering.Is ""The Village"" a bad movie? Not at all.Is ""The Village"" a grip-your-partner-in-sheer-Unholy-Terror kind of flick? Not at all.Shyamalan is an interesting director: interesting in that he takes mainstream cinematic tropes and turns them on their head, puts them under an electron microscope, boring into their guts. He did it in ""Sixth Sense"" with ghosts, again in ""Unbreakable"" with superheroes, again in ""Signs"" with alien invasion, and does so once more with ""The Village"", which chronicles our fear of death and the unknown.And this time, perhaps, Shyamalan struck a little too close to home: in our rapidly darkening age of gated high-security enclaves, hundreds of pass-codes for everything from voice mail to credit card accounts, identity theft, and the looming spectre of another terrorist horror, the question is---what are we willing to surrender for happiness, security, and safety?So---with Shyamalan's ""The Village"", we are introduced to the denizens of the eponymous settlement circa 1896. The village alderman, mayor, hetman, whatever Edward Walker (played by a slow-phlegm-talking but note-perfect William Hurt) is burying one of the dead. Cut from the funeral to a communal feast, where hooting and bellowing sounds from the encircling Covington Woods, which elicits approving laughter from the Village Idiot Noah Percy (done to the T by Adrien Brody).There is a truce, between the humans of Covington Village and the surrounding woods. Do not display the color Red, for the things which inhabit the thickets around the township hate it. Do not venture into their woods. And---I dunno, I forget---I think if you hear the alarm sound, hide beneath your covers, for They are coming. Whatever ""They"" are. Brrrr.And so, for years this isolated little hamlet has lived in an uneasy truce with the unseen but deeply feared creatures in the forest. All is well, until, as always happens in fairy tales, somebody breaks the Rules.I think people want to be deliciously, creepily spooked; certainly that's what ""The Village"" promised, at least on the surface. But that's not really what ""The Village"" is about: think more a kind of extended ""Anne of Green Gables"" Halloween special.Now: in the final analysis, people hated ""The Village"" because the trailers for the flick painted it as the ultimate horror film: a movie about pure fear sauntering out of the woods, pressing its Night Gaunt face up against the windowpane, and peering in at you while you sleep.Frankly, that's not what ""The Village"" is about. I'm not going to go into what it's really about, other than to suggest you keep an open mind: the gorgeous cinematography, the initial lurking fear, and the amazing acting (particularly Bryce Dallas Howard, simultaneously blind and the sexiest thing I have seen on this planet in her role as the luscious Ivy Walker) merit it.Yes it's contrived. Yes it fails the ""truth in advertising"" smell test. Yes it's brilliant and scary and moving and more than a little sad.

Honestly, I don't know how you can not like this movie.Not only did I enjoy it the first time, it's the kind of movie I can watch over and over.  M. Night admits in one of the DVD extras that he probably should have marketed it as a love story (it is), as opposed to a thriller.  Whatever.  I didn't have any preconceived notions or expectations going in.  I just watched it, not knowing what I was in for, and I wasn't at all disappointed.The soundtrack is excellent, and the use of sound is masterfully done.  If you have a good surround sound system, turn down the lights, crank it up, and just take in the atmosphere of the film.I am utterly amazed at the negative reviews.  The personal attacks on M. Night are beyond puzzling, as if he's committed a crime or something.  It's funny how people will on the one hand complain that a movie is too predictable, or lacks imagination, etc.  Then a movie like this comes along, and people complain anyway.  Some people are never happy.  It's just a movie, people!!  Relax !The characters in the film are excellent.  The pace of the film is good.  I always come away at the end wishing it weren't over yet.

859902,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00064LJVE,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[7, 7]","I grew up in a very conservative Christian home.  I remember hearing about how the world is slipping down a moral slope.  With prayer in school gone and the lie of ""separation of church and state"" permeating our society.  We as American's have lost those Judeo-Christian ideals that the founding fathers put in place.  Hence we were a fallen nation, and that's why there are so many problems in this Country.While I'm not asking anyone whose reading this to embrace these ideas, they permeate M. Knight Shyamalan's new film ""The Village.""  An intriguing motion picture that asks and yet never quite answers the questions many American's are asking in this post 9/11, postmodern, and enlightened period.THE VILLAGE is a quaint little place far from the bustling ""towns"" of evil and greed.  It's a 19-century prairie town, and a utopia where decent people live out their lives in peace and modest prosperity.  Money is not and issue, for the people of THE VILLAGE have no need of it.  They all speak and act like Quakers, and hold close to traditional family values.Of course THE VILLAGE has its own local government.  It is ruled by board of elders, who are strict but fair.  There seems to be only one rule, ""Stay Out of Covington Forrest.""You see the forest is the only problem with the Village. It's full of monsters.  As long as the people stay out of the wood The Monsters leave them alone. The other problem is that The Village needs some basic drugs to save its people.  As the film opens we see the casket of a young boy who died because he did not have simple medicine's to keep him alive.  It's a scary existence but there is peace, so it might just be a trade off? Or is it?THE VILLAGE is the type of movie I personally love.  It is a film about subtext.  But what gives the film its spark is the fact that it doesn't play its message at you. But you only realize this if you give it some time and patience.  If you overlook its flaws, what you'll find is a movie that speaks to any audience.  Without being preachy and overwrought.It plays with some of the things we as American's have gotten used to in these dark times.  The color terror alert systems, false terror alarms, and presents people like you and me, people who want to go about their days without having to worry about the darkness hiding in the woods.  THE VILLAGE is a typical suburban town, if it was transplanted onto the prairie.I loved the scene with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix, GLADIATOR) and Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard, The Grinch) as they sit on the porch in the middle of the night and preach their love to each other.  The scene is alive with energy and light.  Shyamalan frames the shot so close up, you feel like your part of the action, and the actors turn the stilted Quaker like dialogue on its head.Howard is just phenomenal.  She fills her character with color.  The other actors around her seem weighed down by the stilted dialogue, which I'll admit takes some getting used to.  Howard enchants from the very first frame and commands the audience's eyes.  Like a young Holly Hunter mixed with Julia Roberts, Bryce Howard has the potential to be the next big thing. Watch out pop a couple years from now we could have another Oscar winner in the family.The other bright spot in the film is Adrien Brody (The Pianist) he portrays Noah the town retard.  Man did he have a good time.  There is energy in his portrayal that just gushes with enthusiasm.  It looks like he's having a ball.  I'll admit there was one moment I thought he was laying it on a little too much.  But I'll forgive him that small moment cause he's just dead on the rest of the time.At its heart THE VILLAGE is social commentary for both sides of an argument.  For some they will look at these characters and think them pathetic.  Why give up your freedom for safety?  Why allow the government to fuel your fears?  But other will look at these characters and say ""isn't it great that these people got away from the horror of this world? Isn't it wonderful that they created a utopia?  I wish I lived in The Village, free from all the evil influences of the world at large.""As for the patented surprise ending, it works... sort of.  If you give the movie its due you'll be satisfied.  I smelled it from a mile away and still took a lot away from the movie.  If you don't buy the premise you'll be let down and hate the movie.  But that's okay.  Great movies don't have to be universally loved, as long as you don't leave the theater indifferent the movie will have an effect on you.

It is reminiscent of similar closed societies that have made headlines over the last few decades and left one feeling decidedly grateful that one was not a part of this one. I can tell you, however, there is no Kool-Aid involved in the ending.The elders have identified an outside threat from which the village must be defended and the members of the community are never allowed to forget the dangers lurking outside. Although they understand there are towns outside, these towns are places of evil which must be avoided.The storyline of the movie is based on a need to dare these dangers in order to bring in some needed supplies from outside. The one that circumstances elects just happens to be blind so that further complicates the journey. Some interesting plot twists are revealed which helps make sense of the overall situation; the viewer begins to get background information which explains what has happened in the past that helped shape the village into what we see during the movie.There is some good suspense built up with the settings and the acting contributing to the whole process. I found it difficult to relate to any of the characters and had some difficulty really caring what happened to them.

I beilieve that is an incorrect assessment.The Village is a truly beautiful film which tells one of the finest love stories in many years.  The performances by all are top-notch, especially by the two leads, Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard.  The dialogue and usage of symbolism are exceptional, yet only part of the movie's many charms.  The first time I tried to watch the movie, I found it slow and uninvolving.  I was greatly mistaken.  Much time is spent developing the state of the setting and establishing the main characters, rather than immediately jumping headlong into the action.  This makes for a much more satisfying picture for those who like to think, as is the case with all of Night's films (save perhaps Lady in the Water, which is questoinable).Few motion pictures capture the depths of mystery the way The Village does.  Some say that they guessed the ending long before it came, but I find that unlikely.  The clues are definitely there, as they should be, but everything has been orchestrated so perfectly it is hard to tear yourself away from the story long enough to consider the hidden truth.Night is a master at revealing the right details at the right times.  The pace can really only be thought of as slow if the viewer doesn't care to pay attention to everthing that is going on within this small village.  Love is the unsung hero of the village, whose roots run deep within the hearts of nearly every person who lives there.  The Village takes us back to a simpler time where morals were the very foundation of a community, where everyone was free to trust everyone else and happiness could be found in even the most mundane things.  Churning the butter, sweeping the porch, washing the dishes - these are joyous undertakings in which each member of the town contributes to the good of all.As for the creatures, termed ""Those we do not speak of,"" they sure do speak of them a lot!  Despite the fear the creatures evoke, it also strikes one as just a little humorous that was the term given to the mostly unseen monsters of the woods.  Despite this, The Village is very intense indeed.  It is mesmorizing to watch as the audience alternates between the goodness of the people and the fear that exists just out of sight.I cannot say enough goos things about this underrated film.  I loved every moment of it.  Perhaps the best feature is how it shifts perspectives in mid-stream, but fails to lose any of its credibility.

859906,A2OVUDBRWGX0LL,B00064LJVE,David,"[1, 1]","I'm a big fan of M. Night's, but admit to being a little disappointed by his latest effort.The movie details a circa 1880s village whose occupants are terrified of the creatures (referred to as ""those we do not speak about"") who live in the forest that surrounds the village.  Some of the villagers maintain a tense nightly vigil from their watch tower, while the others cower indoors in the hope that nothing happens.When one of the characters, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is injured, circumstances dictate that someone from the village try to traverse the forest in an attempt to get needed medicine from neighboring villages.While there are a few scary moments in the movie, particulary any of the scenes taking place in/near the forest, I found the movie wanting in creating a feeling of tension.  The village itself is a well-constructed movie setting, and the period costumes and dialogue are very well done--although some of the conversations seem a bit rambling at times.The actors do a good job and William Hurt, as the village's patriarch, is well-chosen for the role.  I did have a problem with Phoenix being given such a prominent billing considering that he spent nearly half the movie unconscious.The movie's revalation, while a twist to a few, became obvious to me a little over halfway through.  While it may have been a bit clever, it had the feel of a Twilight Zone ending (the movie could easily be condensed into a one-hour Zone episode).Overall, it's a decent flick with some scares to it.Oh, by the way, I noticed Shaymalan couldn't help but put himself in his own movie (again).

Night Shyamalan, while only slightly holding onto his knack for jolts and screams, has created a film that is a tribute to his maturation as a filmmaker.While 'The Sixth Sense' still remains a better work, both in its unexpectedness and it's simple yet amazing production, 'The Village' has its merits.As one would expect, the cinematography and direction are gripping and superb. The script, in a way that is, to say the least, not modern seems forced coming from the mouths of the modern actors. However, this may all be part of the plan, the plot. Instead of the major twist that is almost unforeseeable coming at the end of his other films, `The Village' has multiple turns in plot. First, the viewer is led to believe one thing, then another, then another. And the emanated knowledge that a twist is on its way does wonders for eliminating suspense - a great fault of film's almost too simple plot.However, Interesting camera angles and what seems to be &quot;normal&quot; editing, create a beautiful town of people. They are completely engulfed in their lives in a small meadow surrounded by a forest that they do not enter. They are na?ve, innocent, happy.The acting talent is underused and does not compare to the superb quality of the Oscar nominated cast of 'The Sixth Sense.' However, after the viewer lets go of the fact that Kirsten Dunst was originally casted to play Ivy, and that her role is unlike many seen on the silver screen, Bryce Dallas Howard shines like a true rising star. Her gentleness coupled with the role's strength of character could not be more perfect. Adrien Brody demonstrates that he is more than just a dramatic actor, even though his role is quite dramatic, while Joaquin Phoenix, without words for much of the film, demonstrates that acting is more than just memorization of scripted lines. Most of the other characters are underdeveloped in an especially disturbing form. They are part of a community, a village. Yet, the sense of community is only depicted in the most visual form. Besides a few very personal connections, the actors seemed to be distanced from their characters, and the characters from each other.The previews are necessarily deceiving. They neither ruin nor comment on the true nature of the plot. However, you should not expect something whole-heartedly jolting. This is not a horror. I jumped (three times) granted, due to the stereotypical mounting of high pitched strings paired with moments of intense action. However, the film should be looked at as a drama that truly looks into the nature of humanity.Though the film seems empty and shallow, thinking back has made me realize the multiple levels on which Shyamalan speaks.

859915,A1OIPRC7LMNN9V,B00064LJVE,Dominic,"[2, 5]","M. Night Shyamalan is an incredible director. He really has a knack creating films that will make you jump in your seat while keeping them with a PG-13 rating. This is because he doesn't rely on shocking amounts of gore to frighten his audience. He wraps a blanket of fear around viewers by combining suspense and expectation with jarring music and sound effects. And he drives his movies along with eerie story lines that are mysterious and always end with a twist.Maybe that's what's wrong with The Village. It's too formulaic, but yet at the same time, it deviates too much from the formula. In the end you don't get what you expect, you get something far worse. M. Night's films rely so much on build up that if the ending doesn't pack a powerful enough punch, the whole movie goes down the drain.In a nutshell, this film centers on a rural community in the 1890's. But this is no ordinary village. Woods surround the village, and mysterious creatures live in these woods. The villagers have always had a truce with these monsters. They don't venture into their forests, and the monsters won't venture into their village.I loved all of M. Night's previous films, and I really thought this one was going to be great, but I was deceived. I had put too much faith in M. Night. He is, after all, only human. He has a right to screw up, but he exercises this right a little too much in The Village. This movie would've made a great episode of the twilight zone, but its not good enough to be turned into a feature length film. Parts of the movie feel empty or unnecessary. But worst of all, the monsters just seem to be a side plot.I loved the concept for this film. In fact, I loved this film right up to about the middle of it, when my friend whispered to me his thoughts about what would happen. I thought about what he had told me, but dismissed everything he said. It just seemed too lame. Well, he was right, and that twist came far too soon.Maybe M. Night sensed the weakness of his writing, and decided to add another twist. That's right, there are two twists. Well, they kind of come together to create one bigger twist, but they are revealed at different times during the movie. This second twist is better, but still fairly predictable, and doesn't make the movie anymore satisfying.I loved the acting. I loved the sets. I loved the directing. I loved the concept. But the twists fall short and the movie falls apart. This movie hasn't made me lose faith in M. Night, but it has made me questioning his writing.

People were probably disappointed because the film was sold as a thriller when it's a mood piece about how fear and paranoia impact a community, a timely theme in our post 9/11 world. Instead of misrepresenting THE VILLAGE as a twisty shocker a la THE SIXTH SENSE, the marketing department should've tried another approach: ""M. Night Shyamalan as you've never seen him before!"" :-)Unlike MNS's previous films, it's easier to see through this story about the citizens of Covington Woods, an 1890s-style farm community, who won't venture beyond their village's borders because of their uneasy ""truce"" with the ""creatures"" outside, including jettisoning anything colored red, the ""bad color"" that purportedly attracts these creatures. The narrative transparency causes the dreamlike effect of MNS's usual leisurely pace to peter out too soon. Fortunately, the stellar cast, beautiful Pennsylvania scenery, and eerie atmosphere held my attention. Former co-stars William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver reunite as village elders Edward Walker and Alice Hunt; for once Hurt's slightly dazed soft-spokenness suits his character! :-) Joaquin Phoenix, re-teaming with his SIGNS director, radiates quiet strength and intensity as Lucius Hunt, who tries to cross the village borders into ""the towns"" for medicine to combat the community's recent rash of illnesses and deaths. Phoenix is well-matched by Bryce Dallas Howard, lovely and endearing in her film debut as Walker's blind daughter Ivy. I liked Ivy's subtle boldness as she saves the day after the guys who accompany her to the village borders chicken out.I wasn't surprised that our household fave Adrien Brody signed on for the role of mentally-challenged Noah Percy (or as his character has been dubbed by smart-alecks, ""the VILLAGE idiot"") as his first post-Oscar role. It gave him an opportunity to work with a hot director (turning MNS down at that point in his career would've been akin to turning down Alfred Hitchcock in the 1940s and '50s), and most actors can't resist playing handicapped characters. Brody did a fine job with a role more complex than it first seems. In Brody's able hands, overgrown child Noah simultaneously breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and creeps you out. His behavior reminded me of autistic/ADHD children I've known, so I was particularly moved when Lucius wonders if ""the towns"" might have medicines to help Noah ""sit still and learn."" (Seeing Brody in 1890s-style clothing also got me thinking how great he'd be as Ichabod Crane if somebody films ...SLEEPY HOLLOW again!) The finest moment in Brody's performance comes after Lucius and Ivy's engagement is announced. Up until this point, Lucius, Ivy, and Noah have been a trio, with Noah responding affectionately to Ivy's kindness. That changes forever after the engagement, when Noah turns up on Lucius' doorstep with grief in his heart, tears in his eyes -- and a knife in his hand. After the attack, Noah's parents find him rocking agitatedly on the porch, frightened of ""the bad color"" on his bloodstained hands. When Ivy finds out, she confronts Noah, who holds his arms out to her, clearly sorry and hoping for forgiveness, only to have Ivy start shrieking and hitting him until she's dragged off him. Although what Noah did was horribly, unforgivably wrong, his howls of anguish and wrenching sobs almost brought me to tears.When Lucius' wounds become infected, Ivy must trek to ""the towns"" to get medicine. Here's where the twist (and the *SPOILER*) comes in: Walker gives his daughter what turns out to be a prescription, and the foreshadowing (particularly various Villagers' revelations of losing loved ones violently in ""the towns"" in their pre-Village lives) pays off. Our villagers *don't* live in the 1890s. The time is now...the village is a sanctuary from today's world, created by the town elders to raise their children away from the tragedy and heartbreak of their former modern city lives... the creatures were fabricated to keep the young people in line and in the dark, with various townspeople -- including Noah in mischievous-child mode -- donning creature costumes and skinning small animals periodically to scare everybody. And Walker masterminded it all! A history teacher from a powerful family, Walker used his inherited wealth to establish this quasi-Brigadoon in an isolated area of the Walker family's game preserve, with the adults conspiring to keep the village going with various deceptions. I liked the idea that Walker's rich enough to pull this off, with the preserve personnel on board with the ruse (when the young ranger Ivy meets outside the game preserve realizes she's a Walker, he quickly agrees to help her); I'm all for the idea of living in one's own little homemade world! :-) But why the hell would supposedly intelligent modern people like Walker & Company set their new community in an ersatz 1890s (even the gravestones list 1890s dates!), a time without *antibiotics?!* The film begins at the funeral of a little boy who, it's made clear, is one of several children who died of illnesses that could've been cured with the right medicine. I can't believe Walker and the town doctor didn't take precautions to have modern meds available just in case, to say nothing of medicine/treatments that might have helped poor mentally-stunted Noah and maybe even Ivy's blindness before it was too late. It's unconscionable that, however well-meant Walker's power trip is, he and the others would let their children die or be damaged for life rather than go into ""the towns"" for help, even if it means their elaborate ruse might collapse around them! (Amish people come to cities for supplies or trade in real life, so why couldn't Walker and the villagers do the same?) THE VILLAGE would've been more compelling had the script delved deeper into that aspect of it, with the secrets, lies, and power the elders have, but at such a terrible cost. Then MNS might have had a future classic on his hands, not just the cinematic equivalent of a nice try.When THE VILLAGE was released on DVD, I rented it to double-check whether I'd missed anything that would have made sense out of the village elders' eschewing modern medicine other than simply not wanting to return to the big, bad city and risk painful memories and/or giving themselves away -- and no, there wasn't.  Indeed, now that I've seen the DVD and its extras (including interesting making-of featurettes and Bryce Dallas Howard's personal production diary), I'm more convinced than ever that The Big Twist was a last-minute decision by M. Night Shyamalan to add a surprise plot turn to THE VILLAGE to meet fans' expectations (is the twist still a surprise if viewers actually *expect* one? :-).  There were a couple of striking scenes left out of the finished film, but one didn't make sense in context and the other was redundant (too bad, because both were beautifully filmed and acted), so I can see why they ended up on the cutting room floor. Still, the film is worth watching at least once if you approach it as an ensemble drama about a paranoid community instead of as an edge-of-your-seat thriller.",3,Who Are THE VILLAGE's True

I disagree.  I think this one pushes the envelope backward a bit.  It strives not for amazing effects or expanding the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen in terms of sexuality or gore, but it strives for something that too often seems lost in hollywood today: thought.Here's the bottom line: if you want a movie that challenges your brain to do something besides keep your heart moving, watch The Village.  If you want a movie that will kill whatever brain cells you have left after a lifetime of watching nothing but MTV, watch Alien Vs Preditor.  The Village requires reflection, patience, character development, and a good discussion later on the issue of whether evil is learned or inborn.  Notice how this movie sets the world on its head -the most ""innocent"" character is the most violent, the quietest is the bravest, the blind is the most adventursome, and the parents who are supposed to protect their children are the ones who by their own choice subject them to disease and death.This is not a schmulzy shock/terror movie like ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th.""

You might say I found myself in a time capsule with regard to this particular film. Although my wife saw it when it was new--nine years ago--she urged me not to waste my time with it. She Who Must Be Obeyed, well, was obeyed!No harm seeing the thing now, and I loved it. Briefly, it is the story of a small early-19th-century community living in a certain isolation in the &#34;Covington Woods&#34;. They sound a little like Jane Austen's dialogue, definitely American but Austenesque just the same. Exactly as we might imagine they spoke back then.There is no stiffness here, no mean-spirited message and no small-mindedness either. Thus Shyamalan succeeds in establishing that deep trust the audience wants to feel for the players. That is an artful craft not easy to accomplish, and Shyamalan does it every time. Do not forget that.When the town's main elder (William Hurt) sees his blind daughter (Bryce Dallas Howard) fall in love with an eerily quite, handsome young man (Joaquin Phoenix) he is overjoyed. When a jealous nut (Adrien Brody) stabs the young man, the desperation and pain are palpable. The tension and sadness are heavy--will he live or die?And why is everybody acting so oddly? Could it be the grotesquely porcupine-quilled monsters that prowl the woods at night? Shyamalan does not hide them from us--remember that, for I will spoil nothing here except to remark that this film established Shyamalan's genius as a &#34;sleight-of-hand&#34; director. No one else ever did this except Hitchcock and Kurosawa. So, the film has a handful of flaws, and I'm guessing Shyamalan put them there deliberately.The fact that he succeeds with this PG-rated, beautiful, calm film is obvious when one sees (or remembers) the hatred spewed by some after they had seen the movie. I recall it well: Rotten. Cheap. Not scary. A waste of time. A waste of money. All I can do, having just seen it, is laugh at such mindless insults. It is one of the best films I have ever seen, simply because in the end, you will ask yourself huge, insanely huge, moral questions and propose hypotheses to yourselves.And there is no director I know who has ever accomplished that like Shyamalan does with THE VILLAGE.

859930,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B00064LJVE,elena maria vidal,"[3, 4]","Last night I was watching the M. Night Shyamalan film ""The Village"" (2004) and found it to be a mystical parable. St John of the Cross, in his poems and commentaries ""The Dark Night"" and ""The Ascent of Mt Carmel"" and even in the ""Living Flame of Love"" speaks of darkness and blindness as states in which one proves the love for the Beloved. In the film, the blind young girl is the only one able to save her beloved, wounded for love of her. The Spiritual Canticle emphasizes the ""wound of love."" ""Why, since you wounded this heart, don't you heal it?"" The soul must not fear the ""wild beasts"" while going through the ""woods and thickets"" to find healing for the Beloved, just like the girl trying to avoid the ""monsters"" in the woods.In the film, the lovers pledged themselves ""in the serene night,"" ""the tranquil night."" In ""The Village"" the maidens must ""stay away"" from the ""outskirts."" The emphasis on solitude in the poems of St John, especially in ""The Dark Night"" where it says ""in a place where no one else appeared"" was similar to the scene in the film where the young maiden realizes she must make the journey alone. Only pure love and self-sacrifice in the blindness of faith can save the one she loves.On another level, I find ""The Village"" interesting for the portrayal of flight from the world. It has long been a Christian practice to withdraw into the desert to find God and peace. However, as the Desert Fathers discovered, we can never escape the our own human nature and the wounds of original sin. In the pristine refuge of Covington Wood, people fall in love with the wrong people, there is jealousy, and even hatred. The elders must keep the youngsters in line through the terrifying story of monsters in the woods, so that even in the safety of the wilderness the children are afraid. While we are in the flesh, there is no escape and the only true refuge is the Lord.",5,A mystical journey,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,1892,"['Last', 'night', 'was', 'watching', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'Village', '2004', 'found', 'be', 'mystical', 'parable', 'St', 'John', 'Cross', 'poems', 'commentaries', 'Dark', 'Night', 'Ascent', 'Mt', 'Carmel', 'even', 'Living', 'Flame', 'Love', 'speaks', 'darkness', 'blindness', 'states', 'one', 'love', 'Beloved', 'film', 'blind', 'young', 'girl', 'only', 'one', 'able', 'save', 'beloved', 'wounded', 'love', 'Spiritual', 'Canticle', 'wound', 'love', 'Why', 'wounded', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'heal', 'soul', 'must', 'not', 'fear', 'wild', 'beasts', 'going', 'woods', 'thickets', 'find', 'healing', 'Beloved', 'just', 'girl', 'trying', 'avoid', 'monsters', 'woods.In', 'film', 'lovers', 'pledged', 'serene', 'night', 'tranquil', 'night', 'Village', 'maidens', 'must', 'stay', 'away', 'outskirts', 'emphasis', 'solitude', 'poems', 'St', 'John', 'especially', 'Dark', 'Night', 'where', 'place', 'where', 'one', 'else', 'appeared', 'was', 'similar', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'young', 'maiden', 'must', 'make', 'journey', 'alone', 'Only', 'pure', 'love', 'self-sacrifice', 'blindness', 'faith', 'can', 'save', 'one', 'level', 'find', 'Village', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'flight', 'world', 'long', 'been', 'Christian', 'practice', 'withdraw', 'desert', 'find', 'God', 'peace', 'However', 'Desert', 'Fathers', 'discovered', 'can', 'never', 'escape', 'own', 'human', 'nature', 'wounds', 'original', 'sin', 'pristine', 'refuge', 'Covington', 'Wood', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'wrong', 'people', 'jealousy', 'even', 'hatred', 'elders', 'must', 'keep', 'youngsters', 'line', 'terrifying', 'story', 'monsters', 'woods', 'even', 'safety', 'wilderness', 'children', 'are', 'afraid', 'are', 'flesh', 'escape', 'only', 'true', 'refuge', 'Lord']",N/A

But I'm not one of those &#34;let me pick apart this movie and whine and complain about it&#34; types. No, i'm one of those &#34;this is a horror movie so let me kick back and enjoy it&#34; types. I find horror movies fun to watch and a great escape from the real world.With that said, i am very sad to say that this had to be one of the worse movies i have ever seen and M. Night Shyamalan has got to be one of the worse directors ever. Everyone says that he does his movies in a different fashion and that he is soo creative. I honestly think he just doesn't know what he is doing. His movies just don't seem to flow very well and they all seem to drop off at the ending. You need a good ending to have a good movie. Plain and simple.Sixth Sense: it turns out Bruce Willis was dead the whole time.  Ohhh, who cares. It was so predictable. Like he could live with his wife for 1 year and not notice she would never talk or acknowledge him. Horrible!Unbreakable: I wouldn't even consider this an ending. The whole movie was leading up to it and then ____________&#60;--nothing. Big big big let down.Signs: not even going to get into this one.And finally this movie. My opinion of this movie might have been different if the ending wasn't so stupid. You can't make a movie, set back in the day, about a secluded village where in the woods there is a &#34;monster&#34; and then find out that they are actually living in modern times and there is really no monster. It just tore the whole movie down. Everything he was building up was torn down. The whole movie was a lie. That's not a creative ending. That's an ending from someone who saw &#34;The Truman Show&#34; one to many times and said &#34;oh, oh, me too, me too!&#34;I really hate to say this about a movie, but by all means stay clear of this movie, and all of his movies for that matter.

859934,A1SW80RQNB3DMK,B00064LJVE,EquesNiger,"[6, 7]","People always try to evaluate Shyamalan films on the inevitable and anxiously awaited ""twist"" he has become so infamous for. In a sense, he's a director that has been typecast. Now, being someone who figured out ""The Sixth Sense"" from the teaser previews, and hence already knowing what the twist was to be in what is regarded as his best and most surprising flick, I've instead focused a lot more on the message. All of his films have them, from the almost inane ""for every good, there is a corresponding evil"" in ""Unbreakable"", to the more profound message of faith in ""Signs"".One of this movie's twists is evident from the beginning. Elder Walker (William Hurt) is the founder and leader of a society of folks who have retreated from the violence of the modern world, and taken refuge in an agrarian paradise. However, all paths to paradise have a sacrifice, and the sacrifice in this particular one is the complete lack of modern medicine, a technology of the outside world. Having sworn never to go back, the Village Elders find themselves in a quandary when Lucius Hunt (Pheonix) is wounded in a brutal attack by Noah Percy (Brody), a savage but essentially retarded village boy, who shares Hunt's infatuation for Walker's blind but ever-so-aware daughter Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard - watch for more excellent work from this extremely talented actress). As Lucius and Ivy are regarded by the Elders as bedrock on which the future of the Village rests, particularly after the Elders pass away, a tough decision is made to send Ivy, with two male guardians (hardy Village boys), to the edge of the forest to seek the arcane and forbidden medicine to heal Lucius.As a backdrop for the story, the forest surrounding the Village is the inviolate territory of ""those we don't speak of"", terrible monsters who wreak horrible retribution on any who enter. At the same time, small animals are turning up mutilated in the Village. Assumed to be the work of the monsters in the woods, this violent incursion into the Village by those who have essentially besieged it creates an ominous sense of foreboding and impending doom.Some people went to see ""The Village"" expecting a horror film of sorts. The film is almost entirely a psychological drama, and the tension is purely psychological throughout. Perhaps its most profound point is when Ivy, on her way back with medicine, comes face to face with one of ""those we don't speak of"", supposedly impossible at this point in the film, and learns that even paradise breeds its own monsters.It's a good film. It's even better if you watch it with your mind open, and not expecting to have a temporary lobotomy for 2 hours as in so many other films with no message, but a lot of eye popping effects. Any film that one either loves passionately or hates vociferously has to be one you should see ;-)",5,One of my favorite Shyamalan films to date,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,2836,"['People', 'always', 'try', 'evaluate', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'inevitable', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'twist', 'become', 'so', 'infamous', 'sense', 'director', 'been', 'typecast', 'Now', 'being', 'someone', 'who', 'figured', 'out', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'teaser', 'previews', 'hence', 'already', 'knowing', 'what', 'twist', 'was', 'be', 'what', 'regarded', 'best', 'most', 'surprising', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'instead', 'focused', 'lot', 'more', 'message', 'films', 'have', 'almost', 'inane', 'good', 'corresponding', 'evil', 'Unbreakable', 'more', 'profound', 'message', 'faith', 'Signs', '.One', 'movie', 'twists', 'evident', 'beginning', 'Elder', 'Walker', 'William', 'Hurt', 'founder', 'leader', 'society', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'retreated', 'violence', 'modern', 'world', 'taken', 'refuge', 'agrarian', 'paradise', 'However', 'paths', 'paradise', 'have', 'sacrifice', 'sacrifice', 'particular', 'one', 'complete', 'lack', 'modern', 'medicine', 'technology', 'outside', 'world', 'Having', 'sworn', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'Village', 'Elders', 'find', 'quandary', 'when', 'Lucius', 'Hunt', 'Pheonix', 'wounded', 'brutal', 'attack', 'Noah', 'Percy', 'Brody', 'savage', 'essentially', 'retarded', 'village', 'boy', 'who', 'shares', 'Hunt', 'infatuation', 'Walker', 'blind', 'ever-so-aware', 'daughter', 'Ivy', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'watch', 'more', 'excellent', 'work', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actress', 'Lucius', 'Ivy', 'are', 'regarded', 'Elders', 'bedrock', 'future', 'Village', 'rests', 'particularly', 'Elders', 'pass', 'away', 'tough', 'decision', 'made', 'send', 'Ivy', 'two', 'male', 'guardians', 'hardy', 'Village', 'boys', 'edge', 'forest', 'seek', 'arcane', 'forbidden', 'medicine', 'heal', 'Lucius.As', 'backdrop', 'story', 'forest', 'surrounding', 'Village', 'inviolate', 'territory', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'terrible', 'monsters', 'who', 'wreak', 'horrible', 'retribution', 'who', 'enter', 'same', 'time', 'small', 'animals', 'are', 'turning', 'up', 'mutilated', 'Village', 'Assumed', 'be', 'work', 'monsters', 'woods', 'violent', 'incursion', 'Village', 'who', 'have', 'essentially', 'besieged', 'ominous', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'impending', 'doom.Some', 'people', 'went', 'see', 'Village', 'expecting', 'horror', 'film', 'sorts', 'film', 'almost', 'entirely', 'psychological', 'drama', 'tension', 'purely', 'psychological', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'profound', 'point', 'when', 'Ivy', 'way', 'back', 'medicine', 'face', 'face', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'supposedly', 'impossible', 'point', 'film', 'even', 'paradise', 'own', 'monsters.It', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'watch', 'mind', 'open', 'not', 'expecting', 'have', 'temporary', 'lobotomy', '2', 'hours', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'message', 'lot', 'eye', 'popping', 'effects', 'film', 'one', 'passionately', 'vociferously', 'be', 'one', 'should', 'see']",N/A
859935,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00064LJVE,Erica Anderson,"[6, 11]","I had meant to see ""The Village"" over this past summer but it was one of the few films that I just didn't get the time and energy to seeing. There were other films that I simply felt were far more compelling. I was right. I recently screened the widescreen dvd version of ""The Village"" and I have to say that I'm glad that I did not pay my hard earned money to the film.The premise of the film is on a farm community in Pennsylvania in the 19th century. Almost amish-like except that there are large, dangerous entities in the woods that no one want to cross paths. The community and these creatures have an understanding that each party stays within their boundaries.The cast consists some of the best method actors in Hollywood from the past couple of decades including William Hurt as Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Alice Hunt, and Adrian Brody as the intectually-challenged Noah. This film is also the debut of Ron Howard's daughter Bryce as the heroine Ivy Walker, the younger daughter of Edward Walker. Her love intest is Luctius Hunt played by Joaqin Phoenix. Everyone in the cast except for Joaqin put in convincing performances. I felt that Joaqin's acting in this film was rather stiff and lifeless.The film starts off on the right foot. The suspense of the idea that there were monsters in the woods was convincing. The combination of the cinematography and film score was what really made the film suspenseful and intense as it was. Unfortunately the film begins a slow descent into cinematic purgatory every time I saw Joaqin in the scene. Bryce on the other hand was a real delight as the independent Ivy. Despite being blind, Ivy was not your weak, damsel in distress. She knew how to take care of herself and did not rely on those around her.What I did like in the film was that the scenes with the creatures from the woods were very limited. Not showing them a whole lot in the beginning of the film was a great strategy by M. Night Shymalan. I have to admit that this film did get my blood pumping and gave me goosebumps with the idea that the creatures wanted to kill the villagers. M. Night Shymalan definitely has a knack for cinematography. I also loved the film score which gave the film an eery atmosphere. I don't think it would have been as suspenseful without the music.What I didn't like about the film is: A) Joaqin Phoenix's horrible acting skills. His late brother River Phoenix was a great actor. Joaqin is not. Major miscast. B) The slow pace of the film. There were moments of the film when I thought it was simply about an 19th century farming community. C) The second half of the film. That was just a lame idea. I didn't like the idea of that humans are their own worst enemy concept. That was really pretentious and totally ruined the film for me.The bonus dvd features were far more interesting than most of this film. I loved watching how the film was literally constructed. It's too bad the film itself was a big pretentious mess but then again I always felt that M. Night's films were big, pretentious, overrated cinematic POS.I don't necessarily hate this film as much as a lot of critics and movie fans.

Apparently, William Hurt's character fools everyone by putting on the ""creature"" costume to prevent the villagers from leaving the village.

859938,A97Q71MM5N4NW,B00064LJVE,"Everett ""Future Raptured""","[4, 7]","I must say I was expecting more than I got during the movie. You will be fooled completely during this movie. Not because of the plot of the story, but what because the story is really about. The twist was not too original, and the ending is sort of given away near the middle, but it makes a lot of sense, and some people really do live this way. I'm not giving it away for anyone who's seen it but if you haven't yet, stop reading now.The Village takes place in the seemingly normal township of Covington in the year of 1897. It's a seemingly normal place with a population of merely 60 people. As the simple life of these innocent persons continues, through the cracks of this perfect and blessed comes something no one ever expected to be there in the first place.Strange, and evil creatures who infestate the woods around Covington have kept a truce with the townspeople for many years. The residents of Covington won't go into the woods, and the creatures won't go into the valley. But when Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) determined to show the village there is nothing to fear of these creatures, breaches the border of the woods. Now the race against time is on to stop to escape the village before all hell brakes loose.This is exactly what M. Night Shyamalan sets you up for and it turns from a horror/thriller, to a romance filled with physical and mental obstacles. I'm sorry to say that even though I enjoyed the film deeply, it was not what we were put up to believe it was about. I came out of the theatre thinking to myself, ""My God, what was I thinking, I want my five months back"" but then I came to realize it does have it's moments, and in it's own way is very entertaining when you look at it one way instead of the other.The acting, I must say, was not all it should've been. Even with nation wide actors such as William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brenden Gleeson, and Joaquin Phoenix, the village brings in people who are too used to be being in the modern times, and don't make it too believable that they are in fact in 1897. Joaquin Phoenix who is used to acting in action related movies completely flops over in this dramatic style for Shyamalan, and same goes for Sigourney Weaver. It seems like a good movie, but there's just something that makes it fall short of being so.There are, in fact, two things that saved this movie entirely. One, first timer Bryce Dallas Howard who is in fact the daughter of Ron Howard. As a first time roll, she's the only one that made you think otherwise about the movie. Her roll itself was played so genuinly and so perfect that it keeps you within the movie and not about what's going to happen, or about the average acting. Adrien Brody was also very good but not nearly as good as Bryce. After all, how much more better can you get than this on a first time roll?The second thing that really saved the Village was the amazing music. With renowned violinist Hilary Hahn, the music captures the movie more than any other I've heard. I think the soundtracks may be getting better to movies as they go along. M. Night Shyamalan did a good choice for going through with James Newton Howard to score because the violins with the fast motioness feeling to the fast parts bring in a more subtle feeling. Yet, for the suspenseful part, it brings in a low uneasy feeling to the movie. There is a certain scene many can relate when the creatures are attacking, and Lucius grabs Ivy's hand and the two rush into the basement. This is my all time favorite moment when Hilary Hahn plays the violin at its best, and it gets gorgeous. Even though it's supposed to be an intense moment, you can't help but be humbled by the beautiful music.The special features on the DVD aren't limited, and come with some pretty unsuspecting things that really catch your attention, and sometimes take your surprise and make you laugh. And the movie itself did in fact have some laughs, and for you might expect from review, it is good at times and brings in something unexpecting and surprising to it, and if it weren't for those creatures I waited five months to see, I would've never have gotten it.The only thing that would've made this movie a five star everything is that if Shyamalan wouldn't be such a one trick pony. His movies are awesome, and they build you up to expectations that were usually met with Signs and The Sixth Sense, but not with the Village. I think he wanted to go into a little more slower pace than his last movies, but when you have something that's amazing, don't change it into something else. The audience always feels they're in need of finding what they've waited for, not finding something completely different. I've found the trailer terrifying, and that's pretty much it. All in all, it's a good movie, and passed all through the flaws, it's worth 4 stars for originality. I hope Bryce Dallas Howard comes back in more movies. She was the only one that made the movie worth while. I'll keep watching M. Night Shyamalan, I just hope he can come up with more like Signs.",5,"It different, that's for sure",1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,5036,"['must', 'say', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'got', 'movie',

This time I will.'The Village' was surrounded by an air of negative press since long before it was actually released.  Why or how this was I'm not entirely certain, but it was definitely there, and it eventually got the weakest reviews of the four major release M. Night Shyamalan movies.  Now, I can understand why people wouldn't like this as much as his previous 3 films, I probably like it the least of the 4, but why anyone who liked the others would dislike this one is beyond me.  It's the exact same formula. And yeah, the film was definitely mis-marketed, making it seem like a lot more of a horror movie than it actually was.  And yeah, the ending ain't so hot.  As others have said, it's neither shocking nor satisfying, but there's a helluva lot of movie before the ending.  It's beautifully shot, with gorgeous natural scenery, and some relatively original, intriguing looking creatures.  What's more, the characters are genuinely likable, particularly the leads Phoenix and Howard, something relatively rare and difficult in a period piece. Yeah, the movies slow, but so were all his others, and this fact is really beside the point.  Shyamalan's movies were always as much about the visuals and atmosphere as they were about the plot- the less eventful scenes are as much what the movie is about as anything.  And I suppose that's what it all comes down to.  If you were never much into the atmosphere of Shyamalan's work, you're probably not gonna like this.  If you were into it, check it out.Finally, I'm gonna discuss the supposedly derivative nature of the finale.  This isn't really relevant to how much I enjoy the film, but I wanna discuss it, and it will have spoilers:  Lotsa people have claimed that the ending is stolen from this or that or whatever.  Maybe it is, but the sorta insistence that some people display is ridiculous.  The ending just isn't original or clever enough for you to need to insist that it was specifically lifted from anywhere.  Hell, look at the Amish.  All you have to  think is, 'Hmm, what if those people who live so different from the rest of us simply pretended like, or didn't know that we existed.'  It's nothing groundbreaking.  Hell, the ending occurred to me about 10 minutes into the film.  The thing is, this thought wasn't even based on anything I saw in the film, and I even missed pretty much all the clues shown thereafter.  It's just a natural, fairly obvious twist.

859943,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00064LJVE,Get What We Give,"[4, 7]","The Village was one of those films that I was busting to see when it hit theaters. However, one thing or another got in the way. So I managed to secure it for the first day of its DVD release. Was I disappointed!The majority of the film is a very spooky set up that has some of the elements of the very creepy British horror film, ""Blood on Satan's Claw"". Unfortunately, Shyamalan is now known for his Barnum-esque cheap tricks, so you can't fully buy in to what is presented.The premise is that this remote village set sometime in the early 1800's or late 1700's is beseiged by creepy creatures who live in the woods. They provide offerings to the creatures to keep them at bay. The creatures are truly creepy, but never moreso than when seen as they quickly glide across the corner of the screen.In the midst of this is a little love story going on between Dallas Howard (little Ronnie ""Opie Taylor"" Howard's daughter) and Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix is amazingly good and still surprises me that he is as good, if not better than anything his now deceased brother was doing. Dallas Howard is also something of a great find. John Hurt and Cherry Jones (a Shyamalan regular) are also quite good.The problem comes in the guise of the director himself and the audience's expectations.You see, we've all seen the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. We know that we are being set up for some sort of a weird twist in the final reel. It's Shyamalan's formula. It's also typical for the old Twilight Zone show and any number of cheap thrillers. Sixth Sense was a really effective movie, because no director/writer had gone down that path in quite a while. But if you keep delivering the same formula (as Shy has done), then there's no surprise and nothing new. It becomes formulaic. Think about when the movie ""Scream"" first came out. It was considered brilliant for delivering a good thriller, but also for poking fun at horror movies, sequels, itself and society in general. Then it became the butt of its own jokes and the genre imploded. Shyamalan created his own thriller genre which was not necessary. It may get a few warm bodies in the seats, but as is evidenced by his boxoffice, it can't maintain the momentum that the first film achieved.Since it's Shyamalan, you start looking for where the McGuffin is. For me it was the variety of hat styles worn by the men that tipped me off that we were either on a different planet or that what time period we were supposed to be seeing wasn't really what we were seeing.Anyway, it's a decent enough film for relatively mindless viewing, but don't expect it to be a water cooler type of film.",2,Spooky first half and hokey ending reveal blah delivery,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,2635,"['Village', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'was', 'busting', 'see', 'when', 'hit', 'theaters', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'way', 'managed', 'secure', 'first', 'day', 'DVD', 'release', 'Was', 'disappointed', 'majority', 'film', 'very', 'spooky', 'set', 'up', 'elements', 'very', 'creepy', 'British', 'horror', 'film', 'Blood', 'Satan', 'Claw', 'Unfortunately', 'Shyamalan', 'now', 'known', 'Barnum-esque', 'cheap', 'tricks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fully', 'buy', 'what', 'presented.The', 'premise', 'remote', 'village', 'set', 'sometime', 'early', '1800', 'late', '1700', 'beseiged', 'creepy', 'creatures', 'who', 'live', 'woods', 'provide', 'offerings', 'creatures', 'keep', 'bay', 'creatures', 'are', 'truly', 'creepy', 'never', 'moreso', 'when', 'seen', 'quickly', 'glide', 'corner', 'screen.In', 'midst', 'little', 'love', 'story', 'going', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'little', 'Ronnie', 'Opie', 'Taylor', 'Howard', 'daughter', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix.Phoenix', 'amazingly', 'good', 'still', 'surprises', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'anything', 'now', 'deceased', 'brother', 'was', 'doing', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'also', 'something', 'great', 'find', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'Shyamalan', 'regular', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good.The', 'problem', 'guise', 'director', 'audience', 'expectations.You', 'see', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'Signs', 'know', 'are', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'sort', 'weird', 'twist', 'final', 'reel', 'Shyamalan', 'formula', 'also', 'typical', 'old', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'show', 'number', 'cheap', 'thrillers', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'really', 'effective', 'movie', 'director/writer', 'had', 'gone', 'down', 'path', 'quite', 'while', 'keep', 'delivering', 'same', 'formula', 'Shy', 'done', 'then', 'surprise', 'nothing', 'new', 'formulaic', 'Think', 'when', 'movie', 'Scream', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'considered', 'brilliant', 'delivering', 'good', 'thriller', 'also', 'poking', 'fun', 'horror', 'movies', 'sequels', 'society', 'general', 'Then', 'became', 'butt', 'own', 'jokes', 'genre', 'imploded', 'Shyamalan', 'created', 'own', 'thriller', 'genre', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'may', 'get', 'few', 'warm', 'bodies', 'seats', 'evidenced', 'boxoffice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'momentum', 'first', 'film', 'achieved.Since', 'Shyamalan', 'start', 'looking', 'where', 'McGuffin', 'was', 'variety', 'hat', 'styles', 'worn', 'men', 'tipped', 'off', 'were', 'either', 'different', 'planet', 'what', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'seeing', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'were', 'seeing.Anyway', 'decent', 'enough', 'film', 'relatively', 'mindless', 'viewing', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'water', 'cooler', 'type', 'film']",N/A

In hindsight, I know the time would have been better spent sleeping, but I kept hoping that the movie would get better and actually have at least a couple of unpredictable twists, so I stuck it out. Although the acting was passable, I found the movie itself absolutely impossible. It's slow, predictable, and incredibly boring. I might have liked it a bit better if it had been advertised as a drama rather than a horror flick, because at least I wouldn't have been expecting anything scary to happen. But, on second thought, that wouldn't have worked because drama would need to be at least somewhat believable, and it wasn't that either.I don't know how Shyamalan is going to come back from this one. He seems to be regressing. Sixth Sense was brilliant, Unbreakable was worth watching, Signs couldn't be saved even by Mel Gibson but was at least tolerable, unlike The Village. I'm now glad my DVD club doesn't carry this movie because, if it did, I would have made the mistake of buying it before seeing it.

Night Shyamalan is consistent in his apparent mission to encourage his audience to look beyond the obvious to discover aberrant alternatives to the explanation of nature, including humans and their motivations.  THE VILLAGE is a very good movie if taken as another chapter in Shyamalan's odyssey.  If it doesn't have the shock jolt that his early successful film THE SIXTH SENSE had, then perhaps it is more because we as audience are beginning to understand his take on reality versus the unknown.The village of the title suggests a cult community of people dressed in 19th century garb, living off the land, abhorring money and its evil influence on mankind, and maintaining a status of coexistence with Those We Do Not Speak Of whose domain is the woods surrounding the plot of land designated for the villiage. We learn that each of the villagers has a personal dark secret that defines the reason for the establishment of the commune away from the 'world'.  There is an Amish flavor in dress and speech and government that makes this strange place appealing.  The villagers have all taken an oath not to cross the line into the woods to go to the 'towns' beyond.  It is this schism that is challenged in the story and the results of the individual will to risk because of the all-important concept of Love that is the journey through which Shyamalan guides us.The cast includes Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter in a fine first performance as the blind heroine), Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Cherry Jones, Michael Pitt and Adrien Brody and they do well with the rather stiff script they are given (the odd 19th century versus 21st century method of speaking is but one of the clues to Shyamalan's secret ending).  The photography is lovely, moody, and atmospheric and the haunting solo violin playing by Hilary Hahn of the score by James Newton Howard contribute elegantly to enhancing the mood of the film.No, this is not a great movie, but taken for what it is - another step toward the mystery of the universe conundrum - it succeeds well, at least to this viewer.

When the monsters attack, they leave behind mutilated animals and odd symbols. When a tragedy causes one of the central characters to linger near death, Ivy (who is blind) decides to risk traveling through the forest to ""the towns"" that lay beyond to try and get medicine.As usual, there is a ""big twist"" ending but this time, unlike in his other movies, I was able to figure it out beforehand though I had to wait for Shyamalan to tell me WHY the village was as it is. I think the people hammering on the dialogue are being a bit harsh...it's not Shakespearean but it's nothing that will land it on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" either.I'll agree with others that the film bombed in part because it was BADLY mis-marketed. It was advertised as though it were at the very least some sort of ""Blair Witch"" film, but it's more suspense than horror/slasher. If you're expecting blood, gore or ""stalking"" scenes, that's really not what this is..it's more of a ""moody"" atmosphere piece.BOTTOM LINE:This will NOT ""wow"" you like ""Sixth Sense"" did. You'll probably figure it out. But figuring out HOW the twist happens is tricky and still delivers some interest.

859954,A34VDLAA3IM3JC,B00064LJVE,Gretchen Wieners,"[3, 7]","This time when I went with my best friends to see a movie, my friend Karen was so totally NOT the only one who didn't understand the movie. For some reason a group of people have built themselves a village in the middle of a wildlife preserve, where they all live pretty much like people back around the time of the first Thanksgiving. But it is so clearly in the time of the modern world. For we DO see towns with present day cars, and a wildlife officer patrols the preserve in a modern Jeep or similar vehicle. The people of the village fear some sort of attacks from some fierce creatures that inhabit the woods around them. Are these attackers beasts of the wildlife preserve? Who knows? Or are they some fierce humans? No theory totally makes sense. The villagers do some vague talk about ""the ones we don't speak of"". But they so totally use that phrase often to speak of the ones they ""don't speak of""! Do these fierce attackers really exist? You can so totally sit through the whole movie eerily wondering that but so totally never get any answers! Anyhow, there does come a time when the village's idyllic way of life is indeed disrupted in a totally bloody way. But it isn't by any fierce and mysterious outside invaders. It is when one member of the village just up and stabs another almost to death for totally no reason. The victim is badly wounded, and they decide that his only hope for recovery is getting medicine from ""the towns"" that they so vaguely speak of. At least they don't call then ""the towns we don't speak of"". And if you thought this movie couldn't get any more weird, that is just when it gets so totally weirder! Who do they decide must travel to ""the towns"" to get medicines? Well, they send the fiancee of the stabbed man. At least she is one who cares about him very much. But guess what? She's blind! Yes, And THAT's whom they decide they must send ALONE through the supposedly monster-infested woods to ""the towns"" to get medicines. So she embarks on the mission, seeming to so totally have no chance of success. At one point as she seems to wander aimlessly through these woods where no other villagers dare to tread, the ground before her, as if it were glacial ice, opens up into a deep crevasse. And she so totally falls straight into the crevasse. But as if miraculously, she manages to climb out. Braving these and other dangers, she DOES get the medicine and returns to the village. How does she do it? Who knows? It is one of the so many unsolved mysteries of this movie. Like my friend Karen, this movie's heroine must have a fifth sense. That's all I can say. So she returns and there's a happy ending? Right? Who knows? This movie is just so totally unpredictable, but NOT in a good way! Just as she gets back to her fiancee, the movie abruptly ends, leaving everything as mysterious as ever. Now I'm afraid my friend Karen will think we're just being mean to not explain this movie to her. But we're her friends. We work hard at keeping her from putting her foot in her mouth (or her fist either). We protect her from lots of things and TRY to explain everything she doesn't understand?

Overall, it has the same pensive grandeur as the movie set in Amish country, Witness, with a kind of brooding suspense that Shamalayan is so good at.The thing about a last-minute trick though is that it should make you rethink everything you've seen before; see it all in a new light.  well it does:  but then it doesn't make sense.The only reason I didn't see the trick coming is because of a deliberate fake-out very early on.  I will admit that the story of these people stuck with me, especially once I knew the ending, but I wanted it to make more sense.  I can't really say more without spoiling it...I will say that though Bryce Dallas Howard is wonderful, a long scene of her alone in the forest seemed to go on forever.

There are some great scenes in the film that made me want to capture it for a while.I was quite moved by the scene on the porche. Now that was an excellent scene. I felt to myself ""Hell wait a minute...isnt this supposed to be a Horror Flick?"" There's some great emotion that wilfully shows on screen. The elders in the movie and how they were portrayed was as per quite ""unworldly"" owing to the fact it requires complete abandonment of the normal social norms that exist.I felt I was lost somewhere in the middle of the movie. I mean the total  plot seemed kind of confusing to me. The haunting violins that add to the super stunning visuals only left me more guessing than I thought I would be.

I saw the movie as the ultimate prank played my M. Night Shaymalan on his fans. He kept this film so secret that the public had to assume what the story was about from watching the previews. Im sure that everyone thought the movie was a big horror film about Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) venturing into the woods inhabited by monsterous creatures in the 1800s. Well, we the public could not have been more wrong. The movie is actually about a blind girl, Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) venturing into he woods to get medicines to save her fiance, Lucius Hunt, from dying. This movie had its frightening moments, but it was more a love story than a horror film. I'll admit I was disapointed at first because the movie was not what I expected, but I watched it again and realized that it was still a wonderful movie. The only thing that drove me nuts was the ending. It was a cliff hanger! I was impressed by Bryce Dallas Howard's performance. I think she has some really great films ahead of her. Joaquin Phoenix was incredible, as always, even though he did not have that many scenes. The one performance that really caught my attention was Adrien Brody as Noah Percy, the village idiot. He had an absolutely incredible performance. I think he is the only actor that could have pulled off that character that well. I really think he made the movie.

859961,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B00064LJVE,H. Jin,"[0, 1]","'The Village' is the exact point where M. Night Shyamalan started losing his mojo. By this point, 'The Sixth Sense' had become a bit of a millstone around his neck, and Shyamalan clearly felt pressured to deliver the ""twist ending"" yet again. But unlike his previous three films, his trademark twists and turns are badly bungled, and they end up ruining a film that would have been much better off without them. The film actually relies on a succession of ""revelations"", but once the first one is known, you can pretty much guess what the others will be. So the entire second half of the movie (including the Really Big Revelation) is simply confirmation of what you already half-expected, making it a big let-down.It's a shame really, because the basics of the film are pretty good. The main cast, especially Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind heroine Ivy and Adrien Brody as the disturbed (and disturbing) Noah, are good in their roles (although William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are a bit wasted). And Shyamalan does a reasonable job of setting the period and mood, giving the first act a brooding, slightly Gothic quality. The film actually would have worked much better had it simply continued as a straight period piece, as concept of the creatures attacking an isolated village is a great premise for Gothic horror. There was simply no need to throw all these (fairly predictable) curveballs at the audience, and to turn the film into something completely different.Unfortunately, it seems Shyamalan was stuck in a rut by this stage, and could only fall back on the same old tried-and-true ""twists"" he's done before. The interesting setup, and some of the performances, keeps this from being a total disaster, but it's fair to say that `The Village' is one of his weakest.",3,"Interesting setup is ruined by bungled ""twists""",1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,1777,"[""'The"", 'Village', 'exact', 'point', 'where', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'started', 'losing', 'mojo', 'point', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'had', 'become', 'bit', 'millstone', 'neck', 'Shyamalan', 'clearly', 'felt', 'pressured', 'deliver', 'twist', 'ending', 'yet', 'again', 'previous', 'three', 'films', 'trademark', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'badly', 'bungled', 'end', 'up', 'ruining', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'film', 'actually', 'succession', 'revelations', 'once', 'first', 'one', 'known', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'what', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'including', 'Really', 'Big', 'Revelation', 'simply', 'confirmation', 'what', 'already', 'half-expected', 'making', 'big', 'let-down.It', 'shame', 'really', 'basics', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'main', 'cast', 'especially', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'blind', 'heroine', 'Ivy', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'disturbed', 'disturbing', 'Noah', 'are', 'good', 'roles', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'are', 'bit', 'wasted', 'Shyamalan', 'reasonable', 'job', 'setting', 'period', 'mood', 'giving', 'first', 'act', 'brooding', 'slightly', 'Gothic', 'quality', 'film', 'actually', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'simply', 'continued', 'straight', 'period', 'piece', 'concept', 'creatures', 'attacking', 'isolated', 'village', 'great', 'premise', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'was', 'simply', 'need', 'throw', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'curveballs', 'audience', 'turn', 'film', 'something', 'completely', 'different.Unfortunately', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'stuck', 'rut', 'stage', 'could', 'only', 'fall', 'back', 'same', 'old', 'tried-and-true', 'twists', 'done', 'before', 'interesting', 'setup', 'performances', 'being', 'total', 'disaster', 'fair', 'say', 'Village', 'one', 'weakest']",N/A

859963,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B00064LJVE,Ian,"[7, 10]","NOTE:  This review is completly spoiler free.  It reveals nothing about the movie that is critical to the plot, but does reveal moments (that are not described) at specific points in the movie.  The ending is not revealed in this review.I feel sorry for M. Night Shyamalan.  He's now known as the guy who always has a breathtaking suprise ending in every movie he does, and each ending has to be better then the last.  That tremendous wieght must have been wieghing down on him the entire time he made this movie.The Village's plot can best be described as ""The amish meet ""Aliens"" "".  A quiet town from the 1800's is surrounded by nasty creatures ""those we do not speak of"".  A truce has been in place for years, where both sides do not intrude upon the other.  But lately, things have been happening, and the truce begins to unwind...Sounds like a great plot right?  It is, and it has the possibility to be so great.  A village in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by hostile creatures, and now the villages inhabitants have to figure out what to do to survive.  Yet despite a strong start and buildup, the whole movie comes crashing down in the third act, but more on that later.I think the main problems with this movie lie within its charachters and the ending.  When first watching the movie, I really didint care for any of the charachters.  It was a little hard to tell them apart, and we got little personality out of each.  The great actress Sigourney Weaver is completly wasted in this movie, getting almost no screen time whatsoever.  Late in the movie I was secretly hoping for a scene where she would save the villiage by riding out on a powerloader made out of wood, going up to the creatures threatening Ivy and saying ""Get away from her you B****!""  It would be very entertaining yes, but sadly dosent happen.The central charachter, a blind teenager named Ivy, is not very interesting to me.  She's not annoying, but she has a lukewarm personality.  I never felt that she realy loved her future husband, which is crucial to the plot.  What's really strange is that her blindness appears to be random.  She needs a cane to see where she's going most of the time, but at other moments she runs at top speed through a field, into a bushy area and onto a rock.  The most ridiculous moment is when she looks at someone coming up to her and says ""Oh, it's you.""  Uh, what?  Isint she supposed to be blind?Aside from below-average charachters, the Village is luckster in terms of scares.  There is nothing really creepy or scary about the movie.  I will admit there are a few frightenig moments involving the creatures from the woods, but thats it.  Speaking of the creatures, the is one thing that Shyamalan does get right is creepy monster designs.  When you see these beasts, they do have a great design thats memorable and creepy.Probably the worst thing about the Village is it's third act.  Everything about the story goes completly downhill after a few scenes, ruining everything that comes before it.  A monumental mistake Shyamalan makes is revealing the secret behind the creatures from the woods a full thiry minutes before the film ends!  That is simply inexcusable!  As a result of this horrendus mistake, the last scenes with the creatures were silly, as I knew the secret behind them (and no, i'm not going to tell you what it is).And the ending, which is Shyamalan's trademark, is simply sad.  Although it was a small suprise when I began to see it, the rest of it was a sad, sad joke.  After the last scene was over, and the credits began to roll, the first thing I said was ""uh...what?""  The ending did make sense and was not confusing, but it was a bad ending that could have been so much more.  Chud.com's DVD review has a suggestion as to how it could have played out, and sadly the version they suggest would have been much better.  Bottom line:  The ending is dissapointing and easily the weakest ending in all of Shyamalan's movies.I so wish I could say what could have been done to make this a great movie, but I cannot withought spoiling the plot and the ending.  So you'll have to see it and come to your own conclusion.  But it's sad how the setting and the creatures are fantastic, yet the charachters and the plot are dull.  How sad.",2,So much lost opportunity...,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,4273,"['NOTE', 'review', 'completly', 'spoiler', 'free', 'nothing', 'movie', 'critical', 'plot', 'reveal', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'described', 'specific', 'points', 'movie', 'ending', 'not', 'revealed', 'review.I', 'feel', 'sorry', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'now', 'known', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'breathtaking', 'suprise', 'ending', 'movie', 'ending', 'be', 'better', 'then', 'last', 'tremendous', 'wieght', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'wieghing', 'down', 'entire', 'time', 'made', 'movie.The', 'Village', 'plot', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'amish', 'meet', 'Aliens', 'quiet', 'town', '1800', 'surrounded', 'nasty', 'creatures', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'truce', 'been', 'place', 'years', 'where', 'sides', 'do', 'not', 'intrude', 'other', 'lately', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'happening', 'truce', 'unwind', 'great', 'plot', 'right', 'possibility', 'be', 'so', 'great', 'village', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'surrounded', 'hostile', 'creatures', 'now', 'villages', 'inhabitants', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'survive', 'strong', 'start', 'buildup', 'whole', 'movie', 'crashing', 'down', 'third', 'act', 'more', 'later.I', 'think', 'main', 'problems', 'movie', 'lie', 'charachters', 'ending', 'When', 'first', 'watching', 'movie', 'really', 'didint', 'care', 'charachters', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'tell', 'apart', 'got', 'little', 'personality', 'great', 'actress', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'completly', 'wasted', 'movie', 'getting', 'almost', 'screen', 'time', 'whatsoever', 'Late', 'movie', 'was', 'secretly', 'hoping', 'scene', 'where', 'would', 'save', 'villiage', 'riding', 'out', 'powerloader', 'made', 'wood', 'going', 'up', 'creatures', 'threatening', 'Ivy', 'saying', 'Get', 'away', 'B****', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'yes', 'sadly', 'dosent', 'happen.The', 'central', 'charachter', 'blind', 'teenager', 'named', 'Ivy', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'not', 'annoying', 'lukewarm', 'personality', 'never', 'felt', 'loved', 'future', 'husband', 'crucial', 'plot', 'What', 'really', 'strange', 'blindness', 'be', 'random', 'cane', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'most', 'time', 'other', 'moments', 'top', 'speed', 'field', 'bushy', 'area', 'rock', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'moment', 'when', 'someone', 'coming', 'up', 'Oh', 'Uh', 'what', 'Isint', 'supposed', 'be', 'blind', 'Aside', 'below-average', 'charachters', 'Village', 'luckster', 'terms', 'scares', 'nothing', 'really', 'scary', 'movie', 'will', 'admit', 'are', 'few', 'frightenig', 'moments', 'involving', 'creatures', 'woods', 'Speaking', 'creatures', 'one', 'thing', 'Shyamalan', 'get', 'right', 'creepy', 'monster', 'designs', 'When', 'see', 'beasts', 'do', 'have', 'great', 'design', 'thats', 'memorable', 'creepy.Probably', 'worst', 'thing', 'Village', 'third', 'act', 'Everything', 'story', 'completly', 'downhill', 'few', 'scenes', 'ruining', 'everything', 'monumental', 'mistake', 'Shyamalan', 'revealing', 'secret', 'creatures', 'woods', 'full', 'thiry', 'minutes', 'film', 'simply', 'inexcusable', 'result', 'horrendus', 'mistake', 'last', 'scenes', 'creatures', 'were', 'silly', 'knew', 'secret', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'what', 'ending', 'Shyamalan', 'trademark', 'simply', 'sad', 'was', 'small', 'suprise', 'when', 'began', 'see', 'rest', 'was', 'sad', 'sad', 'joke', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'credits', 'began', 'roll', 'first', 'thing', 'said', 'was', 'uh', 'what', 'ending', 'did', 'make', 'sense', 'was', 'not', 'confusing', 'was', 'bad', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Chud.com', 'DVD', 'review', 'suggestion', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'sadly', 'version', 'suggest', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Bottom', 'line', 'ending', 'dissapointing', 'easily', 'weakest', 'ending', 'Shyamalan', 'movies.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'withought', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'come', 'own', 'conclusion', 'sad', 'how', 'setting', 'creatures', 'are', 'fantastic', 'yet', 'charachters', 'plot', 'are', 'dull', 'How', 'sad']",N/A

859965,A1YRV8ICHSL41F,B00064LJVE,"Inchoatus.com ""Inchoatus.com""","[1, 3]","No one is making movies quite like Shyamalan. No one. His is a unique offering and his audience is becoming intensely loyal. It is a pleasure, in many respects, to see a director seek his own vision in his own way without any interference whatsoever. Art is not a thing made by a committee--despite what popular education today would have us feel. Shyamalan's movie-making (for as much as his politics would probably disagree) hearkens to Ayn Rand's Howard Roark in The Fountainhead: a man who will not be deterred from his vision and will accept no compromise. He is one who will not and can not stand to work with peers. There may be a movement in this... perhaps not of a particular style of movie-making (though Hollywood would do well to imitate some of his!) but rather a certain bravery in production that will allow some of the most innovative and imaginative story-tellers to weave their stories in uninterrupted fashion. That, we feel, would be Shyamalan's greatest contribution to the genre. There is no question that he is forcing critics and audiences to take the subject of speculative fiction seriously.WHO SHOULD WATCH THIS:Adherents of Shyamalan did not wait for our review to watch this movie. They have seen it. Probably more than once. And they have purchased it and shelved it next to Unbreakable and Signs. Perhaps they are here looking for the reasons why they love his films so much; we say it is for their purity. We believe that Shyamalan's productions are worthwhile for anyone to watch except for those super-action purists who must have explosions and battle; cursing and stoicism; bravado and irreverence. Shyamalan's perfect foil as a director is probably Quentin Tarantino--both are gifted visually and tell compelling tales but the reason they film and the things they explore couldn't possibly be more different. Where Tarantino seeks the edges of the human psyche and subverts them in reductio absurdeum attacks, Shyamalan infiltrates the psyche and strips away the odious barnacles of reality leaving a kind of Platonic ideal to his visions and his people. There is little likelihood that those who purchased Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill are just now investigating Shyamalan but they should probably avoid. If we were to rank Shyamalan's current corpus: we would say that The Village is as good as Unbreakable, which are both not quite as good as Sixth Sense (though more important thematically) but both better than Signs.WHO SHOULD AVOID:As we mentioned, come not here for combat, action, nor sex. The love here is a chaste love. Yet also, don't come to this movie expecting a ghost story because you won't find one. This isn't a movie about external fears of the supernatural but the internal fears that we carry with us. If you're looking for a good ol' fashioned slasher flick than go elsewhere for none of that is resident in the village. Blood is spilled--visibly--but artistically. For flayed flesh, murdered innocents, and mayhem, you'd be better served by the cerebral yet ultra-violent The Cube.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM",4,"It's Highly Allegorical--as as such, succeeds",1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,3079,"['one', 'making', 'movies', 'quite', 'Shyamalan', 'one', 'unique', 'offering', 'audience', 'becoming', 'intensely', 'loyal', 'pleasure', 'many', 'respects', 'see', 'director', 'seek', 'own', 'vision', 'own', 'way', 'interference', 'whatsoever', 'Art', 'not', 'thing', 'made', 'committee', 'what', 'popular', 'education', 'today', 'would', 'have', 'feel', 'Shyamalan', 'movie-making', 'as', 'much', 'politics', 'would', 'probably', 'disagree', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'Howard', 'Roark', 'Fountainhead', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'deterred', 'vision', 'will', 'accept', 'compromise', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'work', 'peers', 'may', 'be', 'movement', 'perhaps', 'not', 'particular', 'style', 'movie-making', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'imitate', 'rather', 'certain', 'bravery', 'production', 'will', 'allow', 'most', 'innovative', 'imaginative', 'story-tellers', 'weave', 'stories', 'uninterrupted', 'fashion', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'Shyamalan', 'greatest', 'contribution', 'genre', 'question', 'forcing', 'critics', 'audiences', 'take', 'subject', 'speculative', 'fiction', 'seriously.WHO', 'SHOULD', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'Adherents', 'Shyamalan', 'did', 'not', 'wait', 'review', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Probably', 'more', 'once', 'have', 'purchased', 'shelved', 'next', 'Unbreakable', 'Signs', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'here', 'looking', 'reasons', 'why', 'love', 'films', 'so', 'much', 'say', 'purity', 'believe', 'Shyamalan', 'productions', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'anyone', 'watch', 'super-action', 'purists', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'explosions', 'battle', 'cursing', 'stoicism', 'bravado', 'irreverence', 'Shyamalan', 'perfect', 'foil', 'director', 'probably', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'are', 'gifted', 'visually', 'tell', 'compelling', 'tales', 'reason', 'film', 'things', 'explore', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Where', 'Tarantino', 'edges', 'human', 'psyche', 'reductio', 'absurdeum', 'attacks', 'Shyamalan', 'psyche', 'away', 'odious', 'barnacles', 'reality', 'leaving', 'kind', 'Platonic', 'ideal', 'visions', 'people', 'little', 'likelihood', 'who', 'purchased', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'investigating', 'Shyamalan', 'should', 'probably', 'avoid', 'were', 'rank', 'Shyamalan', 'current', 'corpus', 'would', 'say', 'Village', 'as', 'good', 'Unbreakable', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'more', 'important', 'thematically', 'better', 'Signs.WHO', 'SHOULD', 'AVOID', 'mentioned', 'come', 'not', 'here', 'combat', 'action', 'sex', 'love', 'here', 'chaste', 'love', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'movie', 'expecting', 'ghost', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', ""n't"", 'movie', 'external', 'fears', 'supernatural', 'internal', 'fears', 'carry', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'ol', 'fashioned', 'slasher', 'flick', 'go', 'elsewhere', 'none', 'resident', 'village', 'Blood', 'spilled', 'visibly', 'artistically', 'flayed', 'flesh', 'murdered', 'innocents', 'mayhem', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'served', 'cerebral', 'yet', 'ultra-violent', 'Cube.READ', 'THE', 'ENTIRE', 'REVIEW', 'AT', 'INCHOATUS.COM']",N/A

I'm a huge fan of the writer/producer/director (Signs is my all time favorite movie), and an even bigger fan of Joaquin Phoenix.  I may have been blinded by the their light in regards to this movie...It bored me.  It couldn't make up its' mind as to whether or not it was a character study, (though it never stayed with any one character, with the possible exception of blind Ivy impossibly traipsing through the woods, for long), a horror movie or a romance, so all parts were muddled.  It wasn't in the least bit frightening.  And unfortunately, the twist this time is just transparent.I felt badly for 2 of my favorite actors, Joaquin and Oscar-winner Adrian Brody.  Joaquin's character Lucius had little more to do but hold hands with Ivy, look befuddled and grunt occasionally.

I seem to recall the story line concept from an old Twilight Zone episode, tho I haven't seen it in years. This doesn't surprise me as M. Night borrowed the storyline for Signs so directly from War of the Worlds. He seems to be pursuing the title of King of the remakes. Too many ""little"" things with the Village bothered me. As small cut off Village in the middle of nowhere, where did they get Glass for their windows, metal for their knives and utensils, oil for their night torches, new clothes etc. I didn't notice a glass factory, blacksmith shop, millwork or any other work place in the village, however they have all of the produce from them. Also, I was surprised to see the blind girl who is the central character of the movie run full speed across a field, wander thru the woods and navigate without hesitation down a cellar ladder when having known several blind people in my life, none of them would even dream of performing such feats even in their own homes. It just wasn't realistic. Finally to the story itself, I believe it would have been far better, if there truly had been ""something"" in the woods, a true adversary, a true ""boogie"" man. It beomes obvious early on that this isn't the case and that the village elders are behind the hoax. There are too many flaws in the plot logic to attempt to list, suffice it to say you have to suspend all reality to accept that the Village is actually what it prsenets itself to be and that no one within it has figured out the truth. I was very dissapointed by this, as I felt Sixth Sense was excellent and Unbreakable very good. M. Night as the park ranger at the end of the film was yet another borrow from Steven King, who borrowed the cameo concept from Hitchcock.

859972,A1A535W556ROBQ,B00064LJVE,James Ferguson,"[2, 3]","Shyamalan sets up an interesting premise but there are too few twists and turns to keep this movie compelling throughout.  He gives away the secret of the village too soon, offering little in the way of suspense to close out the movie.  Too bad because the film was relatively taut in the first half and enjoyable to watch.The premise is a village not much unlike that of a Shaker village nestled in the primordial woods.  The elders have chose to turn their backs on the town, keeping vigilant watch on the borders with the the dark forest that separates them from civilization.  Fine performances by Hurt, Weaver, and Phoenix keep this film moving along at a brisk pace.  M. Night captures the cadence of 18th century English, further lending to the old world air of this movie.  But, ultimately love turns into a near fatal dagger that forces a young blind woman to have to brave the hundred acre woods to find medicine for her fallen lover.Absurd as the premise of a blind woman forced to find her way through a forest to a town she has no idea where it lies, Shyamalan is able to create some air of suspense.  But, it was a little bit too much like The Blair Witch Project as she stumbles around the woods trying to find her bearings after her escorts forsake her.I suppose for younger audiences, a movie like this can be a lot of fun, but for older audiences it will be hard to stifle a smirk and a laugh from time to time.  Shyamalan is out of his realm in trying to create a Gothic movie.

859973,A2HCU3HYEYJELG,B00064LJVE,"James Gebhardt ""Film Addict""","[6, 7]","This is definitely one of those ""love it or hate"" it type of films. I belong to the former by the way :) Anyway, I think it was an ambitious sort of film that was not without serious flaws. I found the score (especially lead violinist, Hilary Hahn) and sound effects a perfect complement to the overall tone (no pun intended) of the film. In fact, I felt that the dominant violin gave momentum and a strong emotional identity to certain moments within the film.Important Side Note: Before I proceed any further I have to make something very clear - I've spent an inordinate amount of time reading other reviews of this film so much so in fact that I'm not sure if I'll be able to compose a completely original one myself without borrowing from someone else's thoughts. With that said, I will try to the best of my ability to remain as original as possible. If anyone sees anything similar to what they had written from here on in ... my humblest apologies! It was sincerely unintentional. Also, be forewarned - spoilers ahead so if you didn't see the film yet, you may want to wait before you read any of this.Moving on, I found that most of the ""a- list"" performers were basically too restrained and woefully underused throughout most of the film. I understand that these characters were supposed to be pragmatic people living in simpler times and not given to excessive verbosity but, it would've been nice have seen a couple of more dramatic speeches like the one given by William Hurt in which he was attempting to justify his unilateral decision to allow his daughter to go to the ""towns"". Although Sigourney Weaver had some dialogue, it seemed very inadequate and fine veteran actors such as Celia Weston did little more than offer up occasional facial gestures and body language throughout most of her scenes and that was a shame to see. I think this ended up being a bit of a miscalculation on Night's part. Maybe the film would've been better served by casting all the principals with unfamiliar actors. Sometimes it's good to ""anchor"" a film with a few familiar veteran actors but, in this case, I think it was more of a distraction from the human tapestry/community theme that was being presented at the outset of the story. When the focus ultimately shifted away from the village and on to Ivy's undertaking, I really felt a lot of that good talent went to waste. Maybe the distraction was part of Night's plan to surprise the audience with the sudden realitization that the true story of the village was really about the blind girl, Ivy rising up out of relative obscurity to become the main protagonist of the film. Night himself states, in the bonus section of the DVD, that the emergence of Ivy as heroine was the big ""secret"" in the story (as opposed to the ""O. Henry style twist"" at the end). I think it was intentional of Night to cast a ""not famous yet"" actress to play the part of Ivy in order to divert the audience's attention away from the big secret that was yet to unfold. She sort of blended in with the background of the story until the time was right for her to emerge and become the focal point. By the way, Howard's portrayal of Ivy is one of those special few performances that will haunt me and linger with me for a long time to come and if this is any indication, Bryce Dallas Howard will be a household name in no time. It was a wonderful and important breakthrough performance for this fine young actress.The film is full of allegory...political, social you name it. The story of Little Red Riding Hood has always been looked upon as a microcosm of the epic struggle between good and evil and the second half of this film (shall I say) borrows heavily from that fabled story. An innocent kind-hearted blind girl driven by a selfless sense of love and compassion for another human being... I know it's easy to be cynical and dismissive about this and see the film as being blatantly manipulative but, I made the leap of faith and allowed myself to be caught up with her struggle as well as the somewhat-misguided good-natured intentions of the village elders. We all know it's wrong to try to maintain a society through fear and intimidation but that seems all secondary to the notion of trying to make a better world for the ones that we love most and that's what Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), Ivy and the town elders were all attempting to at least try to do. And, we as the audience, already know the inherent futility in all of this and get a front row seat to witness the beginning of the end to this would-be Utopian experiment. How ironic that the elders attempted to create and control a manufactured community through fear, ignorance and intimidation ... the very same reasons they abandoned their own modern society. They should've know better and therein lies the tragedy in this gothic horror/romance. Their misguided attempt to preserve innocence was perhaps all in vain because what ultimately makes societies ""go bad"" comes from deep within the human condition and all attempts to isolate people from perceived ""bad"" external societal factors is the ultimate exercise in ignorance and futility. The ill-fated love triangle turned violent is a good case in point. William Golding's novel, ""Lord of the Flies"" addresses some of the very same issues.I also noticed a lot of symbolism throughout the film. I tend to overanalyze things more than I should but this is some of what I picked up on (don't laugh!):Ivy's passage through Covington Woods could be interpreted as a personal journey as opposed as a trip to ""the towns"" in order to retrieve medicine for the ailing Lucius. This purgatorial ""rite of passage"" (complete with sinkhole and sinister red monster) could symbolize Ivy's own personal pitfalls and inner fears. By defeating the creature, she conquered her own fears. By tricking him into killing himself is an act of self-consummation which, kharma-wise, serves as a fitting end for such a wretched creature not unlike the proverbial serpent swallowing its own tail. If you noticed, her final obstacle out of the woods was the ivy-covered wall. So, in a way, Ivy's final obstacle was herself - further bolstering the position that she was conquering herself and things within herself.The sinkhole could also represent the dark abyss that lurks within each and every one of us. Maybe poor Noah ended up falling into his own abyss - lying at the bottom of his own emotional pit of despair (and yes, I know an abyss is supposed to be bottomless).The creature could also be an external manifestation of Noah's (Adrien Brody) own anger, frustration and inability to express himself as others could. His own personal ""id monster"" perhaps.The red and yellow colors could be a swipe at our own national terror alert color coding - the inference being that color could be used to control and moderate the flow of the collective anxiety of a population of people (e.g. red = bad and yellow = not so bad). Combine that with the fact that the self-appointed leader's name is Walker - maybe an esoteric reference to George Herbert Walker Bush.The forest can be associated with fears of the unknown...fear of becoming lost amid a faceless, nameless uncaring society, and on and on and on.Like the fall of countless totalitarian societies throughout history and, on a much smaller scale, modern-day Amish and Shaker style communities... they're all doomed to eventual failure but not for lack of trying, mind you. Instead, the failure arises from man's attempts at suppressing the human spirit and his endless attempts at assuming the role of creator... never going to work. Personally, I kind of hope that the village survives (which is what the film suggests) but, I think it's only a matter of time before bigger and greater crises present themselves further weakening the framework of this particular society to the point of implosion. Then again, maybe I shouldn't be so pessimistic and maybe I should have more faith in the positive side of human nature and maybe that's a message that the film is trying to deliver as well.But what serves as an inspirational counterpoint to all of this is Ivy's success at overcoming every possible obstacle that life had placed before her to complete her mission driven only by her love and concern for Lucius and probably every other single member of that community. That's the heart of the film for me... boundless triumph of the human spirit. When society fails the individual, the individual somehow finds a way of redeeming society. That's the emotional core for me at least. That's what I'm taking away from all of this and that's why I go to the movies.Final thoughts: Excellent cinematography with wonderful use of light, shadows and fog. Remember how the homes were backlit in the evening? Great sound editing and awesome soundtrack. I loved all the taut, tense moments but the romance was what this story was all about.Best scene moment: When Lucius Hunt pulls Ivy into the house at the last possible second right before the creature was upon her. Everything was perfect - the violin, the camera angles, the looks on their faces... At that instant, I realized how destined they were for each other and how selfless their love was for each other. A perfect moment in film-making.",4,Almost gave it 5 stars,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,9271,"['definitely', 'one', 'love', 'hate', 'films', 'belong', 'former', 'way', 'Anyway', 'think', 'was',

A community of pilgrims have a situation where something is killing little animals ripping off their fur. The group of elders act as a Town Hall and settle all matters. They believe it may be a coyote or someone from another settlement.The people are told never to go into the forbidden woods.  There are poles and yellows flags warning them do to go beyond that point.At supper, they hear a howl of a creature in the woods.A nervous Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) asks the elders if permission if he can go into the forbidden woods to another town to get a supply of medicine and return.It was denied.  Other people have gone into the woods and have never returned.  They are found dead.The color ""red"" is not allowed in this community. If you see a red flower blooming, you must pluck it and bury it immediatly. If you have red berries, surely it means you have been in the woods.Lucius is getting wise.  He knows their are secrets in every corner of this community.Lucius opens a basement door and finds someone dressed a creature wearing a red robe. It may be someone from another settlement.  The alarm bell is rung.  Everyone must get into their basement for fear go getting killed.Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) is blind. She is not afraid of this creature.  She knows the truth.Also in the cast: William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Branden Gleeson, Cherry Jones, Adrien Brody, Celia Weston, John Christopher Jones, Judy Greer, Jordan Burt, Charlie McDermott.M.

859978,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00064LJVE,Jason,"[1, 2]","Let's get this out of the way: the acting in this movie is superb.  Aside from Adrien Brody's over-the-top portrayal of a retarded person of some kind, each character is very well acted and developed when necessary.  It's quite compelling; actually, the tension, fear, and ignorance of villagers is very realistic.In addition, the story is told well, with revelations coming at the appropriate moments.  The idea of running away from an increasingly perverse and corrupt society, something with which I can relate very intimately, is somewhat believable.  Even the ""wronged people keep the rest of the village in the dark by telling superstitious gibberish and scaring the kids with fake monsters to preserve their utopia""-angle is a stretch that is acceptable.There were a few things that just didn't seem right about the movie.  Why did the elders decide to use some variation of old English when the offspring would know no better?  Why did they choose the garb they did when they could just have easily made more contemporary clothes with comfort and without labels?  Forced anachronisticity is all it is.Aside from all that, the fact that the plane concept is barely touched is ludicrous.  Even if the land were below a no fly zone, it would have to have a ridiculously wide radius that prohibits sight of an airplane.  Picture a funnel, where the diameter at top is ten times that of the bottom, and you'll realize how idiotic this movie is without addressing this issue.  With one sonic boom, with one off course jet, with one airliner at about 20K on a bright and sunny day, or even a helicopter joyride gone astray, their secret is ruined.  And I won't even go into the thought of a wooded area without trespassing hunters, kids, or nature lovers, or the very real probability that one of the kids wouldn't be a complete sissy, and would eventually test the boundaries of society.It's a fun movie to watch if you can completely ignore the glaring plot-holes and like movies that are minor trainwrecks with highly predictable endings.",3,A future without planes,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,2042,"['Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'acting', 'movie', 'superb', 'Aside', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'over-the-top', 'portrayal', 'retarded', 'person', 'kind', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'developed', 'when', 'necessary', 'quite', 'compelling', 'actually', 'tension', 'fear', 'ignorance', 'villagers', 'very', 'realistic.In', 'addition', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'revelations', 'coming', 'appropriate', 'moments', 'idea', 'running', 'away', 'increasingly', 'perverse', 'corrupt', 'society', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'very', 'intimately', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'Even', 'wronged', 'people', 'keep', 'rest', 'village', 'dark', 'telling', 'superstitious', 'gibberish', 'scaring', 'kids', 'fake', 'monsters', 'preserve', 'utopia', '-angle', 'stretch', 'acceptable.There', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'movie', 'Why', 'did', 'elders', 'decide', 'use', 'variation', 'old', 'English', 'when', 'offspring', 'would', 'know', 'better', 'Why', 'did', 'choose', 'garb', 'did', 'when', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'easily', 'made', 'more', 'contemporary', 'clothes', 'comfort', 'labels', 'Forced', 'anachronisticity', 'fact', 'plane', 'concept', 'barely', 'touched', 'ludicrous', 'Even', 'land', 'were', 'fly', 'zone', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'ridiculously', 'wide', 'radius', 'sight', 'airplane', 'Picture', 'funnel', 'where', 'diameter', 'top', 'ten', 'times', 'bottom', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'how', 'idiotic', 'movie', 'addressing', 'issue', 'one', 'sonic', 'boom', 'one', 'off', 'course', 'jet', 'one', 'airliner', 'about', '20K', 'bright', 'sunny', 'day', 'even', 'helicopter', 'joyride', 'gone', 'astray', 'secret', 'ruined', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'thought', 'wooded', 'area', 'trespassing', 'hunters', 'kids', 'nature', 'lovers', 'very', 'real', 'probability', 'one', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complete', 'sissy', 'would', 'eventually', 'test', 'boundaries', 'society.It', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'can', 'completely', 'ignore', 'glaring', 'plot-holes', 'movies', 'are', 'minor', 'trainwrecks', 'highly', 'predictable', 'endings']",N/A
859979,AUKLLB4J4YHNA,B00064LJVE,Jason!,"[4, 5]","I finally watched The Village last night....two years after it's release.  Maybe that was a good thing. I still remember everybody saying it was crap, but I don't remember any of the reasons why, so the impact is gone and so I was more open to the film.The film is great.  I wouldn't say it's M. Night's best because I am still mulling over what the movie is exactly about.  Like, Signs was about faith and coincisence, and Unbreakable was about duality and love...I'm not sure yet what The Village is about.  Innocence, perhaps?Everybody should know enough from M. Night's past films' patterns not to expect anything going into the movie.  It's not going to be whatever he put on the cover.  I remember how this film was advertised, like it was a horror film....that probably had a lot to do with the negative reviews.  The marketting was attracting people that wanted to see a horror film!  Then when they didn't get one, of course they are going to diss it!  With that in mind, however, I can't think of how to appropriately advertise the film.I guess The Village is about secrets and innocence.  The selfish things we do to protect others, and run from our own fears.  ""Mama's gonna keep you right here, under her wing. She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing.""  I thought a bit the same as another reviewer who mentioned the post 9-11 USA, and how we are told of evildoers beyond the castle walls.  We are basicly given fear to keep us at home, and not to stray and be open and truly free.  Maybe the metaphor to current political strategies is a stretch, but that is definitely whats going on in the film.  The elders of The Village rule with fear.  Their system of implementing it is near perfect.  The only fault is that the utopia they've created, out of the desire to escape the true harshness of reality, simply cannot stand on its own.  People get hurt and they NEED professional medical treatment....treatment better than 1890's technology can provide.  Just as in real life, at some point somebody is going to say ""hey, why don't I go and see if our neighbor's can help?  Lets see how they handle this sort of injury.""  or they invent something.  In the film's case, a character chooses to seek medicine from outside the village.  Of course, that would destroy the utopia because the boy would see the true world.  He'd become curious, and he'd mention it to the people of the village and the selfish experiment would come to an end.You see this happen in religious groups, especially fundamentalist and rural religious groups.  At some point, a child will want to explore outside the prescribed worldview and prescribed reality.  People do this for many reasons.  ""Well, all those heathens sure are doing fine without coming to our church....there must be something somebody isn't telling me.""  Of course there's some secrets going on there.  And when the individual is refused permission to venture out into the world, the inventive person finds a way to get out anyway....and attains a form of 'awakening.'  The Village avoids that controversy by choosing the blind character to be the hero and leave the society for badly needed medicine.  She's literally blind.  She can't see the park ranger's land rover.  She can't see his walkie-talkie.  So instead of the bigger, more external conflict which would have ensued had she not been blind, rather we get to see that only the elders have an internal conflict to deal with now.  Should they tell the rest of the villagers about their terrible lie?  How many people will die for the sake of maintaining the peaceful culture they have grown?  With little crime.  Barely any violence. With no money.  Less sin. (some might notice that there is no church in the village)In the end, nothing is perfect.  Humanity has, as it's nature, a dark side.  Even in the carefully cultivated Oz the elders have created, they can't escape their own tradgic pasts.  And they can't escape the guilt of what they are doing to the innocent and naive. And there is little they can do to keep the people under perfect control.  Humans have faults. Humans have hopes.  Humans have powerful emotions that move them from time to time to press boundaries.  And that is exactly what happens.The shining ""remainder to the Matrix equation"" in the film is Adrien Brody's character....who suffers from a learning disablity of some sort.  The boy is unruly and wild.  Through this single fluke, this one monkey wrench nature thows in, a heinous act is committed. Violence born out of the human emotion of jealousy.  This starts a chain reaction of emotional decisions.  The emotionally irresponsible boy attempts to kill the man he is jealous of.  The dying man's fiance is moved by love to travel to the end of the world to save her beau. Neither the fear of the outside world which she has been indoctrinated with, nor her own blindness will stop her from doing all that she can to save the man she loves. The idea for the utopia was selfish and futile.  The boundaries we have are the boundaries we tear down.One person's idea of a perfect world is another person's prison.One's selfish decisions causually oppress everybody else.So anyway, the movie isn't about some monsters living in the woods.  If the general public would stop expecting to be spoonfed their entertainment in bite-size, watered-down, and spelled-out pieces then maybe the studios would release better product, like this film.  There's a lot going on in this film.  And much of it is pertinent to all of our lives.  Not just on that political metaphorical level, but in each of our individual human lives.  Parents, teachers, pastors, big brothers, big sisters...any role model or person in any sort of authority....and everybody else...we all have these dilemmas and decisions to make.  The Village is a nice expression based on this concept.",4,"When we stop expecting literalism, films are better.",1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,5859,"['finally', 'watched', 'Village', 'last', 'night',

859980,A2ZWTA18X37QOZ,B00064LJVE,"Jason Oey ""UltramarineX""","[2, 5]","**Warning: Spoilers ahead**There's no easy way to sugar coat this so I'm just going to come right out and say it. Out of all the movies I have seen by M. Night Shyamalan, The Village is without a doubt the weakest one he has made, and one of the biggest disappointments of the summer. Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing Shyamalan's last movie Signs. At the time, I thought Signs was his best work to date, and I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next. Or maybe I was expecting something from the movie that it had no intention of delivering. I wanted a movie as creepy as Signs, but instead I got a movie that was, at times, tedious. In the end though, I just can't recommend The Village.The premise of the movie centres on a close knit community who lives in the daily knowledge of dangerous creatures surrounding their village. Some critics (like Roger Ebert) have labeled the story as `hokey', but I don't think it's any hokier than some of Shyamalan's previous movies which deals with the undead, superheroes, and an alien invasion (which some of these same critics liked). My problem with the movie doesn't have anything to do with the premise itself, but with its execution. Signs was a movie that continuously had a sense of dread; that something simply felt amiss. We get none of that in The Village.Yes we get a few jolts once in a while, but in between we often get some pointless rambling about how the village should be run, that everyone has to bury anything with the `bad colour', and to not be afraid of `Those We Don't Speak Of', which brings me to my next point. Why do they call it the `bad colour' and not simply red, or `Those We Don't Speak Of' the creatures in the woods (or something like that). Will saying red somehow call the creatures forth from the woods? I'd like to know, but Shyamalan doesn't seem to care enough to explain. Now don't get me wrong, I love movies with a lot of dialogue, just as long as its not worthless talking. Maybe he added those terms (bad colour, etc.) into the movie to make it seem more `intelligent', but in my opinion without explaining the reasoning behind those and other terms it just seems pointless and stupid.The revelation about what the creatures truly were in the movie was a little disappointing. I won't divulge what the revelation was, but I will say that I couldn't help but feel somewhat cheated, but I was willing to accept it in the hopes that the ending would prove to be interesting. Ah yes...the ending. The signature twist ending that is the hallmark of Shyamalan's movies. I thought the ending was great in The Sixth Sense, okay in Unbreakable, and...not so good in Signs. Don't worry I won't reveal what the ending was, but only say that I had mixed feelings about. It was definitely something I had NO idea was coming, and this was both its strength and weakness. I like unexpected endings such as that in The Sixth Sense, but the ending in The Village was over the top (which is something I know many will disagree with) and, to be honest, unnecessary.On the other hand the acting in The Village was, on the whole, solid. The most notable standouts were Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. Phoenix plays the quiet Lucius Hunt. It was hilarious to watch one of the village girls profess her love for him, and watching him stand there with a deadpan expression on his face. Howard plays a blind villager named Ivy Walker. I immediately developed sympathy for her having to live the way she does, but she shows great fortitude throughout the movie, and it shows when should stood terrified outside of her house waiting for Lucius during an attack by the creatures, but never running away.M. Night Shyamalan is a director who his loaded with talent. But even the greatest directors will once in a rare while make a movie that is not up to the standards of their previous works. For Shyamalan The Village would be this movie. I also think that it's a wake up call for him, that he needs to start changing his twist ending shtick. I know that pretty much every movie watcher will expect some kind of payoff at the end when watching his movies, but it's starting to get really old, really fast. I still want to see what Shyamalan does for his next movie, but my expectations won't be so high the next time around.I give The Village a 5 out of 10.",2,"To put it simply, I was disappointed",1092873600,"08 19, 2004",2004,4348,"['**Warning', 'Spoilers', 'easy', 'way', 'sugar', 'coat', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'come', 'right', 'say', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Village', 'doubt', 'weakest', 'one', 'made', 'one', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'summer', 'Maybe', 'expectations', 'were', 'too', 'high', 'seeing', 'Shyamalan', 'last', 'movie', 'Signs', 'time', 'thought', 'Signs', 'was', 'best', 'work', 'date', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'next', 'maybe', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'movie', 'had', 'intention', 'delivering', 'wanted', 'movie', 'as', 'creepy', 'Signs', 'instead', 'got', 'movie', 'was', 'times', 'tedious', 'end', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Village.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'close', 'knit', 'community', 'who', 'daily', 'knowledge', 'dangerous', 'creatures', 'surrounding', 'village', 'critics', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'have', 'labeled', 'story', 'hokey', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'hokier', 'Shyamalan', 'previous', 'movies', 'deals', 'undead', 'superheroes', 'alien', 'invasion', 'same', 'critics', 'liked', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'premise', 'execution', 'Signs', 'was', 'movie', 'continuously', 'had', 'sense', 'dread', 'something', 'simply', 'felt', 'amiss', 'get', 'none', 'Village.Yes', 'get', 'few', 'jolts', 'once', 'while', 'often', 'get', 'pointless', 'rambling', 'how', 'village', 'should', 'be', 'run', 'everyone', 'bury', 'anything', 'bad', 'colour', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Speak', ""'"", 'next', 'point', 'Why', 'do', 'call', 'bad', 'colour', 'not', 'simply', 'red', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Speak', 'creatures', 'woods', 'something', 'Will', 'saying', 'red', 'somehow', 'call', 'creatures', 'forth', 'woods', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'Shyamalan', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'enough', 'explain', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'movies', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'worthless', 'talking', 'Maybe', 'added', 'terms', 'bad', 'colour', 'etc', 'movie', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'intelligent', 'opinion', 'explaining', 'reasoning', 'other', 'terms', 'just', 'pointless', 'stupid.The', 'revelation', 'what', 'creatures', 'were', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'what', 'revelation', 'was', 'will', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'cheated', 'was', 'willing', 'accept', 'hopes', 'ending', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'interesting', 'Ah', 'yes', 'ending', 'signature', 'twist', 'ending', 'hallmark', 'Shyamalan', 'movies', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'great', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'okay', 'Unbreakable', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'Signs', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'ending', 'was', 'only', 'say', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'was', 'definitely', 'something', 'had', 'NO', 'idea', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'strength', 'weakness', 'unexpected', 'endings', 'such', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'ending', 'Village', 'was', 'top', 'something', 'know', 'many', 'will', 'disagree', 'be', 'honest', 'unnecessary.On', 'other', 'hand', 'acting', 'Village', 'was', 'whole', 'solid', 'most', 'notable', 'standouts', 'were', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Phoenix', 'quiet', 'Lucius', 'Hunt', 'was', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'one', 'village', 'girls', 'love', 'watching', 'stand', 'deadpan', 'expression', 'face', 'Howard', 'blind', 'villager', 'named', 'Ivy', 'Walker', 'immediately', 'developed', 'sympathy', 'having', 'live', 'way', 'great', 'fortitude', 'movie', 'when', 'should', 'stood', 'terrified', 'house', 'waiting', 'Lucius', 'attack', 'creatures', 'never', 'running', 'away.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'director', 'who', 'loaded', 'talent', 'even', 'greatest', 'directors', 'will', 'once', 'rare', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'up', 'standards', 'previous', 'works', 'Shyamalan', 'Village', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'also', 'think', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'start', 'changing', 'twist', 'ending', 'shtick', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'watcher', 'will', 'expect', 'kind', 'payoff', 'end', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'starting', 'get', 'really', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'still', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'Shyamalan', 'next', 'movie', 'expectations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'high', 'next', 'time', 'around.I', 'give', 'Village', '5', '10']",N/A

And the bustle this movie made before it's release was impressive. Who could resist it's teasers. I sure couldn't. I couldn't remember a better marketing drive. The use of cinematic mastery to depict the taboo qualities of red, the rules of a secluded village. I never doubted the story telling abilities of Night, and was very excited in anticipation of this movie. A movie with a monster that seemed fresh to me. But then after watching this movie, which I will not give away, I was flummoxed as to why he would tred down such a cliche story, with such a wonderful approach! If only this movie would have lived up to it's hype, but the same could be said of most movies today. ESP, episode 1,2 of star wars. As with all Night movies, the power is in the climax. You never know when in fact he will drop it on you, such as in the sixth sense, and then Signs, where you see that every act and moment is fatalistic. A dread surrounds his film, A  mystery that deserves to be brought to light. Such as how could a man survive a wreck in which none survived, or what plagues a boy's mind. The mysterious climax was revealed too soon, I mean, that is the power of the film, and in no other film is it's placement more obvious to be a priority in need!

859988,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00064LJVE,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 6]","M. Night Shyamalan definitely did himself a disservice in releasing ""The Sixth Sense"". Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director. And so, Shyamalan has been trying with every single outing since to recapture that sense of awe.Although many have made scathing remarks about the ending of ""The Village"", it is perhaps his most perfect since ""The Sixth Sense""; though by no means a huge surprise, it nevertheless settles into the ambiance and leaves the film with a tinge of melancholy that belies the trailers. It's probably not fair to keep comparing Shyamalan's work to his first big hit, one of the best psychological horror films ever made. A director could work his entire career and never make a SINGLE film as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", let alone recapture that movie's amazing brilliance. ""The Village"" does continues Shyamalan's pattern of there being twists in the plot, but this time there are SEVERAL of them and they occur sporadically throughout the film...  and not just one big bang. As far as the quality of the film... it is solid.The characters here are very rich, and their interactions and relationships with one another are very rewarding in big and small ways. The acting is phenomenal, most noticeably by Academy Award winner Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) lights up the screen in an astounding premiere performance as the blind Ivy, Adrien Brody delivers a searing portrayal of longing as the dim-witted Noah and Joaquin Phoenix heightens the moody tone with his strong, silent-type Lucius. ""The Village"" is about these people, this community living in fear, not the monsters of which they have been warned; it is about the psychology of fear rather than a horrific portrayal of it.

859989,AZ515FFZ7I2P7,B00064LJVE,Jerry Jackson Jr.,"[8, 8]","Let me start out by saying that I love M. Night Shyamalan's work. I even loved MOST of this film. I won't give away the surprise for those of you who still haven't seen it, but I'll voice my opinion as to why so many people have written negative reviews of this movie.Long story short: there was no point to the twist ending other than the twist ending.In Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, the twist at the end of the movie was essential to leading the main character to the next stage of his life (or afterlife). In Unbreakable, the twist ending resulted in a revelation for both the main characters and further established Willis' character as a hero in the minds of the audience. In Signs, the twist ending completely changes the way Mel Gibson's character views the world/universe and our place in it ... allowing him to reclaim his lost faith. In all of these movies the twist ending was the foundation for the final scenes of the film ... creating a frame for Shyamalan to say ""this is the point of the movie.""In The Village, the twist ending comes and it reveals ... nothing but the twist ending. Yes, the twist was cool and it makes you view the whole movie in a different way (just like in Shyamalan's previous films), but this time there was no clear point to the twist. None of the characters had a true life changing moment as a result of the twist in The Village. I mean, imagine if in The Matrix everyone discovered that the world is a computer-generated hoax and the reaction from the characters was ""So what?"" When a plot twist radically changes EVERYTHING in the lives of your characters you need to show the audience that this change MATTERS in the lives of your characters. Shyamalan gave us an AMAZING twist in The Village, and the characters in the film couldn't have cared less. You can argue ""that"" was the point (that no one in the village cared) ... but I don't think so.If the characters in a movie don't care about what happens to them, then neither will the audience ... and that's why I suspect so many people felt let down by The Village.",3,A beautiful film that falls apart at the end,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,2063,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'love', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'work', 'even', 'loved', 'MOST', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'surprise', 'who', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'voice', 'opinion', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie.Long', 'story', 'short', 'was', 'point', 'twist', 'ending', 'other', 'twist', 'ending.In', 'Shyamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'twist', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'essential', 'leading', 'main', 'character', 'next', 'stage', 'life', 'afterlife', 'Unbreakable', 'twist', 'ending', 'resulted', 'revelation', 'main', 'characters', 'further', 'established', 'Willis', 'character', 'hero', 'minds', 'audience', 'Signs', 'twist', 'ending', 'completely', 'way', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'world/universe', 'place', 'allowing', 'reclaim', 'lost', 'faith', 'movies', 'twist', 'ending', 'was', 'foundation', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'creating', 'frame', 'Shyamalan', 'say', 'point', 'movie', 'Village', 'twist', 'ending', 'nothing', 'twist', 'ending', 'Yes', 'twist', 'was', 'cool', 'view', 'whole', 'movie', 'different', 'way', 'just', 'Shyamalan', 'previous', 'films', 'time', 'was', 'clear', 'point', 'twist', 'None', 'characters', 'had', 'true', 'life', 'changing', 'moment', 'result', 'twist', 'Village', 'mean', 'imagine', 'Matrix', 'everyone', 'discovered', 'world', 'computer-generated', 'hoax', 'reaction', 'characters', 'was', 'So', 'what', 'When', 'plot', 'twist', 'radically', 'EVERYTHING', 'lives', 'characters', 'need', 'show', 'audience', 'change', 'MATTERS', 'lives', 'characters', 'Shyamalan', 'gave', 'AMAZING', 'twist', 'Village', 'characters', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'can', 'argue', 'was', 'point', 'one', 'village', 'cared', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.If', 'characters', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'then', 'will', 'audience', 'why', 'suspect', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'Village']",N/A

I loved his first big hit, ""The Sixth Sense"", a movie that did everything right: great cast, great story line, outstanding production values and a director's viewpoint that didn't sneer at his audience. You beheld a unique filmmaker who put his brilliant imprint on everything in this production. ""The Village"" turns out to be nothing more than an expanded ""TWilight Zone"" episode. Except ""Twilight Zone"" didn't cheat its viewers. In ""The Village,"" there are no chills, no suspense and you're left with an overhyped drama where everyone talks in whispers and they act real scared everytime they look at the woods. This is supposed to be a parable but when several of my friends watched this DVD with me, most had picked up a magazine to read halfway through. Nothing in this flick connected with us. There were nonstop close-ups of excrutiating length. You kept muttering, ""Okay, we've got the close-up---now move it!"" Here's a revolutionary suggestion: Shyamalan needs to study the early work of Tobe Hooper, Brian DePalma and George Romero to see raw, unvarnished film-making that proves exhilirating to the viewer because these filmmakers poured their passion into their work. They sweated blood in the horror genre to create brilliant, fresh looks at worn-out formulaes and made them alive. Shyamalan is becoming increasingly like a smug movie producer/director who believes his own press and has forgotten about his audience.

859991,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00064LJVE,J from NY,"[5, 14]","The only reason I had any interest in ""The Village"" at all was a slight misperception: I thought, with the red markings on the doors and the archaic symbolism, that it might have something to do with MR James ""Casting the Runes"" or the original film version of that incredible story, ""Curse of the Demon"".It doesn't, and I'm proud to say that's the only reason I bothered with this garbage.  To horror fans: this is NOT a horror movie.  It is yet another big budget failure on the part of M. Night Shyamalan, who to this viewer has yet to prove himself as a director of any uniqueness or originality.  ""The Sixth Sense"" has to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen, and fortunately this one didn't fool anybody.  His ""trick"" formula at the end of his films doesn't work very well, since by the time we reach the end we're so bored and amused by the bad performances and absurd plots that we don't really care what the surprise is.I don't know what he was aiming for with this.  It doesn't work as a mystery, horror, or even a romance.  Even the veterans of Hollywood like Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt turn in mediocre performances.  They probably just needed work.The plot is barely worth getting into.  A village of people who live sorta like puritans (minus any ascetic intensity, or intensity of any kind) are afraid of ""those they don't speak of"", creatures they believe live in the woods.  We find out very quickly that these creatures are merely costumes and that the whole thing is a ploy by ""the elders"" to keep them away from modern civilization.

Night Shyalaman's latest effort, and I think this is part of the problem some people had with the film.  Much like Rod Serling did with the ""Twilight Zone"", Shyalaman uses devices like ghosts, aliens, or monsters to try to make a larger point.  And much like Serling, Shyalaman can get some mixed results.  For every classic episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" there were several episodes that, while entertaining, were rather silly and forgettable.  Similarly, ""The Village"" may not be quite as satisfying as Shyalaman's previous efforts. I think Shyalaman may go a bit far in trying for a sort of double twist ending, and again, I think this threw some viewers off.  ""The Village"" does have some scary moments, though, and I give Shyamalan credit for his originality, and for trusting the audience to think a little while they are being entertained.  I'd also point out that Shyamalan succeeds in making the audience want the monsters in the film to be real, even when their nature, is called into question.  The final twist in the film is as unexpected (in my opinion, anyway) as any that Shyamalan has created.  ""The Village"" may be more flawed than M. Night Shyalaman's previous efforts, but I must point out again that Shyalaman is at least trying something different, and the result is an entertaining if flawed film.As a post-script, I've read some reviews elsewhere that tried to portray this film as somehow political.  I didn't see this at all, and I'd go so far to say, with all due respect, that those who read any political message into this film may need to try harder to let go of their political agendas long enough to enjoy a movie.

860001,A153MVFR0FTI6O,B00064LJVE,John Nelson,"[0, 0]","Much like what can be called Shyamalan's sophmore slump UNBREAKABLE, this is one of those ""watch it once"" movies since you can only really enjoy this movie once, and UNBREAKABLE at least was a bit of a surprise.  Shyamalan is a great talent, someone who wants to make movies with real characters, action and thrills, but his well is running dry and if he doesn't dig deeper he may lose his fans to the next new talent with a cool idea for a film.THE VILLAGE is one of those ""best looking bad movies"" a movie where the plot and the story is so lame or predictable (the plot came to me as I was thinking of old commercials for tv shows like Alien Autopsy and Discovering the Titanic, think about it or email me if you want my insight on this) but the rest of the movie is beautiful with a good atmosphere and characters you like, remember and can believe.  The movie almost depends on the characters too much to fill in the holes where we are expecting to see the monsters jump out on you and shock.  I don't mind seeing movie characters talk and discuss things be it the problem at hand or their lives but when your watching a movie where it's billed as a thriller where these characters will be in peril or in trouble (much like SIGNS) and your given something else, it's a buzzkill of sorts.  You sit down wanting a cheeseburger and you get grilled chicken, yeah it's good, but not what I wanted or expected.Thats another problem with the movie and it's happened before with movies where in the commercials show you all the good parts.  If you've seen the commercials you've seen all the best parts, and if the thriller elements are all your interested in, then you gotta pass.  There are a couple more that weren't shown and they were only okay.I can lay down a good law for movies right now and this goes right back up to my first paragraph, ANY movie where you can see the ending coming and your correct about it, will more then likely dissapoint you and if it's a twist ending that you see, double the dissapointment, (triple it if the movie telegraphs its ending a mile away twist or no).

860002,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00064LJVE,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[3, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***To be uncharacteristically succinct, I think ""The Village"" was an inept blend of ""The Truman Show"", ""The Twilight Zone"", ""The Prisoner"", and ""Scooby Doo"" (the elders would have gotten away with it too, were it not for the meddling kids Lucius and Ivy). Admittedly, its themes of secure utopia (and the lengths people will reach to preserve it) and the ""woods as labyrinthine hell"" metaphor were intriguing and thought-provoking, but I felt M. Night Shyamalan's framework for presenting these themes was too contrived, attenuated, silly and inconsistent to be effective. As a 30-minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode, the premise would have had more shocking impact. As a feature-length movie, it appeared amateurish and pretentious instead, with too many plot and logic holes. Perhaps Mr. Shyamalan should have presented his themes in a straightforward way, without ""the past is really the present"" or ""it was Earth all along - god damn you all to hell"" twist, and really achieved the ultimate twist of having no twist.One can forgive a movie's lapses in logic if they are infrequent and the movie is basically intelligent and entertaining, but I felt ""The Village"" is truly neither. The dialogue is self-consciously excruciatingly stilted, the characters' actions stupefying (i.e. Lucius has been stabbed twice in the abdomen; his life is dribbling away, will SOMEBODY get the medicine already? and ""Ivy, get down in the cellar already?""), the ""monsters"" shoddily anthropomorphic and the ending inert. I did like the atmosphere and cinematography, however, but it was small compensation for this ""house of cards"" movie. To play devil's advocate for a moment, perhaps Mr. Shyamalan deliberately and perversely made his movie imperfect to inspire thoughtful commentary and discussion (is THIS the ultimate twist?)Now I present a list of plot/logic lapses designed to prompt ""You Gotta Be Kiddling Me"" responses:1. Could even a billionaire arrange to prevent airplanes from flying over the woodlands preserve?2. Those poles the villagers were painting the mollifying color yellow sure looked like telephone poles.3. Would you put a monster suit in a cellar where the village idiot would have ready access to it?4. Would any rational, humane person send a blind girl (no matter how stereotypically pure and resourceful, since of course blind people are always above reproach, unflinchingly brave, and possess extrasensory perception - is she Daredevil's daughter?) alone into the woods for medicine? That is cruel and unusual punishment violating the 8th amendment!5. To protect the ""idyllic"", ""pristine"" village from the encroachment of evil civilization, wouldn't you need an army of security personnel? Only one appears in the movie and, even though he's apparently a novice, he seemed useless.6. Cut off from the outside world, how can the village sustain itself for any period of time? Wouldn't the inhabitants go mad being restricted to the village limits? Curiosity will ultimately surmount fear.7. As my friend Joe Flynn, who watched the movie with me, said, ""Wouldn't some stoned teenagers trespass into the woodland preserve and stumble upon the village?""

The surprise ending is not the same as the Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, it actually takes down the movie some considerable notches and adds nothing to it. What this film maker was thinking when he did this is beyond me. I will not give away the ending, but I will tell the truth that this is not or horror movie or a true monster movie. This is a human drama dealing with what appears to be an Hamish village, or one from another time. During the course of the story, the village idiot stabs the son of highest elder and they send a blind girl out into the woods to some nearby towns to get some medicine for him. Every single ad for this film suggests woods filled with bizarre creatures attacking people, this is purposefully dressed up as something that it is not.

Night Shyamalan has brought us shocking and original films that have frightened us and made us think about life and things we care for most. And Night's films are always dramatic with suspenseful moments. The Sixth Sense taught us about life, Unbreakable showed us that we should go out and do what God planned for us to do, and Signs shows us that everything happens for a reason.The Village shows us what happens when we try to protect those we love the most. And also what someone would do to save the person they truly love. M. Night Shyamalan really shines in this film. Jaquin Pheonix plays in his best acting job yet as a young boy destined to help the people of his village by planning to venture out into the forbbiden woods. Bryce Dallas Howard is what I can see to become the next big actress. She was phenomenal as Ivy Walker. Adrien Brody plays a very intresting mentaly disabled man. Other village members and great performances include William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, Brenden Gleesen,Judy Greer, and the rest of the elders.The Music to the film is one of the best scores I have ever heard in my entire life. James Newton Howard does a great job. Roger Deakins lighting was spectacular aswell.SIDE NOTE:Do NOT go see this film OR complain this film if you are wanting to get scared out of your skin. Movie Trailer NEVER make a movie look how it really is. The Village is being looked at by everyone as a Horror slasher film. In fact it is a Romatic Horror film. But it is very dramatic, with SOME frightening sequences. This film is just amazing. And I don't believe people are really giving this film or M. Night Shyamalan a real chance.

At first, it seems an idyllic settlement. But we soon learn that the trees harbor monsters that will ostensibly assault anyone foolish enough to venture beyond the well-defined (with torches and yellow flags) town perimeter into the undergrowth. As long as the human inhabitants stay within the prescribed limits, and don't allow the display of anything colored red - even flowers - the goblins will tolerate their presence according to some unspecified ""truce"". The community is ruled by a council of elders, chief among whom are Edward Walker (William Hurt) and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver). It's apparent the burg needs to chill out, perhaps with the help of a pub or two and a house of ill repute.The film's lead female character is Ivy Walker, appealingly played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Ivy is the blind, yet wise and plucky, young woman that falls for the lumpish and taciturn Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix). After the latter falls afoul of the village idiot, Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), and his knife, Ivy volunteers to traverse the dreaded wilderness to the next town for the medicines that will save her beloved. (Why nobody from a neighboring town ever travels to the home village is ever explained.) It's on this quest that the audience discovers the true nature of the village and its besiegers.The morale of the story is that Man's fears can be self-created, yet can be otherwise useful in keeping the population at large in psychological thrall, like the Red Menace of the Cold War era reported by the government to be poised to rape Mom and pillage the apple pie of the Free World, or the Bogey Man under the bed postulated by parents to keep unruly offspring under control.Admittedly, the ending to THE VILLAGE did cause me to slightly raise an eyebrow in deference to a mildly clever twist, but the lead-up to it was too long and unengaging to ultimately justify the viewing experience.",2,Mind the Bogey Man under the bed!,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2163,"['VILLAGE', 'perhaps', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'provide', 'laconic', 'wryly', 'humorous', 'introduction.The', 'American', 'village', 'question', 'set', 'depths', 'forest', 'apparently', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'first', 'idyllic', 'settlement', 'soon', 'learn', 'trees', 'harbor', 'monsters', 'will', 'ostensibly', 'assault', 'anyone', 'foolish', 'enough', 'venture', 'well-defined', 'torches', 'yellow', 'flags', 'town', 'perimeter', 'undergrowth', 'As', 'long', 'human', 'inhabitants', 'stay', 'prescribed', 'limits', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'display', 'anything', 'colored', 'red', 'even', 'flowers', 'goblins', 'will', 'tolerate', 'presence', 'according', 'unspecified', 'truce', 'community', 'ruled', 'council', 'elders', 'chief', 'whom', 'are', 'Edward', 'Walker', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Alice', 'Hunt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'apparent', 'burg', 'chill', 'out', 'perhaps', 'help', 'pub', 'two', 'house', 'ill', 'repute.The', 'film', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'Ivy', 'Walker', 'appealingly', 'played', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Ivy', 'blind', 'yet', 'wise', 'plucky', 'young', 'woman', 'lumpish', 'taciturn', 'Lucius', 'Hunt', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'latter', 'afoul', 'village', 'idiot', 'Noah', 'Percy', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'knife', 'Ivy', 'volunteers', 'traverse', 'dreaded', 'wilderness', 'next', 'town', 'medicines', 'will', 'save', 'beloved', 'Why', 'nobody', 'neighboring', 'town', 'ever', 'home', 'village', 'ever', 'explained', 'quest', 'audience', 'true', 'nature', 'village', 'besiegers.The', 'morale', 'story', 'Man', 'fears', 'can', 'be', 'self-created', 'can', 'be', 'otherwise', 'useful', 'keeping', 'population', 'large', 'psychological', 'thrall', 'Red', 'Menace', 'Cold', 'War', 'era', 'reported', 'government', 'be', 'poised', 'rape', 'Mom', 'pillage', 'apple', 'pie', 'Free', 'World', 'Bogey', 'Man', 'bed', 'postulated', 'parents', 'keep', 'unruly', 'offspring', 'control.Admittedly', 'ending', 'THE', 'VILLAGE', 'did', 'cause', 'slightly', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'deference', 'mildly', 'clever', 'twist', 'lead-up', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'unengaging', 'ultimately', 'justify', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A
860007,A86OI3JXIV1LN,B00064LJVE,Josh,"[4, 7]","It's rare to see an intellectual thriller as good as the four which Shyamalan has produced; not since the days of old have we been treated to four finer films that delve into the very essence of what it means to human. And with 'The Village', Shyamalan delivers what is certainly not his best film, but is still an amazingly captivating experience in the dramatic form of Alfred Hitchcock with a Rod Serling morality play thrown into the mix. 'The Village' is as well crafted as it is intense; as well-acted as it is real to humanity; as well photographed as it is surreal.Composer James Newton Howard's score even plays a heavily dramatic role --in a way, its own character-- in this film and the solo violin playing of Hilary Hahn is part --almost its own character, really-- of what adds the depth, character, and weight to this picture. Roger Deakins' cinematography accentuates the beautiful and the horrific all with one fell stroke of the camera lens, and Shyamalan's writing and directing are as solid and as steadfast and as unwavering as ever.The twist isn't what makes this film though, as much as critics would have the public belive; it's a means to an end, really. . . no more, no less. The true nature of this film lies what is beyond the twist. . . what lies within the realm of the &quot;twist&quot;ed nature of the human mind and society as a whole and is a powerful moral tale of perfection begetting imperfection. Of supposed purity begetting sinfulness. The critics who miss out on this aspect of the film are the ones who seem to hate it the most.Its sad to think that there are people out there who will watch this movie and never realize its true intent. . . its true power and purpose. Its even more sad to think that people will walk out of this film because they were expecting a slasher/scare-you-to-death type of film. As I said, it is a heavily dramatic film. . . more suspenseful and intense than downright scary or terrifying. It is a story filled with love. . . doubt. . . courage. . . anger. . . but, above all, fear and what it means. It is a tale of how fear manipulates, deceives, and tricks us all.Those who understand this film will whole-heartedly enjoy it; those who are endlessly lost by its well-developed characters, purposefully drawn-out dialogues, and bewitching storyline (the reality of what others have labeled as &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;boring&quot;) will --sadly enough-- hate it, and it really is their true loss. Slasher films are forgotten because of their predictability. . . their liking of showing too much with too much brute visual force. Shyamalan's films require brain power. . . require the audience to fill in the blank spaces. . . to walk in the corners of their mind they hate to venture into.Much of the criticism over this film (and Unbreakable) reminds me of the reviews Hitchcock got over many of his pictures. . . critics panned such well-revered classics as Psycho and Vertigo as nonsense. . . ridiculous. . . too confusing; yet now, critics praise both films to the heavens now that the truths of both films have been revealed and are widely understood for their impact and force. I deeply feel this is the way Shyamalan's films will be treated in the coming years as people begin to understand the inner workings of the films and realize what masterpieces such films as this truly are.So, if you were put off by the mind-trips of Shyamalan's previous three ventures, you'd best skip this one and see something more along the lines of &quot;Harold & Kumar&quot; or &quot;King Arthur&quot;. Those movies will be forgotten in time and I'll be quite happy when I'm older to see Shyamalan's films still watched and admired the world over for their originality, boldness, and forthright gestures about what it means to be human. . . about accepting destiny. . . about re-finding faith. . . and about the dangers that fear can wreak on us.Highly, highly recommended for those with open minds and who have plenty of time to mull over the material presented and discuss its complexities and puzzles.",5,M.

860008,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00064LJVE,Josh Hitchens,"[3, 6]","M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" is a big fat miscalculation. Wonderfully directed as it is by the man who has single-handedly revived the horror genre, it is amazingly shallow. It concerns the inhabitants of a 19th century village surrounded by a forbidden forest. The people of the village are good, honest folk who are trying to make better lives for themselves after being touched by violence. But all of the people seem to share a dark secret, and the surrounding woods are inhabited by terrifying creatures that begin to threaten them.The story, such as it is, centers around a spunky blind girl named Ivy, the daughter of the village's leader (William Hurt). Ivy is played by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, and it is her performance that keeps the movie from being a complete train wreck. She has a very strong screen presence, and basically carries the entire movie by herself, since the other actors are barely present. Howard gives a convincing, emotionally affecting turn that is better than the actual movie. Ivy is in love with a brooding, morose man named Lucius, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix is playing against type here, we don't often see him playing weak, vulnerable characters. Lucius is the only character besides Ivy that you remotely care about, and Phoenix's performance is good, so it's a shame he's only in the first half of the movie.Shyamalan assembled an impressive cast for his fourth film, and they are all wasted beyond human comprehension. William Hurt stands around spouting pompous dialogue, Sigourney Weaver could have been very interesting but is given absolutely nothing to do, and Adrien Brody stumbles around playing the local idiot, giving a performance worthy of a five year old and making us wonder why he beat Daniel Day-Lewis at last year's Oscars. But this is not really the actors' fault. The blame lies squarely on the fact that Shyamalan's screenplay is muddled and mediocre.There are several genuinely terrifying moments once Ivy ventures alone into the ominous woods, and some interesting suspense, but it isn't nearly enough. When the big twist finally comes, it doesn't really matter at all, because there is so little substance to what has gone before it. ""The Village"" could have been a great movie had the screenplay gone through another rewrite and the characters become more than background scenary. I still recommend it, despite these reservations. It has a lot of good in it -- chiefly Shyamalan's atmospheric direction and Bryce Dallas Howard's performance. It's no surprise that Howard landed the plum job of replacing Nicole Kidman in Lars von Trier's ""Manderlay."" She deserves it for her effort here.""The Village"" is not a bad movie.

It felt more like contemporary in an Amish-like setting.  But even though that aspect did not seep in, I still found the story to be brilliant.We start with a funeral for a young child.  After the funeral we start to see the Amish-like community and almost immediately become aware of things in the surrounding woods.  The village is surrounded by a forest and there is a border.  On the other side there are those that are not spoken of; dangerous and intelligent creatures that keep the village isolated.But things start to happen as small animals are found mutilated.  As the elders try to maintain calm, more events occur and it seems like the creatures are no longer peaceful.  One young man is convinced that they should send someone to the town to retrieve medicines that could help prevent deaths like the one at the start of the film.  Eventually a villager does need to travel through the woods to the towns for medicine.  This is not a decision that is made lightly.As the story continues to unfold we get revelation after revelation until the whole brilliant tableau is revealed like a jigsaw puzzle.This is a hard film to promote.  Unlike The Sixth Sense where the whole film could be described up to the surprise, this one can't be described without giving away some of the film's secrets.  Finding out those secrets is part of the wonder of this film.  The cast is made almost entirely of Oscar and Tony winners and nominees.  One of the strongest casts I have ever seen.  While other films by the director can be summed up simply (a boy sees dead people, a man believes in super heroes, aliens arrive), there is no simple phrase to describe this one and that probably is what hurt it in the theaters with viewers hoping for a creepy monster movie and getting something completely surprising.",5,Those We Don't Speak Of -- Genius,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,1895,"['Let', 'first', 'say', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'period', 'piece', 'was', 'intended', 'feel', 'felt', 'more', 'contemporary', 'Amish-like', 'setting', 'even', 'aspect', 'did', 'not', 'seep', 'still', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'brilliant.We', 'start', 'funeral', 'young', 'child', 'funeral', 'start', 'see', 'Amish-like', 'community', 'almost', 'immediately', 'become', 'aware', 'things', 'surrounding', 'woods', 'village', 'surrounded', 'forest', 'border', 'other', 'side', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'spoken', 'dangerous', 'intelligent', 'creatures', 'keep', 'village', 'isolated.But', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'small', 'animals', 'are', 'found', 'mutilated', 'elders', 'try', 'maintain', 'calm', 'more', 'events', 'occur', 'creatures', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'peaceful', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'convinced', 'should', 'send', 'someone', 'town', 'retrieve', 'medicines', 'could', 'help', 'prevent', 'deaths', 'one', 'start', 'film', 'Eventually', 'villager', 'need', 'travel', 'woods', 'towns', 'medicine', 'not', 'decision', 'made', 'story', 'unfold', 'get', 'revelation', 'revelation', 'whole', 'brilliant', 'tableau', 'revealed', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle.This', 'hard', 'film', 'promote', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'where', 'whole', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'surprise', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'described', 'giving', 'away', 'film', 'secrets', 'Finding', 'out', 'secrets', 'part', 'wonder', 'film', 'cast', 'made', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Oscar', 'Tony', 'winners', 'nominees', 'One', 'strongest', 'casts', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'director', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'simply', 'boy', 'dead', 'people', 'man', 'super', 'heroes', 'aliens', 'arrive', 'simple', 'phrase', 'describe', 'one', 'probably', 'what', 'hurt', 'theaters', 'viewers', 'hoping', 'creepy', 'monster', 'movie', 'getting', 'something', 'completely', 'surprising']",N/A

I did not like the 1st one and the 2nd one was brilliant. But this 1st twist was a cliche and just kind of ruined the film for me. Now on 2nd viewing however I did like it, but I think it remains Shyamalans worst film. He had a great premise, he just messed upa little bit. Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt,Sigourney Weaver, and Adrien Brody are all great, but it is Howard who gives the best performance in the film. After the death of a young child, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) asks the village elders to let him venture into the woods, which are haunted by seemingly large porcupines, and go to the towns and retrieve medicines for other people who may be sick. The elders decline.Then, we venture into Lucius's love life with Ivy (Howard) much to the dissapointment of the village idiot Noah (Brody). When a major event happens however, Ivy must venture into the woods alone. Now the ""creatures"" that lurk in the woods are very cool looking. The costume designer did quite well and as usual Shyamalan throws in his signature twists.

860011,A34KMBISGBIBK1,B00064LJVE,"J. Perrotta ""screamqueen73""","[3, 15]","I have to say that I'm surprised at how many positive reviews because there are monstrous (no pun intended) problems with this one and its surprising that there are so many forgiving movie-goers out there.  I love Shyamalan's other films, especially Signs, which was such an underrated film in its beauty and artistry, but this one, YIKES! I have tried very hard to like this movie but after viewing two times, there is hardly anything positive I can think to say except that I did get a good nap during my second viewing.  To begin with, didn't anyone notice that the acting is absolutely ATROCIOUS?? I understand it must have been nearly impossible to act this script with any kind of realism at all but I just couldn't get past the monotone, unnatural, unrealistic way of speaking exibited by each of these characters. (I must fault the director here since each and every character has this blahhh  way of talking, it's obvious they were all told to perform the characters this way). Now, getting to the dialogue,  I don't care what century you're living in, NOBODY, NOT NOBODY, speaks casual conversation the way the dialogue is scripted in this one, not even going back to medieval times. The dialogue is so forced, so phony, so contrived, it is almost hard to listen to without chuckling. (The oh-so-great line and delivery of ""the young man...is not aware...of your...intentions..."") or some such garbage that sticks out in my mind as one of many times that I laughed outloud at the horrid writing and acting. And finally, the main character Ivy is scary to look at as her corpse-white face and vacant, dead eyes menace the screen while attempting to have the audience actually like her. Like her? I couldn't wait to see her filleted in the woods out of pure disgust at her lousy acting and blank, mannequin-inspired face. This could have been a good movie because the concept is very interesting but even if people really did decide to live a ""simpler life"" it would never require them to adopt quasi-Shakespearean speech. Does thou not agree?

860012,AU2V2ZKMZFNY6,B00064LJVE,"JR Corry ""Jenny""","[2, 8]","Note: If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this. (I'm giving you fair warning now, so don't complain about spoilers later). The only reason I'm mentioning the ending and the ""big secret"" is because I'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment I experienced when watching this movie.When I first walked into the theatre to see this, I couldn't have been more excited; after months of waiting, I'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time I saw it! The movie started out wonderfully: great acting, scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds, and, at times, almost unbearable suspense (that Shyamalan really knows how to scare!)The story takes place in a small town in the 1800's. At first this town seems like the perfect place to live: the people are friendly, the houses are cozy, and the scenery is beautiful. Despite the peaceful setting, however, we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community, something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from  being completely at ease. Every now and then, they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village; nobody ever ventures into it, and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it.Pretty soon, we find out why: according to the village elders, there are dangerous, hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain. These creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village (it attracts them). For years, the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding: as long as the villagers stay out of the forest, the monsters will not harm them. At one point,however, one of the creatures enters the village at night, leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack. While all this is happening, we (the audience) still don't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are.It was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end: There are NO MONSTERS IN THE WOODS. When one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words ""It's all a farce"", I still couldn't believe what I was hearing; it was all I could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre! After months of anticipating this film, of expecting a truly scary thriller, and of trying to guess what the monsters really are, THERE ARE NO MONSTERS! Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe it.It got worse, though. The next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the ""monsters"". The villagers aren't really living in the 1840's; they're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve. Supposedly, the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people, but when tragedy struck their families, they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new (if extremely delusional) life. The story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth. They even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real! When the retarded boy died in the woods (still wearing the stupid costume), the leaders, rather than mourning him, remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures.I basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them. What parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that? I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a movie before; not only was it completely misleading, but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were selfish and utterly pathetic (I have no other words for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it).Many fans of this movie have said that those of us who didn't like it ""don't get it"". I assure you, I did get it, and I didn't like it anyway. I'm no fan of slasher films and I didn't expect this to be one, but I also don't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters. The two stars are for the cast and the filming.

Much of the first half is rather suspenseful, but after the twist midway through the movie, you aren't nearly as scared by stuff.  It's kind of hard to explain it without giving anything away, so I'll just leave it at that.Performances were pretty good.  Ron Howard's daughter did a darn good job playing a blind girl.  Adrien Brody did a good job playing the village idiot, a quirky turn after his Oscar.

860015,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00064LJVE,kaduzy,"[2, 3]","After every M. Night Shyamalan picture since ""Unbreakable"", I always make the same vow: to never, ever pay to see another one of his movies in theaters.  But somehow, I always find myself back in the theater, waiting to be amazed again, like I was for ""The Sixth Sense.""  It's the trailers!!  Most trailers are so awful these days, filled with choppy editing and the same songs that seeing a *good* trailer is a breath of fresh air.  The trailer for ""The Village"" pulled me in with its unspoken promise of resolving the conflict between the ""creatures"" who inhabit the woods surrounding a remote 18th century village, and the villagers themselves, who have a tacit agreement not to enter the woods, as long as the creatures do not enter their village.  In the trailer, this agreement is introduced to the audience, and then we get to watch as it is abruptly breached, with red marks slashed across the doors of their homes, and frightened villagers heading for their cellers with cries of ""Don't let them in!""  After seeing the trailer, I was dying to know A) What the creatures were, B) How a bunch of 18th century people planned to fight them back into the woods & C) What will the inevitable Shyamalan twist be?After viewing the movie, I dicovered that the ""inevitable Shyamalan twist"" can be safely described as the ""inevitable Shyamalan letdown.""  His biggest mistake was showing us the creatures halfway through the movie.  The tension created by wondering what the creatures are is gone, and the rest of the film's tension is the result of clever directorial tricks.  Besides that, anyone can figure out what one aspect of the ""twist"" will be just by looking at the ""creature.""  Figuring out the other aspect isn't too difficult either, and I found myself predicting the ending, which really detroyed the experience of watching it.  (Don't worry, I have no plans of destroying anyone else's, so there won't be anymore said about the ""twist."")It's regrettable, however, that Shyamalan's twist endings have become more of a handicap than anything else.  Most people think a twist is very clever, but as a film major and screenwriter, I can assure you that it's often just a cop-out for the writer, because it keeps him/her from having to fully resolve the conflicts that were introduced in the script.  The ultimate twist ending is ""The Wizard of Oz,"" with its ""it was all a dream"" wrap-up.  Well great.  If it's a dream, then why did it matter?  What was the point of watching it?  ""The Wizard of Oz,"" however was worth watching for its enchanting story line, its remarkable musical numbers and its enduring quality.  ""The Village"" has none of these things.  Maybe some musical numbers would have livened it up!  Along with everything else that's wrong with it, I have to say that this was honestly the dullest, slowest movie Shyamalan has made.I think Shyamalan is a filmmaker who made a big, splashy debut with the masterpiece that is ""The Sixth Sense"" and since then, he has been unable to measure up to that.  And perhaps it's not fair that we expect him to . . . but we certainly should have expected better than this, and for $8.50 a ticket, we should have received it.Notes on the DVD: there's no commentary and not very many extras, so a ""special edition"" is inevitable.

Don't get me wrong, you're guaranteed to jump more than once and there is a handful of tense moments, but the truth of the movie is where the purpose lies. The movie is about the simplicities of life and the human emotions that come with it. If you think about it there is an extended metaphor within the movie. These people are almost governed by the creatures of the woods. Because of these creatures, boundries are set, limitations to their way of life are set, and there is the constant fear of death if someone were to break these set ways. Coming back to human nature, Shyamalan really only explores two human emotions; life and love. There is also the mild exploration of fear and death, and how by fearing death it forces us to enjoy life and love, but I'm getting way too into it here. The only downside of the movie is actually the ending, but it's funny because the ending is also the key to the movie. But how can the movie be good if the ending is bad? Simply put, the ending works. It really does. The thing about the ending is that the ending itself lowers the credibility of the movie by being a little too absurd. You can expect the Shyamalan Formula here, he'll throw all the answers at you first and then present you with the questions and then hit you with the final thing that makes it work. This is where people start becoming dissapointed because its not something huge like The Sixth Sense or Signs, but something subtle and meaningful in a real way, not fictional.ACTING: There are no aging action stars in this movie, but there are some veteran actors and a newcomer who all pull it off quite nicely. The big names here are William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Joaquin Pheonix. Adrien Brody has his 2nd major role since The Pianist playing a mentally challenged resident of the village. The fresh new face here is Academy Award Winner Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard. She makes a very smooth transition into the acting world and you'd think that she's been acting for a while when this is her first major role. There really is no main character here and you feel that, no one actor has a noticeably large amount of screen time and that works. Mel and Bruce were the stars of the previous entries in Shyamalan's filmography, but even with the big names everyone is treated equally here. This will make more sense once you see the ending.BOTTOM LINE: People expecting another thriller will be dissapointed, instead try a new flavor. Enjoy this meaningful poetic film for what its really meant for, not for suspense or scares but for exploring the one thing that confuses us the most. . . ourselves.",4,A More Poetic & Literary Side of Shyamalan,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,3051,"['MOVIE', 'Boy', 'oh', 'boy', 'hard', 'writing', 'review', 'movie', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', 'will', 'ruin', 'audience', 'Let', 'start', 'off', 'DO', 'NOT', 'GO', 'INTO', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'EXPECTING', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'OR', 'SIGNS', 'do', 'will', 'guarantee', 'dissapointment', 'movie', 'different', 'side', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'more', 'poetic', 'literary', 'side', 'rather', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'side', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'re"", 'guaranteed', 'jump', 'more', 'once', 'handful', 'tense', 'moments', 'truth', 'movie', 'where', 'purpose', 'movie', 'simplicities', 'life', 'human', 'emotions', 'come', 'think', 'extended', 'metaphor', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'almost', 'governed', 'creatures', 'woods', 'creatures', 'boundries', 'are', 'set', 'limitations', 'way', 'life', 'are', 'set', 'constant', 'fear', 'death', 'someone', 'were', 'break', 'set', 'ways', 'Coming', 'back', 'human', 'nature', 'Shyamalan', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'human', 'emotions', 'life', 'love', 'also', 'mild', 'exploration', 'fear', 'death', 'how', 'fearing', 'death', 'enjoy', 'life', 'love', ""'m"", 'getting', 'way', 'too', 'here', 'only', 'downside', 'movie', 'actually', 'ending', 'funny', 'ending', 'also', 'key', 'movie', 'how', 'can', 'movie', 'be', 'good', 'ending', 'bad', 'Simply', 'put', 'ending', 'works', 'really', 'thing', 'ending', 'ending', 'credibility', 'movie', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'absurd', 'can', 'expect', 'Shyamalan', 'Formula', 'here', ""'ll"", 'throw', 'answers', 'first', 'then', 'present', 'questions', 'then', 'hit', 'final', 'thing', 'work', 'where', 'people', 'start', 'becoming', 'dissapointed', 'not', 'something', 'huge', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs', 'something', 'subtle', 'meaningful', 'real', 'way', 'not', 'fictional.ACTING', 'are', 'aging', 'action', 'stars', 'movie', 'are', 'veteran', 'actors', 'newcomer', 'who', 'pull', 'off', 'quite', 'nicely', 'big', 'names', 'here', 'are', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Joaquin', 'Pheonix', 'Adrien', 'Brody', '2nd', 'major', 'role', 'Pianist', 'playing', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'resident', 'village', 'fresh', 'new', 'face', 'here', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winner', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'daughter', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'very', 'smooth', 'transition', 'acting', 'world', ""'d"", 'think', 'been', 'acting', 'while', 'when', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'really', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'feel', 'one', 'actor', 'noticeably', 'large', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'Mel', 'Bruce', 'were', 'stars', 'previous', 'entries', 'Shyamalan', 'filmography', 'even', 'big', 'names', 'everyone', 'treated', 'equally', 'here', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'see', 'ending.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'People', 'expecting', 'thriller', 'will', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'instead', 'try', 'new', 'flavor', 'Enjoy', 'meaningful', 'poetic', 'film', 'what', 'really', 'meant', 'not', 'suspense', 'scares', 'exploring', 'one', 'thing', 'most']",N/A

While I do agree with the fact that I felt the previews mislead, I think I liked the movie better knowing that there really weren't any creatures if you will.The movie is set in the 1890's in a small Pennsylvania town where a group of people have lived peacefully away from civilization. The viewer is constantly reminded by many of the elders (the village's government system if you will)of the violence and greed of the city outside of their little establishment.The movie was touted with Joaquin Phoenix as the star, but the real gem of the movie was Bryce Dallas Howard who I felt gave the best performance of the movie. Some may say that Adrien Brody's talents were a waste in this movie, but his mentally challenged character was the one that broke my heart in the end.I also loved the bond between Phoenix and Howard's characters. I think a lot of movies build up this great big tension when it comes to love between two characters, but Shyamalan's is a gentle one that is just as, if not more powerful.Upon realizing that the creatures didn't really exist, I'll admit, ticked me off a bit. But still, the real twist to me was at the end. I think the movies symbolism of trying to leave a world of violence behind in place of a simple, but peaceful existence was excellent, but as the plot proved, violence still found its way into the community.This movie also had excellent political hints in it too as to where the elders used the woods and the &quot;creatures&quot; as a way to have the people submit to obedience out of fear. I couldn't help but bring the analysis in with the current politics of the world.One of the things that I love about Shyamalan's work is the fact that he can take a subject that can so easily become complicated, add a human element to it, and make it seem so simple. I may have gotten a lot more out of this than some 15 year old who was/is expecting a hideous creature, but I think it is one of his best works.",4,A Symbolic Work,1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,1970,"['Herein', 'spoilers', 'do', 'agree', 'fact', 'felt', 'previews', 'mislead', 'think', 'liked', 'movie', 'better', 'knowing', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'creatures', 'will.The', 'movie', 'set', '1890', 'small', 'Pennsylvania', 'town', 'where', 'group', 'people', 'have', 'lived', 'peacefully', 'away', 'civilization', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'many', 'elders', 'village', 'government', 'system', 'will', 'violence', 'greed', 'city', 'little', 'establishment.The', 'movie', 'was', 'touted', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'star', 'real', 'gem', 'movie', 'was', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'who', 'felt', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'movie', 'may', 'say', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'talents', 'were', 'waste', 'movie', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'broke', 'heart', 'end.I', 'also', 'loved', 'bond', 'Phoenix', 'Howard', 'characters', 'think', 'lot', 'movies', 'build', 'up', 'great', 'big', 'tension', 'when', 'love', 'two', 'characters', 'Shyamalan', 'gentle', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'not', 'more', 'powerful.Upon', 'realizing', 'creatures', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'ticked', 'off', 'bit', 'still', 'real', 'twist', 'was', 'end', 'think', 'movies', 'symbolism', 'trying', 'leave', 'world', 'violence', 'place', 'simple', 'peaceful', 'existence', 'was', 'excellent', 'plot', 'proved', 'violence', 'still', 'found', 'way', 'community.This', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'excellent', 'political', 'hints', 'too', 'where', 'elders', 'used', 'woods', 'quot', 'creatures', 'quot', 'way', 'have', 'people', 'submit', 'obedience', 'fear', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'bring', 'analysis', 'current', 'politics', 'world.One', 'things', 'love', 'Shyamalan', 'work', 'fact', 'can', 'take', 'subject', 'can', 'so', 'easily', 'become', 'complicated', 'add', 'human', 'element', 'make', 'seem', 'so', 'simple', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'lot', 'more', '15', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'was/is', 'expecting', 'hideous', 'creature', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'works']",N/A

Not that you couldn't see the twist coming a mile away, perhaps within the first ten minute of the movie.

860025,AWM5W0MZYXF29,B00064LJVE,Kevin O'Conner,"[5, 7]","The Village is the second M. Night Shyamalan film that I've seen. Having never wanted to watch The Sixth Sense again since the obvious ""duh!"" plot twist at its end (for the record, I did not suss it out before it was revealed), I have passed on seeing any of his subsequent efforts.That changed with The Village, which had an intriguing trailer. This movie I was actually looking forward to seeing.So, the wife and I sit down last weekend to watch the DVD. And it starts out pretty good. The setting appears to be an American village in the late 1890s, though that can only be inferred from the setting, and from tombstone at the funeral that is taking place as the movie opens.The story seems to blend two overlapping plotlines. The first is a long-standing truce between the villagers and ""those we do not speak of"" that is mainly conditioned on the villagers not going into the woods where the unnamed creatures live; the second is a love story involving a boy who wants permission to go to ""the towns"" to retrieve medicines and the blind daughter of one of the village elders.This being an M. Night Shyamalan picture, there is a plot twist. And this one I saw coming (sort of) ten miles away, thanks to odd references by the adult characters to the locked black boxes in their homes, and to the reason why their siblings were not living in the village.When this plot twist is revealed, it is difficult to feel anything but cheated at such cheap storytelling. In that instant, my feelings towards the characters in the story and their situation changed from compassion to pity and contempt.

860026,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00064LJVE,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","""The Village"" is the latest heaping helping of creepiness served up by M. Night Shyamalan.  There are plenty of twists and turns(as expected), and an excellent ending, but the guts of this story run a little thin.I won't spoil this story for anyone by saying what will happen, but I offer a brief synopsis of what's going on in the film.  A small village of people are living in an area surrounded by Covington Woods.  As long as they do not cross into the woods, the creatures that live there will leave them alone.  However, cross the torch-lined barrier into the forest and the red-cloaked baddies come after you with revenge on their minds.  When a situation arises needing urgent medical care, one person decides to cross into the unknown to seek out help.  What follows is classic Shyamalan, full of confusing twists and surprising turns.I really enjoyed this film, but I felt like Shyamalan gave up too many clues early in the movie.  He neatly blurred the viewers concept of what was happening in ""The Village"" with a couple of fun twists late in the movie, but by that time I already had a pretty good idea of what was really going on.  I will say that the ending was somewhat expected from the get-go, but this was still an enjoyable film to watch.As far as suspense is concerned, Shyamalan has perfected the art of making the viewer ""peek around the door.""  You notice this in all of his films.  When you hear a noise or see a flicker in the corner of your eye, you immediately begin to try and look around the corner, door, etc., as if you were part of the movie.  This is one of the best aspects of all of M. Night's films and has become a lost art in modern cinema as far as I'm concerned.  He has also mastered the creepy factor of true horror films.  He'd rather make you think about the ""monster"" or ""alien"" instead of see it.  ""The Village"" is a good representation of both of these techniques.  M. Night has also got the ""well, I'll be"" aspect down pat.  When you finally realize what is going on, you want to kick yourself because the truth has been staring at you on the screen all along.The acting in this film is brilliant.  Joaquin Phoenix does a great job in this movie, perhaps better than his performance in ""Signs.""  Bryce Dallas Howard is the best performer in this flick.  She is both beautiful and graceful and has a solid grasp on her character.  Adrien Brody is convincing as the village simpleton, and you feel quite a bit of pain for his character.  The rest of the cast, including William Hurt, does a wonderful job.Granted, this film is a little sluggish.  It moves at a pace somewhat slower than ""Signs"" and seems to need a kick to get it moving once in awhile.  Other than that, the film is fun to watch.  There are some really creepy moments in store for the viewer, and they are pulled off in a way that made me quite uncomfortable for a good portion of the film.As always, M. Night throws in one of his old home movies to ""terrorize"" the audience in the extras(I never was really fond of German Shepherds).  There are also production photos, ""Bryce's Diary,"" and plenty of other fun extras for folks who dig that kind of stuff.In closing, if you enjoyed ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" I'm sure you'll find this movie satisfying.  If ""Unbreakable"" is your favorite M. Night Shyamalan flick, you may want to skip this one.Highly recommended to fans of Shyamalan and those who like their movies with more intelligence and less whiz-bang effects.",4,"Twisty, But Not As Good As Shyamalan's Other Flicks",1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,3484,"['Village', 'latest', 'heaping', 'helping', 'creepiness', 'served', 'up', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'are', 'plenty', 'twists', 'turns', 'expected', 'excellent', 'ending', 'guts', 'story', 'run', 'little', 'thin.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'story', 'anyone', 'saying', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'offer', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'small', 'village', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'area', 'surrounded', 'Covington', 'Woods', 'As', 'long', 'do', 'not', 'cross', 'woods', 'creatures', 'live', 'will', 'leave', 'alone', 'However', 'cross', 'torch-lined', 'barrier', 'forest', 'red-cloaked', 'baddies', 'come', 'revenge', 'minds', 'When', 'situation', 'needing', 'urgent', 'medical', 'care', 'one', 'person', 'cross', 'unknown', 'seek', 'out', 'help', 'What', 'classic', 'Shyamalan', 'full', 'confusing', 'twists', 'surprising', 'turns.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'felt', 'Shyamalan', 'gave', 'up', 'too', 'many', 'clues', 'early', 'movie', 'neatly', 'blurred', 'viewers', 'concept', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Village', 'couple', 'fun', 'twists', 'late', 'movie', 'time', 'already', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'will', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'somewhat', 'expected', 'get-go', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watch.As', 'far', 'suspense', 'concerned', 'Shyamalan', 'perfected', 'art', 'making', 'viewer', 'peek', 'door', 'notice', 'films', 'When', 'hear', 'noise', 'see', 'flicker', 'corner', 'eye', 'immediately', 'begin', 'try', 'look', 'corner', 'door', 'etc.', 'were', 'part', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'aspects', 'M.', 'Night', 'films', 'become', 'lost', 'art', 'modern', 'cinema', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'also', 'mastered', 'creepy', 'factor', 'true', 'horror', 'films', ""'d"", 'rather', 'make', 'think', 'monster', 'alien', 'instead', 'see', 'Village', 'good', 'representation', 'techniques', 'M.', 'Night', 'also', 'got', 'well', ""'ll"", 'be', 'aspect', 'down', 'pat', 'When', 'finally', 'realize', 'what', 'going', 'want', 'kick', 'truth', 'been', 'staring', 'screen', 'along.The', 'acting', 'film', 'brilliant', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'better', 'performance', 'Signs', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'best', 'performer', 'flick', 'beautiful', 'graceful', 'solid', 'grasp', 'character', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'convincing', 'village', 'simpleton', 'feel', 'quite', 'bit', 'pain', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'William', 'Hurt', 'wonderful', 'job.Granted', 'film', 'little', 'sluggish', 'pace', 'somewhat', 'slower', 'Signs', 'need', 'kick', 'get', 'moving', 'once', 'awhile', 'Other', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'really', 'creepy', 'moments', 'store', 'viewer', 'are', 'pulled', 'off', 'way', 'made', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'good', 'portion', 'film.As', 'always', 'M.', 'Night', 'one', 'old', 'home', 'movies', 'terrorize', 'audience', 'extras', 'never', 'was', 'really', 'fond', 'German', 'Shepherds', 'are', 'also', 'production', 'photos', 'Bryce', 'Diary', 'plenty', 'other', 'fun', 'extras', 'folks', 'who', 'dig', 'kind', 'stuff.In', 'closing', 'enjoyed', 'Signs', 'Sixth', 'Sense', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'Unbreakable', 'favorite', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'flick', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'one.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'like', 'movies', 'more', 'intelligence', 'less', 'whiz-bang', 'effects']",N/A

I have no problem with the story of this film.  I have no problem with the twist ending even though it was a little dissapointing.  With that said here is the problem with this film.  In the trailer, or somewhere before this movie was released, the synopsis stated specifically this story takes place in the year 1897.  I was watching this with my wife and the sound effects and visuals of this film not to mention the colors were outstanding.  But about a quarter of the way through this film I realized it actually took place in modern times.  But then they actually reveal that the monsters were fake and showed the costume in that shed.  This was shown too early.  But then they go on with this great adventure into the woods when you already know there are no monsters, but you are still hoping something great will happen.  When we find out what most people had already figured out shortly into the film that the story took place in modern day we are expecting the big bang.  But it doesn't come.  You have the director's voice in the film as someone working in this military area and I am thinking ok, top secret military area:  Hey the military must be doing some secret experiments with genetically eng lifeforms to use for soldiers, which would explain the monsters in the woods, but of course this is not even the case or if it is we are not told.  All we know is that there is this secret gov't territory that we have no idea why it is there.The Bottem line the synopsis stated the film takes place in the year 1897 when it clearly didn't.  If the synopsis never would have stated this I would have few problems with this film.  And what makes it even sadder is the fact that they didn't need to put the date in the synopsis; just show the village and people would have instantly guessed this takes place in the late 19th century.Though not as bad as Cold creek manor as far as no story and nt as insulting to the audience as High Tension which didn't care about tying everything together to make sense, The Village did tie everything together but the company that released this film lied in the synopsis especially when they didn't have to.  This is unforgivable.  I would still recommend renting this movie just to see the visuals and great acting.  when it is over you can use your own imagination (something the filmakers lacked in this film) to have any kind of ending  you wish.  You can say, yeah those monsters were pretty cool, they were creatures that evolved over time from something someting and they declared war on the village and the town had to fight hundreds of them off by the end of the film showing no clear winner, but leaving room for a sequel.

860034,A185GLK2OCPEVP,B00064LJVE,K. Smith,"[2, 2]","""The Village"" is a good movie, but people keep expecting it to be a really scary movie with some sort of HUGE twist at the end. It isn't a scary movie (as the advertising seems to indicate), but it is suspenseful. There are some rather tense moments, but I would not call them scary or frightening. Neither does this movie have a big, surprising twist like ""The Sixth Sense"" (actually, that was the only movie of his that had a real big twist, yet people keep expecting it from him).Many of this film's detractors  say ""I saw the 'surprise' coming from a mile away"" or ""the 'twist' was stupid."" I think they are missing the point of the movie and are probably the same people who complained about the aliens in ""Signs."" ""Signs"" is not a movie about aliens. ""Unbreakable"" is not a movie about comic books or men with super-powers. ""The Sixth Sense"" is not just about a little boy who sees dead people.

I sat there waiting for it to get scary and it never happened! There were only two shocks throughout the entire film!

The Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable all had a many powerful and shocking scenes while this one was given the opportunity to succeed, but failed greatly.

He's drawn comparisons to Hitchcock and Spielberg - in the same sentence no less?  Resting on the laurels of exactly ONE good movie, he manages to eek out a career for himself.  Since THE SIXTH SENSE, his movies have gotten progressively worse.  UNBREAKABLE was fair at best.  An interesting idea with a dull, rumbling ride to the conclusion.  SIGNS was a very rough movie to watch.  The characters were cookie-cutter samples of human emotion and conflict - toss in a guy in an alien suit and you have what exactly?  A bad joke.  Now, THE VILLAGE...Mr. Shyamalan's ""entertainments"" are about as mediocre as you can get - and I really do wish I could enjoy his movies.  They seem to lack something.  Walking out of this one, I felt like I had just witnessed a badly executed parlor trick disguised as a vague ""social commentary"" piece.  Bryce Howard is a wonderful actress; I hope to see more of her in the future.  She takes a lifeless character and gives her depth.  The other cast members also played their parts wonderfully - too bad it wasn't another movie.  The trailer seemed creepy; a dark fairytale or ghost story set in the 19th century.  Nice idea, haven't seen one of those in a while.  I pay the eight bucks, and watched this thing unfold:THE VILLAGE had absolutely no suspense, no tension - a few cheap scares along the way - but nothing to make the ""trick"" ending worth the ride.  I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the movie, but the whole story is so flat and badly contrived, that it doesn't really matter.  The pay off was in the vein of the ""Twilight Zone"" & when it was revealed, I could almost hear the squeaky curtain and see the wizard furiously working the controls to an out-of-control smoke machine.  I'm not looking for depth or stories that cleverly draw an allegory of our world every time I go to the movies, but would like something above... this?  Pretty cinematography, composition and cheap thrills do NOT make good movies - that would be like having a handsome nose with loose teeth and no eyeballs.I read a review that stated this movie was ""smart... an intelligent thrill-ride"".

860038,A29OFQ7ZDJLCI2,B00064LJVE,Laura,"[3, 7]","I went to the theater to see this movie a bit conflicted. On one hand, I was excited because I am such a fan of most of M. Night Shyamalan's other work (&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Signs&quot;, most notably). However, the premise seemed a bit overdone--after all, there have been other stories written about small villages being haunted by some sort of creature from surrounding woods.What I saw when I got to the theater was exceptionally disappointing, though. For one thing, the characters were so poorly developed that: 1, I had a whole lot of trouble keeping track of who everyone was and how they all related to each other; and 2, I felt very little emotion towards any of the townspeople, even during their most tense situations.Secondly, and most importantly, I think, was the dreadfully poor storyline. The &quot;twist&quot; of an ending was not only cliche but extremely predictable. When it comes down to it, even if I were to spoil the ending and explain the entire movie (as I've done before with others), it would seem so patently absurd that you would probably not believe me.The only good point I can think of is the fact that there were some tense moments that made me jump. Other than that, I see no redeeming qualities.Overall, this was a very poorly done work.

860039,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00064LJVE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[268, 305]","There is so much bad word of mouth out there about &quot;The Village&quot; that I had to go see it by myself because nobody wanted to see it with me. I avoided all the publicity about M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film so that I could make up my own mind. Besides, if the whole point is to see whether he can fool us again, why would you want to know anything on the chance that it would be too much? If the film gets spoiled by a review, then that is hardly giving the film a chance. Even when Penn & Teller show you how they do their trick, they get to do the trick first.The Village is located in a valley surrounding by Covington Woods. The year is 1897 according to the tombstone we see at the start of the film. As we are introduced to life in the community we learn about the strange rules under which its inhabitants live. If you did not read the rules on the poster for &quot;The Village,&quot; they are enacted during the first part of the film. Red is a bad color that cannot be seen because it attracts them, while mustard yellow is a color of safety. No one can enter the woods because that is where those of whom no one speaks will get you. If the warning bell is sounded, then head for the cellars in your houses immediately because they are coming.A council of elders run the village, and their leader is clearly Edward Walker (William Hurt). They set the tone for the village, but in the wake of the death of a young child because of sickness, young Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to leave the village, travel through the forbidden woods, and bring back medicine from one of the towns on the other side. Lucius is uncommonly brave. The young boys test their courage by standing on a stump on the border between the village and the woods, and Lucius is the record holder. But his courage could doom the Village by breaking the truce that has held between the two sides for many years.Most of that you can pick up from the trailers for &quot;The Village.&quot; Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius is clearly the hero of the film and you know know that there is no reason to set up these rules if they are not going to get violated as a major plot development in the film. Beyond that it is difficult to say anything that would not interfer with your chance to enjoy the film on its own terms. However, there are two things I can say.First, given that he has backed himself in a corner it terms of always having to come up with some big secret twist for all of his films, Shyamalan does try to come up with something to meet the raised expectations. You can certainly decide afterwards that the secret was not big enough or good enough, but unless the film has been spoiled for you I cannot believe you are going to see everything that is coming. As we know from &quot;Signs&quot; and the rest of his films if there is one thing Shyamalan can do it is that everything fits together in the end.Second, as I started to get into this film I decided that the character I really liked was Ivy Walker, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. That is the one name that appears in the opening credits that I did not recognize (remember, I avoided all the publicity) and so when it turned out that Bryce was playing Ivy, and that the actress is the daughter of Ron Howard I was surprised (no wonder she looked familiar without my recognizing her). This is a breakthrough performance, which may well be the only thing that everybody who sees &quot;The Village&quot; is going to agree on.Early on in this film I decided what I wanted this film to be, not expecting that it would actually end up being that, so when it did I was both surprised and gratified. Since I never put much significance into the meaning of Shyamalan's movie twists, focusing instead on whether or not I could be fooled, &quot;The Village&quot; certainly meets the criteria. He got me. Again.",4,"Fool me four times? Not bad, M.

860044,AD2BIAIH78QI5,B00064LJVE,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[1, 6]","Okay, here's your warning: SPOILER ahead. Alright with you? Then read on:As I sat watching this film, I was unpleasantly reminded of the Bruce Willis flick, ""Unbreakable"", where the villain turned out to be the disabled freak in the wheelchair, proof evidently that crippled bodies cause crippled development, whether emotional or moral. Sure enough, I go home and see what else the filmmaker for ""The Village"" had done, and up pops ""Unbreakable"". Perhaps if I were to see a third film by M. Night I would find a similar strand again, but I'm going to do my darndest to avoid seeing such a third film by this person, who seems to want to make this point over again.""The Village"" is a little like the town of Walnut Grove in ""Little House on the Prairie""--gingham and such. What's a bit different from the norm is that this Village has a mandate against a few things, like wearing red or going outside the set boundaries. This is to avoid meeting up with a creepy force surrounding the Village. Basically, the plot concerns how the rising generation feel steps should be taken to venture into that no-man's land to make contact with the outside world for health supplies, etc. Much as you might expect, things turn dangerous before The Surprise Climax of the film occurs.Good points? Yes, the film has good atmosphere and great cinematography, which many of the reviewers note. Good performances by ""elders"" William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.Bad points? Besides what I mentioned up front about demonizing the disabled character in the film, another thing that stretched belief was making Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brophy of the ""Young'uns"" generation. Okay, they're not as old as the hills or anything, but c'mon, they're not teenagers either. Jake Gyllenhaal would have been better casting for the Joaquin character, for instance.While I could see The Surprise Climax coming, others of my acquaintance maintain they were astounded at the development. Just depends on how much you read or seen about ""isolated societies"" themes.To sum up, it's discouraging to see how a movie like ""The Village"" takes us all back not just a few steps but several centuries in attitudes about the disabled and ""blame"" for bad events. Hopefully, these old prejudices won't creep into the subconcious minds of young people viewing something like this.",2,More sublimal messages about the disabled,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,2331,"['Okay', 'here', 'warning', 'SPOILER', 'ahead', 'Alright', 'Then', 'read', 'sat', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'unpleasantly', 'reminded', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'flick', 'Unbreakable', 'where', 'villain', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'disabled', 'freak', 'wheelchair', 'proof', 'evidently', 'crippled', 'bodies', 'cause', 'crippled', 'development', 'emotional', 'moral', 'Sure', 'enough', 'go', 'home', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'filmmaker', 'Village', 'had', 'done', 'up', 'pops', 'Unbreakable', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'see', 'third', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', 'would', 'find', 'similar', 'strand', 'again', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'darndest', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'such', 'third', 'film', 'person', 'who', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'over', 'again', 'Village', 'little', 'town', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'gingham', 'such', 'What', 'bit', 'different', 'norm', 'Village', 'mandate', 'few', 'things', 'wearing', 'red', 'going', 'set', 'boundaries', 'avoid', 'meeting', 'up', 'creepy', 'force', 'surrounding', 'Village', 'Basically', 'plot', 'how', 'rising', 'generation', 'feel', 'steps', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'venture', 'no-man', 'land', 'make', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'health', 'supplies', 'etc', 'Much', 'might', 'expect', 'things', 'turn', 'dangerous', 'Surprise', 'Climax', 'film', 'occurs.Good', 'points', 'Yes', 'film', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'cinematography', 'many', 'reviewers', 'note', 'Good', 'performances', 'elders', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver.Bad', 'points', 'what', 'mentioned', 'up', 'front', 'demonizing', 'disabled', 'character', 'film', 'thing', 'stretched', 'belief', 'was', 'making', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Adrien', 'Brophy', ""Young'uns"", 'generation', 'Okay', ""'re"", 'not', 'as', 'old', 'hills', 'anything', ""c'mon"", ""'re"", 'not', 'teenagers', 'either', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'casting', 'Joaquin', 'character', 'instance.While', 'could', 'see', 'Surprise', 'Climax', 'coming', 'others', 'acquaintance', 'maintain', 'were', 'astounded', 'development', 'Just', 'how', 'much', 'read', 'seen', 'isolated', 'societies', 'themes.To', 'sum', 'up', 'discouraging', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'Village', 'back', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'steps', 'several', 'centuries', 'attitudes', 'disabled', 'blame', 'bad', 'events', 'Hopefully', 'old', 'prejudices', 'wo', ""n't"", 'creep', 'subconcious', 'minds', 'young', 'people', 'viewing', 'something']",N/A
860045,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B00064LJVE,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[4, 7]","NOTE:  Revised and edited for quality assurance WEDS 1/23/13I know people whom actually enjoyed this besides me, even though the majority hate it.  As far as M. Night Shamalan goes, besides Sixth Sense, this is his most  emotionally invested film, the emotional ties in this run run just as deep as they do in ""The Sixth Sense"", but relies a lot less on suspense as it is more of a love story.  While there are still plenty of jumpy moments, it's more about the characters journey and why things are the way they are.The large part of the reason people seemed to dismiss this film so much when it was originally released was because it was slow-moving, and slow to reveal itself.  While this perfectly suit the time period the movie is set in, it isn't something modern movie goers are fond of, especially when other Shamalyan films up to that point, while slow, were filled with more general suspense to keep you satiated during the long periods of dialogue.  This film is all about the journey, and every time I watch it I still have that sense of wonder the first time I watched the movie, ""What is going on in this village?""The acting is all top-notch, especially Bryce Dallace Howard, and this was her first major role as a leading actress and it shows why this was the that broke her in to the mainstream, she is simply amazing as the blind girl Ivy.  Joaquin Phoenix, before jumping off the deep end and making his mocumentary, is equally fantastic as Lucius.  William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody are all fantastic.  There is not a weak actor in the bunch.Even if you watch this movie and still hate it, the one thing that stands out more than any of the actors, set pieces, or plot devises is the beautiful and enchanting score with the Hilary Hahn's amazing violin playing at the forefront.  I still listen to the soundrack to this day, and I will most likely until the day I die.  There is a reason it was nominated for best score, it is exquisite and really elevates the movie overall.Shamalyan, if I remember correctly, asserted he used an original twilight episode as inspiration for this film, and I can definitely see that.  Though some have also claimed he plagiarized their ideas for the film, I have not read the source materialRunning Out of Timeso I cannot comment on it.  Regardless of what inspired the film however, it is a beautiful and haunting film with a slow pace that reveals itself and its intentions slowly.  It may not be for everyone, but for those who enjoy more of an old-fashioned love/suspense story, you may find it quite enjoyable.God Bless ~Amy",5,A Slow Burn of a Movie..,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,2597,"['NOTE', 'Revised', 'edited', 'quality', 'assurance', 'WEDS', '1/23/13I', 'know', 'people', 'whom', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'majority', 'hate', 'As', 'far', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'most', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'film', 'emotional', 'ties', 'run', 'run', 'just', 'as', 'deep', 'do', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'lot', 'less', 'suspense', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'jumpy', 'moments', 'more', 'characters', 'journey', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'are.The', 'large', 'part', 'reason', 'people', 'seemed', 'dismiss', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'was', 'was', 'slow-moving', 'slow', 'reveal', 'perfectly', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'set', ""n't"", 'something', 'modern', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', 'fond', 'especially', 'when', 'other', 'Shamalyan', 'films', 'up', 'point', 'slow', 'were', 'filled', 'more', 'general', 'suspense', 'keep', 'satiated', 'long', 'periods', 'dialogue', 'film', 'journey', 'time', 'watch', 'still', 'have', 'sense', 'wonder', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'What', 'going', 'village', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'Bryce', 'Dallace', 'Howard', 'was', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'leading', 'actress', 'why', 'was', 'broke', 'mainstream', 'simply', 'amazing', 'blind', 'girl', 'Ivy', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'jumping', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'making', 'mocumentary', 'equally', 'fantastic', 'Lucius', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'are', 'fantastic', 'not', 'weak', 'actor', 'bunch.Even', 'watch', 'movie', 'still', 'hate', 'one', 'thing', 'out', 'more', 'actors', 'set', 'pieces', 'plot', 'devises', 'beautiful', 'enchanting', 'score', 'Hilary', 'Hahn', 'amazing', 'violin', 'playing', 'forefront', 'still', 'listen', 'soundrack', 'day', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'day', 'die', 'reason', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'score', 'exquisite', 'really', 'movie', 'overall.Shamalyan', 'remember', 'correctly', 'asserted', 'used', 'original', 'twilight', 'episode', 'inspiration', 'film', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'have', 'also', 'claimed', 'plagiarized', 'ideas', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'source', 'materialRunning', 'Out', 'Timeso', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'Regardless', 'what', 'inspired', 'film', 'however', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'intentions', 'slowly', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'more', 'old-fashioned', 'love/suspense', 'story', 'may', 'find', 'quite', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

860048,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00064LJVE,Lleu Christopher,"[6, 10]","The Village is an overly serious, and, as a result, unintentionally funny suspense/horror tale that is really a fable. It appears that writer/director M. Night Shyamalan believes he is imparting some great wisdom here, but the slow pace, stilted dialogue and ultimately slender payoff don't carry the film very far. The story is set in a village populated by somber, Puritan-like people who live in perpetual fear of monsters who live in the surrounding forest. It is forbidden to venture outside the village and when a tragedy compels someone to travel to the outer world for medicine, the community's supposedly idyllic life is threatened. Everyone in the film speaks in a ridiculously formal pseudo-19th Century style. Not that I recall how people spoke a century ago, but I simply cannot believe anyone ever talked like this. This style might  have been effective for a parody, but here it is mainly a distraction. If this wasn't enough to make it hard to take the film seriously, the villagers also walk around at times in silly yellow, hooded robes which are supposed to repel the monsters.Aside from the dialogue, the main problem with The Village is that the basic dullness of the place detracts from what is meant to be the film's central conflict. The basic question here seems to be whether the villagers haven't paid too high a price for their secluded existence. Yet, considering how uptight and downbeat everyone is, you end up wondering why anyone would want to live there under any circumstances. The cast does the best it can with the script and implausible plot. William Hurt is one of the village ""elders"" who presides over the frightened citizens. Joaquin Phoenix is Lucius, a brave but even more somber than average young man.  Bryce Dallas Howard, as a blind girl named Ivy who is in love with Lucius, adds a spark of life to the film, though she too is limited by the script. Like Shyamalan's other (and better) films, there is a secret to The Village which is meant to shock, as well as impart an all too obvious lesson.

Night Shyamalan has found his formula and will work it in to whatever film he makes, regardless of how well it may or may not fit.  In the case of the Village, we have a beautifully recreated 19th century town, a flawless cast, and a genuinely creepy concept to work with.  It seems that with all that, adding the 'Shyamalan Twist' would be unnecessary; and it was!  Shyamalan is a truly gifted filmmaker and has created some amazing and frightening film moments, however, applying the same formula for the fourth time seems to reveal a level of insecurtiy or fear, that an artist of his calibre should have outgrown by now.  For those who have seen the film, imagine what this film would have been if the monsters were real!  It would have forced Shyamalan to NOT add the twist at the end, because there would have been no reason to! But it seems that he wanted the suprise ending there at all costs, and in this case, it cost him the chance to finally break the mold and mature as an artist.  In his previous films, the twist was essential to the story, it made everything make sense.  In the Village, the story is essential to the twist, it just feels forced.  All and all there are some really creepy moments and some really good performances; but these seem somewhat wasted on a film that could have been so much more than a rehash of the same old formula.

860058,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00064LJVE,"Maine Writer ""David""","[11, 16]","I liked The Village. It was a huge improvement over Signs, but certainly not in the same class as The Sixth Sense. And, yes, M. Night Shyamalan will forever work in the shadow of his stunningly tight and coherent &quot;ghost&quot; story.The Sixth Sense wasn't really about ghosts at all, nor is the The Village about carnivorous creatures that lurk in the woods. Sure, there are very real ghosts in The Sixth Sense, as there certainly are scary monsters in Covington Woods. (Of course, I won't spoil it for those who have yet to visit The Village--are the monsters &quot;real&quot; or not is a debate that rages on the Web, even after people have seen the film. You need to answer that question for yourself!)Don't be misled by reviews that suggest parallels between this movie and President Bush or the war on terror--there really aren't. (The only analogy, I suppose, is that we, like the Villagers are gripped with fear of &quot;monsters&quot;--in our case, terrorists. But, watch the movie and you'll see any further similarities dissolve as the story unfolds.)So, then, what is The Village about? It's a look into the heart of darkness, so to speak. The Village is about idealism, about taking life into your own hands and trying to crush grief, tragedy, and evil. And while there may be all manner of dangerous creatures in Covington Woods, there are also creatures in ourselves--Monsters of the Id. Exactly how far do you need to run, how isolated do you have to be, to avoid those kinds of monsters? In the end, The Village does a nice job giving us an answer.Why just three stars? In part, because Shyamalan's storytelling approach--telling the story from the view of average villagers and not the Elders--keeps us from probing deeply and fully its core theme. It's storytelling at the expense of drama and deep, passionate inquiry. If the movie had told us more about why the Village was formed at the outset--it really is, after all, no surprise--I think it would have been a bigger, more satisfying film.And when you're done, ask, &quot;Would I live in The Village?

Night Shyamalan's masterpiece. Only ""The Sixth Sense"" equals the experience he creates here.While smarmy internet spoil-sports and jaded, cynical critics found much to fault in the film, anyone who goes into it with an open mind will be dazzled. Don't look for the plot twists (though they are present), don't expect the big surprise (though you may be surprised), just let down your defenses and be drawn in.Despite my love for (and familiarity with) Shyamalan's other films, I was still amazed by ""The Village"". The cast including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent. Adrien Brody and especially Bryce Dallas Howard give top-caliber performances.Shyamalan creates a moody, atmospheric setting as he explores the life of a town seemingly encircled by dark woods which hide a horrible secret. The people of the titular village live in fear of strange creatures lurking just out of sight. They constantly worry that their fragile truce with the monstrous beings will be broken. But things are not what they seem in Covington Woods - or are they?M. Night Shyamalan and Touchstone Pictures spared no expense when it came to the DVD packaging of ""The Village"".

UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS were overhyped garbage, and THE VILLAGE just might be the worst of the lot. Yup folks, THE VILLAGE is another in a string of disappointing Shyamalan flops. ""What was he thinking?"" you ask. We may never know, but perhaps the color green has alot to do with it, as his Sci-Fi special proved. You know the one--the special Shymalan was supposedly trying to keep off the air because they had lots of dirt on him and his past life, when in fact, he was in on the scam the whole time. Perhaps even Shymalan had no faith in THE VILLAGE and needed the publicity for a strong opening weekend. He got it, but I have a feeling next weekend won't fare so well.With UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, Shymalan created a good story and interesting characters before ruining the films with absurd endings. (In SIGNS, I think the cheesy alien costumes ruined it for me.) Unlike UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS however, THE VILLAGE didn't even start off well, as promising as the story seemed. I rolled my eyes at the dialogue and mediocre acting from the very first frame. I thought, and hoped, the film might get better as it progressed, but it got worse. MUCH MUCH worse. When the monster made its first appearance, I began to lose hope. I don't think I've sighed so loudly or checked my watch so often during a movie. THE VILLAGE was slow moving, boring, cheesy, and ultimately pointless.Most of all though, THE VILLAGE fails because the story fails to connect with it's characters and subsequently it's audience. The film seems to be floating around in some weird fantasy world where it's a good idea to send blind people stumbling around helplessly in the forest. Nothing about the story made sense to me, not the characters, not the situations they are presented in, nor the idiotic, nonsensical, and utterly predictable twists. I was most dissapointed because I couldn't believe Shymalan could have assembled such a great cast for what is undoubtedly a terrible script. The fact that he went so far as to put them all through boot camp to learn and live like they are in the 1800's (the extensive prep was why Kirsten Dunst had to drop out) was very pointless considering where the film eventually led.I'm not going to lambaste THE VILLAGE for being predictable though. That's too easy and often Shyamalan haters get so caught up in his movie's twists that they miss the bigger picture. The twist doesn't matter if the journey is compelling. In THE VILLAGE, it just isn't Nothing about it is. Night presents generally static characters who end the film much as they began. He just doesn't have anywhere to take us, and it unfortunately takes forever to get there.Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter) proves surprisingly charming even though the somewhat stunted dialogue she's given doesn't leave a lot to work with. She, along with the rest of the cast, who, except for Adrien Brody, aren't very good, is one of the few only redeeming quality in this ludicrous film. For a movie being touted as suspense, THE VILLAGE isn't very suspenseful and for a movie with such big anticipation THE VILLAGE doesn't seem to have much to deliver. There are some effective moments, but they are FEW and far between. There are some good things about this film, but on a whole, it's just lame. For one, the cinematography, is creepy. But unfortunately, that doesn't save the film. I was expecing it to be bad, but in no way did I think it would be THIS bad. I'm dumbfounded that anyone actually liked this!As an added note, I would like to say that the story and ""twist"" for this film are VERY similar to that in the young adult novel, Running Out of Time, by Margaret Peterson Haddix. Don't believe me? For those who've seen the film, PLEASE check the summary of the book on Amazon. Did Shymalan plagiarize?

Many people do not understand this film (from what I can tell about the other reviews.)  It is about what fear can do to people.  Even when there are no monsters they become real when they are created in our minds.  That's where they have the most power to affect us.  Movie thrillers of the past new how to use this fact.  They didn't need to have blood splattering everywhere or to actually show a psycho beheading someone.  They (namely Alfred Hitchcok) just had to create the idea of these things happening to terrify.  That way everyone's own imagination will create their own nightmare.  I have watched this movie many times (I am as I'm writing this) and I see new things to admire about it everytime.

860070,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,B00064LJVE,Mat,"[2, 6]","(...)The problem with most thrillers is that once you've watched them one time, there is nothing left. Too many of these films spend all of their creative energy trying to give the audience a scare. The best directors of the genre create truly great films, which just happened to give the audience a scare. While M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent craftsman, he tends to be unable to elevate his films into the realms of true cinema. The Village is no exception.The story centers around a small village that seems to be set in the later part of the 1800's. The Villagers have worked out a complicated deal with strange creatures (""Those We Do Not Speak Of"") lurking in the near woods. Problems arise and the long held pact begins to break down. This causes there to be a need for one of the villagers to venture through the woods into the larger towns.The biggest problem with the Village and the last several of Shyamalan's films is his surprise endings. I read somewhere several years ago that he didn't want to be pigeonholed into doing the same supernatural type stories with twist ending. I wish he had kept to his word. Instead everyone goes into the theatre expecting, waiting on the surprise at the end. This is a distraction taken away from the whole of the film; it is a gimmick that has run thin. A truly surprising ending for the director now, would be no surprise at all.Where Shyamalan excels is his Hitchcockian use of suspense. He understands that some of the best thrills come not from something jumping straight out at the audience, but in what we don't see. It is a long time in the Village before we see ""The Things We Don't Speak Of"" and even then we only catch a glimpse. For Shyamalan understands that our imaginations are more powerful than any piece of costuming or CG effect. There were, in fact, several moments during my first viewing of the film that hand my hair standing on end. These were tense, beautifully paced moments.The film also creates a masterful sense of mood. The color scheme, set design and costuming are all top notch. They give the film a true sense of paranoia and suspense. The acting, for the most part, is quite good. Which is not surprising considering the cast is made up of the likes of William Hurt, Sigorney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrian Brody amongst others. There several interweaving human stories set amongst the supernatural tale, some of which are quite moving. Yet it is the supernatural aspect that shines brightest, and ultimately, falls flat upon subsequent viewings. Watching the film a second time, knowing the surprises, I felt a tinge of boredom. The story no longer captivated me as it did the first time. Knowing the truth, there were too many plot points, and character actions that seemed false, or self serving.It is a film worth a first viewing. Shyalaman is a true talent, and I look forward to his next film. In a sense the Village is really two stories. One is a suspenseful tale of creatures lurking in the dark, and the other of a quaint village dealing with extraordinary circumstances. I believe the fault lies with the merging of the two. The suspense doesn't hold up under subsequent viewings. It does not serve the other aspect of its story. Likewise, the more human story is broken apart too much by the mystical aspects(...)",3,Loses Points With Each Viewing,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,3318,"['problem', 'most', 'thrillers', 'once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'one', 'time', 'nothing', 'left', 'Too', 'many', 'films', 'spend', 'creative', 'energy', 'trying', 'give', 'audience', 'scare', 'best', 'directors', 'genre', 'create', 'truly', 'great', 'films', 'just', 'happened', 'give', 'audience', 'scare', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'excellent', 'craftsman', 'be', 'unable', 'elevate', 'films', 'realms', 'true', 'cinema', 'Village', 'exception.The', 'story', 'centers', 'small', 'village', 'be', 'set', 'later', 'part', '1800', 'Villagers', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'complicated', 'deal', 'strange', 'creatures', 'Do', 'Not', 'Speak', 'lurking', 'near', 'woods', 'Problems', 'arise', 'long', 'held', 'pact', 'break', 'down', 'be', 'need', 'one', 'villagers', 'venture', 'woods', 'larger', 'towns.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Village', 'last', 'several', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'surprise', 'endings', 'read', 'somewhere', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'pigeonholed', 'doing', 'same', 'supernatural', 'type', 'stories', 'twist', 'ending', 'wish', 'had', 'kept', 'word', 'Instead', 'everyone', 'theatre', 'expecting', 'waiting', 'surprise', 'end', 'distraction', 'taken', 'away', 'whole', 'film', 'gimmick', 'run', 'thin', 'truly', 'surprising', 'ending', 'director', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'surprise', 'all.Where', 'Shyamalan', 'excels', 'Hitchcockian', 'use', 'suspense', 'best', 'thrills', 'come', 'not', 'something', 'jumping', 'straight', 'out', 'audience', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'long', 'time', 'Village', 'see', 'Things', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Speak', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'Shyamalan', 'imaginations', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'piece', 'costuming', 'CG', 'effect', 'were', 'fact', 'several', 'moments', 'first', 'viewing', 'film', 'hand', 'hair', 'standing', 'end', 'were', 'tense', 'beautifully', 'paced', 'moments.The', 'film', 'also', 'masterful', 'sense', 'mood', 'color', 'scheme', 'set', 'design', 'costuming', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'give', 'film', 'true', 'sense', 'paranoia', 'suspense', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'good', 'Which', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'cast', 'made', 'likes', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigorney', 'Weaver', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'amongst', 'others', 'several', 'interweaving', 'human', 'stories', 'set', 'amongst', 'supernatural', 'tale', 'are', 'quite', 'moving', 'supernatural', 'aspect', 'brightest', 'ultimately', 'flat', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'Watching', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'knowing', 'surprises', 'felt', 'tinge', 'boredom', 'story', 'no', 'longer', 'captivated', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'Knowing', 'truth', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'points', 'character', 'actions', 'seemed', 'false', 'serving.It', 'film', 'first', 'viewing', 'Shyalaman', 'true', 'talent', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'film', 'sense', 'Village', 'really', 'two', 'stories', 'One', 'suspenseful', 'tale', 'creatures', 'lurking', 'dark', 'other', 'quaint', 'village', 'dealing', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'believe', 'fault', 'merging', 'two', 'suspense', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'not', 'serve', 'other', 'aspect', 'story', 'Likewise', 'more', 'human', 'story', 'broken', 'apart', 'too', 'much', 'mystical', 'aspects']",N/A

For one, they lack medicine and other supplies that might be available to them if there was a link to the outlying world. For another, the surrounding woods are populated by creepy humanoid creatures that are attracted to the color red and seem to be ready to kill on sight. Joaquin Phoenix is repeatedly requesting permission to go to town, after an unspecified disease kills a young boy, but he is just as frequently denied by the elders. But when he is stabbed by a mentally retarded friend in a fit of jealous anger, his blind lover is given permission to go to town and get the medicine she needs to save him. There are a series of twists at the end, with the least surprising involving a well-intentioned plot by the town elders.This was another strong outing by M.

I go to one or two movies a week, because there is nothing else to do in the small town I live in. I've seen almost 40 movies this year, and by far The Village is the most disappointing movie of the year. The movie is nothing like what it's been sold and advertised on for the last six months.The Village is supposed to take place in Covington,PA in 1897. the citizens of Covington live in a small valley surrounded by a forest. They can't leave the forest because of the beasts or &quot;They who we do not speak of&quot; live there.The Studio and M. Night Shyamalan begged the critcs not to reveal anymore of the plot than that. I can see why they wanted that for a bunch of reasons. The movie has a lot of plot twists and the story takes some major changes. If you knew about the changes you probaly wont enjoy the movie as much. Or in my case If I had known I wouldn't have wasted my money.The movie is sold as one of the scariest movies you will ever see. It's by far anything but that. That ideal really blew me off to the movie. For the last six months all we've seen in the trailers and advertising is how scary this is. I jumped once in the movie, and the crowd only reacted to four or five scenes total. It's wrong for a studio and director to trick people into coming in and seeing there weak political statement movie.I did like Bryce Dallas Howard a lot in the movie. She was great as the blind girl Ivy Walker. She really runs with the movie and is brillant. She's funny in places and she's dramatic in others. It really is her movie. Joaquin Phoneix was great in the movie, well when he's in it. The guy can act and he's awesome, but this is a waste of his talents. William Hurt was also good as well. Adrien Brody wastes his Best Actor talents as the mentaly challenged Noah. Sigourney Weavers part isn't all that big either.The sets in The Village were great. The town looks authentic and the forest is pretty cool. The costumes are bland and boring, I know they can't do much because Red is a forbidden color. They still could have done more to make the town look so less depressing. The music was pretty good as well.The movie was to predictable. I guessed right almost all the major plot twists throughout the movie. I probaly would have enjoyed the movie more, except for the fact that I was expecting this big dramatic thriller, and it's nothing like that. The acting and sets are good in the movie, the story just kills it. If you like M. Night Shyamalan you really are going to be disappointed by this. This is the worst movie of the year. It's nothing like what it should be.

860073,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00064LJVE,Matthew Horner,"[0, 2]","""The Village"" is a frustrating movie. On a style level, it is remarkable. The sets, the acting and the photography are first-rate. It's worth seeing for these elements alone. It's the story that's lacking. I won't `ruin' the movie for you, but I will say that the ending is absurd. It's the cinematic equivalent of a comic's long joke ending with a bad punch line.In rural America around 1900, there is a totally isolated small village. Apparently, it is surrounded on all sides by hostile creatures. The villagers have a truce with these odd beings. Life is idyllic in the town as long as no one ventures into the forest the creatures inhabit. After a couple of young people stray beyond the village's boundaries, all hell breaks loose.Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt and Adrian Brody are excellent in their roles. They try very hard to bring some meaning to the movie.In his capacity as a director, M. Night Shyamalan is first-rate as always, but, like ""Signs"". his last movie, it's his screenplay that lets us down because the ending is so implausible. This is not just an intellectual judgment. Both ""The Village"" and ""Signs"" suffered huge declines after great opening weekends in theaters. The people who go to the movies just to be entertained were also disappointed.",3,Strike 2 for Shyamalan,1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,1289,"['Village', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'style', 'level', 'remarkable', 'sets', 'acting', 'photography', 'are', 'first-rate', 'worth', 'seeing', 'elements', 'alone', 'story', 'lacking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'ending', 'absurd', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'comic', 'long', 'joke', 'ending', 'bad', 'punch', 'rural', 'America', '1900', 'totally', 'isolated', 'small', 'village', 'Apparently', 'surrounded', 'sides', 'hostile', 'creatures', 'villagers', 'have', 'truce', 'odd', 'beings', 'Life', 'idyllic', 'town', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'ventures', 'forest', 'creatures', 'inhabit', 'couple', 'young', 'people', 'stray', 'village', 'boundaries', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'bring', 'meaning', 'movie.In', 'capacity', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'first-rate', 'always', 'Signs', 'last', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'down', 'ending', 'so', 'implausible', 'not', 'just', 'intellectual', 'judgment', 'Village', 'Signs', 'suffered', 'huge', 'declines', 'great', 'opening', 'weekends', 'theaters', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'movies', 'just', 'be', 'entertained', 'were', 'also', 'disappointed']",N/A
860074,AKZ1Q9S0Z3G6V,B00064LJVE,"Matthew Perri ""Matthew Perri""","[2, 6]","July hasn't been a good month for the movies.After DC Comic fans wouldn't go see Halle Berry ham it up in a stupid S & M outfit and thus, witnessing the apocalyptic catastrophe, &quot;Catwoman&quot; rightfully crash and burn at the box office (a pathetic 3rd Place opening with $17 Mil, finishing behind the tepid &quot;I, Robot&quot;, a film that opened the week before it), &quot;The Village&quot; is a damn good breath of fresh air.I did something before seeing this movie that I don't normally do: I read just about every critic's review of the film. I hate doing that for several reasons. For one, I always have their thoughts in my head and always find the faults they point out are magnified ten times larger than normal, two, I don't like spending time talking about other critics and three, I don't want to go in with any sort of expectations other than what I saw in the trailers and T.V. spots. I remedy all of this by just reading little quips or by-lines and then wait until I've seen the movie.If you haven't read the reviews of this film, most have been highly critical of director M. Night Shyamalan who, after doing two weak movies, reloaded and turned out the fantastic ghost story, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. Somehow, in all his success, Night set himself up to fail. That film was so good and the twist at the end so mind-blowing, that he couldn't possibly live up to future releases. ""Unbreakable"" was a wonderful film giving us a glimpse of the mythical ""hero's journey"" and ""Signs"", while not very good, was effective in at least building tension before it finally petered out with no payoff.So now, after you've read all of the above (I told you I hate getting into what critics think), let's turn to ""The Village"" (opening this weekend).""We are thankful for the time we have been given,"" says Edward Walker (William Hurt) in monotone, addressing his people, who are gathered for lunch/dinner at a few long wooden tables. He ends there, seemingly trailing away from what he wanted to say. Already, there is a tense energy in the air. Something isn't right. Before this, one of the townspeople buried their child. Victim, apparently, of a gang of creatures that live in the woods surrounding the isolated and puritanical village-town of Covington, Pennsylvania. Run by a group of ""elders"" headed mostly by Walker and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver), they inform their people that they do not stray into the woods and the creatures do not go into Covington. Their loud and eerie howls fill the air, causing the townspeople's nerves to be on edge. Only the seemingly-crazed Noah Percy (Adrien Brody in a thankless role) seems to find humor and laughs outloud at the noises coming from the forest beyond...In response to the town's recent death, Alice's fearless son, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) announces to the elders that he wants to go into the woods and obtain medicine from a neighboring town. He does so, against their wishes, but is witnessed by one of the creatures to be in their territory. Because of this, all hell breaks loose. The creatures come into town, leaving red marks on every door of every building. Animals are found skinned with twisted necks.Through all this, Alice addresses the nervous townsfolk, telling them, ""we must remain vigilant""...familiar words, especially in light of current world events.If this isn't enough, Edward's blind daughter, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) has fallen for Lucius because he shares the same traits she carries. He is brave and he knows how to handle himself. He's also very morose and serious and doesn't speak much. This makes him a poor match for Edward's other daughter, Kitty, who was shot down by Lucius after she (embarrassingly) confessed her love for him. It isn't until another tragedy befalls the town that Ivy takes it upon herself to try and learn the mysteries of the woods by continuing Lucius's quest. In doing so, however, she may unlock something a lot darker and more sinister.Giving anything else away would be grounds for my arrest, trial, and execution.This movie is brilliant. It's Shyamalan's finest film since ""The Sixth Sense"" and exactly what ""Signs"" should have been: smartly written, incredibly clever, beautifully shot, and actually creepy. There is no gore in this film (save for one scene with Brody, but it's minor) and there shouldn't be any gore. Everyone who was expecting a slasher-film came to the wrong movie...looking at Shyamalan's history, you would think that moviegoers would learn that, but no, they continue to complain.The only problem I had with the movie was the cardboard acting. Everyone seems to be on auto-pilot as they walk through their lines as if they're going through a cold-reading in rehearsals. The only time this works is with Hurt, who expresses so much through his eyes and facial expressions, Phoenix, who seems like he has a chip on his shoulder and Weaver, who seems to be both tired and worried. The actress who steals the show is Bryce Dallas Howard. As Ivy, she is very much human and has fears and worries like the rest of her neighbors. However, she is also driven and keeps cool mainly because she has the luxury of not having her eyesight.Like all of Night's other films, this one is also leisurely-paced but there's always that underlying tension that gives the film its wings and because of that, it's not boring. Like Rod Serling before him, Shyamalan retains his skill of stringing you along and then trapping you when you least expect it. Again, I won't spoil the ending, but once it's revealed, you may realize that you are actually a PART of the town of Covington and that thought will haunt you long after you leave the theater.***1/2

860075,A1W6FFD9OYH5RZ,B00064LJVE,"Matt Russell ""superk23""","[2, 5]","The trailers for The Village looked really good. I especially liked the one that showed clips of M. Night Shyamalan's past films. There was one problem that I had with the trailers. They introduced the film as M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;The Village.&quot; When the director's name appears above the title of the film in order to appeal to an audience, that, in itself, is scary.The film opens in an amish-Puritan type of setting. We are quickly introduced to people known as the elders (including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Brendan Gleeson), the village idiot (Adrien Brody), and the calm guy Lucious (Joaquin Phoenix). We learn that there are creatures in the woods that surround the village and that the villagers are not allowed to enter those woods. We also learn that the creatures, who are attracted by the color red, will not disturb the village unless the village disturbs them. Guess what, Lucios disturbs them.The creatures randomly enter the village and leaves signs of their existence like red slash marks on the doors, skinned animals, and sightings. This creeps out the people bad enough to make them hide in underground shelters.Later on, Lucious is hurt and his love interest (Bryce Dallas Howard) has to leave the village to go to a town for medical supplies. While out, she is chased by a creature and has to be clever in order to escape it. She is able to reach the town and return with supplies.Of course, with this being a Shyamalan film, you can expect to see a twist. There is a twist, although, by the end of the film, there really isn't much of one.The actors do a good job. There just isn't much for them to work with. Like I said, I was really excited about the film because of the trailers. Also, as actors were being named to the project, it made me even more intrigued. Joaquin is back in his second Shyamalan film, and I really like him and don't think he gets enough credit for some of his roles. There was also the addition of Adrien Brody, who looks creepy anyway. I was hoping he would have a role like Samuel L. Jackson did in &quot;Unbreakable,&quot; but he didn't.There are little bits of clues placed throughout the movie as to the ending. One person said that &quot;any person with half a brain could figure out the ending within the first 10 minutes of the film.&quot; Apparently, I don't have half a brain because I couldn't do it in 10 minutes, more like 45. I'm a little slow, perhaps.This movie just did not grasp me. I wanted to like it, but I never could get in to it. Things would happen, and I would just be like &quot;eh.&quot; It just wasn't scary, frightening, suspenseful, or that interesting. I guess I should have known.

In the DVD special features Shyamalan explains that he originally planned for The Village to be a much harsher horror movie, but then changed his mind as they began making it.  It evolved into more of a love story than anything else.I think this film is clever, witty and interesting.  The flirty banter between the two main characters is great.  The scenery is beautiful.

The public went to the theaters expecting to see a ghoulish & bloody picture.Well... that's NOT the case.Does this mean it's poorly done or a boring film? Not at all. It is a good (if not exceptional) thriller. Good acting, good cinematography with an interesting plot.You may really enjoy it, if you do not expect what the marketing was promising.Well now, the storyline occurs in a small village surrounded by a dark menacing wood.The villagers had some strange taboos as for example the red color. Not even flowers of this color are allowed to grow. Another one is the woods everybody is forbidden to enter it; they are strictly off-limits due to an agreement between the Elders of the Village and the Outside Creatures: each community should stick to their own boundaries.At the moment the film starts this agreement is endangered and the villagers are scared of what may happen with them.From this point on a good suspense story evolves keeping the viewer wondering what's all about.Acting is one of the high points of the film.Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy the blind girl gives a very convincing performance. Mimicking a blind person convincingly is not an easy task and she complies cum laudae.Adrien Brody as a retarded youngster is great. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver also give solid acting pieces.Director M. Night Shyamalan conducts the film with sure hand, even if it is not at the same height as ""Sixth Sense"" (his best film by far).Finally: a good thriller if you seat to see it without prejudice.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",4,Beware: Red IS forbidden.,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,1683,"['difficult', 'review', 'film', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'give', 'try.First', 'think', 'previous', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'damaged', 'film', 'public', 'went', 'theaters', 'expecting', 'see', 'ghoulish', 'bloody', 'picture.Well', 'NOT', 'case.Does', 'mean', 'poorly', 'done', 'boring', 'film', 'Not', 'good', 'not', 'exceptional', 'thriller', 'Good', 'acting', 'good', 'cinematography', 'interesting', 'plot.You', 'may', 'really', 'enjoy', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'what', 'marketing', 'was', 'promising.Well', 'now', 'storyline', 'small', 'village', 'surrounded', 'dark', 'menacing', 'wood.The', 'villagers', 'had', 'strange', 'taboos', 'example', 'red', 'color', 'Not', 'even', 'flowers', 'color', 'are', 'allowed', 'grow', 'one', 'woods', 'everybody', 'forbidden', 'enter', 'are', 'strictly', 'off-limits', 'due', 'agreement', 'Elders', 'Village', 'Outside', 'Creatures', 'community', 'should', 'stick', 'own', 'boundaries.At', 'moment', 'film', 'agreement', 'endangered', 'villagers', 'are', 'scared', 'what', 'may', 'happen', 'them.From', 'point', 'good', 'suspense', 'story', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'what', 'about.Acting', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'film.Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Ivy', 'blind', 'girl', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Mimicking', 'blind', 'person', 'convincingly', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'cum', 'laudae.Adrien', 'Brody', 'retarded', 'youngster', 'great', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'also', 'give', 'solid', 'acting', 'pieces.Director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'sure', 'hand', 'even', 'not', 'same', 'height', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'best', 'film', 'far', '.Finally', 'good', 'thriller', 'seat', 'see', 'prejudice.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

860082,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00064LJVE,M. Burns,"[5, 8]","(Don't worry, no spoilers here.) Shyamalan, the director of three of the most interesting and well-made movies I've seen in half a decade, built his career upon a rock (The Sixth Sense). That 1999 thriller came out of the blue and captured its audience with the nuance of its narrative and...of course...that twist ending. He followed it up with Unbreakable, an underrated film that had plenty of potent drama but seemed less natural in its flow. In 2002, we got Signs, one of the finest films of that year, but another that (looking at it recently) seemed more distanced and tidy. He's made The Village now, and he's reached the end of his rope.The problem with The Village doesn't so much lie within its plot (well, for the first two thirds of the film). The main issue is that the persona of the director has overriden the creative material itself. We see inhabitants of a quaint little colonial village, learn that there is evil lurking in the woods surrounding it, encounter scenes that hint at that mystery...but the whole damn time, we're just thinking about how it's not what we think, how there's going to be a gigantic twist at the end, and how there are things right in front of us that are giving it away. M. Night Shyamalan has ruined his audience, and this movie simply can't recover from it.Lucky for us, though, the film does come with at least a few perks. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, though not at the top of his game (The Man Who Wasn't There - rent it and drool) at least lends a stark visual tone to the film. James Newton Howard's score is quite mediocre most of the time, but every once in a while a flourish of rapid violins takes it up a notch. And Bryce Dallas Howard should be able to make ends meet without the shadow of her father Ron in the way; her performance (and only her performance) is a revelation of subtlety and ease that should have been copied by the whole cast.But it's not, and so we get to listen to Shyamalan's ear-bleedingly awkward dialogue uttered by some of the finest actors around, and they look patently ridiculous doing it. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Joaquin Phoenix all talk like HAL 9000 put his word-a-day calender to use. Village meetings and other gatherings of the like are as wooden as the structures around them, and Adrien Brody proves yet again that his best role will always be the one in The Thin Red Line...when he didn't speak.What about the underlying themes, the scary moments, and the plot that gets ever-so-closer to complete flip-flop? Most of those moments are kind of negated, thanks to the fact that we've been trained like Pavlov's dog to slobber for the twist by the opening credits. I was impressed with a few scenes: an early encounter with 'The Ones of Whom We Do Not Speak' (I corrected it from what it is in the movie because, well, it's grammatically incorrect) is quite suspenseful, just about any scene that Howard has is watchable, and a later chase in the woods is downright exciting if you don't think about it too much. And, oh thank God for this, an underlying theme (and mini-twist) of the movie is quite intelligent, if it only hadn't been discarded soon after.Let me be the first (of many) to say that the twist of the movie is stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. Movies like The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, and Swimming Pool exist on their own volition and are only heightened by that &quot;Gotcha!&quot; moment. This movie centers around it the entire time, and upon its unveling, it's not only downright ridiculous, but it's a wrong-headed thematic message that I found to be flat-out disgusting.I think I know what Shyamalan was trying to say with this movie, and it sickens me. The Village is about fear and how we cope with it (that's not giving anything away; watch the damn trailer), and what Shyamalan says with the film's final scene had me nearly as angry as I was months ago watching Von Trier's Dogville. The message of this movie is cowardly and unrealistic, and I'm sad that (1) many people won't even realize it and (2) some people might actually agree with it. This movie had its moments of above-mediocrity, but in the end it made me mad. You might not get mad, though; you might be laughing too much when that twist actually does come.

It is so much more than a horror or a slasher film though.The story is set in the isolated village of Covington, Pennsylvania.  The close-knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding woods, and no one will venture beyond the borders of the village and into the woods.  Lucius Hunt, played by Joaquin Phoenix, decides to find out what lies outside Covington, and unwittingly invites the wrath of the creatures upon the town.The Village stars Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Adrien Brody, Judy Greer, and Bryce Dallas Howard - quite a cast!This Manoj Night Shyamalan creation is his best yet.  The subtle nuances of the characters are brilliantly done and the slowly built up suspense works to make this a thriller and a mystery.

A little community isolated, surrounded by a forest and with threatening creatures living in.The film is correct. Shyamalan knows what he is doing and also, let's face it, he has his own peculiar style. But in spite of some moments when I jumped from my seat, I think the idea of the film is again a game with us, poor viewers being teased by the director.I like the part  of the film when the life in the village is depicted, but unfortunately it is too short. The characters are too bi-dimensional. And also too stereotypical. The blind girl who can see what others cannot, the leader of the community, the represion in which all of them are living.Personally I think that the critic of fear as a way to manipulate  people is very interesting; but this idea vanishes as long as we are put in the middle of a regular fairy tale. The girl pursued by the big bad woolf, the woods as the primal source of fear, and an end that is shocking only for a moment.The director has created a beautiful package for an irrelevant story.

Having enjoyed THE SIXTH SENSE immensely and finding UNBREAKABLE fairly so, I had expectations for this film, even though it received mostly negative critical response.  I can see why.  THE VILLAGE is atmospheric and Roger Deakins cinematography is sometimes breathtakingly beautiful, as is James Newton Howard's haunting and evocative score.  The problem is that Night has paced the movie so languidly, and gives away his surprise twist early in the movie, so that when it comes at the end, I smiled and said, I thought so.  It's hard to give away much of the plot in this film without spoiling it for viewers who haven't seen it yet, so I won't go there.  Bryce Dallas Howard owns the movie with her controlled, passionate performance as Ivy.  Joaquin Phoenix always seems to whisper, so his dialogue is at times very difficult to focus on.  William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are competent but wasted in poorly developed roles.  Oscar winner Adrien Brody isn't very impressive either in his role as the obvious village idiot.  The movie doesn't succeed as a horror movie as there is little horror in it; as a suspense movie, it's too deliberately paced; and as a romance story, it only manages to briefly touch the spark between Howard and Phoenix.

Night 'canvas-picture', 'The Village.' What I could only describe as undercooked, dry, and palid with emotion, this film is just that. Forget anything you've seen in the falsified advertisements, this is not that film. In fact, stay home and read some HP Lovecraft, and you're bound for a far more entertaining night. Yes, my friends, 'The Village' is that bad.In all of M. Night's intriguing films, and this is not sarcastic, I do love his films, he uses a formula. Build up, build up, tension, scare, twist. It's standard now. In fact, it's so standard, I was able to call this entire film, two weeks ago, before I even saw the thing. If that doesn't tell you about the writing, then I guess I'll have to say it, 'this is one of the most poorly written films, ever.' And, I loved 'Signs', even enjoyed 'Unbreakable' albeit overly depressing, and yes, 'The Sixth Sense' gets me, even to this day. Let me tell you more on this 'Village.'The film is not a horror film and it is not a thrillfest, it really isn't. 'Are You Afraid of the Dark' accomplished that better. No, no, this film is a romantic drama with an eerie backdrop. It's social commentary without any of the real context. It's well, crap. The writing as far as I'm concerned is what really drags this film down. We watch as characters are haunted by 'monsters' in the woods, yet we don't feel for them. Why? Because they are highly underdeveloped and they never go anywhere, with the exception maybe of Mr. Ron Howard's daughter, who does a fine job acting, but her character is flawed. All the characters are flawed, even William Hurt's, one of America's finest actors.What else can I say without being so subtle and telling you to just go see 'I, Robot' or 'Spiderman 2' again? Well, the directing itself would have raised the bar on this film. As usual, M. Night does not fail in creating a visually stunning film, but what does it matter if the rest fails miserably. Even James Newton Howard's score is underwhelming...it does nothing, until maybe the the end, but even then, it doesn't fit.And also, the social commentary, I can't say anything for 'fear' that I'll ruin this &quot;contemporary classic.&quot; But, if he wanted to lay very great themes down...he should have made sure the other things worked as well. You don't realize something if what's there is as jumbled as a five year old completing a 400 piece puzzle. You just don't. I understand where he was coming from, but no, I didn't enjoy coming to that conclusion, so therefore, he failed.With the acting there, but directed nowhere(thanks to Hollywood's finest...worst screenplay), and the direction solid but output unstable, this film is a catastrophe. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster, but one that never left and when it finally did, it started and then stopped.

860101,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B00064LJVE,Michael Zuffa,"[6, 8]","M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie takes us to the late-19th century town of Covington. A town surrounded by woods that have creatures prowling in them. It seems that the townspeople have an understanding with these creatures: if the townspeople stay out of their woods, they will stay out of their town. And so, this community has thrived safely for many years. But, there are younger folk in the village that think they can safely pass through the woods into the outer towns if their intentions are pure. They reason that the creatures will see this pureness and let them pass. This is the argument that Lucius (Phoenix) presents to the elders. Of course, the elders forbid it, fearing for not only his safety, but the villagers' as well. When Those We Don't Speak Of enter the village one night, the elders take this as a sign that they must stay out of the woods. Soon it becomes a matter of life or death that the blind girl Ivy (Howard) pass throught the woods on a quest to the towns, and she must muster up her courage to deal with the beings in the woods.If you have seen the trailer for this movie, and thing you know what the movie is about, you are wrong. There are few scary moments in this movie, but they are very effective. Instead, the movie focuses on the love triangle (of sorts) between Lucious, Ivy, and the town idiot Noah (Brody). Their relationship drives the events of the movie, and all three do an excellent job with their characters. The biggest role of the three, surprisingly, is Ivy's. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter), in her first starring role is what makes this movie work. As for the expected Shuamalan twists, there are two. One did not surprise me and one sort of did. There is no revelation here along the lines of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, and that is probably what everyone will be waiting for. Despite the good acting, there really is not too much here. It is not a bad film, but it is not great either. Instead, it falls somewhere in the OK range. Unfortunate, but at least it gives Howard a platform to show that she has what it takes to be a great actress.",3,The Village,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,2114,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'latest', 'movie', 'late-19th', 'century', 'town', 'Covington', 'town', 'surrounded', 'woods', 'have', 'creatures', 'prowling', 'townspeople', 'have', 'understanding', 'creatures', 'townspeople', 'stay', 'woods', 'will', 'stay', 'town', 'so', 'community', 'thrived', 'safely', 'many', 'years', 'are', 'younger', 'folk', 'village', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'pass', 'woods', 'outer', 'towns', 'intentions', 'are', 'pure', 'reason', 'creatures', 'will', 'see', 'pureness', 'let', 'pass', 'argument', 'Lucius', 'Phoenix', 'elders', 'course', 'elders', 'forbid', 'fearing', 'not', 'only', 'safety', 'villagers', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Speak', 'enter', 'village', 'one', 'night', 'elders', 'take', 'sign', 'must', 'stay', 'woods', 'Soon', 'matter', 'life', 'death', 'blind', 'girl', 'Ivy', 'Howard', 'pass', 'throught', 'woods', 'quest', 'towns', 'must', 'muster', 'up', 'courage', 'deal', 'beings', 'woods.If', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'movie', 'thing', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'are', 'wrong', 'are', 'few', 'scary', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'Instead', 'movie', 'love', 'triangle', 'sorts', 'Lucious', 'Ivy', 'town', 'idiot', 'Noah', 'Brody', 'relationship', 'events', 'movie', 'three', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'characters', 'biggest', 'role', 'three', 'surprisingly', 'Ivy', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'daughter', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'expected', 'Shuamalan', 'are', 'two', 'One', 'did', 'not', 'surprise', 'one', 'sort', 'did', 'revelation', 'here', 'lines', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'probably', 'what', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'good', 'acting', 'really', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'Instead', 'somewhere', 'OK', 'range', 'Unfortunate', 'least', 'Howard', 'platform', 'show', 'what', 'be', 'great', 'actress']",N/A

Night Shyamalan. Though several others have tried to copy his exact style of filmmaking, complete with the signature twist ending, few have developed the same kind of success he has enjoyed, whether it concerns the numbers at the box office or the fan base his films have developed. Ever since 1999's surprise fall hit, The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan has been terrifying audiences across the world with his takes on ghosts, superheroes, and aliens, but after several years it seems as though he may be giving the old gig a break for awhile. Reports leaking out of Hollywood have indicated that The Village may be the last thriller he will work on for awhile as his next project is set to be the film adaptation of the novel, The Lady in the Water. Preferably he would like to go out on top in the genre he essentially perfected but that is all up to how the American public will receive it, or reject it.The story centers on an isolated group of villagers who find themselves confined to their town by the mysterious creatures that roam the woods that encircle them. In the year 1897, the village of Covington, Pennsylvania can be seen as the prime example of a utopian society - there is no violence, no greed, and all work together in upholding the vision of hope that has driven the villagers to bountiful blessings, something the elders of the town believe will continue through the leadership of their children. Covington, to the untrained eye, may seem perfect but the element of fear still dwells within the occupants of the town. What would inhabitants of a utopian society such as this have to fear? ""Those we do not speak of"" - red hooded creatures that reside in the woods and make raids on the town when they feel they have been threatened. None have the courage to venture beyond the forbidden border, except Lucius Hunt, the head strong yet reserved son of Alice Hunt, one of the town elders. Lucius feels compelled to defy the boundaries of the village but at the same time he dares not leave out of the fear, the only one he has, that harm will come to Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the leading town elder with whom he has fallen deeply in love with. But when an accident occurs in the village and Lucius is found seriously injured, Ivy demands that she be given permission to enter the woods and obtain medicine from the nearby towns.The story for The Village sadly suffers from an acute identity crisis, playing out more like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone then the usual Shyamalan thriller fare audience have come acquainted with. This is not to say that it does not attempt to be entertaining. In fact the first half is actually quite engaging, but around the midway point everything begins to fall apart rather extensively. Another Shyamalan feature, The Sixth Sense, suffered a similar trait to that of The Village, this being the less then surprising twist ending. If this film was able to have as genuine and masterfully orchestrated a storyline as The Sixth Sense had then it more then likely would not have been a problem. Unfortunately, Shyamalan demonstrates clearly that he is either losing his once golden touch or he is running low on decent material to scare audiences with.With as talented an accumulation of performers as is seen in The Village, the most high-profile cast ever assembled by director M. Night Shyamalan, you would believe it would be no problem for a film with as weak of a script as this to be brought up to the level of at least some toleration but that is not true here. Bryce Dallas Howard, credited in the film industry as only being the daughter of director Ron Howard, makes a surprisingly brilliant debut in the role of Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the leading town elder. All Shyamalan films contain a lead role that tests even the most skilled of actors and Howard is able to tackle the role easily without showing once any inability to rise to the challenge, which indicates she could be a rising star in Hollywood if she continues to give prime performances such as this. Joaquin Phoenix, in the role of Lucius Hunt, demonstrates that he certainly has the charisma and talent to lead a film with an engaging and emotionally driven performance, far exceeding the role given to him for Signs. And Adrien Brody gives an emotionally charged, if not often perplexing, roller coaster performance as Noah, the mentally challenged son of the leading town elder. There are times where he can make you laugh, make cry, have you feel sorry for him only to turn around and do something that provokes the opposite effect with the audience. The character of Noah is the combination of both the talent of Brody and dexterous construction from Shymalan's script. The problem with the cast is that there are too many of them for the audience to keep track of each individual character plot. The brilliance about Shyamalan's past films was that he kept the group of characters relatively small in order to allow the audience to singularly focus on the actions of the main characters and not have them confused by separate character developments. The filmmaker diverts from his usually agenda and that in effect hurts the film's script severely.Overall, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan trades in his philanthropic messages on humanity and supernatural fantasies come to life for some cheap scares and a story that may turn out to be an accidental rip off of a classic science-fiction television series. Though Shyamalan makes no direct assertions within the nearly two hour long feature and leaves this up to interpretation, there are slight assumption that The Village may be a political commentary on the current climate of the United States following the September 11th terrorist attacks.What evidence is there within the framework of the film that would support this theory? For starters, the color coded system the villagers develop, yellow indicating safety and red implying fear and danger, overtly resembles the terrorism warning levels developed by Homeland Security Department following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The creatures that wander the woods and raid the town when threatened are nothing more then false reports developed by the elders to keep the townspeople in fear and prevent them from leaving the village, which may be a reference to the accusations made by the liberals about the Bush administration whenever they release a terror alert. And the most convenient piece of evidence lies in the name of the lead elder who orchestrates the entire faade: Walker, which may or may not be an allusion to the current commander in chief's middle name. True, the deception was performance in order to preserve the innocence of the children, but as the old saying goes, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.Even if that theory were to be proven true, only a hand full of individuals would probably pick up on the message and it would not affect a person's perception of the film even if he/she agreed with what was being said. In other aspects of the film, James Newton Howard is once again able to calibrate a successful and chilling musical score that works directly in sync with the actions on screen, as he has been able to do in all of Shyamalan's films in the past. And even though Shyamalan's engaging sense of direction allows the psychological intensity of the film to remain intact through nearly the entire presentation, the less then surprising outcomes makes it out to be all for naught. There are three twist endings to the film: the first seems misplaced as it totally eliminates the element of fear that is associated with the creatures, the second isn't so much a problem as it is obvious especially if you're one who pays close attention to certain characters, and the final twist gives you the feeling as though you were watching an episode of The Twilight Zone, leaving the audience neither shocked nor amazed, just swindled. But the film's most disappointing aspect is the fact that the audience is left at the end with nothing; no fear, no hope. The Village is the first Shyamalan thriller that eliminates the sense of fear movie-goers would take home with them when it reveals the creatures weren't real. This was the key that made Shymalan thrillers classics to so many people. Whether it is a political allegory or merely a coincidence, either way you slice it The Village is a sure-fire disappointment.",3,The Moose Hole - Don't Enter 'The Village'!,1091145600,"07 30,

There is a clear connection to the twoHowever, M.Night has he own style and man, can he add emotions to even the simplest scenes. His movies tend to make me cry like a baby and i'm not a cryer.And for &8&8 sake can people stop relating everything to The Sixth Sense. I mean it prob one of his best films and certainly touched a larger auidence but the guy does have more to offer than this and its a tad unfair to always compare every movie he makes to that one really but him on the map. When we live in a world of fast, cellioud, popcorn movies, it is both re-freshing and important to embrace films that have directors who can make different, thought provoking films that actually make you think and question - not just eye candy for the eyes.Granted his films ARE slow moving, they CAN tend to make people question some of his logic, they CAN even bore people to tears but man, can he write a story that you both think and talk about for days after. He is a story teller first and film maker second and has demonstrated 4 times now that he can deliver on both.Six Sense was a introduction really to M.Night (yes i know he made two films prior but im talking about the commerical films only). UnBreakable was never going to live up to the 6th Sense but still delivers a interesting, fasinating story that held me to the end with a conclusion that was so obvious but yet not expected by me. Signs was a major commerical hit and once again deliver a fine story that was excuted in a way that just oozed emotion and interest for any viewer who likes a good story and film-making. Lastly The Village provides another great tale with brooding emotion. M.Night likes to make a set/or the environments isolated i have found and we tend to focus in all his movies on a very claustphobic environment that just sucks the intellegent viewer in.I have come to realise that people always concertrate on the suspense, horror and twists of a M.Night film and maybe thats why some find them slow and boring. But what the man SHOULD be awarded for is his ability to create a great emotional drama. I truely believe this man can film a person standing in a field and induce so much emtion somehow from the scene that it makes yah eyes tear up. M.Night is a serious film maker who develops emotional stories first and adds the supernatural elements second.As far as i am concerned he is a modern day filmaker using old style filmamking in the tradition of Hitchcock and his films stand out from the wham, bam movies of today. The films are about story and emotion not effects or explosions.Pesonally, in real life, the man would prob drive me nuts with his ego and need to write , direct,act and gloat over his films but i respect him for his clear talent in film making and ability to make a film that stands out in a Western Culture and his sheer passion towards making his films.In regards to The Village, i say this.....a brillant film that moves slowly but constintely and will hold for those who appriectate a good tale with dramatic flair.And as i said in my movie review....THIS ISNT A MONSTER FILM, TIS A DRAMATIC PIECE WITH A SUPERNATURAL FEEL.....so if u want a monster film that will scare the pants off you this aint it. But if u want creepy, spooky and at times damn sad then this is for you.Keep it up M.Night !!!!",4,Excellent Film-Making !!!,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,3963,"['have', 'already', 'written', 'review', 'thoughts', 'film', 'just', 'wanted', 'add', 'IS', 'classic', 'film', 'making', 'not', 'superfical', 'action', 'monster', 'film.Sure', 'M.Night', 'ego', 'manaic', 'who', 'really', 'making', 'what', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'probabely', 'tyrant', 'work', 'man', 'deliever', 'old', 'style', 'story', 'telling', 'film', '-making', 'few', 'modern', 'other', 'words', 'man', 'deliever', 'different', 'classic', 'films', 'tradition', 'old', 'film', 'makers', 'Alferd', 'Hitchcock.I', 'studied', 'movies', 'life', 'Hitchcock', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'university', 'M.Night', 'Mr', 'Hitch', 'one', 'favourtite', 'directors', 'clear', 'connection', 'twoHowever', 'M.Night', 'own', 'style', 'man', 'can', 'add', 'emotions', 'even', 'simplest', 'scenes', 'movies', 'tend', 'make', 'cry', 'baby', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'cryer.And', '8', '8', 'sake', 'can', 'people', 'stop', 'relating', 'everything', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'mean', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'certainly', 'touched', 'larger', 'auidence', 'guy', 'have', 'more', 'offer', 'tad', 'unfair', 'always', 'compare', 'movie', 'one', 'really', 'map', 'When', 'live', 'world', 'fast', 'cellioud', 'popcorn', 'movies', 're-freshing', 'important', 'embrace', 'films', 'have', 'directors', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'different', 'thought', 'provoking', 'films', 'actually', 'make', 'think', 'question', 'not', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'eyes.Granted', 'films', 'ARE', 'slow', 'moving', 'CAN', 'tend', 'make', 'people', 'question', 'logic', 'CAN', 'even', 'bore', 'people', 'tears', 'man', 'can', 'write', 'story', 'think', 'talk', 'days', 'story', 'teller', 'first', 'film', 'maker', 'second', 'demonstrated', '4', 'times', 'now', 'can', 'deliver', 'both.Six', 'Sense', 'was', 'introduction', 'really', 'M.Night', 'yes', 'i', 'know', 'made', 'two', 'films', 'prior', 'im', 'talking', 'commerical', 'films', 'only', 'UnBreakable', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'live', 'up', '6th', 'Sense', 'still', 'interesting', 'fasinating', 'story', 'held', 'end', 'conclusion', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'yet', 'not', 'expected', 'Signs', 'was', 'major', 'commerical', 'hit', 'once', 'again', 'deliver', 'fine', 'story', 'was', 'excuted', 'way', 'just', 'oozed', 'emotion', 'interest', 'viewer', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'film-making', 'Lastly', 'Village', 'great', 'tale', 'brooding', 'emotion', 'M.Night', 'make', 'set/or', 'environments', 'isolated', 'i', 'have', 'found', 'tend', 'focus', 'movies', 'very', 'claustphobic', 'environment', 'just', 'intellegent', 'viewer', 'in.I', 'have', 'come', 'realise', 'people', 'always', 'concertrate', 'suspense', 'horror', 'twists', 'M.Night', 'film', 'maybe', 'thats', 'why', 'find', 'slow', 'boring', 'what', 'man', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'awarded', 'ability', 'create', 'great', 'emotional', 'drama', 'truely', 'believe', 'man', 'can', 'film', 'person', 'standing', 'field', 'induce', 'so', 'much', 'emtion', 'somehow', 'scene', 'yah', 'eyes', 'tear', 'up', 'M.Night', 'serious', 'film', 'maker', 'who', 'emotional', 'stories', 'first', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'second.As', 'far', 'i', 'am', 'concerned', 'modern', 'day', 'filmaker', 'using', 'old', 'style', 'filmamking', 'tradition', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'stand', 'out', 'wham', 'bam', 'movies', 'today', 'films', 'are', 'story', 'emotion', 'not', 'effects', 'explosions.Pesonally', 'real', 'life', 'man', 'would', 'prob', 'drive', 'nuts', 'ego', 'need', 'write', 'direct', 'act', 'gloat', 'films', 'i', 'respect', 'clear', 'talent', 'film', 'making', 'ability', 'make', 'film', 'out', 'Western', 'Culture', 'sheer', 'passion', 'making', 'films.In', 'regards', 'Village', 'i', 'say', '..a', 'brillant', 'film', 'slowly', 'constintely', 'will', 'hold', 'who', 'appriectate', 'good', 'tale', 'dramatic', 'flair.And', 'i', 'said', 'movie', 'review', 'A', 'MONSTER', 'FILM', 'TIS', 'A', 'DRAMATIC', 'PIECE', 'WITH', 'A', 'SUPERNATURAL', 'FEEL', '..so', 'u', 'want', 'monster', 'film', 'will', 'scare', 'pants', 'aint', 'u', 'want', 'creepy', 'spooky', 'times', 'damn', 'sad', 'then', 'you.Keep', 'up', 'M.Night']",N/A
860105,A1OXUVBFZAAQAQ,B00064LJVE,minguy,"[3, 6]","What I was expecting from ""The Village"" was a supernatural thriller about some mysterious creatures in the woods. What I got was an allegory on morality, power, and fear. Which begs the question: would I have enjoyed the film more if I had gone in with the right expectations? Honestly, I don't think so.This is because my expectations were based on something more important, more fundamental than the particular genre of the picture. I was looking for a story to be drawn into and characters to be emotionally invested in. I wanted to be moved and enthralled and entertained. And unfortunately, Shyamalan's latest is a huge disappointment in this respect.First let me say, I have no problems with the twist at the end. Although I was underwhelmed, the revelation only alters the context (thematic implications), not the text itself (story). The strengths of Shyamalan's previous mainstream movies have always been the characters and the relationships between them. At the very core of ""The Village"" is the budding love between Ivy Walker (Howard) and Lucius Hunt (Phoenix). This relationship is the heart of this film and is crucial to the life of the story. The issue is not that Shyamalan is unable to pull off the romance (their union is a bit heavy-handed and abrupt, but Howard and Phoenix manage to smooth out the kinks with their charm). Rather, the problem is that it is never fully realized. Shyamalan doesn't allow enough screen time for the most important element of the narrative to grow and take hold. This is most evident in the final moments of the film when the last line of dialogue is uttered. The credits roll and there is no catharsis, no exultation, no sense of fulfillment or completion.I think the source of the problem lies in the conflicting intentions of the filmmaker. What I see in ""The Village"" is two separate films: a love story about sacrifice and courage, and a philosophical meditation on fear and control. Instead of featuring one on the surface and burying the other underneath, Shyamalan attempts a balancing act of narrative and social commentary that, although interesting on their own, fail to mesh together into a cohesive whole. The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to believe that Shyamalan cared more for his message than his characters. Was the love story simply a tool to hook us in emotionally and to add power to the ideas he's putting forth? Sure seems like it. I suppose, intellectually, it is appropriate for a film about secrets to be presented in a deceptive manner. But emotionally, it makes for a hollow moviegoing experience.Despite its weaknesses, ""The Village"" is not a complete loss. The love between Ivy and Lucius is deeply moving in its simplicity and purity. And with a crew as skilled as the cast, it is no surprise that the technical aspects of the film are beyond reproach. Although not quite as memorable as some of Shyamalan's other pictures, the presentation of ""The Village"" possesses an alluring beauty in Roger Deakin's cinematography and James Newton Howard's music.The best example of this is the scene where Ivy stands by an open door and waits for Lucius in the midst of danger. It is a captivating moment, full of power and grace in its lyrical images and engaging violin melody. Like all great cinema, the sequence is noteworthy not only for what you can see on the surface (a story element that vividly crystallizes Ivy's and Lucius' love) but also for what you can sense underneath (a subtle reflection on blindness, fear, love, vulnerability and courage).Of all of M. Night Shyamalan's mainstream films, ""The Village"" is my least favorite. As a social commentary, it is thought-provoking but clumsy. As a romance, it starts off well but never comes to fruition. And as a suspense thriller, it simply fails to thrill or entertain.",3,"philosophically INTRIGUING, emotionally UNFULFILLING",1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,3823,"['What', 'was', 'expecting', 'Village', 'was', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'mysterious', 'creatures', 'woods', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'allegory', 'morality', 'power', 'fear', 'question', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'had', 'gone', 'right', 'expectations', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.This', 'expectations', 'were', 'based', 'something', 'more', 'important', 'more', 'fundamental', 'particular', 'genre', 'picture', 'was', 'looking', 'story', 'be', 'drawn', 'characters', 'be', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'wanted', 'be', 'moved', 'enthralled', 'entertained', 'unfortunately', 'Shyamalan', 'latest', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'respect.First', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'problems', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'underwhelmed', 'revelation', 'only', 'context', 'thematic', 'implications', 'not', 'text', 'story', 'strengths', 'Shyamalan', 'previous', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'characters', 'relationships', 'very', 'core', 'Village', 'budding', 'love', 'Ivy', 'Walker', 'Howard', 'Lucius', 'Hunt', 'Phoenix', 'relationship', 'heart', 'film', 'crucial', 'life', 'story', 'issue', 'not', 'Shyamalan', 'unable', 'pull', 'off', 'romance', 'union', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'abrupt', 'Howard', 'Phoenix', 'manage', 'smooth', 'out', 'kinks', 'charm', 'problem', 'never', 'fully', 'realized', 'Shyamalan', ""n't"", 'allow', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'narrative', 'grow', 'take', 'hold', 'most', 'evident', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'last', 'line', 'dialogue', 'uttered', 'credits', 'roll', 'catharsis', 'exultation', 'sense', 'fulfillment', 'completion.I', 'think', 'source', 'problem', 'conflicting', 'intentions', 'filmmaker', 'What', 'see', 'Village', 'two', 'separate', 'films', 'love', 'story', 'sacrifice', 'courage', 'philosophical', 'meditation', 'fear', 'control', 'Instead', 'featuring', 'one', 'surface', 'burying', 'other', 'underneath', 'Shyamalan', 'balancing', 'act', 'narrative', 'social', 'commentary', 'interesting', 'own', 'fail', 'mesh', 'together', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'more', 'think', 'more', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'believe', 'Shyamalan', 'cared', 'more', 'message', 'characters', 'Was', 'love', 'story', 'simply', 'tool', 'hook', 'emotionally', 'add', 'power', 'ideas', 'putting', 'forth', 'Sure', 'suppose', 'intellectually', 'appropriate', 'film', 'secrets', 'be', 'presented', 'deceptive', 'manner', 'emotionally', 'hollow', 'moviegoing', 'experience.Despite', 'weaknesses', 'Village', 'not', 'complete', 'loss', 'love', 'Ivy', 'Lucius', 'deeply', 'moving', 'simplicity', 'purity', 'crew', 'as', 'skilled', 'cast', 'surprise', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'reproach', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'memorable', 'Shyamalan', 'other', 'pictures', 'presentation', 'Village', 'alluring', 'beauty', 'Roger', 'Deakin', 'cinematography', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'music.The', 'best', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Ivy', 'open', 'door', 'waits', 'Lucius', 'midst', 'danger', 'captivating', 'moment', 'full', 'power', 'grace', 'lyrical', 'images', 'engaging', 'violin', 'melody', 'great', 'cinema', 'sequence', 'noteworthy', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'surface', 'story', 'element', 'vividly', 'Ivy', 'Lucius', 'love', 'also', 'what', 'can', 'sense', 'underneath', 'subtle', 'reflection', 'blindness', 'fear', 'love', 'vulnerability', 'courage', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'mainstream', 'films', 'Village', 'least', 'favorite', 'social', 'commentary', 'thought-provoking', 'clumsy', 'romance', 'off', 'well', 'never', 'fruition', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'simply', 'thrill', 'entertain']",N/A

I think that this film, and all of his following films, is where Shyamalan's ego really got the better of him.One thing I do like about this film is the premise. M. Night Shyamalan, if nothing else, really does have great imagination when it comes to the premises of his films, including this one. However, a premise is not enough. You need good execution that is where the film falls flat.The characters are all wooden and boring. There was not one character that I was invested in. Because of this I found the movie very boring. The acting is awful as well. I do not think that anyone in the cast does a good job. Joaquin Phoenox is is this film as well. I dod not know what happened. I thought he did a fine job in Signs. However, here he was as dull as a rock.The score did nothing for me. I remember nothing from the score of this film. The production values were nice I have to say. It is a good looking film with some creepy imagery at times. The design of the creatures were cool as well.Overall this film had much potential that was sadly wasted.

It should be made clear that a lot of the mixed reception this movie has received has been due to misunderstanding it or having different expectations of it. This is not a horror movie. Nor is it mainly about the creatures.The story follows a group of villagers who live in a valley basically isolated from ""the towns"" by a forest. In this forest live some creatures who the villagers always refer to in indirect ways. Between the villagers and the creatures there is a truce of sorts: the villagers do not enter the forest and the creatures do not enter the village.Events come to a head when Lucius Hunt volunteers to enter the woods to get medicine from the towns. This was precipitated by the death of a young boy. Hunt himself is stabbed, and needs the medicine himself, so his new fiance agrees to make the journey. The catch: she is blind.Unlike some reviewers, I didn't have the foresight to guess Shyamalan's twist for this movie, but I was very pleased to be caught out completely.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and in some places it still made me jump in fright. However, if you are expecting a movie about the creatures and the terrors they visit upon the village, you will be disapointed. The movie's focus is on much wider issues and deeper ideas. In this discussion of deeper issues the movie does exceptionally well. It presents possibilities with skill and flair. I can't say much more without risking giving some hints about the story's twist.Finally, I found that this movie grew on me. As I thought about the questions and issues it raises, I found myself liking the movie more and more.

I rented the village, expecting something good out of who they call MASTER OF SUSPENSE M.NIGHT SHAMALAN. But this movie was ridicuous!! It wasn't scary?! It's as if while writing this story, he smoked somethig and finished it in a hurry. The creatures were made up?? Come on How is that suspense. It made no sense. It lost my interest. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I was bored out of my skull. And this is the same guy who wrote sixth sense, and signs. Both were good films. This movie the village was horrible. I couldnt believe they called this the best thriller of the year? More like the best borer of the decade. I wasted my money. I guess they think we're all idiots who are easily entertained by one stupid twist....a very lame twist, that completely lost tthe whole purpose of what people were expecting out of the movie.The monsters! They were fake?? oh wow what a great idea? Is that absurd or what. Sixth sense was genius.. maybe it was written with help from others. Tis movie was slow and it dragged on. And i was very disgusted that they killed the animals just to scare the village. What next human sacrifices. That's immoral. The whole idea of messing with their own families heads was just haneous. Adrian Brody did a horrible job acting as a mentally disabled boy. Joaquin was too good for this film. I havent even rented any movies since this.

In spite of worthy performances by stars such as Sigourney Weaver and Joaquin Phoenix along with a brilliant performance by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard as blind Ivy Walker, the film somehow falls flat. There is none of the sense of increasing unease that we have come to expect with Shymalan's movies, and the ending, for once, could be seen coming from very early on in the story.Some people have viewed this as a horror story, others as a drama but it doesn't really manage to fall into either genre comfortably.

It was not the horror I was expecting it to be, although there is still some tense moments throughout the film.The storyline is clever as you would expect from a M. Night Shyalmalan film. I won't go into the actual storyline here as it has been done before. I just have a few things that I would like to say. Firstly, I think Ivy is  a wonderful character and the acting here is superb. Parts of the film were a bit unbelievable for me. There was some strong minded strong characters, i.e. Lucies and Ivy who are prepared to blindly follow the course of the elders in the village.In fact I believe that Lucies had the secret of the elders guessed and this is why he seems so brave to others and why he asks to leave the village. It is almost like he is inviting them to tell him.The whole concept of the film is a very interesting one, which shows how people might live in order to avoid the evil person in the world.

860134,AD2ELU7QN8E0L,B00064LJVE,Musemom,"[5, 8]","For all those daunted by the reveiws out there that degrade this movie, please read this.  I am what may be considered a fan of M. Night Shyamalan - I have seen all three of his previous movies and enjoyed them very much.I found this movie to be thrilling, well paced, and enjoyable.  I have heard some say that it is not thrilling at all because the monsters looked so fake.  All I can say is, even though they looked like ""warthogs, dressed up like bushes in cloaks"", I was still jumping out of my skin.Another point brought up is that the movie is too slow.  If the ""slow"" parts did not equal the thrilling parts, it would become either A) a half-hour Japanamation flick, or B) a sci-fi thriller with no plot.  Hence, slower=boring, not interesting, and not exciting; faster=no story, not interesting, and exciting(but why bother?).I was willing to look beyond all the bad reviews, and have found a very good movie.  As for its being enjoyable, you will have to watch it and determine an opinion for yourself.P.S. - I began counting at the begining of the movie and (though I lost count some-where) I counted at least 50 prepositions.REVISION:I would like to point out that my previous feelings and my current feelings go to show that some movies are just better in the theature...you don't see all the holes there.I would now like to take this space to contrast this movie with the wonderfully culty (and subtly Catholic) Signs.In Signs, the main conflict was between Graham and God, as simplified by the relationship between Graham and his son.  This is a very important and moving theme for todays world, and the resolution was very clear and enlightening.In the Village, the main conflict that I see is between the parents and their fears.  While these fears are obviously well grounded, they are unfortunatly delt with in the wrong way.  I mean, running away and cloistering themselves in a corner, cowering, and FRIGHTENING their children into staying away from the ""real world"".  That's like saying, ""don't sin - the boggie man will get you.""  The parents take this opportunity to teach their children valuable lessons in TRUE courage, then wimp out..As a homeschooler, I find a certain point about this movie very important to make. I've aqctually had people come up to me and ask, ""but if your so shelterd, how are you going to make it in the 'real world'?""  These people, like the Village parents, have forgotten about the REAL real world: Heaven.  If you suddenly force temporal issues on the fragile person a child is, you shatter any hope of teaching them anything life-affirming.  On the other hand, parents shouldn't follow the example set by the Village (this is also what those 'people' who 'came up to me' think homeschoolers do): shelter your children from the world completly, don't let them know about much of the sin out there, and scare them into remaining locked in this glass house for the rest of their lives.The parents of the Village should have followed the example of homeschoolers.  Yes they should have sheltered them from 'the world', but not in a falsehood: in the time tested world of a whole family.  They should have instilled in their children the strong morals neccessary to survive in the culture of death.  After doing this, the Village parents could put their children's safety completely in God's hands, as they allowed their now fully grown 'babies' to take on 'the world' one fight at a time.This is the main point that Shymalan skipped in the Village that he wisely included in Signs: Faith in God.  In the Village, he sets up a place where mortal men isolate themselves and expect to battle the sins of the entire world.  There fighting the losing battle because Satan works through man.  Satan uses the fear of the parents to overwhelm them to such a degree, that in the end it is against the sin caused by this ungodly fear that their very children have to fight.Um...so the moral of the story, kiddies: Shyamalan should get a strong Catholic like Gibson to help him with any and all of his movies.And a girl who really looks blind.In JMJ, The Prisoner",5,"""I like it very much"" - revised to two stars",1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,4104,"['daunted', 'reveiws', 'there', 'degrade', 'movie', 'please', 'read', 'am', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'fan', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'previous', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'thrilling', 'well', 'paced', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'heard', 'say', 'not', 'thrilling', 'monsters', 'looked', 'so', 'fake', 'can', 'say', 'even', 'looked', 'warthogs', 'dressed', 'up', 'bushes', 'cloaks', 'was', 'still', 'jumping', 'skin.Another', 'point', 'brought', 'up', 'movie', 'too', 'slow', 'slow', 'parts', 'did', 'not', 'equal', 'thrilling', 'parts', 'would', 'become', 'A', 'half-hour', 'Japanamation', 'flick', 'B', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'plot', 'Hence', 'slower=boring', 'not', 'interesting', 'not', 'exciting', 'faster=no', 'story', 'not', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'why', 'bother', '.I', 'was', 'willing', 'look', 'bad', 'reviews', 'have', 'found', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'determine', 'opinion', 'yourself.P.S', 'began', 'counting', 'begining', 'movie', 'lost', 'count', 'some-where', 'counted', 'least', '50', 'prepositions.REVISION', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'previous', 'feelings', 'current', 'feelings', 'go', 'show', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'better', 'theature', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'holes', 'would', 'now', 'like', 'take', 'space', 'contrast', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'culty', 'subtly', 'Catholic', 'Signs.In', 'Signs', 'main', 'conflict', 'was', 'Graham', 'God', 'simplified', 'relationship', 'Graham', 'son', 'very', 'important', 'moving', 'theme', 'todays', 'world', 'resolution', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'Village', 'main', 'conflict', 'see', 'parents', 'fears', 'fears', 'are', 'obviously', 'well', 'grounded', 'are', 'unfortunatly', 'delt', 'wrong', 'way', 'mean', 'running', 'away', 'cloistering', 'corner', 'cowering', 'FRIGHTENING', 'children', 'staying', 'away', 'real', 'world', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'sin', 'boggie', 'man', 'will', 'get', 'parents', 'take', 'opportunity', 'teach', 'children', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'TRUE', 'courage', 'then', 'out..As', 'homeschooler', 'find', 'certain', 'point', 'movie', 'very', 'important', 'make', ""'ve"", 'aqctually', 'had', 'people', 'come', 'up', 'ask', 'so', 'shelterd', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'make', ""'real"", 'world', 'people', 'Village', 'parents', 'have', 'forgotten', 'REAL', 'real', 'world', 'Heaven', 'suddenly', 'force', 'temporal', 'issues', 'fragile', 'person', 'child', 'shatter', 'hope', 'teaching', 'anything', 'life-affirming', 'other', 'hand', 'parents', 'should', ""n't"", 'follow', 'example', 'set', 'Village', 'also', 'what', ""'people"", 'who', 'up', 'think', 'homeschoolers', 'do', 'shelter', 'children', 'world', 'completly', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'know', 'about', 'much', 'sin', 'there', 'scare', 'remaining', 'locked', 'glass', 'house', 'rest', 'lives.The', 'parents', 'Village', 'should', 'have', 'followed', 'example', 'homeschoolers', 'should', 'have', 'sheltered', 'world', 'not', 'falsehood', 'time', 'tested', 'world', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'have', 'instilled', 'children', 'strong', 'morals', 'neccessary', 'survive', 'culture', 'death', 'doing', 'Village', 'parents', 'could', 'put', 'children', 'safety', 'completely', 'God', 'hands', 'allowed', 'now', 'fully', 'grown', ""'babies"", 'take', ""'the"", 'world', 'one', 'fight', 'time.This', 'main', 'point', 'Shymalan', 'skipped', 'Village', 'wisely', 'included', 'Signs', 'Faith', 'God', 'Village', 'up', 'place', 'where', 'mortal', 'men', 'isolate', 'expect', 'battle', 'sins', 'entire', 'world', 'fighting', 'losing', 'battle', 'Satan', 'man', 'Satan', 'fear', 'parents', 'overwhelm', 'such', 'degree', 'end', 'sin', 'caused', 'ungodly', 'fear', 'very', 'children', 'have', 'fight.Um', 'so', 'moral', 'story', 'kiddies', 'Shyamalan', 'should', 'get', 'strong', 'Catholic', 'Gibson', 'help', 'movies.And', 'girl', 'who', 'really', 'blind.In', 'JMJ', 'Prisoner']",N/A

He tells a masterful tale set back in the 1800s of a village who lives peacefully except for a fear of the creatures who live within the surrounding woods. When domestic animals come up slain and red marks (the forbidden color that attracts the creatures) start showing up on resident's front doors, the elders begin to wonder if the uneasy truce between them and the creatures beyond is about to be broken.This village has certainly had it's share of tragedy--from childhood deaths to patriarch Edward Walker's (William Hurt) daughter Ivy's blindness. Although Lucias Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to brave the creatures in the woods to reach a nearby town for needed medical supplies, it's Ivy Walker (played brilliantly by Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard) who becomes the true heroine. It's not only about what someone will do to save a loved one, but the true nature of a monster.I actually think this is a much better movie than 6th Sense. It's much more understated.

The film wasn't as intense as ""Signs"" and ""the six sense"" (unbreakable wasn't really intense) but this film had more dept and great cinematography, which made the film great. The acting is perfect for the mood and atmosphere, the cinematography of the village and the woods is amazing for the environment and the message is completely relevant. Virtually no special effects were used, just nothing but brilliant camera work by Shyamalan. In this film you would notice that the way the village people talk is sort of like a Shake Spear terms. Like ""how are thou?"" and terms similar to that kind of way of speaking.The basic plot of this movie is the village is overall perfect except for the fact that evil creatures surround them. When one noble man gets hurt, his fianc&eacute; must cross through the woods to the town where she can find medicine for his wounds. She has to go through hell to get her fianc&eacute; treatment. It is a brilliant movie with cameos that will definitely make you jump! The ending kind of leads to a sequel, but the success of the film will determine that, and if Shyamalan wants to make it.This film I definitely recommend to anyone who loves great movies. Approaching the end of the movie, it might get a bit confusing because flashbacks and scene switching aren't clearly obvious, but that may be for just some people. Help yourself not to miss one moment of this film because you will regret it towards the end of the film where you don't know what is going on. This is one of those films you really have to pay close attention too, or else soon after the film you won't know what is going on. That is another reason why this film is so great and brilliant.

860141,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00064LJVE,Nicholas Carroll,"[5, 5]","Yes, this film is manipulative and at the end you feel like you've been deceived, that the director pulled a fast one on you and sold a completely different film in the movie trailers than the one you just watched, and that is the brilliant point of this film.  We are meant to be angered by the ending, to be mad that our expectations were played with and that we ultimately feel silly for getting scared in the beginning.  The point of this film is that there is nothing to be afraid of, that some people use fear as a controlling device to keep us in our place, and once we learn more or discover the world for ourselves, its not so scary after all.  Ignorance breeds fear, knowledge gives power.The stand out performance in this film is Bryce Dallas Howard, who is simply phenomenal as a blind girl who must brave the dangerous woods to get medicine from the outside world and save the man she loves.  This is her first major film role and I'm glad that M Night Shyamalan takes risks like that, allowing unknown actors to carry a film, and Howard does it brilliantly.  I look forward to seeing her in more films.  The other performance I enjoyed is Joaquin Phoenix, who has a larger role in this one than he did in ""Signs"".  He plays a sharp and curious young man who makes repeated requests to leave the village to find out what's out there.  The village elders know that he's a handful and that his bravery surpasses that of everyone else in the Village.The only unfortunate aspect of a Shyamalan film is that it now completely rests on the surprise twist or two at the end...which people actually sit through the film and try to predict the ending instead of enjoying the film without expectations of where it will go.  When I saw this in the theaters last summer, I could tell by the audience reaction that they were disappointed at the ending, but I sensed that most people missed the point entirely.  This film, more than ""Manchurian Candidate"", touches the current political nature of our country about how fear is being managed by our administration.  Just a few weeks before election day, ads came out featuring wolves to knock the Democrats as too weak to protect us, but my guess is that they never saw this film.  Its not the wolves we need to fear, but the elders who attempt to instill the fear in us so we won't discover the truth for ourselves.  See this film, see it for the allegory it is and don't try to guess the ending if you haven't seen it yet.  There is nothing to be afraid of, except our own fears.  This is worth owning on DVD and out of Shyamalan's four ""supernatural films"", I like this one second (after ""The Sixth Sense"" and before ""Signs"").  I hope for Shyamalan's sake that he surprises us all with his next film, by making it a straight-forward film without twists and surprises.

860142,A3713PP4MADKED,B00064LJVE,"Nick Watkins ""Nick Watkins""","[0, 3]","I expected this to be another horrifying Shymalan flick, but it wasn't quite. The beginning of the flick up to about 50 minutes, there's a great plot going about an apparently 19th-century village living in fear of the creatures that live in the woods. The hauntin atmosphere is set my a lot of silence, slow-moving (but appropriately) scenes and the paranoia of what's in the woods that stays inside all the villagers. I must confess, when the &quot;creatures&quot; came out of the woods and ran by underneath the watch-out tower and left red marks on all the doors that I was quite scared.Also, in the first 50 minutes, a romance develops between a blind village girl named Ivy and a overly shy and quiet town boy (played by Phoenix, I believe his second time in a Shymalan film). The romance almost seems like a side-plot, but it eventually becomes major matter.If you don't want to hear a small spoiler, don't read this paragraph. There is also a mentally challened (I think that's what he ways) man played amazingly by Adrien Brody who later, for no apparent reason, kills Phoenix's character right after he and Ivy agree to get married. Ivy knows that there is another town on the other side of the woods with medicine to cure the infectious stab wounds Phoenix received, so she asks her father for permission to go through the woods, even though filled with &quot;creatures&quot; and go to the next town for the one she loves.That's where the plot takes a major twist.A lot of the movie actually ends up focusing on the relationship between Phoenix & Ivy, but that's necessary because it shows you the love they have for each other and eventually makes it more believable that Ivy would go to great lengths such as this to heal Phoenix.I won't say just what happens, but it is a bit of a disappointment. I wish they just stayed with the original plot and worked with that, but it wasn't a total let-down. Even though it wasn't very scary after you realize what's really going on, it's still just as entertaining and still want to see what happens.

The story is engaging, the cinematography top notch, the acting very well done, it has the best score of any movie released this year, and it has what is--hands down--the best scene of the year.So what if Mr. Shyamalan has a fixation on that ending twist? So what is this was the weakest twist yet? It's all about the journey people--not the pay off.The most arresting quality of this movie is its beauty. The contrast between the environment in which the villagers live--the drab village (no red allowed) and the stunning vibrance of the surrounding fields and woods serves as swirling canvas for the story to then be painted on. The bold colors of the robes they wear almost palpably call for the younger generation to explore what lies beyond.The score works hand-in-hand with the visuals, with the natural sounds of branches clacking in the breeze, to cast an eerie pall over the whole movie. An aside: the DVD title page has to be one of the best out there. I usually get to hear these things a few times through waiting for my ADD wife to get situated--this one is first rate.Let's talk acting:This cast, from top to bottom does an excellent job. Joaquin Phoenix (could he be M. Night's Jimmy Stewart?) hands in another great performance. Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are both great in their understated ways.And...Good God, where did they find Bryce Dallas Howard? I haven't been blown away by an actress like this since I saw Kate Blanchett in Elizabeth. There are so many scenes that almost make this movie great--and all but one of them is because she is involved.Speaking of those scenes: the stabbing and the conversation while sitting on the rocks come in close seconds, but the greatest scene of the movie, and of 2004 if you ask me, is the conversation between Lucius and Ivy on Ivy's porch. Joaquin Phoenix gets to speak words that will ring true to any man whose ever been in love. Meanwhile, their words literally hang in the air.The Village is a strong movie. It is what it is.

I was familiar with few of the actors but they all did a fine job and the casting was absolutely perfect. You won't sleep through this one!The film yields a unique, fantastical story and I found it to be infinitely refreshing to say the least. It's all about a sect of devoutly religious people who appear to have migrated to a secret wilderness location where they remain insulated from and uninfluenced by outside (western culture) stimuli. And there is some sort of dreaded ""monster"" which both keeps out intruders and equally maintains security to the degree that residents can never venture out.... but venturing out for help becomes medically necessary.Both the script and superb cinematography of this film are just superb. The color saturation is tremendous and the sets and locations are near perfection.

This was no fault of the  excellent casts and the  artistic cinematography. The projection of an almost Amish like  isolated  Victorian era village  community  was very well -handled. As at least one other reviewer has written, the damp  leafless November woods and mists lend as eeriness  most suitable to the setting of the story. However, the story line itself is fatally flawed. The ending could have been saved had a better extra twist been added than the one we are shown. I do not want to  include any spoilers here. In fact  part of my problem is that I learnt too much about the movie before I watched it. Inevitably when there are so many dismal  film works shown  indiscriminately on TV channels one resorts to site such as  Amazon or IMdB for some sense of whether a  film  to be screened on TV is worth watching  or taping.I am very fond of what might be called ""twilight  zone"" genre films  despite the fact that so few of this kind are successful. It is probably one of the most challenging film script genres to write. So I would have  incorporated and expanded the feeble attempt at an extra twist right at the end of the film of a kind that  would have  strengthened the predictable and not very  impressive main twist with a less predictable ending. This is not a movie that most people might enjoy, even if it were improved by such suitable amendments and additions that might occur at some time in the future, but for  a minority it is an extremely well done if not a perfectly finished work of art.

The spooky trailer that I had viewed prior to the film's release, painted a picture of an eerie story mixing elements of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Howling"" about a mid-nineteenth century community being terrorised by evil beasts lurking in the neighbouring woods. And based on M. Night Shyamalan's track record of scripting solid thrillers, who were we to suspect anything different ?OK...if you haven't yet seen ""The Village"", then here's your chance to stop reading before I give away the entire plot of this movie !Instead, current Hollywood whiz kid, M. Night Shyamalan feeds movie audiences an unbelievable story about a group of New Yorkers who have all suffered personal tragedies (partners murdered, business went broke etc), so they have headed off into an enormous walled forest reserve to create their own secluded Amish style community and to pretend they are living in the late 1890's ! And to keep anyone from leaving their little slice of man made Shangri-La, the village ""elders"" have concocted and maintained some superstitious gibberish about monsters lurking in the woods surrounding their small hamlet !And movie audiences are meant to swallow that in the two or three decades that the group have been in this reserve, that no park ranger has ever come across them or seen their nightly ring of fires, and that no aircraft has ever flown over the reserve, and that no one from the community has challenged the superstition and has headed out through the woods to discover the modern world, or even that one of the young men in the village hasn't tried to KO one of the beasts ( the village elders dressed up as werewolves ) with a good lump of timber ???Crikey....give audiences some credit for having better intelligence.If I wanted to watch a film about a utopian community, then I would have watched Frank Capra's classic ""Lost Horizon"", and if I wanted to watch a thrilling horror fantasy picture, then I would have selected ""In the Company of Wolves"".......however, ""The Village"" is masquerading as both, and fails as both. Ultimately, it is simply a love story between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix, clouded with a huge amount of false horror distractions, and an overlong running time.The DVD release contains a handful of tepid extras about how Wiliam Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and their fellow actors learnt what it was like to live in nineteenth century New England, plus some other ""behind the scenes"" footage on churning butter and cutting down trees that is mind numbingly dull !Suitable viewing for curiosity's sake only.",1,"Should be called ""Dances with Fake Wolves"" !!",1108339200,"02 14, 2005",2005,2646,"['Gee', 'felt', 'cheated', 'watching', 'sheep', 'wolf', 'clothing', 'movie', 'spooky', 'trailer', 'had', 'viewed', 'prior', 'film', 'release', 'painted', 'picture', 'eerie', 'story', 'mixing', 'elements', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Howling', 'mid-nineteenth', 'century', 'community', 'being', 'terrorised', 'evil', 'beasts', 'lurking', 'neighbouring', 'woods', 'based', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'track', 'record', 'scripting', 'solid', 'thrillers', 'who', 'were', 'suspect', 'anything', 'different', 'OK', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'Village', 'then', 'here', 'chance', 'stop', 'reading', 'give', 'away', 'entire', 'plot', 'movie', 'Instead', 'current', 'Hollywood', 'whiz', 'kid', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'audiences', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'group', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'partners', 'murdered', 'business', 'went', 'broke', 'etc', 'have', 'headed', 'off', 'enormous', 'walled', 'forest', 'reserve', 'create', 'own', 'secluded', 'Amish', 'style', 'community', 'pretend', 'are', 'living', 'late', '1890', 'keep', 'anyone', 'leaving', 'little', 'slice', 'man', 'made', 'Shangri-La', 'village', 'elders', 'have', 'concocted', 'maintained', 'superstitious', 'gibberish', 'monsters', 'lurking', 'woods', 'surrounding', 'small', 'hamlet', 'movie', 'audiences', 'are', 'meant', 'swallow', 'two', 'three', 'decades', 'group', 'have', 'been', 'reserve', 'park', 'ranger', 'ever', 'come', 'seen', 'nightly', 'ring', 'fires', 'aircraft', 'ever', 'flown', 'reserve', 'one', 'community', 'challenged', 'superstition', 'headed', 'out', 'woods', 'discover', 'modern', 'world', 'even', 'one', 'young', 'men', 'village', ""n't"", 'tried', 'KO', 'one', 'beasts', 'village', 'elders', 'dressed', 'up', 'werewolves', 'good', 'lump', 'timber', 'Crikey', '.give', 'audiences', 'credit', 'having', 'better', 'intelligence.If', 'wanted', 'watch', 'film', 'utopian', 'community', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'classic', 'Lost', 'Horizon', 'wanted', 'watch', 'thrilling', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'picture', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'selected', 'Company', 'Wolves', '.however', 'Village', 'masquerading', 'Ultimately', 'simply', 'love', 'story', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'clouded', 'huge', 'amount', 'false', 'horror', 'distractions', 'overlong', 'running', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'handful', 'tepid', 'extras', 'how', 'Wiliam', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'fellow', 'actors', 'learnt', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'New', 'England', 'other', 'scenes', 'footage', 'churning', 'butter', 'cutting', 'down', 'trees', 'mind', 'numbingly', 'dull', 'Suitable', 'viewing', 'curiosity', 'sake', 'only']",N/A

I really thought this movie was going to make up for the horrible Mel Gibson movie Signs, but Village loses it by the ending too.

Brody, who plays a half-wit, comes off more annoying than retarded and almost leaves you longing for the guy that played the retarded character in Gigli (and I don't mean Ben Affleck).

Critics had panned THE VILLAGE but considering his track record, I decided to give this work a chance.Regarding the big 'surprise ending,' I more-or-less had it figured out halfway through as, apparently did many viewers.  In any event, it wasn't much of a revelation and it isn't much of a Village either.Imagine a community that appears to have no contact with the outside world and be totally, totally agrarian.  Yet it has bone china, paper, kerosene, ink, pneumatically-carved tombstones, and every metal tool imaginable (and with no warehouses).  The credibility is stretched and broken within moments.But, were you to suspend disbelief and just go with the one-note plotline about needing to pass through a monster-laden forest and get medicine, you'd still have to endure the badly stilted dialogue, glacial pace, and acting so understated that it made narcoleptics seem like crazed caffeine fiends.Yes, the film has strengths.  Somehow, the Village elder played by William Hurt is engaging.

I expected a horror/sci fi thriller like M.Night Shyamalan's &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;Signs&quot;.Instead, I found one of the most captivating lovestories I've ever viewed. Before I go any further, Imust say that if any of you are trueromantics...like thought-provoking love stories...thenyou will undoubtedly place &quot;the porch scene&quot; in yourmental scrapbook of memorable love scenes. If thisone doesn't have Academy written all over it, nothingdoes. This is by far the best directed, scripted andedited film I've seen in a long, long time. BryceDallas Howard as Ivy is one of the most convincingperformances on record. I went with my son and hisgirlfriend. She walks out of the theatre saying, &quot;AmI a total girl or what? I cried through the wholemovie.&quot; I walked up to her and said, &quot;don't feel bad,I did, too&quot;. Bryce deserves to be in the running forBest Actress come March. And, Adrien Brody'sportrayal of Noah should garner a Supporting Actornod. Add to that Joaquin Phoenix (starred in&quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Signs&quot;) as Lucius, Sigourney Weaveras Alice Hunt, and William Hurt as Edward Walker.Shyamalan's casting is superb. The script is nearperfect. It's a film where words play a much greaterrole than sound effects and costumes. As you know, Inever give away a plot. I definitely can't with thisone. The twists are intertwined at moments when youthink you just figured out the stunning ending. I'llbe one of the first in line to buy the DVD...even ifit's just for &quot;the porch scene&quot;. And...I would beremiss if I didn't add that this flick may also get aBest Film nomination. On a scale of 1-10 (10 beingthe highest), &quot;The Village&quot; gets an 11 in what has tobe a new genre'.

860167,AR62AZIQLYARV,B00064LJVE,Quinn Noble,"[8, 9]","--Spoiler alert--The titular village is a 19th-century hamlet hidden in the woods. The surrounding forest is inhabited by mysterious, dangerous creatures, referred to only in hushed tones as ""Those We Don't Speak Of""; venturing into their domain is forbidden, lest the uneasy peace between the townsfolk and their unhuman neighbors be broken.As usual, Shyamalan takes his time setting up the story. We watch the quiet daily life of the village: their meals, their labors, their everyday conversations. We are introduced to Ivy, Lucius, and Noah, three young people who will play a central role in the drama. Lucius is utterly fearless, and wishes to enter the woods despite the ban. Ivy, though blind, is resourceful and capable. She is the caretaker of Noah, the village madman, and seems to be the only one who can calm him. Gradually we discover that the town elders are all concealing a secret sorrow, and begin to wonder what it is. As Lucius becomes bolder about wandering into the woods, the creatures begin making more aggressive overtures: skinned animals, marks on doors, culminating with an incursion into the town. By the time one of the villagers is forced to journey into the woods, we are completely absorbed--and this is only the midpoint of the movie. In the end, when the full truth behind the village is revealed, we are forced to reflect on the lengths to which we go to keep our loved ones safe from danger, the cost to them of doing so, and the inevitable loss of innocence that accompanies growing up. When will the younger villagers discover the secret? What will happen to them when they do? Was the way of life the elders established ever worth the sacrifices they made, now that the violence they hoped to escape has broken out in their midst? The movie refuses to answer these questions, instead leaving us to grapple with them.This is one of Shyamalan's best movies, surpassed only by Unbreakable.

True, it is nothing like his previous works such as ""Signs"" and the ""Sixth Sense"", but nevertheless it is very entertaining.The story revolves around the citizens living in a tranquil village, surrounded by woods. They lead a calm and peaceful life, not bothered with the outside world and content with what they have. However, dark and mysterious creatures live in the surrounding woods that the villages are terrified of. The villagers and the creatures of the woods have made a truce as to never set foot on each other's settings. However, things change when Ivy Walker, a blind woman, has to cross the woods to get medicine, in order to save the man that she loves. What follows is a series of happenings that makes `The Village' so entertaining to watch.Many critics have slaughtered the reviews for this movie because they keep fixating on the level of intensity and spooks that this movie gives. True, this is a mysterious, eerie movie, but just because it is, doesn't mean we have to expect ghosts and goblins to pop out of no reason. It is more of an intellectual movie and talks a lot about human nature, about how safe we really are, even if we try our best to prevent all dangers from taking place. In a way, this movie makes a lot of sense, especially in the end, when you think about it and say `Ok, that's why the color red was not allowed in the village' and things like that.Bryce Dallas Howard, who played the role of Ivy, did a tremendous job for her role and should definitely be nominated for an award. She conveys her feeling beautifully in each scene and shines throughout the movie. The rest of the actors, Adrien Brody, Joaquin Phoenix, Judy Greer all played their parts well, even though there wasn't too much of it.This movie is not that scary, but it does have a lot of twists to it, which you don't expect coming.

This movie is a rather slow-moving period piece that tells the tale of a remote village surrounded by Coventry Wood: and creatures so terrible they are referred to only as &quot;those of whom we do not speak&quot;. The creatures are attracted to the color red (blood), simply called &quot;the bad color,&quot; and boundaries are set up all around the perimeter of the village, in hopes of keeping them out.A long-standing truce between the villagers and the creatures of the wood is in danger of being broken when one of the villagers dares to cross the boundaries and angers them. When the villagers find dead, skinned animals strewn about and awake to red slashes in blood across their doors, they are afraid of what may come. Tragedy through violence again strikes the little village, and one of the villagers will be tempted to cross the yellow boundaries into the wood to travel to ""the towns"" to retrieve help: but doing this may bring consequences unlike any they have ever known...For those of you worried about content: there are some intense moments, lots of suspense, but surprisingly little objectionable content. This movie is not a gory horror flick, but rather tame in that aspect: there are dead, skinned & bloody animals strewn about, some violence and blood, and very little language to speak of. The scary and adult themes of this film make it unfit for young children, but the content is actually quite clean.This film was well-acted, with stellar performances by Adrien Brody, Joaquin Phoenix, and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard.

Some questions (which will not give away the silly ending) You mean this is the FIRST time that someone in this village was in desperate need of medical attention?  If they are limited to living within the clearing from the woods, how do they get more wood and firewood?

Clearly, the man has oodles of talent, and possesses the happy knack of being able to exact wonderfully original performances from the big stars that want to do his movies. On paper, then, The Village, should have been an excellent film, with its compelling pseudo-horror premise, a cast roster with talented names like John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Joaquin Phoenix, and M. Night Shyamalan directing his own screenplay.However.It is said that somewhere between truth and untruth lies fiction. It could be said that somewhere between bad and reprehensible lies The Village. I have never seen such a promising movie deliver so very little - and, even more annoyingly - deliver it so sloppily.The first and most disheartening problem with this picture is the direction. M. Night Shyamalan appears to be going for the 'glossy TV Series' feel, as opposed to anything atmospheric or real. For a town of pilgrims, the inhabitants of The VIllage seem to live in cleanliness and harmony. While this does have a bearing on the ending, for the most part of the movie, the plastic-fantastic semi-real visuals and frankly standard-fare camerawork negate any sense of isolation or pilgrimage that we might have felt (and, I am sure, Shyamalan intends us to feel) for the protagonists. We see monsters in most of their glory far too early on, and where this has worked before (the little girl ghost in The Sixth Sense), it fails here since the mosnters are specifically designed with some kind of revolting knock-off Tolkien Orc template in mind. The look like the Trolls in 'Willow', except more comical. And in a movie of this nature (where the unseen and undiscussed is the source of all the tension) that's a bad thing.Performances are humdrum at best (Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard) and, at worst, stereotyped and banal (Brendan Gleeson and Adrien Brody, who looks like he's making fun as opposed to having fun). Bryce Dallas Howard is passable - almost good - as Ivy, and saves this movie from a one-star rating, but she's just not believable as blind. Weaver and Hurt are totally wasted with a lousy, lousy script that contains no life or characterisation, and the tone of the cast in general matches that of the picture as a whole - kind of lifeless.And that, coupled with the fact that M. Night Shyamalan seems to be in love with his own image here (I can't tell you how the script may have benefitted from a couple more rewrites, ditto the direction - I guess he just doesn't think he can do any wrong!) means that, far from being the suspenseful and beautifully-shot movie that has become M. Night Shyamalan's trademark, it falls very far and very flat on its dull, predictable face.One to avoid at all costs, rent ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"" instead.",2,"Pointless, excessive in all the wrong places",1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2820,"[""'m"", 'big', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'fan', 'Who', ""n't"", 'Clearly', 'man', 'oodles', 'talent', 'happy', 'knack', 'being', 'able', 'exact', 'wonderfully', 'original', 'performances', 'big', 'stars', 'want', 'do', 'movies', 'paper', 'then', 'Village', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'film', 'compelling', 'pseudo-horror', 'premise', 'cast', 'roster', 'talented', 'names', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'directing', 'own', 'screenplay.However.It', 'said', 'somewhere', 'truth', 'untruth', 'lies', 'fiction', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'somewhere', 'bad', 'reprehensible', 'Village', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'promising', 'movie', 'deliver', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'even', 'more', 'annoyingly', 'deliver', 'so', 'sloppily.The', 'first', 'most', 'disheartening', 'problem', 'picture', 'direction', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'be', 'going', ""'glossy"", 'TV', 'Series', 'feel', 'opposed', 'anything', 'atmospheric', 'real', 'town', 'pilgrims', 'inhabitants', 'VIllage', 'seem', 'live', 'cleanliness', 'harmony', 'have', 'bearing', 'ending', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'plastic-fantastic', 'semi-real', 'visuals', 'frankly', 'standard-fare', 'camerawork', 'negate', 'sense', 'isolation', 'pilgrimage', 'might', 'have', 'felt', 'am', 'sure', 'Shyamalan', 'feel', 'protagonists', 'see', 'monsters', 'most', 'glory', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'where', 'worked', 'little', 'girl', 'ghost', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'here', 'mosnters', 'are', 'specifically', 'designed', 'kind', 'revolting', 'knock-off', 'Tolkien', 'Orc', 'template', 'mind', 'look', 'Trolls', ""'Willow"", 'more', 'comical', 'movie', 'nature', 'where', 'unseen', 'undiscussed', 'source', 'tension', 'bad', 'thing.Performances', 'are', 'humdrum', 'best', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'worst', 'stereotyped', 'banal', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'who', 'making', 'fun', 'opposed', 'having', 'fun', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'passable', 'almost', 'good', 'Ivy', 'movie', 'one-star', 'rating', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'blind', 'Weaver', 'Hurt', 'are', 'totally', 'wasted', 'lousy', 'lousy', 'script', 'life', 'characterisation', 'tone', 'cast', 'general', 'matches', 'picture', 'whole', 'kind', 'lifeless.And', 'coupled', 'fact', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'be', 'love', 'own', 'image', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'script', 'may', 'have', 'benefitted', 'couple', 'more', 'rewrites', 'direction', 'guess', 'just', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'far', 'being', 'suspenseful', 'beautifully-shot', 'movie', 'become', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'trademark', 'very', 'far', 'very', 'flat', 'dull', 'predictable', 'face.One', 'avoid', 'costs', 'rent', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs', 'instead']",N/A

860180,A7YRIAR531O83,B00064LJVE,Rick Chen,"[14, 20]","Despite promising trailers, this movie fails to deliver the fear factor. I would not classify this movie as horror. Rather, as a mixture across genres. It is a drama, not horror as the trailers might mislead you to think -a thriller at most. If you are looking for a scary horror flick, look elsewhere.The movie is not as visually disturbing as you might expect. In fact, save for one or two shots, the semi-eerie music in the background is the best attempt by the movie to leave the audience with any after effects.I was hoping to see a M. Night Shyamalan movie that will impress me as the 6th sense once did. His subsequent films after the 6th sense just didn't seem to leave the same aftertaste. I faced disappointment after disappointment (Unbreakable, Signs,...) and now I barely taste anything at all after seeing the Village. It was as if Shyamalan has lost his flavor.I recall I was not impressed when I saw those aliens in the conclusion of Signs, but now these red cloaked 'creatures' with claws in The Village look waaaaaay too artificial -rather than superficial, as they were portrayed to be in the movie.I did not feel any chemistry build up, as I had intensely felt for Shyamalan's previous movies. The scenes just didn't flow for me. Rather than a smooth transition from scene to scene, it felt like a collage of scene snippets shown one after another while maintaining sequence. In fact, I found that some parts of the movie were pointless and unnecessary. What is the purpose of introducing the possibility of a romance between Edward Walker and Alice Hunt that doesn't end up going anywhere?Throughout the movie, the theater occasionally filled with laughter. Near the beginning of the movie, I was thinking: 'would these high school kids just cut it out? It's supposed to be a horror movie. If you need to calm yourself to relieve your fear by laughing it off then you shouldn't be watching in the first place'. However, as the movie wore on, I couldn't help but join in myself, as some scenes turned out to prompt for laughter despite the movie's solemn theme.It is a shame that the 109 minutes had to be split in n-ways amongst such a classy cast consisting of: William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody, Joaquin Phoenix... Save for Bryce Dallas Howard, this movie barely gave any of them a chance to warm up, let alone deliver a star performance. Until about halfway into the movie, you really can't pinpoint exactly who the main character is. This is perhaps the reason why this movie does not move you in the same way as Shyamalan's previous movies, where the audience bonds with the main character (eg. Bruce Willis in 6th sense/Unbreakable, Mel Gibson in Signs) right away and gets absorbed into the plot. The only thing that can possibly salvage this movie is Bryce Dallas Howard's convincing performance as Ivy Walker, a blind young woman that was somehow able to 'see' colours in people.The scenes inside the forest reminded me of the Blair Witch Project -one of the worst movies I have ever seen. At the end of the movie, I was asking myself, which was worse? The Village or the Blair Witch Project? The Village is better, but not by much. The ending might seem intelligent to some, but to me, it is not at all surprising. It was just another Ah-huh to go along with the rest of the movie.If someone dares you to watch it in hopes to give you nightmares, dare them back not to laugh during the movie.",2,I see no colours at all...

The villagers grow their own food, make their own clothes, and make no contact with the towns beyond the wood. It is a sanctuary of innocence, kept away from the sinful settlers of the outside world.But not all is bliss. Sickness, injury, and then death comes every so often, with those in the village unable to treat the ailments, because they have no medicines. And they do not venture to the towns, for fear of terrible creatures that live in the wood. They have numerous safeguards against these beings. They have flags of the `safe color' (a dark yellow) surrounding the clearing, and those who watch its border wear the same color. They shun everything of the `bad color' (red), burying even flowers that bear the hue, knowing that this color attracts the creatures.  As long as no human enters the wood, the creatures do not enter the clearing. But if someone crosses the border, the fearsome, flesh-eating brutes do the same. Yet some people, as more die for lack of treatments, determine to brave the woods and gather medicines from the towns.This is, in my opinion, one of the great films of our time. I can see that many here at Amazon do not agree, but I do not understand their sentiments. The Village is of high-quality in all respects, with excellent music, cinematography, acting, storytelling, and directing. It is a unique, touching film of love and bravery, and the battle to keep a people innocent.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:",5,'Those we do not speak of...',1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,1561,"['film', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'peaceful', 'village', 'clearing', 'middle', 'great', 'wood', 'villagers', 'grow', 'own', 'food', 'make', 'own', 'clothes', 'make', 'contact', 'towns', 'wood', 'sanctuary', 'innocence', 'kept', 'away', 'sinful', 'settlers', 'outside', 'world.But', 'not', 'bliss', 'Sickness', 'injury', 'then', 'death', 'so', 'often', 'village', 'unable', 'treat', 'ailments', 'have', 'medicines', 'do', 'not', 'venture', 'towns', 'fear', 'terrible', 'creatures', 'live', 'wood', 'have', 'numerous', 'safeguards', 'beings', 'have', 'flags', 'safe', 'color', 'dark', 'yellow', 'surrounding', 'clearing', 'who', 'watch', 'border', 'same', 'color', 'shun', 'everything', 'bad', 'color', 'red', 'burying', 'even', 'flowers', 'bear', 'hue', 'knowing', 'color', 'creatures', 'As', 'long', 'human', 'wood', 'creatures', 'do', 'not', 'enter', 'clearing', 'someone', 'border', 'fearsome', 'flesh-eating', 'brutes', 'do', 'same', 'people', 'more', 'die', 'lack', 'treatments', 'determine', 'brave', 'woods', 'gather', 'medicines', 'towns.This', 'opinion', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'many', 'here', 'Amazon', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'sentiments', 'Village', 'high-quality', 'respects', 'excellent', 'music', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'storytelling', 'directing', 'unique', 'touching', 'film', 'love', 'bravery', 'battle', 'keep', 'people', 'innocent.Ryan', 'RobledoAuthor', 'Aelnathan']",N/A
860185,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00064LJVE,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[46, 51]","I think two factors are behind the bulk of negative reviews for ""The Village"": one, it's fairly obvious that M. Night Shymalan has gone into the well a few too many times in regard to his Big Twist plot scenario, and two, the film was wrongly advertised as a horror movie.Perhaps my knowledge of these two facts was what let me enjoy the movie on a level that other people haven't; watching it as a dark fairy tale, a critique on today's contemporary situation, a beautiful love story, and a chilling suspense mystery. With gorgeous visuals, fantastic use of colour and a haunting violinist score, ""The Village"" is certainly a feast for the senses, whatever you might think of the actual story.In an idyllic, peaceful clearing is a hamlet where children play together, adults work together, and which is benevolently ruled over by a group of Elders. Amongst them is Edward Walker, the village patriarch and school-teacher, widowed Alice Hunt, and bereaved father August Nicolson, who has just lost his son to illness.The second generation is represented mainly through Edward's two daughters, the giddy Kitty, and the blind, spiritual Ivy, and Alice's son Lucius - a near-mute introvert who never speaks more than five words strung together unless he's carefully written out what he wants to say on a piece of paper. As well as this, there's Noah Percy, a mentally challenged young man who adores Ivy, and is consequently hurt and confused by her growing feelings for Lucius.The village is surrounded by Covington Woods, and here is where the real chills are to be found. Inside these woods dwell what the villagers call ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", strange and menacing monsters that stand between the village and the outside towns. Not that this is a bad thing, as we are told that the towns are ""wicked places, full of wicked people"". Despite this, it is important that the villagers uphold the uneasy truce between the woods and their community. A series of defences are in place to keep the creatures at bay: watchtowers, warning bells, offerings, cloaks of ""the safe colour"" and a restriction against anything that is red - this apparently attracts them. And no one is *ever* to go into the woods.But of course, we all know that anything forbidden is instantly fascinating, and that teenagers are almost genetically engineered to test the boundaries put in place around them. Therefore, whilst the other boys are playing ""chicken"" games at the edge of the woods, Lucius is exploring his own theory concerning the creatures: he is greatly affected by the death August's son, and believes that if the traveller had noble intentions (such as fetching medicines from the towns), the creatures would let him pass unharmed.But as he puts this to the test, the threat from the creatures grow - skinned animals and red marks appear on the doors. Coincidence? No way. Rules are continually broken, and lines continually crossed throughout the story - even the angelic Ivy breaks her ""no hitting"" rule. Finally Lucius (and the rest of the youths) seem frightened enough to no longer attempt passage through the woods, until an accident occurs that forces a drastic decision to be made. Now Ivy must go through the terrible woods, in order to save the life of her beloved...I know that the illogical plot-holes are so gaping that you could drive a truck through them, and I know that there are some serious problems with the final resolution, but there comes a point when you make a decision - to either go with it, or scoff at it. Most people it seems have taken the second option, and unfortunately they miss out on a lot of what the director is trying to tell us about fear, authority, rules, innocence and control - all of which have particular resonance in today's world. Whether you liked it or not, please ask yourself this: where does the real danger lie - in the woods, in the towns, or in the village itself? Are some of the choices made justified? Is retaining innocence worth the terror that goes with it?As well as this, there are a lot of things to enjoy; the afore mentioned atmosphere, and the genuine scares that Shymalan throws in (at one particularly harrowing moment three girls behind me in the theatre screamed - and I mean really *screamed*). Most touching for me however, was the love story between Ivy and Lucius - every time she puts her hand out, he's there to take it, and their discussion on the porch is beautifully performed and shot: the silent Lucius suddenly blurts out what's on his mind, whilst the talkative Ivy is struck dumb.There are some things however, that stopped me from giving it five stars, the biggest one being the sudden veer away from Lucius's plot development. Shymalan builds an interesting and endearing character, and then he abruptly drops from the action, never to return. This obviously had to happen in order to get Ivy into the woods, but we never *return* to his story. Ivy learnt some truths on her journey that she'll undoubtably share with him, but we never see how he'll react to them. For that matter, we never actually learn if Ivy was actually *successful* in her mission - does he survive or not?All in all, I enjoyed ""The Village"", and I really hope you take the time to look deeper into what it's trying to say. Everything, from the colours invoked (red, the colour of violence to yellow, the colour of cowardice) to the poetic flow of the language - which is perhaps *meant* to be a little stiff, is there for a reason. Some great performances from the actors involved, and meticulous direction and control from Shymalan - I'm definitely getting this on DVD.",4,"""Let Her Go...Ivy Runs Toward Hope...""",1095724800,"09

860187,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,B00064LJVE,Robert Amsel,"[3, 13]","M. Night Shyamalan's movies are noted for their surprise endings, but in this instance, the writer-director cheats the moviegoer bigtime.  The story concerns a cult of people who have formed a village in an isolated rural area to separate themselves from an outside world where evil is rampant, not unlike Brigadoon. We are led to believe both by the villagers' clothes and by dates on local cemetery tombstones (a cemetery which in itself becomes suspect or incredible when we learn the elders' real secrets) that the story is set around the turn of the century.The real cheating, though, comes from the dialogue Night has written. It is so arch and unnatural that it would not be out of place in some 1950's Hollywood biblical or medieval epic. Fortunately, Night has a highly talented cast to try to make his odd sentence structures seem natural, even if the cast doesn't altogether succeed.The point of this stilted dialogue is to further mislead us into believing that we are dealing with some long-ago place and time. (Second-time viewers should listen very carefully, not to what is being said but to HOW it is being said.)The movie has other mysteries revealed regarding alleged flesh-eating monsters who live outside the village confines and who keep the youngsters fearful from exploring the outside world, thus keeping the village intact.Some of the romantic entanglements and subsequent jealousies are interesting, particularly one that leads to an attempted murder. Night's suggestion here (and rightly so) is that one cannot really isolate oneself from evil, since evil is unfortunately part of the human condition. Thus, ""The Village"" does at least provide some food for thought.",2,Dishonest at the Core,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,1694,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'movies', 'are', 'noted', 'surprise', 'endings', 'instance', 'writer-director', 'moviegoer', 'bigtime', 'story', 'cult', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'formed', 'village', 'isolated', 'rural', 'area', 'separate', 'outside', 'world', 'where', 'evil', 'rampant', 'not', 'Brigadoon', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'villagers', 'clothes', 'dates', 'local', 'cemetery', 'tombstones', 'cemetery', 'suspect', 'incredible', 'when', 'learn', 'elders', 'real', 'secrets', 'story', 'set', 'turn', 'century.The', 'real', 'cheating', 'dialogue', 'Night', 'written', 'so', 'arch', 'unnatural', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'place', '1950', 'Hollywood', 'biblical', 'medieval', 'epic', 'Fortunately', 'Night', 'highly', 'talented', 'cast', 'try', 'make', 'odd', 'sentence', 'structures', 'seem', 'natural', 'even', 'cast', ""n't"", 'altogether', 'succeed.The', 'point', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'further', 'mislead', 'believing', 'are', 'dealing', 'long-ago', 'place', 'time', 'Second-time', 'viewers', 'should', 'listen', 'very', 'carefully', 'not', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'HOW', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'other', 'mysteries', 'revealed', 'regarding', 'alleged', 'flesh-eating', 'monsters', 'who', 'live', 'village', 'confines', 'who', 'keep', 'youngsters', 'fearful', 'exploring', 'outside', 'world', 'thus', 'keeping', 'village', 'intact.Some', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'subsequent', 'jealousies', 'are', 'interesting', 'particularly', 'one', 'attempted', 'murder', 'Night', 'suggestion', 'here', 'rightly', 'so', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'isolate', 'evil', 'evil', 'unfortunately', 'part', 'human', 'condition', 'Thus', 'Village', 'least', 'provide', 'food', 'thought']",N/A
860188,A38XHXKPDKHP8N,B00064LJVE,Robert Anderson,"[1, 3]","If you're looking for a scary, monster movie or a horror movie with lots of action and blood, - this ain't it. It's 90% period-piece drama and 10% monster movie. In that sense it was mis-marketed.Nevertheless, I liked the movie for what it was - a suspenseful period-piece drama with a symbolic message of sorts.The story is about a 19th century puritan-style community living, isolated in a village. They live in a low-level but constant fear of the creatures who live in the surrounding woods.The DVD comes with about an hours worth of extra features - 4 deleted scenes, the director explaining the making of the movie, interviews with the actors, etc. I wish there would have been a segment in which M. Night S. discussed the symbolic meaning in his tale, but alas - no such discussion is given.** Attention: Spoilers - don't read further if you don't want to know the plot twist and the ending! **What I liked most was that this story was a superb portrayal of how those in power use fear to control the masses. In the story, it turns out that the leaders of the village simply made up the monsters as a hoax to keep the people from daring to go through the woods. All so that the outside world wouldn't taint their idyllic lifestyle. The leaders began with good intentions, but ultimately the entire life of the town was built on a lie. In the end, one of their own residents turns ""evil"", as if to show that evil is not something that is outside of us but rather the capacity for evil follows us wherever we go.The parallel, in our society of course, is how political and religious leaders similarly use fear (of terrorists, hell, etc.) to keep us in line - usually with good intentions and ""for our own good"", but often based on lies (Iraq WMDs, Iraq tied to 9/11, etc.).If one were to look at this movie from a psychological standpoint you could say that the town, by isolating themselves, repressed their own capacity for evil and projected it outward onto the creatures (their own psychological creation of sorts). Ultimately, one of their own became the monster in their midst (their psychological chicken coming home to roost, so to speak). That this was the mentally challenged character strikes me as being because he, being ""simple"", did not possess the intellectual (or in symbolic terms, spiritual) deviousness to wear society's mask and embrace the group hyposcrisy - thus becoming the perfect scapegoat to bear his society's collective projection. If the leaders were to have acknowledged their complicity in his crime, admitted their ruse to the residents - and led them out of the woods at the end of the movie it would have made for a great Jungian metaphor (Repress stuff onto shadow, finally acknowledge and integrate shadow, move toward psychological wholeness, etc.). But strangely, at the end of the movie it appears that they are simply going to move forward, propping up their delusion and keeping the people in darkness. I'd like to know why M. Night chose this way to end the movie.Overall, an interesting message about how fear is used to control people, the nature of evil, and how we humans will go to great extremes to not see the propensity for evil within ourselves and our own complicity in society's problems.",4,"Good as a psychological period-drama, but not a thriller.",1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,3248,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'scary', 'monster', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', 'blood', 'ai', ""n't"", '90', '%', 'period-piece', 'drama', '10', '%', 'monster', 'movie', 'sense', 'was', 'mis-marketed.Nevertheless', 'liked', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'period-piece', 'drama', 'symbolic', 'message', 'sorts.The', 'story', '19th', 'century', 'puritan-style', 'community', 'living', 'isolated', 'village', 'live', 'low-level', 'constant', 'fear', 'creatures', 'who', 'live', 'surrounding', 'woods.The', 'DVD', 'hours', 'worth', 'extra', 'features', '4', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'explaining', 'making', 'movie', 'interviews', 'actors', 'etc', 'wish', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'segment', 'M.', 'Night', 'S.', 'discussed', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'tale', 'alas', 'such', 'discussion', 'given', '**', 'Attention', 'Spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'plot', 'twist', 'ending', '**What', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'how', 'power', 'use', 'fear', 'control', 'masses', 'story', 'out', 'leaders', 'village', 'simply', 'made', 'up', 'monsters', 'hoax', 'keep', 'people', 'daring', 'go', 'woods', 'so', 'outside', 'world', 'would', ""n't"", 'taint', 'idyllic', 'lifestyle', 'leaders', 'began', 'good', 'intentions', 'ultimately', 'entire', 'life', 'town', 'was', 'built', 'lie', 'end', 'one', 'own', 'residents', 'evil', 'show', 'evil', 'not', 'something', 'rather', 'capacity', 'evil', 'go.The', 'parallel', 'society', 'course', 'how', 'political', 'religious', 'leaders', 'similarly', 'use', 'fear', 'terrorists', 'hell', 'etc', 'keep', 'line', 'usually', 'good', 'intentions', 'own', 'good', 'often', 'based', 'lies', 'Iraq', 'WMDs', 'Iraq', 'tied', '9/11', 'etc', '.If', 'one', 'were', 'look', 'movie', 'psychological', 'standpoint', 'could', 'say', 'town', 'isolating', 'repressed', 'own', 'capacity', 'evil', 'projected', 'outward', 'creatures', 'own', 'psychological', 'creation', 'sorts', 'Ultimately', 'one', 'own', 'became', 'monster', 'midst', 'psychological', 'chicken', 'coming', 'home', 'roost', 'so', 'speak', 'was', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'character', 'strikes', 'being', 'being', 'simple', 'did', 'not', 'possess', 'intellectual', 'symbolic', 'terms', 'spiritual', 'deviousness', 'wear', 'society', 'mask', 'embrace', 'group', 'hyposcrisy', 'thus', 'becoming', 'perfect', 'scapegoat', 'bear', 'society', 'collective', 'projection', 'leaders', 'were', 'have', 'acknowledged', 'complicity', 'crime', 'admitted', 'ruse', 'residents', 'led', 'woods', 'end', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'Jungian', 'metaphor', 'Repress', 'stuff', 'shadow', 'finally', 'acknowledge', 'integrate', 'shadow', 'move', 'psychological', 'wholeness', 'etc.', 'strangely', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'simply', 'going', 'move', 'forward', 'propping', 'up', 'delusion', 'keeping', 'people', 'darkness', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'why', 'M.', 'Night', 'chose', 'way', 'end', 'movie.Overall', 'interesting', 'message', 'how', 'fear', 'used', 'control', 'people', 'nature', 'evil', 'how', 'humans', 'will', 'go', 'great', 'extremes', 'not', 'see', 'propensity', 'evil', 'ourselves', 'own', 'complicity', 'society', 'problems']",N/A
860189,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00064LJVE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 9]","The Village (M. Night Shyamalan, 2004)The first thing that needs to be said about The Village is that it's miles better than Signs. Which wouldn't, actually, have been all that hard. But you know how these things go. It's not Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense, but it'll do for the moment.The best thing about this movie is the casting. Shyamalan has pulled some of the best of the A-list (Shyamalan regular Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody), a former A-lister working his way back up (William Hurt), and a number of underrated who should be on the A-list (Brendan Gleeson, Michael Pitt, Celia Weston, etc.), and topped them all off with Bryce Dallas Howard in her first leading role. Kind of like taking a cast featuring a bunch of veteran actors and then putting Mark Hammill in the lead role.It's not an invalid comparison. Shyamalan often seems to emulate his elders; his Hitchcockian penchant for putting himself in every film has been commented on many thousands of times (here, it's particularly egregiously Hitchcockian), for example. Moreso, however, because Shyamalan, like George Lucas before him, pulls it off. Howard may edge a bit into melodrama a time or two, but for the most part she very much holds her own against the giants around her.None of those are more giant than Brendan Gleeson in the movie's opening scene. One of the best openers in movies in recent years, in fact. Gleeson's performance is so perfect, so understated, that what follows is either the best movie ever or an anticlimax.The Village, unfortunately, is the latter. The story centers around (duh) a village who, according to the schoolteacher (Hurt), have a truce with a race of things that live in the surrounding woods. (No one knows what these things are, but they're large and ugly.) They don't come into the village, and the villagers don't go into the woods. Except that one of the townsmen, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix), has discovered that his mentally challenged friend Noah (Brody) has wandered into the woods without the creatures getting mad, and he thinks he, too, might be able to go through to bring back some of the benefits of late nineteenth century civilization, like new medicines. The creatures, however, are not happy with Lucius' idea...it's a good idea for a story, and the Twilight Zone comparisons are accurate (The Village, like every episode of the original Twilight Zone, deals with the causes and effects of human isolation). Shyamalan also knows when to twist things, and twist them he does; this is just as good a twist as The Sixth Sense had.

Night Shyamalan's got a knack for strange circumstances, haunting filming, and twist of plot and in The Village he uses these teqniques to rescue a relatively simple story from mediocrity.  The village, hidden from the world in the middle of a forest, could be many things at first glance, a religious commune or new settlement but of course all isnt as it seems.  The Village is a very fun movie to watch and the twists of plot, though given away early and pretty easy to figure out make the movie interesting throughout.  Yes the move is not scary, it is not supposed to be Shyamalan understands how to set up a film that seems to lead an audience one way as it really directs them in another way. If you watch this move looking for a scare... well Shyamalan's tricked you.While this movie is a great watch it would have been better if the characters were built up a little more.  The whole aim of the first 20 minutes of the film are devoted to setting up the larger premise (good color bad color etc) and should have used that time better to develop the characters.  Possibly this was intentional in order to build suspense but I doubt it after seeing the directors other work.  Anonther detriment to the characterisation was the 19th grammar and language used in the script.  While it is understandable from watching the film why its overuse might seem phony, this false hood does something to seperate the viewers sympathy from the characters.If you like M. Night Shyamalan you will like this movie and if you are a fan of suspense this movie will certainly please.  For the rest of us this movie does provide entertainment value and is shot beautifully.  Shyamalan has a great knack for giving his films a feel and he does this well... the feeling is unease.  Each scene has some element of unease in it.  I recommend this movie highly as one of the better thriller films of 2004 and the DVD version offers a few good extras including a ""making of"" that is worth watching.-- Ted Murena",4,Great Suspense.

860193,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B00064LJVE,Robert Graves,"[2, 4]","After seeing The Village, I began wondering exactly how much money M. Night Whatever made off The Sixth Sense. It's more than you think. Because revenue-wise, most of Unbreakable, half of Signs, and virtually all of The Village is the remnant of it. What exactly am I saying? I'm saying that had it not been for The Sixth Sense and the hope of genius that it brings with it, not only would I have not paid money for any of these latest three, they probably would have never even been made. Shyamalan has steadily grown more and more mediocre since his brilliant debut.I've wondered why this is from time to time, and a quick glance at the film credits yields the answer - Shyamalan has been given more control, and when one person has as much control as he has on a film, it's a dangerous thing. The fact is that although he wrote and directed all four of these films, he did *not* produce The Sixth Sense; he *did* produce the other three. That means the following - any of the poor plot/direction/writing choices that Shyamalan made on The Sixth Sense were caught and regulated by someone else - on the latest three? Nope. He had the control and could do whatever his little heart desired. Combine this with the fact that The Sixth Sense was just a brilliant idea and the others were somewhat lamer and less dramatic, and you have your answer to the question of how the mind that gave us The Sixth Sense also gave us ""Swing away!""So that brings us to The Village. If The Truman Show and The Big Chill had an ugly baby, it would be M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. Once again, after an impressive ad campaign based mostly on the belying ""from the writer/director of the 6th Sense!"" tag, Shyamalan delivers a complete and utter dud.It has an interesting enough premise. There is an 18th century village that is bordered by thick woods, populated by mystical and deadly creatures. The village supposedly has a peace treaty with the creatures, but then strange things begin happening - animals turn up dead, marks are painted on the doors, noises are heard at night. Meanwhile a bizarre love story is developing between Lucius (Jaoquin Pheonix) and the blind quasi-female-lead Ivy (Bryce Howard). Circumstances then dictate that someone needs to go to the ""towns"" to get medicine, something that is strictly forbidden within the village.I don't want to give away the ""surprise"" so I can't say much more. Suffice it to say that there is one, at least in Shyamalan's mind. And here we come to the problem with every one of his last three disasters. He seems to think that he found a formula with The Sixth Sense - build up suspense then unleash a massive twist - and he keeps trying to plug in various plots and characters to the same equation. I think the problems with this are numerous. First of all, we all know it's coming. With The Sixth Sense, we didn't know what to expect at all. Would there be a twist? Who knew? Furthermore the ""build-up"" to this twist was effortless and almost unnoticeable in The Sixth Sense but in the subsequent films it's relentlessly hammered into the viewer from the opening credits - even from the previews. So we all know there's a twist coming and there's all this shameless build-up, so much so that *nothing* could possibly live up to it. So when Shyamalan unveils his little surprise at the end? It will inevitably be a limp let-down.Couple that with the fact that The Village doesn't have that grand of a premise anyway. If you are actually able to untangle Shyamalan's ""moral"" at the end of this mess, it's truly pointless. Essentially the village head goes against his own rules and in the process disproves his own point, but doesn't even seem to realize it with a bunch of meaningless rhetoric about ""hope."" Ultimately his whole experiment is a failure, much like this movie.A final word - Shyamalan's dialogue is the worst I've ever heard in a major motion picture. I felt this to be true in Signs and it's even truer in The Village. I was literally covering my face in embarrassment a few times, most noticeably during the ""Let's shout it from the rooftops!"" monologue on love, and after Lucius' ""...and yes...I will dance with you,"" trembling declaration. Again - this is the result of one person having too much creative control. Nobody is able to step in (as they presumably were in The Sixth Sense) and say ""No, this needs to change."" Shyamalan seems completely oblivious to this. I expect that he'll continue putting out these self-made movies for many more years, always trying to get back to what he achieved with The Sixth Sense and always falling short.I don't think he'll get many more chances from me.",2,Another M.

860199,A2E1QZ5YSHVQXL,B00064LJVE,Rocky,"[7, 14]","When the commericals showed for this movie, I naturally assumed this film was about true creatures in the forest- but in all bluntness that was a load of lies. This movie is not a thriller, it was hardly a suspense film. Once again I'm fooled into believing that a film is a good film because of a few fast scenes they show on commericals. The Village I thought would be eeriee, at least exciting somewhat. But it is none of that. It's just a boring small town with small town problems, mainly the first hour is about boring relationships that I could have cared less about. The actors are dull and so is the entire plot when you finally get the jist of what is going on. There's a twist at the ending that is truly the only scene that made me open my eyes a bit, but then I sunk back into depression after a minute as the tale once more grew dull. This movie in my opinion is lousy. If you enjoy watching films though about ordinary people living ordinary lives (which I don't) you'll think it's all right. But for people who assumed this was going to be a fast- paced thriller about the supernatural in any way, forget it, there's nothing of the kind in this movie so don't even bother renting it out like I did.Mainly, if you're still interested in watching this, it's about a small town surrounded by a forest and the tale the parents tell the kids is that there are unknown creatures in the forest lurking around. As long as the kids stay out of the forest, the creatures will not cross their borders and terrorize them. Yeah, it sounds interesting. But like I said, when you catch the truth of this plot, you'll realize it does not catch at all the excitement that the commericals made it seem like.

860200,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00064LJVE,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","***1/2Though it's sure not to be everyone's cup of tea, M Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" plays like a good old-fashioned ""Twilight Zone"" episode all done up in period costume and expanded out to feature film length.Set in the late 1800's, the story - which plays like a cross between ""The Crucible"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" - takes place in a small village that has been cut off from the outside world by strange and potentially deadly creatures who inhabit the woods nearby.  These mysterious figures - referred to by the townsfolk as Those We Don't Speak Of - have made some sort of pact with the humans to the effect that they will leave the people alone if the people leave them alone.  However, one individual in the town - a young man named Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) - has an aching desire to leave the village and explore the world beyond the parameters of the woods.  It is that unprecedented willingness to cross the barrier and violate the pact that sets the story in motion.""The Village"" is obviously intended to be an allegory about how humans use fear of the unknown to keep themselves from venturing out to worlds beyond their own, and, concomitantly, to justify hiding from the ugliness of life.  The film has the stripped-down look and feel of a morality play performed on a stage whose sets are simple and stark and whose characters and dialogue are weighted down with heavy symbolic value.  ""The Village"" requires patience from the audience and an acceptance going into the film that this will not be a horror movie in the traditional sense - i.e. one filled with gore and grue or high-octane chills and thrills - but rather a subdued exercise in portentousness and understated suggestion.  In this respect, the movie works quite well.Heavily reliant as it is on imagery and mood to achieve its effects, this is less an actor's film that it is a director's, but Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody as the literal village idiot, deliver reasonably compelling performances.  But it is Bryce Dallas Howard, as a young blind woman sent into the forest on a danger-filled mission to bring help back from town, who shines in the film.Shyamalan has made quite a lucrative career out of movies that use indirection rather than explicitness to generate their suspense.  That ""The Village"" is the weakest of those films thus far (""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" are more fully realized works), doesn't diminish the fact that those willing to give it a chance may find it to be a rewarding experience.",3,better than advertised,1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,2532,"['sure', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Village', 'plays', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'done', 'up', 'period', 'costume', 'expanded', 'out', 'feature', 'film', 'length.Set', 'late', '1800', 'story', 'cross', 'Crucible', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'place', 'small', 'village', 'been', 'cut', 'off', 'outside', 'world', 'strange', 'potentially', 'deadly', 'creatures', 'who', 'inhabit', 'woods', 'nearby', 'mysterious', 'figures', 'referred', 'townsfolk', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Speak', 'have', 'made', 'sort', 'pact', 'humans', 'effect', 'will', 'leave', 'people', 'alone', 'people', 'leave', 'alone', 'However', 'one', 'individual', 'town', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Lucius', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'aching', 'desire', 'leave', 'village', 'explore', 'world', 'parameters', 'woods', 'unprecedented', 'willingness', 'cross', 'barrier', 'violate', 'pact', 'story', 'motion', 'Village', 'obviously', 'intended', 'be', 'allegory', 'how', 'humans', 'use', 'fear', 'unknown', 'keep', 'venturing', 'out', 'worlds', 'own', 'concomitantly', 'justify', 'hiding', 'ugliness', 'life', 'film', 'stripped-down', 'look', 'feel', 'morality', 'play', 'performed', 'stage', 'sets', 'are', 'simple', 'stark', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'are', 'weighted', 'down', 'heavy', 'symbolic', 'value', 'Village', 'patience', 'audience', 'acceptance', 'going', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'traditional', 'sense', 'i.e', 'one', 'filled', 'gore', 'grue', 'high-octane', 'chills', 'thrills', 'rather', 'subdued', 'exercise', 'portentousness', 'understated', 'suggestion', 'respect', 'movie', 'quite', 'well.Heavily', 'reliant', 'imagery', 'mood', 'achieve', 'effects', 'less', 'actor', 'film', 'director', 'Phoenix', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'literal', 'village', 'idiot', 'deliver', 'reasonably', 'compelling', 'performances', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'young', 'blind', 'woman', 'sent', 'forest', 'danger-filled', 'mission', 'bring', 'help', 'back', 'town', 'who', 'film.Shyamalan', 'made', 'quite', 'lucrative', 'career', 'movies', 'use', 'indirection', 'rather', 'explicitness', 'generate', 'suspense', 'Village', 'weakest', 'films', 'thus', 'far', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs', 'are', 'more', 'fully', 'realized', 'works', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'fact', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'may', 'find', 'be', 'rewarding', 'experience']",N/A

860203,AL5BWQ7N6MLQK,B00064LJVE,"Ronin Dave ""Far be it for Logic to Stand in t...","[6, 9]","This review that I had written years ago for an online newspaper is based on the film not the DVD and its features:To start off with, I don't think the premise in ""The Village"" is bad one. The idea is quite interesting, but it's the way the story is presented that bothers me. I can't say much on that at this point of the review without giving a way the ending. Critics have been savaging this movie for cheating audiences with a gimmicky twist. While I do feel cheated in some ways, I feel that if the movie had explored other angles, it could have been a much better movie.The movie begins in a quaint, isolated village of the late 1800s. The people live quiet, simple lives free from the evils of the outside world, which they refer to only as the ""Towns."" They are not free, however, from fear. For outside their lovely, peaceful village lurk horrible creatures that live in the woods and do not suffer trespassers.The villagers refer to these creatures as ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" though they seem to speak an awful lot about them throughout movie so the name seems a bit inappropriate. Perhaps the villagers should have called them ""Those We Sometimes Speak Of"" or ""Those We Actually Speak of Quite Regularly"".Apparently ""Those [They] Don't Speak Of"" have some kind of pact with the villagers though it's never explained how it came about. It's not like you could have a sit-down meeting and negotiate an agreement with creatures you don't speak of. Perhaps these creatures can be spoken ""to"" just so long as they are not spoken ""about.""The pact, anyway, is simple and straightforward: villagers don't go into the woods and the creatures don't go into the village. Oh, and the creatures are attracted to the color red, which the villagers call by ominous name: ""the bad color"". The villagers make sure there is nothing red anywhere in the village. For some reason, yellow is fine by them so the villagers wear yellow when they go walking near the forest or when they go on guard duty.For creatures that aren't spoken about, the villagers worry about them a good deal. The villagers burn torches at night on their perimeter and they keep a guard on duty in a tower. They also paint yellow streaks on the torch stakes that supposedly is to ward off the creatures. The expense of keeping these torches lit should be reason enough one would think to attempt a pre-emptive strike against these creatures before they run out of wood and yellow paint. In addition for defensive purposes, one would think a wall would be far more effective than a few torches and a bucket of yellow paint.One of the villagers named Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) thinks it's possible to go into the woods and even to the ""Towns"" if a person is brave and has an honest purpose such as procuring medicine for the village. The Elders, a group of the original settlers that administer the town, dismiss this notion. The Elders are the only ones who have seen the ""Towns"" where each of them lost family members due to violence. They are reluctant to have any contact with the outside world again. Plus there are those creatures that might rip them all up if they go into the woods [insert a slight snicker here].Eventually someone gets injured and medicine from the ""Towns"" is desperately needed. A party is organized to go into the forbidden woods and to the world beyond. Edward Walker (William Hurt), the de-facto leader of the Elders, plans to go himself but another Elder reminds him of the oath he once swore that he would never go back to the ""Towns."" So instead he sends his blind daughter Ivy, played by Bryce Dallas Howard.This makes perfect sense: send someone who can't see through a forest full of unspeakably horrible unspoken-about creatures and hope they will take pity on her. Then if she makes it through the forest, she will have to deal with the ""Towns"" where she has never been to before nor has any experience with. She's liable to wind up like many country bumpkins do when they go to a big city for the first time: get swindled or outright robbed.Director M. Night Shyamalan's signature twist to the ""The Village"" is ultimately what kills the film. Too much of the film is wrapped up in delivering the twist and keeping the audience clueless until the end; by the time we get there we feel cheated out of a movie. The twist here is too much of a gimmick and doesn't work the way it did with ""Sixth Sense"" (1999) and to some degree ""Unbreakable"" (2000).Shyamalan is effective, though, in creating an atmosphere of suspense and fear at the beginning of the movie. It's just unfortunate that the twist sabotages this promising beginning and creates more than a few plot holes that threaten to swallow the film whole. It's a twist that likely to bring more groans than gasps.=========SPOILER ALERT==========If you haven't seen the film read no further!!!============================There are no monsters. There never have been. There never will be unless you want to count the Elders as monsters for having lied to their children and grandchildren for over 20 years.The monsters are a fabrication created to keep the younger generations from wandering into the woods and finding out that they have been living in a National Park all this time.Apparently the Elders did not abandon the modern society of the 1870s but rather the 1970s. Fleeing violence, disco and polyester leisure suits, the Elders decided to create a Utopian society for themselves away from the world and shag carpeting. Hurt's character it turns out used to be a Professor of American History and Folklore. He came up with the idea of an Utopian Village set in the past and the ""Those [They] Won't Speak Of"" to protect the illusion.This is why the twist ruins a good story. It would have been far more interesting to dwell on the Elders' decision to keep the village's future generations in the dark about the outside world. The village is a sham supported and protected by another sham. Sooner or later someone is likely to stumble across them or simply fly over in a Cessna. The preserve that the villagers live on is surrounded by a wall and guarded by Forest Rangers but that isn't enough to stop potential curious trespassers.And how would the younger generations feel towards the Elders if they found out they had been living in abject fear all their lives for nothing? What would happen if they found out their parents had been lying to them for all these years just to maintain an illusion built for their comfort and solace? Not too mention that their parents are responsible for their neurotic life-long aversion to the color red?There are many different angles this story could have been approached by that might have made for a more interesting film.For one thing, I wanted monsters. I know whole point is that there weren't any monsters but I think a better storyline in this regard could have been either:1) The monsters did exist and were either brought into existence by the power of belief of the villagers -- much to the shock of the Elders -- or the creatures had always existed and were somehow awoken by the villagers;or2) One of the Elders who had either left the village a long time ago or everyone thought dead has gone insane and is living in the woods believing himself to be one of the creatures, thus obeying the rules the Elders made; or it's one of the Elders in the village that has gone schizo and on some nights attacks villagers and livestock.Either way, it would have been better than having the village idiot, played by Adrien Brody, bumbling around in one of the costumes -- which he just happens to find a little too conveniently. He looked like he could barely get his clothes on by himself much less one of those costumes.The monsters being real would have made for a more ironic twist on the Elders who in creating a legend to keep people from going into the woods now actually have something in the woods to be afraid of. The story could have been that the creatures have become so dangerous that the village's only hope is either to escape or bring in help from the outside.I think that could have made for a poignant point: that the very thing the Elders fabricated to keep the village together becomes the very thing that threatens to destroy it because the village is a lie supported by another lie. In the end, the illusion of the village can't last and the lie threatens to destroy them all.Since there are no creatures, however, the rituals for dealing with them come off as far too elaborate (not to mention ridiculous). The Elders must have sat up late many nights coming up with all these rules while they were also trying to figure out how to farm, sew, slaughter livestock and bribe major airlines from flying over.It also becomes staggeringly apparent that it would have been a heck of a lot easier for Hurt or one of the other Elders to have gone to the ""Towns"" and got the medicine. They would have been more familiar with the outside world as opposed to their century-handicapped children. The bit about the oath mentioned above just doesn't seem like a strong or convincing enough reason for Hurt not to go. The oath seems more like a deliberate tool used by the writer/director to send the blind girl in order to heighten the suspense.Hurt does reveal to his daughter out of fatherly love that the creatures don't exist but he says, almost reassuringly to the audience that wants monsters, that there are legends that say these creatures once existed. Hurt reveals to her a costume of the creatures hanging in a shed that the daughter calls, with dread in her voice, the ""Shed We Don't Use.""At this point I realized ""The Village"" suffered from a lack of imagination when it comes to naming things. With names like ""Those We don't Speak of,"" the ""Towns,"" and the ""bad color,"" it makes me wonder what other corny ominous-sounding names they have for things in the village. ""This is the 'Fork We Do Not Use For Salad'"" ""That is the 'Shirt We Do Not Wear At Grandmother's.'""Hurt's revelation is the worst part of the film. Finding out that it's really modern time wasn't as crushing a blow to me as finding out the creatures were fake. The explanation he gives really doesn't wash and it feels as though all the noises and brooding atmosphere of rituals and ""bad colors"" are there just to keep the audience in the dark so as to surprise and shock them later.==========================================Overall, I give ""The Village"" 3 out of 5 stars. The acting is believable though a bit wooden. The atmosphere is creepy and brooding. It's the twist and the missed opportunities that film could have taken that bring what could have been a more interesting film to a disappointing climax.",3,The Village Gets More Groans Than

However, people have come to expect bizarre and unusual surprise plot twists and/or revelations at the end of the film and if someone is not truly taken aback or shocked at the ending of the film I think that results in a lukewarm review. Truth be told &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was the only mainstream film he has done which had a big shocker/revelation at the end of the film. &quot;Signs&quot; seemed to me to deal more with the idea of lost faith and how fate, (providence or God), causes things to happen for a reason and makes people be where they are for a reason, (remember Gibson's brother who washed out of professional baseball and the son with asthma and how both of those conditions were in the end for the benefit of the characters). &quot;Unbreakable&quot; I found simply to be a fun movie exploring in a very real everyday way how a grown family man comes to the realization and terms with the fact that he is a superhero. &quot;The Village&quot; certainly has a twist at the ending, however, it was one that I suspected about 25 minutes into the film. This does not detract from the overall story and the quality of the film. The movie has great performances from some great performers and manages to provide a few chills, (without the necessity of the blood and gore that makes it into far too many of our films). Shyamalan may becoming a victim of his own success; the fact that a few films of his have had &quot;revelations&quot; or &quot;twists&quot; I think has encouraged viewers to expect them and anticipate them. Moreover, if the &quot;revelation&quot; or &quot;twist&quot; doesn't measure up somehow than the armchair critics bash the film.

860217,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B00064LJVE,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[6, 7]","Whenever I went shopping at a local natural foods coop, a male employee would tell me that I look just like Bryce Dallas Howard.  I had no idea who she was until he commented that she is Ron Howard's daughter.  He then recommended that I watch ""The Village"" (assuring me that it really wasn't scary) or ""The Lady in the Water.""  I put that on my never-ending to-do-list and thought that I'd eventually get around to renting those movies. Some of my friends mentioned my resemblance to girl in ""The Village"" as well. But when perfect strangers told me they had to do a double take because they actually thought that I was Bryce Dallas Howard (as though she'd have nothing better to do than go shopping at Target or the mall), I re-prioritized my to-do list.I first rented ""The Lady in the Water."" This movie had great moments, and I especially loved the sense of community in the apartment complex and the characterization of Cleveland Heep, who discovers the narf. That actor, Paul Giamatti, was amazing and brought such warmth and sympathy to his character.  Yes, this movie is an easy target for panning, and if it had strengths, it also had weaknesses (including a more than usual suspension of disbelief).Spoilers Warning:But this review is for ""The Village,"" featuring the same writer/director/producer in M. Night Shyamalan and actress Bryce Dallas Howard.  The ensemble cast was top-notch, and everyone did the most with what they were given.  Adrien Brody managed to evoke sympathy for his character, even after Noah attacked Lucius Hunt in a fit of jealousy.  Due to the elder's removal to the village and refusal to go back to ""real world,"" psychotropic medicines weren't available for the mentally ill Noah.  Lucius asked Ivy if her blindness could have been cured if the elders would have allowed outside treatment. Even though Ivy was blind, she could ""see"" Lucius by sensing a color whenever he was near. Ivy refused to tell Lucius what his color was, but I imagine that she saw red, the forbidden color.  Considering that Ivy was a natural redhead, I thought the shunning of this color a little odd (however, many people argue that red hair is really more orange than red in hue).When Ivy bravely ventures outside the village to procure medicines for her wounded fiance, I kept wondering why Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) didn't spearhead this medical intervention.  Going back to a simpler time and place shouldn't involve watching your child needlessly die.  Edward Walker recruited other disillusioned contemporaries, who like himself, had lost close family members to violence. This group started an Amish-like community, a Pennsylvanian settlement whose members made believe that they were still living in the 19th century, an apparently more idyllic time.People respond differently to tragedy, and this group coped by trying to escape further tragedy. They hoped to create a sort of utopia where the evils of the outside world would never reach its city limits.  They believed that by rejecting what seemed to bring out the worst in people (money, media, fast-paced lifestyle, etc.), they could create a community that would thrive because of family values and cooperation.Yet you can't shut tragedy out. Or if you try to evade one tragedy, you may create another.  Noah is such an example. Noah couldn't control himself, and point blank, he needed to be medicated.  Noah may never have watched violent television, experimented with illicit drugs, been part of a street gang, etc., but the sort of protection The Village offered proved ineffectual in protecting him and other villagers from violence.You do get a sense of family and community within The Village, so this experiment of Dr. Walker isn't an entire fiasco, and they still want to continue living this way, even when Ivy becomes aware of a greater outside world. But I think M. Night Shyamalan's themes about the unavoidability of suffering and the futility of trying to escape it are brilliantly rendered in this movie. Also, you can see the origin of myths and legends at work when the elders started the ""farce"" of the Wood Creatures who would attack the villagers or how the color red was irrationally deemed ""the bad color.""  The young people really bought into this legend, and thus they are controlled in part based on fear (for they are afraid to venture beyond the well-established borders of the Village).  It's ironic that fear and duplicity are utilized to attempt a utopia.  This movie is definitely food for thought in terms of social commentary.I enjoyed the extra features, including Bryce's diary.  I first thought, why is she writing is such an old-fashioned style, then I realized that she was trying to emulate the vocabulary and sentence structure of the 19th century to get into her character.  Bryce gave her all to this role.

860221,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B00064LJVE,Scott Kolecki,"[2, 3]","The Village is the fourth film by M. Night Shayamalan, and as with his earlier films, Night has created a film that will leave audiences guessing throughout the story.Set in the heart of a small village at the turn of the late 18th/early 19th century, ""The Village"" is the story about a small community who live in harmony with ""those that we will not speak of"", a clan of ""creatures"" that live in the forest that surround the village itself.  Living in submission to these ""creatures"", there are those in the town who would risk everything, even death, to venture into the woods beyond to bring better medicines to the village.Joaquin Phoenix (previously seen in ""Signs"") plays Lucius Hunt, the son of one of the town's elders.  A solitary, quiet but caring man, Lucius believes that the ailments of the town can only be solved by going beyond their borders and seeking out the aid of the people that live beyond the woods.  Ivy Walker, (skillfully played by Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind woman has fallen in love with Lucius, and their romance, in only it's infant stages, is cut short when Lucius is mortally wounded by a would-be competitive suitor, a mentally challenged man named Noah Percy.Lucius, who is dieing, can only be helped by the aid of medicine's not available in the village.  Desperate to save her beloved, Ivy decides that she will risk the wrath of the creatures, who have previously manifested themselves whenever the members of the town have so much as taken a single step into their woods, leaving slaugtered livestock in their wake.  Without the aid of anyone or anything, she ventures forth into the woods, seeking the help of whomever-or whatever-lies beyond the woods.Shayamalan, who takes credit for writing, producing and directing this film, weaves a story that is one part love story, one part societal drama, and one part ghost story, blending story and suspense in a way that will leave audiences clinging to the edge of their seats.  Night's characters are believable, and, as with his earlier films, drive the story and make the scary moments all the more intense, the moments of romance that much more tender, and the drama that much more believable.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a story with enough twists to keep even veteran fans of M. Night Shayamalan guessing to the very end.

860222,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B00064LJVE,Scrimshaw,"[2, 2]","The Village is the sixth film written and directed by the now infamous M. Night Shyamalan. It was released in 2004 during his warm period, when he was still reeling from his successes with The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs and may have gotten a bit too cocky when making The Village, which is why it received mixed reviews from critics. Personally, I feel that The Village was a good film, it had likeable characters, it's wasn't boring, and it was at times dramatic and frightening, but I felt it would have been better if it had been handled a little differently. Considering that the Village is supposed to be a pastoral utopian community cut off from the negativity of the outside world, I feel that the film would have been more effective if the Village had been portrayed as a more beautiful, inviting place, and the protagonists and villagers themselves as happier, more content people. Instead the Village looks rather puritan, austere, dull and almost bleak, and the people tend to be more serious and reserved than they should be. The main characters, Ivy, Lucius, and Noah, portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrien Brody respectively, all play their roles well, and I understand that Ivy needed to be blind and Noah mentally retarded for a reason, but I still feel the film should have been done differently to make it's message more effective. The characters all speak old fashioned, but there doesn't seem to be any real reason for this except to keep the twist ending from being revealed too soon. If this village existed in real life, the characters would all speak like modern people, because the descendants of the village elders would have no idea how people spoke in olden times and their parents wouldn't need to fool them into thinking they were really living in an earlier era. I feel that M. Night Shyamalan felt he needed to provide a twist ending so he made the film progress the way it did. I understand why the trailers advertised the film the way they did, because if you really think about it, they couldn't do it any other way without giving away the twist, and this is one of the reasons why I feel that Shyamalan made this film less than what it could have been by feeling the need to add the twist ending.

860223,AONNVIQXNOUGG,B00064LJVE,Sean Devlin,"[1, 2]","Cast your mind back to 1999. Thinking about ""the Matrix""? or ""Star Wars: Ep. 1: The Phantom Menace"". What about ""the Sixth Sense"". the cinematic introduction of M. Night Shyalaman (not counting ""Praying with Anger"" or ""Wide Awake""). The thriller of the year, it woahed critics and movie goers alike.""Unbreakable"" followed, and cut the Shyalaman fanbase in half, as did ""Signs"" in 2002, but it was this reviewers favourite Night movie.He's back, with a darkly gothic thriller set in a small Pensylvanian village in the late 1800s. The villagers are cut off from the outside world due to a large wood that surrounds the village. According to the Village elders, a mythtical race of creatures inhabits the woods and they live in peace with a truce: The villlgefolk stay out of the woods, and the creatures stay out of the village.Under the guidence of Edward Walker (William Hurt), the village childeren are educated and there is no need for intervention from the Outside world. Until Lucious Hunt (Jaquin Pheonix, brilliant as ever) ventures into the wood, and the truce ids broken.Sounds thrilling doesnt it? Well sadly, ""The Village"" never really gets off the ground. The picturesque surroundings are the most exciting thing in the very slow build up, which is only watchable due to Pheonix and Ron Howards daughter Bryce Dallas, who plays William Hurt's daughter Ivy, who is blind. Their performances are excellent, so natural and truly wasted in a bizarrly poor Shyalaman screenplay (nothing like the excellently black comedy edge to ""Signs"" that just teetered above satire).The first half is lit up by one set piece, the creatures coming into the village to warn us the truce has ended, and that is very well done, Shyalaman showing shades of genuis behind the flaws.The second half concerns Pheonix being stabbed and Ivy having to cross the woods to seek medical help for her true love. Sadly, 90% of the second act is dishwasher dull and contains twists that most people will see coming. (No Keyzer Soze, then!).The performances vary, beyond the excellence of the leads, William Hurt shines, but talent is wasted on the supporting characters. Adrian Brody plays a mentally challanged villager, but there is no depth role for him to delve into.This also goes for Sigourney Waever and Brenden Gleeson.The most frustrating thing about ""The Village"" is that its not awful, if you think about it, it's quite good, but when you think of the high standards Shyalman has set himself, it falls very short.

Shyamalan hasn't lost his eye as a story teller, and to be fair, there are about two moments where music and cinematography blend into a pitch-perfect startling moment.But cheesy dialogue abounds, and an hour into the movie we're still being introduced to characters in the past, none of which really amount to much until the end. It's a lesson in how to take well known stars of the cadre of Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, etc., and give them micro-minor scraps of roles to get by on. Such frittering of talent.As for the theme, the lesser said the better.  While the first half is simply laborious, the second steps up to the plate and defies all imaginable logic.

Night Shyamalan's best work and I wasn't expecting much. I actually thought from the trailers that I had already figured out the whole plot... but I was way off.The film opens to a small grave-side ceremony where a man buries his young son after a lengthy illness. The grave marker gives us the time period - 1897. In this modest village, the townsfolk are friendly and easy going. All are mild-tempered and seem to have strong family bonds. There are chickens and sheep - even the occasional dog, but we never see a train, a wagon or a horse - the only mode of transportation in this town is by foot.We quickly learn that there is something sinister that bonds these townsfolk and it's not just the brevity of life in this era. There are creatures - very large creatures, with hideous claws and a creepy growl that live in the woods surrounding the village. There is a truce among them - no one from the village ventures to the woods and for many years, the creatures have avoided entering the village.Dead animals start appearing - baby sheep and chickens - killed and clawed - all fur removed, but the meat remains - just the animals skinned alive for no apparent reason other than to frighten the villagers.Joaquin Phoenix plays Lucious Hunt, a soft-spoken, thoughtful young man who is the only child of his widowed mother. His mother, played by Sigourney Weaver, is one of the town's elders. Lucious approaches the elders' weekly meeting, asking permission to pass through the woods and go to the towns to retrieve new medicines that could help prevent deaths of more children in the future. The death of the young boy, Daniel, greatly affected Lucious and he fears more dead children more than he fears the creatures.We find that all of the elders once lived in the towns - all of them had beloved family members that were cruelly murdered in the towns by criminals and they find the towns to be wicked, evil places, which is why they call Coventry, their village, their sanctuary from evil.When Lucious tries his theory, that the creatures will sense his good nature and let him pass through the woods, the creatures wreak havoc through the village. They put red marks on all the doors and upset the living quarters in every home. They leave more dead, skinned animals behind as further chilling warnings not to penetrate the woods again. We see one of these creatures and wonder, ""what in the heck are these hideous things?!""We see about as many glimpses of the creature as we saw of the aliens in ""Signs,"" brief and just enough to scare you out of your drawers.Even if you catch on to the plot before the film comes to an end, you will still be entertained. The film is so well shot - every angle and reflection is so well-thought out - it is truly a work of art. As is his custom, Shyamalan gives himself a small cameo role, but unlike his cameo in ""Signs,"" it is so unobtrusive, you may not even notice him or think, ""when will this awkward scene be over?""There is not much more I can tell without spoiling the story - it will keep you guessing until almost the end.

Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen the movie I'll just say his movies (and this movie in particular) need to be seen like a feature length episode of the classic Twilight Zone TV series.  It might not be classified as horror.  It might or might not be sci-fi.  And it might or might not be a work of fantasy.  Like Rod Serling's classic series M. Night Shyamalan's films go beyond easy classification.Perhaps The Village and his other films may or may not compare favorably to Rod Serling's most memorable Twilight Zone episodes but I certainly appreciate the creative effort in bringing this kind of modern ""fairy tales"" for adults.  This movie is about a group people who have chosen to seperate themselves from the corrupting influences of mainstream society.  And the lengths they go through in order to maintain their ""ideal"" society; despite the dangers that exist beyond the woods.  This was the story M.

Night Shyamalan's films for his willingness to press further into the human experience of the strange, both metaphysically and culturally.  To that end, I found ""The Village"" to be more frightening with regard to the underpinnings of society than to any psychological or spiritual terror.  Without giving too much away this film is about a group of people attempting to cope with, deny, and stave off further tragedy.  What was perhaps most significant about this approach is that in approaching grief in this way the group regresses to what would be considered an archaic way of living, rather than transcends grief and moves on.In this closed off society the young, blind Ivy seeks to venture through the wild unknown of the village's surrounding territory in search of medication for the sick among them.  It is quite fitting in this context that the one who is the least tainted, the least obscured by boundaries of society or the way in which she experiences life to be the one who discovers the debilitating limitations society has imposed upon them all.While I did not find ""The Village"" to be Shyamalan's best work, the film was well done.  Suspenseful moments keep it lively while the details of 19th century living were well crafted.  The cast was wonderful, all performances well done.

I found it somewhat boring at times, especially being set back way in time. The plus to this movie is the outstanding performance by Bryce Howard.. Ron Howard's daughter. What a great performance she gave us playing a blind girl. The other plus was Sigourney Weaver being in this film for I am a huge fan of hers. I won't go into the details of the movie because some of the other reviews give you all you need to know. One night, with  nothing else playing on t.v., The Village was playing on one of the movie channels so I decided to watch it a 2nd time. I must say that this is one of those movies that is better the 2nd time you watch it. After watching it the 1st time, I would have given it probably a 1 star but now having seen it 3 times, I now give it 3 stars between the acting, the plot and the ""love story"".

You would think that it is about a small village from the 1800s or something that is being tormented by outside demons or something- monsters would be a better description. From the commercials, you see a red mark painted on peoples' doors. You may think this attracts these creatures, or scares them away. But The Village is actually the last thing you expect......I'm not going to explain the enitre plot, but I'll explain the basic idea: It's about a, well, a village that secretly shuns itself from technology and the outside world. Only a select number of people know this, and they are to keep it secret from the rest of the village. To make sure that no one finds out, if someone crosses the limit of the forest, someone dresses up in the costume of a creature, and chases them off. Then, other people dress up in these costumes and got to the village. They go into the peoples' houses and act like they're going to kill them, but the people hide and the people in the costumes act like they can't see them. This is supposed to warn the people that they are not to go beyond the forest limit.There's a lot more to the plot than that, but I don't want to explain anymore, since everyone else has explained the plot. The 1st time I saw this, I hated it. I was expecting monsters and intense scenes and so on. After my dad explained it to me, I was able to shed some light on The Village and actually enjoy it. It's no The 6th Sense, or even another Signs, but James Atkinson proves that he's a pretty good director, and I think that if you approach this movie with an open mind, you can actually enjoy it.

As this has been a growing source of....'discontent' may be too strong a word, more like 'disagreement'..in the village for some years, it's not having a debilitating effect on the little community.

Of the two major twistpoints, one I'd guessed at, although it unfolded in a manner quite differently than I'd figured it would, and the other caught me 100% offguard.  This is a thoughtful and atmospheric shocker, outstandingly handled in every respect (not least of all the multiple high-caliber performances).  M. Night Shymalan has yet to deliver a bad or even a merely average movie (although a lot of people in the media seem to be holding their breath and hoping he does, for some reason), and ""The Village"", along with ""Unbreakable"", is one of his two best in my opinion.

I went to this film expecting only the signature Shyamalan plot twist. I wasn't disappointed.The acting is superb as is the casting, the lead however, goes to Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker and Phoenix as Lucius Hunt. The script, the music, the cinematography are all excellent. The music especially is memorable for weaving an atmosphere of that gives you images of suspense, terror but it is also beautiful orchestral music. This film is undeserving of the bad reviews from viewers who were too narrow minded to enjoy this film for what it really is: a drama.I see this as Shyamalan's attempt at breaking out of the ""thriller"" genre that the superb ""The Sixth Sense"" has entombed him in. This is his introduction to his other talents at filmmaking. This is not a ""thriller"" or a run-of-the-mill horror film, this is a drama film laced with suspense. It is Shyamalans version of an emotional film with scenes of terror and suspense throughout. ""The Village"" shows us that the terror is not only in the unknown but in the things in our lives that we try to leave behind and also in the feelings that we keep hidden.Above all this film is about the innocence in us, and the means that some people will go to preserve it. If you want a film that makes you think, that will also scare you but one that is also eerie and hauntingly beautiful then you must see this film, it shows a whole new side to M.

By and large Hollywood sells us stars in situations -- see Arnold kill bad guys and get the girl, see Meg Ryan fall in love..again...and again...What sets MNS apart is that he is a moralist first, a storyteller second, and a Hollywood exec third (if at all), and I think it is this distinctive counter-programming that is the secret to his success -- his brand has become synonimous with plot-driven movies engaging fundamental themes.I know everyone will expect the plot twist, and there's enough foreshadowing that it's easier to spot than in some of his previous efforts, but that's not the reason to see this film.The reason you want to see this film is the relationship between Lucius (played in a very restrained, deeply emotional way by Joaquin Phoenix) and Ivy (played brilliantly by Bryce Howard -- she sells you on her blindness and her capability and perspicacity, not an easy combination to pull off from an acting standpoint) -- some of the scenes between them are lyrically lovely, and then you realize after the twist is revealed, how lyrical and meaningful the interactions among the elders, and between the elders and the next generation are.Some movies just dissipate the minute you walk out of the theater.

The sincerity and realness of each of the characters made me feel for them personally.The writing and dialog was beautiful and moving. The simplicity of the characters made the power of their essence all the more profound. The atmosphere and cinematography created the perfect mood in each scene. And the direction was genius. There was never one moment where I was disappointed or felt the director had sold out or given in to a Hollywood device.And this film kept me on the edge of my seat.

860250,A3JW7TT6JF5FJ1,B00064LJVE,"Steve Klemow ""srklemow""","[7, 11]","I read the occasional reverent reviews towards this mess and am just dumbfounded. People--this film is the work of an absolutely rank amateur. One reviewer called it a tale of how fear manipulates, deceives, and tricks us all--he's close, but it's really about how M. Night Shyamalan manipulates, deceives, and tricks us all. Every scare is a complete cheat, and anyone with an ounce of perception will quickly see that several plot elements are introduced out of context (out of NOWHERE!), with no other function except to keep us guessing what the hell is going on. It is one implausible red herring after another, with outrageously illiterate, forced dialogue and not one developed character in the bunch. There are people all over the place in this film, and we couldn't care less about any of them--everytime a character is forced to show some emotion (melodramatically), it's like watching a generic casting audition.Shyamalan has made a career out of the big plot twist, and he's clearly getting desperate for ideas. He lets the cat out of the bag this time with a good half hour left to go, and we are tortured for the remainder of the film watching all the innumerable dolts in the ensemble cast (many of whom are esteemed actors, who seem mortified with embarrassment) go through one expository exercise after another to complete the arc of the plot. Check out Celia Weston burst into hysterical tears when she learns that her son is dead, then promptly shut up and drop out of character while William Hurt delivers another homily out of Swiss Family Robinson.Oh, we also get to watch this ditzy twit run a veritable obstacle course through a brightly lit, densely overgrown forest, revealing herself to be one of the most remarkably dexterous and agile blind people on Earth. She accidentally falls into a ravine, and despite the fact that she is wearing a petticoat, manages to hang on by one arm while throwing her burlap sack and cane to safety. She sprints at one point for several hundred yards, and manages never to trip over all sorts of roots, stones, underbrush, and holes, and never once runs into a tree. Apparently she has a very keen sense of smell or something. And Shyamalan evidently realized that he'd deflated all the tension after revealing the big secret, so he momentarily backtracks for one last scare in the form of a coda so dubious and poorly structured that it must have been tacked onto the shooting script on a yellow sticky.M. Night Shyamalan is shrewd. He knows the formula. He likes to refer to his films as personal visions, as if this narcissistic spoiled brat from an affluent immigrant family had the slightest concept of the experience of all the imperiled down-home working class folk in his pictures. What he knows is how to appeal to the masses, with maudlin morality tales, good ol' Christian family values, and bloodless pseudohorror films that might give Ned Flanders a little jolt, but to the rest of us have absolutely no visceral weight. He's a Pennsylvania native, and is well known to be provincial about it; he's eschewed moving to New York or LA in favor of building a film production company on the Main Line, one of the most white bread locales on the planet. This may explain the banality of his choices. I thought we had established that the Amish were unworthy of dramatic material with ""Witness"". He apparently thought so too, and livened things up a bit with faux wisteria and what appear to be Trapp candles for a wedding scene. Apparently there's a former employee of MJ Designs amongst the elders.I did enjoy the possibly unintentional homage to Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"", in the form of the mysterious creature running around in a red cape. I'm rather pissed that everytime I see that masterpiece in the future I'm going to be reminded of this piece of celluloid dreck, which should be cut up into guitar picks.Watch the extras on the DVD for ""The Sixth Sense"" sometime--there's an excerpt from a Super 8 film that Shyamalan shot when he was 12 or something. His technique and level of sophistication haven't changed--he just has more expensive equipment now. And Roger Deakins on board as DP to make his adolescent ideas look like a Miramax picture. I'm sure he'll continue to make millions--there's the real horror.The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)",2,What are people thinking?,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,4323,"['read', 'occasional', 'reverent', 'towards', 'mess', 'am', 'just', 'dumbfounded', 'People', 'film', 'work', 'absolutely', 'rank', 'amateur', 'One', 'reviewer', 'called', 'tale', 'how', 'fear', 'manipulates', 'deceives', 'tricks', 'close', 'really', 'how', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'deceives', 'tricks', 'Every', 'scare', 'complete', 'cheat', 'anyone', 'ounce', 'perception', 'will', 'quickly', 'see', 'several', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'introduced', 'context', 'NOWHERE', 'other', 'function', 'keep', 'guessing', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'one', 'implausible', 'red', 'herring', 'outrageously', 'illiterate', 'forced', 'dialogue', 'not', 'one', 'developed', 'character', 'bunch', 'are', 'people', 'place', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'everytime', 'character', 'forced', 'show', 'emotion', 'melodramatically', 'watching', 'generic', 'casting', 'audition.Shyamalan', 'made', 'career', 'big', 'plot', 'twist', 'clearly', 'getting', 'desperate', 'ideas', 'cat', 'bag', 'time', 'good', 'half', 'hour', 'left', 'go', 'are', 'tortured', 'remainder', 'film', 'watching', 'innumerable', 'dolts', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'esteemed', 'actors', 'who', 'seem', 'mortified', 'embarrassment', 'go', 'one', 'expository', 'exercise', 'complete', 'arc', 'plot', 'Check', 'out', 'Celia', 'Weston', 'burst', 'hysterical', 'tears', 'when', 'son', 'dead', 'then', 'promptly', 'shut', 'up', 'drop', 'character', 'William', 'Hurt', 'homily', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson.Oh', 'also', 'get', 'watch', 'ditzy', 'twit', 'run', 'veritable', 'obstacle', 'course', 'brightly', 'lit', 'densely', 'overgrown', 'forest', 'revealing', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'remarkably', 'dexterous', 'agile', 'blind', 'people', 'Earth', 'accidentally', 'ravine', 'fact', 'wearing', 'petticoat', 'hang', 'one', 'arm', 'throwing', 'burlap', 'sack', 'cane', 'safety', 'one', 'point', 'several', 'hundred', 'yards', 'never', 'trip', 'sorts', 'roots', 'stones', 'underbrush', 'holes', 'never', 'once', 'tree', 'Apparently', 'very', 'keen', 'sense', 'smell', 'something', 'Shyamalan', 'evidently', 'realized', ""'d"", 'deflated', 'tension', 'revealing', 'big', 'secret', 'momentarily', 'one', 'last', 'scare', 'form', 'coda', 'so', 'dubious', 'poorly', 'structured', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tacked', 'shooting', 'script', 'yellow', 'sticky.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'shrewd', 'formula', 'refer', 'films', 'personal', 'visions', 'narcissistic', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'affluent', 'immigrant', 'family', 'had', 'slightest', 'concept', 'experience', 'imperiled', 'down-home', 'working', 'class', 'folk', 'pictures', 'What', 'how', 'appeal', 'masses', 'maudlin', 'morality', 'tales', 'good', 'ol', 'Christian', 'family', 'values', 'bloodless', 'pseudohorror', 'films', 'might', 'give', 'Ned', 'Flanders', 'little', 'jolt', 'rest', 'have', 'absolutely', 'visceral', 'weight', 'Pennsylvania', 'native', 'well', 'known', 'be', 'provincial', 'eschewed', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'LA', 'favor', 'building', 'film', 'production', 'company', 'Main', 'Line', 'one', 'most', 'white', 'bread', 'locales', 'planet', 'may', 'explain', 'banality', 'choices', 'thought', 'had', 'established', 'Amish', 'were', 'unworthy', 'dramatic', 'material', 'Witness', 'apparently', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'livened', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'faux', 'wisteria', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'Trapp', 'candles', 'wedding', 'scene', 'Apparently', 'former', 'employee', 'MJ', 'Designs', 'elders.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'possibly', 'unintentional', 'homage', 'Roeg', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Now', 'form', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'running', 'around', 'red', 'cape', ""'m"", 'rather', 'pissed', 'everytime', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'future', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'reminded', 'piece', 'celluloid', 'dreck', 'should', 'be', 'cut', 'up', 'guitar', 'picks.Watch', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'sometime', 'excerpt', 'Super', '8', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'shot', 'when', 'was', '12', 'something', 'technique', 'level', 'sophistication', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'just', 'more', 'expensive', 'equipment', 'now', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'board', 'DP', 'make', 'adolescent', 'ideas', 'look', 'Miramax', 'picture', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'make', 'millions', 'real', 'horror.The', 'Village', 'Widescreen', 'Vista', 'Series']",N/A

It was just so darn good that he's going to spend the rest of his career regretting it--because every movie he does will inevitably be compared to it.And I believe that's the main reason the critics have been so hard on ""The Village."" Even though it is a fine movie, better entertainment than 90% of the year's releases, it wasn't as good as ""The Sixth Sense"" so people feel let down.But let's not compare, let's just look at ""The Village."" The cinematography is exceptional, creating a moody, suspenseful tale that doesn't depend on lurid special effects for its impact. The dialogue is a bit stilted, but the acting is solid, (impeccable in the case of Bryce Dallas Howard). Yes, the pacing is a little off and after the second sinkhole scene (I'm being careful to not give out any plot spoilers) we feel a little let down. But this film has a clever, well-executed premise and explores important questions about humanity in an entertaining way: can we escape tragedy? is it even worthwhile to try?Ultimately Shyamalan leads us to discover that we can't run from man's inhumanity to man because wherever we go we take it with us, but the effort is still noble because love and hope make the struggle worthwhile. And that's a lesson you don't learn from having a sixth sense, only from experiencing life with others in the village of life.",4,"solid, entertaining and thought-provoking",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1430,"['unfortunate', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'first', 'major', 'movie', 'was', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'good', 'going', 'spend', 'rest', 'career', 'regretting', 'movie', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'compared', 'it.And', 'believe', 'main', 'reason', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'hard', 'Village', 'Even', 'fine', 'movie', 'better', 'entertainment', '90', '%', 'year', 'releases', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'so', 'people', 'feel', 'let', 'down.But', 'let', 'not', 'compare', 'let', 'just', 'look', 'Village', 'cinematography', 'exceptional', 'creating', 'moody', 'suspenseful', 'tale', ""n't"", 'depend', 'lurid', 'special', 'effects', 'impact', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'stilted', 'acting', 'solid', 'impeccable', 'case', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Yes', 'pacing', 'little', 'off', 'second', 'sinkhole', 'scene', ""'m"", 'being', 'careful', 'not', 'give', 'out', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'feel', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'film', 'clever', 'well-executed', 'premise', 'important', 'questions', 'humanity', 'entertaining', 'way', 'can', 'escape', 'tragedy', 'even', 'worthwhile', 'try', 'Ultimately', 'Shyamalan', 'discover', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'wherever', 'go', 'take', 'effort', 'still', 'noble', 'love', 'hope', 'make', 'struggle', 'worthwhile', 'lesson', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'having', 'sixth', 'sense', 'only', 'experiencing', 'life', 'others', 'village', 'life']",N/A
860255,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00064LJVE,Steven Reynolds,"[5, 6]","That this can be M. Night Shyamalan's least effective film to date, yet still a reasonably good one, says a lot for the young man's talent.  It's superbly shot, cunningly edited, beautifully scored, and has a wonderful cast of established (though oddly stilted) stars and a startlingly good newcomer in Bryce Dallas Howard.  The problem, surprisingly, is the screenplay.  Usually it's the brilliant linchpin of Shyamalan's work, but this one wears its post-9/11-""love conquers all"" subtext just a little too showily on its sleeve, and spends way too much of the first hour setting up a sweet but lugubrious romance when, true to the trailer, it might have been better if it was scaring the pants off us.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with a movie that refuses to pander to audience expectations.  ""Signs"" pulled that trick brilliantly - an ""aliens movie"" that ended up having very little to do with aliens.  The trick to making that one work, however, was that for 90% of the film it WAS actually about aliens - not faith, serendipity and the interconnectedness of all things.  For 90% of ""Signs"" we were terrifyingly entertained.  For a large part of ""The Village"" we're teetering on the edge of boredom.  Perhaps the problem is simply that we're all finally learning how to watch Shyamalan's films: its very difficult to become thoroughly engaged in what happens in the first 80 minutes when you know it's all about to be spectacularly undone with a twist (or two).  This time around, when those moments come, they're handled with all the spine-chilling flair we've come to expect from Shyamalan, and you can't help smiling at how thoroughly you've been duped - yet again! - and the extraordinary imaginative power of the man behind it all.  I'll never get tired of those moments, especially when they're as beautifully realized as they are here - the editing of voice over, music and images is pure magic.  These moments make this kind of story worth telling.  See ""The Village"" by all means, but it's best if you DON'T expect horror and DO approach it with an open mind: kind of apt, I guess, given the hopeful political message Shyamalan's pushing this time around.  Leave your fear at the door.Update, October 3: I've seen this film twice now, and it's far better the second time around - 4 stars.  When you aren't expecting to be frightened, the subtle tone of the first hour is much more readily appreciated, and really chimes with William Hurt's pronouncements on hope and love later in the film.",3,"Post-terrorist allegory will please some, bore others",1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,2509,"['can', 'be', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'least', 'effective', 'film', 'date', 'yet', 'still', 'reasonably', 'good', 'one', 'lot', 'young', 'man', 'talent', 'superbly', 'shot', 'cunningly', 'edited', 'beautifully', 'scored', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'established', 'oddly', 'stilted', 'stars', 'startlingly', 'good', 'newcomer', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'problem', 'surprisingly', 'screenplay', 'brilliant', 'linchpin', 'Shyamalan', 'work', 'one', 'post-9/11-', 'love', 'conquers', 'subtext', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'showily', 'sleeve', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'hour', 'setting', 'up', 'sweet', 'lugubrious', 'romance', 'when', 'true', 'trailer', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'scaring', 'pants', 'course', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'pander', 'audience', 'expectations', 'Signs', 'pulled', 'trick', 'brilliantly', 'aliens', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'aliens', 'trick', 'making', 'one', 'work', 'however', 'was', '90', '%', 'film', 'WAS', 'actually', 'aliens', 'not', 'faith', 'serendipity', 'interconnectedness', 'things', '90', '%', 'Signs', 'were', 'terrifyingly', 'entertained', 'large', 'part', 'Village', ""'re"", 'teetering', 'edge', 'boredom', 'Perhaps', 'problem', 'simply', ""'re"", 'finally', 'learning', 'how', 'watch', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'very', 'difficult', 'become', 'thoroughly', 'engaged', 'what', 'first', '80', 'minutes', 'when', 'know', 'be', 'spectacularly', 'undone', 'twist', 'two', 'time', 'around', 'when', 'moments', 'come', ""'re"", 'handled', 'spine-chilling', 'flair', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Shyamalan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smiling', 'how', 'thoroughly', ""'ve"", 'been', 'duped', 'yet', 'again', 'extraordinary', 'imaginative', 'power', 'man', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'moments', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'beautifully', 'realized', 'are', 'here', 'editing', 'voice', 'music', 'images', 'pure', 'magic', 'moments', 'make', 'kind', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'See', 'Village', 'means', 'best', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'expect', 'horror', 'DO', 'approach', 'open', 'mind', 'kind', 'apt', 'guess', 'given', 'hopeful', 'political', 'message', 'Shyamalan', 'pushing', 'time', 'around', 'Leave', 'fear', 'door.Update', 'October', '3', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'now', 'far', 'better', 'second', 'time', '4', 'stars', 'When', 'are', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'be', 'frightened', 'subtle', 'tone', 'first', 'hour', 'much', 'more', 'readily', 'appreciated', 'really', 'chimes', 'William', 'Hurt', 'pronouncements', 'hope', 'love', 'later', 'film']",N/A

But for this one, its a no. My problem is not that the movie is not scary, neither violent. A good movie doesnt need to be scarey to be good. I have problems to see what makes all these elements fits into one movie, I just dun see why is necessary to unfold that the village is actually an isolated area from the modern society and everyone inside are escapers from their normal life for their own reasons. Afterall 80% of story is about base on the perspective of this blinded girl to unfold the story between the village and this unknown monster out there. But at the end it comes in the other truth about the village is everyone who lives there are escapers from normal modern life. My problem is, this part of the truth dun emotionally line up with the main plot. It felt like the reason they must live a life like people from the past is pretty nonsense. Well, of course Shyamalan got his answer on this one, because the town people were all escaping the theri normal life and so then they created this iconic hilious creature to remind everyone about their ugly past, and which accidently created this unfortunate event, besides the monster outside town is symbolizing their fear of the outside world.

Night Shyamalan's crap-fest, &quot;The Village&quot;An abortion of a film, &quot;The Village&quot; is the ripoff movie of 2004 with &quot;Van Helsing&quot; right next to it. These 2 films are playing in every multiplex in hell along with &quot;Signs&quot;, & &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, with a complimentary helping of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; thrown in for good measure (now THAT'S scary!). &quot;The Village&quot; is a scary movie that is made for women (its the type of scary movie that won't induce nightmares. In other words, its NOT scary) & looks like it was filmed on location at the local &quot;Pottery Barn&quot;.&quot;Covington Woods&quot; is home to a small village of peaceful people who have a small problem. They can't leave their village due to &quot;creatures&quot; living in the woods that surround the boundaries beyond the village. When the villagers first settled down into their new home, they made a pact with the &quot;creatures&quot; along the lines of, you leave us alone, we will leave you alone. &quot;The creatures&quot; have other ideas sneaking into the village at night leaving behind dead, mangled, & hairless chihuahuas about the grounds & scaring the villagers witless. When a stabbing occurs, that could prove fatal if not without the proper medication, a young blind girl, who isn't afraid of &quot;the creatures&quot;, is sent to the village across the way to get the proper medication that can heal her future husband.As I watched &quot;The Village&quot;, with roughly 30 other people in the theater, I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The only comedy relief that came throughout the film was when one of my fellow moviegoers promptly stood up during a slow point in the film, declared that this movie, quote - unquote, blows, and then left the theater. What suprised me was that not one of the 29 other people, myself included, didn't disagree with him!The movie is a bit of a bore. I do give credit for some great cinematography but thats it. The cast is lame. Everyone walks thru their roles. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in her role (I was waiting for her to cowboy up, slap her idiot son in the back of the head, and go kill &quot;the creatures&quot; herself). William Hurt reads his lines as if their on cue cards. Joaquin Phoenix looks like he's on some bad valium trip (his character is reminiscent of the Mel Gibson character from &quot;Signs&quot;. Phoenix even looks like a bit like Gibson in some shots).&quot;The creature&quot; is absolutely laughable, being a cross between a pig, & a porcupine with a red riding hood complex (Frank, the bunny from &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, is more scarier, for God's Sake!). I would be more scared if a car full of clowns showed up in the middle of the woods, than this &quot;creature&quot; chasing me.The so called &quot;gotcha&quot; surprise that happens in every one of Shyamalan's films usually suck. This one is no surprise (when the surprise is revealed, I couldn't help but think if these people missed watching the Democratic Convention and hugging a tree everyday. Maybe they still hug trees, but their was no hugging of trees on screen).Shyamalan's main downfall is that he always has the sense & style to create a suspenseful film but when it comes to the payoff, or the moneyshot he can never deliver (&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the golden exception). Also, the main problem with Shyamalan's film is, after the release of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; & with every Shyamalan film there after, audiences know something is going to happen during the final act of the film, so they keep their eyes open for every little detail available thruout the course of the film.&quot;Time&quot; magazine was once quoted as saying that M. Night Shyamalan is the next Steven Spielberg. No way in Hell, buddy. No way.

Hurt) in an extremely slow, halting cadence that becomes tiresome. Their conversation sounds like Amish people speaking under the influence of seconal, and if I lived there, I would spend all my time completing their sentences.Other than the children, there is virtually no joy in the village...largely due, no doubt, to the red-cloaked ""monsters"" that menace the villagers from the woods that surround them. I felt that the monsters and their menace were very well presented. I was totally ""creeped out"" when one of them visited the village late at night and almost got its claws (twigs ?) on the blind girl, Ivy, the ""star"" of the movie, very well played by Ron Howard's daughter.All of this tension and suspense began to unwind (for me), however, when Ivy is sent to ""The Towns"" (apparently external civilization) for medicine for her injured boyfriend. I swear that I recall this plot from an old Twilight Zone about 40 years ago. Perhaps that memory, or just common sense, led me to figure out the ""surprise"" ending well before it happened.The transparancy of this final plot twist is probably the movie's greatest flaw.

860269,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B00064LJVE,"the one and only ""david""","[3, 3]","Like every other film by M. Night Shyamalans films, we are left to figure out the big twist at the very end that will be sure to make our hair stand on end as they did in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs.""However this one twist in the movie tends to be toned down a bit, which is sort of a surprise and kind of a dissapointment, considering Shyamalan has been on a role. Nonetheless this film is still full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing till the end, it did for me.The main plot is that a village of people, that is set sometime in the 1800's, are completely cut off from the world. They live in their small town surrounded by woods where these creatures also live in.At first we do not know much about them except for the fact that they are called, ""Those we do not speak of,"" by the townsfolk, and also the fact that they are attracted to the color red. Whether the color is on clothes, berries, or flowers, the color is called the ""bad color"" and is buried in the ground right away if seen anywhere near the village. The people in the village do not go into the woods, and the creatures in the woods do not go into the village.Joaquin Phoenix plays Lucius, a quiet young man that does not fear the creatures, in fact he does not fear anything at all, except for the saftey of another which I will talk about later.As far as the plot is concerned, Lucius is only in the first half as a man who has to write out what he wants to say in order for him to actually say it.When dead animals start to show up in the village many people are afraid that the creatures are starting to break the truce they have with people. At first they pretend the acts are by coyotes, but when more and more start showing up, the people start to worry even more.Despite the fact that the movie does try to stick to the plotline, several moments were pretty slow, but Shyamalan tries to keep it interesting by showing several moments of suspense that only he can deliver, including a few seconds of us actually seeing the creatures in the light. And believe me, they are nothing what you will expect.Bryce Dallas Howard makes her acting debut I believe in this movie as Ivy, the daughter of the leader of the town who is also blind. But she is a remarkable person who can actually do a lot of what other people cant, and she is great in this movie. She is also the character that Lucius is afraid of for her safety.And to those of you who saw the movie ""The Pianist"" did you actually think you would see Adrian Brody as the character that he is here? Kind of a real shocker if you think about it.As for the scary scenes, they definately deliver, my opinion, and are relatively evened out in the movie, though the first hour rearely has them. The scene in the woods with Ivy I'll admit were suspensful, and it was in daylight too.The ending isn't the greatest, but this definately isn't the worst movie you will see. Sure it isn't on the same level as Shyamalan's others, but everyone has to take a break now and then, right? Anyway this is a great movie to rent, and definately not worth throwing it in the trash.",3,"Not as good as  previous films, but still suspenseful....",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,3105,"['other', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalans', 'films', 'are', 'left', 'figure', 'out', 'big', 'twist', 'very', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'make', 'hair', 'stand', 'end', 'did', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs', 'However', 'one', 'twist', 'movie', 'be', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'sort', 'surprise', 'kind', 'dissapointment', 'considering', 'Shyamalan', 'been', 'role', 'film', 'still', 'full', 'twists', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'till', 'end', 'did', 'me.The', 'main', 'plot', 'village', 'people', 'set', 'sometime', '1800', 'are', 'completely', 'cut', 'off', 'world', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'surrounded', 'woods', 'where', 'creatures', 'also', 'live', 'in.At', 'first', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'fact', 'are', 'called', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'townsfolk', 'also', 'fact', 'are', 'attracted', 'color', 'red', 'color', 'clothes', 'berries', 'flowers', 'color', 'called', 'bad', 'color', 'buried', 'ground', 'right', 'away', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'village', 'people', 'village', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'woods', 'creatures', 'woods', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'village.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Lucius', 'quiet', 'young', 'man', 'not', 'fear', 'creatures', 'fact', 'not', 'fear', 'anything', 'saftey', 'will', 'talk', 'later.As', 'far', 'plot', 'concerned', 'Lucius', 'only', 'first', 'half', 'man', 'who', 'write', 'out', 'what', 'say', 'order', 'actually', 'say', 'it.When', 'dead', 'animals', 'start', 'show', 'up', 'village', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', 'creatures', 'are', 'starting', 'break', 'truce', 'have', 'people', 'first', 'pretend', 'acts', 'are', 'coyotes', 'when', 'more', 'more', 'start', 'showing', 'up', 'people', 'start', 'worry', 'even', 'more.Despite', 'fact', 'movie', 'try', 'stick', 'plotline', 'several', 'moments', 'were', 'pretty', 'slow', 'Shyamalan', 'keep', 'interesting', 'showing', 'several', 'moments', 'suspense', 'only', 'can', 'deliver', 'including', 'few', 'seconds', 'actually', 'seeing', 'creatures', 'light', 'believe', 'are', 'nothing', 'what', 'will', 'expect.Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'acting', 'debut', 'believe', 'movie', 'Ivy', 'daughter', 'leader', 'town', 'who', 'also', 'blind', 'remarkable', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'lot', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'cant', 'great', 'movie', 'also', 'character', 'Lucius', 'afraid', 'safety.And', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'Pianist', 'did', 'actually', 'think', 'would', 'see', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'character', 'here', 'Kind', 'real', 'shocker', 'think', 'it.As', 'scary', 'scenes', 'definately', 'deliver', 'opinion', 'are', 'relatively', 'evened', 'out', 'movie', 'first', 'hour', 'rearely', 'scene', 'woods', 'Ivy', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'were', 'suspensful', 'was', 'daylight', 'too.The', 'ending', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'definately', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'same', 'level', 'Shyamalan', 'others', 'everyone', 'take', 'break', 'now', 'then', 'right', 'Anyway', 'great', 'movie', 'rent', 'definately', 'not', 'worth', 'throwing', 'trash']",N/A
860270,A1DQZBHEU98PBT,B00064LJVE,Theresa W,"[4, 5]","While I heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie, being a huge fan of every other M. Night movie, I of course HAD to go see ""The Village""!  And over-all the experience was good, not great, but good.First let me tell you what the movie is about- a village filled with people who have decided to live in something similar to a commune- with basically no contact with the rest of the world. Suddenly their happy existence seems to be ruined by what appears to be some kind of creature that is killing animals, leaving the village people in fear for their safety. Featured in the cast are a group of coming-of-age teens among the towns ""elders"" who are more than a bit curious of the outside world and why the two lifestyles can't mix.Was it a scary movie? Yes, at points. Did the ""twist"" at the ending shock me? Yes. Was I a little disappointed with the movie over-all? Yes. Was it worth the money? Yes. Do I still think M. Knight rocks? Yes!Now, let me say that I think a lot of people are so disappointed with this movie is that the twist isn't as big as the one in the Sixth Sense. Or as scary as Signs. But here's a tid-bit for you, a writer is not going to write all of his scripts the same! I know it's shocking for some, but Knights movies don't always have to have a twist at the end! I think that because of the Sixth Sense, people just expect that from him and have pigeon-holed him. And obviously for each writer there will always be one masterpiece that stands out and some work that isn't as good as the rest. I think The Village is not his best work, but I didn't think Unbreakable was either. However, I still enjoyed both movies in their own right. As far as the twist goes, I am pretty good at guessing endings and I did NOT guess this one. My mouth was actually gaping open...but maybe that was just because I was so into the movie I wasn't waiting for a twist. And when you're waiting for a twist, that is usually what ruins it. It can never live up to what's inside your mind.One thing that was a bit hidden in this movie was the THEME. I guess it might have been that you can't hide from evil- you must face it?  The theme in this movie is not as obvious to me as it has been in other movies. As far as the plot goes, I think it was quite original and creative. I can't think of another movie that it reminds me of. Also, there were several surprises through-out the movie, or developments that definitely kept me hanging on the edge of my seat to see what was going to happen.

860272,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00064LJVE,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[1, 3]","Director:  M. Night ShyamalanCast:  Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, Judy Greer, Cherry Jones.Running Time:  108 minutesRated PG-13 for a scene of violence, intense situations, and brief language.M. Night Shyamalan definitely did himself a disservice in releasing ""The Sixth Sense"". Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director. And so, Shyamalan has been trying with every single outing since to recapture that sense of awe.  ""Signs"", another incredibly produced chiller with a magnificent resolution showed his growth both as a screenwriter and director.  With ""The Village"", the director attempts to bring several different layers into the film (including perhaps the September 11, 2001 inspired innocence versus corruption theme), but eventually this stylish shocker falls flat on its face due to a disoriented finale.  The movie revolves around a community which is almost Amish in its characteristics, as the villagers are self sufficient in their world. It features a great cast (led by William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and Brendon Gleeson); however, the talent is so wastefully squandered with too rare, fleeting moments of interaction.The elders of the community (Hurt, Weaver, Gleeson and others) have prohibited the villagers to venture into the surrounding woods, as there are ""Creatures of which we do not speak"" living within. They wear red hoods and red is a color which they are not allowed to cast their eyes upon. The community is in turn paralyzed by fear. As history would have it, there has been bad, spilt blood with these creatures and a truce was called. The promise of the truce is that neither party is not allowed to set foot into the other's territory, or else it will be considered void.  When one of the villagers fall victim to a violent crime, the town turns to a blind woman named Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) to venture into the woods and retrieve medicine from a neighboring settlement.""The Village"" begins ominous and promising, yet there are only a few genuine scenes which make you jump out of your skin. But at the core of all the monsters, darkness, and hysteria is a deeply moving love story between Luscious (Joaquin Phoenix) and Ivy, which the Shyamalan allocates a good deal of time to gain speed as the spookier stuff rolls out. At its heart, ""The Village"" is a costume drama exploring the microcosm of this tiny population that is entirely reliant on each other.  The film is most appealing stepping back and watching these characters interact, captured with Shyamalan's meticulous, mannered camera moves and pace, never breathing too deeply or trying too hard, outside of his clunky dialog.  Despite his failings as writer here, director Shymalan and his cinematographer do well here and produce a film that looks great and manages to produce some images that are memorable and effective.The cast try hard but, with few characters to go around, many of their characters are left underdeveloped and enigmatic.  Phoenix's performance is fitting to the slow tone of the film and he tries hard but he is betrayed and left with nothing to do. Howard steals the film with stupendous effectiveness and charm.  Her actions may grate as they seem so very unlikely but her actual performance is very good and she makes a good heart of the film once she is moved into that position in the second half. Brody is only adequate, but is just a plot device to get to the twist. Hurt is strong and delivers well, but people like Weaver and Gleeson really deserve better; they have nothing to do and what little material they have to work with (e.g. Weaver and Hurt's affection) is only out there to fill and distract.  A visually stunning and moderately scary political stab at the genre, yet overall the film leaves the audience with a strange sense of deception.",3,The Village  (2004),1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,3990,"['Director', 'M.', 'Night', 'ShyamalanCast', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Cherry', 'Jones.Running', 'Time', '108', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'scene', 'violence', 'intense', 'situations', 'brief', 'language.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'definitely', 'did', 'disservice', 'releasing', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Brilliant', 'film', 'was', 'twist', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'world', 'expected', 'nothing', 'less', 'talented', 'young', 'director', 'so', 'Shyamalan', 'been', 'trying', 'single', 'outing', 'recapture', 'sense', 'awe', 'Signs', 'incredibly', 'produced', 'chiller', 'magnificent', 'resolution', 'showed', 'growth', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'Village', 'director', 'attempts', 'bring', 'several', 'different', 'layers', 'film', 'including', 'perhaps', 'September', '11', '2001', 'inspired', 'innocence', 'versus', 'corruption', 'theme', 'eventually', 'stylish', 'shocker', 'flat', 'face', 'due', 'disoriented', 'finale', 'movie', 'around', 'community', 'almost', 'Amish', 'characteristics', 'villagers', 'are', 'self', 'sufficient', 'world', 'great', 'cast', 'led', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Brendon', 'Gleeson', 'however', 'talent', 'so', 'wastefully', 'squandered', 'too', 'rare', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'interaction.The', 'elders', 'community', 'Hurt', 'Weaver', 'Gleeson', 'others', 'have', 'prohibited', 'villagers', 'venture', 'surrounding', 'woods', 'are', 'Creatures', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'living', 'wear', 'red', 'hoods', 'red', 'color', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'cast', 'eyes', 'community', 'turn', 'paralyzed', 'fear', 'history', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'spilt', 'blood', 'creatures', 'truce', 'was', 'called', 'promise', 'truce', 'party', 'not', 'allowed', 'set', 'foot', 'other', 'territory', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'void', 'When', 'one', 'villagers', 'fall', 'victim', 'violent', 'crime', 'town', 'blind', 'woman', 'named', 'Ivy', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'venture', 'woods', 'retrieve', 'medicine', 'neighboring', 'settlement', 'Village', 'ominous', 'promising', 'yet', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'genuine', 'scenes', 'make', 'jump', 'skin', 'core', 'monsters', 'darkness', 'hysteria', 'deeply', 'moving', 'love', 'story', 'Luscious', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Ivy', 'Shyamalan', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'gain', 'speed', 'spookier', 'stuff', 'out', 'heart', 'Village', 'costume', 'drama', 'exploring', 'microcosm', 'tiny', 'population', 'entirely', 'reliant', 'other', 'film', 'most', 'appealing', 'stepping', 'back', 'watching', 'characters', 'interact', 'captured', 'Shyamalan', 'meticulous', 'mannered', 'camera', 'moves', 'pace', 'never', 'breathing', 'too', 'deeply', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'clunky', 'dialog', 'failings', 'writer', 'here', 'director', 'Shymalan', 'cinematographer', 'do', 'well', 'here', 'produce', 'film', 'great', 'manages', 'produce', 'images', 'are', 'memorable', 'effective.The', 'cast', 'try', 'hard', 'few', 'characters', 'go', 'around', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'underdeveloped', 'enigmatic', 'Phoenix', 'performance', 'fitting', 'slow', 'tone', 'film', 'hard', 'betrayed', 'left', 'nothing', 'do', 'Howard', 'film', 'stupendous', 'effectiveness', 'charm', 'actions', 'may', 'grate', 'seem', 'so', 'very', 'unlikely', 'actual', 'performance', 'very', 'good', 'good', 'heart', 'film', 'moved', 'position', 'second', 'half', 'Brody', 'only', 'adequate', 'just', 'plot', 'device', 'get', 'twist', 'Hurt', 'strong', 'delivers', 'well', 'people', 'Weaver', 'Gleeson', 'really', 'deserve', 'better', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'what', 'little', 'material', 'have', 'work', 'e.g', 'Weaver', 'Hurt', 'affection', 'only', 'out', 'there', 'fill', 'distract', 'visually', 'stunning', 'moderately', 'scary', 'political', 'stab', 'genre', 'yet', 'overall', 'film', 'audience', 'strange', 'sense', 'deception']",N/A

I liked it and liked the plot twists, however it does leave one with many unanswered questions. I rented the DVD and it has cool extras on it, too bad the extras do not have the answers. In the beginning of the movie, it appears that a child has died and the year is 18-something. Okay, so he died from what? And after the funeral all the villagers have a big meal on really long tables ??? After the party where do they store the tables ? If the woods are full of dudes that are ""not spoken of"" wearing Little Red Riding Hood capes, just how did the ""settlers"" get to this large clearing smack dab in the middle of the woods and then build a village? Are they really aliens and a spaceship just dropped them off with their supplies? Who kept skinning foxes and sticking them around to scare the youngins' ? That's gross. Besides, if the woods were really full of red-cloaked freaks, wouldn't the Elders have made weapons of some sort and not just have everyone hide in their cellars? Perhaps the Elders knew something that the audience didn't. Oh that's right, they did knew something, a lot of something. William Hurt played the part of the head Village Elder, and yet when medicine is needed to help a young man who is suffering stab wounds, he sends his BLIND daughter into the woods to travel to the ""towns"" to try and get some. Just what was he thinking? She was blind ! I mean he knew (but the audience still didn't), that there were no animals (at all) and no freaks in the woods, but she was still blind and could have fallen down a big muddy hole and got killed or something. Was he hoping either that she would get lucky and the miracle would happen - she would find some compassionate soul who would get her the goods and help her back into the woods and since she was blind could never tell anyone that the whole village scenario is a sham, or worse, she would be lost forever and die from exposure, which would basically send a message to the rest of the Village, an ""I told you so""??? We were supposed to believe that the villagers were living a primitive life yet it seemed like they did not go without much - they even managed to find beads to decorate a tent for a wedding.The movie was entertaining and the twist at the end was definitely not predictable to me, however it just left me with too many unanswered questions. I did like most of the characters and thought Joaquim Phoenix is eye candy. Bryce (cool name) Howard played a convincing blind Ivy, she was lovely and had an awesome voice - just to listen to her speak was a delight. Adrian Brody as the village idiot was rather annoying, however he was the perfect actor for the part since he seemed to have no trouble playing an idiot. Had he not perished after falling in the mud hole, perhaps he would have benefited from a little medication as well. I could understand his parents anquish after his death, however you just can't have dudes running around like that stabbing people and trying to scare the hell out of people. In the real world we have jails for those who commit crimes, or in his case institutions. In the village, all they had was a ""quiet room"", which as we all saw, was not too affective. And when you are trying to scare your community into believing that they need to remain in the village and never venture into the woods, it's probably not a good idea to hide one of your freak suits under the floor boards of the ""quiet room"", since that was where the village idiot spent a lot of his time.At the end some of the answers came to light, however it just left other questions. The score was beautifully done and watching the behind the scenes clips on the DVD were cool. At least it seemed that the actors had a good time filming it - or Night wants us to think they did. The home video that Night includes on the DVD is lame to say the least. I felt it was just more of him being proud of himself (another pat on the back to himself). He is still young so maybe he has yet to realize that true fame comes from others admiring your work and not from you just thinking that everything you do is great. Other than that I would say if you are a collector of his movies, buy it for your collection, if not pop some popcorn and just rent it.",4,"Never mind M.Night, just sit back and enjoy.",1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,4422,"['hype', 'fact', 'M.Night', 'oddly', 'need', 'have', 'name', 'lights', 'movie', 'titles', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', '3', 'spent', 'rent', 'liked', 'liked', 'plot', 'twists', 'however', 'leave', 'one', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'rented', 'DVD', 'cool', 'extras', 'too', 'bad', 'extras', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'answers', 'beginning', 'movie', 'child', 'died', 'year', '18-something', 'Okay', 'died', 'what', 'funeral', 'villagers', 'have', 'big', 'meal', 'really', 'long', 'tables', 'party', 'where', 'do', 'store', 'tables', 'woods', 'are', 'full', 'dudes', 'are', 'not', 'spoken', 'wearing', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'capes', 'just', 'how', 'did', 'settlers', 'get', 'large', 'clearing', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'woods', 'then', 'build', 'village', 'Are', 'really', 'aliens', 'spaceship', 'just', 'dropped', 'off', 'supplies', 'Who', 'kept', 'skinning', 'foxes', 'sticking', 'scare', 'youngins', 'gross', 'woods', 'were', 'really', 'full', 'red-cloaked', 'freaks', 'would', ""n't"", 'Elders', 'have', 'made', 'weapons', 'sort', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'everyone', 'hide', 'cellars', 'Perhaps', 'Elders', 'knew', 'something', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'Oh', 'right', 'did', 'knew', 'something', 'lot', 'something', 'William', 'Hurt', 'played', 'part', 'head', 'Village', 'Elder', 'yet', 'when', 'medicine', 'needed', 'help', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'suffering', 'stab', 'wounds', 'BLIND', 'daughter', 'woods', 'travel', 'towns', 'try', 'get', 'Just', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'blind', 'mean', 'knew', 'audience', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'were', 'animals', 'freaks', 'woods', 'was', 'still', 'blind', 'could', 'have', 'fallen', 'down', 'big', 'muddy', 'hole', 'got', 'killed', 'something', 'hoping', 'would', 'get', 'lucky', 'miracle', 'would', 'happen', 'would', 'find', 'compassionate', 'soul', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'goods', 'help', 'back', 'woods', 'was', 'blind', 'could', 'never', 'tell', 'anyone', 'whole', 'village', 'scenario', 'sham', 'worse', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'forever', 'die', 'exposure', 'would', 'basically', 'send', 'message', 'rest', 'Village', 'told', 'were', 'supposed', 'believe', 'villagers', 'were', 'living', 'primitive', 'life', 'yet', 'seemed', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'much', 'even', 'managed', 'find', 'beads', 'decorate', 'tent', 'wedding.The', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'predictable', 'however', 'just', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'did', 'most', 'characters', 'thought', 'Joaquim', 'Phoenix', 'eye', 'candy', 'Bryce', 'cool', 'name', 'Howard', 'played', 'convincing', 'blind', 'Ivy', 'was', 'lovely', 'had', 'awesome', 'voice', 'just', 'listen', 'speak', 'was', 'delight', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'village', 'idiot', 'was', 'rather', 'annoying', 'however', 'was', 'perfect', 'actor', 'part', 'seemed', 'have', 'trouble', 'playing', 'idiot', 'Had', 'not', 'perished', 'falling', 'mud', 'hole', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'little', 'medication', 'well', 'could', 'understand', 'parents', 'anquish', 'death', 'however', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'dudes', 'running', 'around', 'stabbing', 'people', 'trying', 'scare', 'hell', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'have', 'jails', 'who', 'commit', 'crimes', 'case', 'institutions', 'village', 'had', 'was', 'quiet', 'room', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'affective', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'scare', 'community', 'believing', 'need', 'remain', 'village', 'never', 'venture', 'woods', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'hide', 'one', 'freak', 'suits', 'floor', 'boards', 'quiet', 'room', 'was', 'where', 'village', 'idiot', 'spent', 'lot', 'time.At', 'end', 'answers', 'came', 'light', 'however', 'just', 'left', 'other', 'questions', 'score', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'watching', 'scenes', 'clips', 'DVD', 'were', 'cool', 'least', 'seemed', 'actors', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'filming', 'Night', 'think', 'did', 'home', 'video', 'Night', 'DVD', 'lame', 'say', 'least', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'being', 'proud', 'pat', 'back', 'still', 'young', 'so', 'maybe', 'yet', 'realize', 'true', 'fame', 'others', 'admiring', 'work', 'not', 'just', 'thinking', 'everything', 'do', 'great', 'Other', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'collector', 'movies', 'buy', 'collection', 'not', 'pop', 'popcorn', 'just', 'rent']",N/A

My friend - based on viewing the trailers alone - wrote what he thought the ending of The Village would be as the opening credits rolled. Maybe 30 minutes into the film, terribly bored, we were chatting and I offered my guess how it would end, almost as a joke. He showed me his slip of paper with his written guess. They agreed. And so did M. N. Shyamalan apparently because we were right.That about sums up The Village. It's the most predictable movie I've seen in years. With predictability comes a complete loss of tension. All that's left is the acting, subplots, and scenery. None of which are worth the cost of a rental, really.We're introduced to an isolated village reminiscent of a Mennonites or some other religious sect. Shymalan has done a credible job putting together the culture with two irritating habits: their dialog is stilted to sound like a bad mockery of Shakespeare and their endless deadpan expressions staring off into space drain all life from their performances. Janquin Phoenix's talents are totally wasted. His wooden performance is absolutely painful to watch. The young women of the village are mysteriously enamored of him despite the fact he stares off into the distance brooding as they express their love.Shyamalan skips the subtlety that made Sixth Sense such a surprise ending. He telegraphs from the beginning that some mystery resides in the woods forcing the viewer to figure out the puzzle. The village has an uneasy peace with those whose name they won't speak. They are not to venture into the woods. But the elders and most of the villagers appear content in their isolation. Figured the ending out yet? I won't give away any other clues because two or three more of the not so subtle hints Shyamalan gives you and you've figured it out. For those too slow to take the hint, with a lot of time remaining, he reveals the truth yet the last third of the movie relies on creating tension that a principal character - to whom the secret was revealed as it was to the audience - is still befuddled and afraid by those whom we don't speak of.Oh, what an awful mess. It really deserves 1 1/2 stars, not 1, because it wasn't so bad I couldn't make my way through it but, overall, it was so dull I was glad when it was over so I can't manage 2.

This will dissappoint many because, well it's just not how they wanted it to be. THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM PEOPLE! IT'S NOT SCARY!!! So don't go in expecting such. The Village is a thrilling tale of an isolated village confronting the astonishing truth that lies just outside its borders. At first glance, this village seems picture perfect, but this close-knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding woods. The evil and foreboding force is so unnerving that none dare venture beyond the borders of the village and into the woods. But when curious, headstrong Lucius Hunt plans to step beyond the boundaries of the town and into the unknown, his bold move threatens to forever change the future of the village.

Well, we can just chalk that up to being a new father, buy the film on DVD, and move on. So that's what I did.I've been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan for quite awhile. Signs is really the only film of his that dissappointed me, largely due to the fact that there was no surprise twist at the end. Instead, everything seemed to come together to mean something. Not a terrible movie in general, but not quite like his other works.But this is a review of The Village. Excellent movie.SPOILERS AHEADI have to lay claim to guessing what was coming, however. I didn't know exactly how it was going to play out, but I decided early on that the biggest thing I was taking for granted was that this film took place in colonial times. So I figured I was probably wrong. Thankfully, M. Night did not disappoint. I really liked how this aspect of the film played out.The cameo by Shyamalan was also well done, although it was easy to see if you were looking for it. If you didn't notice, he was the guy behind the desk in the office.The making of features on this DVD were absolutely fantastic, far above and beyond what is put on the majority of DVDs these days. Excluding the price gouging special editions, of course.As always, Shyamalan included one of his films he made as a child. This time, it was a take-off on Indiana Jones, which was funny and amazing at the same time. Shyamalan had a lot of talent from a young age. Good stuff to look back on now.Even as a fan of M.

860283,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00064LJVE,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","The Village is one of the more reviled films of recent years but for me, much to my surprise, one of the best. People tend to describe Shyamalan's films as overblown Twilight Zone episodes, but in fact they're closer to The Outer Limits. Where Twilight's half-hour format reduced most stories to basic ""What if?"" shaggy dog stories (albeit darn good ones), Limits' longer running time gave them the freedom to ask ""What would it be like?"" and concentrate on the characters experiencing extraordinary events. The Village is certainly more character-based than plot-led, with the film's real twist not being the nature of Those We Do Not Speak Of but the fact that it's not ostensible leading man Joaquin Phoenix's story but Bryce Dallas Howard's, and that it's not a horror film at all but a quietly affecting love story. More surprising too is that for the first time Shyamalan reveals himself to be a surprisingly good writer for women, with Howard's part one of the best for a leading actress in a mainstream film in years.Some of the dialog is a little awkward in pastiching 19th century literature rather than 19th century speech, but the cast of mainly classically trained stage actors manage to sell all but the most awkwardly constructed sentences. Indeed, the use of language and the constant double meanings in lines such as ""We are grateful for the time we have been given"" is surprisingly important and shows that there's a literate intelligence at work here, not something that can usually be said for summer movies. Just as interesting is Shyamalan's emphasis on body language and unspoken communication - beyond the surprising attraction of a blind character for one who virtually never speaks, the film is littered with little touches that tell much, such as Sigourney Weaver noticing that William Hurt not touching her proffered hand is a far more intimate and loving act than taking it. In fact, as a filmmaking it's in a completely different league to his previous films, with a beautiful use of color (especially surprising after the sombre muted tones of his earlier films) and design, superb editing, strong performances and a good eye for a memorable image, be it two girls spinning around as they sweep the porch or the torchlit shots of the watchtower on the edge of the woods. A nod to James Newton Howard's restrained but surprisingly emotive scoring too. Very impressive indeed despite a few awkward patches.The DVD offers a fine 1.85:1 transfer that compliments Roger Deakins' superb cinematography as well as a good selection of extras.",5,"Surprisingly good, but not a horror film and not for all tastes",1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,2565,"['Village', 'one', 'more', 'reviled', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'much', 'surprise', 'one', 'best', 'People', 'tend', 'describe', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'overblown', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'fact', ""'re"", 'closer', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Where', 'Twilight', 'half-hour', 'format', 'reduced', 'most', 'stories', 'basic', 'What', 'dog', 'stories', 'darn', 'good', 'ones', 'Limits', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'gave', 'freedom', 'ask', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'concentrate', 'characters', 'experiencing', 'extraordinary', 'events', 'Village', 'certainly', 'more', 'character-based', 'plot-led', 'film', 'real', 'twist', 'not', 'being', 'nature', 'Do', 'Not', 'Speak', 'fact', 'not', 'ostensible', 'leading', 'man', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'story', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'quietly', 'affecting', 'love', 'story', 'More', 'surprising', 'too', 'first', 'time', 'Shyamalan', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'writer', 'women', 'Howard', 'part', 'one', 'best', 'leading', 'actress', 'mainstream', 'film', 'years.Some', 'dialog', 'little', 'awkward', 'pastiching', '19th', 'century', 'literature', 'rather', '19th', 'century', 'speech', 'cast', 'mainly', 'classically', 'trained', 'stage', 'actors', 'manage', 'sell', 'most', 'awkwardly', 'constructed', 'sentences', 'Indeed', 'use', 'language', 'constant', 'double', 'meanings', 'lines', 'such', 'are', 'grateful', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'surprisingly', 'important', 'literate', 'intelligence', 'work', 'here', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'usually', 'be', 'said', 'summer', 'movies', 'Just', 'interesting', 'Shyamalan', 'emphasis', 'body', 'language', 'unspoken', 'communication', 'surprising', 'attraction', 'blind', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'virtually', 'never', 'film', 'littered', 'little', 'touches', 'tell', 'much', 'such', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'noticing', 'William', 'Hurt', 'not', 'touching', 'proffered', 'hand', 'far', 'more', 'intimate', 'loving', 'act', 'taking', 'fact', 'filmmaking', 'completely', 'different', 'league', 'previous', 'films', 'beautiful', 'use', 'color', 'especially', 'surprising', 'sombre', 'muted', 'tones', 'earlier', 'films', 'design', 'superb', 'editing', 'strong', 'performances', 'good', 'eye', 'memorable', 'image', 'be', 'two', 'girls', 'spinning', 'around', 'sweep', 'porch', 'torchlit', 'shots', 'watchtower', 'edge', 'woods', 'nod', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'restrained', 'surprisingly', 'emotive', 'scoring', 'too', 'Very', 'impressive', 'indeed', 'few', 'awkward', 'patches.The', 'DVD', 'fine', '1.85:1', 'transfer', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'selection', 'extras']",N/A

860286,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00064LJVE,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","In THE VILLAGE, the people in a small, rural Pennsylvania town of yesteryear have a pact with creatures who live in the woods surrounding the village. The townspeople stay out of the woods and the creatures stay out of the village. But then the creatures begin appearing in the village. No one knows why. Strange and unusual events occur more frequently until an attempted murder is made upon one of the village's most promising future leaders, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix). In order to save the young man's life, the pact must be broken. A young woman risks everything to save Lucius' life and protect the village.The acting is full of emotion, yet restrained; realistic and not melodramatic. I especially found the performances of Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker and Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius Hunt to be especially rewarding. As a bonus the film also has Adrien Brody playing a mentally challenged and psychopathic young man named Noah Percy.Shyamalan's direction of the images, light, and sound in the movie is first rate. There aren't many directors who can or are willing to get as much depth and emotion from one sound or image as Shyamalan can. A single sound (such as a howl in the woods) or a single image (a figured cloaked in red) creates more of a suspense and chill than any expensive special effect could. Shyamalan has definitely learned from Hitchcock, the person who his work owes the most to. The human imagination is so much more powerful than what can be shown on the screen.There are many who have complained about the seeming let down of the &#34;twists&#34; in THE VILLAGE. I figured out one of the main twists less than 15 minutes into the movie. Yet, even though I knew what was going to happen, my enjoyment of the movie wasn't lessened at all. In fact, my appreciation for the film increased. THE VILLAGE really isn't a scary film at all, and nor should it be classified as a thriller. Instead, it's a love story and one of the best love stories I've watched in a long time. The love that is shared between Lucius and Ivy is a love that is strong, purposeful, and realistic. In our modern world, we've grown shallow in our ideas of love and even in how we actually love other people. THE VILLAGE is a testament to real love. It shows us what it really means to love another person. In the postmodern, fast food, supersized, commercialized culture in which we live, everything is about me. Love really has very little to do with me, but has everything to do with the other person. That's something we need to hear more and more often. Our hearts have been hijacked and it's time we get them back.I really enjoyed THE VILLAGE. It's one of the best love stories to come out in a long time. Not only that, but there are a ton of religious and spiritual messages scattered throughout the film. A person could even watch THE VILLAGE as a religious allegory full of Biblical allusions. I'm not sure what Shyamalan's faith is, but I do know that he is making some of the most powerful religious movies today. After tackling the issues of accepting one's identity in THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, exploring the nature of faith in SIGNS, and now examining charity and hope in THE VILLAGE, I am quite curious to see what Christian virtue Shyamalan delves into next.This DVD edition of THE VILLAGE includes several deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes--including a home movie taken my M. Night Shyamalan, and production photos. I enjoyed watching the featurettes.

860292,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B00064LJVE,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[5, 8]","M. Night Shamalyan is one of my favourite directors of all time. Seriously, I love almost all this stuff. Of course the Sixth Sense was great (bless that little boy!), and I thought the tragically underrated &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was actually even better than &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;. &quot;Signs&quot; is a great thriller until the somewhat lame and anticlimactic ending.That said, I was highly psyched to go see &quot;the Village&quot;, and like everyone else I was mislead by the commercials that this was gonna be an edge-of-your-seat horror movie. I even read reviews that said &quot;don't watch this movie as a horror movie, or you'll be disappointed&quot;. I just couldn't shake the notion in my head that this was a horror movie, and lo and behold, I was greatly disappointed and felt let down by the ending. If you felt completely SOLD OUT by the ending, I feel for ya buddy! I was there too!If you had asked me to write this Amazon review the moment I walked out of the theatre, I would have given it a 2, maybe 3 tops. The problem with &quot;the Village&quot; is that of course (as you've no doubt heard by now) it's not a horror movie! But I think the even bigger problem is that director Shamalyan gives us, the audience, WAY too much credit. Puh-leez, we are NOT that smart! I was of course intelliegent enough to piece together the first 'twist' from all the (disappointed) reviews I read. The second twist came as quite a surprise, and was accompanied by a 'WTF!!??' However, angered viewer, don't pass judgement right there in the theatre. Go home, eat dinner, and let the second, final twist marinate in your brain for awhile. And a third, crucial key point of the movie went completely over my head until hours after seeing the movie. Shamalyan doesn't explain it and just expects you to 'figure it out' on your own. Again, givin' us too much credit here, M. Night! I can't tell you what the key point is of course, but let me just say this: Isn't it absurd they'd send out a defenceless blind girl out into the woods alone? (Her escorts were ordered not to go onto the road, even if they didn't chicken out). Yes...it is absurd...ergo there must be a reason. Think about it. The key word is 'think'.If I had to pick one phrase to describe &quot;the Village&quot;, it would have to be: &quot;Makes you think&quot;. The movie makes you think harder than any film has the right to. This movie will ultimately fail in the box office (although technically it's #1 this week, but you just wait!) I don't think America, or any country for that matter, is ready for this movie. This isn't entertainment, it's a senior thesis project on sociology.My critique of the technical aspects of the movie: The cinematography is gorgeous; in fact I may go see the movie again just to dunk my head into the imagery and 'feel' of the movie again. Or I may go see it again to see Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy)'s cute, freckled face again, ha ha. Either is good with me. The few scenes that were scary were done with chilling effectiveness.The acting is very uneven. This movie contains some of the best and worst acting I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Bravo to Shamalyan for choosing to make a pretty, naive blind girl (as one of the professional reviewers put it: &quot;innocent without looking virginal&quot;) as the real hero and main character of the movie, instead of hollywood pretty-boy who will triumph through the physical prowess that only a man can possess (relax, I'm being sarcastic). I always enjoy movies with a &quot;real&quot;, believeable female protagonist. Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) represents a kind of real girl power, as opposed to cheesy, pandering absurdities a la &quot;Charlie's Angles&quot;. Howard, apart from being utterly adorable and very pretty (I have a weakness for redheads with freckles), is mesmerising and enthralling to watch on screen as she plays her character with genuine emotion and subtle perfection. Like a master pianist performing her craft, Dallas Howard doesn't hit a single false note, and does so with no pretention. This is a textbook example of how to not overdo a performance. Just watch her. Joaquin Phoenix is decent, also going for the subtle, quiet approach. Unfortunatley we don't get to see much of him, and his character remains under-developed. But if that's the price we have to pay to see more of Howard, then away with Phoenix! That said, every other performance was quite dismal. Conversations were stunted and forced, and everything felt very artificial. I truly expected better from veteran actor William Hurt. Shame on you!Aside from being a graduate-level sociology thesis, at the heart of this movie is also a touching love story about the lengths that said adorable blind girl will go for l'amor. Really, after seeing this movie, you will think to yourself, &quot;wow, now THAT'S love. Now where can I find a girl like that?&quot; So, let's recap: sociology project, love story. Nothing about horror or thriller. Got it? Good. I know you'll still go see the movie expecting it to scare you. (God knows I did. Doesn't matter how many reviews you read telling you it's not). The commercials are powerful, and the notions are set deep. And certain parts of the movie WILL give you a jump, for the time being at least. All I can say is, give this movie a chance. After seeing it you WILL hate it, but if you let it sit and marinate for awhile, maybe you'll start to like it more and more. And that's really not bad for a movie, since I know many movies that become more and more awlful the longer you think about them (like the Star Wars prequels).One last note: prior to seeing &quot;the Village&quot; I was well-aware of M. Night Shamalyan's propensity to copy Hitchcock and give himself a cameo in every movie. Since this movie is set in 1890's rural America, where no Indians (from India) were, I thought that there would be no way Shamalyan could continue his tradition. Well, you'll be surprised. Just see. And think about it.",4,Too smart for its own good; this movie will die,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,6009,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shamalyan', 'one', 'favourite', 'directors', 'time', 'Seriously', 'love',

The speculation is rife with the theory that Shyamalan in The Village has made the same point Michael Moore made in Fahrenheit 9/11. The point being made is that when people are afraid you can control them easier. The Village says ""Those we don't speak of"" are the ""enemy"" and we must look out for them. We will ""alert"" the rest when they are sighted because that is when ""terror"" is near.Fear of the other side, fear of the unknown, fear of an enemy, real or imagined are useful to ""those who know"". If you use fear cleverly you can shunt people's independent thought process for either personal gain, or cementing your own insecurities. The Village elders were not bent on power but on protecting their families from experiencing human cruelty. They didn't succeed did they?There are some subtle messages, which Shyamalan delivers through The Village.Regardless of all good intentions, when fear is used as a weapon to constantly beat someone into submission you destroy his human spirit.You cannot escape the inevitability of human suffering no matter how far you run or how deep you bury your head in the sand.",4,Fear is The Key,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,1177,"['Now', 'dust', 'settled', 'subtle', 'insights', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'speculation', 'rife', 'theory', 'Shyamalan', 'Village', 'made', 'same', 'point', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'made', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', 'can', 'control', 'easier', 'Village', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'are', 'enemy', 'must', 'look', 'out', 'will', 'alert', 'rest', 'when', 'are', 'sighted', 'when', 'terror', 'near.Fear', 'other', 'side', 'fear', 'unknown', 'fear', 'enemy', 'real', 'imagined', 'are', 'useful', 'who', 'know', 'use', 'fear', 'cleverly', 'can', 'shunt', 'people', 'independent', 'thought', 'process', 'personal', 'gain', 'cementing', 'own', 'insecurities', 'Village', 'elders', 'were', 'not', 'bent', 'power', 'protecting', 'families', 'experiencing', 'human', 'cruelty', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'did', 'are', 'subtle', 'messages', 'Shyamalan', 'Village.Regardless', 'good', 'intentions', 'when', 'fear', 'used', 'weapon', 'constantly', 'beat', 'someone', 'submission', 'destroy', 'human', 'spirit.You', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'inevitability', 'human', 'suffering', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'run', 'how', 'deep', 'bury', 'head', 'sand']",N/A

Night Shyamalan morphed into the Rod Serling of movies, he made very funny and clever short amateur films. Why do I bring this up? Because Shyamalan's film plays like an extended version of ""The Twilight Zone"" and his amateur films were imitations of the film directors he admired (Spielberg for one). You may figure out ""The Village"" before the end like I did but even if you figure out the ending, ""The Village"" remains a suspeneful ride for its duration.Set in an isolated, small rural town with homes straight out of the early 18th century, ""The Village"" the people live in is surround by woods where mythical beasts live. The townspeople and the creatures developed an alliance early on; the peole of the village will never venture into the woods and, in turn, the creatures will remain in the woods. As long as this balance exists, the two can peacefully co-exist. Things change with the death of a little boy. When the death occurs Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)offers to brave the woods and go to the nearest town for vitally needed medicines. Ivy Hunt (the marvelous Bryce Dallas Howard who gives a wonderful performance)is the only other person in the town thaan Lucius who seems without fear. Ivy's blindness also gives her a unique perception of others. The elders of the town including Edward Walker (William Hurt), August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson) and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) all seem against the idea of leaving the village particularly when the creatures start showing up in the village at night. It seems as if their fragile truce and existence will be coming to an end.A well constructed suspense thriller ""The Village"" shares much in common with Shyamalan's other thrillers ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs""). Although the formula of at the heart of his films might be wearing a bit thin for critics, filmgoers will enjoy ""The Village"" for the atmospheric world that Shyamalan dreams up. The suspenseful pacing, twists & turns in the plot and strong performances by the cast will make ""The Village"" memorable. It's a worthwhile film even if a bit predictable by the conclusion of the film. I have to give Shyamalan credit he reveals a key plot point 2/3rds through the movie not unlike Hitchcock did with his classic film ""Vertigo"". It takes tremendous self confidence and as the plot finally begins to take shape, audiences will appreciate it (although some will be mad just as they were at Hitchcock when he made his classic film).The DVD comes with a whole host of special features including deleted scenes, a production photo gallery, Bryce Dallas Howard reading from the diary she kept on set during production and a documentary (broken down into a number of smaller ""featurettes"") called ""Deconstructing The Village"" that takes the viewer step-by-step through the production of the film. We learn, for example, why an early version of the creatures (aka ""Those We Don't Speak Of"")was abandoned as an onset effect. Shyamalan also shares some of his ideas on what makes a movie suspenseful and the cast discusses the symbolism of ""The Village"" and ""Those That We Don't Speak Of"". Shyamalan, like a lot of film directors (most notably Steven Spielberg) didn't want to do a commentary track perhaps fearing tht it might rob the film of its mystique. It's a pity as his working methods during production and abandoned early concepts would have been particularly interesting and wouldn't have hurt the film at all.Take the wooded path and stop in at ""The Village"" where the world isn't quite what it seems. Rod Serling would be proud of the twists, turns and symbolism in ""The Village"" and that's high praise, indeed.

860297,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B00064LJVE,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[6, 7]","The Village is M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film and it's a hard one to review without giving too much away.  Shyamalan has made a niche for himself delivering movies (Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense) that pack a surprise punch at the end, and The Village is no different.The film takes place in a village set in a valley ringed with a forest.  The time is indeterminate, although the clothes are old fashioned, as are the houses and furniture.  There is a shot of a tombstone in the cemetery early on in the film that shows a date of 1897, and the village certainly wouldn't be out of place in the 19th century.  The form of speech of the village citizens is also somewhat archaic.As the story unfolds we learn that the village exists in a state of uneasy truce with the creatures living in the forest around them.  The creatures, whom the villagers refer to as Those of Whom We Do Not Speak, apparently are attracted by the color red, as the villagers shun that color, even going so far to uproot and bury wildflowers of that color.  The villagers maintain a ring of poles with yellow flags by day, and torches by night to keep the creatures out of the village.  They also maintain a watch tower, where a sentry watches through the night.  About all the sentry can do, though, is ring a bell to alert the villagers to hide in their cellars when the creatures decide to enter the town. The village elders, who are the town's governing body, are also concerned about the repeated occurrence of skinned animal carcasses showing up in the valley.That's the background and the starting point of the movie, which is basically about the love between the quiet, soft-spoken Lucious Hunt, well played by Joaquin Phoenix and the independent, but blind, Ivy Walker, wonderfully played by Bryce Dallas Howard.  Both Phoenix and Howard are marvellous in their roles, and are surrounded by a great cast including William Hurt as Ivy's father Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Lucious's mother Alice Hunt and especially Adrien Brody as the mildly retarded Noah Percy.  One of the real treats of this movie is watching how these strong characters interact with each other.Shyamalan did an outstanding job directing the cast, and a phenomenal job of filming.  Every shot is well thought out, and only shows you what he wants you to see.  Especially powerful are the shots of the creatures, for the most part mere suggestions of figures in red, Shyamalan lets your imagination fill in the rest.  The brooding autumnal forest around the valley makes for especially powerful images.  The green and austere village fits in perfectly with it's surroundings.  Shyamalan's use of strange angles really help to create the mood and bring out the best in his storytelling.Above all Shyamalan is a craftsmen, and The Village is a well-crafted film.  Some may guess the secret before the end, but no one can doubt that this is a powerful story of love, well acted, and well filmed.",4,Those of Whom We Do Not Speak,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,2951,"['Village', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'fourth', 'film', 'hard', 'one', 'review', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Shyamalan', 'made', 'niche', 'delivering', 'movies', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'pack', 'surprise', 'punch', 'end', 'Village', 'different.The', 'film', 'place', 'village', 'set', 'valley', 'ringed', 'forest', 'time', 'indeterminate', 'clothes', 'are', 'old', 'fashioned', 'are', 'houses', 'furniture', 'shot', 'tombstone', 'cemetery', 'early', 'film', 'date', '1897', 'village', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'place', '19th', 'century', 'form', 'speech', 'village', 'citizens', 'also', 'somewhat', 'story', 'learn', 'village', 'state', 'uneasy', 'truce', 'creatures', 'living', 'forest', 'creatures', 'whom', 'villagers', 'refer', 'Whom', 'Do', 'Not', 'Speak', 'apparently', 'are', 'attracted', 'color', 'red', 'villagers', 'shun', 'color', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'uproot', 'bury', 'wildflowers', 'color', 'villagers', 'maintain', 'ring', 'poles', 'yellow', 'flags', 'day', 'torches', 'night', 'keep', 'creatures', 'village', 'also', 'maintain', 'watch', 'tower', 'where', 'sentry', 'night', 'sentry', 'can', 'do', 'ring', 'bell', 'alert', 'villagers', 'hide', 'cellars', 'when', 'creatures', 'decide', 'enter', 'town', 'village', 'elders', 'who', 'are', 'town', 'governing', 'body', 'are', 'also', 'concerned', 'repeated', 'occurrence', 'skinned', 'animal', 'carcasses', 'showing', 'up', 'valley.That', 'background', 'starting', 'point', 'movie', 'basically', 'love', 'quiet', 'soft-spoken', 'Lucious', 'Hunt', 'well', 'played', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'independent', 'blind', 'Ivy', 'Walker', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'Phoenix', 'Howard', 'are', 'marvellous', 'roles', 'are', 'surrounded', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Ivy', 'father', 'Edward', 'Walker', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Lucious', 'mother', 'Alice', 'Hunt', 'especially', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'mildly', 'retarded', 'Noah', 'Percy', 'One', 'real', 'treats', 'movie', 'watching', 'how', 'strong', 'characters', 'interact', 'other.Shyamalan', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'directing', 'cast', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'filming', 'shot', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'only', 'what', 'see', 'Especially', 'powerful', 'are', 'shots', 'creatures', 'most', 'part', 'mere', 'suggestions', 'figures', 'red', 'Shyamalan', 'imagination', 'fill', 'rest', 'brooding', 'autumnal', 'forest', 'valley', 'especially', 'powerful', 'images', 'green', 'austere', 'village', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'surroundings', 'Shyamalan', 'use', 'strange', 'angles', 'really', 'help', 'create', 'mood', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'storytelling.Above', 'Shyamalan', 'craftsmen', 'Village', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'may', 'guess', 'secret', 'end', 'one', 'can', 'doubt', 'powerful', 'story', 'love', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'filmed']",N/A

860301,A1H8HHH9WCHZO9,B00064LJVE,"William A Baurle ""WeeWillyWinky""","[2, 2]","M. Night Shyamalan (hereafter referred to as Night) has got himself into pickle, and I suppose maybe it's his own fault. Many people are going into his movies with the single-minded purpose of figuring out the ""twist"", and in the process are not paying enough attention to grasp the more important things. In a sense Night reminds me of the guitarist Buckethead, whose genius shines through the presence of a KFC bucket turned upside-down and an expressionless white mask, at least for those who can look past the bucket and realize that it's irrelevant and only a problem for those who insist on seeing the gimmick instead of listening to the music. Night is known for this gimmick of the surprise ending, and people are ignoring the virtues of his films because they are too focused on the gimmick.**This review will contain spoilers so please read no further if that is an issue for you.**Okay. There are two major revelations in this film, one of which occurs late in the film and the other which occurs at the end. The first revelation, that the creatures -  ""those we do not speak of"" - are not real, is something which I more or less assumed early on. I immediately made a connection with these creatures and the myths of religion. I admit that I didn't know that this myth of the creatures was fabricated by the village elders. Many people consider this a silly premise, even a preposterous one, but given that we live in a world where our ancestors (our elders, if you will) actually have fabricated a massive lie about a mysterious realm populated with demons and a real-live Satan to boot, I find it completely plausible. Not only plausible, but entirely realistic. History is full of efforts by well-intended groups of people to isolate themselves and their loved-ones from the outside world by creating micro-utopias and religious and/or ideological communes of one sort or another. Why people have difficulty accepting this premise is completely beyond me, especially since the film goes to great lengths in exposing the inherent flaws in similar premises and why they almost always fail.The second revelation (or ""twist"", if you must), which is that the film takes place in modern times, is almost entirely irrelevant and adds nothing of great importance. It changes nothing. We already know everything we need to know by the time this revelation occurs, and the story is all but finished. We already know that this community has isolated itself from the outside world because of the disillusionment and fears of those who created it, because of the wild hope that their new world will be purer, better, and safer. When I saw the modern vehicle pulling up to Ivy, the blind girl who is the hero and central character of the film, I wasn't racked with any great surprise. It was a ""meh"" moment. I didn't care much, to tell you the truth. All I cared about was if the driver of the vehicle could help Ivy complete her mission. That's it.And why is that? Well, because one of the things this film is is a love story, and a triumphant one at that. Ivy is in love with Lucius Hunt, and he is in love with her, and he needs medicine to survive two stab wounds given to him by another person who also loves Ivy, but with a different kind of love, as Lucius is about to explain before being stabbed. As anyone who has seen enough of Night's films knows, or should know, Love, with a capital ""L"", runs like a bright thread through all of them (at least the ones I've seen).  Romantic love, familial love (the deceased mother and living daughter in Sixth Sense: two words to remind you of one of the most moving scenes in movie history: ""Every day""), and deep, spiritual love (with and without the religious connotations). It bugs me to no end that in all the criticism I've read about Night's movies, so much is written about the damn ""twist"" and so little about the power of Love. What's especially touching about Ivy's love for Lucius is the way she has to draw him out, to make him speak his feelings. She is the great strength in the community, despite being blind, and the scene on the porch where she gets Lucius to confess his love for her is one of the most satisfying scenes I've ever watched in any film. Adding to the poignancy of this unspoken love is what is going on between Alice Hunt and Edward Walker (Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt). Lucius is speaking at one point to his mother, Alice Hunt, and mentions that Edward Walker is in love with her. She asks her son how he knows this, and he replies, ""Because he never touches you."" Again, a hair-raising line and a magnificent reflection on what it's like to harbor feelings of love for someone and not be able to tell them, a feeling with which I am painfully familiar.Early on there is a scene which stands in stark contrast to all of this: a scene where Ivy's sister confesses her love for Lucius Hunt boldly and without restraint. It's an early reminder that no matter how we try to insulate the people we love from being hurt, our efforts will very often - if not indeed always - go for nothing. The scene serves to remind people that the dangers of the world do not merely consist of evil people or evil creatures with dark intentions. Even Love can be dangerous, and in fact often is. Not only dangerous, but fatal. Enter one of the other pivotal characters, Noah Percy. Noah has some sort of mental deficiency and his behavior is often reckless and erratic. Ivy Walker is about the only one who seems to have a calming effect on Noah. She has power over him, and only later on do we realize that Noah has his own deep feelings of love for Ivy, feelings which become a dark and dangerous force equal to that of any evil mythical creature. Noah is the person who stabs Lucius, because Lucius threatens Noah's relationship with Ivy. It's not for nothing that Night has Noah dress up as one of the Covington Woods creatures in order to terrorize Ivy on her painstaking trek through the woods to the ""towns"" and frustrate her efforts to bring back medicine to save Lucius. He is showing how even innocence and love can be corrupted into something deadly and evil, and why we don't need to invent supernatural agents of terror, nor even supernatural agents of Love, for that matter, since the very real and natural Love that we are capable of as mere humans is sufficient to make us do virtuous and heroic things (as well as terrible things). This reminds me of a wonderful few lines spoken late in the film by Edward Walker, when he and the elders are beginning to realize that their utopian dreams may have been somewhat misgiven (I am paraphrasing, and may not have it exactly right): ""Love moves the world. The world bows before love, in awe.""To sum up, the Village is a film which offers many things to think about: is religion a good thing after all, can any utopian system actually work, is it a good idea to smother our loved ones in good intentions and keep them from living full, normal lives, and can love really save the day, when all is said and done? I believe it can. Thanks, Night, for this great and thought-provoking piece of work.",5,Look past the Bucket,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,7126,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'hereafter', 'referred', 'Night', 'got',

It must be the huge success of Signs that caused Hollywood to obligate MNS to come up a new movie ASAP, even if he hasn't written a great script. Ultimately, he managed to put in his usual twisted ending to the story that made it a total different kind of movie, and it's no longer a horror film!Big stars like Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt had insignificant roles in this movie, and it was totally wasted their time. Fresh off his Oscar Winning The Pianist, Adrian Brody found nothing more interesting than playing a small part(a retarded villager who dressed up as a monster to scare off any one from going into the wood, so that they will always stay in the village(the 1800's) away the the world(modern time). It's totally unworthy of his appearance in this film, because he doesn't speak, and his role requires him to deliver 10% of what he did in The Pianist.By the time the young blind heroine seeked her way to the outter world to obtain medicine, and encounter a police on the street, that's when the big twist comes in. I mean, even when monster(Brody) got killed in the woods, and it was already an indication that there was no monster, and the village is simply victims of surcumstances from the outside world, and that they chose to abandon it for good.Now the reason I was disappointed by this movie is 1: great cast for the poor characters. 2: poor plot made it looked like MNS got his feet on two boats at the same time.

860306,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00064LJVE,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Released in 2004, ""The Village"" is not a horror film; it's a romanticmystery. Not a 'mystery' in the sense of a murder mystery, but ratherall-around mysterious. It's a ""What if...?"" tale. The set-up presentsthe viewer with a slew of questions, which are all answered in thefinal act. The fun of the film is to see if you can figure out theanswers before they are revealed, but that's not the only reason toappreciate it.THE PLOT: A small village in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1897 is surroundedby foreboding woods that harbor mysterious creatures. The villagers arepretty much imprisoned in the hamlet. Something happens that prompts ayoung blind woman to risk a journey through the dangerous woods to findmedicines in another town.Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, stars as the innocent blindprotagonist while Joanquin Phoenix plays her strong-and-silent lovedone. Adrien Brody is effective as the detestable village idiot. Also onhand are Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt as the town elders, who knowmore about the situation than they let on.Director & writer M. Night Shyamalan portrays the locations with anaura of beauty and mystery. On top of this the score is fittinglyhaunting and beautiful. As such, the film is a feast for the eyes andears.There's one potent scene I must mention *** minor spoiler***: Near theend, the blind girl finally encounters a person from the outer towns.The contrast of the innocent, secluded blind girl and the outsider iswell captured. The outsider questions the mysterious girl butultimately discerns that she is genuine. This is an extraordinary scene-- ranking up there with the all-time best in cinema (much like themysterious Native American bar sequence in ""Wolfen"").Although the end-revelation in Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)"" wasoutstanding and arguably better than the the one in ""The Village"", Ipersonally prefer ""The Village"" overall. Bottom Line: If you have ataste for surreal mystery and rustic beauty, don't miss out on ""TheVillage."" It's a moving, one-of-a-kind picture.GRADE: B+ or A-***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT*** Do not read further if you haven't seen the film.There are two main mysteries: (1.) The nature of the creatures in thewoods, and (2.) the reality of the village itself. The truth about the""creatures"" may be discerned by some viewers before it is revealed,but, I gotta admit, my wife and I didn't figure it out (and she's goodat predicting story elements). As to the second mystery: There's no waya viewer could figure this enigma out as long as s/he accepts that thestory takes place in 1897, which both the film and the DVD jacketindicate. The only way you could unravel this puzzle is by consideringthe possibility that it does not take place in 1897. My Wife and Inever considered this possibility (after all, why would they lie?) andso were unable to discern the truth.Beyond all that, the film has a potent subtext. It's an allegoricalslam against socialism in general and, in particular, thathumanity-destroying socialist experiment known as Sweden. Its title isa riff on Hilary Clinton's socialist polemic ""It takes a village (toraise a child)"" Shyamalan shows the deadly consequence of entrustingthe care of our children to the socialist state. The movie opens withthe village's burial of a young child and begins the final act with thedeath of a product of village upbringing: a dim-witted, cravenmurderer.The movie focuses on the sad fate of the young adults who manage tosurvive their socialist upraising while retaining a remnant of hope fora better future. The pure-hearted and intelligent Ivy is ultimatelyseduced by power and welcomed into the inner-circle of village leaderswhere she will promote the utopian lie of peace within the communityand chaos outside, meanwhile continuing to bury the young and executethe useless.

860308,A2GR3LJ5HEYY1M,B00064LJVE,xyz,"[5, 7]","The photography and the performance of the new star, Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy, are absolutely great. The plot is mildly surprising but isn't particularly full of intrigues. Many, me included, might feel actually a bit cheated as the much awaited &quot;truth&quot; is finally revealed near the end. It's not because the story as a whole is bad; but it's because of the way the movie is marketed, of what we have come to expect from a Shyamalan movie, and most importantly of Shyamalan's misplaced focus in most of the movie.Give the same story to other directors, I am sure most likely most would prefer to treat it as essentially a drama and accordingly downplay the &quot;mysterious&quot; elements in the plot. It's actually a shame that what could have been a beautiful movie (the romance part of the story and the stunning visuals) was unfortunately turned into a mystery that cheats, and a horror flick that offers only empty scares.The gothic atmosphere created in the first two thirds of the movie is great. I felt totally engrossed, and couldn't wait to be led to find out the &quot;truth.&quot; But disappointingly, this first part of the movie promises far much more than what the story could subsequently deliver (in short, the movie cheats). Since nothing great, in terms of the revelation of the &quot;truth,&quot; is in store, and I cannot help wondering why the director seems totally happy to build up the audience's hope in the first place. To me, it almost feels like dishonest tease.&quot;Sixth Sense&quot; has most of its story independent of the movie's final surprise. So even if some smart audience thinks the twist is predictable and cheap, they would not feel cheated and question the integrity of the movie. The surprise is an extra treat and something that gives the movie an additional rich layer of texture. But &quot;The Village,&quot; &quot;Unbreakable&quot; and to smaller extent &quot;Signs&quot; all have their stories orbit around their respective &quot;twists.&quot; And unfortunately those twists are not all that satisfying, hence rendering those movies neither refreshing nor extremely likable.With his tremendous craftsmanship in creating atmosphere and the movie's great cast, I believe &quot;The Village&quot; would have been a much better piece should Shyamalan have not sacrificed the focus on the dramatic elements in favor of the disappointingly empty mystery.
