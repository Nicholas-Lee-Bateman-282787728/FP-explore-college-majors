The story of the wild tobacco plant that actually recruited less harmful pollinators by changing its blooming time of day is mind blowing.  As a gardener/organic grower it also gave me great insight into the basic good gardening practices my mother taught me and that I always follow on cultivation, soil conditioning and tender care with the roots of plants in transplanting.  It also makes explicit what is there to see in the documentary Microcosmos about the relationship between plants and pollinators as well as affirming what Lynn McTaggert's experiments showed about sentience & intention in plants in her books ""Living in the Field"" and ""the Intention Experiment"".
