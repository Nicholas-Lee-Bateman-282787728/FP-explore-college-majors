Then when the second season hit store shelves on February 14th of 2012 (a year and EIGHT months later) a friend of mine bought it and I watched his. I got to thinking ""Well, well, well. A little bit of an improvement here"". So I went ahead and bought seasons 1 & 2 (wouldn't make since to skip the first season all together). Then a WHOLE year past and that's when the third season finally came out. I bought mine, took it home, popped it in and laughed till I cried. Great season. Urkel really started cracking me up in that one. Now I am noticing something really odd about the release dates for these seasons. Think about the newer TV show's that's still in production today like ""Two and a half men"", ""The Big bang theory"", Criminal Minds"", etc. Other than the time frame from the first to the second season which was ridiculously long, i'm noticing that the time frame between season releases are the same time frame as the other aforementioned shows listed above. This is a 90's show. It has great family values. Values that's too hard to find now days and that's a sad fact. And with a character like Urkel running around you can't help but laugh on top of true emotional moments. This show is the definition of ""Life values"". For those of you who are true fans and I know ya'll are out there please, if you can, please help Warner Bros. squeeze out the rest of the seasons starting with the fourth season of course.

Now to the point of my review - the limited, replacement discs. What I also don't understand is why the studio is releasing these unedited episodes, the ones we customers asked for, for only a limited time. Limited is the key word here. We should not, and I repeat, should not have to suffer for a mistake that Warner Bros. studios made, which is exactly what seems to be the case. I'm not saying we actually are suffering, but it certainly feels like it, It's not the consumer's fault Warner Bros. didn't provide the uncut episodes the first time around. Now I'm sure the studio probably has a very good reason for this (and I hope they do), but I still feel that I need to write this. While it's good that they're also providing them for the online consumers, why can't they also have these new discs in the packaging (for online purchase as well)  for the people who didn't by the set the first time around? This seems to be another sign that we're suffering for their mistake.
