969551,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B000E6ES9O,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[0, 0]","As a hard-core ""Family Guy"" fan/purist, I was biased toward the former for a somewhat long time, but it seemed to lose some of its edge after a while. I haven't seen it in quite some time, but I hear the recent shows aren't as good as it used to be; I'll have to see for myself to know for sure. But again, it comes down to personal taste.On to ""American Dad! (Volume One)."" On the earlier shows, it seemed to still be  finding its way, but it still set the stage for an extremely funny show. After reading several unfavorable reviews, I realized that there is a part of MacFarlane's fan base which insists on ""Family Guy"" only. It seems the purists were seeing it as moving in on Peter Griffin's territory; I know, because that's how I felt. But where there is some thematic overlapping, this is it's own show.When a TV show's title and premise focuses on one person, there is usually someone else who tends to steal the limelight: re ""Frasier"" had his brother Niles, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" had Ray's brother Robert, ""Mork And Mindy"" had Exador (spelling?), ""Married With Children,"" though it was about Al Bundy, the neighbor Marcy Rhodes (later Darcy) often stole the show, especially in the earlier shows, when her dark side would come out. ""My Name Is Earl's"" screentime is easily dominated by Jamie Pressley as Earl's ex-wife Joy Turner. But in ""American Dad!"" Stan Smith is so over-the-top in every area, MacFarlane himself says it's physically demanding to even voice him. Just watch him, in every episode, he goes the distance to achieve his ends, whatever the personal cost. The show's creators are largely liberal, and the show lampoons the conservative point-of-view, and provides lots of laughs for both sides of the aisle. Stan, a fundamentalist Christian Republican who works for the C.I.A., is a fearless crusader for the America of old, but is privvy to all the latest gadgets and technology completely alien to his beloved old homeland. He is relentless, and often clueless in terms of how his actions affect the people around him; you could even say he's insane. But he is fiercely protective of his family, even his ultra-leftist daughter Hayley, with whom he disagrees about literally everything. He obviously has a heart, because he even harbors a space alien (Roger, modeled after the late Paul Lynde) who is being actively hunted by his employer, the C.I.A. His pet goldfish is actually a German named Klaus, whose brain has been transplanted into the fish. Pure science fiction, but it is an animated TV show. His wife, Francine, a one-time rock-and-roll groupie from the 1980's, is now trying to be a good wife and mother, allowing Stan to get away with most of his escapades. And the son, Steve, is a nerdy, horny teenage boy whose quest in life is to get ""some boob."" It's a fractured family unit, but a unit nonetheless.The four star rating: Like ""Family Guy,"" this series has been released as volumes instead of seasons, hence the customer must buy multiple season-priced volumes to aquire a single season. It's a compromise, but one worth taking, because this really is a hilarious show.",4,"Four stars, I'll explain the loss of a star in time",1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,3120,"['hard-core', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fan/purist', 'was', 'biased', 'former', 'somewhat', 'long', 'time', 'seemed', 'lose', 'edge', 'while', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'hear', 'recent', 'shows', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'used', 'be', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'know', 'sure', 'again', 'down', 'personal', 'taste.On', 'American', 'Dad', 'Volume', 'One', 'earlier', 'shows', 'seemed', 'still', 'be', 'finding', 'way', 'still', 'set', 'stage', 'extremely', 'funny', 'show', 'reading', 'several', 'unfavorable', 'reviews', 'realized', 'part', 'MacFarlane', 'fan', 'base', 'Family', 'Guy', 'only', 'purists', 'were', 'seeing', 'moving', 'Peter', 'Griffin', 'territory', 'know', 'how', 'felt', 'where', 'thematic', 'overlapping', 'own', 'show.When', 'TV', 'show', 'title', 'premise', 'focuses', 'one', 'person', 'usually', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'steal', 'limelight', 're', 'Frasier', 'had', 'brother', 'Niles', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'had', 'Ray', 'brother', 'Robert', 'Mork', 'Mindy', 'had', 'Exador', 'spelling', 'Married', 'Children', 'was', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'neighbor', 'Marcy', 'Rhodes', 'later', 'Darcy', 'often', 'stole', 'show', 'especially', 'earlier', 'shows', 'when', 'dark', 'side', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'Name', 'Earl', 'screentime', 'easily', 'dominated', 'Jamie', 'Pressley', 'Earl', 'ex-wife', 'Joy', 'Turner', 'American', 'Dad', 'Stan', 'Smith', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'area', 'MacFarlane', 'physically', 'demanding', 'even', 'voice', 'Just', 'watch', 'episode', 'distance', 'achieve', 'ends', 'whatever', 'personal', 'cost', 'show', 'creators', 'are', 'largely', 'liberal', 'show', 'conservative', 'point-of-view', 'lots', 'laughs', 'sides', 'aisle', 'Stan', 'fundamentalist', 'Christian', 'Republican', 'who', 'C.I.A.', 'fearless', 'crusader', 'America', 'old', 'privvy', 'latest', 'gadgets', 'technology', 'completely', 'alien', 'beloved', 'old', 'homeland', 'relentless', 'often', 'clueless', 'terms', 'how', 'actions', 'affect', 'people', 'could', 'even', 'say', 'insane', 'fiercely', 'protective', 'family', 'even', 'ultra-leftist', 'daughter', 'Hayley', 'whom', 'literally', 'everything', 'obviously', 'heart', 'even', 'space', 'alien', 'Roger', 'modeled', 'late', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'who', 'being', 'actively', 'hunted', 'employer', 'C.I.A', 'pet', 'goldfish', 'actually', 'German', 'named', 'Klaus', 'brain', 'been', 'transplanted', 'fish', 'Pure', 'science', 'fiction', 'animated', 'TV', 'show', 'wife', 'Francine', 'one-time', 'rock-and-roll', 'groupie', '1980', 'now', 'trying', 'be', 'good', 'wife', 'mother', 'allowing', 'Stan', 'get', 'away', 'most', 'escapades', 'son', 'Steve', 'nerdy', 'horny', 'teenage', 'boy', 'quest', 'life', 'get', 'boob', 'fractured', 'family', 'unit', 'unit', 'nonetheless.The', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'Family', 'Guy', 'series', 'been', 'released', 'volumes', 'instead', 'seasons', 'hence', 'customer', 'must', 'buy', 'multiple', 'season-priced', 'volumes', 'aquire', 'single', 'season', 'compromise', 'one', 'worth', 'taking', 'really', 'hilarious', 'show']",N/A

969556,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B000E6ES9O,Charlie Brooks,"[1, 1]","American Dad debuted to mixed reviews at first, but has picked up steam since and never turned back. The show begins as what is essentially Family Guy with new characters. The pilot episode has everything from a stupid father figure to nonsensical cutaways. But then the show found its own identity and took off running, to the point where it now far exceeds its coutnerpart Family Guy in terms of humor and quality.American Dad is another in a long line of sitcoms with a stupid, ignorant dad and his adventures with the family. The twist here is that Stan Smith is a CIA agent and extreme supporter of the then-current conservative Bush government. It's notable, though, that while Stan comes across as stupid, he's not a jerk. It's refreshing to see that Seth McFarlane, who couldn't keep his political views out of Family Guy, takes a fairly balanced view here. Stan is offset by his extremely liberal daughter Haley, and each is wrong about as many times as they're right - very much like political extremists in real life. Most importantly, there is still a caring core to the family, so Stan becomes a guy that you like. Unlike Peter Griffin or Homer Simpson, whose stupidity has risen to epic levels in later years of their respective shows, Stan Smith remains a guy with a ten-cent head but a million-dollar heart.American Dad is at its best when it keeps that last point in mind, channeling Archie Bunker instead of Peter Griffin. It takes the show a few episodes to find its footing, but once it does you'll see that Stan and his family, including surrogate additions such as an alcoholic alien and a talking fish, present a perfect balance of comedy. While future DVD sets eclipse the quality here, it's worth checking this set out because of the evolution you get to see in the show. Here you'll be able to watch American Dad go from poor cousin to comic gold.",4,Evolution of a great show,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,1873,"['American', 'Dad', 'debuted', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'first', 'picked', 'up', 'steam', 'never', 'turned', 'back', 'show', 'what', 'essentially', 'Family', 'Guy', 'new', 'characters', 'pilot', 'episode', 'everything', 'stupid', 'father', 'figure', 'nonsensical', 'cutaways', 'then', 'show', 'found', 'own', 'identity', 'took', 'off', 'running', 'point', 'where', 'now', 'far', 'coutnerpart', 'Family', 'Guy', 'terms', 'humor', 'quality.American', 'Dad', 'long', 'line', 'sitcoms', 'stupid', 'ignorant', 'dad', 'adventures', 'family', 'twist', 'here', 'Stan', 'Smith', 'CIA', 'agent', 'extreme', 'supporter', 'then-current', 'conservative', 'Bush', 'government', 'notable', 'though', 'Stan', 'stupid', 'not', 'jerk', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'political', 'views', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fairly', 'balanced', 'view', 'here', 'Stan', 'offset', 'extremely', 'liberal', 'daughter', 'Haley', 'wrong', 'as', 'many', 'times', ""'re"", 'right', 'very', 'much', 'political', 'extremists', 'real', 'life', 'Most', 'importantly', 'still', 'caring', 'core', 'family', 'so', 'Stan', 'guy', 'like', 'Peter', 'Griffin', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'stupidity', 'risen', 'epic', 'levels', 'later', 'years', 'respective', 'shows', 'Stan', 'Smith', 'guy', 'ten-cent', 'head', 'million-dollar', 'heart.American', 'Dad', 'best', 'when', 'last', 'point', 'mind', 'channeling', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'instead', 'Peter', 'Griffin', 'show', 'few', 'episodes', 'find', 'footing', 'once', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Stan', 'family', 'including', 'surrogate', 'additions', 'such', 'alcoholic', 'alien', 'talking', 'fish', 'present', 'perfect', 'balance', 'comedy', 'future', 'DVD', 'sets', 'eclipse', 'quality', 'here', 'worth', 'checking', 'set', 'out', 'evolution', 'get', 'see', 'show', 'Here', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'American', 'Dad', 'go', 'poor', 'cousin', 'comic', 'gold']",N/A

This is the beginning of American Dad not whatever episodes are now playing on cartoon network or FOX so I'm rating the first episodes of this series. Yes at this moment the new episodes are very funny but the ones in the beginning aren't that great. Some say you have to watch a movie or show a few times before you can form your opinion about it but we already know the mind of Seth Macfarlane.American Dad is Ok and it's no Family guy. Come on everybody loves family guy so why wouldn't we compare American Dad to it and in the match up American Dad lost by a lot. Now even if I weren't comparing this to Family Guy and as fans of the series you can't lie and say you don't think to yourself while watching these opening episodes that you hope this show is as good as the Family Guy.

969568,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B000E6ES9O,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Funny and surreal, full of non-stop non sequiturs, bad puns and absurdity. This animated satire of a hyperright-wing moron father who works for the CIA, and his very bizarre family; which includes a pet goldfish withthe brain of German Olympic athlete and a fey alien, uses a scatter-shot approach to humor. A lot of the jokesdon't work, but a lot do, and some of those are laugh-out-loud funny.Gleefully jumping all over the concept of good taste, it can often be sophomoric, but sophomoric can still bevery amusing. Sometimes it's the very pushing the bounds of bad taste that, as with 'South Park' is what makesit as shockingly funny as it is, and gives it a bit of an edge as well (although it can't compete with South Park's moresophisticated political and topical humor).

Klaus the fish must have initially seemed like a good idea but then the writers struggle to use him - although they actually succeed better as the series progresses.Unlike Family Guy, the two children (let's ignore the brilliant Stewie) in American Dad are well thought-out and have a real role in the episodes.Francine is as well written as Lois Griffin and Roger the alien is a great creation.Father Stan is also well written but isn't allowed to dominate the show Peter Griffin-style and suppoting characters such as Bullock (take a bow Patrick Stewart!) show potential for later series - something I'm sure will happen.",4,Watch out Peter Griffin!,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1461,"['saw', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'American', 'Dad', 'was', 'being', 'brought', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'Family', 'Guy', 'season', '4.Family', 'Guy', 'getting', 'recommissioned', 'was', 'great', 'news', ""'interloper"", 'looked', 'pale', 'immitation.As', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'far', 'better', 'season', '4', 'Family', 'Guy', 'sadly', 'showing', 'major', 'fatigue.Not', 'relying', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', '_____', 'gags', 'Family', 'Guy', 'now', 'just', 'string', 'American', 'Dad', 'much', 'more', 'accessable', 'almost', 'conventional', 'structure', 'conventional', 'can', 'be', 'alien', 'talking', 'German', 'goldfish', '.Ignoring', 'biting', 'politics', 'show', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'slightly', 'less', 'crude', 'Family', 'Guy', 'become', 'Family', 'Guy', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'under-used', 'Klaus', 'fish', 'must', 'have', 'initially', 'seemed', 'good', 'idea', 'then', 'writers', 'struggle', 'use', 'actually', 'succeed', 'better', 'series', 'Family', 'Guy', 'two', 'children', 'let', 'ignore', 'brilliant', 'Stewie', 'American', 'Dad', 'are', 'well', 'thought-out', 'have', 'real', 'role', 'episodes.Francine', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'Lois', 'Griffin', 'Roger', 'alien', 'great', 'creation.Father', 'Stan', 'also', 'well', 'written', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'dominate', 'show', 'Peter', 'Griffin-style', 'suppoting', 'characters', 'such', 'Bullock', 'take', 'bow', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'show', 'potential', 'later', 'series', 'something', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'happen']",N/A

969578,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000E6ES9O,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[2, 3]","I've been a reluctant fan of American Dad.  I figured it was Family Guy's less funny younger cousin and often did not stay up late enough to watch the original airing of the episodes.  I thought that, besides Stan and Roger, the characters were rather bland: Hayley the sexually promiscuous liberal, Francine the independent wife who didn't have the same spunk as Lois Griffin, and Steve, the geeky son, who didn't seem to fit in the family (he doesn't look a thing like his parents).  Then there is Klaus, the goldfish with an East German Olympian's brain who is fixated on Francine and doesn't have the storyline importance of Brian.  Those times I stayed up to watch the show, though, I found it very funny with witty political humor and numerous sexual innuendos which are even funnier when Stan has no clue what he is saying.  Now that the DVD collections are more affordable, I've gotten the three volumes released so far and have enjoyed watching them, although they do not have the same re-watch ability of Family Guy and South Park.Disc 1:""Pilot""--Stan fixes the student body president election for his son to help him attract the lead cheerleader.  Meanwhile, Roger is put on a diet and writes Hayley's paper in exchange for junk food.""Stan Knows Best""--Fed up with her father's dictatorship, Hayley leaves home to live in her boyfriend's van and becomes a stripper. Stan--""Do I have to smell like BO and hump a redwood just to get through to her?""  In his constant quest to get lucky, Steve poses Roger as his burn victim sister to get sympathy from a girl.""Threat Levels""--Francine decides to be a real estate agent and Stan is jealous that she is making more money.  He is even angrier when she sells the neighboring house to the news anchormen couple Greg and Terry of whom he disapproves because they are...uh...reporters.""Francine's Flashback""--Stan forgets his wedding anniversary again and, to avoid the consequences, he has his wife's memory erased.  The wrong turn of the dial, however, causes her memory to go back to 1985.  Hayley finds out her mom was once cool and Stan tries to jog her memory by recreating the moment they fell in love.  Roger makes a big time racist statement in this one.Disc 2:""Roger Codger""--Stan thinks he has no sissy feelings, especially not for his resident moocher alien, Roger.  When he thinks Roger died, he unceremoniously chucks his body in a dumpster much to the chagrin of his family who have grown fond of the Paul Lynde wannabe, especially Steve.  When Roger turns up alive and is pursued by the CIA, the alien is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect his new earthling family and tear-like substance wells up in Stan's eyes after all.  The back story of how Roger and Stan met is in this episode.""Homeland Insecurity""--Francine organizes a neighborhood party and Stan is paranoid about the Iranian-American couple on their block.  Meanwhile, Roger tries to find out his special power.  Weird ending that has nothing to do with the story (is this movie reference or something?).""Deacon Stan, Jesus Man""--Stan is in constant competition with his hot shot neighbor, Chuck White.  When they both run for deacon, Stan recruits the assistance of Karl Rove and crowd-pleasing potato salad made with Roger's lactating milky mucus from his mammary glands (uh,..eeewwww).  The alien looks hilarious fattened up in a milking harness.  Oh, and Roger gets Steve pregnant (yes, it's that kind of episode).""Bullocks to Stan""--Stan's daughter Hayley  sleeps with his Yul Brynner-looking boss Bullock, but he can't react because he is up for promotion.  Hayley's promiscuity is a little much here.Disc 3:""A Smith in the Hand""--Steve is about to take sexual education, so Stan takes over and teaches his son the evils of playing ""a solo on the devil's clarinet.""  An accident down there requires Stan to apply ointment directly to the affected area and, as Stan says, it's ""like God has kissed me with a mouthful of Scotch.""  Steve is sickeningly sweet in this one.  I was waiting for him to start saying ""Gee, that's swell.""""All About Steve""--Stan ditches his son because he is a not cool but then is able to use Steve's geekiness to solve the case of a mysterious cyberterrorist.""Con Heir""--Stan has been lying about who his father is and his family resents it--well, except Roger who is taken in by the heroic new grandpa Smith.  Steve makes out with an, uh, older woman.""Stan of Arabia""--Two-parter.  Stan is transferred to Saudi Arabia.  While he appreciates Saudi culture so much he renounces his family's American citizenship, his independent wife and daughter, overzealous son, and alcoholic alien have trouble adjusting.  The songs are a bit much, but I do like the song that makes fun of the 1950s. Roger and the Arab with the ""beast with the two humps"" is very funny.  The second part of this episode also contains another reference to my alma mater, Chico State.Extras--Lots of extras are included in this collection, including commentaries on most of the episodes, ""All in the Family"" featurette on the creation of American Dad, animatics and, my favorite, 42 deleted scenes.",4,"""Oh, what fresh Hell is this?""---Roger",1232323200,"01 19,

969579,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000E6ES9O,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 19]","Considering it's from Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, American Dad is pretty much what you'd expect: irreverant, animated humor revolving around a dysfunctional family.  However, American Dad doesn't have the same punch that Family Guy has always had, and a majority of the episodes are hit and miss.  The series revolves around Republican CIA man Stan Smith, his hot wife, dorky son, new wave hippie daughter, gay alien friend Roger (yes, you read that right), and a talking goldfish that has the brain of a crazy German.  It sounds like buckets of laughs, but American Dad is actually more of a satire than anything else, and it's not bad, but if you're expecting the same kind of comedic gems that Family Guy is full of, you'll be disappointed.

969582,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000E6ES9O,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[7, 8]","Not since the days of Caroll O' Connor's `Archie Bunker' has a character so expertly satirized current events---all while making all audiences feel like he promoted their side of things.When it looked like the show was about to be cancelled the creators of `Family Guy' came up with another series. Critiquing `post 9-11' America, `American Dad!' updates `All in the Family's' formula through a cartoon format. The animation style and some of the voices are similar to 'Family Guy', but this series has much more in common with those inherently political sitcoms of the 1970's.CIA Agent Stan Smith wants to protect his country-but he alsowants to maintain his own little sheltered world view. Despite his job Stan ultimately has a very limited grasp of international affairs. However he does know that he loves his family and is only trying to do what he thinks is best for them---by any means necessary!In the pilot episode, Stan attempts to get his son Steve a dog so he will then be popular with the ladies-never mind the fact that this particular dog had been selected only because it was alive during the Reagan administration-making the poor thing older than dirt in people years! After it is accidentally killed during a `home invasion' false alarm, he again tries to help his son out by rigging the school elections so Steve is elected the school president!""Threat Levels"" exposes the realities of public sector vs. private sector pay. When the formerly homemaking Francine enters the real-estate business and then quickly becomes a success Stan feels emasculated. He loves his wife, but her new career cuts away at his fantasy of the `male-breadwinner head of household' myth he had constructed and maintained for himself.  Even having her boss arrested and the agency she worked with shut down does not resolve this  situation-Francine simply becomes an independent agent! Hayley sees an opportunity of her own using one of the homes which mom is trying to sell as a homeless shelter. Somehow, dad ultimately muscles little brother away from the cockfighting business he had established at that same shelter and takes over it himself. The episode wryly explored anxieties being felt over shifting economic realities and gender.13 episodes make up the first half of this 2005-2006season release.  Episodes you and your own `family' will love include ""Bullocks to Stan"" because he learns that his boss is sleeping with his ultra-liberal daughter Haley. Because Stan and Haley were close when she was younger but drifted apart because of their divergent political views, he wants to recreate that earlier relationship. Stan has difficulty processing that his daughter is both grownup and sleeping with the boss (voiced by none other than Patrick Stewart).Another good episode mixing sex and politics together for laughs is ""A Smith in the Hand"". Concerned that Steve is receiving sex education at school, Stan volunteers to give his own demonstration to that class. During that demonstration, Stan attacks masturbation and sex as inherently evil.  Resultant crotch injuries then require Stan to apply ointment to his own crotch, and he discovers masturbation for the first time. Steve then discovers what dad is now hooked on and they hypocritically go around promote the idea on television that masturbation is bad all while doing it themselves. Finally, Francine steps in and tells them that she has had enough and sexual feelings are perfectly normal.Francine usually keeps her own opinions to herself, but she really is a closet liberal underneath it all.This is apparent when Stan attempts to erase her mind so she will not remember that he forgot their anniversary or that it is their anniversary (""Francine's Flashback""). Instead of only taking off 20 hours however, the CIA scientist erases 20 years and she is now unable to remember anything about her current life-including that she is married to Stan himself. Despite what he had CIA colleagues do, Stan becomes panicked by this development-he had not wanted things to go this far and fears loosing Francine forever. Her memory is miraculously recovered at a concert though and another crisis is temporarily averted in the Smith household.Francine's quick thinking saves the day when Stan panics about the Iranian new neighbors (""Homeland Insecurity""). Suspecting that they are `terrorists', Stan then decides they will be detained in his home-attempting to publicly justify this through the Patriot Act. Contrasting, Francine takes the more sophisticated approach-she sells the whole thing as a neighborhood block party which just happens to have a ""Terrorist Detention Camp"" theme. She is the one who really has the people skills needed to conduct covert operation!I'm honestly not that crazy about the ending two-parter ""Stan of Arabia"", where the Smith family temporarily lives in Saudi Arabia. Okay yes, the CIA does travel internationally but the series creators themselves obviously did not have knowledge of the Middle East before writing these episodes. `American Dad' usually works (and very well) because they could show Stan being a well-intentioned dofus without complete knowledge of the America which everybody else around him does know about. This plot device doesn't work as well when the writers themselves lack in knowledge of the same thing they attempt to critique.Extras include Commentary on 12 episodes by Creators & Producers Mike Barker, Matt Weitzman, Seth MacFarlane and others, a featurette called ""All in the Family: Creating American Dad, a "" featurette called  ""Secrets of the Glass Booth: Behind the Voices of American
