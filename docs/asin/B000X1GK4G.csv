1112846,A3Q5VYUN1JN4VV,B000X1GK4G,"Daniel J. Seitler ""shinybear""","[0, 0]",I just finished this dream-like 1947 film noir. It's a strangely compelling oddity and it ruined the Hollywood career of Jean Renoir who was released from his contract with RKO over this. Apparently the studio didn't like his finished film and mutilated the hell out of it. It's still watchable and features a knock out performance by Joan Bennett. Coast guard officer Robert Ryan suffers from PTSD over a ship wreck. His nightmare sequences are really great. He's engaged to be married to a normal blonde good girl but he becomes obsessed with mysterious dark haired Joan Bennett who's always hanging around a ship wreck by the sea. Joan is married to Charles Bickford- an emotional blind painter whose optic nerve she cut with broken glass one wild drunken night. From here on the movie is odd but interesting. Ryan becomes convinced that Bickford can really see (he can't) and leads him off a cliff. The blind artist survives. The ending is surprising and I won't give it away but this is not the usual noir. Bennett seems like a femme fatale but really isn't. Her relationship with the blind artist is drunken and twisted but also sort of real and touching. I also liked that Ryan tells off his provincial blonde love interest. Was this really all about recovery from PSTD? We'll probably never know.

1112848,AY4D0V80K2EK,B000X1GK4G,"Keisuke Kawasaki ""kumasan""","[6, 6]","THE WOMAN ON THE BEACH is generally regarded as one of the great film master Jean Renoir's lesser works. Because it is somewhat obscrure in development of the story line and the characters. Renoir tried to say something worthwile but at first glance, it might be hard for the viewers to receive clear message from the film.However, significance of this film lies on that particular difficulty. The cinema was meant to be complex and puzzling. Due to its sophisticated complexity, THE WOMAN ON THE BEACH quite frequently makes us think and feel about our real self. Three main characters are all obsessed with fear one way or another, but in the same time, they are trying to get out from their obssession and struggle to seek truth of themselves.You may wonder how three main characters managed to accomplish this serious task within little running time as 71 minutes, but by the end, they managed to overcome their problems rather convincingly. Thanks to strong characterizations by three leads(Joan Bennett, Robert Ryan, and Charles Bickford) and sensible direction from Jean Renoir.I would rank THE WOMAN ON THE BEACH as the Renoir's hidden masterpiece. It is quite intelligent, powerful, experimental, and totally memorable.",5,Obsecure? Maybe.

1112849,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000X1GK4G,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","Woman on the Beach (Jean Renoir, 1947)Trite, predictable noir-esque romance, not at all the kind of thing one would expect from a top-notch director like Renoir. Simple plot: military man (Robert Ryan) is suffering from what we would now call Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Gets scared. Wants to marry his girlfriend (Nan Leslie) immediately. But then meets seductive, sexy married chick (Joan Bennett) with blind ex-painter husband (Charles Bickford). Becomes obsessed with sexy chick (at which point girlfriend becomes almost a cameo in the film, rather than the main character she's set up to be; this is what I mean when I say you don't expect this level of filmmaking in a Renoir movie). Confrontation with husband. Repeat as necessary. You know the drill. I wonder if Renoir just needed the money?

1112850,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000X1GK4G,Trevor Willsmer,"[9, 10]","The Woman On the Beach isn't top drawer Jean Renoir, but his near-noir psychodrama has much to recommend it despite the inevitable tinkering at the hands of RKO. There's some striking imagery and design (not least the shipwreck on the beach where the illicit lovers meet) and Robert Ryan gives a strong performance as the vulnerable lead despite having the odd line of inane on the nose dialogue like ""Let's face it, I'm not well!"" - but then, this IS a character haunted by nightmares of romantic liaisons at the bottom of the sea amid the skeletons of his drowned shipmates. And that's before he gets reluctantly drawn into Joan Bennett and her blind artist husband Charles Bickford's marital problems. Not that Ryan, falling for Bennett despite the fact that her vocal delivery often turns into a deadening drone, believes Bickford's blind, and it's not long before trying to prove it by taking him  for a walk along the edge of a cliff...It's hard not to see this as a major influence on Roman Polanski's Bitter Moon, so perverse is the couple's relationship of mutual dependency and loathing, although at heart it's about the need to burn the ghosts of the past, whether it be driftwood from a sunken ship or something more personally damaging. The ending is either brilliant or disappointing, and you probably still won't know which after seeing the film.",3,Not Renoir at his best but definitely ahead of its time,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,1361,"['Woman', 'Beach', ""n't"", 'top', 'drawer', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'near-noir', 'psychodrama', 'much', 'recommend', 'inevitable', 'tinkering', 'hands', 'RKO', 'striking', 'imagery', 'design', 'not', 'least', 'shipwreck', 'beach', 'where', 'illicit', 'lovers', 'meet', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'strong', 'performance', 'vulnerable', 'lead', 'having', 'odd', 'line', 'inane', 'nose', 'dialogue', 'Let', 'face', ""'m"", 'not', 'well', 'then', 'character', 'haunted', 'nightmares', 'romantic', 'liaisons', 'bottom', 'sea', 'skeletons', 'drowned', 'shipmates', 'reluctantly', 'drawn', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'blind', 'artist', 'husband', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'marital', 'problems', 'Not', 'Ryan', 'falling', 'Bennett', 'fact', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'often', 'deadening', 'drone', 'Bickford', 'blind', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'trying', 'prove', 'taking', 'walk', 'edge', 'cliff', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'major', 'influence', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Bitter', 'Moon', 'so', 'perverse', 'couple', 'relationship', 'mutual', 'dependency', 'loathing', 'heart', 'need', 'burn', 'ghosts', 'past', 'be', 'driftwood', 'sunken', 'ship', 'something', 'more', 'personally', 'damaging', 'ending', 'brilliant', 'disappointing', 'probably', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'seeing', 'film']",The Woman on the Beach [Region 2]
