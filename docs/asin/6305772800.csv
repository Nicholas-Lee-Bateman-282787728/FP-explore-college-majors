477364,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6305772800,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[11, 11]","This is an educational film which also has hypnotically beautiful visuals and a lovely score put together by composer Steve Wood that includes a lot of music and vocals by Sting, as well as having Meryl Streep give us a stream of information in her well-spoken narration.It documents the sea and its creatures, and also how people connect with it, either for pleasure, commerce, or survival. We get to see the Coast Guard boat traveling through 15 foot waves, some outstanding surfing footage, and how the inhabitants of the West Pacific island of Palau interact and respect the water that surrounds them.One one level one can use this film to learn some facts about the ocean, and on another, one can sit back and enjoy the wonderful cinematography. Fascinating parts include the jellyfish in Palau, the Monterrey Bay Aquarium Research Institute showing us a Siphonophore, which is about half the size of a football field, and visible through their underwater probe, and of course, the whales !The film is 40 minutes long, and the video contains a 27 minute &quot;Making of&quot; documentary, which has interviews with Producer/Director Greg MacGillivray, among others, like photographer Howard Hall describing the difficulty of filming in water.I found this documentary particularly interesting, and think it deserves 5 stars, because it gave me knowledge I did not have before, and the filmmakers made some painstaking efforts to bring it to us, like the timelapse photography of the tides. It was nominated for a 1995 Best Documentary Short Subject Academy Award, and seeing it is definitely time well spent.",5,&quot;the cradle of life&quot;,1056672000,"06 27, 2003",2003,1612,"['educational', 'film', 'also', 'hypnotically', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'lovely', 'score', 'put', 'together', 'composer', 'Steve', 'Wood', 'lot', 'music', 'vocals', 'Sting', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'give', 'stream', 'information', 'well-spoken', 'narration.It', 'documents', 'sea', 'creatures', 'also', 'how', 'people', 'connect', 'either', 'pleasure', 'commerce', 'survival', 'get', 'see', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'boat', 'traveling', '15', 'foot', 'waves', 'outstanding', 'surfing', 'footage', 'how', 'inhabitants', 'West', 'Pacific', 'island', 'Palau', 'interact', 'respect', 'water', 'them.One', 'one', 'level', 'one', 'can', 'use', 'film', 'learn', 'facts', 'ocean', 'one', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'Fascinating', 'parts', 'include', 'jellyfish', 'Palau', 'Monterrey', 'Bay', 'Aquarium', 'Research', 'Institute', 'showing', 'Siphonophore', 'size', 'football', 'field', 'visible', 'underwater', 'probe', 'course', 'whales', 'film', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'video', '27', 'minute', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'Producer/Director', 'Greg', 'MacGillivray', 'others', 'photographer', 'Howard', 'Hall', 'describing', 'difficulty', 'filming', 'water.I', 'found', 'documentary', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'think', '5', 'stars', 'gave', 'knowledge', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'painstaking', 'efforts', 'bring', 'timelapse', 'photography', 'tides', 'was', 'nominated', '1995', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Short', 'Subject', 'Academy', 'Award', 'seeing', 'definitely', 'time', 'well', 'spent']",The Living Sea

477371,AY12DBB0U420B,6305772800,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Living Sea,"" a film originally created for showing in IMAX theaters.This version was set in ""large format"" suitable for viewing on widescreen television sets. The film production is excellent, as is the sound, but if you ever get the chance view it in an IMAX Theater, of course. The movie is shot at a wide variety of places all over the world using the special and bulky IMAX camera. The photography in this film, especially the underwater photography, is just incredible. The kelp forests and coral reefs, among other things, are indescribably beautiful. You just have to see it. I'm a geology professor and I have watched a lot of underwater films, but I've never seen anything else that would come close to this. If I had a gripe (very minor), I regret that more footage wasn't devoted to the underwater photography and less was devoted to the surface human activities such as surfing and boating, but I can see their reasons for doing it and my complaining isn't very vocal.One of the cameramen is a specialist in surfing photography, and he's quite exceptionally good. I would be inclined to give him the chance to produce an IMAX surfing film and I'm sure it would be second to none. I just didn't particularly like the mixture of scientific and recreational subjects. And speaking of mixing subjects, the film has a somewhat preachy attitude about saving the sea. Well, I suppose that's necessary too. Actually, there's just too much subject material to cover and the movie seems much too short.If you watch the film, you will also want to watch ""The Making of The Living Sea,"" the explanation that follows and that is actually longer than the film. Personally, I found it to be just as interesting as the film and it's another chance to see more of that marvelous underwater photography and how they shoot it.Gary Peterson",5,Filming And Sound Excellent.

I was totally blown away by the incredible sound and photography.

My fave part was the  discovery of the new underwater fish and the fish that had, what looked  like, thousands of little lights flashing on and off.A scene with a boat  fighting waves and crashing back down onto the sea was better than anything  in The Perfect Storm.
