333198,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,6302767741,A Customer,"[0, 1]","Upon watching this movie, I was reminded of The Big Chill.  After the movie, I saw that the DVD blurb compared it to The Big Chill.  Wow, I feel intelligent now.Seriously, the beginning was so god-awful bad that it turned me against the movie.  But I'm so glad I kept watching.  At the end, when they referred back to the beginning to complete the cycle, the formula was complete.  For me, that part didn't work and was downright painful in its stupidity.  But everything in between was brilliant.  How strange.Look at the cast, and you will expect great acting.  You'll get it.  I already knew Rita Rudner as a perceptive and funny stand-up comic.  As you would expect, that does translate to her writing.  It turns out she can act, too.Actually, I see 3.5 or 3.75 stars here.  But some of the other reviewers were a bit too complimentary, so I thought I'd rein them in a bit.  It's a character-driven, perceptive gem of a film, and I'll be generous and assume that the ""sexpot"" character was meant to be every bit annoying as she is.  I've forgotten her name, or to care.  It's a fine film indeed.",3,The Big Thrill?,1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,1099,"['watching', 'movie', 'was', 'reminded', 'Big', 'Chill', 'movie', 'saw', 'DVD', 'blurb', 'compared', 'Big', 'Chill', 'Wow', 'feel', 'intelligent', 'now.Seriously', 'beginning', 'was', 'so', 'god-awful', 'bad', 'turned', 'movie', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'kept', 'watching', 'end', 'when', 'referred', 'back', 'beginning', 'complete', 'cycle', 'formula', 'was', 'complete', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'downright', 'painful', 'stupidity', 'everything', 'was', 'brilliant', 'How', 'strange.Look', 'cast', 'will', 'expect', 'great', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'get', 'already', 'knew', 'Rita', 'Rudner', 'perceptive', 'funny', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'would', 'expect', 'translate', 'writing', 'out', 'can', 'act', 'too.Actually', 'see', '3.5', '3.75', 'stars', 'here', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'complimentary', 'thought', ""'d"", 'rein', 'bit', 'character-driven', 'perceptive', 'gem', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'generous', 'assume', 'sexpot', 'character', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'bit', 'annoying', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'name', 'care', 'fine', 'film', 'indeed']",Peter's Friends VHS
333199,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302767741,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Peter's Friends' is a pretty fun and entertaining film that has the right amount of wit and charm to make the film feel relevant and fresh, even if some of the themes are a tad out of date in today's world.  Still, there is an air of impact because of the setting and the dedication of the cast to the material.  The cast is exceptional, with stellar performances from everyone involved.Stephen Fry anchors the film with his soft and sincere depiction of a grown man trying for the first time to act grown.  Kenneth Branagh (who also directed the film) has a very relaxed and charismatic presence, and it bodes well for his development of character.  Thompson, Staunton and Laurie cycle the more serious roles with ease, and Emmanuel and Slattery are standouts as the new `couple' in the group.  With Rudner providing comedic relief, and Phyllida Law hanging behind as a paternal observer, this cast is to die for!The film opens with a hilarious and perfectly laid out sequence of six friends performing a cabaret together for the last time.  After that, shoot forward in time to friends living separate lives and far removed from each other for years (ten to be exact).  After Peter's father dies he invites all of his friends to his father's mansion for one last New Year's Eve party.  Each friend brings with them some baggage and over the course of the vacation they open those suitcases and share that baggage with everyone in the home.  Tears are shed, laughs are had and smiles cross faces; not to mention some yelling and fighting and love making.The dialog keeps coming and keeps the film moving, and the storyline, while a tad `step by step' in parts, is nicely woven.  It isn't a film that I'll come back to over and over, and it isn't a film that I'll look back on as a `great film' (it tries to make a serious point, or points, but it doesn't have the heft needed to really do that) but it is a very good film with a solid foundation that I can't help but enjoy.",4,A nice surprise...,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,1976,"['Peter', 'Friends', 'pretty', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'right', 'amount', 'wit', 'charm', 'make', 'film', 'feel', 'relevant', 'fresh', 'even', 'themes', 'are', 'tad', 'date', 'today', 'world', 'Still', 'air', 'impact', 'setting', 'dedication', 'cast', 'material', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'stellar', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved.Stephen', 'Fry', 'film', 'soft', 'sincere', 'depiction', 'grown', 'man', 'trying', 'first', 'time', 'act', 'grown', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'very', 'relaxed', 'charismatic', 'presence', 'well', 'development', 'character', 'Thompson', 'Staunton', 'Laurie', 'cycle', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'ease', 'Emmanuel', 'Slattery', 'are', 'standouts', 'new', 'couple', 'group', 'Rudner', 'providing', 'comedic', 'relief', 'Phyllida', 'Law', 'hanging', 'behind', 'paternal', 'observer', 'cast', 'die', 'film', 'hilarious', 'perfectly', 'laid', 'out', 'sequence', 'six', 'friends', 'performing', 'cabaret', 'together', 'last', 'time', 'shoot', 'forward', 'time', 'friends', 'living', 'separate', 'lives', 'far', 'removed', 'other', 'years', 'ten', 'be', 'exact', 'Peter', 'father', 'friends', 'father', 'mansion', 'one', 'last', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', 'friend', 'baggage', 'course', 'vacation', 'open', 'suitcases', 'share', 'baggage', 'everyone', 'home', 'Tears', 'are', 'shed', 'are', 'had', 'smiles', 'cross', 'not', 'mention', 'yelling', 'fighting', 'love', 'making.The', 'dialog', 'coming', 'film', 'moving', 'storyline', 'tad', 'step', 'step', 'parts', 'nicely', 'woven', ""n't"", 'film', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', ""n't"", 'film', ""'ll"", 'look', 'back', 'great', 'film', 'make', 'serious', 'point', 'points', ""n't"", 'have', 'heft', 'needed', 'really', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'solid', 'foundation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy']",Peter's Friends VHS

333205,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,6302767741,Earl Hazell,"[29, 32]","How often do you see a movie in which women are acknowledging how their egos, denied feelings, self-destructive behaviors and deep lonliness are  making them obliterate their relationships before the men in their lives  ever have a chance to? And how often do you see that without the kind of  heavy handed comedy that is usually designed as a secret apology for doing  anything but infantilizing women via romance and triumph over  victimization?That alone makes the movie worth seeing.  The men and  women in this film are going through a lot of stuff, not the least of which  wishing they could go back to the time when life seemed to make sense- when  they were all together and much closer as friends.  But they can only move  forward: they can only accept the degree to which they are products of  their environment, and how that degree is much smaller than what they would  like to believe- in fact, to what degree they constructed their  environments through their choices in life.  One couple, married, still  grieving the death of a child, must face the anger at each other and  themselves- and God- before it destroys their marriage like a cancer; and  the husband leads the way.  One woman must face how she manipulates men  into severing their relationships with other women for her, only to blow  them off dazed and brokenhearted when there is nothing left to stand in the  way of her committing herself to them, including their old lives. Another  must come to terms with his sexuality enough to share it with his friends,  one of which has fallen in love with him, for all the wrong reasons.  The  comedy in this film is there by necessity I think moreso than artifice or  decoration; if you don't laugh at times at how confusing and hard life can  be you can't live it.  It balances out the transformation each character  must go through in order to get on with their lives, and be true to the  friendships they have reestablished that they owe so much joy and  revalation to.The acting in this movie is wonderful, and through it  all, there are some pretty funny scenes.  The movie as a whole though can  have the effect of having your soul scrubbed with a scouring pad if you see  yourself or any life experience reflected in the characters.  And if you  think you can relate to anyone of them, or think you know someone who is  like one of them, you probably will.A very special movie.  Don't rent  it for a group of friends, unless you're prepared to go through a similiar  roller coaster- and then be closer to them all then you ever have been  before.",4,"An honest, touching movie about friendship, and being human",966384000,"08 16, 2000",2000,2574,"['How', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'movie', 'women', 'are', 'acknowledging', 'how', 'egos', 'denied', 'feelings', 'self-destructive', 'behaviors', 'deep', 'lonliness', 'are', 'making', 'obliterate', 'relationships', 'men', 'lives', 'ever', 'have', 'chance', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'kind', 'heavy', 'handed', 'comedy', 'usually', 'designed', 'secret', 'apology', 'doing', 'anything', 'infantilizing', 'women', 'romance', 'triumph', 'victimization', 'alone', 'movie', 'seeing', 'men', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'lot', 'stuff', 'not', 'least', 'wishing', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'life', 'seemed', 'make', 'sense-', 'when', 'were', 'together', 'much', 'closer', 'friends', 'can', 'only', 'move', 'forward', 'can', 'only', 'accept', 'degree', 'are', 'products', 'environment', 'how', 'degree', 'much', 'smaller', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'believe-', 'fact', 'what', 'degree', 'constructed', 'environments', 'choices', 'life', 'One', 'couple', 'married', 'still', 'grieving', 'death', 'child', 'must', 'face', 'anger', 'other', 'themselves-', 'God-', 'marriage', 'cancer', 'husband', 'way', 'One', 'woman', 'must', 'face', 'how', 'men', 'severing', 'relationships', 'other', 'women', 'only', 'blow', 'off', 'dazed', 'brokenhearted', 'when', 'nothing', 'left', 'stand', 'way', 'committing', 'including', 'old', 'lives', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'enough', 'share', 'friends', 'one', 'fallen', 'love', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'comedy', 'film', 'there', 'necessity', 'think', 'moreso', 'artifice', 'decoration', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'times', 'how', 'confusing', 'hard', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'out', 'transformation', 'character', 'must', 'go', 'order', 'get', 'lives', 'be', 'true', 'friendships', 'have', 'reestablished', 'owe', 'so', 'much', 'joy', 'revalation', 'to.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'whole', 'though', 'can', 'have', 'effect', 'having', 'soul', 'scrubbed', 'scouring', 'pad', 'see', 'life', 'experience', 'reflected', 'characters', 'think', 'can', 'relate', 'anyone', 'think', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'one', 'probably', 'will.A', 'very', 'special', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'group', 'friends', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'go', 'similiar', 'roller', 'coaster-', 'then', 'be', 'closer', 'then', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'before']",Peter's Friends VHS

With a brilliant opening scene, and the credits traveling from the last time they were all together in 1982 (with political break throughs and famous people littering the screne set to the great Tears for Fears tune &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;) and a brilliant story line, Peter's Friends is once of the best independant films out there. Directed and acted by the great British Kenneth Branaugh with Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry as Peter, and Imelda Staunton, it's no wonder this is such a terrific flick.Set on New Year's Eve, 1992, each person comes to Peter's estate for one last new years in his house, since Peter's father died. It has been 10 years since they had all been together, performing a small cabaret show to anyone who would actually want them there to perform. Now, all the friends have been married, movied away, or in destructive (or no) relationships. During the course of the weekend, they all rediscover one another as well as discover who they are.

As others have noted, this is really just a Transatlantic imitation of The Big Chill. I don't like that film much, either, and so I'm of course not going to be crazy about watching an imitator. There are some clever lines, I will admit, but each character has become mired in his or her personal rut since the group last reunited, and each rut is stated and restated and analyzed in about every facile and melodramatic manner one could imagine. Still, there's a lot of talent on that screen, and while I cringe at the script I can admire the actors' attempts to salvage it.

333213,A2WJCE8VF3STFW,6302767741,Judith,"[3, 3]","Yes, the premise is the same as the Big Chill, but the story, characters, and feel of the movies are completely different.  They are not at all similar, and should not be compared and judged against one another.  Peter and friends do not sit around thinking about how idealistic they once were, and now look at us--which was the theme of the Big Chill.  I like and enjoy both movies.So, Peter's Friends is about a group of old college friends who used to perform in a musical revue.  They and some of their significant others gather at the stately home of Peter for a New Year's weekend.  The host is Peter, a man who may be gay, or maybe he's bisexual, or is he asexual, or is he just not sure?  Roger and Mary were both part of the college musical act.  They have married and are successful jingle writers, but the death of one of their infant twins has put a strain on them and their marriage.  Mary has turned into an over protective mother, obsessed with worry about the remaining twin.  Maggie is a ""plain Jane"" who wants to avoid impending spinster-hood, so she sets her cap for Peter, who as I already stated, isn't sure if he's interested in sex with anybody.  Sarah has had a long string of boyfriends because she only dates men who are married or involved with another woman.  She brings along her latest married lover, an obnoxious jerk that the others all loathe at first sight.  Andrew is a writer who has gone Hollywood, and isn't very satisfied by his successful career or his marriage to a fitness obsessed American actress.There are some dramatic scemes, as well as some very funny scenes.  I particularly like Rita Rudner's performance as the over the top glam actress who piles on layers of fake hair.  One of the best lines is when she asks the uncooperative housekeeper ""Have you never seen Upstairs, Downstairs?""This is a movie you can watch over and over.  I'd like to have most of these people as friends--except for Sarah and Brian.  &lt;smile>",5,Not a British Big Chill,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,1970,"['Yes', 'premise', 'same', 'Big', 'Chill', 'story', 'characters', 'feel', 'movies', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'are', 'not', 'similar', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'judged', 'one', 'Peter', 'friends', 'do', 'not', 'sit', 'thinking', 'how', 'idealistic', 'once', 'were', 'now', 'look', 'was', 'theme', 'Big', 'Chill', 'like', 'enjoy', 'movies.So', 'Peter', 'Friends', 'group', 'old', 'college', 'friends', 'who', 'used', 'perform', 'musical', 'revue', 'significant', 'others', 'gather', 'stately', 'home', 'Peter', 'New', 'Year', 'weekend', 'host', 'Peter', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'gay', 'maybe', 'bisexual', 'asexual', 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'Roger', 'Mary', 'were', 'part', 'college', 'musical', 'act', 'have', 'married', 'are', 'successful', 'jingle', 'writers', 'death', 'one', 'infant', 'put', 'strain', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'turned', 'protective', 'mother', 'obsessed', 'worry', 'remaining', 'twin', 'Maggie', 'plain', 'Jane', 'who', 'avoid', 'impending', 'spinster-hood', 'cap', 'Peter', 'who', 'already', 'stated', ""n't"", 'sure', 'interested', 'sex', 'anybody', 'Sarah', 'had', 'long', 'string', 'boyfriends', 'only', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'involved', 'woman', 'latest', 'married', 'lover', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'others', 'loathe', 'first', 'sight', 'Andrew', 'writer', 'who', 'gone', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'very', 'satisfied', 'successful', 'career', 'marriage', 'fitness', 'obsessed', 'American', 'are', 'dramatic', 'scemes', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Rita', 'Rudner', 'performance', 'top', 'glam', 'actress', 'who', 'layers', 'fake', 'hair', 'One', 'best', 'lines', 'when', 'uncooperative', 'housekeeper', 'Have', 'never', 'seen', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'most', 'people', 'friends', 'Sarah', 'Brian', 'lt', 'smile', '>']",Peter's Friends VHS

Everyone gives 110% in their respective roles. I was familiar with Branagh, Thompson, Fry, Laurie, and Rudner before seeing this, and even the ones I wasn't familliar with still played convincingly. There was just so much chemestry between all of the actors. I showed this to a friend yesterday, and he loved it. The humor (especially Branagh's) was right on target, and it made us laugh even after the film was over. My friend (who is an aspiring writer) told me that some of the scenes in the film sounded like something he would've thought up. I liked the opening credits of Peter's Friends as well. They go through all the pop culture starting in 1982 (where the movie begins) and ending up in 1992 (where the movie picks up after the credits). A soundtrack of familiar '80s songs in also helpful. Many people will compare this to The Big Chill, but this one stands alone and in most cases, better than The Big Chill. Peter's Friends is an example of how to make a funny entertaining film that people can relate to a personal level.
