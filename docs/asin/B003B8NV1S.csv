My husband and I only lasted 18 minutes but what a wonderful 18 minutes it was.  The time flew by and we kept up pretty well for the first time.  We will feel it tomorrow I am sure.  Erin is motivating, cues well, demonstrates and starts off at a slower pace to get the positioning and technique then speeds it up.  It is all so do-able.  As soon as we reached our maximum (we are older adults) my husband announced ""She is a keeper!"".  There are a lot of exercise DVD's we have really enjoyed but this will go to the top of our collection.",5,Recommeded in Prevention Magazine and no wonder!,1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,659,"['ordered', 'based', 'advertisement', 'Prevention', 'magazine', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'Amazon', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'husband', 'only', 'lasted', '18', 'minutes', 'what', 'wonderful', '18', 'minutes', 'was', 'time', 'flew', 'kept', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'feel', 'tomorrow', 'am', 'sure', 'Erin', 'motivating', 'cues', 'well', 'demonstrates', 'off', 'slower', 'pace', 'get', 'positioning', 'technique', 'then', 'up', 'so', 'do-able', 'As', 'soon', 'reached', 'maximum', 'are', 'older', 'adults', 'husband', 'announced', 'keeper', 'are', 'lot', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'go', 'top', 'collection']",N/A

Strong Body, Ageless Body was my 1st workout with Erin and it's a wonderful gem of a workout that is not well known in the video fitness community, but it's a personal favorite of mine.Strong Body, Fit Body kicks it up a couple of notches with a few short plyo segments between some very functional compound exercises.  The heartrate stays up there throughout the workout, which is about 45 minutes.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because Erin does some supine ab work near the end (not too much of it, but I don't do supine abwork anymore).Erin is encouraging and enthusiastic, and some might find her a little too jovial for their taste, but I love her great attitude.I love the end credits, where the director (?) asks various crew members why they exercise...awesome and honest responses.I certainly hope that Erin continues to put out more ""Strong Body"" workouts!",4,Little known instructor creates one of the best workouts in 2010,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,985,"['Erin', ""O'Brien"", 'not', 'well', 'known', 'instructor', 'Cathe', 'Tony', 'Chalene', 'should', 'be', 'Strong', 'Body', 'Ageless', 'Body', 'was', '1st', 'workout', 'Erin', 'wonderful', 'gem', 'workout', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'video', 'fitness', 'community', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine.Strong', 'Body', 'Fit', 'Body', 'up', 'couple', 'notches', 'few', 'short', 'plyo', 'segments', 'very', 'functional', 'compound', 'exercises', 'heartrate', 'workout', '45', 'minutes.The', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'Erin', 'supine', 'ab', 'work', 'end', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'supine', 'abwork', 'anymore', '.Erin', 'encouraging', 'enthusiastic', 'might', 'find', 'little', 'too', 'jovial', 'taste', 'love', 'great', 'attitude.I', 'end', 'credits', 'where', 'director', 'various', 'crew', 'members', 'why', 'exercise', 'awesome', 'honest', 'responses.I', 'certainly', 'hope', 'Erin', 'put', 'out', 'more', 'Strong', 'Body', 'workouts']",N/A
1335391,A37EGMGQROQJTT,B003B8NV1S,L. Clarice,"[24, 25]","I love Erin O'Brien's new Strong Body, Fit Body workout DVD. Just like her previous workout DVD, Strong Body, Ageless Body, this one focuses on improving upper body strength using hand weights. You don't need anything but a towel, water, and 5 to 6 pound weights. This workout is a lot tougher than her previous DVD, but worth every 46 minutes. It's such a fun workout! She ends the workout with a longer full body stretch, which is a great improvement over her last DVD. What I like most about this DVD is that she incorporates the hand weights in every routine, plus jumps and lunges that don't hurt your knees. The core and cardio part is well balanced throughout the workout. This DVD is broken up into several 7 minutes routines that you can play alone or all together.

Now in my mid-50's, I'm very interested in maintaining my health, but am aware I need to focus on exercising in ways that won't injure or damage my joints, but will protect and possibly strengthen them and I believe Erin O'Brien's DVDs do that.After using the Strong Body, Ageless Body over a few weeks, I tried Strong Body Fit Body and found it much more challenging - but not to the point of being ridiculous.  It is recommended women start out with 5 pound weights and work up to 8 pounds, with the recommended starting weight for men at 8 - working up to 10 pounds.The cueing on the exercises is excellent, giving informative instruction on form and what muscles are being worked - and breathing tips.  Occasionally she'll tell you what form mistakes not to make, helping you to increase your effectiveness and to avoid injury.  While the routine has enough intensity for it to be a cardio workout, it is easy to follow.  Erin introduces you to the combination moves in steps often starting out slowly so you can learn and perform the moves with proper form, but it's never confusing.  I like her coaching style, which is calm, encouraging and motivating without being either a drill seargant or too perky. She makes you want to make it through the whole set, acknowledging that it's tough, but that you can do it.There are a few high impact exercises (which help boost the heartrate and give a cardio effect), but they're spaced far enough apart that they weren't a problem for me, even with my cranky feet.  I was sweaty when I finished the workout, but felt energized instead of wiped out afterward. Overall, there is nothing in these workouts that make me concerned that I'm going to injure myself.I like these two workouts so well I wish there were more - and will definitely buy any others that she releases - and I highly recommend both this and Strong Body Ageless Body.",5,Excellent  Workout,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,2241,"['just', 'happened', 'Erin', ""O'Brien"", 'one', 'day', 'had', 'great', 'reviews', 'thanks', 'who', 'took', 'time', 'write', 'review', 'were', 'remarkably', 'inexpensive', 'purchased', 'Strong', 'Body', 'Fit', 'BodyandStrong', 'Body', 'Ageless', 'Body', 'Erin', ""O'Brienon"", 'whim.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exercising', 'years', 'would', 'rate', 'fitness', 'level', 'intermediate', 'Now', 'mid-50', ""'m"", 'very', 'interested', 'maintaining', 'health', 'am', 'aware', 'need', 'focus', 'exercising', 'ways', 'wo', ""n't"", 'injure', 'damage', 'joints', 'will', 'protect', 'possibly', 'strengthen', 'believe', 'Erin', ""O'Brien"", 'DVDs', 'do', 'that.After', 'using', 'Strong', 'Body', 'Ageless', 'Body', 'few', 'weeks', 'tried', 'Strong', 'Body', 'Fit', 'Body', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'challenging', 'not', 'point', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'recommended', 'women', 'start', '5', 'pound', 'weights', 'work', 'up', '8', 'pounds', 'recommended', 'starting', 'weight', 'men', '8', 'working', 'up', '10', 'pounds.The', 'cueing', 'exercises', 'excellent', 'giving', 'informative', 'instruction', 'form', 'what', 'muscles', 'are', 'being', 'worked', 'breathing', 'tips', 'Occasionally', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'form', 'not', 'make', 'helping', 'increase', 'effectiveness', 'avoid', 'injury', 'routine', 'enough', 'intensity', 'be', 'cardio', 'workout', 'easy', 'follow', 'Erin', 'combination', 'moves', 'steps', 'often', 'starting', 'out', 'slowly', 'can', 'learn', 'perform', 'moves', 'proper', 'form', 'never', 'confusing', 'coaching', 'style', 'calm', 'encouraging', 'motivating', 'being', 'drill', 'seargant', 'too', 'perky', 'want', 'make', 'whole', 'set', 'acknowledging', 'tough', 'can', 'do', 'it.There', 'are', 'few', 'high', 'impact', 'exercises', 'help', 'boost', 'heartrate', 'give', 'cardio', 'effect', ""'re"", 'spaced', 'far', 'enough', 'apart', 'were', ""n't"", 'problem', 'even', 'cranky', 'feet', 'was', 'sweaty', 'when', 'finished', 'workout', 'felt', 'energized', 'instead', 'wiped', 'out', 'afterward', 'Overall', 'nothing', 'workouts', 'make', 'concerned', ""'m"", 'going', 'injure', 'myself.I', 'two', 'workouts', 'so', 'well', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'will', 'definitely', 'buy', 'others', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Strong', 'Body', 'Ageless', 'Body']",N/A
