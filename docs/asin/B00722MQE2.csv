Faith in those you love/trust, and what seems impossible actually can become tomorrow's reality.  All the kids needed was a fair chance.  Putting their special educational needs on the back burner for awhile and these kids(and the teachers who believed in them) showed that intelligience is not always measured by one's IQ. This is a true live story that will erase many of your doubts about those who can and those who are labelled &#34;incapable because....&#34;angie",5,SHOOT FOR THE STARS,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,537,"['amazing', 'inspiring', 'story', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'Faith', 'love/trust', 'what', 'impossible', 'actually', 'can', 'become', 'tomorrow', 'reality', 'kids', 'needed', 'was', 'fair', 'chance', 'Putting', 'special', 'educational', 'needs', 'back', 'burner', 'awhile', 'kids', 'teachers', 'who', 'believed', 'showed', 'intelligience', 'not', 'always', 'measured', 'one', 'IQ', 'true', 'live', 'story', 'will', 'erase', 'many', 'doubts', 'who', 'can', 'who', 'are', 'labelled', '34', 'incapable', '34', 'angie']",Hallmark a Smile As Big As the Moon

If you know of any 'Special Ed' kids, they will really relate (as will their parents and friends).  The best part is that it's a true story and that is majorly encouraging!  The acting is supurb and the Special Ed teacher deserves many rewards for sticking with these kids through thick and thin!!

1524350,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,B00722MQE2,David W. Jones,"[1, 1]","A Smile as Big as the Moon tells the true story of a special education teacher who tries to get his students to highly competitive Space Camp.  The students struggle with a variety of disabilities: ADHD, Tourettes, OCD, dyslexia, bipolar disorder, autism, etc.  Yet he sets the bar high and pits them against high-achieving students from other schools.The film is fairly typical Hallmark fare--and that is a good thing.  It is a predictable but nonetheless inspiring, feel-good story.  For those who are used to Hollywood movies that focus on the gritty (and often depressing) side of life, this film will seem cheesy.  But for those of us who have grown tired of gritty, this is a breath of fresh air.I was pleased with the visual quality of this DVD.  It was as good as some Blu-ray transfers I have seen.  Good level of detail and strong colors.  The audio was a bit problematic, however.  Dialogue was strong, but the soundtrack was soft to the point of distraction.  It would have benefitted from more volume.Parental Advisory: Apart from some occasional bullying and flaring tempers, there is nothing objectionable in this film.  It is suitable for all ages.  In fact, parents could use this film as a good launching point for a discussion with their children about bullying.If you are looking for some heart-warming, family entertainment, look no further.  Highly recommended.",4,The Right Stuff,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,1383,"['Smile', 'as', 'Big', 'Moon', 'true', 'story', 'special', 'education', 'teacher', 'who', 'get', 'students', 'highly', 'competitive', 'Space', 'Camp', 'students', 'struggle', 'variety', 'disabilities', 'ADHD', 'Tourettes', 'OCD', 'dyslexia', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'autism', 'etc', 'bar', 'high', 'high-achieving', 'students', 'other', 'schools.The', 'film', 'fairly', 'typical', 'Hallmark', 'fare', 'good', 'thing', 'predictable', 'nonetheless', 'inspiring', 'feel-good', 'story', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'focus', 'gritty', 'often', 'depressing', 'side', 'life', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'cheesy', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'tired', 'gritty', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.I', 'was', 'pleased', 'visual', 'quality', 'DVD', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Blu-ray', 'transfers', 'have', 'seen', 'Good', 'level', 'detail', 'strong', 'colors', 'audio', 'was', 'bit', 'problematic', 'however', 'Dialogue', 'was', 'strong', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'soft', 'point', 'distraction', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'more', 'volume.Parental', 'Advisory', 'Apart', 'occasional', 'bullying', 'flaring', 'tempers', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'film', 'suitable', 'ages', 'fact', 'parents', 'could', 'use', 'film', 'good', 'launching', 'point', 'discussion', 'children', 'bullying.If', 'are', 'looking', 'heart-warming', 'family', 'entertainment', 'look', 'further', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Hallmark a Smile As Big As the Moon

Right? Almost everyone thought so, but was proved wrong.The coach had a vision and dream for his students. To him, conventional special ed camps were uninspiring. He said, ""I am sick and tired of others saying that these kids cannot do anything.""Why not try something unheard of--space camp? The challenges are formidable. NASA must be convinced to permit this. He has to raise fifty thousand dollars. He must get his students to believe in themselves and to work together. Some of them must overcome their saucy attitudes when corrected. They must stop insulting and fighting with each other. If they make it to camp and fight, it will only support those who contend that special ed teens do not belong at space camp.The students drill and practice. They memorize mountains of facts. They learn to assemble a triangle underwater in a swimming pool. One of them assembles a large plastic model of the shuttle that an adult would have difficulty building. One of them becomes the leader that he is capable of being. So much work is involved!The photography of the NASA equipment at the space camp is outstanding. You get to see a spin-simulator, virtual-reality shuttle interior, and much more.The door for the students opens and the spotlight is on them. So says the coach.
