382049,AGAJITEU64H4A,6303619983,Cheri Crystal,"[8, 9]","""The Sum of Us"" is a beautiful story about the unconditional love between a widowed father, Harry (Jack Thompson), and his openly gay son, Jeff (Russell Crowe). The movie shows a rare glimpse of a father's acceptance and willingness to try and understand his son's sexuality. When Jeff has a date, Harry is there to make sure his son practices safe sex, and when Harry has a stroke, Jeff is there to assume sole responsibility for his care, preparing his meals, helping him get around, and taking care of all his needs. They may drive each other crazy at times, but their unselfish acts of love for each other are heartwarming without being sickeningly sweet. I love this movie because it is honest, funny, wonderfully acted, hopeful, and real. Russell Crowe gives a brilliant performance early in his career. He is so believable you forget you are watching a movie. Jack Thompson is perfectly cast as his father. He is warm and funny. I recommend this movie to anyone that has ever loved or has ever been in love. It is a feel good movie.

(most gays in movies are either all about sex, or are nice and funny--but seem asexual) The father also is a well-developed character who embarks on a relationship of his own.I'm not wild, though, about the talking to the camera bits--especially in a couple of instances when one character physically can't speak at all.

The play is brilliant (I directed a community theatre version several years back) and the movie remains very true to the play.If I had to make a comparison, it would be to Steel Magnolias - and that's not really fair to either play/film. My comparison is not so much on the content as it is to the theme and the way it plays out during the course of each. The first act (and yes, films can have acts) sets up the characters for the audience. It allows us to get to know these people. This is an effective mechanism if the characters have any substance and bear getting to know. It is also the act where the humor is rapid fire (think the dialogue in Truvy's hair salon). In The Sum of Us, the first act is filled with heartwarming knowledge and second hand stories that will have you laughing yourself sick.The second act (most plays today only have two) is tragedy lightly peppered with humor (the graveyard scene after Shelby's death - and here the grocery store after the father's stroke).There is not a single bad performance by any actor in this film. In fact, it's full of top notch Austrailian actors of both stage and screen. It was this film that introduced me to Russell Crowe (who would go on to win an Oscar for Gladiator and deliver wowing performances in L.A. Confidential and others).Russell Crowe as the gay son who has no luck in the romance department has a very cool father who, while he would prefer his son were straight, knows that what he really wants is his son to be happy. His father, in fact, constantly tries to push his son into a relationship with one or another of his dates. This has varying hilarious results. (In a second hand story we are told that the father interrupted the son and a date while they were &quot;coupling&quot;. The response to the son from the father upon seeing this: &quot;Mind the sheets.&quot;).I've already given too much away, although this isn't a film to be watched for surprise, but rather an elegant and eloquent character study that shows us that love and patience can truly conquer all.",5,Powerful!

The fine acting here should convince anyone-- should they need convincing-- of just how awful Will Smith's similar scenes were in ""Six Degrees of Separation.""

We start with the promise of a revolution coming through and we end with a request or piece of advice that you better be home soon, and in between, love, romance, tragedy and a lot of empathy and misery with a little bit of happiness sprinkled on top, at times angry happiness because of the silly decision you took and it broke the potential happy development you were hoping for and looking forward to getting on a silver platter. You just got Saint John the Baptist's head.We are dealing here with grown up men and women all in strange situations. A young gay man living with his parents and the father behaves as if he did not know and he turns ugly when it becomes news stuff on TV. Another gay man living with his widower of a father who is not gay but accepts his son the way he is though he is invasive, maybe an intrusive voyeur, and in a way blocks his son's way to happiness.That same man gets in touch with a lady through some meeting club and the two fall for one another but the night when things were going to go through, New Year's Eve, at his place, the son being out for his own fun, she comes across some gay magazines and cannot accept the fact that she had not been told before, and if she had it would not have changed anything because she just does not want to go across this line.Just minutes after she drove off, when the fireworks start celebrating the New Year, he has a savage and wild heart attack or stroke and he will remain paralyzed on one side and without the capability to speak any more. In other words she broke his heart and that is not a metaphor, she literally did break his heart, boom.That is sad, very sad, but it is a comedy, so there must be a happy ending and life will take care of some haphazard meeting of the two young men and then life will be on tracks again. But gosh it is not easy to build your own happiness when you are not a photocopy of the standard middle of the way unoriginal model imposed by ethical and moral norms in our society, even when things have changed legally. Between the law and reality there is more than a simple Strait of Malacca: there are thousands of hostile pirates with weapons everywhere up over their heads ready to raid your life to prevent you from being happy.Enjoy the details.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,So sad we could believe it is a true story,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,2353,"['comedy', 'one', 'more', 'life', 'so', 'little', 'comic', 'indeed', 'start', 'promise', 'revolution', 'coming', 'end', 'request', 'piece', 'advice', 'better', 'be', 'home', 'soon', 'love', 'romance', 'tragedy', 'lot', 'empathy', 'misery', 'little', 'bit', 'happiness', 'sprinkled', 'top', 'times', 'angry', 'happiness', 'silly', 'decision', 'took', 'broke', 'potential', 'happy', 'development', 'were', 'hoping', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'silver', 'platter', 'just', 'got', 'Saint', 'John', 'Baptist', 'head.We', 'are', 'dealing', 'here', 'grown', 'up', 'men', 'women', 'strange', 'situations', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'living', 'parents', 'father', 'as', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'ugly', 'when', 'news', 'stuff', 'TV', 'gay', 'man', 'living', 'widower', 'father', 'who', 'not', 'gay', 'son', 'way', 'invasive', 'maybe', 'intrusive', 'voyeur', 'way', 'son', 'way', 'happiness.That', 'same', 'man', 'touch', 'lady', 'meeting', 'club', 'two', 'fall', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'place', 'son', 'being', 'out', 'own', 'fun', 'gay', 'magazines', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'fact', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'had', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'changed', 'anything', 'just', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'line.Just', 'minutes', 'drove', 'off', 'when', 'fireworks', 'start', 'celebrating', 'New', 'Year', 'savage', 'wild', 'heart', 'attack', 'stroke', 'will', 'remain', 'paralyzed', 'one', 'side', 'capability', 'speak', 'more', 'other', 'words', 'broke', 'heart', 'not', 'metaphor', 'literally', 'did', 'break', 'heart', 'boom.That', 'sad', 'very', 'sad', 'comedy', 'must', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'life', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'haphazard', 'meeting', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'then', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'tracks', 'again', 'gosh', 'not', 'easy', 'build', 'own', 'happiness', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'photocopy', 'standard', 'middle', 'way', 'unoriginal', 'model', 'imposed', 'ethical', 'moral', 'norms', 'society', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'legally', 'Between', 'law', 'reality', 'more', 'simple', 'Strait', 'Malacca', 'are', 'thousands', 'hostile', 'pirates', 'weapons', 'everywhere', 'up', 'heads', 'ready', 'raid', 'life', 'prevent', 'being', 'details.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",The Sum of Us VHS

382065,AD9WTAOAFUZA4,6303619983,"Jose R. Perez ""Jose""","[13, 14]","""The Sum of Us"" offers comedy and heartfelt drama in spades, and features a young, charming Russell Crowe in an early role as a gay son living with his straight father, played beautifully by Jack Thompson.  Aside from being a character study that blends intimate family moments with universal truths ANY audience will relate to, the film dares to stretch further than most literate ""gay themed"" movies, and succeeds on all levels.It also features several heartwrenching scenes that deserve a place in cinema history for being truly affecting, irrespective of issues or morals surrounding human sexuality.  Specifically, a relationship between two elderly women - Crowe's grandmother, and her longtime companion Mary - is etched in a powerful, human way that defies categorization.  The women grow old together until each of their families decide they can no longer care for each other and separate them against their will.  There are moments between the two actresses that will literally take your breath away - that is anyone who has a pulse will find themselves ripped apart by a sequence where Thompson describes what it must have been like for the two women to spend a final night together, holding on for dear life, knowing they only have a few moments left on the planet as a couple.  It's a brutal eloquent moment, rarely captured in film, and far surpassing the crocodile nature of tearjerkers like ""Terms of Endearment.""  If you've ever loved someone with all your heart, you will quickly put yourself in the women's shoes, contemplating what life would be like without your significant other at your side.  Unlike death, the separation of these two soul mates ranks among the most startling, affecting moments of pure sadness any filmmaker has ever fully realized.This is a vivid look at relationships and families that deserves a wide worldwide audience.  The DVD is available only in Canada, but the video version is worth the price - not only for Crowe and Thompson, who shine in what could've been run-of-the-mill roles, but for the eloquence with which it captures true, undying love.

The twist here is that the child (Russell Crowe) is a strapping gay man and the parent (Jack Thompson) is a widowed father entirely sympathetic to his son's lifestyle and need for romance. The early, farcical going has plenty of low-voltage laughs, as the well-meaning Thompson inadvertently breaks up a planned hot evening between Crowe and a new potential lover, and Thompson utilizes a dating service to meet an attractive divorcee. The two principals address the camera in knowing asides a la ""Shirley Valentine."" Halfway through, though, the story takes unexpected, darker turns and ""The Sum of Us"" attains a new level of profundity, becoming a moving meditation on the enduring strength of love, both familial and romantic, in the face of adversity. Crowe, caught here before the calcification of Hollywood superstardom, is loose, just buff enough, and charming; Thompson's turn as the father, by turns overbearing, loving and finally dependent on his son, is superb.

The two have a close and loving relationship and Dad is forever trying to fix Jeff up with nice men.  Harry, a widower, misses being in love and tries a computer dating service for himself; the lady he meets seems just about perfect, until he tells her about his son.This is a very sweet father and son story, with Crowe and Thompson both convincing, sympathetic, and utterly likeable in their roles.  Filmed in Sydney, the thick Aussie accents and slang may be a bit hard to understand at times, but they make the story seem very real and intimate.  I would have given the film five stars (I did give it 3.5 stars) had it not been for the very annoying gimmick of having the actors break character and talk directly to the camera every few minutes.  This was especially distracting when the father, paralyzed and mute from a stroke, suddenly started moving and speaking normally.  I gather this is a holdover from the stage play, but it definitely destroyed the continuity; each time an actor spoke to the audience, we were reminded that it's only acting and we had to start all over in our willing suspension of disbelief.  It would have been so much better if they had just used voice-overs or, better yet, skipped the narrations altogether.Since no story lines are concluded, this is basically a slice-of-life drama, a peek into a life shared by father and son.  The sight of Russell Crowe in footie shorts is reason enough to watch this movie; his many fans will enjoy seeing him in his pre-Hollywood days in this simple and lovely love story.",4,"""Ashamed of Jeff?

Adapted by David Stevens from his own off-Broadway play of the same name, ""The Sum of Us"" is the story of a widowed father, Harry Mitchell (Harry Thompson, who played in the 1980 film ""Breaker Morant"" and the 2002 film ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones""), and his rugby-playing, 24-year-old gay son, Jeff Mitchell (Russell Crowe).  The two maintain a strong father-son bond, but each is searching to find companionship and happiness while continuing to contend with the death of Jeff's mother.  Harry, who is a ferryboat captain, does much of the cooking and housework for himself and Jeff, and is completely accepting of his son's sexual orientation.  Jeff, who works as a plumber, assists his father around the house that they share while struggling to find descent men to date.One night, Jeff meets someone, Greg (John Polson), and brings him home on a date.  Harry's enthusiasm for Jeff actually having a date encourages him to benevolently intrude on their time together.  After Harry finally leaves, Jeff and Greg begin to share some intimacy, but a final interruption from the well-meaning Harry ends their date prematurely.  Greg, who cannot be open about his sexuality with his own parents, becomes uncomfortable in the unaccustomed, but accepting environment of the Mitchell's home.  Harry, who also makes efforts to find love, meets the divorc&eacute;e Joyce Johnson (Deborah Kennedy).  A strong romance develops between them, but when Joyce inadvertently discovers that Jeff is gay, she leaves Harry.  Shortly thereafter, Harry suffers a severe stroke that leaves him mostly paralyzed and unable to speak, but Jeff takes care of him.  Jeff hasn't forgotten about Greg, whose life has also changed.Sadly, ""The Sum of Us"" received little attention in the U.S. following its release and no Oscar recognition, but it did win the Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Adapted Screenplay.  It was also nominated by the AFI for Best Film, Best Editing and Best Sound, and John Polson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, as was Deborah Kennedy for Best Supporting Actress.  Overall, I rate ""The Sum of Us"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  I applaud writer David Stevens and co-directors Geoff Burton and Kevin Dowling for their portrayal of an affirmative relationship between a father and his gay son in a bittersweet comedic drama.  The film sends a positive message to the audience regarding tolerance and acceptance, while simultaneously showing the pain endured when intolerance and misunderstanding are allowed to destroy.",5,"An Underrated, Bittersweet Comedic Drama With Russell Crowe",1048809600,"03 28, 2003",2003,2782,"['Years', 'before', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', '2000', 'film', 'Gladiator', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', '2001', 'film', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'starred', 'lesser-known', '1994', 'Australian', 'film', 'Sum', 'Us', 'Adapted', 'David', 'Stevens', 'own', 'off-Broadway', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Sum', 'Us', 'story', 'widowed', 'father', 'Harry', 'Mitchell', 'Harry', 'Thompson', 'who', 'played', '1980', 'film', 'Breaker', 'Morant', '2002', 'film', 'Star', 'Wars', 'II', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'rugby-playing', '24-year-old', 'gay', 'son', 'Jeff', 'Mitchell', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'two', 'maintain', 'strong', 'father-son', 'bond', 'searching', 'find', 'companionship', 'happiness', 'continuing', 'contend', 'death', 'Jeff', 'mother', 'Harry', 'who', 'ferryboat', 'captain', 'much', 'cooking', 'housework', 'Jeff', 'completely', 'accepting', 'son', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Jeff', 'who', 'plumber', 'father', 'house', 'share', 'struggling', 'find', 'descent', 'men', 'date.One', 'night', 'Jeff', 'someone', 'Greg', 'John', 'Polson', 'home', 'date', 'Harry', 'enthusiasm', 'Jeff', 'actually', 'having', 'date', 'benevolently', 'intrude', 'time', 'together', 'Harry', 'finally', 'Jeff', 'Greg', 'begin', 'share', 'intimacy', 'final', 'interruption', 'well-meaning', 'Harry', 'date', 'prematurely', 'Greg', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'open', 'sexuality', 'own', 'parents', 'uncomfortable', 'unaccustomed', 'accepting', 'environment', 'Mitchell', 'home', 'Harry', 'who', 'also', 'efforts', 'find', 'love', 'divorc', 'eacute', 'Joyce', 'Johnson', 'Deborah', 'Kennedy', 'strong', 'romance', 'develops', 'when', 'Joyce', 'inadvertently', 'Jeff', 'gay', 'Harry', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'Harry', 'severe', 'stroke', 'mostly', 'paralyzed', 'unable', 'speak', 'Jeff', 'care', 'Jeff', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'Greg', 'life', 'also', 'changed.Sadly', 'Sum', 'Us', 'received', 'little', 'attention', 'U.S.', 'following', 'release', 'Oscar', 'recognition', 'did', 'win', 'Australian', 'Film', 'Institute', 'AFI', 'award', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'AFI', 'Best', 'Film', 'Best', 'Editing', 'Best', 'Sound', 'John', 'Polson', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'was', 'Deborah', 'Kennedy', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Overall', 'rate', 'Sum', 'Us', '5', '5', 'stars', 'applaud', 'writer', 'David', 'Stevens', 'co-directors', 'Geoff', 'Burton', 'Kevin', 'Dowling', 'portrayal', 'affirmative', 'relationship', 'father', 'gay', 'son', 'bittersweet', 'comedic', 'drama', 'film', 'positive', 'message', 'audience', 'regarding', 'tolerance', 'acceptance', 'simultaneously', 'showing', 'pain', 'endured', 'when', 'intolerance', 'misunderstanding', 'are', 'allowed', 'destroy']",The Sum of Us VHS

It looks at loneliness from a gay and a heterosexual point of view, but not from the same person. It will become clear once you see the it. The actors are Australian so you must get used to their slang as well as their accents. Quite charming, actually.  This was done very tastefully, noexposed body parts. The rapore between Crowe and Thompson as father and son is a beautiful example of natural unselfish love and respect that all families should experience. From time to time the actors talk to the audience through the camera and it works well. Crowe shows he can play any type of character very well due to his dedication to his craft.
