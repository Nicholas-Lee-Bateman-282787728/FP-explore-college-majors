1440054,A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7,B0053O8A78,C. L. Messina,"[9, 12]","First, the positive. Baldwin was OUTSTANDING in the live episode and the Hazel character is a very good fit/counter with most characters. Throughout the season, Baldwin has been the most consistently funny even though you can tell he's working with very difficult material at times.Now, the bad. I've seen every episode of every season and like most up until season 6. There are big changes that have changed the character and quality of the show.First, there are too many jokes. I know that sounds counter to the goal of a comedy show but we're getting quantity over quality. Good jokes aren't given time to breathe and comedic timing has been off with many of the actors stepping over one another's lines. It's as though the actors are more concerned with plowing through a string of jokes than reacting to jokes and allowing the lines to be heard and sink in.Second, there is too much focus on trivial characters. I like Lutz as a punching bag but a whole episode dedicated to making him feel like part of a group?Third, too much catharsis. It seems this season saw a lot of stories trying to wrap up by the end of the episode with some big character change that was completely unnecessary. It felt forced.Four, too much suspension of disbelief. The writers have fallen back on stereotypes rather than good story lines about flawed but real humans. Several absurd things happen and rather than react in disbelief the characters become a part of it to the point of not being human. Every character is guilty of that this season but the biggest offenders are Tracy and Jenna. Even a fool has some level of sensibility. When the writers sacrifice or not consider that for the sake of scripted jokes then the character's contribution fails because we don't expect anything normal to balance the abnormal with. What would be so funny about Tracy Jordan walking around with a fish in his ear? Nothing because we expect him to do it.It seems as if all thought process that would make a character believable has been completely thrown out to focus on the stereotype instead. For example, we all know Kenneth is a 'dumb hick', but his biggest moments in the past were where in spite of this he seemed to gain the upper hand. Here the joke 'Kenneth is a dumb hick' is the only punchline and it is made repeatedly. I liken this to the last season of Seinfeld where absurdism reigned over reality (i.e. would Kramer REALLY have had a TV show set in his living room and would his friends REALLY just go along with it?).Five, too much political agenda. I felt like I could hear special interest groups saying, 'don't forget to include a nice little positive thing about us... for laughs.' Stories seemed to suffer for something entirely unnecessary to the comedy.I am a fan of the show. As I said, I've seen every episode and love the show up until this season. I know this cast is capable of very funny work but bad writing isn't going to get them anywhere. The writers need to step back, put these characters back on Earth, stop worrying about fan expectations (i.e. 'get Jack and Liz together', 'Be nice to Lutz', 'Say something funny about our special group') and stop relying on character stereotypes as the sole source of humor. If you can't do that then perhaps it is time to pull the plug.",1,Out of Steam or Bad Writing?,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,3286,"['First', 'positive', 'Baldwin', 'was', 'OUTSTANDING', 'live', 'episode', 'Hazel', 'character', 'very', 'good', 'fit/counter', 'most', 'characters', 'season', 'Baldwin', 'been', 'most', 'consistently', 'funny', 'even', 'can', 'tell', 'working', 'very', 'difficult', 'material', 'times.Now', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'season', 'most', 'up', 'season', '6', 'are', 'big', 'changes', 'have', 'changed', 'character', 'quality', 'show.First', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'jokes', 'know', 'counter', 'goal', 'comedy', 'show', ""'re"", 'getting', 'quantity', 'quality', 'Good', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'time', 'breathe', 'comedic', 'timing', 'been', 'off', 'many', 'actors', 'stepping', 'one', 'lines', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'plowing', 'string', 'jokes', 'reacting', 'jokes', 'allowing', 'lines', 'be', 'heard', 'sink', 'in.Second', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'trivial', 'characters', 'like', 'Lutz', 'punching', 'bag', 'whole', 'episode', 'dedicated', 'making', 'feel', 'part', 'group', 'Third', 'too', 'much', 'catharsis', 'season', 'saw', 'lot', 'stories', 'trying', 'wrap', 'up', 'end', 'episode', 'big', 'character', 'change', 'was', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'felt', 'forced.Four', 'too', 'much', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'writers', 'have', 'fallen', 'back', 'stereotypes', 'rather', 'good', 'story', 'lines', 'flawed', 'real', 'humans', 'Several', 'absurd', 'things', 'happen', 'rather', 'react', 'disbelief', 'characters', 'become', 'part', 'point', 'not', 'being', 'human', 'character', 'guilty', 'season', 'biggest', 'offenders', 'are', 'Tracy', 'Jenna', 'Even', 'fool', 'level', 'sensibility', 'When', 'writers', 'sacrifice', 'not', 'consider', 'sake', 'scripted', 'jokes', 'then', 'character', 'contribution', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'normal', 'balance', 'abnormal', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'funny', 'Tracy', 'Jordan', 'walking', 'around', 'fish', 'ear', 'Nothing', 'expect', 'do', 'it.It', 'thought', 'process', 'would', 'make', 'character', 'believable', 'been', 'completely', 'thrown', 'out', 'focus', 'stereotype', 'instead', 'example', 'know', 'Kenneth', ""'dumb"", 'hick', 'biggest', 'moments', 'past', 'were', 'where', 'spite', 'seemed', 'gain', 'upper', 'hand', 'Here', 'joke', ""'Kenneth"", 'dumb', 'hick', 'only', 'punchline', 'made', 'repeatedly', 'liken', 'last', 'season', 'Seinfeld', 'where', 'absurdism', 'reigned', 'reality', 'i.e', 'would', 'Kramer', 'REALLY', 'have', 'had', 'TV', 'show', 'set', 'living', 'room', 'would', 'friends', 'REALLY', 'just', 'go', 'along', '.Five', 'too', 'much', 'political', 'agenda', 'felt', 'could', 'hear', 'special', 'interest', 'groups', 'saying', ""'do"", ""n't"", 'forget', 'include', 'nice', 'little', 'positive', 'thing', 'laughs', 'Stories', 'seemed', 'suffer', 'something', 'entirely', 'unnecessary', 'comedy.I', 'am', 'fan', 'show', 'said', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'love', 'show', 'up', 'season', 'know', 'cast', 'capable', 'very', 'funny', 'work', 'bad', 'writing', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'anywhere', 'writers', 'need', 'step', 'back', 'put', 'characters', 'back', 'Earth', 'stop', 'worrying', 'fan', 'expectations', 'i.e', ""'get"", 'Jack', 'Liz', 'together', 'nice', 'Lutz', 'something', 'funny', 'special', 'group', 'stop', 'relying', 'character', 'stereotypes', 'sole', 'source', 'humor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'then', 'perhaps', 'time', 'pull', 'plug']",30 Rock: Season 6
