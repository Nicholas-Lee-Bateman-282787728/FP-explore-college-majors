And if our times are difficult and perplexing, so are they challenging and filled with opportunity.""  Robert Kennedy said this nearly five decades ago and it is just as relevant today.  The quality of leadership he portrayed was seeing problems as opportunities to correct the evils of the world.  He was courageous.  He did not have to pursue the causes of civil and human rights, of correcting century old wrongs in society.  This movie portrays him well and brings out his ideals and ideas.  I use it in my course on leadership since it exhibits so many qualities we need today and referenced it in  my latest book, Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times.It explores historic leadership qualities and challenges. It delves into the lives of Julius Caesar, Augustus, Napoleon, Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher and Oprah Winfrey to reveal their Leadership Secrets, Leadership Traits, Achievements, and Words of Wisdom to create a modern day compass for leaders of all ages, all industries and fields and all forms of leadership.My next book will also explore the qualities of JFK and RFK.

The film implies to a good extent that Bobby did in fact feel responsible for his brother's death, and the spirit of JFK tells Bobby that.I like the views from the spirit of JFK, who only Bobby can see, because it makes Bobby that much more human.  He wanted to do good things, he really did. He sought another view, possibly putting an end to the war in Vietnam, he sought to help out poor people, minorities, and fought for values more than for votes.Bobby really turned over a leaf from attack dog as Attorney General to a really good man who wanted to do good things, but a bullet ended that dream.  The ending speech and the train ride footage ends the movie perfectly cause it feels like a metaphor for the life of Bobby Kennedy.

Whether it was minorities, the poor, students or some other group, the 'new' Bobby was sincerely committed to ensuring everybody could (and did) participate in the American dream.What makes this transformation all the more magical is that a campaign consultant did not make the suggestion (and given how little some of these groups could financially contribute while their association simmutaeneously could have caused big political stigmatization, perhaps attempted to talk him out of these very same actions). It is to RFK's credit that he ultimately stood his own ground and took the road much less traveled in American politics.Because I came of age in the post-watergate generation, I am accustomed to candidates (regardless of political ideology and/or party) appearing replete with slick demeanor's. The rattling of RFK's psyche following Dallas 1963 ultimately produced a folksy demeanor that even Jimmy Carter ultimately had failed to replicate during his presidential candidate and presidency.If his own fate were different, Kennedy easily would have become the 20th century's second most influential president---immediately after fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt.",5,The political thriller to end all political thrillers,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,1533,"['screenplay', 'see', 'man', 'so', 'haunted', 'presumably', 'preventable', 'spectere', 'older', 'brother', 'death', 'litterally', 'whole', 'new', 'person', 'aftermath.The', 'young', 'communist', 'inquisitor', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'friends', 'Wisconsin', 'Republican', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'JFK', 'consequently', 'became', 'devout', 'champion', 'underclass', 'was', 'minorities', 'poor', 'students', 'other', 'group', ""'new"", 'Bobby', 'was', 'sincerely', 'committed', 'ensuring', 'everybody', 'could', 'did', 'participate', 'American', 'dream.What', 'transformation', 'more', 'magical', 'campaign', 'consultant', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'suggestion', 'given', 'how', 'little', 'groups', 'could', 'financially', 'contribute', 'association', 'simmutaeneously', 'could', 'have', 'caused', 'big', 'political', 'stigmatization', 'perhaps', 'attempted', 'talk', 'very', 'same', 'actions', 'RFK', 'credit', 'ultimately', 'stood', 'own', 'ground', 'took', 'road', 'much', 'less', 'traveled', 'American', 'politics.Because', 'came', 'age', 'post-watergate', 'generation', 'am', 'accustomed', 'candidates', 'regardless', 'political', 'ideology', 'party', 'appearing', 'replete', 'slick', 'demeanor', 'rattling', 'RFK', 'psyche', 'following', 'Dallas', '1963', 'ultimately', 'produced', 'folksy', 'demeanor', 'even', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'ultimately', 'had', 'failed', 'replicate', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'presidency.If', 'own', 'fate', 'were', 'different', 'Kennedy', 'easily', 'would', 'have', 'become', '20th', 'century', 'second', 'most', 'influential', 'president', '-immediately', 'fellow', 'Democrat', 'Franklin', 'Delano', 'Roosevelt']",RFK

747728,AK61LQI92GTCH,B00008W2OX,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[14, 16]","With an admiration bordering on reverence, RFK is a made-for-television movie that tracks Robert Kennedy's career from November, 1963 to his own death by assassination in June, 1968.  British actor Linus Roache plays Robert F. Kennedy and James Cromwell plays RFK nemesis and, coincidentally President of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson.Roache has the hair, the accent, and enough of the charisma to make a convincing RFK.  Missing is the sense of the spiritual growth RFK underwent in the five years following his brother's assassination.  It's mentioned, of course.  At one point Kennedy, after recounting some incidents in his ruthless past, asks an aide ""Do you really think I've changed?""  Unfortunately, the aide's affirmation stands in stead of the movie showing us the change.  Rather, writer Hank Steinberg and director Robert Dornhelm insert the shade of John F. Kennedy (Martin Donovan) into the story, and make him a character who pops in and out throughout the movie to chide, goad, and advise his younger brother.  It's a device the story doesn't need.  The facts were rich enough in themselves, and the JFK ghost just distracts and pulls us out of the story as well as cause us to question RFK's sanity.  Still, from carpeting-bagging senatorial candidate to spearheading a program to rebuild slum neighborhoods in New York City, from meeting with union activist Cesar Chavez to addressing an anti-apartheid crowd in South Africa to a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on an anti-war platform, RFK does hit most of the major points of Kennedy's career post 1963.RFK is an okay if somewhat spotty and superficial political biopic.  Towards the end of his life Robert Kennedy had indeed changed, and his growth from ruthless detachment to compassionate liberalism is one of the strangest political odysseys in American political history.

I thought the movie was so bad, I could not finish.The writers have chosen to rewrite history in many ways.  First, RFK apparently had schizophrenia because his reality was very distorted.  JFK kept appearing to RFK throughout the movie.  The most interesting thing is that RFK only speaks in a Massachusetts accent to his brother (or brother's illusion). As if distorting reality is not enough of a crime, the movie accuses Lyndon Johnson and the CIA of killing John Kennedy.Read a book on this fallen Catholic leader.

The movie is concerned with Bobby Kennedy's evolution after his brother's death in 1963, and Linus Roache does a convincing job of playing the late man (He and the actor who played RFK in Thirteen Days are the two best I've seen at this difficult acting job). Being something of a RFK buff, I found this film moving and worth watching. In this time of politicians who cater to the lowest common denominator (on both sides of the aisle), we need to look back on men like Bobby Kennedy, who genuinely cared about the underdogs of American society and was killed in the midst of his greatest act of compassion. One of these days, people will recognize RFK as the best man who was never elected President. This movie is a good start for anyone wondering &quot;what all the fuss was about&quot;.
