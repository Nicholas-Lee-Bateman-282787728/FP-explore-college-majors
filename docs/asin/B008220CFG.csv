1543736,A313R81OURQLM1,B008220CFG,Aaron Dean,"[0, 2]","Time seems to move at a glacial pace in Hollywood.  Somewhere, it's still shortly after ""The Ring"" was released, where that ""spooky little girl"" thing is still happening.  And somewhere, someone is trying to remind neglectful parents (lest they forget ""The Exorcist"") that their children just might get possessed and turn on them.  Such is the alternate timeline where this film came from.  It's a mind-bogglingly crazy take on the internet-born legend of the Dibbuk Box.  The true story in itself (which they go into scant detail on in the special features) is actually pretty spooky.  This film, however, is a joke.  If you've seen one sweaty little girl writhing and growling in man-voice you've seen them all.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick play the befuddled and neglectful parents who never ONCE earn our sympathies as the girl writhes around, eats raw steak on all-fours in the kitchen late at night, and vomits moths all over her sister.  It's just too much to take and not for a moment is it believable.  It also contains yet another example of the ""Let's sap all the color from every frame since it's horror"" style of film-making, a confounding trend that makes every shot look like it was filmed through a cup of fog.Skip it.  There is one and ONLY one Exorcism movie worth seeing and that particular lightning in the bottle will never again be recaptured.For some real scares, check out the REAL story of the Dibbuk Box which I will not link to here.

I guess it's really Jeffrey Dean Morgan, a ""poor man's"" Bardem, although Mr. Morgan is pretty good here, at least with what he has to work with.Why is it that nowadays, most male leads in film have to be these overly sensitive whimps?  It's actually getting a little irritating and distracting.  And this trend continues here with Mr. Morgan's character.  Yeah, he's strong I suppose when he needs to be, but for the most part, he just lays down and allows the rest of the cast -- mostly female -- to dominate the story.  I'm sure that this is the way that the director wanted it, perhaps to pull in more of a female audience, but that doesn't mean that I had to like it.  Where's Javier when we need him, the guy in ""No Country for Old Men""?  Now THAT was a strong male character.  OK, you're right; perhaps he was a little too strong.But besides this major complaint, this film is actually pretty decent.  The possession scenes are actually pretty scary, and I jumped a few times when I expected members of the family to get whacked.  And I really liked the idea that the exorcist character was Jewish.  After all, Satan is an equal-opportunity destroyer.  Why do the Christians get to have all the fun?What's the theme of the movie?  Well, I'm not exactly sure.

I was expecting an over-the-top gore fest and violence-filled scream queen type of a flick.  But it turned out to be a well-acted, well-made horror movie.  Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan head the capable cast.  But it's young Natasha Calis that gave the standout performance in the movie.  This is Natasha's movie, and it could very well propel her to stardom.Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a collegiate basketball coach, and a recently-divorced father of two young girls.  As the story begins, he is trying to pick up the pieces and start a new life in his new home.  At the same time, he is also facing a career decision when he learns of a possible job opportunity to coach North Carolina.  He is currently sharing custody of the girls with his ex-wife.  One afternoon, while driving through a residential neighborhood, the girls sees a yard sale.  Needing items for his new house, the coach agrees to stop and let the girls pick out items that he might need in his new home.  The younger girl, Emily, sees an unusual wooden box.  They purchase this box, along with dishes and utensils for the house.Emily becomes increasingly fascinated with the box.  Eventually, she manages to get it open.  From that point on, strange things begin to happen.  Swarms of insects start appearing in her room.  Her behavior starts to change.  Understandably, the adults assumed it was just a minor issue related to their separation.  But the problem continues and Emily's behavior becomes more violent.  The box is a prison for a malicious spirit called a dybbuk.  In jewish mythology, this spirit is evil and likes to possess the body of the living.  By opening the box, Emily has released the dybbuk from its prison.The story was inspired by the events surrounding a wooden box that was auctioned off on eBay nearly ten years ago.  This box, referred to as the Dybbuk Box, was handed down the family line of a holocaust survivor.  Every one who has owned the box have made claims that strange things began to happen in their lives during their time of ownership.  In any case, several possible explanations have been given for these events.  And should you ever come across a wooden box with the Shema carved into it on eBay, I would suggest that you pass it up.  :)Anyway, regardless of whether you believe or do not believe that these events were caused by the box, this is still a very good movie.

1543762,A2MC8ATJJBIP7T,B008220CFG,CJCS Mom,"[1, 1]","Inspired by LA Times writer Leslie Gornstein's article ""A Jinx in a Box,"" this horror film from Ghost House Pictures  tells the tale of a broken family that comes under attack from a malevolent supernatural entity of Jewish folklore. Shortly after her parents (Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick) divorce, a young girl purchases an ornate antique box at a yard sale. In the weeks that follow, the young girl forms an intense fixation on the box, her behavior growing increasingly bizarre as she falls into the grip of a diabolical apparition. When the girl's father discovers that the relic is in fact a holding cell for the disconnected soul of a deceased person who has been denied entry into the afterlife and needs a human host to inhabit, he fights to rid her of the evil that threatens to consume her body and soul.I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot better than I expected. I thought Jeffrey Dean Morgan did a excellent job and Natasha Calis was wonderful as Em, the daughter who becomes obsessed with the box. It's not your typical ghost story and I think because Sam Raimi was one of the producers, people expected it to be really, really scary and while it was scary, it doesn't have a lot of blood and gore. It reminds me of Drag Me to Hell, which was another Sam Raimi movie that wasn't really bloody or gory but yet it was scary and really good as well.

1543779,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B008220CFG,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 1]","---------------------------------------------------------------""The Possession""(Lionsgate, 2013)---------------------------------------------------------------Note: spoilers below. Don't freak out.---------------------------------------------------------------This demon-possession/exorcism movie follows a conventional -- and pleasantly old-school -- narrative, with the glum young daughter of recently-divorced parents coming into ownership of a creepy wooden box which, when opened, unleashes an evil spirit that warps and ultimately consumes her. The twist, such as it is, is that this spirit isn't your run-of-the-mill Catholic-theology, Satan-affiliated demon, but rather a dybbuk, a demonic damned soul from the Jewish tradition, which pretty much acts the same way as all the other demons in movies such as ""The Exorcist,"" and ""Omen,"" but needs a Jewish cleric to expel it from its host, preferably a Hasidic rabbi with long payot and a preference for dark clothing. The film is anchored by an excellent actor, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (perhaps best known as the dying/ghost boyfriend, Denny Duquette, on TV's Grey's Anatomy) -- as the family dad here, his reactions are realistic and proportional, with Morgan doing his best with the role. Even more noteworthy are the two young actresses who play his daughters, Natasha Calis and Madison Davenport, who both deliver impressive and understated performances: I'd keep an eye on both of these kids to see where their careers go from here.This is a pretty average demon movie, admirable for its slow pace and conscious throwback to an earlier era of psychological tension and suspense, as opposed to gratuitous gore and voluminous special effects -- this is Amityville/Omen/Shining stuff, not Freddy and his splattercore spawn. There was room for improvement -- for example, the creepy, battered old box could have looked less overtly creepy, since it doesn't make much sense that a ten-year old girly girl would have wanted it in the first place, or that her dad would have bought it for her, no matter how much he was into buying his kids whatever they wanted in order to seem like the best divorced dad ever, but whatever. It's a creepy magic box that seduces its victims, and that's that. The Jewish angle is okay, although clearly there's a Holocaust backstory waiting for a sequel (it's not in this film, but you know it's coming). While the film largely avoids overt stereotypes, the portrayal of its Jewish characters is a little eye-rolly: a secular academic that the dad goes to talks cryptically in a funny cadence, and the somber Hasidic cabal that he's sent to are otherworldly and exotic, though perhaps no more so than the shifty Catholic priests in ""The Da Vinci Code.""

In fact, don't waste your time even if you can see if for free.Husband is separated from wife. Husband gets weekend with children where the younger daughter spots a box her daddy buys for her at a yard sale. There is an ominous warning from a bandaged person in the window beyond who watches the purchase. The girl figures a way to open the box, and soon there is a voice that starts talking to the girl, who in turn, starts acting strangely. Daddy doesn't understand and mommy thinks daddy is abusing their little girl. In desperation, daddy takes the box, which incidentally had Hebraic writing carved in it, and takes it to the Hassidim Community in Brooklyn for answers and solutions.Taking it into a temple, the other religious men in their shtreimel and rekels gasp and step back as if Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is daddy, has just released the Bubonic Plague. The grand rebbi says he cannot help him. He pronounces it an evil box used to constrain some evil spirit that was evil in humanhood, and it will kill his daughter. But the son waiting outside says it is his obligation as a Jew to help, and the two drive back upstate to get the evil spirit that is taking over daddy's little girl. A Jewish exorcism begins.With daughter sounding odd, rolling eyeballs, levitating, snd smacking mom and dad around a room in the basement of a hospital where the lights go on and off like some kind of light show at Studio 54, our Hassidic hero in shawl and yalmulka is bowing repeatedly saying some kind of exorcism ritual to take that evil soul out of the man's daughter.

1543783,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B008220CFG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","THE POSSESSION (Dir. Ole Bornedal, 2012, 90 minutes) is pretty simple to describe: it isThe Exorcistin a Jewish context. A basketball coach buys a strange, old wooden box for his younger daughter at a yard sale, a box with Hebrew carved all over it. Soon his daughter becomes entranced by it and is completely attached to it - or it attaches itself to her if you will. You see, it contains locked within it a ""demon"", better known in Hebrew as a dybbukin though it is erroneously called a ""dybbuk"".This was an artistically impressive, very well shot film. Its artful though suspenseful approach to the demonic, to possession and exorcism may look a bit refreshing, but do not be misled. It is cable TV crap, albeit with a Jewish twist. When the family finally comes to terms with the fact that they need a REAL Jew to perform an exorcism, the thing becomes incredibly silly. Artistically speaking, I was impressed by the fantasy-driven Jewish exorcism ritual depicted in this film, don't get me wrong.After all, the movies are the movies. But I think something better could have been done. The acting here is quite spectacular, though I noticed a few lapses that made no sense - perhaps nothing more than the usual sub-par writing/acting that accidentally gets woven into most films. On the upside - and here Raimi shows his hand in this - I love the get-it-done shooting then fade to two seconds of black before moving on with the action. It's a style I love and few can film that way properly.What chiefly bothered me is the boast at the beginning of the film, that this is based on a true story about what happened to a family over a period of 29 days. I am conversant with the somewhat dubious story of the so-called ""dybbuk box"" and this film bears no resemblance to that ridiculous story at all except for the box and its Jewish origins. Oh, and there is, as in the film, something in the alleged true story about someone's hair falling out - but then we Jews have that curse anyway!As for a dybbukin, that is, according to Jewish teaching, the spirit of someone who has something very important to do. Evil or not, in the worst case scenario it seeks to possess someone in order to execute what it feels it must do. As for the ""Jewish exorcism"", this film portrays the internet as having all-you-need-to-know from footage to ""Jewish how-to-do-it-yourself"" exorcism guides. The girl's father studies all this carefully, which is what leads him to the Hasid who performs the ritual.That is patently stupid and untrue in the extreme. There is no such Jewish exhibitionsim online because it does not exist. Whatever you see is probably a bunch of dorks disguised as Hasidic Jews pretending to do exorcisms. There is no Jewish DIY-guide, as depicted in the film. What kind of product placement is that supposed to be, I ask you?!In fact the young actress who played the possessed daughter reminded me of the vampire girl (Chloe Grace Moritz) inLet Me In. What I mean is, once 'transformed', you realize that instead of an innocent little girl you actually have a slightly-too-sexy, very athletic young lady there.As to that sequence, I was reminded unpleasantly of the weird Hasidic Kabalists from the moviePi(see my review). I'm tired of my people being treated with this level of cavalier disrespect in the movies. However, I can appreciate at the very least they tried to show demonic possession from a Jewish standpoint, no matter how wonky. Nice try, fellas. It deserves an A for effort because no one has done a demonic possession movie from the Jewish standpoint.Maybe because it just really does not exist in the real-life Jewish religion.The film is entertaining enough, spooky enough and just about gross enough for anyone having a taste for this sort of thing. I noticed a few 'homage shots' and other details evokingThe Exorcist. Well done enough so that it did not really anger me. Some films cannot reach this level of artistry - this has ""Sam Raimi"" written all over it like the dybbukin box has Hebrew - but in the end I really could have done without it.Demonic possession is in the eyes of the beholder. I leave it to your eyes.With the marvelous talents of an impressive Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Kyra Sedgwick, Natasha Calis, Madison Davenport, and the highly bizarre Matisyahu (ne Matthew Miller, the Jewish singer) as Tzaddik (credited as ""Tzadok""), the brave rebbe's son who performs the ritual. For your reference, a ""tzaddik"" is Hebrew for a learned holy man.Since I noticed some interest I just had to add this for anyone who remotely cares: Jewish ""exorcism"" simply does not exist as you all would like it. But if you want something official from the Jewish religion, I have two stories for you:1) In ancient times there was a rabbi who exorcised a water demon (he only chased it out of a river) then got it to do his bidding, forcing it to do good deeds.2) The great and marvelous Rabbi Akiva, for whom I am named, strolled past a graveyard and saw a ... well, demonic-type of something. He concluded it was a soul who had no one to pray for it, so he composed the Jewish ""Kaddish"" on the spot, thereby exorcizing this whatever it was. So there you go.Shame on you armchair theologians who think you can just stroll out and find a JEWISH exorcism pamphlet! Wrong religion, people!!",3,"What you get when you mix The Exorcist, Sam Raimi and the Jews",1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,5306,"['POSSESSION', 'Dir', 'Ole', 'Bornedal', '2012', '90', 'minutes',

1543784,AYG1U47VFZ165,B008220CFG,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[28, 36]","There's been a rash of exorcism-style films these last few years.  Some of them have been good, and, naturally, some of them have been bad.  It could be that this trend is little more than an industry going through its creativity cycle, rediscovering some of what produces more authentic scares from yesteryear - that being stories grounded in reality - for audiences who've grown accustomed to and thus dismissive of more special-effects-heavy gore.  I tend to believe that there's something a bit different going on; I think that we - as a society - tend to reach out for a renewal of these spirits-inhabiting-another tales when we're going through some cultural upheavals.  Instead of accepting that Tinseltown drives us, I prefer to think that we tap find these special places all on our own.  Then, some clever scriptwriters trap lightning in a bottle, and viola!  That same ol' exorcism is now back in vogue!(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to my last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Clyde Brenek (played by the reliable Jeffrey Dean Morgan) recently separated from his wife, Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick).  When their youngest daughter, Emily (Natasha Calis), begins displaying some weirdly erratic behaviors, they and her school are quick to chalk it all up to the inevitable side effect of a marriage in collapse.  However, the girl's creeping obsession with an ornate, antique wooden box she picked up from a yard sale borders on the insane.  As Clyde begins to research more about the item, he realizes he has something very tragic and very unique in his possession: it's known as a Dibbuk box.  It's meant to contain a dislocated spirit.  To his dismay, Em has opened the box, and now the entity is slowly devouring her soul.Director Ole Bornedal manages to squeeze a bit more life out of the traditional exorcism picture by sticking with mostly classical film techniques - inexorably slow pans and eases and tricks with light and shadow - whereas a more contemporary director would've tried to likely incorporate some CGI sequences.  There's nothing big and bold here.  This is traditional filmmaking, and it works.  By sticking with what's tried and true, Bornedal elevates the story to that of legitimacy, letting the script from Juliet Snowden and Stiles White effectively breathe in that atmosphere.Also, it doesn't hurt matters that the tale heavily straddles some common family issues - dad and mom are divorced, the kids are getting used to the separation, mom has another man in the picture whilst dad is considering relocating elsewhere for work - as these all tend to complement the dynamic of not only a family but also a greater society in flux.  That dynamic gives more credibility to an undercurrent that's unsettling, giving these characters some added depth.  It all adds up in creating an environment where a spectral entity could, perhaps, seek out and find residence amongst the weak, so it's clear that all players have done their homework in legitimizing the stresses.In fact, most of THE POSSESSION works precisely because it comes across as heavily grounded in real events.  (Indeed, the script is based on actual occurrences, though the accompanying documentary - a special feature - gives a much different accounting of events.)  The smart script never cheapens the relationships; the production team never resorts to flashy pyrotechnics to get across the frights; and what emerges is a welcome return to the good, old-fashioned, conventional ghost story.  There's evil out there, and it needs one of us in order to be free.  It's all made cohesive through the commitments of a solid cast and crew.THE POSSESSION (Rated PG-13) is produced by Ghost House Pictures and North Box Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.  As for the technical specs, the film looks and sounds remarkable; there are a few moments when I cranked up the center volume to hear some of the ghost's whispery dialogue, but, alas, there's nothing the audience needs to hear specifically.  The disc has two separate commentary tracks - the first is from Bornedal, and the second is from scriptwriters Snowden and White.  Furthermore, there's a brief documentary explored the truth behind the fiction, treating viewers to a look at the real Dibbuk Box.  Also, there's an assortment of trailers.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I didn't see how THE POSSESSION really brought anything all that new, novel, or unique to the `exorcism' genre, but there's something to be said for legitimate creepiness in the age of special effects.  Still, it's better than most films of this sort that have come along in quite some time.  There are some very solid moments grounding the picture between the players - Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Natasha Calis, especially - that elevate the story to another level.  Additionally, there's a lot of solid camera work that helps work up the tension to palpable levels, though some of the trickery falls predictably thin in the climax.  Worth its scares in gold, though.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE POSSESSION for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,THE POSSESSION Is A Visual Throwback To Scares That Don't Rely Heavily On CGI,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,5490,"['been', 'rash', 'exorcism-style', 'films',

1543789,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B008220CFG,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","""The Exorcist"" was a groundbreaking film. It wasn't just a fright fest. It had a strong socio-political subtext that gave it depth. Other than that, the only film involving possession to reach near the same level of quality is ""The Conjuring."" All others, and there are quite a few, pale by comparison. ""Possession"" is no exception.Here's the scoop. Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) are recently divorced. He's trying to get back on the fast track as a basketball coach and she's starting up a business. Their two young girls are coping well enough with the situation. Dad takes them garage sale hunting where the younger daughter finds an antique box. She brings it to dad's new home and, little by little, she comes under the spell of said box. Now mom and dad need to get her released.This is kind of a sucky movie. I kept seeing things that I'd seen before. As in Spielberg's ""Poltergeist"" he situates dad's new house in a new subdivision. As in ""The Exorcist"" you're dealing with a broken family. As a matter of fact there were a few elements taken from ""The Exorcist."" But this is just a sketch of a movie. There is little here with any resonance or lasting quality. There were a few good scares and a few good scenes. I like Jeffrey Dean Morgan and he's decent enough here. I like Kyra Sedgwick but her part is poorly written. I suppose the big surprise was seeing Yiddish rapper Matisyahu as the Jewish exorcist. It was shot well enough. The sound mixing was suspect and the directing was uneven. I've seen director Ole Bornedal's ""I Am Dina"" which I liked quite a bit. But he also directed ""Nightwatch"" which I hated more than I can say.Audiences love a good, scary movie. They love being scared without an actual threat, but chances are, unless you're young, or new to the genre, there won't be much to raise the hairs on your arms here.",3,"Vest Pocket ""Exorcist""",1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1872,"['Exorcist', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'fright', 'fest', 'had', 'strong', 'socio-political', 'subtext', 'gave', 'depth', 'Other', 'only', 'film', 'involving', 'possession', 'reach', 'same', 'level', 'quality', 'Conjuring', 'others', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Possession', 'scoop', 'Clyde', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'Stephanie', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'are', 'recently', 'divorced', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'fast', 'track', 'basketball', 'coach', 'starting', 'up', 'business', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'coping', 'well', 'enough', 'situation', 'Dad', 'garage', 'sale', 'hunting', 'where', 'younger', 'daughter', 'antique', 'box', 'dad', 'new', 'home', 'little', 'little', 'spell', 'said', 'box', 'Now', 'mom', 'dad', 'need', 'get', 'released.This', 'kind', 'sucky', 'movie', 'kept', 'seeing', 'things', ""'d"", 'seen', 'before', 'Spielberg', 'Poltergeist', 'dad', 'new', 'house', 'new', 'subdivision', 'Exorcist', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'broken', 'family', 'matter', 'fact', 'were', 'few', 'elements', 'taken', 'Exorcist', 'just', 'sketch', 'movie', 'little', 'here', 'resonance', 'lasting', 'quality', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'scares', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'like', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'decent', 'enough', 'here', 'like', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'part', 'poorly', 'written', 'suppose', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'seeing', 'Yiddish', 'rapper', 'Matisyahu', 'Jewish', 'exorcist', 'was', 'shot', 'well', 'enough', 'sound', 'mixing', 'was', 'suspect', 'directing', 'was', 'uneven', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'director', 'Ole', 'Bornedal', 'Am', 'Dina', 'liked', 'quite', 'bit', 'also', 'directed', 'Nightwatch', 'hated', 'more', 'can', 'say.Audiences', 'love', 'good', 'scary', 'movie', 'love', 'being', 'scared', 'actual', 'threat', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'young', 'new', 'genre', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'raise', 'hairs', 'arms', 'here']",N/A

Never in a million years did I anticipate it was possible to make a movie about demon possession and have it completely devoid of the utterance of the name of Jesus Christ or the symbolism of the cross. ""The Possession"" has accomplished both these tasks in the space of one film.To say this Jewish take on ""The Exorcist"" is unique would be both true and false at the same time. It's more of the same in the fact that it tramples the frequently treaded grounds explored by ""The Last Exorcism,"" ""The Devil Inside,"" ""The Rite,"" and countless others over the years. Where it's unique is in the fact that it explores the concept from the viewpoint of the Jewish faith instead of the usual Judeo-Christian one.In case you're not in the religious know, most Jews don't believe Jesus is the Son of God. Therefore, there's no name of Jesus or sign of the cross they can use to battle demonic forces. Although I don't share their beliefs, it's fascinating to explore the idea of possession and exorcism from a different angle.Clyde Brenek (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) takes his daughters to an estate sale on their way home one afternoon. The youngest one, Em (Natasha Calis), is captivated by an antique wooden box with bizarre writing on it. Clyde buys it for her and they take it home. Em becomes obsessed with the box, going as far as to sleep with it and take it to school with her.Clyde and ex-wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) become more and more concerned as Em's behavior becomes unpredictable and violent. Clyde takes the box to be examined and finds out that it is a container for an evil spirit known as a Dibbuk. Once the box is opened, it slowly and completely consumes the human it has bonded with. The two parents must get past their disbelief and find someone within the Jewish religious community who will step out in faith and help them.Director Ole Bornedal (""Nightwatch"") is no stranger to the art of creating a suspenseful atmosphere in his films. ""The Possession"" also shows that he knows how to take what many would consider tired subject matter and breathe new life into it. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the movie doesn't have any flaws, but for the most part it's genuinely creepy and provides some frightening visuals.I would recommend ""The Possession"" to those horror fans tired of the same old boring take on territory ""The Exorcist"" explored in 1973. Although my own beliefs are Christian, I found the Jewish take on the concept of possession to be fascinating to examine. There might be many ""d&eacute;j&agrave; vu"" moments, but it's light years better than other exorcism movies we've been bombarded with recently.

Then of course there is the obvious reason which is that it is an exorcism movie. That is two reason and good enough reasons for me to this. So when I eventually got around to checking it out I have to say that I was pleased with my viewing experience.A divorced couple is trying hard to get along and do right by their daughters, sharing custody. The father takes his daughters one day and happens upon a yard sell; the owners of the house may or may not have just been involved in something dark. While there the youngest comes across a box that catches her fancy. Of course daddy wants to make her happy so he buys it for her. Everything is fine until they get to the new house that their father has gotten. That night things start to go bump in the night and strange things happen time after time. The youngest daughter seems to be the only one affected and it is driving the family even further apart. But she may be in serious danger as something dark and old may be lurking inside her newly found box.This film is based on a true story about a thing called the Dybbuk Box, which is a wine cabinet that supposedly houses an evil spirit. This is all based on Jewish legend which of course plays heavily in the film, refreshing new spin on the usually Catholic exorcism flick. I have heard of this before and a Dybbuk has been mention or used in films previous to this. Any way this movie is based on the box that was involved in the e-bay story. You should research this further if interested. I know that it has been the subject of a few TV shows including ""Paranormal Witness"" I believe.I have to say that director Ole Bornedal really knows what he is doing. The atmosphere that he creates in this film is great and may be the best thing about the film. Of course the writers deserve credit here as they adapted the story of what really happened into this film. There were some big changes if you watch the special features like the real story feature or listen to the 2 great commentaries. Also I loved the performances here but the show stealer was probably Natasha Callis, the youngest of the kids. She is wonderful here but so is everyone else if that wasn't clear from my previous sentence. Also I liked musician Matisyahu here, I actually had no idea he was in it until he popped up.This movie had some creepy moments in it but it was not over done which makes it a watchable film for younger viewers in my opinion. Also the DVD comes with those bonus features I mentioned earlier among others so it is a good purchase. I do recommend this film to any horror or exorcism movie fan. Maybe a night featuring this, ""The Innkeepers"", ""Sinister"", ""Mama"" and ""The Woman in black"" is in my near future.

In ""The Possession"", one scene is letting us see demonic fingers trying to climb the throat of the poor possessed girl! And one MRI from the hospital shows the demon's face roaming inside the girl's heart! There you go. Demons can physically live inside one's body. Not spiritually. Physically. Haven't seen that before, have you? I call it the ""Fright Night"" effect, in honor of the 1985 vampire flick in which you learned that crosses were only working if you had true faith.That is the only thing to remember from this film. For a serious student of screenplay writing, I mean. If you want to write a good horror film (especially those with demons in them), try to come up with a scene or a story device that we've never seen before. The danger, though, is that by trying too hard, you might end up making your audience laugh more than anything else.The rest of the film is just a series of clich&eacute;s, one after the other. You can also learn from that. Learn what-not-to-do when writing such a film. The spanish maid (or nurse) who knows stuff?  The chilly whispers? The bugs (or moths)as a metaphor for the devil? The possessed girl with long hair and a white gown? That same girl speaking in a scary voice? The white eyes? The exorcism scene where the demon yells? The bones breaking? The distorsioned body? The elders who knows the secret? Don't do those anymore. We've seen them a zillion times.And those are just your usual ghost-like clich&eacute;s. What about your basic Hollywood clich&eacute;s? The dad who promises he will be at his daughter's practice but you know he won't be there? That same dad who will be accused of being a bad dad only for every character to find at the end that he isn't? The mother and the father who are separated but will get back together at the end? I mean, one should come up with a list of what-not-to-do-that's-been-done-before prior to writing any film.By the way, if the parents are getting back together at the end, does this mean that the possession of their daughter was the... best thing (!) that could have happen to their couple?  Because you also have your illogic story devices that always come along such demonic films. Why would the Spanish maid or nurse, in the beginning, let a little child buy the box? Didn't the attack of the possessed girl on her mother wake the entire house? What did the doctors thought of the MRI of the little possessed girl's body in which we clearly see the demon inside?  How can the family go back to a normal life after all this?Again, for want of anything better, at least you can use such a film as an academic tool for screenplay writing 101. When writing a film, make a list of everything we've seen a zillion times before and... don't do them again! Oh and don't forget the ""Fright Night"" effect. Crosses only work when you have faith. Now you go on and try to beat that one...",1,Good!

In many places, I actually found it dull.So why the three stars then?Because one thing I *did* like was that this wasn't the same exorcism movie we've seen remade constantly since the success of the biggie in the seventies. This possession is different. It comes from the canon of a different religion, and it's brought about for different reasons from the ones we're used to seeing. As such, while it didn't entertain me per se, it *did* interest me. In fact, I found myself checking out Wikipedia during the film just to read up on the subject matter.

I've read the story of the dibbuk box (it's easy to find online) and that would have made a fine, creepy movie that perhaps someone will make someday. What we're left with is the tale of a young girl who doesn't know how to act, who happens to own a old wooden box.If you've seen the trailers, you've likely seen the single scene in the entire movie that isn't a complete cliche - the girl, looking into the mirror, sees two fingers reaching up out of her throat. If you could somehow just focus on that image for two hours, you'll have had a more satisfying viewing experience than actually seeing the movie. Mostly, it's just a movie that desperately wants to be The Exorcist (seriously, there's even an MRI scene), but fails at even that, nevermind being a functional and enjoyable movie that can stand on its own.I'm being charitable giving even two stars, and it earns that second one just for casting Hasidic Jewish reggae artist Matisyahu as...well, a Hasidic Jewish exorcist.

1543823,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B008220CFG,John's Horror Corner,"[52, 64]","This was okay.  But Raimi fans will find no Drag Me to Hell gross-out gore and generally horror fans will not see original scenes (regarding scares), provocative possession behavior, or unique plot elements.  The newer you are to the genre (or, possession or demon box movies, per se) the more you will enjoy this finely prepared, but under-seasoned meal.  While perfectly competent for a horror, let's call it the ""Diet Coke"" of exorcism; a series of missed opportunities and pulled punches.Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick), Em[ily] (Natasha Calis) and her older sister are a family recently sundered by a rather civil divorce.  But when young Em becomes fond of an antique puzzle box she finds at a yard sale things start to get strange.  Em becomes temperamental, graduating to obsessive about the box while apathetic (even sociopathic) of the needs or wants of others.  Clyde begins to suspect a malevolent force is at work and seeks the aid of the Hasidic elders, from whom we learn about demons (or dibbuks), their specially crafted, imprisoning boxes, and exorcism.Most truly impressive was our young Natasha Calis as Em.  She did an amazing job showing us that as the demon commanded more and more of her conscious self (to the point of entirety) that underneath she was aware of her uncharacteristic, marionetted actions.  Her expressive eyes were the key.  Somehow malevolent on the possessed outside, while only thinly veiling the sadness and desperation of the scared child trapped within behind the evil veneer.  As her desperate and fearful father, Jeffrey Dean Morgan also does a spectacular job as the serial-recipient of her cold, lifeless gazes.  But all of this amazing tone contributed to only minor tension with no real follow-through.  The scares really weren't there for me--not even a bit, short of being taken off guard by blaring loud noises which, while a classic tactic, should come with a little more than just a lone, pounding instrumental note.  I feel like they pulled too many punches--or simply didn't have the muscle to throw them in the first place.  No exorcism should be devoid of offensive material, but this movie was completely inoffensive.  This is really like an Exorcist-lite movie; the ""Diet Coke"" of exorcism movies; a series of missed opportunities or, perhaps even, a Disney-appropriate version of The Exorcist.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however. That is, unless, you enjoy R-rated horror movies.  Some PG-13's pull it off--this one didn't.The only truly unique moment of the film was a brief scene of moths hurricaning around Em's bedroom.  Everything else has been done before--not that I'm suggesting it's easy to produce something you've never seen in a horror flick nowadays.  The exorcism scene in the end is stunningly similar, even copied, to that of The Unborn (2008), as is the general Jewish demon premise (with a few tweaks).To the seasoned viewer, this film might come off as at least a little bit boring when the filmmakers aren't trying to scare you with loud noises (and little clout to back them).  I kept feeling a bit of the Sam Raimi vibe, but just when I thought it would hit with something shocking, gastro-intestinally gross and gory, or totally twisted--it wouldn't happen!  Instead I just got dirty Ring-Grudge hands, a swarm zombie moths, whited-out ""possessed"" eyes, and a bunch of child-gone-wrong temper tantrums.  There were also some significant plot holes--not that that's a surprise in a horror film--which didn't even get a nod.  For example, something awful happens to Stephanie's boyfriend and he vanishes from the movie, then everyone behaves as if he was never there whereas earlier he was playing a father-replacement role much to Clyde's chagrin.  Then there was the fact that there was a horribly bandaged woman in the house where they bought the dibbuk box--ever think to go ask them about it before turning to obscure experts?  I saw the ending coming from a mile away but, as a serious horror fan, I still appreciated the oft-told ominous closing message.In the end this was a perfectly competent, well-acted horror film with a less common spin on a quite common story.  A little too light for my taste, but heavy-handed horror and sacrilegious scenarios are not for everyone.  If you are ""not everyone"" then maybe this very PG possession movie is for you.SIDBAR:  This movie is a slightly different take on The Unborn (2009), in which Odette Annabel/Yustman is plagued by her unborn Dibbuk demon twin--not The Unborn (1991), in which a woman has a mutant, murderous baby a la It's Alive (1974, 2008 remake).  On that note, let's just snuff out the fact that sooo many people are thrilled to see ""this new take"" on ""the first Jewish exorcism"" movie.  It's not.  It's at least the second and is basically a reboot with some scenes remade from The Unborn.  This movie is also in no way related to the ultra-weird and cerebral Possession (1981, with Sam Neil).BIPOLAR REVIEWS:  Hop on to IMDB as scan the already numerous reviews and you'll find that everyone is loving or loathing this flick.

It mainly follows Clyde, the father, and Emily, the younger daughter, after they purchase a haunted box and release a demon. The Possession is a creepy possession film.The story in The Possession is creepy and often unsettling; I'm a fan of possession films and haven't seen a great one in a long time, so this was a pleasant surprise. I like the approach of the film; it doesn't rely on bone-popping, excessive vulgar language, or heavy special effects. However, I wasn't a big fan of the storytelling. A lot of events in this film occur spontaneously, and end suddenly - no lead up or continuity; for example, the breakfast scene suddenly starts, then ends rapidly without much explanation before and after. This happens often, even the music starts to build up then suddenly cuts to the next scene. I liked this at first, but then it got a bit repetitive, especially since it used the same music. It has some scary moments, both with jump-scares and disturbing imagery, and it at least takes some time to develop a sweet father-daughter relationship. Although it is often somewhat disturbing, the film is very tamed and never shocking, this may be a plus or negative depending on your taste. The acting was great, I really liked Natasha Calis' performance. The music was also great and atmospheric, although repetitive.The Blu-ray of this film has excellent picture and sound quality. However, the Blu-Ray lacks special features as it only has some audio commentary and trailers.Overall, The Possession is a great possession film; not the best, but definitely better than recent attempts, like ""The Devil Inside"".

But it was entertaining and the story was captivating. It was more about intrigue than scares.Most horror movies that come out these days lack the element of story telling. In my opinion, the story is the most important factor in making a good horror film. I don't need a masked killer jumping out of nowhere wielding a machete, or guts getting ripped out to scare me. It's all been done over and over again for centuries and has become so commonplace now that it has just became a mockery.If a story is suspensful and tells a good story at the same time, which is pretty uncommon today, you then have a recipe for a quality horror film (or any genre of film for that matter), and that's what this movie did. And the story of the dibbuk box is fascinating and persuaded me to look further into the subject.I also was not expecting Matisyahu to be in it. Turns out he is a good actor.

So it was great to see a film show and explore possession from a non-Christian point of view. Natasha Calis was a true find as a child actress, a combination of Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther from Orphan and of Daveigh Chase and Samara from The Ring. A lot of adult actors could not effortlessly flow through the range of emotions she showed, from obsessive malevolence when she's either possessed or separated from her box to horror and fear over what she is becoming. Some of the visual imagery is striking as well, the moths everywhere, the creature showing up on the scan, but especially the fingers in the throat. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick are great as well, as a man who knows something is wrong with his daughter and will go to any lengths to find out what it is and help her, and a woman who initially believes it's just the stress of the broken marriage and possible abuse of Em by her father, then suddenly comes to the realization that whatever is happening to her little girl is not earthly. The only part of the film that sort of made me pull a bit of a facepalm was the ending, I'm getting more than a little sick of the well-worn clich&eacute; of divorced/separated couples who spend the entire film being fairly antagonistic towards each other, then suddenly rekindle their love through a shared crisis. We've seen it in Jurassic Park III, Twister, and several other films, it's worn out its welcome.

1543863,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008220CFG,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","For those who aren't familiar with the name Sam Raimi my guess is you are aware of the movies he's made. Lately he's been associated with the first Spider-man trilogy starring Tobey McGuire. But long before that Raimi was a director whose first major film of note was THE EVIL DEAD, still one of the scariest movies ever made. That being said I guess it's no wonder that Raimi got into the producing side of the business. The latest film to find him in that seat is THE POSSESSION and it's one of the scariest movies I've seen in some time.Jeffrey Dean Morgan stars as Clyde, a basketball coach recently divorced from his wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick). The couple has two pre-teen children, Hannah (Madison Davenport) is the older of the two and of course the standard troubled pre-teen. Em (Natasha Calls) is the younger of the pair and still has high hopes of her parents reuniting.  With a new man in her life that's highly unlikely.On a weekend when Clyde has the girls staying at his place they stop at a yard sale where Em's eye is attracted to what appears to be an antique box with some writings carved into it. Of course she's allowed to buy this and then takes it home. It seems like a puzzle box with no way of being opened, but eventually Em does get it open. And that's when things begin to happen.Small things at first like a single moth in a room. But that escalates when during the night a bunch of these moths show up in the bathroom while Hannah is there which leads them to Em's room which is filled to the brim with them. A phone call to an exterminator and a trip him ends this visit.As the story moves forward Em begins to show signs of becoming different. Her parents think it's nothing more than her reaction to their recent split. But there's more to it than that. A fight at school is described as more than a simple altercation with Em showing a substantial violent tendency that has he withdrawing from her friends as well.Clyde begins to suspect it has something to do with the box and takes it to school with him to have a colleague look it over. The friend reads the inscription which is in Hebrew and says that the box contains a Dibbuk, an evil demon whose spirit is said to be contained therein. Clyde considers this the possible reason for Em's outbursts and throws it away. When Em finds out, she makes it appear he's hit her and runs to rescue the box from where Clyde threw it away. She also causes Clyde to lose any and all custody of the girls.More strange things occur and Clyde continues to seek a way to save his little girl. With more research he travels to meet with a group of Hassidic Jews and shows them the box. They are the ones who finally give him the information he needs to know about what the box actually is. But will they help him rescue his daughter or is she condemned to whatever evil was contained inside the box?The film could seemingly boil down to being called a Jewish EXORCIST. But it's not quite the same. How the case is handled is much different. Yes, there are some similarities but on the whole the story is handled at a slower pace with quite a bit less of the gore effects. This story is more a battle of good and evil. It also deals more with the question of how far a parent will go to fight for his or her child and just what they are willing to accept.There isn't a bad performance in this film. I've become a big fan of Morgan since his days as the father of Sam and Dean Winchester on SUPERNATURAL. His portrayal of Clyde here shows the concern of a real parent for his child and the hopelessness he feels once he discovers what is causing the problem. Sedgwick does a great job as well although her time onscreen seems somewhat limited. What time she does have is well played. Both Davenport and Calls turn in great performances for actors so young. Calls especially stands out as Em, showing the two characters contained in one body convincingly.It's obvious from the box art for this DVD as well as the commercials that ran when it was in theaters (the ones that showed fingers trying to work their way out of Em's throat when she looked in the mirror) that this is a movie intent on scaring the viewer. I've seen plenty of horror films and this one actually did give me a start now and then. But more than just offering a few jump scares, this movie had you in its grip from start to finish. It didn't feel like it had wasted space or time spans that made you want to reach for the fast forward button. This movie keeps your attention till the end. And if you get scared along the way on this trip, then that's just icing on the cake.",4,RAIMI PRODUCES SCARES,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,4618,"['who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'name', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'guess', 'are', 'aware', 'movies', 'made', 'Lately', 'been', 'associated', 'first', 'Spider-man', 'trilogy', 'starring', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'long', 'Raimi', 'was', 'director', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'note', 'was', 'THE', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'still', 'one', 'scariest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'being', 'said', 'guess', 'wonder', 'Raimi', 'got', 'producing', 'side', 'business', 'latest', 'film', 'find', 'seat', 'POSSESSION', 'one', 'scariest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time.Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'Clyde', 'basketball', 'coach', 'recently', 'divorced', 'wife', 'Stephanie', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'couple', 'two', 'pre-teen', 'children', 'Hannah', 'Madison', 'Davenport', 'older', 'two', 'course', 'standard', 'troubled', 'pre-teen', 'Em', 'Natasha', 'Calls', 'younger', 'pair', 'still', 'high', 'hopes', 'parents', 'reuniting', 'new', 'man', 'life', 'highly', 'unlikely.On', 'weekend', 'when', 'Clyde', 'girls', 'staying', 'place', 'stop', 'yard', 'sale', 'where', 'Em', 'eye', 'attracted', 'what', 'be', 'antique', 'box', 'writings', 'carved', 'course', 'allowed', 'buy', 'then', 'home', 'puzzle', 'box', 'way', 'being', 'opened', 'eventually', 'Em', 'get', 'open', 'when', 'things', 'begin', 'happen.Small', 'things', 'first', 'single', 'moth', 'room', 'when', 'night', 'bunch', 'moths', 'show', 'up', 'bathroom', 'Hannah', 'Em', 'room', 'filled', 'brim', 'phone', 'call', 'exterminator', 'trip', 'story', 'forward', 'Em', 'show', 'signs', 'becoming', 'different', 'parents', 'think', 'nothing', 'more', 'reaction', 'recent', 'split', 'more', 'fight', 'school', 'described', 'more', 'simple', 'altercation', 'Em', 'showing', 'substantial', 'violent', 'tendency', 'withdrawing', 'friends', 'well.Clyde', 'suspect', 'something', 'do', 'box', 'school', 'have', 'colleague', 'look', 'friend', 'inscription', 'Hebrew', 'box', 'Dibbuk', 'evil', 'demon', 'spirit', 'said', 'be', 'contained', 'therein', 'Clyde', 'possible', 'reason', 'Em', 'outbursts', 'away', 'When', 'Em', 'out', 'hit', 'rescue', 'box', 'where', 'Clyde', 'threw', 'away', 'also', 'Clyde', 'lose', 'custody', 'girls.More', 'strange', 'things', 'occur', 'Clyde', 'seek', 'way', 'save', 'little', 'girl', 'more', 'research', 'meet', 'group', 'Hassidic', 'Jews', 'box', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'finally', 'give', 'information', 'know', 'what', 'box', 'actually', 'will', 'help', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'condemned', 'whatever', 'evil', 'was', 'contained', 'box', 'film', 'could', 'seemingly', 'boil', 'down', 'being', 'called', 'Jewish', 'EXORCIST', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'How', 'case', 'handled', 'much', 'different', 'Yes', 'are', 'similarities', 'whole', 'story', 'handled', 'slower', 'pace', 'bit', 'less', 'gore', 'effects', 'story', 'more', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'also', 'more', 'question', 'how', 'far', 'parent', 'will', 'go', 'fight', 'child', 'just', 'what', 'are', 'willing', 'accept.There', ""n't"", 'bad', 'performance', 'film', ""'ve"", 'become', 'big', 'fan', 'Morgan', 'days', 'father', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'Winchester', 'SUPERNATURAL', 'portrayal', 'Clyde', 'here', 'concern', 'real', 'parent', 'child', 'hopelessness', 'once', 'what', 'causing', 'problem', 'Sedgwick', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'onscreen', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'What', 'time', 'have', 'well', 'played', 'Davenport', 'Calls', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'so', 'young', 'Calls', 'especially', 'out', 'Em', 'showing', 'two', 'characters', 'contained', 'one', 'body', 'convincingly.It', 'obvious', 'box', 'art', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'commercials', 'ran', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'ones', 'showed', 'fingers', 'trying', 'work', 'way', 'Em', 'throat', 'when', 'looked', 'mirror', 'movie', 'intent', 'scaring', 'viewer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'actually', 'did', 'give', 'start', 'now', 'then', 'more', 'just', 'offering', 'few', 'jump', 'scares', 'movie', 'had', 'grip', 'start', 'finish', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'had', 'wasted', 'space', 'time', 'spans', 'made', 'want', 'reach', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'movie', 'attention', 'end', 'get', 'scared', 'way', 'trip', 'then', 'just', 'icing', 'cake']",N/A

1543869,AFOEWDLNUPFGW,B008220CFG,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","I think this movie was fantastic. The slow build of what the demon was doing to Emily, the daughter, was excellently done.  She didn't open the box and automatically become possessed; it was a slow build as it would be if a real possession were occurring.  The way they made the special effects that were used with the girl's eyes were a fantastic touch.  So often in these films you see the person's eyes roll in the back of their head but this time each moved independently of each other and they were moving sideways rather than up/down which added an air of creepiness to it, I think that's a good term here.I know some people will complain about the lack of blood & gore but personally I found the amount used in this film were perfect; after all, blood and gore doesn't make a horror movie good; it's what is left to your imagination such as when they don't show very much of what happened to Emily's teacher that makes a horror movie special.  I've seen many movies that had a ton of blood/gore and the movie was completely horrible, such as the Evil Dead movie.In closing I'll say this; it isn't often that a horror movie or a movie in general leave me with the chills after it's done being watched but this film actually did.  The man who played the father, who also happened to play the dad in the Supernatural series, really knows how to work the facial expressions and emotions; the way he looked when his daughter was fighting the possession and when he first figured out it wasn't human it added something special to the movie; that really tugged at your heart strings & believe me, that isn't easily done; especially in this day & age with the movie industry.

Its not all Raimis fault. First off he didn't direct this, he only produced it. Secondly there was something  like 14 other producers. So with that in mind you really can't lay to much blame on him. The blame, in my opinion falls on the shoulders of Ole Bornedal, who I personally have never heard of and have never seen or heard of, any of his previous movies.The movie just seems rather slow. There are a few scares but nothing really new, though the kitchen scene with the mother and the morgue scene were intense. The actress who played the possessed girl did a wonderful job, she can show so much emotion with just her eyes, and I really wish they would of given her more to work with, because she can make herself look so evil, but at the same time you can still tell that there is this innocent young girl trapped in this body, it is really remarkable.

Her divorced parents struggle with each other while the dad seems to almost immediately dive feet first into easily believing that a demon has possessed his daughter.I was entertained by the movie but it's not very scary and pretty predictable. The acting from Jeffrey Dean Morgan is great and the Jewish priest did an excellent job as well but every one else was mostly forgettable. The music was nothing special and there weren't that many effects to comment on or if there were they weren't impressive enough to think about.Several scenes would build to a high point but would then suddenly cut off to a new scene. It was as though the writers had written themselves into a corner and were unsure of how to end a scene so they just didn't and began the next one.Even though my review seems mostly negative I was interested all the way through I just had to keep stopping myself from noticing a lot of silly and easily avoidable mistakes. It's a very toned down horror flick but it's an entertaining one if you don't really think about it.Defiantly rent or get it from the library first because most adult horror fans will not enjoy it but it could be a good one for some people new to the genre or who aren't into horror movies that much.,3,extremely toned down but a decent time burner,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,1388,"['barely', 'original', 'plot', 'Possession', 'watch', 'young', 'girl', 'get', 'box', 'yard', 'sale', 'box', 'demon', 'divorced', 'parents', 'struggle', 'other', 'dad', 'almost', 'immediately', 'dive', 'feet', 'first', 'easily', 'believing', 'demon', 'possessed', 'daughter.I', 'was', 'entertained', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'scary', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'acting', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'great', 'Jewish', 'priest', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'well', 'one', 'else', 'was', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'music', 'was', 'nothing', 'special', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'many', 'effects', 'comment', 'were', 'were', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'enough', 'think', 'about.Several', 'scenes', 'would', 'build', 'high', 'point', 'would', 'then', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'off', 'new', 'scene', 'was', 'writers', 'had', 'written', 'corner', 'were', 'unsure', 'how', 'end', 'scene', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'began', 'next', 'one.Even', 'review', 'mostly', 'negative', 'was', 'interested', 'way', 'just', 'had', 'keep', 'stopping', 'noticing', 'lot', 'silly', 'easily', 'avoidable', 'mistakes', 'very', 'toned', 'down', 'horror', 'flick', 'entertaining', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'it.Defiantly', 'rent', 'get', 'library', 'first', 'most', 'adult', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'people', 'new', 'genre', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movies', 'much']",N/A

Apparently, this is weeks later form the old woman's attack, and nothing else happened to anyone who touched the box?Later on in the movie, the box is taken from the little girl and locked at school. Her teacher is alone in the room with the box after school. She is attacked and killed. The old lady went through just as savage an attack, but she wasn't killed?Later, the box is left in a open parking lot for quite a long period of time. At least a good ten hours plus. Right out in the middle of the lot. And no one disturbs it?The father is trying to destroy the box. He even carries it to the Jewish people to try and help him rid him of the demon/spirit. Not a peep from the demon. The thing in the box does not attack him until towards the end of the movie.  But the thing had beat the old woman to a pulp who approached it with a hammer, and killed the teacher who did nothing towards the box other than keep it in a room. But it won't attack the dad who was the biggest threat of all?The father only sees the girls on weekends. The girl only acts strange on his weekends? What about the other 5 days of the week?

1543900,A387BD735MI50R,B008220CFG,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","This movie itself doesn't have too much to offer that's new. If you've seen ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby,"" you'll probably feel you've seen most of the manifestations in this film before.Except, instead of the exorcism being performed in the more generally familiar Roman Catholic tradition, here we see the dybuk spirit being driven out by a member of the Hassidic Jewish tradition. The performer cast to play this exorcist's role had actually been a member of the Hassidic community, lending some authenticity and unique interest to the proceedings. For the most part though, the possessing agent is a familiar character, right down to its ravening appetite for raw meat.However, there are reasons to get this film. There are two commentaries on the disc. The one by director Ole Bornedal is hypnotic and eerie. He doesn't talk a lot about the technical aspects of making the film. No details about ""hand-held"" versus ""steady-cam."" Listening to him is like listening to a captivating storyteller around the campfire. In his softly advancing Scandinavian accent, he paces you through the film. ""And now the quiet, and now the quiet.""Then there's a narrative from one of the film's associates about how he actually acquired a kind of dybuk (dibbuk) box, and about the frightening trail of circumstances that (coincidentally?) arose from his possession of it. This narrative is also scarier than the movie itself. It comes with warnings similar to the warnings movie producer William Castle used to tantalize his audiences with in his B-movies of the 1950's. When the dybuk box will actually be shown as part of the bonus features, a caution to the audience appears. ""For your own safety, you might want to turn away from the screen."" It's ""Homicidal"" and ""The Tingler"" all over again - not as part of the movie, but in the usually blander commentaries.On a more realistic plane, the movie has an appealing romantic subplot and stars two handsome people - Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. So there's eye candy for both male and female viewers here. These stars portray a divorced couple drawn back together as they battle to reclaim the soul of their youngest daughter. Will they succeed? Will these beautiful people, who obviously still have so much feeling for each other, be able to sew their family back together?",3,Bonus Commentaries Are Scarier Than the Actual Movie,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,2329,"['movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'offer', 'new', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Exorcist', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'manifestations', 'film', 'before.Except', 'instead', 'exorcism', 'being', 'performed', 'more', 'generally', 'familiar', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'tradition', 'here', 'see', 'dybuk', 'spirit', 'being', 'driven', 'out', 'member', 'Hassidic', 'Jewish', 'tradition', 'performer', 'cast', 'play', 'exorcist', 'role', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'member', 'Hassidic', 'community', 'lending', 'authenticity', 'unique', 'interest', 'proceedings', 'most', 'part', 'possessing', 'agent', 'familiar', 'character', 'right', 'down', 'ravening', 'appetite', 'raw', 'meat.However', 'are', 'reasons', 'get', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', 'disc', 'one', 'director', 'Ole', 'Bornedal', 'hypnotic', 'eerie', ""n't"", 'talk', 'lot', 'technical', 'aspects', 'making', 'film', 'details', 'hand-held', 'steady-cam', 'Listening', 'listening', 'captivating', 'storyteller', 'campfire', 'softly', 'advancing', 'Scandinavian', 'accent', 'film', 'now', 'quiet', 'now', 'quiet', 'Then', 'narrative', 'one', 'film', 'associates', 'how', 'actually', 'acquired', 'kind', 'dybuk', 'dibbuk', 'box', 'frightening', 'trail', 'circumstances', 'coincidentally', 'arose', 'possession', 'narrative', 'also', 'scarier', 'movie', 'warnings', 'similar', 'warnings', 'movie', 'producer', 'William', 'Castle', 'used', 'tantalize', 'audiences', 'B-movies', '1950', 'When', 'dybuk', 'box', 'will', 'actually', 'be', 'shown', 'part', 'bonus', 'features', 'caution', 'audience', 'own', 'safety', 'might', 'want', 'turn', 'away', 'screen', 'Homicidal', 'Tingler', 'over', 'again', 'not', 'part', 'movie', 'usually', 'blander', 'commentaries.On', 'more', 'realistic', 'plane', 'movie', 'appealing', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'stars', 'two', 'handsome', 'people', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'eye', 'candy', 'male', 'female', 'viewers', 'here', 'stars', 'portray', 'divorced', 'couple', 'drawn', 'back', 'together', 'battle', 'reclaim', 'soul', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Will', 'succeed', 'Will', 'beautiful', 'people', 'who', 'obviously', 'still', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'feeling', 'other', 'be', 'able', 'sew', 'family', 'back', 'together']",N/A

Got a lead on the official Jewish binding and exorcism rituals, enter the(ir) title(s) as a comment to this request.Here's the official Roman Catholic Exorcism text:The Roman Ritual [Rituale Romanum]: Vol 2: Christian Burial, Exorcism, Reserved Blessings, etc [Latin/English]This movie sure is scary alright! I'm buying multiple copies of it for my collection.I won't say too much about the synopsis of this movie as you can read it elsewhere. In summary, this movie it's about a box containing an evil spirit that was bound by Jewish binding rituals. An unsuspecting girl, Emily, opens the box and gets possessed. Strange disturbances occur in the house. The daddy grows desperate in searching for answers that leads him to a Hasidic Jewish community. Although the storyline is simple enough, the drama such is tense and scary! Watch this movie in a theater and you could be jumping out of your seat!I'm collecting this movie because it is based on a true story, stories rather. Such things are quite common, even though they're never acknowledged by the general public.This movie will teach everyone a lesson: do NOT ever buy ancient, antique, curious items from unknown sellers, especially those that come with unknown inscriptions that cannot be traced to a safe and reliable source.The story in this movie is not something new to me, I've personally heard such stories from elsewhere. This is a reason why I went to watch this scary movie.Sorry to say this, but this is also not the first time I hear of most Jews refusing to exorcise a possessed person out of fear, as seen in the movie. So, what would I advise the daddy in this movie to do? If the Jews are reluctant to deal with their own rituals, go find a real Catholic priest (not those Liberal unbelievers)! For serious cases like the one you see in this movie, it is not advisable to do the ritual on your own like what the daddy tried to do in this movie.If victims like this Emily character is looking for a lasting solution to her afflictions, the only solution is to turn to the Catholic Church for answers. However, applying for an official exorcism in the Catholic Church could take months for formal approval as the applicant is being checked out and examines by secular medical community and then by the ecclesiastical authorities. There are many reasons for this seemingly bureaucratic process. The Church has had enough of its skeptical and time-wasting scoffers. In the majority of cases, most common applicants need not have a formal exorcism in the first place. Most afflicted applicants give up before they even begin. Compound the bureaucratic process with the fact that the current establishment is Liberal, you'd just have to find a listening ear by looking for a validly ordained Conservative or Traditional priest. There are also the informal rites that an applicant could seek out within the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has had over 2000 years of historical experience in these things, why find your solutions elsewhere?The Jews (among others) may bind evil spirits to objects (eg. boxes) to be discarded or buried (posing a danger to an unsuspecting finder); the Catholic Church sends these evil spirits back to Hell. Now, which solution do YOU think is safer for the victim?The prayers in the following books are useful:Roman Ritual, Weller (Rituale Romanum, Full Set of three Volumes)Beware the NightSt. Michael and the Angels:  A Month With St. Michael and the Holy AngelsAn Exorcist Tells His StoryAn Exorcist: More StoriesThe Dark Sacrament: True Stories of Modern-Day Demon Possession and ExorcismCase studies:Begone SatanThe Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine WarrenHostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans",5,Scary!

I am a horror film geek since i saw the original Halloween then all of the other classics Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St.  The movies have changed like saw which is amazingly addictive for the true horror geek. But this film went back old school, tugged at our hearts because a family was being destroyed without any hope. The audience doesnt completely know what is going to happen. We have an idea but nothing concrete like alot of films today. Then they use everyday things throughout the film to remind us this truly could be Us!!! Like the cell phone flash light. Maybe high tech for old school but we dont need matches anymore if our phones are charged. Same scary alone can see only inches infront of your face as a match. The phone cant give us a one up on the supernatural hence very very creepy and eye squinting time. The ending was a terrific idea. wont get into it for those who havent seen this gem. Really good. It was a nice ride and nod to ""realism"" and let our minds mess us up(such as my fear of antiquiesque shopping)rather than being hand held placed where they want us and listen to thier explicit instructions on how to watch and understand for optimum viewing. You fellow horror ""geeks"" know asap as to which films i am speaking of ;) sit back and enjoy thats all they ask for in this film.
