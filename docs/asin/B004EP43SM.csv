Cuba Gooding Jr. is a great actor and did a wonderful job in this movie.  The other actors were good and the plot had lots of depth.  However, there were a few parts that I felt dragged on a bit.  I would have liked to have seen more action but overall, I would say that it's a decent viewing experience.

1398270,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004EP43SM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","SACRIFICE (2011, 70 minutes) I saw this weird, clich&eacute;-ridden thing on Showtime, but it looked like a made-for-Showtime-then-straight-to-video rattletrap production. Even though it was terrible ""cop drama"", it seemed to me to be some sort of public service announcement. A public service announcement conceived and written by someone on drugs.A handsome teen boy immersed in the criminal underworld becomes repentant, mostly due to his little sister. Both are orphaned and the boy has been finding solace for his guilty soul in a Catholic church, helped by the friendly Father Porter (Christian Slater in his second role as a weird priest). Into this blend is mixed a bizarre father-and-son criminal team, and a ""haunted"" cop (Cuba Gooding) who lost his wife and daughter rounds out the ensemble.A statue of the Virgin Mary made of heroin constitutes the only glue that holds this rickety story together. After some flashbacks and other incredibly ugly scenes of violence - presumably showing us that is the price we pay for the drug trade - more than a few people are killed and everyone ends up burning the heroin Virgin right in front of the cathedral. Of course, this is after the gunfight in the cathedral, in which Father Porter plays a vital shooting role: he served in Afghanistan, don't you know.Upon the conclusion of this ""film"", strange information is flashed on the screen: statistics concerning the drug trade through Canada, the salaries of American police officers, the tenfold increase in drug trade out of Afghanistan because of the war, even some strange mini-biography of drug lord Pablo Escobar.This is set in Canada (it was the second film I'd seen that day set in Montreal), so I could understand the reason for the Canadian factoid - but the other stuff? What the heck was that all about?! Pablo Escobar?? It was as if someone was nettled by the stats and decided to make a film symbolizing the stats. Not a good reason for making a film like this.SACRIFICE is really a humbug and a waste of time. I suppose if I were in high school and they showed this, I'd have been impressed (minus the rape, graphic violence and the insanely frequent swearing). After all, when I was a kid, they showed us BLOOD ON THE ASHPHALT and we still talk about that movie.Unless you must own every picture Cuba or Christian have been in, I'd say ""PASS"" on this rotten waste of film.",1,""" 'Sacrifice' means 'to make holy' "" ... so I guess this is a holy movie",1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,2391,"['SACRIFICE', '2011', '70', 'minutes', 'saw', 'weird', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'thing', 'Showtime', 'looked', 'made-for-Showtime-then-straight-to-video', 'rattletrap', 'production', 'Even', 'was', 'terrible', 'cop', 'drama', 'seemed', 'be', 'sort', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'A', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'conceived', 'written', 'someone', 'drugs.A', 'handsome', 'teen', 'boy', 'immersed', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'repentant', 'mostly', 'due', 'little', 'sister', 'are', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'been', 'finding', 'solace', 'guilty', 'soul', 'Catholic', 'church', 'helped', 'friendly', 'Father', 'Porter', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'second', 'role', 'weird', 'priest', 'blend', 'mixed', 'bizarre', 'father-and-son', 'criminal', 'team', 'haunted', 'cop', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'daughter', 'out', 'ensemble.A', 'statue', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'made', 'heroin', 'only', 'glue', 'rickety', 'story', 'together', 'flashbacks', 'other', 'incredibly', 'ugly', 'scenes', 'violence', 'presumably', 'showing', 'price', 'pay', 'drug', 'trade', 'more', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'everyone', 'up', 'burning', 'heroin', 'Virgin', 'right', 'front', 'cathedral', 'course', 'gunfight', 'cathedral', 'Father', 'Porter', 'vital', 'shooting', 'role', 'served', 'Afghanistan', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Upon', 'conclusion', 'film', 'strange', 'information', 'flashed', 'screen', 'statistics', 'concerning', 'drug', 'trade', 'Canada', 'salaries', 'American', 'police', 'officers', 'tenfold', 'increase', 'drug', 'trade', 'Afghanistan', 'war', 'even', 'strange', 'mini-biography', 'drug', 'lord', 'Pablo', 'Escobar.This', 'set', 'Canada', 'was', 'second', 'film', ""'d"", 'seen', 'day', 'set', 'Montreal', 'could', 'understand', 'reason', 'Canadian', 'factoid', 'other', 'stuff', 'What', 'heck', 'was', 'Pablo', 'Escobar', 'was', 'someone', 'was', 'nettled', 'stats', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'symbolizing', 'stats', 'Not', 'good', 'reason', 'making', 'film', 'this.SACRIFICE', 'really', 'humbug', 'waste', 'time', 'suppose', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'showed', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'impressed', 'rape', 'graphic', 'violence', 'insanely', 'frequent', 'swearing', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'showed', 'BLOOD', 'ON', 'THE', 'ASHPHALT', 'still', 'talk', 'movie.Unless', 'must', 'own', 'picture', 'Cuba', 'Christian', 'have', 'been', ""'d"", 'say', 'PASS', 'rotten', 'waste', 'film']",N/A

Christian Slater plays the cussing, drinking killer priest (all only in church though) and Kim Coates plays the bad guy. At the ten-minute mark the screening became almost a laugh track as so many things had already gone wrong; The BD clarity was DVD to below average quality, the sound had been mixed poorly in every scene, the writing was obviously being improvised (later proven so in the making-of), and the overall feel of the film was beneath the low-budget approach.The long list of things that kept going wrong with the film made it to where I ended up offering the film for free and no customers were interested that had watched the clips. The music score drowned out dialogue, the flashbacks throughout the film of varying characters were cartoonish, and when the two main leads (Gooding and Slater) made it appear they were unhappy and miserable doing their parts - the film just becomes pointless. Kim Coates does save the day though, both in the film and in the making-of. The 11:49 minute supplement is also laughable as they left in all of the ""chaotic"" issues in making this film. But Kim gave a great snippet about knowing Gary Oldman years before and the advice shared by Gary to him, worth the watch just for that.The packaging shows Region 1 coded (obviously Millenium does not even invest in making their BD art correct), the sound says 5.1 but I dispute even that, English and Spanish subs. Writing about this will seem like I am trying to find more things wrong with the film but mostly I was making sure the four planted reviews here were countered just a bit.

Afterward, he teams up with Jack Daniels to live a miserable life as the Toronto police force's ""Dirty Harry light"". In the city there is a drug lord with a techno dance club, where sex can be had in the restrooms as lovers snort lines off each others body (you know the place). Mike, a young drug dealer wants out.
