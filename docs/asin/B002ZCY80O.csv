The first season was a real cliffhanger, and I regretted only that I didn't have time for a marathon to watch all of it.Second season was good, but strangely anemic considering all the intrigues, assaults, betrayals, and occasional conversations with the dead. When the third season started, I already was wondering just how much more meanness, treachery and flashbacks I could take.I watched the first episode, and it seemed very formulaic, even if the story was different. The flashbacks grew ever more irritating. An event in season three will completely alter the structure of the firm, and what will follow is completely predictable.The characters are well acted, maybe too much so, because I got to the point where I couldn't stand the sight of Ellen anymore, and wished Frobisher would somehow come back. When one is wishing for Frobisher as a shining light, well, there's a problem. It doesn't seem that there will be anything new in this series.

1299728,A2X5CT26HL2CH3,B002ZCY80O,"Barbara W. Robbins ""RobbinsRoost""","[0, 0]","I started watching""Damages"" on Amazon Prime. This was after I had watched ""Justified"" about 4 times all the way through, and had become a fan of Timothy Olyphant. Of course I am a Glenn Close fan, so I was delighted to learn that Olyphant was in the series in Season 2. I started watching Season 3 anxiously waiting to learn what had happened to Olyphant's character, ""Wes,"" and the investigation to his  opponent, Rick Messer's murder.. Imagine my disappointment that Olyphant didn't show up until the last episode of the season, and the entire drama of the closing of the 2nd season was barely mentioned. I understand why this happened, and it was a good thing for Olyphant that he had the opportunity to lead in ""Justified,"" about the time the 3rd season of ""Damages"" started, but the way it was handled didn't make much sense. The series had the potential to be great and 5 star all the way, but my main reason for the 3 stars is the way all episodes in all seasons switch around in time sequence. I don't know why the producers decided to do that. I could understand a flashback, starting in the present, going back, and then continuing in the present, but I truly don't see where this constant ""5 weeks earlier,"" ""Thanksgiving Day,"" etc improves upon the story line. Thankfully, I watched episodes back to back on Prime; I can't imagine trying to keep up with this week to week on television. Actually, I find that is the best way to watch a series anyway. I will continue watching ""Damages,"" and start the 4th season, though I will miss Olyphant. I can watch him this January in ""Justified."" Still, I think his character exit might have been handled differently. Having Ellen jumping into bed with the reporter, who looks vaguely like ""Wes,"" makes her seem  a little desperate. The best part of ""Damages,"" is the talented acting pool. The worst is the crazy in and out of the present time sequence.",3,"Could Be Great, but Confusing With All the Time Switches",1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,1905,"['started', 'watching', 'Damages', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'was', 'had', 'watched', 'Justified', '4', 'times', 'way', 'had', 'become', 'fan', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'course', 'am', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'fan', 'was', 'delighted', 'learn', 'Olyphant', 'was', 'series', 'Season', '2', 'started', 'watching', 'Season', '3', 'anxiously', 'waiting', 'learn', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'Olyphant', 'character', 'Wes', 'investigation', 'opponent', 'Rick', 'Messer', 'murder..', 'Imagine', 'disappointment', 'Olyphant', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'entire', 'drama', 'closing', '2nd', 'season', 'was', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'understand', 'why', 'happened', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'Olyphant', 'had', 'opportunity', 'lead', 'Justified', 'time', '3rd', 'season', 'Damages', 'started', 'way', 'was', 'handled', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'series', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', '5', 'star', 'way', 'main', 'reason', '3', 'stars', 'way', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'switch', 'time', 'sequence', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'producers', 'decided', 'do', 'could', 'understand', 'flashback', 'starting', 'present', 'going', 'back', 'then', 'continuing', 'present', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'constant', '5', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'story', 'line', 'Thankfully', 'watched', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', 'Prime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'week', 'week', 'television', 'Actually', 'find', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'series', 'anyway', 'will', 'continue', 'watching', 'Damages', 'start', '4th', 'season', 'will', 'miss', 'Olyphant', 'can', 'watch', 'January', 'Justified', 'Still', 'think', 'character', 'exit', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'differently', 'Having', 'Ellen', 'jumping', 'bed', 'reporter', 'who', 'vaguely', 'Wes', 'seem', 'little', 'desperate', 'best', 'part', 'Damages', 'talented', 'acting', 'pool', 'worst', 'crazy', 'present', 'time', 'sequence']",Damages: Season 3

1299733,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B002ZCY80O,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[14, 25]","If the Bernie Madoff story fascinates you, then you will enjoy this season.  If you are sick of that story, you won't like it.  That is Patty Hughes' case this season although given another name. Lily Tomlin plays ""Mrs. Bernie Madoff"" and Campbell Scott plays the son.  They are both terrific. Since this is ""fiction"", the show can posit answers which don't exist in the real world, such as where the money is that they've probably stashed away for themselves. Ted Danson makes a reappearance in his king villain role. He is sensational. His religious conversion in and of itself is a great story line, only equalled by his getting a top movie star to do the story of his life. Actually, if everyone else disappeared and we followed only the Ted Danson show from here on, this show would be 5 stars.Then there are the things I don't like.  I still don't like the way the script jumps back and forth in time. This can be done by a director with terrific skills (think Scorsese) but in the hands of most others, it just ends up confusing, not to mention unduly repetitive. There are also still too many characters and actors in this series, which has been its problem from day one.  When you have Glenn Close, Ted Danson, Lily Tomlin and Campbell Scott in your cast, WHY would you want to draw attention AWAY from them and onto lesser actors? Finally, the Rose Byrne character I still find mostly annoying.  Either get a stronger actress to play her role or eliminate her character. Three seasons in, I am also very annoyed with all the allusions cast in all three seasons that Patty may be her real mother. I don't know if it is a red herring or not and don't much care.  I just would like it out of the script as it interferes with the more interesting case going on in the season.",4,Good But Could Be Sensational,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,1781,"['Bernie', 'Madoff', 'story', 'fascinates', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'season', 'are', 'sick', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'Patty', 'Hughes', 'case', 'season', 'given', 'name', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Mrs.', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'son', 'are', 'terrific', 'fiction', 'show', 'can', 'posit', 'answers', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'such', 'where', 'money', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'stashed', 'away', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'reappearance', 'king', 'villain', 'role', 'sensational', 'religious', 'conversion', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'only', 'equalled', 'getting', 'top', 'movie', 'star', 'do', 'story', 'life', 'Actually', 'everyone', 'else', 'disappeared', 'followed', 'only', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'show', 'here', 'show', 'would', 'be', '5', 'stars.Then', 'are', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'script', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'director', 'terrific', 'skills', 'think', 'Scorsese', 'hands', 'most', 'others', 'just', 'up', 'confusing', 'not', 'mention', 'unduly', 'repetitive', 'are', 'also', 'still', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'actors', 'series', 'been', 'problem', 'day', 'one', 'When', 'have', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'cast', 'WHY', 'would', 'want', 'draw', 'attention', 'AWAY', 'lesser', 'actors', 'Finally', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'character', 'still', 'find', 'mostly', 'annoying', 'get', 'stronger', 'actress', 'play', 'role', 'eliminate', 'character', 'Three', 'seasons', 'am', 'also', 'very', 'annoyed', 'allusions', 'cast', 'three', 'seasons', 'Patty', 'may', 'be', 'real', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'red', 'herring', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'just', 'would', 'like', 'script', 'more', 'interesting', 'case', 'going', 'season']",Damages: Season 3

Season 3 is a labyrynthine mix of greed, deception, lies, revelations, secrets---you name it, you got it.  Without setting one foot in the courtroom, DAMAGES is legal drama at its best.  The scripts and direction are superior, weaving intense personal subplots into the main plot.And the acting?  Brilliant to say the least.  Glenn Close brings a complexity to Patty Hewes that transcends the usual villainess persona.  Shrewd--manipulative--ambitious--maybe even evil..but few characters on TV are as multidimensional as Patty and no one could portray her any better than Close.  Rose Byrne is equally impressive, a Patty Hewes in the making.  Byrne and Close work beautifully together.  Given a larger role this season, Tate Donovan is mesmerizing as the doomed Tom Shayes.

Here, characterizations are a great deal thinner, their natures not as developed or believable. It's not the as-always great acting of Close & Co, but the writing. Characters seem cartoon-ish, abbreviated, stereotyped.There seems to be more superfluous characters. Add to that, central characters were given hasty-seeming melodramatic exit scenarios to wrap up their parts. Those extraneous characters were given quick hello's and then contrived reasons for sudden goodbye's.There won't be any spoilers in this review, because there are just so many of them; shocking denouements which suddenly usher characters out; most seeming rushed and melodramatic; maybe called for by stereotyped characters there only to justify some plot twist.Overall it seems this season was designed to end the series.

Where season one was an extremely tight, maniacal thriller, and season two was a knotty, complex, esponiage-esque mystery, season three takes a cue from classic noir sensibilities. Season three is extremely understated and character driven. They are more concerned with digging into the character's psyches than with the actual court case. A standout aspect to the season is Patty's intriguing dream sequences. As for the case, it's almost non-existant, which is the point. The fact that the true center of the case remains a mystery up until the last episode helps enforce the centerless, surreal world of noir. Like any good noir, you never feel safe when watching season three.My advice is that you need to be patient with this season. It's not as instantly rewarding as the other two, but the ending does pack a punch. I don't want to spell out all the noir connections in this little review because part of the fun is trying to figure them all out. Do some research on what makes something 'noir' and see if you agree with me. What you can expect more of in season three: is stellar acting from the impeccable cast, great dialogue and narrative construction and a very timely court case.'Damages' is a phenomenal show and I think season three will be very rewarding to long time fans and especially to patient, attentive viewers.'Damages' season three comes highly recommended.",5,"An understated, noir infused season.",1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1467,"['third', 'season', ""'Damages"", 'bit', 'departure', 'pervious', 'two', 'seasons', 'Where', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'extremely', 'tight', 'maniacal', 'thriller', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'knotty', 'complex', 'esponiage-esque', 'mystery', 'season', 'three', 'cue', 'classic', 'noir', 'sensibilities', 'Season', 'three', 'extremely', 'understated', 'character', 'driven', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'digging', 'character', 'psyches', 'actual', 'court', 'case', 'standout', 'aspect', 'season', 'Patty', 'intriguing', 'dream', 'sequences', 'case', 'almost', 'non-existant', 'point', 'fact', 'true', 'center', 'case', 'mystery', 'up', 'last', 'episode', 'enforce', 'centerless', 'surreal', 'world', 'noir', 'good', 'noir', 'never', 'feel', 'safe', 'when', 'watching', 'season', 'three.My', 'advice', 'need', 'be', 'patient', 'season', 'not', 'as', 'instantly', 'rewarding', 'other', 'two', 'ending', 'pack', 'punch', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spell', 'out', 'noir', 'connections', 'little', 'review', 'part', 'fun', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'Do', 'research', 'what', 'something', 'see', 'agree', 'What', 'can', 'expect', 'more', 'season', 'three', 'stellar', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'cast', 'great', 'dialogue', 'narrative', 'construction', 'very', 'timely', 'court', 'case', ""'Damages"", 'phenomenal', 'show', 'think', 'season', 'three', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'rewarding', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'especially', 'patient', 'attentive', 'viewers', ""'Damages"", 'season', 'three', 'highly', 'recommended']",Damages: Season 3
