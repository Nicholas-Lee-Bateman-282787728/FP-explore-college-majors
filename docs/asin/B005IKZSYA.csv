1461883,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005IKZSYA,Andrew Ellington,"[20, 21]","I was highly impressed with this gem of a film, one that obviously understood the beauty of a subtle and meaningful approach to a controversial subject without shying away from inserting needed moments of humor and charm.  Tackling the idea of doubt, insecurity and wavering faith, `We Have a Pope' addresses a concern that may not be thought of very often but one that deserves our attention.  By centering the affair on a newly elected Pope who feels inadequate and quite frankly overwhelmed by the assignment bestowed on him by God, `We Have a Pope' adds a serious depth to the age-old topic of personal spirituality.  With a blisteringly authentic performance by Michael Piccoli, this beautiful film moves with grace and highlights emotional assertions that one cannot help but feel akin to.  Piccoli should be up for Oscar consideration, but that won't happen.  The way he balances out this conflicted man's fears and enchantments is astonishing to watch.  Such a soulful performance, one imbued with sharp passion and integrity.  At the end of the day, `We Have a Pope' never backs away or exposes a lazy or easy out but instead rounds out to a moment of responsibility that shines bright despite the crushing reality of the decision made (crushing on most, but freeing for one).  It is a beautiful film that remains provoking while wholly entertaining; something most films strive to be but fail miserably to become.",5,We have a winner!,1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,1423,"['was', 'highly', 'impressed', 'gem', 'film', 'one', 'obviously', 'understood', 'beauty', 'subtle', 'meaningful', 'approach', 'controversial', 'subject', 'shying', 'away', 'inserting', 'needed', 'moments', 'humor', 'charm', 'Tackling', 'idea', 'doubt', 'insecurity', 'wavering', 'faith', 'Have', 'Pope', 'concern', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'thought', 'very', 'often', 'one', 'attention', 'centering', 'affair', 'newly', 'elected', 'Pope', 'who', 'feels', 'inadequate', 'quite', 'frankly', 'overwhelmed', 'assignment', 'bestowed', 'God', 'Have', 'Pope', 'serious', 'depth', 'age-old', 'topic', 'personal', 'spirituality', 'blisteringly', 'authentic', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Piccoli', 'beautiful', 'film', 'moves', 'grace', 'highlights', 'emotional', 'assertions', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'akin', 'Piccoli', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'out', 'conflicted', 'man', 'fears', 'enchantments', 'astonishing', 'watch', 'soulful', 'performance', 'one', 'imbued', 'sharp', 'passion', 'integrity', 'end', 'day', 'Have', 'Pope', 'never', 'away', 'lazy', 'easy', 'out', 'instead', 'out', 'moment', 'responsibility', 'shines', 'bright', 'crushing', 'reality', 'decision', 'made', 'crushing', 'most', 'freeing', 'one', 'beautiful', 'film', 'provoking', 'wholly', 'entertaining', 'something', 'most', 'films', 'strive', 'be', 'fail', 'miserably', 'become']","We Have a Pope Habemus Papam  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Italy"

Pouliot,"[2, 3]","When Cardinal Melville unexpectedly finds himself elected Pope, he panics, literally running away screaming from the papal balcony and his first benediction of the faithful. This situation might have set up a comic restoration of the pope to his nerve, or a satirical look at church politics. It does neither. Though sumptuously filmed and well-acted, the film finds itself wandering among various plot threads, none of which is thoroughly explored or exploited. Why did the pope run away? There are hints of hysterical memory loss, the unresolved matter of a sister turned actress, and perhaps a sense of his inner unworthiness. But nothing comes of these hints.  The psychoanalyst brought in to treat the pontiff is secular, but little is made of his role, other than a long scene in which he organizes the cardinals (locked in the Vatican until the pope recovers) in a round robin volleyball tournament. The film's sudden and baffling ending left many viewers unsatisfied.If there is any action in the movie at all, it is at a subtle and symbolic level. The shrink (played by director Nanni Moretti) is a member of a Freudian priesthood that runs counter to that of the church. Psychoanalysis has at least as many certain and unassailable ""answers"" as the church, and there might be some point in setting these institutions against each other. The volleyball game has a touch of church geopolitics about it. The cardinals are teamed by continent, each wearing colored markers similar to priestly chasubles. The analyst's organizing the teams then becomes a stand-in for the way the Vatican organizes the church's worldwide leadership. But if there was a point to be made, it was lost on me. The pope's dalliance with an acting troupe showed him as a sentimental thespian manqu&eacute;. But otherwise, his association with the troupe was wasted.""We Have A Pope"" is teeming with such unfulfilled promises. Michel Piccoli is frail, human and bewildered in the role of the pope. But his character does little more than wander aimlessly, meandering through the streets of Rome with no purpose, no goal and no final destination. Like this film.

After a few minutes of fourth grade discernment, she presented her work:--Plan A had five excellent reasons in favor.--Plan B had just five words: None, None, None, None, None!I chuckled and thought, ""Memo to Self: Read another book on coaching!""So with Plan A and Plan B fresh in my mind, I treated myself this weekend to a second viewing of this wonderful film, We Have a Pope (Habemus Papam).

The papal conclave is in session--and balloting has begun.  The thunderous murmuring from dozens of cardinals needs no sub-titles: ""Not me, Lord! Not me!""

He is unprepared, he thinks, for this one-in-a-billion leadership challenge--and the cardinals (still locked in the Vatican, without cell phones) are not much help to their new leader. Yet he had their votes. Hmmm. Plan A or Plan B?It's a humorous, but eye-opening study in leadership trauma.  It's the perfect video to watch this week--as we watch Rome.

I gave it two stars because there WERE some cute scenes and the trailer was good.  All the sub-story lines just kind of wandered around into oblivion though and the ending was so depressing.

1461899,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005IKZSYA,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 13]","""Habemus Papam"" (""We Have a Pope"") is an Italian comedy drama directed by Nanni Moretti (""The Son's Room""). Michel Piccoli plays Cardinal Melville, who, after being elected Pope, insists that he cannot take the office and flees the conclave. The story may remind you of a William Wyler classic, but the intriguing premise is less effectively used here.The director's bold attempt to portray a pope as a human is a worthy one, but his approach is tame at best. Michel Piccoli is wonderful as Cardinal Melville, but even the veteran player like Piccoli cannot make the character of Cardinal Melville credible, because the unfocused script fails to delve into his personality as deeply as it should. His interactions with people in Rome do not reveal much about the person for which the film is made. The reference to a stage drama (Chekhov ... what else?) is too obvious. After all, we are all actors.Moretti himself plays a psychiatrist, who is called in to talk to the newly elected pope (while other cardinals are watching). The nicely understated comic scene is pretty funny, but his character overstays its welcome and becomes a little annoying when he starts organizing a volleyball tournament for the cardinals. This subplot adds nothing to the film's intriguing theme.I think there is nothing that would offend the viewers. Not one person is described in a negative light. I respect Moretti's decision to tell the story in this way, but maybe he went too far. Despite the interesting idea, the film's narrative lacks the emotion and tension between the characters, most of whom look one-dimensional. How would other cardinals feel and react (when we know through their voiceovers that most of them, like Cardinal Melville, did not want to be elected), for instance? You will not know.This is a big problem with the film because here we see possibilities for a more dramatic storyline, which Moretti seems to ignore. ""We Have a Pope"" is most effective when it shows the subtle performances from Michel Piccoli. It is regrettable that they didn't come up with a better story to tell for his character.",3,"(2.5 STARS) ""Habemus Papam"": Intriguing Idea Not Fully Developed",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,2105,"['Habemus', 'Papam', 'Have', 'Pope', 'Italian', 'comedy', 'drama', 'directed', 'Nanni', 'Moretti', 'Son', 'Room', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'Cardinal', 'Melville', 'who', 'being', 'elected', 'Pope', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'office', 'conclave', 'story', 'may', 'remind', 'William', 'Wyler', 'classic', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'less', 'effectively', 'used', 'here.The', 'director', 'bold', 'attempt', 'portray', 'pope', 'human', 'worthy', 'one', 'approach', 'tame', 'best', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'wonderful', 'Cardinal', 'Melville', 'even', 'veteran', 'player', 'Piccoli', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'character', 'Cardinal', 'Melville', 'credible', 'unfocused', 'script', 'delve', 'personality', 'as', 'deeply', 'should', 'interactions', 'people', 'Rome', 'do', 'not', 'reveal', 'much', 'person', 'film', 'made', 'reference', 'stage', 'drama', 'Chekhov', 'what', 'else', 'too', 'obvious', 'are', 'actors.Moretti', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'called', 'talk', 'newly', 'elected', 'pope', 'other', 'cardinals', 'are', 'watching', 'nicely', 'understated', 'comic', 'scene', 'pretty', 'funny', 'character', 'welcome', 'little', 'annoying', 'when', 'organizing', 'volleyball', 'tournament', 'cardinals', 'subplot', 'nothing', 'film', 'intriguing', 'theme.I', 'think', 'nothing', 'would', 'offend', 'viewers', 'Not', 'one', 'person', 'described', 'negative', 'light', 'respect', 'Moretti', 'decision', 'tell', 'story', 'way', 'maybe', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'interesting', 'idea', 'film', 'narrative', 'emotion', 'tension', 'characters', 'most', 'whom', 'look', 'one-dimensional', 'How', 'would', 'other', 'cardinals', 'feel', 'react', 'when', 'know', 'voiceovers', 'most', 'Cardinal', 'Melville', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'elected', 'instance', 'will', 'not', 'know.This', 'big', 'problem', 'film', 'here', 'see', 'possibilities', 'more', 'dramatic', 'storyline', 'Moretti', 'ignore', 'Have', 'Pope', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'subtle', 'performances', 'Michel', 'Piccoli', 'regrettable', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'better', 'story', 'tell', 'character']","We Have a Pope Habemus Papam  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Italy"
