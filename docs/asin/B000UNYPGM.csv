I have loved this series for years now and have bought all the DVD sets as they became available. But like most of my (slightly) older DVD sets, they have become ragged over time and the odd DVD out of the sets would become scratched or misplaced. So, it's so wonderful to finally have all the seasons and all the specials in one nice box. Out with the old collection of seasons in different boxes and in with this new set! And speaking of presentation, this set is wonderful. The casing is this really shiny silvery fabric and the interior is colorful and very well put together. There's even a cute leopard-print like bookmark that is attached to the set!!!! So, we are thrilled with this release. Like I said, it is a series that we have enjoyed repeatedly over the years and it is so nice to finally have the entire series in one box.

I didn't find it funny and I didn't like the two middle aged flakey women who were its stars.  Fast Forward to a year later. I put it on my own DVD player and began watching, not expecting much of anything....AND I LOVED IT!!! Part of the problem may be that it has taken me awhile to ""get"" British humor.  Now, even though I get it most of the time, I still don't get it the first time necessarily.I've since read that Jennifer Saunders, writer and one of the leads, actually met a real life woman in Britain who lived like this character and Saunders based the entire series on her.  The woman has a son instead of a daughter but basically the rest of it is true.  There was no matching friend though as there is in the series.  It seems incredible to me that there really is someone like this in the real world but truth often is very strange.Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley play the two women, Edina and Patsy, two women left over from the counter culture, rock and roll, heavy drug use, let it all hang out days.  Patsy has made it fairly big in fashion writing and Edina likewise in PR. The reason for their success is that these two have never met a fad or a trend which they didn't embrace completely.  Edina has a teenage daughter and two ex-husbands.  Patsy remained single.The daughter Saffy is the straight character as she is the practical, self reliant one in between these two ditzes.  That Edina and Patsy would fly the Concorde to New York from London just to find a doorknob is the epitome of the absurdist line of their thinking.These two remind me of Lucy and Ethel from I LOVE LUCY.  Yes, on the surface they would appear to be completely different comic duos. For one, Edina and Patsy have money to burn whereas Lucy and Ethel had more limited means.  However, both duos were capable of doing ANYTHING once they set their minds to doing or getting something.Perhaps the thing I like best about this series is that if you feel down or depressed, Edina and Patsy can lift you out of the dumps and into the heights of lunacy.",5,Took Me Two Tries and Then I Adored It!,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,2167,"['friend', 'had', 'watch', 'show', 'thought', 'was', 'nuts', 'when', 'was', 'laughing', 'uproariously', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'two', 'middle', 'aged', 'flakey', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'stars', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'year', 'later', 'put', 'own', 'DVD', 'player', 'began', 'watching', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'anything', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'Part', 'problem', 'may', 'be', 'taken', 'get', 'British', 'humor', 'Now', 'even', 'get', 'most', 'time', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'time', 'necessarily.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'writer', 'one', 'leads', 'actually', 'met', 'real', 'life', 'woman', 'Britain', 'who', 'lived', 'character', 'Saunders', 'based', 'entire', 'series', 'woman', 'son', 'instead', 'daughter', 'basically', 'rest', 'true', 'was', 'matching', 'friend', 'series', 'incredible', 'really', 'someone', 'real', 'world', 'truth', 'often', 'very', 'strange.Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'play', 'two', 'women', 'Edina', 'Patsy', 'two', 'women', 'left', 'over', 'counter', 'culture', 'rock', 'roll', 'heavy', 'drug', 'use', 'let', 'hang', 'out', 'days', 'Patsy', 'made', 'fairly', 'big', 'fashion', 'writing', 'Edina', 'likewise', 'PR', 'reason', 'success', 'two', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'fad', 'trend', 'did', ""n't"", 'embrace', 'completely', 'Edina', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'two', 'ex-husbands', 'Patsy', 'remained', 'single.The', 'daughter', 'Saffy', 'straight', 'character', 'practical', 'reliant', 'one', 'two', 'ditzes', 'Edina', 'Patsy', 'would', 'fly', 'Concorde', 'New', 'York', 'London', 'just', 'find', 'doorknob', 'epitome', 'absurdist', 'line', 'thinking.These', 'two', 'Lucy', 'Ethel', 'LOVE', 'LUCY', 'Yes', 'surface', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'comic', 'duos', 'one', 'Edina', 'Patsy', 'have', 'money', 'burn', 'whereas', 'Lucy', 'Ethel', 'had', 'more', 'limited', 'means', 'However', 'duos', 'were', 'capable', 'doing', 'ANYTHING', 'once', 'set', 'minds', 'doing', 'getting', 'something.Perhaps', 'thing', 'like', 'best', 'series', 'feel', 'down', 'depressed', 'Edina', 'Patsy', 'can', 'lift', 'dumps', 'heights', 'lunacy']",Absolutely Fabulous: Absolutely Everything

I realized that the silver is flaking off, like it's some sort of paint. This is happening around the edges and in the corners. What's underneath is a really hideous light yellow/brown color...The cardboard pages inside are all glued in at an angle which makes the book uneven and I've noticed some of the cardboard slips that hold the DVDs are way too tight, that leads to scratching. Seems like this was just carelessly thrown together without much thought.Like I said, it's beautiful at first, really great design...however, it's poorly executed. It feels cheap and now that the silver is flaking off, it looks cheap too.

This is a review of the packaging. And when it comes to DVD's the packaging and transfer are as important as the show itself at least to those of us who care about quality.I am amazed (though I shouldn't be by now) at how much time, effort, and money corporations put into the external packages of DVD sets and how little thought they put into the containers for the DVDs themselves (see Stargate SG1 Box Set...see Milestone I Am Cuba set...see The Wire box set...see the early Buffy and Angel season sets). I guess they assume (probably rightly I am sad to say if comments on Amazon are a guide) that for most consumers a sexy cover is more important than DVD substance. The recent Absolutely Fabulous DVD Complete set proves this point (if further proof is needed) once again.This Absolutely Fabulous box may be ""cool"" and ""sexy"" to some. But for someone like me who cares more about the DVD's than the sexy container it leaves much to be desired. All the DVD's in the set are (unfortunately) packaged in cardboard (very tightly in cardboard I might add) and inevitably get scratched when you try to remove them (quite a task given the tightness of the cardboard holder). Now you may want to spend new money on used looking ""new"" discs but I don't. That is why I will be returning my set to Amazon for a refund and urging consumers out there not to buy this set until WB changes the packaging to something that is more DVD friendly.",1,Bad Packagaing Rears Its Ugly Head (Again)...,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1547,"['not', 'review', 'BBC', 'show', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'purchased', 'set', 'review', 'packaging', 'when', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'transfer', 'are', 'as', 'important', 'show', 'least', 'who', 'care', 'quality.I', 'am', 'amazed', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'now', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'money', 'corporations', 'put', 'external', 'packages', 'DVD', 'sets', 'how', 'little', 'thought', 'put', 'containers', 'DVDs', 'see', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'Box', 'Set', 'see', 'Milestone', 'Am', 'Cuba', 'set', 'see', 'Wire', 'box', 'set', 'see', 'early', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'season', 'sets', 'guess', 'assume', 'probably', 'rightly', 'am', 'sad', 'say', 'comments', 'Amazon', 'are', 'guide', 'most', 'consumers', 'sexy', 'cover', 'more', 'important', 'DVD', 'substance', 'recent', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'DVD', 'Complete', 'set', 'point', 'further', 'proof', 'needed', 'once', 'again.This', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'box', 'may', 'be', 'cool', 'sexy', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'DVD', 'sexy', 'container', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'packaged', 'cardboard', 'very', 'tightly', 'cardboard', 'might', 'add', 'inevitably', 'get', 'scratched', 'when', 'try', 'remove', 'quite', 'task', 'given', 'tightness', 'cardboard', 'holder', 'Now', 'may', 'want', 'spend', 'new', 'money', 'used', 'looking', 'new', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'why', 'will', 'be', 'returning', 'set', 'Amazon', 'refund', 'urging', 'consumers', 'out', 'there', 'not', 'buy', 'set', 'WB', 'packaging', 'something', 'more', 'DVD', 'friendly']",Absolutely Fabulous: Absolutely Everything

1095753,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000UNYPGM,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[3, 3]","Perhaps the greatest British sitcom to ever come out of England, ""Absolutely Fabulous"" has made a name for itself not just in its native homeland, but around the globe, most notably North America, for being an outstanding and extremely funny show. I first came across the series on CBC in Canada when it aired as a late night comedy in the nineties. At first I had a hard time with the English dialect, for some Brits do talk fast and are hard to understand. However, what I realized about the series was its insane humor and I grew to love the show and its sometimes oddball characters. The series is mainly about two best friends, Edina and Patsy, who have a lot of money and who spend their days doing drugs and drinking and enjoying life without worry or care. Edina has a daughter, Saffy, who has inherited the mother role from her parent as she is constantly making sure Edina behaves herself and watches her health. Without a doubt it is Joanna Lumley, who plays Patsy (or Pats) who steals the show. With her Ivanna Trump hair and outrageous clothes sense, Patsy not only is the funniest character but the most campy. Jennifer Saunders (Edina) actually wrote every single episode of the series and to say she is a genius is an understatement. How many stars of hits sitcoms can say they wrote all the show's scripts? This beautiful boxset contains all the episodes of this beloved television classic along with a slew of bonuses including interviews as well as the series' pilot called ""Mirrorball"". There are a few items missing in the boxset including the Comedy Relief scit that Saunders and Lumley did for the BBC in 2005 as well an informative documentary on the series that aired in England. All of the episodes are also available in other releases known as Series Sets. In England some shows refers to their seasons as ""series"". Keep in mind though that in this exclusive boxset some consumers have complained about how the dics are enclosed in tight cardboard leading to the dics becoming scratched. I only wished Warner Brothers would have done a better job in the packaging, but at least the show is availble here for posterity. So, have a glass of wine, light a cigarette, and put on ""Absolutely Fabulous"". You will laugh out silly! One final note: the FOX network bought the show in 2009 and a pilot was filmed with Jennifer Saunders as executive producer and a fall 2009 debut was scheduled, but unfortunately at the last minute the network got cold feet and dropped the series.",5,"""Wine Darrrrrling!",1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,2498,"['Perhaps', 'greatest', 'British', 'sitcom', 'ever', 'come', 'England', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'made', 'name', 'not', 'just', 'native', 'homeland', 'globe', 'most', 'notably', 'North', 'America', 'being', 'outstanding', 'extremely', 'funny', 'show', 'first', 'came', 'series', 'CBC', 'Canada', 'when', 'aired', 'late', 'night', 'comedy', 'nineties', 'first', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'English', 'dialect', 'Brits', 'do', 'talk', 'fast', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', 'However', 'what', 'realized', 'series', 'was', 'insane', 'humor', 'grew', 'love', 'show', 'sometimes', 'oddball', 'characters', 'series', 'mainly', 'about', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Edina', 'Patsy', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'money', 'who', 'spend', 'days', 'doing', 'drugs', 'drinking', 'enjoying', 'life', 'worry', 'care', 'Edina', 'daughter', 'Saffy', 'who', 'inherited', 'mother', 'role', 'parent', 'constantly', 'making', 'sure', 'Edina', 'health', 'doubt', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'who', 'Patsy', 'Pats', 'who', 'show', 'Ivanna', 'Trump', 'hair', 'outrageous', 'clothes', 'sense', 'Patsy', 'not', 'only', 'funniest', 'character', 'most', 'campy', 'Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'Edina', 'actually', 'wrote', 'single', 'episode', 'series', 'say', 'genius', 'understatement', 'How', 'many', 'stars', 'hits', 'sitcoms', 'can', 'say', 'wrote', 'show', 'scripts', 'beautiful', 'boxset', 'episodes', 'beloved', 'television', 'classic', 'slew', 'bonuses', 'including', 'interviews', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'pilot', 'called', 'Mirrorball', 'are', 'few', 'items', 'missing', 'boxset', 'including', 'Comedy', 'Relief', 'scit', 'Saunders', 'Lumley', 'did', 'BBC', '2005', 'as', 'well', 'informative', 'documentary', 'series', 'aired', 'England', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'other', 'releases', 'known', 'Series', 'Sets', 'England', 'shows', 'refers', 'seasons', 'series', 'Keep', 'mind', 'exclusive', 'boxset', 'consumers', 'have', 'complained', 'how', 'dics', 'are', 'enclosed', 'tight', 'cardboard', 'leading', 'dics', 'becoming', 'scratched', 'only', 'wished', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'packaging', 'least', 'show', 'availble', 'here', 'posterity', 'So', 'have', 'glass', 'wine', 'light', 'cigarette', 'put', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'will', 'laugh', 'out', 'silly', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'FOX', 'network', 'bought', 'show', '2009', 'pilot', 'was', 'filmed', 'Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'executive', 'producer', 'fall', '2009', 'debut', 'was', 'scheduled', 'unfortunately', 'last', 'minute', 'network', 'got', 'cold', 'feet', 'dropped', 'series']",Absolutely Fabulous: Absolutely Everything
