1123549,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000ZS8GWQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","As a whole I think that `We Own the Night' works, but to be honest, I don't think that I can really call it a good movie.  The direction (and more specifically the `tone') of the film is clearly the highlight, and this makes up for a lot of the films more obvious weaknesses.  When all was said and done, I have to admit that I was entertained, but reflecting back on the film it is easy to spot all the reasons why this film shouldn't have worked.The plot, for starters, is rather clich&eacute;d.  Someone stated that it was unpredictable, but for me it was clear that this film went in a direction that seemed almost forced and generic, especially with regard to Joaquin Phoenix's character.  Yes, it was shocking when certain characters wound up wounded or dead, and so that I will give to the writers as something commendable, but the films ending was almost ridiculously clich&eacute;d.  The story is that of a wayward child (go figure) Bobby, a young man growing up in a house full of cops of defies is upbringing by working at a nightclub where he keeps his family hidden and cohorts with pretty despicable people.  When his brother, Joe, winds up working narcotics they have a falling out.  Joe wants Bobby to help him nail a drug dealer and Bobby wants Joe to stay away from his club.  When certain tragedies befall the family though, Bobby has a change of heart and decides that it is up to him to snuff out this hazardous drug dealer.The general story is rather basic, but I admit that certain plot points do feel fresh and exciting.  My biggest issue here was the acting, to be honest.  Robert Duvall doesn't really do anything.  He has just a few scenes and none of them are a stretch by any means.  Wahlberg can only play ONE character (unless you consider his stunningly diverse role in `I Heart Huckabees'), and while he plays that character well it gets old very fast.  I really felt like he had an opportunity to play a comfortable character while evoking some deeper emotional responses with this film, and yet he didn't `go there' for me.  It was just a surface Wahlberg performance, just like all the others.  I am a fan of Joaquin Phoenix.  I think that he has range and talent and while he has some usual ticks that he gives almost all of his performances, you can see that he really challenges himself as an actor.  This was not a good challenge for him.  He tries WAY TOO HARD.  His sullen grumpy approach to the character is just too much and comes off far too unrealistic.  I can't really think of one good scene from him, except for maybe the scene where he got arrested and he gives his father this sadistic smile.  There was an arrogance that I really liked about that moment, because it gave the impression that he was `understanding his character'...but that moment came and went and Phoenix fell right back into forced emotional distress.But, I loved Eva Mendes.  Like, really...not only was she BEYOND stunning in this film, but she really understood her character and delivered a provocative look at a woman struggling to find the balance in her ever-changing relationship.Like I said, the direction (or tone) of this film is a saving grace.  Even in the final scenes (that smoke out) where things are rather ridiculous (""be patient!"") there is a tension that is present that really gets under your skin.  It reminded me of the intensity I found in `Gone Baby Gone' (fresh on my mind after a recent review) but thankfully with this particular film the tension to overstay its welcome by continually changing its direction.  I can't bring myself to give this anything more than a C+, but that's a highly recommended C+.  Regardless of the fact that this film isn't really `good', it is certainly entertaining, and sometimes that is all you need.",3,"An entertaining, yet underwhelming, night at the movies...",1265155200,"02 3, 2010",2010,3779,"['whole', 'think', 'Own', 'Night', 'works', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'really', 'call', 'good', 'movie', 'direction', 'more', 'specifically', 'tone', 'film', 'clearly', 'highlight', 'up', 'lot', 'films', 'more', 'obvious', 'weaknesses', 'When', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'entertained', 'reflecting', 'back', 'film', 'easy', 'spot', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked.The', 'plot', 'starters', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Someone', 'stated', 'was', 'unpredictable', 'was', 'clear', 'film', 'went', 'direction', 'seemed', 'almost', 'forced', 'generic', 'especially', 'regard', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'character', 'Yes', 'was', 'shocking', 'when', 'certain', 'characters', 'wound', 'up', 'wounded', 'dead', 'so', 'will', 'give', 'writers', 'something', 'commendable', 'films', 'ending', 'was', 'almost', 'ridiculously', 'clich', 'eacute', 'story', 'wayward', 'child', 'go', 'figure', 'Bobby', 'young', 'man', 'growing', 'up', 'house', 'full', 'cops', 'defies', 'upbringing', 'working', 'nightclub', 'where', 'family', 'hidden', 'cohorts', 'pretty', 'despicable', 'people', 'When', 'brother', 'Joe', 'up', 'working', 'narcotics', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'Joe', 'Bobby', 'help', 'nail', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Bobby', 'Joe', 'stay', 'away', 'club', 'When', 'certain', 'tragedies', 'befall', 'family', 'Bobby', 'change', 'heart', 'up', 'snuff', 'out', 'hazardous', 'drug', 'general', 'story', 'rather', 'basic', 'admit', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'do', 'feel', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'biggest', 'issue', 'here', 'was', 'acting', 'be', 'honest', 'Robert', 'Duvall', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'none', 'are', 'stretch', 'means', 'Wahlberg', 'can', 'only', 'play', 'ONE', 'character', 'consider', 'stunningly', 'diverse', 'role', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'character', 'well', 'old', 'very', 'fast', 'really', 'felt', 'had', 'opportunity', 'play', 'comfortable', 'character', 'evoking', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'responses', 'film', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'was', 'just', 'surface', 'Wahlberg', 'performance', 'just', 'others', 'am', 'fan', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'think', 'range', 'talent', 'usual', 'ticks', 'almost', 'performances', 'can', 'see', 'really', 'actor', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'challenge', 'WAY', 'TOO', 'HARD', 'sullen', 'grumpy', 'approach', 'character', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'off', 'far', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'one', 'good', 'scene', 'maybe', 'scene', 'where', 'got', 'arrested', 'father', 'sadistic', 'smile', 'was', 'arrogance', 'really', 'liked', 'moment', 'gave', 'impression', 'was', 'understanding', 'character', 'moment', 'came', 'went', 'Phoenix', 'fell', 'right', 'back', 'forced', 'emotional', 'distress.But', 'loved', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'really', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'BEYOND', 'stunning', 'film', 'really', 'understood', 'character', 'delivered', 'provocative', 'look', 'woman', 'struggling', 'find', 'balance', 'ever-changing', 'relationship.Like', 'said', 'direction', 'tone', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'Even', 'final', 'scenes', 'out', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'be', 'patient', 'tension', 'present', 'really', 'skin', 'reminded', 'intensity', 'found', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'fresh', 'mind', 'recent', 'review', 'thankfully', 'particular', 'film', 'tension', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'continually', 'changing', 'direction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'give', 'anything', 'more', 'C+', 'highly', 'recommended', 'C+', 'Regardless', 'fact', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'need']",We Own the Night

1123551,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000ZS8GWQ,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[7, 8]","James Gray's 1980s paean of a NYC family of cops vs. the Russian mob, ""We Own the Night"" refreshingly doesn't portray policemen as crooked or amoral, but, despite the star power involved, never achieves greatness, either. Sadly, the plot is predictable, and the climax, contrived.This is not to say the film hasn't merit; Joaquin Phoenix, as the 'black sheep' son who dabbles in 'the dark side' before becoming an 'avenging angel' cop, is superb, as is Eva Mendes, who, for once, is allowed to show more depth than her usual 'window dressing' roles. Robert Duvall demonstrates a restraint in his 'father' role that has been missing in most of his recent work, losing the Southern twang for the crisp diction reminiscent of his earlier films. Surprisingly, Mark Wahlberg, in a more 'straight arrow' variation of his character in ""The Departed"", has little to do, and is completely upstaged by the flashier Phoenix, as well as by his Russian counterparts, the kindly father figure with a secret life (Moni Moshonov), and his ruthless drug lord nephew (Alex Veadov).The film starts promisingly, with a flashy vision of Manhattan club life of the late 80s, run by the Russians, who are taking control of drug trafficking, and hold the NYPD in contempt and disregard, juxtaposed against the simpler, traditional world of New York's Finest, celebrating achievement, duty, and service to others. Phoenix, as the 'adopted' son of the Russians, and the actual son of a cop, is at the nexus of what might have been great drama, as he straddles both worlds. Yet when the film's first major climax occurs, the opportunity is lost, as he makes a decision that channels the film along a predictable path that offers few surprises.Still entertaining, but far less than it might have been, ""We Own the Night"" is a good film that could have been great...",3,"Excellent Cast, Routine Plot...",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,1837,"['James', 'Gray', '1980s', 'paean', 'NYC', 'family', 'cops', 'Russian', 'mob', 'Own', 'Night', 'refreshingly', ""n't"", 'portray', 'policemen', 'crooked', 'amoral', 'star', 'power', 'involved', 'never', 'greatness', 'either', 'Sadly', 'plot', 'predictable', 'climax', 'contrived.This', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'merit', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', ""'black"", 'sheep', 'son', 'who', ""'the"", 'dark', 'side', 'becoming', ""'avenging"", 'angel', 'cop', 'superb', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'who', 'once', 'allowed', 'show', 'more', 'depth', 'usual', ""'window"", 'dressing', 'roles', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'restraint', ""'father"", 'role', 'been', 'missing', 'most', 'recent', 'work', 'losing', 'Southern', 'twang', 'crisp', 'diction', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'films', 'Surprisingly', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'more', ""'straight"", 'arrow', 'variation', 'character', 'Departed', 'little', 'do', 'completely', 'upstaged', 'flashier', 'Phoenix', 'as', 'well', 'Russian', 'counterparts', 'kindly', 'father', 'figure', 'secret', 'life', 'Moni', 'Moshonov', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'lord', 'nephew', 'Alex', 'Veadov', '.The', 'film', 'promisingly', 'flashy', 'vision', 'Manhattan', 'club', 'life', 'late', '80s', 'run', 'Russians', 'who', 'are', 'taking', 'control', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'hold', 'NYPD', 'contempt', 'disregard', 'juxtaposed', 'simpler', 'traditional', 'world', 'New', 'York', 'Finest', 'celebrating', 'achievement', 'duty', 'service', 'others', 'Phoenix', ""'adopted"", 'son', 'Russians', 'actual', 'son', 'cop', 'nexus', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'drama', 'worlds', 'when', 'film', 'first', 'major', 'climax', 'opportunity', 'lost', 'decision', 'film', 'predictable', 'path', 'few', 'surprises.Still', 'entertaining', 'far', 'less', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Own', 'Night', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great']",We Own the Night

1123557,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000ZS8GWQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 8]","""We Own the Night"" may not be the most original cop movie ever made, but it certainly is compelling. Taking place between late 1988 and mid 1989, it tells a classically redemptive story, putting all its effort into the main character and his transition from bad to good. But I'm making this sound far too simple: Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix) is really not a bad guy at all. Misguided, certainly--he's established as the manager of a New York City nightclub, and as such, he's a freewheeling partier. But more importantly, he's detached himself from his immediate family, going so far as to use his mother's last name for business purposes. Instead, he chooses to connect with the club's Russian owner, Marat Buzhayev (Moni Moshonov). Understandably, this puts Green at odds with his father, Burt Grusinsky (Robert Duvall), and his brother, Joseph (Mark Wahlberg), both of whom are cops.I think you can see the conflict here, but wait until the story really gets going. It begins when Buzhayev's nephew, Vadim (Alex Veadov), is suspected of drug trafficking; under Joseph's supervision, the police raid the club and arrest Vadim. This sets into motion a series of events that endanger the Grusinsky family, beginning with Joseph's attempted murder. While Joseph recovers in the hospital, Bobby feels the first pangs of remorse; no, he didn't get along with his family, but he never wanted to see any of them get hurt. For the first time in his life, he actually feels responsible for someone else's misfortune. He channels his pain into a plan of attack, resolving to catch Vadim and have him brought to justice. This can be seen in one of two ways: either Bobby is trying to relieve his own guilt, or he's actually hoping to redeem himself by being selfless. Quite possibly, it's a little bit of both.But whatever his reasons, it quickly becomes clear that catching Vadim will not be so easy. Through a sting-gone-wrong, he learns of Bobby's involvement with the NYPD, meaning that Bobby is now forced to go into hiding. So is his girlfriend, Amada (Eva Mendes), the only person Bobby trusts with his family secrets. She clearly loves him, but she also finds it difficult to move from motel to motel and to avoid any contact with her mother. They're both trapped, but Amada has it worse simply because she's a victim of circumstance. Bobby, on the other hand, got himself into this situation, first when he refused to help the police keep tabs on Vadim, second when willingly chose to help the police. I don't know whether or not we're supposed to feel sorry for Bobby--that depends on what the viewer believes. But I do know that, as reckless as he was, he's at least trying to make a difference. Surely something can be said for that.But maybe it isn't enough. ""We Own the Night"" presents a number of complicated, believable issues that are properly introduced but not entirely developed. The tension between the Grusinskys is understandable, given Bobby's rebellious behavior. But in any troubled relationship, behavior is only part of the problem. As fascinating as these characters were, I just know that they could have been much more realistic if given the chance--with just a little more development, they could have been deeper, more meaningful, more complex. I recognized Bobby's drive to right his wrongs, and while that aspect of the story is fairly unoriginal, I still appreciated it. But something more was needed, something solid enough to be realistic yet flexible enough to be entertaining. This film remains stuck in an area between the two, an area bogged down by routine material.But at the very least, it does the best it can with that material, and ultimately accomplishes what it set out to accomplish. I did believe in these characters, and I definitely found their story interesting. More significantly, I longed for some kind of resolution, which I'm sure is what the filmmakers were hoping for. Beneath the violence, the hurtful words, and the hard feelings, there is an air of hope to this story. We want everything to turn out okay, simply because Bobby and Joseph are family, and family should always stick together. Or at least, they should in this kind of film.As flawed as this movie is, it's still worth recommending. ""We Own the Night"" is a police drama about taking responsibility, whether it's for your own actions or for someone else's well being. I'm not nave enough to think that this message is new. Obviously, it isn't. But I am easy-going enough to believe that it still works. And while the characters aren't as developed as they should be, there's still enough to keep them from being flat, shallow, and uninteresting. I could sense how badly this film wanted to connect with its audience; the plot was in a perpetual state of building, working itself up to an ending that would be both expected and appropriate. Generally speaking, it succeeded--the final lines of dialogue express what should have been expressed from the very start, which is not only satisfying, but necessary, as well.",4,Am I My Brother's

There are some elements that are borrowed from other films like The Departed and even Mean Streets. But while this crime drama is a bit unoriginal, I can't help but like it. It's one of the better films I've seen in 2007, and it's got a whole lot of things in store. First off, it's not your typical Hollywood atmosphere, where there are quick shots and loud background music. It's a very violent and sometimes eerie setting, and it's almost perfect for late 80's Brooklyn. The orchestral music is tranquil, which is a break from all the loudness and bombast from other Hollywood action music. The pace is slower, which is a good thing since you're able to absorb and understand the characters, and why they are the way they are. The action is never in-your-face, mainly because the story is the main focus here, not the action. The only flaw I found in We Own The Night is the climax. I expected a more satisfying final confrontation, but it didn't really turn out as I expected it to be. Still, it's a very good film. It's got a fascinating plot and some memorable performances from Phoenix, Wahlberg, Duvall, and Mendes.

Joe Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg): the other son Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix) did not follow the family tradition of police work but instead is involved in nightclubs - and yes there is a schism  of resentment.  Bobby has distanced himself further from his family by changing his last name to 'Green', living with a Puerto Rican girl Amada (Eva Mendes), and bonding to a wealthy Russian family who owns the nightclub where Bobby works - a front for a drug dealing business. Writer/Director James Gray ('The Yards' and 'Little Odessa') has a feel for this underbelly of New York City and captures the 1988 mood of life in the city and beneath the city with style.  The problem with the story is that it has been done so many times that it is simply stale yesterday's lunch.  Two brothers at opposite end of the family spectrum require a major tragedy to bring them together, and to offer any more information to this fairly thin plot would be a disservice to those who plan to see the film.The cast is strong, partly because each of them has played similar roles countless times and have the ideas down pat.  It should be noted that two of the producers of the film are Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix, probably a reason the film was made...  There are some exciting moments and enough surprises and tense times to keep the adrenaline rolling, the smaller roles are very well cast, and one of the shining attributes of the film is the gorgeous Russian liturgy inspired musical score by Wojciech Kilar.

Just a normal ""New York cops versus gangsters"" flick, imagine a cross of the Departed and Eastern Promises.We all know that in the 90s, Mr.Giuliani singlehandedly and famously cleaned up NYC (unless it really happened differently, eg via the mechanisms mentioned in Freakonomics). Before his magic touch saved the city, it appears that NY cops were the laughing stock of the streets. Gangsters were in control, it seems.What we have here, set in 88, is a confrontation between a Russian drug ring and the cops, among whom the father and son team Duvall/Wahlberg is prominent. They have a prodigal son/brother (Phoenix), who happens to work as a night club manager for the Russians and has a Latina girl friend (Mendes). You see right away where this is leading, but then, no, you don't quite. The script succeeds in avoiding overdone predictability.

The manager of an up-and-coming nightclub, Bobby spends his nights boozing and drugging with his friends and spending time with his girlfriend Amanda. What everyone in his inner circle doesn't know is that Bobby's father is the chief of police, and his brother is a captain assigned to head up a new narcotics team that is gunning for a Russian drug dealer--who happens to be the nephew of Bobby's boss. When his family asks Bobby to help them bring down a dealer, Bobby has to decide if his family is more important than his future... and his choice will affect everyone around him.We Own The Night has got some great scenes, but the things that are good about it are overshadowed by the mediocre acting from a cast I expected more from. Mark Wahlberg, who plays Bobby's brother, is pretty much the same character I've seen him play for the last three years, Joaquin Phoenix can't seem to shake his tendency to act like Johnny Cash, and Eva Mendes just sits around and looks pretty--but she does it so well. We Own The Night has nothing new to offer the oversaturated market of nightclub mob/crime/cop dramas. If you've seen 54, Boogie Nights, Mystic River, or even The Departed you've seen aspects of this film done in a more cohesive and artful manner.

1123585,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000ZS8GWQ,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","I recently watched director James Gray's previous filmThe Yardsthat teamed Joaquin Phoenix & Mark Wahlberg.  I decided to rent ""We Own the Night"" and remembered as the first frames fluttered that I'd seen this as a theatrical release.  Of Gray's four films, three star Phoenix.  It was interesting to hear in the DVD extras how Gray finds Phoenix difficult to work with because he wants to know in such detail what is motivating the character.  Gray says that while he has to spend extra time with Phoenix, the results are superb.  Phoenix keeps meticulous track of the story line as shots are filmed out of sequence.Phoenix recently had an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line"" as well as earning a Golden Globe.  As Bobby Green, the film begins with a torrid love scene with Eva Mendes.  It is so steamy that even though the pair mostly keep their clothes on, we feel like we've intruded on a very personal moment in their lives.  Phoenix maintains his intensity throughout.Eva Mendes plays Bobby's girlfriend Amada.  While she was in ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"" she blossoms in this role, showing great depth as an actress.  The harrowing violence that swirls around their relationship becomes too much for her.  She shares in the DVD extras about how she felt like a real partner in creating the role with James Gray & playing the scenes with Phoenix.Mark Wahlberg plays Bobby's brother, Lt. Joseph Grusinsky.  Wahlberg also contrasts his style of show up & shoot to Phoenix's studied approach.  While Wahlberg doesn't achieve the depth, he is versatile in handling the anger, jealousy & love for family.  The very understated ending where each brother whispers to the other that they love each other while on a stage receiving commendations is as underplayed as it is powerful.Robert Duvall plays their father Bert Grusinsky with his trademark stoic intensity.  Phoenix shares how when he talked to the costumer, he wanted to wear things that were sure to upset the father.  The suggestion of an earring seemed perfect.  When Phoenix showed on set wearing it, Duval razzed him about it, perfect for the characters' conflict.Danny Hoch plays Green's best friend Jumbo Falsetti.  While Hoch has paid his dues in a number of smaller roles on screen, he blossoms here as the pudgy buddy whose friendship is conditioned by opportunism and spiced by betrayal.  The confrontation scene between Bobby & Jumbo was shot outdoors in 9 degree weather, with Gray sliding in a secret direction to Hoch to play belligerent, which set the fuse of Phoenix's anger.  It's riveting to watch.In smaller roles, Alex Veadov who was in ""Return of the Living Dead 4"" plays the Russian drug czar Vadim.  His chilling coldness and suave assurance play well to his final bloody moments.  Oleg Taktarov who plays in many Russian films does a great job as the protective bodyguard Pavel Lubyarsky who distrusts Green.  Tony Musante who was also in ""The Yards"" does a journeyman's job as police Capt. Jack Shapiro.Moni Moshonov that I saw in a great foreign filmLate Marriageplays Marat Bujayev who owns the Cafe Caribbe where Green works and turns out to put special additives into the furs he imports into the country.  Gray recounts how one of the final scenes where Bobby emerges from a fire was shot as thunder boomed in a darkening sky.  About 30 seconds after Gray yelled cut, the sky disgorged a deluge, perfect timing that Gray relishes as his favorite moment on the shoot.I found the film extremely affecting.  I like the character-based drama.  Although there is plenty of action, the story is moved by seeing how it affects the characters.  The DVD extra on filming the car chase was quite interesting.  Both ""The Yards"" & this film show a gritty realism that is fashioned by Gray's guiding hand.  It's excellent film.

After a tremendous performance as Johnny Cash in WALK THE LINE, Phoenix returns to the screen in this drama about a family of policemen in New York.Phoenix stars as Bobby Green, a laid back manager of the hottest new nightclub in New York, 1988. The club is doing well, the owners are pleased and they're in talks with Bobby to open a new club as well, possibly in Manhattan.At the same time Bobby's family, father Deputy Chief Albert Grusinsky and brother Capt. Joe Grusinsky, are heading up a drug task force to stop the influx of drugs into the city. Their prime target just happens to be the nephew of the club's owner, a low life Russian mafia member named Vadim (Alex Veadov). When the pair approaches Bobby about helping them get information, he turns them down, more involved in his own party style of living than their reality based one.All that changes in one night. After arresting Vadim at the club, Joe is shot point blank in the face by friends of Vadim. Bobby realizes there is a price to pay with whichever path you choose in life and approaches one of his father's friends about going undercover.The set up is made, the bust goes down but Vadim later escapes from jail. Now in witness protection, Bobby must do his best to survive. But an attempt on his life results in repercussions that change Bobby more than even the attempt on his brother.It would be easy to say that this film is about a group of policemen versus the Russian mob but that would be too simple. You could say its all about a family trying to come to grips with different paths taken. But the fact is these two points are merely the tip of the iceberg. The real story here is the journey of one young man down a path he doesn't necessarily choose for himself.Bobby Green (his mother's maiden name) is a flawed hero, a man who is chased by demons that result indirectly from the choices he makes. It's a journey that he makes attempting to correct the results of those mistakes. And it's a trip that affects not only his life but the lives of those around him.Phoenix plays to perfection here, showing the playful side of Bobby Green that evolves into a responsible adult. Growing up is not easy and that is painfully apparent in the change in this character. Wahlberg does a stand up job as well with a smaller part. Joe is the grown up brother who ends up not being all that he wants to be. Duvall? Is there any role that this man cannot nail down?As the film neared its end I thought, well I'm not sure this one is a good one. But it stuck with me. And the more I thought about it, the more layers I peeled back while reflecting upon it, the better it became. When all is said and done, this is a film filled with solid storytelling and performances that contribute to the whole. It's definitely one worth seeking out.",4,A FAMILY AFFAIR,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,2884,"['Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'becoming', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'acting', 'field', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', 'Phoenix', 'screen', 'drama', 'family', 'policemen', 'New', 'York.Phoenix', 'Bobby', 'Green', 'laid', 'back', 'manager', 'hottest', 'new', 'nightclub', 'New', 'York', '1988', 'club', 'doing', 'well', 'owners', 'are', 'pleased', ""'re"", 'talks', 'Bobby', 'open', 'new', 'club', 'as', 'well', 'possibly', 'Manhattan.At', 'same', 'time', 'Bobby', 'family', 'father', 'Deputy', 'Chief', 'Albert', 'Grusinsky', 'brother', 'Capt', 'Joe', 'Grusinsky', 'are', 'heading', 'up', 'drug', 'task', 'force', 'stop', 'influx', 'drugs', 'city', 'prime', 'target', 'just', 'be', 'nephew', 'club', 'owner', 'low', 'life', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'member', 'named', 'Vadim', 'Alex', 'Veadov', 'When', 'pair', 'Bobby', 'helping', 'get', 'information', 'down', 'more', 'involved', 'own', 'party', 'style', 'living', 'reality', 'based', 'changes', 'one', 'night', 'arresting', 'Vadim', 'club', 'Joe', 'shot', 'point', 'blank', 'face', 'friends', 'Vadim', 'Bobby', 'realizes', 'price', 'pay', 'whichever', 'path', 'choose', 'life', 'one', 'father', 'friends', 'going', 'undercover.The', 'set', 'up', 'made', 'bust', 'down', 'Vadim', 'later', 'jail', 'Now', 'witness', 'protection', 'Bobby', 'must', 'do', 'best', 'survive', 'attempt', 'life', 'results', 'repercussions', 'change', 'Bobby', 'more', 'even', 'attempt', 'brother.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'say', 'film', 'group', 'policemen', 'Russian', 'mob', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'simple', 'could', 'say', 'family', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'different', 'paths', 'taken', 'fact', 'two', 'points', 'are', 'merely', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'journey', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'down', 'path', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'choose', 'himself.Bobby', 'Green', 'mother', 'maiden', 'name', 'flawed', 'hero', 'man', 'who', 'chased', 'demons', 'result', 'indirectly', 'choices', 'journey', 'attempting', 'correct', 'results', 'mistakes', 'trip', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'lives', 'him.Phoenix', 'plays', 'perfection', 'here', 'showing', 'playful', 'side', 'Bobby', 'Green', 'responsible', 'adult', 'Growing', 'up', 'not', 'easy', 'painfully', 'apparent', 'change', 'character', 'Wahlberg', 'stand', 'up', 'job', 'well', 'smaller', 'part', 'Joe', 'grown', 'up', 'brother', 'who', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'be', 'Duvall', 'there', 'role', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'nail', 'down', 'film', 'neared', 'end', 'thought', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'stuck', 'more', 'thought', 'more', 'layers', 'peeled', 'back', 'reflecting', 'better', 'became', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'film', 'filled', 'solid', 'storytelling', 'performances', 'contribute', 'whole', 'definitely', 'one', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out']",We Own the Night

1123594,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000ZS8GWQ,Mike Zimmerman,"[5, 6]","In New York circa 1988, the Russian mafia have made it overseas to begin their drug-dealing business. Thrown into the mix is Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix), an upstart club owner looking to make it out of Brooklyn and begin a good life with his girlfriend Amada Juarez (Eva Mendez). However, when his estranged family, cops Joseph (Mark Wahlberg) and Burt Grusinsky (Robert Duvall), conduct a raid on his club, druglord and hitman Vadim Nezhinski (Alex Veadov) begins putting prices on the NYPD's head, which leaves Joseph in the hospital from a gun wound. Because of what happened, Bobby agrees in becoming an informant to the police, but can he do it without putting whom he loves in danger or, more importantly, himself?""We Own the Night"" may look like an action-packed crime thriller for the salacious hounds to eat up (and I'm one of them), but not according to director James Gray. Recalling the classic police dramas of the '70s (right down to the poster you'll see outside your nearest cineplex), it does have action, but the majority of the picture deals with familial bonds, making difficult choices, and sacrifice. Gray, familiar with these thematic elements of ""The Yards"" (this film is basically a follow up with Wahlberg and Phoenix back together), doesn't disappoint, making this wannabe ""The Departed"" clone one of the most endearing surprises.This is due to Joaquin Phoenix. His first film since breaking huge with ""Walk the Line"" back in 2005, Phoenix never goes overboard to shove in our faces that this film is a drama. He's able to make us relate to Bobby, and easily makes the character's decent into depression and despair work easily. As a matter of fact, this is more his movie than it is his and Mark Wahlberg's (still coming on strong post-The Departed), as the co-star hardly appears in the second half, leaving the majority of the action focused on Phoenix, though he gets good complements from Wahlberg, Robert Duvall, and Eva Mendes. It's impressive work from these actors.""We Own the Night"" does have its share of action, but since Gray is more focused with the meatier material, it's more subdued than slam-bang Hollywood actioners of late. There are three, which include a firefight inside a warehouse where cocaine is made, a ""French Connection""-style car chase down a heavily-percipitated street, and a suspenseful foot chase inside a smoke-filled cornfield. Gray even furthers his inspiration from the classic police dramas by mostly having the sound effects do his work instead of setting them to a bombastic soundtrack.Gray sort of robs the film of true potential by increasing its mood of depression for a crowd-pleasing moment of sentimentality with the cliched staploe of killing of a family member, then having Bobby and Amada get into an angry spat that puts a damper on the sweet by-play they had earlier. Regardless, that can easily be forgiven with Phoenix and/or Wahlberg's magnetic presences, and that aforementioned foot chase. And get this: no plot twists for the sake of plot twists. You really can't ask for anything better than that, honestly.",5,"""You can't piss your pants and stay warm for long.""",1192147200,"10 12, 2007",2007,3096,"['New', 'York', 'circa', '1988', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'have', 'made', 'overseas', 'begin', 'drug-dealing', 'business', 'Thrown', 'mix', 'Bobby', 'Green', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'upstart', 'club', 'owner', 'looking', 'make', 'Brooklyn', 'begin', 'good', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'Amada', 'Juarez', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'However', 'when', 'estranged', 'family', 'cops', 'Joseph', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Burt', 'Grusinsky', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'conduct', 'raid', 'club', 'druglord', 'hitman', 'Vadim', 'Nezhinski', 'Alex', 'Veadov', 'putting', 'prices', 'NYPD', 'head', 'Joseph', 'hospital', 'gun', 'wound', 'what', 'happened', 'Bobby', 'becoming', 'informant', 'police', 'can', 'do', 'putting', 'whom', 'danger', 'more', 'importantly', 'Own', 'Night', 'may', 'look', 'action-packed', 'crime', 'thriller', 'salacious', 'hounds', 'eat', 'up', ""'m"", 'one', 'not', 'according', 'director', 'James', 'Gray', 'Recalling', 'classic', 'police', 'dramas', ""'70s"", 'right', 'down', 'poster', ""'ll"", 'see', 'nearest', 'cineplex', 'have', 'action', 'majority', 'picture', 'familial', 'bonds', 'making', 'difficult', 'choices', 'sacrifice', 'Gray', 'familiar', 'thematic', 'elements', 'Yards', 'film', 'basically', 'follow', 'up', 'Wahlberg', 'Phoenix', 'back', 'together', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'making', 'wannabe', 'Departed', 'clone', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'surprises.This', 'due', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'first', 'film', 'breaking', 'huge', 'Walk', 'Line', 'back', '2005', 'Phoenix', 'never', 'overboard', 'shove', 'film', 'drama', 'able', 'make', 'relate', 'Bobby', 'easily', 'character', 'decent', 'depression', 'despair', 'work', 'easily', 'matter', 'fact', 'more', 'movie', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'still', 'coming', 'strong', 'post-The', 'Departed', 'co-star', 'hardly', 'second', 'half', 'leaving', 'majority', 'action', 'focused', 'Phoenix', 'good', 'complements', 'Wahlberg', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'impressive', 'work', 'actors', 'Own', 'Night', 'have', 'share', 'action', 'Gray', 'more', 'focused', 'meatier', 'material', 'more', 'subdued', 'slam-bang', 'Hollywood', 'actioners', 'late', 'are', 'three', 'include', 'firefight', 'warehouse', 'where', 'cocaine', 'made', 'French', 'Connection', '-style', 'car', 'chase', 'down', 'heavily-percipitated', 'street', 'suspenseful', 'foot', 'chase', 'smoke-filled', 'cornfield', 'Gray', 'even', 'inspiration', 'classic', 'police', 'dramas', 'mostly', 'having', 'sound', 'effects', 'do', 'work', 'instead', 'setting', 'bombastic', 'soundtrack.Gray', 'sort', 'robs', 'film', 'true', 'potential', 'increasing', 'mood', 'depression', 'crowd-pleasing', 'moment', 'sentimentality', 'cliched', 'staploe', 'killing', 'family', 'member', 'then', 'having', 'Bobby', 'Amada', 'get', 'angry', 'spat', 'damper', 'sweet', 'by-play', 'had', 'earlier', 'Regardless', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Phoenix', 'and/or', 'Wahlberg', 'magnetic', 'presences', 'aforementioned', 'foot', 'chase', 'get', 'plot', 'sake', 'plot', 'twists', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'anything', 'better', 'honestly']",We Own the Night

But this life is coming to an end so another life can be born. (Back to what I was discussing above)Bobby is then called away to go to his brother's party, his brother Joseph Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg) is being promoted to Captain of the New York Police Force, and it turns out that Joe is starting up a new narcotics case so they can track down the person who is supplying a large quantity of drugs to the streets of New York City. The suspect they have is one Vadim Nezhinski(Alex Veadov) nephew of Marat Buzhayev and Vadims' prime location is the bar Bonny works in. His father Burt Grusinsky(Robert Duvall),who is the Chief of Police, is telling him that soon he will have to make a choice that ""soon you will either be with us or you'll be with the drug dealers"".Bobby has been keeping this secret (his family being Law Enforcement Officials) a secret so he can easily live his life as a neutral in the conflict but this comes to an end when the police do a raid on the bar arresting multiple people including a man who is working for Vadim. This causes Vadim to place a hit out on anyone (cops or ""rats"") who are directly involved with this case. Vadim sends his hitmen after Joseph first, the hitman nearlly kills Joseph when he shoots him in the jaw with a 9mm handgun, but when Bobby finds out he decides it is time to take action before more people die and goes undercover as an informant for the police.Vadim meets up with Bobby at a diner and invited him to sample his product and help promote it, to which Bobby tells to the cops. The police give him a wire hidden inside of a zippo lighter and give his a ""signal word"" that he should say if he thinks they are onto him, Bobby decides to use ""Feather"" as his word as goes to Vadims' operation. When Bobby is there he soon starts to panic and loses his cool and his cover is blown, but not before he can use is call word.After an intense and very dramatic shoot out between Law Enforcement and Drug Dealers Vadim is arrested and Bobby is placed in protective custody. Him and his girlfriend must now law low until the trial, but Vadim escapes prison before that happens and Bobby's brother has made a full recovery by this point and is now back on the case. So Bobby is to be moved to another hotel and is attacked before he can reach the next hotel resulting in the death of Bobby's father.Bobby then decides that he must make his fight against the crooks more official and joins the police force, he then decides he wants to meet up with his friend Jumbo Falsetti (Danny Hoch). As they have a discussion, Jumbo lets slip that he knew which hotel they (Bobby and Amada) were staying at. Bobby interrogates him and finds out that the person prying Jumbo for the information is none other than Marat Buzhayev. We then cut to Bobby and Joseph talking to everyone else involved that they need to know where this ""next big deal is going down"" and they figure that it will be at an abandoned horse riding academy.The Police then show up and are able to stop the deal, arrest Marat Buzhayev, and Bobby is able to kill Vadim.We then see in the next scene Bobby is being promoted to a Lieutenant for the NYPD, the brothers sit there and listen to the speech as it fades to black.This movie is such a delight to watch because the acting is convincing, there is real drama there, and you constantly entertained whether it be suspense, action, or drama that keeps you asking for more.A recommended purchase from me and a 5/5",5,What a great drama/Action!,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,4153,"['movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'when', 'movie', 'are', 'greeted', 'series', 'NYC', 'cops', 'pictures', 'taking', 'place', 'rougly', ""1940's-1970"", 'then', 'are', 'greeted', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Bobby', 'Greene', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Amada', 'Juarez', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'also', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'setting', 'movie', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1988', 'Bobby', 'managing', 'bar', 'boss', 'Marat', 'Buzhayev', 'Moni', 'Moshonov', 'discussing', 'success', 'bar', 'how', 'happy', 'be', 'running', 'it.We', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'life', 'Bobby', 'Greene', 'life', 'party', 'animal', 'who', 'pot', 'cigarettes', 'drinks', 'as', 'much', 'party', 'animal', 'cocaine', 'life', 'coming', 'end', 'so', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'born', 'Back', 'what', 'was', 'discussing', 'Bobby', 'then', 'called', 'away', 'go', 'brother', 'party', 'brother', 'Joseph', 'Grusinsky', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'being', 'promoted', 'Captain', 'New', 'York', 'Police', 'Force', 'out', 'Joe', 'starting', 'up', 'new', 'narcotics', 'case', 'can', 'track', 'down', 'person', 'who', 'supplying', 'large', 'quantity', 'drugs', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'suspect', 'have', 'one', 'Vadim', 'Nezhinski', 'Alex', 'Veadov', 'nephew', 'Marat', 'Buzhayev', 'Vadims', 'prime', 'location', 'bar', 'Bonny', 'father', 'Burt', 'Grusinsky', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'Chief', 'Police', 'telling', 'soon', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'choice', 'soon', 'will', 'either', 'be', ""'ll"", 'be', 'drug', 'dealers', '.Bobby', 'been', 'keeping', 'secret', 'family', 'being', 'Law', 'Enforcement', 'Officials', 'secret', 'can', 'easily', 'live', 'life', 'neutral', 'conflict', 'end', 'when', 'police', 'do', 'raid', 'bar', 'arresting', 'multiple', 'people', 'including', 'man', 'who', 'working', 'Vadim', 'Vadim', 'place', 'hit', 'out', 'anyone', 'rats', 'who', 'are', 'directly', 'involved', 'case', 'Vadim', 'hitmen', 'Joseph', 'first', 'hitman', 'nearlly', 'Joseph', 'when', 'shoots', 'jaw', '9mm', 'handgun', 'when', 'Bobby', 'out', 'time', 'take', 'action', 'more', 'people', 'die', 'undercover', 'informant', 'police.Vadim', 'up', 'Bobby', 'diner', 'invited', 'sample', 'product', 'help', 'promote', 'Bobby', 'cops', 'police', 'give', 'wire', 'hidden', 'inside', 'zippo', 'lighter', 'give', 'signal', 'word', 'should', 'say', 'are', 'Bobby', 'use', 'Feather', 'word', 'Vadims', 'operation', 'When', 'Bobby', 'there', 'soon', 'panic', 'cool', 'cover', 'blown', 'not', 'can', 'use', 'call', 'word.After', 'intense', 'very', 'dramatic', 'shoot', 'out', 'Law', 'Enforcement', 'Drug', 'Dealers', 'Vadim', 'arrested', 'Bobby', 'placed', 'protective', 'custody', 'Him', 'girlfriend', 'must', 'now', 'law', 'low', 'trial', 'Vadim', 'prison', 'Bobby', 'brother', 'made', 'full', 'recovery', 'point', 'now', 'back', 'case', 'So', 'Bobby', 'be', 'moved', 'hotel', 'attacked', 'can', 'reach', 'next', 'hotel', 'resulting', 'death', 'Bobby', 'father.Bobby', 'then', 'must', 'make', 'fight', 'crooks', 'more', 'official', 'police', 'force', 'then', 'meet', 'up', 'friend', 'Jumbo', 'Falsetti', 'Danny', 'Hoch', 'have', 'discussion', 'Jumbo', 'slip', 'knew', 'hotel', 'Bobby', 'Amada', 'were', 'staying', 'Bobby', 'out', 'person', 'prying', 'Jumbo', 'information', 'none', 'other', 'Marat', 'Buzhayev', 'then', 'cut', 'Bobby', 'Joseph', 'talking', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'need', 'know', 'where', 'next', 'big', 'deal', 'going', 'down', 'figure', 'will', 'be', 'abandoned', 'horse', 'riding', 'academy.The', 'Police', 'then', 'show', 'up', 'are', 'able', 'stop', 'deal', 'arrest', 'Marat', 'Buzhayev', 'Bobby', 'able', 'kill', 'Vadim.We', 'then', 'see', 'next', 'scene', 'Bobby', 'being', 'promoted', 'Lieutenant', 'NYPD', 'brothers', 'sit', 'there', 'listen', 'speech', 'black.This', 'movie', 'such', 'delight', 'watch', 'acting', 'convincing', 'real', 'drama', 'there', 'constantly', 'entertained', 'be', 'suspense', 'action', 'drama', 'asking', 'more.A', 'recommended', 'purchase', '5/5']",We Own the Night

We Own the Night is defiantly, refreshingly unhip."" Peter TraversA movie that does not have original material, but it works in spurts. Thedark underworld of Russian crime- this is the group du jour of crime nowadays. The New York City Police Department who in the 1980's according to Roger Ebert used the 'We Own the Night"" slogan of the New York police, painted on the sides of their squad cars as a promise to take back the night from the drug trade.  Two members of the NYP- Robert Duval and Mark Wahlberg as father and son want to bring that drug trade down. The other brother, Joaquin Phoenix, for whatever reason, has become the manager of a club that caters to the drug crowd. At opposite ends, oh yes. Until, until, something big happens and the son Bobby Green turns to the side of the law. Eva Menedes does an admirable job playing Bobby's love interest, and this emotional tangle brings this film some real credibility.The action in this film and in particular the car chase on a wet rainy night with fog so thick you can barely see is a raw knuckle event. The raw and grainy fear is palpable, and I can envision the fear and heart racing excitement.""But this is an atmospheric, intense film, well acted, and when it's working it has a real urgency. Scenes where a protagonist is close to being unmasked almost always work. The complexity of Bobby's motives grows intriguing, and the concern of his girl friend Armada is well-used. ""We Own the Night"" may not solve the question of ownership, but it does explore who lives in the night, and why.""

Zwick,"[12, 13]","***1/2Taking its title from the motto engraved on all NYPD officers' badges, ""We Own the Night"" is essentially the Prodigal Son story transplanted to the mean, crime-ridden streets of New York City.  Robert Duvall is Burt Grusinsky, a high ranking police chief with two sons, one ""good"" and the other ""bad.""  Joseph has eagerly followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a captain on the force, while Bobby wants nothing whatsoever to do with the police and, in fact, spends much of his time running around with the unsavory drug dealers who frequent the lucrative nightclub he successfully manages.  It isn't until one of those associates has Joseph shot after a narcotics raid on the club that Bobby learns where his true loyalties lie.  He agrees to go undercover for the force to unmask the identity of the shooter and bring down the Russian drug cartel that set Joseph up.At times, while watching the movie, I kept thinking that writer/director James Gray had simply grafted the Michael Corleone story onto ""The Departed.""  Still, despite its derivative nature, ""We Own the Night"" is a tightly scripted, occasionally ingenious police procedural featuring a riveting, knockout performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the role of Bobby.  He gets solid support from Duval, Mark Wahlberg as Joseph, and Eva Mendes as the true love who doesn't feel all that comfortable with Bobby's sudden fascination with helping out the police.Gray provides a number of highly suspenseful moments, as well as a terrifically mounted car chase through the rain-soaked streets of the city.  The sound is also unusually effective, creating an often surrealistic sense of dislocation at crucial dramatic moments (though the Blondie-inspired soundtrack is slightly anachronistic for 1988, the year in which the story is set).Bobby's conversion from lawbreaker to law enforcer is not always entirely convincing and we are often forced to accept quite a bit on faith just to keep the story rolling.  In the long run, though, the polish and professionalism displayed on both sides of the camera ultimately lift the movie above its various imperfections.",3,interesting plot and fine Joaquin Phoenix performance,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,2128,"['***1/2Taking', 'title', 'motto', 'engraved', 'NYPD', 'officers', 'badges', 'Own', 'Night', 'essentially', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'story', 'transplanted', 'mean', 'crime-ridden', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Burt', 'Grusinsky', 'high', 'ranking', 'police', 'chief', 'two', 'sons', 'one', 'good', 'other', 'bad', 'Joseph', 'eagerly', 'followed', 'father', 'footsteps', 'becoming', 'captain', 'force', 'Bobby', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'police', 'fact', 'much', 'time', 'running', 'around', 'unsavory', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', 'frequent', 'lucrative', 'nightclub', 'successfully', ""n't"", 'one', 'associates', 'Joseph', 'shot', 'narcotics', 'raid', 'club', 'Bobby', 'where', 'true', 'loyalties', 'lie', 'go', 'undercover', 'force', 'unmask', 'identity', 'shooter', 'bring', 'down', 'Russian', 'drug', 'cartel', 'set', 'Joseph', 'up.At', 'times', 'watching', 'movie', 'kept', 'thinking', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Gray', 'had', 'simply', 'grafted', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'story', 'Departed', 'Still', 'derivative', 'nature', 'Own', 'Night', 'tightly', 'scripted', 'occasionally', 'ingenious', 'police', 'procedural', 'featuring', 'riveting', 'knockout', 'performance', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'role', 'Bobby', 'solid', 'support', 'Duval', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Joseph', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'true', 'love', 'who', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comfortable', 'Bobby', 'sudden', 'fascination', 'helping', 'out', 'police.Gray', 'number', 'highly', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'terrifically', 'mounted', 'car', 'chase', 'rain-soaked', 'streets', 'city', 'sound', 'also', 'unusually', 'effective', 'creating', 'often', 'surrealistic', 'sense', 'dislocation', 'crucial', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Blondie-inspired', 'soundtrack', 'slightly', 'anachronistic', '1988', 'year', 'story', 'set', '.Bobby', 'conversion', 'lawbreaker', 'law', 'enforcer', 'not', 'always', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'are', 'often', 'forced', 'accept', 'quite', 'bit', 'faith', 'just', 'keep', 'story', 'rolling', 'long', 'run', 'though', 'polish', 'professionalism', 'displayed', 'sides', 'camera', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'various', 'imperfections']",We Own the Night

There is an awful lot about We Own the Night that commands respect; from an innovatively handled car-chase about two-thirds of the way through, to a solid central performance from Phoenix - not to mention the gritty and realistic late '80s setting. However, it all feels disappointingly conventional. We spend the vast majority of the time with Bobby and sympathise with his conflict deeply, but we're never given the same expansion of character for his brother or father. This severely affects Wahlberg's performance, as the hugely-competent actor is given nothing to do, other than look intense and thoughtful. There needed to be a balance there, as the film is predominantly about family - but writerdirector Gray chooses to give us more time with Bobby and his girlfriend Amada (Mendes). This is fine for the most part (thanks to an excellent Mendes), but diverts from the core story, which is about the decision Bobby must make and its subsequent consequences. Gray has a very nice visual style and obviously knows the city he's shooting in like the back of his hand, and this results in a much more genuine-feeling crime film that the recently-released American Gangster. But if he'd only had a couple more passes at his final draft, or allowed a co-writer to come in and realign the stringently-off narrative, then we could have a contender on our hands, as he's obviously a director with ability. Script-wise however, he goes for the grand themes of loyalty, instead of using progressive narrative to compliment the hard edged setting, and that causes a sporadically absorbing film to lack resonance. As a cinematic showreel for the abilities of Joaquin Phoenix, We Own the Night is an unequivocal success; but for a character-driven crime drama, it lacks a dimension.",3,nous poss&eacute;dons la nuit,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,2139,"['Bobby', 'Green', 'Phoenix', 'ambitious', 'New', 'York', 'club', 'manager', 'who', 'dragged', 'crime', 'underworld', 'when', 'nephew', 'club', 'Russian', 'owner', 'using', 'place', 'base', 'drug', 'operations', 'attracting', 'attention', 'Bobby', 'Police', 'Chief', 'father', 'Duvall', 'dedicated', 'cop', 'brother', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'want', 'decide', 'side', 'law', 'awful', 'lot', 'Own', 'Night', 'respect', 'innovatively', 'handled', 'car-chase', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'solid', 'central', 'performance', 'Phoenix', 'not', 'mention', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'late', ""'80s"", 'setting', 'However', 'feels', 'disappointingly', 'conventional', 'spend', 'vast', 'majority', 'time', 'Bobby', 'sympathise', 'conflict', 'deeply', ""'re"", 'never', 'given', 'same', 'expansion', 'character', 'brother', 'father', 'severely', 'Wahlberg', 'performance', 'hugely-competent', 'actor', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'look', 'intense', 'thoughtful', 'needed', 'be', 'balance', 'there', 'film', 'predominantly', 'family', 'writerdirector', 'Gray', 'give', 'more', 'time', 'Bobby', 'girlfriend', 'Amada', 'Mendes', 'fine', 'most', 'part', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'Mendes', 'diverts', 'core', 'story', 'decision', 'Bobby', 'must', 'make', 'subsequent', 'consequences', 'Gray', 'very', 'nice', 'visual', 'style', 'obviously', 'city', 'shooting', 'back', 'hand', 'results', 'much', 'more', 'genuine-feeling', 'crime', 'film', 'recently-released', 'American', 'Gangster', ""'d"", 'only', 'had', 'couple', 'more', 'passes', 'final', 'draft', 'allowed', 'co-writer', 'come', 'realign', 'stringently-off', 'narrative', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'contender', 'hands', 'obviously', 'director', 'ability', 'Script-wise', 'however', 'grand', 'themes', 'loyalty', 'instead', 'using', 'progressive', 'narrative', 'compliment', 'hard', 'edged', 'setting', 'sporadically', 'absorbing', 'film', 'lack', 'resonance', 'cinematic', 'showreel', 'abilities', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Own', 'Night', 'unequivocal', 'success', 'character-driven', 'crime', 'drama', 'dimension']",We Own the Night
1123610,A10RYB48HQ46Z6,B000ZS8GWQ,The Helmsman,"[3, 4]","We Own The Night starts off with an interesting premise. In one corner, you have Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix) living the high life, with a beautiful woman on his arm (Eva Mendes), running a successful Brooklyn nightclub with drug-dealing Russian mafiosos. In the other corner, you have his estranged father and brother (Robert Duvall and Mark Wahlberg), who wear the blue uniform of the NYPD and make their living putting Bobby's friends behind bars. Family drama meets cop drama.Of course, something bad happens, and Bobby is forced to pick sides. In the moment of truth, does he choose his blood, and the law, or does he stick with the life he has chosen and his new 'family?'Unfortunately this decision is made halfway through the movie, far earlier than it should have been. The buildup happens too quickly, and then he makes his decision, which also happens too quickly. You don't know WHY he chooses the way he does. And then almost everything that happens after that is ultimately unnecessary. It's a shame, because I was totally engrossed up until that moment when the fateful decision is made. Then the movie just fell apart. The second half of the movie is predictable, yet still manages to be unbelievable. Worse, it feels contrived.There are good moments. The brothers at each other's throats was one. The car chase in the pouring rain was another. But those moments are few and far between, and the story holding them together is.... well, it is. As in, it exists. But it's neither believable nor good. The decision, the whole point of the movie, happens far too soon, and everything that follows is ridiculous. The ending is abrupt (which is rather ironic, considering that it should have come about a half hour earlier), forced, and completely unbelievable.Speaking of the ending, it also leaves a ton of loose ends not tied. To name just one, what the heck happens to Eva Mendes? She's a good counterpart to Joaquin, the chemistry between them is great, she's with him through some of his most trying moments, and you get to care about her. Then she disappears and you never see her again for the rest of the movie (except for a blink-and-you-miss-it moment at the end, but wait, it wasn't real anyway). You're given a reason, but it's nowhere near good enough. I don't buy it. That's just bad storytelling. The actors turn in fine performances, but they are wasted on the material, here.Overall, this isn't a terrible movie. It just could have been so much better. If you want a good cop drama, go with The Departed, or even better, The French Connection.

1123614,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B000ZS8GWQ,Tristan,"[12, 14]","One of the saddest things in film is watching the utter waste of impressive and potential talent. We Own the Night is one such film.The film stars Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg, Robert Duvall, and Eva Mendes and has the outline for a good story--two brothers on opposite sides of the law--despite it being somewhat unoriginal. Even with this much promise and generous runtime of two hours, this film manages to ruin all the possible good performances by under-developing the characters as well as cramming way too much into the plot.Because of that very reason I will not go into the details of the plot. All that is really explainable is that as I said there are two brothers one a police officer (played by Mark Wahlberg) the other a night club manager (played by Joaquin Phoenix). Their father (played by Robert Duvall) is the police chief and he wants Joaquin to help him catch a major drug dealer. This sounds simple enough but there are more subplots that break of from there that don't leave enough time for each one so you never connect with any of the characters or their plights. Everything is so quick, easy, and comes together so simply that it reminds me almost of one of those B-grade TV movies that went straight to DVD.It is so sad seeing the talent of two Oscar-nominated actors wasted. There is nothing wrong with both Wahlberg's and Joaquin's performances, but their characters are so by-the-book with no warmth or energy to them that it causes their performances to seem mediocre.There is nothing striking about the film production everything is what we would see in many other gangster/drug lord films. There also seemed to be to many similar moments from others films including slow-motion shots.By the end of the film I felt completely shut out from it, just hoping it would end soon. The only thing that made it even slightly bearable to tolerate for its' two hours was the fact that it had such a good cast who all tried their best with the material. It was as if they were on a sinking ship and even with desperate attempts to pump the water out and plug the hole the ship was still going to sink.",1,We own the talent,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,2124,"['One', 'saddest', 'things', 'film', 'watching', 'utter', 'waste', 'impressive', 'potential', 'talent', 'Own', 'Night', 'one', 'such', 'film.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'outline', 'good', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'opposite', 'sides', 'law', 'being', 'somewhat', 'unoriginal', 'Even', 'much', 'promise', 'generous', 'runtime', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'ruin', 'possible', 'good', 'performances', 'under-developing', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'cramming', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'plot.Because', 'very', 'reason', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'details', 'plot', 'really', 'explainable', 'said', 'are', 'two', 'brothers', 'one', 'police', 'officer', 'played', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'other', 'night', 'club', 'manager', 'played', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'father', 'played', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'police', 'chief', 'Joaquin', 'help', 'catch', 'major', 'drug', 'dealer', 'simple', 'enough', 'are', 'more', 'subplots', 'break', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'enough', 'time', 'one', 'so', 'never', 'connect', 'characters', 'plights', 'Everything', 'so', 'quick', 'easy', 'together', 'so', 'simply', 'almost', 'one', 'B-grade', 'TV', 'movies', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD.It', 'so', 'sad', 'seeing', 'talent', 'two', 'Oscar-nominated', 'actors', 'wasted', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Wahlberg', 'Joaquin', 'performances', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'by-the-book', 'warmth', 'energy', 'performances', 'seem', 'nothing', 'striking', 'film', 'production', 'everything', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'many', 'other', 'gangster/drug', 'lord', 'films', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'many', 'similar', 'moments', 'others', 'films', 'including', 'slow-motion', 'shots.By', 'end', 'film', 'felt', 'completely', 'shut', 'out', 'just', 'hoping', 'would', 'end', 'soon', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'even', 'slightly', 'bearable', 'tolerate', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'fact', 'had', 'such', 'good', 'cast', 'who', 'tried', 'best', 'material', 'was', 'were', 'sinking', 'ship', 'even', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'pump', 'water', 'plug', 'hole', 'ship', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'sink']",We Own the Night
1123615,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ZS8GWQ,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""We Own the Night"" is writer/director James Gray's third film after ""Little Odessa"" and ""The Yard."" Anyone who has seen his previous films would not be surprised to find that his latest effort about ""Two brothers on opposite sides of the law"" is slow-moving and somber. Though there is one gripping car chase scene and one shoot-out, ""We Own the Night"" is not about actions; it is about the characters played by Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg, or more simply put, families.The film is set in the late 1980s. Joaquin Phoenix is Bobby Green, manager of a Russian nightclub frequented by a gangster Nezhinski. Bobby has an older brother Joseph Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg), newly promoted NYPD captain, who is after Nezhinski and other drug cartel members. While Deputy Chief Bert Grusinsky (Robert Duvall), father of Bobby and Joseph, is proud of Joseph, he is very disappointed with Bobby, to whomJames Gray's filmmaking technique reminds us of the 70s-style crime drama that has realistic, atmospheric images. The idea of brothers from the same family opposing each other is particularly new, but the film is bolstered by the strong acting from the cast (including Eva Mendes as Amada, Bobby's kind girlfriend) and the stylish (but not showy) visuals that keep us interested in the unpredictable story. James Gray is quite good at setting up the mood and building up the tension, and one car action scene in heavy rain is outstanding (actually the rain is added by special effects).I know this is not the first film that tackles the theme of loyalty. Also, brotherly love has been used as the film's theme many times before elsewhere (including Gray's own ""Little Odessa""). However, ""We Own the Night,"" familiar and gloomy as it is, is a very good film with intense acting and atmosphere.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Intense, Atmospheric Crime Drama",1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,1788,"['Own', 'Night', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Gray', 'third', 'film', 'Little', 'Odessa', 'Yard', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'previous', 'films', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'latest', 'effort', 'Two', 'brothers', 'opposite', 'sides', 'law', 'slow-moving', 'somber', 'one', 'gripping', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'one', 'shoot-out', 'Own', 'Night', 'not', 'actions', 'characters', 'played', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'more', 'simply', 'put', 'families.The', 'film', 'set', 'late', '1980s', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Bobby', 'Green', 'manager', 'Russian', 'nightclub', 'frequented', 'gangster', 'Nezhinski', 'Bobby', 'older', 'brother', 'Joseph', 'Grusinsky', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'newly', 'promoted', 'NYPD', 'captain', 'who', 'Nezhinski', 'other', 'drug', 'cartel', 'members', 'Deputy', 'Chief', 'Bert', 'Grusinsky', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'father', 'Bobby', 'Joseph', 'proud', 'Joseph', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Bobby', 'whomJames', 'Gray', 'filmmaking', 'technique', '70s-style', 'crime', 'drama', 'realistic', 'atmospheric', 'images', 'idea', 'brothers', 'same', 'family', 'opposing', 'other', 'particularly', 'new', 'film', 'bolstered', 'strong', 'acting', 'cast', 'including', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Amada', 'Bobby', 'kind', 'girlfriend', 'stylish', 'not', 'showy', 'visuals', 'keep', 'interested', 'unpredictable', 'story', 'James', 'Gray', 'quite', 'good', 'setting', 'up', 'mood', 'building', 'up', 'tension', 'one', 'car', 'action', 'scene', 'heavy', 'rain', 'outstanding', 'actually', 'rain', 'added', 'special', 'effects', '.I', 'know', 'not', 'first', 'film', 'theme', 'loyalty', 'Also', 'brotherly', 'love', 'been', 'used', 'film', 'theme', 'many', 'times', 'elsewhere', 'including', 'Gray', 'own', 'Little', 'Odessa', 'However', 'Own', 'Night', 'familiar', 'gloomy', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'intense', 'acting', 'atmosphere']",We Own the Night

Outstanding performances from Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg and Robert Duvall make this a worthwhile venture. Set in the early 80's (great soundtrack, by the way), the film explores the conversion of a bad guy (Phoenix), born into a family of cops, into a hero. Eva Mendes turns in an arresting performance as Phoenix's girlfriend: touching, intense and sexy. The action in this film is stunning. There's a car chase that will make you jump out of your seat.

This time, they play brothers on opposite side of the law in 1988 New York City.  Wahlberg is a straight-arrow police captain who follows in the footsteps of their successful father, Robert Duvall who is a Deputy Chief, whereas Phoenix runs a hot nightclub for some Russians who deal in the drug business. Wahlberg tries to bring down the Russians and solicits the help of Phoenix, who turns him down, preferring the money and drugs that come along with his current position.  These two worlds, though, will soon collide.""We Own the Night"" is a solid cop/gangster movie with a nice vintage feel; although set in the 80s, it reminded me of gritty 70s cop films.  The story is small-scale, which allows for character development.  There's nothing novel about the plot, but there are some terrific scenes, especially an exciting rain-drenched car chase.  Unfortunately, the movie loses credibility in the last half hour with some unbelievable plot twists and a few melodramatic scenes.
