Here it is 2011, and I haven't seen this movie since the late '80's when it came out as a rental VHS, but I remember it well. The con man representing a ""detective school"", is able to deceive a naive out-of-work New Yorker into becoming a licensed private eye - just like in all the pulp detective novels he can't tear his eyes away from (hence getting fired from all of his jobs). Along the way, we get to meet a cast of absolutely hilarious characters, namely the obese, mean-spirited secretary of the school, the bossy old woman tourist that the teacher and his student keep bumping into (and annoying), the beautiful damsel in distress, and the Italian mafia! The car chase throughout Rome, the tower of Pisa, and the Vatican is worth the price of this film alone. The chemistry between the stars of this movie is great.

After its releash many of the funny scenes were used and reused in more popular movies until the funny is barely &#34;smileable. Detective School Dropouts didn't receive its props because, although the maker and stars of the movie, brothers were famous, they were not, plus it was a low budget film with little publicity given. I saw it by accident and it had me laughing even after it was over. If I were writing this review when I first saw it and none of the funny scenes had been seen before, I would have given it a four stars, but if were seeing it for the first time today would give it three stars. So split the difference and four stars is the stars of the day for this one.",4,liked it,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,773,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'hysterical', 'funny', 'scenes', 'were', 'fresh', 'releash', 'many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'were', 'used', 'reused', 'more', 'popular', 'movies', 'funny', 'barely', '34', 'smileable', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'props', 'because', 'maker', 'stars', 'movie', 'brothers', 'were', 'famous', 'were', 'not', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'little', 'publicity', 'given', 'saw', 'accident', 'had', 'laughing', 'even', 'was', 'over', 'were', 'writing', 'review', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'none', 'funny', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'seen', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'stars', 'were', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'today', 'would', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'So', 'split', 'difference', 'four', 'stars', 'stars', 'day', 'one']",Detective School Dropouts
967257,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000E3FW7Y,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 1986, actors Lorin Dreyfuss (""Skatetown U.S.A., ""Clerks"" (TV), ""Superman"" (TV), ""Fantasy Island"") and David Lansberg (""The Jerk"", ""Stanley"", ""The Love Boat"") joined forces to create the comedy film ""Detective School Dropouts"".  The two wrote the film and worked with director Filippo Ottoni (""Twitch of the Death Nerve"", ""Jona che visse nella balena"").Despite the film becoming a box office flop, this film along with their followup film ""Dutch Treat"" have achieved a following because of its idiotic craziness.Now, the film has been released via Manufactured on Demand (M.O.D.) as part of Metro Goldwyn Mayer's ""Limited Edition Collection"". Which is a program in which people request the DVD to be printed, than the DVD actually being printed and distributed to stores.  These films are targeting a niche crowd of fans who have been wanting these films to be released on DVD but the studio never did.  These MOD's, according to MGM, are made with the best source possible and most often, do not come with any special features.MOD PLAYABILITY:Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality of the discs. There are some who can't get them to play on various DVD players or on their computers and unfortunately, they literally become table-top coasters.With ""Detective School Dropouts"", I can tell you that these discs are printed quite well with actual printing on top of the DVD (it's not a plain silver disc with letters). If you didn't know the disc was an MOD DVD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.As for playability, I played it on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems. I then played it on my Mac, no problems whatsoever.VIDEO AND AUDIO:As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available. But its important to remember that ""Detective School Dropouts"" is a 1986 low-budget film, the film does look its age, but definitely an upgrade over the rare VHS. As for audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital. Dialogue is clear as well as the '80s synth music.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Detective School Dropouts"" does not come with any special features.JUDGMENT CALL:""Detective School Dropouts"" is one of those crazy '80s slapstick comedies that were popular at the time.  A film that I grew up with and have not seen for over 20-years.And while the film did not receive the best reviews, nor did it to do well in the box office, it has become a cult-hit because it's one of those crazy comedies that you just don't see today.  Many comedy films today try to be funny and feature inept characters but with ""Detective School Dropouts"", it's not trying to be funny or dumb, it just is.David Landsberg and Lorin Dreyfuss are a hilarious duo and although they only have made two films, ""Detective School Dropouts"" is one of those low-budget films where you wonder how they pulled certain things off in Italy.  At times, it seems their was no permit to shoot a film because onlookers were obviously not aware that a film was being shot.  And it kind of adds to the hilariousness of this film.Favorite scenes include Donald and Paul stealing an Italian sports car and find themselves racing through the Italian countryside in fear as they are in shock of how fast the car is going.Another scene shows the two dressed up as monks and start beating up each other in front of the nuns and priests, while curious Italian onlookers not sure what to make of it.I also enjoyed the running gag of this older couple, the wife is constantly trying to be photographed by her husband in Italy, but each time, both Donald and Paul get in her way.While I wish ""Detective School Dropouts"" have received a normal DVD release with special feature showcasing a reunion with both men and perhaps even an audio commentary, but I suppose that because the VHS has been out-of-print for so long, this made on demand DVD will do.While I know this film may not be for everyone and it may be too idiotic for some, I'm all for moronic humor, especially comedies that are surprisingly silly.  ""Detective School Dropouts"" is an '80s comedy that is just hilarious, outrageous, moronic and fun!For those who grew up watching this film or are quite nostalgic of this outrageous and crazy film, then this DVD is for you!",3,"""Detective School Dropouts"" is an '80s comedy that is just hilarious, outrageous, moronic and fun!",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,4280,"['1986', 'actors', 'Lorin', 'Dreyfuss', 'Skatetown', 'U.S.A.', 'Clerks', 'TV', 'Superman', 'TV', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'David', 'Lansberg', 'Jerk', 'Stanley', 'Love', 'Boat', 'joined', 'forces', 'create', 'comedy', 'film', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', 'two', 'wrote', 'film', 'worked', 'director', 'Filippo', 'Ottoni', 'Twitch', 'Death', 'Nerve', 'Jona', 'che', 'visse', 'nella', 'balena', '.Despite', 'film', 'becoming', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'film', 'followup', 'film', 'Dutch', 'Treat', 'have', 'achieved', 'following', 'idiotic', 'craziness.Now', 'film', 'been', 'released', 'Manufactured', 'Demand', 'M.O.D', 'part', 'Metro', 'Goldwyn', 'Mayer', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'Collection', 'Which', 'program', 'people', 'request', 'DVD', 'be', 'printed', 'DVD', 'actually', 'being', 'printed', 'distributed', 'stores', 'films', 'are', 'targeting', 'niche', 'crowd', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'films', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'studio', 'never', 'did', 'MOD', 'according', 'MGM', 'are', 'made', 'best', 'source', 'possible', 'most', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'special', 'features.MOD', 'PLAYABILITY', 'Part', 'worry', 'viewers', 'who', 'had', 'bad', 'experiences', 'MOD', 'DVD', 'are', 'printing', 'quality', 'discs', 'are', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'play', 'various', 'DVD', 'players', 'computers', 'unfortunately', 'literally', 'become', 'table-top', 'coasters.With', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', 'can', 'tell', 'discs', 'are', 'printed', 'quite', 'well', 'actual', 'printing', 'top', 'DVD', 'not', 'plain', 'silver', 'disc', 'letters', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'disc', 'was', 'MOD', 'DVD', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'actual', 'DVD', 'release.As', 'playability', 'played', 'Sony', 'PlayStation', '3', 'problems', 'then', 'played', 'Mac', 'problems', 'whatsoever.VIDEO', 'AUDIO', 'As', 'far', 'picture', 'quality', 'film', 'been', 'manufactured', 'using', 'best', 'source', 'available', 'important', 'remember', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', '1986', 'low-budget', 'film', 'film', 'look', 'age', 'definitely', 'upgrade', 'rare', 'VHS', 'audio', 'film', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Dialogue', 'clear', 'as', 'well', ""'80s"", 'synth', 'music.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', 'not', 'come', 'special', 'features.JUDGMENT', 'CALL', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', 'one', 'crazy', ""'80s"", 'slapstick', 'comedies', 'were', 'popular', 'time', 'film', 'grew', 'up', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '20-years.And', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'best', 'reviews', 'did', 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'become', 'cult-hit', 'one', 'crazy', 'comedies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'today', 'Many', 'comedy', 'films', 'today', 'try', 'be', 'funny', 'feature', 'inept', 'characters', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'dumb', 'just', 'is.David', 'Landsberg', 'Lorin', 'Dreyfuss', 'are', 'hilarious', 'duo', 'only', 'have', 'made', 'two', 'films', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', 'one', 'low-budget', 'films', 'where', 'wonder', 'how', 'pulled', 'certain', 'things', 'off', 'Italy', 'times', 'was', 'permit', 'shoot', 'film', 'onlookers', 'were', 'obviously', 'not', 'aware', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'shot', 'kind', 'hilariousness', 'film.Favorite', 'scenes', 'include', 'Donald', 'Paul', 'stealing', 'Italian', 'sports', 'car', 'find', 'racing', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'fear', 'are', 'shock', 'how', 'fast', 'car', 'going.Another', 'scene', 'two', 'dressed', 'up', 'monks', 'start', 'beating', 'up', 'other', 'front', 'nuns', 'priests', 'curious', 'Italian', 'onlookers', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'it.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'running', 'gag', 'older', 'couple', 'wife', 'constantly', 'trying', 'be', 'photographed', 'husband', 'Italy', 'time', 'Donald', 'Paul', 'get', 'way.While', 'wish', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', 'have', 'received', 'normal', 'DVD', 'release', 'special', 'feature', 'showcasing', 'reunion', 'men', 'perhaps', 'even', 'audio', 'commentary', 'suppose', 'VHS', 'been', 'out-of-print', 'so', 'long', 'made', 'demand', 'DVD', 'will', 'do.While', 'know', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'idiotic', ""'m"", 'moronic', 'humor', 'especially', 'comedies', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'silly', 'Detective', 'School', 'Dropouts', ""'80s"", 'comedy', 'just', 'hilarious', 'outrageous', 'moronic', 'fun', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'nostalgic', 'outrageous', 'crazy', 'film', 'then', 'DVD']",Detective School Dropouts

Detective School Dropouts stars David Landsberg and Lorn Dreyfuss, two little known and under appreciated actors.  Most of the action occurs in Italy, with delightful scenes in Rome, Pisa, and Venice.Basically, the plot involves a luckless man who keeps losing jobs because he  daydreams about being a detective.  He enrolls in a detective school administered by a private eye who is usually broke and unable to pay his bills.  Together they decide to  form a detective partnership and take a complicated case that involves three Italian crime families.Detective School Dropouts is in the tradition of the Three Stooges and Abbot and Costello, two very funny comedy teams.  The plot is full of sight gags and ""slapstick"" humor.  One of the minor character reminds me of the English comedian (Eric Idle) who has ""accidents"" by continually running into Chevy Chase in National Lampoons  European Vacation.
