If you are a fan of Rock Hudson, then you will be delighted to see his humorous act in this movie. Nothing can be added to make this movie better than what it is now.Come September is one of those very light, romantic, and comedy movies ever made. You can see this movie whenever you want a break from all the movies we get to see these days.

394967,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6304005482,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[61, 61]","This nice old-fashioned plot about boy meets girl, girl gets boy is a fabulous showcase for Gina Lollobrigida's enormous talent and beauty, and with the help of the comedic skills of Walter Slezak, make this film (at least the last hour of it), laugh-out-loud hilarious. This was Lollobrigida's biggest hit in America, and deservedly so; Rock Hudson makes a great partner for her, much as he was doing in this early 60's era with Doris Day in many films.Hudson plays American tycoon Robert Talbot, who finds that while he is away, his villa has been turned into a hotel, and his girl is about to marry someone else.The secondary plot brings together young tourists Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin, who sings (and wrote) ""Multiplication"" in a nightclub sequence. Cupid played his part with these two actors, as they were married soon after the film was completed.Walter Slezak is marvelous as Maurice, Talbot's major domo, who manipulates every situation around him, and there is some clever dialogue in the film, much of it said by him. Robert Mulligan's direction is fast paced, and cinematographer William Daniels makes the most of the location shots of Rome, Milan and Portofino.There is such innocence in this film, and it's so deliciously un-politically correct. This is not one for die-hard feminists, but will be enjoyed by anyone who likes the fluffy and genuinely funny comedies of that era...and to see the sheer beauty of Lollobrigida, and the perfect timing of her delivery...I love the way she says ""I don't have to make sense, I'm Italian !""Total playing time is 114 minutes.",5,the birds and the bees,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1584,"['nice', 'old-fashioned', 'plot', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'girl', 'boy', 'fabulous', 'showcase', 'Gina', 'Lollobrigida', 'enormous', 'talent', 'beauty', 'help', 'comedic', 'skills', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'make', 'film', 'least', 'last', 'hour', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'was', 'Lollobrigida', 'biggest', 'hit', 'America', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'great', 'partner', 'much', 'was', 'doing', 'early', '60', 'era', 'Doris', 'Day', 'many', 'films.Hudson', 'plays', 'American', 'tycoon', 'Robert', 'Talbot', 'who', 'away', 'villa', 'been', 'turned', 'hotel', 'girl', 'marry', 'someone', 'else.The', 'secondary', 'plot', 'together', 'young', 'tourists', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'who', 'wrote', 'Multiplication', 'nightclub', 'sequence', 'Cupid', 'played', 'part', 'two', 'actors', 'were', 'married', 'soon', 'film', 'was', 'completed.Walter', 'Slezak', 'marvelous', 'Maurice', 'Talbot', 'major', 'domo', 'who', 'situation', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'film', 'much', 'said', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'direction', 'fast', 'paced', 'cinematographer', 'William', 'Daniels', 'most', 'location', 'shots', 'Rome', 'Milan', 'Portofino.There', 'such', 'innocence', 'film', 'so', 'deliciously', 'un-politically', 'correct', 'not', 'one', 'die-hard', 'feminists', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'who', 'fluffy', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'comedies', 'era', 'see', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'Lollobrigida', 'perfect', 'timing', 'delivery', 'love', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'sense', ""'m"", 'Italian', 'Total', 'playing', 'time', '114', 'minutes']",N/A

It is occupied by a tour group of American girls, a chaperone, which is sweet on Maurice, and Cedric (who is drunk).  I think Cedric was a nice touch.  Due to circumstances out of Roberts's control, he ends up chaperoning the girls.Parallel to this a group of American Boys are heading for a hotel (Being the villa) that actually does not exist.  They confront Rock Hudson on the road and antagonize him repeatedly referring to his car.  ""Gee mister she's a beaut"".  Later with nowhere to stay, the boys camp out in front of the villa full of girls.  To get Rock Hudson out of they are way thy try out drinking him and out running him.Just as you, thing Rock Hudson has the upper hand he pulls a faux pas.  In an attempt to ward off Tony (Bobby Darin) he tells Sandra Dee that no man would buy something if he could get free samples.

For six years, he's been spending his vacation there in September with his Italian girlfriend, Lisa Fellini - a stunningly beautiful and sensual Gina Lollobrigida. One year, he changed his plans and arrived in July. To Talbot's utter surprise he found out that his devoted major-domo, Maurice (Walter Slezak stole all his scenes as an employee who has his very own ideas of loyalty and devotion) , has been making nice money by turning his villa into a popular and posh hotel ""La Dolce Vista"" once his employer leaves for America.  Lisa is tired of being a "" September girl"" and decides to marry another man.  On the top of all, Talbot finds himself chaperoning a group of six American teenage girls vacationing in Italy, and fighting a generational  war with the group of four  American college boys  whose hotel reservation he cancelled and who settled in a tent just outside the villa and began courting the girls.  Talbot's biggest concern is Tony (Bobby Darin),  the leader of the gang, a medical student who wants to seduce young  and innocent blonde Sandy (Sandy Dee),  the psychology major. The film is a nice way to spend two hours.  Darin sings the song"" Multiplication"" that he had composed for the movie and I wonder if the song was one of the reasons Dee and pop idol Bobby Darin fell in love  with each other in real life  and were married just after the filming was over. Hudson and Lollobrigida have a nice chemistry and there is also their dance together.  While watching her dance, you would wholeheartedly agree with Tony that never 206 bones that a human body includes were constructed so perfectly.

I hadn't seen it since it aired on television a few years ago, and I'd forgotten how humorous and entertaining it was.Robert Talbot (Rock Hudson, proving his comedic talent)has a beautiful Italian villa he only uses during the month of September, which also fits his beautiful local girlfriend, Lisa (Gina Lollobrigida)for that same month a year. Lisa is so frustrated that she is preparing to marry an English gentlemen (Sidney Howard), but she reconsiders when Robert decides to fly in in July. What the business man does not know is that his butler, Maurice (Walter Slezak, who nearly steals the show), has been using the villa as a hotel. Talbot finds his place swarming with tourists, including a group of college girls. And then the college boys make a landing, headed by Tony (Bobby Darin) who immediately sets his sights on Sandy (Sandra Dee), while Talbot cunningly tries to keep these young fellows away from the girls, which leads to more funny and romantic complications.This movie is fantastic all around. From the breathtakingly gorgeous Italian scenery, to the costumes, wonderful chemistry between the actors, and the music (with Darin crooning one of his own tunes, ""Multplication"" in a dance sequence), ""Come September"" is priceless. The electricity between Darin and Dee is so apparent, and this is a fitting tribute to both of them, and the fact that they married after filming wrapped makes the viewing of the film all the more enjoyable. Some hilarious lines too! ""Those boys are quite capable of dividing and multiplying!"" ""Do it to others before they do it to you!"" ""There's a body missing! A body I don't want to have missing!""

His girlfriend Lisa Fellini (Gina Lollobrigida) has given up waiting for him and has decided to marry an Englishman named Spencer (Ronald Howard). Meanwhile other surprises are in the works, like his villa is converted into a hotel by his staff lead by his butler, Maurice Clavell (Walter Slezak), and the hotel is full of guests; mainly a group of young American women, and a chaperone named Brenda de Banzie (Margaret Allison)) with an eye for Maurice. It is hilarious to watch as the staff tries to keep that secret from Talbot, but it won't be a secret long. In the mean time Lisa breaks off the engagement and stays at Talbot's Villa. Then comes the trouble; a group of American male students arrive at the hotel on a prior reservation, but Talbot cancels the reservation. Then students camp just outside the villa, and start dating the young women who are staying as guests of the hotel. Soon these students find an ""ally"" in Lisa who supports their camp. Talbot gets real worried and his fatherly instincts get better of him, and he forces himself to ""protect"" the girls while they are on date with the boys by chaperoning them. It is hilarious to watch as the boys try to outsmart him by losing him during a date or during a picnic but to no avail.There are some hilarious moments that include; when Lisa snubs the sisters of Spencer who come to meet her; and constant man - woman type of irritation and fights between Lisa and Talbot. The secondary plot brings together young tourists Sandy Stevens (Sandra Dee) and Tony (Bobby Darin), who sings (and wrote) ""Multiplication"" in a nightclub scene. Bobby Darin makes his feature debut in this movie and marry Sandra Dee ten days after the completion of the film. The movie shows some excellent shots in the Italian countryside that includes locations in Rome, Milan and Portofino, and the music is outstanding. The movie is well directed by Robert Mulligan who goes on to make his Academy award winning To Kill a Mockingbird in the following year (1962). This is the first of the two successful movies Hudson made with Lollobrigida, the success of this movie in 1961 lead to the production of Strange Bedfellows in 1965.1.To Kill a Mockingbird (Universal Legacy Series)2.Strange Bedfellows",5,Summer breeze keeps coming in September,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,2363,"['Robert', 'Talbot', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'beautiful', 'villa', 'July', 'instead', 'regular', 'trips', 'September', 'girlfriend', 'Lisa', 'Fellini', 'Gina', 'Lollobrigida', 'given', 'up', 'waiting', 'decided', 'marry', 'Englishman', 'named', 'Spencer', 'Ronald', 'Howard', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'surprises', 'are', 'works', 'villa', 'converted', 'hotel', 'staff', 'lead', 'butler', 'Maurice', 'Clavell', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'hotel', 'full', 'guests', 'mainly', 'group', 'young', 'American', 'women', 'chaperone', 'named', 'Brenda', 'de', 'Banzie', 'Margaret', 'Allison', 'eye', 'Maurice', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'staff', 'keep', 'secret', 'Talbot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'secret', 'long', 'mean', 'time', 'Lisa', 'engagement', 'stays', 'Talbot', 'Villa', 'Then', 'trouble', 'group', 'American', 'male', 'students', 'arrive', 'hotel', 'prior', 'reservation', 'Talbot', 'reservation', 'Then', 'students', 'camp', 'just', 'villa', 'start', 'dating', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'staying', 'guests', 'hotel', 'Soon', 'students', 'find', 'ally', 'Lisa', 'who', 'supports', 'camp', 'Talbot', 'real', 'worried', 'fatherly', 'instincts', 'get', 'better', 'protect', 'girls', 'are', 'date', 'boys', 'chaperoning', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'boys', 'try', 'outsmart', 'losing', 'date', 'picnic', 'avail.There', 'are', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'include', 'when', 'Lisa', 'snubs', 'sisters', 'Spencer', 'who', 'come', 'meet', 'constant', 'man', 'woman', 'type', 'irritation', 'fights', 'Lisa', 'Talbot', 'secondary', 'plot', 'together', 'young', 'tourists', 'Sandy', 'Stevens', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Tony', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'who', 'wrote', 'Multiplication', 'nightclub', 'scene', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'feature', 'debut', 'movie', 'marry', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'ten', 'days', 'completion', 'film', 'movie', 'excellent', 'shots', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'locations', 'Rome', 'Milan', 'Portofino', 'music', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'well', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'make', 'Academy', 'award', 'winning', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'following', 'year', '1962', 'first', 'two', 'successful', 'movies', 'Hudson', 'made', 'Lollobrigida', 'success', 'movie', '1961', 'lead', 'production', 'Strange', 'Bedfellows', '1965.1.To', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Universal', 'Legacy', 'Series', '2.Strange', 'Bedfellows']",N/A

It was 1960, in America we were dreaming of Camelot, and in sunny Italy a new prosperity was making life easier for most people.  Those were, indeed, happier days.  I look at this film with tremendous nostalgia.  Everything in it is just about perfect.  Rock reveals his gift for comedy in a very natural, spontaneous way.  Gina is absolutely stunning: a perfect beauty, an ideal woman.  The locations used for the film, at Santa Margherita Ligure and Portofino, are breathtaking.  A film I always go back to.
