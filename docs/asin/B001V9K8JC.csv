What this does is to raise up your imagination to think on a larger scale about the future.  What if so many of our leading scientists are right?  What if we are creating a global disaster in environmental terms?  This shows what the world will look like if all the human arrogance fails.  You must remember that this series is not very likely from a scientific point of view.  Sadly, humans will take a larger part of other living things with them if they really make a mess of things.  However, what this series does do is make you think about time.  The world, nature, is five billion years old.  People have been here for a mere 30,000 years.  The suicide of our species is a real possibility, although not in the exact manner shown in this series.

1243385,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B001V9K8JC,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[11, 13]","After enjoying the first show of Life after People as well as National Geographic's 'Aftermath: population Zero') I was naturally excited about this DVD. If you enjoyed the previous releases of LAP or APZ, then this DVD collection should be great for you. I already have the DVDs to APZ and the original LAP.Each episode in this series has a different theme, but sometimes the episodes deviate from these themes to concentrate on other things, which disappointed me because the original subject was then given scanty detail. For example, the episode 'Heavy Metal' told us what happened to the gold bars in the Reserve vault belowground... BUT what about the gold in Fort Knox, the gold on the surface remaining as jewelry and ingots, the gold used in paint and decorations, and what of silver, platinum, mercury, lead, etc? It would have been much better if each episode stuck entirely to what it was supposed to be about instead of wandering off into another subject and putting in more collapsing buildings (after a while, it does get old). Some episodes were more faithful to this concept than others.001 - The Bodies Left Behind - about man's pursuit of immortality and what happens to our attempts at it (frozen sperm and ova along with embryos and cryogenically frozen bodies) as well as some of mankind's treasures. Cons - not enough about the frozen tissue samples (what happens to the vaults and vats that guard these specimen? The failure of the containers is something I wanted to see along with the failure of electricity to keep things cold) and what happens to people who died within a week before LAP and are now laying in funeral homes? I was disappointed they didn't touch on that. How long would an embalmed body last vs an unembalmed one? Or bodies and medical waste in hospitals as well as cadavers?002 - Outbreak - A very disappointing one for me. Barely anything is said about all the animals left behind despite the title. The Queen of England's corgis were the spotlight. I have nothing against corgis, but as this episode was SUPPOSED to be about animals breaking out, why not show the struggles of household, zoo, and laboratory animals alike, instead of just the Queen's cute dogs?003 - Capital Threat - About what happens to our nation's treasures like the Constitution and the Memorials in DC.004 - Heavy Metal - See my complaints above. Aside gold, all metal mentioned here was for architecture like iron and steel.005 - Invaders - Overall a highly enjoyable episode about non-native species and the havoc they would wreak without humans to keep their populations under control, along with two cities struggling against the elements that slowly invade them.006 - Bound and Buried - Not a bad episode, but not one of the best ones either. Various treasures like the Declaration of Independence and the Mona Lisa.007 - Sin City Meltdown - What happens to Las Vegas and Atlantic City due to sand, wind, and water. Overall a fun episode, though I have one nitpick. In the original 90-min LAP, it was said that Las Vegas would be powered for about a year due to the hydroelectric power from the Hoover Dam, bur in this episode, Las Vegas loses power within a week.008 - Armed and Defenseless - Another very disappointing episode. It didn't even really focus on weapons that much. There was a whole bunch of stuff about dairy cows (Cows are discussed a couple of times in other episodes, making this unnecessary) and weapons really weren't discussed that much. We got two ships (both long decommissioned), some nuclear missiles, retired planes and not much else. Nothing was discussed of smaller-range weapons like handheld guns or rifles, regular bombs, or the buildings concerned with the safety of our country (Pentagon, for example). Other things that could have been discussed were tanks and planes still on active duty (with no white coat to protect them), aircraft carriers, machine guns, West Point Academy, the badges and decorations to be found on military uniforms and so on and so forth. Overall a useless episode, much like Outbreak.009 - Road to Nowhere - overall a good episode with a fitting title for its subject matter (cars and roads). Detroit (rather appropriately) is discussed here.010 - Waters of Death - Damaging effects of water, New Orleans and Seattle are discussed here as well as Dubai (but not much) This episode would have benefited from discussion of other water-cities like Venice and Amsterdam.As you can see, some episodes were better than others. I was terribly disappointed in Outbreak and Armed. Others, like 'Waters of Death' were more focused on the subject at hand and therefore more enjoyable. This episode was especially poignant for me because I have been to the Audubon Aquarium in New Orleans in 2001 and since I love water and aquariums, this place was heaven to me. This episode discussed what would happen to the aquarium after people - and the fact that it already happened (in 2005, after Katrina) Thinking about the deaths of all these critters I saw there due to Katrina was very painful.Having loved the original LAP as well as APZ, I found this documentary to be thrilling but repetitive in certain parts. In each episode, you have more and more collapsing buildings, which get old after a while, especially when most of them seem to collapse in just about the same way. This season would have been perfect if the theme of each episode was more closely adhered to, with more variety in subject and less collapsing buildings - we get the idea. Rust, water, wind, plants, vermin, etc will make the buildings collapse and so on and so forth. A wider range of research and more focus on smaller artifacts would have benefited this film greatly. I'd have liked to see what happened to smaller items like computers, cellphones, TVs, toys, clothing (hopefully these will be explored more in Season 2). Still, this is an entertaining series, and deserves a solid 4/5 stars.",4,Educational and entertaining,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,5944,"['enjoying', 'first', 'show', 'Life', 'People', 'as', 'well',

It isinteresting to know what lack of maintainence will do to a suspension bridge over a couple of hundred years, but there reallyisn`t any significant difference between what happens to such a bridge in San Francisco, New York, or Michigan. Same holds truewith most tall buildings, homes, ect.More than half of each episode is basicly a repete of the others in a different location.

1243388,A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5,B001V9K8JC,Olaf Johnson,"[4, 13]","While the idea is a good one, the execution is long tedious and boring. Alan Weisman's 2007 book The World Without Us pretty much kick started this whole speculative idea of the Green Apocalypse and is a much better source to get both the information and entertainment from.I really don't know why the producers stretched this out over so many hours of episodes when you can pretty much wrap up the entire idea in a 2 hour feature.Even the first episode feels drawn out. For example the point of episode one is to speculate on what happens to the human remains after we are gone. Sounds interesting right? Not after a few minutes when we realize the episode is NOT discussing the mounds of rotting human corpses left behind from some sort of mass genocide that would make the population zero but talks of mummies in museums and frozen bodies left in cryo as living humans magically vanish and there is no one left to keep the lights on. Even that somewhat interesting fact fails to warrant 43 minutes of TV time so what do they do. We spend some time talking about the Sistine Chapel, wooden ships in Boston, abandoned islands around Japan, Bridges, Guano, Parrots...I have no idea what any of that had to do with human remains left behind after the population is reduced to zero.Surely the speculation concerning the decaying corpses of 6 - 8 billion people laying in streets and houses across the planet will be much more interesting. Maybe new organsims that feed off the bacteria that decays human flesh will flourish and result in a new and complex food chain with human corpses being the base or progenitor.In fact what the first episode actually does is just cover a lot of other questions you would ask on the subject. because of this I'm not sure what the other 5 discs, 2 seasons and 19 episodes and 800+ minutes cover.I already spent a weekend out of my life with Alan Weisman's book so there is no way the pilot episode for this series convinced me to dedicate 800+ minutes more of my life to revisit what I already read.",2,Great idea...but I don't like the execution at all.,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,2033,"['idea', 'good', 'one', 'execution', 'long', 'tedious', 'boring', 'Alan', 'Weisman', '2007', 'book', 'World', 'Without', 'Us', 'pretty', 'much', 'kick', 'started', 'whole', 'speculative', 'idea', 'Green', 'Apocalypse', 'much', 'better', 'source', 'get', 'information', 'entertainment', 'from.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'producers', 'stretched', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'hours', 'episodes', 'when', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'wrap', 'up', 'entire', 'idea', '2', 'hour', 'feature.Even', 'first', 'episode', 'feels', 'drawn', 'out', 'example', 'point', 'episode', 'one', 'speculate', 'what', 'human', 'are', 'gone', 'interesting', 'right', 'Not', 'few', 'minutes', 'when', 'realize', 'episode', 'NOT', 'discussing', 'mounds', 'rotting', 'human', 'corpses', 'left', 'behind', 'sort', 'mass', 'genocide', 'would', 'make', 'population', 'zero', 'talks', 'mummies', 'museums', 'frozen', 'bodies', 'left', 'cryo', 'living', 'humans', 'magically', 'vanish', 'one', 'left', 'keep', 'lights', 'Even', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'fact', 'warrant', '43', 'minutes', 'TV', 'time', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'spend', 'time', 'talking', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'wooden', 'ships', 'Boston', 'abandoned', 'islands', 'Japan', 'Bridges', 'Guano', 'Parrots', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'human', 'left', 'population', 'reduced', 'zero.Surely', 'speculation', 'concerning', 'decaying', 'corpses', '6', '8', 'billion', 'people', 'laying', 'streets', 'houses', 'planet', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Maybe', 'new', 'organsims', 'feed', 'off', 'bacteria', 'human', 'flesh', 'will', 'flourish', 'result', 'new', 'complex', 'food', 'chain', 'human', 'corpses', 'being', 'base', 'progenitor.In', 'fact', 'what', 'first', 'episode', 'actually', 'just', 'cover', 'lot', 'other', 'questions', 'would', 'ask', 'subject', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'other', '5', 'discs', '2', 'seasons', '19', 'episodes', '800+', 'minutes', 'cover.I', 'already', 'spent', 'weekend', 'life', 'Alan', 'Weisman', 'book', 'so', 'way', 'pilot', 'episode', 'series', 'convinced', 'dedicate', '800+', 'minutes', 'more', 'life', 'revisit', 'what', 'already', 'read']","Life After People: The Series, Season 1"

A production that emphasizes the dissolution of buildings and monuments grows old--quick.  Yes, given enough time and without people to repair them, manmade structures ultimately turn into dust.  No great insight.  Should the human race suddenly disappear, for whatever reason, most cities and towns would largely burn to the ground in a few weeks or years.  Fires would start from equipment suddenly untended and fires would start from natural events like lightning and other forms of natural combustion.  Gutted buildings would be weakened and many would collapse rather quickly.Still this isn't very interesting.  More interesting would be the adaptation of animals and plants following human departure.  Would dogs and cats continue to live on indefinitely as feral species or would they ultimately go on to extinction because of more efficient wild competitors?  What about cattle, horses, goats and sheep?  Would any of them make it for long?  Yes, horses have gone 'wild' in many parts of the West but, thus far, few have been exposed to truly effective predators like wolves.How about animals that escape from the untended zoos?  Would lions, tigers, leopards and snow leopards become new native mammals?  Why or why not?  Would bison again roam the plains in their millions?  Would African and Asian elephants find a permanent home in the Americas?  Why or why not?  Would cheetahs again pursue pronghorn antelope?  Would eland and kudu browse the brushlands of America?What about the seas?  Which plants and animals there would thrive and which could be expected to go on to extinction in the absence of Man?  On land, which plants and animals, wild and domestic, would suffer reductions or extinctions without the protective influence of Man?  Which creatures would greatly increase in numbers with Man gone?  Like I say, the crumbling of buildings isn't very interesting.It would have been interesting to discuss some of the ways Man could go to extinction leaving his structures intact?  Warfare?  Obviously not.  Disease?  Much better possbility.  What if the HIV virus, for instance, mutated and became highly infective via airborne transmission?  In that the HIV virus usually produces no symptoms for approximately 9 years, the possibilities are horrific.  The virus is nearly 100% fatal [antivirals give some item of hope in developed countries] and, with an incubation period of 9 years, virtually everyone on earth could be infected before our medical scientists discovered that we were at the edge of an abyss.
