Liked her character during first season but as the show progressed she became sort of a duplicitous witch.  Robin McLeavey is great as Eva.  I have admired her ever since seeing her in the Aussie flick &#34;The Loved One&#34; where she totally chewed up the scenery and the other actors as a young girl from a very dysfunctional family.  Kasha Kopinski has stepped forward with a much bigger role as Ruth, the practicing missionary in the camp.  She isn't a lily white character and has failings but she does the best with what she has been dealt.  I'm glad to see Anson Mount becoming a bit more sensitive and his scenes with Kopinski are wonderful.  Suddenly, there are two people on the telly with chemistry.  The plotting has been grand this year and there has been more adventures in the telling.  Especially concerning Mr. Heyerdahl's evil character in relation to the little Mormon boy who has luckily come under the protection of Mr. Bohannon who sees his dead son lurking somewhere in the boy and has a very fatherly way of handling him.  At this point the boy, who rescued Bohannon from dying of thirst, has not told anybody what Heyerdahl did to him and his family after insinuating himself into their company traveling across the plains and I believe by the time he and Bohannon come into each others notice, there just may be more blood than last year's encounter.
