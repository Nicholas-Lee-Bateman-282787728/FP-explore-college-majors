21473,A2K3LZPH3ND94V,0767837991,"A. Davis ""asdav""","[8, 8]","Following the exploits of a good-hearted, booze-soaked clown who is trying to make his way in Palookaville, a town populated by denizens of that certain ditch in the entertainment world inhabited by clowns and mimes. He tries to kick the booze but his demons are hard to face. He gets involved in seedy intrigue with the tough, jaded rodeo clowns, picks on the mimes, and tries to avoid the indignity of doing balloon animals, all while keeping the bottle at bay lest he wake up puking into his frightwig. Oh yes, there's a love interest as well. Tasteless? Absolutely. Funny? If you know and love an alcoholic (or a clown), and you can still laugh about it, this movie will send you rolling off the couch and onto the floor in stitches. The relapse scene at the kids' pool party is alone worth the price of admission. A great cameo by Florence Henderson, and what may have been the last time Robin Williams was funny. Not for everyone, though, and let me state this for the record - NOT FOR THE KIDS!!! Got that?

Hartley,"[24, 26]","Pre-dating the much more popular ""Bad Santa"" by a good decade or so, Bobcat Goldthwait's sole directorial effort may have been a little too ahead of its time for its own good. Not that this is a groundbreaking piece of cinema, but within its narrow genre (Bitter Alcoholic Children's Entertainers) it has become a cult classic. Depending on your innate sense of humor, you will be either unspeakably shocked or wickedly delighted. Bobcat plays the title role fairly straight, considering the outrageousness of the story's central conceit. Something almost all reviews I've ever read seem to miss is the fact that Goldthwait's ""clowns"" are really a send-up of stand-up comedians, with all the backstage insecurity, jealously, pettiness and angst barely contained by the ""happy"" face paint (Maybe I recognize this underlying context because I used to work in stand up!)

Actually, there are four categories:  those who understand it as satire and appreciate it as such; those who understand that it's satire but are turned off by its ridiculousness and crudeness; those who think it's funny strictly for the crudeness (but don't get the satire); and those who simply don't like it and don't get it at all, considering it to be a complete waste of time.  If you're one of the people who is actually astute enough to appreciate the satire, cynical enough to agree with its dark worldview (and yet idealistic enough to believe in happy endings, however contrived), and silly enough to not consider yourself above a little scatological humor, this movie is for you, especially if your sense of humor leans towards the absurd (this group would likely include people who laugh out loud throughout ""Dr. Strangelove"" or fans of Monty Python who realize that the Ministry of Silly Walks is an indictment of the frivolous misspending inherent to a Socialist bureaucracy and that the Spam skit is a satire of food rationing in postwar Britain, and not just about silly voices and singing Vikings).In the satire ""Shakes the Clown,"" we observe a microcosm of the entertainment industry which doubles as a microcosm of society at large:  the rodeo clowns (most likely representing country & western singers / actors / entertainers [or any red state rural dwellers]); the mimes (Broadway actors / actresses [or blue state ""arty"" yuppies]); and the birthday party clowns (TV and B-movie actors / actresses [or the blue-collar working class of any political stripe]).  It is probably very telling in Goldthwait's usage of the clown motif just what he thinks about the entertainment industry and his place within it, but it is never less than on-point in its observations of societal schisms and how they are often rooted in class and culture differences.  And as dark, subversive satirical comedies go, it ranks up there with the first ""Friday"" movie (the only decent movie in that franchise), ""Bubba Ho-Tep,"" ""Bad Santa,"" and ""Borat,"" to name a few, and it shares their sense of the bizarre and the tasteless.

Let's face it; ""Shakes the Clown"" was an absolute  flop in the theaters, and Bobcat Golthwait gambled his career on the movie,  which never quite recovered. But since on video, ""Shakes the Clown"" has  gained a strong cult following as one of the funniest, irreverent,  misunderstood comedies of all time.There are 2 kinds of people in this  world; People who like ""Shakes the Clown"" and people who don't. Here's a  quiz to find out which camp you fall into: If you like Liam Neeson movies,  thought Julia Roberts was at her perkiest in the Runaway Bride, eat a lot  of low-fat food and don't understand most Adam Sandler jokes, this isn't  your movie. However, if you like South Park, if the Cable Guy was your  favorite Jim Carrey film, and can appreciate the brilliance of  well-constructed potty-humor, ""Shakes the Clown"" is right up your  alley.Bobcat is  Shakes the Clown; an alcoholic party clown that doesn't  know how to turn his life around. He hangs out in a dumpy clown-bar (""The  Twisted Balloon""), and vainly wishes he could be a television clown. All he  needs is one big break, but he's generally too drunk to do what's best for  himself, like practice his juggling and regular pie-throwing target  practice.Binky the clown is his arch nemesis; Binky is the suburban  party-clown that is used to things going his way. Binky is also busy  pushing dope he buys from the more rowdy Rodeo Clowns. Shakes ends up in  the wrong place during a bad drug deal and gets framed for killing a leader  of the clown community with a juggling pin.That's the basic plot and you  know by now whether you will enjoy the movie or not. In my opinion it's  absolutely brilliant and, even though crude at times, makes for an  interesting look at the different factions within society and how we behave  towards people from different backgrounds. It's not a cutesy  morale-building movie, but it's message is thinly cloaked with hilarious  dialogue and humor.Now I can finally sell my laserdisc player.....",5,YES YES YES!

21493,A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,0767837991,Raven A. Wind,"[0, 0]","Here's the deal: Bobcat Goldthwait has a sick sense of humor. He writes and directs some of the best black comedies out there. If you're not a slightly twisted individual, you won't appreciate what he offers. If you're a prude, you'll walk away from just about anything he's involved in feeling very offended.However, just because he's great at dark comedies doesn't mean he's lowbrow or dumb. In fact, even his early work, like Shakes The Clown, shows that he's actually a pretty deep thinker with a skill for pointing out the humor in the darker moments of life.While Shakes The Clown is not his best work (hey, he was just getting started at the time!) it is some of his more accessible work. This is in large part due to the fact that he got people like Julie Brown and Adam Sandler on-board. The plot is fairly simple: Alcoholic clown Shakes needs to shape up and finds himself framed for murder while trying to sober up and hang on to his girlfriend. What makes the movie work is the fact that Shakes and the other clowns all go to a clown bar, where various grease-painted entertainers hang out and unwind after a long day of performing for ungrateful children (and adults). The bar is the central location for the movie. It's where most of the action happens, and it's where Shakes' girlfriend happens to work when she's not bowling (Nevermind. You'll see.)Bobcat is always happy to degrade himself on screen, and he does it brilliantly here. Shakes is a total mess. A disgusting mess. A shameful mess. Bobcat sells the drunkenness and depravity, whether he's being peed on (Nevermind. You'll see.) or stumbling around in a drunken stupor. Yet he still manages to remain likable and not lose his status as the film's protagonist.I won't spoil this movie for you. Just trust me: If you're into dark comedies, Shakes The Clown is a good place to look for your fix, and then when you're done I suggest tracking down Bobcat Goldthwait's other movies. But be warned! If you're a thin-skinned, sensitive sort who dislikes violence, vice, or vulgarity, you should probably avoid this and other Bobcat Goldthwait movies.

Hedges,"[13, 20]","I really like Bobcat Goldthwait, but am forced to conclude that despite some funny sequences in 'Shakes', he is a vastly more talented standup comedian (his latest CD is wonderful) than film star/director. I think that the concept behind 'Shakes' is very funny, and the film had much greater potential than it ultimately realized as a satire of the dregs of society that clowns largely are. Actually watching the film though is occasionally funny, often painful.The guest spots, particularly the Florence Henderson role, were brilliant, and some of the interpersonal encounters between Shakes and others are very entertaining; for example, when Shakes is late for the children's party near the beginning of the film, and has a few words with the father that booked the event. Overall, though, especially in the clown bar, the dialogue is just not funny, and the characters other than Shakes (especially the execrable Adam Sandler) are just so annoying that not only do we not care about them, we dislike them intensely, and worse, just don't care what happens to them.The concept plus a few occasional strokes of genius are worth two stars, but it could have been so much better with a true comic genius like Bobcat at the helm. As a footnote, I HIGHLY recommend Bobcat's newest CD, &quot;I Don't Mean To Insult You, But You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait.&quot; It has a hysterical account of the movie, and a debate he had on the 'Today' show with Bamboozle the (real) clown which is a true gem of standup comedy, and far better than this movie itself.

It was a carefree time filled with great memories and some of the finest cinema the b market has to offer. As you may or may not know we just happen to be very seasoned in the arts of the genre known as ""so bad it's good"" and have pretty much revolved our lives around this concept. B has taught us there's no reason to take life too serious, especially when it comes to a raging alcoholic know as Shakes the Clown. The film had been something of a legend even since a young elf saw it on a movie channel in 1992. Since then it's been something talked about but never acted upon until now.Star of the evening Bobcat Goldthwait, who also wrote the film, plays a drunk clown known as Shakes who shows up to every kids party wasted out of his mind. Yeah obviously this is up our alley. After each gig he heads down to the local clown bar to meet up with his buddies, one being a very young Adam Sandler in one of is first roles, to get even further wasted despite his bosses threats of unemployment. Shakes then becomes a prime suspect when the boss turns up dead forcing him to get to the bottom of the murder to clear his name.In every sense Shakes the Clown is an absolute b masterpiece with no actually good qualities to the stuffy movie viewers. It moves in such a bizarre fashion that if you were on something while watching you'd surely freak out, especially with the amount a drunk clowns on camera. It had a stacked b cast consisting of 80's sensation Julie Brown, Kathy Griffin (who without trying actually looks like a clown), and young Sandler, and brief appearance from Robin Williams as a Mime. Without a doubt Shakes the Clown is a film that had to be done just off of sentimental value alone.
