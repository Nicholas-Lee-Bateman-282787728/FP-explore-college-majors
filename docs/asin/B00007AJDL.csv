The polar bear cubs are exquisite!Definitely worth the money- for kids or adults.",5,"Super DVD, beautiful cinematography",1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,445,"['love', 'watching', 'shows', 'animals', 'Animal', 'planet', 'Discovery', 'national', 'Geographic', 'can', 'be', 'heartwrenching', 'see', 'animals', 'get', 'stalked', 'killed', 'even', 'way', 'nature', 'intended', '.This', 'DVD', 'very', 'uplifting', 'watch', 'killing', 'only', 'happy', 'baby', 'animals', 'mothers.Not', 'sure', 'how', 'got', 'scenes', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'polar', 'bear', 'cubs', 'are', 'exquisite', 'Definitely', 'money-', 'kids', 'adults']",The World of Baby Animals

It is a documentary form, but it switches animals fast enough to keep my kids watching. It's so educational I decided to make it a part of their preschool class (I teach them). My kids are more mellow, and they just love animals- I'd recommend it to anyone! If your kids for some reason get bored with the documentary voice, maybe you can turn down the volume and play some nice music. This video is certainly worth the effort!!",5,VERY EDUCATIONAL!!,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,552,"['kids', 'LOVE', 'show', '3', 'half', 'hours-', 'even', 'found', 'fascinated', 'show-', 'money', 'documentary', 'form', 'animals', 'fast', 'enough', 'keep', 'kids', 'watching', 'so', 'educational', 'decided', 'make', 'part', 'preschool', 'class', 'teach', 'kids', 'are', 'more', 'mellow', 'just', 'love', 'animals-', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'kids', 'reason', 'get', 'bored', 'documentary', 'voice', 'maybe', 'can', 'turn', 'down', 'volume', 'play', 'nice', 'music', 'video', 'certainly', 'worth', 'effort']",The World of Baby Animals
