Season 9, thefinal Season on November 19, 2013. Most of the episodes are ok, and some of them are not so good. As a non-denominationalchristian, it saddens me that none of or very few of the episodes dwell on the disbelief of Lord Jesus Christ/or GOD period!!The ignorance of not knowing your creator is truly sad and unbelievable!!!! Let alone not even having a relationship with ourCreator. Most of all of these episodes dwell on &#34;Angels&#34; but do not dwell on where these celestial beings come from!!! they werecreated just as human beings; the universe; and this world we live in was created. I wish that the writers and executive producersspent more time concentrating on who GOD, OUR FATHER IS; LORD JESUS CHRIST; and LORD HOLY SPIRIT!! instead of dwellingon &#34;Angels&#34; and leaving &#34;GOD&#34; out of the picture!! The greatest purpose of life is living it to the fullest within GOD's WAY!!!!!  NotANGELS!!! (WHOM ARE MERELY MESSSENGERS)!!!!

You folks at Paramount must have been touched by an Angel. I specifically enjoyed the episode where Jesus, named Zack was convicted of murder in a small town, to protect a retarded man who accidently set a school fire, killing all the students.. Monica stops a few paces from him and gives a small bow. Forgive me, I didnt know who you were, she says. They hardly ever do, Monica, he answers. She asks why she wasnt able to recognize him. He answers her, because you would do anything for me, but look what you did for a stranger. And greater love hath no person, nor angel then to give her life for another. Well done good and faithful servant. Monica looks down, when she looks back up, Zack is gone, but the dove remains where it had been. Monica, crying hears the doves cry and looks down, as if seeing it for the first time.

CBS and Paramount has apparently dropped this idea, and will only be releasing ""collections"" of the episodes that are considered the ""best"". There are only 4 episodes on each set, some have been released on DVD already.I know I should be happy but I'm not. I assume this is for financial reasons (not like CBS and Paramount combined are hurting) and this is better than nothing but it is a lame attempt to appease the fans when nearly half of the series on DVD has been released already. Nearly every tv show known to man is being released on DVD, and they pull a stunt like this?
