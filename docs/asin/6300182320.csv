No, its a musical and as such the plot is a bit weak and the characters are 2 dimensional. Now as a musical is it good? Well there have been better but the music is pretty good and Olivia Newton John is good and Gene Kelly  well its Gene Kelly and he is in his last movie.  One of the highlights of the movie is Gene Kelly's dance number with Olivia. I will grant you that the movie has issues but You are not buying it for the gripping story. You're buying it to see Gene Kelly who almost outshines the two lead stars and dances. You're buying it for the music and the dance numbers.  You may even be an Olivia Newton John fan. To you people, I say go for it.  One last note. It is clearly an 80s movie and movie on a smallish budget.

201333,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,6300182320,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 0]","'Xanadu' is one of my favorite movies. And it's not because I see it as a guilty pleasure-sadly an opinion shared not only by fans and critics but by the actual film crew. As one of a minority of people who genuinely enjoys the early 80's glammy/disco culture 'Xanadu' is just great fun-the way a good musical should be. It's not a hugely deep movie. It's just the story of a frusterated commercial artist Sonny Malone (Michael Beck)who is suddenly inspired to follow his dreams when he's literally ""kissed by a muse"" on rollerskates,the mysterious Kira played by Olivia Newton John herself,who along with eight other muses's danced out of a mural in an alley. The two fall in love and Sonny,along with his friend Danny,played by the always brilliant Gene Kelly look to bridge the generation gap by combining the glitzy class of Danny's ""swinging 40's"" era along with the glam rock of Sonny's world. What the pair come to find is that not only had they both shared in Kira's passion at different times but that Kira is not supposed to fall in love,just inspire. So with the new multi generation roller disco Xanadu about to open Kira dissappears-claiming that as a muse the two must not fall in love.Sonny ends up skating into the mural to....a sci fi version of Mt.Olympus I suppose to profess his love for the muse who made his dreams possible and allow her to share in Xanadu's success. Because the Greek gods have no conception of what time means Kira and the other muses show up in the movies conclusion as part of one of the greatest dance routines/musical numbers on rollerskates in any musical and it's a happy ending for all. What you get with Xanadu is an updated version of the classic Hollywood musicals-complete with syncopated choreography (another one of the muses in the brilliant mural routine is the great Sandal Bergman),sparkling colorful fasions-from both the 40's and the 80's and lots of neon lights and spectacle. The choreography really lives up to the concept and the music provided by ELO and Olivia Newton John was so incredible that the soundtrack has gone down as a classic even if the film itself bombed. On a personal note I don't feel the film is the least bit kitchy or in bad taste;it's just from another era,one I frankly miss. The very 1980-style fasions are married to an interracial,often inter-sexual cast with hundreds of dancers,jugglers and skaters appearing throughout the film and the setup and choreography of the dance routines really have a very arty,surreal quality to them in many cases. There is something to be said for this type of theatrics if done well and this (if Xanadu's detractors will excuse me) is a fine example. 'Xanadu' is definately not for those who dislike early 80's dance theatrics or the disco culture-phobic but if you keep your mind open and let yourself just get lost in all the color and ""good vibes"" 'Xanadu' is truly a musical romantic fantasy for the ages!",5,A Musical Suspended In Time,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,2934,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'not', 'see', 'guilty', 'pleasure-sadly', 'opinion', 'shared', 'not', 'only', 'fans', 'critics', 'actual', 'film', 'crew', 'one', 'minority', 'people', 'who', 'genuinely', 'early', '80', 'glammy/disco', 'culture', 'just', 'great', 'fun-the', 'way', 'good', 'musical', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'hugely', 'deep', 'movie', 'just', 'story', 'frusterated', 'commercial', 'artist', 'Sonny', 'Malone', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'who', 'suddenly', 'inspired', 'follow', 'dreams', 'when', 'literally', 'kissed', 'muse', 'rollerskates', 'mysterious', 'Kira', 'played', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'who', 'eight', 'other', 'muses', 'danced', 'mural', 'alley', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'Sonny', 'friend', 'Danny', 'played', 'always', 'brilliant', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'look', 'bridge', 'generation', 'gap', 'combining', 'glitzy', 'class', 'Danny', 'swinging', '40', 'era', 'glam', 'rock', 'Sonny', 'world', 'What', 'pair', 'come', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'shared', 'Kira', 'passion', 'different', 'times', 'Kira', 'not', 'supposed', 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'inspire', 'So', 'new', 'multi', 'generation', 'roller', 'disco', 'Xanadu', 'open', 'Kira', 'dissappears-claiming', 'muse', 'two', 'must', 'not', 'fall', 'love.Sonny', 'up', 'skating', 'mural', '.a', 'sci', 'fi', 'version', 'Mt.Olympus', 'suppose', 'profess', 'love', 'muse', 'who', 'made', 'dreams', 'possible', 'allow', 'share', 'Xanadu', 'success', 'Greek', 'gods', 'have', 'conception', 'what', 'time', 'Kira', 'other', 'muses', 'show', 'up', 'movies', 'conclusion', 'part', 'one', 'greatest', 'dance', 'routines/musical', 'numbers', 'rollerskates', 'musical', 'happy', 'ending', 'What', 'get', 'Xanadu', 'updated', 'version', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'musicals-complete', 'syncopated', 'choreography', 'one', 'muses', 'brilliant', 'mural', 'routine', 'great', 'Sandal', 'Bergman', 'sparkling', 'colorful', 'fasions-from', '40', '80', 'lots', 'neon', 'lights', 'spectacle', 'choreography', 'really', 'up', 'concept', 'music', 'provided', 'ELO', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'was', 'so', 'incredible', 'soundtrack', 'gone', 'down', 'classic', 'even', 'film', 'bombed', 'personal', 'note', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'least', 'bit', 'kitchy', 'bad', 'taste', 'just', 'era', 'one', 'frankly', 'miss', 'very', '1980-style', 'fasions', 'are', 'married', 'interracial', 'often', 'inter-sexual', 'cast', 'hundreds', 'dancers', 'jugglers', 'skaters', 'appearing', 'film', 'setup', 'choreography', 'dance', 'routines', 'really', 'have', 'very', 'arty', 'surreal', 'quality', 'many', 'cases', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'type', 'theatrics', 'done', 'well', 'Xanadu', 'detractors', 'will', 'excuse', 'fine', 'example', 'definately', 'not', 'who', 'dislike', 'early', '80', 'dance', 'theatrics', 'disco', 'culture-phobic', 'keep', 'mind', 'open', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'lost', 'color', 'good', 'vibes', 'truly', 'musical', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'ages']",N/A

201336,A1BHFT19RSSJ3V,6300182320,A. R. Asson,"[1, 1]","Xanadu is an excellent vehicle for Olivia Newton John, better in my opinion than Grease.  The movie's foundational concept is the West Cost roller disco craze of the late 70's and early 80's, a concept that did not translate well in many other areas.  The mystical intersection between roller disco and Greek mythology also kept the movie out of the mainstream.  However the musical contributions by Jeff Lynne, Electric Light Orchestra, John Farrar, and Olivia Newton John are really quite good, but are largely overlooked because the movie was not well received.One reviewer criticized the movie by saying that, ""the only thing it showcases is her (ONJ's) total lack of screen charisma.""  I beg to strongly differ.  The singer always had a unique delivery, possibly because she was born in England and raised in Australia.  In any case, her performance is engaging.  She plays Terpsichore, the goddess of song and dance, although she never quite gets her name out of her mouth due to being interrupted by a kiss.  The nine Muses were Greek goddesses of the arts, daughters of Zeus.  How do you play a Greek goddess with roller skates on?  There aren't many precidents in the movies for this, but ONJ does quite an engaging job of it.Olivia Newton John was 32 when Zanadu was released, for my money at the height of her talents.  She had a much better voice than what has passed for a singing voice in popular music, talent that made her famous the world over.  And let's be honest, she was beautiful.  Gene Kelly was 68 when the movie was released, and could still move and dance with surprising grace and speed.  His character gives some depth and history to the story, necessary given the roller disco mythology concept.  He's an exceptional talent, both as an actor and as a dancer.  Michael Beck, ONJ's costar, really doesn't contribute much.  He's received unwelcome notoriety as a poor supporting actor in this and other rolls.  Probably his best role was in ""The Warriors.""  Also on the bill is James Sloyan, recognizable to Star Trek fans for several roles he played in the TV series.  Lastly, Sandahl Bergman of ""Conan the Barbarian"" fame dances as one of the nine Muses.  And boy, can she dance!It's a quirky movie.  If you like fantasy and music, you will probably enjoy Zanadu.  There are several song and dance sequences that are unique and clever, and the music is memorable.",4,"Good 80's music, great vehicle for Olivia Newton John",1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,2391,"['Xanadu', 'excellent', 'vehicle', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'better', 'opinion', 'Grease', 'movie', 'foundational', 'concept', 'West', 'Cost', 'roller', 'disco', 'craze', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'concept', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'areas', 'mystical', 'intersection', 'roller', 'disco', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'also', 'kept', 'movie', 'mainstream', 'However', 'musical', 'contributions', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'John', 'Farrar', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'largely', 'overlooked', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'received.One', 'reviewer', 'criticized', 'movie', 'saying', 'only', 'thing', 'ONJ', 'total', 'lack', 'screen', 'charisma', 'beg', 'strongly', 'differ', 'singer', 'always', 'had', 'unique', 'delivery', 'possibly', 'was', 'born', 'England', 'raised', 'Australia', 'case', 'performance', 'engaging', 'Terpsichore', 'goddess', 'song', 'dance', 'never', 'quite', 'name', 'mouth', 'due', 'being', 'interrupted', 'kiss', 'nine', 'Muses', 'were', 'Greek', 'goddesses', 'arts', 'daughters', 'Zeus', 'How', 'do', 'play', 'Greek', 'goddess', 'roller', 'skates', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'precidents', 'movies', 'ONJ', 'quite', 'engaging', 'job', 'it.Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'was', '32', 'when', 'Zanadu', 'was', 'released', 'money', 'height', 'talents', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'voice', 'what', 'passed', 'singing', 'voice', 'popular', 'music', 'talent', 'made', 'famous', 'world', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'beautiful', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'was', '68', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'could', 'still', 'move', 'dance', 'surprising', 'grace', 'speed', 'character', 'depth', 'history', 'story', 'necessary', 'given', 'roller', 'disco', 'mythology', 'concept', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'actor', 'dancer', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'ONJ', 'costar', 'really', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'much', 'received', 'unwelcome', 'notoriety', 'poor', 'supporting', 'actor', 'other', 'rolls', 'Probably', 'best', 'role', 'was', 'Warriors', 'Also', 'bill', 'James', 'Sloyan', 'recognizable', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'several', 'roles', 'played', 'TV', 'series', 'Lastly', 'Sandahl', 'Bergman', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'fame', 'one', 'nine', 'Muses', 'boy', 'can', 'dance', 'quirky', 'movie', 'like', 'fantasy', 'music', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'Zanadu', 'are', 'several', 'song', 'dance', 'sequences', 'are', 'unique', 'clever', 'music', 'memorable']",N/A
201337,A32T2H8150OJLU,6300182320,ARH,"[5, 5]","Xanadu came out in 1980 when popular culture (music, dress, etc.) was trying to figure out what to do as disco died in the late 1970s.  The movie ""Xanadu"" filled part of that void, providing some of the top music hits of 1980, including the #1 song ""Magic,"" performed by Olivia Newton John (ONJ) and ELO.The movie, standing alone, well, bombs...especially in light of today's special effects, soundtracks, etc.  So, if you are watching Xanadu for the first time chances are good that you will be at least a little disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you saw Xanadu in context, back in the 1980s, the movie will still strike home as a defining moment in the middle of a sort of cultural void.As for the movie itself...here's the scoop:A young, talented, So. Cal., contract painter (Beck) is discouraged, and goes looking for inspiration.  Consequently, a mural of the Muses, the nine Greek godesses of art, literature, and sciences, magically come to life.  Beck crosses paths with one of them (ONJ) and is smitten.  The rest of the story centers on a chance meeting between Beck and an aging musician (Gene Kelly), and their plan to open a night club.  ONJ provides the inspiration, and the two friends push forward with their plans to convert an old auditorium into a club.You'll have to watch the movie yourself to see how it all turns out...to see whether Beck and ONJ are able to get together, to see who's dream ONJ is there to help motivate and inspire, and to see if the club even opens.Oh, by the way, be advised that there is a somewhat pointless animated segment in the middle of the movie, but it is accompanied by some good music.The movie probably rates 1-2 stars, but the staying power of ONJ, the ONJ/ELO combo, and the timing of the movie in light of cultural shift are worth probably 4 stars...for an overall rating of 3 stars...at the most.Well, I like it, but I also know it's not, critically speaking, ""good.""",3,"Not a 5-star movie, but still...a fun time",1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1931,"['Xanadu', 'came', 'out', '1980', 'when', 'popular', 'culture', 'music', 'dress', 'etc', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'disco', 'died', 'late', '1970s', 'movie', 'Xanadu', 'filled', 'part', 'void', 'providing', 'top', 'music', 'hits', '1980', 'including', '1', 'song', 'Magic', 'performed', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'ONJ', 'ELO.The', 'movie', 'standing', 'alone', 'well', 'bombs', 'especially', 'light', 'today', 'special', 'effects', 'soundtracks', 'etc', 'So', 'are', 'watching', 'Xanadu', 'first', 'time', 'chances', 'are', 'good', 'will', 'be', 'least', 'little', 'disappointed', 'other', 'hand', 'saw', 'Xanadu', 'context', 'back', '1980s', 'movie', 'will', 'still', 'strike', 'home', 'defining', 'moment', 'middle', 'sort', 'cultural', 'void.As', 'movie', 'here', 'scoop', 'young', 'talented', 'So', 'Cal.', 'contract', 'painter', 'Beck', 'discouraged', 'looking', 'inspiration', 'Consequently', 'mural', 'Muses', 'nine', 'Greek', 'godesses', 'art', 'literature', 'sciences', 'magically', 'come', 'life', 'Beck', 'paths', 'one', 'ONJ', 'smitten', 'rest', 'story', 'centers', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Beck', 'aging', 'musician', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'plan', 'open', 'night', 'club', 'ONJ', 'inspiration', 'two', 'friends', 'push', 'forward', 'plans', 'convert', 'old', 'auditorium', 'club.You', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'see', 'Beck', 'ONJ', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'together', 'see', 'who', 'dream', 'ONJ', 'there', 'help', 'motivate', 'inspire', 'see', 'club', 'even', 'opens.Oh', 'way', 'be', 'advised', 'somewhat', 'pointless', 'animated', 'segment', 'middle', 'movie', 'accompanied', 'good', 'music.The', 'movie', 'probably', 'rates', '1-2', 'stars', 'staying', 'power', 'ONJ', 'ONJ/ELO', 'combo', 'timing', 'movie', 'light', 'cultural', 'shift', 'are', 'worth', 'probably', '4', 'stars', 'overall', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'most.Well', 'like', 'also', 'know', 'not', 'critically', 'speaking', 'good']",N/A

201340,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,6300182320,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[20, 25]","XANADU is one of the most critically and commercially ravaged films in Hollywood history, a 'Nouveau Art' musical with Art Deco themes, a weirdly conceived animated interlude, and performances of such widely varying caliber that a viewer might wonder if the actors were all reading the same script! But all that being said, I would like to offer a minority opinion, and say that I didn't find the film THAT terrible, and there are some aspects of it I actually enjoyed...First and foremost, it offers the legendary Gene Kelly, in his last musical, as charming and wonderful as ever. As retired musician/businessman Danny McGuire, Kelly has the film's best moments, including a 'classic' song-and-dance scene with Olivia Newton-John and some silly but endearing 'post-disco' routines with the talented young dancers of the cast (including future CONAN star Sandahl Bergman). Seeing him on roller-skates again, leading everyone around the club he builds, to the music of the Electric Light Orchestra, makes one realize just how irreplaceable he is. Kelly could do it all, and with style!The premise of the film, of a Muse coming from Olympus to inspire an artist, is farfetched, but had been done on film several times in the past (ONE TOUCH OF VENUS, with Ava Gardner and Robert Walker, and DOWN TO EARTH, with Rita Hayworth, are the examples most often mentioned), and while Olivia Newton-John is oddly cast in the role, she tackles it gamely, with a smile and a wink, and isn't THAT bad. On the other hand, Michael Beck, best-known as the gang leader in clich&eacute;d but powerful THE WARRIORS, is totally miscast as the artist she falls in love with. An actor with limited range and no singing or dancing talent, Beck lacks the charisma to pull off the role (one wonders why British pop star Cliff Richard, who voices Beck's duet with Newton-John, 'Suddenly', wasn't utilized to play the part).While the film often veers off in bizarre directions, the 'Battle of the Bands' scene between popular 80s rockers, the Tubes, and a 'Tommy Dorsey'-style orchestra (as Beck and Kelly envision what the 'look' and 'sound' of their club, XANADU, should be), actually works, and is fun to watch. The entire score, by Barry De Vorzon and John Farrar, and Jeff Lynne (with ELO) is terrific (and made the soundtrack album a hit).Sure, the ending is hokey, but it was also the same ending of ONE TOUCH OF VENUS and DOWN TO EARTH, so XANADU can't be totally faulted!All in all, XANADU isn't the WORST film ever made, and if you give it a chance, you might find it a guilty pleasure!",3,XANADU a Guilty Pleasure!,1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,2569,"['XANADU', 'one', 'most', 'critically', 'commercially', 'ravaged', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'history', ""'Nouveau"", 'Art', 'musical', 'Art', 'Deco', 'themes', 'weirdly', 'conceived', 'animated', 'interlude', 'performances', 'such', 'widely', 'varying', 'caliber', 'viewer', 'might', 'wonder', 'actors', 'were', 'reading', 'same', 'script', 'being', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'offer', 'minority', 'opinion', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'THAT', 'terrible', 'are', 'aspects', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'First', 'foremost', 'legendary', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'last', 'musical', 'charming', 'wonderful', 'ever', 'retired', 'musician/businessman', 'Danny', 'McGuire', 'Kelly', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'including', ""'classic"", 'song-and-dance', 'scene', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'silly', 'endearing', ""'post-disco"", 'routines', 'talented', 'young', 'dancers', 'cast', 'including', 'future', 'CONAN', 'star', 'Sandahl', 'Bergman', 'Seeing', 'roller-skates', 'again', 'leading', 'everyone', 'club', 'music', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'one', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'irreplaceable', 'Kelly', 'could', 'do', 'style', 'premise', 'film', 'Muse', 'coming', 'Olympus', 'inspire', 'artist', 'farfetched', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'past', 'ONE', 'TOUCH', 'OF', 'VENUS', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'DOWN', 'TO', 'EARTH', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'are', 'examples', 'most', 'often', 'mentioned', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'oddly', 'cast', 'role', 'gamely', 'smile', 'wink', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'bad', 'other', 'hand', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'best-known', 'gang', 'leader', 'clich', 'eacute', 'powerful', 'THE', 'WARRIORS', 'totally', 'miscast', 'artist', 'love', 'actor', 'limited', 'range', 'singing', 'dancing', 'talent', 'Beck', 'charisma', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'one', 'why', 'British', 'pop', 'star', 'Cliff', 'Richard', 'who', 'Beck', 'duet', 'Newton-John', ""'Suddenly"", 'was', ""n't"", 'utilized', 'play', 'part', 'film', 'often', 'off', 'bizarre', 'directions', ""'Battle"", 'Bands', 'scene', 'popular', '80s', 'rockers', 'Tubes', ""'Tommy"", ""Dorsey'-style"", 'orchestra', 'Beck', 'Kelly', 'envision', 'what', ""'look"", ""'sound"", 'club', 'XANADU', 'should', 'be', 'actually', 'fun', 'watch', 'entire', 'score', 'Barry', 'De', 'Vorzon', 'John', 'Farrar', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'ELO', 'terrific', 'made', 'soundtrack', 'hit', '.Sure', 'ending', 'hokey', 'was', 'also', 'same', 'ending', 'ONE', 'TOUCH', 'OF', 'VENUS', 'DOWN', 'TO', 'EARTH', 'so', 'XANADU', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'totally', 'faulted', 'XANADU', ""n't"", 'WORST', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'give', 'chance', 'might', 'find', 'guilty', 'pleasure']",N/A

Why Holy Trinity?  All of these movies are awful, strange, and enjoyable because they're so awful and strange.  In addition, these three films not only put the final nail in the coffin of the movie musical (a form badly wounded already by ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" in 1978 and ""The Wiz""), but also drove a stake through the heart of the fresh corpse of disco.""Xanadu"" has barely any plot and no characterization whatsoever.  A lazy artist halfheartedly goes about his day job of designing record album covers.  Kids, ask your parents.  Of course, he's bored, you know, working 9-5 for The Man of rock 'n' roll, designing cool covers for hot music.  Who would want to do that?  He has some undefined, general idea that he wants to do some other kind of art, even though he has no demostrable talent and no drive whatsoever.  Because it's in the script, Olivia Newton-John, an immortal muse, falls in love with him and has to have him, so she comes to Earth like Rollergirl and starts roller disco-ing at random times with him.  Meanwhile, our hero (and I use this term not because he displays any heroic qualities, but because the script would have us believe that he's the protagonist) randomly meets Gene Kelly.  Kelly, being rich and talented, almost immediately decides to make our hero partners with him in a fancy new roller disco place, even though our hero has no money to invest and apparently does nothing to justify this partnership.  Our hero just drifts into this lucky situation, like everything in this movie; he never once has to make a decision or take a chance.  They open the disco, it's a success, and the movie's over.  Hope that didn't spoil anything for anyone.So what's good about ""Xanadu""?  The music, for one thing.  ELO and Olivia sound fantastic and do some of their best work on the soundtrack.  At least it's shot kind of interestingly; in places, this film feels more like a sequence of early-vintage music videos stitched together than some kind of coherent narrative.  Because the music's pretty good, it carries you along and gives you the energy and will to stay with the rest of the movie and mock it relentlessly.  Good movie?  Heck, no!

The director was obviously busy doing something else. The choreography is laughably dated. The special effects -- including Olivia Newton John's ""youthful"" appearance -- are cheap and ugly. The songs are catchy, but still utter crap. And lastly, did Olivia Newton John, Michael Beck or Gene Kelly spend any rehearsal time on roller skates before the cameras started rolling? The three of them are clearly uncomfortable on wheels, awkward and clumsy --especially ONJ and Beck; in a few spots both actors appear close to taking a spill. All that being said, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I didn't see XANADU when it was released in 1980; in fact, haven't seen it until November 2007. A feature article in Entertainment Weekly magazine on the new Broadway musical based on the movie is what interested me. ""Could this movie be as bad as everyone says it is?"" I asked myself. Well, yes. And no. The movie is a classic piece of ineptitude, but it is fun in spite of itself. It inspires the same sort of embarrassed enjoyment that hearing an REO Speedwagon song does: if we're with friends we laugh at it; if we're alone, we know every lyric and sing along. We might be a bit embarrassed, but it's not hurting anybody else (unless, of course, the neighbors can hear).",4,Junk food for the soul,1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,1394,"['What', 'movie', 'acting', 'such', 'never', 'what', ""'d"", 'experience', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'director', 'was', 'obviously', 'busy', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'choreography', 'laughably', 'dated', 'special', 'effects', 'including', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'youthful', 'appearance', 'are', 'cheap', 'ugly', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'still', 'utter', 'crap', 'lastly', 'did', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'spend', 'rehearsal', 'time', 'roller', 'skates', 'cameras', 'started', 'rolling', 'three', 'are', 'clearly', 'uncomfortable', 'wheels', 'awkward', 'clumsy', 'especially', 'ONJ', 'Beck', 'few', 'spots', 'actors', 'appear', 'close', 'taking', 'spill', 'being', 'said', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'XANADU', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1980', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'November', '2007', 'feature', 'article', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'magazine', 'new', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'based', 'movie', 'what', 'interested', 'Could', 'movie', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'asked', 'Well', 'yes', 'movie', 'classic', 'piece', 'ineptitude', 'fun', 'spite', 'same', 'sort', 'embarrassed', 'enjoyment', 'hearing', 'REO', 'Speedwagon', 'song', ""'re"", 'friends', 'laugh', ""'re"", 'alone', 'know', 'lyric', 'sing', 'along', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'embarrassed', 'not', 'hurting', 'anybody', 'else', 'course', 'neighbors', 'can', 'hear']",N/A

I've worn out two VHS videos, and am now, even while typing this, watching my Xanadu DVD.  I can't believe that anyone would call this undiscovered wonder of the world &quot;wimpy&quot; or &quot;anemic&quot;.  This movie deserves its current status as a cult classic.The Stars.  I'll have more to say about Gene Kelly later.  Olivia Newton John, still on the top of her conversion from Country Western to Pop Rock, never sounded or looked better.  Her ability to seemingly switch back and forth on a moments notice from her old image of sweetness and nice to her new image of almost a dominatrix was great.  Her combination of any boy's fantasies with a girl you could take home was wonderful.  Mike Beck does a good job as &quot;Sonny&quot; - the modern-day version of Danny McGuire, although, in comparison to Kelly and Olivia, he looks kind of flat.  But who could hold a candle to that caliber of actor or actress?The scenes.  The scene where Danny dances with Kira and ends up with her in his arms (&quot;Whenever You're Away from Me&quot;), followed by a similar scene with Sonny and Kira minutes later in the movie (&quot;Suddenly&quot;), only help to reinforce the Deja-Vu like sense of wonder that permeates this entire film.  We are treated to this sense of deja-vu over and over again.  The scene where the Big Band era meets the rock-and-roll era still gives me a thrill.  Olivia Newton John's singing blends virtually perfectly with Electric Light Orchestra's symphonic sound, but heavy rock influence.The musical numbers.  Done by Electric Light Orchestra and Olivia Newton John, they include the pop hits &quot;Xanadu&quot; and &quot;Magic&quot;, as well as: &quot;I'm Alive&quot;, &quot;All Over The World&quot;, &quot;Dancin' Round and Round&quot;,  &quot;Suspended in Time&quot;, &quot;Whenever You're Away from Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Walk Away&quot;  and &quot;Suddenly&quot;.  Imagine, if you can, a blending of the best of the 30's and 40's Big Bands with the best of the 70's and 80's rock and disco.  Now imagine it on the same stage - blended almost perfectly.  That =is= what happens in this movie.The dancing.  What can anyone say about Gene Kelly that hasn't been said already?  Watching Gene trip the light fantastic with Olivia was worth the price of admission all by itself.  This was, I believe, Gene Kelly's last movie, and it is a fitting send-off to his long career.  It was kind of fun to see him as a clarinet player and construction company boss.  He doesn't look the least bit &quot;silly&quot; - it's easy to see where he could have been Kira's love interest back in the 40's.  It was appropriate to see Gene's character called &quot;Danny McGuire&quot; as that was actually the name of one of Gene's characters in another movie.In addition, to cap off this film, Don Bluth did the animation for a wonderful sequence (&quot;Don't Walk Away&quot;) where Kira and Sonny are transformed into fish and birds.  This provides a perfect sense of surreal to Sonny's and Kira's developing love.This movie means more than its outer shell of &quot;a muse is sent from 'heaven' to help with the creation of a disco roller derby&quot;.  It means it's OK to have dreams - because a dream is a wish your heart makes.  The emphasis, told in various ways, that you should always follow your dreams, is a message that needs to be emphasised today.  Both Danny's dream of opening a new club, and Sonny's dream to do something more than his boring job of painting recreations of album covers are fused together by Kira (or should I say &quot;Terpsichore&quot;? :-) into a single dream that they, with her help, make a reality.  Do a search on the Greek Muses and you'll find a lot of the inspiration for this movie.If there really is a real Xanadu, I would love to go there.

201352,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,6300182320,Carlisle Wheeling,"[2, 2]","Okay, I really like Olivia Newton-John because she is beautiful and talented, so I'm hard pressed to say I like this movie.  On the other hand...well, look at it!  It was 1980, I was sixteen, and you know how that goes.  I never got to see it in the theater, but maybe that's not such a bad thing.  You can rent it these days and the corny neon special effects are a bit much on a regular television, hi-def or not.  The music is great, I'll give you that, but without it, the storyline (or lack of one) doesn't hold the interest a big budget musical should.  True, it's ten times better than Sgt. Pepper (eegad!), and it is a walk down memory lane for those of us who heard the songs on the radio constantly and recall how popular roller rinks and the last days of disco were.  But that wardrobe!  What's with all the girly bag lady clothes the Lovely Livvy was wearing, especially as healthy and trim as she's always been.  Despite that, she never looked more beautiful.  Gene Kelly was wonderful with what little he had to work with, but I keep wondering why he signed on for this thing since I seriously doubt he needed the money.  His clothes were even worse in the ""All Over the World"" number.  Michael Beck?  Dear God, I've seen him in a few other movies before he seemingly vanished forever, and I would like to paraphrase an album review from the movie Spinal Tap:  ""On what day did the Lord create Michael Beck, and couldn't he have rested on that day too?""  Sorry, kids, he was cute, but he couldn't act, and he wouldn't have been convincing in a preschooler's pageant.Apparently Beck's character Sonny Malone is bored sick of painting album covers.  Yeah, he ought to try working 12 years in a rifle reloading factory like I did and see how boring his job is then.  He has no money and no real ambition, so the Greek god Zeus sends him his roller skating daughter Kira (Olivia) to inspire him and Kelly's character to open a nightclub that caters to both the big band 40s crowd and the roller disco and rock crowd.  Not very exciting, is it?  Why are these two partners anyway?  Sonny has no money or ambition to even paint, and Kelly has all the money, so what's he get out of it besides maybe a sense of updated youth?  Olivia Newton-John's character supposedly inspired Danny (Kelly's character) many years earlier, but that's one of the only glimpses we get of a movie that could have been better than it is.  The number ""When You're Away From Me,"" is a hint that one of the writers of this confused mish-mash did something right, because the number is charming and the dancing between Kelly and ONJ is the brightest spot in the film.Other than that, there are overly long dance numbers with outdated clothes and dancing styles, you know very well you're in 1980, especially if you were there.  The ending is very confusing.  Is that really Kira, or is that someone who looks and sounds a lot like her?  Like how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop, the world may never know.  Or care.  Still, for as convulluted and confusing as it is, I watch it once in a while...then I wonder why.  I guess I can't resist feeling like a teenager again, albeit one with a stomach ache.  It all boils down to this; if you love ONJ, you will sit through this a few times.  If you miss a simpler time to the point that even this movie seems like ""Magic"" to you, you will sit through it a few times.  Then there are the times when someone brings this movie up and makes fun of it for very obvious reasons, and you will give it a big, emphatic no!  I guess it just depends on your mood.  No the movie isn't good, but I've seen far worse things, so a solid three stars it is.",3,Is it Noxtalgia or a Driving Need for Xantac?

Harmer,"[3, 4]","When XANADU was released circa 1980, I was just a little girl in grade school circa 1980, and all my friends rushed out to see this movie.  They came back addicted to roller skating and pretending to be Olivia.  Since I missed out, I didn't understand it all.Now that it's taken some 20-odd years for me to see this film, I'm piecing it all together.  You see, there isn't a whole lotta plot.  We meet Sonny, a frustrated artist whose creative juices are stifled, and Kira, a muse come to life who leaped off the mural and into Sonny's life to do what muses are supposed to do...inspire.  Then Gene Kelly is thrown into the mix as a washed-out singer/dancer/musician.  These characters are set against a backdrop of roller skating, disco music, roller discos, glitter balls, and far-out graphics.  XANADU is the end result of the amalgamation of these aforementioned individuals and forms of entertainment.To watch this movie, you would fall under the impression that disco and roller skating (pre-rollerblade roller skating, that is) would rule the world forever.  Now I know why my friends broke out the roller skates: Because it really gets you fired up and eager to glide 'round a dark rink under the twinkling lights of the glitter ball with a spunky Gene Kelly blazing the way for the roller-congo line.  But alas, the irony is that XANADU did not perpetuate disco; rather, it extolled disco's last gasp. I think this film would have been a bigger hit had it been released two or three years earlier in the late 70's; perhaps then it would have perpetuated the disco craze.  And yet...the film was fun, despite its weaknesses, and it was nice to go back to a less cynical time.",3,A fun romp back to a less cynical time,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,1683,"['When', 'XANADU', 'was', 'released', 'circa', '1980', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'girl', 'grade', 'school', 'circa', '1980', 'friends', 'rushed', 'out', 'see', 'movie', 'came', 'back', 'addicted', 'roller', 'skating', 'pretending', 'be', 'Olivia', 'missed', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'all.Now', 'taken', '20-odd', 'years', 'see', 'film', ""'m"", 'piecing', 'together', 'see', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lotta', 'plot', 'meet', 'Sonny', 'frustrated', 'artist', 'creative', 'juices', 'are', 'stifled', 'Kira', 'muse', 'come', 'life', 'who', 'leaped', 'off', 'mural', 'Sonny', 'life', 'do', 'what', 'muses', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'inspire', 'Then', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'thrown', 'mix', 'washed-out', 'singer/dancer/musician', 'characters', 'are', 'set', 'backdrop', 'roller', 'skating', 'disco', 'music', 'roller', 'discos', 'glitter', 'balls', 'far-out', 'graphics', 'XANADU', 'end', 'result', 'amalgamation', 'aforementioned', 'individuals', 'forms', 'entertainment.To', 'watch', 'movie', 'would', 'fall', 'impression', 'disco', 'roller', 'skating', 'pre-rollerblade', 'roller', 'skating', 'would', 'rule', 'world', 'forever', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'friends', 'broke', 'out', 'roller', 'skates', 'really', 'fired', 'up', 'eager', 'glide', 'dark', 'rink', 'twinkling', 'lights', 'glitter', 'ball', 'spunky', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'blazing', 'way', 'roller-congo', 'line', 'alas', 'irony', 'XANADU', 'did', 'not', 'perpetuate', 'disco', 'rather', 'extolled', 'disco', 'last', 'gasp', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bigger', 'hit', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'late', '70', 'perhaps', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'perpetuated', 'disco', 'craze', 'yet', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'weaknesses', 'was', 'nice', 'go', 'back', 'less', 'cynical', 'time']",N/A

201357,A18G7GG53G2X8A,6300182320,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 4]","I'm afraid my recommendation for the musical fantasy ""Xanadu"" is based solely on my own personal tastes. When analyzed from a strictly cinematic point of view, it is a pretty bad film: the performances were less than stellar, the story was weak, the dialogue was awful, and the ending was completely ill fitting (not to mention nonsensical). And let's not forget the special effects, which are so unflatteringly dated. It's easy to see why the critics had a field day with this and why it did so poorly at the box office.So then why did I enjoy it so much, and why do so many others enjoy it as well? I suppose most of that is due to the music. The soundtrack certainly pays homage to the synthesizer-laden pop ballads and the generally upbeat rhythms that the 1980s were known for. And despite a bland and clich'd story, the songs are quite catchy; it's no wonder the soundtrack found its niche on radio, putting Olivia Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra back into the mainstream with hits like ""I'm Alive,"" ""Magic,"" and the film's title song. ""Xanadu"" is like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in that its music makes it appealing; without it, it would be one of the most miserable movie going experiences out there.What we have here is a classic Love Conquers All story, a fable about a boy and a girl from two very different worlds overcoming all obstacles to be together. Sounds familiar, right? In the case of this movie, the boy is a human being and the girl is a muse, a mythical Greek figure meant to inspire. When down-on-his-luck artist Sonny Malone (Michael Beck) abandons all hope at the prospect of his dreams coming true, he settles for dead end work as a painter of enlarged album covers (the kind that used to be hung outside of music stores).This prompts the awakening of all nine muses; for whatever reason, they come to life within a mural on a building located near the Los Angeles coastline. It's a highly choreographed number, and they are all surrounded by a bright purple glow. Afterwards, they all go their separate ways while one stays behind. Here enters Kira (Olivia Newton-John), the muse assigned to help Sonny on his way. At first she teases him with small glimpses as she skates along the sidewalk, always with a cheery smile on her face. They finally end up meeting in an abandoned wrestling rink, the famous L.A. landmark (since destroyed) designed in the Art Deco style. It is there that the magic, for everyone involved, begins to unfold.Another pivotal character is Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly), a former jazz musician who longs to return to his swinging nightclub days. He crosses paths with Sonny on the beach, and that's where Danny's character is established; he's supposed to be a modernized version of the Wise Old Man, an experienced person who can give Sonny meaningful advice. But there's a twist: his desire for the good ol' days brings Kira into his life as well as Sonny's. This is first noticed in a 1940s style dance sequence in which Danny fantasizes he's tap dancing with Kira. The connection is never adequately explained, but enough of it is revealed to get the point across.After all is said and done, it's decided that a new nightclub will open. It's called Xanadu, and its theme is a very eclectic mix of the '40s and '80s, with zoot suits and Art Deco architecture mingling with roller disco light effects. It's an odd place, but it's also lively and entertaining, and it offers a wide variety of musical styles. At one point Kira and her sisters perform a medley, ranging from rock 'n' roll to country/western. On the one hand it's incredibly inappropriate while on the other it's so campy that you just can't help but watch.Before the club opens, Sonny and Danny scout locations for its site. As you could have probably guessed, they pick the abandoned wrestling rink. (Why else would the filmmakers have Sonny and Kira meet there? For convenience's sake?) Pacing through the gigantic, empty main room, they begin to envision what kind of club they'd prefer to see. What follows is a sort of musical competition. In the right corner, we have Danny's 1940s jazz club, full of class, style, and elegance. In the left corner, we have Sonny's 1980s rock club, electrically charged and pulsing with energy (with a cameo by The Tubes as the band). The visions keep going back and forth until they merge, hence the club's final theme mentioned earlier. The choreography in this scene is so frenetic and cluttered that it became difficult to determine what they were trying to accomplish. On the other hand, it was a fun scene, and the music they play during it is just dancey enough to get you off your seat.The list of things that are wrong with this movie is a particularly long one. Yes, some of them are so obvious that they're just begging to be pointed out and mocked (like a completely unnecessary animated sequence by Don Bluth). But underneath all the flaws, there's also a bright, shiny charm, one that comes from the film's message of following your dreams no matter what. It's an overused and unenlightening message, of course, but the fact that it rings true makes it worthwhile. (How often have you been told something you already knew but needed to hear anyway?) And I could see the potential it had, especially since it has such great music.Let me put it this way: I've certainly seen worse movies than ""Xanadu."" It may be light and airy, but it's pleasingly light and airy. If a serious film is what you seek, then this is definitely not something to consider; that kind of attitude will only leave you asking, ""What does Samuel Colridge's vision of Xanadu have to do with a time warped roller disco?"" But if you're looking to escape from the real world and lose yourself in pure fantasy and music, then by all means, give it a go. It's the kind of film that doesn't pressure you to analyze it too deeply or to take it too seriously. And thank goodness for that; sometimes, we're just not in the mood.",4,A Flawed Piece of Paradise,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,5975,"[""'m"", 'afraid', 'recommendation', 'musical', 'fantasy',

It's a crashing bore (96 torturous minutes), the acting is amateurish (if you think Al Gore  is stiff, check out Michael Beck's acting), the choreography is numbingly  bad, and the &quot;special effects&quot; are so embarassing and sickeningly  sugary to watch that you'll be cringing in your seat on your way to a most  certain diabetic coma!

201361,A3NQ9N2OO60JGP,6300182320,"Dale E. Hopkins, II","[9, 11]","Well, I was a bit skeptical about this release. I mean, how much money are you going to throw at the remastering of a film that was critically reviled and a box office bomb? The answer is: Not much. Still, I think they did a good job with what they could afford. The picture quality is an improvement over the version released in 1999. The images aren't as low-contrast and there isn't as much dirt on the print. The image quality is still a bit soft, but I attribute some of that to the quality of film stock they used when they filmed it.This is where it gets tricky-- the soundtrack on the previous version was a bit of a mess. The music sounded ultra-compressed and muddy at times. Other times, it sounded great. The worst offender was the first number, ""I'm Alive"". For whatever reason, this song never sounded as good in the film as it did on the soundtrack. I'm not exactly sure why that is. I am pleased to announce that the mix is fairly well improved. It still sounds a bit squashed but the lows boom without being overbearing and the highs sparkle. ""All Over the World"" has a bizarre sound mix where the back up vocals are largely relegated to the back of the mix and are barely audible at times. If you know this song, you'll notice that they are missing. Also blended back are some of the instruments in Olivia's ""Suspended in Time"" number. It's interesting to compare the 5.1 mix to the French 2-track mix, which is also an entirely different mix. In that mix, some of the background vocals are mixed way up front and some of the harmony lines are more present in tracks like ""Don't Walk Away"".The trailer attached to this is the same one as in the previous release. They didn't clean this up at all and, for what it's worth, it's no surprise that no one came to this film. It's a terrible trailer!!!The high point of the DVD is the mini-doco. There are confessions, revelations and grumbles as well as a bit of celebration and appreciation for the film that won't die. Olivia Newton-John and Michael Beck are sadly absent from this but there are a few dancers, the production crew and Gene Kelly's widow present to help you understand why this movie failed but also succeeded in the afterlife of video rental and late night cable.One other bit they attached to this is a little photo gallery. The frame isn't very big so most of the pictures are smaller than you'd like. It's still nice to see some production photos and some never-before seen shots from the film.Lastly, the packaging is embarrassing. I wish that it wasn't quite so tacky. The original release sported a reprint of the original movie poster. It wasn't the most eye-catching packaging but at least it was authentic. The bonus CD is exactly the same disc that was remastered and released on MCA records a few years ago. Not to take away from the Amazon bundle that's currently being hawked, but there's no reason for you to buy the soundtrack in addition to this release. It's already included.All in all, it's a nifty little re-release. If you are a fan of the film or a fan of the ""spec-tacky-lar"" musical numbers, I'd totally recommend getting this edition.",4,"""Xanadu"" - Redux!",1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3141,"['Well', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'release', 'mean', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'are', 'going', 'throw', 'remastering', 'film', 'was', 'critically', 'reviled', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'answer', 'Not', 'much', 'Still', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'could', 'afford', 'picture', 'quality', 'improvement', 'version', 'released', '1999', 'images', 'are', ""n't"", 'low-contrast', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'dirt', 'print', 'image', 'quality', 'still', 'bit', 'soft', 'attribute', 'quality', 'film', 'stock', 'used', 'when', 'filmed', 'it.This', 'where', 'tricky', 'soundtrack', 'previous', 'version', 'was', 'bit', 'mess', 'music', 'sounded', 'ultra-compressed', 'muddy', 'times', 'Other', 'times', 'sounded', 'great', 'worst', 'offender', 'was', 'first', 'number', ""'m"", 'Alive', 'reason', 'song', 'never', 'sounded', 'good', 'film', 'did', 'soundtrack', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'why', 'am', 'pleased', 'announce', 'mix', 'fairly', 'well', 'improved', 'still', 'bit', 'squashed', 'lows', 'boom', 'being', 'overbearing', 'highs', 'sparkle', 'World', 'bizarre', 'sound', 'mix', 'where', 'back', 'up', 'vocals', 'are', 'largely', 'relegated', 'back', 'mix', 'are', 'barely', 'audible', 'times', 'know', 'song', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'are', 'missing', 'Also', 'blended', 'back', 'are', 'instruments', 'Olivia', 'Suspended', 'Time', 'number', 'interesting', 'compare', '5.1', 'mix', 'French', '2-track', 'mix', 'also', 'entirely', 'different', 'mix', 'mix', 'background', 'vocals', 'are', 'mixed', 'way', 'front', 'harmony', 'lines', 'are', 'more', 'present', 'tracks', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Walk', 'Away', '.The', 'trailer', 'attached', 'same', 'one', 'previous', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'clean', 'up', 'what', 'worth', 'surprise', 'one', 'came', 'film', 'terrible', 'trailer', 'high', 'point', 'DVD', 'mini-doco', 'are', 'confessions', 'revelations', 'grumbles', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'celebration', 'appreciation', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'die', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'are', 'sadly', 'absent', 'are', 'few', 'dancers', 'production', 'crew', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'widow', 'present', 'help', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'failed', 'also', 'succeeded', 'afterlife', 'video', 'rental', 'late', 'night', 'cable.One', 'other', 'bit', 'attached', 'little', 'photo', 'gallery', 'frame', ""n't"", 'very', 'big', 'most', 'pictures', 'are', 'smaller', ""'d"", 'like', 'still', 'nice', 'see', 'production', 'photos', 'never-before', 'seen', 'shots', 'film.Lastly', 'packaging', 'embarrassing', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'tacky', 'original', 'release', 'sported', 'reprint', 'original', 'movie', 'poster', 'was', ""n't"", 'most', 'eye-catching', 'packaging', 'least', 'was', 'authentic', 'bonus', 'CD', 'exactly', 'same', 'disc', 'was', 'remastered', 'released', 'MCA', 'records', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Not', 'take', 'away', 'Amazon', 'bundle', 'currently', 'being', 'hawked', 'reason', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'addition', 'release', 'already', 'included.All', 'nifty', 'little', 're-release', 'are', 'fan', 'film', 'fan', 'spec-tacky-lar', 'musical', 'numbers', ""'d"", 'totally', 'recommend', 'getting', 'edition']",N/A

Along the way, Sonny befriends former big band musician Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly in his final film performance), who also was guided by Kira some thirty-five years earlier.  Skip to the chase...  Sonny and Kira fall in love,  Kira guides Sonny and Danny to starting a rollerdisco named Xanadu, Sonny and Kira have wrong-side-of-the-track problems, Xanadu opens, Kira performs, happy ever after.Ok, sounds like a weird movie?  you haven't the slightest clue yet.

By the way, the soundtrack album, half Olivia Newton-John, half Electric Light Orchestra,  is a very good album, regardless of the movie's reputation.Will Olivia Newton-John want this movie mentioned to her face ever again?

As I watched Xanadu, I kept trying to find something that could allow me to give it more than one star, but all I kept seeing were scenes and dialogue even more ridiculous than the last; there's even a cartoon scene thrown in here for no good reason.  Xanadu barely even meets my definition of a musical because, despite a good bit of music being interspersed throughout the film, there are only a couple of scenes in which characters actually sing.  Olivia herself is seemingly kept on a leash for the most part, flitting throughout the bulk of the action in a frumpy dress; in spots, she is quickly adorned with some of the worst costumes I have ever seen, and only for about a minute toward the end is the real beauty of Olivia released in all of its glory to the audience.  I am glad that Gene Kelly appeared to being having fun with his role because it lessens the trauma I will forever feel whenever I think about Xanadu being his last major film.  He does get to do a little bit of vintage Gene Kelly dancing, but we also have to see him try out a bunch of ""cool"" new outfits and then, at the end, watch him tool around on roller skates.  When you come right down to it, Xanadu seems to be a film about roller skating and little else.  Olivia's character of Kyra comes to life from a wall mural, skates around town in a mission to inspire Sonny Malone (Michael Beck) and Danny McGuire (Kelly) to open up a club featuring a horrible mix of McGuire's old-time Big Band sound with the worst music that 1980 has to offer.  The extended scene of dueling musical eras inside the nascent club has to be one of the most excruciating scenes in the history of Hollywood.I could give this movie a better rating just because Olivia Newton-John is in it, but my conscience would never allow me to do such a thing.  As much as I hate to say it, Xanadu is a film that should be avoided by all but the most fervent Olivia fans.  To such fans, I will just reiterate the facts that Olivia did not get as much screen time as I was expecting, she was saddled with a terrible character to have to play, the costumes she had to wear - with one all too brief exception - are hideous, and her songs, as nice as they most certainly are for the most part, can in no way make up for this movie's egregiously numerous and all-consuming defects.",1,Beauty cannot save this beast of a movie,1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,2439,"['adore', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'love', 'musicals', 'movie', 'word', 'awful', 'watched', 'Xanadu', 'kept', 'trying', 'find', 'something', 'could', 'allow', 'give', 'more', 'one', 'star', 'kept', 'seeing', 'were', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'last', 'even', 'cartoon', 'scene', 'thrown', 'here', 'good', 'reason', 'Xanadu', 'barely', 'even', 'meets', 'definition', 'musical', 'good', 'bit', 'music', 'being', 'interspersed', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'scenes', 'characters', 'actually', 'sing', 'Olivia', 'seemingly', 'kept', 'leash', 'most', 'part', 'flitting', 'bulk', 'action', 'frumpy', 'dress', 'spots', 'quickly', 'adorned', 'worst', 'costumes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'minute', 'end', 'real', 'beauty', 'Olivia', 'released', 'glory', 'audience', 'am', 'glad', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'appeared', 'being', 'having', 'fun', 'role', 'trauma', 'will', 'forever', 'feel', 'whenever', 'think', 'Xanadu', 'being', 'last', 'major', 'film', 'get', 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'vintage', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'dancing', 'also', 'have', 'see', 'try', 'out', 'bunch', 'cool', 'new', 'outfits', 'then', 'end', 'watch', 'tool', 'roller', 'skates', 'When', 'come', 'right', 'down', 'be', 'film', 'roller', 'skating', 'little', 'else', 'Olivia', 'character', 'Kyra', 'life', 'wall', 'mural', 'town', 'mission', 'inspire', 'Sonny', 'Malone', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'Danny', 'McGuire', 'Kelly', 'open', 'up', 'club', 'featuring', 'horrible', 'mix', 'McGuire', 'old-time', 'Big', 'Band', 'sound', 'worst', 'music', '1980', 'offer', 'extended', 'scene', 'dueling', 'musical', 'eras', 'nascent', 'club', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'excruciating', 'scenes', 'history', 'Hollywood.I', 'could', 'give', 'movie', 'better', 'rating', 'just', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'conscience', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'do', 'thing', 'As', 'much', 'hate', 'say', 'Xanadu', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'most', 'fervent', 'Olivia', 'fans', 'such', 'fans', 'will', 'just', 'reiterate', 'facts', 'Olivia', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'saddled', 'terrible', 'character', 'have', 'play', 'costumes', 'had', 'wear', 'one', 'too', 'brief', 'exception', 'are', 'hideous', 'songs', 'as', 'nice', 'most', 'certainly', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'way', 'make', 'up', 'movie', 'egregiously', 'numerous', 'all-consuming', 'defects']",N/A

My friends and I were dropped off at the theatre and to our surprise the film we intended to see was no longer playing.  After a short discussion we reluctantly creeped in to watch it.  Olivia Newton John in bare knees and roller skates can have quite an effect on a 12 year old boy.  After all these years I still watch the film but with a greater appreciation of its artistry.  It is more of an inspiration than mere entertainment; the kind of story that can pull you inside to dream right along with Michael Beck and dance with Gene Kelly.  The fads were a little wierd because Xanadu bridged the gap of the fading Disco era and approaching age of New Wave, stuck between wide collars and bell-bottoms, and narrow neck-ties and screaming orange hair.  Some of the scenes were so corny that I wanted to sink under my chair and hide (namely the Muses running off at light speed).  But overall this is a delightful classic that no library should be without.The DVD's video transfer is outstanding, but ELO's music tracks are too muffled and bass-ridden.

It's the only movie I've ever seen that made me uncomfortable watching it.To show you how awful I thought this movie was, I had bought the soundtrack to it before the movie came out and loved it, especially the song in which Olivia Newton-John sings a 1940s-style song while the Tubes sing a 1980s rock song. After I saw the movie, not only did I not want to listen to the soundtrack anymore, I wanted to throw it away so it wouldn't bring back any memories of this turkey.The two leads, Ms. Newton-John (who I was a big fan of) and Michael Beck, CANNOT act.

But ""Xanadu"" is a close second, and boy, once the movie gets busy, it'll bloom the screen like the sunlight.  For a good chank of the movie, the special effects consists mainly on neon lights, shiny objects, fluorescent lighting, and those weird shadow effects straight out of Jackson 5's ""Can You Feel It?"" music video; it's practically prone to give seizures.  This is definitely a film of the times, but doesn't stand the test of time.  The story itself is rather zany: an effeminate painter and a washed-up musician had no dreams, so it's up to a muse named Kira who came out of a wall monument to dazzle her way to find a purpose in life by opening a music club.  It's not so much the premise but HOW these events happen. The girl just came to life from wall and rollerskates her way to the painter and kiss him, and then proceed to stalk him at random so he can find his purpose; a lot of strange events happen, like mannequins coming to like, and the main leads don't seem to bat an eye.  Maybe the story isn't important, rather the film is about the experience; yeah, I am using the same excuse most people use onJames Cameron's Eco-Trip.""Xanadu"" is an okay movie, though it is rather unfocused.  It seems like it took the ""Pink Floyd's The Wall"" route, meaning it's less of a musical and more of a feature-length series of music videos.  Besides the number with Gene Kelly and Olivia Newton-John and the unnecessarily lengthy titular end scene, the musical numbers are either people choreographing with no on-screen singing or a character sings but not dancing; one scene is just a montage.  Maybe it's not suppose to be a traditional musical, but nevertheless it can be inconsistent; heck, it can overstay its welcome, as a could of musical numbers went on for way too long, particularly the one sequence where people from the 80s and 50s culture collide.  But for how flawed the musical sequences are set-up, the actual songs are not that bad. They're catchy, if retro and unmemorable, so ELO deserved a bit of praise.  I love the animated musical sequence done by Don Bluth, even if the sequence is just as surreal as the others.

201373,A1EVHYX3X6MJL,6300182320,Designing Mermaid,"[2, 2]","THIS IS THE LAST BEST MUSICAL EVER MADE!!!The reasons why I loved it:-Artwork was excellent, showing a lot of perspective and originality.-Movie was full of beautiful changing colors and lights and great sound effects.-Beautiful enormous wide open spaces for backgrounds, like interior and exteriors of buildings, land and seashore, and sky, and city views.-Very creative scenes. So many different settings. I never saw a movie with this many creative settings, including, old large building interiors, art deco art and buildings and props, many movie set props shown making multiple scenes in one segment where Olivia and Michael roller skate, disco settings, roller skating settings, ocean, seashore, pier, the changing sky, light effects, Mt. Olympus, perspective artwork very 3 dimensional and coming to life, interiors of places of business. Even the some of the cars were creatively painted, and this list can go on and on. So so many creative and innovative scenes.-Great shots, lots of movement.-Beautiful ART DECO art and buildings.-Wonderful fashions-- showing costumes and styles of dressing from the 1920s like the Zoot Suits, through the 1980s with the peasant dresses of the muses to the punk rock dancer costumes, and the big shoulder 1980s dresses.-Coloring was great, including the pastels of the muse dresses and changing colors of Olivia's muse dress as she dances to Magic in the Art Deco building.-Transitions and cuts between scenes, especially between dance scenes was excellent.-I liked the idea of combining the old-fashioned 1940s dancers with the punk style dancers in a dance and music scene, as well as combining the old style song with the 1980s song. Very creative and perfectly combined.-You see all different fashions of clothing on the dancers, from almost all the decades starting with the 1920s. Also, different styles of dancing. And if you look closely, you will even see a group of dancers with dance steps that are very similar to Michael Jackson's Thriller.-Lighting effects were excellent and creative and innovative. Really Discoey, but also showed kaleidescope coloring effects that are seen in  1940's movies!!!!-When Jean Kelly smiled, he lit up the screen. --And wouldn't we all like to be as limber and physically fit as him, at his age--was he in his late 60s or early 70's----I don't know.-Michael Beck was an excellent choice for an actor. I wonder if he was also chosen because of his skating ability, and because he looked like Andy Gibb, who was supposed to have this part, but because of illness, couldn't do it. Beck looked like he was in top physically fit condition.Olivia Newton John was perfect as the muse with her doe-eyed look.I also liked the other muses and would have liked to see a little more dancing done by them. Also, I am trying to figure out who the second muse was. She was the second one that I think came out of the wall and they showed a close-up of her face smiling. She looked a little bit like Debra Winger, but even more beautiful. Anyone know who that actress was??? And what other films was she in??-All the muses were beautiful looking.-All the actors in this film were perfectly chosen for their parts.-And remember, it's a wonderful MUSICAL, so it was not meant to be too intense on the emotional aspects of the storyline. But, it was intense enough. Very tastefully done.-I also loved all of the hair styles, from the 1920s to 1980.-So much creativity went into this movie, and the extravagance of making it probably cost an awful lot.

201378,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300182320,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 8]","I was amazed to discover that the director of this legendary fiasco is the same Robert Greenwald who would go on to make several shrewdly observed documentaries nearly a quarter century later - ""Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"", ""Uncovered: The War on Iraq"", ""Unconstitutional: The War on Our Civil Liberties"". What surprises me even more is how in its sheer, misguided exuberance one can just giggle at the studio mindset that came up with the hilariously awful concept and resulting production. On one hand, ""Xanadu"" is like passing by a car accident...you can't help but stare. On the other, you have to celebrate the fact that it is indeed unique and that we will never see a musical fantasy extravaganza as bizarrely conceived again...hopefully.A mishmash of surreal, forehead-slapping elements that never really congeal, the 1980 movie's fanciful storyline centers on Sonny Malone, a struggling LA commercial artist tired of recreating album covers on canvas for a record company. He is visited by Kira, one of nine muses from ancient Greece, who come to life from a Venice Beach wall mural (set amusingly to ELO's ""I'm Alive""). She inspires Sonny to partner with Danny McGuire, a wealthy eccentric whom she may have inspired when he was a big band clarinetist with his own supper club in New York 35 years earlier. Together, they decide to take the dilapidated, art-deco Pan Pacific Auditorium and turn it into a roller disco club called Xanadu. If that doesn't sound preposterous enough, the cardboard dialogue, overdone Vegas-style sets and cheesy special effects compound the absurdities exponentially.At her virginally pretty peak, the florescent-lighted Olivia Newton-John plays Kira in the same wide-eyed manner she displayed as Sandy in ""Grease"". That she is able to sing, dance and skate with some ease is a pleasant albeit limited surprise. Looking like the lost Bee Gee, a wooden Michael Beck is a blank slate as Sonny, delivering lines as if playing a romantic lead amounts to an alien encounter. As Danny, the 68-year old Gene Kelly is simultaneously celebrated and humiliated as his character is ridiculously drawn in very broad strokes. He provides the film's one unequivocally lovely moment as he shows his still-fluid movements dancing with a uniformed Newton-John on the evocative big-band number, ""Whenever You're Away From Me"". Between her smooth singing and Kelly's soft-shoe dexterity, it's quite magical. Unfortunately, later on, Kelly goes through a series of color-challenged pimp outfits in the silly costume number set to ELO's toe-tapping ""All Over the World"".But Kelly is not the only victim here as silly moments abound - a hilariously overdone 1945-meets-1980 musical fantasy extravaganza, ""Dancin'"", featuring 80's rock band, the Tubes, and outlandish, Solid Gold-type choreography; and there are a couple of gooey pas de deux numbers between Newton-John and Beck - one amid rising palm trees and other props set to ""Suddenly"" and the other set to ELO's ""Don't Walk Away"" with the pair wackily transformed into fish and lovebirds in a Don Bluth cartoon sequence. The most spectacularly inane moments are saved for last - the tacky final production number with a split-screen Kelly skating and Newton-John singing the title tune as she goes through a gamut of irrelevant musical genres and variety revue costumes.The pacing of this movie feels very off and the editing choppy, as the 93-minute movie alternately skitters and drags along coming to a dead halt with Newton-John's overlong number in Tron-like heaven on ""Suspended in Time"". By the time the movie mercifully ends, one feels the same way an audience member felt watching ""Springtime for Hitler"" in ""The Producers"" - utter disbelief yet an unexplainable giddiness about how ludicrously it was all presented. I have to admit some of the music is damnably catchy, for example, ""Magic"". By the way, I saw this movie not on DVD but on the big screen in a pristine print at the fully packed Castro Theater in San Francisco as part of a roller-disco midnight madness program, and the crowd went wild at every absurdity. I have no doubt that this is the optimal way to see this movie.",3,"Forehead-Slapping, Surreally Hilarious Hodgepodge Makes for a Unique Viewing Experience",1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,4188,"['was', 'amazed', 'discover', 'director', 'legendary', 'fiasco', 'same', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'several', 'shrewdly', 'observed', 'documentaries', 'nearly', 'quarter', 'century', 'later', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'War', 'Journalism', 'Uncovered', 'War', 'Iraq', 'Unconstitutional', 'War', 'Civil', 'Liberties', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'how', 'sheer', 'misguided', 'exuberance', 'one', 'can', 'just', 'giggle', 'studio', 'mindset', 'came', 'up', 'hilariously', 'awful', 'concept', 'resulting', 'production', 'one', 'hand', 'Xanadu', 'passing', 'car', 'accident', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'stare', 'other', 'have', 'celebrate', 'fact', 'indeed', 'unique', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'musical', 'fantasy', 'extravaganza', 'bizarrely', 'conceived', 'again', 'hopefully.A', 'mishmash', 'surreal', 'forehead-slapping', 'elements', 'never', 'really', 'congeal', '1980', 'movie', 'fanciful', 'storyline', 'centers', 'Sonny', 'Malone', 'struggling', 'LA', 'commercial', 'artist', 'tired', 'recreating', 'album', 'covers', 'canvas', 'record', 'company', 'visited', 'Kira', 'one', 'nine', 'muses', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'who', 'come', 'life', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'wall', 'mural', 'set', 'amusingly', 'ELO', ""'m"", 'Alive', 'Sonny', 'partner', 'Danny', 'McGuire', 'wealthy', 'eccentric', 'whom', 'may', 'have', 'inspired', 'when', 'was', 'big', 'band', 'clarinetist', 'own', 'supper', 'club', 'New', 'York', '35', 'years', 'earlier', 'Together', 'decide', 'take', 'dilapidated', 'art-deco', 'Pan', 'Pacific', 'Auditorium', 'turn', 'roller', 'disco', 'club', 'called', 'Xanadu', ""n't"", 'sound', 'preposterous', 'enough', 'cardboard', 'dialogue', 'overdone', 'Vegas-style', 'sets', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'compound', 'absurdities', 'exponentially.At', 'virginally', 'pretty', 'peak', 'florescent-lighted', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'Kira', 'same', 'wide-eyed', 'manner', 'displayed', 'Sandy', 'Grease', 'able', 'sing', 'dance', 'skate', 'ease', 'pleasant', 'albeit', 'limited', 'surprise', 'Looking', 'lost', 'Bee', 'Gee', 'wooden', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'blank', 'slate', 'Sonny', 'delivering', 'lines', 'playing', 'romantic', 'lead', 'amounts', 'alien', 'encounter', 'Danny', '68-year', 'old', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'simultaneously', 'celebrated', 'humiliated', 'character', 'ridiculously', 'drawn', 'very', 'broad', 'strokes', 'film', 'one', 'unequivocally', 'lovely', 'moment', 'still-fluid', 'movements', 'dancing', 'uniformed', 'Newton-John', 'evocative', 'big-band', 'number', ""'re"", 'Away', 'Me', 'Between', 'smooth', 'singing', 'Kelly', 'soft-shoe', 'dexterity', 'quite', 'magical', 'Unfortunately', 'later', 'Kelly', 'series', 'color-challenged', 'pimp', 'outfits', 'silly', 'costume', 'number', 'set', 'ELO', 'toe-tapping', 'World', '.But', 'Kelly', 'not', 'only', 'victim', 'here', 'silly', 'moments', 'abound', 'hilariously', 'overdone', '1945-meets-1980', 'musical', 'fantasy', 'extravaganza', 'Dancin', 'featuring', '80', 'rock', 'band', 'Tubes', 'outlandish', 'Solid', 'Gold-type', 'choreography', 'are', 'couple', 'gooey', 'pas', 'deux', 'numbers', 'Newton-John', 'Beck', 'one', 'rising', 'palm', 'trees', 'other', 'props', 'set', 'Suddenly', 'other', 'set', 'ELO', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Walk', 'Away', 'pair', 'wackily', 'transformed', 'fish', 'lovebirds', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'cartoon', 'sequence', 'most', 'spectacularly', 'inane', 'moments', 'are', 'saved', 'last', 'tacky', 'final', 'production', 'number', 'split-screen', 'Kelly', 'skating', 'Newton-John', 'singing', 'title', 'tune', 'gamut', 'irrelevant', 'musical', 'genres', 'variety', 'revue', 'costumes.The', 'pacing', 'movie', 'very', 'off', 'editing', 'choppy', '93-minute', 'movie', 'alternately', 'skitters', 'drags', 'coming', 'dead', 'halt', 'Newton-John', 'overlong', 'number', 'Tron-like', 'heaven', 'Suspended', 'Time', 'time', 'movie', 'mercifully', 'one', 'same', 'way', 'audience', 'member', 'felt', 'watching', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'Producers', 'utter', 'disbelief', 'yet', 'unexplainable', 'giddiness', 'how', 'ludicrously', 'was', 'presented', 'have', 'admit', 'music', 'damnably', 'catchy', 'example', 'Magic', 'way', 'saw', 'movie', 'not', 'DVD', 'big', 'screen', 'pristine', 'print', 'fully', 'packed', 'Castro', 'Theater', 'San', 'Francisco', 'part', 'roller-disco', 'midnight', 'madness', 'program', 'crowd', 'went', 'wild', 'absurdity', 'have', 'doubt', 'optimal', 'way', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

201382,A3OV2QDCLAV9H3,6300182320,El Jimbo,"[2, 3]","I was a fresh high school graduate when I first saw this movie in the theater at it's first run.  I was an idealistic naive and impressionable teenager, (not to mention a huge ELO fan) and I thought it was a pretty good movie, especially the scene where they blended 40's big band and 80's New Wave together so seamlessly.  The hope of a new life after high school helped spur that movie to the top of my favorites for that year.Flash forward 10 years.  OK my life has not turned out to be the dream that I hoped; in fact, in 1990 it pretty much sucked.  Then I saw Xanadu was on TV one evening, and with fond memories of enjoying it, I tuned in.  Halfway though, I was thinking ""How in the HELL did I ever come to like this piece of crap?  Then they showed that scene that blended the two music styles together, and for a brief 5 minute period, I actually enjoyed it again.  Then they had to play the rest of the movie.  Bleech.Another 13 years passed before I found the courage to try it again.  By now my life has improved somewhat, and I thought maybe it was time.  Time it was, time to give my view based on 30 years of this movie.Firstly, Michael Beck had so much promise after ""The Warriors"".  What happened?  I'll tell you what happened.  ""Xanadu"" and ""Megaforce"".  Both those turkeys made him a has-been before he ever had a chance to be a ""will-be"".  Then Gene Kelly, who wasn't a great actor, but could dance to beat the band also had a disappointing performance.  And Olivia was not great either.  Plus the sappy cartoon in the middle is not my idea of great cinema.  I finally came to the conclusion that the fault is not with the actors, because even with sub-par scripts, I've seen some fantastic acting from some people.The problem was sitting in the director's chair.  The guy obviously had no talent, as is evidenced by the fact that he only directed a handful of movies and all are pretty much crappy.

It looks like it was filmed in different sections, by different directors, porducers, and techs.

I was raised Christian so Greek Mith. was not exposed to me.I found the dream sequence very interesting.  It explained why ONJ and Kelly recited the first few lines of the poem. I never understood that until I read that review. I meet ONJ her in Dallas back in 1990.  She was so pretty and very nice.  She was opening up a store called Quala Blue, that later folded. I also purched a music video on VHS called OLIVIA in concert.  Between songs she was talking to the audience. She was talking about a current movie that she made called Xanadu.  The audience went wild. She seemd shocked and exclaimed ""You mean you've seen it??"" Then she started in on the Xanadu song. I was way to young when the movie came out, at the age of 8. The first time that I viewed it I was in awa not understanding it at all!! Then after seeing it over and over agin the movie grew on me, and now I love it!!

201390,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6300182320,Get What We Give,"[3, 4]","Xanadu is a hard film to review, because, as a movie, it is a terrible piece of dreck.  As a music video it works just fine and even succeeds immensely at times.Originally conceived as a disco movie, the producers decided to cash in on the popularity - at the time - of roller skating, so they made the movie - at the last minute - a roller disco film.  Throw in Olivia Newton John and Gene Kelly and you've got:  DISASTER!The plot of the film is so transparently thin that it falls apart several times throughout.  The dialogue is so agonizingly bad that even Gene Kelly (a man not known for his acting but his dancing) must have been embarrassed by it.As the male romantic lead, a little known actor by the name of uh, just a minute I'll think of it.....was cast on the heels of his turn in the highly successful fantasy gang film:  The Warriors.  Michael Beck (the actor's name) can't act, can't sing, and can't dance......  so he was cast in the lead of a musical?  Huh?Newton John plays a Muse (of the old Greek mythology variety) who comes to life off of a wall painting - why we just don't know.  She decides to glom onto Michael Beck's character (an architect who wants to create the most fabulous nightclub ever - Xanadu). And that, folks, is the plot of the movie.  Oh, that, and apparently John's Muse was once the inspiration for Gene Kelly's character back in WWII.  Huh?Anyway, if it weren't for the producers wisely employing Electric Light Orchestra, The Tubes, and Newton-John, then this would have been insufferably bad.  As it is, the movie has some really fantastic moments of musical fun.  There's an interesting mixture of styles when The Tubes performs with a pseudo-swing band from the 1940's.  Then there are Newton-John's songs throughout, which were orchestrated by ELO.  The title song is possibly the most fun because it is where Newton-John met her former husband Matt Lattanzi (he was a dancer in the sequence).  However the sequence employs the whole roller disco thing (not terribly effectively) and feels forced and just looks terrible!However, as I said earlier - Xanadu works as an extended music video - something that was not in true existence at the time - it would happen about a year later on MTV.Xanadu was made in the very late 1970's and released in 1980 and just happened to hit theatrers when disco was becoming reviled and New Wave was the latest sensation.  Also by 1980 roller disco was VERY passe.  Xanadu laid a big old egg (although I've read that it did fairly well at the box office on Newton-John's Grease fame and general popularity alone).Get the DVD and select the song chapters and you'll have a great time watching this.

Without Olivia Newton John and ELO's incredible soundtrack, Xanadu would've just been a real clunker.  The costumes, special effects and transitions are affectionately dated - I say affectionate because you can see how cool they were perceived as being at the time.  Roller Skates!  Pattern wipes!  I hadn't seen the movie for 3 decades and heck, it's like watching a movie-of-the-week now, but better.Michael Beck is incredibly stiff in this, and his quote ""The Warriors opened doors for me that Xanadu then closed"" was sadly true.  ONJ has barely any lines but radiates with her incredible girl-next-door appeal in this very simple story.  We can only lay the blame on the creative team - which apparently went to production with an incomplete script.  Well, somehow they made it work.  Gene Kelly is amazing in this and lightfooted and charming as ever.Probably the best part of this DVD edition is the bonus behind-the-scenes documentary.  While ONJ and Michael Beck avoided or weren't approached for an interview (what a shame) - the director, producer, choreographer and dancers give a really good account of what really happened in making the movie.  Some great anecdotes here.The musical numbers are great - and that's what matters.  The soul and warmth of the film transcend its 80s production values and the cheesy effects.

With the help of a clarinet-playing charmer named Danny McGuire(The late Gene Kelly, Singing in the Rain.), Xanadu became the talk of Southern California. The music by Newton-John and ELO was excellent and the roller-dancing and choreography by Kenny Ortega(Michael Jackson's This Is It, Newsies)was the best.

It's not a bad film at all (try The Apple, now that's bad), I'd rate this a five but the ""Magical Music Edition"" DVD is so much less than it could have been.  After all these years, true fans were expecting a bit more than this edition offers.Highly suspicious is the fact that the ""Going Back To Xanadu"" documentary, while including many film clips, uses NONE of the music from the film. Instead there is a cheesy score of music that sounds like it was created to sound early 80s, which makes the clips come off as indeed something from a bad film instead of how much fun Xanadu really was.  Was it that Universal couldn't manage to legally use the music at this time in the documentary? I know back then Universal was tied in with MCA Records, so now who knows what happened.What was left out that should have been included was a documentary aired  on TV called MAKING XANADU (""An ONJ Production"") that included interviews by the musical talent involved, as well as a great alternate take on the scene for the song ""Suspended In Time.""The so-called complete soundtrack CD included in this edition is just the regular 10 track soundtrack that was on vinyl and released on CD before, with the basic short versions. Fans were expecting at least the inclusion of the 7"" b-sides of songs from the film but not on the soundtrack release before... songs like ELO's ""Drum Dreams,"" Olivia's ""You Made Me Love You"" and ""Fool Country"" as well as some nice score music like the dancing waitress music.  There were also early versions of songs like ""I'm Alive"" and ""All Over The World"" that could have been included somehow.  Let's hope that there will someday be a special CD release with the extra tracks before the CD format fades away -- if a special anniversary edition of the soundtrack for The Sound Of Music can be released with alternate takes and fuller versions, why not one for Xanadu?  There are indeed enough people out there that would buy it and it would be a great seller.As I said, I love Xanadu. I saw it three times the first week it was released in theatres (as the director said, ""They loved it in St. Louis!"" which is where I lived at the time). The film always makes me smile and brings back fond memories of that time in my life. As a collector of things Xanadu, I of course bought this DVD edition and enjoyed some of the new features.

The music is why this film has endured and is one of its few redeeming values, songs written for Olivia Newton-John by John Farrar and for the film by ELO's Jeff Lynne. This song writing double threat produced some enduring classics which serve as a time-stamp of this era as we transitioned over from the disco 70's into the new music of the 80's.I thought the HD video quality of this movie to be excellent and certainly an improvement over the DVD which I own. I saw quite a bit of detail I had never noticed before, make-up lines, complexions, hair, etc. The music was reproduced nicely with a stereo soundtrack which I believe was how it premiered although I could be wrong.

This is an absolutely wonderful film, an uplifting musical that exhilarates with its verve and joy.  Olivia  Newton-John is exquisite being both winsome and exotic/erotic as the greek  muse.  This was made during Newton-John's  multiple personality phase of  her career where one minute she was Sandra Dee from Muskogee, the next a  Nordic Dominatrix from Hell.  She manages to infuse both facets  intriguingly here with her supernatural greek muse character being both  sweet yet vaguely intimidating.  As an earlier post stated, the script is  very clever in it's allusions to greek mythology.  The male lead is stiff  but what can one do when Olivia is on the screen except stand there and be  quiet.  Gene Kelly is wonderful as well and I believe this was his final  film appearence; an excellent final bow.  The musical numbers and songs are  magnificent-especially the dancing duet between Kelly and Newton-John, the  big band/rock combo and the show stopping conclusion.  What I think some  viewers do not seem to comprehend is that this film is both a tribute and a  reincarnation of the wonderful hollywood musicals of the thirties-sixties  period. The animated sequence is an obvious homage/steal from ANCHORS AWAY  and An AMERICAN IN PARIS. Unfortunatley, Xanadu was made in the eighties  when the culture was already in freefall. So, of course, no one knew or  knows what to make of it. For those who think this is a bad film--HEY!  there's a new Bruce Willis movie on TV! Go watch it.  For the rest, we can  take pleasure in a charming musical fantasy that they just don't make  anymore.  Xanadu was the last.

They end up falling in love and she makes his dreams come true by helping him open up a dance club. She also has an acquaintance from way back when pitch in. Unfortunately, there's a bit of a culture clash between the lovers, since muses aren't supposed to fall in love, but it all works out in the end.Admittedly, this is a pretty outlandish premise. Silly, even. But it's certainly a workable idea, and could have made for a great screwball comedy. But instead what we get out of it is XANADU, a really bad script that somehow got Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly attached to it. This script is so bad that not even director Robert Greenwald, editor Dennis Virkler, and DP Victor Kemper, guys who've done good work elsewhere, can fix it. In fact, these poor guys are totally hamstrung by the script's lameness. Even Kenny Ortega, the choreographer behind DIRTY DANCING, ends up turning in bad work (ONJ's dance moves near the end are a mess). And Don Bluth's animation is woefully out of place here. What the heck happened?Now, ONJ, then hot off GREASE, has acting talent. She can do light comedy. We see none of that skill in this film. The playful sexiness this lovely lady had in GREASE is replaced here with being handcuffed to bad plotting (the story goes nowhere, and the characters are as flat as it gets) and even worse dialogue (&quot;Nobody's ever gotten out of here in the whole history of...the whole history!&quot;). Even ONJ's costumes are ludicrous and silly, she only looks glamourous in this film when she's dressed in the army gear for her number with Gene Kelly. And poor Kelly, like ONJ, tries gamely to enliven the proceedings, but not even his charm can overcome such a rotten script. And why did they pick a leading man who can't sing, dance, or act? Michael Beck has all the charisma and screen presence of concrete. Also, Wilfred Hyde-White, as Zeus, sounds like he's half-asleep when he's delivering his lines. Speaking of music, almost all of the songs are used as background pieces. Rarely do the characters themselves sing. Doesn't this defeat the purpose of a musical? And also, the musical numbers are far too gaudy and over-the-top; the mixing of time-periods doesn't work. It also doesn't help that there are only two good songs in this film, &quot;Suddenly&quot; and &quot;All Over The World.&quot; Everything else is either headache-inducing are needlessly sugary.This movie gets two stars only because of Gene Kelly and ONJ.

Its plot makes no sense (a muse descends from heaven to help painter Michael Beck create the ultimate roller disco palace); its attempt to appeal both to an older crowd (with Gene Kelly in the WWII sequences) and a younger crowd (with the disco music, already out of fashion when the movie was released) was doomed to please neither constituency; and its star, Olivia Newton-John, seems unsure what she's supposed to be doing.Foolish mortals: Whatever its failing this movie is worth it just for its fashions and makeup (vintage 1980) and its two great opening and closing numbers, which showcase the musical directors' lovely (if silly) eye for style. In the first, set to ELO's ""I'm Alive,"" a lovely group of muses (including the enchantingly beautiful ONJ) emerge from a mural and start dancing exuberantly in truly beautiful dancing outfits that look like a cross between Seventies peasant dresses and togas: they all become transformed into rainbow-colored raybeams and zoom up to the skies, and then Newton-John herself descends from heaven, rollerskating and glowing orange. (It sounds ridiculous, but it's visually stunning.)The bizarrely campy final number, the amazing title song, features hundreds of  chanting roller dancers first led by Kelly (in his Seventies!) and then by Livvy herself in a whirling array of different outfits that must be seen to be believed. First she's in a kind of spangly combination of a maillot and a sleeveless jumpsuit, dancing all over the place and watching circus performers, and then her hair is piled high on her head and she's in what looks to be a polka-dot Forties cigarette girl costume actually leading the other muses (gifted trained dancers all) in a  tapdance number even though she can *barely* do the most simple tap steps herself, and then she's in this foxy tigerstriped ""glam rock"" miniskirt prowling around and being sensual, and then she's doing a country number in a white suede cowgirl thingy with ultra-long fringe, and then (gasp, gasp!) she disappears for a moment and all the other muses come on wearing white dancing gowns with what appear to be white plastic triangles on their heads, and then finally Olivia herself emerges from behind them wearing an outfit that almost completely defies description--she looks like like a cross between Josephine Baker and a Cylon warrior: appropriately, everyone else onscreen wildly applauds this latest costume change. And THEN--zap!--neon lightning transforms Olivia and the muses back into their beautiful peasant togas from the first number, and then they all are transfigured and sent back up to heaven.

The acting may have been a little cheezy, but it wasn't all that great in Moulin Rouge! either. People need to understand that this is a MUSICAL and musicals aren't necessarily known for their great acting performances. They are noted for their brilliant choreography, songs, and stage settings, which I felt both ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Xanadu"" contained. Moreover, the story in ""Xanadu"" wasn't all that incoherent and reminded me a lot of ""Field of Dreams"" when Kevin Costner is inspired by a voice from an invisible muse to build a baseball field. So, while some of the criticism of this film is justified, I feel much of it is not and it took way more of a beating than it should have.

201420,A3D6DPWQW509R9,6300182320,John Seger,"[0, 0]","Ok, I want to clear up some myths as I begin this review.When this film was originally released in 1980, it was beaten up terribly by film critics, and it didn't live up to expectations at the box office. Because of this, urban legends have grown surrounding this film's failure, and while it wasn't a huge hit, it also wasn't the huge financial bomb it is made out to be: ""Xanadu"" was made for around $12 million dollars. It's U.S. box office gross was just under $24 million. So, in fact, while it did fall short of expectations, it actually did make a bit of money in it's initial run. Add foreign box office, and you have another $30 million dollars it grossed. And if you equal inflation from 1980 to 2007, it's U.S. gross would have been near $85 million now, so it did generate tickets. The budget was just too big to justify it as a hit. The soundtrack, on the other hand, was a smash hit, selling over 4 million copies, and spinning off no less than 5 top 20 singles, including ONJ's ""Magic,"" which spent 4 weeks at #1. Eventually, many more people saw the film on HBO and Video cassette. In fact, the Beta/VHS release of the movie was a smash hit. This film now has a large devoted following. SO much so, in fact, that there is now a hit broadway musical version paying homage and satire to this camp classic.In all honesty, the film itself is a strange trip. If you didn't grow up around 1980, you most likely won't ""get it."" And that's ok. Despite the bad writing, and badly realized plot, the musical numbers hold the movie together, along with the gorgeous Olivia Newton-John and legendary Gene Kelley doing their best jobs, considering the script they had to work with. And Michael Beck? Stunningly flat here. But the film strangely works. It's campy, over the tip top at times, and gloriously tacky. The music is wonderful, and the musical numbers come right after another. SO, after 27 years, ""Xanadu"" has in fact lasted. It has sold millions of video cassettes, and more millions more on DVD.Certainly Universal isn't crying about the profits this film eventually netted for the Studio. ""Xanadu"" is a guilty pleasure, worthy of repeated viewings. And certainly not the huge financial bomb people like to say it was.",5,A bomb?

Something of an achievement in itself!)Not just bad, but truly, TRULY abyssmal on ALL levels!No one can act, ...no one can sing, no one can dance, (yes, this IS a musical!)...and the leads can barely even skate!The poor extras all work their collective butts off but to little avail. Even they are trapped in this gigantic turkey.The storyline is so thin as to be almost non-existent, and even what little there is of it is constantly interrupted with hokey damn ""production numbers"" that have absolutely no relevance whatsoever. They just don't know what the hell they are doing! The 80's ""modern"" stuff is so cringe-worthy as to have you hiding under the couch. (Surely ""Glam-Rock"" couldn't have been THAT bad?)I'll give her one thing though, Olivia Neutron-Bomb proves that you do not need any talent at all to get into a movie.It's a musical?She can't sing! There's dancing?She can't dance, ....notice how she just runs open-armed through the dance scenes as all the poor extras dance furiously?It's a movie about skating? She ""skates"" (ha!)like she has had just a quick three-minute lesson, with her legs spread so far apart as to look like a drunken old cow facing milking!(Of course her stand-in skates beautifully! Trouble is you can tell it's NOT Olivia a mile off, ..even though the poor double is always shot in semi-darkness.)Olivia couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag! Unfortunately they could not dub her acting.....more's the damn pity, but she's not alone in the lack of that supposedly necessary talent here by any means.!And what the hell is it with her ""Holly Hobbie"" inspired folksy damn wardrobe?More frills than Zsa Zsa's bedroom curtains,and all in sprigged chiffon? And not to forget those ubiquitous damned incongruous LEG-WARMERS with EVERYTHING!Good grief! Just how really tragic were the 80's???Her leading Poonce-Charming is about as charismatic as last weeks cold lasagne, .....blessed with a nose that would be perfect should his role be ""Pinocchio"".(Unfortunately it isn't!)How much money they had to give Gene Kelly to induce him into this crap remains a secret, but it must have been gazillions!He wanders about in some sort of a soporific daze reminiscing about the ""old days"", ...as well he might! Or perhaps he's just overdosed on Geritol?He appears to be in black-&-white, when the movie is in colour.Surely he must have spent some of his loot trying to ensure all copies of this movie were transferred to highly inflammable celluloid stock?He actually died shortly after making this bomb. Possibly of shame one might suggest?Just when you think it cannot possibly get any worse, it lapses into some sort of extended Disneyesque animation with the two leads morphing into cartoon birds, fish (I kid you not!), and fairies flitting through Bambi-backgrounds. (No, I am NOT making this up!)Then there's a VERY long sequence with Olivia just singing to camera, (or trying to) where I'm sorry but I could not resist the Fast Forward Button a moment longer!But it doesn't get any better after that.Try to withold your hysteria at the sheer appalling ""badness"" of the execrable ""talking to the Gods"" sequence!Not even ""camp"", ....just pathetically inept.The ""ending"" which follows is simply a mish-mash of more incongruent dance styles in ridiculously varied themed costumes, all filmed with what passed for special effects back then, and nothing is resolved as far as plot goes.

201439,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,6300182320,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[1, 4]","Despite the fact that there are far more egregious examples of torture on celluloid (just check out anything with Pauley Shore or Fran Drescher), &quot;Xanadu&quot; has forever been condemned as one of the worst films ever made. The truth is that &quot;Xanadu&quot; is a fair, lightweight movie that is a product of its time; no more, no less.There's a lot to like here. The music, of course (including several hits for Olivia Newton-John), is the best point in the film's favor. The film is very innocent and upbeat, unlike what we see from Hollywood today. Kira fading in and out, popping up from nowhere, and the strange, uplifting effect the Muse has on Sonny and Danny are all very well done. I even liked the record company executive (James Sloyan), and the interesting scene where he explains to Sonny how he gave up art and learned to conform. And we certainly cannot underestimate the charm and style Gene Kelly brings to the picture whenever his character is in the spotlight.The worst thing about &quot;Xanadu&quot; has nothing to do with the music, the spotty acting of Newton-John and Michael Beck, or even the ludicrous idea that roller disco was somehow cool. Hands down, the worst thing about this movie is the shoddy directing from Robert Greenwald.Greenwald is entirely out of his element with the dance sequences, starting right off the bat with the Muses coming to life from the painting. While the dance number drags on, the shots become increasingly more and more like pan and scan video, zoomed in on only part of the action, letting us see only a portion of the dancers. Another shockingly inept sequence is Newton-John's song after Sonny is kicked out of Olympus. The camera slowly zooms in on Kira for something like two minutes, while the character just stands there singing. What was required here was to have the character walking through the bizzare animated environment of Mount Olympus, or just to cut the number altogether, neither of which Greenwald opted for.One of the few dance numbers worth taking the time to sit through is the Gene Kelly number as he reminisces about his long lost love. The only competently directed musical number, this one could have been taken directly from a top-notch musical film of the late fifties. Obviously Kelly must have had (or taken) some control over this sequence to ensure it not be an embarrassment. The number works, no thanks to Greenwald (at least not if we take the rest of his efforts on the project into account).Other than the Kelly number, there is a very interesting sequence when Danny and Sonny visit the future &quot;Xanadu&quot;. Danny sees a swinging big band, and Sonny sees a rock group. Although the sequence takes an eternity to get there, the two styles (and sets) suddenly start to merge into one song and one style, and winds up being completely amazing.And that's just what's so frustrating about the film; it can be so fun and infectious, and then turn on a dime and be so torpid and vapid. The ideas are all really good, but many wind up being wasted by the ineffective Greenwald. Thanks to (or because of) Greenwald, &quot;Xanadu&quot; is to musicals what &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; was to &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies.There is some real magic on display in &quot;Xanadu&quot;, but you have to really strain your eyes (and patience) to see most of it. I'd say that fans of Kelly need to screen this one just to see how good the man still looks late in his career. Newton-John fans may just wanna stick with listening to a CD of the soundtrack.",3,Musical Mish-Mosh...

The music of this period helped shape a lot of my listening pleasures, and Xanadu was a film with a lot of great music.  I wore that album out, playing it constantly.  &quot;The Fall&quot; is a truly powerful song about love.  &quot;Fool Country&quot; (available only on the flip side of 45's) and &quot;Dancin' Round and Round&quot; were great fusions of differing musical styles.  &quot;Suddenly&quot; reminds me of some of my first crushes - a song I wish I was dueting with certain girls.  Then there are the other big hits as well: &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;I'm Alive&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;All Over The World&quot;.  A feast of sound.One cannot review the film without taking the music into play.  Yes, the acting was average at best, the dialogue sometimes hokey.  Guess what?

201445,A3VSIDO2HTQ2P0,6300182320,"M. Elizabeth Pietrzak ""driftingcloud""","[3, 4]","Often labeled the poster child for some of the worst cinema, Xanadu, starring Oliva Newton John and Gene Kelley, doesn't survive an overzealous scrutiny. Yes, the plot is about as solid as the frayed edges of torn out paper pages from a spiral-bound notebook. Yes, some of the principal photography suffers from poor lighting, cardboard scenery, and general deterioration on certain scenes (making them look as grainy as some of the movies from the 40s to which this film likes to nod throughout.) But if we look beyond those items, if we can consider this film simply on its own merits rather than comparing it to any grand cinema standard, we have a musical film filled with some simply outstanding dance scenes, excellent music, bits of poignant animation, and more.As a musical entree, which is really the focus of this film, the filmmakers provide the audience with entertainment with a capital E. The musical numbers are the core of the film, and as such, the weak plot interspersed between numbers can be hardly noticeable. Compare this piece to most popular Broadway musicals, such as The Music Man, A Chorus Line, or maybe Cats, and Xanadu delivers 100%, albeit in a somewhat dated fashion. Much of the presentation is provided via theatrical conventions, wide shots and dance routines that would look terrific on stage, in front of a live audience. The choreographed numbers with larger casts of dancers and skaters appear almost as if they were filmed with one camera, and one sequence flows seamlessly into a new camera POV. Again, remnants of a staged vison more than a filmed vision. I wonder if anyone has considered turning Xanadu into a Broadway musical? There is where the true light of Xanadu could shine best and brightest.Most of the dancing is simply an incredible costumed movement feast for the eyes, especially the 30s/40s/50s mix-mash in ""Dancin'"" with a wild blend of zoot suits, big band, and ballsy plaids. Gene Kelly performs at the top of his form in a duet with Olivia Newton-John, and the finale ""Xanadu"" with roller-skating dancing and stunts provide some of the most developed and wonderfully choreographed moments on screen. And dare we mention Muse #1, played by Sandahl Bergman, as a stand out dancer? If you are a true Sandahl Bergman fan (best known for her role, Valeria, in Conan the Barbarian), then you will definitely want to add Xanadu to your collection. She is one of the more precise and fluid dancers in the film, and it is a shame she only gets to perform in two numbers, ""I'm Alive"" and ""Xanadu.""The music is provided by Olivia Newton-John singing and John Farrar writing with 5 songs (one duet with Cliff Richard, one with Gene Kelly, and one big-band/rock-band mix with The Tubes) and another 5 songs provided by the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). Hearken back to the years 1979 and 1980, when absolutely everything that came out of Jeff Lynne and ELO was timeless, beautiful, and catchy. Their Discovery album of 1979 was without a single weak song and soared to the top of the charts with several singles. ELO was truly at their best during this era, and if your vinyl Xanadu soundtrack album is getting a bit worn thin, then this DVD is a worthy investment for a top notch mix of the audio. The only thing erroneously missing, musically-speaking, from the film is that the performance never includes ELO on screen. Such a shame. They would have easily fit in to the finale and could have boosted the impact of the music element of the film.Don Bluth provides a fantastic animation sequence for ""Don't Walk Away"", a flawlessly executed and conceived piece depicting our two lovers, Kira (Newton-John) and Sonny (Micheal Beck.) And if you look closely, one of the animated animals representing Kira is at one point wearing leg warmers, a nod to the 1980s.Remember that when this film came to the screen, MTV didn't exist and music videos were in their infancy. All of the songs in this film can individually be considered music videos, and as such, most of them succeed on their own. Many of the optical effects throughout the film were fantastic for the time. In fact, this reviewer would like to see the show condensed into just the musical numbers. You can skip through the show, just watching the songs, and you essentially get the overall arc of the story as well as, or better than, the film as a whole. Now why didn't they add a selection to do just the songs, like Hedwig and The Angry Inch does?While watching the songs, you MUST view the subtitles at least once. I think the true spirit of the show is adequately reflected in the subtitle descriptions of the sound effects. If you can't laugh at the show while doing so, you probably shouldn't be watching this flick.I only wish the costume designer had chosen a different costume for Micheal Beck during ""The Fall."" Do we really want to see him skating down Venice Beach in flame orange short shorts and a Hawaiian shirt? This reviewer would like to forget that she ever wore shorts like that...=)",3,"ONJ, ELO, Dancing, Wild Costumes and Leg Warmers",1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,5014,"['Often', 'labeled', 'poster',

Disco was in it's death throes, but don't tell that to the makers of this film. Very kitchy, but fun at the same time. Features some nice songs of the era by Olivia and ELO. Not exactly the best vehicle for Gene, but it was nice seeing him appear never the less. Now, fastforward to 2011 and XANADU is a Broadway production. Ok, it pokes fun at the film, but why not.

To truly enjoy this movie, you have to be educated on black and white musicals, poetry, and greek mythology.First of all I will explain the origins of the word ""Xanadu"".In 1797 there was a poet named Samuel Coleridge who lived by himself. He was asleep, after taking a dose of Opium and washing it down with alcohol. In his dreams appeared a beautiful woman, (he later called her a muse) reciting a beautiful poem. Alas, a knock at the door from a friend broke him out of his dream, and he rushed to his table to write down what he could remember. The result was a poem titled ""Kubla Khan""In the poem, there is a heavenly place called XANADU, where there is eternal love and happiness. The word has sense been adopted to mean ""heaven"".The movie is based on this poem. When Kira appears to a bewildered Gene Kelly, and tells him to call his new club XANADU, and together they recite the first lines of the poem KUBLA KHAN.Now the reason Gene Kelly is in this film is because Kira has appeared in his life in the 1940's. She returns to help him out again, to inspire his dying ambitions, by inspiring him to open another music club. However he will need someone young and hip to help him out. So Kira also inspires Sonny Malone to quit his bland painting job and use his talents towards his dream. Therefore Kira brings the 2 men together.Xanadu is a remake of a film titled ""Down To Earth"" starring Rita Hayworth. Rita also appears as a muse to inspire people to follow their dreams.Gene kelly's character ""Danny McGuire"" was actually the name of Gene's character in the 1944 film ""Covergirl"".If you are well read on Greek Mythology, you will know there are muses who represent the arts. They are called for in times of need to help inspire an artist's dying ambitions. Therefore the opening scene where the muses are coming out of the wall serves as a window between their world and ours.Another good tidbit to know about the film, Andy Gibb was suppose to be the male star, not Michael Beck. Andy apparently was in ill health at the time and couldn't be insured by the company.Xanadu was a film I saw as a 9 year old child. I had been severely injured and could not walk. I was hopeless and depressed. Then one night, Xanadu made its cable debut. I was carried into the living room to watch it (I couldn't walk). I had never seen Olivia Newton-John before, and I was mesmerized by the most incredible woman I had ever seen, dancing and singing through this magical fairy tale. My life had been hum drum up to that point, and the magic, glitz, animation, and music from this film made me want to get up. I was so anxious to walk and rollerskate (LOL) that I was up in no time walking around. I will forever love this movie and how a ""muse"" called Olivia inspired me to live again.",5,Let Me Give You Kiddies a Little History Lesson,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,2895,"['people', 'say', 'plot', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'need', 'read', 'review', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'have', 'be', 'educated', 'black', 'white', 'musicals', 'poetry', 'greek', 'mythology.First', 'will', 'explain', 'origins', 'word', 'Xanadu', '.In', '1797', 'was', 'poet', 'named', 'Samuel', 'Coleridge', 'who', 'lived', 'was', 'asleep', 'taking', 'dose', 'Opium', 'washing', 'down', 'alcohol', 'dreams', 'appeared', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'later', 'called', 'muse', 'reciting', 'beautiful', 'poem', 'Alas', 'knock', 'door', 'friend', 'broke', 'dream', 'rushed', 'table', 'write', 'down', 'what', 'could', 'remember', 'result', 'was', 'poem', 'titled', 'Kubla', 'Khan', 'poem', 'heavenly', 'place', 'called', 'XANADU', 'where', 'eternal', 'love', 'happiness', 'word', 'sense', 'been', 'adopted', 'mean', 'heaven', '.The', 'movie', 'based', 'poem', 'When', 'Kira', 'bewildered', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'call', 'new', 'club', 'XANADU', 'together', 'recite', 'first', 'lines', 'poem', 'KUBLA', 'KHAN.Now', 'reason', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'film', 'Kira', 'appeared', 'life', '1940', 'help', 'out', 'again', 'inspire', 'dying', 'ambitions', 'inspiring', 'open', 'music', 'club', 'However', 'will', 'need', 'someone', 'young', 'hip', 'help', 'out', 'So', 'Kira', 'also', 'Sonny', 'Malone', 'quit', 'bland', 'painting', 'job', 'use', 'talents', 'dream', 'Therefore', 'Kira', '2', 'men', 'together.Xanadu', 'remake', 'film', 'titled', 'Down', 'Earth', 'starring', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Rita', 'also', 'muse', 'inspire', 'people', 'follow', 'dreams.Gene', 'kelly', 'character', 'Danny', 'McGuire', 'was', 'actually', 'name', 'Gene', 'character', '1944', 'film', 'Covergirl', '.If', 'are', 'well', 'read', 'Greek', 'Mythology', 'will', 'know', 'are', 'muses', 'who', 'represent', 'arts', 'are', 'called', 'times', 'need', 'help', 'inspire', 'artist', 'dying', 'ambitions', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'muses', 'are', 'coming', 'wall', 'window', 'world', 'ours.Another', 'good', 'tidbit', 'know', 'film', 'Andy', 'Gibb', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'male', 'star', 'not', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'Andy', 'apparently', 'was', 'ill', 'health', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'insured', 'company.Xanadu', 'was', 'film', 'saw', '9', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'had', 'been', 'severely', 'injured', 'could', 'not', 'walk', 'was', 'hopeless', 'depressed', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'Xanadu', 'made', 'cable', 'debut', 'was', 'carried', 'living', 'room', 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'walk', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'most', 'incredible', 'woman', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'dancing', 'singing', 'magical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'My', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'hum', 'up', 'point', 'magic', 'glitz', 'animation', 'music', 'film', 'made', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'anxious', 'walk', 'rollerskate', 'LOL', 'was', 'up', 'time', 'walking', 'around', 'will', 'forever', 'love', 'movie', 'how', 'muse', 'called', 'Olivia', 'inspired', 'live', 'again']",N/A

I think for the most part it is a great film.Sonny McGuire (Michael Beck) wants to be a serious artist but he cannot support himself doing this.  So Sonny works for a record company making billboard sized copies of record album covers.  This pays the bill but he is not allowed any creativity in his work.As the film opens, Sonny is at his home studio trying to create something.  He sketches a bust, tears it up and throws it out the window.  The pieces float on the wind and land at a wall mural of nine women dancing.  One by one the pictures come to life (I'm Alive). They dance, etc. and return to Olympus (?) except one.Sonny is walking in the park when the one remaining muse, Kira (Olivia Newton-John) bumps into Sonny, kisses him and skates away.  At work, Sonny is copying a cover when he notices that one of the models is the girl that bumped into him.  He wants to find out who she is but no one knows.  He decides to go back to the beach to look for her and discovers the setting of the album.  He goes in and magically Kira appears (Magic) and then disappears.Sonny is hanging his latest masterpiece when he runs into Danny Maguire (Gene Kelly).  Back at Danny's they are listening to one of his big band recordings from WWII when he see a picture of Kira in the album.  Danny's desire is to open another club and tells Sonny to look for someplace.  Danny remembers his time with Kira (Whenever You're Away From Me - Kelly shows not only that he still can tap but he is still one of the best!)Sonny goes back to work when Kira appears.  He takes her to the fantasy soundstage and they skate through a fantasy sequence (Suddenly).  Sonny's boss catches them and they escape.  They wind up in front of the auditorium.Sonny takes Danny to the auditorium.  At first Danny is not sure but once inside, he sees the potential.  Of course he sees a swing club but Sonny sees it as a dance club (Dancin'). They decide to become partners.  Sonny and Kira celebrate into an animated sequence (Don't Walk Away).They are getting ready for the opening but Danny needs up to date threads (All Over the World).  Xanadu is ready to open and Kira's assignment is done.  But she is not ready to leave but must.  Sonny will not let this be and searches for Kira (The Fall).  He finds the mural and in a moment of desperation skates towards it.  He breaks through the barrier and finds Kira but her parents are none too happy.  Kira makes a final plea (Suspended in Time).Xanadu opens with a musical number that Busby Berkley would approve of.  And Kira makes an appearance and disappearance.  Sonny is desolate until he sees a waitress who looks just like Kira.This is an homage of the great MGM musicals with today's music (well 1980 music).  If you look at it from this perspective, then it works brilliantly.  Every technical aspect is perfect.The best thing about this film is Gene Kelly.  He proved at almost 70 he could hang with the kids - and show them a thing or two.  This was a performance that should have garnered him one more Oscar nomination.Olivia Newton-John is one of those performers that has a great and warm personality.  What she might lack in acting experience she makes up in spades with charm and she can put over a song!The only weak point is Michael Beck who never has been a capable actor but he delivers his lines and gets out of the way.The songs have almost all become hits and standards.  These bring the film together.If you love the old MGM musicals and the pop hits of Olivia Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra, you will love this.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,Gene Kelly's Final Performance steals the Show!!,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,3703,"['must', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'Xanadu', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'am', 'minority', 'film', 'think', 'most', 'part', 'great', 'film.Sonny', 'McGuire', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'be', 'serious', 'artist', 'can', 'not', 'support', 'doing', 'So', 'Sonny', 'works', 'record', 'company', 'making', 'billboard', 'sized', 'copies', 'record', 'album', 'bill', 'not', 'allowed', 'creativity', 'work.As', 'film', 'Sonny', 'home', 'studio', 'trying', 'create', 'something', 'bust', 'tears', 'up', 'out', 'window', 'pieces', 'float', 'wind', 'land', 'wall', 'mural', 'nine', 'women', 'dancing', 'One', 'one', 'pictures', 'come', 'life', ""'m"", 'Alive', 'dance', 'etc', 'return', 'Olympus', 'one.Sonny', 'walking', 'park', 'when', 'one', 'remaining', 'muse', 'Kira', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'Sonny', 'away', 'work', 'Sonny', 'copying', 'cover', 'when', 'one', 'models', 'girl', 'bumped', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'one', 'go', 'back', 'beach', 'look', 'setting', 'album', 'magically', 'Kira', 'Magic', 'then', 'disappears.Sonny', 'hanging', 'latest', 'masterpiece', 'when', 'Danny', 'Maguire', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Back', 'Danny', 'are', 'listening', 'one', 'big', 'band', 'recordings', 'WWII', 'when', 'see', 'picture', 'Kira', 'album', 'Danny', 'desire', 'open', 'club', 'tells', 'Sonny', 'look', 'someplace', 'Danny', 'time', 'Kira', 'Whenever', ""'re"", 'Away', 'Me', 'Kelly', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'can', 'tap', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'Sonny', 'back', 'work', 'when', 'Kira', 'fantasy', 'soundstage', 'skate', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'Suddenly', 'Sonny', 'boss', 'escape', 'wind', 'up', 'front', 'auditorium.Sonny', 'Danny', 'auditorium', 'first', 'Danny', 'not', 'sure', 'once', 'inside', 'potential', 'course', 'swing', 'club', 'Sonny', 'dance', 'club', 'Dancin', 'decide', 'become', 'partners', 'Sonny', 'Kira', 'celebrate', 'animated', 'sequence', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Walk', 'Away', '.They', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'opening', 'Danny', 'up', 'date', 'threads', 'World', 'Xanadu', 'ready', 'open', 'Kira', 'assignment', 'done', 'not', 'ready', 'leave', 'must', 'Sonny', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'searches', 'Kira', 'Fall', 'mural', 'moment', 'desperation', 'skates', 'barrier', 'Kira', 'parents', 'are', 'none', 'too', 'happy', 'Kira', 'final', 'plea', 'Suspended', 'Time', '.Xanadu', 'musical', 'number', 'Busby', 'Berkley', 'would', 'approve', 'Kira', 'appearance', 'disappearance', 'Sonny', 'desolate', 'waitress', 'who', 'just', 'Kira.This', 'homage', 'great', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'today', 'music', 'well', '1980', 'music', 'look', 'perspective', 'then', 'brilliantly', 'Every', 'technical', 'aspect', 'perfect.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'proved', 'almost', '70', 'could', 'hang', 'kids', 'show', 'thing', 'two', 'was', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'garnered', 'one', 'more', 'Oscar', 'nomination.Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'one', 'performers', 'great', 'warm', 'personality', 'What', 'might', 'lack', 'acting', 'experience', 'up', 'spades', 'charm', 'can', 'put', 'over', 'song', 'only', 'weak', 'point', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'capable', 'actor', 'lines', 'way.The', 'songs', 'have', 'almost', 'become', 'hits', 'standards', 'bring', 'film', 'together.If', 'love', 'old', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'pop', 'hits', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'will', 'love', 'this.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

I've had the soundtrack since 1980, when the film was released, but somehow kept missing it on cable or TV and never thought to  rent it.I'd heard all the atrocious reviews and pans, but decided the  music, not to mention the one sequence I had seen on TV -- the Gene  Kelly/Olivia Newton-John dance number, was worth having in DVD  format.I'm glad I did.  OK...this is *not* a great film.  There was a  terrific concept here, but some bad writing gets in the way.  In addition,  some of the songs are not used to their full potential as backdrops for  sequences.  From the production notes on the DVD, it appears the script was  rushed...so no surprise.  So, given the words they have to say, I don't  fault the actors for their performances -- and they're not as wooden as  people say, in my opinion.Gene Kelly is charming no matter what you put  him in.  I don't know why people say &quot;What was he thinking?&quot; when  it comes to 'Xanadu.'  I can sense exactly what he was thinking: that this  film would be a wonderful fantasy and interesting fusion of the 40's and  80's.  He is so much fun to watch that even with bad writing, his smile  makes it all worth it.Then there is Olivia Newton-John...quite frankly,  perfect as the muse.  Again, given what the writers gave her...she delivers  fine.  She is so luminous and beautiful you cannot take your eyes off her.So -- if you want an eye appealing little movie to watch when there  are no others...try this one on for size.

I expected that the terry cloth hot pants and roller skates combined with ELO and Gene Kelly would be entertaining in it's own campy way. I have always liked Olivia Newton-John, and expected her to be brilliant as a muse in this movie. It turns out that all the brilliance that she had in this film was a bad neon back lit special effect. Olivia looks pretty, and Gene Kelly tries to be dapper, but overall, I can't say much for this one.I had never seen the movie before, and had no idea how awful it truly was. Some people have said that the movie is 'infectious and fun.' I found it mostly to be just infectious. The songs are more banal than I remembered from the soundtrack, and the poor acting and nearly nonexistent plot (culminating in a grotesque pageantry laden roller disco musical extravaganza that seemed to go on forever) made this a tough one to get through. I just felt sad for Gene Kelly (he must have really needed the money to wear the costumes they put him in). This must have been the experience of a lifetime for Michael Beck. This movie permanently sent him off to the 'where are they now?' file. When Olivia and Michael go off to meet her father (Zeus, who else) the film becomes painful to watch. (I never needed to hear Zeus bicker with his wife.)I think that if you like disco, and particularly ELO, and can tolerate really ugly clothes, horrid acting, and nearly complete absence of storyline then this movie might be for you.

This film had the misfortune to be shot at the end of the disco era and the beginning of the so-called ""New Wave"" movement, only to be released after disco had died HARD.  So, we are treated to a strange mix of 70's roller boogie/disco glitter, 40's nostalgia, and a premonition of 80's silliness to come (e.g., off the shoulder dresses, engineered hair--pass the mousse please, and leg warmers with flats).  A film in which the men wear shirts unbuttoned to their navels half the time AND one that includes leg warmers and big hair on the women in the other scenes is a strange juxtoposition indeed!I remember all the preceeding fads well, because I worked retail at the time, and believe me, I sold TONS of crap as seen in this film.  People can rip on it all they want, but those 70's and 80's fasion faux pas were hugely popular.If you can get past the tremendous cheese factor--or maybe you shouldn't--there are some lovely songs by Ms. Newton-John, several of which turned out to be pop hits, despite the commercial failure of the film.  The ""Whenever You're Away From Me"" song/dance duet is absolutely precious.  Gene Kelly is to be forgiven for that number alone.The DVD version of the film has some nice bounuses, including some production notes on ""What they were thinking"" when they devised this vehicle.

Fennell ""pianistcritic""","[2, 2]","First, let's dispense with the obvious; this is one of the goofiest little movies ever made......and it's also one of my favorites. (Okay, ""guilty pleasures"", say we say...) Much has been said about how silly this film is, and a lot of that is justified. However, this movie was released in theaters when I was 14 years old and madly in love with Olivia Newton-John, not to mention musicals in general. Everytime I see it, it takes me back to those times, and the people that I drove crazy with the Xanadu soundtrack album. :) The slight plot, which could have been better if the producers hadn't decided to edit out so many things, has an intriguing premise, but eventually becomes an excuse to get from one song to the next. (A visit to some of the Xanadu fan-sites can turn up some interesting cuts from the script that REALLY would helped have the plot along.) In the long run, that's not really a bad thing, though. Many old musicals that this film is mimicking used the same idea, and besides, the songs themselves are great. The love-it-or-hate-it free-for-all, ""Dancin'"", which melds the music of the 40's and the 80's together, is very creative, and few people seem to realize what a challenge it is to get something like that to actually work, musically. (Okay, fair enough, a lot of you say it DOESN'T work......aaah, to each his own.....) Olivia does exactly what her fans like to see her doing in this film; she sings a lot and looks beautiful, and what acting she has to do is pleasant enough. Michael Beck.....well......yeah,he's in the movie. Nuff' said. I've heard it rumored that Barry Manilow was originally approached for this role. Now wouldn't THAT have been a hoot? And of course, the legendary Gene Kelly turns up and injects some life into every scene that he's in, especially his tap-dance duet with Olivia, ""Whenever You're Away From Me"". The choreography by Kenny Ortega and Jerry Trent is maddening at times; what works on a stage doesn't necessarily work for a movie. Kinda makes you wish they had taken a 2nd look at some of the shots that were used. The opening scene where the 9 muses materialize is a good idea, but the dancing is just not precise enough and some of it looks just plain sloppy.  Even with all it's flaws, this is still a movie I love, just for the nostalgia of it all. I've seen it countless times, much to the disbelief, and slight embarrassment, of people who know me. :)",4,Memories of a happier time,1015372800,"03 6, 2002",2002,2424,"['First', 'let', 'dispense', 'obvious', 'one', 'goofiest', 'little', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'also', 'one', 'favorites', 'Okay', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'say', 'say', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'how', 'silly', 'film', 'lot', 'justified', 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', '14', 'years', 'old', 'madly', 'love', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'not', 'mention', 'musicals', 'general', 'Everytime', 'see', 'back', 'times', 'people', 'drove', 'crazy', 'Xanadu', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'slight', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'producers', 'had', ""n't"", 'decided', 'edit', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'eventually', 'excuse', 'get', 'one', 'song', 'next', 'visit', 'Xanadu', 'fan-sites', 'can', 'turn', 'up', 'interesting', 'cuts', 'script', 'REALLY', 'would', 'helped', 'have', 'plot', 'long', 'run', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'thing', 'though', 'Many', 'old', 'musicals', 'film', 'mimicking', 'used', 'same', 'idea', 'besides', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'love-it-or-hate-it', 'free-for-all', 'Dancin', 'music', '40', '80', 'together', 'very', 'creative', 'few', 'people', 'seem', 'realize', 'what', 'challenge', 'get', 'something', 'actually', 'work', 'musically', 'Okay', 'fair', 'enough', 'lot', 'say', ""N'T"", 'work', 'aaah', 'own', '..', 'Olivia', 'exactly', 'what', 'fans', 'see', 'doing', 'film', 'lot', 'beautiful', 'what', 'acting', 'do', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'Michael', 'Beck', '..well', 'yeah', 'movie', 'Nuff', 'said', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'rumored', 'Barry', 'Manilow', 'was', 'originally', 'approached', 'role', 'Now', 'would', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'have', 'been', 'hoot', 'course', 'legendary', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'up', 'injects', 'life', 'scene', 'especially', 'tap-dance', 'duet', 'Olivia', ""'re"", 'Away', 'Me', 'choreography', 'Kenny', 'Ortega', 'Jerry', 'Trent', 'maddening', 'times', 'what', 'stage', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'work', 'movie', 'Kinda', 'wish', 'had', 'taken', '2nd', 'look', 'shots', 'were', 'used', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', '9', 'muses', 'materialize', 'good', 'idea', 'dancing', 'just', 'not', 'precise', 'enough', 'just', 'plain', 'sloppy', 'Even', 'flaws', 'still', 'movie', 'love', 'just', 'nostalgia', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'much', 'disbelief', 'slight', 'embarrassment', 'people', 'who', 'know']",N/A

The writing is awful, the dialogue is awful, the acting (with the exception of Gene Kelly) is awful, the costumes are awful.  It's frightening to think that somewhere in L.A. in 1979-1980, there sat a film executive thinking ""We'll take Olivia Newton-John, roller skating, ELO, the 1940s and the 1980s, mash it all together, make it into a musical and we'll have a hit!""""Xanadu"" is centered on Sonny, an artist who paints giant reproductions of album covers (they used to be hung outside of music stores back in the day).  Sonny (played with unbelievable blandness by Michael Beck) is unhappy and wants to really do something with his creativity.  Apparently his ""woe-is-me"" moment conjures up the mystical nine muses of Greek mythology - - they actually come to life on a painted mural in Venice Beach, to the snappy tune of ELO's ""I'm Alive"" -- but as soon as the tune is over, the ladies disburse to various parts of the globe, where apparently their divine intervention is needed.  Only Kira (Olivia Newton-John) stays behind in L.A. to help Sonny become more than just an album painter.  With the help of former bandleader Danny (Gene Kelly), Sonny plans to open a new nightclub in an abandoned Art Deco building - - by blending Danny's 1940s style and music with his own 1980s godawful designs, synthesizers and roller skates.  Kira is on standby to look pretty, break into song when necessary and participate in the musical numbers.This film has so many elements in it you wonder if either the film project changed hands many times before production, or the entire crew was on some sort of hallucinogenic drug.  We understand why Kira is on roller skates almost every time you see her - - after all, it is 1980 and the height of the roller boogie fad.  We understand, maybe, why Kira is attired in glam-peasant girl gear - - after all, she just popped off a wall.  We understand, even, why Gene Kelly took this film role - - had to be money.  But why on earth did the filmmakers find it necessary to demean Kelly with the terrible glitz-inspired fashion sequence toward the end, where he looks like nothing but an over-the-hill pimp?  And why, if Kira was such an inspirational muse who apparently inspired Danny some thirty-five years before, could she not inspire Sonny/Michael Beck to inject some life into his role?  What could have possibly made the director think that a cartoon/animated sequence in the middle of the film, with Kira and Sonny turned into various fish, made sense?And yet, even as frightening as some of these images are, the film is strangely addictive and enjoyable.  You cannot possibly watch ""Xanadu"" without tapping your foot or simply jumping up and dancing along to ELO's oh-so-early 80s tunes.  You can't watch without smiling over how dorky everyone looked on roller skates back in 1980.  You can't watch and not shake your head in amazement over the fact that Sonny and Danny's 1940s meets 1980s nightclub/rollerskating club will probably fail miserably and make them social outcasts in L.A. (not to mention, probably getting Kira fired from her job as a wall muse).But, watch it you must - - if you are a fan of Olivia Newton-John, you will love seeing her at the height of her radiant beauty and listening to the catchy ""Magic"" and title ""Xanadu"" songs.  For the classic film fan, this is Gene Kelly in his last film performance.  The scene with him and Newton-John dancing together, and singing a 40s-era inspired song is sweet and a reminder to what a treasure he was to Hollywood.But the main reason to watch - - to see bad, bad cinema at its absolute finest.Highly recommended.",4,So Incredibly Bad It's Good,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,3731,"['Xanadu', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'so', 'awful', 'aspect', 'enjoyably', 'good.Where', 'begin', 'writing', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'awful', 'acting', 'exception', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'awful', 'costumes', 'are', 'awful', 'frightening', 'think', 'somewhere', 'L.A.', '1979-1980', 'film', 'executive', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'roller', 'skating', 'ELO', '1940s', '1980s', 'mash', 'together', 'make', 'musical', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hit', 'Xanadu', 'centered', 'Sonny', 'artist', 'who', 'giant', 'reproductions', 'album', 'covers', 'used', 'be', 'hung', 'music', 'stores', 'back', 'day', 'Sonny', 'played', 'unbelievable', 'blandness', 'Michael', 'Beck', 'unhappy', 'really', 'do', 'something', 'creativity', 'Apparently', 'woe-is-me', 'moment', 'up', 'mystical', 'nine', 'muses', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'actually', 'come', 'life', 'painted', 'mural', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'snappy', 'tune', 'ELO', ""'m"", 'Alive', 'as', 'soon', 'tune', 'ladies', 'disburse', 'various', 'parts', 'globe', 'where', 'apparently', 'divine', 'intervention', 'needed', 'Only', 'Kira', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'L.A.', 'help', 'Sonny', 'become', 'more', 'just', 'album', 'painter', 'help', 'former', 'bandleader', 'Danny', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Sonny', 'open', 'new', 'nightclub', 'abandoned', 'Art', 'Deco', 'building', 'blending', 'Danny', '1940s', 'style', 'music', 'own', '1980s', 'godawful', 'designs', 'synthesizers', 'roller', 'skates', 'Kira', 'standby', 'look', 'pretty', 'break', 'song', 'when', 'necessary', 'participate', 'musical', 'numbers.This', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'wonder', 'film', 'project', 'changed', 'hands', 'many', 'times', 'production', 'entire', 'crew', 'was', 'sort', 'hallucinogenic', 'drug', 'understand', 'why', 'Kira', 'roller', 'skates', 'almost', 'time', 'see', '1980', 'height', 'roller', 'boogie', 'fad', 'understand', 'maybe', 'why', 'Kira', 'attired', 'glam-peasant', 'girl', 'gear', 'just', 'popped', 'off', 'wall', 'understand', 'even', 'why', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'took', 'film', 'role', 'had', 'be', 'money', 'why', 'earth', 'did', 'filmmakers', 'find', 'necessary', 'demean', 'Kelly', 'terrible', 'glitz-inspired', 'fashion', 'sequence', 'end', 'where', 'nothing', 'over-the-hill', 'pimp', 'why', 'Kira', 'was', 'such', 'inspirational', 'muse', 'who', 'apparently', 'inspired', 'Danny', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'could', 'not', 'inspire', 'Sonny/Michael', 'Beck', 'inject', 'life', 'role', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'made', 'director', 'think', 'cartoon/animated', 'sequence', 'middle', 'film', 'Kira', 'Sonny', 'turned', 'various', 'fish', 'made', 'sense', 'yet', 'even', 'as', 'frightening', 'images', 'are', 'film', 'strangely', 'addictive', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'watch', 'Xanadu', 'tapping', 'foot', 'simply', 'jumping', 'up', 'dancing', 'along', 'ELO', 'oh-so-early', '80s', 'tunes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'smiling', 'over', 'how', 'dorky', 'everyone', 'looked', 'roller', 'skates', 'back', '1980', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'not', 'shake', 'head', 'amazement', 'fact', 'Sonny', 'Danny', '1940s', 'meets', '1980s', 'nightclub/rollerskating', 'club', 'will', 'probably', 'fail', 'miserably', 'make', 'social', 'outcasts', 'L.A.', 'not', 'mention', 'probably', 'getting', 'Kira', 'fired', 'job', 'wall', 'muse', '.But', 'watch', 'must', 'are', 'fan', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'will', 'love', 'seeing', 'height', 'radiant', 'beauty', 'listening', 'catchy', 'Magic', 'title', 'Xanadu', 'songs', 'classic', 'film', 'fan', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'last', 'film', 'performance', 'scene', 'Newton-John', 'dancing', 'together', 'singing', '40s-era', 'inspired', 'song', 'sweet', 'reminder', 'what', 'treasure', 'was', 'Hollywood.But', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'see', 'bad', 'bad', 'cinema', 'absolute', 'finest.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

That being said, it's terrific in a bad sort of way and you'll find yourself engrossed with it, waiting to see what else could possibly happen.Oliva Newton-John  actually looks like she's having a good time in her first post-""Grease"" film.  She paired with an Andy Gibb clone (Michael Beck) who can't act his way out of a paper bag but he was probably hired because he looked great on the covers of teen magazines.  Gene Kelly (in one of his last movie rolls) is also on hand.The plot involves a muse named Kira (Newton-John) sent down to Earth to inspire artist Beck.  He falls for her and meets up with Kelly, who was inspired by Kira in the 1940s.  The duo decide to open a 1940s-1980s fusion club in an abandoned building.The musical numbers are all way over the top.  From the wall mural the comes to live during ""I'm Alive', Beck and Newton-John skating through a recording studio where props magically appear during ""Suddenly"", a giant stage where the Tubes and a 1940's zoot suit band combine during ""Dancin'"", each performance tops the number before it.Just when you thought you've seen it all, there's a Don Bluth animated scene, and a number set in a funky early 1980s boutique during ""All Over the World"".  But that's only the beginning.  The finale will make you wonder how the producers of the film could make this movie with a straight face.  Let's just say it involves circus acts, mimes, a giant rotating floor with lights and fountains, and lots of dancing and skating.The movie may not have done well when it was first released but soundtrack isn't half bad.  It contains hits such as ""Suddenly"", ""Magic"", and ""Xanadu"".  ELO contributed many songs with the mistaken assumption that this movie was the next ""Saturday Night Fever"" and they would become as rich as the Bee Gees.The film print is mostly good quality, and the disc is presented in widesceen.

Gene Kelly is delightful in one of his last roles, and dances nimbly with ONJ to ""Whenever You're Away From Me.""

I mean this film exudes so much estrogen I get hot flashes just watching it. However the letters, ONJ and ELO make it all worth watching. That is Olvia Newton John and Electric light orchestra do the soundtrack for this film. Not too mention the film stars the beautiful Aussie ONJ in all her youthful glory. This was before she got the lesbo cut for the physical video.The dialog is so silly that it just screams for Rocky Horror like audience participation quips. Here's an example:Sonny:You!ONJ:Me!...Sonny:So do you think we could-ONJ:See each other again?Sonny:Yeah would you like that?ONJ:Why?Sonny:I don't know I don't have a very good reason. I just wanna see you again.Smooth Sonny, real smooth.The whole plot is so baffling it's really not worth going into. But I'll try. ONJ plays Kira one of Zeus's daughters, the muses. After watching this though you may think she's really one of Zeus's other group of daughters, the three fates- the one the cuts the strings that is.Sonny is a starving artist forced to take a corporate job in order to make ends meet. Kira shows up and tells him to follow his dreams-build a huge roller disco. Wait a minute that's not his goal at all! Kira's goal is to build the roller disco-she just tricks this poor boy into thinking its his idea!!!Apparently being a muse means making guys fall in love with you in order to inspire them and then leaving them high and dry. Thanks a lot Kira, you inspire me to do something really stupid like build a huge neon roller disco and leave me with the huge bills that are sure to accompany it.There's a cool cartoon sequence, a song they sing while skating in some studio of the future where they are attacked by what looks like a huge Dalek, as well as a song where they are picking out clothes and being followed by a bunch of gay guys.The music really holds this film together and if you don't like either artist, ONJ or ELO I would not recommend you watch this because you will find yourself in a world full of hurt.

I cannot agree.This is a curiosity item only, in cinematic history.  From perhaps a time (pre-MTV), when everyone and anyone was hopped up on whatever the drug of choice was back then in Hollyweird.  I KNOW this is a ""fantasy"" film, but why'd they have to make it so bad?  Namely, by constantly undercutting/interrupting potentially interesting flashy/romantic effects sequences with extremely boring and overlong, badly written, directed, and acted segments, and lots of unnecessary and tasteless ""camp?""  And with an uncomfortable and weird mixture of 40's ""swing"" with the beginnings of bad 80's ""Reagan-era"" pop/rock.This is ""Saturday Night Fever"" mixed with ""Cats"" mixed with your average early ""music video"" produced on bad mushrooms and/or too much caffeine, shown with a goofy cartoon not at the beginning of the film, but somewhere in the middle!  Not that it's all bad.  There are a lot of pretty colors, lots of interesting special effects (for its time), some catchy tunes (especially ""Xanadu""), but overall it's just a total misfire on almost every other level.  Especially with the total lack of believable writing and ""acting"" that is universally awful, even from the legend Gene Kelly.  And long, overlong, unimaginative, laughable ""real life"" storyline scenes with acting performances which are sad to watch because this was evidently the script they were handed with and nobody objected.A shame in a way.  With a few re-writes, this could've been something special.  It does, but too rarely, capture a wild, visual/musical abandon, but it does little with the idea with way too much drab, plastic filler.  Olivia is about the only saving grace here, her striking beauty and angelic voice second to none, but alas, lost in all the muck and mud.  As are Gene Kelly's forced contributions, which are embarrassing at best.  The rest of the cast is totally forgettable and obviously talentless.  Even the semi-prog rock/pop band ""Electric Light Orchestra"" is wasted here.  And it appears that this was some sort of ""showcase"" for them.I had seen this originally when or shortly after it was released, and only recently saw it again on cable.  It's as out-of-touch in the final analysis, now, as it was back then.  Some applaud this for it's ""up with people"" spirit, but from my last viewing to my most recent, I find it strangely, and sadly, depressing.  Because for every good minute here, there are four or five or six bad ones the viewer must suffer through.  Unnecessarily, I think.I'd strongly recommend ANYONE actually considering buying this sight unseen, to forget all reviews, good or bad, and at least rent or try to catch it on cable first, before laying down actual money for this.  For all its flashiness, and some visual innovations, for its length there is really only about 10 minutes or so of half decent musical, romantic fluff fantasy visually acceptable material here.  That's a very poor ratio, even for supposedly movies so bad that they're ""good.""  You do the math.There is really only one bottom line ""good"" thing going about this overall mess.  Discerning viewers with taste who insist on watching this more than once will at least quickly get to know which long, tedious parts to fast forward through upon repeated viewings.",1,"A flashy, mostly bad experience...",1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,3355,"['lot', 'people', 'seem', 'describe', 'one', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'can', 'not', 'agree.This', 'curiosity', 'item', 'only', 'cinematic', 'history', 'perhaps', 'time', 'pre-MTV', 'when', 'everyone', 'anyone', 'was', 'hopped', 'up', 'drug', 'choice', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'Hollyweird', 'KNOW', 'fantasy', 'film', 'why', ""'d"", 'have', 'make', 'so', 'bad', 'Namely', 'constantly', 'undercutting/interrupting', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'flashy/romantic', 'effects', 'sequences', 'extremely', 'boring', 'overlong', 'badly', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'segments', 'lots', 'unnecessary', 'tasteless', 'camp', 'uncomfortable', 'weird', 'mixture', '40', 'swing', 'beginnings', 'bad', '80', 'Reagan-era', 'pop/rock.This', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'mixed', 'Cats', 'mixed', 'average', 'early', 'music', 'video', 'produced', 'bad', 'mushrooms', 'and/or', 'too', 'much', 'caffeine', 'shown', 'goofy', 'cartoon', 'not', 'beginning', 'film', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Not', 'bad', 'are', 'lot', 'pretty', 'colors', 'lots', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'especially', 'Xanadu', 'overall', 'just', 'total', 'misfire', 'almost', 'other', 'level', 'Especially', 'total', 'lack', 'believable', 'writing', 'acting', 'universally', 'awful', 'even', 'legend', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'long', 'overlong', 'unimaginative', 'laughable', 'real', 'life', 'storyline', 'scenes', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'sad', 'watch', 'was', 'evidently', 'script', 'were', 'handed', 'nobody', 'objected.A', 'shame', 'way', 'few', 're-writes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'something', 'special', 'too', 'rarely', 'capture', 'wild', 'visual/musical', 'abandon', 'little', 'idea', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'drab', 'plastic', 'filler', 'Olivia', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'here', 'striking', 'beauty', 'angelic', 'voice', 'second', 'none', 'alas', 'lost', 'muck', 'mud', 'are', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'forced', 'contributions', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'best', 'rest', 'cast', 'totally', 'forgettable', 'obviously', 'talentless', 'Even', 'semi-prog', 'rock/pop', 'band', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'wasted', 'here', 'was', 'sort', 'showcase', 'them.I', 'had', 'seen', 'originally', 'when', 'shortly', 'was', 'released', 'only', 'recently', 'saw', 'again', 'cable', 'out-of-touch', 'final', 'analysis', 'now', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'applaud', 'people', 'spirit', 'last', 'viewing', 'most', 'recent', 'find', 'strangely', 'sadly', 'depressing', 'good', 'minute', 'here', 'are', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'bad', 'ones', 'viewer', 'must', 'suffer', 'Unnecessarily', 'think.I', ""'d"", 'strongly', 'recommend', 'ANYONE', 'actually', 'considering', 'buying', 'sight', 'unseen', 'forget', 'reviews', 'good', 'bad', 'least', 'rent', 'try', 'catch', 'cable', 'first', 'laying', 'down', 'actual', 'money', 'flashiness', 'visual', 'innovations', 'length', 'really', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'half', 'decent', 'musical', 'romantic', 'fluff', 'fantasy', 'visually', 'acceptable', 'material', 'here', 'very', 'poor', 'ratio', 'even', 'supposedly', 'movies', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'good', 'do', 'math.There', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'bottom', 'line', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'overall', 'mess', 'Discerning', 'viewers', 'taste', 'who', 'insist', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'will', 'least', 'quickly', 'get', 'know', 'long', 'tedious', 'parts', 'fast', 'forward', 'upon', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

201502,A1O4TMKKT0XZTJ,6300182320,"Tim Edstrom ""Tim""","[1, 1]","One strong theme in the American arts is the idea of transformation of person. The New World has been envisioned as a place without an entrenched aristocracy, where people can leave behind a former self and begin anew. This theme, before reaching fruition in Xanadu in 1980, was exemplified in three works: Benjamin Franklin's The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Horatio Alger's rags-to-riches tales, and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. This is refected primarily in two motifs: 1). the transformation of an abandoned roller skating rink into a vintage fin-de-decade 70s roller disco rink and 2). the recurring cartooned versions of certain characters, a literal transformation of self that is entirely controlled.Astonishingly, there is little in Xanadu to betray its 24-year gestation period. Whimsy, satire, and tart sympathy are kept in nimble balance throughout the gorgeous musical, and even if Gene Kelly's life defies the laws of logic, it has all the buoyant integrity of a Chagall painting. It has rightly been called, by amateur film critic Tim Edstrom, the most important film to reflect on issues of women's emancipation.In Xanadu, we also see the passing of the torch between Old Hollywood in the form of Gene Kelly and New Hollywood, brilliantly displayed in the form of Australian actress Olivia Newton-John.",5,Xanadu: Fruition of a Great American Theme.,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,1336,"['One', 'strong', 'theme', 'American', 'arts', 'idea', 'transformation', 'person', 'New', 'World', 'been', 'envisioned', 'place', 'entrenched', 'aristocracy', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'leave', 'former', 'self', 'begin', 'anew', 'theme', 'reaching', 'fruition', 'Xanadu', '1980', 'was', 'exemplified', 'three', 'works', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Autobiography', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Horatio', 'Alger', 'rags-to-riches', 'tales', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'refected', 'primarily', 'two', 'motifs', '1', 'transformation', 'abandoned', 'roller', 'skating', 'rink', 'vintage', 'fin-de-decade', '70s', 'roller', 'disco', 'rink', '2', 'recurring', 'cartooned', 'versions', 'certain', 'characters', 'literal', 'transformation', 'self', 'entirely', 'controlled.Astonishingly', 'little', 'Xanadu', 'betray', '24-year', 'gestation', 'period', 'Whimsy', 'satire', 'tart', 'sympathy', 'are', 'kept', 'nimble', 'balance', 'gorgeous', 'musical', 'even', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'life', 'laws', 'logic', 'buoyant', 'integrity', 'Chagall', 'painting', 'rightly', 'been', 'called', 'amateur', 'film', 'critic', 'Tim', 'Edstrom', 'most', 'important', 'film', 'reflect', 'issues', 'women', 'emancipation.In', 'Xanadu', 'also', 'see', 'passing', 'torch', 'Old', 'Hollywood', 'form', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'New', 'Hollywood', 'brilliantly', 'displayed', 'form', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John']",N/A

201506,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,6300182320,Twiddles42,"[2, 2]","Why is this movie so badly rated?* The acting:  Yes, some of the side parts are pedestrianly acted.  But the leads (Newton-John, Beck, Kelly) put in competent performances.  Acting grade when averaged:  B* The movie's concept:  Follow your dreams despite the harshness of reality.  Re-live your past upon the realization of age.  The concepts are presented without so much a hint of malice or irritability.  But more on presentation in a moment.  If anything, it's simple by today's standards.  In 1980, it must've been too much for ordinary audiences.  Concept grade:  A-* The movie's presentation:  In a word - ""conceptual"".  Roll with the concept and you'll be hooked from the start.  There is an innocent, organic, ""real"" feel to a movie that uses visual cues more often than dialogue to promote its point.  Case in point is the opening ~10 minutes.  An annoyed artist who feels pursuing his dreams is a waste of time takes a distinguished sketch and tears it up; the shreds floating down and, without explanation, causes these mystical painted figures to become alive -- the expressions on their faces is that of the joy of escaping a painted backdrop.  It's almost the perfect metaphor for life in general:  A soul released into the world...  The grade for presentation:  A-* The token tacky moment:  An inverse grade; every movie has one really cringe-inducing moment, and it's a matter of judging how infamous this moment affects the whole movie experience.  For me, said scene is the roller skating with the sync-clapping ""extravaganza"".  Yes, this is where some legitimate vomiting would be allowed.  Wonderfully choreographed, yes, and impeccable given the fantasy nature of the film, but it feels claustrophobic in spite of it all and it's also the sort of thing you would not want to see if you went to a skating rink for real.  Especially if someone sneezed at just the wrong moment.  Fantasy is surely more than a big roller skating rink, how much in 1980 was?  Mind you, this scene is the climax of the metaphor OF the roller skates, which is whimsical freedom.  Token tacky moment grade:  C.  (at least it isn't A, which for any other category would be an F...)* The songs:  A perfect fit for this movie; these songs hold up on their own extremely well and are, in a word, ""enchanting"".  Now ELO is not usually my ""cup of tea"", but their song ""I'm Alive"" is one of the most uplifting songs I've ever listened to.  Never mind Olivia's ""Magic"", which is more powerful than a chorus of Sirens...  A definite no-brainer, the grade for the songs:  A+* The special effects: Many were easy to achieve in 1980.  Not all were so easy, and in 2008 they look dated.  All effects do.  While not perfect, then or now, they do adequately convey the feel of innocence we all need more of in our lives.  Grade:  C+Overall rating:  B+All in all, I just can't understand why this movie is poorly rated.  Make your dreams or be a slave.  And the movie makes the point without being sarcastic, callous, or jaded.

There are many factors that will determine your streaming experience, so I pray to the movie gods to release this on Blu Ray already!!",5,Great Movie Bad Streaming,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,780,"['movie', 'hero', 'journey', 'importance', 'pursuing', 'dreams', 'acting', 'bad', 'story', 'music', 'are', 'awesome', 'truly', 'magickal', 'movie.The', 'streaming', 'however', 'was', 'terrible', 'have', 'very', 'fast', 'internet', 'connection', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'problem', 'Netflix', 'reason', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'was', 'pixelated', 'choppy', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'HD', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'picture', 'watched', 'old', 'VHS', 'copy.The', 'problem', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'issues', 'internet', 'connection', 'Amazon', 'app', 'PS3', 'even', 'sunspots', 'are', 'things', 'take', 'consideration', 'buying', 'streaming', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'factors', 'will', 'determine', 'streaming', 'experience', 'pray', 'movie', 'gods', 'release', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'already']",N/A
