1129232,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001132GNY,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 9]","A lot of people have been praising this movie up and down to the point where I felt it was necessary for me to watch it.  I remember when the film was first released and I had an interest in seeing it so when the DVD came out I decided to go ahead and give it a try.  What I found was a decent film wrapped up in so much hype that it ultimately became a big letdown.  If it hadn't received all the praise it had then maybe I would have enjoyed it more.  It's not that this is a bad film; it's just far from superb.The film revolves around four couples, eight friends, as they travel to a cabin for a week of reflecting on their marriages and how they can strengthen them.  There is Terry and Diane, Patricia and Gavin, Marcus and Angela and Sheila and Mike.  All of them have their own issues to work out with one another and this week is supposed to therapeutically help them along in that effort.  Terry and Diane for instance have a scheduling problem.  Diane's job is going really well and so she spends all of her time working leaving her husband Terry to feel neglected and alone.  Marcus and Angela are always fighting, mainly because Angela has a drinking problem and can't seem to keep her cool around Marcus' baby-momma.  Mike and Sheila have the worst relationship of the bunch.  It's apparent from the start that Mike is uninterested with Sheila because of her weight problem and thus neglects and belittles her every chance he can.  The final couple is Patricia and Gavin, the perfect couple so-to-speak.  Patricia is a famous author of the book `Why Did I Get Married' where she writes of her friends and their revelations together on their little therapeutic getaways.  They annoy me, but I'll get to that in a minute.Over the course of the week all four marriages are put to the test and they all make some changes in their lives.  Sadly I didn't really care for anyone, except Sheila and Terry.  Really no one else was all that sympathetic or tolerable.  Angela is funny but she's not a good wife.  Diane is pretty but she's unsympathetic.  Gavin is vacant and boring.  Mike is obnoxious and a horrific husband.  Marcus is not all that bad in that I understand where he's coming from but he's still no saint.  Patricia, don't get me started.  She's the main reason I was so disappointed with this film.  She's preaching and annoying and Janet Jackson's performance is horrendous.I guess that's my biggest problem with `Why Did I Get Married?'; it's overly preachy.  I felt like I was watching a lecture on what not to do when you're married.  I didn't feel like I was connecting to anyone on the screen really.  I felt like I was just being told various scenarios of how marriages can struggle and what we should do to overcome our differences.  None of these couples felt real to me.  Sure, I was touched and saddened by the way that Sheila was treated by Mike but I think anyone would be.In the end I have to say that I don't get all the praise and admiration.  Yes, `Why Did I Get Married?' is a decent film with a good message but it doesn't deliver that message the best it could have and it never reaches the heights that it should have.  There are some nice performances (most notably from Tyler Perry and Tasha Smith) but then there are some horrendous ones (yes, I'm looking at you Miss Jackson) that take away from this film drastically.",3,"Yes, it's a decent movie; no, it's not fantastic...",1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,3364,"['lot', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'praising', 'movie', 'up', 'down', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'necessary', 'watch', 'remember', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'so', 'when', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'give', 'try', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'wrapped', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'ultimately', 'became', 'big', 'letdown', 'had', ""n't"", 'received', 'praise', 'had', 'then', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'far', 'superb.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'four', 'couples', 'eight', 'friends', 'travel', 'cabin', 'week', 'reflecting', 'marriages', 'how', 'can', 'strengthen', 'Terry', 'Diane', 'Patricia', 'Gavin', 'Marcus', 'Angela', 'Sheila', 'Mike', 'have', 'own', 'issues', 'work', 'out', 'one', 'week', 'supposed', 'therapeutically', 'help', 'along', 'effort', 'Terry', 'Diane', 'instance', 'have', 'scheduling', 'problem', 'Diane', 'job', 'going', 'really', 'well', 'so', 'time', 'working', 'leaving', 'husband', 'Terry', 'feel', 'neglected', 'alone', 'Marcus', 'Angela', 'are', 'always', 'fighting', 'mainly', 'Angela', 'drinking', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'cool', 'Marcus', 'baby-momma', 'Mike', 'Sheila', 'have', 'worst', 'relationship', 'bunch', 'apparent', 'start', 'Mike', 'uninterested', 'Sheila', 'weight', 'problem', 'thus', 'neglects', 'chance', 'can', 'final', 'couple', 'Patricia', 'Gavin', 'perfect', 'couple', 'so-to-speak', 'Patricia', 'famous', 'author', 'book', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'where', 'friends', 'revelations', 'together', 'little', 'therapeutic', 'getaways', 'annoy', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute.Over', 'course', 'week', 'four', 'marriages', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'make', 'changes', 'lives', 'Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'anyone', 'Sheila', 'Terry', 'Really', 'one', 'else', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'tolerable', 'Angela', 'funny', 'not', 'good', 'wife', 'Diane', 'pretty', 'unsympathetic', 'Gavin', 'vacant', 'boring', 'Mike', 'obnoxious', 'horrific', 'husband', 'Marcus', 'not', 'bad', 'understand', 'where', 'coming', 'still', 'saint', 'Patricia', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'main', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'film', 'preaching', 'annoying', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'performance', 'horrendous.I', 'guess', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'overly', 'preachy', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'lecture', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'when', ""'re"", 'married', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'connecting', 'anyone', 'screen', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'told', 'various', 'scenarios', 'how', 'marriages', 'can', 'struggle', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'overcome', 'differences', 'None', 'couples', 'felt', 'real', 'Sure', 'was', 'touched', 'saddened', 'way', 'Sheila', 'was', 'treated', 'Mike', 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'be.In', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'praise', 'admiration', 'Yes', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'decent', 'film', 'good', 'message', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'message', 'best', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'heights', 'should', 'have', 'are', 'nice', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Tasha', 'Smith', 'then', 'are', 'horrendous', 'ones', 'yes', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Miss', 'Jackson', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'drastically']",N/A

Nor do we like attempts to flatter us by making us, on screens, what we are not in everyday life. And we don't like being pushed off the screen altogether as the major producers seem to be doing.

I see the dogs(critics) are howling like crazy, disturbing the peace. Dey be lickin' dey wounds, and you keep hittin' dem Tyler so dey wound ain't had a chance to heal. You be bad boy oh! Can somebody please call 911? The racket they are making is tap dancing on my last nerve. Does anyone have a Goody powder for my awful headache and theirs? Give me a pigfoot and a bottle a beer. Yeah Lawdy!I will continue to support Tyler at the box off as long as he continues to bring us positive and realistic images of African Americans. Being sick of the garbage that is out there is an understatement, I hunger for a variety of depictions of black life. When I watch a movie I want to see myself, neighbors, friends, and family. We, African Americans, are such fantastic, gifted, innovative, and creative souls. There are so many voices, yet to be heard. I appreciate that Tyler has been able to break through and tell some of our stories.It was such a pleasure to see beautiful and well-dressed normal black folks on the screen that I could actually relate to.People like me don't even listen to the ""so-called"" critics. They don't know diggly squat, and the people proved them wrong and left egg on their face. This is why they and their ilk are so hopping mad.I have seen this movie six times. No I am not some crazed fanatic. I have not seen any of Tyler's stage productions. The haters infuriated me, therefore, propelling me into action. I even convinced some non-Tyler fans to go. Because I was so mad. They loved the movie. Some of these folks I dragged along are some serious bootleg customers. But I convinced them of the importance of buying a ticket to support the bottom line. When you buy bootleg, you aren't supporting the artist. You are supporting the bootlegger. We must feed the loa(Tyler). They hemmed and hawed, but some agreed to accompany me. Let's make the haters even madder y'all. Let's collectively help Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married keep raking in the dough.Pros:There is eye candy for the men.There is eye candy for the women.There is humor.There is pain.There is laughter.There is joy.There is disappointment.The movie just depicts life and all that accompanies the journey.Donny Hathaway's song ""Giving Up"" as part of the sound track is a treat. Jennifer Holiday puts her foot all up in it. Go girl!There were no lurid sex scenes, profanity, and nearly naked women.The actors were well dressed. No baggy pants, etc.The characters were all realistic. I know all of these people.Tyler's character, Terry, mentioned Africa without disdain.Cons:I love everything about the movie, accept when Janet walks into the house, sets her bag down, and goes straight to the refrigerator and begins to prepare dinner, without washing her hands. I am like ""aww naww!"" Tyler baby what were you thinking.Movie Etiquette:Folks keep your crying babies at home. If you can't afford a baby sitter, a responsible and mature parent(s) should stay at home with their child. It is so incredibly thoughtless and inconsiderate. You simply diminish other movie goers enjoyment by having them endure a crying baby. I believe children under 13 should not be in a movie like this. Any person who can't sit still and be relatively quiet so the other folks can enjoy the movie should not be allowed in the theatre. It just pisses me off to no end. I now go to the manager and demand y'all be removed. Dog gone it y'all make me so dang mad!I know that black culture is interactive. I know we witness and testify in church and the theatre, etc. Can I get a witness? In black culture we don't sit back like a stump on a log, we participate and let the speaker or screen no if we are feelin' the presentation. If we sit back and make no comments or witness to what is being said, we are hellified bored with what is going on and can't wait to get the heck up out of there. It is simply who we are. We talk back. We are a call and response culture. However, constant talking during the movie is extreme and prevents others from hearing the dialogue. So shut the heck up. Okay that is my rant.Honorable Mention:One of favorite lines is when Angie's husband said something to the effect ""you weren't talkin' all that when I was in the NFL."" Angie replies ""yeah, 2 years of the NFL, 8 years of broke - touch down!"" I hollered.Secondly, the dinner scene is a classic. I enjoyed it immensely.Wish List:It would be so nice to see Lamman(Sheriff Troy) in another of your movies down the line. He sure is ""purty."" Also, I would like to see Sean Blakemore. He ""purty"" too , but manly looking. I think the ladies will like him. It is good to have eye candy for women. They look like real men.Conclusion:I give this movie 5 stars. I absolutely recommend it. Tyler great job and I am expecting more great things from you. I wish that every sistah could have her a Sheriff Troy.The End.Big Sistah PatKissinashe@blogspot.com",5,Tyler Workin' It!

1129240,A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B001132GNY,"Chandler ""Infamous""","[2, 2]","Very rarely would I watch a Tyler Perry movie (lately I've thinking that since he has money, he thinks he can do whatever he wants to do). But checking out ""Why Did I Get Married"" on Valentines day for the first time, and seeing it again last night, I believe this is an excellent movie.The movie surrounds itself around four married couples, going up on a family vacation to the mountains, and ends up getting caught in some drama at the dinner table. Then each couple goes through some issues to save their marrage. The acting is pretty good and convencing that really pulls you into the movie, espically the lady Jill Scott plays (the way she acted in that movie, don't get on her bad side...lol). Janet Jackson, and Tyler Perry don't do a bad job themselves playing their parts as well.

If Jill Scott's ""My New Man Is God's Answer To Prayer"" speech had you weeping at the end...you're WAY too easy.

1129245,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B001132GNY,Daddy,"[1, 1]","I should preface by stating that I love Tyler Perry movies.  His stage and screen works are excellent.  This movie version of the play, however, is low on my list of favorites.  While, technically, WHY DID I GET MARRIED? is a great film, I was very put off by the character of Mike (played by Richard T Jones) who continually abuses and berates his overweight wife (Played by Jill Scott).  I am so put off by his character that I sometimes skim over his parts when I watch the movie on DVD (I've watched the movie many times and enjoy it, on the whole).  I understand why Tyler Perry wrote that character and it was very well played by Jones.  However, his constant verbal abuse and total disregard of his wife seems to go too far.  Is anyone really that much of a pig?  Even if his character is believable, it's just too much for me to watch.  And the wife seems a little too self-pitying for my taste.  I would prefer to see a stronger female character in her.  I should add, however, that the rest of the characters are outstanding.  I particularly like the characters of the slightly confused husband dealing with his loud-mouth, boozing wife (Michael Jai White and Tasha Smith). It's particularly good when the husband finally takes a stand against his current boozing wife and his ex-wife who interferes.  The characters of the couple who are still dealing with the loss of their child (Janet Jackson and Malik Yoba) are excellent.  The scene where they break down and cry about the night their son died, thus letting out all their pent up feelings, is the best part of their story.  Then, of course, there's the power couple (Tyler Perry and Sharon Leal) who need to work out their troubles.  Tyler Perry's character seems to be the strongest and best part of the movie.  His character has the most depth, I think.  With the exception of the abusive husband character (Jones), most of the characters in this movie are easy to relate to.  The story is well done and captures your attention.  The dialogue is realistic and flows well.  Despite my three-star rating, which I only assigned because of the one flawed character of the abusive Mike, I highly recommend it.",3,Mixed feelings about a very good movie.,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,2172,"['should', 'preface', 'stating', 'love', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movies', 'stage', 'screen', 'works', 'are', 'excellent', 'movie', 'version', 'play', 'however', 'low', 'list', 'favorites', 'technically', 'WHY', 'DID', 'GET', 'MARRIED', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'put', 'off', 'character', 'Mike', 'played', 'Richard', 'T', 'Jones', 'who', 'continually', 'abuses', 'overweight', 'wife', 'Played', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'am', 'so', 'put', 'off', 'character', 'sometimes', 'skim', 'parts', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'understand', 'why', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'wrote', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Jones', 'However', 'constant', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'total', 'disregard', 'wife', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'anyone', 'really', 'much', 'pig', 'Even', 'character', 'believable', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'watch', 'wife', 'little', 'too', 'self-pitying', 'taste', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'stronger', 'female', 'character', 'should', 'add', 'however', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'outstanding', 'particularly', 'characters', 'slightly', 'confused', 'husband', 'dealing', 'loud-mouth', 'boozing', 'wife', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'Tasha', 'Smith', 'particularly', 'good', 'when', 'husband', 'finally', 'stand', 'current', 'boozing', 'wife', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'characters', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'dealing', 'loss', 'child', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'Malik', 'Yoba', 'are', 'excellent', 'scene', 'where', 'break', 'down', 'cry', 'night', 'son', 'died', 'thus', 'letting', 'out', 'pent', 'feelings', 'best', 'part', 'story', 'Then', 'course', 'power', 'couple', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Sharon', 'Leal', 'who', 'need', 'work', 'out', 'troubles', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'character', 'be', 'strongest', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'character', 'most', 'depth', 'think', 'exception', 'abusive', 'husband', 'character', 'Jones', 'most', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'easy', 'relate', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'attention', 'dialogue', 'realistic', 'well', 'three-star', 'rating', 'only', 'assigned', 'one', 'flawed', 'character', 'abusive', 'Mike', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Perry is especially good at showing how we all misperceive the happenings and interactions of our relationships, and in so doing, our misperception can either snowball into a divorce/break-up or a curtain-raising moment of realization, where our love is only strengthened. I am not an African American, nor am I a Christian. However,with his movies, sometimes over the top, sometimes formulaic, Tyler Perry seems to be doing something great for these two large communities in the US.

1129252,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001132GNY,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","WHY DID I GET MARRIEDTyler Perry is one of today's best filmmakers and truly one of my favorite writers out there, I like to say that he writes people and not characters [aside from Medea & Mr. Brown]. I have enjoyed every one of his films, plays, and TV shows and can't wait for his next project to come out. This film may be one of my favorites from the bunch because I think it was just told so right, from the production value to the acting everything seemed to be perfect at least to this reviewer. Mr. Perry has once again crafted a wonderful and entertaining film that I truly believe most people would enjoy, particularly those in a relationship.The film is a bit different from the play but that is fine because the movie worked out beautifully. It is all about a group of couples who make sure to get together at least once a year at some place, it is different every year I believe in the film version. This year they decide to go to a cabin out in the mountains even though some are not particularly happy about the snow. Still the group of friends come together to have a good time and reconnect with each other. One couple seems as if they are the perfect couple [Jackson & Yoba] while another is the epitome of a bad relationship [White & Smith]. Then you have a seemingly normal couple who just have normal problems [Perry & Leal] and of course the couple with an abusive spouse [Scott & Jones]. It is that relationship alone that will have you wanting to see what happens next. Of course these are just your outside characteristics because each one of these couples are going threw more then they are letting on. Over the course of this wonderful film you will see what true friendships are all about a follow these characters as they grow and develop. From the good times together to the horrible ones amongst them selves this movie is truly entertaining. The scene in which they are all at the table eating while on the get together is worth any price of the film in my opinion.One of the interesting things here is the dynamic between the groups, each having such a different feel but at the same time the same. For instance this film is truly about couples and how they react to things that one another do, but this movie is also a good showcase for how male friends act with one another compared to female friends. Over all both groups act the same with one another but in a little different way. Both talk about private things amongst one another but the female group seems talk more about the emotional side of things and at greater length. While the guys still do roughly the same thing they talk at a shorter length about things and talk more about the consequences of there actions.Tyler Perry has once again written people much like I mentioned earlier because these characters seem like they really here. The script is full of real life people in real life situations; in fact this movie is probably you and your friends. Maybe not exactly to a T but I am sure you can find something to relate to in here because no couple or group of friends are perfect. But what is perfect about this film is the casting of the actors to plays these people. I have to say that the MVP easily of this film is the marvelous Jill Scott who plays Sheila; her performance is masterful and truly heartfelt. Her character is the one that every one will get behind while watching this; her husband actually makes her drive to the place while he and the girl he is cheating with fly there. What makes that even worse is because she got kicked off of the plane because she was too big and needed to purchase two seats. She was excellent throughout the entire film and her journey along the way is one of the best in the film. Her scumbag husband is played brilliantly by Richard Jones and he plays the part of the horrible cheating husband great. This dude you will truly be mad at while watching this film as will you be at his ""girlfriend"" who is wife's friend Trina who is played wonderfully by Denise Boutte. Then there is the local sheriff Troy who helps Shelia along and eventually becomes more then a friend to her, he is played wonderfully by Lamman Rucker.Then of course you have Tyler Perry himself in the role of Terry who is just a guy looking to have another kid but his career driven wife won't even show up for his birthday let alone have another child. Perry gives a wonderful performance in this film and seems like the every man. His wife is played by Sharon Leal who does a wonderful job in this as the over worked and over committed to her job Diane. Then of course there is the couple of Patricia and Gavin who on the outside seem like the perfect couple. Of course that is not the case since they lost their only child in a car accident Patricia was involved in. Janet Jackson who makes her return to film in this does a great job as Patricia who is the other girls rock but really can't even forgive herself about the kid. And Malik Yoba is great as her husband who it turns out has yet to truly forgive her as well, he hates that they act like it didn't happen.Then of course there is one of the most entertaining couples in the movie Angela and Marcus, talk about problems. Angela is a strong woman who at the same time can't get over her own insecurities particularly about her husbands ex. Tasha Smith was perfect for the role and did a great job with the character, and Michael Jai White as her husband was absolutely one of the funniest people in the entire movie. Both of them give great performances and make the film even better.This is a wonderful movie full of great and real life characters that I am sure most can relate to. Plus you have to love the 80/20 rule they discuss in her, what a great way to some up how people feel about cheating and what you are doing. Tyler Perry did a wonderful job with this film and I can't wait to see more from him in the future.

1129260,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B001132GNY,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[32, 35]","My husband and I enjoyed this film very much and we both agreed that Perry done a great job with this film. Though he continues to put out films with an obvious ""stagey"" feel to them that don't work as well as they should even though they do work better than one would expect. In his second feature film without the Madea character, Perry again brings one of his stage plays to the big screen with ""Why Did I Get Married,"" a film that works because of the heart and soul of the cast even when it feels like Perry's over-the-top preachiness is about to cave everything in. The film centers around four couples who gather each year at a Rocky Mountain retreat for your basic ""save our marriage"" therapeutic weekend. Being a Perry production, the weekend will be filled with lots of laughs, lots of tears, lots of revelations, a few heartbreaks and a solid Christian center that without the preachiness that often accompanies such a central core.Janet Jackson leads the cast as the relationship expert who guides the weekend supported by her husband (Malik Yoba). There's a power couple (Tyler Perry and Sharon Leal), a drinkin'/fightin' couple (Michael Jai White and Tasha Smith), and an obviously abusive couple (Jill Scott and Richard T. Jones). Before the weekend is over, in typical Perry fashion, secrets will be revealed and lives will be changed for the good and the bad. The ensemble cast is solid throughout, most notably a well-padded Jill Scott as a gentle, sweet woman trying to deal with a cheating hubby, and Tasha Smith, who's blessed with the film's best lines and she nails every one of them.While it's certainly easy to knock Perry's inability to produce anything approaching subtlety, it seems almost pointless to do so. Perhaps because of his lack of subtlety, Perry's films inevitably say things that most of today's filmmakers don't have the balls to say and it's rather refreshing to have a filmmaker actively speak out on issues. The scenes between Jill Scott and Richard T. Jones, for example, are almost achingly painful in their honesty and brought vividly to mind the utter shock of Blair Underwood's domestic abuse scenes in ""Madea's Family Reunion.""Other solid performances are turned in by Janet Jackson and Perry himself, who proves he needn't be dressed in drag to be an accomplished actor. Toyomichi Kurita's cinematography is solid given the film's inherent staged feeling and that all of Perry's films continue to be modestly budgeted productions. Aaron Zigman's original music complements the scenes nicely, and, while the production design doesn't quite tear us away from the staged feeling, it nonetheless fits the proceedings well.Tyler Perry doesn't really need film critics. While his first turn away from Madea, ""Daddy's Little Girls,"" was a box-office disappointment, Perry's modestly budgeted films continue to successfully reach Perry's targeted urban markets and, with a typical box-office in the $50 million range, Perry's future as a filmmaker continues to be on solid ground.",4,"Tired of the ""ghetto fabulous"" antics that are delivered in most movies...this should do the trick.",1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,3023,"['husband', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'agreed', 'Perry', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'put', 'out', 'films', 'obvious', 'stagey', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'even', 'do', 'work', 'better', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'Madea', 'character', 'Perry', 'again', 'one', 'stage', 'big', 'screen', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'film', 'heart', 'soul', 'cast', 'even', 'when', 'Perry', 'over-the-top', 'preachiness', 'cave', 'everything', 'film', 'centers', 'four', 'couples', 'who', 'gather', 'year', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'retreat', 'basic', 'save', 'marriage', 'therapeutic', 'weekend', 'Being', 'Perry', 'production', 'weekend', 'will', 'be', 'filled', 'lots', 'laughs', 'lots', 'tears', 'lots', 'revelations', 'few', 'heartbreaks', 'solid', 'Christian', 'center', 'preachiness', 'often', 'central', 'core.Janet', 'Jackson', 'cast', 'relationship', 'expert', 'who', 'weekend', 'supported', 'husband', 'Malik', 'Yoba', 'power', 'couple', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Sharon', 'Leal', ""drinkin'/fightin"", 'couple', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'Tasha', 'Smith', 'obviously', 'abusive', 'couple', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'Richard', 'T.', 'Jones', 'weekend', 'over', 'typical', 'Perry', 'fashion', 'secrets', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'changed', 'good', 'bad', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'solid', 'most', 'notably', 'well-padded', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'gentle', 'sweet', 'woman', 'trying', 'deal', 'cheating', 'hubby', 'Tasha', 'Smith', 'who', 'blessed', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'one', 'them.While', 'certainly', 'easy', 'knock', 'Perry', 'inability', 'produce', 'anything', 'approaching', 'subtlety', 'almost', 'pointless', 'do', 'so', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'Perry', 'films', 'inevitably', 'say', 'things', 'most', 'today', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'balls', 'say', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'have', 'filmmaker', 'actively', 'out', 'issues', 'scenes', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'Richard', 'T.', 'Jones', 'example', 'are', 'almost', 'achingly', 'painful', 'honesty', 'brought', 'vividly', 'mind', 'utter', 'shock', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'scenes', 'Madea', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'Other', 'solid', 'performances', 'are', 'turned', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'Perry', 'who', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'dressed', 'drag', 'be', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'Toyomichi', 'Kurita', 'cinematography', 'solid', 'given', 'film', 'inherent', 'staged', 'feeling', 'Perry', 'films', 'continue', 'be', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'productions', 'Aaron', 'Zigman', 'original', 'music', 'scenes', 'nicely', 'production', 'design', ""n't"", 'quite', 'tear', 'away', 'staged', 'feeling', 'nonetheless', 'proceedings', 'well.Tyler', 'Perry', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'film', 'critics', 'first', 'turn', 'away', 'Madea', 'Daddy', 'Little', 'Girls', 'was', 'box-office', 'disappointment', 'Perry', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'films', 'continue', 'successfully', 'reach', 'Perry', 'targeted', 'urban', 'markets', 'typical', 'box-office', '50', 'million', 'range', 'Perry', 'future', 'filmmaker', 'be', 'solid', 'ground']",N/A

They're friends from college and everyone is successful, though of course unhappy for different reasons. At least one couple is struggling with male infidelity. A second cannot communicate the pain of the unexpected death of their son. There is a busy litigator unable to make time for her doctor-husband. Writer-director Tyler Perry's underlying theme is that in spite of material wealth and success, keeping a marriage healthy remains a constant challenge.There are not as many laughs in this as in other Tyler Perry films, but the emotion is very real and the writing strong. It's difficult to take much of Janet Jackson because her speaking voice does not lend itself to the screen. The first half of the film is superior to the second, which covers the time after the couples leave their vacation retreat in the mountains. Women will loveTyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married?

I truly enjoyed it.It is a story blending four married couples who each have their problems.  They go away on a couples weekend in the mountains and various senarios take place.  It was good to see a plus-sized character in here (Jill Scott who played Sheila), but the verbal and emotional abuse she took from her husband was extreme.  He was an outright pig of a man (although he's cute and played very well by Richard T Jones) who bought to this couples weekend, his 'bit on the side'.  During the course of a dinner one night, accusations go flying about each of the couples relationships or infidelities etc and it gets pretty ugly.  There are break ups and make ups and it is done really well.  I thought one of the best actors in this movie was actually Janet Jackson.  I thought she was very very good in here and I thought Jill Scott was only average.  She isn't the best of actresses, yet she did make us really feel for her and her issues with her husband and her weight.Yes the movie is a little long, but it is very enjoyable and overall it's well acted out and interesting and a new favourite of mine.

At best this is a Lifetime movie gone wrong. At its worst its a huge embarrassment for Jill Scott and Janet Jackson, both of whom belong in better films than this one. Also, it proved once and for all that Janet's only career-defining move on screen has been in ""Poetic Justice"" - but that was fifteen years ago.Four unhappily married couples shack up in a hilly cabin for a weekend, and all of their usual marital issues come to the fore. On paper this looks remotely interesting, but the idea here is far more entertaining than the execution. What is worse is the sloppy acting and very amateurish direction. Janet Jackson, in her most poorly advised role of all time, sleepwalks through her wholly unbelievable role of a 40+ woman who suffers guilt pangs because she inadvertently 'killed' her young son. The scenes where she is supposedly an award winning author of repute are especially irritating because watching Janet wear safari suits and addressing college audiences about her Ph.D and achievements were far too ridiculous to watch. Seriously, nothing here worked.We have the token 'fat woman', here played by Jill Scott, who reduces her character to a salivating blob of uselessness, which is probably a good thing because there was nothing here for her to work with. She takes abuse after abuse from her husband, who I think definitely had his head screwed on right. Who wants to be with these neurotic women who scream and yell and throw tantrums every other second? One woman here has her 'tubes tied' to avoid getting pregnant again, and so is reluctant to have sex, and instead becomes this beeyotch with attitude. None of this is interesting.I find it weird that the African-American film genre, which gave us so many wonderful films in the 1990s, gives us such useless fare in the 2000s. Between this and the disgusting 'Norbit', I would choose 'Norbit' anyday because at least it doesn't pretend to be something intellectual and philosophical.

However, there are moments in his movies where the goings-ons seem a bit too far-fetched or too sappy/mushy.  When considering the casting, cinematography, and story line, this is easily one of his best films.  He gives Madea a rest and we are enabled to see him play a serious role, and have a leading role.  My favorite entertainer, Janet Jackson, stars in it, so I can write a very accurate synopsis of this film because I've seen it a number of times (smile).We are introduced to four married couples, all with problems, some apparent and some harbored.  Sheila and Mike, Diane and Terry, Angela and Marcus, and Patricia and Gavin.  Mike isn't physically attracted to Sheila anymore, so he decides to date her friend, right before her eyes.  Sheila and Mike are supposed to be traveling to meet their friends at a resort, but he tells her she has to drive at the last minute.  As the film progresses, we feel and see Sheila's pain.  Jill Scott did a marvelous job; she had the folks in the theatre cheering for her.  Diane and Terry are at odds about many things; having children and schedule conflicts being chief among their marital issues.  Marcus and Angela are easily the most entertaining couple of the bunch.  Angela cannot seem to stay sober and her husband despises her behavior as a drunk.  Also, he has children by another woman and, of course, that causes strain on their relationship.  Gavin and Patricia have the best relationship of the bunch, or so it seems.  As the film progresses, they endure their share of hardships that were previously unmentioned.  There is a lot of comedy in this movie, but also many serious issues are addressed.This movie is a bit lengthy, but you most likely won't have a problem watching it all the way through, especially those seeing it for the first time.

When they are absent of Medea, his signature character, you often times find yourself wanting of something else because she is the center of his as well as the fictional characters' world.  Here we have a group of eight friends (four couples) who meet every year for a get together in a cabin to have all their dirty laundry air out.Some if it is a little too far fetched to be believed, but I guess anything and everything can happen in this day and age.  Sheila actually endures the humiliation of having her pig of a husband not just have her thrown off the plane because she's too fat to fit in the seats, but brings his lover with him in her place only to have her be in complete denial why she is even in attendence at the cabin.  One lush of a wife is screaming at her husband that the boughts of VD are not due to his infidelity but hers.  Another couple is arguing about having children or not, about having sex or lack of, what the kids are doing with his baby's mama, etc.  Funny how when you have a bunch of people cooped up in a house for a long time everything just comes out, and there is little alcohol mixed in save for the one with the obvious problem.There is the typical rather predicable message of spirituality and resolving the obvious problems here, nothing will come as a major surprise.

This movie centers on their marriages, all of which have some major form of strife.  Some of this strife stems from poor past choices, some from deep-seated character flaws, and some from past tragedy.  Eventually these elements all converge, finally colliding head-on, forcing them to re-evaluate their marriages and their friendships.I found most of the characters likeable, and I think that pretty much anyone will be able to identify with at least one, possibly several of the main characters.  In a very short time, I cared what happened to them.  Even the character who saw herself as an ugly duckling, (a self-image wrought mainly by media images of thinness and beauty,) was a warm and wonderful character whose beauty shone throughout the entire picture.The scenery and settings are awesome in scope, rich, warm and beautiful in detail.  I WANT to know who their decorators are!!!  These elements combine to present a very visually pleasing movie.There aren't enough movies or other media attention on the sanctity of marriage.  This movie makes a fine portrayal of the beauty and worth of marriage.  It shows marriage as something worth fighting for and devoting work towards.I am grateful for Tyler Perry and applaud his success.  This man not only lives, but also helps DEFINE the American Dream--and he does it by producing Faith and Values-based movies that exhibit Christian themes of perseverance, forgiveness, etc.  Furthermore Perry's movies on the whole promote purity in sexual mores, something disastrously deficient in most of the drivel Hollywood trowels out.  Even though some of Perry's characters don't practice purity, these are almost universally portrayed as reprehensible, and their behavior is uniformly reprobated.  In the end, the evildoers in his plays and movies are usually shown as obviously not being happy with the lives that the backlash of their selfish and pleasure-based choices has created.I wholeheartedly wish Hollywood would CATCH ON that there is a sizeable market (not to mention a NEED) for this kind of genre in America and the world!!!Perry's ""Why Did I Get Married"" exhibits the high quality of character, plot and Christian values that I have come to expect from a Tyler Perry movie.",4,For Better or for Worse,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,2329,"['Four', 'couples', 'defined', 'history', 'long', 'friendships', 'intertwine', 'annual', 'retreat', 'movie', 'centers', 'marriages', 'have', 'major', 'form', 'strife', 'strife', 'poor', 'past', 'choices', 'deep-seated', 'character', 'flaws', 'past', 'tragedy', 'Eventually', 'elements', 'converge', 'finally', 'colliding', 'head-on', 'forcing', 're-evaluate', 'marriages', 'friendships.I', 'found', 'most', 'characters', 'likeable', 'think', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'least', 'one', 'possibly', 'several', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'Even', 'character', 'who', 'saw', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'self-image', 'wrought', 'mainly', 'media', 'images', 'thinness', 'beauty', 'was', 'warm', 'wonderful', 'character', 'beauty', 'shone', 'entire', 'picture.The', 'scenery', 'settings', 'are', 'awesome', 'scope', 'rich', 'warm', 'beautiful', 'detail', 'WANT', 'know', 'who', 'decorators', 'are', 'elements', 'combine', 'present', 'very', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'movie.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'movies', 'other', 'media', 'attention', 'sanctity', 'marriage', 'movie', 'fine', 'portrayal', 'beauty', 'worth', 'marriage', 'marriage', 'something', 'fighting', 'devoting', 'work', 'towards.I', 'am', 'grateful', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'applaud', 'success', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'DEFINE', 'American', 'Dream', 'producing', 'Faith', 'Values-based', 'movies', 'exhibit', 'Christian', 'themes', 'perseverance', 'forgiveness', 'etc', 'Furthermore', 'Perry', 'movies', 'whole', 'promote', 'purity', 'sexual', 'mores', 'something', 'disastrously', 'deficient', 'most', 'drivel', 'Hollywood', 'trowels', 'out', 'Even', 'Perry', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'practice', 'purity', 'are', 'almost', 'universally', 'portrayed', 'reprehensible', 'behavior', 'uniformly', 'reprobated', 'end', 'evildoers', 'plays', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'shown', 'obviously', 'not', 'being', 'happy', 'lives', 'backlash', 'selfish', 'pleasure-based', 'choices', 'created.I', 'wholeheartedly', 'wish', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'CATCH', 'ON', 'sizeable', 'market', 'not', 'mention', 'NEED', 'kind', 'genre', 'America', 'world', 'Perry', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'high', 'quality', 'character', 'plot', 'Christian', 'values', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movie']",N/A

Jones) as the prototypical ""End of the Road"" couple.  Mike is boldly stepping out on his self-loathing wifey whom he treats with absolute disrespect and contempt, reducing their concept of love & marriage to nothing more than the sharing of a house and last names.Instant Classic film you'll have to watch to find out which couples ""make it"" and which ""don't.""Note: Tyler Perry's films are famous for solidly Christian values, concepts of redemption and forgiveness and the portrayal of each character as multi-dimensional and complex enough so as not to easily be labeled ""good guy/bad guy.""

She has not performed any better than the others.The all-Black characters of high education and gainful employment are encouraging role models in many ways for the Black and other youth who may be finding it hard to realize their own dreams of prosperity.The characters have their own personal problems that make them human, but they somehow manage to deal with them all in one weekend and make decisions for the future.
