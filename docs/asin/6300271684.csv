Simon,"[3, 3]","A group of scientists from various disciplines are assembled in a think tank with an unlimited budget in order to solve the world's problems, like pollution, overpopulation, war, famine, poverty, etc. They get bored with those subjects and move on to more whimsical, fun, projects wherein the manipulate society in perverse means. One day, when reading an article in a newspaper, they read that most people believe that there is extraterrestrial life, so they decide to give the public what it wants.Alan Arkin plays Simon, an underfunded, ignored, neurotic psychologist at a university who is absolutely desperate for recognition, funding, and a breakthrough. The think tank staff choose him and recruit him as supposedly one of them, an unappreciated genius. In truth, he is going to be their guinea pig. They brainwash him to think that he is an ET and they also alter his biochemistry to make the claim more believable, whereupon they announce their findings to the world. At this point, he starts to make proclamations on how society should change for the better. At this point, I won't give any more of the plot.The weird, understated score attached to the institute is great for establishing the mood of the film.",5,A rare satirical gem,1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,1220,"['group', 'scientists', 'various', 'disciplines', 'are', 'assembled', 'think', 'tank', 'unlimited', 'budget', 'order', 'solve', 'world', 'problems', 'pollution', 'overpopulation', 'war', 'famine', 'poverty', 'etc', 'get', 'bored', 'subjects', 'move', 'more', 'whimsical', 'fun', 'projects', 'wherein', 'manipulate', 'society', 'perverse', 'means', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'reading', 'article', 'newspaper', 'read', 'most', 'people', 'believe', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'decide', 'give', 'public', 'what', 'wants.Alan', 'Arkin', 'plays', 'Simon', 'underfunded', 'ignored', 'neurotic', 'psychologist', 'university', 'who', 'absolutely', 'desperate', 'recognition', 'funding', 'breakthrough', 'think', 'tank', 'staff', 'choose', 'recruit', 'supposedly', 'one', 'unappreciated', 'genius', 'truth', 'going', 'be', 'guinea', 'pig', 'brainwash', 'think', 'ET', 'also', 'alter', 'biochemistry', 'make', 'claim', 'more', 'believable', 'announce', 'findings', 'world', 'point', 'make', 'proclamations', 'how', 'society', 'should', 'change', 'better', 'point', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'plot.The', 'weird', 'understated', 'score', 'attached', 'institute', 'great', 'establishing', 'mood', 'film']",N/A

Alan Arkin is priceless in the title role; the shots at American society/culture from the late 70's are sublime. HOWEVER, the disc has NO extras. Since when is closed captioning an extra?  Newsflash to the manufacturers of this disc: Closed captioning is essential not just because there is an aging population who cannot hear as well as in earlier years, but also because sound gets muddled sometimes , or dialog is underspoken.  Pity, the transfer to disc is clean and precise but leaving out the CC is a two star error.

238389,A3GXPVF1WGCZMK,6300271684,"Matt Harnick ""Discworld Junkie""","[4, 4]","I remember 'Simon' fondly for two reasons. First, it was simply a wonderful comedy with a deeper message. Second, I knew many people in the cast personally. For example, the head of the Church of Television was played by Adolf Green who lived in the same elevator line in the building where I grew up. And this is the same man who co-wrote 'Singin' In The Rain'. Everyone of a certain age remembers Judi Grobart from 'The Electric Company'. Among other characters, she was Jennifer of the Jungle (""OYOYOYOYOYOYO!).The film itself is about a man named Simon who is doing sensory deprivation research. An exclusive think-tank of the four most brilliant minds in the world invite him to become one of them, but with a sinister motive. They leave him in the tank for a full week and he emerges with a mind regressed to that of ""a bacterium"". Alan Arkin re[evolving to the human level is one of the funniest sequences ever filmed. While his mind is still maleable, the think-tank members brainwash Simon into believing that he is actually the child of extraterrestrial parents who are machines. After waking up from hypnosis, Simon tearfully declares ""I'm a toaster!!"". Simon is then used to start a kind of peace movement which gets way out of hand. His wife eventually breaks him out and things get really interesting. There is so much more to this film but I don't want to ruin it for you. The last thing I will say is Austin Pendleton stroking a computer shaped like a gigantic Princess phone with a sexy voice.It has been a real disappointment to me that this film has yet to be released on DVD. Maybe if we all ask nicely? Or do we have to imitate Simon doing an impression of a jungle cat? Either way, this gem really ought to be transferred.

238390,A1QNYLBG73QRNF,6300271684,"Neurasthenic ""neurasthenic""","[0, 0]","I think this film never got the good notices it deserved when it was initially released. Perhaps it suffered from being Marshall Brickman's followup toAnnie HallandManhattan, almost nothing could have lived up to the expectations created by those films. Regardless, it's a sweet and funny little film. Alan Arkin and Austen Pendleton are particularly good in their performances. Much of the humor comes from mocking the media, and despite the huge changes in television and print media since this movie was released in 1980, this all holds up pretty well. There's also an extended sequence that mocks the trend of experimenting with sensory-deprivation tanks, which works even now that such devices are far from the mainstream.There's a bit of sexually explicit material involving Madeline Kahn; other than that, you could show the movie to a child. To Brickman's credit, unlike a lot of comedies from this era, Simon never tries to squeeze laughs out of mocking ethnic minorities, foreigners or homosexuals.The end of the film doesn't make much sense, but it doesn't really matter, as a whole the movie is clearly a success.",4,This film has gotten a raw deal; it's definitely better than its popular reputation,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,1125,"['think', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'good', 'notices', 'deserved', 'when', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'Perhaps', 'suffered', 'being', 'Marshall', 'Brickman', 'followup', 'toAnnie', 'HallandManhattan', 'almost', 'nothing', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'created', 'films', 'Regardless', 'sweet', 'funny', 'little', 'film', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Austen', 'Pendleton', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'performances', 'Much', 'humor', 'mocking', 'media', 'huge', 'changes', 'television', 'print', 'media', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1980', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'also', 'extended', 'sequence', 'trend', 'experimenting', 'sensory-deprivation', 'tanks', 'even', 'now', 'such', 'devices', 'are', 'far', 'mainstream.There', 'bit', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'material', 'involving', 'Madeline', 'Kahn', 'other', 'could', 'show', 'movie', 'child', 'Brickman', 'credit', 'lot', 'comedies', 'era', 'Simon', 'never', 'squeeze', 'mocking', 'ethnic', 'minorities', 'foreigners', 'homosexuals.The', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'whole', 'movie', 'clearly', 'success']",N/A
