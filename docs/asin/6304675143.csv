430844,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6304675143,Chrijeff,"[4, 4]","A well-paced comic fantasy starring frequent Disney stalwart Fred MacMurray, this is the original from which Robin Williams, 36 years later, made ""Flubber.""  MacMurray plays Ned Brainerd, a chemistry professor at little Medfield College, who has his head so far up in the clouds that he's managed to twice miss his wedding to Betsy Carlisle (Nancy Olson), secretary to college president Rufus Daggett (Leon Ames).  On the very night when the third attempt is scheduled, an explosion in Ned's improvised garage lab results in the discovery of a gooey dark substance he names ""flubber""--a ""metastable compound"" that ""creates its own energy"" when bounced off a hard surface or bombarded with gamma rays.  Thrilled by his breakthrough, Ned scarcely realizes he's missed the ceremony again, but once he does, he sets out to get back into Betsy's good graces, defeat his rival for her hand (Prof. Shelby Ashton of long-time rival school Rutland, played by Elliott Reed, who took a similar role as Ralph Hastings in MacMurray's ""Follow Me, Boys"" five years later), and ultimately save the college from small-time tycoon Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn), a blustering local loan king and descendant of the town's founders who has loaned half a million dollars to the college and is pressing for repayment.  Along the way he arranges the spectacular basketball victory of Medfield over Rutland, terrorizes Ashton by bouncing his modified (flying) Model T Ford off the roof of his rival's car (the ""Shelby Stomp,"" as he christens it), and has to rescue his Lizzie from Hawk's warehouse after it's switched for a nonmodified version.The special effects in this movie, while inevitably nowhere near the caliber of what became possible even 15 years later, are among its high points, and certainly very well done for the time.  MacMurray is up to his usual standard as the quiet hero with principles who stands up for what he believes and is ready to fight for his rights.  There's also an abundance of laugh-worthy moments, from the quick shots of Ned's bemused little dog Charlie reacting to the first usages of flubber, through the wonderfully comic maneuvers of the basketball game and Ned's handling of Hawk's two goons in the warehouse, to the skillfully intercut scenes in and high above Washington, D.C., when Ned and Betsy fly the car there to offer it to the government and find themselves the target of the capital's defenses.  (I can't help wondering why, if the picture drawn in the movie is accurate, Al Qaeda was able to fly a jet into the Pentagon 40 years later without having it shot down before it got within five miles of the place.)  In the end, of course, the right triumphs, and Ned and Betsy even manage to have their long-delayed wedding.  Comic without being overwhelmingly slapsticky (a bow to nostalgia is provided by the appearance of Wynn's father Ed in a video adaptation of his famous Fire Chief role), the film can also serve as a good jumping-off point for family discussions, like what we owe to our country and how to handle unscrupulous people like Hawk.",5,Flubber rules!,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,3071,"['well-paced', 'comic', 'fantasy', 'starring', 'frequent', 'Disney', 'stalwart', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'original', 'Robin', 'Williams', '36', 'years', 'later', 'made', 'Flubber', 'MacMurray', 'plays', 'Ned', 'Brainerd', 'chemistry', 'professor', 'little', 'Medfield', 'College', 'who', 'head', 'so', 'far', 'up', 'clouds', 'managed', 'twice', 'miss', 'wedding', 'Betsy', 'Carlisle', 'Nancy', 'Olson', 'secretary', 'college', 'president', 'Rufus', 'Daggett', 'Leon', 'Ames', 'very', 'night', 'when', 'third', 'attempt', 'scheduled', 'explosion', 'Ned', 'improvised', 'garage', 'lab', 'results', 'discovery', 'gooey', 'dark', 'substance', 'flubber', 'metastable', 'compound', 'own', 'energy', 'when', 'bounced', 'off', 'hard', 'surface', 'bombarded', 'gamma', 'rays', 'Thrilled', 'breakthrough', 'Ned', 'scarcely', 'missed', 'ceremony', 'again', 'once', 'out', 'get', 'back', 'Betsy', 'good', 'graces', 'defeat', 'rival', 'hand', 'Prof.', 'Shelby', 'Ashton', 'long-time', 'rival', 'school', 'Rutland', 'played', 'Elliott', 'Reed', 'who', 'took', 'similar', 'role', 'Ralph', 'Hastings', 'MacMurray', 'Follow', 'Me', 'Boys', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'ultimately', 'save', 'college', 'small-time', 'tycoon', 'Alonzo', 'Hawk', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'blustering', 'local', 'loan', 'king', 'descendant', 'town', 'founders', 'who', 'loaned', 'million', 'dollars', 'college', 'pressing', 'repayment', 'way', 'spectacular', 'basketball', 'victory', 'Medfield', 'Rutland', 'Ashton', 'bouncing', 'modified', 'flying', 'Model', 'T', 'Ford', 'roof', 'rival', 'car', 'Shelby', 'Stomp', 'rescue', 'Lizzie', 'Hawk', 'warehouse', 'switched', 'nonmodified', 'version.The', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'inevitably', 'nowhere', 'caliber', 'what', 'became', 'possible', 'even', '15', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'high', 'points', 'certainly', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'time', 'MacMurray', 'up', 'usual', 'standard', 'quiet', 'hero', 'principles', 'who', 'up', 'what', 'ready', 'fight', 'rights', 'also', 'abundance', 'laugh-worthy', 'moments', 'quick', 'shots', 'Ned', 'bemused', 'little', 'dog', 'Charlie', 'reacting', 'first', 'usages', 'flubber', 'wonderfully', 'comic', 'maneuvers', 'basketball', 'game', 'Ned', 'handling', 'Hawk', 'two', 'goons', 'warehouse', 'skillfully', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'high', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'when', 'Ned', 'Betsy', 'fly', 'car', 'there', 'offer', 'government', 'find', 'target', 'capital', 'defenses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'why', 'picture', 'drawn', 'movie', 'accurate', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'was', 'able', 'fly', 'jet', 'Pentagon', '40', 'years', 'later', 'having', 'shot', 'down', 'got', 'five', 'miles', 'place', 'end', 'course', 'right', 'triumphs', 'Ned', 'Betsy', 'even', 'manage', 'have', 'long-delayed', 'wedding', 'Comic', 'being', 'overwhelmingly', 'slapsticky', 'bow', 'nostalgia', 'provided', 'appearance', 'Wynn', 'father', 'Ed', 'video', 'adaptation', 'famous', 'Fire', 'Chief', 'role', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'serve', 'good', 'jumping-off', 'point', 'family', 'discussions', 'what', 'owe', 'country', 'how', 'handle', 'unscrupulous', 'people', 'Hawk']",The Absent-Minded Professor Colorized  VHS

The movie is simply infectious and has humor for all ages.The story is chock-full and has many veins and sub-plots, which add to the fun. Basically, the story revolves around the main character, the ""Absentminded Professor"" himself, Dr. Brainard following the time around his wedding (the third time staged, as he ""forgot"" to go to the first two...I wonder what the outlook is for the third time?), and his unexpected discovery of a metastable compound he dubs, ""flying rubber"", or ""Flubber"".Throughout the movie, we see several stories playing out - the missed wedding, the discovery of Flubber's properties, Dr. Brainard's attempt to win back his love, and the effort to keep Medfield College afloat financially.  Add to that, the run-ins with the police, and the way Dr. Brainard helps Medfield College win an important basketball game, and you've got yourself a winning ticket.Overall, this is film is great fun with really timeless humor.

A new and improved version of the DVD has been released that is in original black and white and is in widescreen (this is the one I recommend), but Amazon posted the reviews of the first DVD onto the new one as well. Are you confused yet?  The black & white version has been re-mastered and has a cleaner image, but unfortunately is still without extras. Not even some outtakes, gallery stuff, theatrical trailers, or cartoons? It is still a terrific movie...THE STORY:  live action comedy/fantasy. Professor Brainard (played to perfection by Fred MacMurray) is a forgetful scientist who is so absorbed in his work that he ignores his personal life, much to the chagrin of his girlfriend Betsy (Nancy Olson). So involved in fact that he cannot even remember to show up for his own wedding, and he loses his girl to a rival suitor. But that day he causes a mishap in the lab that accidentally creates a new anti-gravity substance that is basically floating rubber. He tries to convince his girl he has this new miracle, but she thinks he is a crackpot at this point. He tries to impress her by using his invention to help the feeble college basketball team finally win a big game, but she gets madder at his attempt to get credit for it.  He then tries to convince the Defense Department that the substance works, but something seems to go wrong with the tests. For example he rigs his ""Model T"" car to fly, but someone switches cars unbeknown to him and he looks like a lunatic claiming his car can fly. The scenes of the various armed forces commanders trying to outmaneuver each other are rich. The professor is then pursued by criminal boss Alonzo Hawk and his thugs, seemingly the only one who believes he has the substance and wants it for himself. Great satire on college administration, the military, and other institutions, this movie has hilarious antics, crazy stunts, and it is good clean fun for kids and adults.BEHIND THE SCENES AND TRIVIA: The role of Alonzo Hawk is played by Keenan Wynn, who reprises the role of Hawk for the sequel ""Son of Flubber"" and again in ""Herbie Rides Again."" Also stars Tommy Kirk as Hawks college son, Ed Wynn as the fire chief. You may not recognize the TV newsman, but millions of visitors to Disneyland did, as he was played by Wally Boag who performed daily at Disneyland's Golden Horseshoe Review. The films special effects were nominated for an Academy Award. Disney brought in a science professor to help them design the flubber substance and make the science in the movie more authentic. Produced by Bill Walsh, who also worked on ""The Shaggy Dog"". Walsh also wrote the screenplay and pushed the studio and the director to do the aerial basketball game, that really make the film. The story originated from three short stories by Samuel Taylor that Walt Disney had purchased from Liberty Magazine during the war. Directed by Robert Stevenson, the movie was originally released to theaters in March 16, 1961, one of the biggest box office years for the Disney Studio. The same year saw release of ""The Parent Trap"", and ""Swiss Family Robinson"". All three films were in the top ten grossing films of the industry for the year. The movie returned to theaters in '67 and '74, something unheard of today. The movie was televised as a special on November 11, 1975 and it later aired in two parts on NBC's ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" on September 9 and 16, 1979. The story was adapted to a made for television series in 1988, but only two episodes were ever aired. The sequel to the movie was equally popular in the box office, and utilized most of the same actors and production team. The original movie was released on video for the first time in 1981. It was colorized after an airing on the Disney Channel in 1986. A theatrical version of the original story was remade starring Robin Williams in ""Flubber"" was released on November 26, 1997.  The song in the opening credits is known as the ""Medfield Fight Song"" and was written by the Sherman Brothers in their first feature film screen credit. The background music score was written by Disney Studio composer George Bruns.

Four stars as a film, but five stars for being a classic.The &quot;science-fiction comedy&quot; is a movie genre with few entries. (I'm thinking of films in which an SF premise and its development is the film's focal point. &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; for example, doesn't count.) I can think of only two significant others -- &quot;It Happens Every Spring,&quot; in which Ray Milland synthesizes a chemical that repels wood (don't ask), and &quot;The Man in the White Suit,&quot; the classic-but-not-really-very-good Alec Guinness vehicle in which his invention of an indestructible, never-needs-cleaning fabric threatens to ruin the clothing industry.Disney continued the genre with &quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot; and &quot;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,&quot; but none of them is remotely as good as &quot;The Absent Minded Professor.&quot; It's a classic of visual humor. Not only is there the famous flying Model T, but the professor's attempts to woo his ex-fiance by dancing in flubber-heeled shoes, and a flubber-enhanced basketball game that's an encylopaedia of &quot;What can you do with flying basketball players?&quot; gags. Style-wise, this classic sequence looks as if it were lifted directly from MAD.Bill Walsh's smart script has some good satirical jabs (&quot;I hear Medfield's athletes make as much as their teachers&quot;) and they hold up. One of the best anticipates Congress's destruction in &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; And the professor's attempt to prove he's a loyal, patriotic American cuts even more sharply today than it did 40+ years ago.One of the few good things about Disney comedies is that almost all the secondary roles are populated with talented character actors -- Keenan Wynn (who'd repeat his Alonzo Hawk villain in other Disney flicks), Ed Wynn (his father), Elliott Reid (at his greasy, pompous best). Special kudos go to Belle Montrose (Steve Allen's mother! -- note the resemblance) as the professor's housekeeper.Nancy Olson -- an Oscar-winner for &quot;Sunset Blvd.&quot; -- delivers a smart, heads-up performance that falls apart only when she stops being mad at Fred MacMurry and becomes a bit of a bubble-head.Robert Stevenson (grandson of Robert Louis Stevenson) had a directorial career (&quot;Jane Eyre&quot;) before he became a Disney house director, but I've never thought much of his talent (&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is slack and sluggish). &quot;The Absent Minded Professor&quot; shows him at his best -- brisk and light, almost as weightless as flubber renders the Model T.&quot;The Absent Minded Professor&quot; was shot in B&amp;W, because the special effects were too difficult (and too expensive) to do well in color. Had Disney known what a major hit TAMP would be (it played first-run for months), he might have sprung for color. The previous attempt to colorize it was a disaster.We finally have this little gem in its original form -- an exquisite B&amp;W enhanced-widescreen transfer. (Amazon editor -- please have the negative reviews for the awful colorized version moved or removed. These are fundamentally different releases.) The rich blacks and sharp detail are outstanding -- far superior to even the old LV release.
