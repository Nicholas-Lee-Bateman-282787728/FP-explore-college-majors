I think it's similar to the HBO series &#34;Girls&#34;, but funnier. The Brits come up with some funny stuff and usually more daring than the USA does. These ladies will crack you up. After season 1, season 2 is a must! The ONLY BAD thing is there is only 6 episodes per season. I didn't want these two seasons to end, but the Brits think it's better to give you quality entertainment rather than quantity that lacks luster with time. I personally wish someone in the USA could take-off on a series like this (like I said with Girls maybe) like the &#34;Office&#34; did and keep it going. Season 2 is just as funny and I'll bet you fall in love with these ladies just as I did.

1227428,A21YJPHV31QQ92,B001PMRBMC,Mr. J. Murdock,"[2, 2]","An absolutely fresh, genuine, and funny sitcom which centers around the lives of three women who are best friends and flatmates. Pulling, although an original sitcom, is an acquired taste and it is one of those shows whose episodes you would have to watch again and again to appreciate the humor and tidbits of great acting exuded by these three stars. The pilot centers on Donna's engagement to her long-time fiancee Karl. Although they have been engaged for three years, Donna is having second thoughts about marrying him. At the last minute, she calls off the wedding and moves in with her friends Louise and Karen.Tanya Franks was perfect in her portrayal as Karen, the unqualified kindergarten teacher who boozes too much and has one-night stand too many. Her abusive tirade at the dry cleaner's left me grimacing in embarrassment! Horgan did a fantastic job both with the humor (what other series can you find Hitler jokes funny?) and with in-depth psychological portrayals of each of these characters. A dark comedy which shows the realistic side of human nature yet, while you're watching it, can't help but mutter to yourself that these characters hit too close to home because these characters are us.

You'll lough so hard you're bound to choke on something or pull a muscle, so be careful. If you're NOT accustomed to watching british TV, you might be having hard time understanding the language, but if you watched Shameless (uk version) IT crowd,  The Office and their likes and loved it, you are guaranteed to be hooked. That's not to say first timers  should  be discouraged.  Watch how Donna, the main character, breaks up with her Fiancee during episode 1. If you're in need of medical help at that moment it's a good sign.The show follows the lives of 3 friends, all single women in their 30, as they bundle through life, career, dating, love and sex. Sounds a bit like &#34;Sex and the city&#34;, right? Well, Wrong. This is not a show about Manolo shoes or glamorous parties. It's not about gloss and fashion and reading Cosmo, it's about being single and young and not knowing quite what to do with it, and making all the possible mistakes, with the most hilarious results. There's such raw, crazy thirst for life, love, sex and Booze. Oh, so much booze. and sex. and booze. And havoc.Donna, Tanya and Louise are real, lovable and extremely funny. Though they are all flawed in their own way and super dysfunctional, you cannot help but falling in love with them and hope that somewhere there's a happily ever after for them.Another big plus of watching this show is that you WILL NOT feel discouraged with your own love life/career/house/money/body after watching this.
