Rumor has it that those involved would only do the third installment if the evil king received his come-uppance, and he does here, in an unsatisfactory manner, unbefitting the evil he once wrought.  It's hard to imagine that a grown man who fed rat poison to an inconvenient party functionary, threw a lover off the top of the House of Commons, and car bombed up another in front of her husband, would be tortured for a second by having killed a boy in (Cyprus civil) wartime. The motive force in this one strains credulity.  Watch and enjoy the first two, but skip this one- it really does not conclude the career of F.U. as the same imagination that brought the first two installments to life would have,",2,A Terrible Disappointment,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,815,"['Especially', 'comparison', 'brilliance', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'was', 'bitter', 'disappointment', 'Rumor', 'involved', 'would', 'only', 'do', 'third', 'installment', 'evil', 'king', 'received', 'come-uppance', 'here', 'unsatisfactory', 'manner', 'unbefitting', 'evil', 'once', 'wrought', 'hard', 'imagine', 'grown', 'man', 'who', 'fed', 'rat', 'poison', 'inconvenient', 'party', 'functionary', 'threw', 'lover', 'top', 'House', 'Commons', 'car', 'bombed', 'up', 'front', 'husband', 'would', 'be', 'tortured', 'second', 'having', 'killed', 'boy', 'Cyprus', 'civil', 'wartime', 'motive', 'force', 'one', 'credulity', 'Watch', 'enjoy', 'first', 'two', 'one-', 'really', 'not', 'conclude', 'career', 'F.U', 'same', 'imagination', 'brought', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'life', 'would', 'have']",Final Cut VHS

Never before in Britain have there been streets filled with homeless and desperate people whom Francis percieves as being little more than animals.
