187123,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1572523255,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 17]","This was a sorry, pathetic excuse of a film.  Nothing, from the opening title sequence, to the characters, to even the paper-thin story, was worth redeeming or recognizable as value.  Several reviews have argued the point that perhaps director Scott Silver (of The Mod Squad fame) should have done a bit of research on the life of a male prostitute instead of just allowing David Arquette the freedom of just jumping around and screaming to show the hardships of ""reality"".  I couldn't agree more.  I felt cheated and confused as I watched this elongated 24-hour period erupt chaotically into several convoluted themes and unsecured elements.  There was never a moment in this film to feel for our characters.  There was never a moment in this film for us, the audience members, to feel what living on the streets of LA involved.  There was never a moment in this film for us to see the pain that Arquette or Haas experienced on a daily basis.  Why was there never a moment?  There was never this moment because Silver was too busy using clich&eacute; elements to force us to like Arquette as a character.  Silver continually forced Arquette's empathy and tribulations onto us thinking that seeing a Hollywood actor playing a gruff street urchin would immediately force us to break into tears and bow at the mercy of this flawed character.  How pathetic.What should have unfolded during the course of this film was a chance for us to see the underbelly that LA attempts to hide.  There should have been more hardships aimed toward Arquette that would have developed into sympathetic moments.  A tragic character allows audience members to connect freely, while a forced character, like the one seen in Johns, makes us fall asleep, feel apathetic, and overly pressured.  It nearly seemed that during the course of this film Arquette could have run for Mayor of the homeless if he would have pushed himself a bit further. Arquette's final version of his character reminded me of an annoying politician instead of a homeless person.  He was shaking hands with everyone, becoming a stronger part of the street's culture, whether the street wanted it or not.  Never was it apparent that he was upset with his current living situation.  It was never made apparent that he wanted to escape the life that he had created.  So, when the unstructured ending finally occurred, it boggled my mind.  Arquette, or maybe it was Silver, made his character do things that I believe he would not have done in real life.  John (Arquette's character) would have not fallen asleep as shown in the beginning of the film once he had his birthday money in hand.  John would not have easily thrown his dream into the trash, as stated, but instead worked throughout the film to make it a reality.Silver's inclusion of Donner (Lucas Haas) into the script only brought the story further into the dismal zone.  Donner is a random target.  Silver makes Donner stronger than John and I do not think that is a fair assessment.  Whatever Donner wants, he gets, no matter how that hurts John.  Donner is not the ""good friend"" that we all assume throughout the course of the film.  In fact, I believe that we could have done without this ""friend"" and just watched the course of John in this one day period.  Donner takes John's heart, his dreams, and nearly places him in trouble, and we are to assume that Donner was about to save him from this disappointing life?  I didn't buy it.  Secondly, did anyone else have trouble with the fact that Arquette and Haas were the two worst male prostitutes ever filmed?  Not that I have any experience with male prostitutes, but it felt as if each time either of these two ""professionals"" got into cars with clients, they had quite a ""no"" mentality.  This led to my impression that these two characters were not just weak, mismatched, and underdriven, but also lazy.  Silver successfully created two of the laziest male prostitutes to ever grace the silver screen.  I guess we cannot knock him for completely failing in this film.Finally, I would like to say that Silver had a boatload of opportunity with this film.  The talent (perhaps outside of Arquette) was present on the screen, sadly, they just didn't do anything.  Keith David, Nicky Katt, Terrance Howard, Elliot Gould, and even John C. McGinley kept this film watchable, but with the counterpoints leading back to Arquette it only worsened the overall feeling of the film.  Even these independent heavy-hitters couldn't save this little ditty of a production.  We needed emotion and heartache instead of the suppressed anger we felt when dealing with the stereotypical generalization of these characters.  Silver didn't create an original body of work, but instead took clich&eacute; moments from other cinematic features and called them his own.  Throw in a spaz-tastic lead, and you have what I like to call a little film named Johns.This was not worth the DVD it was printed on.  I normally don't mind general independent films being made to tell a story about the hardships of living in America, but what I do mind is when they cast decent actors and give them horrible parts, or surround them in a horrible story, or just do not allow them to blossom.  Arquette hurt this film by not fully embracing the character or the realism of the life that follows these certain individuals.  Lukas Haas completely embodied this film with his character.  Poorly developed and randomly tangent.  This was a poor film and I do not recommend it to even the novice of cinema fanatics.Grade: * out of *****",1,I am not a prostitute.,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,5560,"['was', 'sorry', 'pathetic',

I work in a clean nice safe office as a computer geek one floor up and one trillion miles away from the horrid depraved street life people like those protrayed in this film call home every day.Is this film a downer I guess maybe it is if you wanted a happy sugar coated hollywood ending.  While I have never been homeless or on the stroll selling myself I have helped people who have known and lived this ugly world 24-7. From my vantage point I see very little about the world of male prostitutes, drugs and street life that is redeeming light and fun which is what this movie shows.  The end of Johns sports a grim operatic quality traggic victory hard won and blood drenched such that it is in my jaded middle classed eyes hardly a victory at all.  On the streets even tiny scraps of joy no matter how hard they are to come by are so very precious and that is the real message of this movie.  Look at this movie and learn to be thankful for your many blessings because some among us honesty do have so very little in life that a pair of Lucky Sneaks can be the only reason to cling to hope. I know enough about life to understand that if  man's hope dies when he lives on the streets his body soon leads him to the grave.",5,"Endlessly Relentlessly Downbeat, BUT Way Too True to be Missed !",1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,2330,"['Granted', 'movie', 'many', 'perils', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'must', 'endure', 'Bad', 'sound', 'horrible', 'lighting', 'little', 'more', 'predictability', 'generally', 'like', 'good', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'Yes', 'utterly', 'downbeat', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'sunshine', 'hope', 'However', 'walking', 'streets', 'big', 'city', 'see', 'clones', 'individuals', 'protrayed', 'film', 'cleaseless', 'never', 'ending', 'parade', 'tired', 'burned', 'out', 'haggered', 'youth', 'stroll', 'hunting', 'next', 'Date', '.You', 'sit', 'eating', 'danish', 'reading', 'morning', 'paper', 'insolated', 'cacoon', 'middle', 'class', 'bliss', 'listen', 'youth', 'talk', 'few', 'booths', 'fast', 'food', 'resturant', 'Go', 'there', 'morning', 'coffee', 'hear', 'how', 'hardened', 'urchins', 'cling', 'clutch', 'tattered', 'pie', 'sky', 'pipe', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'last', 'look', 'arms', 'see', 'evidence', 'losing', 'game', 'play', 'drugs', 'worse', 'eat', 'place', 'often', 'enough', 'soon', 'day', 'when', 'one', 'regulars', 'beaten', 'bloody', 'bandaged', 'lucky', 'having', 'survived', 'date', 'gone', 'wrong', 'work', 'clean', 'nice', 'safe', 'office', 'computer', 'geek', 'one', 'floor', 'up', 'one', 'trillion', 'miles', 'away', 'horrid', 'depraved', 'street', 'life', 'people', 'protrayed', 'film', 'call', 'home', 'day.Is', 'film', 'downer', 'guess', 'maybe', 'wanted', 'happy', 'sugar', 'coated', 'hollywood', 'ending', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'homeless', 'stroll', 'selling', 'have', 'helped', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'lived', 'ugly', 'world', '24-7', 'vantage', 'point', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'world', 'male', 'prostitutes', 'drugs', 'street', 'life', 'redeeming', 'light', 'fun', 'what', 'movie', 'end', 'Johns', 'sports', 'grim', 'operatic', 'quality', 'traggic', 'victory', 'hard', 'won', 'blood', 'drenched', 'such', 'jaded', 'middle', 'classed', 'eyes', 'hardly', 'victory', 'streets', 'even', 'tiny', 'scraps', 'joy', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'are', 'come', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'precious', 'real', 'message', 'movie', 'Look', 'movie', 'learn', 'be', 'thankful', 'many', 'blessings', 'honesty', 'do', 'have', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'life', 'pair', 'Lucky', 'Sneaks', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'cling', 'hope', 'know', 'enough', 'life', 'understand', 'man', 'hope', 'when', 'streets', 'body', 'soon', 'grave']",Johns VHS

187136,A1SPB225CVTRUU,1572523255,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 2]","I was rather surprised that I didn't see this film when it first came out more than ten years ago, because it's on the level of compelling drama as My Own Private Idahol(River Phoenix). Having recently worked with Lukas Haas in The Stillborn(a horror film kind of like The Sixth Sense), I was quite eager to check out what he was like in terms of acting when he was 19 years old. I didn't quite expect to see David Arquette play a hustler, but it's convincing enough because his character is straight and he's ""gay for pay"". I must say that overall, this film is more touching than My Own Private Own Idahol, but it's kind of lower-budget and has a documentary feel to it.Lukas Haas plays Donner, a ranaway/disowned wealthy son of a businessman. He's down and out in L.A. and befriends a more experienced street hustler John,played David Arquette. Donner goes through ""dates"" that John had seen many times before and they share a strong bond dispite their different sexual orientations. Donner eventually considers leaving the street life, but he must save enough money to buy his ticket. John wanted to go with Donner, but his hope for a new life gets jepardized when he got picked up by his last date, a homophobic trucker....I was quite surprised that Arquette was willing to do a lot of sexy scenes like kissing and seductively dancing, and simultated oral sex with other men. Lukas Haas' role is less challenging compared to Arquette, but his performance was still very real. I loved the scene when he got picked up by elderly client and he got smacked until he was nose-bleeding. He had more dramatic and moving moments at the end of the film. I noticed that even Terence Howard Stamp played a supporting role as a gay pimp.",4,A docu-drama style coming of age queer film with memorable performances from Arquette and Haas.,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,1730,"['was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'level', 'compelling', 'drama', 'My', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idahol', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Having', 'recently', 'worked', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'Stillborn', 'horror', 'film', 'kind', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'quite', 'eager', 'check', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'terms', 'acting', 'when', 'was', '19', 'years', 'old', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'expect', 'see', 'David', 'Arquette', 'play', 'hustler', 'convincing', 'enough', 'character', 'straight', 'gay', 'pay', 'must', 'say', 'overall', 'film', 'more', 'touching', 'Own', 'Private', 'Own', 'Idahol', 'kind', 'lower-budget', 'documentary', 'feel', 'it.Lukas', 'Haas', 'plays', 'Donner', 'ranaway/disowned', 'wealthy', 'son', 'businessman', 'down', 'L.A.', 'more', 'experienced', 'street', 'hustler', 'John', 'played', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Donner', 'dates', 'John', 'had', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'share', 'strong', 'bond', 'dispite', 'different', 'sexual', 'orientations', 'Donner', 'eventually', 'leaving', 'street', 'life', 'must', 'save', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'ticket', 'John', 'wanted', 'go', 'Donner', 'hope', 'new', 'life', 'jepardized', 'when', 'got', 'picked', 'up', 'last', 'date', 'homophobic', 'trucker', '.I', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Arquette', 'was', 'willing', 'do', 'lot', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'kissing', 'seductively', 'dancing', 'simultated', 'oral', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'role', 'less', 'challenging', 'compared', 'Arquette', 'performance', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'real', 'loved', 'scene', 'when', 'got', 'picked', 'up', 'elderly', 'client', 'got', 'smacked', 'was', 'nose-bleeding', 'had', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moving', 'moments', 'end', 'film', 'noticed', 'even', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Stamp', 'played', 'supporting', 'role', 'gay', 'pimp']",Johns VHS
