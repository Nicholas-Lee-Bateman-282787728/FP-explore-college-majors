1611553,A32RAMHPZ38XX0,B00AIBZLR8,Lulu Moretti,"[7, 25]","OK. I know everyone loved Amour. I'd put off watching it until last week because I didn't want to see Jean Louis Trintignant at 82 rather than his lovely 36 years in A Man and A Woman. I streamed Amour via Amazon and then had to rewatch the Man&Woman; race scenes to clear my head.All that aside, I have to say I hated Amour for reasons far more important than the loss of physical beauty. It was boring. Interminable. I mean, this is a story about an intelligent woman, a strong woman, a determined woman. And yet, what does she do when, at the advanced age of 82 she has a stroke and begins the long final slide into incontinence and incompetence? She just slides. Did she think she would never die? Or that she would be hit by a bus and that would be that? It appears she did not think at all. And once she has the first warning stroke, does she order in a bottle of Seconal and fifth of gin? No. She does nothing but show some irritation at her increasing limitations.And meanwhile, the ancient husband Jean Louis is rushing around preparing meals and changing her nappies and protecting her from all outside their closely held world. Claustrophobia anyone? This thing grinds on for over 2 hours. I've read many who say it was beautiful. What was beautiful about it?My suggestions for a remake: 1. Cut it to 90 minutes. 2. Give the first hour over to a celebration of their life together, show fabulous music, and parties, and friends. Show joy and devotion. 3. With 30 minutes to go, she has the stroke. Goes to the hospital. Learns the procedure for repair failed. Knows she's on her way out. 4. Finally, for the last ten minutes, we see her still able to mix a drink (the above mentioned combo)and she wheels herself into the grand living room full of friends. Her pupils play the piano for her. She sips her cocktail and, smiling, closes her eyes. No one notices she's gone but the camera.",1,where are we?,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,1897,"['OK', 'know', 'everyone', 'loved', 'Amour', ""'d"", 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'last', 'week', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'Trintignant', '82', 'rather', 'lovely', '36', 'years', 'Man', 'Woman', 'streamed', 'Amour', 'Amazon', 'then', 'had', 'rewatch', 'Man', 'Woman', 'race', 'scenes', 'clear', 'head.All', 'aside', 'have', 'say', 'hated', 'Amour', 'reasons', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'loss', 'physical', 'beauty', 'was', 'boring', 'Interminable', 'mean', 'story', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'strong', 'woman', 'determined', 'woman', 'yet', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'advanced', 'age', '82', 'stroke', 'long', 'final', 'slide', 'incontinence', 'incompetence', 'just', 'slides', 'Did', 'think', 'would', 'never', 'die', 'would', 'be', 'hit', 'bus', 'would', 'be', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'once', 'first', 'warning', 'stroke', 'order', 'bottle', 'Seconal', 'fifth', 'gin', 'No', 'nothing', 'show', 'irritation', 'increasing', 'limitations.And', 'meanwhile', 'ancient', 'husband', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'rushing', 'preparing', 'meals', 'changing', 'nappies', 'protecting', 'closely', 'held', 'world', 'Claustrophobia', 'anyone', 'thing', '2', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'who', 'say', 'was', 'beautiful', 'What', 'was', 'beautiful', 'My', 'suggestions', 'remake', '1', 'Cut', '90', 'minutes', '2', 'Give', 'first', 'hour', 'celebration', 'life', 'together', 'show', 'fabulous', 'music', 'parties', 'friends', 'Show', 'joy', 'devotion', '3', '30', 'minutes', 'go', 'stroke', 'hospital', 'procedure', 'repair', 'failed', 'Knows', 'way', '4', 'Finally', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'see', 'still', 'able', 'mix', 'drink', 'above', 'mentioned', 'combo', 'grand', 'living', 'room', 'full', 'friends', 'pupils', 'play', 'piano', 'cocktail', 'smiling', 'eyes', 'one', 'gone', 'camera']",Amour

Thank God, it wasn't longer than it was. It's a lovely relationship, but doesn't really show the power of their love, which, after all, is right there in the title. Emmanuelle Riva won awards for her performance, probably because she's old, has a fairly good body of film performances, was nude at 86 and puked on herself. Jean-Louis Trintignant has even a more impressive film resume (at least in the US), and carried the entire film. Everything was from his viewpoint. He was wonderful, but not recognized by any critics' groups, even a nomination!You would think a film about old piano teachers would have some music, but there was none besides some lovely Schubert moments.
