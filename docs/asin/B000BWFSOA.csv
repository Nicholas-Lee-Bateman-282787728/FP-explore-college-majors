This film likes to cite how good Wal-Mart is for the economy, based on how much they pay in taxes.  I would argue that the thousands of ""mom & pop"" businesses that have been displaced (destroyed is probably a more accurate word) around the country by a Wal-Mart opening in their town generated an equal amount (if not more, since they don't have an army of lobbyists in Washington looking out for their interests).  I find it highly suspicious that this ""pro"" Wal-Mart documentary was slapped together in time to compete against the excellent ""Wal-Mart: the High Cost of Low Prices"" by Robert Greenwald.

They are able to purchase television sets, clothing, and even groceries.  Some of even become happy employees with bright futures.  It borders on intellectual dishonesty not to declare Wal-Mart to be something of a secular savior to our planet's poor.  Pity those who do not have one of its stores in their area, or at least manufacture products for the company.  Socialists may make false promises---but Wal-Mart delivers.  Government is quite often part of the problem, and not part of the solution.  The free market knows how to get the job done.The Galloway brothers ask questions of a number of scholars who closely study Wal-Mart.  The consensus viewpoint of even moderate liberal academics is that this company does far more good than harm.  Only hard left-wing ideologues persist in describing Wal-Mart as evil.

951872,A38WHB3IPOX3XR,B000BWFSOA,"E. Parkinson ""Film & Book VIP""","[58, 86]","The answer to the title question in the Galloway Brothers new film about Wal-Mart should be obvious to anyone who has ever shopped in one of their stores.  Wal-Mart ""works"" because they offer quality products at ""always low prices.""  Many consumers vote with their pocketbooks, and this fact has quietly helped build Wal-Mart into a retail giant.  The second part of the title, ""Why That Makes Some People Crazy"" is less obvious in this video than in the ""anti-Walmart"" program from Robert Greenwald.  To be fair, it's not reasonable to expect that Wal-Mart or any other major chain is likely to be the nation's leader in every category of benefits and treatment for their employees and suppliers.  Galloway's film does point out some interesting statistics showing that Wal-Mart's wages dramatically outpace most retail chains and that their benefits package ranks among the nation's best.  Unlike the thesis of the Greenwald film (which implies that the Wal-Mart prices are obtained through salary and benefits abuse of their employees), the Galloway's demonstrate how Wal-Mart has reinvented supply and fulfillment efficiencies to dramatically cut the costs of getting goods onto the shelves.  The biggest criticism that Galloway lobs at Wal-Mart is an observation that they have not been ""good at telling their story"" to American consumers, and as such, are susceptible to baseless attacks from special interest groups.  Other major retailers such as Target, K-Mart, Krogers, Best Buys, Sears and many others fulfill consumer needs much in the same way that Wal-Mart works, and often in other ways that some consumers prefer.  In the recent past, K-Mart was the nation's top retailer, and before them, Sears was the big guy on the block.  Today it's Wal-Mart, and they seem to be discovering that being # 1 means being a more visible target for attacks.Production values on this video reflect the micro-budget of the project.  But the sincerity that comes across from Wal-Mart employees and customers in Galloway's film is far more appealing to watch than the propaganda that Greenwald admits to presenting in his ""anti-Walmart"" video.

951873,ANXYD5XVFVDCW,B000BWFSOA,"kaabee ""kabe""","[34, 76]","Amazing.  Wal-Mart has done wonders for this country as is demonstrated in this movie.  The fact that some many of those who hate liberty and capitalism take the opportunity to rail against this movie indicates the value of this movie.  When you get that many people who support tyranny complaining, there is something of value in a movie celebrating success and freedom.  (One review complains that this movie is similar to ""Triumph of the Will"" yet I'm sure he enjoyed the movie ""Mission to Moscow"", although both are slanted toward his ideology of supporting and sugar coating various types of tyranny, Missions to Moscow is politically acceptable to his way of thinking - but I digress).The simple fact is, if you don't like the way something is merchandised, purchase your goods elsewhere.  Unfortunately, most folks can't afford to shop at Nordstrom's, and find that Wal-Mart serves their needs perhaps at a more affordable price.Keep an open mind when you watch this one.  You'd be amazed how it might enlighten you.  My philosophy is simple to the extent that if I don't like the ideology of a company (such as Ben and Jerry's who are actively supporting the release of a convicted cop killer - Mumia Abu-Jamal) my reaction is different from those who hate Wal-Mart. I don't tell the government that they should shut down Ben and Jerry's or make it more difficult for them to produce, distribute or sell ice cream. If they feel that, by their despicable and contemptible actions and support of a murderer that they are doing some good, my response it to not support them. I simply refuse to purchase their product.  If anyone else wants to purchase their product, I won't stand in their way or demand that laws be passed to prevent a company from supporting an evil murdering bastard.  I happen to love the free market.For those who hate Wal-Mart, I suggest that you not shop there, and let the rest of us make our choices without interference or the use of force.  I understand that it's an unusual concept for those who support tyranny to understand, but, hey, I treasure liberty and freedom and those who are trying to shut down Wal-Mart don't.

951879,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000BWFSOA,Robert J. Crawford,"[100, 111]","This film pulls together all of the arguments in favor of wal-mart.  There is also a very interesting conclusion on the undeniable good work that the company did in summer 2005 in the Katrina-ravaged regions.  However, none of the legitimate concerns of critics are given any thoughtful review.  I say this as a concerned conservative, who wants to understand the enormous changes occuring in my country, and not a liberal.On the plus side, it is hard to argue against the business model of wal-mart:  it offers everyday low prices, which the company accomplishes by incredible and continual productivity gains - by some measures wal-mart is responsible for 25% of the productivity gains in the US due to its use of new technologies! - as well as vast scale economies in particular with globalisation.  Regardless of what critics say, these factors are the basis of the company's success:  consumers chose to buy there because of the prices and convenience.However, this is the point when the film becomes disingenuous.  Anything that critics say is summarily dismissed by either a single and simplistic example, by some self-appoined talking head, by employees who like their jobs, or simply by people passing by on the street.  I found this pathetically unconvincing.  For example, because wal-mart is criticised as a destructive force against traditional town centers, the filmmakers find one town that was able to renew itself as a tourist spot with boutiquie stores and then assumes that that can happen everywhere (but the site was in the Blue Mountains, not in the Oklahoma dustbowl).  No statistics are offered, no additional proof, and no counter-arguments are acknowledged.Moreover, it is easy to find people to spout the opinion you want to espouse by looking for them - to be sure, wal-mart critics do the same, but there are some critics who act like journalists and try to see what truth there is in the arguments advanced.  This film does not.  At one point, the filmakers interview a group of teenagers who state wal-mart wages would  ""enough"" for them (none of them work there), as if that refutes the experience of single mothers trying to make ends meet on wal-mart salaries!  They also get a few people to state that they never get asked to work overtime wothout pay as if that eliminates the need to investigate the claims of thousands of others who are winning multi-million dollar class-action lawsuits against that practice in their wal-marts.Finally, some of the talking heads make the most ridiculous arguments.  One of them dismissed all the arguments of critics who charge that wal-mart urges its workers to use the welfare system as ""those who advocate government health care anyway"" - as if that negates their arguments!  By glossing over the details, they don't even make the case in  favor of the wal-mart business model all that well, let alone consider how the intallation of a wal-mart impacts entire communities.As such, this film is for the convinced, for those who want to have their opinions reinforced rather than challenged.  That makes it like Fox news at its worst:  you know what you are going to get before you switch it on - pure opinion and little reporting - so why bother?  It isn't for learning.  The costs behind wal-mart's methods are not even open to question.  The one thing I took away from this is the sincerity of some of the employees, who genuinely believed in the company.Overall, I cannot recommend this film, except as a pure ideological view in favor of this controversial company.  This doesn't do anyone any good - there is no chance for dialogue in this approach, no acknowledgment that critics can make legitimate points.
