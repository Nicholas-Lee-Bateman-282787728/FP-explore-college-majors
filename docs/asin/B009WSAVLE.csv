1602948,AHNL75Y5PUEI,B009WSAVLE,Brandy,"[1, 1]",This is very nice and soothing and helps me feel more connected to the world around me. If you are a worry wort like I am it rents for a complete week (or mine did) and you can break it up and do separate parts each night. This helped me to learn to take better care of myself and be more in tune. I found these moments enlightening. I will purchase more of Christine Wushke's work.,4,Relaxing Moments,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,382,"['very', 'nice', 'soothing', 'feel', 'more', 'connected', 'world', 'are', 'worry', 'wort', 'am', 'complete', 'week', 'mine', 'did', 'can', 'break', 'up', 'do', 'separate', 'parts', 'night', 'helped', 'learn', 'take', 'better', 'care', 'myself', 'be', 'more', 'tune', 'found', 'moments', 'enlightening', 'will', 'purchase', 'more', 'Christine', 'Wushke', 'work']",Easy Yoga for Beginners with Christine Wushke

But at the beginning and end there is no warming up or cooling down, just lying down and that's it. Plus you need blankets and blocks, which would've been nice to know at the beginning.

A great way to start the day or relax after work.  Lots of good stretching.  If you do this regularly, it's obvious you'll be limber and elongated. This should be a complementary program to walking on the treadmill.

So many of the others are totally Hollywood or a little to far out there for me, but this is serene and relaxing.  So glad I have Amazon Prime, because I've done this video at least 1/2 dozen times this month.  Great way to start the day.
