666475,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B00005MP52,Amanda Pike,"[0, 1]","This is my second favorite version of Frankenstein.  It's not very true to the book but it is still a great film.  Don't confuse this with the original Bride of Frankenstein, this is more like what would have happened after The Bride of Frankenstein or if Dr. Frankenstein had followed through on making a mate for his creature. It can act as a quasi-sequel to any version of the Frankenstein story.It's a very sympathetic story toward the monster as well as towards the rights of women.  It has a kind of hammer horror quality to it, which I always feel gives a movie a Gothic charm, rather like Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. Also Sting makes for a very alluring, attractive and somewhat similar version of Dr. Frankenstein.A pet peeve of mine is when people say this is not horror.  I loathe when people say something is not horror just because it has romance or well developed characters.  Horror is not always mindless killing.  Traditional horror never was. This is GOOD horror. It IS Horror and to say it's not horror is an insult to the genre. It has death, it has suspense, it has the characters you care about in peril, it has danger, it has intrigue, it has man made monsters. It's horror. It's good Gothic horror but it's horror.  People forget what true, traditional Gothic horror entails.Special note: if you want a good faithful version of the Frankenstein story seek out the version starring Luke Goss as the creature from 2004 and made by Hallmark and released to DVD through Lion's Gate. That is the most faithful version to the novel.",5,I love this version.,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,1550,"['second', 'favorite', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'not', 'very', 'true', 'book', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'original', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'more', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'had', 'followed', 'making', 'mate', 'creature', 'can', 'act', 'quasi-sequel', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'story.It', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'story', 'monster', 'as', 'well', 'towards', 'rights', 'women', 'kind', 'hammer', 'horror', 'quality', 'always', 'feel', 'movie', 'Gothic', 'charm', 'rather', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Also', 'Sting', 'very', 'alluring', 'attractive', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'version', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein.A', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'when', 'people', 'say', 'not', 'horror', 'loathe', 'when', 'people', 'say', 'something', 'not', 'horror', 'just', 'romance', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'Horror', 'not', 'always', 'mindless', 'killing', 'Traditional', 'horror', 'never', 'was', 'GOOD', 'horror', 'Horror', 'say', 'not', 'horror', 'insult', 'genre', 'death', 'suspense', 'characters', 'care', 'peril', 'danger', 'intrigue', 'man', 'made', 'monsters', 'horror', 'good', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'horror', 'People', 'forget', 'what', 'true', 'traditional', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'entails.Special', 'note', 'want', 'good', 'faithful', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'story', 'seek', 'version', 'starring', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'creature', '2004', 'made', 'Hallmark', 'released', 'DVD', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'most', 'faithful', 'version', 'novel']",N/A

After being cast aside by his creator, the newly-renamed Viktor befriends a rogue dwarf named Rinaldo as the two set out to create a new life for themselves in Budapest. Meanwhile, Frankenstein attempts to shape the beautiful Eva into a modern woman, but his hidden desires and lack of control over her will lead to his final undoing. Sting stars alongside the lovely Jennifer Beals in 1985's THE BRIDE, a romantic re-imagining of THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Director Franc Roddam quickly divides the separate storylines, but finds difficulty in striking a balance between the two. Despite the title, we spend the majority of the film following Viktor and Rinaldo on their journey to join the Budapest circus, a friendship that is greatly built upon by Clancy Brown and David Rappaport's interactions on screen. Sting appears to be holding back as Frankenstein, delivering a bland performance that lacks raw emotion. Jennifer Beals, on the other hand, makes for a wonderful Bride, shouting ""You didn't create me! You didn't create ME!"" in an impassioned response to Frankenstein's claims over her.

Harvey ""Cricket ,country music and a go...","[0, 2]","This movie is quite obviously intent on being a ""serious ""version of the Frankenstein story .It comes across as dull and earnest and is marred by an excessive pomposity in script and overall treatment .In striving to be weighty it merely comes over as dull and stiltedBaron  Charles Frankenstein (Sting)has already created his male creature (Clancy Brown)when the movie starts and he is looking to make a mate for him ( Jennifer Beals) .As she is brought to life the laboratory explodes and she is carried to safety by Frankenstein who wrongly assumes that the male has perished in the fire .Quite obviously the good Baron has improved his skills considerably between making the male creature and building the woma -he is the archetypal  Frankenstein monster while she is a stunner .He decides to keep her for himself and raise her as a sort of Pygmalion experiment -he will create an educated ,  independent ,free spirited ""new woman""

cut between Eve and the male monster .He has escaped from the fire and is wandering the roads where he meets a dwarf (David Rappaport)and they strike up a friendship eventually joining a circus and becoming moderately successful and the monster assumes the name Viktor .Things go wrong when the dwarf is murdered and Viktor takes it upon himself to avenge his death and is forced to go on the run.The two creations gradually find their way to each other and even develop a telepathic link with one amother  and events move to a violent climaxI suspect this would like to think of itself as a message movie specifically a feminist movie.Eve does learn to think for herself and defies her creator but only to the extent of wanting another man -a dashing youung soldier rather than him.The other message is not notably profound either-Dont tamper with Nature .In short the standard horror movie schtickThe movie is badly acted .Sting resembles a block of wood in period garments and as for Ms

It seems that all the major studios, in a rush to get product on the shelves, are in the process of scouring through their back catalogues and releasing everything and anything available.

True, it is NOT a horror film, and yes, a musician is in the lead role(always a dubious casting move), but it does succeed on many levels.  This retelling of The Bride of Frankenstein works more as a romantic fantasy, and the narrative chugs along at quick, engrossing pace, especially the sub-plot of Victor(the Monster) and Rinaldo.  The many poignant moments between these two and the child-like demeanor of Victor gives the movie its soul.  That said, the ending is a bit of a dissappointment, which the director freely admits to on the commentary track, which is filled with relevant and amusing anecdotes about the film itself.So if anyone remembers this eighties artifact fondly, I say its a worthy addition to your collection.

666484,A1GY5M157FD82S,B00005MP52,"J. Austin ""jodylync""","[12, 13]","In 1985 when both Sting and Jennifer Beals were huge draws, this movie was created: A retelling of The Bride of Frankenstein.  On a dark and stormy night, Baron Frankenstein works feverishly in his lab trying to bring to life the agreed to Bride of the monster previously created.  Sting, as Frankenstein, is intelligent, determined, and methodical.  He brings to life his newest creation and quickly discovers that the mistakes he made when creating the man have been corrected, bringing to life a beautiful woman.  Upon seeing his bride, the monster (Clancy Brown)inadvertently hurts her.  Frankenstein strikes the monster and removes the bride from the creature's grasp.  A fight ensues and the monster flees into the night.  The next day Frankenstein names the woman Eva and decides to teach how to be &quot;as bold and as proud as a man.&quot;  Meanwhile, the creature runs into a little person named Renaldo (David Rappaport) who understands what it is like to be an outcast and befriends him.  As the movie progresses, we see two stories take place.  Eva becoming &quot;the new woman&quot; and the creature learning about life and friendship.I have always enjoyed this movie.  Sting is great as Frankenstein and plays him with a hint of madness that such a man would likely have been.  Jennifer Beals plays Eva with childlike innocence early on then shows the maturity of a bold, intelligent woman, but still she is disturbed about who she truly might be.  (Check out the scene when she does discover the truth.  Fantastic!)  Clancy Brown, too, shows growth and maturity in the development of the creature (later named Victor by Renaldo) from clumsy, confusion to brave determination.  Cary Elwes has the role of Josef, one of the Countess' guards.  And how can we forget the late David Rappaport as the compassionate and insightful Renaldo.  Through him we see the pain and prejudice he faces by being a little person.The extras on the DVD are few, but nice to have.  I don't recall ever seeing the trailer before so having it on the DVD was a plus.  The Director's commentary could have been better.  He admitted that it had been so long since he had seen the film.  Knowing this, he should have watched it a few times and made notes.  As it was, he forgot a lot of the information.  Later in the film, he would comment that the movie never addressed this or never addressed that when in actuality, the movie had established those things earlier in the movie.  To me, a great commentary is when the person commenting on the film is discussing the scene: either the actors or the background, or something relevant.  This director sometimes went on little tangents that had nothing to do with the movie at all.  I kept thinking &quot;can we please talk about this movie?&quot;  There was some good information though about the French scenery, how Sting got the role, the relationships between the actors, and the loss of David Rappaport.  So the commentary wasn't a total loss, but could have been better if the Director was better prepared.",4,Interesting and Dark,1006992000,"11 29, 2001",2001,3048,"['1985', 'when', 'Sting', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'were', 'huge', 'draws', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'retelling', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'Baron', 'Frankenstein', 'feverishly', 'lab', 'trying', 'bring', 'life', 'agreed', 'Bride', 'monster', 'previously', 'created', 'Sting', 'Frankenstein', 'intelligent', 'determined', 'methodical', 'life', 'newest', 'creation', 'quickly', 'discovers', 'mistakes', 'made', 'when', 'creating', 'man', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'bringing', 'life', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'seeing', 'bride', 'monster', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'inadvertently', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'bride', 'creature', 'grasp', 'fight', 'ensues', 'monster', 'night', 'next', 'day', 'Frankenstein', 'woman', 'Eva', 'teach', 'how', 'be', 'quot', 'bold', 'as', 'proud', 'man.', 'quot', 'Meanwhile', 'creature', 'little', 'person', 'named', 'Renaldo', 'David', 'Rappaport', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'outcast', 'movie', 'see', 'two', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'Eva', 'becoming', 'quot', 'new', 'woman', 'quot', 'creature', 'learning', 'life', 'friendship.I', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Sting', 'great', 'Frankenstein', 'hint', 'madness', 'man', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'been', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'Eva', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'early', 'then', 'maturity', 'bold', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'still', 'disturbed', 'who', 'truly', 'might', 'be', 'Check', 'out', 'scene', 'when', 'discover', 'truth', 'Fantastic', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'too', 'growth', 'maturity', 'development', 'creature', 'later', 'named', 'Victor', 'Renaldo', 'clumsy', 'confusion', 'brave', 'determination', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'role', 'Josef', 'one', 'Countess', 'guards', 'how', 'can', 'forget', 'late', 'David', 'Rappaport', 'compassionate', 'insightful', 'Renaldo', 'see', 'pain', 'prejudice', 'being', 'little', 'person.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'nice', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'so', 'having', 'DVD', 'was', 'plus', 'Director', 'commentary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'admitted', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'Knowing', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'made', 'notes', 'was', 'forgot', 'lot', 'information', 'Later', 'film', 'would', 'comment', 'movie', 'never', 'addressed', 'never', 'addressed', 'when', 'actuality', 'movie', 'had', 'established', 'things', 'earlier', 'movie', 'great', 'commentary', 'when', 'person', 'commenting', 'film', 'discussing', 'scene', 'actors', 'background', 'something', 'relevant', 'director', 'sometimes', 'went', 'little', 'tangents', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'kept', 'thinking', 'quot', 'can', 'please', 'talk', 'movie', 'quot', 'was', 'good', 'information', 'French', 'scenery', 'how', 'Sting', 'got', 'role', 'relationships', 'actors', 'loss', 'David', 'Rappaport', 'commentary', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'loss', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Director', 'was', 'better', 'prepared']",N/A

Instead of allowing her to mate with his male creation, he decides that he must have her for his own.  The enraged creature (Clancy Brown) destroys the tower laboratory and flees.  What follows is a touching, warm-hearted relationship between him and Rinaldo, a  midget (David Rappaport) he rescues from children who are teasing him.  The two misfits develop a close friendship and decide to travel to Budapest to join the circus.  Rinaldo gives his friend the name of Viktor.

It deals primarily with the strong bond of everlasting friendship.  Also, it emphasizes the timeless theme found in ""Beauty and the Beast"" - true beauty comes from within.  You can be hideously scarred on the outside and still have a beautiful heart.  This version of Frankenstein has one of the most happiest endings I have ever seen.

The original is an all time horror classic and it is viewed by some as the best horror movie ever. So if you haven't seen the original, you're missing something special. This remake is 50 years later and naturally is in color.Sting is a quiet reserved and brooding Dr. Frankenstein and this film is a different take on the classic story and not an exact remake. Sting is good as the doctor and Jennifer Beals is great as the title character. She brings a sexiness to the role that Elsa Lanchester could not. Boris Karloff can rest comfortably in his grave knowing that no one has topped his performance as the monster and that is very true here.  The original had some great supporting performances and every role is perfectly cast in the 1935 film- this one is more focused on the 2 leads and the Bride character is much more prominent in this movie.

Director Franc Roddam points out (on his DVD commentary) that he wanted to make a very different version of the old story by eliminating almost all elements of horror; so only the first ten minutes qualify as authentic horror.Roddam does not discuss the illogic of making a film devoid of the very elements its ""target audience"" was interested in seeing, but we already know that ""The Bride"" had a very poor showing at the box office. This target audience disconnect was most likely the cause. Nor does he comment on the failure to market the film to another audience segment; those interested in Gothic period pieces.It is especially cool that 20 years later the film is finally being discovered by this other audience and they are finding it a beautifully photographed example of their genre that emphasizes story-line and atmosphere over blood and gore.Even the much criticized casting of inexperienced leads Jennifer Beals and Sting (both look great in period costume) takes on a different dimension when the film is re-classified into the Gothic genre. Suddenly you see that the director was the one most responsible for the apparent lack of chemistry between the two stars, particularly Beals lack of passion in the scenes they share. These were the performances the Roddam wanted and not a reflection of inexperience or talent limitations. Which is not to say that Sting will ever be mistaken for a great acting talent but Beals has been unjustly criticized for a shallow performance when it was simply everything Roddam wanted it to be. Her character is only learning how to feel as the film progresses and as events play out we learn that her emotionless attitude simply conveys her indifferent feelings toward her creator.I highly recommend this movie as Roddam is an excellent stylistic director and has made a very good Gothic romance. The fantastic production design works to unify what are two stories as Roddam cuts back and forth between the Baron (Sting) teaching his creation Eva (Beals) while David Rappaport as Rinaldo teaches his other creation Victor, played by Clancy Brown. There is a psychic link between the two creations which will result in a interesting plot twist.Roddam has created a visually gorgeous film that has held up much better than the 1980's mainstream features that outperformed it at the box office. Don't be scared away by the negative comments, if you know what to expect (gothic romance not horror) almost any fan of films will enjoy ""The Bride"". I recommend the DVD, it was made from a flawless print and the widescreen presentation better showcases both the top-notch photography and the terrific work of the production designer.Then again, what do I know?

The lush, gorgeous music of Maurice Jarre lets you know this right from the start. I'll not blab away the plot, except to say that the separate adventures of the bride and the ""monster"" are paralleled cleverly by director Franc Roddam. Sting was good, as was Jennifer Beals. Clancy Brown as Viktor (the monster) had wonderfully realized sense of moral character, suspicious of kindness; grateful for friendship. His friendship is found in the person of Rinaldo, wonderfully played by David Rappaport. There's adventure, loss, renewal and a darn good story to go along with it.  As in Mary Slelley's tale, there is goodness and evil. Here, it's approached in a refreshing new way. This has a more satisfying ending. I only bought this film because I love Geraldine Page.

In the book, work begins on a bride for the creature, and is then abandoned, which leads to all sorts of unpleasantness.This film is sort of a exploration of how the story might have developed if work on the creatures mate had continued. Sting, of the Police, plays the Doctor, and Jennifer Beals plays his second creation. Obviously, his skills have improved from his first effort, however an accident in the lab leads to a fire, and the loss of the first creature, or so he believes. He then sets out to educate her as a continuing experiment. Meanwhile, the first creature is being educated by different experiences as he wanders the countryside, eventually befriending a dwarf who helps him find employment. Eventually, the creature and his intended bride cross paths again...with results which are perhaps unexpected, given their different backgrounds. This is perhaps the only Frankenstein film with an positive ending, attempting to show that even artificially created humans might have a soul, or a spirit, which seeks to rise above the limitations of the flesh.  The set design of the film was good, especially 'the masoleum'.
