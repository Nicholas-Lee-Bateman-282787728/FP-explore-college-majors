The good news is that Danny Trejo is in a film longer than 5 minutes before getting killed. The bad news is that the film could be a Lifetime production.The film opens with a young male being pursued, beaten and Mirandized by the police. We then jump to 3 years later with Javier (Danny Trejo) spying on the Chase family by taking photos. At this point everyone but Shaggy has got the plot figured out. Paul Chase, an attorney ... get it Chase an attorney, Oh how clever. Anyway, he was a former DA and now wants to remodel his kitchen in time for his wife's charity event. Unable to secure a contractor for twice the price of my doublewide, he turns to Trejo who sends him an e-mail from a friend. Apparently not everyone's idea of re-doing the kitchen is buying new contact paper to put over the old faded stuff.The funny clue is that Paul(Brad Rowe) remarks that Trejo has a &#34;familiar face.&#34; Seriously? Like someone could forget that mug. If you haven't figured out the whole plot by 53 minutes into the film, Elizabeth Chase (Christina Cox) explains it to us, almost like an aside as she talks to Kate (Arianne Zucker). Taylor Spreitler plays the daughter.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Not even a teaser shower. Some minor violence.

Elizabeth Chase (Cox) and her family have just moved into a new unfinished house. When she wants to hold a charity event at her house she begins to stress that her house won't be completely finished by the time the party arrives. When a friend of her husband recommends a local contractor guaranteed to get the job done they think they found thier solution but Javier (Trejo) isn't who they thought he was. Before I even start I do like Danny Trejo but it seems like he will do pretty much anything that comes his way. There is nothing wrong with that but he does do some real bombs. I will say that this one isn't terribe but after the first five minutes you can pretty much guess what will happen and you won't be wrong. To me, no matter how good a movie is if its too predictable it ruins the enjoyment a little. I will also admit that I really expected this to be pretty bad and it was actually better then I expected and if you are a big Trejo fan you will really enjoy this. Overall, not as bad as I was expecting but nothing to rush out and see. I give it a C+.",3,Danny Trejo fans will really like this one. It was better then I expected but nothing to rush and see.

But, once again, even though Mr. Trejo had a major role in this movie and was extremely good as the demented contractor bent on revenge, we simply didn't get to see him enough. At least this time his character was extremely electronics and computer savvy, and was able to wreak havoc on the alleged victims.  And, since I am a died in the wool Trejo fan once I found out the reasoning behind Mr. Trejo's revenge, I began to feel more sorry for him and less for the victims.
