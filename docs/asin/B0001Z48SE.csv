Kim Huffman decorates an otherwise dreary mish-mosh, but it is beyond her acting ability and girl-next-door appearance.  The detective tries to be so serious and tough.  The other assorted players are one dimensional:  the sister with marital problems, her straying husband, the neighbors, the female prosecutor, the villain, etc.Granted, there's not much in the script to work with, and the ending is blushingly silly silly silly.  The director didn't put up much of a fight to make this watchable.  It was made for TV movie, a genre famous for its shallowness.  Only Kim Huffman seemed to give this a genuine effort.  She's not exactly beautiful, nor does she have a great figure, but she has an appeal as a young woman you might meet anywhere.",2,"Ahhh, Ms. Huffman wasn't enough",1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,838,"['supposed', 'be', 'romance', 'think', 'maybe', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'comedy', 'Kim', 'Huffman', 'otherwise', 'dreary', 'mish-mosh', 'acting', 'ability', 'girl-next-door', 'appearance', 'detective', 'tries', 'be', 'so', 'serious', 'tough', 'other', 'assorted', 'players', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'sister', 'marital', 'problems', 'straying', 'husband', 'neighbors', 'female', 'prosecutor', 'villain', 'etc.Granted', 'not', 'much', 'script', 'work', 'ending', 'blushingly', 'silly', 'silly', 'silly', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'much', 'fight', 'make', 'watchable', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'genre', 'famous', 'shallowness', 'Only', 'Kim', 'Huffman', 'seemed', 'give', 'genuine', 'effort', 'not', 'exactly', 'beautiful', 'have', 'great', 'figure', 'appeal', 'young', 'woman', 'might', 'meet', 'anywhere']",Recipe for Revenge
817919,A3ELSU1SHRX09Y,B0001Z48SE,skunktrain,"[38, 41]","I initially was interested in seeing this movie because I'd read the book (""Bullets over Boise"") by Kristin Gabriel, who is one of my favorite romance writers. The plot of the movie strayed in more than a few places from the book, but the barebones plot was about the same, and the sense of humor and likeability of the characters was the same.The two main leads (Kim Huffman and Alex Carter) were very appropriate for this film. I was not disappointed that they were chosen for these rolls! Huffman plays a pretty (but somewhat zany) caterer who has a ""wholesome girl next door"" way about her. She's very likeable and natural and not at all self-conscious. (I dislike actresses that seem so *aware* of how beautiful they are. She doesn't do that.)  I really liked her.I've seen Alex Carter in other shows, and he usually plays a rather unlikeable fellow -- either a villian, or at least someone who is humorless and a little unpleasant. You can see why he'd be good in such parts -- he has this penetrating look and sharp (but handsome) features. But in this role he's very different. At first you think he's going to be the grim and brooding cop, but then he starts to show a sense of humor and an absolutely dazzling smile. Carter should play roles such as this one more often. He's great and is a wonderful complement to Huffman.The plot is flimsy and implausable in some ways, but I didn't care. It's cute. It's funny. It isn't one of those tedious ""chick flick"" type movies where the women are all tragic victims, or where nothing happens and we're bored to death. Stuff *happens*. There is adventure, drama, humor, and mystery! It's a lot of fun! It had more than a few wickedly funny lines that made me laugh out loud.Even though it is a Harlequin Romance movie, it's quite different (in a good way) from the other ones I've seen. I'm sure it didn't win any awards, but it holds up just fine and is quite entertaining. I'll definitely consider it to be a great addition to my DVD collection!",4,Delightful romantic adventure/comedy!,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,1999,"['initially', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'Bullets', 'Boise', 'Kristin', 'Gabriel', 'who', 'one', 'favorite', 'romance', 'writers', 'plot', 'movie', 'strayed', 'more', 'few', 'places', 'book', 'barebones', 'plot', 'was', 'same', 'sense', 'humor', 'likeability', 'characters', 'was', 'same.The', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'Kim', 'Huffman', 'Alex', 'Carter', 'were', 'very', 'appropriate', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'were', 'chosen', 'rolls', 'Huffman', 'pretty', 'somewhat', 'zany', 'caterer', 'who', 'wholesome', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'way', 'very', 'likeable', 'natural', 'not', 'self-conscious', 'dislike', 'actresses', 'seem', 'so', '*aware*', 'how', 'beautiful', 'are', ""n't"", 'do', 'really', 'liked', 'her.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Alex', 'Carter', 'other', 'shows', 'usually', 'rather', 'unlikeable', 'fellow', 'villian', 'least', 'someone', 'who', 'humorless', 'little', 'unpleasant', 'can', 'see', 'why', ""'d"", 'be', 'good', 'such', 'parts', 'penetrating', 'look', 'sharp', 'handsome', 'features', 'role', 'very', 'different', 'first', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'grim', 'brooding', 'cop', 'then', 'show', 'sense', 'humor', 'absolutely', 'dazzling', 'smile', 'Carter', 'should', 'play', 'roles', 'such', 'one', 'more', 'often', 'great', 'wonderful', 'complement', 'Huffman.The', 'plot', 'flimsy', 'implausable', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'cute', 'funny', ""n't"", 'one', 'tedious', 'chick', 'flick', 'type', 'movies', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'tragic', 'victims', 'where', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'bored', 'death', 'Stuff', '*happens*', 'adventure', 'drama', 'humor', 'mystery', 'lot', 'fun', 'had', 'more', 'few', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'lines', 'made', 'out', 'loud.Even', 'Harlequin', 'Romance', 'movie', 'quite', 'different', 'good', 'way', 'other', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'up', 'just', 'fine', 'quite', 'entertaining', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'consider', 'be', 'great', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection']",Recipe for Revenge

When she agrees to a Cyrano-situation where she cooks a meal for a friend to impress her new lover, she never suspects that she will be a witness to her murder.

When she starts to receive strange notes and attempts are made on her life, sexy detective Jack Brannigan (Alex Carter) moves in to watch over her, and the sparks begin to fly, much to neighbor Elliott's strife.Based on Kristen Gabriel's ""Bullets over Boise,"" the film retains the novel's chemistry thanks to great casting and the humor of the leads (particularly Jack's bumbling antics when he helps Carly on her catering assignments).
