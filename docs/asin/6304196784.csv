The lines are snappy, the acting is great, and I think that Kevin Kline totally deserved his Oscar. But it is so DIRTY! Sex scene after sex scene. Yet somehow, every single one of them made me snigger, laugh, and once even gasp for breath from laughing so hard. John Cleese plays a barrister (He's well suited for the role) who is defending the boss of three jewel thieves, played very well by Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Palin. The boss is being arrested on charges of animal cruelty, of all things. The title comes from the name of Palin's character's favorite goldfish, Wanda. I won't reveal any more of the plot, partly because it's so complicated and partly because I'd ruin the whole thing. I'll just let you watch and see how it goes for yourself.

Kevin Kline's performance as the boy friend was outstanding, Jamie Lee Curtis's role was incredibly humorous, John Cleese role was in my view understated, but still very funny.  It was very interesting to watch cleese character come to the conclusion that his marriage was a failure, and it was time to make an exit.  But Michael Palin's role touched me the most, because in the end this abused man finally found happiness.  The lenghts to which these people will go to deceive each other, really drive this film.

I know, Kline had won the Oscar and so maybe that should have sparked a little more interest, or at least faith in me, but I still saw this as a movie I was going to be mildly enthused about at best.  I was so wrong, for as the film started rapidly drawing to a close I found myself uttering aloud ""this movie is outrageous"" and I meant that in a wildly good way.The film tells the story of American jewel thief Wanda who uses her charm to seduce men whom she needs in order to get her hands on some very valuable diamonds.  Her lover Georges and his stuttering companion Ken help Wanda steal the jewels with the aid of Otto, another man whom Wanda has seduced and is passing off as her brother.  She has deceived each man into believing that her intentions are to share the jewels with them, when her intention is to take them for herself.  When Georges is captured by the police after moving the diamonds away from their initial hiding place Wanda begins to set her charms on Archie Leach, Georges barrister, hoping to find out the new location of the diamonds.  All the while she continues to string along each individual man, adding layer upon layer of lies to keep them pacified until she has all her ducks in a row so-to-speak.But nothing ever works out as expected.The film is hilarious from start to finish, a complete laugh-riot, and the performances by the entire cast are Oscar worthy.  Jamie Lee Curtis is adorable here, delivering what may be her finest performance ever.  She is sly, conniving, sexy and charming; never allowing her characters tricks to overshadow her performance but always playing to her strengths and delivering a brilliantly crafted comedic performance.  Michael Palin is also rather great as Ken, and Maria Aitken has a very memorable supporting role as Archie's wife Wendy.  John Cleese is golden as Archie, the lovelorn barrister who falls for Wanda's undeniable charm; but it is Kevin Kline (Oscar winner Kevin Kline) who steals this movie with his comedic delivery.  He is one-hundred percent on the top of his game here, delivering a strangely perverse yet fully fleshed out character who is unforgettable to say the least.Oh yeah, and he is so the leading male character here, regardless of whose name gets top billing.`A Fish Called Wanda' is, without doubt, one of the best films of 1988, and it is seriously one of the greatest comedies I have seen in a long time.  It hits every mark beautifully and creates an eclectic cast of characters who all feel real and all feel complete.  Oscar hit a high note when crowning Kline an Oscar winner; it's just too bad it was in the wrong category.",5,This fish is delicious...,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,2763,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'adore', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'expectations', 'were', 'rather', 'low', 'know', 'Kline', 'had', 'won', 'Oscar', 'so', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'sparked', 'little', 'more', 'interest', 'least', 'faith', 'still', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'mildly', 'enthused', 'about', 'best', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'film', 'started', 'rapidly', 'drawing', 'close', 'found', 'uttering', 'aloud', 'movie', 'outrageous', 'meant', 'wildly', 'good', 'way.The', 'film', 'story', 'American', 'jewel', 'thief', 'Wanda', 'who', 'charm', 'seduce', 'men', 'whom', 'order', 'get', 'hands', 'very', 'valuable', 'diamonds', 'lover', 'Georges', 'stuttering', 'companion', 'Ken', 'help', 'Wanda', 'steal', 'jewels', 'aid', 'Otto', 'man', 'whom', 'Wanda', 'seduced', 'passing', 'off', 'brother', 'deceived', 'man', 'believing', 'intentions', 'are', 'share', 'jewels', 'when', 'intention', 'take', 'herself', 'When', 'Georges', 'captured', 'police', 'moving', 'diamonds', 'away', 'initial', 'hiding', 'place', 'Wanda', 'set', 'charms', 'Archie', 'Leach', 'Georges', 'barrister', 'hoping', 'find', 'out', 'new', 'location', 'diamonds', 'string', 'along', 'individual', 'man', 'adding', 'layer', 'layer', 'lies', 'keep', 'pacified', 'ducks', 'row', 'so-to-speak.But', 'nothing', 'ever', 'out', 'expected.The', 'film', 'hilarious', 'start', 'finish', 'complete', 'laugh-riot', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'adorable', 'here', 'delivering', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'ever', 'sly', 'conniving', 'sexy', 'charming', 'never', 'allowing', 'characters', 'tricks', 'overshadow', 'performance', 'always', 'playing', 'strengths', 'delivering', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'comedic', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'also', 'rather', 'great', 'Ken', 'Maria', 'Aitken', 'very', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'role', 'Archie', 'wife', 'Wendy', 'John', 'Cleese', 'golden', 'Archie', 'lovelorn', 'barrister', 'who', 'Wanda', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'who', 'movie', 'comedic', 'delivery', 'one-hundred', 'percent', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'delivering', 'strangely', 'perverse', 'yet', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'who', 'unforgettable', 'say', 'least.Oh', 'yeah', 'so', 'leading', 'male', 'character', 'here', 'regardless', 'name', 'top', 'billing.', 'Fish', 'Called', 'Wanda', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1988', 'seriously', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'mark', 'beautifully', 'eclectic', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'feel', 'real', 'feel', 'complete', 'Oscar', 'hit', 'high', 'note', 'when', 'crowning', 'Kline', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'wrong', 'category']",Fish Called Wanda VHS

Jamie Lee Curtis is the perfect femme fatale where everybody wants her. Michael Palin is lovable as the stuttering animal activist who end up murdering three Yorkshire terriers. And John Cleese is wonderful as Archie the husband with a very tedious family life. A Fish Called Wanda is one of the wackiest, funniest pictures filmed. It ranks up there with M*A*S*H, This Is Spinal Tap, and Zorro, The Gay Blade. There are so many hilarious scenes throughout A Fish Called Wanda, and it is really Kevin Kline who makes many of them to work. Eventually, he deservingly won the Oscar for his masterful work.

It was quite popular, at the time of release, but I get the feeling that it has become somewhat forgotten lately (which is a real shame), since I would have to say, that it is one of the Best, most &#8216;well&#8211;rounded&#8217; and completely entertaining films (not just among comedies), that I have ever seen &#8211; everything &#8216;Works&#8217; as they say!  The excellent Leads are John Cleese (of Monty Python fame, who also co-wrote this most impressive script) and Jamie-Lee Curtis (at the height of her significant acting prowess/ peak charismatic presence), with expert &#8216;assists&#8217; from Kevin Kline (who won a best supporting actor Oscar, for this role), and Michael Palin (the second-Best Python)! This is a true ensemble piece, full of very sharp/ nimble character interplay, and extremely witty dialogue (of a sort that they seem hardly able to write anymore &#8211; sort of a &#8216;throwback&#8217; to the classic &#8216;screw-ball&#8217; comedies of Hollywood Legend, but also very much &#8216;modernized&#8217;).  The story is also intriguing, and keeps the audience &#8216;on its toes&#8217; with zig-zagging twists & turns!  This is one of those very Rare films that can deftly switch literally from the Sublime to Ridiculous, instantaneously (e.g. from the seemingly heartfelt and genuine &#8216;affection&#8217; expressed between Cleese&#8217;s straight-Laced British Barrister Character & the enticing &#8216;Wanda&#8217; &#8211; immediately seguing directly to the insane/ deranged hijinks of Kevin Kline&#8217;s &#8216;Otto&#8217; = who is actually also Wanda&#8217;s sometime partner-in-crime!).

The comic timing and sheer talent of the cast, make this one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched.  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie, it is difficult to describe without resorting to spoilers.  One thing I will say, however, is that this film has made an indellible impact on my family.  Hardly a family gathering will go by, without someone saying, ""Oh do shut up, Porche!""  Some of the most hilarious scenes, in my opinion, are between Otto (Kevin Kline) and Ken (Micheal Palin).  Strangely, even though the character's are supposed to be a band of thieves, you can't help but almost root for this gang of underdogs.  Speaking of Dogs, some of the scenes may not appeal to animal lovers.  However, these scenes are handled in a fairly cartoonish and very ""Monty Python"" fashion, so I don't think they will insult the sensibilities of most viewers.  This movie was given an R rating, mostly for dialog and a brief view of Cleese's buttocks, but I doubt that it would even receive a PG-13 rating now.

My high school drama class went to see a sneak preview double feature of Wanda and Monkey Shines (which I will only go as far as to say that it was pretty awful) and I was floored.I knew about Monty Python and has all the episodes that my PBS affiliate would broadcast, but was relatively unfamiliar with any work the troupe's members had done outside of the series (I don't even think I had seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail yet), except for a late-night cable run-in with Michael Palin's The Missionary, a mild sex comedy about a missionary and a home for fallen women.I had no idea what to expect. Palin had always been my favorite Python (and still is), so I was very curious to see what he would do outside the Python realm. I got more than I bargained for.Written by John Cleese from a story by Cleese and director Charles Crichton (various Ealing comedies including The Lavender Hill Mob), A Fish Called Wanda is a comedy about four crooks (Jamie Lee Curtis: Wanda, Kevin Kline: Otto, Tom Georgeson: George, and Michael Palin: Ken) who are all trying to double-cross each other by linking with other members of the group. Wanda in particular has the cards stacked in her favor, as she is--in one way or another--attempting to seduce all three men.The humor comes from several directions. As the old lady is the only one who can ID any of them, George asks Ken to eliminate her. Unfortunately, he keeps killing her pet dogs instead--one at a time. As an animal lover, this leaves Ken in no end of distress. Very black humor, indeed. Meanwhile, Otto is trying to get information from Ken by pretending to be gay. Ken isn't either, but Otto doesn't seem to care. He continues to come on to him. (Kline won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year for his performance as Otto.)Surprisingly, A Fish Called Wanda has stood up well over time. It is still one of the films that I continue to return to for dependable belly laughs.

Written by Cleese and set in London, this comedy has the drama of a bank robbery and subsequent legal proceedings and a romantic twist.  Yet, this is not a ""chick flick"" by any means.  Cleese's Monty Python buddy Michael Palin delivers a stellar performance as the stuttering hold-up sidekick, as JC plays the barrister (defense lawyer) for the man who organized the robbery.  Again...since Cleese wrote it and sets it in London, there are only 2 American main characters (which in typical British form) Cleese busts on by giving them playfully negative American stereotypes: Jamie Lee Curtis plays a girl who will (let's keep it clean) ""hook up with"" and then stab in the back anyone who can make her rich.  And Kevin Kline plays an obnoxious, loud-mouthed vulgarian who pretends to be smart and classy, but truly shows no intelligence and is gauche and tasteless.  Don't take it too seriously though, my fellow Americans....this movie is great fun!  The story unfolds beautifully, and the subtly developing romance between Cleese and Curtis (which begins as an opportunistic ruse by Curtis that blossoms into something more) is handled quite well.

This is a pet area of co-writer and star Cleese who has had three American wives and nurtures a fascination for the differences between the two cultures. This can be seen both in his work with Monty Python and in the Fawlty Towers episode The Americans. The conflict created between the characters' backgrounds creates much of the magic and gives the picture its transatlantic appeal. Cleese gives a career best performance as an actor, being surprisingly vulnerable in the love scenes and making us believe that he has fallen in love with Jamie Lee Curtis. Kline won an deserved Oscar for his very very funny supporting role, but all four stars contribute equally to this post-modern Ealing comedy. This leads me to mention director Charles Crichton. In his last feature film, Crichton was in his late seventies when this was made. Having directed classic Ealing comedies The Titfield Thunderbolt and The Lavender Hill Mob, Crichton had retired from feature films in the 1960s and since then had turned in many well received episodes of television series such as The Avengers and The Professionals.

The dvd containes both full-screen and wide-screen formats, which is nice, because it's a good full screen film, so that's how I'll view it until I get a widescreen television. On the other hand, the 1:85:1 presantaion is non-anamorphic (Which MGM DVD'S are, though?). The 2-channel mono is thin and unrealistic, and the picture quality beats out my old analog rectangle, which I sold at a yard sale. However this  is, cheap, and I hear of an upcoming re-release. I won't buy it, because I already own it, although I might have to exchange this on Ebayif they have deleted scenes, no more mono, and restored and /or remastered picture and/or sound. The booklet spends too much time telling details must fans already know, like the difference between wide-screen and full-screen. There is also an easter egg where wanda the fish is floating around on your television screen. I am just glad that this is on DVD.  I understand that this came out at a time of no special features, but MGM rushed to get this out. They did the best they could, but why didn't they just wait 6 more months and give it a prper release? Only about 5% of the population HAD DVD players when this came out...I'm probably comnplaining for no use, because all I really want to see is possible deleted scenes.

For those of us that are not of that time dated jokes leave us asking ""huh?"".Unfortunately, this film falls into that category and while there are a few scenes especially between Palin and Cleese that drew a smile from me in remembrance of the great Python days the rest of the film was desperately dated and had me looking at the clock wishing it would end.  1988 must also have been a very bad year for films as that would explain how Kline could win his Oscar.  Cleese is a funny actor but he is certainly not a scriptwriter.  From the opening credits that were in an off-putting deep blue to the horrible score and background music this film doesn't even begin well.  Highly overrated and a film that ages very, very poorly it isn't helped by this very poor dvd version with horrible mono sound quality and even worse picture quality that is full of white spots and other imperfections.

406654,A2BPDFR58H9575,6304196784,Galina,"[5, 6]","A Fish Called Wanda (1988) is for comedy what Citizen Kane is for drama, Godfather Part 1 and 2 for gangster epics, and 2001: Space Odyssey for science fiction  - it is one of the best in its genre. This is a work of the comic genius. It is always funny and never goes out of breath.  The film is shining and sparkling like the diamonds of the highest quality - just like these that made four thieves who have pulled the heist of their lives to stop at nothing, including lies, deceit, backstabbing, and betrayal, in order to possess them. The film was made 22 years ago but time has nothing over A Fish Called Wanda. It has not gotten outdated or stalled and it never will. It is a marvel that can be enjoyed over and over. AFCW has become a cult favorite for my family. Many quotes and jokes from the comedy are the part of our everyday conversations, and we use them often even forgetting where they came from:  ""Disappointed!"", ""Don't call me stupid"", ""You have a beautiful speaking voice - when it works"", ""You British think you are so superior"", ""What was the part in the middle?"", ""Avoid the green ones. They're not ripe yet."" ""When you say ""friendly"", what are we talking about here? Cordial? Courteous? Supportive? What?"" There are many more.A Fish Called Wanda is a real ""treasure"", and it is not just my opinion. The film which was a great success with the critics and the box offices when it was released has been included in all possible lists of the funniest movies and the best comedies. I looked them all up. :) My younger son, who lists AFCW as one of his favorite comedies, wrote the review about it and posted on this very site. He says in the end of his review: ""The film is close to 2 hours long, but the plot is so clever and well-structured that it's over before you know it. To me, that is one of the trademarks of a great film. You don't want this movie to end, and you're disappointed when it does."" I can add that as soon as it is over I want to watch it from the beginning and experience the magic of great movie making again. Very talented artists participated in making A Fish Called Wanda, and everything in the film turned out simply perfect. What makes the film truly funny all actors, including in the small cameos, created memorable characters because they had wonderfully constructed and written script to work with.  John Cleese deserves the first mention for his excellent triple work as the co-writer of the Oscar nominated script/co-director and the star in the role of Archie Leach, the well-mannered English gentleman whose marriage seems to be in crisis, the defender of George, the leader of the diamonds thieves who keeps the ""key"" to the coveted loot to himself. Cleese's partner Python - Michael Palin is excellent as shy, stuttering hit-man Ken who is secretly in love with Wanda, tenderly loves animals but is ready to help an inconvenient witness to ""meet with an accident, even if it is a very old lady with a weak heart. Loud, pushy and sexually liberated Americans are represented in the film by Wanda (always charming and illuminating the screen Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto, the former CIA operative, the expert in all kinds of weapons (Kevin Kline in the Oscar winning performance) whom she introduces ad her brother. Wanda is as seductive and sexy as she is clever, unscrupulous, conniving and backstabbing. What she wants she sure will get. She is much cleverer than all men around her combined together but seems that in the end she might find the right man. And finally, Otto, ""the ape who reads philosophy but does not understand it...the man so stupid that calling him stupid is insult to stupid people"" who does not realize how vulgar and intellectually challenged he is. In the movie where there is no bad or boring performance at all, Kline is outstanding. A talented film and stage actor who has performed in many Shakespeare's plays, he would never have the role as brilliant and funny as Otto.You can write the volumes about A Fish Called Wanda but they will not explain its charm. One of the reasons that makes the film so funny is playing the differences or in this case, the conflicts and clashes between the different cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking (even if the same language), behaving, presenting oneself. But it is just one of the reasons, there are many more.  I only add that there is documented the known death of a viewer from laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda. It happened in Denmark in 1989. The audiologist named Ole Bentz laughed so hard while watching the film that his heart rate was pounding between 250 and 500 beats per minute which led to the fatal heart attack. It is certainly a tragedy but come to think of it, a person died while being happy on the top of enjoyment.  I envy such death.And finally, a famous Russian writer and poet of 19th century, Alexander Pushkin wrote in his play 'Mozart and Salieri', ""If the sad and dark thoughts come to your mind, Just open a bottle of Champagne or Read again the ""Marriage of Figaro."" (Translation is mine)I just would add - or watch again ""A Fish Called Wanda.""",5,Treasure!,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,5132,"['Fish', 'Called', 'Wanda', '1988', 'comedy', 'what', 'Citizen',

It's still hilarious today, and it has something that most modern comedies don't even come close too...consistency.  Almost every joke works.  There isn't a dull moment in the entire film.  It is meticulously done by John Cleese and Charles Cricton.  Cleese wrote the screenplay, and Crichton directed it.  Crichton is best known for the great Ealing comedy The Lavender Hill Mob (which is a wonderful film starring Alec Guiness).  I really like the digs that Cleese gets at the expense of Otto, here portrayed brilliantly by Kevin Kline.  Kline is so reminiscent of the pseudo-intellectual babbling that permeates many parts of our society today.  The scene where Wanda (Jaime Curtis) berates him for pissing off Archie Leach (Cleese's character, and Cary Grant's real name) is my favorite scene in the film.  Jamie says the line ""apes do read philosophy, Otto, they just don't understand it"".  Many read, many watch art films, important films, read big books, but don't understand a damn thing.  But Otto is so naturally stupid that his pseudo-intellectualism is funnier.All of the players here are excellent.  Kline won a best supporting actor Oscar for his role (one of the few times a comedic performance won), and Palin is wonderful as K-K-K Ken (as Otto affectionately calls him), the killer who loves animals.  The film gets a bit nasty, but then it's British, so this is to be expected.  This film, despite a modern setting, is really reminiscent of Crichton's Ealing comedies, and I think that's what makes it very funny and special.

Cleese also performs here one of the most side-splitting stripteases I have ever seen. I literally doubled-over with laughter!A  twenty million dollar jewelry heist is pulled off in London's Hatton Gardens by four eccentric misfits, two Brits and two Americans. George (Tom Georgeson) is the ringleader, the man who masterminded the theft. He is the only one who knows where the jewels are hidden. His partners in crime include animal lover, Ken Pile, (Michael Palin), a socially inept bumbler with a stuttering problem. He loves his goldfish, Wanda, (named for the movie's heroine), with the passion most attach to their significant other. Wanda Gershwitz, (Jamie Lee Curtis), is George's girlfriend, who uses her formidable seduction techniques to get what she wants, and she wants all the money! Wanda finagles to bring Otto West, (Kevin Kline), into the gang, telling the others he is her brother - although like most other men in the film, he is her lover.

As Wanda remarks, ""He's so dumb he thought the Gettysburg Address was where Lincoln lived.""The ploys, dirty tricks and double-crosses Otto and Wanda use against their partners, to prevent their receiving a share of the loot, are classic. When George's lawyer, Archie, (John Cleese), falls in love with Wanda, her formidable skills at juggling men are seriously challenged. Cleese brings an endearing romantic touch to the smitten Archie. The situation grows more and more convoluted and the laughs build right along with the escalation. Otto is extremely jealous of any man who looks twice at Wanda, and obviously Archie takes more than two glimpses. Madcap madness!I don't want to disclose any more of the plot here, but ""A Fish Called Wanda"" contains some of the funniest scenes I have viewed on film. Director Charles Crichton keeps the pace moving at a nice clip and the satire involving the cultural clash between the very proper, if somewhat stuffy English, versus the uncouth, aggressive Yanks is pure delight. At one point, Archie says to Wanda: ""Do you have any idea what it's like to be English? We're all terrified by embarrassment. That's why we're all dead!""This flaky farce is a must see! A definite 5 star film, I am rating this only 4 stars, however, because of the poor quality of the DVD.

406675,A28ERDII8FZQQ9,6304196784,J. Daniel,"[4, 7]","John Cleese and Michael Palin may be most famous for their Monty Python troupe, Jamie Lee Curtis for Halloween, and Kevin Kline for...being in movies, but one of their most memorable movies is the first one they did together. Which one? A Fish Called WandaCurtis is Wanda, part of a diamond group along with Ken (Palin), George Thomason (Tom Georgeson), and her ""brother"" Otto (Kline). They pull off a multi-million pound heist in England, and hide the loot. It seems, though, that Wanda and Otto (who aren't actually brother and sister but lovers) want it all for themselves. So they turn George into the police to try to find out where he hid the loot. It seems the only person George would have told about where the loot is would be his barrister Archie Leach (Cleese). So, naturally, Wanda goes up to him and becomes `friends' with him, much to the dismay of Otto.A Fish Called Wanda is a twistful and delightful comedy that shows the new sex comedies that they don't need gross body functions to be funny. I'm not saying this movie is completely tasteful. Ken, who is an animal lover, accidentally kills dogs. But, it's not too explicit. It's actually very funny.Most of the humor comes from Kline, who always shows up whenever Archie and Wanda are together, and who pretends he's gay and tries to get Ken. Some of those subplots, such as the gay one and Kline hating people that call him stupid, seem to not matter. But it is funny. Cleese's script is full of surprises. And most of these laughs were genuine, unlike the fakey ones from other movies. Who can forget Kline's shout whenever he's in the car? It is a memorable movie.Kline puts up his best comedic performance, and deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. He has excellent comedic timing, always putting the joke on at the right time. He had great chemistry with everyone; it seemed to blend in with the lifestyles of the others. Curtis (one of my favorite actresses)was excellent in a comedic role. Of course, Cleese and Palin are no strangers to comedy. Cleese seemed like a typical British person-stuck up and courteous. He actually talks about that during the film. Palin was great with a stutter that actually is an important part of the film.It seems that A Fish Called Wanda thinks itself as `bad' and `let's offend everyone!' However, it's one of the more tasteful comedies I've seen recently. Its jokes are almost always funny and tasteful, with Kline's trigger-happy attitude that explodes every once in a while. This group, that came back for 1997's Fierce Creatures, were excellent and they look like they had fun together. Which is good for them. However, after the first forty minutes or so, the humor kind of wavers and it becomes a little uneven. There are still jokes, of course, but not as rapid-fire as the ones before. But considering the humor of the film in its entirety, it could be considered a moot point.A Fish Called Wanda is a very hilarious comedy that you'll remember for a while, and looks like it can stick up for repeated viewings, because there are so many jokes you'll forget a lot of them.",4,Hilarious!

The dialogue is simply hysterical, and still likeable, which I think is truly rare in a film.

406687,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,6304196784,jude pepper,"[1, 3]","i hate to sound like a prude, but i don't have a great deal of patience with R-rated movies (there's maybe a dozen in my top 100), particularly from the last decade or so. i recall being a gradeschool boy at a time when the R-rating was positively notorious for an edgy but noble and beautiful reason. whenever we managed to rent, or sneak into a theater playing, such a movie, we said to ourselves, ""YIPEEEEEEE! NAKED WOMEN!"" what goes on in the mind of such a schoolboy of this age, when the leading reason or an R-rating is a much more sinsister (not to mention tiresome) one? please tell me they're not going, ""YIPEEEEEEEE! an F-bomb in EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE!!""but either way it's a stumbling block, specifically the pointless titilation factor. the fact of the matter is, 90% of the time (probably a hell of a lot more), that R is for something incidental that the filmmakers threw into the pot just because they could. how often, really, does a non-slasher film get an R-rating for an integral, necessary element of the plot, something they would've been just plain powerless to tell the story properly without? by my calculations, the last one was MONTY PYTHON'S LIFE OF BRIAN...way back in 1979.nothing has a greater power to taint a film i might otherwise enjoy, or push one i'm not really enjoying past the Point Of No Return, than too many of those ""F"" words. but somehow (don't ask me how, because i couldn't explain if my life depended on it), there are a few film that manage not to suck in spite of it, such as THIS IS SPINAL TAP or THE USUAL SUSPECTS. oh yes, there's also the one i should be focusing on, John Cleese's post-Python masterpeice A FISH CALLED WANDA.WANDA takes us to the place where the ""heist"" movie of more recent decades meets the ""screwball"" comedy of the '30s and '40s. (who knew such a place even existed?) Cleese is faultless (if formula) in his tried-and-true officious bureacrat mode, in this case a stodgy lawyer (barrister (sorry!!)) named Archie Leach. (nice bonus, since i'm a Cary Grant fan as well.) the rest of the cast are just as letter perfect as the slimier sort of character. Cleese's old Python-mate Michael Palin delivers in spades in what some would consider a thankless role, that of the wimpy stutterer. (not to take anything away from Eric Idle or Terry Jones, but i have heard that when the BBC commissioned what would become MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS, they described what they were hoping for as The Cleese & Palin Show.) Jamie Lee Curtis, whom i must confess isn't the sort of person i fantasize about, plays the femme fatale part and is much sexier than i would've previously given her credit for being capable of. even Kevin Kline, usually the archetypal nice and/or normal fellow (see another of my favorite films, Ivan Reitman's DAVE), took home an Oscar for playing against type...to such a degree that legend has it his reply to the finished film was, ""well, it was a fun career while it lasted.""(quite the contrary, he earned that Oscar and is the most unique thing about the film. in comedy, the villains tend to be scenery chewers like Sig Ruman (in The Marx Brothers' movies), or pompous buffoons like Dr. Evil. how often can the genre get away with a character as genuinely dangerous as Otto? only one other one springs to mind, namely Thomas ""Biff"" Wilson from BACK TO THE FUTURE.)Cleese's script is good enough, the characters are multifaceted enough, in short the finished product is funny enough, to actually somehow rise above Cleese's ill-advised use of the aforementioned blitzkrieg curse method. (critics have said that the operative question is, HOW are you using it and WHAT are you using it for, because artistry and craftsmanship can redeem anything. this explains how, for instance, DEXTER can get away with it's audacious serial-killer-as-hero premise.) but i repeat, that doesn't make it a good idea that's worth the risk. films that overindulge in that word as much as WANDA does and still work are flukes, pure an' simple.i can't let this review pass without singing the praises for one of the most underrated films ever made, the Cleese/Curtis/Kline/Palin reunion FIERCE CREATURES. John Cleese has said that it suffered at the box office because of the standard set by WANDA, that it just wasn't worth it, and he wouldn't bother if he could take it back. well, i for one am quite delighted that he can't take it back. just because a film doesn't make a splash doesn't make it a poor one, anymore than because it does make a splash makes it a good one. WANDA and CREATURES are more than fitting companion pieces.",5,"SOMETHING FISHY HERE (well, that'd be funny if John Cleese said it.)",1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,4604,"['i', 'hate', 'sound', 'prude',

Unfortunately the end result was as appealing as chocolate-covered bacon (yes, I saw that featured in a restaurant I went to).The basic story is about a group of diverse people-two Americans, two Britons-who rob a British bank, and inevitably betray one another.  One gets arrested and Cleese plays his defense counsel, initially believing him innocent.  But to the frustration of the others, the one in jail has managed to conceal the robbery's takings, and the others scheme to find out where they are.Unfortunately the comedy depends on shock humor including crass stereotypes of loud, obnoxious Americans and comatose Britons, and overacted so that the movie tends to be more annoying than genuinely funny.  As a crime drama, it isn't very clever either.  In the end, the movie is barely passable and certainly doesn't live up to the hype it received.",2,Disappointing,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,988,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'praise', 'movie', 'heard', 'how', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'fusion', 'Monty', 'Python', ""1950's-60"", 'Ealing', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'as', 'appealing', 'chocolate-covered', 'bacon', 'yes', 'saw', 'featured', 'restaurant', 'went', '.The', 'basic', 'story', 'group', 'diverse', 'people-two', 'Americans', 'two', 'Britons-who', 'rob', 'British', 'bank', 'inevitably', 'betray', 'one', 'One', 'arrested', 'Cleese', 'defense', 'counsel', 'initially', 'believing', 'innocent', 'frustration', 'others', 'one', 'jail', 'managed', 'conceal', 'robbery', 'takings', 'others', 'scheme', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'are.Unfortunately', 'comedy', 'shock', 'humor', 'including', 'crass', 'stereotypes', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'Americans', 'comatose', 'Britons', 'overacted', 'so', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'annoying', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'crime', 'drama', ""n't"", 'very', 'clever', 'end', 'movie', 'barely', 'passable', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'received']",Fish Called Wanda VHS

406699,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,6304196784,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[39, 46]","Starting with the commonplace idea of a jewel robbery gone maniacally wrong, actor John Cleese and director Charles Crichton manage have created a madcap comedy that remains fresh, even after 10 years.  George (Tom Georgeson), assisted by his girlfriend Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), his best pal Ken (Michael Palin) and Wanda's 'brother' Otto (Kevin Kline) has orchestrated a robbery that has only one fatal flaw - none of the participants have any intention of sharing the loot.  In short order, double-crosses seem to grow on trees and George finds himself under arrest.  It is only fitting that Wanda and Otto simultaneously discover that the jewels have been moved 'for safekeeping.'It doesn't take very long for Wanda to figure out that her only hope of regaining the loot is through George's barrister, Archie Leach (John Cleese).  Wanda works at seducing Leach while fighting of Otto's psychotic fits of jealousy.  Ken, in the meantime, attempts repeatedly to kill the only witness, an elderly woman.  Unfortunately, he manages to assassinate all three of her dogs in the process.This is a set up for the combination of slapstick, vulgarity, and tongue-in-cheek comedy that British films are noted for and Americans love and it is delivered with an almost evil verve.  Cleese is determined to take no prisoners, and the landscape is littered with car crashes, fallen masonry, savaged canines (fake savaged canines, please) and hapless victims.  Only the fish (also called Wanda) has no funny lines, and fares no better than her companion 'Lunch' does.The film has an R rating, which I think is exaggerated.  In reality, its vulgarity and sexual innuendo are hardly noticeable when compared to what is accepted today.  I certainly think teenagers can handle it without permanent damage, although you may have to explain to them that certain phrases don't bear repeating.  At this price, expect a bare bones DVD.  No added games, no interviews, just the film in French and English, in both wide screen and standard presentations.  Even so, this is a classic comedy that will bear much watching.",4,Are You Totally Deranged?,1023667200,"06 10, 2002",2002,2096,"['Starting', 'commonplace', 'idea', 'jewel', 'robbery', 'gone', 'maniacally', 'wrong', 'actor', 'John', 'Cleese', 'director', 'Charles', 'Crichton', 'manage', 'have', 'created', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'fresh', 'even', '10', 'years', 'George', 'Tom', 'Georgeson', 'assisted', 'girlfriend', 'Wanda', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'best', 'pal', 'Ken', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'Wanda', 'Otto', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'orchestrated', 'robbery', 'only', 'one', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'none', 'participants', 'have', 'intention', 'sharing', 'loot', 'short', 'order', 'double-crosses', 'seem', 'grow', 'trees', 'George', 'arrest', 'only', 'fitting', 'Wanda', 'Otto', 'simultaneously', 'jewels', 'have', 'been', 'moved', ""'for"", 'safekeeping', ""'It"", ""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'long', 'Wanda', 'figure', 'out', 'only', 'hope', 'regaining', 'loot', 'George', 'barrister', 'Archie', 'Leach', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Wanda', 'seducing', 'Leach', 'fighting', 'Otto', 'psychotic', 'fits', 'jealousy', 'Ken', 'meantime', 'attempts', 'repeatedly', 'kill', 'only', 'witness', 'elderly', 'woman', 'Unfortunately', 'assassinate', 'three', 'dogs', 'process.This', 'set', 'up', 'combination', 'slapstick', 'vulgarity', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'comedy', 'British', 'films', 'are', 'noted', 'Americans', 'love', 'delivered', 'almost', 'evil', 'verve', 'Cleese', 'determined', 'take', 'prisoners', 'landscape', 'littered', 'car', 'crashes', 'fallen', 'masonry', 'savaged', 'canines', 'fake', 'savaged', 'canines', 'please', 'hapless', 'victims', 'Only', 'fish', 'also', 'called', 'Wanda', 'funny', 'lines', 'better', 'companion', ""'Lunch"", 'does.The', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'think', 'exaggerated', 'reality', 'vulgarity', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'are', 'hardly', 'noticeable', 'when', 'compared', 'what', 'accepted', 'today', 'certainly', 'think', 'teenagers', 'can', 'handle', 'permanent', 'damage', 'may', 'have', 'explain', 'certain', 'phrases', 'do', ""n't"", 'bear', 'repeating', 'price', 'expect', 'bare', 'bones', 'DVD', 'No', 'added', 'games', 'interviews', 'just', 'film', 'French', 'English', 'wide', 'screen', 'standard', 'presentations', 'Even', 'so', 'classic', 'comedy', 'will', 'bear', 'much', 'watching']",Fish Called Wanda VHS
406700,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,6304196784,Marty Gillis,"[6, 7]","""A Fish Called Wanda"" is a top notch comedy and those who have seen and love this film would agree.  This review will focus on the Blu Ray transfer, both video and audio.For those of you that are not even slightly technically inclined you may wish to skip this review altogether and just know that this version is the best currently available of this film.""Wanda"" is presented on a single BD50 disc w/ decent disc artwork. Why mention it? Well, many of my latest Blu Ray acquisitions while pricey only give me a standard gray paint job similar to a rental disc and I find it refreshing whenever a budget release includes nice touches to the packaging. Unfortunately the box is another one of those 'more air than plastic' Eco cases that I am growing to hate.The video quality is not as bad as other reviews around the web would lead you to believe.  The main problem lies with the print used. It is tired, dull, flat, faded, lifeless and full of small imperfections and print damage. (is THAT all??)Also, the studio did not see fit to even ATTEMPT a little tinkering to improve the situation. They should have.  With that said, my Oppo BDP-93 Blu Ray player has a very nice and handy video processing chip and for a title like this I was able to tweak ""Wanda"" into looking pretty darn good compared to it's out of the box appearance.  I kicked in the contrast enhancement and color enhancement by one notch each, and same goes with the artificial sharpening.  Normally I stay away from ALL extra processing on my Blu Ray titles, but in THIS case it has made a huge world of difference.Now why in the heck couldn't the studio have done this with the existing file before release? My first guess would be sheer laziness as just about anyone can dial in a fairly decent looking rendering for this film with a minimal amount of tweaking and knob twiddling.Basically, ""Wanda"" is about 3 stars out of the box, but with a small amount of effort on YOUR part, you can bump that up to ALMOST 4 stars.  This all leads me to believe that just a small amount work on MGM's home video department could have made a world of difference in the end product here.  You still get the print damage and a very small amount of telecine wobble at the start of the movie, but overall with a bump in contrast, color and sharpness you can tweak a very pleasing image out of this disc.Yes, we should NOT have to deal with this sort of thing when we plunk down our hard earned cash on a Blu Ray disc.  Still, it is nice to know you can 'digitally massage' the file on the disc and yield a pleasing result.How about the sound? Ahhh, while not a demo presentation such as the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, the sound is for the most part pleasing and more than adequate.  An original mono mix has been slightly expanded into DTS HD Master audio 5.1 and while most of it is quite center channel heavy, you do get a nice spread on both the music and sound effects from time to time.  No tinkering required by the way!  I never found myself cursing the audio and overall it was a pleasing experience.The extras include over two hours of documentaries, out takes, interviews, etc. If you are a fan of the film or a John Cleese fan in particular you will enjoy all of them. Cleese also provides an excellent running commentary of the film, very entertaining and a cut above many commentaries that just seem to be tacked on later as a sell point. All the extras are in SD except for the theatrical trailer which is presented in full HD.Overall, this is a pretty decent package for the money. While currently a Wal Mart exclusive going for around 10 dollars and selling for highly inflated prices elsewhere, ""A Fish Called Wanda"" is a true comedy classic. Yes, it could have been SO MUCH BETTER as far as the video quality goes, but with a very small amount of ""help"" you can coax a pretty good picture out of this disc.  I have seen much worse and for much more money.  I read some where that at best this disc resembles an upconverted DVD. I totally disagree with that assessment as there is NO WAY any DVD would have the detail this transfer sports.  While not 100% happy with this product, I am still very pleased with it and do not regret my purchase one bit.

But that is not an option in these Amazon reviews. I've watched this movie multiple times and it stays as funny as ever. The plot is absurd. A few scoundrels have cooked up a plan to rob a bank. John Cleese as a barrister mocks British formality better than just about anybody. Jamie Lee Curtis is both as funny and sexy here as she is in Trading Places. Of course she and Cleese fall in love. Very few actors could pull off the surreal insanity of Kevin Kline in this role.

406707,A1SHPX0VCXMRXT,6304196784,"Mr. S. A. Lukacs ""Simbob""","[1, 1]","A Fish Called Wanda may be crude, but it is really a romantic comedy in the old fashioned sense of the word. It contains all the neccesary romance elements: an unlikely couple (Cleese and Curtis); a love triangle (in this case a love hexagon); and just about the right amount of sentiment sprinkled in, But it also posseses a wicked sense of humour the perfectly balances and compliments the romance. In a way, something to please everyone.The old fashioned whimsy of the tale combined with a sense of the macabre is heightened by the presence of Charles Chichton, one time director of many of the similarily dark Ealing comedies who masterly handles this story of a jewell robbery aftermath, with all it's backstabbing and bed hopping. In fact, Wanda could very much be considered an eighties desendent of Ealing.The cast is sublime. Cleese gives his usual but still enigmatic stuffy British suit performance as barrister Archie Leach, brilliant in the early scenes where he is stuck in his stale upper class marriage with an uncaring wife and a spoilt daughter. As Leach, defending gangster George (Tom Georgeson) on robbery charges begins an affair with chief defence witness and George's girlfriend Wanda (A gorgeous Jamie Lee Curtis).Kevin Kline performs a comedy masterclass as the ignorant, philosophy reading, violent tempered Otto, Wanda's &quot;brother&quot;, and he seems to have a problem with any men that show his &quot;sister&quot; too much attention.But Kline is just pipped to show stealing honours by Michael Palin, as the stuttering, animal loving getaway driver Ken. He's George's best mate, and also fancies Wanda, but thinks Otto is gay... oh, and he has a fish that's also called Wanda, which Otto doesn't like. Confused? You won't be, as this near note-perfect comedy fits together piece by piece as all and sundry double cross each other, before reaching a happy climax.Delicious in every sense of the word.",5,Fishing for Compliments,1003276800,"10 17, 2001",2001,1932,"['Fish', 'Called', 'Wanda', 'may', 'be', 'crude', 'really', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'old', 'fashioned', 'sense', 'word', 'neccesary', 'romance', 'elements', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'Cleese', 'Curtis', 'love', 'triangle', 'case', 'love', 'hexagon', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'sentiment', 'sprinkled', 'also', 'wicked', 'sense', 'perfectly', 'balances', 'romance', 'way', 'something', 'please', 'everyone.The', 'old', 'fashioned', 'whimsy', 'tale', 'combined', 'sense', 'macabre', 'heightened', 'presence', 'Charles', 'Chichton', 'one', 'time', 'director', 'many', 'similarily', 'dark', 'Ealing', 'comedies', 'who', 'masterly', 'story', 'jewell', 'robbery', 'aftermath', 'backstabbing', 'bed', 'hopping', 'fact', 'Wanda', 'could', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'considered', 'eighties', 'desendent', 'Ealing.The', 'cast', 'sublime', 'Cleese', 'usual', 'still', 'enigmatic', 'stuffy', 'British', 'suit', 'performance', 'barrister', 'Archie', 'Leach', 'brilliant', 'early', 'scenes', 'where', 'stuck', 'stale', 'upper', 'class', 'marriage', 'uncaring', 'wife', 'spoilt', 'daughter', 'Leach', 'defending', 'gangster', 'George', 'Tom', 'Georgeson', 'robbery', 'charges', 'affair', 'chief', 'defence', 'witness', 'George', 'girlfriend', 'Wanda', 'A', 'gorgeous', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', '.Kevin', 'Kline', 'comedy', 'masterclass', 'ignorant', 'philosophy', 'reading', 'violent', 'tempered', 'Otto', 'Wanda', 'quot', 'quot', 'have', 'problem', 'men', 'show', 'quot', 'sister', 'quot', 'too', 'much', 'attention.But', 'Kline', 'just', 'pipped', 'show', 'stealing', 'honours', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'stuttering', 'animal', 'loving', 'getaway', 'driver', 'Ken', 'George', 'best', 'mate', 'also', 'fancies', 'Wanda', 'Otto', 'gay', 'oh', 'fish', 'also', 'called', 'Wanda', 'Otto', ""n't"", 'like', 'Confused', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'note-perfect', 'comedy', 'together', 'piece', 'piece', 'sundry', 'double', 'cross', 'other', 'reaching', 'happy', 'climax.Delicious', 'sense', 'word']",Fish Called Wanda VHS

Jamie Lee Curtis also has so much competition from her owncountless films, like ""Perfect"", that her other movies also overshadow Wanda. Kevin Klinehas made so many popular films that a lot of people don't know this Charles Chrichton flick.I don't previously know some of this other great supporting staff in A Fish Called Wanda. MichaelPalin should have been noticed for his stutter in the movie, which is an impressive acting feat.Some stutter for the camera better than others, and Palin has it down to an art.  So everyoneof the main characters including Palin is a criminal. Kline is  a crook, too, but he is also asadomasochistic type, with a bizzare and dangerous ego. Kline got Best Supporting Actor,but he always wins some kind of an award. It's just my opinion, but the awarded actorsseem to be in some kind of club.  Sophie's Choice probably put Kline in that club. I thoughtthat Palin deserved something, if not just for his zany revenge on someone with a steamroller.Cleese plays the barrister, an English attorney.

Cleese played British barrister, Archie Leach, who is enticed by Wanda Gurwitz. Wanda and Otto have even their partners conned into thinking that they're brother and sister as well. Michael Palin played stuttering Ken whose main mission is to off Ms. Coady played by the wonderful actress, Patricia Hayes. The film was written, produced, and co-directed by John Cleese and the late Charles Crichton.Anyway, the cast is first rate and the writing as well. The direction is brilliant. Of course, BAFTAs went to John Cleese (lead actor) and Michael Palin (supporting actor) and an Academy Award for Actor in a Supporting Role to Kevin Kline's unforgettable performance as Otto. In my opinion, Kline steals the film most of the time but they're all scene stealers. Kline's Otto believes he's smarter than everybody else especially the British. Jamie Lee Curtis is also unforgettable and believable as the woman who is crossing everybody else in the film for the jewels.The first CD is the film. The second CD is the special features which include the making of the film; a message from John Cleese when the film was released; Robert Powell exploring the locations where the film was shot; the inception and completion of the film; alternate and deleted scenes with John Cleese pointing them out.

406737,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,6304196784,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[2, 4]","This classic 1988 British comedy, which was written by and stars John Cleese (Fawlty Towers, Monty Python), has got to be one of the funniest films of all time, and it is certainly one of my favourites.Briefly, the story involves four criminals who steal a fortune in diamonds.  One ends up in prison (having been ratted on by two of his not-so-loyal mates); ironically, just prior to his arrest he had secretly taken the jewels and rehidden them.  So the film revolves around the attempts of the others to discover the location of the jewels.The plot is indeed a good one, but what really makes this film exceptional and so hilarious is the colourful cast of characters and the splendid performances of all involved.  There simply isn't one weak performance here.The central character is a beautiful and spirited American woman named Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), the lone female in the gang and the only intelligent one of the lot.  Wanda's one weakness, however, is her penchant for hearing foreign languages--it's something that really turns her on!  This makes for much hilarity between her and her fellow gangster, Otto (whom Wanda has been trying to pass off as her brother), as Otto rattles off every known Italian food dish, type of cheese, and so on, in his attempts to seduce Wanda.  Otto (Kevin Kline), by the way, is a highly paranoid, Nietzsche-reading yet empty-headed, Anglophobic, trigger-happy lunatic who thinks he's an intellectual and enjoys sniffing his armpits.  He's a flamboyant personality to say the least, and one which Kline manages to carry off wonderfully--I simply cannot imagine anyone doing a better job.  These two are the real powerhouses of the gang.Then there's poor Ken (Michael Palin (Monty Python)), who's an avid animal lover--a fact which provides the basis for some extremely funny scenes.  He's a humorously pathetic character--a little bit on the simple side with the worst stammer ever, and if  there's a show-stealer (and I say ""if"" for they're all so good), for me it's Ken.  He's simply hilarious, and the interplay between him and the nasty Otto is simply priceless.  (It's a bit like watching a cat relentlessly toying with a poor, helpless little mouse).  Lastly, one mustn't forget John Cleese, who portrays Archie, the rather reserved barrister representing George, the incarcerated gang member, and who, I just have to add, has Wanda in a fit of ecstasy (unbeknownst to himself) in one hilarious scene when he starts spouting Russian.In conclusion, the film (which has a running time of 108 minutes) is definitely a must-see for fans of British comedy or, for that matter, for anyone looking for a thoroughly entertaining not to mention hilarious film.  I've seen it a number of times and certainly don't regret purchasing it.  It's definitely one to watch and rewatch.  And if you've enjoyed the film, by all means check out Fawlty Towers (also co-written by and starring John Cleese and also featuring an abundance of visual humour).  You'll not regret it--it's simply one of the funniest shows ever made.  And so is this film!Very highly recommended!",5,One of the Funniest Films Ever!,1035590400,"10 26, 2002",2002,3105,"['classic', '1988', 'British', 'comedy', 'was', 'written', 'stars', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'Monty', 'Python', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'time', 'certainly', 'one', 'favourites.Briefly', 'story', 'four', 'criminals', 'who', 'steal', 'fortune', 'diamonds', 'One', 'up', 'prison', 'having', 'been', 'ratted', 'two', 'not-so-loyal', 'mates', 'ironically', 'just', 'prior', 'arrest', 'had', 'secretly', 'taken', 'jewels', 'rehidden', 'film', 'attempts', 'others', 'discover', 'location', 'jewels.The', 'plot', 'indeed', 'good', 'one', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'exceptional', 'so', 'hilarious', 'colourful', 'cast', 'characters', 'splendid', 'performances', 'involved', 'simply', ""n't"", 'one', 'weak', 'performance', 'here.The', 'central', 'character', 'beautiful', 'spirited', 'American', 'woman', 'named', 'Wanda', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'lone', 'female', 'gang', 'only', 'intelligent', 'one', 'lot', 'Wanda', 'one', 'weakness', 'however', 'penchant', 'hearing', 'foreign', 'languages', 'something', 'really', 'much', 'hilarity', 'fellow', 'gangster', 'Otto', 'whom', 'Wanda', 'been', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'brother', 'Otto', 'known', 'Italian', 'food', 'dish', 'type', 'cheese', 'so', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'Wanda', 'Otto', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'way', 'highly', 'paranoid', 'Nietzsche-reading', 'yet', 'empty-headed', 'Anglophobic', 'trigger-happy', 'lunatic', 'who', 'intellectual', 'sniffing', 'armpits', 'flamboyant', 'personality', 'say', 'least', 'one', 'Kline', 'carry', 'off', 'wonderfully', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'doing', 'better', 'job', 'two', 'are', 'real', 'powerhouses', 'gang.Then', 'poor', 'Ken', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'Monty', 'Python', 'who', 'avid', 'animal', 'lover', 'fact', 'basis', 'extremely', 'funny', 'scenes', 'humorously', 'pathetic', 'character', 'little', 'bit', 'simple', 'side', 'worst', 'stammer', 'ever', 'show-stealer', 'say', ""'re"", 'so', 'good', 'Ken', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'interplay', 'nasty', 'Otto', 'simply', 'priceless', 'bit', 'watching', 'cat', 'relentlessly', 'toying', 'poor', 'helpless', 'little', 'mouse', 'Lastly', 'must', ""n't"", 'forget', 'John', 'Cleese', 'who', 'Archie', 'rather', 'reserved', 'barrister', 'representing', 'George', 'incarcerated', 'gang', 'member', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'add', 'Wanda', 'fit', 'ecstasy', 'unbeknownst', 'one', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'when', 'spouting', 'Russian.In', 'conclusion', 'film', 'running', 'time', '108', 'minutes', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'fans', 'British', 'comedy', 'matter', 'anyone', 'looking', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'not', 'mention', 'hilarious', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'times', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'purchasing', 'definitely', 'one', 'watch', 'rewatch', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'film', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'also', 'co-written', 'starring', 'John', 'Cleese', 'also', 'featuring', 'abundance', 'visual', 'humour', ""'ll"", 'not', 'regret', 'simply', 'one', 'funniest', 'ever', 'made', 'so', 'film', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",Fish Called Wanda VHS
