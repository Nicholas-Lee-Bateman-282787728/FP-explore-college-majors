1496880,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B005OUL7OY,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[5, 6]","Failed, emotionally-depressed actor Grady (Ross Beschler) moves to the mountains of North Carolina to open a resort lodge, which isn't exactly welcomed by his neighbors.  He looks forward to visits from his friends, including former agent Karen (Claire Bowerman) and his long-distance boyfriend Andy (Michael Montgomery), and intends to ask Andy to move up there with him. A local young man, Beetle (David J. Bonner) is helping out at the resort temporarily, but his sweet, innocent Southern boy charm hides the reality of his bad intentions.It's a suspenseful, well-acted and directed story, very different from the usual gay festival fare, though a bit simplistic and predictable for a film of this genre.  Unfortunately, there are technical issues (sound so low it can barely be heard at maximum volume, and a ""screener"" warning across the picture that appears about an hour in - even though I bought my copy at retail!) that significantly reduces the ability to enjoy the film.  Not reflected in the rating, but FYI: There is really no gay content, other than two gay characters.  DVD extras include only a photo gallery, a music video and trailer.  I give it three stars out of five.",3,Creative suspense yarn falls flat in development and tech problems.,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1188,"['Failed', 'emotionally-depressed', 'actor', 'Grady', 'Ross', 'Beschler', 'mountains', 'North', 'Carolina', 'open', 'resort', 'lodge', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'welcomed', 'neighbors', 'forward', 'visits', 'friends', 'including', 'former', 'agent', 'Karen', 'Claire', 'Bowerman', 'long-distance', 'boyfriend', 'Andy', 'Michael', 'Montgomery', 'ask', 'Andy', 'move', 'up', 'there', 'local', 'young', 'man', 'Beetle', 'David', 'J.', 'Bonner', 'helping', 'out', 'resort', 'temporarily', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'Southern', 'boy', 'charm', 'reality', 'bad', 'intentions.It', 'suspenseful', 'well-acted', 'directed', 'story', 'very', 'different', 'usual', 'gay', 'festival', 'fare', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'predictable', 'film', 'genre', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'technical', 'issues', 'sound', 'so', 'low', 'can', 'barely', 'be', 'heard', 'maximum', 'volume', 'screener', 'warning', 'picture', 'hour', 'even', 'bought', 'copy', 'retail', 'significantly', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Not', 'reflected', 'rating', 'FYI', 'really', 'gay', 'content', 'other', 'two', 'gay', 'characters', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'only', 'photo', 'gallery', 'music', 'video', 'trailer', 'give', 'three', 'five']",Flight of the Cardinal
1496881,ATQFTT3JJNGRT,B005OUL7OY,Dennis Milam,"[5, 7]","This film is a very dark and twisting story, with a hidden evil character who is a perfectly nasty villain. The acting is strong ( with Matthew Montgomery in a supporting role, how could it not be ? ) and the script is smart. The actor who is the heavy did a very believable excellent job and the supporting cast was very good,  as was the lead actor. The set of the ( actual ) Appalachian resort lodge worked nicely as did the music. The slow uncovering of the hate-filled fundamentalism of one of the characters was handled effectively. Sometimes creepy to watch, it holds your interest.",4,dark but rewarding,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,589,"['film', 'very', 'dark', 'twisting', 'story', 'hidden', 'evil', 'character', 'who', 'perfectly', 'nasty', 'villain', 'acting', 'strong', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', 'supporting', 'role', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'script', 'smart', 'actor', 'who', 'heavy', 'did', 'very', 'believable', 'excellent', 'job', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'lead', 'actor', 'set', 'actual', 'Appalachian', 'resort', 'lodge', 'worked', 'nicely', 'did', 'music', 'slow', 'uncovering', 'hate-filled', 'fundamentalism', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'handled', 'effectively', 'Sometimes', 'creepy', 'watch', 'interest']",Flight of the Cardinal

It was entertaining and acted well by most of the actors.  It was good to see Matthew Montgomery in another film; however, his performance was not as great as it was in Redwoods, this was due in part to the weak story line I referred to earlier. A writer can truly enhance an actors performance if the story flows well and is believable.  It's a good movie and I won't put it at the bottom of my collection.
