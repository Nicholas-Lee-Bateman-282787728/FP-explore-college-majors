Matthew Turnbull is a poor, handsome carpenter who falls in  love with Cissie and helps her - but Matthew must choose between his love  for her and the need to support his elderly parents (in short, marry for  love or marry for money).Cissie is raped by a drunken, young aristocrat  (Clive Fischel) and soon finds herself in a custody battle with Lord  Fischel - the grandfather of her child. Clive returns from banishment at  sea a changed man and vows to &quot;set things right&quot; with Cissie.You'll have to find out for yourself how this all ends...but rest  assured you will be on the edge of your seat and engrossed from beginning  to end!

After all the rich people had done to Cissie and she is in love with the man who raped her!I know it was the evil sister who mostly caused all the grief.. And it leaves it hanging with never knowing whether the rich guy returns or not..The other man who claimed to love her..well he loved money more, when he could have married her...yet he chose The Mill and the woman who went with it. The story was good, but mixed up to me and cause of the ending..I will not watch it again.",3,What?!,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,540,"['just', 'watched', 'film', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'liking', 'rich', 'people', 'had', 'done', 'Cissie', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'raped', 'know', 'was', 'evil', 'sister', 'who', 'mostly', 'caused', 'grief..', 'hanging', 'never', 'knowing', 'rich', 'guy', 'returns', 'not..The', 'other', 'man', 'who', 'claimed', 'love', 'her..well', 'loved', 'money', 'more', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'married', 'yet', 'chose', 'Mill', 'woman', 'who', 'went', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'mixed', 'up', 'cause', 'ending..I', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'again']",Catherine Cookson's The Dwelling Place VHS

Refusing to allow her siblings to go to the workhouse she instead takes them to live in a cave on the Northumbrian moor. Helped by the man who loves her, Cissie's brave struggle to make a home for herself and for her siblings is the essence of what the dwelling place is all about.I found this romance very intriguing. Cissie has two suitors, and many adventures and tragedies which threaten to shatter her happiness. The scenery is beautiful and the story is wild and unpredictable.I recommend this for fans of historical drama. 5 abundant stars.",5,Could not stop watching,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,611,"['Cissie', 'Brodie', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'parents', 'die', 'Cholera', 'Refusing', 'allow', 'siblings', 'go', 'workhouse', 'instead', 'live', 'cave', 'Northumbrian', 'moor', 'Helped', 'man', 'who', 'Cissie', 'brave', 'struggle', 'make', 'home', 'herself', 'siblings', 'essence', 'what', 'dwelling', 'place', 'about.I', 'found', 'romance', 'very', 'intriguing', 'Cissie', 'two', 'suitors', 'many', 'adventures', 'tragedies', 'threaten', 'shatter', 'happiness', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'story', 'wild', 'unpredictable.I', 'recommend', 'fans', 'historical', 'drama', '5', 'abundant', 'stars']",Catherine Cookson's The Dwelling Place VHS
373600,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,6303421148,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[1, 1]","Catherine Cookson's The Dwelling Place left a bland taste in my mouth.  The story of hardship for a young girl and her siblings after the death of her parents is moving enough.  The man who supposedly loves and cares for her marries another woman for her father's money as a miller.  Not exactly riches.  He confesses his undying love and is frankly a jerk.  Cissy, who has a baby out of wedlock, after the landowner's son rapes her, eventually gives up the child to the family.  I thought that a bit unlikely that a rich landlord would want a bastard son to raise, but the story played upon his disgust over his son's actions.  To top if off, the son is responsible for the accidental death of his sister, which is subsequently hidden rather than confessing what actually happened.  She eventually rewards her raper by falling in love with him, another jerk in my opinion, in the end.  Even her own son doesn't love her.  The only redeeming quality in the story was her determination to take care of the family after the death of their parents rather than have them all shipped off to the poor house.  Frankly, the plot didn't sit well with me, and the ending left me cold.",2,Not the Most Intriguing of Stories,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,1174,"['Catherine', 'Cookson', 'Dwelling', 'Place', 'left', 'bland', 'taste', 'mouth', 'story', 'hardship', 'young', 'girl', 'siblings', 'death', 'parents', 'moving', 'enough', 'man', 'who', 'supposedly', 'cares', 'marries', 'woman', 'father', 'money', 'miller', 'Not', 'exactly', 'riches', 'undying', 'love', 'frankly', 'jerk', 'Cissy', 'who', 'baby', 'wedlock', 'landowner', 'son', 'eventually', 'up', 'child', 'family', 'thought', 'bit', 'unlikely', 'rich', 'landlord', 'would', 'want', 'bastard', 'son', 'raise', 'story', 'played', 'disgust', 'son', 'actions', 'top', 'off', 'son', 'responsible', 'accidental', 'death', 'sister', 'subsequently', 'hidden', 'rather', 'confessing', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'eventually', 'raper', 'falling', 'love', 'jerk', 'opinion', 'end', 'Even', 'own', 'son', ""n't"", 'love', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'story', 'was', 'determination', 'take', 'care', 'family', 'death', 'parents', 'rather', 'have', 'shipped', 'off', 'poor', 'house', 'Frankly', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'ending', 'left', 'cold']",Catherine Cookson's The Dwelling Place VHS
