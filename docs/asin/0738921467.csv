I  loved  this special  when I was a kid,  liked the story. the jokes and the one liners , gags, music and good lessons that were in this show,also it got  me interested in history, art and things  that had to with Egypt  history and  culture and you saw that people aren't really that different. only in ethic background and upbringing, but that each one of  us can be  friends and share things in common as a whole, that's what I took away from it anyway.I Do wish  that this  special gets a proper release soon from CTW, this is  quite shameful guys because Big Bird In  China is available so are  all the others including the classic Christmas Eve on Sesame Street. So what's up with the hold up on this  one? This one is a milestone along with the Christmas Eve special, so let Don't Eat the Pictures see the  light of  day okay!  I'd like to purchase this title someday.I've been searching for this for quite sometime, only remember the story and not the title and ran across this  in my search of the Christmas eve special  thank goodness for  that. :) I actually bought the Christmas eve special and again i plan on buying this title when it is available for purchase,just a reminder CTW.I laugh at  people that think this special is  evil , far from it. Only total morons would believe that ,it's a great special for kids as I have said  before above in my comments.  I hope  someday CTW will see the follies of they're ways and release this classic title Long Live Don't Eat the Pictures.Highly Recommended Title For Kids.",5,A Sesame Street Classic Not On DVD?

1965,A4Z17Z22NLYTP,0738921467,Kelley A. Bergamo,"[0, 0]","I first saw this film back in 1983. I must have been about seven. I remember when it first premiered on PBS (Channel 11 in Chicago, where I grew up). My sister and I were allowed to stay up late on a Sunday night just to watch it. Then I didn't see it again for many years until I found it for sale on Amazon.It's such a cute video. The adults of Sesame Street take Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, and some of the kids to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Just as the museum is about to close, Big Bird says that Snuffy was supposed to meet him. Of course this draws a lot of moans and groans from the adults, as Snuffy wouldn't make his debut for two more years. Big Bird sneaks away to find Snuffy just as the museum is closing! It becomes a game of cat and mouse as the night guard is sure that something weird is going on and the gang just slips by him. But the biggest story is that Snuffy and Big Bird meet an ancient Egyptian prince named Sahou. Sahou has been trying to get into Heaven for 3,000 years but he can't because he can't answer a riddle. Big Bird and Snuffy come to the rescue to come up with the answer.There are also some cute little songs in here, like ""Mothers and Children,"" sung by Olivia, ""Don't eat the Pictures,"" done by Cookie Monster and the Girls, and ""You'll get Home Soon,"" by Big Bird and Sahou. I liked this video and I plan to share it with my own children someday because it opens up the world of art appreciation to them. Very well done.

I am a grandmother and remembered how much my children, one of which is now a professional artist, loved this. I was not wrong.

She is frightened by the wizard and cried when Sahu goes to his parents; she didn't understand why he went away, but would just come get us to sit with her for that part.

Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney, this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift, but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl, and keep hoping that it will be released.One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace.
