1519199,AB0GGIQBNB36Q,B006QVRW2G,Ben Milton,"[10, 13]","I just finished watching this documentary, and I have to say I was alittle dissapointed. When the movie begins, their focus is to map the entire wreck site. That's fine, until they find pieces in the map, that no one has ever seen before. And that leads to the talk of the breakup of the ship, and like a previous reviewer said, they repeat alot of the information, and it's treated like CSI Titanic, they even say that during the ""Investigation"". For instance, Park Stevens is going to test the popping of the rivets during the collision. So they get some 100 year old steel, and make some rivets. And then they apply some pressure to the steel and the rivets, nothing happens, but what they forgot to do, was take that test further, and actually submerge the steel in the same water temp. That the titanic's steel was in that night, the water temp that night was 28 degrees farenheit. And it's also common knowledge, that the Titanic's steel had a high sulfure content, and was full of fissures, and became extremely brittle at those low temps. Buut no, lets just do a test at room temp. As my wife said, ""if we're to go by that test, then the accident wouldn't of happened"". And she's right, also. Captain is let off the hook at the end, ""he was just doing what other captains of that time were doing"". Never mind the fact, that he is ultimately responsible for everybody on the ship. Because he's the captain, Bruce Ismay also gets a pass. Thomas Andrews, well you can't blame him. He's dead, and they actually say at the end that Titanic has gotten a bad rap. But that they proved that, the Titanic proved herself. And the accident was just a series of unfortunate events, and that nobody is to blame. i disagree, captain smith had plenty of Ice warnings, he should have slowed down, Bruce Ismay shouldn't have pressured smith to go so fast. And yes, the quality of steel was terrible. This documentary left alot to be desired, the ""Titanic's final moments: Missing pieces"" documentary is much much much better than this.",3,It's nobody's fault,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2026,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'documentary', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'alittle', 'dissapointed', 'When', 'movie', 'focus', 'map', 'entire', 'wreck', 'site', 'fine', 'find', 'pieces', 'map', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'talk', 'breakup', 'ship', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'said', 'repeat', 'alot', 'information', 'treated', 'CSI', 'Titanic', 'even', 'say', 'Investigation', 'instance', 'Park', 'Stevens', 'going', 'test', 'popping', 'rivets', 'collision', 'get', '100', 'year', 'old', 'steel', 'make', 'rivets', 'then', 'apply', 'pressure', 'steel', 'rivets', 'nothing', 'happens', 'what', 'forgot', 'do', 'was', 'take', 'test', 'further', 'actually', 'submerge', 'steel', 'same', 'water', 'temp', 'titanic', 'steel', 'was', 'night', 'water', 'temp', 'night', 'was', '28', 'degrees', 'farenheit', 'also', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Titanic', 'steel', 'had', 'high', 'sulfure', 'content', 'was', 'full', 'fissures', 'became', 'extremely', 'brittle', 'low', 'temps', 'Buut', 'just', 'do', 'test', 'room', 'temp', 'wife', 'said', ""'re"", 'go', 'test', 'then', 'accident', 'would', ""n't"", 'happened', 'right', 'also', 'Captain', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'other', 'captains', 'time', 'were', 'doing', 'Never', 'mind', 'fact', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'everybody', 'ship', 'captain', 'Bruce', 'Ismay', 'also', 'pass', 'Thomas', 'Andrews', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'dead', 'actually', 'say', 'end', 'Titanic', 'gotten', 'bad', 'rap', 'proved', 'Titanic', 'proved', 'accident', 'was', 'just', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'nobody', 'blame', 'i', 'disagree', 'captain', 'smith', 'had', 'plenty', 'Ice', 'warnings', 'should', 'have', 'slowed', 'down', 'Bruce', 'Ismay', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'pressured', 'smith', 'go', 'so', 'fast', 'yes', 'quality', 'steel', 'was', 'terrible', 'documentary', 'left', 'alot', 'be', 'desired', 'Titanic', 'final', 'moments', 'Missing', 'pieces', 'documentary', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'better']",Titanic At 100: Mystery Solved

1519202,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B006QVRW2G,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[0, 1]","On April 14, 1912, the RMS Titanic struck an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  Over 1500 people lost their lives.  In 1985, Robert Ballard became the first person to discover the wreck of the Titanic.  In the years since Ballard's discovery, over twenty expeditions have been conducted.  In this History Channel documentary, another recent expedition to the Titanic was conducted with the purpose of mapping the entire wreck site.With the use of high-tech equipment, the entire wreck site was mapped.  Many objects, including the missing sections near where the ship broke, were discovered.  Myths were dispelled as well.  For instance, it has been thought that weak rivets caused plates to separate which led to the sinking.  A stress test conducted on rivets designed to exactly match the ones on Titanic proved that the rivets held.  It was the consensus of the members of the expedition that Titanic was a sturdy and well-built ship.  The virtual hangar used by the members allowed them to see the Titanic in 3D.I found this documentary to be informative and well-done.  The members of the expedition succeeded in their mission to map the entire wreck site while dispelling some rumors along the way.  The virtual 3D hangar was interesting to see, and the historical tie-ins were well-done.I recommend ""Titanic at 100"" to people who are interested in the Titanic and to those who enjoy interesting documentaries.

1519203,A206W865BATCDG,B006QVRW2G,John Barry Kenyon,"[10, 13]","This new DVD debunks a number of theories why the Titanic sank so quickly - well, in two hours forty minutes actually.  It wasn't the fault of builder Thomas Andrews' design, nor the rivets holding the iron plates which were fine. Certainly it wasn't not the badness of the White Star line which provided more lifeboats than was required by law.  The DVD provides never-before-seen evidence from the 18 square mile debris field to create a state-of-the-art imaging technology to puit together again the complete Titanic.  Basically if you like CGI you'll love this programme.At the end of the day, the underwater team concludes that Titanic broke in two on the surface simply because the pressure on metal was too great.  No man-made structure could have withstood that.  So there are no villains, simply the inevitable break-up on the surface.  You have to remember that the Titanic sustained more underwater damage on striking the iceberg than any other big vessel in a collision in the whole of maritime history. Although the programme is thorough and presented as a detective story, howbeit repetitive in places, the overall conclusion is the obvious one.  Titanic had too much underwater damage to avoid breaking up and sinking. No need for scapegoats.  Incidentally, the documentary uses a lot of stock footage crowd-scenes from the 1958 movie A Night to Remember.  It's good but hardly revolutionary.",3,Don't blame the rivets,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,1407,"['new', 'DVD', 'number', 'theories', 'why', 'Titanic', 'sank', 'so', 'quickly', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'forty', 'minutes', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'builder', 'Thomas', 'Andrews', 'design', 'rivets', 'holding', 'iron', 'plates', 'were', 'fine', 'Certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'not', 'badness', 'White', 'Star', 'line', 'provided', 'more', 'lifeboats', 'was', 'required', 'law', 'DVD', 'never-before-seen', 'evidence', '18', 'square', 'mile', 'debris', 'field', 'create', 'state-of-the-art', 'imaging', 'technology', 'puit', 'together', 'again', 'complete', 'Titanic', 'Basically', 'like', 'CGI', ""'ll"", 'love', 'end', 'day', 'underwater', 'team', 'Titanic', 'broke', 'two', 'surface', 'simply', 'pressure', 'metal', 'was', 'too', 'great', 'man-made', 'structure', 'could', 'have', 'withstood', 'are', 'villains', 'simply', 'inevitable', 'break-up', 'surface', 'have', 'remember', 'Titanic', 'sustained', 'more', 'underwater', 'damage', 'striking', 'iceberg', 'other', 'big', 'vessel', 'collision', 'whole', 'maritime', 'history', 'programme', 'thorough', 'presented', 'detective', 'story', 'howbeit', 'repetitive', 'places', 'overall', 'conclusion', 'obvious', 'one', 'Titanic', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'underwater', 'damage', 'avoid', 'breaking', 'up', 'sinking', 'need', 'scapegoats', 'Incidentally', 'documentary', 'lot', 'stock', 'footage', 'crowd-scenes', '1958', 'movie', 'Night', 'Remember', 'good', 'hardly', 'revolutionary']",Titanic At 100: Mystery Solved

1519205,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B006QVRW2G,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[4, 6]","'Titanic at 100' begins with an effort to map the Titanic's 15-square-mile debris field, followed by examination of whether the ship sank because of weak rivets and/or a design flaw that allowed a seam to open too easily. Unfortunately, the program is built around the expectation of 30-some minutes of advertisements encapsulated within 90-some minutes of actual program and the narration includes constant repetition of these goals and accomplishments to that point after every advertising break point. (Thus, the total impact of the ads is much greater than the 30-minutes that they would have consumed in a normal broadcast.)Another aggravation - too much time was spent talking, not enough viewing pieces of the Titanic. Further, the Titanic scenes were too closely focused (probably because of lighting limitations) to allow much ability to understand what was being shown. Finally, though not germane to the explorers purpose, there were no interior shots whatsoever - those would have been extremely interesting.Why so much time was spent wondering why the Titanic broke apart near the stern is another mystery. Whether it did or did not had no bearing on the ultimate outcome. (I'm also wondering who paid for all this exploration and subsequent analysis.)Anyway, their analyses convinced them that there were no design flaws, but somehow in their opinion the Captain wasn't guilty of speeding either - even though it was impossible to see icebergs by waves beating against their sides. Nor was the builder guilty of insufficient lifeboats.
