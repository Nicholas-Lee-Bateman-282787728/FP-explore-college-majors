855889,A13DD17X1AZFGJ,B0006212UY,A. Butterfield,"[0, 0]","N&oacute;i Albin&oacute;i is the story of a young man out of place in his small town life. He's a genius, but the type that everybody thinks is really an idiot. He's just under stimulated.The film is a series of incidents and scenes, often amusing, usually quirky. For instance, I like the scene where N&oacute;i's schoolfriend brings a tape recorder and places it on N&oacute;i's desk. When the teacher asks, the friend explains that N&oacute;i couldn't make it that day. Or the part when N&oacute;i discovers his grandmother playing the violin in the wardrobe to avoid disturbing her dead husband.This is the sort of thing you can expect. There isn't much of a story as such. But the ending is unexpected and unsettling.Fans of Icelandic culture will be happy (although as the director explains, this is in no way meant to be a realistic portrayal of life in Iceland), and you'll see some nice snowy landscapes. But the star of the film by a big margin is N&oacute;i himself, brilliantly played with great understatement. An albino he is not, but he looks different enough for this detail not to matter.The film is paced slow, but not boringly so. It is full of detail and undercurrents of meaning. I liked it a lot. It leaves an impression.The DVD has plenty of extras, like interviews with a very nervous seeming director, and scenes that he cut out.",4,Curious Icelandic film leaves an impression,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1354,"['N', 'oacute', 'Albin', 'oacute', 'i', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'genius', 'type', 'everybody', 'really', 'idiot', 'just', 'stimulated.The', 'film', 'series', 'incidents', 'scenes', 'often', 'amusing', 'usually', 'quirky', 'instance', 'like', 'scene', 'where', 'N', 'oacute', 'i', 'schoolfriend', 'tape', 'recorder', 'places', 'N', 'oacute', 'i', 'desk', 'When', 'teacher', 'friend', 'N', 'oacute', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'day', 'part', 'when', 'N', 'oacute', 'i', 'discovers', 'grandmother', 'playing', 'violin', 'wardrobe', 'avoid', 'disturbing', 'dead', 'husband.This', 'sort', 'thing', 'can', 'expect', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'such', 'ending', 'unexpected', 'unsettling.Fans', 'Icelandic', 'culture', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'director', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'life', 'Iceland', ""'ll"", 'see', 'nice', 'snowy', 'landscapes', 'star', 'film', 'big', 'margin', 'N', 'oacute', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'great', 'understatement', 'albino', 'not', 'different', 'enough', 'detail', 'not', 'matter.The', 'film', 'paced', 'slow', 'not', 'boringly', 'so', 'full', 'detail', 'undercurrents', 'meaning', 'liked', 'lot', 'impression.The', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'extras', 'interviews', 'very', 'nervous', 'seeming', 'director', 'scenes', 'cut', 'out']",Noi

Why? N&oacute;i is a teenager living in Bolungarv&iacute;k, in the far northwest of Iceland. He wants to leave because he feels foreign to everything around him, and a picture of a cuban beach in the caribbean confirms to him that ""there's more to life than this"", like one of Bj&ouml;rk's songs goes. He finds motivation when he meets &Iacute;ris, with whom he decides to leave. Up until now, it sounds like your average teenage film, but it's the mood set by the scarcely populated village, the sparse music, the boring life led by the local villagers what makes you sympathize with N&oacute;i and, ultimately, feel like him, when the movie ends.

He is rebellious on a personal level regarding school and his personal habits, he smokes and drinks. He is not exactly disrespectful but simply is an individual who follows his own inclinations which has a tendency to get him into trouble. The fjord in Iceland where he lives is limited ... His father is an alcoholic and there is no background given regarding his mother. The film contrasts the stark cold climate in which he lives with the emotional disconnection he feels on the whole about life. Noi feels constrained, he wants something else but does not see a way out. The film explores his personal behavior and how it affects those around him ... It is a deep and haunting film which has an unexpected shake-up type ending. However the ending is open-ended. It leaves the viewer hanging, to ponder how Noi may use the experience to grow into maturity and adulthood or it may be the curve which drives him into the depths of despair. Whichever path he chooses, the event which happened will seriously affect him for the remainder of his life ...Before this disastrous event, he challenges authority and gets involved with petty crime. He meets an attractive girl named Iris, who is visiting her father from the south of Iceland. It seems she needs to get away from city life according to her father. She jokes about wanting to leave Iceland and explore the world. Noi takes her litterally, walking together one night, he breaks the glass door to the local museum where they nearly get caught by the guards. They find an interactive map which lets them see what different parts of the world are like ... After this date, he buys new clothes, steals a car, and goes to meet Iris, challenging her to make a break with him. She sees the absurdity of this action and can't believe he took her seriously ... His brother bails him out of jail ... Prior to this, he was expelled from school for playing hookey too often. Just when it seems Noi has reached the end of his rope, a turning point, disaster strikes, his world is shaken up and nearly destroyed. This is a haunting and existential film which explores the depths of one lonely teenager's life ... and makes him face the realities of life.

855896,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,B0006212UY,Jay Young,"[0, 0]","Noi is definitely one of the most original movies I've seen, even if it's not completely to my taste. It's about the eponymous title character, a troubled youth looking for a way to make sense of his life. Noi lives with his grandmother and alcoholic father. He rarely goes to school, and consistently does poorly on his assignments. Nothing seems to go right for our anti-hero, as he has a bad relationship with his father, and is eventually expelled from school. His only window of hope is the new girl at the gas station, Iris, who he clearly takes an affection to. Noi's attempts to find a way out of his boring life become so desparate that he may only destroy his life in the process. In the end, he faces an uncertain future after a tragic event, which I will not reveal here. Suffice it to say that the ending offers hope, but hardly makes everything right.""Noi"" is a real treat for fans of European cinemas. It has great acting (though I didn't believe for a minute that T&oacute;mas Lemarquis was 17, as Noi is supposed to be) and a non-cliched script. Plus, it gives a ""slice of life"" picture of Iceland, a place that most Americans know very little about. In addition, ""Noi"" is an interesting take on the coming of age genre, and handles alcoholism and domestic violence in a surprisingly realistic manner. Furthermore, ""Noi"" reminds me of ""Five Easy Pieces"" in that it features a title character trying to make sense out of an apparently senseless life. The only caveat is that there are no real significant events, unless you want to count what happens at the end, and so someone expecting a drama in the vein of ""Lives of Others"" will be disappointed. It's really a character study.

Zwick,"[15, 16]","In the spare and poetic ""Noi the Albino,"" the title character is a seventeen-year-old gifted underachiever who lives with his grandmother in a dreary little village on the coast of northern Iceland.  This would be a harsh, isolated environment for anyone to grow up in, but it is particularly trying for a misfit adolescent with few social skills and no real hope for the future.  Noi, whose generally aloof, alcoholic father lives on his own in a different part of town, spends most of his time trudging purposelessly through the snowy streets of the village or holing up in the basement room he's carved out for himself as a kind of sanctuary from a world too utterly depressing to contemplate.  Bored by school and bereft of friends, this young man drifts through life, dreaming of the day when he will be able to live on a very different kind of island in the South Seas, a location light years removed from this place where the interiors are every bit as stark and forbidding as the white-on-white world outside.""Noi the Albino"" is one of those films in which the very lack of anything significant happening becomes the central theme and message of the work.  Noi lives a life that is so uneventful and boring that it would drive virtually any one of us to the brink of madness.  We hardly blame him when we see him dozing through his classes at school or pilfering change from a mock slot machine set up in the local restaurant.  Yet, despite the fact that virtually nothing of consequence happens, the film itself is a fascinating mood piece that seeps into our bones and makes us sympathize with the plight of the strange young man who occupies center stage in the drama.  Most of the adults in Noi's life seem to sense his potential, but, for some reason, he is totally unwilling to tap into it.  What's impressive about the film is that it doesn't try to explain why that is, though we sense it has something to do with the stifling environment in which he lives.  Noi becomes emblematic of all people who lead lives of quiet desperation, tucked away in remote, virtually uninhabitable corners of the globe, far removed from the bustle and excitement that can be found only in places with large and diverse populations.As Noi, Tomas Lemarquis gives a beautiful, subtle performance, creating a compelling and complex character using little more than body language and facial expressions.  The final moments of the film are truly heartbreaking as Noi learns the value of what he has - even though, at that point, the realization comes too late.Written and directed by Dagur Kari with an artist's eye for lyricism and austerity, this is a bleak but intriguing little film that will stay in your mind long past the closing credits.",4,haunting tale of a bored teenager,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,2737,"['spare', 'poetic', 'Noi', 'Albino', 'title', 'character', 'seventeen-year-old', 'gifted', 'underachiever', 'who', 'grandmother', 'dreary', 'little', 'village', 'coast', 'northern', 'Iceland', 'would', 'be', 'harsh', 'isolated', 'environment', 'anyone', 'grow', 'up', 'particularly', 'trying', 'misfit', 'adolescent', 'few', 'social', 'skills', 'real', 'hope', 'future', 'Noi', 'generally', 'aloof', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'lives', 'own', 'different', 'part', 'town', 'most', 'time', 'trudging', 'purposelessly', 'snowy', 'streets', 'village', 'holing', 'up', 'basement', 'room', 'carved', 'out', 'kind', 'sanctuary', 'world', 'too', 'utterly', 'depressing', 'contemplate', 'Bored', 'school', 'bereft', 'friends', 'young', 'man', 'drifts', 'life', 'dreaming', 'day', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'island', 'South', 'Seas', 'location', 'light', 'years', 'removed', 'place', 'where', 'interiors', 'are', 'bit', 'stark', 'forbidding', 'white-on-white', 'world', 'Noi', 'Albino', 'one', 'films', 'very', 'lack', 'anything', 'significant', 'happening', 'central', 'theme', 'message', 'work', 'Noi', 'life', 'so', 'uneventful', 'boring', 'would', 'drive', 'virtually', 'one', 'brink', 'madness', 'hardly', 'blame', 'when', 'see', 'dozing', 'classes', 'school', 'pilfering', 'change', 'mock', 'slot', 'machine', 'set', 'up', 'local', 'restaurant', 'fact', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'consequence', 'happens', 'film', 'fascinating', 'mood', 'piece', 'bones', 'sympathize', 'plight', 'strange', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'center', 'stage', 'drama', 'Most', 'adults', 'Noi', 'life', 'seem', 'sense', 'potential', 'reason', 'totally', 'unwilling', 'tap', 'What', 'impressive', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'sense', 'something', 'do', 'stifling', 'environment', 'Noi', 'emblematic', 'people', 'who', 'lead', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'tucked', 'away', 'remote', 'virtually', 'uninhabitable', 'corners', 'globe', 'far', 'removed', 'bustle', 'excitement', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'only', 'places', 'large', 'diverse', 'populations.As', 'Noi', 'Tomas', 'Lemarquis', 'beautiful', 'subtle', 'performance', 'creating', 'compelling', 'complex', 'character', 'using', 'little', 'more', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'heartbreaking', 'Noi', 'value', 'what', 'even', 'point', 'realization', 'too', 'late.Written', 'directed', 'Dagur', 'Kari', 'artist', 'eye', 'lyricism', 'austerity', 'bleak', 'intriguing', 'little', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'mind', 'long', 'closing', 'credits']",Noi
855902,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B0006212UY,Timothy Kearney,"[9, 9]","Boston's Museum of Fine Arts showed the film NOI ALBINOD a while back, and it looked intriguing, but I missed it and had to wait until the DVD release. Now that I have had the chance to view it, I found it a curious mixture of comedy and heartache and highly original. The film tells the story of an alienated youth who is misunderstood by those around him, a familiar enough genre, but it tells the story in a fresh way. The film's setting is a small town in Iceland and is probably what we would stereotypically think of small town life in this region of the world. It is cold all the time, there is plenty of snow on the ground, and the overall atmosphere is bleak. Noi is someone we would expect to meet in such a town. He may have dreams larger than his community, but we do not see evidence of it though we would not be surprised if this is the case. I'm not sure it's all that easy to sympathize with Noi, but in many ways this is why the film is so masterful. Noi is disconnected from the world and the filmmaker makes the viewer feel his disconnection. His lovable, but somewhat daft grandmother is the only caring figure in his life and has the responsibility of raising him. His father is drunk most of the time and an overall loser. The closest thing to a mentor in his life is a used bookstore owner who believes Keirkegaard is worthless. He has a daughter Iris who is Noi's love interest. There is no real plotline, and the film does end on a tragic note.There are also small humorous touches in the film, especially around the food Noi eats. He cannot successfully rob a bank or escape from the police. Iris' father wears a t-shirt that says ""New York F***ing City"" is also an amusing detail.NOI ALBINOD is probably not a film I will watch over and over again, but it is a movie that captures a viewer's interest and makes a person think.Enjoy!",4,An Interesting Example of Icelandic Cinema,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,1859,"['Boston', 'Museum', 'Fine', 'Arts', 'showed', 'film', 'NOI', 'ALBINOD', 'while', 'back', 'looked', 'intriguing', 'missed', 'had', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release', 'Now', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'view', 'found', 'curious', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'heartache', 'highly', 'original', 'film', 'story', 'alienated', 'youth', 'who', 'misunderstood', 'familiar', 'enough', 'genre', 'story', 'fresh', 'way', 'film', 'setting', 'small', 'town', 'Iceland', 'probably', 'what', 'would', 'stereotypically', 'think', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'region', 'world', 'cold', 'time', 'plenty', 'snow', 'ground', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'bleak', 'Noi', 'someone', 'would', 'expect', 'meet', 'such', 'town', 'may', 'have', 'dreams', 'larger', 'community', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'evidence', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'case', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'Noi', 'many', 'ways', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'masterful', 'Noi', 'disconnected', 'world', 'filmmaker', 'viewer', 'feel', 'disconnection', 'lovable', 'somewhat', 'daft', 'grandmother', 'only', 'caring', 'figure', 'life', 'responsibility', 'raising', 'father', 'drunk', 'most', 'time', 'overall', 'loser', 'closest', 'thing', 'mentor', 'life', 'used', 'bookstore', 'owner', 'who', 'Keirkegaard', 'worthless', 'daughter', 'Iris', 'who', 'Noi', 'love', 'interest', 'real', 'plotline', 'film', 'end', 'tragic', 'note.There', 'are', 'also', 'small', 'humorous', 'touches', 'film', 'especially', 'food', 'Noi', 'eats', 'can', 'not', 'successfully', 'rob', 'bank', 'escape', 'police', 'Iris', 'father', 't-shirt', 'New', 'York', 'F***ing', 'City', 'also', 'amusing', 'detail.NOI', 'ALBINOD', 'probably', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'movie', 'viewer', 'interest', 'person', 'think.Enjoy']",Noi
855903,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,B0006212UY,V.C.,"[2, 2]","Noi is truly one of those films that intentionally has a purpose to make you ambivalent and get mixed feelings about the character and the story itself. And it's also one of those films that is intentionally slow so that you can actually relate to how the character feels. It doesn't hinder the plot or dig holes in it, everything that the film shows on the screen has a purpose, regardless if it may seem pointless or flat on the surface. Everything from the very stark scenery of Iceland, the dull depiction of the environment, and the sometimes strange characters is meant to shock, amaze, and surprise us. This is real filmmaking. Although the director didn't intentionally make a realistic depiction of Iceland, you can still somewhat admire the ethereal and strange aurora that is emitted on the screen. If only most films were this original, unique, and artistic. What's also great about this film are the DVD extras, a great bonus to such a very haunting and profound film!
