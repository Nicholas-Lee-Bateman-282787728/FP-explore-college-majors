1688070,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00HEM9PW6,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","&#34;In Fear&#34; immediately introduces its audience to the fact that Tom and Lucy are about to be screwed no matter what they do. They lose their GPS signal, they decide to stay in the middle of nowhere, they're practically lead down their own downward spiral, and the finishing blow is losing their cell phone reception. You can see and feel the common threads of similar films in &#34;In Fear&#34; and yet it's still able to make its mark as far as atmosphere goes. The woods are a creepy place, especially at night, and &#34;In Fear&#34; capitalizes on that. The majority of the film takes place in Tom's car much like most of &#34;Saw&#34; took place in that one bathroom more than anything else. Not knowing what's out there is what causes the most tension; the rustling of leaves right before darkness hits, Lucy's hair being pulled, and Tom's car alarm going off for seemingly no reason. Tom and Lucy find themselves weaving down these winding and disorienting country roads while there is this impending sense of unknown perfectly established in the first half hour of the film, but naturally the film falls apart when it attempts to reveal its secluded horror.The film begins to wobble around the time tree branches begin scratching the car as Tom takes one too many swigs of alcohol while driving. A tree almost falls on them and a scarecrow spooks Lucy before someone in a mask lurks in the shadows while watching Tom urinate. You expect to get some answers by the time Max (Allen Leech) is introduced, but the character only makes things more confusing. It's very obvious where the Max character is going but his actions are just baffling, especially the entire fumbling around in the mud scene. You're given a face to who is causing everything, but nothing is ever really explained. It's as if it all comes back to the spilled drink at the pub at the beginning of the film. Did the other guy spill it? Did Tom spill it? Who bought who a round of drinks to keep the peace? The point of the matter is you don't really care.There are traces of films such as &#34;The Hitcher,&#34; &#34;House of 1000 Corpses,&#34; &#34;Joy Ride,&#34; and &#34;Hush&#34; wrapped up in the DNA of &#34;In Fear,&#34; but unfortunately that DNA is more of a clone than its own identity. There's no story and no purpose, so naturally it doesn't feel very gratifying. The ending leaves you on the verge of being infuriated since it's basically a one-sided game of cat and mouse with the cat obviously having the upper hand and the mouse not having any sort of chance whatsoever. &#34;In Fear&#34; is a promising thriller early on, but buckles under the tension it creates and leaves the viewer in a haze.",2,A white knuckled letdown,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,2693,"['34', 'Fear', '34', 'immediately', 'audience', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Lucy', 'are', 'be', 'screwed', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'lose', 'GPS', 'signal', 'decide', 'stay', 'middle', 'nowhere', ""'re"", 'practically', 'lead', 'down', 'own', 'downward', 'spiral', 'finishing', 'blow', 'losing', 'cell', 'phone', 'reception', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'common', 'threads', 'similar', 'films', '34', 'Fear', '34', 'still', 'able', 'make', 'mark', 'as', 'far', 'atmosphere', 'woods', 'are', 'creepy', 'place', 'especially', 'night', '34', 'Fear', '34', 'capitalizes', 'majority', 'film', 'place', 'Tom', 'car', 'much', 'most', '34', 'Saw', '34', 'took', 'place', 'one', 'bathroom', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'what', 'most', 'tension', 'rustling', 'leaves', 'right', 'darkness', 'hits', 'Lucy', 'hair', 'being', 'pulled', 'Tom', 'car', 'alarm', 'going', 'off', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'Tom', 'Lucy', 'find', 'weaving', 'down', 'winding', 'disorienting', 'country', 'roads', 'impending', 'sense', 'unknown', 'perfectly', 'established', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'naturally', 'film', 'apart', 'when', 'reveal', 'secluded', 'horror.The', 'film', 'wobble', 'time', 'tree', 'branches', 'begin', 'scratching', 'car', 'Tom', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'swigs', 'alcohol', 'driving', 'tree', 'almost', 'scarecrow', 'Lucy', 'someone', 'mask', 'lurks', 'shadows', 'watching', 'Tom', 'urinate', 'expect', 'get', 'answers', 'time', 'Max', 'Allen', 'Leech', 'introduced', 'character', 'only', 'things', 'more', 'confusing', 'very', 'obvious', 'where', 'Max', 'character', 'going', 'actions', 'are', 'just', 'baffling', 'especially', 'entire', 'fumbling', 'around', 'mud', 'scene', ""'re"", 'given', 'face', 'who', 'causing', 'everything', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'explained', 'back', 'spilled', 'drink', 'pub', 'beginning', 'film', 'Did', 'other', 'guy', 'spill', 'Did', 'Tom', 'spill', 'Who', 'bought', 'who', 'round', 'drinks', 'keep', 'peace', 'point', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care.There', 'are', 'traces', 'films', 'such', '34', 'Hitcher', '34', '34', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', '34', '34', 'Joy', 'Ride', '34', '34', 'Hush', '34', 'wrapped', 'up', 'DNA', '34', 'Fear', '34', 'unfortunately', 'DNA', 'more', 'clone', 'own', 'identity', 'story', 'purpose', 'so', 'naturally', ""n't"", 'feel', 'very', 'gratifying', 'ending', 'leaves', 'verge', 'being', 'infuriated', 'basically', 'one-sided', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'cat', 'obviously', 'having', 'upper', 'hand', 'mouse', 'not', 'having', 'sort', 'chance', 'whatsoever', '34', 'Fear', '34', 'promising', 'thriller', 'early', 'buckles', 'tension', 'viewer', 'haze']",In Fear
1688071,AWH5ZZ8UXY1QJ,B00HEM9PW6,Decoratin4Fun!,"[0, 0]","In Fear's director, Jeremy Lovering, aspired to shoot In Fear in a David O. Russell fashion where the actors improvised every scene.  While it is hard to know whether we can attribute the poor result to that style of shooting, In Fear's meandering second and third acts fail to build tension.Probably the film's biggest pitfall is its central antagonist.  Basically he is far too normal and charismatic seeming to be scary.  It seems like Lovering was going for a kind of Fatal Attraction set up, where the person who seems normal sort of rips off their mask, and reveals a seriously disturbing streak of sadism.The villain here rips off A mask, but he never fully transforms into the monster this kind of film requires.  At worst he seems.. judgemental, and often he just seems like a pedestrian hooligan prankster.  He isn't crazy enough to be taken as slasher type killer, but he isn't developed to be a more grounded villain either.  There is only one scene where he is actually physically violent, and he demonstrates a weird ability to overpower the other characters which is more confusing than frightening (he isn't particularly big or muscular looking).The film has a couple bits of creepy scenery, which paint a rural 'lawless' backwoods town.  We see all dirt roads, raw old wooden deserted shacks, ominous scarecrows in the distance, lots of forestry obscuring the immediate surroundings.  But again, with no legitimate strife placed on our protagonists (outside of an inability to navigate, and the cliche loss of cell/satellite-GPS signal) it is sort of like the Irish Chainsaw Massacre.... but without the Chainsaw and Masacre parts.Unfortunately this is film trying to put a spin on the genre, that can't seem to escape its most rote tropes or adapt them in a logical entertaining way.  It sets up the protagonists' basic predicament well, but then it repeats that set up over and over again, instead of actually developing a more meaningful conflict.  We can't root for anyone, we can't be mortified.  We just kind of scratch our heads and yawn.While sort of an interesting film experiment, In Fear is ultimately a failed one.",2,A Creative Failure,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,2143,"['Fear', 'director', 'Jeremy', 'Lovering', 'aspired', 'shoot', 'Fear', 'David', 'O.', 'Russell', 'fashion', 'where', 'actors', 'improvised', 'scene', 'hard', 'know', 'can', 'attribute', 'poor', 'result', 'style', 'shooting', 'Fear', 'meandering', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'fail', 'build', 'tension.Probably', 'film', 'biggest', 'pitfall', 'central', 'antagonist', 'Basically', 'far', 'too', 'normal', 'charismatic', 'seeming', 'be', 'scary', 'Lovering', 'was', 'going', 'kind', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'set', 'up', 'where', 'person', 'who', 'normal', 'sort', 'rips', 'mask', 'seriously', 'disturbing', 'streak', 'sadism.The', 'villain', 'here', 'mask', 'never', 'fully', 'monster', 'kind', 'film', 'worst', 'seems..', 'judgemental', 'often', 'just', 'pedestrian', 'hooligan', 'prankster', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'enough', 'be', 'taken', 'slasher', 'type', 'killer', ""n't"", 'developed', 'be', 'more', 'grounded', 'villain', 'either', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'actually', 'physically', 'violent', 'weird', 'ability', 'overpower', 'other', 'characters', 'more', 'confusing', 'frightening', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'big', 'muscular', 'looking', '.The', 'film', 'couple', 'bits', 'creepy', 'scenery', 'paint', 'rural', ""'lawless"", 'backwoods', 'town', 'see', 'dirt', 'roads', 'raw', 'old', 'wooden', 'deserted', 'shacks', 'ominous', 'scarecrows', 'distance', 'lots', 'forestry', 'obscuring', 'immediate', 'surroundings', 'again', 'legitimate', 'strife', 'placed', 'protagonists', 'inability', 'navigate', 'cliche', 'loss', 'cell/satellite-GPS', 'signal', 'sort', 'Irish', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Chainsaw', 'Masacre', 'parts.Unfortunately', 'film', 'trying', 'put', 'spin', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'escape', 'most', 'rote', 'tropes', 'adapt', 'logical', 'entertaining', 'way', 'up', 'protagonists', 'basic', 'predicament', 'well', 'then', 'set', 'up', 'over', 'again', 'instead', 'actually', 'developing', 'more', 'meaningful', 'conflict', 'ca', ""n't"", 'root', 'anyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'mortified', 'just', 'kind', 'scratch', 'heads', 'yawn.While', 'sort', 'interesting', 'film', 'experiment', 'Fear', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'one']",In Fear
1688072,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00HEM9PW6,D. Holmes,"[0, 0]","Driving to a music festival in Ireland, new couple Lucy and Tom lose their way on complex, winding country roads while in search of a hotel.  Their frustration turns to desperation and fear when they are then set upon by a cruel and mysterious evil.  For the first hour, I believe In Fear (a brief and apt title) is a genre masterpiece or close to it.  I am an avowed fan of films trusting in the power of the audience's imagination, teasing and firing it with a subtle visual clue here, an unusual sound there.  Lucy and Tom's day trip turned nightmare becomes a source of almost unprecedented suspense, and no element (such as the car itself, at once a space of imagined safety and genuine claustrophobia) goes underutilized.  The film's unusual production, in which the cast were often unaware how a scenario would end or what lay in wait around the next turn, leaves no visible trace beyond the more-authentic-than-usual displays of anxiety put forth by the gifted leads:  Iain De Caestecker and Alice Englert (the fetching daughter of beloved New Zealand director Jane Campion).Alas, every film must end, and this is where In Fear loses its way to a certain extent.  It is, to be honest, not an unexpected problem:  after unfolding as an exercise in direct, elegant, no-bull atmosphere and menace for an hour, the final 20 or so minutes are burdened with explanation, revelation, and a more direct form of conflict.  There is still a fair share of excitement within the climax, but one's mind turns to the concrete and quantifiable, such as the question of logistics and motivations, and the vast sense of unease cannot help but be undermined once given literal shape.",4,An amazing suspense film with an unfortunately uneven third act,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,1673,"['Driving', 'music', 'festival', 'Ireland', 'new', 'couple', 'Lucy', 'Tom', 'lose', 'way', 'complex', 'winding', 'country', 'roads', 'search', 'hotel', 'frustration', 'desperation', 'fear', 'when', 'are', 'then', 'set', 'upon', 'cruel', 'mysterious', 'evil', 'first', 'hour', 'believe', 'Fear', 'brief', 'apt', 'title', 'genre', 'masterpiece', 'close', 'am', 'avowed', 'fan', 'films', 'trusting', 'power', 'audience', 'imagination', 'teasing', 'firing', 'subtle', 'visual', 'clue', 'here', 'unusual', 'sound', 'there', 'Lucy', 'Tom', 'day', 'trip', 'turned', 'nightmare', 'source', 'almost', 'unprecedented', 'suspense', 'element', 'such', 'car', 'once', 'space', 'imagined', 'safety', 'genuine', 'claustrophobia', 'underutilized', 'film', 'unusual', 'production', 'cast', 'were', 'often', 'unaware', 'how', 'scenario', 'would', 'end', 'what', 'lay', 'wait', 'next', 'turn', 'visible', 'trace', 'more-authentic-than-usual', 'displays', 'anxiety', 'put', 'forth', 'gifted', 'leads', 'Iain', 'De', 'Caestecker', 'Alice', 'Englert', 'fetching', 'daughter', 'beloved', 'New', 'Zealand', 'director', 'Jane', 'Campion', '.Alas', 'film', 'must', 'end', 'where', 'Fear', 'way', 'certain', 'extent', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'unexpected', 'problem', 'unfolding', 'exercise', 'direct', 'elegant', 'no-bull', 'atmosphere', 'menace', 'hour', 'final', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'are', 'burdened', 'explanation', 'revelation', 'more', 'direct', 'form', 'conflict', 'still', 'fair', 'share', 'excitement', 'climax', 'one', 'mind', 'concrete', 'quantifiable', 'such', 'question', 'logistics', 'motivations', 'vast', 'sense', 'unease', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'undermined', 'once', 'given', 'literal', 'shape']",In Fear

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Its production values are strong, acting is good overall (tho my own personal feeling about the female protag was that she wasn't very interesting to watch), and the antag is a worthy antag. The 'force' in the synopsis led me to expect a supernatural flick. Its not that. The beginning took a little too long in my book to get kicking. They could've shortened the driving in circles part. But by the time the action kicked off, once they pick up the guy, the pace is steady and tension is sustained well throughout. I personally liked the ending, as it allowed me to use my imagination. I would've been disappointed if an ending I didn't like was foisted upon me. I personally chose the ending based on the story the guy in the car told about someone who stood in the middle of the road to see what happened, and the driver swerved and was killed instantly. I have no idea if that was what I was supposed to take away or not but that's what I prefer. Don't hesitate in dialing this one up if you think its a badly made movie.

Although it's easy to see why the film was chosen to be showcased at the event, it still doesn't quite measure up and falls short of taking home any awards. While it does its job by putting audiences in the grip of fear and tension, you're still left feeling much like the tormented couple lost while driving through the woods. I begged the question, &#34;Where is this going?&#34; as I couldn't shake the sensation of going around in circles and not getting anywhere.Tom and Lucy have known each other for two weeks. Wanting to get acquainted with each other, they embark on a road trip to a music festival in Ireland. The two decide to stay at an out-of-the-way hotel for a romantic evening alone before meeting up with their friends. After being led out into the middle of nowhere, they discover they've been the victims of someone's sick and deranged plans to torture and stalk them.&#34;In Fear&#34; does a great job putting to use its Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround sound mix. You'll feel like you're enveloped by the woods and being swallowed by all the noises and sinister quiet the film uses to keep viewers constantly on the edge of their seats. The crew that handled the sound editing for this movie deserves a huge pat on the back.The movie is given a widescreen presentation (2:35.1). Much of &#34;In Fear&#34; takes place at night and Director /Writer Jeremy Lovering uses the darkness to his advantage. The picture quality is still clean and clear, but only reveals what he wants the audience to see.One special feature is found on the Blu-ray for &#34;In Fear.&#34; A featurette entitled &#34;'In Fear:' Behind the Scenes&#34; digs a bit below the surface and explores the making of the movie. There are interviews with the cast and crew and footage of the production. Director/Writer Jeremy Lovering also discusses what he was trying to accomplish and say with the film.&#34;In Fear&#34; is rated R for some disturbing violent content and terror, and language. There are really no adult situations or nudity involved. Tom and Lucy kiss at one point and that's it. Things definitely get very tense at times and you're left sympathizing with the couple as they suffer through one frightening ordeal after the next.Although it's far from perfect, &#34;In Fear&#34; does what its creator wanted it to. It strikes fear and anxiety in the hearts of the viewing audience. There's no way you can watch it without experiencing some level of stress or panic.The problem isn't really with the establishment of the atmosphere &#34;In Fear&#34; exudes. What it's missing is any sense of bearing or end goal.

This should not be surprising, I suppose, as I have been overly busy the past couple of months with the weather, the move, and everything else.  But I&#8217;m very thankful the fine folks at Anchor Bay sent it to me.  This is one heck of a thrill ride, and every horror fan should check this one out!If you&#8217;ve been driving for a while, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve found yourself in the middle of nowhere at least once.  In a rural area like where I live, there are plenty of places to get turned around.  As such, the feeling of being lost in a remote location can be very unsettling.  This film takes that sensation to an extreme!IN FEAR is shot very well and looks excellent onscreen.  I have to tip my hat to the cinematographer, David Katznelson; he is obviously talented, and this film is a true testament to that talent.  In fact, the whole production team should be commended.  The film looks great and feels like a high-budget production.Likewise, the cast does a great job as well.  Iain De Caestcker and Alice Englert play off of each other like they&#8217;ve been friends for years.  And supporting cast member Allen Leech is creepy and devilish, the perfect antagonist for a piece like this.  All three give stellar performances and help to make this film a perfect ten.There are plenty of thrills and chills here as well.  IN FEAR doesn&#8217;t just prey on your senses&#8230;it feeds off of your fears, too.  And in doing so, it takes you on a roller coaster ride of horror.  You won&#8217;t be the same after watching this film, I guarantee you that.IN FEAR is a heck of a win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  Even if you&#8217;re not a horror fan per se, it&#8217;s a slick and effective thriller that will keep you guessing.

Relatively mundane events are made engaging via subtle repartee, restive close-ups and an eerie musical score (including the closing credits) while the added dimension of a strained relationship increases overall credibility.  The viewer is kept guessing as to what's really going on throughout the majority of this movie however the last 20 minutes head in a legitimately unexpected direction which makes the previous 65 a retrospective crescendo of suspense and yet even then we can't say for sure exactly what the source of the terror is as the veil of mystery is never fully parted.This is very much a stand-apart film from what we're seeing in the genre these days but I suspect it's destined for sleeper status given a relative lack of star power and that it relies more on subtlety than shock however I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for a rent and I could actually see myself watching it again.  :o)",4,A Spiraling Road to Terror,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,1490,"['Fans', 'creative', 'horror', 'should', 'enjoy', 'clever', 'little', 'flick', 'director', 'Jeremy', 'Lovering', 'Iain', 'De', 'Caestecker', 'Agents', 'SHIELD', 'peace', 'quiet-loving', 'guy', 'taking', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Alice', 'Englert', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'country', 'only', 'find', 'trapped', 'psychotic', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Fear', 'while', 'get', 'started', 'however', 'maintain', 'certain', 'sense', 'dread', 'get-go', 'filming', 'style', 'decidedly', 'cold', 'blue', 'heavy', 'shadows', 'occasionally', 'hand-held', 'effective', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'isolation', 'fear', 'Relatively', 'mundane', 'events', 'are', 'made', 'engaging', 'subtle', 'repartee', 'restive', 'close-ups', 'eerie', 'musical', 'score', 'including', 'closing', 'credits', 'added', 'dimension', 'strained', 'relationship', 'increases', 'overall', 'credibility', 'viewer', 'kept', 'guessing', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'majority', 'movie', 'however', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'head', 'legitimately', 'unexpected', 'direction', 'previous', '65', 'retrospective', 'crescendo', 'suspense', 'yet', 'even', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'source', 'terror', 'veil', 'mystery', 'never', 'fully', 'parted.This', 'very', 'much', 'stand-apart', 'film', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'genre', 'days', 'suspect', 'destined', 'sleeper', 'status', 'given', 'relative', 'lack', 'star', 'power', 'more', 'subtlety', 'shock', 'however', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'rent', 'could', 'actually', 'see', 'watching', 'again', 'o']",In Fear

It tells the story of a couple who have only been together for two weeks but decide to go to a music festival together in Ireland. Once in the Emerald Isle Tom announces to Lucy that he has a wee bit of a surprise; that instead of heading off to a muddy field for the first night, he has booked them into a luxury hotel which he found on the inter web.This entails following a Land Rover to the destination as it is a bit remote. Well it only takes them part way and then they are told to follow the signs. The problem is that they seem to be going in circles and appear to be lost. The fuel starts to drop as they endlessly try to get back to the main road or the hotel. Then night closes in and as darkness engulfs them so do their options get less easy to see. What follows will give all concerned a night to remember for all the wrong reasons.Now this received a very wide variance of reactions on its release. It is one of those that has either been loved or at least `liked' or downright hated. One of the issues is it is mostly filmed in the beleaguered car; so we are heavily reliant on the couple for emotional build up to get the fright fest we all want. Some have said they could not see the point and there was no `plot'; well if you blink at the right time you will miss the whole point of what is to come, so I can sympathise with those who have expressed such concerns. The action when it comes seems stilted though and there are a lot of actions that are questionable. The sort of things that people only ever do in horror films, you know go into the dark scary room with no light etc.Overall it managed to hold my attention right up until the end (it is only 85 minutes long) and it had some very scary moments which worked really well, the cinematography is very good given the limited scope and the scenery looks great.

1688093,A1Q3GEO516I4VK,B00HEM9PW6,Twisted Slasher,"[10, 12]","In Fear features a good trailer and glowing reviews, in particular its Sundance selection.  I always get kind of geeked when horror films receive a Sundance film selection, as I tend to think &#34;average&#34; movie goers like you and I enjoyed the film.  Well, I don't want to say the glowing reviews are misplaced...but I think the glowing reviews are misplaced.In Fear commits three cardinal sins for horror films.  That's three too many.  First, there's a very, very unlikable lead character.  The character of Tom is so perfectly hatable, I didn't particularly care what happened to him during this film.  Even his co-main character, Lucy, doesn't seem to care what happens to him, although to Lucy's credit she is kind of likable, but isn't really given much to do until the third act of the movie.Second, as C. Sawin before mentioned, it isn't long before the movie handcuffs itself into not giving the characters many options for success.  Everything that can go wrong for them, does.  So, then why make everything so predictable?  Nothing ruins potential tension like predictable tension does.  The GPS loses reception.  The phones lose reception.  The car's gonna run out of gas at some point. And there's no clues or any kind of logic to what's happening to these characters in the film.  Which brings me to:Third, the movie makes no sense.  At first, it's hinted that because Tom spilled a pint of beer on a guy's shirt, he's got his whole mob of flunkies out to get revenge.  So, was this all about a pint of spilled beer?  No, as it turns out, it was all one lunatic guy who likes to put on a big production for all his quarries of kills.  But then, why go to the big production?  How can he constantly flip all the signs by himself?  How can he be everywhere at once?  Does he have teleportation skills?  And why not just kill these two quickly so he can move on?  Is it because he's enjoying himself too much or does he just want to do what he can to push the runtime to an hour and a half?  These questions and more needed answering, but it's wishful thinking to hope for an explanation.Speaking of padding runtime, a good drinking game you could play with your buddies is count how many times the camera either cuts to a closeup of the characters' eyes or cuts to showing the road.  Most of the film is just the car driving; in fact, there's more car driving here than in the Fast and Furious films.  But it's about as exciting of a drive as the family from Manos: The Hands of Fate driving to the Valley Lodge.  And that drive was a lot shorter.Alas, the movie can't make up for its suckiness by providing boobs, gore or hilarious one-liners, rendering this a complete dud.",1,I Really Wanted to Like This,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,2692,"['Fear', 'good', 'trailer', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'particular', 'Sundance', 'selection', 'always', 'get', 'kind', 'geeked', 'when', 'horror', 'films', 'receive', 'Sundance', 'film', 'selection', 'tend', 'think', '34', 'average', '34', 'movie', 'goers', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'are', 'misplaced', 'think', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'are', 'misplaced.In', 'Fear', 'commits', 'three', 'cardinal', 'sins', 'horror', 'films', 'three', 'too', 'many', 'First', 'very', 'very', 'unlikable', 'lead', 'character', 'character', 'Tom', 'so', 'perfectly', 'hatable', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'Even', 'co-main', 'character', 'Lucy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'what', 'Lucy', 'credit', 'kind', 'likable', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'third', 'act', 'movie.Second', 'C.', 'Sawin', 'mentioned', ""n't"", 'long', 'movie', 'not', 'giving', 'characters', 'many', 'options', 'success', 'Everything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'So', 'then', 'why', 'make', 'everything', 'so', 'predictable', 'Nothing', 'potential', 'tension', 'predictable', 'tension', 'GPS', 'reception', 'phones', 'lose', 'reception', 'car', 'gon', 'run', 'gas', 'point', 'clues', 'kind', 'logic', 'what', 'happening', 'characters', 'film', 'Third', 'movie', 'sense', 'first', 'hinted', 'Tom', 'spilled', 'pint', 'beer', 'guy', 'shirt', 'got', 'whole', 'mob', 'flunkies', 'out', 'get', 'revenge', 'So', 'was', 'pint', 'spilled', 'beer', 'No', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'lunatic', 'guy', 'who', 'put', 'big', 'production', 'quarries', 'kills', 'then', 'why', 'go', 'big', 'production', 'How', 'can', 'constantly', 'signs', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'everywhere', 'once', 'have', 'teleportation', 'skills', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'kill', 'two', 'quickly', 'can', 'move', 'enjoying', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'push', 'runtime', 'hour', 'half', 'questions', 'more', 'needed', 'answering', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'hope', 'explanation.Speaking', 'padding', 'runtime', 'good', 'drinking', 'game', 'could', 'play', 'buddies', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'camera', 'cuts', 'closeup', 'characters', 'eyes', 'cuts', 'showing', 'road', 'Most', 'film', 'just', 'car', 'driving', 'fact', 'more', 'car', 'driving', 'here', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'films', 'exciting', 'drive', 'family', 'Manos', 'Hands', 'Fate', 'driving', 'Valley', 'Lodge', 'drive', 'was', 'lot', 'shorter.Alas', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'suckiness', 'providing', 'boobs', 'gore', 'hilarious', 'one-liners', 'rendering', 'complete', 'dud']",In Fear

I really like Iain De Caestecker in Agents of SHIELD, but even he couldn&#8217;t make this movie interesting to me.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So something happened at a pub.  Want to know what happened?  Sorry, we never find out.  Then we have our two main characters, Tom and Lucy driving around the countryside looking for a hotel they have reservations at.  They are being chased and tormented by some unnamed psycho that is moving signs around to keep them lost.Then they pick up some wounded guy named Max, and right away I knew this guy wasn&#8217;t on the up and up.  His forehead is cut and he is bleeding like crazy and insisting that he was attacked.  Later we find out that he was the guy who was doing everything.Okay so how did he manage to get ahead of them and switch the signs around every time they came up at a crossroads?  Was he teleporting around the woods?  Also how did he manage to cut this tree down without them hearing it?  Did he have a chainsaw that was completely silent?  Plus what happened to Tom?  He just left the car and suddenly he was gone with no explanation of what happened to him.Then Lucy is back in the car and finally finds the hotel they&#8217;ve been trying to find.  Turns out it is completely run down and has broken down cars everywhere around it that shows us that this Max guy has been doing this for a LOOOOONNNNG time to unsuspecting travelers.  Why can&#8217;t we know about that!?!  That sounds much more interesting than following these two boring characters around!  I&#8217;d love to know Max&#8217;s story and about this run down hotel!And the ending?  Lucy manages to find the main road again.  How did she do this?  Sorry, we never find out.  Then she sees that Max is in the middle of the road and taunting her to hit him.  She guns the engine and races towards him and just as she is about to hit him, we cut to black and the credits roll.Really!?!  You pulled a Sopranos on us!?!  We don&#8217;t even get to see if she actually hit him or if it was a trap!?!  What a gyp!***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***The story was just lame and uninteresting.  The whole time I was playing with my dog, checking my phone and surfing the web.  The story wasn&#8217;t engaging at all and was just boring.  The only good thing about the movie was the soundtrack.
