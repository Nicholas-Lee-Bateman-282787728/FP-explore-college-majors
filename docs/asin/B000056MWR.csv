I had read that some people found it confusing or disliked the way the story was laid out and was worried that, even though I was interested enough to purchase it, I would end up not watching it much.What did I worry for?The artwork and direction comes from the same people who brought you Magic Knight Rayeart and Outlaw Star, respectively.  Though the big &quot;anime eyes&quot; are a bit larger than normal in this series, the characters and scenery are extremely detailed and the voice acting flows with events very well (on both parts, actually).As far as the story, I really liked it.  Of course, this is coming from someone who thoroughly enjoyed Evangelion and LAIN, despite having to think about things a bit.  Sure, as people have noted, the last two episodes basically do belong at the beginning of the DVD, but it doesn't take long after the first episode starts to piece together what is going on.  Tiara, the &quot;main character,&quot; is a powerful Magic User sent to regain the Throne of Yord, a mystical entity that grants power to the Guardian World.

It'snot the deepest, most meaningful anime out there, and it certainly isn't a cutting-edge drama. But, much like directorMitsuru Hongo's other anime, ""Outlaw Star"" (which is one of my all-time favorites), it doesn't NEED to be any of those otherthings. Why? Because, for the course of it's six episodes, it keeps the viewer constantly entertained, which is an achievementin it's own right. While there is some genuine intrigue to be had in this series, you don't really have to pay much attentionto it in order to be satisfied. Cute girls with ludicrous proportions wield ridiculously powerful monsters, fight each otherand search for lost loves.

Strangely enough, this seems to work with this anime series.  I, personally, feel that if this series had been shown in chronological order, interest would've been lost, 'thus creating a fan following to be lost.  While it does make things confusing at first, just don't think about things so hard as you're watching it.  It's nothing really that difficult to grasp, just something you'll have to &quot;ride through&quot; as you watch it.  Besides, it's a one deal DVD, all of the episodes are featured on it, so you don't have to worry about buying another DVD volume if you are one of those types to finish what you start watching.As always with Clamp, the artwork is just absolutely stunning.  I know some people hate Clamp's work, with the large eyes and such, but I find it gorgeous.  While they only did the character designs for this series, I'm sure if any other artist had done this series it would have lacked what effect the series creates.In short, if you love a darker themed &quot;magical girl&quot;(altho' Shamanic Princess isn't really you're typcial &quot;magical girl&quot; anime) anime, or if you absolutely love Clamp, it is strongly recommended.

The story focuses on Tiara, a girl possessing great magical powers, who enters the human world to retrieve a stolen artifact.  The scenes of magical combat are the highlights, with some beautiful magical effects and creative rituals and forms of combat.Unfortunately, that's not enough to give a whole-hearted recommendation to Shamanic Princess, as the story is poorly plotted and executed.  The first tipoff that there's a story problem is simple: the show starts in the middle and proceeds to a conclusion.  The fourth episode contains that conclusion, with the beginning of the story then told in the last two episodes.  Once you've watched the whole thing, it's obvious why: the writers had to artificially create a sense of mystery by withholding information from the viewer.  This is a cheap tactic, ill-suited to an obviously high budget show such as this.The harder question is whether Shamanic Princess is good or bad as a whole.  If you're willing to sacrifice story for visuals (note: the music is also nice), then don't hesitate to buy this.  If you favor story over visuals, this likely isn't your best buy.",3,Pretty but lacking in story,991353600,"06 1, 2001",2001,1245,"['Shamanic', 'Princess', 'often', 'gorgeous', 'show', 'intriguing', 'character', 'designs', 'few', 'spectacularly-animated', 'sequences', 'story', 'Tiara', 'girl', 'possessing', 'great', 'magical', 'powers', 'who', 'human', 'world', 'retrieve', 'stolen', 'artifact', 'scenes', 'magical', 'combat', 'are', 'highlights', 'beautiful', 'magical', 'effects', 'creative', 'rituals', 'forms', 'combat.Unfortunately', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'whole-hearted', 'recommendation', 'Shamanic', 'Princess', 'story', 'poorly', 'plotted', 'executed', 'first', 'tipoff', 'story', 'problem', 'simple', 'show', 'middle', 'proceeds', 'conclusion', 'fourth', 'episode', 'conclusion', 'beginning', 'story', 'then', 'told', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'obvious', 'why', 'writers', 'had', 'artificially', 'create', 'sense', 'mystery', 'withholding', 'information', 'viewer', 'cheap', 'tactic', 'ill-suited', 'obviously', 'high', 'budget', 'show', 'such', 'this.The', 'harder', 'question', 'Shamanic', 'Princess', 'good', 'bad', 'whole', ""'re"", 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'story', 'visuals', 'note', 'music', 'also', 'nice', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buy', 'favor', 'story', 'visuals', 'likely', ""n't"", 'best', 'buy']",N/A
569922,A2OYQ024U4CRI0,B000056MWR,T. Eddy,"[5, 5]","I recently watched this series and it's good.  There is a lot of action and the story tends to flow rather quickly, maybe too quickly.  Although the technical material was not really explained, you can still understand it.The box is rated at 13 and up and that is rather suiting.  There is a lot of violence (as with most action animes) but the nudity is VERY brief, maybe 5 seconds of actual nudity within the whole 3 hours (towards the end), and those 5 seconds you don't really see anything.  The rest of the series is just the tight clothes the female characters wear.  Basically, if you're comfortable with the cover of the box, then there should be no problem.The layout of the series is a little confusing.  Episodes one through four progress through.  At the end of the fourth episode is the &quot;end&quot; of the series.  Episodes five and six are flashbacks to before the first episode.  So the chronological order of the series is 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, and then 4.  I would still watch it in the order it is on the DVD simply because episodes 5 and 6 contain things that would spoil the other episodes if you didn't see those.  But if you are confused after the fourth episode, keep watching the second two because it will answer a lot of the questions you may be having.Overall, it's a good series.  The animation is good and the English dub is good. The plotline isn't so complicated you can't follow, but not so linear that you get bored.  If you can afford the somewhat hefty price tag, I would highly recommend this.",5,"Excellent film, layout a little confusing",1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,1526,"['recently', 'watched', 'series', 'good', 'lot', 'action', 'story', 'flow', 'rather', 'quickly', 'maybe', 'too', 'quickly', 'technical', 'material', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'explained', 'can', 'still', 'understand', 'it.The', 'box', 'rated', '13', 'up', 'rather', 'suiting', 'lot', 'violence', 'most', 'action', 'animes', 'nudity', 'VERY', 'brief', 'maybe', '5', 'seconds', 'actual', 'nudity', 'whole', '3', 'hours', 'end', '5', 'seconds', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'anything', 'rest', 'series', 'just', 'tight', 'clothes', 'female', 'characters', 'wear', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'comfortable', 'cover', 'box', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'problem.The', 'layout', 'series', 'little', 'confusing', 'one', 'four', 'progress', 'end', 'fourth', 'episode', 'quot', 'end', 'quot', 'series', 'Episodes', 'five', 'six', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'episode', 'chronological', 'order', 'series', '5', '6', '1', '2', '3', 'then', '4', 'would', 'still', 'watch', 'order', 'DVD', 'simply', 'episodes', '5', '6', 'contain', 'things', 'would', 'spoil', 'other', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'are', 'confused', 'fourth', 'episode', 'keep', 'watching', 'second', 'two', 'will', 'answer', 'lot', 'questions', 'may', 'be', 'having.Overall', 'good', 'series', 'animation', 'good', 'English', 'dub', 'good', 'plotline', ""n't"", 'so', 'complicated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'not', 'so', 'linear', 'get', 'bored', 'can', 'afford', 'somewhat', 'hefty', 'price', 'tag', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Hooker ""bulmabriefs144""","[30, 35]","I've heard reviews from both the Amazon raters and from the Anime Encyclopedia claiming that this film is convoluted and incoherent.  I checked it out anyway and decided they were wrong here (though they were right about Maze, it stunk) as I had no trouble following the plot. As I watched though, I found that there were several tricks to following the action. First, you need to learn to filter flashbacks and mirages from the current events. Second, you need a basic grasp of Eastern philosophy, particularly Taoism. Third, you have to understand that the last episodes were flashbacks.

Fairly common problem even on new products, but for scratches as deep as this it BETTER play flawlessly. As for the anime itself it's an usual title because you REALLY need to pay attention to the plot to understand it. It basically begins at where the story ends and the character has multiple flashbacks trying to figure out problems. Not a bad anime, I'm not striking a 1 star because of that.
