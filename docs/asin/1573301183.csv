188266,AZSN1TO0JI87B,1573301183,A. Estes,"[4, 4]","Performing for the first time after a three year break from the road, Alice in Chains took to the stage in April of 1996 to perform an intimate set for MTV's ""Unplugged"" series. As the darkest and moodiest of the big-four grunge bands that defined and dominated the 90's, Alice in Chains were without a doubt at their most natural in an acoustic setting, having recorded two semi-acoustic EP's inSapandJar of Flies. With thirteen of the band's finest tunes in tow, this DVD features the entire performance -- including three songs omitted from the original broadcast -- in all of its Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound glory.Taking to the stage just in time to lay down the first line of the opening number, ""Nutshell,"" singer Layne Staley is blatantly struggling with addiction and would rather be somewhere else. In spite of his tendencies to shy away from the crowd and flub a few lyrics (""Sludge Factory"" in particular comes to a halt to allow him to get his act together) Staley turns in a solid and haunting vocal performance, without letting his demons get the best of him.  The band, on the other hand, is as tight as they ever were, with Jerry Cantrell stepping in as frontman more than a few times and Mike Inez taking not one, but two jabs at the band's pals in Metallica, one of which being the somewhat infamous text on his bass guitar, which reads: ""Friends don't let friends getFriendshaircuts,"" a not-so-subtle poke at the band's mid-career crisis.Even though Alice in Chains were themselves experiencing a crisis of sorts at the time, they still manage to put forth a stripped-down set that is alternately haunting and fun. The setlist skips over the entireFaceliftalbum, which is a shame, as an acoustic rendition of, say, ""Man in the Box"" could have been really interesting to hear. The DVD features are skimpy, consisting of a discography and an incomplete but amusing timeline of the band's history, up to 1999. While the band would ultimately collapse under the weight of addiction and Layne's inevitable death (only to re-emerge in later years) this set is proof of just how powerful and potent its classic line-up (well, post-Mike Starr, anyways) and the iconic songs they created together remains.",5,Alice Unchained,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2220,"['Performing', 'first', 'time', 'three', 'year', 'break', 'road', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'took', 'stage', 'April', '1996', 'perform', 'intimate', 'set', 'MTV', 'Unplugged', 'series', 'darkest', 'moodiest', 'big-four', 'grunge', 'bands', 'defined', 'dominated', '90', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'were', 'doubt', 'most', 'natural', 'acoustic', 'setting', 'having', 'recorded', 'two', 'semi-acoustic', 'EP', 'inSapandJar', 'Flies', 'thirteen', 'band', 'finest', 'tunes', 'tow', 'DVD', 'entire', 'performance', 'including', 'three', 'songs', 'omitted', 'original', 'broadcast', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'glory.Taking', 'stage', 'just', 'time', 'lay', 'down', 'first', 'line', 'opening', 'number', 'Nutshell', 'singer', 'Layne', 'Staley', 'blatantly', 'struggling', 'addiction', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'somewhere', 'else', 'spite', 'tendencies', 'shy', 'away', 'crowd', 'flub', 'few', 'lyrics', 'Sludge', 'Factory', 'particular', 'halt', 'allow', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'Staley', 'solid', 'haunting', 'vocal', 'performance', 'letting', 'demons', 'get', 'best', 'band', 'other', 'hand', 'as', 'tight', 'ever', 'were', 'Jerry', 'Cantrell', 'stepping', 'frontman', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'Mike', 'Inez', 'taking', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'jabs', 'band', 'pals', 'Metallica', 'one', 'being', 'somewhat', 'infamous', 'text', 'bass', 'guitar', 'Friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'friends', 'getFriendshaircuts', 'not-so-subtle', 'poke', 'band', 'mid-career', 'crisis.Even', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'were', 'experiencing', 'crisis', 'sorts', 'time', 'still', 'manage', 'put', 'forth', 'stripped-down', 'set', 'alternately', 'haunting', 'fun', 'setlist', 'skips', 'entireFaceliftalbum', 'shame', 'acoustic', 'rendition', 'say', 'Man', 'Box', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'interesting', 'hear', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'skimpy', 'consisting', 'discography', 'incomplete', 'amusing', 'timeline', 'band', 'history', 'up', '1999', 'band', 'would', 'ultimately', 'collapse', 'weight', 'addiction', 'Layne', 'inevitable', 'death', 'only', 're-emerge', 'later', 'years', 'set', 'proof', 'just', 'how', 'powerful', 'potent', 'classic', 'line-up', 'well', 'post-Mike', 'Starr', 'iconic', 'songs', 'created', 'together']",N/A

It was their first live show in almost 3 years and while watching the DVD you can just tell that they really did love performing.  Layne Staley was one of the greatest vocalists of all time, when he sings you can feel the emotion.  Jerry is an amazing and underated guitar player, he has a beautiful voice as well.  This show is a little sad though, the atmosphere on most of the unplugged shows are very moody.  This DVD rocks and AIC set a standard for modern rock/alternative.  My favorites are ""Heaven Beside You"" and the unreleased song ""The Killer Is Me""... it has an amazing chorus and guitar riff.

Only after hearing Pearl Jam's acoustic CD did I begin to want this DVD. I eventually did buy it and was moved beyond words by the performance. Layne and Jerry's voices playing off of each other created a mood no other Unplugged performance will ever rival, and the guitars, bass, and drums are all hauntingly beautiful. What makes this different from the much more publicized performance of Nirvana's is that this entire set is beautiful and mellow whereas Nirvana's changed between somewhat upbeat and then depressing. Through the entire run time each time you look at Layne you feel pain and emotion flowing through his voice, particularly in Rooster. There are no low points with this set, every song is played perfectly and fits with the other songs like it should, nothing feels out of place. Jerry's voice at no time overpowers Layne's, and it sounds great throughout. No bad things can possibly be said about this DVD, performance, or this band. This is essential listening, you can tell from the 5-star average rating after over 60 reviews that everyone loves this performance.

Also, it is perhaps the most meanful MTV Unplugged release of them all.  Layne is at his tormented best, so deep in pain, you get chills just hearing him sing.  Oh so sad, but yet he makes it sound so sweet and beautiful.  Jerry is just equal to Layne, never adding too much nor taking much away.  Layne and Jerry I think are the last great dou to emerge from the whole 90's rock explosion.  Get this DVD, all you need to do is love music, not even be a fan of AIC's, just love music.

Every song on here is performed perfectly, it's here live that you can really see (and hear) the raw emotion in Staley's voice. While during the performances, everyone seems happy except Staley; During the places where commercial breaks are, you see that the band is happy and still have their sense of humor intact.

First of all the set list is perfect. The performance of the songs alone is stirring and powerful. The best version of &quot;Down in a hole&quot; is in this video. I've seen the video for &quot;down in a hole&quot; and it doesn't come close to the power of hearing and seeing the band perform the song live. Jerry Cantrell gives the other band members a smile during the performance because he knows that they are playing well. I was amazed at how Layne Staley sings so effortlessly and at the same time beautifully. The highlights of this video are obviously &quot;Down in a hole&quot;, &quot;Nutshell&quot;, and &quot;Killer is me.&quot; You'll also see a false start of &quot;sludge factory&quot; where Layne messes up on the lyrics or something. But after that the band's performance is flawless. As Layne said it is there &quot;best performance in three years.&quot; If you're an alice in chains fan you probably already have it and if you don't then you're procastinating.

They also know that he was a great musicsian, and it is a great shame that he ruined his and AIC's ability by getting all strung out on heroin.  This is a great DVD, but i must say that Layne's performance as a singer took a great toll on the band.  He is very quiet, the vocals are half-gone (seriously, they were faded and he missed a lot!), and it seems like Jerry Cantrell (guitarist) is holding the band up entirely.  It is almost like the band could have gotten along just fine without their frontman, and that just explains how Layne ended up dragging this concert down with himself.On another note, however, the rest of the performance was great, with Mike's bass playing far better than on album, Sean's drumming as precise as ever, and Jerry's guitar sounded good in acoustic form.This brings me to the final problem.  With ""unplugged"" taken literally, about half the songs on this album lose their impact entirely.  ""Angry Chair"", usually one of AIC's heaviest songs, is all stripped down and light on an acoustic guitar and bass.  Don't get me wrong, it is still great, but without the heavy songs adding impact, that just makes the whole performance a little boring.After these setbacks, the end result is an OK performance that die-hard/long-time fans will love for sure, but this IS NOT IN ANYWAY a good introduction to AIC.  The best intro to this band is their album ""Dirt"".  Get this if you know and love AIC.  If you are not a fan of awhile, this can be a dissapointment.

Beck,"[3, 4]","The Alice In Chains MTV Unplugged performance was a real treat to behold, especially considering that Layne Staley's drug issues had kept the band from touring regularly for some time. Unfortunately, this show is one of the last ones that the group would play, and as a result the documentation is all the more valuable and essential. My only real issue with the set list is that they play no songs from the band's debut Facelift album. If I remember correctly, the whole concept of the MTV Unplugged series was to take musicians whose majority of work was within an electric/synthetic framework and transpose the music into an acoustic setting. Granted the performances on this DVD are spectacular, and I really could not imagine an AIC unplugged venue without having classics like 'Nutshell' and 'Brother' covered. But those tunes were recorded as acoustic numbers, so they really don't get the treatment of a change of venue. Now the Facelift songs on the other hand were all heavy, electric-drenched numbers which would have been very interesting to hear in an acoustic setting. I think that the whole concept of the show is that you take a large sounding electric piece and transform it via acoustic instruments. AIC had a perfect opportunity to do this with at least 1 or 2 Facelift tunes, but decided to pass. This is disappointing, especially in light of the fact that every other AIC album is represented here.

From the beginning of the concert, you can plainly see that Layne Staley is high, even as the rest of the band jokes around and plays it off, it still comes off as tragic, but that didn't stop Layne from delivering a booming vocal performance.  This Unplugged session was undoubtadly one of, if not the, best Unplugged's that MTV has ever put together.  The rest of the band, including Jerry Cantrell, Sean Kinney, Mike Inez, and special guest Scott Olsen, is unbelieveably tight knit.
