1002906,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000GFLKEY,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[7, 13]","(3 1/2*'s) Spike Lee takes what could have been an above average TV crimeshow and elevates it into cool and campy art.  With a wisecracking detective, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) who must crack mission impossible, everything is in place for formidable entertainment.  We start with a prisoner, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), who is a bit of a Riddler in terrorist clothing.  (To keep law enforcement distracted, for instance, asks them, ""Which weighs more:  All the trains passing through Grand Station Terminal or all the trees cut down to make U.S. currency?  Generously, he offers it's a trick question.)  We're not sure what he wants, but he tells us his purpose is to rob a bank ""because he can"".  After that, the narrative is replaced by his actions to do just that at Manhattan's Bank and Trust.  He has quite a crew and set up as he and his cohorts enter disguised as painters.  Cleverly they knock out the cameras with infra red lights.  After terrorizing the people, he takes their cell phones, has them disrobe and makes them dress in terrorist garb, like their own.  The police in a daring rescue or capturing them upon release don't know the victims from the villains.  All the bugging is trumped in one way or another.  Just when you think the situation is thick enough, the bank executives come into the fray.  It turns out the bank president (Christopher Plummer) and his close associate, Ms. White (played with steely cool by Jody Foster) have a stake in Dalton's game.  The president has a sensitive secret which Dalton can exploit, so, while the hostage taker may not seem to be playing with a full deck, he is indeed working with a full hand.Intriguing through much and entertaining throughout, 'Inside Man' often is played like an inside joke, one caper that we can easily follow along.  Denzel Washington has some great, witty lines that are usually associated with James Bond or roles Bruce Willis plays.

1002909,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GFLKEY,A Customer,"[54, 73]","The one note about Spike Lee films is that you're never sure what you're going to get. I'm not really a fan, I find that his films are too convoluted with extraneous detail and somewhat over produced. Inside Man retains all the elements of a solid bank robbery/caper film, whilst also giving us Spike Lee's trademark of gritty, street-wise irreverence.The problem with Inside Man is that it's impossibly unbelievable with a plot that strains the realms of credibility; combine this with it's over-long running time and you have a film that features some great performances by it's cast - Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer and Jodie Foster - but ultimately sags a bit in the middle and ends up becoming rather ponderous.Lee manages to pull off a handful of effective scenes, but he doesn't have the flair to bring the whole movie off with real conviction. An enigmatic master criminal (Owen) - who spends most of the movie wearing a mask - plans and executes a ""genius plan"" in which he and several masked companions take over a Lower Manhattan bank and brutally seize several dozen of its customers as hostages.The NYPD negotiator given the task of dealing with these crooks is an affable junior detective, Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) - under a cloud of suspicion from a previous case - he soon surmises that the perpetrators don't actually want the bank's money. Enter smarmy and elegant New York political insider Madeline White (Foster) who knows everybody and even has the ear of the Mayor.Madeline is hired by the chairman of the bank's board of directors (Plummer) to oversee the crisis and make sure that certain secrets he has in his safe-deposit box stay secret. The bulk of the film involves the standoff between the bank robbers and the NYPD as they try frantically to ensure that the hostages remain safe.Of course we know the hostages survive because Lee inserts interview footage of them after the heist is over, this device, however, tips off the outcome, dissipates suspense and quickly becomes tiresome. This is just one of the many techniques Lee uses to clutter the movie's structure and prevent the plot from unfolding as quickly as it should.Obviously, everyone has something to hide, particularly the bank president, but when his past is revealed, it finally appears with a bit of a thud, with the movie going through to much difficulty to arrive at very little. In all fairness, Inside Man has some interesting things to say about race, money, power and the ethics of urban living, particularly in New York and the performances are wonderfully cynical and gritty.Washington is sexy and strong, Foster is skillfully odious as the icy, sophisticated and amoral Madeline who cares for nothing but chasing big bucks, Owen is morbidly compelling as the determined heavy and Plummer is letter-perfect as the guilt-ridden bank honcho.Lee, however, just doesn't seem able to bring all the disparate elements of a heist film into a convincing and gratifying whole and in the end; the movie is vaguely unsatisfying and impossibly far-fetched.

1002911,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000GFLKEY,Adam Craig,"[3, 3]","For about an hour and 45 minutes, Inside Man had me on the edge of my seat, totally clueless as to what was going on and how the film was going to be resolved.  But then, when the ending finally happened, I found myself to be pretty disappointed.  Not disappointed in the film overall, but just at how Spike Lee decided to wrap it up.The plot is really simple:  Dalton Russell, played brilliantly (as always) by Clive Owen, has devised ""the perfect bank robbery,"" which he is executing in a branch of the bank in the middle of New York City.  Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) is called on the scene as the head negotiator, and proceeds to delve into a cat-and-mouse game with Dalton.  The situation is further complicated when Jodie Foster, who plays an unexplained, extremely influential woman, comes onto the scene demanding to be given access to the robbers and to the bank itself.  Foster's character is the one part of the movie that just doesn't seem to fit.  We know why she is there, but her character is not developed at all.  We don't know why she does what she does, how she got to this point, or why she is so ridiculously confident about getting her way.Other than Foster's character, we pretty much know exactly the kind of person we are dealing with when it comes to Russell, Frazier, and the other important roles.  While the film does a great job of infusing the racial issue with the routine bank heist storyline, the film ultimately trips over its own feet.  A film with this much build up, and when the build up is this well done, needs to absolutely blow the viewer away with the ending, or the whole film seems to be for naught.  When the ending comes, I was left thinking, ""is this really why the robbers went to all this trouble?""  There are some minor plot holes, but the film does explain itself, just not to the extent that I was expecting or hoping for.  This is the best Spike Lee film that I have ever seen, but that really isn't saying that much...Inside Man definitely gets my recommendation, but be forewarned that the film ultimately can't live up to its own cleverness.",4,Great build up with a disappointing payoff,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,2109,"['hour', '45', 'minutes', 'Inside', 'Man', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'totally', 'clueless', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'resolved', 'then', 'when', 'ending', 'finally', 'happened', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'disappointed', 'film', 'overall', 'just', 'how', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'decided', 'wrap', 'up.The', 'plot', 'really', 'simple', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'always', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'devised', 'perfect', 'bank', 'robbery', 'executing', 'branch', 'bank', 'middle', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Detective', 'Frazier', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'called', 'scene', 'head', 'negotiator', 'proceeds', 'delve', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Dalton', 'situation', 'further', 'complicated', 'when', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'unexplained', 'extremely', 'influential', 'woman', 'scene', 'demanding', 'be', 'given', 'access', 'robbers', 'bank', 'Foster', 'character', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'know', 'why', 'there', 'character', 'not', 'developed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'what', 'how', 'got', 'point', 'why', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'confident', 'getting', 'way.Other', 'Foster', 'character', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'exactly', 'kind', 'person', 'are', 'dealing', 'when', 'Russell', 'Frazier', 'other', 'important', 'roles', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'infusing', 'racial', 'issue', 'routine', 'bank', 'heist', 'storyline', 'film', 'ultimately', 'over', 'own', 'feet', 'film', 'much', 'build', 'up', 'when', 'build', 'up', 'well', 'done', 'absolutely', 'blow', 'viewer', 'away', 'ending', 'whole', 'film', 'be', 'naught', 'When', 'ending', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', 'really', 'why', 'robbers', 'went', 'trouble', 'are', 'minor', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', 'explain', 'just', 'not', 'extent', 'was', 'expecting', 'hoping', 'best', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'Inside', 'Man', 'definitely', 'recommendation', 'be', 'forewarned', 'film', 'ultimately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'own', 'cleverness']",N/A

He eventually discovers why that particular bank was selected.

1002915,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000GFLKEY,Alistair McHarg,"[10, 18]","Spike Lee was once ""the Great White Hope.""  American liberal intellectuals were ready to lionize a young black filmmaker qualified to ""speak"" for black America.  And he tried.  Regrettably, movies like She's Gotta Have It, Do The Right Thing, School Daze, and Jungle Fever - though interesting as only worthy failures can be, were so self-congratulatory and preachy that they resembled A/V Op-Ed pieces more than movies.Powered by a great true story and towering performance by Denzel Washington, Spike Lee did hit it out of the park once, with Malcolm X, since then it's been a pretty bleak season for the alleged vunderkind.With the Inside Man, Lee ventures into uncharted territory - an exciting, action picture with an interesting psychological twist.  To say he fails is to say the Germans lost WWII.  This failure is made even more remarkable considering how much help he has.  As with Malcolm X, the budget is lavish - this is a dressy film to watch.  Marquee talent is everywhere, Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Willem Dafoe, even Jodie Foster.  With talent like this, only an idiot could go wrong, right?  But Lee is a very special idiot, and he manages.Despite all the hoopla, this is a one-gadget movie, and by the time it arrives you'll be wondering if Reno 911 is on.  Not since the days of Marcel Marceau has anyone does less with less.  Christopher Plummer looks great and gives a splendid performance, but unless his character became a bank president at 12, the entire premise of the movie is blown.  Without that, the logic, motivation, and righteous indignation required to give this film any credibility at all are gone.The turgid pace of this anti-thriller gives Lee plenty of time to indulge in the sort of simplistic, heavy-handed lecturing for which he is known ad nauseum.  A little boy and his video game, ""never forget"" wall posters, a man and his turban, even breast size, all provide opportunities for Lee to beat his audience in the face.Of all this film's shortcomings, the complete squandering of Jodie Foster is most puzzling.  One imagines she doesn't work for free, and yet her character floats in and out of the action completely unexplained.  Washington makes the most of a bad situation, and Clive Owen, an exceptional actor, tries hard to carry the freight.

1002917,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000GFLKEY,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","This film feels off when you compare it to the other films given to us by Spike Lee.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing (we all know that I am not the biggest Spike Lee fan) but the fact that it doesn't truly feel like a Spike Lee film is significant.  Sure, Lee inserts his views on race relations when he has the chance (please get off it for once) but the brisk pace and overall plot development feel like something far removed from director Spike Lee.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing to the viewer is entirely up to that individual.Personally I found the pacing a welcomed change.  It was easier to follow and more engaging than some of Lee's more preachy endeavors, and while it lacks the depth and pristine command that Lee exhibited in `25th Hour' it manages to keep my interest throughout.I was entertained.At the films open we are introduced to Dalton Russell.  Pay close attention for he chooses his words carefully.  He basically tells you all the films secrets in the opening scene, but you won't get it, at least not yet.  He is going to rob a bank.  Next thing you know the bank is sealed and Dalton and his accomplices take everyone hostage, making them don jumpsuits and stripping them of their cell phones and keys.  Outside the bank Detective Keith Frazier (in search of a promotion) takes on the task of negotiating the safety of the hostages with Dalton, but there is no outsmarting that man who has no doubt thought this through.Sadly, it feels at times like the screenwriter didn't do the same.  There are plot holes that stick out like sore thumbs, especially as the plot twists start revealing themselves.  The side plot involving Arthur Case (the bank owner) and the `fixer' he hires is a tad convoluted and needed a little tweaking.  Parts of the execution regarding Dalton's escape are also a bit of a stretch, but it's nothing that takes away from the enjoyment of the film.Just don't think about it too hard.The performances are a delight here though.  Clive Owen is a very effective actor who has consistently presented himself wonderfully on screen.  He's able to engage the audience from the moment he opens his mouth (that voice) but he also has the ability to sustain our attention with the light in his eyes.  Denzel Washington was a nice surprise here as well.  He was able to keep his charm controlled as apposed to allowing it to run wild as he often does.  This is probably one of his better performances, for he found the proper balance in his style of acting.  Christopher Plummer does what he can with his character, and he does it very well; but he is upstaged (as is everyone) by Jodie Foster.  Seriously, what in the world has she been doing?  Where was this amazing and commanding force back when she was winning Oscars for performances that were beneath her obviously?  I mean what she does here is leagues ahead of a lot of her more acclaimed performances.LOVED IT!!!In the end `Inside Man' is a very interesting and enjoyable heist film.  It is not as smart as it appears to be, nor as intelligent as it wants to be, but it is as fun as it claims to be so check it out.  The performances and the quick paced action will keep you glued even if the films preposterousness wages war on you later on.  Just turn your mind off for a few hours and enjoy a good popcorn flick.",4,"It's lacking some, but it makes up for it elsewhere...",1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,3332,"['film', 'feels', 'off', 'when', 'compare', 'other', 'films', 'given', 'Spike', 'Lee', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'thing', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'biggest', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'fan', 'fact', ""n't"", 'truly', 'feel', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'significant', 'Sure', 'Lee', 'views', 'race', 'relations', 'when', 'chance', 'please', 'get', 'off', 'once', 'brisk', 'pace', 'overall', 'plot', 'development', 'feel', 'something', 'far', 'removed', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'thing', 'viewer', 'entirely', 'individual.Personally', 'found', 'pacing', 'welcomed', 'change', 'was', 'easier', 'follow', 'more', 'engaging', 'Lee', 'more', 'preachy', 'endeavors', 'depth', 'pristine', 'command', 'Lee', 'exhibited', '25th', 'Hour', 'keep', 'interest', 'throughout.I', 'was', 'entertained.At', 'films', 'are', 'introduced', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'words', 'carefully', 'basically', 'films', 'secrets', 'opening', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'least', 'not', 'yet', 'going', 'rob', 'bank', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'bank', 'sealed', 'Dalton', 'accomplices', 'take', 'everyone', 'hostage', 'making', 'don', 'jumpsuits', 'stripping', 'cell', 'phones', 'keys', 'bank', 'Detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'search', 'promotion', 'task', 'negotiating', 'safety', 'hostages', 'Dalton', 'outsmarting', 'man', 'who', 'doubt', 'thought', 'through.Sadly', 'times', 'screenwriter', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'same', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'stick', 'out', 'sore', 'thumbs', 'especially', 'plot', 'twists', 'start', 'revealing', 'side', 'plot', 'involving', 'Arthur', 'Case', 'bank', 'owner', 'fixer', 'tad', 'convoluted', 'needed', 'little', 'tweaking', 'Parts', 'execution', 'regarding', 'Dalton', 'escape', 'are', 'also', 'bit', 'stretch', 'nothing', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'film.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'hard.The', 'performances', 'are', 'delight', 'here', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'very', 'effective', 'actor', 'who', 'consistently', 'presented', 'wonderfully', 'screen', 'able', 'engage', 'audience', 'moment', 'mouth', 'voice', 'also', 'ability', 'sustain', 'attention', 'light', 'eyes', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'charm', 'controlled', 'as', 'apposed', 'allowing', 'run', 'wild', 'often', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'found', 'proper', 'balance', 'style', 'acting', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'what', 'can', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'upstaged', 'everyone', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Seriously', 'what', 'world', 'been', 'doing', 'Where', 'was', 'amazing', 'commanding', 'force', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'winning', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'were', 'obviously', 'mean', 'what', 'here', 'leagues', 'ahead', 'lot', 'more', 'acclaimed', 'performances.LOVED', 'IT', 'end', 'Man', 'very', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'heist', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'smart', 'be', 'as', 'intelligent', 'be', 'as', 'fun', 'be', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'performances', 'quick', 'paced', 'action', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'even', 'films', 'preposterousness', 'wages', 'war', 'later', 'Just', 'turn', 'mind', 'few', 'hours', 'enjoy', 'good', 'popcorn', 'flick']",N/A

1002924,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000GFLKEY,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","Is INSIDE MAN supposed to be a mindlessly stimulating bank heist film? Or a thought-provoking take on urbanism, race, money, power, and history? Blending the two would've been a spectacular feat, but INSIDE MAN too often misses the mark or simply stretches credibility to the breaking point.The story starts like a basic heist flick but with a few subtle quirks. Clive Owen stars as bank robber genius Dalton Russell who takes over a bank in Manhattan, hostages and all. But why he's there is the big running question. He makes no move to dash in and out with the money, and seems content to sit and wait out the police.Enter Denzel Washington as Junior Detective Keith Frazer. Being a hostage negotiator, the detective decides to play by the book, waiting out Dalton's gang and making false promises of arriving buses and planes. But Detective Frazer soon realizes that something is amiss. Dalton is delaying everything, too. And none of the hostages have been killed, even when deadline demands come and go.Into the fray comes Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, the banks founder. He has secrets in a safety deposit box that he'll do anything to keep secret. In rapid (and confusing) fashion, he contacts Madeline White (Jodi Foster, FLIGHTPLAN ), a woman who has contacts in high places and can usually get whatever a client wants. Bending the ear of the mayor, Ms. White gets on the inside with the police and secures a private meeting with Dalton, who quickly advises her that he's already opened Mr. Case's safety deposit box and retrieved ....Okay, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag.Suffice to say there are good qualities about the film (thus my positive rating). The acting is spot-on perfect (from Willem Dafoe's grumpy street cop persona to Clive Owen's questionable bank robber status). Filming was exceptional with director Spike Lee incorporating the darkness inside the bank in contrast to the white masks of the hostage-takers/robbers (White masks? Hmm. Think he's trying to tell us something?) The movie's pace was satisfactory, too. It perhaps got bogged down in some of the overly-developed plot devices that were extraneous or outlandish (the cops would NEVER let a citizen -- Foster -- into the bank with armed suspects regardless of her contacts).There are also a lot of irritatingly undeveloped items. Most notably were Jodi Foster's character and the basis for Clive Owen's gang. There is no history surrounding Foster's character so we don't know how she got started in this business (whatever her ""business"" was) nor how Christopher Plummer's character knows how to get ahold of her. Clive Owen's gang must've been some sort of modern day Nurembergers, still tracking down Nazi and Nazi sympathizers, but why and where they came from remains a mystery throughout.In recent typical Hollywood fashion, the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys are better than all. Christopher Plummer plays the dark figure we so love to see him play that it is, unfortunately, almost a clich&eacute;. Denzel is the black detective trying to advance his career while at the same time battling prejudice within his own department (another clich&eacute;?).Still, it was fun to watch. The fact that there's really no bloodshed makes this bank heist film unique by current day standards. Most have explosions with bodies flying through the air and clip after clip after clip of ammo being loosed. Not here.If you've got a few hours to kill at home, you might consider plopping this into your DVD player and checking it out.

1002932,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B000GFLKEY,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[1, 2]","Inside Man is not a clear cut story of good guys and bad guys, although it starts out that way. Inside Man dares, in the post 9-11 era, to depict a group of terrorists in New York City with a morally ambiguous, possibly even compelling motive, and whose motto might well be ""We Will Never Forget"".Criminal mastermind Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) remarks that ""Respect is the ultimate currency, "" and ""If you love each other, money really shouldn't matter."" Why? The giant ""We Will Never Forget"" banner sprawls across the screen several times, and forms the subtext of this entire story. But if you don't understand the duality of that banner, you're not grasping what this movie is all about.There's a lot more here than first meets the eye. Inside Man takes the heist film to another level, leaving ""terrorist"" thrillers like ""Die Hard"" in the dust, with the most ingenious heist plot going, period -- a killer cast, a wonderful score, fabulous camera work (some mind-bending, big budget crane shots -- they make those moves look so easy but they're not!), crackling Mamet-grade dialogue, and a distinctive flash-forward editing style that actually helps viewer understanding and is a hallmark of the film's unique, hip style, courtesy of director Spike Lee.The ""victim"", bank chairman Arthur Case, impeccably played by the avuncular and agreeable Christopher Plummer, is a man with Nazi genocide in his past. The chief bank robber, performed ""to perfection"" by Clive Owen, is looking to enrich himself but also to reveal crimes against humanity. In a puzzling and peculiar fashion he is to us both a hero and a thief. Jodie Foster as Madeleine White is the perpetually smiling fixer working for the bank chairman, trying to insure a good political outcome for her client. Denzel Washington as Detective Frazier heads the cast as the straight man cop trying to figure out what the heck is going on here. And no one is quite what they seem.With a philanthrophic bank executive as it's central villain, I-M is perhaps more timely and topical now than when it was first released in 2005. I particularly enjoyed how Madeleine White gets under the mayor's (and Arthur Case's) skin -- and the extremely smart bit where those characters, once out of the public eye, suddenly change their conversation in the blink of an eye from philanthropy to the lobbyist's language of coercion.Like a mandela, the layers of good and evil, truth and lies, weave in and out on multiple levels. Much like life, nothing is as simple or clear cut as it seems.There were many ways the events in this film could have unfolded to us. The timeline of the film is mostly linear, except for the ""flash-forward"", somewhat solarized hostage interviews which, positioned as they are, serve an intercutting function and break up the action nicely. The interrogations of the ex-hostages are terribly important because, after all, that's how the cops think they're going to break the case -- by finding the inside man. But if the hostage interviews had been piled up at the end of the movie, they would have been too much all at once and brought the movie to a stop.Aside from the highly motivated characters, this film has a tremendous sense of humor and irony, and most of it comes out in the fact that the hostages are humiliated and bullied by the robbers AND the police. It is, in fact, the police who shoot rubber bullets at the hostages -- the robbers never fire a shot from their toy guns.As a footnote, the main and end title designs were very nicely done, and in a rarity, the end credits depict all the orchestral players by instrument.

Yet she still walks away with a paycheck after abundantly flaunting her VIP status and hinting that she has secret talents we can only guess at (cat-throwing?). Worst of all (from a moral point of view, since the movie does seem to have moral pretensions) is that the villain's evil past is a simple ""MacGuffin"", a trivial plot device, used to justify our sitting through yet another heist film.

The attempted bank heist scenario is sort of like ""Dog Day Afternoon"" but these crooks are much calmer and better prepared than Al Pacino and company.

The owner of box 392 is Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), chairman of the bank and a wealthy, respected Jewish man who got rich selling out his fellow Jews to the Nazis during World War II. Case, in turn, hires Madeline White (Jodie Foster), a shadowy figure with big time connections, to help prevent his secret from being exposed. From here the plot gets very convoluted. But ends up with the bank robbers escaping and Arthur Case possibly being turned in to the War Crimes Office in Washington DC.The movie was directed, of course, by Spike Lee. And he does manage to do some things well. For example, Lee does an exceptional job of capturing the essence of New York City, in all its foul mouthed, ethnically diverse, hustle and bustle glory. Race is always a major theme in Lee's films and here he explores it through several characters representing some of America's lesser known ethnicities, a Sikh, an Albanian, etc. Unfortunately, Lee's portrayal of these people is pretty stereotypical and attempts to make fun of them. Not exactly the voice of racial tolerance and respect here. I have always appreciated that Lee is one of the leading black voices that speaks up against the media's glamorization of violence and crime in the African-American community. But his weak attempt to blame video games for these problems is quite exaggerated and silly. I also was dissapointed by the lack of character development in this movie. The bank robbers, besides Russell, are virtually anonymous and the hostages wear masks through most of the movie. Only Denzel's Detective Frazier character is at all built upon. But his slickster style, obsession with his own career advancement and ridiculously sexual conversations with his girlfriend, while on the job, make him seem more like an obnoxious, unprofessional jerk than a serious detective attempting to save the hostages' lives and thwart the bank heist. The movie's theme seems to revolve around the idea that all of a person's lies and misdeeds eventually catch up to them. But this is not at all reinforced by the many morally ambivalent characters who seem to be only out for themselves and doing quite well at it. Finally, the film ends with a lot of ""loose ends"" in the plot line that really never are made clear. So, all in all, there are just too many problems with this movie for me to be able to recommend it. But Lee's unique talent and personal style still manage to raise it at least slightly above the typical brainless Hollywood action flick.",3,"Spike Lee Attempts To Make A Bank Heist Thriller, But With Limited Success",1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,3054,"['Detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'brought', 'chief', 'negotiater', 'following', 'bank', 'robbery', 'involving', 'hostages', 'attempted', 'bank', 'heist', 'scenario', 'sort', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'crooks', 'are', 'much', 'calmer', 'better', 'prepared', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'company', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'robbery', 'eye', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'partners', 'are', 'involved', 'complicated', 'scheme', 'gain', 'access', 'safety', 'deposit', 'box', '392', 'huge', 'diamond', 'ring', 'potentially', 'humilating', 'secret', 'owner', 'box', '392', 'Arthur', 'Case', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'chairman', 'bank', 'wealthy', 'respected', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'rich', 'selling', 'out', 'fellow', 'Jews', 'Nazis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Case', 'turn', 'Madeline', 'White', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'big', 'time', 'connections', 'help', 'prevent', 'secret', 'being', 'exposed', 'here', 'plot', 'very', 'convoluted', 'up', 'bank', 'robbers', 'escaping', 'Arthur', 'Case', 'possibly', 'being', 'turned', 'War', 'Crimes', 'Office', 'Washington', 'DC.The', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'course', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'manage', 'do', 'things', 'well', 'example', 'Lee', 'exceptional', 'job', 'capturing', 'essence', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'ethnically', 'diverse', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'glory', 'Race', 'always', 'major', 'theme', 'Lee', 'films', 'here', 'several', 'characters', 'representing', 'America', 'lesser', 'known', 'ethnicities', 'Sikh', 'Albanian', 'etc', 'Unfortunately', 'Lee', 'portrayal', 'people', 'pretty', 'stereotypical', 'attempts', 'make', 'fun', 'Not', 'exactly', 'voice', 'racial', 'tolerance', 'respect', 'here', 'have', 'always', 'appreciated', 'Lee', 'one', 'leading', 'black', 'voices', 'up', 'media', 'glamorization', 'violence', 'crime', 'African-American', 'community', 'weak', 'attempt', 'blame', 'video', 'games', 'problems', 'quite', 'exaggerated', 'silly', 'also', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'bank', 'robbers', 'besides', 'Russell', 'are', 'virtually', 'anonymous', 'hostages', 'wear', 'masks', 'most', 'movie', 'Only', 'Denzel', 'Detective', 'Frazier', 'character', 'built', 'slickster', 'style', 'obsession', 'own', 'career', 'advancement', 'ridiculously', 'sexual', 'conversations', 'girlfriend', 'job', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'unprofessional', 'jerk', 'serious', 'detective', 'attempting', 'save', 'hostages', 'lives', 'thwart', 'bank', 'heist', 'movie', 'theme', 'revolve', 'idea', 'person', 'lies', 'misdeeds', 'eventually', 'catch', 'up', 'not', 'reinforced', 'many', 'morally', 'ambivalent', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'out', 'doing', 'quite', 'well', 'Finally', 'film', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'plot', 'line', 'really', 'never', 'are', 'made', 'clear', 'So', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'movie', 'be', 'able', 'recommend', 'Lee', 'unique', 'talent', 'personal', 'style', 'still', 'manage', 'raise', 'least', 'slightly', 'typical', 'brainless', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'flick']",N/A

1002947,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B000GFLKEY,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[4, 9]","I was not impressed by 'Inside Man' at all; in fact I thought it was below average.  Spike Lee ruined the film by trying to sell a political message about tolerance and equality wrapped up in a long, drawn out and anti-climactic crime caper and it just did not work.While I have nothing against the message that Spike almost always puts into his films, I just felt that the context of this film was inappropriate for the type of movie that Spike is known for making, primarily because the political message overshadowed the main plot of the film, which was the bank robbery.  As it turns out, the movie is nothing like what the trailers leads one to believe, in fact the bank robbery and the hostage negotiation process takes a backseat in a sense to the underlying theme of the film which was bringing awareness to racial inequality and correcting the sins of the past and that actually plays a part in the motive behind the robbery as well.The story itself was not all that intriguing, and the presentation of it was sort of a mess that seemed thrown together at the last minute.  It starts off with a straightforward story with the robbers entering the bank and quickly the audience learns the means by which they will get away with their crime, and even though it has been seen before in other films, it's a rather ingenious escape plan.  Later on though they begin with quick jumps into the future showing interviews with some of the freed hostages, and then all of a sudden they jump back into real time as Denzel's character is attempting to negotiate with the hostages.  It wasn't confusing as much as it was distracting, breaking up the momentum of the robbery and the standoff with the police.  Sprinkled throughout there were people of various ethnic backgrounds and they raised the issue of being harassed by cops because of their looks, and there was heavy emphasis put on these aspects.  Some of the cops were racist due to their jobs dealing with criminals of various backgrounds, and this conflicted with Denzel's character and his partner who were two detectives assigned to the case.  They were actually assigned to the case simply because the main detective was gone on vacation, and there was some initial rejection of them as lead detectives by the primary SWAT cop on the scene played by Willem Dafoe, so once again Spike Lee made ethnicity the main issue.There was a sub-plot involving Jodie Foster as a top-negotiator for the rich and famous, but surprisingly her character was rather minimal and underused.  That was disappointing because she's such a great actress but there was not much for her to work with, and the little that she had seemed kind of pointless even though she worked out a lucrative deal with a couple of key characters.  To be honest, the movie would not have suffered had she not been in it at all.Denzel's character Keith Frazier left much to be desired.  There was not much that I really liked about his character or found intriguing or endearing.  There was not a great deal of depth to him period, which left me not caring one way or another in regards to what happens to him, and his partner Bill Mitchell was even less developed.Then there were the bank robbers, and the only one that was even slightly fleshed out was Clive Owen's Dalton Russell, but by the end of the film, we know next to nothing about who he was or what his motivation was.  Sure, the audience can make an assumption about his role in the bank robbery based on the final outcome, but do we really know his true motivation?  Maybe he was a part of the family, or perhaps he was just a man hired for the job, but it's impossible to say for sure.Christopher Plummer was another actor that more or less wasted his talent in this film because he was the stereotypical rich white man who had stepped on too many toes in his life to get where he was at, and he had attempted to atone for his sins ever since his transgressions took place, yet there was not enough screen time devoted to his character to really give any sense of emotion to his motivation nor his plight to right his grievous wrongs.  Was his motivation explained, yes, but it was miniscule to the point of striking on par.As the movie ends on a less than exciting note, I'm left with a movie that really drags on in the middle with no characters that were engaging in any way, and neither the heroes nor villains had enough idiosyncrasies or dynamic chemistry between them to make it a memorable or entertaining film.  I would not even go as far as saying that it is a film worth watching just to pass time.  The movie felt schizophrenic as in it had two vastly different personalities but not enough personality to make either one a whole person, and there was not enough of a story to keep one's interest throughout and beyond the end credits.Essentially it is an anti-racism movie and also a heist movie, but it never quite becomes either of the two themes and ultimately leaves the audience stranded somewhere in the middle between the two which makes for a very unsatisfying and unfulfilled film that had great potential given the cast, talent and basic premise, leaving much to be desired.",2,'Inside Man' Fails On Multiple Levels,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,5179,"['was', 'not', 'impressed', ""'Inside"", 'Man', 'fact', 'thought', 'was', 'below', 'average', 'Spike', 'Lee',

Lee made effective use of flashforwards in presenting the plot, a cleverly contrived bank robbery that quickly spiraled into a hostage taking standoff.Criminal mastermind Dalton Russell played by Clive Owen led a well trained team into a Manhattan bank where they quickly assumed control.  Forcing the large group of hostages to strip and dress in the same outfits as the robbers, he homogenized the confined group.  Hostage negotiating NYPD detective Keith Frazier played by talented Denzel Washington, a cool cerebral yet compromised investigator owing to a recent bust that went bad, wall called in to deal with Owen.The bank was owned by Jewish chairman of the board Arthur Case played by veteran Christopher Plummer.  Plummer was prepared to go to great lengths to maintain secrecy of his affairs which were documented within a safety deposit box located at the bank.  Plummer had been a Nazi collaborator against his own people harvesting untold riches which he used to start his banking empire.  As a result, Plummer called in smug and refined power broker Madeleine White played by Jodie Foster to help maintain secrecy while she negotiated with Owen.We soon see that there is an ulterior motive to the affair as Owen appears to be stalling for time.

Among the ""twists"" are (1) a bank president who hires someone to try to get something NOT robbed out of his band during the heist, evidence that could destroy his status and career, and (2) the crooks all get away with the mastermind of group hiding in the bank for a week before slipping away in broad daylight. That last part leads me to ask a few questions about that could possibly happen, specifically how get could get out of the vault where he was hidden without all kinds of alarms going off, etc.Nevertheless, credibility-aside, its an interesting two hours of entertainment, sort of a modern-day Dog Day Afternoon film. (In fact, DDA is mentioned in the movie.)The four lead actors in this film are all quite diverse: a veteran cop (Denzel Washington), the main crook (Clive Owen), the bank president (Christopher Plummer) and the professional business woman he hires (Jodie Foster.) All of them are fascinating, thanks in large part to the fact they are all outstanding actors to begin with.

1002952,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000GFLKEY,Craig Matteson,"[2, 2]","I have said it before, and it remains true: I enjoy every second when I see Denzel Washington on the screen.  He is about as engaging an actor as there is.  Yet he keeps each character fresh and different.  True, I enjoy some performances more than others and some of the films he is in I can't even work myself up to seeing.  But when I do, he is always most engaging.  This is a movie I would not have watched except that he is in it.  I had heard less than enthusiastic things about it, but decided to give it a try.  After all, if Denzel is in it, well, it has to have some redeeming qualities.So, how was it?  Well, while I was watching it I was quite engaged.  The actors are all very good and give more than fine performances.  And I think Spike Lee has done a terrific job in putting this film together.  After it is over, and you think back on aspects of the plot, which I will not go into here, because you shouldn't know any more going in than it is a bank robbery, you will realize that Lee has pulled a big rabbit out of a very small hat.I have already said that Denzel's performance as Det. Keith Frazier is terrific.  His partner, Det. Bill Mitchell is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, whom I first noticed as ""The Operative"" in ""Serenity"".  He is just as engaging here in a vastly different role.  Jodie Foster is another of my favorites, and she does very well with what she is given here.  But here role here is more like the function of a magician's assistant than a protagonist.  Her character, Madeline White, allows the paranoids in the audience to believe this is how the broader culture actually works and White allows certain points of exposition to happen rather than having any real payoff.  I am saying that I still love Jodie Foster, but this role was a dud DESPITE her fine acting.Arthur Case, played by the great Christopher Plummer, is not quite believable because he would have to be about twenty years older than Plummer is and would have to have made some decades long very stupid choices for no explicable reasons in order for this plot to work.  Clive Owen is the other main character, Dalton Russell.  He has a hard job because in most of the movie his face and body are mostly covered.  I still don't know how Owen's character learned enough to target what he was after in this movie.  If he had discovered the materials and objects by accident, that would have been different.  But the plot has him going only after these items.  We can project motives on him afterwards, but I don't recall the movie making clear how he gained the intelligence and what his motivation actually was for such a difficult and risky crime.Anyway, a decent heist film while you watch it.  I just don't recommend thinking about it too much along the way or afterwards.",4,"If you can avoid thinking about it, a pretty enjoyable heist film",1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,2781,"['have', 'said', 'true', 'enjoy', 'second', 'when', 'see', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'screen', 'about', 'engaging', 'actor', 'character', 'fresh', 'different', 'True', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'more', 'others', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'work', 'up', 'seeing', 'when', 'do', 'always', 'most', 'engaging', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'watched', 'had', 'heard', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'things', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'Denzel', 'well', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities.So', 'how', 'was', 'Well', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'quite', 'engaged', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'give', 'more', 'fine', 'performances', 'think', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'done', 'terrific', 'job', 'putting', 'film', 'together', 'think', 'back', 'aspects', 'plot', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'here', 'should', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'going', 'bank', 'robbery', 'will', 'realize', 'Lee', 'pulled', 'big', 'rabbit', 'very', 'small', 'hat.I', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'Denzel', 'performance', 'Det', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'terrific', 'partner', 'Det', 'Bill', 'Mitchell', 'played', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'whom', 'first', 'noticed', 'Operative', 'Serenity', 'just', 'engaging', 'here', 'vastly', 'different', 'role', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'favorites', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'given', 'here', 'here', 'role', 'here', 'more', 'function', 'magician', 'assistant', 'protagonist', 'character', 'Madeline', 'White', 'paranoids', 'audience', 'believe', 'how', 'broader', 'culture', 'actually', 'White', 'certain', 'points', 'exposition', 'happen', 'rather', 'having', 'real', 'payoff', 'am', 'saying', 'still', 'love', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'role', 'was', 'dud', 'DESPITE', 'fine', 'acting.Arthur', 'Case', 'played', 'great', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'not', 'quite', 'believable', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'twenty', 'years', 'older', 'Plummer', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'made', 'decades', 'long', 'very', 'stupid', 'choices', 'explicable', 'reasons', 'order', 'plot', 'work', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'hard', 'job', 'most', 'movie', 'face', 'body', 'are', 'mostly', 'covered', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Owen', 'character', 'learned', 'enough', 'target', 'what', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'discovered', 'materials', 'objects', 'accident', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'plot', 'going', 'only', 'items', 'can', 'project', 'motives', 'afterwards', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'movie', 'making', 'clear', 'how', 'gained', 'intelligence', 'what', 'motivation', 'actually', 'was', 'such', 'difficult', 'risky', 'crime.Anyway', 'decent', 'heist', 'film', 'watch', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'thinking', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'afterwards']",N/A
1002953,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000GFLKEY,Cubist,"[5, 6]","Spike Lee is the last filmmaker you'd imagine making a slick heist film for a major studio and yet that is exactly what he's done with Inside Man, a cleverly staged and executed thriller. What's even more incredible is that this intricately plotted movie was written by first timer Russell Gewirtz. Lee fans worried that he's sold out can rest assured that even though the filmmaker is working for a studio this is hardly your average director-for-hire gig. And, as if to reassure his fans, Lee has teamed up with Denzel Washington again - always a good sign as they work so well together (this being their fourth collaboration).Washington plays a smooth talking smart guy who is trying to figure out what the bank robbers, in particular Russell, are up to while dealing with influential bureaucrats, like White, breathing down his neck. He displays the ease and confidence of an actor in top form and is wonderful, as always, to watch. Clive Owen is also very good as the ruthless bank robber with a keen intellect. Is he messing with the cops? Is he following some sort of ingenious master plan? Both? It's an interesting role for the actor as he spends a good chunk of the movie with his marquee good looks obscured by a mask.One of the joys of watching Inside Man is seeing all of these A-listers interact with each other; all under Lee's expert direction. The plotting is complex and brilliant as Gewirtz puts a new spin on the ""perfect crime"" while also paying homage to other heist movies like Dog Day Afternoon and Quick Change. Best of all, like The Usual Suspects, he ends the film with a delicious twist that is extremely hard to predict. Inside Man is a solid, thoroughly entertaining thriller with a brain - a rarity in Hollywood these days.There are five deleted scenes that include more footage of Frazier and Mitchell interrogating the hostages and how they perceived what went down. There is also an amusing scene where Frazier and Mitchell discuss the meaning behind a Bob Marley song and also a collection of local news reports on the bank heist.""The Making of Inside Man"" is a pleasant notch above the usual electronic press kit material. Producer Brian Grazer provided the director a way to work successfully with a studio, which he hadn't done for some time. Also included are excerpts from a cast script read-through and rehearsals that sheds a little light on the creative process.In what is quite possibly the most enjoyable extra on this disc, ""Number 4"" is a lively conversation between Lee and Washington about the four films they've done together. You can tell that they're good friends by the way they joke with each other in a relaxed manner. This is a fun, engaging extra.Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Spike Lee. For a director it's all about making choices and Lee talks about particular shots in the movie and why he chose them. He speaks fondly of the cast without being to sycophantic about it. This isn't the chattiest track ever recorded but Lee talks enough to make it worth a listen if you're a fan of the man and his movies.",5,An entertaining and engaging heist thriller,1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,3085,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'last', 'filmmaker', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'making', 'slick', 'heist', 'film', 'major', 'studio', 'yet', 'exactly', 'what', 'done', 'Inside', 'Man', 'cleverly', 'staged', 'executed', 'thriller', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'incredible', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'first', 'timer', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'Lee', 'fans', 'worried', 'sold', 'out', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'even', 'filmmaker', 'working', 'studio', 'hardly', 'average', 'director-for-hire', 'gig', 'reassure', 'fans', 'Lee', 'teamed', 'up', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'again', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'being', 'fourth', 'collaboration', '.Washington', 'smooth', 'talking', 'smart', 'guy', 'who', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'bank', 'robbers', 'particular', 'Russell', 'are', 'up', 'dealing', 'influential', 'bureaucrats', 'White', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'ease', 'confidence', 'actor', 'top', 'form', 'wonderful', 'always', 'watch', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'ruthless', 'bank', 'robber', 'keen', 'intellect', 'messing', 'cops', 'following', 'sort', 'ingenious', 'master', 'plan', 'interesting', 'role', 'actor', 'good', 'chunk', 'movie', 'marquee', 'good', 'looks', 'obscured', 'mask.One', 'joys', 'watching', 'Inside', 'Man', 'seeing', 'A-listers', 'interact', 'other', 'Lee', 'expert', 'direction', 'plotting', 'complex', 'brilliant', 'Gewirtz', 'new', 'spin', 'perfect', 'crime', 'also', 'paying', 'homage', 'other', 'heist', 'movies', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Quick', 'Change', 'Best', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'film', 'delicious', 'twist', 'extremely', 'hard', 'predict', 'Inside', 'Man', 'solid', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'brain', 'rarity', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'more', 'footage', 'Frazier', 'Mitchell', 'interrogating', 'hostages', 'how', 'perceived', 'what', 'went', 'down', 'also', 'amusing', 'scene', 'where', 'Frazier', 'Mitchell', 'discuss', 'meaning', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'song', 'also', 'collection', 'local', 'news', 'reports', 'bank', 'heist', 'Making', 'Inside', 'Man', 'pleasant', 'notch', 'usual', 'electronic', 'press', 'kit', 'material', 'Producer', 'Brian', 'Grazer', 'provided', 'director', 'way', 'work', 'successfully', 'studio', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'time', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'excerpts', 'cast', 'script', 'read-through', 'rehearsals', 'little', 'light', 'creative', 'process.In', 'what', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'extra', 'disc', 'Number', '4', 'lively', 'conversation', 'Lee', 'Washington', 'four', 'films', ""'ve"", 'done', 'together', 'can', 'tell', ""'re"", 'good', 'friends', 'way', 'joke', 'other', 'relaxed', 'manner', 'fun', 'engaging', 'extra.Finally', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'director', 'making', 'choices', 'Lee', 'talks', 'particular', 'shots', 'movie', 'why', 'chose', 'fondly', 'cast', 'being', 'sycophantic', ""n't"", 'chattiest', 'track', 'ever', 'recorded', 'Lee', 'talks', 'enough', 'make', 'listen', ""'re"", 'fan', 'man', 'movies']",N/A

Probably the last thing one would expect of Mr. Lee is that he would direct a thriller, but he has given us one of the best in recent memory.This is a film that keeps you on the edge; you are not sure where it is going to go next.  The battle of wits between Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) is like a chess game with each plotting strategy and sometimes finding they have been outwitted.  Both Washington and Owen are excellent in their roles and truly convince you that they are a detective and bank robber.  Jody Foster is also excellent as Madeline White, a kind of corporate enforcer who is hired to look after the interests of wealthy banker Arthur Chase (Christopher Plummer), who has something in a safe deposit box that needs to stay put.  Ms. Foster plays her roll coolly with the knowledge that she can convince anyone to do what she wants.  Her character clearly has either good political connections or enough dirt on people to get what she wants when she wants it.  She manages to twist the Mayor into letting her in to negotiate with Dalton Russell with him clearly being blackmailed into allowing it.Willem Dafoe is good as a police captain but does not have enough screen time to make an impression.  One wonders how much of his part made it into the final cut.  Christopher Plummer is also excellent in his characterization of Arthur Chase, who in old age is regretful of what he has done in his past but not about to repent.  I liked Mr. Plummer's final scene in the film where he is paying Jody Foster for her successfully keeping his name clean.  When she says more to his face than he likes it is interesting to see Plummer wanting to say something in return but keeping the words to himself.The screenplay is the first from Russell Gewirtz and is impressive in the way he always keeps us guessing what is coming next and not resolving the story until the last scene of the film.",5,One of the Best Thrillers,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,2079,"['have', 'liked', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'films', 'years', 'found', 'Inside', 'Man', 'be', 'refreshing', 'addition', 'long', 'list', 'excellent', 'films', 'Probably', 'last', 'thing', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'would', 'direct', 'thriller', 'given', 'one', 'best', 'recent', 'memory.This', 'film', 'edge', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'going', 'go', 'next', 'battle', 'wits', 'Detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'chess', 'game', 'plotting', 'strategy', 'sometimes', 'finding', 'have', 'been', 'outwitted', 'Washington', 'Owen', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'truly', 'convince', 'are', 'detective', 'bank', 'robber', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'also', 'excellent', 'Madeline', 'White', 'kind', 'corporate', 'enforcer', 'who', 'hired', 'look', 'interests', 'wealthy', 'banker', 'Arthur', 'Chase', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'who', 'something', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'stay', 'put', 'Ms.', 'Foster', 'roll', 'coolly', 'knowledge', 'can', 'convince', 'anyone', 'do', 'what', 'character', 'clearly', 'either', 'good', 'political', 'connections', 'enough', 'dirt', 'people', 'get', 'what', 'when', 'twist', 'Mayor', 'letting', 'negotiate', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'clearly', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'allowing', 'it.Willem', 'Dafoe', 'good', 'police', 'captain', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'impression', 'One', 'how', 'much', 'part', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'also', 'excellent', 'characterization', 'Arthur', 'Chase', 'who', 'old', 'age', 'regretful', 'what', 'done', 'past', 'not', 'repent', 'liked', 'Mr.', 'Plummer', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'paying', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'successfully', 'keeping', 'name', 'clean', 'When', 'more', 'face', 'interesting', 'see', 'Plummer', 'wanting', 'say', 'something', 'return', 'keeping', 'words', 'himself.The', 'screenplay', 'first', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'impressive', 'way', 'always', 'guessing', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'not', 'resolving', 'story', 'last', 'scene', 'film']",N/A

1002964,A20Q4HD6A2B8W9,B000GFLKEY,Dennis Brandt,"[1, 4]","It doesn't quite come off thanks to Spike Lee's heavy-handed cutting.  The premise is farfetched but could carry an entertaining film if handled well.  After all, this is not a documentary.  Instead, Lee threw in numerous flash-forwards that partly give away the ending.  He would have had a better film had he kept them in chronological order.  Lee obviously wanted more of it.  The disc's special features contain a lengthy series of quickstep police interviews that mercifully hit the cutting room floor.  One flash-forward even details events that never occur, which only serves to confuse.As to Jodie Foster, her character was well acted - as expected - but never seemed relevant or believable.  Where does her power come from?  We never learn that.  Police will not permit a civilian to enter a deadly situation in the manner in which this film portrays, if ever.  Yes, the mayor was pulling the strings because Lee always has to include an establishment conspiracy.  Even in Malcolm X, where we know the killers were disgruntled Muslims, he has to have a police car slide by at the eleventh hour to imply conspiracy.  There were other ways of dealing with the Christopher Plummer character's nefarious dealings with the Nazis.Last, there is Lee's penchant for using the ""F"" word as often as possible.  I know what the reaction will be from all of you who can't live without using it three times in every sentence, but it only detracts from the film.  It's just a thrown-in word to . . . What?  Shock?  Hardly by this time.  Just annoy those of us whose vocabularies exceed street level.  Critic Wesley Morris said that Lee instills the film ""with grit, comedy, and a ton of New York ethnic personality.""  If so, New York is not a nice place to visit, and I sure wouldn't want to live there.  Do people say the word?  Of course.  Does it add to the film's realism?  You premise a film on a farfetched plot and then want to swear to add realism?  Justifying the ""F"" word as a tool of realism is an excuse producers use to appeal to a younger, more vocabulary-challenged moviegoer.",3,"Great cast, fascinating premise, but . . .",1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,2085,"[""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'off', 'thanks', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'heavy-handed', 'cutting', 'premise', 'farfetched', 'could', 'carry', 'entertaining', 'film', 'handled', 'well', 'not', 'documentary', 'Instead', 'Lee', 'threw', 'numerous', 'flash-forwards', 'partly', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'kept', 'chronological', 'order', 'Lee', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'more', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'contain', 'lengthy', 'series', 'quickstep', 'police', 'interviews', 'mercifully', 'hit', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'One', 'flash-forward', 'even', 'details', 'events', 'never', 'occur', 'only', 'confuse.As', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'character', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'expected', 'never', 'seemed', 'relevant', 'believable', 'Where', 'power', 'come', 'never', 'learn', 'Police', 'will', 'not', 'permit', 'civilian', 'enter', 'deadly', 'situation', 'manner', 'film', 'ever', 'Yes', 'mayor', 'was', 'pulling', 'strings', 'Lee', 'always', 'include', 'establishment', 'conspiracy', 'Even', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'where', 'know', 'killers', 'were', 'disgruntled', 'Muslims', 'have', 'police', 'car', 'slide', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'imply', 'conspiracy', 'were', 'other', 'ways', 'dealing', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'character', 'nefarious', 'dealings', 'Nazis.Last', 'Lee', 'penchant', 'using', 'F', 'word', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'know', 'what', 'reaction', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'using', 'three', 'times', 'sentence', 'only', 'film', 'just', 'thrown-in', 'word', 'What', 'Shock', 'Hardly', 'time', 'Just', 'vocabularies', 'exceed', 'street', 'level', 'Critic', 'Wesley', 'Morris', 'said', 'Lee', 'film', 'grit', 'comedy', 'ton', 'New', 'York', 'ethnic', 'personality', 'so', 'New', 'York', 'not', 'nice', 'place', 'visit', 'sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'there', 'Do', 'people', 'say', 'word', 'course', 'add', 'film', 'realism', 'premise', 'film', 'farfetched', 'plot', 'then', 'want', 'swear', 'add', 'realism', 'Justifying', 'F', 'word', 'tool', 'realism', 'excuse', 'producers', 'use', 'appeal', 'younger', 'more', 'vocabulary-challenged', 'moviegoer']",N/A

""Inside Man"" is a bank heist film, one of hundreds of films in a moribund corner of the crime film world. It's also a hostage-negotiation film, with Lee's four-time leading man, Denzel Washington, in the role of a police negotiator whose personal life is on the edge: at times he has the tactfulness of a falling anvil, and yet he is smart enough to match wits with the heist's mastermind, intensely played by Clive Owen.The mechanics and motivations of the heist itself are pretty compelling: this looks like a master plan that could work. Where the film fizzles in in the presentation of a plot beyond the clime, and the introduction of a rather ricketty set of circumstances involving municipal and corporate corruption (the bank's CEO is evil, and he leans on the mayor to obstruct the police in the middle of the hostage crisis -- not very likely) Jodie Foster plays a shadow-world heavy, hired by the CEO to make sure that his personal safety deposit box is not opened by the robbers (spoiler alert: it is their target) and, unbelievably, she is given access to the crime scene and spars briefly with Denzel, who despite his character's maverick nature, lets her meet with the bad guys.  This whole meta-plot is a dud -- it just rings false on every level, which is a shame, since the heist itself is kind of exciting.  If Lee had left well enough alone, and just made this an exciting genre film, it would have been fun.  The added-on political commentary seems grafted on and phony, it fails to resonate politically, and it an utter failure in dramatic terms.  That being said, the film is watchable and often engrossing, but it lacks the finesse and intensity of, say, Lee's far superior crime film, ""25.""  It's an okay film, but it lurches to the ending.

Amidst intense negotiation between thw two, power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) enters the picture proving herself to be a better negotiator than Fraizer. But everyone has their motives and the interlocking puzzle gets more complex. As the story unfolds, each turn becomesmore unpredictable.Clive Owen is excellent witty robber who's outpacing everyone at every opportunity. Displaying a level of cool collectedness, Owen was convincing as the potentially violent criminal with a broader agenda in mind.Denzel Washington turns in an equally sublime performance playing the detective who's trying to serve justice while battling investigation for corruption. Detecive Fraizer's urgency in taking Russell to task is well portrayed by Washington.Jodie Foster's Medeline White may just play a supporting role but it's no doubt that the actress can handle any role with aplomb. Her character's brimming with calm confidence trying to secure a deal with the robber while enriching her own pockets.Spike Lee's Inside Man is an exciting thrillers with non-stop action and suspense.

1002974,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000GFLKEY,D. S. Thurlow,"[1, 1]","The 2006 movie ""Inside Man"" would appear to have a lot going for it: a tense plot built around a hostage situation in a New York City bank, a handful of first rate actors, and an accomplished director with a real feel for his native city.  However, this movie might be too clever for its own good.The movie opens with a bank heist that gets interrupted by the police, turning into a hostage situation.  NYPD Detective Frazer (Denzel Washington) gets tagged to be the on-scene negotiator, and runs into trouble dealing with a senior uniformed cop (Willem Dafoe), the leader of the heist crew (Clive Owen), and a high-level New York City fixer (Jodie Foster in serious high heels) dispatched by the bank's owner (Christopher Plummer).  Frazer patiently works the hostage problem while increasingly becoming aware that he is being played.This movie is strongest in its presentation of ""how things get done"" in NYC, with overtones of racial prejudice, official corruption, and deal-making everywhere.  Every principal character is potentially flawed in his or her motivations.  Meanwhile, the tension builds relentlessly toward a crisis point in the hostage negotiations.Unfortunately, the movie undermines its own suspense by telling the story backwards and forwards; the audience knows early on who survives.

1002977,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B000GFLKEY,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[3, 6]","Spike Lee's new film, ""Inside Man,"" stars Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier, a man who would like to move up in the police force.  Unfortunately, Internal Affairs suspects him of wrongdoing, and unless he vindicates himself, Frazier may never make Detective First Grade. He gets the chance to show off his expertise when his captain assigns him to negotiate with Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) who has organized what appears to be a major bank robbery.  After storming the bank and disabling the security cameras, Russell and his confederates take a large number of hostages.  If Detective Frazier can bring this standoff to a successful conclusion, it could provide his career with a needed boost.  However, there are several complicating factors that make the situation extremely volatile.The head of the bank, Arthur Case, portrayed with suave malevolence by Christopher Plummer, is very worried about something that he has stored in one of the safe deposit boxes, and he hires Madeline White (Jodi Foster) to protect his interests. In addition, Dalton Russell's unpredictable behavior stymies Frazier, who is not quite sure what the man is really after.  Everyone in the film appears to have his or her own secret agenda, and the viewer is too often left in the dark.""Inside Man"" is a flashy film with many weird camera angles, loud, jarring music, and a headache-inducing script by Russell Gewirtz.  Denzel Washington is effective as a savvy and courageous hostage negotiator who senses that this is no ordinary heist.  Jodi Foster has very little to do as an icy and smug woman with important contacts and a shadowy vocation that is never fully explained.  Dalton Russell is also a cipher; his motives remain a mystery until very late in the film.  Willen Dafoe is underutilized as Captain John Darius, a cop who is anxious to storm the bank with his SWAT team.The main problem with ""Inside Man"" is that the characters, with the exception of Detective Frazier, are remote and one-dimensional.  Even the most clever film needs to engage the viewer emotionally at some level if it is to succeed.  ""Inside Man"" is a puzzle that one wants to solve, but once you leave the theater and try to figure out what you just saw, you will soon forget about it.

1002978,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000GFLKEY,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","It's good to see filmmaker Spike Lee come back to form with this highly entertaining popcorn movie that transcends the tense hostage crisis portrayed with a clever plot of psychological gamesmanship and duplicity. At first, the film feels like it's going to be a new millennium update of Sidney Lumet's 1975 classic, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", complete with Terence Blanchard's jazzy, 1970's-sounding score. Lee, however, spices the story with his own sensibilities around urban survival and post-9/11 racial tensions, and the movie benefits greatly from the perspective of a director not known for such predictable genre pictures. While it runs a bit long at 129 minutes, there is so much zigzag to the proceedings that the length is forgivable.Impressively written by first-time screenwriter Russell Gewirtz, the plot meticulously unfolds on a precise, need-to-know basis as it focuses on the mano-a-mano game between coolly confident criminal Dalton Russell and cynical NYPD detective Keith Frazier after Russell and his crew hold up a Lower Manhattan bank and keep fifty hostages at gunpoint. This is no standard good-versus-evil melodrama, as Gewirtz and Lee give both characters a lot of intriguing texture which make them fascinating adversaries in an unlikely search for a common bond.  Audaciously, Lee chooses not to spotlight so much on the suspense elements of the tense situation at hand since the movie includes flash-forward interviews with freed hostages. Rather, the film is far more involved with the characters' motivations and what they are willing to do to move toward resolution.An additional wrinkle is the bank chairman Arthur Case, who is worried about securing the confidential contents of his safe-deposit box once the robbery is underway. At this point, he hires Madeline White, a coolly calculating, designer-outfitted power broker willing to negotiate with Russell to get the box. How all four characters dance around each other is the primary pleasure to be derived from the movie, as one keeps guessing what each will do to get to his or her objective. Moreover, Lee's trademark touches are everywhere from the unexpected sparks of comedy - some piercing in their political incorrectness but no less funny - to the artificial backward zooms that make characters look like they are on conveyor belts to the idiosyncratic behavior of the hostages.Casting is just about ideal here. It's no surprise that longtime Lee muse Denzel Washington is terrific as Frazier, showing the character's flaws, ambition and moxie with maximum fluency. Clive Owen has the most cryptic role as Russell, but he manages to exude supreme confidence and a conflicted conscience with minimal fuss. Leave it to Lee to capitalize on Jodie Foster's inherently chilly intellect and subvert it to make the patronizing White a curiously ambiguous and utterly fascinating figure. There is nice supporting work by Christopher Plummer expertly shifting between benign and treacherous as Case, Willem Dafoe surprisingly non-villainous as the head of the SWAT Team, and especially British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor a completely convincing New Yorker as Frazier's enthusiastic partner. There is a nice twist at the end, but Gewirtz's script makes it satisfying within the context of the entire plot. This is a deft, character-driven thriller most welcome during the typical late winter/early spring movie-going doldrums.",4,"Spike, a Sharp Cast and a Crafty Script Bring Dimension to Tense Hostage Drama",1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,3405,"['good', 'see', 'filmmaker', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'come', 'back', 'form', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'tense', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'portrayed', 'clever', 'plot', 'psychological', 'gamesmanship', 'duplicity', 'first', 'film', 'feels', 'going', 'be', 'new', 'millennium', 'update', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', '1975', 'classic', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'complete', 'Terence', 'Blanchard', 'jazzy', ""1970's-sounding"", 'score', 'Lee', 'however', 'story', 'own', 'sensibilities', 'urban', 'survival', 'post-9/11', 'racial', 'tensions', 'movie', 'benefits', 'greatly', 'perspective', 'director', 'not', 'known', 'such', 'predictable', 'genre', 'pictures', 'bit', 'long', '129', 'minutes', 'so', 'much', 'zigzag', 'proceedings', 'length', 'forgivable.Impressively', 'written', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'plot', 'meticulously', 'precise', 'need-to-know', 'basis', 'mano-a-mano', 'game', 'coolly', 'confident', 'criminal', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'cynical', 'NYPD', 'detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'Russell', 'crew', 'hold', 'up', 'Lower', 'Manhattan', 'bank', 'keep', 'fifty', 'hostages', 'gunpoint', 'standard', 'good-versus-evil', 'melodrama', 'Gewirtz', 'Lee', 'give', 'characters', 'lot', 'intriguing', 'texture', 'make', 'fascinating', 'adversaries', 'unlikely', 'search', 'common', 'bond', 'Audaciously', 'Lee', 'not', 'spotlight', 'so', 'much', 'suspense', 'elements', 'tense', 'situation', 'hand', 'movie', 'flash-forward', 'interviews', 'freed', 'hostages', 'Rather', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'involved', 'characters', 'motivations', 'what', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'move', 'resolution.An', 'additional', 'wrinkle', 'bank', 'chairman', 'Arthur', 'Case', 'who', 'worried', 'securing', 'confidential', 'contents', 'safe-deposit', 'box', 'robbery', 'underway', 'point', 'Madeline', 'White', 'coolly', 'calculating', 'designer-outfitted', 'power', 'broker', 'willing', 'negotiate', 'Russell', 'get', 'box', 'How', 'four', 'characters', 'dance', 'other', 'primary', 'pleasure', 'be', 'derived', 'movie', 'one', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'get', 'objective', 'Moreover', 'Lee', 'trademark', 'touches', 'are', 'everywhere', 'unexpected', 'sparks', 'comedy', 'piercing', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'less', 'funny', 'artificial', 'backward', 'zooms', 'make', 'characters', 'look', 'are', 'conveyor', 'belts', 'idiosyncratic', 'behavior', 'hostages.Casting', 'just', 'about', 'ideal', 'here', 'surprise', 'longtime', 'Lee', 'muse', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'terrific', 'Frazier', 'showing', 'character', 'flaws', 'ambition', 'moxie', 'maximum', 'fluency', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'most', 'cryptic', 'role', 'Russell', 'exude', 'supreme', 'confidence', 'conflicted', 'conscience', 'minimal', 'fuss', 'Leave', 'Lee', 'capitalize', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'inherently', 'chilly', 'intellect', 'subvert', 'make', 'patronizing', 'White', 'curiously', 'ambiguous', 'utterly', 'fascinating', 'figure', 'nice', 'supporting', 'work', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'expertly', 'shifting', 'benign', 'treacherous', 'Case', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'surprisingly', 'non-villainous', 'head', 'SWAT', 'Team', 'especially', 'British', 'actor', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'completely', 'convincing', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Frazier', 'enthusiastic', 'partner', 'nice', 'twist', 'end', 'Gewirtz', 'script', 'satisfying', 'context', 'entire', 'plot', 'deft', 'character-driven', 'thriller', 'most', 'welcome', 'typical', 'late', 'winter/early', 'spring', 'movie-going', 'doldrums']",N/A

1002980,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000GFLKEY,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","The really good thing about Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" is the ensemble of brilliant actors. Denzel Washington is a detective who has an odd choice of fashion and an issue with marriage. Clive Owen is the head of a team of robbers who has something else in mind other than money. Jodie Foster is an antagonistic broker who can easily talk down her victims. Christopher Plummer is the Chairman of the Board of Directors who is willing to keep a secret that's hidden in his own bank. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Denzel's partner in crime who is always willing to be a part of the action. These and many other actors give spectacular performances.But as the film features a great ensemble of actors, the film itself fails to impress. Aside from the shockingly powerful conflicts involving racism and corruption, the plot involving the heist and the overthrow of a government official is something that's already been seen before. If you've seen ""Dog Day Afternoon"" or have read Nelson DeMille's ""Cathedral,"" then you'll notice that the story in ""Inside Man"" is nothing really special. Another problem with this film is the uneven third act. With all the hell that's been going on in the last two acts, this final segment contains a much slower pace, which really becomes very tiresome when the last few minutes of the film finally approaches. And speaking of the ending, the last fifteen minutes features two twist endings. But somehow they weren't very shocking. I said to myself, ""that was unexpected,"" but at the same time I said, ""but why don't I feel as shocked as I'm supposed to be?"" I guess I've seen too many twist endings in recent movies that are kind of like these two, and maybe that's why I'm not surprised at all. But I do believe that the biggest problem with this film is that the jumpy timeline. Once we're in the middle of the bank heist, we start to see some brief scenes that are set in an interrogation room (I won't spoil it for you by telling you exactly which people are inside it). This really spoils the tension and the atmosphere as we already seem to know how this will all end.Don't get me wrong. Spike Lee is an intelligent director, and all of the actors give great performances that no doubt stick out in this movie. However, the script and the overall climax and resolution don't really work. I still prefer the film ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (bank heist) and the novel ""Cathedral"" (political corruption and hostage situation).",3,Incredible director and actors; the rest of the film . . . meh,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,2441,"['really', 'good', 'thing', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Inside', 'Man', 'ensemble', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'detective', 'who', 'odd', 'choice', 'fashion', 'issue', 'marriage', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'head', 'team', 'robbers', 'who', 'something', 'else', 'mind', 'other', 'money', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'antagonistic', 'broker', 'who', 'can', 'easily', 'talk', 'down', 'victims', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Chairman', 'Board', 'Directors', 'who', 'willing', 'keep', 'secret', 'hidden', 'own', 'bank', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Denzel', 'partner', 'crime', 'who', 'always', 'willing', 'be', 'part', 'action', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'give', 'spectacular', 'performances.But', 'film', 'great', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'film', 'impress', 'Aside', 'shockingly', 'powerful', 'conflicts', 'involving', 'racism', 'corruption', 'plot', 'involving', 'heist', 'overthrow', 'government', 'official', 'something', 'already', 'been', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'have', 'read', 'Nelson', 'DeMille', 'Cathedral', 'then', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'story', 'Inside', 'Man', 'nothing', 'really', 'special', 'problem', 'film', 'uneven', 'third', 'act', 'hell', 'been', 'going', 'last', 'two', 'acts', 'final', 'segment', 'much', 'slower', 'pace', 'really', 'very', 'tiresome', 'when', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'finally', 'speaking', 'ending', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'features', 'two', 'twist', 'endings', 'somehow', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'shocking', 'said', 'myself', 'was', 'unexpected', 'same', 'time', 'said', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'shocked', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'be', 'guess', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'twist', 'endings', 'recent', 'movies', 'are', 'kind', 'two', 'maybe', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'do', 'believe', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'jumpy', 'timeline', ""'re"", 'middle', 'bank', 'heist', 'start', 'see', 'brief', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'interrogation', 'room', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling', 'exactly', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'tension', 'atmosphere', 'already', 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'intelligent', 'director', 'actors', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'doubt', 'stick', 'out', 'movie', 'However', 'script', 'overall', 'climax', 'resolution', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'still', 'prefer', 'film', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'bank', 'heist', 'novel', 'Cathedral', 'political', 'corruption', 'hostage', 'situation']",N/A
1002981,A3LGR1ME0F03FR,B000GFLKEY,Eugene Fenlon  BA,"[1, 4]","'Inside Man' is the story of a NYPD Detective named Keith Frazier (played by Denzel Washington), struggles to outsmart a clever bank robber (Clive Owen) who, along with a well-trained strategic crew of accomplices, has seized control of a Wall Street bank, turning what initially looks like a hostage crisis into a personal crusade to expose a mysterious secret.As the dangerous game continues, a power broker called Madaline White (Jodie Foster) injects more problem solving into an already crucial and dangerous situation.With an impressive cast that also includes Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe, 'Inside Man' is a pretty solid, entertaining and engaging film. However, it all seems as if it could have been done better. Thrilling and tense scenes that are supposed to be ""thrilling and tense"", are not. The story seems to travel in one constant and slightly boring pace, while performances are just pale. The acting in 'Inside Man' is a surprise, as for its impressive cast of professional actors are, in a way, unprofessional. For example: Denzel Washington (to no surprise) plays himself as he does in every other film he has been in, Clive Owen (to no surprise again) acts as if he is reading directly from the script in his usual constant boredom tone that drags on throughout the entire film, plus Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe's easily forgettable performances.The acting IS bad in this film, but not terrible. From Clive Owen's minimal effort to act, to Denzel Washington's annoying outburts of laughter and attempts at black humor is quite possibly the worst of the acting in 'Inside Man'. The cast do in a way let this film down. Especially the unwatchable scenes were Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) talks to his unbelieveably slutty and cheezy wife/object, who is always situated on the bed in a glossy pink nighty.With an intelligent and new twist on the 'bank robbery' genre, 'Inside Man' does at times surprise and outsmart the viewer. Clive Owen's character pulls off a very cool and dangerously clever bank robbery that successfully fools the entire NYPD.

I will just add that the early sequences are nicely filmed and the story is immediately engaging.Denzel plays an aging detective who has little in the way of heroics in his repertoire.  He's a bad dresser, laughs too loud, but brings some intelligence to the job.  Nevertheless, one wonders what the sex-kitten girlfriend sees in him. Jodi Foster plays a villain, and she does a great job of being truly unlikeable.I've never been a fan of Clive Owen, and he does little to change my mind here.  His character -- the lead bankrobber -- does a lot of posturing and swearing and does a good job of intimidating his hostages, but it's a bit hard to see what part of that character would care to shame an exNazi [the reason for the heist at that PARTICULAR bank]. Willem DaFoe is credible as a cop, but not much is asked of him here.  Christopher Plummer seems not sufficiently old enough to have made a lot of money during WWII and still be as young as he seems at the time of the robbery.There are references to Dog Day Afternoon (1975), another heist-turned-hostage-crisis film based on a real event.

1002985,AY12DBB0U420B,B000GFLKEY,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was the ""Inside Man"" DVD starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster and directed by Spike Lee. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was billed on the DVD cover as ""A heist thriller like you've never seen."" Well, there's a certain truth in that statement. The movie depicted a small, but very well-equipped group of men who invaded a bank and quickly took over and locked everybody in. There might nave been 40 or 50 employees and customers in the bank and they became instant hostages. Of course, the NYC police, with Denzel Washington in the lead role, responded quickly and moved a small army around the bank. Of course, there were  thousands of spectators and the area was crawling with news media people. Then the negotiations began. Of course, the gang wanted a whole list of things including an airplane to carry them away. Nothing seemed to work out and there was a threat to get this thing going or two dead hostages would be thrown out every hour. At this point the movie seemed like a somewhat more serious replay of ""Dog Day Afternoon.""But wait! A secondary plot was slowly developing in negotiations between the bank president, the Mayor of NYC and Jody Foster. It seemed that the whole bank robbery thing wasn't a robbery at all. No money was taken. No one was killed. A few people were roughed up. That was it. It was the bank president's way of retrieving an incriminating document from his own safe deposit box, the only one that was touched. It seemed that the document indicated that the bank president had dealt with the defeated German government during the ending days of WWII in order to get the money to establish the bank in the first place.Well, the whole movie just seemed to fitter away into nothingness. It had a real promising beginning, tapered off in the middle and then just went into this surrealistic Hollywood plot in the end and turned into a real flop, in my opinion. It became very disappointing as the movie progressed and the movie itself seemed to become longer and longer. I guess you might say that it was a high action movie in which the brakes had been applied and it ground to a boring ending. Too bad. The acting was good. The cinema and production values were excellent.Gary Peterson",3,"Promising Beginning, Tapered Off In Middle, Surrealistic  Ending.",1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2289,"['Last', 'night', 'bargain-rack', 'movie', 'was', 'Inside', 'Man', 'DVD', 'starring', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'found', 'five-dollar', 'bin', 'Wal-Mart', 'was', 'billed', 'DVD', 'cover', 'A', 'heist', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Well', 'certain', 'truth', 'statement', 'movie', 'depicted', 'small', 'very', 'well-equipped', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'invaded', 'bank', 'quickly', 'took', 'over', 'locked', 'everybody', 'might', 'nave', 'been', '40', '50', 'employees', 'customers', 'bank', 'became', 'instant', 'hostages', 'course', 'NYC', 'police', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'lead', 'role', 'responded', 'quickly', 'moved', 'small', 'army', 'bank', 'course', 'were', 'thousands', 'spectators', 'area', 'was', 'crawling', 'news', 'media', 'people', 'Then', 'negotiations', 'began', 'course', 'gang', 'wanted', 'whole', 'list', 'things', 'including', 'airplane', 'carry', 'away', 'Nothing', 'seemed', 'work', 'out', 'there', 'was', 'threat', 'get', 'thing', 'going', 'two', 'dead', 'hostages', 'would', 'be', 'thrown', 'out', 'hour', 'point', 'movie', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'more', 'serious', 'replay', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'wait', 'secondary', 'plot', 'was', 'slowly', 'developing', 'negotiations', 'bank', 'president', 'Mayor', 'NYC', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'seemed', 'whole', 'bank', 'robbery', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'robbery', 'money', 'was', 'taken', 'one', 'was', 'killed', 'few', 'people', 'were', 'roughed', 'up', 'was', 'was', 'bank', 'president', 'way', 'retrieving', 'incriminating', 'document', 'own', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'touched', 'seemed', 'document', 'indicated', 'bank', 'president', 'had', 'dealt', 'defeated', 'German', 'government', 'ending', 'days', 'WWII', 'order', 'get', 'money', 'establish', 'bank', 'first', 'place.Well', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'fitter', 'away', 'nothingness', 'had', 'real', 'promising', 'beginning', 'tapered', 'off', 'middle', 'then', 'just', 'went', 'surrealistic', 'Hollywood', 'plot', 'end', 'turned', 'real', 'flop', 'opinion', 'became', 'very', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'progressed', 'movie', 'seemed', 'become', 'longer', 'longer', 'guess', 'might', 'say', 'was', 'high', 'action', 'movie', 'brakes', 'had', 'been', 'applied', 'ground', 'boring', 'ending', 'Too', 'bad', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'cinema', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'excellent.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

The story is a variation of hundreds of other films (writer Russell Gewirtz somehow got away with just an outline of a script of holes) and the technique of telling the story - interspersing post incident interviews with the people involved in the caper - makes it thud along.Denzel Washington is his usual fine acting self, playing a cop with his own demons. Chiwetel Ejiofor is solid as his partner. Clive Owen spends the better part of the film behind a mask but continues his reputation for quiet and powerful characterizations as the bank robber. Christopher Plummer is convincing as the back president with secrets to hide, which Jodie Foster as a middle-woman manages to manipulate. Willem Defoe is fine as the cop in charge. They all perform well in roles they could do in their sleep.Clocking in at over two hours the film seems to dawdle over some inconsequential details in an attempt to camouflage the holes in the script. Spike Lee makes it work because of his style. But in the end the story isn't involving enough to hold our attention ('been there, done that') and this viewer, for one, fell asleep during portions when the film slowed for unknown reasons.

1002989,A5SC9O8TZJ6DK,B000GFLKEY,Gregory William Locke,"[0, 1]","Inside Man features an incredible cast, a great - but not perfect - crime thriller script, amazing cinematography and a World Class director named Spike Lee. On paper it's a great film. If you see clips of some of the should-be classic scenes, you'd think this was one for the ages. It's not. There are just too many problems. Problems, sadly, that could've easily been avoided.That said, Inside Man is a pretty good film. Not the classic it should've been, but a solid film that appeals to both the cinephile set and the everyday popcorn movie goer. Lee, who didn't write the script and only casually adds his signature fingerprints, here comes off as a real moviemaker, Inside Man maybe being the movie we'll look back on as proof of his ability. Where fellow auteur types of his generation such as Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino seem unable to make anything other than signature films, Lee has done much for his legacy by proving that he can skillfully - and successfully - make someone else's movie.And damn if Inside Man - which stars heavyweights Denzel Washington and Clive Owen (as well as a great supporting cast and the unnecessary presence of Jodie Foster) - isn't the by-far most commercially successful film of Lee's career, bringing in almost $200 million at theaters worldwide. To put that into perspective, Lee's films average $20 million. The concept of an auteur stepping away from his usual style to make a Hollywood picture, and then that film making 10 times more than the average of his other films, would be a great topic for a paper. Hell, it'd be a great idea for a topics course at a film school. I'd say that it's a shame, but, for what it is (an instantly entertaining bid dollar film whose only real creative touch is a small storytelling device), it's about as good as they come.Now, how about those above mentioned problems. The usage of music, for starters, is embarrassingly unfitting and bad. Just plain bad taste. Also, Denzel's lead is a bit too clich&eacute;d of a character. They made lots of good movies anchored by characters so obvious in 40s, 50s and 60s, but not much since. Needless to say, Denzel's Detective Keith Frazier is a snore despite the actor's every effort to bring him to life. Another major problem is the Jodie Foster character, who is just downright out of place and almost unnecessary. We know why she's there, and it makes sense, but I get the feeling that some of the scenes that would've held her storyline together were cut or written out. Her presence will likely leave you scratching your head. And last but not least we have that story telling device we mentioned above, which is best described as a ""In Medias Res"" style, with Owen's character teasing us from the first frame and interrogation scenes edited here and there. It's not a bad device ... it just doesn't work nearly as well as the writer, director, producers and cast probably thought it would when they were in production. Sometimes that happens in movies. Often, especially when you attempt something as ambitious as In Medias Res.Inside Man does succeed, however, thanks to how well its made (especially the non linear editing, which is almost next-to-none), how nicely Lee injects style points here and there, and how downright memorable and well executed a handful of scenes are. But what, you ask, is the movie really about? Well, it's a heist movie. It's about some people robbing a bank and a very paranoid man who really doesn't want something he has stored in a safe deposit box to be uncovered. It's about a detective's last case before retiring and it's about a brilliant criminal. I don't want to say too much more, due to how the story is told and how easy it can be to kill the fun of a heist film by trying to describe the action. To me, Inside Man is about its director.

1002991,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000GFLKEY,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 4]","Renegade director Spike Lee and actor Denzel Washington (MO' BETTER BLUES, MALCOLM X, HE GOT GAME) team up for the fourth time in this absorbing and byzantine caper film. Denzel plays Police Detective Keith Frazier, toiling in the Hostage Negotiation Team, who, along with his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), gets assigned to a daytime robbery at the Manhattan Trust Bank which had escalated into a hostage situation. But, with a cerebral criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who seems to have thought of every contingency and is always one step ahead of the law and, also, with the involvement of a mysterious female civilian negotiatior (Jodie Foster), things get very murky indeed.As usual with these types of films, there are layers of complexity woven into the plot. Nagging questions surface thru the course of the film which perplex the viewer. Why does the leader of the robber gang seem to be stalling? Why is the elderly chairman of the bank's Board of Director (Christopher Plummer) so invested in the goings-on? What exactly is Jodie Foster's character up to? Why do the robbers dig a hole in the storeroom? And, because this is a Spike Lee joint, there are several scene interjections of social and racial relevance. Let's face it, we're living in the post 9/11 era and Lee's sequence of the ""Arab's"" treatment by the police, in particular, underscores that plainly.The magnetic Denzel Washington is again superb (but, really, when does the guy ever suck?). He always brings to his role an aura of cool assuredness and a certain stylish bravura. His smile, as usual, when directed at potential perpetrators, contains a biting intensity. Clive Owen is equally very good as the self-contained and calculated villain of the story, somehow becoming sympathetic enough that you sort of root for him. His opening lines, as he breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the viewer, makes him an instantly intriguing figure. Jodie Foster doesn't do as well in her nebulous role of a smirky, high-powered transactionist but she does do enough, acting-wise, to rouse the audience's curiousity. I do feel, however, that Chiwetel Ejiofor's talent is wasted here as he isn't given enough script with which to get his hands dirty.INSIDE MAN isn't exactly set at a breaknecked pace. It's a contemplative feature film, a thinking man's thriller with very few action set pieces, though tension is maintained and remains palpable throughout. The movie's main selling point is the cast, who makes the most out of this twisty caper premise. This complement of actors has got to be Spike Lee's most star powered group yet. Now, the ending might leave a few audiences disgruntled for not having enough ""punch"" but it's perfectly in line with the cerebral tone of the movie.INSIDE MAN proves the versatility of Spike Lee as a director as, this time out, he tackles a suspense film and does a more than adequate job. Once again, Spike ventures into slice-of-life, character-driven interplays, even giving his lesser actors time to briefly shine in the spotlight. There is one sequence - wherein the sergeant first on the crime scene reveals his casual racial prejudices to Detective Frazier - that I thought particularly effective. One of my favorite moments in the film is the scene wherein the police, after having solved a puzzle postured by the heist ringleader, continue to humorously argue about the details of the puzzle. And, then there's the prim-looking white guy whose cell's ring tone is Kanye West's ""Golddigger."" Anyway, if you don't mind sitting thru a film over two hours long - a film which, by the way, might require more than one viewing - and consulting your brain cells throughout its screening, then INSIDE MAN is for you.

1002999,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000GFLKEY,Jean E. Pouliot,"[2, 2]","""Inside Man"" unfolds its characters and plot in seeming slow-motion -- perhaps a bit like a real-life hostage drama. The film's plot advances by millimeters, in a seemingly unknowable direction. Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings.A well-planned hostage situation develops at a New York City bank. Dozens of hostages are taken, and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence. Keith Frazier, an NYPD detective and hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington, is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis. But this is no ordinary hostage situation, as the hostage-takers aren't playing by the normal rules. What are they after? Why are they stalling for time?The bank's philanthropist owner (Christopher Plummer) has taken an unusual interest in the situation. When he contacts a high society fixer (Jodi Foster) to retrieve property from the besieged bank, it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank. Foster, Washington and the lead hostage taker (played with intelligence and canny reserve by Clive Owen) soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity.Spike Lee's cinematography is terrific.

I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot.Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a ""s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them because they were disguised as painters.Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues.

From the moment it begins, there is clearly an urban vibe; the shots of Manhattan, not to mention the movie being billed as ""A Spike Lee joint"" give it a grittier tone. Do not let these minor touches fool you; as the movie progresses, it helps to not go in with preconceived notions of the typical Spike Lee movie. The camera shot changes every five seconds. Normally this would just annoy me, but the editor managed to do this without wasting a single one of those five second shots, and with great accompanying music it was actually one of my favorite opening sequences ever.Clive Owen is great as, a ""not your everyday bank robber,"" he's becoming one of my favorite actors. Denzel Washington played the lead role of the perceptive (if slightly jaded) police-detective. He gives us an incredibly performance in spite of the fact that he's playing a cop for what seams like the 11th time in his past 12 films. It's an interesting story with some decent twists and better than average dialogue. Jodie Foster is disappointingly underused as Madeline, so to with Christopher Plummer as Arthur. Willem Dafoe flounders in the background, it looks like he doesn't know why he's there. Chiwetel Ejiofor delivers one of the better performances, yet not his best from his other recent film. The dialogue in the movie is good. There's some humorous and great lines that come out of the character's mouths.What I liked about Inside Man was the style it was made. It is choppy, but not so much, you get a sense of tension, and it seems very high paced. The plot is good, and very intriguing. There are some things you have to figure out throughout the film, which makes it more interesting. My only problem was that after the bank robbery was over, the film continued for another half hour, and it started to drag a bit.Aside from minor problems it's a safe bet if you want an enjoyable film and one of Spike Lee's finest.",4,[3.5]--Solid heist thriller that puts a new spin on the familiar tale.,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2021,"['Inside', 'Man', 'good', 'film', 'essentially', 'standard', 'hostage', 'situation', 'thriller', 'was', ""n't"", 'top', 'moment', 'clearly', 'urban', 'vibe', 'shots', 'Manhattan', 'not', 'mention', 'movie', 'being', 'billed', 'A', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'joint', 'give', 'grittier', 'tone', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'minor', 'touches', 'fool', 'movie', 'not', 'go', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'typical', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'camera', 'shot', 'changes', 'five', 'seconds', 'Normally', 'would', 'just', 'annoy', 'editor', 'managed', 'do', 'wasting', 'single', 'one', 'five', 'second', 'shots', 'great', 'accompanying', 'music', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'favorite', 'opening', 'sequences', 'ever.Clive', 'Owen', 'great', 'not', 'everyday', 'bank', 'robber', 'becoming', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'perceptive', 'slightly', 'jaded', 'police-detective', 'incredibly', 'performance', 'spite', 'fact', 'playing', 'cop', 'what', 'seams', '11th', 'time', 'past', '12', 'films', 'interesting', 'story', 'decent', 'twists', 'better', 'average', 'dialogue', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'disappointingly', 'underused', 'Madeline', 'so', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Arthur', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'flounders', 'background', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'there', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'yet', 'not', 'best', 'other', 'recent', 'film', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'good', 'humorous', 'great', 'lines', 'come', 'character', 'mouths.What', 'liked', 'Inside', 'Man', 'was', 'style', 'was', 'made', 'choppy', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'get', 'sense', 'tension', 'very', 'high', 'paced', 'plot', 'good', 'very', 'intriguing', 'are', 'things', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'bank', 'robbery', 'was', 'over', 'film', 'continued', 'half', 'hour', 'started', 'drag', 'bit.Aside', 'minor', 'problems', 'safe', 'bet', 'want', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'one', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'finest']",N/A

Most of them just don't have what it takes to keep my eyes on the screen with the movie, instead of the screen on my computer or the book in my lap. ""Inside Man"", I am happy to say, kept my attention throughout its running time - and then for a while after as I picked the story apart.From almost the outset, it feels heavily influenced by ""The Usual Suspects"".All the performances are excellent, the direction - with one notable exception - is solid and the script relentlessly forward. The Jodie Foster character, however,is unbelievable. It feels like the original idea for the character was altered in the course of making the movie to serve as sort of a Greek chorus whenever Spike Lee ran into a problem telling the story.The movie is heavily dependent on cinematic tricks, such as exaggerated split focus. (There's a name for the effect, which I can't remember.) Surprisingly it is clumsily used, especially in a scene with Denzel Washington.The basic story is simple: we are introduced to the bad guy, played by Clive Owen, who promises us that he is going yo pull off the perfect bank robbery. Lee employs flashforwards and flashbacks and real time to tell the story.It is a taut and suspenseful storytelling - a very satisfying movie viewing experience.The problem, at least for me, is that afterward I recognized that the story is full of holes. To Spike Lee's credit, like a magician, he keeps things moving so fast you don't latch on to the gaps while watching the movie. But afterwards, the holes were apparent.Overall, though, the after-experience doesn't detract from the fact that this is an excellent piece of movie making.Jerry",5,"Set-piece bank heist film keeps your attention, but afterward . . .",1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1704,"[""'ve"", 'grown', 'increasingly', 'impatient', 'watching', 'recent', 'movies', 'Most', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'keep', 'eyes', 'screen', 'movie', 'instead', 'screen', 'computer', 'book', 'lap', 'Man', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'kept', 'attention', 'running', 'time', 'then', 'while', 'picked', 'story', 'almost', 'outset', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'direction', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'solid', 'script', 'relentlessly', 'forward', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'character', 'however', 'unbelievable', 'original', 'idea', 'character', 'was', 'altered', 'course', 'making', 'movie', 'serve', 'sort', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'whenever', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'ran', 'problem', 'telling', 'story.The', 'movie', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'cinematic', 'tricks', 'such', 'exaggerated', 'split', 'focus', 'name', 'effect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'clumsily', 'used', 'especially', 'scene', 'Denzel', 'Washington.The', 'basic', 'story', 'simple', 'are', 'introduced', 'bad', 'guy', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'going', 'yo', 'pull', 'off', 'perfect', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Lee', 'flashforwards', 'flashbacks', 'real', 'time', 'tell', 'story.It', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'storytelling', 'very', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'viewing', 'experience.The', 'problem', 'least', 'afterward', 'recognized', 'story', 'full', 'holes', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'credit', 'magician', 'things', 'moving', 'so', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'latch', 'gaps', 'watching', 'movie', 'afterwards', 'holes', 'were', 'apparent.Overall', 'though', 'after-experience', ""n't"", 'detract', 'fact', 'excellent', 'piece', 'movie', 'making.Jerry']",N/A

She knows it must be something either valuable or something he just wants knew one to find out about. So she's really good as women that people go to get things done and she's also always makes it clear that she's nobodys fool.While William Dafoe (Spiderman) is also in good form as a cop who's ready to take command of the situation if Washington messes up.

1003013,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000GFLKEY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Remember when Woody Allen released Match Point last year and instantly revamped his career, probably because the whole tone of the film had changed from his previous efforts. Here Spike Lee basically does that; He's not revamping his career, because it's been fine...But this movie has a whole different tone from Lee's previous films. And that's a good thing, because this is a very smart film that throws constant plot twists while always staying true to what's going on. Bank robbing movies are hard to do now a days. Not movies about bank robbers who rob banks occasionally in the movie (Bandits); I'm talking full-on entire movie in the bank, bank robbing movies. Back in the 70's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" pretty much wrote the book on those kinds of movies and how they should be; I don't think that films been topped. But this film (which also does something out of the ordinary in referencing bank robbing movies such as the aformentioned one) does something different with the bank robbery genre. The movie opens like the Johnny Depp film The Libertine did. A character, in this case Dalton Russel (Clive Owen), stares directly into the camera and explains that he's going to rob a bank for two reasons. One, because of the financial aspect and two, because he can. In the next few moments we watch a team of bank robbers, wearing masks and disguised as painters, storm into a bank in New York and commence the robbery. As soon as the cops get wind of it, it turns into Dog Day Afternoon outside the banks sans the media and screaming fans. Leading the pack of hostage negotiators is Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), a smart detective who see's something isn't quite right with the robbery. Christopher Plummer co-stars as the CEO of the bank Arthur Case, who's hiding something in one of the safety desposit boxes; Jodie Foster co-stars as Madeleine, the woman hired by Case to keep the contents of the safety desposit box secret; And Willem Dafoe stars as Captain John Darius, another cop involved in the hostage situation. The ending is really smartly done and believable in the context of the film. This is entertaining, smart, and very good.GRADE: A-",5,A New Kind of Bank Robbing Movie,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,2171,"['Remember', 'when', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'released', 'Match', 'Point', 'last', 'year', 'instantly', 'revamped', 'career', 'probably', 'whole', 'tone', 'film', 'had', 'changed', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Here', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'basically', 'not', 'revamping', 'career', 'been', 'fine', 'movie', 'whole', 'different', 'tone', 'Lee', 'previous', 'films', 'good', 'thing', 'very', 'smart', 'film', 'constant', 'plot', 'twists', 'always', 'staying', 'true', 'what', 'going', 'Bank', 'robbing', 'movies', 'are', 'hard', 'do', 'now', 'days', 'Not', 'movies', 'bank', 'robbers', 'who', 'rob', 'banks', 'occasionally', 'movie', 'Bandits', ""'m"", 'talking', 'full-on', 'entire', 'movie', 'bank', 'bank', 'robbing', 'movies', 'Back', '70', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'pretty', 'much', 'wrote', 'book', 'kinds', 'movies', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'films', 'been', 'topped', 'film', 'also', 'something', 'ordinary', 'referencing', 'bank', 'robbing', 'movies', 'such', 'aformentioned', 'one', 'something', 'different', 'bank', 'robbery', 'genre', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'film', 'Libertine', 'did', 'character', 'case', 'Dalton', 'Russel', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'directly', 'camera', 'going', 'rob', 'bank', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'financial', 'aspect', 'two', 'can', 'next', 'few', 'moments', 'watch', 'team', 'bank', 'robbers', 'wearing', 'masks', 'disguised', 'painters', 'storm', 'bank', 'New', 'York', 'commence', 'robbery', 'As', 'soon', 'cops', 'get', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'banks', 'sans', 'media', 'screaming', 'fans', 'Leading', 'pack', 'hostage', 'negotiators', 'Detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'smart', 'detective', 'who', 'see', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'robbery', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'co-stars', 'CEO', 'bank', 'Arthur', 'Case', 'who', 'hiding', 'something', 'one', 'safety', 'desposit', 'boxes', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'co-stars', 'Madeleine', 'woman', 'hired', 'Case', 'keep', 'contents', 'safety', 'desposit', 'box', 'secret', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Captain', 'John', 'Darius', 'cop', 'involved', 'hostage', 'situation', 'ending', 'really', 'smartly', 'done', 'believable', 'context', 'film', 'entertaining', 'smart', 'very', 'good.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Directed by Spike Lee, in what would seem like a string of films designed to tug at your intelligent side, yet fill your craving for action, Inside Man manages to deliver to the last drop, leaving you with Indian Bollywood music playing in your head. It retains all the elements of a solid caper film, basking in the smarts of the old police caper genre and leaves us with something greater than forced twists and clich? shoot-outs.The movie starts out with full confidence in holding the audience's attention. Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) begins by telling us he's devised the perfect bank robbery, and on an average post-9/11 New York afternoon he and his small team walk in to a branch and proceed to hold about 40 people hostage. Enter Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), who maps out the negotiation strategies. Both men are smart, naturally. Suspense, as we've come to expect, evolves from watching and wondering who's outguessing who.At the core of Inside Man is a sharp caper/thriller that's well-crafted by Lee and his group of collaborators, including actors Washington, Jodie Foster, Owen, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as well as screenwriter Russell Gewirtz in his ground-breaking debut. This thriller about the perfect bank robbery, wherein both the cops and the robbers are genuinely smart and motivated, yet not superhuman nor without humanity, gets as close to ""excellent"" as any similarly concerned Hollywood feature has come in the past decade or so. Inside Man will likely be remembered as one of those better films.Hardly anyone in Inside Man has to stretch much--and that's just fine. No one really has to since the parts are tailor made for them. Washington, a long-time Spike Lee favorite, fits right in as the streetwise cop, who doesn't necessarily play by the rules but gets the job done. He and Ejiofor have a nice, easy-going rapport as partners who've been together awhile. Owen plays another calm, collected, no-nonsense guy you empathize with, who can look straight into the camera and tell it like it is. You definitely want him to get away with it. Only Foster steers away a little from her usual intelligent heroines to play someone who is still smart but also very cunning--and a little mean-spirited. It looks like she had a lot of fun doing it, too, in her smart, three-piece suit and subtle smirks. In supporting roles, Dafoe does a nice turn as the befuddled S.W.A.T. leader, while Plummer, as a banker with a shady past, sort of plays the antithesis to his goody too-shoes Captain Von Trapp in Sound of Music.Inside Man, right up to its very title, is multi-layered on top of it's already many surfaced layers. It's sense of flawed people trying their hardest to do the right thing despite the wrongs they've committed (and may continue to commit) is rich for the very discussion that Lee is prone to provoke. As its post-robbery third act resolves to satisfy all the questions and plot strands for the audience, it raises further eyebrows in testing the ethical resilience of everyone's motives. What was it all for if not just for personal gain? The final scene where Washington stares down the past and his own future in his very hand is a brilliant summation on the lengths we can go to for personal happiness and success. We've come to expect such statements from Spike, but never before in such an entertaining fashion.credit for review is to t T squires, Couldn't put it better than himJubrilJubril.comBusiness Phenom",5,"Awesome Movie, Cast A+ Director A  Plot A+",1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,3622,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'fun', 'well-executed', 'entertaining', 'very', 'end', 'temporary', 'escape', 'then', 'Inside', 'Man', 'movie', 'Directed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'what', 'would', 'seem', 'string', 'films', 'designed', 'tug', 'intelligent', 'side', 'yet', 'fill', 'craving', 'action', 'Inside', 'Man', 'deliver', 'last', 'drop', 'leaving', 'Indian', 'Bollywood', 'music', 'playing', 'head', 'elements', 'solid', 'caper', 'film', 'basking', 'smarts', 'old', 'police', 'caper', 'genre', 'something', 'greater', 'forced', 'twists', 'clich', 'shoot-outs.The', 'movie', 'out', 'full', 'confidence', 'holding', 'audience', 'attention', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'telling', 'devised', 'perfect', 'bank', 'robbery', 'average', 'post-9/11', 'New', 'York', 'afternoon', 'small', 'team', 'walk', 'branch', 'proceed', 'hold', '40', 'people', 'hostage', 'Enter', 'Detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'out', 'negotiation', 'strategies', 'men', 'are', 'smart', 'naturally', 'Suspense', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'watching', 'wondering', 'who', 'outguessing', 'who.At', 'core', 'Inside', 'Man', 'sharp', 'caper/thriller', 'well-crafted', 'Lee', 'group', 'collaborators', 'including', 'actors', 'Washington', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Owen', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'as', 'well', 'screenwriter', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'ground-breaking', 'debut', 'thriller', 'perfect', 'bank', 'robbery', 'wherein', 'cops', 'robbers', 'are', 'genuinely', 'smart', 'motivated', 'yet', 'not', 'superhuman', 'humanity', 'as', 'close', 'excellent', 'similarly', 'concerned', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'come', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'Inside', 'Man', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'better', 'films.Hardly', 'anyone', 'Inside', 'Man', 'stretch', 'much', 'just', 'fine', 'one', 'really', 'parts', 'are', 'tailor', 'made', 'Washington', 'long-time', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'favorite', 'fits', 'right', 'streetwise', 'cop', 'who', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'play', 'rules', 'job', 'done', 'Ejiofor', 'have', 'nice', 'easy-going', 'rapport', 'partners', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'together', 'awhile', 'Owen', 'calm', 'collected', 'no-nonsense', 'guy', 'empathize', 'who', 'can', 'look', 'straight', 'camera', 'tell', 'definitely', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'Only', 'Foster', 'away', 'little', 'usual', 'intelligent', 'heroines', 'play', 'someone', 'who', 'still', 'smart', 'also', 'very', 'cunning', 'little', 'mean-spirited', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'doing', 'too', 'smart', 'three-piece', 'suit', 'subtle', 'smirks', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Dafoe', 'nice', 'turn', 'befuddled', 'S.W.A.T', 'leader', 'Plummer', 'banker', 'shady', 'past', 'sort', 'plays', 'antithesis', 'goody', 'too-shoes', 'Captain', 'Von', 'Trapp', 'Sound', 'Music.Inside', 'Man', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'title', 'multi-layered', 'top', 'already', 'many', 'surfaced', 'layers', 'sense', 'flawed', 'people', 'trying', 'hardest', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'wrongs', ""'ve"", 'committed', 'may', 'continue', 'commit', 'rich', 'very', 'discussion', 'Lee', 'prone', 'provoke', 'post-robbery', 'third', 'act', 'satisfy', 'questions', 'plot', 'strands', 'audience', 'further', 'eyebrows', 'testing', 'ethical', 'resilience', 'everyone', 'motives', 'What', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'personal', 'gain', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'Washington', 'down', 'past', 'own', 'future', 'very', 'hand', 'brilliant', 'summation', 'lengths', 'can', 'go', 'personal', 'happiness', 'success', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'such', 'statements', 'Spike', 'never', 'before', 'such', 'entertaining', 'fashion.credit', 'review', 't', 'T', 'squires', 'Could', ""n't"", 'put', 'better', 'himJubrilJubril.comBusiness', 'Phenom']",N/A

1003017,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000GFLKEY,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 7]","I have to start out by saying that as an avid movie watcher I generally try to keep an open mind when approaching a movie.  With that being said there are a couple of directors that I find this to be a particularly hard task to succeed in, Quentin Tarentino is one such director and the other is Spike Lee.  I have to say that whenever either of these two critically acclaimed directors releases a movie (or a `joint' as Spike Lee prefers to label them), I find it difficult to get too excited about seeing them, and sometimes I don't end up seeing the movie at all, though I try to make an effort because you never know when one might hit you just right.  So, when I saw the trailer for the upcoming Spike Lee movie ""Inside Man"" starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, I was somewhat interested in it simply because I enjoy both actors' work; however, Denzel had done a Spike Lee movie before that I didn't like, so that didn't guarantee that I would enjoy him in this one.  Over time I saw more trailers for the movie and read what the film was to be about and I have to say that for the first time ever, I was actually excited to see a Spike Lee movie, but whether my anticipation was misplaced or completely justified would remain to be seen.""Inside Man"" presents us with the story of a brilliant criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who has devised the perfect bank robbery and subsequent escape without being caught by the law.  However, when the plan is hatched events quickly begin to spiral out of control and the police are fast on the scene led by a cunningly smart detective (Denzel Washington) who will not rest until the situation is contained.  Just when negotiations are beginning to take shape between the criminals and the police, a government power broker (Jodie Foster) interferes throwing this delicate matter into a state of uncertainty where one wrong move could spell disaster for all involved.After watching this movie I quickly came to the conclusion that even though I generally dislike most Spike Lee movies, even he can surprise me sometimes.  ""Inside Man"" was a wonderfully constructed cat-and-mouse thriller that was completely engrossing and a genuine surprise to me, and was by far the most mainstream Spike Lee movie to date.  The story was well paced, full of twists-and-turns that you don't see coming, and the dialogue was so well-written and at times an absolute joy to listen to, especially the many exchanges between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's characters.  The acting was terrific from all actors involved, each actor was given so much to work with, which is often a rarity in an ensemble piece like this one, where there are so many A-list actors gathered in one film, generally one or two of them get shorted on development.  A lot of the fun I had in watching this movie was trying to figure out the various motives every character had or which side they were truly on, so many of the characters had hidden agendas you really didn't know what to expect from any of them, which made the experience all the more enjoyable for me.As I said earlier I'm not by any means a Spike Lee fan and enjoying this movie doesn't change that fact, but for me to have been even remotely entertained by this film is a feat in and of itself.  With all that being said, I think it would be nice to see more independent-type directors, such as Spike Lee or Quentin Tarentino, make more mainstream films and maybe, just maybe, I would like their work a whole lot more than simply one movie here and there.""Inside Man"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,Appearances Can Be Deceiving...,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,3583,"['have', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'avid', 'movie', 'watcher', 'generally', 'try', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'when', 'approaching', 'movie', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'couple', 'directors', 'find', 'be', 'particularly', 'hard', 'task', 'succeed', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'one', 'such', 'director', 'other', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'have', 'say', 'whenever', 'two', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'directors', 'movie', 'joint', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'prefers', 'label', 'find', 'difficult', 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'seeing', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'seeing', 'movie', 'try', 'make', 'effort', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'one', 'might', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'So', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'upcoming', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'Man', 'starring', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'was', 'somewhat', 'interested', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'actors', 'work', 'however', 'Denzel', 'had', 'done', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'would', 'enjoy', 'one', 'time', 'saw', 'more', 'trailers', 'movie', 'read', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'be', 'have', 'say', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'was', 'actually', 'excited', 'see', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'anticipation', 'was', 'misplaced', 'completely', 'justified', 'would', 'remain', 'be', 'seen', 'Man', 'story', 'brilliant', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'devised', 'perfect', 'bank', 'robbery', 'subsequent', 'escape', 'being', 'caught', 'law', 'However', 'when', 'plan', 'hatched', 'events', 'quickly', 'begin', 'spiral', 'control', 'police', 'are', 'fast', 'scene', 'led', 'cunningly', 'smart', 'detective', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'rest', 'situation', 'contained', 'Just', 'when', 'negotiations', 'are', 'beginning', 'take', 'shape', 'criminals', 'police', 'government', 'power', 'broker', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'throwing', 'delicate', 'matter', 'state', 'uncertainty', 'where', 'one', 'wrong', 'move', 'could', 'spell', 'disaster', 'involved.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'quickly', 'came', 'conclusion', 'even', 'generally', 'dislike', 'most', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movies', 'even', 'can', 'surprise', 'sometimes', 'Man', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'cat-and-mouse', 'thriller', 'was', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'genuine', 'surprise', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'mainstream', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'date', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'paced', 'full', 'twists-and-turns', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'dialogue', 'was', 'so', 'well-written', 'times', 'absolute', 'joy', 'listen', 'especially', 'many', 'exchanges', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'characters', 'acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'actors', 'involved', 'actor', 'was', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'often', 'rarity', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'one', 'where', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'A-list', 'actors', 'gathered', 'one', 'film', 'generally', 'one', 'two', 'get', 'shorted', 'development', 'lot', 'fun', 'had', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'various', 'motives', 'character', 'had', 'side', 'were', 'truly', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'had', 'hidden', 'agendas', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'made', 'experience', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'me.As', 'said', 'earlier', ""'m"", 'not', 'means', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'fan', 'enjoying', 'movie', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'remotely', 'entertained', 'film', 'feat', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'independent-type', 'directors', 'such', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'make', 'more', 'mainstream', 'films', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'would', 'like', 'work', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'simply', 'one', 'movie', 'here', 'there', 'Man', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language']",N/A

1003023,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000GFLKEY,Kaya Savas,"[62, 82]","MOVIE: Spike Lee has never been on my top list of directors. His movies usually have very strong social commentaries, and nothing more than that. Those social commentaries though are usually the same thing, and it always has to deal with race. Hell, he calls every one of his films ""A Spike Lee Joint"". I'm not against it, but it usually detracts from the story. Inside Man is really his first movie that really focuses on the narrative and is intent on telling an entertaining story. The film is his most mainstream film to date, and in my opinion is his best. Clive Owen plays a bank robber who decides to go Dog Day Afternoon style and perform an elaborate bank heist, but this theif has everything planned to perfection. The film opens right into the action and wastes no time. Denzel Washington plays the ""average joe"" hostage negotiator who is assigned to the case, and Chiwetel Ejiofor plays his partner. As the story progresses we learn more of what the true purpose of this bank heist is. The owner of the bank, played by Christopher Plummer, has a secret about his past that could destroy his repuation if released to the public and it happens to be located in an unlisted safety deposit box in that bank. He hires Jodie Foster to help him try and reason with Clive Owen's character, while all Denzel Washington is concerned about is serving justice. The film is quick, superbly edited, and extremely entertaining. Spike Lee doesn't compromise his techniques and the film still retains all of the familiar Lee social commentaries. Race and politics become the underlaying theme for the film and it moves it in the right direction. All the reviews and ads talk about the twist ending and a plot full of surprises. It's not that kind of movie, there isn't a Shyamalan twist waiting at the end of the movie, but there are a few secrets about the characters that are slowly revealed throughout. There are some surprises that will make you grin with shame becaue you didn't see them coming, and those are always fun. The racial and political theme is not overpowering, it's not what drives the film but rather enhances the character relations in the film. It's a really well put together piece of filmmaking. Sharp dialogue, light tone, and great entertainment make Inside Man a joint worth passing to the next person.ACTING: This is the dream cast that any director would kill for. Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, and Willem Dafoe headline this impressive ensamble. I mean, how can you have bad acting with a cast like this? It's impossible. The cast is so experienced that they make it look easy to pull off roles like these. The characters feel natural and real, and are emotionally involving. It's a great cast.BOTTOM LINE: Spike Lee proves himself to be a great storyteller. He focuses on the important things and highlights them with his personal touches. He even has his trademark ""floaty camera"" technique, which he uses to show determination on Denzel Washington's character's part. Even the opening titles and credits are done with style. He uses a very catchy song for the opening and closing credits that sets the perfect tone for the film. It's a song from Bollywood composer, A.R. Rahman. It's titled ""Chayya Chayya"". You can find the album on Amazon, it's the soundtrack to Dil Se.

It was a bank robbery movie - or was it? What kept me riveted were the performances of the central actors - Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington, etc....as well as the various moral ambiguities and twists and turns.It was not, however, totally plausable and for that reason I have to give it a less than stellar rating. Without giving too much away, I can only say that I found the central premise to be a bit hackneyed and the ending, such as it was, left too many loose ends.However, I HIGHLY recommend getting the DVD, if only because the bonus features are wonderful. There is an interview with Spike Lee and Denzel Washinton, a kind of retrospective of the movies they've made together, the challenges, the experiences they went through. THat was fascinating to view.Also, Spike Lee's commentary (if you choose that option) is also well worth hearing. He is a brilliant filmaker and his insights about how he composed various shots, how he envisioned this film, etc....offer much to budding scriptwriters, film students, actors or people who simply like to watch movies, even if they never want to be a part of a film crew.The film itself, however, left something to be desired, at least for me.

Without the cast the movie is a bit predictable so it's no wonder why Denzel and Clive were in this one.  Inside Man is about a bank robbery, then the rich man that owns the bank needs to get in there to get something that he wants to keep secret, this is a story that so far has low interest in it cause if someone like Peter Richards or Mike Justice were the leading actors no one would care about this movie. It gets better though when the plot thickens cause you don't exactly know what Clive and his buddies are there for, they don't want money. The tactics the robbers are using have never been seen before, like dressing all the hostages up in the same exact clothes as the robbers so the cops don't know who's who.So now you've got a raging Denzel who has to find a way to save more hostages especially when he sees one killed on camera and calm, cool, and relaxed Clive because he has everyone in the palm of his hands. The end of this movie isn't shocking but it's pretty darn good and it actually helps everyone get what they want. There's not much to say about Inside Man except amazing directing by Spike, amazing acting from everybody and a job well done on taking a mediocre script and turning it into something more.",4,Where's This Inside Man,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,1352,"['Man', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'cast', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'leading', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ugly', 'cast', 'movie', 'bit', 'predictable', 'wonder', 'why', 'Denzel', 'Clive', 'were', 'one', 'Man', 'bank', 'robbery', 'then', 'rich', 'man', 'bank', 'get', 'there', 'get', 'something', 'keep', 'secret', 'story', 'so', 'far', 'low', 'interest', 'cause', 'someone', 'Peter', 'Richards', 'Mike', 'Justice', 'were', 'leading', 'actors', 'one', 'would', 'care', 'movie', 'better', 'when', 'plot', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'what', 'Clive', 'buddies', 'are', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'money', 'tactics', 'robbers', 'are', 'using', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'dressing', 'hostages', 'up', 'same', 'exact', 'clothes', 'robbers', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'who.So', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'raging', 'Denzel', 'who', 'find', 'way', 'save', 'more', 'hostages', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'killed', 'camera', 'calm', 'cool', 'relaxed', 'Clive', 'everyone', 'palm', 'hands', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'actually', 'everyone', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'Inside', 'Man', 'amazing', 'directing', 'Spike', 'amazing', 'acting', 'everybody', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'taking', 'mediocre', 'script', 'turning', 'something', 'more']",N/A

However it is still an extremely fun ride and two of the actors, Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, deliver fantastic performances.  The jury is out on Clive Owen's accomplishments here.  OK, he's hampered by a mask but just the other day I saw what Hugo Weaving could do with an even bigger mask in V FOR VENDETTA and sorry, Clive Owen fans, your boy isn't really giving the part as much as he might.At the end I was a little bit puzzled about why the bank robbers had committed the crime.  Wish someone would explain it to me!  Was it just for the money--apparently not.  And why would our lead villain hold on for so many years to a document that incriminates him when he could have disposed of it at any time?  And also, how old is Christopher Plummer supposed to be, anyway?  I would say he would have to be around 90 for the story to really work.  Sorry, he doesn't look ninety.  However all these quibbles amount to Monday morning quarterbacking when one considers the brilliance of so much of the rest of Russell Gewirtz' ace screenplay, which gives us everything we want from a police procedural and more.Denzel's character this time out is a private man with strong ties to his job and his community but he's feeling those ties start to fray, especially when $140,000 worth of cash money has walked out the door under his watch during a recent check cashing sting operation, so for the first time he's on the defensive, very much so.  In his home life he is living with an extraordinarily sexy colleague whose young brother's a crackhead and lives in a cot together with them in a too-small apartment.  Situation volatile, but Keith Frazier doesn't sweat the small stuff.  Though it may seem as though Denzel has played this part a thousand times, he completely reinvents himself here and only once or twice does our normal Denzel sneak in, take a quick bow, and disappear again behind the Frazier mask.  I for one would enjoy seeing him and his partner solving another case, pitting against another super villain.  The partner is played by the British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor who was also in Spike Lee's crazy SHE HATE ME movie.  But mostly I remember him from being the bad guy in SERENITY.My favorite however is Jodie Foster.  It's excellent that Foster seems to be returning to films in a big way, what with this, FLIGHT PLAN, that French movie, and upcoming a new picture with Terrence Howard.  Though some dislike her for being cold and controlling, here she takes her worst flaws and really plays them up as Madeline White.  And girl, she looks good in a NYC ivory linen power suit with her long, long legs and hip swinging walk.  She's playing a woman who likes men, a lot of men, a lot of dangerous men.  All in all a different kind of part for Jodie Foster, and she looks like she's having a ball, good for her.",5,Outside Chance,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,2963,"[""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'enjoyed', '25th', 'HOUR', 'SUMMER', 'OF', 'SAM', 'INSIDE', 'MAN', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'high', 'standard', 'other', 'movies', 'However', 'still', 'extremely', 'fun', 'ride', 'two', 'actors', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'deliver', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'jury', 'out', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'accomplishments', 'here', 'OK', 'hampered', 'mask', 'just', 'other', 'day', 'saw', 'what', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'could', 'do', 'even', 'bigger', 'mask', 'V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', 'sorry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'fans', 'boy', ""n't"", 'really', 'giving', 'part', 'as', 'much', 'end', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'puzzled', 'about', 'why', 'bank', 'robbers', 'had', 'committed', 'crime', 'Wish', 'someone', 'would', 'explain', 'Was', 'just', 'money', 'apparently', 'not', 'why', 'would', 'lead', 'villain', 'hold', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'document', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'disposed', 'time', 'also', 'how', 'old', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'supposed', 'be', 'anyway', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'around', '90', 'story', 'really', 'work', 'Sorry', ""n't"", 'look', 'ninety', 'However', 'quibbles', 'amount', 'Monday', 'morning', 'quarterbacking', 'when', 'one', 'brilliance', 'so', 'much', 'rest', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'ace', 'screenplay', 'everything', 'want', 'police', 'procedural', 'more.Denzel', 'character', 'time', 'out', 'private', 'man', 'strong', 'ties', 'job', 'community', 'feeling', 'ties', 'start', 'fray', 'especially', 'when', '140,000', 'worth', 'cash', 'money', 'walked', 'out', 'door', 'watch', 'recent', 'check', 'cashing', 'sting', 'operation', 'so', 'first', 'time', 'defensive', 'very', 'much', 'so', 'home', 'life', 'living', 'extraordinarily', 'sexy', 'colleague', 'young', 'brother', 'crackhead', 'cot', 'together', 'too-small', 'apartment', 'Situation', 'volatile', 'Keith', 'Frazier', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'small', 'stuff', 'may', 'seem', 'Denzel', 'played', 'part', 'thousand', 'times', 'completely', 'here', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'normal', 'Denzel', 'sneak', 'take', 'quick', 'bow', 'disappear', 'again', 'Frazier', 'mask', 'one', 'would', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'partner', 'solving', 'case', 'pitting', 'super', 'villain', 'partner', 'played', 'British', 'actor', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'crazy', 'SHE', 'HATE', 'ME', 'movie', 'mostly', 'remember', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'SERENITY.My', 'favorite', 'however', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'excellent', 'Foster', 'be', 'returning', 'films', 'big', 'way', 'what', 'FLIGHT', 'PLAN', 'French', 'movie', 'upcoming', 'new', 'picture', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'dislike', 'being', 'cold', 'controlling', 'here', 'worst', 'flaws', 'really', 'up', 'Madeline', 'White', 'girl', 'good', 'NYC', 'ivory', 'linen', 'power', 'suit', 'long', 'long', 'legs', 'hip', 'swinging', 'walk', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'men', 'lot', 'men', 'lot', 'dangerous', 'men', 'different', 'kind', 'part', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'having', 'ball', 'good']",N/A

At times it seemed as if the movie was supposed to serve as an expose on the importance of wealth in contemporary America.  From a child's violent video game whose point is to get rich or die trying, to a wealthy mogul who made his fortune from one of the worst tragedies in history, Lee makes a point of showing that all that glitters is not gold.

1003032,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000GFLKEY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","""My name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself.""It is so great to go to a movie and have it fulfill high expectations for one.  The trailer and the television commercials for ""Inside Man"" piqued my curiosity, and since Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster signed on, and Spike Lee ended up directing the movie, I decided I had to go see the first showing the first day do that I could find out what exactly is the game going on with this bank robbery that is not a bank robbery.  I figured that armed with the idea that the perfect crime is the one that you do not know has been committed,Dalton Russell (Owen), the man who came up with this perfect crime, might not repeat himself, but the words he speaks into the camera at the beginning of the film are repeated when the revelation comes and you see the total audacity of his plan.  This is one of those movies where somebody tells you what they are doing and it does not matter because you are probably not going to figure it out (okay, some people will, but they are either smarter than me or we are talking the old saying about blind hogs).  Detective Keith Frazier (Washington), is in the hostage negotiator in charge, with fellow Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), at his side.  The bank in question belongs to Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) and clearly the last thing he is worried about is the money that is there.  So he contacts Madeliene White (Foster), who has always been the sort of woman who arranges thing for a nice but not necessarily small fee.It takes Frazier a while to catch on that the guy in charge inside the bank is the smartest one in the game (or, at the very least, he has all of the angles figured out).  Certainly when White comes away from her face-to-face with the masked man in the bank she knows that this guy is so far ahead of her she is never going to catch up.  But a key thing here is that these are smart people, capable of making mistakes but also able to make the necessary connections that lead to explaining what the hell is going on here.  Also, it was nice to see that the cops in this film were pretty competent for the most part, from the first cop on the scene to Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe), who is in charge of the tactical part of the operation.  I was wondering if this might be post-9/11 good will, but actually it is necessary for the film to work: the cops have to be competent.  The whole point is to beat them at their best.The screenplay is written by Russell Gewirtz, and since this is his first filmed script he is either going to be one of the hottest scribes in Hollywood or he is going to spend the rest of his life trying to prove this one is no fluke.  I think Spike Lee had a hand in some of the bits, simply because there are so few moments where ""Inside Man"" seems like a Spike Lee Joint and you remember who is directing this one (admit it: you were surprised this was a 40 Acres and Mule film).  Things really move in this one and you never get the sense of it being a drawn out hostage crisis.  Besides, it is also a way of not giving you time to figure out what is going on.  Even when we get flashforwards to Frazier and Mitchell interviewing the hostages (or are they the criminals?), the film is not doing us any real favors.Of course you want to try and figure out what is going on, because that is part of the fun.  As soon as ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"" starts playing I am trying to figure out what sort of clue this song from the ""Bombay Dreams"" cast album has to do with the story.  But Gewirtz is to us as Dalton is to the police; there is a point early one when you turn to each other and think you have spotted a key clue (off of the ""Ten Little Indians"" rule that if you do not see something, then it did not happen).  But this is just one of several insidious red herrings, some of which are brilliantly put in the commercials.  Afterwards if you stop and think about it you can find minor flaws in the story, but that is true of any such story.  When the last act begins I leapt to a correct conclusion, which got me thinking that when Frazier completed his interviews he would come to the same conclusion, albeit by a different method.  Even so, I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed by the way this one plays out.There are a few moments when Lee gets a bit cute with what he is doing (e.g., Denzel on a moving platform), but he is allowed to indulge.  Washington makes wearing a hat look good again and while the character Owen plays requires him to do the same sort of barely modulated monotone he always seems to be doing it is Foster who has the most fun playing a role without a scintilla of the vulnerability that are her trademark and reminding us there is a level beyond the b-word.  She has the cold smile of a snake down pretty good.  Final Note: As usual I was the only one who stuck around for all of the credits, but the totally addictive opening song comes back at the end, this time as a ""Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint"" variation.  Since I still had ice left in my drink, I was able to shake it as an impromptu percussion instrument, but I still have no clue as to what it signifies for the movie.",5,For my money this heist movie

A few scenes are particularly memorable, such as the scene in which Owen's character instructs the police to focus their cameras on the second floor window. Wow, that was shocking and eerie.Foster, Owen, Washington, and Plummer are on the short list of actors I admire. Lee has not been one of my favorite directors, but I love this movie, especially his attention to detail. For example, the bank used to be a Fallout shelter - you can see the yellow and black sign as people go down the stairs to the basement. I really liked the camerawork in the beginning, with closeups of statues and signs. Interesting soundtrack too, beginning and ending with an exotic Indian song that alludes to the multiculturalism of the setting and cast.Unfortunately though, Lee is clearly obsessed with breasts. This detracts from the maturity of this movie. Watching males act how they typically do around breasts is pathetic and demeaning to women AND men. I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could - sorry, I decided to round down instead of up.I used to work for a bank but was never involved in a robbery. The few mistakes of this movie, and most bank robbery movies, occur during the vault scenes.  The money is not supposed to be spread out on shelves, in plain view of whoever goes into the vault. It's really stored in steel lockers with separate combinations. It irritates me that most people imagine the money to be lying around, unprotected. Responsible banks wouldn't operate in that way. I realize this is just a movie, but give some credit to the bank for keeping the money properly protected.

I cannot even imagine him being any better, considering the body of work he has amassed during his career. Washington was eerily on point in ""Malcolm X"", smoothly sensual in ""Mo Better Blues"", and so intense in ""Training Day"" that he made me want to marry a thug!In this flick, he exhibits everything that makes Denzel a master at his craft. His character is arrogant, thuggish, and intuitive. While I'm not a fan of director Spike Lee's choice of projects over the years, I find his crisp cinematography, inventive camera angles, intelligent editing, and moving jazzy soundtracks very impressive and a dominant thread in all of his films. The growth in these areas are evident here, exhibiting an inter-dependent and mutually beneficial relationship in this, Washington and Lee's fourth film together.As for the other characters, Jodie Foster's talents are wasted - she just coasted through the film, with overtones of Clarice in ""Silence of the Lambs"". It seems as if she was included so that the movie trailer announcer could say ""Academy Award Winner"" twice! As for Clive Owen, this is the best that I have ever seen him, as charismatic and sympathetic as Hannibal Lechter. Chiwetel Ejiofor holds his own against the dominant Washington, giving the star the requisite amount of support and respect. The only person that I found totally out of place was that actress was who played Denzel's girlfriend. It took a lot more time than I usually allot to researching my reviews to find out who she was. I think her name is Cassandra Freeman. She had one film role before this and IT SHOWS! Her whole role could have been portrayed just as easily over the phone. In addition to Freeman's ""school play"" acting skills, her part was non-essential to the plot and far too young for the maturing Washington. She is a full THIRTY YEARS YOUNGER than Washington! What the ....?! For some reason, Hollywood seems to thrive on the older-man-way-too-much-younger-woman theme, instead of giving these female roles to ""les femmes d'un certain ge"". Look at whose dominating the box office and award shows: Helen Mirren (""The Queen""), Meryl Streep (""The Devil Wears Prada""), and Judi Dench (""Notes on a Scandal""), etc. I can see the director not wasting such a vapid role on a top actress but, either beef up the role to make it worthy of a Angela Bassett, or have the lines called in, ""Charlie's Angels""-style.",4,DENZEL & SPIKE HIT ONE OUTTA THE PARK AGAIN!,1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,2447,"['expected', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'excellent', 'form', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'imagine', 'being', 'better', 'considering', 'body', 'work', 'amassed', 'career', 'Washington', 'was', 'eerily', 'point', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'smoothly', 'sensual', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'so', 'intense', 'Training', 'Day', 'made', 'want', 'marry', 'thug', 'flick', 'everything', 'Denzel', 'master', 'craft', 'character', 'arrogant', 'thuggish', 'intuitive', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'choice', 'projects', 'years', 'find', 'crisp', 'cinematography', 'inventive', 'camera', 'angles', 'intelligent', 'editing', 'moving', 'jazzy', 'soundtracks', 'very', 'impressive', 'dominant', 'thread', 'films', 'growth', 'areas', 'are', 'evident', 'here', 'exhibiting', 'inter-dependent', 'mutually', 'beneficial', 'relationship', 'Washington', 'Lee', 'fourth', 'film', 'together.As', 'other', 'characters', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'just', 'coasted', 'film', 'overtones', 'Clarice', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'was', 'included', 'so', 'movie', 'trailer', 'announcer', 'could', 'say', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winner', 'twice', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'charismatic', 'sympathetic', 'Hannibal', 'Lechter', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'own', 'dominant', 'Washington', 'giving', 'star', 'requisite', 'amount', 'support', 'respect', 'only', 'person', 'found', 'totally', 'place', 'was', 'actress', 'was', 'who', 'played', 'Denzel', 'girlfriend', 'took', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'usually', 'allot', 'researching', 'reviews', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'think', 'name', 'Cassandra', 'Freeman', 'had', 'one', 'film', 'role', 'IT', 'SHOWS', 'whole', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'just', 'easily', 'phone', 'addition', 'Freeman', 'school', 'play', 'acting', 'skills', 'part', 'was', 'non-essential', 'plot', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'maturing', 'Washington', 'full', 'THIRTY', 'YEARS', 'YOUNGER', 'Washington', 'What', 'reason', 'Hollywood', 'thrive', 'older-man-way-too-much-younger-woman', 'theme', 'instead', 'giving', 'female', 'roles', 'les', 'femmes', ""d'un"", 'certain', 'ge', 'Look', 'dominating', 'box', 'office', 'award', 'shows', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'etc', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'not', 'wasting', 'such', 'vapid', 'role', 'top', 'actress', 'either', 'up', 'role', 'make', 'worthy', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'have', 'lines', 'called', 'Charlie', 'Angels', '-style']",N/A

Denzel Washington plays NYPD Detective Keith Frazier, who attempts to outsmart the mastermind of the bank robbery (Clive Owen). However, what appears to be an ""ordinary"" robbery/hostage situation turns out to be a personal vendetta to expose evil secrets from long ago. Throw Jodie Foster into the mix as a mysterious problem solver of sorts, and you end up with a very entertaining movie.There are quite a few holes in the plot, but ""Inside Man"" is definitely a lot of fun to watch, although I doubt I'll ever sit down and watch it again.

He and his gang of thieves infiltrate a large metropolitan bank and get caught inside.  Detective Frazier, who is struggling with an Internal Affairs problem of his own, as well as a girlfriend who's ready to tie the knot, gets called in to handle the negotiations.  Only the bank robbers aren't in any hurry to negotiate.  As the hours spin out, with SWAT teams ready to invade and a rich man growing more desperate by the minute, the plot twists and twists again as all of the characters play out their own agendas.  Frazier knows early on that this isn't a typical -- and may not be at all -- robbery.Spike Lee directed the movie.  He and Denzel Washington (Detective Frazier) have paired on MALCOLM X.  The director has had a string of movies, choosing material that he wanted to work with.  Denzel has been in MAN ON FIRE, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, OUT OF TIME, RICOCHET, JOHN Q, TRAINING DAY, THE BONE COLLECTOR, THE SIEGE, DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, and CRIMSON TIDE, all of which might be of interest to viewers of this film.  Jodie Foster has starred in FLIGHTPLAN, PANIC ROOM, and SHADOWS AND FOG.  Clive Owen has begun a successful American film career after enjoying one in England for several years.  He's starred in DERAILED, SIN CITY, and THE DRIVER.The movie progresses at a relatively slow pace, and doesn't really deepen any of the characters to any degree, but it does offer the viewer plenty of chances to guess what's going on.  The suspense mounts slowly, and the ending comes together in a manner that is almost anti-climatic.  The mood and atmosphere play out nicely, with enough characters introduced to make the situation even more complicated.  It's easy to watch and is entertaining in a what's-going-on way more than a thrill-a-minute way.  The film almost harkens back to the 1950s in its stylistic set-up and gentle, uncompressed storytelling.Once the movie is over, though, a thinking viewer will see a tremendous amount of plotholes as well as scenes that were actually distractions from the plot and red herrings to the mystery solvers.  But it did play fairly so that going back and putting the pieces together makes sense.  The final resolution of the stand-off at the bank was played almost too low-key to satisfy.  If it hadn't been for the question about what was actually going on still in play, viewers might tend to be disappointed.INSIDE MAN is a good movie for an evening home with a buddy who loves movies, or with a spouse.

1003049,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B000GFLKEY,Michael A. Newman,"[1, 1]","This is a very different hostage/bank robbery drama.  A group of bad guys led by Clive Owen take over a bank in lower Manhattan.  Instead of taking the money and running, Owen's band take all the people in the bank hostages and make them all wear the same uniform and masks that they are wearing (so the cops can't tell the good guys from the bad guys and neither can the hostages too as a matter of fact).  They then make it clear to the police that arrive on the scene outside that they have a hostage situation in the bank.Denzel Washington is called in to be the hostage negotiator for the police.  Washington was recently involved in a scandal that prevented him from getting a promotion.  In the meantime the Bank's CEO (Christopher Plummer) is meeting with Jodie Foster.  Apparently there is something in one of the bank's safe deposit boxes that Plummer wants protected.  This causes Foster to call in some favors (with the mayor and others) so she can be let into the bank without interference from Washington and talk to the bad guys directly.I keep saying this movie is very different.  Firstly you are never too sure what the bad guys want but you suspect it has to do with what Plummer doesn't want them to have.  Also the movie has some interesting directing and story telling which seems to go back and forth between the hostage standoff and interviews with people that were in the bank after everything was resolved.Washington and Owen both give brilliant performances and Willem DaFoe is excellent in a supporting role.  It is a well conceived and brilliantly executed movie.

Why is he doing it? What does he want? Well, Denzel doesnt think it's a bank robbery. There's someone off about this particular robbery in which the money isnt even taking. During the film we see Denzel and Chiwetel talking to hostages that were in the building because Clivey Boy had every single hostage strip and put on painters suits and masks which the robbers were wearing as well so it would confuse the police. Christopher Plummer (Sound of Music, The New World) plays Arthur Case the bank owner who goes to Madeline White played by Jodie Foster (Silence of the Lambs, Flightplan) who still beautiful at her age. There is something within the bank that holds value to Plummer which if it gets out could probably ruin Plummer. Which is basically why Owen is in the bank in the first place.

But they don't realize that Dalton is smarter than the average bank robber, and hostages constantly get whacked off. Complicating matters for the cops is Manhattan Trust's chairman of the board, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). A man with something to hide (in a secret safe-deposit box), Case hires power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to move and shake her way into the middle of the crisis, the better to protect Case's secret.If anything, Spike Lee is a good director. However, during the course of the new millennium, he has churned out a bunch of rancid comedy-dramas: ""Bamboozled"" (with Damon Wayans) and ""She Hate Me"" (with Anthony Mackie). The problem wasn't that Denzel Washington - Spike's trump card - wasn't in them. They just weren't funny or insightful. So cut to 2006, and we have ran into the director's latest opus, ""Inside Man"". Good news, it's a great thriller that finally reunites him with Washington, and casts plenty of famous white actors/actresses (including Willem Dafoe, Foster, Owen, and Plummer) in memorable roles.""Inside Man"" touches on plenty of topics, one of many is Lee's trademark - race. But here, he manages to get into a groove instead of struggling to find a consistent tone, and enters into ""25th Hour"" territory by using 9/11 archetypes a backdrop. An act of terror in a bustling bank bristles blacks, whites, Sikhs, Latinos, and Jews in equal measure. The cops on the scene hardly hold in their own prejudices, and Lee playfully frames the film with two versions of A.R. Rahman and Gulzar's hit Bollywood song ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"".There are also plenty of twists. We won't spoil too much for you, but as mentioned in the plot summary above, we know that Plummer's character has shady motives, and that Dalton may be doing more than just a heist.And let's not forget the performances. Washington once again pulls in another powerhouse performance playing Keith Frazier. He keeps dropping monologues, stays even-tempered (much like he did in ""Out of Time"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate""), plays cat-and-mouse games with Owen's bank robber, and shares some often humorous chemistry with Ejiofor (another great African-American actor, circa ""Four Brothers""). Of course, he can play this character in his sleep, and we'd praise him no matter what.

1003059,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,B000GFLKEY,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[3, 3]","Spike Lee has created an imaginative and gripping thriller with ""Inside Man"". Collecting some of the biggest names on screen, Lee has put together a film that has both the thrills and twists to entertain, and the comments on society to give something more when the credits have rolled by.Set in New York, the viewer enters the world of Dalton Russell, a bank robber with a so-called ""perfect plan"", and Detective Keith Frazier, who arrives to negotiate with the team of robbers. Add in the sub-plots of Arthur Case, who has a lot to lose in this robbery, and Madeleine White, a type of ""discrete"" agent with some less than legal influence, and you have a complex story line that gives you enough to think about to cope with a couple of viewings.The names filling the credits are impressive, making the movie all the more enjoyable. Jodie Foster, (White), Denzel Washington, (Frazier), Clive Owen, (Russell, a surprisingly good bad guy!), Christopher Plummer, (Case, and Willem Dafoe all make this movie special in their own ways. They are all top grade actors with the skills to make the story live.The social commentary is present all through the film at varying levels. For the most part, it is a subtle presence in the background, hardly making itself felt, but there none-the-less. At other moments, it is much more obvious. My own favourite scene is one betweem Dalton Russell and Brian, the young boy with his Playstation Portable and the violent games. Dalton asks about the game in which one has to do things such as kill and destroy people, (extremely graphically). Russell promises to have a word with Brian's father about the game. The entire movie is saturated with a social commentary on the corruption and violence that surrounds us, and a whole lot more.This is one of the best films I have seen recently and is a movie that has given me lots to think about and consider. It is powerful in its twists, well-acted and very well executed in all aspects. It is thoroughly enjoyable on a number of different levels.

1003063,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,B000GFLKEY,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""","[4, 5]","Lee himself would most likely (and with good reason) criticize me for this viewpoint, but I have always regarded him highly as a director, but have often felt at least a little disappointed by his films.  Even in highly competent movies like _25th Hour_ and _Do the Right Thing_, I have always felt that there was something about the movie, usually a rather simplistic move to get the movie towards a sense of completion, that has held me back from liking it unconditionally.  Perhaps it is that need for completion, that sense of making the movie an independent-from-life example for closure, that always keeps me a little away from full acceptance, because Lee is otherwise so good at characterizing beyond the screen--many of his characters exist in a wonderful netherworld of being familiar and gritty while maintaining purpose in the movie.  But in the end, the characters become obvious for merely 'being there' to make the film come together in the end when Lee drops the ball, so to speak.Yet I maintain so much hope for Lee and have more hope in him than in some other directors who DO seem to be at the top of their craft.  And I maintain that Lee will make something that is no less than one of the top 10 movies of ALL TIME if he is finally able to let go of cinematic closure and instead let the closure take place in the audience.This movie works pretty much on the typical Lee paradigm--nothing less than spectacular in its progress, and then falling a little short in the end.  Denzel Washington is an ambitious detective looking to make first grade when a bank robbery negotiation falls into his lap.  A major bank in NYC has been taken hostage by robbers who seem to have something up their sleeve other than the usual objectives.  The bank owner (Christopher Plummer) has a fear of dire consequences should certain items on hold in the bank fall into the wrong hands and hires Jodie Foster to take care of this mess with full discretion.The film is wonderfully off-kilter in how it presents criminals and villains and heroes--it is hard to see who is who for a long time, at first because of the grittiness of the characterization, but also because of the brilliance of the crime.  This film outdoes great depictions of criminal genius like _The Usual Suspects_ and others, for the nature and details of the crime are not all held to the very end.  Lee wisely avoids the modern trend of 'twist endings' such as the poor _Saw_ series and Shamalyan's paler efforts and instead lets us into the process, though of course withholding ocasional vital details to keep us guessing at the entire picture.The plot itself is interspersed with little Lee touches of NYC culture, where cops argue among themselves what dollar bills are made of, and a street construction worker can know the sound of Albanian without being able to understand a word of it.  For 7/8 of the movie, you will most likely be kept guessing and even laughing in disbelief, for this is no ordinary crime drama, and Washington of course enlivens his character into a depth few actors can reach......but the end of the movie will leave you just a little disappointed.  It would seem that a situation as wonderfully complex and intricate as Lee builds for and hour and forty-five minutes could never sum up very quickly and must leave you with at least SOMETHING you'll have to debate with others over some post-theatre Chinese food, but Lee cannot resist letting everyone fade into a cellular dark by the end of the movie, and so things wrap up just a little too nicely.  The movie does offer some good challenges as to who are the good guys and who are the bad (there will be just the slightest mention from Jodie Foster that will help, if you listen closely), but in the end _Inside Man_ wants to play with its own title in many different directions, but can't do it all within its own medium.  Lee is still on his way to earning the credit of being one of the all time greats, but he's going to have to keep his brilliance out until the end before the title is fully his.",4,Coulda been a 5...,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,4054,"['Lee', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'good', 'reason', 'criticize', 'viewpoint', 'have', 'always', 'regarded', 'highly', 'director', 'have', 'often', 'felt', 'least', 'little', 'disappointed', 'films', 'Even', 'highly', 'competent', 'movies', '_25th', 'Hour_', '_Do', 'Right', 'Thing_', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'something', 'movie', 'usually', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'move', 'get', 'movie', 'sense', 'completion', 'held', 'back', 'liking', 'unconditionally', 'Perhaps', 'need', 'completion', 'sense', 'making', 'movie', 'independent-from-life', 'example', 'closure', 'always', 'little', 'away', 'full', 'acceptance', 'Lee', 'otherwise', 'so', 'good', 'characterizing', 'screen', 'many', 'characters', 'exist', 'wonderful', 'netherworld', 'being', 'familiar', 'gritty', 'maintaining', 'purpose', 'movie', 'end', 'characters', 'become', 'obvious', 'merely', ""'being"", 'there', 'make', 'film', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'when', 'Lee', 'ball', 'so', 'speak.Yet', 'maintain', 'so', 'much', 'hope', 'Lee', 'have', 'more', 'hope', 'other', 'directors', 'who', 'DO', 'seem', 'be', 'top', 'craft', 'maintain', 'Lee', 'will', 'make', 'something', 'less', 'one', 'top', '10', 'movies', 'ALL', 'TIME', 'finally', 'able', 'let', 'go', 'cinematic', 'closure', 'instead', 'let', 'closure', 'take', 'place', 'audience.This', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'typical', 'Lee', 'paradigm', 'nothing', 'less', 'spectacular', 'progress', 'then', 'falling', 'little', 'short', 'end', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'ambitious', 'detective', 'looking', 'make', 'first', 'grade', 'when', 'bank', 'robbery', 'negotiation', 'lap', 'major', 'bank', 'NYC', 'been', 'taken', 'hostage', 'robbers', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'something', 'up', 'sleeve', 'other', 'usual', 'objectives', 'bank', 'owner', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'fear', 'dire', 'consequences', 'should', 'certain', 'items', 'hold', 'bank', 'fall', 'wrong', 'hands', 'hires', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'take', 'care', 'mess', 'full', 'discretion.The', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'off-kilter', 'how', 'criminals', 'villains', 'heroes', 'hard', 'see', 'who', 'who', 'long', 'time', 'first', 'grittiness', 'characterization', 'also', 'brilliance', 'crime', 'film', 'great', 'depictions', 'criminal', 'genius', '_The', 'Usual', 'Suspects_', 'others', 'nature', 'details', 'crime', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'held', 'very', 'end', 'Lee', 'wisely', 'modern', 'trend', ""'twist"", 'endings', 'such', 'poor', '_Saw_', 'series', 'Shamalyan', 'paler', 'efforts', 'instead', 'process', 'course', 'withholding', 'ocasional', 'vital', 'details', 'keep', 'guessing', 'entire', 'picture.The', 'plot', 'interspersed', 'little', 'Lee', 'touches', 'NYC', 'culture', 'where', 'cops', 'argue', 'what', 'dollar', 'bills', 'are', 'made', 'street', 'construction', 'worker', 'can', 'know', 'sound', 'Albanian', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'word', '7/8', 'movie', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'kept', 'guessing', 'even', 'laughing', 'disbelief', 'ordinary', 'crime', 'drama', 'Washington', 'course', 'character', 'depth', 'few', 'actors', 'can', 'reach', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'just', 'little', 'disappointed', 'would', 'seem', 'situation', 'wonderfully', 'complex', 'intricate', 'Lee', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'could', 'never', 'sum', 'up', 'very', 'quickly', 'must', 'leave', 'least', 'SOMETHING', ""'ll"", 'have', 'debate', 'others', 'post-theatre', 'Chinese', 'food', 'Lee', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'letting', 'everyone', 'fade', 'cellular', 'dark', 'end', 'movie', 'so', 'things', 'wrap', 'up', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'nicely', 'movie', 'offer', 'good', 'challenges', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'bad', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'slightest', 'mention', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'will', 'help', 'listen', 'closely', 'end', '_Inside', 'Man_', 'play', 'own', 'title', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'own', 'medium', 'Lee', 'still', 'way', 'earning', 'credit', 'being', 'one', 'time', 'greats', 'going', 'have', 'keep', 'brilliance', 'end', 'title', 'fully']",N/A

Chiwetel Ejiofor, one of my favourite actors, moving a couple more steps up his destined career ladder, puts on a convincing American accent (though maybe not quite a New York one) as Washington's keen and respectful sidekick.And just to make things even more interesting, enter Jodie Foster as mysterious power broker Madeline White, looking as slinky and sexy as I've ever seen her and with an agenda that seems only clear to her. It's a great story with many twists and turns and an ending that no one could possibly foresee. They say a jack-of-all-trades is very rarely the master of any. Spike Lee does an excellent job directing this movie and though he has had a number of culturally iconic successes in the past, this is the first movie I've seen where he directs and directs only. I think this one could be his most commercially successful as a result. Post-9/11 issues are raised and - as one would expect with Lee - this includes issues around race, particularly racial profiling but the issues are handled well and seem an integral part of the plot, rather than something that was just added on to make a point.A stellar support cast, including Christopher Plummer, Willem Defoe, Carlos Andres Gomez and the incomparable Peter Gerety make this a very watchable movie. The screenplay, written by Russell Gewirtz is rather convoluted and not everything makes perfect sense but this doesn't detract from the sheer entertainment value provided here. Even if it's only to finally be able to make complete sense of the storyline, this is a movie worth watching over and over.",4,Spike Lee does good!,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,1963,"['Clive', 'Owen', 'cucumber', 'cool', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'brains', 'cleverly', 'executed', 'Manhattan', 'bank', 'heist', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bank', 'heist', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'cynical', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'cum', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'who', 'more', 'met', 'match', 'Russell', 'Frazier', 'step', 'tension', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'one', 'favourite', 'actors', 'moving', 'couple', 'more', 'steps', 'destined', 'career', 'ladder', 'convincing', 'American', 'accent', 'maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'Washington', 'keen', 'respectful', 'sidekick.And', 'just', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'enter', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'mysterious', 'power', 'broker', 'Madeline', 'White', 'looking', 'slinky', 'sexy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'agenda', 'only', 'clear', 'great', 'story', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'ending', 'one', 'could', 'possibly', 'foresee', 'say', 'jack-of-all-trades', 'very', 'rarely', 'master', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'excellent', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'had', 'number', 'culturally', 'iconic', 'successes', 'past', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'only', 'think', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'commercially', 'successful', 'result', 'Post-9/11', 'issues', 'are', 'raised', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Lee', 'issues', 'race', 'particularly', 'racial', 'profiling', 'issues', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'seem', 'integral', 'part', 'plot', 'rather', 'something', 'was', 'just', 'added', 'make', 'point.A', 'stellar', 'support', 'cast', 'including', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'Carlos', 'Andres', 'Gomez', 'incomparable', 'Peter', 'Gerety', 'make', 'very', 'watchable', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'rather', 'convoluted', 'not', 'everything', 'perfect', 'sense', ""n't"", 'detract', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'value', 'provided', 'here', 'Even', 'only', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'complete', 'sense', 'storyline', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

As suspense films go, everything fits together when you get to the end with nothing that suspends belief (unlike another film I recently saw).  The acting is very well done.I gave the film only four stars because of the thoroughly gratuitous use of one very frequent four letter word.  Its use is so over the top that it takes away from everything else.  I saw the film in a theater.  Some months later we were on an overseas flight and ""Inside Man"" was the in-flight movie.  There were small children on the flight.  I wondered how that would work, given the ubiquitous use of that word.  Well, the word never occurred anywhere in the film!  Further, no one's lips were out of synchronization with the dialogue at any point. I have since read that Singapore will not allow films with foul language in them.

But the film has so many layers that need to be peeled back that such a spoiler alert is inconsequential...you won't see what's coming from one minute to the next.  Owen and his gang walk into a bank and commence an armed holdup, rounding up the staff and customers and stashing them in various rooms.  Their clever game becomes only a little clearer as they force their hostages to change into clothes identical to their own while they commence to do...whatever exactly they came there to do...that's not exactly clear.  The police show up in full force, led by Detectives Keith Frazier, played by Denzel Washington, and Bill Mitchell, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  The negotiations begin as the police try to get eyes and ears inside the bank, only to be foiled by the robbers at every turn.  Inserting herself into the mess is Madeleine White, played by Jodie Foster, a ""fixer"" recruited by the bank's founder, Arthur Case, played by Christopher Plummer, to retrieve an unknown item of extreme importance and secrecy from inside the bank.  All the while, Owen's and Washington's characters begin to bond and chat somewhat amicably.  I won't say more except to tell you to watch the film.  As far as suspense films go, this is top-notch.  There are layers upon layers as every character tries to fulfill their own agenda and you will not want to miss a second of it.  All of the cast are flawless and my only complaint is that this film isn't longer.  But perhaps it's set at just the right amount of time...I don't know...I'm no expert.  Just go watch the film.

So we tend to go to the theatre a bit more during the summer, and use their air conditioning.It is a worthwhile action movie with enough twists to laugh and be puzzled about. I missed the main point despite it being pretty obvious (not jail but the hidding place), didn't see the diamond pass off coming but certainly laughed when it happened. Which is my general reaction to the movie, i laughed and enjoyed the plot and twists, got them mostly after the fact, rather then predicting them, which i appreciate. (i didn't get the sewer pipe for instance, before it was obvious)Making the chief bankrobber a really nice guy, fake guns, switching their own people into the little groups were well done pieces. Making the cops bungling but sincere fools chasing their shadows was pulled off well, probably because of the talented acting by Denzel Washington. Making the goal elusive yet highly moral with Jodie Foster in the employ of a bad guy with a bad conscience really helps for the realistic believability of the plot. A few unexplained problems don't seem to bother the overall quality (how did he know were it was?), something that often disturbs detective cop type movies in the final analysis.It's good, mind involving entertainment, with a few interesting questions brought up but not really followed(expiation of guilt), the plot twists and action being the main big point.Worthwhile to watch in the theatre but i'm not sure if i owed the DVD that i'd watch it again, it is trying to figure out the plot twists that make the movie, once you know them it is not nearly as involving.thanks for reading this short review.

1003089,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000GFLKEY,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","This is going to be (for me) a brief review for the simple reason that without delving into the content of the film I find it hard to write about except in the most glittering of generalities.  And this really is a film that would be more enjoyable the less one knows about it.  So let me cut to the chase if you haven't seen this but are tempted:  it will be worth your time.This is not at all your typical Spike Lee film.  In almost all of his films, Lee has been concerned to make a social statement of sorts, and while I am completely in sympathy with his social and political beliefs, they have sometimes lessened the films as vehicles for telling stories (though DO THE RIGHT THING was made even better by the message, being one of the best political films ever made in America).  The point here is to tell a great yarn and there is little question the film succeeds wonderfully.All I'll say about the content of the film is that it involves a bank robbery and hostage situation.  Comparisons to DOG DAY AFTERNOON utterly miss the point of the film.  If you are thinking, ""DOG DAY AFTERNOON"" you are in the wrong frame of mind.  It is a film in which nothing is what it seems.  And even in saying that I've said too much, so let me just usher another encouragement to see the film and hand out some kudos.Denzel Washington is, well, Denzel Washington.  He is one of the finest actors of his generation and while this is not one of his best performances, it is one of his typical ones.  Clive Owen is spectacular as the head of the group taking over the bank.  He is an enormously gifted performer and ever since seeing him in THE CROUPIER I have been waiting to see his career explode.  He has one of the great gazes in the movies, and one of those performers who seems to glide between being congenial to utterly threatening in a matter of seconds.  Jodie Foster is a great actress, but though she is enormously competent in her part, it really isn't one designed to let her shine.  Likewise, Willem Dafoe is a frequently compelling actor, but he is largely on the sidelines in this one.  Ditto the amazing Chiwetel Ejiofor, a handsome and extremely talented English actor of Nigerian parentage who I believe is only a role or two away from stardom.  He is appealing here as Washington's partner, but he isn't given any opportunity to show what he can doe.  For a better sense of his talent, check out his work in DIRTY PRETTY THINGS or his turn as a true believing assassin in the Sci-fi gem SERENITY.The real star of the film, however, is not Spike Lee or any of his actors.  It is writer Russell Gewirtz, who with this script makes his screen debut.  This is a wonderfully constructed, deliciously complex script.  It results in one of those movies you love to pry apart and dissect afterwards, to see if it makes as much sense afterwards as it did when you were watching it.  The rumor is that Ron Howard was going to direct this originally, but pulled out in favor of directing CINDERELLA MAN.  With no disrespect to either Howard or Lee, my guess is that the original script was so good that it would have been difficult to make a bad movie out of it.So far 2006 has looked like another slow movie year, though there is plenty of time for that to turn around.  Although for most of my adult life I have seen roughly 300-450 movies a year (one year I saw 600, with nearly daily double headers on the VCR), in recent years I have shifted my attention more and more towards TV, the best TV shows being better, in my opinion, than the vast majority of films.  This is not a film that will win any awards, but it a thoroughly entertaining film that I hope will be a prelude to better things to come out of Hollywood this year.",5,Spike Lee's most entertaining film to date,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,3734,"['going', 'be', 'brief', 'review', 'simple', 'reason', 'delving', 'content', 'film', 'find', 'hard', 'write', 'most', 'glittering', 'generalities', 'really', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'less', 'one', 'So', 'let', 'cut', 'chase', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'are', 'tempted', 'will', 'be', 'time.This', 'not', 'typical', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'almost', 'films', 'Lee', 'been', 'concerned', 'make', 'social', 'statement', 'sorts', 'am', 'completely', 'sympathy', 'social', 'political', 'beliefs', 'have', 'sometimes', 'lessened', 'films', 'vehicles', 'telling', 'stories', 'DO', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'THING', 'was', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'message', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'political', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'America', 'point', 'here', 'tell', 'great', 'yarn', 'little', 'question', 'film', 'wonderfully.All', ""'ll"", 'say', 'content', 'film', 'bank', 'robbery', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Comparisons', 'DOG', 'DAY', 'AFTERNOON', 'utterly', 'miss', 'point', 'film', 'are', 'thinking', 'DOG', 'DAY', 'AFTERNOON', 'are', 'wrong', 'frame', 'mind', 'film', 'nothing', 'what', 'even', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'said', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'let', 'just', 'usher', 'encouragement', 'see', 'film', 'hand', 'out', 'kudos.Denzel', 'Washington', 'well', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'generation', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'one', 'typical', 'ones', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'spectacular', 'head', 'group', 'taking', 'bank', 'enormously', 'gifted', 'performer', 'ever', 'seeing', 'THE', 'CROUPIER', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'career', 'explode', 'one', 'great', 'gazes', 'movies', 'one', 'performers', 'who', 'glide', 'being', 'congenial', 'utterly', 'threatening', 'matter', 'seconds', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'great', 'actress', 'enormously', 'competent', 'part', 'really', ""n't"", 'one', 'designed', 'let', 'shine', 'Likewise', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'frequently', 'compelling', 'actor', 'largely', 'sidelines', 'one', 'amazing', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'handsome', 'extremely', 'talented', 'English', 'actor', 'Nigerian', 'parentage', 'who', 'believe', 'only', 'role', 'two', 'away', 'stardom', 'appealing', 'here', 'Washington', 'partner', ""n't"", 'given', 'opportunity', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'doe', 'better', 'sense', 'talent', 'check', 'out', 'work', 'DIRTY', 'PRETTY', 'THINGS', 'turn', 'true', 'believing', 'assassin', 'Sci-fi', 'gem', 'SERENITY.The', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'actors', 'writer', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'who', 'script', 'screen', 'debut', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'deliciously', 'complex', 'script', 'results', 'one', 'movies', 'love', 'pry', 'apart', 'dissect', 'afterwards', 'see', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'afterwards', 'did', 'when', 'were', 'watching', 'rumor', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'going', 'direct', 'originally', 'pulled', 'out', 'favor', 'directing', 'CINDERELLA', 'MAN', 'disrespect', 'Howard', 'Lee', 'guess', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'make', 'bad', 'movie', 'it.So', 'far', '2006', 'looked', 'slow', 'movie', 'year', 'plenty', 'time', 'turn', 'around', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'have', 'seen', 'roughly', '300-450', 'movies', 'year', 'one', 'year', 'saw', '600', 'nearly', 'daily', 'double', 'headers', 'VCR', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'shifted', 'attention', 'more', 'more', 'towards', 'TV', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'being', 'better', 'opinion', 'vast', 'majority', 'films', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'win', 'awards', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'prelude', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'year']",N/A
1003090,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B000GFLKEY,Robert Morris,"[1, 2]","I have seen most of Spike Lee's previous films, admiring some more than others. To me, he resembles the proverbial little girl with the curl. That said, I think his Inside Man is very, very good in most respects. Four compelling screen actors so thoroughly inhabit the characters entrusted to them that -- as with Jamie Foxx in Ray and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote -- they are the characters whom they portray. I was intrigued by the lively interaction between and among Detective Keith Frazier, Madeline White, Dalton Russell, and Arthur Chase rather than recognizing Washington, Foster, Owen, and Plummer at work. One Star for that. I also admire Lee's juxtaposition of  volatile plot developments with moments of quiet, almost lyrical reflection. Another Star for pace. And praise, also,  to the cinematographer (Matthew J. Libatque), the composer of the score (Terence Blanchard), and especially the screenwriter Russell Gewitz) for collaborating so effectively with Lee to integrate image, sound, and dialogue from beginning to end. That's Three Stars so far.Add another for a meticulously planned bank robbery which Lee develops smoothly but unhurriedly within a multi-dimensional plot featuring the robbery itself as well as high-level power brokering within and beyond the NYPD and even City Hall. Lee and Gewitz share the credit for this. Others who have reviewed this film cite similarities with other films such as Dog Day Afternoon and there are a few but make no mistake about it: Inside Man is in no way derivative of any others. I think it is unique, albeit comparable with L.A. Confidential, Heat, and Pulp Fiction in terms of its brilliant examination of cultural ambiguities.As for the last Star, whether or not those who see this film share Lee's perspectives on race relations, whether or not they share his social values, I suggest that he is wholly consistent with those perspectives and values while exploring in this film a multiple of interpersonal relationships which include but are not --ultimately -- defined by racial issues. In fact, racial issues are subordinate to the narrative which he so carefully develops. The situation initially seems to be a crisis with life-or-death implications for the hostages as well as for those committed to rescuing them. By the end of this film, however, we realize that Lee's primary purpose is to tell an entertaining, at times compelling story rather than to exploit the on-going drama as a means by which to express a polemic.Well-done.",5,Lee's Most Cohesive Film,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,2510,"['have', 'seen', 'most', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'previous', 'films', 'admiring', 'more', 'others', 'proverbial', 'little', 'girl', 'curl', 'said', 'think', 'Inside', 'Man', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'respects', 'Four', 'compelling', 'screen', 'actors', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'inhabit', 'characters', 'entrusted', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ray', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'are', 'characters', 'whom', 'portray', 'was', 'intrigued', 'lively', 'interaction', 'Detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'Madeline', 'White', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'Arthur', 'Chase', 'rather', 'recognizing', 'Washington', 'Foster', 'Owen', 'Plummer', 'work', 'One', 'Star', 'also', 'admire', 'Lee', 'juxtaposition', 'volatile', 'plot', 'developments', 'moments', 'quiet', 'almost', 'lyrical', 'reflection', 'Star', 'pace', 'praise', 'also', 'cinematographer', 'Matthew', 'J.', 'Libatque', 'composer', 'score', 'Terence', 'Blanchard', 'especially', 'screenwriter', 'Russell', 'Gewitz', 'collaborating', 'so', 'effectively', 'Lee', 'integrate', 'image', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'beginning', 'end', 'Three', 'Stars', 'so', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Lee', 'smoothly', 'unhurriedly', 'multi-dimensional', 'plot', 'featuring', 'robbery', 'as', 'well', 'high-level', 'power', 'brokering', 'NYPD', 'even', 'City', 'Hall', 'Lee', 'Gewitz', 'share', 'credit', 'Others', 'who', 'have', 'reviewed', 'film', 'cite', 'similarities', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'are', 'few', 'make', 'mistake', 'Inside', 'Man', 'way', 'derivative', 'others', 'think', 'unique', 'comparable', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Heat', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'terms', 'brilliant', 'examination', 'cultural', 'ambiguities.As', 'last', 'Star', 'not', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'share', 'Lee', 'perspectives', 'race', 'relations', 'not', 'share', 'social', 'values', 'suggest', 'wholly', 'consistent', 'perspectives', 'values', 'exploring', 'film', 'multiple', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'include', 'are', 'not', 'ultimately', 'defined', 'racial', 'issues', 'fact', 'racial', 'issues', 'are', 'subordinate', 'narrative', 'so', 'carefully', 'situation', 'initially', 'be', 'crisis', 'life-or-death', 'implications', 'hostages', 'as', 'well', 'committed', 'rescuing', 'end', 'film', 'however', 'realize', 'Lee', 'primary', 'purpose', 'tell', 'entertaining', 'times', 'compelling', 'story', 'rather', 'exploit', 'on-going', 'drama', 'means', 'express', 'polemic.Well-done']",N/A

It seems to be a table full of pieces that just don't fit together.For example, what was Jodi Foster doing in this movie? What did her character accomplish? What did Christopher Plummer get, or think he had gotten, when he handed that check over to her? She doesn't seem to perform any function here, other than to cut a fine female figure.It seems we have a lot of A-List stars strutting their stuff, in search of a logical script. Denzel Washington basically reprises his role as Malcolm X. Well, he's a hostage negotiator here rather than a civil rights leader. But he stands and delivers with the same quick, snappy patter. He strides down the street with the same confident air, right down to the way he shears the brim of his hat jauntily into place.Jodi Foster may uncharacteristically play a character of dubious morality in this film. But she tackles her assignment with characteristic intelligence and command. In the same way, most of the actors are playing to type, and do not stretch beyond their usual projections. They all meet in the arena of this bank hesit in the personas we have come to associate with them. But these good actors don't form an ensemble. They aren't given a logical reason for occupying the same screen space.I said that this movie was like a jigsaw puzzle with some pieces missing. Actually, it's worse. The pieces we have are colorful shards that form some interesting patterns as they twist and turn. But they ultimately seem to come from several different pictures altogether.The whole movie is like its concluding music.

In the case of Inside Man, don't expect to feel the back of your chair any time between when the bank robbers roll into the lobby and the end credits. Actually you may not even lean back into your seat until long after the credits finish rolling as you sit and try to comprehend what just happened and ponder if you should watch it again. Granted if you listen to the opening soliloquy (the dude even tells you to listen carefully), the ending shouldn't be at all puzzling.So what we have here is your basic bank heist. Guys (and a girl) go into a bank with guns waving; soon the cops arrive to make sure they get don't get away while making sure none of the hostages are harmed. But you quickly realize this isn't your ordinary game of cops and robbers. On one side you have Denzel Washington (Remember the Titans) as a detective and negotiator assigned to the case. Naturally he has some skeletons in his past namely some money that went missing from his previous case. On the other side of the law is Clive Owen (Closer) as the ringleader of the robbers who give a powerful performance despite spending the majority of the movie behind a mask, sunglasses and hooded sweatshirt.At the peripheral of the case is Christopher Plummer (Must Love Dogs) who owns the bank yet seems to care less about the money inside the vault than something locked away in a security deposit box. That's where Jodie Foster (Freaky Friday, no not the crappy Lindsay Lohan one, the original) comes in, she's the person you call when you need something done, and done discretely. Almost a character despite never seen on screen is director Spike Lee turns the bank robbery into a bigger issue that also deals with race, class, and sex and is still able to feature his longtime collaborator, New York City itself even though most of the action takes place in the bank and a police trailer. And Spike had plenty to work with thanks to Russell Gewirtz, who throws in plenty of one-liners in between all the tense scenes leaving you laughing only to then wonder if you should have or not considering the overall tone of the movie.

1003101,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000GFLKEY,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 4]","Spike Lee has never been known for his subtlety.  He makes powerful films that are often smart (""Do the Right Thing""), occasionally not (""She Hate Me""), and sometimes brilliant (""Malcolm X,"" ""4 Little Girls""), but there is never any question that Spike's first goal is to make an emotionally powerful film.Lee departs drastically from past practice with ""Inside Man,"" a hyper-smart heist movie that adopts all the tricks of the genre.  While no ""heist movie"" is ever going to rise to the hallowed heights of ""The Sting"" in movie lore, Lee has made one heck of an enjoyable movie.Clive Owen plays criminal ringleader Dalton Russell, and he tells the audience in the opening scene (shattering the fourth wall) that he has done a bank job, and here's how he did it.  In broad daylight, Russell leads a handful of thieves into the downtown Manhattan branch of a powerful bank, founded in 1948 by Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).  Within moments, Russell has taken about forty hostages and has the bank surrounded by cops and media.  And yet he hasn't touched the money and seems hardly perturbed.  Why?This question dogs lead detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and his sidekick, Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  It's clear that Frazier and Mitchell are used to being smarter than the criminals they face, but Russell is clearly in a different league.Further muddying the waters is the appearance on the scene of Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) as a woman hired by Case to protect his interests in the bank . . . interests that are contained in security box 392.  Miss White (there's the trademark Lee subtlety at work) is the kind of person who gets to patronize the mayor of Manhattan and lord her power over mere mortals such as Detectives Frazier and Mitchell.  It's clear that Foster relishes this chance to play perhaps the biggest witch of her career, even if one wishes that Miss White were on screen a bit more.The heist proceeds through its paces with the typical cadence of move and countermove by police and criminal.  To summarize any more would be to give the game away, but like all great heist movies, ""Inside Man"" keeps you guessing right up until the very end.  The fact that upon reflection the whole story is completely ridiculous is beside the point - heist movies are more about style and wit than logic, and are at their best when one player is able to move among the others as if he or she has had an advance peek at the screenplay.Lee generally eschews his trademark focus on racial issues, and the few scenes where these arise feel contrived and beside the point.  Fortunately, Lee never lets the movie get bogged down in these moments, and to his credit, spends about as much time with sexism as he does racism.But never fear - this is an intelligent heist movie made by a talented, dedicated filmmaker.  Solid work by the entire cast makes ""Inside Man"" a pleasure to watch - Mr. Lee and his team should be very proud, and it's not surprising that this movie has been Lee's biggest box office hit yet, and a sequel appears to be in the works.",4,"Shamelessly clever, witty, twisty-turny intellectual thriller from Spike Lee",1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,3076,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'never', 'been', 'known', 'subtlety', 'powerful', 'films', 'are', 'often', 'smart', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'occasionally', 'not', 'Hate', 'Me', 'sometimes', 'brilliant', 'Malcolm', 'X', '4', 'Little', 'Girls', 'never', 'question', 'Spike', 'first', 'goal', 'make', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'film.Lee', 'departs', 'drastically', 'past', 'practice', 'Inside', 'Man', 'hyper-smart', 'heist', 'movie', 'tricks', 'genre', 'heist', 'movie', 'ever', 'going', 'rise', 'hallowed', 'heights', 'Sting', 'movie', 'lore', 'Lee', 'made', 'one', 'heck', 'enjoyable', 'movie.Clive', 'Owen', 'criminal', 'ringleader', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'audience', 'opening', 'scene', 'shattering', 'fourth', 'wall', 'done', 'bank', 'job', 'here', 'how', 'did', 'broad', 'daylight', 'Russell', 'handful', 'thieves', 'downtown', 'Manhattan', 'branch', 'powerful', 'bank', 'founded', '1948', 'Arthur', 'Case', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'moments', 'Russell', 'taken', 'forty', 'hostages', 'bank', 'surrounded', 'cops', 'media', 'yet', ""n't"", 'touched', 'money', 'hardly', 'perturbed', 'Why', 'question', 'dogs', 'lead', 'detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'sidekick', 'Bill', 'Mitchell', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'clear', 'Frazier', 'Mitchell', 'are', 'used', 'being', 'smarter', 'criminals', 'face', 'Russell', 'clearly', 'different', 'league.Further', 'muddying', 'waters', 'appearance', 'scene', 'Madeleine', 'White', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'woman', 'hired', 'Case', 'protect', 'interests', 'bank', 'interests', 'are', 'contained', 'security', 'box', '392', 'Miss', 'White', 'trademark', 'Lee', 'subtlety', 'work', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'patronize', 'mayor', 'Manhattan', 'lord', 'power', 'mere', 'mortals', 'such', 'Detectives', 'Frazier', 'Mitchell', 'clear', 'Foster', 'chance', 'play', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'witch', 'career', 'even', 'one', 'Miss', 'White', 'were', 'screen', 'bit', 'more.The', 'heist', 'proceeds', 'paces', 'typical', 'cadence', 'move', 'countermove', 'police', 'criminal', 'summarize', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'game', 'away', 'great', 'heist', 'movies', 'Man', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'fact', 'reflection', 'whole', 'story', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'point', 'heist', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'style', 'wit', 'logic', 'are', 'best', 'when', 'one', 'player', 'able', 'move', 'others', 'had', 'advance', 'peek', 'screenplay.Lee', 'generally', 'trademark', 'focus', 'racial', 'issues', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'arise', 'feel', 'contrived', 'beside', 'point', 'Fortunately', 'Lee', 'never', 'movie', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'moments', 'credit', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'sexism', 'racism.But', 'never', 'fear', 'intelligent', 'heist', 'movie', 'made', 'talented', 'dedicated', 'filmmaker', 'Solid', 'work', 'entire', 'cast', 'Inside', 'Man', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'team', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'proud', 'not', 'surprising', 'movie', 'been', 'Lee', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'yet', 'sequel', 'be', 'works']",N/A

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[1, 1]","Inside Man is a new film by acclaimed director Spike Lee (Do The Right Thing), and stars Denzel Washington (Training Day), Clive Owen (Sin City), Christopher Plummer (Syriana), and Jodie Foster (Flightplan). Inside Man would be the latest collaboration between Lee and Washington, after such films as 1992's Malcolm X, and 1998's He Got Game.Spike Lee surprises audiences this time around with a suspenseful heist thriller, a territory that he hadn't experimented with up until Inside Man.Clive Owen plays bank robber Dalton, who leads a gang into a New York City bank one day, forces the hostages to wear the same clothes they are wearing including black hoodies and white masks. Washington plays troubled detective Keith Frazier, who is trying to negotiate with Dalton to let hostages go and find out what he wants. In the meantime, bank owner Arthur Case, played by Plummer, is afraid the robbers might uncover a secret document in one of the safe boxes in the bank, so he assigns a tough-as-nails problem solver named Madeline White, played by Foster, to try to strike a deal with the robbers. What Frazier is about to uncover are deep secrets and a very unexpected surprise as the events unfold.Despite some flaws and a few vague characters, I enjoyed Inside Man. Denzel Washington, as usual, delivers a fine performance, and Spike Lee's direction is right on target.RecommendedB",4,Inside Man...is right on target!,1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,1384,"['Man', 'new', 'film', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'stars', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Training', 'Day', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Sin', 'City', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Syriana', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Flightplan', 'Man', 'would', 'be', 'latest', 'collaboration', 'Lee', 'Washington', 'such', 'films', '1992', 'Malcolm', 'X', '1998', 'Got', 'Game.Spike', 'Lee', 'audiences', 'time', 'around', 'suspenseful', 'heist', 'thriller', 'territory', 'had', ""n't"", 'experimented', 'up', 'Inside', 'Man.Clive', 'Owen', 'bank', 'robber', 'Dalton', 'who', 'gang', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'bank', 'one', 'day', 'hostages', 'wear', 'same', 'clothes', 'are', 'wearing', 'including', 'black', 'hoodies', 'white', 'masks', 'Washington', 'troubled', 'detective', 'Keith', 'Frazier', 'who', 'trying', 'negotiate', 'Dalton', 'let', 'hostages', 'go', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'meantime', 'bank', 'owner', 'Arthur', 'Case', 'played', 'Plummer', 'afraid', 'robbers', 'might', 'uncover', 'secret', 'document', 'one', 'safe', 'boxes', 'bank', 'tough-as-nails', 'problem', 'solver', 'named', 'Madeline', 'White', 'played', 'Foster', 'try', 'strike', 'deal', 'robbers', 'What', 'Frazier', 'uncover', 'are', 'deep', 'secrets', 'very', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'events', 'unfold.Despite', 'flaws', 'few', 'vague', 'characters', 'enjoyed', 'Inside', 'Man', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'usual', 'fine', 'performance', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'direction', 'right', 'target.RecommendedB']",N/A

1003112,A21XDUIO2A4B8J,B000GFLKEY,Stephen Paul Ives-Butterfield,"[1, 3]","Screenwriter Russel Gewirtz is an original artist.  So, you see, it's not up to him to tell us that his story, ""Inside Man"", is schooled by over 600 years of Chaucer-on-his-way-to-Canterbury.  He's right to leave such correlations to students of literature.The reason that so many reviewers get lost in the film's last few minutes is that they are so sold on their just having seen a really good bank heist film that there's no room for two or more gang members using the heist for vigilante justice.In those last few minutes, Clive Owen's character (heist leader, Dalton Russell) has handed off the prize of the heist--the Cartier diamond, war crimes ring--to a very sharp detective-cop (Denzel Washington).  In the proverbial back seat, the Rabbi gang member is devastated.  The ring was to have come to him so that a Fortune-500 war criminal could get his justice at Jewish hands revenging the Jewish Holocaust.  After all, it was surely his Shoah network that provided the inside information on war criminal Arthur Case, his 1948-built bank, and his Safe Deposit Box 392--in which the Cartier ring and 11 bags of loose diamonds lay waiting.Dalton Russell seemingly knows intuitively--after sounding out the cop thoroughly--that when Russell directs the cop to 'Follow The Ring', there'll be no rest for the cop until knowledge of the war crimes has ruined Arthur Case.  How much, the cop asks the war criminal, will all those people approve of you when they know the truth behind this ring?Clearly, in Dalton Russell's (fictious) mind, the cop's path to ""Murder will out"" will be superior to the Rabbi's path.The Chaucerian tale has one overarching requirement.  It must be told successfully from multiple perspectives.  The listener-reader-viewer must see distinctly the many perspectives that are at work in the telling of the tale.  Such perception is only available when the perspective is true to the teller's character.  Any out-of-character stretch and the perspective falls flat.Such artistry cannot be done--in literature--with flat, two-dimensional, stereotypical characters.  It only happens in stories such as ""Inside Man"" because of the author's rich, clarity producing characters.  Gewirtz produces the characters who stay inside themselves and tell a hellava tale in the offing.As near as I can determine, Russell Gewirtz is not a Chaucerian scholar--legal scholar yes, Chaucerian scholar no.  He probably does not intend for his Vigilante's Tale to take a hallowed place on the list that includes ""The Knight's Tale"", ""Friar's Tale"", ""Summoner's Tale"", or ""The Pardoner's Tale""--just to mention a few.  From a 2006 interview done by Angela Cranon, Gewirtz is simply driven by originality.However, in this modern day's Black Plague of corporate greed and political corruption driving many vigilante pilgrims on a journey to Cantebury-on-the-Guillotine, there's more than enough reason to honor Gewirtz'""Inside Man"" as ""The Vigilante's Tale"".  The class warfare of covering the war criminals' retreat from the Holocaust--their getting help simply because they are the monied elite class standing against the unwashed--should be covered early in this Canteburian journey.  ""The Vatican Ratlines to benefit the murderous front line of the Fortune 500 is compassionate and praiseworthy, so nobody is guilty"" is sophistic hogwash.  Too many of the murderous war-crimes guilty were rewarded with cushy, retribution-free lives.Will modern-day corporate greed and political corruption convince the unwashed that the superrich and their puppet  governments--who do not enforce laws against cronnies, who in fact break laws; who do not protect citizen rights aganst cronnies, who in fact violate citizen rights-- should be taken all the way to the next revolution's guillotine?While the journey is still being traveled, we should be alive to the many more good vigilante tales.  Filmmakers are immitating life across the spectrum of vigilante nuances, while shrouding the vigilante content with marketing department, action-thriller hype.  ""Inside Man"" is hyped as ""A heist thriller like you've never seen"" and as ""A cool, captivating cat-and-mouse game"".  It's an ""intensive and explosive crime thriller"", a ""perfect bank robbery"", and the Wall Street Journal--with skeletons to keep buried--calls it ""a heist film that's right on the money"".  Nobody from marketing or Corporatism wants to point out the vigilante content.  The word, 'vigilante', is absent from all the hype.Artists such as Russell Gewirtz can not only illuminate our way, they might very well help us to moderate the coming revolution into something more legal, more reasonable, and less bloody.  We might not have to snap, as the French did in the late 1780s, when we suddenly realize that the unwashed are the only producers of the real wealth being massively stolen by the monied elites.From the large number of reviewers who were confused by the ending of ""Inside Man"", it's fair to conclude that we need lots of pre-revolution illumination and moderation.Orchids and Onions to some of the players.Clive Owen is Dalton Russell and is PERFECT.Denzel Washington owns the role of Det. Keith Frazier.  Role ownership seems to be one of Washington's favorite things.Chiwetel Ejiofor is Frazier's partner, Det. Bill Mitchel.  He plays his own man and should have been showered in Best Supporting awards.Jodie Foster walked into a brilliantly written role for the power-broker, Madeline White, and turned it into some sort of unreal stump--with her incessant over-grinning and over-wide-smiling.  Did she think it made her character more menancing?  Kicked me out ot the story almost every time she appeared.  I'm happy with her career's success.  She deserves it.  But this performance was down under the toilet's rim.Christopher Plummer is super-smooth, Chairman-of-the-Board Arthur Case.  He's the haunted BG war criminal, trying to cover up the help that he did not give to wealthy Jewish banking friends who were crushed lifeless in Nazi camps--because the Nazis paid him too well.  He's PERFECT.Willem Dafoe is police Capt. John Darius and is PERFECT.  Big spectrum of command and perception.The contributing minor characters, all of them full-tail after even a few spoken sentences, are too many to list here.  They're all what it takes to tell the Chaucerian Tale from multiple perspectives.  Right down to the hair-splitting squabble between techies and cops in the Command RV, this Tale gets told from multiple solid realities in the fiction.Bravo, Russell Gewirtz, for the wicked good writing.  Bravo to most of the players for taking it up to the next level.Director?  Directors are just there to mastermind camera-sound work and to weed the patch, to keep the right plants growing free.  Spike Lee did his job well, but let's not get too carried away by Directors.  (Admittedly, I did laugh at his choice of American Indian tom-tom music as the cops first sealed up the perimeter around the bank.  And near the end, when the gang is driving everybody out onto the street, the echoing trumpets of Patton's reincarnated self looking out over the North African desert, where he'd fought thousands of years before, is a howler.  Deja vu all over again.  Good job.)BTW, the reviewers who think this is a great bank heist film are full of beans.  Legal centerpiece of the story is the kidnapping of 20-30 people--a capital offense.  When Dalton Russell dropped the diamond into Detective Frazier's pocket, he tipped off the plan.  Frazier could be expected to fess up, turn in the diamond, and crawl through the bank's nooks and crannies until he found the hiding place.  Russell is shown not wearing gloves in the hiding place, or when he crawled out.  His prints--and probably DNA--would've been all over the place.  This year or next, or ten years on, he would've been run down like a dog.  Good guys win.  Bad guys lose.  Even if Frazier is the sort to turn inbetweener, to keep the diamond, and to keep his mouth shut, it's still a surprising storyline hole, coming from legal scholar Gewirtz.--spib, 09 Dec

1003113,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B000GFLKEY,Steve Douglas,"[2, 2]","I won't provide my opinions of the movie or give a long winded summary of the plot.  My reviews only refer to the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray from the initial Standard Definition release which I have.  This will not be a comparison between the two though.The video transfer to blu ray appears to be completely free of any artifacting or banding.  It is a clean transfer with no hint of disturbing grain or aliasing either.  That said, it does appear to have had its color grading adjusted by crushing the blacks.  Therefore, you do lose some of the details in the darker areas.  Skin colors and other color resolutions appear natural and warm in most scenes.  There were a few scenes that had a cooler color grading, particularly in the rooms where the hostages are held. The Blu Ray played normally without any problems at all.The Audio transfer is to a lossless DTS MA 5.1 and it sounds perfectly clear with precisely balanced volumes for both dialogue and ambience.  During the first hour and a half, there is very little use of any of the surround channels and almost everything is coming through your center channel.  When the imagined shootout and police raid on the bank occurs, all of a sudden the audio comes to life with a great deal of directional steering making use of your surrounds, both front and rear, for discreet channeling.  Your LFE channel, at this point, also wakes up for the duration of these scenes.The extras included deleted scenes that, if included, would have made this sometimes ploddingly slow film, even more so.  Usually I prefer deleted scenes to be included in an extended cut but not for this film.

Would you see a night and day difference between it and the Standard Def?

1003114,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B000GFLKEY,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","Good heist movies can be a lot of fun, and Inside Man is one of my favorites. Why is the genre interesting? I think it's because it's fascinating to see a robbery unfold, and the particular method used. In order to keep us interested in what could be a stale topic, modern heist movies have tried to invent new ways to pull off such a crime. Inside Man is one of the most inventive that I have seen.There are countless examples of strong entries in the genre. I'm particularly fond of The Killing, from Stanley Kubrick, which showed us how a robbery might be planned and executed. His use of a narrator was especially effective. Another favorite is Dog Day Afternoon, which is even mentioned in Inside Man. The original version of The Italian Job (1969) focuses on the getaway; Jackie Brown and Heat are more concerned with characters and the method; while more recent efforts, such as Reservoir Dogs and The Town, focus on events after the robbery has taken place.Inside Man falls into the same category as The Killing and Jackie Brown, and it works because the method is so unusual.The story opens with a shot of the gang's leader, Dalton Russell (Owen), advising us to listen closely to what he says. He hints at what is to come, but you might not appreciate the full meaning of his comments until you see the movie a second time. His team dresses as painters and seizes control of a bank, taking around 20 or 30 hostages in the process.The movie doesn't stick to a completely linear structure. Instead, we see some of the former hostages being interviewed by the police after the robbery is over. This choice works well, and we gradually come to understand why Russell's gang made the hostages wear painter's outfits.Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) is called in to negotiate with Russell in order to resolve the situation. Frazier has his own ideas about how things should be handled, and some of his decisions seem risky and unconventional. He's also an intelligent man, and quickly realizes that Russell doesn't expect his demands to be met. So why is he committing the crime?The two other key characters are Arthur Case (Plummer), who owns the bank, and Madeleine White (Foster), who is hired by Case for a specific purpose.I'm not going to reveal any more about the plot because it's best to see it unfold for yourself. Washington and Owen are both excellent choices for their respective roles, and each gives a memorable performance.The movie contains a few twists, and the ultimate resolution is pleasing. I find myself returning to it often, and it always feels fresh. I'm surprised that it hasn't received more critical acclaim.

The movie keeps throwing ""ending"" after ""ending"" at you until you're just ready for it to be over with.  Inside Man is one of these movies.There are some good even great things going on in Inside Man.  As a character and genre study, its amazing.  Screenwriter Russell Gewirtz has fun with the heist film cliches, by creating a situation that's unknown to the viewers until close to the end, and then building a heist film around it.  There is a motive here, hidden and entirely secret that stretches beyond a mere bank robbery much like this film is more than about a heist.  Half of the film's fun comes from confusion and trying to ascertain why the heist is happening, what's going through Clive Owen's Dalton Russell's head.As a character study, it's also interesting.  Not one of the main characters has morals.  Each character has a motive, a desire and not one of them is pristine.  Its nice after seeing her in two women in distress films, that Jodi Foster can bring the cold-hearted and calculated feelings to her character.  The characters are morally ambivalent and, while it can be considered a jaded view of society, but it was interesting seeing conflicted characters who might not be interested in what's right or wrong, but what's good for them.  It might be jaded, but it also is in some ways a good representation of how some things work.Of course there were some indications that this is a Spike Lee film.  Some of his critiques on society are spot on and humorous.  I did take offense with the very minor, but definitely frustrating poke at video games.  Very minor in the film and has nothing to do with it that I hate to bring it up.  But the implication that even these morally ambivalent characters have a problem with a video game (not even an actual game, by the way) was frustrating to me.  Others seemed timely, but stretched.  As an example, the Arab who's really a Sheik and the police saying something to the effect ""Oh my God he's Arab!"" seemed strained.  Timely, interesting, yes, but seemed stilted.Spike Lee also does a great job of introducing minor characters that really help to flesh out the story and provide a backdrop for what's happening.  For instance, the cop who comes on the scene in the beginning and his story of when he first had a gun shoved in his face is interesting.  Needless, maybe, but interesting.  Its just unfortunate that at times, Lee seems more interested in pursuing these little details instead of keeping the film moving.At any rate, its an interesting film that gets bogged down toward the end.  Pacing issues aside, it is a good film that turns some heist conventions on its head while presenting jaded characters who each have a motive and who are very human and real.  It would have been better, though, with a litter tighter script that didn't have to explain every little thing at the end.",4,Pacing keeps it from Great,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2966,"['are', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'think', 'credits', 'should', 'be', 'running', 'anytime', 'now', 'movie', 'throwing', 'ending', 'ending', ""'re"", 'just', 'ready', 'be', 'Inside', 'Man', 'one', 'are', 'good', 'even', 'great', 'things', 'going', 'Inside', 'Man', 'character', 'genre', 'study', 'amazing', 'Screenwriter', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'fun', 'heist', 'film', 'cliches', 'creating', 'situation', 'unknown', 'viewers', 'close', 'end', 'then', 'building', 'heist', 'film', 'motive', 'here', 'hidden', 'entirely', 'secret', 'mere', 'bank', 'robbery', 'much', 'film', 'more', 'heist', 'Half', 'film', 'fun', 'confusion', 'trying', 'ascertain', 'why', 'heist', 'happening', 'what', 'going', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'head.As', 'character', 'study', 'also', 'interesting', 'Not', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'morals', 'character', 'motive', 'desire', 'not', 'one', 'pristine', 'nice', 'seeing', 'two', 'women', 'distress', 'films', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'can', 'bring', 'cold-hearted', 'calculated', 'feelings', 'character', 'characters', 'are', 'morally', 'ambivalent', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'jaded', 'view', 'society', 'was', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'what', 'good', 'might', 'be', 'jaded', 'also', 'ways', 'good', 'representation', 'how', 'things', 'work.Of', 'course', 'were', 'indications', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'critiques', 'society', 'are', 'spot', 'humorous', 'did', 'take', 'offense', 'very', 'minor', 'definitely', 'frustrating', 'poke', 'video', 'games', 'Very', 'minor', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'hate', 'bring', 'up', 'implication', 'even', 'morally', 'ambivalent', 'characters', 'have', 'problem', 'video', 'game', 'not', 'even', 'actual', 'game', 'way', 'was', 'frustrating', 'Others', 'seemed', 'timely', 'stretched', 'example', 'Arab', 'who', 'really', 'Sheik', 'police', 'saying', 'something', 'effect', 'Oh', 'God', 'Arab', 'seemed', 'strained', 'Timely', 'interesting', 'yes', 'seemed', 'stilted.Spike', 'Lee', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'introducing', 'minor', 'characters', 'really', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'provide', 'backdrop', 'what', 'happening', 'instance', 'cop', 'who', 'scene', 'beginning', 'story', 'when', 'first', 'had', 'gun', 'shoved', 'face', 'interesting', 'Needless', 'maybe', 'interesting', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'times', 'Lee', 'more', 'interested', 'pursuing', 'little', 'details', 'instead', 'keeping', 'film', 'rate', 'interesting', 'film', 'bogged', 'down', 'end', 'Pacing', 'issues', 'aside', 'good', 'film', 'heist', 'conventions', 'head', 'presenting', 'jaded', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'motive', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'human', 'real', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'litter', 'tighter', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'explain', 'little', 'thing', 'end']",N/A

I will admit, as many other reviewers have done, that this is probably Spike's best movie since ""Malcom X,"" and, ""Do The Right Thing."" Denzel Washington [who can do no wrong with another stellar performance] teams with Spike Lee again in this highly charged movie that has you guessing from the moment of the classic line, ""This ain't no bank robbery!""Denzel Washington stars as NYPD detective/negotiator, Keith Frazier, who is placed in the difficult situation of a Wall Street bank robbery, where 40+ people are being held hostage by a genius bank robber, Dalton Russel [played by Clive Owen] Russel is the type of movie villian that you can't help but like. He is one determined, cool talking, take no chances man, who even claims to have the perfect bank robbery plan anyone has ever had. Frazier must match wits, brains, and intelligence with Russel in order to save the lives of the people in the bank.There are several scenes such as; Owen and Washington's characters bumping into each other right before the robbery takes place, and the other cops that don't believe Washington's character when he starts to wonder if there is more to this robbery than what it appears, that I found slighly annoying [since I had seen them in many other bank robbing movies]. But those are just minor things probably only myself care about [I can't help myself] and I guarantee you they won't bother the rest of the movie at all.I thought the best scenes were with with Frazier and Russel talking to each other, they seemed to have a war of words and dealings throughout a good portion of the movie.

1003124,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000GFLKEY,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[17, 25]","After watching ""Inside Man"", starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster, I tried to think of something, anything that didn't work. Honestly, I couldn't. ""Inside Man"" is an excellent, enjoyable film.Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and his crew walk into a large bank in the middle of the Manhattan financial district, dressed as painters, and begin to rob the facility. This crew is professional; Russell seems to have thought of everything, down to the infrared lamps to knock out the security cameras. Detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""Dirty Pretty Things"", ""Four Brothers"") are the assigned hostage negotiating team. Frazier has a dark spot on his record, so he is anxious for the opportunity to prove himself. As soon as Mr. Case (Christopher Plummer) hears the news of the hold-up at his bank, he enlists the help of power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster); he needs her help to ensure that something in his bank remains in his bank.""Inside Man"" is a heist film. As soon as you realize that, you know a good example of the genre will be fun, light and breezy, keep you guessing and take you on a bit of a roller coaster ride. Check on all points. ""Inside Man"" is a great example of the genre.I have never been a fan of Spike Lee's films. Film is an art form and the best films engage your imagination, feelings and emotion. Too many of Lee's films (and Oliver Stone's for that matter) bludgeon the viewer over the head with their message. Great films also have a point of view, but Lee's films always seem to portray the ONLY message, according to the filmmaker. If you disagree, screw you.If ""Inside Man"" did not have Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster in it, I probably would not have seen it, because of director Spike Lee. I am glad I did see it because it is an excellent film. All four people are integral to the film's success, but the biggest surprise for me is Spike Lee.Any successful heist film is going to have to move, keep the viewer engaged and provide a form of suspense. Lee clearly recognizes the rules of this type of film and runs with them, playing with them a bit, but keeping them intact. Addressing each of the conventions of this genre, he makes them his own. All of the key points are depicted, and depicted well, leaving no stone unturned. Of course, in a heist film, the stones are unturned when and if the writer and director feel like it. I think he realized he wasn't going to be able to solve the race problems in our society, with this film, and decided to have fun. This is his most mainstream, most commercial film.This is not to say that Lee has gone soft. He incorporates messages and ideas into the framework of this convention. For instance, when a bank employee is released by Dalton, in disguise, the cops approach with caution. When they remove the mask, they reveal he is wearing a turban. One of the cops shouts ""He's an Arab"" and they tackle him to the ground. Later, an exchange between this man and Frazier leads to some telling comments about our country's current paranoia against anyone who appears different and also one of the funniest lines of dialogue I have heard in some time. Another memorable exchange concerns a video game and there are many more instances like this throughout. As the machinations of the heist are in progress, these moments help make the characters more real and the film even more enjoyable.Like the best Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorcese and Woody Allen films, Lee uses New York City as a character. A lot of the crew's plan depends on certain aspects of life in the large metropolis. At one point, Dalton walks right by a bank employee and they only give him a cursory glance. The city's melting pot of personalities and cultures also provides a rich backdrop for the film. Every character has been changed by life in New York and they change the story for good and bad. From cops who immediately set-up crowd barriers to keep the onlookers back, to a cop who is dedicated to his job, but racist due to his interaction with the public, to citizens who expect a little quid pro quo for helping the cops, everyone gives the film a richness sorely lacking from most multiplexes.Denzel Washington's Detective Frazier is one of the actor's most memorable characters. Even with the blight on his record, he is confident, gung ho and ready for the challenge. Arriving at the bank, he meets with Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe), the police officer in charge of tactical operations. Darius is used to working with someone else and immediately discounts Frazier's presence. But the Detective realizes this will not help the situation and quickly establishes his authority. Throughout, he is always thinking, trying to guess Dalton's next move before it happens. He proves very adept at this and equally good dealing with New York.His character has good dialogue throughout, adding an air of levity. When we first meet Frazier, he is discussing his relationship with his girlfriend, in frank and suggestive terms, establishing his character very quickly. Frazier jokes with people throughout, while at the same time is ready to instantly become serious should the need arise, adapting to the changes. When he is interrogating people, this same tactic proves disarming, disorienting people, perhaps allowing some truth to get through.Clive Owen (""Gosford Park"", the unfortunate ""Derailed"") is very good as Dalton Russell, the mastermind behind the robbery. Clearly, Russell has thought through the entire plan, many times, in an attempt to ensure everything goes flawlessly. Dalton frequently seems tired of, or perhaps resigned to, dealing with less, intelligent people. He seems to treat people with slight scorn, deriding them because they are less intelligent.Dalton is always clear and calculating. Through most of the film, he even appears to be more ruthless than you might think, adding an unexpected element to the heist. The film is also good about casting doubts on his character a few times; we begin to wonder if he has, in fact, thought of everything.Jodie Foster's Madeline White is, essentially, a supporting character, but no less memorable. As a high powered power broker, Madeline thinks everyone is beneath her, including her clients for needing her in the first place. But that doesn't stop her from working for them, and extracting huge fees. The great thing about Madeline is that even though she is a powerful woman and disliked by everyone she meets, she recognizes this and doesn't care. She knows that everyone she meets; from the Detective, to the Mayor, to Mr. Case, to Dalton Russell, everyone no matter how small, will one day be a person who can help her make new clients, settle new business, and create new favors.""Inside Man"" is the best film I have seen so far this year. If Spike Lee continues to direct films like this, I might even become a fan and eagerly anticipate his new films.",5,"""Inside"" a Great Genre Film",1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,6961,"['watching',

There's no surprise ending and there's nothing fascinating about this so-called "" thriller"". With that said , I am about to vent because this was an unexpected lemon. Secondly, I am a huge Denzel Washington fan and a huge Spike Lee fan. I've always enjoyed Willem Defoe , Christopher Plummer , and Jody Foster. All of these talents are immeasurable and can do wonders with good material. Problem with Spike Lee's latest film, about a New York city crisis negotiator who is dealing with a bank robbery and hostage situation, entitled  "" Inside Man "" , is that this material isn't even good enough to be called mediocre. Certainly the actors have done what they could with what they had to work with. It's painful to see talented actors reaching for more emotion to get anything out of a boring scene. Ultimately , I believe that this is a project that takes the normally focused Spike Lee , out of his genre and element. With hits like ""School Daze"" , ""Jungle Fever"" , ""Do The Right Thing"" , and ""Malcom X "" , Lee , burst onto the film scene with a visionary skill that noone could imitate. However , "" Inside Man"" just played out like a bad melodramatic soap opera. This film is exempliary of poor filmaking choices. Spike Lee is a visionary director with a focal point in all of his films. Without a focus , everything else is blurry nonsense. Not even the acting strengths of Denzel Washington  and the stellar cast can save this lemon , of a film. Then again, if Spike Lee intended on filming a movie and proving that he can also direct forgettable and generic productions , he's done a fabulous job. However , Spike Lee is better and smarter than "" Inside Man "". Hopefully , he'll re-recognized the power of his gift and I look forward to seeing his upcoming HBO documentary, about the devastating issues in New Orleans, entitled , "" When the Levees Broke "". The best aspect of this DVD is the behind-the-scenes footage. The interview between Denzel Washington and Spike Lee is revealing and provides glimses of their admiration for one another and their genuine friendship. Too bad this segment lasts for less than ten minutes. Lesson to learn ? Yes , beware of any film that has alot of big named actors on the cover. The producers do this to enduce the viewer to buy it because the cover is appealing. Usually to hide the stench inside. In this case , a useless and boring film. Bottom line , if you're a fan of anyone connected to this film.....be afraid.

I felt Spike Lee's message was becoming just like all his other movies.  I admit, when I saw Spike Lee's name on the movie, I knew right there it would be much of the same.  But, in all do fairness, I decided to give it a chance.  I should've went with my first instinct.The cast was fantastic, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington, these are ""heavy-hitters"" in the movies.

And it isn't.The hostages change into the same outfits that the bad guys are wearing, thus making them all look alike.  You see flash forward interviews of the hostages in people in police custody, with the cops trying to trip them up to figure out who the thieves are.The acting is fine all around, but there are no knockout performances that will be remembered  at Oscar nomination time.  Christopher Plummer plays the paranoid bank president, with a deep, dark secret to hide.  He enlists of the help of a mysterious power broker played by Jodie Foster, to protect his secret.  You just don't get a sense that her character really had a chance to use exercise her  power, and thus give us more insight into who she is and what she can do.Clive Owen seems cool, calm and in control as the lead bagd guy.  There are clues throughout the film about how things will unfold with this character, but you're supposed to just mentally file them away since they don't give you any ""a-ha"" moments when you see them. If you see something that doesn't seem to add to the story, pay attention.The dialogue contains references to race relations - always a Spike Lee favorite.  If you're expecting fast-paced action, you'll be disappointed.  Does it deliver as a smart ""conspiracy"" film?  Heil, no!The Inside Man is supposed to be more about a morally bankrupt past than it is about a bank robbery.  However, I found this film to be under whelming and unsatisfying.  It's tries to be a clever story, but it wasn't sharp enough for me.  It's lacks a really meaty story.  The film tries to appeal to your head by being an intelligent thriller but Lee forgot to add in the ""thriller"" part.  By the way, you'll know you're watching a Spike Lee film when you see Denzel Washington's character running down the street but in reality, just standing on a rapidly moving platform.

1003132,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000GFLKEY,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Spike Lee's `Inside Man' centers around a bank robbery in Manhattan, but if you are looking forward to seeing shoot-outs or explosions, you will be hugely disappointed. Lee's film is not about them; in spite of the hostage situation, it is more like a con-game done between three players - Denzel Washington's police detective, Clive Owen's bank robber, and Jodie Foster's mysterious female who represents the interest of one person.To reveal much about the story will only lessen the fun you will get while watching cleverly constructed `Inside Man.' I only say this; the film deals with a `perfect crime' scenario. At the beginning of the film, in some dark place like a prison cell, one Dalton Russell, Clive Owen's enigmatic mastermind, tells you about his idea about perfect crime. He knows how to do it, and he means it.The film gradually reveals the true meaning of his words, showing how the four robbers led by Dalton hit the bank and take hostage. Denzel Washington's detective Keith Fraizer hurries to the crime scene as hostage negotiator, but he is not the only one who is interested in the situation, as Mayor of NYC also arrives, and strongly suggests that an ace `fixer' Madeleine White (played by delightfully polite and ice-cold Jodie Foster) should remain there and give a `help' or two to solve some problems.[PLOT HOLES] I said the film is `clever,' but that doesn't mean the film's script by first-time writer Russell Gewirtz is free from plot holes. I said clever because it succeeds, almost if not perfectly, in covering up the numerous holes in the implausible plot with a taut storytelling of Lee, and the powerhouse acting from the three leads and the good supports such as Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.You know, no `clever' robbers would take hostages; in `Inside Man,' however, there is a good reason for the robbers to take hostages, but the reason itself is, if you think about it rationally, highly unlikely. But the film's story remains still entertaining all the same, not by just following the story, but by showing the complexity of the characters. That's why `Inside Man' is most intriguing when it reflects the racial diversity of the city and the country, for example, in the scene where the police get panicky after seeing a man wearing a turban.But the main attraction of `Inside Man' is its skillful storytelling greatly helped by the top-notch cast. Not that the plot is totally unpredictable for some of you will be able to anticipate the twists in the plot. Moreover, we all know that Jodie's Foster's lawyer (or whatever she is) is only possible because of her good acting. We all know that no one is allowed to behave like her while a serious hostage situation is going on. But like any other good films about the perfect crimes, `Inside Man' requires suspension of disbelief, and much of it, and perhaps it is aware of its defect when it briefly refers to the films like `Serpico' and `Dog Day Afternoon' much more realistic version of police and heist in New York. Still `Inside Man is a very entertaining film as long as you can ignore certain elements in its very convoluted story.",4,(3.5 STARS) Spike Lee's Highly Entertaining Heist Film (if You Can Ignore the Numerous Plot Holes),1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,3159,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'Man', 'centers', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Manhattan', 'are', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'shoot-outs', 'explosions', 'will', 'be', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'Lee', 'film', 'not', 'spite', 'hostage', 'situation', 'more', 'con-game', 'done', 'three', 'players', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'police', 'detective', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'bank', 'robber', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'mysterious', 'female', 'who', 'interest', 'one', 'person.To', 'reveal', 'much', 'story', 'will', 'only', 'lessen', 'fun', 'will', 'get', 'watching', 'cleverly', 'constructed', 'Inside', 'Man', 'only', 'say', 'film', 'deals', 'perfect', 'crime', 'scenario', 'beginning', 'film', 'dark', 'place', 'prison', 'cell', 'one', 'Dalton', 'Russell', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'enigmatic', 'mastermind', 'idea', 'perfect', 'crime', 'how', 'do', 'it.The', 'film', 'gradually', 'true', 'meaning', 'words', 'showing', 'how', 'four', 'robbers', 'led', 'Dalton', 'hit', 'bank', 'take', 'hostage', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'detective', 'Keith', 'Fraizer', 'hurries', 'crime', 'scene', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'interested', 'situation', 'Mayor', 'NYC', 'also', 'strongly', 'ace', 'fixer', 'Madeleine', 'White', 'played', 'delightfully', 'polite', 'ice-cold', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'should', 'remain', 'there', 'give', 'help', 'two', 'solve', 'problems', '[', 'PLOT', 'HOLES', ']', 'said', 'film', 'clever', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'script', 'first-time', 'writer', 'Russell', 'Gewirtz', 'free', 'plot', 'holes', 'said', 'clever', 'almost', 'not', 'perfectly', 'covering', 'up', 'numerous', 'holes', 'implausible', 'plot', 'taut', 'storytelling', 'Lee', 'powerhouse', 'acting', 'three', 'leads', 'good', 'supports', 'such', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor.You', 'know', 'clever', 'robbers', 'would', 'take', 'hostages', 'Man', 'however', 'good', 'reason', 'robbers', 'take', 'hostages', 'reason', 'think', 'rationally', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'film', 'story', 'still', 'entertaining', 'same', 'not', 'just', 'following', 'story', 'showing', 'complexity', 'characters', 'why', 'Man', 'most', 'intriguing', 'when', 'racial', 'diversity', 'city', 'country', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'police', 'get', 'panicky', 'seeing', 'man', 'wearing', 'turban.But', 'main', 'attraction', 'Man', 'skillful', 'storytelling', 'greatly', 'helped', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'Not', 'plot', 'totally', 'unpredictable', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'anticipate', 'twists', 'plot', 'Moreover', 'know', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'lawyer', 'only', 'possible', 'good', 'acting', 'know', 'one', 'allowed', 'behave', 'serious', 'hostage', 'situation', 'going', 'other', 'good', 'films', 'perfect', 'crimes', 'Man', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'much', 'perhaps', 'aware', 'defect', 'when', 'refers', 'films', 'Serpico', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'version', 'police', 'heist', 'New', 'York', 'Still', 'Man', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'ignore', 'certain', 'elements', 'very', 'convoluted', 'story']",N/A

The who, what, when, where, and why are questions that everyone already knows the answers to. What people don't know is the how. The movie then illustrates just how Russell was able to complete his master heist.Russell and his gang begin their caper by entering a premier bank in New York posing as painters. They shine lights at the cameras, lock the doors, reveal their weapons, and announce that a robbery is in progress. Confusion mounts as the robbers dress those in the bank in identical costumes. Along the way, a game of wits is played between Russell and Det. Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). Frazier knows Russell is up to something but he just can't figure out what. Hired into the game by the owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), is independent &#34;fixer&#34; Madeline White (Jodie Foster). White's presence seems unnecessary for most of the movie, but she adds a wild card into the whole scenario that cannot be ignored. The fun part is trying to figure out just how it's all going to play out in the end and how Russell is able to escape with a fortune, but no stolen money and without being caught.INSIDE MAN has a great cast with some fabulous acting. Washington, Foster, and Plummer are magnificent as always, but stronger performances are given by some of the film's supporting actors, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor as Frazier's assistant Bill Mitchell and Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh hostage who when released from the bank is at first thought to be a terrorist.For a heist picture, INSIDE MAN moves rather slowly. Yet, at the slower pace the movie never really drags. Also, scattered throughout the movie are moments of social commentary-such as when Russell speaks with a young boy in the bank during the heist about the hand held video game he is playing. Beside the commentary, these moments also provide greater depth to the characters we see on the screen.Overall, INSIDE MAN is an enjoyable heist picture. It's a movie that a wide audience can relate to.

The plot sounded interesting, with ample chance for rich story and character elements. I came out more disappointed than in any movie in years. A borrowed ""bank heist"" premise and a few gritty, stylized, or eccentric touches and small-scale human-nature observations do not add up to a good movie. This is true no matter how talented, intelligent, and otherwise successful the people involved. I cannot join in a chorus of empty praise for what is so clearly a failed film.The storytelling was slow-paced, uneven, disorganized, and uninspired. Long before the film finally dragged to an end and revealed the secret of the heist, I had stopped caring. When the drawn-out movie was not belaboring dense details that did not add up to anything larger, it was veering into thin, superficial subplots -- ones that were either boring or far-fetched and sensationalistic -- with even more superficial characters, dialogue, and interactions.None of the characters were worth caring about or had any depth. They were mere stick-figure plot devices. I have never seen Denzel Washington look bad until this film, or play a less coherent, less impressive character. Other characters were cardboard villains, perhaps with some shock-value traits pasted on for effect, even down to the gray-haired establishment type who appeared briefly to spew obscenities every other word. Jodie Foster made an interesting ice-cold, high-society ""fixer,"" and Clive Owen a smooth, cool, wily robber, but their thin, flat characters were mere injected devices for unbelievable actions and story lines.  Despite their talents, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer were able to add nothing, with stiff performances in empty roles.  An air of pseudo-sophistication threw a wet blanket on all of the performances.As a commentary on society or human nature, the film's observations seem trivial. As a crime drama, the police work could not have been less impressive or the dramatic presentation less suspenseful. The rushed attempt toward the end to tie together plot threads, finally create some dramatic momentum, and belatedly manufacture heroics was confusing, contrived, unrealistic, out-of-place, and ineffective.Quite frankly, the disparate elements of this uneven film did not come together to tell a meaningful or entertaining story on any level. It was a major disappointment.

I've seen Courage Under Fire, Crimson Tide, and Man on Fire at least a dozen times each.  My friends told me to go see Inside Man when it was out at the theaters, but I opted to wait till it came out on DVD.  I just couldn't imagine Spike Lee doing a good thriller.  Then, I waited a little longer.  I finally bought the movie and watched it a little while ago.  All I can say is that I was really impressed by the whole shebang.  Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier was his usual great self.  Clive Owen (I do wish he'd taken the ""James Bond"" role) as the criminal mastermind, Dalton Russell, proved equal in matching Denzel's smooth and rich performance within this taut cat-and-mouth suspense thriller.  Jody Foster as the mysterious Madeline White was beautiful, sexy, and oh so sassy in a role that begs for a movie about this intriguing character.  The plot, as most readers are now aware of, involves the robbery of a Manhattan bank and what happens when the police show up.  At first, it seems like your typical bank robbery with the hostages being negotiated for a plane so that the criminals can escape, etc., etc.  But, there's something else going on here, and the glues are revealed one at a time, keeping the viewer guessing as to what's going to happen next.  The big question, of course, is whether or not Clive Owen and his crew escape; and, if so, how do they get out of the bank without the police catching them?  Next is how do Christopher Plummer and Jodie Foster figure into all of this?  What are their agendas?  Is Denzel Washington's character the ""inside man""?  Is Denzel's character a good cop or a bad cop?  The movie is over two hours in length, but it plays much faster.  In fact, it seems to be over so quickly that you find yourself wishing for more interaction between Denzel and Clive Owen.  It's wonderful watching these two excellent actors play off of each other.  In fact, it's almost mesmerizing to watch.  Also, I don't know what Jodie Foster has done recently to change her appearance, but she seems to be getting more beautiful with age.  Though the Inside Man is more of a character-driven movie than an action film, it certainly fulfilled both roles for me and demonstrated rather clearly that Spike Lee is capable of doing anything he puts his mind to in Hollywood.  I will admit that there was a lose end that came to mind once the movie was over with (how did Clive Owen's character know about safety deposit box 392 and what was inside of it?), but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film.  This was an utterly suspenseful movie with a brilliant script from a first-time screenwriter, top-notch direction from Mr. Lee, and perfect performances from some of today's most talented actors.  The extras include twenty-five minutes of deleted scenes, a fifteen-minute look at the Making of Inside Man, and a movie commentary by the director.

1003144,AP3B615GM191G,B000GFLKEY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","""Inside Man"" is one of those movies that is hard to pin a ranking too.  On one hand, it is an absolute blast to watch and let the mystery unravel.  On the other hand, it pretty much does exactly that (""unravel"") in the end.For a basic plot summary, this film sees Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and a crew of henchmen stage a bank robbery.  Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is quickly called to the scene, only to slowly begin piecing together the notion that perhaps Russell has very different plans for the hostage scenario.""Inside Man"" grabs your interest right away and always keeps you guessing.  Just when you think you might have a handle on what is going on, it throws you another curveball to keep you on the edge of your seat.  As the mysteries continue to deepen, you'll become completely invested in just what the heck Dalton Russell is planning!This is also one of the best Denzel Washington performances ever put to film (and that is saying something).  His chemistry with Owen produces some chilling scenes that only heighten the mystery/tension climate of the movie.Here's what keeps this movie from becoming a true classic, though (mild spoilers ahead): It truly is all about the build-up...the resolution really falls flat.  ""Inside Man"" is squarely one of those films where the journey is far, far more fun than the actual destination.Though 4.5 stars would be ideal for this flick, I bump it up to five because it was just so darn fun to get hooked into the acting/mysteries of the overall experience.
