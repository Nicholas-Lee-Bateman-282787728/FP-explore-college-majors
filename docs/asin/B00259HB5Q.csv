Most (but not all) of my friends and I quickly became Frazier fans because of Ali's mouth.  He was too flashy and Hollywood and full of himself.  Frazier was blue-collar working-class like us.  All business.  And he could take any punch that Ali gave him.  Not many men could do that.And this fight...it is without question the greatest sporting event I've ever seen.This documentary tells the story of their rivalry in a way I've never seen.  It gives all the background leading up to the fight -- and why these guys almost killed each other in Manila.  Some might say this documentary is basically an expose on what a scumbag Cassius Clay is.I also understand now why Joe Frazier has never forgiven Cassius Clay for all the things he said publicly about Joe back in those days.  It's because Cassius Clay has never been man enough to apologize to Joe's face, man to man.  You don't apologize to a man like Joe Frazier through a newspaper article.  You don't apologize for doing the things Ali did without apologizing in person, face to face, man to man.

I enjoyed this one much more since it brought so much to light.  It was a documentary that covered both sides of the story and Joe Frazier was not reduced to something of an extreme secondary figure.  The rivalry and the hyperbole was presented and analyzed now with a perspective not done before.  I was surprised how Ferdie Pacheco came off in this.  He seemed to take umbrage for no apparent reason. Perhaps defensive of his friend, Ali.  I had been used to the erudite color commentator of cable television, I expected something insightful from him.  He was downright dismissive. He came off as just another guy in Ali's camp, time had lent no perspective for him.A courageous documentary since most films and documentaries featuring Ali, tend to be tributes and never a critique is made.  This documentary makes some salient points, and brings aspect on this rivalry only made on Mark Kram's excellet book ""Ghosts of Manila"", which also made points and critiques that provoked many. So be it.  Not all can be tributes and no one is above critique.The fight itself was well analyzed.  I had seen this on HBO and wanted to and did purchase it.  I have a number of sport documentaries and this one rates right up there.  The candid interviews.  Marvis Frazier's interviews were quite entertaining,  I especially enjoyed his imitation of Howard Cosell.  The varying opinions and analysis by sports reporters, their analysis and observations.

How much of Ali's fight build up chatter throughout his career was to feed the press and make his fights much more known and a  much better pay day...and how many of his comments were serious attacks...we may never know. I've never seen a grown man whine so much about being  called a ""gorilla"" as much as Frazier and his friends  and family do in this documentary.  Joe Frazier should shut his complaining  mouth  and accept  that  without Ali he'd be Larry Holmes. If you visit his website its  adorned with pictures of him and Ali most of  them the ""punch"" that sent  Ali  down in their first fight...and he has multiple versions  of it for sale ,  signed for hundreds  of dollars....without Ali  and the controversy he complains about over and over he'd be a forgotten name in a history book..oh and the pictures of himself signed ..without ALI sell for 3 times LESS...so I guess Joe knows the truth doesn't he?Make  no mistake...I like Smokin Joe and thought he was a class act before his participation  in this  rewriting  of history. With a bit of editing and a perspective of the documentary film maker  you can present any position you like and I guess they still want to cash in on the magic that is and always will be ""Ali"" but figure making him a racist devil and  as they do a member of an organization similar to the KKK...(they do believe me)...its another way to get money off him.The idea that Ali is suffering in his life now due to past treatment of Frazier is beyond belief and what does that say about Frazier's own feeling of importance that God would somehow punish another man for calling him a ""tom"" or ""Gorilla""? Ali should have quit after this fight and Frazier should have as well...they both took too many hits to the head and in this fight in far too dehydrated a state with the brain less protected...The only reason I give it 2 stars is for the extra footage to add to my library.  This is a great example of documentary perspective...and while Ali the saint might be too far in the opposite direction, I'm aware of enough other accounts  and perspectives to appreciate this re-imagining of the past as perhaps  the only new  way to mine the legend..it isn't the first place  I'd go to enjoy this bit of history and certainly not  definitive.",2,One sided history of a great fight and rivalry....I'm  not  persuaded.,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,3069,"['Get', 'off', 'cross', 'Joe', 'mid', '50', 'when', 'writing', 'very', 'good', 'autobiography', 'have', 'read', 'Joe', 'still', 'refused', 'even', 'refer', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'anything', 'other', 'CLAY', 'so', 'go', 'there', 'when', 'watch', 'Joe', 'moan', 'being', 'called', 'Gorilla', 'talk', 'disprespect', 'Ali', 'said', 'Clay', 'was', 'slave', 'name', 'took', 'decades', 'earlier', 'Joe', 'disrespect', 'then', 'cry', 'being', 'called', 'Tom', 'truly', '2', 'faced', 'like', 'Joe', 'love', 'work', 'ethic', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'movie.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'being', 'ALI', 'days', 'lost', 'voice', 'literally', 'so', 'movie', 'Facing', 'Ali', 'due', 'soon', 'documentary', 'people', 'involved', 'history', 'are', 'speaking', 'got', 'voice', 'How', 'much', 'Ali', 'fight', 'build', 'up', 'chatter', 'career', 'was', 'feed', 'press', 'make', 'fights', 'much', 'more', 'known', 'much', 'better', 'pay', 'day', 'how', 'many', 'comments', 'were', 'serious', 'attacks', 'may', 'never', 'know', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'grown', 'man', 'whine', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'called', 'gorilla', 'as', 'much', 'Frazier', 'friends', 'family', 'do', 'documentary', 'Joe', 'Frazier', 'should', 'shut', 'complaining', 'mouth', 'accept', 'Ali', ""'d"", 'be', 'Larry', 'Holmes', 'visit', 'website', 'adorned', 'pictures', 'Ali', 'most', 'punch', 'sent', 'Ali', 'down', 'first', 'fight', 'multiple', 'versions', 'sale', 'signed', 'hundreds', 'dollars', '.without', 'Ali', 'controversy', ""'d"", 'be', 'forgotten', 'name', 'history', 'book..oh', 'pictures', 'signed', '..without', 'ALI', 'sell', '3', 'times', 'LESS', 'so', 'guess', 'Joe', 'truth', ""n't"", 'Make', 'mistake', 'like', 'Smokin', 'Joe', 'thought', 'was', 'class', 'act', 'participation', 'rewriting', 'history', 'bit', 'editing', 'perspective', 'documentary', 'film', 'maker', 'can', 'present', 'position', 'guess', 'still', 'want', 'cash', 'magic', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'Ali', 'figure', 'making', 'racist', 'devil', 'do', 'member', 'organization', 'similar', 'KKK', 'do', 'believe', 'way', 'get', 'money', 'him.The', 'idea', 'Ali', 'suffering', 'life', 'now', 'due', 'past', 'treatment', 'Frazier', 'belief', 'what', 'say', 'Frazier', 'own', 'feeling', 'importance', 'God', 'would', 'somehow', 'punish', 'man', 'calling', 'tom', 'Gorilla', 'Ali', 'should', 'have', 'quit', 'fight', 'Frazier', 'should', 'have', 'as', 'well', 'took', 'too', 'many', 'hits', 'head', 'fight', 'far', 'too', 'dehydrated', 'state', 'brain', 'protected', 'only', 'reason', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'extra', 'footage', 'add', 'library', 'great', 'example', 'documentary', 'perspective', 'Ali', 'saint', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'far', 'opposite', 'direction', ""'m"", 'aware', 'enough', 'other', 'accounts', 'perspectives', 'appreciate', 're-imagining', 'past', 'perhaps', 'only', 'new', 'way', 'mine', 'legend..it', ""n't"", 'first', 'place', ""'d"", 'go', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'history', 'certainly', 'not', 'definitive']",N/A
1250468,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B00259HB5Q,trashcanman,"[12, 19]","Muhammad Ali is not only the greatest and most important boxer in history, he is the greatest figure in all of sports.  His brazen outspoken politics, his intelligence, his wild sense of humor, a style of fighting so proficient that Bruce Lee drew inspiration from it, and most of all his willingness to go to jail and be stripped of his title and career for his personal beliefs against the Vietnam War. His legendary pre-fight antics were simply the most entertaining thing ever to happen in the world of professional sports. However you choose to look at it, Ali is The Greatest.  In my opinion, the measure of a man and good sportmanship is not what is said and done prior to or even during a competition, but after.  Towards the end of this recent documentary chronicling every angle of the most epic confrontation in the history of boxing, Joe Frazier's brother dials the ex-champ's voicemail for the camera to hear.  Frazier's jovial voice says ""My name is Smokin' Joe Frazier. Sharp as a razor. Yeah. Floating like a butterfly, stings like a bee. I'm the man that done the job. He knows, look and see. Call me. Bye, bye.''  Nearly 35 years after the fact, Frazier is still so defined by that fight and angry at his rival that his recorded cell phone greeting mockingly gloats that he is the reason Muhammad Ali now suffers from advanced Parkinson's Disease.  That is just amazing to me.  Frazier has gone on record many times over the years as saying that Ali has been punished by God for everything from his religious choices (Ali is a Muslim, Frazier a Baptist) to the admittedly brutal and over-the-top insults The Greatest made during their classic rivalry.  As a result, I've long held a strong dislike of Frazier.  But this documentary does an amazing job at summing up the champ's feelings and getting his half of the story out there.  This is the best sports documentary ever made in my opinion and even non-boxing fans will likely be amazed and get the hype about The Thrilla in Manila that continues to this very day when they see it.Looking at the sum of the events as chronicled in this doc, it's really amazing just how things played out.  This particular telling of the story we've all heard or read in some form or another does a great job telling the humble story of one of the greatest boxers to ever live who has been relegated to being known as ""the guy who fought Ali"" while his poorly-mannered opponent gained immortality, acclaim, and blatant worship around the globe.  While there are plenty of clips of Ali doing his thing here, most of the interviews are from Frazier's family and trainers and his side of the story is fleshed out better the I'd ever seen.  Ali indeed pushed the envelope further with Frazier then he ever had before, utilizing racial insults like Uncle Tom and regularly calling Smokin' Joe a gorilla.  I'll admit to laughing myself sick at the image of Ali clutching a small gorilla doll in one hand while rapidly punching it with the other as a prediction of the fight, but I don't think anybody would say it was a classy thing to do.  The fact that the champ had personally taken Ali under his wing while he was barred from boxing didn't make Ali look too good either.  And what Ali may not have realized was that the power his racial attacks on his opponent and assurances that Frazier worked for ""the enemy"" of black people in that time period led to Frazier's children being beaten up at school for having a perceived race traitor for a father.  Things like that really put into perspective why the fight became so personal.  Ali was a spectacularly funny man, but with the amount of influence he carried at that point in time one does wish he had chosen his words more carefully.  And there are allegations in this doc from both camps that the words were not even Ali's own, but fed to him by the militant segregationist Nation of Islam.  In one shocking moment, Ali recounts a speech he gave IN FRONT OF THE KU KLUX KLAN suggesting cooperation to eliminate interracial breeding.  That really threw me for a loop.  My personal hero throwing in with The Klan?  If you'd told me that, I'd have called you a liar, but there it is.  Forgotten moments like that are what make this documentary so amazing.Professional boxing may have become stale and dull in recent years, but it's storied history will remain forever enthralling. Seeing Muhammad Ali in action will always be a thing of beauty, and the amazing outcome of a fight so brutal it essentially ended his career as The Greatest because he simply never recovered from the punishment he took over 14 rounds at Frazier's hands will always be talked about.  Ali has recanted several times the statements made about Joe Frazier as having been purely for entertainment, but there is no forgiveness.  Smokin' Joe is as bitter today as he was three decades ago and delights in the notion that his opponent's degenerative suffering could be his handiwork.  You couldn't write a more compelling story then the history between these two all-time greats.  This documentary is the most complete retrospective of what will always be the greatest fight of all time and whether you are a fan of boxing, Joe Frazier, or Muhammad Ali or you just want to see what all the fuss is about, you will have a great time watching this movie.",5,The definitive account of the greatest fight of all time.,1250294400,"08 15, 2009",2009,5327,"['Muhammad', 'Ali', 'not',
