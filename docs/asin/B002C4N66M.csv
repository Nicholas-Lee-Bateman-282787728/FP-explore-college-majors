A short appearance by the icon Cynthia Myers as a prostitute (natch) really made me wish the video was sharper.

1261991,AECVYXIL9791R,B002C4N66M,David C. Read,"[20, 21]","This undistinguished oater is made much worse by technical problems.  It isn't a bad little western, and the two lead roles are played competently by Vera Miles, whose most famous role was Laurie Jorgensen in ""The Searchers,"" and Sam Elliott, who was born to make westerns.  It had a good plot and some beautiful desert locations.Unfortunately, the film was not well shot.  None--and I mean not one--of the interior scenes is adequately lighted; you can barely make out dark shadows moving around against a black background.  The scenes in the Cactus Jail, which are key and set up the movie, might as well be taking place in a cave without even a candle for light.  Then there's the DVD which is full-frame and was mastered from an extremely distressed print of the film.  The DVD is blurry and shows every scratch, spot, and speck of dirt that 33 years of obscurity could inflict on the print.  Too bad.  Miles and Elliott deserved better.  Frankly, because of the technical issues, the film is probably not worth wasting 90 minutes on.",2,Technical problems render this oater virtually unwatchable,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,1038,"['undistinguished', 'oater', 'made', 'much', 'worse', 'technical', 'problems', ""n't"", 'bad', 'little', 'western', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'competently', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'was', 'Laurie', 'Jorgensen', 'Searchers', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'make', 'westerns', 'had', 'good', 'plot', 'beautiful', 'desert', 'locations.Unfortunately', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'shot', 'None', 'mean', 'not', 'one', 'interior', 'scenes', 'adequately', 'lighted', 'can', 'barely', 'make', 'out', 'dark', 'shadows', 'moving', 'around', 'black', 'background', 'scenes', 'Cactus', 'Jail', 'are', 'key', 'set', 'up', 'movie', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'cave', 'even', 'candle', 'light', 'Then', 'DVD', 'full-frame', 'was', 'mastered', 'extremely', 'distressed', 'print', 'film', 'DVD', 'blurry', 'scratch', 'spot', 'speck', 'dirt', '33', 'years', 'obscurity', 'could', 'inflict', 'print', 'Too', 'bad', 'Miles', 'Elliott', 'deserved', 'better', 'Frankly', 'technical', 'issues', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'worth', 'wasting', '90', 'minutes']",Molly and Lawless John

He was excellent in it along with Vera Miles.  The movie was very entertaining and even humorous.  It never disappoints especially if you enjoy old Saturday morning type Westerns from the 70's.,5,Funny old movie,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,329,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'surprising', 'see', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'earlier', 'film', 'was', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'know', 'was', 'excellent', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'even', 'humorous', 'never', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'old', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'type', 'Westerns', '70']",Molly and Lawless John

It's no big deal really, but the cover might be a bit misleading. Without his mustache I thought he looked more like Tom Cruise than Sam Elliott. Maybe it's because he was so young.Either way this movie is really good. Someone should remake it though. Time has not been kind to it and the picture and sound are not the best. Still, if you're a fan of Elliott and his Westerns this should definitely be in your collection. By reading the synopsis I believed this flick to be more on the romantic side. Quite the contrary.
