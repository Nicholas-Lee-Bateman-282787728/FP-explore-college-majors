I mean, hey I got all night long to watch this movie!  Why cut the songs off half way through!!!!????????I GUARANTEE you people, this is fun to watch the first time then COLLECTS DUST! Had they included FULL Versions of the Songs, it would be fun to re-watch anytime! The ""Beatles Anthology"" to me is a masterpiece, they didnt give a crap if it was 8 hours, why doesn't this film do the same thing!You want to watch a movie of Rush gabbing about their songs, ok then , this is great, you want to see a song play out and see the videos of Tom Sawyer and Early Distant Warning, or a live shot of YYZ, then this ISNT'T For you!To the producers of this film: Go back and put the songs in full length, add a few more songs and videos in, then come back with a 4 hour movie and I'll rave all over it and give it 5 stars and say it's the best ever!Ok....next subject.I did like the interviews, many things tho either time has changed them or the truth was never told.Examples...1) Geddy Lee said in earlier interviews that John Rutsy left on his own, this movie says they made him quit for health reasons and he took it hard....which is right?2) Terry Brown who produced all Rush up to Signals, the original story years back was HE wanted to quit and Rush took the news so bad they almost quit but found a new producer. This movie states that Rush basically fired Terry and wanted new blood in the productions.  who knows which story is right.PS---To all you boneheads you rip me apart for giving this 3 stars, Oh excuse me! 3 out of 5 isnt bad, it's a B- score. I am MORE A RUSH FAN THAN YOU ARE because I want MORE, I want the whole songs...for that you run me down....LOL!",3,SHOUDA BEEN BETTER....I always Loved RUSH !,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,1781,"['One', 'thing', 'Rock', 'films', 'always', 'piss', 'off', 'always', 'seemed', 'Rush', 'pun', 'intended', 'audience', 'mean', 'hey', 'got', 'night', 'long', 'watch', 'movie', 'Why', 'cut', 'songs', 'way', 'GUARANTEE', 'people', 'fun', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'COLLECTS', 'DUST', 'Had', 'included', 'FULL', 'Versions', 'Songs', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 're-watch', 'anytime', 'Beatles', 'Anthology', 'masterpiece', 'didnt', 'give', 'crap', 'was', '8', 'hours', 'why', ""n't"", 'film', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'Rush', 'gabbing', 'songs', 'ok', 'then', 'great', 'want', 'see', 'song', 'play', 'out', 'see', 'videos', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Early', 'Distant', 'Warning', 'live', 'shot', 'YYZ', 'then', ""ISNT'T"", 'producers', 'film', 'Go', 'back', 'put', 'songs', 'full', 'length', 'add', 'few', 'more', 'songs', 'videos', 'then', 'come', 'back', '4', 'hour', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'rave', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'say', 'best', 'ever', 'Ok', '.next', 'subject.I', 'did', 'interviews', 'many', 'things', 'tho', 'time', 'changed', 'truth', 'was', 'never', 'told.Examples', '1', 'Geddy', 'Lee', 'said', 'earlier', 'interviews', 'John', 'Rutsy', 'left', 'own', 'movie', 'made', 'quit', 'health', 'reasons', 'took', 'hard', '.which', 'right', '2', 'Terry', 'Brown', 'who', 'produced', 'Rush', 'up', 'Signals', 'original', 'story', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'HE', 'wanted', 'quit', 'Rush', 'took', 'news', 'so', 'bad', 'almost', 'quit', 'found', 'new', 'producer', 'movie', 'Rush', 'basically', 'fired', 'Terry', 'wanted', 'new', 'blood', 'productions', 'who', 'story', 'right.PS', '-To', 'boneheads', 'rip', 'apart', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'Oh', '3', '5', 'isnt', 'bad', 'B-', 'score', 'am', 'MORE', 'RUSH', 'FAN', 'THAN', 'ARE', 'want', 'MORE', 'want', 'whole', 'songs', 'run', 'down', '.LOL']",Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage

I have found the great equalizer.  Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage lets you in to almost every dirty little secret you would ever want to know about ""The Stooges"" told by the boys themselves.Some of the highlights include:- Rush playing to a bunch of preteens who smile politely and clap while secretly asking themselves WTF is up with this band?- What were the boys doing in their hotel rooms during their tour with Kiss while Gene Simmons was bedding everthing with two legs?- What were the boys smoking when they made Caress of Steel?- How the Band got their break because some program director in Cleveland was searching for a track to play while her DJ's answered the call of nature.- How the professor went from an International Harvester Tractor Parts Manager to one of the greatest drummers ever to grace the planet.- Laugh while you watch a pimply faced Alex Lifeson try to justify to his parents why he should quit high school and skip ""University"" because he DOESN'T want to drive around in a big car and make lots of money...(good one Alex...I'll help you take some of that evil moola off your hands).- See the boys in their ridiculous Kimono phase and get a load of Alex's Flock of Seagulls inspired hair lick.- Find out the origins of Rush's brief foray into Rap music and did they just say ""kick some Gluteus Max!!!???""- Rare footage of Neal Peart actually smiling.

The story of Getty Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neal Peart is one of unshakable determination and extremely uncompromising integrity.  Inspiring anecdotes fill the documentary, like when Neil said that they were going to do their next record [Hemispheres] the way they wanted to even if that meant not reaching a wider audience, losing their record contact and ending up back at their ""day jobs"".  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect I found was the very deep and respectful commentary from artists such as Billy Corgan and Trent Reznor (two artists I did't particularly care for - but have a new found respect for).  This documentary was a complete joy to watch from start to finish.  The inevitable discussion of Neal Peart's tragic few years in the late 90's was very sad to watch, but the story of their friendship and how the band came around to continue was amazing.  The restaurant scene at the end was hilarious and pretty much sums up why I think they've been together for 40 years. SEE IT!!I saw this on Showtime, but just ordered it on Blu-ray from Amazon.

Not really sure what to say about it other than it is an amazing, amazing, amazing film that surpassed my expectations. The old footage the filmmakers have dug up on these guys is by itself enough for me to give the film my highest recommmendation. One particularly notable example is footage of guitarist Alex Lifeson at a very young age (18? 19?) debating the pros and cons of a career as a professional musician with his parents at the dinnner table. Where did they get this? More interesting, who was sitting at Lifeson's family's dinner table documenting this (in color and sound, no less), way before Rush was famous? This is but one of the many joys to be had for the Rush fan in BEYOND THE LIGHTED STAGE, which I will not ennumerate, but instead simply say that if you have been a fan of this band at any point in your life, you need to see this film.

Rush's humor, which often escaped (and still does, remarkably) critics shines through on this set. The way the filmmakers and Alex, Geddy and Neil themselves explain things is fascinating. Now we know why Neil really never does meet-and-greets, even with equally famous people. The early footage of John Rutsey (RIP) on drums was rewarding too, from a historical pespective. What is more shocking, though, is how clean the ""Exit Stage Left"" concert footage looks on this release, compared to the DVD version released by Rush a few years back. The live 1981 clips on here look like they were shot yesterday, except for the slightly hazy, gauzy camera lens effect so often employed to movies and TV back in the early 1980s, and, of course, the fashion styles. Maybe we'll get a cleaned-up version of the ""Exit Stage Left"" movie with extra footage someday.Back to ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" - even hard-core Rush fans who think they know everything about Canada's most famous trio will be captivated by this documentary. I certainly learned a lot from watching, and I've been a fan since 1983. It's almost amazing to see film footage of Rush as teenagers - the clip of a young Lifeson defying his parents' wishes to pursue school is a time capsule deluxe. :)Picture and sound are clear and look great on the first disc. (Still waiting for the second (bonus features) DVD advance.) Rush fans will only be disappointed in the fact that we all wish this was a 3-hour documentary film, but 1 hour and 48 minutes is a lot better than nothing. Enjoy, and play it loud. Long live Rush ....P.S. The celebrity interviews included throughout the movie are like the ones included in The Who's equally great ""Amazing Journey"" documentary film - the talking head clips are short, to the point and never detract from Rush's greatness.

(Flight 666 could have been called the ""Bruce Dickenson Show, but I digress.) In this tale, we are introduced to two high school kids, Geddy and Alex, who, in the hope of escaping from some troubling aspect of their respective youths, founded a blues/prog-rock band that would go on to iconic status equal to the biggest of rock's acts. What we are introduced to is the three members of Rush looking back on their lives and careers from the wisdom of middle-age and explaining it all to their devoted fans. The tale is funny and filled with the usual, but vividly told, road-warrior tales of a young rock band starting out and pressing for success. All the accounts of the great shows, (and the bad ones) the amazing people (a special place is reserved for KISS here) they encountered on their path to world-wide success, the battles with short-sighted record company types, the critics, and the very heart-felt moments that their careers and friendships were built on.

The PQ is not HD, because this is almost all archival material, so do not judge this movie for its PQ.The movie tells the story of the Canadian progressive rock band RUSH, one of the best selling bands of all time (I believe they are third only after Beatles and Stones). It is told chronologically by chapters, starting when these guys were in high school, until the Snakes and Arrows tour.This movie shows how influential Rush were (and still are), and how important is to put passion in whatever you do in life, and do whatever your heart tells you, regardless of the fashion, and without an obsession to fit in.

1347222,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B003J27WFW,Christopher Culver,"[11, 12]","After a career of 35 years, the rock band Rush collaborated with filmmakers Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen on this very thorough documentary. Members Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart all sat down for very long interviews, the vaults were opened for a torrent of archival footage, and past producers and even the band's parents give their impression of the musicians.Fans will probably find the documentary most informative in its coverage of the band's early days. The account of Alex and Geddy upsetting their families by dropping out of school and touring is enriched by actual film footage of a teenage Alex arguing with his parents. It has long been said that drummer John Rutsey left the band because his health didn't permit touring, but here it is revealed that he was essentially forced out of the band against his wishes. Neil Peart's pre-Rush struggles are not discussed, but the account of his recruitment into the band is pretty entertaining. The band's sudden decline in the mid-1970s, when it seemed like it was all over until the 2112 album saved them, is frankly covered. Finally, the band's change from ambitious progressive rock to a shorter format is surprisingly linked to the struggles in the band's family lives. As we near the present day, details become more and more sparse. Geddy could have admitted that he screwed up the recording of VAPOR TRAILS and talked about the band's search for a new, competent producer for SNAKES AND ARROWS, but he doesn't. In fact, that most recent album as I write this is not mentioned at all, represented only by Neil Peart wearing a shirt with the album's logo in footage from The Colbert Report.The documentary also covers the band's interaction with fans. Alex and Geddy show that they don't mind signing autographs or holding meet-and-greets. Neil Peart is infamously adverse to meeting fans, and the way he spastically flails about just at the mention of this reputation suggests that it's a lot more than simple shyness. On the other hand, the documentary seems to go out of its way to portray fans as freaks you'd want to stay well away from. The band's following is mainly represented by participants of RushCon, a subculture that isn't representative of 99% of Rush fans. We get an interview with a nerdy fellow, then a rather, uh, flamboyant guy. (The Rushcon extras on the second DVD are just salt in the wound.) Some musical celebrities are brought on to show Rush has had a major influence on rock. Some, like Les Claypool and Jack Black are nice to watch, but Skid Row's Sebastian Bach and the bassist from Rage Against the Machine are repulsive slobs and just undermine Rush's reputation.The extras in the second DVD are mainly divided into two groups. First up are episodes cut from the documentary, such as a discussion of the band's hobbies and some explanation of the rap episode on the ROLL THE BONES album. The second group consists of archival footage of full-length performances of songs, ranging from 1974 to 2002. The sound quality of these concert performances is not great, but it's fun to see the band's appearance and playing change from era to era.In spite of its few flaws, the amount of detail here surpasses most musical documentaries I've seen and is sure to entertain those who have followed Rush's career.",4,An enormous amount of detail for a standard-length documentary,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,3302,"['career', '35', 'years', 'rock', 'band', 'Rush', 'collaborated', 'filmmakers', 'Sam', 'Dunn', 'Scot', 'McFadyen', 'very', 'thorough', 'documentary', 'Members', 'Alex', 'Lifeson', 'Geddy', 'Lee', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'sat', 'down', 'very', 'long', 'interviews', 'vaults', 'were', 'opened', 'torrent', 'archival', 'footage', 'past', 'producers', 'even', 'band', 'parents', 'give', 'impression', 'musicians.Fans', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'documentary', 'most', 'informative', 'coverage', 'band', 'early', 'days', 'account', 'Alex', 'Geddy', 'upsetting', 'families', 'dropping', 'school', 'touring', 'enriched', 'actual', 'film', 'footage', 'teenage', 'Alex', 'arguing', 'parents', 'long', 'been', 'said', 'drummer', 'John', 'Rutsey', 'left', 'band', 'health', 'did', ""n't"", 'permit', 'touring', 'here', 'revealed', 'was', 'essentially', 'forced', 'band', 'wishes', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'pre-Rush', 'struggles', 'are', 'not', 'discussed', 'account', 'recruitment', 'band', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'band', 'sudden', 'decline', 'mid-1970s', 'when', 'seemed', 'was', '2112', 'album', 'saved', 'frankly', 'covered', 'Finally', 'band', 'change', 'ambitious', 'progressive', 'rock', 'shorter', 'format', 'surprisingly', 'linked', 'struggles', 'band', 'family', 'near', 'present', 'day', 'details', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'sparse', 'Geddy', 'could', 'have', 'admitted', 'screwed', 'up', 'recording', 'VAPOR', 'TRAILS', 'talked', 'band', 'search', 'new', 'competent', 'producer', 'SNAKES', 'AND', 'ARROWS', ""n't"", 'fact', 'most', 'recent', 'album', 'write', 'not', 'mentioned', 'represented', 'only', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'wearing', 'shirt', 'album', 'logo', 'footage', 'Colbert', 'Report.The', 'documentary', 'also', 'band', 'interaction', 'fans', 'Alex', 'Geddy', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'signing', 'autographs', 'holding', 'meet-and-greets', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'infamously', 'adverse', 'meeting', 'fans', 'way', 'spastically', 'about', 'just', 'mention', 'reputation', 'lot', 'more', 'simple', 'shyness', 'other', 'hand', 'documentary', 'go', 'out', 'way', 'portray', 'fans', 'freaks', ""'d"", 'want', 'stay', 'well', 'away', 'band', 'following', 'mainly', 'represented', 'participants', 'RushCon', 'subculture', ""n't"", 'representative', '99', '%', 'Rush', 'fans', 'get', 'interview', 'nerdy', 'fellow', 'then', 'rather', 'uh', 'flamboyant', 'guy', 'Rushcon', 'extras', 'second', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'salt', 'wound', 'musical', 'celebrities', 'are', 'brought', 'show', 'Rush', 'had', 'major', 'influence', 'rock', 'Les', 'Claypool', 'Jack', 'Black', 'are', 'nice', 'watch', 'Skid', 'Row', 'Sebastian', 'Bach', 'bassist', 'Rage', 'Against', 'Machine', 'are', 'repulsive', 'slobs', 'just', 'undermine', 'Rush', 'reputation.The', 'extras', 'second', 'DVD', 'are', 'mainly', 'divided', 'two', 'groups', 'First', 'up', 'are', 'episodes', 'cut', 'documentary', 'such', 'discussion', 'band', 'hobbies', 'explanation', 'rap', 'episode', 'ROLL', 'THE', 'BONES', 'album', 'second', 'group', 'archival', 'footage', 'full-length', 'performances', 'songs', 'ranging', '1974', '2002', 'sound', 'quality', 'concert', 'performances', 'not', 'great', 'fun', 'see', 'band', 'appearance', 'playing', 'change', 'era', 'era.In', 'spite', 'few', 'flaws', 'amount', 'detail', 'here', 'most', 'musical', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sure', 'entertain', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'Rush', 'career']",Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage

At the time of writing this I must set a few things straight to the reading public.First, I think the most fruitful periods of Rush were the Terry Brown period -  2112 - Through Signals. Terry did work on a few albums prior but I felt those particular albums were the best in terms of writing and arranging.  I think Terry was integral in their sound.  I think he latched on to the strong points of Rush and exploited it to their advantage.Ok, with that being said Strong points of the film for me:First, we see for the first time the early period that included John Rutsey.  I didn't realize he was the spokesperson of the band at this time.  We see some historic video of him introducing the members of the band etc.Secondly, There is this early video of Alex Lifeson addressing his parents in a room of other people discusing his future as a musician rather than following the norm.  I am wondering where this video came from.  I think it was astounding that the producers got hold of this.  It almost had a feel it was an early documentary in which Lifeson was a part of.  Would like to know more about it, but it is a gem here to see Alex in such raw and rebelious form as a young man.Thirdly, they touched base on the period of Rush in which keyboards took over, namely in the later 80's.  I left Rush for a period after this and it also was the same period in which Terry Brown Left  (After Signals). It just reinforced my own belief here that something changed.  I never thought that it was a positive change, because I don't think Rush has ever been as productive as they were in the Brown period.  In saying that however, they are monumental live and always have been.I am glad they also shot some video of Neil on the road with his motorcycle.  I have read all his books.  I feel he is unbelievable as an author.  For those who think he is un-reachable to the fans, he is a completely different person in his books and very very genuine.Now for the weak parts and for which I took off a star:This documentary did not Need the likes of Jack Black or Gene Simmons to give any interviews here.  I thought it cheapened the production and made it more theatrical.  I didn't care about those parts.  The documentary could have stood on it's own without stars lending words to Rush.  Rush was never mainstream and hard to classify except for people like me and the devoted.  You either like Rush or not.  There is no in-between here.Overall a great documentary.

No, I can't claim to have been there for the first album but I managed to make it to the 2112 tour and have been a fan ever since. There were some albums that I didn't care for but I always tried to attend their shows if I could since they were always great.There is a major lesson here. In reviewing the evolution of RUSH through this documentary one comes away with a new look at success without excess. It seems counter to what we think we know about a successful rock 'n roll band and that point is abundantly clear in this film. How can these guys be so cool and yet so modest and earthbound? The answer is deceptively simple: They stayed true to themselves and they rocked their asses off.

1347229,A1R7R0Q678QND,B003J27WFW,D. J. Walsh,"[1, 1]","First - the scene where Alex talks about dropping out was from ""Come On Children"", a documentary by Allan King from 1972. It predated reality TV - 10 troubled teens living on a farm for 10 weeks. It's actually going to be released on Criterion DVD in September as part of ""The Actuality Dramas of Allan King"".It's a wealth of info on a band that has been together over 40 years, how two guys from high school bonded and through pure hard work and opportunity, paved their own road to success, and there were a lot of bumps along the way. They explain why the first drummer left, they also had unbelievable love and support from their parents, which is what really came through to me. Their manager Ray also talks a lot about life on the road. A lot of big names in music are on here, but it was actually Gene Simmons and Rush discussing touring together - you realize that tour in particular put them on the map.There's more focus on the rise to success, than when they hit it big in the early 80s when ""Moving Pictures"" took them to another level. But they do discuss the loss of privacy (the part where Geddy and Alex go to a restaurant is hilarious, and Neil boasts being able to be anonymous yet be around people), and the fans.Of course, Neil was hit with unbelievable tragedy in the late 90s, and because Neil's already written about it in ""Ghost Rider"", Alex and Geddy are left to discuss it in the film, as well as the band getting back on its feet in 2002. Their appearance on Colbert is also mentioned. I think the only part missing that should've been included was the Toronto Rocks benefit.All in all, an excellent documentary for fans of Rush as well as any music documentary for that matter.Interesting tidbit - the 1974 rare footage with Rutsey, was filmed in St Catherines. Neil Peart's hometown. And even though it's not mentioned here, Rolling Stone finally interviewed Rush in 2008.. of course Rush wasn't on the cover (Obama was).Once you're done watching it, you're going to be compelled to listen to their music.

A unique Rockumentary that has many different dimensions of the band in full view. From the early years through the present, it takes you through their career from album to album in a loose, chronological way. Shows some of the highs and lows and a peak into the creative energy that the band still seems to have. Neil Peart explains his writing style and ideology a bit. There are several concert footage scenes, but if you are going expecting to see a lot of music, you may be disappointed.... for a minute.More than anything, this is a film about real guys who had a desire and need to do what they are doing. Its a movie that touches you. The friendship and brotherly compassion that these guys have for one another is well defined. And though Neil Peart had horrific losses and tragedies in his life some years back, it seems the band has truly come full circle now and are closer than ever. I found the scenes of Peart traveling and speaking of how he and the band handled that period in his life to be a very candid and inspiring. Something positive can come from negatives.Their is a real sense of respect you get to see a few men in their 60's, after doing the same thing for 45 years, still want to tweak their craft and reach to new levels musically. Most bands of their genre live on recycling the past, but that clearly is not the case. It is also good to see such a strong fan base grow with them. That is magical. And they have that. Not just by looking at concert ticket sales for the last 30 years, but by seeing how many people were at the theater tonight only solidified my opinion.So that is what makes this whole film work. Not really just the music element, but the human element. Even if you aren't the biggest fan, you will enjoy the flow, the bands story and Alex Lifeson's witty sense of humor! Its a very well done documentary that has no boring moments. There are many cut away's to other musicians and entertainers speaking about the band that are funny and honest. Aside from Jack Black being in several scenes, Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins)is featured many times as is Gene Simmons, speaking of taking the band on their first major tour. Sebastian Bach is there as well. But it does not diminish the quality of the film. Only makes you appreciate the range of people they have influenced.Overall I will say A+! Great film.See it in a theater if you can, because it just looks great on the big screen and sounds EXCELLENT! Now I too have finally come to appreciate this excellent and classy band.

They missed so much it was like you spent 70% of the film in the 1970s and you sneezed through the their biggest decade the 1980s and they decided to use their bias and show negative opinions about it.That is junk journalism and junk film making. Sure, you can present the argument that not everybody was on-board with the 80s and 90s Rush, but other than Corgan and Reznor...how about the hundreds of other artists out there who loved the 80s Rush? So many people should have been included in this documentary and they should have made a version for TV and one for the theater/dvd because 106 minutes on a band that is 40 years old is a joke.Again, this is a good stepping stone DVD if you want to get into the story of why Rush became Rush. But you are missing out on HOW Rush became RUSH.No mention of awards, order of canada, readers polls, charity work, harvard lampoon, artist of the decade in Canada, hall of fame in canada, the debate on them not being in the rock and roll hall of fame here in the U.S., no mention of their solo albums, no in-depth look into all of Neil's solos.

1347232,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B003J27WFW,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[1, 1]","I've been a Rush fan since I first heard 'All The World's A Stage' Rush's first live album in 1976. Even though it took some getting used to Geddy's vocals, I always knew these guys could play their A $$'s off! There are probably only two groups left on the planet that I buy their new albums without hesitation one being The Rolling Stones and the other of course Rush. While the Stones haven't put out a great album in a long time, I still find their new offerings interesting.Rush on the other hand has delivered great album after great album, but even these musical giants have had their moments were they didn't top their last effort. For me I feel that the band continued to grow up to 'Hold Your Fire'. That doesn't mean that it's my favorite album, but there was a gradual climb to that point. When 'Presto' was released it marked the first time the band sounded like they went backwards...I know now that this was intentional. After 'Roll The Bones' the band started to dig in and really grow again with some of the newest albums technically amazing, but lacking in melody. I still love and own all of their albums and have nothing but the greatest respect for these stellar musicians and songwriters.I'm giving a little back history here because now with 'Rush Beyond The Lighted Stage' I get to hear what I've known for years from the guys who have influenced me and countless other musicians to play a little harder and I get to hear a lot of stuff that I didn't know about. While I and every other Rush fan would have liked this documentary to go on for hours, I think it is really well put together even though it should have been at least another 45 minutes longer.I can understand why this film is 106 minutes, but considering the fan base, I can't believe that the members of Rush didn't realize that Rush fans would want a much longer in depth look at the band's History. The early years are well done, but it seems to &#34;rush&#34; by the later years and even though the film is really quite good, I think with a little more effort, it could have been the definitive documentary all Rush fans were looking for.The Blu Ray has all of the extras that are on the two discs DVD, but to be honest, with all the early footage used in this piece, there is really little reason to buy the Blu Ray over the standard DVD as visual quality is really not all that much better. The small segments in HD will look fine on standard and the old stuff might even look a little better. If you don't own a Blu Ray player this is certainly not the reason to go and buy one.I rate the documentary itself 4 1/2 stars and the extras 5 stars for some very cool old concert footage with John Rutsey and other obscurities. Most of the other extras are mostly made up of segments that appear in the film as clips, are presented here more elaborately.

After that forget it, and i've really tried to like their newer stuff (Vapor Trails, Snakes) but sorry it just doesn't cut it for me.  Fortunately this movie has a lot of clips from the early years when they just smoked.  I have fond memories of seeing them live in 1976 and 77 and the clips bring back the intensity of those gigs.  You knew something was going wrong when they started wearing skinny ties on the Moving Pictures tour.  The later clips of them during their ""synth-pop"" phase are hysterical, Geddy's hairdo, the corny videos, etc.  It was unbelievable that this was the same band that did 2112!!It never really was the same after that, try as they might to go back to a power trio format.  Guess they were just getting too old to rock(they should hang out with Lemmy more often...or Angus).  They seem like nice guys, though.In any event it's a good watch, they really avoid making ""fun"" of them or interviewing fans of the older material asking them what they thought of the direction change.

And yes, yes, I'm a Rush fan...but I'm not a RABID Rush fan.  I'm missing a few of their albums and while I have a ticket to see them in concert this fall, that will be the first time.  I say this only by way of stating for the NON-Rush fan: Don't let that deter you from seeing this great documentary.  There is so little actual music in it, that anyone, even those just interested in human interest stories and biopics, will find plenty to love here.  There is close friendship, tragedy, very comical moments, inspiration...the whole package.  And how great is it to see ""rock stars"" who are intelligent and generally lacking an over-inflated sense of ego?  I think my favorite moment in the film might have come when the trio was aboard a plane, heading, if I remember right, to their next concert, and they all three pulled out books and began to read.  I didn't see what everyone was reading, but Alex was half through Christopher Hitchens'God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.  I have a hard time picturing just about any other rock stars doing something like that--with the possible exception of Bad Religion's Greg Graffin.One funny thing from the film showing of ""Beyond.""  I arrived fairly early, and then three other guys sat down to my left, and then a few minutes later another guy was about to sit in the single seat remaining to my right, and I asked him, ""Couldn't get your girlfriend to come either, huh?""  And he said, ""No, my wife wouldn't come.""  And the guys to my left said, ""Yeah, ours either.""  So there we were, a row of middle-aged, none-too-thin white dudes, enjoying the hell out of this movie.  It had a good tribal sort of feeling to it, bonding with like-minded strangers like this.

1347239,AC0C4R4RK1WP7,B003J27WFW,"Jim Stalker ""Jim Stalker""","[1, 1]","The band Rush is the Rodney Dangerfield of music - no respect.  Despite dozens of gold albums and decades of consistently sold out concerts - Rush's extraordinary musicianship and half dozen bona-fide rock anthems are consistently ignored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (and critics in general) in favor of critic's darlings The Stooges (among others).  To some Rush fans, this is an outrage and part of the Hall's conspiratorial bias against progressive rock that has kept Yes, and until last year, Genesis, out of the Hall.But this isn't the whole story.Rush is an odd band. Their vocalist, Geddy Lee,  sounds like ""a hamster being chased by a flamethrower."" Their lyrics, written by drummer Neil Peart, while drawing on numerous literary sources (most famously Ayn Rand) - can be some of the most tedious in rock. When it all comes together however, like it does on ""Tom Sawyer"" ""Free Will"" or ""Spirit of Radio"" and a dozen or more other songs, Rush's music is something  unique that ROCKS! I dare say a song like ""Limelight"" is downright irresistible to any fan of rock and roll. The opening riff, the drum fills, the lyrics, the spacey middle section - all epic and iconic at the same time. Is it any wonder it can be found on the game Rockband!Thanks in part to the bands longevity, some are taking a second look at Rush and their place in rock and roll history. Recent appearances by the band in the movie ""I Love You Man"" and the TV show The Colbert Report have brought them back into a bit of, ahem, limelight.A terrific new documentary, ""Rush - Behind the Lighted Stage,"" furthers the case for revisiting this often dismissed band as one of the great bands of rock. Filmmakers Scot McFadyn and Sam Dunn, previously of Heavy Metal: A Headbanger's Journey and Iron Maiden: Flight 666, clearly know their material and have created a most respectful, mostly chronological, documentary of the band.Having full access to the band and their inner circle, McFadyn and Dunn provide a portrait of Rush's history from their high school struggles and early gigs, the addition of ""new guy"" Neil Peart, and their evolution as music makers from concept albums to more radio friendly tracks.  What emerges from this telling are three pretty regular Canadian guys who seem down right well adjusted and relatively nonplussed by their fame and success - this despite the constant criticism and a few personal traumas (Peart lost his daughter and wife).  They really seem to enjoy each other, the music they make, and the fans that like them. No bitterness comes through. There is little Behind the Music to unearth, and this documentary avoids that more tabloid tone.What also emerges is their incredible precision as musicians. ""If you can play Rush, you can play anything!""Talking heads like, Gene Simmons, Trent Reznor, Billy Corgan, and Jack Black (among others) provide witty and insightful commentary about Rush's career while showing the influence Rush has had on many of today's musicians. Clearly the respect for Rush runs deeper with musicians than the critics.I hope some members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame view this as they may find they actually respect Rush more than they realize, and vote them in. For everyone else, it's just a great documentary to be enjoyed recalling how fresh it was to hear ""Fly by Night"" all those years ago.",5,Rodney Dangerfeild of Rock!,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,3348,"['band', 'Rush', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'music', 'respect', 'dozens', 'gold', 'albums', 'decades', 'consistently', 'sold', 'out', 'concerts', 'Rush', 'extraordinary', 'musicianship', 'half', 'dozen', 'bona-fide', 'rock', 'anthems', 'are', 'consistently', 'ignored', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'critics', 'general', 'favor', 'critic', 'darlings', 'Stooges', 'others', 'Rush', 'fans', 'outrage', 'part', 'Hall', 'conspiratorial', 'bias', 'progressive', 'rock', 'kept', 'Yes', 'last', 'year', 'Genesis', 'Hall.But', ""n't"", 'whole', 'story.Rush', 'odd', 'band', 'vocalist', 'Geddy', 'Lee', 'hamster', 'being', 'chased', 'flamethrower', 'lyrics', 'written', 'drummer', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'drawing', 'numerous', 'literary', 'sources', 'most', 'famously', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'can', 'be', 'most', 'tedious', 'rock', 'When', 'together', 'however', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Free', 'Will', 'Spirit', 'Radio', 'dozen', 'more', 'other', 'songs', 'Rush', 'music', 'something', 'unique', 'ROCKS', 'dare', 'say', 'song', 'Limelight', 'downright', 'irresistible', 'fan', 'rock', 'roll', 'opening', 'riff', 'drum', 'fills', 'lyrics', 'spacey', 'middle', 'section', 'epic', 'iconic', 'same', 'time', 'wonder', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'game', 'Rockband', 'Thanks', 'part', 'bands', 'longevity', 'are', 'taking', 'second', 'look', 'Rush', 'place', 'rock', 'roll', 'history', 'Recent', 'appearances', 'band', 'movie', 'Love', 'Man', 'TV', 'show', 'Colbert', 'Report', 'have', 'brought', 'back', 'bit', 'ahem', 'limelight.A', 'terrific', 'new', 'documentary', 'Rush', 'Lighted', 'Stage', 'case', 'revisiting', 'often', 'dismissed', 'band', 'one', 'great', 'bands', 'rock', 'Filmmakers', 'Scot', 'McFadyn', 'Sam', 'Dunn', 'previously', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Headbanger', 'Journey', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'Flight', '666', 'clearly', 'know', 'material', 'have', 'created', 'most', 'respectful', 'mostly', 'chronological', 'documentary', 'band.Having', 'full', 'access', 'band', 'inner', 'circle', 'McFadyn', 'Dunn', 'provide', 'portrait', 'Rush', 'history', 'high', 'school', 'struggles', 'early', 'gigs', 'addition', 'new', 'guy', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'evolution', 'music', 'makers', 'concept', 'albums', 'more', 'radio', 'friendly', 'tracks', 'What', 'telling', 'are', 'three', 'pretty', 'regular', 'Canadian', 'guys', 'who', 'seem', 'down', 'right', 'well', 'adjusted', 'relatively', 'nonplussed', 'fame', 'success', 'constant', 'criticism', 'few', 'personal', 'traumas', 'Peart', 'lost', 'daughter', 'wife', 'really', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'other', 'music', 'make', 'fans', 'like', 'bitterness', 'little', 'Music', 'unearth', 'documentary', 'avoids', 'more', 'tabloid', 'also', 'incredible', 'precision', 'musicians', 'can', 'play', 'Rush', 'can', 'play', 'anything', 'Talking', 'heads', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'Trent', 'Reznor', 'Billy', 'Corgan', 'Jack', 'Black', 'others', 'provide', 'witty', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'Rush', 'career', 'showing', 'influence', 'Rush', 'had', 'many', 'today', 'musicians', 'Clearly', 'respect', 'Rush', 'musicians', 'critics.I', 'hope', 'members', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'view', 'may', 'find', 'actually', 'respect', 'Rush', 'more', 'realize', 'vote', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'great', 'documentary', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'recalling', 'how', 'fresh', 'was', 'hear', 'Fly', 'Night', 'years', 'ago']",Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage

This seems to have been built for someone who knows nothing about the band while covering elements that a hardcore fan may have never known. I thought I knew it all. I thought I'd seen every photo. I thought I'd viewed every clip. I've been a fan since 1984. These guys continue to pull stuff out of the mothballs that suspends my disbelief. Who knew there was film of Alex telling his family that he planned to drop out of high school?! It was so nice that they shared that classic moment. Alex keeps his feelings just below the surface and to be able to see one of the most key moments in his upbringing was truly a treasure. And Geddy may not write the lyrics but he speaks with great tact and clarity regarding Neil's personal history. On Neil- I'd love to chat him up but that possibility is addressed too. In simple terms, I can relate to the embarrassment he feels as I have a coworker who would hug me hourly if I allowed it. Neil has nothing to be embarrassed about but we don't give this much adulation to the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker. His dignity is fed by his work and not much else. When fans emasculate themselves when trying to tell him how much they admire him, he gets uncomfortable.Values. That's probably the biggest eye opener for me personally as a fan since 1984. I share a lot of the same values as these guys and their satisfaction comes from two things: Working on the their craft and being philomaths on learning new crafts. Professional perfectionists who want to punch the time clock, go home and read a book or watch a thought provoking movie. Girls, vices and other distractions cut into this time and they won't have that! They do emphasize the value of play, family, friends but only after they've exhausted themselves with their craft. One other favorite moment is an early outdoor interview with Geddy that I'd seen before on a another DVD. Geddy appears to be bored if not snarky with the interviewer. They cut to current day Geddy and he seems to acknowledge their burnout in the early days of playing night after night with few breaks. I also feel that all the kudos from other celebrities validates Rush in a way that reveals that their following is not so underground anymore.",5,Great if you knew nothing OR thought you knew it all,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,2378,"['truly', 'definitive', 'retrospective', 'Rush', 'have', 'been', 'chasing', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'thru', 'other', 'releases', 'DVD', 'book', 'form', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'someone', 'who', 'nothing', 'band', 'covering', 'elements', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'thought', 'knew', 'thought', ""'d"", 'seen', 'photo', 'thought', ""'d"", 'viewed', 'clip', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', '1984', 'guys', 'continue', 'pull', 'stuff', 'mothballs', 'disbelief', 'Who', 'knew', 'was', 'film', 'Alex', 'telling', 'family', 'planned', 'drop', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'shared', 'classic', 'moment', 'Alex', 'feelings', 'just', 'surface', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'one', 'most', 'key', 'moments', 'upbringing', 'was', 'truly', 'treasure', 'Geddy', 'may', 'not', 'write', 'lyrics', 'great', 'tact', 'clarity', 'regarding', 'Neil', 'personal', 'history', 'Neil-', ""'d"", 'love', 'chat', 'up', 'possibility', 'addressed', 'too', 'simple', 'terms', 'can', 'relate', 'embarrassment', 'have', 'coworker', 'who', 'would', 'hug', 'hourly', 'allowed', 'Neil', 'nothing', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'adulation', 'butcher', 'baker', 'candlestick', 'maker', 'dignity', 'fed', 'work', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'When', 'fans', 'emasculate', 'when', 'trying', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'admire', 'uncomfortable.Values', 'probably', 'biggest', 'eye', 'opener', 'personally', 'fan', '1984', 'share', 'lot', 'same', 'values', 'guys', 'satisfaction', 'two', 'things', 'Working', 'craft', 'being', 'philomaths', 'learning', 'new', 'crafts', 'Professional', 'perfectionists', 'who', 'want', 'punch', 'time', 'clock', 'go', 'home', 'read', 'book', 'watch', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'Girls', 'vices', 'other', 'distractions', 'cut', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'emphasize', 'value', 'play', 'family', 'friends', 'only', ""'ve"", 'exhausted', 'craft', 'One', 'other', 'favorite', 'moment', 'early', 'outdoor', 'interview', 'Geddy', ""'d"", 'seen', 'before', 'DVD', 'Geddy', 'be', 'bored', 'not', 'snarky', 'interviewer', 'cut', 'current', 'day', 'Geddy', 'acknowledge', 'burnout', 'early', 'days', 'playing', 'night', 'night', 'few', 'breaks', 'also', 'feel', 'kudos', 'other', 'celebrities', 'Rush', 'way', 'reveals', 'following', 'not', 'so', 'underground', 'anymore']",Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage
1347241,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B003J27WFW,"JJD ""John""","[1, 1]","I can't begin to express how much I love this film. Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen have done it yet again...but upped the bar VERY high that I think it would prove difficult to match or surpass this masterpiece. I have been a big fan of their films thus far (Global Metal being my personal fave). This film puts a face and persona with a very enigmatic band. Sure..We (the fans) have been to the shows, watched the DVDs, listened intently to each release, but never could put a finger on who these three master craftsmen really are. At the shows, you see a glimpse with some irreverent humor and get the impression that they enjoy what they do..but never really know just how strong their ties are.Rush are an anomaly..pure and simple. They truly are an exception to the rule that is not only the music business, but celebrity and showbiz as a whole. They are the penultimate ""grass roots/cult"" band. They are dismissed entirely by those not ""in the know"" and revered with an almost deity-like devotion by those of us who are paying attention and listening. WE know why they are successful and love the fact that the nay sayers just don't get it. No matter how many records they sell or how many stadiums they fill...each one of us true fans still feel that they are still our own ""big little secret"". We love it that way.The film does a splendid job of giving an up close and personal look at three very distinct personalities. Alex and Geddy, being friends since junior high, are two fairly different fellows, yet their bond is so obviously tight that you would think them separated at birth. Neil, on the other hand, seems like a very different matter. While he seems at ease with the other two and they obviously share a bond as well..he comes across as a very solitary man.I admire the fact that he seems uncomfortable being admired by fans..yet loves the idea of having a conversation with a complete stranger at a gas station on his motorcycle travels. It really does make sense that he would have to keep low key among ""fans"" because he embraces his ability to travel so far and so often, yet remain unrecognized by most people he encounters. That's not necessarily a BAD thing, he's just clearly ""different"" from Alex and Geddy. I think one of the reasons some of us connect with this band, is that we can relate to these guys on some level. Some of us like to be open and outgoing, if not completely silly..yet at times we enjoy nothing more than silence and deep thought. There's a dichotomy within this trio that seems to really spark the ""chemistry"" that they clearly have in spades!!If I had one minor complaint..I really think this could have been much LONGER. This should have been their ""Anthology"". I think more detail could have been spent on the 80's, which was their pinnacle in terms of success. ""Grace Under Pressure"" alone could have taken up a fair amount of time in examining it's controversy among their die-hard fans. While we, the fans, love the fact that this film was ever MADE...ultimately, it is the fans that will appreciate and love this because the admiration is there before it even begins.Neil's personal tragedies circa 1997-1998 are well handled and crafted with complete respect and reverence.

1347243,A2TA37C7P7711W,B003J27WFW,John A. Bertels,"[0, 0]","""Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage"" is an interesting, entertaining 2-DVD set that offers a chronology of one of the most influential progressive rock bands ever and certainly, the most famous as a 3-piece act. The first includes the history of the band from the Lifeson/Lee high school days to present and the second, a video scrapbook of clips, some rare and some available on other Rush DVD sets.The first DVD is a little more than an hour in length and although the material is priceless, I was a little disappointed as a longtime Rush fan that it was not longer. There is definitely enough to mention with the band's 40-plus years to cover at least 2 hours, if not more. Certain important periods of the band's history, e.g. A Farewell to Kings (after 2112) were grouped in a period representing the introduction of the use of synthesizers in the band's music. It would have been nice to have certain barely-mentioned albums given a little more commentary. Even so, this DVD is definitely worth its weight, with comments offered by various other musicians, the likes of Sebastian Bach, Gene Simmons, Jack Black, Les Claypool and others.Through the camera lens, we see the formation of the Lifeson/Lee bond in the high school years and the early version of Rush with John Rutsey. After the first album, Rush decides that Rutsey's health is too questionable for him to endure the rigors of constant touring. Shortly after, the Neil Peart audition happens and the new version of Rush forms with Lee and Lifeson more convinced by Neil's phenomenal drumming and intellect than his outward appearance. The new Rush is born and the progressive rock world is about to change forever. Some rare footage of these early periods is offered and the video quality is excellent.From that point, we see that the Lee/Lifeson/Peart trio endures some tough early years with pressure from the record label to conform and the band resisting, marching to ""its own beat"". These were very difficult times for Rush and nearly resulted in its own dissolving. The breakthrough was ""2112"", which to the label's surprise, gained quite a cult following. At that juncture, Rush was then able to dictate back to the label just what it would play, as well as how it would write/arrange its music.Later scenes progress through Rush's success in every significant period: Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace Under Pressure, etc. through the desire to minimize or eliminate the use of keyboards (Test for Echo), the unimaginable tragedy of Peart and the triumphant return of Rush.One of the most significant features throughout the DVD is Neil Peart joking and smiling in front of the camera. This is a major juxtaposition of his expressions offered while onstage and reveals the side of him that fans really want to see. Of course, the life of fame, coupled with highly intrusive fans and personal tragedy have changed him. I just watched the Grace Under Pressure DVD (1984)(Rush Replay X3) and he was a totally different guy, very relaxed in front of the camera and not uptight at all. He might be humble and private in nature, but he should accept that he is widely considered to be one of the most (if not THE MOST) accomplished drummers in the history of modern music. Not only that, but the drummer/lyricist-turned-social and environmental psychologist has authored the lyrics to some of the most phenomenally important songs in the last 30 years of rock:  The Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions, Distant Early Warning, The Big Money, etc....Through both of the DVDs, one can see the personal chemistry that has made Rush successful throughout their history: it happens offstage as well as on. An intimate bond of friendship between highly-talented musicians doesn't happen often and it's no wonder that Rush is so highly regarded by their fellow musicians. Their individual abilities transcend into superstardom, whose fans have long since inducted them into their own Rock 'N Roll Hall Of Fame.This DVD set is definitely for old Rush fans, but also new ones just coming onto the scene who want to learn about the extraordinary musicianship of perhaps the greatest ""cult"" band of all time.",5,An Excellent History of Rush,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,4182,"['Rush', 'Lighted', 'Stage', 'interesting', 'entertaining', '2-DVD', 'set', 'chronology', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'progressive', 'rock', 'bands', 'ever', 'certainly', 'most', 'famous', '3-piece', 'act', 'first', 'history', 'band', 'Lifeson/Lee', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'present', 'second', 'video', 'scrapbook', 'clips', 'rare', 'available', 'other', 'Rush', 'DVD', 'sets.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'little', 'more', 'hour', 'length', 'material', 'priceless', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'longtime', 'Rush', 'fan', 'was', 'not', 'longer', 'definitely', 'enough', 'mention', 'band', '40-plus', 'years', 'cover', 'least', '2', 'hours', 'not', 'more', 'Certain', 'important', 'periods', 'band', 'history', 'e.g', 'Farewell', 'Kings', '2112', 'were', 'grouped', 'period', 'representing', 'introduction', 'use', 'synthesizers', 'band', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'certain', 'barely-mentioned', 'albums', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'commentary', 'Even', 'so', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'weight', 'comments', 'offered', 'various', 'other', 'musicians', 'likes', 'Sebastian', 'Bach', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Les', 'Claypool', 'camera', 'see', 'formation', 'Lifeson/Lee', 'bond', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'early', 'version', 'Rush', 'John', 'Rutsey', 'first', 'album', 'Rush', 'Rutsey', 'health', 'too', 'questionable', 'endure', 'rigors', 'constant', 'touring', 'Shortly', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'audition', 'happens', 'new', 'version', 'Rush', 'forms', 'Lee', 'Lifeson', 'more', 'convinced', 'Neil', 'phenomenal', 'drumming', 'intellect', 'outward', 'appearance', 'new', 'Rush', 'born', 'progressive', 'rock', 'world', 'change', 'forever', 'rare', 'footage', 'early', 'periods', 'offered', 'video', 'quality', 'point', 'see', 'Lee/Lifeson/Peart', 'trio', 'tough', 'early', 'years', 'pressure', 'record', 'label', 'conform', 'band', 'resisting', 'marching', 'own', 'beat', 'were', 'very', 'difficult', 'times', 'Rush', 'nearly', 'resulted', 'own', 'dissolving', 'breakthrough', 'was', '2112', 'label', 'surprise', 'gained', 'quite', 'cult', 'following', 'juncture', 'Rush', 'was', 'then', 'able', 'dictate', 'back', 'label', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'would', 'write/arrange', 'music.Later', 'scenes', 'progress', 'Rush', 'success', 'significant', 'period', 'Permanent', 'Waves', 'Moving', 'Pictures', 'Signals', 'Grace', 'Pressure', 'etc', 'desire', 'minimize', 'eliminate', 'use', 'keyboards', 'Test', 'Echo', 'unimaginable', 'tragedy', 'Peart', 'triumphant', 'return', 'Rush.One', 'most', 'significant', 'features', 'DVD', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'joking', 'smiling', 'front', 'camera', 'major', 'juxtaposition', 'expressions', 'offered', 'onstage', 'side', 'fans', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'course', 'life', 'fame', 'coupled', 'highly', 'intrusive', 'fans', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'have', 'changed', 'just', 'watched', 'Grace', 'Pressure', 'DVD', '1984', 'Rush', 'Replay', 'X3', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'guy', 'very', 'relaxed', 'front', 'camera', 'not', 'uptight', 'might', 'be', 'humble', 'private', 'nature', 'should', 'accept', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'not', 'THE', 'MOST', 'accomplished', 'drummers', 'history', 'modern', 'music', 'Not', 'only', 'drummer/lyricist-turned-social', 'environmental', 'psychologist', 'authored', 'lyrics', 'most', 'phenomenally', 'important', 'songs', 'last', '30', 'years', 'rock', 'Spirit', 'Radio', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Subdivisions', 'Distant', 'Early', 'Warning', 'Big', 'Money', 'etc', 'DVDs', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'personal', 'chemistry', 'made', 'Rush', 'successful', 'history', 'offstage', 'as', 'well', 'intimate', 'bond', 'friendship', 'highly-talented', 'musicians', ""n't"", 'happen', 'often', 'wonder', 'Rush', 'so', 'highly', 'regarded', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'individual', 'abilities', 'transcend', 'superstardom', 'fans', 'have', 'long', 'inducted', 'own', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'definitely', 'old', 'Rush', 'fans', 'also', 'new', 'ones', 'just', 'coming', 'scene', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'extraordinary', 'musicianship', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'cult', 'band', 'time']",Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage

Being the selfish sort that I am, I insisted on watching it and not waiting days until my guests left. The female of the pair had barely heard of Rush, and was certainly not a fan.

She watched the entire film, and said that she really enjoyed it!I can't add much that has not already been said in other reviews, but this is a film for fans of musicians, entertainers, and underdogs in general. Obviously it's all about Rush, but the story at the core is that three very talented musicians were able to achieve great success while maintaining their integrity (not just an illusion here) and creative freedom.The most enjoyable portions of the documentary for me are the exchanges between the band members, often very candid. It is clear that these men are close friends and care very much for one another - even beyond their bond within the band. I truly believe that they put their friendship above the success of the band.The Blu-ray and DVD contain about 1 1/2 hours of extra footage, some of which is priceless.

Who's the party pooper who left a four star review?  However, seeing the film twice now and watching the extra features contained on this DVD last night, I felt the need to chime in and say that this is absolutely a perfect documentary on one of the best bands of all time.The basics of any good rock documentary are all contained here -- the beginnings of the band, the struggle, the success, the influence on other well-respected musicians, the legacy, etc.  However, at the core of this film and the story of Rush in general is friendship.  What a rarity for a rock band with this long of a career!  Anyone who has seen or read interviews with Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson or Neil Peart over the years knows that these are three individuals that truly like one another, but it really comes across quite beautifully in this film.  Whether it's the scenes of Lee & Lifeson going back to their junior high school and recalling how they took most of their classes together, or if it's the emotional segment of the film discussing Neil Peart's personal tragedies -- you just know that these three guys love one another and that comes before the band.  It almost seems like acrimony goes hand in hand with the biggest bands of all time -- The Beatles, Yes, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, the aborted Zep reunion from a few years back, and the list goes on.  For some reason tho, this has not happened with Rush.  And it may simply come down to that these are three very nice, level-headed gentlemen.  That just also happen to f**king rock.Anyway this documentary is perfect.  The bonus features are also great, with particular highlights being Geddy Lee's frank discussion on the recording ofHemispheres(probably my favorite Rush album, but seemingly a sore spot for the band) and footage of Lee, Lifeson, and Peart enjoying a dinner together over many bottles of wine.

1347250,A28TXEQKNBE6BS,B003J27WFW,Kindle Customer,"[0, 0]","For me, the best thing about this film is that it shows three normal guys who just happen to be amazing musicians. A three-piece band that sounds better than some of the bands out there who sport six members.The beginning roots of the band was interesting, and also all the crap they had to deal with from critics. In the end, their music speaks much louder than any half-baked rock critic who just couldn't understand the band. Also, the 2112 period where they talked about this, and how it was a battle cry against people who wanted them to not do their own thing. They basically wanted Rush to sell out, and their answer was 2112. Excellent answer.But the part that's probably talked about the most is, the section dealing with Neil Peart's personal losses, and how the other two guys in the band waited for him to heal. Most bands would have been stupid enough to actually try and replace a person who many consider to be the most talented drummer in the world. But Geddy and Alex stuck by him and waited it out. The end result was Vapor Trails, and a tour that got these guys back on stage.Even if you are just a casual Rush listener, do yourself a favor and check this DVD out.

1347255,A1RP0XAYQEEMDM,B003J27WFW,"M. Curtis ""Dr. Zaius""","[2, 2]","""Rush Beyond the Lighted Stage"" is a very well made and entertaining documentary.  The interviews with the band's members are very well done and informative.  Being a Rush fan for close to three decades I was not disappointed.  I especially liked seeing such extensive interviews with drummer Neil Peart.  It was wonderful seeing the very private and anti-social man break his silence and open up to his legions of fans.  It was very nice to see him so relaxed in those interviews given the fact that he is very uncomfortable giving them.The producers of the documentary do a very good job with laying out the story of the band.  From their humble beginnings in Willowdale Canada to their first live performances with original drummer the late John Rutsey to their American debut.  The interviews with the band's management and producers add to the entertainment value of this documentary.  The interviews are very insightful and do a good job advancing the story.I very much enjoyed listening to how the band's musical style has evolved over the years.  What I especially enjoyed is how they stood up to their record company when they were told to make drastic changes in their style after the disappointing sales of ""Caress of Steel"".  That segment showed very well how much they band loves what they do and were determined to keep their style of music their own no matter what the cost.By far the best part of the documentary is the part that shows how Neil dealt with the horrible personal tragedies in his life in 1997 and 98.  The interviews with Neil were just amazing.  You can feel the emotion coming through the screen as he described his travels on his journey of healing.  What was also just as good was the interviews with Geddy and Alex as well as the band's manager.  The sadness they felt for their colleague and good friend is just as emotional.  What is especially commendable is that everybody respected Neil's wishes and allowed him to take as much time as he needed to recover from the tragedies (If he would ever completely recover is unlikely and that is perfectly understandable.) without any concern for Rush or music for that matter.  The segment ends perfectly with footage of the band's first live performance since Neil's return on the Vapor Trails tour.The documentary concludes with terrific footage of Rush together in a small resturant.  You can clearly see how true their friendship is and despite describing themselves as goofy and odd, they really are just three good guys who love each other and what they do.The only criticism I have is that I think the documentary focused too much on interviews with other musicans and celebrities and their adulation for the band.  I understand the reason for having the interviews because it shows the impact Rush has had, but I think it was a little too much.  Especially Jack Black singing a few bars of ""The Spirit of Radio.""  I could have done without that.However this is just a small flaw in an otherwise very well made documentary.  It is well worth seeing.",4,"A Great, But Not Perfect, Documentary",1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,3039,"['Rush', 'Beyond', 'Lighted', 'Stage', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'informative', 'Being', 'Rush', 'fan', 'close', 'three', 'decades', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'especially', 'liked', 'seeing', 'such', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'drummer', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'was', 'wonderful', 'seeing', 'very', 'private', 'anti-social', 'man', 'break', 'silence', 'open', 'up', 'legions', 'fans', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'see', 'so', 'relaxed', 'interviews', 'given', 'fact', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'giving', 'them.The', 'producers', 'documentary', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'laying', 'out', 'story', 'band', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'Willowdale', 'Canada', 'first', 'live', 'performances', 'original', 'drummer', 'late', 'John', 'Rutsey', 'American', 'debut', 'interviews', 'band', 'management', 'producers', 'add', 'entertainment', 'value', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'are', 'very', 'insightful', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'advancing', 'story.I', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'how', 'band', 'musical', 'style', 'evolved', 'years', 'What', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'stood', 'up', 'record', 'company', 'when', 'were', 'told', 'make', 'drastic', 'changes', 'style', 'disappointing', 'sales', 'Caress', 'Steel', 'segment', 'showed', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'much', 'band', 'what', 'do', 'were', 'determined', 'keep', 'style', 'music', 'own', 'matter', 'what', 'cost.By', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'documentary', 'part', 'how', 'Neil', 'horrible', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'life', '1997', '98', 'interviews', 'Neil', 'were', 'just', 'amazing', 'can', 'feel', 'emotion', 'coming', 'screen', 'described', 'travels', 'journey', 'healing', 'What', 'was', 'also', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'interviews', 'Geddy', 'Alex', 'as', 'well', 'band', 'manager', 'sadness', 'felt', 'colleague', 'good', 'friend', 'just', 'emotional', 'What', 'especially', 'commendable', 'everybody', 'respected', 'Neil', 'wishes', 'allowed', 'take', 'much', 'time', 'needed', 'recover', 'tragedies', 'would', 'ever', 'completely', 'recover', 'unlikely', 'perfectly', 'understandable', 'concern', 'Rush', 'music', 'matter', 'segment', 'perfectly', 'footage', 'band', 'first', 'live', 'performance', 'Neil', 'return', 'Vapor', 'Trails', 'tour.The', 'documentary', 'concludes', 'terrific', 'footage', 'Rush', 'together', 'small', 'resturant', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'how', 'true', 'friendship', 'describing', 'goofy', 'odd', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'three', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'what', 'do.The', 'only', 'criticism', 'have', 'think', 'documentary', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'interviews', 'other', 'musicans', 'celebrities', 'adulation', 'band', 'understand', 'reason', 'having', 'interviews', 'impact', 'Rush', 'had', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Especially', 'Jack', 'Black', 'singing', 'few', 'bars', 'Spirit', 'Radio', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'that.However', 'just', 'small', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage

1347258,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B003J27WFW,Monkdude,"[2, 2]","Sure they've had some hit songs that still get radio play to this day, but Rush has always been a band that just hangs on the outer reaches of fame and popularity. Critics never got them, as you'll see here, and they are still left out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After watching this documentary, the reason is quite simple. They play what they want and could care less about what anyone thinks. As a listener, you either get it or you don't. The musicianship is incredible of course, especially knowing that all that depth and skill is coming from only three guys. I've seen them twice in concert (2002 and 2007) and own two of their live DVDs, so I would consider myself a middle level fan.Rush: Beyond the Lighted stage goes into the band's history from the very beginning all the way up to present day. There is some neat old footage of the guys playing at high schools in the late 60's and very early 70's, as well as, an interesting argument with guitarist, Alex Lifeson, around the age of 16, telling his parents he's quitting school to pursue his music career. I don't know who would be filming a conversation like this, especially back them, when everything that happened in your life wasn't posted on the web. It also explores the death of Neil Peart's wife and daughter, which led to his disappearance that went on for years as he traveled the world on his own.Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson are very likeable and provide most of the humor, but I was also interested in the quiet and often camera shy Neil Peart. Other than being one of the greatest rock drummers ever, he seems like a smart fellow, but also vastly different than the other two guys. They are the ones who interact with the fans at the meet and greets, while Neil Peart's social awkwardness keeps him behind closed doors.There are also several other artists that talk about the influence of Rush on them, ranging from Kirk Hammett and Billy Corgan, all the way to Jack Black.If you are a fan of Rush on any level this is a must see.

1347259,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,B003J27WFW,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[1, 1]","I've been a Rush fan since I first heard 'All The World's A Stage' Rush's first live album in 1976. Even though it took some getting used to Geddy's vocals, I always knew these guys could play their A $$'s off! There are probably only two groups left on the planet that I buy their new albums without hesitation one being The Rolling Stones and the other of course Rush. While the Stones haven't put out a great album in a long time, I still find their new offerings interesting.Rush on the other hand has delivered great album after great album, but even these musical giants have had their moments were they didn't top their last effort. For me I feel that the band continued to grow up to 'Hold Your Fire'. That doesn't mean that it's my favorite album, but there was a gradual climb to that point. When 'Presto' was released it marked the first time the band sounded like they went backwards...I know now that this was intentional. After 'Roll The Bones' the band started to dig in and really grow again with some of the newest albums technically amazing, but lacking in melody. I still love and own all of their albums and have nothing but the greatest respect for these stellar musicians and songwriters.I'm giving a little back history here because now with 'Rush Beyond The Lighted Stage' I get to hear what I've known for years from the guys who have influenced me and countless other musicians to play a little harder and I get to hear a lot of stuff that I didn't know about. While I and every other Rush fan would have liked this documentary to go on for hours, I think it is really well put together even though it should have been at least another 45 minutes longer.I can understand why this film is 106 minutes, but considering the fan base, I can't believe that the members of Rush didn't realize that Rush fans would want a much longer in depth look at the band's History. The early years are well done, but it seems to ""rush"" by the later years and even though the film is really quite good, I think with a little more effort, it could have been the definitive documentary all Rush fans were looking for.The Blu Ray has all of the extras that are on the two discs DVD, but to be honest, with all the early footage used in this piece, there is really little reason to buy the Blu Ray over the standard DVD as visual quality is really not all that much better. The small segments in HD will look fine on standard and the old stuff might even look a little better. If you don't own a Blu Ray player this is certainly not the reason to go and buy one.I rate the documentary itself 4 1/2 stars and the extras 5 stars for some very cool old concert footage with John Rutsey and other obscurities. Most of the other extras are mostly made up of segments that appear in the film as clips, are presented here more elaborately.

1347260,AUHZ4NEDBKM1X,B003J27WFW,NEOPROG RAN,"[0, 0]",This was a welcome history/documentary of Rush that was both entertaining and informative. I like the part where they talk about Hine producing Presto- I wish he would produce another one of their albums. Nice bonus DVD in which they include some concert footage. My favorite was the song from Counterparts(one of the few songs that I actually like from that album) dedicated to Entwistle. I almost docked a star for the negative portrayal of their mid 80s albums. I loved these albums and I truly believe that Rush was one of the few bands at that time that continued being progressive. Their personalities are certainly revealed. Geddy likes baseball like me so that's cool and he seems to be a down to earth kind of guy.  Alex is funny and Neil's kind of a loner.

A solid, fun and warmly personal documentary about my long-time favorite band is about the greatest thing I can experience on a screen.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this film takes you from the band's humble beginnings in the early 1970s through their years of heavy prog-rock, to the peak of pop success in the early 1980s, finally leaving off with the band members as the elder statesman of rock n roll that they are now.  The story is engaging, sometimes very funny and always very revealing, making this band even more likeable than they already were (if that's possible).  It's a fan's dream.  I saw it in the theater with my best friend, who is the biggest Rush fan I have ever met, and the audience consisted of a bunch of guys (very few women in attendance) aged 30 and up.  The members of San Diego band Pinback were in attendance as well, and I got a chance to chat with them briefly at the end of the show as well (they were a local favorite of mine when I lived in San Diego).All that said, just because I am a huge Rush fan and had this sort of man-cave-ish experience with the film doesn't mean that you necessarily won't like it if you aren't: a) a huge Rush fan; or b) male and middle-aged.  The fact is, this is at its core just a great story about 3 good friends who managed to somehow defy all odds and their own expectations to become one of the world's biggest and most artistically honest rock n roll acts.  The events that took place follow them through decades of cultural change, from the 1960s to the present.  I can honestly say that even if I had not much in the way of prior knowledge about Rush there would still be enough here to hold my attention.  That is the mark of great documentary filmmaking.So whether or not you are a Rush fan, this might just be worth your time.

I don't mean, hey, if you ever get a chance to see it and you've got free time, check it out.  I mean:  drop everything you're doing and see this RIGHT NOW!If you're not a fan, I still believe this would be an entertaining movie that you'd find to be a very interesting look at a band that somehow has stayed around and kept its fans happy for nearly 40 years.  But unless you're married to a fan (like me wife, who watched and liked this), there isn't a hugely compelling reason to watch.But I'll say again, if you're a fan, this film is like a gift from on high.  A well-crafted tribute to the band.  No effort to be impartial...it is a love letter to Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart.  Many musicians, including Les Claypool, Kirk Hammet, Trent Reznor, Jack Black and Billy Corgin jump in with their thoughts on the band...but mostly it is a chronological look at the long career of this group...from birth to their 2008 Snakes & Arrows tour.  And our guides through most of it are the 3 members of the band...which is great, because the members of Rush, particularly drummer Neil Peart, are very private people and don't really grant a great many interviews.Their story is interesting, but hardly earth-shattering.  What is so great is the sense that you're getting to know these 3 musicians on a personal level...for the first time.  We see them interact together and there is no doubt as to their deep friendship.  Particularly worthwhile is seeing the bond between Alex Lifeson & Geddy Lee.  Friends since age 12, it's a delight to see how much they clearly still care for each other and can still make each other laugh.  They are like an old, happily-married couple.  (And before you jump to conclusions, we also see that they are both caring family men with very non-rock star-like values.)The film also doesn't shy away from introducing us to the more elusive Neil Peart.  Notoriously shy and publicity adverse, the film allows the band to discuss the impression that Peart is a jerk.  It also gives us the deepest glimpse I've yet seen into the dark time in Peart's life, when he lost his teenage daughter in a car accident and his wife a few months later to cancer.  It's hard not to be moved by the tentative disclosures we get of the clearly deep emotions these three men felt.But the film is also hilarious, because these guys are not shy in joking about the absolutely ridiculous clothes they wore and the fact that they never had groupies.  They have been so successful in their lives that they clearly have no problem poking fun at themselves.  They aren't exactly humble, but they ARE humble about things that are of little consequence.  And they sure are serious about the music.  We get a sense of their struggles to avoid caving in to the demands of their record labels.  And we see how their musical journey never ends.The DVD has MANY bonus features that are also a treat.

1347274,A2JCGI5QI9FIBD,B003J27WFW,"R. Short ""robertsathard""","[3, 3]","Upon hearing that my favorite band Rush was going to be the subject of a documentary I feared that the project would be some shoddy job thrown together by overzealous fans.  I am happy to report that I couldn't have been more wrong.  ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" is a treat for non-fans of the band and a must own for the fans.Part of the appeal of this documentary is the praises the band receives from the likes of Gene Simmons, Trent Reznor, Kirk Hammet, Billy Corgin, and many others.  Producers such as Terry Brown, Peter Collins, and Rupert Hine also provide insight into many of the band's recordings.  It would have nice to including an interview with Peter Henderson on the nightmare session that became ""Grace Under Pressure"".The real stars of the documentary of course are the band members themselves:  Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and the elusive Neil Peart.  The band shares many stories throughout the year as a band, none of the boring.  One of the best moments is a young Alex Lifeson caught on film telling his family he is dropping out of school to become a full time musician much to his parents horror.  Alex's face displays that of total defiance.If there is anything this documentary lacks it's pretense.  The band is honest, almost brutally at some points.  They don't come across as guys who are using music as a way to change the world or to promote some cause.  They come across as a trio of musicians who write music they enjoy and hope others enjoy it also.  Also, even though Geddy and Alex are willing to meet fans from time to time Neil Peart is honest in stating he would rather not do this.  After watching some of the fans in the interviews I can't say I blame him.The supplementary material on this release is really nice.  I am sure fans will enjoy some of the rare live footage of the band including a 1978 performance of ""La Villa Strangiato"".  But the biggest thrill here is the camera captures Geddy, Alex, and having dinner, just being three ordinary guys, cutting up, having fun, and discussing future Rush projects.",5,A Must Own For Fans - A Treat For Non Fans,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,2052,"['hearing', 'favorite', 'band', 'Rush', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'subject', 'documentary', 'feared', 'project', 'would', 'be', 'shoddy', 'job', 'thrown', 'together', 'overzealous', 'fans', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'Lighted', 'Stage', 'treat', 'non-fans', 'band', 'must', 'own', 'fans.Part', 'appeal', 'documentary', 'praises', 'band', 'likes', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'Trent', 'Reznor', 'Kirk', 'Hammet', 'Billy', 'Corgin', 'many', 'others', 'Producers', 'such', 'Terry', 'Brown', 'Peter', 'Collins', 'Rupert', 'Hine', 'also', 'provide', 'insight', 'many', 'band', 'recordings', 'would', 'have', 'nice', 'including', 'interview', 'Peter', 'Henderson', 'nightmare', 'session', 'became', 'Grace', 'Pressure', '.The', 'real', 'stars', 'documentary', 'course', 'are', 'band', 'members', 'Geddy', 'Lee', 'Alex', 'Lifeson', 'elusive', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'band', 'shares', 'many', 'stories', 'year', 'band', 'none', 'boring', 'One', 'best', 'moments', 'young', 'Alex', 'Lifeson', 'caught', 'film', 'telling', 'family', 'dropping', 'school', 'become', 'full', 'time', 'musician', 'much', 'parents', 'horror', 'Alex', 'face', 'total', 'defiance.If', 'anything', 'documentary', 'pretense', 'band', 'honest', 'almost', 'brutally', 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'using', 'music', 'way', 'change', 'world', 'promote', 'cause', 'come', 'trio', 'musicians', 'who', 'write', 'music', 'enjoy', 'hope', 'others', 'enjoy', 'also', 'Also', 'even', 'Geddy', 'Alex', 'are', 'willing', 'meet', 'fans', 'time', 'time', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'honest', 'stating', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'do', 'watching', 'fans', 'interviews', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'blame', 'him.The', 'supplementary', 'material', 'release', 'really', 'nice', 'am', 'sure', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'rare', 'live', 'footage', 'band', 'including', '1978', 'performance', 'La', 'Villa', 'Strangiato', 'biggest', 'thrill', 'here', 'camera', 'Geddy', 'Alex', 'having', 'dinner', 'just', 'being', 'three', 'ordinary', 'guys', 'cutting', 'up', 'having', 'fun', 'discussing', 'future', 'Rush', 'projects']",Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage

I found out a lot about how the band started that was new to me, and they had some very good quality footage of things like a teenaged Alex arguing with his parents over his decision to drop out of school and pursue music.

1347276,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B003J27WFW,Sky,"[3, 3]","Back in 1977 a friend of mine said that I've just got to hear this new live album by the band called Rush. At the time I was probably the biggest Rainbow fan on Earth and I was totally into their new live album calledOn Stage. In my opinion there couldn't possibly be anything better than the combined talents of Ronnie James Dio, Ritchie Blackmore and Cozy Powell blastin' out A Light in the Black or Kill the King. I had heard of Rush, but I never really gave them a listen because I was told that it was bad Progressive Rock with a singer that sounded like he'd just inhaled helium.So over to my friend's house I went after school on that day in 1977, thinking more about indulging in some of his fine Columbian versus listening tothis new Rush album. And it was that day that turned my Rock & Roll world upside down...and not because of the Columbian. I was absolutely captivated by what I was hearing from ""Hello would you please welcome home..Rush!"" to ""Thank you. Good night!"" And furthermore, as a drummer, I'd never heard playing like what I heard Neil Peart doing on the album. The next day I went out and bought Rush's first four studio albums, All the World's a Stage and was excited to learn that a fifth calledFarewell to Kingswould be released in weeks.Why the background story? Because I would say that most of Beyond the Lighted Stage is devoted to describing Rush's exploits during the same time period that I became a fan. I'd say 75% of the documentary covers Rush's experiences from the mid 70s through the early 80s. And to me, those are the golden years of Rush. I know that there's a world of fans that continued to be big fans of Rush's ""new material"" from the mid 80s right up until the current day, but I will always view the disks up throughMoving Picturesas what shaped me musically and as a musician.Ironically, Beyond the Lighted Stage doesn't even make a mention of All the World's a Stage, but this DVD does an outstanding job of telling the story of Rush's formation, through their early days of getting signed with original drummer John Rutsey, through hiring ""The New Guy"", through making some of the absolute greatest recordings in Rock & Roll history. There's some unbelievable video in this documentary, and not just of the band playing together in their early years; I mean of candid moments behind the scenes with the band. In today's world it's not unusual to capture everything on video, but back in the 70s? What would be the chances of having video of the day that you announced to your parents that you're dropping out of high school to pursue your musical career?The main documentary is about an hour and 30 minutes long, and then there's like another hour and 30 minutes of bonus features that includes stuff that just didn't make it into the final cut of the documentary for whatever reason, some rare performance footage and some other fun stuff like pre-gig warm-up routines. By the end of watching all 3 hours of the DVD, I felt like I really knew these guys. Since that day that I heard All the World's a Stage in 1977, Rush has always been close to the heart, but now they're even Closer to the Heart.There is no question here...if you are a Rush fan add this to your cart. And if you don't own one of Rush's current live DVD's, pick one of those up too, because after watching Beyond the Lighted Stage you'll still be craving more.

Sam Dunn & Scot McFadyen are the same filmmakers behind the similarly awesome Iron Maiden docFlight 666. ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" is one of the better career-spanning documentaries I've seen. I like Rush, but kind of lost touch with them after 1987's ""Hold Your Fire."" This film makes me want to go back and hear what I've missed.For all the hipsters who have dismissed Rush over the years, it's awesome to see Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins), Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), Kirk Hammet (Metallica), Taylor Hawkins (Foo Fighters) and Tim Commeford (Rage Against The Machine) singing the band's praises.""R:BTLS"" gives even a casual viewer a dynamite glimpse into the life of this band that's been together since '68 and putting out albums since '74. In many ways, this film would make a great double feature withAnvil: The Story of Anvil. Both bands that have been doing it their way for decades. Rush made it, Anvil didn't.""R:BTLS"" doesn't shy away from subjects like the tragic auto accident that took Neal Peart's daughter, or the subsequent death of his wife. As other reviewers have noted, that section of the movie is the emotional core of the whole film. Dunn and McFadyen are fans, but they're not afraid to ask why has Rush been marginalized and critically attacked over the years. They also spend time exploring Peart's aversion to meeting devoted fans.I was really drawn into this film. No mean feat, considering this is not a story brimming with acrimony, drugs, groupies and all the other usual ""watching a train wreck"" staples of, say, ""Behind The Music."" A band, the people around them, folks they've influenced, and their fans. And that's all that's needed for a compelling story.Bottom line:Just a film fan? 4 solid stars.

1347279,A3JDK2RUAXXK3P,B003J27WFW,Steverino,"[3, 10]","What's interesting is that I am ABSOLUTE Rush fan, yet this film only proved to me what I have suspected about some of the guys in the band for a LONG TIME....  For starters, Geddy is pretty full of himself. One particular comment was about how ""simple"" other bands' music is. What he's trying to say here is that VERY FEW bands are on the ""virtuoso"" level of Rush's playing. That may very well have been true in the past, but when you listen to Dream Theater, well, so much for THAT opinion.I've always seen Peart's leaving the band on his ""soul searching"" bike ride as entirely self-indulgent - and this story cemented that aspect. Sure, you want to grieve over losing your family members, but FIVE YEARS...???  Just proves how much he loved his bandmates by making them sit by for half a decade waiting for him to decide if he ""still wants to play drums"". The excuse that he ""does not handle fans well"" that was emphasized in the film, and how Alex and Geddy have to do all the palm-pressing events with fans, sounds just like an EXCUSE to me. I mean, the man is a friggin' AWESOME drummer and a hell of a lyricist, but he ain't no GOD..... And that's the way he comes off to me in this film.As far as I'm concerned, ""Hemispheres"" was their ABSOLUTE ZENITH, musically and creatively. There were a couple decent albums after that, but after Moving Pictures, the band took some (again, self-indulgent) strange directions and let their (then) current producer toy with their sound and make the synthesizers the focal point of the music and not the guitar. HUGE mistake and one that cost them my loyalty, and many other true fans of the band as well. After you've written something like Hemispheres, why in the world would you want to go back down levels to playing drivel....??  Funny how Peart admits in the film ""After we wrote Hemispheres we decided that was the LAST time we were going to do an album LIKE THAT...""  Hmmmmm....  What does THAT MEAN, exactly?Why would three intelligent men distance themselves so ardently from their finest work..?  One has to wonder sometimes about peoples minds. I for one was never sadder to lose the ""progressive Rush"", a band that paved new roads with excellently played, yet melodic arrangements, and odd (yet palatable) time signatures that so perfectly complimented the music.I know I'll probably get flack for my unflattering opinion of a band so highly regarded, but I'm just calling it as I see it.I play my ""old"" Rush over and over again and as a bass player, I believe myself to be more in tune with their music and what they stood for than the average person. I'll just have to be satisfied that - at least for a brief, shining moment - these three guys shined brighter than most of us mere mortals.Bravo ""Hemispheres""!",4,"Excellent DVD, flawed band members...",1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,2769,"['What', 'interesting', 'am', 'ABSOLUTE', 'Rush', 'fan', 'yet', 'film', 'only', 'proved', 'what', 'have', 'suspected', 'guys', 'band', 'LONG', 'TIME', 'starters', 'Geddy', 'pretty', 'full', 'One', 'particular', 'comment', 'was', 'how', 'simple', 'other', 'bands', 'music', 'What', 'trying', 'say', 'here', 'VERY', 'FEW', 'bands', 'are', 'virtuoso', 'level', 'Rush', 'playing', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'past', 'when', 'listen', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'opinion.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'seen', 'Peart', 'leaving', 'band', 'soul', 'searching', 'bike', 'ride', 'entirely', 'self-indulgent', 'story', 'cemented', 'aspect', 'Sure', 'want', 'grieve', 'losing', 'family', 'members', 'FIVE', 'YEARS', 'Just', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'bandmates', 'making', 'sit', 'decade', 'waiting', 'decide', 'still', 'play', 'drums', 'excuse', 'not', 'handle', 'fans', 'well', 'was', 'emphasized', 'film', 'how', 'Alex', 'Geddy', 'have', 'do', 'palm-pressing', 'events', 'fans', 'just', 'EXCUSE', 'mean', 'man', 'friggin', 'AWESOME', 'drummer', 'hell', 'lyricist', 'ai', ""n't"", 'GOD', '..', 'way', 'film.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Hemispheres', 'was', 'ABSOLUTE', 'ZENITH', 'musically', 'creatively', 'were', 'couple', 'decent', 'albums', 'Moving', 'Pictures', 'band', 'took', 'again', 'self-indulgent', 'strange', 'directions', 'let', 'then', 'current', 'producer', 'toy', 'sound', 'make', 'synthesizers', 'focal', 'point', 'music', 'not', 'guitar', 'HUGE', 'mistake', 'one', 'cost', 'loyalty', 'many', 'other', 'true', 'fans', 'band', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'written', 'something', 'Hemispheres', 'why', 'world', 'would', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'down', 'levels', 'playing', 'drivel', 'Funny', 'how', 'Peart', 'film', 'wrote', 'Hemispheres', 'decided', 'was', 'LAST', 'time', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'album', 'Hmmmmm', 'What', 'MEAN', 'exactly', 'Why', 'would', 'three', 'intelligent', 'men', 'distance', 'so', 'ardently', 'finest', 'work..', 'One', 'wonder', 'sometimes', 'peoples', 'minds', 'one', 'was', 'never', 'sadder', 'lose', 'progressive', 'Rush', 'band', 'paved', 'new', 'roads', 'excellently', 'played', 'yet', 'melodic', 'arrangements', 'odd', 'yet', 'palatable', 'time', 'so', 'perfectly', 'complimented', 'music.I', 'know', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'flack', 'unflattering', 'opinion', 'band', 'so', 'highly', 'regarded', ""'m"", 'just', 'calling', 'see', 'it.I', 'play', 'old', 'Rush', 'over', 'again', 'bass', 'player', 'believe', 'be', 'more', 'tune', 'music', 'what', 'stood', 'average', 'person', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'be', 'satisfied', 'least', 'brief', 'shining', 'moment', 'three', 'guys', 'shined', 'brighter', 'most', 'mere', 'mortals.Bravo', 'Hemispheres']",Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage
1347280,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B003J27WFW,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[3, 4]","I've been a Rush fan for most of my life, but since I've not been an avid all-time Rush fan, I've often missed what the band means to me. I go through Rush phases, particularly when they have an interesting new CD/DVD set, but I don't listen to them all the time any more.I recently borrowed from a friend Beyond The Lighted Stage, the 2010 Rush documentary by Scot MacFayden and Sam Dunn (the directors of ""Metal: A Headbangers Journey"", ""Global Metal"" and the ""Flight 666' Iron Maiden documentary; Scot, apparently, grew up not far from me and went to high school with close friends of mine) because I had to experience for myself this incredible rock `n' roll journey by one of the most long-lasting bands around (only the Stones have existed longer as a unit, but with more lineup changes). It's been the same three guys since 1975, although Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee have been playing in bands since 1968.The key themes of the movie are, of course, friendship, musicianship, development, passion, and (bad) fashion. It charts the history of the band, with key moments being when the directors bring the members of Rush back to the places where they started out - the church, where they played their first gig, they return to for the first time since they played there in 1968.The films starts off with scenes of the band warming up, of Neil throwing a drumstick into the air and then dropping it (rare - how often would that happen?) and then goes quickly into celebrity interviews: Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater, Kirk Hammett of Metallica (who couldn't believe that the band could produce so much sound with only three members when he first heard them), Tim Commerford of Rage Against The Machine, Jason McGem of Death Cab For Cutie, Vinnie Paul of Pantera, Zakk Wylde, Les Claypool of Primus, Dana Carey of Tool, Matt Stone of South Park, Taylor Hawkings of Foo FIghters, Jimmy Chamberlin of Smashing Pumpkins, Sebastian Bach of Skid Row (who claims to be Member #3 of some Toronto-based Rush fan group), Jack Black (who gives multiple funny speeches, such as the one about rock sauce), Gene Simmons (""There's no other way to describe Rush than just... Rush.""), and Billy Corgan, who notes that the Beatles and the Stones (the only other bands Rush can be compared with) have been over-explained... but not Rush.But hey - where's Marilyn Manson?The film goes into historical mode, explaining that the parents of Geddy Lee (nee Gary Lee Weinrib) were both Polish Holocaust survivors (here's where the similarities to Robb Reiner, the drummer of Anvil, and a key player in the other great Canadian rock `n' roll documentary, come in) who relocated to Willowdale, a suburb of Toronto, where they were one of the first Jewish families. Geddy's dad died when he was 12, meaning that he had to go into 11 months of mourning. Geddy's mom, Mary Weinrib, talked about Geddy as a kid (the nickname/stage name ""Geddy"" came from her pronunciation of Gary through her thick Polish accent; he's since had his name legally changed to Geddy). The story covers how Geddy met Alex Lifeson in high school, there are plenty of cool pictures of Geddy and Alex as young shorthairs together in school (incidentally, Rick Moranis was their classmate, a fact that probably led to their collaboration with Geddy on ""Take Off"", the hit single of the Bob And Doug MacKenzie  album ""The Great White North"").Alex seems to have had a relatively steady upbringing, his parents both having immigrated from Yugoslavia, dad had been in a prison camp. The film interviews his mom, Melanija Zivojinovich. Both kids got guitars from their moms, Alex was promised his if he brought home good grades, which was no problem as he was a teacher's pet and was a master schmoozer. Geddy and Alex shared the same grade nine homeroom. First gig was in a church basement in September 1968, the drop-in centre called The Coffin, they got $10, having played to 35 kids, went to eat at Panzer's Deli. Scenes of Sam The Record Man and A&A; Records on Yonge Street, discussion of the Yorkville scene (see also Neil Young's Archives 1), and the local hit band The Poppers. Ray Danniels got them as a manager, saw them as talented 16-year-olds who could play a high school circuit with drummer John Rutsey (1953-2008). Pic of three of them in their undies, very early footage, nice red and white star shirt, playing in basement. Alex quit school in grade 12, there's a high quality video of him talking to his parents about his decision, sitting with a girlfriend at the kitchen table talking about it - it looks staged, but that is because it is from a 1972 scare movie about teen pregnancy and school-leavers called ""Come On Children"" from 1972).There had been a turning point in the Toronto band scene in 1971 when the drinking age was dropped to 18. Yorkville's cafes, hippy and revolutionary, were shut down, and good-time rock `n' roll was encouraged for a rockin' younger drinking crowd. The film quotes famous Canadian musician Kim Mitchell talking about the scene. Rush was playing six nights a week, at places like Abbey Road pub. ""Garden Road"", a never-released song from that era, is played in the movie. The band put together their own first album, and it was heard in the US, where it got attention. ""Rush"" was the perfect album for Cleveland in 1974, especially songs like ""Working Man"", which resonated with many Clevelanders (is it a coincidence that their new live CD ""Time Machine"" was recorded there?). The phones lit up with people calling in to ask for the record, thinking it was the new Led Zeppelin release. There was no record industry in Canada at that time, only outposts. John Rutsey was more into Bad Company, Geddy and Alex were into Yes and Genesis and Pink Floyd. John not healthy enough to tour, would have been okay for the home circuit. So, with a US tour coming up, they looked for a new drummer.Neil Peart was from a farm in Hayville, cursed by skating on ankles, learned to knit because it was a challenge, suffered physical abuse in the smoking area as a result of being a bit weird and growing his hair longish. Drumming became an instrument of self esteem. The footage shows both parents, who were supportive of his career in music. Was in a band called JR Flood, playing the double bass drum even then. Dad encouraged Neil to audition for Rush in Ajax. Geddy thought Neil was goofy, Alex thought he was not cool enough for Rush. Then he played... ""He was so good!"" Mullet man. First tour was opening for Manfred Mann and Uriah Heep. Mick Box of Uriah Heap loved them.  Eleven days on, one day off, brutal schedule. The film shows posters of their bills with the New York Dolls, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, Rory Gallagher, Rod Stewart and the Faces, Montrose, KISS (who loved them, playing 50-60 shows together - the two bands got close). Geddy says that there was no harder working band then KISS, he said it was ""fun to watch their hotel"". Two-band pic with big ""happy birthday"" cake, KISS in make-up, Rush just in jeans. Kim Mitchell's story about the lady's bowling league staying on the same floor as Rush and partying harder than these boys. Neil very literate, opinionated, weird, serious, always the new guy, buying a lot of books, a reader. The band worked on songs after shows. ""By-Tor"" the start of thematic stuff. Audiences got smaller and smaller, toured with Ted Nugent on Caress of Steel when he was also a small act, depressing tour. The discussion of 2112 begins at 37-minute mark of the DVD, the band says that they felt at the time that 2112 may have been their last hurrah, despite pressure to become a rock/pop band, they were determined to go out guns blazing.Billy Corgan describes how he once could play all of Side 1 of 2112, the release also encouraged a 12-year old Sebastian Bach to go out and buy Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead, to which the LP had been dedicated. ""2112 bought us our independence,"" they realised (""We have assumed control"", the final words of Side 1 of 2112 really carry new meaning!). Critics hated it. ""Unintentionally funny."" ""A cancerous network of haphazard key and time signature changes."" ""Smug, hypocritical, pseudo-symbolic drivel."" ""Flagrantly derivative music."" Constant insults from media, but not from fans. ""Best band in the galaxy"" the posters at shows said, with the 2112 back patch on thousands of jean jackets. A people's band. Canadian VJ JD Roberts gives his comments, now and also from '80s footage. No fashion clue. In San Francisco they found kimonos. First UK tour, where they actually charted!  Nice shots of a Hammersmith Odeon marquee, Rush with Max Webster opening. Geddy and Alex at this point both with double-necked guitars (SG and Rickenbacher). UFO made fun of them - furry slippers nailed to the stage, calling Geddy ""Glee"" (oh how ironic now). With ""Hemispheres"" they embraced long songs, recorded in Wales, experimenting. Determined to record La Villa Strangiata in one take. The song made a huge impression on Kirk Hammet, who called them the high priests of conceptual metal (a title, I suppose that Metallica now owns, having become a less rockin' band than Rush now is, a poor man's Rush of sorts). Various musicians explain that Rush was a musician's benchmark of sorts - if you could recreate Rush, you would be ready for anything. Jack Black explains meeting the band, first Alex and Geddy, then... the master, who is ""eerily precise. If you went in with a computer, Neil Peart would be right on the beat to an atom."" The band played 200 concerts a year, and at one point 17 one-nighters in a row.Babies started to arrive, the band felt that they couldn't be selfish any more, and began recording bringing the family closer to the process. But they had their biggest successes in front of them. The band is very family-oriented - Alex married in his teens and had kids early, he introduced Geddy to his wife. Cool pic of Neil wearing an FM t-shirt. Permanent Waves was an important stepping stone, there would have been no Moving Pictures without Permanent Waves. Hemispheres was recorded in La Studio, a happy time with family. Concert audiences doubled with 2112, the band shifted from a theatre band at the start of the tour to doing stadium gigs at the end. Three nights at Maple Leaf Gardens. ""Moving Pictures"" made them what they are, Neil said that it was a mixed blessing, strange people came out of the woodwork. There's a scene of a fan approaching Alex and Geddy in a cafe that brought tears to my eyes, I was sniffing and near-blubbering - I started wondering what thoughts would come to my mind, what overflowing emotions would come unbottled, if I came across Alex and Geddy somehow, somewhere the way this waitress did when they wandered into her establishment (which, I think, is Pedro's, the spot where Panzer's Deli had once been, as shown in the outtakes section). And, oddly enough, I think that the last two times that I was overcome by emotion, Rush was involved (the R30 DVD, and also buying Alex Lifeson's ""Limelight"" instructional video). Neil struggles around fans, not comfortable. Fans are so different, hardcore fans of old, male, very intense. Billy Corgan recounts tale of playing ""Entre Nous"" to his mom, as a way to reach out to her. Jack Black: ""They had honesty and integrity, which was in short supply."" Christopher Schreberger, fan (yes, they interviewed fans for this DVD too, but only a few), noted that ""Subdivisions"" really related to him... because he lived in a subdivision (ooohhh... aaaahhhh). Terry Date was the fourth member of Rush. Peter Colilns, a pop producer, was brought in for the next album, ""Grace Under Pressure"". Neil: ""No protective nature of what Rush was."" Alex"" ""Hard to work with keyboards on Power windows."" Geddy: Hold Your Fire pushed them far away from Rush. Rupert Hine brought them back to power trio mode. Counterparts had more hair on it.  Neil worked with Freddie Gruber on jazz drumming for a Buddy Rich tribute that meant re-learning the motion of the hands and feet of drumming. Taps drums two ways. Neil turned grip around. Test For Echo. ""Ghost Rider."" When Neil suffered a double tragedy, they were so worried about him, he disappeared on a road trip, friends and family formed a network to update each other as to when they'd hear from him. Alex lost interest in music as well even, for one year not picking up his instrument at all. Landscapes, highways and wildlife revived Peart. The band have 6,000 nicknames for each other, he sent lifelines signed as one or the other of these nicknames. Had to stop moving before he could think about doing it again. Slow process to get his chops back. Pure and truthful energy on Vapour Trails. Amazed at the Sao Paolo show, when 60,000 fans showed up. The band appeared on the Colbert Report, interviewed and supported by a new generation of entertainers as the real thing. ""The people have generally, consistently voted for them."" Billy Corgan very intelligent comments. Geddy reading ""The Sound And The Fury"" on a flight (brave man - I couldn't get into it at all). ""We had our own stream, and it wasn't the main one, but it wasn't too far away,"" says Geddy Lee. Nonetheless, they actually have a devoted following, people turn their kids on to Rush. ""There's a comfort to know that those same three guys are out there. It's also special to see three guys who can tolerate each other after all these years and make good music,"" says Les Claypool. ""They're on a righteous path,"" Trent Reznor.The extras are also very good: Long scenes of reminiscing around the Fisherville Junior High School, running greaser gauntlet at the bus stop, built snow man on the front lawn, rode a bike because it was the only mode of transport. Riding around Toronto. First time back to The Coffin since their gig there. Gas station Geddy used to work at. Pantzer's now Anton's. Les Claypool first concert was Rush, Hemispheres tour, Pat Travers Band opened up, he was 14 years old. All of Hemispheres was recorded a semi-tone too high for Geddy's voice. Alex plays golf on days off. ""Birds chirping, horses neighing, bones cracking. Golf is about tempo and rhythm and not trying too hard, not getting in the way of your swing, much like playing an instrument, just let your instinct take over and play."" Geddy collects art, baseballs - players and presidents. Neil - model car building, cycling, reading. Motorcycles. Practicing throwing stick up in the air. Rush Con 7 - Rush trekkies. Rush karaoke and Guitar Hero. Guy with Queens of the Stone Age t-shirt. ""Kim Mitchell, Helix and Rush, nice camera, eh,"" that must be the directors improvising. Alex doing ole honkin' blues in a backstage warm-up. ""Working Man"" with John Rutsey at a high school show doing the intros from behind the drum kit, great, except for Alex's music notes shirt. Groovy ""La Villa Strangiata"" cuts, off funky intro. Dedicated ""Between The Sun And Moon"" to John Entwistle, first time they ever played it, in 2002. Twelve minutes of dinner conversation with Rush. Geddy calls Alex ""Lerx"" in conversation. ""I've got my notepad here."" Neil's drunken laugh. Alex playing a Telecaster, looking very David Gilmour. Commentary on Neil Peart's outrageous mustaches.I am happy that this movie exists, for people like me to remember what a great band this is, and to set the record straight. This is also an important movie for the masses, Rush fans and non-fans alike - people who are not Rush fans and are perplexed why their friends like Rush so much, for example, watch the movie and they finally get it.At the same time, however, I'm confused why this film was made. Here you've got guys who have everything - they have fame, they have fortune, they have friendship, they have a massive fan base, they have achieved anything a musician can achieve (except, maybe, admission into the Rock `n' Roll Hall Of Fame, whatever that means); they are private people; why do they need this? Did they agree to do this for the fans?  The fans know everything that there is to know about Rush anyway, much more than is in this movie. Were they somehow talked into going along with this? Is Rush Corporation at a stage in their development where they need to take it to the next level, finally, or it's never ever going to happen? Everyone's getting older, of course. Were they astounded by the success of the Anvil movie and wondered why they never thought of it earlier?  Some of the aspects of this film do have the appearances of contract publishing - the band has so much brutal honesty, and they seem like guys with very little to hide, that you can't suspect that the documentarians went easy on them, but it's still a perplexing piece of work in some ways. It's amazing, really.Finally, I'm further convinced at how important the song ""Limelight"" is to the band and its fans. It provides the lyrical reference to the DVD's title, the band is often quoting it (Neil notes the relevance of ""I can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend"" at one point in the video). I am confirmed, also, in my belief that it is justified beyond just personally liking it for it to be my favorite Rush song.The packaging is pretty good, with beautiful pics all across the outer case, a huge concert pic from the inside package, pics of the guys in their younger days, and a gorgeous full-colour 12-page booklet.",5,Who dares give this anything less than five stars?,1318982400,"10 19,

So, my Rush credentials are in order.By any modern standard, this can hardly be called a documentary. It's clear that the members don't like any in-depth prodding, so what we end up with is really shallow. Here's what the DVD covers:1. Early years.2. Critics never liked us.3. Here's what each album was about.4. A teeny bit of personal stuff.And, that's it. Instead of prodding Neil Peart and the others about their Ayn Rand fixation, we hear nothing of it. Ayn Rand was a bizarre person, with even more bizarre beliefs, and hated people she thought were a drain on other successful people. So why the intense appeal of this loony to three great musicians that seem like nice guys?Instead of asking Alex Lifeson about his brawl with police officers in 2003, we get to see the church basement they played at when they were sixteen.We don't even get to hear how ""Gary"" became ""Geddy"".The whole thing is really, really shallow. They don't even discuss the music in depth. Just that they tried to push themselves.Oh, and please stop putting Jack Black in all these documentaries on rock bands. The only thing worse than his bad acting is his bad documentary input. Please put a muzzle on that clown.
