306661,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302308208,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[44, 46]","This is a riveting soap opera with a cast that holds all the pieces together, and keeps the sometimes improbable plot fascinating at all times for the viewer.It was filmed on a soundstage, with very effective scenic design by William Cameron Menzies...I just love the skies !Brilliantly conceived and directed by Sam Wood, it's based on Harry Bellamann's best-selling novel. The excellent Erich Wolfgang Korngold score also adds to the drama and atmosphere.Set in a turn of the century small town, where the dark secrets and vile motives of some contrast with the goodness of others, the best scenes are between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan.The chemistry between them is a delight, and their acting so real, one feels one is sharing the moment with them, even though this was filmed over 60 years ago. They shine as Randy and Drake, two strong, independent, and fun loving souls.With the exception of one or two scenes with rather stilted dialogue between Betty Field and Robert Cummings, the pacing never lags. There are great actors even in the supporting roles, like Dame Judith Anderson and Maria Ouspenskaya. Claude Rains is absolutely marvelous, and steals every scene he's in.This classic was nominated for several Oscars...B&amp;W Cinematography (James Wong Howe), Director, and Best Picture, but lost to a &quot;Mrs. Minever&quot; sweep.It's perhaps Ronald Reagan's best performance, so this film is a piece of American history, as well as being highly entertaining.",5,"good melodrama, great cast",1035158400,"10 21, 2002",2002,1477,"['riveting', 'soap', 'opera', 'cast', 'pieces', 'together', 'sometimes', 'improbable', 'plot', 'fascinating', 'times', 'viewer.It', 'was', 'filmed', 'soundstage', 'very', 'effective', 'scenic', 'design', 'William', 'Cameron', 'Menzies', 'just', 'love', 'skies', 'Brilliantly', 'conceived', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'based', 'Harry', 'Bellamann', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'excellent', 'Erich', 'Wolfgang', 'Korngold', 'score', 'also', 'drama', 'atmosphere.Set', 'turn', 'century', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'dark', 'secrets', 'vile', 'motives', 'contrast', 'goodness', 'others', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'Ronald', 'Reagan.The', 'chemistry', 'delight', 'acting', 'so', 'real', 'one', 'feels', 'one', 'sharing', 'moment', 'even', 'was', 'filmed', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'shine', 'Randy', 'Drake', 'two', 'strong', 'independent', 'fun', 'loving', 'souls.With', 'exception', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'rather', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'Betty', 'Field', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'pacing', 'never', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'even', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Dame', 'Judith', 'Anderson', 'Maria', 'Ouspenskaya', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'steals', 'scene', 'in.This', 'classic', 'was', 'nominated', 'several', 'Oscars', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'Cinematography', 'James', 'Wong', 'Howe', 'Director', 'Best', 'Picture', 'lost', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Minever', 'quot', 'sweep.It', 'perhaps', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'piece', 'American', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'highly', 'entertaining']",N/A

The first being, it's one of my grandmother's favorite movies, the other, the death of the former President.&quot;Kings Row&quot; is quite an accomplised film from director Sam Wood, a man who has directed serval American classics that would take up too much space if I recited them all here, but they include &quot;Goodbye Mr. Chips&quot;, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;, and two Marx Brothers comedies &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;.&quot;Kings Row&quot; directly and indirectly takes on what must have been a lot of taboo subjects. One of the main ones being fornication.The movie starts off with a shot of a sign that reads; &quot;Kings Row, a great pace to raise your children&quot;. From that we are suppose to suspect this is a friendly small town, that to some would seem being. Everybody knows each other and spreads the town's gossip and the people give excited waiting for the local events, but as the film goes on we find out there is much going on behind everyone's back.And the town is not as innocent as it seems.The film's main characters are Parris Mitchell (Robert Cummings) and Drake McHugh (Reagan) who have remained friends since childhood. Now that both are older they are soon starting to discover the secrets that lie beneath the town and some of its citizens.The movie has a terrific cast including Claude Rains as Dr. Tower, a man who is trying to help Parris become a doctor, he also happens to be the father of Cassie (Betty Field), the love of Parris' life. Then there Dr. Henry Gordon (Charles Coburn) who is known to give usual operations and is the father of Louis (Nany Coleman), the girl Drake plans to marry. And there's Ann Sheridan  as Randy Monaghan.Just about everyone in the film does a good job acting wise, but I think it's Cummings' movie all the way, not Reagan. But either way you look at it you have to admit &quot;Kings Row&quot; is an interesting film that holds your interest.Bottom-line: Well made dramatic suspense film notably known as one of Ronald Reagan's best films, but Robert Cummings gives one of his best performances.

306663,AB4F6UHL20U95,6302308208,Anne Rice,"[2, 4]","Just re-watched this movie after reading the novel by Henry Bellamann.  The movie to me is immensely enjoyable and satisfying due to its scope, its presentation of a small  American town enduring through times of dramatic change,  and its focus on the hero, young Parris Mitchell, a sensitive and honorable boy who  strives to become a world class doctor and psychiatrist and bring the fruits of his learning home to the community in which he was born.  The cinematography was beautiful, and the direction excellent.  The entire cast is superb.  Robert Cummings is very appealing as Parris; Ronald Reagan is excellent as his best friend; and Claude Rains is positively outstanding as a mysterious doctor with many secrets.  Just about everybody deserves a mention.  -------  However this film, for all its virtues, does not really convey the darkness and complexity and ambitions of Bellamann's novel, and I recommend that anyone captivated by the movie might want to try to the book.  The book is literature.  The book deserves to be re-discovered and re-printed.  -------  How the film crafts an essentially positive story out of Parris's journey and the sufferings of those around him is a rather interesting subject.  Those with a special interest in the topic of books made into movies might find the question of the decisions here fascinating.  --- The movie ultimately is a fine piece of work with resolutions rooted in its material.  But do let it point the way to the book.

Incest, homosexuallity, crime, murder.... in a beautiful village.Which version now is better? Novel or movie?Well, because there was the ""Hayes Code"", each controversal aspects was eliminated for (or hidden in) the movie.Warner Brothers did what it was allowed at this time but there are still some shocking moments: like the scene with the later US-President Ronald Reagan who woke up and say: ""Where is the rest of me?"" (which was his best moment in his movie career).I have never seen this movie before until now - after I heard the soundtrack of Erich Wolfgang Korngold on CD. I was curious about and yes, I liked the movie.The child actors on the beginning are great: specially Douglas Croft (who was the first ""Robin"" in a Batman Serial in 1943) and Scotty Beckett who sadly died very young in 1968 at age of 38 (he went into a life of alcoholism, drugs, and crime remains one of the most tragic of Hollywood stories).Its the movie boring? Defintive not but maybe you should check wikipedia and imdb before so you'll understanding the movie a little bit better.The DVD:- the picture qualitity is pretty good and also the soundtrack is good.- Subtitles in english are available- the DVD Contains some bonus features.

The gentlemanly Cummings playing Parris Mitchell is lovingly raised by his grandmother and aspires to be a doctor.  Reagan playing rabble rouser Drake McHugh is a fun loving fellow with a large anticipated inheritance.  Cummings is enamored with Cassie Tower, played by Betty Field, daughter of a brilliant physician played by a terse and professional Claude Rains.  Rains has chosen to live a very secluded life with a limited practice due to his wife's mental illness, which is being dealt with secretively.  Cummings is mortified when his beloved Cassie is suddenly pulled out of school and in effect imprisoned in her home.Reagan, meanwhile, fancies Louise Gordon daughter of prominent Kings Row doctor the blackhearted and judgemental Dr. Henry Gordon played by Charles Coburn.  Coburn does not approve of the relationship between Reagan and Nancy Coleman who plays his daughter.  As a result, Reagan begins carousing with a group of loosely moraled girls.  He eventually falls for a virtuous girl and ex-tomboy from the wrong side of the tracks Randy Monaghan played by the beautiful Ann Sheridan.  Sheridan, while of meager economic background is morally well grounded, caring and intelligent.Cummings has been mentored under the wing of Rains, who is preparing him for admission ot medical school in Vienna.  Just prior to his embarking to Europe, a terrible tragedy occurs to Rains and his daughter Cassie revealing some terrible secrets.While in Europe, Cummings is unaware that Reagan has suffered an unfortunate financial disaster.  Luckily, with Sheridan at his side, he manages to overcome his misfortune.  Things are going well when a heart breaking catastrophic accident occurs leaving Reagan both physically and mentally challenged.  Again Sheridan bolsters him and they marry.  All the while Sheridan prays for dear friend Cummings' return from abroad.Cummings who is now an accomplished psychiatrist, a new medical specialty, eventually returns to Kings Row.  He can't bear to stay as the town holds too many painful memories for him.  He manages to nurture Reagan and restores him to a healthier mental state.  He learns of the terrible circumstances surrounding Reagan's condition which he fears to reveal.Cummings casually meets Elsie Sandor played by German born Kaaren Verne, who is now living with her dad in his grandmother's old house.  The begin a relationship that convinces him to start life anew in Kings Row.Director Sam Wood does a marvelous job in creating a mesmerizing soap opera plot which truly engrosses you in the lives of the inhabitants of Kings Row.

It's basic premise is that the sins of the elders results in wrath upon their innocent offspring.  What I admire about the Production code days is that they don't have to spell out explicitly the venality of the characters but they depend on the intuitive intelligence of the audience to know what's going on.  Director Sam Wood paints a pessimistic picture of smalltown America but ultimately offers a message of hopefullness that doesn't feel hokey or contrived.  The film is impeccably cast without a bad performance in the bunch.  Most interest is in Ronald Reagan as the devil-may-care Drake and working with a top-notch cast seems to inspire Reagan to give one his best performances.

306671,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302308208,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""Kings Row"" is a 1942 melodrama that is permeated by the psychoanalytic culture that had taken over Hollywood and can be seen in so many 1940s films (e.g., ""Spellbound"", ""The Snake Pit"", ""Home of the Brave"", ""Possessed"", ""Conflict"")The film stars Robert Cummings, Ronald Reagan, and Betty Field with Claude Rains, Charles Coburn, and Ann Sheridan. A great supporting cast includes Dame Judith Anderson and Maria Ouspenskaya.We think of Robert Cummings as a comedian, in such films as ""The Devil and Miss Jones"" (1941), ""The Bride Wore Boots"" (1946), and ""My Geisha"" (1962) and, of course, TVs ""The Bob Cummings Show"" (1955-9). But Cummings was equally capable of dramatic roles as he demonstrated in films like ""Saboteur"" (1942) and ""Dial M For Murder"" (1954) and he even won an Emmy for his performance in ""Twelve Angry Men"" (1955). Cummings gives an excellent performance here as the young medical student torn between music and medicine and his childhood love.Betty Field, as the neurotic incest victim, steals this film as she did with ""Shepherd of the Hills"" (1941). Field is best remembered for her body of work on Broadway, but she made more than a dozen films including Mae in ""Of Mice and Men"" (1939), and Nellie in ""Peyton Place"" (1957).Charles Coburn plays a sadistic, religiously fanatic physician. He appeared in more than 50 films, from 1933 through 1962. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times and won once (""The More the Merrier"" in 1943). I remember him best as ""Piggy"" in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blonds"" (1953). His role as a villain is one of the rare times that Coburn played the heavy. His does it well, especially in one of his final scenes with his daughter, played by Nancy Coleman.Ann Sheridan was one of the biggest box office stars of the late 30s and 40s and a top pinup girl in WW 2 when she was called ""The Oomph Girl"". She appeared in such box office hits as ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938), ""They Made me a Criminal"" (1939), ""Dodge City"" (1939) and  ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"" (1942). Known for her sex appeal, there is a solid actress underneath and she shows it here, although she doesn't appear until midway through the film.Harry Davenport has a brief role as a town elder. Between 1914 and 1950 he appeared in more than 150 films, none more memorable that his role as the gracious Colonel Meade in ""GWTW"" (1939). He was equally proficient as King Louis in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939) and the old man in ""The Ox Bow Incident"" (1943). He was the brother-in-law of Lionel Barrymore and in several scenes he appears to be channeling Lionel.Judith Anderson was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Rebecca"" (1940) and 8 times for an Emmy, winning twice (""MacBeth"" in 1961 and ""MacBeth"" in 1951). In 1960 she was awarded the title ""Dame"" by Britain's Queen, and is usually called Dame Judith Anderson. Anderson made only a dozen films as she specialized in theatre. Anderson is completely wasted in this film, with few appearances and few lines.Maria Ouspenskaya was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Dodsworth"" in 1936 and ""Love Affair"" in 1939) but I remember her best as the Gypsy woman in ""The Wolfman"" (1941) and ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" (1943). She plays Cummings' grandmother and puts in her usual touching performance. There is some particularly good camera work surrounding her death. FWIW - in the original novel, her grandson performs a mercy killing.Sam Wood directs. Wood began his career as an assistant to Cecil B DeMille and started directing films in 1920. He hit his stride in the mid 30s with ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935), ""A Day at the Races"" (1937), and ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" (1939) for which he received his first of 3 Oscar nominations. He got his second nomination for this film. Among the 80 films he directed ""Pride of the Yankees"" (1942) and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (1943) stand out.The cinematography is by James Wong Howe, one of Hollywood's best cameramen. Howe's characteristic use of deep focus and dramatic lighting are well in evidence. He also uses many unusual angles which is not as characteristic of his style, but which he uses effectively. Howe was nominated for an Oscar 10 times, including for this film, and won twice (""Hud"" and ""The Rose Tatoo""), making him one of the most acknowledged cinematographers in film history.The music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is haunting. It's so powerful it's almost a central character. Korngold was nominated 2 times for an Oscar (""Sea Hawk"" and ""Elizabeth and Essex""), and won once (""Robin Hood""). He composed nearly 20 films, many of them with Errol FlynnIt's impossible to view ""Kings Row"" without reflecting on Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"". Both dealt with the wealthy class in small towns around the turn of the 20th century and both chronicle the passing of an era. Ambersons is clearly the superior picture, although Kings Row has its moments. Interestingly enough both films have a pretty pessimistic view of the future, even if Kings Row ends with an upbeat scene.As a film, it's hard to endure 2+ hours of incest, insanity, mutilation, larceny, cancer, and more insanity without getting depressed. Film critic Bosley Crowther called it ""gloomy"". It's a testament to the performance of the main characters that we're able to watch without running for the doors (changing the channel). The film did receive 3 Oscar nominations (Cinematography, Director, Picture).It's certainly worth watching as a film even if the subject matter is a bit daunting.",4,"Excellent film, depressing

306672,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,6302308208,elena maria vidal,"[5, 5]","Anyone who has ever dismissed Ronald Reagan as a ""B-movie"" actor has only to see him in ""King's Row"" to realize that he was perfectly capable of being an ""A-movie"" actor. In Reagan's case, I do not think that it was a question of mediocre talent but rather of having the right material and the kind of director who could command a superb performance. Sam Wood was one such director, and the 1942 film, based upon Henry Bellaman's novel of the same name, afforded the dramatic setting in which Reagan could shine.Set in a small Missouri town in the early 1900's, ""King's Row"" explores many issues which have come to haunt modern times, specifically the power and authority of the medical profession over people's lives. It emphasizes that being a physician is a vocation in which the highest integrity is absolutely indispensable. Without a moral compass, the medical profession is doomed to barbarity.In spite of the idyllic appearance of the town, it is haunted by a sadistic doctor who sees himself ordained to punish sinners, as long as the sinners in question are too poor and obscure to defend themselves. Ronald Reagan portrays ""Drake,"" the charming, lackadaisical rascal of the town, whom the sadist Dr. Gordon (Charles Coburn) chooses to castigate in a particularly grotesque manner. Reagan's interpretation of Drake's response to the horror which befalls him is one of the most powerful moments in classic cinema.Drake is the boyhood friend of the protagonist ""Parris,"" played by Robert Cummings, and the brotherly bond between them is a beautiful portrayal of true friendship. Meanwhile, the neurotic women in their lives bring with them situations fraught with dark secrets, except for Parris' grandmother (Maria Ouspenskaya) and Drake's girlfriend (Ann Sheridan) who bring hope and balance. The Ann Sheridan character ""Randy Monaghan"" is supposed to be Catholic, and the scene in which she murmurs ""O Blessed Mother of God!"" is profoundly moving.Ultimately, Parris, who becomes a doctor himself, is faced with a moral dilemma in which he must choose to use his medical credentials to save or to destroy. His new friend, a lovely Viennese girl, leads him to the light, and the darkness which threatens to overwhelm the characters is overcome.",5,Physicians and Integrity,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,2253,"['Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'dismissed', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'B-movie', 'actor', 'only', 'see', 'King', 'Row', 'realize', 'was', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'being', 'A-movie', 'actor', 'Reagan', 'case', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'question', 'mediocre', 'talent', 'rather', 'having', 'right', 'material', 'kind', 'director', 'who', 'could', 'command', 'superb', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'was', 'one', 'such', 'director', '1942', 'film', 'based', 'Henry', 'Bellaman', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'afforded', 'dramatic', 'setting', 'Reagan', 'could', 'shine.Set', 'small', 'Missouri', 'town', 'early', '1900', 'King', 'Row', 'many', 'issues', 'have', 'come', 'haunt', 'modern', 'times', 'specifically', 'power', 'authority', 'medical', 'profession', 'people', 'lives', 'being', 'physician', 'vocation', 'highest', 'integrity', 'absolutely', 'indispensable', 'moral', 'compass', 'medical', 'profession', 'doomed', 'barbarity.In', 'spite', 'idyllic', 'appearance', 'town', 'haunted', 'sadistic', 'doctor', 'who', 'ordained', 'punish', 'sinners', 'as', 'long', 'sinners', 'question', 'are', 'too', 'poor', 'obscure', 'defend', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Drake', 'charming', 'lackadaisical', 'rascal', 'town', 'whom', 'sadist', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'castigate', 'particularly', 'grotesque', 'manner', 'Reagan', 'interpretation', 'Drake', 'response', 'horror', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'classic', 'cinema.Drake', 'boyhood', 'friend', 'protagonist', 'Parris', 'played', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'brotherly', 'bond', 'beautiful', 'portrayal', 'true', 'friendship', 'Meanwhile', 'neurotic', 'women', 'lives', 'bring', 'situations', 'fraught', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Parris', 'grandmother', 'Maria', 'Ouspenskaya', 'Drake', 'girlfriend', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'bring', 'hope', 'balance', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'character', 'Randy', 'Monaghan', 'supposed', 'be', 'Catholic', 'scene', 'O', 'Blessed', 'Mother', 'God', 'profoundly', 'moving.Ultimately', 'Parris', 'who', 'doctor', 'faced', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'must', 'choose', 'use', 'medical', 'credentials', 'save', 'destroy', 'new', 'friend', 'lovely', 'Viennese', 'girl', 'light', 'darkness', 'overwhelm', 'characters', 'overcome']",N/A

Behind the peaceful facade of a small town, two men (Ronald Reagan in his lifetime `s performance and Robert Cummings, who would be the star in Hitchcock's Sabotage) will grow up and experience in own flesh the moral decay and relentless corruption.The main obstacle which had to surmount this extraordinary movie, was to have dealt with the sordid and demolishing film ""Grapes of Wrath"". These were wartimes and films like this one or ""The Citizen Kane"" (a film that is still regarded as the supreme masterpiece of the American cinema, ignored, overlooked and displaced by ""How green was my valley"") wouldn't contribute as moral infusion in order to feed the kindled patriotism to face with the outland enemy. Needless to say the great public needed evasion and that's why you should not surprise why films such as ""Snow white and the seven dwarfs""(1938), ""Wizard of Oz"" (1939) or ""Fantasia""(1940) literally were the most celebrated films during those years.So the film had to wait for almost a decade to be truly recognized as a forerunner movie.

306682,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302308208,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[25, 26]","&quot;King's Row&quot; is the most distinguished film of Ronald Reagan's actor career, for which he drew his best reviews.  However, by the time it was released in 1942, Reagan was in the Army and his film career received a fateful interruption that would eventually lead to his shifting to a political career.  I remember that when Breshnev was preparing to meet with President Reagan the Soviet leader screened several of Reagan's films, and &quot;King's Row&quot; was the one that impressed him.  If you have already seen this film, directed by Sam Wood, you know why.The film focuses on five childhood friends who grow up to complicated lives.  Parris Mitchell (Robert Cummings) has become a medical student, studying privately with Dr. Alexander Tower (Claude Rains), whose daughter Cassandra (Betty Field) is a sheltered neurotic.  Louise Gordon (Nancy Coleman) has been raised by harsh parents who warn here away from playboy Drake McHugh (Reagan), who is living off an inheritance.  Drake ends up falling for Randy Monoghan (Ann Sheridan), the former tomboy who has grown up in to a most practical working class girl.  Things then get very dark.  First, when Dr. Tower discovers Cassandra is pregnant he kills her and himself.  Then, after losing his fortune and taking a job at the railroad yard, Drake is injured and Dr. Gordon (Charles Coburn) decides to amputate the young man's legs as a punishment for his former hedonism.  This is what leads to Reagan's unforgettable scene when he wakes up and discovers what has been done to him.  The scene could have become ludicrous, but Reagan pulls it off and it is clearly his finest moment as an actor.&quot;King's Row&quot; is based on the novel by Henry Bellamann, which is a massive story of sadism and thwarted love in what was clearly the &quot;Payton Place&quot; of its day, set in a quiet Midwestern town at the turn of the (last) century.  A lot of the novel's elements, such as incest, homosexuality and euthanasia were never going to make it into the film forcing screenwriter Casey Robinson to salvage what he could (e.g., turning the incest between Dr. Tower and his daughter Cassandra into a question of insanity).  Robinson also gave the movie a &quot;happier&quot; ending (originally, Drake McHugh dies of cancer after his legs are unnecessarily amputated).  Even more radical was the casting, since few in Hollywood were comfortable with Sheridan, Cummings and Reagan having the three lead roles.  However, all of them perform admirably, as does Field and the supporting cast of veteran character actors.  Reagan would go on to entitle his autobiography &quot;Where's the Rest of Me?&quot; after the famous line he screams when he awakens to discover his legs are gone.",5,A grim soap opera with Ronald Reagan's finest performance,1000598400,"09 16, 2001",2001,2742,"['quot', 'King', 'Row', 'quot', 'most', 'distinguished', 'film', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'actor', 'career', 'drew', 'best', 'reviews', 'However', 'time', 'was', 'released', '1942', 'Reagan', 'was', 'Army', 'film', 'career', 'received', 'fateful', 'interruption', 'would', 'eventually', 'lead', 'shifting', 'political', 'career', 'remember', 'when', 'Breshnev', 'was', 'preparing', 'meet', 'President', 'Reagan', 'Soviet', 'leader', 'screened', 'several', 'Reagan', 'films', 'quot', 'King', 'Row', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'impressed', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'know', 'why.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'five', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'complicated', 'lives', 'Parris', 'Mitchell', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'become', 'medical', 'student', 'studying', 'privately', 'Dr.', 'Alexander', 'Tower', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'daughter', 'Cassandra', 'Betty', 'Field', 'sheltered', 'neurotic', 'Louise', 'Gordon', 'Nancy', 'Coleman', 'been', 'raised', 'harsh', 'parents', 'who', 'warn', 'here', 'away', 'playboy', 'Drake', 'McHugh', 'Reagan', 'who', 'living', 'off', 'inheritance', 'Drake', 'up', 'falling', 'Randy', 'Monoghan', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'former', 'tomboy', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'most', 'practical', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'Things', 'then', 'get', 'very', 'dark', 'First', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Tower', 'discovers', 'Cassandra', 'pregnant', 'Then', 'losing', 'fortune', 'taking', 'job', 'railroad', 'yard', 'Drake', 'injured', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'amputate', 'young', 'man', 'legs', 'punishment', 'former', 'hedonism', 'what', 'Reagan', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'when', 'up', 'discovers', 'been', 'done', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'ludicrous', 'Reagan', 'off', 'clearly', 'finest', 'moment', 'actor.', 'quot', 'King', 'Row', 'quot', 'based', 'novel', 'Henry', 'Bellamann', 'massive', 'story', 'sadism', 'thwarted', 'love', 'what', 'was', 'clearly', 'quot', 'Payton', 'Place', 'quot', 'day', 'set', 'quiet', 'Midwestern', 'town', 'turn', 'last', 'century', 'lot', 'novel', 'elements', 'such', 'incest', 'homosexuality', 'euthanasia', 'were', 'never', 'going', 'make', 'film', 'forcing', 'screenwriter', 'Casey', 'Robinson', 'salvage', 'what', 'could', 'e.g.', 'turning', 'incest', 'Dr.', 'Tower', 'daughter', 'Cassandra', 'question', 'insanity', 'Robinson', 'also', 'gave', 'movie', 'quot', 'happier', 'quot', 'ending', 'originally', 'Drake', 'McHugh', 'dies', 'cancer', 'legs', 'are', 'unnecessarily', 'amputated', 'Even', 'more', 'radical', 'was', 'casting', 'few', 'Hollywood', 'were', 'comfortable', 'Sheridan', 'Cummings', 'Reagan', 'having', 'three', 'lead', 'roles', 'However', 'perform', 'admirably', 'Field', 'supporting', 'cast', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'Reagan', 'would', 'go', 'entitle', 'autobiography', 'quot', 'Where', 'Rest', 'Me', 'quot', 'famous', 'line', 'screams', 'when', 'discover', 'legs', 'are', 'gone']",N/A

Based upon the excellent novel of the same name by Henry Bellaman, the film takes place, for the most part, in a charming small hamlet in America at the turn of the twentieth Century. All appears to be bucolic on the surface, but beneath that carefully cultivated veneer lies a cancer that it is slowly eating away at it.Parris Mitchell is raised by his adoring, doting grandmother in a comfortable, well to do part of town. His school boy crush in is his early years is Cassandra Tower, the daughter of a Alexander Tower (Claude Rains), a doctor who does not have an active practice, and a reclusive mother who never leaves the house.  Cassandra and Parris are inseparable school companions, walking home from school, swimming in the lake, and just being young together.Their idyllic time together comes to an abrupt end, however, when her father suddenly decides she will be home schooled and is kept home. So, he becomes best friends with a young scamp, Drake McHugh, who takes him under his wing and together they have all sorts of small town fun, even going over to the wrong side of the tracks and meeting up with tomboy Randy Monahan. Still, he never forgets Cassandra. Once they grow up, however, the vicissitudes of life overtake them all.Ronald Regan is featured in one of his best roles, cast as the adult Drake McHugh, a rascally, yet charming, young rake about town who simply oozes charm and likeability, as he lives off his inheritance. He simply gives a bravura performance. Robert Cummings is likewise outstanding, cast in the role of the adult Parris Mitchell, a sensitive young man who studies to be a psychiatrist, little knowing how invaluable his training would be. Ann Sheridan is also terrific in the role of the adult Randy Monaghan, a young stalwart woman from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with the adult Drake McHugh and stays with him through thick and thin. Betty Field gives a moving performance as the adult Constance Tower, a neurotic, and clearly troubled young woman. Claude Rains is well cast and gives an excellent performance as Doctor Alexander Tower, a man with a terrible secret that eats away at him until he can take it no more and then does the unthinkable.There are many other fine performances by others in this first rate film that explores the dark side of life.

Taken from the novel by Harry Bellamann, KINGS ROW, under the sure hand of director Sam Wood, manages to convey a gripping peek into the lives of Middle America at the turn of the century. There are many critics who compare this to a pre-World War II PEYTON PLACE, and there is some justification for that in that both deal with the lives of small town residents who try to be normal and decent when some of them are so repellent as to stagger the imagination. In KINGS ROW, the town of that name is so central to the plot and theme that it very nearly comes close to functioning as a character in its own right almost as if it were a collective chorus from a Greek play.Ronald Reagan gives arguably his finest performance as Drake, a man who had been sheltered all his life by his family's wealth and status, but early on, he has to deal with the loss of all that as he tries to find a niche in a town where he is hated in secret by a man who is simply biding his time waiting for the moment to do him harm.  Today, we tend to laugh at Reagan the actor as we well remember the blandness of his many roles typified in BEDTIME FOR BONZO, a title which feeds into a general distate for those who came to hate him for his politics and conservatism.  Yet, here Reagan shows that with the right script and cast, he can and does shine as one who must face the horror of knowing that his fall from grace need never have happened at all.  His scenes with Ann Sheridan, the girl from the ""other side of the tracks"" are memorable in that they reinforce the subtext that middle class westerners were the backbone of a society that was fiercely tested by a crunching Depression and would be soon tested by events in Europe that even then were looming on the cinematic horizon. Robert Cummings as his lifelong friend Parris also has what may have been his best moment as an actor.  Here Cummings plays Damon to Reagan's Pythias as both lean on each other for support even though they are widely separated in time and space.  There is a cast of supporting actors all of whom bounce off each other in all the right ways.  Betty Field as the lunatic suitor of Reagan tears at our heart strings.  Charles Coburn as the town doctor harbors a secret so vile that we shudder when we finally learn of it.  Claude Rains has yet another opportunity to play the educated gentleman, who like Rochester in JANE EYRE, has his own secret hidden in an attic.By the end of the film, the viewer can readily understand why KINGS ROW just got nudged out as Best Picture.  For the space of two hours, that viewer can participate in an America that is just as real as today as when Harry Bellamann first wrote of it 100 years ago.",5,When A Potboiler Becomes a Great Movie,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,2834,"['KINGS', 'ROW', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'potboiler', 'status', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'legitimate', 'claim', 'near-great', 'movie', 'Taken', 'novel', 'Harry', 'Bellamann', 'KINGS', 'ROW', 'sure', 'hand', 'director', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'convey', 'gripping', 'peek', 'lives', 'Middle', 'America', 'turn', 'century', 'are', 'many', 'critics', 'who', 'compare', 'pre-World', 'War', 'II', 'PEYTON', 'PLACE', 'justification', 'deal', 'lives', 'small', 'town', 'residents', 'who', 'try', 'be', 'normal', 'decent', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'repellent', 'stagger', 'imagination', 'KINGS', 'ROW', 'town', 'name', 'so', 'central', 'plot', 'theme', 'very', 'nearly', 'close', 'functioning', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'almost', 'were', 'collective', 'chorus', 'Greek', 'play.Ronald', 'Reagan', 'arguably', 'finest', 'performance', 'Drake', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'sheltered', 'life', 'family', 'wealth', 'status', 'early', 'deal', 'loss', 'find', 'niche', 'town', 'where', 'hated', 'secret', 'man', 'who', 'simply', 'biding', 'time', 'waiting', 'moment', 'do', 'harm', 'Today', 'tend', 'laugh', 'Reagan', 'actor', 'well', 'remember', 'blandness', 'many', 'roles', 'typified', 'BEDTIME', 'FOR', 'BONZO', 'title', 'general', 'distate', 'who', 'came', 'hate', 'politics', 'conservatism', 'here', 'Reagan', 'right', 'script', 'cast', 'can', 'shine', 'one', 'who', 'must', 'face', 'horror', 'knowing', 'fall', 'grace', 'need', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'scenes', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'girl', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'are', 'memorable', 'reinforce', 'subtext', 'middle', 'class', 'westerners', 'were', 'backbone', 'society', 'was', 'fiercely', 'tested', 'crunching', 'Depression', 'would', 'be', 'soon', 'tested', 'events', 'Europe', 'even', 'then', 'were', 'looming', 'cinematic', 'horizon', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Parris', 'also', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'moment', 'actor', 'Here', 'Cummings', 'Damon', 'Reagan', 'Pythias', 'lean', 'other', 'support', 'even', 'are', 'widely', 'separated', 'time', 'space', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'whom', 'bounce', 'other', 'right', 'ways', 'Betty', 'Field', 'lunatic', 'suitor', 'Reagan', 'tears', 'heart', 'strings', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'town', 'doctor', 'secret', 'so', 'vile', 'shudder', 'when', 'finally', 'learn', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'yet', 'opportunity', 'play', 'educated', 'gentleman', 'who', 'Rochester', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'own', 'secret', 'hidden', 'attic.By', 'end', 'film', 'viewer', 'can', 'readily', 'understand', 'why', 'KINGS', 'ROW', 'just', 'got', 'nudged', 'out', 'Best', 'Picture', 'space', 'two', 'hours', 'viewer', 'can', 'participate', 'America', 'just', 'as', 'real', 'as', 'today', 'when', 'Harry', 'Bellamann', 'first', 'wrote', '100', 'years', 'ago']",N/A

Given the chance to prove that she was more than just a second lead or wise-cracking girlfriend, Sheridan shows that she can handle drama, especially in the scenes with Reagan (who also is above his usual workman-like performances) after he has his accident and loses his legs.Maria Ouspenskaya, best know as the gypsy in &quot;The Wolf Man,&quot; shows that she was a very underrated character actress in her brilliant performance as Parris' grandmother, a queenly and noble woman who instills all of the right values in her grandson.Korngold's score is superb (a precursor of John Williams' score for &quot;Star Wars&quot;), and if you can find a copy of it on CD, I suggest a listen to that as well.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[7, 8]","Matriarch Maria Ouspenskaya (Beyond Tomorrow) prepares her son, Parris (Robert Cummings) for a medical career, sending him to study with Kings Row's good doctor Tower, portrayed by Claude Rains (Here Comes Mr. Jordan, The Invisible Man).  But Tower, an eccentric intellectual who keeps his family hidden from the town, is not the doctor people go to see.  Instead, most people call on Doctor Gordon,  apparently typical small town doctor with a hidden sadistic side, a character brought to life believably by the usually lovable Charles Coburn (Louisa, The Devil and Miss Jones).Parris has had a crush since childhood on Dr. Tower's daughter Cassandra, whom we're gradually led to suspect of dementia by Betty Field's subtle portrayal.  He rarely gets to see her in adulthood, due to her father's ultra-protectiveness.  His best friend Drake McHugh (Ronald Reagan, later President of the United States) is in love with the other Doctor's daughter, Louise Gordon (Nancy Coleman), but Dr. Gordon won't tolerate his presence.These romances seem to contribute to the towns most scandalous tragedies, first a murder-suicide and later a medical atrocity.  After the first, Parris pursues his education in Europe, becoming a pioneering psychiatrist, then returning too late to prevent the second tragedy, involving his best friend Drake, but determined to solve it.  After all this, without giving away the plot, the end is onward looking and uplifting.Kings Row is a beautiful film that finds the truimph of human spirit over physical tragedy shining through a bleak tapestry of insanity and sadism covering an old time slice of small town Americana.  Demonstrations of the irony of evil in contrast with it's nemesis are interweaved with a romantic story showing the need for, and humankind's early steps into, the field of psychiatry (pre-Freudian).  Some of the actors give their best performances ever here, including Robert Cummings, Betty Field, Charles Coburn, and Ronald Reagan in one of his most famous roles. Claude Rains is one of my favorite actors, and I'm tempted to say Dr. Tower is the role he was born to play; but Rains was equally ideal in a number of other roles, includig Here Comes Mr. Jordan and Notorious.I've seen King's Row four times over the years, and each time it means more to me.  The story is relatively complex, with many poignant plot turns, and some of the parallels, ironies and subtler themes are still emerging after repeated viewing.

306691,A1NVIEXCA20W7N,6302308208,Reliable Reviews Too,"[0, 1]","Set in a small town about 1900. The town has a group of children in wealthy families and another group of children in poor families; their neighborhoods are separated by the railroad-yard and railroad-tracks running through town. The children form friendships or rivalries due to financial status; then as adults; these relationships or rivalries continue.A prominent, big-city doctor has settled in the small town to shelter his wife, who is mentally-ill. The wife always stays in the house, upstairs. The man begins to become protective of his daughter Cassie (Betty Field).One wealthy young man, Parris, (Robert Cummings) aspires to be a pianist or doctor. His wealthy friend Drake (Ronald Reagan) is aimless in his career, and undecided in dating both a poor girl Randy Monaghan (Ann Sheridan), and a rich girl Louise Gordon (Nancy Coleman).(Reagan's) love interests, the adult rich girl, Louise Gordon, and the adult poor girl, Randy Monaghan, look a lot alike. This can be confusing if you do not watch diligently. The children clearly look poor or rich in the first part of the film. Later, the adult poor girl, Randy Monaghan, does not look poor as an adult. (Reagan) is also dating a third girl, a poor girl, Poppy Ross, who he talks about, but whom we never see after a glimpse of her and her sister and (Reagan) in a buggy early in the film. She doesn't look poor either, but sounds poor, using the word ""ain't"".The rich girl's father, Louise Gordon's father, a doctor too, strongly dislikes (Reagan), because (Reagan) dates other girls besides his daughter, and poor girls at that, and because (Reagan) has no job prospects, and is living off a trust-fund. The doctor/father lets (Reagan) know he despises him.The film is too subtle in showing the doctor/father of rich girl, Louise Gordon sees (Reagan) as an aimless, ne'er-do-well, playboy, womanizer; and that the doctor/father looks down on the poor.Multiple tragedies strike, and the friends are challenged to help one another.",4,"Father despises womanizing, bum, dating his daughter.",1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1994,"['Set', 'small', 'town', '1900', 'town', 'group', 'children', 'wealthy', 'families', 'group', 'children', 'poor', 'families', 'neighborhoods', 'are', 'separated', 'railroad-yard', 'railroad-tracks', 'running', 'town', 'children', 'form', 'friendships', 'rivalries', 'due', 'financial', 'status', 'then', 'adults', 'relationships', 'rivalries', 'continue.A', 'prominent', 'big-city', 'doctor', 'settled', 'small', 'town', 'shelter', 'wife', 'who', 'mentally-ill', 'wife', 'always', 'house', 'upstairs', 'man', 'become', 'protective', 'daughter', 'Cassie', 'Betty', 'Field', '.One', 'wealthy', 'young', 'man', 'Parris', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'be', 'pianist', 'doctor', 'wealthy', 'friend', 'Drake', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'aimless', 'career', 'undecided', 'dating', 'poor', 'girl', 'Randy', 'Monaghan', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'rich', 'girl', 'Louise', 'Gordon', 'Nancy', 'Coleman', 'Reagan', 'love', 'interests', 'adult', 'rich', 'girl', 'Louise', 'Gordon', 'adult', 'poor', 'girl', 'Randy', 'Monaghan', 'look', 'lot', 'alike', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'diligently', 'children', 'clearly', 'look', 'poor', 'rich', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'Later', 'adult', 'poor', 'girl', 'Randy', 'Monaghan', 'not', 'look', 'poor', 'adult', 'Reagan', 'also', 'dating', 'third', 'girl', 'poor', 'girl', 'Poppy', 'Ross', 'who', 'whom', 'never', 'see', 'glimpse', 'sister', 'Reagan', 'buggy', 'early', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'poor', 'poor', 'using', 'word', 'ai', ""n't"", '.The', 'rich', 'girl', 'father', 'Louise', 'Gordon', 'father', 'doctor', 'too', 'strongly', 'dislikes', 'Reagan', 'Reagan', 'other', 'girls', 'daughter', 'poor', 'girls', 'Reagan', 'job', 'prospects', 'living', 'off', 'trust-fund', 'doctor/father', 'Reagan', 'know', 'him.The', 'film', 'too', 'subtle', 'showing', 'doctor/father', 'rich', 'girl', 'Louise', 'Gordon', 'Reagan', 'aimless', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'playboy', 'womanizer', 'doctor/father', 'down', 'poor.Multiple', 'tragedies', 'strike', 'friends', 'are', 'challenged', 'help', 'one']",N/A
