Congratulations on the wonderfulness that is you.  Now, onto the movie. . . While often passed off just as a Christmas movie (and, don't get me wrong it should be watched at least twice every Holiday season), I also just watch this movie when I am a little down or feeling really happy already.  It will leave you warm and tingly for days.  I truly don't think the story could be any sweeter, or acted any more lovingly.  Now, it is easy to assume that such a sweet love story would be cheesy.  It's not, not at all.  However, it is the definition of innocence, which can be mistaken as cheesy.  The acting, as stated before, is perfect for the story, the one song she sings is haunting and will stay with you, the filming technique (while dated and not high quality) actually adds a warmth and dimension to the film.

When I found it was on DVD, I was thrilled to be able to buy it for my collection of Christmas movies.The story is based on a short story written by O. Henry, a writer of the late 19th century, called The Gift of the Magi.  This movie is a story set in the early 1900s, so the wardrobes and sets bring you back to a more romantic time.  It's about a young couple who fall in love against the wishes of family and out of line with proper associations between the classes.Marie Osmond is beautiful as the young Beth promised in marriage to a wealthy man she does not love.  She sings a beautiful song ""The Gift of Love"" upon which they drew the name of the movie.  Timothy Bottoms is Rudy, an immigrant from Switzerland (also destined to marry a girl he does not love).  In keeping with the original story, they both sacrifice the most valuable things they own to give a gift to the other.This is a love story made back in the day when a love story wasn't about sex, money, or a reality show.
