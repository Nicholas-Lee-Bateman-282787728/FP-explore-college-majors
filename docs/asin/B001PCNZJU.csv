For what ever reason I over looked the fact that they were both 47 Ronin story. I watched them back to back and I must confess I like both equally well.  Sort of like seeing two different groups do a Shakespear play.  I was so sure after the first one that this one could not do any better but I was wrong.

They show how dedicated and persistence they are regardless of how people who wanted them to avenge their master and leader were harsh on them.  The mother was upset that her son didn't avenge his master, the father in-law and other close people all were rejecting that these ronins weren't moving towards vengeance. But, these ronins were discreet and careful in their planning and finally succeeded.

1226954,A2IYRRHZMF49L1,B001PCNZJU,J  Tate,"[4, 4]","Bushido is alive and well in this movie. This is a retold tale of 47 Ronin (masterless Samurai) who seek revenge after their master (Lord Asano) is forced to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) after mildly assaulting a nasty court official. I have not seen any of the other versions of this tale to compare them to this film. As the title of the movie suggests this film is all about the complete loyalty and honor these Ronin feel in planning and staging the murder of the rude court official and the others responsible for their master's death.  Their planning for the attack lasts over a year and they do so knowing they will have to commit seppuku themselves for carrying out this crime. Dressed In Lord Asano's colors and insignia they avenge their master. There's something thrilling about seeing a sword fight take place against the timeless background of a wealthy, traditional Japanese home. This movie is more of a drama than an action movie as the action lasts a relatively short period of time compared to the long length of the movie.  The sets and costuming are impeccable, however the acting is sometimes a little over the top and melodramatic. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie though and would recommend it to those seeking a Samurai genre drama. This is definitely a keeper DVD for my movie library. I give it 4 stars. If you are looking for something in this genre with more blood spurting, limb chopping action then 13 Assassins by director Takeshi Miike would probably be more your cup of tea than this film.",4,"Loyalty, Honor and Revenge",1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,1524,"['Bushido', 'alive', 'well', 'movie', 'retold', 'tale', '47', 'Ronin', 'masterless', 'Samurai', 'who', 'seek', 'revenge', 'master', 'Lord', 'Asano', 'forced', 'commit', 'seppuku', 'ritual', 'suicide', 'mildly', 'assaulting', 'nasty', 'court', 'official', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'versions', 'tale', 'compare', 'film', 'title', 'movie', 'film', 'complete', 'loyalty', 'honor', 'Ronin', 'feel', 'planning', 'staging', 'murder', 'rude', 'court', 'official', 'others', 'responsible', 'master', 'death', 'planning', 'attack', 'over', 'year', 'do', 'so', 'knowing', 'will', 'have', 'commit', 'seppuku', 'carrying', 'out', 'crime', 'Dressed', 'Lord', 'Asano', 'colors', 'insignia', 'avenge', 'master', 'something', 'thrilling', 'seeing', 'sword', 'fight', 'take', 'place', 'timeless', 'background', 'wealthy', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'home', 'movie', 'more', 'drama', 'action', 'movie', 'action', 'relatively', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'compared', 'long', 'length', 'movie', 'sets', 'costuming', 'are', 'impeccable', 'however', 'acting', 'sometimes', 'little', 'top', 'melodramatic', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeking', 'Samurai', 'genre', 'drama', 'definitely', 'keeper', 'DVD', 'movie', 'library', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'genre', 'more', 'blood', 'spurting', 'limb', 'chopping', 'action', 'then', '13', 'Assassins', 'director', 'Takeshi', 'Miike', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'cup', 'tea', 'film']","Loyal 47 Ronin, The chushingura"
