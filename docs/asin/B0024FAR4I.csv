1249975,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B0024FAR4I,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","Sadly, the Prison Break series which started with a bang but kept slowly sliding downhill from the peaks of its glorious First Season, ends lamely with a double whimper. The Final Break is the second and final 'end' and, truly, nothing but what were meant to be the last 2 episodes of the series.I wish I could say that The Final Break at least stays true to the standards set by the 'seasoned' episodes but the viewing feels more like the series death by exhaustion. By the time we reach this final break, Sarah's - I'm not revealing anything that's not on the blurb printed on the back of the movie's case - everything and everyone, appear to be tired, bored, unconvincing, no longer having much fun. Yes, many of the old characters are back and we get to see the insides of a women's prison but, to borrow a line from an old commercial, this addition is 'less filling' without tasting that great. What in the previous episodes and in the early seasons was so outrageously impossible most of us would willingly suspend disbelief and have fun watching the escapes and plot twists is now almost ridiculously impossible and I found it impossible to relate to the characters any longer. I watched The Final Break with detachment, frequently checking the 'remaining time' counter. When it all ended, the feeling was of relief for it all being over. Finally.Concerning the Blu-ray release:- Once the disc begins play, you are greeted by what seems to be more than half a dozen (didn't count them) promos for some mediocre series and movies including some available on DVD only, not on Blu. You'll have to repeatedly 'skip' to get out of this inconvenience because you can't escape by pressing the 'menu' key. I hate when 'they' are trying to force us to watch their commercials after we actually pay for their product. This shows disrespect for the customer.- The picture quality is consistent to that of the 'regular' TV episodes - it's 'good'.- There is only one sound track option but the sound setup, interestingly, is part of the Setup menu - and you get to choose one out of the only one option available - the impression the 'menu' leaves is that all was thrown out to us, the indiscriminate 'consumers' very much on the cheap.- The 'extras' are made off 2 (two) deleted scenes and nothing else.- The plastic case has some strange perforations/holes that probably make it more likely to break and whose reasons is difficult to understand other than maybe saving a penny or two on plastic.That's just about it. Both my wife (a huge fan of the series) and myself are glad it's over. We are very likely to watch Season One and maybe some of the seasons that followed again but I can't see us re-watching The Final Break or the last few episodes of the last season.",2,The Final Disappointment,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,2764,"['Sadly', 'Prison', 'Break', 'series', 'started', 'bang', 'kept', 'slowly', 'sliding', 'downhill', 'peaks', 'glorious', 'First', 'Season', 'lamely', 'double', 'whimper', 'Final', 'Break', 'second', 'final', ""'end"", 'truly', 'nothing', 'what', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'last', '2', 'episodes', 'series.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'Final', 'Break', 'least', 'stays', 'true', 'standards', 'set', ""'seasoned"", 'episodes', 'viewing', 'more', 'series', 'death', 'exhaustion', 'time', 'reach', 'final', 'break', 'Sarah', ""'m"", 'not', 'revealing', 'anything', 'not', 'blurb', 'printed', 'back', 'movie', 'case', 'everything', 'everyone', 'appear', 'be', 'tired', 'bored', 'unconvincing', 'no', 'longer', 'having', 'much', 'fun', 'Yes', 'many', 'old', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'get', 'see', 'insides', 'women', 'prison', 'borrow', 'line', 'old', 'commercial', 'addition', ""'less"", 'filling', 'tasting', 'great', 'What', 'previous', 'episodes', 'early', 'seasons', 'was', 'so', 'outrageously', 'impossible', 'most', 'would', 'willingly', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'escapes', 'plot', 'twists', 'now', 'almost', 'ridiculously', 'impossible', 'found', 'impossible', 'relate', 'characters', 'longer', 'watched', 'Final', 'Break', 'detachment', 'frequently', 'checking', ""'remaining"", 'time', 'counter', 'When', 'ended', 'feeling', 'was', 'relief', 'being', 'over', 'Finally.Concerning', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'disc', 'play', 'are', 'greeted', 'what', 'be', 'more', 'dozen', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'promos', 'mediocre', 'series', 'movies', 'including', 'available', 'DVD', 'only', 'not', 'Blu', ""'ll"", 'have', 'repeatedly', ""'skip"", 'get', 'inconvenience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'pressing', ""'menu"", 'key', 'hate', 'when', ""'they"", 'are', 'trying', 'force', 'watch', 'commercials', 'actually', 'pay', 'product', 'disrespect', 'customer.-', 'picture', 'quality', 'consistent', ""'regular"", 'TV', 'episodes', ""'good'.-"", 'only', 'one', 'sound', 'track', 'option', 'sound', 'setup', 'interestingly', 'part', 'Setup', 'menu', 'get', 'choose', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'option', 'available', 'impression', ""'menu"", 'leaves', 'was', 'thrown', 'out', 'indiscriminate', ""'consumers"", 'very', 'much', 'cheap.-', ""'extras"", 'are', 'made', 'off', '2', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'else.-', 'plastic', 'case', 'strange', 'perforations/holes', 'probably', 'make', 'more', 'likely', 'break', 'reasons', 'difficult', 'understand', 'other', 'maybe', 'saving', 'penny', 'two', 'just', 'wife', 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'are', 'glad', 'over', 'are', 'very', 'likely', 'watch', 'Season', 'One', 'maybe', 'seasons', 'followed', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 're-watching', 'Final', 'Break', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'last', 'season']",N/A

It's a final hurray for the 4-season long show that started out strong and ran into ""creative difficulties"" at the end. These two hours fill in a few gaps that the series finale glanced over. This is definitely a movie for the die-hard fans, as there are character reveals and returning characters as well as the regulars acting in a predictable manner. This is not a stand-alone film. Anyone who has not been a fan of the show, even anyone who has skipped most of season 4, will not really understand what is going on in the storyline and why the leads are worth rooting for. My recommendation is to watch the series finale up to the ""Four Years Later"" sequence, then seeing Prison Break: The Final Break, then returning to the season finale and watching the last few minutes (the montage at the end).

1249997,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0024FAR4I,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 10]","The final episode of Prison Break ended with a ""4-Years Later"" title card and a startling revelation in the final shot. It could have ended there, leaving the audience to wonder how everything happened that way but the creators of Prison Break opted to create this 88-minute movie to tie up those gaping plot holes and clarify all the fan's unanswered questions. Gaping plot holes was never a big deal for Prison Break, but it was a nice gesture...However, as I'll explain, I wish they would've done it just a little differently.All the actor's/character's from the fourth season return for this, which takes place right before the four-year title card, but after the ""ending"" of the last episode. Without giving any details away, this film makes Sarah (Sarah Wayne Callies), the girlfriend of Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), the main character. All the plot holes are covered up with events surrounding her...It does a fine job of filling us in on questions we may have, but my one complaint will go over the head's of some. Even as Prison Break grew more and more ludicrous, I found that it never lost its ability to excite and entertain. It was always a drama as it's core, hinging much of it's success on the love audiences had for it's characters, but few shows have made my heart race the way Prison Break did. This movie had 80-minutes to wrap up a series and seemed more of a way to just get everything out of the way than tell a story. The way that it favors dramatic elements over exciting elements would have made it one of the weaker episodes had it actually been a part of the fourth season.For those reading this, keep in mind that this is intended only for those who have watched all four seasons including the series finale. This is not a stand-alone film and will make little or no sense to those with little or no familiarity with the series.If you're a fan, this is essential viewing. That last shot of the series opens up a lot of questions and I'm sure you'll want to see what went down to cause that, but therein lies another problem. If you did watch that final episode, you'll notice a major lack-of-suspense due to the knowledge you have about the character this movie hinges on. It's that character that really eliminates all suspense, but all who have seen that final episode know the fate of all these characters. Yes, this shows how they got there but the knowledge we have makes everything a lot less effective.At 88-minutes, it's obviously a bit simplified on top of everything else but there are moments that do contain a sort of dramatic poignancy, particularly the final scene which in it's own simple way brings more closure to the series than the actual ending did. As I said, this is essential viewing for fans of the series but hardly an essential release. I think everything from here could have been initially incorporated into the actual series, but perhaps done differently. With that said, The Final Break will clarify anything that had you scratching your head when that last episode faded to black...But you won't necessarily like it.GRADE: B-",4,"Essential Viewing for Fans, But Nothing Special",1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,3093,"['final', 'episode', 'Prison', 'Break', 'ended', '4-Years', 'Later', 'title', 'card', 'startling', 'revelation', 'final', 'shot', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'there', 'leaving', 'audience', 'wonder', 'how', 'everything', 'happened', 'way', 'creators', 'Prison', 'Break', 'opted', 'create', '88-minute', 'movie', 'tie', 'up', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'clarify', 'fan', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'Gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'deal', 'Prison', 'Break', 'was', 'nice', 'gesture', 'However', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'just', 'little', 'differently.All', ""actor's/character"", 'fourth', 'season', 'return', 'place', 'right', 'four-year', 'title', 'card', 'ending', 'last', 'episode', 'giving', 'details', 'away', 'film', 'Sarah', 'Sarah', 'Wayne', 'Callies', 'girlfriend', 'Michael', 'Scofield', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'main', 'character', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'covered', 'up', 'events', 'surrounding', 'fine', 'job', 'filling', 'questions', 'may', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'will', 'go', 'head', 'Even', 'Prison', 'Break', 'grew', 'more', 'more', 'ludicrous', 'found', 'never', 'lost', 'ability', 'excite', 'entertain', 'was', 'always', 'drama', 'core', 'hinging', 'much', 'success', 'love', 'audiences', 'had', 'characters', 'few', 'shows', 'have', 'made', 'heart', 'race', 'way', 'Prison', 'Break', 'did', 'movie', 'had', '80-minutes', 'wrap', 'up', 'series', 'seemed', 'more', 'way', 'just', 'get', 'everything', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'way', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'exciting', 'elements', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'part', 'fourth', 'season.For', 'reading', 'keep', 'mind', 'intended', 'only', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'four', 'seasons', 'including', 'series', 'finale', 'not', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'little', 'familiarity', 'series.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'essential', 'viewing', 'last', 'shot', 'series', 'up', 'lot', 'questions', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'what', 'went', 'down', 'cause', 'therein', 'problem', 'did', 'watch', 'final', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'major', 'lack-of-suspense', 'due', 'knowledge', 'have', 'character', 'movie', 'character', 'really', 'suspense', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'final', 'episode', 'know', 'fate', 'characters', 'Yes', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'knowledge', 'have', 'everything', 'lot', 'less', 'effective.At', '88-minutes', 'obviously', 'bit', 'simplified', 'top', 'everything', 'else', 'are', 'moments', 'do', 'contain', 'sort', 'dramatic', 'poignancy', 'particularly', 'final', 'scene', 'own', 'simple', 'way', 'more', 'closure', 'series', 'actual', 'ending', 'did', 'said', 'essential', 'viewing', 'fans', 'series', 'hardly', 'essential', 'release', 'think', 'everything', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'initially', 'incorporated', 'actual', 'series', 'perhaps', 'done', 'differently', 'said', 'Final', 'Break', 'will', 'clarify', 'anything', 'had', 'scratching', 'head', 'when', 'last', 'episode', 'faded', 'black', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'it.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

The writers did a very good job tying loose ends.  Great finish to a great series!!!First off, I know many fans of the show did not like the end of season 4. I, myself, thought it was a great ending....however, I still felt like something was still missing....Michael's death went too fast, unexplained.  Well, this movie does indeed make a much better ending to the series than the end of the 4th season did.The subject of Michaels death leaves me to my next point. The end of the 4th season finale makes you to believe Michael was sentence to death by health reasons.  Although this does play out a little in the movie, the whole idea of Michael's death is blow away in a totally different aspect....which the writers have successfully proved Michael's character of ""sacrificing himself to help others in his life"" throughout the whole series. Kuddo's to the writers!!! And I know, fans wanted more of a ""happy ending"", but at the end of this movie, despite Michael's demise, it really is a happy ending because it is what the central character wanted....Michaels decision alone....which stayed true to his character throughout the series.  Like someone else mentioned earlier...the movie is similar to a Shakespearan type novel....like a Romeo & Juliet feeling to the story.Also I would like to point out, that if you are a fan of the 1st season (the best season, in my opinion), this movie has a very close resemblance to the first season.  It is VERY ACTION PACKED, and has that same intense feeling you got when watching the 1st season. Very enjoyable!!!  In fact the action is so ongoing....I didn't think the movie would have a satisfying finish....but it does.Another last note....the movie also reveals the question ""What ever happen to Gretchen?"".  Which was nice to see that they tied her character's story line better than they did in the 4th season. She was always a favorite character of mine.All and all, I highly recommend this movie!! It definitely ties the loose ends that the 4th Season finale left us...with a better explanation to Michael's demise.  Prison Break: The Final Break, has a much more satisfying ending!!! Mainly due to the fact that the central character (Michael) remained true to himself thru out the entire series. Michael was in control of his decisions, no matter what sacrifice he had to do.....making the ultimate sacrifice to the end of this great series.

When I heard this movie was coming out, I was very excited about it and just had to get it.Perhaps my expectations were too high for this movie, but it wasn't what I expected. It was good, since it wraps everything up from the series, but the movie was just very predictable. It was almost as if I knew what was going to happen before it did, and already knowing Michael died didn't help much.All in all, if you are a Prison Break fan, you have to watch this movie. I would recommend you rent it versus buying it, but I bought it and don't regret it. I am very fond of the actors and buying this is like having the last peice of Prison Break out there.Still, it was like a very crammed TV episode. I never thought I would say this, but the TV show with the commercials actually made it more interesting. Having no commericals, there was never really any suspense as to what was going to happen. Things just kept on going until the end.",3,"Sadly.....this is Good, but not Great :-(",1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,1133,"['am', 'huge', 'Priosn', 'Break', 'fan', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'when', 'Fox', 'decided', 'cancel', 'show', 'mean', 'would', 'watch', 'show', 'matter', 'where', 'were', 'breaking', 'could', 'have', 'been', '7-11', 'care', 'When', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'it.Perhaps', 'expectations', 'were', 'too', 'high', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'good', 'everything', 'up', 'series', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'predictable', 'was', 'almost', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'did', 'already', 'knowing', 'Michael', 'died', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'much.All', 'are', 'Prison', 'Break', 'fan', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'rent', 'buying', 'bought', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'am', 'very', 'fond', 'actors', 'buying', 'having', 'last', 'peice', 'Prison', 'Break', 'out', 'there.Still', 'was', 'very', 'crammed', 'TV', 'episode', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'say', 'TV', 'show', 'commercials', 'actually', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'Having', 'commericals', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'suspense', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Things', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'end']",N/A

I think many fans are disgusted because to add insult to injury, the writers gave us an unrecognizable Prison Break in Season 4 (see my review); and a 2-hour sales pitch to the network for doing a show on a woman's prison, with this Final Break segment.I feel cheated by the writers, not because they didn't give me a happy ending, but because they gave me a stupid one in this Final Break and Season 4 fiascos, after creating one of the best shows of television history.",2,The Final Break for a series that was already broken.,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,1836,"['******SPOILERS*********SPOILERS********SPOILERS*******SPOILERSAfter', 'watching', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Season', '4', 'had', 'desire', 'watch', '2-hour', 'addition', 'just', 'wanted', 'complete', 'circle.I', 'have', 'read', 'was', 'made', 'network', 'gave', 'ok', '2', 'additional', 'episodes', 'announcing', 'show', 'was', 'canceled.This', 'sequel', 'short', 'period', 'moment', 'team', 'back', 'Scylla', '4-year', 'anniversary', 'Michael', 'death', 'how', 'Michael', 'Sarah', 'woman', 'prison.If', 'just', 'consider', 'whole', 'team', 'was', 'given', 'full', 'immunity', 'getting', 'Scylla', 'back', 'edition', 'utterly', 'absurd', 'insult', 'show', 'fans.I', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'actors', 'continue', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'more', 'line', 'fast', 'pace', 'rhythm', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'tried', 'give', 'solace', 'many', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'devastated', 'Michael', 'death', 'showing', 'died', 'honorably', 'own', 'choice', 'sacrificing', 'life', 'Sarah', 'freedom.I', 'am', 'one', 'fans', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'fact', 'Michael', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'Season', '4', 'can', 'accept', 'sometimes', 'are', 'creative', 'decisions', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'with.If', 'Season', '4', 'including', 'Final', 'Break', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'intelligent', 'not', 'so', 'full', 'inconsistencies', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'lines', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'willing', 'accept', 'Michael', 'death', 'think', 'many', 'fans', 'are', 'disgusted', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'writers', 'gave', 'unrecognizable', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Season', '4', 'see', 'review', '2-hour', 'sales', 'pitch', 'network', 'doing', 'show', 'woman', 'prison', 'Final', 'Break', 'segment.I', 'feel', 'cheated', 'writers', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'happy', 'ending', 'gave', 'stupid', 'one', 'Final', 'Break', 'Season', '4', 'fiascos', 'creating', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'history']",N/A

The General finds out and while in prison himself, orders a hit on her.

1250017,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0024FAR4I,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","For 4 years, Prison Break was the smartest, grittiest, best casted, and best written show on Television. While badly harmed by the 2007 writers strike and low ratings, this show never did get the recognition it deserved. When Paul Scheuring created the show, he wrote a story he'd planned to last six season, however in the middle of season 4, he pulled the plug. Scheuring decided that the show had become a farce of itself and would not longer continue. In the final 15 minutes of the last episode of season 4, they jumped ahead 3 years to the ending Scheuring had originally envisioned, and it left fans with millions of unanswered questions. They were outraged and besieged the network with letters. The result, the events of a hypothetical season 6 were condensed into a 90 minute movie. The movie was a return to the shows beginnings and was terrific! While season 4 did get stupid, this would have been a fantastic season and an amazing way to end the show. Of course when you condense 24 episodes into an hour and a half, it's going to be rushed and have holes, but they do a nice job of trying to explain everything and ultimately do give the fans the closure they desired. This was the smartest show I've ever seen and no matter what this cast does for the rest of their careers, it will never compare to the incredible job they did on this show and in this movie.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,1374,"['4', 'years', 'Prison', 'Break', 'was', 'smartest', 'grittiest', 'best', 'casted', 'best', 'written', 'show', 'Television', 'badly', 'harmed', '2007', 'writers', 'strike', 'low', 'ratings', 'show', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'recognition', 'deserved', 'When', 'Paul', 'Scheuring', 'created', 'show', 'wrote', 'story', ""'d"", 'planned', 'last', 'six', 'season', 'however', 'middle', 'season', '4', 'pulled', 'plug', 'Scheuring', 'decided', 'show', 'had', 'become', 'farce', 'would', 'not', 'longer', 'continue', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'last', 'episode', 'season', '4', 'jumped', 'ahead', '3', 'years', 'ending', 'Scheuring', 'had', 'originally', 'envisioned', 'left', 'fans', 'millions', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'were', 'outraged', 'besieged', 'network', 'letters', 'result', 'events', 'hypothetical', 'season', '6', 'were', 'condensed', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'return', 'shows', 'beginnings', 'was', 'terrific', 'season', '4', 'did', 'get', 'stupid', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'season', 'amazing', 'way', 'end', 'show', 'course', 'when', 'condense', '24', 'episodes', 'hour', 'half', 'going', 'be', 'rushed', 'have', 'holes', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'trying', 'explain', 'everything', 'ultimately', 'do', 'give', 'fans', 'closure', 'desired', 'was', 'smartest', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'matter', 'what', 'cast', 'rest', 'careers', 'will', 'never', 'compare', 'incredible', 'job', 'did', 'show', 'movie']",N/A
