The film quality is not better than what cable's western encore station showed, they slipped in and out of degrees of clarity and the ending credits go back and forth in picture size as though a zoom button was employed and turned off and pressed again. I wanted the series because i have fond memories of watching it as a child and every time I hear the song it gives me and warm and fuzzy feeling. And Gene Barry is...well Gene Barry. I have top notch equipment which elevates dvd quality but it couldn't perform any miracles. If you decide to buy it because other reviewers say the newly issued individual series sets by a different company are truly terrible be forewarned about this complete series set........This is why fans of old tv westerns should appreciate what Paramount has done with Gunsmoke and provided fans with the most prisitine looking film quality.Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series",2,not as good as hyped,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,1090,"['reviews', 'were', 'quite', 'convincing', 'quality', 'episodes', 'were', 'extremely', 'good', 'having', 'watched', 'first', 'disk', 'i', 'am', 'bewildered', 'people', 'claims', 'film', 'quality', 'not', 'better', 'what', 'cable', 'western', 'encore', 'station', 'showed', 'slipped', 'degrees', 'clarity', 'ending', 'credits', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'picture', 'size', 'zoom', 'button', 'was', 'employed', 'turned', 'off', 'pressed', 'again', 'wanted', 'series', 'i', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'watching', 'child', 'time', 'hear', 'song', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'well', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'have', 'top', 'notch', 'equipment', 'dvd', 'quality', 'could', ""n't"", 'perform', 'miracles', 'decide', 'buy', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'newly', 'issued', 'individual', 'series', 'sets', 'different', 'company', 'are', 'truly', 'terrible', 'be', 'forewarned', 'complete', 'series', 'set', '..This', 'why', 'fans', 'old', 'tv', 'westerns', 'should', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Paramount', 'done', 'Gunsmoke', 'provided', 'fans', 'most', 'prisitine', 'looking', 'film', 'quality.Bloodspiller', 'Book', 'One', 'Warriors', 'Palahia', 'Series']",BAT MASTERSON-11 DVD BOXED SET-108 EPISODES IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER-COMPLETE SERIES-RICH BLACK AND WHITE
