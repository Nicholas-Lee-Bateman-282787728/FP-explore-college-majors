I wasn't sure what to expect, but Dear Santa turned out to be one of those 'cute' Christmas movies.  There is a good humor element to it, the touching aspect of it and will bring a tear to the eye by the end.  The story is somewhat predictable, but it does not detract from it being an enjoyable movie.  It is different in the story aspect that Amy's character finds a letter and fashions her own response to it.I was pleasantly surprised by something I thought might be a problem.  The chef in the movie definitely comes off homosexual, so I thought this movie would have a Hollywood-based, liberal agenda to it.  As it turned out, the chef turns out to be the 'loveable gay guy'.  His character helps Amy's character get steered in the right direction.  So, give this aspect of the movie a chance.  This is coming from a die-hard conservative, former-Christian guy.I have read the 2-star review on here.  As a former Christian who is back to being an agnostic, I am not as bothered to hear god d**n in a movie like I once was.  However, I have to think it was not well used in the movie.

1463479,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005K1VPY4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[14, 18]","Sentimental, cheesy, predictable, yeah... but also pretty wonderful. Of the deluge of Christmas films that shower us during the holiday season, DEAR SANTA manages not to be too cloying or excessively silly. Having seen Amy Acker only as the shy, studious Fred in ANGEL, it's a bit jarring to eyeball her as she takes on a frivolous character like Crystal. Except that there's this innate likability about Amy Acker, and a captivating quirkiness. She's lovely but unprepossessing. She's smart but she doesn't flaunt it. Even playing a spoiled socialite, she exudes warmth.Threatened to get cut off by her wealthy parents, Crystal, a 30-year-old, irresponsible, incurable shopaholic, has until Christmas to demonstrate that she's gotten her act together, that she could be productive or at least settle down with a good man. When a fortuitous gust floats a stray ""Dear Santa"" letter in her direction, she sees her prospects opening up. The letter is from earnest seven-year-old Olivia (Emma Duke) who asks Santa for a new wife for her widowed dad Derek (David Haydn-Jones). You have to credit Acker at this stage. A different actress could've come off as horrifyingly mercenary here. But there's a sweetness to Acker.In ensuing segments, Crystal - and, honestly, there's no more applicable verb - stalks Derek and Olivia, and she's encouraged by what she sees. Trailing Derek into a local soup kitchen, she inadvertently bumps into him and is promptly recruited to bread duty at the food service line. She learns that not only is Derek raising a daughter by himself and running a snow plowing business, he also operates the struggling soup kitchen, the legacy of his dead wife and a project that Derek had sworn to keep solvent. You can't fault Crystal for falling for him. It helps that she gets along really well with young Olivia.DEAR SANTA benefits from a cast that performs with restraint. The characters' interactions are believable, with Acker effortlessly anchoring the whole thing. She inhabits her role, overcoming what could readily have been a clich&eacute;d character. Crystal, once you get past the opening minutes and the shallow rich girl stereotype, comes across as a living, breathing, good-hearted person. A self-assured Jason Priestley (yes, that Jason Priestley) directs the film and avoids wandering into over-the-top territory. The kid, Emma Duke, is very good and doesn't try to be cute or precocious. Priestley also exhibits a good eye for cinematography. Somehow, the sets never feel like sets. The plot won't bowl you over with anything stupendous or revolutionary. But the narrative stays even-keeled, other than an impromptu food fight that erupts from a staid brunch and a tiresome shopping sequence.And if you were wondering who sings that melodic slow song playing in the background near the end, her name is Jocelyn Alice and the song is ""Tonight."" I'm mentioning this because it took me a while to track down the tune.Several conflicts spring up, but we don't really sweat it. It's that kind of movie. Unpaid bills threaten to shut down the soup kitchen by Christmas eve. Crystal hasn't yet told Derek and Olivia that she has Olivia's letter. And then there's Derek's calculating girlfriend (a terrific Gina Holden) who accurately perceives Crystal as competition.Patrick Creery has a breezy supporting role as the stylish soup kitchen chef who acts as matchmaker. Who knew a smart fashion sense can save Christmas and land a girl a blue-collar hunk? Liberated women may or may not tear out their hair, but this is a fun romantic comedy for the holidays.",4,How Amy Acker saved Christmas... and kept her allowance,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,3586,"['Sentimental', 'cheesy', 'predictable', 'yeah', 'also', 'pretty', 'wonderful', 'deluge', 'Christmas', 'films', 'shower', 'holiday', 'season', 'DEAR', 'SANTA', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'cloying', 'excessively', 'silly', 'Having', 'seen', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'only', 'shy', 'studious', 'Fred', 'ANGEL', 'bit', 'jarring', 'eyeball', 'frivolous', 'character', 'Crystal', 'innate', 'likability', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'captivating', 'quirkiness', 'lovely', 'unprepossessing', 'smart', ""n't"", 'flaunt', 'Even', 'playing', 'spoiled', 'socialite', 'warmth.Threatened', 'get', 'cut', 'off', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'Crystal', '30-year-old', 'irresponsible', 'incurable', 'shopaholic', 'Christmas', 'demonstrate', 'gotten', 'act', 'together', 'could', 'be', 'productive', 'least', 'settle', 'down', 'good', 'man', 'When', 'fortuitous', 'gust', 'floats', 'stray', 'Dear', 'Santa', 'letter', 'direction', 'prospects', 'opening', 'up', 'letter', 'earnest', 'seven-year-old', 'Olivia', 'Emma', 'Duke', 'who', 'Santa', 'new', 'wife', 'widowed', 'dad', 'Derek', 'David', 'Haydn-Jones', 'have', 'credit', 'Acker', 'stage', 'different', 'actress', 'could', ""'ve"", 'come', 'off', 'horrifyingly', 'mercenary', 'here', 'sweetness', 'Acker.In', 'ensuing', 'segments', 'Crystal', 'honestly', 'more', 'applicable', 'verb', 'stalks', 'Derek', 'Olivia', 'encouraged', 'what', 'Trailing', 'Derek', 'local', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'inadvertently', 'bumps', 'promptly', 'recruited', 'bread', 'duty', 'food', 'service', 'line', 'not', 'only', 'Derek', 'raising', 'daughter', 'running', 'snow', 'plowing', 'business', 'also', 'struggling', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'legacy', 'dead', 'wife', 'project', 'Derek', 'had', 'sworn', 'keep', 'solvent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Crystal', 'falling', 'along', 'really', 'well', 'young', 'Olivia.DEAR', 'SANTA', 'benefits', 'cast', 'restraint', 'characters', 'interactions', 'are', 'believable', 'Acker', 'effortlessly', 'anchoring', 'whole', 'thing', 'role', 'overcoming', 'what', 'could', 'readily', 'have', 'been', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'character', 'Crystal', 'once', 'get', 'opening', 'minutes', 'shallow', 'rich', 'girl', 'stereotype', 'across', 'living', 'breathing', 'good-hearted', 'person', 'self-assured', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'yes', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'film', 'avoids', 'wandering', 'over-the-top', 'territory', 'kid', 'Emma', 'Duke', 'very', 'good', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'cute', 'precocious', 'Priestley', 'also', 'good', 'eye', 'cinematography', 'Somehow', 'sets', 'never', 'feel', 'sets', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bowl', 'anything', 'stupendous', 'revolutionary', 'narrative', 'stays', 'even-keeled', 'other', 'impromptu', 'food', 'fight', 'staid', 'brunch', 'tiresome', 'shopping', 'sequence.And', 'were', 'wondering', 'who', 'melodic', 'slow', 'song', 'playing', 'background', 'end', 'name', 'Jocelyn', 'Alice', 'song', 'Tonight', ""'m"", 'mentioning', 'took', 'while', 'track', 'down', 'tune.Several', 'conflicts', 'spring', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'sweat', 'kind', 'movie', 'Unpaid', 'bills', 'threaten', 'shut', 'down', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'Crystal', ""n't"", 'yet', 'told', 'Derek', 'Olivia', 'Olivia', 'letter', 'then', 'Derek', 'calculating', 'girlfriend', 'terrific', 'Gina', 'Holden', 'who', 'accurately', 'Crystal', 'competition.Patrick', 'Creery', 'breezy', 'supporting', 'role', 'stylish', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'chef', 'who', 'matchmaker', 'Who', 'knew', 'smart', 'fashion', 'sense', 'can', 'save', 'Christmas', 'land', 'girl', 'blue-collar', 'hunk', 'Liberated', 'women', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'tear', 'out', 'hair', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'holidays']",Dear Santa

1463485,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005K1VPY4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Actor Jason Priestley takes the directorial reins on the Canadian feature ""Dear Santa."" I'm not entirely sure if this film was produced for television, but it certainly seems to have been. Every year, cable stations around the broadcast dial produce numerous pleasant, if unremarkable, films filled with holiday cheer, gentle comedy, moralistic lessons, and a dash of romance for good measure. They are virtually inescapable. And honestly, they are pretty interchangeable as well. ""Dear Santa"" is a slight but well meaning endeavor that holds no surprises if you've ever seen a TV movie of a similar ilk--but it is likable enough if you don't have lofty expectations. Here's the catch, though--while I might glance at these films to fritter away some time when they're on television for free, would I really spend money to own one? In the case of ""Dear Santa,"" I probably wouldn't. And yet, it still fulfills the purpose it was designed for so I can't judge it too harshly. If you have a soft spot for holiday entertainment, you can do worse (but you can also do better).Amy Acker plays the spoiled rich girl who needs life lessons this holiday season. She lives for two purposes--to shop and to find a man. But the movie is so sketchy on the details and props, Acker is never particularly convincing as this type of character. Examples: She drives an SUV, has generic spices in her kitchen, chases a man who drives a snow plow--it's not exactly Paris Hilton here. One day as she bemoans not having a man in her life, a letter to Santa blows into her path. A little girl is asking that her father find a new wife for Christmas. Sounds perfect! The man (David Haydn-Jones) is a working class dream as the snow plow driver and as a homeless food kitchen benefactor. The fact that he could never support Acker's upscale tastes is never even mentioned. Acker relentlessly chases this stranger, blithely taking a job at the kitchen. Can she win her man? Will the secret of the letter be exposed? Will she become a better person? Can a struggling family find happiness again? If you are in doubt to any of the answers, you don't watch many TV movies.Acker has an offbeat charm that is quite appealing and Haydn-Jones is solid enough. Neither character, however, is developed very believably. He even has a girlfriend (who, of course, is evil incarnate) whom his daughter hates, but he thinks she is mother material despite this fact. The homeless people provide a chance for displays of good will and charity--just what you need for an uplifting tale of holiday learning.

1463490,A36C6WVZKSG4XB,B005K1VPY4,merm,"[4, 8]","This is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies.  I am still watching it and it's March!!  The plot is so very good and the actors and actresses are great.  It is a movie about a young lady about 30 years old who had not spent many Christmas or special times with her parents.  Her mother goes with her father on business trips.  Crystal's parents have been supporting her until now but have given her until Christmas to turn her life around.  It's Christmas time and Amber is buying all sorts of clothes for parties and such.  So...she had her list and was on her way to buy more outfits when she saw a dress in the window of a store she obviously shopped at often.  The mail man was getting the mail out of a box there in front of the store where Amber was looking.  A letter flew right in Amber's path and she caught the letter.  Looking at the red dress made her put the letter in her pocket and she went on shopping.She was home and she remembered to look at the letter and she opened it.  The letter was from a young girl and she was not asking for any gift for herself but she wanted a wife for her father.  Someone beautiful and nice so they could have a family again. Her father and Olivia had been sad since his wife and her mom passed a year this Christmas.  Amber took the contents of the letter very seriously so she found the return address and drove tho their house to see the little girl and her father.  After some stops here and there Amber follows Derek to a 'soup kitchen' which his wife had started when she was alive and he promised to keep it going as long as possible.  Amber stops and goes in to see where Derek had led her.At this point the movie is set mostly at the 'soup kitchen' and it shows a spoiled but beautiful young lady doing work she had never done in her life but she found it very rewarding and she saw Olivia, the young girl at the kitchen and they became close.  Amber and Olivia were not fond of Derek's so called girl friend, Jillian.  As time goes by Amber works closely with Derek and they did things together like taking Olivia to get new clothes.  Her father had not noticed his daughter's clothes had become old looking.The movie becomes a fight between Jillian and Crystal for Derek.  Crystal did not tell Derek about the letter she found but had told the chef at the 'soup kitchen' and both him and Amber thought it was 'fate' that is getting them together.  Jillian looks through Crystals purse and finds the letter.  Derek was very angry with Amber but then things turned when Amber has the money to pull the 'soup kitchen' out of being closed for unpaid bills of ten thousand dollars.  Amber's mom and dad sent her ten thousand dollars for Christmas and to hold her over to get started supporting herself.  The little girl, Olivia becomes very angry with her father since he was angry with Amber and he would not let Olivia talk with her.  Olivia ends up going to a huge Christmas tree where she and her mom once sent up wishes.  She left without telling her dad or anyone.  When he finds his little girl all things become clear to all parties.  Somehow Olivia, Amber and Derek end up at the same place THIS IS ONE GREAT MOVIE.

It's pretty much by the numbers but it is amusing and the actors make up for the weak and at times, non-sensical, plot- such is the genre.Amy Acker plays a shopaholic, aimless, daffy, young woman whose rich mother gives her the ultimatum: get responsible, i.e., find a man, find a job, or else she'll cut her off, money-wise.  By magical chance, she finds a letter to Santa from a young girl who wants a wife for her dedicated and loving father(Haydn-Jones).The remaining story involves the heroine pursuing him, competing with his not-really-meant-for-him girlfriend, learning compassion while working at a homeless shelter and bonding with the daughter.What makes this story at all worthwhile are the character interactions; especially, the young actor(Emma Duke) who portrays the daughter.  She's terrific!  The comedy's mildly amusing; there's a lot of cattiness between the women which some might find entertaining(my wife thinks showing fighting over a man promotes the wrong ideas for women.  Hmmm, I'll have to think about that.  No, no, of course, she's right!)It's a clean holiday, family friendly story.  I'd give 3-3 1/2 stars, 4 stars for the warm, moving scenes with the daughter.
