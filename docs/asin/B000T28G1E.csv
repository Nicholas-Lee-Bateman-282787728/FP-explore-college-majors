A lot happens in a short amount of time - there's a lot of action, new characters are constantly appearing, and it seems like you're always learning something new about the world of Bleach. It's beautiful.One of my favorite features is that you can either watch it dubbed in English, or in it's original Japanese with English subtitles. I prefer watching it in Japanese, but the English dubs are very well-done.

This is definitely one of my personal favorites (others include Naruto and Death Note...in case you were looking for more animes like Bleach). I won't summarize the story for you, I'll just say that it should probably be PG-13 because of some blood and minor swearing. It is an excellent action show with one of the best stories I've seen in an anime.

1088089,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000T28G1E,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","I have been a fan of anime since I was a kid and all we had was Thundercats, Gundam (the original), Speed Racer, and Battle of the Planets.  I've stuck with the genre through adulthood, and have enjoyed a variety of series.  I really have to say that I was apprehensive about watching this series due to the overwhelming teen love for it, but I figured that I like Dragon Ball Z even now (and started watching it in my teens, hence giving that series my teen love!), so what could it hurt to check it out?I must say, while it is definitely skewed towards a young adult crowd, I really have enjoyed this series.  It doesn't really remind me of Dragon Ball Z as other reviews have stated.  Instead it reminds me a bit of various other series kind of mashed into one.  There are scenes and episodes that remind me of Crono Crusade, Samurai Champloo, My-Hime, Melancholy of Haruhi Suzuyama, and even High School Rumble.  There is a great balance of action, drama, and comedy.The action is central to the series, but it's not all there is (which is great).  Often the action involves many other periphery events, such as people Ichigo is trying to protect, or particular Hollows that are more than just a faceless spirit.  Speaking of, I won't really get into the details, as this review would be far too long.  But let's just say this series is kind of a modern, high school series with action, intrigue, and evil spirits that only certain people can see and interact with.The comedy is often over the top and sometimes a bit unfathomable (even knowing a good amount of Japanese culture, there were some rather interesting father/daughter interactions...).  The comedy between Rukia and Ichigo is rather amusing, as are her descriptive drawings.  Often there are brief comedic spurts inserted even into the more serious scenes which give the series a kind of light heartedness even when things are grim (think sword tied to top of head with handkerchief to use as spirit energy vessel during major battle).But there is enough going on to entertain even an adult.  There are some things which irk me a bit (Orihime for one), and there are some cheesy lines on occasion, but it's overall a good series and one that I enjoy.  It's not the best, but it's surprisingly addictive and entertaining.  I highly recommend watching it, no matter what age you are.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Ichigo Kurosaki is just your average teenage boy... except that he can see spirits.So it's not exactly surprising that he gets involved in wild, dangerous adventures, in the first season of the hilarious, action-packed ""Bleach."" It starts off a bit slow, but rapidly winds into a thrilling, expansive adventure story, with lots of big swords, roaring monsters, and TV psychics.One night a strange girl appears in Ichigo's bedroom, and is shocked when he can see her. She explains that she's a Soul Reaper, who helps the dead pass on to the Soul Society, and destroys evil spirits called Hollows.But when Rukia is injured in a fight with a Hollow, all her powers are transferred to Ichigo -- and with them, the responsibility of killing Hollows. Ichigo soon finds out that it isn't easy juggling his new responsibilities with his normal, everyday life -- especially since the powerless Rukia is now attending his school, and living in his closet.Even more distressing, his new powers are attracting all sorts of trouble: the Hollow who murdered his mother, the now-monstrous brother of his ditzy friend Orihime, an outspoken ""mod-soul,"" and classmate Uryu-- the last of the Quincys, sworn enemies of Soul Reapers. Moreover, Orihime and the gentle giant Chad start developing spiritual powers of their own.But then two powerful Soul Reapers show up to arrest Rukia. Ichigo is left mortally wounded and robbed of his powers, while Rukia is taken back to the Soul Society to be executed. To rescue Rukia, Ichigo agrees to undergo a terribly training regimen that could leave him worse than dead... and the journey into the Soul Society may be even worse...Most long-running series run out their welcome pretty quickly, or start following a formula. But ""Bleach"" has that magical mix of complex plot, kinetic action, likable characters and kooky comedy. Not only does it click, but the results are sort of a mad hybrid of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" and ""Inuyasha."" Its biggest problem? The first season ends with a cliffhanger the size of the Grand Canyon.To keep us entertained, there's lots of action, monsters, blood, giant magical swords, spirit arrows and even a skyscraper-sized Hollow. But the writers keep an eye on the characters, and the first arc is used to establish them -- we get to see their pasts, their motivations, and why they want to fight Hollows. Even if it's simply a desire to do what's right and protect others.And just as important important -- comedy. Every episode of ""Bleach"" has some comedy, whether it's crazy friends and/or relatives, TV appearances, or the wacky dialogue (""OH NO! I'M FRIENDS WITH A NERD! Maybe you need some thick nerd glasses...""). Even Ichigo produces some hilarious moments, such as his bloodcurdling scream when he wakes in Urahara's house.Ichigo himself is the pivot of the whole series -- like many a good anime hero, he is rough, brash, sensitive and fights for those he loves. And though he's incredibly powerful, he still has a lot of training, fighting and learning to do, though he tends to jump in without thinking about it.And he's backed by a colourful squad of characters: the prickly Uryu, quiet Chad, ditzy love interest Orihime, and the mysterious ""Mr. Hat and Clogs"" who trains Ichigo to be a full-fledged Soul Reaper. Not to mention Kon, a living lion doll who provides plenty of comic relief, whether he's getting bounced around the room or dressed as Marie Antoinette.""Bleach's"" first season introduces viewers to a brilliant series, full of hilarity, tears, blood and big, bad monsters.

It was one of the big 3 or top 3 shonens next to naruto(Very popular) and one piece (my favorite out of the 3 but least popular ) . im reviewing bleach. you might be thinking ""2 stars? have you  even watched it?"" yes and read the manga enough to know the basic plot. if you want to know more about the story go search it. I like bleach alot but the reason i gave it two stars is how the story flows in the anime .

1088101,A6X2527BQO8B4,B000T28G1E,GuardianSoulBlade,"[0, 1]","Bleach is a great Anime, It's full of action/adventure and humor.  The story is about Ichigo Kurosaki, a 15-year-old high school student who can see spirits, when he meets Rukia Kouchki, he his thrust into a world of monsters called Hollows, and Soul Reapers who fight them and guide souls to the Soul Society, the afterlife in the Anime.One of the reasons I enjoy the show is because of the excellent voice acting.  Johnny Von Bach is a great voice actor who conveys real emotion with only the script and his voice.  The other voice actor that I like is Derek Stephen Prince, who voiced Ken Ichijouji in the Digimon Anime.  He's an excellent choice for voicing Uryu Ishida, rival of Ichigo in the series.As a note for parents, this is not a ""kids anime"" like Digimon, this has blood, violence, one of the minor characters (not any of the main characters) is apparently a lesbian, but it's not Tatsuki Arisawa or O?righime Inue. if you dislike that lifestyle (I do), but it doesn't really bother me that much, it's very minimal, as another note it does have some cursing and language, about as much as maybe a ""LOST"" episode, but that's about it.Unlike a lot of people, I like the English Dub, it's a lot easier to just watch the show than have to read all the dialogue using subtitles.  The language difference in grammatical structure doesn't bother me, even though some people say that some of the depth of the show is lost because of the language differences and how things are worded, I like it just the way it is.The downloads don't take too long, if you have fast Internet, then it should take a 4 to 5 hours to download the episodes, if you purchase the entire series, and then you can watch them as much as you want on your PC.  I really enjoy this show, and despite the higher price than the DVD, it's worth it for not having to wait for it to ship out.",5,"If you'd Rather Watch it on Your Computer than Wait for the DVD to Ship, Buy the Download!",1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,1863,"['Bleach', 'great', 'Anime', 'full', 'action/adventure', 'humor', 'story', 'Ichigo', 'Kurosaki', '15-year-old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'spirits', 'when', 'Rukia', 'Kouchki', 'thrust', 'world', 'monsters', 'called', 'Hollows', 'Soul', 'Reapers', 'who', 'fight', 'guide', 'souls', 'Soul', 'Society', 'afterlife', 'Anime.One', 'reasons', 'enjoy', 'show', 'excellent', 'voice', 'acting', 'Johnny', 'Von', 'Bach', 'great', 'voice', 'actor', 'who', 'conveys', 'real', 'emotion', 'only', 'script', 'voice', 'other', 'voice', 'actor', 'like', 'Derek', 'Stephen', 'Prince', 'who', 'voiced', 'Ken', 'Ichijouji', 'Digimon', 'Anime', 'excellent', 'choice', 'voicing', 'Uryu', 'Ishida', 'rival', 'Ichigo', 'series.As', 'note', 'parents', 'not', 'kids', 'anime', 'Digimon', 'blood', 'violence', 'one', 'minor', 'characters', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'apparently', 'lesbian', 'not', 'Tatsuki', 'Arisawa', 'O', 'righime', 'Inue', 'dislike', 'lifestyle', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'much', 'very', 'minimal', 'note', 'have', 'cursing', 'language', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'maybe', 'LOST', 'episode', 'it.Unlike', 'lot', 'people', 'like', 'English', 'Dub', 'lot', 'easier', 'just', 'watch', 'show', 'have', 'read', 'dialogue', 'using', 'subtitles', 'language', 'difference', 'grammatical', 'structure', ""n't"", 'bother', 'even', 'people', 'say', 'depth', 'show', 'lost', 'language', 'differences', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'worded', 'like', 'just', 'way', 'downloads', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'have', 'fast', 'Internet', 'then', 'should', 'take', '4', '5', 'hours', 'download', 'episodes', 'purchase', 'entire', 'series', 'then', 'can', 'watch', 'as', 'much', 'want', 'PC', 'really', 'enjoy', 'show', 'higher', 'price', 'DVD', 'not', 'having', 'wait', 'ship', 'out']",Bleach: The Substitute: Season 1 w/ Chain of Fate Wallet Chain

The first extra is ""Production Art,"" which is twenty seven pages of line art of the characters and items that appear in the episodes on the disc.  The second feature is ""Manga Preview,"" which is a preview of the first volume of the Bleach manga.  However, you have no control over the speed that the feature goes through the pages.  You also cannot rewind the feature, which is rather annoying if you can't read the text on the screen fast enough.  While this feature was an interesting idea, the execution could have been better.  The next feature is ""Clean Ending,"" which is a textless version of the first closing theme.  The final extra on the disc is ""Shonen Jump Home Video,"" which contains previews for Naruto, Hikaru no Go, and One Piece.The second disc has twenty three pages of production art of the characters and items that appear in the episodes on the disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" is simply ads for Bleach and other Viz Media manga titles.

I'm currently around episode 250 and over 100 of them are filler, honestly I'm starting to give up on the series, but the first 60 some episodes were so good I want to ride it out.like I said this is a review for the entire series, the first three sets get 5 stars, everything else gets 1 or 2 at the most.",5,"wonderful in every way, first 3 sets anyways",1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1312,"['review', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'bleach', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'amazon', 'however', 'are', 'same', 'product', 'first', '60', 'episodes', 'are', 'amazing', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'also', 'first', 'three', 'box', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'quality', 'three', 'are', 'creative', 'more', 'importantly', 'little', 'signs', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'such', 'hallow', 'mask', 'inside', 'box', 'other', 'little', 'easter', 'eggs', 'basically', 'could', 'tell', 'cared', 'quality', 'box', 'sets', 'spent', 'time', 'them.the', 'reason', ""'m"", 'limiting', 'first', 'three', 'sets', 'could', 'tell', 'stop', 'caring', 'third', 'set', 'instead', '20+', 'episodes', 'eventually', 'dwindle', 'down', '13', 'episodes', 'instead', 'releasing', 'entire', 'arc', 'season', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'divide', 'two', 'three', 'sets', 'quality', 'also', 'down', 'now', 'regular', 'DVD', 'case', 'little', 'creativity', 'also', 'number', 'filler', 'episodes', 'filler', 'arcs', 'non', 'cannon', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'more', 'then', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'currently', '250', '100', 'are', 'filler', 'honestly', ""'m"", 'starting', 'give', 'up', 'series', 'first', '60', 'episodes', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'want', 'ride', 'said', 'review', 'entire', 'series', 'first', 'three', 'sets', 'get', '5', 'stars', 'everything', 'else', '1', '2', 'most']",Bleach: The Substitute: Season 1 w/ Chain of Fate Wallet Chain

I researched both and came to a decision to look into Bleach due to the supernatural and samurai fantasy fiction I like, plus the plot and imagination is just astounding. Pretty much, my friends were right about Bleach.Seeing Im able to do only one review, Im going to include the other 2 seasons of Bleach as well. Warning: I am just giving you a one sentence summary for each season, so read ahead at your own risk.The first season is amazing and shows pretty much what the show is about.The second season shows Ichigo and his friends arriving in the spirit realm on the way to rescue Rukia from the Soul Society and fight the Soul Reaper captains along the way. And finally, season 3 draws down to who ordered the execution of Rukia, which will be a twist you will not believe; as well as the amazing fights that Ichigo will have as well some of the Soul Reaper Captains.The way I see it, each episode I watched, the show was getting better each disc. Bleach is one of those animes that gets better each time you watch a new episode, to be honest; it is very rare to find a good show that gets you interested these days. I bought it on trust and instinct, and both of those turned out to be good. I highly recommend this anime for anyone just starting out or beginning to discover anime.

1088116,AU8XR7NFMD6YT,B000T28G1E,R.B,"[113, 118]","For the uninitiated, Bleach is one of the newest shows in a long line of Shonen (for males) anime. The normal Shonen anime plot usually revolves around a boy (most often teenage) that has special abilities, and that uses them to overcome some sort of challenge. In the tradition of Yu Yu Hakusho and Dragonball (also Dragonball Z) this means that the show normally turns into a lengthy coming-of-age action anime in which the protagonist (hero) and antagonists (villains) constantly one up each other in a seemingly never ending cycle of power shifts that are interwoven between something resembling a plot. You can look forward to good action, comedy, and decently thought out characters, but you've also got to expect that the story might only serve as a vehicle for the flashy action sequences. This is where Bleach sets itself apart from other shonen anime such as Naruto and Dragonball Z; The plot is thick with political intrigue (thick for a shonen anime anyway) and with dark twists and turns that easily set it on a mantle as the premiere shonen anime (in the action category) of it's day.Someone above went over the synopsis of the story, so I'll leave that out. I will say that you can expect good characters, an interesting setting, great action, and passable (great at times) humor from the characters. This boxed set is referred to as season 1, and that seems to have upset one of the other reviewers, since it doesn't really feel like a ""season"" at all. This is because most shonen anime aren't separated into seasons in the American sense. Shonen anime (by design) run hundreds of episodes, with story arcs that can range anywhere from 60 to 100 episodes. Bleach's first story arc is 60ish episodes, so really you could call this boxed set ""Arc 1 part 1 of 3"" though I'm sure ""Season 1"" sounds a whole lot better.In the box, you get 20 episodes on 5 discs, with extras such as production art (on the DVD's) and textless versions of the endings. Both Japanese and English audio are on the discs, with English subtitles. Inside the box is a book-style DVD case with 1 DVD per side (nice compared to the two discs on top of each other in boxed sets such as the DBZ season sets) and the original case art from the single DVD releases inset. Rounding it out is a poster of Rukia and Ichigo, as well as images of Kon and a hollow mask printed inside the outer box (a very nice touch indeed. I was surprised to see Kon looking up at me from the box). Overall, this is probably the highest quality (value) boxed set I've ever bought. When I say value, I mean a boxed set that is just the DVD's, and not a ""Limited Edition"" set (which usually come with full length posters, stickers, pencils, OST's etc). The addition of the poster in the box was more than I was expecting for a set as low priced as this, and truthfully, most boxed sets you buy don't even have little extras like that.In conclusion, if you go into a shonen anime seeking something as deep and dark as an anime such as Monster or Elfen Lied, then you probably need to rethink the genre you are going into. I would argue however that by the time you've seen the end of the 60 episode first arc of Bleach, you would agree that the story in a shonen anime can absolutely transcend the genre, and become something that coexists with the action, instead of being something that exists only as a distraction between excellent fights (of which there are many in Bleach). Bleach destroys it's peers in the shonen genre (such as Naruto, and One Piece), and I'd say it's definitely worth the buy if you liked such shows as Yu Yu Hakusho or Dragonball Z.",5,Cream of the shonen anime crop,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,3617,"['uninitiated', 'Bleach', 'one', 'newest', 'shows', 'long', 'line', 'Shonen', 'males', 'anime', 'normal', 'Shonen', 'anime', 'plot', 'usually', 'around', 'boy', 'most', 'often', 'teenage', 'special', 'abilities', 'overcome', 'sort', 'challenge', 'tradition', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'Dragonball', 'also', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'show', 'normally', 'lengthy', 'coming-of-age', 'action', 'anime', 'protagonist', 'hero', 'antagonists', 'villains', 'constantly', 'one', 'other', 'seemingly', 'never', 'ending', 'cycle', 'power', 'shifts', 'are', 'interwoven', 'something', 'resembling', 'plot', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'good', 'action', 'comedy', 'decently', 'thought', 'out', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'also', 'got', 'expect', 'story', 'might', 'only', 'serve', 'vehicle', 'flashy', 'action', 'sequences', 'where', 'Bleach', 'apart', 'other', 'shonen', 'anime', 'such', 'Naruto', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'plot', 'thick', 'political', 'intrigue', 'thick', 'shonen', 'anime', 'anyway', 'dark', 'twists', 'easily', 'set', 'mantle', 'premiere', 'shonen', 'anime', 'action', 'category', 'day.Someone', 'went', 'synopsis', 'story', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'will', 'say', 'can', 'expect', 'good', 'characters', 'interesting', 'setting', 'great', 'action', 'passable', 'great', 'times', 'humor', 'characters', 'boxed', 'set', 'referred', 'season', '1', 'have', 'upset', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'season', 'most', 'shonen', 'anime', 'are', ""n't"", 'separated', 'seasons', 'American', 'sense', 'Shonen', 'anime', 'design', 'run', 'hundreds', 'episodes', 'story', 'arcs', 'can', 'range', 'anywhere', '60', '100', 'episodes', 'Bleach', 'first', 'story', 'arc', '60ish', 'episodes', 'so', 'really', 'could', 'call', 'boxed', 'set', 'Arc', '1', 'part', '1', '3', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Season', '1', 'whole', 'lot', 'box', 'get', '20', 'episodes', '5', 'discs', 'extras', 'such', 'production', 'art', 'DVD', 'textless', 'versions', 'endings', 'Japanese', 'English', 'audio', 'are', 'discs', 'English', 'subtitles', 'box', 'book-style', 'DVD', 'case', '1', 'DVD', 'side', 'nice', 'compared', 'two', 'discs', 'top', 'other', 'boxed', 'sets', 'such', 'DBZ', 'season', 'sets', 'original', 'case', 'art', 'single', 'DVD', 'inset', 'Rounding', 'out', 'poster', 'Rukia', 'Ichigo', 'as', 'well', 'images', 'Kon', 'hollow', 'mask', 'printed', 'outer', 'box', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'indeed', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Kon', 'looking', 'up', 'box', 'Overall', 'probably', 'highest', 'quality', 'value', 'boxed', 'set', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'bought', 'When', 'say', 'value', 'mean', 'boxed', 'set', 'just', 'DVD', 'not', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'set', 'usually', 'come', 'full', 'length', 'posters', 'stickers', 'pencils', 'OST', 'etc', 'addition', 'poster', 'box', 'was', 'more', 'was', 'expecting', 'set', 'low', 'priced', 'truthfully', 'most', 'boxed', 'sets', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'little', 'extras', 'that.In', 'conclusion', 'go', 'shonen', 'anime', 'seeking', 'something', 'deep', 'dark', 'anime', 'such', 'Monster', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'then', 'probably', 'need', 'rethink', 'genre', 'are', 'going', 'would', 'argue', 'however', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'end', '60', 'episode', 'first', 'arc', 'Bleach', 'would', 'agree', 'story', 'shonen', 'anime', 'can', 'absolutely', 'transcend', 'genre', 'become', 'something', 'action', 'instead', 'being', 'something', 'only', 'distraction', 'excellent', 'fights', 'are', 'many', 'Bleach', 'Bleach', 'peers', 'shonen', 'genre', 'such', 'Naruto', 'One', 'Piece', ""'d"", 'say', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buy', 'liked', 'such', 'shows', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'Dragonball', 'Z']",Bleach: The Substitute: Season 1 w/ Chain of Fate Wallet Chain

The storyline is pretty simple like most reviewers say with a dash of power plays and betrayal story lines in the series as well.  I would say this is a newer version of Yu YU Hakusho with a mix of Samurai X but done exceptionally well.  The English and Japanese voice actors are great and the animation is done very well the humor in the series is done very good too.  I decided I wanted to get this one instead of the standard one being released in June because with this set you get both the English and Japanese audio with the standard version you just the English audio only I heard.  The season set only goes up to episode 20 so sadly we're going to have to either wait for the season 2 box set or get the dvd's one by one as usual.

The list includesHikaru No Go,Hajime no IppoandYu Yu Hakusho, but if you are looking for the best shonen anime for adults (and I am aware of the oxymoron) then i would have to say ""Bleach"" takes the price.Even though the series has elements that portray why this is classified as a series for teenage boys, there are also many layers to the story that make it look as if it was targeted to a different demographic. The storyline is dark and captivating, and the topics of loss, friendship, sacrifice and fighting against insurmountable odds are explored vastly.One of the aspects that really surprised me was how quickly I was hooked by this series. In my experience it takes me somewhere from 4 to 6 episodes to get to the point at which I feel I ""need"" to keep watching a series non-stop. Even some of my favorite anime likeBerserkorBlack Lagoonrequired me to watch at least four episodes to be captivated. This was not the case with ""Bleach"", since when the first episode ended I felt I was not going to be able to stop for a while.Finally, this series did not fall for the pitfall some other series in the genre fall for, and that is to keep a story arc going for way too many episodes.

1088123,A5WYNVGEOGV4T,B000T28G1E,SirTheory,"[9, 12]","I was pretty cynical about the whole Bleach thing. It is Shonen Jump, and Shonen Jump doesn't really have a good reputation among hardcore anime fans. However, I watched through the most recent episode via fansubs and realized I liked it enough to acquire the DVDs.First of all, the current price ($28) is hard to beat. You get the first 20 episodes, which unfortunately aren't the best (things really pick up in the next few boxsets)... but do serve as an important introduction to the series. As far as the actual boxset goes, this one is really nice. Unlike the crappy Naruto Uncut boxes (I mean, I love Naruto and get those box sets, but you don't look at those and say, wowie, what a well-designed box!), the Bleach box has fantastic little touches that fans appreciate and enjoy. (Plus, it includes a poster... which is much more useful than those pointless books that come packaged with Naruto).Bleach is highly overrated simply due to its popularity. But that doesn't mean it is a bad series. Sure, I wish shows like Elfin Lied or Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi got the same kind of attention, but I've never been one to throw out the baby with the bathwater.(I will say I find Viz's use of ""soul reaper"" instead of the fansubber's use of ""shinigami"" quite obnoxious.

1088125,A16I1TNBSOLQFG,B000T28G1E,Tristan A. Hayes,"[4, 4]","Bleach is an action packed anime that began in 2004 in Japan/2006 in the US.  At the time of this writing, the English language dubbed versions have been announced to extend to 172 episodes (or 9 seasons), while the Japanese version has 227 episodes (11 seasons) with no intention of stopping anytime soon.  For people who like lengthy anime this is definitely one of the ones to choose but because of the lack of reruns ever appearing on TV networks now is a good time to start.I personally started watching Bleach after buying a copy of the monthly Shonen Jump that is released here and seeing nice action sequences in Bleach.  I tended to avoid any of the hype associated with shows because often times hype has lead me to be bored out of my mind.  On that note, Season 1 of Bleach (The Substitute) starts off on a confusing high, goes to a slight droll, and then regains its high at  the final 5 episodes of the season.The first episodes open with Ichigo, the main protagonist, being able to see Souls.  He meets another girl who is able to see Souls, Rukia, who comes from the Soul Society, which is explained in later episodes to be this gateway world that maintains a balance between the destinations of the souls (yeah its kind of confusing, but the second season takes place in the ""Soul Society"" so we will hopefully get a clearer explanation then).  She transfers her powers to Ichigo, making him a Soul Reaper, empowering him with the powers to fight misguided souls, ie, evil souls known as hollows. The rest of the 20 episodes explore his role as a Soul Reaper as well as a student/friend.  Several episodes have interesting plots as well as interesting commentary on death and such.  The main background plotline in these episodes should be evident to most people.  The final episode is a cliffhanger, however, the ""episode previews"" at the end of the credits ruins the ""cliffhanger"".The series is written as Original and Uncut, this means that the episodes have the original Japanese opening.  All of the 20 episodes in this volume use the original Japanese opening for Bleach, with the song, ""Asterisk"" by Orange Range (they seem to have done an ending theme in Naruto); the opening song will grow on most people after 20 episodes, even if it sounds weird at first. The two ending themes are also Japanese, the first is ""Life is Like a Boat"" by ""Rie Fu"" which has some English lyrics, and ""Thank You"" by ""Home Made Kazoku.""  The endings are more enjoyable.  At the end of each ending is an episode preview with hilarious commentary done by a revolving cast of characters.The voice actors are all amazing and a few of them have voiced roles in other anime. For example the Johnny Yong Bosch who voices Ichigo sounds exactly like the voice of Lelouch Lamperouge/Zero in Code Geass (basically if you saw that anime, then his voice has not changed one bit). The Derek Stephen Prince who voices Uryu in Bleach sounds exactly like Ken from Digimo, and Shino from Naruto.  The voice of one of the Hollows in Bleach sounds exactly like Pakkun from Naruto.  So the English cast did well for this show.  OF course since this is an ORIGINAL and UNCUT boxset full Japanese vocals are included with English subtitles, so purists should be proud.The show has solid animation that doesn't fall apart in high action sequences.  The solid colors works in making this look like a modern anime as well.  Blood is also appropriately shown in this ORIGINAL and UNCUT version.Finally in terms of the product, a poster of Ichigo is included in which he is wielding his zanpakuto ""Zangetsu"".  Each of the 5 disc's has its own graphic on it.  The DVD boxset has an outbox that surrounds a case of the 5 discs.  It is reasonably sturdy and nice looking.Bonus features of the discs includes previews of various Shonen Jump anime such as Naruto, as well as other VIZ media properties.  There is also an extensive section on the behind the scenes with the English language cast, and lastly ""clean"" (creditless) versions of the ending themes.Ultimately this is a pretty solid boxset for the anime and is an appropriate start for the series.  It is suggested that anyone who likes previous Shonen Jump anime, or even just Shonen anime in particular pick up this boxset and start collecting them for Bleach.",5,Great Anime: Its Not Too Late To Start,1245110400,"06 16, 2009",2009,4292,"['Bleach', 'action', 'packed', 'anime', 'began', '2004', 'Japan/2006', 'US', 'time', 'writing', 'English', 'language', 'dubbed', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'announced', 'extend', '172', 'episodes', '9', 'seasons', 'Japanese', 'version', '227', 'episodes', '11', 'seasons', 'intention', 'stopping', 'anytime', 'soon', 'people', 'who', 'lengthy', 'anime', 'definitely', 'one', 'ones', 'choose', 'lack', 'reruns', 'ever', 'appearing', 'TV', 'networks', 'now', 'good', 'time', 'start.I', 'personally', 'started', 'watching', 'Bleach', 'buying', 'copy', 'monthly', 'Shonen', 'Jump', 'released', 'here', 'seeing', 'nice', 'action', 'sequences', 'Bleach', 'tended', 'avoid', 'hype', 'associated', 'shows', 'because', 'often', 'hype', 'lead', 'be', 'bored', 'mind', 'note', 'Season', '1', 'Bleach', 'Substitute', 'off', 'confusing', 'high', 'slight', 'droll', 'then', 'high', 'final', '5', 'episodes', 'season.The', 'first', 'open', 'Ichigo', 'main', 'protagonist', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'Souls', 'girl', 'who', 'able', 'see', 'Souls', 'Rukia', 'who', 'Soul', 'Society', 'explained', 'later', 'episodes', 'be', 'gateway', 'world', 'balance', 'destinations', 'souls', 'yeah', 'kind', 'confusing', 'second', 'season', 'place', 'Soul', 'Society', 'will', 'hopefully', 'get', 'clearer', 'explanation', 'then', 'powers', 'Ichigo', 'making', 'Soul', 'Reaper', 'empowering', 'powers', 'fight', 'misguided', 'souls', 'ie', 'evil', 'souls', 'known', 'hollows', 'rest', '20', 'episodes', 'role', 'Soul', 'Reaper', 'as', 'well', 'student/friend', 'Several', 'episodes', 'have', 'interesting', 'plots', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'death', 'such', 'main', 'background', 'plotline', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'evident', 'most', 'people', 'final', 'episode', 'cliffhanger', 'however', 'episode', 'previews', 'end', 'credits', 'cliffhanger', '.The', 'series', 'written', 'Original', 'Uncut', 'episodes', 'have', 'original', 'Japanese', 'opening', '20', 'episodes', 'volume', 'original', 'Japanese', 'opening', 'Bleach', 'song', 'Asterisk', 'Orange', 'Range', 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'ending', 'theme', 'Naruto', 'opening', 'song', 'will', 'grow', 'most', 'people', '20', 'episodes', 'even', 'weird', 'first', 'two', 'ending', 'themes', 'are', 'also', 'Japanese', 'first', 'Life', 'Boat', 'Rie', 'Fu', 'English', 'lyrics', 'Thank', 'Home', 'Made', 'Kazoku', 'endings', 'are', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'end', 'ending', 'episode', 'preview', 'hilarious', 'commentary', 'done', 'revolving', 'cast', 'characters.The', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'amazing', 'few', 'have', 'voiced', 'roles', 'other', 'anime', 'example', 'Johnny', 'Yong', 'Bosch', 'who', 'Ichigo', 'exactly', 'voice', 'Lelouch', 'Lamperouge/Zero', 'Code', 'Geass', 'basically', 'saw', 'anime', 'then', 'voice', 'not', 'changed', 'one', 'bit', 'Derek', 'Stephen', 'Prince', 'who', 'Uryu', 'Bleach', 'exactly', 'Ken', 'Digimo', 'Shino', 'Naruto', 'voice', 'one', 'Hollows', 'Bleach', 'exactly', 'like', 'Pakkun', 'Naruto', 'English', 'cast', 'did', 'well', 'show', 'course', 'ORIGINAL', 'UNCUT', 'boxset', 'full', 'Japanese', 'vocals', 'are', 'included', 'English', 'subtitles', 'purists', 'should', 'be', 'proud.The', 'show', 'solid', 'animation', ""n't"", 'fall', 'apart', 'high', 'action', 'sequences', 'solid', 'colors', 'making', 'look', 'modern', 'anime', 'as', 'well', 'Blood', 'also', 'appropriately', 'shown', 'ORIGINAL', 'UNCUT', 'version.Finally', 'terms', 'product', 'poster', 'Ichigo', 'included', 'wielding', 'zanpakuto', 'Zangetsu', '5', 'disc', 'own', 'graphic', 'DVD', 'boxset', 'outbox', 'case', '5', 'discs', 'reasonably', 'sturdy', 'nice', 'looking.Bonus', 'features', 'discs', 'previews', 'various', 'Shonen', 'Jump', 'anime', 'such', 'Naruto', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'VIZ', 'media', 'properties', 'also', 'extensive', 'section', 'scenes', 'English', 'language', 'cast', 'lastly', 'clean', 'creditless', 'versions', 'ending', 'themes.Ultimately', 'pretty', 'solid', 'boxset', 'anime', 'appropriate', 'start', 'series', 'suggested', 'anyone', 'who', 'previous', 'Shonen', 'Jump', 'anime', 'even', 'just', 'Shonen', 'anime', 'particular', 'pick', 'up', 'boxset', 'start', 'collecting', 'Bleach']",Bleach: The Substitute: Season 1 w/ Chain of Fate Wallet Chain
1088126,A1JEHPPJ4475HP,B000T28G1E,W. Watson,"[0, 0]","I got started watching this Anime by my nephew. He mentioned it, and I sought out the episodes on Joost, Hulu and Youtube. I have to say that I was really impressed by the production. This is an anime the exemplifies what an Anime should be. After just a few episodes, I went out and bought Season One. Now I am a parent of a 9 year old child, so what I have to say is with that in mind. She doesn't really watch this with me, but she knows that it's ""Daddy's Cartoon."" She watches it with me from time to time but right now she's more interested in Shojo type anime. Bleach is violent, that is one of the things I should say up front. But unlike others, I don't fear my child seeing violence on a Cartoon. The makers of this Anime aren't trying to manage your children, they're trying to tell a story--a fact that animators in the US would do well to realize. That's one of this anime's strengths--it doesn't try to reshape the world. There are good guys and there are bad guys and right is right and wrong is wrong. That's the way a hero's story should be.Ichigo is a complex character, as are all of the characters in this saga. Even with their complexities, it is easy to follow and I like that. Chad, Uryu, Rukia, Orihime and Kon all develop as characters during the course of this story. No one is cardboard or seems to be window dressing to the story. The way Ichigo interacts with each of them further establishes his image as the hero. I particularly enjoy the relationship between Ichigo and Rukia who come to mean a lot to each other as friends and perhaps even more...While Ichigo gains strength as a Soul Reaper, he is not invincible. He makes a lot of mistakes and he suffers for them. In spite of this, he overcomes his setbacks and pushes forward. He doesn't think about the possibility that he might loose. He's protective of his friends and willing to sacrifice in order to protect the people who need protecting. This has rapidly become my favorite Anime and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime.",5,One of the very best...,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,2026,"['got', 'started', 'watching', 'Anime', 'nephew', 'mentioned', 'sought', 'out', 'episodes', 'Joost', 'Hulu', 'Youtube', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'production', 'anime', 'exemplifies', 'what', 'Anime', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'few', 'episodes', 'went', 'out', 'bought', 'Season', 'One', 'Now', 'am', 'parent', '9', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'mind', ""n't"", 'really', 'watch', 'Daddy', 'Cartoon', 'time', 'time', 'right', 'now', 'more', 'interested', 'Shojo', 'type', 'anime', 'Bleach', 'violent', 'one', 'things', 'should', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'fear', 'child', 'seeing', 'violence', 'Cartoon', 'makers', 'Anime', 'are', ""n't"", 'trying', 'manage', 'children', ""'re"", 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'fact', 'animators', 'US', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'realize', 'one', 'anime', 'strengths', ""n't"", 'try', 'reshape', 'world', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'right', 'right', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'way', 'hero', 'story', 'should', 'be.Ichigo', 'complex', 'character', 'are', 'characters', 'saga', 'Even', 'complexities', 'easy', 'follow', 'like', 'Chad', 'Uryu', 'Rukia', 'Orihime', 'Kon', 'all', 'develop', 'characters', 'course', 'story', 'one', 'cardboard', 'be', 'window', 'dressing', 'story', 'way', 'Ichigo', 'further', 'image', 'hero', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'relationship', 'Ichigo', 'Rukia', 'who', 'come', 'mean', 'lot', 'other', 'friends', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'Ichigo', 'gains', 'strength', 'Soul', 'Reaper', 'not', 'invincible', 'lot', 'mistakes', 'spite', 'setbacks', 'pushes', 'forward', ""n't"", 'think', 'possibility', 'might', 'loose', 'protective', 'friends', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'protect', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'protecting', 'rapidly', 'become', 'favorite', 'Anime', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'anime']",Bleach: The Substitute: Season 1 w/ Chain of Fate Wallet Chain
