966719,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000E2D448,Byron Kolln,"[16, 16]","SUSAN SLEPT HERE finally makes it's DVD debut as part of the Warner Archive program.  In one of her rare loan-outs to RKO, Debbie Reynolds is Susan Landis, a seventeen-year-old petty criminal who is taken in by Hollywood screenwriter Mark Christopher (Dick Powell in his final movie role before heading off to TV-land) on Christmas Eve.  What starts out as simply a kind gesture to keep Susan out of juvenile detention over the holidays soon dissolves into a marriage-of-convenience, when Mark decides to help Susan avoid her jail sentence completely.  After their Vegas nuptials, Mark keeps his distance by moving to a Big Bear cabin in order to work on his latest script, but no-one counts on Susan, and her plan to remain Mrs Christopher...Debbie is her adorable best, and Dick Powell treads carefully in a difficult role.  The supporting cast is sublime, with delicious Anne Francis as Mark's ""permanent girlfriend"", film diva Isabella Alexander.  Glenda Farrell is Maude Snodgrass, Mark's wisecracking, gin-swilling secretary who later becomes Susan's greatest ally; and Alvy Moore is hilarious playing Mark's former naval superior and now-personal assistant, Virgil.The film has a really fun dream sequence that is pure Frank Tashlin, a witty screenplay and great performances from Reynolds and Powell, not to mention the Academy Award-nominated song ""Hold My Hand"".  And what other movie is narrated by an Oscar statuette?!  The print on this DVD-R from the Warner Archive is basic but watchable, with nicely saturated colour.  There is a noticeable amount of debris and dirt in the print, but it's on par with the copy that's regularly aired on TCM.  There are no extras apart from the trailer, and as with the other discs from the Warner Archive, it might not be playable on PC drives or DVD recorder devices.  Recommended for Debbie fans; they've wanted this movie on DVD for a long time.",4,"""You know, I've forgotten what seventeen-year-old emotional kids are like.

966723,A2M7AT2MLL25EW,B000E2D448,D. Stoker,"[3, 6]","Yes, the fifties were different.  I know- I am a product of those times.  Women tended to marry earlier and start families as soon as they were through with formalities... (some got off to a head start).  Debbie Reynolds plays a charming, precocious and very mature looking 17 year old who is in love with a 35 year old man- (Dick Powell was really 50 at the time of this filming, Debbie was actually 22).  Now, all that being said, I don't see anything wrong with the older man paradigm (nor the older woman one either) but we are dealing with glorifying this type of relationship with a minor here- and as cute and lush as the movie is, that message is not cute at all when it's played out in real life.  Without the farce marriage depicted in the movie, um- it's quite illegal.Now, if you would have made Susan 14 to 16 in the movie... people would have started to think it was quite sick for this guy to ""come to his senses"" about his romantic love for the girl- and that wouldn't have flown over well.  But, if you make her seventeen... well, that's another story right.  She's ALMOST legal.This movie is a vicarious pleasure for all teenyboppers with crushes on older men- and yes, a lot of us remember crushes like that.  It's also a vicarious pleasure for guys who like to see society pass on their playing around the edges.  Take out the forbidden fruit factor of Susan being seventeen, and the movie wouldn't have any driving force.All that said, I can't help but love Debbie Reynolds in anything.

966725,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,B000E2D448,Great Movie Addict,"[7, 7]","No, I'd never maintain that this sometimes-forgotten 1954 classic has a plot you could easily swallow, but...who cares? The pairing of Powell and Reynolds was a stroke of genius for RKO and director Frank Tashlin (who directed many of those awful Jerry Lewis movies). Things are a bit dated here and there, and the Broadway sitcom cliches of its era often run rampant. But it's still great fun, thanks to a highly accomplished cast and many wryly funny moments. The comedic pacing and dry wit, not to mention plenty of satire about Hollywood itself, will remind you of many well-paced 30's films. But the best parts of this movie are Debbie (before she got trapped and wasted in those Tammy roles), Dick Powell, who does a slendid job in his last starring role, and a game supporting cast that seems incapable of making mistakes with this predictable but enjoyable script. If you aren't accustomed to some of the conventions of 50's movies, you'll undoubtedly howl when Powell confesses to a shocked young Debbie that he's really ""middle-aged"" (at age 35, no less, though Powell was actually older). A few dated lines notwithstanding, this has always been one of the most enjoyable and polished roles I ever saw from Reynolds or Powell. Don't miss the scene where Powell, a has-been film writer, is watching a late-night movie on tv and glumly lip-synching the torrid lines of a sappy dialogue his character once wrote for a really bad film. Even for the Fifties, there's a certain chic about the way this little romp was put together and performed -- a blessed relief from the often nauseating, in-your-face dumbness of many modern films.",4,"50's Cliches, But In A Very Nice Package",1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,1639,"[""'d"", 'never', 'maintain', 'sometimes-forgotten', '1954', 'classic', 'plot', 'could', 'easily', 'swallow', 'who', 'pairing', 'Powell', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'RKO', 'director', 'Frank', 'Tashlin', 'who', 'directed', 'many', 'awful', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'movies', 'Things', 'are', 'bit', 'dated', 'here', 'there', 'Broadway', 'sitcom', 'cliches', 'era', 'often', 'run', 'rampant', 'still', 'great', 'fun', 'thanks', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'cast', 'many', 'wryly', 'funny', 'moments', 'comedic', 'pacing', 'dry', 'wit', 'not', 'mention', 'plenty', 'satire', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'remind', 'many', 'well-paced', '30', 'films', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'Debbie', 'got', 'trapped', 'wasted', 'Tammy', 'roles', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'who', 'slendid', 'job', 'last', 'starring', 'role', 'game', 'supporting', 'cast', 'incapable', 'making', 'mistakes', 'predictable', 'enjoyable', 'script', 'are', ""n't"", 'accustomed', 'conventions', '50', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'undoubtedly', 'howl', 'when', 'Powell', 'shocked', 'young', 'Debbie', 'really', 'middle-aged', 'age', '35', 'less', 'though', 'Powell', 'was', 'actually', 'older', 'few', 'dated', 'lines', 'notwithstanding', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'polished', 'roles', 'ever', 'saw', 'Reynolds', 'Powell', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'scene', 'where', 'Powell', 'has-been', 'film', 'writer', 'watching', 'late-night', 'movie', 'tv', 'glumly', 'lip-synching', 'torrid', 'lines', 'sappy', 'dialogue', 'character', 'once', 'wrote', 'really', 'bad', 'film', 'Even', 'Fifties', 'certain', 'chic', 'way', 'little', 'romp', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'performed', 'blessed', 'relief', 'often', 'nauseating', 'in-your-face', 'dumbness', 'many', 'modern', 'films']",N/A

A twenty-two year old Debbie Reynolds captured in this film was certainly in one of those rare moments.Tells the story of Mark Christopher, formerly of the US Navy, now the happy recipient of wealth and fame as the go-to-guy for Hollywood comedic writing. Having recently won an Oscar for Best Screenplay, he's determined to move beyond the yucks into more serious endeavors. Despite the highly compensated work the studios are offering - he wants to become an ""artist"". So he quits, deciding to take time off to find his dramatic voice.Assisting him in his quest are his personal assistant Virgil; who, in a strange twist of roles, was his former commanding officer while in the service. And Maude - stenographer, typist, and general purpose snark generator.The past fifteen years have settled into a comfortable life of luxurious routine for the trio. Mark is dating someone well past his humble caste, poised to rise up the social ladder in the form of a cold beauty named Isabella, daughter to a US Senator. Good ol' Virgil makes his wingman moves on the leftovers. No complaints, since Mark's leftovers are wannabe starlets. Hardly scraping the barrel. And Maude enjoys a decent living working short flexible hours and having a funny flexible boss.All is well in the Christopher household.Until one dark rainy night just before Christmas.A knock at the door and a police officer that Mark had befriended earlier as a movie advisor is eager to see him. Said cop has brought with him a very special present.Enter scruffy Susan Landis - 17 and 1/2 years old.Wild and rambunctious, she's currently a juvenile delinquent. But only for a few short months more. After that, she'll be 18 and legally a resident of the adult courts and the big house. The cops feel that given the holiday, their waiting families, and the accompanying mountain of paperwork they are desperate to avoid - would Mark help them out by keeping a watch over her during the holiday? Just until they can have their time off without complications. After that, they'll pick her back up and she'll be out of his hair. Besides, this gives the writer a chance to really learn about the world of juvenile delinquency for his new serious movie script - and isn't that a wonderful gift?However, what they failed to notice are two salient facts. First, under that grubby loutish heehaw exterior is a very beautiful girl. And secondly, at 18 years of age, Susan will also legally be a woman.Two points that will completely upend the stable life of Mark Christopher & Company.Reynolds was really something to behold in this film. The scene where she uncovers her holiday warden's personal films and begins to replay them as mocking caricatures - hilarious! Debbie is literally bursting with effervescent energy. A truly vibrant and thoroughly enjoyable performance.Over the years I've enjoyed Ms. Reynolds in several movies and she's always delivered.  e.g. How Sweet It Is, Goodbye Charlie, In And Out, etc. But this was the first time I've screened her when she was a fresh-faced newcomer. Her youthful energy, that incredible exuberance...well, to say it was a shock would be understatement defined. I was floored. Rarely experienced such raw sensuality contained in the smallest of cute packages.Personal Notes:- Could've done without the song-n-dance dream sequence, which I found routine and pointless. But it was the 50s and this was Dick Powell. So... &lt;shrug>- I honestly did not plan on screening two films of married couple Dick Powell and June Allyson one after another. (didn't even know they were married at all until researching this movie) And to then note both productions centered around the theme of the May-December romance --- talk about a patently bizarre coincidence.Notably, the two films could not have been more divergent in their results.A seemingly perfect symmetry of pain and pleasure. One that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear there was an unseen hand guiding this cinematic moment.Now, I often think to that other film - the disastrous and horrific remake of 'My Man Godfrey [VHS]' with Allyson - and wonder what we would saying today had Debbie Reynolds been chosen as young Irene Bullock.

If you remember Debbie Reynolds, you know its going to be fun watching her opposite Dick Powell.This movie is from the fifties when the industry displayed more originality, hired good writers, and used original plots.  That is, before movies became expensive sequels about comic book characters, with lots of special effects, targeting generally unsophisticated audiences.Anyone remember how much better movies were before the writers strike?  The problem is not that writers wanted to be paid more, but the cheapskates who employ them. That same parsimonious attitude is exhibited in the movies being released today, with a few exceptions.Watch an old movie of the 30's through the 50's.  You'll like it.

966731,A37S3ACL57LN62,B000E2D448,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[10, 10]","Susan Slept Here is a great comedy from the golden age of Hollywood. It involves an aged Oscar-winning writer (Dick Powell) whose main goal in life is to duplicate his past success. In passing, he mentions to some cop friends that he'd like to talk to some of the young delinquints they come into contact with to try to get story ideas. On Christmas Eve, the cops bring him just that, a seventeen year old girl (Debbie Reynolds). The writer is more put off by her presence, especially when she continually meddles with his relationship with a glamourous woman. In the end though, he agrees to marry the girl to keep her out of jail. He foresees the marriage ending in an annulment, but she has other ideas.It is nice to see Dick Powell in a film so late in his career, but he has changed a lot from the baby-faced crooner of the early 30s. His face shows his age which helps some of the comedy, including the line where he admits he is 36 years old. Even without that singing voice and lovable smile, he's great.Debbie Reynolds is surprisingly good as well. She shows a knack for comedy and a charm that few young actresses possess.",4,Sweet Golden Comedy,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,1132,"['Susan', 'Slept', 'Here', 'great', 'comedy', 'golden', 'age', 'Hollywood', 'aged', 'Oscar-winning', 'writer', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'main', 'goal', 'life', 'duplicate', 'past', 'success', 'passing', 'cop', 'friends', ""'d"", 'like', 'talk', 'young', 'delinquints', 'come', 'contact', 'try', 'get', 'story', 'ideas', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'cops', 'bring', 'just', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'writer', 'more', 'put', 'off', 'presence', 'especially', 'when', 'continually', 'relationship', 'glamourous', 'woman', 'end', 'marry', 'girl', 'keep', 'jail', 'marriage', 'ending', 'annulment', 'other', 'ideas.It', 'nice', 'see', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'film', 'so', 'late', 'career', 'changed', 'lot', 'baby-faced', 'crooner', 'early', '30s', 'face', 'age', 'comedy', 'including', 'line', 'where', '36', 'years', 'old', 'Even', 'singing', 'voice', 'lovable', 'smile', 'great.Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'knack', 'comedy', 'charm', 'few', 'young', 'actresses', 'possess']",N/A
