861205,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B00065GX96,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 1]","I thoroughly enjoy a BBC production, and the Barchester Chronicles, based on works by Trollope,The Wardenand Barchester Towers (Volume 1), is a perfect one.  It's fantastic cast, incredible costumes--BBC should have a museum dedicated to what can only be described as costume art, maybe even send them on tours of foreign museums; I'd certainly pay to see them!--and stunning scenery are a visual feast.Like so much of British TV these stories are filled with characters that literally come alive and capture the viewer with the subtleties of their lives.  Each is a work of art.  Donald Pleasence, is the central figure in both parts of the feature, and his Rev. Harding is perfection.  It reminds me of his role of Oracle Jones in theThe Hallelujah Trail, which I also found delightful.  Probably the most noticeable character for younger audiences will be that of Alan Rickman, the erstwhile Professor Snape of Harry Potter fame,Harry Potter Years 1-6 Giftset (Widescreen Edition), and a character with something in common with the Chaplin Slope whom he portrays here in Barchester Chronicles.  Slope's almost serpentine approach to the females in his company is creepier than Snape ever thought of being; the way he uses his nose, eyes, and the position and motion of his head leaves one with the impression of a cobra about to swallow a mouse whole.  Wonderful work.The general intention of the work is of light social criticism with a happy ending.  I'm not quite sure how to take it though.  If the author is against the status quo of society and of the Anglican Church in particular, why does nothing change?  If he is against the efforts of radicals to change the customs that the social elite hold near and dear and on which their leisure and comfortable living depend, why does he point out so clearly the evils of the time?  One must assume that his intention is simply to gently raise the audience's consciousness of the problems of society and of its own complicity in perpetuating them without making them angry or defensive.  In this he might be seen as partaking more of Shaw's,George Bernard Shaw's Plays (Norton Critical Editions), method of invoking laughter over society's foibles rather than of Henrik Ibsen's tendency to weap over abuses,Four Major Plays: (Doll's House; Ghosts; Hedda Gabler; and The Master Builder) (Oxford World's Classics).I couldn't help but feel that the poor Slope (formerly ""Slop but he added an e"") was much put upon and that the audience unwittingly takes a willing part in his undoing by hoping for it in the end.  Admitting that he is an odious person, he is also something of a self-made man.  His only ""crime"" is to have risen above his station, that of a ""guttersnipe"" according to the imperious Mrs. Proudy.  Even worse is the obviousness of his every intent.  While politer society had learned at its mother's knee to disguise every intention, poor Snape's demeanor gives everything away.  He is funny only because he is so obvious and therefore easily made the fool. In this respect his character reminds me of Malvolio inTwelfth Night, whose pretences are much the same and whose punishment for them is also to be revealed a fool.Nor has Chaplin Slope done anything more to promote himself than has already been done by those far higher up the food chain than he.  He aspires to a rich wife, places professional advancement before love, pulls strings to gain allies, equivocates to cover duplicity, places his own designs before the well being of others with greater need, and betrays the interests of a former mentor to gain advantage.  In short, he behaves like his ""betters.""  Having had his efforts to enter into polite society foiled by those around him, and just as in Shakespeare, the Fool Slope has something significant to say. His parting shot to the weak willed Bishop and his spiteful and manipulative wife--and probably to the audience and society as well--is ""may you live forever.""  Something like the Chinese curse ""may you live in interesting times!""  One is left to wonder if he is not the only person in the play with anything like a clear understanding of the situation and what if anything he will do with his new found knowledge.  From lesser beginnings great and passionate social reformers arise!Audiences ""should"" identify with Slope; not many of us today are high society and even fewer of us were so at the time the book was written.  Yet because the Chaplin is socially pilloried by the situation, we tend to side with those conspiring against him and are happy at his defeat and content with our ""happy ending.""  Once again, if the author's intention is simply to raise the audience's consciousness of the problems of society and of its own complicity in perpetuating them, one has to admire his subtly but wonder if it had any effect other than to entertain.  Still the work has much to say to a modern audience about society and its victims.

861206,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00065GX96,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I read some of the Barchester series a great many years ago, and one of them recently, and the rest are sitting on my shelf.  I figure I'll start at the beginning and do them all again, eventually.  My point is that these stories are well worth that sort of attention. The BBC always does these sorts of things so well. The Warden was published in 1855, and Barchester Towers in 1857. They center on the cathedral town of Barchester, which includes a hospital/old folks' home for retired weavers, the cathedral itself, and a variety of other Church of England institutions which figure heavily in the stories. The Warden of the hospital is a kind, gentle, unworldly little churchman with two daughters. One is married to the archdeacon, assistant to the Bishop of Barchester, very ambitious and not a little odious. His wife has a level head, however, and manages to keep him from doing anything too horrible.The Warden's younger daughter Eleanor is by far the more complex character, mostly because she is so very desirable to a variety of people, most of whom seem quite unconcerned about what she wants or who she might love. Who she actually does love is thus a central part of the plot, and I won't spoil it for you. But I will reveal that the husband she eventually marries in part one dies while their child is still an infant, and the second part of the story she is equally lovable (perhaps more, as you will discover) as a widow.Her husband's sister Mary, who is pert and pretty and intelligent, and for reasons I do not understand is not pursued by the flock of men with marriage intentions, lives with Eleanor and helps with the care of her nephew. They share many a giggle at the expense of the foolish men who pursue Eleanor, including Obidiah Slope, played to perfection by a young Alan Rickman (a.k.a. Severus Snape). Mary has heard that he changed his name from Slop.There's a lively mix of humor, drama and romance here, and I don't want to spoil anything. I offer this warning, however: don't assume you know who to like and who to dislike among the characters. Several of them change, or at least the audience's perception of them is changed by events.",5,Brilliant Anthony Trollope Story,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,2172,"['read', 'Barchester', 'series', 'great', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'recently', 'rest', 'are', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'figure', ""'ll"", 'start', 'beginning', 'do', 'again', 'eventually', 'point', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'sort', 'attention', 'BBC', 'always', 'sorts', 'things', 'so', 'well', 'Warden', 'was', 'published', '1855', 'Barchester', 'Towers', '1857', 'center', 'cathedral', 'town', 'Barchester', 'hospital/old', 'folks', 'home', 'retired', 'weavers', 'cathedral', 'variety', 'other', 'Church', 'England', 'institutions', 'figure', 'heavily', 'stories', 'Warden', 'hospital', 'kind', 'gentle', 'unworldly', 'little', 'churchman', 'two', 'daughters', 'One', 'married', 'archdeacon', 'assistant', 'Bishop', 'Barchester', 'very', 'ambitious', 'not', 'little', 'odious', 'wife', 'level', 'head', 'however', 'keep', 'doing', 'anything', 'too', 'horrible.The', 'Warden', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Eleanor', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'mostly', 'so', 'very', 'desirable', 'variety', 'people', 'most', 'whom', 'seem', 'quite', 'unconcerned', 'what', 'who', 'might', 'love', 'Who', 'actually', 'love', 'thus', 'central', 'part', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'will', 'reveal', 'husband', 'eventually', 'marries', 'part', 'one', 'child', 'still', 'infant', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'equally', 'lovable', 'perhaps', 'more', 'will', 'discover', 'widow.Her', 'husband', 'sister', 'Mary', 'who', 'pert', 'pretty', 'intelligent', 'reasons', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'not', 'pursued', 'flock', 'men', 'marriage', 'intentions', 'Eleanor', 'care', 'nephew', 'share', 'many', 'giggle', 'expense', 'foolish', 'men', 'who', 'pursue', 'Eleanor', 'including', 'Obidiah', 'Slope', 'played', 'perfection', 'young', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'a.k.a', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'Mary', 'heard', 'changed', 'name', 'Slop.There', 'lively', 'mix', 'humor', 'drama', 'romance', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'offer', 'warning', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'know', 'who', 'like', 'who', 'dislike', 'characters', 'Several', 'change', 'least', 'audience', 'perception', 'changed', 'events']",N/A

Trollope did not hold back from peeling back the facade oftitle, position & religion to reveal the unlovley petty, grasping selfishness that lurks behind every humanface.I continued watching, wondering if the starkness of depravity in the church would completely overshadow thestories in each episode.

861217,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B00065GX96,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[254, 262]","There must really be a god; the commercial release of the BBC production of Anthony Trollope's ""The Barchester Chronicles"" is answer to this heathen's prayers.  I watched this presentation on A&E; (having missed the PBS program) in the mid-1980s and managed to make a very poor tape of the program.  Since that time I wished intently that The Barchester Chronicles would become commercially available before I die.  Now it is on DVD! (and obviously I'm not dead either) This BBC presentation is one of the best things I have ever witnessed either on stage, big screen or small screen.Although the ads to this DVD emphasize that Alan Rickman has a leading role, (he IS wonderful) he is NOT the only superb actor in this film; he is just one of many!  Everyone in this presentation gives an outstanding performance. As stated before Alan Rickman is wonderful as the slimy Mr. Slope (really Slop; however, he added the ""e""!)-watch how he moves like a snake which the character is!)  His sparing partner is Geraldine McEwen.  They start off as ""chums"" but by the end of the story they are bitter enemies.  Their ""duals"" will have you on the floor with laughter.  Geraldine is most frightening as the bishop's wife (actually she is the REAL bishop and has all of the power because her husband has no spine and is given to numbing migraine headaches brought on by his wife-the bishop's role is played delightfully by Clive Swift).  One of my favorite actors, the late great Nigel Hawthorne plays the ""about to explode  at all times"" Archdeacon who tries to keep things as they are while the Clergyman (Rickman) and the ferocious Bishop's wife (McEwen) are determined to change things  to their own benefit.  (Proof that Sir Nigel was a great actor is to be had by comparing his performance as the Archdeacon in Barchester with his fabulous performance as Georgie Pillson in ""Mapp and Lucia""; you won't think it's the same person that is playing both roles--he was amazing!!)In the midst of all of these goings on is the calming presence and moral fortitude of the clergymen (Warden) as played by Donald Pleasence.I've named just a few of the actors and the characters they play.  There is much much more!! There is a host of great actors giving superb performances including Susan Hampshire.Don't be deterred by what could be perceived as a little ""slowness"" in the first episode; it's just ""laying the groundwork"" for the ""riot"" that is to come.  Believe me it will be one of the greatest things you have ever seen.  The production, camera work direction and most of all the acting is truly awesome!Now, I can truly die happy!  The Barchester Chronicles has been finally released commercially  and I'm thrilled as you will be if you buy his DVD!ADDENDUM TO THE ABOVE REVIEW:The DVD picture and sound quality of The Barchester Chronicles is superb!! Having seen the original presentation, I truly feel that the quality is far superior.

861219,A25E01HTNT53KL,B00065GX96,James M. Rawley,"[6, 9]","There are people who don't like BBC dramatizations of nineteenth century novels. I am one of those people. Naturally, I don't get much chance to review such dramatizations, because I don't watch them, because I don't like them.But I was reading THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER TOWERS when the DVD turned up in a store, right under my hand, even though the show was filmed in the eighties. Naturally, I picked it up, -- and it was full of the things I don't like about BBC dramatizations. Here are some of them. Far from all. The problems with these dramatizations never stop. But some.The main serious love interest in the story is Mr. Arabin, an Oxford scholar and clergyman who is also a poetry teacher. He gets the usual twenty-page introduction from Trollope, and several strolls in the garden with Mrs. Bold, whom he will eventually marry. In the tv series, he is introduced at the dinner table, midway through his falling in love with Mrs. Bold: the audience is not told the state of his emotions, and never learns anything about his character or background. Later on, a woman advises Mrs. Bold to go after him because ""he loves you."" That's far from being enough to tell the audience anything about the character of the man the heroine is going to marry.I suspect the writers of the adaptation were told by critics that the love story was a minor part of the novel. That is not true, but no matter how minor it was, it shouldn't have been reduced to an unexplained lightning flash this way.Dr. Grantly is played by an excellent actor, who has been directed to become apoplectic with rage every time he hears about Bishop Proudie or his chaplain, Slope. These apoplectic rages turn his well-acted character into a carricature, and turn Trollope's subtle comedy into a very broad burlesque. One of the major points of the comic novel is that all these clergymen, and their wives, except for the unusually Christian Dr. Harding, are extraordinarily subtle and deft at political maneuvering. That's the theme of the story. Dr. Grantly is one of the defter politicians in the book. To reduce him to a sputtering fool denatures the novel.The charming rascal, Bertie Stanhope, refuses to make money, which drives his father crazy. His sister, who runs the family (a point the BBC adaptation leaves out, though it ties in very importantly with the general theme of the power of women in Barsetshire), suggests he marry the rich Mrs. Bold. Since this, too, is a way to make money, the scamp doesn't want to do that either -- another subtle comic point the BBC leaves out -- and proposes to Mrs. Bold in the novel in such a way that she sees the whole point of what he's doing, sees he's not serious, and in a totally friendly spirit turns him down.In the BBC adaptation she tells him she wanted to slap him, in absolute violation of her mood in the novel. She tells him this in such a way that he doesn't quite understand it, then immediately, within one line, tells him she hopes she has been friendly in her refusal! This makes less than no sense at all, and only slides by (if it does) because the audience assumes Victorians were nuts about being polite.Meanwhile Bertie loses all credit for having told her all about his sister's schemes and his own indifference to them. The audience never finds out about that, and so his character loses richness, which the fine actor playing Bertie has to make up for by personal charm. He is indeed charming, but the best part of him has been left out, and no amount of good acting can make up for that. At the same time Mrs. Bold, whose power to love is subtle and complex, is turned into a self-contradictory cardboard fool.In other words, the characters behave at once too broadly for a subtle comedy, and too inconsistently for any kind of a good drama at all. What the heck. Novels are hard to change into tv serials, and if the drama were told with the same depth, and at the same pace, as the books, most watchers would be bored. To keep the show interesting, it's cut to pieces (nothing of the main love affair is left but the proposal) and turned into a Marx Brothers outing as much as possible. Since that's not so very possible after all, we get broad burlesque that isn't broad enough and mincing clerical soap opera with the plot taken away. And all this is supposed to add up to greatness.I could go on and on. Trollope is a fine novelist, but his novels, like most Victorian novels, are mostly the author speaking in his own voice about the thoughts and feelings of his characters. They are wonderful reading for those who like them as I do, but they are not dramas and do not pretend to be. The BBC adaptations are not dramas either, and they DO pretend to be. So I mostly don't watch them.Don't think I'm alone, though. Pauline Kael is not the only professional critic to use ""MASTERPIECE THEATER"" as a synonym for ponderousness and pretentiousness.",3,Not Good.

861220,A17JVI15BRY90P,B00065GX96,James T. Wheeler,"[21, 21]","There were many fine productions from the golden age of Masterpiece Theatre, from the late-1970's to the early-1990's.  These included ""The Wilderness Years,"" ""To Serve Them All My Days,"" ""I, Claudius,"" ""Poldark,"" and ""Pride and Prejudice."" Nevertheless, ""The Barchester Chronicles"" has always been our favorite and is an almost perfect combination of story line, casting, scenery, and writing.Viewers must be struck by the amazing hypocrisy shown by men and women of the cloth in 19th century England.  As such, ""The Barchester Chronicles"" may be seen as a morality play on political in-fighting that goes on in any large organization, be it a private corporation or an unit of government.It would be impossible to name the most outstanding performance in this series, although Donald Pleasence, as warden of Hiram's hospital, merits top billing.  Nigel Hawthorne as Dr. Grantly, Alan Rickman as Mr. Slope, and Geraldine McEwan as Mrs. Proudie are all outstanding.  The supporting cast is great, too, as even the most casual observer would see.Most memorable quotes from the excellent screenplay are many and varied. These include the following from the warden: ""There are some things in life we are meant not to understand.  But we must try.""  ""Can man find salvation in legal quibble?"" ""I thought it was one of my virtues"" (said in reply to the rebuke from Dr. Grantley that he too often sees the other person's point of view).Alan Rickman's portrayal of Obidiah Slope is a tour de force in treachery and sneering.  Slope has to be one of the most enduring villains in English literature.  His parting statement to the bishop and Mrs. Proudie, ""May you both live forever,"" sums up feelings of viewers as they watch the series.Nigel Hawthorne as the archdeacon, Dr. Grantly, is inspired casting.  One has to wonder, watching his repeated outbursts, how Mr. Hawthorne avoided having a stroke before production closed.  In addition to his perpetual, ""Good Heavens,"" he also has several memorable lines, particularly when speaking of ""destroying the bestial Slope.""Geraldine McEwan as the bishop's wife, Mrs. Proudie, is also very well cast in her part.  To everyone involved she is the obvious power behind the throne and proves it to a dismissed Mr. Slope in the end.  Her most memorable lines begin with, ""The Bishop believes, and I agree with him....""One or more reviewers have commented that the DVD may be missing scenes from the TV production.  My wife and I watched for this and seemed to find the opposite.  While the TV installments averaged about 48 minutes in length (taped from the A&E; Network), the DVD segments were each, 51-54 minutes.  Some scenes cut out on A&E; were really important ones for an understanding of who was doing what to whom.  These scenes may or may not have been included in the original showing on PBS.  In any case, we were very happy to find them on the DVD, along with its highly superior picture and sound quality.  (We could even see dust stirred up by horse-drawn carriages as they sauntered across the screen).  Anyone who might be undecided about buying the DVD should rest assured that it's really worth the money.  Moreover, the tidbits offered on the cast and crew and the 30-minute documentary on Peterborough cathedral provideuseful background to the outstanding comedy/drama.",5,Best of Masterpiece Theatre,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,3326,"['were', 'many', 'fine', 'productions', 'golden', 'age', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'late-1970', 'early-1990', 'included', 'Wilderness', 'Years', 'Serve', 'Them', 'All', 'My', 'Days', 'Claudius', 'Poldark', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Nevertheless', 'Barchester', 'Chronicles', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'almost', 'perfect', 'combination', 'story', 'line', 'casting', 'scenery', 'writing.Viewers', 'must', 'be', 'struck', 'amazing', 'hypocrisy', 'shown', 'men', 'women', 'cloth', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'such', 'Barchester', 'Chronicles', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'morality', 'play', 'political', 'in-fighting', 'large', 'organization', 'be', 'private', 'corporation', 'unit', 'government.It', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'name', 'most', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'series', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'warden', 'Hiram', 'hospital', 'merits', 'top', 'billing', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'Dr.', 'Grantly', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Mr.', 'Slope', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'Mrs.', 'Proudie', 'are', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'too', 'even', 'most', 'casual', 'observer', 'would', 'see.Most', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'are', 'many', 'varied', 'include', 'following', 'warden', 'are', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'meant', 'not', 'understand', 'must', 'try', 'Can', 'man', 'find', 'salvation', 'legal', 'quibble', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'virtues', 'said', 'reply', 'rebuke', 'Dr.', 'Grantley', 'too', 'often', 'other', 'person', 'point', 'view', '.Alan', 'Rickman', 'portrayal', 'Obidiah', 'Slope', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'treachery', 'sneering', 'Slope', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'enduring', 'villains', 'English', 'literature', 'parting', 'statement', 'bishop', 'Mrs.', 'Proudie', 'May', 'live', 'forever', 'up', 'feelings', 'viewers', 'watch', 'series.Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'archdeacon', 'Dr.', 'Grantly', 'inspired', 'casting', 'One', 'wonder', 'watching', 'repeated', 'outbursts', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Hawthorne', 'avoided', 'having', 'stroke', 'production', 'closed', 'addition', 'perpetual', 'Good', 'Heavens', 'also', 'several', 'memorable', 'lines', 'particularly', 'when', 'speaking', 'destroying', 'bestial', 'Slope', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'bishop', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Proudie', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'part', 'everyone', 'involved', 'obvious', 'power', 'throne', 'dismissed', 'Mr.', 'Slope', 'end', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'begin', 'Bishop', 'agree', 'One', 'more', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'missing', 'scenes', 'TV', 'production', 'wife', 'watched', 'seemed', 'find', 'opposite', 'TV', 'installments', 'averaged', '48', 'minutes', 'length', 'taped', 'A', 'E', 'Network', 'DVD', 'segments', 'were', '51-54', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'cut', 'out', 'A', 'E', 'were', 'really', 'important', 'ones', 'understanding', 'who', 'was', 'doing', 'what', 'whom', 'scenes', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'original', 'showing', 'PBS', 'case', 'were', 'very', 'happy', 'find', 'DVD', 'highly', 'superior', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'could', 'even', 'see', 'dust', 'stirred', 'up', 'horse-drawn', 'carriages', 'sauntered', 'screen', 'Anyone', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'undecided', 'buying', 'DVD', 'should', 'rest', 'assured', 'really', 'worth', 'money', 'Moreover', 'tidbits', 'offered', 'cast', 'crew', '30-minute', 'documentary', 'Peterborough', 'cathedral', 'provideuseful', 'background', 'outstanding', 'comedy/drama']",N/A

861222,A106016KSI0YQ,B00065GX96,Jay Dickson,"[5, 7]","The adaptors of Trollope's WARDEN and BARCHESTER TOWERS for the BBC keyed in exactly to the keynote of the second of these works, the most famous of Trollope's novels, and gave this miniseries the kind of ferocious energy with which Trollope's Barsetshire clergymen and their wives and daughters fight their amazingly highpitched manic battles over trivialities. The most satisfying moments in this series recognize either the slapstick humor in the original or its divergences into sentimental reflections upon goodness and kindness (the fine casting of Donald Pleasance as the Rev. Mr. Harding, the pivot upon which the entirety revolves, allows for occasions for the latter). While the casting is for the most part first-rate (particularly Nigel Hawthorne as the splenetic Archdeacon Grantly, Peter Blythe as the silly wastrel Bertie Stanhope, and Alan Rickman as the unctuous Obadiah Slope), Geraldine McEwan plays the role of the domineering Mrs. Proudie on far too gigantic a scale. While Mrs. Proudie is certainly Trollope's most larger-than-life creation, McEwan delivers her lines with so much intensity that she disrupts the rhythms of almost every scene she's in.

861232,A2L6QS8SVHT9RG,B00065GX96,"randomartco ""period film aficionado""","[112, 119]","BBC & Trollope's fascinating look at corruption in the Church of EnglandBased on the book by Anthony Trollope, ""The Barchester Chronicles,"" is a fascinating and satirical look at corruption in the Church of England, and the reformers who wish to make changes, and end up getting more than they bargained for.Reverend Septimus Harding (Donald Pleasence), a decent, gentle and caring man who values music and it's relation to God above all else, is the clergyman in charge of Hiram's Hospital.  John Hiram, a rich and influential man, has died decades before, leaving money for the forming and management of a men's hospital, intended for worn out old men to take refuge in the country and live their last days out in peace.  Appointed by Bishop Grantly (Cyril Luckham) to his post almost 12 years ago, Rev. Harding is suddenly attacked in a lawsuit by reformers who claim that corruption and nepotism have invaded into the town of Barchester.  They begin calling for reform and although the lawsuit is defeated at the end, Rev. Harding ends by honorably resigning from Hiram's Hospital, to live poorly and struggle on as a clergyman in Barchester.Not too long after, a change in government calls for a change in church leadership: when a new prime minister is named just as Bishop Grantly passes away, Dr. Grantly (who had hoped to become the next bishop) is passed over for a new appointment: Bishop Proudie.  Enter Alan Rickman (in an early role pulled off with resounding success), playing the fantastically flirtatious and social-climbing devious chaplin, Reverend Obadiah Slope.  Slope is chaplin to shy, quiet, stammering Bishop Proudie, who is controlled by his wife, Mrs. Proudie (Geraldine McEwan), in nearly everything he does.  A few other characters thrown into the mix, including the beautiful and crippled Signora Madeline Neroni (Susan Hampshire) and her rakish brother, combine to create a mesmerizing tale of love and the thirst for power.As Slope and Mrs. Proudie (who began as ""great friends) priggishly fight on for control over Bishop Proudie and his actions, ambition takes on a new meaning.  A church appointment is made by one, and contradicted by the other: another appointment is made and overturned by the other: it creates a delightful almost-comedy of errors in which you chuckle at the power struggle and feel sorry for the innocent people affected so deeply by it.Content:  There is no language to speak of, and very little ""violence"" (if you can even call it that): a woman slaps a man (with good reason).  Many discussions take place about corruption and nepotism in the Church of England, and the need for reform: nothing untoward is mentioned, other than that men are appointed and paid for doing very little work: nothing to do with Christianity, the reform is do with the church, its appointments, and its care of the people of Britain.  Other content: a man flirts outrageously with many women, and a woman flirts with many men.On the whole, a very unobjectionable film that entertains and delights on one hand, even as you can't help but be saddened and appalled at the actions of some on the other hand. What amazes me most about the power-hungry actions of some characters is that all this takes place in the relatively small town of Barchester.  Overall, this 1982 TV mini-series by BBC gives a fascinating in-depth look at the clergy and church reform, as it so realistically just might have been.",4,BBC/Trollope's fascinating look at corruption in the Church,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,3439,"['BBC', 'Trollope', 'fascinating', 'look', 'corruption', 'Church', 'EnglandBased', 'book', 'Anthony', 'Trollope', 'Barchester', 'Chronicles', 'fascinating', 'satirical', 'look', 'corruption', 'Church', 'England', 'reformers', 'who', 'wish', 'make', 'changes', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'more', 'bargained', 'for.Reverend', 'Septimus', 'Harding', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'decent', 'gentle', 'caring', 'man', 'who', 'music', 'relation', 'God', 'else', 'clergyman', 'charge', 'Hiram', 'Hospital', 'John', 'Hiram', 'rich', 'influential', 'man', 'died', 'decades', 'leaving', 'money', 'forming', 'management', 'men', 'hospital', 'intended', 'worn', 'old', 'men', 'take', 'refuge', 'country', 'live', 'last', 'days', 'out', 'peace', 'Appointed', 'Bishop', 'Grantly', 'Cyril', 'Luckham', 'post', 'almost', '12', 'years', 'ago', 'Rev', 'Harding', 'suddenly', 'attacked', 'lawsuit', 'reformers', 'who', 'claim', 'corruption', 'nepotism', 'have', 'invaded', 'town', 'Barchester', 'begin', 'calling', 'reform', 'lawsuit', 'defeated', 'end', 'Rev', 'Harding', 'ends', 'honorably', 'resigning', 'Hiram', 'Hospital', 'live', 'poorly', 'struggle', 'clergyman', 'Barchester.Not', 'too', 'long', 'change', 'government', 'calls', 'change', 'church', 'leadership', 'when', 'new', 'prime', 'minister', 'named', 'just', 'Bishop', 'Grantly', 'away', 'Dr.', 'Grantly', 'who', 'had', 'hoped', 'become', 'next', 'bishop', 'passed', 'new', 'appointment', 'Bishop', 'Proudie', 'Enter', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'early', 'role', 'pulled', 'off', 'resounding', 'success', 'playing', 'fantastically', 'flirtatious', 'social-climbing', 'devious', 'chaplin', 'Reverend', 'Obadiah', 'Slope', 'Slope', 'chaplin', 'shy', 'quiet', 'stammering', 'Bishop', 'Proudie', 'who', 'controlled', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Proudie', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'nearly', 'everything', 'few', 'other', 'characters', 'thrown', 'mix', 'including', 'beautiful', 'crippled', 'Signora', 'Madeline', 'Neroni', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'rakish', 'brother', 'combine', 'create', 'mesmerizing', 'tale', 'love', 'thirst', 'power.As', 'Slope', 'Mrs.', 'Proudie', 'who', 'began', 'great', 'friends', 'priggishly', 'fight', 'control', 'Bishop', 'Proudie', 'actions', 'ambition', 'new', 'meaning', 'church', 'appointment', 'made', 'one', 'contradicted', 'other', 'appointment', 'made', 'overturned', 'other', 'delightful', 'almost-comedy', 'errors', 'chuckle', 'power', 'struggle', 'feel', 'sorry', 'innocent', 'people', 'affected', 'so', 'deeply', 'it.Content', 'language', 'speak', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'can', 'even', 'call', 'woman', 'man', 'good', 'reason', 'Many', 'discussions', 'take', 'place', 'corruption', 'nepotism', 'Church', 'England', 'need', 'reform', 'nothing', 'untoward', 'mentioned', 'other', 'men', 'are', 'appointed', 'paid', 'doing', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'nothing', 'do', 'Christianity', 'reform', 'do', 'church', 'appointments', 'care', 'people', 'Britain', 'Other', 'content', 'man', 'outrageously', 'many', 'women', 'woman', 'many', 'men.On', 'whole', 'very', 'unobjectionable', 'film', 'delights', 'one', 'hand', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'saddened', 'appalled', 'actions', 'other', 'hand', 'What', 'most', 'power-hungry', 'actions', 'characters', 'place', 'relatively', 'small', 'town', 'Barchester', 'Overall', '1982', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'BBC', 'fascinating', 'in-depth', 'look', 'clergy', 'church', 'reform', 'so', 'realistically', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Anthony Trollope wrote four more novels in the series; as far as I know, there are no similar adaptations of those novels. While the later Palliser novels dealt with the English aristocracy in Victorian England, the Barchester series deals with Church of England clergy in the mythical English county of Barsetshire (located approximately where the real Dorset lies) and its mythical cathedral town of Barchester. As in all Trollope stories, the characters, motivations, politics, manipulations, and shenanigans are complex and timeless.The cast is nearly perfect. The first half of the series stars Donald Pleasance as Rev. Septimus Harding. He is wonderful in this roll: a gentle soul who has a case of conscience. Donald's real life daughter Angela Pleasence stars as Susan Grantly. The always delightful Susan Hampshire has a supporting role as Signora Madeline Neroni. Alan Rickman plays (to snake-like perfection) the scheming Obadiah Slope.If you like Trollope, then also check out:The Way We Live NowandThe Pallisers - The Complete Collection.

Much of the story centers around the lives of clergymen and their offspring in the 19th century and how they fought political battles for better positions in the church and personal battles for better social and financial positions.Donald Pleasance is billed as the lead actor in the series and is the focus of the first two parts but then becomes more of a supporting character whom others actions are woven around. Around part 3, Alan Rickman's Obediah Slope (the ""villain"") becomes much more pivotal as his manipulation of those around him is at the center of most of the action. In fact, manipulation on nearly every level is a great deal of what occurs in the series. It is so pervasive that there are very few characters who are actually all that likable. Even many of the ""good"" characters come across as duplicitous and insincere as they work Slope's ambitions to their favor by pretending to be duped by his act.This all makes for rather interesting viewing and a very soap-like feel to the series.There are only a few ""weak points"" in my opinion. The first is that the story starts rather slowly due to the way the first two parts establish Mr. Harding's character and situation. I think that no more than one part should have been spent doing so. The second is the absolute distraction of Susan Hampshire's appearance in a period piece. She was 45 at the time that she portrayed Senora Neroni, a great and presumably somewhat younger than 45 beauty, and a clearly obvious (and overdone) nose job and tightly-pulled facelift made it hard for this viewer to stay in the story and accept the character every time she appeared onscreen.Nonetheless, I would recommend this DVD to any fan of this sort of BBC drama. The story has increasing momentum and you do find yourself wondering where the characters will be by the end. It's extremely well-acted and worthy of the viewer's attention.",4,19th century soap opera goodness,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,2006,"['heart', 'Barchester', 'Chornicles', 'story', 'corruption', 'wastefulness', 'Church', 'England', 'Much', 'story', 'centers', 'lives', 'clergymen', 'offspring', '19th', 'century', 'how', 'fought', 'political', 'battles', 'better', 'positions', 'church', 'personal', 'battles', 'better', 'social', 'financial', 'positions.Donald', 'Pleasance', 'billed', 'lead', 'actor', 'series', 'focus', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'then', 'more', 'supporting', 'character', 'whom', 'others', 'actions', 'are', 'woven', 'part', '3', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Obediah', 'Slope', 'villain', 'much', 'more', 'pivotal', 'manipulation', 'center', 'most', 'action', 'fact', 'manipulation', 'nearly', 'level', 'great', 'deal', 'what', 'series', 'so', 'pervasive', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'likable', 'Even', 'many', 'good', 'characters', 'come', 'duplicitous', 'insincere', 'work', 'Slope', 'ambitions', 'favor', 'pretending', 'be', 'duped', 'act.This', 'rather', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'very', 'soap-like', 'feel', 'series.There', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'weak', 'points', 'opinion', 'first', 'story', 'rather', 'slowly', 'due', 'way', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'establish', 'Mr.', 'Harding', 'character', 'situation', 'think', 'more', 'one', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'doing', 'so', 'second', 'absolute', 'distraction', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'appearance', 'period', 'piece', 'was', '45', 'time', 'portrayed', 'Senora', 'Neroni', 'great', 'presumably', 'somewhat', 'younger', '45', 'beauty', 'clearly', 'obvious', 'overdone', 'nose', 'job', 'tightly-pulled', 'facelift', 'made', 'hard', 'viewer', 'stay', 'story', 'accept', 'character', 'time', 'appeared', 'onscreen.Nonetheless', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'fan', 'sort', 'BBC', 'drama', 'story', 'increasing', 'momentum', 'do', 'find', 'wondering', 'where', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'end', 'extremely', 'well-acted', 'worthy', 'viewer', 'attention']",N/A

As others have noted, all the actors give great performances, and the humor is kick-your-heels riotous.  Alan Rickman as Obadiah Slop(e) (hubby and I love the places where ladies say that Mr. Sleope's behaviuh is eodious) is enough to make the series great, but there is so much more!Even the little baby in the piece is a good actor.  Trollope was a comic genius and the makers of this series have done him full honor.  I find myself nearly speechless in trying to describe the beauty of the scenes, the humor of the exchanges, the glory of the costumes...We Americans, or a certain subset of us, have a strange nostalgia for an older England even if our mongrel ancestry is mostly German or something else.  I'm certainly in the nostalgic group.  The churches, cathedral scenes, old buildings, and so forth will make you yearn to be there, to walk beneath Gothic arches and hear a boy-choir sing its high, breathy anthem.That said, I did get the feeling that too much was squeezed into the last episode, as though more had been filmed but time constraints had required it to be cut.  In particular, the events of a certain garden party are only described by the actors, and we'd have LOVED to have seen them ourselves!  There are even a couple of character motives which are not explained, as in the case of a lady who rather favored a certain wooer but has turned against him....and others.

Without reviewing the lengthy story line of the Barchester Chronicles, I must say that the English and some of their earlier writers have a very dim view of the clergy in general. But with that said, I found some pretty good redeeming qualities about the story in which there was the typical clash between good and evil, with most of the good parts falling into place at the end. This story allowed a glimpse of how hard and cruel things were back in the developing years of England's Great society. The good and kind old minister of God, has his faithful following to support him and show him love, but when promotion and opportunity come, there's the devil trying the gunk up the whole place. In this case, the devil came in the form of chaplains and bishops and the bishops wife. But throughout it all, I was struck with loyality to the man of God who did not compromise his integrity and who kept the perspective of the big picture.

861241,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B00065GX96,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[30, 31]","Based on The Warden and Barchester Towers, the first two of Anthony Trollope's six ""Barsetshire"" novels, The Barchester Chronicles is an intelligent, witty, and deliciously humorous 1982 dramatisation set in 1850s' England in the fictional town of Barchester.  The series focuses on corruption within the church and the battle between conservatism and modernism which threatened to tear it apart.  An interest in church politics of the time is not necessary, however, for this is as much a story about the individuals involved as it is about the church.  The series, which is faithful to the original novels, consists of seven 50-minute episodes and features an all-star British cast.  DVD extras: Text-based bios and (oddly) a 30-minute profile of Peterborough Cathedral.Donald Pleasence stars as gentle, non-confrontational, soft-spoken, kind-hearted Mr. Harding, the caring Warden of a small hospital within the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Barchester.  With few responsibilities and a wopping annual income of 800 pounds, it's a plum position.  Sadly for him, however, misappropriation of church funds (of which this is a prime example) is a bone that the sensation-seeking Jupiter newspaper has decided to chew on; and they have chosen Mr. Harding as their target.Being a good, decent man, it appals Mr. Harding that anyone should think him guilty of acting immorally or unethically.  Whilst the unassuming Mr. Harding would be content to just fade into the woodwork, he is blessed (or should I say ""cursed"") with a very intelligent and shrewd but hot-headed and domineering son-in-law, Dr. Grantley (played to absolute perfection by Nigel Hawthorne--Yes (Prime) Minister's Sir Humphrey), who just happens to be Archdeacon and the son of the old Bishop, and who enjoys nothing more than a good battle.Barchester Towers (arguably Trollope's most famous and best-loved novel) commences with the third episode, and it is with this episode that the fun really starts.  In a nutshell, the series from here on deals with the clash between the conservative arm of the church (represented in part by Mr. Harding, Dr. Grantley, and the now-deceased old Bishop) and the oppressive new modern movement, which finds its followers in the newly-appointed Bishop and his clan.  The new Bishop, Dr. Proudie (Clive Swift--Keeping Up Appearances' Richard Bucket!), is a soft-spoken, indecisive, submissive, hen-pecked man void of anything resembling a back-bone.  His domineering battle-axe of a wife, Mrs. Proudie (Geraldine McEwan--Mapp & Lucia, Mulberry), is the real power behind the throne.  Her obsequious creature is their chaplain, the odious, self-serving and highly ambitious Mr. Slope (splendidly portrayed by Alan Rickman), who positively oozes insincerity and haughtiness.Like most toadies, Slope is only subservient if it's to his advantage, and it's not long before he sets himself upon a course that is destined to alienate Mrs. Proudie.  Upon discovering that Mr. Harding's widowed daughter, Eleanor, is wealthy, Slope becomes determined to win her admiration and thereby her hand.  But his ambition is not enough to prevent this loathesome womanizer from professing his love and devotion to the beautiful (albeit highly intelligent, insightful, and very forthright!) Senora Neroni (Susan Hampshire--The Pallisers, The First Churchills, The Forsyte Saga).  As Mrs. Proudie does not approve of the attention Slope pays to either women, a battle for dominance between the two power-hungry erstwhile allies is inevitable.In conclusion, this is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy-drama which I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys intelligent, witty, insightful, clean, impeccably-acted British comedies or period productions.
