I am not sure it is featured on the DVD of this release, but I hope it is added to ALL future Disney blue-ray discs releases of the classics, it is * Inside Walt's Story Meetings - Enhanced interactive edition"".You can select this method and what it is is, actors performing the original ""sweat box meetings"" where they discuss developing the entire movie.  All you hear are the voice of the actors playing Walt and the Animators, but you see stills of them working or concept drawings related to the film as it plays on the screen itself.  Now keep in mind the film playing is not the entire image, it is mixed with sketches, drawings, paintings, test animations and pictures of the animators working, etc.  It gives you a live indepth look into the thoughts behind the emotional choices for characters, story, etc.  Hands down THE best bonus feature Disney has ever added.  And every once in a while you hear a subject matter like a character choice or a song choice or lighting and it gives you an option on the screen on bottom to hit enter when you want to branch off and hear and see more on the subject, then it takes you right back to where you left off.

78901,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0788806270,Acute Observer,"[4, 81]","Bambi, 1942 filmAdapted from the story by Felix Salten for America and the world of 1942. It opens on a gray murky world that soon changes to bright colors. Small furry animals appear, without any cares or concerns. What an idyllic world! How different from the events in front of the screen. This colorful land has only happy times. There is no unemployment, poverty, war, or hunger. April showers are followed by the sun's warmth. Bambi soon learns that there are places that are not safe, like the meadow (no mention of the danger). The scenes of the animal movements show artistic excellence; they must have cost a fortune. A flight of crows signal an alarm, and the deer flee into the forest. The danger is ""man in the forest"". [Isn't this just brainwashing young children?]The snows of winter arrive. More scenes of animal movements pad out this story. The tough times show the hungry deer stripping bark from the trees (doesn't this kill trees and damage the forest?). Shots ring out, and Bambi's mother is gone. Spring brings singing birds in preparation for the summer. Bambi has grown antlers, and has matured. He battles and wins his mate. But men have come into the land, and there is danger. A pack of hounds chase poor Feleen. Bambi arrives to save her, and they escape. But a shot hits Bambi, and he falls. Fire spreads from the camp into the forest, destroying their habitat. Most of the animals escape to an island in the lake. Bambi is reunited with Feleen, and twins are born.The excellent draftsmanship doesn't mask a weak storyline. I saw this as a child over 60 years ago, but remember little. This story was designed to be anti-hunting, and anti-human. Is such a perverse film fit for children? The depiction of those dangerous dogs may disturb some pet owners. What does this say about Walt Disney? The film does not show how man eliminated the wolves, panthers, and bears that preyed upon animals like deer. The film shows no conflicting interests, unlike the lawn outside where birds hunt and dispute their territory.",1,Animal Forest,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2043,"['Bambi', '1942', 'filmAdapted', 'story', 'Felix', 'Salten', 'America', 'world', '1942', 'gray', 'murky', 'world', 'soon', 'changes', 'bright', 'colors', 'Small', 'furry', 'animals', 'appear', 'cares', 'concerns', 'What', 'idyllic', 'world', 'How', 'different', 'events', 'front', 'screen', 'colorful', 'land', 'only', 'happy', 'times', 'unemployment', 'poverty', 'war', 'hunger', 'April', 'showers', 'are', 'followed', 'sun', 'warmth', 'Bambi', 'soon', 'are', 'places', 'are', 'not', 'safe', 'meadow', 'mention', 'danger', 'scenes', 'animal', 'movements', 'show', 'artistic', 'excellence', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'fortune', 'flight', 'crows', 'signal', 'alarm', 'deer', 'flee', 'forest', 'danger', 'man', 'forest', '[', ""n't"", 'just', 'brainwashing', 'young', 'children', ']', 'snows', 'winter', 'arrive', 'More', 'scenes', 'animal', 'movements', 'pad', 'out', 'story', 'tough', 'times', 'show', 'hungry', 'deer', 'stripping', 'bark', 'trees', ""n't"", 'kill', 'trees', 'damage', 'forest', 'Shots', 'ring', 'out', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'gone', 'Spring', 'singing', 'birds', 'preparation', 'summer', 'Bambi', 'grown', 'antlers', 'matured', 'mate', 'men', 'have', 'come', 'land', 'danger', 'pack', 'hounds', 'chase', 'poor', 'Feleen', 'Bambi', 'save', 'escape', 'shot', 'hits', 'Bambi', 'Fire', 'camp', 'forest', 'destroying', 'habitat', 'Most', 'animals', 'escape', 'island', 'lake', 'Bambi', 'reunited', 'Feleen', 'twins', 'are', 'born.The', 'excellent', 'draftsmanship', ""n't"", 'mask', 'weak', 'storyline', 'saw', 'child', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'little', 'story', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'anti-hunting', 'anti-human', 'such', 'perverse', 'film', 'fit', 'children', 'depiction', 'dangerous', 'dogs', 'may', 'disturb', 'pet', 'owners', 'What', 'say', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'film', 'not', 'show', 'how', 'man', 'eliminated', 'wolves', 'panthers', 'preyed', 'animals', 'deer', 'film', 'conflicting', 'interests', 'lawn', 'where', 'birds', 'hunt', 'dispute', 'territory']",N/A

Its Disney's fifth platinum DVD edition and it's full of spectacular features.  The most advanced technology has been used to bring you an all new digital restoration of the film with enhanced picture and sound. It took 9,600 hours of work to touch up over 110,000 frames all by hand. Also purist will be glad that the original theatrical soundtrack has been restored.Go inside Walt Disney's story meetings which is close to an audio commentary, only it's better. You see most of the film, but you also see artwork from the film as well as clips from other films. The audio is a reenactment of meetings that Walt had with his filmmakers in the production of Bambi. There is even a man who sounds like Walt Disney himself. You will see how Disney's short cartoons and feature films offered inspiration to Bambi.  A lot of effort was put into this.Take a look at a 53 minute feature on the making of Bambi that covers the story, characters, actors, art design, music, and history of the film. Among the many interesting things in this feature, you will hear about a wonderful man by the name of Siegmund Salzmann also known as Felix Salten. You will hear how Felix Salten's book that was first published in 1923 in Germany, became a Walt Disney film in 1942.Also, on the DVD you will hear interesting facts about real life forest animals that helped inspire the characters.  Take a look at the virtual forest feature where you can bring sights and sounds of the forest right into your home with great sound and picture. You can browse through about 150 photos, see 2 deleted scenes, watch the original theatrical trailer, take a look at Bambi 2, ""Bambi and the Great Prince of the Forest"" due to come out in the spring of 2006 and more.I like this story because it's full of charm, but also, because it does not sugarcoat the poison.  It's a story full of love, sadness, humor, fear, and even death. It stars some of the most beloved characters of all time. The lovable rabbit Thumper, the adorable little skunk Flower (Flower is my favorite character of all times, he is so cute), the wise Owl, the Great Prince of the Forest, Bambi's loving Mother, the charming Faline, and of course, Bambi himself and the rest of the forest animals. It shows how animals can be effected by the choices we make. About one hundred and thirty-million animals are killed every year in the USA because of hunting, and many that don't die live in fear.Chickens, cows, pigs and other farm animals that are raised in factory farms before they are slaughtered for food in the United States have it even worse. Most of the meat that Americans consume comes from animals living in factory farms. The most abused animals in the USA are those in vivisection labs also known as animal testing. Rats and mice are the most common animals used for testing but they are not the only ones, many other animals are used (sometimes even cats and dogs).  I hope people will make the connection between the animals they love in cartoons to the animals in real life that we share the planet with.

And ill admit it, bambie's mother's death still makes me cry, no matter how many times i see it.  I get so mad tooo because you know that hunter had to see that the doe was with a foul, and shot anyways....how evil can you get?  That's one of the main points in the film, the evil of mankind.

78909,A2SU6CA6HSK85I,0788806270,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","I'm not generally a big fan of Disney movies. However, I know that I saw Bambi as a small child, and I was curious as to whether watching it again would bring back any memories. Plus, the chance to get a sneak peek at an upcoming DVD was too good to miss, and I'm a sucker for anything with skunks in it...For this 2-disc special edition, Disney have apparently spared no expense in restoration. The original 1942 nitrate negatives were taken from the Library of Congress, scanned in high resolution, and literally thousands of hours were spent painstakingly removing scratches and blemishes that could not be repaired automatically. The color was also restored to its original vibrancy, based on the colors from the original artwork.The result is stunning; the movie almost looks like it was made yesterday, except that the animation is far more detailed than we are used to seeing today. The textures have a buttery smoothness to them, like good digital photography, and the characters seem almost three-dimensional. This is even more true in the scenes shot using multi-plane animation, such as when the camera zooms in with astounding realism and sense of depth. During the winter scenes, I found myself watching individual snowflakes tumbling over and over in 3D.Animation is notoriously hard to encode to DVD; MPEG isn't suited to large areas of flat color, and the opening sequences in the mysterious forest must have kept the technicians up at night. Yet I saw no flickering MPEG artifacts in the shadows, no moving noise or grain to spoil the art. The one exception was during a couple of the winter scenes, where I sensed the thick snow and character movement was beginning to push the limits of the compression, and I thought I detected some slight shimmer. Still, overall very impressive.The movie now features a new surround soundtrack, mixed from the original audio masters. For the benefit of purists, there is also an option to hear the restored mono soundtrack. I found the surround mix to be restrained and tastefully done, but I appreciate the option to hear it exactly as it was created 60 years ago. The music is important to ""Bambi"", as important parts of the story are told entirely through the music.The backgrounds are often impressionistic, becoming more minimalist during the fight/flight sequences, so as to emphasize the action, yet always remaining realistic.  The animals look like animals, caricatured just enough to be expressive. The only exception is Flower, the skunk, who I've always felt was stylized a little too much, and is mentioned in the bonus material as the character Walt said they could humanize more. Oh, well...One of the bonus features is a re-enactment of the discussions Walt had with the rest of the production team, as carefully transcribed at the time, presented with the relevant movie clips. It's clear from the discussions that they had high artistic goals for the movie, hoping to tell the story through action rather than dialog, and without showing man.  There are also shots of the animators studying the motion of real animals, sketching actual animal movements they could use in the movie.There's no doubt in my mind that ""Bambi"" deserves its status as one of the true classics of animation.

78911,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,0788806270,Andrew McCaffrey,"[6, 8]","I'm not exactly sure why I received a free copy of this DVD in the mail; this isn't the sort of film I normally buy.  I'm clearly much older than the intended audience, and I have no little rugrats of my own to share this movie with (to be fair though, this is obviously a kids movie that grownups can also enjoy).  In fact (although whatever computer program that decided I should be put on the Disney marketing mailing list wouldn't have known), I've reached my present age without ever having seen the film BAMBI before.  So, for me, this isn't a nostalgic look back at a film I loved as a child.  It isn't a happy reunion with something that thrilled me years ago, something which contains many happy memories.  For me, it was just another film, albeit one with a grand reputation.  But I watched it and enjoyed it; although I'm clearly not seeing it in the same mind-frame that others do.This is a very leisurely and pleasant film.  It's willing to feature slow pans across lovingly painted backdrops of forest rather than quick-cuts and lots of action.  The script is more interested in presenting a mood rather than telling a story, and it's offered in a way that I quite enjoyed.  The characters are simple without coming across as stereotypes.  There's a quote from Walt Disney that reads, ""Until a character becomes a personality, it cannot be believed."" Well, I think he succeeded (my favorite character was the grumpy, bad-tempered, old owl).  I can't say that I adored the film, but I'm glad I spent the time watching it.  It covers a lot of the same ground embraced by other children's stories, but it did so with great confidence and an pure kind of style.In many ways this is a much more innocent movie than what we would expect nowadays.  On the other hand, I was vaguely surprised at how dark portions of it were.  The sections of the film dealing with the encounters between the animals and the humans are, of course, well known (even I knew about Bambi's mother) and well remembered.  And I must admit to being a bit baffled by the sequence in which several female critters hide in the bushes like snipers and one-by-one pick off unsuspecting members of the male animal kingdom for, um, marriage (or whatever).  It's an... old-fashioned view of male-female relationships, I suppose.  A relatively harmless but overwhelmingly male-centric view of the world, I still found it slightly creepy.  It would no doubt be handled differently today, though I suspect there wouldn't feature any actual improvement.  The female skunks and rabbits would probably be having wardrobe malfunctions all over the place to attract their men.The two DVDs contain more than anyone who loves this film would ever want and the set gets an extra star just for all the DVD features.  Not being familiar with the movie, I really wasn't interested in this, although I'm sure that when the list of features was announced a few months ago there were a lot of classic film buffs (and Disney fans) salivating wildly.  However, the one item this film-viewer appreciated more than anything was the digital restoration.  Whether you like the movie or not, you can't help but be impressed by how crisp the picture is, how bright the colors are and how clear the sound is.  It really looks and sounds wonderful.  I suspect for many people, this is what makes the set worth buying.One thing I didn't like about this double-disc set is the advertising all over the place.  It's bad enough having to sit through ads and trailers before you get to the main menu, but the annoyances don't even end there.  I realize I'm watching a ""Disney DVD"" and that it's been restored and that it's digitally optimized for my magic whatsit converter thingie!  Why on Earth do I need to see giant signs with bold letters telling me this before starting the feature?  I must have fast-forwarded though three minutes of boasting.  In addition to the filler on the discs, the DVD case also contains more junk than is necessary.  I can understand them putting in fliers promoting release dates for future DVDs; that makes perfect sense.  But posters?  Magazines?  There's an advertisement for food in here for heaven's sake!In any event, I finally got introduced to one of the most famous and beloved children's movies of all time.  Had it not been sent to me out of the blue, I probably would have spent another few decades without knowing it.  I'm glad I did though.  I liked it, even if I'm not sure I'll ever feel a staggering desire to watch it again.  For people casually interested, at least a rental is in order.  For the hardcore Disney folk however, I suspect this is a must-buy.",4,Humans are bad!,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,4650,"[""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'why', 'received', 'free', 'copy', 'DVD', 'mail', ""n't"", 'sort', 'film', 'normally', 'buy', ""'m"", 'clearly', 'much', 'older', 'intended', 'audience', 'have', 'little', 'rugrats', 'own', 'share', 'movie', 'be', 'fair', 'obviously', 'kids', 'movie', 'grownups', 'can', 'also', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'computer', 'program', 'decided', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'Disney', 'marketing', 'mailing', 'list', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'present', 'age', 'ever', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'BAMBI', 'So', ""n't"", 'nostalgic', 'look', 'back', 'film', 'loved', 'child', ""n't"", 'happy', 'reunion', 'something', 'thrilled', 'years', 'ago', 'something', 'many', 'happy', 'memories', 'was', 'just', 'film', 'one', 'grand', 'reputation', 'watched', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'clearly', 'not', 'seeing', 'same', 'mind-frame', 'others', 'do.This', 'very', 'leisurely', 'pleasant', 'film', 'willing', 'feature', 'slow', 'pans', 'lovingly', 'painted', 'backdrops', 'forest', 'rather', 'quick-cuts', 'lots', 'action', 'script', 'more', 'interested', 'presenting', 'mood', 'rather', 'telling', 'story', 'offered', 'way', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'are', 'simple', 'coming', 'stereotypes', 'quote', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'character', 'personality', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'believed', 'Well', 'think', 'succeeded', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'grumpy', 'bad-tempered', 'old', 'owl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'adored', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'spent', 'time', 'watching', 'lot', 'same', 'ground', 'embraced', 'other', 'children', 'stories', 'did', 'so', 'great', 'confidence', 'pure', 'kind', 'style.In', 'many', 'ways', 'much', 'more', 'innocent', 'movie', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'nowadays', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'vaguely', 'surprised', 'how', 'dark', 'portions', 'were', 'sections', 'film', 'dealing', 'encounters', 'animals', 'humans', 'are', 'course', 'well', 'known', 'even', 'knew', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'well', 'remembered', 'must', 'admit', 'being', 'bit', 'baffled', 'sequence', 'several', 'female', 'critters', 'hide', 'bushes', 'snipers', 'one-by-one', 'pick', 'unsuspecting', 'members', 'male', 'animal', 'kingdom', 'um', 'marriage', 'old-fashioned', 'view', 'male-female', 'relationships', 'suppose', 'relatively', 'harmless', 'overwhelmingly', 'male-centric', 'view', 'world', 'still', 'found', 'slightly', 'would', 'doubt', 'be', 'handled', 'differently', 'today', 'suspect', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'feature', 'actual', 'improvement', 'female', 'skunks', 'rabbits', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'having', 'wardrobe', 'malfunctions', 'place', 'attract', 'men.The', 'two', 'DVDs', 'contain', 'more', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'set', 'extra', 'star', 'just', 'DVD', 'features', 'Not', 'being', 'familiar', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', ""'m"", 'sure', 'when', 'list', 'features', 'was', 'announced', 'few', 'months', 'were', 'lot', 'classic', 'film', 'buffs', 'Disney', 'fans', 'salivating', 'wildly', 'However', 'one', 'item', 'film-viewer', 'appreciated', 'more', 'anything', 'was', 'digital', 'restoration', 'movie', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'impressed', 'how', 'crisp', 'picture', 'how', 'bright', 'colors', 'are', 'how', 'clear', 'sound', 'really', 'wonderful', 'suspect', 'many', 'people', 'set', 'buying.One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'double-disc', 'set', 'advertising', 'place', 'bad', 'enough', 'having', 'sit', 'ads', 'trailers', 'get', 'main', 'menu', 'annoyances', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'end', 'there', 'realize', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'been', 'restored', 'digitally', 'optimized', 'magic', 'whatsit', 'converter', 'thingie', 'Why', 'Earth', 'do', 'need', 'see', 'giant', 'signs', 'bold', 'letters', 'telling', 'starting', 'feature', 'must', 'have', 'fast-forwarded', 'three', 'minutes', 'boasting', 'addition', 'filler', 'discs', 'DVD', 'case', 'also', 'more', 'junk', 'necessary', 'can', 'understand', 'putting', 'fliers', 'promoting', 'release', 'dates', 'future', 'DVDs', 'perfect', 'sense', 'posters', 'Magazines', 'advertisement', 'food', 'here', 'heaven', 'sake', 'event', 'finally', 'got', 'introduced', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'beloved', 'children', 'movies', 'time', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'sent', 'blue', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'spent', 'few', 'decades', 'knowing', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'liked', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'feel', 'staggering', 'desire', 'watch', 'again', 'people', 'casually', 'interested', 'least', 'rental', 'order', 'hardcore', 'Disney', 'folk', 'however', 'suspect', 'must-buy']",N/A

My favourite parts were Deleted Scenes and The Making of Bambi. Bambi was one of the cutest Disney characters in my opinion, and through these 2 parts, I knew how Bambi was created and something I've never known about Bambi. The part which attracted me most was The Legacy Continues, the trailer of ""Bambi-2"". I was excited to see this! If it wasn't for this, I wouldn't know ""Bambi-2"" which was so wonderful would be published! The part which entertained me much was the personality profile game called What's Your Season.

78918,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,0788806270,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 1]","Bambi is one of Walt Disney's most memorable works, and has a powerful message. When I was younger I always remembered being frightened during the song ""Little April Shower"" which starts out calm and cheerful, and then suddenly turns into a terrifying storm. I felt so many emotions through this movie, and that's why it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I could easily say the score is what makes this movie special, and I still get chills when Bambi is desperately seeking to find his mother while all the animals are fleeing. But it's not just the score that makes Bambi special, the animation is incredible and some of the finest animation of all time. The reason the hunter is one of the best Disney villains, is because you never see him. In Bambi humans are the villains, and I remember desperately wanting the creatures to always get away in time, only to be heartbroken when they just couldn't make it. Bambi also has amazing backgrounds, they're not incredibly detailed but they're so effective, and I can imagine being deep in the forests with those characters. That's something new movies don't have, the backgrounds are created digitally. Bambi's backgrounds are painted, darker toned, and a little creepy. Now I've mostly talked about how Bambi is eerie and frightening, but it also has many hilarious moments. One of those moments is when Bambi is on the ice and Thumper is trying to help him up. And it's also very amusing watching Bambi become familiar with his surroundings and when he thinks a butterfly is a bird. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Bambi combines both these elements, humor with terror and I guess that's what makes Bambi so special to me.Now if you see the words platinum edition on a Walt Disney DVD you know it's going to be packed with extras. And let me tell you, Bambi's are incredibly interesting. Sigh...of course there are tons of games and activities which I usually skip but the kids might like them. First off, let me say Bambi is fantastically restored, I used to own the Bambi VHS tape, and I compared both versions on a few scenes. The sound is fantastic, and little specks of dirt and grain have been almost entirely fixed. One of the best features is ""Walt's Story Meetings"", tons of notes were taken from creative meetings and combined together, but instead of letting us read them they're reenacted and the reenactments are top notch. There also is a making of documentary called ""A Prince is Born"" which includes interviews with voice actors and present day Disney artists. Also included are a few short features and two deleted scenes. The original theatrical trailer is also included with this set as well. ""The Old Mill"" a short animated cartoon is also featured on this two disc set.

In this case, the story is ever so familiar, but I seemed to have gotten the sequence wrong. And as with ""Lion King,"" the whole point is the cyclical nature of life. Bambi is an adorable newborn fawn at the beginning, and his twin babies are equally adorable at the end. It's what comes in between that makes the story.You remember Thumper, I'm sure: the little rabbit who is famous for thumping his foot, and who made one of the purely classic lines of my childhood: ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothin' at all."" The little skunk that Bambi calls ""Flower"" because he's only just learning the names of things, and he finds the little skunk in a flower bed. And of course the wise old owl, who explains that ""Nearly everybody gets twitter-pated in the spring."" Indeed.I remembered, of course, that Bambi's mother was killed by hunters, but did not recall that it all happens off-screen. All we impressionable kids got was the sound of the gunshot and then Bambi getting to safety in the thicket, only to discover that his mother had not followed him. But I had somehow connected that with the forest fire, which in fact took place the following spring. It was Bambi's girlfriend, not his mother, who was threatened then, and he successfully fights off a pack of hunting dogs. But the hunters had neglected their campsite, and their cooking fire spread to the entire forest.The story really does have Man as the villain, but I guess that's not too surprising for a story about deer. Disney has done plenty of other stories where humans make friends with forest animals, so I guess he's entitled to this one. And while Smokey the Bear may approve of the forest fire story, to me it was a little too pat how quickly the undergrowth grew back. Still, it is a story for children, after all.

The difference when compared to the VHS is amazing.  Add the features and this 2-disc set is well worth it. The hand-restoration is just gorgeous, it brings the film to life with vibrant color, as it was so long ago on those screens in 1942, but still preserves the spark and innocence of the film as well, even keeping a little bit of 'grainy' feel to it.One can also really appreciate the care and technique of this set due to the fact that Disney has fired all of their 2-d animators, instead relying on computers for animation now.First, when I was viewing the trailer of the movie, I realized that the fight scene between Bambi and the other buck was nearly similar to the animation style of The Lion King, showing its timelessness and influence today.  And of course, there is the birth/circle of life scene influence as well.Anyhow.'Inside Walt Disney's Story Meetings' is a fascinating look at the conception of Bambi.  Disney well-known to act out the entire story for his animators and share with them his vision.  Here, a recording ( with actors ) of the meeting is played and the artwork he is speaking about is shown as the recording plays.  You get to see the process of idea translate to final product and the whole piece is really worth a look.  This is to replace an audio commentary, and includes split-screens and this really is a gem to see, especially for any hard-core animation fan or Disney fan.'Deleted Scenes' contains two sequences that are comprised of storyboards, animated, and pulled from the Disney archives.'Games and Activities' is just that. A collection of games. Each clustered under a season, they range from catching falling objects, to manuvering Thumper off the ice before time runs out.'DisneyPedia' is a segment of real-life nature clips  interspersed with clips from the film, and provides various nature facts and trivia.'What's Your Season' is a personality quiz that lets you take a simple test and determine your 'season' much like other personality quizzes.'Thumper Goes Exploring' is another addition for the children.  It consists of a read-a-long about Thumper.'Virtual Forest' is a segment of a forest animated throughout the seasons.'Making of Bambi: The Prince is Born' is a great documentary that is divided into segments about the construction of the film.  The Lion King parallels are touched on here, as is the importance of story, the loss of life, etc, as well as the revolutionary ( at the time ) animation process, the voice casting, the score, backgrounds, etc.  It employs film clips, interviews, audio, animation and more to be a very interesting piece.'Restoring Bambi' is a look on how the film was hand-restored for DVD from an original print.'The Legacy Continues' is basically a teaser for straight-to-video release of what is essentially Bambi 2.  The film will fill the gap between his relationship with his father and will be out in 2006.'Disney Time Capsule: The Year of Bambi' is a look at the events of 1942, the year the film was released.'The Art of Bambi' is a collection of images, 100s, of storyboards, sketches, concept art, backgrounds, posters, character design, etc. Pretty and worth a look.'Tricks of the Trade' features Walt Disney introducing and explaining the mechanics of the multi-plane camera which was a revolution in animation, allowing the artists/camera operators to split cels into different planes, and achieve better performances with panning scenes - such as Bambi's opener sequence.  It is best to watch this, then the Old Mill or the opening of Bambi, to really appreciate this innovation.'Inside the Disney Archives' features another look into the archives, with cut art and concepts from the movie.'The Old Mill' is a classic cartoon that features the use of the multi-plane camera, and is just fun to watch, being one of the great 'Silly Symphonies' from way back when.'The Original Trailer' is the 1942 technicolor trailer that lured audiences to the film. It shows a great number of clips from the film and is a nice gem to have on DVD, considering its age.All in all, if you're a Disney fan, an animation fan, Bambi's 2 disc set was well worth the wait.  The discs are a treasure trove of things for adults and kids alike, and really provide some great insight into this classic.

Velasquez,"[1, 3]","If you have watched many of Disney's animated movies, you probably know that most of them are about boy loves girl, and that there is usually some evil in-between that does not want boy to marry girl. It's a formula that almost never fails and keeps popping up all the time. ""Bambi"" departs from that storyline and that is the reason why it is so special to me. ""Bambi"" is about real life and its choices, and, for 1942 standards, it was ahead of its time. Happily, this great film is now available on a glorious Blu-ray + DVD edition, and it has never looked better.The film starts with the birth of Bambi, the main character, surrounded by other friendly animals in the forest. We also immediately meet Thumper (the rabbit) and Flower (the skunk), who would become Bambi's lifelong friends and share adventures together. Bambi is destined to be the King of the Forest, like his father, and he learns to be tough early in life, when his mother is killed by hunters. This tragedy sets a point of no return for Bambi, and he has to learn about leadership from his father. Of course, he will also learn about love and about man's brutal effects on nature.""Bambi"" is a must-see for all children. It is not only about cute animated characters, but also about true love for family and friends. It's a powerful early cinematic example of man versus nature, a message that will surely impact your kids in a good, penetrating way. The delightful Blu-ray + DVD Diamond Edition is loaded with extras, such as an introduction by Diane Disney Miller, never-before-seen deleted scenes, deleted song, interactive games, and more.

The clarity and spectrum of color are far beyond all other home video versions of the film, and I'm very satisfied.

I also did not notice any linework disappearing as is common with cartoons blasted with noise reduction, so Disney have clearly taken a more careful approach with these classic titles as to ensure no such loss of integrity.If you get excited over cartoons in hi-def as I do, I'm sure you'll be pleased with this Blu-ray presentation of one of the finest Disney films.

In the classic days, there was usually songs in the background done by a choir or a character in the film but it wouldn't seem instrusive like Aurora in Sleeping Beauty. Bambi looks like a simple film but there's quite a lot going on for it.If the introduction reminds you of the Lion King, this is where those guys got the idea for their film. It starts with the birth of the prince Bambi, a deer who's extremely timid and doesn't have the greatest of balance. He eventually befriends Thumper, a mischievous rabbit and Flower, a really happy skunk(I hate to say gay but you'll see what I mean).From there we explore Bambi as he understands his new world, from knowing the distance between a bird and a butterfly, the slipperyness of ice and other life lessons, including the loss of a loved one. I remember being about 5 watching the scene with Bambi's mother and since her death(as if it's a spoiler at this point) is offscreen, I couldn't understand what happened since as kids, we can't really think outside the box and put 2 and 2 together.It's interesting that when I showed people that I bought this, a lot of them couldn't understand that why I, a big fan of Aliens, Terminator 2 and the Godfather would watch Bambi but really there's 2 things: it is a charming film if you watch it knowing you're watching a Disney film and 2, apparently mothers really find it adorable if you watch these willingly.The one thing as usual I can't stand with Disney and you probably hate this too is the fact that Disney releases a film for awhile then they completely call back the DVD's that didn't sell and keep them. I can't find Beauty and the Beast anywhere and Alice in Wonderland is extremely rare to find.

The film has several light moments, and some have complained about the child-like view taken here. Of course there is a naive, childlike view, as you are watching a baby deer grow up. There are also several dark moments, and parents should watch with thier children to offer support and explanations.This is one of the crown jewels of the Disney legacy, among many, and it has been treated with all the love and respect it deserves. I personally would give it more than five stars if I could. Get and enjoy this rare film.

78950,AWLFVCT9128JV,0788806270,"Dave_42 ""Dave_42""","[16, 16]","Another of Disney's Platinum Editions; ""Bambi"" is certainly a Disney classic, and quite unique in their catalogue.  This is a 2 DVD package, with the first DVD containing the 1942 movie in its original format (1.33:1, the same as a standard television) with an enhanced 5.1 enhanced sound mix (THX certified).  It also contains a feature entitled ""Bambi: Inside Walt's Story Meetings"" where we are able to listen to the comments of those involved in making the film.  It also contains a preview of the second disk.The second DVD is packed with extras as is the case with all of the Platinum Editions.  It includes a couple of deleted scenes (Winter Grass, and Bambi's First Snow), some games and activities for the younger viewers, and a lot of behind the scenes features as well, called Backstage Disney.  These include a making of feature, a restoration features, a sneak peak at the new Bambi movie, a time capsule for 1942, a feature on the multi-plane camera, a feature on the Disney archives, ""The Old Mill"" animated short (in which many of the techniques that were used in ""Bambi"" would be tried), the original trailer, and artwork from the movie.It has been said that ""Bambi"" is the animated feature with the fewest lines of dialogue, and it is amazing how they combined movement and music to effectively tell the story while keeping the dialogue to a minimum.  The movie also is known for its very stylistic or impressionistic backgrounds.  Lastly, as far as I know this is the only Disney movie where the main villain (Man) never appears on the screen.  Instead we see and hear the tools of man, such as gunshots, his hunting dogs, and his campfire which gets out of control and starts a forest fire.The movie was based on the 1923 book of the same name by Felix Salten, although I think it is safe to say that most people now think of the movie when they hear the name.  It premiered in London on August 8th of 1942, in the midst of World War II.  It was the only civilian project which Disney continued during the war years.  The rest of the studio was dedicated to helping the war effort.  Not surprisingly, given the circumstances, the movie lost money in its initial release but has subsequently made millions for the company.The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1943, including Best Music, Original Song (Frank Churchill & Larry Morey), Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (Frank Churchill & Edward H. Plum), and for Best Sound, Recording (C. O. Slyfield).  In 1948 it won a special Golden Globe award for Walt Disney for futhering the influence of the screen with the Hindustani version of the movie.  In 1988 it won the Genesis award for classic feature films.

78951,A8S11VP9Z36D6,0788806270,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[6, 8]","Next toFantasia, Bambi is probably one of the most visually artistic films of the Walt Disney animated library. Each background is a masterpiece that stands on its own, displaying the impressionistic talent of the artists that created them. Rather than being the cartoon-style animals seen inSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the characters from Bambi were rendered after exhaustive study of live animals by the Disney animators. The human emotions that they are given make the final product an endearing combination that is still enjoyable some 70 years later.Bambi, known as ""The Prince of the Forest,"" is seen from birth through adulthood, surround by his friends of the forest, Thumper (a rabbit) & Flower (a skunk). Along the way, Bambi encounters tragedy (this movie can get heavy at times, albeit tastefully done), humor, and love. Interestingly enough, Bambi's love interest, Faline, is voiced by Cammie King, who previously portrayed Scarlett & Rhett's daughter inGone with the Wind. Another interesting fact about the movie is that the hunters/humans themselves, portrayed as the villains in this piece, are only seen in shadow. This definitely increases their menace and contributes to the effectiveness of the story.The picture has been carefully restored with vibrant (yet natural) colors and details that show off the handiwork of the Disney animators; it is almost as if you are looking at the original cels themselves. The sound can be chosen in either 7.1 or 2.0 stereo. Both are great choices, but the 2.0 is probably more for film buffs who prefer to hear the movie to sound as much as it did on its original release.The Good Stuff/Extras:* Disney's Second Screen - Expand the fun by synching your internet-connected computer or iPad with the movie and access additional content. This content includes animated flipbooks, galleries, photos, and trivia. As a note - this technology is not available in all areas.* Disney View - 16x9 full-frame viewing experience that has appropriate (static) artwork to pad out the left and right sides of the screens for those who don't like the black bars.* Intro by Diane Disney Miller, filmed inside the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco* Inside Walt's Story Meetings - I really enjoyed watching this. While viewing the movie, see additional visual material and hear re-created storyboard meetings that let you hear about the inspirations for characters, scenes, and the music. For the animation enthusiast, this is awesome!* Two never-before-seen deleted scenes: titled ""Two Leaves"" and ""Bambi and the Reed,"" they are nice scenes shown in storyboard form, but really would have only slowed the movie down.* Deleted song: not sure if it's the arrangement, but ""Twitterpated"" really sounds much too contemporary to have been included in this movie. Glad it was deleted!* Blu-ray interactive galleries* Game: Disney Big Book of Knowledge* Classic DVD bonus features:*""The Making of Bambi"" lasts for almost an hour, and tells some of the same stories that one hears from the ""Inside Walt's Story Meetings"" extra. Interviews with those actually involved in the film make this a must-see.*Tricks of the Trade: Excerpt from 1957 Disneyland TV show, with Walt explaining the creation of the multi-plane camera, which gave so much depth to his animated movies.*Inside The Disney Archives: Andreas Deja (Supervising Animator at Disney) gives a tour of the archives and shows off some of the rare treasures/artwork.*""The Old Mill"": early Disney Technicolor short and winner of the 1937 Academy Award for Best Short Subject/Cartoon. You can see that this movie was the testing ground for ""Snow White"" and ""Bambi"" in how the animators worked to capture natural movement and nature, as well as the initial use of the multiplane camera.Again, Disney scores high on this very well-done set.",5,Sparkling transfer of this artistic animated classic,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,3834,"['Next', 'toFantasia', 'Bambi', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'artistic', 'films', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'animated', 'library', 'background', 'masterpiece', 'own', 'displaying', 'impressionistic', 'talent', 'artists', 'created', 'Rather', 'being', 'cartoon-style', 'animals', 'seen', 'inSnow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'characters', 'Bambi', 'were', 'rendered', 'exhaustive', 'study', 'live', 'animals', 'Disney', 'animators', 'human', 'emotions', 'are', 'given', 'make', 'final', 'product', 'endearing', 'combination', 'still', 'enjoyable', '70', 'years', 'later.Bambi', 'known', 'Prince', 'Forest', 'seen', 'birth', 'adulthood', 'surround', 'friends', 'forest', 'Thumper', 'rabbit', 'Flower', 'skunk', 'way', 'Bambi', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'heavy', 'times', 'tastefully', 'done', 'humor', 'love', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Bambi', 'love', 'interest', 'Faline', 'voiced', 'Cammie', 'King', 'who', 'previously', 'portrayed', 'Scarlett', 'Rhett', 'daughter', 'inGone', 'Wind', 'interesting', 'fact', 'movie', 'hunters/humans', 'portrayed', 'villains', 'piece', 'are', 'only', 'seen', 'shadow', 'definitely', 'menace', 'contributes', 'effectiveness', 'story.The', 'picture', 'been', 'carefully', 'restored', 'vibrant', 'yet', 'natural', 'colors', 'details', 'show', 'handiwork', 'Disney', 'animators', 'almost', 'are', 'looking', 'original', 'cels', 'sound', 'can', 'be', 'chosen', '7.1', '2.0', 'stereo', 'are', 'great', 'choices', '2.0', 'probably', 'more', 'film', 'buffs', 'who', 'prefer', 'hear', 'movie', 'sound', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'original', 'release.The', 'Good', 'Stuff/Extras', '*', 'Disney', 'Second', 'Screen', 'Expand', 'fun', 'synching', 'internet-connected', 'computer', 'iPad', 'movie', 'access', 'additional', 'content', 'content', 'animated', 'flipbooks', 'galleries', 'photos', 'trivia', 'note', 'technology', 'not', 'available', 'areas', '*', 'Disney', 'View', '16x9', 'full-frame', 'viewing', 'experience', 'appropriate', 'static', 'artwork', 'pad', 'out', 'left', 'right', 'sides', 'screens', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'black', 'bars', '*', 'Intro', 'Diane', 'Disney', 'Miller', 'filmed', 'Disney', 'Family', 'Museum', 'San', 'Francisco*', 'Inside', 'Walt', 'Story', 'Meetings', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'viewing', 'movie', 'see', 'additional', 'visual', 'material', 'hear', 're-created', 'storyboard', 'meetings', 'let', 'hear', 'inspirations', 'characters', 'scenes', 'music', 'animation', 'enthusiast', 'awesome', '*', 'Two', 'never-before-seen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'titled', 'Two', 'Leaves', 'Bambi', 'Reed', 'are', 'nice', 'scenes', 'shown', 'storyboard', 'form', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'slowed', 'movie', 'down', '*', 'Deleted', 'song', 'not', 'sure', 'arrangement', 'Twitterpated', 'really', 'much', 'too', 'contemporary', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'movie', 'Glad', 'was', 'deleted', '*', 'Blu-ray', 'interactive', 'galleries*', 'Game', 'Disney', 'Big', 'Book', 'Knowledge*', 'Classic', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', '*', 'Making', 'Bambi', 'almost', 'hour', 'same', 'stories', 'one', 'hears', 'Inside', 'Walt', 'Story', 'Meetings', 'extra', 'Interviews', 'actually', 'involved', 'film', 'make', 'must-see', '*Tricks', 'Trade', 'Excerpt', '1957', 'Disneyland', 'TV', 'show', 'Walt', 'explaining', 'creation', 'multi-plane', 'camera', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'animated', 'movies', 'Disney', 'Archives', 'Andreas', 'Deja', 'Supervising', 'Animator', 'Disney', 'tour', 'archives', 'off', 'rare', 'treasures/artwork', '*', 'Old', 'Mill', 'early', 'Disney', 'Technicolor', 'short', 'winner', '1937', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Short', 'Subject/Cartoon', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'testing', 'ground', 'Snow', 'White', 'Bambi', 'how', 'animators', 'worked', 'capture', 'natural', 'movement', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'initial', 'use', 'multiplane', 'camera.Again', 'Disney', 'high', 'very', 'well-done', 'set']",N/A

Five years later, the novel would receive its English translation and became an instant hit and a classic.This led to MGM producer and director Sidney Franklin purchasing the rights to a film version of ""Bambi, A Life in the Woods"" in 1933 but because he felt it would be too difficult to make it into a live action film, he sold the rights to Walt Disney in 1937.But Walt Disney was not a healthy company at the time.  ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" were box office flops and it didn't help that the International audience that Disney depended on for revenue was lost due to World War II.  And as for Bambi, as the budget started to reach up to over $800,000, it seemed as if the company would not be able to make their next film.  Fortunately, Walt Disney, who is a wonderful businessman, managed to woo Bank of America in getting the funding for ""Bambi"".While ""Bambi"" would become an instant classic for Disney throughout the last 70-years, back in 1942, the film still faced problems due to World War II and would also lose money in the box office, but it would regain its income in 1947 and would also receive the ire from hunters who felt the film was harsh towards them.But needless to say, ""Bambi"" has come an instant classic in Walt Disney's line of animated films (""Bambi"" is the fifth film from Walt Disney) and it also paved the way for the animation industry as the film would lead to the hiring of Disney's first female animator, the film would utilize multiplane camera technology, would feature an impressionist style courtesy of artist Tyrus ""Ty"" Wong and his artwork of the forests would be groundbreaking for its time and an inspiration for future artists.  Also, the film would feature a lot of paint and colors developed during the making of the film and would eventually lead to newer colors which would be used for future Walt Disney animated films.Also, ""Bambi"" was created on an extreme budget and it was a learning experience for Walt Disney and the studio.As ""Bambi"" has had its DVD release in 1997 (as part of the Masterpiece Collection Version) and in 2007 as a Platinum Edition, the film will receive its 2011 Blu-ray release as a Diamond Edition to celebrate it's 70th year.This new release features a new enhanced digital restoration, newer special features and the use of Disney View and the introduction of Disney's Second Screen technology.VIDEO:""Bambi"" is one of the most wonderful looking animated films that still looks magnificent 70-years-later.  The artwork is highly regarded by artists and although not realistic, you get a feel of a painted style, a brilliant artistic use of paint in animation brought to Disney's attention courtesy of Tyrus Wong.  It was a look that Disney had wanted and amazingly implemented to ""Bambi"" and the overall look of the film is even more impressive on Blu-ray.""Bambi"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1).  The colors are vibrant, the blacks are nice and deep and the character designs and animation look absolutely cute but also its lines are absolute clean.  But it's how the artistic backgrounds and foregrounds compliments the animation is quite amazing!""Bambi"" has never looked this magnificent and I am impressed by how much of an upgrade this film looks compared to its previously awesome Platinum DVD release only four years ago.  There is no compression artifacts, no banding, no scratches or dust, it looks perfect!If you love this film, you definitely need to upgrade to Blu-ray because ""Bambi"" looks fantastic in HD!Because the film is presented in 1:33:1, once again, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings back the ""DisneyView"" featuring the art of Lisa Keene, so instead of the black bars on the side, you can opt for colorful artwork that matches the scenes of the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Bambi: Diamond Edition"" is presented in 7.1 DTS-HD High Resolution Audio, French and Spanish Dolby DEHT  Language Tracks and restored original theatrical soundtrack.  It's important to note that Disney chose to go with High Resolution audio over lossless DTS-HD Master Audio.  But the audio is still fantastic as you can hear the thunder and lightning throughout your surround channels, you can hear Frank Churchill and Edward Plumb's wonderful score and while this film is primarily dialogue and music driven, there ares some scenes where the audio sounds fantastic (primarily the final half hour of the film).The soundtrack is not to immersive, but ""Bambi"" is not an action-driven film. So, the audio is well-utilized when it matters most and its during those more intense, action-based scenes.  Needless to say, this is a wonderful lossless high resolution soundtrack.Subtitles are in English SDH, English ESL, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Bambi: Diamond Edition"" features the following special features:* Bambi: Inside Walt's Story Meetings - A pretty awesome featurette.  It's hard to tell you the duration as my player wouldn't give me the duration time for this feature but because it is featured in a way where you can watch various features separately, you can listen to Walt Disney and staff's audio meetings on ""Bambi"", you can also see two deleted scenes, the making of the film, two bonus animated Disney shorts, anecdotes and more.  The sequence does show picture-in-picture while the film is playing on one side you get to watch this special feature on the other side.  It's clearly one of the best Disney special features I have seen thus far!* Disney's Book of Knowledge - An interactive game based on multiple choice and for players to earn stickers (on-game stickers).* Disney Second/View/What is Disney SecondView - This feature allows people to watch a film on their iPad or laptop and sync it with what they are watching on TV, so you can use the iPad or laptop like a remote but while watching it on screen of your portable device.* Two Leaves - (3:07) An original concept of how Disney and crew were thinking of creating dialogue between two leaves but opted not to use it on ""Bambi"".* Bambi Stuck on a Reed - (1:20) Another concept that was not used for ""Bambi"" but is featured on this Blu-ray.* Twitterpated - (1:53) An explanation of what ""Twitterpated"" is.* Bambi Interactive Galleries - An extensive look at the films sketches, background paintings production pictures, storyboards and visual development.* Deleted Scenes - Featuring two deleted scenes (featured on the original 2007 DVD) - Winter Grass (:56) and Bambi's First Snow (2:31).* The Making of Bambi: A Prince is Born - A wonderful making-of featurette (about an hour long) featured on the original DVD.  This featurettete goes into the art and Disney hiring its first female animator, the hiring of Tyrus Wong, who brought the look and feel of Bambi's artistic backgrounds because he wanted to move up in his job from in-between animation, the music of ""Bambi"", the history of ""Bambi"" and how the book was adapted into an animated film and more.* Tricks of the Trade - (7:18) Walt Disney talks about the multi-plane technology used on ""Bambi"".* Inside the Disney Archives - (8:39) A visit to the vault to look at unused art and sequences from ""Bambi"".* The Old Mill - (8:58) A 1937 Silly Symphonies animated short.* Original Theatrical Trailer - (2:12) The original 1942 theatrical trailer for ""Bambi"".EXTRAS:""Bambi: Diamond Edition"" comes with a Blu-ray slipover case and a DVD fof the film.  The DVD features an introduction by Diane Disney Miller and also includes the enhance edition of ""Walt's Story Meetings"" and DisneyPEdia: Bambi's Forest Friends.  The DVD is presented in 1:33:1 aspect ratio, 5.1 Dolby English, French and Spanish language tracks and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:""Bambi"" is a classic that will continue to entertain generation after generation.It features a wonderful, touching story about family and how they continue to survive in the wild but faces the challenge of man.  Granted, I understand that this film may not satisfy hunters (as many of them were upset by the film during its original release) but for my family, as my wife and I, both have grown up with this film and it was one of the first Disney films that we introduced to our son.We both felt that it was a family film that featured cute characters, innocent characters but also showed the importance of family, listening to rules and of course but also a first step of explaining to them about what was transpiring between Bambi and his mother and what happens later in the film.So, as this film has resonated so strongly for my family, I'm sure it's a film that many other families will love.  Afterall, it has entertained generation after generation for 70-years.And with this film now being released on Blu-ray, I do have to say that this is one of the most beautiful classic animated film from Disney on Blu-ray thus far.  Call me biased but not only is the artwork magnificent, everything about it... from the animation, it's character design, the cast (the voice actors were magnificent and how they used the young voice actor's accidental pauses during the recording and actually using it in the film was brilliant!), its music and the storyline, everything works in harmony.  The nature of the film had a unique style, the use of the multiplane cameras also gave it a distinct look.  I really enjoyed this Blu-ray release!Now, of course, comparing the special features to other animated classics from Disney on Blu-ray, it may seem that ""Bambi"" has less special features.  In the past, the special features were all separated but the way its done on ""Bambi"", they were combined as one full special feature.  So, for example ""Bambi: Inside Walt's Story Meetings"", this may seem like on feature but really, there are about ten special features in that one feature alone.  For ""The Making of Bambi"", there are five special features and of course, the other additional special features, if added, you get a lot included in the ""Bambi: Diamond Edition"".  Granted, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Pinocchio"" are still excellent as they go way beyond what one would expect for special features but this release is still quite solid!Overall, if this 1942 masterpiece resonates strongly with you or you are a Disney fan looking to upgrade to ""Bambi"" in High Definition, you won't be disappointed.  ""Bambi: Diamond Edition"" is another must-own Disney animated classic on Blu-ray and is highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray: A timeless animated classic that Disney fans will definitely want to own on

78963,A11C43I615R52G,0788806270,"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker""","[0, 0]","Bambi is unquestionable a masterpiece. It's one of the best pictures in the Disney catalog and one of the best pictures ever made. It's simple coming-of age story is so pure, so fill with heart and so honest that you can't help but stare in awe throughout its all too brief 70 minutes. Bambi is filled with moments of joy, sadness, danger, courage, love that helps the story be so timeless as it is. A story so excellent as this one is accompanied by some of the best work of animation that have ever come from Disney. The backgrounds are simply amazing and the characters are so well drawn that you have a sense of reality that not many animated films had. A fantastic score is also one of the many great additions that make Bambi the great classic movie that it is. This film represented the end of the golden age period when the five movies released by Disney until that time (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo and Bambi) pushed the boundaries and made animation an art form of unquestionable beauty.Following the excellent BD sets of Snow White and Beauty and the Beast, Bambi is the third movie in the Diamond line and the results are spectacular. Disney is a master in restoring its classic films and Bambi is no exception. The picture is so pure, so clean, so detailed that you will see much more that you ever had before. No artifacts, edge enhacedement and other issues are encountered in the picture. An oustading restoration for an outsatnding film. Likewise, in the audio department, Bambi has been given a new 7.1 Dts-HD HR audio. While this High Resolution audio is not losseless (as the Master Audio), is very effective and I don't think  Bambi could hear any better. Dialogue is crisp and clear and the score sounds magnificently. Also the restored mono soundtrack is included.When I first pre-order this set, I watched in dismay that this Diamond will only have 1 BD instead of two like the other Diamond titles. Well, let me tell you that I don't think there's a need for another one. The first thing that you will encounter in the bonus features department is the new ""Disney Second Screen"". This features syncs the movie with an app in your laptop or ipad and you can watch the movie while additional information appears in the computer. I have to say that this feature is quite entertaining and makes you dive better into the film. The only problem is that the movie goes real fast so you may miss some features but the good news are that you can watch this things on your own without the film (although is not quite as entertaining). Then you have the ""Inside Walt's Story Meetings-Enhanced Edition"". While this feature appeared in the Platinum DVD, this Enhanced mode is way better. As with the Hyperion Studios and Beyond Beauty material in the previous Diamond title, this is a new interactive way to learn more about the making of Bambi. Several actors reenact the parts of Walt and the others involved in the film and you are literally transported in time and is like being in those meetings with them. Simply amazing. Then you also have two new deleted scenes, one newly found song ""Twitterpated (which I think was good it stayed out of the movie) and an interactive art gallery.Carried from the Platinum DVD is the fantastic making-of documentary ""The making of bambi: A Prince is Born"", a excerpt of a Walt Disney TV show where he explains the use of the multi-plane camera, the animated short ""The old Mill"", two deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer. The only things that I miss from the Platimun are the time capsule featurette and promotional art gallery.A DVD is also included with the film in SD. It looks better than the Platinum but nothing compared to the BD.Bambi is a film that should be in every film collection and this Diamond Edition is a perfect way to own it. With an amazing restoration that brings new life to the film and fantastic and inmersive bonus material this is a must-own release for a must-own movie. Bambi is a timeless classic that I wholeheartely recommend to everyone.

(granted, it's usually not a literal history, but it is a history of art.) I lose interest in cartoons in the 1950's, when, due to the expense, backgrounds become just blocks of color and line drawings. But Bambi! What gorgeous backgrounds they created! And this is where the Blu-Ray really shines. The images have a depth and presence which isn't evident in the DVD print.

The film has never looked better, but it is a little light on bonus material, probably due to less material to be found for it. While the film looks fantastic, I will keep my previous Platinum edition because once again Disney has omitted some bonus material that should have made the cut, there isn't anything too important missing, but considering this is a short treatment to begin with they should have included all of it. I also like to compare the two film releases as the older version shows more grain so I can revisit the film the way I remember it from my childhood.One of Disney's more unique animated films shows labor intensive animation marrying realistic and cartoony looking creatures in one film. The backgrounds are also a standout here with beautiful forest settings and lavish artwork galore. They can be marveled at for hours and I doubt will ever see anything like this ever again. The film looks and sounds better than ever on Blu Ray. Disney's first 5 films remain the standout features and all hold a place in the best animated films of all time, not saying that later releases such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast don't hold spots there too, but the first 5 have a certain quality to them that has never been surpassed by the studio.

It lost money, was not well received by critics, even Walt's daughter Diane wasn't too thrilled with the idea of Bambi's mother dying.  (Walt claimed that he was only following the book, however loosely, a first for him as Walt regularly played fast and loose with classic children's literature.  Something his daughter noticed, you've taken liberties before!  Why not now!)  Some critics called this film ""entirely unpleasant.""  Hunters said it was ""an insult to American sportsmen.""Yes, the book by Felix Salten is much better.  And Walt had no problem putting out a cheap rendition of that book and slapping his name on it: Walt Disney's Bambi (that must have been a shock to the poor author who actually created the character!).Still, it is breathtaking to watch decades later, like paintings in motion.  A fabulous score/choir accompanies the great artwork.  Thumper still remains the star of this little masterpiece.  The most frightening scene for me is not the off screen disappearance of Bambi's mother, it's the pheasants hiding in the grass, trying to calm one of their own, as the hunters approach, ""don't' fly!""  The pack of dogs was also horrific to watch as a child and still pack an emotional wallop today.  This film remains an odd mixture of excessive cuteness/silliness (Flower, et cetera), awesome beauty, and coldblooded realism.

Fascinating, even for hard-hearts who can't sit through the film.Walt Disney says ""swell"" a lot and delights in the possibilities of his project.

He says working on ""Fantasia"" attuned him to the power of music in animation. ""You've got to keep the music in mind when you're building it.""Animal anatomy consultant Rico Lebrun urges the group to break out of its ""Snow White"" mindset. ""We want to characture animals as animals, not as humans. Not as though some human was dressed up in a deer suit.""Story man Perce Pearce notes that the mother deer being shot by a hunter is the first death in a Disney picture. ""The whole audience is gonna say, 'Oh, she's going to get up.' But she doesn't."" (Walt: ""Heavy."")The rest of the double-disc set features a dazzling restoration and an appealing suite of extras.

78978,A2EK9JCWSNT95S,0788806270,"F. Strat ""Jack of All Trades""","[3, 3]","Usually, I don't write a review on my opinion of the movie. Usually, I just review the product itself. But I wanted to say a little something. Bambi was never one of my favorite movies growing up. Because of this, I haven't seen this movie in decades. I never even owned it on DVD. Well, times change & I decided that I must collect all of Disney's classic animated features on Blu-ray. So, I had to get Bambi. But am I glad I did. See, I've always been into the art of animation & nobody did it better than the classic Disney artists. And Bambi may be one of the best animated movies of all time. Okay, on to the review.After Disney's stunning release of ""Alice in Wonderland"", I knew that Bambi would have the same care & quality put into it's remastering. And I was right. It's pristine! Not a spot of grain, dust or any kind of particle. The colors are duller than ""Alice"", but of course this is the way the original film was. It's a more natural palette, because that's what the film is about, nature & life & death & rebirth. The sound on the disc is wonderful as well. I don't think I ever noticed the beautiful music before I watched it on Blu-ray. Bottom line, is that this release is perfect, as far as the film is concerned.Let's talk about the extras. There are a few behind the scenes & deleted scenes. Most of these are from the DVD release, which I never owned, so they're new to me. One of the Blu-ray deleted scenes is a song called ""Twitterpated"". Whoever they got to sing the version on this disc is horrible & the song itself is not so good either. Glad it never made the film. Another deleted scene is one from the book. It's about 2 autumn leaves holding on to a branch & having a conversation about life & the unknown afterlife. This deleted scene is semi-animated with a Flash type of animation. The scene itself is a great one, but I'm also glad it didn't make the film. It wouldn't have fit in & probably would have slowed the film down.As usual, with their classic Disney Blu-ray releases, Bambi also has the useless Disney View, which thankfully, you don't have to use. This is where the black side bars can be filled with similar colored paintings, to fill your widescreen TV. The logic behind this is so stupid. For years, we all had 4:3 (square TV's) & when we watched movies that had a different aspect ratio, we watched it with black bars on the top & bottom, in a letterbox format. Sure, people who didn't care about film complained about this & were happy to watch the movie with parts of it chopped off. So, finally, we get widescreen TVs that get rid of, or diminish the black bars. But when watching 4:3 films, we get black bars on the sides. We're not losing any of the film at all & are seeing it at it's regular size. I really can't think why anyone would care that there are black bars on the sides, but apparently, Disney does. So, they fill up the screen, taking away from the film itself. It's my belief that anyone who watches these films with Disney View on should just stop watching movies all together.With Bambi, Disney gives us a new feature called Disney's Second Screen. With this feature you can sync your Apple iPad with your Blu-ray player. While the film plays on both your TV & your iPad, you can play games or read trivia on the movie (I guess). Just another distraction from watching the film itself. Another useless waste of space on the Blu-ray, that maybe 1% of the people who buy this Blu-ray will ever use. I would complain, if the movie itself wasn't perfect.Bottom line, buy it.

78979,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,0788806270,General Breadbasket,"[4, 5]","""Bambi"" is Walt Disney's 1942 animated feature about a young deer's first year of life. There is fun, there is joy, there is sadness and there's love. It was one of the first films my Gran ever saw back when it originally came out, and a favorite of mine when I was little. I loved the golden book too...It's a pretty simple plot, a deer (Bambi) growing up over a year, but thanks to the animation and the score, it feels pretty dramatic. I remember when I was little, having this feeling that there was something signficant and special in the changing of the seasons, and of the growing-up of the animals. Slipping across a frozen pond, eating clover in a meadow, two bucks battling over a mate, a forest fire, the morning chorus of birds it's all made to feel so momentous, and it does actually feel that way. A lot of characters (particularly the birds) are very cute, in that unique way that they were when Walt was still alive. There's a lot of humour out of the cuteness too (the skunk Flower going all red and tumbling backwards when he gets kissed by Ms. Flower, for instance, as well as Thumper the bunny in general.)The version of the film I saw on DVD (the two-disc special edition) has been restored, and I think it looks pretty good. It's colourful and crisp, as is the soundtrack and score. I did actually think to myself, regarding the score, ""this was recorded back in the 1940s, wasn't it?"". It's pretty clear sounding.The special features are nicely done too. There's two ""deleted scenes"" from the winter sequence, which are basically storyboards with audio of the script. There's a ""Walt's Story Meetings"" feature, which is as close as we'll get from getting an audio commentary from Walt Disney himself. Introduced by Patrick Stewart, it's basically the film, mixed with rough drawings and the like passing around, while a dramatization of the transcripts of Walt Disney's meetings are acted out. It's interesting to get a feel for what Walt was aiming for, and it's a unique way they've gone and shown it. There's also a few other making of documentaries on the second disc. There's a sequence of games based around the seasons, where you play Bambi, and the owl (whose a lot friendlier than he is in the film) shows you round to games and puzzles. It's point and click remote control stuff, pretty standard DVD games, though it's very nicely presented. The games in this feature are for kids, and are loosely educational (memory games, counting games, matching games, etc). It's pretty playable, the only problem with it I think is in the flower matching game, where you have to match the colours of the flowers. The owl asks you to find the yellow one, when the ones that are yellow look kind of light green to me. I'd find that a bit frustrating if I was younger, but anyway. There's also a ""DisneyPedia"" mini-documentary on deer.Definitely worth a look for fans of kids films and fans of animation.",5,A Deer Little Film,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,2923,"['Bambi', 'Walt', 'Disney', '1942', 'animated', 'feature', 'young', 'deer', 'first', 'year', 'life', 'fun', 'joy', 'sadness', 'love', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'Gran', 'ever', 'saw', 'back', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'favorite', 'mine', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'loved', 'golden', 'book', 'too', 'pretty', 'simple', 'plot', 'deer', 'Bambi', 'growing', 'up', 'year', 'thanks', 'animation', 'score', 'pretty', 'dramatic', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'having', 'feeling', 'was', 'something', 'signficant', 'special', 'changing', 'seasons', 'growing-up', 'animals', 'Slipping', 'frozen', 'pond', 'eating', 'clover', 'meadow', 'two', 'bucks', 'battling', 'mate', 'forest', 'fire', 'morning', 'chorus', 'birds', 'made', 'feel', 'so', 'momentous', 'actually', 'feel', 'way', 'lot', 'characters', 'particularly', 'birds', 'are', 'very', 'cute', 'unique', 'way', 'were', 'when', 'Walt', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'lot', 'humour', 'cuteness', 'too', 'skunk', 'Flower', 'going', 'red', 'tumbling', 'backwards', 'when', 'kissed', 'Ms', 'Flower', 'instance', 'as', 'well', 'Thumper', 'bunny', 'general', 'version', 'film', 'saw', 'DVD', 'two-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'been', 'restored', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'colourful', 'crisp', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'did', 'actually', 'think', 'regarding', 'score', 'was', 'recorded', 'back', '1940s', 'was', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'clear', 'sounding.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'too', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'winter', 'sequence', 'are', 'basically', 'storyboards', 'audio', 'script', 'Walt', 'Story', 'Meetings', 'feature', 'as', 'close', ""'ll"", 'get', 'getting', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Introduced', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'basically', 'film', 'mixed', 'rough', 'drawings', 'like', 'passing', 'around', 'dramatization', 'transcripts', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'meetings', 'are', 'acted', 'out', 'interesting', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'Walt', 'was', 'aiming', 'unique', 'way', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'shown', 'also', 'few', 'other', 'making', 'documentaries', 'second', 'disc', 'sequence', 'games', 'based', 'seasons', 'where', 'play', 'Bambi', 'owl', 'lot', 'friendlier', 'film', 'round', 'games', 'puzzles', 'point', 'click', 'remote', 'control', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'standard', 'DVD', 'games', 'very', 'nicely', 'presented', 'games', 'feature', 'are', 'kids', 'are', 'loosely', 'educational', 'memory', 'games', 'counting', 'games', 'matching', 'games', 'etc', 'pretty', 'playable', 'only', 'problem', 'think', 'flower', 'matching', 'game', 'where', 'have', 'match', 'colours', 'flowers', 'owl', 'find', 'yellow', 'one', 'when', 'ones', 'are', 'yellow', 'look', 'kind', 'light', 'green', ""'d"", 'find', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'was', 'younger', 'anyway', 'also', 'DisneyPedia', 'mini-documentary', 'deer.Definitely', 'look', 'fans', 'kids', 'films', 'fans', 'animation']",N/A

78984,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,0788806270,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[3, 3]","Sorry for the Police Squad-style gag.The great thing about a great film is its ability to elicit a nostalgic response in addition to taking on a new meaning with each new viewing.Seeing Bambi again after a few years, this time with my own family on the new Diamond Edition, brought back the memories of each time I saw it in the past (this goes back to the 1960s) and how it resonated then and still does now. This is perhaps the closest an animated film comes to being a moving painting, a work of art in motion. Yet, Bambi is even more than that because the effect is more than visual.Bambi has one of the most powerful and imitated musical scores in the film industry. Let's face it, when ""man in in the forest,"" it might as well be Jaws. And while its last two songs are more a part of the 1940s period in which it was first released, the first two, ""Love is a Song"" and ""Little April Shower,"" are masterworks, in their composition and execution.The main observation I took away from seeing Bambi this time around was how much it reminded me of a Hayao Miyazaki film in tone and design. There are many held cels, pausing for emotional effect much like anime, and the environmental theme has had decade-long ramifications. I wonder if the great Japanese animator was inspired by this film in particular.The one aspect of Bambi that was played down over the years has been the voice cast. No voice cast received less credit in a Disney animated feature, as was Walt Disney's plan at the time, because it was felt that knowing the voices detracted from the animated characters (which is arguably true, especially in this age of star voices). But it's nice that the cast has been revealed more recently and can be researched elsewhere, though not so much in the DVD, except for some comments on a bonus feature.The person I would like to bring into the spotlight here is Paula Winslowe, who embodied the warmth and strength of Bambi's mother flawlessly with impeccable diction and remarkable depth in so few lines. It may surprise fans of the golden age radio classic, The Life of Riley, that Ms. Winslowe played the long-suffering yet loving wife, Peg, to William Bendix's Chester A. Riley -- a fine example of her versatility.The new Blu-ray is stunning, as the film itself is, and features a new interactive feature that allows you to access additional material on your laptop while the film plays (along with other new materials). Most but not all of the older bonus material presented on the previous two-disc DVD, but I'm keeping my old one to keep all the features.Props to the people at Walt Disney Home Entertainment for not being completely Blu-ray-centric for those who still cling to standard DVD by including the newly-enhanced ""Inside Walt's Story Meetings"" feature, which replaces Patrick Stewart from the earlier version (another reason to keep the old DVD set) and adds about 26 additional minutes of expert, on camera commentary and a constant stream of supporting visuals that fly by on the screen as the entire film plays.

Also, while I've always been a fan of Fleicher's mid-30's rotoscoping, the multi-plane technique that Walt's studio perfected is both more subtle and impressively realistic.  (On the second disc in this set you will find the 1937 ""silly symphony"" The Old Mill, which is an earlier demonstration of this technology.)Second, I can't imagine a better, more gentle introduction to children about the cycle of life.  The story's simplicity and the naivete of the young characters is still pretty heartgrabbing, even for an aging boomer.  Such innocence!There is also profound sadness in the lateness of the hour regarding the loss of paradise.  Sixty years ago this film warned against the danger of man's encrouchment.

Disney studios released this artistically advanced classic in 1942. It runs just under 70 minutes. Of course everyone remembers, vividly, the traumatic scene when Bambi, the young fawn, loses his mother to a hunter's bullet. This probably marks the place where many of us cried for the first time during a movie. Although this particular sequence is powerful and somewhat heavy, I was comforted by my mom, and remember laughing, soon afterward, as I watched Bambi at play, with rabbit sidekick, Thumper, and skunk friend Flower. Children seem to intuitively understand the depth and range of this story, which runs the gamut from parental love, loss, grief, survival, friendship and loyalty to the balance of nature and the cycle of life.This is one of Disney's most emotive movies - one where the viewer is drawn in by the storyline, and loveable characters, great voice acting, gorgeous visual effects and, of course, the music. Along with the wonderful tale of that first year in Bambi's life, where he learns to live on his own, the impressionist style artistic and orchestral representations of the four seasons are brilliant. Nature's beauty is really captured here. Examining the visuals closely, the detailed depiction of reality, now so common with computer animation, is replaced here by suggestion - of light, color, form, patterns - just like a painting.As with other platinum edition DVD sets, (""Snow White,"" ""Beauty and the Beast""), this set is an assembled mix of restored and digitally re-mastered classic animation with digital extras. Additional commentary from those present during the film's creation, as well as vintage footage has been included also.The second disc contains a veritable plethora of bonus and historical information grouped into three headings: Deleted Scenes, Games & Activities, and Backstage Disney. Backstage Disney is the segment I like best, which includes: ""The Making of Bambi: A Prince is Born;"" ""The Art of Bambi,"" showcasing a large quantity of production and character study stills, color keys, and backgrounds - fabulous artwork; ""Restoring Bambi,"" reveals the enormous amount of work involved in restoring the aging film; as well as ""Tricks of the Trade,"" and ""The Old Mill,"" an animated short.Bambi is a touching film, beautiful to look at and listen to, for children of all ages.

79004,A2GVJ83F092MIS,0788806270,J. Hayes,"[3, 3]","Bambi, released by Disney in 1943, is regarded by many as one of the most beautiful animated features of all time. This is deservingly so, thanks to a wonderful storyline, memorable characters and some of the most stunning animation I have ever seen. The story follows the birth of a deer named Bambi and Bambi's growing up in the forest. He meets many memorable characters like Flower, Thumper and Faline.This dvd release is incredible and in my opinion 1 of the best platinum editions yet. As everyone has stated, the restoration process undergone by Disney has taken the picture quality far beyond what has been seen before. The artwork in the movie, especially the backgrounds, is brilliantly visible while it hasn't changed the feel of the original version. The dvd has an enhanced Disney Home theater mix which sounds great also.Disk 2 of this set is loaded with great extras for the collector/ animation buff. Casual viewers may enjoy but most people don't bother with the extras. They are very interesting and go into detail just how the movie was made, from the concept of the characters to the techniques used to bring them to life. First off, The Making of Bambi is a 53 minute featurette that explains the design of characters, shows how the background art was chosen and characters' voices. Next is Restoring Bambi, an interesting look at how the old original reels underwent the restoration process to create the excellent print on the DVD. Next there is the Disney Time Capsule-1942, which is just a brief featurette on what was happening in the world in 1942. The Art of Bambi contains galleries of wonderful concept art, character sketches and background art that will prove interesting to the artists out there. Tricks of the Trade excerpt has Walt Disney himself explaining how a character sketched on paper comes to life on the screen. As a bonus the excellent Silly Symphony short, The Old Mill, is included and fits nicely with the overall theme of Bambi. The rest of disk 2 are extras for children like The Disneypedia which takes a look at real life animals featured in the movie, The Forest Adventure Game, Virtual Forest, Disney Storytime and a Personality Profile game. Add 2 deleted scenes of animation and an hour-long Inside Walt's Story Meetings(inspired by actual meetings with Walt Disney and the staff working on the project at the time) and you can tell this set is loaded for extras and is well worth the price for fans of the movie.Overall I think that any Disney fan, old or young, will enjoy this movie because it is so much fun but at the same time the characters and story aren't too cartoonish. I had not seen this in 10 years so it is good to finally own it on such a quality dvd set. Kudos to Disney for giving one of its best films the treatment it deserves, and I encourage any fan to buy it immediately.",5,Another Excellent Platinum Edition from Disney,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,2850,"['Bambi', 'released', 'Disney', '1943', 'regarded', 'many', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'animated', 'features', 'time', 'deservingly', 'so', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'storyline', 'memorable', 'characters', 'most', 'stunning', 'animation', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'story', 'birth', 'deer', 'named', 'Bambi', 'Bambi', 'growing', 'up', 'forest', 'many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Flower', 'Thumper', 'Faline.This', 'dvd', 'release', 'incredible', 'opinion', '1', 'best', 'platinum', 'editions', 'yet', 'everyone', 'stated', 'restoration', 'process', 'undergone', 'Disney', 'taken', 'picture', 'quality', 'far', 'what', 'been', 'seen', 'artwork', 'movie', 'especially', 'backgrounds', 'brilliantly', 'visible', ""n't"", 'changed', 'feel', 'original', 'version', 'dvd', 'enhanced', 'Disney', 'Home', 'theater', 'mix', 'great', 'also.Disk', '2', 'set', 'loaded', 'great', 'extras', 'collector/', 'animation', 'buff', 'Casual', 'viewers', 'may', 'enjoy', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'go', 'detail', 'just', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'concept', 'characters', 'techniques', 'used', 'bring', 'life', 'First', 'Making', 'Bambi', '53', 'minute', 'featurette', 'design', 'characters', 'how', 'background', 'art', 'was', 'chosen', 'characters', 'voices', 'Next', 'Restoring', 'Bambi', 'interesting', 'look', 'how', 'old', 'original', 'reels', 'underwent', 'restoration', 'process', 'create', 'excellent', 'print', 'DVD', 'Next', 'Disney', 'Time', 'Capsule-1942', 'just', 'brief', 'featurette', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'world', '1942', 'Art', 'Bambi', 'galleries', 'wonderful', 'concept', 'art', 'character', 'sketches', 'background', 'art', 'will', 'prove', 'interesting', 'artists', 'out', 'there', 'Tricks', 'Trade', 'excerpt', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'explaining', 'how', 'character', 'sketched', 'paper', 'life', 'screen', 'bonus', 'excellent', 'Silly', 'Symphony', 'short', 'Old', 'Mill', 'included', 'fits', 'nicely', 'overall', 'theme', 'Bambi', 'rest', 'disk', '2', 'are', 'extras', 'children', 'Disneypedia', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'animals', 'featured', 'movie', 'Forest', 'Adventure', 'Game', 'Virtual', 'Forest', 'Disney', 'Storytime', 'Personality', 'Profile', 'game', '2', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'animation', 'hour-long', 'Inside', 'Walt', 'Story', 'Meetings', 'inspired', 'actual', 'meetings', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'staff', 'working', 'project', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'set', 'loaded', 'extras', 'well', 'price', 'fans', 'movie.Overall', 'think', 'Disney', 'fan', 'old', 'young', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'cartoonish', 'had', 'not', 'seen', '10', 'years', 'good', 'finally', 'own', 'quality', 'dvd', 'set', 'Kudos', 'Disney', 'giving', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'treatment', 'encourage', 'fan', 'buy', 'immediately']",N/A

79007,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,0788806270,Jim Jr,"[2, 2]","""Bambi"" is, in every respect, a masterpiece, probably the BEST of all Disney features. From the breath takingly beautiful trip through the forest that opens the film (it almost seems to be 3 dimentional - a fantastic example of Disney's multiplane camera) to the image of the solitary, adult Bambi standing on the rock, it is a visual masterpiece.It is amazing how the story is told almost without words. It has the least dialogue of any Disney film. The story is told with wonderful movement and terrific expressions on the characters faces - Bambi's expressions as he discovers the other animals, how he hides behind his mother peeking through her legs at the little girl deer, the expressions on the male and female characters as they go through the mating cycle - too many to list each one.The digital restoration of the film for the DVD release makes it as fresh and vibrant as if it were a brand new film. The animation is flawless.The extras on the second disk are as fascinating as the film. The feature of the voices showing the people as they are today and their telling of making the sound track is terrific. There isn't a boring segment in the extra features.The music is fantastic. Wonderful melodies and lyrics - ""Love Is a Song"" really sets the tone of the picture. ""Little April Shower"" is fun and visually beautiful.The music carries many parts of the film to terrific effect.Much has been written about the death of Bambi's mother, but it is a part of the circle of life that the animals, in fact all of us humans too, go through. It happens in the bleak winter and immediately we are shown rebirth with the coming of spring and new life. It is really a necessary part of the story. (It might be a good idea to prepair very young children for this before they see the film.)It is mentioned in the special features that ""Lion KIng"" has been called ""Bambi in Africa"" as they are very similar in story, but ""Bambi"" so far surpasses ""Lion King"" that there really is no comparison.This special 2 disk release is one not to be missed.

Larsen""","[1, 1]","When I heard that most of Walt Disney's classic films were ""Going back into the Disney Vault,"" I knew that I had to hurry up and try to order a few that I had grown up with.  ""Bambi"" certainly being one of them; I can recall very vividly sitting down in the leaving room and watching it on VHS.  This timeless Disney classic even made its way into my first grade class at one point and the harrowing scene where all the animals in the forest were trying to escape the forest fire set by the evil hunters eventually triggered a discussion about what usually starts forest fires in real life.  All kidding aside, watching this classic film on DVD with a renewed perspective, I can say that even though it's been many years since I've viewed this film, I can still remember key plots in this story very clearly.  Maybe it's because I watched it so many times growing up that you never truly forget such a heartfelt story in the first place.The two-disc DVD set comes with a new special features disc that highlights the incredibly long and arduous process of bringing this timeless tale to life on the big screen.  ""Inside Walt's Story Meetings"" reveals the collaborative work between Walt Disney himself and many other studio executives as actors and current Disney experts narrate the actual conversation that took place more than sixty years ago set against key scenes in the film as they play out on screen.  It's very similar to a director's commentary that would be included in today's blockbuster films.  Another very informative behind the scenes segment is ""Time Capsule: The year of Bambi"".  Hosted by Patrick Stewart renowned for his performances in (Star Trek: The Next Generation, A Christmas Carol and the TV movie mini series Moby Dick.)  Stewart has recently lent his wonderful acting prestige to the new release of ""Bambi 2"" where he plays Bambi's father.  It's nice to see such a wonderful actor like Stewart getting involved in more family friendly film endeavors.  Moving on, Time Capsule examines the era in history where ""Bambi"" found its way into the hearts of millions around the world and provided audiences with an easy momentary escape from the fears and troubles of World War II.  Finally, in ""The Making of Bambi"" we get to meet the surviving actors of the film and learn how they lent their original talents to a movie that would be destined to become a legend.  An interesting fact that I found most insightful was that the former actor who voiced Bambi in the original film later went onto command entire army regiments during his more mature years in adulthood.If you have kids who are dying to watch a great Disney movie or just want to relive a more innocent time of your childhood for nostalgia, ""Bambi"" is definitely worth getting.

It is the story of a deer who loses his mother by a human hunter; it is also a story about rebirth and spring.  It is a story about furry animals and a story about man as the most terrible of the beasts.But it is also about all life; it is about love & loss, play & responsibility, time & open spaces, friendship & niches, wonder & sacrifice, wisdom & folly, courage & fear, conflict & beauty.I will offer a few snippets: When the great prince first warns the other deer that man is approaching, the other deer turn as the color of autumn leaves as they flee in terror.  When Bambi defends his mate from the advances of a rival deer, he fights for the first time, and the fighting deer become silhouettes against flashes of color.  He fights for the second time to defend the same mate--from black hunting dogs.  Then Bambi and the great prince become as colored leaves as they try to flee the forest man has set on fire.The film seems like an anthropomorphism, but it entails the decisive irony of never showing human beings--even though they are involved and part of the story.  The anthropomorphism is only apparent, for Bambi retains his original mute innocence and his connection to his childhood, even though he loses his mother; Bambi met his mate as a fawn at his mother's prodding as they were frolicking on the meadow; it is on the same meadow that Bambi's mother will later get shot; it is on the same meadow that Bambi will know the ecstasy of seeing again his childhood friend as a young stag.  He struggles against man but in the same sense that he struggles against a rival deer who only pushes and shoves.  Man is mute--but he is a part of nature, too.Yet all of nature celebrates the deer that lives the longest, as a prince, because of the basic gentleness of the deer; it is as a crescendo in a symphony where there is symbiosis as well as dissonance.  In learning to speak, Bambi mistakenly calls a little skunk ""flower""--a name that sticks.  According to the project notes for Bambi, nicely read out while showing sketches and clips as part of this 2 DVD release, the skunk is the only character given anthropomorphic license; the others are intended as poetic portrayals only of true animal characteristics.As the skunk explains, ""all us flowers sleep in the winter;"" man, in hibernation, merely awaits his Spring.This is a beautiful, beautiful film.

I always knew about it, but it wasn't a film that I was compelled to see.  As far as Disney goes, I was more of an ""Old Yeller"" and ""Song Of The South"" kid.  No matter now, because I bought this classic title for the enjoyment of my daughter, who will turn four in a few months, and I watched it with her.My daughter really enjoyed this movie.  It is short, well-paced for children and is crawling with cuddly characters like Thumper, Flower, and every other small woodland creature that makes you feel warm inside.  It follows the lifecycle of a newborn deer and his eventual growth into a leader of the forest.  If you haven't figured it out yet, that deer is Bambi.  We see him face the trials of being little and clumsy.  He experiences the loss of a loved one, is taken under his father's wing, and eventually falls in love and has a family of his own.  In a nutshell, this simple flick is a reflection on the human life.The DVD is pretty good.  It has the token Disney advertisements that everyone seems to hate.  For some reason, my DVD player has no problem skipping these features and heading right to the title menu of the film.  It seems that others have a problem with this.  Anyway, I watched many of the advertisements this time around and I wasn't bothered by them at all.  I haven't paid much attention to the extra features on the second disc, because I buy DVDs primarily for the film on them.  If a feature catches my eye, though, I'll watch it.This movie does drag a little bit for older audiences.  Since this was my first time viewing this film, I had no memories to fall back on.  I still enjoyed the film, but I think that it is definitely a bigger hit with young children.Get this DVD if it brings back fond memories for you or if you want those memories for your own family.

79026,A6ADO7B6FUVN,0788806270,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 11]","In a historical perspective Bambi is a powerful film, as it was released in the middle of World War II when the Germans and Japanese still were going strong on their invasion of the World.  Many lives were lost on both sides during the war, as families were shattered and children would never again hear their fathers read a bedtime story.  Death spread its darkness throughout Europe and Asia while in America death only came through a messenger.  People feared the sound of unexpected door knocks, which could be the messenger of sorrow and grief.  It was a time when mankind once again lost its innocence, as war, famine, disease, and other horrors haunted mankind. In this time Disney released its animated coming of age tale of a deer named Bambi.Bambi seems to function as an allegorical example of the war that the world faced through the depiction of the wildlife, as the animalistic characters faced troubles and happiness.  However, the film keeps an innocent perspective on the difficulties that Bambi confronts.  The story opens with scenes of a mysterious forest where things seem to continue without any consideration of what is going on in the world.  Consequently, the audience is brought to Bambi who recently was born, as he struggles to gain control of his legs while many animals are present to witness his first wobbly steps.  Bambi is clean and so it the spot where he was born, nothing is there to remind the audience of the difficulty of birth.  This is an example of the story's illustrated innocence.Curious Bambi begins to observe and learn about the world through his buddy Thumper, a caring rabbit, which brings him on small adventure in the neighboring area.  Nourishing friendship helps Bambi to say his first word, burd, which was supposed to be bird.  Adorably the tale tells about Bambi's development, as his talk and walk steadily is improving.  Eventually, Bambi's mother educates him about the dangers in the world, as she brings him to the meadow.  This becomes Bambi's first lesson in being careful since danger might be lurking around the next corner.The innocence even exists when Bambi loses his mother, as it only displays an escape followed by a gunshot sound.  Innately the audience will know what happened, as the sound will cue the viewers' consciousness in the direction of death.  However, death is never truly dealt with by more than a couple of shed tears by Bambi, as big buck comes along and tells him it is time to go.  The fragile moment of Bambi's loss could have been elaborated, however, Disney decided to tell a happy tale full of hope.  This was probably something that was necessary in the time of war, as death was plentiful in the reels shown before the feature films in the theater in the 1940s.Instead of telling a story of the troubles that Bambi faces the film illustrates a tale of optimism and perseverance, as life will go on.  The continued existence of Bambi shows that he is coming of age, as he later appears as a young buck with good morals and strong values.  These values are depicted when another young buck threatens his first love.In the shadow of the war children and adults could seek the sheltering darkness of the film where they could escape horrors for a few minutes by watching Bambi.  The people could later leave the theater encouraged and motivated that good things will happen.  This was essential in troubled times such as during 1942 when war was burning in Europe and Asia.  Disney brought this cinematic experience to the audience with a delicate touch without alarming, or spreading more fear into the audience, but rather empowering them, and leaving them with a positive experience that could mean a world of difference.  Today the film still has this empowerment over the audience, as Bambi learns how to stand on his own four legs.",4,Historically Powerful and Visually Brilliant Animated Film!,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,3831,"['historical', 'perspective', 'Bambi', 'powerful', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'middle', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'Germans', 'Japanese', 'still', 'were', 'going', 'strong', 'invasion', 'World', 'Many', 'lives', 'were', 'lost', 'sides', 'war', 'families', 'were', 'shattered', 'children', 'would', 'never', 'again', 'hear', 'fathers', 'read', 'bedtime', 'story', 'Death', 'spread', 'darkness', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'America', 'death', 'only', 'came', 'messenger', 'People', 'feared', 'sound', 'unexpected', 'door', 'knocks', 'could', 'be', 'messenger', 'sorrow', 'grief', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'mankind', 'once', 'again', 'lost', 'innocence', 'war', 'famine', 'disease', 'other', 'horrors', 'haunted', 'mankind', 'time', 'Disney', 'released', 'animated', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'deer', 'named', 'Bambi.Bambi', 'function', 'allegorical', 'example', 'war', 'world', 'faced', 'depiction', 'wildlife', 'animalistic', 'characters', 'faced', 'troubles', 'happiness', 'However', 'film', 'innocent', 'perspective', 'difficulties', 'Bambi', 'confronts', 'story', 'scenes', 'mysterious', 'forest', 'where', 'things', 'seem', 'continue', 'consideration', 'what', 'going', 'world', 'Consequently', 'audience', 'brought', 'Bambi', 'who', 'recently', 'was', 'born', 'gain', 'control', 'legs', 'many', 'animals', 'are', 'present', 'witness', 'first', 'wobbly', 'steps', 'Bambi', 'clean', 'so', 'spot', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'nothing', 'there', 'remind', 'audience', 'difficulty', 'birth', 'example', 'story', 'illustrated', 'innocence.Curious', 'Bambi', 'observe', 'learn', 'world', 'buddy', 'Thumper', 'caring', 'rabbit', 'small', 'adventure', 'neighboring', 'area', 'Nourishing', 'friendship', 'Bambi', 'say', 'first', 'word', 'burd', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'bird', 'Adorably', 'tale', 'Bambi', 'development', 'talk', 'walk', 'steadily', 'improving', 'Eventually', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'dangers', 'world', 'meadow', 'Bambi', 'first', 'lesson', 'being', 'careful', 'danger', 'might', 'be', 'lurking', 'next', 'corner.The', 'innocence', 'even', 'when', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'only', 'escape', 'followed', 'gunshot', 'sound', 'Innately', 'audience', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'sound', 'will', 'cue', 'viewers', 'consciousness', 'direction', 'death', 'However', 'death', 'never', 'truly', 'dealt', 'more', 'couple', 'shed', 'tears', 'Bambi', 'big', 'buck', 'along', 'time', 'go', 'fragile', 'moment', 'Bambi', 'loss', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'elaborated', 'however', 'Disney', 'decided', 'tell', 'happy', 'tale', 'full', 'hope', 'was', 'probably', 'something', 'was', 'necessary', 'time', 'war', 'death', 'was', 'plentiful', 'reels', 'shown', 'feature', 'films', 'theater', '1940s.Instead', 'telling', 'story', 'troubles', 'Bambi', 'film', 'tale', 'optimism', 'perseverance', 'life', 'will', 'go', 'continued', 'existence', 'Bambi', 'coming', 'age', 'later', 'young', 'buck', 'good', 'morals', 'strong', 'values', 'values', 'are', 'depicted', 'when', 'young', 'buck', 'first', 'shadow', 'war', 'children', 'adults', 'could', 'seek', 'sheltering', 'darkness', 'film', 'where', 'could', 'escape', 'horrors', 'few', 'minutes', 'watching', 'Bambi', 'people', 'could', 'later', 'leave', 'theater', 'encouraged', 'motivated', 'good', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'was', 'essential', 'troubled', 'times', 'such', '1942', 'when', 'war', 'was', 'burning', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Disney', 'brought', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'audience', 'delicate', 'touch', 'alarming', 'spreading', 'more', 'fear', 'audience', 'rather', 'empowering', 'leaving', 'positive', 'experience', 'could', 'mean', 'world', 'difference', 'Today', 'film', 'still', 'empowerment', 'audience', 'Bambi', 'how', 'stand', 'own', 'four', 'legs']",N/A

""Bambi"" is a tale that is for children.  However, that tale contains every element present in the life of a typical child: friendship, love, parental protection, loss, fear of the unknown, and, of course, growing up.  I am still astonished at how a film that clocks in at 69 minutes can capture the essence of life.""Bambi"" is born into the world of the forest.  Everyone calls him a prince.  Bambi learns quickly that his world is full of friends, but he also soon learns that portions of the world are scary and unknown, with the scariest thing of all, the creature we never see, man.  ""Bambi"" alternates between humor and fear, and yet, the theme of the movie is that all these things are a part of life.Of course, we know that in the end Bambi will overcome, giving children and adults everywhere a message of hope.  No matter the traumas that we face in life, we have the ability to persevere.  We have the ability to change our world.  We have the ability to love and hope.  We too can be Bambi.Few movies can touch ""Bambi"" in the skill of animation and direction.  The plotting is phenomenally focused and fast-paced.

With gaps of twelve months between all previous Platinum Editions this will be released in Easter 2005 a scant six months after Aladdin. Six months after this we'll be getting Cinderella.Hopefully this does not mean a dip in quality. With a whole year to work on each of these, they have all been very special packages. Shortening the time between releases may also mean a dilution of the 'specialness' (if such a word exists) of their arrival - I for one look forward to October for their release. Another point is that there is a finite number of Disney films worthy of the Platinum Edition treatment and, since the studio seems to have all but given up trying to produce new 'classics', I'd hate to see them use all of their valuable commodities too quickly - the best things come to those who wait.The film is an obvious classic. Beautifully crafted, it may seem twee to a certain age group (those too old to enjoy 'funny animals' and too young to appreciate a good thing) but it, like it's contemporary The Wizard of Oz, rewards the older viewer with a seemingly childish tale hiding a deep and powerful story.

79054,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0788806270,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 5]","I remember well that when I was a young boy one of the first feature length films I saw was Walt Disney's Bambi. I remember how upset I was over the death of Bambi's mother-I still am upset when I think about it-and I also remember how happy I was when Bambi went on and lived his life afterwards. The movie had a profound emotional impact on me and I cannot tell you how thrilled I am that Disney restored this classic and packaged it as a two DVD set with numerous valuable and informative extras.Of course, the film tells the story of Bambi, a young deer, over the course of one year. (No spoilers here, the events I am about to mention are all well known and they are discussed in a few other reviews already posted here as well.) At first, his life is completely happy as he is a child-but then Bambi is suddenly rendered an orphan when his mother dies. We feel sorry for Bambi and there is this image of his mother's face just afterwards that pulls TREMENDOUSLY on your heartstrings. The narration of how Bambi won't see his mother ever again adds even more to one of what is certainly the most emotional moments in all if film history. (Note the statement the film makes about the threats of mankind interfering with Mother Nature. This still holds true today.) The film then goes on to show Bambi (the young prince of the forest) making new friends-a rabbit named Thumper and a skunk named Flower. The issues that go with friendship are dealt with during Bambi's growth into adulthood: becoming more independent, self confident, vulnerable yet ready to explore something more than friendship-a romantic relationship with Faline, a female deer. Bambi eventually becomes a leader in the forest! As you can see, the natural cycle of life is introduced to children as gently as possible as well. (In order to avoid spoilers I'll stop the plot details here.) The movie is only 69 minutes long but the plot and the pace hold your attention very, very well and the lines are well executed. In addition, look also for the horrific forest fire scene, again caused by man's careless attitude toward nature; and the scenes where springtime comes and all the younger animals become ""twitterpated.""I know I am now dating myself, but look for Sterling Holloway as the voice of a flower! GRINI cannot do justice to this two DVD set without telling you about the multitude of extras you're going to get as a reward for buying this painstakingly restored masterpiece of a film! The first DVD has an incredible plus called Inside Walt's Story Meetings. Here you can see the film and alongside it are script notes and Walt himself with the animation team planning the picture. DVD two has by far the lion's share of the extras. One of the best is entitled Restoring Bambi. This tells the story of how they painstakingly restored the film, cleaning it up and polishing it to remove the wear and tear of time. When this was first released in 1942 the original negative was filmed on Nitrate film stock; and this is highly unstable to say the least. (It is actually flammable, too.) They had to cart the whole set of reels from The Library of Congress by refrigerated truck and restore the film using a color wheel and a black and white negative (yes, a black and white original negative) of the movie. It worked, much to their credit!!! Want to see an example of the difference for yourself? Look at the restored film on disc one and then look at the unpolished original theatrical trailer on disc two. You'll notice the difference and be awestruck by Disney's hard work! Much work was done to bring back the sound to its former brilliance as well. In an extra called DisneyPedia: Bambi's Forest Friends we learn about deer in the wild. Then there's ""Tricks of the Trade"" about animation technique filmed in 1957 and hosted by Walt himself. There are also two deleted scenes and a teaser about the future of Bambi-will they release Bambi Part Two? You get a screensaver for your computer and then there's The Old Mill animated short which won the 1937 Oscar for Best Short Subject!In short, there is just no way that this movie can be skipped--especially in this two DVD set package if you're an art or movie collector, a parent of a young child, or a Disney fan. It was an historic production in its day and it still retains its significance. Although modern computer animation is completely wonderful, there is nevertheless still something enchanting and romantic about the painstaking old fashioned animation methods used to create this masterpiece.",5,YES!

The story tells of a baby deer named Bambi who loses his mother to a hunter and is brought up by his father, the Great Prince of the Forest. An adult Bambi falls in love with Faline who is a female deer and has to fight for her against a male deer. At the end of the movie Faline has twins and Bambi is standing next to his father overlooking the forest. Basically that is the cliff note version of the movie. The movie itself is less then a thousand words and in any scene there is not that much dialogue.In the two disc DVD set there are some interesting tidbits. I the first disc you get to hear the story meeting that went on about making Bambi; I don't know if they are the real voices or just actors. Walt Disney sounds like Walter Cronkite. In disc two the most important one is the Backstage Disney and you learn story behind Bambi. One thing the bunny Thumper was not in the original book but was added in midway into the development of the film for comic relief. This is the first and only animated Disney where a non villain is killed in the movie. Due to World War II and other reasons Bambi lost money in the theaters and thus the next six films were the infamous package films. This is the first Disney film where all the songs are sung off screen and not by the characters themselves. Bambi was nominated for three Academy Awards for Original Song, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, and Best Sound, Recording. There are more interesting facts in this two disc DVD set.

The animation, art, music, voicing, and storytelling that comprise this 1942 feature are nothing less than brilliant and magical, and it is highly recommended that the interested viewer take in all the behind the scenes features to get the full depth of what went into its making. Every single frame of this masterpiece was as painstakingly developed by Walt and Co. as it was recently restored for this superb DVD release. The expertly reenacted storyboard meetings comprising the magnificent film commentary (found on the DVD as ""Bambi: Inside Walt's Story Meetings"") are proof of that. In fact, all the behind the scenes extras offer great insight into the creation of this work of art, including the huge contributions of Disney artist Tyrus Wong, the level of attachment Walt had to Salten's original book, and the importance music played in the telling of a story of few words. This new platinum DVD is stunning! Not just the wonderfully done restoration job on the film or that fantastically composed commentary I mentioned a moment ago, but also the art galleries (thanks for the new slideshow option!), the trailer, the DisneyPedia offering, the deleted scenes and behind the scenes programming, the look back at 1942 (bringing to mind how timely certain aspects of the story were), games for the little ones, the classic Disney Silly Symphony ""The Old Mill,"" and a sneak peek at the upcoming sequel, ""Bambi and the Great Prince of the Forest."" In fact, a few of the extras on this DVD were hosted by Patrick Stewart, of ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" fame,  who will play Bambi's father in that upcoming sequel. Yes, it's another frowned upon Disney direct-to-video sequel, but this one looks VERY good, so I've got my fingers crossed. They haven't all been misses, and since Disney's current top 2D-animation legends have been relegated to these direct to video sequels, they will most likely only improve. It's just a shame that the talents behind the Disney Renaissance aren't being allowed to produce for the big screen market anymore.Needless to say, Bambi is a must own for Disney fanatics, animation lovers, parents, filmmakers, and just about everybody with a DVD player, basically. Everyone who's seen the film has favorite moments that evoke a variety of emotions, from the heart-wrenching death of Bambi's mother, to the beloved scenes of Bambi and his friends on ice or becoming ""twitterpated"" young adults! Its beautiful and honest storytelling has stood the test of time.

Doyle ""film buff""","[1, 1]","From the opening scene where the multiplane camera glides through a quiet forest until the stirring forest fire climax, a viewer has to be aware he is watching one of the all-time great films. So much of the cycle of life is covered that it's hard to realize the film is a mere 69 minutes. In a book called 'The Making of Bambi', Ollie Johnston reveals that originally there was much more footage that Disney eventually trimmed, cutting out whole sequences before the film previewed. Obviously, he made a wise decision.There is no extraneous scene here, it moves seamlessly through its cycle of life story with the charming animal creatures carrying the story to its logical conclusion. The background music complements all of the drama and comedy. The storm sequence is the most beautiful blend of music and drawings ever achieved by the Disney artists. The naturally drawn deer are the result of months of careful preparation and study, giving the entire film the feel of a nature study as well as giving the audience great entertainment.The choral work is extremely effective, particularly on songs like 'Love Is A Song' (Oscar nominated), 'I Bring You A Song' and 'Little April Shower'. The impressionistic forest glows with a life of its own and is the real star of the film, thanks to the influence of Japanese artist Tyrus Wong. No wonder this was Disney's favorite film. It will stay fresh and young forever. An awesome achievement!In conclusion, having done some choral work myself as a glee club singer, I especially appreciated the great contribution made by the mixed chorus (male/female) that does such a wonderful job on all of the choruses that blend so seamlessly with the rich background score.

No big Hollywood stars doing voicework.However, in my opinion, BAMBI is one of the most beautiful motion pictures I have ever seen.  The stunning backgrounds manage to look both realistic and like wonderful watercolor and oil paintings.

Now, you can disagree with me, because I am comparing this to the Platinum Edition of ""Snow White"" (which was the first Platinum Edition of its series, so you can tell that Disney put more work into ""Snow White"" than ""Bambi""). The colors weren't as bright and upbeat, where as ""Snow White""'s color was amazing!

The main theme of the film is innocence, and it details the early years in the life of a young deer.

We see Bambi learn how to walk and talk, always with the help of his friends. Like any youngster, he's curious about his surroundings. The film is full of scenes in which he discovers new things and learns how to interact with his environment.The one scar on the film's beauty is the death of Bambi's mother. It happens offscreen, but it's obviously something which could disturb small children. In fact, I know a few adults who won't watch it because of that event.

79120,A31ACI0E88ORDE,0788806270,The Great White Father,"[0, 1]","Ever since I was little, this was my favorite Disney animated feature.  I think the reason is that I could identify with Bambi so much--he knows little more about anything going on than we the audience do--especially if we are very young children who don't even know about life, much less about life in the forest.The one word I can think of to best describe this film is &#34;balletic&#34;.  I've seen so many stage musicals based on Disney, but I think the best stage adaptation of this would be a ballet, utilizing the film score, rather than songs per se.  There are in fact only four songs, and it almost sounds like the forest itself is singing, since the animals aren't, and since there's no &#34;showstopping numbers&#34; going on here--such would profane this film.  Indeed, even the dialogue is minimal--so are the plot and characters--and yet it WORKS.  It's almost like an animated documentary about the animals.One particularly impressive thing is that they managed to make the animals look like real animals and yet give expression to the (in reality) mask-like faces of the animals--and all without it looking anything but natural.  That's not easy to do!  They worked on this for five years, and it shows.  This is a labor of love in all respects: animation, music, the use of silence (at least, no dialogue), etc.  It shows that Disney wasn't always what it is now--they were once capable of making true lofty beauty.One thing that puzzles me, though, is why the heck did Disney choose such SAD stories to adapt--so DARK and heavy-handed?  While it's true that Bambi's mother is killed in the book, it's almost glossed over there what with all the other depressing things that go on.  I read the book once and felt literally choked up by the end--even though Bambi is alive and the new Great Prince, it felt like a tragedy!Otherwise, the only real problem that I can think of is the &#34;mood whiplash&#34; from Bambi's mother being killed to &#34;Let's Sing a Gay Little Spring Song&#34;.  But perhaps that needn't have happened if they'd managed to put in the 12 minutes they were planning to do for this film but were prevented because of World War II.  It would have been nice to know what that would have been like, but now we'll never know.  Personally I think Disney should NOT have made &#34;Bambi II&#34; but should instead have done a 12-minute short based on what they were going to put in this first film, and had that be a &#34;bonus feature&#34; on the DVD.  &#34;Bambi II&#34; just feels too stretched for what's in it, and even taking that into account it's so short!I feel like I would profane this film if I said too much about it.  This is what animation was made for, and this is what I wish Disney and others in America would do again.

79125,A3M2WW0PO34B94,0788806270,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 8]","From the first few moments of the new DVD of ""Bambi"", as the camera weaves through a forest, you realize you are in for a treat.Recently, on another Disney DVD, they had a documentary about the camera that Disney Studios created to achieve this shot. It contained different levels of glass on which the various parts of the forest were painted. The levels of glass could move up and down, side to side, giving the illusion of a camera panning through an actual forest, weaving between trees.This shot is simply remarkable. On the DVD, it is also restored, giving the shot the illusion of a photograph.As the camera moves into the thicket, all of the other forest creatures are excited. The new Prince has been born. Soon, we see Bambi, a new fawn, sleeping at his mother's side. As the other animals approach, Bambi wakes up and tries to stand on his wobbly legs. As he grows, he meets Thumper, a rabbit, and Flower, a skunk and they have all manner of adventures together.""Bambi"", originally released in 1942, is one of the Classics that Disney himself worked on. It is a beautiful film to watch. All of the backgrounds were rendered by hand and some appear to be so lifelike they can pass for photographs. Because the film was restored for this DVD, these pictures are bright and clear, and might have been animated yesterday.Yes, animated films have a reputation of hordes of talking, fuzzy animals, and that certainly holds true in ""Bambi"". What is refreshing here is that the characters aren't annoyingly cute. Also, the film is balanced nicely with scenes of darkness and menace. For every cutesy scene, there is a scene of Bambi and his mother walking through the winter landscape looking for food. For every scene of twitterpation, there is a scene of Bambi and his mother running from hunters.""Bambi"" is not a perfect film, but it comes close. My one complaint is that the film appears more episodic than Disney's other classics. This is partially mandates by the story. The film follows the course of Bambi's life from one season to the next. But the film appears more episodic than necessary because each season is broken up by a short piece depicting leaves falling, snow melting, etc.""Bambi: The Collector's Edition"" follows a long line of high quality, fun and informative Disney DVDs. The Disney DVDs of the classic films are truly encyclopedias on disc. They always contain the absolute best quality of sight and sound, using the best quality print they can find. Often, they have restored the print. They also contain tons of archival footage. Perhaps the stand out in the ""Bambi"" package is called ""Inside Walt's Story Meetings"", a new documentary hosted by Patrick Stewart (more on him later). While preparing this DVD, they found transcripts of the story meetings during the making of this film and have created a new documentary out of this material. Can any aspiring or working filmmaker not watch this? This is fascinating stuff that will surely educate anyone with an inkling to learn more about film. Disc Two contains a lot of other archival material and Making Of stuff.Previous Disney DVDs have been organized in a way that seems to fit. The film and the `family friendly' material were on Disc One. The more educational and archival material were on Disc Two. In ""Bambi"", they have not used this formula. The film and ""Inside Walt's Story Meetings"" are on Disc One. The other archival material and `family friendly' games and material are on Disc Two. I am not sure why they changed this, but it seems odd.Disney is a company that has a well-built marketing machine. Just about everything is made or released with some other promotion or goal in mind. ""Bambi"" is being released on DVD to generate revenue for the company, but also to promote the new Direct to DVD film ""Bambi and The Prince of The Forest"". Of course, there is a preview for the new film on the disc. It appears that the story of the new film is an elaboration of a brief sequence in the original. The new film depicts the relationship of Bambi and his father (Patrick Stewart) after the tragic events in the original film, but before Bambi grows up. From the few scenes in the trailer, they have captured Bambi, Thumper and Flower well, but the backgrounds appear stale and two-dimensional.""Bambi: The Collector's Edition"" is a definite must have. If you have kids, you need to expose them to what quality animation looks like. If you are an aspiring filmmaker, you need to have access to the encyclopedia of information contained on the two DVDs.

Fuller,"[11, 17]","It's been critisized by some for its use of violence in depicting a natural wildfire which causes the death of Bambi's mother (not easy to explain to young children); and its been critisized by others as being &quot;anti-human', or man, for its depiction of the hunting scene where animals are being shot at, including Bambi, who is himself wounded by a hunter.  Yet, &quot;Bambi&quot; has come to represent the gentler side of Disney.  For what it's worth, after the release of &quot;Bambi&quot;, in 1942, Walt Disney began a long and fascinating affair with nature, and ultimately produced many fine nature documentaries, and nature themed films, none of which may have come to fruition without &quot;Bambi&quot;.  With hardly any words spoken throughout its entirety, &quot;Bambi&quot; relies heavily on its breathtaking scenery, and wide range of color to depict the landscape.  The forest looks almost lifelike; and the fire is almost too real.In the opening scene of &quot;Bambi&quot; it is springtime, the beginning of new life.  Bambi is born.  During his first days, Bambi's mother teaches him such things as how to walk.  He makes friends as well; Thumper, a rabbit, and Flower, a skunk.  They also help teach Bambi the ways of the forest.When Bambi is first exposed to a meadow, his mother tells him it is a wonderful place, but he needs to remain cautious.  Later, he finds out why, when man enters, causing all the deer to scramble for saftey in a frenzied flight.  So now Bambi has been introduced to man, a creature he needs to fear if he is to stay alive.The season changes to fall, and then to winter, rapidly.  And soon spring is again on the horizon.  And then ... the fire.  In all the confusion, Bambi loses sight of his mother.  After he reaches safety, Bambi inquires about his mother.  He is told, &quot;Your mother can't be with you any longer&quot;.Bambi must face the new season without his mother now.  When spring arrives, he, Thumper and Flower have grown.  Bambi is attracted to another deer, Faline.  They kiss, and Bambi is instancely in love.  However, Bambi must put his feelings aside when man re-enters the forest.  Again there is another scramble for safety.  Faline is being tailed by some hunters, and Bambi goes in to help her, getting shot in the process.  He makes it to safety, but must contend with another forest fire, set by the hunters who were camping nearby.The cycle is thus complete.  And new life is being born, and will continue to be born, live and die.  There will be new perils to face, and new wonders to discover.  This is the essence of &quot;Bambi&quot;; that nature is a continuous cycle of life and death, and eveything in-between is a wonderous adventure, and that all living creatures must live their lives to the fullest.There is the subtle message intertwined, as well, that man can, and must. control certain elements of nature, if nature is going to continue to thrive.  The second fire was the fault of man, caused by accident, but avoidable, which may have inadvertantly killed animals before it was extiguished.  And man must learn to control himself, for if he does not, then he will not only destroy nature, but himself.",5,The Film That Spurned Disney's Fascination With Nature,1005955200,"11 17, 2001",2001,3194,"['been', 'critisized', 'use', 'violence', 'depicting', 'natural', 'wildfire', 'death', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'not', 'easy', 'explain', 'young', 'children', 'been', 'critisized', 'others', 'being', 'quot', 'anti-human', 'man', 'depiction', 'hunting', 'scene', 'where', 'animals', 'are', 'being', 'shot', 'including', 'Bambi', 'who', 'wounded', 'hunter', 'quot', 'Bambi', 'quot', 'come', 'represent', 'gentler', 'side', 'Disney', 'what', 'worth', 'release', 'quot', 'Bambi', 'quot', '1942', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'began', 'long', 'fascinating', 'affair', 'nature', 'ultimately', 'produced', 'many', 'fine', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'nature', 'themed', 'films', 'none', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'fruition', 'quot', 'Bambi', 'quot', 'hardly', 'words', 'spoken', 'entirety', 'quot', 'Bambi', 'quot', 'relies', 'heavily', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'wide', 'range', 'color', 'depict', 'landscape', 'forest', 'almost', 'lifelike', 'fire', 'almost', 'too', 'real.In', 'opening', 'scene', 'quot', 'Bambi', 'quot', 'springtime', 'beginning', 'new', 'life', 'Bambi', 'born', 'first', 'days', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'such', 'things', 'how', 'walk', 'friends', 'well', 'Thumper', 'rabbit', 'Flower', 'skunk', 'also', 'help', 'teach', 'Bambi', 'ways', 'forest.When', 'Bambi', 'first', 'exposed', 'meadow', 'mother', 'wonderful', 'place', 'remain', 'cautious', 'Later', 'out', 'why', 'when', 'man', 'enters', 'causing', 'deer', 'scramble', 'saftey', 'frenzied', 'flight', 'So', 'now', 'Bambi', 'been', 'introduced', 'man', 'creature', 'fear', 'stay', 'alive.The', 'season', 'changes', 'fall', 'then', 'winter', 'rapidly', 'soon', 'spring', 'again', 'horizon', 'then', 'fire', 'confusion', 'Bambi', 'sight', 'mother', 'safety', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'told', 'quot', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'longer', 'quot', 'must', 'face', 'new', 'season', 'mother', 'now', 'When', 'spring', 'Thumper', 'Flower', 'have', 'grown', 'Bambi', 'attracted', 'deer', 'Faline', 'kiss', 'Bambi', 'instancely', 'love', 'However', 'Bambi', 'must', 'put', 'feelings', 'aside', 'when', 'man', 'forest', 'Again', 'scramble', 'safety', 'Faline', 'being', 'tailed', 'hunters', 'Bambi', 'help', 'getting', 'shot', 'process', 'safety', 'must', 'contend', 'forest', 'fire', 'set', 'hunters', 'who', 'were', 'camping', 'nearby.The', 'cycle', 'thus', 'complete', 'new', 'life', 'being', 'born', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'born', 'live', 'die', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'perils', 'face', 'new', 'wonders', 'discover', 'essence', 'quot', 'Bambi', 'quot', 'nature', 'continuous', 'cycle', 'life', 'death', 'eveything', 'in-between', 'wonderous', 'adventure', 'living', 'creatures', 'must', 'live', 'lives', 'fullest.There', 'subtle', 'message', 'intertwined', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'can', 'must', 'control', 'certain', 'elements', 'nature', 'nature', 'going', 'continue', 'thrive', 'second', 'fire', 'was', 'fault', 'man', 'caused', 'accident', 'avoidable', 'may', 'have', 'inadvertantly', 'killed', 'animals', 'was', 'extiguished', 'man', 'must', 'learn', 'control', 'not', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'destroy', 'nature']",N/A

I first saw this beautiful movie as a child in grammar school. What I most remember is a teacher comforting me while I cried as Bambi called out to his mother, I heard the shot and realized his mother was dead. I thought that I had remembered the whole movie. What I did not remember was the brutality, but that shows just how powerfully positive this movie really is. Early on in the movie Bambi's mother alerts him to dangers of man and his guns. You see Bambi cowering before coming out to play in the meadow. Later his mother is killed; the forest is burned. A bird panics and is killed on the fly. Oh My! Of course, Spring arrives and all is right with the world again. If your little one is going to watch this video, it would do well to stay nearby, just in case he or she has questions. That being said, there are many positives in this beautiful animated movie. Although you never see Thumper's dad there is a lot of sage advice from him. When Thumper says that baby Bambi ""doesn't walk very good, does he?"", his mother reply's ""What did your father say?"" Thumper lowers his head and responds  ""If you can't say somethin nice, don't say nothin' at all.""  There are other bits of wisdom because Thumper, the little rabbit, just has to say what he thinks and feels.This movie has everything we hold dear; family, a parents love, enduring friendship, death, rebirth of nature and becoming adult and having your own family. Walt Disney's Bambi is about the circle of life.Each of the animated characters have their own larger-than-life personalities, and all are quite beautiful. Each one has an  outstanding feature that makes him memorable and perhaps your favorite character. Bambi's beautiful eyes when he looks up for the first time, Flower's (the skunk) blush when he meets his lady love, the wise owl when he becomes grumpy and puffs out his huge chest. If you are interested in the how and why of film-making buy the digital restored 2 disc version, the second disc has good inside information on Disney's meetings, his notes, etc. This disc also has eight interactive games and more for children.This is definitely a must see movie.[...]",5,A Children's Classic,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,2248,"['recently', 'watched', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'film', 'Bambi', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'years', 'What', 'joy', 'was', 'first', 'saw', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'child', 'grammar', 'school', 'What', 'most', 'remember', 'teacher', 'comforting', 'cried', 'Bambi', 'called', 'out', 'mother', 'heard', 'shot', 'realized', 'mother', 'was', 'dead', 'thought', 'had', 'remembered', 'whole', 'movie', 'What', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'was', 'brutality', 'just', 'how', 'powerfully', 'positive', 'movie', 'really', 'Early', 'movie', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'dangers', 'man', 'guns', 'see', 'Bambi', 'cowering', 'coming', 'out', 'play', 'meadow', 'Later', 'mother', 'killed', 'forest', 'burned', 'bird', 'panics', 'killed', 'fly', 'Oh', 'course', 'Spring', 'right', 'world', 'again', 'little', 'one', 'going', 'watch', 'video', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'stay', 'nearby', 'just', 'case', 'questions', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'many', 'positives', 'beautiful', 'animated', 'movie', 'never', 'see', 'Thumper', 'dad', 'lot', 'sage', 'advice', 'When', 'Thumper', 'baby', 'Bambi', ""n't"", 'walk', 'very', 'good', 'mother', 'reply', 'What', 'did', 'father', 'say', 'lowers', 'head', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'somethin', 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'nothin', 'are', 'other', 'bits', 'wisdom', 'Thumper', 'little', 'rabbit', 'just', 'say', 'what', 'feels.This', 'movie', 'everything', 'hold', 'dear', 'family', 'parents', 'love', 'enduring', 'friendship', 'death', 'rebirth', 'nature', 'becoming', 'adult', 'having', 'own', 'family', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Bambi', 'circle', 'life.Each', 'animated', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'larger-than-life', 'personalities', 'are', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'one', 'outstanding', 'feature', 'memorable', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'character', 'Bambi', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'when', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'Flower', 'skunk', 'blush', 'when', 'lady', 'love', 'wise', 'owl', 'when', 'grumpy', 'puffs', 'out', 'huge', 'chest', 'are', 'interested', 'how', 'why', 'film-making', 'buy', 'digital', 'restored', '2', 'disc', 'version', 'second', 'disc', 'good', 'information', 'Disney', 'meetings', 'notes', 'etc', 'disc', 'also', 'eight', 'interactive', 'games', 'more', 'children.This', 'definitely', 'must', 'see', 'movie.', '[', ']']",N/A
79131,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0788806270,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[73, 82]","Walt Disney opened the vein of fear that drives children and adults alike with his animated classic films. Disney understood, like the Grimms before him, that the same fears are at the heart of what motivate children as they do adults. In the uncertain and haunted world of the 40's where war and loss hung like a specter stalking every aspect of American life, Disney mined that vein of fear, loss and death and turned it on its head recognizing that the optimism and can-do attitude of the American dream could triumph but not undo the nightmares of the past. That's why Walt's films continue to resonate today even with fancy computer animated effects and larger than life villains. He knew that the worst monsters could be our next door neighbors. Disney adapted a modern sensibility to the same fears that the Grimms paraded in their tales.That's why ""Bambi"" despite its pacing from a slower, less attention challenged era still has power and poignancy. As a kid everything you need to know about life can be learned from a Walt Disney film. The loss of innocence, the cruelty of others, the compassion of friends and the big ""D"" all crop up in every Disney film. It's ironic because Disney's films, unlike other animators of the time, weren't afraid to tackle the very things that both scared and delighted kids. The two big themes that figure in Disney films rear their heads in ""Bambi"" when death and the cruel world outside try to erase Bambi's innocence from existence. We're immediately thrown into Bambi's world and his life with his mom. When Bambi's mom is killed he becomes an orphan adopted by his new found friends Thumper and Flower. Kids will love the interaction between these characters. While the film's pacing may be a tad slow for children below the age of six used to the rapid fire editing of  ""Aladdin"" and more recent Disney classics, the colorful landscape and the delightful characters will keep most children entranced.Featuring a terrific restoration, ""Bambi"" has never looked better on DVD. Like many films of the era ""Bambi"" was shot on nitrate stock which disintegrates fairly rapidly over time so the miracle here is that it looks as good as it does (due to careful care) and the magic of digital technology. The images sparkle with a crystal clear image almost too perfect. The rich color, deep dark blacks and detail in the images are truly astonishing. The remastered sound makes fairly good use of the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround medium as well. Given that the original film's soundtrack was mono, the surround speakers are used surprisingly well. You'll have to reset your expectations though as this 60 year old film wasn't designed with any of our home theater equipment in mind.""Bambi"" has a forest full of extras in this two disc set. The most important extras on the first DVD is the comparison between the finished film along side images from story meetings, script notes, surviving production drawings and other items that give you a sense of the preparation that went into making this animated classic. We get to see the amazing restoration process for the film itself from the cleaning of the original nitrate negative (stored at the Library of Congress) to the expansion of the original soundtrack for home theater equipment and movie theater exhibition. There's also the classic award winning animated short ""The Old Mill"". Again, many of Disney's cartoons from the 30's and 40's don't have the manic energy we've come to expect in our post-Looney Tunes/Animanics world but the quieter, slower qualities are actually appealing after one too many frantic animated adventure. ""Tricks of the Trade"" was originally shot for the Disney's TV show in the 50's and takes us behind-the-scenes allowing us to see the difficult and time consuming process of making animated feature films before the advent of computers. ""The Art of Bambi"" allows us in the Disney archive to see the surviving preproduction artwork, design elements and storyboards.  ""Disney Time Capsule"" provides viewers with a glimpse into the world that spawned ""Bambi"". ""The Forest Adventure Game"" will be entertaining for most children over the age of six as it may take a bit too much skill for anyone below that age to master. There's also two surviving deleted scenes (which is a surprise given the age of the film but Disney is nothing if not methodical).  We learn a bit about America during World War II and the type of society that America was creating for itself. ""Bambi's Forest Friends"" focuses on how deer live in the wild. We also get the original theatrical trailer (which provides an interesting contrast to the restored film). Most of these extras will be of interest more to the adults that grew up watching ""Bambi"" in theaters, on TV and early home video.An engaging film from another era that still has tremendous power and is entertaining, ""Bambi"" has never looked this spry before. I imagine that this DVD looks better than the original release did in the 1940's as resolution and theater standards were quite different then.",5,Classy presentation of classic film,1109980800,"03 5,

79132,ARFCORBCTKX1J,0788806270,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 9]","I'll hand out the good news before my usual overwrought commentary.""Pinocchio"" is often praised as the most-beautiful animated film ever made, but (for this viewer) it doesn't come close to ""Bambi"". Landscapes are always popular subjects for art (painted or photographed), and ""Bambi"" is nothing if not one huge landscape. From the extended Multiplane sequence that pulls us into the depths of the forest, to the breadth of the meadow on which the deer gambol, the artwork is not merely a background, but a devotional act of ""love of Nature"".On a 60"" plasma display, this is both subtle and stunning. As with the BD of ""Pinocchio"", you feel you're seeing details that were never previously visible -- as well as the work and commitment that went into creating the art.Even more significant are the expressionistic sequences, particularly the one in which Bambi fights Ronno for Faline. This was just the sort of thing that should have impressed the artsy-fartsy types who first praised Disney, then turned on him, but it appears not to have. ""Bambi"" was Disney's last major attempt at serious experimentation.I and others have questioned whether earlier Disney transfers took into account Technicolor's errors, to more-accurately represent the artists' intent. This doesn't seem to be an issue with ""Bambi"". With the exception of two blue-and-yellow birds near the beginning, the hue and saturation look consistently ""right"" throughout. And the general ""clean-up"" of the image adds to one's appreciation of the art and animation, rather than looking ""sterile"" (as it does in ""Pinocchio"").The liner notes describe this and other Disney Blu-ray films as ""Digitally restored beyond their original brilliance"". Ignoring the fact that the writer doesn't know what ""restored"" means, this statement suggests that Disney management isn't worried whether the home-video editions accurately present the way the film originally looked. Am I being unreasonable in feeling it should?Well... Yes and no. Many live-action films are transferred from the composite or camera negative, which improves image quality to a level not seen in theaters, and no one complains. And in watching the three-strip transfers of ""Meet Me in St Louis"" and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", I never had a ""That doesn't look right"" reaction. But one /does/ have such reactions with early Disney animation, when colors seem to have the wrong hue, or to be overly saturated. I'll let this drop for the time being.As for the story... Walt Disney was a life-long animal lover, and ""Bambi"" presents a view of ""Nature"" and Man's relationship to it that is too-often naive and sentimental. In Bambi's world, Man is the only carnivore. When ""Friend Owl"" returns in the morning, we aren't told what was doing at night, nor that he might consider Thumper a tasty treat. (A mother owl with young to feed would make short work of Herr Hare.) And where are the wolves? * Without wolves to cull the deer, those lovable forest rats (which is what deer really are) would consume so much vegetation that little would be left to get them through the Winter. (To its credit, ""Bambi"" shows the deer in Winter in a state of near-starvation.)I object to killing animals wantonly, or simply to acquire a trophy. (This appears to have been Disney's view of hunting.) But what's wrong with eating them? (""Venison -- it's Bambilicious!"") To object to killing wildlife for food (especially in areas where predators have been decimated to protect ranching), while eating pork or beef, is hypocrisy.""Bambi""'s cutesy anthropomorphism remains reasonably controlled until Spring (rutting season) arrives. The film degenerates into icky sexual innuendo, with the birdies billing and cooing in a sickening manner, the females ""coming on"" aggressively to the males (the opposite of what actually occurs), ** and mammals actually blushing over their entire bodies -- ignoring Mark Twain's famous observation. This is typical Disney -- presenting what might make the viewer uncomfortable in an inappropriately comic manner, or ignoring it altogether. It's particularly odd coming from a producer whose films traumatized children with scenes that cut to the core of their deepest fears -- in particular, the separation of a child from its mother, of which ""Bambi"" remains the prime example. Of course, it's easy to dramatize fear -- more-subtle emotions are harder to handle, and Disney often ignored them.Disney's view of Man's relationship with Nature was so distorted that he considered showing that the hunters who accidentally started the forest fire were killed by it, anticipating one of the themes of ""Deliverance"". (He was talked out of this by Morey, Pearce, and others, who felt that Man should never be shown, not even as a shadow.) In real life, Man's principal bad influences on wildlife have been the wholesale killing of predators and the destruction of habitat -- not the wanton murder of poor, innocent deer mommies. (There's a wonderful moment in ""Alaska: the Last Frontier"" when Atz Lee says to his wife ""We got Bambi -- and his mother, too!"".)Anthropomorphism notwithstanding, *** ""Bambi"" is a beautiful film with many iconic moments and characters. Visually, it represents /the/ artistic high point of Disney animation. Nothing, before or since, comes close. It is impossible not to recommend it, if only because it demonstrates how pervasive and profound Disney's influence on culture and society were -- and remain.* The wolves are implied when Bambi's mother warns him of danger on the meadow. But we later learn the danger she worries about is Man.** When Bambi fights the older stag for Faline, it comes off as if he's trying to protect her from ""molestation"".*** There's an adorable field mouse drawn in a completely realistic fashion. It shows what the animators could have done if they hadn't been restrained by the need to appeal to an unsophisticated audience.",5,"""Oh, my God -- they killed Bambi's mother!

I was so glad that she loved it, because of all the gaudy and garish animated features out there that have been the staple of television these past years. ""Bambi"" has universal themes that many of us can relate to - the love between a parent and a child [Bambi and his mom], the camaraderie between friends [as epitomized by Bambi, Thumper the rabbit, and Flower the skunk], sadness and grief in the face of death [when Bambi loses his mother to hunters], and the bond between father and child, amongst others.My preschooler did wonder what happened to Bambi's mother, so I had to explain [in the movie, this scene is very tastefully done, so that the actual death scene is only alluded to but not explicitly portrayed]. There are so many valuable lessons in this movie that can be mined for either family discussions or even classroom use. The movie may have been made in the 1940s, but the lush colors and heartwarming story will ensure this remains a classic in the stable of animated features for years to come!",5,Even after all these years. this perennial classic has the power to enthrall,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,1138,"['Bambi', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'longing', 'share', 'young', 'daughter', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'loved', 'gaudy', 'garish', 'animated', 'features', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'staple', 'television', 'past', 'years', 'Bambi', 'universal', 'themes', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'love', 'parent', 'child', '[', 'Bambi', 'mom', ']', 'camaraderie', 'friends', '[', 'epitomized', 'Bambi', 'Thumper', 'rabbit', 'Flower', 'skunk', ']', 'sadness', 'grief', 'face', 'death', '[', 'when', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'hunters', ']', 'bond', 'father', 'child', 'amongst', 'others.My', 'preschooler', 'did', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'had', 'explain', '[', 'movie', 'scene', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done', 'actual', 'death', 'scene', 'only', 'alluded', 'not', 'explicitly', 'portrayed', ']', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'mined', 'family', 'discussions', 'even', 'classroom', 'use', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'made', '1940s', 'lush', 'colors', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'will', 'ensure', 'classic', 'stable', 'animated', 'features', 'years', 'come']",N/A
