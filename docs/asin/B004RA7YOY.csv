She did the part very well but the best scene is in the bathroom.  What a hoot!  Gross Anatomy and Betsy's Wedding are fun films too but Betty Lou does rock.,4,Betty Lou is a Hoot,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,274,"['enjoyed', 'movies', 'Betty', 'Lou', 'just', 'what', 'most', 'women', 'feel', 'times', 'Glossed', 'subhuman', 'did', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'best', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'What', 'hoot', 'Gross', 'Anatomy', 'Betsy', 'Wedding', 'are', 'fun', 'films', 'too', 'Betty', 'Lou', 'rock']",N/A

I'm not going to review the movies, I bought this because I love them. The DVD was in excellent condition, I watched each movie separately with no problems. There are no real extras, there seldom are with these multi-movie sets.  But for the price I wouldn't expect any.  I don't think there are any edits from the originals, if there are I didn't catch them so they wouldn't be significant.  All in all it was a good deal.",5,Wanted this Forever,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,517,"['bought', 'two', 'movies', 'Gun', 'Betty', 'Lou', 'Handbag', 'Betsy', 'Wedding', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'review', 'movies', 'bought', 'love', 'DVD', 'was', 'excellent', 'condition', 'watched', 'movie', 'separately', 'problems', 'are', 'real', 'extras', 'seldom', 'are', 'multi-movie', 'sets', 'price', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'edits', 'originals', 'are', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'significant', 'was', 'good', 'deal']",N/A
