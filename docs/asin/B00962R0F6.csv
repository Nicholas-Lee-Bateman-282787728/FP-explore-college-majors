Luis Fernando,"[1, 5]","I hate the fact that the Package Art format is completely different from the past 4 seasons, so now it looks very incongruent on the shelf. And it is NOT  because of the network change, because Season 4 aired on BET and the dvd has the same format as the first 3 seasons which aired on the CW. So I don't know why change it in this season, when the fans already have 4 dvds with the same style and now we're stuck with 1 that has a completely different design.",2,Package Art,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,460,"['hate', 'fact', 'Package', 'Art', 'format', 'completely', 'different', 'past', '4', 'seasons', 'so', 'now', 'very', 'incongruent', 'shelf', 'NOT', 'network', 'change', 'Season', '4', 'aired', 'BET', 'dvd', 'same', 'format', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'aired', 'CW', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'change', 'season', 'when', 'fans', 'already', 'have', '4', 'dvds', 'same', 'style', 'now', ""'re"", 'stuck', '1', 'completely', 'different', 'design']",The Game: Season 5

Malik struggled with his sobriety and Tasha found love with Pookie, her childhood goon friend.

I love the game because they have a beautiful cast. It has funny moments and serious moments, but i enjoy the jokes and the beautiful men they have on the show. What i disliked about this season was the fact that it was pooch hall and tia mowry-hardict last season and when season 6 begins they will not be apart of it. If you followed all the other seasons before this, this is a must buy just for the fact of being team derwin or team melanie.",5,The Game Season 5,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,519,"['Game', 'series', 'professional', 'football', 'players', 'lives', 'love', 'game', 'have', 'beautiful', 'cast', 'funny', 'moments', 'serious', 'moments', 'i', 'enjoy', 'jokes', 'beautiful', 'men', 'have', 'show', 'What', 'i', 'disliked', 'season', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'pooch', 'hall', 'tia', 'mowry-hardict', 'last', 'season', 'when', 'season', '6', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'apart', 'followed', 'other', 'seasons', 'must', 'buy', 'just', 'fact', 'being', 'team', 'derwin', 'team', 'melanie']",The Game: Season 5
