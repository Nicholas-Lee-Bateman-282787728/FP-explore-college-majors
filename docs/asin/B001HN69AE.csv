1201591,A36HAX6ET5TZQF,B001HN69AE,"Aburenbo Shogun ""takezo_dono""","[1, 9]","This movie is Not like the anime.  The movie is very short so it takes a tongue and cheek perspective of DBZ.  Sure the the movie can be corny and special efects unrealistic, but that's the Idea.  Stephen Chow is a genius at making quirky toung and cheek martial arts action movies.  If you think this move was corny then you have not watched Shaolin Soccer, which was his break out movie to international stardom.I like DBZ evolution.  it's funny, witty, and lots of action.  If you are watching the movie and saying ""Goku did not do this, Picolo did not do that, or that so not like the cartoon""  then you are too DBZ fanatic for this movie and will not even give it a chance.  I have seen actual DBZ movies such as Broly, Super Android 13, Tree of Might, Dead Zone, World's Strongest.  The older movies were good. But Broly and Android 13 are just plain awful movies, and the later movies are even worse.  DBZ evolution is more accessible to non anime watching people, and is entertaining.DBZ Fanboys hate this movie because it's not like DBZ cartoon, no mater how fun it is, just as FF7 fanboys love Advent Children because it has their beloved characters from the game are in there unchanged eventhough the movie tanks in the fun department.",3,Better than you think if your not a DBZ fanatic,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,1246,"['movie', 'Not', 'anime', 'movie', 'very', 'short', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'perspective', 'DBZ', 'Sure', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'corny', 'special', 'efects', 'unrealistic', 'Idea', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'genius', 'making', 'quirky', 'toung', 'cheek', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'movies', 'think', 'move', 'was', 'corny', 'then', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'was', 'break', 'out', 'movie', 'international', 'stardom.I', 'DBZ', 'evolution', 'funny', 'witty', 'lots', 'action', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'saying', 'Goku', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'Picolo', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'cartoon', 'then', 'are', 'too', 'DBZ', 'fanatic', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'give', 'chance', 'have', 'seen', 'actual', 'DBZ', 'movies', 'such', 'Broly', 'Super', 'Android', '13', 'Tree', 'Might', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'World', 'Strongest', 'older', 'movies', 'were', 'good', 'Broly', 'Android', '13', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'movies', 'later', 'movies', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'DBZ', 'evolution', 'more', 'accessible', 'non', 'anime', 'watching', 'people', 'entertaining.DBZ', 'Fanboys', 'hate', 'movie', 'not', 'like', 'DBZ', 'cartoon', 'mater', 'how', 'fun', 'just', 'FF7', 'love', 'Advent', 'Children', 'beloved', 'characters', 'game', 'are', 'there', 'unchanged', 'movie', 'tanks', 'fun', 'department']",Dragonball: Evolution
1201592,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B001HN69AE,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[6, 19]","Okay, so this film was ripped apart by critics and fans of the DBZ franchise. This film was completely stupid, ludicrous in the extreme, filled to the brim with bad dialogue, and GOD HELP ME I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT! Now mind you, I am not a DBZ fan (Though I have seen a few episodes and it was entertaining), but I choose to look at films from just a film point, not from a source material point (The only film I ever watched that I expected to follow its source material was Watchmen, and I was very satisfied). If you are a fan of the hugely popular anime show, then I definitely don't recommend this to you and you should just walk away from this review. But, if you love cheesy martial arts films and have been looking for an awesome B-movie, then let's proceed with my raving review of this film.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When Goku turns eighteen, his grandfather gives him a dragonball, in which there are only seven known to be in existence. But when the villain Piccolo escapes from his prison, he intends to find all the dragonballs because when all seven are together, a dragon can be summoned to grant one wish. So after Goku's grandfather is killed, Goku goes on a quest with friends to stop Piccolo before he finds all seven and his wish to rule to world is done. Oh yeah, it definitely doesn't follow its source material, but good God it's so damn awesome to watch.MUSIC: The music as any martial arts flick should be, it's awesome to listen to and never gets boring. It fits everything so nicely and it transitions quite well.ACTING: Oh it's bad. The dialogue is pure comedy gold, especially when you hear characters spout off lines such as ""The dragonballs are within my grasp,"" or ""Hey! We've still got our dragonballs!"" as well as other comical lines. Any gripes with the bad acting is done away with because this area is so damn funny. No wonder I get a lot more laughs out of these kinds of films instead of intentional comedies.ACTION: This film has awesome action scenes. Whether it be a fight sequence or even some shootouts, this film never fails to be consistently entertaining. Sure they may be over-the-top, but they are spectacular and should please anyone who isn't stuck up and intent on having every film be a serious endeavor. This film provides plenty of amusing, escapist martial arts fun that just plain rocks. This film just never got boring somehow, and I'll go as far as to say that I liked it better than the Mortal Kombat films. Call me crazy, I loved this awesome film.OVERALL: One of the best B-movies ever made. Delightfully campy, completely over-the-top, filled with spectacular action scenes, awesome music, and funny humor, Dragonball Evolution is a dream come true for B-movie fanatics while it's a nightmare for DBZ fans thanks to the fact it almost completely ignores its source material. I recommend you rent it first before buying it, because most likely you won't be showering it with praise like me.THE GOOD: Awesome over-the-top action scenes, awesome music, totally campy dialogue and humor, and it's just a damn awesome film all around.THE BAD: Underdeveloped storytelling and its B-movie qualities will not be enjoyed by some.",5,ONE OF THE BEST B-MOVIES EVER!!  9 OUT OF 10,1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,3179,"['Okay', 'film', 'was', 'ripped', 'apart', 'critics', 'fans', 'DBZ', 'franchise', 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'stupid', 'ludicrous', 'extreme', 'filled', 'brim', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'GOD', 'HELP', 'ME', 'LOVED', 'EVERY', 'MINUTE', 'IT', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'DBZ', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'entertaining', 'choose', 'look', 'films', 'just', 'film', 'point', 'not', 'source', 'material', 'point', 'only', 'film', 'ever', 'watched', 'expected', 'follow', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'Watchmen', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'are', 'fan', 'hugely', 'popular', 'anime', 'show', 'then', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'should', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'review', 'love', 'cheesy', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'awesome', 'B-movie', 'then', 'let', 'proceed', 'raving', 'review', 'film.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'When', 'Goku', 'eighteen', 'grandfather', 'dragonball', 'are', 'only', 'seven', 'known', 'be', 'existence', 'when', 'villain', 'Piccolo', 'prison', 'find', 'dragonballs', 'when', 'seven', 'are', 'together', 'dragon', 'can', 'be', 'summoned', 'grant', 'one', 'wish', 'So', 'Goku', 'grandfather', 'killed', 'Goku', 'quest', 'friends', 'stop', 'Piccolo', 'seven', 'wish', 'rule', 'world', 'done', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'follow', 'source', 'material', 'good', 'God', 'so', 'damn', 'awesome', 'watch.MUSIC', 'music', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', 'should', 'be', 'awesome', 'listen', 'never', 'boring', 'everything', 'so', 'nicely', 'quite', 'well.ACTING', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'pure', 'comedy', 'gold', 'especially', 'when', 'hear', 'characters', 'spout', 'lines', 'such', 'dragonballs', 'are', 'grasp', 'Hey', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'dragonballs', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'comical', 'lines', 'gripes', 'bad', 'acting', 'done', 'away', 'area', 'so', 'damn', 'funny', 'wonder', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'kinds', 'films', 'instead', 'intentional', 'comedies.ACTION', 'film', 'awesome', 'action', 'scenes', 'be', 'fight', 'sequence', 'even', 'shootouts', 'film', 'never', 'be', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'Sure', 'may', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'spectacular', 'should', 'please', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'stuck', 'up', 'intent', 'having', 'film', 'be', 'serious', 'endeavor', 'film', 'plenty', 'amusing', 'escapist', 'martial', 'arts', 'fun', 'just', 'plain', 'rocks', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'boring', 'somehow', ""'ll"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'liked', 'better', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'films', 'Call', 'crazy', 'loved', 'awesome', 'film.OVERALL', 'One', 'best', 'B-movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Delightfully', 'campy', 'completely', 'over-the-top', 'filled', 'spectacular', 'action', 'scenes', 'awesome', 'music', 'funny', 'humor', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'B-movie', 'fanatics', 'nightmare', 'DBZ', 'fans', 'thanks', 'fact', 'almost', 'completely', 'source', 'material', 'recommend', 'rent', 'first', 'buying', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'showering', 'praise', 'me.THE', 'GOOD', 'Awesome', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'scenes', 'awesome', 'music', 'totally', 'campy', 'dialogue', 'humor', 'just', 'damn', 'awesome', 'film', 'around.THE', 'BAD', 'Underdeveloped', 'storytelling', 'B-movie', 'qualities', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyed']",Dragonball: Evolution
1201593,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B001HN69AE,Adam B. Krenn,"[2, 3]","Okay, how about a review and not a rant?Dragonball, the Manga turned Anime was a lot of things but mostly it was zany. Filled with corny charm thanks to Akira Toriyama's sense of humor it followed the adventures of a young, precocious and extremely self-assured adventurous young boy named Goku and the friends he meets and makes along the way.This movie, sadly, is really none of those things. Here we have a teen-aged Goku that is forced into the Hollywood-esque cookie cutter of powerful teenage boy that lacks self-confidence and must deal with bullies in High-school, albeit in a slightly different way than we're used to. He's not scared he just tries very hard to do as his Grandfather wishes. Okay, this is for fans to complain about but what about someone seeing it for the first time?Where this film's version of Goku fails is the sometimes on-again off-again confidence of Goku. One scene he is pensive the next he is arrogant.At times the script contradicted itself through its characters regarding major story elements, i.e. Prometheus Globe / Dragon Ball(s).Bulma and her guns. I don't remember Bulma ever being a female Mod version of Dirty Harry? Odd choice considering this film felt as if it was geared towards 5-10 year old American kids.Okay, some cons overall:Capsule technology: Did we really need more Transformer-esque morphing vehicles with their heavily angular design? It seems this movie could have actually borrowed from Akira Toriyama's designs and gave it a unique look with new and unique CGI effects to marvel at. Instead we got the same old, same old.The story was relatively dull and oozed ""I've seen this done better"" feel throughout. It didn't feel inspired in anyway. While the performances were generally good (or at least serviceable) the only real stand-out was Joon Park as Yamcha. Despite some character changes, he acted and sounded very much like the source character and carried a charisma that felt lacking from the other actors.Considering this film is actually filled with talented actors that have carried other films quite competently, I can only blame the director for what seems to be a lack of charisma and cohesion between characters overall.Some fan specific complaints1.) Almost completely ignored the source material and altered some of the plot that completely changes these characters potential future.2.) The Heavy, Piccolo, played by James Marsters was virtually non-existent in this film and when he was in a scene he was forgettable. Very odd considering Marsters stands out in just about every other thing he has done.3.) Goku in High School? Yikes. It goes without saying that this character was altered so much as to become a different character completely yet going by the same name. What I found most odd regarding how they changed Goku is that the Original pre-teen Goku (from the Manga/Anime) appealed to me greatly. I remember thinking, ""Wow! This kid is self reliant and not afraid of anything! I wish I was that way!"" And hence, I fell in love with the character. This film's sort of ""everyman"" Goku came off as very dull.4.) The man sized Oozaru as Goku's transformation form. Huh? Man-sized? While it/he looked kind of cool for live action, he was just the size of a big man.5.) Akria Toriyama's sense of humor was SORELY missing in this film.6.) This Earth was simply a future version of our own. Gone was the alternate Earth from the manga/anime and its unique culture/geography, art design and almost allegorical/fairy-tale feel.7.) This film isn't even 90 minutes long? Very strange considering Dragon Ball and DBZ always carried a very epic (in some cases too epic) feel to them.I could go on (and on and on, actually) but I think I've blustered enough. If you are a fan of the Manga and/or Anime as I am, do yourself a favor and don't bother.If you're new to Dragon Ball, go out and rent the Anime, it is one of Akira Toriyama's visions (the other and probably more pure is the Manga) and is by far superior to this film despite its later episode flaws.If you are looking to entertain a group of 5-10 year olds, this movie is MEH at best and you would do better renting/buying any number of other films or better yet the original Anime.",2,Dragonball?

I am a James Marsters fan from Buffy/Angel and I got a couple of other movies he was in to round out the collection.Quite a few parts of the plot stayed the same.Although they should have made Goku's Oozaru form gigantic and actually destroy some buildings in the city or something before he reverted.Also the girls should have been less aggressive.I did expect a young asian or asian looking actor to play Goku but Chatwick did well in the role.And of course the great Chow Yun-Fat did exceptionally well in his role.I think the modernization of the film caused the plot holes.they mixed Goku and Gohan's roles by letting Goku go to formal high school. Also where was the OX King?

I'm not reviewing the blu-ray features because, If a movie sucks so bad why the hell would you (or I) want to watch the special features?First off, the Main Story is severely butchered to the point where everything unrecognizable to the original. The story is told very hasty and they don't bother to explain anything, and The've also rip off ideas from other great films... Dragon ball is known for great edge of your seat fighting Anime sequences, but in this movie There aren't any good fighting scenes AT ALL! None, Zero.Second: There are absolutely NO character development in this movie at all, Bulma comes out of Nowhere holding a gun and says: they've stolen the dragonballs can you help? And Goku helps her, for no apparent reason. they team up and find master roshi, who likes to talk while he waves his hands, for no apparent reason!?.Third: In the Anime and Manga, the main character Goku is supposed to be a happy, fun, cheerful, energetic character that only gets mad when bad people are doing bad things. In this movie goku is nothing but a stupid teenage kid who can't get a girlfriend, ride his bike to school and spends half of the movie feeling sorry for himself. (Lame!) And The DIALONG IN THIS FILM IS THE WORST I'VE EVER HEARD!Fourth: For unknown reasons, one of the main character, Krillin does not appear in this movie (and I don't know why?). And for more unknown CRAPtacular reasons They used The Kamehame wave, (which is suppose to be a destructive beam technique) TO revive Goku as he lays on the ground because he's about to die, over a small idiotic gun shot wound. (I'm not even afraid to spill anything for you because your not gonna go see this)Fifth: The ending battle between Goku and Picollo is SO retarded!, Goku throws a big Kamahame wave (which looks totally fake) and all you see is bright lights, They don't even show when piccolo gets hit!!! It's with out a doubt the Stupidest looking, CRAPtacular actions sequence I've ever seen in a action film!Sixth: The only relation this movie has to the original dragon ball is the Dragonballs themselves THAT'S IT! this movie should have been called The Passion, because it was 90 minutes of pure torture. This is purely Hollywood's best at Film Raping.Seventh: if you're a FAN of Dragonball, and even if you Not a fan of Dragonball, this movie is mediocre and disappointing from the beginning to end, It's Not entertaining, there's bad acting, the costumes in this movie looks like they found them laying around in back of a trashed Halloween store.

1201598,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001HN69AE,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Dragonball Evolution / B00260HH3K*Spoilers*I am a huge ""Dragonball Z"" fan, although I'll admit to never getting terribly involved in the original ""Dragonball"", largely because I felt the material was directed at a younger audience. The best description I can give, therefore, of ""Dragonball Evolution"" is that it attempts to combine the plot arc of ""Dragonball"" with the maturity of ""Dragonball Z"", with mixed results. And, I suspect, this mixture is part of why the movie was so poorly received.I'll start with the things I like about the movie. Although this is yet another variation on young-boy-learns-to-fight-and-gets-the-girl in a long series of westernized kung fu movies, I appreciate the fact that the young boy in question (Goku) starts out understanding that strength isn't about beating the bullies' faces in. I also appreciate that 'the girl' in question that he gets is a competent fighter in her own right, whilst eschewing the cliches of ""angry silent girl"" and/or ""bubblehead manic pixie dream girl"". Seriously, the Chi Chi depicted here seems like a normal, real human girl and that in of itself is a rarity in these movies. Bonus points for the fact that in humanizing Chi Chi, they avoided the ""violent shrew"" characterization that unfortunately pervades ""Dragonball Z"".As far as other ""Dragonball"" references go, Goku is fairly well played - a sweet natured boy learning to master his own strength. Of course, I was extremely disappointed that we didn't get a 'super saiyan' transformation, but this is DB, not DBZ, after all. Bulma is extremely well done - maintaining all the cleverness, spunk, and bravery of the cartoon version with none of the shrewish whining that gets shoe-horned in from time to time. Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) is scandalously true to form, but with an uncharacteristic seriousness, and Yamcha is well-played even if his entire purpose seems to be for an incredibly badly-dialogued romance with Bulma, but whatever.Unfortunately, I doubt this movie will please more than a handful. Hardcore Dragonball fans will probably be infuriated by the advanced age of the characters, the characterization changes, and the massive plot cuts performed in order to fit an entire TV series into a single movie. Dragonball Z fans will appreciate the aging and characterization, but will be turned off by the simplistic MacGuffin-fetching nature of the movie - something that Dragonball Z pretty much abandoned after the Namek/Frieza sagas. And, of course, movie-goers just looking for entertainment will point out that the plot is too cookie-cutter and well-worn to be of interest for long.Honestly, I wish I knew what the movie producers were thinking when they approved this script. I realize that MacGuffin-fetching quests in which everyone learns something are easy to churn-and-burn onto film, and maybe they will gross a profit at the end, but it would have been smarter, in my opinion, to discard the manic (and overdone) ""collect dragonballs!"" plot and instead focus on, say, the evolution of Piccolo or Vegeta from 'bad guy' to 'good guy' and focus on the redemptive powers of acceptance and friendship and working towards a common goal. A movie like that could have all the action you could want, but with a fine undercurrent of philosophy and well-written characterization, and I suspect would be far more interesting to viewers. Bad/Good-Guys are perpetually interesting, after all, and it would be a much more unusual plotline than ""everyone want magic ball, go get magic ball"" that has been done and redone so many times. But, hey, that's just my own opinion.Rent ""Dragonball Evolution"" if you're interested in a well-worn kung fu plotline that you've seen before a hundred times, but with slightly more fantastical characters and slightly better dialogue than some of the other clones out there. And if that sounds like criticism in the guise of faint praise, there could be something to that theory.This movie provides English closed captions for the hearing impaired.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Not So Great,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,4024,"['Evolution', '/', 'B00260HH3K*Spoilers*I', 'am', 'huge', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'never', 'getting', 'terribly', 'involved', 'original', 'Dragonball', 'largely', 'felt', 'material', 'was', 'directed', 'younger', 'audience', 'best', 'description', 'can', 'give', 'therefore', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'combine', 'plot', 'arc', 'Dragonball', 'maturity', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'mixed', 'results', 'suspect', 'mixture', 'part', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'received.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'things', 'like', 'movie', 'yet', 'variation', 'young-boy-learns-to-fight-and-gets-the-girl', 'long', 'series', 'westernized', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'young', 'boy', 'question', 'Goku', 'out', 'understanding', 'strength', ""n't"", 'beating', 'bullies', 'also', 'appreciate', ""'the"", 'girl', 'question', 'competent', 'fighter', 'own', 'right', 'whilst', 'eschewing', 'cliches', 'angry', 'silent', 'girl', 'bubblehead', 'manic', 'pixie', 'dream', 'girl', 'Seriously', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'depicted', 'here', 'normal', 'real', 'human', 'girl', 'rarity', 'movies', 'Bonus', 'points', 'fact', 'humanizing', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'avoided', 'violent', 'shrew', 'characterization', 'unfortunately', 'Dragonball', 'Z', '.As', 'far', 'other', 'Dragonball', 'references', 'go', 'Goku', 'fairly', 'well', 'played', 'sweet', 'natured', 'boy', 'learning', 'master', 'own', 'strength', 'course', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', ""'super"", 'saiyan', 'transformation', 'DB', 'not', 'DBZ', 'Bulma', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'maintaining', 'cleverness', 'spunk', 'bravery', 'cartoon', 'version', 'none', 'shrewish', 'whining', 'shoe-horned', 'time', 'time', 'Roshi', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'scandalously', 'true', 'form', 'uncharacteristic', 'seriousness', 'Yamcha', 'well-played', 'even', 'entire', 'purpose', 'be', 'incredibly', 'badly-dialogued', 'romance', 'Bulma', 'whatever.Unfortunately', 'doubt', 'movie', 'will', 'please', 'more', 'handful', 'Hardcore', 'Dragonball', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'infuriated', 'advanced', 'age', 'characters', 'characterization', 'changes', 'massive', 'plot', 'cuts', 'performed', 'order', 'fit', 'entire', 'TV', 'series', 'single', 'movie', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'aging', 'characterization', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'simplistic', 'MacGuffin-fetching', 'nature', 'movie', 'something', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'pretty', 'much', 'abandoned', 'Namek/Frieza', 'sagas', 'course', 'movie-goers', 'just', 'looking', 'entertainment', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'plot', 'too', 'cookie-cutter', 'well-worn', 'be', 'interest', 'long.Honestly', 'wish', 'knew', 'what', 'movie', 'producers', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'approved', 'script', 'realize', 'MacGuffin-fetching', 'quests', 'everyone', 'something', 'are', 'easy', 'churn-and-burn', 'film', 'maybe', 'will', 'gross', 'profit', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'smarter', 'opinion', 'discard', 'manic', 'overdone', 'collect', 'plot', 'instead', 'focus', 'say', 'evolution', 'Piccolo', 'Vegeta', ""'bad"", 'guy', ""'good"", 'guy', 'focus', 'redemptive', 'powers', 'acceptance', 'friendship', 'working', 'towards', 'common', 'goal', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'action', 'could', 'want', 'fine', 'undercurrent', 'philosophy', 'well-written', 'characterization', 'suspect', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'viewers', 'Bad/Good-Guys', 'are', 'perpetually', 'interesting', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'unusual', 'plotline', 'everyone', 'want', 'magic', 'ball', 'go', 'get', 'magic', 'ball', 'been', 'done', 'redone', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'hey', 'just', 'own', 'opinion.Rent', 'Evolution', ""'re"", 'interested', 'well-worn', 'kung', 'fu', 'plotline', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'slightly', 'more', 'fantastical', 'characters', 'slightly', 'better', 'dialogue', 'other', 'clones', 'there', 'like', 'criticism', 'guise', 'faint', 'praise', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'theory.This', 'movie', 'English', 'closed', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Dragonball: Evolution

1201603,A2WSVBL6NH1ZWO,B001HN69AE,Antony Chow,"[0, 0]","I approached the film Dragonball with no preconception of the Dragonball franchise, and evaluated it as a film.  American teenager Goku is depicted as an outcast of sorts in high school, for his unusual background (lives with asian grandpa, rides a scooter when everyone else has a car, etc.).  And he is head over heels for a asian girl named Chi-Chi.  Basically, you need to approach the film as a typical boy-saves-the-world kind of film, that just happened to have names and backdrop of the Dragonball manga/anime franchise.Another way of looking at the film is that it became ""Americanized.""  It's not an unusual approach.  For example, the anime show Cardcaptor Sakura was shown on TV years ago, in English track, with Americanized names and dialogue.  I think Twentieth Century Fox, the movie studio that produced this film, figured that having an Americanized version of Dragonball as a film would be profitable, and draw consumer interest from fans of the anime/manga franchise.  Of course, interest was drawn, along with boos and bad reviews from disappointed fans over this Americanization.The film itself is mediocre.  I don't think the plot was fleshed out enough to create a decent story.  Goku basically goes from one quest to another, in search for all seven Dragonballs, and defeat Piccolo.  The director tries to make the film interesting with all the fight scenes, and special effects.  But the fight sequences seem to stutter in a go-and-halt like fashion, rather than run smoothly.  Compare the fight scenes in this film with that of Mortal Combat, for example, and you'll see exactly what I mean.In my view, Dragaonball: Evolution is not the worst film of the year, as many reviewers proclaim in their reviews here.

1201604,A11PRT1CCVHB52,B001HN69AE,"B. Daniel ""ComicBOOK Lover""","[0, 4]","Now that I've seen it I can play devils advocate. This movie attempted to take 30+ episodes of a show a condense it into an hour and a half. I say they did a decent job considering the budget and source material. That's why I gave it 3 stars. They also kept closer to the source material than people want to admit.To ANYONE who has seen this and said this is the WORST movie they've seen they need to get out more(Desert Kickboxer, Vampire Assassin, Zombiez, Transmorphers, need I say more). Is it a good movie? NO. Sorry. But is it the worst ever. Not by far. First of all go see STreet Fighter: The LEgend of Chun-Li THAT was horrid. I actually wanted to watch the travesty that was the original Jean Claude Van Damme version.I am a DB/DBz fan. Have been for years, and I NEVER thought this was a good idea. Ok maybe when I first started watching it I said ""Hey that'd be cool if they made a real movie,"" and then I realized how bad it would be. NO ONE would take the plot of ths show seriously and there in lies the problem. The source material, as awesome as it is, is very weak. Carboard chracters with no real development over 400 episodes and 3 shows. Seriously. Here's the basic formula to the series:-Evil villain appears or threat of villain in found.-Heores begin training to prepare for battle-Battle ensues, someone dies.-Battle continues, Hero gains new power level, defeats villain-Deceased are wished back to life with Dragonballs.REPEAT!!!!That's it in a nutshell.THE GOOD...okay, fine the ACCEPTIBLE:-Gokou's perosnality. Gokou in the manga/anime is a very naive, good hearted, and brave character who loves to eat and fight. In the film he's been aged to his teens (Thank god cause the idea of watching a 12 year old as the protagonist for this is just scary), and yet his personality remains wholy unchanged. Yeah they use High School as a setting for him, but he's still good hearted, loves to eat, but instead of naive they made him slightly shy and out of place (which his son Gohan ends up feeling like later in the show). Justin Chatwin wasn't a great choice but he wasn't as bad as I thouhgt hed be. On another note though they should have spent more time training as his lack of any real fights was upsetting.-Piccollo. At least he looked the part. Wish he was on screen more. And with Marster's already being not only a fan but already being familiar with action, he should have had some kick ass fights, but I guess they didn't want him upstaging the hero.-Ki manipulation/energyballs/KameHameHa! Stuff looked good to me. The fight between Piccolo and Gokou at the end is the best, though still lacking. But it definitely invoked the spirit of the anime. The aura around Gokou as he powered up, the more intricate hand motions, and he definitely said it right. I actually got chills seeing that part. I wonder if the rest of the movie suffered because of it, cause it looks like that's where most of the budget went. Everyones crying about Gokou launching himself when he threw the KamHameHa, but Gohan did something similar in movie 9 against Bojack. Check it out.-Oozaru. So what if he wasn't 30 feet tall and there wasn't a tail. The tail woulda looked bad and so would a 30 foot tall were-monkey. They got the look right for the creature, and granted it didn't look that real, but it woulda looked worse at the giant size.-Roshi. Over the top is part of the character. If you don't like it then you hate the character. He was more perverted than the americanized cartoon version, and yet still had his moments of sagely advice. Yeah I know he wasn't bald, but hey Chow Yun Fat still did a great job bringing the character to life.THE BAD, and THE WORSE-Dialogue. Seriously? ""Believe it punk, you're getting your clock cleaned?"" Wow man.-Fights. What fights? Chi-Chi Vs Chi-Chi was the only real fight. Every thing else was pretty much throwing a punch or a kick at the camera or the generic bad guys they fight ONCE! The end fight looked cool until they get to the hand to hand stuff and it just falls apart. They basically embrace, spinn and punch each other in the face. An extra month or so of training and that coulda been a real DB fight. And thats the thing, thats what the show is all about, and to take that out of it is taking away the best part of the show.-Yamcha. UM WHat? Personality was right (minus the fear of girls), but other than that he was useless. I woulda loved to see him and Gokou go at it, and knock the crap outta him with the ""Wolf Fang Fist."" I understand they gave him blonde hair because in the anime his hair is kinda similar to Goou, but you have an asian playing him so I really don't think we'd get them mixed up. The character could have really brought more to the movie, again if there was more time spent training. Yamcha versus nameless minions, and Chi-Chi Vs Mai part 2, woulda have been a great juxtaposition with the Goku vs Piccolo fight.NEEDED WORK-The story. It was an adaptation. Toriyama himself said he saw this as an alternate reality of the universe he created. That being said I didn't have an issue so much with what they changed as how half assed they did things. Everything felt rushed. Gokou pining after a girl didn't bother me so much as the whole cliched, the girl can get him to focus scene. Also the fact that they threw things like Namekians in there but didn't try to actually explain that PICCOLO was Namekian was a little silly. They had all the beats but failed to hit them on time to get an impact. Also alot of the deleted scenes really should have stayed as they illustrate thins a little better. One such example, is when we see Gokou being bullied early in the film. We know he can take these guys apart, but he's made a promise not to fight. His frustration is shown as we see him put his hood up and walk away. What was cut is him trying to remove his bike from under the car, and we see him lift the car, WITH EASE, before the alarm sounds and he let's it go. That would have perfectly shown exactly how much he really is holding back.Like I said I never thought this was a good idea, but people should be happy they got anything at all with what the source material was. If I see it for like $2 somewhere, I'll get it to add to my Guyver live action flicks, and the Street Fighter movie when I get it (The JCVD one), but it was not the train wreck Legend of Chun-Li was, and stayed closer to and resembles the source material better, and was actually enjoyable in some parts.",3,It isn't the Anime...and that may be a good thing!,1249257600,"08 3,

1201605,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B001HN69AE,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[29, 33]","Being unfamiliar with the graphic novels, anime, or video games that have made the Dragonball saga a world-wide sensation, I viewed ""Dragonball: Evolution"" with an open mind, hoping to see the kind of frenetic martial arts, magic, and humor I had enjoyed in ""Mortal Kombat"", a few years back. Well...""Mortal Kombat"" this ain't, and despite the presence of legendary ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" star, Chow Yun-Fat (who must have needed the paycheck), I can't recommend this turkey to anyone over the age of 4!The plot is confusing; thousands (or 2,000) years ago, an insane demon lord, Piccolo (if somebody named me that, I'd be pretty mad, too), and his evil right-hand demon, Ozaru, nearly destroyed the world, until he was bound within the earth by seven sorcerors who gave their lives creating the mystical Dragonball orbs that focused their energies. Now, with a 'blood moon' total solar eclipse approaching, Piccolo (an unrecognizable James Marsters) is somehow free (how he accomplished that isn't explained), and gathering up the Dragonballs (which, together, according to legend, will allow the possessor the fulfillment of one 'perfect' wish). He plans to use it to release Ozaru, and finish what he started, before (uh, if any wish would be granted, why not simply WISH the job to be finished?)Meanwhile, in true ""Karate Kid"" fashion, young Goku (Justin Chatwin) is being trained by his Asian grandfather (Randall Duk Kim) martial arts, and harnassing The Force (oops, I mean, his Ki). Goku's past is unknown to him (to be revealed on his 18th birthday), and to celebrate the birthday, Grandpa gives him a Dragonball (which flashes images of Ozaru to him). Of course, Goku cannot display his formidable skills to his high school classmates (even the hot Asian girl he secretly likes, Chi Chi, played by pretty Jamie Chung). With the violent death of the old man, Goku learns of Piccolo's quest, and races to gather all the Dragonballs, himself, joined by greedy Bulma (Emmy Rossum, who must have needed the paycheck, also), a thief, Yamcha (Joon Park), and happy-go-lucky Master, Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat). The story goes downhill, from here...First the Dragonballs are all-important, then they're not, then Chi Chi is revealed as a martial arts expert, who isn't very formidible, then (with very unimpressive CGI), Goku's 'secret' is revealed, but it turns out IT isn't that essential, anyway. The story keeps building to less-than-overwhelming climaxes, with a finale that had me wondering why I'd stuck with the film so long!The Special Features are so-so (the gag reel is funny, an interview with Justin Chatwin doesn't really provide much more insight than a Google search, and a 'Making of' featurette of the Chi Chi vs. Chi Chi fight scene is informative, although the scene isn't the lynchpin of the movie that it is implied as).""Dragonball: Evolution"" is a poor movie...skip it, you won't be missing anything!",1,"Well, Chow Yun-Fat is in it, anyway...",1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,2928,"['Being', 'unfamiliar', 'graphic', 'novels', 'anime', 'video', 'games', 'have', 'made', 'Dragonball', 'saga', 'world-wide', 'sensation', 'viewed', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'open', 'mind', 'hoping', 'see', 'kind', 'frenetic', 'martial', 'arts', 'magic', 'humor', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Well', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'ai', ""n't"", 'presence', 'legendary', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'star', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'needed', 'paycheck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'turkey', 'anyone', 'age', '4', 'plot', 'confusing', 'thousands', '2,000', 'years', 'ago', 'insane', 'demon', 'lord', 'Piccolo', 'somebody', 'named', ""'d"", 'be', 'pretty', 'mad', 'too', 'evil', 'right-hand', 'demon', 'Ozaru', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'world', 'was', 'bound', 'earth', 'seven', 'sorcerors', 'who', 'gave', 'lives', 'creating', 'mystical', 'Dragonball', 'orbs', 'focused', 'energies', 'Now', ""'blood"", 'moon', 'total', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'approaching', 'Piccolo', 'unrecognizable', 'James', 'Marsters', 'somehow', 'free', 'how', 'accomplished', ""n't"", 'explained', 'gathering', 'up', 'Dragonballs', 'together', 'according', 'legend', 'will', 'allow', 'possessor', 'fulfillment', 'one', ""'perfect"", 'wish', 'use', 'release', 'Ozaru', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'uh', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'granted', 'why', 'not', 'simply', 'WISH', 'job', 'be', 'finished', 'Meanwhile', 'true', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'fashion', 'young', 'Goku', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'being', 'trained', 'Asian', 'grandfather', 'Randall', 'Duk', 'Kim', 'martial', 'arts', 'harnassing', 'Force', 'oops', 'mean', 'Ki', 'Goku', 'past', 'unknown', 'be', 'revealed', '18th', 'birthday', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'Grandpa', 'Dragonball', 'images', 'Ozaru', 'course', 'Goku', 'can', 'not', 'display', 'formidable', 'skills', 'high', 'school', 'classmates', 'even', 'hot', 'Asian', 'girl', 'secretly', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'played', 'pretty', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'violent', 'death', 'old', 'man', 'Goku', 'Piccolo', 'quest', 'races', 'gather', 'Dragonballs', 'joined', 'greedy', 'Bulma', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'needed', 'paycheck', 'also', 'thief', 'Yamcha', 'Joon', 'Park', 'happy-go-lucky', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'story', 'downhill', 'here', 'First', 'Dragonballs', 'are', 'all-important', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'then', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'revealed', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'who', ""n't"", 'very', 'formidible', 'then', 'very', 'unimpressive', 'CGI', 'Goku', ""'secret"", 'revealed', 'out', 'IT', ""n't"", 'essential', 'anyway', 'story', 'building', 'less-than-overwhelming', 'climaxes', 'finale', 'had', 'wondering', 'why', ""'d"", 'stuck', 'film', 'so', 'long', 'Special', 'Features', 'are', 'so-so', 'gag', 'reel', 'funny', 'interview', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', ""n't"", 'really', 'provide', 'much', 'more', 'insight', 'Google', 'search', ""'Making"", 'featurette', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'vs.', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'fight', 'scene', 'informative', 'scene', ""n't"", 'lynchpin', 'movie', 'implied', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'poor', 'movie', 'skip', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'anything']",Dragonball: Evolution

Determined that Hollywood will never get what made those series so great in the first place in the movies.  Dragonball: Evolution is certainly no exception. I was one of those few that remained optimistic about the movie. I'll admit, fans have a right to be upset that the people who made this movie took liberties in making the movie, not adhering to the original DBZ series storyline and whatnot. They also have the right to be unhappy that the production values were pretty low-budget. I, too, was expecting something pretty spectacular in that department as the anime is pretty wild.Yet, even so--on its' own merits, I still thought the movie was entertaining. Personally, I enjoyed it. My thoughts on things are that, if they made this movie exactly like the anime series, it would be pretty pointless. Why would fans even bother to go see it at all. Honestly, I've been a fan of the series since it first aired years ago and I wouldn't see it if it were exactly the same. Second, maybe they didn't have enough money to make the production values any better. I hear tell that a sequel is already in the works.

1201608,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001HN69AE,Caleb Williams,"[4, 12]","The Dragon ball name is something that holds a special place in the hearts of many fans, some die hard and some casual. Those hearts were undoubtedly broken when the announcement of an American made live action adaptation of the anime series was to be made. Whether you enjoy this movie really depends on the context of which you watch it. If you watch it and are a fan of the anime and expect it to match what you would see as the greatness of the anime and comics, then you will be disappointed. If you are not a fan but are still expecting a high octane action packed fantasy film, then you're going to be disappointed again. One way I think you would enjoy this, which is the way I looked at it, is if you don't have high expectations to begin with. That may be an obvious perspective, but given the way Hollywood works, quality films based on a comic and anime legacy such as Dragon ball are just not going to happen.The story focuses on Goku (Justin Chatwin), who seeks out, upon his adoptive grandfather Grandpa Gohan's (Randall Duk Kim) dying request, to find the great Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) and gather all seven Dragon Balls. These seven dragon balls, when brought together allow the one who recites the ancient prayer one ultimate wish. There is a danger that the alien Lord Picolo (James Marsters), who is also on a mission to re-unite the Dragon Balls will succeed in his mission and use his wish to destroy the world. Goku and friends, Bulma (Emmy Rossum), Master Roshi, Yamcha (Joon Park) and love interest Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) embark on the dangerous mission to find all 7 Dragon Balls before Picolo.When you tackle a comic and anime show such as this, there's a tight rope to walk for the director as he has to decide what can be included and what should be dismissed to combine the right level of real life antics with the fantasy nature of the characters and surroundings. There's also a comedy element that the director had to contend with so getting the balance perfect would be a massive challenge. Luckily, the balance worked very well into what was ultimately a light hearted and enjoyable movie for the whole family. Some of the better fight scenes are very well choreographed and take place during the first 45 minutes of the film and actually one of my favourite scenes places Goku outside a house party, being confronted by a gang of thugs and takes them all out without having to touch one of them. It's a scene that is very well shot and choreographed brilliantly to the point where the CGI moments even seem plausible in a reality situation.The special effects, for a $50 million budget were really well and managed to convey the epic feel of the plot. However, one thing I didn't find really worked were the environments and the blending of the physical sets with the CGI expansions don't come together very well and it's obvious where the real set ends and the computer set begins. This detracts a lot from the overall feel of the movie and it's obvious that the lack of detail in the real sets compared to the CGI horizons are how it becomes so revealing.  Justin Chatwin does a capable job of playing the main character of Goku and it's certainly a brave role to take on as it's undoubtedly a character loved by many and he would expectedly receive massive criticism from the loyal fan base regardless of how good he will have been. James Marsters as Picolo is a good villain but the character itself doesn't have enough air time to really judge the acting ability within the role. Chow Yun-Fat is a delightful addition to the movie and he certainly takes on a comic style that makes him a very delightful comic character and a worthy choice as fight trainer.I found this a very enjoyable film and as I'm not even acquainted with the Dragon Ball legacy, I suppose that was why I was able to view this film with casual enjoyment. If you are a fan of the comics and anime there will undoubtedly be a plethora of things you can pick out of this film about why it shouldn't be associated with the original anime and comic. My advice would to be just enjoy it as a light hearted feature and not think too much into it as I guarantee you will enjoy it much more.",4,Enjoyably Light Hearted,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",2009,4197,"['Dragon', 'ball', 'name', 'something', 'special', 'place', 'hearts', 'many', 'fans', 'die', 'hard', 'casual', 'hearts', 'were', 'undoubtedly', 'broken', 'when', 'announcement', 'American', 'made', 'live', 'action', 'adaptation', 'anime', 'series', 'was', 'be', 'made', 'Whether', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'really', 'context', 'watch', 'watch', 'are', 'fan', 'anime', 'expect', 'match', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'greatness', 'anime', 'comics', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'are', 'still', 'expecting', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'packed', 'fantasy', 'film', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'again', 'One', 'way', 'think', 'would', 'enjoy', 'way', 'looked', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'begin', 'may', 'be', 'obvious', 'perspective', 'given', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'works', 'quality', 'films', 'based', 'comic', 'anime', 'legacy', 'such', 'Dragon', 'ball', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'going', 'happen.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'Goku', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'who', 'out', 'adoptive', 'grandfather', 'Grandpa', 'Gohan', 'Randall', 'Duk', 'Kim', 'dying', 'request', 'find', 'great', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'seven', 'Dragon', 'Balls', 'seven', 'dragon', 'balls', 'when', 'brought', 'together', 'one', 'who', 'ancient', 'prayer', 'one', 'ultimate', 'wish', 'danger', 'alien', 'Lord', 'Picolo', 'James', 'Marsters', 'who', 'also', 'mission', 're-unite', 'Dragon', 'Balls', 'will', 'succeed', 'mission', 'use', 'wish', 'destroy', 'world', 'Goku', 'friends', 'Bulma', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'Yamcha', 'Joon', 'Park', 'love', 'interest', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'embark', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'find', '7', 'Dragon', 'Balls', 'Picolo.When', 'tackle', 'comic', 'anime', 'show', 'such', 'tight', 'rope', 'walk', 'director', 'decide', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'included', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'dismissed', 'combine', 'right', 'level', 'real', 'life', 'antics', 'fantasy', 'nature', 'characters', 'surroundings', 'also', 'comedy', 'element', 'director', 'had', 'contend', 'so', 'getting', 'balance', 'perfect', 'would', 'be', 'massive', 'challenge', 'Luckily', 'balance', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'ultimately', 'light', 'hearted', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'better', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'choreographed', 'take', 'place', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'actually', 'one', 'favourite', 'scenes', 'places', 'Goku', 'house', 'party', 'being', 'confronted', 'gang', 'thugs', 'having', 'touch', 'one', 'scene', 'very', 'well', 'shot', 'choreographed', 'brilliantly', 'point', 'where', 'CGI', 'moments', 'even', 'seem', 'plausible', 'reality', 'situation.The', 'special', 'effects', '50', 'million', 'budget', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'managed', 'convey', 'epic', 'feel', 'plot', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'really', 'worked', 'were', 'environments', 'blending', 'physical', 'sets', 'CGI', 'expansions', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'obvious', 'where', 'real', 'set', 'ends', 'computer', 'set', 'lot', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie', 'obvious', 'lack', 'detail', 'real', 'sets', 'compared', 'CGI', 'horizons', 'are', 'how', 'so', 'revealing', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'capable', 'job', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'Goku', 'certainly', 'brave', 'role', 'take', 'undoubtedly', 'character', 'loved', 'many', 'would', 'expectedly', 'receive', 'massive', 'criticism', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'regardless', 'how', 'good', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Picolo', 'good', 'villain', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'air', 'time', 'really', 'judge', 'acting', 'ability', 'role', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'delightful', 'addition', 'movie', 'certainly', 'comic', 'style', 'very', 'delightful', 'comic', 'character', 'worthy', 'choice', 'fight', 'trainer.I', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'acquainted', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'legacy', 'suppose', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'able', 'view', 'film', 'casual', 'enjoyment', 'are', 'fan', 'comics', 'anime', 'there', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'plethora', 'things', 'can', 'pick', 'out', 'film', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'associated', 'original', 'anime', 'comic', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'enjoy', 'light', 'hearted', 'feature', 'not', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'guarantee', 'will', 'enjoy', 'much', 'more']",Dragonball: Evolution

1201610,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001HN69AE,Chris Pandolfi,"[12, 17]","There's surprisingly little evolving going on in ""Dragonball: Evolution."" If anything, it de-evolves, taking an archetypal hero's journey and stripping it down past the bare minimum. So many details are either quickly alluded to or altogether overlooked, which essentially leaves us with a fairly bland action adventure story that throws in a little self-discovery for good measure. Based on the ""Dragon Ball"" graphic novels written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, ""Dragonball: Evolution"" is an airy, innocuous fable with a minimalist plot that doesn't require the audience to use their brains. It's really just an excuse for impressive visual effects and intriguing costume designs, and even then it doesn't quite work because not enough time is spent on them.First, a little back story: During a solar eclipse 2,000 years ago, the evil alien warlord Piccolo (James Marsters) and his henchman, Oozaru, came to Earth with the intent to destroy it. Fortunately, a group of monks were able to imprison Piccolo with the aid of a spell. No one knew what happened to Oozaru, but it seems he's useless without his master's influence. As time goes on, Earth goes back to normal.During this introduction, we also learn about dragonballs, billiard-sized spheres that glow like fire. There are seven in total, and each have a specific number of stars floating over the surface. When all have been collected and brought to a hidden temple, they have the ability to bring forth a magical dragon that can grant one wish.Now, the story proper: We meet a teenage martial arts student named Goku (Justin Chatwin), who's picked on at school and always fumbles his words when around attractive girls. He was raised his whole life by his grandfather, a martial arts instructor named Gohan (Randall Duk Kim). As we meet them, the two are engaged in hand-to-hand combat while balancing on a pair of elevated ropes, which must be some kind of pale reference to the gravity-defying stunts of films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""House of Flying Daggers."" As they fight, they draw strength from their Ki (in other words, they conjure up balls of light out of thin air and hurl them at each other). After the fight, we get a real sense of the film's dialogue; for Goku, this means an awkward series of one liners, and for Gohan, this means hopelessly clich&eacute; proverbs about having faith in yourself. Goku knows nothing about where he came from or why he never knew his parents, although Gohan insists that he'll get all the answers come his eighteenth birthday.And lo and behold, his eighteenth birthday arrives. So does Piccolo, and while we never learn how he managed to escape, we do learn that he plans to track down all seven dragonballs and use them for his own sinister purposes during a solar eclipse. As he flies through the clouds aboard a strange metallic ship, he relies on a young and deadly servant girl named Mai (Eriko Tamura) to actually retrieve the dragonballs, which are apparently scattered all over the world.When Goku inherits a dragonball from his grandfather, it becomes his mission to track down the remaining dragonballs and save the world from total destruction. Along the way, he meets: Muten Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat), the martial arts master who instructed Gohan; the ridiculously named and technologically well-equipped Bulma Briefs (Emmy Rossum, who I remember much more affectionately as Christine from ""The Phantom of the Opera""); and Yamcha (Joon Park) a desert bandit whose sole motivating force is a share of the profits. They're eventually joined by Goku's high school crush, the sweet-natured Chi-Chi (Jamie Cheung), who competes in martial arts tournaments in her spare time.Never once does this movie pause to offer an explanation for anything. For starters, where exactly does this story take place? The exotic temples and village names hint at somewhere in Asia--a nighttime shot of a neon-drenched city skyline suggests Hong Kong. But since there's absolutely no language barrier, not even for an alien that's thousands of years old, it's hard to know for sure. Revealing that Yamcha talks like a surfer dude will probably be of no help, and don't get me started on the fact that the movie was filmed on location in Mexico. Moving on (and I alluded to this earlier), how exactly did Piccolo escape? How did Mai come to be in his service? What exactly is this Capsule Corporation that Bulma works for?The ending is a nightmare unto itself for two very specific reasons: (1) it relies on a plot twist that the story wasn't building up to; (2) it culminates with an act of charity so PG-rated that it's downright anticlimactic. And what of the PG rating? Could that be the reason why a story about the threat of annihilation seems so unthreatening? It's probably the reason why I wasn't able to take Piccolo seriously--his pale green skin, dome-like bald head, and muscular black suit make him look more like a goofy invader from Mars than a frightening warlord from beyond. I know it's the reason why Chow Yun-Fat's dialogue was laughably bad. If there's one thing this man shouldn't have to do, it's recite lines that mention the collectability of a swimsuit magazine. I could be mistaken, but I have a feeling that most audiences will not expect such dialogue from a film like ""Dragonball: Evolution.""",2,Saving the World One Ball at a Time,1240531200,"04 24,

Putting that aside the movie was great, and the effects were awesome.James Marster and Chow Yun-Fat are two of the best actors because they can do just about any role.  They played their characters perfectly as did Justin Chatwin and Emmy Rossum.  This was the perfect coming of age story, about a teenager finding out who he is and deciding his destiny.  Is he only what he was born to be or can he be something greater--better.The only issue I have with this movie was the romance between Goku and Chi Chi, because for me it seemed forced.  Not because the two actors did not have chemistry they did, I just thought it was a little rushed.  Like it was only put in there because they felt he needed to have a love interest.

It was absolutely amazing! Justin Chatwin and James Marsters brought Goku and King Piccolo/Lord Piccolo to life on the big screen! All of the characters looked almost exactly like they did in the cartoon: Goku has spikey hair and wears the orange costume, Lord Piccolo is green, wears a robe, and has antenna-like lines on his head, Bulma has a blue sripe of hair on her head and has her capsule bike, Yamcha has the same hair that he had in the cartoon and has a flying truck as a vehicle, Grandpa Gohan has a power pole and grayish hair, Chi Chi looks the same as she did in the cartoon, Master Roshi wears a Haiwaian shirt, and Mai also looks the same as she did in the cartoon. The people who made the movie couldn't make the animal characters, such as Oolong the pig, Puar the shapeshifting cat, and all of the dinosaurs, due to issues that they probably had with time or problems with computer animation, but the movie is still amazing! They were able to put Lord Piccolo's henchmen in the movie, (they renamed them the Fu Lum henchmen) although they don't look the same and they aren't named the same way (Piano, Tambourine, Drum, and Cymbal aren't in the movie) but they look like they're mutated (some of them have three eyes, crab-like claws, etc.) and they can regenerate. Mai still has the airship from the cartoon, Master Roshi has the jar that he tried to put King Piccolo/Lord Piccolo in in the cartoon, and the Dragon Balls are in the movie too. The special effects are incredible! They were able to have Goku and Lord Piccolo fly around in the air just like in the cartoon and the energy blasts/energy beams are incredible too! It seems like the creators of the movie took them straight from the cartoon and put them on the movie screen, especially with the Kamehameha Wave! The comedic tone of the cartoon is maintained in the movie too, like when Goku fights Master Roshi when he says, ""I am Master Roshi the Invincible! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"" or when Goku, Bulma, Yamcha, and Master Roshi are looking for another Dragon Ball and Yamcha accidently sits on an erupting geyser, and in many other parts of the movie. Also, the special effects for when Goku transforms into the Oozaru giant Saiyan monkey are amazing, too! I loved this movie and I can't wait to get it on DVD when it comes out on July 28 of this year!

In actuality, the thing that crossed my mind was, ""how could a high school in the suburbs be close to a secluded hut on top of a hill where Goku lived""?  I don't understand the inclusion of having a high-school setting in the first place; as a Dragonball enthusiast, that seems more suited for a character like Gohan.  Gohan went to high-school and he goes through the same awkward stages like Justin Chatwin's character.  In fact, Chatwin acted more like Gohan than Goku: Goku has always been a naive but kind-hearted character with a large appetite, not nebbish and cowardice towards girls like Chatwin portrayed. His love-interest, Chi-Chi, is more of a flirt than a hot-tempered lady of the original and thus is a lot less interested.  The actors don't seem too thrilled with their performances, with the exception of Chow Yun-Fat who manages to mantain his Muten Roshi character with most of the original perversion and radical temperament intact.If anyone doesn't know what the Dragon Ball series is about, the you'll be completely flabbergasted by how contrived and ridiculous the whole movie sets up, but even if one's an avid Dragon Ball fan, the plot for ""Dragonball Evolution"" still wouldn't make sense.  It narrates about an evil nemesis named Piccolo who's a destroyer of planets alongside a giant ape, until he was locked in a cage but he was uncaged and is off to follow his clich&eacute;.  The film never bothered to explain how he got out, it's just an excuse to drive the ""stop the big big"" plot for Goku to go on the merry journey, as well as finding the dragonball with help of his allies. Who is that woman Piccolo's hanging with and how did they meet?  There's an explanation among elders about Goku's eighteenth birthday and how it relates to the plot, but how would the elders know about it?  How come the missing dragon balls are so close to each other in the search?  Other plot-related questions that I can't spoil, but the point is almost every situation seemed to be set-up simply out of convenience without any kind of logical explanation behind them.If I have anything good to say, the fight scenes aren't bad, although the climatic showdown between Goku and Piccolo ended on a total letdown.  But when it comes to a paper-full-of-holes plot, boring characters, and cartoony effects, saying ""fights aren't bad"" isn't good enough.  It's just another lousy effort on a live-action anime adaptation.",2,KameHAmeha?,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,2644,"['Talk', 'absurdity', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'due', 'most', 'powerful', 'being', 'Earth', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'getting', 'ridiculous', 'hand-me-down', 'bullies', 'was', 'watched', 'scene', 'straight-faced', 'actuality', 'thing', 'crossed', 'mind', 'was', 'how', 'could', 'high', 'school', 'suburbs', 'be', 'close', 'secluded', 'hut', 'top', 'hill', 'where', 'Goku', 'lived', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'inclusion', 'having', 'high-school', 'setting', 'first', 'place', 'Dragonball', 'enthusiast', 'more', 'suited', 'character', 'Gohan', 'Gohan', 'went', 'high-school', 'same', 'awkward', 'stages', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'character', 'fact', 'Chatwin', 'acted', 'more', 'Gohan', 'Goku', 'Goku', 'always', 'been', 'naive', 'kind-hearted', 'character', 'large', 'appetite', 'not', 'nebbish', 'cowardice', 'towards', 'girls', 'Chatwin', 'portrayed', 'love-interest', 'Chi-Chi', 'more', 'flirt', 'hot-tempered', 'lady', 'original', 'thus', 'lot', 'less', 'interested', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'thrilled', 'performances', 'exception', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'who', 'mantain', 'Muten', 'Roshi', 'character', 'most', 'original', 'perversion', 'radical', 'temperament', 'intact.If', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'series', ""'ll"", 'be', 'completely', 'flabbergasted', 'how', 'contrived', 'ridiculous', 'whole', 'movie', 'up', 'even', 'one', 'avid', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'fan', 'plot', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'evil', 'nemesis', 'named', 'Piccolo', 'who', 'destroyer', 'planets', 'alongside', 'giant', 'ape', 'was', 'locked', 'cage', 'was', 'uncaged', 'off', 'follow', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'never', 'bothered', 'explain', 'how', 'got', 'out', 'just', 'excuse', 'drive', 'stop', 'big', 'big', 'plot', 'Goku', 'go', 'merry', 'journey', 'as', 'well', 'finding', 'dragonball', 'help', 'allies', 'Who', 'woman', 'Piccolo', 'hanging', 'how', 'did', 'meet', 'explanation', 'elders', 'Goku', 'eighteenth', 'birthday', 'how', 'plot', 'how', 'would', 'elders', 'know', 'How', 'come', 'missing', 'dragon', 'balls', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'other', 'search', 'Other', 'plot-related', 'questions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'point', 'almost', 'situation', 'seemed', 'be', 'set-up', 'simply', 'convenience', 'kind', 'logical', 'explanation', 'them.If', 'have', 'anything', 'good', 'say', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'climatic', 'showdown', 'Goku', 'Piccolo', 'ended', 'total', 'letdown', 'when', 'paper-full-of-holes', 'plot', 'boring', 'characters', 'cartoony', 'effects', 'saying', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'just', 'lousy', 'effort', 'live-action', 'anime', 'adaptation']",Dragonball: Evolution
1201619,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001HN69AE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","""Dragon Ball"", a series that many fans in Japan and all over the world have looked at the manga (Japanese comic books), anime (Japanese animation) and its characters as passionately as those who have grown up with iconic superheroes as Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and the X-Men.Needless, to say that ""Dragonball"", may it be the original, ""Dragonball Z"" or even ""Dragonball GT"" are still series that no matter how many years have passed since the manga/anime/video games were released in Japan and even worldwide, continues to make money and its fandom continues to grow.Whenever a passionate series is discussed about being brought over to a live action film, this is where directors, screenwriters and casting need to be fully aware of the rabid fandom out there.  Granted, no one is expecting a 100% complete translation from series to live-action film but most often at times, the producers and the director try to listen to fans as best as they can (ie. films like ""Transformers"", ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"").Here we are with ""Dragonball Evolution"", produced by popular HK filmmaker and star Stephen Chow (""Shaolin Soccer"", ""Kung Fu Hustle"", ""CJ7', ""A Chinese Odyssey"", etc.) a film directed by James Wong (""Final Destination"", ""The Others"", ""The One"" and episodes of ""The X-Files"" and ""Millenium""), a screenplay by Ben Ramsey (""The Big Hit"" and ""Love and Bullet""), music by Brian Tyler (""Eagle Eye"", ""Fast & Furious"", ""Bangkok Dangerous"", etc.) and cinematography by Robert McLachlan (""Final Destination"", ""Bionic Woman"", ""Harper's Island"", etc.).The film would star Justin Chatwin (""War of the Worlds"" and ""Traffic""), Chow Yun-Fat (""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), Emmy Rossum (""Mystic River"", ""Poseidon"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow""), Jamie Chung (""Princess Protection Program"", ""Samurai Girl"" and ""Greek""), James Marsters (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"" and ""Smallville""), Eriko Tamura (""Heroes"" and ""Reaper"") and Randall Duk Kim (""The Lost Empire"", ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" and ""The Replacement Killers"").VIDEO & AUDIO:This is the area where Twentieth Century Fox has been on top when it comes to Blu-ray releases.  Near perfect picture and audio quality.  How does ""Dragonball Evolution: Z Edition"" fare?The film features a 1080p (2:40:1) High Definition transfer with AVC @ 33.5 MBPS.  There is a creative approach in the type of look that Robert McLachlan brought to film.  For one, the colors are quite vibrant and the film features a lot of detail.  But there are some scenes that are given a bright, dreamy look at times.  There are scenes that just look very impressive in high definition and the effects such as the Dragon Ball glowing, the detail on the rocks, clothing and also skin of the characters.The transfer reveals above-average levels of detail in almost nearly every shot.  Eye popping colors, details on textures... the picture quality of ""Dragonball Evolution"" is actually fantastic.  There are some scenes where CG and stuntwork, seem a bit out of place.  For example, there is a scene where Goku has to hop during a lava sequence that just didn't seem right.  Also, Goku's transformation to the ape... it just seemed off.  And it would have been nice to see some added height, I know they can't go too big on the ape like in the manga/anime series but the visual effects for the ape seemed off for me.  But that's my personal opinion.As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (Spanish, French and Portuguese are offered in 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The audio for this film is also very well done.  Dialog is crisp and clear. Although I found myself rewinding dialogue by Yamcha (Joon Park) and having to turn on English subtitles to figure out what he is saying at times.  Bass is heavy and deep and the action sequences, in which there are many, and audio just fills up the soundstage.  From blasts to countless destruction, your home theater system from all channels will be put to work.  In fact, I felt immersed with audio around me that it was so constant that my wife who is usually tolerable to my audio tests, felt that I was overdoing it.  I wasn't overdoing it, this is how the film's audio was.  There are scenes with constant sound effects that was balanced with a pretty good musical score by Brian Tyler.So, needless to say, two highlights of this Blu-ray release is the audio and picture quality.Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Dragonball Evolution: Z Edition"" comes with the following special features:** Goku's Workout Featurette - (4:50) Two guys showing us how Goku fights and learning to punch, to kick and the proper stance.* Goku's Quest Game - Watch the film again and press the red button on your Blu-ray player remote when you see a dragon ball.  Try to find all seven.* Deleted Scenes - (11:08) A total of eight deleted scenes.  There are actually a few scenes that the director and editor should have kept in the film in my opinion.* Brian Anthony ""Worked Up"" Music Video - (3:21) An electronic music video for Brian Anthony's ""Worked Up"".  This was surprising because even for those of us following the film, the music that a lot of fans were looking forward to is the ""Rule"" by Japanese mega pop star (who has a tremendous following worldwide), Ayumi Hamasaki.  The song had a huge promotion in Japan (the music was used in the film when Goku was attending school) and people worldwide purchased the CD single because Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama had involvement with that release.  Personally, I wish there was an Ayumi Hamasaki music video included and probably would have brought her hardcore fans into buying this Blu-ray.* Fox Movie Channel presents Making a Scene - (9:27) The making of the good Chi Chi vs. evil Chi Chi scene.  The training that Jamie Chung had to go through for this scene and how challenging it was to make it work.  If anything, my mind started zeroing in on how many times the name ""Chi Chi"" would come up during this featurette.* Fox Movie Channel presents Life After Film School with Justin Chatwin - (24:57) Three film students interview Justin Chatwin in regards to becoming an actor, working on ""War of the Worlds"" and him observing Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, wanting to be challenged with this role and his interesting definition of ""manga"".  Also, interesting was Chatwin's response in regards to his friend going on a Dragon Ball website and telling him that everyone hated him.  Suffice to say, a very interesting featurette.* Gag Reel - (2:20) Behind-the-scenes fun with the talent and film crew.The Blu-ray release includes two discs.  The second disc includes a digital copy of ""Dragonball Evolution"".JUDGMENT CALL:I am a passionate fan of the series and the video games.  When I was younger, I would buy Japanese ""Shonen Jump"" and use it as a way to study Japanese and would save up to buy the import SNES video game when it came out and rent Japanese VHS from the Japanese rental store (which was quite far) to pick up the latest episodes of the ""Dragon Ball Z"" in Japan.  Needless to say, I'm a fan but at the same time, I know that I had to leave my passion out the door and look at this film as something fresh and new.  To see how much of the original series or its characters were incorporated into the film.Having seen the Chinese version of ""Dragon Ball Z"" which was horrible, I figured that this film couldn't get any horrible as that film and most importantly, I was more curious how a big budget can lend itself to the feel of the ""Dragon Ball"" universe and its characters.  How much from the original they can incorporate to this film.  Because simply, films like ""Transformers"", ""X-Men"", ""Batman"", ""Spider-Man"", series based on a comic or animated-series that have been made to a live-action film, there are always going to be changes.I'll start off what I liked about the film.  I enjoyed Emmy Rossum's Bulma.  Spunky, talkative and cute.  Chow Yun-Fat is a big name that brings people out to the theater's and his Master Roshi managed to capture some of that perverseness of the old man.  James Marsters as Piccolo was also fine (although he is missing his antenna's) and Joon Park's Yamcha, a bit more surfer dude but in a way, resembled the FUNimation Entertainment English dub character quite a bit.  Were these the right people cast for the film?  If you wanted manga or anime faithfulness, fans will definitely cry fowl.  But there were parts from the manga and anime series in the film and it was enjoyable to see those parts.Justin Chatwin as Goku was a bit difficult for me to accept.  Fans know Goku to be a small character in the manga, the fact that this film features Gohan as a teenager (which is more in line with Gohan ala DBZ and Goten ala DBGT), needless to say that fans have cried fowl.  Even Asians had online protest of why the character is not Asian.But other problems that I had with the film such as acting, pacing, visual effects and its screenplay.  Justin Chatwin used samurai's as reference for Dragon Ball especially in the special features in regards to the clothing and preparing for the role.  And I was asking myself why?  There was also the over utilization of the term ""air bending"" in the film which I can understand for those who know ki and bending of air for energy in Asia but for those who watched a ""Dragon Ball"" film, ""air bending"" is not a term typically used.  People are used to hearing more of ""kamehameha"" or even ""Kaio-ken for Gohan. And instead of focusing on the ""Dragon Ball"" dynamics, we somehow we get ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" in the film.And speaking of special moves, let's discuss the final battle.  Goku and Piccolo are like Rocky vs. Apollo, Annakin vs. Obi Wan, Superman vs. General Zod and Wolverine vs. Sabretooth.  There has to be a good build up.  A show of rivalry and a believable fighting scene between both characters.  ""Dragon Ball"" is known for its fighting sequences and I felt that ending battle was just too short and so unsatisfying that if the final battle was done well, it could have made a difference.  The Dragon Ball mystique of Goku is the hero who seems as if he's getting beaten and looks as if he is losing in battle until he finds the opponents weakness and takes advantage of that weakness, comes back and beats the hell out of opponent.  Needless to say, the ending battle to the film was poorly done, I was disappointed.As for the Blu-ray release, this is a perfect example of a film that has awesome picture quality and audio quality and has received a wonderful Blu-ray transfer but the film is unable to match that quality.In the end, if there is plans for a sequel, there has to be significant changes to win the fans over again.  It's one thing of wanting to incorporate teenage life, romance and fighting (""Karate Kid"" is a great example of a film that manages to capture that and also include a satisfying ending fight scene) but somehow this film never reached its full potential of being a good film that would satisfy the fans or the non-fans.By no means is this a terrible movie, but even having to leave my appreciation and passion for ""Dragon Ball"" out the door and knowing that the film would be quite different, I just felt the film missed its ultimate potential.",2,Blu-ray: The good news is that the Blu-ray sports awesome picture and audio quality.

No hate, just not a fan.So when I saw ""Dragonball: Evolution,"" all I knew about the series was what I gleaned from wikis and Abridged Series... and I STILL found plenty to mock and criticize. This movie is an incoherent mess with no real motivations or plot -- fans will be frothing at the mouth at the stuff it changes, and non-fans will be completely baffled.On his eighteenth birthday, high-school outcast/martial artist Goku (Justin Chatwin) is given a magical Dragonball by his grandfather Gohan (Randall Duk Kim). But when he returns home from a party, Goku finds that Gohan has been murdered by the evil demon Piccolo (James Marsters), who is trying to gather all the Dragonballs so he can... do something.Like any good Obi-Wan, Gohan's dying message is to find somebody to finish Goku's training. So Goku joins forces with the eccentric Master Roshi (Chow-Yun Fat), along with the Dragonball-obsessed Bulma Briefs (Emmy Rossum) and desert bandit Yamcha (Joon Park). This little group must gather all the Dragonballs before the eclipse, or Piccolo will... do something.""Dragonball Evolution"" is a great example of why live adaptations of anime don't turn out well -- not faithful enough to satisfy Dragonball fans, but too esoteric for newcomers. But even if that weren't true, the movie would still be a mess -- it feels like nobody cared enough to do more than slap everything hastily together.Almost nothing is explained (like Piccolo's motives). Instead it just coasts along, hoping that the splashes of CGI and wacky acting will distract you from the incoherent plot. And in a futile attempt to appeal to teenagers, it inserts random High School Wangst, in a baffling subplot that has Goku being bullied and mooning after Chi-Chi.I'd also like to mention that it has several characters that have no reason to be in this movie except... well, that they existed in the manga. Ernie Hudson, Emmy Rossum, Joon Park and Jamie Chung all do decent jobs, but they are utterly wasted.And the actors who AREN'T superfluous are totally wasted too. Chow Yun-fat acts like he's gone off his bipolar meds, although there's a certain hammy charm in his performance. And Poor James Marsters is stuck in green makeup, with no motivation except ""Piccolo's evil! And he wants the Dragonballs for... uh... no reason!""And Chatwin? The less said about him, the better. He's your typical pouting teen loser who Doesn't Fit In, which makes him an awful lead character.""Dragonball Evolution"" is a prime example of why Hollywood should stay far, far away from anime and manga -- a baffling, annoying slagheap that won't make anyone happy.",1,KamehameBLAH,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,2731,"['Disclaimer', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Dragonball', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'other', 'things', 'having', 'do', 'Dragonballs', 'No', 'hate', 'just', 'not', 'fan.So', 'when', 'saw', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'knew', 'series', 'was', 'what', 'gleaned', 'wikis', 'Abridged', 'Series', 'STILL', 'found', 'plenty', 'mock', 'criticize', 'movie', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'real', 'motivations', 'plot', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'stuff', 'non-fans', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'eighteenth', 'birthday', 'high-school', 'outcast/martial', 'artist', 'Goku', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'given', 'magical', 'Dragonball', 'grandfather', 'Gohan', 'Randall', 'Duk', 'Kim', 'when', 'home', 'party', 'Goku', 'Gohan', 'been', 'murdered', 'evil', 'demon', 'Piccolo', 'James', 'Marsters', 'who', 'trying', 'gather', 'Dragonballs', 'can', 'do', 'something.Like', 'good', 'Obi-Wan', 'Gohan', 'dying', 'message', 'find', 'somebody', 'finish', 'Goku', 'training', 'So', 'Goku', 'joins', 'forces', 'eccentric', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'Chow-Yun', 'Fat', 'Dragonball-obsessed', 'Bulma', 'Briefs', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'desert', 'bandit', 'Yamcha', 'Joon', 'Park', 'little', 'group', 'must', 'gather', 'Dragonballs', 'eclipse', 'Piccolo', 'will', 'do', 'something', 'Evolution', 'great', 'example', 'why', 'live', 'adaptations', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'not', 'faithful', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'Dragonball', 'fans', 'too', 'esoteric', 'newcomers', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'true', 'movie', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'mess', 'nobody', 'cared', 'enough', 'do', 'more', 'slap', 'everything', 'hastily', 'together.Almost', 'nothing', 'explained', 'Piccolo', 'motives', 'Instead', 'just', 'along', 'hoping', 'splashes', 'CGI', 'wacky', 'acting', 'will', 'distract', 'incoherent', 'plot', 'futile', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'teenagers', 'random', 'High', 'School', 'Wangst', 'baffling', 'subplot', 'Goku', 'being', 'bullied', 'mooning', 'Chi-Chi.I', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'mention', 'several', 'characters', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'movie', 'well', 'existed', 'manga', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Joon', 'Park', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'do', 'decent', 'jobs', 'are', 'utterly', 'actors', 'who', 'ARE', ""N'T"", 'superfluous', 'are', 'totally', 'wasted', 'too', 'Chow', 'Yun-fat', 'acts', 'gone', 'off', 'bipolar', 'meds', 'certain', 'hammy', 'charm', 'performance', 'Poor', 'James', 'Marsters', 'stuck', 'green', 'makeup', 'motivation', 'Piccolo', 'evil', 'Dragonballs', 'uh', 'reason', 'Chatwin', 'less', 'said', 'better', 'typical', 'pouting', 'teen', 'loser', 'who', ""n't"", 'Fit', 'awful', 'lead', 'character', 'Evolution', 'prime', 'example', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'anime', 'manga', 'baffling', 'annoying', 'slagheap', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'anyone', 'happy']",Dragonball: Evolution

Still I feel the two cents burning a hole in my pocket. It must be said....This film succeeds quite well in breathing life into anime. To put it better, I've never seen such a film that turns actors into anime characters. And frankly dumb characters at that. The story is...blah blah blah. The most fun I had was watching Gokku pretending to be...Japanese? If I were Japanese I'd be insulted. Watching his grandfather, Wandering Meadows (it's a joke), reporting back from Ghostland was even better.The wicked waste here was Chow Yun-fat. I thought he had lost his mind for doing BULLETPROOF MONK, but I think this film proves he's certifiable writ large. If he don't get a REAL master role soon, I'm giving up on him altogether.Observe the dragon's balls. How like mini-bowling balls they are, and what memories they brought back to me. Ah, I wasn't a bad bowler, and suddenly it struck me that this film is exactly that: bowling. You train, you hunt for balls but of course you have that one ball that you adore and always use. You have to. Then you meet up with some damned ugly competition and have to bowl a perfect score or drink til you die, or something to that effect. Ah the good old days.And sadly, I don't think a film ought to do this sort of thing to a viewer. And where was the little Shao-lin monk? Or do I have the wrong cartoon? I agree with Stephen Colbert: if you're going to make films based on old cartoons and video games, do them justice by going back in time.

1201623,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001HN69AE,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 4]","DRAGONBALL EVOLUTIONI have always been a fan of the Manga series Dragonball by Akira Toriyama and each series afterwards like Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT. I liked the written formats and the animes as well so I was excited when this live action film was announced. I was let down a bit when the trailer was released but I never judge without seeing something first. I missed the theatrical release because of reasons unknown to myself, as I did not know when it was out [limited I think could be wrong]. So when the DVD was released I had to see it so off I went with my girl and brother and sat down to hopefully enjoy.Goku is just a normal every day average young man who has trouble fitting in and getting the girl of his dreams, and can fight like crazy. That of course is his only thing he has going for him but even then his grandfather can whoop him. Any way one day he is invited to Chi Chi's house for a party by her, the girl of his dreams. So after sneaking out and skipping on his tradition he does with his grandpa on his birthday he makes his way to Chi Chi's. Upon arriving a group of guys that usually pick on him are there to continue the torment, until he decides to teach them a lesson, with out throwing a blow. While doing this and impressing Chi Chi his grandfather is attacked by Piccolo an alien who is far more powerful than he is. Piccolo is after the Dragonballs and will stop at nothing to get them including killing all those who are in the way.So after returning home Goku learns of this and is told by his dying grandfather to find a Master Roshi. From there Roshi can help him keep the Dragonballs safe and teach him to fight Piccolo. This journey to save the world will lead him on a crazy adventure that introduces him to characters such as the lovely Bulma and a guy named Yamcha. All three with the help of Master Roshi set out to find the Dragonballs and stop Piccolo before he can summon another creature that threatens the world.Well even though that all sounds good the truth of the matter is it really is not the awesome extravaganza that it should have been. This film when first announced had me all kinds of crazy hyped, because for some reason I though they would take this serious enough to make it great. I can understand changing some things for the feature film to make it appeal to a wider audience but there are some things in this that are just, well not good shall we say. Director James Wong as taken a lot of flack for this film and for the most part rightly so, because as the team captain he should have been all over the mistakes in this. The direction at times feels uneven and at others a bit rushed if that makes any sense. At least the action is good but the biggest mistake is the fact that the final battle with Piccolo is way to short. Piccolo is a bad dude and at least they made him look cool in this even though the fight at the end could have been better.Ben Ramsey messed up with this one; I don't know why he wrote it like this because he has done much better. He directed a recent film that I though was great called ""Blood & Bone"" and wrote one of my favorite films called ""The Big Hit"". Don't know what he was doing on this one, but oh well I guess. Acting wise this is also a mixed bag because all perform fine at some points and are off at others. Lead Justin Chatwin as Goku falls right into that category doing ok at times and not so much at others. Same can be said for Emmy Rossum as Bulma and Joon Park as Yamcha. Yun-Fat Chow however is good as Master Roshi and does not miss a beat, and Eriko Tamura is great in this as well [and easy to look at]. Randall Duk Kim is good as Goku's grandfather and James Marsters is great as Piccolo.Now to be honest with you this film is kinda entertaining if you watch it with absolutely no expectations what so ever. For any one whom as know clue about the source material for this or any thing related to it I a pretty sure you would enjoy this. This is a popcorn flick for sure nothing but pure entertainment for those who no nothing about it. For those like myself who do know a thing or two about the source material it is kind of frustrating to see this film made like this. Still for those like me who do know turn off expectations and look at it like it is just another flick and it is halfway decent.Recommend for those who I have mentioned above and a turn off you r brain for this one, mindless fun at best.",3,3 STARS IF YOU TURN YOUR BRAIN OFF,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,4439,"['DRAGONBALL', 'EVOLUTIONI', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Manga', 'series', 'Dragonball', 'Akira', 'Toriyama', 'series', 'afterwards', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'Dragonball', 'GT', 'liked', 'written', 'formats', 'animes', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'bit', 'when', 'trailer', 'was', 'released', 'never', 'judge', 'seeing', 'something', 'first', 'missed', 'theatrical', 'release', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'myself', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'when', 'was', 'out', '[', 'limited', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', ']', 'So', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'see', 'so', 'went', 'girl', 'brother', 'sat', 'down', 'hopefully', 'enjoy.Goku', 'just', 'normal', 'day', 'average', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'getting', 'girl', 'dreams', 'can', 'fight', 'crazy', 'course', 'only', 'thing', 'going', 'even', 'then', 'grandfather', 'can', 'whoop', 'way', 'one', 'day', 'invited', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'house', 'party', 'girl', 'dreams', 'So', 'sneaking', 'out', 'skipping', 'tradition', 'grandpa', 'birthday', 'way', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'arriving', 'group', 'guys', 'usually', 'pick', 'are', 'there', 'continue', 'torment', 'teach', 'lesson', 'out', 'throwing', 'blow', 'doing', 'impressing', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'grandfather', 'attacked', 'Piccolo', 'alien', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'Piccolo', 'Dragonballs', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'including', 'killing', 'who', 'are', 'way.So', 'returning', 'home', 'Goku', 'told', 'dying', 'grandfather', 'find', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'Roshi', 'can', 'help', 'keep', 'Dragonballs', 'safe', 'teach', 'fight', 'Piccolo', 'journey', 'save', 'world', 'will', 'lead', 'crazy', 'adventure', 'characters', 'such', 'lovely', 'Bulma', 'guy', 'named', 'Yamcha', 'three', 'help', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'Dragonballs', 'stop', 'Piccolo', 'can', 'summon', 'creature', 'world.Well', 'even', 'sounds', 'good', 'truth', 'matter', 'really', 'not', 'awesome', 'extravaganza', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'announced', 'had', 'kinds', 'crazy', 'hyped', 'reason', 'would', 'take', 'serious', 'enough', 'make', 'great', 'can', 'understand', 'changing', 'things', 'feature', 'film', 'make', 'appeal', 'wider', 'audience', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'well', 'not', 'good', 'shall', 'say', 'Director', 'James', 'Wong', 'taken', 'lot', 'flack', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'rightly', 'so', 'team', 'captain', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'mistakes', 'direction', 'times', 'feels', 'uneven', 'others', 'bit', 'rushed', 'sense', 'least', 'action', 'good', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'fact', 'final', 'battle', 'Piccolo', 'way', 'short', 'Piccolo', 'bad', 'dude', 'least', 'made', 'look', 'cool', 'even', 'fight', 'end', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Ben', 'Ramsey', 'messed', 'up', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'wrote', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'directed', 'recent', 'film', 'though', 'was', 'great', 'called', 'Blood', 'Bone', 'wrote', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'called', 'Big', 'Hit', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'one', 'oh', 'well', 'guess', 'Acting', 'wise', 'also', 'mixed', 'bag', 'perform', 'fine', 'points', 'are', 'off', 'others', 'Lead', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Goku', 'right', 'category', 'doing', 'ok', 'times', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'others', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Bulma', 'Joon', 'Park', 'Yamcha', 'Yun-Fat', 'Chow', 'however', 'good', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'not', 'miss', 'beat', 'Eriko', 'Tamura', 'great', 'as', 'well', '[', 'easy', 'look', ']', 'Randall', 'Duk', 'Kim', 'good', 'Goku', 'grandfather', 'James', 'Marsters', 'great', 'Piccolo.Now', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'kinda', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'absolutely', 'expectations', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'one', 'whom', 'know', 'clue', 'source', 'material', 'thing', 'related', 'pretty', 'sure', 'would', 'enjoy', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'sure', 'nothing', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'who', 'nothing', 'like', 'myself', 'who', 'do', 'know', 'thing', 'two', 'source', 'material', 'kind', 'frustrating', 'see', 'film', 'made', 'Still', 'who', 'do', 'know', 'turn', 'off', 'expectations', 'look', 'just', 'flick', 'halfway', 'decent.Recommend', 'who', 'have', 'mentioned', 'turn', 'off', 'r', 'brain', 'one', 'mindless', 'fun', 'best']",Dragonball: Evolution

So what does it say about a movie when, in talking about it, you open with the caveat: ""If you'd just lower your expectations...""? DRAGONBALL: EVOLUTION happens to fall (plummet?) into this awkward category. Me, I know diddly squat about Dragonball or Dragonball Z, other than they feature dudes with funky spiky hair (but don't all animes?). So I walked into the theater with not much of a preconceived notion. Then I walked out, shaking my head and thinking that this film sucketh more than my working girl pal Back Alley Sally (down at the corner of Hollywood and Vine; she takes coupons).I knew I was in for a horrible when, in the early moments, the camera cuts to a bead of sweat dripping in meaningful slow motion from some guy's nose. Then it's on to the petulant teen getting martial arts instruction from his adoptive Asian grandfather. Young Son Goku (Justin Chatwin) is well-versed in assskickery but he's been self-controlled all his life and allows his school mates to rag and bully him. Things change on his 18th birthday, when his grandfather presents him with an odd orange orb called a dragon ball and tells him there are only six others like it.Shockingly (but not really) the grandfather is murdered, and then it's on for the quest to save the world. Two thousand years ago the world was nearly destroyed by the otherworldy menaces Lord Piccolo and his disciple Ozaru. Now Lord Piccolo is back, all green and destructive and vaguely looking like that smoldering English vampire from BUFFY. The only way to stop him is for Goku to gather all the dragon balls, at which point a dragon emerges to grant one perfect wish. Along the way, Goku picks up folks to help him. Emmy Rossum is miscast and just sounds wrong as the beautiful inventor Bulma. Chow Yun-Fat, embarrassingly over-the-top, shows up in a Hawaiian shirt as Goku's mentor, Master Roshi, and Pat Morita really needs to climb out of his grave to slap the sifu out of him. Somewhere, I can feel John Woo carefully distancing himself. And there's some unmemorable young Asian guy playing a mercenary-minded bad boy. I'm frankly startled the world got saved.I'll say this, the martial arts stuff is fairly cool (Chatwin's stunt double has got mad skills), and I even dug the near futuristic setting. And that pretty much sums up stuff that I liked. There's much here that's incoherent and painful and just dang silly. Philosophical conceits get bandied about, leading to irritatingly cryptic lines like ""To be at one with myself, I must be two."" DRAGONBALL: EVOLUTION is what happens when Hollywood goes the cynical ""Let's just cash in, eff the fans"" route. As mentioned, I don't know much about the original manga and the anime version, but I have friends who went all howling apenuts about this movie. They were pretty cheesed. But, strictly as a movie goer, I say there are other things to slam, putting to the side the extreme dis to Dragon Ball's manga mythos and continuity.The biggest detractor is the acting. It's as if all the actors involved knew going in that this was already a lost cause and so just didn't bring their best mojo. Justin Chatwin is... not good. I had qualms when I first learned that they'd cast a white dude for the part of Goku. It's like Scott Wolf in DOUBLE DRAGON all over again, in the sense that the guy is just totally wrong for the part. Justin Chatwin has the charisma of my third toenail. And his line delivery is so wooden that even William Shatner is saying, ""Oh, hell, no!"" (""My grandfather is dead. He.. was murdered. I... will... avenge him."").I have no wish to dis on James Marsters, who was so awesome as Spike. But he's so bogged down here by shoddy dialogue and layers of green make-up that he never had a chance.The only one who leaves a good impression is that Asian girl who plays Chi Chi, Goku's love interest. It's a good thing her hotness supersedes her character's crappalicious name. When I think of a name like ""Chi Chi,"" images of ugly little poodles and old Puerto Rican pro golfers come up, and I'm not turned on.It's amusing in a way that one of the dragon balls just so happens to be in the hole that Goku and pals had fallen into. And then, sooner than you'd think, it's like the film writers, I guess feeling that even their slapdash approach requires too much effort, just gave up and called it a day because, out of the blue, Bulma informs the rest that Piccolo had just gotten a hold of the remaining four dragon balls. Ta-da! No more scurrying around looking for dragon balls! This quest sucks!

I am a huge Dragonball fan and it has nothing to offer the fans of the series. As for new people watching it I would still go against it. So Goku is being trained by Gohan who found him in his yard trying to prepare him for the possible return of Piccolo who is from the planet Namek and according to this movie all Nameks are evil. When Goku turns 18 he has the possibility of changing into a demon named Osaru which is his great ape form. Goku never has a tail in this movie period. Everyone he meets knows martial arts in this movie except for Bulma and Yamcha. Bulma makes inventions still, but other than that she is a complete idiot. I don't get how she makes anything in the movie. The Dragon Radar also got changed to the DBE for Dragon Ball Energy. The ancient Dragon Balls also seem to have no rhyme or reason for how they actually ended up on the planet. Oh finally Goku could become the Avatar since the Kamehameha in this movie is a form of airbending though it can light things on fire.So I mentioned why you should avoid it so far just by being a fan of the original series. Well the plot makes no sense. Osaru and Piccolo were defeated 2,000 years ago and now Piccolo is on a rampage looking for the Dragon Balls. They don't explain how Piccolo returned and Osaru came from the sky 18 years ago so he just happens to be their to help. Osaru as mentioned above is Goku, but they don't really explain why he has a human form at all. He can only change during a Solar Eclipse which is a rare event and if he isn't in his Osaru form, well he's a good guy. That means his transformation should only last a limited time at best. Goku however can fight the transformation which also is not really explained well, but you see him just change back because he wants to. The acting is horrible and if they stuck with the original story were Goku is only 12, a 12 year old could have done a better job. Bulma's actress is by far the worse of the actors in the movie and she even sounds like an idiot. She also doesn't have any common sense and yet she has like a Phd and all of this other stuff in the movie.Just do yourself a favor even if you are just curious about how bad this movie is and don't watch it. If someone asks you too and it's free to watch it once, don't do it. I got that opportunity and I still feel like I was ripped off.

You're better off not wasting your money in theaters and just watching it on-line. It's not even worth wasting money to rent it. Sure, I didn't see the whole movie but I saw enough to know that it was bad.I was a big Dragonball Z fan and I really wish they made more of an effort in starting a movie series. The movie got the quirkiness of the series right but...that's about it.The movie has horrible costumes, stupid action sequences and bad set pieces. While  Justin Chatwin is just painful to watch as Goku. He's annoying, can't act and he looks like a fan that just played dress up and made a Dragonball movie with his friends. He was a horrible choice for the role. He doesn't even look like Goku.I was hoping that playing Piccalo would be a break-out role for James Marsters (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but that's not the case. He wasn't a bad choice for the role but this movie isn't going make anyone a star. Hell the movie even managed to make Chow Yun Fat look bad as Master Roshi. Yes, he's perfectly goofy as him but while giving a bad performance. His outburst about how he's the great Master Roshi when he's introduced is embarrassing and awkward especially compared to his great work in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The movie is based on the show that was just called Dragonball I should mention. There was no Vegeta, Trunks , Frieza or Cell in that series. Krillin was left out as well even though he was in the Dragonball series.  The show had Goku trained by Master Roshi, looking for dragonballs with Bulma and fighting in tournaments. He also transformed into an ape occasionally. While Piccalo was the main bad guy in Dragonball.So the movie got some things right but it's still a made for dvd quality film. Goku's ape transformation is horribly done, he just looks like a guy in an ape costume. I thought visual effects have gone further than that. In closing, the Dragonball series, deserved a much better production. If Speed Racer was on worse movie lists of last year, then Dragonball: Evolution definitely will be this year.

1201634,ARAWVCUZQ6X4Q,B001HN69AE,King Me,"[4, 15]","I really enjoyed this movie! I'm sorry so many people seemed to hate it. I've seen many (of the seemingly thousands!) of Dragonball episodes and movies over the years, and I really liked the way they created this live version. They made some small changes to the story and some characters that I'm familiar with, but I thought the changes made sense in putting together a 90-minute movie. I especially like the change they made to Chi Chi. She's now extremely cute and not at all the screeching banshee that she mostly is in the cartoon series. I thought the casting was great all around, and even though Chow Yun-fat looks nothing like Master Roshi from the cartoon, it's Chow Yun-fat for cryin' out loud! He gets to play whatever part he wants! Emmy Rossum as Bulma!? Perfect! I've forgotten the name of the actor who plays Piccollo, but again, perfect! Anyway, I'm enjoying writing this goofy review in the same way I enjoyed watching this and pretty much every Dragonball episode I've seen. Its a very simple story, lots of great action and just a fun time all around. I thought the special effects and the look of the film were great and I'm really sorry that they most likely won't be doing a series of Dragonball films. I would have loved to see Vegeta throwing down. That would have been a blast! Or Frieza! Who's up for some world-shattering combat?!!Ahem. Anyway, to get a hold of my inner child for a moment, This is just a really fun film.

1201637,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001HN69AE,Mark Turner,"[1, 6]","Fans of the anime (cartoon) series DRAGONBALL are legion. They collect everything from gaming cards to actual balls created to go with the show. Some go so far as to make costumes like their favorite characters. So, with Hollywood's reputation for taking source material and screwing it up to make it their own it's no surprise that fans weren't not enthused about the making of let alone the release of DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION.For those fans my guess is they didn't like the final product. The film opened to mild interest and even lower box office returns. And having watched only 2 or 3 episodes with my son when he was little, I can see why they weren't leaping over one another to purchase tickets. The story has changed and that is something die hard fans can rarely if ever accept. So what's the movie itself like? Not bad if you toss aside the history of Dragonball and look at it on its own. Not great, but not bad.Goku (Justin Chatwin) is being raised by his grandfather. At home they study an ancient form of martial arts that is beyond most others. All the same, Goku's grandfather has demanded of him that he never display his abilities or get into a fight. The problem is grandpa isn't in high school and picked on by the jerks there.Goku is though and when he comes face to face with them he does all in his power to avoid confrontation. Not easy when he acts clumsily in front of the hot popular girl Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) who also happens to be dating one of the jocks. Fortunate enough for Goku, Jamie takes notice of him anyway.During his training, Goku is told of the Dragonballs, the seven mystical orbs that when united will give the evil Piccolo the ability to take over the world. Entrusted to grandpa and then to Goku is one of the seven orbs. Unfortunately the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) has already collected several of the Dragonballs and on his way for this one.Goku goes to a party hosted by Chi Chi only to be confronted by the bullies. While his anger rages, he does stay true to his promise of not fighting by avoiding any and all attempts to squash him by the bullies. Instead he allows them to use their own force against them. Not only does he beat them up without hitting them, he makes a good impression on Chi Chi as well. But just as things between the two start to gel, Goku realizes that something is happening at home and has to leave.When he gets there, he finds the house in ruins, smashed to pieces and his grandfather lying beneath it all. He helps him out and talks to him, learning of the attack by Piccolo's followers who are trying to gather the Dragonballs. Goku has the one, now he must find those that remain and defend them from Lord Piccolo. And to do so he must enlist the help of Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) to complete his training.Along the way Goku gets the help of several partners all seeking their own fame and fortune including another Dragonball owner and a fortune hunter. As they search they also find Chi Chi at a martial arts competition as well as numerous bad guys in the employ of Lord Piccolo.As one could predict from the beginning of this film, the eventual combination of all seven Dragonballs will happen and Lord Piccolo will get involved in a final showdown with either Goku or Master Roshi. And while Roshi may seem a bumbling inebriated fool, never underestimate your opponent or his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.The film offers some decent martial arts sequences though when placed up against the natural or high wire scenes from far too many Chinese imports they seem rather slow and thought out. As a fan of the genre, that's the first thing you notice. If you've not seen many of these (or any Bruce Lee film) then the film comes off as a fast paced fight film. The average moviegoer will be impressed.The story is based on one of the many chapters of the legendary anime series and moves along at breakneck speed. One minute we're training with grandfather the next we're on the road saving the world. The fact that it's based on this anime series makes that more believable. But the world of Dragonball is not one of reality but one of fantasy and in that realm this movie delivers.As I said at the outset, fans of fictional characters and worlds are hard pressed to find the results delivered from Hollywood to suit their expectations. Even when they deliver the goods aren't always what those fans wanted. For every LORD OF THE RINGS there is a DUNE. Fans have so much invested in these worlds that what they get never meets their expectations.If you go into this movie expecting that world you will be disappointed. If you go in looking for a decent action film that matches many tossed out by Hollywood, you'll walk away entertained. The low box office receipts say that there won't be a sequel. But that won't prevent those who take this movie on its own merits from having an enjoyable night at the movies.",3,ANIME BECOMES REAL LIFE,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,4898,"['Fans', 'anime',

Unfortunately, this movie proved to be the latter.

The story has been adapted to fit our world, so to speak - Goku goes to a high school like a regular kid, and most of the actors in this film are Caucasian. Now, retrofitting a fictional universe to fit more into our reality to make a movie isn't always a bad idea, but it wasn't executed very well here. One thing I did like was when Goku goes to ChiChi's party (in this film, she is a mere mortal girl, no Ox King or anything) and he defeats the bullies without even touching them and causing them to destroy the leader's car. Awesome scene there.However, the ending of the movie just made me go WTF.

Well thankfully, Dragonball: Evolution is not the train wreck of a movie that many thought it would be, but is instead an overly hammy and slightly overcooked take on the Dragonball mythos that's biggest accomplishment is the fact that its cast manages to keep straight faces throughout the proceedings. Justin Chatwin (War of the Worlds, The Invisible) stars as Goku, who seeks revenge on the evil Lord Piccolo (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James Marsters) for the death of his grandfather in his search to collect the mystical Dragonballs and jump-start some universal destruction. Chow Yun-Fat is along for the ride as well as Master Roshi, as is Emmy Rossum as Bulma and Jamie Chung as Chi Chi; but none of which other than Marsters stands out as anything memorable. The rest of the film's aspects, from its special effects to its fight choreography, to the sloppy direction from Final Destination helmer James Wong, to the fact that the film is just over before you know it, all end up sealing Dragonball: Evolution's grave.

The entire story is quite original to those who have no background in Asian comic book stories, and I won't go into the details here, but everything else was horrible.  First of, why is the main character a white man when the setting is in Asia, and the main character's father is Oriental?  Second, why do all these Hollywood produced movies have to have the white man pick up the hot chinese babe in the movie?  Why not the other way around?  And why did Chow-Yun Fat sign up for this movie?  His role was utterly ridiculous.  Worst of all was the kung fu fighting.

1201648,A329U9CDUPKXAC,B001HN69AE,Patrick,"[3, 17]","First let me say, this movie is extremely flawed. But I think that's due entirely due to the low budget of the film. Also, if you're a fan of the Dragonball series, you will know that this movie does not have a whole lot in common with it. However, if you accept the movie as a different take on the Dragonball series and accept it for what it is, the movie is highly entertaining. I really enjoyed all the characters. Most notably Justin Chatwin as Goku. Sure, he was a white guy. But I think he really fit the part. I also loved his relationship with Chi Chi and Master Roshi. The weakest character, sadly, was Piccolo who REALLY needed more screen time. He's sort of an after thought. The movie also could have benefited from more fight scenes. The movie in general was way too short but I think that's due to the budget.After seeing the Legend of Chun Li, I was expecting this movie to be just as bad. But I was pleasantly surprised. I think Dragonball fanboys will despise the film but I don't really care. The movie gets 5 stars from me for being the best it could be given the budget it had.It's REALLY shameful how Fox treated this movie. It got nearly NO advertising. The movie came out last week and I had no idea it was out. I saw ZERO ads for it. Fox should NOT be allowed to handle films like this if they're not going to take it seriously.

1201649,A2FF11D7REYZMX,B001HN69AE,"PlanetHell ""EmbraceThatSmothers""","[2, 12]","Justin Chatwin's bad preformance. His acting was really, really bad in many places, literally where he's saying a line just like this: ""I...will...avenge...him...""However, if that can be ignored, this is a near perfect adaptation of Dragonball. Despite many complaints about the Low (when did 40 mil become low budget?) budget of the movie, I don't really get it as I don't see the special effects to be any better than the really big budget movies (golden compass comes to mind).And when it comes to the change of characters, I think for some reason people are just not getting it. Those who haven't ever watched Dragonball/Z/GT...I would've wanted to see this movie regardless of that. But for the fans who seem to the biggest bashers...I don't really get it. They haven't been really changed, just combined.For an example, Goku is much more like Gohan later in the series. He is a teenager, doesn't really fit in school, but a girl likes him, etc. All of that is taken from that part of the story. ChiChi is like Chichi but in more ways like Gohan's girlfriend Videl, being a high school student, and being rich, etc, but still being pretty much the strongest woman alive. Yamcha hasn't been changed at all, save different hair color and outfit. Bulma has been made a stronger character, even though in the series she can be a very strong character, just a lot less mature. That is the biggest change in the movie there is.Master Roshi, save the white beard, is the same. He is still a pervert at times and then an actual master of martial arts and a trainer at others.Grandpa Gohan is actually given a part. Isn't that a good thing? And yes, I have seen ""Kirate Kid,"" and I do see the simiarilities of his part there. I do not see anything wrong with taking inspiration from that movie. Wouldn't any trainer who trained a teenage boy all seem like Mr. Miyagi (spelling) from Karate Kid?I've even heard some people complain of why Piccolo was the villian. Ha; this is King Piccolo, whom was originally a villian. And Mai was just an added bonus to make the movie more exciting. She's somewhat based on a woman who served a character who was like a smaller, not very strong villian. But that's not a big change, and she's put in leather instead of an army commando outfit. She gets the power to shapeshift. Whatever...With all that said, the reason why they called it ""Dragonball: Evolution"" is because it is an evolution of the series, another form as was the change from Dragonball to Dragonball Z, and even then to GT. This is basically number four, and it's really good.As for the movie itself, there are many things you wouldn't have really expected on screen. ""SPOILER!"" Oozaru is in the movie, also partially based on his GT form as well as his normal form. This is not a massive altering; it's combining elements from different parts.DOing all of this makes the movie very suprising in many places. The acting otherwise is pretty good, like Chun Yo Fat as Master Roshi, and James Marsters as King Piccolo. Emmy Rossum is not the best, but still doesn't a decent job. The other lesser known actors and actresses also did an pretty good job.There is also much dragonball searching, as well as several good battles, including the last one with Goku vs. Piccolo. All of them are good. There are some cool capsule corp vechicles, etc.All in all, this is a very good adaptation. I would give it 10 stars if Justin Chatwin's acting wasn't so bad. He is terrible. If (or do) they make a sequel, he needs to be recast. I think starting there would make more fans happy.So I push it down to 4 stars, though more like 4.5 because it is that well done (I for one am really happy they even made a movie based off the Dragonball Series)that it doesn't make the movie not worth seeing. I reccomend everyone buy this CD, and try to ignore Justin Chatwin's acting and enjoy how good the rest of the movie really is.",4,An evolution and near perfect movie...except...,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,3908,"['Justin', 'Chatwin', 'bad', 'preformance', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'many', 'places', 'literally', 'where', 'saying', 'line', 'just', 'will', 'avenge', 'However', 'can', 'be', 'ignored', 'near', 'perfect', 'adaptation', 'Dragonball', 'many', 'complaints', 'Low', 'when', 'did', '40', 'mil', 'become', 'low', 'budget', 'budget', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'better', 'really', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'golden', 'compass', 'mind', '.And', 'when', 'change', 'characters', 'think', 'reason', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'getting', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'watched', 'Dragonball/Z/GT', 'would', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'regardless', 'fans', 'who', 'seem', 'biggest', 'bashers', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'really', 'changed', 'just', 'combined.For', 'example', 'Goku', 'much', 'more', 'Gohan', 'later', 'series', 'teenager', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'school', 'girl', 'etc', 'taken', 'part', 'story', 'ChiChi', 'Chichi', 'more', 'ways', 'Gohan', 'girlfriend', 'Videl', 'being', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'being', 'rich', 'etc', 'still', 'being', 'pretty', 'much', 'strongest', 'woman', 'alive', 'Yamcha', ""n't"", 'been', 'changed', 'save', 'different', 'hair', 'color', 'outfit', 'Bulma', 'been', 'made', 'stronger', 'character', 'even', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'strong', 'character', 'just', 'lot', 'less', 'mature', 'biggest', 'change', 'movie', 'there', 'is.Master', 'Roshi', 'save', 'white', 'beard', 'same', 'still', 'pervert', 'times', 'then', 'actual', 'master', 'martial', 'arts', 'trainer', 'others.Grandpa', 'Gohan', 'actually', 'given', 'part', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'yes', 'have', 'seen', 'Kirate', 'Kid', 'do', 'see', 'simiarilities', 'part', 'there', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'taking', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'Would', ""n't"", 'trainer', 'who', 'trained', 'teenage', 'boy', 'seem', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'spelling', 'Karate', 'Kid', ""'ve"", 'even', 'heard', 'people', 'complain', 'why', 'Piccolo', 'was', 'villian', 'Ha', 'King', 'Piccolo', 'whom', 'was', 'originally', 'villian', 'Mai', 'was', 'just', 'added', 'bonus', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'exciting', 'somewhat', 'based', 'woman', 'who', 'served', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'smaller', 'not', 'very', 'strong', 'villian', 'not', 'big', 'change', 'put', 'leather', 'instead', 'army', 'commando', 'outfit', 'power', 'shapeshift', 'said', 'reason', 'why', 'called', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'evolution', 'series', 'form', 'was', 'change', 'Dragonball', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'even', 'then', 'GT', 'basically', 'number', 'four', 'really', 'good.As', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'really', 'expected', 'screen', 'SPOILER', 'Oozaru', 'movie', 'also', 'partially', 'based', 'GT', 'form', 'as', 'well', 'normal', 'form', 'not', 'massive', 'altering', 'combining', 'elements', 'different', 'parts.DOing', 'movie', 'very', 'suprising', 'many', 'places', 'acting', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'good', 'Chun', 'Yo', 'Fat', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'James', 'Marsters', 'King', 'Piccolo', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'not', 'best', 'still', ""n't"", 'decent', 'job', 'other', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'actresses', 'also', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job.There', 'also', 'much', 'dragonball', 'searching', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'good', 'battles', 'including', 'last', 'one', 'Goku', 'vs.', 'Piccolo', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'cool', 'capsule', 'corp', 'vechicles', 'etc.All', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'would', 'give', '10', 'stars', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'terrible', 'do', 'make', 'sequel', 'be', 'recast', 'think', 'starting', 'there', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'fans', 'happy.So', 'push', 'down', '4', 'stars', 'though', 'more', '4.5', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'am', 'really', 'happy', 'even', 'made', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'Dragonball', 'Series', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'seeing', 'reccomend', 'everyone', 'buy', 'CD', 'try', 'ignore', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'acting', 'enjoy', 'how', 'good', 'rest', 'movie', 'really']",Dragonball: Evolution

But in this case, I had to revise my opinion of DB, rather drastically.Overall, Dragonball: Evolution is a schizophrenic film. On some levels, it captures the essence of the original Dragonball; on other levels, it's completely wrong.One oddity early in the development of the movie was that the released trailers actually made it look WORSE than it was -- in rather blatant contradiction to the normal approach where you try to make things look better than they are. The trailer led one to believe a number of things that simply weren't true (i.e., things that had, in fact, NOT been changed from the original were made to appear completely different). Why this was, I don't know. It's POSSIBLE the intent was to achieve the effect of making the viewer pleasantly surprised and thus view the movie more positively after the fact, but it seems a very risky method, and one that clearly didn't work well given that Dragonball:Evolution didn't make buttloads of money.Spoilers follow, so don't read farther if you don't want to know!The essence of Dragonball was preserved in some ways. It takes place on a version of Dragonworld -- it may be called Earth (""Chikyuu""), but it's Dragonworld. We have Capsules, and bizarre technology, wierd mixes of cultures... it LOOKS like a Toriyama world, made real, in many ways. On the other hand, much of the early imagery and culture looked too much like our own.As I rather expected, they fused Gohan and Goku in terms of personality. This actually works well in that it allows us to introduce Goku in an at least somewhat familiar setting.(Worries about him being a loser being beaten up... no, he's not. He has been made fun of, but it's not because he CAN'T fight...)Chatwin, I'm happy to say, does this version of Goku well. He gets the innocence and awkwardness of the Gohan aspects, and when the time comes to be more ""Goku"", he shows it perfectly. Okay, his hair isn't nine inches high, but it's spiky in a very Saiyajin way.Rossum *IS* Bulma. Yes, they've given her some action sequences, but I think that improves her character in context.Chow Yun Fat was, as I said earlier, the RIGHT choice for Mutenroshi/Kamesenin. They toned down his Ecchi nature, leaving just enough of the dirty old man to keep him the same somewhat, er, earthy character.James Marsters was, in fact, the PERFECT Piccolo. He sounded like Piccolo, he moved like Piccolo, and yes, he was very much GREEN like Piccolo Daimao. This was quite a surprise, given my early impressions.The casting, thus, was some of the good material in this movie. The plotline IN OUTLINE is pretty much standard Dragonball. The overall script, however, just doesn't quite manage it. There are clever pieces... but they don't quite hang together. The spirit's there, but it's not allowed all the way OUT.Oh, one of the lies told in the previews? The mystics who banded together did NOT create the Dragonballs. They invented the Maa Fubaaa, a technique an awful lot of DB fans forget about, to capture and imprison Piccolo. The Dragonballs are, in fact, what they were always supposed to be, and the Great Dragon Shen-Long DOES make an appearance.The music's pretty good, too.Again, that's some of the good points, but the other pieces didn't quite gel. It seemed almost as though there was an argument or conflict with both the script and acting/directing as to ""how far"" to go, how much of the original to keep, and how to do it. One of the characteristics of Dragonball/DBZ is the *SCALE* of conflict, and they just didn't quite get to the level you need to in the final battle.So in short, it's worth viewing, but it doesn't, alas, manage to give the pure adaptation we could have hoped for.",3,Revise the Spirit.

If you are an avid Dragon Ball fan you will not like this movie at all. period. There are so many derivations and differences between the anime and the movie that you most likely wont be able to stomach more than a half-hour of it. If you have no awareness of the anime the story WILL be confusing and many of the plot elements won't add up at all.So this puts Dragonball Evolution between a rock and a hard place. It can't appeal to its fan base because it doesn't even try to match things up very well, which it technically doesn't ever intend to being a outspoken ""evolution""(derivation) movie, and it can't appeal to newcomers because it simply wont make sense.So does it have any appeal at all? It you are under 12 yes! Seriously this is a movie that a kid can really enjoy. Its PG rating has kept it almost completely free of language, blood, and innuendo and the action is steady throughout. Most kids (especially boys) will get a kick out of the ki-balls being shot around and the crazy choreography. Will it appeal to anyone else?

1201660,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B001HN69AE,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[0, 2]","THE MOVIELike many, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z served to not only entertain me as a child, but also introduce me to the world of anime and martial arts. Goku, Piccolo, Roshi, and the rest of the crew were on the TV in our living room at least two days a week, and my friends and I would engorge ourselves on any and all things DB -- from official toys to unofficial translated ROMs of GameBoy and NES games that had little to do with the actual shows we had watched.So when Dragonball Evolution was announced as a live action movie, and when the casting began to be revealed, to say I was worried would be an understatement. I had seen so many other classic shows and series ruined by modern movie remakes... But DBZ!? ""Wait until it comes out,"" everyone would say. ""Maybe it will be decent!""Well, in a way, they were right.If you watch the film expecting a remake of DBZ, or even a retelling of that story, you're going to be horribly disappointed. For some of you, that's going to result in lengthy posts on IMDB about how this differs from the original cartoon. If you watch this and pretend it's a standalone thing not connected to the shows, though, it's actually pretty campy fun. Fantastic? By no means. Entertaining? Absolutely.Yes, the story is full of plotholes and the acting makes SyFy movies look like big-budget Oscar nominees. But, like GI Joe and many, many other movies before it, Dragonball Evolution is not a movie to watch when you want something to think about; it's the movie you put on in the background while you do things, or watch with a large group of friends.As a film, Dragonball Evolution is awful. The pacing is odd, it's riddled with cliches, and it's pretty obvious that the director didn't quite understand what some of the finished special effects shots were going to look like judging by some of the angles. But as entertaining, Dragonball Evolution isn't bad. Watch it with a big group of friends, make fun of it as you notice the godawful elements, and enjoy the moments of fast-paced action and cheesy special effects.If you're a lover of classic cinema, ignore this movie. But if you're a lover of ""so bad they're awesome"" films like Plan 9, Manos, and The Room, then Dragonball Evolution is definitely one to check out.THE DISC- Audio and Video -Like the movie itself, the visuals in Dragonball Evolution are a very mixed bag. On one hand, the AVC MPEG-4 encode (1080p, 2.40:1 OAR) looks great when it comes details like clothing, sand, pepples, broken glass, and other small, intricate items. Skin colors also look great -- starting out. About halfway through, it seems like the hue of skin will shift slightly from time to time. It's a subtle shift, but if look closely or jump a few chapters ahead after the first two, you'll probably notice it.Blacks are also fairly bright, which gives the entire film a warmer, brighter looking appearance, even in its darkest moments. The green screen special effects shots also vary wildly, with some looking fantastic, and near demo quality -- and others looking like they're from a Shaw Bros. film.Overall, however, the video in Dragonball Evolution is well above average, proving that at least part of the movie was well made.The audio, however, steals the show. (Not hard to do when it's really only competing against the video...). Evolution sports a DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack, and it sounds great from beginning to end.Bass is just booming enough to make you feel it, but not so much that action scenes drown out the speech. (Although, that may have been a good idea...) Music is strong, and the surround sound placement makes perfect sense for the action on-screen.In terms of the A/V, Dragonball Evolution is a great release. It's just too bad that the movie they gave the technical team to work with happened to be this one...- Extras -As expected, the extras here are bare minimum, and not really creative at all. There are the required deleted scenes, blooper reel, and behind-the-scenes look at the making of Evolution. The lengthiest extra is a 25 minute interview with star Justin Chatwin (Goku), talking about his career, playing Goku, and everything you'd expect someone promoting a movie to talk about.There's only one real Blu-ray exclusive, and that's an extra called ""Goku's Quest,"" which you need to unlock by pushing a button on your remote each time a dragonball shows up in the film. It's annoying to watch the movie holding a remote, and the pay-off isn't worth it at all. The Blu-ray also comes with a digital copy of the movie, in case you want to play a prank on your film school friend by loading this onto his Macbook while he's busy sipping tea at a coffee shop.- Verdict -As a remake of Dragon Ball Z, Dragonball Evolution falls flat in every regard. As a ""film,"" Dragonball Evolution falls flat in every regard. But as mindless entertainment, and a movie that any fan of MST3K would enjoy, it's perfect. Watch it with a big group of friends, have some drinks, and make fun of it. And if you do watch it, the Blu-ray version is the one to go with, as the video and audio are far superior to the DVD. Hell, it's so good that it almost makes the movie look better simply by association.Movie Score: 1 / 5Disc Score: 4 / 5Overall Score: 2 / 5",2,A must-watch for fans of MST3K/SyFy Movies ... and for no

If they were reviewing this movie then I think they would give it at least 4 stars and probably 5.I'm not a 15-year-old boy (...well, kinda at heart) but I do enjoy martial arts and fantastical movies and this has both of those elements in it with a lot of special effects and Mr. Hardboiled himself, Chow Yun Fat (that was a big surprise).  For what it seems to be (a live action fantasy based upon the Dragonball Z anime & manga) it was enjoyable but unspectacular.  The leads of Goku and the girl he's crushing on, Chi Chi, are both likable and both bring ample physicality to their roles.  Goku is the would-be savior of the world when some green-skinned conqueror named Piccolo (isn't that a musical instrument?) comes to call.  There are some decent action moments and bright visuals.  The attractive but too-old-for-the-role Emmy Rossum plays a screwball-ish character and feels out of place but other than this the movie comes off as otherwise harmless Saturday morning cartoon fare turned live action.Adults who don't like Saturday morning cartoons would probably not be looking at this in the first place and would be better served watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".

1201666,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001HN69AE,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 11]","It seems Hollywood studios still don't get it. Spending 100 million dollars doesn't exactly mean great entertainment value or commercial success especially when making a film based on pop culture icons. They need a better script, better actions and most of all, someone like Guillermo del Toro, who can direct a film with confidence. ""Dragonball Evolution"" has none of them.Some people in Hollywood just don't understand Son Goku is not Peter Parker, but anyway they wanted our hero act that way. Son Goku (Justin Chatwin) is a high school student whose bicycle is crushed by a bully's car. The fact is, Goku is a martial artist who can use the enormous power of ""Ki,"" but his grandfather (and master) Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) forbids him to use it. However, Goku cannot take it any more, so he confronts the school bullies without actually throwing a punch. The brief scene, which reminded me of the cafeteria scene in ""Spider-man,"" is arguably the best part of the film (with now familiar slow-motions shots). Sadly this is the only part I find interesting in the whole film.The rest of the film is simply a mess with one incoherent story about seven Dragonballs that will grant one wish. Villainous Piccolo (James Marsters) attempts to get them all to destroy the world, as the lengthy narration says, but his motive is not clear and besides, being already a formidable enemy with a huge floating ship, Piccolo really doesn't need them, does he?Goku's romance with Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) just drags. The subplot of Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and Yamcha (Joon Park) is weak and rushed. Special effects are at best passable. The tone of the film constantly shifts as if director James Wong is not really sure what he is doing. The film only continues to use clich&eacute;s again and again, adding nothing new to the thin story.Many ""Gragonball"" fans complain about the changes done to the original manga. The reaction is understandable, but considering the length of the original books and the number of the events they include, changes are inevitable. I know some characters (like Krillin) must go and some characters' traits should be toned down. (Master Roshi played by Chow Yun Fat looks less eccentric than in comic, for example.)But the real point is, those characters in ""Dragonball Evolution"" have nothing that made the counterparts in the original comics or subsequent anime series so popular and endearing among the fans. If you haven't read the original books or seen the anime, you would not see why the ""Dragonball"" series is so popular all over the world after watching the live-action film. Filmmakers should know Yamcha is not just a bandit; Master Roshi is not just a strange old man; Bulma is not just a gorgeous girl. They all could be very cool, funny and attractive in their own way, with the irresistible charm that the filmed version sadly lacks.Stephen Chow, who is known for his ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" is one of the producers of the film. Perhaps I am not the only one who thinks Chow's delightful over-the-top style of direction would have been perfect for the live-action ""Dragonball.""",1,Japanese Pop Culture Turned into Weak B-Action Flick,1239926400,"04 17, 2009",2009,3099,"['Hollywood', 'studios', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Spending', '100', 'million', 'dollars', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'mean', 'great', 'entertainment', 'value', 'commercial', 'success', 'especially', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'based', 'pop', 'culture', 'icons', 'need', 'better', 'script', 'better', 'actions', 'most', 'someone', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'who', 'can', 'direct', 'film', 'confidence', 'Evolution', 'none', 'them.Some', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Son', 'Goku', 'not', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'anyway', 'wanted', 'hero', 'act', 'way', 'Son', 'Goku', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'bicycle', 'crushed', 'bully', 'car', 'fact', 'Goku', 'martial', 'artist', 'who', 'can', 'use', 'enormous', 'power', 'Ki', 'grandfather', 'master', 'Gohan', 'Randall', 'Duk', 'Kim', 'use', 'However', 'Goku', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'more', 'school', 'bullies', 'actually', 'throwing', 'punch', 'brief', 'scene', 'reminded', 'cafeteria', 'scene', 'Spider-man', 'arguably', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'now', 'familiar', 'slow-motions', 'shots', 'Sadly', 'only', 'part', 'find', 'interesting', 'whole', 'film.The', 'rest', 'film', 'simply', 'mess', 'one', 'incoherent', 'story', 'seven', 'Dragonballs', 'will', 'grant', 'one', 'wish', 'Villainous', 'Piccolo', 'James', 'Marsters', 'get', 'destroy', 'world', 'lengthy', 'narration', 'motive', 'not', 'clear', 'besides', 'being', 'already', 'formidable', 'enemy', 'huge', 'floating', 'ship', 'Piccolo', 'really', ""n't"", 'need', 'Goku', 'romance', 'Chi', 'Chi', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'just', 'drags', 'subplot', 'Bulma', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Yamcha', 'Joon', 'Park', 'weak', 'rushed', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'best', 'passable', 'tone', 'film', 'constantly', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'doing', 'film', 'only', 'use', 'clich', 'eacute', 'again', 'again', 'adding', 'nothing', 'new', 'thin', 'story.Many', 'Gragonball', 'fans', 'complain', 'changes', 'done', 'original', 'manga', 'reaction', 'understandable', 'considering', 'length', 'original', 'books', 'number', 'events', 'include', 'changes', 'are', 'inevitable', 'know', 'characters', 'Krillin', 'must', 'go', 'characters', 'traits', 'should', 'be', 'toned', 'down', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'played', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'less', 'eccentric', 'comic', 'example', 'real', 'point', 'characters', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'have', 'nothing', 'made', 'counterparts', 'original', 'comics', 'subsequent', 'anime', 'series', 'popular', 'endearing', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'original', 'books', 'seen', 'anime', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'Dragonball', 'series', 'so', 'popular', 'world', 'watching', 'live-action', 'film', 'Filmmakers', 'should', 'know', 'Yamcha', 'not', 'just', 'bandit', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'not', 'just', 'strange', 'old', 'man', 'Bulma', 'not', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'cool', 'funny', 'attractive', 'own', 'way', 'irresistible', 'charm', 'filmed', 'version', 'sadly', 'lacks.Stephen', 'Chow', 'who', 'known', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'one', 'producers', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Chow', 'delightful', 'over-the-top', 'style', 'direction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'live-action', 'Dragonball']",Dragonball: Evolution
1201667,AYW23ZT2ZCXN4,B001HN69AE,"Vocaloid ""Digi""","[18, 27]","Fans of the original Dragon-Ball franchise who have been drawn to the series distinct humor will find disappointment in Dragonball: Evolution. Goku who has been friendly strong and kind in the show has now become a whinny invert school-boy that gets picked on in classes. Chichi has gone through a total personality change as well, from a bossy loud-mouth to an over-friendly popular rich airhead that falls heads over heels for Goku almost instantly. Goku punches Chichi in the movie by 'accident'. It was surprising how she was so calm and 'forgiving' about being knocked out. The fact is that in the anime Chichi had to run after Goku to grab his attention, not the other way around. Bulma has also gone through a personality change and had it not been for the two blue strands of hair and actually saying her name she would have been unrecognizable with the exception of the machines. Yamcha has completely lost his fear of women and instead is like a lousy fill-in sand dune wannabe cool guy. Piccolo, instead of being the unique bad-guy with split personalities has become just the ""bad-guy"". He has totally lost his antenna's and pointy ears as well being reduce to a incomplete villain that just sends out his chick to do all his dirty work. Where are the rest of the characters? Where's Launch, Krillin, Yamcha's floating cat buddy, Tien and Chichi's oversized strong-as-an-ox father and others? Heck, even the dinosaurs are missing except for the giant eggs-scene at the very beginning of the movie.Another disappointment is the fight-scenes. They are pretty linear in concern of action-fullfilling. A lot more of doing cool, swirly hand-signals and gun pointing/zapping than fights. And what has happened to Gohan's extension pole? It's not even included.Goku turning into a Oozaru was pretty lame too. Instead of being the size of King-Kong he's normal height with no tail. All he has to do is to ""believe in himself"" and he'd return back to normal, which is not how it goes! The most disappointing of them all was the fight with piccolo, the Kamehameha (not 'Kameha' like the movie says) is supposed to be a gigantic ball of energy shot towards the opponent. Instead it has been reduced down to a stream of wisps when Goku lunges at Piccolo. When Master Roshi 'dies' the summoned dragon is a dwarfed,speechless,golden' glow version of the impressive original. No black ominous skies. Just a chopped, quick cameo with some cracking-noises, wind and lighting in broad daylight.Some scenes are just down-right corny they are laughable. Why is piccolo being taken care of by chicks? What happened to the little-girl hiding under the destroyed village? Why is it that both Bulma and Chichi want to make out with the guys just like that? Fans of the original, stay away from this rushed-out preview. The OVA movies are way better in the way that they can be viewed with or without the series.",2,So Purty Lights!,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,2899,"['Fans', 'original', 'Dragon-Ball', 'franchise', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'series', 'distinct', 'humor', 'will', 'find', 'disappointment', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'Goku', 'who', 'been', 'friendly', 'strong', 'kind', 'show', 'now', 'become', 'whinny', 'invert', 'school-boy', 'picked', 'classes', 'Chichi', 'gone', 'total', 'personality', 'change', 'as', 'well', 'bossy', 'loud-mouth', 'over-friendly', 'popular', 'rich', 'airhead', 'heads', 'heels', 'Goku', 'almost', 'instantly', 'Goku', 'Chichi', 'movie', ""'accident"", 'was', 'surprising', 'how', 'was', 'so', 'calm', ""'forgiving"", 'being', 'knocked', 'out', 'fact', 'anime', 'Chichi', 'had', 'run', 'Goku', 'grab', 'attention', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'Bulma', 'also', 'gone', 'personality', 'change', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'two', 'blue', 'strands', 'hair', 'actually', 'saying', 'name', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unrecognizable', 'exception', 'machines', 'Yamcha', 'completely', 'lost', 'fear', 'women', 'instead', 'lousy', 'fill-in', 'sand', 'dune', 'wannabe', 'cool', 'guy', 'Piccolo', 'instead', 'being', 'unique', 'bad-guy', 'split', 'personalities', 'become', 'just', 'bad-guy', 'totally', 'lost', 'antenna', 'pointy', 'ears', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'reduce', 'incomplete', 'villain', 'just', 'out', 'chick', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'Where', 'are', 'rest', 'characters', 'Where', 'Launch', 'Krillin', 'Yamcha', 'floating', 'cat', 'buddy', 'Tien', 'Chichi', 'oversized', 'strong-as-an-ox', 'father', 'others', 'Heck', 'even', 'dinosaurs', 'are', 'missing', 'giant', 'eggs-scene', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie.Another', 'disappointment', 'fight-scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'linear', 'concern', 'action-fullfilling', 'lot', 'more', 'doing', 'cool', 'swirly', 'hand-signals', 'gun', 'pointing/zapping', 'fights', 'happened', 'Gohan', 'extension', 'pole', 'not', 'even', 'included.Goku', 'turning', 'Oozaru', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'too', 'Instead', 'being', 'size', 'King-Kong', 'normal', 'height', 'tail', 'do', 'believe', ""'d"", 'return', 'back', 'normal', 'not', 'how', 'most', 'disappointing', 'was', 'fight', 'piccolo', 'Kamehameha', 'not', ""'Kameha"", 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'gigantic', 'ball', 'energy', 'shot', 'opponent', 'Instead', 'been', 'reduced', 'stream', 'wisps', 'when', 'Goku', 'Piccolo', 'When', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'summoned', 'dragon', 'dwarfed', 'speechless', 'golden', 'glow', 'version', 'impressive', 'original', 'black', 'ominous', 'skies', 'Just', 'chopped', 'quick', 'cameo', 'cracking-noises', 'wind', 'lighting', 'broad', 'daylight.Some', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'down-right', 'corny', 'are', 'laughable', 'Why', 'piccolo', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'chicks', 'What', 'happened', 'little-girl', 'hiding', 'destroyed', 'village', 'Why', 'Bulma', 'Chichi', 'want', 'make', 'out', 'guys', 'just', 'Fans', 'original', 'stay', 'away', 'rushed-out', 'preview', 'OVA', 'movies', 'are', 'way', 'better', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'series']",Dragonball: Evolution
