They are packaged in standard DVD cases just as if you were buying them separately in a store....except you are getting each for about 1/3 to 1/2 the price you would pay for them separately. Actually I think Paul Newman's performance is better in these 3 movies than in some of his pot-boilers like Cat On a Hot Tin Roof or The Long Hot Summer (where his performances seem stiff and over-acted). In the Hustler, Jackie Gleason proves he is as fine a dramatic actor as any of his time and has a true reason for his reported ""swelled head"". Although I still think Hud was Paul Newman's best-ever performance, you can't beat the price of this set if you are a Paul Newman collector.",5,What a treat,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,768,"['WOW', 'just', 'plain', 'WOW', 'get', '3', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'greatest', 'movies', 'low', 'low', 'price', 'are', 'packaged', 'standard', 'DVD', 'cases', 'just', 'were', 'buying', 'separately', 'store', 'are', 'getting', 'about', '1/3', '1/2', 'price', 'would', 'pay', 'separately', 'Actually', 'think', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'performance', 'better', '3', 'movies', 'pot-boilers', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'Long', 'Hot', 'Summer', 'where', 'performances', 'seem', 'stiff', 'over-acted', 'Hustler', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'as', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'time', 'true', 'reason', 'reported', 'swelled', 'head', 'still', 'think', 'Hud', 'was', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'best-ever', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'price', 'set', 'are', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'collector']",N/A

""Butch Cassidy"" is arguably his most famous film, but ""The Verdict"" and ""The Hustler"" showcase some of his best work. I enjoyed watching all three. My only disappointment is that the collection did not include ""Cool Hand Luke,"" which is my favorite Newman film. Newman transcended his leading-man looks -- those blue eyes! -- to become a very fine actor with an appeal that endured well into his later years.
