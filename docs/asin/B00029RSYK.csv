Why she allowed this ""concert"" to be taped (years ago in Atlantic City) is beyond comprehension. The gown is unflattering. The face is puffy. The panty bulge noticeable. Yes, the voice is there, but the show gives no hint of her greatness, her power, her dynamic. There is no banter, no flower-tossing, no ""Natalie."" If this is her life, she better trade it in.

As with opera singers, and she has the power of an operatic voice, it starts to decline and eventually goes.  Unfortunately Shirley's power and pitch is in declining.  If you love her, get the DVD, if not, skip it.  There was a special several years ago from England I think.  I remember her flying on a hydraulic lift and gold confetti falling.  It was fabulous!  Why don't they release this on DVD?  At least the voice was still incredible.  I love Shirley but this DVD certainly is not worth having unless you are a devoted fan.

828890,A20NTWL30HBNYE,B00029RSYK,"Chris B ""Kuklapolitan""","[0, 0]","Listening to Bassey is an explosive experience...watching her in action is a volcanic eruption...seeing her in person and listening and watching is an out of body extravaganza!!!  Bassey is a rare performer indeed and she has you from the moment she opens that gorgeously expressive and voluptuous mouth until you stop humming one of her and your favorite songs...oh, about a week later I should think.  Shirley Bassey is a wondrous being and gifted beyond belief.  When I saw her performance at the Academy Awards in 2013 I thought I must be listening to a recording.  Who, at the age of (C H O K E), besides Tony Bennett, has the pipes of a 25 year old and the breath of Houdini? You can spell it BASSEY...and that's the only name you'll ever need if you want to catapult yourself into a level of stratosphere where you soar with winged crearues and ride on white glistening unicorns at the same time.  A place where everything is aflame with sound and sequins and every song is a glorious chapter in a book that has yet to be named. In Standing Room Only you will find just a tsate of the Dame who has been pleasing us with her vocal aerobics for 6 decades.  She has a microphone but doesn't require one.  She can fill Carnegie Hall with just a whisper of a hum if she had a mind to.  Oh, that acoustical mouth...those teeth which allow notes to caress and reverberate against them and the controlled tongue which pushes out each defined note as slowly or quickly as she sees fit lest they be rendered ordinary!  She engulfs you with her total being and with each well portioned part.  You cannot help it for you are in the grasp of one of the world's most articulate artists and you cannot help but be wrung out in the process. What she has should be illegal but thank God it isn't!  And thank God, too, that I have been a part of her entire performing life for I have watched her grow and reach and flower and multiply and peak and peak and peak.  Whenever you can, watch anything you can get your hands on for the video performances are few.  I was lucky...I SAW her in person and know the woman and the phenomenon that is Shirley Bassey. SRO is a must have...in fact, buy two!

Stand on her head?I agree that this performance as shown on this DVD does not show her at her greatest, but I honestly believe that the fault lies with the production, where is the fabulous entrance that I have witnessed in the eight of her live performances that I have attended?Her entrances alone are experiences worth the price of the admission.The audience goes wild,just being part of that adoring and screaming audience is part of that overall experience!Also I suspect that the editing was quite poor.And perhaps the venue has something to do with the results, although as I said I have attended eight of her concerts, they all had been in theaters,the first being at Carnegie Hall and the last at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale, never in a night club setting.Anyway, I love Shirley and even if now at 72, she were to give a concertjust mouthing the words to her greatest songs, I will be the first on that line.BRAVO, DAME SHIRLEY!!",5,What is a Dame to do?,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,1053,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'reviewers', 'expected', 'DAME', 'SHIRLEY', 'do', 'Somersaults', 'Stand', 'head', 'agree', 'performance', 'shown', 'DVD', 'not', 'show', 'greatest', 'honestly', 'believe', 'fault', 'production', 'where', 'fabulous', 'entrance', 'have', 'witnessed', 'eight', 'live', 'performances', 'have', 'attended', 'entrances', 'alone', 'are', 'experiences', 'price', 'admission.The', 'audience', 'wild', 'just', 'being', 'part', 'adoring', 'screaming', 'audience', 'part', 'overall', 'experience', 'Also', 'suspect', 'editing', 'was', 'quite', 'poor.And', 'perhaps', 'venue', 'something', 'do', 'results', 'said', 'have', 'attended', 'eight', 'concerts', 'had', 'been', 'theaters', 'first', 'being', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'last', 'Broward', 'Center', 'Performing', 'Arts', 'Fort', 'Lauderdale', 'never', 'night', 'club', 'setting.Anyway', 'love', 'Shirley', 'even', 'now', '72', 'were', 'give', 'concertjust', 'mouthing', 'words', 'greatest', 'songs', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'line.BRAVO', 'DAME', 'SHIRLEY']",N/A
