1389034,ADJ9W8DJJKDJO,B00486DOGY,Erika Young,"[2, 2]","This is a good show, the stories are well written and interesting, but it's hard not to compare it to ""Prime suspect"" which is superior in every aspect.The main flaw of the show is the main character, Commander Claire Blake, who doesn't make sense. She has no self-control when it comes to men, and the risks she takes jeopardize her position in the Police force, can get her in trouble with co-workers and bring her public humiliation. This doesn't make sense for a woman in such high rank, and you keep wondering how she even managed to get to this point in her career.Besides, she doesn't seem tough enough to handle this highly stressful and demanding position. She breaks down often, has panic attacks, takes drugs to combat all that, needs a psychiatrist etc. It seems like she barely manages her job, and not at all in command, like the name of the show suggests.",3,The commandor is not in command,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,870,"['good', 'show', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'interesting', 'hard', 'not', 'compare', 'Prime', 'suspect', 'superior', 'aspect.The', 'main', 'flaw', 'show', 'main', 'character', 'Commander', 'Claire', 'Blake', 'who', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'self-control', 'when', 'men', 'risks', 'jeopardize', 'position', 'Police', 'force', 'can', 'get', 'trouble', 'co-workers', 'bring', 'public', 'humiliation', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'woman', 'such', 'high', 'rank', 'keep', 'wondering', 'how', 'even', 'managed', 'get', 'point', 'career.Besides', ""n't"", 'seem', 'tough', 'enough', 'handle', 'highly', 'stressful', 'demanding', 'position', 'down', 'often', 'panic', 'attacks', 'drugs', 'combat', 'psychiatrist', 'etc', 'barely', 'job', 'not', 'command', 'name', 'show']",N/A
