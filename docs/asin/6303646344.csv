383333,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6303646344,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","A young martial artist fuses with a space-age armor that has been stolen from a secret research facility, the Chronos Corporation, which will stop at nothing to get it back. ""The Guyver"" must now face off against the Zoanoids, half-human creatures controlled by Chronos, in order to stop the company from recovering the Guyver unit and destroying mankind! Straight from the pages of the popular manga by Yoshiki Takaya comes THE GUYVER, a live-action comic book that offers incredible special effects and make-up work by long-time Brian Yuzna collaborator Screaming Mad George. From the living body armor worn by The Guyver to his reptilian adversaries, THE GUYVER produces some of George's most unique and ambitious costume designs. Unfortunately, this is the only area where the film succeeds. Between the poor scripting and laughable performances, THE GUYVER crosses over from campy B-movie fun into straight cheese. Its attempts at incorporating humor into the dialog fail on every level. Not even the brief cameos by Sci-Fi icons Jeffrey Combs and Mark Hamill are able to save the picture. David Gale is the one person to put in an enjoyable performance as the evil Zoalord, recreating the same over-the-top character he played in RE-ANIMATOR and SYNGENOR. While it comes off as being nothing more than an extended television episode of bad rubber monster mayhem, the special effects in the film are enough to warrant at least a single viewing.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,The Guyver,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,1480,"['young', 'martial', 'artist', 'fuses', 'space-age', 'armor', 'been', 'stolen', 'secret', 'research', 'facility', 'Chronos', 'Corporation', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'back', 'Guyver', 'must', 'now', 'face', 'off', 'Zoanoids', 'half-human', 'creatures', 'controlled', 'Chronos', 'order', 'stop', 'company', 'recovering', 'Guyver', 'unit', 'destroying', 'mankind', 'Straight', 'pages', 'popular', 'manga', 'Yoshiki', 'Takaya', 'THE', 'GUYVER', 'live-action', 'comic', 'book', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'work', 'long-time', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'collaborator', 'Screaming', 'Mad', 'George', 'living', 'body', 'armor', 'worn', 'Guyver', 'reptilian', 'adversaries', 'THE', 'GUYVER', 'George', 'most', 'unique', 'ambitious', 'costume', 'designs', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'area', 'where', 'film', 'poor', 'scripting', 'laughable', 'performances', 'THE', 'GUYVER', 'campy', 'B-movie', 'fun', 'straight', 'cheese', 'attempts', 'incorporating', 'humor', 'dialog', 'fail', 'level', 'Not', 'even', 'brief', 'cameos', 'Sci-Fi', 'icons', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'are', 'able', 'save', 'picture', 'David', 'Gale', 'one', 'person', 'put', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'evil', 'Zoalord', 'recreating', 'same', 'over-the-top', 'character', 'played', 'RE-ANIMATOR', 'SYNGENOR', 'off', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'extended', 'television', 'episode', 'bad', 'rubber', 'monster', 'mayhem', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'enough', 'warrant', 'least', 'single', 'viewing.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Guyver VHS

383335,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6303646344,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[3, 7]","I saw The Guyver (1991) a bunch of years ago on the recommendation of a friend and I recall not really being all that impressed at the time, but, since the years have passed, I thought maybe I'd give it another try.  The passage of time did little to change my initial impression of the film, but I do believe I can now appreciate certain elements in the movie more, if not the production as a whole.I guess the main reason I opted to give this film another chance was the fact it was produced by Brian Yuzna, of whom I've always been a fan, based on his involvement in such films as Re-Animator (1985), From Beyond (1986), and Return of the Living Dead III (1993).  While he may never garner acclaim from the mainstream, he seems to thrive in his position on the fringe, enjoying the freedom to develop projects on his own terms.  The film boasts two directors, both primarily known for their special effects works and proving you should stick with what you know, in Screaming Mad George and Steve Wang.  The film stars Jack Armstrong, probably better know to soap opera fans rather than moviegoers, Jimmy (Dy-no-mite!) Walker, the ever charming and instantly recognizable Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes, also the bald-headed mutant biker in the John Hughs film Weird Science), Vivian Wu (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III), David Gale (Re-Animator), and finally one Mr. Mark Hamill, who, after seeing him in this, you really can't help ask yourself, ""What the hell happened to you?"".Okay, so what's the movie about?  Well, let me see if I can lay it out.  There's this alien race, and it seems, a long time ago, they somehow planted the seeds of humanity on Earth, for the purpose of creating an evolved species of life to used as fighters, or some such thing.  It also seems there are those who walk among us that look like normal humans like you and me (well, me at least, as I have no idea what you look like), but can change into hideous monsters imbued with super strength.  These human/monsters, called Zoanoids, have gotten together and formed a corporation, headed by the most powerful of the bunch, the Zoanlord (Gale).  Finally, this corporation has somehow come into possession of a bio-mechanism called the Guyver, which was also left by the aliens (I am unsure if they, like the creatures on Earth, are Zoanoids, or what...I'm sure the comic book details this better).  This Guyver, a proto-type (one of a kind) seems to possess great power, but no one seems to know how to activate it.  Also, we learn that if a Zoanlord gets a hold of the Guyver and figures out how to use it, the consequences could be extremely dire...to us normal humans, I guess...(again, something not made entirely clear in the film).  Anyway, a scientist working on the Guyver, fearing for the sake of humanity I suppose, steals the device, and it ends up in the hands of Sean (Armstrong), as he accidentally activates it, but not before Zoanoid henchmen, lead by Lisker (Berryman) and including Striker (Walker), kill the scientist.  Sean transforms into the Guyver, a character looking much like Spectraman, a Japanese show I used to watch as a kid.  Sean is involved with Mizky (Wu), whose father was the scientist who got killed, and now the Zoanoids are using her to get the Guyver back.  Hamill plays a CIA agent Max Reed, contacted by Mizky's father before his death, and is trying to uncover the secrets behind the corporation.Okay, let me start with what I liked about the film.  I thought the special effects, done by the same guys who directed the film, were really good, especially the monster costumes as they were extremely detailed and highly life-like.  That's about it for what I liked...what I didn't like?  That list is a bit longer...The acting was pretty bad, except for Gale, who sort of revives his Re-Animator character of the evil, lecherous Dr. Hill.  The poor acting is only magnified by the truly awful script.  The characters were pretty lifeless, especially that of Hamill's.  Given they got someone with his name recognition, it became painfully obvious he was only there so they could use his name (just look how prominently it's displayed on the DVD case).  And who let Jimmy (Dy-no-mite!) Walker in the picture?  He was the worst, especially when his character tried to rap, which he did often.  (Did you ever notice that if you add the letter `C' to rap, you get a new word?)  The fight sequences, of which there were many, were fair at best, and the choreography was painfully obvious.  I suspect it's hard to create realism with the stunt people having to perform encased completely within their respective costumes.  These scenes reminded me much of an episode of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, only with a larger budget and better special effects.  Re-Animator fans will enjoy an all to brief appearance of actor Jeffery Combs, who play Dr. West in the Re-Animator film, as a scientist, aptly named Dr. East, working for the corporation.  I was glad to see the film didn't take itself too seriously, as there were a number of humorous points interjected throughout, especially the brief homage to the film Jaws (you'll know it when you see it).The wide screen picture here looks pretty good, but I did notice a few minor flaws.  The sound quality is better, offering three audio options, including Dolby Digital 2.0, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1.  Special features are few, including trailers for Critters (1986), The Highwaymen (2000), The Butterfly Effect (2004), and The Mangler (1995), but not one for the film itself.  There is a sequel, called The Guyver: Dark Hero, but I haven't seen it.  I guess if I learned anything from this film, it's that Jimmy (Dy-no-mite!) Walker shouldn't rap (or act).Cookieman108",2,Part human. Part alien. Pure superpower.

As a comedy, it tried too hard to be goofy and fun; in the end, it was just ridiculous.  Every aspect of this movie was uniformly terrible.  The acting was especially atrocious.  Did they make a casting call at the school of bad acting?  I know the dialog was awful, but did they all have to deliver it with such a self-important air, overemphasizing every line, every look exaggerated.  At least they were consistent, but it was bizarre to watch.  I couldn't help but wonder if they made it this way on purpose, or was it just a sad mistake they all agreed to overlook.  Whatever their intent, this movie didn't succeed on any level.  The trash-talk was lame; the fights were routine, repetitious, and seemingly endless in duration.  The overly fabricated monsters were an incredible waste of rubber.  Mark Hamill was sorely wasted in the thankless role of a CIA agent and the only semi-sane character in the bunch.

It's sci-fi adventure at its best, with epic battles between the forces of good and evil. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it.

383351,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6303646344,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[2, 3]","The Gyver was originally a successful Japanese cartoon series that more than a few anime fans in the U.S. got a taste of back in the 80's. It was visually stunning and was one of those shows that helped jump start the freaky looking anime that's became more prevalent as time went by. Apparently someone got the bright idea of making a live action version back in the 90's. Only there were two problems: One the special effects of the time (as well as the apparent budget of the film) wouldn't have measured up to the original content. Second the script was God-awful and completely screwed up everything cool about the original. In the end not even semi-big name talent like Mark Hamill could save this train wreck of a film.The Gyver, like the original, relies heavily on the visual impact you're supposed to get when seeing hideous and out-of-this-world monsters with powers and strength many times greater than our own. In the cartoon it happened. In the movie not only did it not accomplish this but also apparently it never would have. Instead of nightmare creatures you have guys in foam rubber suits with little or no articulation whatsoever. Movies made in the early 80's had people in monster suits that looked better and responded more realistically than these sad excuses. About the only one that actually looked pretty cool was the Gyver itself, but that was because it's more a suit of armor than a monster (no mouth or facial features to articulate). Not only were the monsters fake looking but just about every other special effect from the gory to the sci-fi types looked fake. Stan Winston must be shaking his head in disbelief on how bad they did this.The story is about as fake as the monsters and special effects. While the premise itself isn't all that bad the execution stinks to high heaven. The way the script is written with a kid's show mentality with lots of comedy relief and stupid dialog between creatures. The villains are as cartoonish as the script. I mean how seriously is a movie supposed to be taken when you have a monster voiced by Good Times' own Jimmy Walker (Dynomite!!!)? For those of you who never seen the cartoon it's essentially about the Gyver fighting monsters hand to hand. They do that here, but the fight scenes are immensely weak. You would think they could at least get that part right (don't bother telling me to blame the suits... they did it with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles years before). The acting is actually serviceable from many of the actors. Mark Hamill does help put at least a little respectability to the movie, but not nearly enough. The music is as cheesy as the costumes and script, so I guess it actually fits with this film.They should have just made this some sort of kids movie instead of trying to make it for mature audiences like they did, because there is no way a self-respecting adult can find any merit to watch this. If they toned down the violence and adult content it could have actually been a decent kiddy flick. As it stands The Gyver is a joke in the poorest order. If you are a fan of the cartoon series I recommend you stay away at all costs as this movie is a travesty to the show where it came from. As a matter of fact the rest of you avoid this too. The only people I can recommend this to are those of you who actually likes watching cheesy movies to make fun of the cheesiness. Because that's just about all you get in this dismally bad idea.",2,Too goofy to be taken seriously.

Just thought I'd let you know.  I don't know squat about the Japanese cartoon, so I'm not here to point out how accurate or inaccurate this movie is.  As for the movie itself, I personally find this a guilty pleasure.  It was produced by Brian Yuzna, and you can definitely tell.  In fact, you could almost swear he directed the film.  Now basically we got a guy who stumbles across this one-of-a-kind body armor unit and it makes him a kind of superhero(it's supposed to be the most destructive and dangerous weapon on the planet yet it only really seems to make you a kung fu expert with a snazzy look.  Plus, it's got an awfully lame and exposed weakness).  An evil corporation wants to get their mitts on this body armor, and they're not about to let some snotnose punk just waltz away with it.  Certain employees of this corporation are humans with the ability to transform into monsters that look like Gremlins, werewolves, Gamera-ish things, etc.  The head honcho of this corporation is none other than everybody's favorite cinematic severed head, David Gale.  He's still playing the evil scientist....and still unable to keep his hands off the female lead.  The leader of the bumbling pack of monsters is Michael Berryman!  Jeffrey Combs shows up in a small role as well.  The coverbox has you under the impression that Mark Hammill is the Guyver, but this isn't true.  He's wasted in a CIA agent role while some goof named Jeff Armstrong plays our hero.  I do enjoy this movie for it's cheesy thrills, but some of the fight scenes, one in particular, goes on way too long.  The makeup jobs are decent enough considering the budget, but there is such a thing as overdosing on big rubber monsters in halfassed kung fu battles(for most of us anyway).  It's too much like a kaiju movie or Power Rangers episode.  In fact, you almost think it's a kids movie, but then it becomes too violent for that.

Even the slangs and bad languages  used were pronounced ever so clearly, word for word...And why is Mark  Hamil shown on the cover of the video with the Guyver costume, anyway?  He's not the Guyver in the movie if I remember correctly...Having said  all this, DON'T miss out &quot;Guyver 2: The Dark Hero&quot;.
