661507,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B00005KAQJ,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","Right away, you can tell that this movie is tying itself directly into the show that it's based on, so a little prior knowledge about the characters couldn't hurt.  Nevertheless, this was still a good film, offering a plot worthy of the cinema while staying consistent with what the show always presented.  I only ever caught a couple of episodes when I was channel-surfing, but as far as I can tell, ""consistent"" is an appropriate term here.  As the kids of Third Street Elementary School depart for summer break, Theodore Jasper ""T.J."" Detweiller learns that, among all of his friends, he will be home alone for the summer as the rest of the gang are off to various summer camps, which, as the movie later shows us, all seem to be in the same state or something.  Bored, T.J. happens to discover some unusual activity occurring at the supposedly-closed school building.  Convincing his principal, Peter Prickly to help him investigate, he instead witnesses the sudden disappearance of the man right in front of his eyes.  He, with the reluctant aide of his older sister, then rounds up his friends and ultimately proves to them that something is not right and they all decide to get to the bottom of it.  While this film is by no means deep, it has a good plot, enjoyable characters both old and new, and a well-structured outline of its story.  It's definitely worth watching for kids, especially fans of the show.  The villains may be a bit corny and over-the-top, but it's never overdone...again, the whole film remains consistent with the nature of the show as far as I can tell.  It's just a nice, fun flick.

I did have some issues with the film though.  I thought the whole thing was...weird.  Of course, the premise was all unrealistic, but it's children's television, what can you expect?  I found it really bizarre though, that the kids recognized and took in stride the reminiscence. I know that when I was a kid, childhood went on forever, and had no end in sight.  That's not the kind of thing you realize while you're growing up, ""hey, I've only got a few more years left"", not at all, and this irritated me a lot, making me think the show-runners were going through a ""aww, childhood!"" patch in their own lives. Another irritation was the music--eugh.  Keep it out of Recess, please, the outside music.

In my opinion, although I prefer the ten-minute episodes, this movie isn't as bad as that. It's funny, creative, and entertaining. My main problem is that it is much less realistic than the TV show, with a simplistic villain, and a plot I'd expect from a ""Spy Kids"" movie.I won't go into the plot. The main idea is that a jealous ex-principal wants to bring up test scores by making it impossible for kids to have fun outside, so they spend all their time inside studying - and they try to take summer vacation away to do so.The characters are still the same people, with the main gang still having their tendency to get into trouble (specifically TJ), and while many of the antagonists from the show work with the other characters, they still have the same personality traits and quirks (ie: The Ashleys).My main complaint with the movie is no fault of the movie itself, but rather my own opinion. I liked the TV shows because it gave endless possibilities to see the characters of the kids. The movie had to focus on action, and as such, it didn't spend much time on character, as the main audience would value action. My favourite character has always been Spinelli, and I just missed her for some reason, even though she was there as much as anyone else. Maybe I'm just blinded as a TJXSpinelli shipper.OK.
