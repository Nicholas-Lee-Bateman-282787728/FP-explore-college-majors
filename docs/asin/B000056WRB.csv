Too much airtime was given to the younger actors which is always a mistake when seasoned talent is also used. Afterall, it's Mr. Pullman's name and talent that makes viewers want to see the movie. It's murder with a twist and a moral: Don't get caught up with Generation X.",4,Pullman pulls average movie into entertainment,1005782400,"11 15, 2001",2001,431,"['Actor', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'average', 'acting', 'younger', 'stars', 'Guilty', 'make', 'pretty', 'good', 'suspense/murder', 'mystery', 'Too', 'much', 'airtime', 'was', 'given', 'younger', 'actors', 'always', 'mistake', 'when', 'seasoned', 'talent', 'also', 'used', 'Afterall', 'Mr.', 'Pullman', 'name', 'talent', 'viewers', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'murder', 'twist', 'moral', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'Generation', 'X']",N/A
571516,A2J0MP2GPNHJHF,B000056WRB,"Claudio Di Gregorio ""ClauDG""","[0, 1]","Entertaining, but unbelievable.**SPOILERS, SPOILERS AND ONLY SPOILERS**Outside of a soap opera, what are the odds of someone unknowingly hiring his own son (whose existence he didn't know) to kill a girl with whom, coincidentally and also unknowingly, the son is temporarily living? What are the odds that son will have a criminal record, and also will have a friend who is being persecuted by thugs and who would be ready to do the job the son refuses to do? There are more implausible coincidences in this hyperconvoluted and hyperfarfetched plot, but these should prove the point.Characters are not only extremely improbable, but they also do not behave in a rational, intelligent way. A senior lawyer is manipulated like a boob to fire a girl on the flimsiest of reasons (with no cause, in fact). As his only leverage, the son has an envelope with evidence to incriminate the father, but instead of hiding it he goes to sleep, so the father easily grabs the envelope. Mysteriously, this same father -to demonstrate that he is an idiot as well- does not destroy the incriminating envelope immediately (souvenir complex?). Later, being interrupted by his wife when he is going to burn it, he exits the house just leaving the envelope on a table (!). Not only that, but days pass without him even remembering about the envelope. So too late he learns that, in the middle of a marital crisis, the wife (apparently also unknowingly) had sent the envelope to the District Attorney.The son goes to the girl's house to prevent her from being murdered, but he botches his speech to such a degree that she expels him from the apartment and he is unable to stop the killer. Generally speaking, characters seem unable to convey information in a clear way, even on essential matters; misinterpretations abound. Too much suspense is built around these confusions and these unnatural behaviors.",2,"So many coincidences, so absurd behaviors",1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,1883,"['Entertaining', 'unbelievable', '**SPOILERS', 'SPOILERS', 'AND', 'ONLY', 'SPOILERS**Outside', 'soap', 'opera', 'what', 'are', 'odds', 'someone', 'unknowingly', 'hiring', 'own', 'son', 'existence', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'kill', 'girl', 'whom', 'coincidentally', 'also', 'unknowingly', 'son', 'temporarily', 'living', 'What', 'are', 'odds', 'son', 'will', 'have', 'criminal', 'record', 'also', 'will', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'being', 'persecuted', 'thugs', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'ready', 'do', 'job', 'son', 'do', 'are', 'more', 'implausible', 'coincidences', 'hyperconvoluted', 'hyperfarfetched', 'plot', 'should', 'prove', 'point.Characters', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'extremely', 'improbable', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'behave', 'rational', 'intelligent', 'way', 'A', 'senior', 'lawyer', 'manipulated', 'boob', 'fire', 'girl', 'flimsiest', 'reasons', 'cause', 'fact', 'only', 'leverage', 'son', 'envelope', 'evidence', 'incriminate', 'father', 'instead', 'hiding', 'sleep', 'father', 'easily', 'envelope', 'Mysteriously', 'same', 'father', '-to', 'demonstrate', 'idiot', 'well-', 'not', 'destroy', 'incriminating', 'envelope', 'immediately', 'souvenir', 'complex', 'Later', 'being', 'interrupted', 'wife', 'when', 'going', 'burn', 'house', 'just', 'leaving', 'envelope', 'table', 'Not', 'only', 'days', 'pass', 'even', 'remembering', 'envelope', 'So', 'too', 'late', 'middle', 'marital', 'crisis', 'wife', 'apparently', 'also', 'unknowingly', 'had', 'sent', 'envelope', 'District', 'Attorney.The', 'son', 'girl', 'house', 'prevent', 'being', 'murdered', 'speech', 'degree', 'expels', 'apartment', 'unable', 'stop', 'killer', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'characters', 'seem', 'unable', 'convey', 'information', 'clear', 'way', 'even', 'essential', 'matters', 'misinterpretations', 'abound', 'Too', 'much', 'suspense', 'built', 'confusions', 'unnatural', 'behaviors']",N/A
