I came across this movie right at the beginning while channel surfing past UPN.  It was brilliant trainwreck from the beginning!  I don't mean to say that it holds a candle to greats like Showgirls or Battlefield Earth, but it was a rollercoaster ride of bad acting, bad effects, bad characters, and almost too many plot lines to count.I could see the movie being called ""Amityville: Dollhouse"" if it were just about the dollhouse.  Instead, this movie is about the dollhouse, the really really creepy stepmother/stepson relationship, the chimney, the bees (and bee demons), the zombie dad, the sibling and step-sibling rivalry, the teenagers-should-not-be-getting-it-on-in-the-shed-with-bees-around concept, and it seems like there were at least 4 other plots going on in the meantime.The bee demons were awesome, with their mean looking battle axes and stuff.  The faux-Wiccan hippie aunt and biker uncle were comic genius.

40458,AE42JLYPXUI45,0782006930,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[2, 3]","In 1997 (but filmed in 1996), the eighth and final Amityville installment had arrived. This eighth installment is appropriately titled, AMITYVILLE DOLLHOUSE: EVIL NEVER DIES.BILL MARTIN (played by Robin Thomas) as built a new house for his family. The house was built on a land where a previous house had originally burned to the ground (this being the Amityville House that burned down in AMITYVILLE 3-D, where continuity was skipped over Amityville 4, 5, 6, & 7, but putting the coninuity into play for this film). Among Bill's family are his beautiful wife, CLAIRE (played by Starr Andreeff), TODD (played by Allen Cutler), JESSICA (played by Rachel Duncan), and JIMMY (played by Jarrett Lennon). Jimmy is Claire's son from her first marriage, while Todd and Jessica are Bill's son and daughter from his first marriage. Bill and his wife are divorced, while Claire's first husband died. They move into the new house, but it seems as though that Jimmy is really not adjusting to the new family. Todd's girlfriend, Dana (played by Lisa Robin Kelly) arrives, where she and Todd go out for awhile.That night, Bill and Claire are awakened by heat. The central AC is turned off and is not coming back on, while the fireplace was mysteriously turned on (automatic fireplace, mind you all). The AC is turned back on, where Bill and Claire go back to bed. But in the garage, the Martin's car runs over a bike that Bill and Claire had bought for Jessica as a surprise for her upcoming birthday. This was done by a dollhouse that Bill found in the shed. The dollhouse is in the shape of the...Amityville House, the house that once stood where the Martin's house is now standing.Jessica's birthday has arrived, and Bill and Claire find that they are without a present for Jessica, but Claire and Bill decide that the dollhouse will be better. Little did they know of the house was soon to bring to the family. At that moment, Jimmy is alienating himself from the party. Todd tries to get him to join, trying to be the bigger person in this situation, since he and Jimmy don't get along, but Jimmy is too stubborn. Todd gives up and heads inside to fill up the pinata. That's when Bill's sister, MARLA (played by Lenore Kasdorf), and her husband TOBIAS (played by Franc Ross) arrive. Todd finishes the pinata, but puts in a fake spider, since Jimmy suffers from Aracnephobia. Jimmy decides to give the pinata a couple of swings. He nails the pinata, with the spider falling on top of him, but the spider that fell on Jimmy was not the rubber spider that Todd put in...this spider was a live tarantula.That night, Jimmy's pet mouse, Max, enters Jessica's room. She watches Max enter her dollhouse, and watches him enjoy running around in it until Max enters a specific bedroom in the dollhouse. The bedroom represents Jess' bedroom, where a huge rat is under her bed...literally. Todd comes in and looks under the bed, and finds two red eyes staring at him. He jumps back and accidentally knocks down the dollhouse, where Max is killed. Jimmy is devestated, blaming Todd for killing him. Todd may have pulled a stupid stunt at the party, but he would never kill Jimmy's mouse, which is why Bill let's him off the hook for Max. As Bill leaves Jimmy's room, Jimmy's father appears and talks of getting rid of Bill. Jimmy agrees to it, not knowing that his father means...murder Bill.The next night, while Bill and Claire are having sex, Claire glances over at Todd's picture. The picture shows Todd in a swimsuit, where Claire begins fantasizing over Todd, her own stepson. That night, Dana shows up, where she and Todd head into the garage to have their own fun. They find a dead wasp locked in a case and toss it aside. It's dead, don't worry about it. They begin having sex, where the wasp bursts through the case, and climbs into Todd's ear. Claire and Bill enter the garage, where they pour liquor into Todd's ear. The wasp climbs out of his ear and dies. All of this chaos is causing Bill to have nightmares again.Some nights later, Bill and Claire go out to dinner, where Dana comes over to spend more time with Todd. As Todd is making drinks for he and Dana, Dana is set on fire by the fireplace. Jimmy and Jessica come downstairs as Todd, puts out the fire. Bill goes with Dana to the hospital as he finds out that Dana is now in a coma. The next afternoon, Marla and Jessica are investigating the Dollhouse, where Marla tells Jessica to write down everything the dollhouse does. Marla and Tobius deal with the supernatural through psychic abilities.That night, Jimmy's father appears again, where he makes it clear of his plan to kill Bill. Jimmy wants no parts of it. He hits Jimmy in the face, where Claire thinks that is Bill, who had done so. She throws him out of the house, but Jimmy tries his best to tell her that is was his own father, not Bill. Seems as though that Jimmy has now warmed up to Bill, Todd, and Jessica. As Claire locks the door, she runs into her...deceased husband. Tobias helps Bill inside, where they destory Claire's dead husband. Claire runs upstairs to get Todd, who is being strangled by an apparition of Dana, but Claire cracks her in the face, and saves Todd. Claire, Todd, and Jimmy head out to the car, as Tobias and Bill save Jessica. She was taken into the dollhouse, where Tobias and Bill enter through the fireplace. Tobias stays behind as Jessica and Bill save themselves (since Tobias told them to do so). The house burns down, as the family gets away safely.This was a much better sequel than that of AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION. Sorry to say that this is the last of the Amityville installments. But you can always watch the 1979 original down to this here eighth installment. Or you can watch THE AMITYVILLE HORROR-2005 Remake.",5,Amityville Dollhouse: Evil Never Dies (1997),1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,5770,"['1997', 'filmed', '1996', 'eighth', 'final', 'Amityville',

She is a VERY attractive lady, dark haired, and I likedher very much. If you are reading this, contact me, I'd like to show you my etchings. ;)Seriously though, her acting was the only acting in the whole movie that did not give me that ""made for TV"" feel, like you get when you  are watching a Stephen King directed movie, such as The Shining bastardization, TommyKnockers, The Stand, Golden Years, etc. They ALL SUCK! Stick to writing please!!!Ok, so I hope you get the picture, that sums up the acting to a T.Another dumb thing about the film is about every villian in the movie hisses, and it seems that EVERYONE is deaf! Someone can be screaming right behind them, and they won't hear a thing. The young boy instantly takes to his creepy looking zombie father when he shows up on the scene. Seriously, the kid took forever before he caught on to the fact that maybe something was up.Watch it if you have to watch the entire series.

A blended family has built a new house on the ground where the original house once stood (though since the first film took place in NY next to a river and this new house is clearly in a CA desert, this is an obvious lie). The parents, busy trying to mend the emmotional dilemas of uniting their step-children, forget about a daughters birthday. Discovering a dollhouse emmulating the original Amityville abode, they give it to her as her gift. The dollhouse, and the fireplace left over from the original home, bring about a resurgence of demons. Before you know it, Step-mom is trying to seduce step-son, dad is becoming violent, girlfriends heads are being blown off by the evil fireplace and anything which is placed inside the dollhouse comes to &quot;terrifying&quot; life in the regular house, including a rodent with giant glowing red eyes, a nifty nod to the original's &quot;Pig eyes&quot; in the window.Though not overly frightening or suspenseful, there certainly are worse things you could see.

Let me start by saying that when I was nine years old I saw my sisters 'The Waltons Playhouse Set' sitting on the table and screamed in sheer terror! The family, that truck!Ok, fast forward to 'Amityville Dollhouse.' I thought that sheer terror would never return. It did. It's so interesting to see how each of the 'Amityville Horror' sequels manages to distance itself from the original.What we have here is a film so ridiculous it can also be entertaining.(Thus the 2 stars.) This involves a family that has a house built nowhere near Amityville (great place for a sequel) and in there back yard is a shed with an old dollhouse in it. Guess what? The dollhouse looks exactly like the Amityville house. Of course with demons included. Now, I hope your still with me, they have a little girl. It's her birthday. What better birthday present for a child than a dollhouse from hell. The events that follow really shake this family up. The fireplace with the dimmer switch in the living room acts up. A giant mouse crawls under the little girls bed. The parents have a sex scene in the middle of all of this. It's like the pool scene from 'Showgirls' in hell. The older brother takes his girlfriend to the shed in the backyard for sex, and of course there is a mounted insect in there that comes to life! During sex it bites the girl in the-- well, lets not go there. You have to see it to believe it! When it attacks the guy needle nose pliers come into the picture. After seeing this film, and changing my shorts I just had to write a review. All I can say is that when all this is done, in the last scene of the movie you'll think to yourself,""Thank God they have a pick-up truck!"" Pay close attention to the closing credits and you'll see (I'm not making this up) that the director has an assistant director, who has a 2nd assistant director, who has a 2nd 2nd assistant director! It took all these guys to make this. Did I mention the burning girlfriend? Or the lusting mom? How about the little boy pounding stakes into dads feet? I'm going to watch 'The Waltons Homecoming' now.

The special affects team should be fired for doing such a terrible job at it, if one can call that special affects. I call it a joke.
