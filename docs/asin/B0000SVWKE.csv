And the little man who takes them on also takes them down with nothing more than a little common sense and a knowledge of the law.The film also provides an off-beat romance of sorts between the leads.The ignorance, stupidity and non-funny humor I expected were happily not present in this film.  Luckily, these filmmakers and screenwriters knew their material and knew exactly where to stick their pins.The churchmen may have reacted with more self-reflection than is credible, and the judge certainly did; but maybe showing this type of sensible behavior will lead these authoritarian personalities into a more tolerant, self-critical position.Entertaining and gratifying.",5,Recommended,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,880,"['insurance', 'companies', 'financial', 'industry', 'churches', 'poor', 'people', 'who', 'support', 'media', 'who', 'sing', 'words', 'powerful', 'are', 'villains', 'piece', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'down', 'nothing', 'more', 'little', 'common', 'sense', 'knowledge', 'law.The', 'film', 'also', 'off-beat', 'romance', 'sorts', 'leads.The', 'ignorance', 'stupidity', 'non-funny', 'humor', 'expected', 'were', 'happily', 'not', 'present', 'film', 'Luckily', 'filmmakers', 'screenwriters', 'knew', 'material', 'knew', 'exactly', 'where', 'stick', 'pins.The', 'churchmen', 'may', 'have', 'reacted', 'more', 'self-reflection', 'credible', 'judge', 'certainly', 'did', 'maybe', 'showing', 'type', 'sensible', 'behavior', 'will', 'lead', 'authoritarian', 'personalities', 'more', 'tolerant', 'self-critical', 'position.Entertaining', 'gratifying']",The Man Who Sued God

He is a retired attorney in Australia and he has decided to cash in all his money to live a happy peaceful life upon his boat.  Unfortunately his boat is destroyed in a strong thunder storm.  He figures, no problem I'll talk to my insurance fella and get this cleared up.  If you ever had your insurance claim denied you will relate when he is told that it was an act of God.  So he decides to sue God to recoup his losses.  To sue God, you sue his trusty earthly servants, the only way that they can win the case is to prove that God doesn't exist?  There is a very uncomfortable problem.The movie does not make fun of the church or God.  His real beef is with insurnace companies using God as a loophole.  It's clever, and witty.  Judy Davis is great as Anna, and Billy Connolly is always a good time.  Is this the best ever legal movie, no.

And if you are an attorney you'll probably cringe when you see the practicing attorneys in the ""big City"" try to defend the Almighty when Steve decides to sue God since his claim for lightning that destroys his boat is considered ""an Act of God"".  But the rest of us will really enjoy this light hearted ""fish out of water"" (no pun intended little film that reminds me of the joy of first seeing ""Local Hero"".The film was produced by Australian TV and Showtime Australia. So, yes, it was made for TV but it was a CABLE network so we get to hear the F-word and the S-word a lot. No nudity at all and not even a sex joke. No this isn't an Academy Award caliber film but it's a heck of a lot better than most of what's on television and stars Billy Connolly (sometimes too over the top) and Judy Davis (who starts out looking unattractive and strange but grows on you) work well together.The one think that drops the DVD at least one star is that the US releasing company did not reformat the image for US TVs. Though it's wide-screen letterboxed, the original film was VERY wide-screen. As the opening titles appear, you'll wonder why the actors, the Producers, and the Director only have first names! It's because at least 10% is cut off from each side of the screen. This also affects the main body of the film because there are signs, which are part of the plot, that can't be read. Remember ""pan and scan""? Well, this would have been a good place to use it.So, for some light entertainment, with an interesting premise - ""if there is no God to sure, where does that leave organized religion?"" - I recommend this film.Steve Ramm ""Anything Phonographic""",4,An Entertaining Film (with a formatting defect),1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,1848,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'casualty', 'claim', 'denied', 'insurance', 'company', 'will', 'certainly', 'relate', 'Steve', 'Irish', 'lawyer', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'practice', 'lobster', 'fishing', 'small', 'town', 'Australia', 'are', 'attorney', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'cringe', 'when', 'see', 'practicing', 'attorneys', 'big', 'City', 'try', 'defend', 'Almighty', 'when', 'Steve', 'sue', 'God', 'claim', 'lightning', 'boat', 'considered', 'Act', 'God', 'rest', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'light', 'hearted', 'fish', 'water', 'pun', 'intended', 'little', 'film', 'joy', 'first', 'seeing', 'Local', 'Hero', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Australian', 'TV', 'Showtime', 'Australia', 'So', 'yes', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'was', 'CABLE', 'network', 'so', 'get', 'hear', 'F-word', 'S-word', 'lot', 'nudity', 'not', 'even', 'sex', 'joke', 'No', ""n't"", 'Academy', 'Award', 'caliber', 'film', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'television', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'sometimes', 'too', 'top', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'who', 'out', 'looking', 'unattractive', 'strange', 'work', 'well', 'together.The', 'one', 'think', 'DVD', 'least', 'one', 'star', 'US', 'releasing', 'company', 'did', 'not', 'reformat', 'image', 'US', 'TVs', 'wide-screen', 'letterboxed', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'VERY', 'wide-screen', 'opening', 'titles', 'appear', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'actors', 'Producers', 'Director', 'only', 'have', 'first', 'names', 'because', 'least', '10', '%', 'cut', 'off', 'side', 'screen', 'also', 'main', 'body', 'film', 'are', 'signs', 'are', 'part', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'read', 'Remember', 'pan', 'scan', 'Well', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'place', 'use', 'it.So', 'light', 'entertainment', 'interesting', 'premise', 'God', 'sure', 'where', 'leave', 'organized', 'religion', 'recommend', 'film.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Man Who Sued God
