The series dealt with issues which  actually happened in the past year, making the shows surreal to watch, knowing they were filmed several years ago.  The dialog was quick and funny and touching and intelligent.  The actors brought their characters to life with depth and grace.  Series like this are few and much too far between.  Other than &#34;The Good Wife&#34; there is no other current series that comes anywhere close to matching this one.

838964,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0002KRTW0,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[214, 226]","This season saw the end of a bright but sadly short-lived era. The West Wing was THE show to watch for four glorious years. There are those out there who might say that the show somehow lost steam in the final year of the Sorkin era, but I say unto you, listen not to them. When a highly regarded show undergoes (or is about to undergo) a major change, it is nitpicked to a great extent, and some people feel compelled to invent problems with it, for whatever reason. It is fortunate for the non-crazy, then, that this year proved so able to produce challenging, powerful drama. This season opens with presidential politics in full swing, President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) campaigning for a second term facing a suspiciously Dubya-looking Republican contender portrayed by James Brolin (okay, he's more like a Bush caricature). After several great campaign-themed episodes at the season's beginning, politics-as-unusual would once again turn up in the halls of power at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.This season's biggest change was Rob Lowe's departure from the show, but that was alright, because we got the super-talented Joshua Malina to replace him. We met Toby's and CJ's dads in ""Holy Night"" and ""The Long Goodbye"", respectively. The former continues in the show's tradition of powerful, moving Christmas episodes, the latter is a greatly underrated family drama centering around CJ and her Alzheimer's-stricken father. These episodes pack plenty of emotional power, and there were other great episodes like ""20 Hours in America,"" which tracked Josh, Toby and Donna through Indiana after they lost the motorcade, and ""Life on Mars,"" which led to the departure of John Hoynes as Vice President, thanks to Matthew Perry's guest turn as Joe Quincy. These episodes, in addition to the pulse-pounding final two shows of the season, were only a few of a memorable and  consistent year of television that called to mind the show's first season--no grand arcs, just stories and characters and the delightful political mess the White House staff would sort through on a weekly basis. This season brought the series back to its roots and was an appropriate send-off for one of the medium's masters, although it's sad indeed that the send-off in question was needed in the first place.

The series became such a hit that some pollsters claimed that certain people actually believed Jed Bartlet was the real president (although, if true, this is more of a negative reflection on the intelligence of the electorate, and not necessarily an indication of West Wing's realism). But regardless, the truth of the matter is that West Wing definitely strikes a chord with certain audiences, providing entertaining brew of action, suspense, and drama on a weekly basis...Seasoned Hollywood actor Martin Sheen plays the lead role of President Jed Bartlet. The day-to-day affairs of Bartlet's administration are run by a number of individuals who surround him, among them are: Claudia ""C.J."" Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), and Charlie Young (Dule Hill). West Wing follows these dedicated staffers as they work extended hours behind-the-scenes to help keep the White House running smoothly. Along the way, the stress of the job and the characters' personal lives make for an interesting glimpse into what many believe is an accurate portrayal of a real-life White House administration...The West Wing (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""20 Hours in America: Part 1"" in which a number of events take place - Toby, Josh, and Donna get left behind on a campaign stop in Indiana (spending the rest of their day trying to get back to Washington), Bartlet searches for Mrs. Landingham's replacement, and the Dow Jones index plummets. Meanwhile, an opposition campaign stirs up the media when Bartlet's wife claims she's ""just a wife and mother""... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Election Night"" in which the staffers eagerly await the results of the presidential contest (each in his own unique way), and ""The Long Goodbye"" in which C.J. returns to her hometown of Dayton where she attends her high school reunion and struggles with the horrid effects of her father's Alzheimer's disease...Below is a list of episodes included on the West Wing (Season 4) DVD:Episode 66 (20 Hours in America: Part 1)Episode 67 (20 Hours in America: Part 2)Episode 68 (College Kids)Episode 69 (The Red Mass)Episode 70 (Debate Camp)Episode 71 (Game On)Episode 72 (Election Night)Episode 73 (Process Stories)Episode 74 (Swiss Diplomacy)Episode 75 (Arctic Radar)Episode 76 (Holy Night)Episode 77 (Guns Not Butter)Episode 78 (The Long Goodbye)Episode 79 (Inauguration: Part 1)Episode 80 (Inauguration: Part 2)Episode 81 (The California 47th)Episode 82 (Red Haven's on Fire)Episode 83 (Privateers)Episode 84 (Angel Maintenance)Episode 85 (Evidence of Things Not Seen)Episode 86 (Life on Mars)Episode 87 (Commencement)Episode 88 (Twenty Five)The DVD Report",5,A fascinating TV series...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2983,"['Premiering', 'September', '1999', 'original', 'NBC', 'series', 'West', 'Wing', 'built', 'instant', 'cult', 'following', 'seemingly', 'realistic', 'weekly', 'excursions', 'inner', 'sanctums', 'White', 'House', 'series', 'became', 'such', 'hit', 'pollsters', 'claimed', 'certain', 'people', 'actually', 'believed', 'Jed', 'Bartlet', 'was', 'real', 'president', 'true', 'more', 'negative', 'reflection', 'intelligence', 'electorate', 'not', 'necessarily', 'indication', 'West', 'Wing', 'realism', 'regardless', 'truth', 'matter', 'West', 'Wing', 'definitely', 'chord', 'certain', 'audiences', 'providing', 'entertaining', 'brew', 'action', 'suspense', 'drama', 'weekly', 'basis', 'Seasoned', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'lead', 'role', 'President', 'Jed', 'Bartlet', 'day-to-day', 'affairs', 'Bartlet', 'administration', 'are', 'run', 'number', 'individuals', 'who', 'surround', 'are', 'Claudia', 'C.J', 'Cregg', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Sam', 'Seaborn', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Toby', 'Ziegler', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'Leo', 'McGarry', 'John', 'Spencer', 'Charlie', 'Young', 'Dule', 'Hill', 'West', 'Wing', 'dedicated', 'staffers', 'work', 'extended', 'hours', 'behind-the-scenes', 'help', 'keep', 'White', 'House', 'running', 'smoothly', 'way', 'stress', 'job', 'characters', 'personal', 'lives', 'make', 'interesting', 'glimpse', 'what', 'many', 'believe', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'real-life', 'White', 'House', 'administration', 'West', 'Wing', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', '20', 'Hours', 'America', 'Part', '1', 'number', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'Toby', 'Josh', 'Donna', 'get', 'left', 'behind', 'campaign', 'stop', 'Indiana', 'spending', 'rest', 'day', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'Washington', 'Bartlet', 'Mrs.', 'Landingham', 'replacement', 'Dow', 'Jones', 'index', 'plummets', 'Meanwhile', 'opposition', 'campaign', 'up', 'media', 'when', 'Bartlet', 'wife', 'just', 'wife', 'mother', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'include', 'Election', 'Night', 'staffers', 'eagerly', 'await', 'results', 'presidential', 'contest', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'Long', 'Goodbye', 'C.J', 'returns', 'hometown', 'Dayton', 'where', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'horrid', 'effects', 'father', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'West', 'Wing', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '66', '20', 'Hours', 'America', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '67', '20', 'Hours', 'America', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '68', 'College', 'Kids', 'Episode', '69', 'Red', 'Mass', 'Episode', '70', 'Debate', 'Camp', 'Episode', '71', 'Game', 'Episode', '72', 'Election', 'Night', 'Episode', '73', 'Process', 'Stories', 'Episode', '74', 'Swiss', 'Diplomacy', 'Episode', '75', 'Arctic', 'Radar', 'Episode', '76', 'Holy', 'Night', 'Episode', '77', 'Guns', 'Not', 'Butter', 'Episode', '78', 'Long', 'Goodbye', 'Episode', '79', 'Inauguration', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '80', 'Inauguration', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '81', 'California', '47th', 'Episode', '82', 'Red', 'Haven', 'Fire', 'Episode', '83', 'Privateers', 'Episode', '84', 'Angel', 'Maintenance', 'Episode', '85', 'Evidence', 'Things', 'Not', 'Seen', 'Episode', '86', 'Life', 'Mars', 'Episode', '87', 'Commencement', 'Episode', '88', 'Twenty', 'Five', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

838980,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0002KRTW0,Craig MACKINNON,"[6, 6]","On first viewing, this was my favourite season of the West Wing.  Each show had something that kept your interest and held it through the commercial breaks, and that same feeling of ""needing"" to know what happens next carried between shows as well.  True, there are a number of ""soap opera"" developments in this season: the clash between Charlie and Jean-Paul (Zoey's French boyfriend), Toby's ex-wife's pregnancy, etc.  Thankfully they are incorporated into the fabric of the political commentary of the show: Andy's single-Mom pregnancy makes her a target for the Christian Right, and Zoey's choice in a boyfriend leads to the spectacular cliffhanger.For my money, the Season 4 cliffhanger is the best, even better than the assassination attempt after Season 1.  It is spun out over several shows, and the tension builds to an almost unbearable level.  The payoff in Season 5 is not up to the challenge, unfortunately, perhaps because of the staff turnover between the two seasons.  There are a number of good guest stars, some neat story ideas, and of course, the President's butt-kicking of Sen. Ritchie in the debate and the election.  The season is solid or better every single episode.Unfortunately, this season also bids adieu to Rob Lowe, Aaron Sorkin, and Tommy Schlamme.  Rob Lowe's departure is especially problematic in a continuity sense: much as Mandy (the spin doctor) vanishes into thin air between the Season 1 cliffhanger and the Season 2 premier, so too does Sam Seaborn dissappear into the void of Orange County when running for Congress.  One episode, he's got Toby and CJ running his campaign, the next show everyone (except Sam) is back in the West Wing with no mention of the outcome of the election.  Are we supposed to believe that (a) he won the election in spite of being 10 points down the previous episode or (b) he was not offered his old job at the White House back despite the President's assurance?

There are 4 or 5 that are a little slower, though, including one where essentially no suspense is generated for an entire episode because a landing gear light doesn't come on on Air Force One.The high points are very high, though, and include the annual Christmas episode (strong in EVERY season of this multiple-emmy winning show).  Another high point comes when newcomer Will Bailey talks the President into a new foreign policy that includes military intervention for humanitarian reasons.

The West Wing is hands down one of the best programs to ever grace our television air waves. This Season IV, had some interesting plots and were handled deftly with a correctness and ethic that is lacking in many of our today's Politically Correct circles. The entire ensemble cast has made this multi Emmy winning show a remarkable representation of what Government should be, how morally and ethicly our Country should be run. The West Wing should be required watching for all high school senior economics classes. The writing and research that went in to producing this show along with the accuracy required to bring all the nuances of the real West Wing to the screen leaves me in awe. I have been trying to get some ideas for a book of my own down. Until your there doing it yourself, you don't realize how much more goes in to the process. It is not just writing the words, it's making sure that everything is accurate and substantiated with all the correct details. This is where this series shines.

But, because the previous standard was so high, even when things go off the boil this still makes for compelling viewing. This series follows the latter stages of the Presidential campaign and inauguration, Sam Seaborn leaves to run for office in California, troops are sent in to quell a Kundunese (an African nation) genocide, some marines are captured and need to be rescued, there is industrial whistle-blowing, a friendly fire incident, another administration scandal and the aforementioned end of series cliff hanger. This series focuses more on long running storylines, rather than the individual stories for each episode and it loses some of it's spark as a result. The snappy, intelligent language is still there and the political manoeuvrings are just as impressive, but because the series focuses on long running themes it seems to have lost some of it's fire and immediacy. Everyone acts to the high standards this series became known for, the writing is still top class and there are real episode highlights throughout the series and if you enjoy the previous series' then this will interest you and keep you engaged. Despite my earlier reservations this still manages to be very impressive TV!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,West Wing 4,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1431,"['West', 'Wing', 'Season', 'Four', 'exceptional', 'end', 'series', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'where', 'things', 'started', 'go', 'off', 'boil', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'previous', 'standard', 'was', 'so', 'high', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'boil', 'still', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'series', 'latter', 'stages', 'Presidential', 'campaign', 'inauguration', 'Sam', 'Seaborn', 'run', 'office', 'California', 'troops', 'are', 'sent', 'quell', 'Kundunese', 'African', 'nation', 'genocide', 'marines', 'are', 'captured', 'need', 'be', 'rescued', 'industrial', 'whistle-blowing', 'friendly', 'fire', 'incident', 'administration', 'scandal', 'aforementioned', 'end', 'series', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'series', 'more', 'long', 'running', 'storylines', 'rather', 'individual', 'stories', 'episode', 'spark', 'result', 'snappy', 'intelligent', 'language', 'still', 'political', 'manoeuvrings', 'are', 'just', 'impressive', 'series', 'long', 'running', 'themes', 'have', 'lost', 'fire', 'immediacy', 'Everyone', 'high', 'standards', 'series', 'became', 'known', 'writing', 'still', 'top', 'class', 'are', 'real', 'episode', 'highlights', 'series', 'enjoy', 'previous', 'series', 'then', 'will', 'interest', 'keep', 'engaged', 'earlier', 'reservations', 'still', 'be', 'very', 'impressive', 'TV', 'Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A
