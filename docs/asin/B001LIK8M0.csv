An absolutely incredible scene alone can make a movie for me. With the DVD, we can enjoy just that scene and move onto the next movie to avoid the ennui.  That said, there is a clown scene in this movie that is very well done.  It parallels the infamous Poltergeist clown scene to some degree, but takes on a great life of its own.  If you enjoy horror, and let yourself be scared, this scene will certainly do it for you.  The rest of the movie is pretty good though; some neat twists and generally spooky atmosphere make the entire movie a fun watch.

At least that is the story line for Amusement.  Three girls all connected by a childhood friendship, and a creepy little boy, are thrown together in this horror movie.Something happened when they were kids, and now each girl is suffering a fate they determined for themselves a long time ago.  If you are really interested in seeing the movie, be assured that I will not spoil anything.  The opening credits let you know who these people are, and how they are connected.So why only 2 stars?  Well, honestly it is a bad film.  It is a waste of time.  It is long (which is sad for like 87 minutes) and tedious.  The opening scene is too long and does not make any sense.  Where did all these people come from?  Why the obsession with convoys?  Why entwine other people without explanation?  The second segment gave this movie its 2 star rating.  While still poorly done, it was by far the best part (which is not saying much).  But clowns are always scary.  Although, this segment too left me with questions: how did he know she'd be there, etc, etc?  And the last segment was just unbelievable, over the top.  Why is it in horror movie world, no one calls the police?  Why is it even a disturbed psycho takes on immortality or invincibility?

1214301,A31A9GENAJYD64,B001LIK8M0,David M. Rossi,"[1, 2]","Many reviewers here are missing one important point about Amusement: reminiscent atmosphere. The opening sequence screams of creepiness a-la Joy Ride and of course, tries to manage a surprise twist on the idea. (Anyone who knows horror movies will see it coming.) The clown scene is actually better, with some suspense, false jumps and eerie camera angles, making the clown doll/costume appear even scarier than the movie's cover pic. Our laugher's lair is a blend of the house from Psycho and a run down version of the overlook hotel from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. That dining room with it's board room style table and antique chairs had me wondering when we were going to begin seeing the laugher having conversations with a long dead mother or hallucinating over prior years' guests and chopping down doors with fire axes(didn't happen, as earlier in the movie during the clown scene, he was tearing down a door in a slightly new way)The ending actually wasn't as bad as what other reviewers said either, with some decent suspense, but a surprisingly lacking end to our villain due to his forgetfulness to put away his toys. (and a damn nice toy, from the earlier clown scene)Now normally, if a movie exhibited such a low level of ability to tell a new story I would be giving it one or no stars, but in spite of the fact that the filmmakers chose not to give a lot of back story to our villain to better explain his motives as to why he chooses to emulate horror movie scenes in real life, this film does work to a degree. Whether the people involved with the production are horror fans who were paying homage to their favorite scenes or trying to fix things they saw wrong with other movies (who didn't want to see that truck driver from Joy Ride get his skull bashed in by the end of the first movie?) they managed to do all of the scenes in Amusement with a great deal of style and attention to detail, often lacking in horror movies with a low budget. It somehow manages not to stink of unoriginal theft. It's as if they know all of the elements that make up the scares of a good horror movie, but are lacking in the character development department. I couldn't help thinking of The Dentist and Dr. Giggles every time our nutcase laugher let loose, but how did he gain access to the lair and the knowledge to create such a dark, foreboding place? Even Dr Giggles had a bit more of a history than a guy in a surgeon's mask slicing people to ribbons with his scalpel. So now the real question arises, if they made another, would I see a sequel to Amusement?

1214306,A20L3YKLJA2G95,B001LIK8M0,Jay,"[25, 28]","When a horror movie posts a creepy looking clown on the cover odds are I'm going to check it out. When looking at scary movies with clowns only Clownhouse, It, & Killer Klowns from Outer Space are real standouts for my taste. Despite that fact I still tend to check out all these weak clown horror attempts in hopes of finding a classic. Unfortunately in this case the clown on the cover was something to lure you in since it only played a role for about 10 minutes of the film. I've noticed this is a pretty common complaint about the film and overall will aid in more negative reviews.The film turns out to consist of a few different poorly written stories all tying together at the end. The first story is about a girl Shelby & her boyfriend rob as they become part of a disastrous convey trip. The second is the best part of the film where the clown appears for the first and only time while a girl named Tabitha is babysitting. The third installment is a girl Lisa who goes home with a guy after a night at the bar to never come home again. Now all the girls in the stories wind up being linked through a ridiculous situation back in elementary school along with their killer.It's pretty much a waste of an hour and a half with very few enjoyable parts. The killer himself is so pathetic there is no way you could find him scary. He has this annoying laugh he does through that becomes so annoying you want jump through the tv and strangle him. It wasn't all terrible though thanks to the girls in the story. All 3 actresses did a really solid job with Tabitha(Katheryn Winnick) leading the pack by being the most believable. The clown segment itself was pretty creepy and should have been the premise for the entire film. If they had focused primarily on the killer being dressed up as the clown the film would've had a better chance at success.",2,The Cover drew me in but the film didn't deliver,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,1851,"['When', 'horror', 'movie', 'creepy', 'looking', 'clown', 'cover', 'odds', 'are', ""'m"", 'going', 'check', 'out', 'When', 'looking', 'scary', 'movies', 'clowns', 'only', 'Clownhouse', 'Killer', 'Klowns', 'Outer', 'Space', 'are', 'real', 'standouts', 'taste', 'fact', 'still', 'tend', 'check', 'out', 'weak', 'clown', 'horror', 'attempts', 'hopes', 'finding', 'classic', 'Unfortunately', 'case', 'clown', 'cover', 'was', 'something', 'lure', 'only', 'played', 'role', '10', 'minutes', 'film', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'pretty', 'common', 'complaint', 'film', 'overall', 'will', 'aid', 'more', 'negative', 'reviews.The', 'film', 'out', 'consist', 'few', 'different', 'poorly', 'written', 'stories', 'tying', 'together', 'end', 'first', 'story', 'girl', 'Shelby', 'boyfriend', 'rob', 'become', 'part', 'disastrous', 'convey', 'trip', 'second', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'clown', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'girl', 'named', 'Tabitha', 'babysitting', 'third', 'installment', 'girl', 'Lisa', 'who', 'home', 'guy', 'night', 'bar', 'never', 'come', 'home', 'again', 'Now', 'girls', 'stories', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'linked', 'ridiculous', 'situation', 'back', 'elementary', 'school', 'killer.It', 'pretty', 'much', 'waste', 'hour', 'half', 'very', 'few', 'enjoyable', 'parts', 'killer', 'so', 'pathetic', 'way', 'could', 'find', 'scary', 'annoying', 'so', 'annoying', 'want', 'jump', 'tv', 'strangle', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'thanks', 'girls', 'story', '3', 'actresses', 'did', 'really', 'solid', 'job', 'Tabitha', 'Katheryn', 'Winnick', 'leading', 'pack', 'being', 'most', 'believable', 'clown', 'segment', 'was', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'premise', 'entire', 'film', 'had', 'focused', 'primarily', 'killer', 'being', 'dressed', 'up', 'clown', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'better', 'chance', 'success']",Amusement

Hensley ""Thomas Hensley &#34;B-Ho...","[1, 2]","Hmmm...I can easily see this little Horror flick being forgotten about over time as with so many other Horror gems that I've come to appreciate (some sooner than others), in time.  The reason I can see 'Amusement' forgotten about, is because this giggly, Dr. Giggles-sounding  villain is NOT so much iconic in the world of so many great Horror characters.  This killer is an average looking/size person.  Maybe that's why I like this.  Also, the way this story has been stitched together has been done before.  Plus, there is no mystery except for the question I have.  Well, You'll know who the killer is and you know mostly who his victims are.  This flick gives all of that information right up front.  The only mystery is that you don't know how this killer will achieve his ""amusing"" goals!  I do like the wicked little laugh coming from the killer.  It's true, you can either hate this laugh (which is heard throughout the feature), and let it ruin the whole flick, or you can enjoy it because it fits its title so perfectly.  I will have to agree with most of the critics on here about the clown scene!  Loved it!!!  There are quite a few scenes I loved.I do have a question on some of those locations that the killer manages to use for his sick game.  Were those locations inherited???  Was he from a rich family of entertainers???  He did say he came from a long history of performers and entertainers.  I just don't see how he managed to rig up some of those things.  This is mainly the second half of the film that I'm questioning.  All horrific locations, by the way.  Not big on gore but does have some blood here and there.

Which works here except for the ending perhaps. This killer reminded me of a young dr. giggles and mad serial killer and yes such giggling madmen do exist, my friend worked in a lunatic asylum and supersmart giggling killers were not safe to be around alone to say the least.  The blu ray looks great here with no extras to be had but the picture is great. We know who the killer is and why he is doing what he is doing but this flick has the feel of a first time director in some ways, that being said it's still miles above many d level horror flicks I have seen, it's slick and well shot. The acting is done by a better group than a c or d movie like lets say 'demonic'. This movie does have a trule inspired clown scene too ,just like the cover. However this isn't a house of traps movie, it does have them to be sure but they are not picking off characters like in ""SAW"".  I have to give this movie kudos for having a young killer played by a talented actor who pulls it off nicely. He's creepy and weird and yet believable, the rest of cast isn't well developed but then in these movies  people get chased around and there's little time for a backstory usually.  The ending was a little disjointed as a character escapes the mansion and ends up out in the country in another house. You just have to suspend your disbelief I guess and take it for granted that the two places are connected underground but that would a very long tunnel system! This fact didn't detour me from enjoying this little horror film at least it's professionally done on good film stock and not video tape like we had alot of back in the 80's. This film is in more horror collection and it's not a bad movie, a nonhorror fan may give this over the top in some cases movie one star for things like dissapearing characters but that's ok , we know he killed them off even though it didn't show what happened to them. The Shelby characters boyfriend and another female prisoner are captured but their fates are not shown. Still we know they are dead other movies would have shown the audience this fact though.

And personally, I've always liked this kind of tripartite structure, whether the three separate stories interconnect at the end (as is the case with this film), or connect only through an actor or general theme (as with my favorite, 1955's excellent ""Three Cases of Murder"").  I was entertained by ""Amusement:"" it is not just a flick to help waste your time, and the folks involved in its making clearly wanted to make a good movie, despite the budget.As mentioned, ""Amusement"" consists of three stories with somewhat open endings, all three of which are resolved in a common d&eacute;nouement at the end.  Other than the first story, which I felt was the weakest of the bunch, ""Amusement"" is mostly carried by the main actor, Katheryn Winnick.  Despite her demure clothing throughout, Winnick is decidedly more Playboy-bunny (well, a very athletic bunny -- she is after all a Taekwondo champion) than ordinary-girl-next-door, and at first I thought she was slightly mis-cast.  I was wrong -- not only does she give a truly solid performance (notably better than the norm in these sorts of roles), her inherent sexuality seemed to enhance the sense of a strong, tough woman who will survive no matter what.  Winnick is much more than eye candy here; she actually carries the film.The sets deserve a special mention -- they are above the norm.

1214320,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B001LIK8M0,Sid the Elf,"[2, 4]","When the cover of a horror film sports a very creepy clown you are always tempted to check it out. The idea of the murderous circus character draws any horror fan in no matter how bad it will most likely be. The first really great clown film (in our opinion) came out in 1989 called Clownhouse which was shortly followed by the far more popular film IT, spawning a new breed of horror appealing to all those freaked out by our face painted friends. Which brings us to our feature of the evening Amusement. The cover will be slightly misleading since it's not about a killer clown, just more of a deranged loser who happened to be Todd in Wedding Crashers.The film was done a little different and broken up into three pieces centered around 3 girls Tabitha, Shelby, & Lisa. The first up is Shelby and her boyfriend Rob as they get involved in a convey trip that goes bad. The next is Tabitha who has the best part in the film. In her's she is babysitting her two nephews when she has to fight for her life against the clown on the cover. By far this as creepy as it gets. Third up is Lisa who leaves a bar with a guy and never returns forcing her friend to go searching for her. All these stories wind up coming together for the ending in which you find the girls all were close friends in elementary school. They all went their separate ways but are reunited one more time as they try to survive the evil Todd.Overall this wasn't great but wasn't terrible either. The acting was actually great from the three girls, especially Tabitha. It really made the film much easier to enjoy despite the confusion and plot holes. There are some parts you will have abandon questions you have and just go with the flow. The killer really doesn't have a scary quality to him besides his annoying laugh. He doesn't draw you in making you feel a true sense of worry, nor is his motive for wanting to murder the girls anything special. With all that said Amusement would be worth checking out but not buying since you won't feel the need to watch it again.",3,The wierd kid from wedding crashers just got a little more bizarre,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,2040,"['When', 'cover', 'horror', 'film', 'sports', 'very', 'creepy', 'clown', 'are', 'always', 'tempted', 'check', 'out', 'idea', 'murderous', 'circus', 'character', 'horror', 'fan', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'first', 'really', 'great', 'clown', 'film', 'opinion', 'came', 'out', '1989', 'called', 'Clownhouse', 'was', 'shortly', 'followed', 'far', 'more', 'popular', 'film', 'IT', 'spawning', 'new', 'breed', 'horror', 'appealing', 'freaked', 'out', 'face', 'painted', 'friends', 'Which', 'feature', 'evening', 'Amusement', 'cover', 'will', 'be', 'slightly', 'misleading', 'not', 'killer', 'clown', 'just', 'more', 'deranged', 'loser', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'Todd', 'Wedding', 'Crashers.The', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'little', 'different', 'broken', 'up', 'three', 'pieces', 'centered', '3', 'girls', 'Tabitha', 'Shelby', 'Lisa', 'first', 'up', 'Shelby', 'boyfriend', 'Rob', 'get', 'involved', 'convey', 'trip', 'bad', 'next', 'Tabitha', 'who', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'babysitting', 'two', 'nephews', 'when', 'fight', 'life', 'clown', 'cover', 'far', 'as', 'creepy', 'Third', 'up', 'Lisa', 'who', 'bar', 'guy', 'never', 'returns', 'forcing', 'friend', 'go', 'searching', 'stories', 'wind', 'up', 'coming', 'together', 'ending', 'find', 'girls', 'were', 'close', 'friends', 'elementary', 'school', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'are', 'reunited', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'try', 'survive', 'evil', 'Todd.Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'either', 'acting', 'was', 'actually', 'great', 'three', 'girls', 'especially', 'Tabitha', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'easier', 'enjoy', 'confusion', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'parts', 'will', 'have', 'abandon', 'questions', 'have', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'killer', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'scary', 'quality', 'annoying', 'laugh', ""n't"", 'draw', 'making', 'feel', 'true', 'sense', 'worry', 'motive', 'wanting', 'murder', 'girls', 'anything', 'special', 'said', 'Amusement', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'not', 'buying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'watch', 'again']",Amusement
1214321,A1LHG5OXT6AJZ8,B001LIK8M0,S. McGee,"[5, 6]","This is another unfortunate example of better-than-average horror films being shunted off a theatrical release schedule, while we have to suffer through other films of a lesser quality. Amusement, while it was indeed sparingly advertised as a horror film, can be viewed more as a thriller than anything else. Presented as three connected shorts before merging into one story in the last act, the film tells the tale of a deeply disturbed villain unleashing a well-planned act of vengeance against three young women from his past.The film is fun and has some surprisingly clever moments, but at the same time it does ask the viewer to put a lot of thought into the motivations of the villain. This is something that isn't common in slasher films (which Amusement does turn into towards the end, at least to a point), and as such unless you're prepared to wax philosophical after the credits finish rolling this may not be the right movie for you.Aside from its quirks Amusement sports solid acting from most of its cast, in particular Kier O'Donnell who provides a chilling villain in The Laugh. One of the film's weakest points, however, happens to be what little gore is used in the film. For a movie that prides itself on atmosphere and set-pieces, the completely CGI gore scenes are jarring and quite honestly detract from the movie. Things would've been smoother had they taken the time to use old-school makeup effects to bring the violence to life.Overall, despite the disjointed plot and over-reliance on CGI to provide the movie's scarce visceral shocks, Amusement stands as fun way to spend 85 min.",3,"Sometimes Clever, but Fun",1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,1607,"['unfortunate', 'example', 'better-than-average', 'horror', 'films', 'being', 'shunted', 'off', 'theatrical', 'release', 'schedule', 'have', 'suffer', 'other', 'films', 'lesser', 'quality', 'Amusement', 'was', 'indeed', 'sparingly', 'advertised', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'more', 'thriller', 'anything', 'else', 'Presented', 'three', 'connected', 'shorts', 'merging', 'one', 'story', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'tale', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'villain', 'unleashing', 'well-planned', 'act', 'vengeance', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'past.The', 'film', 'fun', 'surprisingly', 'clever', 'moments', 'same', 'time', 'ask', 'viewer', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'motivations', 'villain', 'something', ""n't"", 'common', 'slasher', 'films', 'Amusement', 'turn', 'towards', 'end', 'least', 'point', 'such', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'wax', 'philosophical', 'credits', 'finish', 'rolling', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'movie', 'you.Aside', 'quirks', 'Amusement', 'sports', 'solid', 'acting', 'most', 'cast', 'particular', 'Kier', ""O'Donnell"", 'who', 'chilling', 'villain', 'Laugh', 'One', 'film', 'weakest', 'points', 'however', 'be', 'what', 'little', 'gore', 'used', 'film', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'set-pieces', 'completely', 'CGI', 'gore', 'scenes', 'are', 'jarring', 'quite', 'honestly', 'detract', 'movie', 'Things', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'smoother', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'use', 'old-school', 'makeup', 'effects', 'bring', 'violence', 'life.Overall', 'disjointed', 'plot', 'over-reliance', 'CGI', 'provide', 'movie', 'scarce', 'visceral', 'shocks', 'Amusement', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', '85', 'min']",Amusement

1214323,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B001LIK8M0,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","Amusement is an imaginatively put-together movie - it starts off seeming like an anthology movie, only one whose portions are more like end-slices of full-length films rather than individual stories.  Then it starts drawing these pieces in together until you have the full story unfold.  It taps on elements familiar from such movies as Friday The 13th to House Of Wax to Trick R Treat to Saw, creating a whole that's very well-produced, original, sexy, and with genuine shock moments that don't telegraph themselves a mile away, or even an inch away.  Personally, I think a movie like this - where it's the intention that you don't figure out the actual connecting story until about half-way through - is best watched with as little foreknowledge as possible, and for anyone already considering getting this I'd advise you to stop reading and just go ahead and get it - if you're into horror, you won't likely be disappointed.However, most people are going to want a bit more to go on, so I'll elaborate a bit, first with my usual warning.***WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD*****The various seemingly unrelated segments are connected by a common past shared by at least one character in each segment - a past in which they each came into contact with a demented individual who's now tracking each of them down.  The killer likes to play games with his targets, but it's not just another variation on the widely influential Saw theme where the victims are trapped and challenged to survive tests.  In this case, it's elaborate scenarios that the targets don't even know Are set-ups orchestrated by the killer, often where the disguised killer himself is playing a role completely unbeknownest to any of the other people involved.  Often there's nothing at all to indicate that events are being manipulated.A couple of these sceanrios, admittedly, have flaws from a story stand-point.  Some are very believable, but at other times coincidence plays too large a role, and in at least one case it's difficult to see how the character in question could have walked into the circumstances without major alarm bells being set off.  So how much of a hinderance is it to the whole movie?  Not very much, really.  A little bit of retooling could have probably eliminated most of the problem; and if you want to think about it a bit it's not too hard to come up with a ""Well, maybe if..."" explanation as to how a seemingly nonfeasible situation could have actually  worked, perhaps with events that simply took place offscreen.  When you're this good, if your biggest fault is that it calls for a bit of conjecture on the part of the viewer to fit a couple of the pieces together, that's not too big a problem.  Ninety per cent of Amusement is very well crafted and thought out, only about ten per cent affected by some plot holes.As for what it's got right - original concept and (mostly) highly skillful execution, fine acting, good solid production values, freaky visual imagery, nice characteriztion, high-quality special effects, gorgeous female cast members, genuine suspense and a couple of real jolts.

1214326,A9HB18W9DAC1V,B001LIK8M0,Toby J Martin,"[2, 3]","For the past few trips to Blockbuster Video, I've walked through the ""horror"" section and have seen the movie Amusement sitting on the shelf. It looks creepy...It has a scary clown on the cover, it's in the HORROR section, and the cover entices you with the line ""Your Fear. His Amusement"". The cover alone made me pick up the case a few times, and even after reading the summary on the back, the movie looks like it would be a thriller.Amusement is a horrible movie.The plot of the movie is quite simple, and should have worked out decently. You meet one of the three girls in the story; Tabitha (Katheryn Winnick), Shelby (Laura Breckenridge), and Lisa (Jessica Lewis), and you follow them for a short period of time, witnessing what we'll call ""the worst day of their life"". Each girl's story is presented separately, and then all tied together a little later in the film. The gist of the story is that when the three girls were in elementary school, there was a boy in their class who made a disturbing diorama of a gutted squirrel, and they decided to tell the teacher about it. The boy was committed to a mental hospital, and when he grew up, he decided that it was time for revenge on the girls who had him sent away.So great, you read the plot, and think ""Yeah, this has potential...the killer would have a good reason for revenge, I can see how separately the girls ""bad day"" stories tie into this big story..."". The first half of the movie is even pretty neat with some of the other gore that happens...but then we get to the half way point of the film. Everything starts to tie together in the movie, and it seems like there a lead-up to the ending starting to be formed, and then BAM! The movie comes to a dead stop. Once Tabitha realizes what's going on, it seems like the writers just said ""Well now what do we do"", and just slapped some lines together to finish out the movie. This is extremely poor form, and ruined what could have at least been a barely decent film.As something billed as a horror movie, especially a movie that's come out in the past few years I would have at least expected one of two things coming into the film that have become ""standards"" of horror: (semi) nudity or lots of gore. The ""violent"" scenes are extremely bland, and don't really show anything, and there's no eye candy either. Usually, from what I've seen, if a movie is known as a throw-away movie, there's usually at least something extremely gross to look at, or some semi-naked females here and there. This movie fails on both fronts, but in a film full of fail, I wouldn't have expected anything else from them.The ONLY redeeming part of the movie is the killer. The Laugh (that's right, The Laugh) does exactly what it sounds like...he laughs. The girls run into him, he does something serial killer-esque, and he just starts laughing in this creepy but hilarious laugh.",2,Abused not amused,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,2876,"['past', 'few', 'trips', 'Blockbuster', 'Video', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'horror', 'section', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Amusement', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'creepy', 'scary', 'clown', 'cover', 'HORROR', 'section', 'cover', 'line', 'Fear', 'Amusement', 'cover', 'alone', 'made', 'pick', 'up', 'case', 'few', 'times', 'even', 'reading', 'summary', 'back', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'thriller.Amusement', 'horrible', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'quite', 'simple', 'should', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'decently', 'meet', 'one', 'three', 'girls', 'story', 'Tabitha', 'Katheryn', 'Winnick', 'Shelby', 'Laura', 'Breckenridge', 'Lisa', 'Jessica', 'Lewis', 'follow', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'witnessing', 'what', ""'ll"", 'call', 'worst', 'day', 'life', 'girl', 'story', 'presented', 'separately', 'then', 'tied', 'together', 'little', 'later', 'film', 'gist', 'story', 'when', 'three', 'girls', 'were', 'elementary', 'school', 'was', 'boy', 'class', 'who', 'made', 'disturbing', 'diorama', 'gutted', 'squirrel', 'decided', 'tell', 'teacher', 'boy', 'was', 'committed', 'mental', 'hospital', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'revenge', 'girls', 'who', 'had', 'sent', 'away.So', 'great', 'read', 'plot', 'think', 'Yeah', 'potential', 'killer', 'would', 'have', 'good', 'reason', 'revenge', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'separately', 'girls', 'bad', 'day', 'stories', 'tie', 'big', 'story', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'even', 'pretty', 'neat', 'other', 'gore', 'then', 'get', 'half', 'way', 'point', 'film', 'Everything', 'tie', 'together', 'movie', 'lead-up', 'ending', 'starting', 'be', 'formed', 'then', 'BAM', 'movie', 'dead', 'stop', 'Once', 'Tabitha', 'what', 'going', 'writers', 'just', 'said', 'Well', 'now', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'just', 'slapped', 'lines', 'together', 'finish', 'out', 'movie', 'extremely', 'poor', 'form', 'ruined', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'barely', 'decent', 'film.As', 'something', 'billed', 'horror', 'movie', 'especially', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'expected', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'coming', 'film', 'have', 'become', 'standards', 'horror', 'semi', 'nudity', 'lots', 'gore', 'violent', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'bland', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'anything', 'eye', 'candy', 'Usually', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'known', 'throw-away', 'movie', 'usually', 'least', 'something', 'extremely', 'gross', 'look', 'semi-naked', 'females', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'fronts', 'film', 'full', 'fail', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'anything', 'else', 'them.The', 'ONLY', 'redeeming', 'part', 'movie', 'killer', 'Laugh', 'right', 'Laugh', 'exactly', 'what', 'girls', 'run', 'something', 'serial', 'killer-esque', 'just', 'laughing', 'creepy', 'hilarious', 'laugh']",Amusement
