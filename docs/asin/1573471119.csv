Ulibas ""Captain Couth""","[0, 0]",Huntress is a good movie but it could have been so much better if the filmmakers focused on the werewolf parts and have made it uncut instead of the heavily edited R-rating.  It's a good start.  Maybe they can remake this movie in the near future.  A good movie that could have been so much better and I wished it was.
