1130195,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00116GEJI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 5]","Edgar Allan PoeAfter being bombarded with previews for this film over the course of the past three months with whatever film I rented; the catchy Lennox song, the obscure language, and the idea of a dream within a dream all pulled within my mind so long, that ""Slipstream"" finally found its way into my queue - subsequently into my DVD player.  Bravo to the marketing, its constant barrage of previews finally did break through my subconscious and I had to watch this movie.  None the less, Sir Anthony Hopkins jumps headfirst into the role of tri-fecta by directing, producing, and also creating the music for this random film that demonstrates the power of editing coupled with free thought.  It is a simple story, but the way Hopkins narrates; he easily gives it a voice of his own as well as paying homage to several influential directors.  As his wife produces and acts in this film, ""Slipstream"" transforms before your eyes from a confusing dream to a project of passion.  As Hopkins gives you small puzzle piece after puzzle piece, the average viewer will immediately scrunch up their face, wonder where the explosions are, and not give this little gem an opportunity.  This is not mainstream cinema.  ""Slipstream"" forces the viewer to use your imagination, listen to the clues, watch the symbolism, and use every part of the brain possible.  As this being a film by Anthony Hopkins it was surprising, for this critic, it was even a bigger surprise -  ""Slipstream"" is a cranial film that kept me on the edge of my couch the entire one hour thirty minutes.We Have Lost the PlotWhere did this film come from?  Hopkins said that he had never written a film before, and I must say, this freshman outing hurt my brain more than any other film ever has.  It wasn't that it was boring, dull, overly stylish, or clich&eacute;, it was just intelligent.  There were scenes that just felt more surreal than - shall I say - real?  The concept that Hopkins developed, the idea of a dream within a dream, translated well to both being dream-like to even more literally, a film within a film.  He built an entire film around a small concept, a poem none-the-less, and he built it sans the big explosions, the linear storytelling, and the overpriced stars.  For the first time in my possible review existence, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed a particular scene involving Christian Slater and Jeffery Tambor.  Pre-""Slipstream"", one could never imagine the two being such a dynamic pair, but their words, their connection between themselves in that one scene was breathtaking.  I had to watch it again just to ensure that I understood their language.  It was as if Hopkins took a page from Tarantino's playbook with Oliver Stone looking on, that entire ""I'm Not a Crook"" coupled with the entire Yogi Bear references just sent shivers through my spine.  They were phenomenal, and I applaud Hopkins for giving them the words and emotion to create such a superb scene.This Stone-esque scene was just the beginning of something startling unique.  Hopkins creates these scenes further within the film, never quite giving us that full taste of the real plot, but just enough to keep us guessing.  This isn't ""Remains of the Day"" Hopkins or ""Silence of the Lambs"" Hopkins, this is a film utterly his own.  The average viewer will not understand his darkened message about life and existence, but those cinephiles that enjoy challenging films will fall over backwards.  Hopkins choice of editor also creates this world with fresh new brush-strokes.  At times the jumps are spooky spiced with some brooding foreshadowing, but Hopkins creates a story with the jumps, the editing is a part of the story - choosing to ignore them will inevitably mean that you are missing the destructive nature of the film.  ""Slipstream"" is a mystery; clues are heavily embedded in the language, characters, and choice of editing all created by Hopkins.  It reminded me of a bit of ""Primer"" coupled with ""Natural Born Killers"", but uniquely Hopkins.Overall, ""Slipstream"" came out of nowhere and proved to be an enjoyable hour and a half of unknown Hopkins.  Just when you think you know his style, he creates something like this.  The editing, the power of his actors (as small as they were), and his choice of language and sound blended a powerful film that will leave you guessing until the final moments - and even then, you may not capture the full scope of his message.  This is a challenging film to watch.  It isn't you straightforward storytelling or compelling characters, and in fact, Hopkins is only in about half the film.  It is the idea of using the tools around you to create a non-linear story based with a film of a film.  If that sentence doesn't hurt, than you may not be ready for this film.  That isn't to say Hopkins film doesn't have flaws - it isn't perfect - but it was intellectually powerful.  This is a thinking-person's film, Hopkins realizes it, but he doesn't talk down to the average viewer.  He creates scenes and emotions that literally come out of nowhere, leaving you in the dust asking for more.  Again, watch the Slater/Tambor scene to see what I am speaking about - surprisingly - it will knock your socks off!If this constitutes the new world of Anthony Hopkins, I cannot wait for his second outing.  ""Slipstream"" took me back to an era where challenging cinema didn't go straight to DVD release, but instead found its way into mainstream and finally gave us something to pay nearly $10 for.  If you are looking for explosions, scantily clad women, and product placement - go to any summer blockbuster - if you are hunting for something to ensure brain cells are not decaying - see ""Slipstream"", it impressed me from beginning to end!Christian Slater/Jeffery Tambor 2008!Grade: ****  out of *****",4,Sweet Dreams are made of these?,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,5801,"['Edgar',

I meant to get the other Slipstream movie, the one with Mark Hamill in it.  I guess I clicked the wrong box and this is what arrived.  Oh well, it's got Anthony Hopkins in it, probably gonna be good.  Not.  Afterward, I grabbed the packing sheet thinking to return it and realized the used copy I ordered cost $0.01.

Somehow, knowing nothing about the financing of this film, I think the same terms could be applied to it. Yes, one can ultimately make sense of it,  put it all together into a meaningful pattern, but, at least for me, by that time, I really only wanted the film to end and had no desire to see or hear any more of it or about it.

It's hard to explain, but it was a movie about making a movie. Well, and it was one of these artsy movies that were shot all out of chronological order. Plus the filming was in the style of what I would call ""playing with yourself.""  Little gaps and blips were present. Stops occurred here and there. Things changed color here and there. Parts of the film were in black and white. In my interpretation, most of this was just diddling around and had no bearing on the story. It was a film that only moviemakers could enjoy, and they might well get a kick out of it.Parts were rather good. One part had two thugs take over a cafe and hold the employees as captives in a somewhat riveting scene, and then we find out that this was just part of the film they were shooting and everyone takes a break. Then one of the actors dies and there's a big scramble to decide what to do with saving the shots which have already been taken. Then there's the dreams about the film which are hard to tell from the film itself. One amusing episode has the writer asleep by his laptop and several people on the laptop screen watching him and commenting. Okay, it was somewhat clever and amusing here and there, but I just didn't get much out of the whole thing. Finally my mind just gave up on trying to piece it all together. I could try to watch it several more times to get it all sorted out, but it just isn't that interesting.

Those who liked it may have read what it was about beforehand. Try watching it like most people, just seeing the trailer/commercial. You're led to believe Slipstream is more of a time travel movie where the person is sent into the past to change things they're afraid of, etc. (this definition of the word slipstream is stated by one of the characters talking to Anthony) but that never happens. So, with that introduction, and no information or sense of what his current life/reality is, you watch the movie trying to figure out which parts are past, present or possibly future. As it turns out, it's all ""present"" but you never really get that.I have a good sense of humor (I don't care for the ""Three Stooges"" type of humor, but today's type I enjoy) but I saw NOTHING humorous about this movie and didn't even realize it was supposed to be a comedy 'til after I'd seen it. I'm also not ""easily confused"" as a reviewer felt negative reviewers might be. When someone asks, for example, ""Do you know the time?"", it is generally understood to mean, ""Please tell me the time if you know it"" and the typical response may be, ""12:35"".

In this sense the sleeping process may work out either liberator device or alienation mechanism. And that's why Hopkins, smartly makes reference to this cult movie ""The invasion of the body snatchers"", which is  (at least to my mind) the most pyramidal science fiction picture ever made in the Fifties. That interesting portrait about alien organisms, that masked into pods are capable to reproduce with absolute fidelity a human being after he has slept.So these brief interludes of the suspended conscious or the pores of the infiniteness acquire life, being absolutely to distinguish in this ambivalence state what is reality and what `s unreal, will take over the mind of Felix leading to the last frontier of unexplored and even wasteland territories of our memory's labyrinths, carving once more in relief, the demons of the reason produce monsters.""Along the history of cinema, there have been other films that have remarked this process of sudden breakthrough of the reality and the fiction. Paul Wengerer started in 1913 with his anthological film ""The student of Prague"", in the middle twenties was Murnau with ""The last man""; during the thirties ""The blue angel"", during the forties ""Dead of night"" ; in the fifties ""The seven seal""; in the sixties ""Shock corridor"" and ""Seconds"" ; in the seventies ""Catch 22"" and ""Someone flew into the cuckoo's nest""  in the  in the eighties  ""The stunt man"", ""Brazil""  and ""Altered states"", while in the Nineties ""Zentropa,"" ""Twelve monkeys"" and ""Window to Paris.""So, this film is not an easy film to watch.

1130210,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00116GEJI,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[1, 3]","I LOVE STORIES ABOUT TIME TRAVEL!  The movie, ""FREQUENCY"" is amongst my favourites.  I also like watching Anthony Hopkins on the screen -- he brings a reality and believablity to every movie I have seen him in. OK -- I've seen him in only two other movies:""Hearts of Atlantis"", (where he played a ""remote-viewer"" on the run from the authorities), and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", wherein his often chillingly normally-acting Hannibal Lector, (aka ""Hannibal The Cannabal"", (canibble?), gave a terrifyinglyreal tinge to this fictitious killer.  (I remember seeing the same moments of seeming-normality when I watched Tom Snyder's interview with Charles Manson.  Manson would seem SO normal for a few minutes...then his eyes would light up like a demented Christmas Tree, suddenly come to evil life...and you again became afraid for Mr. Snyder's safety, despite all the precautions you knew had to be in place....)  Looking at pictures of Mr. (or actually, SIR!) Anthony Hopkins, I think he would be PERFECT, to play one of my own personal heros -- Pope John Paul II -- in his older years, if ever such a movie was made.  Sir Anthony is the consummate professional --and I was definitely prepared for a real treat in this movie, which he not only acted in, but wrote and produced. A movie about one of my favourite subjects -- time-travel.  Not only this, but it also starred some of my favourite performers: JOHN TURTORRO, (who's done a wonderful job on the TV show ""MONK"", playing the lead character's, Adrian Monk's (TONY SHALHOUB's) brother, Ambrose Monk, KEVIN McCARTHY -- whom I, and just about every other sci-fi movie fan remembers fondly from ""INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS"", (a role he delighfully replays in this movie (!) -- but, sadly, it is never made clear in this movie whether it is the character or the actor whom we see here!, and CHRISTOPHER LAWFORD, whose other films I sadly have not seen, (yet!)...but whose name evokes fond memories of seeing films in which his late father, Peter Lawford, appeared.I felt I was guaranteed a treat, and settled back to totally enjoy myself as I slipped the DVD disk of ""Slipstream"" into my DVD player.,,,,I must sadly report that I have rarely been SO disappointed in any movie.  This may indeed, be the brilliant production of a very brilliant mind -- but my -- quite honestly -- less brilliant mind had a hard time grasping it all, at least as it was presented.  The action is disjointed -- as the situations, er...slip between and amongst each other with no seeming continuity.  This is SUPPOSED to be a movie about an ageing screen-writer, (Hopkins), whose characters unexpectedly come to life before his eyes.  But the line between what, (and who), is real, and what, (and who), is an illusion, is never truly defined, or at least, easily defined -- at least as far as I could see.  Only from the period dress, (1940s) of some of the lady characters, do you know that they are, er... ""not native"" to the 21st century.  Whether they are real or illusions is left up to the viewer to decide.  But it's real difficult for at least THIS viewer to decide, when the scenes themselves do not follow each other logically, and in sequence.  If this was done purposely to make the viewer realize the complications of the main character to distinguinsh between reality and fantasy, the ploy failed completely -- at least for me.  In any movie-- or play, book, ballet, or any other media -- the distinction between fantasty and reality, (if there is such a difference in said artistic work), should be drawn, and explained so the audience can UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING.  For instance, if there was a ""1984""ish type sci-fi made, and the people under the goverment's thumb kept their sanity, yet agreed totally with the dictum that ""2 + 2 = 5"", with no qualms whatsoever, it HAS to be explained to the audience that the reason for this seeming dichotomy is because....the people themselves have decided to secretly count numbers, ""1, 2, 4, 5, 3"".  Without this information, the viewer is confused and left adrift.  The many scenes in ""SLIPSTREAM"" which attempt to portray a dream-like atmosphere, and the difficulty of the main character to distinguish between reality and fantasy, are, sadly, not only dreamlike-- but utterly, and totally confusing.  Where is this movie going?  One really never completely finds out.""SLIPSTREAM"" is a very noble effort, in that it piled reality and fantasy together, hoping to impress the viewer with the difficulty the main character has in distinguishing one from the other -- but a little more logical sequencing, in both writing and editingwould have been SO welcome!  Many episodes of the classic TV show, ""THE TWILIGHT ZONE"", dealt with the difficulty to differentiate between fantasy and reality, as well....BUT JUST ABOUT EVERY VIEWER COULD FOLLOW THE LOGICALLY-EVOLVING STORY-LINES OF THESE EPISODES.  Here, the story-line does NOT logically evolve.  It takes TIME for most people to realize the innuendos and subleties in this movie.  Most are murky, and even the clearer ones, (such as a vulture quite unexpectedly uttering, ""Have A Nice Day""), are quickly followed by even more of the confusing ""is it reality or is it fantasy?"" scenes which, as the scenes THEMSELVES do not follow in a logical sequence, vut seem to pile upon each other in a disjointed sequencing that makes just about no sense whatsoever, and thus make for an even more confused viewer.Even so, I'm looking forwared, (eagerly!), to Sir Anthony's next science-fiction, science-fact, or fantasy film.  ""SLIPSTREAM"" shows a brilliant mind at work -- it's just that people with just as much interest in fantasy and science fiction, but without quite as brilliant a mind as Sir Anthony, find it hard to follow a ""scatter-scene"" script, that seems, which is difficult for, I hazard to guess, most viewers to follow.  So, I here respectfully  suggest that Sir Anthony watch, (or re-watch), the original TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, the original episdoes of THE OUTER LIMITS, or even some of the episodes of Steven Speilberg's AMAZING STORIES.  Amd perhaps, as well, ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  Even the strangest stories should have to have a LOGICAL SEQUENCE to them, so that those not quite as brilliant, (and I DO mean brilliant!!!!!) as Sir Anthony can also follow them!To make a point in a movie, the audience has to UNDERSTAND what's happenng.  If the majority of viewers of this movie don't understand it, as I have not, the point is lost.  And that is a great pity.  Because, even though I couldn't entirely follow the story, the brilliance in the acting, and special effects, still leads me to strongly believe Sir Anthony was trying very hard to get SOME points of view over to the audience.  I for one am very, very eager to know what those points were.  Unfortunately, as I was not able to follow this disjointed film, I still don't know what they are.  And, please believe me when I say I continue to want, very very much want, to know what they were and are. I'll be eagerly awaiting the next movie, to find out!  : )",2,D R O W N I N G.......I N.......T H E.......S L I P S T R E A M,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,7077,"['LOVE', 'STORIES', 'ABOUT', 'TIME',

It starts out feeling like a 'Hollywood behind-the-scenes' movie, but then appears to change into a gangland murder mystery.  Shortly thereafter, you see the 'horse-of-a-different-color' from the WIZARD OF OZ, except that the 'horse' has been updated to a late model Corvette, and this modern horse-of-a-different-color scene ends with a silent-film-era closing iris shot.  The movie then turns into a 20-minute updated version of the 1936 Bette Davis/Humphrey Bogart movie THE PETRIFIED FOREST (except that Christian Slater is an even more menacing screen presence than Bogart was).  The film then transforms into a Hollywood behind-the-scenes farce, before morphing in other ways.Near the end there is a 3-minute laugh-out-loud cartoonish sequence in the screen writer's study, and during the five minutes of closing credits the entire movie runs backwards in fast motion (as if an old reel-to-reel projector were projecting the film as it was being rewound).  There are repeated references to the original 1956 INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and the nearly 90-year-old star of that movie (Kevin McCarthy) plays himself in a charming bit part. In the DVD Special Features commentary, Anthony Hopkins explains the significance of the references to the INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, but he leaves many other things for the viewers to enjoy discovering for themselves (such as the fleeting three or four frames of a redddish-orange Frisbee flying through the desert like a UFO on its way to Area 51).",5,Challenging but richly rewarding celebration of cinema,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,1660,"['baffling', 'first', 'once', 'understand', 'spirit', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'romp', 'celebration', 'movies', 'art', 'form', 'out', 'feeling', 'behind-the-scenes', 'movie', 'then', 'change', 'gangland', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'see', ""'horse-of-a-different-color"", 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', ""'horse"", 'been', 'updated', 'late', 'model', 'Corvette', 'modern', 'horse-of-a-different-color', 'scene', 'silent-film-era', 'closing', 'iris', 'shot', 'movie', 'then', '20-minute', 'updated', 'version', '1936', 'Bette', 'Davis/Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'movie', 'THE', 'PETRIFIED', 'FOREST', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'even', 'more', 'menacing', 'screen', 'presence', 'Bogart', 'was', 'film', 'then', 'Hollywood', 'behind-the-scenes', 'farce', 'morphing', 'other', 'end', '3-minute', 'laugh-out-loud', 'cartoonish', 'sequence', 'screen', 'writer', 'study', 'five', 'minutes', 'closing', 'credits', 'entire', 'movie', 'backwards', 'fast', 'motion', 'old', 'reel-to-reel', 'projector', 'were', 'projecting', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'rewound', 'are', 'repeated', 'references', 'original', '1956', 'INVASION', 'THE', 'BODY', 'SNATCHERS', 'nearly', '90-year-old', 'star', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'McCarthy', 'charming', 'bit', 'part', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'commentary', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'significance', 'references', 'INVASION', 'THE', 'BODY', 'SNATCHERS', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'viewers', 'enjoy', 'discovering', 'such', 'fleeting', 'three', 'four', 'frames', 'redddish-orange', 'Frisbee', 'flying', 'desert', 'UFO', 'way', 'Area', '51']",Slipstream

1130213,AA2F2KW85SEE1,B00116GEJI,Robert B,"[4, 5]","...which takes place in the final minutes (or seconds) of a screenwriter's life. This amazing movie documents in stream-of-conciousness manner the merging of a movie script written by one 'Felix Bonhoeffer' (see below why I put quotes) and the reality of an indeterminate period of the writer's life, maybe most of his life. People and places are interchangeable, as are times...it's the final flash of a confused, dying person, just the way we're told that our life flashes before us in our last moments.A recurring theme throughout the film is the 1950s horror movie, 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', an allegorical film which has had many interpretations; the frightening thing about that film was that you would lose your identity, your mind, and your life to creatures that occupy your physical body after you fall asleep. And we all must sleep, sooner or later. The star of the original film, Kevin McCarthy appears in this film, interacting with Felix from time to time.An amusing in-joke about the director of the film-within-a-film, Gavin, who has a tyrannical film producer for a brother is that the actor who plays Gavin is Gavin Glazer, who happens to have a famous successful producer for a brother, one Brian Glazer. You don't get to be successful in Hollywood by being a sweetheart, no matter what they say to each other at the Academy Awards.Another interesting point is that Felix Bonhoeffer is probably not his real name - check the book cover on the table in a later scene - if his last name is Bonhoeffer, then his first name's not Felix, or if his first name IS Felix, then he's just lifted the Bonhoeffer name from the book, whose author has a different first name, or maybe he did write the book, or maybe he didn't; maybe he just bought it. ADDENDUM: the Bonhoeffer name is inspired by Dieter Bonhoeffer, who was a German Luther pastor, and an opponent of the Hitler regime. He was hanged in 1945 due to his involvement in an asassination attempt by the Abwehr in 1943. (And I thought I knew my history trivia...). This explains the periodic flashes of images of Hitler.This movie is masterfully edited and takes you from one surprise to the next in such a way that it needs to be viewed more than once to absorb it all; it's an incredibly complex script. An interview with Hopkins, (who wrote the script and the incidental music) in the special features section makes it clear that this was a personal project, not expected to have great commercial success, and in this, he was correct. According to Box Office Mojo, the worldwide gross for this film was about 27,000 dollars, which must be some kind of record. I hope DVD sales make more - this deserves to be a genuine cult film, and I think it's probably one of the best movies I have seen for many years.Just the fact that there are wildly different opinions of this movie should provoke the curiosity of those who seek unconventional movie entertainment!",5,Joycean stream of conciousness...,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2935,"['place', 'final', 'minutes', 'screenwriter', 'life', 'amazing', 'movie', 'documents', 'stream-of-conciousness', 'manner', 'merging', 'movie', 'script', 'written', 'one', ""'Felix"", 'Bonhoeffer', 'see', 'why', 'put', 'quotes', 'reality', 'indeterminate', 'period', 'writer', 'life', 'maybe', 'most', 'life', 'People', 'places', 'are', 'interchangeable', 'are', 'times', 'final', 'flash', 'confused', 'dying', 'person', 'just', 'way', ""'re"", 'told', 'life', 'flashes', 'last', 'moments.A', 'recurring', 'theme', 'film', '1950s', 'horror', 'movie', ""'Invasion"", 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'allegorical', 'film', 'had', 'many', 'interpretations', 'frightening', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'would', 'lose', 'identity', 'mind', 'life', 'creatures', 'occupy', 'physical', 'body', 'fall', 'asleep', 'must', 'sleep', 'sooner', 'later', 'star', 'original', 'film', 'Kevin', 'McCarthy', 'film', 'interacting', 'Felix', 'time', 'time.An', 'amusing', 'in-joke', 'director', 'film-within-a-film', 'Gavin', 'who', 'tyrannical', 'film', 'producer', 'brother', 'actor', 'who', 'Gavin', 'Gavin', 'Glazer', 'who', 'have', 'famous', 'successful', 'producer', 'brother', 'one', 'Brian', 'Glazer', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'be', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'being', 'sweetheart', 'matter', 'what', 'say', 'other', 'Academy', 'Awards.Another', 'interesting', 'point', 'Felix', 'Bonhoeffer', 'probably', 'not', 'real', 'name', 'check', 'book', 'cover', 'table', 'later', 'scene', 'last', 'name', 'Bonhoeffer', 'then', 'first', 'name', 'not', 'Felix', 'first', 'name', 'IS', 'Felix', 'then', 'just', 'lifted', 'Bonhoeffer', 'name', 'book', 'author', 'different', 'first', 'name', 'maybe', 'did', 'write', 'book', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'maybe', 'just', 'bought', 'Bonhoeffer', 'name', 'inspired', 'Dieter', 'Bonhoeffer', 'who', 'was', 'German', 'Luther', 'pastor', 'opponent', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'was', 'hanged', '1945', 'due', 'involvement', 'asassination', 'attempt', 'Abwehr', '1943', 'thought', 'knew', 'history', 'trivia', 'periodic', 'flashes', 'images', 'Hitler.This', 'movie', 'masterfully', 'edited', 'one', 'surprise', 'next', 'such', 'way', 'be', 'viewed', 'more', 'once', 'absorb', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'script', 'interview', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'incidental', 'music', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'clear', 'was', 'personal', 'project', 'not', 'expected', 'have', 'great', 'commercial', 'success', 'was', 'correct', 'According', 'Box', 'Office', 'Mojo', 'worldwide', 'gross', 'film', 'was', '27,000', 'dollars', 'must', 'be', 'kind', 'record', 'hope', 'DVD', 'sales', 'make', 'more', 'be', 'genuine', 'cult', 'film', 'think', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'years.Just', 'fact', 'are', 'wildly', 'different', 'opinions', 'movie', 'should', 'provoke', 'curiosity', 'who', 'seek', 'unconventional', 'movie', 'entertainment']",Slipstream

1130215,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B00116GEJI,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[0, 1]","""Slipstream"" is a movie written by, directed by and acted in by Anthony Hopkins.  It should be great.  It is a stinker.  Nowadays it has become popular to make surreal movies that leave the viewer guessing.  It is overdone, in general, and especially overdone in this movie.  There is a constant barrage of disconnected shots and sounds, leading more to confusion and boredom than to profound experience.I'm still not sure what this movie was supposed to be out and was surprised when one commentator wrote that it is supposed to be a commedy [???].  If so, it's the most uncomedic comedy ever.  The only thing I can figure about this mishmash is that it reflects the writer's [Hopkins] own confusion in making a confusing movie.  It might be like an old ""Twight Zone"" film that was altogether better done.  In the Twilight film characters at a diner are confused when they do illogical things, make stupid statements and then have to repeat them again.  It turns out that they aren't real.  They are the product of an overwrought author's imagination as he types pages of dialogue and action, only to toss them in artistic disgust and start over again.Maybe that's the point of this movie but, if it's the point, it's seen through a very dark looking glass.  Maybe Hopkins the writer is writing and rewriting his script and his 'actors', not knowing they are puppets on the writer's string, go through oftentimes idiotic actions only to have to repeat them again, better.  Maybe but I'm not sure.

It is shattered and shattering, disconnected yet completely and intricately connected, a dream within a dream (to quote Poe) and the nightmare that stays with us when we're awake, hiding just behind our eyes and making us see things that aren't there, or maybe that are. If you find these ideas difficult to fathom, be proud of your sanity and hold on to it with both fists. Those of us who are mad will understand every frame.As a writer myself, I relate particularly to the sensation of pentimento that Hopkins' character experiences as his creations -- his characters -- take on a certain aspect of reality that is all their own. We create them; we are indeed their creator. However, as their creator, we are responsible for them. It's a lifetime commitment, and if you forget them... I promise you, they will come back and complain about their treatment at your supernatural hand.Start with &#34;All That Jazz,&#34; the brilliant Bob Fosse film -- it will ease you into the world of the creative genius whose mind recreates his reality through dream sequences and an intimate conversation with Death.
