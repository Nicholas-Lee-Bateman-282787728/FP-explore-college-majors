It is almost as if the British have done a total reverse of their post ww2 view that the British felt that they were the smart ones in the relationship. It cast doubts as to whether there is a special relationship between Britain and the US, and it also contains the view that Tony Blair was not a progressive which the films sees as a criticism of him.The filming itself was good. There were times, I was stunned how seamlessly, the movie was able to merge the movie into historical films.

He's played him twice before (inThe Dealand, of course,The Queen [Blu-ray]), and now returns to the role that's made him famous playing opposite Dennis Quaid as Bill Clinton. That he's played the role in three different films speaks volumes to how good he is in it, though I'm sure he's looking forward to not doing it anymore.This particular movie tells the story of the relationship between Blair and Clinton, with a particular focus on the events surrounding NATO's intervention in Kosovo and the Lewinski scandal. As such it's got a very different style than ""The Queen"", and isn't quite as good, but is very entertaining.I particularly liked Sheen's performance, again. Helen McRory does an excellent job as Ms Blair. Dennis Quaid... Dennis Quaid acts quite like Clinton, but looks nothing like him. In fact in several scenes he looks quite a bit like Al Gore, which is a little startling at times.But beyond that rather odd bit of casting the movie works and works well. You get a real insight into the way the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK works (and you certainly come away knowing who the junior partner is). At no point was I bored and if it's note quite as excellent as ""The Queen"" that's mostly due to a somewhat drier plot.

1354645,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003N9ASF2,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP ~ This nearly made my eyeballs fall out when I saw Michael Sheen was reprising his portrayal of former Prime Minister Tony Blair--for the third time now--and I flew off my seat when I saw Dennis Quaid was playing President Bill Clinton. This movie does not disappoint.Naturally, ""the special relationship"" can be traced back to King George VI (the queen's father), who developed what he called ""a special relationship"" with FDR and the U.S. While the film misleads a bit about that - the idea that all countries want a special relationship with the U.S., how arrogant can we get - it certainly describes the very spine of the narrative here.Though THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP is not as rich and well-planned-out as Stephen Frears'The Queen(with Michael Sheen in his second role reprisal as Blair) it is fascinating to watch the great friendship between Blair and the Clintons. It's fun to see the Clintons and the Blairs privately talking about each other, and a profound sadness at seeing their friendship meltdown.Quaid hands in an Oscar-worthy one here. Clinton is the next Nixon as we all know, and no actor has taken a shot at Clinton. Quaid has set a standard, and I hope everyone gets to see this. He could so easily have caricatured the president in an ugly way, he could have ruined the voice...in short, it's the actor's old ""Nixon Trap"".Quaid nails the voice and ensures that nothing goes awry with his portrayal. I'd like to direct fans to the spectacularFrost/Nixon(see my review) with Sheen starring as David Frost and a spooky Frank Langella giving his tour-de-force performance as Nixon.Sheen deserves an Oscar as well. While he was a sort of sitting duck who transformed himself into a swan in THE QUEEN, here is quite powerful, confident and rather tough on Clinton late in their friendship. He matches Quaid's genius move for move.Also pleasing to see was the return of Michael Sheen's partners-in-crime, Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair and the annoying Mark Bazeley as Alastair Campbell. (Gosh, is this Campbell like that in real life? No wonder Blair has aged badly.)Though the film looks too hard toward THE QUEEN andThe Deal(the tv film in which Sheen first played Blair), both Frears-directed films and both fascinating, thus causing it to fall a bit short, it is riveting nevertheless. The crises facing Clinton and the triumphs facing Blair cannot be missed.This movie makes it look like Clinton taught Blair everything. The concentration on Blair's achievements vis-a-vis Bosnia as well as Northern Ireland is superb. While Clinton assisted Blair through the horribly bloody waters of Ireland's problems, Blair later looked to Clinton for help with Milosevic in Bosnia--help which Clinton was unwilling to give.Thus begins the downward spiral in Blair-Clinton relations, because Clinton begins to doubt Blair was ever really a left-centrist progressive. Meanwhile Blair practically kills himself defending Clinton morally. It is sad for Americans to see who the better man really is, and it isn't Clinton. Had he not turned a friendship into an endless pissing contest, insulting and accusing Blair at every turn, history might be very different.Clinton's endless jealous rants about Blair's legacy was a most astonishing and little-known fact. It is, I guess, to Clinton's credit that he didn't publicly air this laundry. Blair, whatever his apparent shortcomings, is shown through and through as a great man, which he is.Andre Desplat comes back with some THE QUEEN-tinged soundtrack but he really holds back. Some of it literally sounds rinky-dink and anemic. I wonder why they would allow Desplat to get away with this kind of thing. The performances and terrific humor in this film make up for the little soundtrack.I was startled by the end of this film, in which we see the real press conference held by Blair and George W. Bush at Camp David. Why not do it with actors?--and it struck me, this is brilliant, really not done often or done well. It's leading us, as it were, back into 'real' reality. And what a snappy bite, seeing the real moron who would step in to lead this nation, with Blair standing next to him in a state of semi-shocked disbelief. No wonder they went with the real deal and not actors.Get this, enjoy it and make sure Mr. Blair (and Michael Sheen in the bargain) does not lose his well-earned place in our history.",5,The special film that tells the story,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,4392,"['SPECIAL', 'RELATIONSHIP', '~', 'nearly', 'made', 'eyeballs', 'fall', 'out', 'when', 'saw', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'was', 'reprising', 'portrayal', 'former', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'third', 'time', 'now', 'flew', 'seat', 'when', 'saw', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'was', 'playing', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'movie', 'not', 'disappoint.Naturally', 'special', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'queen', 'father', 'who', 'developed', 'what', 'called', 'special', 'relationship', 'FDR', 'U.S', 'film', 'bit', 'idea', 'countries', 'want', 'special', 'relationship', 'U.S.', 'how', 'arrogant', 'can', 'get', 'certainly', 'very', 'spine', 'narrative', 'here.Though', 'THE', 'SPECIAL', 'RELATIONSHIP', 'not', 'rich', 'well-planned-out', 'Stephen', ""Frears'The"", 'Queen', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'second', 'role', 'reprisal', 'Blair', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'great', 'friendship', 'Blair', 'Clintons', 'fun', 'see', 'Clintons', 'Blairs', 'privately', 'talking', 'other', 'profound', 'sadness', 'seeing', 'friendship', 'meltdown.Quaid', 'hands', 'Oscar-worthy', 'one', 'here', 'Clinton', 'next', 'Nixon', 'know', 'actor', 'taken', 'shot', 'Clinton', 'Quaid', 'set', 'standard', 'hope', 'everyone', 'see', 'could', 'so', 'easily', 'have', 'caricatured', 'president', 'ugly', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'ruined', 'voice', 'short', 'actor', 'old', 'Nixon', 'Trap', '.Quaid', 'voice', 'nothing', 'awry', 'portrayal', ""'d"", 'like', 'direct', 'fans', 'spectacularFrost/Nixon', 'see', 'review', 'Sheen', 'starring', 'David', 'Frost', 'spooky', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'giving', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Nixon.Sheen', 'Oscar', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'sort', 'sitting', 'duck', 'who', 'transformed', 'swan', 'THE', 'QUEEN', 'here', 'quite', 'powerful', 'confident', 'rather', 'tough', 'Clinton', 'late', 'friendship', 'Quaid', 'genius', 'move', 'move.Also', 'pleasing', 'see', 'was', 'return', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'partners-in-crime', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'annoying', 'Mark', 'Bazeley', 'Alastair', 'Campbell', 'Gosh', 'Campbell', 'real', 'life', 'wonder', 'Blair', 'aged', 'badly', 'film', 'too', 'hard', 'THE', 'QUEEN', 'andThe', 'Deal', 'tv', 'film', 'Sheen', 'first', 'played', 'Blair', 'Frears-directed', 'films', 'fascinating', 'thus', 'causing', 'fall', 'bit', 'short', 'riveting', 'nevertheless', 'crises', 'facing', 'Clinton', 'triumphs', 'facing', 'Blair', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed.This', 'movie', 'look', 'Clinton', 'taught', 'Blair', 'everything', 'concentration', 'Blair', 'achievements', 'vis-a-vis', 'Bosnia', 'as', 'well', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'superb', 'Clinton', 'assisted', 'Blair', 'horribly', 'bloody', 'waters', 'Ireland', 'problems', 'Blair', 'later', 'looked', 'Clinton', 'help', 'Milosevic', 'Bosnia', 'help', 'Clinton', 'was', 'unwilling', 'give.Thus', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Blair-Clinton', 'relations', 'Clinton', 'doubt', 'Blair', 'was', 'ever', 'really', 'left-centrist', 'progressive', 'Meanwhile', 'Blair', 'practically', 'defending', 'Clinton', 'morally', 'sad', 'Americans', 'see', 'who', 'better', 'man', 'really', ""n't"", 'Clinton', 'Had', 'not', 'turned', 'friendship', 'endless', 'pissing', 'contest', 'insulting', 'accusing', 'Blair', 'turn', 'history', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'different.Clinton', 'endless', 'jealous', 'rants', 'Blair', 'legacy', 'was', 'most', 'astonishing', 'little-known', 'fact', 'guess', 'Clinton', 'credit', 'did', ""n't"", 'publicly', 'air', 'laundry', 'Blair', 'apparent', 'shortcomings', 'shown', 'great', 'man', 'Desplat', 'back', 'THE', 'QUEEN-tinged', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'back', 'literally', 'rinky-dink', 'anemic', 'wonder', 'why', 'would', 'allow', 'Desplat', 'get', 'away', 'kind', 'thing', 'performances', 'terrific', 'humor', 'film', 'make', 'up', 'little', 'soundtrack.I', 'was', 'startled', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'real', 'press', 'conference', 'held', 'Blair', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Camp', 'David', 'Why', 'not', 'do', 'actors', 'struck', 'brilliant', 'really', 'not', 'done', 'often', 'done', 'well', 'leading', 'were', 'back', ""'real"", 'reality', 'what', 'snappy', 'bite', 'seeing', 'real', 'moron', 'who', 'would', 'step', 'lead', 'nation', 'Blair', 'standing', 'next', 'state', 'semi-shocked', 'disbelief', 'wonder', 'went', 'real', 'deal', 'not', 'actors.Get', 'enjoy', 'make', 'sure', 'Mr.', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'bargain', 'not', 'lose', 'well-earned', 'place', 'history']",The Special Relationship
1354646,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B003N9ASF2,F. S. L'hoir,"[1, 1]","Let me begin by saying that I enjoyed this BBC-HBO production immensely, largely because of Martin Sheen's nuanced portrayal of Tony Blair. I have to acknowledge, however, that viewer reactions might be based upon how one feels about both Blair and Clinton.  Some might find the film either too pro- or too con, because of the writers' and director's determination to keep the scenario firmly anchored in the middle of the political road, allowing the viewer to make up his mind on whether Blair began his political career as a novice, learned the political tricks of the trade (no pun intended) from a master conjurer, and then surpassed his mentor in dealing squarely with political reality.The director is particularly neutral in his attitude toward the present Secretary of State, well acted by Hope Davis, while he allows (constantly munching) Dennis Quaid as her  philandering husband to suggest a cringing leer, when she questions him about the truth of the scandal; and Helen McCrory's Cherie, suggests, not-quite subtly, a crypto-Lady MacBeth in waiting. Not really over-the-top performances, but almost!Michael Sheen's often-underplayed portrayal of Blair, however, keeps the film on track. He shows us a combination of vulnerable charm that soon emerges as infectious charisma, that the original does possess, whether one approves of him politically or not. Watching Sheen's portrayal, I found myself, at first, constantly readjusting my perspective, telling myself: ""no, Sheen doesn't look like Blair."" Soon, however, I forgot about my initial scepticism, accepting him without reserve as Tony Blair.I therefore wish that the cinematographer had photo-shopped Sheen in the final newsreel scenes, because the sight of the real Blair brought me back to reality, but perhaps a sudden dose of reality is exactly what the director had in mind.",5,A Special Relationship Revisited,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,1850,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'enjoyed', 'BBC-HBO', 'production', 'immensely', 'largely', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'have', 'acknowledge', 'however', 'viewer', 'reactions', 'might', 'be', 'based', 'how', 'one', 'Blair', 'Clinton', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'either', 'too', 'pro-', 'too', 'con', 'writers', 'director', 'determination', 'keep', 'scenario', 'firmly', 'anchored', 'middle', 'political', 'road', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'Blair', 'began', 'political', 'career', 'novice', 'learned', 'political', 'tricks', 'trade', 'pun', 'intended', 'master', 'conjurer', 'then', 'surpassed', 'mentor', 'dealing', 'squarely', 'political', 'reality.The', 'director', 'particularly', 'neutral', 'attitude', 'present', 'Secretary', 'State', 'well', 'acted', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'constantly', 'munching', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'philandering', 'husband', 'suggest', 'cringing', 'leer', 'when', 'questions', 'truth', 'scandal', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'Cherie', 'not-quite', 'subtly', 'crypto-Lady', 'MacBeth', 'waiting', 'Not', 'really', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'almost', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'often-underplayed', 'portrayal', 'Blair', 'however', 'film', 'track', 'combination', 'vulnerable', 'charm', 'soon', 'infectious', 'charisma', 'original', 'possess', 'one', 'approves', 'politically', 'not', 'Watching', 'Sheen', 'portrayal', 'found', 'first', 'constantly', 'readjusting', 'perspective', 'telling', 'Sheen', ""n't"", 'look', 'Blair', 'Soon', 'however', 'forgot', 'initial', 'scepticism', 'accepting', 'reserve', 'Tony', 'Blair.I', 'therefore', 'wish', 'cinematographer', 'had', 'photo-shopped', 'Sheen', 'final', 'newsreel', 'scenes', 'sight', 'real', 'Blair', 'brought', 'back', 'reality', 'perhaps', 'sudden', 'dose', 'reality', 'exactly', 'what', 'director', 'had', 'mind']",The Special Relationship

Indeed, there are many moments in his portrayal of the former British Prime Minister when you forget that you are not watching the real man.THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, from HBO Home Entertainment, marks the third time that Sheen has played Blair on screen.  Since the plot centers on him, rather than, for example, Queen Elizabeth, his portrayal in this film is much more comprehensive than his earlier efforts.Set against world events, Peter Morgan's script is, in essence, a story about a ""student"" learning from and then surpassing his ""teacher"".The ""teacher"" in this case is President Bill Clinton (Dennis Quaid in a remarkable performance).Clinton was nearing the end of his first term as President when Blair became Prime Minister.  There was an immediate rapport between the two men and, both being liberals, they pledged to make their ""special relationship"" work and together bring the free world to their political way of thinking.  Blair stood by Clinton when the President's embarrassing sexual affairs nearly brought down his Presidency, but the two friends butted heads over the war in Bosnia.Directed by Richard Loncraine, this fine film examines the nature of friendship in the world of politics.

This is a tight if not thin script on the relationship between Blair and Clinton ending with Blair's choice to stand by Bush. It portrays Clinton in quite a good light as a flawed yet steadfast man who despite infidelity had a strong marriage. Blair is portrayed as a lot cleaner than Clinton but in the end he's shown to be the slithering reptile all Brits understand him to be. Its not a grand film but I did like it, especially the ending which really sums up the films point of view which is that Blair stood for anything that would bring him personal glory. In short he has no fixed political agenda save which way the wind is blowing. I give it four cocks up, two for the men portrayed and two for their wives.",4,A pleasant surprise,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,788,"['was', 'prepared', 'be', 'bored', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'tight', 'not', 'thin', 'script', 'relationship', 'Blair', 'Clinton', 'ending', 'Blair', 'choice', 'stand', 'Bush', 'Clinton', 'quite', 'good', 'light', 'flawed', 'yet', 'steadfast', 'man', 'who', 'infidelity', 'had', 'strong', 'marriage', 'Blair', 'portrayed', 'lot', 'cleaner', 'Clinton', 'end', 'shown', 'be', 'slithering', 'reptile', 'Brits', 'understand', 'be', 'not', 'grand', 'film', 'did', 'especially', 'ending', 'really', 'up', 'films', 'point', 'view', 'Blair', 'stood', 'anything', 'would', 'bring', 'personal', 'glory', 'short', 'fixed', 'political', 'agenda', 'save', 'way', 'wind', 'blowing', 'give', 'four', 'up', 'two', 'men', 'portrayed', 'two', 'wives']",The Special Relationship

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 2]","How you feel about this HBO Original Film - which garnered FIVE Emmy Nominations will definitely depend on your political beliefs and how you felt about President Bill Clinton and his ""personal"" problems while in office. There's no denying that. The film doesn't really take sides but there is a bit of a slant to it.Actually the film - a co production with the BBC - is just as much about British Prime Minister Tony Blair and is the third in a trilogy about him, all starring Michael Sheen as Blair. He looks a lot like him too. Clinton is played by Dennis Quaid and looks very little like him. And his drawl is almost a caricature. It takes a long while to not be distracted by this Saturday Night Live- type imitation. And this was the most disappointing part of the film for me. Hope Davis as Hilary Clinton, however is spot-on! She looks like her and captures her body language and speech patterns even better than Tina Fey channels Sarah Palin. If the ever make The Hilary Clinton Story, Davis needs to fill the title role!The period covered in the film is just 5 years and its recent history to us. Maybe over time the Clinton impression will seem less off-putting. And the use by Director Richard Loncraine of real footage near the end of the film makes the role seem even more miscast.There is only ONE bonus feature: A less-than five minute ""making of"" featurette that adds nothing of value to the film.One of three recent Emmy Nominated HBO films to see light on DVD this fall (the others were the five star films  You Don't Know Jack and Temple Grandin), this one is unfortunately not up to the usual HBO standards, in my opinion.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Great caricatures of Tony Blair and Hilary Clinton but Quaid is no Bill Clinton.,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,1676,"['How', 'feel', 'HBO', 'Original', 'Film', 'garnered', 'FIVE', 'Emmy', 'Nominations', 'will', 'definitely', 'depend', 'political', 'beliefs', 'how', 'felt', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'personal', 'problems', 'office', 'denying', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'sides', 'bit', 'slant', 'it.Actually', 'film', 'co', 'production', 'BBC', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'third', 'trilogy', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Blair', 'lot', 'too', 'Clinton', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'very', 'little', 'drawl', 'almost', 'caricature', 'long', 'while', 'not', 'be', 'distracted', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live-', 'type', 'imitation', 'was', 'most', 'disappointing', 'part', 'film', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Hilary', 'Clinton', 'however', 'spot-on', 'body', 'language', 'speech', 'patterns', 'even', 'better', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'channels', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'ever', 'make', 'Hilary', 'Clinton', 'Story', 'Davis', 'fill', 'title', 'role', 'period', 'covered', 'film', 'just', '5', 'years', 'recent', 'history', 'Maybe', 'time', 'Clinton', 'impression', 'will', 'seem', 'less', 'off-putting', 'use', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Loncraine', 'real', 'footage', 'end', 'film', 'role', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'miscast.There', 'only', 'ONE', 'bonus', 'feature', 'less-than', 'five', 'minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'nothing', 'value', 'film.One', 'three', 'recent', 'Emmy', 'Nominated', 'HBO', 'films', 'see', 'light', 'DVD', 'fall', 'others', 'were', 'five', 'star', 'films', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Jack', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'usual', 'HBO', 'standards', 'opinion.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Special Relationship

The film has a great cast. Dennis Quaid really becomes Bill Clinton and not a caricature on Saturday Night Live. Hope Davis does a very good job in capturing Hillary Rodham Clinton's character. It's really Michael Sheen's performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair and Helen McCrory's performance as his wife. They played the same roles in the film, ""The Queen."" Anyway, this film might be useful in the schools regarding international politics but the Lewinsky scandal and vulgar descriptions make it hard to pass the censor.Regardless, I didn't find the story that intriguing except that Blair comes across as idealing Clinton as some hero.

Hope Davis owns Hillary Clinton. She did a better job portraying her than perhaps Tina Fey does Palin. Quaid had down Clinton's speech but he simply didn't look like him. The movie starts with an obscure Blair studying the US 1992 campaign to see how the Democrats turned things around. (It is easier for a political party to change its views than it is to change the views of the people.)Cherie Blair is envious of Hillary because Bill shares his power with her as she is his closest adviser. The movie then moves to Ireland then goes through the Monica scandal and climaxes with Blair becoming the master politician over Bosnia-Kosovo genocide. Ominous music is played when Bush is elected (hint at liberal bias). I found the movie to be extremely interesting and more entertaining than I expected. What the movie doesn't show is how Blair got dismantled over his special relationship with Bush and the Iraqi war, although Clinton's final words were that of a warning to Blair NOT to get close to Bush and questions if Blair is a true progressive.There is some sex talk over the Monica affair and Hillary does drop the f-bomb once.",4,HOPE CLINTON,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,1266,"['movie', 'centers', 'primarily', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'how', 'political', 'genius', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'helped', 'along', 'student', 'became', 'master', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'perhaps', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Palin', 'Quaid', 'had', 'down', 'Clinton', 'speech', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'movie', 'obscure', 'Blair', 'studying', 'US', '1992', 'campaign', 'see', 'how', 'Democrats', 'turned', 'things', 'easier', 'political', 'party', 'change', 'views', 'change', 'views', 'people', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'envious', 'Hillary', 'Bill', 'shares', 'power', 'closest', 'adviser', 'movie', 'then', 'Ireland', 'then', 'Monica', 'scandal', 'climaxes', 'Blair', 'becoming', 'master', 'politician', 'Bosnia-Kosovo', 'genocide', 'Ominous', 'music', 'played', 'when', 'Bush', 'elected', 'hint', 'liberal', 'bias', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'more', 'entertaining', 'expected', 'What', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'how', 'Blair', 'got', 'dismantled', 'special', 'relationship', 'Bush', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'Clinton', 'final', 'words', 'were', 'warning', 'Blair', 'NOT', 'get', 'close', 'Bush', 'questions', 'Blair', 'true', 'progressive.There', 'sex', 'talk', 'Monica', 'affair', 'Hillary', 'drop', 'f-bomb', 'once']",The Special Relationship
