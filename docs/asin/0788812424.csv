Jesse Harper's Dad was a star here, back when the Angels really played football. By the time son Jesse is old enough to play, they have sunk to the bottom of the league.  Dad dies in a tragic accident on the way home to celebrate Jesse making the team.  Jesse blames himself, has quit the team, and is sliding down a precarious moral slope.  His younger brother Kevin (David Gallagher) is the ""true believer"" and the real star of the show. He prays for Divine Intercession and receives it.  The finale is, predicably enough, a game pitting the Westfield Angels against the Screaming Demons.The Announcer up in the booth at the games is well worth the price of admission.  The funniest line is delivered by Westfield's coach to the European exchange student/soccer player/kicker, who is so happy to have made the team, that he ecstatically kisses the coach.  In a paraphrase of Tom Hanks' great line in A League of Their Own: ""There is no kissing in football!""",3,Another Feel Good Disney Sports Flick,1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,1133,"['follow-up', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'time', 'angels', 'led', 'quirky', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Taxi', 'Back', 'Future', 's', 'are', 'assisting', 'Westfiled', 'High', 'School', 'Angels', 'Jesse', 'Harper', 'Dad', 'was', 'star', 'here', 'back', 'when', 'Angels', 'really', 'played', 'football', 'time', 'son', 'Jesse', 'old', 'enough', 'play', 'have', 'sunk', 'bottom', 'league', 'Dad', 'tragic', 'accident', 'way', 'home', 'celebrate', 'Jesse', 'making', 'team', 'Jesse', 'quit', 'team', 'sliding', 'down', 'precarious', 'moral', 'slope', 'younger', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'David', 'Gallagher', 'true', 'believer', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'Divine', 'Intercession', 'finale', 'predicably', 'enough', 'game', 'pitting', 'Westfield', 'Angels', 'Screaming', 'Demons.The', 'Announcer', 'up', 'booth', 'games', 'well', 'price', 'admission', 'funniest', 'line', 'delivered', 'Westfield', 'coach', 'European', 'exchange', 'student/soccer', 'player/kicker', 'who', 'so', 'happy', 'have', 'made', 'team', 'ecstatically', 'coach', 'paraphrase', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'great', 'line', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'kissing', 'football']",Angels in the Endzone VHS
