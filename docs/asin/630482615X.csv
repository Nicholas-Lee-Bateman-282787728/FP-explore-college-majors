While at Balmoral, Mr. Brown and the Queen formed a warm friendship, but after returning to London Mr. Brown was pushed aside and forgotten.

The tonic she needs comes in the form of her old groom, John Brown, a crusty old Scotsman from Balmoral. Their relationship blooms into a beautiful friendship, but before long tongues begin to wag. This is the story of Victoria and John, and a relationship that was true and beautiful.This is a great movie. Dame Judy Dench delivers her normal excellent performance, producing a Queen Victoria that has a hard shell with a soft and vulnerable heart. Billy Connolly does a good job of presenting John Brown as a hard and uncompromising man who is always ruled by his heart...for good or for ill. This is a very moving story, with the actors bringing in a sterling performance, which makes the movie a real joy to watch.If you want to see one of the best movies you've ever seen, then get Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown!(Review of Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown starring Judy Dench and Billy Connolly)",5,One of the best movies I've ever seen,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,1039,"['years', 'death', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'husband', 'Albert', 'something', 'shake', 'depression', 'death', 'plunged', 'tonic', 'form', 'old', 'groom', 'John', 'Brown', 'crusty', 'old', 'Scotsman', 'Balmoral', 'relationship', 'blooms', 'beautiful', 'friendship', 'long', 'tongues', 'begin', 'wag', 'story', 'Victoria', 'John', 'relationship', 'was', 'true', 'beautiful.This', 'great', 'movie', 'Dame', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'normal', 'excellent', 'performance', 'producing', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'hard', 'shell', 'soft', 'vulnerable', 'heart', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'John', 'Brown', 'hard', 'uncompromising', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'ruled', 'heart', 'good', 'ill', 'very', 'moving', 'story', 'actors', 'bringing', 'sterling', 'performance', 'movie', 'real', 'joy', 'watch.If', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'then', 'get', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Mrs', 'Brown', 'Review', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'starring', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'Billy', 'Connolly']",Mrs. Brown VHS

Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[12, 12]","Queen Victoria has long been one of my favorite British monarchs, so it was with great interest I viewed this movie about her extraordinary friendship with John Brown, an outspoken, charming Scottish highlander who was her devoted manservant ... also highly admired by her late husband, Prince Albert.The Queen goes into mourning after the death of Prince Albert, and the Scotsman is the one who, by sheer guts and determination, brings her back to active life.  As their friendship grows, Brown becomes the Queen's closest friend and confidante, resulting in personal and political ramifications for both.The way the movie develops the friendship between the two main characters is exquisite in its timing and it appears the Queen and the commoner are indeed in love.  Although the film never directly addresses the issue, Brown obviously adores his Queen and she defies convention many, many times to stand by and support him.  Being an incurable romantic myself, I wish it had addressed the issue in more depth, but it was rather titillating to allow my imagination to run amok, forming my own conclusions.This romantic drama is humorous in places, and is exquisitely shot.  Sparkling, brilliant performances were given by Judi Dench as Queen Victoria, the woman behind an empire, and Billy Connolly as the robust John Brown who helped her live again, then risked his life for her on many occasions.  Another outstanding performance was given by Antony Sher who portrayed Prime Minister Disraeli with cunning malice.My heart went out to this beloved Queen, whom wagging tongues called Mrs. Brown, and her indomitable friend, Mr. Brown ... a heart-warming true story of friendship and loyalty, politics and betrayal.Don't miss this outstanding movie.SIDENOTE: You may have noticed that Amazon has made some changes to its website.

The difference between the  two classes of widows was that the Queen was not forced to face the responsibilities of life as quickly as her counter parts.  When Mr. Brown came on the scene, he re-established a familiar routine in the Queen&#8217;s life.  (We often think of routine as boring; in reality it is comforting.)  Mr. Brown was such a strong personality that he not-so-gently reminded the Queen that she too was strong enough to overcome any obstacle.

436871,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,630482615X,Dai-keag-ity,"[2, 2]","British director John Madden's well-done 1997 opus stars Dame Judi Dench as Queen Victoria, the woman of an era, and concentrates on an unlikely (and almost certainly platonic) relationship that arose during her darkest years, those that came in the time between Albert's passing in 1861 and before the resurgence of royal popularity after her Golden Jubilee in 1887.As Mrs. Brown opens, we are confronted with an emotionally-weakened Queen Victoria who is unlike the iconic figure of popular memory. Having retreated into depression and mourning, the seldom-seen Victoria's popularity is declining, and with it a vocal minority among her loyal subjects have begun to speak out about the relevance of a monarchy in a modern industrialized democracy. Though always a woman of duty, Victoria dwells in isolation, with one of her few contacts being the charming Conservative Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, well-portrayed here by Antony Sher, whose attempts to coax his queen back into London society meet with limited success.Into this predicament comes a Scotsman named John Brown, Victoria's personal servant and eventually her friend and confident during this time spent mostly in self-imposed exile at the royal estate at Balmoral. Brown, played here by the magnificently larger-than-life Billy Connolly, was a plain-spoken, rugged outdoorsman, whose loyalty and lack of formality led to a greater closeness with the queen than had existed with any man save the late Prince Albert. While as we see in this film, Victoria came to rely more and more on this rustic Scot, insiders at court, particularly the heir to the throne, Prince Edward, grew alarmed at the influence Brown might be exerting, and also speculated at the propriety of it all. As word leaked of the close bond shared by the sovereign and her servant, rumors percolated and some took the step of calling Victoria by the mocking title of ""Mrs. Brown"".John Madden is at his best directing pieces set in the past and nowhere is this more true than here. This movie utilizes an exceptionally talented cast and takes full advantage of its setting in the Scottish high country, and overall the mid-Victorian era is reproduced with a careful tidiness that lends a great deal of realism to a subject that is in many ways based on guesswork and prying speculation. Although Mrs. Brown lacks wide appeal and hasn't found its way onto many best-of film lists, it is a five-star production with very few noticeable flaws. I enjoyed seeing it in Boston when it first came out during its sadly limited theater run, and haven't regretted buying it on DVD. It's the kind of motion picture that should more often get made.",5,Was Victoria Amused?,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,2675,"['British', 'director', 'John', 'Madden', 'well-done', '1997', 'opus', 'stars', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'woman', 'era', 'concentrates', 'unlikely', 'almost', 'certainly', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'arose', 'darkest', 'years', 'came', 'time', 'Albert', 'passing', '1861', 'resurgence', 'royal', 'popularity', 'Golden', 'Jubilee', '1887.As', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'are', 'confronted', 'emotionally-weakened', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'who', 'iconic', 'figure', 'popular', 'memory', 'Having', 'retreated', 'depression', 'mourning', 'seldom-seen', 'Victoria', 'popularity', 'declining', 'vocal', 'minority', 'loyal', 'subjects', 'have', 'begun', 'speak', 'out', 'relevance', 'monarchy', 'modern', 'industrialized', 'democracy', 'Though', 'always', 'woman', 'duty', 'Victoria', 'isolation', 'one', 'few', 'contacts', 'being', 'charming', 'Conservative', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Benjamin', 'Disraeli', 'well-portrayed', 'here', 'Antony', 'Sher', 'attempts', 'coax', 'queen', 'back', 'London', 'society', 'meet', 'limited', 'success.Into', 'predicament', 'Scotsman', 'named', 'John', 'Brown', 'Victoria', 'personal', 'servant', 'eventually', 'friend', 'confident', 'time', 'spent', 'mostly', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'royal', 'estate', 'Balmoral', 'Brown', 'played', 'here', 'magnificently', 'larger-than-life', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'was', 'plain-spoken', 'rugged', 'outdoorsman', 'loyalty', 'lack', 'formality', 'led', 'greater', 'closeness', 'queen', 'had', 'existed', 'man', 'save', 'late', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'see', 'film', 'Victoria', 'came', 'rely', 'more', 'more', 'rustic', 'Scot', 'insiders', 'court', 'particularly', 'heir', 'throne', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'grew', 'alarmed', 'influence', 'Brown', 'might', 'be', 'exerting', 'also', 'speculated', 'propriety', 'word', 'leaked', 'close', 'bond', 'shared', 'sovereign', 'servant', 'rumors', 'percolated', 'took', 'step', 'calling', 'Victoria', 'mocking', 'title', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', '.John', 'Madden', 'best', 'directing', 'pieces', 'set', 'past', 'nowhere', 'more', 'true', 'here', 'movie', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'cast', 'full', 'advantage', 'setting', 'Scottish', 'high', 'country', 'overall', 'mid-Victorian', 'era', 'reproduced', 'careful', 'tidiness', 'great', 'deal', 'realism', 'subject', 'many', 'ways', 'based', 'guesswork', 'prying', 'speculation', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'wide', 'appeal', ""n't"", 'found', 'way', 'many', 'best-of', 'film', 'lists', 'five-star', 'production', 'very', 'few', 'noticeable', 'flaws', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Boston', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'sadly', 'limited', 'theater', 'run', 'have', ""n't"", 'regretted', 'buying', 'DVD', 'kind', 'motion', 'picture', 'should', 'more', 'often', 'get', 'made']",Mrs. Brown VHS

It is absolutely brilliant.This is a story of a unique friendship formed between two very unlike characters: Queen Victoria and her servant Mr. Brown. As the story developed I was completely absorbed by the lives of these two people, as if I was actually part of it rather then watching the film.Story is incredibly well told (though I do wish filmmakers were not in such a rush to end it), cinematography is absolutely beautiful and as far as the historical part of the movie it was perfectly captured. And then there are actors involved in this movie.I do not think that my knowledge of English language will allow me to fully describe superb talent of Judi Dench, which by all means is unmatched by anyone alive today. Her performance was absolutely flawless.  Academy should be ashamed for not awarding her with an Oscar and choosing Helen Hunt's performance over hers. Not even a contest in my opinion.As incredible as Judi Dench is I'm sure it is very hard to find costars that will not be completely overshadowed by her. But Billy Connelly filled the screen with his brilliant performance. Perfect chemistry between the two. And of course - Geoffrey Palmer who happens to be Judi's long time costar from BBC's ""As Time Goes By"" (which I think is one of the best TV comedies of all time). When you get so caught up in a movie that you forget it's not a real life you know that actors are doing an incredible job.This is an exceptionally well made film, a stunning piece of cinematography.

436873,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,630482615X,D. Blankenship,"[3, 3]","First I will get the ""techie"" stuff over with.  My wife and I watched this movie via the Amazon Prime program.  The download was perfect and the quality of the picture and sound were excellent.  We had no problems with it what so ever.Now that being said...What a beguiling this film was.  When I view a film whose story or theme is based on history, I am not one of those people who go berserk is the makers of the film stray from historical facts and use their artistic license to ""enhance"" the story.  The study of his history more or less belongs with the written word more or less or at least films which are distinctly labeled ""documentaries.""  Hey, I like to be entertained on one or more levels.  It is a pure delight to find a film that not only entertains, is well done, and pretty much historically accurate to boot.  In this film we had it all.  (Note:  Due to the rather intimate and personal subject matter, i.e. a story dealing with the thoughts and feelings of individuals there is of course ""speculation,"" but I feel the writers and producers of this film did a pretty good job in this area.This is the story of the great Queen Victoria, a historically fascinating woman, and her relationship with a gruff, somewhat crude and outspoken Highlander who joined Victoria's staff after the death of her beloved Prince Albert passed away.  The story is of their personal relationship as it develops throughout the film until the death of John Brown.  This of course is a period piece and from my point of view it is almost perfectly done as far as the costuming and set design goes.  The scenery in the film is nothing less than spectacular and I would watch this movie again, with the sound off, just to view it again.Dame Judy Dench plays the bereaved, depressed and devastated Victoria.  I have never seen Dench in a part that I did not like and this film is no exception.  Billy Connolly plays the gruff and somewhat unsophisticated highlander who is called upon by Victoria, primarily due to the fact that her Prince Albert thought so much of him.  We watch as a relationship develops between the queen and this commoner.  Was there love involved here?  I suspect there was at some level; at the very least there was extreme devotion and a mutual respect the developed between the two that went far beyond queen and servant or even between two close friends.I felt that the portrayal of the relationship between Victoria and the rest of her family pretty well followed the facts as I know them.  Some have said that this is a gloomy movie with little or no humor involved.  I have to disagree.  The humor was most certainly there, subtle at times I grant you, but it most certainly was there.  As to the gloom accusation....I suppose that would be in the eye of the beholder.  Yes, there was sheen of sadness but that is only natural.  Victoria and Albert had one of the closest and loving relationships of any of the royal families and were absolutely devoted to each other.  The loss of Albert was a blow to Victoria of which she never fully recovered.  Hey, life is not all happy, happy, happy.Both my wife and I enjoyed this production and will quite likely watch it again in the near future.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,THIS ONE HAD EVERTHING WE PERSONALLY LOOK FOR IN A FILM.,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3237,"['First', 'will', 'get', 'techie', 'stuff', 'wife', 'watched', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'program', 'download', 'was', 'perfect', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'were', 'excellent', 'had', 'problems', 'so', 'being', 'said', 'What', 'beguiling', 'film', 'was', 'When', 'view', 'film', 'story', 'theme', 'based', 'history', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'berserk', 'makers', 'film', 'stray', 'historical', 'facts', 'use', 'artistic', 'license', 'enhance', 'story', 'study', 'history', 'more', 'less', 'belongs', 'written', 'word', 'more', 'less', 'least', 'films', 'are', 'distinctly', 'labeled', 'documentaries', 'Hey', 'like', 'be', 'entertained', 'one', 'more', 'levels', 'pure', 'delight', 'find', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'well', 'done', 'pretty', 'much', 'historically', 'accurate', 'boot', 'film', 'had', 'Note', 'Due', 'rather', 'intimate', 'personal', 'subject', 'matter', 'i.e', 'story', 'dealing', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'individuals', 'course', 'speculation', 'feel', 'writers', 'producers', 'film', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'area.This', 'story', 'great', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'historically', 'fascinating', 'woman', 'relationship', 'gruff', 'somewhat', 'crude', 'outspoken', 'Highlander', 'who', 'joined', 'Victoria', 'staff', 'death', 'beloved', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'passed', 'away', 'story', 'personal', 'relationship', 'film', 'death', 'John', 'Brown', 'course', 'period', 'piece', 'point', 'view', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'done', 'as', 'far', 'costuming', 'set', 'design', 'scenery', 'film', 'nothing', 'less', 'spectacular', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'sound', 'just', 'view', 'again.Dame', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'bereaved', 'depressed', 'devastated', 'Victoria', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Dench', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'exception', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'gruff', 'somewhat', 'unsophisticated', 'highlander', 'who', 'called', 'Victoria', 'primarily', 'due', 'fact', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'thought', 'so', 'much', 'watch', 'relationship', 'queen', 'commoner', 'Was', 'there', 'involved', 'here', 'suspect', 'was', 'level', 'very', 'least', 'was', 'extreme', 'devotion', 'mutual', 'respect', 'developed', 'two', 'went', 'far', 'queen', 'servant', 'even', 'two', 'close', 'friends.I', 'felt', 'portrayal', 'relationship', 'Victoria', 'rest', 'family', 'pretty', 'well', 'followed', 'facts', 'know', 'have', 'said', 'gloomy', 'movie', 'little', 'humor', 'involved', 'have', 'disagree', 'humor', 'was', 'most', 'certainly', 'there', 'subtle', 'times', 'grant', 'most', 'certainly', 'was', 'there', 'gloom', 'accusation', 'suppose', 'would', 'be', 'eye', 'beholder', 'Yes', 'was', 'sheen', 'sadness', 'only', 'natural', 'Victoria', 'Albert', 'had', 'one', 'closest', 'loving', 'relationships', 'royal', 'families', 'were', 'absolutely', 'devoted', 'other', 'loss', 'Albert', 'was', 'blow', 'Victoria', 'never', 'fully', 'recovered', 'Hey', 'life', 'not', 'happy', 'happy', 'happy.Both', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'production', 'will', 'quite', 'likely', 'watch', 'again', 'near', 'future.Don', 'BlankenshipThe', 'Ozarks']",Mrs. Brown VHS

436881,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,630482615X,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","MRS. BROWN (Originally and a/k/a HER MAJESTY MRS. BROWN, Dir. John Madden, Writ. Jeremy Brock, 1997, 105 minutes) is the touching story of the blooming friendship between the widowed Queen Victoria (Dame Judi Dench shining in an early major role) and her personal Highland servant John Brown (Billy Connolly also brilliant in an almost exclusive major dramatic role).The irrepressible Dame Judi Dench was truly launched as an international star in this film. Her brooding, angry portrayal of Queen Victoria stands out even today. Of crucial importance to this film is the portrayal of John Brown by Billy Connolly, truly his greatest film work. He was robbed of an Oscar here only because this is a PBS television production. The ambience, almost creepy until one recalls it's HER era (Victorian), is enthralling; dark, misty, then sunny, first at the Isle of Wight then at Balmoral ... one can truly smell and taste the film.Beginning circa 1864 at Osbourne House on the Isle of Wight, MRS. BROWN tells the story of a concerned Court summoning Brown in an attempt to draw the queen out of her two-years-long deep grief over the loss of Prince Albert. Of course the moment the viewer sees Connolly scowling that famous Glasgow scowl, we know Brown is something - or, rather, someone - else entirely than the pasty-faced quivering Court.Spanning roughly two decades, the story unfolds with dramatic precision, in the most stunning locations and the finest supporting cast one could want for the period: Geoffrey Palmer, Antony Sher, Gerard Butler, Richard Pasco, David Westhead, Sara Stewart, and Jimmy Chisholm (a/k/a Jimmy Chisolm). The soundtrack is unobtrusive yet majestic enough to keep us on our toes: the perfect soundtrack. As the narrative moves from the Isle of Wight to Balmoral and finally to London, we get a powerful impression of being there.Never has a film given me that close a feeling to the times. Everything is felt here, from the constitutional crisis Victoria caused by hiding in mourning for so many years to the total lack of innuendo that in real life caused all of England to vibrate with rumors. When Exxon Mobil and PBS televised this film, there was serious doubt the queen would have had such a close relationship with a servant. Giving a satisfying film about that is not an easy thing, when one considers the usual fate of this type of production. One thing's for sure: the film gives Merchant and Ivory a run for their money. It also saddens one to see Billy Connolly would never again attain the heights he reached here.Today we know there was likely a sexual relationship, a rumor about a marriage and a daughter, Jean Brown, who was spirited away to America, and at least one letter (just made public in 2007) in which the queen said the death of Brown left her feeling widowed for a second time. So this film is absolutely indispensible, not only for its all-too-rare artistry, but the very real love that the queen shared with a coarse, drunken Highland servant.Well, let me initiate you into a little secret: Christina Zeepvat's fabulous biography of Prince Leopold, Victoria's youngest son--Queen Victoria's Youngest Son--will disabuse you of the notion of this film's dashing, heroic John Brown. The film has a telling few seconds when Brown asks his brother Archie which one is Prince Leopold.

436888,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,630482615X,.fgd,"[1, 5]","It is a somewhat stuffy film because it explores so little of the relationship between the queen and John Brown. The plot runs along the lines of bare historical fact filled out to give a sense of her reign. Meanwhile don't look for in depth tete-a-tete scenes between them. Queen Dench veers across starchy hearty and needy and Mr Connolly never leaves his post as faithful hound.Since the film is exactly supposed to be about their relationship why is it so skimpy ? Because it duitifully seeks to follow the accepted history. This is strange because the queen's over-familiarity with a servant hiding away in the highlands was contentious in its day .  This film must have been  written and produced by pro-monarchists meanwhile the British take a leery delight in Royalty as with the poor present day Queen made to parachute into the Olympic stadium recently . There is of course a flip side to the dashingness of parachuting because in a dress it would in theory show her panties to any subject peering upwards. That is all the thanks she gets for being  an utter professional. So in this day and age Queen Victoria's "" lechery"" is hardly a national traumaPeering back in history the question still remains.....well did the queen or didn't she ??. The film swerves in this aspect  by a short scene which alludes fleetingly to its possability. Here the Queen and Brown visit Mr and Mrs Grant in what could be their game-keeper's lodge...... far from the prying eyes of Balmoral castle.  It is mind-boggling to watch the queen lay the table but point taken. It is remarked on her return that she smells of whiskey looks flushed and might be drunk. "" Don't even think of it.!!!"" snaps her advisor to the retainer. It is the film's advice to us the viewers .Although her biography is not ashamed to write she liked a drink. Not merely winebut mixed with whiskey. That's a stiff drink. Naturally the film doesn't hesitate to show John Brown supplementing from his wee flask. Who taught her to add whiskey? Him of course because they drank together. Everyone knows how dis-inhibiting and an aphrodisiac alcohol is to the most cognitavly organised and prudish After the first shagg the unthinkable had been breached and having lost her virginity in this respect she did not renege because she wanted to be close to a man again after her husband.With the stirrings of republicanism the establishment closed ranks. Not to have done so would have created anarchy. Even her Doctor's records were destroyed. The aristocracy and royalty through the ages throughout Europe were forever sinning openly or out of public eye. To her peers Victoria was no anomaly (even if extra-naughty being female)In this day and age it is hard to see why a film like this would go through the bother of painting another Virgin Queen.

Of course, when one thinks of Victoria, the idea of prudishness, conservatism, and a very reserved manner in action and morality naturally come to mind. It was never unusual for monarchs, male or female, to have lovers outside of their marriages (indeed, it might be considered unusual for a monarch to have been thought to have remained faithful), but Victoria? The epitome of a repressive, almost oppresive morality? Surely not.Don't be so sure.Four years after the death of Prince Albert, to whom Victoria was completely devoted, and for whom she mourned in quite public and dramatic fashion, against the protests of her children and her ministers, John Brown, a favourite ghillie of the royal couple, was brought back into service of the Queen household.Victoria's favouritism toward him, coupled with his own brash and blunt behaviour, caused him to be envied and disliked by members of her family, her household service, her ministers, and largely by the public. There were parodies of John Brown's activities, done up in the form of mock Court Circulars (the official listing of royal engagements), which appeared in the press on both sides of the Atlantic.It is unknown if Brown actually kept a diary (the movie speculates such, but also states that no diary was ever found). There was a large black trunk of correspondence found after Victoria's death, between the Queen and her doctor at the time, Profeit, regarding John Brown. This came into the possession of her new doctor, Reid, who recorded 'most compromising' secrets into his green memorandum book. Alas, this book was burned by Reid's son, and the trunk was not found. Did it refer to a secret marriage between Victoria and John Brown, as was often speculated?This is, in truth, unlikely -- Victoria's devotion to Albert never waned in her life, and there was a certain innocence, lack of pretense and guile in Victoria that the more political and suspicious (particularly in the press) would not have known. Both Brown and Victoria were outraged at the rumours. Brown was a servant who put no stock in class divisions and the artificiality of social conventions -- his familiarity with the Queen (in fact no different from his direct and familiar manner of relating to everyone) was simply his manner.But then, everyone likes a good, juicy scandal, don't they? So much more interesting than decades of mourning, which makes for rather boring news leaders.The film takes up the story with Brown's arrival at the royal residence on the Isle of Wight (an inaccuracy, as he was presented at Windsor first). The story is romantic yet reserved, and the cinematography is stunning. From the cloud-cast home on the Isle of Wight to the stately and foreboding Windsor scenes, to the unspoiled Highlands around Balmoral, this film has had great care infused in the details of costume, setting, and atmosphere.Judi Dench gives perhaps the greatest performance of her life as the Queen, showing real emotion through the Victorian reserve in an admirable fashion (for which she was nominated for the Academy Award, and won the Golden Globe, as best actress). In a really surprising casting, Billy Connolly, best known as a comic, turns in a first class performance as John Brown, the brash Scotsman who becomes completely devoted to his Queen. Geoffrey Palmer, a solid actor known in many BBC productions, plays the Queen's private secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, who is continually amazed at the liberties taken by Brown (Ponsonby, in reality, saw Brown as a first class servant, and remarked so frequently in correspondence with others). This film was first proposed as a BBC television production, but ended up being so well performed and executed that it was transferred to become a cinematic release.Given the high profile scandals of the royal family today, this story seems almost timid. But, history does repeat itself, so one can never be entirely sure, until such time as the royal archives are opened to scholars, perhaps a few centuries from now, and the truth may be known to posterity.",5,Did she or didn't she?,1054252800,"05 30, 2003",2003,4077,"['question', 'course', 'when', 'one', 'Victoria', 'idea', 'prudishness', 'conservatism', 'very', 'reserved', 'manner', 'action', 'morality', 'naturally', 'come', 'mind', 'was', 'never', 'unusual', 'monarchs', 'male', 'female', 'have', 'lovers', 'marriages', 'indeed', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'unusual', 'monarch', 'have', 'been', 'thought', 'have', 'remained', 'faithful', 'Victoria', 'epitome', 'repressive', 'almost', 'oppresive', 'morality', 'Surely', 'not.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'sure.Four', 'years', 'death', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'whom', 'Victoria', 'was', 'completely', 'devoted', 'whom', 'mourned', 'quite', 'public', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'protests', 'children', 'ministers', 'John', 'Brown', 'favourite', 'ghillie', 'royal', 'couple', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'service', 'Queen', 'household.Victoria', 'favouritism', 'coupled', 'own', 'brash', 'blunt', 'behaviour', 'caused', 'be', 'envied', 'disliked', 'members', 'family', 'household', 'service', 'ministers', 'largely', 'public', 'were', 'parodies', 'John', 'Brown', 'activities', 'done', 'up', 'form', 'mock', 'Court', 'Circulars', 'official', 'listing', 'royal', 'engagements', 'appeared', 'press', 'sides', 'Atlantic.It', 'unknown', 'Brown', 'actually', 'kept', 'diary', 'movie', 'such', 'also', 'diary', 'was', 'ever', 'found', 'was', 'large', 'black', 'trunk', 'correspondence', 'found', 'Victoria', 'death', 'Queen', 'doctor', 'time', 'Profeit', 'regarding', 'John', 'Brown', 'came', 'possession', 'new', 'doctor', 'Reid', 'who', 'recorded', ""'most"", 'compromising', 'secrets', 'green', 'memorandum', 'book', 'Alas', 'book', 'was', 'burned', 'Reid', 'son', 'trunk', 'was', 'not', 'found', 'Did', 'refer', 'secret', 'marriage', 'Victoria', 'John', 'Brown', 'was', 'often', 'speculated', 'truth', 'unlikely', 'Victoria', 'devotion', 'Albert', 'never', 'waned', 'life', 'there', 'was', 'certain', 'innocence', 'lack', 'pretense', 'guile', 'Victoria', 'more', 'political', 'suspicious', 'particularly', 'press', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'Brown', 'Victoria', 'were', 'outraged', 'rumours', 'Brown', 'was', 'servant', 'who', 'put', 'stock', 'class', 'divisions', 'artificiality', 'social', 'conventions', 'familiarity', 'Queen', 'fact', 'different', 'direct', 'familiar', 'manner', 'relating', 'everyone', 'was', 'simply', 'manner.But', 'then', 'everyone', 'good', 'juicy', 'scandal', 'do', ""n't"", 'So', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'decades', 'mourning', 'rather', 'boring', 'news', 'leaders.The', 'film', 'up', 'story', 'Brown', 'arrival', 'royal', 'residence', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'inaccuracy', 'was', 'presented', 'Windsor', 'first', 'story', 'romantic', 'yet', 'reserved', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'cloud-cast', 'home', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'stately', 'foreboding', 'Windsor', 'scenes', 'unspoiled', 'Highlands', 'Balmoral', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'care', 'infused', 'details', 'costume', 'setting', 'atmosphere.Judi', 'Dench', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'performance', 'life', 'Queen', 'showing', 'real', 'emotion', 'Victorian', 'reserve', 'admirable', 'fashion', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'best', 'actress', 'really', 'surprising', 'casting', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'best', 'known', 'comic', 'first', 'class', 'performance', 'John', 'Brown', 'brash', 'Scotsman', 'who', 'completely', 'devoted', 'Queen', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'solid', 'actor', 'known', 'many', 'BBC', 'productions', 'Queen', 'private', 'secretary', 'Sir', 'Henry', 'Ponsonby', 'who', 'continually', 'amazed', 'liberties', 'taken', 'Brown', 'Ponsonby', 'reality', 'saw', 'Brown', 'first', 'class', 'servant', 'remarked', 'so', 'frequently', 'correspondence', 'others', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'proposed', 'BBC', 'television', 'production', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'so', 'well', 'performed', 'executed', 'was', 'transferred', 'become', 'cinematic', 'release.Given', 'high', 'profile', 'scandals', 'royal', 'family', 'today', 'story', 'almost', 'timid', 'history', 'repeat', 'so', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'entirely', 'sure', 'such', 'time', 'royal', 'archives', 'are', 'opened', 'scholars', 'perhaps', 'few', 'centuries', 'now', 'truth', 'may', 'be', 'known', 'posterity']",Mrs. Brown VHS

BROWN as written by Jeremy Brock and directed by John Madden (Proof, Shakespeare in Love, Captain Corelli's Mandolin) is a sprightly, entertaining and engrossing study of a moment in the life of enigmatic Queen Victoria.  Selecting an outstanding production crew and a fine cast this film succeeds on every level and once again proves to us that Judi Dench is one of the finest actresses on the stage or screen today.The story revolves around the time when Queen Victoria's beloved husband Prince Albert dies resulting in a clinical depression in the queen.  She leaves London with her entourage to grieve at Balmoral Castle. There her Scottish Highlander servant John Brown (Billy Connolly) nurses her back to normalcy but in the meanwhile sets up the appearance of an affair that scandalized the British Isles.  Disraeli (Antony Sher) visits in an attempt to right the situation but it is Brown's strong personality - an equal match for the wise and wily Victoria - that alters the course of events that returns Queen Victoria to her proper station.Dench and Connolly play so well off each other that their relationship has a wealth of charm, tenderness, bite, wit, and solidity.  The supporting cast includes a fine turn by Gerard Butler as Archie Brown, John's supportive and playful brother.  The costumes are superb and the cinematography by Richard Greatrex  captures the atmosphere of the cloying indoor spaces as well as the freedom of the vast coastline vistas.  Stephen Warbeck  is responsible for the well-integrated musical score.  Highly recommended.

Shot primarily in Scotland, in one of the lochs regions so remote and beautiful you can scarcely believe it still exists, the film does a great job of casting us back to the period, and the action flows so consistently that you'll never be bored.  In the end, it also made me want to learn more about Mr. Brown and re-learn what little I knew about Disraeli.The head of Britain's National Theatre once said of Dame Judi Dench, ""When you talk about Judi, you unpack a suitcase full of superlatives.""  That's as true of her role in ""Mrs. Brown"" as of any other film or play of hers.  She's great in this film, playing Queen Victoria with all the necessary pomposity, but also getting across the vulnerability of the old girl in a tremendously subtle and graceful performance that almost makes you feel you're watching the real person.Then there's Billy Connolly as John Brown, the ""common"" Highlander gillie to whom Queen Victoria turned after three years of mourning her husband, Prince Albert, who died prematurely.  Brown was known to be substantially more brusque and commanding, but also more gentle, with the Queen than anyone else around her was allowed to be. Connolly not only portrays that wonderfully, but being the hilarious comedian he is, also spikes the role with humor and spirit that we can only hope the original Brown actually possessed.The DVD itself is fine, but this is one of the few times that I would have loved to see more about the making of the film.  While I don't care about the period clothing or some of the other things that are often put on DVDs, the castles and the estates are intriguing and, with Billy Connolly as one of the stars, I would LOVE to see what must be hilarious outtakes from the film.",4,"Royalty, Romance & Running Naked Into Lochs",1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,1886,"['Everything', 'want', 'historically-accurate', 'period', 'piece', 'hidden', 'emotions', 'devout', 'loyalty', 'honor', 'biographical', 'insight', 'bits', 'quirky', 'humor', 'Shot', 'primarily', 'Scotland', 'one', 'lochs', 'regions', 'so', 'remote', 'beautiful', 'can', 'scarcely', 'believe', 'still', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'casting', 'back', 'period', 'action', 'so', 'consistently', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'bored', 'end', 'also', 'made', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 're-learn', 'what', 'little', 'knew', 'Disraeli.The', 'head', 'Britain', 'National', 'Theatre', 'once', 'said', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'When', 'talk', 'Judi', 'unpack', 'suitcase', 'full', 'superlatives', 'true', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'other', 'film', 'play', 'hers', 'great', 'film', 'playing', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'necessary', 'pomposity', 'also', 'getting', 'vulnerability', 'old', 'girl', 'tremendously', 'subtle', 'graceful', 'performance', 'almost', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'real', 'person.Then', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'John', 'Brown', 'common', 'Highlander', 'gillie', 'whom', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'turned', 'three', 'years', 'mourning', 'husband', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'who', 'died', 'prematurely', 'Brown', 'was', 'known', 'be', 'substantially', 'more', 'brusque', 'commanding', 'also', 'more', 'gentle', 'Queen', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'allowed', 'be', 'Connolly', 'not', 'only', 'wonderfully', 'being', 'hilarious', 'comedian', 'also', 'role', 'humor', 'spirit', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'original', 'Brown', 'actually', 'DVD', 'fine', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'making', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'period', 'clothing', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'often', 'put', 'DVDs', 'castles', 'estates', 'are', 'intriguing', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'one', 'stars', 'would', 'LOVE', 'see', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', 'film']",Mrs. Brown VHS

436898,A364VIQ3KLAWVX,630482615X,H. M Pyles,"[91, 100]","This movie leaves me in a quandary.  I like costume dramas, and I have a particular fondness for depictions of the private lives of royals.  This fondness, combined with the general paucity of such movies, causes me to cut them considerable slack regarding historical accuracy.This movie was not too far off the mark in terms of hard fact.  The death of Prince Albert really did send Queen Victoria into an excessively-prolonged grieving and withdrawal from public duties that began to unsettle the political equilibrium of Britain's constitutional monarchy.  And there really was a John Brown, he was Scot, he was in service to Prince Albert at Balmoral, and he became a much-depended-upon personal attendant to Queen Victoria during her widowhood.  All these things are accurately reflected in this movie.So what's my quandary?Well, the movie just feels wrong ""tonally"".  Some movies about royalty take such liberties with the truth that they become purely dramatic constructs with no pretense to accuracy (and they can be fine entertainment).  But when they seem to be conscientious about accuracy, as this movie appeared to be, the standard -- at least for me -- extends to include not just dramatic impact, but realistic portrayal of the complex, burdened, exposed, and heavily-examined lives reigning monarchs lived.Judi Dench does her usual top-notch job of creating a sense of a character.  But is it Victoria's character?  Among her family, was she really an unrelentingly dour, domineering, censorious creature capable of opening her soul only to a servant?  If her surviving correspondence and the recollections of her vast array of grandchildren peppered all over Europe are to be credited, the answer is no.While Albert's death admittedly paralyzed Victoria emotionally for too long, she was never as cavalier about the effects of her withdrawal on politics as this movie implies.  The monarchy was in a sorry state when she took it over in 1837, with the public and statesmen of the era having thoroughly tired of the spendthrift rake who preceeded her.  She (and Albert, after their marriage in 1840) made it their mission to restore the monarchy to respectability and political impact, and Victoria never took that duty lightly.Billy Connolly also gives us a vibrant character.  But was it John Brown's?  We know Brown was outspoken and that he stood his ground on occasion with the Prince of Wales and other family and staff members.  But being outspoken and resolute is one thing.  Being so in as rude and confrontational a manner as possible is something else . . . and something almost inconceivable when dealing with royalty in that era.  We know the real John Brown gained the trust, respect, and perhaps emotional attachment of Victoria.  But did he really do so by bellowing ""woman"" at her in front of her court?  Highly unlikely.  Victoria was a human with personal needs.  But she understood full well that she was also the representative of an institution that could survive only if it commanded a certain regal reserve and respect from all.Paradoxically, this movie is weakened by getting so close to accuracy and then missing on such subtle -- but profound -- points.  There was something very complex going on between Victoria and John Brown.  In treating their relationship as high melodrama, this movie misses that complexity.",3,Dramatic License and Then Some,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,3358,"['movie', 'quandary', 'like', 'costume', 'dramas', 'have', 'particular', 'fondness', 'depictions', 'private', 'lives', 'royals', 'fondness', 'combined', 'general', 'paucity', 'such', 'movies', 'cut', 'considerable', 'slack', 'regarding', 'historical', 'accuracy.This', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'mark', 'terms', 'hard', 'fact', 'death', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'really', 'did', 'send', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'excessively-prolonged', 'grieving', 'withdrawal', 'public', 'duties', 'began', 'unsettle', 'political', 'equilibrium', 'Britain', 'constitutional', 'monarchy', 'really', 'was', 'John', 'Brown', 'was', 'Scot', 'was', 'service', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'Balmoral', 'became', 'much-depended-upon', 'personal', 'attendant', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'widowhood', 'things', 'are', 'accurately', 'reflected', 'movie.So', 'what', 'quandary', 'Well', 'movie', 'just', 'feels', 'wrong', 'tonally', 'movies', 'royalty', 'take', 'such', 'liberties', 'truth', 'become', 'purely', 'dramatic', 'constructs', 'pretense', 'accuracy', 'can', 'be', 'fine', 'entertainment', 'when', 'seem', 'be', 'conscientious', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'appeared', 'be', 'standard', 'least', 'include', 'not', 'just', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'complex', 'burdened', 'exposed', 'heavily-examined', 'lives', 'reigning', 'monarchs', 'lived.Judi', 'Dench', 'usual', 'top-notch', 'job', 'creating', 'sense', 'character', 'Victoria', 'character', 'family', 'was', 'really', 'unrelentingly', 'dour', 'domineering', 'censorious', 'creature', 'capable', 'opening', 'soul', 'only', 'servant', 'surviving', 'correspondence', 'recollections', 'vast', 'array', 'grandchildren', 'peppered', 'Europe', 'are', 'be', 'credited', 'answer', 'no.While', 'Albert', 'death', 'admittedly', 'paralyzed', 'Victoria', 'emotionally', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'never', 'cavalier', 'effects', 'withdrawal', 'politics', 'movie', 'monarchy', 'was', 'sorry', 'state', 'when', 'took', 'over', '1837', 'public', 'statesmen', 'era', 'having', 'thoroughly', 'tired', 'spendthrift', 'rake', 'who', 'preceeded', 'Albert', 'marriage', '1840', 'made', 'mission', 'restore', 'monarchy', 'respectability', 'political', 'impact', 'Victoria', 'never', 'took', 'duty', 'lightly.Billy', 'Connolly', 'also', 'vibrant', 'character', 'was', 'John', 'Brown', 'know', 'Brown', 'was', 'outspoken', 'stood', 'ground', 'occasion', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'other', 'family', 'staff', 'members', 'being', 'outspoken', 'resolute', 'one', 'thing', 'Being', 'so', 'rude', 'confrontational', 'manner', 'possible', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'almost', 'inconceivable', 'when', 'dealing', 'royalty', 'era', 'know', 'real', 'John', 'Brown', 'gained', 'trust', 'respect', 'perhaps', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'Victoria', 'did', 'really', 'do', 'so', 'bellowing', 'woman', 'front', 'court', 'Highly', 'unlikely', 'Victoria', 'was', 'human', 'personal', 'needs', 'understood', 'full', 'well', 'was', 'also', 'representative', 'institution', 'could', 'survive', 'only', 'commanded', 'certain', 'regal', 'reserve', 'respect', 'all.Paradoxically', 'movie', 'weakened', 'getting', 'so', 'close', 'accuracy', 'then', 'missing', 'such', 'subtle', 'profound', 'points', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'complex', 'going', 'Victoria', 'John', 'Brown', 'treating', 'relationship', 'high', 'melodrama', 'movie', 'complexity']",Mrs. Brown VHS

As good as the acting and production are, one comes away with the feeling that the filmmakers were so uncomfortable confronting the possibility of a romance between this mismatched duo that they managed to avoid the essence of the story.  Most likely nothing more than mutual respect existed between these two characters, but how much more satisfying as a piece of drama Mrs. Brown would have been if the so-called 'facts' could have been slightly bent to tell a warmer, more romantic saga.It's difficult when adapting from history not to let diplomacy reign, but when there's as much potential as lurks behind the curtains in Mrs. Brown, it's pathetic not to take some creative license and let those two damn people fall passionately in love.  All those who aspire to filming historical dramas be bold - chances are you won't be tracked down by the late Queen's relatives and slapped unconscious with a handful of haggis.As a footnote, keep an eye on Gerard Butler as Billy Connolly's long-suffering brother.

It is a professional and well-made film that deserves your time. Mrs. Brown was nominated for 2 Academy Awards, Best Actress and Best Makeup, and although it didn't pick up the Oscar, in my book, it deserved to. It also deserved to take home more nominations, and more awards.Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) is deeply depressed after the death of her husband, disappearing from public. Her servant Mr. John Brown (Billy Connolly), who adores her, through caress and admiration brings her back to life, but that relationship creates scandalous situation and is likely to lead to monarchy crisis.The story is sometimes confusing, and the end seemed a little rushed to me, but Mrs. Brown is still a visually easy on the eye, meticulously crafted drama with a touch of emotional romance. It's not as if Queen Victoria is in love with Mr. John Brown, it's more that she is in love with the subject of falling in love. It may seem odd reading it now, but once you've watched the film, you'll understand perfectly. The film is very brutal and full-frontal, but it sometimes stops for a touch of comedic humour, some of it funny, some of it not so funny. As for performances, it goes without saying that Judi Dench is absolutely masterful in her controlled performance as Queen Victoria. It's a truly memorable performance, a homage to the real Queen. Billy Connolly is amazing as the honest Brown, he brings the days of truthful royalty to our screens with power and divine emotion.Mrs. Brown, directed by John Madden, is a frequently stunning picture, and although it could be a snoozer for teen audiences, for real movie-goer's, it's a must-see, a magnificent film you definitely won't want to be sleeping through.",4,Stunningly indepedent,986601600,"04 7, 2001",2001,1852,"['Mrs.', 'BrownScore', '82/100Although', 'film', 'kind', 'TV-film', 'feel', 'far', 'standards', 'such', 'TV', 'movies', 'Absence', 'Good', 'professional', 'well-made', 'film', 'time', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'was', 'nominated', '2', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Makeup', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'Oscar', 'book', 'deserved', 'also', 'deserved', 'take', 'home', 'more', 'nominations', 'more', 'awards.Queen', 'Victoria', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'deeply', 'depressed', 'death', 'husband', 'disappearing', 'public', 'servant', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Brown', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'who', 'caress', 'admiration', 'back', 'life', 'relationship', 'scandalous', 'situation', 'likely', 'lead', 'monarchy', 'crisis.The', 'story', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'end', 'seemed', 'little', 'rushed', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'still', 'visually', 'easy', 'eye', 'meticulously', 'crafted', 'drama', 'touch', 'emotional', 'romance', 'not', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'love', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Brown', 'more', 'love', 'subject', 'falling', 'love', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'reading', 'now', 'once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'perfectly', 'film', 'very', 'brutal', 'full-frontal', 'sometimes', 'touch', 'comedic', 'humour', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'performances', 'saying', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'absolutely', 'masterful', 'controlled', 'performance', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'truly', 'memorable', 'performance', 'homage', 'real', 'Queen', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'amazing', 'honest', 'Brown', 'days', 'truthful', 'royalty', 'screens', 'power', 'divine', 'emotion.Mrs', 'Brown', 'directed', 'John', 'Madden', 'frequently', 'stunning', 'picture', 'could', 'be', 'snoozer', 'teen', 'audiences', 'real', 'movie-goer', 'must-see', 'magnificent', 'film', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'sleeping']",Mrs. Brown VHS

The love affair depicted in this movie is a much different one---between the best friends and is sensitively and masterfully done.  Judi Dench is simply a knock-out as Queen Victoria.  Even at her sternest, a small smile seems to be lurking about her mouth.  She broke my heart confessing her feelings toward Brown.  Billy Connolly, also, is just superb.  His Brown is unfailingly loyal, even in the face of abandonment, and his unflinching love for Victoria is heartrending.  I LOVED this movie, from beginning to end.

436936,A319KYEIAZ3SON,630482615X,Mary Whipple,"[6, 6]","After Prince Albert died in 1859, his memory was so alive to Queen Victoria, and her mourning for him was so dramatic that she virtually retired from the throne.  Three years after Prince Albert's death, while the Queen was living in seclusion at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, John Brown was hired to tend her horses.  A rough, virile man, far more accustomed to life in the wild than in royal castles, Brown treated the queen with respect, but he also treated her as a fellow human being, refusing to obey court etiquette while encouraging her to improve her health and spirits by riding in the hills.  In time, he came to be her confidante, so much so that the royal family became alarmed at their relationship and members of Parliament began referring to her, mockingly, as ""Mrs. Brown.""Judi Dench, in one of her best roles, is a wonderfully sympathetic Queen Victoria--haughty with those who try to control her, angry with those who cross her, and vulnerable to someone like Brown, who understands her loneliness and is determined to protect her.  Billy Connolly is perfect as John Brown--rough, craggy-faced, full of life, and unafraid to tell the queen exactly what he thinks, a trait the queen comes to respect.  Scenes between them show the queen in all her reserve slowly responding to Brown's honesty and inherent charm, and though there was no affair (though all the film publicity suggests otherwise), the depth of their emotional attachment is obvious.Filmed on location in the Scottish highlands and at Duns Castle on the Scottish Borders in 1998, this production features wonderfully intimate scenes of everyday royal life, including the full retinue of servants and ladies-in-waiting, the queen's enormous family, the impatient Prince of Wales, and many luminaries of history--especially Benjamin Disraeli (Antony Sher) and Lord Henry Ponsonby (Geoffrey Palmer), both of whom try to act in the queen's best interests while also protecting their own.  As the queen responds to Mr. Brown's care, the slow, subtle effects on her everyday life become clear to the viewer through the remarkably acted scenes between Dench and Connolly.  Dench won many Best Actress awards for her role here, and Connolly was nominated for an almost equal number for his role.A gorgeous costume drama with a large cast, the film focuses on just two people--Dench and Connolly, both of whom are so overwhelming in their roles that everything else becomes peripheral.  n Mary Whipple",5,"""I think I am someone who can only feel things when they are alive to me.""",1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,2473,"['Prince', 'Albert', 'died', '1859', 'memory', 'was', 'so', 'alive', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'mourning', 'was', 'so', 'dramatic', 'virtually', 'retired', 'throne', 'Three', 'years', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'death', 'Queen', 'was', 'living', 'seclusion', 'Balmoral', 'Castle', 'Scotland', 'John', 'Brown', 'was', 'hired', 'tend', 'horses', 'rough', 'virile', 'man', 'far', 'more', 'accustomed', 'life', 'wild', 'royal', 'castles', 'Brown', 'treated', 'queen', 'respect', 'also', 'treated', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'refusing', 'obey', 'court', 'etiquette', 'encouraging', 'improve', 'health', 'spirits', 'riding', 'hills', 'time', 'came', 'be', 'confidante', 'so', 'much', 'royal', 'family', 'became', 'alarmed', 'relationship', 'members', 'Parliament', 'began', 'referring', 'mockingly', 'Mrs', 'Brown', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'wonderfully', 'sympathetic', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'haughty', 'who', 'try', 'control', 'angry', 'who', 'cross', 'vulnerable', 'someone', 'Brown', 'who', 'loneliness', 'determined', 'protect', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'perfect', 'John', 'Brown', 'rough', 'craggy-faced', 'full', 'life', 'unafraid', 'tell', 'queen', 'exactly', 'what', 'trait', 'queen', 'respect', 'Scenes', 'show', 'queen', 'reserve', 'slowly', 'responding', 'Brown', 'honesty', 'inherent', 'charm', 'was', 'affair', 'film', 'publicity', 'otherwise', 'depth', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'obvious.Filmed', 'location', 'Scottish', 'highlands', 'Duns', 'Castle', 'Scottish', 'Borders', '1998', 'production', 'wonderfully', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'everyday', 'royal', 'life', 'including', 'full', 'retinue', 'servants', 'ladies-in-waiting', 'queen', 'enormous', 'family', 'impatient', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'many', 'luminaries', 'history', 'especially', 'Benjamin', 'Disraeli', 'Antony', 'Sher', 'Lord', 'Henry', 'Ponsonby', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'whom', 'try', 'act', 'queen', 'best', 'interests', 'also', 'protecting', 'own', 'queen', 'responds', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'care', 'slow', 'subtle', 'effects', 'everyday', 'life', 'become', 'clear', 'viewer', 'remarkably', 'acted', 'scenes', 'Dench', 'Connolly', 'Dench', 'won', 'many', 'Best', 'Actress', 'awards', 'role', 'here', 'Connolly', 'was', 'nominated', 'almost', 'equal', 'number', 'role.A', 'gorgeous', 'costume', 'drama', 'large', 'cast', 'film', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'Dench', 'Connolly', 'whom', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'roles', 'everything', 'else', 'peripheral', 'n', 'Mary', 'Whipple']",Mrs. Brown VHS

She starts luaghing so he and his wife join in the uproar. It is what is left  unsaid that is most important in this film. The unspoken yet apparent love  between Queen Victoria and her highland servant Mr.Brown echoes that of  Emma Thompson an Anthony Hopkins in the 1993 masterpiece THE REMAINS OF THE  DAY. Mrs.Brown never quite reaches the heights of that classic because in  that film Anthony Hopkins lack of romantic involvment was more self imposed  then imposed by position and therefore gained a lrager measure of  poignancy. Mrs.Brown also doesn't have the poetic flow, or masterful  direction of that great film. Yet it is a terrific film in its own right,  elegantly (but conservatively) directed by John Madden, it gains much of  its power from three performances. The first is by Dame Judi Dench who as  the bruised monarch goes out of her way to ensure Mr.Brown position, her  immediate affection for him is gradually displayed in the film till it  reaches a peak in a very moving scene where she tell him &quot;Without you  I don't have the will to be what I must be&quot;, for that is the limit she  imposes on a display of affection. Billy Connely as Mr.Brown is a man who  shows his love in an obbsessive effort to protect his Queen and indeed  through the film he will offer considerable sacrifice to do just that. The  third wonderful performance is by an actor who plays prime minister  Diseraeli, whose name I don't know but the way in which he plays him  suggests smoothness and slyness to a biting fashion. There is also the  subtext of the uproar of the British political establishment and internal  politics among the rest of the servants , yet these events thankfully  remain in the background.

For lack of an official title, Mr. Brown would become a general factotum combining  a number of personal functions while in his queen's service.As this review will indicate there are problems with this movie. Dame Dench and Mr. Connolly present beautiful performances. Beautiful best describes the highland scenery and castle interiors, the attention to costuming and the general viewing experience of Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown. Hence the four stars.If you are a fan of the small movie, of costume drama based on history and/or British royalty you will want this movie; my concerns aside. Likely you will want to own this movie rather than rent or instant view it. I still cannot leave behind my questions.Having raised the issue of Mr. Brown's official title...  He had originally served as Prince Albert's ghillie, or Highland Scot for fishing guide and manservant.Because he had been trusted by Prince Albert, the widowed, grieving and no longer young Queen would admit him into the very small circle she allowed to attend her in her grief.  Over time their relationship would become close and constant as to cause a scandal. This scandal would also be a part of a constitutional crisis that would arise questioning the need for royalty given the queen's near total withdrawal from public affairs.  The relationship is the plot of this movie. The political issue its' back drop. The scandal is made mention and otherwise not important to the movie.Throughout her performance, Dame Dench moves across emotional states with her natural fluidity. She portrays a very self aware queen whose dignity will allow no presumption. Instantly she can call up the grief of Victoria and go straight into her role as the matriarch of an important family. Her performance is sufficient reward for selecting this move.Mr. Connolly's Mr. Brown is more of a puzzle. His acting is worth watching. I just do not get who Mr. Brown is, or what drove him or ...more on this to follow. Movie editing and the script never explain how he got past the queen's emotional armor. At first she is leery and her retainers closely observant. Then suddenly she is galloping over wild highland hillside. How did this happen?The CD jacket exclaims: ""Her forbidden passion!"" Except that this movie makes no case for or against the rumors. He is arrogant among the servants (his nominal peers), and physically handles a craven prince royal. How does he believe that these things are allowed? He is a gentle man, a drunkard and at the end a possible paranoid. Why does he think his Queens life is at risk?Virtual all of the rest of the cast serves as back drop. The politicians are all vaguely unpleasant (the queen's attitude toward Prime Minister Disraeli may have been coldly correct in her early years, but the evidence would suggest that she would come to respect him) The place courtiers are not folks with whom you would sequester yourself. The Royal family is portrayed as an undistinguished and interchangeable; hardly worth getting to know as individuals.The writing, directing and general flow of this movie argue for three stars, I don't hate these aspects, but they keep this from being a five-star gem.",4,Dame Judy Dench Delievers- majestic queen and vunerable woman,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,3374,"['character', 'driven', 'movie', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'Queen', 'England', 'icon', 'age', 'widowed', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'Dame', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'Mr', 'John', 'Brown', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'lack', 'official', 'title', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'would', 'become', 'general', 'factotum', 'combining', 'number', 'personal', 'functions', 'queen', 'service.As', 'review', 'will', 'indicate', 'are', 'problems', 'movie', 'Dame', 'Dench', 'Mr.', 'Connolly', 'present', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'Beautiful', 'best', 'highland', 'scenery', 'castle', 'interiors', 'attention', 'costuming', 'general', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'Hence', 'four', 'stars.If', 'are', 'fan', 'small', 'movie', 'costume', 'drama', 'based', 'history', 'and/or', 'British', 'royalty', 'will', 'want', 'movie', 'concerns', 'aside', 'Likely', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'movie', 'rather', 'rent', 'instant', 'view', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'questions.Having', 'raised', 'issue', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'official', 'title', 'had', 'originally', 'served', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'ghillie', 'Highland', 'Scot', 'fishing', 'guide', 'manservant.Because', 'had', 'been', 'trusted', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'widowed', 'grieving', 'longer', 'young', 'Queen', 'would', 'admit', 'very', 'small', 'circle', 'allowed', 'attend', 'grief', 'time', 'relationship', 'would', 'become', 'close', 'constant', 'cause', 'scandal', 'scandal', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'part', 'constitutional', 'crisis', 'would', 'arise', 'questioning', 'need', 'royalty', 'given', 'queen', 'total', 'withdrawal', 'public', 'affairs', 'relationship', 'plot', 'movie', 'political', 'issue', 'back', 'drop', 'scandal', 'made', 'mention', 'otherwise', 'not', 'important', 'movie.Throughout', 'performance', 'Dame', 'Dench', 'emotional', 'states', 'natural', 'fluidity', 'very', 'self', 'aware', 'queen', 'dignity', 'will', 'allow', 'presumption', 'Instantly', 'can', 'call', 'up', 'grief', 'Victoria', 'go', 'straight', 'role', 'matriarch', 'important', 'family', 'performance', 'sufficient', 'reward', 'selecting', 'move.Mr', 'Connolly', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'more', 'puzzle', 'acting', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'what', 'drove', 'more', 'follow', 'Movie', 'editing', 'script', 'never', 'explain', 'how', 'got', 'queen', 'emotional', 'armor', 'first', 'leery', 'retainers', 'closely', 'observant', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'galloping', 'wild', 'highland', 'hillside', 'How', 'did', 'happen', 'CD', 'jacket', 'forbidden', 'passion', 'movie', 'case', 'rumors', 'arrogant', 'servants', 'nominal', 'peers', 'physically', 'craven', 'prince', 'royal', 'How', 'believe', 'things', 'are', 'allowed', 'gentle', 'man', 'drunkard', 'end', 'possible', 'paranoid', 'Why', 'think', 'Queens', 'life', 'risk', 'Virtual', 'rest', 'cast', 'back', 'drop', 'politicians', 'are', 'vaguely', 'unpleasant', 'queen', 'attitude', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Disraeli', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'coldly', 'correct', 'early', 'years', 'evidence', 'would', 'suggest', 'would', 'come', 'respect', 'place', 'courtiers', 'are', 'not', 'folks', 'whom', 'would', 'sequester', 'Royal', 'family', 'portrayed', 'undistinguished', 'interchangeable', 'hardly', 'getting', 'know', 'individuals.The', 'writing', 'directing', 'general', 'flow', 'movie', 'argue', 'three', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'aspects', 'keep', 'being', 'five-star', 'gem']",Mrs. Brown VHS

No one can get her out of her mourning.Because her husband was so fond of him, Victoria sends for John Brown (Billy Connolly), a Scotsman who was one of her husband's attendants. Being a stubborn Scot, he doesn't take 'no' for an answer and waits out in the courtyard until Her Majesty finally decides to go out on a pony ride. Gradually, they develop a friendship--or is it more? That's a question asked by historians and fans of the royal family throughout the years.Meanwhile, there's a political struggle going on.  The Prime Minister (Antony Sher) wants the Queen back in the reins. Bertie, the Prince of wales, (David Westhead) is anxious to take the reins from his Mum. Meanwhile, the rumors about the Queen and Brown are flying and as one pol says to another: ""This country runs by talk...""There's a lot of speculation both in the film and out about the relationship between Queen Victoria and John Brown.  She was a favorite of mine and I honestly hope she did have some comfort after her husband's death.Whatever the film is historically, it's an amazing costume drama from both what the characters wear and the landscape behind them. Dench and Connolly do a superlative job in their respective roles. Dame Judi has played two of Great Britain's queens to date and she's quite regal in both.I've seen this film several times and every time I note something different.

Unfortunately, for me this film did not equal the hype of the editorial synopsis and raves by many amazon.com reviewers.  I was greatly disappointed with ""Mrs. Brown"".One of the underlying problems seemed to be in a lack of first-hand knowledge of the complex interpersonal relationship between Victoria and Mr. Brown and a very limited amount of time to develop the characters and their relationship. The script-writing, casting of the major roles (including Judi Dench and Billy Connolly), the directing and the film-editing were problematic for me.An exception to my disappointment in the casting was Antony Sher as Prime Minister Disraeli; he gave a very convincing portrayal of the pragmatic politician and really looked like the character he was portraying.  The very fine actors, Judi Dench and Billy Connolly, were miscast and I really didn't see portrayal of ""passion"" between the mature Victoria and the commoner due to the script and directing rather than the actors in their roles.  For me it was similar to seeing a famous opera singer in a role twenty years junior to the actual age of the singer.  Gerard Butler, a favorite of mine since the Phantom of the Opera movie, gave a convincing portrayal but looked realistically more like Billy Connolly's son than a younger brother. Victoria was supposedly in her mid- to late-40s when the story began---it might have been better if the story could have been Queen Victoria remembering her relationship with Mr. Brown twenty years later.The script seemed to have been written from information available in the public domain rather than biographical information from people intimately acquainted with Queen Victoria and her private feelings.  There was not a gradual unfolding of the relationship and the story simply did not hang together cohesively.  Victoria and Brown did not seem real and I never felt we were getting to know the characters as living people.The BBC usually does better in British period dramas than this particular film.",3,A Masterpiece Theatre disappointment,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,2133,"['long-time', 'fan', 'British', 'period', 'drama', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'was', 'really', 'excited', '2011', 'DVD', '1997', 'production', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'equal', 'hype', 'editorial', 'synopsis', 'raves', 'many', 'amazon.com', 'reviewers', 'was', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', '.One', 'underlying', 'problems', 'seemed', 'be', 'lack', 'first-hand', 'knowledge', 'complex', 'interpersonal', 'relationship', 'Victoria', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'very', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'relationship', 'script-writing', 'casting', 'major', 'roles', 'including', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'directing', 'film-editing', 'were', 'problematic', 'me.An', 'exception', 'disappointment', 'casting', 'was', 'Antony', 'Sher', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Disraeli', 'gave', 'very', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'pragmatic', 'politician', 'really', 'looked', 'character', 'was', 'portraying', 'very', 'fine', 'actors', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'were', 'miscast', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'portrayal', 'passion', 'mature', 'Victoria', 'commoner', 'due', 'script', 'directing', 'rather', 'actors', 'roles', 'was', 'similar', 'seeing', 'famous', 'opera', 'singer', 'role', 'twenty', 'years', 'junior', 'actual', 'age', 'singer', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'movie', 'gave', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'looked', 'realistically', 'more', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'son', 'younger', 'brother', 'Victoria', 'was', 'supposedly', 'mid-', 'late-40s', 'when', 'story', 'began', '-it', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'remembering', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'twenty', 'years', 'later.The', 'script', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'information', 'available', 'public', 'domain', 'rather', 'biographical', 'information', 'people', 'intimately', 'acquainted', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'private', 'feelings', 'was', 'not', 'gradual', 'unfolding', 'relationship', 'story', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'hang', 'together', 'cohesively', 'Victoria', 'Brown', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'real', 'never', 'felt', 'were', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'living', 'people.The', 'BBC', 'usually', 'better', 'British', 'period', 'dramas', 'particular', 'film']",Mrs. Brown VHS
