1328562,A2BZL35CIYJWMG,B0036TGSR6,acwrite,"[3, 4]","This movie has a lot of positive points to it that made it worth watching.  First, the acting was well done.  Pierce Brosnan, Kim Cattrall, Ewan McGregor, and Olivia Williams play characters who are complex, mysterious, and delightfully hard to predict.  Secondly, the ambiance of the film is spot-on.  The bleak atmosphere is foreboding and unsettling with its stark cinematography and the feeling like your every move is being watched from the opening scene.  Lastly, the plot is full of murky twists and turns that keep you guessing what will happen through the very last scene.  Add all of these things together and you end up with a movie that makes you feel nervous, uncomfortable, and agitated - just like a good political thriller should.The story begins when a ghost writer, hired to write the memoirs for a former British Prime Minister, washes up dead on the shores of Martha's Vineyard.  Things only get more dangerous and bizarre when a second ghost writer is hired to finish the job and finds a trail of strange clues that his predecessor left behind. What's eventually uncovered is an intricate plot involving murder, terrorism, and the CIA.I found this ominous and understated political thriller to be definitely worth watching.

This would be a great movie to see while Tony Blair is running around the U.S. pushing sales of his just released memoirs. The movie is fiction of course but it draws on recent headlines involving Great Britain and its ties to the U.S. but more specifically the British PM and his ties to George W. Bush, and the runup to the Iraq war. That is the backdrop of the movie but it is really a story about average people getting caught up in extraordinary events. As others have said this is a movie that Hitchcock could have made. Think ""Foreign Correspondent, North By Northwest, or The Man Who Knew Too Much"". It helps that the movie was based on a well written book by Robert Harris, a first rate author of popular fiction, who collaborated with Roman Polanski in developing the screen play.

1328568,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B0036TGSR6,Amit Talpade,"[2, 4]","Generally I avoid movies that are about the war in Iraq, simply because there have been so many. I only watched this because it has been directed by Roman Polanski, who delivers great movies. The Ghost Writer is about a author (Evan McGregor ) who has been picked to ghost write for Adam Lang ( Pierce Brosnan ) a former British Prime Minister. The circumstances under which McGregor was picked were tragic and mysterious because the prior ghost writer died. As he commences his ghost writing duties, he starts discovering some chilling revelations.I thought the movie was excellent in all respects, especially the writing, acting and direction. The movie takes place in the confines of Martha's Vineyard and some other locations. The entire mood of the movie is somber and gloomy and something always seems to be simmering under the surface. Each character has been brilliantly written and suspicious. The conclusion is also surprising and chilling. Based on a book, The Ghost by Robert Harris, the references draw parallels to Tony Blair. There is also a Condi Rice lookalike in one scene. Kim Cattrall acts reserved a complete change from the loud role she has had on the Sex and the City series. Olivia Williams is splendid as the frustrated but in control wife of the Prime Minister. Evan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan are great and so is Tom Wilkinson in a brief but important role.

1328569,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0036TGSR6,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Apparently, when Roman Polanski isn't accosting young girls he is making really good movies.  Ok, so I've know that for a while (I mean, this is the man behind `Chinatown' and `Rosemary's Baby') but it's always nice to be reminded of Polanski's sharp eye for detail.Watching `The Ghost Writer' made me realize that `Sherlock Holmes' could have used Polanski's restraint.The film revolves around an unnamed ghostwriter who gets landed the job of rewriting the memoirs of British Prime Minister Adam Lang after the previous ghost was found dead (apparent suicide).  Shortly after landing the job, the ghost finds himself in over his head when Adam is accused of war crimes and things around him start to become increasingly chaotic.  As the ghost struggles to make something intriguing and meaningful out of the bore-fest that is this memoir he realizes that finding the truth behind the faade is surely going to bring him close to death.Or maybe it will bring him death.The film certainly has its fair share of twists and turns, most of which are actually probable (which aids in making this experience truly chilling).  I did figure out the ending before it was revealed, which was a little let-down for me since I was convinced by close friends that it was a total shocker (but maybe that's what gave it away...I was looking for it).  That said, it was satisfying, especially the way it is revealed (like I said, `Sherlock Holmes' should have had this detailed understanding).The biggest asset this film has is the acting here.  I've always loved Ewan McGregor, the man with the greatest hair in Hollywood (seriously, no matter how much product I use I can never attain his perfect balance of chaotic control), and it's nice to see him working a juicy role with such nuanced understanding.  I was surprised to see Kim Cattrall tackling something so far removed from what she's famous for.  She should do this more often.  Olivia Williams is effortless here, completely convincing from start to finish and I am in love with Tom Wilkinson and firmly believe he should be in EVERY film, so seeing him show up near the films conclusion really made my night.  Honestly though, this film was all about Pierce Bronsan for me.  I've always liked him, but I've never loved him.  He has excited me with his performances before (most notably in `The Matador', where he really deserved an Oscar nomination) and this is one where he walked away most memorable.  His feverish performance has the right balance needed to create a character you understand almost more than he understands himself.  Most notable was the private jet scene with McGregor.  Watch his face, listen to his tone, and realize that he is telling you everything you need to know even though he doesn't fully understand what he is relaying to you.Stunning.The film is a solid thriller.  It isn't perfect, but Polanski is a refined and perfected director who knows how to create a memorable and meaningful film; time and time again.",4,Effectively chilling despite being a tad predictable...,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,2988,"['Apparently', 'when', 'Roman', 'Polanski', ""n't"", 'accosting', 'young', 'girls', 'making', 'really', 'good', 'movies', 'Ok', 'so', ""'ve"", 'know', 'while', 'mean', 'man', 'Chinatown', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'always', 'nice', 'be', 'reminded', 'Polanski', 'sharp', 'eye', 'detail.Watching', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'made', 'realize', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'Polanski', 'restraint.The', 'film', 'unnamed', 'ghostwriter', 'who', 'landed', 'job', 'rewriting', 'memoirs', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'previous', 'ghost', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'Shortly', 'landing', 'job', 'ghost', 'head', 'when', 'Adam', 'accused', 'war', 'crimes', 'things', 'start', 'become', 'increasingly', 'chaotic', 'ghost', 'make', 'something', 'intriguing', 'meaningful', 'bore-fest', 'memoir', 'finding', 'truth', 'faade', 'surely', 'going', 'bring', 'close', 'death.Or', 'maybe', 'will', 'bring', 'death.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'fair', 'share', 'twists', 'turns', 'most', 'are', 'actually', 'probable', 'making', 'experience', 'truly', 'chilling', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'ending', 'was', 'revealed', 'was', 'little', 'let-down', 'was', 'convinced', 'close', 'friends', 'was', 'total', 'shocker', 'maybe', 'what', 'gave', 'away', 'was', 'looking', 'said', 'was', 'satisfying', 'especially', 'way', 'revealed', 'said', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'detailed', 'understanding', 'biggest', 'asset', 'film', 'acting', 'here', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'man', 'greatest', 'hair', 'Hollywood', 'seriously', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'product', 'use', 'can', 'never', 'attain', 'perfect', 'balance', 'chaotic', 'control', 'nice', 'see', 'working', 'juicy', 'role', 'such', 'nuanced', 'understanding', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'tackling', 'something', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'what', 'famous', 'should', 'do', 'more', 'often', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'effortless', 'here', 'completely', 'convincing', 'start', 'finish', 'am', 'love', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'firmly', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'EVERY', 'film', 'so', 'seeing', 'show', 'up', 'films', 'conclusion', 'really', 'made', 'night', 'Honestly', 'film', 'was', 'Pierce', 'Bronsan', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', ""'ve"", 'never', 'loved', 'excited', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'Matador', 'where', 'really', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'one', 'where', 'walked', 'away', 'most', 'memorable', 'feverish', 'performance', 'right', 'balance', 'needed', 'create', 'character', 'understand', 'almost', 'more', 'Most', 'notable', 'was', 'private', 'jet', 'scene', 'McGregor', 'Watch', 'face', 'listen', 'tone', 'realize', 'telling', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'even', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'relaying', 'you.Stunning.The', 'film', 'solid', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Polanski', 'refined', 'perfected', 'director', 'who', 'how', 'create', 'memorable', 'meaningful', 'film', 'time', 'time', 'again']",N/A
1328570,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0036TGSR6,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed Roman Polanski's adaptation of Robert Harris' novel The Ghost: A Novel (HARDCOVER), renamed 'The Ghost Writer' for US release.  The movie, too, takes the name of the US book release.  Shame that, because 'The Ghost' is a more apt title - Harris' trick is to never provide a name to the Ewan McGregor writer character...a feat Polanski pulls off as well.  The Ghost role was originally supposed to go to Nicolas Cage, but passed to McGregor.  That was a major upgrade - Cage has become a cartoon.  Harris' protagonist is short on ego and confidence and has a bit of marketing and Fleet Street in him.  McGregor is perfect.Harris' book is a thinly veiled broadside at Tony Blair.  Harris had been a supporter of Blair's, but soured on him over Iraq.  Here's where the movie excels over the book: Pierce Brosnan's Adam Lang is positively Blair-ian down to his fiber.  No less subtle is Harris' depiction of Lang's wife, Ruth, as shrewish and scheming (and more), pretty much hitting and playing up the worst rumors of Cherie Blair's behind-the-scenes role at 10 Downing St.  The Blairs can't be at all happy with this portrayal, most notably with Harris' denouement as it comes to the Adam Lang character.  And, if anything, Polanski's version is even more shocking as it comes to its treatment of Lang in the end.  It seems almost incendiary.I enjoyed the film a bit less than the book.  The book's tone is superb.  I was hooked right from the first line - ""The moment I heard how McAra died, I should have walked away.""  That's one of the best opening lines ever for a novel.  I have to admit I was fairly obsessed with cataloging the differences between book and film, mostly those due to what I'll call ""Polanski-induced restrictions.""  The book takes place mostly in three locales: London; Martha's Vineyard and New York City.  Polanski can travel to none of those places.  So, Berlin serves as London.  A bleak island in the North Sea serves as gray, wintertime Martha's Vineyard.  And Harris and Polanski - as adapters of the novel into a screenplay - conspire to write NYC out of the plot all together.",4,"Enjoyable adaptation of Robert Harris' excellent novel, but I was distracted by Polanski-induced plot restrictions",1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,2117,"['enjoyed', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'adaptation', 'Robert', 'Harris', 'novel', 'Ghost', 'Novel', 'HARDCOVER', 'renamed', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'US', 'release', 'movie', 'too', 'name', 'US', 'book', 'release', 'Shame', ""'The"", 'Ghost', 'more', 'apt', 'title', 'Harris', 'trick', 'never', 'provide', 'name', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'writer', 'character', 'feat', 'Polanski', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'Ghost', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'go', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'passed', 'McGregor', 'was', 'major', 'upgrade', 'Cage', 'become', 'cartoon', 'Harris', 'protagonist', 'short', 'ego', 'confidence', 'bit', 'marketing', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'McGregor', 'perfect.Harris', 'book', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'broadside', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Harris', 'had', 'been', 'supporter', 'Blair', 'soured', 'over', 'Iraq', 'Here', 'where', 'movie', 'book', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'positively', 'Blair-ian', 'down', 'fiber', 'less', 'subtle', 'Harris', 'depiction', 'Lang', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'shrewish', 'scheming', 'more', 'pretty', 'much', 'hitting', 'playing', 'up', 'worst', 'rumors', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'behind-the-scenes', 'role', '10', 'Downing', 'St', 'Blairs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'portrayal', 'most', 'notably', 'Harris', 'denouement', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'character', 'anything', 'Polanski', 'version', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'treatment', 'Lang', 'end', 'almost', 'incendiary.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'bit', 'less', 'book', 'book', 'tone', 'superb', 'was', 'hooked', 'right', 'first', 'line', 'moment', 'heard', 'how', 'McAra', 'died', 'should', 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'one', 'best', 'opening', 'lines', 'ever', 'novel', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'fairly', 'obsessed', 'cataloging', 'differences', 'book', 'film', 'mostly', 'due', 'what', ""'ll"", 'call', 'Polanski-induced', 'restrictions', 'book', 'place', 'mostly', 'three', 'locales', 'London', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Polanski', 'can', 'travel', 'none', 'places', 'So', 'Berlin', 'London', 'A', 'bleak', 'island', 'North', 'Sea', 'gray', 'wintertime', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'Harris', 'Polanski', 'adapters', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'conspire', 'write', 'NYC', 'plot', 'together']",N/A

The controversy surrounding Polanski will dominate the argument. I feel that is incredibly unfair to every one else who has worked on this movie. So I am going to separate the art from the artist.In what has to be one of the best casting decisions, Pierce Brosnan plays Adam Lang the former Prime Minister of UK. Embroiled in a controversy regarding the rendition program, he has sought refuge in America. Ewan McGregor (he is never given a name) is hired as a ghost writer after the original one dies in a mysterious accident.Your average thriller would start out with the base setup and build on the tension leading upto the finale. But in Ghost Writer the tension is always palpable. Even in the most mundane of scenes you are never allowed to settle. The remarkable background score by Alexandre Desplat and the camera work of Pawel Edelman which paints predominantly in varying shades of bleakness play a huge part in achieving that.Pierce Brosnan is brilliant as a conflicted man who had to make difficult decisions in demanding situations. The movie very wisely chooses not take a stance on where it stands on those decisions. Olivia Williams as Ruth Lang produces an impressive multi-faceted performance in a meaty role - the kind rare in Hollywood these days.So if you are open to separating the art from the artist, definitely watch this movie.",4,Art and the Artist,1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,1423,"['movie', 'bound', 'raise', 'ire', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'Polanski', 'will', 'dominate', 'argument', 'feel', 'incredibly', 'unfair', 'one', 'else', 'who', 'worked', 'movie', 'So', 'am', 'going', 'separate', 'art', 'artist.In', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'casting', 'decisions', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'former', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'UK', 'Embroiled', 'controversy', 'regarding', 'rendition', 'program', 'sought', 'refuge', 'America', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'never', 'given', 'name', 'hired', 'ghost', 'writer', 'original', 'one', 'mysterious', 'accident.Your', 'average', 'thriller', 'would', 'start', 'out', 'base', 'setup', 'build', 'tension', 'leading', 'finale', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'tension', 'always', 'palpable', 'Even', 'most', 'mundane', 'scenes', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'settle', 'remarkable', 'background', 'score', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'camera', 'work', 'Pawel', 'Edelman', 'predominantly', 'varying', 'shades', 'bleakness', 'play', 'huge', 'part', 'achieving', 'that.Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'brilliant', 'conflicted', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'make', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'demanding', 'situations', 'movie', 'very', 'wisely', 'not', 'take', 'stance', 'where', 'decisions', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Ruth', 'Lang', 'impressive', 'multi-faceted', 'performance', 'meaty', 'role', 'kind', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'days.So', 'are', 'open', 'separating', 'art', 'artist', 'definitely', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

He may not be an invective reporter but he is too nosy to let it go. What he cannot let go of could very well mean his life. Then again, maybe it will all work out for the best.

He has an elegant gift of being able to take a thriller and jam pack it to the brim with as much drama as he can, without making it boring. I look at his films sometimes and wonder how he does it. Chinatown, The Pianist and The Ninth Gate, are among his best pictures, and are now followed by The Ghost Writer.Ewan McGregor stars as `The Ghost' - a writer who is good at what he does, but doesn't have much to be proud of in his life. McGregor is amazing. The guy has the ability to take a character that we would normally look at like a joke or a dork, and make us not only like him, but love him by the end of the movie. The Men Who Stare at Goats displays this beautifully.His Ghost character here, is the same. There is nothing big and cinematic about him that would ordinarily warrant him to be a lead character. In fact, had McGregor not been cast to play him, I'm not sure the film would have worked.We follow The Ghost from start to finish. He's invited to a meeting at which he is offered a very large sum of money to act as a ghost writer for a well known politician named Lang (Pierce Brosnan).  Lang has been working on his autobiography with another ghost writer, who has just turned up dead; dun, Dun, DUN!Something shady is going on with Lang and soon The Ghost grows suspicious of this and decides to do some snooping around. Was this guy involved in the mysterious death of his previous ghost? And will our ghost be next?As was the case in Salt and a ton of other movies, there are undoubtedly themes and tones in The Ghost Writer that can shadow current day political scandals; but that doesn't interest me. Who cares? We go to the movies to be entertained with fiction, not political nonsense. So, sorry - we won't be discussing that today; but the news is on at six.The story is very riveting and grasps your attention right away and this is where Polanski shines the most: telling the story with the camera. As best I can remember, we never knew anything that The Ghost didn't. That's good suspense.Lots of clues, lots of twists, love affairs, lying, brilliant writing and directing, great acting by everyone all around and a brilliant story, all wrapped up with one of the best endings I've seen in a while.

1328592,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0036TGSR6,DanD,"[2, 4]","It's been a while since Polanski has directed a straight-up thriller; THE PIANIST was a superb drama, but it hasn't been since THE NINTH GATE over a decade ago that we've had something taut and suspenseful.  And while THE GHOST WRITER isn't Polanski's best, or even his most suspenseful, it is indeed a superb film that resonates in today's culture.The film follows a ghost writer (Ewen McGregor) as he is hired to write the memoirs of former Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan).  After ensconcing himself in Lang's American retreat, and getting to know Lang's loyal secretary (Kim Cattrall) and wife (Olivia Williams), the Ghost (and the world) discover that Lang is being charged with war crimes.  Are they true?  And what exactly happened to Lang's previous ghost writer, who washed ashore a couple weeks ago?What could easily have been a throw-away political thriller is, in the hands of Planski and novelist/screenwriter Robert Harris, a personal thriller.  Politics are clearly important here (there's no denying this is a Tony Blair allegory), but it's really about the Ghost; and as such, McGregor is forced to carry a lot of this film on his thankfully-capable shoulders.  He turns in a fine performance, one of his best.  Brosnan is surprisingly underused; ever since he cast aside the Bond tux, he's been turning out marvelous performances left and right.  Here's yet another, in the brief screen time he's given.  Cattrall is appropriately menacing; is she merely loyal, or something much worse?  And Olivia Williams is a stunner; her chemistry with McGregor doesn't quite click, but she is in fine-form, turning in a sultry, mysterious performance.The film never entirely digs itself in.  Much as with Polanski's 80s thriller FRANTIC, we never get a real sense of the danger, despite the stellar script, direction, and performances; thus, the ending, while otherwise inevitable (and yet oddly satisfying), comes off as a bit hackneyed.  There's a claustrophobia that just isn't here; we don't feel the Ghost's world closing in upon him.  Still, THE GHOST WRITER is a great thriller from a fantastic director and writer.  It's not Polanski's best, but it's better than a lot of the political thriller wannabes out there.",4,"A taut, well-acted thriller.",1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,2238,"['been', 'while', 'Polanski', 'directed', 'straight-up', 'thriller', 'THE', 'PIANIST', 'was', 'superb', 'drama', ""n't"", 'been', 'THE', 'NINTH', 'GATE', 'decade', ""'ve"", 'had', 'something', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'THE', 'GHOST', 'WRITER', ""n't"", 'Polanski', 'best', 'even', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'indeed', 'superb', 'film', 'today', 'culture.The', 'film', 'ghost', 'writer', 'Ewen', 'McGregor', 'hired', 'write', 'memoirs', 'former', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'ensconcing', 'Lang', 'American', 'retreat', 'getting', 'know', 'Lang', 'loyal', 'secretary', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'wife', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Ghost', 'world', 'discover', 'Lang', 'being', 'charged', 'war', 'crimes', 'Are', 'true', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'Lang', 'previous', 'ghost', 'writer', 'who', 'washed', 'ashore', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'What', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'throw-away', 'political', 'thriller', 'hands', 'Planski', 'novelist/screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Harris', 'personal', 'thriller', 'Politics', 'are', 'clearly', 'important', 'here', 'denying', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'allegory', 'really', 'Ghost', 'such', 'McGregor', 'forced', 'carry', 'lot', 'film', 'thankfully-capable', 'shoulders', 'fine', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'Brosnan', 'surprisingly', 'underused', 'ever', 'cast', 'aside', 'Bond', 'tux', 'been', 'turning', 'out', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'left', 'right', 'Here', 'yet', 'brief', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Cattrall', 'appropriately', 'menacing', 'merely', 'loyal', 'something', 'much', 'worse', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'stunner', 'chemistry', 'McGregor', ""n't"", 'quite', 'click', 'fine-form', 'turning', 'sultry', 'mysterious', 'performance.The', 'film', 'never', 'entirely', 'Much', 'Polanski', '80s', 'thriller', 'FRANTIC', 'never', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'danger', 'stellar', 'script', 'direction', 'performances', 'thus', 'ending', 'otherwise', 'inevitable', 'yet', 'oddly', 'satisfying', 'off', 'bit', 'hackneyed', 'claustrophobia', 'just', ""n't"", 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Ghost', 'world', 'closing', 'Still', 'GHOST', 'WRITER', 'great', 'thriller', 'fantastic', 'director', 'writer', 'not', 'Polanski', 'best', 'better', 'lot', 'political', 'thriller', 'out', 'there']",N/A

The director, Roman Polanski, has lost his edge, and mostly phoned in this effort.The Ghost Writer is a who done it mystery set within hypothetical recent political events. The mystery is not complex, and once resolution sets in at the end, there really isn't much of a surprise. Nick (Ewan McGregor) is hired to ghost write Adam Lang's (Pierce Brosnan) memoir, the previous ghost writer turned up dead.This film is well worth watching for the performances by Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan. McGregor is a quiet, polite, subdued Englishman that is just smart enough and just curious enough. Brosnan lost all his put on style from Remington Steele, and James Bond days; and he is thankfully no longer the pig from The Matador. He plays a former Prime Minister that was elected to represent every man. Brosnan has just enough class and crass to pull this role off. Polanski extracted wonderful performances out of both men.James Belushi is a huge surprise in this film, with a very short appearance as a bald publisher. The transformation from his previous roles is incredible. I hardly recognized Kim Cattrall as Amelia, Adam Lang's secretary. She had a demure sternness and sensuality, a far cry from the Sex in the City role she has come to play in almost every movie. The rest of the supporting cast was very good.The problem with this film is Polanski. This was mostly a standard pot boiler film. There was nothing cutting edge, revolutionary, or evolutionary about the film. The photography and editing were straight melodrama. The only interesting part of the film was his subtle manipulation of the bookends - the first and last five minutes of the film. It is worthwhile to watch the very beginning of the film just after watching the whole film. Polanski has done so many incredible things for film. This film is not one of them.The film is rated PG-13, there is a little strong language, some references to torture, a brief scene of somebody being water boarded, and a brief view of Ewan McGregor's behind as he gets into bed. It seems this film is rated about right and is probably a bit too mature for children under thirteen years old.This was a good movie.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","Yes, yes, yes, we all know that Bush & Blair are war criminals, that the film industry has a leftist political agenda, and that Roman Polanski is a scoundrel.  Now that we've got the obvious out of the way you'll enjoy Polanski's clever thriller THE GHOST WRITER--a film with several twists and turns, some of them predictable, some of them not so predictable.  What totally delighted and surprised me were the performances of Pierce Brosnan as former Prime Minister Adam Lang and Ewan McGregor as the ghost writer assigned to help Lang pen his memoirs; I must confess I'm not much of a fan of either actor, but here Polanski brings out these guys' A games, with Brosnan as a petulant politician accused of war crimes, McGregor as a hack writer suddenly in way over his head.THE GHOST WRITER takes place primarily on a cold, windswept, and dreary island off of Martha's Vineyard, where Lang has established his own secure compound.  (Of course, we all know this isn't really Martha's Vineyard being filmed, as Polanski won't set foot in the States, which adds to my amusement, but I digress.)  The miserable conditions outside set the somber and surreal tone for the film, as McGregor's unnamed character starts to uncover the ugly truth about the ex-PM--which inevitably leads to personal danger for the ghost writer.  Throw in an affair with Lang's wife (a stimulating Olivia Williams) and now we've got a complex and multi-layered plot, culminating in an ending that had me envious of its cleverness.To be sure, THE GHOST WRITER meanders, and the google epiphany is just silly, but overall this is a taut, satisfying political thriller.  Kudos to Kim Cattrall, sporting an unreliabel Brit accent, as Lang's personal assistant.  Watching her I kept asking myself, ""Is this the 'Sex In the City' MILF?""  To which I answered (as I talk to myself alot), ""Can't be.  Performance is too solid.""  Cattrall is cultivated and uber sensuous, which further enhances this fun film.

1328602,A14GFBX4V1Y79W,B0036TGSR6,Donald Gavron,"[3, 5]","Whatever on thinks about Roman Polanski the man certainly knows how to make compelling films. Since ""Knife in the Water"" (in 1962) he has been giving viewers psychological horror films that remain among the best of all time. In ""The Ghost Writer,"" Polanski shifts his aim at a more subtle horror -- the criminal activities of world leaders that hide behind their so-called patriotism. There are a lot of allusions in this film, some obvious (to Tony Blair, ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain) and some ironic (Adam Lang, the ex-PM, is sequestered in a hideaway that suggest Polanski's own recent incarceration in his Swiss Chalet while under house arrest in Switzerland). The thrust of the story is a memoir Lang is writing. The first ghostwriter he employs dies under mysterious circumstances (Suicide? Murder?) and another, unnamed writer (wonderfully played by Ewan McGregor) is employed to touch up the script. Soon accusations surface regarding Lang's involvement with the CIA. The ""Ghost"" is now under fire to complete the heavy-handed ms. sooner than expected to capitalize on the recent events. The manuscript becomes the focal point of the film. The Ghost's room is ransacked. Lang's subordinates are not quite what they seem (even his wife falls under suspicion), and there are telling clues in the ms. and research of the former ghost that suggest Lang is guilty of the crimes he so vehemently denies. Without revealing much more of the plot, the film follows the Ghost on his mission to find the truth. But the truth has a cost, and what is the truth anyway? Polanski seems to be asking these questions of himself in addition to the actions of the leaders who spin the truth for their own expediency. Pierce Brosnan must be acknowledged as a fine choice for Lang. His performance is one of his best. Olivia Williams, Tom Wilkinson and 95-year old Eli Wallach, who is a treasure to behold, deliver other delicious acting turns. There are holes in the script (let the viewer find them) and some stilted performances (Kim Cattrall and Timothy Hutton don't seem to fit), but Polanski weaves his spider's web of deceit and betrayal like few directors can or could. This is an exercise in style and paranoia, and a pointed examination of the people who shape political events.",5,A Political Thriller That Delivers,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2282,"['thinks', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'man', 'certainly', 'how', 'make', 'compelling', 'films', 'Knife', 'Water', '1962', 'been', 'giving', 'viewers', 'psychological', 'horror', 'films', 'remain', 'best', 'time', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'Polanski', 'shifts', 'aim', 'more', 'subtle', 'horror', 'criminal', 'activities', 'world', 'leaders', 'hide', 'so-called', 'patriotism', 'are', 'lot', 'allusions', 'film', 'obvious', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'ex-Prime', 'Minister', 'Great', 'Britain', 'ironic', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'ex-PM', 'sequestered', 'hideaway', 'suggest', 'Polanski', 'own', 'recent', 'incarceration', 'Swiss', 'Chalet', 'house', 'arrest', 'Switzerland', 'thrust', 'story', 'memoir', 'Lang', 'writing', 'first', 'ghostwriter', 'dies', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Suicide', 'Murder', 'unnamed', 'writer', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'employed', 'touch', 'up', 'script', 'Soon', 'accusations', 'surface', 'regarding', 'Lang', 'involvement', 'CIA', 'Ghost', 'now', 'fire', 'complete', 'heavy-handed', 'ms.', 'sooner', 'expected', 'capitalize', 'recent', 'events', 'manuscript', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'Ghost', 'room', 'ransacked', 'Lang', 'subordinates', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'seem', 'even', 'wife', 'suspicion', 'are', 'telling', 'clues', 'ms.', 'research', 'former', 'ghost', 'suggest', 'Lang', 'guilty', 'crimes', 'so', 'vehemently', 'revealing', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'film', 'Ghost', 'mission', 'find', 'truth', 'truth', 'cost', 'what', 'truth', 'anyway', 'Polanski', 'be', 'asking', 'questions', 'addition', 'actions', 'leaders', 'who', 'spin', 'truth', 'own', 'expediency', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'must', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'fine', 'choice', 'Lang', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', '95-year', 'old', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'who', 'treasure', 'behold', 'deliver', 'other', 'delicious', 'acting', 'turns', 'are', 'holes', 'script', 'let', 'viewer', 'find', 'stilted', 'performances', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'Polanski', 'spider', 'web', 'deceit', 'betrayal', 'few', 'directors', 'can', 'could', 'exercise', 'style', 'paranoia', 'pointed', 'examination', 'people', 'who', 'shape', 'political', 'events']",N/A
1328603,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B0036TGSR6,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[13, 28]","I have been disappointed by the endings of many movies, felt cheated/betrayed or insulted by some, and been irritated that the filmmaker wasted my time. However, I cannot remember ever being as infuriated by an ending as this one.  There were five elements in that ending that each would have themselves constituted a ridiculous or otherwise bad ending.WARNING: Some of the comments on this review contain spoilers--additional absurdities that I omitted or danced around here.The cinematography and atmospherics are very good (with caveats), as one would expect from this director (Polanski), and if I had known to shutdown my brain and not try to follow the story, I probably would have enjoyed the first half to two-thirds of the movie.  However, the story is one long stream of ridiculous contrivances and contradictions, all the way from the core plot elements (examples below) down to the minor details. It feels like the author/scriptwriter (Harris) took the template of the suspense thriller and shoved a grab-bag of standard elements from the genre into the slots without bothering to make them even moderately compatible, much less a coherent story.  I am not talking about the normal contrivances that power the typical suspense thriller or even the over-the-top contrivances that provide the energy to ones like The Da Vinci Code.  I am talking ones that are unnecessary, lazy/stupid and blatant (""In your face"").The scriptwriter even fails to provide consistency between adjacent sentences in a scene. The replacement ghost writer played by Ewan McGregor (henceforth GW2) is attempting to set up a meeting and is concerned about his telephone call being monitored by the bad guys.  The other party tells him to be vague about his location, he agrees and then gives not just the name of his hotel, but his room number (even though they aren't meeting at his room).A number of these plugged-in elements are blatant anachronisms.  Having a few such is acceptable, but their number and avoidability add to the sense that the scriptwriter wasn't really trying. For example, when leaving one house, GW2 is told to not turn in the wrong direction or he could become fatally lost. This is said menacingly, but comes off as silly: GW2 is driving a luxury SUV--in which GPS has long been standard--and the audience is well aware of the GPS because GW2 had depended on it to get to the house, plus the product placement includes the SUV's computer reminding the driver of this fact every time he gets in.If you are familiar with New England, some of the atmospherics may be spoiled because the sense-of-place is wrong.  The primary locale is a beach house on an unnamed large island (think Martha's Vineyard) in winter, and the weather is primarily high overcast, lacking the dynamic aspects and extremes that I remember. And when GW2 visits a person's house ""in Boston"", that house is in a thinly populated, thickly forested rural/wilderness area where you can drive for miles without seeing another vehicle.  My recollections of Boston are quite different: that leaving a gap of more than half a car's length was an open invitation for another car to pull in front of you.  Also, the scenes involving the ferry are decidedly and jarringly non-American.The atmospherics of the beach house, although artistically interesting, don't support the suspense thriller story.  It provides a sense of isolation, but one that you seek out rather than endure, and that is expansive rather than claustrophobic.In its promising start, the movie _touches_ on--but fails to develop--a number of themes that could have been interesting in a suspense thriller not centered on a murder and this category of The Big Secret.Additional caveats: Although I think Tony Blair has much to answer for, this movie is an unfair, unpleasant hatchet job.  And it is permeated with the anti-Americanism of the European left.DVD Extras: Comments by scriptwriter, primary actors, director. Short, mundane, laudatory, totally predictable.  Comment by scriptwriter: ""the rules of the thriller drama are almost like grand opera ... are very strict and formal, twists and turns of plot, and I like that""Examples avoiding significant spoilers--------------------------------------The first ghost writer (henceforth GW1) discovers The Secret and saves it as a Hidden Message anticipating that he might be killed, which happens during his return from a trip to see someone.  However, since he already knows The Secret: (1) he does not need to talk to that person, (2) he should know that there is negligible chance that that person would confirm The Secret (directly or indirectly), and (3) that asking questions of that person that revealed that he knew The Secret would put him in danger. Since the connection to that person was part of the public record--some of it quite prominent--if GW1 decided he needed confirmation of those facts, he could easily have interviewed that person as a legitimate and innocuous part of his role as a ghost writer without raising suspicion that he knew The Secret. Further confounding the ""logic"" is that that person wasn't home when GW1 went there, hence there was no trigger for GW1 being killed at that time.  The scriptwriter uses this nonsensical trip as a mechanism to have GW2 become aware that that person is significant.The essential clue to The Secret was readily--and implausibly--available on the Internet and in a form that would have already invited countless people to follow up to at least the same point as GW1 and GW2.  Part of the ""foul aftertaste"" of this movie is that there never is any actual evidence of The Secret, only a couple of minor coincidences that could easily have been meaningless, and likely dismissed as such. As such, The Secret would better be labeled The Flimsy Conspiratorial Conjecture.The Hidden Message is illogical.  GW1 had to know that if he was killed it would likely have been destroyed in the normal course of events before becoming available to the public (which in fact it was). And even if it survived, GW1's clue for finding it was too fragile and arcane.  And if anyone did find The Hidden Message, what good would it do?  It gave no usable information and had zero credibility, being indistinguishable from a random occurrence.The hardcopy manuscript is effectively a main character in this movie (acknowledged in the DVD Extras), and is a major implausible contrivance.  Rather than use the electronic version, GW2's rewrite is to be done on the hardcopy which is then to be typed back in (appears to be about 1500 pages).  This is howling nonsense because the book is on a tight deadline--GW2 is given only 2 weeks to do a major rewrite--and this not only reduces his productivity, but introduces multiple cycles of delays (the typing-in itself and then finding and correcting all the typos).  The conceit that this arrangement is to prevent leaks is punctured when GW2 simply walks out of the house with it, no questions asked.When the scriptwriter got to the slot in the template that called for a ""bad guy"" to lie to the main character, apparently he didn't understand that it was important what the lies were.  For example, the scriptwriter has that ""bad guy"" utter a series of lies that are themselves implausible and pointless, and ridiculous from the viewpoint of the ""bad guy"". In one of these, when the ""bad guy"" is asked where he was several weekends ago, he implausibly claims not to remember, but then _immediately_ negates his obstructionist lie by asking his wife who immediately looks it up.  He was the keynote speaker at an international conference in Aspen, not one of those inconsequential things that one immediately forgets.  Moreover, lying was against his interest: That event gave him a rock-solid alibi that was easily confirmed/refuted.Example: GW2 is an incidental witness to a crime seen by hundreds, including police and TV camera crews.  The perpetrator is unambiguous and is killed.  Case closed? No.  Although all of GW2's relevant information was learned watching a local TV news broadcast, the police take away his passport, explaining that he is their ""key witness"".  Since this particular plot element went out of style with the fall of the Soviet empire, perhaps the scriptwriter found it at a really good clearance sale at The Hack Shack (""The Writer's One-Stop Source for Recycled Materials"") and just couldn't resist padding the script with it.-- Douglas B.

Great cinematography too: This film puts you right there on Martha's Vineyard, on the planes and ferries, in NYC and London, etc. Some very fine acting as well, particularly by Olivia Williams as the former PM's wife: She is a convincingly complex and very surprising character. Several secondary but still extremely important characters are also acted and scripted with fine realism--Special mention to Robert Pugh as the angry, protesting father of a British soldier killed in Iraq.A few patchy places and cheesy plot elements: THE GHOST WRITER may be missing a piece or two somewhere.

A former aide of the Prime Minister, Mike McAra, is hired by publishers Rhinehart to do the biography, but he disappears from a ferry and is later found washed up on a beach. At the time it is assumed he committed suicide. Then a new ghost-writer (Ewan McGregor) is appointed. Lang is accused of assisting the U.S. in rendition of terrorists who were tortured for information, and this causes panic in his household sequestered on a U.S. island. Lang's personal secretary, Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall), insists that al the writing of the biography should be done within the confines of Lang's home. Then new information left by McAra comes to light and the new biographer becomes something of an investigative journalist. McAra's body doesn't wash up where it would be expected by the tidal flow. A woman who sees activity on the beach the night the body was discovered falls down stairs and ends up in a coma. An old Cambridge buddy of Lang's, Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson), turns out to be a CIA operative. The charges of Lang's complicity in the rendition are levelled by one of his former minister's that he sacked, Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh), and the ghost writer decides to assist him with his enquiries.

1328606,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B0036TGSR6,drkhimxz,"[0, 1]","For me, the most interesting aspect of the film was that I never  recognized Brosnan until I  checked on the cast. Of course, I have not seen him since a couple of years after the end of Remington Steele;  like the rest of us he has aged, but aged very well both in looks and maturity as an actor.  He and most of the cast (none of whom are familiar to me) did a fine job, very credible in their roles. Naturally, I sympathize with Polanski who lost his wife in a bizarre murder plot in the United States and is still living under the cloud of an untested (in court) rape charge, which some believe is unwarranted (and I know nothing about other than its existence); but why he should get involved with, or perpetuate, this mish-mash of a plot, I have to wonder. By reputation, he should have known how to turn whatever he was given in the book (which I have not read) into a thriller which went beyond the trite and worn scenario he filmed. A shame, too, since he had such a good cast with which to work.At any rate, I certainly commend it to any fan of Brosnan; he handles his subordinate role with excellence. The other lead players are worth watching as well. If you are a virulently anti-American in the UK (the U.S.A or anyplace else) you will probably find this quite enjoyable  for its subject matter if not its quality as a movie.

The 76-year filmmaker has made a polished yarn that brings to mind his career pinnacle,Chinatown, but the pulpish nature of the material here never allows this film to come near the classic level set by Roman Polanski's 1974 masterwork. Still, it remains crackling good entertainment on its own terms. Based on Robert Harris' 2007 novel, The Ghost, the story (adapted by Harris and Polanski) wraps around Adam Lang, a renowned world leader who is fighting extradition for past war crimes. Similarities to former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair are purely intentional since Pierce Brosnan's sharply rendered portrayal evokes such comparisons. The handsome, charismatic Lang was forced to resign when he supported a war as a favor to the U.S. President even if it irreparably damaged his reputation at home. Along with his tightly wound wife Ruth and suspiciously efficient assistant Amelia Bly, Lang is staying in a private compound on Martha's Vineyard in order to finish his memoirs.Enter a professional ghostwriter hired to finish Lang's memoirs, an assignment nearly completed when the first ghostwriter is suddenly found washed ashore on the island. The circumstances for his death are unclear, and the new writer is given just one month to spruce up what his predecessor had written. Just as the writer settles into his new role, Lang is ordered by the International Criminal Court to stand trial for handing over four suspected terrorists to the CIA for torture such as water-boarding. The gears are set in motion with the book's deadline pushed up due to the breaking news and the writer discovering information secretly left behind by his dead predecessor. The plot thickens considerably with Ruth playing a pivotal role as she unravels from the crisis and the surprise appearance of a Harvard professor named Paul Emmet whose past association with Lang may implicate the political leader in a burgeoning conspiracy that proves life-threatening to the writer. By the time the puzzle pieces come together, Polanski provides a crescendo that melds the brooding intensity of a mystery with a canny sense of political intrigue.In the title role, Ewan McGregor brings fervent energy to a nameless everyman character whose entire existence appears to rest on the secrets within the manuscript. With subtle force, Brosnan exposes the vainglorious underbelly of the Blair doppelganger, while Olivia Williams sears the screen with fierce intensity as Ruth, a cross between Hillary Clinton, Lady MacBeth and Mrs. Robinson ofThe Graduate. Polanski is not afraid to cast familiar faces in key roles like Kim Cattrall as Amelia. Initially, it's hard to shake the image of Samantha (Sex and the City: The Movie) when she strides onscreen, but the actress sharpens the buttoned-up Amelia with a real edge.  Showing up in effective cameos are Tom Wilkinson as Emmet, Timothy Hutton as Lang's attorney, a nearly unrecognizable Jim Belushi as the publishing magnate who hires the ghostwriter, and 94-year-old Eli Wallach as a beachcomber. Alexandre Desplat (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) delivers an appropriately sweeping score, while Pawel Edelman's (The Pianist) cinematography produces the right foreboding atmosphere necessary to maintain a tight vise around the mystery.",4,"Polanski Combines Politics, Paranoia and Hitchcockian Touches for an Intriguing Thriller",1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,3480,"['mounting', 'suspense', 'twisty', 'plot', 'may', 'recall', 'Hitchcock', 'richly', 'paranoid', 'mood', 'ambiguous', 'moral', 'compass', 'especially', 'climax', 'politically', 'driven', '2010', 'thriller', 'are', 'pure', 'Polanski', '76-year', 'filmmaker', 'made', 'polished', 'yarn', 'mind', 'career', 'pinnacle', 'Chinatown', 'pulpish', 'nature', 'material', 'here', 'never', 'film', 'come', 'classic', 'level', 'set', 'Roman', 'Polanski', '1974', 'masterwork', 'Still', 'crackling', 'good', 'entertainment', 'own', 'terms', 'Based', 'Robert', 'Harris', '2007', 'novel', 'Ghost', 'story', 'adapted', 'Harris', 'Polanski', 'wraps', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'renowned', 'world', 'leader', 'who', 'fighting', 'extradition', 'past', 'war', 'crimes', 'Similarities', 'former', 'UK', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'are', 'purely', 'intentional', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'sharply', 'rendered', 'portrayal', 'evokes', 'such', 'comparisons', 'handsome', 'charismatic', 'Lang', 'was', 'forced', 'resign', 'when', 'supported', 'war', 'favor', 'U.S.', 'President', 'even', 'irreparably', 'damaged', 'reputation', 'home', 'tightly', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'suspiciously', 'efficient', 'assistant', 'Amelia', 'Bly', 'Lang', 'staying', 'private', 'compound', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'order', 'finish', 'memoirs.Enter', 'professional', 'ghostwriter', 'hired', 'finish', 'Lang', 'memoirs', 'assignment', 'nearly', 'completed', 'when', 'first', 'ghostwriter', 'suddenly', 'found', 'washed', 'ashore', 'island', 'circumstances', 'death', 'are', 'unclear', 'new', 'writer', 'given', 'just', 'one', 'month', 'spruce', 'up', 'what', 'predecessor', 'had', 'written', 'Just', 'writer', 'new', 'role', 'Lang', 'ordered', 'International', 'Criminal', 'Court', 'stand', 'trial', 'handing', 'over', 'four', 'suspected', 'terrorists', 'CIA', 'torture', 'such', 'water-boarding', 'gears', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'book', 'deadline', 'pushed', 'up', 'due', 'breaking', 'news', 'writer', 'discovering', 'information', 'secretly', 'left', 'behind', 'dead', 'predecessor', 'plot', 'considerably', 'Ruth', 'playing', 'pivotal', 'role', 'crisis', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Harvard', 'professor', 'named', 'Paul', 'Emmet', 'past', 'association', 'Lang', 'may', 'implicate', 'political', 'leader', 'burgeoning', 'conspiracy', 'life-threatening', 'writer', 'time', 'puzzle', 'come', 'together', 'Polanski', 'crescendo', 'brooding', 'intensity', 'mystery', 'canny', 'sense', 'political', 'intrigue.In', 'title', 'role', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'fervent', 'energy', 'nameless', 'everyman', 'character', 'entire', 'existence', 'rest', 'secrets', 'manuscript', 'subtle', 'force', 'Brosnan', 'vainglorious', 'underbelly', 'Blair', 'doppelganger', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'screen', 'fierce', 'intensity', 'Ruth', 'cross', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'Lady', 'MacBeth', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'ofThe', 'Graduate', 'Polanski', 'not', 'afraid', 'cast', 'familiar', 'key', 'roles', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Amelia', 'Initially', 'hard', 'shake', 'image', 'Samantha', 'Sex', 'City', 'Movie', 'when', 'onscreen', 'actress', 'buttoned-up', 'Amelia', 'real', 'edge', 'Showing', 'up', 'effective', 'cameos', 'are', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Emmet', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Lang', 'attorney', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'publishing', 'magnate', 'who', 'ghostwriter', '94-year-old', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'beachcomber', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'appropriately', 'sweeping', 'score', 'Pawel', 'Edelman', 'Pianist', 'cinematography', 'right', 'foreboding', 'atmosphere', 'necessary', 'maintain', 'tight', 'vise', 'mystery']",N/A

A good mystery/political thriller, Hitchcockian or not, must have a deep mystery, a powerful beginning, the workup to a great climax and a shattering, mystery-solving, viewpoint-shifting ending. Almost all things THE GHOST WRITER does not have.Former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (a peculiarly grumpy Pierce Brosnan with a Ronald Reagan hairdo and Tony Blair smile) is writing his memoires and was paid millions as an advance. Since his first ghost writer has turned up dead on some beach in New York, the poor nameless ""Ghost"" (Ewan MacGregor, credited only as ""the ghost"") is sent in after accepting a $250,000 offer to ghost the book.As a nation (Britain) finds itself in turmoil over the PM and his alleged ""war crimes"" (kissing America's butt during our wartime), the ghost writer is trapped with the PM and his entourage at the New York home of a millionaire. Why the PM is in New York, other than he can't be extradited by the World Court in the Hague from America...it's anyone's guess. Meanwhile, the intrepid ghost is lugging around a three-inch-thick manuscript of the PM's original autobiography. You might say this is Hitchcock's ""MacGuffin"" in plain view.What ensues is a pointless, meandering and unnecessarily spooky muckfest, with MacGregor being chased by God knows whom, sleeping with the PM's wife, and tangling with Amelia Bly (the ever-revolting Kim Catrall) the PM's private secretary...or at least I think that is what she is. The film is too damned confusing. With a bit of lightning-sketch humor from MacGregor (who is charming and boyish as ever), that is about all the levity and relief this film offers.In all honesty I cannot fathom what drove me to watch this film. If this is Polanski's roundabout way of saying he's being framed, it is inappropriate. If it is an attempt at old-school mystery, it has its strengths but they are pure cinematic candy. Eerie shots, soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat (great as ever), powerhouse performances by MacGregor and Brosnan, and a large all-star cast is the good 50% of this pointless exercise.The cast including Tom Wilkinson, Olivia Williams, James Belushi, Timothy Hutton, and a special cameo by Eli Wallach are negligible inducements.At exactly two hours long, this thing also tends to drag and sag like the worst of European crime drama. In the end, the PM is assassinated, his wife is outed as a CIA agent by the ghost (point?--did she commit the war crimes then have her husband killed?), no questions asked here, and NO answers. I really hate this type of thing because it leaves the viewer so unsatisfied.

1328612,A26SV90ILK5BNO,B0036TGSR6,Ethan,"[1, 1]","Former Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) runs into difficulties as he attempts to complete his memoirs. His longtime aid turned ghost writer, died in an apparent accident. The publishers scramble to bring in a replacement, as to avoid any delays in publication. Enter Ewan McGregor as the unnamed replacement author, who is tasked with finishing the memoirs in a reduced time-frame, despite his inexperience in writing ""political"" memoirs.Due to Lang's scheduled speaking engagements, McGregor's character travels to the small town on Martha's Vineyard where Lang and his entourage are staying. As he begins reading the draft of his predecessor, he is bored by the writing, and realizes that he will have to start the narrative from scratch. During his interviews with Lang, he begins to suspect the Prime Minister of withholding some of the crucial facts from his past. He also begins to question the mysterious death of his predecessor.Lang's entire team is soon caught off guard by the accusation by his former Foreign Secretary of authorizing the illegal seizure of accused terrorist to be handed over to the American CIA for torture and questioning. This forces Lang to refocus his energy from the memoirs to repairing his reputation and defending himself against the politically harmful accusations.Of course, controversy sells. It is no surprise then that the publisher requests the memoirs be completed within the coming weeks instead of the original time frame. As the Ghost Writer investigates further into the life of Adam Lang, he begins to uncover inconsistencies in his claims. There are connections between Lang and an American professor (Tom Wilkinson) who is rumored to have worked for the CIA. As the Ghost Writer delves deeper into the life of Adam Lang, his is thrust into a conspiracy that spans nearly four decades. In the end, he must discover the truth behind the lies of Adam Lang before his meets the fate of his predecessor.The film is based upon the novel The Ghost by author Robert Harris, who also co-authored the screenplay with the film's director, Roman Polanski. This is a taut thriller, with quick pacing, genuine characters, and a twist ending that you won't see coming. The entire film feels cold and disconcerting, in thanks largely to the production design, cinematography, and minimal score. The plot generally stays faithful to that of the fantastic novel, echoing the political allusions to actual Prime Minister Tony Blair and his controversial relationship with the United States.

The characters are believable and vulnerable individuals all with their virtues and flaws, which makes you care.  They really are the victims of the situations they've gotten themselves into.  One thing, however, that made me love this film was its atmosphere.  Simply amazing.  Here we see the real genius Polanski at work (as with THE PIANIST).  How he's able to create a universe of anxiety, suspicion, and mystery by using all visual and audio means at his disposal.  There is Lang's house, of course, a magnificent setting, luxurious, but cold and sterile, blockhouse-like, concealing terrible secrets.  There is the island, the weather, desolate, gray, where the constant wind and rain enhance the feeling of despair and imminent doom.  Oh, yes, and the music.  Just listen to track 16 `The Truth about Ruth' on the soundtrack and you get into the mood.  The perfect musical accompaniment by Alexandre Desplat.  The end of the film is a masterstroke, surprising and unexpected, yet leaving all possibilities open.  THE GHOST WRITER is a story about real people committing REAL crimes.

There are quite a few recommending features: good actors, an interesting mystery and a good director who raises the viewer's interest level right out of the gate: an empty car on a ferry and a body washes up on grey, storming beach!Who? Why? How? These questions are raised but tantalizingly go unanswered as we watch Ewan McGregor's reluctance for taking up a new job, which only heightens the effect: what's going on with ex-British PM Brosnan and why did the ghost writer before McGregor (whose character--McGregor's--interestingly, is never actually named) die under mysterious circumstances and will history be repeated?The wind-swept island setting in which The Ghost (as McGregor is called) ends up is gorgeously somber, enhancing the general foreboding atmosphere as the tale weaves in and out, throwing various clues that leads the viewer seemingly everywhere but at the truth, punctuated by events that effectively shake up the picture. Unfortunately, the truth is where this movie falters.Unlike my wife and much to my dismay, I'm never good at predicting the end of movies, but this one's was particularly easy from about two-thirds of the way in and it's pathetic. Unfortunately, it seems in his zeal to paint UK-US relationships with the master-slave brush, Polanski stumbles over what could have been a truly intense story and grabs this pale reflection instead.Three stars for the gorgeous scenery, the wonderful beach house and the great acting (with the exception of the unfortunate Kim Cattrall).",3,Sinister Inanity,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,1675,"['perhaps', 'fervency', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'am', 'now', 'declare', 'disappointment', 'Ghost', 'Writer.Who', 'would', 'blame', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'recommending', 'features', 'good', 'actors', 'interesting', 'mystery', 'good', 'director', 'who', 'viewer', 'interest', 'level', 'right', 'gate', 'empty', 'car', 'ferry', 'body', 'up', 'grey', 'storming', 'beach', 'Who', 'Why', 'How', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'tantalizingly', 'go', 'unanswered', 'watch', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'reluctance', 'taking', 'up', 'new', 'job', 'only', 'effect', 'what', 'going', 'ex-British', 'PM', 'Brosnan', 'why', 'did', 'ghost', 'writer', 'McGregor', 'character', 'McGregor', 'interestingly', 'never', 'actually', 'named', 'die', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'will', 'history', 'be', 'repeated', 'wind-swept', 'island', 'setting', 'Ghost', 'McGregor', 'called', 'up', 'gorgeously', 'somber', 'enhancing', 'general', 'foreboding', 'atmosphere', 'tale', 'throwing', 'various', 'clues', 'viewer', 'seemingly', 'everywhere', 'truth', 'punctuated', 'events', 'effectively', 'shake', 'up', 'picture', 'Unfortunately', 'truth', 'where', 'movie', 'falters.Unlike', 'wife', 'much', 'dismay', ""'m"", 'never', 'good', 'predicting', 'end', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'particularly', 'easy', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'pathetic', 'Unfortunately', 'zeal', 'paint', 'UK-US', 'relationships', 'master-slave', 'brush', 'Polanski', 'over', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'intense', 'story', 'grabs', 'pale', 'reflection', 'instead.Three', 'stars', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'wonderful', 'beach', 'house', 'great', 'acting', 'exception', 'unfortunate', 'Kim', 'Cattrall']",N/A

Mystery/thriller, in this case a political thriller/suspense, is among my favorite genres and Roman Polanki's film never disappoints. I also think of it as of the masterful Ghost film. The ghosts are everywhere in the film, the ghosts of the past and regrets, including the references to the director's own personal ghosts.All directors who think they know how to set and make a thriller / suspense need to watch the movie made by 76 years old Roman Polanski and learn how to make a highly thrilling exciting movie without special impressive effects or overindulgence with blood, gore, shooting, and sex. The Ghost Writer is magnificent - intelligent, exciting, and dark. Each character is not a two-dimensional cardboard figure, but an interesting personality, each with a ghost in their past. Pierce Brosnan with each new movie shows that he is more than Bond. James Bond. Ewan McGregor did remarkably well in the lead role of the man without a name, a successful ""ghost writer"" who has received an enviable contract to make a bestseller of the autobiography of a former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Brosnan). Lang had to resign and now is facing the international tribunal on the charges related to the crimes against the British citizens during the war in Iraq. McGregor's hero with no name snatched the dream contract after the previous ""ghost writer"" who had been with Lang for years, tragically and unexpectedly died.I also want to mention Tom Wilkinson in a small role of the distinguished Harvard professor who has known the former PM since their students' days in Oxford. Olivia Williams makes Ruth Land, Adam's wife, such riveting screen presence and her character one of the most interesting among all.The film was made with such assurance, confidence and skill that it never lets the excitement and tension go for a moment. The majority of film takes place on the Martha's Vineyard Island in New England, Massachusetts, during the winter when it rains incessantly, creating oppressive and unforgiving atmosphere of imminent danger. Alfred Hitchcock whom Polanski seemed to pay homage with this film would have been pleased with it. Some scenes are worthy of the cinema textbooks. I only say that I don't recall the expression ""The Ghost in the machine"" been so remarkably well and cleverly used as in The Ghost Writer.I highly recommend to watch and re-watch The Ghost Writer because after it is over and you already know who is who and why, the film can be enjoyed as a beautiful piece of filmmaking and you can pay closer attention to the wonderful music, to creative camera work, art direction, production values and everything else that makes a film not just a flick but an event.",5,The Ghost  Story,1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,2787,"['Ghost', 'Writer', '2010', 'type', 'movie', 'love', 'film', 'making', 'best', 'Mystery/thriller', 'case', 'political', 'thriller/suspense', 'favorite', 'genres', 'Roman', 'Polanki', 'film', 'never', 'disappoints', 'also', 'think', 'masterful', 'Ghost', 'film', 'ghosts', 'are', 'everywhere', 'film', 'ghosts', 'past', 'regrets', 'including', 'references', 'director', 'own', 'personal', 'ghosts.All', 'directors', 'who', 'think', 'know', 'how', 'set', 'make', 'thriller', '/', 'suspense', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'made', '76', 'years', 'old', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'learn', 'how', 'make', 'highly', 'thrilling', 'exciting', 'movie', 'special', 'impressive', 'effects', 'overindulgence', 'blood', 'gore', 'shooting', 'sex', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'magnificent', 'intelligent', 'exciting', 'dark', 'character', 'not', 'two-dimensional', 'cardboard', 'figure', 'interesting', 'personality', 'ghost', 'past', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'new', 'movie', 'more', 'Bond', 'James', 'Bond', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'did', 'remarkably', 'well', 'lead', 'role', 'man', 'name', 'successful', 'ghost', 'writer', 'who', 'received', 'enviable', 'contract', 'make', 'bestseller', 'autobiography', 'former', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'Brosnan', 'Lang', 'had', 'resign', 'now', 'facing', 'international', 'tribunal', 'charges', 'related', 'crimes', 'British', 'citizens', 'war', 'Iraq', 'McGregor', 'hero', 'name', 'snatched', 'dream', 'contract', 'previous', 'ghost', 'writer', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'Lang', 'years', 'tragically', 'unexpectedly', 'died.I', 'also', 'want', 'mention', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'small', 'role', 'distinguished', 'Harvard', 'professor', 'who', 'known', 'former', 'PM', 'students', 'days', 'Oxford', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Ruth', 'Land', 'Adam', 'wife', 'such', 'riveting', 'screen', 'presence', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'all.The', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'such', 'assurance', 'confidence', 'skill', 'never', 'excitement', 'tension', 'go', 'moment', 'majority', 'film', 'place', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'Island', 'New', 'England', 'Massachusetts', 'winter', 'when', 'incessantly', 'creating', 'oppressive', 'unforgiving', 'atmosphere', 'imminent', 'danger', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'whom', 'Polanski', 'seemed', 'pay', 'homage', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pleased', 'scenes', 'are', 'worthy', 'cinema', 'textbooks', 'only', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'expression', 'Ghost', 'machine', 'been', 'so', 'remarkably', 'well', 'cleverly', 'used', 'Ghost', 'Writer.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watch', 're-watch', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'already', 'know', 'who', 'who', 'why', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'can', 'pay', 'closer', 'attention', 'wonderful', 'music', 'creative', 'camera', 'work', 'art', 'direction', 'production', 'values', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'flick', 'event']",N/A

This is one of those films, thankfully, that requires full attention for its 128 minute duration, as every word of the dialog is meaningful and additive to the plot/conundrum of the story.Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) is the British Prime Minister, electing to live in the US with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and crew including his personal secretary Amelia (Kim Cantrall) while the media and the public in England is outraged at the news that Lang has allegedly turned over suspected terrorists to the CIA, a move that includes the dastardly water torture rendition.  Lang is in the process of writing his memoirs with a ghost writer who just happens to be the man we saw dead in the surf at films opening.  On the mainland agent Rick Ricardelli (Jon Bernthal) convinces one of his clients to be the replacement for the dead ghost writer - the unnamed ghost is Ewan McGregor.  Reluctantly the new ghost travels out to the home of Lang and in studying the apparently inept memoir manuscript begins his re-write.  Slowly incidents occur that lead the ghost to information that all is not as it appears with Adam Lang: meetings with an apparent old Cambridge friend Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson), a wily old codger who has seen a lot on the beaches (Eli Wallach), and a time alone with Ruth while Lang is away with Amelia on a speaking tour to assuage the public hate are mixed with espionage like incidents and ultimately discoveries as to the truth about Lang. Ghost eventually breaks the code that is hidden in plain sight. It is a tight story and on that holds attention well for the long duration of the film.  There are some fine actors in small roles - James Belushi, Timothy Hutton, etc - and every detail of the script and acting is first rate. The cinematography by Pawel Edelman and the musical score by the superb Alexandre Desplat add greatly to the atmosphere. But it is the gift of Polanski that maintains the chilling tension so much a part of his directorial influence that makes this film memorable. The idea of the story is a terrifying concept that is too plausible for comfort and Polanski makes it work well.

1328618,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B0036TGSR6,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[1, 5]","This is basically a ""Bush is a war criminal"" murder fantasy, for the most part. Alan Lang, former British PM who suspiciously keeps making decisions that favor America, is going to be investigated by the Hague for turning over suspected terrorists to the CIA, under whose custody one of them dies. This makes Lang a ""murderer"" and potentially, in the bizarre world of the UN, where Iran and Libya are on human-rights councils, a war criminal.The whole film is basically a fantasy-cum-coverup expose, where his ghostwriter finds out the secret behind the demise of his predecessor. It's got touches of quirky humor here and there, and a sedate chase scene or two, but otherwise kind of a slow ride. Alan Lang is basically a stand-in for George W. Bush, whom many want to see prosecuted for ""war crimes"" in Iraq, etc. The whole film assumes that Lang's actions do in fact make him a war criminal, so be prepared for a liberal dose of that type of er, opinion. No pun intended. It's always fun, though, to watch Britishisms, which do come out in the course of conversation, well done in understated fashion by all around.Surprisingly, there are little touches of balance. The ghostwriter jokes that he is about to be killed by a peace protester, reminding us that most calls to violence today emanate from the compassionate American left (the compassionate, giving Left being a myth debunked by a surprised Arthur C. Brooks inWho Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compassionate Conservatism). Later, Lang makes a good point to the sanctimonious ghostwriter, who regards it as beneath him to work for a war criminal such as Lang. If Lang were still in power, he would make two lines at airports - one where everyone was security-checked, and one where no one was, and let's see which one his critics would put their kids on. I was shocked that this was included in the movie, but it helped make it slightly more palatable.Other than the political overtones, it's a watchable if somewhat bleak mystery movie.

The plot was unrealistic and dull. I rather see the ""Ninth Gate"" which stared Johnny Depp who at least added character to his role, athough strange. I'm amazed that ""Ghost Writer"" received good reviews from the critics. I guess that they were just supporting his legal stance with the USA for a crime that the so called victim did not want to pursue. I'm surprised that the great director of ""China Town"" and ""Rosemary Baby"" to name a few directed this peace of garbage. The ending was a let down. How stupid can anyone be...I can't wait to sell my copy or trash where it belongs. My guess is that the director wanted to get back at the USA while waiting on house arrest for a crime that is as old as my Oak tree. I rather watch ""Dum and Dummer."" I ordered the novel and hope that it's better than the movie. Rent anything other than this movie and save your money. P.S.

1328620,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0036TGSR6,Hikari,"[5, 16]","Roman Polanski hates America. Really hates it. Which is a bit of an ingrate attitude, seeing as America has given him so many opportunities to direct films in Hollywood, using American stars. Thanks to America, Roman Polanski is an internationally-famous auteur, and not just a regional European product. Mr. Polanski is also internationally-infamous for his conviction of statuatory rape of an American 13-year-old, on American soil, and that more than anything, explains his anti-American bias. Even if he does like to dress up his personal vendetta in 'political' clothing. Quite a way to treat a country who's been so good to him and who was instrumental in creating the nation of Israel. Go figure.The film is an adaptation of 'The Ghost' by Robert Harris, the screenplay of which Polanski co-wrote with the author. So, the political ideas herein are not solely Polanski's, but seeing as Harris shares Roman's anti-American bias, it becomes easy to see why Polanski would have been drawn to this project. You've probably heard the plot: a talented ghost writer between jobs (Ewan McGregor--in the style of ""Rebecca"" our main protagonist is never given a name) is hired as a last-minute replacement for another ghost writer whose body washed up on the beach while working on the memoirs of the former British Prime Minister, Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). Despite misgivings, our ghost takes the job, only to be immediately mugged by thugs who think he is carrying the manuscript. The manuscript is kept under lock and key at the PM's palatial compound on Montauk, to which our ghost goes. He has to stay at the house because the manuscript is not permitted to leave the room it's kept in. While he's there working, strange undercurrents swirl around him in the house, and the story breaks in the international media that a former cabinet minister of the PM has accused him of war crimes for his complicity in Iraqi torture. The ghost soon discovers that by continuing work on this project, there is a very good chance he will share his predecessor's fate. But what he, and we don't understand is, why? What is in the PM's past, buried deep in his memoir, that people will kill in order to keep it hidden?Now, I will give credit where credit is due: no one excels Polanski in the tension-building set-up, or in creating an atmosphere of increasingly-ratcheted up suspense. As in his Frantic (1988) with Harrison Ford, he puts a guy who is professionally accomplished yet politically naive into a sinister situation where he is completely out of his element, and turns him loose to see how he will cope. The creepy visual effects of the gray winter beach and sky outside the PM's sterile, modern house that seems entirely made of glass create this sense of forboding and opressive isolation that serves the story well. And, in whatever capacity the director deserves credit for these things, he ellicits terrific perfomances from his cast. Ewan McGregor anchors the movie, since he's in every scene. The character McGregor gives us here goes against his usual charismatic and self-confident type: something of a lost and passive man who is just drifting along with events, but watching him carry this movie, and seeing the physicality he has developed convinces me that the rumors that he was considered a leading contender for the reboot of the James Bond franchise aren't as far-fetched as previously thought.  Pierce Brosnan, best known as an affable light comedian and action star really displays his dramatic chops as the embattled PM. Here, Brosnan is portraying a man who is considered, though telegenic and popular, a political lightweight, an 'actor' rather than a serious political mind. Mr. Brosnan may have found some parallels between his character and himself: in drama school, the impossibly handsome Pierce was affectionately lampooned by his fellow classmates with the nickname ""Hollywood""--everyone predicted, rightly, that his looks would make him a huge star, but on the flip side, nobody is willing to take anyone that good looking seriously, or give them credit for more than superficial ambitions. Guess Mr. Brosnan has been able to have his cake and eat it too, thereby proving that he is more than just a pretty face.  It is impossible not to draw parallels between his fictional Adam Lang and Tony Blair, who despite being beloved for pulling his nation through the Princess Diana crisis and being elected a resounding three times by his fellow Britons, is in hindsight treated by the media intelligentsia (of which Polanski and Harris are part) with withering scorn as some sort of lapdog to two American presidents. The American government and the CIA are supposed to be the real baddies here. McGregor and Brosnan are supported by a cadre of reliable actors doing the kinds of parts they do best, most notably Tom Wilkinson and Olivia Williams. Kim Cattrall (aka Samantha on SATC) plays the PM's efficient secretary and not-so-secret mistress. She looks great, but whatever accent she's attempting drifts in and out making her something of a caricature.As strictly a piece of suspense, The Ghost Writer delivers a moody, mostly effective thriller, though portions of it could be tighter. I dozed off a time or two before things really got going. But ultimately it's impossible to divorce the action from the political subtext, and there are so many holes in the logic that the piece sinks under the weight of its own self-importance. Had this been made a generation ago, in the height of Cold War paranoia, it would have seemed to have a bit more heft. At the final reveal, we are left going . . .Is THAT it? Really? In the end, Polanski's final card, which he seems to slap down on the table with an ""A HA!"" falls flat because it doesn't even make sense. Just prior to that, there is a stunt involving an anagram of sorts that was put to much more chilling use in ""Rosemary's Baby"" with Scrabble tiles. To trot out a similar device again feels tired, and in this case is dramatically flabby.In the final analyisis of this movie, I can't say that Mr. Polanski will have won himself any new friends in the American government who are already none too fond of him, but that the British government has an even greater reason to be ticked off with Roman. Apparently Mr. Polanski does not have a high opinion of Great Britain either. Which makes him a darling in France, certainment!I found this disappointing after having looked forward to it for quite a while. It earns 4 stars for the production design, but on the whole, only a three-star effort.",3,Roman a clef,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,6574,"['Roman', 'Polanski', 'America', 'Really', 'Which', 'bit',

1328623,A3NH7PYU4AD5GA,B0036TGSR6,H. Schneider,"[3, 5]","This is Roman Polanski's latest movie. That is an issue in itself, which I have decided to ignore. I believe I can have an opinion about his work independent of moral judgments of the man's life.Polanski has made many very different movies. Some of them were very good. I can not remember any that would be classified as political thriller. Why did he decide to make this one? My hunch is that he was interested in other aspects of the story, not the main plot.The film is based on a thriller by Robert Harris. Harris normally writes a different kind of book. He is best known for `historical' thrillers, like Enigma, or Imperium, and for `alternative history' thrillers, like Fatherland, or Archangel. I like his books a lot. The Ghost was unusual in picking up a recent subject, which of course also fades more and more into history, however not entirely as long as the Iraq adventure is not finished.As a political thriller, it deals with the Iraq war and with Britain's participation in it. Brosnan plays a barely disguised version of Blair. He is the ex PM by now, and resides on an island like Martha's Vineyard as a guest of a US conglomerate that earns its bucks in `security', specializing on Middle Eastern issues. He gets accused of war crimes and the International Court starts prosecution. His American friends stand by him. He is facing a situation where he may not leave the US without danger of arrest.As a thriller, it deals with the situation of the ghostwriter. The ex-PM is writing his memoirs. His ghostwriter and long time collaborator drowns few weeks before publishing deadlines. The hastily hired replacement, McEwan, finds himself in an oddly claustrophobic situation on this island with mostly bad weather, in an isolated super-safe high- tech house, with neurotic people who are always highly strung. Main source of tension is Mrs. ex-PM, who is fighting  psycho wars with everybody, most intensively with Brosnan's personal assistant (an attractive blonde who warns off any expected ouvertures by McEwan by telling him that she misses her husband, within less than an hour of their `cooperation'.). It is an atmosphere of  suspicion, jealousy and hysteria.Suspicions about the predecessor's death begin to grow in the ghost's mind. Was he murdered? Strange clues are found in his material. Quickly McEwan finds and investigates traces of a conspiracy. His relation with the boss is not good. (On first encounter, Brosnan asks: who are you? McEwan says: I am your ghost. That is not received too favorably, though Mrs. Ex says: see, he is funny.) His relationship with the boss's wife is difficult (he asks her: did you ever want to be a proper politician yourself? she answers this insult by asking: and you, did you ever want to be a proper writer?) ...Here I have to stop relating the plot, to avoid spoilers.What do I think of the film? The plot is too contemporary to be a comfortable subject for a thriller. Its characters are too identifiable. It is too easy to confuse fiction with allegations. If it were mainly meant to carry a political message, it is too indecisive and loses its steam through its fictional elements. As we say in German: not fish, not meat.The political message that stands, independent of twists and turns of the plot, is the accusation that every single decision that the ex-PM has taken as PM was in the interest of a foreign government.Esthetically, the island life and the siege situations, when protesters and press bother the inmates of the `asylum', have a strong identity and mood.

1328626,A1I60AO06W5BMB,B0036TGSR6,Ivo Shandor,"[1, 1]","""The Ghost Writer"" (starring Ewan McGregor, not to be confused with ""Ghost Writer"" starring David Boreanaz) is one of those films that as soon as you reach the end of it, you immediately want to go back and watch it again, knowing what you know now.  And if you do, you'll find that this film contains some incredibly powerful and extremely subtle acting, especially from Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, and Tom Wilkinson.I don't want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that the film seems completely credible when you view it the first time, and then becomes even more powerful upon viewing it a second time - all thanks to the phenomenal acting.  Think of how challenging it is to an actor to know that the first time around the audience will view you one way, but the next time around they will view you another way, and both ways have to seem credible each time, but was only filmed once.  The only weak acting is Kim Cattrall's scene where she has to cry, which comes across as forced; you watch the scene and know that the only reason she's ""crying"" is because the script told her to at that point.  But the rest of the cast is awesome.There are some deficiencies in the directing and the writing: scenes shot from angles that don't make clear sense, things that could have been made clearer in dialogue, plot points that should have been elaborated on but which feel missing.  And there is some unnecessary confusion regarding ""Rhinehart"" (the publisher) and ""Richard Rycart"" (the Foreign Secretary) and even the ghost writer's agent, ""Rick Ricardelli"" (Jon Bernthal).  With 26 letters in the English alphabet you'd think less similar names could have been chosen.  Even if these were the names in the original book (""The Ghost"" by Robert Harris) that doesn't mean they couldn't have been changed for a film audience's ears.Last but not least, a shout-out for Alexandre Desplat (""Harry Potter,"" ""Argo"") whose score for this film sets the mood brilliantly and hauntingly.In short, this is an underrated film that deserves more attention than it received.

1328629,A1A535W556ROBQ,B0036TGSR6,James Ferguson,"[2, 4]","Polanski has long had a way of turning genre movies on their head, and making tired old scripts seem fresh and cleanly written.  Of course it helps when you start with good material as is the case with Robert Harris'The Ghost Writer, who also co-wrote the script.  The intriguing plot turns nicely on itself, and Polanski keeps you guessing throughout the movie.  Adam Lang, impeccably played by Pierce Brosnan, bears some rather striking resemblances to Tony Blair, but rather than offer some polemic on the illegal renditions that were conducted in Europe, the ""ghost,"" finds there is much more to Lang's autobiography than meets the eye.Ewan McGregor brings the viewer into the story, as he tries to finish off a manuscript left behind by a previous ghost writer who was found washed up on a secluded shoreline, not far from the austere beach house of Adam Lang.  The setting may be Martha's Vineyard, but Polanski had to do all his shooting in Denmark and Germany, as he has long been considered persona non grata in the States and Britain.  You get the feeling he is teasing his nemeses, as well as viewers, with this finely scripted drama, as the ""ghost"" uncovers juicy bits of information pointing to an unsavory relationship between Lang and the US.  But, these are for the most part carefully conceived distractions, as the real story is locked away in the manuscript, which the ""ghost"" eventually unlocks, but finds himself having to pay a heavy price for it.Olivia Williams is excellent as Lang's jaded wife, Ruth, and Kim Catrall is barely recognizable as Lang's administrative secretary.  Like in many of his previous films, Polanski chooses to imply motives rather than broadly state them, leaving the viewer to piece together the underlying stories.  He provides sinister foils and desolate scenes to underscore the menacing tone of this film.  The Ghost Writer seems to float on the edge of the supernatural, thanks to the remote Romo, Denmark, location, like Shakespeare's Hamlet.  Ultimately, the films plays out pretty much as you would expect it too, but not without an Agatha Christie twist in the end.

He then discovers that the Prime Minister's associates are hooked up with the CIA.He threatens to reveal this when, as above, everyone already knows the Prime Minister has arguably committed a war crime, and when any free world leader is likely hooked up with the CIA.So the only thing the ghost writer knows that's fresh or interesting is that the former ghost writer may have been murdered.

1328632,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B0036TGSR6,Jason Bean,"[6, 8]","Despite his personal life, I've always loved Roman Polanski's thrillers. I'll admit he's not always on the mark with movies but when he is he strikes gold. The Ghost writer, based on Robert Harris' novel (who also wrote the screenplay) is one of the best thrillers to come around in a long time.The plot of Ghost Writer involes a nameless writer (an excellent McGregor) who's been hired to spend a month with a Tony Blair-ish former prime minister (perfectly cast Pierce Brosnan) and ghost-write his memoirs, replacing another biographer who died under mysterious circmstances. As our protagonist interviews the prime minister and his wife he ends up getting involved (in more ways than one) with them and uncovers political secrets, lies and cover-ups that threaten his own life. Like the novel the plot of the film sometimes flirts with the predictable, but it's always engaging and even manages to catch you off-guard with some surprising humor and insight into the creative writing process.The cast in this film is both terrific and unexpected. It's been a while since Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan have done a film worthy of note and they've never been better than in the Ghost Writer. Kim Cattral is surprisingly good (and surprisingly well-cast) as the Prime Minister's assistant. Olivia Williams is absolutely brilliant as the Prime Minister's long suffering wife.

1328640,A9TG2NFA614S9,B0036TGSR6,John F. Rooney,"[122, 132]","""The Ghost Writer"" is a Roman Polanski political thriller of the first order. It is very cleverly plotted with gripping suspense and narrative drive that pulls you into the story. Some movies of late have seemed endless; in this one I was completely unaware of time passing and was completely enthralled by this story of the deepest intrigue. It's full of conspiracies, and the whole thing is done in a very classy, sophisticated manner that will remind you of Hitchcock at his very best. It's engrossing and involving.The acting is top-notch with Ewan McGregor very effective as the ghost writer who has been brought in to liven up the memoirs of a former prime minister (played extremely well by Pierce Brosnan). He is a Tony Blair figure who has been fingered for war crimes by one of his former cabinet ministers. He has ordered the arrest and rendering out of Britain of suspects so that they could be tortured for information.The movie begins in gloomy, leaden weather on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard. A car is discovered without a driver. The man's body turns up later on the island, the victim of accident, suicide, or as we rightly assume, murder. Foul play indeed! He is the previous ghost writer who has now been replaced by McGregor. And of course he found out too much while doing his research. McGregor, of course, knows he could be a target as well.Polanski has deliberately made very mundane matters seem full of import and menace. It's full of clues and mysterious doings in the austere modernistic house so alien to the Vineyard. The cinematography and atmospherics are terrific. A lot of sinister-seeming goings-on.They don't make them this good anymore, and I think viewers will be pleasantly surprised.

1328641,ARK323I3EV98D,B0036TGSR6,Jordan D. Wilson,"[2, 3]","""The Ghost Writer"" is the work of a true master. It is Roman Polanski's eighteenth film as a director, and it proves--if it needed further proving--that at age 77, he just as brilliant a filmmaker as he ever was. He has made one of his best films to date, a taut, pulse-pounding political thriller of Hitchcockian proportions that also contains echoes of his own films, particularly ""Chinatown"" and ""Rosemary's Baby.""Ewan McGregor plays a nameless man whose past is left a mystery. He is hired by a publisher to ghost write ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang's (Pierce Brosnan) memoirs. The previous ghost, a long time aid to Lang, was found dead, washed up along the beach near Lang's beach house in Martha's Vineyard, his car still on the crossing ferry. It is assumed that he was either drowned accidentally or committed suicide, but Polanski lets us know in more ways than one that it will probably not be that simple. The sense of foreboding that the director creates forms its grip on us from the opening shot, and never lets go for a second.Lang's beach house is a fortress of secrets surrounded by stormy, grey skies that constantly threaten to shed rain at any moment. The new ghost arrives and is welcomed by Lang's aid, Amelia (Kim Cattrall), who is also his mistress. This is no secret to Lang's wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams), a lonely but tough woman who is deeply detached from her husband.Just as the new ghost arrives, Lang who comes under severe political attack over his loyalties to American foreign activities, including rendition and other war crimes. This leaves the ghost wondering gravely what he has gotten himself into, and if his predecessor's death was really just an accident, or something more sinister. Polanski gives us no reason to believe otherwise, and as the ghost becomes immersed in Lang's world of secrets, lies, deceit and CIA cover-ups, he realizes that his two-week deadline to finish Lang's memoirs is the very least of his concerns.What is truly stunning about this film, aside from Polanski's sharp and menacing direction, is the amount of information that is retained from the audience. Even as the ghost unpeels the layers Lang's past, and slowly begins to understand what is going on, we are never quite certain about everything. In many cases in a film like this, the pieces are all there and it is our job and the protagonist's job to connect them. In ""The Ghost Writer,"" I think that Polanski and co-writer Robert Harris have deliberately chosen to withhold some pieces of the puzzle in order to generate the kind of doubt and anticipation that we experience throughout this film.McGregor gives an excellent central performance as the new ghost trying to put together the events taking place, and his scenes with Williams, some of the more seemingly ambiguous scenes in the film, are wonderfully acted. This is also some of the best work that Brosnan has ever done, as the ex-PM who is attempting to both save his reputation and process his memoirs, while carefully trying to keep the truth submerged beneath what the people want to hear. He has only a few major scenes, but manages to communicate a lot in them.Polanski also plays with modern technology, namely the GPS system, which is used in one brilliant scene where the ghost's predecessor communicates vital information to him from beyond the grave. In another scene, the ghost talks to an old man (Eli Wallach) who says that the current shouldn't have washed the former ghost up along the beach where it did, and that a key witness to it is in a coma. There is also an ingenious moment toward the end involving the passing of a note that keenly evokes Hitchcock.  These kinds of moments, which occur frequently through the film--in nearly every scene, in fact--allow the tension to build and build, until I could actually feel my heart racing.The setting of the film also adds to the growing anticipation, and the ominous tone of the film, as the beach house where the ghost spends most of his time is cut off from the mainland. It is a hazy, cold, isolated, drizzly place where bad things are almost certainly bound to happen. ""The Ghost Writer"" is one of the most intensely crafted thrillers in recent years, as it blends classic Hitchcock themes with modern political allusions, while Polanski, I think, also manages to slip in some very personal incite into his own controversial situation with the law.

1328643,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0036TGSR6,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[25, 27]","Watching this film for the second time I was struck by how great of a director Roman Polanski is. This is a director, who at the age of 76 can still direct a high-minded suspense thriller that doesn't rely on violence or even plot to drive the suspense; a a throwback to classic suspense films, driven by atmosphere and directorial skill.Ewan McGregor plays the unnamed ghost writer hired to ghostwrite the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) after Lang's previous ghostwriter dies under mysterious circumstances. Soon after the Ghost arrives at Lang's beach house, where he's staying with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and assistant Amelia (Kim Cattrall), controversy erupts over Lang's alleged involvement in handing terrorist suspects over to the CIA to be tortured.Many recognizable faces appear in The Ghost Writer including James Belushi, Timothy Hutton, and Tom Wilkinson, in a terrific bit role. 95-year-old Eli Wallach also participates in the film and his brief scene brought a smile to my face. The performances are solid all-around; Ewan McGregor carries the film as the mysterious protagonist, while Pierce Brosnan gives his best performance in years as Adam Lang. Even Kim Cattrall does a solid job that should silence the skepticism over her cast. Olivia Williams (probably best known for Rushmore) makes the biggest impression in a performance that will likely be tragically overlooked come Oscar season.The Ghost Writer is a masterpiece of atmosphere and tone, being more in control of those elements than almost any recent film that I can think of. There's a sense of dread that hangs over the entire film, inviting similarities to Polanski's The Ninth Gate (which I believe Polanski was aware of with the addition of the mysterious motorcyclist early in the film). Polanski greatly utilizes his brilliant cinematographer Pawel Edelman, wonderful production design, and completely unnoticeable green screen effects to capture exactly the atmosphere he envisioned. With a complete grasp over this atmosphere, the film really draws you in to the story. A quietly foreboding score by Alexander Desplat also lends to the film's suspenseful atmosphere and will also likely find itself overlooked for Best Original Score.Viewers have criticized the Ghost using Google search which is just lazy, idiotic criticism. The Ghost doesn't solve any huge mystery, but merely finds a few clues that seemed perfectly reasonable to find. The internet is a remarkable tool and in a world with access to such a vast source of information, why can't a film protagonist use it? I was so involved in the film at this point; I had no problem with him using it. As for the film being political ""propaganda,"" this is false. Much like the term ""pretentious"" is now used by people to describe something they don't like or understand; ""propaganda"" is being used to describe this film by people who don't agree with the parallels the film makes with Tony Blair and his relationship with the U.S. government. The Ghost Writer is a political suspense-thriller meant to entertain, not to sway anyone's political opinion. Regardless of the political implications it may make, you can't deny the film's greatness.The film's ending is so well-filmed and well-executed, it's a testament to what a masterful director Roman Polanski is. The complaints about the ending can only come from people expecting a typical Hollywood-thriller where everything is wrapped up nicely with the good guy going home and the bad guy(s) going to jail. Those familiar with the work of Polanski will be pleased that he hasn't lost his pessimistic outlook. It's a first-rate ending that is so poetic it's a perfect end to this great film.The Ghost Writer is the best suspense film of 2010 and one of the best films of 2010. Polanski remains one of the great suspense directors and his latest film is so well-made and so well-acted, I cannot heap enough praise on it. I hesitate to call a film perfect, but The Ghost Writer is as near-perfect as movies get. They rarely make films like this anymore.GRADE: A*For the American release of the film some profanity is noticeably dubbed over. Editing the film's profanity to get a PG-13 rating was a ridiculous decision as I can't imagine anyone under 17 wanting to see this film. With that said, the noticeable dubbing did not affect my enjoyment of the movie and it gives the moment when the ""f-word"" is used much more of an impact. With that said, a DVD-release should have given us a version with the original dialogue restored.",5,The Best Suspense Film of 2010,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,4569,"['Watching', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'great', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'director', 'who', 'age', '76', 'can', 'still', 'direct', 'high-minded', 'suspense', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'rely', 'violence', 'even', 'plot', 'drive', 'suspense', 'throwback', 'classic', 'suspense', 'films', 'driven', 'atmosphere', 'directorial', 'skill.Ewan', 'McGregor', 'unnamed', 'ghost', 'writer', 'hired', 'ghostwrite', 'memoirs', 'former', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Lang', 'previous', 'ghostwriter', 'dies', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Soon', 'Ghost', 'arrives', 'Lang', 'beach', 'house', 'where', 'staying', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'assistant', 'Amelia', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'controversy', 'erupts', 'Lang', 'alleged', 'involvement', 'handing', 'terrorist', 'suspects', 'CIA', 'be', 'tortured.Many', 'recognizable', 'appear', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'including', 'James', 'Belushi', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'terrific', 'bit', 'role', '95-year-old', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'also', 'film', 'brief', 'scene', 'brought', 'smile', 'face', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'all-around', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'film', 'mysterious', 'protagonist', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'best', 'performance', 'years', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'Even', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'solid', 'job', 'should', 'silence', 'skepticism', 'cast', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Rushmore', 'biggest', 'impression', 'performance', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'tragically', 'overlooked', 'come', 'Oscar', 'season.The', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'masterpiece', 'atmosphere', 'tone', 'being', 'more', 'control', 'elements', 'almost', 'recent', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'sense', 'dread', 'entire', 'film', 'inviting', 'similarities', 'Polanski', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'believe', 'Polanski', 'was', 'aware', 'addition', 'mysterious', 'motorcyclist', 'early', 'film', 'Polanski', 'greatly', 'brilliant', 'cinematographer', 'Pawel', 'Edelman', 'wonderful', 'production', 'design', 'completely', 'unnoticeable', 'green', 'screen', 'effects', 'capture', 'exactly', 'atmosphere', 'envisioned', 'complete', 'grasp', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'really', 'story', 'quietly', 'foreboding', 'score', 'Alexander', 'Desplat', 'also', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'atmosphere', 'will', 'also', 'likely', 'find', 'overlooked', 'Best', 'Original', 'Score.Viewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'Ghost', 'using', 'Google', 'search', 'just', 'lazy', 'idiotic', 'criticism', 'Ghost', ""n't"", 'solve', 'huge', 'mystery', 'merely', 'few', 'clues', 'seemed', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'find', 'internet', 'remarkable', 'tool', 'world', 'access', 'vast', 'source', 'information', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'film', 'protagonist', 'was', 'so', 'involved', 'film', 'point', 'had', 'problem', 'using', 'film', 'being', 'political', 'propaganda', 'false', 'Much', 'term', 'pretentious', 'now', 'used', 'people', 'describe', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'understand', 'propaganda', 'being', 'used', 'describe', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'parallels', 'film', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'relationship', 'U.S.', 'government', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'political', 'suspense-thriller', 'meant', 'entertain', 'not', 'sway', 'anyone', 'political', 'opinion', 'Regardless', 'political', 'implications', 'may', 'make', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'film', 'greatness.The', 'film', 'ending', 'so', 'well-filmed', 'well-executed', 'testament', 'what', 'masterful', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'complaints', 'ending', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'people', 'expecting', 'typical', 'Hollywood-thriller', 'where', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'good', 'guy', 'going', 'home', 'bad', 'guy', 's', 'going', 'jail', 'familiar', 'work', 'Polanski', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', ""n't"", 'lost', 'pessimistic', 'outlook', 'first-rate', 'ending', 'so', 'poetic', 'perfect', 'end', 'great', 'film.The', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'best', 'suspense', 'film', '2010', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010', 'Polanski', 'one', 'great', 'suspense', 'directors', 'latest', 'film', 'so', 'well-made', 'so', 'well-acted', 'can', 'not', 'heap', 'enough', 'praise', 'hesitate', 'call', 'film', 'perfect', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'as', 'near-perfect', 'movies', 'get', 'rarely', 'make', 'films', 'anymore.GRADE', 'American', 'release', 'film', 'profanity', 'noticeably', 'dubbed', 'Editing', 'film', 'profanity', 'get', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'decision', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', '17', 'wanting', 'see', 'film', 'said', 'noticeable', 'dubbing', 'did', 'not', 'affect', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'moment', 'when', 'f-word', 'used', 'much', 'more', 'impact', 'said', 'DVD-release', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'version', 'original', 'dialogue', 'restored']",N/A

1328646,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B0036TGSR6,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[5, 9]","""The Ghost Writer"" is far and away the best film of 2010, despite the criminal and moral controversy of Director Roman Polanski. Perhaps it is these very qualities which give him insight into dark and crooked minds, for let it be declared: Dark and crooked deeds are afoot in this film.Ewan McGregor's character--symbolically nameless in the film--replaces the dead ""ghost writer"" behind the memoirs of the previous prime minister of England. His (the PM's) dirty deeds come to light--a symbolic phrase representative of symbolic darkness and light throughout the film--and a firestorm of anger breaks loose at the revelation of torture the PM allowed to be used to gain information.Who, of course, can condone torture? This is where Polanski fairly shows both sides of this controversy and the related racial and religious profiling. Pierce Brosnan's character (the PM) asks pointedly: Which airline would you rather fly--the one that pulls certain people aside for close examination or the one that allows all passengers through checkpoint to prevent profiling? The answer is, of course, two-sided--the public answer and the private answer.So much is hidden and kept under lock and key (literally), but the deepest secret is not even known. McGregor's character discovers hidden information left by his deceased predecessor in the same room both inhabit(ed). The previous ghost writer's death was ruled accidental; the new ghost writer finally believes otherwise. Surely, the predecessor was killed and now maybe, he, too, is in terrible danger.When he finally discovers the deepest and darkest secret, it is too late.The acting is superlative all around, film editing is perfectly executed. Filmed in New England in a moody, misty, gloomy, almost menacing setting along the Atlantic coast, the story becomes reflective of its atmosphere: brooding, haunting, secretive, with each minute, each scene just sitting on the edge and suggestive of something imminently horrible. The great irony, as in the discovery of the torture the PM allowed, is the setting in Martha's Vineyard, the very name of refinement. But here, in its midst, is something dark. In fact, a wall-sized picture window overlooking this ominous ocean-front scene suggests the sinister watcher quality of the PM.

In The Ghostwriter Polanski dabbles at the edge of autobiography in the character of Adam Lang, a former British Prime Minister exiled from England and subject to arrest in most of the world due to war crime accusations. Perhaps it is this convergence of art and autobiography that lead to Polanski's recent legal developments.Ewan McGregor is a ghostwriter to Pierce Brosnan's Adam Lang who is facing war crimes charges in the Hague. McGregor is hired as a ""ghost"" to rewrite Lang's memoirs after the accidental death of the previous ghostwriter. McGregor inadvertently finds evidence that the death of his predecessor wasn't so accidental and they've both stumbled upon a secret of Lang's early political career that would cast a different shadow on his legacy as Prime Minister.This is a thriller that isn't based all on action, car chases, shootouts, or explosions. It's a thriller that pulls you in because of the intrigue of the characters and the events that are created by them or are pulled into. The two male leads of McGregor and Brosnan are two excellent performances. McGregor gives a nuanced performance as ""the ghost"" as the only name he's given in the movie, a slightly disheveled writer who doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Brosnan is right on as the former Prime Minister. A man who has had days in power, but still has the self-possessed confidence and retains the subliminal air of authority that everybody looks to when he enters the room. Kim Cattrall is a surprise as Amelia Bly, Lang's assistant. Even though it's suggested that she may have been or is Lang's lover, Cattrall shows here that she can play more than the sexpot or coquette that she has played in ""Sex and The City."" Timothy Hutton is good as he is in almost anything he does and it's too bad his part wasn't larger. Eli Wallach has a cameo as a crotchety old man who gets McGregor's ghost to start questioning what's going on.The Ghostwriter isn't a flashy thriller that throws special effects, or car chases at you. As a matter of fact the only would be car chase is aborted because `the ghost' pulls his car off the road and lets the chasing car pass him. The intrigue and thrilling elements are delivered by the situation these characters find themselves in and how the events occur and how the characters struggle to find the resolution to the puzzle.The DVD bonus features are minimal but give you a nice look inside the production of The Ghostwriter. They include an interview with screenwriter Robert Harris on how he came upon the idea of The Ghostwriter and how it evolved into its final form. A 10 minute interview with the major cast members about their characters, and an interview with Polanski on what he saw in The Ghostwriter.",4,Low Key Thriller That Pulls You In and Keeps You In,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,2828,"['Roman', 'Polanski', 's', 'movies', 'don', 't', 'ordinarily', 'lend', 'autobiographical', 'insight', 'Ghostwriter', 'Polanski', 'edge', 'autobiography', 'character', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'former', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'exiled', 'England', 'subject', 'arrest', 'most', 'world', 'due', 'war', 'crime', 'accusations', 'Perhaps', 'convergence', 'art', 'autobiography', 'lead', 'Polanski', 'recent', 'legal', 'developments.Ewan', 'McGregor', 'ghostwriter', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'who', 'facing', 'war', 'crimes', 'charges', 'Hague', 'McGregor', 'hired', 'ghost', 'rewrite', 'Lang', 'memoirs', 'accidental', 'death', 'previous', 'ghostwriter', 'McGregor', 'inadvertently', 'evidence', 'death', 'predecessor', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'accidental', ""'ve"", 'stumbled', 'secret', 'Lang', 'early', 'political', 'career', 'would', 'cast', 'different', 'shadow', 'legacy', 'Prime', 'Minister.This', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'based', 'action', 'car', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'explosions', 'thriller', 'intrigue', 'characters', 'events', 'are', 'created', 'are', 'pulled', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'McGregor', 'Brosnan', 'are', 'two', 'excellent', 'performances', 'McGregor', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'ghost', 'only', 'name', 'given', 'movie', 'slightly', 'disheveled', 'writer', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'gotten', 'Brosnan', 'right', 'former', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'A', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'days', 'power', 'still', 'self-possessed', 'confidence', 'subliminal', 'air', 'authority', 'everybody', 'when', 'room', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'surprise', 'Amelia', 'Bly', 'Lang', 'assistant', 'Even', 'suggested', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Lang', 'lover', 'Cattrall', 'here', 'can', 'play', 'more', 'sexpot', 'coquette', 'played', 'Sex', 'City', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'good', 'almost', 'anything', 'too', 'bad', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'larger', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'cameo', 'crotchety', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'McGregor', 'ghost', 'start', 'questioning', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'Ghostwriter', ""n't"", 'flashy', 'thriller', 'special', 'effects', 'car', 'chases', 'matter', 'fact', 'only', 'would', 'be', 'car', 'chase', 'aborted', 'ghost', 'pulls', 'car', 'road', 'chasing', 'car', 'pass', 'intrigue', 'thrilling', 'elements', 'are', 'delivered', 'situation', 'characters', 'find', 'how', 'events', 'occur', 'how', 'characters', 'struggle', 'find', 'resolution', 'puzzle.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'minimal', 'give', 'nice', 'look', 'production', 'Ghostwriter', 'include', 'interview', 'screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Harris', 'how', 'came', 'idea', 'Ghostwriter', 'how', 'evolved', 'final', 'form', '10', 'minute', 'interview', 'major', 'cast', 'members', 'characters', 'interview', 'Polanski', 'what', 'saw', 'Ghostwriter']",N/A

This is how the story goes: When a successful British ghostwriter, The Ghost, agrees to complete the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang, his agent assures him it's the opportunity of a lifetime. But the project seems doomed from the start--not least because his predecessor on the project, Lang's long-term aide, died in an unfortunate accident. The Ghost flies out to work on the project, in the middle of winter, to an oceanfront house on an island off the U.S. Eastern seaboard. But the day after he arrives, a former British cabinet minister accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA -- a war crime. The controversy brings reporters and protesters swarming to the island mansion where Lang is staying with his wife, Ruth, and his personal assistant and mistress, Amelia. As The Ghost works, he begins to uncover clues suggesting his predecessor may have stumbled on a dark secret linking Lang to the CIA -- and that somehow this information is hidden in the manuscript he left behind. Was Lang in the service of the American intelligence agency while he was prime minister? And was The Ghost's predecessor murdered because of the appalling truth he uncovered?The cast led by Ewan McGregor (as The Ghost) & Pierce Brosnan (as Adam Lang) is excellent! The directing by Roman Polanski (who also wrote the screenplay and produced) (who also directed ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), ""Chinatown"" (1974) & ""The Pianist"" (2002, which won him the Best Director Oscar, he also produced) is excellent!

1328653,A356RFKNIG043B,B0036TGSR6,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","Despite some obvious plot holes (finding a CIA mole link by simply googling the guy?), Ghost Writer benefits from a fine script, pleasantly low-key direction, a wonderful lack of violence, and a very solid and understated performance from Ewan McGregor.Even Brosnan acts well here, not always the case, and Williams is also convincing. In fact, all the acting is good, which one can credit Polanski for, famous for being an actors' director. He clearly knows how to make his actors comfortable, and by giving them good material to work with paves the way for quality. The plot is excellent, and Harris' book gets a good treatment here. The overall idea is well worth considering, and part of this movie's appeal is indeed its willingness to confront various political realities most of us would rather not think about.I'm not sure if it's because of his getting busted for the rape charge (or vice-versa), but Polanski has made a few of the better conspiracy-shaping-American-history movies, most notably of course Chinatown. I've always wondered about his getting busted in LA, the town that Chinatown exposes as full of cheating, scheming politicians and businessmen. Was the bust an act of revenge from LA's power elite? Was it a set-up or was Polanski doing what he was accused of? There are few popular movies that expose LA like that one, and only one director who's not allowed back in America. Quite a coincidence in any case.Maybe Polanksi made Ghost Writer mainly to slam hypocrisy in the land that still wants to jail him? One thing for sure, the plot's central theme---that our leaders could stand trial for war crimes for the torturing done in Iraq by the CIA---can't sit well with Cheney, W, Blair and the boys. A little too close to home, and all too legally accurate. Most reviews shy away from this fact, but it's the central theme of the movie, and one well worth considering at length.I think this film will wear very well as the years go by, and perhaps be seen as prescient. It's certainly Hitchcockian in many good ways, and Polanski's refusal to fill the screen with bullets and blood, instead choosing subtle moments and plenty of quiet face time with good actors at the top of their games, McGregor most of all, is simply intelligent filmmaking.",4,Unusually intelligent quiet political thriller,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,2270,"['obvious', 'plot', 'holes', 'finding', 'CIA', 'mole', 'link', 'simply', 'googling', 'guy', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'benefits', 'fine', 'script', 'pleasantly', 'low-key', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'lack', 'violence', 'very', 'solid', 'understated', 'performance', 'Ewan', 'McGregor.Even', 'Brosnan', 'well', 'here', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'Williams', 'also', 'convincing', 'fact', 'acting', 'good', 'one', 'can', 'credit', 'Polanski', 'famous', 'being', 'actors', 'director', 'clearly', 'how', 'make', 'actors', 'comfortable', 'giving', 'good', 'material', 'work', 'paves', 'way', 'quality', 'plot', 'excellent', 'Harris', 'book', 'good', 'treatment', 'here', 'overall', 'idea', 'well', 'worth', 'considering', 'part', 'movie', 'appeal', 'indeed', 'willingness', 'confront', 'various', 'political', 'realities', 'most', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'think', 'about.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'getting', 'busted', 'rape', 'charge', 'vice-versa', 'Polanski', 'made', 'few', 'better', 'conspiracy-shaping-American-history', 'movies', 'most', 'notably', 'course', 'Chinatown', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'getting', 'busted', 'LA', 'town', 'Chinatown', 'full', 'cheating', 'scheming', 'politicians', 'businessmen', 'Was', 'bust', 'act', 'revenge', 'LA', 'power', 'elite', 'Was', 'set-up', 'was', 'Polanski', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'accused', 'are', 'few', 'popular', 'movies', 'expose', 'LA', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'director', 'who', 'not', 'allowed', 'back', 'America', 'coincidence', 'case.Maybe', 'Polanksi', 'made', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'mainly', 'slam', 'hypocrisy', 'land', 'still', 'jail', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'plot', 'central', 'theme', 'leaders', 'could', 'stand', 'trial', 'war', 'crimes', 'torturing', 'done', 'Iraq', 'CIA', '-ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'Cheney', 'W', 'Blair', 'boys', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'too', 'legally', 'accurate', 'Most', 'reviews', 'shy', 'away', 'fact', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'one', 'well', 'worth', 'considering', 'length.I', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'wear', 'very', 'well', 'years', 'go', 'perhaps', 'be', 'seen', 'prescient', 'certainly', 'Hitchcockian', 'many', 'good', 'ways', 'Polanski', 'refusal', 'fill', 'screen', 'bullets', 'blood', 'instead', 'choosing', 'subtle', 'moments', 'plenty', 'quiet', 'face', 'time', 'good', 'actors', 'top', 'games', 'McGregor', 'most', 'simply', 'intelligent', 'filmmaking']",N/A

It may be just me, it had really good suspense and acting, yet the leads didn't seem to bring closure to me. Its about a former Prime Minister who is being thrown in the media for committing war crimes. Before this happens he has a ghost writer writing his memoirs, who unfortunately dies in a drowning that has some possible funny business written on it. In walks Ewan, the next ghost writer picking up the slack. He is very straight forward, not really evocative in his speech or manner, a person who is quiet and inward. He finds clues that cause him to ponder, did the other writer possibly get murdered. During that time his subject is being whisked away to Washington to respond to the allegations of possible terrorist suspects being tortured. The prime minister is visibly shaken and his wife who plays a strong regal woman, seems overwrought over his not following her guidance. He usually follows her advice she tells Ewan's character. Things get more involved with the couple Ewan is learning and writing about. He finds out secret information which leads to more intrigue. It is confusing did the Prime Minister get involved with the CIA before becoming a Prime Minister, or was it just his spouse involved in a triage of deceit? Was the Minister used by his wife and her tutor Emmet to be placed the role of Prime Minister in Great Britain? Did they manipulate a carefree actor who chased women by using a love interest to attract him on their path instead of his own, made by conscious choice? These are questions. Later on, was he set up somehow with the crimes, used, than taken out of commision on purpose as was his friend the first ghostwriter? Did the first writer have pertinent information to leak to the Minister before his death? Again lots of contemplation from this mystical raindrenched movie. The things I liked about this film were the beautiful glass encased room showing the long stretch of beach with sea grassy dunes spread out like a visual feast, the beauty of the compactness the house reflected, the big sandwich that Ewan had made for him by the housekeeper, the super quiet storybook hotel, with the little hostess dressed as a swiss maid and I liked the job Ewan had. It seemed like it would be fun to write and have all the accessories that came with the career. He also had the opportunity to meet people who were interesting and find out things that were something not everybody has privy to.

Or, ""How We Wish This Would Happen To Tony Blair"".Having said that, the creativity and skill factor of the filmmakers is very high. Taking the moronic and lame attempts at politicking out of the film and this becomes a very decent thriller with Ewan McGregor doing a solid performance as the ghostwriter following in the exact steps of a colleague who died under very suspicious circumstances.Again, putting aside the schoolyard politics, my only minor complaints were three fold.First, was the use of Kim Cattrall as a Brit. In all seriousness, while I'm constantly amazed at the ability of UK and Aussie actors to pull off a very convincing generic American accent - it most certainly is not a reciprocal skill. Having a US actor going about with the posh elites looks and sounds pathetically anglophile and oh-so-insecure.Second, Polanski's use of a concrete bunker was bit overmuch; he might as well have stenciled in 'Reichskanzlei' in gothic script to make his point.And finally, I question the obvious audio track edits to remove a fairly common profane word. Edits that, for all intents and purposes, had negligible effect on either storyline or character development. So why do it at all? And in the case of Brosnan's former PM - a definite weakening of what could have been a much more ominous characterization.A decent thriller for film fans, a pathetic wishful rewriting of history for liberals, and an inane stab for conservatives.

1328661,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B0036TGSR6,Matthew Kresal,"[0, 0]","The Ghost Writer will likely be remembered in the years to come as the film that director Roman Polanski was working on when he became embroiled in an extradition controversy whose roots were decades in the past. That fact seems rather sad when one looks at the film itself. Based on Robert Harris' bestselling novel The Ghost, The Ghost Writer deals with recent events by crafting a remarkable thriller around them.The film features a fine cast. Ewan McGregor plays the eponymous and unnamed lead character who is hired to help ghostwrite the memoirs of a former UK prime minister after the previous writer dies in mysterious circumstances. McGregor's performance is the heart and soul of the film as you can count on one hand the number of scenes he isn't in. Thankfully McGregor is utterly believable as a man who increasingly finds himself sinking deeper and deeper into an increasingly dangerous world until the very last scene. On the other side of the equation is Pierce Brosnan as former UK Prime Minister Adam Lang, who in the original novel was modeled on Tony Blair. While there are definitely echoes (if not downright ghosts) of Blair's time as PM in the plot, Brosnan's performance is anything but that of the man himself. Brosnan's Lang is a seasoned politician who while writing his memoirs finds himself caught up in the midst of a legal battle over potential war crimes that threatens to undo his legacy. From moments of lightness to serious moments like a conversation between McGregor's Ghostwriter and Lang on the latter's private jet, Brosnan gives perhaps the best performance of his career to date.As fine as their performances are though, McGregor and Brosnan are just part of a larger cast. Leading the supporting cast are Olivia Williams as Ruth Lang and Kim Cattrall as Lang's aide Amelia Bly, two women who seem to be at loggerheads for Lang's attention. Williams gives a fine performance as Ruth that leaves the audience thinking one thing before the final scenes change everything while the performance from Cattrail is adequate but perhaps not much else. The rest of the supporting cast includes good performances including Jon Bernthal as the Ghost's agent, Robert Pugh as former UK Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart, Timothy Hutton as Lang's lawyer and a rare dramatic turn from Jim Belushi as the memoirs publisher. There's also a nice, short appearances from Eli Wallach and Tom Wilkinson in small but pivotal roles. As a result the film is nicely acted by all concerned.Much of the atmosphere and tension of the film comes from its production values. The story unfolds in a rather dark world ranging from overcast, rain and darkness featuring heavily in the cinematography of Pawel Edelman to the grays and muted colors apparent in Albrecht Konrad's production design and Dinah Collin's costumes. As a result there is a constant sense of menace about no matter if its the publishers in London or the modern house where the memoir is being prepared in Martha's Vineyard. Director Roman Polanski lets the film unfold at its own pace which might come across as slow to those accustomed to the fast pace of most films being released today but the result is that the viewer is allowed to connect the dots along with McGregor's character. Sadly the biggest mis-fire of the production values, if not the entire film, is the score from composer Alexandre Desplat which doesn't seem well suited to the world of film and in fact undermines rather then helps the tension through the film. Overall though the production values and direction add immensely to the film as a whole.At the heart of it all is the script of course. Adapted from Robert Harris' bestselling novel The Ghost by Harris and Polanski, the film is a thriller set around recent controversial events. Those being so-called CIA torture flights, the war in Iraq and the disturbing connections between corporations involved in the defense industry and major governments. To do all this convincingly there is the memoir of former PM Lang of course and the tale of a ghostwriter who, knowing nothing about most of this, finds himself becoming increasingly deeper and deeper into it when Lang is accused of war crimes. Yet just as the viewer is led to believe that they've worked it all out, the final scenes of the film turn that very notion on its head with a twist that is truly out of left field. As with the novel, the film takes much of its basis out of reality and that makes the ending all the more shocking if not downright worrying with its potential real world implications. The result is a blueprint that is fascinating to watch and filled with tension.The Ghost Writer is a thriller and a fine one at that. From the acting of lead actors McGregor and Brosnan to the supporting cast to the production values and script, it is a film that unfolds in a world of constant gray and overcast where nothing, even when you think you've figured it all out, is what it seems. Though the film will almost certainly be overshadowed by the behind the scenes legal issues that surrounded it, it should also be remembered for being what it is: a disturbing thriller for our time.",4,A Thriller For Our Time,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,5162,"['Ghost', 'Writer', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'years', 'come', 'film', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'was',

That being said, this is a mixed review, because while I would not have missed seeing this movie once, I would not want to own it. The movie is a masterpiece of intrigue and atmosphere.  It lacks the cheap attention getters of wild car chases,  excessive foul language, needless bloody gore, and over blown, explicit sex scenes that have nothing to do with the story, for which I am very grateful. I won't deal with the details of the plot, as other reviewers have gone into it, and both the positive and negative reviews describe the story very well.  The story moves our hero, the ghostwriter, through an entire series of events, as he starts out investigating the unexpected death of the writer who had the job before him.  He discovers a huge conpiracy involving the CIA, British politics, CIA sleeper agents, America placing British leaders in their postions of power, and making sure that anyone who gets in the way meets a bad end.  (Personally, I think that if the CIA was really this good at their jobs, we would not be in the world state that we are in right now.)  The plot is interesting and involving, and draws the watcher into it, along with the hero.  You have the feeling that this could really happen to any ordinary person, to you, or someone you know.  The ghostwriter finds himself swept up into events far too large for him to deal with, leaving him with no one he can trust or turn to.  What is disturbing is that he is the only character in the story with good intentions.  Everybody else either has their own agenda or doesn't give a damn. Unfortunately the ghostwriter tries his best to do the right thing, and his good intentions get him killed in the end. That's a little too close to reality for my comfort.  Although I did not really like the ending, it fit the flow of the story and gave added dramatic impact to the story.

1328664,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0036TGSR6,mirasreviews,"[4, 9]","""The Ghost Writer"" is an adaptation of Robert Harris' political thriller ""The Ghost"", written for the screen by Harris and director Roman Polanski while the novel was still in progress. An unnamed writer (Ewan McGregor) is hired to put the finishing touches on the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) after the ghostwriter who was working on the project drowns. The new Ghost qualifies for the job, against the objections of his editor, by being fast, British, best-selling, and completely oblivious to politics. He heads to Martha's Vineyard in the United States, where Lang is living while a scandal brews in Europe. Lang's former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) has accused Lang of authorizing the illegal handover of terrorist suspects for torture by the CIA. The International Criminal Court is investigating Lang for war crimes and human rights violations.The Ghost steps into Lang's modernist beach house and into a world of politics and intrigue that he does not understand. He's just there to transform Lang's words into punchy prose. But things get dicey when he begins to investigate some leads that his predecessor had apparently followed to his death. The first hour of the film is striking in the number of extraneous shots and scenes that run too long. Tightening it up would have cured the excessive length. The cast is impressive in the depth and breadth of its talent, but the acting style is almost parody at times. I think that Polanski is invoking crime melodramas of the mid-20th century. But it doesn't work here, as not one of the characters comes across as a real person. That's an impediment when you're trying to comment on, or at least allude to, current events. The most obvious case is Kim Cattrall's kittenish portrayal of Lang's assistant Amelia. It's pure caricature and seems incongruous with her lines -which she delivers in an unidentifiable accent.Worse, the story doesn't make sense. The Ghost suspects that he is in danger, but he trusts everyone without reason, as if he has a death wish. The plot relies on people knowing things that they shouldn't logically know. It's badly written. People don't act this way, and the story is not self-contained. It runs too long. It doesn't make sense. Characters are over-the-top when they should be compelling. Olivia Williams, who plays Lang's wife Ruth, is 15 years younger than Pierce Brosnan, when part of the mystery hinges on them having met when they were young. The interiors of Lang's beach house were filmed on a set, as was necessary because of lighting. But the huge glass windows never have any sand, rain, or reflections on them. They're perfectly clear, as if they don't exist. A minor point, but I found it distracting. Why even 3 stars? ""The Ghost Writer"" is an entertaining mess. As long as you don't' think about it, it will entertain you as it goes along, though probably not in the end.The DVD (Summit Entertainment 2010): There are 3 featurettes on the disc.

There are a number of name actors and actresses in this picture, including Eli Wallach (who is arguably best known as the ""ugly dude"" in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY), who easily pump up the quality of this film.  Polansksi and his people do a wonderful job of making this a creepy experience tone and emotion at the forefront.  The ending is well done but some people won't agree or understand the long range implications and rationales.  Overall this is arguably the best suspense for its year or at least in the top three.  Pierce Brosnan, as usual, is Sterling Silver in his performance.  The film is an adaption of a novel by Robert Harris, who also wrote the screenplay.

I had forgotten some of the key plot points so I was surprised to find myself caught up again in the twists and turns of the terrific political thriller.  Former British prime minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) is vacationing on an unspecified island off the Massachusetts coast.  It is here that he had been writing his memoirs.  Needing help, he hires a ghost writer (Ewan McGregor) to rewrite the manuscript.Two events conspire to complicate what appeared to be a mundane chore.  First, the initial ghost writer and friend of Lang's has turned up mysteriously drowned on the beach.  Second, a scandal has broken regarding the former PM being involved in torturing prisoners found in Pakistan.  As ""The Ghost"" (his only name as near as I can determine) begins his rewrite he finds a handful of clues that contradict the initial biography given to him.  There is some evidence that Lang had been recruited into politics by an American professor teaching in England who has ties to the C.I.A.  In other words, Lang may have been a puppet of the U. S. government and their war in Iraq and Afghanistan.Director and co-writer Roman Polanski proves he still has it.  The tension is there and of course there is a surprise at the end.  While the movie has a few unlikely threads, it is overall very well done.  This excellent Blu ray transfer came with a DVD on the flip side instead of 2 separate discs.  There are 3 special features including an interview with Polanski.  The soundtrack is DTS-HD Master Audio on the Blu ray.

1328668,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B0036TGSR6,moviemusicbuff,"[5, 7]","This fine political drama is based on the book ""The Ghost"" by Robert Harris, and its storyline features the Hitchcockian theme of an ordinary man caught up in an overwhelmingly difficult situation -to be more specific, in a web of political intrigue.  The ghostwriter is ably played by Ewan McGregor who blends seriousness with humor. McGregor is outstanding because the whole movie revolves around his character.  The viewer identifies with him and cares about what happens to him. (Interestingly, the character of the ghostwriter is not given a name.)A. Brief SynopsisThe ghostwriter is hired to rewrite the memoirs of ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang after the first ghostwriter mysteriously dies.  As the ghostwriter digs in deeper into the memoirs, he starts to uncover some of the secrets of the Lang character, who is accused of being a war criminal and a puppet of the United States.  Pierce Brosnan does a superb job of portraying a charismatic and dynamic leader who finds it challenging to deal with the aftermath of stepping out of a powerful political office.  This is one of Brosnan's best post-007 performances.Meanwhile, the ghostwriter meets the two women who are most important in Lang's life -- his politically savvy wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams) and Lang's administrative assistant Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall).  The most interesting character for me was Ruth. Olivia Williams captures the many different sides of this complex and intelligent woman, who loves her husband but who also hates him, and finds it very difficult to deal with some of the choices he makes.  Kim Cattrall (in a role which is vastly different to Samantha in the Sex & the City series) plays Amelia Bly, the loyal assistant to the Prime Minister, who becomes like a second wife to Adam Lang.  Some of the most interesting parts in the movie are the dagger-like dialogues (more like verbal sparring) between Ruth and Amelia. They clearly hate each other but they have to cover it up and look civil in front of the ghostwriter.The ghostwriter tries to uncover the truth of how the former ghostwriter dies, and Lang's political background and ties.  Meanwhile, the memoirs of Adam Lang become a central character in the movie and takes a life of its own.As the ghostwriter tries to get behind the truth of the allegations against Adam Lang, he finds himself at great peril as powerful political figures will stop at nothing to prevent him from discovering the truth.  Although this movie starts out rather slowly, it gathers momentum and builds up to a very interesting and surprising climax.  Enough said.  You'll have to watch the movie for yourself.B.  DVD FeaturesSpecial Features:I enjoyed these 3 featurettes:1) Documentary:  The Ghost Writer: Fiction or Reality -- author Robert Harris talks about his novel and what inspired him to come up with the story after looking at Tony Blair's life in office and after seeing a real-life story of another British leader accused of being a war criminal.  Harris comments about his meaningful collaboration with director Roman Polanski.2) The Cast of the Ghost Writer:  The stars in the film (Ewan MacGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, Kim Cattrall) all talk about their positive experiences in making this movie and in working with Roman Polanski.3) Interview with Roman Polanski:  Polanski talks about his interest in turning Harris' book into a movie and his collaboration with Harris as a co-screenwriter and director of the movie.  He talks about his casting choices, his work with the director of photography, how he designed the Lang house, and how he developed the manuscript.  It was a very interesting interview.Bottom Line:  It is more of a political intrigue movie rather than a political thriller (and that's why I deleted one star).  It is not a Tom Clancy ""Jack Ryan"" sort of movie with lots of action or a John Le Carre movie like ""The Tailor of Panama"" (with Pierce Brosnan).  If you're looking for that, you'd be disappointed.  It is a satisfying political intrigue-drama with a twist of Hitchcock. Even though the story is different, this movie is more similar in feel and pacing with the earlier Roman Polanski film ""Frantic"" (1988), another Hitchcockian film starring Harrison Ford.  I appreciated the rich character development and the well-written, intelligent script in ""The Ghost Writer.""

The film doesn't require peeking through the fingers, seat belts or sending the kids next door to play. The `action' takes place in your mind. So often these days, we, the viewers are spoon fed everything and the direction one looks to is spelled out thoroughly, lest one be burdened with the aspect of thinking. I'd have to say the last good film of this vibe was `Match Point' (Woody Allen). What it has in common with `The Ghost Writer' besides the fact that both were directed by infamous men (here Roman Polanski) of questionable character, is that they are well done.The Ghost Writer concerns a writer (Ewan McGregor) hired to complete the memoirs of a former British Prime Minister (Pierce Brosnan) when the original `Ghost' suddenly dies. While researching the PM, he uncovers, stumbles upon and is led to mysterious information regarding his subject. As befits most fine mystery films, that information comes from an array of interesting characters along the way. No disappointments here, as Tom Wilkinson, Robert Pugh, and the great Eli Wallach take turns throwing curve balls.Kim Cattrall, as the PM's Chief of Staff communicates more with posture and a sly wink than most blabbermouths making the rounds in Hollywood these days.

What other directors working today can make something as slow and sneaky as this film, one that winds and wends until it delivers a powerful, brutal and scary ending? The plot of GHOST WRITER is classic Polansky. Lead character is introduced and it is obvious he is ill-equipped to deal with what rapidly comes to be recognized by the audience (and soon him) as a dire and life threatening situation. Pulled into a mysterious and dangerous world, a Polansky lead can only do one of two things - live or die. As scary as this film can be - I think it's as good FRANTIC, personally, but not as good as ROSEMARY'S BABY or CHINATOWN - this film is also very slow. And it is also very gray - VERY gray. But as this plot unwinds, you find yourself feeling deep, complex emotions that few films these days can conjure in a viewer. Olivia Williams is formidable throughout.

1328671,A154HPDBJE78Q2,B0036TGSR6,Nats,"[1, 3]","Actually, the first time I saw this film I did not think much of it, and by the end, I said to myself; is that all!!?? Well, I must not have been paying attention, or in a bad mood or something, because the second time I saw it, WOW! This is an incredible work of cinema.The film has an eerie sense of foreboding in nearly every frame.Lang's home looks like a bunker, and the grounds are lifeless and bleak.When we meet the major players, there is a tension in the air that we can't quite put our finger on.This tension builds slowly in layers with Polanski using the actors, their dialog, the buildings, the sets, the pacing, the gloomy atmosphere etc. to create a feeling that something is not quite right.The memoires themselves seem to have a life of their own, they are a character in the narative.Polanski said this movie is for adults, he is not kidding.It's clear that he did not have the American under 25 age group in mind.There are no explosions, car chases, gun battles, fast close-up cutting, jitter-cam or any of the modern Hollywood gimmicks used as cues to elicit tension and manipulate audience reactions.Polanski uses slow and deliberate pacing as he layers the narrative. Pay particularly close attention to Pierce Brosnan's performance in the beginning of the film, his demeanor, body language and dialog.A foreboding atmosphere permeates the entire film.As an added touch, the ghost writer is never named, and the dialog cleverly tip-toes around it, even to the point of throwing in a little wry humor; ""and who are you""? Lang asks, ""I am your ghost""!Lang refers to his ghost writer as ""man"", ""he always says that when he can't remember someone's name"".There is a stark realism to this film, everything is logical and all the story pieces fit together in a way that could actually happen.This is not a ""larger than life"" farfetched action thriller yarn.The film is loaded with subtle clues and nuances' in the acting, and the final 30 minutes is sheer cinematic gold.

1328676,AZN6WMC71MGWJ,B0036TGSR6,Phip,"[1, 2]","New movies are coming out all the time and it seems the two genres which are constantly popping out an influx are chic flicks and suspense/crime/thrillers. Chic flicks usually have a loyal following. Write a tear-jerking story and throw in a cute, romantic guy and you got a hit. The thriller is a little more complex. You need an intricately-wound plot line, with twists and turns and enough action to keep you into the movie. This is where I think ""The Ghost Writer"" falls short.After the tragic supposed suicide of the ghost writer for former British Prime Minister, Adam Lang's memoirs, an unnamed, unsuspecting writer is hired to continue the work. Soon after taking the job, the Ghost learns that Lang is being accused of war crimes and is under investigation. He begins to wonder what he's gotten himself. Over the course of the interviews and researching, the Ghost begins to see that some of the stories are not adding up. He probes further into the mystery and many elements remain hazy, but this much he is able to deduce: that his predecessor was murdered.There are so many technical components that gives this movie high quality, not the least of which is Roman Polanski's brilliant, detailed directing. It seems Hitchcock's ghost has been visiting him. The set of eery hotels, bleak beach houses, and dark forest roads lend a ominous quality to the film. You never feel quite safe. The cinematography employs cold lighting. The music is perfect: a little creepy, but not horror creepy. More along the lines of you can tell somethings not quite right. These are just some things that are executed with such perfection that it's sure to be studied by film students for years to come. The casting and acting is top notch. Ewan McGregor is back in his role of naive writer thrown into a story he isn't prepared for, a role he seems to have perfected (Moulin Rouge, Men Who Stare at Goats). Pierce Brosnan's acting is getting better with age. He fits the bill of the suave British Prime Minister in emotional and ethical turmoil perfectly. An unexpected talent is Olivia Williams, absolutely brilliant in her part of the Prime Minister's wife. She acts with such force and confidence that you know right away there's more to this character you're seeing right away. But the script and the plot are just too weak. You know you're supposed to feel suspicion and suspense but you don't know what it is you're suspicious of or who. There's not really a focus for your fear. Which I guess might be accurate because the Ghost doesn't really know who dunnit or who he should trust. The problem is he seems to trust everyone. He calls a number scribbled by his dead predecessor, he confides in Lang's wife, he blatantly questions an obviously suspicious source about the former writer's death, and he lays everything on the table before Lang who is the last person he should trust. And not that action is everything (this is after all a political thriller), but there is almost none of it in the whole movie. The best we get to see is a pseudo car chase and someone escaping a boat with relatively no danger.Also I don't know how Polanski can't see the parallels between Lang and himself. High profile figure under investigation for past events, sheltering in a foreign country. It's a little awkward.It's a shame that this movie wasn't better written. It has so much going for it. I would recommend seeing it because I know some people who absolutely loved it and after a few more viewings I might too.

Not expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised.  The story is expertly written, with some very unexpected twists (and others that you see coming a mile away, but are none the less suspenseful), and characters who are realistic and well-acted.  Who's-sleeping-with-who is left mostly hinted-at and understated, which is a little annoying, but at the same time a nice change from the usual fare, forcing the viewer to pay attention to subtleties and work it out for themselves.  I didn't even realize until afterward that the ghost writer had never been introduced by name - which was a clever twist in and of itself.  He really is a man without an identity of his own, and even in this story he takes on the role of his predecessor.  The timing of scenes and events throughout the storyline is perfect, and the gray, rain-drenched atmosphere really adds to the overall feel of the story.  Likewise for the sterile, cold, industrial-modern home where much of the action takes place: a mansion full of glass walls that leave the characters looking exposed to the elements, but none the less hide the secrets within - and a groundskeeper who's constantly sweeping leaves off the walkway, which promptly get blown back.  There's a metaphor in there somewhere.  The solution to the mystery is elegant and unexpected, and you get an inkling of it right about the same time as the ghost writer does.  It's brilliant and inevitable enough to make some of the earlier scenes fall into place in a whole new light.  My main quibble is with the ending, which did not grow out of the plot the way everything else did, but instead was gratuitous, disconnected, and completely unnecessary, and ruined what would otherwise have been a great little movie.  It was like the director wanted to inject some totally random negative element at the end, in a misguided attempt to be ""artsy.""

As with that film - this exiled director returns to a taut, tension-strung method of story telling.  In the extra, he himself references Raymond Chandler, whose signature is that sense of the diabolical, lying just beneath an uneasy calm.  There are no huge car chases with exploding barriers and Parkour jumps across buildings, the CGI is reserved for static backdrops (window vistas) and scenery color.A noteworthy ensemble, combined with Polish cinematographer Pawel Edelman's (The Life Before Her Eyes) gorgeous steel grey landscape, and Alexandre Desplat's Philip Glassian score complement each other.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find an interesting, well-made film that held my interest from the mysterious beginning to the almost amusing ending.  I won't relate the story since the Amazon reviewer and others have done that.After seeing it I pondered just why it was so good.  Since I'm not a film student I couldn't analyze its components and come up with a good reason.  I concluded that it was just well-done, all around.The casting is perfect.  Ewan McGregor is just right as the smart, but not-too smart guy who finds himself in a pretty mess when he accepted a ghost-writing job for a former British MP.  He is attractive, but doesn't overwhelm you with his charm.  This is no James Bond, and we like him a lot for his sort of vulnerable heroic qualities.Pierce Brosnan is appropriately creepy as the PM, who used to be an actor back at Yale and Cambridge, and uses his talents in the political arena. Olivia Williams ('hope I got her name right) is super as his Harvard/Cambridge educated wife, and the brains in the family.  She is so funny and smart and pathetic and strong, in turn, that you want to root for her to get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress next year.  (I hope they remember her.)I thought Kim Cattrell was very good, too, as the PM's hyper-efficient assistant, and mistress.  Her accent may have wavered a bit but she had the attitude nailed down.  She's actually very funny.  There are brief appearances by a number of well known actors, not the least of whom is Eli Wallach.  They all add to the fun of the film, although this is not intended to be a funny film.The dialogue is very smart, but again it doesn't overwhelm you with its cleverness.  Polanksi shows brilliance, subtlety and restraint in every aspect of the film, including the murky, menacing, seaside where most of the action takes place.

The PM of the story is now retired on an island off Massachusetts, like Martha's Vineyard, although I don't remember it actually being named. The island is only reached by ferry. The ghost writing job was started by another writer who has died, mysteriously falling off the ferry to the island. Did he commit suicide?  The house where the PM, his estranged wife Ruth, and staff headed by tart mouthed assistant Amelia played by Kim Cattrall (Sex in the City), seems less a home and more a fortress, or a bunker with armed guards. I guess that is what is needed today. The concrete and steel house and the lonely, desolate island with sand and oatgrass, wind, the gray churning stormy skies are symbolic and materially contribute to a sense of gloom, oppression and menace throughout the movie. This mood is enhanced by the cameraman's consistent use of blue and green filters. The house, the environment, is a star of the movie, in a sense.The ""ghost"" is given a ludicrously short timeframe, first a month then two weeks to clean up the dead writers work and finish the bio. The PM seems rather reluctant to talk much which makes the writer's job all the more difficult. All involved seem to not want to fill in the bio gaps, they just want the ghost to hurry up and fix the phone book sized bio written by his predecessor. The ghost starts asking questions...Suddenly things turn ugly as protestors start to question the PM's involvement or complicity into Bush Administration policies Guantanamo, rendition, waterboarding, etc. The PM and other people in the bumker house seem to have a bumker mentality. The ghost takes a ride around the island to ask questions of locals and takes the ferry to the mainland to research some ambiguous statements and some pictures he finds. Are there people following him or is he being paranoid?Ex-patriot director Roman Polanski has made a deeply atmospheric movie in the old sense, Hitchcockian (as is mentioned elsewhere), a thoughtful, tense, topical mystery movie for adults, which is so much a rarity today. I will avoid comment on his legal problems and just say that he is a great director and I hope these problems end and he returns to this country and continues to make movies of this quality (like ""Chinatown"") rather than the mindless dreck Hollywood mostly cranks out today.

He travels to a gloomy seaside hideaway in America (supposed to be Martha's Vineyard -- the location they filmed Jaws -- though, due to Polanksi's legal problems, it was actually filmed in Germany) to meet the politican (and his wife), and attempt to rewrite the manuscript. As he is there, though, the story breaks that Lang is to be tried for war crimes in Iraq, and as he also finds (in the effects of his predecessor) evidence that there might have been CIA involvement in Lang's ascendency to the top.I thought this was actually excellent and can't believe the amount of 1 star reviews! (If you don't like slow films, watch something else!) The cinematography and atmosphere (lots of sombre, autumnul greys and browns, rainy beaches) and pacing were particularily impressive and reminded me somewhat of Wallander (the Branagh adaptations), but the film was also full of Polanksi's mischevious genius. I thought McGregor was compelling in the central role (it was through his characters admittance that he knew nothing about politics that helped draw me in more). Brosnan was uterlised to perfection (keeping him cleverly off camera for large portions of the film to retain an impersonal distance and power), as Adam Lang, hiding away in his designer bunker by the ocean, whilst his world fell apart. The rest of the cast were excellent too.I suppose people will see this in different ways. I'm seeing it as someone who loves Polanski's work, but who hasn't read the book. I'd reccomend this to anyone who likes Polanksi (or also Wallander). It's nothing like Bourne (some people have mentioned it had the potential to be another Bourne) as it isn't supposed to be. It's about character and focuses on the increasing paranoia the Ghost Writer feels as his situation unfolds, on the psychological tension rather than the dramatic tension of being chased in different situations. Polanski doesn't achieve the heights of his own benchmark in paranoid isolation, Repulsion, but this is still a cut above your average thriller. It's a beautiful and haunting film with a strong plot and top notch acting and direction.

1328685,A3L3OKIPMLGAUK,B0036TGSR6,Ricardo C.,"[4, 5]","Roman Polanski's The Ghost Writer is a great thriller in the vein of Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much or North by Northwest; This is a god send due the garbage being made today.Ewan McGregor stars as a writer who replaces a recently deceased ""ghost writer"" who was working on the memoirs of a contriversal former British Prime Minister named Adam Lang, played in good spirit by Pierce Brosnan. Mc Gregor's character was brilliantly written because you feel his place in the world as an anonymous person, you actually never learn his name during the entire film. McGregor gets caught up in Lang's quest to not only preserve his legacy for prosperity but also fight political scandal; The film shows the power of words in the game of politics and in an ego-maniac's case, it never ends.I also adore the settings of the film, everything is purposely cold and disdant and McGregor is essentially swimming in shark infested waters and never knows where the danger comes from. One of Polanski's great trade marks is always to have the main protagonist caught in sort of an existential box in which the character can't seem to escape.The film builds to a gripping climax when Mcgregor investigates Lang's possible connections to the CIA and is hunted down by people who don't want him to find out; At one point a brilliantly staged low-speed chase occurs.

1328686,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0036TGSR6,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 3]","Polanski is one of the greatest film makers alive.  Beyond the perfect details and intricate stories, most of his films add new possibilities to the genres he operates in.  He re-made the film noire with China Town, introducing characters with far greater depth than in typical whodunnits, complete with an explosive political situation that ended in tragedy.  Now with this political thriller, in which an everyman finds himself in an extraordinary situation like Cary Grant in N by NW, Polanski again deepens the themes with tragedy, romance, and distrust.  There are so many levels to this film that I will be able to watch innumerable times and always see more.  It is some of the best film work available.The plot involves a ghost writer who is hired to fix the memoires of Lang, a Blair-like figure who recently has left power.  The original ghost writer, who washed up on shore dead and full of alcohol, was Lang's most trusted aide.  The new ghost is a political naif, extremely skilled at helping non-writers to find a story line, but largely ignorant of the world of national security and spies.  Upon investigation, he finds discrepancies in what Lang is telling him:  dates don't match up, the narrative makes little sense, and the tension in Lang's temporary residence is palpable.  Lang's wife, a first-rate politico and extraordinarily beautiful middle-aged woman, is extremely bitter at the affair that he is having with a younger aide.  When charges of violating international law brings protestors to the remote island, the ghost finds some strange documents by chance, setting him on a different path of investigation - which he is not there to do.  Needless to say,  he enters very dangerous teritory almost unawares, until he begins to fear for his own life.Behind this are wonderfully fecund themes.  Lang, as played by Brosnin, is a fascinating figure:  at once left-leaning and charismatic, he is also manipulative and enigmatic, perhaps a lier or worse.  You cannot trust anything he says, but his presence is commanding and decisive.  It is a study of a leader who is out and what happens once their secrets are no longer protected by their office.  Then there is his wife, whose subtle intelligence and guile are hidden behind her bitterness and seemingly pure motives to work as her husband's most trusted advisor.  She feels betrayed and is perhaps seeking revenge, yet appears lonely and betrayed, abandoned after a lifetime of devoted marriage.  She too may not be what the viewer is led to think.  The ghost is clearly out of his league, yet cannot help himself from getting dangerously enmeshed as events gather momentum.Polanski's handling of the situation is so deft that the viewer can be deceived, in my opinion.  Sure, the ghost figures out a version of what is going on and pays for it, but is it the whole story?  It is impossible to know.  What is clear is that he stupidly overplays his hand rather than waits for the right moment as only a pol would know how to do.  I write this cryptically because I don't want to reveal the surprises in store for the attentive viewer.This is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen.  The mood throughout is one of melancholy and bewilderment from the ghost's point of view, of gathering forces so far beyond his comprehension that he appears stupid.

1328691,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0036TGSR6,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","Offering a near-perfect blend of mystery, politics and human drama, the riveting and sublime ""The Ghost Writer"" is one of the most thought-provoking, intriguing and elegantly directed films of 2010.The story begins when an unnamed author (he is a ""ghost"" writer, after all), expertly played by Ewan McGregor, receives a quarter-million dollar offer to ghost-write a biography of ex-British Prime Minister, Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), who's currently residing on an island off Martha's Vineyard and whose previous collaborator's body mysteriously washed ashore a few months back, an apparent victim of alcohol-poisoning.  Not long after McGregor's arrival on the island, Lang is charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity - primarily rendition and torture - which puts the young, largely apolitical, writer in an awkward position to say the least.  McGregor's official duties as ghost writer for the autobiography take a back seat as he suddenly finds himself plunged into a thrilling round of cloak-and-dagger espionage.  And what he finds is far more than he bargained for when he initially took on the assignment - namely, an intricately-spun web of military-industrial-complex intrigue that leads to the highest echelons of world leadership.Further complicating McGregor's life is Ruth (Olivia Williams), Lang's beautiful, world-weary and cynical wife who's torn between a desire to protect her husband from political harm and her own personal disgust for the man.The events in the movie - which was adapted by Robert Harris and director Roman Polanski from Harris' novel ""The Ghost"" - feel as though they`ve been ripped straight out of today`s headlines.  It's certainly not hard to see a thinly-veiled Tony Blair in the character of Lang, a British leader who serves mainly to do the bidding of the United States government and the CIA.  McGregor's author is the classic Everyman character - a mere cipher but with a basic sense of decency - who finds himself suddenly thrust into the midst of a life-or-death drama, wanting to do the right thing but all too aware of the power that this Goliath he's up against has to do him harm.This stylish and topical movie has been paced for maximum effectiveness, seamlessly interweaving scenes of breath bating suspense with lyrical moments of quiet reflection.  As director, Polanski makes the dreary and windswept seaside setting an integral part of the drama, and Alexandre Desplat's score, heavy on the strings, echoes Bernard Herrmann at his finest.The performances are brilliant throughout, with Timothy Hutton, Jim Belushi and Eli Wallach making memorable cameo appearances at crucial moments in the drama.With a stunning climax that will leave you reeling, ""The Ghost Writer"" may well be the finest and most beautifully made thriller in ages.",5,Superb political thriller,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2825,"['Offering', 'near-perfect', 'blend', 'mystery', 'politics', 'human', 'drama', 'riveting', 'sublime', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'one', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'intriguing', 'elegantly', 'directed', 'films', '2010.The', 'story', 'begins', 'when', 'unnamed', 'author', 'ghost', 'writer', 'expertly', 'played', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'quarter-million', 'dollar', 'offer', 'ghost-write', 'biography', 'ex-British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Adam', 'Lang', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'currently', 'residing', 'island', 'off', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'previous', 'collaborator', 'body', 'mysteriously', 'washed', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'apparent', 'victim', 'alcohol-poisoning', 'Not', 'long', 'McGregor', 'arrival', 'island', 'Lang', 'charged', 'International', 'Criminal', 'Court', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'primarily', 'rendition', 'torture', 'young', 'largely', 'apolitical', 'writer', 'awkward', 'position', 'say', 'least', 'McGregor', 'official', 'duties', 'ghost', 'writer', 'autobiography', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'suddenly', 'plunged', 'thrilling', 'round', 'cloak-and-dagger', 'espionage', 'what', 'far', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'initially', 'took', 'assignment', 'namely', 'intricately-spun', 'web', 'military-industrial-complex', 'intrigue', 'highest', 'echelons', 'world', 'leadership.Further', 'complicating', 'McGregor', 'life', 'Ruth', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Lang', 'beautiful', 'world-weary', 'cynical', 'wife', 'who', 'torn', 'desire', 'protect', 'husband', 'political', 'harm', 'own', 'personal', 'disgust', 'man.The', 'events', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'Robert', 'Harris', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Harris', 'novel', 'Ghost', 'feel', 've', 'been', 'ripped', 'straight', 'today', 's', 'headlines', 'certainly', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'thinly-veiled', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'character', 'Lang', 'British', 'leader', 'who', 'mainly', 'do', 'bidding', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'CIA', 'McGregor', 'author', 'classic', 'Everyman', 'character', 'mere', 'cipher', 'basic', 'sense', 'decency', 'who', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'midst', 'life-or-death', 'drama', 'wanting', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'too', 'aware', 'power', 'Goliath', 'up', 'do', 'harm.This', 'stylish', 'topical', 'movie', 'been', 'paced', 'maximum', 'effectiveness', 'seamlessly', 'interweaving', 'scenes', 'breath', 'bating', 'suspense', 'lyrical', 'moments', 'quiet', 'reflection', 'director', 'Polanski', 'dreary', 'windswept', 'seaside', 'setting', 'integral', 'part', 'drama', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'score', 'heavy', 'strings', 'echoes', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'finest.The', 'performances', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'making', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'crucial', 'moments', 'drama.With', 'stunning', 'climax', 'will', 'leave', 'reeling', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'finest', 'most', 'beautifully', 'made', 'thriller', 'ages']",N/A

It is also satisfying to British subjects who have felt resentful towards their declining power in the Anglo-American alliance.Several well-known American and British actors were happy to appear in Polanski's feature.  They are generally well-cast - with the exception of Kim Catrall, who is a British/Canadian citizen, yet has an oddly unconvincing British accent.  Meanwhile overused British actor Tom Wilkenson does a workmanlike job as an American conspirator.  Fired Bond Pierce Brosnan appears as a caricature of Tony Blair.As political thrillers go, The Ghost Writer is as obvious as many others.  Its quality is mainly judged through the prism of ones' political convictions. It doesn't seek to convert, but rather to stroke old prejudices.  If more Americans bothered to see it, no doubt they would be offended.  There's simultaneously an American faction who is equally dissatisfied with Washington's close relationship with London.

1328693,A387BD735MI50R,B0036TGSR6,R. Schultz,"[1, 3]","This movie has the same feel as the high-tension ""Torn Curtain,"" the classic Hitchcock thriller starring Paul Newman and Julie Andrews. Like that earlier film, this one plummets a civilian into international intrigue where he is left to shift for himself. He has to use all his ingenuity and wiles to evade the conspiracy that he feels taking shape around him. He senses danger at every turn, but since he isn't sure what door it's coming in through, he can't be sure which door to leave by.There are major stars in this film who play their parts brilliantly. Tom Wilkinson is chilling in his portrayal of civilized menace. Pierce Brosnan does a wonderful job as the ex-Prime Minister whose hearty manner increasingly seems to be a mask he wears to hide ruthlessness.The only problem is - the stakes in this game are hardly high enough to warrant all the characters' sinister maneuvering. In ""Torn Curtain,"" Newman and Andrews were up against the concerted forces of the deadly Cold War competition. Secrets about new atomic weapons were at stake. Here the forces being arrayed against Ewan McGregor's character are motivated by a desire to either make or break the ex-Prime Minister's reputation. One faction is working to make a cause celebre of his orders to have four suspected terrorists water-boarded in order to force them to reveal their connections. The opposing faction is working to cover-up this ugly aspect of his regime in order to protect his place in history and his Party's chances in the next round of elections.Ordering the torture of detainees is certainly reprehensible, but it's hardly the stuff of international intrigue. As McGregor makes his way through this contrived danger and tries to ghost write an autobiography for the ex-Prime Minister that is neither a fluff piece nor unintentionally incriminating - he does begin to find that the over-shadowing conspiracy has a root system larger than the single issue of the treatment of detainees. But this larger issue turns out to supply an even less convincing reason for murderous plotting. This international game of poker with nothing convincing at stake then devolves into a completely trumped up exercise.Without Nazis or KGB, or without directly invoking terrorist infiltration - modern political thrillers have a hard time conjuring up realistic threats. So this movie is a snow globe, a shining example of acting, dialogue, and cinematography, all encasing a harmless miniature of motive. But if you can just imagine those bygone blocs and inject some sense of the threat they posed into this plot, you can enjoy the craft of this film.Plus, it has an authentically inventive, poignant ending.",4,"Taut, Intriguing",1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,2676,"['movie', 'same', 'feel', 'high-tension', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'classic', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'earlier', 'film', 'one', 'civilian', 'international', 'intrigue', 'where', 'left', 'shift', 'use', 'ingenuity', 'wiles', 'evade', 'conspiracy', 'taking', 'shape', 'danger', 'turn', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'coming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'door', 'leave', 'are', 'major', 'stars', 'film', 'who', 'play', 'parts', 'brilliantly', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'chilling', 'portrayal', 'civilized', 'menace', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'wonderful', 'job', 'ex-Prime', 'Minister', 'hearty', 'manner', 'increasingly', 'be', 'mask', 'hide', 'ruthlessness.The', 'only', 'problem', 'stakes', 'game', 'are', 'hardly', 'high', 'enough', 'warrant', 'characters', 'sinister', 'maneuvering', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'Newman', 'Andrews', 'were', 'up', 'concerted', 'forces', 'deadly', 'Cold', 'War', 'competition', 'Secrets', 'new', 'atomic', 'weapons', 'were', 'stake', 'Here', 'forces', 'being', 'arrayed', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'character', 'are', 'motivated', 'desire', 'make', 'break', 'ex-Prime', 'Minister', 'reputation', 'One', 'faction', 'working', 'make', 'cause', 'celebre', 'orders', 'have', 'four', 'suspected', 'terrorists', 'water-boarded', 'order', 'force', 'reveal', 'connections', 'opposing', 'faction', 'working', 'cover-up', 'ugly', 'aspect', 'regime', 'order', 'protect', 'place', 'history', 'Party', 'chances', 'next', 'round', 'elections.Ordering', 'torture', 'detainees', 'certainly', 'reprehensible', 'hardly', 'stuff', 'international', 'intrigue', 'McGregor', 'way', 'contrived', 'danger', 'tries', 'ghost', 'write', 'autobiography', 'ex-Prime', 'Minister', 'fluff', 'piece', 'unintentionally', 'incriminating', 'begin', 'find', 'over-shadowing', 'conspiracy', 'root', 'system', 'larger', 'single', 'issue', 'treatment', 'detainees', 'larger', 'issue', 'out', 'supply', 'even', 'less', 'convincing', 'reason', 'murderous', 'plotting', 'international', 'game', 'poker', 'nothing', 'convincing', 'stake', 'then', 'completely', 'trumped', 'up', 'exercise.Without', 'Nazis', 'KGB', 'directly', 'invoking', 'terrorist', 'infiltration', 'modern', 'political', 'thrillers', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'conjuring', 'up', 'realistic', 'threats', 'So', 'movie', 'snow', 'globe', 'shining', 'example', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'cinematography', 'encasing', 'harmless', 'miniature', 'motive', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'bygone', 'blocs', 'inject', 'sense', 'threat', 'posed', 'plot', 'can', 'enjoy', 'craft', 'film.Plus', 'authentically', 'inventive', 'poignant', 'ending']",N/A

Ewan McGregor leads a top-notch cast through the twists and turns of an interesting, atmospheric flick.McGregor plays a quality hack writer who gets the offer of a lifetime - $250,000 to ghost write the memoirs of Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), a former British PM in the mold of Tony Blair (well, we presume that when Tony Blair looks in a mirror, he sees Pierce Brosnan in the reflection).  Lang has left office under a cloud of scandal as his government is accused of rendering British citizens to torture-friendly countries as part of the War on Terror.

By now I suspect McGregor has a clause in every contract that stipulates million dollar fines from the producers unless the actor is allowed to flash us on film. Cheeky sod!Back on topic:Former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is staying on Nantucket, writing his memoirs. When a body is fished out of the sea near Lang's house, it turns out to be that of his ghost writer. The death is quickly pronounced a suicide and a new ghost writer is dispatched. Enter Ewan McGregor (still fully clothed at this point). The man quickly realizes not all is well in the house of Lang. Dead body, witness in a coma, group of seemingly innocent photographs carefully hidden under the dead man's sock drawer... Lots of questions, few answers. Alas, once The Ghost Writer makes the decision to step foot on the path of discovery, he cannot turn back. The unfolding events promise a sinister conclusion, and do not disappoint...The tense story is courtesy of a book by the British journalist Robert Harris. The book caused a bit of a stir upon its publication back in the UK as the character of Adam Lang is clearly made in the image of the actual former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The insinuations the author makes about the ex-Prime Minister and his possible involvement with the CIA are so preposterous they cannot be believed. According to Harris, the low probability of the events was the very reason he avoided being sued by Blair. And yet, the suggestions are so deliciously scandalous, some part of us cannot help but wish they were true... Harris and Polanski, the film's director, expertly transformed the book into a script.

True enough, so long as the demography of the adults, does not extend beyond the borderline juvenile.That sniping, aside, Roman Polanski and writing partner Robert Harris, could have added substantially more beef, beyond that which was barely alluded to (the brief discussion between Adam Lang and the ghost writer on the short flight back to Island, just before Adam Lang is assassinated)), without too much extra effort.

Polanski is a master.On the surface, it's about a Tony Blair-like British Prime Minister and his questionable support for the Iraq War. That the movie wasn't a big hit had more to do with its controversial subject than the story itself, which vividly unfolds much like the dark, classic, allegorical cautionary tale told in the book, THE GHOST, by Robert Harris.The world-weary ghost-writer thinks he's seen it all, having ghost-written numerous books for celebrities. He knows how to turn a boring or sordid bio into a fascinating, inspiring bio. But as this story progresses, he begins to suspect he doesn't know the half of it. And in the end, what he uncovers tragically demonstrates his true naivet&eacute;.Author Harris uses various plot devices that serve to have the 'ghost' of the dead former ghost-writer guide the new ghost-writer along the trail that led to his mysterious death. The use of the SUV's GPS system to lead the ghost-writer to those responsible is pure brilliance. If it seems simple to some, it's nevertheless an effective allegorical device that carries the viewer ever deeper into the mystery.The ending is sadly ironic, inexorable and prophetic, like a great allegories often are, and it's lesson is as wry as it is bitter.In the hands of the great Roman Polanski, who gave us CHINATOWN, the film is as artful as it is captivating.",5,Another Polanski Masterpiece,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,1396,"['beautifully', 'crafted', 'film', 'Polanski', 'master.On', 'surface', 'Tony', 'Blair-like', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'questionable', 'support', 'Iraq', 'War', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'hit', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'controversial', 'subject', 'story', 'vividly', 'much', 'dark', 'classic', 'allegorical', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'told', 'book', 'GHOST', 'Robert', 'Harris.The', 'world-weary', 'ghost-writer', 'thinks', 'seen', 'having', 'ghost-written', 'numerous', 'books', 'celebrities', 'how', 'turn', 'boring', 'sordid', 'bio', 'fascinating', 'inspiring', 'bio', 'story', 'suspect', ""n't"", 'know', 'half', 'end', 'what', 'tragically', 'true', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'Harris', 'various', 'plot', 'devices', 'serve', 'have', ""'ghost"", 'dead', 'former', 'ghost-writer', 'guide', 'new', 'ghost-writer', 'trail', 'led', 'mysterious', 'death', 'use', 'SUV', 'GPS', 'system', 'lead', 'ghost-writer', 'responsible', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'simple', 'nevertheless', 'effective', 'allegorical', 'device', 'viewer', 'ever', 'mystery.The', 'ending', 'sadly', 'ironic', 'inexorable', 'prophetic', 'great', 'allegories', 'often', 'are', 'lesson', 'as', 'wry', 'hands', 'great', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'who', 'gave', 'CHINATOWN', 'film', 'as', 'artful', 'captivating']",N/A
1328712,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B0036TGSR6,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[2, 4]","Movie - 4.5I know the name Roman Polanski, but I'm embarrassed to say this is only the first film of his I've ever seen. My curiosity for this movie was nudged after hearing his name and the names of some very fine actors being involved, namely: Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, and Tom Wilkinson. In watching The Ghost Writer, I had gone in expecting some sort of political thriller along the lines of State of Play (the last political thriller I saw and really, really liked); something with a lot of twists, turns, and deception from every which way until a shocking resolution was reached. Instead, I was completely surprised with a good deal of British charm, wit, and whimsicality involved, and then a little dazzle in the discovery of one Mr. Polanski's talent. The Ghost Writer is, indeed, a thriller that managed to captivate and keep me guessing what would happen next, but in a very odd manner. Usually, when watching political thrillers, or thrillers in general, I've always had this ""expectancy of complexity"" factor in which I just about always expected the unexpected to happen, and often. But in experiencing this film, I was surprised at how it achieved the same effect, though in much less flashy theatrics and writing. From the very beginning, we know someone is dead, this ghost is assigned to finish the memoirs of a controversial former Prime Minister, and that things just logically snowball deeper and deeper into conspiracy. However, what surprised me the most was at how well-ground and down-to-earth the screenplay felt. It was very simple in nature, and not at all what I was expecting, and yet I couldn't help but become more and more intrigued by the mysteries that lied therein until everything came to revelation, and the movie was over just as the symbolism of the ghost implies. If Polanski was always this good, then I apologize up-front that I never bothered to discover him in the first place. The drama, sleuthing, and pacing were very enjoyable.Video - 5.0You wouldn't think a political thriller would make for much reference-level material, but don't let the generalization fool you. The Ghost Writer looks stunning on BD with a perfect transfer whose simplicity in writing is as deceptively commendable as its photography. Colors offer a wide selection of vibrancy throughout the various locations, sets, and costumes. And as plain as they are, flawless picture reproduction is still flawless. Black levels are deep and equally without fault, providing for some excellent foreshadowing as the film progresses. And speaking of shadows, line/shadow delineation is some of the best I've seen in recent memory (in relation to recent films). There were parts of the movie when McGregor would be sitting and reading in the dark, and the level of depth between his silhouette, the shadows behind him, and the natural lighting from the screen were ridiculously accurate and separated from one another. Contrast and lighting benefit from this very much as well, as apparent in the very fine skin and cloth detail from the gray hairs on Brosnan's head, to the fibers of a bath robe, to the stretch (or plastic surgery) marks on Kim Cattrall's body (have to say, though, she looks pretty good for 54). Sharpness is razor sharp and presents the overall photography with a kind of subtlety worthy of Blu-ray and the hype that comes along with its label of ""pristine picture."" This is definitely a winner, and should get at least an Oscar nomination for cinematography.Audio - 4.5Again, political thrillers don't usually instill that, ""wow, that's going to sound awesome,"" kind of feeling, but this movie just kept surprising me. Dialogue sounds perfect through the center and all (don't know how anyone can screw that up), and the script/acting come off very well to help the carry the plot. My biggest surprise, though, is in the score. Alexandre Desplat's compositions completely caught me off guard. They're not bad or anything, but the instrumentation and overall ambiance just really kept me into the film for some reason. It'd be something tense and suspenseful at one moment with a bunch of strings, and then all of a sudden transition into an almost goofy set of drums, woodwinds, and brass that, strangely, still had the right sense of setting a tone. I really don't know how to explain the feeling I got from his work, but it seemed off, yet oddly satisfying. As for sound effects, a lot of it is left to a particular kind of ambiance as well. The effects are relatively just there in the background, like cars driving on gravel, rainfall, ocean waves, the wind, or various creaks and taps on the furniture, but it makes for a great mix, regardless of their frivolities. I think my subwoofer went to standby once or twice from the inactivity of LFEs, so that should be pretty self-explanatory. For a film like this, though, you don't really need them.Extras - 3.5Not a whole lot of special features here other than an interview with the author of the original novel, Robert Harris (who is also the screenwriter for the film), interviews with the four main actors in what they thought about working with Polanski, and then an interview with Polanski himself, all of which are presented in HD. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that, while the extras themselves don't amount to much in terms of quantity (just under 30 minutes), I still very much enjoyed the quality of them, mainly because this is the only thing I've ever come to see or hear about in relation to Roman Polanski and the notoriety that comes with his name as a director. From what I've heard about him, I get this image that he's a highly-renowned and very well-respected director that's something of an icon in the industry. And after hearing these comments about him, I'd even go to say the general consensus is to call him a sort of living legend. From his demeanor and the quality of work shown in this film, I can certainly see why he's earned a lot of this praise, and I'm very curious to play catchup on his career now. With that being said, I thought the extras also helped to add a decent amount of depth to the characters, plot, and filming process, though obviously they could've been longer or more fully-explained. I also would've loved to have heard an audio commentary by Polanski and Harris for the film, but too bad, I guess. Despite these shortcomings, I was pleased to be enlightened about Polanski's image in general.Overall - 4.5The Ghost Writer certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's a thriller, yes, but it's nowhere near as fancy or flashy as a gangster, cop, or espionage entry into the genre. It's a much more simplistic, logical, almost humdrum kind of thriller filled with witty characters and tout dialogue, but could still be entertaining if you're in to this type of film. I'd never seen a Polanski film till now, but I'm proud to say I'm damn curious to see some more. With reference video, near-reference audio, and a pretty short, though very informative, set of extras (for me, anyway), I highly recommend this BD for fans of the movie. Others may want to give it a rent to see if it fits their preferences, first.",5,The Ghost Writer (Blu-ray),1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,7184,"['Movie', '4.5I', 'know', 'name', 'Roman', 'Polanski',

1328714,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0036TGSR6,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Five years after the faithful but bland adaption of ""Oliver Twist,"" Roman Polanski came back with a political thriller ""The Ghost Writer."" Reading the positive reviews and praises heaped upon the film, some quoting the name of Hitchcock, my expectation was high. Now I saw the film, and I don't know what to say. Acting is mostly effective, and so is the dark photography. But I am afraid that Polanski takes the preposterous storyline too seriously.Polanski's political thriller is about a British ghost writer played by Ewan McGregor, who takes over the job of writing memoirs of former UK Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) when his predecessor was found dead on the beach. The unnamed protagonist flies to Martha's Vineyard, where Lang, being accused of a war crime, has been staying with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and his assistant Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). While working on the project, the ghost writer stumbles upon possible clues that might suggest foul play.It's not a bad opening, and the film's gloomy atmosphere is something you shouldn't miss, but the convoluted storyline has so many plot holes. The stories of Hitchcock's thrillers were often contrived, but at least they tried to stay within the bounds of plausibility. If the titular ghost writer really believes the ""secret"" he finds, (helped by several lucky coincidences and Google), and tells the whole world about it, who would believe it? Do you?Of course, some might argue the film is not just about suspense. It can be, say, meditation on the elusiveness of truth. But when the ""truth"" is something too incredible, why should we take the film seriously. Strangely, however, that is exactly what ""The Ghost Writer"" wants us to, with its very political aspects which I don't discuss here. Whatever the film is, it is slick and stylish.

1328715,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0036TGSR6,Turfseer,"[8, 18]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I was disappointed in 'The Ghost Writer' since Roman Polanski did such a fine job with the excellent Holocaust drama, 'The Pianist'. What could have possessed Polanski to choose his material from 'The Ghost', a cheap shot novel from hack writer Robert Harris? The answer is obvious: Polanski has a grudge against the United States since they barred him from returning after he was accused of raping an underage girl back in the 70s.'The Ghost Writer' starts off rather nicely. A car on a ferry remains unclaimed after all the other cars have driven off. We soon find out that the car belonged to Mike McAra, a long-term assistant of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). Mike is found dead, washed up on Martha's Vineyard beach where Lang has been vacationing with his wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams). Lang's assistant was helping him write his memoirs and now Lang's publishing company must hire a ghost writer to help the former Prime Minister complete the manuscript.The ghost writer (who remains unnamed throughout the movie and is referred to as 'The Ghost') is played by Ewan McGregor who arrives on Martha's Vineyard in the midst of a burgeoning scandal. It seems that the International Court at the Hague has accused Lang of ordering the torture of suspected terrorists while he was in office. Novelist Harris failed to do his research regarding legal protocol/regulations at the Hague. According to Wikipedia, ""handing British citizens over to the CIA to be tortured (in one case to death) -- would probably not be deemed a war crime or a crime against humanity by the International Criminal Court, as the acts were not ""committed as part of a policy that is executed on a wide scale"". In the DVD commentary, Harris admits he got the torture idea from watching a news report. Is this really the most original and clever idea that could have been utilized to propel the story along?While Harris admits that Lang has some attributes of the real-life Tony Blair, he denies that his character is supposed to be a model for the former Prime Minister. Whether he's the model or not, one thing remains clear: both Harris and Polanski blame Blair for his association with George Bush, who is linked to accusations of torture of prisoners. To my mind, I always thought that Tony Blair was a liberal/progressive, but the association with Bush not only sullies his reputation in the eyes of these militant left-wingers, but turns him into some kind of war criminal. At least Harris/Polanski allow their Blair stand-in, Lang, to defend himself from the outrageous implication that he is a war criminal but the subsequent turns in the plot point to where their true sympathies lie.McGregor's ghostwriter begins uncovering clues, possibly left by Lang's predecessor in the manuscript itself, that Lang is linked to the CIA. It appears that the CIA already is aware that there is some kind of secret code in the book, but they're either watching the ghostwriter to make sure he doesn't figure it out or allowing him to uncover the code for them. That's why so many unlikely events occur: Mike's room remains uncleaned and not searched and the Ghost finds some pictures of Lang from his days at Cambridge in the 70s, leading to clues that he may be associated with the CIA; The Ghost so easily finds his way to Emmet's house as the GPS is still programmed in the car; The Ghost so easily escapes from the clutches of two men who have been following in a car; and the assassin so easily is able to assassinate Lang despite the security protection (the implication is that the CIA makes a deal with the bitter father, who blames Lang for his son's death, allowing him access to the terminal roof).Perhaps the weakest part of 'The Ghost Writer' is the idea that the Ghost uncovers Emmet's association with the CIA merely by googling him on the internet. Big secret! And then there's the ridiculous finale where Amelia informs the Ghost, echoing opposition leader Rycart's earlier revelation, that ""it's all there at the beginning"". The Ghost figures it out that Lady MacBeth-like 'Ruth' is a CIA agent and has been influencing her husband for years. It turns out Lang is merely a 'patsy' and initially doesn't accept Mike's warning that Ruth has been up no good. Later, the Ghost reveals to Lang on the plane that Mike betrayed him, by telling Rycart about Ruth.The idiotic belief that the CIA uniformly consists of a bunch of cold-blooded murderers is reflective of the anti-American attitude in Europe today. Accusations of conspiracies are thick in the air despite no proof whatsoever. And here in 'The Ghost Writer', the CIA, in the form of a Machiavellian woman, will stoop to murder at any cost. If you are unable to refrain from bashing the CIA, it might be better to view them not as sinister characters, but more as a bunch of ineffectual bureaucrats, whose main source of 'intelligence', is what they can garner (along with anyone else) from the internet.Due to the prohibition of Polanski being allowed back in the U.S., most of the exterior shots were filmed in Germany. Polanski manages to extract some decent performances from his actors (although Kim Cattall's so-called British accent, has some rough patches). The problem with 'The Ghost Writer' is not in its characters or even its smart dialogue. Rather, it suffers from an incredible and ludicrous plot coupled with that anti-American sensibility. Behind it all is a naive Utopian presumption that we can all get along despite the presence of international terrorism--that is, a group of people who are bent on destroying all those who don't conform to their radical, fanatical ideology.",2,Polanski adapts hack novelist's work to advance anti-American agenda,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,5704,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain',

Kim Cattrell's character didn't make much sense. I didn't care for any of the characters and the denouement was interesting but the ending just fell flat to me (like McGregor's body).

1328720,AH64XXZBL1T6Z,B0036TGSR6,Yaakov (James) Mosher,"[2, 4]","Sure not to be included at any American Enterprise Institute (read: neoconservative) awards banquet or used as a CIA recruitment film, Roman Polanski is at his realpolitick best with ""The Ghost Writer.""Ewan McGregor plays ""The Ghost"" very well. We hear his actual name early in the film but Polanski cleverly makes us forget it after McGregor's character claims to have no family and is repeatedly called ""man"" by his client - former British Prime Minister Adam Lange (played by Pierce Bosnan). Brosnan plays the dodgy pol to a tee, showing us that political thrillers may be his cuppa tea. It's Brosnan's best movie work since ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" (Sorry, Pierce, but Daniel Craig and Timothy Dalton are better at playing James Bond).Polanski neatly hides the underlying problem in plain sight - The British PM's name resembles that of the headquarters of a foreign intelligence service. This is Polanski taking a John le Carre-esqe poke at Tony Blair and his Cool Britainnia and its kneeling posture vis a vi W. Bush's U.S. during the Iraq War. Think: Blair House in Washington isn't named after Tony Blair but it ought to be.As always, Polanski's room of ideas and history is handsomely furnished. He pays tribute to past espionage thrillers in casting Timothy Hutton (""The Falcon and The Snowman"") as Lange's lawyer. We recall Polanski's masterpiece - ""Chinatown"" - when the great Eli Wallach (""The Two Jakes"") steps out from behind the door of an old sea shack. The curve-ball ending of ""The Ghost Writer"" isn't on par with ""Chinatown"" but it's compelling nonetheless.The writer/director even manages a rehabilitation of the non-partisan press. The Ghost represents the faceless print media that Rush Limbaugh and friends love to complain about but couldn't live without. On behalf of those not likely to become a Woodward and/or Bernstein we thank you, Roman.The Richard Rycart character bears a strong resemblance to Robin Cook, a minister sacked by Blair for not being sufficiently pro-American. If this film gets London to reassess ""the special relationship"" then John Bull-y for the UK.Polanski also has a veiled message for Jews and Israelis in that the person pulling Lange's strings has the same name as a revered historical figure that converted to Judaism and became, as it were, more Jewish than the ""regular"" Jews themselves. A beautiful story that but also a teaching about zeal applicable to today's Middle East. Interestingly, Polanski gives this person's recruiter the same name as the most famous Jewish convert to Christianity, a point that Christians and especially Christian Zionists should reflect on.The lesson is for Jews and Israelis to put their faith in what Russell Kirk called the permanent things (G-d and Torah) and that perpetual conversion to Americanism is a recipe for trouble with Arabs and Muslims. The Holy Land will find peace by being a multiethnic spiritual crossroads (""My House shall be a house for all peoples,"" G-d told Isaiah) and not as The Jewish State or as Little Apartheid America.But just as you're ready to join Israel's Peace Now movement, Polanski reverses field with some Kissinger-type wisdom - Lange's rant to The Ghost about airport security while they're flying on Lange's private jet (the former PM's near last words) should be taken seriously.Polanski's message sounds notes from Ernst Mach's intellectual symphony - the world is always as we find it at that given instant and we can't wish that away.
