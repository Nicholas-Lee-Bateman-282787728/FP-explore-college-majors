1157948,AUJEF31CXWTCQ,B0017VG60E,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","Six Reasons Why is a Western/Fantasy amalgamation, which you could easily call a cross between Stephen King's The Gunslinger, and the spaghetti western, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. On many levels, this movie thrives and succeeds. The cinematography is brilliant for such a low budget flick, and the story telling is paced well. There are no lulls or dead spots, and no unnecessary scenes or dialogue. It is this bare bones story telling style that holds your attention, and ultimately carries Six Reasons Why into the realm of a memorable film. The one thing holding this film back from reaching its potential is acting. While the acting is often very serviceable, it often wavers on the over-dramatic side, and occasionally, albeit infrequently, crumbles into mediocrity. If you like King's Gunslinger, or are a fan of spaghetti westerns, Six Reasons Why is worth viewing.",4,The Gunslinger meets Spaghetti Westerns,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,877,"['Six', 'Reasons', 'Why', 'Western/Fantasy', 'amalgamation', 'could', 'easily', 'call', 'cross', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Gunslinger', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'many', 'levels', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'story', 'telling', 'paced', 'well', 'are', 'lulls', 'dead', 'spots', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'bare', 'bones', 'story', 'telling', 'style', 'attention', 'ultimately', 'Six', 'Reasons', 'Why', 'realm', 'memorable', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'holding', 'film', 'back', 'reaching', 'potential', 'acting', 'acting', 'often', 'very', 'serviceable', 'often', 'over-dramatic', 'side', 'occasionally', 'albeit', 'infrequently', 'crumbles', 'mediocrity', 'like', 'King', 'Gunslinger', 'are', 'fan', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'Six', 'Reasons', 'Why', 'worth', 'viewing']",Six Reasons Why

The story is about a wandering desperado who, while riding a horse and carrying a six gun, is really living in the future. He's been given a quest by a preacher which is the hint that he's suppose to be a good guy out to get the bad guys in the bad lands. There wasn't any twist to that in mind. The film never grips you and the best thing that I can say is that since I rented this, I could turn it off without having to leave my seat. The acting is poor and the filming gives this movie more of an amateur feel than a indie film.

The camerawork is great, the scenery harsh but beautiful and the acting good but the story...  Was there one? At all?A town somewhere in a futuristic West periodically sends a young man into the Badlands surrounding it to act as a guard against others entering their territory. His only companion is a horse who must stay with him as long as he's alive. The current &#34;guardian&#34; has been there 12 years and wants nothing omre than to figure out a way to make the horse think he's dead so he can go home. (Nothing is made of the fact of what will happen if he does go home, because then it'll be obvious he's still alive.) He meets 3 strangers...the son of a man building a monorail for a place called New Gibralter, that man's killer, and the man who hired the killer...and that's more or less it.  The story of each man's background is told in flashback while they have their stand-off. There's a bit of an ironic twist at the end.At first glance and all thereafter, this film could pass for a spaghetti western in its heyday, making just about as much sense but with less violence. I was also reminded of Stephen King's The Gunslinger because of the dystopian elements.  The soundtrack is definitely a la The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly with vocal and whistling and one expects at any moment to hear that familiar bird-call heralding the beginning of that famous piece. The  Canadian scenery is harsh, beautiful, and alien-appearing.  The actors all have that very still, deep-voiced delivery which made me wonder at first if the dialogue was dubbed but everything appeared in sync and they were speaking English. Oh and the horse is a very beautiful, if interesting-looking, one who also gets billing credit.It had a lot going for it and could've been something great if there had only been more of a story. Unfortunately there wasn't. I'm still wavering on whether I liked it or not.
