And you probably will too, provided that you are up for an hilarious movie that is able to take a one-joke premise and turn it into nearly two hours of pure enjoyment. Sinbad and Phil Hartman are both outstanding: two hilarious entertainers doing what they do best - a pleasant comedy. Both are funny in their own ways, and both carry the movie's premise to make it completely harmless entertainment.There are tons of laughs along the way, once you accept the bizarre premise and don't question the plot details. It's a silly, feel-good comedy, and in that sense, it succeeds. Don't expect something that makes you think (although it will at points), don't expect something without physical comedy. For instance, there are some of the most poorly-written, dumbest slapstick gangsters in this film, and yet it doesn't make you dislike the movie.This movie most definitely deserves to be released on DVD, in widescreen. It's a funny romp that the whole family can enjoy, and will have you laughing a LOT more than the typical comedy release.

Sinbad is utterly hilarious and works harmoniously with Phil Hartman.It's about a man named Kevin Franklin (Sinbad), who owes money to a couple of loansharks. After threatening to kill Derek, he runs to an airport desperately trying to find a way to make it out of their alive, and happens to hear Gary Phil Hartman describing to his kids what his long-lost friend Derek Bond looks like, as they stand there waiting for him. Conveniently, Kevin happens to fit the description perfectly, and jumps up, taking on Derek Bond's identity.One of my favorite things about Sinbad comedy is that he is able to be extremely funny without being provocative. He doesn't rely in sex to sell, which is quite different from most comedians these days.If you read the back of the movie, you may think, ""Wow, this sounds like it has a lot of potential to be funny.

The dialogue sparkles, the direction isn't just 2-takes-and-go, the cinematography is whackily speeded up in some places and the editing is rapid fire. And unlike most family movies, it lasts for 110 minutes. That's about half an hour longer than is usual. I know this hardly seems like a valid point but I reckon it proves the movie's got more content than fart jokes etc.My only gripe is the obvious McDonalds plugging about 40 minutes in. If you can just turn away for these 10 seconds then it's not so bad. It's a shame that it's there tho because it tarnishes the credibility of the movie.Sinbad is always good and the late, great Phil Hartman can make any film watchable so they really add to this brilliantly entertaining comedy. Do yourself a favour and watch it. It's not just for kids. I watched my VHS a zillion times and I was so impatient for this DVD to be released.So it's barebones, but who cares? I'm just glad to have it. The 1.78:1 anamorphic picture is super and the Dolby 2.0 surround track is decent enough. After all this is a dialogue driven comedy but some sound effects and music are presented pretty well. My subwoofer even go a big kick from a gunshot near the end.Pick this one up whenever you see it.

In desperation at an airport, he assumes the identity of a man for whom a car is waiting at the airport. (Think in terms of the drivers at big airports holding up signs for the people they are supposed to pick up.)It turns out that he has assumed the identity of a man visiting a friend from college(Phil Hartman). They have not seen each other for many, many years so he is not recognized. Hartman has always talked about this friend and what a great guy he is but his family has never seen him Now they do meet him and put him up as a houseguest. It is only with much difficulty that Sinbad learns that he is supposed to be a famous dentist.He thinks quickly on his feet and even manages to pull of a complex dental procedure by accident. While he is saving himself, he manages to save the marriage of his ""friend"" , the love life of  their daughter, the sports life of the son and set the ""friend"" up for a new career.It is implausible at each step but Sinbad and Hartman work well together and they have fun.

Especially with all the arguing in the film between Phil's character's wife & him. It's kinda weird considering I had no idea who he was, but I instantly know his voice from the Simpsons as Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz. (Who does those voices now?) He's a miss.And how fun was Sinbad? He's a mixture of all the best comedic actors, but he puts his own spin on things. He was perfect in this film, up against Phil's uptight character.I found this film a bit slow to get started, but it was really got going after a while. It wasn't as exciting as it possibly could have been, but the actors playing the kids were actually quite good, apart from the wee boy. Someone kick him.The best scenes in the whole movie? Most definitely the scenes with the party & everyone getting drunk. Hilarious. There's plenty of laughs, and has a feel of Home Alone about it, except with an adult, rather than a kid.I have to say this isn't the kind of film I'd normally watch, but I'd definitely watch more Sinbad films in the future.

I like the theme of mistaken identity, because it almost always leads to something funny and can be stretched through the entire length of a book or a movie.The acting was pretty good. There are several scenes in the movie in which Hartman's character is having a row with his wife--and that I could not watch without a heightened sense of realism and an almost grotesque and somewhat sickening dark feeling, in light of what would happen to Phil Hartman in real life not long after the movie was released.Anyway, Sinbad and Hartman made the movie fun. And I certainly enjoyed the fast pace. The Italian gangsters the movie portrays may appear flat, stereotypical, and silly, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in the context of the whole movie. The gangsters are a prop, a background, they were not meant to be these grand characters. They are simply there so that Sinbad could run away from were he was and end up in Hartman's family. It is a comedy, after all, and it calls for comical characters, not grand characters; for exaggeration and misunderstanding, not for hard core realism and clarity.I definitely recommend Houseguest.",4,Houseguest,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,1220,"['Sinbad', 'late', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'up', 'comedy', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'theme', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'almost', 'always', 'something', 'funny', 'can', 'be', 'stretched', 'entire', 'length', 'book', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Hartman', 'character', 'having', 'row', 'wife', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'heightened', 'sense', 'realism', 'almost', 'grotesque', 'somewhat', 'sickening', 'dark', 'feeling', 'light', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'released.Anyway', 'Sinbad', 'Hartman', 'made', 'movie', 'fun', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'fast', 'pace', 'Italian', 'gangsters', 'movie', 'portrays', 'may', 'appear', 'flat', 'stereotypical', 'silly', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'context', 'whole', 'movie', 'gangsters', 'are', 'prop', 'background', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'grand', 'characters', 'are', 'simply', 'there', 'so', 'Sinbad', 'could', 'run', 'away', 'were', 'was', 'end', 'up', 'Hartman', 'family', 'comedy', 'comical', 'characters', 'not', 'grand', 'characters', 'exaggeration', 'misunderstanding', 'not', 'hard', 'core', 'realism', 'clarity.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Houseguest']",Houseguest VHS
