968111,A319SKSB556033,B000E5KQLY,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[3, 4]","By Season Four, the people behind The A-Team just put less and less effort into the story and opted for the same old, same old formulaic nonsense with fake car chases, phony crashes, obvious stunt doubles and poorly integrated stock footage.Only about half of the episodes are worth watching, while the rest are so mundane to the point of being down right awful. The 'Uncle Buckle-Up' episode in particular is just horrendous and the infamous 'Cowboy George' (my eyes, MY EYES!!!) really is as bad as you've heard. I haven't seen it for years (I skipped right over it on this box set) but I remember wishing that the ground would just open up and swallow me, it was that bad. At one point you can even see Dirk Benedict barely containing his embarrassment.The best episodes are not necessarily the ones with the best action and stories. When the show makes the most of out the four characters (usually with an amusing running joke with Murdoch) it can be highly watchable. A young Hulk Hogan even joins in for a couple of episodes.The over-zealous Decker is replaced by equally incompetent General Fullbright in this season but he ends up being killed-off in the last episode (further proof that people DID die in this show), which is actually a complete rip-off ofRambo - First Blood Part II [Blu-ray], to the point of even hiring the same actors for the same kind of roles.Thankfully, things really picked up for Season 5, though I can still only reccomend this to hardcore A-Team completists.The DVD presents the show in absolutely shocking quality. Shot on 35mm film there are a couple of shots that are surprisingly crisp and colorful but I'm afraid that the rest of it is grainy, washed-out and as dull as dish water. The thin Mono soundtracks fail to impress also, and there are no worthy extra features.",3,A serious decline in quality,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,1811,"['Season', 'Four', 'people', 'A-Team', 'just', 'put', 'less', 'less', 'effort', 'story', 'opted', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'formulaic', 'nonsense', 'fake', 'car', 'chases', 'phony', 'crashes', 'obvious', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'poorly', 'integrated', 'stock', 'footage.Only', 'half', 'episodes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'rest', 'are', 'so', 'mundane', 'point', 'being', 'down', 'right', 'awful', 'Buckle-Up', 'episode', 'particular', 'just', 'horrendous', 'infamous', 'George', 'eyes', 'MY', 'EYES', 'really', 'as', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'skipped', 'right', 'box', 'set', 'remember', 'wishing', 'ground', 'would', 'just', 'open', 'up', 'swallow', 'was', 'bad', 'one', 'point', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'barely', 'containing', 'embarrassment.The', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'ones', 'best', 'action', 'stories', 'When', 'show', 'most', 'four', 'characters', 'usually', 'amusing', 'running', 'joke', 'Murdoch', 'can', 'be', 'highly', 'watchable', 'young', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'even', 'couple', 'episodes.The', 'over-zealous', 'Decker', 'replaced', 'equally', 'incompetent', 'General', 'Fullbright', 'season', 'up', 'being', 'killed-off', 'last', 'episode', 'further', 'proof', 'people', 'DID', 'die', 'show', 'actually', 'complete', 'rip-off', 'ofRambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'Part', 'II', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'point', 'even', 'hiring', 'same', 'actors', 'same', 'kind', 'roles.Thankfully', 'things', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'Season', '5', 'can', 'still', 'only', 'reccomend', 'hardcore', 'A-Team', 'completists.The', 'DVD', 'show', 'absolutely', 'shocking', 'quality', 'Shot', '35mm', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'shots', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'crisp', 'colorful', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'rest', 'grainy', 'washed-out', 'as', 'dull', 'dish', 'water', 'thin', 'Mono', 'soundtracks', 'fail', 'impress', 'also', 'are', 'worthy', 'extra', 'features']",N/A

I remember laughing at Dad when he told me he never missed this show.  Now, the laugh's on me :)  I love this series!  Amazing...plus I've had the cool experience of watching these eps for the 1st time on DVD.  Currently, I'm viewing Season 3.  Season 4's in the mail.  I've heard some forum talk that Season 5 wasn't up to speed compared to the previous 4 seasons.  So, I'm not certain I'll gamble on Season 5 yet.  I haven't noticed any difference between S1 thru S3; I've loved every episode of the ones I've seen up to this point.

I did not have any problems with any of the discs or any of the episodes at all. In fact I enjoyed all the episodes. I thought the bonus episode from season five was really good. The theme music and the opening credits of season five is really good, a very good change. I don't understand why they put that episode on season 4 as a bonus episode when people who have already bought seasons 1-4 are going to buy season 5, so why put that episode when they will have it again on season five? However I did enjoy watching it none the less so no complaints from me. I'm 21 years old and grew up watching the re-runs of the show and I have loved the show ever since. I haven't seen much of season 5 so I really don't know what to expect from that season. Some say that the ratings went down in season 5 and that season 5 was the reason it was cancelled, so like I said, I don't know what to expect on that season. I have ordered that season today and it should be here by next week, so I will find out then how season 5 is. I do know from watching this season, that The A-Team seasons 1-4 are great! I enjoy all the characters, especially Face and Murdock. Hannibal is also one of my favorite characters and B.A, to quote what Hannibal says to Amy Allen in the first season ""He grows on you"" I wasn't all that fasinated with B.A at first, but I've gotten to like him a bit now that I've watched the show for so many years now. I even came to like Lynch and Decker over the years. To see them say that ""We caught the A-Team"" and then they get away again, the looks on thier faces are just unforgettable.

I had multiple returns for numerous series and their seasons.  Each one, it took up to a minimum of three returns before my set was workable.

Six million dollar man had the same issues, but I cared enough about the series that I took 3 to 4 times to get a good set.  This is not Amazon's fault.  Amazon has been an incredible service.  This reflects on Universal Studios release only.  Highly disappointed... Fact:  Amanda Culea who played Amy was fired, because she wanted more action.  Well, that was not the intention for an 80's series for women.  They expected them to look pretty on set, smile a lot and have little to do with the show.  So the series let her go half way through Season 2.  Bionic woman is both pretty and had her own series.  I have no problem with women kicking the bad guys butts.

968124,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000E5KQLY,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 4]","This 1985-86 Season of this action drama was okay, but not nearly as great or as phenomenal as it was during its first 2 seasons, which was proven in the Nielsen ratings, since there was obviously a big decline in where the A-TEAM ranked in the ratings, since the ratings weren't nearly as high as they were in the first 2 seasons, which especially made a big difference in the ratings between the 1st Season and the 4th Season, especially since the honeymoon phase of this show was already long gone and when the show was getting more and more stale and was running out of steam on top of that since the A-TEAM went from being a fivesome when this show made its debut in the Winter of 1983 to pretty much becoming a foursome permanently in the Fall of 1984.Therefore, when the A-TEAM hit its Fourth Season, the excitement of the action and uniqueness of this show was getting a lot more dull and wasn't nearly as good as it was when the A-TEAM made it's debut in it's First Season on NBC in January of 1983, especially since the action wasn't as impressive, the car chases, the stunts seemed to have become phonier, and the stunt-doubles and imposters became more and more obvious along with the fact that the 1985-86 Season didn't have a female co-star for the team in this season either, unlike they did in the first 2 seasons.This was also the season when the A-Teams tough-as-nails nemesis Col.Decker(Lance LeGault)abruptly gets replaced by the ornery nemesis Gen. Fullbright(Jack Ging) after Decker's unsuccessful 2-year pursuit of the A-Team, which was an interesting transition, despite the fact that I preferred Decker to Fullbright, even though the disgruntled Fullbright was an even bigger hard-nose than the bitter Decker was, especially after Decker's last appearance in the ""Blood, Sweat, & Cheers"" episode, which is the episode prior to when the equally incompetent Fullbright replaces Decker as the A-Team's new Army nemesis in the ""Mind Games"" episode when Fullbright makes his first appearance and insults Decker before his first confrontation with the A-Team, except Fullbright ends up dying off in the season finale episode of this 1985-1986 Season ""The Sound Of Thunder"" when Fullbright sends the team to go on a mission to Vietnam with him to help Fullbright find his long lost Vietnamese daughter and to help Hannibal, B.A., and Face find the person who could finally help clear them of their charges from being on the run after being falsely imprisoned for the crime they didn't even commit in the first place, except Fullbright and the A-Team ended up biting the dust again at the end of the episode after rescuing Fullbright's daughter in 'Nam.Therefore, Fullbright was the first and only nemesis of the A-Team's that ever ended up dying off, especially after having an unsuccessful pursuit with The A-Team for less than a year, since none of Fullbrights predecessors such as Col. Decker(Lance LeGault), Col. Lynch(Bill Lucking), and Col.Briggs(Charles Napier) never died off, even though Lynch, Decker, and Briggs all ran out of steam since the A-Team was able to break Decker's spirit after an unfortunate 2-year pursuit with the A-Team and was able to break Lynch's spirit after a failed 10-year pursuit of the A-Team and then they broke Briggs spirit after only one episode, except none of those nemesis died off, unlike Fullbright.It was also intriguing how Gen. Fullbright insulted his biggest predecessor(Col.Decker) in the ""Mind Games"" episode during Fullbright's first appearance, since Fullbright had vowed to succeed where Decker had failed, except Fullbright turned out to be just as incompetent and unsuccessful as Decker and Lynch were, since Fullbright was obviously never any closer and was no more successful than Decker or Lynch ever were.The truth is as the 1985-86 Season progressed, it started becoming less and less interesting and the car chases and stunts seemed to have become less and less convincing and more and more phony, although it was kind of interesting seeing Fullbright chasing The A-Team in some of these episodes during the last 6 months of this season just like it was interesting watching Decker chasing The A-Team in the first few months of this season, but had unfortunately departed after 5 episodes when Decker got replaced by Fullbright in November of 1985 since Decker had so-called ran out steam after biting the dust with the A-Team for over 2 years.Therefore, the first half of the A-TEAM's 1985-86 Season was actually better and more interesting than the second half of the Fourth Season, especially since there was no more Decker in the 2nd half of the 4th Season and no more lady co-stars on the team anymore since there was no more Amy or Tawnia on the show anymore, plus it was almost as if the producers were running out of steam and running out of ideas to make this show continue to be interesting along with the fact that this was the last successful season of the A-TEAM throughout it's whole 4-year run on NBC as if the A-TEAM was starting to lose their touch as if all the co-stars were starting to get tired as if this show was reaching a saturation point, since the ratings bombed in the following season when Hannibal, BA, and Face was no longer on the run from the military and was no longer for hire to the public since the A-Team had started working for the bitter retired Gen. Stockwell(Robert Vaughn) in the Fifth Season which assigned Hannibal, B.A., Face, and Murdock on missions instead, which obviously stole the A-TEAM's thunder which finally led to this shows cancellation in the Spring of 1987.Therefore, the last 3 seasons of this action-packed show weren't as strong as the first 2 seasons were, since the ratings weren't nearly as high nor as strong as they were in the First and Second Seasons of this show, which was another reason why this show bit the dust in the 1986-87 Season of the A-TEAM.Another thing I didn't like about this A-TEAM-Season 4 DVD was it didn't provide a brief summary with it's original air-date posted for them, unlike Universal did with the first 3 seasons of The A-Team DVD's nor put a brief summary with it's original air date on the DVD package or DVD case like Warner Bros. did with both the CHiPs DVD's and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD DVD's, which really sucked, because it's harder to know or find out when each episode was shown for the very first time on NBC.For instance, the original air-dates to each of this seasons episodes were9/24/85: JUDGEMENT DAY10/1/85: WHERE IS THE MONSTER WHEN YOU NEED HIM?10/22/85: LEASE WITH AN OPTION TO DIE10/29/85: THE ROAD TO HOPE11/5/85: THE HEART OF ROCK N' ROLL11/12/85: BODY SLAM11/19/85: BLOOD, SWEAT, & CHEERS11/26/85: MIND GAMES12/3/85: THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD12/10/85: THE DOCTOR IS OUT12/17/85: UNCLE BUCKLE-UP1/14/86: WHEEL OF FORTUNE1/21/86: THE A-TEAM IS COMING, THE A-TEAM IS COMING1/28/86: MEMBERS ONLY2/11/86: COWBOY GEORGE2/18/86: WAITING FOR INSANE WAYNE2/25/86: THE DUKE OF WHISPERING PINES3/4/86: BENEATH THE SURFACE3/11/86: MISSION OF PEACE3/25/86: THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY5/6/86: A LITTLE TOWN WITH AN ACCENT5/13/86: THE SOUND OF THUNDERIn addition to that, I also noticed that about half the episodes on this A-TEAM's 4th Season DVD didn't have any previews before the episode either, but I don't know if it may have been perhaps due to budget cuts or if Universal started getting kind of lazy or what, since just about every episode I can recall of had a preview before each episode started when they were shown on their original air dates on NBC throughout the A-TEAM's whole 1983-87 run on NBC.On the other hand, at least there were more complete and uncut episodes that were shown like they were on NBC as opposed to how they were shown edited with all those deleted scenes & added commercials in between when THE A-TEAM was shown in reruns on FX, TV Land, TNN, Spike, and Retro TV.This 1985-1986 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""NBC: Let's All Be There"", since that was the slogan for NBC from the Summer of 1984 thru the Summer of 1986, which also takes me all the way back to the days during my early teenage years of adolescence when I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA), which not your typical city since the whole Imperial Valley is mostly just a small intimate community with very little to do for fun or entertainment, which is why being an Imperial County resident is only okay if you're married or a cop.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Della Reese in the ""Lease With An Option To Die"" episode before her co-starring days on TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL*Noble Willingham in the ""A Little Town With An Accent"" episode before his co-starring days on WALKER TEXAS RANGER *Ismael Carlo in the ""Lease With An Option To Die"" episode during his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES*Dana Elcar in the ""Judgement Day"" episode during his co-starring days on MACGYVER*David Hedison in the ""Mind Games"" episode after his co-starring days on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA *Richard Anderson in ""The Dr. Is Out"" episode after his co-starring days as Oscar Goldman on THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN & THE BIONIC WOMAN*Singers Rick James & Isaac Hayes in ""The Heart Of Rock & Roll"" episode*Hulk Hogan in the ""Bodyslam"" episode *John Aprea in the ""There Goes The Neighborhood"" episode after his co-starring days as Houston's streetwise cop buddy(Lt. Vince Novelli)on the detective drama MATT HOUSTONThe biggest problem I have with this 1985-1986 Season DVD is they keep skipping & freezing which is probably due to the discs being double-sided instead of single-sided since I have the same problem with the 2-sided discs on the DVD box sets of THE A-TEAM-Season 2, MAGNUM, PI-Seasons 1, 2, and 3; KNIGHT RIDER-Seasons 1, 2, and 4: MIAMI VICE-Seasons 1, 2, and 3; etc. By the way, I just got word that THE A-TEAM movie with Gerald McRaney is scheduled to be released in theatres in the Summer of 2010 which shall be interesting for you
