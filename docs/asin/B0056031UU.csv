1443743,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B0056031UU,DVD Verdict,"[34, 43]","Josh Rode, DVD Verdict --Jacques P&eacute;pin has been a staple on public television for years, and was a world-renowned chef for decades before that. You know that saying, ""He wrote the book?"" P&eacute;pin literally did; his book La Technique is used to teach the fundamentals of French cooking. So when he tells you to slice the corn off the cob by using the upper edge of the knife and cutting straight up toward your exposed chest, you can be assured he knows what he's talking about.Despite his occasional unsafe advice, P&eacute;pin gives clear and detailed instructions, and though I was too lazy to go to the store for ingredients, I felt as if I could have made most of the dishes he demonstrated. He is an unassuming, engaging host whose dishes look so good that your mouth will water as you watch, and you will be tempted to try food that you would otherwise never dream of eating. For instance, I don't like seafood, but P&eacute;pin's Sea Bass in Shredded Potato Skin, Oysters Madison, and Poached Salmon in Ravigote Sauce look delicious. He spends an episode on offal, which are the parts of the animals you normally wouldn't think to eat, such as intestines and tails and something called sweetbread--which is neither sweet nor, in fact, bread; it's a really disgusting dish made from the thymus gland. But after he was done with it, I was ready to chow down.Jacques isn't out to entertain so much as teach, so there is nothing flashy about his presentation. Each episode begins with Jacques, by himself or with a guest, pretending to have dinner. If there is a guest, they will exclaim, ""This is delicious! How did you make it?"" To which Jacques invariably replies, ""This is how I made it,"" and an overview of the recipes he's about to demonstrate runs. Then, after the introductory credits roll, he gets to cooking.The television aspect ratio has been stretched out for widescreen viewing, and the picture is clear and sharp. The colors are not tremendously vivid, but there is good balance. The basic stereo sound is quite adequate, carrying P&eacute;pin's pleasantly accented voice with clarity while allowing the ambient cooking noises to come through as well. There are no extras. My biggest beef with the program is the DVD menus, which have options for selecting individual programs or scenes, but do not have a ""play all"" function, which means that once an episode is finished, the disc goes back to the top menu instead of the next episode. This would be an exceptional ""listen as you do other things"" show if you didn't have to choose another episode every twenty minutes.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",5,Pleasant watch even if you don't know a colander from a strainer,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,2628,"['Josh', 'Rode', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Jacques', 'P', 'eacute', 'pin', 'been', 'staple', 'public', 'television', 'years', 'was', 'world-renowned', 'chef', 'decades', 'know', 'saying', 'wrote', 'book', 'P', 'eacute', 'literally', 'did', 'book', 'La', 'Technique', 'used', 'teach', 'fundamentals', 'French', 'cooking', 'So', 'when', 'slice', 'corn', 'cob', 'using', 'upper', 'edge', 'knife', 'cutting', 'straight', 'up', 'exposed', 'chest', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'what', 'talking', 'about.Despite', 'occasional', 'unsafe', 'advice', 'P', 'eacute', 'clear', 'detailed', 'instructions', 'was', 'too', 'lazy', 'go', 'store', 'ingredients', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'most', 'dishes', 'demonstrated', 'unassuming', 'engaging', 'host', 'dishes', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'mouth', 'will', 'water', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'tempted', 'try', 'food', 'would', 'otherwise', 'never', 'dream', 'eating', 'instance', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'seafood', 'P', 'eacute', 'pin', 'Sea', 'Bass', 'Shredded', 'Potato', 'Skin', 'Oysters', 'Madison', 'Poached', 'Salmon', 'Ravigote', 'Sauce', 'look', 'delicious', 'episode', 'offal', 'are', 'parts', 'animals', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'eat', 'such', 'intestines', 'tails', 'something', 'called', 'sweetbread', 'sweet', 'fact', 'bread', 'really', 'disgusting', 'dish', 'made', 'thymus', 'gland', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'ready', 'chow', 'down.Jacques', ""n't"", 'out', 'entertain', 'so', 'much', 'teach', 'nothing', 'flashy', 'presentation', 'episode', 'Jacques', 'guest', 'pretending', 'have', 'dinner', 'guest', 'will', 'exclaim', 'delicious', 'How', 'did', 'make', 'Jacques', 'invariably', 'replies', 'how', 'made', 'overview', 'recipes', 'demonstrate', 'runs', 'Then', 'introductory', 'credits', 'roll', 'cooking.The', 'television', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'been', 'stretched', 'out', 'widescreen', 'viewing', 'picture', 'clear', 'sharp', 'colors', 'are', 'not', 'tremendously', 'vivid', 'good', 'balance', 'basic', 'stereo', 'sound', 'quite', 'adequate', 'carrying', 'P', 'eacute', 'pin', 'pleasantly', 'accented', 'voice', 'clarity', 'allowing', 'ambient', 'cooking', 'noises', 'come', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'extras', 'biggest', 'beef', 'program', 'DVD', 'menus', 'have', 'options', 'selecting', 'individual', 'programs', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'play', 'function', 'once', 'episode', 'finished', 'disc', 'back', 'top', 'menu', 'instead', 'next', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'exceptional', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'choose', 'episode', 'twenty', 'minutes.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Jacques Pepin: The Essential Pepin

I love the show the most when he talks about the difference between the way they used to do things and how he does it now. For example, my mother would cringe at the notion of cracking an egg directly into a food mixture. What if its bad?  Well Mom, I have never ever gotten a bad one. According to Jacques Pepin it used to be fairly common, but not anymore.  He explains classic techniques and newer techniques, such as the different techniques a person should use if doing something by hand vs a food processor.  You know that one about adding one egg at a time and waiting til its mixed in before you add another when baking? I remember seeing Emeril Lagasse shake his head saying ""Who makes up these rules?""  Well if he watched this show he would learn the story behind that.Mostly the show focuses on how to make the wonderful dishes he is making, but it is peppered with these gems of knowledge that I find precious.The only thing he does that I kinda wish he would stop is occasionally having people on with him. Its part of his message that cooking is a labor of love to be enjoyed with friends and family.  That's a beautiful idea. But his friends and family, quite understandably, are just not at ease in front of a camera the way he seems to be.  But its a small thing.  I LOVE THIS SHOW!
