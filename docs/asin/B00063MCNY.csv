All this DVD has is a few music video/comedy bits on it.  16 minutes total!!!  It's not worth $10.  It's not even work half that.  He should have sold the DVD and CD as a combo like other comedians did (like Dane Cook's ""Harmful if Swallowed"" CD & DVD).  Instead it costs $10 to buy this DVD and another $14 to buy the CD.Just buy the CD, which is really worth it, skip the DVD!",2,Buy the CD - NOT this DVD!,1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,516,"['love', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'DVD', 'rip', 'track', 'listing', 'description', 'CD', 'same', 'name', 'NOT', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'few', 'music', 'video/comedy', 'bits', '16', 'minutes', 'total', 'not', 'worth', '10', 'not', 'even', 'work', 'half', 'should', 'have', 'sold', 'DVD', 'CD', 'combo', 'other', 'comedians', 'did', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Harmful', 'Swallowed', 'CD', 'DVD', 'Instead', '10', 'buy', 'DVD', '14', 'buy', 'CD.Just', 'buy', 'CD', 'really', 'worth', 'DVD']",N/A

What I got instead was 15 minutes of the worst video I've ever seen! The music was so loud, it drowned out the lyrics -- supposedly based on Engvall's routines.
