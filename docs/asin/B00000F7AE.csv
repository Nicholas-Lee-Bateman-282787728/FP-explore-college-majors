499436,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00000F7AE,A Customer,"[1, 3]","Summary:The Little family - Frederick (Hugh Laurie), Eleanor (Geena Davis), and George (Jonathan Lipnicki) - want an addition to their family.  When Frederick and Eleanor visit the orphanage they end up talking to a mouse who happens to be just the addition to their family they are looking for.  When they bring Stuart (Michael J. Fox - voice) home, George seems to realize, though no one else does, that Stuart isn't human; he's a mouse.  Stuart and George don't get off on the best foot.The Littles also happen to have a cat, Snowbell (Nathan Lane - voice), who can't handle being the pet of a mouse.  Snowbell enlists the aid of some ally cats to get rid of Stuart, but the plan only takes effect after Stuart works his way into George's life and they become very close.  Eventually Stuart is spirited away and it is only through the combined efforts of the Littles, Snowbell, and Stuart that he is able to return to his family.My Comments:I knew this was a kids movie going into it; for some reason my wife didn't seem to.  Anyway, I figured that since there was already a sequel that the first must have been pretty good.  And, in its own way I think it was, but for kids.  My wife and I weren't very entertained.  We also found the movie to be very predictable.So, I don't think that I can really offer a good opinion on this movie.  I thought it was cute, it had a good message, it was kind of fun, but it just isn't something that appeals to adults and, well, we don't have any kids, so it just didn't work for us.  We were almost rooting for George when he pointed out the obvious - Stuart is a mouse.  It was as if no one else seemed to realize this, let alone care.  Granted, the point is that differences shouldn't be a big deal, but when you're an adult and you aren't considering the entertainment value for children, the movie takes on a very different tone.I need to make two comments about the movie, though.  First, both my wife and I love Jonathan Lipnicki.  We saw him first in Jerry MacGuire and think he's a great child actor.  Now, whether or not he is really a great actor or if we just feel a certain closeness to him because he isn't the best-looking kid but has a great smile and is always cast in roles where he just fits perfectly, I don't know.  He's great in this, just like he is in most of the movies he's been in.  Also, Geena Davis was actually surprisingly good.  It was kind of fun to see her in a role like this - it's definitely not Thelma and Louise.Anyway, it's probably a great movie for kids, but if you aren't a kid, it's probably not one that you'll want to go out of your way to see.  We got if from the library, so we didn't feel like we were out anything, especially since we used the time during the movie to exercise.  Otherwise, it definitely wouldn't have been worth renting it and giving it our sole attention.",3,Cute kids movie.,1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,2864,"['Summary', 'Little', 'family', 'Frederick', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'Eleanor', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'George', 'Jonathan', 'Lipnicki', 'want', 'addition', 'family', 'When', 'Frederick', 'Eleanor', 'visit', 'orphanage', 'end', 'up', 'talking', 'mouse', 'who', 'be', 'just', 'addition', 'family', 'are', 'looking', 'When', 'bring', 'Stuart', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'voice', 'home', 'George', 'realize', 'one', 'else', 'Stuart', ""n't"", 'human', 'mouse', 'Stuart', 'George', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'best', 'foot.The', 'Littles', 'also', 'happen', 'have', 'cat', 'Snowbell', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'voice', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'being', 'pet', 'mouse', 'Snowbell', 'aid', 'ally', 'cats', 'get', 'rid', 'Stuart', 'plan', 'only', 'effect', 'Stuart', 'way', 'George', 'life', 'become', 'very', 'close', 'Eventually', 'Stuart', 'spirited', 'away', 'only', 'combined', 'efforts', 'Littles', 'Snowbell', 'Stuart', 'able', 'return', 'family.My', 'Comments', 'knew', 'was', 'kids', 'movie', 'going', 'reason', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Anyway', 'figured', 'was', 'already', 'sequel', 'first', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'think', 'was', 'kids', 'wife', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'entertained', 'also', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'predictable.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'really', 'offer', 'good', 'opinion', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'had', 'good', 'message', 'was', 'kind', 'fun', 'just', ""n't"", 'something', 'appeals', 'adults', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'were', 'almost', 'rooting', 'George', 'when', 'pointed', 'out', 'obvious', 'Stuart', 'mouse', 'was', 'one', 'else', 'seemed', 'realize', 'let', 'alone', 'care', 'Granted', 'point', 'differences', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'when', ""'re"", 'adult', 'are', ""n't"", 'considering', 'entertainment', 'value', 'children', 'movie', 'very', 'different', 'tone.I', 'need', 'make', 'two', 'comments', 'movie', 'though', 'First', 'wife', 'love', 'Jonathan', 'Lipnicki', 'saw', 'first', 'Jerry', 'MacGuire', 'think', 'great', 'child', 'actor', 'Now', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'actor', 'just', 'feel', 'certain', 'closeness', ""n't"", 'best-looking', 'kid', 'great', 'smile', 'always', 'cast', 'roles', 'where', 'just', 'perfectly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'great', 'just', 'most', 'movies', 'been', 'Also', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'was', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'was', 'kind', 'fun', 'see', 'role', 'definitely', 'not', 'Thelma', 'Louise.Anyway', 'probably', 'great', 'movie', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'kid', 'probably', 'not', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'go', 'way', 'see', 'got', 'library', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'were', 'out', 'anything', 'especially', 'used', 'time', 'movie', 'exercise', 'Otherwise', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'renting', 'giving', 'sole', 'attention']",Stuart Little

We are plunged into the movie. No explanations. No motives are  outlined. Why that seemingly sane couple who already have a cute little boy  decided to adopt a rodent?Previous footage of the son playing alone in  his room while the parents attend to their professional duties could help  but there is no such footage.And when you are shown elaborate Western  town set, boat and many other hand-made objects that speak of hundreds  hours the dad spends with his son sharing the joy of creativity the  question is do they need someone else? And need him so bad that on the  adoption day the boy boorsts into the parental bedroon frantic with  expectation, eager to share his playroom, toys and the father's attention  with a stranger. That does not ring true.Yes, it's a fairy tale, but  there is nothing magical about the discrepansies of the film - and it has  many. The script lacks integrity and all too often offends the common  sense. I was not surprised to see that Shayamalan person of Sixth Sense  fame as a co-writer. That explains a lot.Being so much fascinated with  neurotics Mr.Shayamalan just could not make Stuart a joyful little cutie.  The mouse suffers from some kind of guilty conscience and trying too hard  to please everyone. Every time he fails to do so the mouse succumbs to  depresion. It's supposed to make him look more complex and alive, more  sophisticated than the other mouse of American cinema. Also much less  likable.There are 52 weekends in a year, and we all like to take our  kids to the movies so you'll certainly see that movie too - it's a  mega-budget production of a major studio, it's very unlikely to be a 100%  flop.

It will take about an hour and thirty minutes, approximately the same running time as this film.The result? Your child will have an invaluable touch with a piece of classic American children's literature and a precious memory of time spent with you reading the story.If you plop them in front of the TV and watch this dreck you will have rotted their minds.My wife and I pre-screened this film and immediately THREW IT IN THE TRASH.(Full disclosure: we are very conservative politically and observant Catholics).The good things: Geena Davis delivers her usual good performance in a limited role (she was hilarious in ""Earth Girls are Easy""), and pretty much all the performances were solid.The visuals and animation, the pristine New York City settings, spot-on costumes, and characters (apart from the cats) are also very well done, the art direction is excellent.The bad things (and there are lots so bear with me): the cats use gutter mouth and in contrast to the book this is a gigantic pity party for Stuart throughout. His pathetic loneliness undo all the positives.In contrast to the book, Stewart is found in an orphanage, and he is abandoned by parent figures three times in the course of the movie! Once by his real parents, once by the Littles, and once by some mice posing as his real parents. Horrible!Stuart's new brother George does not like Stuart (in the book he is sort of a cloddish benign older brother), until Stuart is a big winner, THEN he is interested in Stuart. The transition from love to hate in a single scene is jarring (nice message).Horrible, horrible horrible rock music (and I like *punk rock*) during chase and slapstick scenes.The whole Little family's sweetness to Stuart is cloying (but then they abandoned him, go figure).Stuart's ""innocence and cuteness"" boarders on diabetic shock sweetness of ""Hello Kitty.""I completely agree with a review here titled ""Have we no shame"" when they wrote: ""It's a crime and a sin what was done to E.B. White's classic children's novel. Heartless Hollywood got hold of it, ripped its guts out, threw in some snazzy effects, irrelevant slapstick, and rock music, and dared to call it ""Stuart Little."" All in the name of money. I'm not saying some six year-olds won't have fun watching it, but for the love of integrity, someone please read them the book.""So read them the book.E.B. White's original ""Stuart Little"" is the story of a mouse born to a normal human family who lives on the upper east side of New York. Stuart must overcome challenges as a small being in a normal sized world and his interactions with his normal family and their care for him make for lively reading. One day Margalo, an injured bird, enters Stuart's life and they become friends. One day the family cat, Snowbell, and an alley cat come up with a plan to kill Margalo. A pigeon overheard the plan and sent a note to Margalo, and so Margalo leaves. Stuart sets out to search for Margalo and the story ends with him still searching. The story appeals to children because of fine balance of a blend of fantasy and reality. Children relate to the obstacles Stuart encounters because of his size and encourages children to learn to use determination to overcome obstacles in life. It also concludes with the bittersweet ending that we must keep searching and trying, even when we do not find.Do not buy this movie. Buy the book. Read it to them.

All three of them gave very good performances. That's it. The rest of the movie is trash. I never read E.B. White's original children's book, so I have nothing against the actual story. One of the problems I have with this film in particular is that it tries really hard to be as sweet as it can, and it turns out to look and feel MUCH too sentimental. The dialogue is corny, and the humor is dull (even for a family film). Plus, the innocence and cuteness of the main character (of the same name) is forced to the point that he is painfully irritating to look at. Now, Michael J. Fox is a brilliant actor, but his voice for the mouse does get annoying by the second half of the film. And I never liked the roles that Jonathan Lipnicki has ever played (including the one in the film Jerry Maguire), and his character named George Little is a big reminder of why I don't.You may think that I'm too harsh, but honestly I don't completely hate this film. Davis, Laurie, and Lane are indeed good, but they can't save Stuart Little from being a pretty bad film.

From the co-director of The Lion King and the writer of The Sixth Sense comes an entertaining family film from classic American author E.B. White. It's surely a star-studded crew there, and there's not much a family of four could white other than a couple of talking mouse's and many exciting scenes. Even though Stuart Little falls flat from a few flaws, it's still a fun children's comedy, that will be worth your time, depending on your feelings towards movies like this.In a cosy house near New York City's Central Park, Mr. and Mrs. Little (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) bring home a surprising addition to the family...Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox), and he's a er...mouse. Despite the urgings of Mrs. Keeper at the orphanage to adopt within their own species, the Littles beam with the pride of new parents. At home the little guy with a big heart (not to mention whiskers, a little pink nose and a really dapper wardrobe), searches for a sense of belonging and a place to call home in the decidedly supersized world. When Stuart is adopted by the Littles he embarks on an adventure with a variety of characters - including his nemesis, the cat Snowball (voiced by Nathan Lane) - and learns the true meaning of family, loyalty and friendship. The Littles, in the meantime, each discover there is a Stuart in all of us - the spunk, spirit and courage to be true to ourselves and follow our dreams despite the odds.Stuart Little is a good movie, but it suffers majorly from an over-corny note. It's big smiles and drowning frowns all the time, none of the characters ever look normal. Their expressions are practically drawn in, and none of them have much originality about them apart from Stuart, of course. Still, the film provides plenty of entertaining scenes, including an exhilarating cat chase and a superb boat race. It may have a sense of bore in some parts of the film, but overall, it's a very bearable movie that will silent children and, surprisingly, adults for a rainy day. It's a film that combines live action with some groundbreaking visual effects by artists and innovators who have taken digital character creation to a bold new level with the birth of Stuart. The visual effects are the most plausible thing about the film, they are truly memorable, it's some of the most amazingly done animal-talking done since Babe.Not as good as it could've been, Stuart Little is still watchable fun, a film where you can really expect the whole family to enjoy it.",3,Fun entertainment that suffers from an overly-mawkish tone,986601600,"04 7, 2001",2001,2600,"['Stuart', 'LittleScore', '64/100He', 'clever', 'enthusiastic', 'can-do', 'little', 'guy', 'attitude', 'mouse', 'co-director', 'Lion', 'King', 'writer', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'entertaining', 'family', 'film', 'classic', 'American', 'author', 'E.B', 'White', 'surely', 'star-studded', 'crew', 'there', 'not', 'much', 'family', 'four', 'could', 'white', 'other', 'couple', 'talking', 'mouse', 'many', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'Even', 'Stuart', 'Little', 'flat', 'few', 'flaws', 'still', 'fun', 'children', 'comedy', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'depending', 'feelings', 'movies', 'this.In', 'cosy', 'house', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Central', 'Park', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Little', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'bring', 'home', 'surprising', 'addition', 'family', 'Stuart', 'voiced', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'er', 'mouse', 'urgings', 'Mrs.', 'Keeper', 'orphanage', 'adopt', 'own', 'species', 'Littles', 'beam', 'pride', 'new', 'parents', 'home', 'little', 'guy', 'big', 'heart', 'not', 'mention', 'whiskers', 'little', 'pink', 'nose', 'really', 'dapper', 'wardrobe', 'sense', 'belonging', 'place', 'call', 'home', 'decidedly', 'supersized', 'world', 'When', 'Stuart', 'adopted', 'Littles', 'adventure', 'variety', 'characters', 'including', 'nemesis', 'cat', 'Snowball', 'voiced', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'true', 'meaning', 'family', 'loyalty', 'friendship', 'Littles', 'meantime', 'discover', 'Stuart', 'spunk', 'spirit', 'courage', 'be', 'true', 'ourselves', 'follow', 'dreams', 'odds.Stuart', 'Little', 'good', 'movie', 'majorly', 'over-corny', 'note', 'big', 'smiles', 'drowning', 'frowns', 'time', 'none', 'characters', 'ever', 'look', 'normal', 'expressions', 'are', 'practically', 'drawn', 'none', 'have', 'much', 'originality', 'apart', 'Stuart', 'course', 'Still', 'film', 'plenty', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'including', 'exhilarating', 'cat', 'chase', 'superb', 'boat', 'race', 'may', 'have', 'sense', 'bore', 'parts', 'film', 'overall', 'very', 'bearable', 'movie', 'will', 'silent', 'children', 'surprisingly', 'adults', 'rainy', 'day', 'film', 'live', 'action', 'groundbreaking', 'visual', 'effects', 'artists', 'innovators', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'digital', 'character', 'creation', 'bold', 'new', 'level', 'birth', 'Stuart', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'most', 'plausible', 'thing', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'memorable', 'most', 'amazingly', 'done', 'animal-talking', 'done', 'Babe.Not', 'as', 'good', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Stuart', 'Little', 'still', 'watchable', 'fun', 'film', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'expect', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy']",Stuart Little

499486,AGAR2DLEA4FF5,B00000F7AE,"Lisa Ebeling ""laa-laa""","[21, 27]","&quot;Stuart Little&quot; is the kind of movie that our family waits to buy when it hits VHS because we know we'll watch it over and over again.  With two toddlers at home, we almost never go to the theatre:  it's  cost-prohibitive, drinks aren't served in sippy-cups, and no one at the  theatre will punch the &quot;pause&quot; button while you change a  diaper!Knowing that Michael J. Fox provides the voice of the main  character, watch this video with his characterization of Alex P. Keaton  (&quot;Family Ties&quot; television series--remember that one?) in mind.  The animators must've used the new technology in which the &quot;live&quot;  actor is rigged up with a special suit which translates his movements to  the screen when the animation is done.  Watch Stuart's movements; it's  Michael J. Fox all over--except that he's a mouse!Suspend your  disbelief and allow yourself to imagine that a human family would, in fact,  adopt a little mouse into their family.  The human characters in the movie  certainly accept this fact as possible.Best points of the film:  the  boat race scene is wonderful, suspenseful, and had even the fortyish crowd  at our house hollering and cheering--and gasping when Stuart was in danger;  the scenes with the little red roadster were wonderful and entirely  realistic; and the cats are superb!  The movement of their mouths is just  slightly exaggerated, but still quite believable.  As a cat-owner (can one  ever really &quot;own&quot; a cat?), the funniest scene is the one in which  Snowbell sends the pack of alley cats into the drink.  I looked for a blurb  at the end of the credits saying that &quot;no cats were harmed in the  filming of the production,&quot; but I didn't find such a statement.  It  was totally realistic--and hilariously funny!Only a concern or two:  I  don't know what constitutes a &quot;PG&quot; rating, but that is the rating  given to this film.  I did notice--and do NOT LIKE--that the word  &quot;damn&quot; is used at least once, the phrase, &quot;what the  hell&quot; occurs about twice, and I really don't think the film would've  suffered if those phrases had been left out.  Fortunately, we always watch  TV at home with the  closed-captioning on, and the words often pop up at  the bottom of the screen just a couple of moments before the dialogue is  heard; that gives Mom or Dad time to hit the &quot;mute&quot; button on the  remote for just a second, or to distract the small children who are  watching the movie.  There is no overt violence in the film, but Stuart is  threatened quite frequently by the cat(s) in the film, and sometimes my  young children are sensitive to certain phrases which allude to a movie  character being killed or being threatened with death.Normally I'm not  a Geena Davis fan, but she was sweet in this movie, and I enjoyed her  performance.  It seems like I should know who Hugh Laurie is, but I just  can't place him, and that makes him the perfect choice to portray the  nerdy-but-well-meaning dad.  I've been unable to see the credits at the end  of the film; they are too tiny to read from a reasonable distance, and I  couldn't carry the baby to the TV fast enough to get a better look.  Maybe  Columbia Pictures could use a larger type-style in future--and give the  credits the full screen rather than making them compete with the additional  footage at the end of the film.  Many movie buffs like me stay in the  theatre until the credits have rolled to a complete stop; we want to see  who all the actors in a film were, even the minor ones.  (Wasn't that one  of the Tilly sisters who played the &quot;fake&quot; mouse-mother?  Even  her make-up and mannerisms pegged her as a Tilly for me.)After the movie  is over, the VHS version includes a couple minutes of out-takes and  bloopers from the making of &quot;Stuart Little.&quot;  They're fun to  watch, too, and give ordinary people like me a glimpse into the world of  movie-making.  It must be a fabulous job to be an actor.Just be aware of  the handful of expletives that occur in this film before you plunk your  children down in front of the set if you want them to watch &quot;Stuart  Little&quot; unsupervised.  My kids are just the age that they pick up  every new word they hear, and it's not at all cute to have your  &quot;baby&quot; say swear words in public.

499505,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00000F7AE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","There are good things about the movie, there are bad things about the movie. The four-year-old reviewer didn't like it because, and I quote, &quot;the cats were mean.&quot; They were also funny, and the feline antics  in this movie were one of its high points. The kid who played George was  top-nitch, as well, even if the script he had to work with was a little  thin (movies where one cast member's feelings about another go from hate to  love in one scene drive me bats, and it happens here twice). Having never  read E. B. White's book, I've no idea whether any of this at all was  faithful to that, but if so, I need to go back and look at E. B. White with  a far more critical eye; I think he's a better writer than this, though.  Blame the adaptation.And the mouse? The animation was good. Could  have been better, but then I saw this five days after seeing Toy Story 2,  and anyone's animation would pale in comparison to the wonders being  churned out twice yearly by Pixar. So I can't really fault them for not  spending the extra twenty million or so to come up with the world's best  animation.Now for the humans. First off, no one will be giving  makeup Oscars to the person who worked on Geena Davis; had someone hit her  with a ruler during the making of this film, it would have sunk in at least  to the 6. She moves very slowly throughout the movie, no doubt because  she's wearing at least fifty pounds of pancake makeup. The other main human  character is Hugh Laurie; I've never been a Fry and Laurie fan, but I must  admit he's an engaging sort. Almost as good as the kid.And then come  the cameos. There were so many stars in this movie with less than a minute  of screen time I had flashbacks to The Thin Red Line. The always-underrated  Kimmy Robertson shows up for a single line; Dabney Coleman gets about  fifteen seconds. And so on, and so on. Even Chazz Palminteri (as the voice  of the main alley cat) gets more screen time, and he never shows up bodily.  Sheesh. (Palminteri, by the way, is a riot.) Even Estelle Getty, who's a  many-times-proven comic genius, gets one line.

The same family members are there, along with some of the set pieces (the boat, the car), but otherwise--everything's different.  And that may be a good thing. The book felt incongruent, suffering from no real plot and a chopped-off ending. In the book, the reader is left wondering if Stuart finds the bird. In the movie, there is no bird. There's also no little girl, no doctor, no school house, and no telephone line worker.The plot of the movie--again, something the book didn't have--is that Stuart struggles with his identity within the family. This is because in the movie Stuart is adopted. Stuart's human brother wants no part of Stuart; the family cat is laughed at from other cats because he has a mouse owner. Those are the two things that drive the plot: how does Stuart connect with the humans and how does he avoid the ulterior motives of the cat?Overall the movie is decent enough to sit through. There are plenty of A-list cast members supporting this. It's also directed by a now-famous director. The plot is enough to ask ""what's going to happen next?""

It even includes a brilliant set of short  'audition' animations from various animators showing what each could do in  15 seconds given the mouse, a bacground and a couple of props.",4,An excellent family movie,961027200,"06 15, 2000",2000,709,"['movie', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'video/DVD', 'format', 'did', 'cinemas', 'very', 'warm', 'heartening', 'story', 'talking', 'orphan', 'mouse', 'who', 'adopted', 'human', 'family', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'including', 'cat', 'learn', 'live', 'together.They', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'contain', 'particular', 'surprises', 'whole', 'thing', 'so', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'pleasure', 'watch.In', 'addition', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'best', 'around', 'put', 'majority', 'other', 'DVDs', 'shame', 'even', 'brilliant', 'set', 'short', ""'audition"", 'animations', 'various', 'animators', 'showing', 'what', 'could', 'do', '15', 'seconds', 'given', 'mouse', 'bacground', 'couple', 'props']",Stuart Little
