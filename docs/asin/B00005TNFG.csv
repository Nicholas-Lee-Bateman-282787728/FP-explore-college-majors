682070,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005TNFG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 11]","Au Pair Girls is a prime example of the genre of saucy little sexploitation films that emerged out of campy British studios in the 1970s.  Four foreign, nubile, young ladies come to England to better their English while serving in the households of sponsor families.  Don't expect a documentary of the au pair work experience because the only thing these girls do is take off their clothes and engage in some 1970s sexual shenanigans.  One of them is actually rather virginal, but that doesn't last long - not after she meets up with Ricky Strange, the most inexplicably popular pop star I've ever seen.  Ol' Ricky looks like the evil, disgusting twin of John the Baptist.  One girl, played by Me Me Lai (I kid you not) actually seems somewhat serious and industrious, but the unbridled geekiness of her new charge proves to be more than she can resist.  Then you have a Swedish girl who couldn't outsmart a piece of paper.  Oh, it's just horrible and, frankly, pathetic - although I have seen much worse than this.I suppose all the nudity was wild and crazy back in 1972, but now it's just rather boring, and the men are just disgusting.

682072,A2MB7ZIINKGPY1,B00005TNFG,"D. Steinmetz ""dwsteinme""","[22, 25]","This film falls into the category of a victimless 'guilty pleasure'. Sort of like sneaking in a chocolate bar while you're on a diet. The Au Pair Girls is British exploitation, plain and simple, with a nifty 70's twist. It was a hoot just to see the various fashions and hairstyles that were popular at the time. And a bit of a surprise to see full frontal nudity, considering the year it was released (1972). There's not much of a plot, it basically covers 24 hours in the lives of 4 young women who arrive in England to start their new lives as au pairs.Your first tip-off that this film isn't exactly a top shelf production happens about 6 minutes into the movie. As the au pair girls are arriving at the agency, a man directs them to an elevator. To the right, a flight of stairs. As German lovely Christa (Nancie Wait) arrives, you can actually see the shadow of a boom microphone on the wall at the top of the stairs. This gaff is made all the more humorous by the fact that only music is heard at this scene, no dialogue.I got the film basically for one reason: Gabrielle Drake. I had a terrible crush on her as a kid, watching her in the role of Lt. Ellis, one of the purple-haired dolls on the moonbase in the short-lived sci-fi series 'UFO'. She didn't disappoint here, leaving precious little to the imagination. Le Le May, also known as Nan Lee, Le Le Mai and half a dozen other names, is also an eyeful. The Burma-born beauty had the least 'skin time' of the four, but she had more prominent roles in the cheesy Italian schlock films like 'Man From Deep River', and 'Jungle Holocaust'. Nancie Wait looks nice as the German virgin, Christa. The daughter of the couple who she's staying with, Carole, decides to give her a night she'll never forget by introducing the innocent au pair to rock singer Ricky Strange, an obvious, but laughable imitation of Jim Morrison. In the film's only truly emotional and touching scene, after a passionate fling with Ricky, Christa then sees him fall into the arms of his open-minded girlfriend, the aforementioned Carole, for more lovemaking. Christa collapses in tears, realizing that she has just been used and what was supposed to be a 'special night', has been robbed from her forever. The final au pair, played by Astrid Frank, to me, was the least attractive, as a woman and a character in the movie. After watching her, I have a good idea how all the 'dumb blonde' jokes got started. She was just too stupid to be likeable.All in all, if you like nostalgic 'naughty' films from the silly 70's, this one should fit the bill nicely. Mostly an excuse for a T&A; show, but an enjoyable one.",4,To see such fun...,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,2641,"['film', 'category', 'victimless', 'pleasure', 'Sort', 'sneaking', 'chocolate', 'bar', ""'re"", 'diet', 'Au', 'Pair', 'Girls', 'British', 'exploitation', 'plain', 'simple', 'nifty', '70', 'twist', 'was', 'hoot', 'just', 'see', 'various', 'fashions', 'hairstyles', 'were', 'popular', 'time', 'bit', 'surprise', 'see', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'considering', 'year', 'was', 'released', '1972', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'basically', '24', 'hours', 'lives', '4', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'arrive', 'England', 'start', 'new', 'lives', 'au', 'pairs.Your', 'first', 'tip-off', 'film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'top', 'shelf', 'production', '6', 'minutes', 'movie', 'au', 'pair', 'girls', 'are', 'arriving', 'agency', 'man', 'elevator', 'right', 'flight', 'stairs', 'German', 'lovely', 'Christa', 'Nancie', 'Wait', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'shadow', 'boom', 'microphone', 'wall', 'top', 'stairs', 'gaff', 'made', 'more', 'humorous', 'fact', 'only', 'music', 'heard', 'scene', 'dialogue.I', 'got', 'film', 'basically', 'one', 'reason', 'Gabrielle', 'Drake', 'had', 'terrible', 'crush', 'kid', 'watching', 'role', 'Lt.', 'Ellis', 'one', 'purple-haired', 'dolls', 'moonbase', 'short-lived', 'sci-fi', 'series', ""'UFO"", 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'leaving', 'precious', 'little', 'imagination', 'Le', 'Le', 'May', 'also', 'known', 'Nan', 'Lee', 'Le', 'Le', 'Mai', 'dozen', 'other', 'names', 'also', 'eyeful', 'Burma-born', 'beauty', 'had', 'least', ""'skin"", 'time', 'four', 'had', 'more', 'prominent', 'roles', 'cheesy', 'Italian', 'schlock', 'films', ""'Man"", 'Deep', 'River', 'Holocaust', 'Nancie', 'Wait', 'nice', 'German', 'virgin', 'Christa', 'daughter', 'couple', 'who', 'staying', 'Carole', 'give', 'night', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'introducing', 'innocent', 'au', 'pair', 'rock', 'singer', 'Ricky', 'Strange', 'obvious', 'laughable', 'imitation', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'film', 'only', 'truly', 'emotional', 'touching', 'scene', 'passionate', 'fling', 'Ricky', 'Christa', 'then', 'fall', 'arms', 'open-minded', 'girlfriend', 'aforementioned', 'Carole', 'more', 'lovemaking', 'Christa', 'tears', 'realizing', 'just', 'been', 'used', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', ""'special"", 'night', 'been', 'robbed', 'forever', 'final', 'au', 'pair', 'played', 'Astrid', 'Frank', 'was', 'least', 'attractive', 'woman', 'character', 'movie', 'watching', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'how', ""'dumb"", 'blonde', 'jokes', 'got', 'started', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'stupid', 'be', 'likeable.All', 'like', 'nostalgic', ""'naughty"", 'films', 'silly', '70', 'one', 'should', 'fit', 'bill', 'nicely', 'Mostly', 'excuse', 'T', 'A', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'one']",N/A
