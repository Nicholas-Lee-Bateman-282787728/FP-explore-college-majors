Chapdelaine ""film collector""","[4, 4]","this dvd collection is awesome despite what the amazon guy (who reviewed it) says. i thought the characters where devoloped perfectly. there is no need to prolong the obvious. they tell you what he's doing and why he's doing it. isn't that enough? or do you like drawn out exhausting plots like akira? though there is some funny phrases in the story it does not at all have silly undertones. the crazy twists that are given to the vampires (such as implanted vampires and vampires wearing crosses) gives this set a unique feeling the whole way through. the only thing i thought was a little bit strange was the theme song for the opening and closing credits. it doesn't (in my opinion) fit the story. that really doesn't matter anyway since it's only on for about 30 seconds. another thing i loved about this anime is the english dubbs are excellent. i'm not one of those anime nerds that likes to watch subtitles instead of the actual movie and this will not disappoint those of you who feel the same. i give this series a 5 do to extreme violence, gore, adult situations and great animation / dubbing. enjoy!",5,one of the best !,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1110,"['dvd', 'collection', 'awesome', 'what', 'amazon', 'guy', 'who', 'reviewed', 'i', 'thought', 'characters', 'where', 'devoloped', 'perfectly', 'need', 'prolong', 'obvious', 'tell', 'what', 'doing', 'why', 'doing', ""n't"", 'enough', 'do', 'drawn', 'out', 'exhausting', 'plots', 'akira', 'funny', 'phrases', 'story', 'not', 'have', 'silly', 'undertones', 'crazy', 'twists', 'are', 'given', 'vampires', 'such', 'implanted', 'vampires', 'vampires', 'wearing', 'crosses', 'set', 'unique', 'feeling', 'whole', 'way', 'only', 'thing', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'strange', 'was', 'theme', 'song', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', ""n't"", 'opinion', 'fit', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anyway', 'only', '30', 'seconds', 'thing', 'i', 'loved', 'anime', 'english', 'dubbs', 'are', 'excellent', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'anime', 'nerds', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'instead', 'actual', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'who', 'feel', 'same', 'i', 'give', 'series', '5', 'do', 'extreme', 'violence', 'gore', 'adult', 'situations', 'great', 'animation', '/', 'dubbing', 'enjoy']",Hellsing: Complete

996843,A3S34VW0BBC9L6,B000FVQYQ8,"CharlieGone ""CharlieG""","[0, 0]","Out of many Vampire series I bearably watch, Hellsing and Vampire Hunter D are the only ones that make the list. It really isn't much about the art, the story line that is great (by today's standards they are ""weak""), but rather the characters that bring in some complex attitudes and feelings in this world of vampires. Alcuard, is pretty much your anti-hero; cold blooded and really doesn't care if humans die as long as he has his ""fun."" To him it's all about fighting the strongest of the strongest and satisfying his urge for blood. Seras Victoria the other main character on the other hand tries to fight the urges she feels to kill and maim, unlike Alcuard who follows his true feelings. Integra Hellsing, the leader of the Hellsing organization is just one tough cookie. To her killing, hunting vampires, keeping her men alive, and maintaining her family's image is much more important than anything else. As you can see Hellsing is filled with interesting characters that just completely make this a great series to watch despite the somewhat lacking storyline and decade old art. Another thing I found really well suited was the choice of using very English voices (for the dub) that, in my honest opinion, suits it very well. Heck even the crazy regenerating father had his Irish accent as well. I can say for sure this anime is a solid 4. I would not recommend this for small kids (12 and under) because it is very very violent and does have some adult situations (no nudity, but ""other adult situations."") I also would recommend Hellsing ultimate, which sticks closer to the original story and IMHO, is superior to this series, but I definitely do recommend this.",4,A Vampire series I can watch,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,1676,"['many', 'Vampire', 'series', 'bearably', 'watch', 'Hellsing', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'D', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'make', 'list', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'art', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'today', 'standards', 'are', 'weak', 'rather', 'characters', 'bring', 'complex', 'attitudes', 'feelings', 'world', 'vampires', 'Alcuard', 'pretty', 'much', 'anti-hero', 'cold', 'blooded', 'really', ""n't"", 'care', 'humans', 'die', 'as', 'long', 'fun', 'fighting', 'strongest', 'strongest', 'satisfying', 'urge', 'blood', 'Victoria', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'other', 'hand', 'tries', 'fight', 'urges', 'kill', 'maim', 'Alcuard', 'who', 'true', 'feelings', 'Integra', 'Hellsing', 'leader', 'Hellsing', 'organization', 'just', 'one', 'tough', 'cookie', 'killing', 'hunting', 'vampires', 'keeping', 'men', 'alive', 'maintaining', 'family', 'image', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'Hellsing', 'filled', 'interesting', 'characters', 'just', 'completely', 'make', 'great', 'series', 'watch', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'storyline', 'decade', 'old', 'art', 'thing', 'found', 'really', 'well', 'suited', 'was', 'choice', 'using', 'very', 'English', 'voices', 'dub', 'honest', 'opinion', 'suits', 'very', 'well', 'Heck', 'even', 'crazy', 'regenerating', 'father', 'had', 'Irish', 'accent', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'say', 'sure', 'anime', 'solid', '4', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'small', 'kids', '12', 'very', 'very', 'violent', 'have', 'adult', 'situations', 'nudity', 'other', 'adult', 'situations', 'also', 'would', 'recommend', 'Hellsing', 'ultimate', 'closer', 'original', 'story', 'IMHO', 'superior', 'series', 'definitely', 'do', 'recommend']",Hellsing: Complete

Based on so many recommendations I bought the Japanese import, which I actually like more than the one advertised here for the entire series (episodes 1-13) are included in two discs, packaged within a light gatefold box, therefore much more compact.Although I enjoy ""Hellsing"" for what it is and laugh with shameless mirth at the pure delight Alucard gets when battling a true vampire, I was hoping for something more atmospheric. I basically wanted something moodier; more mysterious. Something sinister to give me nightmares at night. This, however, did not do the trick, but neither was it supposed to, I assume, so that's my own personal gripe, I guess. This unfortunately won't give you shivers nor chills down your spine but there are some fine points I must mention about this anime. For one I loved the Gothic backdrops (blood red skies and intensely glowing moons, for instance). Also, I instantly became curious as to why the vampire Alucard was serving the human Sir Integra - head of the Hellsing organization, and found myself intrigued with the growth of Seras Victoria - known as kitty before her transformation, while she was still a feeble, timid police girl, so the character's in general and their development throughout the series is fascinating to say the very least. As for the plot, their best weapon against the legions of evil is the powerful Alucard, equipped with special ""blessed"" bullets capable of disintegrating unholy creatures, as well as ghouls (undead slaves of the vampire - corpses that move under their control). With his and even Victoria's help, the loyal troops of Hellsing fight to protect mortals from secret wars brewing in the wicked night.""In the name of God, impure souls of the living dead shall be banished into eternal damnation.

Hellsing has religous ties and aims to eliminate creatures in the land. Fighting a war against vampires and demons for many decades without the general public's knowledge. Lead by Integra Hellsing, a woman of conviction and determination has amassed an army of soldiers which look a lot like a (S.W.A.T.) team, they use special silver-laced ammunitions and blessed bullets to kill vamperic and zombie-like creatures that feed on innocent people. Hellsing soldiers sometimes get over-whelmed and murdered by creatures, but as a last resort they can rely on their own vampire! Hellsing has a powerful vampire named, Alucard, who is the star of the show! He is sadistic, arrogant, creepy, and fighting on the side of good! Fighting evil with evil! Alucard is the best anti-hero to come in a long time. I love it when he talks trash to his enemies, then blasts them with his giant gun or he cuts them up with his super-strength! He is arrogant and pratically fearless and he has an attractive servant named Victoria who is loyal and a good warrior herself! Alucard carries a mysterious past which little of is revealed and a secret that will shock you. The action is intense with bloody fights that include; severed limbs, decapitations, and a bit of cannibalism. The story is mysterious and is told in an excellent pace filled with good character developement and interactions. The artwork and animation is fantastic everything looks great fluid animation. The anime has dark noir over-tones, but everything could be seen good even with all the darkness and shade they used! The voice-acting is excellent and you'll notice that the english language has real british accents. If you like vampire anime or enjoyed, Vampire Hunter D, you will love Hellsing!

Here's the basic premise of the movie:  take Vampire Hunter D, a movie based on a supremely powerful character that has more power on reserve to tap into than the entire national power grid, build the plot to a climatic conclusion where this powerful character duels another supremely powerful character, ala Vampire Hunter D, and finally, when you think the good guy is over and done with, have him tap into his ""lineage""...-- in the style of Vampire Hunter D.  And to top it all off, you end on the same theme; the main character is related to the one and only original, except as in Vampire Hunter D, the main character IS the original; namely, Dracula himself.  Infact, the movie ends on such a cheezy historical reference.  You see the Incognito character IMPALED on a large pike.

Led by Dr. van Helsing descendent Sir Integra Hellsing (an icy-cool, determined woman) with the aide of her vampire minion Alucard--the coolest and toughest anime hero to come along in many a day, the Hellsing Organization faces an onslaught of man-made &quot;freak&quot; vampires and ghouls plus the dangerous Iscariot Organization of the Vatican and their knife-wielding human regenerator.If you enjoy bloody anime, this series is for you. It's not nearly as gruesome as many out there but does have more blood and violence than any of the stuff shown on Cartoon Network today. If you like vampire anime, then this series is also for you; it's a neat take and breath of fresh air in a genre well-exercised in Japan.The animation itself is done really well in terms of visual quality, with a blend of CG and hand-drawn cel work; however, it is somewhat more static in nature than much contemporary anime, comparable to that done for the Record of Lodoss War series.The audio, though presented only in stereo sound, features a soundtrack you'll want to hunt down like a freak after fresh blood. Surprisingly, the english dubbing is quite good, featuring British-accented voice actors far superior to the average anime dub.Hellsing is an excellent addition to any anime fan's library and a must-watch for vampire lovers everywhere.",5,Best Bloody Vampire Series Available!,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,1720,"['Japanese', 'seem', 'find', 'western', 'version', 'Vampire', 'myth', 'quite', 'appealing', 'expression', 'fascination', 'reaching', 'peak', 'anime', 'series', 'Hellsing.Set', 'modern-day', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Hellsing', 'effots', 'powerful', 'private', 'enterprise', 'headquartered', 'Great', 'Britain', 'dedicated', 'defending', 'quot', 'God', 'Queen', 'Country', 'quot', 'ravages', 'vampires', 'Led', 'Dr.', 'van', 'Helsing', 'descendent', 'Sir', 'Integra', 'Hellsing', 'icy-cool', 'determined', 'woman', 'aide', 'vampire', 'minion', 'Alucard', 'coolest', 'toughest', 'anime', 'hero', 'come', 'along', 'many', 'day', 'Hellsing', 'Organization', 'onslaught', 'man-made', 'quot', 'quot', 'vampires', 'ghouls', 'dangerous', 'Iscariot', 'Organization', 'Vatican', 'knife-wielding', 'human', 'regenerator.If', 'enjoy', 'bloody', 'anime', 'series', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'gruesome', 'many', 'there', 'have', 'more', 'blood', 'violence', 'stuff', 'shown', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'today', 'like', 'vampire', 'anime', 'then', 'series', 'also', 'neat', 'take', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'genre', 'well-exercised', 'Japan.The', 'animation', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'terms', 'visual', 'quality', 'blend', 'CG', 'hand-drawn', 'cel', 'work', 'however', 'somewhat', 'more', 'static', 'nature', 'much', 'contemporary', 'anime', 'comparable', 'done', 'Record', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'series.The', 'audio', 'though', 'presented', 'only', 'stereo', 'sound', 'soundtrack', ""'ll"", 'want', 'hunt', 'down', 'freak', 'fresh', 'blood', 'Surprisingly', 'english', 'dubbing', 'quite', 'good', 'featuring', 'British-accented', 'voice', 'actors', 'far', 'superior', 'average', 'anime', 'dub.Hellsing', 'excellent', 'addition', 'anime', 'fan', 'library', 'must-watch', 'vampire', 'lovers', 'everywhere']",Hellsing: Complete

996858,A39MEASYQ85NJX,B000FVQYQ8,"Jummy Bear ""cecil_paladin_1002""","[3, 4]","Fortunately, the series does little to hide it. While the depth of the characters and a strong central plot is sorely lacking, the show still manages to be intriguing nonetheless. The dark art style created a very nice, grim (how's that for an oxymoron) atmosphere, and considering the nature of the show, (revolving around the killing of ""ghouls"" and vampires) it certainly fit the bill. The music was also well composed and helped add to the mood. The redeeming factor of the show by far and away, however, has to be the main ""protagonist,"" Arucard.The character design for Arucard is really something to marvel at. It's a memorable one. Arucard plays his role as a vampire perfectly, looking only to pick fights with those who can come close to rivaling his power. However, for reasons unexplained even at the end of the series, Arucard is controlled by (ironically enough) a vampire and ghoul hunting organization known as Hellsing. Although the series it titled Hellsing, most of it (or at least what the viewer will care about) revolves around Arucard. The roles of the other characters, however, are seriously void. Seras Victoria, another ""central"" character to the story was sorely underdeveloped. She is transformed into a vampire during the very first episode, and at fist, the series showed her struggling to accept her newfound role. By the end of the series, nothing had really changed about her except her ability level and position within the Hellsing organization.The fight scenes are fleeting and aren't really all that fantastic. I'm not someone who typically enjoys super long fight scenes, but 1-2 minute fight sequences, including some with no resolution, aren't what I'm expecting, especially with a show that could have offered so much more. Perhaps it was time constraints, perhaps it was budget concerns, but Hellsing really didn't deliver everything it could have. The show was often disjointed and felt rushed at times.For those looking for a dark, quick fix of anime, much like a popcorn movie, Hellsing will certainly deliver. If you are looking for top notch anime and go in with high expectations, then Hellsing will probably disappoint you. That being said, it is certainly not a bad watch and offers decent entertainment value. However, if you have not seen at least a couple of episodes of the show,I would suggest holding off on an impulse purchase.

Those of us with a ""Hellsing"" addiction discover all too soon there is no other production, anime nor western animation, that will placate our longing and we are forced to suffer the reality of being unsatisfied over and over again.Technically, ""Hellsing"" is not much more than a slide show that drips and oozes.  The artwork and graphic design is almost minamalist by today's standards.  The storyline ranges from the far-fetched to the ridiculous.With all of the above problems, ""Hellsing"" is still the most compelling and alluring series I have seen to date.I find myself being mesmerized by the graphics, while simple they glow of raw talent.  The idiot storyline is not only tolerable but enjoyable due to the wonderful sophisticated characters and their interactions aided by the marvelous voice acting.  Between the art and the voice acting, these inspired characters jump off the screen.If the reader has gotten as far my post, the basic set-up of the story is more than likely understood:  The ""Hellsing Organization"" searches for and destroys vampires (as did Stoker's Van Helsing) with a twist; the ""Hellsing Organization"" uses vampires to kill vampires...and  with one very special vampire in particular.What is interesting is the triangular relationship of the three main characters: Integra Hellsing (the woman in charge and ruler of the Hellsing empire), the vampire Alucard who is also Hellsing's powerful secret weapon, and Seras Victoria the newly created reluctant vampire and devoted follower of Alucard.The personalities of the characters are very sophisticated, and the storyline borders on gender identification, incest and homosexuality without ever going over the line.The characters are so very interesting (but subtle), they could have written any old plot and I would have watched hungrily.  Sometimes it seemed as almost the writer Hirano was out of a fresh idea for a storyline and threw in Sett towards the end.  The way the series ended, though, corrected the course with smart scenes that kept its viewers guessing and never underestimated its audience intelligence.marf",5,Hellsing  Forever More (please)!,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,2265,"['do', ""n't"", 'own', ""'Boxed"", 'Set', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'several', 'times', 'Starz.Tne', 'biggest', 'problem', 'concerning', 'Hellsing', 'video', 'series', 'too', 'quickly', 'Hellsing', 'addiction', 'too', 'soon', 'other', 'production', 'anime', 'western', 'animation', 'will', 'placate', 'longing', 'are', 'forced', 'suffer', 'reality', 'being', 'unsatisfied', 'again.Technically', 'Hellsing', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'slide', 'show', 'drips', 'oozes', 'artwork', 'graphic', 'design', 'almost', 'minamalist', 'today', 'standards', 'storyline', 'ranges', 'far-fetched', 'ridiculous.With', 'above', 'problems', 'Hellsing', 'still', 'most', 'compelling', 'alluring', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'date.I', 'find', 'being', 'mesmerized', 'graphics', 'simple', 'glow', 'raw', 'talent', 'idiot', 'storyline', 'not', 'only', 'tolerable', 'enjoyable', 'due', 'wonderful', 'sophisticated', 'characters', 'interactions', 'aided', 'marvelous', 'voice', 'acting', 'art', 'voice', 'acting', 'inspired', 'characters', 'jump', 'screen.If', 'reader', 'gotten', 'far', 'post', 'basic', 'set-up', 'story', 'more', 'likely', 'understood', 'Hellsing', 'Organization', 'searches', 'destroys', 'vampires', 'did', 'Stoker', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'twist', 'Hellsing', 'Organization', 'vampires', 'kill', 'vampires', 'one', 'very', 'special', 'vampire', 'particular.What', 'interesting', 'triangular', 'relationship', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Integra', 'Hellsing', 'woman', 'charge', 'ruler', 'Hellsing', 'empire', 'vampire', 'Alucard', 'who', 'also', 'Hellsing', 'powerful', 'secret', 'weapon', 'Seras', 'Victoria', 'newly', 'created', 'reluctant', 'vampire', 'devoted', 'follower', 'Alucard.The', 'personalities', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'storyline', 'borders', 'gender', 'identification', 'incest', 'homosexuality', 'ever', 'going', 'line.The', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'interesting', 'subtle', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'old', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'hungrily', 'seemed', 'almost', 'writer', 'Hirano', 'was', 'fresh', 'idea', 'storyline', 'threw', 'Sett', 'end', 'way', 'series', 'ended', 'corrected', 'course', 'smart', 'scenes', 'kept', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'never', 'underestimated', 'audience', 'intelligence.marf']",Hellsing: Complete
996864,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B000FVQYQ8,Michael Crane,"[9, 9]","Welcome to the Hellsing Organization; an army dedicated to keep the country safe from the undead.  The group fights against vampires and ghouls of all sorts in the dark of night.  Their ultimate weapon is a hunter that is a vampire himself, Alucard; an unstoppable figure that can face just about any sort of evil that the darkness has to offer him.  Vampires and ghouls are not safe with this elite team of hunters and soldiers lurking about.This collection of &quot;Hellsing&quot; is a set of four DVDs that reveal this exciting and bloody journey--a quest against the undead and all of their defects and imperfections.  Join Alucard; a vampire who has dedicated his life to serving his master, Sir Integra, and leads to fight against the sleepless dead.  You'll also follow the journey of Hellsing newcomer, Seras Victoria, who was once a police officer until turned vampire.  The Organization is determined to defend humanity against all creatures of the night and vow to face any deadly foe in their way.  These four volumes tell the story of ultimate darkness and evil--and how a certain group is possibly the only weapon against it.I found &quot;Hellsing&quot; to be a complete joy to watch.  While being very stylish and flashy, the series still has structure and depth to it.  The characters are extremely fascinating in their own unique ways.  Alucard has become one of my new favorite anime characters, as he's one not to mess around with!  The series is short, with only having a total of 13 episodes.  While this is a bit of a downside, it also works in a positive way as it won't take much of your time to get through it all.  The first three discs run at about 75 minutes each and the fourth one runs at about 95 minutes total.As I indicated in the reviews for the individual volumes, this is nothing young children should watch.  This eerie and sinister anime series is extremely adult and offers what can be considered sometimes frightening and horrific moments.  The series contains graphic violence, more than a fair amount of blood and gore, strong language, adult content, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  The series gives you a feel of the &quot;Spawn&quot; series in some ways, but still offers a fresh and ideal concept.&quot;Hellsing&quot; is recommended for any fan of anime, as well as any fan of ghouls and vampires.  The series is exciting and thrilling as well as completely mesmerizing.  These 13 episodes give you a wildly trip into the darkness.  Are you ready to do battle against the undead?  Do you think you can follow Alucard, or will you be left behind?

The idea is that Hellsing is a English organization, with permission of the Crown, to search and kill vampires.  You would think this was hard enough but as the story unfolds we find that fake undead are being made.  There is a chip, which, when inserted into the neck makes a human a vampire.  This allows the problem of vampires, the fake ones known as freaks, to spread like wild fire.  Neither the government nor the Pope in Rome is pleased with this (there seems to be a lot of infighting) and none of them are happy with the fact that Hellsing uses vampires within its own military units.There is lots of fighting, gore, bad language, almost-sexual scenes and lots of links to other myths and even suggestions that some of the great vampires are still alive and well.  Arucard, the rogue vampire working for Hellsing, is himself a powerful creature.  Hints about who he is pepper the show, but the big give away is in the last episode.Lots of good artwork, a great soundtrack (I might end up getting the music CDs) and the selection of the English voice actors is perfect.

996866,A29HVOSR9VLFKP,B000FVQYQ8,Mike  Silverman,"[0, 0]","Hellising is an exciting feast for the eyes and a stunning display of animated action. It is also gratuitously bloody and rather pointless as a story. It has perhaps the most ridiculous plot I've yet seen in any anime. It simply doesn't make sense. Hellsing, apparently a secret organization formed to fight evil creatures, particularly vampires, employs one in its service. There is never any clear understanding of why a vicious brutal sadistic and very powerful vampire like Alucard ( yes... it's Dracula spelled backwards...) binds himself into the service of the Hellsing organization , or more precisely to it's attractive ( human ) female leader Integra. Somehow he was ""Defeated"" by Integra's ancestor Abraham Van Helsing and then ""swore"" service to him and his ancestors. Yet Alucard hardly seems defeated at all.  Anyway, the series consists of Alucard fighting off various attempts to awaken undead monstrosities or to attack the Hellsing organization directly, engaging in battle at Integra's orders.  She gives him a mission and some sort of code word as to how much force or violence he is permitted to use to complete the task. Again, VERY strange, and rather pointless. The only reason I can see why she would want Alucard to limit his attacks is to build up excitement in the series at wonderment over just how powerful he really is. And she does just that. As the series progresses Integra allows Alucard more and more leeway in the use of his powers until a final climatic battle with another very powerful vampire, when she basically orders him give it everything he's got. Ever since Bram Stoker wrote Dracula there has been an attempt to romanticize vampires as reluctant heroes tormented by the limitations of their vile existence. Looking at Alucard's power and ferocity as he fights, one can only wonder what horror would ensue if he ever decided to use his power for evil. This series is well worth watching for the beauty and detail of the animated fight sequences. They are breathtakingly fast and dramatic. The angles at which the perspective carries the viewer can only be done in animation.

This is the one and only anime where I genuinely prefer the dub over the original, because the main characters are absolutely spot-on. Crispin Freeman is always good, and the English VAs for Walter, Seras, and Integra are so delightfully dry and British -- which feels appropriate, considering that the characters are British, and that the story (at least in this particular Hellsing) takes place mostly in Britain.All that being said, this older Hellsing is pretty lackluster as a series, especially when compared to the OVAs. It's fun enough for a bloody vampire show, but that's about it. The plot doesn't follow the manga and ends up being holey and silly, the characters are underdeveloped, the animation is dated, and the music is hit-or-miss. The newer OVAs are markedly superior.

The plot is basic in the extreme (seek and destroy) so if that is what you're looking for, look elsewhere.Also, this is not a series for children as violence, language, sexuality, and sadism are all to be found in abundance.This is a series which basically has two major appeals:1. While the plot is simplistic, the triad of main characters display a wide range of subtle behavioral undertones. The odd moments of caring displayed by Alucard, the background of Integra, and the progression of Seras are all intriguing to watch.2. The real reason to watch Hellsing is simple. Alucard is 9 kinds of kickass, and his battle scenes are a blast to watch. I seldom enjoy ""overpowered"" characters, but the way Alucard always holds back and toys with his opponents makes the moments when he truly unleashes his powers  really fun.On the whole, great show, very compelling to watch. I started, and was unable to stop until I watched the whole show in one sitting.Finally, if you find that you like this show, I'd highly recommend checking out the OVAs, as they feature some really great, higher production value versions of content in the series.

What I found was an anime with very good graphics, really great action, mesmerizing characters and a highly addictive storyline. The fact that the anime does not follow the manga closely was not a big issue for me. There are some differences here and there and considerable deviations in terms of the order of presenting events, but I thought that the final product in the anime was very good.One of the main things I liked about this anime is its ""cool"" main character. Alucard -I still can't believe the translators in the subtitles went with Arucard! Is it that hard to spot the anagram of Dracula? - is a powerful vampire that works for the Hellsing organization, helping solve issues with the undead. He carries a slick weapon and dresses in a very peculiar way. He has a great sense of humor and enjoys facing challenging opponents. On top of that, several of the characters he interacts with, such as Seras Victoria, the police officer turned into a vampire by Alucard, or Integra Hellsing, the measured but ruthless head of the Hellsing organization, provide added interest to the series.Next, I am going to follow this up with the new set of OVAs released under Hellsing Ultimate, which are supposed to follow the manga more closely and have improved animation.

996874,A1O9CA15IA31NT,B000FVQYQ8,Short,"[8, 8]","Hellsing is perhaps the best anime I've seen since Cowboy Bebop. It has action, mysterious characters, and a soundtrack that can compete with Cowboy Bebop. The main theme is simple enough. The Hellsing Family of Great Britian has guarded the Royal Family for hundreds of years from vampires and ghouls and other supernatural creatures. The family is currently head by Sir Integra Hellsing (a woman, I swear) who has the ultimate trump card: a vampire of her own. She ressurected the vampire Alucard, who serves her and hunts vampires for Hellsing. At the start of the series, Alucard rescues a young police girl named Seras, and makes her a vampire in his service. Through the course of the series they discover more and more about a plot by another organization that is creating ""artificial"" vampires. The series ends with Alucard fighting the strongest of them, Incognito (yes, the name is funny.)What really makes the series is Alucard, who it is suggested is Dracula. He takes great pride in what he is, and finds the freak vampires to be disgusting abominations. Through the show, the viewer gets the impression that Alucard is bored. He spends his time trying to find a worth opponent that he can go all out against. He finds this in the form of Father Anderson, a Paladin working for a secret Vatican organization, and Incognito. But still, one feels sorry for the vampire because he is so alone. He had wiped out most of his race and can find no enjoyment in missions anymore.Seras is a less likeable character at the start though. She has what I call ""Anne Rice Vampire Syndrome"" where she feels so conflicted about drinking blood and leaving her home. She does get over it, but very late in the series. The other characters are much more impressive like Integra, Anderson, and Walter, Integra's retainer. He seems like a nice old guy, but he's as ruthless as Alucard.I really enjoyed Hellsing, but apparently Japan did not, since it was never that popular. It felt to me like the series was expected to continue, since there are so many plot holes left at the end. The ending notes seemed really tacked on, and there is so much that suggests a second season was intended. I really wish that it was, since the show could have only gotten better. The manga answers many questions, but in a way that seems cheap. But this is good DVD reguardless. The dubbing is well done, and the subtitles are accurate. The price is worth it, and if you get really into it, check out the manga.",5,A Series That Needs a Second Chance,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,2486,"['Hellsing', 'perhaps', 'best', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'action', 'mysterious', 'characters', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'compete', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'main', 'theme', 'simple', 'enough', 'Hellsing', 'Family', 'Great', 'Britian', 'guarded', 'Royal', 'Family', 'hundreds', 'years', 'vampires', 'ghouls', 'other', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'family', 'currently', 'head', 'Sir', 'Integra', 'Hellsing', 'woman', 'swear', 'who', 'ultimate', 'trump', 'card', 'vampire', 'own', 'ressurected', 'vampire', 'Alucard', 'who', 'hunts', 'vampires', 'Hellsing', 'start', 'series', 'Alucard', 'young', 'police', 'girl', 'named', 'Seras', 'vampire', 'service', 'course', 'series', 'discover', 'more', 'more', 'plot', 'organization', 'creating', 'artificial', 'vampires', 'series', 'Alucard', 'fighting', 'strongest', 'Incognito', 'yes', 'name', 'funny', 'What', 'really', 'series', 'Alucard', 'who', 'suggested', 'Dracula', 'great', 'pride', 'what', 'freak', 'vampires', 'be', 'disgusting', 'abominations', 'show', 'viewer', 'impression', 'Alucard', 'bored', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'worth', 'opponent', 'can', 'go', 'out', 'form', 'Father', 'Anderson', 'Paladin', 'working', 'secret', 'Vatican', 'organization', 'Incognito', 'still', 'one', 'feels', 'sorry', 'vampire', 'so', 'alone', 'had', 'wiped', 'out', 'most', 'race', 'can', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'missions', 'anymore.Seras', 'less', 'likeable', 'character', 'start', 'what', 'call', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'Vampire', 'Syndrome', 'where', 'so', 'conflicted', 'drinking', 'blood', 'leaving', 'home', 'get', 'very', 'late', 'series', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'Integra', 'Anderson', 'Walter', 'Integra', 'retainer', 'nice', 'old', 'guy', 'as', 'ruthless', 'Alucard.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Hellsing', 'apparently', 'Japan', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'never', 'popular', 'felt', 'series', 'was', 'expected', 'continue', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'left', 'end', 'ending', 'notes', 'seemed', 'really', 'tacked', 'so', 'much', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'intended', 'really', 'wish', 'was', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'gotten', 'better', 'manga', 'answers', 'many', 'questions', 'way', 'cheap', 'good', 'DVD', 'reguardless', 'dubbing', 'well', 'done', 'subtitles', 'are', 'accurate', 'price', 'get', 'really', 'check', 'out', 'manga']",Hellsing: Complete

996877,A3QJT3VQ5ZA8FB,B000FVQYQ8,"WayneXtreme ""Reading Fiend""","[24, 25]","This is a great show, lots of fight, tons of blood, and even a little bit of gore thrown in makes this one awesome anime.  I love vampires, I love anime, and I love this vampire anime.  About the show: The Hellsing Organization travels throughout England fighting and killing vampires and the Ghouls that the create in order to make the world safer for all.  Below is a quick summary of each of the shows:Disc 1:Order 01: The Undead - Reports of missing people have flooded the small town of Cheddar.  With local police knowing the problem in the town, they have ignored all of the warnings set down by the Hellsing Organization; the police that they have sent are all dead.  Now Alucard has to go in and clean up the mess, soon the fate of one very alive police woman now resides in the hands of Alucard.Order 02: Club M - Seras Victoria is still undergoing her training, not only as a rookie-cop, but also a rookie-vampire.  However, she has to learn fast as the organization is faced with a new problem.  Two psychotic vampires are wreaking havoc on the country, going from house to house, murdering entire families, drinking their blood, and mutilating the remains.Order 03: Sword Dancer - With reports of the creation of a new artificial vampire, the report is confirmed when one college student ends up becoming a vampire.  After an autopsy, it is discovered that he has a chip implanted in him to turn him into a vampire, but even after the chip is removed, he still searches for his lost love.  However, it appears that the Vatican has sent their own agent to dispatch the vampire.Disc 2:Order 04: Innocent as a Human - After a series of vampire-related snuff films are released on the internet; the organization becomes interested when one of the videos shows one of their own members being killed.  Victoria is dispatched to investigate the culprits behind the video after suspecting one of their own.Order 05: Brotherhood - Following the murder of a government agent by two vampire brothers the Hellsing Organization begins to investigate the scene.  However, the two strike first and attack the headquarters of the organization.  With their own army, things begin to look pretty grim for the organization.Order 06: Dead Zone - The Valentine brothers continue their relentless assault on the Hellsing Organization: Walter, Seras, and Alucard appear to be the only ones who can drive them off.  Walter and Seras charge off to fight Jan and his army of ghouls while Alucard hangs back and waits for his brother Luke.Disc 3Order 07: Duel - Reeling from the massive losses suffered from the Valetine brothers' attack, Integra seeks out vengeance for the fallen members of her organization.  After sending out Seras with a team to track down those who are responsible, Integra gets an unwelcome visitor from the Vatican.  Following the heated meeting of the two organization, Alucard heads out to seek a fight with Paladin Alexander Anderson.Order 08: Kill House - Following a raid in China that resulted in the destruction of vital evidence to the origin of the ""Freak Chips"", Integra steps up the search for the people responsible.  Seras teams up with an MI-5 agent to gather information.Order 09: Red Rose Vertigo - During a raid on an old castle, the Hellsing Organization is turned away by the S.A.S..  After the team evacuates the castle, Seras senses something strange in the castle.  Integra gets an unexpected visit from her sister Laura, but upon her arrival strange things begin to happen and Seras suspects that something is up.Disc 4:Order 10: Master of Monster - In order to prevent the change to ghoul, Integra slits her own throat and as her surgeons try to save her, she begins to dream of how she met Alucard and became the leader of the Hellsing OrganizationOrder 11: Transcend Force - Integra is still healing from surgery but things turn worse as there have been several attempts on the queen's life in recent days. Upon receving word that the queen is coming to the Hellsing Castle, Integra begins to make preparations as she sends troops to the Tower of London to set a trap, but who's really setting the trap?Order 12: Total Destruction - Things at the Tower of London has again turned grim for the organization as the troops are easily being wiped out, worse is that the organization itself has been labeled as a terrorist organization.  As the British military tries to stop the Hellsing soldiers, Alucard goes to the Tower in hopes of fighting Incognito.Order 13: Hellfire - The battle between Incognito and Alucard rages on as Walter and Integra head to the Tower.  But as things begin to get worse and worse, Integra realizes that possibly the fate of the entire world rests in Alucard's hands.Overall, this is a great show, the bad thing is that with only 13 episodes, they never really get to the creator of the ""Freak Chips"" and the ending is actually kind of open.  The good news is that there is a new OVA slowly being released on DVD that'll hopefully continue the storyline more.  The music in this show is awesome in my opinion, the show is pretty cool, some weird animation here and there, and lots of blood.  However, there is quite a bit of profanity in this show and there is even some sexual situations so it is definitely not for children.",5,"Watch Your Necks, Vampires Ahead...",1174262400,"03 19,
