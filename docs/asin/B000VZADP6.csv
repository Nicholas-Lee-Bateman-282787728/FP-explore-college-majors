WEREWOLF suffers from a complete lack of identity that causes the entire film to suffer. On the one hand, it attempts to be a straightforward creature feature with a unique costume design and a decent amount of gore and bloody FX. On the other hand, the amateurish filming techniques and ridiculous attempts at humor distract from the horror and give the film an unintentionally goofy tone. As the limbs begin flying, heads start rolling, and jugulars continue to spew, any fans with a decent amount of patience and a love for low-budget animal flicks should be able to stick this one out until the end for its cheesy B-Movie charm and cheap gags, but there is no mistaking that this is terrible Horror at its finest.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",2,Werewolf: Thre Devil's Hound,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,940,"['vicious', 'alluring', 'she-wolf', 'breaks', 'free', 'crate', 'being', 'transported', 'new', 'home', ""n't"", 'long', 'teeth', 'locals', 'seeking', 'out', 'new', 'mate', 'WEREWOLF', 'suffers', 'complete', 'lack', 'identity', 'entire', 'film', 'suffer', 'one', 'hand', 'be', 'straightforward', 'creature', 'feature', 'unique', 'costume', 'design', 'decent', 'amount', 'gore', 'bloody', 'FX', 'other', 'hand', 'amateurish', 'filming', 'techniques', 'ridiculous', 'attempts', 'humor', 'distract', 'horror', 'give', 'film', 'unintentionally', 'goofy', 'tone', 'limbs', 'begin', 'flying', 'heads', 'start', 'rolling', 'jugulars', 'continue', 'spew', 'fans', 'decent', 'amount', 'patience', 'love', 'low-budget', 'animal', 'flicks', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'stick', 'one', 'end', 'cheesy', 'B-Movie', 'charm', 'cheap', 'gags', 'mistaking', 'terrible', 'Horror', 'finest.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A
1105681,A3TKDDLMCYJKT1,B000VZADP6,"C. Chung ""Christopher Chung""","[2, 2]","Imagine, if you will, several 14 year old boys with a video camera who want to make a horror movie inspired from the ""Power Rangers"" show.  But none of them know anything about photography, blocking, and none of them have any money, or even a driver's license, so they're stuck filming in the storage warehouse parking lot across the street.Getting all of this?Now imagine the level of quality that film would be.  That's what this film is.  Except, the real title should be ""Werewolf: Extreme Close-Up.""The first thing that was terribly wrong, was, literally---with no exaggeration, almost every other scene was an extreme close-up.  It was ridiculous!  I have never seen so many close-ups in my life!  I was actually getting a headache and eye strain because every time my brain would adjust to a scene, the camera would relentlessly zoom in or out.  It was impossible to immerse myself in the story, because the zooms, odd angles, and outright bad filming kept taking me out of it.  It was abundantly clear no one had confidence in the camera, so there was no greater cinematography planned except for ""Zoom in!""  And never, ever have I seen so many unflattering close-ups of people's mouths.The next thing was the totally preposterous story.  I'm not going to rehash the plot, as you can read it on the this site's description, but it starts out with an okay---but outlandish premise.  However, instead of progressing, it deteriorates midway through.  What starts out as a werewolf film ends up a comedy with aliens.  It's like during the first half one director tried to keep it grounded in horror, but then the second director decided in the last half he wanted a campy Scooby-Doo dance party with gay Germans and UFOs instead.  I kid you not.  I couldn't make up this crap if I tried.  And there are other baffling plot holes:  Why does the Fire Marshal carry a gun?  He's not a cop.  Why does the she-wolf need a band saw to kill a victim?  Why does the he-wolf need a 2x4 board to fight?  Is there something wrong with their teeth or claws?If that wasn't bad enough, the film hangs very obvious lanterns on all the plot devices that are ""relevant"" or act as foreshadowing.  It was so forced and so unnecessary, it was painful!  Case in point: we see a montage of the main character as he sits around work bored.  Any idiot can see he's bored through the scene, but he actually writes ""I am bored"" on a wipe board to remind the audience how he feels!Did the werewolf at least look cool, you may ask?  Nope.  It was a big, baggy fur suit with a rubber mask and chest, and long white hair.  The face and head actually looked sort'a lion-like.  Sort'a.  But it was lame.The only cool aspect of this film, was the artwork on the back of the DVD case.  That's it.  The rest was unabashed, unmitigated, and unimaginative garbage.  There are plenty of werewolf films that suck but are still watchable just to laugh at, but this falls into the same category as ""Howling: New Moon Rising"": Avoid at all costs!I'm going to have to read some 19th Century British Literature just to grow back the brain cells I lost watching this junk...",1,Werewolf: Extreme Close-Ups,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,3133,"['Imagine', 'will', 'several', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'video', 'camera', 'who', 'want', 'make', 'horror', 'movie', 'inspired', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'show', 'none', 'know', 'anything', 'photography', 'blocking', 'none', 'have', 'money', 'even', 'driver', 'license', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'filming', 'storage', 'warehouse', 'parking', 'lot', 'street.Getting', 'Now', 'imagine', 'level', 'quality', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'film', 'real', 'title', 'should', 'be', 'Werewolf', 'Extreme', 'Close-Up', 'first', 'thing', 'was', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'was', 'literally', '-with', 'exaggeration', 'almost', 'other', 'scene', 'was', 'extreme', 'close-up', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'close-ups', 'life', 'was', 'actually', 'getting', 'headache', 'eye', 'strain', 'time', 'brain', 'would', 'adjust', 'scene', 'camera', 'would', 'relentlessly', 'zoom', 'was', 'impossible', 'immerse', 'story', 'zooms', 'odd', 'angles', 'outright', 'bad', 'filming', 'kept', 'taking', 'was', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'one', 'had', 'confidence', 'camera', 'was', 'greater', 'cinematography', 'planned', 'Zoom', 'never', 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'unflattering', 'close-ups', 'people', 'mouths.The', 'next', 'thing', 'was', 'totally', 'preposterous', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rehash', 'plot', 'can', 'read', 'site', 'description', 'out', 'okay', '-but', 'outlandish', 'premise', 'However', 'instead', 'progressing', 'midway', 'What', 'out', 'werewolf', 'film', 'up', 'comedy', 'aliens', 'first', 'half', 'one', 'director', 'tried', 'keep', 'grounded', 'horror', 'then', 'second', 'director', 'decided', 'last', 'half', 'wanted', 'campy', 'Scooby-Doo', 'dance', 'party', 'gay', 'Germans', 'UFOs', 'instead', 'kid', 'not', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'crap', 'tried', 'are', 'other', 'baffling', 'plot', 'holes', 'Why', 'Fire', 'Marshal', 'carry', 'gun', 'not', 'cop', 'Why', 'she-wolf', 'need', 'band', 'saw', 'kill', 'victim', 'Why', 'he-wolf', 'need', '2x4', 'board', 'fight', 'there', 'something', 'wrong', 'teeth', 'claws', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'film', 'hangs', 'very', 'obvious', 'lanterns', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'relevant', 'act', 'foreshadowing', 'was', 'so', 'forced', 'so', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'painful', 'Case', 'point', 'see', 'montage', 'main', 'character', 'work', 'bored', 'idiot', 'can', 'see', 'bored', 'scene', 'actually', 'am', 'bored', 'wipe', 'board', 'remind', 'audience', 'how', 'Did', 'werewolf', 'least', 'look', 'cool', 'may', 'ask', 'Nope', 'was', 'big', 'baggy', 'fur', 'suit', 'rubber', 'mask', 'chest', 'long', 'white', 'hair', 'face', 'head', 'actually', 'looked', 'sort', 'lion-like', 'Sort', 'was', 'lame.The', 'only', 'cool', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'artwork', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'rest', 'was', 'unabashed', 'unmitigated', 'unimaginative', 'garbage', 'are', 'plenty', 'werewolf', 'films', 'suck', 'are', 'still', 'watchable', 'just', 'laugh', 'same', 'category', 'Howling', 'New', 'Moon', 'Rising', 'Avoid', 'costs', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'read', '19th', 'Century', 'British', 'Literature', 'just', 'grow', 'back', 'brain', 'cells', 'lost', 'watching', 'junk']",N/A
1105682,A20X4D99M0PBIK,B000VZADP6,"C. Taylor ""Wyld Weasil""","[11, 12]","I've been a big fan of the Werewolf Genre of Horror movies and like many fans have been very disappointed with what's come out recently. This movie is no exception.For starters, this could've been a slightly better movie, they had all the elements. Just from viewing you can tell this was done by a special FX team, however, the acting is gawdawful at times, but then again, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt as we're still thinking these people are a special FX team and not actors, so, that being said, this should have a great transformation scene right? Not so much... I don't want to spoil it for you, but I don't think Rick Baker has to worry about losing his job anytime in the next, oh, thousand years. In fact, maybe saying there is a transformation scene is a tease to begin with, with tease being the key word.The story centers around a young guy named Kevin who gets attacked by this mysterious creature that gets accidentally shipped to this Family run Special FX company. The movie gets a little more interesting as the creature takes human form and tempts Kevin into switching sides. It all ends up in a fever pitch with at least 2 ridiculous characters that make you question why you saw the movie at all.The rest of the cast really ruins the story, that's where most of the bad acting comes from. You almost think it was intentionally that bad just for laughs. However, the story itself actually isn't that bad, the story tellers however, you get the point.Hopefully this Werewolf Genre will get back on track in 2009 when the remake of 'The Wolf Man' comes out.",2,Nothing Special here,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1586,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Werewolf', 'Genre', 'Horror', 'movies', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'disappointed', 'what', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'movie', 'exception.For', 'starters', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'slightly', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'elements', 'Just', 'viewing', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'done', 'special', 'FX', 'team', 'however', 'acting', 'gawdawful', 'times', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'giving', 'benefit', 'doubt', ""'re"", 'still', 'thinking', 'people', 'are', 'special', 'FX', 'team', 'not', 'actors', 'so', 'being', 'said', 'should', 'have', 'great', 'transformation', 'scene', 'right', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'worry', 'losing', 'job', 'anytime', 'next', 'oh', 'thousand', 'years', 'fact', 'maybe', 'saying', 'transformation', 'scene', 'tease', 'begin', 'tease', 'being', 'key', 'word.The', 'story', 'centers', 'young', 'guy', 'named', 'Kevin', 'who', 'attacked', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'accidentally', 'shipped', 'Family', 'run', 'Special', 'FX', 'company', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'creature', 'human', 'form', 'tempts', 'Kevin', 'switching', 'sides', 'up', 'fever', 'pitch', 'least', '2', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'make', 'question', 'why', 'saw', 'movie', 'all.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'really', 'story', 'where', 'most', 'bad', 'acting', 'almost', 'think', 'was', 'intentionally', 'bad', 'just', 'laughs', 'However', 'story', 'actually', ""n't"", 'bad', 'story', 'tellers', 'however', 'get', 'point.Hopefully', 'Werewolf', 'Genre', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'track', '2009', 'when', 'remake', ""'The"", 'Wolf', 'Man', 'out']",N/A
