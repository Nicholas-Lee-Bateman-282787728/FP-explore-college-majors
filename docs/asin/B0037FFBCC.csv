My husband and I have been on his program for almost 2 months now and have both lost weight. My husbands blood sugars have stabalized in the low numbers, hopefully with deleting some of his meds in the near future and we are anxious to see how much our cholesterol has changed.  The program is certainly different for those of us who have loved meat and ate way more fat than needed.  Biggest challenge it to try new foods and establish a variety of meals. So far we have found ourselves quite satisfied and not feeling hungry. It is certainly a very healthy way of eating and planning to continue this program.  I would highly recommend it for anyone seeking a healthier diet especially if you are diabetic and needing better control of your eating. For those overweight with the possiblility of becoming diabetic it is essential.",5,Makes sense finally,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,945,"['seeing', 'Dr', 'Barnard', 'PBS', 'ordered', 'book', 'DVD', 'subject', 'certainly', 'have', 'merit', 'husband', 'have', 'been', 'program', 'almost', '2', 'months', 'now', 'have', 'lost', 'weight', 'husbands', 'blood', 'sugars', 'have', 'stabalized', 'low', 'numbers', 'hopefully', 'deleting', 'meds', 'near', 'future', 'are', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'cholesterol', 'changed', 'program', 'certainly', 'different', 'who', 'have', 'loved', 'meat', 'ate', 'way', 'more', 'fat', 'needed', 'Biggest', 'challenge', 'try', 'new', 'foods', 'establish', 'variety', 'meals', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'found', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'not', 'feeling', 'hungry', 'certainly', 'very', 'healthy', 'way', 'eating', 'planning', 'continue', 'program', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'healthier', 'diet', 'especially', 'are', 'diabetic', 'needing', 'better', 'control', 'eating', 'overweight', 'possiblility', 'becoming', 'diabetic', 'essential']",Tackling Diabetes with Dr. Neal Barnard
