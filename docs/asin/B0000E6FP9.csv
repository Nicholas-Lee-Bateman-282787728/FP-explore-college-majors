How many other shows / movies have there been about a boy and his dog? Plenty (um, remember Lassie?). For these reasons, most people looking for 'serious' entertainment are disappointed in the show. But those people are missing the point: sometimes it is possible (and good) to be entertained by the simple things in life.The stories move at a nice pace. The Happy Ending is the norm. The acting is very good from all involved, particularly from Jaimz Woolvett, who in this role sounds a lot like Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous; set I believe in Montana, the show was actually filmed in New Zealand. Some reviewers have mentioned that the music is a little annoying. The music has that early '90s light rock vibe which I don't mind, though I can see how it could be distracting to some. The show is very clean from a moral standpoint; wholesome family values are the point of most relationships and plots. There is no cursing / sex or anything like that. The level of the writing is probably for kids, ages 9 - 13.I particularly loved the relationship between the dog and the boy, which isafter all the point of the show, but just as much I liked the relationship the kid has with his parents. There is an attempt to guide, while allowing him to develop as a person, combined with a genuine concern with his welfare. It is the kind of program you might have seen on the Family Channel back in the day, like the New World Zorro series with Duncan Regehr. A great show that provides pleasantly simple entertainment.",4,Enjoyable Family Program,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,1661,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'series', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Original', 'plots', 'Not', 'Really', 'How', 'many', 'other', 'shows', '/', 'movies', 'have', 'there', 'been', 'boy', 'dog', 'Plenty', 'um', 'remember', 'Lassie', 'reasons', 'most', 'people', 'looking', ""'serious"", 'entertainment', 'are', 'disappointed', 'show', 'people', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'sometimes', 'possible', 'good', 'be', 'entertained', 'simple', 'things', 'life.The', 'stories', 'move', 'nice', 'pace', 'Happy', 'Ending', 'norm', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'involved', 'particularly', 'Jaimz', 'Woolvett', 'who', 'role', 'lot', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Marty', 'McFly', 'scenery', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'set', 'believe', 'Montana', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'New', 'Zealand', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'music', 'little', 'annoying', 'music', 'early', ""'90s"", 'light', 'rock', 'vibe', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'distracting', 'show', 'very', 'clean', 'moral', 'standpoint', 'wholesome', 'family', 'values', 'are', 'point', 'most', 'relationships', 'plots', 'cursing', '/', 'sex', 'anything', 'level', 'writing', 'probably', 'kids', '9', '13.I', 'particularly', 'loved', 'relationship', 'dog', 'boy', 'isafter', 'point', 'show', 'just', 'much', 'liked', 'relationship', 'kid', 'parents', 'attempt', 'guide', 'allowing', 'develop', 'person', 'combined', 'genuine', 'concern', 'welfare', 'kind', 'program', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'Family', 'Channel', 'back', 'day', 'New', 'World', 'Zorro', 'series', 'Duncan', 'Regehr', 'great', 'show', 'pleasantly', 'simple', 'entertainment']",White Fang

But if you are a young boy, this series has everything you want: Beautiful outdoor scenery, animals of all kinds, some fighting and posturing, lots of drama and happy endings. My son is not old enough to read the Jack London book, but he enjoys this tale of a modern boy and his faithful dog. One thing that irks me is so many of the actors seem to be German and are having problems sounding like rural mountain men. German actors in New Zealand playing mountain men in the Northern Rockies?

I put it on Netflix for background noise one day, and noticed that my dog was extremely interested (she usually doesn't care about the TV, even when animals are on) so I watched a few episodes with her. It's super cheesy. It reminded me of Lassie, but with a wolf-dog hybrid. The dog ""saves the day"" in almost every episode.That being said, I might buy this $5 DVD for my dog... I think it's worth every penny to keep her quietly sitting on the couch, haha. I will say it's a very wholesome show, and I wouldn't mind my kids watching it if they were interested.",2,My dog can't stop watching it...,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,597,"['show', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'put', 'Netflix', 'background', 'noise', 'one', 'day', 'noticed', 'dog', 'was', 'extremely', 'interested', 'usually', ""n't"", 'care', 'TV', 'even', 'when', 'animals', 'are', 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'super', 'cheesy', 'reminded', 'Lassie', 'wolf-dog', 'hybrid', 'dog', 'day', 'almost', 'episode.That', 'being', 'said', 'might', 'buy', '5', 'DVD', 'dog', 'think', 'worth', 'penny', 'keep', 'quietly', 'sitting', 'couch', 'haha', 'will', 'say', 'very', 'wholesome', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'kids', 'watching', 'were', 'interested']",White Fang
