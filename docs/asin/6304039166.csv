397155,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304039166,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Woody Allen has such a brilliantly quirky way with dialog that I am just drawn to everything that he does now, within reason.  I am not biased to his films as many have become.  I love him, truly, and laud him as one of our greatest working directors, but he is not without misstep.Thankfully, `Mighty Aphrodite' is not a misstep.The film tells the story of Lenny, the adoptive father of a genius.  Struggling to find himself within his own marriage, Lenny decides to seek out his son's biological mother and what he finds is not what he imagined.  Linda, a street-walker, is no where near the genius her son is, but there is a humanity within her that strikes Lenny and endears him.  He meets her under the premise of being another `john' but he forms a bond with her that defies the boundaries of her profession.  He becomes a father to her; a mature (seemingly) male figure in her life, which up until that moment was devoid of any real strong male influence (positive at least).  Lenny is able to then exercise his own feelings of inadequacy with his wife through his relationship with Linda; being to her what he could only wish to be for his wife; interesting.`Mighty Aphrodite' is expertly written, as are most (notice I said most) of Allen's films.  This is one of those movies that knows how to grip you and then subtly move you in ways you may not immediately expect; and Allen's grasp of Greek literature (as seen through his inclusion of a Greek Chorus Line) is intelligent and just adds yet another layer to set this movie apart from most other comedies.The acting is also very well done, even if Allen and Sorvino are the only two who truly own the film.  Woody Allen has an acting style that is love or hate.  It's conditional at that, for I love him sometimes and hate him others, even though his style never changes.  It all has to do with the subject and context.  Here he works very well.  Sorvino is even better though, taking that average dumb blonde and giving her a spark not so often seen.  Many have attacked her and this performance for winning the Oscar, and while she was not deserving of that little golden man (how Winslet lost that year is just beyond me) she was very deserving of a nomination.  She is absolutely lovely here.The film is not Allen's finest; don't get me wrong, but there is little to complain about.  It doesn't feel as deeply complete as `Deconstructing Harry' was or as richly relative as `Annie Hall', but it connects with the viewer, and especially the ending has a twist of humanity and realism I didn't expect but utterly enjoyed.It's lighter fare for the Allen supporter; so dig right in and enjoy.",5,A mighty fine example of lightweight brilliance...,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,2654,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'brilliantly', 'quirky', 'way', 'dialog', 'am', 'just', 'drawn', 'everything', 'now', 'reason', 'am', 'not', 'biased', 'films', 'many', 'have', 'become', 'love', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'working', 'directors', 'not', 'misstep.Thankfully', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'not', 'misstep.The', 'film', 'story', 'Lenny', 'adoptive', 'father', 'genius', 'Struggling', 'find', 'own', 'marriage', 'Lenny', 'seek', 'out', 'son', 'biological', 'mother', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'imagined', 'Linda', 'street-walker', 'where', 'genius', 'son', 'humanity', 'Lenny', 'premise', 'being', 'john', 'bond', 'boundaries', 'profession', 'father', 'mature', 'seemingly', 'male', 'figure', 'life', 'up', 'moment', 'was', 'devoid', 'real', 'strong', 'male', 'influence', 'positive', 'least', 'Lenny', 'able', 'then', 'exercise', 'own', 'feelings', 'inadequacy', 'wife', 'relationship', 'Linda', 'being', 'what', 'could', 'only', 'wish', 'be', 'wife', 'interesting.', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'expertly', 'written', 'are', 'most', 'notice', 'said', 'most', 'Allen', 'films', 'one', 'movies', 'how', 'grip', 'then', 'subtly', 'move', 'ways', 'may', 'not', 'immediately', 'expect', 'Allen', 'grasp', 'Greek', 'literature', 'seen', 'inclusion', 'Greek', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'intelligent', 'just', 'yet', 'layer', 'set', 'movie', 'apart', 'most', 'other', 'comedies.The', 'acting', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'Allen', 'Sorvino', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'who', 'truly', 'own', 'film', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'acting', 'style', 'love', 'hate', 'conditional', 'love', 'sometimes', 'hate', 'others', 'even', 'style', 'never', 'changes', 'do', 'subject', 'context', 'Here', 'very', 'well', 'Sorvino', 'even', 'better', 'taking', 'average', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'giving', 'spark', 'not', 'so', 'often', 'seen', 'Many', 'have', 'attacked', 'performance', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'was', 'not', 'deserving', 'little', 'golden', 'man', 'how', 'Winslet', 'lost', 'year', 'just', 'was', 'very', 'deserving', 'nomination', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'here.The', 'film', 'not', 'Allen', 'finest', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'little', 'complain', ""n't"", 'feel', 'deeply', 'complete', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'was', 'richly', 'relative', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'viewer', 'especially', 'ending', 'twist', 'humanity', 'realism', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'utterly', 'enjoyed.It', 'lighter', 'fare', 'Allen', 'supporter', 'dig', 'right', 'enjoy']",Mighty Aphrodite VHS

397158,A20IIR0422G3A5,6304039166,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[25, 27]","`Mighty Aphrodite', written, directed, and starring Woody Allen seems to be the kind of movie Allen makes after he is worn out doing a strictly realistic, mostly serious movie such as `Crimes and Misdemeanors', `Hannah and Her Sisters', and `Husbands and Wives'. Unlike these excellent seriocomic works, `Mighty Aphrodite' flies off into a world of fantasy similar to the crazy / inventive situations in `Zellig' and `A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy'.Allen brings along with him his usual band of big name actors taking off from more remunerative roles to have some fun with this lighthearted comedy. As usual, heavyweights such as F. Murray Abraham, Claire Bloom, Jack Warden, and Olympia Dukakis have such small roles that you hardly notice they are there until they are off screen. In the case of Abraham and Dukakis and Allen stock player David Ogden Stiers, this anonymity is heightened by the fact that they are playing masked members of a Greek chorus, filmed in a ruined Roman amphitheater, in Italy, according to the location credits.This movie was done for Mirimax and a sizable number of new names appear among the film's executive producers, although I am certain Allen still has his hands firmly on the artistic reins for the filming of the movie. I have no idea which of these new names represents `Sweetland Films', but their only contribution seems to have been a slightly less austere credit crawl at the end of the flick.Aside from Allen, all of the really heavy lifting on the screen was done by title character actor Mira Sorvino, and it is beyond me how she was nominated for the supporting actress Academy Award and not in the lead actress category, although I suspect it did improve her chances of winning in the lesser category, which she did.Of Allen's two most important movie subjects, love and death, love is certainly the main issue in this movie, signaled by the fact that Aphrodite is the name of the ancient Greek god of love, represented in this flick by Sorvino's character who is a prostitute and pornographic movie actress who wants to get out of that life and settle down in a more normal setting.Allen plays a successful New York City sportswriter who gets connected with Sorvino when he and his wife decide to adopt a baby boy, and Allen becomes obsessed with the identity of the real mother, who turns out to be Sorvino. While Allen tries to set Sorvino up with a farmer turned boxer turned farmer, his wife (Carter) hooks up with a business partner (Peter Weller) who threatens to break up their marriage.While there are a few brief moments of apparent danger when Sorvino's pimp threatens Allen's life if Sorvino quits, the pimp is bought off with nothing more than a pair of courtside tickets to a Knicks game. While the main `realistic' plot is pretty improbable as it is, the real silliness is going on in asides to a full masked Greek chorus very similar to what you would find in productions of plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Thrown into this absurdity is Jack Warden playing a modern blind man named Tiresius encountered on the streets of New York. The joke is that Tiresius is the name of a character in Sophocles' `Oedipus Rex' who makes the prophecy that Oedipus will kill his father. In Allen's version, Tiresius simply clues Allen into the fact that his wife is fooling around with her business partner.The invocations of the Greek choruses get even more silly as the movie progresses, with the chorus appearing in modern New York near the end of the film, bursting into renditions of Cole Porter and tunes from other modern composers.Like `Zellig', there is no attempt to avoid straining credulity. Near the end of the movie, Sorvino is rescued from her life of sin by a totally improbable `deux ex machina', which Allen glorifies by simply describing it as such in the voice-over.This movie is about as close as Allen ever comes after `Annie Hall' to returning to the silliness of early movies such as `Bananas' and `Sleeper'. Unlike the early gag fests, you really feel for the characters in this movie. You don't want Allen to break up with his wife and you want Sorvino to get out of her sex business. And, we are much happier at the end of the movie than we are at the end of `Crimes and Misdemeanors' where a killer escapes justice and the nebbish gets cheated out of his girlfriend.This is not one of Allen's very best movies, but it is in the upper half. Sorvino's performance is definitely worth the price of admission.",5,Woody's Greek Fantasy. Warm and Funny.

397163,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304039166,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","Mighty Aphrodite (1995) won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for Mira Sorvino, and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay for Woody Allen. Sorvino, the Harvard educated daughter of actor Paul Sorvino, plays a squeaky-voiced, potty mouth hooker. Her character is none too bright, and though she aspires to be an actress, and has appeared in several pornographic films, she is terrible. Somewhat of a stretch, considering that Mira Sorvino is an Academy Award winner, and she graduated magna cum laude from Harvard in East Asian Studies. While at Harvard, she helped found the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, one of Harvard's premier co-ed a cappella groups, not to mention spending a year of study in Beijing. She is fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and also speaks French. The Oscar win is even more impressive when you consider that she was up against Elisabeth Shue. Shue starred as a prostitute in the 1995 film Leaving Las Vegas with Nicolas Cage. Cage won his Oscar, but I guess they liked Sorvino's hooker better. Perhaps because her film had a happy ending? Even if they did employ the 'deux ex machina' to achieve it. I compare her win to Alan Arkin's for his potty mouthed but loveable grandpa in Little Miss Sunshine. Though Sorvino's character, Linda Ash, wasn't too bright, she had a kind of Gracie Allen grace and logic. Like when sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Woody Allen) asks her if she is ever worried that one of her clients will kill her, she replies that she always makes them pay in advance.The plot of this movie is sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Woody Allen) is married to art gallery owner Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter). She decides that she wants to adopt a child, and although reluctant at first, they do, and Lenny is thrilled with the results. Max Weinrib turns out to be such a wonderful kid that Lenny wonders who the really parents are, thinking they must be brilliant. He is obsessed with finding them, and does discover that Linda Ash is Max's biological mother. She is not the Mighty Aphrodite he expected, but once he gets to know her, he gets involved in helping her leave the oldest profession behind for a better life as wife, mother, and hairdresser.The gimmick of this flick is the insertion of a whole Greek Chorus to comment on, question, and decry his choices. The juxtaposition of the ancient and modern is the source of much of the film's humor. At one point they want to call on Zeus for help, but get his answering machine. Another time they advise him, ""Lenny, don't be a schmuck!"" They really went all out, flying the Chorus to Italy to film scenes in actual Roman ruins. F. Murray Abraham is the Chorus leader; Jack Warden is Tiresias; David Ogden Stiers is Laius; and Olympia Dukakis is Jocasta. Olympia Dukakis! You can't get much Greeker than that.Chorus: [referring to Oedipus] Look, here's a man who killed his father and slept with his mother.Jocasta: [(Oedipus' mother)] I hate to tell you what they call my son in Harlem.The parallel to Oedipus is that he was a man who also wanted to know who his real parents were--with disastrous results. But the main reason for this theatrical device is merely to show the inner voices that dialogue in Lenny Weinrib's head. They admonish him not to meddle, and predict disaster, yet he goes ahead anyway, and in spite of their dire warnings, everything seems to work outWhat should have been the main story--the break down of his marriage and his wife's affair with Jerry Bender (Peter Weller) is more of an after thought. Jerry Bender would make a much better match for Amanda, and Woody/Lenny barely puts up a fight. Though only in a few scenes, I was curious about Jerry Bender/Peter Weller. Though best known as the title characters in Robocop and The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, Weller holds a Masters Degree in Roman and Renaissance art, and is an occasional lecturer at Syracuse University on the subjects of Hollywood and the Roman Empire. Weller's favorite musician is Miles Davis and he occasionally plays in a jazz band with Buckaroo Banzai costar Jeff Goldblum. Heck, he would be a better match for Mira Sorvino, even. The fact that his name is so similar to his character's name makes me wonder.In a 2005 interview with ""Vanity Fair"", Woody Allen stated that even after their bitter and much-publicized breakup, he considered casting Mia Farrow as his wife Amanda, saying that he believed she would be the best actress for the role. In response to this, his casting director Juliet Taylor replied, ""What, are you nuts?""Though the role of Jerry Bender was practically a cameo, there are a few other actual cameos that I'd like to mention:Paul Giamatti is effective as an Extras Guild Researcher, long before Sideways, and makes the most of his 15 seconds of screen time. Tony Sirico plays a Boxing Trainer, familiar from The Sopranos, and lately, Denny's commercials. One last cameo that wasn't credited, but I suspect, is Dick Hyman was playing the piano at one of the posh Manhattan parties Lenny and Amanda attended.Dick Hyman (I'll bet they teased him about his name a lot in Junior High) has served as composer/arranger/conductor/pianist for the Woody Allen films Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Broadway Danny Rose, Stardust Memories, Hannah and Her Sisters, Radio Days, Bullets Over Broadway, Mighty Aphrodite, Everyone Says ""I Love You"", Sweet and Lowdown, The Curse Of The Jade Scorpion and Melinda and Melinda. He has been music director of the production The Movie Music of Woody Allen, which premiered at the Hollywood Bowl. The Greek Chorus gave Hyman the opportunity to arrange a fantastic a capella arrangement of Cole Porter's ""You Do Something to Me"" for them in the movie's love scene.Sophocles, The Oedipus Cycle: Oedipus Rex, Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone: If you want to bone up on your Greek tragedies, here is a good place to start.Euripides V: Electra, The Phoenician Women, The Bacchae (The Complete Greek Tragedies): The Bacchae, by Euripides also features the character of blind soothsayer, Tiresias.Aeschylus:  Seven Against Thebes (Duckworth Comapnins to Greek and Roman Tragedy): Tiresias also appears in this little ditty by Aeschylus.Iliad and Odyssey boxed set: Tiresias also appears in blind Greek bard Homer's epic tales to give advice to Ulysses.The Divine Comedy (The Inferno, The Purgatorio, and The Paradiso): In The Divine Comedy (Inferno, Canto XX), Dante sees Tiresias in the fourth pit of the eighth circle of Hell (the circle is for perpetrators of fraud and the fourth pit being the location for soothsayers or diviners.)Complete Works of Alfred Lord Tennyson.  (100+ Works) FREE Author's biography and poems in the trial version: ""Tiresias"" is the title of a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson.The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts Including the Annotations of Ezra Pound: Tiresias is an integral voice in T. S. Eliot's poem, The Waste Land.Joyce: Ulysses (Landmarks of World Literature (New)): This work by James Joyce is said to parallel the Odyssey by Homer.O Brother, Where Art Thou?: During the opening scenes of O Brother Where Art Thou, a derivative of Odyssey, Tiresias is introduced as an old black man on a railroad handcar. Although when asked his name he states ""I have no name.""All the Right Changes: Pianist Dick Hyman is a master of many musical styles, from early to modern jazz.

397165,A39AKB7OM66L44,6304039166,Darnell R. Johnson,"[3, 6]","The key to a great Woody Allen film is always the dialogue. It made Annie Hall a bizarre take on a very originalidea. But that is the charm of Woody Allen, he takes everyday things completely twists them up with wit and satire and the overallproduct is something both entertaining and very nicely polished.Here he takes adoption by the horns ...  Anyway, he's married to Helena Bonham Carter they decide to have a baby, they do, they love it and thensuddenly Woody wants to meet the boy's mother.What Woody discovers is that the boy's mother is a adult actress wanting to make it big that has starred in the mostoutrageous of pornos and is now working in prostitution. Except, she doesn't work the streets she more rather, makes appointments ...Woody becomes enamored by the prostitute mostly because she's a colorful character and he can't believe sheconceived his son. They come close to falling in love, but it's more of a fascination than anything. (typical Woody move)Here, he connects the story in tune with Greek mythology, there are hilarious scenes in which Woody consults with the Gods asto what to do.Mira Sorvino, who plays the prostitute, won a Well deserved Oscar for her performance. She completely holds theaudience by the throat with her ditzy hooker with a big heart. The reason I loved this movie so much was the exchange of advice.Woody with the Gods, and then his relationship with the hooker. His relationship with his actual wife in the movie is sort of side-plottedand isn't very important but maybe it is. Maybe Woody was showing sub-consciously even, that sometimes you can go looking foryour baby's mother and you wonder if it's the power between you raising it and her inner feelings as a mother, to be a replacementfor an unhappy marriage? That sounds complicated and I must admit is trivial to the plot, but I sort of felt sorry for Woody in this film.The bond between him and Mira Sorvino developed in something more than lust and love, it was almost like finding your best friend.The dialogue in this film is particularly mature, filled with curse words and extremely perverse references the film isunsuitable for children of any age and might offend those who enjoy Woody Allen movies and expect a sweet tale. Just a warning,the language is very graphic. I'd also like to mention Michael Turturro's performance as the dumb boxer, suits him well and he makeshim a lovely addition to this almost perfect film.",5,"Mighty Fine , Mr. Allen",1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2440,"['key', 'great', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'always', 'dialogue', 'made', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'bizarre', 'take', 'very', 'originalidea', 'charm', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'everyday', 'things', 'completely', 'up', 'wit', 'satire', 'overallproduct', 'something', 'entertaining', 'very', 'nicely', 'adoption', 'horns', 'Anyway', 'married', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'decide', 'have', 'baby', 'do', 'love', 'thensuddenly', 'Woody', 'meet', 'boy', 'mother.What', 'Woody', 'boy', 'mother', 'adult', 'actress', 'wanting', 'make', 'big', 'starred', 'mostoutrageous', 'pornos', 'now', 'working', 'prostitution', ""n't"", 'work', 'streets', 'more', 'rather', 'appointments', 'Woody', 'enamored', 'prostitute', 'mostly', 'colorful', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'sheconceived', 'son', 'come', 'close', 'falling', 'love', 'more', 'fascination', 'anything', 'typical', 'Woody', 'move', 'Here', 'story', 'tune', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'are', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'Woody', 'consults', 'Gods', 'what', 'do.Mira', 'Sorvino', 'who', 'prostitute', 'won', 'Well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'completely', 'theaudience', 'throat', 'ditzy', 'hooker', 'big', 'heart', 'reason', 'loved', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'exchange', 'advice.Woody', 'Gods', 'then', 'relationship', 'hooker', 'relationship', 'actual', 'wife', 'movie', 'sort', 'side-plottedand', ""n't"", 'very', 'important', 'Maybe', 'Woody', 'was', 'showing', 'sub-consciously', 'even', 'sometimes', 'can', 'go', 'looking', 'foryour', 'baby', 'mother', 'wonder', 'power', 'raising', 'inner', 'feelings', 'mother', 'be', 'replacementfor', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'complicated', 'must', 'admit', 'trivial', 'plot', 'sort', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Woody', 'film.The', 'bond', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'developed', 'something', 'more', 'lust', 'love', 'was', 'almost', 'finding', 'best', 'friend.The', 'dialogue', 'film', 'particularly', 'mature', 'filled', 'curse', 'words', 'extremely', 'perverse', 'references', 'film', 'isunsuitable', 'children', 'age', 'might', 'offend', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'expect', 'sweet', 'tale', 'Just', 'warning', 'language', 'very', 'graphic', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'mention', 'Michael', 'Turturro', 'performance', 'dumb', 'boxer', 'suits', 'well', 'lovely', 'addition', 'almost', 'perfect', 'film']",Mighty Aphrodite VHS

Here's a brief list:1. Mira Sorvino plays the entire movie in a high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking. Another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard. Maybe in 1995, because she was new, the Academy didn't realize that this wasn't her real voice and took pity on her....2. Stupid plot device of the Greek Chorus.3. Stupid happy ending with a twist.4. Lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies.....while this movie is not itself a porn flick, the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it NOT a movie for families to watch.5. Odd sight of a very old and wrinkly Woody Allen (with dyed hair and bald spot) making out with TWO women young enough to be his granddaughters.....all right, so I'm just jealous - Woody still looks gross....6. Cliched, poorly developed characters, a plotline that goes around in circles, and lots and lots of pointless, unfunny dialogue.In summary, this movie is bad, bad, bad......",1,"Awful movie...ditto on ""WHAT WAS THE ACADEMY THINKING?!""",1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,2113,"['So', 'was', 'breakout', 'movie', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'one', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', '1995.This', 'movie', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'just', 'had', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'competitors', 'were', '1995', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'category.Let', 'see', '..according', 'Wikipedia', 'were', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlin', '13', 'fairly', 'standard', 'worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger', 'role', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'Georgia', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'one', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Nixon', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'play', 'wooden', 'Pat', 'Nixon', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Sense', 'Sensibilities', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'either', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'was', 'robbed', 'Academy', 'here', 'also', 'only', 'just', 'how', 'few', 'good', 'roles', 'are', 'women', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'could', 'win', 'Oscar', 'sort', 'performance.And', 'was', 'beginning', 'warm', 'up', 'too', 'was', 'great', 'Romy', 'Michele', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', 'terrific', 'also', 'Beautiful', 'Girls', '.So', 'what', 'exactly', 'so', 'bad', 'movie', 'Here', 'brief', 'list:1', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'entire', 'movie', 'high-pitched', 'falsetto', 'voice', 'breaking', 'reviewer', 'described', 'similar', 'listening', 'fingernails', 'blackboard', 'Maybe', '1995', 'was', 'new', 'Academy', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'voice', 'took', 'pity', '.2', 'Stupid', 'plot', 'device', 'Greek', 'Chorus.3', 'Stupid', 'happy', 'ending', 'twist.4', 'Lots', 'profanity', 'dialogue', 'explicit', 'descriptions', 'sex', 'acts', 'done', 'pornography', 'movies', 'movie', 'not', 'porn', 'flick', 'explicit', 'details', 'porn', 'industry', 'included', 'dialogue', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'movie', 'families', 'watch.5', 'Odd', 'sight', 'very', 'old', 'wrinkly', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'dyed', 'hair', 'bald', 'spot', 'making', 'out', 'TWO', 'women', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'granddaughters', '..all', 'right', ""'m"", 'just', 'jealous', 'Woody', 'still', 'gross', '.6', 'Cliched', 'poorly', 'developed', 'characters', 'plotline', 'around', 'circles', 'lots', 'lots', 'pointless', 'unfunny', 'dialogue.In', 'summary', 'movie', 'bad', 'bad', 'bad']",Mighty Aphrodite VHS

397168,A15TNUM2PBS6F0,6304039166,"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover""","[4, 17]","After watching this film on cable recently, I am glad I waited that long to see it.  I like Woody Allen's films, and am usually quite amused by them.  He has a few unfunny films, and this is undoubtedly the worst!  The worst part of this film is the pathetic and extremely annoying performance by Mira Sorvino.  I am not a big fan of her, but I was curious to see her performance as she had won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  It was horrendous.  What was the academy thinking?  She was more than annoying, and what was up with the voice?  She is known for making up strange voices for her roles (Romy, in Romy and Michelle's High school Reunion, and her awful attempt at playing Marilyn Monroe).  The story wasn't bad, Woody Allen, Lenny and Helen Bonham Carter, (i don't remember her character's name but she thinks she is Judy Davis) are a married couple who adopt a baby and when the child develops his intelligence, Woody is on a rampage to find out who this child's real mother is.  The real mother is Mira Sorvino, who is a porn actress, trying to get a real acting job, and she also turns tricks.  Woody goes out of his way to get to know her and help her to turn her life around so if his son Max does decide to ever look up his real mother she will be a more respectable person.

397169,A2BPDFR58H9575,6304039166,Galina,"[3, 4]","""Mighty Aphrodite"" (1995), Woody Allen's hilarious yet moving and surprisingly optimistic film can be viewed as a modern retelling of the ancient tragedy ""Oedipus"". Like Oedipus in Sophocles's play who became obsessed with discovering identity of his real parents which led to the most horrifying results, Lenny Weinrib (Allen) wants to find the real mother of his and his wife Amanda's adopted son Max who turned to be a brilliant and incredibly gifted boy. The search brings him to Linda, a small time porn star and a hooker with whom Lenny becomes friends and tries to persuade her to change her life. Mira Sorvino as a naive dumb blonde with a high pitch voice is mighty fine and she more than deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting role. She is convincing and very sweet, and there is not a single wrong note in her acting. Once again, I am fascinated by Allen's ability to work with his actors and to bring the best in them when they perform in his movies. Allen was hilarious trying to resist Sorvino's advances in their first scene together. Not to let us forget that we are in the realm of Greek tra-medy, Allen employs the characters from Greek mythology who comment on and even participate in the events. Among then, the blind seer Tiresias who can see the developing problems in Lenny's marriage better than Lenny himself, ""Miss Party Pooper"", Cassandra who was cursed to always predict the truth but no one would ever believe her, and the ancient chorus whose leader (Murray Abraham) desperately tries to stop Lenny from finding the truth by begging him in the best traditions of Greek tragedy, ""Lenny please don't be a schmuck!"" :)",4,"""Of all human weaknesses, obsession is the most dangerous, and the silliest!""",1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,1645,"['Mighty', 'Aphrodite', '1995', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'moving', 'surprisingly', 'optimistic', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'modern', 'retelling', 'ancient', 'tragedy', 'Oedipus', 'Oedipus', 'Sophocles', 'play', 'who', 'became', 'obsessed', 'discovering', 'identity', 'real', 'parents', 'led', 'most', 'horrifying', 'results', 'Lenny', 'Weinrib', 'Allen', 'find', 'real', 'mother', 'wife', 'Amanda', 'adopted', 'son', 'Max', 'who', 'turned', 'be', 'brilliant', 'incredibly', 'gifted', 'boy', 'search', 'Linda', 'small', 'time', 'porn', 'star', 'hooker', 'whom', 'Lenny', 'friends', 'tries', 'persuade', 'change', 'life', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'naive', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'high', 'pitch', 'voice', 'mighty', 'fine', 'more', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'role', 'convincing', 'very', 'sweet', 'not', 'single', 'wrong', 'note', 'acting', 'Once', 'again', 'am', 'fascinated', 'Allen', 'ability', 'work', 'actors', 'bring', 'best', 'when', 'perform', 'movies', 'Allen', 'was', 'hilarious', 'trying', 'resist', 'Sorvino', 'advances', 'first', 'scene', 'together', 'Not', 'let', 'forget', 'are', 'realm', 'Greek', 'tra-medy', 'Allen', 'characters', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'who', 'comment', 'even', 'participate', 'events', 'then', 'blind', 'seer', 'Tiresias', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'developing', 'problems', 'Lenny', 'marriage', 'better', 'Lenny', 'Miss', 'Party', 'Pooper', 'Cassandra', 'who', 'was', 'cursed', 'always', 'predict', 'truth', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'believe', 'ancient', 'chorus', 'leader', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'desperately', 'stop', 'Lenny', 'finding', 'truth', 'begging', 'best', 'traditions', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'Lenny', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'schmuck']",Mighty Aphrodite VHS

The undertaken invective around the Greek meaning of Aphrodite and the way he wisely bounds the concept respect the pros in the world of today is by itself worthy to hail.The initial shot focuses on a Greek temple and the chorus (smart device in the Greek Tragedy  at the moment to begin the whole drama)  works out as an accurate introduction respect the story which is about to be told.From Greece we fly to New York where the couple in question (Mrs. Bonham Carter  and Mr. Allen are discussing about having a child. But when she decides to adopt a baby, the first clues are given to us. Notice for instance the clever dialogue in which his son asks him: ""Who has the authority in this house?"" he replies: ""I have it but your mother is who takes the decisions"" clearly is suggesting - laughs apart - we have always lived the invisible domain of the woman in the marriage 8 and very specially into the Jew tradition).Then, comes the nucleus of the film: he decides tries to find the real  mother of this vary smart boy (From unknown origin; that reciprocal interest catches the our plain attention, so when he takes a ride he finds with (Oh, majuscule surprise she is our contemporary Aphrodite: Lisa Walsh (my always loved Mira Sorvino in a role who deserved her the Academy Award as Best Supporting actress).Needless to say. I guess that Allen is telling us that contrarily to the cold theory and ancestral tradition, Aphrodite and Athena are not two isolated archetypes; on the contrary they must be thought (As in the case of Dionysus and Apollo) a complex but united entity.The rest of the film is concerned with the process of redemption, his decision has been taken, he feels it's the time to be a passive spectator to become in part of the play. He feels her invaluable son must be accompanied of transformation and so, he will fight for getting her a good candidate for her to get married (and so become the Mother Goddess).So, you have the eternal dilemma of Pygmalion: to cement and crown the feminine role the blended role of Athena , Aphrodite and Mother Goddess. It's to say, what he (as  many men all over the world are pursuing conscious or not) has always wished : to gather all these archetypes in just one woman: a sublime ideal if you may, but the epic effort has to be made in order to make the possibility becomes real, due the process is by far, much more important that the goal by itself.At least this searching have been intended in many previous films such as Annie Hall. Manhattan, Hannah and her sisters and more recently Melinda and Melinda and Whatever works.So, beneath the hilarious situations plenty of incisive and bleak humour these reflections permeate the whole picture, making it a well rounded masterpiece.Watch it and enjoy it over and over again.",5,The dilemma of eternal feminine!,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2855,"['Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'far', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'Allen', 'movies', 'undertaken', 'invective', 'Greek', 'meaning', 'Aphrodite', 'way', 'wisely', 'concept', 'respect', 'pros', 'world', 'today', 'worthy', 'hail.The', 'initial', 'shot', 'Greek', 'temple', 'chorus', 'smart', 'device', 'Greek', 'Tragedy', 'moment', 'begin', 'whole', 'drama', 'out', 'accurate', 'introduction', 'respect', 'story', 'be', 'told.From', 'Greece', 'fly', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'couple', 'question', 'Mrs.', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'are', 'discussing', 'having', 'child', 'when', 'adopt', 'baby', 'first', 'clues', 'are', 'given', 'Notice', 'instance', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'son', 'Who', 'authority', 'house', 'have', 'mother', 'who', 'decisions', 'clearly', 'suggesting', 'laughs', 'apart', 'have', 'always', 'lived', 'invisible', 'domain', 'woman', 'marriage', '8', 'very', 'specially', 'Jew', 'tradition', '.Then', 'nucleus', 'film', 'tries', 'find', 'real', 'mother', 'vary', 'smart', 'boy', 'unknown', 'origin', 'reciprocal', 'interest', 'plain', 'attention', 'so', 'when', 'ride', 'Oh', 'majuscule', 'surprise', 'contemporary', 'Aphrodite', 'Lisa', 'Walsh', 'always', 'loved', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'role', 'who', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'actress', '.Needless', 'say', 'guess', 'Allen', 'telling', 'contrarily', 'cold', 'theory', 'ancestral', 'tradition', 'Aphrodite', 'Athena', 'are', 'not', 'two', 'isolated', 'archetypes', 'contrary', 'must', 'be', 'thought', 'case', 'Dionysus', 'Apollo', 'complex', 'united', 'entity.The', 'rest', 'film', 'concerned', 'process', 'redemption', 'decision', 'been', 'taken', 'time', 'be', 'passive', 'spectator', 'become', 'part', 'play', 'invaluable', 'son', 'must', 'be', 'accompanied', 'transformation', 'so', 'will', 'fight', 'getting', 'good', 'candidate', 'get', 'married', 'so', 'become', 'Mother', 'Goddess', '.So', 'have', 'eternal', 'dilemma', 'Pygmalion', 'cement', 'crown', 'feminine', 'role', 'blended', 'role', 'Athena', 'Aphrodite', 'Mother', 'Goddess', 'say', 'what', 'many', 'men', 'world', 'are', 'pursuing', 'conscious', 'not', 'always', 'wished', 'gather', 'archetypes', 'just', 'one', 'woman', 'sublime', 'ideal', 'may', 'epic', 'effort', 'be', 'made', 'order', 'make', 'possibility', 'real', 'due', 'process', 'far', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'goal', 'itself.At', 'least', 'searching', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'many', 'previous', 'films', 'such', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'Hannah', 'sisters', 'more', 'recently', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'Whatever', 'works.So', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'plenty', 'incisive', 'bleak', 'humour', 'reflections', 'permeate', 'whole', 'picture', 'making', 'well', 'rounded', 'masterpiece.Watch', 'enjoy', 'over', 'again']",Mighty Aphrodite VHS

Featuring a relatively unknown actress, who graduated from California State University Fresno, as the supporting actress - who provides a relatively convincing performance as the naive but cute dumb blonde, the movie revolves around Woody's growing relationship with her and the increasing interest he has in seeing her take a different turn in career, and secure a decent job that does not involve prostituting herself, and hence introducing her to a guy from the farm who is oblivious of her past but eventually spurns her upon realizing that she has had sex with an inordinate number of men.The narrative of the movie is told in an iconoclastic style with a Roman setting comprising a chorus of people clad in Roman garb putting things to question and beseeching Zeus for divine intervention, with Woody occasionally stepping into the picture to engage in a tete-a-tete with them and even features a blind Tiresias, the entire narrative intervention being interspersed throughout the movie.A finely crafted and unique movie to watch.

Bernabo,"[5, 7]","I told friends that they would enjoy &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; a lot more if they watching &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; because then they would get all the great in-jokes that had to do with the Bard (rather than the relatively lame ones having to do with Hollywood).  Unfortunately, I think that to really get the most out of Woody Allen's &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; you have to have a really good understanding of classical Greek tragedy, which would involve much more than screening &quot;Oedipus Rex.&quot;  I mean some of the funniest moments in this film involve &quot;komos,&quot; which is when the chorus engages in a lyrical dialogue with one of the characters and make brief comments or inquiries during the course of an episode.  Now, people might have heard about hubris and know a chorus when they seen one, but when a film starts dealing with koros (excessive self-reliance), harmartia (the protagonist's tragic flaw/error of judgment), and Sophoclean irony, I have to think we are talking more misses than hits.  So let me just assure you, that Allen plays with the elements of Greek tragedy in a way that would have Aristophanes laughing, not to mention the Classics department at an Ivy League university.Fortunately, the film is also funny for those who do not know the difference between anagnorisis and mimesis.  Mira Sorvino steals the show in her Oscar winning performance as the bubble-headed hooker that Woody has tracked down in a quest to find the birth mother of his adopted child.  F. Murray Abraham is the Choragos (sorry, that's the leader of the chorus in ancient Greek drama), who provides the commentary on Woody's ill-fated actions.  David Odgen Stiers, Olympia Dukakis and Jack Warden are mythical figures come to life to lend a touch of class to the proceedings.  This is not a great Woody Allen film, of which we have had plenty, but the decision to cast the story of Lenny Weintrib as a Greek tragedy was a masterstroke which makes this little film worth watching more than once.  Besides, there is nothing like showing the beginning of the film (after the credits of course) to a group of students beginning a study of Greek tragedy and watching their jaws drop when they realize it is a Woody Allen movie.

397184,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,6304039166,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[5, 7]","MIGHTY APHRODITE is Woody Allen's wildly successful stab at Greek comedy/tragedy. He stars as Lenny Weinrib, a sportswriter married to ambitious Amanda Sloan (Helena Bonham Carter), who desperately wants her own art gallery in New York City and is willing to play the game to get it. Amanda convinces a reluctant Lenny to adopt, and they end up with a beautiful baby boy they decide to name Max. He grows up to be bright and very intelligent for his age, so Lenny becomes obsessed with finding out who Max's biological parents are. O course, he is not exactly happy when he discovers that the mother is a high-pitched actress wanna-be who is also a minor porn star and hooker (Mira Sorvino, in an Oscar-winning performance). Lenny is determined to turn her life around--but at the same time is forced to examine his own marriage, which is slowly falling apart.Allen intersperses New York City vignettes with hysterical scenes of a Greek chorus, led by F. Murray Abraham, chiming in about Lenny's life, comparing it to Greek drama, and breaking out into song-and-dance numbers. It works exceptionally well and adds a fascinating element to the already intriguing plot.The film is not for all tastes, but it is wonderfully written, witty, incisive, and funny. It is a charmingly light comedy full of delicious performances and cleverly executed dialogue. Woody Allen delivers a film that is fascinating on all levels and as beautifully structured as a glorious piece of art.

397185,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6304039166,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Mighty Aphrodite is one of Woody Allen's better films. It has great acting by a wonderful cast; and there's an interesting plot moving along at a very good pace. The cinematography and choreography are both excellent throughout the film; and the editing was very well done. There's not too much that could have been cut here!When the action begins, we see Lenny and Amanda Weinrib (Woody Allen and Helena Bonham Carter) having dinner in a fancy restaurant with some friends who are expecting a baby. Amanda says she wants a child, too; but at first Lenny balks. When Amanda suggests an adoption, Lenny very reluctantly gives in--but when Lenny sees their newborn adopted son for the first time he instantly loves his song very tenderly.As time passes, the Weinribs live their lives; and it becomes abundantly clear that their young son Max is brilliant. Max gets into a very special school for gifted children and he can handle it all. Eventually Lenny wants to know just why their son Max (Jimmy McQuaid) is so especially bright.  Lenny goes to the adoption agency he and Amanda used to find out just who are Max's biological parents. All he initially gets is a rather standard answer that they can't give out any information except that there was only a mother and no father involved; but when Lenny steals the adoption file he becomes obsessed with finding Max's biological mother.And he does find her. She's Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino), the kind of actress who makes adult films with men. In addition, she isn't exactly the brightest candle in the chandelier, either. This amazes and even slightly horrifies Lenny at first; but he pays for time with Linda (since that is her business as well) and eventually Lenny and Linda actually form a true friendship. Lenny tries hard to find a suitable man for Linda so that he can ""reform"" her; he knows that one day his son Max may want to know Linda and Lenny doesn't want Max to find out that his mother was living this lifestyle.After some trouble with a man who takes a percentage of what Linda makes (ahem) and some fast sales talk, Lenny thinks he may have found a suitable man for Linda named Kevin (Michael Rapaport). Kevin just might be the man who can take Linda away from Manhattan and give her a new lease on life. Kevin's a boxer but he yearns to return soon to his upstate New York farm so that he can get out of New York City himself.The plot can go anywhere from here. As it turns out, Kevin and Linda don't stay together--will Linda find a man on her own? What about the fact that Lenny's wife has been secretly sharing romantic time alone with her business associate Jerry Bender (Peter Weller)? Will Lenny and Amanda be able to patch up their differences? Watch and find out!Of course, there's also the theme of the ""Greek Chorus"" running throughout the film; they function primarily as narrators from time to time. Much can be made of their significance; and kudos to those reviewers who wrote about this angle of the film.Overall, Mighty Aphrodite showcases the wonderful talents of the actors in this movie although Michael Rapaport could have received a little more screen time. The idea of using the ""Greek Chorus"" to narrate and highlight what was running through Lenny Weinrib's mind was very clever and this worked well. I highly recommend this fine motion picture for anyone who enjoys good quality comedy with excellent acting.",5,"a very good film with plenty of OCD---""obsessive comedy disorder""",1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,3399,"['Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'better', 'films', 'great', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'interesting', 'plot', 'moving', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'are', 'excellent', 'film', 'editing', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'here', 'When', 'action', 'see', 'Lenny', 'Amanda', 'Weinrib', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'having', 'dinner', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'baby', 'Amanda', 'child', 'too', 'first', 'Lenny', 'balks', 'When', 'Amanda', 'adoption', 'Lenny', 'very', 'reluctantly', 'when', 'Lenny', 'newborn', 'adopted', 'son', 'first', 'time', 'instantly', 'song', 'very', 'tenderly.As', 'time', 'passes', 'Weinribs', 'live', 'lives', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'young', 'son', 'Max', 'brilliant', 'Max', 'very', 'special', 'school', 'gifted', 'children', 'can', 'handle', 'Eventually', 'Lenny', 'know', 'just', 'why', 'son', 'Max', 'Jimmy', 'McQuaid', 'so', 'especially', 'bright', 'Lenny', 'adoption', 'agency', 'Amanda', 'used', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'Max', 'biological', 'parents', 'initially', 'rather', 'standard', 'answer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'out', 'information', 'was', 'only', 'mother', 'father', 'involved', 'when', 'Lenny', 'adoption', 'file', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'Max', 'biological', 'mother.And', 'find', 'Linda', 'Ash', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'kind', 'actress', 'who', 'adult', 'films', 'men', 'addition', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'brightest', 'candle', 'chandelier', 'either', 'even', 'slightly', 'Lenny', 'first', 'time', 'Linda', 'business', 'well', 'eventually', 'Lenny', 'Linda', 'actually', 'form', 'true', 'friendship', 'Lenny', 'hard', 'find', 'suitable', 'man', 'Linda', 'so', 'can', 'reform', 'one', 'day', 'son', 'Max', 'may', 'want', 'know', 'Linda', 'Lenny', ""n't"", 'want', 'Max', 'find', 'out', 'mother', 'was', 'living', 'lifestyle.After', 'trouble', 'man', 'who', 'percentage', 'what', 'Linda', 'ahem', 'fast', 'sales', 'talk', 'Lenny', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'suitable', 'man', 'Linda', 'named', 'Kevin', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'Kevin', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'Linda', 'away', 'Manhattan', 'give', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'Kevin', 'boxer', 'return', 'soon', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'farm', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'himself.The', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'out', 'Kevin', 'Linda', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'together', 'will', 'Linda', 'find', 'man', 'own', 'What', 'fact', 'Lenny', 'wife', 'been', 'secretly', 'sharing', 'romantic', 'time', 'alone', 'business', 'associate', 'Jerry', 'Bender', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'Will', 'Lenny', 'Amanda', 'be', 'able', 'patch', 'up', 'differences', 'Watch', 'find', 'out', 'course', 'also', 'theme', 'Greek', 'Chorus', 'running', 'film', 'function', 'primarily', 'narrators', 'time', 'time', 'Much', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'significance', 'kudos', 'reviewers', 'who', 'wrote', 'angle', 'film.Overall', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'wonderful', 'talents', 'actors', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'could', 'have', 'received', 'little', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'idea', 'using', 'Greek', 'Chorus', 'narrate', 'highlight', 'what', 'was', 'running', 'Lenny', 'Weinrib', 'mind', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'worked', 'well', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fine', 'motion', 'picture', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'quality', 'comedy', 'excellent', 'acting']",Mighty Aphrodite VHS

Compared with today's major movies the plot  and the comments made on it just seem a bit tired and cliched. There is the  typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending, but we have never really  plumbed any great depths to get there.

Woody Allen is a clever man, and indeed there are several good zingers, but each one is repeated in such a juvenile manner that I fear Mr. Allen doesn't give his audience enough credit for getting it the first time.For example, there is a scene where Woody is matchmaking two idiots.  He declines their invitation to join them by saying, &quot;No, thank you. I'm superfluous.&quot;  To which one idiot replies, &quot;Oh, you're not feeling well?&quot;  What a great zinger! But then he belabors the joke by going on: &quot;No, SUPERFLUOUS.  Uh... superfluous means unneccessary... I'd only get in the way...&quot; This sort of audience-coddling continues throughout the movie, right up to the end, where even the final scene is amended with a clumsy explanation for the dim-witted. The movie ends with the same gag (a Broadway-Greek chorus) that has already been done 3 times in the last 95 minutes. We got it the first time, Woody.Acting? You'll hardly notice.

Wong,"[1, 2]","Someone said that Mighty Aphrodite is a not an excellent production as it attempts to put in the ancient Greek elements, but fails to follow the formula of tragedy. But, what I can't disagree more is that Woody Allen did not intend to produce a tragedy. What I believe is that the director transforms thegenre of ancient Greek tragedy by making it humourous and comical. Remember what the ending of the movie tells us? ""Keep smiling because the whole world will smile with you"".There is no dull scene in the movie. Every line is elaborately and carefully written - with wit.

397196,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6304039166,Randy Keehn,"[3, 4]","I am a fan of Woody Allen films.  Like most people, I got interested in his early comedy films and then appreciated his development into a master of serious film.  Occasionally, Allen bring the serious and the comedic together in a film that simultaneously cracks you up while amazing you in his innovative method of conveying a message.  ""Mighty Aphrodite"" is an example of this successful mix.  I remember the movie from the 1995 Academy Awards when Mira Sorvino won the Best Supporting Actress Award (and her father's touching reaction).  However, I never had the chance to see the movie until it was on the Independent Film Channel last night.  I was surprised by the opening scenes but I quickly came to appreciate the somewhat wacky Greek chorus.  As the movie moved along, I got a bigger and bigger kick out of the chorus's persistent reappearance.The basic story line was about a couple who adopts an infant child. The reluctant father becomes more and more absorbed in the many fine qualities of his son.  He becomes obsessively curious about the boy's biological mother and manages to track her down.  What he finds destroys his image of what she should be.  Nonetheless, he can't shake this obsessive involvement in her life.Mira Sorvino truly earned her Oscar for her preformance.  She was so uniquely inappropriate that the comedy had trouble keeping up with her.  I usually disdain the profanities of modern cinema but I have to acknowledge that, in ""Mighty Aphrodite"", the profane and obscene really added to the story.  Ultimately the movie comes to an end in which almost all is well.  In the process we discover that it is best to leave well enough alone, you can't make silk out of a sow's ear, true love takes commitment, and a variety of other messages.I rated this movie ""4 Stars"" mainly because most of Woody Allen's comedies are funnier and most of his serous films are more profound.

397199,A3P6XT8Y1FEF3,6304039166,Seamus,"[0, 1]","It's easy to break Woody's directing career into three phases.  Early career, which would be the seventies movies with Diane Keaton.  The mid-career phase was the eighties and early-nineties, including all of the films with Mia Farrow.  And late career would be everything after that, up through the latest films with Scarlett Johansson.Of the later films, this one is often considered the best--though you could certainly make a case for ""Deconstructing Harry,"" or even ""Sweet and Lowdown.""  This one is certainly the best of his later films that might be called a straight comedy.Woody's experimented with almost every type of movie: slap stick (Bananas), musical (Everyone Says I Love you), fake biopic (Zelig), Fellini inspired (Stardust Memories), Bergman inspired (Another woman), whodunnit (Manhattan Murder Mystery), etc, etc, etc.  On this one he found something truly inspired--he blended the elements of Greek tragedy with a Woody Allen comedy--and it worked.The story here doesn't have the layers of a film like ""Hannah and Her Sisters.""  It's a comedy about a couple who adopt a child.  Woody plays the father, and he becomes obsessed with learning about the child's real mother.  After building her up in his mind, he's let down to discover she's a call girl, so he takes it upon himself to make her life better, and comedy ensues.Mira Sorvino won an Oscar for her role, and there is good supporting performances from F. Murray Abraham and Helena Bonham Carter, but what really makes this movie is the idea of a Greek Chorus narrating the tale and gradually taking a larger role then you'll ever find in ""Oedipus"" as they become more and more involved in Allen's decision making.

I had wanted to see this film for a long time. It was much different than I ever thought it would be. Very different, very funny and very well acted.Of course Woody Allen is Woody Allen, which I've come to expect in ALL of his films. Allen and his wife, played by Helena Bonham Carter are thinking about adopting a baby. Of course Allen doesn't want to. So...they do. After years of having this child, they are great parents and are living a good life. But when Allen starts to become obsessed about finding out who his son's real mother is, it takes him to the edge. That's where he meets a quirky prostitute, who goes by the name of Judy Cum (played wonderfully by Mira Sorvino). This is his son's mother. He wants to change her life, make her life a better one so when, and if his son ever finds out this is his mother he won't be ashamed. As Allen and Carter's relationship grows apart, a romance begins with Sorvino and of course Woody Allen tragic comedy insues.The film is built around a Greek play that is happening. These players in the Greek play are advisors to Allen's life. They help him make choices and give him advice, which he rarely takes. It was a very nice, original and unique spin which made the movie that much better. All in all it's a pretty much relaxed, semi-funny, comedy-drama about second changes, marital issues, children, and living up to your dreams.

Mira Sorvino's performance was anything but, oscar worthy. I guess she just got lucky, and the academy gave her the oscar for best supporting actress( over Elisabeth Shue, who actually deserved to win for her performance in ""Leaving Las Vegas"").The movie is about an old man named Lenny (played by Woody Allen), he is a sportswriter as well. He is married to a younger woman named Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter), they decide to adopt a son. As the son grows older he turns out to be a genius. Lenny soon becomes determined to find out who the birth parents are. He goes through hell to get to it, finally he finds Linda Ash(Mira Sorvino), she is actually a porn-star and a prostitute with a squeaky voice. He can't believe it at first, but as he gets to know her he forms a deep connection with her.The story also in a way is told in the form of the greek play ""Oedipus"". I kind of felt that Allen was mocking the greek tragedy and adding his own twist to it. Lenny starts to discuss his options with the people who are acting in the play, it is extremely stupid. Meanwhile, Lenny's marriage is falling apart, as Amanda is cheating on him with another man. Their sexual life is drying up as well. The movie turns out to be pointless, Lenny just tries to get Linda out of her prostitution and into a better life, in a way he succeeds.The movie was just really pointless. Sorry, but it just a coincedence that I just don't like any movie that Woody Allen stars in, because he is just not a good actor. The only good movie that Woody Allen has ever done-that I think so, is ""Match Point"". I don't understand why all the top critics such as Roger Ebert, and Los Angeles times, are raving about Sorvino's performance in the film. It wasn't that great. There are so many other memorable performances of actresses that portray prostitutes such as Elisabeth Shue in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", who lost the oscar for best supporting actress to Sorvino. Kim Basinger's performance in ""L.A. Confidential"" was great and it was scene stealing as well. She played a prostitute who had a warm heart, she deserved the oscar. Woody Allen, I'm sorry to say is just losing his touch in directing. I don't feel that he was any good to begin with. ""Annie Hall"", was pretty boring I gotta say. As was several of his other films.

On the other hand, judged by his own exceptionally high standard of film-making, he can be pretty hit-and-miss. This one is a sure hit. Mighty Aphrodite is a modern myth, ingeniously told through the lens of classical Greek mythology, about a man who sets out on the fabulous quest for beauty. Woody is a father who tries to find the mother of his adopted son, in the belief that the mother of the child he idolizes will represent perfection. As always in Woody's world, things don't quite turn out as planned.Mira Sorvino is charming, and Woody is - well, WOODY. This also features one of Dick Hyman's best scores (arranged from a number of jazz classics, as usual). And, as ever, one of America's greatest directors skillfully blends fantasy and reality, life and art to create a heartwarming comedy-drama. People tend to perceive Woody as essentially a cynic: In fact, his cynicism is always tempered by a genuine sense of hope; this is keenly felt in one of the director's best nineties films.",4,Woody does it again...,1037232000,"11 14, 2002",2002,1042,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'never', 'made', 'truly', 'bad', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'judged', 'own', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'standard', 'film-making', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'hit-and-miss', 'one', 'sure', 'hit', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'modern', 'myth', 'ingeniously', 'told', 'lens', 'classical', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'fabulous', 'quest', 'beauty', 'Woody', 'father', 'who', 'find', 'mother', 'adopted', 'son', 'belief', 'mother', 'child', 'will', 'represent', 'perfection', 'always', 'Woody', 'world', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'turn', 'out', 'planned.Mira', 'Sorvino', 'charming', 'Woody', 'well', 'WOODY', 'also', 'one', 'Dick', 'Hyman', 'best', 'scores', 'arranged', 'number', 'jazz', 'classics', 'usual', 'ever', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'directors', 'skillfully', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'life', 'art', 'create', 'heartwarming', 'comedy-drama', 'People', 'tend', 'perceive', 'Woody', 'essentially', 'cynic', 'fact', 'cynicism', 'always', 'tempered', 'genuine', 'sense', 'hope', 'keenly', 'felt', 'one', 'director', 'best', 'nineties', 'films']",Mighty Aphrodite VHS
