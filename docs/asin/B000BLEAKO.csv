Diluglio's instruction and workouts are by far the best.You purchase ONE dvd and it features complete information (no ploys to make you buy other dvd's for ""missing"" valuable information or to get you to pay him more money).Upon doing one of his DVD's you'll WANT to buy his others.  I just wish some weren't so expensive (which is why I give 4 stars).Very well made and PROFESSIONALLY PRODUCED (not filmed in his living room with crappy sound quality...those of you that do this should be ashamed of yourselves for the amount of money you charge...at least make SOME effort).I look forward to more from him!!!",4,You won't feel ripped off with this DVD,1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,682,"[""'ve"", 'purchased', 'LOT', 'kettlebell', 'crossfit', 'other', 'workout', 'dvd', 'Diluglio', 'instruction', 'workouts', 'are', 'far', 'best.You', 'purchase', 'ONE', 'dvd', 'complete', 'information', 'ploys', 'make', 'buy', 'other', 'dvd', 'missing', 'valuable', 'information', 'get', 'pay', 'more', 'money', 'doing', 'one', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'WANT', 'buy', 'others', 'just', 'wish', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'expensive', 'why', 'give', '4', 'stars', '.Very', 'well', 'made', 'PROFESSIONALLY', 'PRODUCED', 'not', 'filmed', 'living', 'room', 'crappy', 'sound', 'quality', 'do', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'yourselves', 'amount', 'money', 'charge', 'least', 'make', 'SOME', 'effort', '.I', 'look', 'forward', 'more']",Art of Strength-Providence
944733,A2FMPWCAQSQJ2E,B000BLEAKO,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","I fell in love with AOS Newport which I consider the best ever kbell workout for advanced exercisers. Even though I knew Providence was more basic, I just had to try it. Yes, it's definitely easier, but it's fantastic in its own way. It consists of a huge variety of exercises at an intermediate level. It is by no means boring. The focus is on strength and because it's not complicated you can go as heavy as you can handle making it harder that way. (I'm female and used 15, 20 and 25 lbs). There are short rest periods after each round. I was going to do jumping jacks, but found I needed the recovery. The music is hip-hop oriented where you have the option to play the instrumental version or with vocals. You can even play it without music (you could play your own in the background). I think it fits the workout well though. (Newport has a similar style of music that I like even better). Anthony is super-pleasant and cues perfectly. Both DVDs are very well produced with excellent picture and sound quality, as well as great camera angles to be able to follow it without distraction. Both make me feel lean and strong and just blow me away. They are expensive, but worth every penny.",5,So Good!,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,1192,"['fell', 'love', 'AOS', 'Newport', 'consider', 'best', 'ever', 'kbell', 'workout', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'Even', 'knew', 'Providence', 'was', 'more', 'basic', 'just', 'had', 'try', 'Yes', 'definitely', 'easier', 'fantastic', 'own', 'way', 'huge', 'variety', 'exercises', 'intermediate', 'level', 'means', 'boring', 'focus', 'strength', 'not', 'complicated', 'can', 'go', 'as', 'heavy', 'can', 'handle', 'making', 'harder', 'way', ""'m"", 'female', 'used', '15', '20', '25', 'lbs', 'are', 'short', 'rest', 'periods', 'round', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'found', 'needed', 'recovery', 'music', 'hip-hop', 'oriented', 'where', 'have', 'option', 'play', 'instrumental', 'version', 'vocals', 'can', 'even', 'play', 'music', 'could', 'play', 'own', 'background', 'think', 'workout', 'well', 'Newport', 'similar', 'style', 'music', 'like', 'even', 'better', 'Anthony', 'super-pleasant', 'cues', 'perfectly', 'DVDs', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'excellent', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'camera', 'angles', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'distraction', 'make', 'feel', 'lean', 'strong', 'just', 'blow', 'away', 'are', 'expensive', 'worth', 'penny']",Art of Strength-Providence
944734,A19M9W1SGSIBCV,B000BLEAKO,"BPP ""Lee""","[0, 0]","This is a great DVD to work along with. I would say it is intermediate level, I was in good shape when I got it and I found it challenging as far as my aerobic conditioning. I almost gave out of breath a few times. The music is good, it's well produced, it's easy to follow and it's challenging. It follows a 2 minute exercise circuit with 1 minute of rest for 14 rounds and 1 bonus round. It's one of the best kettlebell DVD's I own but it's not for beginners that are out of shape. For beginners I recomendIron Core KettlebellYou could be new to kettlebells but in pretty good shape and this DVD would be okay for you. I am having to work my way back to being able to to do this workout after a long lay off. But I highly recomend this DVD, if you can't complete the full 2 minute round take extra rest until you build up your endurance. You will not be disapointed with this DVD!",5,My First Kettlebell DVD,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,882,"['great', 'DVD', 'work', 'along', 'would', 'say', 'intermediate', 'level', 'was', 'good', 'shape', 'when', 'got', 'found', 'challenging', 'as', 'far', 'aerobic', 'conditioning', 'almost', 'gave', 'breath', 'few', 'times', 'music', 'good', 'well', 'produced', 'easy', 'follow', 'challenging', '2', 'minute', 'exercise', 'circuit', '1', 'minute', 'rest', '14', 'rounds', '1', 'bonus', 'round', 'one', 'best', 'kettlebell', 'DVD', 'own', 'not', 'beginners', 'are', 'shape', 'beginners', 'recomendIron', 'Core', 'KettlebellYou', 'could', 'be', 'new', 'kettlebells', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'am', 'having', 'work', 'way', 'back', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'workout', 'long', 'lay', 'off', 'highly', 'recomend', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complete', 'full', '2', 'minute', 'round', 'take', 'extra', 'rest', 'build', 'up', 'endurance', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disapointed', 'DVD']",Art of Strength-Providence
944735,A34S3NDIT51DY1,B000BLEAKO,Dee,"[2, 12]","I have quite a few kettlebell DVDs and I was looking for a little something to spice up my workouts. This DVD was not it.There is virtually no instruction provided and let's say the instructor will not win a prize for being personable. A timer is provided and that's probably the best thing I can say for this DVD. If all you are looking for is watch some guy doing a kettlebell routine in an outdoor setting (I not sure, the background does look kind of fake), then this is the workout for you. I could have gotten more from going to my local gym and watching people doing their kettlebell routines. The Iron Core series and the Skogg System are far superior in my opinion. And yes, I am definitely returning this DVD!",2,Almost total lack of instruction,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,719,"['have', 'quite', 'few', 'kettlebell', 'DVDs', 'was', 'looking', 'little', 'something', 'spice', 'up', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'it.There', 'virtually', 'instruction', 'provided', 'let', 'say', 'instructor', 'will', 'not', 'win', 'prize', 'being', 'personable', 'timer', 'provided', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'DVD', 'are', 'looking', 'watch', 'guy', 'doing', 'kettlebell', 'routine', 'outdoor', 'setting', 'not', 'sure', 'background', 'look', 'kind', 'fake', 'then', 'workout', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'going', 'local', 'gym', 'watching', 'people', 'doing', 'kettlebell', 'routines', 'Iron', 'Core', 'series', 'Skogg', 'System', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'opinion', 'yes', 'am', 'definitely', 'returning', 'DVD']",Art of Strength-Providence
944736,A1HTQ1DVVXZS9J,B000BLEAKO,"EC ""E""","[2, 2]","I was hooked after getting his Kettlebell Clinic series.  When I can't get to the gym, I reach for his DVDs.  There's variety in the exercises and they're timed in 2-3 minute rounds. The timer is shown on the screen and you can see where you are in a particular round.  He gives encouragement and you don't feel like you have to get the next DVD to NOT get your money's worth.  At times I've had to stop working out when life gets in the way and I reach for his DVDs to help me get back on track.  I've gone from 10lb KBs to using 25lb KBs.I bought that Jillian Michaels KB DVD and after trying one of the workouts, haven't gone back to it.  If you want a REAL workout, get this series.
