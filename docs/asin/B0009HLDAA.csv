It's sometimes hard to determine which ones to buy in order to stay with the storyline; afterall, you don't want to start in the middle and miss anything. And, some of them do differ. I have 2 copies of the 1st Winx Club and they are a little different from each other.  In one Sky is Sky. In the other, he's pretending to be Brandon and Brandon is pretending to be Sky. This pretense continues through several episodes. This could be confusing for a youngster. But, if you are careful and do manage to buy in order, they are well worth watching over and over again.

905685,A2KPZJBVVUNUT4,B0009HLDAA,S. Beachy,"[14, 19]","I don't understand why anyone has to complain about this DVD here.  This is a place to help people decide whether they want to buy it, not diss it because of how it compares to another.  If you don't like it, don't watch it or buy it.  Winx Club is fascinating and this is coming from a 31 yr. old.  W.I.T.C.H. is also, and does happen to be my favorite of the two but only by a minimal amount.  Each show has positive and negative qualities about them and they are sooo not ""identical"", except for the fact that the girls have magical powers and transform (only changing clothes and hair).  I actually had similar feelings about ""Ghost Whisperer"" being too much like ""Medium"" but boy was I wrong...I love both and they may have a similar foundation but from there, they are different and unique.Back to Winx vs. W.I.T.C.H. - When both shows appeared on American T.V. I was excited to have them to watch and the more shows the better.  I just don't like some of the other cartoons out there and am glad both of these are around.  I love well made cartoons that adults as well as children can relate to or just watch for the pure enjoyment of it.As for Vol. 1 only having 5 episodes, I don't know if it's worth it to buy it for the price.  (This is my reason for the 3 stars rating).  If you just love the show on T.V. and have to have it, then buy it.  Recording the episodes in order can be a royal pain, so buying it may be the best option.  I don't understand why they can't just put out a boxed set of the complete first season as they do with most non-cartoon shows.  If they do that, I'll be sure to buy it, unless of course the seasons only have five episodes each, but I doubt that.",3,????,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,1690,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'complain', 'DVD', 'here', 'place', 'help', 'people', 'decide', 'want', 'buy', 'not', 'diss', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'buy', 'Winx', 'Club', 'fascinating', 'coming', '31', 'yr.', 'old', 'W.I.T.C.H', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'favorite', 'two', 'only', 'minimal', 'amount', 'show', 'positive', 'negative', 'qualities', 'are', 'sooo', 'not', 'identical', 'fact', 'girls', 'have', 'magical', 'powers', 'transform', 'only', 'changing', 'clothes', 'hair', 'actually', 'had', 'similar', 'feelings', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'Medium', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'love', 'may', 'have', 'similar', 'foundation', 'there', 'are', 'different', 'unique.Back', 'Winx', 'vs.', 'W.I.T.C.H', 'When', 'shows', 'appeared', 'American', 'T.V', 'was', 'excited', 'have', 'watch', 'more', 'better', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'cartoons', 'there', 'am', 'glad', 'are', 'love', 'well', 'made', 'cartoons', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'can', 'relate', 'just', 'watch', 'pure', 'enjoyment', 'it.As', 'Vol', '1', 'only', 'having', '5', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'worth', 'buy', 'price', 'reason', '3', 'stars', 'rating', 'just', 'love', 'show', 'T.V', 'have', 'have', 'then', 'buy', 'Recording', 'episodes', 'order', 'can', 'be', 'royal', 'pain', 'buying', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'option', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'put', 'out', 'boxed', 'set', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'do', 'most', 'non-cartoon', 'shows', 'do', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'buy', 'course', 'seasons', 'only', 'have', 'five', 'episodes', 'doubt']",Winx Club Volume 1 - Welcome to Magix!

905689,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B0009HLDAA,Theo,"[1, 1]","There are so many things one could say about Winx Club I'm not quite sure where to begin. It is a show that can be appreciated on a number of levels.First, it works beautifully as a straightforward adventure that even fairly young children should be able to enjoy. On that level alone, it is worth starting out from the very beginning and buying whole seasons. For this program does essentially work as a serial in which the storyline builds progressively from one episode to the next.But far more than that, Winx Club is a show with real depth for those who care to look. Although its tale may be told in shades of Barbie-pink (both literally and figuratively), if you follow this story carefully you will find that it reveals itself as an exceptionally original rendering of a classic myth-form. Just for starters, I'd encourage anyone to compare the first season of Winx Club with the original Star Wars movie. Oh, and if you're drawing a blank on all this ""myth-form"" stuff, now might be a good time to Google ""Joseph Campbell"" or ""the hero's journey"" if you feel yourself so inclined. Keep your eyes open through the later seasons too!Another thing older animation fans might pick up on is that this is one of the very few Western cartoons to really fully digest the anime influence. By contrast with a show like Teen Titans, where the influence of anime is loudly proclaimed but all entirely on the surface, in Winx Club the influence runs not loud, but deep.In Winx Club you will find storylines that are paced out over an entire season, relationships that are allowed to develop on a similar time-frame, and even real sadness that is not automatically resolved by the end of an episode. Plus over and above all this we have a depth of characterization and a complexity of story well beyond what most people would expect from a ""cartoon"". For all this I believe we have anime to thank. In particular, Winx Club is most obviously influenced by the magic girl genre of anime, of which by far the best known example is Sailor Moon. By comparison with its Japanese forebears, Winx Club is clearly more deliberately crafted to be suitable for younger viewers. Nevertheless, real depth and substance remain.If I do have criticisms to make, they are all solely regarding the DVD release. As an unabashed grown-up animation fan, it often seems to me that ""boy"" cartoons far more often wind up receiving a serious, mature DVD release than ""girl"" cartoons such as Winx Club. For example, we can easily buy Justice League and Justice League Unlimited in whole seasons, and when we do buy these shows we also get hours of commentary.But with Winx Club we get no extras at all. None. And to add injury to insult, the company that sells Winx Club on DVD also seems far more inclined to try to maximize revenue by selling us disks containing just four or five episodes apiece. I was seriously tempted to take off a star for stuff like that. However, I'm not going to. I just can't bring myself to do it. This is such a beautiful series with so much to offer both children and adults alike.Winx Club is a show that truly deserves five stars. Even with all the corporate shenanigans.Theo.",5,Surprising Depths,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,3178,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'Winx', 'Club', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'begin', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'number', 'levels.First', 'beautifully', 'straightforward', 'adventure', 'even', 'fairly', 'young', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'level', 'alone', 'worth', 'starting', 'out', 'very', 'beginning', 'buying', 'whole', 'seasons', 'program', 'essentially', 'work', 'serial', 'storyline', 'progressively', 'one', 'episode', 'next.But', 'far', 'more', 'Winx', 'Club', 'show', 'real', 'depth', 'who', 'care', 'look', 'tale', 'may', 'be', 'told', 'shades', 'Barbie-pink', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'follow', 'story', 'carefully', 'will', 'find', 'exceptionally', 'original', 'rendering', 'classic', 'myth-form', 'Just', 'starters', ""'d"", 'encourage', 'anyone', 'compare', 'first', 'season', 'Winx', 'Club', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movie', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'drawing', 'blank', 'myth-form', 'stuff', 'now', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'Google', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'hero', 'journey', 'feel', 'so', 'inclined', 'Keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'later', 'seasons', 'too', 'thing', 'older', 'animation', 'fans', 'might', 'pick', 'up', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'Western', 'cartoons', 'really', 'fully', 'digest', 'anime', 'influence', 'contrast', 'show', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'where', 'influence', 'anime', 'loudly', 'proclaimed', 'entirely', 'surface', 'Winx', 'Club', 'influence', 'not', 'loud', 'Winx', 'Club', 'will', 'find', 'storylines', 'are', 'paced', 'out', 'entire', 'season', 'relationships', 'are', 'allowed', 'develop', 'similar', 'time-frame', 'even', 'real', 'sadness', 'not', 'automatically', 'resolved', 'end', 'episode', 'have', 'depth', 'characterization', 'complexity', 'story', 'well', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'cartoon', 'believe', 'have', 'anime', 'thank', 'particular', 'Winx', 'Club', 'most', 'obviously', 'influenced', 'magic', 'girl', 'genre', 'anime', 'far', 'best', 'known', 'example', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'comparison', 'Japanese', 'forebears', 'Winx', 'Club', 'clearly', 'more', 'deliberately', 'crafted', 'be', 'suitable', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Nevertheless', 'real', 'depth', 'substance', 'remain.If', 'do', 'have', 'criticisms', 'make', 'are', 'solely', 'regarding', 'DVD', 'release', 'unabashed', 'grown-up', 'animation', 'fan', 'often', 'boy', 'cartoons', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'up', 'receiving', 'serious', 'mature', 'DVD', 'release', 'girl', 'cartoons', 'such', 'Winx', 'Club', 'example', 'can', 'easily', 'buy', 'Justice', 'League', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'whole', 'seasons', 'when', 'do', 'buy', 'shows', 'also', 'get', 'hours', 'commentary.But', 'Winx', 'Club', 'get', 'extras', 'None', 'add', 'injury', 'insult', 'company', 'Winx', 'Club', 'DVD', 'also', 'far', 'more', 'inclined', 'try', 'maximize', 'revenue', 'selling', 'disks', 'containing', 'just', 'four', 'five', 'episodes', 'apiece', 'was', 'seriously', 'tempted', 'take', 'off', 'star', 'stuff', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'such', 'beautiful', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'offer', 'children', 'adults', 'alike.Winx', 'Club', 'show', 'truly', 'five', 'stars', 'Even', 'corporate', 'shenanigans.Theo']",Winx Club Volume 1 - Welcome to Magix!
