Season three adds many popular people and maintains the tradition of good writing and acting.Aside from the great acting one thing that makes this program work is that they pick on problems that one could actually face and show how absurd one can get before coming back to earth. There is everything from job loss to weight gain.On this set of DVDs there are some commentaries; the commentaries are not as well thought put as they could have been, however they do add a dimension to the episodes. I hope they still keep going with the series.We did learn that somewhere out there is a pilot of Peter Bonerz whom plays Dr. Jerry Robinson plays a more advances psychologist instead of a dentist.

924471,AWLFVCT9128JV,B000A9QKSM,"Dave_42 ""Dave_42""","[19, 21]","As funny as the first season was, the second season (1973-1974) of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" is even more hilarious.  This show thrived on a great ensemble cast and great writing, and after the first season all the minor hiccups had been worked out.  It is difficult to believe that this show not only never won any Emmy Awards, but was never even nominated for any.Bob's patients play a bigger role this season, and in no episode is that more apparent than the first show of the season called ""Last TV Show"", in which his group talks him into holding one of their sessions on Television.  They are also very funny in ""Mutiny on the Hartley"" when they try to continue without Bob after he raises his rates.  Bob's sister Ellen (Pat Finley) makes her first appearance near the end of the season in ""A Love Story"" where she is engaged to be married until Howard enters her life.There are numerous great episodes this season beyond those I have already mentioned, such as ""Mister Emily Hartley"" where an IQ test shows that Emily's is significantly higher than Bob's, ""T. S. Elliot"" where Mr. Carlin takes Carol out on a Date (Shirley O'Hara's first appearance as Debbie occurs in this episode), and ""By The Way...You're Fired"" where Carol's new romance interferes with her job duties.  As with the first season there are 24 episodes, but in this season they are smoother and more consistently funny.There are many well known guest stars in this season.  Teri Garr plays Miss Brennan, a receptionist.  Mariette Hartley plays Marilyn Dietz who is fought over by Howard and Jerry after Emily sets them both up with her.  Katherine Helmond plays Dr. Webster, a marriage counselor that Bob and Emily go to when their marriage seems to be stuck in a rut.  Ron Glass has a minor role as an Elevator Repairman.  Raul Julia plays Jerry's brother who starts stealing Jerry's patients after Jerry put him through dental school.  Sharon Gless plays Rosalie Shaeffer, one of Howard's girlfriends.  Howard Hesseman plays Craig Plager, one of Bob's patients.  Henry Winkler plays Miles Lascoe, a man on parole for armed robbery who is one of Bob's patients.Unlike the first season set, there are some extras included with this season.  There are five audio commentaries.  All of them include Bob Newhart, one by himself, one with Jack Riley who played Elliot Carlin, and the last three with Marcia Wallace who played Carol and David Davis who helped create the show.  The commentaries are not the best, as there are many extended pauses and some of the stories they tell they repeat on other commentaries, however, I still enjoyed listening to them because there were some interesting stories and information about the show.  There is also a short featurette on the show, with some interviews.  Again I would not say it was the best I have seen, but it has its moments.  Nobody should buy the set because of the extras, but they do add a little something to the total package.",5,Better Than The First Season!,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,2955,"['As', 'funny', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'second', 'season', '1973-1974', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'even', 'more', 'hilarious', 'show', 'thrived', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'great', 'writing', 'first', 'season', 'minor', 'hiccups', 'had', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'difficult', 'believe', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'never', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'nominated', 'any.Bob', 'patients', 'play', 'bigger', 'role', 'season', 'episode', 'more', 'apparent', 'first', 'show', 'season', 'called', 'Last', 'TV', 'Show', 'group', 'holding', 'one', 'sessions', 'Television', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'Mutiny', 'Hartley', 'when', 'try', 'continue', 'Bob', 'rates', 'Bob', 'sister', 'Ellen', 'Pat', 'Finley', 'first', 'appearance', 'end', 'season', 'A', 'Love', 'Story', 'where', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'Howard', 'life.There', 'are', 'numerous', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'such', 'Mister', 'Emily', 'Hartley', 'where', 'IQ', 'test', 'Emily', 'significantly', 'higher', 'Bob', 'T.', 'S.', 'Elliot', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Carlin', 'Carol', 'out', 'Date', 'Shirley', ""O'Hara"", 'first', 'appearance', 'Debbie', 'episode', 'Way', ""'re"", 'Fired', 'where', 'Carol', 'new', 'romance', 'interferes', 'job', 'duties', 'first', 'season', 'are', '24', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'smoother', 'more', 'consistently', 'are', 'many', 'well', 'known', 'guest', 'stars', 'season', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'Miss', 'Brennan', 'receptionist', 'Mariette', 'Hartley', 'Marilyn', 'Dietz', 'who', 'fought', 'Howard', 'Jerry', 'Emily', 'up', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'plays', 'Dr.', 'Webster', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'Bob', 'Emily', 'go', 'when', 'marriage', 'be', 'stuck', 'rut', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'minor', 'role', 'Elevator', 'Repairman', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'Jerry', 'brother', 'who', 'stealing', 'Jerry', 'patients', 'Jerry', 'put', 'dental', 'school', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Rosalie', 'Shaeffer', 'one', 'Howard', 'girlfriends', 'Howard', 'Hesseman', 'Craig', 'Plager', 'one', 'Bob', 'patients', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Miles', 'Lascoe', 'man', 'parole', 'armed', 'robbery', 'who', 'one', 'Bob', 'patients.Unlike', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'are', 'extras', 'included', 'season', 'are', 'five', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'include', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'one', 'one', 'Jack', 'Riley', 'who', 'played', 'Elliot', 'Carlin', 'last', 'three', 'Marcia', 'Wallace', 'who', 'played', 'Carol', 'David', 'Davis', 'who', 'helped', 'create', 'show', 'commentaries', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'are', 'many', 'extended', 'pauses', 'stories', 'tell', 'repeat', 'other', 'commentaries', 'however', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'were', 'interesting', 'stories', 'information', 'show', 'also', 'short', 'featurette', 'show', 'interviews', 'Again', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'moments', 'Nobody', 'should', 'buy', 'set', 'extras', 'do', 'add', 'little', 'something', 'total', 'package']",The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete Second Season

924474,A1KVF4MKAGF67P,B000A9QKSM,Diane L. Mechlinski,"[0, 0]","I have taken it upon myself to watch all the seasons of The Bob Newhart Show - a revisitation for me to a wonderful comedy I enjoyed long ago when it was first run. Back then, I was a young girl who enjoyed the show, too. But today, watching it as an adult, I see it from a different perspective yet still, despite these being different times then when the show was first made, I still find it refreshingly funny, well-acted, and realistic in all aspects.The characters are all genuine, unique and funny in their own ways. They blend well in their story-line lives and I find each one to be absolutely great. Bob in his seriously funny ways - loving, adaptive & supportive Emily, Jerry in his almost believable dental humor and Howard's nearly childlike humorous ways - all amazingly work hand-in-hand to make a family-like group of loving, humorous individuals. Toss in Carol and her office humor and search for dates, Ellen (Howard's sister) is a frequent addition in this season and keeps Howard in good order playing his girlfriend ... not to mention Bob's clients like Mr. Carlin, Michelle, etc., who with their endless problems and good-natured humor make this show a hit today as much as it was back originally.I highly recommend this series for anyone who is nostalgic for some good, honest humor as only comedies from the 70s could be, but also for those who wish to watch a ""laugh-out-loud"" sitcom that has clean, honest, genuinely funny characters. It's truly a great show - whether you're watching it with nostalgia or as a newcomer.",5,All Episodes Excellent and Funny!,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,1545,"['have', 'taken', 'watch', 'seasons', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'revisitation', 'wonderful', 'comedy', 'enjoyed', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'run', 'Back', 'then', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'too', 'today', 'watching', 'adult', 'see', 'different', 'perspective', 'yet', 'still', 'being', 'different', 'times', 'then', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'first', 'made', 'still', 'find', 'refreshingly', 'funny', 'well-acted', 'realistic', 'aspects.The', 'characters', 'are', 'genuine', 'unique', 'funny', 'own', 'ways', 'blend', 'well', 'story-line', 'lives', 'find', 'one', 'be', 'absolutely', 'great', 'Bob', 'seriously', 'funny', 'ways', 'loving', 'adaptive', 'supportive', 'Emily', 'Jerry', 'almost', 'believable', 'dental', 'humor', 'Howard', 'nearly', 'childlike', 'humorous', 'ways', 'amazingly', 'work', 'hand-in-hand', 'make', 'family-like', 'group', 'loving', 'humorous', 'individuals', 'Toss', 'Carol', 'office', 'humor', 'search', 'dates', 'Ellen', 'Howard', 'sister', 'frequent', 'addition', 'season', 'Howard', 'good', 'order', 'playing', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'mention', 'Bob', 'clients', 'Mr.', 'Carlin', 'Michelle', 'etc.', 'who', 'endless', 'problems', 'good-natured', 'humor', 'make', 'show', 'hit', 'today', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'back', 'originally.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'nostalgic', 'good', 'honest', 'humor', 'only', 'comedies', '70s', 'could', 'be', 'also', 'who', 'wish', 'watch', 'laugh-out-loud', 'sitcom', 'clean', 'honest', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'characters', 'truly', 'great', 'show', ""'re"", 'watching', 'nostalgia', 'newcomer']",The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete Second Season

Being born and bred in Chicago, though, there was a great mystery here...In the opening sequence, we see Bob leaving his downtown Chicago office.  We then see him repeatedly going back and forth across the north branch of the Chicago River.  Which leads any reviewer to speculate on the causes for this:1.  Did he find Emily (Suzanne Pleshette) too hard to take, and was debating whether to go home or not?2.  Did Bob have undiagnosed ADHD?3.  Was he looking for the Billy Goat Tavern?The audio commentaries on the DVD, while great, leave these questions unanswered.

Martinez ""Michelle""","[4, 5]","A masterpiece of understated adult humor, epitomized by its low-key star, Bob Newhart, who could get big laughs reading from the phone book with his trademark stammers and pauses.Supporting cast was remarkable, each playing to his or her strengths, gliding smoothly along the tracks laid down by the expert writing staff. Standouts? Everybody was a standout. Peter Bonerz as Jerry, the libidinous orphaned dentist. Bill Daily as the addled Howard Borden, airline navigator, bumbling divorced dad, and meal moocher. Marcia Wallace as Carol, confident, razor-tongued receptionist extraordinaire. Jack Riley as Mr. Carlin, the funniest self-centered jerk of the modern sitcom era. And Suzanne Pleshette as Emily, Bob's gorgeous, sensible wife.The trick to the show's humor was that it seemed to rise naturally from these characters who, though colorful, also resembled real people. Nobody had to push too hard for a laugh.Almost three decades later I still haven't seen another TV comedy series that possessed this one's unique tone of humor, an almost indescribable mix of the usual satire and sarcasm and poking fun at our modern life and lifestyles, balanced perfectly against warm-hearted affirmation of the bonds of friendship and affection that make life bearable.
