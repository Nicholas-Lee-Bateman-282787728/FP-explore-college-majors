The Inhumans struck me as something different and very cool. Their battles and team ups with the FF, Sub Mariner, Spiderman and the Hulk among others as well as the in fighting of the royal family itself was often created some of the best and most dramatic stories of all time. As often happens, I had stopped reading comics by the late 1990's and was lost as to what was happening in the Universe. I discovered the Marvel Knights Inhumans graphic novel while floating around on Amazon about a year ago. I loved everything about it. The art and the complex storyline drew me in immediately.

1618034,APRHZYE8U0IGM,B00AWHDFHQ,"~K.I.S.S.E.S.S~don't lie~ ""An artist's hands ...","[23, 25]","If you are not in any way familiar with motion comics, I am not sure what particular motion comic would be the best introduction for you, but this is not a bad way to begin. Like the writer of this series, Paul Jenkins, I had never heard of The Inhumans, but this really worked to my advantage, to learn of The Inhumans in this way. I think my father-in-law has perhaps mentioned The Inhumans, but his comic collection is so, AWESOME!, that because he has told me so much about Marvel & its history, this title would have been lost in the shuffle. Before I was injured, I was a freelance illustrator, primarily drawing & painting portraits. Until my father-in-law pulled out some of his comics, it had been over 20 years since I had looked at a comic book. I was depressed at how my gift was & is severely affected, yet he kind of brought me full circle with my art and its beginnings, and enjoying the art of others became strangely therapeutic for me, at least emotionally & mentally. I could never marry comic art with the realism of portraiture, so I was unexpectedly re~freshed from this, and it has been juvenescent for me. This is said to help you understand my particular perspective and why you should not be discouraged by what some other reviews have said. To be sure, motion comics ARE NOT traditional animations. These are works that are being created from artwork that was not originally intended for animation, so the look and feel is pausingly unseductive yet attractively unique, peculiar yet fascinating, all at the same time. Iron Man: Extremis was my introduction to motion comics, as I first discovered it on iTunes. It was not until the 3rd episode that I became aware that these were being made from comic books, and that element was intriguing. I immediately purchased the hardcover of Iron Man: Extremis, and I love it. But The Inhumans does not feel like Extremis, does not feel like Thor & Loki: Blood Brothers, does not feel like Spider~Woman: Agent of S.W.O.R.D. But, you clearly recognize that just from the initial and continual movements of the motion comic, they do not possess the fluidity of the morning cartoons, and that is what is so appealing. The decision making to determine how to bring movement from the limbs, the mouth, voices, backgrounds, while preserving and not offending those who know the comics while still capturing a new audience with a different feel of the same comics; that is just astounding and has to be applauded. If you purchase the DVD for Iron Man: Extremis, the artist, Adi Granov, explains how he could never have envisioned how comic book art could be translated into this medium. However, even he was pleasantly surprised that it was crafted particularly well for animation despite the fact that the art originally lacked the purposed foundation & scope for this function. For The Inhumans, I decided to watch the bonus feature first, and it paid off. It provides much background on The Inhumans, and the social implications and how they are tied in make this even more inviting. So much thought is put in to making comics, and depending on what you have been exposed to, in terms of reading and history, comics often repeat or mimic many ideologies, mythologies or theologies, re~packaging them and presenting them in different ways. The Inhumans and motion comics are an extension of these considerations, so with that in mind, give this a try. It is indeed different, but it is not bad.",5,"~This is worth your money, definitely worth your time.~",1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,3457,"['are', 'not', 'way', 'familiar', 'motion', 'comics', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'particular', 'motion', 'comic', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'introduction', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'begin', 'writer', 'series', 'Paul', 'Jenkins', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Inhumans', 'really', 'worked', 'advantage', 'learn', 'Inhumans', 'way', 'think', 'father-in-law', 'perhaps', 'mentioned', 'Inhumans', 'comic', 'collection', 'so', 'AWESOME', 'told', 'so', 'much', 'Marvel', 'history', 'title', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'was', 'injured', 'was', 'freelance', 'illustrator', 'primarily', 'drawing', 'painting', 'portraits', 'father-in-law', 'pulled', 'out', 'comics', 'had', 'been', '20', 'years', 'had', 'looked', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'depressed', 'how', 'gift', 'was', 'severely', 'affected', 'yet', 'kind', 'brought', 'full', 'circle', 'art', 'beginnings', 'enjoying', 'art', 'others', 'became', 'strangely', 'therapeutic', 'least', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'could', 'never', 'marry', 'comic', 'art', 'realism', 'portraiture', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 're~freshed', 'been', 'juvenescent', 'said', 'help', 'understand', 'particular', 'perspective', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'discouraged', 'what', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'be', 'sure', 'motion', 'comics', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'traditional', 'animations', 'are', 'works', 'are', 'being', 'created', 'artwork', 'was', 'not', 'originally', 'intended', 'animation', 'look', 'feel', 'pausingly', 'unseductive', 'yet', 'attractively', 'unique', 'peculiar', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'same', 'time', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Extremis', 'was', 'introduction', 'motion', 'comics', 'first', 'discovered', 'iTunes', 'was', 'not', '3rd', 'episode', 'became', 'aware', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'comic', 'books', 'element', 'was', 'intriguing', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'hardcover', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Extremis', 'love', 'Inhumans', 'not', 'feel', 'Extremis', 'not', 'feel', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'Blood', 'Brothers', 'not', 'feel', 'Spider~Woman', 'Agent', 'S.W.O.R.D', 'clearly', 'recognize', 'just', 'initial', 'continual', 'movements', 'motion', 'comic', 'do', 'not', 'possess', 'fluidity', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'what', 'so', 'appealing', 'decision', 'making', 'determine', 'how', 'bring', 'movement', 'limbs', 'mouth', 'voices', 'backgrounds', 'preserving', 'not', 'offending', 'who', 'know', 'comics', 'still', 'capturing', 'new', 'audience', 'different', 'feel', 'same', 'comics', 'just', 'astounding', 'be', 'applauded', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Extremis', 'artist', 'Adi', 'Granov', 'how', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'envisioned', 'how', 'comic', 'book', 'art', 'could', 'be', 'translated', 'medium', 'However', 'even', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'crafted', 'particularly', 'well', 'animation', 'fact', 'art', 'originally', 'lacked', 'purposed', 'foundation', 'scope', 'function', 'Inhumans', 'decided', 'watch', 'bonus', 'feature', 'first', 'paid', 'off', 'much', 'background', 'Inhumans', 'social', 'implications', 'how', 'are', 'tied', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'inviting', 'So', 'much', 'thought', 'put', 'making', 'comics', 'depending', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'terms', 'reading', 'history', 'comics', 'often', 'repeat', 'mimic', 'many', 'ideologies', 'mythologies', 'theologies', 're~packaging', 'presenting', 'different', 'ways', 'Inhumans', 'motion', 'comics', 'are', 'extension', 'considerations', 'so', 'mind', 'give', 'try', 'indeed', 'different', 'not', 'bad']",Marvel Knights: InHumans

Add to that the stunning visuals of artist Jae Lee and it was a recipe for greatness that I have turned numerous friends onto over the years. I would love to see this team revisit these characters again someday.This &#34;motion comic&#34; captures all of the high points and though a bit clunky (like ALL motion comics) it is forgivable because the artwork is so damned good in it's still form. The voice casting is strong. Not EXACTLY what I heard in my head as a reader, but we all bring our own prejudices to the table with a form of literature that has been adapted from another source.If I have one criticism it would be to not have to go back to the intro and outro title sequences between episodes if trying to watch it as a long form movie.",4,A BRILLIANT Graphic Novel brought to life,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,897,"['When', 'read', 'Marvel', 'Knights', 'Inhumans', 'late', '1990s', 'was', 'absolutely', 'drawn', 'complexity', 'story', 'author', 'Paul', 'Jenkins', 'right', 'away', 'Add', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'artist', 'Jae', 'Lee', 'was', 'recipe', 'greatness', 'have', 'turned', 'numerous', 'friends', 'years', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'team', 'revisit', 'characters', 'again', 'someday.This', '34', 'motion', 'comic', '34', 'captures', 'high', 'points', 'bit', 'clunky', 'motion', 'comics', 'forgivable', 'artwork', 'so', 'damned', 'good', 'still', 'form', 'voice', 'casting', 'strong', 'Not', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'heard', 'head', 'reader', 'bring', 'own', 'prejudices', 'table', 'form', 'literature', 'been', 'adapted', 'source.If', 'have', 'one', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'intro', 'outro', 'title', 'sequences', 'episodes', 'trying', 'watch', 'long', 'form', 'movie']",Marvel Knights: InHumans
