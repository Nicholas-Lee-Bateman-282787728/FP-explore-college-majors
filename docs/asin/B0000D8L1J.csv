But this one had so many problems.1)Mob extortion kick-start plot just seemed lazy and sloppy and out-of-place.  It's hard to laugh when the guy seems to be one step away from getting cacked.2)No chemistry at all between Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson, actors that I otherwise enjoy very much.3)Sub-par plotline.  One of its ""strengths"" is having Kate Hudson dress up and affect different accents (not well, which I guess is the point) about every five minutes.4)Seems outdated.  Who really gets someone to type up their manuscripts anymore?  When the mob smashed up Alex's laptop, why didn't he go to a free one at the library?  A cheap one at an Internet cafe?5)If this an example of Alex's bestselling plot/writing skill, I can't quite understand why the publishing house is not more eager to dump him than harass him into pounding out a new book.6)Ms. Hudson's hard-to-get little miss gets old fast, as does Mr. Wilson's bumbling author.Just. . .not good.

Kat Hudson, a stenographer reluctantly, and I mean, RELUCTANTLY, takes on the job of taking dictation from Luke Wilson so that he has a chance of finishing his latest book in time to get paid and then, in turn, pay off loan sharks who have set their own deadline.  This is the setting for this romantic comedy, or is it romantic tragegy...you decide.Wilson dictates the story which really is quite funny in places.  Hudson dutifully takes the dictation, and then, eventually starts to comment on the story as it goes along.  Of course the two become interested with each other, and just when things are looking like they might sizzle...well, you have to watch the movie.I very much enjoy the switching between the real life events in the movie and the depiction of events that happen as they are being dictated.

While this movie is enjoyable for fans of the romantic comedy genre, it's lukewarm story won't attract anyone who's not expecting the familiar romantic comedy formula (Boy Gets Girl, Boy Loses Girl...)The movie is about a guy named Alex (Wilson) who is a writer struggling to write his second book in thirty days so he can pay off the Cuban mafia for his gambling debt. When they trash his computer, he hires a stenographer named Emma (Hudson) to help him out. The movie has it's moments (I especially enjoyed the one where she drops part of the novel in a puddle and re-writes it herself), but it just doens't have the appeal, wit, or sincerity of other romantic comedies-- like Sleepless in Seattle, or even One Fine Day for that matter.Hudson is the main draw in this movie, and she certainly delivers. She's cute, funny in a not trying to be funny sort of way, and just a great actress, and I'm sorry that this movie wasn't better suited for her talents. Luke Wilson is particulary adorable, though, and I actually felt like I hadn't seen this side of Wilson before in a movie, which I really enjoyed.I didn't like the fact that this movie went between two stories that were practically the same. Alex's book is acted out throughout the movie, and of course his book is a mirror image of what is going on in his real life, except that it's set on a fake island many many years ago. It was unnecessary to have two like stories-- Rob Reiner should've picked one and went with it.I'm a huge fan of romantic comedies, but this one just didn't strike me like others have.

777028,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,B0000D8L1J,Classic Movie watcher,"[2, 2]","Between the money-thirsty but dazzling Polina (Sophie Marceau) and the pleasant, down-to-earth Anna (Kate Hudson), what should a penniless Adam (Luke Wilson) do? This was the plot about which Alex (Luke Wilson) the author wrote a book in 30 days. His stenographer Emma (Kate Hudson), who liked a book only if the ending pleased her, often protested and steered Alex's story in the right direction.As the plot of the book materialised, Emma's affection for Alex grew just as Adam's relationship with Anna blossomed in the book. But then Emma gradually suspected that Alex drew on his own experiences in writing and dreaded the threat of Polina, Alex's dream lover, in real life. Moreover, would the book's fruitless ending of the love triangle bear any reflection on Alex's attitude of shunning intimate relationships?A simple plot this was. All three characters got to play dual characters - in the book and in real life. But Rob Reiner, the director(When Harry met Sally) juggled tactfully between the book's characters and Alex-Emma dialogue, making the development crisp and sharp. He also played a substantial part in the movie. Kate Hudson played superbly as a die-hard romantic - lovable, opined, decisive and non-compromising. The surprise was the dazzling beauty of Sophie Marceau, both in the book's character and as Alex's ex-lover who showed up in the end for a possible reunion. But what held this movie together was the carefully crafted words of the book, sweetened by Luke Wilson's clear and enlightening voice. Surely, the ending was predictable; yet witnessing the birth of a book, from beginning to end, with a rewritten ending somehow injected dynamicism and creative process in the movie. Not a romantic comedy of actions, big emotional ups and downs. Rather it is for those who appreciate romance in subtlety.

I rented this DVD during a rather tedious reading rut and enjoyed it very much. It isn't the best film I've seen by a long shot, but I loved the story of a blocked writer (Luke Wilson) dictating his novel to a sarcastic stenographer (Kate Hudson) after two Cuban loan sharks threaten to kill him if he doesn't pay back $100,000. I didn't like the whole loan shark thing, but the rest of the story is cute. Alex tells the story of a lovesick writer doing whatever is possible to woo a beautiful French woman. Is it all taken from his imagination or from real life? I liked Hudson's portrayal of Emma. Her character's dry humor made me laugh at times. Wilson also does a nice job playing the neurotic Alex. Even though most writers wouldn't let anyone interfere with their writing in real life, it is interesting to see what difference it would make if a regular reader would give an honest take on your work in progress. But, as said earlier, I cannot imagine a writer allowing that to happen, for writers are very sensitive about their work. I also liked that the movie is set in Boston. Anyway, Alex and Emma isn't a major film extravaganza, but it is a wonderful, cute film nevertheless. The DVD itself isn't so special either. It has no extra features to make it memorable.

You get ""Alex and Emma"" the new movie from director Rob Reiner. I liked this movie, not only because of the acting, but because of the story. In this movie, you don't just get one story, but you get two. Each story has the characters facing problems, but the two stories are also very much the same. I was one of the only people that I know that liked this movie. Every critic trashed it, and it bombed at the box office, which is a surprise because Kate Hudson's movie a few months before, ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days,"" was a box office hit. But I liked it, and I'll tell you why.Let's start with the stories of ""Alex and Emma."" The first story is about Alex Sheldon who is a broke author with a large problem. He owes $100,000 to a couple of Cubans in the mafia because of a gambling debt. The way to get the money is to deliever the copy of his next book to his publisher Wirschafter. His other problem is that he has a strong sickness of writer's block. After the Cubans set his laptop computer on fire, Alex hired Emma, a stenographer, to type up the book as he recites it to her. She decides to help, even after finding out that if he does not have the book finished in thirty days, the Cubans will kill him. As Alex writes the book, Emma has to throw in her comments along the way, and something happens to them that they would least expect... they fall in love. I'm not ruining anything by telling you that, it's common knowledge.Alex's book is pretty similiar to real life, a factor that writer's like to include in their books. It is about a man named Adam who has come to tutor the children of Polina, a lovely French women who Adam falls madly in love with. The only problem there is that she is poor, and is waiting for her old grandmother to die and leave her the money. Otherwise she will have to marry her suitor John Shaw. Adam tries to find ways to get together with Polina and also becomes attracted to the worker for Polina who changes from Ylva to Elsa to Eldora and finally to Anna. Those four characters are all played by Kate Hudson. The story within a story is clever, and I liked how you could tell what is similar to real life and what isn't, untill you find out EXACTLY what is similar to real life and what isn't. I liked this movie because it had alot of dialouge, and alot of witty lines that are thrown out there. It was a good movie that I recommend to all.

If he writes his second novel in 30 days his publisher will pay him allowing him to pay off loan sharks. He hires a stenographer to write while he dictates his novel.MY FEEDBACK:I thought this was an underrated movie.The humor in the Italian Job (an action flick?!?) was actually better and had more of it, but the parts that were meant to be humorous were funny. Some of the humor people won't catch unless they are listening and looking closely...nice subtle details inlaid within the movie.This was more of a drama than a comedy which I can see some people not liking it as much since expectations won't be met.The feelings that develop between the two characters seemed a lot more belieable than any other romantic comedy I can think of over the last year or two.For those that are writers, they will get an extra enjoyment out of the movie that many viewers might miss or not appreciate.OVERALL:It was a very well written flick with sproadic bits of humor and a lot more commentary on people who are challenged in relationships.

On top of that, he owes loan sharks some money, a lot of money. To turn his life around, he has to finish a novel in 30 days (or else...), so he hires a stenographer named Emma (Kate Hudson). Alex has a fine storyline, but this doesn't stop opinionated Emma from challenging his ideas. His fictional story of love seems to mirror things from reality. While the story tries to work itself out, Alex and Emma spend days (and nights) working to finish the book. Soon, we find that the characters in his novel aren't the only ones falling in love...Kate Hudson is fantastic in the film. She gracefully takes on five separate roles throughout the film (Ylva, Elsa, Eldora, Anna, and Emma), which really impressive. Luke Wilson is also likeable and amusing. The creative script continues to grasp while Rob Reiner's direction makes this film a ""When Harry Met Sally..."" for the 21st century. ""Alex & Emma"" has romance and comedy, making it enjoyable with its fun comparisons and interesting artistic views. Reiner brings us a great romantic comedy that holds the audience and proves to be not only likeable, but also respectable.

""When Harry Met Sally..."" is, by all definitions, a classic.  ""The American President"" while somewhat formulaic adds a political edge thanks to writer Aaron Sorokin that makes it rise above the others.  ""Alex & Emma"", however, doesn't even get to first base and is a lifeless imitator following in the shadows of these two other films.Alex, played by Luke Owen, is an author suffering from writer's block.  If he doesn't break through it and finish his novel in a month and get some badly needed money some unsavory Cuban mobsters intend to feed him to the fishes.  Enter Emma, played by Kate Hudson, as the stenographer he hires to help him get through the book.  She is the ""shoot-from-the-lip"" kind of gal who doesn't have a problem questioning some of Alex's story logic as he blindly feels his way through his novel.  As the novel progresses, there is a sort of ""movie within a movie"" as Alex, Emma, and (unbeknownst to Emma at the time) his ex-girlfriend, Polina (portrayed by Sophie Marceau) play out his story that's set in the early years of the 20th century.""Alex & Emma"" proceeds predictably: boy and girl clash, boy and girl sleep together, boy and ex-girl get together for brief moment, girl tells boy to get lost, yadda yadda yadda.  You don't need to even watch the movie to know what's going to happen next.  It's as if the writer simply took a ""How to Write a RomCom for Dummies"" book and followed a tired format used by just about everybody else.  Rob Reiner's direction is bland and uninspiring.  The worst part, however, is Luke Owen.  In my opinion he is the worst actor of the current generation, an opinion that I verified when I stumbled upon another outing of his on cable, ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend.""  There is no variety or emotion in any of his work.  He could very well be doing one of his cell phone commercials and you would never know the difference.If you like predictable romcoms that follow the basic framework, then go get this one.

I liked the low-key tempo, I liked the easy familiarity of both the actors and their characters, and I liked how their relationship in real life was reflected by the characters in the book. I especially liked that both actors, and their characters were so likable that it was like sitting down for an hour-and-a-half with some old friends and just relaxing.This was never meant to be An Officer and a Gentleman or Casablanca. This wasn't a story about histrionics and/or sparks flying. This was meant to be, and is, a story about two people with flaws, who find them to be complimentary. You can see it in the way they immediately fall into an old relationship pattern of taking shots at one another, criticising each other, but not taking it too seriously, rather passing it off as just them being them. You also see it in the way they continue to write or talk to each other as they use the toilet, eat, etc.The changing relationship can be most clearly seen (from Alex's viewpoint) in the changing of the characters Kate Hudson plays in the book - from the (pain in the a**) au pair Ylva, to the interested confidant Elsa (both deliberately overacted by Kate to indicate Alex's current vision of her), to the absolutely adorable Anna, the love interest. And, of course Emma is very defensive of these characters throughout, thereby revealing her feelings about Adam/Alex. This is validated in the final scene as Alex/Emma interchange with Adam/Anna, personally and in time.Not every movie has to leave you breathless, crying, hyped - whatever.

The director of such splendid fare as A Few Good Men, The American President, When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride, and This is Spinal Tap appears to have lost his touch--he hasn't made a good film since 1995.But I blame Jeremy Leven, best known for the dud The Legend of Bagger Vance, for writing this movie in the first place. Who could have possibly thought that a movie about writing a book under threat of death due to gambling debts--and falling in love with your mouthy stenographer--would make for an entertaining movie? (OK, so maybe the premise doesn't sound that bad. The execution is.)Lines are delivered without any conviction. The mildly humorous convention of changing the appearance of the book's characters to reflect how Wilson is rewriting it works once, maybe twice, but begins to grate by the third try.

777058,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000D8L1J,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","I absolutely love Kate Hudson and always enjoy seeing Luke Wilson, so I really couldn't imagine that this wouldn't be at least a decent film, but somehow or other the filmmakers managed to create a bit of a lemon.  The film even had the extraordinarily beautiful Sophie Marceau.  Nonetheless, I was bored to tears by the halfway point, and I found that in the end I didn't even much care whether the protagonists got together or not.There are a huge number of really big problems with this film.  For one, take the premise.  A writer needs to produce a manuscript of his next novel in order to receive a $125,000 advance.  I have worked in publishing, and have a friend who writes far more successful than the fictional novelist in this film, and the idea of a writer with only one novel behind him receiving a $125,000 advance is simply preposterous.  So, the movie lost me from the get-go.Much of the film is told via a gimmick, a gimmick that unfortunately doesn't work.  Luke Wilson plays a novelist who hires stenographer Kate Hudson to help him produce a novel in less than a month so that some criminals to whom he owes a great deal of money won't do exceedingly nasty things to him.  As he dictates, the film narrative becomes that of the book, and in these scenes the hero's (played by Luke Wilson) love interest is played by Sophie Marceau and a secondary female character is played by Kate Hudson.  Of course, during the course of the movie/novel, Hudson gradually supplants Marceau in Wilson's affections.  Predictably, towards the end of the film, the novelist's old flame shows up, who is also played by Marceau.  He is forced to choose between his old girlfriend and his new love interest.  This shifting back and forth is not handled well, and part of the problem is that the story within the story is abominably uninteresting.  The scenes between the novelist and the stenographer are far better, but there is no tension in their relationship except what is lent to it from the novel's story.  Ironically, the stronger part is logically propped up by the weaker part.Another problem with the movie is that Hudson simply isn't used very well.  Her part is horribly written, with her at several points in the novelistic half of the film playing various kinds of foreign servants, whether Russian or Spanish.  Kate Hudson's greatest strength is her face, which is a magnificent vehicle for expressing emotion and joy.

When he's cooking on all burners - as with ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""The American President"" - he's been able to create some of the most compleat and satisfying romantic comedies of recent years.  Yet, when the muses have eluded him - as with ""North,"" ""The Sum of Us"" and the appalling ""Alex and Emma"" - Reiner has produced some truly classic stinkers, films so misguided and infamously bad as to make us wonder whether this could indeed be the same man responsible for all these different films.""Alex and Emma"" steals its premise pretty much intact from ""Paris When it Sizzles,"" that notorious 1964 misfire that probably established a career low for both Audrey Hepburn and William Holden, two of the most likable and attractive performers of their time.  In ""Alex and Emma,"" Luke Wilson portrays a successful fiction writer in hock to some Cuban gamblers who are threatening to kill him if he doesn't pay them from the proceeds from his new - as yet unwritten - novel.  After the thugs burn his computer, Alex hires a stenographer, played by Kate Hudson, to help him complete the new tome in time.  The two, of course, despise each other at first, but as Alex dictates his novel to her, with Emma providing pointed criticism and helping him shape the final product, true love begins to bloom.As with the recent ""Big Fish,"" the story here runs along parallel tracks, as Wilson and Hudson act out scenes from the work Alex is writing - a cheap dime-store novel set in the scenic 1920's.  The book is so preposterously corny, melodramatic and clich&eacute;d that we can scarce believe anyone would write such a work, let alone publish it, though we are led to believe that all sorts of people who would know better in real life stand in great awe of both the book and Alex's talents as a writer.  The scenes set in the fictional world he's created, though very pretty to look at, are excruciatingly arch, coy and cloying, poorly acted and even more poorly written.  Wilson and Hudson do little but play dress-up in these scenes, set completely adrift by a humorless script and directionless direction.  The scenes set in ""real"" time are scarcely more palatable, although the actors are at least able to relax a bit and let more of their likeability shine through.""Alex and Emma,"" though billed as a romantic comedy, has a true tin ear when it comes to both romance and comedy.

777066,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000D8L1J,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","&quot;Alex &amp; Emma&quot; is actually a remake of the 1997 UK-Hungarian film 'The Gambler' starring Michael Gambon and Johdi May.  And the original is about the Russian writer Dostoevskey, and what happened to him while writing the novella of that title.  You should keep this in mind, because &quot;A &amp; E&quot; suffers from the wrong-headed judgment of modernizing the setting of the original which was deep in the 19th century.The story of this romantic comedy is, simply put, &quot;When Alex meets Emma (or vice virsa)&quot; directed by Rob Reiner, who knows a few things about this genre.  Alex  (Luke Wilson) is a writer stumbled on the writer's block, and in debt.  He must make money in 30 days, and to do so, he hires a stenographer Emma (Kate Hudson), and attempts to finish writing a novel.The novel develops, thanks to the unexpected inspiration from Emma.  It is about Adam, a tutor living in the 1920s, who falls in love with a French lady Polina (Sophie Marceau).  From then on, we see two stories one after the other, both influencing each other.NOW, the good thing about &quot;A &amp; E&quot; is that Kate Hudson (who plays five roles in this film) is delightful to see.  Luke Wilson is also good and likable, and they make a couple of man and woman who must fall in love with each other.  And we know it, and welcome it.BUT the problem is, as I said before, the setting.  In the original &quot;Gambler&quot;, Dostoevskey had to submit his rights for publishing his novels to the greedy publisher, not his life as depicted here.  No one believes in the central story of &quot;Alex &amp; Emma&quot; when it talks about the 30 days limit and being killed.  Think about it.  Some mobsters are after you, and they want the money back.  However, they burn (yes, literally burn) your lap-top PC, which only prevents your scheme of returning money.That's a too obvious and tactless device on the filmmaker's side to have Alex hire Emma.  And in the original, the stenographer has no other place to go except the writer (it was the 19th century, and women's jobs were quite limited).  In &quot;Alex and Emma,&quot; though Emma needs money (she comes by bus, see?), and she knows Alex is broke because of gambling, she still decides to work for him as long as 30 days without being even paid in advance!  And to make matters worse, what Alex writes is not funny at all, but still we are to believe this &quot;story within story&quot; is to be a hit to pay back all the debt.  Sorry, but I can't believe it.&quot;Alex &amp; Emma&quot; is engaging only when it forgets its plot, which is a poor excuse for bringing the leads together.  And Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson do their jobs quite nicely.  Pity that the characters are empty, and the story unbelievable.  &quot;When Harry met Sally ...&quot; are about real people.

I disliked this film so much that I feel compelled to warn people to not see it and waste an hour and a half of their lives they will never get back. The best romantic comedies (Notting Hill, WHMS, SIS, Moonstruck, Amelie, etc.) all have characters we love and care about, clever & honest dialogue and also are truthful about relationships and are really funny. Jeremy Leven's script has got to be one of the most shallow, by-the-numbers romantic comedies ever written. Just sloppy, unfunny writing. Reiner's direction wants to be about the pains of writing and the muse-creator love, but it all is shallow, Hollywood studio back-lot garbage. Kate Hudson, who is truly a good actress, either needs a new agent or be more picky when it comes to picking projects (""How to Lose a Guy..."", another bad movie, at least had SOME laughs). Reiner hasn't made a good picture since ""The American President"" in 1995. Can you imagine this is thet same guy who made ""Stand by Me"", ""The Princess Bride"", ""A Few Good Men"", etc. Reiner actually was a good director once. In fact, this movie is so derivitive & unoriginal that one scene even steals an idea directly from ""Whem Harry Met Sally""! In conclusion, AVOID THIS FILM LIKE THE PLAGUE. There actually is a funny, charming, realistic romantic comedy out there right now you may have heard of called ""Bend it like Beckham"" that actually is funny & well-made. Along with ""From Justin to Kelly"", this is (so far) the worst film of 2003.",1,Can I please get 96 minutes of my life back?,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,1718,"['Alex', 'Emma', 'latest', 'failure', 'oeuvere', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'career', 'so', 'lacking', 'light', 'charming', 'characters', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'romance', 'movie', 'tedious', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'even', 'only', '96', 'minutes', 'disliked', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'feel', 'compelled', 'warn', 'people', 'not', 'see', 'waste', 'hour', 'half', 'lives', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'WHMS', 'SIS', 'Moonstruck', 'Amelie', 'etc', 'have', 'characters', 'love', 'care', 'clever', 'honest', 'dialogue', 'also', 'are', 'truthful', 'relationships', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'Jeremy', 'Leven', 'script', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'shallow', 'by-the-numbers', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'ever', 'written', 'Just', 'sloppy', 'unfunny', 'writing', 'Reiner', 'direction', 'be', 'pains', 'writing', 'muse-creator', 'love', 'shallow', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'back-lot', 'garbage', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'truly', 'good', 'actress', 'either', 'new', 'agent', 'be', 'more', 'picky', 'when', 'picking', 'projects', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', 'bad', 'movie', 'least', 'had', 'SOME', 'laughs', 'Reiner', ""n't"", 'made', 'good', 'picture', 'American', 'President', '1995', 'Can', 'imagine', 'thet', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'etc', 'Reiner', 'actually', 'was', 'good', 'director', 'once', 'fact', 'movie', 'so', 'derivitive', 'unoriginal', 'one', 'scene', 'even', 'idea', 'directly', 'Whem', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'conclusion', 'AVOID', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'LIKE', 'THE', 'PLAGUE', 'actually', 'funny', 'charming', 'realistic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'called', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'actually', 'funny', 'well-made', 'Justin', 'Kelly', 'so', 'far', 'worst', 'film', '2003']",N/A
