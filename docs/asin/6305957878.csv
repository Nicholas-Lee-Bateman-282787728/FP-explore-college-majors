484545,A3UEK1302ECDAB,6305957878,"James Helberg ""Actor for Hire""","[44, 44]","I was disapointed with this DVD collection! Included are 3 clip collection segments, ""Funniest Moments Vol. 1 & 2"", ""The Wit & Wisdom Of Ed Norton"", and the full length episode ""Letter To The Boss"" Now, as a fan of the show,these characters, and actors who portray them I was entertained viewing this DVD. However, this does not represent the very best of the Honeymooners as the title states! A major part of the Funniest Moments bits include bloopers which in most cases they are not at their very best! I would suggest that anyone who is viewing ""The Honeymooners"" for the first time watch the ""Original 39"" episodes which are available on another collection.

484550,A3ACRPV8IRCW3,6305957878,Secretariatgal,"[6, 7]","This was back in the classic age of television. This television show, the honeymooners, is a clear example of the genious Gleason had for putting on a show. Back then, television had class. They were very basic story lines but back then they didn't need an elaborate script to cover up bad acting like they do now. Sure, they can call the actors nowadays stars, but the stars of the honeymooners were REAL stars. The brilliancy and capability of mind to ad lib whenever something didn't go as planned still amazes me to think that they could do something as hard as that spur of the moment. To cover up a mistake when you know one without breaking a smile is super acting. The hilarious episodes portrayed in this DVD only points out the case more that they don't make television like they used to. The Honeymooners are always fun to pull out and you'll always laugh; even if you had seen it a hundred times. That there points out that no show will ever be able to come close to the genious of Jackie Gleason and the charm of '50's television.",5,Shows That Didn't Have To Be Crude To Make You Laugh!,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,1043,"['was', 'back', 'classic', 'age', 'television', 'television', 'show', 'honeymooners', 'clear', 'example', 'genious', 'Gleason', 'had', 'putting', 'show', 'Back', 'then', 'television', 'had', 'class', 'were', 'very', 'basic', 'story', 'lines', 'back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'elaborate', 'script', 'cover', 'up', 'bad', 'acting', 'do', 'now', 'Sure', 'can', 'call', 'actors', 'nowadays', 'stars', 'stars', 'honeymooners', 'were', 'REAL', 'stars', 'brilliancy', 'capability', 'mind', 'ad', 'lib', 'whenever', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'still', 'think', 'could', 'do', 'something', 'as', 'hard', 'spur', 'moment', 'cover', 'up', 'mistake', 'when', 'know', 'one', 'breaking', 'smile', 'super', 'acting', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'portrayed', 'DVD', 'only', 'out', 'case', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'television', 'used', 'Honeymooners', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'pull', 'out', ""'ll"", 'always', 'laugh', 'even', 'had', 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'points', 'out', 'show', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'come', 'close', 'genious', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'charm', ""'50"", 'television']",The Very Best of the Honeymooners
