1539819,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B007Y6CSGC,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[6, 7]","Note: I saw this in the theater on the big IMAX screen, so I didn't get the chance to see the extras on the DVD.This is a wonderful movie with a message, but I'll warn anyone coming into this: this film is very focused on global warming. It's an important message, but I felt that at times this film didn't entirely know what to focus on: the polar bears or the threat to their environment. As a result we don't really have a good look at either. To the Artic is only 40 minutes in length, so this leaves it with a bit of a handicap.The movie is gorgeous to watch, so even with the film feeling a bit muddled in its focus you still have tons of gorgeous scenery to watch. The film work is really amazing here, with tons of close ups of adorable polar bear behavior and breathtaking shots of the glistening ice. There are also some shots of how the scenes are shot, both human and remote cameras. I think this was one of the more interesting aspects of the movie because at times it shows how dangerous it can be for the equipment and the persons going underwater.I think that this was toned down a lot for younger audiences and the short length, but at times I kind of feel that they could have done more with this. I remember watching far more intense films when I was younger on PBS and not getting too scared, so I really wish that they'd gone a bit more in depth either way. I do like that this film mentioned how we impact the environment, but I wish that they'd elaborated just a little. Maybe giving some suggestions on how to help or something along those lines?Overall though this is still very much worth the price of admission to your local theater and worth renting. This does have value as far as viewing it again, as there's nothing truly gory or scary for your younger viewers. They'll love watching the adorable polar bear babies and even if it's a little light, you'll like that it's educational.For the older viewers, this will be something they'll really only watch a few times so you'd probably be better off getting one of the more full length documentaries on the Artic. This is nice, but a little light for the ones wanting a bit more meat to their viewing experience.",4,"Amazing, but one or two reservations...",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2191,"['Note', 'saw', 'theater', 'big', 'IMAX', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'extras', 'DVD.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'message', ""'ll"", 'warn', 'anyone', 'coming', 'film', 'very', 'focused', 'global', 'warming', 'important', 'message', 'felt', 'times', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'know', 'what', 'focus', 'polar', 'bears', 'threat', 'environment', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'good', 'look', 'Artic', 'only', '40', 'minutes', 'length', 'bit', 'handicap.The', 'movie', 'gorgeous', 'watch', 'so', 'even', 'film', 'feeling', 'bit', 'muddled', 'focus', 'still', 'have', 'tons', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'watch', 'film', 'work', 'really', 'amazing', 'here', 'tons', 'close', 'ups', 'adorable', 'polar', 'bear', 'behavior', 'breathtaking', 'shots', 'glistening', 'ice', 'are', 'also', 'shots', 'how', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'human', 'remote', 'cameras', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'movie', 'times', 'how', 'dangerous', 'can', 'be', 'equipment', 'persons', 'going', 'underwater.I', 'think', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'lot', 'younger', 'audiences', 'short', 'length', 'times', 'kind', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'remember', 'watching', 'far', 'more', 'intense', 'films', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'PBS', 'not', 'getting', 'too', 'scared', 'really', 'wish', ""'d"", 'gone', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'way', 'do', 'film', 'mentioned', 'how', 'impact', 'environment', 'wish', ""'d"", 'elaborated', 'just', 'little', 'Maybe', 'giving', 'suggestions', 'how', 'help', 'something', 'lines', 'Overall', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'price', 'admission', 'local', 'theater', 'worth', 'renting', 'have', 'value', 'as', 'far', 'viewing', 'again', 'nothing', 'truly', 'gory', 'scary', 'younger', 'viewers', ""'ll"", 'love', 'watching', 'adorable', 'polar', 'bear', 'babies', 'even', 'little', 'light', ""'ll"", 'like', 'older', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'something', ""'ll"", 'really', 'only', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'so', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'getting', 'one', 'more', 'full', 'length', 'documentaries', 'Artic', 'nice', 'little', 'light', 'ones', 'wanting', 'bit', 'more', 'meat', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A
1539820,A1H57S6ZRGQG84,B007Y6CSGC,"Elder Dave ""adman62""","[0, 0]","This is a beautifully shot film in full blu-ray 3-D, although some parts seem 2-D because white on white doesn't make for a strong enough contrast --just as would be the case if we were actually there. However, the shots of the bears, the caribou, the walruses and the men, dogs and sled are clearly 3-D. The cinematography never fails to amaze. Best just to quiet the mind and open oneself to the overpowering beauty and awesomeness of the scenery. This is a place I'll probably never go, but the 3-D took me there. As some ad says, ""You're either watching a film, or you're part of it."" I felt part of this.Sure, the film strongly addresses the deterioration of the ice caps and glaciers. Doesn't matter what you think is causing this slow-moving catastrophe. Any sane person will agree we should do whatever we can to slow it down. There's a good chance our children's children (if they haven't left the planet) will be struggling to survive if we are inattentive to this people-destroying event. The polar bears and birds are only among the first to show the effects.What can a person say? Either we understand that we are helping to slowly choke off Mother Earth's ability to nurture us, or we'd rather be either a politician trying to hold on to power or one of his/her devotees. Nearly all the world's most prominent and well-respected scientists (about 98% at last international count) call this a no-brainer. There is nothing political ultimately about being choked into extinction. Death is death both to Democrats and Republicans.Meanwhile, Meryl Streep's narration is outstanding, and the Beatles' songs used (of which another reviewer said, ""Ick""!!!!) are wonderful to hear in clear 5.1 sound. Even if you hate thinking about ""climate change"", I would buy this,turn off the sound, put on your favorite music, and become immersed in the amazing visual experience this film affords--particularly in 3-D.",5,A Chilling Film,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1914,"['beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'full', 'blu-ray', '3-D', 'parts', 'seem', '2-D', 'white', 'white', ""n't"", 'make', 'strong', 'enough', 'contrast', 'just', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'were', 'actually', 'there', 'However', 'shots', 'bears', 'caribou', 'walruses', 'men', 'dogs', 'sled', 'are', 'clearly', '3-D', 'cinematography', 'never', 'amaze', 'Best', 'just', 'quiet', 'mind', 'open', 'overpowering', 'beauty', 'awesomeness', 'scenery', 'place', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'go', '3-D', 'took', 'there', 'ad', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', ""'re"", 'part', 'felt', 'part', 'this.Sure', 'film', 'strongly', 'deterioration', 'ice', 'caps', 'glaciers', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'causing', 'slow-moving', 'catastrophe', 'Any', 'sane', 'person', 'will', 'agree', 'should', 'do', 'can', 'slow', 'down', 'good', 'chance', 'children', 'children', 'have', ""n't"", 'left', 'planet', 'will', 'be', 'struggling', 'survive', 'are', 'inattentive', 'people-destroying', 'event', 'polar', 'bears', 'birds', 'are', 'only', 'first', 'show', 'effects.What', 'can', 'person', 'say', 'understand', 'are', 'helping', 'slowly', 'choke', 'off', 'Mother', 'Earth', 'ability', 'nurture', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'politician', 'trying', 'hold', 'power', 'one', 'his/her', 'devotees', 'Nearly', 'world', 'most', 'prominent', 'well-respected', 'scientists', '98', '%', 'last', 'international', 'count', 'call', 'no-brainer', 'nothing', 'political', 'ultimately', 'being', 'choked', 'extinction', 'Death', 'death', 'Democrats', 'Republicans.Meanwhile', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'narration', 'outstanding', 'Beatles', 'songs', 'used', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Ick', 'are', 'wonderful', 'hear', 'clear', '5.1', 'sound', 'Even', 'hate', 'thinking', 'climate', 'change', 'would', 'buy', 'turn', 'off', 'sound', 'put', 'favorite', 'music', 'become', 'immersed', 'amazing', 'visual', 'experience', 'film', 'affords', 'particularly', '3-D']",N/A
