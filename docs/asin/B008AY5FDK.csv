She always says that every dancer has there own strength and teaching is her's. Although I don't care much for her dance style when she isn't teaching. I wouldn't say this DVD is &#34;a Piece of Cake&#34; but it is fun.The pros:Neon talks you through the moves and gives good technique reminders throughout. I personally love this because i'm not always sure what to do with my head or my hands. I'm not usually into a one teacher experience if there are three people pictured, but this time it seemed okay. I really enjoyed the music the mix of fast and slow was a good change of pace. I didn't mind the black background actually. Neon is always wearing pink and since she's the only &#34;teacher&#34; I didn't pay much attention to the other two, so seeing them or not wasn't a big deal to me. Pink wearing Neon is always easy to see.The Cons:Ouch, my legs and arms hurt after doing the workout, this may change as I get more used to the workout and the dance experience. Right now though it hurts to hold my arms in neutral position for as long as I have to and occasionally I just have to move them even when she isn't. I walk up and down stairs a lot so all the lunges etc hurt my legs after awhile. Again this may change as I get more used to the workout.I really missed the practice flow section she has on both Hard Candy and Love Potion, I felt like simply jumping into the workout was detrimental to me. I'm still not sure how to do a few moves and I've been working with the DVD for a bit now. The Tutorial was a bit too short and didn't cover everything, that I could see I haven't watched all of it, but I was looking for the cross steps and a few other moves and couldn't find them.Overall the music and the moves are all here it gives a great dance experience even if you are already taking classes. If you are looking for a &#34;teacher&#34; give her a shot she is very good.",4,Ow,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,2007,"['always', 'Neon', 'great', 'dance', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'find', 'teacher', 'as', 'good', 'always', 'dancer', 'there', 'own', 'strength', 'teaching', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'dance', 'style', 'when', ""n't"", 'teaching', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'DVD', '34', 'Piece', 'Cake', '34', 'fun.The', 'pros', 'Neon', 'talks', 'moves', 'good', 'technique', 'reminders', 'personally', 'love', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'always', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'head', 'hands', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'one', 'teacher', 'experience', 'are', 'three', 'people', 'pictured', 'time', 'seemed', 'okay', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'mix', 'fast', 'slow', 'was', 'good', 'change', 'pace', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'black', 'background', 'actually', 'Neon', 'always', 'wearing', 'pink', 'only', '34', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'other', 'two', 'seeing', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'Pink', 'wearing', 'Neon', 'always', 'easy', 'see.The', 'Cons', 'Ouch', 'legs', 'arms', 'hurt', 'doing', 'workout', 'may', 'change', 'get', 'more', 'used', 'workout', 'dance', 'experience', 'Right', 'now', 'hold', 'arms', 'neutral', 'position', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'occasionally', 'just', 'have', 'move', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'walk', 'up', 'down', 'stairs', 'lot', 'lunges', 'etc', 'hurt', 'legs', 'awhile', 'Again', 'may', 'change', 'get', 'more', 'used', 'workout.I', 'really', 'missed', 'practice', 'flow', 'section', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'Love', 'Potion', 'felt', 'simply', 'jumping', 'workout', 'was', 'detrimental', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'do', 'few', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'DVD', 'bit', 'now', 'Tutorial', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'short', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'everything', 'could', 'see', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'was', 'looking', 'cross', 'steps', 'few', 'other', 'moves', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'them.Overall', 'music', 'moves', 'are', 'here', 'great', 'dance', 'experience', 'even', 'are', 'already', 'taking', 'classes', 'are', 'looking', '34', '34', 'give', 'shot', 'very', 'good']","Piece of Cake - A Belly Dance Workout for Beginners, with Neon: Bellydance instruction, Beginner how-to, complete belly dance fitness class"
1549318,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B008AY5FDK,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[6, 6]","Belly dancing is the loveliest form of exercise I know of, and it is also a beautiful art form; it is so graceful, and tones and strengthens your muscles while also gently stretching your body and giving you agility. It is perfect for all ages, and this DVD is a great start for beginners. If you've never danced a step in your life, or if you're a once active senior who wants to get rejuvenated and moving again, this DVD won't overwhelm you with complicated choreography and difficult workouts. It's also terrific conditioning for someone who is further along in their studies.The workout is excellent, set to a variety of rhythmic music, and with Neon's detailed instruction to help you with each step. Once you learn the instructions, there is the option of practicing the steps with just the music. The steps are basic and can easily be followed, and Neon is assisted by Teena Ray and Elisheva in this portion.For learning all the basic positions and techniques, Neon teaches a long tutorial, which gives everything from correct posture to doing those dazzling shimmies. Neon is an exquisite dancer, and you simply can't do better than learn from her. Production is good with a simple black background for the workout and pastel colors for the tutorial. Music includes pieces by DJ Zen, Drumspyder, Doug Adamz, Adham Shaikh, and Phil Thornton.",5,Perfect for Beginners,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,1349,"['Belly', 'dancing', 'loveliest', 'form', 'exercise', 'know', 'also', 'beautiful', 'art', 'form', 'so', 'graceful', 'tones', 'muscles', 'also', 'gently', 'stretching', 'body', 'giving', 'agility', 'perfect', 'ages', 'DVD', 'great', 'start', 'beginners', ""'ve"", 'never', 'danced', 'step', 'life', ""'re"", 'once', 'active', 'senior', 'who', 'get', 'rejuvenated', 'moving', 'again', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'complicated', 'choreography', 'difficult', 'workouts', 'also', 'terrific', 'conditioning', 'someone', 'who', 'further', 'along', 'studies.The', 'workout', 'excellent', 'set', 'variety', 'rhythmic', 'music', 'Neon', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'help', 'step', 'learn', 'instructions', 'option', 'practicing', 'steps', 'just', 'music', 'steps', 'are', 'basic', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'followed', 'Neon', 'assisted', 'Teena', 'Ray', 'Elisheva', 'portion.For', 'learning', 'basic', 'positions', 'techniques', 'Neon', 'long', 'tutorial', 'everything', 'correct', 'posture', 'doing', 'dazzling', 'shimmies', 'Neon', 'exquisite', 'dancer', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'learn', 'Production', 'good', 'simple', 'black', 'background', 'workout', 'pastel', 'colors', 'tutorial', 'Music', 'pieces', 'DJ', 'Zen', 'Drumspyder', 'Doug', 'Adamz', 'Adham', 'Shaikh', 'Phil', 'Thornton']","Piece of Cake - A Belly Dance Workout for Beginners, with Neon: Bellydance instruction, Beginner how-to, complete belly dance fitness class"

This program has been effective in toning and strengthening my body. Best yet, the lovely belly dance movement with its varied range of motion is mixed into fun, delightful choreographies.Topping off the six dance workout sections is a lyrical cool down section that is all about beautiful flowing movements that stretch the arms, shoulders, and spine while deep lunges strengthen lower body extremities.  It's easy to be lured in by the music, which makes the workout appear so subtle, yet the impact is soon felt as the toning begins to set in.A tutorial section is included and eases anyone from basic foundations into choreographies that build gradually with enough repetition to create a very enjoyable work out for the entire body.",5,Delicious and non fattening!,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,831,"['have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'Piece', 'Cake', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Workout', 'beginners', 'several', 'weeks', 'program', 'been', 'effective', 'toning', 'strengthening', 'body', 'Best', 'yet', 'lovely', 'belly', 'dance', 'movement', 'varied', 'range', 'motion', 'mixed', 'fun', 'delightful', 'choreographies.Topping', 'off', 'six', 'dance', 'workout', 'sections', 'lyrical', 'cool', 'down', 'section', 'beautiful', 'flowing', 'movements', 'stretch', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'spine', 'deep', 'lunges', 'strengthen', 'lower', 'body', 'extremities', 'easy', 'be', 'lured', 'music', 'workout', 'appear', 'so', 'subtle', 'impact', 'soon', 'felt', 'toning', 'set', 'in.A', 'tutorial', 'section', 'included', 'anyone', 'basic', 'foundations', 'choreographies', 'build', 'gradually', 'enough', 'repetition', 'create', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'work', 'out', 'entire', 'body']","Piece of Cake - A Belly Dance Workout for Beginners, with Neon: Bellydance instruction, Beginner how-to, complete belly dance fitness class"
