851864,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B0002YLCWY,David R. Eastwood,"[11, 13]","Director Lynne Stopkewich has dealt with a very important topic here: the low self-esteem some women suffer from AND the cruel ways that some men take terrible advantage of such women.The two lead actors--Molly Parker and Callum Keith Rennie--are excellent in their roles as the abused woman, Leila Murray, and the abuser, Gary Jensen. The rest of the cast manages to be adequate. (By an eerily odd coincidence, two of the minor cast members--Don S. Davis as Golf Shirt Man, and Michael Shanks as Ball Cap Man--both went on to star in the TV series ""Stargate SG-1."")Two main problems with this low-budget effort are the production values and the script. Technically, this often looks like a class project for an undergrad course in film making, with the lighting and color being major difficulties. The script is uneven, too, with its heavy-handed parallel subplot and its ""happy ending"" that is too rushed, sketchy, and implausible. As for the symbolic swans that hang out in the river, they may be just what YOU like, but to me they seemed like one more pretentiously artsy thing that a teacher in Screenplays 101 should have advised the writer(s) to cut out.If you like Molly Parker, watch her in Stopkewich's KISSED and in the HBO-TV series ""Deadwood.""

851868,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0002YLCWY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","&lt;strong>Suspicious River&lt;/strong> (Lynne Stopkewich, 2000)There's something about this movie that's just not right.That is a statement that may not make sense, at least not coming from me. After all, the last time Stopkewich and Parker teamed up, they made &lt;em>Kissed&lt;/em>, the 1996 film based on Barbara Gowdy's short story ""We So Seldom Look on Love"", in turn based on the story (and trial) of necrophile Karen Greenlee. And &lt;em>Kissed&lt;/em> has been on my list of the hundred best movies ever made for well over a decade now. Given that, what variable changed to make this movie... well, not &lt;em>Kissed&lt;/em>?The obvious, if possibly facile, answer is the source material. I will note right up front that I have not read the Laura Kasischke novel upon which this movie is based, and so everything I'm about to say here is pure, unadulterated speculation based on the past performances of the appropriate parties. But there's a men-are-evil streak that runs a mile wide through this movie. It doesn't appear in &lt;em>Kissed&lt;/em>; while the male lead there is something of a heel, he's at least a well-meaning heel, who tries to figure out ways to make himself more attractive to Parker's necrophile because he has a genuine fondness for her (rather than just a fascination for her particular kink). On the other hand, and I should probably put SPOILER here just in case, there's not a single male character in &lt;em>Suspicious River&lt;/em> who doesn't deserve to be removed from the gene pool immediately, while the movie's women, what few of them there are (the more to make room for disgusting, nasty men, of course), are all saints or angels, driven to the extremes they go to because they are forced to live in the male-dominated world. Which may sound like exaggeration. Trust me, it isn't.Leila (Parker) is a front desk clerk at a motel in the backwoods town of Suspicious River. The area is economically depressed and Leila's husband is a good-for-nothing layabout, so offered the choice at one point, Leila takes up prostitution, servicing hotel customers who want a little something more than the continental breakfast with their rooms. Initially, this is presented in a detached, almost whimsical fashion (there's a great cameo by the late, great Don Davis as one of her early clients), but all that changes when she's approached by, and beds, Gary Jensen (&lt;em>Memento&lt;/em>'s Callum Keith Rennie), who turns out to be a local and wants to keep seeing her. (If you've seen the film, did it cross your mind as well that in a town this small, how did she not know this guy already?) After one of her dates goes bad, instead of turning to her husband, Leila finds herself calling Gary, and soon enough, the wheels are set in motion for the tragedy we know is going to occur, for Gary, too, is married. There's also a subplot with a little girl (&lt;em>30 Days of Night: Dark Days&lt;/em>' Katie Keating) who lives in a house close to the motel who idolizes Leila, but that subplot, and the deeper meaning behind it, kind of get short shrift in this screenplay.Despite my ranting and raving in the opening paragraph, I don't want to imply that you shouldn't see this film. If for no other reason, you should see it because Parker's performance, as all of her performances I've seen to date, is powerful and lovely. I grant you, from what I have read of the novel underlying this film, had her character been as complex as Leila-the-novel-character was, she might have stepped into Oscar territory with it, but what we get is about what one would expect from an actress of Parker's estimable caliber. More surprising is the turn from Rennie, who inhabits his scumbag with an enthusiasm that's kind of disturbing, really. Stopkewich once again teams up with DP Gregory Middleton (&lt;em>Slither&lt;/em>), who does really, really good work in the kind of outdoors-woodsy-claustrophobic settings Stopkewich uses for her pictures, and once again he does a fantastic job of making this all look as bleak and barren as it should be.It could be much more than it is, but what's here is worth your time, at least. ***",3,"Could have been much better, but not terrible.",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,4149,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Suspicious', 'River', 'lt', '>', 'Lynne', 'Stopkewich', '2000', 'something', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'right.That', 'statement', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'least', 'not', 'coming', 'last', 'time', 'Stopkewich', 'Parker', 'teamed', 'up', 'made', 'lt', '>', 'Kissed', 'lt', '>', '1996', 'film', 'based', 'Barbara', 'Gowdy', 'short', 'story', 'So', 'Seldom', 'Look', 'Love', 'turn', 'based', 'story', 'trial', 'necrophile', 'Karen', 'Greenlee', 'lt', '>', 'Kissed', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'been', 'list', 'hundred', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'well', 'decade', 'now', 'Given', 'what', 'variable', 'changed', 'make', 'movie', 'well', 'not', 'lt', '>', 'Kissed', 'lt', '>', 'obvious', 'possibly', 'facile', 'answer', 'source', 'material', 'will', 'note', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Laura', 'Kasischke', 'novel', 'upon', 'movie', 'based', 'so', 'everything', ""'m"", 'say', 'here', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'speculation', 'based', 'past', 'performances', 'appropriate', 'parties', 'men-are-evil', 'streak', 'mile', 'wide', 'movie', ""n't"", 'appear', 'lt', '>', 'Kissed', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'male', 'lead', 'something', 'heel', 'least', 'well-meaning', 'heel', 'who', 'figure', 'out', 'ways', 'make', 'more', 'attractive', 'Parker', 'necrophile', 'genuine', 'fondness', 'rather', 'just', 'fascination', 'particular', 'kink', 'other', 'hand', 'should', 'probably', 'put', 'SPOILER', 'here', 'just', 'case', 'not', 'single', 'male', 'character', 'lt', '>', 'Suspicious', 'River', 'lt', '>', 'who', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'removed', 'gene', 'pool', 'immediately', 'movie', 'women', 'what', 'few', 'are', 'more', 'make', 'room', 'disgusting', 'nasty', 'men', 'course', 'are', 'saints', 'angels', 'driven', 'extremes', 'go', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'male-dominated', 'world', 'may', 'sound', 'exaggeration', 'Trust', 'Parker', 'front', 'desk', 'clerk', 'motel', 'backwoods', 'town', 'Suspicious', 'River', 'area', 'economically', 'depressed', 'Leila', 'husband', 'good-for-nothing', 'layabout', 'so', 'offered', 'choice', 'one', 'point', 'Leila', 'up', 'prostitution', 'servicing', 'hotel', 'customers', 'who', 'want', 'little', 'something', 'more', 'continental', 'breakfast', 'rooms', 'Initially', 'presented', 'detached', 'almost', 'whimsical', 'fashion', 'great', 'cameo', 'late', 'great', 'Don', 'Davis', 'one', 'early', 'clients', 'changes', 'when', 'approached', 'beds', 'Gary', 'Jensen', 'lt', '>', 'Memento', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'local', 'keep', 'seeing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'did', 'cross', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'town', 'small', 'how', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'guy', 'already', 'one', 'dates', 'bad', 'instead', 'turning', 'husband', 'Leila', 'calling', 'Gary', 'soon', 'enough', 'wheels', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'tragedy', 'know', 'going', 'occur', 'Gary', 'too', 'married', 'also', 'subplot', 'little', 'girl', 'lt', '>', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'Dark', 'Days', 'lt', '>', 'Katie', 'Keating', 'who', 'house', 'close', 'motel', 'who', 'Leila', 'subplot', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'kind', 'get', 'short', 'shrift', 'screenplay.Despite', 'ranting', 'raving', 'opening', 'paragraph', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'imply', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'other', 'reason', 'should', 'see', 'Parker', 'performance', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'powerful', 'lovely', 'grant', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'underlying', 'film', 'had', 'character', 'been', 'as', 'complex', 'Leila-the-novel-character', 'was', 'might', 'have', 'stepped', 'Oscar', 'territory', 'what', 'get', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'actress', 'Parker', 'estimable', 'caliber', 'More', 'surprising', 'turn', 'Rennie', 'who', 'scumbag', 'enthusiasm', 'kind', 'disturbing', 'really', 'Stopkewich', 'once', 'again', 'teams', 'up', 'DP', 'Gregory', 'Middleton', 'lt', '>', 'Slither', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'who', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'work', 'kind', 'outdoors-woodsy-claustrophobic', 'settings', 'Stopkewich', 'pictures', 'once', 'again', 'fantastic', 'job', 'making', 'look', 'bleak', 'barren', 'should', 'be.It', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'here', 'time', 'least', '***']",N/A

851871,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0002YLCWY,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","My husband and I watched this as an instant play via a movie rental site we subscribe to. The reason I chose this was because I like Molly Parker's acting, and this seemed like an interesting independent flick based on some reviews I had read. I was not prepared for the emotional impact of this movie, which is hard hitting.Molly Parker plays Leila Murray, a young woman living in a small town, stuck in a monotonous and boring job (receptionist at a hotel), and also `trapped' in a stale marriage. At first, I wondered why Leila seemed so emotionally detached from her husband, but the reason becomes apparent as the movie progresses. Leila is a very troubled young woman, scarred by her childhood experiences which become apparent as the plot unfolds. She seeks solace by subjecting herself to debasement at the hands of the male customers who come into the hotel - she offers `extra' services for a fee, prostituting herself, in a desperate attempt to fill the emotional void in her life.Things change when she meets a dangerous and handsome stranger, Gary Jensen (Callum Keith Rennie). Initially, Jensen and Leila get off to an explosive start when he hits her in a moment of passion. Later, the relationship becomes more intense and passionate and Leila slowly finds herself falling in love with Jensen, ignoring everything else. She even leaves her job for Jensen, but is Jensen her savior or tormentor?There is another interesting parallel story involving a young girl who befriends Leila and acts as her `conscience'. This young girl's role also becomes clearer as the story progresses. There is even a hint of a supernatural element toward the end of the story. For an indie movie, this is quite well done. Viewers will have to ignore the cheap production qualities, but the acting, especially by the two leads is compelling. This is a gritty drama about a young woman's journey into darkness and is hard to watch, yet riveting.",4,"Gritty and disturbing, yet compelling",1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,1938,"['husband', 'watched', 'instant', 'play', 'movie', 'rental', 'site', 'subscribe', 'reason', 'chose', 'was', 'like', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'acting', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'independent', 'flick', 'based', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'emotional', 'impact', 'movie', 'hard', 'hitting.Molly', 'Parker', 'Leila', 'Murray', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'stuck', 'monotonous', 'boring', 'job', 'receptionist', 'hotel', 'also', 'trapped', 'stale', 'marriage', 'first', 'wondered', 'why', 'Leila', 'seemed', 'so', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'husband', 'reason', 'apparent', 'movie', 'Leila', 'very', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'scarred', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'become', 'apparent', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'solace', 'subjecting', 'debasement', 'hands', 'male', 'customers', 'who', 'come', 'hotel', 'extra', 'services', 'fee', 'prostituting', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'fill', 'emotional', 'void', 'life.Things', 'change', 'when', 'dangerous', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'Gary', 'Jensen', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'Initially', 'Jensen', 'Leila', 'get', 'off', 'explosive', 'start', 'when', 'moment', 'passion', 'Later', 'relationship', 'more', 'intense', 'passionate', 'Leila', 'slowly', 'falling', 'love', 'Jensen', 'ignoring', 'everything', 'else', 'even', 'job', 'Jensen', 'Jensen', 'savior', 'tormentor', 'interesting', 'parallel', 'story', 'involving', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'Leila', 'conscience', 'young', 'girl', 'role', 'also', 'clearer', 'story', 'even', 'hint', 'supernatural', 'element', 'end', 'story', 'indie', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'Viewers', 'will', 'have', 'ignore', 'cheap', 'production', 'qualities', 'acting', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'compelling', 'gritty', 'drama', 'young', 'woman', 'journey', 'darkness', 'hard', 'watch', 'yet', 'riveting']",N/A
