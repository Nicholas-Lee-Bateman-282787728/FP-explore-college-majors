221825,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6300216527,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is an excellent psychological film that deserves a revisit and a re-evaluation.  It is the story of a compulsive gambler who is truly addicted to gambling despite the many disasters that accompany this addiction. James Caan is excellent and perfectly portrays that those with such an addiction may act rationally in most of their life but in the area of their addictive compulsion, they have no control. Addictions of all sorts bring negative consequences and yet the addicted person hangs on to the behavior despite the pain that they go through and which is also inflicted on those around them.James Caan plays Axel Freed, the son of a highly successful mother and the grandson of a highly successful business man.  He has become a professor of literature. Yet, his addiction, at first hidden, emerges until everyone around him sees the self destruction that this had evoked.  His girlfriend, played by beautiful Lauren Hutton, is initially supportive, and then tries to be co-dependent, and then eventually his addiction takes a toll on their relationship.Gambling addiction results in Axel spiraling downward into the rough life of organized crime and pay-offs.  Paul Sorvino plays a successful bookie who actually cares that Axel is falling ever deeper into his addiction.  The use of the music of Mahler was very effective and unexpected. I think it was a really good, under-rated classic film that deserves a second look by current movie viewers.",4,Very realistic portrayal of the downward spiral of addiction to gambling,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,1458,"['excellent', 'psychological', 'film', 'revisit', 're-evaluation', 'story', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'who', 'truly', 'addicted', 'gambling', 'many', 'disasters', 'accompany', 'addiction', 'James', 'Caan', 'excellent', 'perfectly', 'portrays', 'such', 'addiction', 'may', 'act', 'rationally', 'most', 'life', 'area', 'addictive', 'compulsion', 'have', 'control', 'Addictions', 'sorts', 'bring', 'negative', 'consequences', 'yet', 'addicted', 'person', 'hangs', 'behavior', 'pain', 'go', 'also', 'inflicted', 'them.James', 'Caan', 'Axel', 'Freed', 'son', 'highly', 'successful', 'mother', 'grandson', 'highly', 'successful', 'business', 'man', 'become', 'professor', 'literature', 'addiction', 'first', 'hidden', 'everyone', 'self', 'destruction', 'had', 'evoked', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'initially', 'supportive', 'then', 'tries', 'be', 'co-dependent', 'then', 'eventually', 'addiction', 'toll', 'relationship.Gambling', 'addiction', 'results', 'Axel', 'spiraling', 'downward', 'rough', 'life', 'organized', 'crime', 'pay-offs', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'successful', 'bookie', 'who', 'actually', 'Axel', 'falling', 'ever', 'deeper', 'addiction', 'use', 'music', 'Mahler', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'unexpected', 'think', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'under-rated', 'classic', 'film', 'second', 'look', 'current', 'movie', 'viewers']",Gambler VHS

221827,A280GY5UVUS2QH,6300216527,Doug Anderson,"[1, 1]","James Caan was in some of the hardest hitting films by some of the hardest hitting directors of the seventies and early eighties including Coppola's Godfather I(72), Sam Peckinpah's The Killer Elite (75)and Michael Mann's Thief (81). He also played a number of athlete roles, including Rollerball(75). Whether he's playing an athlete or not Caan moves like an athlete, and he gets jumpy if he has to sit still for too long, and so he's interesting to watch even when he's just crossing the street because its like he's always on the scent of something, always on the prowl.In the opening scenes of Gambler (74) Caan is playing the tables in an all-night casino and losing one hand after another. By morning, as he's driving home, he realizes he has lost 44,000 dollars. But the jumpy Caan still hasn't been satisfied and when he sees some teens playing basketball he stops his car and hustles up a game. They only have ten bucks but thats enough. It's the thrill of the game and the thrill of the bet that turns him on and he really comes to life on the courts.His real job we soon find out is pretty high class. He's a college English professor who lectures on Dostoyevsky and the failed/corrupted/compromised American dream (good solid early 70's staple topic that last one). And he does it really well. He's certainly not your usual professor because its obvious just by looking at him and listening to him that he's more physycal than mental and he's actually interested in the thrill of living life and not the agony of writing books about it. Caan's ""Axel Freed"" is a guy who has seen a lot and done a lot and his students appreciate that he's not a guy who spends his afternoons in the library. But where he does spend his afternoons and evenings is getting him in deep trouble.The gambling problem seems to stem from the fact that he's never really escaped from the safe confines and purse strings of his social class and this embarrases him and makes him feel inauthentic and unmanly. Its like he was born to a reality or class that never fit, and he's been trying to return to his rightful home (the streets, the basketball courts, the tennis courts, the boxing ring) ever since. Money has always stood between Axel Freed and the life he imagines tobe his own. Even when at home with his lady he can't stand still; he's perpetually shadow boxing in the mirror and perusing the sports page and ringin' up his bookie. Day to day, moment to moment, he lives for the thrill of those last seconds of a game when his whole life depends on whether the basketball will or will not go in. Watching him take incredible risks is painful because we fear where it will all lead, but its also exhilerating.Caan is tough in The Gambler, no doubt, but the role of Axel Freed allows him to stretch and show that he can play not only a physical guy but a physical guy with a lot going on in his head. Its a pleasure to see James Caan sitting in front of an English class lecturing to a group of attentive students about why man does not always follow the dictates of reason. ""Reason,"" Axel reads from his copy of Dostoyevsky, ""satisfies our rational requirements, but desire encompasses everything."" What makes this especially interesting is that we know Axel Freed isn't just some egghead with a set of theories but that he's taking his lessons from real life.Axel seems to have a great job and a great sexy girlfriend (Lauren Hutton) but its just not enough to keep his attention; he needs that extra adrenalin rush that only extreme situations that sports and gambling and pushin' the bounds of reason can provide.The film reminds me of Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces but its much grittier and the ending is so unexpected and raw that many may be turned off by it but it has the advantage of giving you a final glimpse of this character that you are not likely to forget.Unexpected ending but hits right where it should.If you wanted to you could probably analyze this film from a number of angles. One being that modern man just isn't satisfied living in his settled society doing mundane tasks but then that might sound too academic and too trite and thats just what Axel's trying to escape from.O yes the film is like a yearbook of seventies actors as there are about fifteen recognizable faces in supporting roles: including Lauren Hutton as girlfriend, Paul Sorvino as bookie, Huggie Bear as a pimp, and James Woods as a snotty bank clerk who Caan has to rough up.Karel Reisz was himself a Jewish refugee from Czechoslovakia. He fled to the UK to escape the Holocaust so the story of Axel Freed's uncle is especially interesting in that light. Reisz also directed another tremendous seventies film called Who'll Stop the Rain (1978) based on Robert Stone's Dog Soldiers and starring Nick Nolte and Tuesday Weld.",4,The Thrill of it All,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,4808,"['James', 'Caan', 'was', 'hardest', 'hitting', 'films', 'hardest', 'hitting', 'directors', 'seventies', 'early', 'eighties', 'including', 'Coppola', 'Godfather', '72', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'Killer', 'Elite', '75', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Thief', '81', 'also', 'played', 'number', 'athlete', 'roles', 'including', 'Rollerball', '75', 'playing', 'athlete', 'not', 'Caan', 'athlete', 'jumpy', 'sit', 'still', 'too', 'long', 'so', 'interesting', 'watch', 'even', 'when', 'just', 'crossing', 'street', 'always', 'scent', 'something', 'always', 'prowl.In', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Gambler', '74', 'Caan', 'playing', 'tables', 'all-night', 'casino', 'losing', 'one', 'hand', 'morning', 'driving', 'home', 'lost', '44,000', 'dollars', 'jumpy', 'Caan', 'still', ""n't"", 'been', 'satisfied', 'when', 'teens', 'playing', 'basketball', 'car', 'up', 'game', 'only', 'have', 'ten', 'bucks', 'thats', 'enough', 'thrill', 'game', 'thrill', 'bet', 'really', 'life', 'courts.His', 'real', 'job', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'pretty', 'high', 'class', 'college', 'English', 'professor', 'who', 'Dostoyevsky', 'failed/corrupted/compromised', 'American', 'dream', 'good', 'solid', 'early', '70', 'staple', 'topic', 'last', 'one', 'really', 'well', 'certainly', 'not', 'usual', 'professor', 'obvious', 'just', 'looking', 'listening', 'more', 'physycal', 'mental', 'actually', 'interested', 'thrill', 'living', 'life', 'not', 'agony', 'writing', 'books', 'Caan', 'Axel', 'Freed', 'guy', 'who', 'seen', 'lot', 'done', 'lot', 'students', 'appreciate', 'not', 'guy', 'who', 'afternoons', 'library', 'where', 'spend', 'afternoons', 'evenings', 'getting', 'deep', 'trouble.The', 'gambling', 'problem', 'stem', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'escaped', 'safe', 'confines', 'purse', 'strings', 'social', 'class', 'feel', 'inauthentic', 'unmanly', 'was', 'born', 'reality', 'class', 'never', 'fit', 'been', 'trying', 'return', 'rightful', 'home', 'streets', 'basketball', 'courts', 'tennis', 'courts', 'boxing', 'ring', 'ever', 'Money', 'always', 'stood', 'Axel', 'Freed', 'life', 'tobe', 'own', 'Even', 'when', 'home', 'lady', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'still', 'perpetually', 'shadow', 'boxing', 'mirror', 'perusing', 'sports', 'page', 'ringin', 'up', 'bookie', 'Day', 'day', 'moment', 'moment', 'thrill', 'last', 'seconds', 'game', 'when', 'whole', 'life', 'basketball', 'will', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'Watching', 'take', 'incredible', 'risks', 'painful', 'fear', 'where', 'will', 'lead', 'also', 'exhilerating.Caan', 'tough', 'Gambler', 'doubt', 'role', 'Axel', 'Freed', 'stretch', 'show', 'can', 'play', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'guy', 'physical', 'guy', 'lot', 'going', 'head', 'pleasure', 'see', 'James', 'Caan', 'sitting', 'front', 'English', 'class', 'lecturing', 'group', 'attentive', 'students', 'why', 'man', 'not', 'always', 'follow', 'dictates', 'reason', 'Reason', 'Axel', 'copy', 'Dostoyevsky', 'rational', 'requirements', 'desire', 'encompasses', 'everything', 'What', 'especially', 'interesting', 'know', 'Axel', 'Freed', ""n't"", 'just', 'egghead', 'set', 'theories', 'taking', 'lessons', 'real', 'life.Axel', 'have', 'great', 'job', 'great', 'sexy', 'girlfriend', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'extra', 'adrenalin', 'rush', 'only', 'extreme', 'situations', 'sports', 'gambling', 'pushin', 'bounds', 'reason', 'can', 'provide.The', 'film', 'reminds', 'Rafelson', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'much', 'grittier', 'ending', 'so', 'unexpected', 'raw', 'many', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'advantage', 'giving', 'final', 'glimpse', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'forget.Unexpected', 'ending', 'hits', 'right', 'where', 'wanted', 'could', 'probably', 'analyze', 'film', 'number', 'angles', 'One', 'being', 'modern', 'man', 'just', ""n't"", 'satisfied', 'living', 'settled', 'society', 'doing', 'mundane', 'tasks', 'then', 'might', 'sound', 'too', 'academic', 'too', 'trite', 'thats', 'just', 'what', 'Axel', 'trying', 'escape', 'from.O', 'film', 'yearbook', 'seventies', 'actors', 'are', 'fifteen', 'recognizable', 'supporting', 'roles', 'including', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'girlfriend', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'bookie', 'Huggie', 'Bear', 'pimp', 'James', 'Woods', 'snotty', 'bank', 'clerk', 'who', 'Caan', 'rough', 'up.Karel', 'Reisz', 'was', 'Jewish', 'refugee', 'Czechoslovakia', 'fled', 'UK', 'escape', 'Holocaust', 'story', 'Axel', 'Freed', 'uncle', 'especially', 'interesting', 'light', 'Reisz', 'also', 'directed', 'tremendous', 'seventies', 'film', 'called', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'Stop', 'Rain', '1978', 'based', 'Robert', 'Stone', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'starring', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Tuesday', 'Weld']",Gambler VHS
221828,APYCNRS112N2B,6300216527,Eat The Rich Books,"[3, 4]","I grew up amongst gamblers, spending much of my time hustling bowling and gin rummy throughout the Midwest, until, at 17, I shuffled off to the Ivy-covered walls of a prestigious Eastern College.This gives me much  simpatico with Axel Freed, the central character and portrait of  self-destruction, the gambler, and James Toback, the film's author.  Toback's own reflections suggest that Axel is in many ways  auto-biographical.As a film, The Gambler is shortsighted, an ambitious  but nonetheless failed attempt by a first-time screenwriter in difficult  waters. It is not without its brilliance-its relentless dedication toward  conveying that any gambler's true goal is not success, but utter  humiliation-destruction of one's self, and anything and anyone around him.  It can be no other way.In the 1990's where independent film has achieved  an emergence and respect in its own, a film like this might have found the  strength among the very talented people involved, (Toback, James Caan,  Karel Reisz) to emerge into a true gem. Alas this 70's neglected studio  cast-off didn't have that opportunity.London Lee is great in support,  Paul Sorvino and Burt Young are well cast as Freed's mob-ties. Young's  performance as a mob leg-breaker includes quite a raw, and shocking  collection scene.Probably a pass for any but the gambling addict, for  them, a head (as in tape-head) burner. For those who are intrigued by  Toback's intelligent approach to the seedier side, try his next effort,  Fingers (1978), a diamond in the rough.",3,Why not quit while you&#65533;re ahead?,950313600,"02 12, 2000",2000,1534,"['grew', 'up', 'amongst', 'gamblers', 'spending', 'much', 'time', 'hustling', 'bowling', 'gin', 'rummy', 'Midwest', '17', 'shuffled', 'off', 'Ivy-covered', 'walls', 'prestigious', 'Eastern', 'College.This', 'much', 'simpatico', 'Axel', 'Freed', 'central', 'character', 'portrait', 'self-destruction', 'gambler', 'James', 'Toback', 'film', 'author', 'Toback', 'own', 'reflections', 'suggest', 'Axel', 'many', 'ways', 'auto-biographical.As', 'film', 'Gambler', 'shortsighted', 'ambitious', 'nonetheless', 'failed', 'attempt', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'difficult', 'waters', 'not', 'brilliance-its', 'relentless', 'dedication', 'conveying', 'gambler', 'true', 'goal', 'not', 'success', 'utter', 'humiliation-destruction', 'one', 'self', 'anything', 'anyone', 'around', 'can', 'be', 'other', '1990', 'where', 'independent', 'film', 'achieved', 'emergence', 'respect', 'own', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'found', 'strength', 'very', 'talented', 'people', 'involved', 'Toback', 'James', 'Caan', 'Karel', 'Reisz', 'emerge', 'true', 'gem', 'Alas', '70', 'neglected', 'studio', 'cast-off', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'opportunity.London', 'Lee', 'great', 'support', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'Burt', 'Young', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'Freed', 'mob-ties', 'Young', 'performance', 'mob', 'leg-breaker', 'quite', 'raw', 'shocking', 'collection', 'scene.Probably', 'pass', 'gambling', 'addict', 'head', 'tape-head', 'burner', 'who', 'are', 'intrigued', 'Toback', 'intelligent', 'approach', 'seedier', 'side', 'try', 'next', 'effort', 'Fingers', '1978', 'diamond', 'rough']",Gambler VHS

221831,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,6300216527,Hillary,"[4, 4]","Veteran legendary actor James Caan was at his peak 10 years into his on-screen career in this James Toback classic.  Director Karel Reisz gets one of Caan's most convincing performances to date, as well as terrific support from the rest of this well recognized ensemble cast.Caan plays Axel Freed, an English Lit professor, who comes from a well-to-do family.  Although Axel has success in his career and a beautiful, but detached girlfriend played by70s covergirl Lauren Hutton, he's looking for something far LESS out of life.  He is a hopeless gambling junkie.  Caan is so terrific and tragic as a man who can't control himself in the face of any kind of risky wager.  He'll take the worst odds, never quit while he's ahead, and certainly NEVER knows when to fold 'em.  Axel seems to be happiest as the loser ironically, because he never keeps his winnings, just wagering again until the profit is lost.Paul Sorvino, another veteran talent is in a very early role here as ""Hips"", Axel's bookie.  Hips has done just about everything he can do to convince Axel of his self-destructive habit, but to no avail.  In a terrific scene, Axel gets a good look at his future, as he is sent to collect a debt from a deadbeat with an enforcer played by real life buddy, Burt Young, more famous for being ""Rocky"" brother-in-law.  Axel watches as the deadbeat has his furnishings demolished by an abusive Young, and gets a solid working over culminating in some broken bones.  Does this spell the future for Axel?  You have to see for yourself.James Caan has never looked so good, or played such a gut-wrenching role.  The scene where he's sitting in his bathtub listening to a game he's got a crucial bet on, causes you to actually feel his desperation.  We are not so sure he actually wants to win though.  He seems to crave the humiliation of being the loser more than the victory of being a winner.  He even humiliates himself in front of his students by trying to fix a college basketball game, to pay yet another debt he's accrued.Besides Sorvino, Hutton, and Young, there are also other classic screen veterans to catch in small roles.  When Caan pleads with his doctor mom to give him her savings,  they deal with the terrific James Woods, as a banker who asks for one too many forms of ID.  Vic Tayback is seen as well.If you are a James Caan fan, as I am, and you want to see an example of some of his finest dramatic work, I highly recommend ""The Gambler"" as well as his subsequent 1981 Michael Mann classic ""Thief"" (see my review) as two of my favorites in his vast filmography.  For comedy, Caan is classic as ANOTHER gambler in the hilarious ""Honeymoon In Vegas""(see my review for more).""The Gambler"" is without doubt, one of the finest dramatizations of the degradation, the hopelessness, the fleeting thrill, and the moral bankruptcy that awaits  any individual with this addiction.  We as viewers will become hooked on this amazing story, but, unlike Axel Freed, we will gain from this experience, with nothing to lose.",5,A Winner In Every Sense...,1025136000,"06 27, 2002",2002,3025,"['Veteran', 'legendary', 'actor', 'James', 'Caan', 'was', 'peak', '10', 'years', 'on-screen', 'career', 'James', 'Toback', 'classic', 'Director', 'Karel', 'Reisz', 'one', 'Caan', 'most', 'convincing', 'performances', 'date', 'as', 'well', 'terrific', 'support', 'rest', 'well', 'recognized', 'ensemble', 'cast.Caan', 'plays', 'Axel', 'Freed', 'English', 'Lit', 'professor', 'who', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'Axel', 'success', 'career', 'beautiful', 'detached', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'by70s', 'covergirl', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'looking', 'something', 'far', 'LESS', 'life', 'hopeless', 'gambling', 'junkie', 'Caan', 'so', 'terrific', 'tragic', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'face', 'kind', 'risky', 'wager', ""'ll"", 'take', 'worst', 'odds', 'never', 'quit', 'ahead', 'certainly', 'NEVER', 'when', 'fold', 'Axel', 'be', 'happiest', 'loser', 'ironically', 'never', 'winnings', 'just', 'wagering', 'again', 'profit', 'lost.Paul', 'Sorvino', 'veteran', 'talent', 'very', 'early', 'role', 'here', 'Hips', 'Axel', 'bookie', 'Hips', 'done', 'just', 'everything', 'can', 'do', 'convince', 'Axel', 'self-destructive', 'habit', 'avail', 'terrific', 'scene', 'Axel', 'good', 'look', 'future', 'sent', 'collect', 'debt', 'deadbeat', 'enforcer', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'buddy', 'Burt', 'Young', 'more', 'famous', 'being', 'Rocky', 'brother-in-law', 'Axel', 'deadbeat', 'furnishings', 'demolished', 'abusive', 'Young', 'solid', 'working', 'culminating', 'broken', 'bones', 'spell', 'future', 'Axel', 'have', 'see', 'yourself.James', 'Caan', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'played', 'gut-wrenching', 'role', 'scene', 'where', 'sitting', 'bathtub', 'listening', 'game', 'got', 'crucial', 'bet', 'actually', 'feel', 'desperation', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'actually', 'win', 'though', 'crave', 'humiliation', 'being', 'loser', 'more', 'victory', 'being', 'winner', 'even', 'front', 'students', 'trying', 'fix', 'college', 'basketball', 'game', 'pay', 'yet', 'debt', 'accrued.Besides', 'Sorvino', 'Hutton', 'Young', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'classic', 'screen', 'veterans', 'catch', 'small', 'roles', 'When', 'Caan', 'doctor', 'mom', 'give', 'savings', 'deal', 'terrific', 'James', 'Woods', 'banker', 'who', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'forms', 'ID', 'Vic', 'Tayback', 'seen', 'well.If', 'are', 'James', 'Caan', 'fan', 'am', 'want', 'see', 'example', 'finest', 'dramatic', 'work', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Gambler', 'as', 'well', 'subsequent', '1981', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'classic', 'Thief', 'see', 'review', 'two', 'favorites', 'vast', 'filmography', 'comedy', 'Caan', 'classic', 'ANOTHER', 'gambler', 'hilarious', 'Honeymoon', 'Vegas', 'see', 'review', 'more', 'Gambler', 'doubt', 'one', 'finest', 'dramatizations', 'degradation', 'hopelessness', 'fleeting', 'thrill', 'moral', 'bankruptcy', 'individual', 'addiction', 'viewers', 'will', 'become', 'hooked', 'amazing', 'story', 'Axel', 'Freed', 'will', 'gain', 'experience', 'nothing', 'lose']",Gambler VHS
221832,A3UMK686TRN35G,6300216527,John Nixon,"[0, 0]",This film shows the mentality and thought process of someone who is a gambling addict. The lengths that James Caan goes to keep playing even though his ability to pick winners has eroded and the affect it has on those in his life is right on the mark.

Caan's character (Axel Freed) represents a complex individual who is a study in contadictions. His chaotic spiral into the depths of his addiction both mirrors and contrasts with the insightful portaits of his classroom lectures. His societal role as gifted college professor and child of a nouveau-riche immigrant family contradicts a wholey individualistic and reckless lifestyle in constant search for the emotional rush of living on the edge. This, his true addiction, is revealed at the end of the film when his gambling ""career"" has seemingly ended. A rare sub-commentary contrasts the humanly personal sides of Axel's mob associates with their violent career personas, bringing to mind the movie Mean Streets (with the youthful pairing of Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro). Indeed, the movie may suffer from attempting to deal with these general themes on too many levels.A few graphic scenes and raw emotionalism give this film an edge that is appropriate to its themes.

The writing by James Toback is superb and the direction by Karel Reisz is just as good.  James Caan, in one of his best roles, plays a professor of literature--an ivory tower guy who drives himself right to the edge.  The story implies that the possible reason for this is his patrician upbringing; his mother's a successful and respected physician and his uncle, an extremely successful businessman. And Axel Freed--Caan's character--needs much more than all the myriad assumptions that a blue-blooded background provides.Even his girlfriend, Mickey (broadly played by Lauren Hutton), is upscale.  Caan deftly and convincingly portrays someone who takes advantage of his class and its privileges and at the same time obsessively needs the &quot;juice&quot; of danger.  The ending is a strong finish to a great movie; Axel tests the waters of what could very likely bring the ultimate danger.  The real question is, Does he want that or not?It's interesting to see both James Woods and M. Emmett Walsh in small and early roles here, as well as some 70s stalwarts: Paul Sorvino, Vic Tayback, and Steven Keats.  The mix of the highbrow and the street is a great one.

The theory is that2+2 is not 4, it's more than that, and life shouldn't be spentcounting the minutes, hours down, but rather pushing the envelope,taking risks and enjoying the ride, the thrills while it lasts.As such, Caan's character ""in theory"" realizes he's a compulsivegambler, hopelessly addicted to all kinds of bets on all kinds ofactivities, his life hanging by a thread, and jeopardizing not onlythe love, respect of his family and girlfriend, but theirpsychological and physical well-being through a  wreckless behaviorthat sees him lose thousands of dollars. The difficulty for Caan, isaccepting his ""theoretical addition"" as ""reality"" and as  a""objective, externally verifiable and observable fact"".Clearly, Caan is at his peak, physically and mentally. The actorshows his characteristic relaxed, subtle, self-contented, easy goingand confident demeanor, until unique circumstances occur, requiringagression, physical exertion, which he delivers when called on.The film prominently features a Ford Mustang convertible in over 1/3of the film.The whole gamut of individuals implicated in gambling as an industryis shown, from collectors of illegal debts, to loan sharks (at 3%per week or 12O% annual interest), casinos, bookies, pimps,narco-traffickers, etc.Caan reflects on his inability to face or control his gamblingaddiction, with words such as "" I can't lose.

Fortunately, Axel's family is extremely wealthy, so he manages to convince his mother to give him the money.  He assures her that this is the end of the gambling.  However, as soon as he gets the money, he picks up his most recent girlfriend (Lauren Hutton) and heads to Las Vegas.""The Gambler"" is a rather good examination of how gambling can affect someone's life, as well as the lives of people around them.  Caan's character nicely exemplifies the psychology behind how many people develop gambling problems.  He explains that he's afraid of winning, not of losing.  In his class, he discusses a piece by William Carlos Williams which criticizes George Washington for being risk-averse - it's easy to draw the parallels to Axel.  Caan does a nice job here, with some relatively subtle acting.  He received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Drama - the only major award nomination the movie received.  The script by James Toback is loosely based on the novella by Dostoevsky (Axel is named Alexei in the novella).  Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes of ""The Gambler"" simply aren't very believable, as Axel's life spins further out of control and he becomes more desperate.
