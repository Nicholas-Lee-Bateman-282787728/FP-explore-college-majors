459812,A110LZFBUFYWN7,6305318123,"Cumulonimbus Harpe ""samsmylife""","[19, 19]","Cranky Bugs, along with Make Someone Happy, is one of my favorite Thomas video. The stories on here are hilarious. Especially in Lady Hatt's Birthday Party. In that one we get to see Sir Topham Hatt like we've never seen him before. This is also a very important Thomas video because it was the first one that Alec Baldwin narrated. I think that Alec Baldwin is one of the better storytellers because he was creative with the voices. James and Gordon were the only trains that he made sound bad, but in the later ones, he changes their voices back to normal. Here are the story stops:Cranky Bugs 5/5:Meet Cranky, the rude and cranky crane, hence his name. He starts bossing Percy and Thomas around at the docks. This soon causes confusion and delay and Sir Topham Hatt thinks that Thomas and Percy are to blame. But when a huge storm comes and knocks Cranky over, he ends up confessing that he caused all the confusion and delay.Lady Hatt's Birthday Party 5/5:It is Lady Hatt's birthday and Sir Topham Hatt must not be late to her party. But his car breaks down and that causes him to run a little late. Then he falls in a ditch. Sir Topham Hatt's nice suit is soiled and he has no source of transportation, will he be able to get to his wive's birthday party?Double Teething Troubles 4/5:Sir Topham Hatt gets a new diesel to help Bill and Ben at the quarry. But the new diesel has teething troubles because he is new and nervous. This causes some trouble for Bill and Ben.Thomas, Percy And Old Slow Coach 5/5:Thomas and Percy find an old coach at the scrapyard named Old Slow Coach. She is going to be broken up pretty soon because she is old and slow. Thomas and Percy want more than anything to help her but they can't figure out how. Meanwhile, there is a fire at the workman's hut. Their hut is destroyed and they don't have a home anymore, but there is an ideal home for them that they don't know about yet.Busy Going Backwards 5/5:Toad, Oliver's faithful breakvan companion, wishes that he could go foreward for a change, instead of going backwards all the time. The freight cars get mad at Toad because they think that he has no right to complain because he lucky enough to be able to look after them. So the freight cars come up with a plan that will teach Toad a lesson and make his wish of going foreward finally come true.A Better View For Gordon 6/5:Gordon is boasting again about  being the finest engine in the world. One day, he is sent to test out the new station. When he gets there, he is disappointed with the view. He thinks he should have a panoramic view, where he can see people and people can see him. He soon gets his view, but in an unexpected way.""Night Train""(Music Video) 4.5/5A slower music video that is mostly about Henry and The Flying Kipper.Again, Cranky Bugs is a great Thomas video and Alec Baldwin did great in this one.

Allen,"[2, 2]","my son likes to watch this video, but not as much as the others. alec baldwin's voice is annoying and his james role is obnoxious. the character cranky is not the best; the way the diesel is treated by the other engines for being the new guy is not the greatest either. the toad story is nice, but lady hatt's birthday is certainly not the best--more negative female roles (caroline doesn't want to work or drive fast; lady hatt is really shallow). there are better videos out there, such as ""make someone happy"" (if you don't mind baldwin's characterization of james) or maybe ""the best of percy.""",3,"umm, not the best...",1053734400,"05 24, 2003",2003,598,"['son', 'watch', 'video', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'alec', 'baldwin', 'voice', 'annoying', 'james', 'role', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'cranky', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'diesel', 'treated', 'other', 'engines', 'being', 'new', 'guy', 'not', 'greatest', 'either', 'toad', 'story', 'nice', 'lady', 'hatt', 'birthday', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'more', 'negative', 'female', 'roles', 'caroline', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'drive', 'fast', 'lady', 'hatt', 'really', 'shallow', 'are', 'better', 'videos', 'there', 'such', 'make', 'someone', 'happy', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'baldwin', 'characterization', 'james', 'maybe', 'best', 'percy']",Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends - Cranky Bugs & Other Thomas Stories VHS
459814,A3J029KBNG5MNP,6305318123,Mr. Bey,"[4, 6]",I usually critize Alec Bladwin in almost all of my Thomas reviews but I think Cranky was a good addition to the cast Derek who I don't think is ever going to be in another episode. Toad was good in this one but similar chases have occured already like in A close shave for Duck and later on in Spills chills and other Thomas thrills. I've always liked Toad and Oliver and I have like all of their stories. Old Slow Coach was good and she was in another episode. Night Train is the best song in the series. My problem with Thomas is they keep releasing new characters without using the old ones. Daisy has had three episodes total. BoCo doesn't have much either. This tape does mark a change in Thomas but I hear Alec Baldwin got fired. Of course we have to wait another month to see if the new guy is any better. This tape also introduces the new station but I don't think the other big station is still around I haven't seen it in any other recent tape. Overall this tape was good and your kids will probabaly like it.,4,Not bad,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,1019,"['usually', 'critize', 'Alec', 'Bladwin', 'almost', 'Thomas', 'reviews', 'think', 'Cranky', 'was', 'good', 'addition', 'cast', 'Derek', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'episode', 'Toad', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'similar', 'chases', 'have', 'occured', 'already', 'A', 'close', 'shave', 'Duck', 'later', 'Spills', 'chills', 'other', 'Thomas', 'thrills', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Toad', 'Oliver', 'have', 'stories', 'Old', 'Slow', 'Coach', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'episode', 'Night', 'Train', 'best', 'song', 'series', 'problem', 'Thomas', 'keep', 'releasing', 'new', 'characters', 'using', 'old', 'ones', 'Daisy', 'had', 'three', 'episodes', 'total', 'BoCo', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'tape', 'mark', 'change', 'Thomas', 'hear', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'got', 'fired', 'course', 'have', 'wait', 'month', 'see', 'new', 'guy', 'better', 'tape', 'also', 'new', 'station', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'big', 'station', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'recent', 'tape', 'Overall', 'tape', 'was', 'good', 'kids', 'will', 'probabaly']",Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends - Cranky Bugs & Other Thomas Stories VHS
