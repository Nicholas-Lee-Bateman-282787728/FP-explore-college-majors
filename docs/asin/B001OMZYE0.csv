1222892,A3QO324Z4CUNNO,B001OMZYE0,"Charles Stuckey ""stuck-fla""","[10, 13]","Trying a new review format. ""Ratings"" are a guess on the ""safe side"".Sub-genre: School ComedySituations:  Probably PG+  somewhat morbid visualsLanguage:  Probably PG+Nudity:  Probably R?Violence:  Probably PG  Cartoon violenceLanguage options: Dub, Sub no Dub with subtitles. Worse: Default is Dub with MINIMAL subtitles (there's a lot of written signs and such in the background).Special Features: This is a S.A.V.E. release, most features have been stripped. Unfortunately in this case Liner's notes are almost a necessity for us non-Otaku types who miss most of the jokes in the background because we don't know every manga and anime ever written....First: Without explanation of the references to cultural, manga and anime that are constant in this show, unless you are very knowledgable n these areas, skip the SAVE version and find a version with liner's notes. That aside, even without, it's still a pretty good series.Too many characters to develop all of them well, but it makes a good try at it. The main characters are well done though. The ""stage crew"" getting ""caught on camera"" is a running joke in the series that's amusing. The last episode being basically filler to fill time is a little disappointing.I could run on with reasons it wasn't the hit Negima! was, but I don't want to make it seem all bad. It's actually a pretty good story. Characters are unique, and often strange. (I mean that in a good way). The story goes off on tangents, but that keeps it interesting. While it won't end up on a list of my top ten favorite animes, it's worth watching and worth watching again to catch some of what you missed the first time. Many areas are above average, but sometimes the potential for great is missed, so I'd call it average and entertaining.",3,This should never have been a SAVE edition.,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,1765,"['Trying', 'new', 'review', 'format', 'Ratings', 'are', 'guess', 'safe', 'side', '.Sub-genre', 'School', 'ComedySituations', 'Probably', 'PG+', 'somewhat', 'morbid', 'visualsLanguage', 'Probably', 'PG+Nudity', 'Probably', 'R', 'Violence', 'Probably', 'PG', 'Cartoon', 'violenceLanguage', 'options', 'Dub', 'Sub', 'Dub', 'subtitles', 'Worse', 'Default', 'Dub', 'MINIMAL', 'subtitles', 'lot', 'written', 'signs', 'such', 'background', '.Special', 'Features', 'S.A.V.E', 'release', 'most', 'features', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'Unfortunately', 'case', 'Liner', 'notes', 'are', 'almost', 'necessity', 'non-Otaku', 'types', 'who', 'miss', 'most', 'jokes', 'background', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'manga', 'anime', 'ever', 'written', '.First', 'explanation', 'references', 'cultural', 'manga', 'anime', 'are', 'constant', 'show', 'are', 'very', 'knowledgable', 'areas', 'skip', 'SAVE', 'version', 'find', 'version', 'liner', 'notes', 'aside', 'even', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'series.Too', 'many', 'characters', 'develop', 'well', 'good', 'try', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'though', 'stage', 'crew', 'getting', 'caught', 'camera', 'running', 'joke', 'series', 'amusing', 'last', 'episode', 'being', 'basically', 'filler', 'fill', 'time', 'little', 'disappointing.I', 'could', 'run', 'reasons', 'was', ""n't"", 'hit', 'Negima', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'seem', 'bad', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'Characters', 'are', 'unique', 'often', 'strange', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'story', 'off', 'tangents', 'interesting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'list', 'top', 'ten', 'favorite', 'animes', 'worth', 'watching', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'catch', 'what', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'Many', 'areas', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'sometimes', 'potential', 'great', 'missed', ""'d"", 'call', 'average', 'entertaining']",Paniponi Dash: Complete

Each episode is more self contained with the class getting into situations. Or situations quite frankly coming to them.Some episodes focus on the students in her class.
