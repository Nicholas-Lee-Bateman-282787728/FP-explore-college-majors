190635,A3A3M74WE0YYPS,1573626163,anthony nasti,"[6, 6]","Well, I was a little disappointed in this dvd. Chris Farley was one of the greatest comedians to emerge in the past 20 years, and I was hoping that ""Saturday Night Live"" and Broadway Video would put together a concise tribute dvd that would feature about 20 of his greatest skits, plus a bonus feature including tributes from fellow cast members like Adam Sandler and Mike Meyers who worked with him in countless skits over the years (instead we get a short tribute by Tim Meadows). What is included here is a few classic sketches, plus some montages (""Chris In Drag"" ! Wow!).Which is not to say that this is a terrible dvd. ""Matt Foley"", ""Japanese Game Show"" (also available on ""The Best Of Mike Meyers""), ""Superfans"". ""Lunchlady"", ""Schmitt's Gay"" and ""The Herlihy Boy"" are all classics in their own right. However, I was sort of disgruntled by the montages that are spread out across the dvd and butcher ""SNL"" standards like ""The Gap Girls"" and ""Zagat's"" to mere snippets. (Both these skits are available on other dvds). Similarly, the ""Chris Farley Show"" montage cuts out some of the best interviews (though I'm glad they kept in the Paul McCartney one). Still, you can't be upset by the inclusion of ""Chippendales"".So, overall it's an okay dvd, but nowhere as great as the ones dedicated to Mike Meyers, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler and the countless others that have been honored with their own collection of classics.",3,I Was A Little Disappointed,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,1435,"['Well', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'dvd', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedians', 'emerge', 'past', '20', 'years', 'was', 'hoping', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Broadway', 'Video', 'would', 'put', 'together', 'concise', 'tribute', 'dvd', 'would', 'feature', '20', 'greatest', 'skits', 'bonus', 'feature', 'including', 'tributes', 'fellow', 'cast', 'members', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'who', 'worked', 'countless', 'skits', 'years', 'instead', 'get', 'short', 'tribute', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'What', 'included', 'here', 'few', 'classic', 'sketches', 'montages', 'Chris', 'Drag', 'Wow', '.Which', 'not', 'say', 'terrible', 'dvd', 'Matt', 'Foley', 'Japanese', 'Game', 'Show', 'also', 'available', 'Best', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'Superfans', 'Lunchlady', 'Schmitt', 'Gay', 'Herlihy', 'Boy', 'are', 'classics', 'own', 'right', 'However', 'was', 'sort', 'disgruntled', 'montages', 'are', 'spread', 'out', 'dvd', 'butcher', 'SNL', 'standards', 'Gap', 'Girls', 'Zagat', 'mere', 'snippets', 'Both', 'skits', 'are', 'available', 'other', 'dvds', 'Similarly', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'Show', 'montage', 'out', 'best', 'interviews', ""'m"", 'glad', 'kept', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'one', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'upset', 'inclusion', 'Chippendales', '.So', 'overall', 'okay', 'dvd', 'nowhere', 'as', 'great', 'ones', 'dedicated', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'countless', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'honored', 'own', 'collection', 'classics']",Saturday Night Live - The Best of Chris Farley VHS
190636,A1Q02WFA087CTF,1573626163,"Anthony Nasti ""Music Maniac""","[3, 3]","In his short tenure on this earth, Chris Farley provided us with some of the funniest moments in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; history. Heavily inspired by John Belushi (not just in his comedy but his dangerous lifestyle), he suddenly became the show's most talented physical comedians, bringing the pratfall back to households.5 years of classic comedy has been put on this dvd. Farley created for himslef a variety of classic charcaters for himself, including Matt Foley (who lives in a van down by the river!!!), Todd O'Connor of &quot;Superfans&quot; and Barney The Chippendale Auditioner. All of these classic characters are here. Also, there's his &quot;exciting&quot; impression of Laurie Davis in the &quot;Focus On Beauty&quot; sketch. There are several montages that just to show how funny he was: one where he's in drag, a montage of his talk show, one showcasing his physical comedy, an impressions montage, and one featuring outtakes from Dress Rehersal.Overall, very good. My one complaint may seem odd. There's not enough sketches featruing Adam Sandler! I know that the focus is supposed to be on Farley, but he and Adam shared so many great skecthes together, and they obviosuly bought out the best of each other. The ones with him are good, but it would have been better if &quot;Zagat's&quot; and &quot;Gap Girls&quot; (both featured briefly in the &quot;Drag Montage) were on here.

190637,A1534MBU6VJXYN,1573626163,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[2, 2]","Chris Farley was on ""Saturday Night Live"" for five years. During that time, he blessed the show with some of its most memorable moment, from the Chippendales audition to Matt Foley, motivational speaker to the Super Fans, everything he did was uprorarious. Inspired by John Belushi, Chris was also arguably the show's best physical comedian, a trait hebecame well known for. Sadly, Chris died of a drug overdose in 1997, only 34 years old. However, his rich legacy lives on with ""Saturday Night Live - The Best Of Chris Farley"".All of the great moments I've talked about are here - Chippendales, Matt Foley, Todd O'Conner, and so much more. Some of the lesser known bits had me in stitches as well. Chris was hilarious as Andrew Giuliani, pouncing all over Kevin Nealon (as Mayor Giuliani), making fart noises, etc. This is probably my favorite cold opening of all time. The ""Lunchlady Land"" musical skit may be just another way to show off Adam Sandler's hilarious songwriting talents, but Farley steals the show as the portly lunchlady (mole and all) rocking out as Sandler endless spews out choruses about sloppy joes and hoagies and grinders. And my mom absolutely loves the ""Focus On Beauty"" sketch (unfortunately this sketch has been heavily truncated due to time).I do have a few bones to pick, however. The dvd says that includes all of Chris's famous characters are here. Well, that's a bit of an overstatement. Some only appear breifly in short montages. For example, Chris's chubby 1/3 of the Gap Girls, Cindy Crawford, was as much a part of that sketch as Adam Sandler and David Spade was, and to have her relegated for appearing 30 seconds tops in the drag montage was a cheat. Likewise, I thought the ""Zagat's"" sketch was hysterical, but it too is featured briefly in the same montage. Also, two characters Chris did often alongside Chris Rock, B-Fats (from I'm Chillin'"") and Sandman (from ""The Dark Side With Nat X"") are nowhere to be found.Despite these minor complaints, this is an excellent look at one of ""SNL's"" finest.

190640,A28MAXJWDTNWQ0,1573626163,C. Falconer,"[2, 2]","Finally had a chance to watch this Chris Farley DVD last night.  Like the other two I own (Will Farrel and Phil Hartman), it had some very funny moments, and a couple of not-so-funny moments.  I thought the ""super fans"" skit was great, especially where Michael Jordan starts talking about his foundation, and the 4 guy's minds start wandering off ('da bears, 'da bears, Ditka, Sausage, 'da bulls...).  I also thought the question about coach Ditka going up against a hurricane (named Ditka) was pretty amusing.  Matt Foley, motivational speaker was hilarious!  'Look Dad, we got ourselves a regular Bill Shakespear here', and 'I hear you've been using paper not for writing lately, but rolling'.  That could have been Farley's best role.  Also, the commentary guy who kept using double-finger quotes, as he progressively got more gross ('a guy who doesn't let his scabs heal', or 'eats his dandruff flakes').  And lastly, as the guy who flips out when he finds out his coffee has been replaced by Folgers instant coffee.  Thought that was very funny.Some of the skits that didn't do much for me was the 'lunch lady' skit (looks like it had been written by 10 year olds), and the one where he's in drag talking about his latest line of skin products (Christina Applegate was REALLY miscast as Cher), and lastly.....as good a job as I thought he did as Rudy Giuliani's son Andrew, I thought it wasn't too professional making fun of a nine year old that has ADS.  Overall, I'd give the compilation a 4/5 rating.  The only skit I wish they included was the 'Little Women' one, where Chris breaks thru the ice, and hurls off a bunch of obscenities to the other women to rescue him.

190641,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1573626163,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[12, 14]","This SNL Best of Chris Farley collection came out not long after his premature death, and it is a little different from other tapes I have seen in this series.  While we do see some full-length skits, we also have scattered montages of Chris being Chris (which more often than not involved the destruction of furniture and, on occasion, brick walls).  For me, the one complete Matt Foley, Motivational Speaker, skit makes the video worthwhile all by itself.  His speech about not doing drugs to a brother and sister (played by David Spade and Christina Applegate, both of whom struggle to keep a straight face while Farley never falters) is one of the funniest things I've ever seen on Saturday Night Live.  Then there is the Chippendales dancer tryout skit, where Chris has a dance-off with Patrick Swayze, which is unforgettable.  Chris Farley was comfortable with himself and his body, and he had no qualms about performing self-deprecating humor.  Of course, there is a Super Fans skit included here (""da Bears""), but watching his character having a few heart attacks is not quite as funny as it was when he was still alive.  You get highlights of three episodes of the ""Chris Farley Show"" and a very funny Focus on Beauty infomercial with Farley playing cosmetics guru Lori Davis.  A couple of the sketches here can also be found on the Best of Adam Sandler tape, but they seem more at home here given the fact that Farley stole those scenes.  It's scary to think how many times the SNL guys put Farley in a dress, many examples of which can be found in this collection, but he never seemed to care.

Jorge Kenobi,"[3, 3]","I'm a big fan of Farley and this DVD is great, except for the omission of a skit that aired when they first played this show on television the Saturday after his death. It has always been one of my favorite Farley skits. David Hyde Pierce, Jeanane Garofalo, and David Spade are all in it with Farley, in a late 19th Century village where they are all prim and proper and go ice skating, Chris falls through the ice and starts yelling and carrying on in typical Farley fashion yelling at Garofalo 'what do mean whatever shall you do, save me you stupid whore!!' I would have given the DVD 5 stars but the fact that they altered it to add the skit of the interview with some Wilson Phillips stuff or whatever (i just FF that skit, i despise it) and the omission of the Ice Fall Skit have kept me from giving it 5 stars.

190648,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,1573626163,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[69, 73]","I've found that most people either totally love Chris Farley or, when you bring him up, make a face and say, &quot;I never really thought he was funny.&quot;  If you are in the first, and don't own this video yet, RUN  don't walk to the shopping cart and buy one. When they ran it the first  time on TV, it wasn't long after Farley's death, and I was still sad about  it. After the sober opening by Tim Meadows, however, I started laughing  pretty much non-stop till it was over. His better-known routines are on  here, such as Bennet Brower, Matt Foley, and the Chippendale's dancer,  which are all hilarious. But there's also quite a few skits that I never  saw, and we watched pretty much every week when he was in the cast. My only  complaint is that it isn't longer, and some funny skits, they only show  snippets of, like him playing Alan Hale, and the skit with Sandler where  Michael Keaton was the host and Sandler plays his cranky grandmother whom  he has to watch for 20 minutes. (if you want to see the whole skit, which  is one of the funniest things I've ever seen them do, then buy the Best of  Adam Sandler as well, because it the whole skit, plus some other great  Farley stuff not on this tape is on there). The only noticeable (if you're  a Farley fan) omission is a skit called &quot;The Relapse Guy&quot; where  he plays a guy who goes to rehab then gets wasted again over and over (it's  way funnier than it sounds, trust me). I think they thought it was a little  too close to home (though they did leave in the Ditka stuff with him faking  a heart attack-that kind of made me wince).  Every time I see this, several  things happen-- I get sad that he wasn't around long enough to make more  movies with Spade, or even by himself, because (this sounds corny) he had  so much to give. I also get pi$$ed off at him for not taking better care of  himself and dying. I also usually laugh so hard I fall off the couch. No  matter how bad of a day I had, I can watch almost any of the skits on here  and get cheered up instantly. He was a guy who could just say one line that  you would think no-one could say and make it funny, and make you fall down  laughing just the way he says it. His costars really had a hard time  keeping character, which shows even more in the dress rehersal 'blooper'  clips they show. Watch David Spade and Christina Appelgate during the Matt  FOley thing- they both have to turn away from the camera to hide their  faces because they can't keep a straight face, and when he starts in with  the &quot;I bet you're asking yourself 'hey Matt, how do we get back on the  right track?' &quot; you can see their shoulders shaking they are laughing  so hard. Sandler can't keep a straight face when he's doing the  &quot;Lunchlady&quot; song with him, either. Come to think of it, I have no  clue how anyone on stage with him could ever keep a straight face. If you  were bummed out when he died, get ready to get teary (though you'll already  have tears running down your face from laughing) when he sings, &quot;so  long, farewell&quot; as Matt Foley at the end, sitting on Phil Hartman's  lap (I could watch this without tearing up until Hartman was killed, now I  can't see the clip without getting choked up). But even if you do get  emotional, keep watching, because after the credits they stick on the one  thing I'd been hoping for the whole time-a quick clip of Farley as  &quot;Sandman&quot; on &quot;Nat X&quot;. What a waste- I hope whereever he  is he knows how happy he made people during the short time he was around  (and how happy he is still making those of us who thought he was funny).",5,I miss this big guy...,959904000,"06 2, 2000",2000,3645,"[""'ve"", 'found', 'most', 'people', 'totally', 'love', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'when', 'bring', 'up', 'make', 'face', 'say', 'quot', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'funny.', 'quot', 'are', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'video', 'yet', 'RUN', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'shopping', 'cart', 'buy', 'one', 'When', 'ran', 'first', 'time', 'TV', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'Farley', 'death', 'was', 'still', 'sad', 'sober', 'opening', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'however', 'started', 'laughing', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-stop', 'till', 'was', 'over', 'better-known', 'routines', 'are', 'here', 'such', 'Bennet', 'Brower', 'Matt', 'Foley', 'Chippendale', 'dancer', 'are', 'hilarious', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'skits', 'never', 'saw', 'watched', 'pretty', 'much', 'week', 'when', 'was', 'cast', 'only', 'complaint', ""n't"", 'longer', 'funny', 'skits', 'only', 'show', 'snippets', 'playing', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'skit', 'Sandler', 'where', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'was', 'host', 'Sandler', 'cranky', 'grandmother', 'whom', 'watch', '20', 'minutes', 'want', 'see', 'whole', 'skit', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'then', 'buy', 'Best', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'well', 'whole', 'skit', 'other', 'great', 'Farley', 'stuff', 'not', 'tape', 'only', 'noticeable', ""'re"", 'Farley', 'fan', 'omission', 'skit', 'called', 'quot', 'Relapse', 'Guy', 'quot', 'where', 'guy', 'who', 'rehab', 'then', 'wasted', 'again', 'way', 'funnier', 'trust', 'think', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'did', 'leave', 'Ditka', 'stuff', 'faking', 'heart', 'attack-that', 'kind', 'made', 'wince', 'Every', 'time', 'see', 'several', 'things', 'happen', 'get', 'sad', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'more', 'movies', 'Spade', 'even', 'corny', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'give', 'also', 'get', 'pi', 'ed', 'off', 'not', 'taking', 'better', 'care', 'dying', 'also', 'usually', 'so', 'hard', 'fall', 'couch', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'day', 'had', 'can', 'watch', 'almost', 'skits', 'here', 'get', 'cheered', 'up', 'instantly', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'could', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'line', 'would', 'think', 'no-one', 'could', 'say', 'make', 'funny', 'make', 'fall', 'down', 'laughing', 'just', 'way', 'costars', 'really', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'dress', 'rehersal', ""'blooper"", 'clips', 'show', 'Watch', 'David', 'Spade', 'Christina', 'Appelgate', 'Matt', 'FOley', 'thing-', 'have', 'turn', 'away', 'camera', 'hide', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'when', 'quot', 'bet', ""'re"", 'asking', ""'hey"", 'Matt', 'how', 'do', 'get', 'back', 'right', 'track', 'quot', 'can', 'see', 'shoulders', 'shaking', 'are', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'Sandler', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'when', 'doing', 'quot', 'Lunchlady', 'quot', 'song', 'either', 'Come', 'think', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'anyone', 'stage', 'could', 'ever', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'were', 'bummed', 'out', 'when', 'died', 'get', 'ready', 'get', 'teary', ""'ll"", 'already', 'have', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'face', 'laughing', 'when', 'quot', 'so', 'long', 'farewell', 'quot', 'Matt', 'Foley', 'end', 'sitting', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'lap', 'could', 'watch', 'tearing', 'up', 'Hartman', 'was', 'killed', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'clip', 'getting', 'choked', 'up', 'even', 'do', 'get', 'emotional', 'keep', 'watching', 'credits', 'stick', 'one', 'thing', ""'d"", 'been', 'hoping', 'whole', 'time-a', 'quick', 'clip', 'Farley', 'quot', 'Sandman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Nat', 'X', 'quot', 'What', 'waste-', 'hope', 'how', 'happy', 'made', 'people', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'around', 'how', 'happy', 'still', 'making', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'funny']",Saturday Night Live - The Best of Chris Farley VHS
