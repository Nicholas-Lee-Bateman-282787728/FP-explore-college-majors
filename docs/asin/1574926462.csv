Gearino's debut novel was turned into a Hallmark Hall of Fame telemovie a few years back, and I finally got round to watching it. I'm a big fan of Gearino's, and it's possible I was avoiding it simply because I didn't know whether someone adapting it for film-- especially something made for television-- would do it the justice it deserved. What the Deaf Man Heard, though, is a delight.Sammy Ayers (Matthew Modine, as a grown-up), as we open, is fleeing with his mother from her old life. We find out pretty quickly this is standard operating procedure, but something goes wrong this time-- at a layover, his mother is abducted and murdered, leaving Sammy asleep on the bus. When they get to the end of the line, Sammy (Frankie Muniz, as a kid) is understandably concerned with his current situation, and decides the best approach is to play deaf-mute, even after being taken in by a kindly storeowner (Tom Skerritt) and his wife. As he gets older, it becomes harder to reveal his secret, so he goes through life pretending. Itinerant junk dealer Archibald Thacker (James Earl Jones) suspects there's more to Sammy than meets the eye, however...It's a fun little movie-- nothing special, nothing great, but well-adapted and competently acted by a surprisingly high-powered cast who do the material justice.

Sammy was traveling with his mother (Bernadette Peters) when she suddenly disappeared, leaving him alone and frightened. Her last words to him were, ""Not a word,"" and Sammy takes this as Gospel, refusing to utter a single syllable to the townsfolk who try to help him. Naturally, they think that he is a deaf-mute, and bachelor bus depot owner Norm Jenkins (Tom Skerritt) takes him in.As Sammy grows into adulthood, he does simple odd jobs around the community. People are kind to him, yet treat him as invisible due to his ""deafness"" and speak openly about town gossip and family secrets. Sammy becomes caught up in the illegal dealings and ""holier than thou"" posturing of the oily Tolliver Tynan (Jake Weber), and at the same time is attracted to Tolliver's sister Tallassee (Anne Bobby). There is also a subplot involving Archibald Thacker (James Earl Jones) and his sons, who are producing moonshine, and Sammy feels that he has to step in before things get out of hand.This is a charming film about family above all, and the many seasoned actors (Modine, Skerritt, Jones, Peters) turn in memorable performances.
