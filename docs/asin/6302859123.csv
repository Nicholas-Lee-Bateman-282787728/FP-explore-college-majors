340873,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6302859123,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 8]","After watching this movie, I had to do some research on it.  I had learned that this was a true story, but I didn't know anything about what it may be about or who the major players were.  What I did discover was that this film was somewhat factually wrong.  I hated to read that because this was a very powerful film. This was one of the only films that I have ever watched that used less ""known"" words, and more violence to carry the message.  Perhaps violence isn't the best word, but this film was filled with violent images countered with images of faith and healing.  Apparently when Vaca returned to Spain, he wrote some letters to the King describing what he had seen during the eight years on the uncharted land. This was the basis for this film, but according to most, this film left out too much, and took rights to other parts of Vaca's adventure. For example, although the long sequence early in the movie showing Cabeza de Vaca's period of slavery to the Indian sorcerer and the armless dwarf is quite interesting to see, there is no corresponding incident in the explorer's writings. Vaca did report on a brief period of enslavement, but that is all. No sorcerer, no dwarf (...damn...).This film is a transitional movie.  At first, we are to feel sorry for Vaca and what is happening to him. Watching the dwarf and sorcerer make fun of him and force him to do painful duties.  We are made to feel sympathetic for this man that seemingly is loosing strength and mental power daily.  Then, we hit the big moment.  When Vaca becomes the healer and befriends the Indian, we feel less sympathetic, and for me, more confused.  Did Vaca want to leave this place?  Near the end, the answer becomes even more shaded.  I would think that someone that feels so strongly about a community that he has spent eight years of his life with would do more than just go back and hope that his new ""family"" is not captured.  Vaca, in this film, took the cheap route.  The final scene is a very gripping moment in our history.  Vaca is forced to help bring Christianity to this natives.  To demolish their world and form of religion and bring in Western civilization. Vaca sees this and cries, but then STILL does nothing.  He apparently has the power to bring people to life, but destroy a church is well out of his grasp.The last scene is of enslaved Indians carrying a Christian cross across the desert. This represent the beginning of the end of most of the Indian's beliefs that have been them for thousands of years.  The beginning of the corruption and the force to bring certain beliefs to everyone. Very sad ending.Overall, a decent film that still carries a strong message even today.  While the cinematography seems choppy at times, it is worth the wait to witness the human destruction near the end.  I suggest this to anyone that needs a moment to see the path of ""our"" people.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Sorcerers and dwarfs in Mexico,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2907,"['watching', 'movie', 'had', 'do', 'research', 'had', 'learned', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'who', 'major', 'players', 'were', 'What', 'did', 'discover', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'factually', 'wrong', 'hated', 'read', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'used', 'less', 'known', 'words', 'more', 'violence', 'carry', 'message', 'Perhaps', 'violence', ""n't"", 'best', 'word', 'film', 'was', 'filled', 'violent', 'images', 'countered', 'images', 'faith', 'healing', 'Apparently', 'when', 'Vaca', 'returned', 'Spain', 'wrote', 'letters', 'King', 'describing', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'eight', 'years', 'uncharted', 'land', 'was', 'basis', 'film', 'according', 'most', 'film', 'left', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'took', 'rights', 'other', 'parts', 'Vaca', 'adventure', 'example', 'long', 'sequence', 'early', 'movie', 'showing', 'Cabeza', 'Vaca', 'period', 'slavery', 'Indian', 'sorcerer', 'armless', 'dwarf', 'quite', 'interesting', 'see', 'corresponding', 'incident', 'explorer', 'writings', 'Vaca', 'did', 'report', 'brief', 'period', 'enslavement', 'sorcerer', 'dwarf', 'damn', '.This', 'film', 'transitional', 'movie', 'first', 'are', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Vaca', 'what', 'happening', 'Watching', 'dwarf', 'sorcerer', 'make', 'fun', 'force', 'do', 'painful', 'duties', 'are', 'made', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'man', 'seemingly', 'loosing', 'strength', 'mental', 'power', 'daily', 'Then', 'hit', 'big', 'moment', 'When', 'Vaca', 'healer', 'Indian', 'feel', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'more', 'confused', 'Did', 'Vaca', 'want', 'leave', 'place', 'end', 'answer', 'even', 'more', 'shaded', 'would', 'think', 'someone', 'so', 'strongly', 'community', 'spent', 'eight', 'years', 'life', 'would', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'go', 'back', 'hope', 'new', 'family', 'not', 'captured', 'Vaca', 'film', 'took', 'cheap', 'route', 'final', 'scene', 'very', 'gripping', 'moment', 'history', 'Vaca', 'forced', 'help', 'bring', 'Christianity', 'natives', 'demolish', 'world', 'form', 'religion', 'bring', 'Western', 'civilization', 'Vaca', 'cries', 'then', 'STILL', 'nothing', 'apparently', 'power', 'bring', 'people', 'life', 'church', 'well', 'grasp.The', 'last', 'scene', 'enslaved', 'Indians', 'carrying', 'Christian', 'cross', 'desert', 'represent', 'beginning', 'end', 'most', 'Indian', 'beliefs', 'have', 'been', 'thousands', 'years', 'beginning', 'corruption', 'force', 'bring', 'certain', 'beliefs', 'everyone', 'Very', 'sad', 'ending.Overall', 'decent', 'film', 'still', 'strong', 'message', 'even', 'today', 'cinematography', 'choppy', 'times', 'wait', 'witness', 'human', 'destruction', 'end', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'moment', 'see', 'path', 'people.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A

That, and the fact that he posted two one-star reviews to bring the totals down for an international award winning film. I've read de Vaca's account, and it is indeed a great tale, which is why I was so looking forward to this movie's measuring up to the original narrative. I was not disppointed in the slightest, although naturally the movie doesn't portray all the passages from the account.It's evident from every frame of this film that the filmmakers invested a great deal of love, energy and artistry to their task. Director Echevarria gets the utmost out of his outstanding cast. The Spaniards and the Native Americans are entirely believable, and the film depicts one of the most authentic representaions of Native American cultures I've seen on screen. The only film that comes close is Last of the Mohicans. It's definitely a case of the good, the bad and the ugly. The clash of cultures couldn't be represented any better.Juan Diego as de Vaca is a revelation. He should have been up for an Oscar for his performance. The dwarfish villager who first vividly menaces and later befriends de Vaca has to be one of the most memorable characters in recent cinema. The same can be said for the village Shaman, also an exceptional performance.From the credits, it is evident that the Mexican Government had a hand in funding the filming of this movie. It is well that they should have, as this has to be something of a national treasure.Definitely disregard any negative comments about Cabeza de Vaca. It's a great film about an amazing man, whose courage and fortitude may have been unmatched in the annals of European exploreration of the New World. This is decidedly a must-see.BEK",5,Captures the Essence of the Account,1053302400,"05 19, 2003",2003,1864,"['do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'address', 'other', 'reviewers', 'reviews', 'instance', 'believe', 'reviewer', 'Arizona', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'be', 'totally', 'base', 'fact', 'posted', 'two', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'bring', 'totals', 'down', 'international', 'award', 'winning', 'film', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Vaca', 'account', 'indeed', 'great', 'tale', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'measuring', 'up', 'original', 'narrative', 'was', 'not', 'disppointed', 'slightest', 'naturally', 'movie', ""n't"", 'portray', 'passages', 'account.It', 'evident', 'frame', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'invested', 'great', 'deal', 'love', 'energy', 'artistry', 'task', 'Director', 'Echevarria', 'utmost', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Spaniards', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'entirely', 'believable', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'authentic', 'representaions', 'Native', 'American', 'cultures', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'only', 'film', 'close', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'definitely', 'case', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'clash', 'cultures', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'represented', 'better.Juan', 'Diego', 'de', 'Vaca', 'revelation', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'dwarfish', 'villager', 'who', 'first', 'vividly', 'menaces', 'later', 'befriends', 'de', 'Vaca', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'recent', 'cinema', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'village', 'Shaman', 'also', 'exceptional', 'performance.From', 'credits', 'evident', 'Mexican', 'Government', 'had', 'hand', 'funding', 'filming', 'movie', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'be', 'something', 'national', 'treasure.Definitely', 'disregard', 'negative', 'comments', 'Cabeza', 'de', 'Vaca', 'great', 'film', 'amazing', 'man', 'courage', 'fortitude', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'unmatched', 'annals', 'European', 'exploreration', 'New', 'World', 'decidedly', 'must-see.BEK']",N/A

In places simple, moving statements would have helped clear up a rather mysterious but highly evocative film.  The subtitles were not altogether accurate translations of the Castilian Spanish spoken by the actors, but they kept one fairly well apprised.After I watched it I got to wondering about who Cabeza de Vaca really was.  The film portrays him as a conquistador-turned-healer.  The church--which even now pushes to make Junipero Serra, religious conquerer of California, a saint, having learned nothing about the damage done by the colonizer mentality--considers him a great patron of Christianizing the heathen Natives.  Some of the advocates of Native rights, voice, and history condemn him as a well-intentioned point man for the subsequent Spanish, and then Anglo, waves of conquest surging into Norteamerica.Whomever he was (and do e-mail me if you know much about him, because I'm curious), I like to think that the Seven Cities of Gold were metaphysical experiences not to be taken so literally.

It places you inside the eyes of early Spaniards landing in the Americas- how they see the land and People, having only their life in a European context to relate. The viewer is drawn in by their fears and superstitions, the mystery of these unexplored places, and the clashes of cultures and difficulties of understanding. I saw a subtle message comparing the indigenous societies and shamans who were in sync with their surroundings, to the Catholicism of the time which seemed to be about fear, demons, and not part of the natural world(and did not save their lives either). Some scenes reminded me of Hieronymous Bosch paintings-as though the Spaniards thought they had decended into a Hell.This is not at all like a Hollywood Native American movie.I have read some first hand explorer accounts from these early times and was entranced by how the director of this movie placed us there in the heart of this ""strangeness""- how the Spaniards interpreted what they were experiencing.
