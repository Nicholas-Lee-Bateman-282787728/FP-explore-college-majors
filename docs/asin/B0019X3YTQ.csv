It brings up many moral and  ethical issues that might arise with psychological disorders and traumas. Olivia Thirlby is brilliant and extremely effective in her first role in this film. David Duchovny has a few great moments and in the beginning of the film looks so young, it makes one reminisce the first years of The X-Files.

So, realistically something weird could happen but this movie shows that the key to understanding this ""delicate"" situation is to just be patient, wait, and don't have anymore traumas and everything just may straighten itself out just as it did in this movie and that I like very much about this movie.  It was realized sensibly eventually that a choice had to be made and the choice to live both personas (both presence of minds/consciousness) as a natural course and let the mind figure out how things will go...well, I liked that part.I can see why some peope had a problem with David Duchovny's performance; it was actually unnerving to me at times.  Is it realitic for a guy to be so horny when his daughter is so ill? Okay, I'll grant the script its take on this situation. Mourning comes in stages and it is very difficult for a husband who loses a wife he loves but the script should have been written to show him in mourning stages but then I grant the script what it did suppose that the husband did go into mourning for his wife once his daughter was fixed in her mind.  So okay.  I think that might have been a normal course for some guys but not for others.  Some fathers would have taken their daughter to their sister's or grandmother or aunt, some female in the family and that would have been it.  He would have entered his mourning stages even though his wife's ""mind"" was in his daughter's body.  But this way is a possible way to do it so that everybody ends up SLOWLY growing into the new reality to avoid more shock and trauma.  The point is: the body often heals itself, including the mind.But I did have a problem with a mom who could stop herself from using drugs like the daughter and having sex with her boyfriends but she couldn't stop her self from wanting to have sex with her daughter's father.  That was out of place with the mom we were shown.  But then, again, I guess I have to allow the script to allow everybody to get use to the new reality.  But as I think about it: I still have a problem with that aspect. because the mind of a mother can have a desire for a young fellow her daughter brings home but her mother self forces her to control her lust.  And, we were shown a mother who was shown to be in control of herself for the sake of her daughter.I agree. This was an interesting movie.

As a matter of disclosure I'll point out that I am not a remake basher, on principle, at all.The basic story centers on a seventeen year old girl whose body is inhabited by her mother's soul. The two of them were in a terrible accident, and while in the hospital, just as the mother is about to die she reaches over, all ceiling of the Sistine Chapel like, and transfers her soul into the body of her daughter. The daughter keeps her body but becomes her mother in personality and memories. When she goes to school and hangs out with her friends she doesn't really know what's going on, who the people are or what her homework assignments are, because ... well, she's her mother now, for all practical purposes. It takes her a while to come to terms with what's happened and even longer to convince her father/husband.Now, to cut right to the chase in case you can't see the 400 pound gorilla in the room, once the father is convinced that his wife is living in the body of his daughter and they, well, ya know, they're all in love and stuff ... so what about sex?Things get a little creepy but I give both films high marks for how delicately the sex question is handled. I'll leave it at that and say it's not the main theme of either film, just one of many issues that come up.The English version is loud and antagonistic. It's not a horror movie (not sure how it got marketed as such) unless you consider David Duchovny spooning with a seventeen year old girl to be horror. The daughter is in rebellion mode against the mother before the accident and their relationship takes center stage--the mother discovering her daughter's world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll while the daughter comes to recognize the love that her mother has always had for her. The Japanese version is much quieter in comparison. The mother and daughter love each other very much and the antagonism angle focuses on the husband/wife relationship. The husband becomes sad and wimpy, feeling oppressed by having his wife around only as a roadblock to his moving on. The diet of sadness is served in small introspective doses, though, and changes how the film resolves. In the English version the resolution occurs between the mother and daughter. In the Japanese version it is between the husband and wife and involves a big twist that should serve to remind viewers that this has been a fantasy film, after all. As mentioned, I saw the English remake first and it didn't do the twist, and when I watched the original (with the twist) I thought to myself ""This is why I like Asian cinema."" It is so Japanese. Just when the limits of despair seem to have been reached, another complex layer of sadness is revealed for your weeping pleasure. (I wonder how the book they're both based upon ends.)I'm not a remake basher but I think if I had seen the Japanese version first I might have railed against the remake for changing focus and tone. Having seen the English version first allowed me to enjoy it for what it was, and it didn't in any way impinge upon my enjoyment of the original. I recommend both films but suggest, oddly, seeing the remake first. Both films explore, and handle, the creepy dilemma of ""Would you have sex with your wife if she was living in your daughter's body?"" quite well. They're both sweet and touching ... except for some of the touching.",4,Different from the original but good in its own way,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,3761,"['saw', '2007', 'French/American', 'version', 'film', 'first', 'knowing', 'was', 'remake', 'liked', 'especially', 'performance', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'when', 'discovered', '1999', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Himitsu', 'liked', 'even', 'more', 'highlighted', 'little', 'why', 'Japanese', 'films', 'particular', 'East', 'Asian', 'films', 'general', 'lot', 'sweeter', 'more', 'subtle', 'More', 'sad', 'too', 'wider', 'emotional', 'net', 'matter', 'disclosure', ""'ll"", 'point', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'remake', 'basher', 'principle', 'all.The', 'basic', 'story', 'centers', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'body', 'inhabited', 'mother', 'soul', 'two', 'were', 'terrible', 'accident', 'hospital', 'just', 'mother', 'die', 'ceiling', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'transfers', 'soul', 'body', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'body', 'mother', 'personality', 'memories', 'When', 'school', 'hangs', 'out', 'friends', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'what', 'homework', 'assignments', 'are', 'well', 'mother', 'now', 'practical', 'purposes', 'while', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'longer', 'convince', 'father/husband.Now', 'cut', 'right', 'chase', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', '400', 'pound', 'gorilla', 'room', 'once', 'father', 'convinced', 'wife', 'living', 'body', 'daughter', 'well', 'know', ""'re"", 'love', 'stuff', 'so', 'what', 'sex', 'Things', 'get', 'little', 'creepy', 'give', 'films', 'high', 'marks', 'how', 'delicately', 'sex', 'question', 'handled', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'say', 'not', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'issues', 'come', 'up.The', 'English', 'version', 'loud', 'antagonistic', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'got', 'marketed', 'such', 'consider', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'spooning', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'be', 'horror', 'daughter', 'rebellion', 'mode', 'mother', 'accident', 'relationship', 'center', 'stage', 'mother', 'discovering', 'daughter', 'world', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'daughter', 'recognize', 'love', 'mother', 'always', 'had', 'Japanese', 'version', 'much', 'quieter', 'comparison', 'mother', 'daughter', 'love', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'antagonism', 'angle', 'husband/wife', 'relationship', 'husband', 'sad', 'wimpy', 'feeling', 'oppressed', 'having', 'wife', 'around', 'only', 'roadblock', 'moving', 'diet', 'sadness', 'served', 'small', 'introspective', 'doses', 'how', 'film', 'resolves', 'English', 'version', 'resolution', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Japanese', 'version', 'husband', 'wife', 'big', 'twist', 'should', 'serve', 'remind', 'viewers', 'been', 'fantasy', 'film', 'mentioned', 'saw', 'English', 'remake', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'twist', 'when', 'watched', 'original', 'twist', 'thought', 'myself', 'why', 'like', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'so', 'Japanese', 'Just', 'when', 'limits', 'despair', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'reached', 'complex', 'layer', 'sadness', 'revealed', 'weeping', 'pleasure', 'wonder', 'how', 'book', ""'re"", 'based', 'ends', ""'m"", 'not', 'remake', 'basher', 'think', 'had', 'seen', 'Japanese', 'version', 'first', 'might', 'have', 'railed', 'remake', 'changing', 'focus', 'tone', 'Having', 'seen', 'English', 'version', 'first', 'allowed', 'enjoy', 'what', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'impinge', 'enjoyment', 'original', 'recommend', 'films', 'suggest', 'oddly', 'seeing', 'remake', 'first', 'films', 'explore', 'handle', 'creepy', 'dilemma', 'Would', 'have', 'sex', 'wife', 'was', 'living', 'daughter', 'body', 'quite', 'well', ""'re"", 'sweet', 'touching', 'touching']",The Secret

The performances were very adequate and make for a sustainable take on the body/spirit switch. The lead up to the event with their lovey-dovey marriage was over the top sap, but still fun. Through the course of the film, the young actress does a great job of fulfilling a split personality type roll, and I look forward to seeing more from her. By the end of the film you forget who is really there and who is not (in her mind).SPOILER: I will get to the obvious question as numerous people have said they will not rent it if it goes down a certain path of consumation; It does not. But that does not mean you won't feel uncomfortable at times. For what this film is, I gave it a higher rating because of the believability without going X-Files-ish in how/why it happens, plus the acting was solid.Quality of the DVD was fine, (did not get to the Blu this week) but it still showed a variety of failings with the camera grain; there were several takes of back/forth dialogue scenes that were obviously shot by different cameras where the grain detracted from the scene.

1164826,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0019X3YTQ,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 3]","""The Secret"" (2007) is a family drama with a twist, about a middle-aged family man, Dr. Benjamin Marris (David Duchovny), who has recently lost his wife Hannah (Lili Taylor) in a car accident. Their only daughter Samantha (Olivia Thirlby) survives, but when Sam regains her consciousness in hospital, she claims that she is Hannah trapped in her daughter's body.At first Ben is skeptical, thinking this is only Sam's delusion, but things get unexpectedly complicated when he realized another possibility: what if Hannah, Ben's wife, is really inside Sam, his daughter? How should they (I mean, Hannah and Ben) live from now on?With more effective elaboration on the theme of social mores or taboos, ""The Secret"" would have been a first-rate psychological mystery/romance. Unfortunately, what we get here is an intriguing subject matter ruined by clich&eacute;d characters (including Sam's cardboard teenage friends), weak acting from the stars and heavy-handed narrative. Even those who are impressed with the film's unique set-up would think there might be a better way to explore it more effectively.Actually, there is. Co-produced by Luc Besson, ""The Secret"" is an English-speaking remake of ""Himitsu"" (meaning ""secret""), 1999 Japanese film starring Ry'ko Hirosue (""Wasabi"" opposite Jean Reno). Y'jir' Takita, responsible for Oscar-winning drama ""Departures"" (also starring Hirosue), directed the film adapted from the novel ""Himitsu"" by Keigo Higashino. The original movie was not as great as ""Departures,"" but it still made a point with sly humor, pointed satire, and most importantly, a different (and astonishing) ending that has something to do with the ""secret.""Swiss-born director Vincent P&eacute;rez, better known for his works as an actor (""Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train"" ""Swept from the Sea""), has completely changed the meaning of ""The Secret."" Now in the remake it is about the dysfunctional relationship between a parent and a child. This is ""Freaky Friday"" without humor, definitely not a big secret we would be interested. (If you want to know what the ""secret"" really is, read the original novel, translated in English as ""Naoko"" published by Vertical. All I can say is that they took out the most interesting, and perhaps shocking, part of the story. What remains does not make much sense.)I tried to enjoy ""The Secret"" as what it is. But ""The Secret"" does not know what it wants to be. The film is neither good nor bad.

1164828,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0019X3YTQ,Z Hayes,"[42, 45]","""The Secret"" stars David Duchovny as Ben Marris, a successful ophtalmologist who is happily married to Hannah [Lili Taylor of The Haunting]who is a housewife. They have a rebellious 16-year-old daughter Sam [Olivia Thirlby]and from the beginning we can see the antagonism Sam feels towards her over-protective mother. Both mom and daughter head out on a weekend trip and an accident causes both to be critically wounded, eventually resulting in a bizarre occurence in which Hannah's spirit transfers over to Sam's body whilst Sam's spirit lingers somewhere in limbo-land.The rest of the movie deals with how Ben comes to grips with this bizarre turn of events and how Hannah struggles to cope not only with having lost her material body, but having to try to 'find' her daughter's spirit within Sam's physical self, whislt at the same time traversing the tension-fraught life of a high school teen. Both Ben and ""Hannah as Sam"" also have trouble dealing with the weirdness of their situation as being deeply in love, they come to certain realisations about the impossible situation they are both in. Ben is torn between wanting to satisfy his and Hannah's emotional and sexual needs whilst not wanting to cross the boundaries presented by his own daughter's material body.The leads do a credible job of portraying three individuals trapped in an intolerable situation, though it is Duchovny's Ben and Thirlby's Sam that carry the movie for the most part. Olivia Thirlby's performance as Samantha/Hannah is commendable as she portrays both mother and teen credibly. Viewers can really tell when she is playing either mother or daughter. Thirlby is definitely a young actor of promising talent based on this performance.This is supposedly a remake of a Japanese movie titled Himitsu, and though I haven't watched the original, this movie can stand alone on its own merits. Though it has a supernatural premise, it never really delves too deeply into that aspect for the movie deals more with how individuals cope under strange circumstances. Ben and 'Hannah' do seem to accept the situation way too quickly [which did strike me as very odd], but at 1.5 hrs long, the movie really didn't have the luxury of time to go in depth into the topic of spirit transference/possession.On the whole, I found ""The Secret"" to be quite an engrossing drama and well carried by credible acting.SPOILER ALERTFor those viewers who are very much concerned about the taboo aspects of this movie, i.e. a dad having to deal with a daughter who has her mother's spirit residing within her and the physical issues of dealing with that, do not fret. The movie never crosses the line towards actual physical consummation nor any explicit displays of affection between Ben and ""Hannah as Sam"".",3,Engrossing drama dealing with spirit transference,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,2764,"['Secret', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Ben', 'Marris', 'successful', 'ophtalmologist', 'who', 'happily', 'married', 'Hannah', '[', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Haunting', ']', 'who', 'housewife', 'have', 'rebellious', '16-year-old', 'daughter', 'Sam', '[', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', ']', 'beginning', 'can', 'see', 'antagonism', 'Sam', 'over-protective', 'mother', 'mom', 'daughter', 'head', 'out', 'weekend', 'trip', 'accident', 'be', 'critically', 'wounded', 'eventually', 'resulting', 'bizarre', 'occurence', 'Hannah', 'spirit', 'transfers', 'Sam', 'body', 'whilst', 'Sam', 'spirit', 'lingers', 'somewhere', 'limbo-land.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'how', 'Ben', 'grips', 'bizarre', 'turn', 'events', 'how', 'Hannah', 'cope', 'not', 'only', 'having', 'lost', 'material', 'body', 'having', 'try', ""'find"", 'daughter', 'spirit', 'Sam', 'physical', 'self', 'whislt', 'same', 'time', 'traversing', 'tension-fraught', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'teen', 'Ben', 'Hannah', 'Sam', 'also', 'have', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'weirdness', 'situation', 'being', 'deeply', 'love', 'come', 'certain', 'realisations', 'impossible', 'situation', 'are', 'Ben', 'torn', 'wanting', 'satisfy', 'Hannah', 'emotional', 'sexual', 'needs', 'whilst', 'not', 'wanting', 'cross', 'boundaries', 'presented', 'own', 'daughter', 'material', 'body.The', 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'portraying', 'three', 'individuals', 'trapped', 'intolerable', 'situation', 'Duchovny', 'Ben', 'Thirlby', 'Sam', 'carry', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'performance', 'Samantha/Hannah', 'commendable', 'mother', 'teen', 'credibly', 'Viewers', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'when', 'playing', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Thirlby', 'definitely', 'young', 'actor', 'promising', 'talent', 'based', 'performance.This', 'supposedly', 'remake', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'titled', 'Himitsu', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'original', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'own', 'merits', 'supernatural', 'premise', 'never', 'really', 'too', 'deeply', 'aspect', 'movie', 'more', 'how', 'individuals', 'cope', 'strange', 'circumstances', 'Ben', ""'Hannah"", 'do', 'seem', 'accept', 'situation', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', '[', 'did', 'strike', 'very', 'odd', ']', '1.5', 'hrs', 'long', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'luxury', 'time', 'go', 'depth', 'topic', 'spirit', 'whole', 'found', 'Secret', 'be', 'quite', 'engrossing', 'drama', 'well', 'carried', 'credible', 'acting.SPOILER', 'ALERTFor', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'concerned', 'taboo', 'aspects', 'movie', 'i.e', 'dad', 'having', 'deal', 'daughter', 'who', 'mother', 'spirit', 'residing', 'physical', 'issues', 'dealing', 'do', 'not', 'fret', 'movie', 'never', 'line', 'actual', 'physical', 'consummation', 'explicit', 'displays', 'affection', 'Ben', 'Hannah', 'Sam']",The Secret
