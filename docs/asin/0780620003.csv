However to this day, I think Spawn could have benefited from an R rating and more emphasis could have been placed on the action sequences(which were exciting but there should have been more).I would have thought that a sequel would come out in the years after but didn't.A sharp contrary when compared to Blade,which came out exactly 1 year after Spawn,and became a trilogy in no time at all.Even the actors and the acting(most importantly)held up-meaning it may have been a bit cartoonish, but never dumb and/or stupid.Lastly,it felt good to see for the first time an African-American superhero on the screen.P.S. the effects were great and the soundtrack(a mix of rock and electronica laced tracks)is a bonus if you liked the movie.",3,Spawn97ok,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,1134,"['Initially', 'back', 'when', 'Spawn', 'came', 'out', 'theatres', 'i', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'let', 'alone', 'read', 'single', 'comic', 'book', 'source', 'material.But', 'nevertheless', 'i', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'comic', 'book-based', 'film', 'other', 'Batman', 'hit', 'screens.Sadly', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'august', '1997', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'still.When', 'finally', 'did', 'couple', 'months', 'later', 'VHS', 'was', 'not', 'dissapointed', 'However', 'day', 'think', 'Spawn', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'R', 'rating', 'more', 'emphasis', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'exciting', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', '.I', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'sequel', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'years', ""didn't.A"", 'sharp', 'contrary', 'when', 'compared', 'Blade', 'came', 'out', 'exactly', '1', 'year', 'Spawn', 'became', 'trilogy', 'time', 'all.Even', 'actors', 'acting', 'most', 'importantly', 'held', 'up-meaning', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'cartoonish', 'never', 'dumb', 'and/or', 'stupid.Lastly', 'felt', 'good', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'African-American', 'superhero', 'screen.P.S', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'mix', 'rock', 'electronica', 'laced', 'tracks', 'bonus', 'liked', 'movie']",N/A
29845,A24B06IPXG2BL8,0780620003,"""aldahia905""","[3, 4]","While most would agree that &quot;Spawn&quot; had potential but never truly amounted to anything much...I would have to disagree.  When the film first found its way into theaters in 1997, most critics gave this flick 7 out of 10 stars.  It really wasn't as dreadful as I had anticipated.  To begin with, Spawn is a wonderful, exciting creation, created by Canada's own: Todd McFarland.The story of &quot;Spawn&quot; centres around Al Simmons, the highest-trained assasin for the CIA, the coldest of cold-blooded killers whose sole mission is to serve his country.  When his superior betrays him, in exchange for a Heat-16 device, that when triggered will blow the world to oblivion, in order to dominate the world, his soul is sent directly to Hell where he is told in order to regain whatever is left of his humanity, his identity and his wife, he must lead Satan's army in the bid to kick-start the Apocalypse.  Satan's lieutenant, his right-hand &quot;clown&quot;, fuels his anger in a bid to direct it toward Jason Wynn, in an attempt to have him killed setting off the Heat-16 device, starting the Apocalypse.  Wynn is told Spawn is a supernatural creature that must be stopped so he can take control of the world and gain all its riches, not letting him get in the way.Satan's bid is to pit one against the other, so His plans to created the Eden of Armageddon on Earth.  Spawn is left with the choice of having to fight his inner demons and use his supernatural abilities to overcome whatever evil has begot him.  The central point that needs to be emphasized is that Spawn is a character who has to find a way to save the world, regain his life, without &quot;selling-out&quot; by doing Satan's bidding.  By letting his anger &quot;get to&quot; him, Satan can only use that against him, never fulfilling His promise of having him returned to his wife and a normal human life.  He must find a way of destroying the Heat-16 device, without destroying humanity, therefore not causing Armageddon.  He must channel his thoughts and actions into positivity, where he can focus using his abilities to better humanity without causing too much damage and teach Satan a most valuable lesson: He must do his own &quot;dirty&quot; work himself if he cares that much to kick-start the Apocalypse!  Satan is the ultimate coward in this film.  Spawn is the true winner because he has lost a seemingly &quot;normal&quot; life, must rebuild from the beginning to find his identity and his true meaning in life, all the while fighting Satan and his lieutenant, accept that the woman he loves can no longer be with him and still try to find peace within himself.Unlike, Superman, Spiderman or Batman...Spawn is not &quot;clean-cut&quot; nor &quot;pure&quot;.  He is flawed, he has much learning to do, the creator, as he claimed in the DVD Special Features, did great justice and exemplified true fairness in creating a superhero that did not confine to the stereotype of what superheroes should look or be like.  He was not a rich man who owns millions of dollars and owns most if not all of a city (Batman) from whom we can all get something...He does not come from another planet (Superman) who is seemingly human except for the fact he has powers...and He was not bitten by a Spider and given magical spider abilities.  Spawn/Al Simmons was a just a man working, serving his wife, living life day-by-day, believing he was doing right and trying to make the best of the torment he gained as a result of killing in the name of &quot;good&quot;.Spawn teaches us and shows us that even killing in the name of &quot;good&quot; draws you toward the &quot;dark&quot; side and that we must, all at some point in our lives, find ways of not succumbing to it.  This character has so much depth, and inner torment, and it's this flaw that makes him so exhilarating to watch and follow.  After having watched this flick both when it was released in theatres and on DVD, I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially when I re-examined the character over and over again.There were wonderful performances by Theresa Randle, D.B. Sweeney, Martin Sheen and of course Michael Jai White.  The pacing was reasonably well organized, the cinematography, some of the best of seen and the special effects are first rate.The only thing that could have been more developed was Spawn's deep-rooted anguish toward life, himself and the loss of his humanity, and having to strife to make sense of his super-powers.I thought this movie was actually deserving of a sequel.I do agree that the animated series is amazing and more faithful to the comics...but for an action-packed flick, &quot;Spawn&quot; does deliver...I believe that for most the intelligence required to truly understand the depth of such a character can be quite trying.My rating: Very Very Good.",4,"Spawn is different, original, sophisticated and intelligent",1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,4817,"['most', 'would', 'agree', 'quot',

29847,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780620003,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","A special effects marvel, `Spawn' is still an impressive feat in CGI even today.  The way that this film uses its strengths to propel this violent superhero epic is simply arresting.  I remember when Spawn was a popular superhero.  He was this bloody, demonic anti-hero who became the obsession of countless pre-teens who needed yet another way in which to show minor acts of rebellion.  We flocked to this film in droves (it was originally released in a PG-13 version) and then wet our pants when the director's cut was unleashed on us.This movie is all sorts of terrible.It is funny how things look in retrospect.  I have nothing but fond memories of this film, but watching it recently only brought frustration to my face.  Like I said, I'm still heavily impressed with some of the visual work.  For the time in which this was filmed, it is ridiculously impressive.  The makeup department also had a field day making this film a macabre delight.  Sadly, the buck stops there.  The film itself lacks so much depth, and this is sad when you consider the depth given within the comics to this character.  I'm not saying he's profound or anything, but there is a lot of work given to fleshing out his backstory in the largely successful comic book series (which is now somewhat forgotten) and so it is sad to see that sort of wasted on a poorly construction barrage of violence.I wonder what Christopher Nolan could have done with this?  Shouldn't he direct ALL superhero movies?

Just before he dies,he made a deal with the Devil for the love of his wife.When he woke up again, he became a grotesque monster andcannot go back to his life.  He was also obessessed with seekingrevenge on the person who kills him.  However, if he kills badguys then it'll make Hell's army stronger, if he recklessly killsgood guys then it would be evil and causes chaos, which isgood for the Devil too.  Worst of all, no matter what he doeshe will waste his power (when he used up all powers he will die).Doing nothing isn't an option either, since bad guys will go afterhim and the people he loves.  Hence he has to struggle with hisown morality, the fact that he cannot be with his wife, and hisown existance.Interesting concept, eh?  Unfortunately, the movie did notcapture the spirit of the original idea.  We never really getinvolved with Spawn's internal struggle, hence we don't reallycare about the main character at all.  The senses of irony associatedwith ""no matter what Spawn do it's bad"" weren't created in the movie.Nor did the movie really explain the hell/spawn relationship.Only the action scences are somewhat worth praising.Also, Cog in the movie is different from the original ideas.

Good acting, screenplay, special effects, and music make it above average. I have seen many movies converted from comics and Spawn was passed over by many. The clown and heavy metal music in some places may be a little abrasive to some, but the overall premise and delivery is not flawed. It may not be the caliber of Spiderman, but it certainly is a far cry from being a B movie. This is one definitely for fans of movies like ""Hellboy"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"". I like Superman, Batman, and Spiderman, but it is a refreshing change to see something that is not your mainstream comic book hero from time to time.Spawn is based on a human man who works as a soldier that assassinates people for the government. When he realizes they are being used and wants to leave they decide his usefulness is ended. Meanwhile Satan is in the background waiting for this all to happen and when he is killed by his boss, he of course goes to hell and is made into a super powered spawn of the devil, hence Spawn. Spawn wants revenge on his boss and will do anything to get back to his wife and little girl. A pact with the devil gets him his wish, but not the way he thought. When he finds out his best friend married his wife after his death, he adds him to his list to kill. While all this is going on he meets a soldier of God and a demon who acts like a clown.

Spawn is sent back to Earth with the task of collecting enough corrupt souls to wage a war on Heaven, but instead, he learns to masters his new powers in order to defeat the devil at his own game. This generation's hottest comic book hero leaps right off the page and on to the big screen in the 1997 film adaptation of SPAWN! Visual effects artist Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; holds true to the dark characters and themes of the comics, while providing audiences with a concise retelling of Spawn's origin story that is relatively faithful to Todd McFarlane's ground-breaking series. Dipp&eacute; enlists the help of the industry's leading special effects teams to handle the film's ambitious action sequences, using KNB FX for the costuming, and Industrial Light & Magic for the computerized imagery used throughout the film. The results are very mixed. KNB's costume redesigns are bulky considering the character's sleek appearance in the comics, but Spawn's burnt face and necroplasmic shell hold up to the company's high reputation. The computerized vision of Hell and Spawn's trademarked cape, on the other hand, look cartoony at best and have aged poorly. With the comic at the height of its success, however, it was the opportune time to release the film, even if the technology needed to do so properly did not exist. Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, and Martin Sheen are forgiven for their ridiculous and over-the-top performances given the extreme nature of their characters. While it is certainly flawed, SPAWN is entertaining and action-packed, and holds an equal appeal to both fans of the comics and newcomers, alike.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Spawn,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1774,"['devil', 'Malebogia', 'skilled', 'assassin', 'Earth', 'becoming', 'general', 'evil', 'armies', 'Hellspawn', 'Spawn', 'sent', 'back', 'Earth', 'task', 'collecting', 'enough', 'corrupt', 'souls', 'wage', 'war', 'Heaven', 'instead', 'masters', 'new', 'powers', 'order', 'defeat', 'devil', 'own', 'game', 'generation', 'hottest', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'leaps', 'right', 'page', 'big', 'screen', '1997', 'film', 'adaptation', 'SPAWN', 'Visual', 'effects', 'artist', 'Mark', 'A.Z', 'Dipp', 'eacute', 'true', 'dark', 'characters', 'themes', 'comics', 'providing', 'audiences', 'concise', 'retelling', 'Spawn', 'origin', 'story', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'ground-breaking', 'series', 'Dipp', 'eacute', 'help', 'industry', 'leading', 'special', 'effects', 'teams', 'handle', 'film', 'ambitious', 'action', 'sequences', 'using', 'KNB', 'FX', 'costuming', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'computerized', 'imagery', 'used', 'film', 'results', 'are', 'very', 'mixed', 'KNB', 'costume', 'redesigns', 'are', 'bulky', 'considering', 'character', 'sleek', 'appearance', 'comics', 'Spawn', 'burnt', 'face', 'necroplasmic', 'shell', 'hold', 'up', 'company', 'high', 'reputation', 'computerized', 'vision', 'Hell', 'Spawn', 'trademarked', 'cape', 'other', 'hand', 'look', 'cartoony', 'best', 'have', 'aged', 'poorly', 'comic', 'height', 'success', 'however', 'was', 'opportune', 'time', 'release', 'film', 'even', 'technology', 'needed', 'do', 'so', 'properly', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'are', 'forgiven', 'ridiculous', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'given', 'extreme', 'nature', 'characters', 'certainly', 'flawed', 'SPAWN', 'entertaining', 'action-packed', 'equal', 'appeal', 'fans', 'comics', 'newcomers', 'alike.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

29862,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0780620003,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","I came to this movie knowing basically nothing about the Spawn character, the comic strip, and the whole story behind Todd McFarlane's vaunted modern-day hero.  I am familiar with McFarlane's work on Spiderman in the early nineties, but that's basically it.  My reaction may thus be much different from devoted Spawn fans who had definite expectations from this film.  Fans are apt to either love or hate the real-life movie dramatization of a favorite character, and this movie had definite limits that could easily rub fans the wrong way.  I understand that there are some significant differences between the Spawn storyline we see here and that of the comic book series, that this is a much more linear retelling of the legend, one that could not afford to leave many unanswered questions at the end because the chances of making a sequel were unquantifiable at the time.  The special effects are not bad at all, but the movie suffers from the overinflated billing of these special effects; if the studio hadn't overplayed their hand by naming this &quot;the special-effects movie of the year&quot; 1997, all of the computer animation would have been scrutinized less completely by moviegoers.  The limitations imposed by the MPA ratings board in securing the film a PG-13 rating also basically ruined the film that was shown in theatres; this &quot;director's cut&quot; of the film is a complete and much, much better version than fans originally paid to see.Spawn, for those who don't know, is not your typical superhero.  Trained to be an elite assassin for the CIA, he ultimately decides to get out after a mission that kills a lot of civilians who, he was promised, would not be in the area of operations.  His boss, played quite wickedly by Martin Sheen, basically sets him up and has him killed.  Al Simmons, our hero's real name, goes from being burned alive to the always-flaming pits of hell, where he agrees to lead the devil's army in return for getting his wife back.  While no time has passed for him personally, five whole years have come and gone back on earth, his wife is married to his best friend, he's horribly burned and disfigured, a rude and crude Clown keeps pestering him, and some old guy in a long coat keeps giving him the business about taking the wrong path.  John Leguizamo is brilliant as Clown, the devil's representative on earth who has a hilarious yet nasty nature to match his dramatically strange appearance.  It is his job to make sure Simmons, now being reborn as Spawn, acts according to plan and starts Armageddon as scheduled.  Spawn isn't happy at all, despite the painfully new amazing armor his body begins to grow, and he lashes out in anger at the man he blames for his death. There is still a lot of Al Simmons underneath the scars and living armor, however, and the ultimate test will find him choosing whether to accede to the devil's plans or betray his evil covenant and become a dark angel for good in the world.There are a lot, and I do mean a lot of CGI effects in this movie.  Most of them are quite good, but as a whole the effects do not live up to their over hyped billing.  The scenes taking place in the pits of hell, in a sense thrown in during the final stages of production, do not look very real at all; in truth, they look like the kind of animated sequence you might find in the computers games Doom or Diablo.  Spawn's living armor is capable of extraordinary things, as is his vintage red cape, but some of the effects are a tad rough around the edges and all of them look and feel cinematic rather than truly realistic.  As explained in the film's commentary, time and budgetary constraints explain the limits seen in this regard.  Don't expect to see the world's greatest CGI here, and you stand less chance of being disappointed.  The human side of this story is a compelling one, even though the film does not allow for the type of exposition found in the comic book series, I am sure.  Spawn truly is a new kind of hero, a hero created from the pits of hell itself.  For my money, though, the antics and unforgettable performance of John Leguizamo as Clown steal the show.There are oodles of special features included on the DVD.  I made a point of listening to the commentary because I wanted to know more about Spawn's story, and it made for fascinating listening.  Featuring all of the men who basically created the movie, the most remarkable thing about the commentary is the list of all the cuts that had to be made in order to get a PG-13 rating for the film.  Many of these cuts are frankly ridiculous and show just how out of touch with reality the censors have become these days.  This theme is further expounded upon by Spawn creator Todd McFarlane in a series of fascinating interviews; you have to love the guy because he is anti-corporate to the core, fearlessly pointing out many of the problems with moviemaking today.  The making of featurette is good, the music videos are must-see (especially Marilyn Manson's), and there are loads of original sketches and illustrations that will be of interest to hard-core Spawn

29872,A23OR77VMYT5ZO,0780620003,"Eric Horton ""Ta-da!""","[5, 7]","Spawn was one of those movies (and there are many), that was so caught up in the special effects department that the plot and characters were thrown to the waste side.  In my opinion, it should have focused more on ""Damn, Al Simmons is one tortured soul"", as opposed to ""Wow, that's a cool cape, what's this movie about again?""Usually when one points out the pros and cons of a movie, the pros come first, but since I only have two, it leaves the cons to start it off.  Here we go.Cons1. To say the movie was miscast is an understatement (Terry, nuff said)2. Too much camp, not enough darkness.  If it's going to be R rated (DVD), then make it that way.  I've seen more violence in one episode of Smallville.3. The plot was just a highlight reel of Spawns abilities.  ""Hey, look, I can block a crotch kick with my belt buckle"".4. Waaaay too much exposition and not enough follow through.  The plot was too simple and there was no mystery to it.  Watching this movie was like cutting out all the 007 villain ""This is my plan for taking over the world"" scenes and putting them all together.5. What was the point of the homeless kid subplot?  It made no sense.6. The atmosphere and lighting wasn't dark enough.  Spawns makeup, because it was so illuminated, made his skin look like rubber.Pros1. John Leguizamo was outstanding as the clown.2. The special effects where done very well.Well, that's it folks.  Anyone reading this is probably wondering why someone who dislikes a movie so much would take the time to write so much about it?  Because I love trashing moves almost as much as praising them.  After following the HBO animated series (I didn't follow the comic, never have been a big comic collector), I was so disappointed when the movie went 180 degree's in the other direction, favoring a mass audience with a PG-13 rating.

Sure some if was dark, but it still was a nice take on the iconic character.  When McF went on and created SPAWN... it seemed like the reader would get the best of both worlds.  Something edgy, yet still mainstream.  SPAWN ended up being way too dark.In the film world... I think if they focused on making SPAWN a combination of a Batman/Spiderman-type of character...  that it could be really popular.  He could be as popular as any of those other mainstream characters.The problem is that McFarlane seems to want to go in a darker direction with his character, and this limits the potential of the property.

29889,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,0780620003,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 2]","During the 90's one of the biggest comic book franchises around was Spawn.  Created by former Spiderman artist, Todd McFarlane, Spawn was the hottest comic book commodity out there.  Image Comics was, and still is the home to the anti-hero from hell, and with numerous titles bearing the name Spawn (Spawn, Curse of Spawn, and Hellspawn; not to mention the spin-off series' Angela and Sam & Twitch), the character was quickly becoming Image's powerhouse rival to competitor's at DC and Marvel Comics.  With the characters enormous popularity, it wasn't long until movie studios came calling that were looking to adapt the anti-hero into a big screen movie, which is exactly what New Line Cinema succeeded in doing, just not with any satisfactory results.""Spawn"" essentially is the origin story for Image Comics' popular anti-hero.  We are introduced to Al Simmons (Michael Jai White as Al Simmons/Spawn), an American war hero turned black-ops for the C.I.A.  His latest mission went awry when civilians were killed during an assassination attempt, a job that the C.I.A. Director, Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), had assigned Al to carry out.  After this job, Al is set to retire, but not before doing one final job for the agency.  This final assignment as it turns out is nothing more than a ruse, as Al is assassinated by none other than Jason Wynn, in a plot that comes directly from the pits of hell.  Hell is fighting a war with Heaven, and Malebolgia the demon lord of hell, needs a someone to lead his unholy forces to the gates of Heaven and burn them down.  That someone is Al Simmons, Malebolgia tricks Al into believing that if he leads hell's army then he can be reunited with his wife on Earth, and of course Al takes the bait.  What Al didn't know, was that he wouldn't be returned until 5 years later and that he wouldn't look exactly like he used to (in fact, you could consider him a `crispy-critter'), his new charred appearance isn't the only change Al has to get used to, as his beloved wife Wanda has moved on with her life and is remarried.  Now that Al's former life is officially over, Malebolgia sends his demonic underling Clown/Violator (John Leguizamo) to sort of torment Al and show him the ropes in learning his new hell-powers, and to give him the name `Spawn'.  With his newfound powers Spawn has some plans of his own, in his mind Malebolgia didn't live up to his end of the bargain, so Spawn isn't about to lead hell's army anywhere, instead he's going to punish those who are responsible for his new lot in life, from Jason Wynn all the way to the depths of hell.This adaptation of ""Spawn"" had huge potential, but it just didn't live up to it.  Personally I'm surprised by some of the elements of the origin that were changed, especially since series creator Todd McFarlane was heavily involved with the making of this film.  Some disappointments about the origin are as follows:  Jason Wynn did not directly assassinate Al Simmons, instead he hired Al's best friend Chapel to do it (Chapel is not even shown in this film); Detective's Sam and Twitch are noticeably absent from all proceedings, I mean they could have at least been mentioned; and Terry Fitzgerald is a black guy, not a white guy.  Story changes aside, there were plenty of other problems with this film, the special effects while good for the most part, the scenes in hell were terrible, clearly they were trying to reach too far beyond the capabilities of their special effects creators.  And the biggest problem would have to be the story, it just wasn't that great of a story, the acting was good, but they didn't have much to work with.  Frankly, more time should have been put into making a really top-notch adaptation that was more faithful to the comics than simply trying to cash in on Spawn's popularity at the time.  At least the adult-oriented, animated series, ""Spawn"" on HBO was faithful, and truthfully much better than anything contained in this movie.If you absolutely love the character of Spawn then you'll probably enjoy this film somewhat, but will still be disappointed by the changes to the origin and other missing elements that make the comics so great.  Overall, a sub-par comic book adaptation, that could have been so much better than it actually was.""Spawn"" is rated R for violence and language.",2,Unholy Comic Book Adaptation...,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,4320,"['90', 'one', 'biggest', 'comic', 'book', 'franchises', 'was', 'Spawn', 'Created', 'former', 'Spiderman', 'artist', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'Spawn', 'was', 'hottest', 'comic', 'book', 'commodity', 'there', 'Image', 'Comics', 'was', 'still', 'home', 'anti-hero', 'hell', 'numerous', 'titles', 'bearing', 'name', 'Spawn', 'Spawn', 'Curse', 'Spawn', 'Hellspawn', 'not', 'mention', 'spin-off', 'series', 'Angela', 'Sam', 'Twitch', 'character', 'was', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'Image', 'powerhouse', 'rival', 'competitor', 'DC', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'characters', 'enormous', 'popularity', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'movie', 'studios', 'came', 'calling', 'were', 'looking', 'adapt', 'anti-hero', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'just', 'not', 'satisfactory', 'results', 'Spawn', 'essentially', 'origin', 'story', 'Image', 'Comics', 'popular', 'anti-hero', 'are', 'introduced', 'Al', 'Simmons', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'Al', 'Simmons/Spawn', 'American', 'war', 'hero', 'turned', 'black-ops', 'C.I.A', 'latest', 'mission', 'went', 'awry', 'when', 'civilians', 'were', 'killed', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'job', 'C.I.A', 'Director', 'Jason', 'Wynn', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'had', 'assigned', 'Al', 'carry', 'out', 'job', 'Al', 'set', 'retire', 'not', 'doing', 'one', 'final', 'job', 'agency', 'final', 'assignment', 'out', 'nothing', 'more', 'ruse', 'Al', 'assassinated', 'none', 'other', 'Jason', 'Wynn', 'plot', 'directly', 'pits', 'hell', 'Hell', 'fighting', 'war', 'Heaven', 'Malebolgia', 'demon', 'lord', 'hell', 'someone', 'lead', 'unholy', 'forces', 'gates', 'Heaven', 'burn', 'down', 'someone', 'Al', 'Simmons', 'Malebolgia', 'Al', 'believing', 'hell', 'army', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'reunited', 'wife', 'Earth', 'course', 'Al', 'bait', 'What', 'Al', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'returned', '5', 'years', 'later', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'exactly', 'used', 'fact', 'could', 'consider', 'crispy-critter', 'new', 'charred', 'appearance', ""n't"", 'only', 'change', 'Al', 'get', 'used', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Wanda', 'moved', 'life', 'remarried', 'Now', 'Al', 'former', 'life', 'officially', 'over', 'Malebolgia', 'demonic', 'underling', 'Clown/Violator', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'sort', 'torment', 'Al', 'show', 'ropes', 'learning', 'new', 'hell-powers', 'give', 'name', 'Spawn', 'newfound', 'powers', 'Spawn', 'plans', 'own', 'mind', 'Malebolgia', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'end', 'bargain', 'Spawn', ""n't"", 'about', 'lead', 'hell', 'army', 'anywhere', 'instead', 'going', 'punish', 'who', 'are', 'responsible', 'new', 'lot', 'life', 'Jason', 'Wynn', 'way', 'depths', 'hell.This', 'adaptation', 'Spawn', 'had', 'huge', 'potential', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'elements', 'origin', 'were', 'changed', 'especially', 'series', 'creator', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'was', 'heavily', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'disappointments', 'origin', 'are', 'Jason', 'Wynn', 'did', 'not', 'directly', 'assassinate', 'Al', 'Simmons', 'instead', 'hired', 'Al', 'best', 'friend', 'Chapel', 'do', 'Chapel', 'not', 'even', 'shown', 'film', 'Detective', 'Sam', 'Twitch', 'are', 'noticeably', 'absent', 'proceedings', 'mean', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'mentioned', 'Terry', 'Fitzgerald', 'black', 'guy', 'not', 'white', 'guy', 'Story', 'changes', 'aside', 'were', 'plenty', 'other', 'problems', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'scenes', 'hell', 'were', 'terrible', 'clearly', 'were', 'trying', 'reach', 'too', 'far', 'capabilities', 'special', 'effects', 'creators', 'biggest', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'story', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'Frankly', 'more', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'making', 'really', 'top-notch', 'adaptation', 'was', 'more', 'faithful', 'comics', 'simply', 'trying', 'cash', 'Spawn', 'popularity', 'time', 'least', 'adult-oriented', 'animated', 'series', 'Spawn', 'HBO', 'was', 'faithful', 'truthfully', 'much', 'better', 'anything', 'contained', 'movie.If', 'absolutely', 'love', 'character', 'Spawn', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'somewhat', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'disappointed', 'changes', 'origin', 'other', 'missing', 'elements', 'make', 'comics', 'so', 'great', 'Overall', 'sub-par', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'actually', 'was', 'Spawn', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language']",N/A

The good (Spider-man, The X-Men) and the gawd-awful (The Punisher and the Fantastic Four - both pitiable versions of each).Thanks to New Line Cinema - the wonder studio that brought us the Nightmare on Elm Street classics - the live action Spawn falls confortably into the second catagory, with crappy, on-the-cheap production values, schlocky 'B' movie direction from hack Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute;, and seemingly decent actors hamming it up while spouting cheesy dialogue. Michael Jai White (Spawn) poses and growls a lot, spending the majority of the film encased in makeup that consists of a plastic head and a dirty trench coat. Nicol Williams (Cogliostro) is oooh-so mysterious, and Martin Sheen does his best William Shatner impression as Spawn's ev-il nemesis, Jason Wynn. The only person who seems to get it at all is the always impressive John Leguizamo, the absolute perfect choice to play Violator. Lequizamo tears into his part with a vicious glee no one else here can quite muster.I wasn't a big fan of the Spawn comic, but this mess is garbage, barely worth the one star rating, strictly for Leguizamo's performance.

It has a lot of fantastic -- meaning out of this world, not necessarily great -- imagry but not much else to recommend.Some of the other reviewers seem to know what's going on in this movie. It appeared to me the story was two enemies battle each other in a good vs. evil episode. I guess that's the story here, although that fat clown that turns into a computer-generated dragon won't go down in film history as one of the great bad guys of all time.What I did find entertaining were the computer scenes in Hell, where the good guy and a buddy battled the dragon. That was pretty interesting, what with all the heat and flames and darkness along the way.I am not naturally drawn to this kind of movie -- something based on a comic book that is a complete fantasy where just about nothing in the movie could happen in real life.Having said that, I greatly enjoyed and admired ""RoboCop"" when it came out and set a new standard for computer-generated action.

29903,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,0780620003,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[23, 31]","Todd McFarlane began the 'Spawn' comic series in 1992.  The series went on to set records for comic sales.  My own personal knowledge of 'Spawn' comes from the large number of imaginative action figures that appear on many toy and comic store shelves.  I have bought and set up several, and I decided to see the film to get some insight into the story behind the figures.The film starts like a buzz saw.  You are dumped right into the life of secret agent/assassin Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) as he destroys a planeload of people, realizes what he had done, and tries to leave the agency for whom he worked.  Needless to say, his evil boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) has no intention of letting him go.  Wynn tricks Simmons into one 'last' assignment.  It's a setup, and Simmons is toasted for real.Suddenly (everything is sudden in this film) it is five years later.  Simmons pops back into existence, looking like the aftermath of a nuclear explosion, with a severe memory shortage.  A really gross clown (John Leguizamo) keeps trying to be his buddy, his best friend has married his girlfriend, and the only thing that remembers him is his dog - Spaz (I don't know who played the dog).  This is a situation that can only get worse, and sure enough, that's what it does.The basic plot turns on Simmons' (now called Spawn) moral progress.  Hell has been tempting souls all over the world in order to create an army of badness.  Now they want Spawn to be the general of that army and lead the last apocalyptic attack on heaven.  In order to qualify, that have to play on Spawn's anger and thirst for vengeance until he does something so bad that he loses all his humanity.  Of course, this involves killing most of the people in the world.  Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) plays the good guy, trying to help Spawn keep his humanity.My immediate problem with 'Spawn' was that it was not 'Blade.'  It took me the first 15 minutes of the film to get over that.  I think this was really a matter of seeing 'Blade' just before viewing 'Spawn.'  Once I was able to get into the movie a bit, I found that my original reaction was overkill.  Even so, most of the script is people morphing into things that kill and then smashing other people into smithereens.  Yes, there is a plot, but its primary purpose is to provide an excuse for a steady procession of outrageous (but bloodless) violence.  Exactly how it managed to hold on to a PG-13 rating is beyond me.  'Blade' had an element of style that is simply lacking in 'Spawn.'The cast consists of many skilled and experienced players (Martin Sheen's film credits are probably longer than the script).  Unfortunately, the pace is so intense that the only character you get to know well is that godforsaken clown, and you will really wish that you hadn't.  Most of the other characters are limited to parts that are heavily typecast.  Despite this, 'Spawn' is almost a very good film.  Many of the special effects are great, and there certainly isn't anything wrong with a lot of fast-paced action.  However, the story never completely gripped me, and the film work is a bit too claustrophobic.  Still, it's worth seeing if you get a chance.",3,Never Trust a Fat Clown,1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,3184,"['Todd', 'McFarlane', 'began', ""'Spawn"", 'comic', 'series', '1992', 'series', 'went', 'set', 'records', 'comic', 'sales', 'own', 'personal', 'knowledge', ""'Spawn"", 'large', 'number', 'imaginative', 'action', 'figures', 'appear', 'many', 'toy', 'comic', 'store', 'shelves', 'have', 'bought', 'set', 'up', 'several', 'decided', 'see', 'film', 'get', 'insight', 'story', 'figures.The', 'film', 'buzz', 'saw', 'are', 'dumped', 'right', 'life', 'secret', 'agent/assassin', 'Al', 'Simmons', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'planeload', 'people', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'tries', 'leave', 'agency', 'whom', 'worked', 'Needless', 'say', 'evil', 'boss', 'Jason', 'Wynn', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'intention', 'letting', 'go', 'Wynn', 'tricks', 'Simmons', 'one', ""'last"", 'assignment', 'setup', 'Simmons', 'toasted', 'real.Suddenly', 'everything', 'sudden', 'film', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Simmons', 'pops', 'back', 'existence', 'looking', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'severe', 'memory', 'shortage', 'really', 'gross', 'clown', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'trying', 'be', 'buddy', 'best', 'friend', 'married', 'girlfriend', 'only', 'thing', 'dog', 'Spaz', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'played', 'dog', 'situation', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'sure', 'enough', 'what', 'basic', 'plot', 'turns', 'Simmons', 'now', 'called', 'Spawn', 'moral', 'progress', 'Hell', 'been', 'tempting', 'souls', 'world', 'order', 'create', 'army', 'badness', 'Now', 'want', 'Spawn', 'be', 'general', 'army', 'lead', 'last', 'apocalyptic', 'attack', 'heaven', 'order', 'qualify', 'have', 'play', 'Spawn', 'anger', 'thirst', 'vengeance', 'something', 'so', 'bad', 'humanity', 'course', 'killing', 'most', 'people', 'world', 'Cogliostro', 'Nicol', 'Williamson', 'good', 'guy', 'trying', 'help', 'Spawn', 'keep', 'humanity.My', 'immediate', 'problem', ""'Spawn"", 'was', 'was', 'not', ""'Blade"", 'took', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'get', 'think', 'was', 'really', 'matter', 'seeing', ""'Blade"", 'just', 'viewing', ""'Spawn"", 'Once', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'movie', 'bit', 'found', 'original', 'reaction', 'was', 'overkill', 'Even', 'so', 'most', 'script', 'people', 'morphing', 'things', 'kill', 'then', 'smashing', 'other', 'people', 'smithereens', 'Yes', 'plot', 'primary', 'purpose', 'provide', 'excuse', 'steady', 'procession', 'outrageous', 'bloodless', 'violence', 'Exactly', 'how', 'managed', 'hold', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'had', 'element', 'style', 'simply', 'lacking', ""'Spawn"", 'cast', 'many', 'skilled', 'experienced', 'players', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'film', 'credits', 'are', 'probably', 'longer', 'script', 'Unfortunately', 'pace', 'so', 'intense', 'only', 'character', 'get', 'know', 'well', 'godforsaken', 'clown', 'will', 'really', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'limited', 'parts', 'are', 'heavily', 'typecast', 'almost', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Many', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'anything', 'wrong', 'lot', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'However', 'story', 'never', 'completely', 'gripped', 'film', 'work', 'bit', 'too', 'claustrophobic', 'Still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'get', 'chance']",N/A

A recent re-viewing, however, was particularly damaging to the action spectacle that I had kept in my memory, and I'm sorry to say that I'm no longer a fan of the film. Based on comic guru Todd McFarlane's magnum opus of the same name, ""Spawn"" was largely a showcase of what you could achieve with special effects and CGI animation ten years ago; needless to say, the near-monthly ascension of such technology has left the film almost completely obsolete in this day and age. With no memorable acting and a storyline that was recently reworked into ""Ghost Rider"", I'd think that the only fans of the films were those that saw it when it first came out and continue to put up with it.Al Simmons (Michael Jai White,Exit Wounds) is a deadly mercenary deceived into furthering the political agenda of evil corporation-owner Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen,The West Wing: The Complete Series Collection). Upon discovering all the trouble he's unknowingly been causing, Simmons wants out, but is double-crossed and murdered by Wynn, who is in cahoots with a demonic clown (John Leguizamo,Executive Decision) eager for Simmons' soul. Following a pact with the devil and a five-year internment in hell, Simmons returns to earth to find the life and world he knew long gone, with the clown gleefully enticing him to bring on the apocalypse. Only by regaining his humanity with the aid of a mysterious wizard (Nicol Williamson,Excalibur) can he foil the plans of hell and protect the family he was forced to leave behind.If you're going to watch ""Spawn"", pick up the director's cut - the theatrical release is relentless in its ""let's-make-it-watchable-for-teens"" homogeny: cuts and voiceovers galore, etc. However, even with the inserted cursing, sexual references, and increased violence of the unrated version, the film is in trouble: moving at a breakneck pace that allows no room for character development, the acting - especially Sheen's performance - is left looking extremely hammy, and the numerous action scenes are no more than showcases for what the SFX department can up with (i.e. the ballroom and chase scenes mainly highlight Spawn's animated cape) - in other words, there's no substance behind the shootouts, chases, and fisticuffs. Co-stars Theresa Randle (Space Jam), Melinda Clarke (The O.C.: The Complete Series Collection), and D.B. Sweeney (The Cutting Edge) aren't given all too much time to add to the story, so more or less, they're just there to fill in the roles occupied in the comic.If the film does have a definitive asset, it's Leguizamo's performance: with the help of a truckload of makeup and prosthetics, he brings the Clown to life with a dirty grace and soiled charm that even the comics or later animated series were unable to capture. In addition, the Violator (Clown's monstrous alter-ego) is just about the best animation in the movie: its three scenes are highlights of the film, some of which still look decent today.Sadly, these two fellows only make up so much of the movie, and thus, we're left with the comic book-style pacing, a rather lacklustre Spawn costume (White's makeup is cool, but without the cape, he looks rather diminutive), and the overabundance of dated CGI. The scenes in hell are particularly difficult to watch to folks who have seen ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", and previous jaw-droppers like Spawn crashing through the ceiling at the ball will now qualify as ""ho-hum"" in quality.Since ""Spawn"", director Mark Dipp&eacute; has been forced into strict TV and DTV work, and Nicol Williamson has yet to appear in another film: how much this actually has to do with the contents of the movie is unsure, but it's poetic to think that ""Spawn"" proves the point that even the best-funded of movies cannot rely solely on technology to leave a mark in cinema history.

Apart from that, and an attractive visual style,  this film is awful, and I hate it in so many ways.As a translation of  the comic book, it's terrible, missing the atmosphere completely.

Al Simmons is an ex-government agent who gets killed by his boss's underling during his final hit.

Violator is ordered to keep an eye on Spawn to make sure he follows through on his promise.Opinion: This movie could have been great so what went wrong? Miscast. Michael Jai White is perfect as Spawn but whoever thought that John Leguizamo made a perfect Violator needs a swift kick in the rear end. Granted that Violator is an annoying creep in the comic book but John Leguizamo makes him more cartoonish and goofy than the comic book ever did! Martin Sheen is usually good but he was not at his best in this movie. His performance was kind of questionable. I gave it two stars because its okay at times like Spawn's battle with Violator and Spawn crashing in on his former boss at a banquet.

29913,A1MZW5Z6RFSIZI,0780620003,"Old School Gamer ""What the hell's a gigawatt!?!""","[0, 2]","I had always had a weird curiosity about this movie but I didn't even remember it existed until recently when a friend mentioned it during a discussion. He basically told me it was one of the worst movies he had ever seen and it peaked my interest even more because it didn't look THAT bad from the previews I remembered.The story/screenplay is laughable at best. The premise is cool and I know the actual comic book is much moe brutal and unrelenting(which is why this movie seemed like it had some hope, at least). The writers did a lot more telling than showing, however, and scenes like Spawn's ""training"" with Mr. old-guy-always-appearing-out-of-thin-air is just plain ridiculous. It took Luke years to gain even rudimentary knowledge of the Force in Star Wars and yet Spawn seems to learn how to use any ability he wants when a guy tells him that he has ""trillions of nerves"" he can control. Give me a break. Not only is this just plain bad writing, but the director doesn't even pass it off well by giving it at least some kind of weight. The scene takes all of a minute to develope and by the end Spawn is able to control more abilities than god just by ""thinking"" of performing the action. Awesome.The actors are likewise a travesty. The guy who plays Spawn doesn't have a fully-developed acting bone in his body. Gritting your teeth and talking like you're a badd-arse from the streets of south-side Chicago doesn't constitute believability. Martin Sheene makes his son Charlie look like the best actor in Hollywood, but I don't really blame him. I'm sure the director told him to camp up his performance so as to appear like a sadistic madman. The problem is that nothing is developed with his character. He just starts out at ""madman"" and end's at ""madman."" The whole ""Spawn fights for his gf"" bologny is just as stupid. We never see them together and don't get any chance to inest feelings of compassion in either character. We just see a few flashbacks showing his laughable moments of closeness between Spawn and his cardboard gf. The Clown form of Violator was obnoxious and not even slightly funny. He goes from making harmless jokes that are PG-13 to R within the same sentence as well, which makes no sense. If he is going to be lude, make him lude the whole movie. If he is making jokes like Bob Saget, then let him do so for the whole movie. Mixing and matching just made no sense, as if he didn't want to offend poor Spawn. I don't know where to even begin on the other actors.The story was terrible. I don't know if it follows the comicbook all that closelly, but I would certainly hope not. Even something like Batman or the X-men often gives a lot of good writing and useful sections that help see the true character of the heroes. Granted, comicbooks offer didactic ""good vs. evil"" montages, but they're generally done quite well. The whole scheme to get Spawn to command the armies of Hell wasn't needed. They could have easily made him do it from the get-go, before he decided to fight for ""good"". I know they needed some kind of plot, but there are much better ways to try and bring these characters together.I was expecting some cool fight scenes at the very least. Violator is a great villian with a lot of potential, as are all of McFarlane's creations, the problem is that he is terribly portrayed yet again. He just runs around grabbing people instead of outright destroying them. He wouldn't toy with his victims by batting them around. Just freakin eat them or smash their faces in. Not only that, but how the heck does something that big and loud ""hide"" from Spawn on more than one occasion? Honestly. One chase scene doesn't even serve a purpose in the film other than to oblige action film fans who seem to think it's mandatory. Couldn't Spawn just fly around instead of riding a motorcycle? *sigh*The effects for Violator and Spawn's chains/cape were pretty well done for 1997, I will say, but thats unfortunatelly the best part of the whole movie and that's not saying much. The effects usesd to create Hell were also poorly done. It looks more like a big red backdrop that someone threw a bag of Cheetos all over, it was not intimidating in any way(again, I think this was a poor choice by screenwriter/director to even include this setting when cg effects clearly weren't going to cut it in 1997).It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is certainly up there. From the terrible acting to the horrendous script to the poorly constructed ""motivation"" behind anyones actions, it's just a very bad film. I would hope that someone has the courage at some point soon to renew the interest in the franchise by making a legitimate film with todays technology. The most important part of any film to this day is still a great screenplay, however, and until we get that, this superhero has no hope. I only recommend this to filmmakers who wish to use it as a reference point for what NOT to do or avid fans of the comicbook.",2,This movie makes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles look like Schinlder's

You HAD to see it. Viewing it fifteen years later, I've come to learn a few things. Firstly, Spawn is a rather uninteresting, bland film. Secondly, I was quite gullible as a teenager.Today, Spawn's special effects range from average to really, really bad. The actors are of a B-movie quality, especially Martin Sheen, who should do us all a favour and stick to TV acting. I was frustrated, watching this film again after so many years, hoping it would improve as nostalgic memories came flooding back of happy times with friends, watching Spawn, gulping down buckets of popcorn and liters of soda while being very impressed with this cool new film!  Are teenagers really that impressionable? I guess I was.Nothing interesting happens in this film; the script moves predictably from one violent scene to the next. Character development is poor, or non-existing. The film is utterly devoid of humour. I can't recommend this movie.

29928,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0780620003,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 6]","This flick was a belated attempt to cash-in on the run of dark comic book heroes sparked in 1989 with ""Batman"".  Though having CGI graphics, and even tossing in a demented clown character, nothing here comes close to matching that earlier hit.The Story: Al Simmons (White) is your basic can-do spec-ops master.  Doing various impossible dirty jobs for a super secret agency run by the odious Jason Wynn (Sheen) that require him to sneak around fortified installations across the world with timed charges and a sub-machine gun, White is seeking a way out.  He knows he's being set by Wynn and his toady (Sweeny), but doesn't have an idea of how deep Wynn's betrayal goes.  When Wynn turns on White during The-Last-Mission (an intentionally botched demolition of a classified bio-warfare installation), he incinerates White and leaves him to burn with the rest of the factory.  Wynn, it turns out, was in league with no less than Hell itself - selling his country (and White) to the devil in return for immeasurable power.  Hell, it goes without saying, has its own plans, which include an army of the damned ready to march on the land of the living, and led by a savagely scarred warrior who is none other than White himself.  Agreeing to lead the forces of Hell in return for a chance to see his beloved Wanda, White becomes ""Spawn"" - an unstoppable warrior clad in living armor - and returns to Earth.  Forgetting the deal (and just about everything else) when he first returns, White gets a rude wake-up from ""The Clown"" (Leguizamo), one of Hell's more lewd minions.  (Clad in what looks like gallons of laytex, Leguizamo's hard to recognize - for years, I thought Chris Farley had the part).  When the his dirty jokes don't make the point clear enough, Clown morphs into the horrible ""Violator"" a hulking terror that tosses Spawn around like a rag-doll.  Though not quite in league with old scratch, Spawn can't divorce himself from the pact since obeying it will allow him a shot at Jason Wynn.  Wynn, learning of Spawn's pursuit of him, and still thinking himself in league with Hell, has himself implanted with a device triggered to detonate and release huge stockpiles of the deadly gas, should he should die.  Spawn doesn't know about the implant, but then Wynn doesn't know that the devil is playing him and Spawn off each other.  With its unspeakable powers, the forces of Hell could overrun the world, but even the devil must follow the laws of irony (in short, the plan is for Spawn to freely kill Wynn in revenge, and thus release the toxin that will destroy our world).  To balance out evil, the forces of good have their own warrior - Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson, and no, he doesn't redo the Merlin act from ""Excalibur"") - who tries to show Spawn that he still has free-will, and that his powers can defeat evil.  While Spawn eventually turns to the way of good (dark powers, living-armor, machine guns and all), the tug of war between good and evil insures that we'll see a lot of those powers and other CGI.So what's wrong with this movie?  The plot is convoluted - the elaborate plan by which Spawn will destroy all live on Earth by killing Wynn seems like irony for irony's sake.  Since the devil is neither a real character in the story nor the hint of a bigger character (he appears as a big CGI affect in one of the supposedly climactic scenes) it's hard to see the plan as actually being a plan put in motion by a character, instead of just an excuse to plump the plot.  Actually, there aren't any real characters at all - once White's outer body is stripped, he never forms anything real to replace his identity.  Wynn is just odious, Cogliostro just noble, Sweeny is just...well, Sweeny.  The script gives a lot of attention to the Clown, but then he becomes the Violator, and his character disappears entirely (which is little loss, since the Clown's good for nothing but vile and obvious jokes - the worst one delivered at the end after he's been de-capitated.  The sanitized version of that line is the single least-inspired TV-edit ever).  The action sequences lose it after a while, boiling down to pointless CGI romps.  During the climax set in Hell, I kept wondering - ""what the hell's going on?""  There are no funny lines, memorable characters or anything else to stick in your head.  This flick is like ""The Phantom Menace"" with pitchforks instead of lightsabers.

29941,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0780620003,trebe,"[1, 2]","Spawn, the Director's cut, presents a more complete vision of Todd MacFarlane's comic book creation, than the PG13 version featured in its theatrical release in 1997.  Having never read the comic, I can't speak with any authority how successful the movie is at capturing the true spirit of the comic.  Nevertheless, I found Spawn to be very entertaining, with a style and tone that reflects its comic book genesis.  The characters are not particularly deep, motivations are basic, and the dialog is at times, pretentious, grandiose and ridiculous.  The reedited version flows better, is more violent, and is punctuated by a quick-cut editing style, and creative scene transitions.  It is the story of a man burnt to death, who returns to Earth after making a bargain with the Devil (Malebolgia).Since the story is based on a comic book, I was willing to cut the movie a bit more slack than normal.  But such additional allowances are not really necessary.  The film does a fairly good job of explaining Spawn's significance, and the nature of his powers.  He goes through a continuous learning process, discovering just what he can, and should do.  Gradually evolving from using firearms, to utilizing the intrinsic weapon of his own body armor.  The commentary track is very helpful in understanding what the whole story is about.  As is Todd McFarlane's edgy, ""take it or leave it"" style interview.Spawn, taps into a number of man's basic fears, fire, burning alive and eternal hell.  For justice to be done to this story, the special effects needed to be outstanding, and they are.  Costuming and makeup, for the primary characters of Spawn, and Clown are great.  Computer generated (CG) effects became prevalent in the late 90's, and Spawn is a good example of a film where CG effects begin to take over.  Almost all of the effects work very well.  The ""capework"", Spawn's protective armor, and his spike and chain defense mechanisms are particularly effective.  The fiery tunnel down to Hell looks cool, but the vision of Hell didn't quite work for me.  The ""masses"" look way too fake, and the character of Malebolgia, (the Devil) just made me laugh.  With flapping jowls, he conjures up images of a hellish ""Big Bad Wolf"", crossed with a CG monster from a USMC recruiting commercial.  The final battle in Hell looks a bit disjointed, and the quality suffers a bit.  The budgetary reasons for this are explained in the commentary.Spawn, is a story of a man, struggling to understand his place, in a world where he no longer belongs.  Learning about himself, his powers, and how to control them.  You don't see much of his real face, but Michael Jai White brings a great deal of humanity, and sadness to the character.  Unfortunately for Jai White, a man who is blessed with an incredible physique, this film does not appear to have done too much for his career.  John Leguizamo's transition to the lewd, rude, and evil Clown, is quite remarkable.  His performance is creative, and with humor that does not appear forced.  Martin Sheen, provides name recognition, and does a serviceable job as the ruthless ""Wynn"".  Spawn, is a solid fantasy adventure.  Worth your time if you are interested in the genre.

After I bought the dvd (out of loyalty to spawn)I listened to the director's commentary...then I hated the movie.  Listening to Mark Dippe, the director, was liking putting a face to incompetence.  Not only was this the most boring action movie in history it was the most claustrophobic. not two seconds go by before we see another close-up.  It's annoying that the director never gets an actors whole head in one of his million close ups.  It's like Dippe has no idea about framing.  Some holes in the plot that bother me in retrospect are 1. the motorcycle scene: why in the hell would someone who could fly ride a motorcycle.  2. Wynn storming wanda's house:  From what I can piece together the CIA is composed of Al Simmons, Priest, Wynn, and Terry Fitzgerald.  He kills Al, Al kills Priest, and Wynn alienates Terry, so the director of the CIA has to do his own dirty work.
