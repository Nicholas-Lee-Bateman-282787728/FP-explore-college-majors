When the Bolshoi makes a movie, they just set up a camera or three in front of the stage, and you get no more than the audience gets. And you listen to the audience applause every so often, to let you know you should admire that particular bit. The American Ballet -- and the British -- make a movie of it, with different camera angles, including close-ups, and sets that could not be contained on a theater stage, and even a few special effects. They're still telling a story in music and dance, but they take advantage of what film can do. Also, the costumes are so much better. Again, they tend to go beyond what would be effective on a stage.Giselle is the story of a young country woman who being courted by a neighbor when a stranger came to town and totally captivated her. When she eventually learns that he is already married, she more-or-less dies of a broken heart. (It may seem like suicide, but I don't think it is meant to be.)Turns out there is a whole troupe of ghosts out in the woods composed of women who died of disappointments in love. They come dance on her grave and raise her up to be one of them. But their motive is to take vengeance on men by capturing them and forcing them to dance with them until they die.Both of the rivals for Giselle's affection are captured, but apparently what happens is the local fellow dies and so does the married one, but Giselle revives him. It's not clear, because I did not pay enough attention when the program notes were on screen before the music started. Still, the music is grand, the dancing is marvelous, and the sets and costumes all they should be. It's just a pleasure to absorb the experience and not worry overmuch about the story line.",4,"Charming Story, Excellent Dancers and Costumes",1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1802,"['Excellent', 'great', 'example', 'why', 'like', 'American', 'Ballet', 'better', 'Bolshoi', 'When', 'Bolshoi', 'movie', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'camera', 'three', 'front', 'stage', 'get', 'more', 'audience', 'listen', 'audience', 'applause', 'so', 'often', 'let', 'know', 'should', 'admire', 'particular', 'bit', 'American', 'Ballet', 'British', 'make', 'movie', 'different', 'camera', 'angles', 'including', 'close-ups', 'sets', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'contained', 'theater', 'stage', 'even', 'few', 'special', 'effects', ""'re"", 'still', 'telling', 'story', 'music', 'dance', 'take', 'advantage', 'what', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'Also', 'costumes', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Again', 'tend', 'go', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'effective', 'stage.Giselle', 'story', 'young', 'country', 'woman', 'who', 'being', 'courted', 'neighbor', 'when', 'stranger', 'came', 'town', 'totally', 'captivated', 'When', 'eventually', 'already', 'married', 'more-or-less', 'dies', 'broken', 'heart', 'may', 'seem', 'suicide', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'meant', 'be', 'out', 'whole', 'troupe', 'ghosts', 'out', 'woods', 'composed', 'women', 'who', 'died', 'disappointments', 'love', 'come', 'dance', 'grave', 'raise', 'be', 'one', 'motive', 'take', 'vengeance', 'men', 'capturing', 'forcing', 'dance', 'rivals', 'Giselle', 'affection', 'are', 'captured', 'apparently', 'what', 'local', 'fellow', 'dies', 'so', 'married', 'one', 'Giselle', 'not', 'clear', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'enough', 'attention', 'when', 'program', 'notes', 'were', 'screen', 'music', 'started', 'Still', 'music', 'grand', 'dancing', 'marvelous', 'sets', 'costumes', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'pleasure', 'absorb', 'experience', 'not', 'worry', 'overmuch', 'story', 'line']",N/A

M WILINSKY,"[11, 13]","This studio performance of Giselle by the great team of Carla Fracci and Erik Bruhn, with members of the ABT and the Berlin Opera Orchestra was recorded in 1968, but it looks like it was done only yesterday!  I do not know exactly how Deutsche Grammophon accomplished this feat, but the image(full screen) and sound(DTS 5.1) are absolutely at the highest standard, even by today's strict digital degree of perfection(this is shot on film with the crisp images that it imparts).  The dancing itself is by some of the ballet greats of recent history and so, this qualifies also as a classic performance( I know of no other case where these two qualities come together in one recording!). Fracci and Bruhn are at their very best here, and we can see why they are so well regarded by history. Great artists are able to perform by the usual classical standards, but in an indescribable way that makes their performance unique.  The choreography is also excellent and complete with the peasant pas de deux included as well as all the second act variations.  The part of Hilarion, danced by Bruce Marks, is also given very extensive choreography in the second act and he dances it very well.The orchestra, conducted by John Lanchbery, plays with fantastic depth of feeling and is a wonderful feature of this DVD.The camera work is something that has not been seen before, nor after.  It is very unusual and distinctive for a ballet movie, even a dance-for-camera movie.  It highlights the great acting and facial reactions by a variety of occasional closeups to the point where we can at times see the pores in their skin.  Do not become alarmed that this is a problem.  Most(85%) of the time the camera is used conventionally, but at other times it really draws us into the action as never before!  In every ballet the camera sometimes leaves out a view of the steps, and that happens here a few times, but it is done to good effect and only repetitive steps are compromised by this, so you actually are not left wondering what is happening.  The coverage of the corps de ballet is superb, using a variety of shots, including floor level views and closeups of the footwork.  There are even a few shots from under a transparent floor.  There are also a few outdoor shots, and the entrance of the royals is one of them, showing us how they ride through the woods on horseback(real horses and hounds!); This is the most extensive version of this scene in any Giselle performance that I know of.All in all, this is certainly one of the finest versions of Giselle on DVD, and suitable for all collections, whether it is your only Giselle, or added to your collection as a classic.",5,One Of The Most Beautiful Versions Of Giselle On DVD!,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,2669,"['studio', 'performance', 'Giselle', 'great', 'team', 'Carla', 'Fracci', 'Erik', 'Bruhn', 'members', 'ABT', 'Berlin', 'Opera', 'Orchestra', 'was', 'recorded', '1968', 'was', 'done', 'only', 'yesterday', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'Deutsche', 'Grammophon', 'accomplished', 'feat', 'image', 'full', 'screen', 'sound', 'DTS', '5.1', 'are', 'absolutely', 'highest', 'standard', 'even', 'today', 'strict', 'digital', 'degree', 'perfection', 'shot', 'film', 'crisp', 'dancing', 'ballet', 'greats', 'recent', 'history', 'so', 'qualifies', 'also', 'classic', 'performance', 'know', 'other', 'case', 'where', 'two', 'qualities', 'come', 'together', 'one', 'recording', 'Fracci', 'Bruhn', 'are', 'very', 'best', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'regarded', 'history', 'Great', 'artists', 'are', 'able', 'perform', 'usual', 'classical', 'standards', 'indescribable', 'way', 'performance', 'unique', 'choreography', 'also', 'excellent', 'complete', 'peasant', 'pas', 'deux', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'act', 'variations', 'part', 'Hilarion', 'danced', 'Bruce', 'Marks', 'also', 'given', 'very', 'extensive', 'choreography', 'second', 'act', 'very', 'well.The', 'orchestra', 'conducted', 'John', 'Lanchbery', 'fantastic', 'depth', 'feeling', 'wonderful', 'feature', 'DVD.The', 'camera', 'work', 'something', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'very', 'unusual', 'distinctive', 'ballet', 'movie', 'even', 'dance-for-camera', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'facial', 'reactions', 'variety', 'occasional', 'closeups', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'times', 'see', 'pores', 'skin', 'Do', 'not', 'become', 'alarmed', 'problem', 'Most', '85', '%', 'time', 'camera', 'used', 'conventionally', 'other', 'times', 'really', 'action', 'never', 'ballet', 'camera', 'sometimes', 'out', 'view', 'steps', 'here', 'few', 'times', 'done', 'good', 'effect', 'only', 'repetitive', 'steps', 'are', 'compromised', 'actually', 'are', 'not', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'happening', 'coverage', 'corps', 'ballet', 'superb', 'using', 'variety', 'shots', 'including', 'floor', 'level', 'views', 'closeups', 'footwork', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'shots', 'transparent', 'floor', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'entrance', 'royals', 'one', 'showing', 'how', 'ride', 'woods', 'horseback', 'real', 'horses', 'hounds', 'most', 'extensive', 'version', 'scene', 'Giselle', 'performance', 'know', 'of.All', 'certainly', 'one', 'finest', 'versions', 'Giselle', 'DVD', 'suitable', 'collections', 'only', 'Giselle', 'added', 'collection', 'classic']",N/A

Shot in a studio the first act set resembles the ABT first act but the second act looks like a one set fits all from an old Omnibus TV presentation.  The director seems to have seen Godard's Breathless and never gotten over it.  Instead of seeing the dance and complete steps the choreography comes at the viewer as a series of jump cuts from different angles often with people or stage props  between the viewer and dancers; like bursts of machine gun fire.

904761,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B0009FU08S,K. Boullosa,"[14, 14]","Being of a certain age, I saw these two luminaries of ballet history perform Giselle with American Ballet Theatre in 1967 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music - a never to be forgotten evening.  This DVD captures the qualities that made those performances legendary.  Erik Bruhn's nobility of line and clean technique, Fracci's ravishing second act, with her melting port de bras and weightlessness, her touching and unforced first act with its beautifully acted Mad Scene, are all here. Bruhn, at about 42, was at the end of his career here while Fracci, at about 30, was at the height of hers, but they work magically together.  Fracci has a beautiful face but a less than beautifully muscled body compared to other ballerinas, yet somehow, her (I believe underrated) technique infuses all Giselle's movements with beauty.  I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who preferred Fracci's first act to her second act. I think her second act here is stunning - as a TIMES reviewer once put it reviewing her ""Giselle"", ""She touched the heart as well as the eye.""To me she was not ""cold and distant"" as characterized by a reviewer below, but out of reach, as a ghost naturally is.Not to be overlooked is the late Toni Lander's marvellous Myrthe, Queen of the Wilis - all cold purpose and fine technique - Lander, who was Bruhn's countrywoman as well as his colleague, was a wonderful dancer and Myrthe's opening solo in Act II is a very difficult one.Ted Kivitt and Eleanor D'Antuono, ABT's home-grown soloists who did eventually become principal dancers with the company, are delightful in the Peasant Pas de Deux in Act I.  Both went on to dance the leading roles in ""Giselle"" but received scant attention because of the presence in the company of superstars like Bruhn, Fracci, Makarova, and Baryshnikov.  Kivitt's and D'Antuono's earnest, well-danced performances were no match for the charisma of the foreign stars that ABT imported.  It was an unfair situation but one containing some inherent truth - Kivitt and D'Antuono simply lacked the top tier presence that allowed dancers like Bruhn and Fracci to command a stage, rather than merely to dance upon it.  That said, it is nice to see Kivitt's and D'Antuono's genuine talents also preserved for posterity on this DVD.That's the good news. The bad news: the self-indulgent camera antics of a moron who thought that ballet lovers would really be interested in watching Erik Bruhn do one of his first-act variations from behind a jug instead of face on, or watching Carla Fracci's floating arms as a (poorly visible) reflection in a pool, all for the sake of ""atmosphere"".  The cameraman who did it, and the director who allowed it, should both be hanged.Well, nothing is perfect.  As ballet history alone, and as a record of legendary performers in roles they were justly famous for, this DVD is worth the price and the watching time.

Fracci's Giselle is legendary, and I was so looking forward to seeing her. But whoever shot and edited the film SHOULD have been shot. A dancer's body - ALL PARTS OF HER BODY - should be in the shot when she's dancing, and the shot should be at straight-on level, not overhead (or under-the-tutu, as it was for an unfortunate instant near the end of the second act). I know this ballet fairly well, and there is a part that I love in the second act, when Giselle does that series of small jumps that make her look weightless, then stays in place to do a series of little jumps-with-beats (I don't remember the terms). Fracci was doing that wonderfully well, when suddenly, in the middle of her footwork, the camera cuts to a FULL SCREEN OF JUST HER FEET DOING THE BEATS. That is a pet peeve of mine. Sorry.Then there were all the blurry bits, and the Wili-dancing we see only reflected in a pool of water (my theory is that they filmed a few steps, with one camera focused on the dancers and another on their reflection, so that later they could string the two bits together to make it look like one long dance sequence). And then in the first act, there were several inexplicable cuts to a barely-discernible face of someone of indeterminate sex, staring out at us with a coldly hostile expression on his/her face. It was like something out of ""The Ring."" I expected to get a phone call saying I had a week to live. My guess now was that it was the Queen of the Wilis, but it could have been someone who had wandered onto the set, for all I know.Oh, and I forgot to mention the horseback scene (as you may already have guessed, this movie was not a straight video recording of a ballet performance; someone tried to make a ""movie"" out of it, the way Baryshnikov did (successfully) with his production of ""The Nutcracker"".) All of Albrecht's entourage are riding horseback through the woods. We get an extended horse's behind view of them as they trot along. Unfortunately, the cameraman was apparently ALSO on horseback behind them with his camera, and the shot goes up and down and up and down with the motion of the horses until I actually started to feel motion sickness.But Fracci and Bruhn were so good. Lanchberry used to be the ABT orchestra's conductor back in the day, so it's not as if he didn't know that a ballet performance looks like. Maybe he spent so much time in the pit he figured that if he didn't need to see the dancers, nobody else did.So I'll be looking for more Fracci, but the pickings appear to be slim.But she's the Giselle they say she is, and more.",1,Awful camerawork mars what could have been a perfect Fracci and Bruhn performance,1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,2704,"['saw', 'name', 'Carla', 'Fracci', 'snapped', 'salmon', 'video.Now', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'feel', 'profoundly', 'ripped', 'off', 'Fracci', 'Giselle', 'legendary', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'whoever', 'shot', 'edited', 'film', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'dancer', 'body', 'PARTS', 'HER', 'BODY', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'when', 'dancing', 'shot', 'should', 'be', 'straight-on', 'level', 'not', 'overhead', 'under-the-tutu', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'instant', 'end', 'second', 'act', 'know', 'ballet', 'fairly', 'well', 'part', 'love', 'second', 'act', 'when', 'Giselle', 'series', 'small', 'jumps', 'make', 'look', 'weightless', 'then', 'place', 'do', 'series', 'little', 'jumps-with-beats', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'terms', 'Fracci', 'was', 'doing', 'wonderfully', 'well', 'when', 'suddenly', 'middle', 'footwork', 'camera', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'OF', 'JUST', 'HER', 'FEET', 'DOING', 'THE', 'BEATS', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'Sorry.Then', 'were', 'blurry', 'bits', 'Wili-dancing', 'see', 'only', 'reflected', 'pool', 'water', 'theory', 'filmed', 'few', 'steps', 'one', 'camera', 'focused', 'dancers', 'reflection', 'so', 'later', 'could', 'string', 'two', 'bits', 'together', 'make', 'look', 'one', 'long', 'dance', 'sequence', 'then', 'first', 'act', 'were', 'several', 'inexplicable', 'cuts', 'barely-discernible', 'face', 'someone', 'indeterminate', 'sex', 'staring', 'out', 'coldly', 'hostile', 'expression', 'his/her', 'face', 'was', 'something', 'Ring', 'expected', 'get', 'phone', 'call', 'saying', 'had', 'week', 'live', 'guess', 'now', 'was', 'was', 'Queen', 'Wilis', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'wandered', 'set', 'know.Oh', 'forgot', 'mention', 'horseback', 'scene', 'may', 'already', 'have', 'guessed', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'straight', 'video', 'recording', 'ballet', 'performance', 'someone', 'tried', 'make', 'movie', 'way', 'Baryshnikov', 'did', 'successfully', 'production', 'Nutcracker', 'Albrecht', 'entourage', 'are', 'riding', 'horseback', 'woods', 'get', 'extended', 'horse', 'view', 'trot', 'along', 'Unfortunately', 'cameraman', 'was', 'apparently', 'ALSO', 'horseback', 'camera', 'shot', 'up', 'down', 'up', 'down', 'motion', 'horses', 'actually', 'started', 'feel', 'motion', 'sickness.But', 'Fracci', 'Bruhn', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'Lanchberry', 'used', 'be', 'ABT', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'back', 'day', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'ballet', 'performance', 'Maybe', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'pit', 'figured', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'dancers', 'nobody', 'else', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'more', 'Fracci', 'pickings', 'appear', 'be', 'slim.But', 'Giselle', 'say', 'more']",N/A

A pity, because I've owned many Giselles over the years and whenever I come back to this one, I'm reminded of all the reasons Fracci remains my favorite.  She has an energy and charisma that is not matched by other ballerinas who have performed this.  That said, I rate Fracci 5*, the other principals and corps 4*, and the camerawork 2*.  That averages somewhere between 3 & 4.  For the best overall Giselle, combining youthful freshness, exquisite performances, direction and camerawork, my favorite is the La Scala version with Alessandra Ferri.",4,Fracci and Bruhn superb; camerawork and direction less so.,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,643,"['sympathize', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'artistic', 'excesses', 'filming', 'version', 'pity', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'many', 'Giselles', 'years', 'whenever', 'come', 'back', 'one', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'reasons', 'Fracci', 'favorite', 'energy', 'charisma', 'not', 'matched', 'other', 'ballerinas', 'who', 'have', 'performed', 'said', 'rate', 'Fracci', '5*', 'other', 'principals', 'corps', '4*', 'camerawork', '2*', 'somewhere', '3', '4', 'best', 'overall', 'Giselle', 'combining', 'youthful', 'freshness', 'exquisite', 'performances', 'direction', 'camerawork', 'favorite', 'La', 'Scala', 'version', 'Alessandra', 'Ferri']",N/A
904768,AOMEZP13H0MQC,B0009FU08S,Warmgoy,"[12, 13]","I was much looking forward to this release as I had never seen this, one of the most notable ballet films ever done.And ""ballet film"" is the operative phrase here; this is not so much a filmed ballet as it is a sort of ""Dance Cinema"", a re-imagining of the classic piece in cinematic terms. As such, it is replete with touches one would expect to see in a feature film - extreme close ups, reaction shots, unusual camera angles, and a focus on environmental ambiance. It is often very effective, but be prepared - the camera is the star here, not the choreography, and intermittently, well, you can't really see the people dance. The Act One peasant interlude is one example - though it appears to be very well performed, the dancers are shot here through the revolving mill wheel, there through the feathers of a noblewoman's hat, with director Niebling focusing a bit obessively on village folk eating fruit and gossiping, nobles drinking wine, and a little old man who appears to be the village monk crossing a bridge. It can become a bit wearing, and ironically in its attempt to break beynd the conventions of staged ballet, the film perhaps ignores some conventions that make ballet special to begin with. At times it is very effective however - Act Two responds particularly well to this approach. I personally like some of the camera work and reflections in the Willi/Hilarion episode; the Willi's homicidal stalking of the poor guy is truly threatening and scary, as it rarely is on stage. But here too, the approach may wallow in cinematic opportunity to some detriment; as Hilarion meets his fate we see the dancer's face whirling madly about, when we might want to see more of the footwork involved. Much of the work does feature full lengths shots, but here too, the camera could have been pulled back about four feet.HOWEVER, and this is a big however, the above should not be interpreted to disqualify a filmed interpretation that - when the viewer make the necessary expectational adjustment - presents a most effective musical/dramatic experience. The film may indulge itself here and there, but some of the shots are simply gorgeous, Myrtha's entrance for one is beautifully done, camera wise. The production is very beautiful, based on the ABT production of the time, though the film opens it up with exteriors and so on. Technical presentation is superb - despite the film's age, this is the most visually stunning GISELLE available at the moment. The picture quality is dazzlingly clear and the sound, with a choice of PCM Stereo or DTS 5.1 is excellent. Lanchbery diddles with the orchestration here and there, but effectively so, the textures are lush and enveloping, and the extension of the creepy Willi entrance music is justifiable in this filmed context.Oh yeah, some people get up and dance too. The film is of great historical value with its preservation of the Fracci/Bruhn partnership in this piece, even it is perhaps hell-bent on preserving it from the waist up. Fracci's Giselle is lovely (God, she is a beautiful woman), and charmingly unaffected and natural - one is never aware of this as a diva-turn, it is a nicely fleshed out assumption. The mad scene is really heartrending. Bruhn is a trifle stiff here and there, but is nicely in character and partners her well. Bruce Marks is one of the best Hilarions on DVD, and Toni Lander's technically impressive Myrtha is one cold, scary chick on tippy-toe. I have to say too, that I find the aerial shots of the Willi scenes very effective, looking down as they do on the circle of death created by the spirits, an effect only possible with film. In moments like this, the film is really stunningly beautiful.I would definitly go for this one, with the understanding that this is very much a GISELLE for camera. People who want a more straightforward, staged presentation may be annoyed, but if you are able to accept the film in film terms (and perhaps accept that the opportunities the medium provides are a trifle over-exploited here) you will love this DVD. I do.I need to shut up, but here is the bottom line. If you want a staged production preserved on DVD, go for the Scala/Ferri. If you prefer a studio presentation, this is definitly the one to have. The two complement each other very well, so skip lunch this week and get them both.",4,"A Visually Beautiful, Artistically Satisfying GISELLE For Film",1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,4330,"['was', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'most', 'notable', 'ballet', 'films', 'ever', 'done.And', 'ballet', 'film', 'operative', 'phrase', 'here', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'filmed', 'ballet', 'sort', 'Dance', 'Cinema', 're-imagining', 'classic', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'terms', 'such', 'replete', 'touches', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'feature', 'film', 'extreme', 'close', 'ups', 'reaction', 'shots', 'unusual', 'camera', 'angles', 'focus', 'environmental', 'ambiance', 'often', 'very', 'effective', 'be', 'prepared', 'camera', 'star', 'here', 'not', 'choreography', 'intermittently', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'people', 'dance', 'Act', 'One', 'peasant', 'interlude', 'one', 'example', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'performed', 'dancers', 'are', 'shot', 'here', 'revolving', 'mill', 'wheel', 'feathers', 'noblewoman', 'hat', 'director', 'Niebling', 'focusing', 'bit', 'obessively', 'village', 'folk', 'eating', 'fruit', 'gossiping', 'nobles', 'drinking', 'wine', 'little', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'village', 'monk', 'crossing', 'bridge', 'can', 'become', 'bit', 'wearing', 'ironically', 'attempt', 'break', 'beynd', 'conventions', 'staged', 'ballet', 'film', 'perhaps', 'conventions', 'make', 'ballet', 'special', 'begin', 'times', 'very', 'effective', 'however', 'Act', 'Two', 'particularly', 'well', 'approach', 'personally', 'camera', 'work', 'reflections', 'Willi/Hilarion', 'episode', 'Willi', 'homicidal', 'stalking', 'poor', 'guy', 'truly', 'threatening', 'scary', 'rarely', 'stage', 'here', 'too', 'approach', 'may', 'wallow', 'cinematic', 'opportunity', 'detriment', 'Hilarion', 'fate', 'see', 'dancer', 'face', 'whirling', 'madly', 'about', 'when', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'footwork', 'involved', 'Much', 'work', 'feature', 'full', 'lengths', 'shots', 'here', 'too', 'camera', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'back', 'four', 'feet.HOWEVER', 'big', 'however', 'above', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'interpreted', 'disqualify', 'filmed', 'interpretation', 'when', 'viewer', 'make', 'necessary', 'expectational', 'adjustment', 'most', 'effective', 'musical/dramatic', 'experience', 'film', 'may', 'indulge', 'here', 'there', 'shots', 'are', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'Myrtha', 'entrance', 'one', 'beautifully', 'done', 'camera', 'wise', 'production', 'very', 'beautiful', 'based', 'ABT', 'production', 'time', 'film', 'up', 'exteriors', 'so', 'Technical', 'presentation', 'superb', 'film', 'age', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'GISELLE', 'available', 'moment', 'picture', 'quality', 'dazzlingly', 'clear', 'sound', 'choice', 'PCM', 'Stereo', 'DTS', '5.1', 'excellent', 'Lanchbery', 'orchestration', 'here', 'there', 'effectively', 'so', 'textures', 'are', 'lush', 'enveloping', 'extension', 'creepy', 'Willi', 'entrance', 'music', 'justifiable', 'filmed', 'context.Oh', 'yeah', 'people', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'too', 'film', 'great', 'historical', 'value', 'preservation', 'Fracci/Bruhn', 'partnership', 'piece', 'even', 'perhaps', 'hell-bent', 'preserving', 'waist', 'up', 'Fracci', 'Giselle', 'lovely', 'God', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'charmingly', 'unaffected', 'natural', 'one', 'never', 'aware', 'diva-turn', 'nicely', 'fleshed', 'out', 'assumption', 'mad', 'scene', 'really', 'heartrending', 'Bruhn', 'trifle', 'stiff', 'here', 'there', 'nicely', 'character', 'partners', 'well', 'Bruce', 'Marks', 'one', 'best', 'Hilarions', 'DVD', 'Toni', 'Lander', 'technically', 'impressive', 'Myrtha', 'one', 'cold', 'scary', 'chick', 'tippy-toe', 'have', 'say', 'too', 'find', 'aerial', 'shots', 'Willi', 'scenes', 'very', 'effective', 'looking', 'down', 'do', 'circle', 'death', 'created', 'spirits', 'effect', 'only', 'possible', 'film', 'moments', 'film', 'really', 'stunningly', 'beautiful.I', 'would', 'definitly', 'go', 'one', 'understanding', 'very', 'much', 'GISELLE', 'camera', 'People', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'straightforward', 'staged', 'presentation', 'may', 'be', 'annoyed', 'are', 'able', 'accept', 'film', 'film', 'terms', 'perhaps', 'accept', 'opportunities', 'medium', 'are', 'trifle', 'over-exploited', 'here', 'will', 'love', 'DVD', 'do.I', 'need', 'shut', 'up', 'here', 'bottom', 'line', 'want', 'staged', 'production', 'preserved', 'DVD', 'go', 'Scala/Ferri', 'prefer', 'studio', 'presentation', 'definitly', 'one', 'have', 'two', 'complement', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'skip', 'lunch', 'week', 'get']",N/A
