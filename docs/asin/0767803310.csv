7303,AO4A961ZKHJPL,0767803310,"Enrique Torres ""Rico""","[14, 14]","Federico Luppi, the fine actor from Argentina, takes the lead role as Dr. Fuentes.  He sets out to find his former students on the road to places he's never been. The shift in his life is caused by the death of his wife. He sets out in spite of his family not wanting him to leave. The aging doctor first encounters one his former students, now a drug dealer, using the same drugs he taught him to cure others, he is now using them for ill purposes. His journey has only begun and he finds many more dissapointments along the way. This is a beautiful film that is allegorical, historical, contemporary  and packed with messages for the viewer to interpret. In his quest to find his students he finds his country to be quite different from the view he had of it prior to his leaving the city. He encounters missing people  and tales of abductions from men with guns. The villagers call them white men with guns but are quick to say that the Indios are also now white men. Although the story takes place in an unnamed country, the parallels to Guatemala are clear. Having witnessed a corpse on the roadside while travelling in a bus (everyone gawked with little concern, as though it were a common sight) in Guatemala and seeing the treatment first hand of the military I am pretty sure this is where it is. However, this is unimportant as these occurences of hit squads and paramilitary goons, in cahoots with the military, are a frequent sight in many Latin American countries. Anyway, Dr. Fuentes picks up several people along the way to expand the tale. He picks up a ""liberation priest"" who abandons his collar and those who believed in him, a former military thug turned thief, an indigenous young woman who doesn't speak since she was raped by soldiers and a street-savy kid who is an orphan and Dr. Fuentes's guide. All represent the society Dr. Fuentes is unaware of and  as they tell their sordid stories, amidst flashbacks  and surreal dreams, a country whose people live in brutal chaos is revealed . This is a powerful movie, one to be seen more than once in order to fully enjoy. Although the story evolves around Dr. Fuentes and his crew,  there are several encounters with a funny couple who are ""informed"" tourists with bad Spanish accents  and worse pronunciation. A completly enthralling film, in spite of its length, that hits close to the harsh reality of life in Latin America. A beautiful film  that is set to the backdrops of the jungle and it's  relics from the past, as well as present day village life , it is a movie that is visually breathtaking and mentally stimulating. Recommended for those that like movies that carry a political and social commentary. Great stuff, see it before your next vacation to the tropics, so that as the guy from the radio says""and now you know the rest of the story"" before you get there.",4,Powerful,1046736000,"03 4, 2003",2003,2846,"['Federico', 'Luppi', 'fine', 'actor', 'Argentina', 'lead', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Fuentes', 'out', 'find', 'former', 'students', 'road', 'places', 'never', 'been', 'shift', 'life', 'caused', 'death', 'wife', 'out', 'spite', 'family', 'not', 'wanting', 'leave', 'aging', 'doctor', 'first', 'one', 'former', 'students', 'now', 'drug', 'dealer', 'using', 'same', 'drugs', 'taught', 'cure', 'others', 'now', 'using', 'ill', 'purposes', 'journey', 'only', 'begun', 'many', 'more', 'dissapointments', 'way', 'beautiful', 'film', 'allegorical', 'historical', 'contemporary', 'packed', 'messages', 'viewer', 'interpret', 'quest', 'find', 'students', 'country', 'be', 'quite', 'different', 'view', 'had', 'leaving', 'city', 'missing', 'people', 'tales', 'abductions', 'men', 'guns', 'villagers', 'call', 'white', 'men', 'guns', 'are', 'quick', 'say', 'Indios', 'are', 'also', 'now', 'white', 'men', 'story', 'place', 'unnamed', 'country', 'parallels', 'Guatemala', 'are', 'clear', 'Having', 'witnessed', 'corpse', 'roadside', 'travelling', 'bus', 'everyone', 'gawked', 'little', 'concern', 'were', 'common', 'sight', 'Guatemala', 'seeing', 'treatment', 'first', 'hand', 'military', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'where', 'However', 'unimportant', 'occurences', 'hit', 'squads', 'paramilitary', 'goons', 'cahoots', 'military', 'are', 'frequent', 'sight', 'many', 'Latin', 'American', 'countries', 'Anyway', 'Dr.', 'Fuentes', 'up', 'several', 'people', 'way', 'expand', 'tale', 'up', 'liberation', 'priest', 'who', 'collar', 'who', 'believed', 'former', 'military', 'thug', 'turned', 'thief', 'indigenous', 'young', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'was', 'raped', 'soldiers', 'street-savy', 'kid', 'who', 'orphan', 'Dr.', 'Fuentes', 'guide', 'represent', 'society', 'Dr.', 'Fuentes', 'unaware', 'tell', 'sordid', 'stories', 'amidst', 'flashbacks', 'surreal', 'dreams', 'country', 'people', 'live', 'brutal', 'chaos', 'revealed', 'powerful', 'movie', 'one', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'order', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'story', 'around', 'Dr.', 'Fuentes', 'crew', 'are', 'several', 'encounters', 'funny', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'informed', 'tourists', 'bad', 'Spanish', 'accents', 'worse', 'pronunciation', 'completly', 'enthralling', 'film', 'spite', 'length', 'close', 'harsh', 'reality', 'life', 'Latin', 'America', 'beautiful', 'film', 'set', 'backdrops', 'jungle', 'relics', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'present', 'day', 'village', 'life', 'movie', 'visually', 'breathtaking', 'mentally', 'stimulating', 'Recommended', 'like', 'movies', 'carry', 'political', 'social', 'commentary', 'Great', 'stuff', 'see', 'next', 'vacation', 'tropics', 'so', 'guy', 'radio', 'now', 'know', 'rest', 'story', 'get', 'there']",Men With Guns VHS

Students that he trained to help the poorer people of his country. However, he soon discovers that something is wrong. His students are missing, and the only explanation he can gather about them is that somehow ""Men with Guns"" were involved. What starts as a vacation soon turns into a quest. Soon more charachters join him, including an orphan boy, an awol solidier, an ex-priest (my favorite) and a mute woman. All of which leads to the ending. No hollywood fairytales here.

7306,A2U8LADYTA9SXQ,0767803310,"J. Christmas ""joshua-one""","[8, 8]","This is a wonderful movie.  A beautiful story is interwoven with complex  ideas about religion, death, politics, and &quot;might makes right&quot;  philosophy.I just want to point out that contrary to what a few  reviewers said, this movie clearly did not take place in Mexico.  Doctor  Fuentes specifically says, in one scene, that Mexico is North of where they  are.  What country it takes place in is not possible to determine, and this  seems deliberate to me.",5,"excellent, but (contrary to above) not in mexico",965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,464,"['wonderful', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'story', 'interwoven', 'complex', 'ideas', 'religion', 'death', 'politics', 'quot', 'might', 'right', 'quot', 'just', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'contrary', 'what', 'few', 'reviewers', 'said', 'movie', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'Mexico', 'Doctor', 'Fuentes', 'specifically', 'one', 'scene', 'Mexico', 'North', 'where', 'are', 'What', 'country', 'place', 'not', 'possible', 'determine', 'deliberate']",Men With Guns VHS
7307,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0767803310,Linda Linguvic,"[35, 37]","This movie grapples with some serious issues.  What, exactly is going on politically in South America?  Where does individual responsibility lie? What does helping people really mean?  What kind of legacy is it possible to leave?  The setting of this movie is an unnamed country in South America. The writer/director, John Sayles, did this on purpose.  This is to show that the kind of thing depicted in the movie could happen anywhere.  However, it was shot in Mexico, in Spanish, with English subtitles.The movie starts Federico Luppi as Dr. Humberto Fuentes, a wealthy doctor who is approaching retirement and has never paid close attention to the realities of his country.  His greatest achievement, the &quot;legacy&quot; he is leaving, is his participation in an international health program in which he trained young doctors to work in the poorest of villages.I watched this movie with horror and then, finally, resignation, as Dr. Fuentes travels in the mountains and makes startling discoveries.  I made a few startling discoveries myself -- the abject poverty of the people, the disregard for human life, the acceptance by the people of this as a way of life.  He finds that the people have no food.  He finds that both the army and the guerillas are equally brutal.  The movie takes us all on a journey with Dr. Fuentes.  Along the way we meet a homeless child, a priest who lives with his own private demons, and a deserter from the army with a history of participating in the carnage.  The movie goes deeper and deeper into the despair and devastation.This is not a comfortable video to watch as it brings the viewer not only into the realities of the political systems in South America, but to the basic question of individual responsibility.  I recommend it for those who are willing to take a fresh look at these things.  You will not be smilling after viewing this video.  But you will be thinking.",5,A haunting video that will leave you thinking ...,975110400,"11 25, 2000",2000,1915,"['movie', 'serious', 'issues', 'What', 'exactly', 'going', 'politically', 'South', 'America', 'Where', 'individual', 'responsibility', 'lie', 'What', 'helping', 'people', 'really', 'mean', 'What', 'kind', 'legacy', 'possible', 'leave', 'setting', 'movie', 'unnamed', 'country', 'South', 'America', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Sayles', 'did', 'purpose', 'show', 'kind', 'thing', 'depicted', 'movie', 'could', 'happen', 'anywhere', 'However', 'was', 'shot', 'Mexico', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles.The', 'movie', 'Federico', 'Luppi', 'Dr.', 'Humberto', 'Fuentes', 'wealthy', 'doctor', 'who', 'approaching', 'retirement', 'never', 'paid', 'close', 'attention', 'realities', 'country', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'quot', 'legacy', 'quot', 'leaving', 'participation', 'international', 'health', 'program', 'trained', 'young', 'doctors', 'work', 'poorest', 'villages.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'horror', 'then', 'finally', 'resignation', 'Dr.', 'Fuentes', 'travels', 'mountains', 'startling', 'discoveries', 'made', 'few', 'startling', 'discoveries', 'abject', 'poverty', 'people', 'disregard', 'human', 'life', 'acceptance', 'people', 'way', 'life', 'people', 'have', 'food', 'army', 'guerillas', 'are', 'equally', 'brutal', 'movie', 'journey', 'Dr.', 'Fuentes', 'way', 'meet', 'homeless', 'child', 'priest', 'who', 'own', 'private', 'demons', 'deserter', 'army', 'history', 'participating', 'carnage', 'movie', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'despair', 'devastation.This', 'not', 'comfortable', 'video', 'watch', 'viewer', 'not', 'only', 'realities', 'political', 'systems', 'South', 'America', 'basic', 'question', 'individual', 'responsibility', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'take', 'fresh', 'look', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'smilling', 'viewing', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'thinking']",Men With Guns VHS
7308,A1TUDEC66M9FO3,0767803310,Preston C. Enright,"[8, 13]","As the Peruvian's review indicates, there are certainly Latin Americans who don't want to face part of their political reality, just as there are US citizens who like to deny or rationalize the violence of the United States of North America.  The ""Indian Wars"" of the US empire continue as this film on the oppression of Guatemalan Mayan Indians reveals.  While President Clinton did offer a near-apology for our decades of funding and organizing Guatemala's dirty war that killed 200,000 people, our corporatocracy continues to exploit the region and to wage economic warfare via NAFTA, CAFTA and the World Bank.""Men With Guns"" beautifully shows all who care the sort of brutal madness that has been taking place in Central America.  I've shared this film with Guatemalan immigrants I know, and they confirm the suffering they endured at the hands of our proxy forces.  These US taxpayer funded troops wiped out Guatemalan villages in the same way the Nazis wiped out Russian villages.  It's such a disgrace that it happened, and that so few Americans know about it.  This film offers us a tool to raise awareness, and civic groups like Global Exchange and Madre offer us opportunities to act in solidarity with the victims of US foreign policy.I'd also recommend books by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Rigoberta Menchu (who, predictably, had a Yale professor conduct a campaign to cast doubt on her credibility - a standard psy-op tactic of our military establishment) and the DVD documentary, ""When the Mountains Tremble.""Also see ""Guatemala: Never Again!"", the official report of the human rights office of the archdiocese of Guatemala.
