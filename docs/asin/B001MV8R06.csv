It's hard to believe that anyone let alone someone as healthy looking as Doris Day would be spooked by someone calling her up promising to kill her SOON.  And I doubt that she would be driven to hysteria at the idea that no one believes her or that her husband is busy at work because the marital dialogue is very mature and reasonable.It's nice to see the London backdrop as a time capsule of the era.",4,FUN but not believable in this day and age,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,571,"['set', 'design', 'pleasantly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Doris', 'Day', 'solid', 'performer', 'supported', 'talented', 'actors', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'hard', 'believe', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'someone', 'healthy', 'looking', 'Doris', 'Day', 'would', 'be', 'spooked', 'someone', 'calling', 'up', 'promising', 'kill', 'SOON', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'driven', 'hysteria', 'idea', 'one', 'husband', 'busy', 'work', 'marital', 'dialogue', 'very', 'mature', 'reasonable.It', 'nice', 'see', 'London', 'backdrop', 'time', 'capsule', 'era']",N/A

1217654,A2UP5W1BHNXMOD,B001MV8R06,Ter,"[12, 12]","Doris Day was probably one of the most underrated of actresses.  Because she was such a cheery, bubbly person, during the studio days they kept putting her into light frothy comedies---a rare exception being this film.  In this movie Doris Day plays Kit Preston and Rex Harrison her husband of three months, Tony.  These two have fabulous chemistry, the sets are gorgeous---I'd LOVE to have their London flat---they all wear astonishingly beautiful clothes...I could go on and on.  The script is intelligent and the co-stars fantastic.  Roddy McDowall, one of my favorite actors, plays a slimy son and does it to perfection.  John Gavin, one of the most beautiful males I ever saw in my life, plays the construction foreman who saves Kit twice, and his performance is both tender and protective.  Herbert Marshall, a really good character actor, is also in this film and he's excellent, as always.  And Myrna Loy is both stunning to look at and pitch perfect as Kit's Aunt Bea.  She can do more with her eyebrows and voice to get a subtle point across better than any other actress I've ever seen.  I honestly didn't see the twist ending coming at all, and I love movies like that, that set you in one direction to totally turn you around at the end.For a long time I've owned the VHS version of this fabulous film and I've been hunting for the DVD version for years.  I almost didn't buy this because although it claimed to be for all regions I found that difficult to believe.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it worked fine in my DVD player (I'm an American).  The outside packaging is in Portuguese.  There are Portuguese subtitles, but you can turn the them off in the main menu.  The movie is in English and refreshingly uncut.  The only thing better would be to have completely restored the movie, as in my opinion it's one of the very best I have ever seen.",5,FINALLY - a really great movie on DVD,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,1878,"['Doris', 'Day', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actresses', 'was', 'such', 'cheery', 'bubbly', 'person', 'studio', 'days', 'kept', 'putting', 'light', 'frothy', 'comedies', '-a', 'rare', 'exception', 'being', 'film', 'movie', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Kit', 'Preston', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'husband', 'three', 'months', 'Tony', 'two', 'have', 'fabulous', 'chemistry', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', '-I', ""'d"", 'LOVE', 'have', 'London', 'flat', '-they', 'wear', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'clothes', 'could', 'go', 'script', 'intelligent', 'co-stars', 'fantastic', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'slimy', 'son', 'perfection', 'John', 'Gavin', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'males', 'ever', 'saw', 'life', 'construction', 'foreman', 'who', 'Kit', 'twice', 'performance', 'tender', 'protective', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'really', 'good', 'character', 'actor', 'also', 'film', 'excellent', 'always', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'stunning', 'look', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Kit', 'Aunt', 'Bea', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'eyebrows', 'voice', 'get', 'subtle', 'point', 'better', 'other', 'actress', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'twist', 'ending', 'coming', 'love', 'movies', 'set', 'one', 'direction', 'totally', 'turn', 'around', 'end.For', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'VHS', 'version', 'fabulous', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hunting', 'DVD', 'version', 'years', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'claimed', 'be', 'regions', 'found', 'difficult', 'believe', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'worked', 'fine', 'DVD', 'player', ""'m"", 'American', 'outside', 'packaging', 'Portuguese', 'are', 'Portuguese', 'subtitles', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'main', 'menu', 'movie', 'English', 'refreshingly', 'uncut', 'only', 'thing', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'completely', 'restored', 'movie', 'opinion', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",N/A
