They both love it and want to see it over and over. Cute songs, cute dances, little skits--I like it too! It engages them with interactive dances and responses, unlike the much lamer later shows that are nothing more than spliced together music videos.",5,Great Wiggles DVD,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,379,"['love', 'Big', 'Red', 'Boat', 'CD', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'try', 'out', 'show', 'got', 'almost-2', 'almost-5', 'year', 'old', 'love', 'want', 'see', 'over', 'Cute', 'songs', 'cute', 'dances', 'little', 'skits', 'too', 'interactive', 'dances', 'responses', 'much', 'lamer', 'later', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'spliced', 'together', 'music', 'videos']",N/A

Someone mentioned below that these guys travel extensively and make a ton of money doing that.  Guess what? That ISN'T where the money is in the music biz.  It's right here in the produced effect.  Besides, touring stinks, let me tell you from experience, and a totally horrific way to make a living.  But, when you sign your name on the dotted line at the record companies, they own you and you have to do it.  If you're disgusted with this DVD, then blame good old Hit Entertainment.  They're your cash cow.  The touring, producing, recording and writing schedule these guys keep is absolutely insane.  No recored company should be doing what Hit does to these guys.  So, give the Wiggles a break.  It's all about the money for the record companies and they really don't give a flying finger about why the artist made it big in the first place.  Unfortunately, I was hoping this wouldn't happen to the Wiggles but with their schedule, you just can't do everything.  This DVD isn't that bad.  It's good for the folks new to their music because quite frankly, Dance Party is REALLY old.  Greg's only about 21 there!  It needed to be redone because the songs are pretty cute.  Don't worry, after a year off I'm sure they'll be back in full form.  If you've ever lived a life like that you'd definitely need a break now and then and that's what these ""greatest hits"" albums do.  They provide income for the label and a break for the artist.  Hang in there all you Wiggle fans, they'll be back in full force for the next one!  And, I definitely recommend this DVD!",5,Great CD for a Greatest Hits,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,1699,"['Well', 'judging', 'other', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'should', 'stink', 'Has', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'there', 'ever', 'heard', 'greatest', 'hits', 'DVD', 'CD', 'Someone', 'mentioned', 'guys', 'travel', 'extensively', 'make', 'ton', 'money', 'doing', 'Guess', 'what', ""N'T"", 'where', 'money', 'music', 'biz', 'right', 'here', 'produced', 'effect', 'touring', 'stinks', 'let', 'tell', 'experience', 'totally', 'horrific', 'way', 'make', 'living', 'when', 'sign', 'name', 'dotted', 'line', 'record', 'companies', 'own', 'have', 'do', ""'re"", 'disgusted', 'DVD', 'then', 'blame', 'good', 'old', 'Hit', 'Entertainment', ""'re"", 'cash', 'cow', 'touring', 'producing', 'recording', 'writing', 'schedule', 'guys', 'keep', 'absolutely', 'insane', 'recored', 'company', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'what', 'Hit', 'guys', 'So', 'give', 'Wiggles', 'break', 'money', 'record', 'companies', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'flying', 'finger', 'why', 'artist', 'made', 'big', 'first', 'place', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Wiggles', 'schedule', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'bad', 'good', 'folks', 'new', 'music', 'quite', 'frankly', 'Dance', 'Party', 'REALLY', 'old', 'Greg', 'only', 'about', '21', 'there', 'needed', 'be', 'redone', 'songs', 'are', 'pretty', 'cute', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'year', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'full', 'form', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'lived', 'life', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'need', 'break', 'now', 'then', 'what', 'greatest', 'hits', 'albums', 'do', 'provide', 'income', 'label', 'break', 'artist', 'Hang', 'Wiggle', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'full', 'force', 'next', 'one', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

But, I HATED that fact that they didn't have any children dancing to the songs as they sange.  They have the Wiggle dancers (Leeanne, and the rest of the adults).  We enjoy the Wiggles, but we enjoy watching the children dance and perform when they sing.  I was very disappointed.  My favorite Wiggle DVD is the Live Concert one.  We watch that one all the time.

I borrowed Big Red Car from the library today and it will be going back tomorrow. I once owned Sailing Around the World, but do not have it anymore. Let's just say I did not give it away to anyone else. At least half of the Big Red Car feature is composed of songs and skits by the Captain and his crew, very much like SATW, and those segments are just irritating. This gets 2 stars only because the first few songs actually feature the guys themselves with many songs we don't have already on our other DVDs.
