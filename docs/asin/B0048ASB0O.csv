Unfortunately, teachers are getting the shaft too because not only are they used and abused by the administrators who are raking in all the bucks while the teachers do the work, but the teacher unions who are supposed to be protecting the teachers are also partly to blame for the problem.  I live in GA, however, where there are no unions and teachers are treated like slave labor.  All of the good ones get frustrated and burned out.  The administration is meanwhile bloated and a bunch of fat cats stealing money from their own communities.  I like the index of counting how many expensive cars you see at the county office parking lot as a measure of how bad a school system.  The sad thing is that only a fraction of the money spent on education every makes it to the teachers or kids who are the primary actors in the system.

1389128,A1AYJY5NBGHPEW,B0048ASB0O,Henry Cate III,"[2, 7]","The year 2010 had several documentaries on public education.  They ranged from being mildly condemning to very harsh against the public education system.  ""The Cartel"" hammered the government schools in New Jersey.  My wife and I watched this awhile back and thought it was well done.Bob Bowdon, the producer, opens with some scary statistics:  Some 37% of high school seniors are reading at eighth grade level.  A third of high school students drop out.  While the US is tops in spending, we do poorly against much of the rest of the world in how much children learn.The movie makes the point that tons of money is poured into public schools, but little of it reaches the classroom.  For example when you divide the total amount of money by the number of classrooms you get between $300,000 and $440,000 per classroom, depending on the school district.  But typically only $55,000 is spent on the teacher's salary.  There is little oversight.  Often janitors are making more than the teachers.  One audit showed that almost a third of the money was wasted.  Part of the problem is school boards are very free with taxpayer money.  And even worse than janitors the administrators have high salaries and great benefits.Recently New Jersey cut the state budget but was still able to increase school budgets.  Unfortunately over a billion dollars got lost in school construction.  It was completely unaccounted for. The movie went on to share more stories of corruption.  For example there where ghost salaries to people who didn't exist.Because of unions it has become virtually impossible to fire teachers, especially once a teacher has tenure.  Unions always fight for the teachers and the students suffer.Lots of school boards hold elections on off days because they will get a low turnout and thus have a better chance of influencing who ends up on the school board.Bob Bowdon concludes with a call for vouchers and charter schools.  By giving parents more options and greater power the government schools will have to improve, or die.While the movie is a bit depressing with the constant shock of problem after problem with public schools, I felt it was worth watching.

1389137,A3OIOJUQSNX4XG,B0048ASB0O,"Skip Stone ""The Rock""","[6, 12]","I work in a district in Arizona that pays its starting teachers 30K per year.  After 15 years teachers make 60K per year.  To receive the 60K per year all teachers must have at least a master's degree.  Compare this to a district beside us that pays their top teachers 44K per year and it seems like an acceptable salary.  Now compare other professional who have master's degrees to teachers.  When you do this it becomes obvious that teachers are making very low salaries.  At least for the level of education they have earned.In Arizona we have virtually no Unions.  The Unions that exist are puppet organization that do nothing and have very few members.  At the low income, inner city school I work at, I see teachers fired all the time. By law, there is no tenure for anyone.  You had better be a great teacher or you are gone.  In the high school I work at this will happen to at least five teachers a year.  Others will leave because of the low pay and 60 hour work week it takes to be a great teacher.  Our school is ranked in the top 5% of schools in the USA by US News and World Report.  We also received the College Board District of the Year for AP (Advanced Placement - university level classes).  Now the big question is how much does it cost?  Well Arizona is the 3rd lowest in per pupil spending in the US.  We are in the bottom 6% in money spent on education.  The school I work at is the perfect model for what America wants.  It's like shopping at Bloomingdales with Wal-Mart prices.  Unfortunately there is a big problem.  Over the last 15 years I have been in education I have seen a change in teacher's attitudes.  Teachers are expected to be like religious zealots that will work themselves to death for nothing.  We don't ask our attorneys and doctors to do this so why do we ask our teachers to live a life of sub-professional pay?  The problem is the great teachers are getting fed up with the garbage propaganda that films like this spew forth, and they are leaving the profession.  Giving up on Americas children, and giving up on America.  It's a screw it, let Rome burn attitude.In my life I have owned a trucking company with 40 employees, I worked as an engineer for 11 years, I was a teacher for 15 years, and I am now a school counselor.  The reality is that being a teacher was harder than being a CEO of a company, an engineer and a counselor all rolled together.  If you have never been a teacher, you haven't a clue about how hard a job it is.  Teachers are a society's greatest asset.  Ask the people of Finland who pay their teachers 150K US dollars a year and treat their teachers with respect.  Finland is #1 in the world in education.  Or go north to Canada where teachers are paid between 100k and 150k US dollars per year.  Again Canada beats us in education.  This film talks about the US spending more than anyone and then admits that teachers are receiving only a small percentage of the money.  BINGO!  There is one of the two biggest problems with education in America.  So increase pay to teacher.  Pay them like the professionals they are.  DO IT NOW and you will see results!  The second biggest problem is not Unions, but rather a society in decline; parents working two jobs, disrespectful children, poverty, and the list go on.  Unfortunately the teachers can do nothing about the second biggest problem.  In fact, it is this second problem that means we really need to pay more to get great teachers.  Other things such as manageable class sizes, updating technology, administration, overhead, over powered unions, etc. are all things that must be addressed.  Some will require more funding, others will require less funding.  This is the greatest nation on earth; now let's start acting like it.  We have a complex problem, so let's fix it.  Just remember, the Boston Tea Party was not about getting rid of taxes, it was about taxation without representation.  Bostonians wanted their taxes to stay in America to build roads and schools that would make this country great.  They were not against paying taxes.  Many states may be able to cut taxes while others may have to increase taxes.  In the meantime, pay teacher's professional wages so that while the squabbling over other spending goes on, at least our children will be getting a better education than they are today.

The problems highlighted might be a bit more extreme in New Jersey, but the ""education unions"" are equally as powerful and disinterested in the children in other states. California would provide sufficient data to provide a second volume! Alas, Nepotism and unethical practices are ubiquitous in all ""big"" government.The focus of the documentary is on what is wrong verses to how to fix what is wrong. However, based on the depth and breath of the corruption; it is sadly clear that parents will have to by-pass the entire government based educational system to ensure their kids can read and write.  In the 1990s many parents we knew had transitioned to homeschooling, this trend has continued. The Church based school systems, as noted in the film, are the best way for parents to provide the necessary foundation for their children: education reading and writing coupled with expectations of moral behavior.  At the end of the day, we voters just have to say ""no"" to all tax increases.  It is clear the money goes everywhere else but to the teacher and the class room.This is by far the best documentary I have seen in years! Outstanding.",5,Have children?

1389139,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B0048ASB0O,Sylviastel,"[12, 19]","There have been other documentaries about the failing public education system. Bob Bowdon is a New Jersey resident, journalist, and investigative reporter in the state. This documentary chronicles and tries to explain a far balance of charter schools, public schools, the money, the politics, and why the education system appears to be failing our kids. Well, he went to the Board of Education in Jersey City (the state's second largest city) and found a lot of nice, brand new cars in the parking lot of the offices. Ironically, Jersey City has some of the best public transportation including the PATH and Light-Rail and a Bus system in the state.The superintendents are making a fortune off the students who really don't see the money. There is too many districts (over 600 alone in the state) with superintendents earning under $200,000 a year. Of course, they complain that they don't make enough money. People who work in the lowest positions such as secretarial and custodial positions might have steady jobs with benefits but they are lowly paid and expected to work 12 months a year.Bob's documentary is a worthy effort although it reminds me of a NJN documentary about the state. He talks to the head of the NJEA, Bob Ingle (author of the Soprano State), and countless others including parents, teachers, board members, students, and others.I think what I remember most is the Camden story. The violence in the 2 Camden High Schools is unbelievable to influence kids to risk their lives to obtain an education. We don't see that story very much on the local stations in central Jersey. Anyway, a group of volunteers worked together to help the Camden students graduate high school in the basement of a church. In fact, Camden is so bad that the freshman high school students account the majority of students because of the high dropout rate.Now not all Charter Schools are stellar as you are led to believe. Charter Schools are usually not unionized. Because there is no third party, charter schools can fire and hire anybody.Charter Schools have their own issues to work out particularly those to help students. If you have an environment where teachers come and go, your students will never adjust to a routine and disciplined to learn. Charter Schools have to be unionize as well as the public schools. Teachers and staff at the Charter Schools need support.Most of the charter school teachers and staff don't aspire to remain in the charter school system. They aspire to the public school system. Almost all of the teachers who left the school I was at went into the public school and never looked back. In fact, the public school system offers a stable environment for students and staff alike.Remember Charter Schools aren't built, they are leased. They don't always last. In fact, they could shut down tomorrow if the state decides to revoke it's charter. What happens to those students and staff? Where do they go?The Charter School system has a psychological issue regarding it's survival among faculty and students and their parents.That's another thing about the education system. At least this documentary doesn't blame the teachers as much for failure as the system itself. That's why the documentary is fair and more balanced than others out there.",4,Objective and Fair About New Jersey Education!,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,3272,"['have', 'been', 'other', 'documentaries', 'failing', 'public', 'education', 'system', 'Bob', 'Bowdon', 'New', 'Jersey', 'resident', 'journalist', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'state', 'documentary', 'chronicles', 'tries', 'explain', 'far', 'balance', 'charter', 'schools', 'public', 'schools', 'money', 'politics', 'why', 'education', 'system', 'be', 'failing', 'kids', 'Well', 'went', 'Board', 'Education', 'Jersey', 'City', 'state', 'second', 'largest', 'city', 'found', 'lot', 'nice', 'brand', 'new', 'cars', 'parking', 'lot', 'offices', 'Ironically', 'Jersey', 'City', 'best', 'public', 'transportation', 'including', 'PATH', 'Light-Rail', 'Bus', 'system', 'state.The', 'superintendents', 'are', 'making', 'fortune', 'students', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'money', 'too', 'many', 'districts', '600', 'alone', 'state', 'superintendents', 'earning', '200,000', 'year', 'course', 'complain', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'People', 'who', 'work', 'lowest', 'positions', 'such', 'secretarial', 'custodial', 'positions', 'might', 'have', 'steady', 'jobs', 'benefits', 'are', 'lowly', 'paid', 'expected', 'work', '12', 'months', 'year.Bob', 'documentary', 'worthy', 'effort', 'NJN', 'documentary', 'state', 'head', 'NJEA', 'Bob', 'Ingle', 'author', 'Soprano', 'State', 'countless', 'others', 'including', 'parents', 'teachers', 'board', 'members', 'students', 'others.I', 'think', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'Camden', 'story', 'violence', '2', 'Camden', 'High', 'Schools', 'unbelievable', 'influence', 'kids', 'risk', 'lives', 'obtain', 'education', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'local', 'stations', 'central', 'Jersey', 'Anyway', 'group', 'volunteers', 'worked', 'together', 'help', 'Camden', 'students', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'basement', 'church', 'fact', 'Camden', 'so', 'bad', 'freshman', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'account', 'majority', 'students', 'high', 'dropout', 'rate.Now', 'not', 'Charter', 'Schools', 'are', 'stellar', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Charter', 'Schools', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'unionized', 'third', 'party', 'charter', 'schools', 'can', 'fire', 'hire', 'anybody.Charter', 'Schools', 'have', 'own', 'issues', 'work', 'out', 'particularly', 'help', 'students', 'have', 'environment', 'where', 'teachers', 'come', 'go', 'students', 'will', 'never', 'adjust', 'routine', 'disciplined', 'learn', 'Charter', 'Schools', 'have', 'be', 'unionize', 'as', 'well', 'public', 'schools', 'Teachers', 'staff', 'Charter', 'Schools', 'need', 'support.Most', 'charter', 'school', 'teachers', 'staff', 'do', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'remain', 'charter', 'school', 'system', 'aspire', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'Almost', 'teachers', 'who', 'left', 'school', 'was', 'went', 'public', 'school', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'fact', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'stable', 'environment', 'students', 'staff', 'alike.Remember', 'Charter', 'Schools', 'are', ""n't"", 'built', 'are', 'leased', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'last', 'fact', 'could', 'shut', 'down', 'tomorrow', 'state', 'decides', 'revoke', 'charter', 'What', 'students', 'staff', 'Where', 'do', 'go', 'Charter', 'School', 'system', 'psychological', 'issue', 'regarding', 'survival', 'faculty', 'students', 'parents.That', 'thing', 'education', 'system', 'least', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'blame', 'teachers', 'much', 'failure', 'system', 'why', 'documentary', 'fair', 'more', 'balanced', 'others', 'there']",The Cartel DVD: Home Edition
