The story line and music was very interesting.  The tale is not unfamiliar at all, though, the execution is.  This film gets to the point very quickly.

Blige and Fat Joe), the acting was superb.  Q-Tip did a great job at portraying a young black male who made a decision in defense, who becomes defenseless against the system that imprisons him.  All of his dreams, talents, and aspirations are lost to the system-indeed a sad story.

Prison Song is one of the better examples of films on the &quot;prison&quot; theme. I would say the best one was perhaps the classic Cool Hand Luke, but in post-modern times we have OZ which some of said has lost some of it's focus. Though Prison Song is not as in depth as perhaps OZ is, it's still worth at least a rental. For those who are irritated by musicals, you may want to consider renting before buying.
