967110,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B000E33VZ4,AbeStreet,"[0, 3]","I've been waiting for this release for a few years now, we'll the wait is just about over.  The first season is, in my opinion, just about the best in the series.  The jokes and plots are new and fresh.  In the later years of the show it seemed to me as though the writers were recycling a lot of material.  Some of the early episodes were filmed in black & white and the theme music was slightly different.  The interplay between the lead actors was some of the best ever on television.  Capt/Mjr Nelson is about the only person, except for Darren Stevens, who wouldn't take advantage of having a love interest who could grant his every wish.  It amazes me that so many television shows in the 60's had thirty or more episodes per season.  Here's a list of the first season episodes.1.  The Lady in the Bottle - 9/18/19652.  My Hero? - 9/25/19653.  Guess What Happened on the Way to the Moon? - 10/2/19654.  The Marriage Caper - 10/9/19655.  G.I. Jeannie - 10/16/19656.  The Yacht Murder Case - 10/23/19657.  Anybody Here Seen Jeannie? - 10/30/19658.  The Americanization of Jeannie - 11/6/19659.  The Moving Finger - 11/13/196510. Djinn and Water - 11/20/196511. Whatever Happened to Baby Custer? - 11/27/196512. Where'd You Go Go? - 12/4/196513. Russian Roulette - 12/11/196514. What House Across the Street? - 12/18/196515. Too Many Tonys - 12/25/196516.

967112,A1A4R6PU3QYVJ5,B000E33VZ4,"Amazon Customer ""Serious Reader""","[8, 9]","I'm not sure why Sony, which now owns I Dream of Jeannie, decided to colorize the first season of this series.  Whatever the reason, you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on Amazon.com that the original black-and-white version of the first season is worth a lot more.  The reason for that is simple--I Dream of Jeannie was originally broadcast in black-and-white.  And for a television fan like myself, that's the ONLY way to watch the first season.The episodes themselves are just as I remember seeing them.  Since I wasn't around in 1965, I'm pretty sure I've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here.  But to me, they're still pretty good.  The theme music, in my opinion, is every bit as good as the second theme, introduced when Jeannie went to color in 1966.The one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that Sony stripped off the old Screen Gems animation from the end of every episode.  That logo was attached to so many classic shows from the 1960s and 1970s, and it is consistenly rated, along with Viacom's old blue V of Doom, as the scariest logo in the history of television.  The new Sony outro doesn't pack the same punch.Still, if you liked Jeannie way back when, you'll love it now, especially since you can watch it anytime you like, without commercial interruption.",5,"Skip Color, Go Directly To The Black-And-White",1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,1340,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Sony', 'now', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'decided', 'colorize', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'reason', 'can', 'readily', 'tell', 'looking', 'prices', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'original', 'black-and-white', 'version', 'first', 'season', 'lot', 'more', 'reason', 'simple', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'black-and-white', 'television', 'fan', 'ONLY', 'way', 'watch', 'first', 'season.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'remember', 'seeing', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', '1965', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'cuts', 'have', 'been', 'referenced', 'here', ""'re"", 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'theme', 'music', 'opinion', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'theme', 'introduced', 'when', 'Jeannie', 'went', 'color', '1966.The', 'one', 'thing', 'truly', 'will', 'drive', 'purists', 'nuts', 'fact', 'Sony', 'stripped', 'off', 'old', 'Screen', 'Gems', 'animation', 'end', 'episode', 'logo', 'was', 'attached', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'shows', '1960s', '1970s', 'consistenly', 'rated', 'Viacom', 'old', 'blue', 'V', 'Doom', 'scariest', 'logo', 'history', 'television', 'new', 'Sony', 'outro', ""n't"", 'pack', 'same', 'punch.Still', 'liked', 'Jeannie', 'way', 'back', 'when', ""'ll"", 'love', 'now', 'especially', 'can', 'watch', 'anytime', 'like', 'commercial', 'interruption']",N/A

967114,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000E33VZ4,andy8047,"[2, 4]","OK,so these episodes premiered in black and white because they were filmed in black and white with a black and white camera. On this set,you can see the actual colors of everything as if you witnessed the tapings. Of course viewers did not know that Jeannie(Barbara Eden) was wearing red and pink when they saw the episodes in prime-time on NBC. I believe the credit for the colorization goes to television mogul Ted Turner who began the process around 1985 or '86. Turner even owned colorized versions of the Gilligan's Island Season 1 episodes,the Paramount Popeye cartoons from 1933 to '43 and the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes series from 1930 to '42. Now for the plot of this item:Captain Tony Nelson(Larry Hagman) is an astronaut who was on his way into outer space. The missile malfunctioned while on its way up and it had to be brought down. Tony and everyone else aboard landed on an island in the South Pacific. He found a beautifully crafted bottle containing a beautiful female genie named Jeannie,of course. Jeannie performed magic like the late Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stevens on Bewitched would later do. Jeannie followed Tony back to his Cocoa Beach,Florida home where he lived alone. I'm not sure if he was forever single,divorced or widowed. Tony's buddy and co-worker Captain Roger Healy(Bill Daily) was the only other person to know of Jeannie's past and capabilities. Another regular visitor to Tony's home is his psyhiatrist boss Dr. Alfred Bellows(the late Hayden Rorke). Tony often had to explain any strange behavior that occurred in his home or within himself to Dr. Bellows(he would later learn about Jeannie's past and capabilities). Jeannie,as the series progressed,began to act like an ordinary citizen. At this time,Tony was engaged to Melissa Stone,the daughter of another of Tony's superiors at NASA. The engagement was later broken and Melissa and her father would later be written out. Another one of Tony's superiors is General Peterson,who would sometimes be appalled by Tony's weirdness. I Dream Of Jeannie got the Nielsen axe in 1970. Post-IDOJ,Eden starred on the short-lived NBC series Harper Valley P.T.A.,Hagman enjoyed success playing J.R. Ewing on the CBS prime-time serial Dallas from 1979 to 1991 and Daily played Howard Borden on CBS's Newhart. IDOJ was created and produced by Sidney Sheldon. Not many viewers were fond of the original theme by Buddy Kaye and Hugo Montenegro. The later theme(for the color episodes) was more famous and remembered. In the opening montage which was animated,Jeannie's bottle comes into view,self-opens,smoke emits from the bottle with Jeannie. Then along comes Tony,Jeannie kisses Tony,they disappear and then come the credits. Jeannie retreats back to the bottle and we see a huge pair of gawking eyes on the wide-bodied bottle. For the color episodes,it's exactly the same but it begins with a descending parachute with Tony wearing it and landing on a sandy beach. Also,the bottle is already standing up. Of course,if you're one for authenticity,then you should get the set with the black and white episodes. TV Land never aired colorized versions of these episodes,since that cable station is one for authenticity. TV Land aired the episodes in the same fashion as NBC. No edited versions that were aired by many other syndicating stations.",5,More beautiful in color!,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,3331,"['OK', 'episodes', 'premiered', 'black', 'white', 'were', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'black', 'white', 'camera', 'set', 'can', 'see', 'actual', 'colors', 'everything', 'witnessed', 'tapings', 'course', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Jeannie', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'was', 'wearing', 'red', 'pink', 'when', 'saw', 'episodes', 'prime-time', 'NBC', 'believe', 'credit', 'colorization', 'television', 'mogul', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'who', 'began', 'process', '1985', 'Turner', 'even', 'owned', 'colorized', 'versions', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Season', '1', 'episodes', 'Paramount', 'Popeye', 'cartoons', '1933', ""'43"", 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'series', '1930', ""'42"", 'Now', 'plot', 'item', 'Captain', 'Tony', 'Nelson', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'astronaut', 'who', 'was', 'way', 'outer', 'space', 'missile', 'malfunctioned', 'way', 'had', 'be', 'brought', 'down', 'Tony', 'everyone', 'else', 'aboard', 'landed', 'island', 'South', 'Pacific', 'found', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'bottle', 'containing', 'beautiful', 'female', 'genie', 'named', 'Jeannie', 'course', 'Jeannie', 'performed', 'magic', 'late', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Samantha', 'Stevens', 'Bewitched', 'would', 'later', 'do', 'Jeannie', 'followed', 'Tony', 'back', 'Cocoa', 'Beach', 'Florida', 'home', 'where', 'lived', 'alone', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'forever', 'single', 'divorced', 'widowed', 'Tony', 'buddy', 'co-worker', 'Captain', 'Roger', 'Healy', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'was', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'know', 'Jeannie', 'past', 'capabilities', 'regular', 'visitor', 'Tony', 'home', 'psyhiatrist', 'boss', 'Dr.', 'Alfred', 'Bellows', 'late', 'Hayden', 'Rorke', 'Tony', 'often', 'had', 'explain', 'strange', 'behavior', 'occurred', 'home', 'Dr.', 'Bellows', 'would', 'later', 'learn', 'Jeannie', 'past', 'capabilities', 'Jeannie', 'series', 'progressed', 'began', 'act', 'ordinary', 'citizen', 'time', 'Tony', 'was', 'engaged', 'Melissa', 'Stone', 'daughter', 'Tony', 'superiors', 'NASA', 'engagement', 'was', 'later', 'broken', 'Melissa', 'father', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'written', 'out', 'one', 'Tony', 'superiors', 'General', 'Peterson', 'who', 'would', 'sometimes', 'be', 'appalled', 'Tony', 'weirdness', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'got', 'Nielsen', 'axe', '1970', 'Post-IDOJ', 'Eden', 'starred', 'short-lived', 'NBC', 'series', 'Harper', 'Valley', 'P.T.A.', 'Hagman', 'enjoyed', 'success', 'playing', 'J.R.', 'Ewing', 'CBS', 'prime-time', 'serial', 'Dallas', '1979', '1991', 'Daily', 'played', 'Howard', 'Borden', 'CBS', 'Newhart', 'IDOJ', 'was', 'created', 'produced', 'Sidney', 'Sheldon', 'Not', 'many', 'viewers', 'were', 'fond', 'original', 'theme', 'Buddy', 'Kaye', 'Hugo', 'Montenegro', 'later', 'theme', 'color', 'episodes', 'was', 'more', 'famous', 'remembered', 'opening', 'montage', 'was', 'animated', 'Jeannie', 'bottle', 'view', 'self-opens', 'smoke', 'emits', 'bottle', 'Jeannie', 'Then', 'Tony', 'Jeannie', 'Tony', 'disappear', 'then', 'come', 'credits', 'Jeannie', 'back', 'bottle', 'see', 'huge', 'pair', 'gawking', 'eyes', 'wide-bodied', 'bottle', 'color', 'exactly', 'same', 'descending', 'parachute', 'Tony', 'wearing', 'landing', 'sandy', 'beach', 'Also', 'bottle', 'already', 'standing', 'up', 'course', ""'re"", 'one', 'authenticity', 'then', 'should', 'get', 'set', 'black', 'white', 'episodes', 'TV', 'Land', 'never', 'aired', 'colorized', 'versions', 'episodes', 'cable', 'station', 'one', 'authenticity', 'TV', 'Land', 'aired', 'episodes', 'same', 'fashion', 'NBC', 'No', 'edited', 'versions', 'were', 'aired', 'many', 'other', 'syndicating', 'stations']",N/A

967120,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000E33VZ4,Byron Kolln,"[7, 8]","A consistent ratings winner during it's five-season run on NBC, I DREAM OF JEANNIE was written by Sidney Sheldon to be the network's response to the ABC sitcom ""Bewitched"", which also centered on fantasy themes and a leading lady with magical powers (and which was the ABC network's main ratings winner of the time).  Right down to the animated theme song, I DREAM OF JEANNIE aped ""Bewitched"", which irritated critics of the day, but the audiences loved it.On the shore of a deserted island somewhere in the middle of the South Pacific, astronaut Major Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman) is washed ashore after his spaceship launch is aborted.  He finds a funny-looking bottle, and after uncorking the lid, discovers that it houses a beautiful girl swathed in Arabian costume.  She is a genie, called, oddly-enough Jeannie (Barbara Eden).  Tony's life is turned upside-down by this gorgeous girl, who proceeds to make his life as magical as possible.Barbara Eden's performance in the title role was truly the key to the shows' success.  Her unique combination of girl-next-door naivete, and confiident female sexuality, gave the character of Jeannie all that was needed to capture the affections of viewers of both sexes.  Larry Hagman's impeccable abilities playing 'straight man' to Eden's comedic hurricane adds a lot to the chemistry between the two characters.I DREAM OF JEANNIE kept on top of the ratings until writers committed the cardinal sin of TV sitcoms, and decided to have Tony and Jeannie get married in Season Four.  The sexual tension between the pair had been the main underpinning for the shows' success, and following the wedding there was nowhere else to take the characters.  The show was cancelled after Season Five.The first season of I DREAM OF JEANNIE was filmed in black-and-white.  Later syndicated re-runs had those episodes colourised, and the DVD set for the first season is available in dual-editions of b&w; and colourised.  Extras include a new retrospective featurette; plus audio commentary on the first episode with Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman.COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:""The Lady in the Bottle"" - Stranded Major Tony Nelson unwittingly frees Jeannie from her 2,000-year-old confinement.""My Hero?"" - Jeannie whisks Tony back to Ancient Persia, in order to avenge her honour against Ali, the Giant-Killer.""Guess What Happened on the Way to the Moon?"" - When Tony has to undergo a mission in the desert, Jeannie equips him with every possible luxury, much to the annoyance of Roger Healey.""Jeannie and the Marriage Caper"" - Tony's beautiful fiancee Melissa decides to step up their wedding date.

I'd wish life's really like this, that I'd have a genie of my own to cater to every whim of mine, but of course it doesn't work this way.  As if I have to point this out.I mentioned a competing series that aired at the time, Bewitched.  Yes, I really like this show as well so it's likely I'll add this to my growing DVD collection.  One more comment I'll make about this series is yet another comparision, but more like how Tony and/or Jeannie at a table conversation in one S1 or S2 episode put it, comparing some items relevent to this plot are like comparing oranges and lemons.  Yes, that's how I'd compare these shows, Bewitched and IDOJ, respectively.  Enough of Bewitched for now...Anyway, I started with S2 of IDOJ by buying it at a retail outlet instead of Amazon, but I really absolutely wanted to start with S1 and not move back and forth around, so I ordered S1 online here and within days it arrived in good shape, ready to open and pop in the DVDs.  It took me nearly all week to watch in chronological order all of seasons 1 and 2, 61 episodes in all (30 and 31, respectively).  What a treat, getting to see some episodes I don't ever remember seeing before.I opted for the colorized version as I didn't want to pay some extra $8 for B&W.;  It is understandable how more valuable B&W; is given what some of the other reviewers have said here, but to me it just doesn't matter as long as I can see everything nicely, and nicely I did.Before I go on, let me say I had NO idea this show too was indeed filmed in B&W.;  Imagine my surprise when I saw a rerun in non-color.  I'd already seen only later, color episodes, some several times before I got to this point.  Why, it never even occurred to me until I realized it was done in the 1960s, the very decade when ongoing shows fortunate enough to be renewed were thus transitioned to color, and IDOJ was among them.  Another clue was I wasn't born until halfway thru the series run (1967), so no one pointed this out to me.Anyway, as I said how nice the colorized version looked, a couple things did get my attention: everyone's teeth looked somewhat gray and in one scene where, in the pilot or episode 2, Jeannie looked for a second B&W; before becoming full color after smoking out of the bottle before Tony in a confrontation.  The former amused me, made me wonder if the people responsible for colorizing them assumed the teeth's white enough, so they probably just left them alone and focused on the rest.  As for the latter, it didn't really matter to me so much as they got my attention.Just like I realized the series originally started in B&W;, its S1 theme music wasn't funky sounding like it was in the later reruns I'd seen.  That's what I really like about this show over the years, the perky-sounding opening music.  To be honest though, I like the funky version better as S1 sounded somewhat classical.  Was it common for shows back then to start with conservative theme lyrics, then move on to higher-octane sounding versions in later seasons?  That's what I noticed on The Brady Bunch, my all-time favorite show.  I don't have TBB yet; I'm in no rush as I've seen everything countless times already, that I'll probably just get the entire series at once when I'm ready.Back to IDOJ.  The colors do look beautiful to the point that Technicolor could take credit for it, but if you're not very picky like me, then save some moola and go for the colorized version.  I know S3's been out too, so I'm gonna get this one in due time.

To give a very brief history as to why I purchased the colorized version, as opposed to the black and white version, let me take you back to the recent DVD release of ""Bewitched.""  Because I was skeptical of the colorization process, I purchased both the black and white, and colorized versions; however, when I watched the colorized version of ""Bewitched,"" I was so impressed with the colorization, I decided that when ""I Dream of Jeannie"" was released, I would only order the colorized version; I was not disappointed.Technology has come a long way since the early days of colorization. Here skin tones match, costumes sparkle, and the backdrops of Cocoa Beach look particularly inviting in this brilliant new release. To lend credence to my review, I watched the first disc of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" on an HDTV 50"" screen.  If there were any flaws, I surely would have noticed them.The first episode offers a commentary by three of the show's stars; Barbara Eden, Larry Hagman, and Bill Daily. It's fun listening to them as they reminisce about the show, the actors, and the fun they had. I guess when they recorded the audio commentary, the stars were watching the black and white version because Bill Daily constantly refers to how pretty both Barbara and Larry looked in black and white.  One of the funniest moments was when Bill Daily said that he was falling in love with Larry because he was so gorgeous.I give this series five *****.  If you can afford both the black and white, and color versions, get them both; however, if you can only afford one version, I urge you to purchase the color version.  You won't be disappointed. Plus, you'll be able to introduce this show to your kids.  Kids today grow up with color television; therefore, black and white shows don't have the same appeal as color television programs and movies.John (Cinemajohn)Dallas, TX",5,Jeannie Shines in New Colorized Version,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,1950,"['just', 'watched', 'first', 'disc', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'give', 'very', 'brief', 'history', 'why', 'purchased', 'colorized', 'version', 'opposed', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'let', 'take', 'back', 'recent', 'DVD', 'release', 'Bewitched', 'was', 'skeptical', 'colorization', 'process', 'purchased', 'black', 'white', 'colorized', 'versions', 'however', 'when', 'watched', 'colorized', 'version', 'Bewitched', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'colorization', 'decided', 'when', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'was', 'released', 'would', 'only', 'order', 'colorized', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.Technology', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'early', 'days', 'colorization', 'Here', 'skin', 'tones', 'match', 'costumes', 'sparkle', 'backdrops', 'Cocoa', 'Beach', 'look', 'particularly', 'inviting', 'brilliant', 'new', 'release', 'lend', 'credence', 'review', 'watched', 'first', 'disc', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'HDTV', '50', 'screen', 'were', 'flaws', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'first', 'episode', 'commentary', 'three', 'show', 'stars', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'fun', 'listening', 'reminisce', 'show', 'actors', 'fun', 'had', 'guess', 'when', 'recorded', 'audio', 'commentary', 'stars', 'were', 'watching', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'constantly', 'how', 'pretty', 'Barbara', 'Larry', 'looked', 'black', 'white', 'One', 'funniest', 'moments', 'was', 'when', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'said', 'was', 'falling', 'love', 'Larry', 'was', 'so', 'gorgeous.I', 'give', 'series', 'five', '*****', 'can', 'afford', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'versions', 'get', 'however', 'can', 'only', 'afford', 'one', 'version', 'urge', 'purchase', 'color', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'introduce', 'show', 'kids', 'Kids', 'today', 'grow', 'up', 'color', 'television', 'therefore', 'black', 'white', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'appeal', 'color', 'television', 'programs', 'movies.John', 'Cinemajohn', 'Dallas', 'TX']",N/A

It's a silly show, based on a silly premise, with silly story lines and silly acting... but it's a classic, and it's great. But my review is more about this specific disc set than the show itself. If you're looking at this product it is probably because you're a fan of the show - you don't need to be sold about that.This disc set is well packaged, but I have a couple complaints:COLORIZED - This set is the colorized version of the first season of the show, which was filmed and broadcast in black and white. I would much prefer the original black and white. The colorization makes the colors very gawdy most of the time. In addition, the colorization of the actors' skin is not always very flattering.DISC PROBLEMS - There are some intermittent disc problems in this set. The screen will freeze up, then jump far ahead to another scene. There is no way that I've found to go back without the same problem reoccuring. Poor quality.UPDATE -- After having no better success with the disc problems noted above, I did an examination and found that all four discs in this set were severely damaged on the playing surface. There were numerous scratches and abrasions on every disc, some worse than others. I was forced to return the set for a refund. I will not re-purchase, for fear of getting another one that is just as bad.

As an adult, I was able to perceive many things that simply went over my head as a child.  This was actually quite an edgy show by mid 1960's standards.  Oh how I wished this show would be released on DVD, and lo and behold it my wish was granted!(And, I bought the B&W; version because I prize historical accuracy.  I want to see exactly what was shown on TV back then, without the lousy TV's we had back then.)You've got a blond bombshell, who is eager to please in every way a man could imagine, living out of wedlock with an astronaut, who represented the most heroic all-american roll models we had back in the 1960's.  And somehow, for years, this show provided good clean TV fun for millions of viewers.Part of why it worked I suppose is that Jeannie really wanted to marry Tony, and slowly but surely she broke down his resolve not to marry her until toward the end of the series, when they actually do get married.  The meta-narrative of the show is thatJeannie got her wish.  (Oh yeah, and she slept in her bottle until she did!)Is IDOJ really a ""knockoff"" of Bewitched?  Yes and no.  I rather think of IDOJ as an improvement.For example, the last scene in the pilot has Tony walking into his bedroom and closing the door, Jeannie turning to smoke and entering his bedroom under the door, Tony yelling ""Knock it off!!"" or something like that, and Jeannie coming back out from under the door and reappearing with a wink to the camera.  It's all left to the imagination what happened in there and it's funny!And that's where IDOJ is very different from Bewitched.  In IDOJ, the hottie with the supernatural powers gets to be sexual, whereas in Bewitched she does not.In Bewitched, Samantha is the sane one with a world of lunacy around her in which she tries to maintain order and survive the crisis of the week.  She is usually uptight and in crisis mode and after a while I just start to wonder what she ever saw in Darrin in the first place.  Also, this formula gets repetitve.  I doubt that I'll ever order the Bewitched series for that very reason: it's much the same story every week.In IDOJ, Tony is the sane one in a world of lunatics, and Jeannie is often part of the chaos.  Jeannie gets to be beautiful, sexual, smart, mischevious, and most importantly, unpredictable.  Will she be part of the problem or the solution this week?  Or, will she try to be part of the solution and instead bring on more chaos?  You really don't know whats coming.Also, I really appreciate the work that went into some of the props and stunts that often only provided a gag lasting a few seconds.  In particular when Jeannie makes herself small and has to hide in items like coffee cups, pencil holders, and things like that.  Those kind of scenes take a lot of work to set up.  There's some genuine special effects work in this series beyond just objects dissappearing and reappearing.Oh, and one more thing.  The DVDs are single sided!!  I can actually look at them and see what disc I'm holding!  I can handle them without going into ""brain surgeon"" mode in order to avoid damaging them!  They actually did the packaging correctly!  WOW!So, here you've got a properly packaged example of the best that 1960's sitcoms had to offer, and for under $30.  Stop wishing and start buying!Postscript:  My one dissappointment with this DVD set is the commentary on the pilot episode.

967146,A1HCHMYMPO97CL,B000E33VZ4,M. J. Dirou,"[4, 8]","Yes, I confess if I had to choose I'd pick Bewitched as my favourite of the two shows. I was never really sure who had copied who, since they were filmed around the same time, but I got a lot of pleasure and laughs from both these wonderful shows growing up in the 70's and have continued to enjoy the re-runs over the years. Inevitably, these two fantasy style comedies are going to be pitted up against each other and compared. Who is the cuter blonde lead? Which character correlates with which? Although Major Nelson (Larry Hagman), is a much dishier master of the house, hands down; hard to believe he was the same actor who played the evil 'J.R' in Dallas. Regardless of these comparisons, ultimately I think they are two quality shows in their own right with great slapstick comedy, performances, writing and production. Though Bewitched did have the greater depth and overall class of the two, 'Jeannie' was equally funny and with often more hilarious physical comedy, especially from Hagman.Babara Eden is such a beautiful woman. She has a touch of the exotic about her face and voice, mixed with the pretty blonde all American look, that is very suited to the role. It is very difficult and ultimately pointless to pick between her and 'Samantha'(Elizabeth Montgomery), because they each have their own style and character. Samatha though, is the more wholesome of the two. I read somewhere that there was some controversy back then about 'Jeannie' being allowed to display her (quite ample) cleavage but not her belly button. The latter would have been more authentic, though maybe not as tasteful to viewers then.Major Healy is a fun side kick and pal to Major Nelson, and poor old Dr Bellows (who I think correlates more to 'Mrs Kravitz' in Bewitched than 'Endora' as was mentioned by one reviewer), can never catch a break. His constant and seemingly imagined, witnessing of Major Nelson's strange activites, is made even more amusingly ironic by the fact that he's a Psychiatrist.What is also most amusing about the show is the way it turns around and pokes fun at the concept of the male master being in command of his supposed 'female slave'. Who is really in charge of who? Major Nelson thinks he is living every male fantasy by catching his very own sexy looking female version of 'Aladin's Genie', in a bottle; who promises to make his every wish come true. But it is she who always ends up having the last laugh! A Cute battle of the sexes in a way, and a light 60's comedy not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed.",5,Not just a  follow up to Bewitched,1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,2535,"['Yes', 'confess', 'had', 'choose', ""'d"", 'pick', 'Bewitched', 'favourite', 'two', 'shows', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'who', 'had', 'copied', 'who', 'were', 'filmed', 'same', 'time', 'got', 'lot', 'pleasure', 'wonderful', 'shows', 'growing', 'up', '70', 'have', 'continued', 'enjoy', 're-runs', 'years', 'Inevitably', 'two', 'fantasy', 'style', 'comedies', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'pitted', 'up', 'other', 'compared', 'Who', 'cuter', 'blonde', 'lead', 'Which', 'character', 'correlates', 'Major', 'Nelson', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'much', 'dishier', 'master', 'house', 'down', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'evil', 'J.R', 'Dallas', 'Regardless', 'comparisons', 'ultimately', 'think', 'are', 'two', 'quality', 'shows', 'own', 'right', 'great', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'performances', 'writing', 'production', 'Bewitched', 'did', 'have', 'greater', 'depth', 'overall', 'class', 'two', 'was', 'equally', 'funny', 'often', 'more', 'hilarious', 'physical', 'comedy', 'especially', 'Hagman.Babara', 'Eden', 'such', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'touch', 'exotic', 'face', 'voice', 'mixed', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'American', 'look', 'very', 'suited', 'role', 'very', 'difficult', 'ultimately', 'pointless', 'pick', ""'Samantha"", 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'have', 'own', 'style', 'character', 'Samatha', 'more', 'wholesome', 'two', 'read', 'somewhere', 'was', 'controversy', 'back', 'then', ""'Jeannie"", 'being', 'allowed', 'display', 'quite', 'ample', 'cleavage', 'not', 'belly', 'button', 'latter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'authentic', 'maybe', 'not', 'tasteful', 'viewers', 'then.Major', 'Healy', 'fun', 'side', 'kick', 'pal', 'Major', 'Nelson', 'poor', 'old', 'Dr', 'Bellows', 'who', 'think', 'correlates', 'more', ""'Mrs"", 'Kravitz', 'Bewitched', ""'Endora"", 'was', 'mentioned', 'one', 'reviewer', 'can', 'never', 'catch', 'break', 'constant', 'seemingly', 'imagined', 'witnessing', 'Major', 'Nelson', 'strange', 'activites', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'amusingly', 'ironic', 'fact', 'Psychiatrist.What', 'also', 'most', 'amusing', 'show', 'way', 'around', 'fun', 'concept', 'male', 'master', 'being', 'command', 'supposed', 'slave', 'Who', 'really', 'charge', 'who', 'Major', 'Nelson', 'living', 'male', 'fantasy', 'catching', 'very', 'own', 'sexy', 'looking', 'female', 'version', ""'Aladin"", 'Genie', 'bottle', 'who', 'make', 'wish', 'come', 'true', 'who', 'always', 'up', 'having', 'last', 'laugh', 'Cute', 'battle', 'sexes', 'way', 'light', '60', 'comedy', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'just', 'enjoyed']",N/A

967152,A25XGZX0YRTJKN,B000E33VZ4,Paul J. Moade,"[3, 3]","I Dream of Jeannie. I remember the show from my teen years when the standard news was all about the space program (space race), Viet Nam and hippies.This was a magical breath from the realm of make-believe where everything always turns out right in the end. And had a gorgeous blond genie to boot.The series is nostalgic for me, having grown up with Tony, Roger and Jeannie; but it is the same breath of relief from a weary world for today's generation. The props may be dated, the effects are not the latest eye-candy CGI we have in today's productions, but the magic of the show was the interaction between the main characters -- much as it was for the original Star Trek.Barbara Eden was a PERFECT choice in casting and made the show what it was. She could play the dichotomy of being both a bubbley, ditzy, beautiful blond and a clever, intelligent, resourceful woman at the same time. America's male population fell in love with her -- and who wouldn't? Jeannie was the perfect female companion. Loving, caring, intelligent, witty, innocent (yet worldly), loyal, and yes --sensuous too.Larry (Maj Nelson) played the typical workaholic male who, too often, missed seeing what [treasure] was right in front of him. He was dedicated, straight, honest and caring (in a negligent kind of way) who often took Jeannie for granted. However, when the chips are down and it looks like Jeannie is going to have to leave (or is emotionally hurt), he vocalizes his feelings for her. The lines come across as sincere and not as part of a script -- great acting! That's the on screen magic and made him perfect to play opposite of Barbara.Bill (Maj Healy) was the craftly, schemeing friend who, in spite of everything, really was a friend but who often let his materialistic desires get the better of him. He also had the quality of not seeing a situation that was developing and often put both feet (up to the ankles) in his mouth. It produced a laughable, lovable character which contrasted with his best friend, Maj Nelson.The final main character, Dr. (Colonel) Bellows got to be the show's goat. He's honest and sincere, but knows that in back of all the strange things that go on in Cocoa Beach lurks Tony Nelson. And he's putting together a file to get the truth out of Tony. However, each time he thinks he's got his target cornered, Maj Nelson slips away and comes out smelling like roses. His most frequently repeated line is, ""He's done it to me again!""I bought the first season with some tripidation since my experience with ""colorized"" versions has always been disappointing. No so here. The color version (the original first season was black and white) looks as if it were orginally filmed that way. A very pleasant surprise indeed.The DVD transfer is clean and the sound is sharp. The third disc on my set was unplayable, but Amazon is correcting that, so no complaints. The first season comes on four single sided discs in two ""slimline"" cases; neatly package in a bookcase box.My only disappointment (and that of many others who've mentioned the extra) is the commentary on the pilot episode. I was expecting some sort of insight as to the making of the series and the driving ideals behind it. What I got was Larry, Barbara and Bill sitting around making inane comments about how good everything looked. It was bad enough that I stopped the DVD and restarted it with the commentary turned off. On a brighter note, the short with Sidney Sheldon was interesting and informative -- well worth watching.For those who have not seen any of this series, why not try it? There is humor and pathos (some episodes even bring a tear to the eye). The actors perform admirably and the chemisty (as mentioned) is right. For those who have already seen the series, I need say nothing more.Highly Recommended for any age.~P~",5,A Sitcom Flashback to the glory years of the Sixties,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,3816,"['Dream', 'Jeannie', 'remember', 'show', 'teen', 'years', 'when', 'standard', 'news', 'was', 'space', 'program', 'space', 'race', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'hippies.This', 'was', 'magical', 'breath', 'realm', 'make-believe', 'where', 'everything', 'always', 'out', 'right', 'end', 'had', 'gorgeous', 'blond', 'genie', 'boot.The', 'series', 'nostalgic', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'Tony', 'Roger', 'Jeannie', 'same', 'breath', 'relief', 'weary', 'world', 'today', 'generation', 'props', 'may', 'be', 'dated', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'latest', 'eye-candy', 'CGI', 'have', 'today', 'productions', 'magic', 'show', 'was', 'interaction', 'main', 'characters', 'much', 'was', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek.Barbara', 'Eden', 'was', 'PERFECT', 'choice', 'casting', 'made', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'could', 'play', 'dichotomy', 'being', 'bubbley', 'ditzy', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'resourceful', 'woman', 'same', 'time', 'America', 'male', 'population', 'fell', 'love', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'Jeannie', 'was', 'perfect', 'female', 'companion', 'Loving', 'caring', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'innocent', 'yet', 'worldly', 'loyal', 'yes', 'sensuous', 'too.Larry', 'Maj', 'Nelson', 'played', 'typical', 'workaholic', 'male', 'who', 'too', 'often', 'missed', 'seeing', 'what', '[', 'treasure', ']', 'was', 'right', 'front', 'was', 'dedicated', 'straight', 'honest', 'caring', 'negligent', 'kind', 'way', 'who', 'often', 'took', 'Jeannie', 'granted', 'However', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'Jeannie', 'going', 'have', 'leave', 'emotionally', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'lines', 'come', 'sincere', 'not', 'part', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'screen', 'magic', 'made', 'perfect', 'play', 'opposite', 'Barbara.Bill', 'Maj', 'Healy', 'was', 'craftly', 'schemeing', 'friend', 'who', 'spite', 'everything', 'really', 'was', 'friend', 'who', 'often', 'let', 'materialistic', 'desires', 'get', 'better', 'also', 'had', 'quality', 'not', 'seeing', 'situation', 'was', 'developing', 'often', 'put', 'feet', 'ankles', 'mouth', 'produced', 'laughable', 'lovable', 'character', 'contrasted', 'best', 'friend', 'Maj', 'Nelson.The', 'final', 'main', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Colonel', 'Bellows', 'got', 'be', 'show', 'goat', 'honest', 'sincere', 'back', 'strange', 'things', 'go', 'Cocoa', 'Beach', 'Tony', 'Nelson', 'putting', 'together', 'file', 'get', 'truth', 'Tony', 'However', 'time', 'got', 'target', 'cornered', 'Maj', 'Nelson', 'away', 'out', 'smelling', 'roses', 'most', 'frequently', 'repeated', 'line', 'done', 'again', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'tripidation', 'experience', 'colorized', 'versions', 'always', 'been', 'disappointing', 'so', 'here', 'color', 'version', 'original', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'were', 'orginally', 'filmed', 'way', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'indeed.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'clean', 'sound', 'sharp', 'third', 'disc', 'set', 'was', 'unplayable', 'Amazon', 'correcting', 'complaints', 'first', 'season', 'four', 'single', 'sided', 'discs', 'two', 'slimline', 'cases', 'neatly', 'package', 'bookcase', 'box.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'many', 'others', 'who', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'extra', 'commentary', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'expecting', 'sort', 'insight', 'making', 'series', 'driving', 'ideals', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'Larry', 'Barbara', 'Bill', 'sitting', 'making', 'inane', 'comments', 'how', 'good', 'everything', 'looked', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'stopped', 'DVD', 'restarted', 'commentary', 'turned', 'off', 'brighter', 'note', 'short', 'Sidney', 'Sheldon', 'was', 'interesting', 'informative', 'well', 'watching.For', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'why', 'not', 'try', 'humor', 'pathos', 'episodes', 'even', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'actors', 'perform', 'admirably', 'chemisty', 'mentioned', 'right', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'series', 'need', 'say', 'nothing', 'more.Highly', 'Recommended', 'age.~P~']",N/A

967157,A1DMYUSXX77JEW,B000E33VZ4,Robert Bauer,"[6, 7]","This is one of my all time favorite tv shows. Although same in concept and scope than Bewitched, this shows superior cast and performances tower over Bewitched. I believe this show was much more funnier than Bewitched. Barbara Eden stars as Jeannie and Larry Hagman stars as Cap.(later Maj.) Anthony Nelson. And Bill Daily stars as Roger Healy, Maj. Nelsons best friend.  This dvd set covers the entire 1st season (30 episodes) of the series. Since this series 1st season was shot in black and white, this is the preference for me over the alternative colorized dvd set. As far as the video and audio go, the video looks fantastic. Episodes are clean and sharp with no compression. No dirt or scratches noticeable. Audio is in clean 2.0 mono sound. All episodes are complete and uncut. The pilot episode includes a audio commentary with Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily. It's nice and pleasant but not very informative. This is the main problem I have about this set. NO INFORMATION!! To me this keeps this set from getting 5 stars. The 4 dvds come in 2 seperate cases covering all 30 episodes. On the back of the cases you get episode #, title of each episode, and small description of each one. I think there should be more info than this, so I had hoped when I played the dvds, got to the main menu, and selected an episode, I would get a small amount of trivia, some more details such as  production date, 1st broadcast date, and cast listing with special guest stars. No such luck. I had hoped for much more info about each episode. You get a 14 minute featurette with new interviews with Sidney Sheldon, Larry Hagmen, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily, which is a nice (but short) special feature. It's nice to see them together and still very good friends. They were the backbone of this great show (along with the late Hayden Roarke). Hayden Roarke was wonderful as Dr. Alfred Bellows. I would have loved for him to have been there too. In closing this is still a great set to have, and I intend to have all 5 seasons of this great show.

967158,A1Z3RSRD9E4IRA,B000E33VZ4,Robert Jaz,"[7, 10]","This box set is a fantastic long awaited gem. I Dream of Jeannie is such a fun, swinging good time that nicely captures the mid '60s mod era of America during it's space age wonder period. Sure it's silly and escapist (and as a sexy dreamboat, Barbara Eden was up there with sirens like The Avengers, Dianna Rigg) goofiness, but that's what makes it a great time capsule. I am thankful to the folks that choose to give us the original black and white as broadcast - it's nice to have the option for colorization if you want that, but I am never interested in changing tv history. I can wait for the seasons that become color instead. There are few sidekick characters as funny as Roger and let's not forget Dr. Bellows with the much younger and very good looking wife!! ha ha - as this show progressed there are some amazing episodes that feature then current swinging cats like Sammy Davis Jr. too!!As far as the reviewer that gave this 5 star set 1 star because they messed with the original pilot - well, I am sick of nitpickers - you may have a point that it would be better to have it in the proper form but really - this remastered version may not have the Farsi subtitles but I'll wager it's alot better than that grainy video bootleg from the '70s you've been watching over and over in your mother's basement.

967159,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000E33VZ4,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[11, 14]","First off, let's admit this 30 episode 1965-1966 seasons just has to be viewed in color to take in all of essence. Regardless of what it was actually filmed and or originally viewed in, it begs for the garish psychedelia only made possible through Technicolor editing. Black and white just can't deliver the adventures of a `young' genie and her befuddled master. How else are would we get to see the fine details of Jeannie's 'bottle' (actually a painted liquor bottle!)?This series often gets compared to Bewitched-unfairly loosing out. Critics forget that it more daringly had pushed several buttons--- and all at once too. Jeannie (Barbara Eden) technically was a `California blonde' but was undoubtedly supposed to be Middle Eastern and she and Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman) also lived together without ever actually getting married until the series end!Our story begins with Nelson stranded on a desert island  following a return from space (""The Lady in the Bottle""). He's puzzled what to do next until Jeannie pops out and promises total devotion to him. Nelson is an astronaut at the then-named Cape Kennedy in Florida.Jeannie is smitten with him (""My Hero?"") but at least in this season Tony is engaged to marry somebody else (""The Great Marriage Caper""). However, a 2,000-year old genie has plenty of ideas to try---including joining the military (""G.I. Jeannie""). She also asks her own mother (Florence Sundstrom) for advice (""My Hero?"") to snag the hapless male protagonist.In keeping with the era of series production, all NASA personnel are culled from the military. This also reflected mass public Cold War era support for the military-industrial complex itself. The military was all that allegedly protected America against the `red menace' of communism.However, the military itself feels threatened by ever-shifting sexual mores. Constantly investigating the `odd' events which begin happening around both Nelson and friend Major Healey (Bill Daley) base psychiatrist Dr. Alfred Bellows (Hayden Rourke). Bellows presence alludes to that era's screening out of suspected homosexuals for `national security' purposes-he makes first appearance in ""Anybody Here Seen Jeannie?"". Audiences are supposed to see Dr. Bellows as a threat to Tony, Jeannie, and Roger---but also recognize that he is not 'evil'. He does keep the guys on their toes though!Jeannie's heritage is given some time in this series even if it isn't authentic regional history (""Djinn and Water"", ""Get Me to Mecca on Time""); these storylines also show Tony and Roger essentially granting HER wishes to do things. Oddly, Jeannie's relatives have Arabic sounding names and appearances while she does not. Still, perhaps considering how little American sitcoms regularly have about anything related to the Middle East, the series unintentionally was ground-breaking.'Jeannie' also attempted to address the women's liberation movement. After reading a magazine article in ""The Americanization of Jeannie"" Jeannie decides that she is through with the unpaid housework which was previously performed for Tony. However more of a lampoon than an actual support for the critique, this episode did acknowledge feminist criticisms of American culture.  In ""Russian Roulette"" the series acknowledged the Russians already had women flying into space---something which America would not be able to claim until the 1980's .In ""Richest Astronaut in the World"" Roger Healey finally learns Jeannie's real identity. For the rest of the series, he is an accomplice in on the secret. This helps reduce some of the stress on Tony, whenever Jeannie does something. Healey covets Jeannie for his own benefit, but she remains with Nelson throughout the whole series.Hagman always has been underrated as an actor. Very few people can make looking stressed out being so funny!  It's still amazing to realize that he later went on to play both ""JR"" in 'Dallas' and ""Fred Picker"" in 'Primary Colors'.The network's infamous panic over Eden's belly button is a riot now.

The initial  episodes have a narrative style introduction, similar to the way BEWITCHED  started in season one.All of the classic episodes from this  season are there, and a total  joy to watch. Mostly the wire work is not as bad as MY FAVORITE  MARTIAN, but not as Good as BEWITCHED... and some boom  shadows are clearly evident, anyway, considering that each episode was 3 days from read through to filming, they did quite a job.Supposedly Larry Hagman was discovered doing a Soap  Opera, but discovering Barbara Eden was not  quite the act of Serendipity that the creator of the Show states; Barbara  Eden was in the film THE BRASS  BOTTLE, done about 1-2 years before, and it was glaringly obvious that someone that beautiful could be an asset if the Genie was female.The Extras on this set are small but superb. The Commentary on the pilot is mostly Barbara  Eden. Larry could have phoned his  words in, but he makes up for it on the 4th disc in the featurette OUT OF THE BOTTLE. On the pilot commentary Barbara  asserts that the show was filmed in color on or after the 13th  episode, however, this is contradicted in the featurette. It's clear that the production design is for Black and White, but Sheldon was quite willing to pay the extra per show to do it in colour.One Bonus ""trivia"" is at the end of the show ... Watch for one  show that still retains the SCREEN GEMS music and logo signoff... kind of intriguing seeing that instead of the Sony signoff on the rest of the series :-)It's a real joy to see a show that still works  well after 40 years.

Some say you can just buy the color version and turn the color on the set down to watch the black and white, but this does NOT really work, as the grey scales are thrown off. I mean, if you take a finely detailed pencil drawing with many shades of gray, have your kid use his crayons on it, and then take a black and white photo of the result, it would not look like the original!(The second season on will of course be in color only as originally seen.)I do not see any edits on this set; all shows appear to be the complete network versions, about 4 minutes longer than the edited stuff TV Land runs! The pilot isn't really edited, despite what one reviewer claims. Maybe he's seen the slightly alternate/extended version that has surfaced in some places? There are two versions of the pilot.

In fact, if you're a feminist, I recommend you don't come within a range of fifty feet of this TV show.""I Dream of Jeannie"" is definitely a male's fantasy in practically every way possible.No, guys! I hate to break the news to you! I'm afraid there aren't very many, if ANY actual women in the world who are anywhere near as submissive and subservient as Jeannie, let alone look like Jeannie at the same time! A woman like Jeannie did not exist even in the old days. Not even Barbara Eden herself would have come close. If you are looking for a Jeannie clone in real life, you'll be quite disappointed.Perhaps that was the entire reason for the show. That type of woman simply does not exist in the real world and the producers thought it would be profitable to put her on a television series.....and what a profit they made! I'm sure only the oil companies today are capable of making bigger profits.as to the artistic quality of the show...Is this TV show clever comedy? Possibly, however, comedies that came earlier had one very big advantage. There was no canned laughter. If a show were actually funny, there would be no need at all for the canned laughter.""I Dream of Jeannie"" probably did not need the canned laughter because there were some genuine funny parts, but sadly enough, the canned laughter was inserted. Perhaps it was just a sign of that time.... Thankfully, most comedies today have no canned laughter.Perhaps it was what ""I Dream of Jeannie"" did NOT have that made the show a classic.There are no political messages, no moral lessons, no mention of war and peace, . . . and that is another wonderful fantasy. A world with no political issues is a world that is paradise. .... and again, it is a world that could never exist..except on TV.Archie Bunker then came to town in the 1970s.... thus endeth paradise!Yes, ""I Dream of Jeannie"" is silly.

He uncorks it, and a big trail of pink smoke flows out. A gorgeous female Genie, materializes from the smoke cloud. The Astronaut, Major Tony Nelson, allows the Genie to come back with him to his home in Coca Beach, FL. This sets the stage for the basic premise of this show, which revolves around the misadventures of Major Nelson, and how his life is turned upside-down by the Genie.I Dream Of Jeannie premiered on TV, roughly a year after that other show about a magical female, called Bewitched. I thought that I Dream Of Jeannie, was more in tune with the changing social mores of the 60s. After all, Tony Nelson was a swinging bachelor, who had a hot-looking babe of a Genie, at his disposal. On the other hand, Bewitched was more like the staid sitcom Leave It To Beaver, except that the wife and mother in Bewitched had supernatural powers.Larry Hagman as Major Tony Nelson, was a perfect straight-arrow foil for his co-star, Barbara Eden as Jeannie. They had a crackling on-screen chemistry between them. Bill Daly as Tony's colleague and friend, Captain Roger Healy, added a nice comic touch to the show. So did Hayden Rourke as Tony's superior, Dr. Bellows. Dr. Bellows was forever trying to get a handle on why such strange situations, always seemed to surround Major Nelson.This was a good show in it's day.

I had never watched it straight through though, and, of course, did not realize what a ground-breaking concept it was for a show.I ordered the colorized version of the DVDs because I don't like black and white.  There are only a couple of places on the DVDs that you can tell you are watching a black and white show that has been colorized.  Given that the running time of the DVDs is 780 minutes, I think that is excellent.  The colors are obviously taken from the other seasons of the show (Jeannie's bottle, outfit, Major Nelson's house, etc.) so they look real.The ""current"" interviews with Sidney Sheldon, Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily are priceless.  A true treat for any fan.  When you're watching the show, you forget that they made it 40 years ago, so it is truly startling to see how much they've aged.  Sidney Sheldon provides some great behind-the-scenes insight about the show (why the first season was in black and white, what Major Nelson could and couldn't do on screen, etc.).This is treat for any Jeannie fan who likes to watch their favorite shows on DVD (in order, no commercial breaks, etc.).

I guess because season one originally aired in black and white and they didn't do a good job on tranfer to color. I really noticed this because I went backwards and I watched season 2 first and then ordered season 1 and you can tell the difference. Even Jeannie's hair color looks a little orange, and some of the color is not exact as it should be. It didn't look near as bad once you got to the 3rd show on season one, and from there on in it was pretty decent and about as good picture quality as season 2. I was just shocked about the first two shows in the season, if they could make the rest of the shows clearer then why not the first two!? When I first watched the set I wished I had ordered it in black and white, but after those first two episodes the picture quality got better and I was satisfied. The box set doesn't come with any extras, but the price is decent so it is definitely worth buying it. I bought season 2 at walmart for 19.99 and season 1 on Amazon, because I couldn't find it in the store and it was about 29.99. Anyway I cannot wait until season 3 comes out in January, I am really looking foward to adding this one to my collection as well. Amazon is taking pre orders right now for season 3, so I might go ahead and order it, or I might wait and see if it is cheaper at Walmart but I haven't decided yet. I love all of the dvd sets! They are great, I have Bewitched and all of the I love Lucy seasons as well and they give good entertainment to watch and definitely worth the price. The I love Lucy set is full of extras, as you can see that the price is higher as well. It is possible that after all these sets come out in a few years from now when people aren't buying them as much, that the prices will drop way down and become more affordable. Because the dvds aren't that expensive to produce, although they have to make a good profit of course. All in all I definitely recommend season 1 on dvd! I love the episode where Jeannie goes out on a date with Major Healey to make Tony jeolous, that is before Major Healey finds out that Jeannie is a genie, and of course the first episode where Tony finds Jeannie on the island is a great one too.",5,Great Season!,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,2271,"['color', 'not', 'good', 'shows', 'box', 'set', 'season', '2', 'lot', 'better', 'guess', 'season', 'one', 'originally', 'aired', 'black', 'white', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'tranfer', 'color', 'really', 'noticed', 'went', 'backwards', 'watched', 'season', '2', 'first', 'then', 'ordered', 'season', '1', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'Even', 'Jeannie', 'hair', 'color', 'little', 'orange', 'color', 'not', 'exact', 'should', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'got', '3rd', 'show', 'season', 'one', 'there', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'as', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'season', '2', 'was', 'just', 'shocked', 'first', 'two', 'shows', 'season', 'could', 'make', 'rest', 'shows', 'clearer', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'first', 'two', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'set', 'wished', 'had', 'ordered', 'black', 'white', 'first', 'two', 'picture', 'quality', 'got', 'better', 'was', 'satisfied', 'box', 'set', ""n't"", 'come', 'extras', 'price', 'decent', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'bought', 'season', '2', 'walmart', '19.99', 'season', '1', 'Amazon', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'store', 'was', 'about', '29.99', 'Anyway', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'season', '3', 'out', 'January', 'am', 'really', 'looking', 'foward', 'adding', 'one', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'Amazon', 'taking', 'pre', 'orders', 'right', 'now', 'season', '3', 'so', 'might', 'go', 'ahead', 'order', 'might', 'wait', 'see', 'cheaper', 'Walmart', 'have', ""n't"", 'decided', 'yet', 'love', 'dvd', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'have', 'Bewitched', 'love', 'Lucy', 'seasons', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'good', 'entertainment', 'watch', 'definitely', 'price', 'love', 'Lucy', 'set', 'full', 'extras', 'can', 'see', 'price', 'higher', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'sets', 'come', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'when', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'buying', 'much', 'prices', 'will', 'drop', 'way', 'become', 'more', 'affordable', 'dvds', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'expensive', 'produce', 'have', 'make', 'good', 'profit', 'course', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'season', '1', 'dvd', 'love', 'episode', 'where', 'Jeannie', 'out', 'date', 'Major', 'Healey', 'make', 'Tony', 'jeolous', 'Major', 'Healey', 'out', 'Jeannie', 'genie', 'course', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'Tony', 'Jeannie', 'island', 'great', 'one', 'too']",N/A

Its such a pleasure to be able to choose any episode you want, and to see the picture so clearly. The pilot episode in color is a treat, but I prefer it in its original black and white. The colorized episodes LOOK colorized to me.The three stars do a commentary during the pilot episode. Die hard fans won't learn anything new, most likely, but its fun to listen to the three of them goofing around. Its also a big treat to see the special interview with the three of them on the 4th disk.The first season itself offers some of the best episodes of the whole series. I am so glad to finally be able to collect these.I do think I will buy another copy of this season, but in Black and White. I'd like the option of either or.Oh and just for fun, there's lots of little goofs and mistakes to be found in some of the episodes. Look for Jeannie's changing braid in the episode titled ""Jeannie and the kidnapp caper"". Its not obvious if you're not tuned into the details of the costumes, but just look. Throughout the episode, while in her same Jeannie costume, her hair changes between the first season looser style (under the pillbox hat), to the braid around the head (under the hat), as seen in later seasons.

Ultimately they contacted writer Sidney Sheldon to create the premise similar in nature to ""Bewitched"". The result was ""I Dream of Jeannie"" about an astraunaut who discovers a bottle with a Jeannie inside. Jeannie would fall madly in love with her ""master"" and was known for her magical powers by blinking her eyes. Jeannie was played by the beautiful Barbara Eden and Tony (the master) was played superbly by a pre-""Dallas"" Larry Hagman.The first season was originally broadcast and filmed in black and white on NBC and the series was only one of two shows on the peacock network not shot in color. The producers wanted to film the show in color (due to the better sales in the syndication market), but NBC told them, ""don't waste your money...the show will probably only last a year.The series became a huge hit in its first year on TV coming in at #27, a remarkable standing given the show aired on Saturday nights, the death knell for new shows. ""I Dream of Jeannie"" lasted five full years.The first season box set of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" comes in either black and white or colorized editions.

Now I know purists my hate it but to me as long as the transfer looks good I really don't care if it is in black & white or in color.  Jeannie has always been compared to Bewitched.  Jeannie started one year after Bewitched and both featured good looking young blondes in the starring role and bother with neurotic, easily excitable husbands/boyfriends/masters.  Both would use the gimmick of featuring their stars Elizabeth Montgomery and Barbara Eden in dual roles throughout the series' run as well.  While I would not hesitate to call Bewitched the superior show, due largely to a better cast overall, Jeannie was no slouch and was more of a screwball comedy than Bewitched.  I have really come to appreciate the show much more in recent years through reruns on TV Land.  Larry Hagman, best known for his role as J.R. Ewing in Dallas, actually handles comedy quite well.  Barbara Eden was beautiful and even sexier than Montgomery in her harem outfits.The set begins with the first episode which I had actually never seen before until just a few years go.  Captain Tony Nelson (Hagman) finds himself stranded on an island after a rocket launch malfunction.  There he finds the antique bottle and opens it to reveal the beautiful, and centuries old Jeannie who immediately makes Nelson her ""master"".  If there is one weakness in season one it is that there's not much diversity in plots.  Basically the central plot is that Captain Nelson is always busy with his work as an astronaut and Jeannie is ignored or jealous and plots to get attention and ends up causing general chaos.About midway through the season Tony's pal and fellow Astronaut Major Healy (Bill Daly) who still doesn't know about Jeannie finally meets her and falls in love and even wants to marry her.  Jeannie, who wants to marry Tony, plots to make him jealous by accepting Major Healy's proposal and even blinks a house into a vacant lot across the street to be their dream house.  The house proceeds to appear and disappear causing grief to the Astronaut's boss Dr. Bellows.  In the hilarious ""Jeannie and the Kidnap Caper"" Tony makes Jeannie promise to stop using magic.  Soon after, Tony is kidnapped by foreign spies and Jeannie cannot lift a finger to help him.  In ""How Lucky can you Get?"" Nelson is promoted to Major and he and Major Healey go to Reno to celebrate and gamble but Healey gets greedy and enlists Jeannie's aid to help him win.While the plots may not have varied much in the first season they were still very funny, and often hilarious.

Although Jeannie would never match the popularity of Bewitched, it found some successful, and is rightfully regarded as a classic among 60's sitcoms.The first season of I Dream of Jeannie (1965-66) features Larry Hagman (Dallas TV series) as Air Force Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut in training at Cocoa Beach, Florida.  While on a test flight, Nelson drifts off course and winds up on an island where finds a bottle, and releases a genie named Jeannie (Barbara Eden), who becomes his devoted servant.Even when the writing lacks focus, the fabulous chemistry between Eden and Hagman, makes the series fun and watchable.  Hagman, who would later assume the iconic role of J.R.Ewing in Dallas, demonstrates his remarkable comedic abilities, providing a taste of the physical pratfalls that would occur later in the series.  Barbara Eden apparently wasn't Sheldon's first choice for the role, but she is simply marvelous.  Matters were complicated at the start, because Eden was pregnant, and gave birth to her only child, during the opening months of the 1965 TV season.While most other series had already transitioned to shooting in color, Season One of Jeannie is notable for being shot in black and white.  This was supposedly done to save costs, and so that some of the special effects like Jeannie's smoke would look better.  Although Hugo Montenegro's classic theme is most associated with the series, the 30 episodes in the first season feature a theme by Don Weiss, and until Episode 8, a different opening credit sequence.Tony's friend and fellow astronaut Roger Healy (Bill Dailey), has no idea that Jeannie is genie, until Episode 17.  While the series gets off to a decent start, it doesn't begin to hit its stride until Roger is in the know, assumes a bigger role.  Very quickly, things begin to settle into the familiar mold the series would follow for a majority of its run.  These developments coincide with Sidney Sheldon assuming the responsibilities at Episode 20, and taking firm control of the series.Although present from the start, Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rorke) really becomes an integral character after Sheldon turns him into an ultra-suspicious bloodhound, determined discover Tony's ""secret"".  The pattern of Bellows constantly reporting his suspicions to General Peterson (Barton MacLane), and then being made the fool, soon becomes all too familiar, along with the phase ""He's done it to me again"", as he is repeatedly made to look the fool.  With the pieces in place, the series' classic dynamic quickly begins to take shape, with Tony and Roger teaming up to handle the situations that arise from having a beautiful but jealous genie in the household, and Roger occasionally falling prey to his greed.Notable episodes include ""Is That An Extra Jeannie In The House"" which features a magician (Bernard Fox) and his aide (Emmaline Henry) who are mistaken by Roger as his own genie.  Interestingly, in Season Two Emmaline Henry (1928-1979) would be cast as Dr. Bellows wife Amanda.  ""Watch The Birdie"" is a special effects heavy episode, where with Jeannie's help, Tony displays remarkable skills at the game of golf.  ""This Is Murder"" features Gila Golan as a princess, whose ancestors are blood enemies with Jeannie's family.  While ""Jeannie and the Kidnap Caper"" features Tony being abducted by Chinese agents, who want him to reveal vital secrets.The set includes a brief but wonderfully warm feature with interviews with Barbara Eden, Larry Hagman, Bill Daily, and Sidney Sheldon recorded around 2005.  Some 40 years later, it's great to see the affection and respect the cast all still have for each other, and the program.  Married at the time to actor Michael Ansara, Barbara Eden speaks of being a mother at the same time the show was in production, as the happiest time in her life.  Despite his age, Sidney Sheldon (1917-2007) is quite lucid, and displays a marvelous childlike enthusiasm.  In 1965, Sheldon was splitting time between two coasts, as he was also working on The Patty Duke Show, which was being filmed in New York, at the same time Jeannie was being shot in California, which makes his achievements all the more impressive.The first season of I Dream Of Jeannie is good, but not great.  There are some elements with real comic potential in place, but until Sidney Sheldon takes on the writing responsibilities, the program lacks direction, and flounders a bit.  After Sheldon takes over, things quickly gel and fall into a pattern, setting the stage for more outrageous laughs in the seasons to come.",3,"after a slow start, Sidney Sheldon gets Jeannie firmly on

I'm pleased to see that the release features the choice of black and white, just as the Bewitched series. Both of these shows were originally filmed in black and white during their first couple of seasons, and they were filmed during the same years.Similar as this show may be to Bewitched, with one of the leading women as a witch and the other a jeannie, both of these shows are considered ""feel good shows"" as they permit you to do nothing but laugh. Escaping all reality, a bit of a fantasy (but a fantasy worth living), these shows will live on as innocent, clean, and good-humor shows that in no way allow themselves to become offensive to any crowd.While I speak of I Dream of Jeannie, I must referrence the time period at which this show and Bewitched were filmed. One of the reasons why these shows was so successful is due to the conditions at which this nation was facing during the time: Vietnam War. Shows during the wars seem to hold value and respect due to the extra effort put into the making of these shows to entertain an anxious and greiving nation. Again, this is a ""feel good"" show. Perhaps this is the main reason why. Unforgettable the success of I Love Lucy, it too lives on as a remarkable investment of laughs and entertainment as it was produced during another heartbreaking war; one that many have neglected to remember as three years of struggle and sacrafice lead to an unfavorable surrender: the Korean War.",5,Another Legend to Add to the Collection,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,1485,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'finally', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'see', 'release', 'choice', 'black', 'white', 'just', 'Bewitched', 'series', 'shows', 'were', 'originally', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'were', 'filmed', 'same', 'years.Similar', 'show', 'may', 'be', 'Bewitched', 'one', 'leading', 'women', 'witch', 'other', 'jeannie', 'shows', 'are', 'considered', 'feel', 'good', 'shows', 'permit', 'do', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'Escaping', 'reality', 'bit', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'worth', 'living', 'shows', 'will', 'live', 'innocent', 'clean', 'good-humor', 'shows', 'way', 'allow', 'become', 'offensive', 'crowd.While', 'speak', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'must', 'referrence', 'time', 'period', 'show', 'Bewitched', 'were', 'filmed', 'One', 'reasons', 'why', 'shows', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'due', 'conditions', 'nation', 'was', 'facing', 'time', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Shows', 'wars', 'seem', 'hold', 'value', 'respect', 'due', 'extra', 'effort', 'put', 'making', 'shows', 'entertain', 'anxious', 'greiving', 'nation', 'Again', 'feel', 'good', 'show', 'Perhaps', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'Unforgettable', 'success', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'too', 'remarkable', 'investment', 'laughs', 'entertainment', 'was', 'produced', 'heartbreaking', 'war', 'one', 'many', 'have', 'neglected', 'remember', 'three', 'years', 'struggle', 'sacrafice', 'lead', 'unfavorable', 'surrender', 'Korean', 'War']",N/A
