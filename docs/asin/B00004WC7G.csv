554506,AYV0BT5KNQFXX,B00004WC7G,Debbie Wilson,"[0, 0]","Molokai is the inspirational true story of a great man with a heart for God and man. Father Damienn, at 33, volunteers to go to Molokai to serve as the priest for the colony of lepers. At first the church plans to bring a priest in for 3 months and replace him with another priest, but Father Damien's heart for the people refuses to let him leave. His bishop warns him not to touch anyone, but his heart breaks for the people, and he, like Christ, reaches out to them literally. Not only are they outcasts exiled from humanity on the island of Molokai, but they have little food, rags for clothing, little shelter, no beds, and mostly no medicine. The government has sent them--men, women, and children-- there to die.Not only does Damien contend with the leprosy, but with politicians who want to look good while covering up how bad the situation is, by some church authorities who are more concerned about their status than about service, by forced prostitution, theft by thugs, churchmen, and greedy storekeepers, lack of food, clothing and shelter, loneliness, and at times anger and a shaky faith. While both church and government assert that the lepers are receiving help from the other, often Damien receives neither.David Wenham plays Father Damien convincingly. Peter O'Toole, always exceptional, is a dying Anglican whom Father Damien befriends. The acting is well done, but the movie covers so much time that I don't feel we really get a picture of Damien and his personal struggles as sharply as we could. That's why I gave the movie 4 stars. For instance, when Damien is told that if he goes back to the island, he will spend the rest of his life there, Damien flinches but does not hesitate to do his duty. That changes as the movie nears the end, and Damien discovers that he does have leprosy. We see more of his struggles. He takes on his supervisor and defies the hierarchy by marrying a repentant thug and his live-in divorced girlfriend.It's a good movie that I shared with my teenage daughter, but it didn't grab my heart like Amistad did. It's well worth seeing, might even be good to show a youth group the intense love of God and man that one man can possess. Because of the prostitution, the scarring, and one attempted seduction scene, parents may wish to show this to the older members of the family after the little ones are in bed. We, even non-Catholics like myself, need heroes like Father Damien whose love of God and his compassion for suffering people inspire us to love God and serve others more.",4,Inspirational Story of a Great Man,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,2532,"['Molokai', 'inspirational', 'true', 'story', 'great', 'man', 'heart', 'God', 'man', 'Father', 'Damienn', '33', 'volunteers', 'go', 'Molokai', 'serve', 'priest', 'colony', 'lepers', 'first', 'church', 'plans', 'bring', 'priest', '3', 'months', 'replace', 'priest', 'Father', 'Damien', 'heart', 'people', 'let', 'leave', 'bishop', 'not', 'touch', 'anyone', 'heart', 'breaks', 'people', 'Christ', 'out', 'literally', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'outcasts', 'exiled', 'humanity', 'island', 'Molokai', 'have', 'little', 'food', 'rags', 'clothing', 'little', 'shelter', 'beds', 'mostly', 'medicine', 'government', 'sent', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'there', 'die.Not', 'only', 'Damien', 'contend', 'leprosy', 'politicians', 'who', 'want', 'look', 'good', 'covering', 'up', 'how', 'bad', 'situation', 'church', 'authorities', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'status', 'about', 'service', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'theft', 'thugs', 'churchmen', 'greedy', 'storekeepers', 'lack', 'food', 'clothing', 'shelter', 'loneliness', 'times', 'anger', 'shaky', 'faith', 'church', 'government', 'assert', 'lepers', 'are', 'receiving', 'help', 'other', 'often', 'Damien', 'neither.David', 'Wenham', 'Father', 'Damien', 'convincingly', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'always', 'exceptional', 'dying', 'Anglican', 'whom', 'Father', 'Damien', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'get', 'picture', 'Damien', 'personal', 'struggles', 'as', 'sharply', 'could', 'why', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'instance', 'when', 'Damien', 'told', 'back', 'island', 'will', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'there', 'Damien', 'flinches', 'not', 'hesitate', 'do', 'duty', 'movie', 'end', 'Damien', 'discovers', 'have', 'leprosy', 'see', 'more', 'struggles', 'supervisor', 'hierarchy', 'marrying', 'repentant', 'thug', 'live-in', 'divorced', 'girlfriend.It', 'good', 'movie', 'shared', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'heart', 'Amistad', 'did', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'good', 'show', 'youth', 'group', 'intense', 'love', 'God', 'man', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'possess', 'prostitution', 'scarring', 'one', 'attempted', 'seduction', 'scene', 'parents', 'may', 'wish', 'show', 'older', 'members', 'family', 'little', 'ones', 'are', 'bed', 'even', 'non-Catholics', 'need', 'heroes', 'Father', 'Damien', 'love', 'God', 'compassion', 'suffering', 'people', 'inspire', 'love', 'God', 'serve', 'others', 'more']",N/A

554517,A2P2JXU9JEYNV3,B00004WC7G,"Marian M. Matsunaga ""karma""","[1, 2]","""Molokai"" is not so much about Father Damian, as it is about the importance of compassion towards those, who find themselves as ""unfortunates"" through no fault of their own. That Father Damian defied his superiors in defense of the lepers sent to the then remote island colony on Molokai, says volumes about the man's convictions on their account. He spent years among them, improving their standard of living (which was best described as ""squalor"", before his arrival), and bringing many into the fold of Christianity, before succumbing to the disease himself.Sam Neil, Peter O'Toole and Kris Kristofferson give fine performances.

554526,A27A3AZA7L12N6,B00004WC7G,Stephen M. Bauer,"[157, 165]","Molokai is the story of a priest, Father Damien, who chose to spend his life serving in a leper colony.  The movie is a heroic story of great compassion and persistence in the face of physical hardship and isolation.  Filmed on location on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai, the scenery is gorgeous, and it touches on the history and culture of Hawaii.  I found the movie very, very moving, but some may find the conditions of the lepers too depressing to bear.An Australian, David Wehan plays the role of Damien.  Two other actors you may recognize are Kris Kristofferson and Peter O'Toole, who both play lepers.  Peter O'Toole, who I never like previously, seems to have really enjoyed his role.Molokai is one of the more remote Hawaiian Islands.  During a leprosy epidemic in Hawaii during the mid-nineteenth century, the government established a peninsula on the island of Molokai as a leper colony.  It was chosen because it was so difficult to get to or escape from.In the movie, there is a scene where, instead of transferring the lepers to rowboats, the crew forced the lepers at gunpoint to jump overboard and swim to shore.  These included women and children.  In the actual historical incident, some people drowned, some died from injuries from being bashed against the rocks on the beach, and others died on shore of exhaustion.  Although not shown in the movie, often, ships depositing lepers would tie a rope from the ship to land and the lepers had to climb hand-over-hand to shore.Father Damien had grown up on a farm in Belgium.  He was very strong physically and was an experienced carpenter and builder. Before going to Molokai, the historical Father Damien had been a parish priest and pastor in several parishes in the Hawaiian Islands.  He learned to speak Hawaiian and understood native Hawaiian culture. In the opening sequence of the movie, Father Damien is shown helping some Hawaiians build a house.  Bounty hunters arrive on horseback to take away suspected lepers.  Villagers run and hide.  The scene is reminiscent of the slave catchers in Roots.  Historically, before going to Molokai, Damien experienced parishioners being taken away to the colony, and he had assisted people in avoiding the bounty hunters (not shown in the movie).Father Damien volunteered to be assigned to Molokai.  Damien's bishop instructed him to take all measures to avoid infection.  In the movie, we see Damien simply ignoring the instructions.  In historical fact, after two months on the island, he formally requested permission from the bishop to risk infection.  He did this because it was the only way he could gain the lepers trust.The leper colony was a living hell.  When Damien arrived in 1873, there were six hundred lepers with inadequate housing and food, and no doctors, nurses, or medical supplies.  Essentially, there was no law.  Gangs of physically able lepers looted the belongings of the very sick.  Prostitution and pedophilia were rampant.  The bodies of the dead were either thrown into a ravine or buried very shallowly, where they were dug up and eaten by wild pigs.  To be sure, with the arrival of Damien, there was a significant improvement in the lives of the lepers, but in the historical reality, the conditions and problems Damien faced were far worse than depicted in the movie.Besides serving as priest, Damien's construction worker skills were invaluable.  He built, supervised, or organized volunteer labor to build hundreds of buildings-over half the buildings in the settlement.  When he arrived, there was no running water.  He built a pipeline (In the movie, there is no pipeline).  Damien cleaned and bandaged wounds and amputated gangrenous limbs.  The son of a farmer, he taught the lepers to grow crops (not shown in the movie).  He was the island's undertaker, funeral director, grave digger, and coffin maker-he built over 1,600 coffins.  He also witnessed seven murders (not shown in the movie).Besides having no resources to care for the sick, Damien had constant conflicts with both the government health authorities and his own religious order.  In addition, he had many critics in the medical and clerical professions.  The Hawaiian government's board of health didn't like him simply because he made them look bad.  He alone was accomplishing orders of magnitude more for the lepers than the whole state government.  His religious order was not able to provide any other permanent people to help, until near the end of his life.  To their credit, they tried, but the only other people they could get to go to Molokai were misfits that were so bad, Damien sent them back.  The order had other priests in Hawaii doing good work, and they didn't like Damien getting all the publicity.Father Damien did not go to the leper colony just care for their bodies, although he did so tirelessly.  He also went to save their souls.  In the movie, it is very moving to see Damien administer the Sacraments.  He buries lepers with half-bodies of rotting flesh, with all of the dignity and respect that one would expect to be given a member of high society in Paris or Rome.  Actual historical witnesses on Molokai said that Damien said Mass every day with the utmost reverence and liturgical decorum in a tiny chapel filled with lepers bleeding and spitting, with Damien seemingly oblivious to an almost unbearable stench of rotting human flesh.Since 1944, medicines have been developed that stop leprosy from being contagious and spreading within the body.  The colony on Molokai was disbanded in 1969.  At the time of the filming, there were forty-seven surviving patients from the settlement.  Today, they are free to come and go as they please, although they all feel like outcasts shunned by society.  A number appeared as extras in the movie.  Today, Hawaiians consider Damien to be one of the great heroes of their state.",4,Moving Drama about a Servant of God,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,5870,"['Molokai', 'story', 'priest', 'Father',

554527,A2KBF2OYR359AJ,B00004WC7G,"Steven R. McEvoy ""MCWPP""","[55, 56]","This biography of Father Damien, the Catholic priest who in 1873 volunteered for service on the Hawaiian leper colony of Molokai. For 15 years Damien ministered nearly single-handedly to the quarantined community, supplying what medication he could procure while struggling against the red tape from organizations (religious and governmental) that would rather have forgotten all about the thousands of people dying in primitive conditions. He won some battles and lost others, finally succumbing to the disease himself in 1888.The films earnestness led to the who's-who supporting cast (Sam Neill, Derek Jacobi, Peter O'Toole, Leo McKern, Kate Ceberano and Kris Kristofferson), but it is David Wenham who must carry the film as Damien, which he does spectacularly and with a touching humility, but with the spirit to fight for those he serves, in the midst of such conflict. Director Paul Cox was inspired in his choices of choosing scenes to highlight 15 years in a single film not two hours long. He uses amazing cinematographic tools to convey the story and the passage of time, a tree stand planted by Damien, the many construction projects he carries out, and watching `Little Bishop' grow up and pass away. Pay particular attention to the music, and the use of the sound of the wind as the film progresses.This is a story of faith and of service. If you want a film that will challenge your spirit and cause you to examine your own life in the light of the service given by others you could not pick a better film.The Toronto Globe and Mail stated about the film ""A Triumph of the Human Spirit!""

554528,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00004WC7G,stoic,"[3, 3]","""Father Damien"" is an excellent biopic on the Roman Catholic priest who agreed to live his life among the lepers of Molokai in Hawai'i. The film will cause viewers to ask themselves many questions about the value of sacrifice for one's fellow human beings.There are many positive aspects of ""Father Damien."" The entire cast is excellent; David Wenham, as Damien, rises to the challenge of portraying an extraordinary figure. The film is beautiful; it seems as though it would be easy to film a beautiful movie in Hawai'i, but the filmmakers exceeded my expectations. The wonderful Hawaiian music that the filmmakers used helps provide the right atmosphere.It is possible to mention a few drawbacks. At two hours, the film is a bit long; I thought that the filmmakers could have cut at least fifteen minutes without losing much impact. ""Father Damien"" covers both Damien's activities on Molokai and the (disappointing) actions of the Roman Catholic Church in Honolulu; at times, the filmmakers' attempts to tell two stories at once can be a bit jarring to the viewer.I've never been entirely comfortable with the idea of elevating people to sainthood. But, if anyone deserves such an honor, certainly Father Damien qualifies.

The movie was about a extremely caring priest who came to a dismal place (Molokai) for people with leprosy and greatly improved the conditions.  He struggled with the church and the government regarding funding.
