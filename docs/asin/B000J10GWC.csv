Series 3, 4, and 5 are long overdue, but well worth the wait, the dvd transfer is top rate.However, I rate the disc case ONE star.  Open carefully, all the discs will be loose.  The package design seems good, but obviously a machine (or person) did not load it properly, as the discs were not locked in as the design provided.  Perhaps this is why Amazon's stock disappeared???",5,BEWARE of Disc Case,1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,449,"['rate', 'series', 'FIVE', 'Star', 'Excellent', 'production', 'family', 'Series', '3', '4', '5', 'are', 'long', 'overdue', 'well', 'wait', 'dvd', 'transfer', 'top', 'rate.However', 'rate', 'disc', 'case', 'ONE', 'star', 'Open', 'carefully', 'discs', 'will', 'be', 'loose', 'package', 'design', 'good', 'obviously', 'machine', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'load', 'properly', 'discs', 'were', 'not', 'locked', 'design', 'provided', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'Amazon', 'stock', 'disappeared']",N/A

It's too bad this show was not available to the prime time audience in the USA when it was first conceived.  Brightens any day and one thing I especially love is the vehicles in show.  So gorgeous and especially the bus stands out as a great mode of transportation from town to town.Highly recommend Wind At My Back to any movie buff for it is a treasure!,5,PERFECT FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,493,"['series', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'writing', 'excellent', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'portrayed', 'bad', 'one', 'bunch', 'too', 'bad', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'prime', 'time', 'audience', 'USA', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'conceived', 'Brightens', 'day', 'one', 'thing', 'especially', 'love', 'vehicles', 'show', 'So', 'gorgeous', 'especially', 'bus', 'out', 'great', 'mode', 'transportation', 'town', 'town.Highly', 'recommend', 'Wind', 'My', 'Back', 'movie', 'buff', 'treasure']",N/A
