But with Vincent Price, it certainly could have been.In this film Price plays Gallico, an aspiring magician but one who has been thwarted by his employer, Ross Ormond, who wants him to continue designing stage illusions for him to sell to famous magicians. Something in Gallico snaps and he murders Ormond. He murders his ex-wife (who was seduced by Ormond and married him) and murders the Great Rinaldi, a stage magician who hopes to keep Gallico working for him through blackmail. Gallico has pefected a system of masks which allows him to convincingly disguise himself as a number of his victims, but this aspect of the plot is never fully explored. Gallico is supposed to be insane but never really gives that impression.

I love black and white movies,but The Mad Magician suffers slightly to House Of Wax by comparison.I can't help think that if The Mad Magician had been filmed in color,it would be elevated to the level of House Of Wax. Both films starVincent Price and both were released in 3-D, while The Mad Magicianwas a widescreen effort as well.Magician has a very good story to tell with a few twists and turnsand is very enjoyable. Originally, I had dismissed it as an inferiorattempt to re-create the huge success of House Of Wax, but nowI find I was unfair.Cinemascope and 3-D were Hollywood's answer to poor attendanceat the movies due to the enormous popularity of TV. However,3-D's popularity only lasted from 1953-1954, but made a big revivalin the last ten years or so.The DVD release of The Mad Magician is presented in the widescreenformat and the black and white picture quality is excellent.House Of Wax and The Mad Magician would make a great double feature.Decide for yourself which is more enjoyable.",4,Vincent Price Strikes Again!,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,1093,"['Mad', 'Magician', 'Columbia', '1954', 'very', 'close', 'relative', 'toHouse', 'Wax', 'Warners', '1953', 'love', 'black', 'white', 'movies', 'Mad', 'Magician', 'slightly', 'House', 'Wax', 'comparison.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Mad', 'Magician', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'color', 'would', 'be', 'elevated', 'level', 'House', 'Wax', 'films', 'starVincent', 'Price', 'were', 'released', '3-D', 'Mad', 'Magicianwas', 'widescreen', 'effort', 'well.Magician', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'tell', 'few', 'twists', 'turnsand', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Originally', 'had', 'dismissed', 'inferiorattempt', 're-create', 'huge', 'success', 'House', 'Wax', 'nowI', 'find', 'was', 'unfair.Cinemascope', '3-D', 'were', 'Hollywood', 'answer', 'poor', 'attendanceat', 'movies', 'due', 'enormous', 'popularity', 'TV', 'However,3-D', 'popularity', 'only', 'lasted', '1953-1954', 'made', 'big', 'revivalin', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'so.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'Mad', 'Magician', 'presented', 'widescreenformat', 'black', 'white', 'picture', 'quality', 'Wax', 'Mad', 'Magician', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'double', 'feature.Decide', 'yourself', 'more', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Let's earnestly hope The Mad Magician will also be released in 3D. I saw the original 1954 release and, like Vincent Price's 1953 film, this one was very successful with 3D effects. Probably this was the film that cemented Mr. Price's future roles as a horror icon.I'm wondering if the DVD reviewed by others is not cropped to achieve a ""wide screen"" effect as I recollect absolutely NO 3D movie in the '50's also being filmed for CinemaScope release, which would have been most awkward for theaters then to exhibit as the 3D flicks were exhibited utilizing two synchronized projectors. Since few movie theaters had more than a couple of projectors, the 3D movies were sent on extra large reels which necessitated an intermission mid-way to change both reels. When 3D was tried again in the early 1980's, a method had been devised to place the left and right images on one reel.The Mad Magician has lots of nifty action and quite a few items thrown from the screen into your face, the very thing which we children in '53-'54 loved about them!",4,A great 3D thriller:,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1125,"['Recently', 'WB', 'announced', 'October', 'release', 'House', 'Wax', 'bluray', '3D', 'format', 'Let', 'earnestly', 'hope', 'Mad', 'Magician', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'released', '3D', 'saw', 'original', '1954', 'release', 'Vincent', 'Price', '1953', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'successful', '3D', 'effects', 'Probably', 'was', 'film', 'cemented', 'Mr.', 'Price', 'future', 'roles', 'horror', 'icon.I', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'DVD', 'reviewed', 'others', 'not', 'cropped', 'achieve', 'wide', 'screen', 'effect', 'recollect', 'absolutely', 'NO', '3D', 'movie', ""'50"", 'also', 'being', 'filmed', 'CinemaScope', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'awkward', 'theaters', 'then', 'exhibit', '3D', 'flicks', 'were', 'exhibited', 'utilizing', 'two', 'synchronized', 'projectors', 'few', 'movie', 'theaters', 'had', 'more', 'couple', 'projectors', '3D', 'movies', 'were', 'sent', 'extra', 'large', 'reels', 'necessitated', 'intermission', 'mid-way', 'change', 'reels', 'When', '3D', 'was', 'tried', 'again', 'early', '1980', 'method', 'had', 'been', 'devised', 'place', 'left', 'right', 'images', 'one', 'reel.The', 'Mad', 'Magician', 'lots', 'nifty', 'action', 'quite', 'few', 'items', 'thrown', 'screen', 'face', 'very', 'thing', 'children', ""'53-'54"", 'loved']",N/A
