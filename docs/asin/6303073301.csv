It really is a bit camp, and also just plain trashy and sincerely so. There are a number of fascinating trivia items. First of which is the house which Miguel Ferrer visits in Mexico is the ""hotel"" set built for the filming of ""The Night Of The Iguana"". Second, George Clooney appears briefly as a transvestite go-go dancer, in a cage, in a Mexican nightclub scene. Why? Miguel Ferrer is George Clooney's cousin, and he evidently did it as a goof for his cousin, back before Clooney had become ""the sexiest man alive"".",4,Worth watchng to see George Clooney as a transvestite go-go dancer...,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,773,"['Harvest', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'bad', 'really', 'good', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'assuming', 'have', 'appreciation', 'middle', 'night', 'masterpieces', 'cable', 'TV', 'kinds', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'drive', 'see', 'once', 'time', 'really', 'bit', 'camp', 'also', 'just', 'plain', 'trashy', 'sincerely', 'so', 'are', 'number', 'fascinating', 'trivia', 'items', 'First', 'house', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'visits', 'Mexico', 'hotel', 'set', 'built', 'filming', 'Night', 'Iguana', 'Second', 'George', 'Clooney', 'briefly', 'transvestite', 'go-go', 'dancer', 'cage', 'Mexican', 'nightclub', 'scene', 'Why', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'cousin', 'evidently', 'did', 'goof', 'cousin', 'back', 'Clooney', 'had', 'become', 'sexiest', 'man', 'alive']",N/A

As he attempts to return the states, the people responsible want his other kidney.I have never heard of this movie and the plot has been done to death, but there are several twists and turns that kept me interested.

354684,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,6303073301,Jeffery Mingo,"[2, 8]","Two things stand out about this film.First, the actress who played Roxy in ""Basic Instinct"" is the femme fatale in this film.  This film came out one year after ""BI.""  Here Sarrelle (Roxy) talks, moves, and acts like Sharon Stone in ""BI.""  She dances with Miguel Ferrer in a gay club just like Stone did with Michael Douglas.  She ties up Ferrer's hands with a belt like Stone did to Douglas with a white scarf in ""BI.""  She says, ""I like the rain."" ironically just like Stone's Catherine Tremell said, ""I like rough edges."" in ""BI.""  It's sad that an actress is getting type-casted so terribly.Secondly, every male character has a hairy chesty, and I mean Alec Baldwin-hairy.  Yes, most of this film takes place in Mexico where it's so hot that men may keep their shirts unbuttoned.  Still, even characters not in Mexico, like Harvey Fierstein, are hirsute and flaunting it.  The casting director or film director must have a thing for hairy guys.

354686,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,6303073301,Pork Chop,"[1, 5]","THE HARVEST (1993), is the stereotypical ABC / CBS / NBC Sunday nightmovie, that feels like a less filling beer vs. the real thing.Being a typical TV network  evening movie, it has the typical murder,occasional shooting, thrill moments intertwined with a mystery andaction thrown in for good measure, and of course, the plat deresistence, the upper bodily nudity of the Sharon Stone lookalike,Leilani Sarelle who brings up the popular, indispensable libido,erotic element to attract the younger audiences.Much of the featherweight category of HARVEST can be tracked to thechoice of the leading actor, Miguel Ferrer, for the simple reasonthat consistently, the sequences seem totally unrealistic. Hischaracter every single time wins the upper hand in man-to-mancombats, at perhaps 140 lbs, cuts the neck of an agressor, puts asword through one, or even, seduces the supporting actor, played bySarelle in a bar, that wouldn't seem typical of either actors.Annoyingly, the story tells of  the lead character being a bookauthor, working on a  story, all the while having had his kidneystolen from his own body. This aspect is made worse by laterintermixing fantasy and facts, confusing the audience. Despitevictimized, the operated patient manages to escape from his captorsoperating room on a pier, at a tropical Mexican tourist resort,although debilitated. It also isn't explained why Ferrer doesn't callthe police to revisit where the organ theft occurred.If this already made no sense, the movie then has Ferrer trackingdown Sarelle, who from all appearances had been part of thehouse-of-mirrors set up, that got him mugged and lose his kidney.Instead of seeking justice or vindication, he comes back for seconds.A clean bed, home is offered to Ferrer by Sarelle, and they hit itoff, despite the foot-long scar on his back.From a cinematographical viewpoint, there's a TV format, with cleanediting, and the occasional interesting audio, that for the mostpart, can best be categorized as  mediocre, TV-fare.There's also a boorish, redundant UFO, secret projects, conspiracies,and political commentary made by one of Ferrer's friends, sufferingfrom delusions of grandeur and self-importance that clearly shouldhave been edited out.A more serious suggestion, is the existance of an internationalnetwork of organ harvesting members, involving medical doctors on thetake, nurses, small time prostitutes ready to take part in the score,from which the marks lose their organs, all eager to make a few buckson the side, including those under oath to law enforcement.
