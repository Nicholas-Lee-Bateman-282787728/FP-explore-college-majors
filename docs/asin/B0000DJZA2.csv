I'm not sure why or how anyone could give this a good rating.  The plot was flimsy, the acting was poor, the editing was laughable and the ""action"" was almost nonexistent.  I found myself fast forwarding through a good portion of the scenes, wishing they'd just get to the point.  Val's role wasn't as big as I'd hoped, and Christian Slater was weak at best.My suggestion is to rent the movie first if you want to see it that badly (I did because of V. Kilmer), that way if you don't like it you don't waste your money, and if you do like it...well different strokes for different folks.",1,Oh so sad...,1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,698,"['am', 'HUGE', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'fan', 'happen', 'like', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'god', 'awful', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'give', 'good', 'rating', 'plot', 'was', 'flimsy', 'acting', 'was', 'poor', 'editing', 'was', 'laughable', 'action', 'was', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'found', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'good', 'portion', 'scenes', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'just', 'get', 'point', 'Val', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'was', 'weak', 'best.My', 'suggestion', 'rent', 'movie', 'first', 'want', 'see', 'badly', 'did', 'V.', 'Kilmer', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'do', 'well', 'different', 'strokes', 'different', 'folks']",N/A
