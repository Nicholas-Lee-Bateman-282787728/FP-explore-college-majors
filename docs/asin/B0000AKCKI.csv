763754,A1F1FOR46702YF,B0000AKCKI,,"[0, 0]","After a series of dramatic roles, comedian Jim Carrey returns to comedy with the feel-good comedy hit ""Bruce Almighty"". After being denied an anchor position, TV human-interest reporter Bruce Nolan (Carrey) blames God for his misfortunes and God (Morgan Freeman) offers Bruce the opportunity of his life. As the new Big Guy Upstairs, Bruce has the divine powers to change the world and learns the great responsibility that comes with his new job. ""Bruce Almighty"" is an amusing comic romp that marks Carrey's return to box office success. The movie earned over $500 million worldwide and became one of the highest-grossing comedies to date. The concept is imaginative but the film tends to fall short of its true potential. The story is cute but turns sappy toward the end. Director Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura & Liar, Liar) delivers some wildly funny scenes. Carrey's outstanding comic talent is the film's most significant highlight. The cast also includes Jennifer Aniston, Catherine Bell, Steve Carell and Phillip Baker Hall.With ""Bruce Almighty"", Universal offers a worthy DVD. The 2003 hit comedy is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The video transfer is quite good with effective sharpness and nice color detail. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS sound options are positively enjoyable with great clarity. The DVD contains a fine audio commentary with director Tom Shadyac, 30 minutes of hilarious outtakes, 15 deleted scenes and likable interactive menus. Unfortunately, the DVD also includes a few forced trailers of other Universal titles. With its pleasant presentation and decent supplements, ""Bruce Almighty"" gets a satisfying ""B"".",4,In Carrey We Trust,1071360000,"12 14, 2003",2003,1654,"['series', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'comedian', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'comedy', 'feel-good', 'comedy', 'hit', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'being', 'denied', 'anchor', 'position', 'TV', 'human-interest', 'reporter', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'Carrey', 'God', 'misfortunes', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bruce', 'opportunity', 'life', 'new', 'Big', 'Guy', 'Upstairs', 'Bruce', 'divine', 'powers', 'change', 'world', 'great', 'responsibility', 'new', 'job', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'amusing', 'comic', 'romp', 'Carrey', 'return', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'movie', 'earned', '500', 'million', 'worldwide', 'became', 'one', 'highest-grossing', 'comedies', 'date', 'concept', 'imaginative', 'film', 'fall', 'short', 'true', 'potential', 'story', 'cute', 'sappy', 'end', 'Director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'wildly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Carrey', 'outstanding', 'comic', 'talent', 'film', 'most', 'significant', 'highlight', 'cast', 'also', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Phillip', 'Baker', 'Hall.With', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Universal', 'worthy', 'DVD', '2003', 'hit', 'comedy', 'presented', '1.85:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'format', 'video', 'transfer', 'quite', 'good', 'effective', 'sharpness', 'nice', 'color', 'detail', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'DTS', 'sound', 'options', 'are', 'positively', 'enjoyable', 'great', 'clarity', 'DVD', 'fine', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', '30', 'minutes', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', '15', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'likable', 'interactive', 'menus', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'also', 'few', 'forced', 'trailers', 'other', 'Universal', 'titles', 'pleasant', 'presentation', 'decent', 'supplements', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'satisfying', 'B']",Bruce Almighty
763755,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B0000AKCKI,,"[0, 0]","All in all, this is a funny, entertaining film that showcases its cast's talent well. While there is little actual substance here, and we can all guess the story's twists and turns well ahead of time, part of the fun is that we know the story and we know the likely outcome, but Jim Carrey takes us on the journey and we're never quite sure which particular road he's going to take to get us there.Naturally, Bruce undergoes a spiritual and emotional journey throughout the film - it's somewhat cliche, but it works here. Jim Carrey is absolutely hysterical - he was built from the ground up for wild and wicked comedic roles, and his facial expression and over-the-top physical comedy stunts are fantastic. Morgan Freeman's God is warm, comforting, fatherly, witty, humorous and generally wonderful in ways only Morgan Freeman can be. Jennifer Aniston is her usual adorable self, and does a good job as Grace.&quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; centers around, strangely enough, a fellow named &quot;Bruce.&quot; Bruce cannot catch a break to save his life - despite working hard as the &quot;fluff&quot; reporter for the local evening news program (covering the local bakery or cutesy-poo stories,) when it comes time to select a new anchor person, he is passed over for an obnoxious, smarmy desk jockey. This, as far as Bruce is concerned, is the last straw between himself and God - he rants and rails at God, demanding an explanation. When God begins to manifest himself to Bruce, Bruce has no clue what's going on, and ignores him. At last, God (played so very well by Morgan Freeman) manages to get his attention, and Bruce is bestowed with all of God's powers - since Bruce is so convinced he could run things better, God gives him that chance. Bruce's nature, however, is not to help people - at least not initially.At first, he's pretty darned wicked and entranced by his own powers. Hilarity ensues, of course, and one of the funniest scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie occurs when Bruce takes his vengeance upon aforementioned smarmy anchorman. Soon, however, Bruce realizes that he's in waaaayyyy over his head, after his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) leaves him, the city of Buffalo riots, prayer emails come in on the order of millions per hour and things generally don't go as planned, so God makes several appearances to help steer him in the right direction. Once the floor is all mopped up, so to speak, and things settle down, Bruce realizes (of course) that being God is difficult work, indeed, and best left to the professional.The DVD extras are entertaining, showing &quot;The Process of Jim,&quot; which gives us a sneak peek into how Jim gets a scene the way he wants it, ad-libbing all over the place, doing impromptu comedy with bakery implements, cracking up the cast and crew - very good stuff. The outtakes and deleted scenes are also very funny and interesting, and include director commentary that one can turn off and on.I recommend this highly to any Jim Carrey fan, and in general to anyone looking for a little mindless fluff comedy to pass a couple of hours.",3,"Moments of full belly laughs, and the rest is amusing",1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,3092,"['funny', 'entertaining', 'film', 'cast', 'talent', 'well', 'little', 'actual', 'substance', 'here', 'can', 'guess', 'story', 'twists', 'well', 'ahead', 'time', 'part', 'fun', 'know', 'story', 'know', 'likely', 'outcome', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'journey', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'particular', 'road', 'going', 'take', 'get', 'there.Naturally', 'Bruce', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'journey', 'film', 'somewhat', 'cliche', 'here', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'was', 'built', 'ground', 'up', 'wild', 'wicked', 'comedic', 'roles', 'facial', 'expression', 'over-the-top', 'physical', 'comedy', 'stunts', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'God', 'warm', 'comforting', 'fatherly', 'witty', 'humorous', 'generally', 'wonderful', 'ways', 'only', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'can', 'be', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'usual', 'adorable', 'self', 'good', 'job', 'Grace.', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'quot', 'centers', 'strangely', 'enough', 'fellow', 'named', 'quot', 'Bruce.', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'can', 'not', 'catch', 'break', 'save', 'life', 'working', 'hard', 'quot', 'quot', 'reporter', 'local', 'evening', 'news', 'program', 'covering', 'local', 'bakery', 'cutesy-poo', 'stories', 'when', 'time', 'select', 'new', 'anchor', 'person', 'passed', 'obnoxious', 'smarmy', 'desk', 'jockey', 'as', 'far', 'Bruce', 'concerned', 'last', 'straw', 'God', 'God', 'demanding', 'explanation', 'When', 'God', 'manifest', 'Bruce', 'Bruce', 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'last', 'God', 'played', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'get', 'attention', 'Bruce', 'bestowed', 'God', 'powers', 'Bruce', 'so', 'convinced', 'could', 'run', 'things', 'better', 'God', 'chance', 'Bruce', 'nature', 'however', 'not', 'help', 'people', 'least', 'not', 'initially.At', 'first', 'pretty', 'darned', 'wicked', 'entranced', 'own', 'powers', 'Hilarity', 'course', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'movie', 'when', 'Bruce', 'vengeance', 'upon', 'aforementioned', 'smarmy', 'anchorman', 'Soon', 'however', 'Bruce', 'waaaayyyy', 'head', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'city', 'Buffalo', 'riots', 'prayer', 'emails', 'come', 'order', 'millions', 'hour', 'things', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'God', 'several', 'appearances', 'help', 'steer', 'right', 'direction', 'floor', 'mopped', 'up', 'so', 'speak', 'things', 'settle', 'down', 'Bruce', 'course', 'being', 'God', 'difficult', 'work', 'indeed', 'best', 'left', 'professional.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'entertaining', 'showing', 'quot', 'Process', 'Jim', 'quot', 'sneak', 'peek', 'how', 'Jim', 'scene', 'way', 'ad-libbing', 'place', 'doing', 'impromptu', 'comedy', 'bakery', 'implements', 'cracking', 'up', 'cast', 'crew', 'very', 'good', 'stuff', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'interesting', 'include', 'director', 'commentary', 'one', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'on.I', 'recommend', 'highly', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'general', 'anyone', 'looking', 'little', 'mindless', 'fluff', 'comedy', 'pass', 'couple', 'hours']",Bruce Almighty
763756,A1E6WSA8D7QW0M,B0000AKCKI,,"[0, 0]","""Bruce Almighty"" is hysterically funny and yet poignant.  The film will surprise you with its scope and depth along with its comedy.  Jim Carrey incorporates his normal comedic style with a range of other emotions from happy-go-lucky, to frustrated, to selfish, to understand and then to very loving.  Bruce Nolan (Carrey) frustrated with his television career on Buffalo's Channel 7 News thinks God isn't being fair by not allowing him to get the anchor position.  On an open highway in the middle of the night Bruce challenges God outright about the way He's running his life.  Accepting the challenge, God decides to introduce Himself to Bruce by paging him to come to an empty warehouse.  Upon meeting, God proposes giving Bruce all His powers to run the world.  Believing this to be a piece of cake, Bruce doesn't anticipate the many aspects of being God like the millions of prayers that need to be answered or the egotistical wants that need to be refused.  Bruce also learns that with power come responsibility and consequence.  Jennifer Aniston is Grace the girlfriend and a day care center teacher.  This role is not a great stretch for Aniston, but who other than Morgan Freeman could get away with playing God.

763757,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0000AKCKI,,"[0, 0]","""Bruce Almighty"" is not a bad film it's just not a particularly great one.  It's fitfully amusing but not consistently so.  The plot concerns a frustrated newsman who is granted god-like powers from the Almighty and finds out omnipotence is not all it's cracked up to be.  I don't want to say that Jim Carrey is sleepwalking his way through the title role but let's just say it appears he is marking time.  This is the kind of role that Carrey can do in his sleep and it's obvious that he knows that this part is not a particular stretch for him.  My theory is that Carrey took this part to maintain his standing in the box office after the commercial and critical failure of ""The Majestic"".  After working with esteemed directors like Peter Weir, Milos Forman, Ron Howard, and Frank Darabont how can he return to a journeyman like Tom Shadyac?  Morgan Freeman is adequate in the role of God but he's got to find a part that will deliver him that elusive Oscar.  Jennifer Aniston is solid as Bruce's long suffering girlfriend, but then, she is just starting to establish a film career.

763761,A2TWIZ33KJCQ54,B0000AKCKI,,"[0, 0]","CARREY WOULD HAVE TO BE GOD TO MAKE SOME OF THESE PRANKS BELIEVABLE!There are parts of this film, particularly in the beginning and then immediately after Bruce becomes Almighty, that are funny and fun beyond belief. But then, as we look around we see a lack of growth by the character [Bruce - Jim Carrey] at a point in the film where we'd expect him to 'get it' and have some kind of epiphany. The epiphany, when it does comes, comes in the form of devotion to the overlooked woman who has been praying for him all along, but it feels like it is too little too late.Narcissism seems to dominate 'Bruce Almighty' and it comes without enough balance thus making Bruce appear to be what he really would be like if he were god; a vain, selfish, lazy, hateful and vengeful god. Hardly the improvement the Bruce seemed to be promising when it all began!MEDIOCRITY: A STATE OF MINDPut simply, Bruce Nolan [Carrey] is dissatisfied with his life and feels it lacks meaning. ""Mediocre"" is the way Bruce described it. After complaining to god about everything he could think of that pertains to him and him alone, he gets to meet god and is endowed with god's powers so that he [Bruce] can set things right in his own way, presumably a better way.The problem is that Bruce has the same character flaws that he had before he was god and thus uses his power for his own self-indulgences which are rather mean spirited and narcissistic. He creates his own news, gets even with bullies, turns on his girl friend, Grace, [Jennifer Aniston] and literally pulls the full moon closer for its romantic effect.BUT . . . . . . . the effects that all of his actions have on others is almost universally harmful. Creating news by having a meteor strike near him while the camera was running did no one but Bruce any good. Even his lazy way of answering prayers but simply typing YES on his computer to all 3+ million of them had harmful effects. This is the point of the film where Bruce should have been starting to smarten up, but instead Bruce just indulged himself until he found that these shallow, petty self-indulgences were NOT improving his life or at least the way it felt to him. Still, Bruce never really demonstrated a change of attitudes while endowed with god's powers and never showed any real charity or caring toward others until Grace left him [except in deleted scenes].MY TAKE ON 'BRUCE ALMIGHTY'Well all of this would certainly be acceptible except that Jim Carrey seems to be asking us to take this film and its content completely seriously. 'Bruce Almighty' is at times very funny. My personal favorite scene, is Scene 11 on the DVD where Evan Baxter, [Steve Carell] spends two full minutes as a televised news anchor saying whatever Bruce felt like having the man that stole his job opportunity say and do, in order to demean and discredit him. This scene basically sums up the film, parts of it are hilarious but we are left in the second half looking for meaning that never really comes because Bruce's only real epiphany comes in the form of the loss of Grace, [Jennifer Aniston] who had cared for him rather unselfishly all along.ABOUT GOD: MORGAN FREEMAN SHOWS RATHER THAN TELLS & DOES IT LIKE A GODMorgan Freeman as god was terrific and wonderfully understated. He seemed to portray the idea that less is more where god's intervention is concerned. He also displayed infinite patience with Bruce and managed to keep a kind of mystical persona in all of his appearances, but especially in his last, where we were introduced with the notion that all or part of this was a kind of dream or perhaps not. Freeman's powerful presence coupled with Carrey's frenetic energy made for the most intense scenes in the film.-----> THE PRINCIPAL CAST [DIRECTED BY: TOM SHADYAC]Jim Carrey - Bruce NolanJennifer Aniston - GraceMorgan Freeman - GodPhilip Baker Hall - Jack KellerCatherine Bell - Susan OrtegaLisa Ann Walter - DebbieSteve Carell - Evan BaxterNora Dunn - Ally LomanSally Kirkland - Anita MannTony Bennett - Himself-----> AWARDSBest Supporting Actor (win) Morgan Freeman 2004 NAACP Image AwardsDVD SPECIAL FEATURES:OUT-TAKES, DELETED SCENES, & 'THE PROCESS OF JIM' FEATURETTE*---> 'THE DELETED SCENES', I felt some of the deleted scenes should have been included in the film because they gave the impression that Bruce had more of an epiphany and was growing as a human being into someone we could have more empathy with. We did see Bruce doing thoughtful things for others in some of these scenes and I can't help wondering why they were cut -- except for the running time of the film!*---> 'THE OUT-TAKES', nice to see once, but they are something we have grown rather familiar with around Jim Carrey. Nothing new here, but there are some funny things to see and will be especially appreciated by Carrey's fans.*---> ''THE PROCESS OF JIM' FEATURETTE, interesting though short, Jim Carrey is obviously having some fun here.CONCLUSION: A PROMISING CARREY VEHICLE WITH SOME 'REEL' HOOTS'Bruce Almighty' is a must see for Jim Carrey fans, though not his best work. Carrey again tries to be taken at face value, as in 'The Truman Show', but that is a rather hard sell with the director of 'Liar Liar', and 'Ace Ventura Pet Detective' sterring the project. Still, the film has a wonderful theme, Carrey is always full of explosively energetic fun and he's got Morgan Freeman as god and Jennifer Aniston as Grace, to pray for him.",4,PROVOCATIVE PLOT AND JIM

Last time I checked this was a goofball comedy, with Jim Carrey for God's sake (pun unintended), so it's unclear where the issue comes from. I cannot be any more certain than these nice folks, but I suspect our dear Supreme Being sports a better sense of humor than to consider some innocuous comedy at his expense a sacrilege.On to the film. It's a funny little farce for what it is, rich on computer graphics and creative gags that are by and large well done. Nice to see Jim Carrey return to his customary high jinks, the kind that exalted Liar Liar or Dumb & Dumber to their cult status. Freeman makes for an interesting choice to play Him, his demeanor in what little screen time he's accorded has the kind of savoir faire one would expect from the role. Jennifer Aniston settles for the girlfriend bit - messing around with toddlers, obsessesing over photo albums, generally reacting to Bruce's zany stunts, but I'd say she plays it with enough conviction to make us feel her personal crises when they come about.It's clearly a Jim Carrey vehicle but for all its light heartedness I think there's a discrete point about three-fourths into the film where the story gets chick-flick sappy. It could have evolved in several ways, for instance with Bruce employing his powers to get at loggerheads with the real God and such, but the film takes the mainstream road - it does everything it might be ""supposed"" to do.I found it ordinary on my first viewing but having seen it again I think it plays well as a campy summer comedy -- some hearty laughs, couple of good characters, and an agreeable day 'at the movies'.

Turns out-- it WAS funny.Jim Carrey stars as Bruce Nolan a human interest TV Reporter in Buffalo, NY at a crossroads. In a bit of life parallel maybe (wanting to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor while being wildly hilarious??), Nolan's high ratings and beautiful girlfriend Grace (well played by Jennifer Aniston), are not enough as feels he is due something bigger & better as he awaits a possible promotion to station anchor.In a wildly funny, angry & poignant moment (we all have been there) Carrey's Nolan angrily lashes out at God -- and the Almighty (HILARIOUSLY portrayed by the ever-suave Morgan Freeman) responds, endowing Bruce with all of His divine powers. And from there, the movie just takes off with Carrey given free-license to be a comedically-selfish almighty.Shenanigans at the station, romantic-goofing around with Grace & potty-training the dog, all lend to another fine outing from director Tom Shadyac who let Carrey run amok in Ace Ventura as well as Liar, Liar.

I found them cheesy and predictable, so I'm sure you can understand why I was quite skeptical about watching Bruce Almighty. But it was well worth the risk.This is a very entertaining film that opens just as any other Jim Carey type of movie, but turns into more than that. The film is funny, enthralling, but the light drama about self-discovery, faith and prayer is what stands out above all. The film was directed by veteran comedy filmmaker Tom Shadyac, who also directed Carey in Ace Ventura (a film which I hated immensely); Pet Detective and Liar, Liar. In addition to Carey, the whole cast is solid with Morgan Freeman as God and Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's dedicated girlfriend.Carey plays television reporter Bruce Nolan, who is always looking to make it to the big top as Buffalo, New York's nightly anchorman. However, Bruce is always stuck with side stories that he enjoys doing, but wants more. He is continually supported by his sweet school teacher girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), who just wants happiness. As the film opens, one bad thing after another happens to Bruce including losing his job, and he blames God for picking on him.The next thing he knows is he is summoned and encounter by God (Morgan Freeman), who endows Bruce with all of his powers, since he believes he can do better. With the powers, Bruce walks on water, gets a flashy car, and makes his dog use the toilet among other things. However, when things get out of hand due to his self-indulging choices of his new powers, instead of helping others, he turns back to God for answers.Bruce Almighty is a light comedy with the force of Jim Carrey that is better than what it first perceives to be.",5,HE'S GOT THE POWER!!!!,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,1790,"['have', 'be', 'honest', 'child', 'used', 'love', 'films', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'hit', '12', 'hated', 'found', 'cheesy', 'predictable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'quite', 'skeptical', 'watching', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'was', 'well', 'risk.This', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'just', 'other', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'type', 'movie', 'more', 'film', 'funny', 'enthralling', 'light', 'drama', 'self-discovery', 'faith', 'prayer', 'what', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'veteran', 'comedy', 'filmmaker', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Carey', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'film', 'hated', 'immensely', 'Pet', 'Detective', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'addition', 'Carey', 'whole', 'cast', 'solid', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'God', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Bruce', 'dedicated', 'girlfriend.Carey', 'television', 'reporter', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'who', 'always', 'looking', 'make', 'big', 'top', 'Buffalo', 'New', 'York', 'nightly', 'anchorman', 'However', 'Bruce', 'always', 'stuck', 'side', 'stories', 'doing', 'more', 'continually', 'supported', 'sweet', 'school', 'teacher', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'just', 'happiness', 'film', 'one', 'bad', 'thing', 'Bruce', 'including', 'losing', 'job', 'God', 'picking', 'him.The', 'next', 'thing', 'summoned', 'encounter', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'Bruce', 'powers', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'powers', 'Bruce', 'walks', 'water', 'flashy', 'car', 'dog', 'toilet', 'other', 'things', 'However', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'due', 'self-indulging', 'choices', 'new', 'powers', 'instead', 'helping', 'others', 'back', 'God', 'answers.Bruce', 'Almighty', 'light', 'comedy', 'force', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'better', 'what', 'first', 'be']",Bruce Almighty

This of course leads to a meeting with God himself (Morgan Freeman).  God is tired of the complaints.  Since Bruce keeps saying he can do a better job, God gives him the change by giving his powers to him.At first Bruce takes selfish advantage of his powers.

Bestowing Jim Carrey with godlike powers is a ripe recipe for comedy, and Bruce Almighty delivers the laughs that Carrey's mainstream fans prefer. The high-concept premise finds Carrey playing Bruce Nolan, a frustrated Buffalo TV reporter, stuck doing puff-pieces while a lesser colleague gets the anchor job he covets. Bruce demands an explanation from God, who pays him a visit (in the serene form of Morgan Freeman) and lets Bruce take over while he takes a brief vacation. What does a petty, angry guy do when he's God? That's where Carrey has a field day, reuniting with his Ace Ventura and Liar, Liar director, Tom Shadyac, while Jennifer Aniston gamely keeps pace as Bruce's put-upon fianc&eacute;e.

763775,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0000AKCKI,,"[0, 0]","Personally, Bruce Almighty is my favorite Jim Carrey comedy ever. It's never outlandish in its approach, and at times, it's quite serious and adult. Carrey plays the role of Bruce Nolan, a local television reporter always assigned to cover the less than thrilling events in and around his town. Dreaming of one day attaining the anchor's chair, he works hard to shed his funny guy image.Bruce lives with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but the two get into a fight when Bruce (who finds out he lost his bid for anchorman to the underhanded Evan Baxter) flies off the handle and loses his job. Unhappy with his life, and constantly blaming God for it, Bruce is mad at the world. In the interim, he continues to receive numerous pages from an unknown phone number. When he calls the number, he's offered an interview for the job of his life. Curious, Bruce attends the interview in an all-white building where he's confronted by a mysterious janitor who turns out to be God (Morgan Freeman).God confronts Bruce with all the complaints he's made, and then he makes a surprising offer. God is going to let Bruce take his job for two weeks. God will go on vacation, and Bruce will be granted all of God's powers. The result is absolutely hilarious. Bruce begins by parting his tomato soup and proclaiming himself Bruce Almighty! He then succeeds in being the only reporter in town to happen upon the biggest story of the year - the uncovering of Jimmy Hoffa's body. Inserting himself into amazing story after amazing story, Bruce quickly gets his old job back and climbs the ranks of the newsroom. After sabotaging co-worker Evan's career, Bruce is even given the anchor position.But along the way, his relationship with Grace starts falling apart, and the world around him edges closer to anarchy as the powers of God become too much for Bruce to handle. Desperate, Bruce experiences near death and meets with God once again. Acknowledging the difficulty of God's job, Bruce prays for Grace to be happy. God grants his wish, and Bruce is revived - brought to life with a new, fresh perspective to live happily ever after with Grace by his side...Some of the scenes in this film are beyond description, they're so funny. Bruce Almighty is more than just a comedy, it interacts with the audience by making them imagine themselves in Bruce's shoes.

763782,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0000AKCKI,,"[0, 0]","When Bruce Almighty first came out, we skipped it. Although I do think Jim Carrey can be funny, he's a one-note joke. Like Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell, he's funny when the script matches his particular talents. When it doesn't...he's not.There's something of a theme to Carrey scripts: a situation gives him the ability to be crazily elastic - The Mask, The Grinch, and Batman Forever being prime examples. He's a living cartoon. He makes funny faces. He's funny, get it?Carrey IS funny. I loved him in the Mask, hated him in the Grinch, and felt bad for him in Batman Forever. Bruce Almighty falls somewhere in the middle - it has a theme with pretty serious implications but it never rises above a Jim Carrey vehicle where he gets to be goofy and make funny faces.The problem with Bruce Almighty is that it's about faith minus the religion. Which is fine, except that faith is now apparently vague references to God, and that's about it. Call it Bruceology.Which is fine, except Bruce HATES GOD. He doesn't seem to have a valid reason to do so - certainly, there's absolutely no evidence that he's been brought up to believe in God or even care what God thinks. So it's more than a little forced when Bruce begins stomping around claiming, &quot;God hates me!&quot; Bruce seems more like an agnostic or an atheist. But he sure isn't the type to feel God has a personal hatred of him.You can probably guess what happens next: God gives Bruce God-powers over a series of blocks in Boston. What happens next is actually an interesting guide to role-playing a deity, but only gamers think that way. Basically, it's Bruce being selfish in spectacular, God-like fashion and imitating God from movies he probably never saw (and we didn't either). Bruce Almighty smacks of condescension in a way that makes you start to suspect the producers think you're a moron and won't really remember (or never saw) The Ten Commandments or heck, even read the bible.And yet...and yet there is one moment in Bruce Almighty that almost made me pee from laughing so hard. Ironically, the humor comes from Steven Carell playing Evan Baxer, Bruce's archrival for the anchor position on a news show. Over the span of what seems like an eternity, Bruce turns Evan into a gibbering idiot, forcing him to shout in a long, drawn out howl &quot;NEWWWSS!&quot; as if her were afflicted with Tourettes Syndrome. It's something you shouldn't be laughing at...you feel guilty for laughing. But hell, I'm laughing about it now.I've come to the conclusion that someone IMITATING Carrey is actually funnier than Carrey himself.Bruce Almighty has its moments.

That was a time when I was going through some troubling times and blamed GOd for everything. Bruce Almighty came in just the perfect time to teach me several lessons. BA does teach you a couple of lessons. It teaches you that GOd knows what is going on in our lives and everything happens for a reason. In the movie Bruce (Jimm Carrey)feels like the world is against him. He feels like a loser and that nothing is going right for him and hence blames God for his troubles. His girlfriend Grace(Jennifer Aniston) who is somewhat religious confronts him and tells him to trust God anyways and stop complaining. But her words fall in deaf ears. He somehow meets God where God endows him with all his powers and tells him to take charge of his job. Bruce like every selfish human being thinks only about himself. He becomes the I, Me, Myself kind of a guy. He uses his powers to manipulate people and circumstances but then he cannot affect anybodys free will which is the only thing God has given us as our own. Everytime he thinks of answering peoples prayers he does it half heartedly only for the heck of doing it. He doesnt really pay any heed to peoples needs. There are some real touching moments in the movie. Like the time Grace intercedes for Bruce and the time Bruce walks out on the highway all drenched up, crying out to God and saying I surrender to your will. All along Bruce had been a selfish human being but at the end he makes a selfless prayer to GOd for the one person that matters to him the most. The cast is good with Jim carrey, Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman. The movie is funny but with a little profanity. If you want to consider some soul searching the movie is a must see.

He established himself as the big guy in the mid nineties with hits like Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, and Liar Liar. Bruce Almighty is another movie he can add to his list of classic comedies.Bruce Nolan(Carrey) is a struggling news reporter. He hates and likes his job all at the same time. He is working hard to get a promotion to anchor but ends up losing it to rival Evan Baxter(Carell). That drives him over the top and he goes nuts. His girlfriend that he lives with Grace(Aniston) tries to calm him down, but it's all lost. He goes nuts and ends up geting what he wishes for.He ends up meeting the man he blames for all his problems God(Freeman). They talk about Bruce and how his life is going and Bruce still blames God for his problems. God being the wise and omnipotent that he is gives Bruce the chance to do better and gives him his powers and tells him to run the Buffalo area better.Bruce now has the power and goes wild using it to better himself. The better he helps himself the more he hurts the others around him. He is driving Grace further away from him and Buffalo is going nuts because there prayers aren't being answered right. Bruce learns you can't force everything or make it go your way and now he must correct things before it's to late.Jim Carrey is vintage Carrey in this movie. It reunited him with Tom Shadyac who directed Carrey's previous hits Ace Ventura and Liar Liar. It's fun watching Carrey go back to his old slap stick sarcastic ways. The movie really works because he takes the role and runs with it. We all know Jim Carrey is god and we finally get to see him play it. He's not offensive with the part either, and I don't think any religous person could be offended by it, especially with the happy feel good ending.The rest of the actors are there as filling. Aniston was put on the project to add another big name to attract a couple of more people to the seats. She doesn't do anything special with the part, but she doesn't hurt the movie at all. Catherine Bell is her normal hottie self in the movie, but once again thats the only reason they brought her aboard. Steve Carell as Evan is probaly the funniest character outside of Bruce and you will laugh because of him.This is a great movie. It's funny and it's not offensive at all. It has a happy good feel ending that you can actually learn something from it. If you love Jim Carrey you have to pick this one up. No collection of his is complete without it.

However, the twist here is that the concept behind this is so good that you wonder why it hasn't been done before.  Carrey plays Bruce, a put-upon news reporter who doesn't get the anchor position he'd coveted and defies God to make his life any worse than it already is.  Enter Morgan Freeman as God, handing over the reigns to Bruce while he takes a well-earned vacation.The first half of this movie is the most fun, with Bruce parting his tomato soup, creating the perfect romantic evening with girlfriend Grace (Aniston) and facing off with a group of thugs.  Carrey's rubber-faced antics work very well in these scenes and there are some very good jokes along the way - God's last break was apparently the Dark Ages.  Unfortunately it all unravels a bit when the inevitable occurs and Bruce realises that being God isn't as easy as it might first appear.  Unfortunately, rather than discussing more pertinent issues, the only result of Bruce answering 'yes' to all his incoming prayers is a lottery debacle and a power cut.  Strangely enough, a tsunami he caused by lassoing the moon and bringing it to his balcony, is only giving a fleeting reference.  This is all coupled with a hokey resolution where Bruce realises the humility in small deeds and, literally, that all you need is love.  This attempted 'serious' ending not only tries to spoon-feed its audience with simplistic morals, but really lets down the first half of the movie, which really is very funny.  You can't help but feel that the movie should've gone all out simply for fun, or attempted to discuss the wider repurcussions of Bruce's actions as God.  But I guess that might not have packed them into the multiplexes as much as this.Still, the movie (clearly Carrey's longed-for middle ground between the critical acclaim he received for Man In The Moon and the audience-friendly Ace Ventura) did well at the box office and is very funny a lot of the time.

Unlike the Mask however, the storyline here is not as cartoon like and actually deals with some real personal issues, most of us can identify with. Unhappy with his lack of success at work, and generally disatisfied with life, after more than his share of mishaps, Bruce (Carrey) takes to fist waving the almighty, and blaming him for all that is wrong in his life, and the World in general. God, played with laconic sobriety, and more than a little pathos by Morgan Freeman, decides to teach Bruce a lesson by giving him his own job for a few days, to see how he could improve on it, and the results are more than hilarious. The story doesn't however fall into any traps, and balances the humour with some clever, and often poignant lessons for our unlikely hero, along the way, leaving the viewer will a well rounded visual treat.

763815,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B0000AKCKI,,"[0, 2]","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSTITLE: Bruce AlmightyPREMIERED IN: 2003RATED: PG-13RUNNING TIME: 102 MinutesSTARRING: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, Steve CarrelPLOT: A TV news reporter named Bruce (Carrey) is tired of having a ""mediocre life"" and blames all of his problems on God. Needless to say, he suddenly meets God (Freeman) and is given Godlike powers. While Bruce starts to enjoy his newfound glory, his girlfriend Grace (Aniston) is worsening because he is still the same person that he has been: egotistical. 9/10CHARACTERS/PERFORMANCES: Carrey and Aniston are typically brilliant as the troubled couple. Carrel, I believe, steals the show as the antagonist that every news reporter would love to hate. Freeman was absolutely stunning as the humanlike God. He made me feel good about being a Protestant. But let's not forget all the memorable moments of this film. Bruce secretly tormenting new anchorman Evan (Carrel) is memorably hilarious. I don't know how Carrel was able to pull it off. Bruce breaking down on the Maid of the Mist was almost gave me a heart attack! The way he yelled out the word ""eroding"" just made me so happy with laughter. 9/10THE SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: The script was top-notch, with every scene elaborated very nicely. 10/10DIRECTOR: Tom Shadyac proves that he is a good Christian by getting the point across perfectly. There is no hint of biased storytelling anywhere; it just tells about God and the miracles that we control. Shadyac makes the tension throughout the movie flawless as Bruce Nolan starts to tear away the entire Earth whenever he works his magic. He also makes sure that the comedy is never over-the-top, although the drama can be a bit melodramatic at a few points in the movie. All in all, Shadyac does a brilliant job here. 9/10PACING: It's perfectly paced. Nuff said. 9/10CINEMATOGRAPHY: It's all good. There are no flaws in lighting or coloring whatsoever. 9/10SETS AND COSTUMES: It's all modern, so there's nothing special about it. God's suit, however, might symbolize either hope or comfort. 10/10MUSIC: It sounds very nice, although it isn't anything special. The songs (by Mick Jagger, Joan Osbourne, and Fatboy Slim) seem to fit perfectly for this movie. 8/10VISUAL EFFECTS: All the CGI effects look realistic and beautiful. The ""close-up"" of the moon might be the only exception, though. 10/10DVD SPECIAL FEATURES: The deleted scenes and extra outtakes had me in stitches (not literally)! 9/10CONCLUSION: This isn't your typical feel-good comedy, but it does have countless moments that will make you cheer. This is one of the finest comedies that I have seen.OVERALL GRADE: 9.2/10 A-",5,"""I am Bruce Almighty!

However, like Joel McCrea in ""Sullivan's Travels,"" he doesn't see any value in merely getting people's mind off their troubles for a while. He aspires to the anchor job which, instead, goes to his rival, Evan Baxter (""The Daily Show's"" irrepressible Steve Carell).Nothing is going right in Bruce's life, from his job to traffic jams. So he gives God a piece of his mind and God (Morgan Freeman . . . who else?) gives him the chance to do a better job. Bruce is made God-for-the-week, while the Almighty takes a vacation. When Bruce protests that God never takes vacations, the Lord winks, ""Ever heard of the Dark Ages?""Carrey is utterly delightful, whether pulling off some hilarious pratfall or energizing the most mundane piece of dialogue. The casting of Freeman -- the actor most likely to be voted to play God by everyone who makes movies or watches them -- doesn't hurt either. He and Carrey are criminally funny together, playing off each other like a classic vaudeville team.There's some trouble near the finale when the picture doesn't know how to end itself, but that's quickly righted.

On the DVD release, it's chapter 11(the aptly titled ""Bruce's Revenge""), and it still made me laugh to the point of tears.Actually, there's a lot of good material on the DVD, including more outtakes and many deleted scenes. One scene which was cut involves Jennifer Aniston's character in the supermarket; commenting on an actress on the cover of a tabloid, she says people only care about that actress' haircut, which is a clever take on Aniston's own hairstyles over the years while starring on ""Friends"".One change from the theatrical version to the DVD is the scene where Bruce checks his pager to see who's contacting him. The original release of the film used a phone number which turned out to be an actual number in certain areas of the United States. It caused a bit of an uproar when people who had this number were being called relentlessly by more than a few people who'd seen the film. In the DVD release, the phone number's prefix is now the infamous ""555"", which is nonexistent in the real world.Jim Carrey gives one of his most likeable performances, as a down on his luck reporter who acquires the powers of the Man upstairs. Predictably, some crazy events take place, followed by the necessary turn into sentimentality, a-la ""It's A Wonderful Life""( scenes from that film are actually incorporated into ""Bruce Almighty""). Not entirely original, but Carrey, Aniston, and Morgan Freeman as The Man Upstairs manage to give it a fresh spin. It's a frequently funny movie and an excellent DVD with the extra material.

763824,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B0000AKCKI,,"[1, 1]","Dear Almighty! I am in a minority here, but Jim Carrey's latest collaboration with his Ace Ventura and Liar Liar director deserves three marks at best,and this is why,Bruce Almighty is a film tailored for Carrey and his abilities, which by far is not a bad thing, for he is one of the best comedy actors of his generation, but for me personally I can only take as much of his repetitive style of pulling faces and body and facial gymnastics, seen in most of his work.Carrey, especially seen in the outtakes, making ofs and interviews has an incredible and manic energy,a contagious and  funny hyperactivity, and a hilarious unpredictablity, and what we see on screen does not differ greatly from the real person behind the characters he plays: 'method acting' is not something Carrey agonizes over to hit the right spot with his audience.Tom Shadyac is an able comedy director, who has worked well with Carrey and was responsible largely for reviving the box office appeal of Eddie Murphy.Jennifer Aniston, one of the few Friends who successfully crossed over to films, is cute, sweet and a good actress to boostAnd of course, there are very few people who are good enough to play 'God' on screen,and certainly Morgan Freeman is one.But I did find the film's message riddled with cliches about life, priorities, doing good, free will vs fate etc..By all means I do not expect all films to treat the subject of God, Creation and the meaning of life as philosophically as Kubrick,Tarkovsky or Scorsese did, it is after all a light comedy for all the family, nevertheless it was quite predictable, and naively treated.Carrey,a TV reporter pushing on forty, and out of job,complains about his lot in life and blames God for his bad luck. He, however,gets the chance from the Man himself to acquire divine powers to see if he can do better,and predictably enough we see him getting a fancy car and clothes,creating hit stories for his TV comeback,seeking revenge on the 'bad' people from a street gang to a snotty colleague.But with all his new powers he can not easily alter the free will of his girlfriend to come back to him, dumping him after catching him in a compromising position with a sexy anchor (the gorgeous Catherine Bell). This for me is too cliched,sugary and over sentimental to have its desired effect.There are few funny scenes in the film, especially the post it scene, but as one reviewer rightly put it, the before being God segment of the film is much funnier, while the after is pretty uneven.You will still enjoy Bruce Almighty, if you can never tire of Carrey's facial gymnastics,but I know  too that Carrey has another acting side to him equally as brilliant,(the one in The Truman Show).This makes Bruce Almighty and the divine Jim Carrey  a must buy for the faithful only.",3,Divine Carrey for the Faithful Only,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,2795,"['Dear', 'Almighty', 'am', 'minority', 'here', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'latest', 'collaboration', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'director', 'three', 'marks', 'best', 'why', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'film', 'tailored', 'Carrey', 'abilities', 'far', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'one', 'best', 'comedy', 'actors', 'generation', 'personally', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'much', 'repetitive', 'style', 'pulling', 'body', 'facial', 'gymnastics', 'seen', 'most', 'work.Carrey', 'especially', 'seen', 'outtakes', 'making', 'ofs', 'interviews', 'incredible', 'manic', 'energy', 'contagious', 'funny', 'hyperactivity', 'hilarious', 'unpredictablity', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'not', 'differ', 'greatly', 'real', 'person', 'characters', ""'method"", 'acting', 'not', 'something', 'Carrey', 'hit', 'right', 'spot', 'audience.Tom', 'Shadyac', 'able', 'comedy', 'director', 'who', 'worked', 'well', 'Carrey', 'was', 'responsible', 'largely', 'reviving', 'box', 'office', 'appeal', 'Eddie', 'Murphy.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'one', 'few', 'Friends', 'who', 'successfully', 'crossed', 'films', 'cute', 'sweet', 'good', 'actress', 'boostAnd', 'course', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'play', ""'God"", 'screen', 'certainly', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one.But', 'did', 'find', 'film', 'message', 'riddled', 'cliches', 'life', 'priorities', 'doing', 'good', 'free', 'will', 'vs', 'fate', 'means', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'films', 'treat', 'subject', 'God', 'Creation', 'meaning', 'life', 'as', 'philosophically', 'Kubrick', 'Tarkovsky', 'Scorsese', 'did', 'light', 'comedy', 'family', 'nevertheless', 'was', 'quite', 'predictable', 'naively', 'treated.Carrey', 'TV', 'reporter', 'pushing', 'forty', 'job', 'lot', 'life', 'God', 'bad', 'luck', 'however', 'chance', 'Man', 'acquire', 'divine', 'powers', 'see', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'predictably', 'enough', 'see', 'getting', 'fancy', 'car', 'clothes', 'creating', 'hit', 'stories', 'TV', 'comeback', 'seeking', 'revenge', ""'bad"", 'people', 'street', 'gang', 'snotty', 'colleague.But', 'new', 'powers', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'alter', 'free', 'will', 'girlfriend', 'come', 'back', 'dumping', 'catching', 'compromising', 'position', 'sexy', 'anchor', 'gorgeous', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'too', 'cliched', 'sugary', 'sentimental', 'have', 'desired', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'especially', 'post', 'one', 'reviewer', 'rightly', 'put', 'being', 'God', 'segment', 'film', 'much', 'funnier', 'pretty', 'uneven.You', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'can', 'never', 'tire', 'Carrey', 'facial', 'gymnastics', 'know', 'too', 'Carrey', 'acting', 'side', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'one', 'Truman', 'Show', '.This', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'divine', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'must', 'buy', 'faithful', 'only']",Bruce Almighty

Jennifer Aniston is pleasant enough as Bruce's girlfriend and I cried when she prayed to forget him at the end.Truly a cute movie, worthy of 5 stars, but start the DVD 5 minutes before you will actually sit down to watch it",3,Good laughs,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,711,"['thought', 'had', 'endure', '5', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'rented', 'DVD', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'simply', 'reason', '-2', 'stars', 'said', 'think', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'funniest', 'movie', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'rubberface', 'antics', 'are', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'when', 'Steve', 'Corell', 'talk', 'gibberish', 'newscast', 'When', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'powers', 'mostly', 'own', 'gain', 'eventually', 'can', 'not', 'please', 'everybody', 'time', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'Bruce', 'girlfriend', 'cried', 'when', 'prayed', 'forget', 'end.Truly', 'cute', 'movie', 'worthy', '5', 'stars', 'start', 'DVD', '5', 'minutes', 'will', 'actually', 'sit', 'down', 'watch']",Bruce Almighty

763832,AVT2CST57MKDL,B0000AKCKI,,"[1, 1]","The first time I heard of &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;, I cringed in my seat. The very thought of Jim Carrey playing with the powers of God was enough to make me a little uneasy. There are very few movies of Carrey's that I would admit to liking, and I'd probably only admit to even remotely enjoying &quot;Liar Liar&quot; if you put a knife to my throat and refused to move it until I finally confessed. But not so with &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;. This is a film that, though goofy and a little rude on the surface, is really a thoughtful comedy about all the misconceptions people constantly have about God.Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a news anchor whose career is simply not going the way he'd like. His nemesis Evan(the always funny Steve Carrell) is stealing all the glory, he's constantly late for work and, to top it all off, his dog Sam seems physically unable to go to the bathroom inside the house. Bruce is so frustrated with his life that he decides to turn his back on God, saying that he himself could clear up the mess of his life within five minutes, and that God is neglecting his job. Enter...God! Hearing Bruce's claims that the Almighty is unfit for his job, God(Morgan Freeman) willingly hands the reigns to Bruce, wishing him good luck. After a series of self-indulgences that cause serious unforseen consequences, including the loss of his girlfriend Grace(Jennifer Aniston), the only person who has ever totally supported him, Bruce finally submits himself to God's will, and learns to accept that the world does not actually revolve around him.There are several clever innovations in the film. When Bruce discovers that he cannot possibly listen to all the prayer requests coming at once (in the form of terribly obnoxious voices in his head), he creates a database where he can read prayer requests in the form of e-mails. The name of the database: Yahweh. When Bruce lassoes down the moon for Grace, a huge freak tidal wave occurs in Japan as a result of &quot;strange lunar activity&quot;. I'd talk about more of these clever parts, but I wouldn't want to ruin the film.The DVD is loaded with neat special features, including exstensive outtakes and alternate/cut scenes, all of which are fun to watch, and a couple of which provide just a little more food-for-thought. There's even a short featurette showing alternate cut parts of Carrey's scenes.&quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; is sort of a diamond in the rough. Though it's advertised as a wacky, crazy comedy, and looks like your typical Carrey vehicle-lots of chances for the star to use his outrageous facial exspressions(and there's plenty of that too)-there's really quite a bit more under the surface than there seems at first, leaving us with a fun, enjoyable movie that leaves you laughing as well as thinking.",4,Much more than meets the eye,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,2791,"['first', 'time', 'heard', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'quot', 'cringed', 'seat', 'very', 'thought', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'powers', 'God', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'little', 'uneasy', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'Carrey', 'would', 'admit', 'liking', ""'d"", 'probably', 'only', 'admit', 'even', 'remotely', 'enjoying', 'quot', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'quot', 'put', 'knife', 'throat', 'refused', 'move', 'finally', 'confessed', 'not', 'so', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'quot', 'film', 'goofy', 'little', 'rude', 'surface', 'really', 'thoughtful', 'comedy', 'misconceptions', 'people', 'constantly', 'have', 'God.Carrey', 'plays', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'news', 'anchor', 'career', 'simply', 'not', 'going', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'nemesis', 'Evan', 'always', 'funny', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'stealing', 'glory', 'constantly', 'late', 'work', 'top', 'off', 'dog', 'Sam', 'physically', 'unable', 'go', 'bathroom', 'house', 'Bruce', 'so', 'frustrated', 'life', 'turn', 'back', 'God', 'saying', 'could', 'clear', 'up', 'mess', 'life', 'five', 'minutes', 'God', 'neglecting', 'job', 'Enter', 'God', 'Hearing', 'Bruce', 'claims', 'Almighty', 'unfit', 'job', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'willingly', 'reigns', 'Bruce', 'wishing', 'good', 'luck', 'series', 'self-indulgences', 'cause', 'serious', 'unforseen', 'consequences', 'including', 'loss', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'totally', 'supported', 'Bruce', 'finally', 'God', 'will', 'accept', 'world', 'not', 'actually', 'revolve', 'him.There', 'are', 'several', 'clever', 'innovations', 'film', 'When', 'Bruce', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'listen', 'prayer', 'coming', 'once', 'form', 'terribly', 'obnoxious', 'voices', 'head', 'database', 'where', 'can', 'read', 'prayer', 'requests', 'form', 'e-mails', 'name', 'database', 'Yahweh', 'When', 'Bruce', 'down', 'moon', 'Grace', 'huge', 'freak', 'tidal', 'wave', 'occurs', 'Japan', 'result', 'quot', 'strange', 'lunar', 'activity', 'quot', ""'d"", 'talk', 'more', 'clever', 'parts', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'neat', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'exstensive', 'outtakes', 'alternate/cut', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'couple', 'provide', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'food-for-thought', 'even', 'short', 'featurette', 'showing', 'alternate', 'cut', 'parts', 'Carrey', 'scenes.', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'quot', 'sort', 'diamond', 'rough', 'advertised', 'wacky', 'crazy', 'comedy', 'typical', 'Carrey', 'vehicle-lots', 'chances', 'star', 'use', 'outrageous', 'facial', 'exspressions', 'plenty', 'too', 'really', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'surface', 'there', 'first', 'leaving', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'laughing', 'as', 'well', 'thinking']",Bruce Almighty

763834,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B0000AKCKI,,"[1, 1]","Up until now many loyal Jim Carrey fans were half-expecting to see their favorite comedian on one of those ?Where are they now?? specials after not appearing a young adult comedy for nearly three years. The man who was once declared a king of comedy seems to have hit a bit of dry spot as of late in his career. Me, Myself & Irene, in which he starred opposite his then-girlfriend Ren?e Zellweger, was not quite the hit many had come to expect from the directors of There?s Something About Mary and though his dramatic performance in The Majestic was critically hailed, Oscar continued to allude Carrey?s dramas as did the movie-going public. Despite finding failure in several films, Carrey did manage to score a successful family hit with The Grinch in 2000. With time taken off to set things in order, Jim Carrey splashes onto the comedy scene in top form once again. This time around he takes on the role of a man who thinks he can do a better job at being God then the big man himself in Bruce Almighty, which will be followed by a new dramatic feature Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Now just as long as Adam Sandler doesn?t appear in any independent films from now until the 77th Annual Academy Awards then Carrey would have a pretty decent year.The story focuses on a man who, after having the worst day of his life, decides to challenge God and show him that he can be a better ruler of the universe then he is. Bruce Nolan seems to have everything going his way with a beautiful girlfriend, a decent apartment, and a steady job at the local news station and he would appear pretty easy going about it ? when life isn?t bringing him down that is. Bruce?s job is the ?joke? position of human interest reporter which cost him numerous promotions which end up going to the more ?qualified? news anchors who flaunt it in front of his face. And whenever he attempts to help someone, like a homeless man on a street near the news station, he ends up getting punished for it. With all these miserable events taking place within the course of just one day, Bruce reaches the breaking point and snaps by calling upon God himself. He claims that God isn?t doing his job properly and claims anyone could do a better job then he?s doing now. Upon hearing his blasphemous declaration, God gives Bruce the opportunity of a thousand life times: The chance to be God complete with all his powers to do with them what he pleased and prove he can do a better job then he can. There are only two rules: First, Bruce can't tell anybody he is God, and second, he can't affect a person's free will. Sound easy? That?s what Bruce thinks but it isn?t too long till he finds out that he may have bitten more then he can chew. The story for Bruce Almighty, as predictable as it may be, is still entertaining for the situations Bruce is placed in as well as the religious context that is used in an effective, if not unorthodox, way in the story line.There are only three main characters in the film and the actors that play them are pretty well-known, so one would think this would be a stellar cast, right? For the most part the answer would be yes but there are some performances that would in a ?no? answer instead. Jim Carrey thankfully returns to top form as the lead character in this comedy. And let?s not put Carrey?s dramatic disappointments down too much. It?s those roles in films like The Majestic and Man on the Moon that come into decent use when serious issues are dealt with, which they do in between the numerous comedic sequences. Just seeing Carrey being so funny and then changing almost unnoticeably into a serious state makes him one of the rare outstanding comedic actors out there. There couldn?t have been a more perfect choice for the role of God then Morgan Freeman with the performance he gave in this film. At first it wouldn?t seem like too good of an idea with most of Freeman?s acting experience coming from dramatic films such as Deep Impact and The Sum of All Fears but he doesn?t show much signs of being unacquainted with a different genre. And near perfect comedic timing he has opposite Jim Carrey makes you hope that with this film, he?ll be more willing to test the comedic waters in future films. The only problem based on the cast came from the performance of Jennifer Aniston. Giving her some benefit of the doubt, she does have that attractive look and brings some emotion to the role but mostly she doesn?t show any extraordinary acting talent. Here?s her basic performance: Either she is crying or showing no emotion what-so-ever. She doesn't present anything in the role that the audience hasn't seen before or different from her character on Friends. Perhaps she should just stick with roles like The Good Girl, which was a critical success for her, because her comedic acting is not anything to laugh at.Overall, Bruce Almighty answers the prayers of many and finally delivers an effective comedic approach to religious ideology without creating too much of a fifer with the zealot minority. Even with the statement, there are just too many small problems to give this film too much of an approval rating. As it was said earlier, the story is decent but it?s nothing spectacular as there several funny elements but there isn?t a steady consistency amongst the sequences of the film. There are several moments that fall flat leaving the audience waiting for the next hilarious moment to appear. While on the subject of humor, too many of Carrey?s jokes are dependant on farts and potty humor to get laughs, when he can get laughs just as easily from witty one-liners. Going back to the film?s story, when it comes to the more serious moments of the feature, it becomes way too sappy and tends to push away numerous audience members that came mostly for the comedy aspect rather then anything else. The first two-thirds of the film are great but the other one-third just turns the feature into another typical romantic-comedy complete with predictable, but happy, ending. Jim Carrey, with some help from Morgan Freeman, is the savior of this film which, had it been in the hands of someone else, could have fallen pretty flat on its face. Bruce Almighty may not be the Matrix Reloaded but it is a nice alternative for those too young or too old to enjoy the sci-fi flick.",4,The Moose Hole - Carrey is 'Mighty' Once Again,1072742400,"12

While this movie does deliver enough of these things to keep Carrey's fans interested, it also has a enough humor to keep the rest of us interested.Carrey stars as Bruce Nolan, a down on his luck TV reporter in Buffalo.  Bruce is assigned to all of the ""feel good"" stories like the people trying to bake the world's largest cookie and feels that the light stuff he reports on is ruining his career.  All Bruce wants is the head anchor job, so when his rival Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) gets the job, Bruce is quite angry.  Lacking a better target to address his anger towards, Bruce decides that god himself is responsible for his problems.  He goes into a tirade about how, ""god is the mean kid"" that is beating him up.Much to Bruce's surprise, god (Morgan Freeman!!) has heard his angry rants and contacts Bruce.  To shut Bruce up, god gives him full use of god's powers and appoints him celestial guardian of Buffalo.  At first, being a deity is all fun an games.

763837,AZI0O32W4ZYGH,B0000AKCKI,,"[1, 2]","ACTING:  As usual, Jim Carrey does an outstanding performance.  Of course, his acting is quite similar in everything that he does.  Jennifer Aniston, however, does terribly.  It's hard to take her role seriously at all.  Since I never watched &quot;Friends,&quot; I did not realize that she lacked any talent whatsoever.In any case, the story was very clever.  The notion that one wants to fire God because He is not living up to our expectations is a long standing concern.  Mere mortals think that we could do a better job.  In this story, though, God hands over his power to Bruce for him to use as he sees fit.  There are two rules: (a) respect free-will; (b) and don't let anyone know you're God.  The movie is quite clever in placing many highly religious symbols near Bruce.  During a party a Golden-cafe is quite noticeable; a man Bruce helps says &quot;God bless you&quot; to Bruce, even though, according to the story, Bruce is God.Bruce learns that when he is granted God's powers he has a hard time dealing with the enormous number of things that God must do.  Despite hearing many prayers, and hoping to respond to them, he has a hard time with this task.  It is a task-intensive job.With unlimited powers, many people would probably feel as though they would be happy and could accomplish anything they wanted to.  But with the burdens of responding to prayers and feeling invicible, Bruce still was not happy.  His relationship with his girlfriend was falling apart, and he could not use his powers to make her love him.  He had to do the right thing in order for that to happen.  To do so, ironically, he had to become a mere mortal once again, subject to the dangerous of everyday life.  And when one unfortunate incident does happen -- to be left unsaid for those who have not seen the movie -- his girlfriend falls in love with him again, perhaps, at first, out of sympathy.Michael",4,The Story Takes on a Novel Approach to God,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,1900,"['ACTING', 'usual', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'course', 'acting', 'quite', 'similar', 'everything', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'however', 'terribly', 'hard', 'take', 'role', 'seriously', 'never', 'watched', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'lacked', 'talent', 'whatsoever.In', 'case', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'notion', 'one', 'fire', 'God', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'expectations', 'long', 'standing', 'concern', 'Mere', 'mortals', 'think', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'story', 'God', 'power', 'Bruce', 'use', 'fit', 'are', 'two', 'rules', 'respect', 'free-will', 'b', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'know', ""'re"", 'God', 'movie', 'quite', 'clever', 'placing', 'many', 'highly', 'religious', 'symbols', 'Bruce', 'party', 'Golden-cafe', 'quite', 'noticeable', 'man', 'Bruce', 'quot', 'God', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'even', 'according', 'story', 'Bruce', 'God.Bruce', 'learns', 'when', 'granted', 'God', 'powers', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'enormous', 'number', 'things', 'God', 'must', 'do', 'hearing', 'many', 'prayers', 'hoping', 'respond', 'hard', 'time', 'task', 'task-intensive', 'job.With', 'unlimited', 'powers', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'could', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'wanted', 'burdens', 'responding', 'prayers', 'feeling', 'invicible', 'Bruce', 'still', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'falling', 'apart', 'could', 'not', 'use', 'powers', 'make', 'love', 'had', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'order', 'happen', 'do', 'so', 'ironically', 'had', 'become', 'mere', 'mortal', 'once', 'again', 'subject', 'dangerous', 'everyday', 'life', 'when', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'incident', 'happen', 'be', 'left', 'unsaid', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'girlfriend', 'love', 'again', 'perhaps', 'first', 'sympathy.Michael']",Bruce Almighty

Jim Carrey proves once again that he is a very gifted performer of physical comedy, and Morgan Freeman is imposing as the Man Upstairs.But the film suffers from a lack of imagination from its screenwriters.  There must be thousands of creative paths to take with a premise like this one, but the screenwriters barely scratch the surface of all the possibilities.  It felt like the first thoughts in the writers' heads went down onto the paper and then went onto the screen.Also, the movie aims only for belly laughs and doesn't try to be an intelligent or thought-provoking film, like 1977's ""Oh, God!""Even with all its weaknesses, I still enjoyed ""Bruce Almighty"" and laughed a lot.

763839,A32IWIJ6UI3YYF,B0000AKCKI,,"[1, 2]","""Bruce Almighty"" is a reasonably funny Jim Carrey film which gets limited use from it's star's athletic brand of humor.  Say it ain't so, Joe, but could Carrey be slowing down somewhat?  I remember back in the mid-80's when Robin Williams began to tackle less frenetic and more serious roles.  Was it that he was trying to be taken more seriously as an actor or just felt like he had worn out that familar vehicle?  It appears that Carrey may be on that same track.  He even looks much older and more mature in this film.  While ""Bruce Almighty"" is far from serious, it IS a definite departure from films like ""Dumb and Dumber"" and the ""Ace Ventura"" franchise.  Carrey shows flashes of his former physical brand of humor in ""Bruce.."", but even he would have to admit that he's more sedate in this movie.Carrey plays a sterotypical ""loser"" in the film who, when he doesn't get the ""big promotion"" at the television station in which he works, blames everybody but himself. Especially God. In scenes reminiscent of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Carrey takes stock of his life and his future and wallows in the dispair of his present.As he continues to express his displeasure with the Creator and blame his problems on Him, he finds a phone number on his pager that he feels compelled to return.  When the voice on the other end invites him to a meeting at an abandoned building, Carrey takes him up on it.  Of course, it is at the building that Carrey meets up with God (played by the wonderful Morgan Freeman).  God gives Carrey the opportunity to ""play God"" for a while to see how he likes it and to find out how tough a job it really is.From that point, the story takes some familar Jim Carrey comedy turns and fans of his particular brand of humor will find it quite funny.  The rest of the movie is spent with Carrey wishing that he didn't have the power of God and trying hard to give it back.  It's the typical ""grass isn't always greener on the other side"" motif that was present in movies such as the aforementioned ""...Wonderful Life"".Jennifer Anniston is quite good as the long-suffering girl friend of Carrey who tries to be supportive but finds herself drifting away from the new persona that Carrey has as Bruce Almighty.  Once again, a pretty standard ""boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy regains girl"" plotline is used by Director Tom Shadyac to help tie the movie together at the end.All in all, this certainly is not a movie that will gain Carrey his star of fame outside of Graumann's Chinese Theater, but I can't say that it's not an enjoyable movie either.  There are some great scenes with the dog and the tongue-tied anchorman scene is really funny and quite painful in a way!  It's got a lot of fluff, but Jim Carrey fans will more than likely get a kick out of it.Recommended for the fans of Jim Carrey and very, very light comedies.

763840,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000AKCKI,,"[1, 2]","Bruce Almighty is clearly inspired by one Frank Capra film you will see in this film itself.  I don't say 'steal' because Jim Carrey plays a uniquely hilarious and delightful loser-turned-winner of life (so he thinks), whose charm is so irresistible.  Just don't think too much about the film's predictable nature.Bruce Nolan is working at a local TV station in Buffalo, where he is a kind of celebrity because of his crazy style of 'reporting' the people and news.  And today, he is standing before the camera, telling the story of a boat at Niagara Falls.  Sad thing is, another guy is promoted to the position of anchor which Bruce coveted.Bruce is depressed, so depresed that he starts to blame God for what God did, or did not.  Suppose God really heard the words, and appeared in the shape of Morgan Freeman who proposes: &quot;How about doing my jobs?&quot;The premise is so Capra-like that you can see Jimmy Stewart in Bruce's character when this now alimighy guy 'pulls' the moon for his love Jennifer Aniston.  But the strength of &quot;Bruce Almighy&quot; lies in elsewhere; that's Jim Carrey's funny performance as Bruce.  This time, without the &quot;Mask,&quot; Bruce can do anything, which means you will be watching many silly ideas realize in the real world, which only Jim can do or think about.  Of course, this is nothing subtle or intelligent, but it is good to see him un-Grinch himself.It is obvious that Bruce is dealing with the power which is more than he can handle.  Like Capra (sorry again), the film has its darker side implied, but that is restriced to the minimum amount.  The ending is certainly sugar-coated, but it is better than the butterfly and spaghetti scenes of &quot;Patch Adams.&quot;  I am not particularly a fan of Tom Shadyac, but in my book this is one of his better films, possibly this side of &quot;Liar Liar.&quot;It is true that the film should have been made with more calculated skills; think about Bruce who lives with Jennifer Aniston in a pretty decent room.  Hey, who's gonnna complain with the life with lovely Aniston, I say?  Not Brad Pitt.  Not me.  There are many other things which the film should not have done, but still I like &quot;Bruce Alighty&quot; for what it is, a showcase of Jim Carrey's comic sense.

763845,A3FMZGLC0XBU64,B0000AKCKI,,"[1, 2]","In the gentle comedy ""Bruce Almighty"", Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a fluff-reporter who longs to become anchorman. When he is passed over for a promotion, Bruce curses God to his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), insisting that God's rule of the world is not satisfactory and that he could do a much better job of running the world himself. What he is not expecting, however, is for God (Morgan Freeman) to appear and give him this very responsibility and privilege.The film is predictable but successful in its portrayal of what the world would be like if a human being, and a disgruntled one at that, was given the task of ruling the world. Jim Carrey achieves most of his laughs through his slapstick humor and characteristic goofiness. Meanwhile, Jennifer Aniston adequately plays her part as the devoted, do-gooder girlfriend who stands beside Bruce in supporting his career ambitions even when he is too wrapped up in himself to realize she is yearning for him to propose. The deadpan, cool-as-a-cucumber demeanor of Morgan Freeman's God is well-matched with Bruce's playful humor.Perhaps the film suffers most when it oversteps its boundaries in terms of making a statement about morality. Rather than simply portraying Bruce as selfish and acknowledging that no person is fit for the task of ""playing God"", the film throws in a contrast between Bruce and Grace. According to Grace's best friend, every night before she goes to bed, Grace kneels down and prays.

God gives Bruce all his power to see if he can do a better job on two conditions that he doesn't tell anyone that he is God and that he can't interfere with free will.Bruce then uses his new found skills to create a perfect evening of passion with his long time girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), house trains the dog to use the toilet, parts traffic so that he can get through with his newly conjured up sports car. He then plots to become the new anchor man at his old TV Station by conjuring up disasters like a meteorite hitting Buffalo and being the first news reporter to arrive on the scene to get the exclusive.There is a hilarious scene when Bruce makes his collegue Evan speak gobbledegooks when he his broadcasting the news live. I couldn't stop laughing with tears streaming down my face.Bruce then realises that he has to answer the prayers of people and being lazy he just answers everybody's prayer by tapping yes. Thus resulting in thousands of people winning the lottery jackpot which then creates a riot in Buffalo.This was a very laugh out loud funny film. Jim Carey is perfect in the role of Bruce, making funny faces and quick witted comments. Jennifer Aniston is cute as Grace, the long term suffering girlfriend of Bruce.

763865,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B0000AKCKI,,"[2, 3]","Let me preface this review by saying that I  really wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately I got bogged down in Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey to enjoy the movie more. Now, I'm all for physical comedy but after several movies its starting to get old.One of the problems I had with this film is that Carrey's character Bruce Nolan is so unlikable for most of the movie it's to feel much sympathy for him at the end. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan who feels that his world is falling apart because God is not giving him what he feels that he deserves.  After being passed over at work Bruce curses God. Following an unusual series of pages Bruce goes to what he thinks is a job interview at Omni Presents where he meets the Almighty in the human form of Morgan Freeman. God informs Bruce that he is taking a short vacation leaving Bruce with all his powers.The middle third of the film shows how the somewhat selfish Bruce utilizes these powers.The other leads in the film are Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's fiance Grace and Philip Baker Hall as his boss. The talent is available in the movie but it is underused simply as a showcase for Carrey's comedy.Perhaps the strongest part of this DVD is the always good commentary by Tom Shadyac who explains the plot and spiritual elements that he was working towards. Included are a series of outtakes and deleted scenes. Neither of these features is anything to write home about but do provide an interesting few moments.A real downside to this disc and all of Universal's current offerings is the forced viewing of trailers before one ever accesses a menu. I don't want to see these trailers everytime I put the disc iun the player. Universal simply needs to find a better way to present thgis material.This is a light viewing experience which had the potential to be much greater than it actually was.",2,That's the way the Cookie Crumbles,1070409600,"12 3, 2003",2003,1836,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'got', 'bogged', 'down', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'being', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'Now', ""'m"", 'physical', 'comedy', 'several', 'movies', 'starting', 'get', 'old.One', 'problems', 'had', 'film', 'Carrey', 'character', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'so', 'unlikable', 'most', 'movie', 'feel', 'much', 'sympathy', 'end', 'Carrey', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'who', 'world', 'falling', 'apart', 'God', 'not', 'giving', 'what', 'being', 'passed', 'work', 'Bruce', 'God', 'Following', 'unusual', 'series', 'pages', 'Bruce', 'what', 'job', 'interview', 'Omni', 'Presents', 'where', 'Almighty', 'human', 'form', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'God', 'Bruce', 'taking', 'short', 'vacation', 'leaving', 'Bruce', 'powers.The', 'middle', 'third', 'film', 'how', 'somewhat', 'selfish', 'Bruce', 'other', 'leads', 'film', 'are', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Bruce', 'fiance', 'Grace', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'boss', 'talent', 'available', 'movie', 'underused', 'simply', 'showcase', 'Carrey', 'comedy.Perhaps', 'strongest', 'part', 'DVD', 'always', 'good', 'commentary', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'who', 'plot', 'spiritual', 'elements', 'was', 'working', 'towards', 'Included', 'are', 'series', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'features', 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'do', 'provide', 'interesting', 'few', 'moments.A', 'real', 'downside', 'disc', 'Universal', 'current', 'offerings', 'forced', 'viewing', 'trailers', 'one', 'ever', 'menu', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'trailers', 'everytime', 'put', 'disc', 'player', 'Universal', 'simply', 'find', 'better', 'way', 'present', 'thgis', 'material.This', 'light', 'viewing', 'experience', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'much', 'greater', 'actually', 'was']",Bruce Almighty

After all, God on the big screen has taken a few lumps over the years as the Big Man often gets watered down to an easy tempered, big hugs kind of deity. I was afraid it was going to be nothing more than the predictable ""play nice"" generics of ""Oh God!""I was wrong. Beyond what is the funniest movie I have seen in a few years, I believe ""Bruce Almighty"" is a worthy cinematic look at God as the much more serious classic, ""The Robe."" Biblical and poetic license are at play in the movie, but the core messages comes through: God knows best, we don't. Trust God. Be content.""Bruce Almighty"" is played excellently by the master of over-the-top performances, Jim Carrey. When given the chance to be God, Bruce jumps in headlong, feeling that with ultimate power comes ultimate ease. He discovers quickly that there is more to being God than being able to part the Red Sea. He learns that godly wisdom is not something trifely pulled out the hat of the leader of the universe. When Bruce tries to do the job of God, he shows his feeble human wisdom, creating an array of hilarious situations on Carrey could pull off.The plot blends sight gags, puns, situation comedy and various subplot interplays with Bruce and his fianc&eacute;e (played with mediocrity by Jennifer Aniston) trying to sort out their relationship, and of Bruce looking for satisfaction in his job.Morgan Freeman handles his role as the Lord subtlety and respectfully. It could have been easy to abuse the character, but both the writers and Freeman retain the dignity of God without making him staid and elusive.I fully recommend ""Bruce Almighty.""

Not only do you get a hilarious and laughable movie with the indespensable Jim Carrey, but you get a lot of neat extras along with it such as a commenary with the director, and tons of deleted scenes which are always cool.At first I really didn't expect much from this film. I thought about the controversy coming over it about trying to mock God, and I was a little suspicious about that too because I'm a christian, but there's no reason to doubt because even the common christian can get a good laugh out of this one. There are tons of biblical cliche's that even a person like Jim Carrey can change from serious, to hilarious.Bruce Nolan (the lovable Jim Carrey) is a completely misunderstood news caster. Always being put second in line, people with less talent are given the things he should get, even having a breakdown to this factor, and getting fired. But when he is paged to come downtown to a small building, he decides &quot;Hey, got nothin' else better to do&quot;. There, of all beings to meet, he meets the Creater, the Almighty One, the supreme being; God (Morgan Freeman, a great God by the way). After blowing off the fact that he has met the all powerful one, God endows him with all the powers to show him just how hard it is to be God. After much mayhem, many laughs, and confusion just to impress people, Bruce decides there's more to life than just living high and mighty all the time.A great movie for anyone to watch. It also has a good message to it which every good movie needs. Bruce Almighty should've been given a lot more credit than it has, but it gets enough of that from its fans. Jim Carrey rocks.

763869,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B0000AKCKI,,"[2, 4]","I confess I've disliked most comedies by Carrey in the past few years. After &quot;The Mask&quot;, &quot;Ace Ventura&quot; and &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; I felt he did a better job at more 'serious' roles, such as Truman (in &quot;Truman Show&quot;) and his outstanding work in &quot;Man in the Moon&quot;. But &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; brought me back into his list of followers.I loved his performance here. I wouldn't call it touching (have to disagree a bit there, with some of my colleague reviewers), but he's definitely back to being funny as in his best of times! And although he continues to do the faces (actually, one of the funniest moments in the movie is not actually his, but played by the reporter that beats him to the position of news anchor, when Bruce -with God's powers- makes him act wacky while on the air), his true genius comes in the subtle details, with the small jokes that come in and out of a scene without you barely noticing. This becomes more obvious if you peek behind the scenes in the Bonus Features, and see the tens of ideas he came up with for a particular shot (where he lights up the candles in the bedroom to set a romantic mood for himself and his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Aniston).As for Aniston, I'd like to see her take on different types of roles. Don't know if it's just me, but the last couple of movies I've seen of her (&quot;The Good Girl&quot; and this one) are starting to look a bit cliched, with her getting into the shoes of 'victimized' partner of someone else. Though her performance wasn't bad in &quot;Bruce...&quot; I know she can do a lot better than that, so please do it, Jen!All in all, I am happy to see that Carrey is still strong as a comedian and a great performer, as he's proved once and again in both funny and more serious movies.

Would you persevere?  Just plain give up on trying?  Or would you lash out at God, after all when it seems the entire universe is against you, only one being could even possibly help you out of that kind of trouble.  If you chose the option of lashing out at God, which under some circumstances isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it's done in proper context and with respect for God.  By lashing out at God do you think that would solve your problems?  Do you think that God would snap his fingers and make your problems simply disappear or that maybe God would sort of take a vacation and give you His powers for a while to see if you could do His job better?  If you thought the answer about God giving you His powers was correct, then clearly you haven't been reading your Bible all that closely, but you have probably been watching or at least heard of the movie starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, ""Bruce Almighty"".""Bruce Almighty"" is the story of a down-trodden news reporter, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), who believes that the entire world, nay the universe, is against him in all that he does.  Bruce's girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), tries to assure him that one of these days things will begin to turn around for him, but Bruce doesn't believe this to be true.  So after lashing out at God in anger, accusing Him of not doing His job properly, Bruce is given a life-changing opportunity.  A personal visit with God (Morgan Freeman), leaves Bruce endowed with all of God's powers, and God challenges Bruce to see if he can do a better job than the Almighty God can.Truly one of Jim Carrey's most hilarious performances since ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"", this over-the-top, laugh until you hurt comedy will leave you wanting to go back to watch it time and time again.  ""Bruce Almighty"" may come off as blasphemous to some, though I'm a Christian and I found it to not be blasphemous, but that's my opinion and not everyone agrees with me.  Though this movie is truly hilarious, there are some deep issues regarding faith, and man's relationship with God that get explored here.  Even though I don't believe this movie was written by a devout Christian, it still manages to deal with issues of free will, the corruption of absolute power, surrendering to God's will, and God's love for mankind, in very real and engaging ways that can be taken to heart by any Christian.  I truly believe that Christians should watch this movie, but bear in mind that there are moments that may be offensive to some, and times that tread on borderline blasphemous, but in the end this film steers clear of that territory, and comes out on top.I did say that I feel that Christians should watch this movie, but actually anyone who is looking for a movie that will have them laughing constantly should watch ""Bruce Almighty"".

763877,A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ,B0000AKCKI,,"[5, 10]","This film certainly presented an intriguing concept:  what would an ordinary man do with divine powers?  While this was a clever idea, it is not executed very well in this film that becomes a typical Jim Carrey comedy.Let's review, shall we?  Every Jim Carrey slapstick fare must have a few vital elements:  1.  Lots of spazzing out and mugging.  2.  A catchphrase (in this case: B-E-autiful).  3. A girl who puts up with his antics (Jennifer Aniston as Grace).  4.  A heartwarming scene at the end as his character learns his lesson.Carrey is funny as Bruce Nolan, a disgruntled news reporter who's mad at God for the many problems in his life.  But his character is somewhat shallow, using his borrowed divine powers to blow women's skirts up and to part traffic like the Red Sea.  He does wise up in the end, but his transformation seems a bit unbelievable.  In a sense, Bruce echoes Carrey's character in ""Liar Liar,"" an unlikable person on the whole until his final moment of clarity.Morgan Freeman is funny as the almighty one, but he's great in most films anyway.  Aniston manages to be a sympathetic character, but with her own funny moments as well.  But Carrey does steal most of the movie from anyone else's clutches, and that isn't always a good thing.I should probably warn parents now that there are many raunchy jokes and a very loud proclamation of the F-word in this film.  So if your seven-year-old loves Jim Carrey, you might want to use caution with this one.Bottom line:  I did laugh during this movie, but many jokes were not very original or clever.  The performances are good from the supporting cast, but Carrey is over-the-top as usual.  The message of the movie is honorable, but it gets buried and lost amidst the jokes.  All in all, I think it might have been a better quality film if they had focused more on the theme instead of on gags.",3,"Amusing, but typical",1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,1868,"['film', 'certainly', 'presented', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'what', 'would', 'ordinary', 'man', 'do', 'divine', 'powers', 'was', 'clever', 'idea', 'not', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'typical', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'comedy.Let', 'review', 'shall', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'slapstick', 'fare', 'must', 'have', 'few', 'vital', 'elements', '1', 'Lots', 'spazzing', 'out', 'mugging', '2', 'catchphrase', 'case', 'B-E-autiful', '3', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'antics', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Grace', '4', 'heartwarming', 'scene', 'end', 'character', 'lesson.Carrey', 'funny', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'disgruntled', 'news', 'reporter', 'who', 'mad', 'God', 'many', 'problems', 'life', 'character', 'somewhat', 'shallow', 'using', 'borrowed', 'divine', 'powers', 'blow', 'women', 'skirts', 'up', 'part', 'traffic', 'Red', 'Sea', 'wise', 'up', 'end', 'transformation', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'sense', 'Bruce', 'Carrey', 'character', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'unlikable', 'person', 'whole', 'final', 'moment', 'clarity.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'funny', 'almighty', 'one', 'great', 'most', 'films', 'anyway', 'Aniston', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'own', 'funny', 'moments', 'well', 'Carrey', 'steal', 'most', 'movie', 'anyone', 'else', 'clutches', ""n't"", 'always', 'good', 'thing.I', 'should', 'probably', 'warn', 'parents', 'now', 'are', 'many', 'raunchy', 'jokes', 'very', 'loud', 'proclamation', 'F-word', 'film', 'So', 'seven-year-old', 'loves', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'might', 'want', 'use', 'caution', 'one.Bottom', 'line', 'did', 'laugh', 'movie', 'many', 'jokes', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'clever', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Carrey', 'over-the-top', 'usual', 'message', 'movie', 'honorable', 'buried', 'lost', 'amidst', 'jokes', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'quality', 'film', 'had', 'focused', 'more', 'theme', 'instead', 'gags']",Bruce Almighty

That's what makes it worth watching.If you want theology in a movie, well, I'm not sure where you go to get that.  Holy Writ, not Hollywood screenwriters (would that be 'Holly writ'?), would be my guess.  Obviously, a movie with Jim Carrey is not making an attempt at being theologically correct.  It's a movie.  A Hollywoood movie, at that.  I think we expect too much out of Hollywood.  It's Hollywood, for God's sake.  It has its limitations, especially when success is measured in mass appeal.  Obviously, if the masses enjoy something, it can't be too deep.That being said, it's a fun movie, especially if we view it not as a theological treatise but as a movie that does have a positive spin to it.  It's good for some laughs.  I too expected this to be a hideous film but I was pleasantly surprised.It deals generically with topics such as God's will and power, prayer, as with selfishness and selflessness and a more 'philosophical' approach to some of life's quirks.

He makes the monumental decision to express his thought.

This time instead of, ""Death takes a Holiday"" (1934), God takes his. Now that Bruce has a chance to be in charge. What changes will we see? Was Bruce's assessment of the situation correct or a tad jaded from the situation?Of course this is a formula movie with the outcome determined before we start.

763886,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B0000AKCKI,Caleb Williams,"[1, 1]","I remember when I first watched Bruce Almighty about 3 years ago and I absolutely hated it. The way people raved on about how funny it was just didn't fly with me at all, I labelled it one of Carreys worst films and vowed never to watch it again. Fast forward 3 years and I'm in a New York hotel room, forced to stay in thanks to the blistering cold, and what's on TV? Why Bruce Almighty, thanks for asking. I decide to cancel that vow and just watch it again for good measure to cement my previous hatred. I was wrong, there I said it, I... Was... Wrong. It's difficult to say yes, but upon seeing this for the second time, for some unknown reason I absolutely loved it and have wondered since why I hated it so.Jim Carrey plays Bruce, a small time news reporter known and loved for his comedic and light hearted persona which is ironically holding him back in his career. Nothing ever seems to go right for Bruce and he's constantly complaining that God has forgotten about him and is dealing him the wrong hand. After a day in which his arch rival Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) steals Bruce's desired job as news anchor, he goes nuts and gets himself fired from the station. That night Bruce argues with his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) and leave the apartment leading to a crash. Upon getting out the car he gets a page with an address on it. The next day he visits the address and is confronted by a Janitor in the guise of Morgan Freeman. This janitor claims he is god and is going to take a break leaving Bruce in charge to see if he can do a better job. Over the course of the film, Bruce uses his newly obtained powers to get back at those who wronged him and fixes his life. He soon forgets, however, that he's now god so he must take care of everybodies wishes.This film isn't the funniest in the world and seems to at times quite a religiously propagandist film. Although it doesn't point towards one particular religion, it's obviously a film promoting the existence of god and blind faith. It is that of a very emotional film more than anything and talks about love and loyalty to the one you love. It also puts out there the idea of creating your own destiny and not waiting for something to be given to you. Some of the scenes are quite ridiculous and you would have thought that a man with godly powers would have done more than give himself a flash car. Although the comedy isn't really that immediately in your face, when it does appear it certainly succeeds in giving you a wealthy chuckle. One scene in particular is when Bruce is back in his job and is behind the scenes during one of Evans news casts. Bruce uses his godly powers and has Evan mess up his entire delivery costing the man his job. The acting by Carell in this scene is hysterical and had me in tears of laughter, the awkward look on the face mixed with the silliness of his news delivery is perfect.Jennifer Aniston also gives us an excellent performance and backs up my belief that the woman is a highly underrated actress long overdue of that one big movie. I'm sure it will come eventually, but for now we're just going to have to get the treat of her in the rare great roles. Jim Carrey and Steve Carell also play such great roles, with Jim obviously delivering some great acting once again. Morgan Freeman, I think it has to be said that it was a worthy choice for the role of God as Freeman becomes the first African American actor to play both the President of the USA and God himself. The actors and story blend together perfectly with it seeming that the roles were specifically written for the particular actors in mind.An awesome film that even if you didn't enjoy it the first time, you certainly will the second time around.",5,"God Is Black?

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[4, 5]","IN A NUTSHELL: CARREY WOULD HAVE TO BE GOD TO MAKE SOME OF THESE PRANKS BELIEVABLE!There are parts of this film, particularly in the beginning and then immediately after Bruce becomes Almighty, that are funny and fun beyond belief. But then, as we look around we see a lack of growth by the character [Bruce - Jim Carrey] at a point in the film where we'd expect him to 'get it' and have some kind of epiphany. The epiphany, when it does comes, comes in the form of devotion to the overlooked woman who has been praying for him all along, but it feels like it is too little too late.Narcissism seems to dominate 'Bruce Almighty' and it comes without enough balance thus making Bruce appear to be what he really would be like if he were god; a vain, selfish, lazy, hateful and vengeful god. Hardly the improvement the Bruce seemed to be promising when it all began!WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: MEDIOCRE IS A STATE OF MINDEssentially, Bruce Nolan [Jim Carrey] is dissatisfied with his life and feels it lacks meaning. ""Mediocre"" is the way Bruce described it. After complaining to god about everything he could think of that pertains to him and him alone, he gets to meet god and is endowed with god's powers so that he [Bruce] can set things right in his own way, presumably a better way.The problem is that Bruce has the same character flaws that he had before he was god and thus uses his power for his own self-indulgences which are rather mean spirited and narcissistic. He creates his own news, gets even with bullies, turns on his girl friend, Grace, [Jennifer Aniston] and literally pulls the full moon closer for its romantic effect.BUT . . . . . . . the effects that all of his actions have on others is almost universally harmful. Creating news by having a meteor strike near him while the camera was running did no one but Bruce any good. Even his lazy way of answering prayers but simply typing YES on his computer to all 3+ million of them had harmful effects. This is the point of the film where Bruce should have been starting to smarten up, but instead Bruce just indulged himself until he found that these shallow, petty self-indulgences were NOT improving his life or at least the way it felt to him. Still, Bruce never really demonstrated a change of attitudes while endowed with god's powers and never showed any real charity or caring toward others until Grace left him [except in deleted scenes].MY TAKE ON 'BRUCE ALMIGHTY'Well all of this would certainly be acceptible except that Jim Carrey seems to be asking us to take this film and its content completely seriously. 'Bruce Almighty' is at times very funny. My personal favorite scene, is Scene 11 on the DVD where Evan Baxter, [Steve Carell] spends two full minutes as a televised news anchor saying whatever Bruce felt like having the man that stole his job opportunity say and do, in order to demean and discredit him. This scene basically sums up the film, parts of it are hilarious but we are left in the second half looking for meaning that never really comes because Bruce's only real epiphany comes in the form of the loss of Grace, [Jennifer Aniston] who had cared for him rather unselfishly all along.ABOUT GOD: MORGAN FREEMAN SHOWS RATHER THAN TELLS & DOES IT LIKE A GODMorgan Freeman as god was terrific and wonderfully understated. He seemed to portray the idea that less is more where god's intervention is concerned. He also displayed infinite patience with Bruce and managed to keep a kind of mystical persona in all of his appearances, but especially in his last, where we were introduced with the notion that all or part of this was a kind of dream or perhaps not. Freeman's powerful presence coupled with Carrey's frenetic energy made for the most intense scenes in the film.-----> THE PRINCIPAL CAST [DIRECTED BY: TOM SHADYAC]Jim Carrey  - Bruce NolanJennifer Aniston  - GraceMorgan Freeman  - GodPhilip Baker Hall  - Jack KellerCatherine Bell  - Susan OrtegaLisa Ann Walter  - DebbieSteve Carell  - Evan BaxterNora Dunn  - Ally LomanSally Kirkland  - Anita MannTony Bennett  - Himself-----> AWARDSBest Supporting Actor (win) Morgan Freeman  2004 NAACP Image AwardsDVD SPECIAL FEATURES:OUT-TAKES, DELETED SCENES, & 'THE PROCESS OF JIM' FEATURETTE*---> 'THE DELETED SCENES', I felt some of the deleted scenes should have been included in the film because they gave the impression that Bruce had more of an epiphany and was growing as a human being into someone we could have more empathy with. We did see Bruce doing thoughtful things for others in some of these scenes and I can't help wondering why they were cut -- except for the running time of the film!*---> 'THE OUT-TAKES', nice to see once, but they are something we have grown rather familiar with around Jim Carrey. Nothing new here, but there are some funny things to see and will be especially appreciated by Carrey's fans.*---> ''THE PROCESS OF JIM' FEATURETTE, interesting though short, Jim Carrey is obviously having some fun here.BOTTOM LINE: A PROMISING CARREY VEHICLE WITH SOME 'REEL' HOOTS'Bruce Almighty' is a must see for Jim Carrey fans, though not his best work. Carrey again tries to be taken at face value, as in 'The Truman Show', but that is a rather hard sell with the director of 'Liar Liar', and 'Ace Ventura Pet Detective' sterring the project. Still, the film has a wonderful theme, Carrey is always full of explosively energetic fun and he's got Morgan Freeman as god and Jennifer Aniston as Grace, to pray for him.",4,VERY HIGH-MINDED THEME

763892,A1B6QFRKM2EX25,B0000AKCKI,Ivonna,"[17, 21]","I thought everything was handled with incredible comedic timing.  The first half of the movie the audience was laughing about every 20 seconds.  Jim Carrey did a fantastic job and played his role differently (but still very funny) than in movies such as The Mask, Ace Venturas, Liar Liar, Me Myself and Irene, Dumb and Dumber, Truman Show, and Batman.  His facial expressions were perfect.  Jennifer Aniston was great, and so was Morgan Freeman.  There were a few more serious moments partway through the film, but with quick ""recoveries"".  And yet, I believe, the serious moments were written extremely well.So on to who wouldn't like this film and who would, based on approaches to faith in God.  If you do believe in a God, and try to conform to what you believe that God wants from you, you may or may not like this movie.  It shows God in a way I know I hope God would be - very compassionate and good-humored, but some might be upset by the portrayal of limited power (not just free will, but being overwhelmed by prayers).  Some might not like that God would give his powers to someone who used those powers at times to beat up bad guys and glance up skirts once (could have been worse, though - absolute power is supposed to corrupt absolutely and Bruce was selfish but somewhat reasonable).  If you don't believe in a God, I think the humor of the film and the magical ""what if"" will be most enjoyable.  If you subconsciously or consciously do believe in a God but are not doing what you think that God requires, part of this film may be unpleasant for you.I'm glad Jennifer Aniston and Jim Carrey didn't get very physical.  They were believable as a couple, but not too physical.  I thought the movie was sweetly romantic even without physical involvement.  Better that way.  I'd like to see Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston stay happily married, so kudos to everybody who came up with the physical limit.  Jennifer was wonderful and very pretty too!This is funnier than Liar Liar and Patch Adams, which were also directed by the same director.  Everybody was perfectly cast.

763893,A3TKGM2JJJC1I3,B0000AKCKI,"Jennifer B. Barton ""Beth Barton""","[2, 2]","Morgan Freeman is a fantastic choice of actors for the role of God.  While George Burns (Oh God) was excellent for the loving God with a sense of humor,  he really didn't have a frightening side.  I could never picture him as the God of the Old Testament.  Morgan Freeman plays a very patient and understanding God with a subtle sense of humor but his previous roles in films like Insomnia make it pretty easy to picture him as the vengeful God of the old testament too.  Bravo, Bravo!Bruce Nolan (Jim Carey) is a ""fluff"" news reporter for Channel 7 in Buffalo but wants to be promoted to news anchor.  He is up against stiff competition from Evan Baxter (Steve Carroll).  When Evan gets the promotion and uses some of Nolan's material, Bruce loses his temper on a live feed and things go down hill from there.  After an exasperating day, he blames God for all his misfortunes and asserts that he could fix everyone's problems in 5 minutes.God takes him up on his bet and Bruce is given all of God's powers with two caveats - he can tell no one and he cannot affect free will.  The comedic things he does with these powers are pretty funny and is the focus of the film.  Most of them have to do with his personal life. However, he does come to appreciate the responsibilities of God and there is one great line - ""How do you make someone love you without affecting free will?"" to which Freeman's answer is ""If you find that out, let me know"".If Oh God was a religious comedy focusing on religion, Bruce Almighty is a religious comedy focusing on comedy.

763894,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0000AKCKI,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","`Bruce Almighty' was Jim Carrey's triumphant return to comedy after scratching the dramatic itch. After delivering such great performances in `The Truman Show' and `Man in the Moon', a return to the rubber-faced, flopping around Jim Carrey feels somewhat dated. Yes, Carrey's antics were getting stale at that time. But, fortunately, `Bruce' is a movie that matures along with him. In this sense it is actually a welcome sight when the movie puts its silly physical comedy in the backseat for the more dramatic exploration of the story's possibilities in the 3rd act.Carrey is showing his stuff here because this story and character is strong enough to have stood in the shoes of another. Shadyac did well to cast the great Morgan Freeman as Alpha and Omega. Freeman brings an elegant all knowing air and a humanistic touch together for an intriguing interpretation of God. Far better and more memorable than just a bright light or all-business interpretation. Jennifer Aniston, as usual, remains the weakest element in the movie as Bruce's live-in girlfriend and proverbial Holy Spirit in this symbolic trinity. `Daily Show' alumni Steve Carrell gets a chance to show off on the big screen although his big trailer moment isn't as funny as the director seems to think.More than its individual moments, `Bruce' is admirable for the creativity and, to be honest, simple audacity of its story. The movie has a clear vision and the script is sharp, intelligent and witty - a rarity in slacker comedies. The movie isn't too enamored with its own cleverness, applying its touches in blotches all over the movie and sometimes in unexpected ways. A subject that, no matter how fanciful it is dealt with by movies, manages to send both traditionalists and atheists into a rage with demands that the movie's view fit into their own. Like `Dogma' and `The Devil's Advocate' it's refreshing to see that this kind of movie can still get made.This movie might not quite top the previous high such as the adult fairy tale `Liar, Liar,' but ""Bruce Almighty"" is an interesting and entertaining comedy that brings religion as one of its major themes.",4,"A relationship with the Creator, love, compassion, and selflessness.",1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,2133,"['Bruce', 'Almighty', 'was', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'triumphant', 'return', 'comedy', 'scratching', 'dramatic', 'itch', 'delivering', 'such', 'great', 'performances', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Man', 'Moon', 'return', 'rubber-faced', 'flopping', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'Yes', 'Carrey', 'antics', 'were', 'getting', 'stale', 'time', 'fortunately', 'Bruce', 'movie', 'sense', 'actually', 'welcome', 'sight', 'when', 'movie', 'silly', 'physical', 'comedy', 'backseat', 'more', 'dramatic', 'exploration', 'story', 'possibilities', '3rd', 'act.Carrey', 'showing', 'stuff', 'here', 'story', 'character', 'strong', 'enough', 'have', 'stood', 'shoes', 'Shadyac', 'did', 'well', 'cast', 'great', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Alpha', 'Omega', 'Freeman', 'elegant', 'knowing', 'air', 'humanistic', 'touch', 'together', 'intriguing', 'interpretation', 'God', 'Far', 'better', 'more', 'memorable', 'just', 'bright', 'light', 'all-business', 'interpretation', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'usual', 'weakest', 'element', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'proverbial', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'symbolic', 'trinity', 'Daily', 'Show', 'alumni', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'chance', 'show', 'off', 'big', 'screen', 'big', 'trailer', 'moment', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'director', 'think.More', 'individual', 'moments', 'Bruce', 'admirable', 'creativity', 'be', 'honest', 'simple', 'audacity', 'story', 'movie', 'clear', 'vision', 'script', 'sharp', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'rarity', 'slacker', 'comedies', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'enamored', 'own', 'cleverness', 'applying', 'touches', 'blotches', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'subject', 'matter', 'how', 'fanciful', 'dealt', 'movies', 'send', 'traditionalists', 'atheists', 'rage', 'demands', 'movie', 'view', 'fit', 'own', 'Dogma', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'refreshing', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'made.This', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'quite', 'top', 'previous', 'high', 'such', 'adult', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'religion', 'one', 'major', 'themes']",Bruce Almighty
763895,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0000AKCKI,Joe Sherry,"[60, 68]","This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time.  Bruce Almighty starts Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, and Morgan Freeman.  The basic premise is this is a comedy about one man who is given the powers (and responsibilities) of God and we get to see what he does with this power.  Knowing that the movie stars Jim Carrey we expect quite a bit of over the top humor.  While we do have a fair amount of the typical Carrey humor, Bruce Almighty is a lot more than that.Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a reporter for a local television station.  He gets the assignments that show off his warm and humorous side.  But Bruce wants the anchor position that will be opening up when the current male anchor retires.  Bruce does not feel that he is getting the respect or the opportunities necessary for him to be able to get the job he has always wanted.Bruce is living with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), an elementary school teacher.  When Bruce loses his job (have a nice Jim Carrey fit) he blames everyone and everything including God for his mediocre life.  Grace sees that Bruce is also calling their relationship mediocre and is now upset with Bruce.  Bruce blames God some more, asks for a sign (he gets several, which he promptly ignores) until finally he realizes that there is something going on and actually meets God (Morgan Freeman).  God is tired of listening to Bruce whine so much so he tells Bruce that if he thinks he can do a better job at running the world, then perhaps Bruce should try.  God endows Bruce with the divine power and lets Bruce have a go at it.Bruce does what most of us would do with the power of God.  He plays around with it for his own convenience, messes with the people who he doesn't like and uses it to help out his sex life with his girlfriend.  His use of power is very funny, but it appears that he is not happy with life.  Finally, Grace leaves him because even though Bruce is improving his life he has not changed who he is or how he acts to other people.The movie changes gears and turns into a film about Bruce's redemption with God and with Grace.  The film presents a positive message about God and faith that does not feel heavy handed at all (the director happens to be Christian).  I thought this was a fairly well thought out and incredibly funny movie.  It is the funniest movie thus far this year and I would definitely recommend it.",5,the funniest movie of the year,1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,2407,"['one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'basic', 'premise', 'comedy', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'powers', 'responsibilities', 'God', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'power', 'Knowing', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'expect', 'quite', 'bit', 'top', 'humor', 'do', 'have', 'fair', 'amount', 'typical', 'Carrey', 'humor', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'lot', 'more', 'that.Bruce', 'Nolan', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'reporter', 'local', 'television', 'station', 'assignments', 'show', 'warm', 'humorous', 'side', 'Bruce', 'anchor', 'position', 'will', 'be', 'opening', 'up', 'when', 'current', 'male', 'anchor', 'retires', 'Bruce', 'not', 'feel', 'getting', 'respect', 'opportunities', 'necessary', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'job', 'always', 'wanted.Bruce', 'living', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Connelly', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'When', 'Bruce', 'job', 'have', 'nice', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fit', 'everyone', 'everything', 'including', 'God', 'mediocre', 'life', 'Grace', 'Bruce', 'also', 'calling', 'relationship', 'mediocre', 'now', 'upset', 'Bruce', 'Bruce', 'God', 'more', 'sign', 'several', 'promptly', 'finally', 'something', 'going', 'actually', 'meets', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'God', 'tired', 'listening', 'Bruce', 'whine', 'so', 'much', 'Bruce', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'running', 'world', 'then', 'perhaps', 'Bruce', 'should', 'try', 'God', 'Bruce', 'divine', 'power', 'lets', 'Bruce', 'have', 'go', 'it.Bruce', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'do', 'power', 'God', 'own', 'convenience', 'people', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'help', 'out', 'sex', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'use', 'power', 'very', 'funny', 'not', 'happy', 'life', 'Finally', 'Grace', 'even', 'Bruce', 'improving', 'life', 'not', 'changed', 'who', 'how', 'other', 'people.The', 'movie', 'changes', 'gears', 'film', 'Bruce', 'redemption', 'God', 'Grace', 'film', 'positive', 'message', 'God', 'faith', 'not', 'feel', 'heavy', 'handed', 'director', 'be', 'Christian', 'thought', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'movie', 'funniest', 'movie', 'thus', 'far', 'year', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']",Bruce Almighty

When things don't go as he wished, he falls into a theological temper tantrum and calls God out for the injustice he perceives to have been done. God answers the call and teaches the self absorbed idiot a lesson by granting him divine power over a limited area of New York.At first this seems like a lot of fun but it soon becomes apparent that as he gets what he wants, he loses that which he most needs...the love of his long suffering girlfriend.I would never call this a teaching tool but it does have a point and that point is amusingly put.

Some of the comedy is a little tired and lacking, but there are truly some brilliant moments in the film.

Also, nobody in Hollywood could have pulled off playing the main character other than Jim Carrey.This movie had me roaring time and time again.  The only problem I had with it was Carrey was a little bit Ace Ventura from time to time. What I mean by that, is he was a little too unrealistic in some of his characters exaggerations.  Most of them were really funny, but it was a little much.  I don't mean to pick this movie apart because it was great.

When he has one of those days when nothing seems to go right and, to top it all off, loses out on a promotion to anchor, he curses God for his misfortune. God apparently took notice. To teach Bruce a lesson, God (Morgan Freeman) endows Bruce with all of his power on two conditions: Bruce can't tell anyone that he has God's powers, and he can't interfere with free will. Now Bruce will see just what God's  responsibilities really are while he tries to use his powers to improve his own life.&quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; is a comedy, a romance, and a morality play. Unfortunately, it often seems like it doesn't know which one to be. The romance and morality play angles work out all right. The comedy angle doesn't. Most of the film's comedy is derived from Bruce exercising his newfound powers. But these are the movie's least successful scenes. Bruce being God is just boring. Bruce's relationships with God, his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), and his co-workers are interesting. But most of Bruce's supernatural antics are dreadful. Jennifer Aniston does a nice job as Bruce's patient and put-upon girlfriend. Comic actor Steve Carell gives a real stand-out performance as Bruce's arrogant professional rival, Evan Baxter. Jim Carrey is, well, Jim Carrey. His physical comedy is impressive. His large gestures seem out of place in a tv newsroom, but perhaps they are supposed to. The movie falls down in being a comedy that just isn't very funny, although its less comic aspects fare better. Recommended as a rental.The DVD: Jim Carrey fans will appreciate the bonus features on the DVD more than anyone else. In &quot;The Process of Jim&quot;, director Tom Shadyac, who has worked with Carrey on 3 films, comments on Jim Carrey's improvisational techniques. There are several examples of scenes that were shot many times in which Carrey does something different each time. Other bonus features include: outtakes, deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), fairly comprehensive bios of cast, director, and producers, and a decent director's commentary. If you are a big Jim Carrey fan, check out the outtakes and deleted scenes as well as &quot;The Process of Jim&quot;. If you're not a big Carrey fan, there is nothing very exciting here.

""Bruce Almighty"" attempts to answer that question, with Jim Carrey playing Bruce Nolan, the whining, complaining ordinary Joe.  And Carrey has a field day with the character, delivering some of his funniest stuff yet, which include a tyrade on a newscast from Niagra Falls and making his rival newsman speak in gibberish.  Jennifer Aniston does well in her first mainstream role as Nolan's girlfriend Grace, and Morgan Freeman never takes his God role too seriously, which adds an extra layer of humor to a movie already chock full of Carrey's physical gags.Nolan (Carrey) is a reporter at a Bufallo news station, buts what he really wants to be is an anchorman.  But when his rival takes the job instead, and he loses his job because of his tyrade at Niagra Falls, he gets fired and starts to get on God's (Freeman) nerves because of his complaining.  All the while, he is starting to neglect his girlfriend Grace (Anniston).  But God hears Bruce's complaints and bestows his powers on him.  Carrey thinks all his problems are now solved as he now becomes known as Mr. Exclusive because he makes it so he covers amazing, freak stories, like a metorite hitting Earth.  Although, Bruce soon finds out that his new found fame is taking him away from what he really enjoys, i.e. grace, and he is going to lose all that if he does not change himself and how he acts.And that is the film's moral: instead of asking for everything, you have to get off your butt and do it yourself, and think about people other than yourself.  Despite the occasional corny moment, director Tom Shadyac (Who collaborated with Carrey on ""Liar, Liar"") still manages to lend enough gravity and emotion to the message, and makes a wholly satisfying conclusion to a movie that will make your sides split, as well as make you rethink the way you go about life.",4,"""And I Shall be Pleased""",1054684800,"06 4, 2003",2003,1907,"['What', 'when', 'God', 'whining', 'complaining', 'ordinary', 'Joe', 'powers', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'attempts', 'answer', 'question', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'whining', 'complaining', 'ordinary', 'Joe', 'Carrey', 'field', 'day', 'character', 'delivering', 'funniest', 'stuff', 'yet', 'include', 'tyrade', 'newscast', 'Niagra', 'Falls', 'making', 'rival', 'newsman', 'speak', 'gibberish', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'well', 'first', 'mainstream', 'role', 'Nolan', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'never', 'God', 'role', 'too', 'seriously', 'extra', 'layer', 'humor', 'movie', 'already', 'full', 'Carrey', 'physical', 'gags.Nolan', 'Carrey', 'reporter', 'Bufallo', 'news', 'station', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'anchorman', 'when', 'rival', 'job', 'instead', 'job', 'tyrade', 'Niagra', 'Falls', 'fired', 'get', 'God', 'Freeman', 'complaining', 'while', 'starting', 'neglect', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Anniston', 'God', 'Bruce', 'complaints', 'powers', 'Carrey', 'problems', 'are', 'now', 'solved', 'now', 'known', 'Mr', 'Exclusive', 'amazing', 'freak', 'stories', 'metorite', 'hitting', 'Earth', 'Bruce', 'soon', 'out', 'new', 'found', 'fame', 'taking', 'away', 'what', 'really', 'i.e', 'grace', 'going', 'lose', 'not', 'change', 'how', 'film', 'moral', 'instead', 'asking', 'everything', 'have', 'get', 'off', 'butt', 'do', 'think', 'people', 'other', 'occasional', 'corny', 'moment', 'director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'Who', 'collaborated', 'Carrey', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'still', 'lend', 'enough', 'gravity', 'emotion', 'message', 'wholly', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'sides', 'split', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'rethink', 'way', 'go', 'life']",Bruce Almighty

Of course, there were the knee jerk reactions by some evangelical pastors who may of condemned the movie without even watching it, but who could blame them?  Jim Carey, although a immensely talented actor (i.e., The Truman Show) have been in some pretty raunchy movies; but the more I heard about this movie, the more it appealed to me.  So, down to the video store we went.It is probably too much to ask that any Hollywood producer take a evangelical view when making a movie, but despite some weaknesses (the sin issue is not dealt with at all- maybe Carey's character Bruce Nolans life is falling apart because of the sin in his life) this movie is a serious attempt to deal with the nature of prayer.Of course, there are the pranks and the silliness one would expect from a Carey movie, but this movie does provoke one to thought.  What exactly is the relationship between free will and a God who loves us?

It's like trying to explain a joke if someone misses the gag.Jim Carrey delivers with an excellent cast. The standout is of course Morgan Freeman as ""God"". Humour, seriousness, and power, all together, just like Freeman did in HARD RAIN.So what if the plot is a rehash.The point here is that it is Jim Carrey  doing the Schtick, and  it obviously has worked, since the film enjoyed decent box-office, and seems to be selling well on DVD and etc.For my money, the visual gags like the post it sequence, are just hilarious. And the extras show how Carey's work happens... it is spontaneous... I think the out-takes show that, and the deleted  scenes show plenty about how the film was put together. The commentary is more of a how Jim's chemistry functions sort of thing. Almost like the way some directors have used Robin Williams was unscripted in some films, and basically asked to just ""Let Loose"". However, both Carrey and Williams  have done totally  scripted work, and whilst Williams is the superior actor at this stage of the game, Carrey is still in the race, and will probably  continue to produce excellent work ( although, I am inclined to think he will not top Williams, especially after seeing JACOB THE LIAR), however, Jim is as Jim does, and he does it so VERY  well.ENJOY",5,"Funny, Raucous, and Totally Jim",1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,1530,"['Bonus', 'Post', 'got', 'DVD', 'was', 'kind', 'cool.Very', 'neat', 'get', 'one', 'Walmart', 'Associates', 'Buttons', 'advertising', 'film', 'well.I', 'am', 'getting', 'point', 'films', 'opinion', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'trying', 'explain', 'joke', 'someone', 'gag.Jim', 'Carrey', 'delivers', 'excellent', 'cast', 'standout', 'course', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'God', 'Humour', 'seriousness', 'power', 'together', 'just', 'Freeman', 'did', 'HARD', 'RAIN.So', 'what', 'plot', 'rehash.The', 'point', 'here', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'doing', 'Schtick', 'obviously', 'worked', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'decent', 'box-office', 'be', 'selling', 'well', 'DVD', 'etc.For', 'money', 'visual', 'gags', 'post', 'sequence', 'are', 'just', 'hilarious', 'extras', 'show', 'how', 'Carey', 'work', 'spontaneous', 'think', 'out-takes', 'show', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'show', 'plenty', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'commentary', 'more', 'how', 'Jim', 'chemistry', 'functions', 'sort', 'thing', 'way', 'directors', 'have', 'used', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'was', 'unscripted', 'films', 'basically', 'asked', 'just', 'Let', 'Loose', 'However', 'Carrey', 'Williams', 'have', 'done', 'totally', 'scripted', 'work', 'whilst', 'Williams', 'superior', 'actor', 'stage', 'game', 'Carrey', 'still', 'race', 'will', 'probably', 'continue', 'produce', 'excellent', 'work', 'am', 'inclined', 'think', 'will', 'not', 'top', 'Williams', 'especially', 'seeing', 'JACOB', 'THE', 'LIAR', 'however', 'Jim', 'Jim', 'so', 'VERY', 'well.ENJOY']",Bruce Almighty
763912,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B0000AKCKI,Scott Kolecki,"[2, 2]","Jim Carrey can truly be considered one of the great phyiscal comedians of this generation, and maybe of all time.  His earlier films have demonstrated his skill to be funny, at times being ridiculous, even outright bizarre, but they have also demonstrated his immense ability to put comedy on the shelf and rely on his abilities as a &quot;serious&quot; actor. &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; takes whats best about Jim Carrey and blends them together into a comedy that is much more than just stupid humor.It is the story of Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), a struggling, but inspired, news anchor whose daily struggles to be recognized as a reputable news anchor never quite become reality.  Instead, he is always beaten out by Evan Baxter (Steven Carrell) to a point where, during a broadcast, Nolan has a public breakdown which costs him his job.  Down-trodden and desperate, he denounces God after his life seems to have become completely unglued.And God is listening.God (Morgan Freeman) approaches Nolan and suggests that Bruce take over for him so that he can take a vacation.  After all, eternity has taken its toll and he could use the break.  When Bruce is returned to his life, he discovers he has almost unlimited power...the power of God.What follows is a hilarious romp with Bruce Almighty at the controls of the universe.  His anctics help him get back his job, and his fame rises as he &quot;miraculously&quot; breaks newsstory after newstory, always being in the right place at the right time-from finding Jimmy Hoffa's body to capturing the image of a meteor crashing into the earth behind him while he covers a news event.  It seems his powers give him a new life, but at the same time, his self-indulgence begins to take its toll on the world around him.The comedy of this film is rich, with plenty of visual anctics that really make it hilarious.  However, it is not only the comedy that makes this movie work.  Jim Carrey delivers a performance that makes his a very likable (and believable) character.  The relationship between his character and Grace (Jennifer Aniston) becomes a pivotal part of the film, and unlike so many comedies where the romantic interest is superficial to the story, her character is vital, and provides for a great secondary story to engage in.Of course, the physical comedy of this film is priceless. The exchange midway into the film (spoiler ahead!) between Nolan and Evan Baxter, when Bruce uses his powers to humiliate and destroy Evan during a newscast is priceless.  How the actors managed to stay in character during this sequence is unbelievable, and, surprisingly, it is Steven Carrell who steals the humor in this scene.The other great surprise in this film is that it attempts to be more than funny.  Where subject matter regarding God can quickly become irreverant, &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; manages to blend humor with a level of respect to the subject matter that leaves the viewer with a subtle lesson in faith and a glimpse at a greater understanding about the divinity of God.  Morgan Freeman, who is legend in Hollywood to begin with, presents his version of God with a wisdom and respect that make him completely convincing.This is comedy at its best.  Not as crazy as some of Carrey's earlier work, it is nonetheless a great film and a lot of fun, with enough of Carrey's classic style of humor to keep his devout fans entertained and to keep all audiences engaged from beginning to end.Scott Kolecki",5,"A Great, Funny Film With a Message....",1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,3460,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'great', 'phyiscal', 'comedians', 'generation', 'maybe', 'time', 'earlier', 'films', 'have', 'demonstrated', 'skill', 'be', 'funny', 'times', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'outright', 'bizarre', 'have', 'also', 'demonstrated', 'immense', 'ability', 'put', 'comedy', 'shelf', 'rely', 'abilities', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', 'actor', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'quot', 'whats', 'best', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'together', 'comedy', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'stupid', 'humor.It', 'story', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'struggling', 'inspired', 'news', 'anchor', 'daily', 'be', 'recognized', 'reputable', 'news', 'anchor', 'never', 'quite', 'become', 'reality', 'Instead', 'always', 'beaten', 'out', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'Steven', 'Carrell', 'point', 'where', 'broadcast', 'Nolan', 'public', 'breakdown', 'job', 'Down-trodden', 'desperate', 'God', 'life', 'have', 'become', 'completely', 'unglued.And', 'God', 'listening.God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Nolan', 'Bruce', 'take', 'over', 'so', 'can', 'take', 'vacation', 'eternity', 'taken', 'toll', 'could', 'use', 'break', 'When', 'Bruce', 'returned', 'life', 'almost', 'unlimited', 'power', 'power', 'God.What', 'hilarious', 'romp', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'controls', 'universe', 'anctics', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'job', 'fame', 'quot', 'miraculously', 'quot', 'breaks', 'newsstory', 'newstory', 'always', 'being', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time-from', 'finding', 'Jimmy', 'Hoffa', 'body', 'capturing', 'image', 'meteor', 'crashing', 'earth', 'news', 'event', 'powers', 'give', 'new', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'self-indulgence', 'take', 'toll', 'world', 'him.The', 'comedy', 'film', 'rich', 'plenty', 'visual', 'anctics', 'really', 'make', 'hilarious', 'However', 'not', 'only', 'comedy', 'movie', 'work', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'very', 'likable', 'believable', 'character', 'relationship', 'character', 'Grace', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'pivotal', 'part', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'comedies', 'where', 'romantic', 'interest', 'superficial', 'story', 'character', 'vital', 'great', 'secondary', 'story', 'engage', 'in.Of', 'course', 'physical', 'comedy', 'film', 'priceless', 'exchange', 'midway', 'film', 'spoiler', 'ahead', 'Nolan', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'when', 'Bruce', 'powers', 'humiliate', 'destroy', 'Evan', 'newscast', 'priceless', 'How', 'actors', 'managed', 'stay', 'character', 'sequence', 'unbelievable', 'surprisingly', 'Steven', 'Carrell', 'who', 'humor', 'scene.The', 'other', 'great', 'surprise', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'funny', 'Where', 'subject', 'matter', 'regarding', 'God', 'can', 'quickly', 'become', 'irreverant', 'quot', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'quot', 'blend', 'humor', 'level', 'respect', 'subject', 'matter', 'viewer', 'subtle', 'lesson', 'faith', 'glimpse', 'greater', 'understanding', 'divinity', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'legend', 'Hollywood', 'begin', 'presents', 'version', 'God', 'wisdom', 'respect', 'make', 'completely', 'convincing.This', 'comedy', 'best', 'Not', 'as', 'crazy', 'Carrey', 'earlier', 'work', 'nonetheless', 'great', 'film', 'lot', 'fun', 'enough', 'Carrey', 'classic', 'style', 'humor', 'keep', 'devout', 'fans', 'entertained', 'keep', 'audiences', 'engaged', 'beginning', 'end.Scott', 'Kolecki']",Bruce Almighty

We question God's plans for us, but in the end, He knows the best for every single one of us. And even if we think we could do a better job than Him, think again.

763917,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0000AKCKI,Tucker Andersen,"[2, 2]","Your reaction to this movie will depend on your expectations, it is neither ACE VENTURA nor THE MAJESTIC. The movie OH GOD had John Denver as the earnest nonbeliever and straightman for the comic George Burns as a playful God. BRUCE ALMIGHTY reverses the typecasting; it has the wild and wacky Jim Carrey as the playful and irreverent reporter Bruce Nolan who is suddenly given the powers of The Almighty, played with wonderfully understated grace and perserverance by Morgan Freeman. The story is simplicity itself, Jim Carrey is a TV reporter with a real talent for doing human interest stories with a humorous twist, but who feels underappreciated and yearns for a spot on his Buffalo NY station's anchor desk. His longtime girlfriend Grace Connelly (played by Jennifer Aniston) also feels somewhat taken for granted, since Bruce seems to be more concerned about his career than their relationship. The stresses in Bruce's life suddenly converge when he is fired from his job after a disastrous (and hilarious) live interview conducted on THE MAID OF THE MIST while under Niagara Falls. Never particularly religious despite his girlfriend's entreaties to seek comfort from prayer, in a defiant gesture Bruce totally rejects all belief in the possibility of any help from God. Supposedly summoned by pager to a job interview, in a wonderful encounter with incredible symbolism (an all white environment with a black God) Morgan Freeman endows Bruce with the powers of THE ALMIGHTY and challenges him to do a better job while obeying only two seemingly simple rules. Then the fun, adventure and suddenly changed trajectory of Bruce's life begins.If you want to see Jim Carrey at his comic best, you will love this movie. Imagine what he can do and the havoc that he can create as THE ALL POWERFUL with almost no limitations on his abilities. (The trailers accurately relect this aspect of the film.) Where the movie disappoints in my opinion was its use of comedy to explore the issues which it raises about religion and its role in our lives, personal relationships, pursuit of happiness, and feelings of accomplishment. As you can imagine, Bruce at first refuses to believe that he has been endowed with extraordinary powers, then initially uses them for mundane personal purposes in several really funny incidents. After a few additional visits and consultations with Morgan Freeman, Bruce gradually comes to accept the fact that being almighty is more complicated and involves more responsibility than simply creating personal gratification. The next lesson also involves the fact that there are often unintended consequences which stem from good (as well as bad) intentions; one person's good fortune may cause problems for someone else. Despite the serious undertone, the comedic aspects of the incidents inevitably dominate the storyline.While comedy can be a wonderful way to enlighten as well as entertain, in many instances this film instead opts for complete farce. This aspect combines with the fact that many of the miracles are more like cheap magic tricks rather than almighty acts to lessen the potential of the film to be truly thoughtprovoking. (It also means that regardless of which faith you espouse, if you have strongly fundamentalist religious beliefs you may be offended by some aspects of this movie.) There were some great issues raised, but always implicitly with the exception of the role of free will; it appears that the filmmakers kept their story very bland to reamin as inoffensive as possible; but that seems at odds with a story about a man and his encounter with THE ALMIGHTY.This was an interesting movie that I want to see again to test my first reaction. I enjoyed the humor immensely; I watched it in a crowded theater and the entire audience laughed hysterically at times. Morgan Freeman was superb in a limited although central role, and Jennifer Aniston was perfect as the frustrated girlfriend. The dog was a lovable character as well. TWO IMPORTANT NOTES: first, don't leave when the credits start rolling, there are some subsequent great outtakes; second, pay particular attention to the signs held up periodically by Jack Jozefson (the homeless man) - they are not only wonderfully apropos but one of the methods by which the message of the story is subtly, if only silently, conveyed. So while I highly recommend this film, my four star rating relects the fact that the attempts to play for comedy and blandness kept it far from what could have been its six star potential.",4,What Would YOU Do If You Were THE ALMIGHTY ?,1053820800,"05 25, 2003",2003,4523,"['reaction', 'movie', 'will', 'depend', 'expectations', 'ACE', 'VENTURA', 'THE', 'MAJESTIC', 'movie', 'OH', 'GOD', 'had', 'John', 'Denver', 'earnest', 'nonbeliever', 'straightman', 'comic', 'George', 'Burns', 'playful', 'God', 'BRUCE', 'ALMIGHTY', 'typecasting', 'wild', 'wacky', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'playful', 'irreverent', 'reporter', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'who', 'suddenly', 'given', 'powers', 'Almighty', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'grace', 'perserverance', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'story', 'simplicity', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'TV', 'reporter', 'real', 'talent', 'doing', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'humorous', 'twist', 'who', 'feels', 'underappreciated', 'yearns', 'spot', 'Buffalo', 'NY', 'station', 'anchor', 'desk', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Connelly', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'also', 'somewhat', 'taken', 'granted', 'Bruce', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'career', 'relationship', 'stresses', 'Bruce', 'life', 'suddenly', 'converge', 'when', 'fired', 'job', 'disastrous', 'hilarious', 'live', 'interview', 'conducted', 'THE', 'MAID', 'THE', 'MIST', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'Never', 'particularly', 'religious', 'girlfriend', 'entreaties', 'seek', 'comfort', 'prayer', 'defiant', 'gesture', 'Bruce', 'totally', 'belief', 'possibility', 'help', 'God', 'Supposedly', 'summoned', 'pager', 'job', 'interview', 'wonderful', 'encounter', 'incredible', 'symbolism', 'white', 'environment', 'black', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bruce', 'powers', 'THE', 'ALMIGHTY', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'obeying', 'only', 'two', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'rules', 'Then', 'fun', 'adventure', 'suddenly', 'changed', 'trajectory', 'Bruce', 'life', 'begins.If', 'want', 'see', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'comic', 'best', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'Imagine', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'havoc', 'can', 'create', 'THE', 'ALL', 'POWERFUL', 'almost', 'limitations', 'abilities', 'trailers', 'accurately', 'relect', 'aspect', 'film', 'Where', 'movie', 'disappoints', 'opinion', 'was', 'use', 'comedy', 'explore', 'issues', 'religion', 'role', 'lives', 'personal', 'relationships', 'pursuit', 'happiness', 'feelings', 'accomplishment', 'can', 'imagine', 'Bruce', 'first', 'refuses', 'believe', 'been', 'endowed', 'extraordinary', 'powers', 'then', 'initially', 'mundane', 'personal', 'purposes', 'several', 'really', 'funny', 'incidents', 'few', 'additional', 'visits', 'consultations', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bruce', 'gradually', 'accept', 'fact', 'being', 'almighty', 'more', 'complicated', 'more', 'responsibility', 'simply', 'creating', 'personal', 'gratification', 'next', 'lesson', 'also', 'fact', 'are', 'often', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'stem', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'bad', 'intentions', 'one', 'person', 'good', 'fortune', 'may', 'cause', 'problems', 'someone', 'else', 'serious', 'undertone', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'incidents', 'inevitably', 'dominate', 'storyline.While', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'wonderful', 'way', 'enlighten', 'as', 'well', 'entertain', 'many', 'instances', 'film', 'instead', 'opts', 'complete', 'farce', 'aspect', 'combines', 'fact', 'many', 'miracles', 'are', 'more', 'cheap', 'magic', 'tricks', 'rather', 'almighty', 'acts', 'lessen', 'potential', 'film', 'be', 'truly', 'thoughtprovoking', 'also', 'regardless', 'faith', 'espouse', 'have', 'strongly', 'fundamentalist', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'aspects', 'movie', 'were', 'great', 'issues', 'raised', 'always', 'implicitly', 'exception', 'role', 'free', 'will', 'filmmakers', 'kept', 'story', 'very', 'bland', 'reamin', 'as', 'inoffensive', 'possible', 'odds', 'story', 'man', 'encounter', 'THE', 'ALMIGHTY.This', 'was', 'interesting', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'test', 'first', 'reaction', 'enjoyed', 'humor', 'immensely', 'watched', 'crowded', 'theater', 'entire', 'audience', 'laughed', 'hysterically', 'times', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'superb', 'limited', 'central', 'role', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'was', 'perfect', 'frustrated', 'girlfriend', 'dog', 'was', 'lovable', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'TWO', 'IMPORTANT', 'NOTES', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'when', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', 'are', 'subsequent', 'great', 'outtakes', 'second', 'pay', 'particular', 'attention', 'signs', 'held', 'up', 'periodically', 'Jack', 'Jozefson', 'homeless', 'man', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'wonderfully', 'apropos', 'one', 'methods', 'message', 'story', 'subtly', 'only', 'silently', 'conveyed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'fact', 'attempts', 'play', 'comedy', 'blandness', 'kept', 'far', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'six', 'star', 'potential']",Bruce Almighty

The show is loaded with star power including Jennifer Aniston as his girl friend & Morgan Freeman who was amazing playing God.  In this show Bruce (Jim Carey) is complaining about his life and curses God so God gives him his powers for a little while to see how he can handle it.

He is very believable in everthing he does and he does it well. However, sometimes it doesn't automatically mean that the movie pertaining to his role will be any good. ie- The awful Cable Guy, Liar Liar, and even Bruce Almighty. It wasn't as bad as the other 2, but it was not that good either. It was barely funny, there were only a couple of really decent sorta funny moments.The story was bland and got very repetetive, very quickly. Jennifer Aniston's character was annoying and did nothing for the film. Jim Carrey sure looked like he was having fun though. His character, while interesting enough, still couldn't really save the movie. Morgan Freeman does a fine job, as usual in his small but important role.If you are looking for effective , funny Jim Carrey comedies, skip this and check out Dumb and Dumber or The Mask.

763920,A3GFOHZK47GEZQ,B0000AKCKI,"Virginia Trammell Jericho ""Virgie""","[2, 2]","Bruce Almighty is a film that really does a good job at getting Jim Carrey back on track.  Some may disagree, but I personally thought that after Ace Ventura that his character roles within the family based pop culture shows were getting a little strange.  A great balancing act to his character is the fact that just about anyone can relate to the issues that are presented.  Another great thing about this film is Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman.  With a cast like this, you cannot go wrong unless the script is a mess.It is great, and as Carrey's character Bruce soon gets what he wishes for so to speak, he only continues to lose focus of what is really important.  Bruce Almighty floats around the idea of someone else taking the job of ""God"" for a while, and does it with all of the candor, comedy and great acting it can muster.  Aniston is very genuine in the film as well, and gives the relationship part of the story more believeability.

The story line was great, the humor was great, and the actors Jennifer Aniston and Jim Carrey were great.Jim Carrey's character is a news reporter who feels his life is going nowhere.  Every time something happens he curses God.  One day God gives Jim Carrey his powers and tells him to make the world better in twenty four hours.  At first he takes his powers for granted but eventually learns that he has to help people.  He realizes how God has this job to help others who are more needy.  Getting Gods powers becomes a turning point which makes him realize his inner feelings. He learns more about life and is able to communicate and understand his girl friends Jennifer Ansiton better.Just when you think Jim Carrey wont be able to top his other movies he does.  This is one family film that will have everyone cracking up.  There is not just the humor but the relationship between Jim and Jenn's characters that is so believable.
