718776,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00006JNAV,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 10]","I was really excited about this movie, but I found it underwhelming and at times just plain bad.  I need to read the novel, and maybe it was the accents that threw me (beings that it was hard to hear and or follow at times) but that's never been an issue with me before, especially if the movie is good.  That isn't to say that `Brighton Rock' is bad, but it just didn't do it for me like I wanted it to.  Overall, the performances were stellar, except for Richard Attenborough, who I found to be a major weak link.  Seriously, what is with all the boundless praise for his performance?  I found it clich&eacute;d and at times totally unbelievable.  The actors around him certainly drove the film for him.  The direction was also nicely crafted and the mood was set beautifully, with expert cinematography that milked the screen, creating a character all its own in Brighton.Still, the film is lacking.I found it a struggle to get on board with the films actual prose, which I found to be ineffectively constructed.  The idea of a hoodlum marrying a girl he loathes just to drive her to suicide so she can't squeal on him for bumping off a rival is far fetched and really needs serious innovation used to give it even the remotest air of honesty.  I mean, if he was so willing to kill a man why wouldn't he kill the girl?  It just doesn't make sense, and I don't get the impression from `Brighton Rock' that it wanted us to suspend disbelief.Still, I can't say that this was a total waste because it wasn't.  Like I said, the supporting cast was seriously stellar, especially Carol Marsh who sunk her teeth into that nave role of Rose, the beautiful waitress who marries a monster.  The final scene, with the record, is phenomenally played out.Hauntingly effective considering the lack of conviction I got from the film as a whole.Hermoine Baddeley and William Hartnell were equally impressive, but I find it sad that the main thing I got from this film was the insatiably need to own a suit like the one Hartnell's character Dallow sports throughout the entire film.Alas, the film needed that extra something to take it over the edge, but it never got it.  This is sad since it had all the makings of a memorably crime thriller.  While it remains visually captivating, the lack of follow-through (plot-wise) makes `Brighton Rock' a failed attempt at something great.",3,It needed something more...,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,2367,"['was', 'really', 'excited', 'movie', 'found', 'underwhelming', 'times', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'need', 'read', 'novel', 'maybe', 'was', 'accents', 'threw', 'beings', 'was', 'hard', 'hear', 'follow', 'times', 'never', 'been', 'issue', 'especially', 'movie', 'good', ""n't"", 'say', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'bad', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'wanted', 'Overall', 'performances', 'were', 'stellar', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'who', 'found', 'be', 'major', 'weak', 'link', 'Seriously', 'what', 'boundless', 'praise', 'performance', 'found', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'times', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'actors', 'certainly', 'drove', 'film', 'direction', 'was', 'also', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'mood', 'was', 'set', 'beautifully', 'expert', 'cinematography', 'milked', 'screen', 'creating', 'character', 'own', 'Brighton.Still', 'film', 'lacking.I', 'struggle', 'get', 'board', 'films', 'actual', 'prose', 'found', 'be', 'ineffectively', 'constructed', 'idea', 'hoodlum', 'marrying', 'girl', 'just', 'drive', 'suicide', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'squeal', 'bumping', 'off', 'rival', 'far', 'fetched', 'really', 'serious', 'innovation', 'used', 'give', 'even', 'remotest', 'air', 'honesty', 'mean', 'was', 'so', 'willing', 'kill', 'man', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'kill', 'girl', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'wanted', 'suspend', 'disbelief.Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'was', ""n't"", 'said', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'seriously', 'stellar', 'especially', 'Carol', 'Marsh', 'who', 'sunk', 'teeth', 'nave', 'role', 'Rose', 'beautiful', 'waitress', 'who', 'monster', 'final', 'scene', 'record', 'phenomenally', 'played', 'out.Hauntingly', 'effective', 'considering', 'lack', 'conviction', 'got', 'film', 'whole.Hermoine', 'Baddeley', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'were', 'equally', 'impressive', 'find', 'main', 'thing', 'got', 'film', 'was', 'insatiably', 'need', 'own', 'suit', 'one', 'Hartnell', 'character', 'Dallow', 'sports', 'entire', 'film.Alas', 'film', 'needed', 'extra', 'something', 'take', 'edge', 'never', 'got', 'sad', 'had', 'makings', 'memorably', 'crime', 'thriller', 'visually', 'captivating', 'lack', 'follow-through', 'plot-wise', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'failed', 'attempt', 'something', 'great']",N/A
718777,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00006JNAV,C. O. DeRiemer,"[16, 16]","We make our own sordid hell and then we live in it, and the innocents among us deserve what they get because they can't tell the difference. Not exactly Graham Greene with his Catholic conflicts, but this excellent film written by Greene (and Terence Rattigan) from Greene's novel certainly sets up the issues. Brighton Rock is an excellent movie, scarcely dated, and features one of Richard Attenborough's most effective performances. His Pinkie Brown will wipe away all those avuncular grandfathers and Santas he's been playing the last few years. Please note that elements of the plot are discussedPinkie leads a small criminal gang in Brighton in the late Thirties. The gang's former leader was betrayed by a man named Fred Hale. When Hale is spotted in the guise of newspaper reporter Kolley Kibber passing out coupons near the Brighton pier in a promotion stunt for the paper, Hale's health is about to fail. Pinkie and the gang face Hale in a pub, then follow him through the streets of Brighton waiting for an opportunity to kill him. On the Brighton pier Hale meets Ida Arnold, a blowzy, cheery woman he encountered in the pub, and pleads with her to stay with him. She agrees, but then must leave him for a moment to retrieve a handkerchief. Frightened out of his wits, he gets on a tunnel of frights ride...and at the last moment Pinkie slips into the seat next to him. Hale is dead before the ride ends. Now Pinkie realizes there are a couple of loose ends. He kills one and marries the other, an innocent young waitress named Rose who saw more than she should have. A wife, after all, can't testify against her husband. Before long, Pinkie is plotting a double suicide for himself and Rose. Naturally, she'll go first. I'm not giving anything away, but things at last don't turn out Pinkie's way.Did I mention? Pinkie is a puritanical sociopath. He doesn't smoke, doesn't drink and prefers to use a straight razor. He's 17. His gang has only three other members, all older. He dominates them because he knows what he wants, he's calm and he doesn't hesitate to take action. He can become violent, but with all the emotion of a snake. He marries his young waitress to get an alibi. While she naively loves him with all her heart, he can barely keep from showing his impatience and revulsion for her. On the Brighton pier together she sees a recording kiosk where people can make a record of their voices. Make a recording for me, she begs Pinkie, so I'll always have something that tells me how you feel. While Rose, outside the booth and unable to hear, gazes at him through the glass, Pinkie speaks into the mike. ""You wanted a recording of my voice, well here it is. What you want me to say is, 'I love you'. Well I don't. I hate you, you little slut... "" They don't have a gramophone so Pinkie knows she can't play the record. Pinkie wants security and power. He sees both slipping away as stronger competition from another gang moves in, as his own gang starts to crumble and as the relentless Ida Howard dogs his steps, pulling the police behind her. It all comes together in the rain late at night on the pier.Attenborough was 24 when he played Pinkie. It was his breakthrough performance, and he's so good it's a wonder he wasn't typecast. Pinkie's age is not made much of; we learn it only when we learn he is underage, as is Rose, and must utilize a corrupt, aged lawyer to arrange the marriage ceremony. The off-hand way we realize how young Pinkie is makes his youth and his cold behavior even more disturbing. Hermione Baddeley as Ida, loud, vulgar and loving a drink and a good time, and William Hartnell as Dallow, the senior member of Pinkie's gang and a hard man with a certain degree of loyalty, are excellent. One of the major stars is Brighton, itself, and how it has been photographed. There's the pier and the rides and the beach chairs, of course, but this Brighton also has grubby and depressing boarding houses, loud pubs and narrow, dark streets and alleys. The location photography brings out all the grit and desperation.Graham Greene is even more worth reading as he is watching; try his novels and ""entertainments,"" including Brighton Rock. Even so, these three movies with screenplays by Greene are great movies, produced in just three years: Brighton Rock (1947),The Fallen Idol - Criterion Collection(1948) andThe Third Man - Criterion Collection (2-Disc Edition)(1949). The Region two Optimum/Canal DVD of Brighton Rock, available from AmazonUK, is in fine shape. It's one more reason to have a region-free DVD player.",5,"A fine, cold-blooded, violent film thanks to Graham Greene and Richard Attenborough",1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,4564,"['make', 'own', 'sordid', 'hell', 'then', 'live', 'innocents', 'deserve', 'what', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'Not', 'exactly', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Catholic', 'conflicts', 'excellent', 'film', 'written', 'Greene', 'Terence', 'Rattigan', 'Greene', 'novel', 'certainly', 'up', 'issues', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'excellent', 'movie', 'scarcely', 'dated', 'one', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'most', 'effective', 'performances', 'Pinkie', 'Brown', 'will', 'wipe', 'away', 'avuncular', 'grandfathers', 'Santas', 'been', 'playing', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Please', 'note', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'discussedPinkie', 'small', 'criminal', 'gang', 'Brighton', 'late', 'Thirties', 'gang', 'former', 'leader', 'was', 'betrayed', 'man', 'named', 'Fred', 'Hale', 'When', 'Hale', 'spotted', 'guise', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Kolley', 'Kibber', 'passing', 'out', 'coupons', 'Brighton', 'pier', 'promotion', 'stunt', 'paper', 'Hale', 'health', 'fail', 'Pinkie', 'gang', 'face', 'Hale', 'pub', 'then', 'follow', 'streets', 'Brighton', 'waiting', 'opportunity', 'kill', 'Brighton', 'pier', 'Hale', 'Ida', 'Arnold', 'blowzy', 'cheery', 'woman', 'encountered', 'pub', 'pleads', 'stay', 'then', 'must', 'leave', 'moment', 'retrieve', 'handkerchief', 'Frightened', 'wits', 'tunnel', 'frights', 'ride', 'last', 'moment', 'Pinkie', 'seat', 'next', 'Hale', 'dead', 'ride', 'Now', 'Pinkie', 'are', 'couple', 'loose', 'ends', 'one', 'other', 'innocent', 'young', 'waitress', 'named', 'Rose', 'who', 'saw', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'wife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'testify', 'husband', 'long', 'Pinkie', 'plotting', 'double', 'suicide', 'Rose', 'Naturally', ""'ll"", 'go', 'first', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'things', 'last', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'Pinkie', 'way.Did', 'mention', 'Pinkie', 'puritanical', 'sociopath', ""n't"", 'smoke', ""n't"", 'drink', 'prefers', 'use', 'straight', 'razor', '17', 'gang', 'only', 'three', 'other', 'members', 'older', 'what', 'calm', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'take', 'action', 'can', 'become', 'violent', 'emotion', 'snake', 'young', 'waitress', 'get', 'alibi', 'naively', 'heart', 'can', 'barely', 'keep', 'showing', 'impatience', 'revulsion', 'Brighton', 'pier', 'together', 'recording', 'kiosk', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'make', 'record', 'voices', 'Make', 'recording', 'Pinkie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'something', 'how', 'feel', 'Rose', 'booth', 'unable', 'hear', 'gazes', 'glass', 'Pinkie', 'mike', 'wanted', 'recording', 'voice', 'well', 'here', 'What', 'want', 'say', 'love', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'little', 'slut', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'gramophone', 'so', 'Pinkie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'record', 'Pinkie', 'security', 'power', 'slipping', 'away', 'stronger', 'competition', 'gang', 'own', 'gang', 'crumble', 'relentless', 'Ida', 'Howard', 'steps', 'pulling', 'police', 'together', 'rain', 'late', 'night', 'pier.Attenborough', 'was', '24', 'when', 'played', 'Pinkie', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'typecast', 'Pinkie', 'age', 'not', 'made', 'much', 'learn', 'only', 'when', 'learn', 'underage', 'Rose', 'must', 'utilize', 'corrupt', 'aged', 'lawyer', 'arrange', 'marriage', 'ceremony', 'off-hand', 'way', 'realize', 'how', 'young', 'Pinkie', 'youth', 'cold', 'behavior', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'Hermione', 'Baddeley', 'Ida', 'loud', 'vulgar', 'loving', 'drink', 'good', 'time', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'Dallow', 'senior', 'member', 'Pinkie', 'gang', 'hard', 'man', 'certain', 'degree', 'loyalty', 'are', 'excellent', 'One', 'major', 'stars', 'Brighton', 'how', 'been', 'photographed', 'pier', 'rides', 'beach', 'chairs', 'course', 'Brighton', 'also', 'grubby', 'depressing', 'boarding', 'houses', 'loud', 'pubs', 'narrow', 'dark', 'streets', 'alleys', 'location', 'photography', 'out', 'grit', 'desperation.Graham', 'Greene', 'even', 'more', 'worth', 'reading', 'watching', 'try', 'novels', 'entertainments', 'including', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'Even', 'so', 'three', 'movies', 'screenplays', 'Greene', 'are', 'great', 'movies', 'produced', 'just', 'three', 'years', 'Brighton', 'Rock', '1947', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '1948', 'andThe', 'Third', 'Man', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '2-Disc', 'Edition', '1949', 'Region', 'two', 'Optimum/Canal', 'DVD', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'available', 'AmazonUK', 'fine', 'shape', 'one', 'more', 'reason', 'have', 'region-free', 'DVD', 'player']",N/A

718784,A2T0L6RPRVP3UC,B00006JNAV,Nobody,"[3, 3]","`Brighton Rock' is essentially a tale of a teenage gangster, Pinkie Brown, and his attempts to silence a potential witness, Rose, to a crime. John Boulting (Thunder Rock, 1942; I'm All Right Jack, 1959) directed it in 1947 and was producer by his twin brother Roy. The screenplay was adapted from the Graham Greene novel of the same name by Terence Rattigan. There are significant differences at the ending of the film in relation to the novel (the book is more brutal) but I think that it takes nothing away from the film or the book. Due to BBFC rules at the time some changes had to made to the intended ending (the record scene) of the film because they wanted it to have a happy ending, which I think in retrospect made it better. The only feature really missing is the strength of character development one could only expect from a novel. However saying all that, the adaptation is excellent.`Brighton Rock' featured two brilliant performances from Richard Attenborough (In Which We Serve, 1942; A Matter Of Life And Death, 1946) as Pinkie and Carol Marsh as Rose. Richard's performance is a career highlight for him, which could be regarded as the emergence of the `angry young man' in British cinema, but it was Carol's performance that I really loved. Her performance of innocence is something we so rarely see in modern cinema that it is remarkably refreshing to watch. One thing worth pointing out though is that Rose in the novel was not quite as pretty and we see more of her family life and the possible reason for her attachment to Pinkie. Carol Marsh never made many other significant films that I feel it's a bit of a shame because I think we've missed something there. I place her performance alongside Dorothy Malone's bit part in `The Big Sleep' (1946) who we also never saw enough of sadly.Cinematography on `Brighton Rock' was by Gilbert Taylor who would later work on films such as `Repulsion' (Polanski, 1965) `Dr Strangelove' (Kubrick, 1964) and the much loved `Star Wars' (Lucas, 1977). Other films adapted from Graham Greene novels worth watching are `This Gun For Hire' (Tuttle, 1942) which has a similar theme and the excellent `The Third Man' (Reed, 1949).

The recent remake transplanted the story to the 60s and changed quite a few more details; I think this original is better, and it regularly makes lists of top British films as well.  The main character is a psychopathic teenage gangster named Pinkie (played by a very young Richard Attenborough), and he is truly menacing to the point where he can practically scare people to death.  When a newspaperman on assignment to Brighton runs afoul of Pinkie's mob and later turns up dead, a blowzy boardwalk performer, Ida (Hermione Baddeley) is convinced that Pinkie killed him and sets out to prove it and see justice done.  Meanwhile, Pinkie is romancing a very young and naive waitress, Rose, who also happens to be a witness, and Ida becomes concerned with protecting her as well.  Rose, of course, is the classic good girl who thinks she can help save a very bad guy just by loving him enough, and even if she can't save him, she's willing to go to the ends of the earth and die trying.Will Rose wise up and escape in one piece?  Will Pinkie have a last-minute redemption through the power of love?  Will Ida succeed in getting the cops to take an interest before Rose and/or herself end up dead?  Oddly, there's not as much suspense to all of this as you'd expect, even if you haven't read Greene's book and don't know how it's going to turn out (although if you have read the book, the film's ending differs from it slightly - just enough to be interesting in its own right).  Perhaps the lack of thrills is partly due to liberal use of Catholic symbology of heaven, hell (represented by fire), death, and other holy allusions (another ""witness"" is a blind man being led by a little girl) signifying that in the end, everybody is bound to get the ""reward"" they deserve, and the only question is how they're going to get there.  It's still a good, solid, well-made and well-acted film, and the emphasis on Rose's Catholicism is in keeping with Greene's work.  Also wonderful to see Baddeley in a long meaty role, sort of like a younger brash Jessica Fletcher, rather than her usual character roles as a maid or neighbor or whatnot.  She was one heck of an actress.  It's too bad that in her era, there weren't tons of leading roles for chubby fortyish ladies.Overall, I recommend this version.  It's so awesome, I have no idea why someone felt a need to remake it.  About my only complaint is that the characters' accents and slang can be a little hard for Americans to understand - you need to know that a ""blower"" means the telephone, for instance.  But not too far removed from similarly slang-ridden US vintage gangster films.",4,"Gangsters, Heaven and Hell",1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,2834,"['like', 'classic', 'gangster-psychology', 'films', 'Little', 'Caesar', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'original', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'novel', 'set', 'crumbling', '1930s', 'Brighton', 'recent', 'remake', 'transplanted', 'story', '60s', 'changed', 'quite', 'few', 'more', 'details', 'think', 'original', 'better', 'regularly', 'lists', 'top', 'British', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'character', 'psychopathic', 'teenage', 'gangster', 'named', 'Pinkie', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'truly', 'menacing', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'practically', 'scare', 'people', 'death', 'When', 'newspaperman', 'assignment', 'Brighton', 'afoul', 'Pinkie', 'mob', 'later', 'up', 'dead', 'blowzy', 'boardwalk', 'performer', 'Ida', 'Hermione', 'Baddeley', 'convinced', 'Pinkie', 'killed', 'out', 'prove', 'see', 'justice', 'done', 'Meanwhile', 'Pinkie', 'romancing', 'very', 'young', 'naive', 'waitress', 'Rose', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'witness', 'Ida', 'becomes', 'concerned', 'protecting', 'as', 'well', 'Rose', 'course', 'classic', 'good', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'save', 'very', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'loving', 'enough', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'willing', 'go', 'ends', 'earth', 'die', 'trying.Will', 'Rose', 'wise', 'up', 'escape', 'one', 'piece', 'Will', 'Pinkie', 'have', 'last-minute', 'redemption', 'power', 'love', 'Will', 'Ida', 'succeed', 'getting', 'cops', 'take', 'interest', 'Rose', 'and/or', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'Oddly', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'suspense', ""'d"", 'expect', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Greene', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'ending', 'differs', 'slightly', 'just', 'enough', 'be', 'interesting', 'own', 'right', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'thrills', 'partly', 'due', 'liberal', 'use', 'Catholic', 'symbology', 'heaven', 'hell', 'represented', 'fire', 'death', 'other', 'holy', 'allusions', 'witness', 'blind', 'man', 'being', 'led', 'little', 'girl', 'signifying', 'end', 'everybody', 'bound', 'get', 'reward', 'deserve', 'only', 'question', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'there', 'still', 'good', 'solid', 'well-made', 'well-acted', 'film', 'emphasis', 'Rose', 'Catholicism', 'keeping', 'Greene', 'work', 'Also', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Baddeley', 'long', 'meaty', 'role', 'sort', 'younger', 'brash', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'rather', 'usual', 'character', 'roles', 'maid', 'neighbor', 'whatnot', 'was', 'one', 'heck', 'actress', 'too', 'bad', 'era', 'were', ""n't"", 'tons', 'leading', 'roles', 'chubby', 'fortyish', 'ladies.Overall', 'recommend', 'version', 'so', 'awesome', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'someone', 'felt', 'need', 'remake', 'only', 'complaint', 'characters', 'accents', 'slang', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'Americans', 'understand', 'need', 'know', 'blower', 'telephone', 'instance', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'similarly', 'slang-ridden', 'US', 'vintage', 'gangster', 'films']",N/A
718786,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00006JNAV,Stephanie De Pue,"[0, 0]","""Brighton Rock,"" (1947) is a classic 92-minute black and white film noir adaptation of outstanding British author Graham Greene's classic, early career, downbeat novel of the same name,Brighton Rock. This British mystery/romantic crime drama/thriller was actually adapted for the screen by the 20th century figure Greene himself, working with noted British playwright/screenwriter Terence Rattigan, and was directed by John Boulting, soon to become a comic icon through his work at Ealing Studios.The production is, of course, set in Brighton, once a quiet seaside resort town, with some historic artifacts and buildings from the days when it was a favorite royal resort.  The Brighton Pavilion, which we see here, and I've managed to see a couple of times in my life, is an exotic fantasy made beautiful reality.  Nevertheless, Brighton did, in the 1930s, enter rather a high-crime period, much of it centered on the city's race track.  The rivalry between gangster Pinky Brown's gang and the bigger, more efficient one run by Colletti provides the background, with a riveting scene at the racetrack, where Colletti's boys are waving around straight razors.  Soon Pinky, who runs a protection racket at the race course, has ordered the death of Fred Hale, member of Coletti's gang.  The police believe the rival mobster's death to be suicide.  But Ida Arnold was with Fred just before he died, and does not believe he killed himself.  She sets out to find the truth.  The none-too-bright Rose, who waitresses at the local tea room, Snow's, has somehow witnessed the murder. Older and wiser heads in his gang advise Pinky to romance, seduce and marry the waitress, in hopes of preventing her telling the police what she saw. So Pinky begins  this program, which he finds rather distasteful. But, unfortunately, he has been destabilized by recent events; he will become more desperate and violent, and will begin to act out in ultimately self-destructive ways.  Pinky murders one of one of his own gang on a beach front amusement park ride; tries to cover it up, and has growing difficulty dealing with his people.A young Richard Attenborough, at the start of his long, prolific, greatly honored career, as actor/ director/producer, stars as Pinky.  Lord Richard Attenborough, as he now is styled, gives a performance full of menace and malice that I, for one, having only seen some of his later work, never imagined he had in him.  In the 1950s, Attenborough worked in several successful Ealing comedies, includingI'm All Right Jack.  He won back to back Golden Globes as Best Supporting Actor forThe Sand PebblesandDoctor Dolittle; and Golden Globe and Oscar Awards for Best Director forGandhi; as that film's producer, he also won the Oscar for Best Film.The picture's b/w cinematography, by Harry Waxman, is superb, deep focused, and moody, and, for once, the sea looks threatening, rather than that picture postcard bright smiley blue.  The gang members also look a lot meaner in this black and white treatment than they ever could in color.  As most all of Catholic convert Graham Greene's works (The End of the Affair, The Power and the Glory), the film deals with the big Catholic questions of sin, guilt and redemption. Greene, by authoring both the underlying novel and the screenplay has been able to give Pinky a depth of character not usually seen in a villain, and the movie a similar depth.  Well worth seeing.",4,"For Once, The Sea Looks Threatening",1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,3424,"['Brighton', 'Rock', '1947', 'classic', '92-minute', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'noir', 'adaptation', 'outstanding', 'British', 'author', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'classic', 'early', 'career', 'downbeat', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Brighton', 'Rock', 'British', 'mystery/romantic', 'crime', 'drama/thriller', 'was', 'actually', 'adapted', 'screen', '20th', 'century', 'figure', 'Greene', 'working', 'noted', 'British', 'playwright/screenwriter', 'Terence', 'Rattigan', 'was', 'directed', 'John', 'Boulting', 'soon', 'become', 'comic', 'icon', 'work', 'Ealing', 'Studios.The', 'production', 'course', 'set', 'Brighton', 'once', 'quiet', 'seaside', 'resort', 'town', 'historic', 'artifacts', 'buildings', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'favorite', 'royal', 'resort', 'Brighton', 'Pavilion', 'see', 'here', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'see', 'couple', 'times', 'life', 'exotic', 'fantasy', 'made', 'beautiful', 'reality', 'Nevertheless', 'Brighton', 'did', '1930s', 'enter', 'rather', 'high-crime', 'period', 'much', 'centered', 'city', 'race', 'track', 'rivalry', 'gangster', 'Pinky', 'Brown', 'gang', 'bigger', 'more', 'efficient', 'one', 'run', 'Colletti', 'background', 'riveting', 'scene', 'racetrack', 'where', 'Colletti', 'boys', 'are', 'waving', 'around', 'straight', 'razors', 'Soon', 'Pinky', 'who', 'protection', 'racket', 'race', 'course', 'ordered', 'death', 'Fred', 'Hale', 'member', 'Coletti', 'gang', 'police', 'believe', 'rival', 'mobster', 'death', 'be', 'suicide', 'Ida', 'Arnold', 'was', 'Fred', 'just', 'died', 'not', 'believe', 'killed', 'out', 'find', 'truth', 'none-too-bright', 'Rose', 'who', 'local', 'tea', 'room', 'Snow', 'somehow', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'Older', 'wiser', 'heads', 'gang', 'advise', 'Pinky', 'romance', 'seduce', 'marry', 'waitress', 'hopes', 'preventing', 'telling', 'police', 'what', 'saw', 'So', 'Pinky', 'program', 'rather', 'distasteful', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'destabilized', 'recent', 'events', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'desperate', 'violent', 'will', 'begin', 'act', 'out', 'ultimately', 'self-destructive', 'ways', 'Pinky', 'one', 'one', 'own', 'gang', 'beach', 'front', 'amusement', 'park', 'ride', 'tries', 'cover', 'up', 'growing', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'people.A', 'young', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'start', 'long', 'prolific', 'greatly', 'honored', 'career', 'actor/', 'director/producer', 'Pinky', 'Lord', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'now', 'styled', 'performance', 'full', 'menace', 'malice', 'one', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'later', 'work', 'never', 'imagined', 'had', '1950s', 'Attenborough', 'worked', 'several', 'successful', 'Ealing', 'comedies', 'includingI', ""'m"", 'Right', 'Jack', 'won', 'back', 'back', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'forThe', 'Sand', 'PebblesandDoctor', 'Dolittle', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Oscar', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Director', 'forGandhi', 'film', 'producer', 'also', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Film.The', 'picture', 'b/w', 'cinematography', 'Harry', 'Waxman', 'superb', 'deep', 'focused', 'moody', 'once', 'sea', 'threatening', 'rather', 'picture', 'postcard', 'bright', 'smiley', 'blue', 'gang', 'members', 'also', 'look', 'lot', 'meaner', 'black', 'white', 'treatment', 'ever', 'could', 'color', 'most', 'Catholic', 'convert', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'works', 'End', 'Affair', 'Power', 'Glory', 'film', 'deals', 'big', 'Catholic', 'questions', 'sin', 'guilt', 'redemption', 'Greene', 'authoring', 'underlying', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'been', 'able', 'give', 'Pinky', 'depth', 'character', 'not', 'usually', 'seen', 'villain', 'movie', 'similar', 'depth', 'Well', 'seeing']",N/A
