1641289,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B00BZMMR5S,.fgd,"[2, 3]","It is a film that rides on the back of a far more sucessful film, judging by the other 3star review here. It is not a good reason to make a film. Wan is the word. On the other hand it is not pretending to be more than it isn't either. So it keeps its integrity intact.  From that springboard, the film revives itself as it goes along by its characters of interest. There are much worse films out there. Another  way of keeping it's credability is because it's british , which tends to have higher standards in terms of taste and senability over-all , than if an american version  copy-catting? Veg out to it if you see it for free on netflix but dont bother to buy it.

1641291,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BZMMR5S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","It's hard to discuss the British crime drama ""Pusher"" without acknowledging that it is a remake of a tremendous Danish film by Nicholas Winding Refn.  Winding Refn, in fact, created a trio of films now known as the Pusher Trilogy (the movies were from 1996, 2004 and 2005) and I would run, not walk, to see them if this genre interests you.  A true auteur, Winding Refn has a brutal machismo and an unrelenting eye for the randomness of violence that is showcased in works including ""Bronson"" with Tom Hardy, ""Valhalla Rising"" with Mads Mikkelsen, ""Drive"" with Ryan Gosling, and the current ""Only God Forgives"" (also with Gosling) which opened to division and controversy at this year's Cannes Film Festival.  I begin with this discussion of Winding Refn, because he endorsed this version with an executive producer credit.  It may not be entirely fair to judge the two films with one another, so I'll try to break it down in a more helpful way.  Fans of the original ""Pusher"" film will likely be disappointed by this rather wan interpretation.  But even if you haven't seen the Danish film, this crime saga feels rather familiar and ordinary.  It's not a terrible movie, by any means, it just isn't as unique or compelling as you might hope.""Pusher"" tells the story of a drug dealer (well played by Richard Coyle) who is having a very bad week indeed.  Coyle fixates on an irresistible scheme to get rich quick.  In pursuit of this deal, he crosses a local crime boss (Zlatko Buric, who also played Milo in the original) and this proves to be a very poor idea.  Never believe in an impossibly good deal!  And be sure you can pay your debts!  In an escalating series of mishaps, nothing goes right for Coyle and his cohort Tony (Bronson Webb).  The movie has Coyle scrambling to stay one step ahead of just about everyone for ninety minutes. As his desperation increases, he attempt to get the money from anyone and everyone.  The pace is fast, the camera work frenetic, and the soundtrack propulsive.  These stylistic touches do nothing, however, to alleviate the fact that you've probably seen dozens of these gritty little British crime dramas.  The film's saving grace is that Coyle pulls out a solid performance.  You can't help but to be caught up in his descent into hopelessness.If you've seen the original, this interpretation offers nothing new in the way of plotting.  The screenplay adheres fairly closely to the one Winding Refn penned.  But where Winding Refn's vision of Copenhagen circa 1996 was something we hadn't seen much of, I've seen plenty of films since set in London's criminal element.  I know several people who absolutely hate this movie, but I can't bring myself to proclaim it worthless.  I'd say it was more unnecessary than anything.  Ironically, there is even a version of ""Pusher"" in Hindi from 2010 so don't get confused when shopping the ""Pusher"" title.  For a treat, pick up the Pusher Trilogy.  I'd rate this at 3 1/2 stars (mostly for Coyle) if you haven't seen the original, and 2 1/2 stars if you have.
