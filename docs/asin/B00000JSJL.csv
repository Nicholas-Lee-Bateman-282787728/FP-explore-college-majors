And all the girls have their own stories and it's fun, even when the dialogue is painfully stupid.Oh, and if anyone cares, there is a 'sequel' anime series that is full ""Hentai"" meaning pornographic, but it's a new cast of characters or a re-visualization or some sort.",5,"Pure fun!

508095,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B00000JSJL,coopertex,"[2, 2]","Variable Geo is a fighting anime mixed with fan service. Waitresses compete in a martial arts tournament in hopesof earning the title as...(get this)..the ""strongest waitress in the world"". Yup, you heard it right. Yes it's true, low paid waitresses aspire to beat up other waitresses and be known as the world's strongest. The winner of the competition wins $10 million dollars and a piece of real estate. The losers have to strip off their clothes and bear their shame to the audience.Yuka, is the main character here and we get to follow her around as she competes in the many boring battles. The action in the fighting sequences are average at best, the martial arts movesdo not look very realistic and were poorly animated. Granted that the series is fantasy based as some of the fighters have powers and can shoot energy beams from their hands or eyes, but the actual physical fighting is weak. The story of course is non-existant. So you might be thinking that at least you'll enjoy the fan service. Let's face it we want to watch anime like this for fan service and you will be disappointed to find out that it is brisk, and far apart. They did NOT include enough topless shots of the female characters and rarely will you see them completely nude! I don't understand why this anime got a ""17+"" rating when the fan service and violence is very minimal and disappointing. I suggest you watch other fighting anime like ""Battle Angel Alita"" , ""Street Fighter II"" and even better ""Ikki Tousen"" ""Fist Of The North Star"" and a bunch of others better fighting anime with fan service too.

508096,A26O0T192IBKY1,B00000JSJL,J. Alford,"[1, 1]","The 90s were a smorgasbord for anime based on fighting games. While the Street Fighter II movie is pretty much the Citizen Kane of that crop, one of the better attempts was Variable Geo. This was one of the first all-female fighting games ever, and to sweeten the fan service even further, all the characters are sexy waitresses. So, try to imagine Hooters girls battling Playboy bunnies!Set in a version of Japan where one of the biggest spectator sports is weirdly not kids card games, a major series of fights called Variable Geo, or ""VG"" is all the rage. This is where waitresses from different restaurants compete for the major prize of ten million dollars, and whatever real estate they want. Yuka is one of the best in the nation, and is cited to be the next champ for the upcoming championship. However, Yuka's fighter friend Satomi(who is basically the Ken to Yuka's Ryu)is also eyeing the prize, mostly to get the funds to pay for her sick brother's operation. While all this is going on, the main company sponsoring VG, the Jahana Group, is really secretly testing all their contestants as candidates for a body that the spirit of the company's deceased female president can be placed in. There's several subplots with rival factors, all of which have ninja girls, plus other contestants getting into VG fights, most of which would probably make sense to anyone who has played the actual video game would be familiar with. But ultimately, it all comes down to mind-controlled battle waitresses and bio-genetic test subjects meeting up in a large showdown at the end, which of course concludes with the two main heroines about to finally have their epic fight just before the closing credits.Despite alot of the criticism that fighting game anime gets, Variable Geo actually managed to pull of a good story, at least for a ecchi-fueled action OVA. They show the characters fighting for more than just the prize, like Yuka's wanting to fight because she feels an empathic connection through battle, and Satomi wanting to save her brother. Even the stereotypical bunnygirl Erina is trying to get the money soley to bring her grandmother home to Japan. The fight sequences aren't cheap either though, and lots of ripped outfits throughout the series. There was a hentai ""sequal"" to this titled VG Neo, which probably delves alot more into nudity than your average prude could deal with. The original is worth at least watching. The only downside is that the video games that its based on have never been released in English.",3,It's Fatal Fury meets Waffle House!,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,2531,"['90s', 'were', 'smorgasbord', 'anime', 'based', 'fighting', 'games', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'II', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'crop', 'one', 'better', 'attempts', 'was', 'Variable', 'Geo', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'all-female', 'fighting', 'games', 'ever', 'sweeten', 'fan', 'service', 'even', 'further', 'characters', 'are', 'sexy', 'waitresses', 'So', 'try', 'imagine', 'Hooters', 'girls', 'battling', 'Playboy', 'bunnies', 'Set', 'version', 'Japan', 'where', 'one', 'biggest', 'spectator', 'sports', 'weirdly', 'not', 'kids', 'card', 'games', 'major', 'series', 'fights', 'called', 'Variable', 'Geo', 'VG', 'rage', 'where', 'waitresses', 'different', 'restaurants', 'compete', 'major', 'prize', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'real', 'estate', 'want', 'one', 'best', 'nation', 'cited', 'be', 'next', 'champ', 'upcoming', 'championship', 'However', 'Yuka', 'fighter', 'friend', 'Satomi', 'who', 'basically', 'Ken', 'Yuka', 'Ryu', 'also', 'eyeing', 'prize', 'mostly', 'get', 'funds', 'pay', 'sick', 'brother', 'operation', 'going', 'main', 'company', 'sponsoring', 'VG', 'Jahana', 'Group', 'really', 'secretly', 'testing', 'contestants', 'candidates', 'body', 'spirit', 'company', 'deceased', 'female', 'president', 'can', 'be', 'placed', 'several', 'subplots', 'rival', 'factors', 'have', 'ninja', 'girls', 'other', 'contestants', 'getting', 'VG', 'fights', 'most', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'sense', 'anyone', 'who', 'played', 'actual', 'video', 'game', 'would', 'be', 'familiar', 'ultimately', 'down', 'mind-controlled', 'battle', 'waitresses', 'bio-genetic', 'test', 'subjects', 'meeting', 'up', 'large', 'showdown', 'end', 'course', 'concludes', 'two', 'main', 'heroines', 'finally', 'have', 'epic', 'fight', 'just', 'closing', 'credits.Despite', 'alot', 'criticism', 'fighting', 'game', 'anime', 'Variable', 'Geo', 'actually', 'managed', 'pull', 'good', 'story', 'least', 'ecchi-fueled', 'action', 'OVA', 'show', 'characters', 'fighting', 'more', 'just', 'prize', 'Yuka', 'wanting', 'fight', 'empathic', 'connection', 'battle', 'Satomi', 'wanting', 'save', 'brother', 'Even', 'stereotypical', 'bunnygirl', 'Erina', 'trying', 'get', 'money', 'soley', 'bring', 'grandmother', 'home', 'Japan', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'lots', 'ripped', 'outfits', 'series', 'was', 'hentai', 'sequal', 'titled', 'VG', 'Neo', 'probably', 'alot', 'more', 'nudity', 'average', 'prude', 'could', 'deal', 'original', 'worth', 'least', 'watching', 'only', 'downside', 'video', 'games', 'based', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'English']",N/A
508097,A1UU6ETAY6TBRH,B00000JSJL,Porcupine,"[0, 0]","After reading some of the reviews of it here I had high hopes for this show and bought the DVD. I like watching good fighting shows with girls fighting, I was hoping this would be one of them. But after watching, this 3-part OAV series (like a movie, essentially) wasn't that great. It was roughly about the quality of the original, old Street Fighter 2 anime movie, or some of the other older anime fighting-game based movies (Fatal Fury, Battle Arena Toshinden, etc). The story proceeds in a similar fashion to those shows, namely being some rigged-up story that doesn't necessarily have to do with the game (I've never played the Variable Geo games but I wonder if the same story dealing with reincarnation and technological body-possession existed in them). Then the various fighters appear one-by-one and fight briefly, then lose and go away never to be seen again. This is the fate of most of those fighting-game anime movies because there are too many fighters in the original game and it is hard to cram them all into a single movie.After watching, I totally agree with the following earlier review:""Fatal Flaw: Takes a Silly Concept Seriously, April 3, 2000I thought 'Variable Geo' sounded like a hoot, so I picked up up. The first ten minutes are the tone I would have expected... but after that, the concept of warrior waitresses is started to be taken seriously not only by the story, but, the episodes assume, by the viewer as well. It's a flaw that turns what could have been a fun romp into a rather excrutiating 80 minutes.""I also thought fighting waitresses sounded hilarious. I was hoping for both good fighting sequences and also a hilarious story revolving around waitressing and funny conversations. But instead, the waitress element pretty much doesn't come into play in the movie at all, the only thing it does is define their clothing as they go around fighting each other in the street. Again, it makes me wonder if the video games are the same way or was some weird insidious crime-organization plot cooked-up just for the movie (as is usually the case for fighting game movies).There are much better serious girl-fighting animes out there. Metal Fighter Miku is pretty good, still one of my all-time favorite animes after more than 10 years. Natsuki Crisis is another girl-fighting classic, but it was never released in the USA!! I really hope someone eventually remembers to pick this 2-episode OAV series up for domestic release.Anyway, my ratings for Variable Geo are:Directing - 2 of 5 stars. The serious tone was a mistake and the show feels kind of cheesy in a bad way. Not terrible though for an anime made 10 years ago.Story - 2 of 5 stars. Plot was about some weird criminal organization and a bad woman trying to live forever, and stuff. Not about waitresses, boo.Drawings - 4 of 5 stars. I like Takahiro Kimura's (Godannar) style of people but he didn't draw as good 10 years ago as he does now.Animation quality - 4 of 5 stars. Excellent but I was expecting more from Takahiro Kimura who usually creates shows with great animation. Fight choreography-wise, Variable Geo is somewhat lacking as well.Music - 4 of 5 stars. Not bad at all. Not amazing, but still a positive.Oh yeah, the voices. Watch the sub version, the pink-haired little girl is Pikachu!! Hahaha! And she does sound exactly like Pikachu. I never knew Pikachu could talk, it's very funny.",3,This is like those old fighting-game based anime movies of the 90's,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,3392,"['reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'show', 'bought', 'DVD', 'watching', 'good', 'fighting', 'shows', 'girls', 'fighting', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'watching', '3-part', 'OAV', 'series', 'movie', 'essentially', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'was', 'roughly', 'quality', 'original', 'old', 'Street', 'Fighter', '2', 'anime', 'movie', 'other', 'older', 'anime', 'fighting-game', 'based', 'movies', 'Fatal', 'Fury', 'Battle', 'Arena', 'Toshinden', 'etc', 'story', 'proceeds', 'similar', 'fashion', 'shows', 'namely', 'being', 'rigged-up', 'story', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'do', 'game', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'Variable', 'Geo', 'games', 'wonder', 'same', 'story', 'dealing', 'reincarnation', 'technological', 'body-possession', 'existed', 'Then', 'various', 'fighters', 'appear', 'one-by-one', 'fight', 'briefly', 'then', 'lose', 'go', 'away', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'fate', 'most', 'fighting-game', 'anime', 'movies', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'fighters', 'original', 'game', 'hard', 'cram', 'single', 'movie.After', 'watching', 'totally', 'agree', 'following', 'earlier', 'review', 'Fatal', 'Flaw', 'Silly', 'Concept', 'Seriously', 'April', '3', '2000I', 'thought', ""'Variable"", 'Geo', 'sounded', 'hoot', 'picked', 'up', 'up', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'tone', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'concept', 'warrior', 'waitresses', 'started', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'not', 'only', 'story', 'episodes', 'assume', 'viewer', 'well', 'flaw', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'romp', 'rather', 'excrutiating', '80', 'minutes', 'also', 'thought', 'fighting', 'waitresses', 'sounded', 'hilarious', 'was', 'hoping', 'good', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'also', 'hilarious', 'story', 'revolving', 'waitressing', 'funny', 'conversations', 'instead', 'waitress', 'element', 'pretty', 'much', ""n't"", 'come', 'play', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'define', 'clothing', 'go', 'around', 'fighting', 'other', 'street', 'Again', 'wonder', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'weird', 'insidious', 'crime-organization', 'plot', 'cooked-up', 'just', 'movie', 'usually', 'case', 'fighting', 'game', 'movies', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'serious', 'girl-fighting', 'animes', 'out', 'there', 'Metal', 'Fighter', 'Miku', 'pretty', 'good', 'still', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'animes', 'more', '10', 'years', 'Natsuki', 'Crisis', 'girl-fighting', 'classic', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'USA', 'really', 'hope', 'someone', 'eventually', 'remembers', 'pick', '2-episode', 'OAV', 'series', 'up', 'domestic', 'release.Anyway', 'ratings', 'Variable', 'Geo', 'are', 'Directing', '2', '5', 'stars', 'serious', 'tone', 'was', 'mistake', 'show', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'bad', 'way', 'Not', 'terrible', 'anime', 'made', '10', 'years', 'ago.Story', '2', '5', 'stars', 'Plot', 'was', 'weird', 'criminal', 'organization', 'bad', 'woman', 'trying', 'live', 'forever', 'stuff', 'Not', 'waitresses', 'boo.Drawings', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Takahiro', 'Kimura', 'Godannar', 'style', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'draw', 'as', 'good', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'now.Animation', 'quality', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Excellent', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'Takahiro', 'Kimura', 'who', 'usually', 'shows', 'great', 'animation', 'Fight', 'choreography-wise', 'Variable', 'Geo', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'well.Music', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Not', 'bad', 'Not', 'amazing', 'still', 'positive.Oh', 'yeah', 'voices', 'Watch', 'sub', 'version', 'pink-haired', 'little', 'girl', 'Pikachu', 'Hahaha', 'sound', 'exactly', 'Pikachu', 'never', 'knew', 'Pikachu', 'could', 'talk', 'very', 'funny']",N/A

I bought the video because there was a buxom babe on the cover and it said &quot;17+&quot;.  (If this makes me a pig, so be it.)  After a few minutes I learned the basis of the movie, namely, waitresses are fighting in a tournament.  The winner gets money; the loser has to take off her clothes.  My first thought on learning this was the intelligent and well-thought-out query: &quot;Whut the--?!&quot;As I watched more, I can't say the premise made a whole lot more sense, but the movie was decent.  The animation was surprisingly good and the fights were cool, though nowhere near the level of Street Fighter II: TAM.  The story was actually pretty good, too, better than SF2 or Fatal Fury: TMP.  The movie also benefitted from who I consider a very cool villain.  This was Damien, the long-limbed, misshapen psychopath whose drug-induced speed and strength make him more than a match for the fighters of the tournament.
