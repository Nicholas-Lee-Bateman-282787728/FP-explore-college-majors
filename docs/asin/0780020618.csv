24267,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0780020618,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 1]","Olivier and Leigh. The husband and wife team of the 40s. Preceded by Fairbanks and Pickford, contemporary with Gable and Lombard and followed by Taylor and Burton.""Fire Over England"" was the first pairing of Laurence Olivier (1907-1989) and his future wife Vivien Leigh (1913-67). They met in 1935 and began their affair during this film. They made several films together, including ""That Hamilton Woman"" (1941), and toured together many times in performances of ""Anthony and Cleopatra"",  ""MacBeth"", ""Twelfth Night"", and ""The School for Scandal"". They divorced in 1960.Leigh is best known for her stunning performances in ""GWTW"" (1939) as Scarlett O'Hara and as Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) - she won the Oscar both times. Eventually physical problems, a miscarriage, and the difficulty of living with Olivier would take their toll and she began a slow descent into madness, perhaps precipitated by the 326 performances as DuBois on stage in London followed by  months filming the movie. Between 1955 and 1965 she made only 1 film, but she carried on with her theatre work and even won a Tony in 1963. Her  last film appearance was in 1965 (""Ship of Fools"").Olivier was nominated for an Oscar 10 times, from 1939 (""Wuthering Heights"") to 1978 (""Boys from Brazil""), and won in 1949 for ""Hamlet"". He appeared in 80+ films, usually as an Englishman or in films based in England.  His prime period had been in the 40s, and he made few films in the 50s, probably because of all the personal problems he was having. He appears as #14 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.Flora Robson (1902-84) appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Saratoga Trunk"" (1945). She played Elizabeth in this film and reprised her role for ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), another Alexander Korda film. Many people believe that she is the definitive Elizabeth, although my preference would be Bette Davis in ""Essex and Elizabeth"" (1939). Other actresses who've played Elizabeth include Glenda Jackson (1971), Helen Mirren (2005), Sarah Bernhardt (1912) and Cate Blanchett (1998, 2007). Actresses who played Elizabeth twice include Robson, Bette Davis (1938, 1955) and Cate Blanchett (1998, 2007).BTW - Robson was only 35 when she appeared in this film. By comparison, Bette Davis was 30 when she first played her and Cate Blancehtt was 29. The film depicts Elizabeth in her mid 50s.Raymond Massey (1896-1983) plays King Philip of Spain. He is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln. He was nominated for an Oscar for playing ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940) which remains, to date, the best ever portrayal of Lincoln. He reprised the role on TV in ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" (1950) and again in ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films. I remember him best for his over the top portrayal of John Brown in ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940). Prior to playing Lincoln, most of his roles were villainous (e.g., Citizen Chauvelin in ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", Black Michael in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", Prince Ghul in ""The Drum"").The great Robert Newton (1905-56) plays Don Pedro. This was his third of what was to become more than 50 films that included ""Henry V"", ""Oliver Twist"" (1948), ""Les Miserables"" (1952) and my personal favorite, ""Treasure Island"" (1950).James Mason has a tiny role in the beginning of the film. When it was re-released in 1944 and Mason had become a star, Korda commissioned a new trailer that stressed Mason's part.Alexander Korda (1893-1956) produced nearly 60 films in his career that started in 1923 in Hungary. His break through film was ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) and there followed a series of historical dramas including ""Rise of Catherine the Great"" (1934), ""Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934) and ""Rembrandt"" (1936), of which ""Fire Over England"" is a lesser example. Korda was known for his cheap production values, which are evident in this film.The film was produced in 1937. It has some suggestions that involvement on the continent is dangerous, as later events would prove.This is a fairly standard historical drama of the 30s and mostly forgettable. It is notable as being the film that David Selznick saw which convinced him that Vivien Leigh could play Scarlett. Far better films from this period about the Elizabethan era include ""Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939) and ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940).",2,First pairing of Olivier and Leigh,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,4485,"['Olivier', 'Leigh', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', '40s', 'Preceded', 'Fairbanks', 'Pickford', 'contemporary', 'Gable', 'Lombard', 'followed', 'Taylor', 'Burton', 'Fire', 'Over', 'England', 'was', 'first', 'pairing', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', '1907-1989', 'future', 'wife', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', '1913-67', 'met', '1935', 'began', 'affair', 'film', 'made', 'several', 'films', 'together', 'including', 'Hamilton', 'Woman', '1941', 'toured', 'together', 'many', 'times', 'performances', 'Anthony', 'Cleopatra', 'MacBeth', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'School', 'Scandal', 'divorced', '1960.Leigh', 'best', 'known', 'stunning', 'performances', 'GWTW', '1939', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Blanche', 'DuBois', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '1951', 'won', 'Oscar', 'times', 'Eventually', 'physical', 'problems', 'miscarriage', 'difficulty', 'living', 'Olivier', 'would', 'take', 'toll', 'began', 'slow', 'descent', 'madness', 'perhaps', 'precipitated', '326', 'performances', 'DuBois', 'stage', 'London', 'followed', 'months', 'filming', 'movie', 'Between', '1955', '1965', 'made', 'only', '1', 'film', 'carried', 'theatre', 'work', 'even', 'won', 'Tony', '1963', 'last', 'film', 'appearance', 'was', '1965', 'Ship', 'Fools', '.Olivier', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '10', 'times', '1939', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', '1978', 'Boys', 'Brazil', 'won', '1949', 'Hamlet', 'appeared', '80+', 'films', 'usually', 'Englishman', 'films', 'based', 'England', 'prime', 'period', 'had', 'been', '40s', 'made', 'few', 'films', '50s', 'probably', 'personal', 'problems', 'was', 'having', 'as', '14', 'AFI', 'list', 'Top', '50', 'Screen', 'Legends.Flora', 'Robson', '1902-84', 'appeared', 'more', '50', 'films', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Saratoga', 'Trunk', '1945', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'film', 'reprised', 'role', 'Sea', 'Hawk', '1940', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'film', 'Many', 'people', 'believe', 'definitive', 'Elizabeth', 'preference', 'would', 'be', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Essex', 'Elizabeth', '1939', 'Other', 'actresses', 'who', ""'ve"", 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'include', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', '1971', 'Helen', 'Mirren', '2005', 'Sarah', 'Bernhardt', '1912', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', '1998', '2007', 'Actresses', 'who', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'twice', 'include', 'Robson', 'Bette', 'Davis', '1938', '1955', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', '1998', '2007', '.BTW', 'Robson', 'was', 'only', '35', 'when', 'appeared', 'film', 'comparison', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'was', '30', 'when', 'first', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blancehtt', 'was', '29', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'mid', '50s.Raymond', 'Massey', '1896-1983', 'King', 'Philip', 'Spain', 'best', 'remembered', 'roles', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Illinois', '1940', 'date', 'best', 'ever', 'portrayal', 'Lincoln', 'reprised', 'role', 'TV', 'Day', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'Shot', '1950', 'again', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', '1962', 'TV', 'played', 'Dr.', 'Gillespie', 'series', 'Dr', 'Kildare', '1961-5', 'made', 'nearly', '100', 'films', 'remember', 'best', 'top', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Brown', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'Trail', '1940', 'Prior', 'playing', 'Lincoln', 'most', 'roles', 'were', 'villainous', 'e.g.', 'Citizen', 'Chauvelin', 'Scarlet', 'Pimpernel', 'Black', 'Michael', 'Prisoner', 'Zenda', 'Prince', 'Ghul', 'Drum', 'great', 'Robert', 'Newton', '1905-56', 'Don', 'Pedro', 'was', 'third', 'what', 'was', 'become', 'more', '50', 'films', 'included', 'Henry', 'V', 'Oliver', 'Twist', '1948', 'Les', 'Miserables', '1952', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Treasure', 'Island', '1950', 'Mason', 'tiny', 'role', 'beginning', 'film', 'When', 'was', 're-released', '1944', 'Mason', 'had', 'become', 'star', 'Korda', 'commissioned', 'new', 'trailer', 'stressed', 'Mason', 'part.Alexander', 'Korda', '1893-1956', 'produced', 'nearly', '60', 'films', 'career', 'started', '1923', 'Hungary', 'break', 'film', 'was', 'Private', 'Life', 'Henry', 'VIII', '1933', 'followed', 'series', 'historical', 'dramas', 'including', 'Rise', 'Catherine', 'Great', '1934', 'Private', 'Life', 'Don', 'Juan', '1934', 'Scarlet', 'Pimpernel', '1934', 'Rembrandt', '1936', 'Fire', 'Over', 'England', 'lesser', 'example', 'Korda', 'was', 'known', 'cheap', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'evident', 'film.The', 'film', 'was', 'produced', '1937', 'suggestions', 'involvement', 'continent', 'dangerous', 'later', 'events', 'would', 'prove.This', 'fairly', 'standard', 'historical', 'drama', '30s', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'notable', 'being', 'film', 'David', 'Selznick', 'saw', 'convinced', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'could', 'play', 'Scarlett', 'Far', 'better', 'films', 'period', 'Elizabethan', 'era', 'include', 'Private', 'Lives', 'Elizabeth', 'Essex', '1939', 'Sea', 'Hawk', '1940']",N/A

Filmed and released in 1937 when Britain was divided into two camps, one led by the redoubtable Winston Churchill saw that Nazi Germany was threat to civilization itself and would have none of the poisonous overtures of 'friendship' Hitler was making towards Britain.The other led by Chamberlain aimed to appease and ingratiate itself with the Nazi evil.The writers of this quite splendid movie must have known that was would happen. The very title of this film 'Fire over England' seems prophetic as three years later Nazi planes would literally spread fire , death and suffering across Britain.Words to the effect of fire and torment over England are spoken in the movie.The movie urged the English people to choose the light of goodness and freedom and fight against tyranny and diabolical moral darkness. As England had chosen in 1688 and the splendid victory she had won over the Spanish Armada.Russia was ralled in a similar way before the War by a brilliant epic period piece calledAlexander NevskyThe film features England in 1588 in the run-up to the Spanish Armada's attack on the England. Elizabeth and her advisers Lord Burleigh (played by Morton Selten who adds some gravitas and dignity), and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Leslie Banks). The dashing and swash-buckling young hero Michael Ingolby (Laurence Olivier) is injured when his father's ship is captured by the Spanish and he washes ashore and is nursed back to health by his Spanish captors who he denounces (after a brief romance with his captives daughter, the Spanish signorita Elena (Tamara Desni) before taking a fishing boast back to England where he is reunited with his lady love Cynthia (Vivien Leigh) urges Queen Elizabeth to raise an army and navy to fight Spain. What was a little dampening for me was the sometimes childish behaviour of Olivia and Leighs characters.The ultimate star of the show is Flora Robson who played Elizabeth I with great majesty, flair and splendid wit.She really gave the succeeding generations of actresses who would play Queen Elizabeth in film, a hard task to follow.Michael Ingolby is then sent back into Spain as an agent where he successfully susses out Spain's plans and engages in some sabotageOf course the finest hour of the film is the battle where the Armada is itself destroyed.

The young Laurence Olivier is sent to Spain to uncover the plot against the Queen. Upon his return, he is knighted and charged with leading the troops into battle.

The focus of the drama is not on their romance, however, but on the defeat of the seemingly invincible Spanish Armada.Here, Olivier is sent on an undercover mission to Phillip of Spain (Raymond Massey), after a plot to depose Elizabeth I is discovered, as the traitors appear to have trafficked with Spain on this issue. Olivier masquerades as one of the traitors in an effort to discover more information as to the other plotters. Olivier is ultimately found out but manages to escape, and the Spanish Armada is roundly defeated.Flora Robson is magnificent as Elizabeth I, sounding every bit the Queen, though her looks are plebeian rather than patrician. Olivier is over the top hammy, while Leigh is as delightful as she is beautiful. Raymond Massey is terrific as the fervently Catholic Phillip of Spain. The sea battle in which the Spanish Armada is roundly defeated is, however, strictly Mickey Mouse in terms of production values. Still, this is a moderately entertaining historical drama.",3,THE SINKING OF THE SPANISH ARMADA...,1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,1163,"['historical', 'drama', 'pairs', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'courtiers', 'drawn', 'other', 'reign', 'Elizabeth', 'Flora', 'Robson', 'focus', 'drama', 'not', 'romance', 'however', 'defeat', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'Spanish', 'Armada.Here', 'Olivier', 'sent', 'undercover', 'mission', 'Phillip', 'Spain', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'plot', 'depose', 'Elizabeth', 'discovered', 'traitors', 'appear', 'have', 'trafficked', 'Spain', 'issue', 'Olivier', 'one', 'traitors', 'effort', 'discover', 'more', 'information', 'other', 'plotters', 'Olivier', 'ultimately', 'found', 'out', 'escape', 'Spanish', 'Armada', 'roundly', 'defeated.Flora', 'Robson', 'magnificent', 'Elizabeth', 'sounding', 'bit', 'Queen', 'looks', 'are', 'plebeian', 'rather', 'patrician', 'Olivier', 'top', 'hammy', 'Leigh', 'as', 'delightful', 'beautiful', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'terrific', 'fervently', 'Catholic', 'Phillip', 'Spain', 'sea', 'battle', 'Spanish', 'Armada', 'roundly', 'defeated', 'however', 'strictly', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'terms', 'production', 'values', 'Still', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'historical', 'drama']",N/A
24276,A3KB1H0S7T6JX1,0780020618,L Gontzes,"[10, 11]","Definitely a wonderful movie, Fire over England, brings to the screen the story of a young English naval officer as he strives to uncover a plot, find the conspirators and warn the Queen of the imminent threat of foreign invasion.The setting is 1558 England.  King Philip of Spain has collected enough gold from the colonies in the Americas that he has built the Spanish Armada.  In addition he has set up a network of spies and operatives in Queen Elizabeth's court who serve as his eyes and ears in England.The clash between England and Spain is as fascinating as the conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism, and both are presented very well in the film.Needless to say, the Hollywood heavyweights Vivien Leigh and Lawrence Olivier as well as the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!The only setback is that Fire over England is a 1937 film and compared to modern films, or even epics of the time such as Gone with the Wind, falls short of being a masterpiece.Nevertheless, the film combines drama, action, and romance, making it one of the best of its kind.The setting, the dialogues, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!History, Intrigue, Duty, Love, Passion, and Honor, are all about.It is a movie worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History!",4,A movie worth watching!,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,1360,"['Definitely', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Fire', 'England', 'screen', 'story', 'young', 'English', 'naval', 'officer', 'uncover', 'plot', 'find', 'conspirators', 'warn', 'Queen', 'imminent', 'threat', 'foreign', 'invasion.The', 'setting', '1558', 'England', 'King', 'Philip', 'Spain', 'collected', 'enough', 'gold', 'colonies', 'Americas', 'built', 'Spanish', 'Armada', 'addition', 'set', 'up', 'network', 'spies', 'operatives', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'court', 'who', 'serve', 'eyes', 'ears', 'England.The', 'clash', 'England', 'Spain', 'as', 'fascinating', 'conflict', 'Protestantism', 'Catholicism', 'are', 'presented', 'very', 'well', 'film.Needless', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'heavyweights', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'truly', 'outdone', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'only', 'setback', 'Fire', 'England', '1937', 'film', 'compared', 'modern', 'films', 'even', 'epics', 'time', 'such', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'short', 'being', 'masterpiece.Nevertheless', 'film', 'combines', 'drama', 'action', 'romance', 'making', 'one', 'best', 'kind.The', 'setting', 'dialogues', 'music', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'History', 'Intrigue', 'Duty', 'Love', 'Passion', 'Honor', 'are', 'about.It', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'soft', 'spot', 'History']",N/A

Laurence Olivier is here, looking very young (well it is 1936!) and Dame Flora Robson is an excellent Queen Elizabeth the 1st. It's hard to say who was the better queen, Flora Robson or Bette Davis; they were both eminently watchable in the role in my opinion.The film was really propaganda about the rising threat of the Nazis: The 'Spanish' were meant to be the Germans, and the 'Armada' was about the threat of invasion from Germany. This aside, the film is still a good rollicking romp forgetting the propaganda issue.So, a very pleasant hour and a half all told.",4,Not a bad film at all!,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,657,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'quite', 'lot', 'even', ""n't"", 'great', 'deal', 'way', 'plot', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'here', 'looking', 'very', 'young', '1936', 'Dame', 'Flora', 'Robson', 'excellent', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', '1st', 'hard', 'say', 'who', 'was', 'better', 'queen', 'Flora', 'Robson', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'were', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'role', 'opinion.The', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'propaganda', 'rising', 'threat', 'Nazis', ""'Spanish"", 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'Germans', ""'Armada"", 'was', 'threat', 'invasion', 'Germany', 'aside', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'rollicking', 'romp', 'forgetting', 'propaganda', 'issue.So', 'very', 'pleasant', 'hour', 'half', 'told']",N/A
