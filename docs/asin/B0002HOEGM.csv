833563,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0002HOEGM,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[18, 19]","""Six: The Mark Unleashed"" is a well paced end-times drama that though a low-budget production, will be highly entertaining for anyone who likes apocalyptic scenarios, and listening to a script that contains a lot of Scripture, though some non-Christians may even find it boring and not appreciate its message. The sets are minimal, as much of the film takes place within the confines of a prison, and the emphasis is on the character development of the people in the story. Those who have received the ""Holy Implant"" have chosen self-preservation at any cost, with life but no freedom, and those who remain true to their Christian beliefs and don't get ""branded,"" accept martyrdom (by guillotine) as a better alternative. There are also those who are simply ""underground,"" having not committed to Christianity, but fearing the implant. The implant is a reprogramming device that makes one conform to obey the Antichrist, during the years of Tribulation.The film is overall very well acted, with producer/director Kevin Downes as Jerry, who is a car thief along with his buddy Brody, played by writer/producer David White. Also in the cast is Stephen Baldwin as Luke, and very impressive are Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Tom, and Troy Winbush as Lewis. The filmmakers made the most of every dollar they spent on this film, and gave their audience a fairly literate script, and an excellent cast. ""Six: The Mark Unleashed"" makes one think about the choices we make; as one character says at the end, ""I still remember the last free choice I ever made...it was the wrong choice.""",4,"""You Can Be Fearless""",1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,1570,"['Six', 'Mark', 'Unleashed', 'well', 'paced', 'end-times', 'drama', 'low-budget', 'production', 'will', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'anyone', 'who', 'apocalyptic', 'scenarios', 'listening', 'script', 'lot', 'Scripture', 'non-Christians', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'boring', 'not', 'appreciate', 'message', 'sets', 'are', 'minimal', 'much', 'film', 'place', 'confines', 'prison', 'emphasis', 'character', 'development', 'people', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'received', 'Holy', 'Implant', 'have', 'chosen', 'self-preservation', 'cost', 'life', 'freedom', 'who', 'remain', 'true', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'branded', 'accept', 'martyrdom', 'guillotine', 'better', 'alternative', 'are', 'also', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'underground', 'having', 'not', 'committed', 'Christianity', 'fearing', 'implant', 'implant', 'reprogramming', 'device', 'one', 'conform', 'obey', 'Antichrist', 'years', 'Tribulation.The', 'film', 'overall', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'producer/director', 'Kevin', 'Downes', 'Jerry', 'who', 'car', 'thief', 'buddy', 'Brody', 'played', 'writer/producer', 'David', 'White', 'Also', 'cast', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Luke', 'very', 'impressive', 'are', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'Tom', 'Troy', 'Winbush', 'Lewis', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'most', 'dollar', 'spent', 'film', 'gave', 'audience', 'fairly', 'literate', 'script', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Six', 'Mark', 'Unleashed', 'one', 'think', 'choices', 'make', 'one', 'character', 'end', 'still', 'remember', 'last', 'free', 'choice', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'wrong', 'choice']",N/A

833569,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0002HOEGM,David Bower,"[1, 1]","There is one fact that dominates my life and that is my love for the Lord Jesus Christ. There is a far secondary fact that has characterized my life for over 70 years and that is a deep affection for science fiction. I have a very extensive collection of science fiction books and a rather large collection of science fiction movies although as to the comparative quality of the two the books are far superior to the movies.In addition I am a devoted student of the Bible and especially the area of end time's prophecy. This movie attempts, on a rather modest budget, to capture the pathos and drama which those left behind will be forced to endure. There is no way this movie can be classified as science fiction; although some science may be involved in monitoring the mark, the other key points of the movie are essentially supernatural in their scope. The fact of the matter is at some future time all of the key points the movie is trying to make will be living reality and you can take that to the bank.Whereas at this point in time the supernatural is suppressed by the power of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit's restraining influence is going to be removed when the church is removed from the earth and after that things are going to change quickly for the much, much worse.A key message from the movie is that salvation in the name of Jesus will still be available to those who have been left behind when the church is removed at the Rapture. That is the good news; the bad news is that life for those securing a place in God's eternal family during that period of time known as ""The Tribulation"" will be extraordinarily difficult often resulting in death. I was a little disappointed by the amount of time spent showing the suffering of those captured by the forces of the Antichrist. It seems as if the message of suffering could have been communicated to the viewer with less ""eyes on suffering"" time.The other good news is this time of suffering and testing will be limited to 7 years and the time of great suffering will be limited to the last three and one half years of the seven year period. This period will be brought to a close by the return of mankind's kinsman-redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ as He returns as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords which happy event is beyond the scope of this movie but is clearly described in the Book of Revelation.I recommend the movie with minor reservations concerning somewhat excessive displays of torture and beheading.

We meet believers and unbelievers confronted with choices of life and death--death by guillotine line, something true to Revelation speaking of Christian beheadings, and a scene that reminded me of the Holocaust scenes of prisoners hung as a group in a line.  Actual decapitation is not shown, and the movie is suitable for young teens and up.Several of these actors also appeared in the movie The Moment After, which I recommend even more highly.  Once again, though, actor Troy Winbush's screen time ends much too soon.  Stephen Baldwin's delivers a subtle, convincing performance as a Spirit-filled prison pastor soon to be executed.The story's rather simple, but a reminder to stand firm in the faith, that losing one's soul is worse than death.  There is a good bit of scripture quoting, some while reading from prison cell walls entirely covered with Bible verses, something that at first required me to suspend my disbelief that this would be allowed.  But then I remembered the writings from the Roman catacombs and cell of Bonhoeffer, and considered that the power of scripture might be unapprreciated by the future authorities, so perhaps it could happen.

833577,A1V7RL4ODXXWDM,B0002HOEGM,"Jennifer Bogart ""@ Quiverfullfamily.com""","[9, 11]","I've watched my fair-share of Christian B-level films about the end-times. Take the Anti-Christ, Christian persecution, imprisonment, and escape plots, mix it all together with a few optional elements, and there you have it. Still, hope springs eternal, so when I saw a DVD with the Sony label attached to it, I was willing to spend 106 minutes in a quasi-futuristic world. Unfortunately after watching Six: The Mark Unleashed my quest to find an end-times film worthy of investing my time or money on continues.Originally released in 2004, this year's re-release of the direct-to-DVD film features a new cover design and an affiliation with Sony Pictures. Combined with the names of some instantly recognizable actors - Stephen Baldwin and Jeffrey Dean Morgan first among them - The Mark Unleashed offered a ray of hope amongst the generally lack-luster DVD offerings available in the Christian marketplace.Opening with an interesting premise - the Leader has taken over the world, requiring his minions to be implanted with a device that prolongs life, diminishes conscience, acts as birth control, and otherwise controls their emotions and behaviour. Free-thinkers, and Christians are amongst those refusing to receive the implant (the mark), and it is two rebels working as car thieves and a black-market smuggler that the film revolves around.Finding themselves imprisoned the trio comes into contact with a large group of Christian inmates awaiting execution upon refusing to take the mark. Amongst these is Stephen Baldwin, the de facto leader of this prison church, where - surprisingly - inmates are allowed Bibles and freedom to gather and worship. Together the three plan their escape from confinement in a search to find Eli Cohen, a man well known for his efforts in preaching salvation to the remaining rebels.Sadly any potential inherent in the screenplay and cast is largely mitigated by directorial and budget constraints. Decent lines are thrown away with lack of dramatic emphasis and timing issues. The plot becomes scattered and unfocused with loose threads and senseless inclusions in the films latter half.Baldwin's character - the most prominent Christian in the film - is entirely too creepy. He seemingly knows everything due to his personal time with God, speaks in an otherworldly monotone meant to convey peace and serenity, but comes across as eerie, and can seem smug as he reveals his personal prophesies. He's the uber-Christian, never getting mad, frustrated, acting uncertain, or dealing with any doubts, insecurities or struggles - making him more of an automaton than a real man.Though listed as ""Not Rated"", I'd assign Six: The Mark Unleashed a PG-13 rating. Though poorly executed, the scenes of neurological torture and the occasional shooting (think people throwing themselves awkwardly to the ground with no blood) would be disturbing for younger viewers. Standard scene navigation is included on the disc, as well as a director's commentary, behind the scenes, bloopers reel, deleted scenes and previews that are available as special features.As a believer I share the evangelical heart of the makers of the film. Most of the actors are also clearly Christian, which is appreciated in a faith-based film. Still, I long for a day to arrive when sub-standard films are no longer hailed as brilliant within the Christian community.",2,"Interesting premise, disappointing delivery",1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,3371,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'fair-share', 'Christian', 'B-level', 'films', 'end-times', 'Take', 'Anti-Christ', 'Christian', 'persecution', 'imprisonment', 'escape', 'plots', 'mix', 'together', 'few', 'optional', 'elements', 'there', 'have', 'Still', 'hope', 'springs', 'eternal', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'Sony', 'label', 'attached', 'was', 'willing', 'spend', '106', 'minutes', 'quasi-futuristic', 'world', 'Unfortunately', 'watching', 'Six', 'Mark', 'Unleashed', 'quest', 'find', 'end-times', 'film', 'worthy', 'investing', 'time', 'money', 'continues.Originally', 'released', '2004', 'year', 're-release', 'direct-to-DVD', 'film', 'new', 'cover', 'design', 'affiliation', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Combined', 'names', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'first', 'Mark', 'Unleashed', 'offered', 'ray', 'hope', 'generally', 'lack-luster', 'DVD', 'offerings', 'available', 'Christian', 'marketplace.Opening', 'interesting', 'premise', 'Leader', 'taken', 'world', 'requiring', 'minions', 'be', 'implanted', 'device', 'life', 'diminishes', 'conscience', 'birth', 'control', 'otherwise', 'controls', 'emotions', 'behaviour', 'Free-thinkers', 'Christians', 'are', 'refusing', 'receive', 'implant', 'mark', 'two', 'rebels', 'working', 'car', 'thieves', 'black-market', 'smuggler', 'film', 'around.Finding', 'imprisoned', 'trio', 'contact', 'large', 'group', 'Christian', 'awaiting', 'execution', 'refusing', 'take', 'mark', 'Amongst', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'de', 'facto', 'leader', 'prison', 'church', 'where', 'surprisingly', 'inmates', 'are', 'allowed', 'Bibles', 'freedom', 'gather', 'worship', 'Together', 'three', 'plan', 'escape', 'confinement', 'search', 'find', 'Eli', 'Cohen', 'man', 'well', 'known', 'efforts', 'preaching', 'salvation', 'remaining', 'rebels.Sadly', 'potential', 'inherent', 'screenplay', 'cast', 'largely', 'mitigated', 'directorial', 'budget', 'constraints', 'Decent', 'lines', 'are', 'thrown', 'away', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'emphasis', 'timing', 'issues', 'plot', 'scattered', 'unfocused', 'loose', 'threads', 'senseless', 'inclusions', 'films', 'latter', 'half.Baldwin', 'character', 'most', 'prominent', 'Christian', 'film', 'entirely', 'too', 'creepy', 'seemingly', 'everything', 'due', 'personal', 'time', 'God', 'otherworldly', 'monotone', 'meant', 'convey', 'peace', 'serenity', 'across', 'eerie', 'can', 'seem', 'smug', 'personal', 'prophesies', 'uber-Christian', 'never', 'getting', 'mad', 'frustrated', 'acting', 'uncertain', 'dealing', 'doubts', 'insecurities', 'making', 'more', 'automaton', 'real', 'man.Though', 'listed', 'Not', 'Rated', ""'d"", 'assign', 'Six', 'Mark', 'Unleashed', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'poorly', 'executed', 'scenes', 'neurological', 'torture', 'occasional', 'shooting', 'think', 'people', 'throwing', 'awkwardly', 'ground', 'blood', 'would', 'be', 'disturbing', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Standard', 'scene', 'navigation', 'included', 'disc', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'previews', 'are', 'available', 'special', 'features.As', 'believer', 'share', 'evangelical', 'heart', 'makers', 'film', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'clearly', 'Christian', 'appreciated', 'faith-based', 'film', 'Still', 'long', 'day', 'arrive', 'when', 'sub-standard', 'films', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'hailed', 'brilliant', 'Christian', 'community']",N/A

Six is an end-times movie - the world has fallen under the power of the anti-Christ and human free will and choice has been destroyed. It kind of reminded me of a Christian version of the movie Equilibrium (which I also highly recommend). The characters in Six are not cardboard cut-outs but well thought out individuals. The emphasis in Six is on human choice - we each have to choose for ourselves to accept or reject Jesus as the Savior. The consequences for each choice are clear - death on earth and eternal life with Jesus or death on earth and death forever in hell. But Six is careful to show that this decision is not a simple choice but involves real pain. One of the characters has lost everything - his job, his freedom, and the woman he loved. To him, God is as responsible for his losses as the anti-Christ is. So, because he can't overcome his pain and bitterness, he doesn't want to hear the message of salvation. My favorite part of the movie (without giving away any spoilers!) is the prison cells. When the Christians are sent to prison for refusing to accept the anti-Christ, they cover the cell walls with Bible verses. Their hope in death mystifies the nonbelieving prisoners and draws them to the message on the walls. This was a small but meaningful touch to the movie. It shows the love that the director and other crew members put into Six. Also, I was so excited to see Stephen Baldwin, one of the famous Baldwin brothers, in a cameo role. Stephen became a Christian after the attacks on September 11th and is such an enthusiatic believer that he can't help but inspire. I would highly recommend renting or buying the DVD version of Six for the special features. There is a 40-minute behind the scenes featurette that is made with almost the same amount of love as Six itself. It includes the struggles the production went through as well as a hilarious story about David White (one of the stars) and a ""driving"" incident. This feature really gives you a window into the love these crew members have for Jesus. Bonus - there is a blooper reel! Adding a blooper reel is always a fun way to see the true character of the actors. Six is a great movie about the very real choice we all must make and where that choice leads us.

I can't say that Six falls into that category.I was taken in by all the positive reviews here and purchased the movie for my church library. Once I previewed it, I was totally disappointed.

Creating a quality end-times thriller on film, using a limited budget is such a tall order, success might be the ultimate proof that God exists!  Six's task was all the more difficult, in that many have tried before:  Left Behind, Omega Code, and the Apocalypse series come to mind.  Yet, in spite of the competition, and difficulties, SIX does a credible job of portraying a world in which an entire society has been caught up in a personality cult.  Three forces collide--the Community--those who buy into the new Messiah's message, and the government line that opponents are dangerous; Renegades--those that are just to independent to buy in or fit in; and finally, Christians--those convinced that the Community signals the end times, and who encourage allegiance to Jesus Christ.Some have, with justification, complained about poor quality action scenes.  Yet, the resignation with which runners run and chasers chase seems almost realistic.  The Community is all-powerful--who can fight Goliath?  And, for Christians, they know that time is coming to an end--why struggle?  Those caught in the middle don't want to submit, but really have nowhere to go.The dialogue can be preachy at times, but the atmosphere, tone, and nuanced environment generated by background music and surprisingly strong acting, make the conversations seem more like musings than rantings.Finally, about characters:  The protaganist plays the man in the middle, independent, torn, frustrated, dejected, yet defiant--perfectly.  His sold-out wife in interesting, mostly for how much she looks like one of the main heroines in the Matrix movies.  It's clever, how she tries to seduce her own husband, grant him hope, yet that she never strays from her new found faith in the Community.  Several other actors play secondary roles with surprising skill.Bottom-line:  This movie will grow on you!  It's not fast-paced, but it does not drag either.

It's never mentioned in the film, either for good or bad. People may say that it's proof that the Rapture teaching is wrong, but that's faulty thinking coming from the fact that the Rapture teaching just isn't mentioned. Then again, it really isn't central to the story's theme and plot, as it concentrates on three men who are put into prison and forced to make a decision on who and what to believe in that could determine their eternal destiny while attempting to make a prison break. The fact that one of the prisoners is in love with somebody who became an agent for the Community (those who have taken the so-called Holy Implant) complicates things. Anyway, probably the most unrealistic thing about this film is that the Leader of this Community would ever allow Bible studies and verses upon the walls of the prison, as most end-times Bible students would believe that the Antichrist would be so anti-God and anti-Jesus that such things wouldn't be allowed.
