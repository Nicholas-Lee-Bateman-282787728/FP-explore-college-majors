It is pure comedy with very little depth but good performances all round within the limits of the genre.Down and out in Beverly Hills was a disappointment.  There are several comedy moments but it can't work out whether it wants to be slapstick or social satire and ends up being neither.  Not something I would want to put on again.As usual the film arrived well inside the estimated time.",3,Two films - two answers,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,475,"['Ruthless', 'People', 'something', 'favourite', 'mine', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'pure', 'comedy', 'very', 'little', 'depth', 'good', 'performances', 'round', 'limits', 'genre.Down', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'was', 'disappointment', 'are', 'several', 'comedy', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'be', 'slapstick', 'social', 'satire', 'up', 'being', 'Not', 'something', 'would', 'want', 'put', 'again.As', 'usual', 'film', 'arrived', 'well', 'estimated', 'time']",Ruthless People / Down and Out in Beverly Hills
