1596059,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B009EU6F1U,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 3]","Not too many movies around that have this kind of exuberance. This moves like a freight train but you might not want to get out of the way.Here's the scoop. Yul Perkins (writer/director Dax Shepard) is in the witness protection program with Tom Arnold as his protector. His girlfriend Annie Bean (Kristen Bell) has received a once in a lifetime job offer in Los Angeles. Does Yul break cover for the girl he loves, and if he does, what are the consequences?I found this entirely engaging. The set up is pretty basic, but, as in any good plot, the details are doled out slowly so the picture becomes more subtle and involved as things progress. Yul is a cool character. He is truly trying to turn his life around and his girl Annie is a big part of that. They have some very witty, Tarantino-esque conversations. They feel good together. The other characters are written well also. Brad Cooper, as Alex Dimitri, is a real card. Too many movies write their villains as shallow, and/or stupid tough guys. He's anything but. His dog food scene alone is worth the price of admission. About the weakest link here is Tom Arnold.  I like Tom Arnold. He plays a good second banana, but he is simply too inept to be a Federal Marshall. This is a crazy bunch of people with their own back stories, but the way all the factions come together is really cool and unexpected. Yes there's tension but these folks aren't just shooting at each other and threatening each other. They're having these really great conversations. The car chase scenes are directed really well. Car chases are such old news, it's always good to see some that rise above the fray.This is a way fun movie. It's tense, funny, clever, well acted and well directed. Is it great art? No. But it delivers, in spades, what it sets out to deliver.",4,Incoming!!!

Everyone in this goofy thing sounds as though he or she is a college-educated sociologist with a bit of new-age jargon thrown in. It was nice to hear, but I had to wonder if that was the intention of screenwriter Dax Shepard (""Brother's Justice"") or if he lacks the skill to write more varied and authentic dialogue.This is a high-octane road race between a wide variety of muscle cars, custom-built race cars and one sturdy SUV, all because a former getaway driver (for bank robbers) who is in the Witness Protection Program, has promised to drive his sweetheart to a job interview 600 miles away, and nothing, not her ex-boyfriend, not his former gang members, not his dad, not a U.S. Marshall, nor his girlfriend's change of heart, can stop him.We see:* Kristen Bell (""Big Miracle"") specializes in conflict resolution. She has a great job opportunity IF she can get to her Los Angeles interview in time. She thinks her boyfriend witnessed a crime.* Dax Shepard (""When in Rome"") admitted to his girlfriend he was in the Witness Protection Program, but he failed to mention that he was an accomplice in those crimes.* Bradley Cooper (""Limitless"") spent some painful time in jail because our hero ratted him out. Now he's mad! (But he loves dogs and doesn't want to see them fed inferior dog food.)* Joy Bryant (""Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins""), our hero's former girlfriend, is part of that bank-robbing gang, AND she's a pretty fair shot!* Beau Bridges (""The Descendants"") is our hero's father.

1596080,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B009EU6F1U,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.In the world of film it's becoming increasingly apparent that a movie's title can make or break its success. You have the pop culture flicks like Transformers and Fast and Furious, the books-turned-movie franchises like Harry Potter and Twilight, everything else in between, and then you have Hit & Run. At first glance, nothing about the film is appealing: the title, the cover, the fact that Bradley Cooper is sporting dreadlocks. From the gate it already has so much going against it. So why was it so good? How is it possible that this film - which seemed destined to be a train wreck - managed to give me one of the funnest cinematic experiences I've had in months?Well, to be honest, there's multiple reasons. There's the honest chemistry between the two leads, the carefree script, and the overall fun nature of the film. There was never a point in Hit & Run where I went, ""Ok, this is a bit much."" In other words, I never felt overwhelmed. You have the action-oriented side of the film and then you have the comedic side. What Dax Shepard did extremely well was find that balance between the two. It never felt like he favored one of these elements over the other and it always felt genuine. Hell, he was even able to throw in a bit of romance and social commentary for good measure. I mean, why not right?Hit & Run follows the life of Charlie Bronson (Shepard), a man who was put into witness protection four years ago. He's currently living in Milton, California with his girlfriend Annie Bean (Kristen Bell), a professor at a local college. As we all know, you can't leave your area once you're put into witness protection. Unfortunately, Annie recently got offered an interview at the University of California for a job in the field she created herself. While hesitant at first, Charlie decides that she should go and that he would go with her. Things quickly get out of hand as Charlie and Annie are chased by Charlie's supervisor Randy (Tom Arnold), Annie's ex-boyfriend Gil (Michael Rosenbaum), and Charlie's ex-friend Alex (Cooper). All she wanted to do was go to her interview!What surprised me most was all the social commentary scattered throughout the film. Whether it was society's insensitiveness towards certain words like ""f**"", how we constantly stereotype people, or our constant impulse to judge someone because of their past instead of looking at who they are now; I mean, they covered it all. What made it better was the fact that it all felt natural. It didn't feel like they threw it in at the last second because they wanted to make the movie seem more appealing to a greater audience. Everything seemed to work perfectly and nothing felt out of place. Major props to Shepard for that.Also, the on-screen relationship between Charlie and Annie was very well written. While at times I felt Annie was being a bit annoying, especially when she found out the truth about Charlie, I loved that Charlie never got out of hand. He called her out on her being judgmental just like she called him out on being insensitive. Not only that, but the fact that Shepard and Bell are in a relationship in real life translates really well on screen. It helps breathe a certain purity to the characters' relationship which is something you don't see often. They're completely comfortable with each other which allows their relationship to feel authentic.Finally, the casting in the film is extremely well done. Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are great together and part of that has to do with their relationship in real life. Then you have Tom Arnold who was a riot in almost every scene he was in. Similarly, Bradley Cooper gave another great performance as Alex. I don't know what it is about him, but he seems to nail every performance he takes on. As the film reaches it's final twenty minutes or so you're greeted with a few familiar faces. Beau Bridges appears as Charlie's dad, Jason Bateman appears as a U.S. Marshal, and Sean Hayes appears as Sandy Osterman, the professor who interviews Annie. It's always nice to see Bateman in a film and I can't even remember the last time I saw Sean Hayes in something.Overall Score: 8/10 - I must admit that I was not expecting to like this film as much as I did. It's smart, it's funny, and it's a fun ride from start to finish. It's one of those movies that doesn't try to achieve some big goal. It's there to entertain and that's exactly what it did. It does that all while giving you some great social commentary and a nice cast. Overall, Hit & Run is a very well-rounded movie that exceeded my expectations. Definitely recommend you check this out if you have the time.",4,8/10 - Good,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,4682,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.In', 'world', 'film', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'apparent', 'movie', 'title', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'success', 'have', 'pop', 'culture', 'flicks', 'Transformers', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'books-turned-movie', 'franchises', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Twilight', 'everything', 'else', 'then', 'have', 'Hit', 'Run', 'first', 'glance', 'nothing', 'film', 'appealing', 'title', 'cover', 'fact', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'sporting', 'dreadlocks', 'gate', 'already', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'So', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'How', 'possible', 'film', 'seemed', 'destined', 'be', 'train', 'wreck', 'managed', 'give', 'one', 'funnest', 'cinematic', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'months', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'honest', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'carefree', 'script', 'overall', 'fun', 'nature', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'point', 'Hit', 'Run', 'where', 'went', 'Ok', 'bit', 'much', 'other', 'words', 'never', 'felt', 'overwhelmed', 'have', 'action-oriented', 'side', 'film', 'then', 'have', 'comedic', 'side', 'What', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'did', 'extremely', 'well', 'was', 'find', 'balance', 'two', 'never', 'felt', 'favored', 'one', 'elements', 'other', 'always', 'felt', 'genuine', 'Hell', 'was', 'even', 'able', 'throw', 'bit', 'romance', 'social', 'commentary', 'good', 'measure', 'mean', 'why', 'not', 'right', 'Hit', 'Run', 'life', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'Shepard', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'put', 'witness', 'protection', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'currently', 'living', 'Milton', 'California', 'girlfriend', 'Annie', 'Bean', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'professor', 'local', 'college', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'area', 'once', ""'re"", 'put', 'witness', 'protection', 'Unfortunately', 'Annie', 'recently', 'got', 'offered', 'interview', 'University', 'California', 'job', 'field', 'created', 'hesitant', 'first', 'Charlie', 'should', 'go', 'would', 'go', 'Things', 'quickly', 'get', 'hand', 'Charlie', 'Annie', 'are', 'chased', 'Charlie', 'supervisor', 'Randy', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'Annie', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Gil', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Charlie', 'ex-friend', 'Alex', 'Cooper', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'go', 'interview', 'What', 'surprised', 'most', 'was', 'social', 'commentary', 'scattered', 'film', 'was', 'society', 'insensitiveness', 'towards', 'certain', 'words', 'f**', 'how', 'constantly', 'stereotype', 'people', 'constant', 'impulse', 'judge', 'someone', 'past', 'instead', 'looking', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'mean', 'covered', 'What', 'made', 'better', 'was', 'fact', 'felt', 'natural', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'threw', 'last', 'second', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'more', 'appealing', 'greater', 'audience', 'Everything', 'seemed', 'work', 'perfectly', 'nothing', 'felt', 'place', 'Major', 'props', 'Shepard', 'that.Also', 'on-screen', 'relationship', 'Charlie', 'Annie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'times', 'felt', 'Annie', 'was', 'being', 'bit', 'annoying', 'especially', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'truth', 'Charlie', 'loved', 'Charlie', 'never', 'got', 'hand', 'called', 'out', 'being', 'judgmental', 'just', 'called', 'out', 'being', 'insensitive', 'Not', 'only', 'fact', 'Shepard', 'Bell', 'are', 'relationship', 'real', 'life', 'translates', 'really', 'well', 'screen', 'breathe', 'certain', 'purity', 'characters', 'relationship', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', ""'re"", 'completely', 'comfortable', 'other', 'relationship', 'feel', 'authentic.Finally', 'casting', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'part', 'do', 'relationship', 'real', 'life', 'Then', 'have', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'who', 'was', 'riot', 'almost', 'scene', 'was', 'Similarly', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'Alex', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'nail', 'performance', 'film', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', ""'re"", 'greeted', 'few', 'familiar', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Charlie', 'dad', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'U.S', 'Marshal', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Sandy', 'Osterman', 'professor', 'who', 'Annie', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Bateman', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'something.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'like', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'smart', 'funny', 'fun', 'ride', 'start', 'finish', 'one', 'movies', ""n't"", 'try', 'achieve', 'big', 'goal', 'there', 'entertain', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'giving', 'great', 'social', 'commentary', 'nice', 'cast', 'Overall', 'Hit', 'Run', 'very', 'well-rounded', 'movie', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'Definitely', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'have', 'time']",Hit & Run

Shepard plays Charlie Bronson (nee Yul Perkins) who is in witness protection in a small northern California town.  He does strike gold, however, when he finds a loving relationship with Annie (real life mate Kristen Bell).  She is a professor at the local college but is about to lose her job due to budget cuts.Her boss is played by a hilarious Kristin Chenoweth.  Given Annie's doctorate is in nonviolent conflict resolution (admit it, that's funny) her options are limited.  She finds a possible job in Los Angeles, but that means if she drags Charlie along, he will have to leave his protected status.  Of course he does and that's when the Keystone Kops chase begins.One of his pursuers is an incompetent federal marshal (Tom Arnold) who is also a friend.  Another is Alex (a dreadlocked Bradley Cooper) who was Charlie/Yul's bank robbing partner.  He's accompanied by Yul's former girlfriend played by Joy Bryant who is also Shepard's lover on the TV show ""Parenthood.""  Then there's an old boyfriend (Michael Rosenbaum) of Annie's.  His gay brother is a county deputy sheriff looking for romance.Bell and Shepard are great together as they take time to argue about the use of a disparaging word for homosexuals and whether Charlie's hot rod Lincoln Continental is an appropriate vehicle for the couple.  Besides Chenoweth, Cooper steals most of his scenes especially after he confronts Charlie.  Granted some of the jokes fall flat and some of the bits just seem to be added for length.

1596125,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B009EU6F1U,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","HIT AND RUN is an odd, but oddly entertaining movie.  Not exactly a comedy.  Not a drama.  Not quite an action film.  I guess it could best be summarized as a comedic action romance.Dax Shepard plays Charles Bronson (not the movie star), a former bank robbery getaway driver who is currently in witness protection, currently living in small town California.  He's in a strong relationship with a community college teacher (Kristen Bell) and they seem blissfully happy.  Shepard is friendly with his hapless witness protection marshal (Tom Arnold, less annoying than usual), and other than the fact that Shepard doesn't seem to have an action job...all is well.Things are turned upside down, though, when Bell is a) fired from her current gig and b) given the opportunity to get her dream job at a university in Los Angeles.  Shepard decides he's going to leave his safe environment and follow her to LA...and this triggers a series of unfortunate events culminating in numerous chase scenes, confrontations and misunderstandings.  Eventually, Shepard must confront those whom he betrayed, including his former partner in crime, the Adidas track suit wearing, dreadlocked Bradley Cooper.  Measured chaos ensues.In some ways, this movie wants to be a breezy action comedy, light and fun.  But the script is also heavily focused on its dialogue, so it feels a little bit like a lightweight Tarantino film, with these scruffy characters being FAR TOO articulate.  Or, perhaps, it feels a little like an action film Woody Allen might have written.  And it tries a bit too hard to make Dax Shepard into a romantic figure.  He speaks poetically to Bell...he's Mr. Sensitive.  And the film was co-directed by Shepard...which to me means he didn't understand that he's not always convincing in this role.  There's no reason he can't be convincing as a romantic...but he's often filmed in dewy-eyed close-up.  He almost teeters into parody.  His character is interesting and unusual, but not always convincing.  I guess if I had to sum it up, it appears that Shepard wanted HIT AND RUN to be the vehicle that turned him into a star...and he misses the mark fairly widely.Kristen Bell is pleasant enough, but I didn't feel her character was as well rounded.  And the frequent close-ups on her face, unfortunately, revealed the copious amounts of makeup she was wearing.  I mention this because I'm NEVER aware of this sort of thing...but her character is supposed to be ""Fresh-faced"" and thus, the heavy makeup was a bit jarring.  I admit, this is a really minor quibble...but for some reason, it stood out for me.Cooper, though an unbelievable character in many ways, is perhaps the most purely amusing character.  He's ridiculous and dangerous.  The conception of his character is over-the-top, yet he downplays it and makes it as ""real"" as possible.The movie is peppered with interesting cameos.  Kristen Chenoweth and Sean Hayes come across as bad caricatures.  Jason Bateman appears in a scene for no good reason.  David Koechner pops up.  Beau Bridges actually has a couple of nice moments.There are chase scenes, but in general, they are not anything special.  (Although good laughs are to be had at the expense of Tom Arnold and the mini-van he drives.)  The scenery is lovely.  There are certainly scattered laughs to be had throughout, and the film was never dull.  But it's just too quirky in an uncontrolled way to really work.  I give it a VERY modest recommendation, because it does have a fair amount of imagination and originality.  But it can't quite shake the ""Dax Shepard vanity project"" vibe, and thus is less than satisfying.",3,"Modestly entertaining, but wildly uneven",1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,3635,"['HIT', 'RUN', 'odd', 'oddly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Not', 'exactly', 'comedy', 'Not', 'drama', 'Not', 'quite', 'action', 'film', 'guess', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'summarized', 'comedic', 'action', 'Shepard', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'not', 'movie', 'star', 'former', 'bank', 'robbery', 'getaway', 'driver', 'who', 'currently', 'witness', 'protection', 'currently', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'California', 'strong', 'relationship', 'community', 'college', 'teacher', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'seem', 'blissfully', 'happy', 'Shepard', 'friendly', 'hapless', 'witness', 'protection', 'marshal', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'less', 'annoying', 'usual', 'other', 'fact', 'Shepard', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'action', 'job', 'well.Things', 'are', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'though', 'when', 'Bell', 'fired', 'current', 'gig', 'b', 'given', 'opportunity', 'get', 'dream', 'job', 'university', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Shepard', 'going', 'leave', 'safe', 'environment', 'follow', 'LA', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'culminating', 'numerous', 'chase', 'scenes', 'confrontations', 'misunderstandings', 'Eventually', 'Shepard', 'must', 'confront', 'whom', 'betrayed', 'including', 'former', 'partner', 'crime', 'Adidas', 'track', 'suit', 'wearing', 'dreadlocked', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Measured', 'chaos', 'ensues.In', 'ways', 'movie', 'be', 'breezy', 'action', 'comedy', 'light', 'fun', 'script', 'also', 'heavily', 'focused', 'dialogue', 'little', 'bit', 'lightweight', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'scruffy', 'characters', 'being', 'FAR', 'TOO', 'articulate', 'perhaps', 'little', 'action', 'film', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'might', 'have', 'written', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'romantic', 'figure', 'poetically', 'Bell', 'Mr', 'Sensitive', 'film', 'was', 'co-directed', 'Shepard', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'not', 'always', 'convincing', 'role', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'convincing', 'romantic', 'often', 'filmed', 'dewy-eyed', 'close-up', 'almost', 'teeters', 'parody', 'character', 'interesting', 'unusual', 'not', 'always', 'convincing', 'guess', 'had', 'sum', 'up', 'Shepard', 'wanted', 'HIT', 'AND', 'RUN', 'be', 'vehicle', 'turned', 'star', 'mark', 'fairly', 'widely.Kristen', 'Bell', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'character', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'rounded', 'frequent', 'close-ups', 'face', 'unfortunately', 'revealed', 'copious', 'amounts', 'makeup', 'was', 'wearing', 'mention', ""'m"", 'NEVER', 'aware', 'sort', 'thing', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'Fresh-faced', 'thus', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'was', 'bit', 'jarring', 'admit', 'really', 'minor', 'quibble', 'reason', 'stood', 'out', 'me.Cooper', 'unbelievable', 'character', 'many', 'ways', 'perhaps', 'most', 'purely', 'amusing', 'character', 'ridiculous', 'dangerous', 'conception', 'character', 'over-the-top', 'yet', 'real', 'possible.The', 'movie', 'peppered', 'interesting', 'cameos', 'Kristen', 'Chenoweth', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'come', 'bad', 'caricatures', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'scene', 'good', 'reason', 'David', 'Koechner', 'up', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'actually', 'couple', 'nice', 'moments.There', 'are', 'chase', 'scenes', 'general', 'are', 'not', 'anything', 'special', 'good', 'laughs', 'are', 'be', 'had', 'expense', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'mini-van', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'are', 'certainly', 'scattered', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'dull', 'just', 'too', 'quirky', 'uncontrolled', 'way', 'really', 'work', 'give', 'VERY', 'modest', 'recommendation', 'have', 'fair', 'amount', 'imagination', 'originality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'shake', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'vanity', 'project', 'vibe', 'thus', 'less', 'satisfying']",Hit & Run

""Charles Bronson"" is shocked to hear that Annie, specializing in nonviolent conflict resolution, has a job interview for a department chair position in Los Angeles. But ""Charles Bronson"" - of course, this is not his real name - cannot go to Los Angeles, where he left his troubled past four years ago.Well, in fact the film is nothing serious. Filled with quirky dialogue and eccentric characters, ""Hit and Run"" is an action comedy that leans towards comedy, or comedy of off-the-wall humor. Made on a budget of $2 million (half of which was reportedly spent to secure music rights), the action scenes of ""Hit and Run"" are modest at best.As a comedy, however, this is really a mixed bag. The leading characters are likable, with charming Kristen Bell, but their storyline is predictable and forgettable. The antics are unpredictable and often funny, but random and repetitions. Cars are so cool, and so is the soundtrack music. Oh, and I almost forgot Bradley Cooper.
