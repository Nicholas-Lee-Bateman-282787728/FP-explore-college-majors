Once in the US, he is still obsessed by her, despite her obvious obnoxiousness and indifference to his fate. You feel sorry for him, but at the same time you cannot help thinking he is somewhat ridiculous.The last scene is not very coherent with the reminder of the movie, and to be honnest a bit far-fetched.Aside from Marlon, the other characters are interesting and also well interpreted (Ana de la Reguera is great). Altogether, I had a good time watching this movie, despite some aspects that could have been better.",4,Not a masterpiece but pleasant to watch,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,807,"['movie', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'showing', 'very', 'realistically', 'obstacles', 'immigrants', 'face.Yet', 'main', 'character', 'very', 'weak', 'spineless', 'just', 'longing', 'have', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'undertake', 'journey', 'Colombia', 'US', 'Once', 'US', 'still', 'obsessed', 'obvious', 'obnoxiousness', 'indifference', 'fate', 'feel', 'sorry', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'thinking', 'somewhat', 'ridiculous.The', 'last', 'scene', 'not', 'very', 'coherent', 'reminder', 'movie', 'be', 'honnest', 'bit', 'far-fetched.Aside', 'Marlon', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'also', 'well', 'interpreted', 'Ana', 'de', 'la', 'Reguera', 'great', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'aspects', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",Paraiso Travel

1271379,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B002JHD9BE,Michael A. Newman,"[0, 0]","This is the story of two young lovers, Marlon and Reina who decide to migrate to the United States by going through Guatamala and Mexico from Colombia and then sneak across the border.  They end up in New York in search of Reina's mother and get separated.As the movie opens Marlon storms out of a room after an argument with Reina and gets chased by the police.  After he escapes he realizes he is lost and has no idea how to find Reina.  He ends up going from Brooklyn to Queens (Jackson Heights) where the wife of the owner of a Colombian restaurant takes pity on him.  She finds a place for him to stay and then gets her husband to reluctantly give him a job.All Marlon can think about is finding Reina and the movie switches back and forth between Marlon's struggle and search and flashbacks to how he and Reina left Colombia and went on their grueling trek to dangerous parts of Mexico and ultimately to the dangerous crossing into the United States.The movie is full of many colorful and interesting characters such as John Leguzamo as an S&M; lover, the weird people who occupy the abandoned building that Marlon ends up living in, and the sexy woman that made the crossing with Reina and Marlon, who Marlon later meets up with.Marlon doesn't seem to realize what he has with the people who are very good to him including a budding Colombian singer who loves him.  Instead he continually obsesses over Reina, who is a bitter and corrupt individual.The movie never gets boring and is both poignant and at times humorous.

1271381,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B002JHD9BE,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[6, 7]","I seem to be one of the few fans of Simon Brand's only other filmUnknown, but his follow-up here of tackling an immigration story was powerful, worthwhile and filled with excellently performances. We see the story of two immigrants from Colombia to New York told in a non-lineal format. The two lines of this young couple's trip through South America and resulting residency in New York are bounced back and forth, book-ended with an unusual ambiguity of character outcomes. I liked the style and the resulting quality of moods in each setting, and I really think he makes a competent film with this group of unknowns. The graphic storytelling mixes a spattering of family loss, hatred, love, and finding oneself while trying to survive as an immigrant in the US.The picture quality and sound are done perfectly and the city scapes of NY looked pristine upscaled. I tried the English dubbed version but it was painful and the sound was not mixed well back into the main frame - the 5.1 Spanish was just right. The special features appeared to be thorough, but I could only muddle through the main 50-minute documentary/making-of as there are no subtitles (all in Spanish). A short picture gallery is also included. There are some stark and brutal similarities toSin Nombreas also depicted in this film, but both are worthwhile viewing this quarter.",5,Another triumph for Brand,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,1348,"['seem', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'fans', 'Simon', 'Brand', 'only', 'other', 'filmUnknown', 'follow-up', 'here', 'tackling', 'immigration', 'story', 'was', 'powerful', 'worthwhile', 'filled', 'excellently', 'performances', 'see', 'story', 'two', 'immigrants', 'Colombia', 'New', 'York', 'told', 'non-lineal', 'format', 'two', 'lines', 'young', 'couple', 'trip', 'South', 'America', 'resulting', 'residency', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'bounced', 'back', 'forth', 'book-ended', 'unusual', 'ambiguity', 'character', 'outcomes', 'liked', 'style', 'resulting', 'quality', 'moods', 'setting', 'really', 'think', 'competent', 'film', 'group', 'unknowns', 'graphic', 'storytelling', 'mixes', 'spattering', 'family', 'loss', 'hatred', 'love', 'finding', 'trying', 'survive', 'immigrant', 'US.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'done', 'perfectly', 'city', 'scapes', 'NY', 'looked', 'pristine', 'upscaled', 'tried', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'was', 'painful', 'sound', 'was', 'not', 'mixed', 'well', 'back', 'main', 'frame', '5.1', 'Spanish', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'special', 'features', 'appeared', 'be', 'thorough', 'could', 'only', 'muddle', 'main', '50-minute', 'documentary/making-of', 'are', 'subtitles', 'Spanish', 'short', 'picture', 'gallery', 'also', 'included', 'are', 'stark', 'brutal', 'similarities', 'toSin', 'Nombreas', 'also', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'quarter']",Paraiso Travel
