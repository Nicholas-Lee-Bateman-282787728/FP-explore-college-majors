I watched it on Starz On Demand, and after seeing it, I want to own it. (Since they never show it so i can tape it on DVR, I came to amazon instead, lol).Anywho, the movie is hysterical. I could of done w/o the kinkyness of what the son is into, but i guess that just adds to the storyline of this movie. My fave part and best scene of this movie is when Andy Garcia auditions for the scorcese movie and he gets so into his character and completely loses it on the 2 ladies that are auditioning him. Fave scene, so hilarious.The only other scene i really enjoy is the ending, when everything starts coming full circle. i won't ruin the end for you. that was funny too. I died laughing so many times, i had to rewind back the scene in order to hear what it was about.

The Rizzo family is full of secrets; Vincent Rizzo is a correctional officer who decides to bring his child from another woman home to his family without revealing to them his true identity. His wife (Julianne Margulies) feels that she is in a loveless marriage and tries to hit on Rizzo's son. His daughter who is home for a break has lost her scholarship at college and is working as a stripper to pay for college expenses. His son has a fetish for overweight women and is using his neighbor to entice another girl from his school on whom he has a secret crush.The movie is a hilarious look at these people, their secrets and the ultimate joy of being a family. The acting, writing and the direction are all solid.The ending is highly predictable but the journey there is fun and entertaining because of outstanding performances.

Vinnie, the father, is a corrections officer with aspirations of becoming an actor. But he's embarrassed by his dream, so he tells his wife he's playing poker when he attends his acting classes. His wife, Joyce, suspects that he's having an affair. Their son is exploring porn sites on his computer, while his sister has been kicked out of school and is now working as a stripper.When Vinnie realizes that one of the convicts he's guarding is his son from a relationship he walked away from before he met Joyce, he decides to bring the young man home to give him a second chance. But of course, Vinnie can't bring himself to tell his family the truth about this newcomer. However, Tony's presence shakes the delicate balance of the Rizzo family's existence, and forces everyone to confront the fear that is driving all the lying and deceit.The situations are comically absurd, and the Rizzo family is a total parody of a dysfunctional family, but their struggles provide a number of laughs.

He was gorgeous and sexy in his role as a tough, dangerous Mafia type in that blockbuster film. I thrilled at his love scenes with Sofia Coppola. He was hot!I could not picture my ""find"" being a comic, but this movie opened my eyes to Garcia's versatility. He is hilarious as Vince Rizzo inCity Islandwhere he plays a prison guard (he prefers the title ""correction officer""). He appears to have a normal family life with a beautiful wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies), a mouthy son Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller) and a collegiate daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido). But all is not as it seems...Vince has a big secret that he can't share with his family: he's taking acting classes and is a bit ashamed to admit it because he never shared those aspirations with his family. The fun begins with the hi-jinx he pulls to guard his secret ambition. To further complicate matters his acting partner (Emily Mortimer) urges him on... And, guess what?: She has secrets of her own.And then Vince discovers that one of his inmates (Steven Strait) is his illegitimate son...which is another secret. He arranges to have the young man released in his custody and brings him to live with his family. Which makes matters worse because his son doesn't know Vince is his father and the family is completely in the dark about why this ""con"" is suddenly thrust upon them.And what secrets do members of his family have? Where is his daughter when she's supposed to be in college? What kinky secrets does his young son have? And why does his faithful wife suddenly get a hankering for his illegitimate son when she's always been faithful? Surprisingly, Vince's secret son turns out to be the voice of reason in this movie. How does he save the day?You'll learn the answers to all those questions in this rollicking movie that's filled with warmth and humor. Writer/director Raymond De Felitta has created one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Kudos to him and the entire cast for making this sweet, charming movie so engaging from start to finish.You know that old saying: ""What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive?"" Well, this movies proves the truth in that...in the most delightful way.Highly recommended for the entire family.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, September 12, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books",5,Warm & hilarious!

The movie draws you in from the beginning, and you are just waiting for the whole bubble of lies to burst. The cast is great.

Somebody is smoking a cigarette in almost every scene. I don't know why the director thought that was necessary.

1328916,A2FNA5903D9E6Y,B0036TGT8Y,Carol Toscano,"[2, 6]","To be honest, I was first attracted to this film because I'm from The Bronx, I'm Italian and my dad worked for many many years on City Island (let's see, that would make him a Clam Digger, no? Or is he a Mussel Sucker? Hmmm... Tough one.). The other reason is I'm a big fan of Director Raymond De Felitta, who also directed one of my favorite films - Two Family House. City Island focuses on the dysfunctional family of a corrections officer played by Andy Garcia. The problem I had with all the dysfunction was I wasn't able to identify the root causes of said dysfunction. And there was an overkill of dysfunction so that some superfluous dysfunction took away from really important dysfunction. Let me explain. From the beginning, the main dysfunction is apparent: a man with both a dream and marital strife. But there is also child/parent dysfunction, quirks, secrets, abandonment and anger. One problem: we don't know why - not a lot of back story. Andy Garcia's character wants to be an actor and tells his wife he's gambling so that he can go to an acting class which fuels her animosity toward him. It's not clear how they got to that point (keeping your dreams secret is one thing but choosing a lie that fuels anger seemed off to me). While he's at his corrections job and out at acting class, his wife is getting angrier and angrier, the two kids are coming apart at the seams (daughter flunks out of college and can't tell her own uneducated parents she has a problem with school so she becomes a stripper; son inexplicably subscribes to a chubby chaser's website and gets turned on by watching a morbidly obese woman gorging round the clock). In the meantime, Andy Garcia learns that his ""secret son"" from a previous relationship has been transferred to his jail and arranges to take the inmate home to live with the family - work in exchange for jail time. I found that part of the story a little hard to believe. So now we have the core story line which is the man with a secret dream and his lying and scheming to achieve the dream. Then, we have the disgruntled, angry wife story, daughter as stripper story, son as chubby chaser story, secret son from a previous relationship story and if that's not enough, our main character is developing a relationship with a woman from his acting class and she has a story of her own. It's too much at times and for a film with so much, there are actually some surprisingly slow sections that drag on and on and on.The good news is, if you hang on until the last half hour, you'll be satisfied with the ending (I won't spoil that here). I found some of the stories distracting, particularly the son's chubby chasing activity which was quite a disconnect from the type of background the kid came from. There really were no satisfactory explanations or repercussions regarding that behavior which goes against everything I know about Italian families from The Bronx. And trust me, I know Italian families from The Bronx.Of this film and Two Family House, I'll have to say I prefer Two Family House because there was a heart to that film which carried through and you could feel the trials, tribulations and longings of the main character deeply and profoundly. The themes in Two Family House were more universal and relate-able - themes like honesty, loss and singing your own song even if nobody else sings along (kinda literally). In City Island, there are so many distractions from the main story, there are times when you lose sight of the man with the dream. It comes through in the end but there are moments when he fades into the background and you aren't sure why you're even there.It is through the skill of the actors this film actually pulls through. And thankfully so.",3,Great performances save an otherwise disconnected story line,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,3734,"['be', 'honest', 'was', 'first', 'attracted', 'film', ""'m"", 'Bronx', ""'m"", 'Italian', 'dad', 'worked', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'City', 'Island', 'let', 'see', 'would', 'make', 'Clam', 'Digger', 'Mussel', 'Sucker', 'Hmmm', 'Tough', 'one.', 'other', 'reason', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Director', 'Raymond', 'De', 'Felitta', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Two', 'Family', 'House', 'City', 'Island', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'corrections', 'officer', 'played', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'problem', 'had', 'dysfunction', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'identify', 'root', 'causes', 'said', 'dysfunction', 'was', 'overkill', 'dysfunction', 'superfluous', 'dysfunction', 'took', 'away', 'really', 'important', 'dysfunction', 'Let', 'explain', 'beginning', 'main', 'dysfunction', 'apparent', 'man', 'dream', 'marital', 'strife', 'also', 'child/parent', 'dysfunction', 'quirks', 'secrets', 'abandonment', 'anger', 'One', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'not', 'lot', 'back', 'story', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'character', 'be', 'actor', 'wife', 'gambling', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'acting', 'class', 'animosity', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'got', 'point', 'keeping', 'dreams', 'secret', 'one', 'thing', 'choosing', 'lie', 'fuels', 'anger', 'seemed', 'corrections', 'job', 'out', 'acting', 'class', 'wife', 'getting', 'angrier', 'angrier', 'two', 'kids', 'are', 'coming', 'apart', 'seams', 'daughter', 'flunks', 'college', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'own', 'uneducated', 'parents', 'problem', 'school', 'stripper', 'son', 'inexplicably', 'chubby', 'chaser', 'website', 'turned', 'watching', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'woman', 'gorging', 'round', 'clock', 'meantime', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'secret', 'son', 'previous', 'relationship', 'been', 'transferred', 'jail', 'take', 'inmate', 'home', 'live', 'family', 'work', 'exchange', 'jail', 'time', 'found', 'part', 'story', 'little', 'hard', 'believe', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'core', 'story', 'line', 'man', 'secret', 'dream', 'lying', 'scheming', 'achieve', 'dream', 'Then', 'have', 'disgruntled', 'angry', 'wife', 'story', 'daughter', 'stripper', 'story', 'son', 'chubby', 'chaser', 'story', 'secret', 'son', 'previous', 'relationship', 'story', 'not', 'enough', 'main', 'character', 'developing', 'relationship', 'woman', 'acting', 'class', 'story', 'own', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'slow', 'sections', 'drag', 'on.The', 'good', 'news', 'hang', 'last', 'half', 'hour', ""'ll"", 'be', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'found', 'stories', 'distracting', 'particularly', 'son', 'chubby', 'chasing', 'activity', 'was', 'quite', 'disconnect', 'type', 'background', 'kid', 'came', 'really', 'were', 'satisfactory', 'explanations', 'repercussions', 'regarding', 'behavior', 'everything', 'know', 'Italian', 'families', 'Bronx', 'trust', 'know', 'Italian', 'families', 'Bronx.Of', 'film', 'Two', 'Family', 'House', ""'ll"", 'have', 'say', 'prefer', 'Two', 'Family', 'House', 'was', 'heart', 'film', 'carried', 'could', 'feel', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'longings', 'main', 'character', 'deeply', 'profoundly', 'themes', 'Two', 'Family', 'House', 'were', 'more', 'universal', 'relate-able', 'themes', 'honesty', 'loss', 'singing', 'own', 'song', 'even', 'nobody', 'else', 'sings', 'kinda', 'literally', 'City', 'Island', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'distractions', 'main', 'story', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'lose', 'sight', 'man', 'dream', 'end', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'background', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'why', ""'re"", 'even', 'there.It', 'skill', 'actors', 'film', 'actually', 'thankfully', 'so']",N/A

This mistrust builds more mistrust and deep resentment.The plot of this cute story is already described in the synopsis by Amazon.  It's a family with secrets and false suspicions, from sex and porn addictions, cigarrettes, and hidden dreams.Although Andy Garcia shines in this role as Vince Rizzo, a prison guard and acting student of a curmudgeon of a man played by Alan Arkin, other stellar performances also complete the personalities.  Wife Juliana Margulies plays the bored, frustrated houswife too bitter with resentment to think clearly about her husband.  Her suspicions run amok, causing Vince to withdraw more into his secret life.Emily Mortimer, the daughter, moonshines as a pole dancer for money after smoking away her college scholarhsip and son Steven Straight satisfies his sexual desires with the obese neighbor.  All these odd ball characters come together, though, through a former prisoner who Vince invites into his home for a month. (Why he brings this man home becomes clear later.) This young man, with a reputation to rebuild, is the only one who can see all the people with an unbaised viewpoint.  He finds himself in unplanned and precarious situations, learning the true characters of the rest of the family, and suffering a few bruises along the way.

There are several different story lines going on in this film and each major character is involved in at least one of them.  The story lines all converge in what has to be one of the most clever and funniest scenes in recent movie history - and it wasn't even the funniest scene in the movie.

Going into 'City Island' with no knowledge of the film or expectations gave me a great mindset to be surprised.At it's core, 'City Island' is a family comedy/drama, covering a few weeks in the life of family from New York City.  The twist is that each family member has a secret (or two) they are keeping from everyone else.  Hijinks ensue.  The lack of communication and trust in each relationship left me, as a viewer, the only one in on the whole story.  This led to many scenes where the viewer is waiting for the other shoe to fall, waiting for the secrets to be exposed and eager to watch the aftermath.Some of the stereotypical Italian family members are a bit grating.  The over-the-top arguments, the jumping-to-conclusions and then acting out on a whim, etc. felt a bit forced and were frustrating as a viewer.  Also, Alan Arkin just seems to be thrown into a few almost cameo scenes to boost the star power of the film.  His presence is distracting, as his role of acting coach could have been played by a no-name actor.Overall, it is a fairly inoffensive, engaging family-based film that keeps the viewer hanging on to see what will happen next, with a fairly predictable, but satisfying ending.",4,Family Comedy/Drama with a twist,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,1333,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', ""'City"", 'Island', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'decent', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'work', 'Going', ""'City"", 'Island', 'knowledge', 'film', 'expectations', 'gave', 'great', 'mindset', 'be', 'surprised.At', 'core', ""'City"", 'Island', 'family', 'comedy/drama', 'covering', 'few', 'weeks', 'life', 'family', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'twist', 'family', 'member', 'secret', 'two', 'are', 'keeping', 'everyone', 'else', 'Hijinks', 'ensue', 'lack', 'communication', 'trust', 'relationship', 'left', 'viewer', 'only', 'one', 'whole', 'story', 'led', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'viewer', 'waiting', 'other', 'shoe', 'fall', 'waiting', 'secrets', 'be', 'exposed', 'eager', 'watch', 'aftermath.Some', 'stereotypical', 'Italian', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'bit', 'grating', 'over-the-top', 'arguments', 'jumping-to-conclusions', 'then', 'acting', 'out', 'whim', 'etc', 'felt', 'bit', 'forced', 'were', 'frustrating', 'viewer', 'Also', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'just', 'be', 'thrown', 'few', 'almost', 'cameo', 'scenes', 'boost', 'star', 'power', 'film', 'presence', 'distracting', 'role', 'acting', 'coach', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'no-name', 'actor.Overall', 'fairly', 'inoffensive', 'engaging', 'family-based', 'film', 'viewer', 'hanging', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'satisfying', 'ending']",N/A

And in the end, they all realize that the secret each has been hiding is found to be so insignificant and forgivable by everyone else, that they come to see how much they all love one another. I know... this may sound a little like too much of a feel good movie, but it all unfolds so amazingly naturally, it's definitely not what I'd call one of those soppy movies.This movie turned out to be one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time, because the humor is not forced or contrived.

This is a good vehicle for delivering this look at a wacky Latino family. The movie is smart and well written with a good ensemble cast that keep the laughter flowing with crazy situations. The Indie flavored dark comedy smacks of a European style comedy, intelligence in the script is not lost amongst the jokes and quirky situations because it makes one think of situations they have have either had that were similar or people one may have known who had similar experiences. Of course, that all the crazy situations can exist in one family is a bit preposterous but it's a comedy not a docudrama. Without giving spoilers, as there are plenty floating about in other reviews, I  would suggest you check this movie out for a good night of laughs and maybe reconsidering how one's own family may not be so dysfunctional or maybe more so.

1328941,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B0036TGT8Y,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 0]","The Rizzo family of City Island is keeping many secrets.  Afraid they'll be made public, each member is hiding them by telling lies.  Consequently, everyone is living alone on an island of fear and shame.  The father Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia, ""Ocean`s Thirteen,"" ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" and ""Jennifer Eight"") is taking acting classes while supposedly playing poker.  His daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido, ""The Lost City"") has been expelled from school and is stripping at a club.  His son Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller, Damien on ""Californication"") has a crush on the obese neighbor who has a private porn site.  Feeling neglected, Vince's wife Joyce (Julianna Marguiles, ""Snakes on a Plane"" and ""Ghost Ship"") begins lusting after the hunky convict Tony Nardella (Steven Strait, ""10,000 B.C."" and ""The Covenant"") whom Vince brings home from the prison where he is a correctional officer.  No one suspects that Tony is Vince's child from a brief affair he had twenty-four years ago.  Soon secrets and lies are revealed, leading to dramatic consequences that are both hilarious and heart warming.City Island of the Bronx is a well kept secret.  According to the director Raymond De Felita, who is famous for his family dramas (""The Thing About My Folks"" and ""Two Family House""), many people in Manhattan aren't aware of its existence.  The citizens of City Island would like to keep it that way.  However, that may change due to the overwhelming popularity of this emotionally charged film that made me both laugh and cry.  The film was actually shot on City Island and Manhattan.  The cast and crew secretly lived on several blocks of the island, which consists approximately of one square mile.  The scenery is beautiful as well as the cast, which was perfectly chosen.  I kept thinking that all the lead actors looked like family members.  Then I was surprised to learn that Dominik Garcia-Lorido is Andy Garcia's real-life daughter.  In fact, they have starred in three movies together.  There was a tremendous amount of chemistry between the lead actors and the director as evidenced by the short featurette ""Dinner with the Rizzos.""  Thy all meshed well together.  A tremendous amount of talent was sitting around that dinner table.Vince Rizzo is a very likeable man.  He is proud of his heritage.  He enjoys living on City Island and wouldn't dream of living anywhere else.  Vince brags that his grandfather built the house that he and his family live in.  He loves his family very much.  His beautiful wife is the air that he breathes.  The inhabitants of City Island are very proud of their heritage.  Those who have spent generations on the island are referred to as clam diggers and new comers are referred to as mud suckers.  Vince, like everyone else, has made a few mistakes in his life.  One of them was abandoning his son Tony when he was born.  It is the darkest secret of his life and now, twenty-four years later, it has come back to haunt him.  However, this is not the only secret he has been hiding from his family.  The other is his dream of becoming an actor; he's afraid his wife won't support him.  Maybe not, but he has a right to tell her instead of lying about going to poker games that are not happening.  The children, who sense there is a lack of trust among their parents, are afraid to tell the truth themselves.  They, like their father, feel they will experience rejection.  Therefore, the lovely Vivian doesn't tell her parents she has been expelled from school and the comedic son, Vince Jr., doesn't tell them he has an attraction for obese women.  While Vince Jr. is spying on the neighbor, Joyce is spying on the muscular convict Tony.You must watch the deleted and extended scenes.  During the last scene, when Vince is in acting class, he gives a tearful confession about lying to his family.  I think this scene sums up the entire theme of ""City Island"":  Open, honest communication is important for keeping a family together.  City Island seems like that fantasy place where the happy families live.  Every family can live on their own City Island if they truly love each other and aren't afraid to express it.  ""City Island"" is highly recommended for those who love heart warming, humorous family drama.  Anchor Bay did a wonderful job of presenting it in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  It has English subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired.  Other poignant dramas from Anchor Bay that I highly recommend are:  ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" ""Bart Got a Room,"" ""Last Chance Harvey,"" and ""Henry Poole is Here.""Joseph B.

I was a bit intrigued on how the two would work together and I have to say I was not disappointed.City Island reminds me of a real life Simpsons episode.  This movie could be a documentary of the dysfunctional American family.  Vince Rizzo is a meek Correctional Officer who secretly inspires to be an actor.  Rather than let his loud, brash, wife in on his secret, he would rather let his wife believe he is out playing around than reveal his secret that he is taking acting classes.  The fragile foundation of this dysfunctional family come crashing down with the introduction of Tony Nardella, the convict Vince feels sorry for and brings home from prison, whose honesty causes the families secrets and lies to become uncovered.City Island is a movie that works on several levels.  On the surface, it actually is a great quality comedy.  Similar to the movie Forrest Gump, each time I watched the movie, I saw a bit more of the genius behind it.  The movie makes an excellent point about how we let our own walls and perceptions entrap us in life.  Sometimes we need to do what we want, even if it does not make sense to other.  Also, the movie really shows how the social misfit can really be the sanest person in the room.The acting in this film is absolutely first rate.  Of the main characters in the film, there was not a weak link amongst the actors.  In my opinion, Julianna Margulies put on a stellar performance as the flamboyant, hot headed wife.The only downfall to the movie is that it is nowhere as good when you watch it subsequent times.  Personally, I can watch an excellent comedy over and over again.  While this movie is excellent the first time I watched it, it just does not draw me to watch it over and over again.  Overall, I thought this was an excellent movie.  It is an excellent balance of comedy and romance.  Due to adult situations, this is definitely a move to watch when the little kids go to bed.  I think it would be an excellent movie to watch on a date or to cuddle with the SO to.",5,A Real Life Version Of The Simpsons,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,2149,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'admirer', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'acting', 'abilities', 'have', 'been', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'fan', 'ER', 'days', 'was', 'bit', 'intrigued', 'how', 'two', 'would', 'work', 'together', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.City', 'Island', 'real', 'life', 'Simpsons', 'episode', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'documentary', 'dysfunctional', 'American', 'family', 'Vince', 'Rizzo', 'meek', 'Correctional', 'Officer', 'who', 'secretly', 'be', 'actor', 'Rather', 'let', 'loud', 'brash', 'wife', 'secret', 'would', 'rather', 'let', 'wife', 'believe', 'out', 'playing', 'reveal', 'secret', 'taking', 'acting', 'classes', 'fragile', 'foundation', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'introduction', 'Tony', 'Nardella', 'convict', 'Vince', 'feels', 'sorry', 'home', 'prison', 'honesty', 'families', 'secrets', 'become', 'uncovered.City', 'Island', 'movie', 'several', 'levels', 'surface', 'actually', 'great', 'quality', 'comedy', 'Similar', 'movie', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'saw', 'bit', 'more', 'genius', 'movie', 'excellent', 'point', 'how', 'let', 'own', 'walls', 'perceptions', 'entrap', 'life', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'even', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'other', 'Also', 'movie', 'really', 'how', 'social', 'misfit', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'sanest', 'person', 'room.The', 'acting', 'film', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'weak', 'link', 'actors', 'opinion', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'put', 'stellar', 'performance', 'flamboyant', 'hot', 'headed', 'wife.The', 'only', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'when', 'watch', 'subsequent', 'times', 'Personally', 'can', 'watch', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'over', 'again', 'movie', 'excellent', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'just', 'not', 'draw', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'excellent', 'balance', 'comedy', 'romance', 'Due', 'adult', 'situations', 'definitely', 'move', 'watch', 'when', 'little', 'kids', 'go', 'bed', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'movie', 'watch', 'date', 'cuddle', 'SO']",N/A

It's unfortunate that little films like these don't make the big bucks and do not get the ad budgets they deserve. Conratulations to Raymond and may he continue making his little heartfelt gems like these. In both films the casts, dilaogue shine.

1328951,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0036TGT8Y,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I think that it's become my mantra--""quirk is the curse of independent cinema."" In an effort to be cutesy and/or clever, films have been systematically stripping away genuine warmth and humor by presenting character types and sitcom contrivances instead of mining what is really funny in our everyday foibles. It becomes a fine balancing act, then, because a good quirky film can be both hysterical and touch your heartstrings. However, one that goes over the top can be painfully unreal and hard to sit through. And, in my opinion, there is very little middle ground. So it is with some trepidation that I picked up ""City Island,"" a family comedy that promised to explore the eccentricities (code word for quirk) and secrets in the working class Rizzo clan. And, in a pleasant surprise, here the quirk works!Headlined by Andy Garcia and Julianna Margulies, ""City Island"" follows the boisterous Rizzo family as it navigates its way through enough secrets and deceptions to fuel several movies. Everyone is lying to everyone else! Garcia has a ""secret"" love child who is a convict, Margulies suspect him of cheating when he's ""secretly"" taking acting classes, their son has a ""secret"" fetish, their daughter has a ""secret"" job, and everyone ""secretly"" smokes--heck even Garcia's acting partner (Emily Mortimer) has a big ""secret."" That's a lot of secrets and leads to a lot of confrontation for one movie. But inexplicably, ""City Island"" and its immensely likable cast juggle these story lines like pros. The set-up is genuinely funny and the big revelations strike just the right note between hilarity and warmth.Garcia is a hoot through-out, but credit must be given to the entire cast. Mortimer, in a role that might have been a disaster, provides genuine intelligence and pathos. Ezra Miller, as the son, is spot on hilarious--especially in the film's first half. And Steven Strait, as the love child con, is a revelation as the voice of reason within the madness! Writer/Director Raymond De Felitta has taken my worst nightmare and turned in one of the more effortlessly enjoyable films I've seen in a while. Slight, but very funny, ""City Island"" is a definite recommendation.

Don't lie, you know you can!Enter the Rizzos, the latest in bizarre and dysfunctional families to (hopefully) enter a home theater near you to dazzle you with their complete inability to just tell the truth.  First we have Vince played by Andy Garcia, who is a prison gaur-... er... ""correctional officer,"" that wants to secretly pursue his childhood passion of acting but cannot bring himself to tell his wife, who thinks he's cheating on her.  Then there's their daughter, who is supposed to be studying at school but is not, their chubby-chasing teenage son that deserves a severe blow to the head before satisfying his lust with the... big girl next door.  Lastly, there's the ex-con that Vince fished out of prison because he (secretly) knows it is his long-lost son, but cannot tell anyone about it.  Surprisingly, the ex-con is the most honest of them all.Between this complex array of secrecy you have other subplots involving allegedly quitting smoking, stripper joints, auditions with big shot directors, a 'British' acting ""manager,"" and a very weird website involving feeding a woman.  While most films with THIS degree of deception require a schematic be included with the bonus contents of the DVD, City Island masterfully illustrates the web of shadows with simple, yet hilarious, dialog and an easy pace that even ADD-prone viewers like me can follow.The story is hilarious; it's funny to see the characters try to (poorly) deceive their other with one lie being more outrageous than the last all culminating to a final honesty shootout outside the home that Vince's great granddad built.  I found myself genuinely laughing a few times here and was able to relate to a few things with the characters.The acting is surprisingly well done especially given that Andy Garcia usually plays the bad guy or a really suave character, not a family man trying to follow his childhood dream.  It's almost adorable... which is SOO not your typical Andy Garcia.  I'm not too familiar with the rest of the cast, hell I thought the wife was that bubbly ""Flo"" girl from the Progressive Insurance commercials for half the movie.  Regardless of past recognition, the cast did a very convincing job of being a dysfunctional family from the Bronx with complete hardcore NY accents.All in all I really enjoyed this film.  The landscape actually makes me wanna move away from the sustained -40 winters in Bismarck and settle down on the nice quiet beaches of City Island...

It is a pity because this is a sweet, funny, and charming movie that I would have enjoyed on the big screen.  The dysfunctional family overcoming a comedy of errors story line did strike me as a bit generic but the location, good acting and a good comedic touch by the director (Raymond De Felitta) transformed this into a very enjoyable movie.Location: City Island, a part of New York City, is a little island in the Long Island Sound just off of the Bronx. It is connected to the mainland by a short bridge.  Like Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, it is a little enclave where New Yorkers find a little respite from city living on hot summer days and nights.  It was always a fun place to go when I was a kid, and as a young man, for dates and seafood since I was not in a position to head for ""the Cape"" or the Hamptons for a more expensive night or weekend on the town.  The movie portrays accurately the pretty marked drawing line between lifelong residents and the tourists and newly arrived.The Plot/Acting:  Andy Garcia and Julianna Margulies play Vince and Joyce Rizzo. Vince is a prison guard at Rikers Island who dreams of becoming an actor.  Joyce is his wife who has had her share of dreams deferred and who is busy dealing with their two kids and wondering if Vince is slipping away and having an affair.  Their teenage son is enamored with large women and desperately tries to hide his passion for a large school at school and the very large woman who lives across the street.  Their daughter is, supposedly, the bright star in the family, but is leading a secret life of her own.As the story moves forward we see how each carefully guarded secret causes everyone else to misinterpret what the others are doing.  That does sound rather generic to me and perhaps to anyone reading this review.  However, Garcia played Vince so well and was so endearing that any notions of this being a generic film soon slipped away. Margulies was also excellent and the relationship between the two of them, and the whole family dynamic came across as funny, natural, and `real'.  Alan Arkin has a small role as an aging, bitter acting coach and he plays it to the hilt.  Similarly, Emily Mortimer plays another acting student that Vince forms a very strong bond with.As the misunderstandings mount so to does the comedy and turmoil.  The resolution is one that may be expected but it played out very well.Extras:  There really isn't much in the way of extras here.Conclusion:  City Island should entertain you and keep you laughing and nodding throughout.

Andy Garcia, a prison guard, is cast a family man, married to Juliana Margulies who has a secretarial job.  They have a teenage son who is obsessed with fat women and a college age daughter who, unbeknownst to her parents, works in a strip club.  Andy Garcia has a secret though.  He tells his wife he has a weekly poker game but instead he is taking acting lessons.Another secret he has is that when he was in his late teens he fathered a son, and one day he discovers that this son, who is now grown up, happens to be a prisoner who is about to be paroled.  This role is played by Steven Strait, who is indeed a hunk.

Rather than confiding his dream to his wife, Joyce (Julianna Margulies), he tells her that he plays poker once a week, but he is really taking dramatic lessons.Vince also has another, darker secret.  He has an adult out-of-wedlock son, Tony (Steven Strait), conceived prior to meeting Joyce.  Because Tony's mother was a ""psycho bitch,"" he abandoned the boy before birth, but now discovers him to be a ""resident"" in his prison.Vince's legitimate kids also have their problems.  Daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) lost her college scholarship and now, unknown to her parents, works as a stripper.  Son Vince, Jr. (Ezra Miller), on the other hand, skips school regularly and has a ""thing"" for grossly overweight women.So that the young man can get an early parole, Vince decides to bring Tony into his home.  [Neither Tony nor Vince's family knows that Vince is Tony's father.]  About the same time, encouraged by his acting partner (Emily Mortimer) who has her own secrets, Vince auditions for a major film and his clandestine behavior convinces Joyce that he is having an affair.Further misunderstandings in the household bring all secrets out into the open.Written and directed by Raymond De Felitta, CITY ISLAND is a warm, joyful comedy about a dysfunctional family that finds its way ""home"".Like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and UP IN THE AIR, this is one of those original comedies where the people and their emotions are real.  There are no ""jokes,"" yet we laugh at the humor of the situations because, though the specifics might be different or less dramatic, we are laughing at the parallels to our own lives.The dialogue is quick and witty, and performances by the entire cast are superb.Perhaps the funniest scene in the picture belongs to Alan Arkin, cast as Vince's acting coach, who at one point rants about how he hates actors who use ""pauses"" in their work.

Both films depict dysfunctional families nearing collapse, and both are blessed with razor-sharp screenplays and ensemble casts that are wonderfully, hilariously perfect. Each member of the cast (especially top-billed Andy Garcia) gives an Oscar-worthy performance, and all will be robbed if they don't win the Screen Actors Guild Best Ensemble Cast Award next year.The eponymous ""City Island"" is a small community just off the shoreline of the Bronx, officially part of that borough but with a small-town charm all its own. As Molly Charlesworth (Emily Mortimer), one of the film's characters, declares, ""It's a cross between New England and Washington Heights!"" Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) is a ""clamdigger"" (a lifelong resident of City Island), as opposed to a ""mussel-sucker"" (someone who moves to City Island, or one of those very rare natives who moves away). Vince works as a prison guard (though he prefers the term ""corrections officer""), but that job doesn't seem to satisfy him these days. His wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies), daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) and son Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller) wonder why Vince has a ""poker game"" almost every night, and also why he's brought paroled convict Tony Nardella (Steven Strait) home to live with them. The other Rizzos, meanwhile, are harboring secrets of their own...To reveal any more of the plot would be sabotage. Let's just say the bickering of the Rizzo family reaches critical mass, with catharsis to follow. In any case, you fall in love with all the characters, and although you might be a little leery of some of the things they do, you'd still be happy to have them all over for your Sunday barbeque.

There's romance, laughter, drama, a few scant tears, and, most of all, tons of deception. All of the characters in the story have some ""hidden"" aspect of their lives that they're desperately trying to keep the others from discovering. The plot centers around what happens when their plans go awry and their covers are inadvertently blown. The acting is really top-notch all around--especially Andy Garcia and Julianna Margulies, who spearhead the story and skillfully lend it warm, down-to-earth believability.Many people have compared City Island to Little Miss Sunshine (a movie I also greatly enjoyed and own), and I definitely see the similarities--not the least of which is the superb Alan Arkin, who sadly has but a small role in City Island. The movies are similar in that at the center of the story is a dysfunctional family whom we can all relate to in some way; what's more, both are genuinely funny, humble movies with a lot of heart.The DVD features a few extras, including a handful of deleted scenes and a dinner with the cast and director one year later, where they discuss humorous and notable aspects of making the movie.If you liked the ""slice of life"" loving dysfunction of Little Miss Sunshine, and if you enjoy indie movies in general (as in, you're not expecting an action-packed, clich&eacute;-filled tripe of cheap-shot laughs), then you'll probably enjoy City Island.

Outside the family comes an ex-con, Tony, who Vince decides would make a good house guest so that he can make parole.  Tony also factors into a couple of the secrets that play out as well.  The story that unfolds is chalk full of comedic error as the lies begin to fall apart.  All of the actors play their parts well, but Vince, Jr. (Ezra Miller) is great with his over the top lines.  Garcia also has a great scene when he auditions for a part in a movie.  I think the movie is well paced, and I never found myself wondering if it was over yet.

They hide it from each until the secrets blows up causing considerable chaos and shame on each other. Rizzo's live in a sea-side town called City Island; the father Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) works as a corrections officer (prison guard) is interested to become an actor. Instead of discussing with his wife and family, he begins to take acting classes and allow his fiery wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies) believe he has an extramarital affair. His son's secret is that he has is infatuated with full figured women and his daughter works as a stripper at a local club to pay for her education. His wife Joyce is attracted to a young ex-con on parole that Vince has brought to stay with them. When Joyce learns his secret girlfriend is his acting partner (Emily Mortimer) she becomes outraged and sets out to have a romantic evening with Vince's ex-con friend, it becomes evident that he is not interested in Joyce for some strange reason. He sets out to make things straight by abducting Vince's daughter from strip club and pressure her to reveal to the family about her secret. It turns out that this young ex-con is the son of Vince from another woman before he met Joyce.

1328974,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0036TGT8Y,RMurray847,"[6, 9]","Compelling new releases have been somewhat hard to come by at the Multiplex lately, so out of mild desperation for entertainment more than anything, my wife and I went to see CITY ISLAND.  What a wonderful treat this movie is!  It's so full of heart and messages of affirmation that we immediately told others about it.  If by some chance it drifts into a theater near you...check it out.CITY ISLAND introduces us to the Rizzo family.  Father Vince (Andy Garcia) is a prison guard.  His wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies) is an office manager.  They have two teenage kids, college student Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorida) and high schooler Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller).  They live on the amazing City Island, a place I've never heard of (but I came home and found it on a map of the NYC area.)  It's an island just off the ""coast"" of the Bronx...a sort of fishing village in the middle of a major metropolitan area.  The Rizzo's are solidly middle class, but because their family has owned this house for 3 generations, they live right on a beach with a view of the city!  The island is truly a character in the film, and one day, I'd love to drive through it.Each Rizzo has a secret.  Vivian has lost her scholarship and rather than tell her parents, she's working a pole dancer to earn money to pay for her own return to school.  Junior is a super-smart kid (he's like the precocious son on UNITED STATES OF TARA) with a fetish for feeding huge quantities of food to very large women.  Wife Joyce is mostly just unhappy, because she feels distant from her husband.  That distance is no doubt created by Vince's big secret.  He tells his wife he's going to ""poker games"" when in fact, he's going into the city to take acting lessons.  He feels deep shame over this secret desire, and of course, his wife picks up those vibes and assumes Vince is actually having an affair.  And he only spills his secrets to a classmate (Emily Mortimer), a lovely, wacky, fragile Englishwoman with secrets of her own.  The two of them are drawn together deeply, but not as lovers but as co-conspirators and as two individuals deeply drawn to acting.This would all be complicated enough...but Vince has another secret that comes home to roost.  Decades before, even before he'd met Joyce, he had a child out of wedlock and abandoned the mother and child.  Then one day, his now grown son ends up as an inmate at the prison.  Vince offers to take this stranger Tony (Steven Strait) out of prison to live with him at his home, because the only thing keeping Tony in jail was the lack of anyone willing to vouch for him.  But Vince is so secretive, he tells NO ONE (except Emily Mortimer) that Tony is his son.  Naturally Vince's family wonders just what the heck has gotten into Vince...bringing this strange ex-con to live in their home.You might gather just from the paragraph above that CITY ISLAND relies on coincidence.  It is, in fact, packed with coincidence...and I've heard other say that the plot resembles a Greek tragedy in its entanglements and coincidences.  HUGE, massive misunderstandings and hurt feelings ensue.But the film has a splendid, optimistic heart.  We root for ALL the characters in the film, big and small.  Each person has traits that drive the viewer crazy, but each has a warm center and generally good intentions.  The plot may be lacking in credibility, but it is so skillfully written and so earnestly performed that we joyfully cast aside objections to the ludicrous proceedings and just kick back and enjoy.  EVERYONE in the film is good, but I must give special mention to Steven Strait (sadly, known to me only from 10,000 BC) and Andy Garcia.  Strait is perfect in this part.  We see that he's not really a hardened criminal, but we  also see the danger lurking.  He's a gentle soul who has been badly mistreated for much of his life.  Yet he is also very amusing as we watch him watching this dysfunctional family he has joined.  And Garcia is one of the most winning ""heroes"" I've seen in awhile.  He hides his secrets with no malice...he just assumes he'll be ridiculed for his acting.  We can see how he has hidden his ""real"" self for so many years.  And he plays perplexed very well indeed.  (I'll also mention that Garcia is working with his own daughter on this film, playing his fictional daughter.  It's nepotism...but she certainly is very fine in the role, and desired it.)There is an audition scene that is absolutely hilarious.  It probably helps to have been an actor to truly appreciate it...but honestly, I can't imagine anyone not laughing outloud and strongly rooting for poor Vince during this scene.  I'd almost say the movie is worth seeing just for that...but fortunately, it's worth seeing for everything else as well.Overlook the preposterous plot and enjoy the warm characters and lovely scenery of CITY ISLAND.",4,"4.5 stars.

Thus, the movie ""City Island"" introduced me to a small fishing village of that name in, the Bronx, New York, of all places.  City Island is a quaint close-knit fishing village of about 4000 people on the west end of Long Island Sound.  This movie, which won the audience award at the Tribecca Film Festival in 2009, is set and was filmed in City Island.  It is a town of old homes, beaches, bridges, fishing vessels, and the water. Residents of City Island distinguish between ""Mussel Suckers"" - the larger part of the community born outside the community and ""Clam Diggers"" those residents who grew up in City Island.  This distinction is carried over into the movie.The story itself might have happened anywhere, but it gains strength by the setting in a small urban area where people seemingly know their neighbors. The movie tells of the secrets that people hold from those closest to them and of the difficulties of opening up. The main character is the Rizzo family.  Vincent Rizzo, played by Andy Garcia who also produced the movie is a middle-aged corrections office (he resents the term ""prison guard"") who harbors dreams of being an actor.  He attends acting school one evening a week and, to avoid embarrassment, tells his disbelieving wife that he is out for a poker night. A woman student at the acting school with secrets of her own encourages Vince who begins as an imitator of Marlon Brando and learns to act in his own person and character. Against odds, newcomer Vince auditions for a tough-guy part in a movie by Scorsese.Vince's  hard-bitten wife, Joyce, (Juliana Margulies) feels lonely and frustrated as she feels the passion between Vincent and herself has died. She thinks Vince is having an affair during his ""poker night"" and of course thinks the worst when she meets Vince's acting companion. The couple have two children, Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) who unknown to her family has dropped out of college and is working as a stripper in the hope of returning to school  and high school student Vince, Jr. (Ezra Miller).  Ezra is strongly attracted to big beautiful women (BBWs), including his neighbor who has a BBW cam site  and a young girl in his high school class who at the outset spurns him. It was endearing and refreshing to see a story of men who are attracted to large women. Vince Rizzo also has a secret in that before his marriage to Joyce he fathered a child and then left the mother.  The son he had never met, Tony, (Steven Sttrait) winds up in prison.  Without revealing his identity, Vince brings Tony into his home.  The movie features a long denouement in which the family, and other associated characters level with each other and learn who they themselves, and the other people, each are.City Island is an entertaining well-acted movie about the difficulty of knowing self and others. In an unpretentious way, it gets inside the feelings and dreams of its characters.  But the movie also taught me about a place I hadn't seen or heard of before and made it come to life. I loved seeing it, and I found getting to know City Island the place the main attraction of this movie.Robin Friedman",4,Mussel Suckers and Clam Diggers,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,3255,"['Reading', 'movies', 'offer', 'opportunity', 'explore', 'new', 'unusual', 'places', 'not', 'far', 'home', 'Thus', 'movie', 'City', 'Island', 'introduced', 'small', 'fishing', 'village', 'name', 'Bronx', 'New', 'York', 'places', 'City', 'Island', 'quaint', 'close-knit', 'fishing', 'village', '4000', 'people', 'west', 'end', 'Long', 'Island', 'Sound', 'movie', 'won', 'audience', 'award', 'Tribecca', 'Film', 'Festival', '2009', 'set', 'was', 'filmed', 'City', 'Island', 'town', 'old', 'homes', 'beaches', 'bridges', 'fishing', 'vessels', 'water', 'Residents', 'City', 'Island', 'distinguish', 'Mussel', 'Suckers', 'larger', 'part', 'community', 'born', 'community', 'Clam', 'Diggers', 'residents', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'City', 'Island', 'distinction', 'carried', 'movie.The', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'anywhere', 'gains', 'strength', 'setting', 'small', 'urban', 'area', 'where', 'people', 'seemingly', 'know', 'neighbors', 'movie', 'tells', 'secrets', 'people', 'hold', 'closest', 'difficulties', 'opening', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'Rizzo', 'family', 'Vincent', 'Rizzo', 'played', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'movie', 'middle-aged', 'corrections', 'office', 'term', 'prison', 'guard', 'who', 'harbors', 'dreams', 'being', 'actor', 'acting', 'school', 'one', 'evening', 'week', 'avoid', 'embarrassment', 'disbelieving', 'wife', 'out', 'poker', 'night', 'woman', 'student', 'acting', 'school', 'secrets', 'own', 'encourages', 'Vince', 'who', 'imitator', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'act', 'own', 'person', 'character', 'Against', 'newcomer', 'Vince', 'auditions', 'tough-guy', 'part', 'movie', 'Scorsese.Vince', 'hard-bitten', 'wife', 'Joyce', 'Juliana', 'Margulies', 'lonely', 'frustrated', 'passion', 'Vincent', 'died', 'Vince', 'having', 'affair', 'poker', 'night', 'course', 'worst', 'when', 'Vince', 'acting', 'companion', 'couple', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'Vivian', 'Dominik', 'Garcia-Lorido', 'who', 'unknown', 'family', 'dropped', 'college', 'working', 'stripper', 'hope', 'returning', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Vince', 'Jr.', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'Ezra', 'strongly', 'attracted', 'big', 'beautiful', 'women', 'BBWs', 'including', 'neighbor', 'who', 'BBW', 'cam', 'site', 'young', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'who', 'outset', 'was', 'endearing', 'refreshing', 'see', 'story', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'attracted', 'large', 'women', 'Vince', 'Rizzo', 'also', 'secret', 'marriage', 'Joyce', 'fathered', 'child', 'then', 'left', 'mother', 'son', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'Tony', 'Steven', 'Sttrait', 'up', 'prison', 'revealing', 'identity', 'Vince', 'Tony', 'home', 'movie', 'long', 'denouement', 'family', 'other', 'associated', 'characters', 'level', 'other', 'learn', 'who', 'other', 'people', 'are.City', 'Island', 'entertaining', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'difficulty', 'knowing', 'self', 'others', 'unpretentious', 'way', 'feelings', 'dreams', 'characters', 'movie', 'also', 'taught', 'place', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'heard', 'before', 'made', 'come', 'life', 'loved', 'seeing', 'found', 'getting', 'know', 'City', 'Island', 'place', 'main', 'attraction', 'movie.Robin', 'Friedman']",N/A

He smokes, but doesn't want anyone to know.  He pines to be an actor, even taking an acting class when his wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies) thinks he's out playing poker with the boys.  And one of his biggest secrets, that he fathered a child before he met Joyce, becomes the fuse that lights up an explosion of revelations.Vince is a corrections officer (not a ""prison guard,"" as he is quick to remind people).  One day during the daily inmate roll call, he notices a familiar last name, his girlfriend when he was 19.  He looks in the inmate's file, recognizes the mother's name, and realizes that he is this young man's father.  He brings Tony (Steven Strait) home under a ""release to family member"" program, but doesn't tell Tony the reason.  Tony just thinks it's a prison guard getting free labor to work around the house.In the meantime, Vince's acting efforts go in a surprising direction, as does Joyce's affections.  In the end (probably as expected), it can best be described as ""All's Well that Ends Well.""The acting is great, and the scenes at the dinner table will make you glad you are not invited to dinner at the Rizzo residence!

Customer reviews on Amazon were running between 4 and 5 stars and around 3 1/2 on Netflix. Most reviews I read said it was gut-busting hilarious and one of the funniest movies they'd seen in years. Of my 3 friends and I, none of us found it hilarious or even close to one of the funniest movies we'd seen. Does it have laughs? Sure, but I'm not even sure I'd classify it as a comedy. Comedy-drama perhaps. Tragicomedy, perhaps.Andy Garcia and Julianna Margulies are both good as an Italian couple from the Bronx who love one another but do a lot of yelling. The teenage son has an obsession with fat women and the daughter who is supposedly off at college is actually a stripper. They all smoke but hide it from one another. Garcia's character is a prison guard and aspiring actor who tells his wife he's going to poker games when, in fact, he is taking acting lessons. In short, everyone in this family invests a lot of time and energy in lying to one another. There's only so many laughs you can wring from that...and from the constant screaming they do. For those of us who grew up with parents who screamed at one another all the time, it really is not that funny (esp. not when it goes on and on).There is some nice eye candy in the young man that Andy's character brings home from prison to live temporarily with the family. He is sans shirt during much of the movie and not only handsome but very nicely built. I liked the character of the teenage son, who was an enormous smartass (as teenage boys can be). He was great at communicating what he was thinking/feeling through his eyes and face, and he had some great smartcracking lines, especially around the dinner table.In summary, while I enjoyed the movie on some levels, it was definitely not as hilarious as the reviews would have you believe, and the story seemed too cookie cutter cliched, like it was written by a computer program.",3,I doubt I'd ever watch it again.,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,2033,"['invited', 'friends', 'watch', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'checked', 'customer', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Netflix', 'Customer', 'Amazon', 'were', 'running', '4', '5', 'stars', '3', '1/2', 'Netflix', 'Most', 'reviews', 'read', 'said', 'was', 'gut-busting', 'hilarious', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'d"", 'seen', 'years', '3', 'friends', 'none', 'found', 'hilarious', 'even', 'close', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'d"", 'seen', 'have', 'laughs', 'Sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', ""'d"", 'classify', 'comedy', 'Comedy-drama', 'perhaps', 'Tragicomedy', 'perhaps.Andy', 'Garcia', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'are', 'good', 'Italian', 'couple', 'Bronx', 'who', 'love', 'one', 'do', 'lot', 'yelling', 'teenage', 'son', 'obsession', 'fat', 'women', 'daughter', 'who', 'supposedly', 'off', 'college', 'actually', 'stripper', 'smoke', 'hide', 'one', 'Garcia', 'character', 'prison', 'guard', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'who', 'wife', 'going', 'poker', 'games', 'when', 'fact', 'taking', 'acting', 'lessons', 'short', 'everyone', 'family', 'lot', 'time', 'energy', 'lying', 'one', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'laughs', 'can', 'wring', 'constant', 'screaming', 'do', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'parents', 'who', 'screamed', 'one', 'time', 'really', 'not', 'funny', 'esp', 'not', 'when', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'young', 'man', 'Andy', 'character', 'home', 'prison', 'live', 'temporarily', 'family', 'sans', 'shirt', 'much', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'handsome', 'very', 'nicely', 'built', 'liked', 'character', 'teenage', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'enormous', 'smartass', 'teenage', 'boys', 'can', 'be', 'was', 'great', 'communicating', 'what', 'was', 'thinking/feeling', 'eyes', 'face', 'had', 'great', 'smartcracking', 'lines', 'especially', 'dinner', 'table.In', 'summary', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'levels', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'hilarious', 'reviews', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'story', 'seemed', 'too', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'cliched', 'was', 'written', 'computer', 'program']",N/A

Vince works as a corrections officer, but longs to become an actor and is ashamed to air his aspirations to his family. Vince would rather let his volatile wife, Joyce (Julianna Margulies), believe his weekly poker games are a front for an extramarital affair than admit he's secretly taking acting classes in Manhattan.Vince isn't the only one with a secret.  His teenage Vince, Jr. (Ezra Miller), has a fetish for obese women and his daughter, Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Garcia's real-life daughter), has been expelled from college and is working as a stripper.Asked in class to reveal his biggest secret, Vince inadvertently sets off a chaotic chain of events that turns his low-key life into turmoil when he brings his long-lost ex-con son Tony (Steven Strait) home to meet the family.  To complete the portrait of nearly universal deception, Vince's acting partner (Emily Mortimer) and drama coach (Alan Arkin) also harbor secrets.Raymond De Felitta wrote, produced, and directed ""City Island.""

1328996,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0036TGT8Y,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[4, 4]","I have to say that ""City Island"" is one interesting little piece of cinema.  This 2009 movie features Andy Garcia and Julianna Margulies in the leads.  I found it kind of refreshing to see Andy Garcia in a lead role again.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s good old Andy was a head liner.  However, in the past few years he has taken supporting roles, which hasn't influenced any of his performances but has taken him out of the ""spot light"".  In ""City Island"" I am happy to report that Andy Garcia is in the ""spot light"" again.  This isn't to say that the rest of the cast is sub par.  Julianna Margulies, who I was only familiar with from ""ER"", is amazing.  As well as a strong supporting cast featuring Steven Strait, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Ezra Miller, Emily Mortimer and Alan Arkin (in a small role).The movie takes place in City Island which is a section of the Bronx.  Andy Garcia plays a corrections officer named Vince who has desire to be an actor.  This desire has manifested in him going to weekly acting classes.  However, he is ashamed that his family won't understand his ""true calling"" so he just tells his family he is playing poker.  Julianna Margulies plays Joyce and she believes that her husband isn't playing poker, but drifting away from her emotionally by having an affair.  Dominik Garcia-Lorido and Ezra Miller play Vivian and Vince Jr., respectively, the daughter and son of the family.  Vivian has her own skeletons, she is a college student who lost her scholarship and is now a stripper to pay her way through school.  Vince Jr. is also a bit alienated; he is a caustic teenager with a fetish towards overweight woman and his yearning to feed them.Now this dysfunctional family hides all of their idiosyncrasies from one and other, which leads to a great deal of circumstantial comedy.  Yet, things become even more complex when Vince notices that a new inmate (Steven Strait) is his long lost son.  Twenty-four years ago, Vince left a ""girlfriend"" of his who was pregnant.  After some deductive reasoning he figures out this inmate is his son.  So Vince tells Tony, the long lost son now inmate, that he is willing to bail him out if he would stay with him for a month.  This sabbatical for Tony is a hidden agenda for Vince to tell his ""son"" the truth, but Vince masks this by saying he wants Tony to help him build a bathroom for his guest house.There is much more to this movie, in fact this film has many layers.  There are myriad elements in this movie that makes it a notch above your average comedy-drama/dark comedy.  This movie reminds me of ""American Beauty (Widescreen Edition)"" and ""Life as a House (New Line Platinum Series)"", not because it has the same story of either film.  In contrast, it has same depth of both films, the ability to promote a smile and a tear.  I am really shocked this movie didn't get a wide release; I think it would have done very well.  It appears nowadays real films are classified as ""art films"" or ""independent films"", meanwhile the mainstream is filled with lousy remakes, CGI mind numbing drivel and the occasional good flick.  I think this is an amazing movie and one to not be missed. The story, directing, writing, cinematography and acting are marvelous!

Highly recommended.",5,It Blew The Summer Blockbusters Out Of The Water!,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,736,"['was', '18', 'hr', 'flight', 'Asia', 'last', 'October', 'were', 'dozen', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'playing-', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'same', 'movie', '3', 'times', 'now', 'Enough', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Huh', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'Zzzzzzzzzzz', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Gladiator', 'England', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', '2', 'WTF', 'Stoo-pid', 'bunch', 'more', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'desperate', 'stay', 'awake', 'pretty', 'impossible', 'sleep', 'trans-oceanic', 'flights.This', 'movie', 'was', 'answer', 'prayer', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'never', 'heard', 'once', 'got', 'started', 'got', 'hooked', 'Very', 'funny', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'very', 'fresh', 'original', 'Cyrus', 'small', 'movie', 'were', 'only', 'ones', 'kept', 'awake', 'Great', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'casting', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
