They managed to get to the Canadian Embassy and find a secret refuge there. The movie follows the chronicle of the CIA's plan to get them out of there alive and that's where the suspense lies.

In order to gain access to Iran and credibility with the fanatics, Mendez uses his hollywood contacts with the help of Lester Siegel, a film producer and John Chambers, a makeup artist to create a fake science fiction film production. A production that will certainly seem believable, so a fake science fiction film is concocted with the name Argo.Argo creates tension at the right places and is evenly paced.

For that endeavor, the CIA sent an exfiltration expert, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, who is very good and who also directed). After conventional escape plans were explored and looked like they wouldn't work out, Mendez thought up a bizarre plan: go to Iran and leave with the six diplomats pretending that they belong to a Canadian film crew planning to film a B type Sci Fi film named Argo in Iran. To give credibility to the story, Mendez had two film producers (played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin) set up an office in Hollywood as if the planned movie was for real. Surprisingly, the ploy worked (since this story is public knowledge, I don't think saying this is much of a spoiler).Great recreation of an era and a place (Istanbul and Los Angeles are a believable stand-in for Tehran, along with some digital graphics playing the mountains in the background). Interesting and gripping throughout, even if some details were obviously added for dramatic effect (almost certainly the Iranians didn't chase the leaving plane in the runway).

I had yet to see `Argo' but I was wholly convinced that Affleck and the film were going all the way with Oscar.  It just seemed like his time.  The film wound up winning the big award, but Affleck obviously couldn't win for Best Director.  Having seen the film now, I can understand why the directors branch didn't nominate Affleck (of his three films this is the more conventional and awards friendly but it is also the least inspired from a directorial perspective).  Can't say that I understand why this film swept through the awards season though.That isn't to say that `Argo' isn't a good film.  It's a fine film, but it's just that...a fine film.  It's rather generic and formulaic and it doesn't really do anything new or special.  The intensity that is carried through in certain scenes carries an air of staginess that doesn't truly lift the film.  In fact, Affleck held better form in both his previous efforts, and while he utilized his editor to better effect than in his previous films (whose primary faults were that they were too long) he failed to build something that felt fresh.Based on actual events, `Argo' is a thriller that chronicles a covert operation to rescue six American's who are hiding out in Iran after the American Embassy was taken hostage by Iranian fanatics.  Tony Mendez, CIA operative, is asked to find a way to get the six out of Iran.  Coming up with the `best bad idea' possible, Tony enlists the help of Hollywood to help him fake a movie as a disguise to sneak the American's out of the country.The look and feel of the film is pretty great.  I loved the way they completely recaptured old Hollywood, from the costumes to the sets.  The dialog is sharp and moves the film along really well (even if it feels forced in parts) and the performances, while none extraordinary, are uniformly fine.  Arkin is funny, Cranston is hard edged (until he gets all paranoid and starts to growl at everyone) and Victor Garber makes everything better.  Affleck is in fine form, and the rousing finale almost had me in tears.  I can see why AMPAS loved this, for it is a very good film, but I don't think I'll be thinking about this much in a few months.  It's just kind of there; a good film and serves a purpose and then leaves you.

Without giving away too much, I call this a rare jewel of a film because, it is one of the most heart pounding thrillers in years, and contains almost no action.  How did the filmmakers of 'Argo' achieve this?  A good question.  This is a very rare feat indeed.Credit must go to Ben Affleck of course.  What a Director this fellow is.  He manages to draw the viewer into a situation where the viewer feels the helplessness of the individuals, and pulls them into the question of whether these people will escape, never once offering any suggestion of whether they will.  It isn't easy to craft a film where the viewer is forced to feel sympathy with the subjects of the film in question - Ben Affleck ensures we live every moment with these people.I said in the subject title of this film this is one of the best thrillers in years.  I say this because, at roughly the halfway mark of this movie, the tension starts, and I felt my heart thumping out of my chest ; this continued for the remainder of the film, through to the movie's staggering climax.  1 hour!  I can't recall a recent thriller that has held such tension at such high levels, for such a large portion of the movie.  Normally your typical film, even your great ones, have the character development, and middle section, and (if they're lucky), a great climax.  'Argo' quickly tells us the story as development, to draw us in, and then rapidly focuses straight on the subjects of the film in question and offers the viewer the question (without any answers) of 'how can they escape?'The film is also quite funny.  John Goodman and Alan Arkin have some great dialogue and are natural comedians.  Those scenes are always with just the right amount of 'funny' though - not to distract us from the situation the subjects of the film find themselves in.I haven't seen ""Lincoln"" yet but, it would be a just result if Argo took away the Best Picture Oscar (if 'Lincoln' doesn't).  I say this because the other nominees, while great, are just films that you see made any given year - a good drama here and there.  I think Argo deserves the nod because it achieves something that hasn't been seen in years - a heart pounding thriller that manages this with no action.  Such a rare commodity, and as such, should be awarded the highest of accolades I believe.

1500728,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B005S9ELM6,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[0, 1]","I'll admit, when I first saw that the film Argo was ""based on a declassified true story"", my expectations fell slightly.  Even leaving aside films that clearly aren't actually ""true stories"" (sorry, Haunting in Connecticut), Hollywood very rarely produces films that are true to real events.  I was somewhat skeptical that this one would be any different, but I was happily proven wrong.The historical backdrop for the film is late 1979 and early 1980, during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, and we're immediately immersed in the time period.  Stock footage is used to great effect early on, and ropes you into the film's setting instantly.  Given the `80's were not that long ago, the ability to recreate them may not immediately impress every viewer, but the sheer dedication to recreating the world of a generation ago is amazing.  The paranoia of the Cold War is still clearly felt, and the news reels from the era drip with frustration with at the impotency of the Carter administration.The story focuses not on the hostages in the embassy, but on a footnote in the history books: six Americans managed to escape to the streets before the embassy was overrun, and took shelter at the Canadian ambassador's house.  The difficulty is extracting them from the country before the Iranian militants discover them.  The plot moves at a brisk clip, never staying in one place too long, as we meet the people responsible for getting them out:  Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is a CIA agent brought in to consult the State Department on how to deal with the situation.  Despite his skill and experience, he gives little chance of success for the default plans the State Department has come up with, the main one being to simply give the six refugees bikes and pray they make it the 300 miles to the border.With the help of Jack O'Donnell (Played by Bryan Cranston), Mendez puts together what sounds like an outrageous plan: extract the refugees under the pretense of being a film crew scouting locations for a science-fiction film.  With the help of John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to provide the Hollywood credibility, Mendez sets to work getting his ""film"" ready to go.  There's a very appealing tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Hollywood here, depicting most filmmakers as artists either compelled or outright eager to sell-out to the system for a bit more cash.  Given Affleck is a fairly big person in Hollywood, it's hard to tell if he meant for this to be satire, or just a playful elbow at his colleagues, but it's appealing nonetheless.The actors put in solid, but unmemorable performances, with Goodman and Cranston doing most of the heavy lifting.  The real focus here is on the story itself, which is told with appealing restraint.Argo is a very believable political thriller, replacing bombs and countdown timers with people who are simply very scared and just want to get home.  Given how complicated the politics were at the time, it's a credit to the film that it doesn't point fingers.  To do otherwise would take away from the fact that this is really just a film about human ingenuity and decency.  I highly recommend it.",4,Walter White vs. the CIA,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,3161,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'Argo', 'was', 'based', 'declassified', 'true', 'story', 'expectations', 'fell', 'slightly', 'Even', 'leaving', 'aside', 'films', 'clearly', 'are', ""n't"", 'actually', 'true', 'stories', 'sorry', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'Hollywood', 'very', 'rarely', 'films', 'are', 'true', 'real', 'events', 'was', 'somewhat', 'skeptical', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'was', 'happily', 'proven', 'wrong.The', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'film', 'late', '1979', 'early', '1980', 'Iranian', 'Hostage', 'Crisis', ""'re"", 'immediately', 'immersed', 'time', 'period', 'Stock', 'footage', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'early', 'film', 'setting', 'instantly', 'Given', '80', 'were', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'ability', 'recreate', 'may', 'not', 'immediately', 'impress', 'viewer', 'sheer', 'dedication', 'recreating', 'world', 'generation', 'ago', 'amazing', 'paranoia', 'Cold', 'War', 'still', 'clearly', 'felt', 'news', 'reels', 'era', 'drip', 'frustration', 'impotency', 'Carter', 'administration.The', 'story', 'not', 'hostages', 'embassy', 'footnote', 'history', 'books', 'six', 'Americans', 'managed', 'escape', 'streets', 'embassy', 'was', 'overrun', 'took', 'shelter', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'house', 'difficulty', 'extracting', 'country', 'Iranian', 'militants', 'discover', 'plot', 'moves', 'brisk', 'clip', 'never', 'staying', 'one', 'place', 'too', 'long', 'meet', 'people', 'responsible', 'getting', 'out', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'played', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'CIA', 'agent', 'brought', 'consult', 'State', 'Department', 'how', 'deal', 'situation', 'skill', 'experience', 'little', 'chance', 'success', 'default', 'State', 'Department', 'come', 'up', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'simply', 'give', 'six', 'refugees', 'bikes', 'pray', 'make', '300', 'miles', 'border.With', 'help', 'Jack', ""O'Donnell"", 'Played', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Mendez', 'together', 'what', 'outrageous', 'plan', 'extract', 'refugees', 'pretense', 'being', 'film', 'crew', 'scouting', 'locations', 'science-fiction', 'film', 'help', 'John', 'Chambers', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'provide', 'Hollywood', 'credibility', 'Mendez', 'work', 'getting', 'film', 'ready', 'go', 'very', 'appealing', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'portrayal', 'Hollywood', 'here', 'depicting', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'artists', 'compelled', 'outright', 'eager', 'sell-out', 'system', 'bit', 'more', 'cash', 'Given', 'Affleck', 'fairly', 'big', 'person', 'Hollywood', 'hard', 'tell', 'meant', 'be', 'satire', 'just', 'playful', 'elbow', 'colleagues', 'appealing', 'nonetheless.The', 'actors', 'put', 'solid', 'unmemorable', 'performances', 'Goodman', 'Cranston', 'doing', 'most', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'real', 'focus', 'here', 'story', 'told', 'appealing', 'restraint.Argo', 'very', 'believable', 'political', 'thriller', 'replacing', 'bombs', 'countdown', 'timers', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'very', 'scared', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'home', 'Given', 'how', 'complicated', 'politics', 'were', 'time', 'credit', 'film', ""n't"", 'point', 'fingers', 'do', 'otherwise', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'really', 'just', 'film', 'human', 'ingenuity', 'decency', 'highly', 'recommend']",Argo

1500737,A35HMLOGI89BG,B005S9ELM6,AvgMom2,"[1, 1]","I watched this movie with my family and we all LOVED it!  It's a movie version of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.  I remember that event very well, having lived through that period.  Critics have complained that Ben Afflect demonized the Iranian people in this movie.  I disagree.  I thought he did a pretty accurate picture of the people in Tehran at that time.  The Iranian people's anger at the U.S. for allowing their former King, the Shah of Iran, to be in our country for medical reason came through the nightly news exactly as shown.  (Of course, the Iranian people had their reason for being angry with the Shah, but that's another story.)Ben Afflect did a wonderful job directing this movie.  The script moved and the casting was great, but keep in mind that this is a movie.  The concept of creating a fake movie to be carried out by the CIA agent, Tony Mendez (Ben Afflect), was real.  All the other stuff (i.e. procuring the passports at the last minute, the airport chase, etc, etc) never happened.  But it made for a good thriller and kept us at the edge of our seats!  This DVD also has a special feature with the REAL 1979 hostages alongside the actors recalling their experiences.  It was fun to see them side-by-side.This covert operation was classified until much later when the information was released to the public and was picked up Joshua Bearman from the WIRED magazine in 2007.  We now know that we owe our gratitude for the safe return of the American hostages to Tony Mendez and to the courageous people who worked in the Canadian Embassy in Iran.  This movie does not take away from that fact.I read in the news that the CURRENT Iranian government is considering suing Argo for making them look bad.  If they want to sue anyone for making them look bad, then they need to sue themselves.  Most of the Iranian people are intelligent, kind, and hard working.  They are not all religious fanatics.  (I know this for a fact.)  This movie just showed the event and the mood of that period, nothing more.",5,Tony Mendez - our GREAT American Hero!,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,2027,"['watched', 'movie', 'family', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'version', '1979', 'Iranian', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'remember', 'event', 'very', 'well', 'having', 'lived', 'period', 'Critics', 'have', 'complained', 'Ben', 'Afflect', 'demonized', 'Iranian', 'people', 'movie', 'disagree', 'thought', 'did', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'picture', 'people', 'Tehran', 'time', 'Iranian', 'people', 'anger', 'U.S.', 'allowing', 'former', 'King', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'be', 'country', 'medical', 'reason', 'came', 'nightly', 'news', 'exactly', 'shown', 'course', 'Iranian', 'people', 'had', 'reason', 'being', 'angry', 'Shah', 'story', 'Ben', 'Afflect', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'script', 'moved', 'casting', 'was', 'great', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'concept', 'creating', 'fake', 'movie', 'be', 'carried', 'out', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'Ben', 'Afflect', 'was', 'real', 'other', 'stuff', 'i.e', 'procuring', 'passports', 'last', 'minute', 'airport', 'chase', 'etc', 'etc', 'never', 'happened', 'made', 'good', 'thriller', 'kept', 'edge', 'seats', 'DVD', 'also', 'special', 'feature', 'REAL', '1979', 'hostages', 'alongside', 'actors', 'recalling', 'experiences', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'side-by-side.This', 'covert', 'operation', 'was', 'classified', 'much', 'later', 'when', 'information', 'was', 'released', 'public', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'Joshua', 'Bearman', 'WIRED', 'magazine', '2007', 'now', 'know', 'owe', 'gratitude', 'safe', 'return', 'American', 'hostages', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'courageous', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Canadian', 'Embassy', 'Iran', 'movie', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'fact.I', 'read', 'news', 'CURRENT', 'Iranian', 'government', 'considering', 'suing', 'Argo', 'making', 'look', 'bad', 'want', 'sue', 'anyone', 'making', 'look', 'bad', 'then', 'need', 'sue', 'Most', 'Iranian', 'people', 'are', 'intelligent', 'kind', 'hard', 'working', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'know', 'fact', 'movie', 'just', 'showed', 'event', 'mood', 'period', 'nothing', 'more']",Argo

A masterful job telling an incredible story that I (among many other people) never even knew about. It's an incredible story. One that many would assume was Hollywood fiction because it's so crazy. But it's real, and it makes for one heck of a movie.""Argo"" takes place between 1979/1980, and deals with the Iranian hostage crisis. When the American embassy is stormed, 52 Americans were taken hostage, but six lucky ones were able to escape. They find a safe haven in the home of the canadian ambassador (played by Victor Garber). An amazing scheme is concocted between the CIA and Hollywood to get the six out and back to America. Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is sent in to get the 6 safely out, posing as a Canadian film crew who were just in town to scout locations for a fake up and coming science fiction movie called 'Argo'. Mendez gets the help from Film Producer Lester (Alan Arkin), and make-up man John Chambers (John Goodman).I didn't know this story previous to the movie, so I am not going to pretend I know all the history or what they got right or got wrong. Although, one senses that the breathtaking climax with the plane may of been 'Hollywood'. Still, what we have here is a great film. Even if you already knew the story, knew how it ends, it doesn't make the movie any less suspenseful, tense, and entertaining. That's the mark of good writing and direction, both of which is exceptional. As director, Affleck solidly sets up the situation and lets the tension build. You are as tense as they are on the screen. Like I said, I haven't seen Affleck's past directorial efforts, so I can't compare his directing or style here. I just know that he shows immense skill behind the camera, and that I will be interested in seeing where he goes from here.Cast-wise, this is a good one and there is great work here. Even though this is a real showcase for Affleck as a filmmaker, his cast runs circles around him. Affleck (taller, thinner, and better looking than the real Mendez. Hollywood!) is there to get the proceedings going. Nothing splashy. However, his Hollywood partners, Alan Arkin and John Goodman, steal the show and every scene they are in. I would go see a movie with just those two characters in 70s-80s Hollywood. They are perfectly cast in their roles and Arkin is deserving of his Oscar nomination. Bryan Cranston is very good (and Oscar-worthy in my opinion). The movie has a number of appearances from familiar faces - Adrienne Barbeau, Kyle Chandler, Bob Gunton, Philip Baker Hall, and Tate Donovan as one of the six hostages. This really feels more like an ensemble piece than a Ben Affleck starring vehicle, and everyone here shines.""Argo"" gets the detail of the era down well too. The clothing, hair, etc. I personally loved the detail of Affleck's sons room. The posters and action figures. It wonderfully cuts in real footage of the crisis as well as vintage news clips. It's a hoot seeing a young Tom Brokaw, Ted Koppell and others.The movie is just sensational. Normally, I see these big Oscar movies after the fact. I'm glad I saw this one before the show. ""Argo"" is great filmmaking that is deserving of every accolade it gets. Not only is it suspenseful, dramatic and tense, but it is also genuinely funny in places too. It's a movie that is both hailed by critics and general movie going audiences alike and Oscar. Those don't come too often anymore.

I'm aware of the situation involving 6 Americans being held hostage in the late 70's by the Iranian hostage crisis, but what I either didn't know or what is most likely false for the sake of Hollywood movie writing exaggeration, are the segments about film making concerning science fiction and in particular, Planet of the Apes, robots and aliens.  This portion of the movie -which incidentally dominates the entire first half- was really hard to understand.  Totally downright confusing, in fact.  Its inclusion is really perplexing and odd.  I certainly don't remember reading about any of *this* in the history books, haha.  Argo makes viewers unsure if they're supposed to learn about a real incident that took place, or take the entire movie as tongue in cheek.  At least we don't actually SEE aliens and robots.  Imagine how unbelievably awkward that would have been.At least it begins to make sense near the end when the group of Americans disguise themselves as Canadians to try and rescue the 6 American hostages.  That makes sense.  Nice touch when the group learns about Canada enough to make their Canadian portrayal seem believable.  Not sure how much of this film is total exaggeration though- that's the biggest problem I have with the film.  I don't like being played a fool trying and figure out what is realistic and what is not, of course.  If this is supposed to be some kind of sophisticated version of Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by combining reality with fantasy, please Hollywood, go away forever.The biggest problem however, is that Argo never even tries to be captivating or tell an interesting story.  Instead it goes for short bits of information that goes by without any suspense or drama, and makes the entire movie feel more like a news broadcast. That kills any momentum the movie tries to build right there, and makes Argo an incredibly overrated movie.  Not worthy of all the accolades it has won over the year.  It's only regarded so highly because of the many big name actors and actresses that star in it.",1,went completely over my head,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,2070,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Argo', ""'m"", 'aware', 'situation', 'involving', '6', 'Americans', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'late', '70', 'Iranian', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'most', 'likely', 'false', 'sake', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'writing', 'exaggeration', 'are', 'segments', 'film', 'making', 'concerning', 'science', 'fiction', 'particular', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'robots', 'aliens', 'portion', 'movie', '-which', 'incidentally', 'entire', 'first', 'half-', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'understand', 'Totally', 'downright', 'confusing', 'fact', 'inclusion', 'really', 'perplexing', 'odd', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'reading', '*this*', 'history', 'books', 'haha', 'Argo', 'viewers', 'unsure', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'learn', 'real', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'take', 'entire', 'movie', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'SEE', 'aliens', 'robots', 'Imagine', 'how', 'unbelievably', 'would', 'have', 'been.At', 'least', 'make', 'sense', 'end', 'when', 'group', 'Americans', 'disguise', 'Canadians', 'try', 'rescue', '6', 'American', 'hostages', 'sense', 'Nice', 'touch', 'when', 'group', 'Canada', 'enough', 'make', 'Canadian', 'portrayal', 'seem', 'believable', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'total', 'exaggeration', 'though-', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'played', 'fool', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'realistic', 'what', 'not', 'course', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'sophisticated', 'version', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'combining', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'please', 'Hollywood', 'go', 'away', 'forever.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'however', 'Argo', 'never', 'even', 'be', 'captivating', 'tell', 'interesting', 'story', 'Instead', 'short', 'bits', 'information', 'suspense', 'drama', 'entire', 'movie', 'feel', 'more', 'news', 'broadcast', 'momentum', 'movie', 'build', 'right', 'there', 'Argo', 'incredibly', 'overrated', 'movie', 'Not', 'worthy', 'accolades', 'won', 'year', 'only', 'regarded', 'so', 'highly', 'many', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'actresses', 'star']",Argo

As a result, the movie is terribly boring. The true story is much more interesting. If all the fabricated dramas were cut out leaving only the true story behind, the movie would have been a lot more authentic and believable.

1500777,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B005S9ELM6,Blago Jones,"[0, 0]","Why you shouldn't see it:The strength of Argo also happens to be its weakness. More so than a lot of modern Hollywood fare, this is a film about its story, and that story is about people in a not envious situation. It has been branded as a ""thriller,"" but despite a riot at the beginning and some brief ""action"" at the end, the majority of this movie's ""thrills"" and plot advancement are presented in the form of dialog and tense expressions. Accordingly, if you aren't one to care about the story of a hostage crisis in the early 80's, you probably won't care about this movie, since there isn't much in the way of real exciting set pieces or even off-color moments to take your mind off of the tension of it all.As I'm sure you're aware, Argo is based on true events. I can't speak for everyone, but movies that are supposed to have any relation to true events can make me uncomfortable. Did you know that Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Silence of the Lambs were both ""inspired by"" the same events? I'm a big fan of getting things right if you're going to try to tackle actual history, or you may as well just make up your own story and let it succeed (Silence of the Lambs) or fail (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) on its own merits. I can't speak for the veracity of any of these true events, since they're based on a top secret operation that no one even knew about until 20 years after it happened. Even now most people just remember the events surrounding this movie and not the events of the movie itself. That can be a smart move by a filmmaker, as it means you can tell the story how you think it needs to be told. On the other hand, it can be a risk, because you're telling a story about which no one necessarily cares.Why you should see it:Ben Affleck. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""Blake, I've seen Ben Affleck, and I've seen enough Ben Affleck."" Well you're kind of missing the point. Honestly, he does a fine job acting in Argo, though I wouldn't say his work is anything special. But did you know that Affleck also directs movies? He has only directed two movies (Gone Baby Gone and The Town) previous to this one, but I wouldn't rate either of them below ""very good,"" and this one follows in their quality footsteps.I just finished saying that Argo is about very little other than its story about people talking about a stressful situation. To further complicate the task for the filmmaker, everyone already knows how the story ends. And yet, despite these handicaps, Affleck somehow makes a suspenseful movie! There was a woman next to me in the theater, saying things aloud to the screen, along the lines of, ""No, don't go through that door!"" It's hard to explain how exactly this suspense is pulled off, but I think it has mostly to do with skilled actors playing identifiable characters in intimate settings. When the embassy gets stormed, you feel like you're about to get blindfolded and gagged by the mob yourself. When Affleck's Mendes is talking to Cranston's O'Donnell about how six Americans are about to get lynched for no good reason (depending on your viewpoint, I guess), you feel like you're standing right there next to them.Speaking of Affleck and Cranston, it's possible I didn't give enough credit to the former earlier. The role of Mendes as a character is to be the steadying force for the rest of the characters and story, and he performs that role admirably. Because Affleck is able to pull this off, the character actors like Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin are able to present their own characters as the film's much needed engaging changes of pace. That being said, the highlights of the movie as far as entertainment factor goes are definitely those very same character actors. Their interplay with each other and Affleck is always worthy of screen time, and I spent a good deal of the movie waiting for the next time one of them would pop up.In Short:As you may remember me saying before, this movie isn't about anything more than a fairly straightforward story, so you're left at the end of it wondering in part what the point was. But I will say that the ability of the filmmakers to take a story that everyone knows the ending to and turn it into a suspense thriller is, well, impressive. Honestly, Ben Affleck as a capable storyteller doesn't come as a surprise, as he has a - admittedly limited - pedigree of making quality films. To make this particular quality film, he successfully turns an otherwise straightforward story into one of entertaining and empathetic characters in a surprisingly suspenseful situation. As far as talking movies go, I rate this one as an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it for anyone who can appreciate a good historical suspense/thriller/drama.Exceptions to the recommendation:- if you have had too much Ben Affleck;- if you positively identify with revolutionary Iran;- if you have incredibly sensitive ears;- anyone for whom suspenseful situations lead to nothing more than stress and high blood pressure;- individuals who would like to go on thinking that the ""Canadian Caper"" was, in fact, Canadian;- if you prefer to keep Hollywood as far as possible away from your understanding of historical events;- people who would like to remain blissfully unaware that Ben Affleck is a worthwhile Hollywood type when placed safely behind the camera.",4,"Expertly Crafted, Standard Espionage

1500799,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B005S9ELM6,Brian Driver,"[0, 1]","I'm old enough to remember the hostage situation - the beginning of the 444 days of captivity of the ""other"" Americans who were unable to get out of the embassy - and how that situation was one of the causative elements that drove Jimmy Carter out of his Presidency, and Ronald Reagan in.And I, like most people on the planet, had never heard of the six who escaped.  Until now.I should alert you that while this is a thrilling movie, with tension you can cut like pieces of cake, it is not an action movie.  No car chases.  No precipitous cliffs.  No fisticuffs.  No sex.  Yet it will retain your attention as if all four were present, and much more.It's a dry production, with little fanfare, little glitz, and little showboating.  But it scores high on tension and focuses its energies on the realities of the situation, letting glances serve as bullets, and angry words serve as explosions.  You WILL be caught up in the tension and emotion by film's end.  And you'll laugh as well, when you least expect it.Part of the reason for the strengths in this film come from, of course, the actual situation.  One doesn't have to travel very far in time or location to picture a dense Muslim world with ugly Americans walking a tightrope in between our world and theirs.When a situation like this WAS foreign, in fact, was the 1970s, right before as all of this became everyday language to non political science majors.  To give you an idea, I was in London that very summer, in fact, in Hyde Park's ""Speakers' Corner"", when a group of angry protesters caught my eye.  They were marching within the park, gathering protesters by the minute, and I was fascinated by the situation.Being the optimistic airhead that I was, I walked over to the protesters to get a closer look.  I couldn't tell what their posters said, and even their flag--held with pride by several men and women--was foreign to me, so I began inspecting.BY the time I realized friends saw me, I puzzled over why they were so energetically waving at me and calling me over.  When I returned--to their relieved shouts--I began to realize it was my time to learn a little about the growing tension between our cultures.About this film: Not only is Affleck wonderful when it comes to directing this taut, suspenseful and economic thriller, but he is equally terrific as ""exfiltration expert"" Tony Mendez, the CIA man who came up with the daunting plan to fake a film project that was looking to shoot in Iran.  It was his job to import faked documents and distribute them, making sure to drill the six on the particulars of their new identity in order that not even the smallest mistake would befall them.Affleck supplies the movie with a steely resolve that typified what Mendez provided: for it was Mendez who was the backbone of the operation...it was his plan, his neck, his name, his character, his planning, that meant life or death to these six individuals.  His was not the only neck on the block, and those roles are also characterized well -- Bryan Cranston as his supervisor, Jack O'Donnell; Alan Arkin as film producer Lester Siegel; John Goodman as Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers; and rising star Scoot McNairy as Joe Stafford, the most vocal and skeptical member of the six Americans being rescued.  All of these roles -- and many others -- are handled skillfully.  They make it an intelligent -- and occasionally darkly funny -- escape movie.The movie has been nominated for scores of awards: it's up for seven Oscars, and has already won Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director at the Globes; it won Outstanding Cast Performance in  a Motion Picture as the 19th Screen Actors Guild Awards; and Best Film Best Edition, and Best Director at the British Academy Film Awards; and well over a dozen other awards by major film societies across the country.The movie came about after the information concerning the rescue became declassified, and in 2007 published an article entitled ""How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick To Rescue Americans from Tehran."" forWired (1-year auto-renewal)magazine.

After all it was faked by the CIA to try and get six hostages in Iran out of the country.  For those that didn't live it, it was a time fraught with tension and high anxiety.  The eighty plus other hostages weren't so lucky, nor were their families.  Those hostages endured horrible conditions and treatment for over a year before their release.  This movie centers around an agent that came up with the daring plan to get a handful of hostages out.  It would not have even stood a chance if the Canadians had not been so brave that they had taken them into their embassy during the American embassy takeover.Ben Afleck did a great job in producing, directing, and acting in this movie.  His excellent support cast, locations, camera work, and music make it a memorable drama.  I am glad the story was finally declassified and was made into a movie.

1500825,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B005S9ELM6,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 4]","I agree that Ben Affleck is proving himself as a director to be reckoned with in the years ahead. This isn't as surprising as one might at first think.  Affleck has already won the Oscar as a writer, not as an actor.  The public, however, knows him best as an actor (and as the disastrous romantic counterpart to J-Lo in earlier years).  It is not at all unusual for a writer to move into directing because he already understands how to move a story forward conceptually, visually, thematically and technically.  I personally preferred his earlier film as director, GONE BABY GONE, because he had his brother play the leading man.  I think Casey is the better actor of the two of them.  When they work together they are an unbeatable combination and five stars all the way. If you have not seen that film, see that one first.So although this movie is very good, I doubt if it is the best one we will see from Affleck. He does an ok job as the leading man, a CIA operative who extricates people from places. The best part of the movie is his crackpot idea to call hostages in Iran part of a film crew from Canada and extract them from Iran on that basis.  In order to do this he has to go to Hollywood, get a producer, a script and so forth.  Alan Arkin and John Goodman help him put it together as his producers.  Those two are the best part of the movie, especially Alan Arkin, who works fiercely to make it a go deal.There are problems doing the extraction of course and Affleck gets overly get caught up in chase scene gimmicks.  But all in all this film is very good but if it wins the Oscar, as is being noised about, then I can only conclude it is a year weak in feature films.",4,Ben Affleck stays the course as a director,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,1683,"['agree', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'proving', 'director', 'be', 'reckoned', 'years', 'ahead', ""n't"", 'as', 'surprising', 'one', 'might', 'first', 'think', 'Affleck', 'already', 'won', 'Oscar', 'writer', 'not', 'actor', 'public', 'however', 'best', 'actor', 'disastrous', 'romantic', 'counterpart', 'J-Lo', 'earlier', 'years', 'not', 'unusual', 'writer', 'move', 'directing', 'already', 'how', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'conceptually', 'visually', 'thematically', 'technically', 'personally', 'preferred', 'earlier', 'film', 'director', 'GONE', 'BABY', 'GONE', 'had', 'brother', 'play', 'leading', 'man', 'think', 'Casey', 'better', 'actor', 'two', 'When', 'work', 'together', 'are', 'unbeatable', 'combination', 'five', 'stars', 'way', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'see', 'one', 'first.So', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'doubt', 'best', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'Affleck', 'ok', 'job', 'leading', 'man', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'people', 'places', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'crackpot', 'idea', 'call', 'hostages', 'Iran', 'part', 'film', 'crew', 'Canada', 'extract', 'Iran', 'basis', 'order', 'do', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'get', 'producer', 'script', 'so', 'forth', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'John', 'Goodman', 'put', 'together', 'producers', 'two', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'especially', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'fiercely', 'make', 'go', 'deal.There', 'are', 'problems', 'doing', 'extraction', 'course', 'Affleck', 'overly', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'chase', 'scene', 'gimmicks', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'Oscar', 'being', 'noised', 'then', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'year', 'weak', 'feature', 'films']",Argo

It is excellent entertainment based on real events which were finally de-classified by President Clinton. The story has been fictionalized for purposes of entertainment, dramatic effect, simplification of too many complex details but gives the viewer a great film with historic significance.  Ben Affleck co-produced, directed, and stars in this film and I certainly have an increased appreciation for his skills. He plays CIA agent Tony Mendez who is able to get 6 US embassy employees out of Iran in the early stages of the Islamic revolution that overthrew the Shah. The scenes of the revolutionary crowds invading the US embassy are hair-raising. These 6 individuals found shelter in the home of the Canadian ambassador.  He and his wife were incredibly brave souls to risk their lives in such a way. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are superb as Hollywood veteran film-makers who assist in the charade that must be constructed to convince the Iranians that a Canadian film crew has come to Iran to scout out the locations of a science fiction film. Akin and Goodman have the best lines in the film and offer great comic relief throughout this intense drama. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan are also portrayed for the roles they took in this drama. There are so many films being made today with completely over-the-top computer generated special effects and yet this film succeeds wildly by using the time proven strategies of character development and identification, increased tension with primary characters overcoming one barrier after another, and periodic breaking of the tension with comic relief.  However in this film it kept me on the edge of my seat until the final minutes. It is great entertainment and is highly recommended.",5,This historic thriller deserves ten stars,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1840,"['could', 'give', 'movie', '10', 'stars', 'certainly', 'would', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'were', 'finally', 'de-classified', 'President', 'Clinton', 'story', 'been', 'fictionalized', 'purposes', 'entertainment', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'simplification', 'too', 'many', 'complex', 'details', 'viewer', 'great', 'film', 'historic', 'significance', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'co-produced', 'directed', 'stars', 'film', 'certainly', 'have', 'increased', 'appreciation', 'skills', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'who', 'able', 'get', '6', 'US', 'embassy', 'employees', 'Iran', 'early', 'stages', 'Islamic', 'revolution', 'overthrew', 'Shah', 'scenes', 'revolutionary', 'crowds', 'invading', 'US', 'embassy', 'are', 'hair-raising', '6', 'individuals', 'found', 'shelter', 'home', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'wife', 'were', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'souls', 'risk', 'lives', 'such', 'way', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'John', 'Goodman', 'are', 'superb', 'Hollywood', 'veteran', 'film-makers', 'who', 'assist', 'charade', 'must', 'be', 'constructed', 'convince', 'Iranians', 'Canadian', 'film', 'crew', 'come', 'Iran', 'scout', 'out', 'locations', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Akin', 'Goodman', 'have', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'offer', 'great', 'comic', 'relief', 'intense', 'drama', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Cyrus', 'Vance', 'White', 'House', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Hamilton', 'Jordan', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'roles', 'took', 'drama', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'completely', 'over-the-top', 'computer', 'generated', 'special', 'effects', 'yet', 'film', 'wildly', 'using', 'time', 'proven', 'strategies', 'character', 'development', 'identification', 'increased', 'tension', 'primary', 'characters', 'overcoming', 'one', 'barrier', 'periodic', 'breaking', 'tension', 'comic', 'relief', 'However', 'film', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'final', 'minutes', 'great', 'entertainment', 'highly', 'recommended']",Argo

The militants took 52 American hostages but 6 of them managed to get out a back exit and make their way to the Canadian embassy. In the Canadian embassy, they were also imprisoned, in a way. Although they were safe in the embassy for the time being, the entire nation of Iran was in chaos and they were lashing out at Americans. It wasn't safe to leave and getting out of the country was nearly impossible. Their days in the embassy were numbered and the American government knew they had to act fast to save them.""Argo"" is based on an improbable but true story that was classified for years until 1996 when President Bill Clinton declassified it. Faced with impossible odds, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA officer, was brought into a meeting to discuss how to rescue them. As was described in the film, Mendez came up with the best bad idea they could up with. It didn't occur right away, but the idea was to go through all the actions of a potential moving filming in Iran and fake the hostages as members of the crew scouting out a location to film. Helping him was a Hollywood makeup artist named John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin).Ben Affleck directed and starred in the film, not unlike he did with the movie ""The Town. Affleck also directed his brother in ""Gone Baby Gone"". Both movies received critical acclaim and Affleck's ""Argo"" will most certainly follow suit. The authenticity of the film is to be heralded. Affleck, in order to achieve the look on screen that a 1979 incident would look like, Affleck shot the movie on old film and zoomed in on the reel in order to increase the graininess. With the costuming, settings and recreations of the Iranian revolution, Affleck may have achieving the most amazing effect of his career. It takes you back to that time, whether you remember it or not.Unfortunately, in order to ramp up the tension and drama, Affleck resorted to some typical old Hollywood gimmicks that seemed odd in a historical reenactment. Whether or not Jimmy Carter and the officials stateside reissued the tickets at the last second, as depicted in the film, I don't know, but it sure seemed contrived. This wasn't the only one either. In fact, it happened multiple times. Phones ringing and if that person doesn't answer, the entire operation is dead, but their held up by a studio lot film shoot and don't know the phone is ringing. All was there to ramp up the tension and I guess it worked because the movie worked.""Argo"" is not a nail biter grit your teeth suspense movie as some have promoted. Had the dangerousness of the Iranian guards been ramped up a bit more, maybe it would have been. Although, you are aware of what they're facing just because we're living it in our current life, but I think the film was too soft on ramping this up, possibly not to offend a culture that doesn't like being offended. The movie is though, an incredibly authentic look into a part of history that remained untold until 1996 and untold widely until now.",4,GOOD not GREAT... suspense hollywoodized to make more of an impact,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,3130,"['1979', 'republic', 'Iran', 'erupted', 'revolution', 'Islamic', 'militants', 'stormed', 'took', 'over', 'U.S.', 'embassy', 'Tehran', 'militants', 'took', '52', 'American', 'hostages', '6', 'managed', 'get', 'out', 'back', 'exit', 'make', 'way', 'Canadian', 'embassy', 'Canadian', 'embassy', 'were', 'also', 'imprisoned', 'way', 'were', 'safe', 'embassy', 'time', 'being', 'entire', 'nation', 'Iran', 'was', 'chaos', 'were', 'lashing', 'out', 'Americans', 'was', ""n't"", 'safe', 'leave', 'getting', 'country', 'was', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'days', 'embassy', 'were', 'numbered', 'American', 'government', 'knew', 'had', 'act', 'fast', 'save', 'Argo', 'based', 'improbable', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'classified', 'years', '1996', 'when', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'declassified', 'Faced', 'impossible', 'odds', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'CIA', 'officer', 'was', 'brought', 'meeting', 'discuss', 'how', 'rescue', 'was', 'described', 'film', 'Mendez', 'came', 'up', 'best', 'bad', 'idea', 'could', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'right', 'away', 'idea', 'was', 'go', 'actions', 'potential', 'moving', 'filming', 'Iran', 'fake', 'hostages', 'members', 'crew', 'scouting', 'out', 'location', 'film', 'Helping', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'makeup', 'artist', 'named', 'John', 'Chambers', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'Alan', 'Arkin', '.Ben', 'Affleck', 'directed', 'starred', 'film', 'not', 'did', 'movie', 'Town', 'Affleck', 'also', 'directed', 'brother', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'movies', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'Affleck', 'Argo', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'follow', 'suit', 'authenticity', 'film', 'be', 'heralded', 'Affleck', 'order', 'achieve', 'look', 'screen', '1979', 'incident', 'would', 'look', 'Affleck', 'shot', 'movie', 'old', 'film', 'zoomed', 'reel', 'order', 'increase', 'graininess', 'costuming', 'settings', 'recreations', 'Iranian', 'revolution', 'Affleck', 'may', 'have', 'achieving', 'most', 'amazing', 'effect', 'career', 'back', 'time', 'remember', 'not.Unfortunately', 'order', 'ramp', 'up', 'tension', 'drama', 'Affleck', 'resorted', 'typical', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'gimmicks', 'seemed', 'odd', 'historical', 'reenactment', 'not', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'officials', 'stateside', 'reissued', 'tickets', 'last', 'second', 'depicted', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'fact', 'happened', 'multiple', 'times', 'Phones', 'ringing', 'person', ""n't"", 'answer', 'entire', 'operation', 'dead', 'held', 'up', 'studio', 'lot', 'film', 'shoot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'phone', 'ringing', 'was', 'there', 'ramp', 'up', 'tension', 'guess', 'worked', 'movie', 'worked', 'Argo', 'not', 'nail', 'biter', 'grit', 'teeth', 'suspense', 'movie', 'have', 'promoted', 'Had', 'dangerousness', 'Iranian', 'guards', 'been', 'ramped', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'facing', 'just', ""'re"", 'living', 'current', 'life', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'soft', 'ramping', 'up', 'possibly', 'not', 'offend', 'culture', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'offended', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'authentic', 'look', 'part', 'history', 'remained', 'untold', '1996', 'untold', 'widely', 'now']",Argo

I love period pieces that happen in our recent past, a time that I can vaguely recall, because it invokes a sense of nostalgia. Argo takes place at the end of 1979 and the beginning of 1980 when Iran had their revolution and removed the Shah that the U.S. put in place with a ruler of their own choosing. Iran was extremely upset with the U.S. and U.K. because they believed we were exporting their oil and leaving them a ruler who cared only for his own lavish lifestyle and nothing for the poor that composed the majority of the country. The movie sheds light on our current problems with Iran and the bitter animosity their people holds for our country.The movie begins with Iranians overrunning the U.S. embassy and taking hostage most of the works but 5 were able to flee and hide in the Canadian embassy.

Don't get me wrong - I think it is a fine film with some impressive aspects, chief among them the recreation of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran and the street scenes within Tehran, which is a city that few Americans ever see.  But I wouldn't rank it among the best films of the year, and I doubt that it will achieve the title of ""classic"".  Years from now, the film Argo will likely pale in comparison to other more substantial films, just as the events portrayed in Argo are but a footnote to the overall Iranian hostage crisis.There is a simple, plausible explanation for why Hollywood is so enamored with Argo: the Hollywood filmmaking industry plays a crucial role in the storyline, and it is a role in which Hollywood literally gets a chance to save the day (and lives) and have a direct influence on political events.  In other words, Hollywood (for once) gets a chance to do some unalloyed real-world good.  But the CIA and other spy organizations create many cover stories for their agents, and the one portrayed in Argo happens to be the best alternative for the circumstances, so I felt it to be fairly logical, all things considered.Like all movies that are ""based on a true story"", the filmmakers have a certain degree of freedom to enhance events to increase the drama, and my impression is that director Ben Affleck took advantage of that.  There are several scenes at the climax of the movie that are a bit hard to believe, two of which involve the incredibly fortunate simultaneous timing of events on opposite sides of the world, and a final chase sequence on an airport runway that is quite ludicrous.  If these events actually happened exactly as portrayed then I retract all these comments, but I think the odds are in my favor.Argo is worth a viewing if you are at all interested in the subject matter, and in particular if you can remember the Iranian hostage crisis, but don't expect it to make your list of all-time classics.",3,Hollywood navel gazing?,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,2016,"['Hollywood', 'definitely', 'Argo', 'more', 'do', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'think', 'fine', 'film', 'impressive', 'aspects', 'chief', 'recreation', 'takeover', 'U.S.', 'Embassy', 'Tehran', 'Iran', 'street', 'scenes', 'Tehran', 'city', 'few', 'Americans', 'ever', 'see', 'would', ""n't"", 'rank', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'doubt', 'will', 'achieve', 'title', 'classic', 'Years', 'now', 'film', 'Argo', 'will', 'likely', 'pale', 'comparison', 'other', 'more', 'substantial', 'films', 'just', 'events', 'portrayed', 'Argo', 'are', 'footnote', 'overall', 'Iranian', 'hostage', 'simple', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'enamored', 'Argo', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'industry', 'crucial', 'role', 'storyline', 'role', 'Hollywood', 'literally', 'chance', 'save', 'day', 'have', 'direct', 'influence', 'political', 'events', 'other', 'words', 'Hollywood', 'once', 'chance', 'do', 'unalloyed', 'real-world', 'good', 'CIA', 'other', 'spy', 'organizations', 'create', 'many', 'cover', 'stories', 'agents', 'one', 'portrayed', 'Argo', 'be', 'best', 'alternative', 'circumstances', 'felt', 'be', 'fairly', 'logical', 'things', 'considered.Like', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'certain', 'degree', 'freedom', 'enhance', 'events', 'increase', 'drama', 'impression', 'director', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'took', 'advantage', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'climax', 'movie', 'are', 'bit', 'hard', 'believe', 'two', 'involve', 'incredibly', 'fortunate', 'simultaneous', 'timing', 'events', 'opposite', 'sides', 'world', 'final', 'chase', 'sequence', 'airport', 'runway', 'quite', 'ludicrous', 'events', 'actually', 'happened', 'exactly', 'portrayed', 'then', 'retract', 'comments', 'think', 'odds', 'are', 'favor.Argo', 'viewing', 'are', 'interested', 'subject', 'matter', 'particular', 'can', 'remember', 'Iranian', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'make', 'list', 'all-time', 'classics']",Argo
1500885,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005S9ELM6,C. Sawin,"[20, 50]","""Argo f*** yourself."" You can go ahead and pack up your things; you've just experienced the most enjoyable part of Ben Affleck's ""Argo."" In all seriousness, ""Argo"" has the precise formula to be a sure fire Oscar winner. Affleck went to great lengths to make the film look aged and grainy while there were plenty of bad 70s hairstyles, bushy porn star moustaches, and unbuttoned shirts with huge collars that scream ""in case of emergency disco dancing pop up."" The camera work deserves some accolades, as well. Near the beginning of the film, there's a scene with a helicopter where you feel like you're riding right along with the pilot. The shot starts at ground level and then slowly shoots up into the air.The performances are pretty strong all around. Affleck portrays a man in purgatory; not only is he in charge of six people's lives but he's also separated from his wife who has custody of their son. Affleck's Tony Mendez character seems mostly emotionally absent the entire film and rightfully so. The six Americans stranded in Iran all portray panic and anxiousness very well. John Goodman as make-up effects artist John Chambers is fantastic as is Alan Arkin as movie director Lester Siegel. Goodman is funny and charming right from the start while Arkin has this no BS type of humor that comes with all his years in the movie business. His quick wit, particularly during the meeting him and Affleck have regarding the rights to ""Argo,"" instantly makes him the highlight of the film.Ever since Bryan Cranston became a household name in ""Breaking Bad,"" he's been popping up in a lot of movies; ""Red Tails,"" ""John Carter,"" ""Madagascar 3,"" ""Rock of Ages,"" ""Total Recall,"" and now ""Argo"" in 2012 alone. He usually brings that same intensity you love him for in ""Breaking Bad"" to every role he has even if the project he's a part of isn't very good. ""Argo"" may be his best effort film-wise so far. He's just so good as a man who has no other options; when his character is at the end of his rope. His form of frustrated panic is outstanding and thanks to the magic of R-rated films has a chance to be completely unfiltered here.What's disappointing about ""Argo"" is that it's really dull. Speaking as someone who isn't really interested in the subject matter of the film, any interest at all was solely based on the feedback it's received. Any scenes revolving around developing the fake movie and that include John Chambers or Lester Siegel are immediately entertaining, but that's obviously secondary. There's a lot of sitting around and waiting and drinking. How Tony Mendez drinks so much without showing any signs of feeling it is kind of astounding.Seeing the mechanics of it all as it's happening gets pretty redundant. There's this blue balls mentality to the film where it teases so many things that could happen but then they don't or it strings you along for so long and then is just like ""Oh, nevermind."" You can only watch people talking, having things go wrong, and them scrambling to figure out a last minute solution so many times before you figure out where things are headed. It really seems difficult having knowledge of the events the film is based on and how everything turns out and still being able to enjoy the film. It seems like knowing the answer to the riddle beforehand would make it less enjoyable.While ""Argo"" will more than likely be nominated for best picture at The Academy Awards that doesn't mean it's going to cater to everyone or that anyone who sees it is going to fall in love with it. If it wasn't for the performances of John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston, it would actually be pretty boring. How bad the fake sci-fi movie seems pulls you in more than the horrible events going on in Iran.Some moments are tense, but many are portraying it as this overwhelming sensation that never lets up during its two hour duration and that just isn't the case; whether or not you're interested in politics or the history surrounding the events of the film will play or big role in your enjoyment of the film itself. ""Argo"" may be a good film that was just viewed by someone who isn't its target audience, but in the meantime just seems like another Ben Affleck related project that's being over praised because of who's attached to it and its bureaucratic subject matter.",2,Tedious and kind of pretentious,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,4316,"['Argo', 'f***', 'can', 'go', 'ahead', 'pack', 'up', 'things', ""'ve"", 'just', 'experienced', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'part', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Argo', 'seriousness', 'Argo', 'precise', 'formula', 'be', 'sure', 'fire', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Affleck', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'aged', 'grainy', 'were', 'plenty', 'bad', '70s', 'hairstyles', 'bushy', 'porn', 'star', 'moustaches', 'unbuttoned', 'shirts', 'huge', 'collars', 'scream', 'case', 'emergency', 'disco', 'dancing', 'pop', 'up', 'camera', 'work', 'accolades', 'as', 'well', 'beginning', 'film', 'scene', 'helicopter', 'where', 'feel', ""'re"", 'riding', 'right', 'along', 'pilot', 'shot', 'ground', 'level', 'then', 'slowly', 'shoots', 'up', 'air.The', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'strong', 'around', 'Affleck', 'man', 'purgatory', 'not', 'only', 'charge', 'six', 'people', 'lives', 'also', 'separated', 'wife', 'who', 'custody', 'son', 'Affleck', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'character', 'mostly', 'emotionally', 'absent', 'entire', 'film', 'rightfully', 'so', 'six', 'Americans', 'stranded', 'Iran', 'portray', 'panic', 'anxiousness', 'very', 'well', 'John', 'Goodman', 'make-up', 'effects', 'artist', 'John', 'Chambers', 'fantastic', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'movie', 'director', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'Goodman', 'funny', 'charming', 'right', 'start', 'Arkin', 'BS', 'type', 'humor', 'years', 'movie', 'business', 'quick', 'wit', 'particularly', 'meeting', 'Affleck', 'have', 'regarding', 'rights', 'Argo', 'instantly', 'highlight', 'film.Ever', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'became', 'household', 'name', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'been', 'popping', 'up', 'lot', 'movies', 'Red', 'Tails', 'John', 'Carter', 'Madagascar', '3', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'Total', 'Recall', 'now', 'Argo', '2012', 'alone', 'usually', 'same', 'intensity', 'love', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'role', 'even', 'project', 'part', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Argo', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'effort', 'film-wise', 'so', 'far', 'just', 'so', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'other', 'options', 'when', 'character', 'end', 'rope', 'form', 'frustrated', 'panic', 'outstanding', 'thanks', 'magic', 'R-rated', 'films', 'chance', 'be', 'completely', 'unfiltered', 'here.What', 'disappointing', 'Argo', 'really', 'dull', 'Speaking', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'interest', 'was', 'solely', 'based', 'feedback', 'received', 'scenes', 'revolving', 'developing', 'fake', 'movie', 'include', 'John', 'Chambers', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'are', 'immediately', 'entertaining', 'obviously', 'secondary', 'lot', 'sitting', 'around', 'waiting', 'drinking', 'How', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'drinks', 'so', 'much', 'showing', 'signs', 'feeling', 'kind', 'astounding.Seeing', 'mechanics', 'happening', 'pretty', 'redundant', 'blue', 'mentality', 'film', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'happen', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'long', 'then', 'just', 'Oh', 'nevermind', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'people', 'talking', 'having', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'scrambling', 'figure', 'out', 'last', 'minute', 'solution', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'headed', 'really', 'difficult', 'having', 'knowledge', 'events', 'film', 'based', 'how', 'everything', 'out', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film', 'knowing', 'answer', 'riddle', 'beforehand', 'would', 'make', 'less', 'enjoyable.While', 'Argo', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'nominated', 'best', 'picture', 'Academy', 'Awards', ""n't"", 'mean', 'going', 'cater', 'everyone', 'anyone', 'who', 'going', 'fall', 'love', 'was', ""n't"", 'performances', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'pretty', 'boring', 'How', 'bad', 'fake', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'pulls', 'more', 'horrible', 'events', 'going', 'Iran.Some', 'moments', 'are', 'tense', 'many', 'are', 'portraying', 'overwhelming', 'sensation', 'never', 'up', 'two', 'hour', 'duration', 'just', ""n't"", 'case', 'not', ""'re"", 'interested', 'politics', 'history', 'surrounding', 'events', 'film', 'will', 'play', 'big', 'role', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Argo', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'viewed', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'target', 'audience', 'meantime', 'just', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'related', 'project', 'being', 'over', 'praised', 'who', 'attached', 'bureaucratic', 'subject', 'matter']",Argo
1500886,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B005S9ELM6,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 4]","Ben Affleck has been a leading man with credibility behind the camera as the Oscar-winning co-writer (with Matt Damon) of Good Will Hunting.  Having shown promise as a director in Gone Baby Gone and then excelling in The Town, he has peaked in his craft with Argo, a thoroughly engaging, real life thriller grounded in historic fact and abetted by a superior screenplay (Chris Terrio from a news article).On November 4, 1979 in revolutionary Iran, angry students storm the US embassy and take civilian and military hostages, but unknown to the public, six Americans escape to a nearby Canadian's home where they remain stranded with no hope of rescue.  Despite a myriad of standard tactics to spirit them out of Iran, every plan has a serious flaw, and each passing day heightens the probability of the Americans' discovery, capture, and possible execution as spies.  Enter Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), an expert at ex-filtration or the liberating of valuable government assets for the CIA.  His plan is a bold, imaginative conceit: a Hollywood movie crew scouting locations in Iran while sneaking the Americans out as part of the film crew.  Despite the misgivings of highly skeptical State Department and CIA officials led by Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), the mission is given a `go' with little hope of success.  Compounding things is the fact that the Iranians are painstakingly sifting through the embassy's hastily shredded documents.  With the assistance of an Oscar winning makeup artist, John Chambers (John Goodman), and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), Mendez creates an elaborate, fake science fiction movie named Argo complete with a script and cast.  Will this movie cover work and can Mendez get the six Americans to freedom in time?  As a true story only recently declassified by the US government, these actual events lead to a breathtaking finish.The authentic reenactment of the embassy takeover is expertly, vividly intercut seamlessly with real news footage.  Affleck has a keen eye for detail, and he convincingly captures the chaos and paranoia that grips the trapped Americans.  Good use of handheld camerawork adds to the authentic feel of this quasi-documentary narrative.  It's like an episode of TV's Mission Impossible, and, in fact, this could easily have been a made-for-TV movie, but it works better on the big screen where it has maximum impact.  There are more than passing similarities to Wag the Dog and its phony movie ruse.The Anti-American sentiment and mistrust fosters a claustrophobic atmosphere as the six Americans are under great pressure. The film depicts the real threats and atrocities in the city streets including random executions.  Not knowing who to trust, the Americans bicker amongst themselves with some expressing serious reservations about this unusual rescue premise while others are feeling despondent.  Their fear is not unlike those of pursued Holocaust civilians in World War II.Mendez, who risks his life to save these strangers, is also a father, and it is that relationship that frames his character in the film emotionally.  Chambers and Siegel (a composite character) are patriots with big egos, and while their comic relief is welcome (including a running gag: an off-color play on the word Argo,) in an otherwise suspense-filled narrative, one wonders what truly motivates them?The final airport sequence is unbearably tense as it ratchets up the threat, and such a relatively basic situation is executed to great effect.  We know how the story will end yet it affects us in a visceral way.  If the filmmakers take some dramatic license at the end, the film has earned the right to embellish the facts a bit further.

There were six people who stealthily escaped the takeover, hiding in the Canadian ambassador's house. The CIA is at a loss - they have only one idea concerning bicycles and it's not very bright.Enter Affleck's Tony Mendez: we first see him waking up with an empty beer can on his dresser, so he's got the makings of the typical maverick hero. While watching BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES on TV, Tony has an idea - become a producer of a bogus science fiction movie and, scouting a location in Iran, get the Americans out.A fantastic premise and an opportunity to blend classic cult films with a modern thriller... And with John Goodman (as a makeup artist) and Alan Arkin (as a wry producer) on board the Hollywood end, ARGO just can't miss... but it does. The six people that need saving have zero personality, making it hard to feel for their plight.Although we see clips of hangings and executions in Iran, there's hardly a vibe of impending danger or threat. While the clever aspects, mixing a fake press conference for the sci-fi flick with Iranians making real demands, are edited nicely, the movie-making scheme, which had so much potential, feels rushed. And Affleck himself lacks the edge of a central character, much less a heroic one.The best part is the last half hour as the seven (including Mendez), using fake passports as a Canadian production crew, move through an Iranian airport for the departing plane. Despite every ""last minute"" clich&eacute; thrown in the pot, as least there's some urgency.

They holed up in the Canadian ambassador's house, while the Canadian government and the CIA thought about how best to get them out.  Enter Tony Mendez, a CIA op who's specialty is extracting people.  Tony has a crazy idea, the ""best bad idea"" of the whole bunch: why not fake a Canadian film crew, scouting locations for a STAR WARS rip-off?Ben Affleck has so far limited his directing career to intimate projects: GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN, crime thrillers set in his hometown of Boston.  What made both films so brilliant was how personal they were to the writer/director.  Surprisingly, Affleck manages to bring this personal touch to ARGO: it's still an intimate film, centered around the people who made this grand scheme happen.  And what a cast of characters we have: Affleck's Mendez, a solid performance, if not quite enough to anchor the film.  (As evidenced by the film's second act, where the weight of the film is thrust onto Affleck's shoulders, and the movie flounders for a moment.)  The supporting cast far outshines the star: Alan Arkin as a film producer willing to back the whole thing; John Goodman as a makeup artist with CIA ties; and especially Bryan Cranston, chewing his way through his role as Mendez's superior.  There's also a whole host of cameos, in the great Hollywood tradition: Michael Parks, Bob Gunton, Richard Kind, Adrienne Barbeau, and others make blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearances.This comes off not as a novelty, but as an act of love.  Because ARGO isn't just a spy story; in a way, it's an affection note to Hollywood history.  Screenwriter Chris Terrio gives us a multi-layered script full of all things movie lovers enjoy: action; humor; heart; allusions; intrigue.  Basically all that's missing is the romance, but that's okay--this film is romantic enough, in the old tradition of great spy films, to suit anyone's needs.  ARGO may not be a masterpiece; perhaps it's not even Affleck's best directorial effort (that's a matter of taste).

Based on a true account, Ben Affleck (whodeserves all acting and directing kudos) maintains a tight leashthroughout, using tension and what-if dread as the main adrenalinebuilders. It is a testament to his ability that even knowing theoutcome does nothing to keep you from the edge of your seat. The CIAoperative he plays, Tony Mendez who masterminded the plot, is no JamesBond. He uses his brains, not his gun to achieve his goal, one thatseems insane to his superiors.The acting is precise and realistic. Comedy relief is provided byJohn Goodman as Hollywood special-effects guru John Chambers who has all the good lines.He and Alan Arkin, as producer Lester Siege,l maintain a rollicking R-ratedbanter together. This being a suspense thriller, there are some fabricatedscenes of last-minute miracles (phones picked up at the last second, etc)but they can be forgiven considering the excellence of the whole film.Sharp viewers will be treated to modern Iranian history at the introand it doesn't put the United States in a good light.

Like my father used to say when I was a kid: ""USE YOUR BRAINS!"" That's exactly what the main hero of Argo does! He uses his brains to solve a very complex problem in the real world!I can only imagine what would happen had Iran invaded our embassy in 2012 instead of 1979 and held 50 Americans hostage for 444 days! We would be at war and all the hostage would be dead by now. But Jimmy Carter practiced what he preached - and as a consequence - untold thousands of lives were saved by not going to war with Iran even though it cost him his re-election!For those who are ignorant about geography, Iran is larger than the state of Alaska! In other words, about as large as the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany COMBINED! Tehran,the capitol has population the same as New York City, which is about 8 million! The entire country is 75 million, which is about twice the population of California. According to the Composite Index of National Capability, Iran has the 15th most powerful military in the world! So all you warmongers salivating at going to war with Iran keep in mind we will be fighting the equivalent of two California's simultaneously - with one of the most powerful militaries on earth! I hope you're planing to send your sons, daughters and get a second mortgage on your house to fight a war of this magnitude!All I can say is to everyone involved with Argo from President Jimmy Carter to Ben Affleck is THANK YOU!

Say what you want about Affleck's &#34;Gigli&#34; days but the actor continues to prove he has what it takes to pull off a challenging role. Affleck's Mendez is meticulous and intelligent yet comfortable in not being recognized for the true hero that he was. The actor/director surrounds himself with great talent as well, such as the men who helped make his plan possible including Alan Arkin, John Goodman, and Bryan Cranston.The direction is this film is so good and once and for all proves that, though I enjoy his roles, Affleck is a much better director than actor. The story never waivers or lingers longer than it should and the introductory scene, as well as the white-knuckle finale are some of the most tense moments in recent movie history. The film also contains a lot of comedic moments, mainly as it pokes fun of the movie industry it's portraying. There's a real dark comedy feel to the film and Arkin and Goodman especially have some great lines.While I can't vouch for the validity of the historical accuracy behind the story, the film presented is engaging, political, and hard to forget. The movie is more than deserving of the plethora of awards it received and the hype it's obtained. Any pundits who claimed Affleck didn't have the chops to make it as a director in Hollywood can finally be silenced. With one of the best movies of the year and the Academy Award for Best Picture in his hand, Mr. Affleck will be able to make any movie he chooses from this point forward, and that is something to look forward to.",5,"Thrilling, Unbearably Tense & Surprisingly Funny, Ben Affleck Delivers The Best Film of the Year",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,1834,"['two', 'wildly', 'gripping', 'yet', 'commercially', 'underperforming', 'movies', 'belt', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'Town', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'finally', 'breakout', 'hit', '34', 'Argo', '34', 'smart', 'tense', 'thriller', 'terrific', 'cast', 'intensely', 'engaging', 'story.First', 'cast', 'here', 'amazing', 'Say', 'what', 'want', 'Affleck', '34', 'Gigli', '34', 'days', 'actor', 'prove', 'what', 'pull', 'off', 'challenging', 'role', 'Affleck', 'Mendez', 'meticulous', 'intelligent', 'yet', 'comfortable', 'not', 'being', 'recognized', 'true', 'hero', 'was', 'actor/director', 'great', 'talent', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'men', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'plan', 'possible', 'including', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Bryan', 'Cranston.The', 'direction', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'once', 'proves', 'enjoy', 'roles', 'Affleck', 'much', 'better', 'director', 'actor', 'story', 'never', 'waivers', 'lingers', 'longer', 'should', 'introductory', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'white-knuckle', 'finale', 'are', 'most', 'tense', 'moments', 'recent', 'movie', 'history', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'comedic', 'moments', 'mainly', 'fun', 'movie', 'industry', 'portraying', 'real', 'dark', 'comedy', 'feel', 'film', 'Arkin', 'Goodman', 'especially', 'have', 'great', 'lines.While', 'ca', ""n't"", 'vouch', 'validity', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'story', 'film', 'presented', 'engaging', 'political', 'hard', 'forget', 'movie', 'more', 'deserving', 'plethora', 'awards', 'received', 'hype', 'obtained', 'pundits', 'who', 'claimed', 'Affleck', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chops', 'make', 'director', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'finally', 'be', 'silenced', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'hand', 'Mr.', 'Affleck', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'movie', 'point', 'forward', 'something', 'look', 'forward']",Argo

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[19, 28]","""Argo,"" among the nominees for the 2012 Best Picture Academy Awards, may very well be the best film of 2012, and Ben Affleck may very well be the best director. Unlike other frontrunners, ""Lincoln"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""Argo"" is a movie-movie. Like those other two films, it tells a true story, but unlike those other two, disappointing films, ""Argo"" is not a starchy and lumpy docudrama. ""Argo"" is a smoothly running machine.""Argo"" tells a gripping story in a gripping way, never preaching (""Lincoln""), never getting too caught up in one aspect of the story to distort the narrative line (""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lincoln."") ""Argo"" wants to entertain you, and it does. It's a thriller. My palms were sweating as much while watching this movie as while watching an old-fashioned suspense flick by Alfred Hitchcock, even though, like most viewers, I know how the story ends. I found the opening scene of the storming of the US embassy in Tehran so frightening I could hardly watch it. This is all the  more remarkable given that I'd heard a radio interview in which Affleck joked about finding only older actors to perform the part of the ""students"" storming the embassy.""Argo""'s cast is full of actors I know well, have seen in many other films, and whom I like a lot: Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Victor Garber, Bryan Cranston. It's testimony to the film's power that I stopped thinking about these actors and got lost in the characters they were playing.""Argo"" tells the true story of a CIA plot to release six Americans from Iran during the hostage crisis. The plot: pretend that the six Americans are Canadians there to scout locations for an upcoming Sci-Fi flick.John Goodman and Alan Arkin are utterly believable, funny, and moving as the Hollywood part of the team. There's a brilliant, throwaway scene in which Alan Arkin and Richard Kind bargain over the price of a movie script. The scene doesn't advance the plot, but the dialogue is perfect and fast. It's just a witty respite in a tense movie about a life-and-death situation. Ben Affleck is perfect as a CIA operative. He keeps his cards very close to his chest.Farshad Farahat plays an amazingly hairy airport guard. He screams in Farsi. Most audience members, not speaking Farsi, will have no idea what this man is saying - there are no subtitles. Even so, we are terrified. Farahat deserves an award for his brief but pivotal performance as the face and voice of the enemy the entire world now confronts, an enemy driven by incoherent, focused, murderous rage.""Argo"" has a little bit of heartwarming family drama, a little bit of arcane CIA in-shop detail, a little bit of Hollywood behind-the-scenes banter, a very little bit of nightmarish torture. It never lingers in one type of scene too long; it just glides along, telling its story as economically and movingly as possible.",5,May Very Well Be the Best Film of 2012,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,2856,"['Argo', 'nominees', '2012', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'film', '2012', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'director', 'other', 'frontrunners', 'Lincoln', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'Argo', 'movie-movie', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'true', 'story', 'other', 'two', 'disappointing', 'films', 'Argo', 'not', 'starchy', 'lumpy', 'docudrama', 'Argo', 'smoothly', 'running', 'machine', 'Argo', 'gripping', 'story', 'gripping', 'way', 'never', 'preaching', 'Lincoln', 'never', 'getting', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'one', 'aspect', 'story', 'distort', 'narrative', 'line', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'Lincoln', 'Argo', 'entertain', 'thriller', 'palms', 'were', 'sweating', 'as', 'much', 'watching', 'movie', 'watching', 'old-fashioned', 'suspense', 'flick', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'even', 'most', 'viewers', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'found', 'opening', 'scene', 'storming', 'US', 'embassy', 'Tehran', 'frightening', 'could', 'hardly', 'watch', 'more', 'remarkable', 'given', ""'d"", 'heard', 'radio', 'interview', 'Affleck', 'joked', 'finding', 'only', 'older', 'actors', 'perform', 'part', 'students', 'storming', 'embassy', 'Argo', 'cast', 'full', 'actors', 'know', 'well', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'whom', 'like', 'lot', 'Affleck', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'testimony', 'film', 'power', 'stopped', 'thinking', 'actors', 'got', 'lost', 'characters', 'were', 'playing', 'Argo', 'true', 'story', 'CIA', 'plot', 'release', 'six', 'Americans', 'Iran', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'plot', 'pretend', 'six', 'Americans', 'are', 'Canadians', 'there', 'scout', 'locations', 'upcoming', 'Sci-Fi', 'flick.John', 'Goodman', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'are', 'utterly', 'believable', 'funny', 'moving', 'Hollywood', 'part', 'team', 'brilliant', 'throwaway', 'scene', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'bargain', 'price', 'movie', 'script', 'scene', ""n't"", 'advance', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'perfect', 'fast', 'just', 'witty', 'respite', 'tense', 'movie', 'life-and-death', 'situation', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'perfect', 'CIA', 'operative', 'cards', 'very', 'close', 'chest.Farshad', 'Farahat', 'amazingly', 'hairy', 'airport', 'guard', 'Farsi', 'Most', 'audience', 'members', 'not', 'speaking', 'Farsi', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'man', 'saying', 'are', 'subtitles', 'Even', 'so', 'are', 'terrified', 'Farahat', 'award', 'brief', 'pivotal', 'performance', 'face', 'voice', 'enemy', 'entire', 'world', 'now', 'enemy', 'driven', 'incoherent', 'focused', 'murderous', 'rage', 'Argo', 'little', 'bit', 'heartwarming', 'family', 'drama', 'little', 'bit', 'arcane', 'CIA', 'in-shop', 'detail', 'little', 'bit', 'Hollywood', 'behind-the-scenes', 'banter', 'very', 'little', 'bit', 'nightmarish', 'torture', 'never', 'one', 'type', 'scene', 'too', 'long', 'just', 'along', 'telling', 'story', 'economically', 'movingly', 'possible']",Argo

Even ""Lincoln"" would have been more deserving.So I downloaded this movie via eMule.  That's right, I wasn't going to give up any real money to watch this fraud of a movie, I just wanted to see what the hoopla was all about.  And I do believe in supporting movies that I really like, often buying all the DVD/Blu-ray, high definition etc., versions of the movies that I truly love.  ""Les Mis"" is going to get my money.The biggest strike against ""Argo"" is that it is a completely false re-write of the real history of what happened.  Yes, Hollywood does that, and it is called artistic license, but the clear cut self-congratulatory effort to hugely inflate the role of Hollywood in the story, while downplaying the role of the Canadians and inserting false slams against some of our allies made this movie unworthy to even be considered as a Best Picture candidate.Entertainment value?  Meh.  Just another caper movie.  Not one of my favorite kinds of movies.  Again, unworthy of a Best Picture nomination.OK, so maybe this movie doesn't deserve a one star rating just on its merits as a mildly interesting caper movie with a terrible distortion of history, but it deserves its one star for having campaigned to get an Oscar for Best Picture.It is simply beyond my understanding why Hollywood keeps doing this - all it does is totally discredit the Oscar award as a legitimate award with any meaning.A previous example of the Oscar going to an undeserving picture was when ""Shakespeare in Love"" won Best Picture over  ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture in 1999.Now, I did sort of like ""Shakespeare in Love"", but seriously, ""Saving Private Ryan""  will go down in history as a landmark war movie, one of the best of all time, whereas nobody will remember the lightweight fluff of ""Shakespeare in Love"".A worse fate awaits ""Argo"", an utterly forgettable caper movie filled with badly re-written history, winning the Oscar for Best Picture only because of the internal politicking of the Academy and its propensity for self-congratulation.",1,Best Picture of 2012?

The film is a highly fictionalized version of a real-life hostage rescue operation that allows Affleck to direct himself playing a hero. Its like a really good television drama like Raid on Entebbe (1976) but with slighly higher production values and an excellent soundtrack (Stones, Van Halen, Led Zep). I think it wants to be Dog Day Afternoon or All the Presidents Men but neither the characters nor any of their individual stories are particularly interesting, the gimmicky operation (a cheesy space epic with an Orientalist twist) is the star of the film. Affleck doesn't act so much as play straight man to zany John Goodman and zanier Alan Arkin (who really provide much of the entertainment value). The film succeeds at capturing the time period (by seamlessly joining historical and pseudo-historical footage of the actual revolution and storming of the embassy), and it succeeds in manufacturing just the right amount of suspense to keep viewers on the edge of their seats without wearing them out with too much political complication. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Lincoln. Its a perfectly competent film about a very outlandish CIA operation but it doesn't try to make any kind of comment on terrorism. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Zero Dark Thirty. Its the perfect film for people tired of politics and of thinking (if the film wins Best Pic on Sunday, its probably because thats the mood of the country right now). But if you want an even better film about terrorism in the Seventies, I'd recommend the award-winning HBO miniseries Carlos (Olivier Assayas, 2010).",3,"Solid Made for TV-ish 70's Style Suspense-Thriller, Not A Film Classic",1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1760,"['Oscar', 'nominees', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'also', 'least', 'ambitious', 'account', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'suspense-thriller', 'film', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'real-life', 'hostage', 'rescue', 'operation', 'Affleck', 'direct', 'playing', 'hero', 'really', 'good', 'television', 'drama', 'Raid', 'Entebbe', '1976', 'slighly', 'higher', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'Stones', 'Van', 'Halen', 'Led', 'Zep', 'think', 'be', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Presidents', 'Men', 'characters', 'individual', 'stories', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'gimmicky', 'operation', 'cheesy', 'space', 'epic', 'Orientalist', 'twist', 'star', 'film', 'Affleck', ""n't"", 'act', 'so', 'much', 'play', 'straight', 'man', 'zany', 'John', 'Goodman', 'zanier', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'really', 'provide', 'much', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'capturing', 'time', 'period', 'seamlessly', 'joining', 'historical', 'pseudo-historical', 'footage', 'actual', 'revolution', 'storming', 'embassy', 'manufacturing', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'suspense', 'keep', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seats', 'wearing', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'political', 'complication', 'Hence', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'Lincoln', 'perfectly', 'competent', 'film', 'very', 'outlandish', 'CIA', 'operation', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'kind', 'comment', 'terrorism', 'Hence', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'perfect', 'film', 'people', 'tired', 'politics', 'thinking', 'film', 'Best', 'Pic', 'Sunday', 'probably', 'thats', 'mood', 'country', 'right', 'now', 'want', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'terrorism', 'Seventies', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'award-winning', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'Carlos', 'Olivier', 'Assayas', '2010']",Argo

I agree, and consider that one of the film's strongest points. It's easy to understand why many who are used to today's expertly hypertech film production are disappointed or at least dismayed by ARGO's atmosphere. Its subject is neither ""current"" nor what most of us consider ""history."" Ergo, the straightforward and unsensationalized cinematography helps to capture the mood of these events and also contributes to the time setting, i.e., really harks back to 1980.Excellent script: Especially insofar as the CIA and State Department are concerned, it made me think, ""That's how the talks must have gone."" The news bits and reenactments of the demonstrations in Tehran are equally mesmerizing. There were times when I wished for subtitles of all the chanting and other Iranian dialogue, but at the same time, I like the way ARGO allows room for anyone not fluent in Farsi to sense the gist of it all.Though his acting performance is plastic indeed, Affleck's direction of this film is truly fine, and the acting by most of the other major players, particularly those who play the would-be hostages and those who play the various Iranians, is good and often great.",4,"A Straightforward, Riveting, and Basically True Story",1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,1785,"['Anti-Spoiler', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'six', 'American', 'citizens', 'who', 'escaped', 'U.S.', 'Embassy', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'Tehran', '1980', 'might', 'work', 'better', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'more', 'beforehand', 'order', 'save', 'element', 'surprise', 'way', 'however', 'ARGO', 'quite', 'gripping', 'information', 'declassified', '1997', 'should', 'be', 'significantly', 'interesting', 'Even', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'basic', 'story', 'out', 'should', 'find', 'human', 'interest', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'details', 'how', 'apparently', 'occurred.Many', 'have', 'complained', 'ARGO', 'made-for-television', 'feel', 'agree', 'consider', 'one', 'film', 'strongest', 'points', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'today', 'expertly', 'hypertech', 'film', 'production', 'are', 'disappointed', 'least', 'dismayed', 'ARGO', 'atmosphere', 'subject', 'current', 'what', 'most', 'consider', 'history', 'Ergo', 'straightforward', 'unsensationalized', 'cinematography', 'capture', 'mood', 'events', 'also', 'time', 'setting', 'i.e.', 'really', 'back', '1980.Excellent', 'script', 'Especially', 'insofar', 'CIA', 'State', 'Department', 'are', 'concerned', 'made', 'think', 'how', 'talks', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'news', 'bits', 'reenactments', 'demonstrations', 'Tehran', 'are', 'equally', 'mesmerizing', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'wished', 'subtitles', 'chanting', 'other', 'Iranian', 'dialogue', 'same', 'time', 'like', 'way', 'ARGO', 'room', 'anyone', 'not', 'fluent', 'Farsi', 'sense', 'gist', 'acting', 'performance', 'plastic', 'indeed', 'Affleck', 'direction', 'film', 'truly', 'fine', 'acting', 'most', 'other', 'major', 'players', 'particularly', 'who', 'play', 'would-be', 'hostages', 'who', 'play', 'various', 'Iranians', 'good', 'often', 'great']",Argo

The action sequences are extremely well handled, with a nicely judged opening to the film, building up to a tense climax as the hostages are successfully extricated, despite the attentions of the Iranian military. However the film's effect is reduced somewhat by sentimental plot-lines (the sequences involving Affleck's family are spurious, to say the least), plus an orientalist perspective that continues to portray all members of Muslim nations as fanatics or religious obsessives.

The abundance of distinct, colorful characters and speedy editing, though, are what I found most appreciable. At times it almost feels like one long montage, with a short attention span and lots of quick cuts, but a nose for pertinent info and several key performances from its cast add enough substance to flesh things out nicely. Although Affleck's grim, game-faced leading character is often subdued to a fault, his Hollywood contacts (Alan Arkin and John Goodman), Washington supervisor (Bryan Cranston) and scared-stiff American refugees make up for those inadequacies with vigor.

And it really loves movies where Hollywood helps the CIA save the day.In fact, you can practically hear the producers squealing whenever cynical Hollywoodites appear in ""Argo,"" helping set up a sensitive operation to rescue innocent Americans from peril. The movie itself is a fairly decent dramatization of a real-life rescue from Iran, but ironically the halfhearted Hollywood qualities are also what bogs down the story.When the United States gives asylum to the dying Shah of Iran, a militant mob retaliates by attacking the American Embassy in Tehran. Six people escape to the Canadian ambassador's house, but they have no way of getting home -- if they even try to step outside, they will be recognized and killed.So the State Department calls on Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA specialist who immediately shoots down all their idiotic ideas. He has the kind of idiotic idea that you seriously think Hollywood made up: pretend to be a team of Canadian filmmakers scouting for locations for a sci-fi/fantasy movie. Yes, seriously. With no better ideas on the table, the government reluctantly gives approval.With the help of film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman), Mendez sets up a fake studio, fake casting, and a terrible script called ""Argo."" Posing as a producer, Mendez infiltrates Iran with a bunch of fake Canadian passports -- but one slip could mean death for him and the hostages.I admit to knowing very little about the real-life hostage situation, because it happened long before I was born. But even before being dramatized by Hollywood, it's a pretty bizarre story -- and I doubt Hollywood could have found a more ideal movie to lavish praise on. After all, it's about Hollywood helping save the day from Evil Middle-Easterners!And the movie is genuinely well-done, especially once we get to Tehran -- there is a palpable sense of tension, as if Mendez and the hostages are dancing over tripwires. You really feel the delicate situations that are arising, and how the slightest mistake could get everyone killed. And despite the truly ridiculous ""making a movie"" idea (complete with costumes!), director/actor Ben Affleck does manage to handle it with a straight face.However, it also suffers from some excessively cheesy dialogue (""No, I was screaming his name 'cause I was f***ing him""), and some hideously awkward attempts at character development. The whole ""absentee daddy"" subplot is just so painfully Hollywood, as is the scene where the plane tickets are approved JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME, or when the Iranian guards chase them all the way to the plane.And while it attempts to show that the greatest victims of tyranny in Iran are its people, almost all the Iranians we see are either beady-eyed, bearded thugs or ravening rage-zombie mobs. It's just one of many hoary old cliches that are trotted out here.Ben Affleck was starring as well as directing here, and he does an excellent job job -- he's subtle and low-key, especially during the scenes where they try to sneak through an airport. Most of the other notable performances are from the Hollywood ""characters,"" namely Arkin and Goodman; the government suits are honestly hard to tell apart, and rarely do much except bluster.""Argo"" is a solid thriller with a quietly compelling, intense style, and Affleck does a good job juggling direction and acting.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[1, 1]","""Argo,"" directed by and starring Ben Affleck, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio (based on Joshuah Bearman's article in ""Wired"" magazine), is a feel-good movie based on a true story. On November 4, 1979, a horde of angry students and militants scaled the walls of the American Embassy in Teheran. Six Americans escaped and found safe haven with Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. Affleck plays thirty-eight year old Tony Mendez, a brash CIA operative who specializes in exfiltration--spiriting people out of hostile countries to safety. He teams up with two unlikely allies, makeup artist John Chambers (the always watchable John Goodman) and a Hollywood producer, Lester Siegel (played with his usual zest by Alan Arkin) to bring the six stranded Americans home.The plan is for Mendez to enter Iran in January 1980 under false pretenses. He pretends to be a film director scouting locations in the Middle East for his new science fiction flick, ""Argo."" Chambers and Siegel had previously launched a publicity campaign, complete with ads in Variety to make their project appear more credible. Days after his arrival, Mendez provides the six Americans, who will pose as members of a Canadian film crew, with false passports. Mendez had quite a few hurdles to overcome. Among theme: to garner the support of the U. S. government for his harebrained scheme; to persuade the frightened and beleaguered six men and women to trust him; and to hoodwink the paranoid Iranians.This engaging movie has welcome bits of humor to lighten the mood, and the actors, including Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber, and Tate Donovan, all turn in fine performances. The theme could not be timelier, since the United States is still an embattled nation trying to protect her diplomats abroad. Unfortunately, Affleck's direction is at times a bit heavy-handed, particularly in the last fifteen minutes. He and the screenwriter create a clich&eacute;d race against time along with frustrating snags that never existed; this portion of the film feels forced and contrived. Another problem is the intrusive musical score that bludgeons us instead of blending in subtly with the story. Still, ""Argo"" is worth seeing, since on the whole it is an engrossing and entertaining motion picture for thinking adults who care about history and politics.",4,"""We are responsible for these people.""",1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,2309,"['Argo', 'directed', 'starring', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'screenplay', 'Chris', 'Terrio', 'based', 'Joshuah', 'Bearman', 'article', 'Wired', 'magazine', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'November', '4', '1979', 'horde', 'angry', 'students', 'militants', 'scaled', 'walls', 'American', 'Embassy', 'Teheran', 'Six', 'Americans', 'escaped', 'found', 'safe', 'haven', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'Ken', 'Taylor', 'Affleck', 'thirty-eight', 'year', 'old', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'brash', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'exfiltration', 'spiriting', 'people', 'hostile', 'countries', 'safety', 'up', 'two', 'unlikely', 'allies', 'makeup', 'artist', 'John', 'Chambers', 'always', 'watchable', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'played', 'usual', 'zest', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'bring', 'six', 'stranded', 'Americans', 'home.The', 'plan', 'Mendez', 'enter', 'Iran', 'January', '1980', 'false', 'pretenses', 'be', 'film', 'director', 'scouting', 'locations', 'Middle', 'East', 'new', 'science', 'fiction', 'flick', 'Argo', 'Chambers', 'Siegel', 'had', 'previously', 'launched', 'publicity', 'campaign', 'complete', 'ads', 'Variety', 'make', 'project', 'more', 'credible', 'Days', 'arrival', 'Mendez', 'six', 'Americans', 'who', 'will', 'pose', 'members', 'Canadian', 'film', 'crew', 'false', 'passports', 'Mendez', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'hurdles', 'overcome', 'theme', 'garner', 'support', 'U.', 'S.', 'government', 'harebrained', 'scheme', 'persuade', 'frightened', 'beleaguered', 'six', 'men', 'women', 'trust', 'hoodwink', 'paranoid', 'Iranians.This', 'engaging', 'movie', 'welcome', 'bits', 'humor', 'lighten', 'mood', 'actors', 'including', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'theme', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'timelier', 'United', 'States', 'still', 'embattled', 'nation', 'trying', 'protect', 'diplomats', 'abroad', 'Unfortunately', 'Affleck', 'direction', 'times', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'particularly', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'screenwriter', 'create', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'race', 'time', 'frustrating', 'snags', 'never', 'existed', 'portion', 'film', 'feels', 'forced', 'contrived', 'problem', 'intrusive', 'musical', 'score', 'bludgeons', 'instead', 'blending', 'subtly', 'story', 'Still', 'Argo', 'worth', 'seeing', 'whole', 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'motion', 'picture', 'thinking', 'adults', 'who', 'care', 'history', 'politics']",Argo

1500981,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B005S9ELM6,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 6]","Ben Affleck the actor has never impressed me much, a journeyman who has made some real stinkers (Gigli,Surviving Christmas), but Ben Affleck the filmmaker has really come into his own. His third film as a director (Gone Baby Gone,The Town) is a first-rate political thriller with a pulpish fervor and keen intelligence. The Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81 takes on revitalized life in this engrossing 2012 movie with great period detail and a well-turned screenplay by first-timer Chris Terrio. The recent Benghazi killings only makes this story resonate more with an event hidden from history prior to 1997 propulsively dramatized here as a turning point in the precarious state of U.S. relations with the entire Arab world. It's fascinating to consider the truth behind the ""best bad idea"" the CIA could concoct to rescue six U.S. embassy workers who managed to escape the compound. There's a blessedly brief prologue chronicling the events that led to the Shah's exile to the U.S. and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini and fundamentalist Islam in Iran leading to the tense hostage situation.The six workers found refuge at the Canadian embassy. With the CIA at a loss to figure out how to sneak them out of Iran, exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez is inspired a bit ofBattle For The Planet Of The Apesto come up with an incredulous plot to have the six pose as a Canadian film crew who were flown to Teheran to scout locations for a phony sci-fi film that gives this movie its name. Mendez enlists prosthetics expert, real-life makeup artist John Chambers, to help convince veteran producer Lester Siegel to get studio backing for the fake epic. Siegel insists the picture look credible, so he buys an existing script, holds a reading with real actors at the Beverly Hilton, and starts an advertising campaign in the trade papers. All the gears are set in motion as Mendez's boss Jack O'Donnell miraculously gains approval for the far-fetched plan. Mendez flies to Teheran with doctored passports in hand and tries to convince the six to act out their roles with precise detail before they get recognized by Iranian officials as escapees from the embassy.This race against the clock provides the tension in the film's final act, which comes down to a rather implausible albeit extremely thrilling chase scene at the airport. With Affleck in mostly stoic mode as Mendez, the cast is solidly effective with three unsurprising standouts - John Goodman as the avuncular Chambers, Bryan Cranston as the acerbic O'Donnell, and Alan Arkin who steals all his scenes with ease as Siegel. All the period detail is excellent from the tacky clothes to the Turkish locations standing in for Iran. The slightly washed-out documentary-style of Rodrigo Prieto's (Brokeback Mountain) cinematography perfectly captures the crowded, often squalid atmosphere. There's also an evocative use of vintage TV news clips featuring Mike Wallace's infamous interview with Khomeini. The final explanation of how the real story of the mission unfolded is provided in a voice-over by Jimmy Carter, who was President when it all took place up until the rest of the hostages were released. The film is a genre picture at heart but a historically evocative and emotionally powerful one thanks to Affleck's impressive work behind the camera.",5,Affleck the Filmmaker Soars on His Third Effort with an Evocative Historic Thriller,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,3310,"['Ben', 'Affleck', 'actor', 'never', 'impressed', 'much', 'journeyman', 'who', 'made', 'real', 'stinkers', 'Gigli', 'Surviving', 'Christmas', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'filmmaker', 'really', 'come', 'own', 'third', 'film', 'director', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'Town', 'first-rate', 'political', 'thriller', 'pulpish', 'fervor', 'keen', 'intelligence', 'Iran', 'hostage', 'crisis', '1979-81', 'revitalized', 'life', 'engrossing', '2012', 'movie', 'great', 'period', 'detail', 'well-turned', 'screenplay', 'first-timer', 'Chris', 'Terrio', 'recent', 'Benghazi', 'only', 'story', 'resonate', 'more', 'event', 'hidden', 'history', 'prior', '1997', 'propulsively', 'dramatized', 'here', 'turning', 'point', 'precarious', 'state', 'U.S.', 'relations', 'entire', 'Arab', 'world', 'fascinating', 'consider', 'truth', 'best', 'bad', 'idea', 'CIA', 'could', 'concoct', 'rescue', 'six', 'U.S.', 'embassy', 'workers', 'who', 'managed', 'escape', 'compound', 'blessedly', 'brief', 'prologue', 'chronicling', 'events', 'led', 'Shah', 'exile', 'U.S.', 'rise', 'Ayatollah', 'Khomeini', 'fundamentalist', 'Islam', 'Iran', 'leading', 'tense', 'hostage', 'situation.The', 'six', 'workers', 'found', 'refuge', 'Canadian', 'embassy', 'CIA', 'loss', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'sneak', 'Iran', 'exfiltration', 'specialist', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'inspired', 'bit', 'ofBattle', 'Planet', 'Apesto', 'come', 'up', 'incredulous', 'plot', 'have', 'six', 'pose', 'Canadian', 'film', 'crew', 'who', 'were', 'flown', 'Teheran', 'scout', 'locations', 'phony', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'movie', 'name', 'Mendez', 'prosthetics', 'expert', 'real-life', 'makeup', 'artist', 'John', 'Chambers', 'help', 'convince', 'veteran', 'producer', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'get', 'studio', 'backing', 'fake', 'epic', 'Siegel', 'picture', 'look', 'credible', 'existing', 'script', 'reading', 'real', 'actors', 'Beverly', 'Hilton', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'trade', 'papers', 'gears', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'Mendez', 'boss', 'Jack', ""O'Donnell"", 'miraculously', 'gains', 'approval', 'far-fetched', 'plan', 'Mendez', 'Teheran', 'doctored', 'passports', 'hand', 'tries', 'convince', 'six', 'act', 'out', 'roles', 'precise', 'detail', 'get', 'recognized', 'Iranian', 'officials', 'escapees', 'embassy.This', 'race', 'clock', 'tension', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'down', 'rather', 'implausible', 'albeit', 'extremely', 'thrilling', 'chase', 'scene', 'airport', 'Affleck', 'mostly', 'stoic', 'mode', 'Mendez', 'cast', 'solidly', 'effective', 'three', 'unsurprising', 'standouts', 'John', 'Goodman', 'avuncular', 'Chambers', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'acerbic', ""O'Donnell"", 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'scenes', 'ease', 'Siegel', 'period', 'detail', 'excellent', 'tacky', 'clothes', 'Turkish', 'locations', 'standing', 'Iran', 'slightly', 'washed-out', 'documentary-style', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'cinematography', 'perfectly', 'crowded', 'often', 'squalid', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'evocative', 'use', 'vintage', 'TV', 'news', 'clips', 'featuring', 'Mike', 'Wallace', 'infamous', 'interview', 'Khomeini', 'final', 'explanation', 'how', 'real', 'story', 'mission', 'unfolded', 'provided', 'voice-over', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'who', 'was', 'President', 'when', 'took', 'place', 'up', 'rest', 'hostages', 'were', 'released', 'film', 'genre', 'picture', 'heart', 'historically', 'evocative', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'one', 'thanks', 'Affleck', 'impressive', 'work', 'camera']",Argo

One was the acting of Ben Affleck after I had seen him in ""Changing Lanes"" and two, ""based on true events,"" which essentially means they used a real story to make their own story.The ""story"" starts out with the American Embassy being overrun by a mob in 1979. Six diplomats escape and hide in the Canadian Embassy while talking heads in the State Department at Foggy Bottom try to figure a way to extract them. Enter Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent, who hatches a scheme to go into Iran under the guise of a Canadian crew looking for locations to shoot a sci-fi film. It has to be realistic so he seeks out a costume and make-up designer played by John Goodman with whom Mendez had a real life friendship. They manage to enlist the aid of a Hollywood producer played by Allan Arkin. They also need press, so they throw a party for their movie, Argo. It gets written up in Variety.Armed with magazine articles, cartoons, phony biographies, business cards and a fake Canadian passport, he spirits his way into Iran and to the Canadian ambassador's residence. We see photos of citizens not true to the revolution being hung from crane equipment and in other modes of terminated wellness conditions. This is to build the suspense along with the one diplomat who doesn't like the idea and he gives the audience the impression of the one who will blow it if anyone does.Using a VW microbus they scout the streets of Tehran in their roles. They drive their way slowly through a march in the streets and past the screams of citizens who all seem to have had aspirins with ""Cafe Loco"" chasers of the strongest bean. When they get to the airport, all airport staff from customs inspectors to local revolutionary enforcers licensed to kill, seem to be in suspicion lock-down mode, as if they can sniff out any American behind a Canadian passport. The drama heightens here, and the whole airport scene is what is created ""based on true events."" I suspect it is the same when the American government decided to nix the operation which will practically guarantee the capture of her citizens and blow the operation in progress.One reviewer describes the adverse Canadian reaction to this picture, which places them in a minor role when they had a much more pivotal one.  He describes the Canadian ambassador appearing as nothing more than an innkeeper. Actually it appeared as a very nice Bed n' Breakfast-Lunch-and-Dinner, eh?The good news was that Affleck's acting seems to have matured. He creates a taut and gripping film thanks to his direction, cast and license that ""it's based on true events."" John Goodman's performance is subtle where Allan Arkin is better at being prickly--""Argo (blank) yourself!"" he says. It became the challenge and password of the film.

Little remembered is that in the same year the Iranians took over our embassy in Tehran, a total of NINE such facilities were overrun by ""students"" and occupied, in most cases for only about a week, whereas this case was 444 days of imprisonment for the hostages, but the bad guys STIll hold our Embassy.

The movie fails to give appropriate credit to the Canadians for their involvement, and seems to emphasize the part of the American appointees under Carter.

But this film gives that whole incident immediacy and depth. I walked away with a much greater appreciation for what went down.Here's the scoop. The American embassy in Tehran is stormed. Hostages are taken. Six manage to escape and hole up in the home of the Canadian ambassador. An intelligence operative, Ben Affleck, concocts a plan to mock up a team to scout locations for a fictitious science fiction movie to be shot there. The team will consist of the six escapees and the cover will help get them out of the country. A tough road to be sure.It is difficult to convey how good this movie is. It hits the ground running with the siege on the embassy. You get a real sense of the fervor building up on the outside and the panic that ensues on the inside. Bodies running back and forth. The shredding of documents and destroying of electronic files. It's out and out mayhem. Then there's the concocting and honing of the plan itself. The people are brought in. The approvals are made and the pieces are all brought together. The doubts build as they are laid out with just about everyone including some of those they are trying to save. But at a given point they cross the Rubicon and it's full steam ahead. Things now get really tense because either it will work or it won't and everyone dies. What's cool about it is, like ""Apollo 13,"" the viewer knows how it will turn out but it doesn't lessen the fear and tension. I was on the edge of my seat. Now my guess is the script was tweeked for the added tension. I doubt the original incident came down to the razor's edge shown in the film, but it made for great cinema.Great attention was paid to the period. The clothing and hair styles were spot on. The movie was interlaced with actual news footage from the main hostage incident to give it a real sense of authenticity. All the actors handled their roles well. It's always a hoot to see John Goodman and he doesn't disappoint here. Alan Arkin is his usual good self, but everyone, even the secondary characters did a sweet job. They also went to great lengths to make most of the main characters involved look like the originals. Ben Affleck is now 3 for 3 on his feature film directing. He shows a deft hand here. I'm guessing this would hold up well under repeat viewings.

If I catch them on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I'll end up liking most of the ones I watch. &#34;Argo&#34; is one of those movies I would have passed up watching had it not been for one catch. The idea of the government using the making of a fake space / fantasy film to free hostages from Iran intrigued me. Once again, I'm very glad I listened to my instincts and took it in.In 1979, six Americans are put in hiding by the Canadian Embassy when the U.S. Embassy is raided in Iran by militants. Everyone else in the building is taken hostage. The U.S. government decides to take the unconventional advice of CIA operative Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to get the six diplomats out of the country. He will enter Iran and smuggle them out as a group of filmmakers scouting for shooting locations for a fake science fiction / fantasy film entitled &#34;Argo.&#34;Ben Affleck continues to surprise me. He's always done his own thing in Hollywood. He'll do smaller films playing less conventional characters like &#34;Dazed and Confused,&#34; &#34;Mallrats,&#34; and &#34;Chasing Amy.&#34; The next thing you know he's taking the lead in blockbusters and popcorn flicks such as &#34;Armageddon,&#34; &#34;Daredevil,&#34; &#34;Pearl Harbor,&#34; and &#34;The Sum of All Fears.&#34; Affleck's had his share of stinkers and received some unwanted attention in the tabloids as well. What actor hasn't?One thing Affleck has done is prove he's a versatile talent in Tinseltown and isn't going away any time soon. He won an Oscar for his &#34;Good Will Hunting&#34; script and continues to collect awards for &#34;Argo.&#34; The movie is nominated for an Oscar for &#34;Best Picture&#34; and it deserves the honor.&#34;Argo&#34; appealed to me in so many ways. I was born in 1972 and was completely caught up in &#34;Star Wars,&#34; &#34;Star Trek,&#34; and &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; fevers. A movie based in that time period about people making a fake sci-fi movie as a front to save hostages is captivating.Add to that the fact that award-winning &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; makeup artist John Chambers helped the government get the hostages out of Iran. I remember seeing the news broadcasts about the hostage situation as a boy, but I didn't understand what was going on at the time. The whole event is interesting to learn about.The audio and video transfer for the Blu-ray version of &#34;Argo&#34; will please consumers. The picture is clean with well-balanced color. The 5.1 surround sound mix immerses the viewer in the atmosphere of each scene.There are quite a few interesting bonus features included. Audio commentary for the feature is provided by director Ben Affleck and writer Chris Terrio. &#34;Picture in Picture: Eyewitness Account&#34; contains interviews with the survivors of the Iran hostage crisis, President Jimmy Carter, Tony Mendez, Mark Lijek, Bob Anders, Cora Lijek, Kathy Stafford, Lee Schatz, USMC hostage Al Golacinski, and others involved in the events. Four featurettes entitled &#34;Rescued from Tehran: We Were There,&#34; &#34;Absolute Authenticity,&#34; &#34;The CIA and Hollywood Connection,&#34; and &#34;Escape from Iran: The Hollywood Option&#34; are included as well.&#34;Argo&#34; is an exciting political thriller which will have you white-knuckled and gripping the edge of your seat. Director Ben Affleck did a great job keeping up the suspense and pacing in the film. Even though you know how it's going to end, you are still nervous for the characters as you watch.

1501029,A2BPDFR58H9575,B005S9ELM6,Galina,"[1, 2]","Based on the actual historical events from 33 years ago, new Ben Affleck's film ""Argo"" which he produced, directed and starred in, is an excellent picture and a gorgeous thriller. The film recreates the episode associated with the rescue of six American diplomats, who managed to escape from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the assault and seizure of the embassy by Iranian militant students-rebels on Nov. 4, 1979, and who found refuge in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador at the time, Ken Taylor. CIA in conjunction with Canadian government had come up with an ingenious and risky operation in saving and extracting the six from Tehran from which even a bird would not be able to fly undetected. The film depicts in details the operation that for long 18 years remained classified. I would not argue that ""Argo"" may not be historically absolutely accurate but am not going to blame its creators for that. ""Argo"" turns to be a fascinating piece of cinema and a very timely film, despite the fact that the story it tells took place over 30 years ago.For many years, Ben Affleck was for me a lesser part of the creative and friendly alliance with Matt Damon. Matt was ""Talented Mr. Damon,"" and Ben - mostly, a pretty boy whose acting career hit the rock bottom with ""Gigli"", and who became famous as the first syllable in the created by media frenzy compound word Bennifer. I am happy to admit that I was wrong about Benjamin Geza Affleck. Well, he is still the first syllable in the compound word Bennifer, with the different Jennifer though, but he's got real talent as the film director with the sharp clear vision, undeniable craft, and confident style of directing. Ben Affleck is gradually becoming one of my favorite American directors: ""Gone Baby Gone"", ""The Town"", and now - ""Argo."" The latter is without doubt his best work so far and I highly recommend it. I would not be surprised at all that when the awards season arrives, both ""Argo"" and Affleck will be mentioned as the nominees for several prestigious awards. The film has a lot going for it. One remarkable scene follows another. From the first frames, ""Argo's director creates unbearable tension, pulls the viewer inside the screen and holds them there until the end. One of my favorite scenes has Tony Mendes (Affleck) riding a cab from the Airport upon his arrival to Tehran. Pay close attention to what he sees and how short cuts form the streets of Tehran intertwined. For this scene alone, I believe Affleck deserves nomination for directing.Pay attention how the tone of the film changes with the Hollywood scenes and how much of professional knowledge of starting the film production details Affleck uses. Making two fine actors John Goodman and Alan Arkin playing the roles of two prominent film personalities who agreed to take part in rescue operation from Hollywood, brings real humor in the dramatic and intense story. The final part of the film is purest Hollywood of its best times when the tension becomes unbearable, and I say this with admiration, because these scenes do not depend on the dizzying special effects, but on the pulsing pace, intense interaction among the characters and their emotions, and the flawless editing that cuts among several scenes occurring simultaneously in different and distant from each other, parts of the globe. While watching the film, especially the final chapters, you squeeze the armrest of your chair hard and clench your fists so the nails dig into the palms.As we grow older, it gets more and more difficult to lose yourself in the movie, which is after all, only an illusion, 24 lies per second. Rarely can a film completely convince the viewer that the line between him and the screen is gone. I am grateful to Ben Affleck for making me forget about that line while watching the best scenes of ""Argo"". I completely trusted him as a filmmaker.I am not going to talk about plot details here. With this film, the less the audience knows about the plot before they watch the film, the better. I only say that bearded Affleck with longer hair looks as convincing in front as he is behind it. Bravo, Ben! I advise you to pay close attention to the prologue of the film before the credits. Affleck remarkably well used animating technique illustrating historical events that led to the crisis of the American hostages in Iran, 1979-1981. Don't leave the theater the film is seemingly over. It is not. For few minutes we are treated to the epilogue where the portraits of actors and their counterparts are compared, and some details of their after Argo lives are revealed.I'd like to add few words about John Chambers, the character played by John Goodman. John Chambers was in fact one of Hollywood greatest make-up artists. His most famous work using the prosthetic make-up techniques for numerous ape -people from the first classic film with Charlton Heston, ""Planet of Apes"" (1968) and the characters of the series ""Star Trek"". Chambers was honored with Oscar for his work on ""Planet of the Apes."" It was the first Academy Award in the category for outstanding makeup. Compassionate human being, Chambers also devoted his talents to help with the face restoration to the soldiers disfigured during the war, as well as to cancer survivors.4.5 of 5 stars - excellent

If you do not understand what the word timely means, it is defined by the Free Dictionary as ""something that occurs or happens to occur in a relevant period of time."" That describes Argo to a tee because we Americans just experienced the national tragedy known as the Death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens (who might have been g/a/y, too) because Obama and Hillary Clinton were too busy ignoring the requests of the U.S. embassy in Libya for added security. That certainly explains why everyone in the Obama administration first tried to insult the intelligence of all Americans by getting everyone to believe that a harmless, little YouTube video was behind the terrorism! Needless to say, everyone in the Obama administration now looks like a bunch of lying liars who told a bunch of...lies as they laughably try to walk back their original blame of the YouTube video.In this context, Ben Affleck's--who's greatest movie role was Daredevil, by far--Argo is unbelievably...timely! It's like Gigli himself somehow saw the future and made a movie about current events...before they happened.In Argo, the plot revolves around the Iranian revolution exploding, and how a CIA specialist comes up with a daring plot to liberate some Americans who have been hiding at the bachelor pad of the Canadian ambassador. Excuse me, now: At this point, I have to leave to get up to go to the bathroom. I will be back in about 20 minutes. (20 minutes later). Okay, I'm back. I'm awfully sorry, but I had a lot of Fresca to drink a while ago.It's clear what Ben Affleck's point with Argo is. He is clearly saying that all Americans should pretend to be Canadians if they are traveling abroad, especially in Iran, just like when the Iraq War was going on and Dubya was in office. See, Affleck's point is that even though Canadians look, act and sound just like Americans (except for their mispronunciation of words like ""out"" and ""about""), the whole world loves them because they are very dull people who secretly hate all Americans. In Affleck's film, this theme is brought to the forefront when the ""evil"" Americans are persecuted by the Islamonazi Iranians and take refuge in the apartment of the canuck ambassador. The movie, in my humble opinion, takes an outlandish turn when the Americans are secretly smuggled out of Iran by hiding in maple syrup jars that Iran happened to be exporting to North Korea.Still, this movie was very riveting and highly intelligent. I can't believe that Ben Affleck is such a mature filmmaker now, especially when he was such a massive box-office star with his monster hits like Gigli and Daredevil just a few years back! Oh well, if he is now able to produce such sharply insightful films like this--where the main message is how Canadians are loved by the whole world for nothing more than hating Americans while failing to produce anything of significance in their whole country's history--then I want to nominate Ben for best director at next year's Tonys.",5,Ben Affleck 4 Life!!!!,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,3087,"['Argo', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Fargo', 'Esso', 'gas', 'station', 'one', 'hell', 'timely', 'hell', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'word', 'timely', 'defined', 'Free', 'Dictionary', 'something', 'occur', 'relevant', 'period', 'time', 'Argo', 'tee', 'Americans', 'just', 'experienced', 'national', 'tragedy', 'known', 'Death', 'Ambassador', 'Christopher', 'Stevens', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'g/a/y', 'too', 'Obama', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'ignoring', 'requests', 'U.S.', 'embassy', 'Libya', 'added', 'security', 'certainly', 'why', 'everyone', 'Obama', 'administration', 'first', 'tried', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'Americans', 'getting', 'everyone', 'believe', 'harmless', 'little', 'YouTube', 'video', 'was', 'terrorism', 'Needless', 'say', 'everyone', 'Obama', 'administration', 'now', 'bunch', 'lying', 'liars', 'who', 'told', 'bunch', 'laughably', 'try', 'walk', 'back', 'original', 'blame', 'YouTube', 'video.In', 'context', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'greatest', 'movie', 'role', 'was', 'Daredevil', 'far', 'Argo', 'unbelievably', 'timely', 'Gigli', 'somehow', 'saw', 'future', 'made', 'movie', 'current', 'events', 'happened.In', 'Argo', 'plot', 'Iranian', 'revolution', 'exploding', 'how', 'CIA', 'specialist', 'up', 'daring', 'plot', 'liberate', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'hiding', 'bachelor', 'pad', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'now', 'point', 'have', 'leave', 'get', 'up', 'go', 'bathroom', 'will', 'be', 'back', '20', 'minutes', '20', 'minutes', 'later', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'back', ""'m"", 'awfully', 'sorry', 'had', 'lot', 'Fresca', 'drink', 'while', 'ago.It', 'clear', 'what', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'point', 'Argo', 'clearly', 'saying', 'Americans', 'should', 'pretend', 'be', 'Canadians', 'are', 'traveling', 'abroad', 'especially', 'Iran', 'just', 'when', 'Iraq', 'War', 'was', 'going', 'Dubya', 'was', 'office', 'See', 'Affleck', 'point', 'even', 'Canadians', 'look', 'act', 'sound', 'just', 'Americans', 'mispronunciation', 'words', 'whole', 'world', 'are', 'very', 'dull', 'people', 'who', 'secretly', 'hate', 'Americans', 'Affleck', 'film', 'theme', 'brought', 'forefront', 'when', 'evil', 'Americans', 'are', 'persecuted', 'Islamonazi', 'Iranians', 'take', 'refuge', 'apartment', 'canuck', 'ambassador', 'movie', 'humble', 'opinion', 'outlandish', 'turn', 'when', 'Americans', 'are', 'secretly', 'smuggled', 'Iran', 'hiding', 'maple', 'syrup', 'jars', 'Iran', 'happened', 'be', 'exporting', 'North', 'Korea.Still', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'riveting', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'such', 'mature', 'filmmaker', 'now', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'such', 'massive', 'box-office', 'star', 'monster', 'hits', 'Gigli', 'Daredevil', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Oh', 'well', 'now', 'able', 'produce', 'such', 'sharply', 'insightful', 'films', 'where', 'main', 'message', 'how', 'Canadians', 'are', 'loved', 'whole', 'world', 'nothing', 'more', 'hating', 'Americans', 'failing', 'produce', 'anything', 'significance', 'whole', 'country', 'history', 'then', 'want', 'nominate', 'Ben', 'best', 'director', 'next', 'year', 'Tonys']",Argo

Then it hit HBO & I watched it again. And again. AND again.

Is it completely historically accurate? No. But it captures the mood & the emotions that surronded this hostage drama.It would be difficult to make a movie about a group of people trapped in a house for months, hoping they won;t be caught or executed (or kill each other from the closeness & tension).So scenes were added & conjecture has its place. Ben is supposed to be a low key but intense kind of guy. You don;t do what he did for the CIA if you are an emotional showy kinda guy. That gets you killed. That gets your people killed. So his acting was spot on for the role. All of the supporting actors are good. And there is a surprising amount of humor in the movie -- as in real life you cannot deal with such awfulness without some sense of humor or the absurd. So the movie felt ""real"". Many such stories leave out all humor and that simply isn;t how people survive. It may be ""black"" humor but it is humor nonetheless. Of course the HollyWood scenes lend themselves best to the humor & the Political scenes lend themselves best to the absurd (that hasn't changed)but even with the hostages -- a simple line here and there makes the case for how people use humor to cope.

This based-on-a-true-story film provides fascinating insight into the real-life events that occurred when six American employees of the embassy in Iran were forced to hide out after the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1980.I'm old enough to remember the crisis itself when 52 employees of the American embassy in Iran were taken hostage.  What I had not heard about was the six Americans who escaped and were provided with refuge by the Canadian ambassador.

1501056,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005S9ELM6,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","There is so much hype regarding the Oscars now that viewing any of the contenders is met with confusion. That is unfair to each of the films because it automatically places each in a police lineup for who is going to win. ARGO is a solid film based on a true incident and the significance of that very important mission to free hostages is one equally share with our good friends the Canadians. That is what makes this film important - the courage and fortitude shared in freeing 6 American citizens form a near hopeless situation. But on to the film itself.In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) devised a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts (John Goodman and Alan Arkin, both brilliant in their comedic roles), Mendez created the ruse and proceed to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves.The film opens with a brief but well edited history of the fall of the Shah of Iran and the rise of the Khomeini, actual footage that lends a sense of credibility form the start. For the first hour of the film the plans are set into motion - plans that seem absurdly Hollywood but the options are non-existent. Once the actual exfil mission is begun the film become tense and suspenseful and the cast of characters selected to show both the resistance of the home front and the terrifying situation happening to the hostages in the shelter of the home of the Canadian ambassador makes this a finely tuned thriller.The cast of actors includes, in addition to Affleck, Arkin and Goodman, strong work from Victor Garber who plays the Canadian ambassador, and Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bish&eacute;, Kyle Chandler, and Chris Messina. Though the film was basically shot here in the US (with a bit of footage in Istanbul, Turkey) the action appears authentic. The film was written by Chris Terrio but based on the book ""The Master of Disguise by Antonio J. Mendez and Escape for Tehran by Joshuah Bearman. Affleck directs, produces and stars.

Up till now, we were led to understand that it was by Canadian Ambassador Taylor's initiative that six American diplomats were secreted out to safety through its ambassadorial channels. That was only part of the bigger story that Hollywood got around to telling long after the CIA Iranian file was declassified in the late nineties. While Canada's role is still acknowledged as critical to the success of the plan, the filmmaker felt that it was time Americans got to learn about its contribution to the mission. Sure, there was a lot of chest-thumping in the movie as Hollywood and the CIA collaborated to set up a phony movie shoot that would take a small crew inside Iran to effect the escape. The film covers the main events of this venture from the original hostage-taking, to the designing and hatching of the plan, to the role the Canadians played, to the many close calls at the airport before the Swissair jet finally took off. This was one CIA mission that achieved what it set out to do: outsmart the enemy in their own backyard. As a Canadian, I am still proud, after these many years, of the role Taylor and his colleagues had in delivering these men and women from imminent danger during some very volatile times when being an American could cost you your life.

1501098,AMG88KV31ZIIO,B005S9ELM6,Jack Crane,"[31, 140]","Ben Affleck is one of the worst directors in Hollywood today. Go see anything he makes, and it's guaranteed to be derivative and cliched. The Town is a heist movie. There is absolutely nothing original about it. Affleck ripped off scores of movies to come up with the characters and plot of that film.  Even if you can't remember the names of the films, you can remember the familiar plot elements, even the mood. It's the same with Argo. It's basically your typical ""crash land"" movie. A group of people end up in a hostile land populated by ignorant savages and have to figure out how to escape. The ignorant savages in this film are the Iranians, whom Affleck refuses to give any sort of proper motivations for their actions, history or backstory. He leaves it for self-righteous American audiences to determine these people are subhuman and hate progress. Which is absolutely wrong and indicative of a propaganda film.It is hard to connect to any of the film's characters and by the end, the film loses all credibility with the chase scene on the airport tarmac that never actually happened. You see, these Iranian savages apparently have a modern airport, but can't figure out how to call the tower and tell a plane to stop. It's hard to believe this film ever got nominated and awarded for many awards. While I have made it apparent that I thought the film was propaganda, it certainly didn't help matters when the First Lady just happened to show up to announce the Best Picture award. Seriously, when does that EVER happen?Propaganda movies, even for causes I support, are generally an insult to my intelligence. That is exactly what Argo was. Even if I ignored that, the movie was very mediocre. Better movies with this same plot have been ignored or even deemed terrible? Why does this one get so much attention, especially when the story is altered and fictionalized for jingoistic and entertainment reasons? This is yet another blunder by the Academy, which is continuing to ruin its credibility by giving suspect winners Oscars for mediocre or terrible performances. It's not surprising that ratings have been declining.",1,"Your basic ""crash land and escape the angry natives"" movie from Ben Affleck",1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,2133,"['Ben', 'Affleck', 'one', 'worst', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Go', 'see', 'anything', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'derivative', 'cliched', 'Town', 'heist', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'original', 'Affleck', 'ripped', 'off', 'scores', 'movies', 'come', 'up', 'characters', 'plot', 'film', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'names', 'films', 'can', 'remember', 'familiar', 'plot', 'elements', 'even', 'mood', 'same', 'Argo', 'basically', 'typical', 'crash', 'land', 'movie', 'group', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'hostile', 'land', 'populated', 'ignorant', 'savages', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'escape', 'ignorant', 'savages', 'film', 'are', 'Iranians', 'whom', 'Affleck', 'give', 'sort', 'proper', 'motivations', 'actions', 'history', 'backstory', 'self-righteous', 'American', 'audiences', 'determine', 'people', 'are', 'subhuman', 'hate', 'progress', 'Which', 'absolutely', 'wrong', 'indicative', 'propaganda', 'film.It', 'hard', 'connect', 'film', 'characters', 'end', 'film', 'credibility', 'chase', 'scene', 'airport', 'tarmac', 'never', 'actually', 'happened', 'see', 'Iranian', 'savages', 'apparently', 'have', 'modern', 'airport', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'call', 'tower', 'tell', 'plane', 'stop', 'hard', 'believe', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'nominated', 'awarded', 'many', 'awards', 'have', 'made', 'apparent', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'propaganda', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'when', 'First', 'Lady', 'just', 'happened', 'show', 'up', 'announce', 'Best', 'Picture', 'award', 'Seriously', 'when', 'EVER', 'happen', 'Propaganda', 'movies', 'even', 'causes', 'support', 'are', 'generally', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'exactly', 'what', 'Argo', 'was', 'Even', 'ignored', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'mediocre', 'Better', 'movies', 'same', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'ignored', 'even', 'deemed', 'terrible', 'Why', 'one', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'especially', 'when', 'story', 'altered', 'fictionalized', 'jingoistic', 'entertainment', 'reasons', 'yet', 'blunder', 'Academy', 'continuing', 'ruin', 'credibility', 'giving', 'suspect', 'winners', 'Oscars', 'mediocre', 'terrible', 'performances', 'not', 'surprising', 'ratings', 'have', 'been', 'declining']",Argo

The movie centered on getting the 6 hostages out of Iran.The plot to get the hostages back to safe ground was the best choice of all the bad ideas that the CIA could muster forth.Most of us know the history and how it all comes to fruition but nevertheless up to the very end we are not sure that they will make it off the ground.Great acting especially Alan Arkin, you just have to love this guy.Ben Affleck's acting and directing are superb.The actors who played the hostages were well chosen and the make up artists could not have done a better job.

1501103,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B005S9ELM6,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This film is a complex and complicated story.The first thing to say is that the acting is good, very good, contrasting the tense situation, nerve-breaking actually, and the very calm behavior of most of the six hostages and the placid looking behavior of the CIA agent. Not to speak of the tremendous mental tension of most of Iranian people at the airport and the extreme excitation of some in the bazaar and most of the revolutionary guards. That is well done and very effective for us to believe we are in a real situation and not in some James Bond film.Then the story itself is a very sorry episode of Iranian history, when the Islamic revolution succeeded against the corrupted regime of the Shah who had taken over after the ousting of Mossadegh who had nationalized Iranian oil. The film forgets to insist on the fact the CIA had heavily helped in the coup d'&eacute;tat that ousted the elected Prime Minister. That would have shown how there was a time before 1975 and another after 1975. Before 1975 the US played the cop of the world and after the defeat in Vietnam they became more humble, though not that long. Reagan brought the pride out again. That's what is more or less forgotten in the film that pretends to speak of real events.The film though is quite good at showing the enormous change that started after 1975. In twenty years the world was to be completely transformed. The defeat in Vietnam caused the emergence of strong movements negating imperialism. Iran was one of these though it was hijacked by the hyper fundamentalist clerics of Iranian Islam who imposed a violent revolution with all kinds of coercion against the people who resisted the strict application of Islamic laws, and of course against Americans.The strangest evolution was still to come yet since all those who stuck to a non-market economy were to fall down the historical chute, the flushing chute. The Soviet Union and all their Eastern European block were the first victims and they just fell into the free market economy with a great splash in the world's attentive tension. China felt the trend and changed their policy at the end of the 1970s and we know what happened next. The world was to be completely restructured and economic power was to be completely reshuffled and redistributed.That's in these transitory years of 1979 to 1981 that the hostage crisis in Iran took place. The US embassy was taken over by the revolutionaries and the American personnel was taken hostage, but six had escaped and found refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's residence. The film concerns these six who were in great danger. They were retrieved by a CIA agent sent there as a film producer with the complicity and help of some Hollywood people. That's another change taking place in the USA this time: Americans were ready to serve, even if it was not exactly very good for their public images. Hollywood was on the patriotic side after having been widely against the Vietnam war.That's what I like in this period and in this film. You feel the world is tilting in a different direction though the film does not explain which one since the past is not examined and the future is not even hinted at. But we feel more than perfectly that in-between spirit and atmosphere. The Americans are on the run but they are no longer defeated. They are pulling back in order to revamp their forces. But fear is their basic emotion and that too is a good thing about this period. Fear had changed sides and the USA have had to reconquer their stamina and to try to start getting rid of their arrogance and absolute certainty to be right above all others.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,History the way it was experience in this in-between period,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,3651,"['film', 'complex', 'complicated', 'story.The', 'first', 'thing', 'say', 'acting', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'contrasting', 'tense', 'situation', 'nerve-breaking', 'actually', 'very', 'calm', 'behavior', 'most', 'six', 'hostages', 'placid', 'looking', 'behavior', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Not', 'speak', 'tremendous', 'mental', 'tension', 'most', 'Iranian', 'people', 'airport', 'extreme', 'excitation', 'bazaar', 'most', 'revolutionary', 'guards', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'effective', 'believe', 'are', 'real', 'situation', 'not', 'James', 'Bond', 'film.Then', 'story', 'very', 'sorry', 'episode', 'Iranian', 'history', 'when', 'Islamic', 'revolution', 'succeeded', 'corrupted', 'regime', 'Shah', 'who', 'had', 'taken', 'over', 'ousting', 'Mossadegh', 'who', 'had', 'nationalized', 'Iranian', 'oil', 'film', 'forgets', 'insist', 'fact', 'CIA', 'had', 'heavily', 'helped', 'coup', 'd', 'eacute', 'ousted', 'elected', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'how', 'was', 'time', '1975', '1975', '1975', 'US', 'played', 'cop', 'world', 'defeat', 'Vietnam', 'became', 'more', 'humble', 'not', 'long', 'Reagan', 'brought', 'pride', 'out', 'again', 'what', 'more', 'less', 'forgotten', 'film', 'speak', 'real', 'events.The', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'showing', 'enormous', 'change', 'started', '1975', 'twenty', 'years', 'world', 'was', 'be', 'completely', 'transformed', 'defeat', 'Vietnam', 'caused', 'emergence', 'strong', 'movements', 'negating', 'imperialism', 'Iran', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'hijacked', 'hyper', 'fundamentalist', 'clerics', 'Iranian', 'Islam', 'who', 'imposed', 'violent', 'revolution', 'kinds', 'coercion', 'people', 'who', 'resisted', 'strict', 'application', 'Islamic', 'laws', 'course', 'Americans.The', 'strangest', 'evolution', 'was', 'still', 'come', 'yet', 'who', 'stuck', 'non-market', 'economy', 'were', 'fall', 'down', 'historical', 'chute', 'flushing', 'chute', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Eastern', 'European', 'block', 'were', 'first', 'victims', 'just', 'fell', 'free', 'market', 'economy', 'great', 'splash', 'world', 'attentive', 'tension', 'China', 'felt', 'trend', 'changed', 'policy', 'end', '1970s', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'world', 'was', 'be', 'completely', 'restructured', 'economic', 'power', 'was', 'be', 'completely', 'reshuffled', 'redistributed.That', 'transitory', 'years', '1979', '1981', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'Iran', 'took', 'place', 'US', 'embassy', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'revolutionaries', 'American', 'personnel', 'was', 'taken', 'hostage', 'six', 'had', 'escaped', 'found', 'refuge', 'Canadian', 'Ambassador', 'residence', 'film', 'concerns', 'six', 'who', 'were', 'great', 'danger', 'were', 'retrieved', 'CIA', 'agent', 'sent', 'there', 'film', 'producer', 'complicity', 'help', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'change', 'taking', 'place', 'USA', 'time', 'Americans', 'were', 'ready', 'serve', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'very', 'good', 'public', 'images', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'patriotic', 'side', 'having', 'been', 'widely', 'Vietnam', 'war.That', 'what', 'like', 'period', 'film', 'feel', 'world', 'tilting', 'different', 'direction', 'film', 'not', 'explain', 'one', 'past', 'not', 'examined', 'future', 'not', 'even', 'hinted', 'feel', 'more', 'perfectly', 'in-between', 'spirit', 'atmosphere', 'Americans', 'are', 'run', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'defeated', 'are', 'pulling', 'back', 'order', 'revamp', 'forces', 'fear', 'basic', 'emotion', 'too', 'good', 'thing', 'period', 'Fear', 'had', 'changed', 'sides', 'USA', 'have', 'had', 'reconquer', 'stamina', 'try', 'start', 'getting', 'rid', 'arrogance', 'absolute', 'certainty', 'be', 'right', 'others.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Argo

1501108,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005S9ELM6,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 5]","I remember a ranking list from The Onion's AV Club from several months back about which films of 2012 have the best chance to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. One of the main reasons they felt that ARGO was one of the strongest picks (the strongest being LINCOLN, at that time) was that film award voters have a lot of love for a filmmaker who came up through The System. If you recall, Robert Redford's very good directorial debut ORDINARY PEOPLE beat out better films in 1980 (the most memorable being Martin Scorsese's brilliant RAGING BULL) and the same thing happened again in 1990 with Kevin Costner's excellent directorial debut DANCES WITH WOLVES beating out Scorsese once again in his genre-defining GOODFELLAS. And it's beginning to look more and more like Ben Affleck's ARGO is the film to beat this year at the Oscars, despite Affleck himself not being nominated for Best Director, and there being superior films nominated once again (ZERO DARK THIRTY, DJANGO UNCHAINED to name the other nominated films that are superior that I've seen). Don't get me wrong; ARGO is a very good film, but whether or not it's the BEST film of this year is something else entirely.ARGO is essentially the recently declassified tale of the CIA's project to get six American embassy workers out of Iran during the hostage crisis of 1979. Tony Mendez (Affleck, doing double-duty again as the film's director and star as he did in his previous effort THE TOWN) is one of the best exfiltration people the CIA has, and he's been tasked by his superiors (one of them being the great Bryan Cranston) with coming up with a convincing cover to get himself there and get the six escaped hostages back. With the help of Mendez's friend Jack Chambers (John Goodman), an Oscar-winning Hollywood effects man who's helped him in the past, the enlistment of a cranky old-school producer (a wonderful Alan Arkin) and a lot of smoke and mirrors, they plan to use a low-budget sci-fi script for a film called ""Argo"" to create the proper cover, with Mendez as an executive producer and the escapees as the scouting crew for this film they plan to make in the deserts of Iran. The plan is put in place, but getting these folks out of Iran in the midst of a great deal of anti-American sentiment may prove much more deadly than anyone hoped.While there is a lot to enjoy about ARGO, there doesn't feel like there's much to remember about any of the characters. Mendez, as portrayed by Affleck, is a man of few flaws (aside from being an absentee father) and is played to be the unassailable hero of the piece, and has all of the typical beats of this character. He plays the calming voice to soothe the anxiety of the hostages; he plays the self-righteous anger when it appears that the mission is falling apart; he plays the wounded warrior when the mission does fall apart; etc. Affleck has shown with films like GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN that he has great talent behind the camera, but has rarely been particularly compelling in front of it. The script by Chris Terrio shows that this is his first real film. It has beats of fun and solid entertainment, and there's a lot of nice behind-the-scenes tradecraft being shown here, but when all is said and done, there isn't much gravity to the film. The most entertaining the film gets is during the Hollywood sequences, when Arkin as Lester Siegel and Goodman as Chambers take full control of the narrative, and it gives Arkin easily one of the best and most memorable lines of a film all year. If the film had been two hours of this level of examination, it would have been a much more fulfilling experience, but not as typically Hollywood-level exciting or dramatic. The characters of the hostages (played by the likes of Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, and Rory Cochrane to name a few) are all very one-note; they're either riddled with anxiety or they're angered over the absurdity of the escape plan until everything finally coalesces in the final sequence of the film where they overcome their fears and step up in typical Hollywood fashion.Speaking of the final sequence, THAT deserves all the accolades it gets because there were very few climactic sequences that were able to build and maintain the tension that Affleck succeeds in creating.ARGO, despite its release date of late Summer, strangely had the legs to really intrigue Oscar voters, and has been a real surprise dark horse, even though after seeing the film, it seems almost custom-made to be the safe choice for Best Picture. Films like ZERO DARK THIRTY and DJANGO UNCHAINED are too controversial to be good bets for Best Picture. LES MISERABLES just doesn't seem to be good enough; BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD and AMOUR are too obscure, and LIFE OF PI and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK just don't seem to have the big push. At this point, it really feels like the only two films that are in play for Best Picture are LINCOLN and ARGO. LINCOLN certainly seems like the safer choice, but ARGO is likely to pull the upset.Again, don't get me wrong; ARGO is a very very good film, but it's just not great.",4,"You Go, We Go, Everyone Goes

1501109,A1A535W556ROBQ,B005S9ELM6,James Ferguson,"[0, 2]","I could see Argo being made during the W years. After all, Mendez wrote of his exploits inThe Master of Disguiseback in 1999, an officially sanctioned book after the cagey Mendez was honored as one of the 50 Trailblazers of the CIA. But, in this day and age one expects a little bit more than a homage to Mendez as played by an utterly humorless Ben Affleck.The film had a nice look and feel, and there were some good performances by Goodman and Arkin as Mendez's LA connections, but you don't really get anything beyond an ""exfiltration"" movie here. The cartoonish introduction of the history of Iran and the Islamic revolution was totally unnecessary, but then most of the persons in this film were presented as little more than caricatures, with the overarching story wrapping tightly back on itself in an all too typical Hollywood ending.We jump from the events of the hostage taking to 69 days later when the CIA has finally been called in to get 6 American ""Houseguests"" out of the Canadian ambassador's residence. Instead of a ""good bad book,"" we have a ""good bad plan,"" which sounded like something the CIA would have concocted back in the 60s when Lansdale was the king of ""psy-ops."" Maybe Mendez studied under Lansdale? Mendez has a couple weeks to make a cover for a movie set in Iran, which the CIA used to pull the 6 Americans, who had escaped from the embassy during the siege, out of the country.Affleck reflects little remorse in his characters for having enjoyed a pretty good 80+ days as Canadian houseguests, while their 50 compatriots suffered the indignities of being the Ayatollah's houseguests. In fact, they seem to doubt the whole scheme (understandably), relatively content to hang out with AmbassadorKen Taylorand his wife. The only really tense scene is when the Revolutionary Guard questions the Iranian housekeeper at the gate. The scene in the market, where Mendez takes his fake film crew, felt contrived, as did much of the movie for that matter.Either Mendez had a flair for the dramatic or Affleck couldn't resist jazzing it up a little. Whichever the case, the film felt a day late and a dollar short. There was no real understanding of the situation, no fresh insights. It was like Tony Mendez and the CIA could no longer stand Canada getting all the credit for pulling those 6 Americans out of Tehran, and after 20 years decided to tell the ""real story,"" and Ben Affleck was all too willing to oblige by building a movie around Mendez' memoirs.",2,Tony Mendez and the Argonauts,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,2482,"['could', 'see', 'Argo', 'being', 'made', 'W', 'years', 'Mendez', 'wrote', 'exploits', 'inThe', 'Master', 'Disguiseback', '1999', 'officially', 'sanctioned', 'book', 'cagey', 'Mendez', 'was', 'honored', 'one', '50', 'Trailblazers', 'CIA', 'day', 'age', 'one', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'homage', 'Mendez', 'played', 'utterly', 'humorless', 'Ben', 'Affleck.The', 'film', 'had', 'nice', 'look', 'feel', 'were', 'good', 'performances', 'Goodman', 'Arkin', 'Mendez', 'LA', 'connections', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'anything', 'exfiltration', 'movie', 'here', 'cartoonish', 'introduction', 'history', 'Iran', 'Islamic', 'revolution', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'then', 'most', 'persons', 'film', 'were', 'presented', 'little', 'more', 'caricatures', 'overarching', 'story', 'wrapping', 'tightly', 'back', 'too', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'ending.We', 'jump', 'events', 'hostage', 'taking', '69', 'days', 'later', 'when', 'CIA', 'finally', 'been', 'called', 'get', '6', 'American', 'Houseguests', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'residence', 'Instead', 'good', 'bad', 'book', 'have', 'good', 'bad', 'plan', 'sounded', 'something', 'CIA', 'would', 'have', 'concocted', 'back', '60s', 'when', 'Lansdale', 'was', 'king', 'psy-ops', 'Maybe', 'Mendez', 'studied', 'Lansdale', 'Mendez', 'couple', 'weeks', 'make', 'cover', 'movie', 'set', 'Iran', 'CIA', 'used', 'pull', '6', 'Americans', 'who', 'had', 'escaped', 'embassy', 'siege', 'country.Affleck', 'little', 'remorse', 'characters', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'pretty', 'good', '80+', 'days', 'Canadian', 'houseguests', '50', 'compatriots', 'suffered', 'indignities', 'being', 'Ayatollah', 'houseguests', 'fact', 'seem', 'doubt', 'whole', 'scheme', 'understandably', 'relatively', 'content', 'hang', 'out', 'AmbassadorKen', 'Taylorand', 'wife', 'only', 'really', 'tense', 'scene', 'when', 'Revolutionary', 'Guard', 'questions', 'Iranian', 'housekeeper', 'gate', 'scene', 'market', 'where', 'Mendez', 'fake', 'film', 'crew', 'felt', 'contrived', 'did', 'much', 'movie', 'matter.Either', 'Mendez', 'had', 'flair', 'dramatic', 'Affleck', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'jazzing', 'up', 'little', 'case', 'film', 'felt', 'day', 'late', 'dollar', 'short', 'was', 'real', 'understanding', 'situation', 'fresh', 'insights', 'was', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'CIA', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'stand', 'Canada', 'getting', 'credit', 'pulling', '6', 'Americans', 'Tehran', '20', 'years', 'decided', 'tell', 'real', 'story', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'was', 'too', 'willing', 'oblige', 'building', 'movie', 'Mendez', 'memoirs']",Argo

This time he has tackled a story based on an amazing true event: The audacious rescue of six Americans who found shelter in the Tehran home of the Canadian Ambassador at the height of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. An outrageous scheme involving a fake movie with a fake Canadian crew sent to scout fake locations for a fake sci-fi film, ""Argo,"" was cooked up by a CIA disguise and exfiltration specialist, who, by the way, served as a real-life consultant on this R-rated thriller.These guys make this a nail-biter:* Ben Affleck (""The Town"") is Tony Mendez, the actual hero of this outlandish story, so unbelievable it has to be true. Affleck almost overdoes the way he underplays his role.* Bryan Cranston (""Drive"") is Jack O'Donnell, the profane boss back at Langley, trying to bridge the divide between the needs of his agent in the field and the incredulity of his superior officers.* Alan Arkin (""City Island"") is Lester Siegel, a product of Hollywood: caustic wit, jaundiced world-view, and a world-class BS artist.* John Goodman (""The Artist"") is make-up expert John Chambers, ever the sarcastic conniver, he is Mendez's link to the make-believe world that is essential to the success of this haywire idea.* Victor Garber (LOTS of TV) is Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor who, along with his courageous wife, shelters these terrified refugees week after week. You may be sure the American press remembered to thank Canada for this one!The cast is full of familiar faces, but the six hostages look distractingly real. Director Affleck's flawless blend of newsreel footage, video clips and staged riots make for a white-knuckle experience. Our exhausted screening audience applauded the end, but stayed for the VERY welcome postscripts about the participants.This is an excellent film based on a painful time in the recent past that many of us remember very, very well.

When our embassy in Tehran, Iran is stormed by Ayatollah Khomeini's followers, six staffers snuck out the back door and hid in the Canadian ambassador's house during the commotion.  The State Department keeps coming up with one bad idea after another on how to get them out, untilexfiltration expert Tony Mendez, after talking to his son on the phone about the kid's TV choices, hatches the only viable option: claim that the staffers are a Canadian film crew scouting locations for aStar Warsknockoff called ""Argo.""  As there's a Persian community in Los Angeles that could report back to Iran that no such production exists if one of their relatives called to check, this requires the enlistment ofStar Trekmakeup technician John Chambers to build up an elaborate cover legend of not only the production company but also the requisite press publicity to make it all plausible...and all while the Revolutionary Guard are going door-to-door executing anyone who is saying nice things about the US.Simultaneously tense and hilarious, this dramatization of this audacious black op that earned Mendez the CIA's answer to the Medal Of Honor and had to be kept classified in order to prevent retaliation against the hostages they already held is definitely worthy of all its critical accolades.  The recovering Tom Clancy fanboy in me enjoyed the old-school spycraft angle, and the Hollywood power player-in-waiting in me reveled in the portions in LA where Mendez, Chambers and the producer they enlist to make it plausible wheel, deal and scam their way to that end, such as staging an in-costume table read for the benefit of the press just to have something in the trades that the Iranians could look at.

Bryan Cranston also turns up as the CIA officer overseeing the operation.Alan Arkin's character's reply to a journo, when asked about Argo, is really comically appropriate. I chuckled over it several times. This Argo idea - it is so off the wall that it just might work. Does it? Everything in the film revolves around this.The tension is ratcheted up in several places - in particular when the &#34;film crew&#34; make a dry run in the bazaar.Ben Afflek (And George Clooney too, apparently) directed. Well if he can continue making films in this vein, he has a bright future. His acting is just right in this movie too - a nice steady pace playing Tony Mendez. Good job.In order to enjoy this movie you have to separate it from the &#34;real life&#34; story. Yes there are important differences to be sure. For example, and it's just one example, the Canadian Ambassador takes a lot of risk. Perhaps an excessive amount. You will have to see the film yourself to see what happens.Enjoy the movie.

1501163,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B005S9ELM6,jjceo,"[0, 0]",Argo is a thriller spy movie in which Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is a CIA agent who develops a plan to rescue six American diplomatic agents that are hiding in the Canadian embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Hostage Crisis. If they are captured they will be killed as spies. The plan is risky and dangerous and getting into the country and back out is very difficult.Tony is asked to review all of the plans put forth by the CIA and they are simply a joke and he rips them apart. He comes up with a plan that he thinks is brilliant but his bosses think his ideas are crazier than their own plans. With things escalating in Iran and every second counting they agree to go ahead with his plan but there is one caveat. He has to lead and be the front man in the mission and go into Iran.....This is a very good film and it provides an insight into some of the secret missions that our government and the CIA are involved in. Ben Affleck just shines in this movie and he is truly becoming a great lead actor. He also directed the movie and it is quite an achievement. If you like suspense and dramatic movies then this one is for you.As you know the movie is based on a true story and it is nice to hear the truth (As Hollywood likes to tell it) about how the six diplomats got out of Iran. In summary this is a good movie with a good cast and I recommend it to you. You should enjoy it as it is an interesting and gripping story.I do think that the cooperation and bravery of the Canadian government and of the Canadian Embassy was downplayed a lot and they should have been more recognized in the film as real heroes and supporters of America during those tough times.,5,"A movie about a modern crisis that is suspenseful, entertaining and worth watching!",1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1667,"['Argo', 'thriller', 'spy', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'plan', 'rescue', 'six', 'American', 'diplomatic', 'agents', 'are', 'hiding', 'Canadian', 'embassy', 'Tehran', 'Iranian', 'Hostage', 'Crisis', 'are', 'captured', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'spies', 'plan', 'risky', 'dangerous', 'getting', 'country', 'back', 'out', 'very', 'difficult.Tony', 'asked', 'review', 'plans', 'put', 'forth', 'CIA', 'are', 'simply', 'joke', 'apart', 'up', 'plan', 'brilliant', 'bosses', 'think', 'ideas', 'are', 'crazier', 'own', 'plans', 'things', 'escalating', 'Iran', 'second', 'counting', 'agree', 'go', 'ahead', 'plan', 'one', 'caveat', 'lead', 'be', 'front', 'man', 'mission', 'go', 'Iran', '..This', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'insight', 'secret', 'missions', 'government', 'CIA', 'are', 'involved', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'just', 'movie', 'truly', 'becoming', 'great', 'lead', 'actor', 'also', 'directed', 'movie', 'quite', 'achievement', 'like', 'suspense', 'dramatic', 'movies', 'then', 'one', 'you.As', 'know', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'nice', 'hear', 'truth', 'Hollywood', 'tell', 'how', 'six', 'diplomats', 'got', 'Iran', 'summary', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'cast', 'recommend', 'should', 'enjoy', 'interesting', 'gripping', 'story.I', 'do', 'think', 'cooperation', 'bravery', 'Canadian', 'government', 'Canadian', 'Embassy', 'was', 'downplayed', 'lot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'recognized', 'film', 'real', 'heroes', 'supporters', 'America', 'tough', 'times']",Argo

Alan Arkin and John Goodman are splendid as the cynical Hollywood team behind the Argo caper and provide some much needed comic relief (""""Ar, go f*** yourself"" is a running gag).I don't know who the actor is, and am too lazy to look it up, but the Iranian security officer who questions Mendez et al at the airport is absolutely brilliant.  Well, everybody is, and so is the entire movie.  During the closing credits, when actual photographs from the hostage incident are shown alongside corresponding stills from the movie, and the actual State Department IDs are shown with the actor playing that role, it's astonishing how accurately the movie mirrors reality.And yes, Canadians are the nicest people on the planet.For suspense, a step back to the 1970s, an heroic story, and a shining example of how for once, the US got something right, Argo is perfection.

I was not aware (or don't recall the news stories) of the 6 Americans smuggled out, so there was some historical significance to me. Ironically, I knew of Tony Mendes from hearing about his book and his legendary status at the CIA. The boldness of the mission itself and the behind the scenes political and administrative machinations were intriguing. Adding to the drama was the ridiculousness of Hollywood in the late 70's (or of Hollywood in general) where a few good men did what their government needed them to without blowing it. Thankfully, there was no TMZ or Perez Hilton back then. Once in Iran, the suspense and feeling of claustrophobia for the 6 Americans are palpable. They're stuck in a house for months, unable to go outside, waiting to be saved or to die. When they're days away from escaping, will the maid sell them out? Will the Iranian citizens storm the ambassador's house? Will the citizens sense that they're not who they claim to be? Will they make it through the airport?

Affleck generates the kind of sustained suspense that one associates with a caper movie, which in one sense it is.

Mendez (Affleck) is charged with creating a cover story for the seven hostages that have managed to escape from the American Embassy during the first few minutes of the crisis. He must spirit them out of Iran under the noses of the regime, and Affleck manages to hold the tension for most of the film.

Argo is an intense, suspenseful, and entertaining thriller.Argo's story and storytelling are great. I was not familiar with the actual events prior to watching this film, but this film managed to spark an interest on the subject. The story in this film mostly relies on its extremely suspenseful situations; I suppose it's even more suspenseful for those unfamiliar with the real story. Along with the suspense, the film also uses drama, action, and even some comedy in a well-balanced and consistent manner; plenty of memorable characters and dialogue. Argo begins with an intense, unforgettable raid, as you can see the fear and worry in all of the characters preparing for the inevitable. The ending of the film, the last 30 or so minutes, is the definition of ""suspenseful.""; it's a dreadful edge-of-your seat finale. The storytelling is tight and smooth; as in, it's easy to follow and doesn't have much filler content. The performances were great. The music really helped create the atmosphere, tone, and authenticity of the film. Also, the credits of this film has a comparison between the film and actual photographs of the events/people, this segment really showed the attention to detail and the aesthetic authenticity; I really liked this. The pacing was fast, in my opinion, and I was fully immersed throughout the full runtime. Ben Affleck's direction was also superb, like in his other two films.Overall, Argo is a beatifully crafted, perfectly executed thriller; the film is suspenseful, thrilling, unique and, most importantly, very entertaining.

1501212,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B005S9ELM6,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[1, 4]","First of all I give it 4.5 stars.  Full Disclosure: I like spy movies, I like realistic and historical movies, I'm tired of silly fantasy flicks and I want more movies like this one!  In my opinion the essence of a spy movie is the ability of the director to get the viewer engaged and empathetic with the characters, and then feel the tension as the possibility of getting caught and punished (imprisoned for life?  Hanged?  Tortured?) is always hovering over everything.  This movie accomplishes that!  It's based on real history, so the story has that extra edge of truth to ground the plot.Ben Affleck plays a very charismatic yet realistic member of the CIA, an ""Exfil"" specialist, who is trying to exfiltrate 6 Americans who escaped from the doomed American embassy in Iran and are hiding out in the house of a Canadian ambassador.  I really like Affleck's no-BS performance.  (I think that he's maturing as an actor and, like Dicaprio and Tom Cruise, is getting very good at playing more serious and realistic roles these days.)Affleck's character (Tony Mendez) comes up with a cockamanie idea to gin up a fake movie production based upon a real script (""Argo"", a cheesy sci-fi film), get some publicity for it from his Hollywood co-conspirators, and go over to Iran as a Canadian film producer.  His idea is to hoodwink the totalitarian Iranian government apparatus that 6 Canadian members of his film crew are on-site with him to scout the film, and then they'll just return to Canada by air.  Audacious, crazy, full of weaknesses, but as the dialogue says, ""It's the best Bad Idea that we have.""  Mendez's Hollywood willing co-conspirators (played delightfully by John Goodman and Alan Arkin) are willing to go along 100% with the ruse, to make it seem as though Argo is legit.  That's the fun part of the film.It's when you are ""in"" Iran that the film really hits home.  It makes you really think that you are there.  The initial scenes of the American embassy getting over-run and the 6 people escaping is gripping.  The scenes of terror in the post-Shah Islamic Republic of Iran effectively convey the chaos, hatred, mob dynamics and fear of a fanatical, America-hating foreign country under Jihadish revolution.  But the movie really kicks into gear when Mendez goes there and actually starts implementing his plan.

On the whole, the film isn't bad -- it's well produced, with an eye for period detail and excellent casting. The actors are all fine, with Bryan Cranston and the six diplomatic escapees-in-hiding turning in particularly excellent performances. Kyle Chandler bears a remarkable resemblance to Hamilton Jordan. The sense of constant but not always nail-biting tension is maintained expertly, even though you know they're all going to get out. There are a couple of flaws, in my estimation: First, as an historical film the movie ignores or distorts real events and people. Second, the hairbreadth escape at the very end is, I'm sure, manufactured just for the sake of the film and strikes me as quite artificial and overly melodramatic.

I'll say to you that when I heard about this film it was getting praised nonstop from critics. I truly was doubtful, myself that the film was actually anything to gloat about. Sadly, I hadn't had a chance to view the film until the other day. I was completely wrong with my pre-thoughts on the film. It is and will be a masterpiece among modern film. I've already bought a copy of it as well. I guess you could call me a bias person, as when I read 'Ben Affleck' as the lead as well as the director for the film, I was kinda repelled. It's kinda hard to like the dude who brought us 'Daredevil', and a heaping of other pretty bad movies. But now I've gotta say that I'm sorry Ben, I should of stuck in there for you. I mean if Tom Hanks can make a few bad movies and then come back with a bunch of good ones, well so can you Ben. Anyhow onto my review of 'Argo'.'Argo' follows C.I.A exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez (Played by Ben Affleck) as he creates a fake film to get six embassy staff members out of the country of Iran, during a large Iranian Protest, which resulted in the takeover of the U.S Embassy in Tehran.The cast of the film is excellent, featuring a turning point in 'Ben Affleck' career. Among the supporting cast we get a solid performance from 'Alan Arkin' playing a character that always seems to be irritated, but as always that kind of character is the perfect fit for Alan. 'John Goodman' plays a makeup artist who assists Tony Mendez creating the fake film, and gives a performance, in which you know John's having fun. And 'Bryan Cranston' is a good fit in the role of Tony's supporter, and supervisor.The script by 'Chris Terrio' is very intelligent. In that, I mean it finds ways to sneak in darker jokes while managing to not come off as odd and or un-necessary, they provide a small smile, but nothing that would change the ever increasing tension the film presents. The dialogue the script has, never comes off as corny, or cringe worthy, everything sounds as if it was stuff people would actually say, not just words put down to explain what's going on. That's something I liked about the script as well. It never explained the main idea of the plot; it just gave suggestions and let you fill in the rest as the film progressed.I have to give attention to 'Ben Affleck' for his outstanding directing in the film, if the Academy Awards don't do it. He found an effective way to not only headline the film but direct it as well, which I feel he did a wonderful job doing so, especially for the opening scenes, which were complete madness.The character development was pretty solid, considering all the madness going on, you'd think you'd never really get to know your characters as anything more than damsel's in distress. But as the film cut to the six embassy people, it showed all their emotions and panic as they slowly broke down. By the end of the day, when the film ends, you really feel for those stranded people, you want them to make it out of that country. And when you start thinking about Tony Mendez, you most definitely want him to make it back to his family, and his lovable kid.The film expresses a strong sense of urgency and tension. I was seriously at the end of my seat as I watched the six embassy people walk into that airport at the end. Knowing that in a flash they could be discovered and imprisoned, or even worse hanged. I was yelling for somebody to pick up that phone when the Guard makes a call to the fake studio Tony Mendez created. The whole film will have you at the end of your seat, not knowing whether or not the six embassy people will make it back to America or not. All together it makes the film even more exciting then the film already is.The plot is great. It's never bland or dull. It's always exciting and original, and keeps you watching, as you never know what's happening until it's happened. The plot, is more sophisticated than most popcorn movies but it will never the less entertain you.If I'd ever seen anything so unique in film it would have to be during the opening protest scenes in this film. When the film starts cutting through the protesters it blends real footage of the actual event into the film, and I found that to be really neat, even if a bit distracting.The editing was pretty good, not choppy, and it didn't cut from one thing to another in the blink of an eye, it gave you a good 10 seconds or so, then it would move on. It all was easy on you.The pacing is actually decent; the film takes a rather slow pace to increase tension in the film. Instead of a high paced film, we get a slow one, which spends a lot more time leading up to the final instead of just jumping to it at any chance possible.All an All 'Argo' is one of those films you just have to love. A film that works hard, and in the end, achieves its goal. 'Argo' is a great film, and deserved the Best Picture award it got at the academy. It just goes to show you not to underestimate someone's credentials on previous failures. Judge a film on its own merits not on previous films. A+P.S: Ben Affleck has two upcoming features. The first 'Gone Girl' and the second 'Batman vs. Superman'. While I somewhat disagree with Ben's casting on the latter film as Batman, as this film has shown, you can't judge until you see the finished project, so I'll just have to wait for that one until July

1501235,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B005S9ELM6,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[0, 0]","""Argo"" is a movie trying to decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Political thriller? A satire that compares Hollywood with Washington D.C. (like ""The Last Shot"")? Or straight based on a true story historical film? It has elements of all but fails to commit to any of them and comes up with a patchwork movie not sure of where it wants to go.After the Iranian revolutionary guard took over the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979, six embassy employees were able to make it to the Canadian Embassy where they were given asylum. Sooner or later the Iranians would discover some Americans made it out of the embassy, so they have to be smuggled out of Iran before they're discovered.Ben Affleck plays (and directs `Argo') Tony Mendez, a CIA operative whose job it is to extricate Americans from foreign countries. His idea is to go into Iran and walk the Americans out in plain sight. He comes up with a cover story that he's a producer of an American movie titled Argo (because the whole world loves American movies), which is a Star Wars science fiction type movie. He enlists make-up man John Chambers (John Goodman, playing another good over the top role since ""Flight""), and Alan Arkin playing a movie producer. They set up a phony production company in L.A., run phony notices of the impending production, and Mendez heads off to Iran. Once in Iran, Mendez faces the Americans, some of whom are skeptical of the plan and are restitant to it. Mendez convinces them it's the only chance they have and takes them to `scout' Iranian locations for the movie, and then walk them out through the airport under the noses of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.Affleck does a good job handling the dual role of actor/director. There's no splashy performances, the acting is uniformly good. There's some tension at the expected moments in the film such as will the Americans be recognized and/or identified as the missing American Embassy employees? Will their identities be compromised by Iraninan employees of the Canadian embassy? And will they make it safely past the Iranian Revolutionary Guard? Even though `Argo' is based on historical events that (in theory) we already know the outcome of, Affleck ably manifests the tension.`Argo' is a good movie, that is enjoyable and has good acting, but could have been a whole lot better if it had decided early on what kind of picture it wanted to be.",4,Argo A Movie in Search of Itself,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,2393,"['Argo', 'movie', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'be', 'Political', 'thriller', 'satire', 'Hollywood', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Last', 'Shot', 'straight', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'historical', 'film', 'elements', 'commit', 'up', 'patchwork', 'movie', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'go.After', 'Iranian', 'revolutionary', 'guard', 'took', 'over', 'American', 'Embassy', 'Tehran', '1979', 'six', 'embassy', 'employees', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'Canadian', 'Embassy', 'where', 'were', 'given', 'asylum', 'Sooner', 'later', 'Iranians', 'would', 'discover', 'Americans', 'made', 'embassy', 'have', 'be', 'smuggled', 'Iran', ""'re"", 'discovered.Ben', 'Affleck', 'plays', 'Argo', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'CIA', 'operative', 'job', 'extricate', 'Americans', 'foreign', 'countries', 'idea', 'go', 'Iran', 'walk', 'Americans', 'out', 'plain', 'sight', 'up', 'cover', 'story', 'producer', 'American', 'movie', 'titled', 'Argo', 'whole', 'world', 'American', 'movies', 'Star', 'Wars', 'science', 'fiction', 'type', 'movie', 'make-up', 'man', 'John', 'Chambers', 'John', 'Goodman', 'playing', 'good', 'top', 'role', 'Flight', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'playing', 'movie', 'producer', 'set', 'up', 'phony', 'production', 'company', 'L.A.', 'run', 'phony', 'notices', 'impending', 'production', 'Mendez', 'heads', 'Iran', 'Once', 'Iran', 'Mendez', 'Americans', 'whom', 'are', 'skeptical', 'plan', 'are', 'restitant', 'Mendez', 'only', 'chance', 'have', 'scout', 'Iranian', 'locations', 'movie', 'then', 'walk', 'out', 'airport', 'noses', 'Iranian', 'Revolutionary', 'Guard.Affleck', 'good', 'job', 'handling', 'dual', 'role', 'actor/director', 'splashy', 'performances', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'tension', 'expected', 'moments', 'film', 'such', 'will', 'Americans', 'be', 'recognized', 'and/or', 'identified', 'missing', 'American', 'Embassy', 'employees', 'Will', 'identities', 'be', 'compromised', 'Iraninan', 'employees', 'Canadian', 'embassy', 'will', 'make', 'safely', 'Iranian', 'Revolutionary', 'Guard', 'Even', 'Argo', 'based', 'historical', 'events', 'theory', 'already', 'know', 'outcome', 'Affleck', 'ably', 'tension.', 'Argo', 'good', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'had', 'decided', 'early', 'what', 'kind', 'picture', 'wanted', 'be']",Argo

1501237,A24ZLCVW2715QT,B005S9ELM6,"Karen Franklin ""Forensic Psychologist""","[168, 213]","ARGO is a well-paced and well-acted movie that takes us back to a seminal moment in modern U.S. history, the 1979-1980 Iranian hostage crisis that ushered in the Reagan era. The film focuses on a little-known footnote, the so-called ""Canadian Caper,"" in which six American diplomats bluffed their way out of Iran by posing as a Hollywood production crew scouting a location for a sci-fi film.The film stars Tony Mendez, a CIA artist and technician (played by director Ben Affleck) who thought up the ruse. He enlists Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman), who won an Oscar for Planet of the Apes and also designed Spock's ears in Star Trek and had helped Mendez upgrade CIA disguises. Aided by a Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin), they mount an elaborate back story, complete with a script, storyboards, posters, and ads in Variety magazine for the bogus movie (Roger Zelazny'sLord of Light).Although the larger landscape of the Iranian revolution is accurately presented, history buffs may be disappointed that the details of the operation itself are distorted almost beyond recognition. Affleck's character looms larger than life, while the American diplomats and their Canadian hosts are poorly developed cardboard foils for his heroics. This slant is not so surprising, given that the film is based on Mendez's 2002 memoir,The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA.But it has earned the film the ire of Canadians, who say it trivializes their pivotal role in the rescue. Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), who harbored the fugitives and was instrumental in their rescue, is portrayed as a passive innkeeper taking orders from the CIA. In media interviews, he has called the film ""total fiction"" and ""absolute nonsense.""Affleck has responded to this criticism by noting that, like many Hollywood productions, the movie purports to to be ""BASED on a true story,"" rather than BEING a true story. ""We're allowed to take some dramatic license,"" he reportedly said. ""There's a spirit of truth.""The distortions do not end there. A second CIA agent who accompanied Mendez into Iran is absent altogether, as are all mention of a series of potentially fatal blunders by Mendez and the CIA. For example, the CIA map showed the incorrect location for the Canadian Embassy where the agents were supposed to meet their contacts. And on the morning of the escape, Mendez actually overslept, according to accounts of the rescue released after the CIA declassified it in 1997.The actual exit was also far less dramatic than portrayed in Argo. As described by Mendez in a lengthy narrative on the CIA's official website, the departure went as ""smooth as silk""; ""The Iranian official at the checkpoint could not have cared less"" about the group's paperwork as he stamped the fake passports and exit visas that allowed them to escape onto a waiting Swissair flight (that was delayed due to a minor mechanical problem, not depicted in the film).Still, While Mendez is overly glamorized in Argo, the CIA is not. The agency is portrayed as willing to sacrifice the diplomats in order to avoid potential international embarrassment.Shane Bauer, one of three American hikers taken hostage by Iran in 2009, tweeted another flaw, regarding its depiction of the Iranian people: Every Iranian except the maid and the Shah loyalists in the embassy lobby are depicted as ""thugs or part of an angry mob.""Yet despite - or perhaps because of - all of its distortions, omissions and biases, Argo still works. It is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is both entertaining and historically relevant.

Gordon,"[124, 150]","Ben Affleck continues to prove himself one of Hollywood'd  best, most intelligent 'mainstream' film-makers.In Argo he manages to combine nail-biting suspense created with a minimum of violence or standard movieaction, a sharp, dark sense of humor about the weirdness of both espionage and Hollywood, and makes a filmabout getting American hostages released from Iran without giving in to jingoism.Affleck even takes the time at the beginning of the film to put the Iranian revolution into a larger context of prior Americaninvolvement and manipulation in Iran's politics, thus making the Iranians' hostage taking horribly wrong, but also somewhathuman and understandable.The story itself is a doozey, and definitely fits into the `you'd never believe it if it weren't true' mold.  Using a fake movie as acover-up for a long- shot rescue operation sounds like a bad episode of `Mission Impossible' (or even `Get Smart').  But hereit is, a part of history.I have only two small complaints about the film.  First, other than Alan Arkin's and John Goodman's deliciously funny performancesas the Hollywood end of the deal, not many of the other characters are given as much texture as they might, especially consideringhow strong the cast is.  Perhaps the fear was slowing down the film with character details, but I would have gladly watched a fewminutes more to know these people better on a human level.More problematically there are a number of key moments where the suspense is trumped up needlessly by throwing in some very""Hollywood"" conceits (coincidences, physical impossibilities, the real story of the climax being abandoned in favor of more overtdramatics,  etc) in a film that didn't need them, a film where the whole point is how real world spy operations are miles from whatwe usually see in films.Neither of these flaws seriously damage a very, very good film, but I couldn't help some minor disappointment when I felt the film go forthe `movie moment' over truth.

Six of the embassy diplomats escape and hide in Canadian ambassador&#8217;s residence.Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA consultant, is deputed to Iran, to rescue the six American diplomats. Tony designs a plot to extradite the diplomats claiming them as a film production unit, exploring the location, to make a science fiction film. Their passports are faked with Canadian identities, with the help of Canadian ambassador, and all necessary arrangements of floating a fake production unit for the film is done meticulously, with the help of Hollywood studios and of course aided by the US Government. The tension mounts when they are stopped by the Iranian revolutionaries in the airport and thoroughly questioned about their identities. The last second clearance of their departure and the final take off of their flight from the Iranian territory back home safely ends the movie with a happy note. Tony gets the highest Excellence award from the CIA for his daring efforts and gets back to his family.The movie pumps adrenaline in the second half when the diplomats leave the Canadian ambassador&#8217;s home to airport. The audience gets really tensed to see how Tony gets them out of the Revolutionary controlled international airport of Iran. The huge relief obtained after the safe take off after a highly nerve cracking security check at the airport is absolutely mind blowing. But none of the six, except one, is shown to thank Tony, for his deadly rescue operation.The negative part of the film is that the activists and the movement in Iran at that time is shown as extremism and highly unsafe for any American national in the country, which may not be the actual scenario. The basic movement and sentiment of the country seems to have been degraded and fear creating for any potential foreign visitor.My rating is 3.75/5",4,Seriously pumping Adrenaline,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,2498,"['Starring', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'directed', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'music', 'Alexandre', 'Desplate', 'produced', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Ben', 'Affleck.Winner', 'three', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'thirty', 'prestigious', 'awards', 'world', 'film', 'real', 'event', 'took', 'place', '1979-80', 'wherein', 'six', 'American', 'diplomats', 'are', 'rescued', 'dramatic', 'way', 'Iran', 'disguise', 'film', 'unit', 'said', 'be', 'making', 'imaginary', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'named', '8216', 'Argo', '8217', '.Iranian', 'revolutionaries', '1979', 'hold', 'American', 'nationals', 'embassy', 'hostages', 'killing', 'demanding', 'extradition', 'Shah', 'former', 'tyrant', 'ruler', 'Iran', 'taking', 'refuge', 'USA', 'Six', 'embassy', 'escape', 'hide', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', '8217', 'residence.Tony', 'Mendez', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'CIA', 'consultant', 'deputed', 'Iran', 'rescue', 'six', 'American', 'diplomats', 'Tony', 'plot', 'extradite', 'diplomats', 'claiming', 'film', 'production', 'unit', 'exploring', 'location', 'make', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'passports', 'are', 'faked', 'Canadian', 'identities', 'help', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'necessary', 'arrangements', 'floating', 'fake', 'production', 'unit', 'film', 'done', 'meticulously', 'help', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'course', 'aided', 'US', 'Government', 'tension', 'mounts', 'when', 'are', 'stopped', 'Iranian', 'revolutionaries', 'airport', 'thoroughly', 'questioned', 'identities', 'last', 'second', 'clearance', 'departure', 'final', 'take', 'flight', 'Iranian', 'territory', 'back', 'home', 'safely', 'movie', 'happy', 'note', 'Tony', 'highest', 'Excellence', 'award', 'CIA', 'daring', 'efforts', 'back', 'family.The', 'movie', 'pumps', 'adrenaline', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'diplomats', 'leave', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', '8217', 'home', 'airport', 'audience', 'really', 'tensed', 'see', 'how', 'Tony', 'Revolutionary', 'controlled', 'international', 'airport', 'Iran', 'huge', 'relief', 'obtained', 'safe', 'take', 'off', 'highly', 'nerve', 'cracking', 'security', 'check', 'airport', 'absolutely', 'mind', 'blowing', 'none', 'six', 'one', 'shown', 'thank', 'Tony', 'deadly', 'rescue', 'operation.The', 'negative', 'part', 'film', 'activists', 'movement', 'Iran', 'time', 'shown', 'extremism', 'highly', 'unsafe', 'American', 'national', 'country', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'actual', 'scenario', 'basic', 'movement', 'sentiment', 'country', 'have', 'been', 'degraded', 'fear', 'creating', 'potential', 'foreign', 'visitor.My', 'rating', '3.75/5']",Argo

1501285,AV4645DYR9KUL,B005S9ELM6,Kyle N.,"[0, 0]","On November 4, 1979, the American embassy in Iran is stormed and held hostage by a large group of activists, all of whom are upset that the Iranian shah, a man with little support in Iran, was held asylum in the United States during the Iranian Revolution. This was a time that led to major anti-American sentiment in Iran, and it was not a safe place to be. Thanks to the Canadian government, six of the members of the embassy were granted a chance to stay safely within the home of ambassador Ken Taylor while the American CIA (and I believe Canadian government) tried to find a way to get these six people out safely. What follows is a tense thriller, one where the audience is left on the edge of their seat despite knowing the way it all ends (surprise, surprise, non-historians, they do get saved). ""Argo"" is a movie that can be argued to deserve the Best Picture award.Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is a CIA ex-filtration specialist, assigned to evacuate six U.S. citizens out of Iran. After failing to come up with many ideas, he gets a sudden inspiration thanks to his son and ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"". His idea is to create a fake sci-fi movie called ""Argo"", and that him and the six citizens would all be members of the crew going to Iran on a location scout. He gains the assistance of award-winning make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and director Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), as well as fellow CIA worker Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston). Eventually, he brings this to the six members (played by Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Christopher Denham, Scoot McNairy, Kerry Bish&eacute;, and Rory Cochrane), who must learn their characters within a day so they can escape believably through the heavily guarded airport.This is a film that definitely rides on its cast. ""Argo"" contains a large ensemble cast, filled with famous actors playing a variety of roles. Affleck, Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin are just a few of the big names tied to this film, and part of the fun in the movie is seeing what famous actor will show up in the movie. This cast is famous for a reason, too, as every actor plays their part well, even the possibly less known actors. Affleck works very well as a trustworthy character (which is in fact one of the major themes of the movie) thanks to his performance, and some of the movie's greatest moments are because of him and his character. The six civilians all are well-acted, too, with their character arc and success at the end of the movie creating not only much of the tension, but a thoroughly heartwarming ending. Sure, the ending isn't a surprise, and it shouldn't be, but the acting and writing of the characters into a likeable group go a long way towards you becoming invested in their success. John Chambers and Lester Siegel are just a delight to the movie (played excellently by Goodman and Arkin), providing a much needed humor to the mix. Lastly, Bryan Cranston gets a moment, too, making viewers familiar with his role on Breaking Bad feel like he's channeling Heisenberg.The plot is well paced, too, and well crafted. The movie begins with an excellent montage that sets the scene for the film, followed by the building of the plan (which is a lot more humorous than it is thrilling, but that helps balance the movie well), then the rescuing of the hostages. The emotion and direction of all of these moments do very well to complement the right tone and the right time. The tense nature of the events and plot of the movie are also excellently crafted. The movie isn't too historically accurate, and shouldn't be taken as such. Still, the setting is expertly crafted to create a tense atmosphere, one that compliments the action of the movie perfectly. Everything about it adds to the thrill: the civilians' struggle to learn their roles, the heated protests and chaotic nature of Iran at the time, the constant close-calls, all of it is technical excellence in making a thrilling movie. It never once matters that they are inevitably saved. Instead, you are worried from moment to moment. The themes of the movie are great as well, with the theme of trust being an especially engaging one throughout the movie.The soundtrack and cinematography also deserve a good mention. The soundtrack is not one of the greatest, but it does well to create the tone of several scenes, especially with a few of the quieter moments at the end. On the other hand, the cinematography is often great. For example, the scene in the bazaar works well due to the way the camera captures the craziness and chaos of the crowded area, and the way the film often recreates famous scenes and pictures helps give the film a bit more believability (in fact, stay for the credits; it shows a side-by-side comparison).""Argo"" is a movie well-deserving of its praise. It is not historically perfect, but in this case, the use of history creates an excellent back drop and complements the drama and thriller aspects of the movie superbly. This movie is engaging to watch and can go down as a highlight of 2012 (at least among non-superhero fans).",4,A tense and well-acted historical thriller.,1377302400,"08 24,

In 1979 52 U.S. citizens were captured in the American Embassy in Tehran and held captive for 14 months. Thirty three years later, Ben Affleck directs an exciting suspenseful thrilling movie titled ARGO,focusing on the escape of 6 embassy personnel that fled out the back door of the Embassy Building before Iranians who were pretending to be students over took the Embassy.Ben Affleck who plays the part of CIA agent,Tony Mendez, has been called in by the top dogs of CIA to figure out a plan how to get the 6 out of Iran safely without jeopardizing his life and the life's of the 6 embassy personnel. While CIA attempts to come up with a plan, the 6 embassy personnel find refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador, where they stay safe until help arrives. Tony Mendez come up with a plan to produce a movie in the Middle East called ARGO by flying there himself, bringing false identities to the 6 embassy personnel, claiming they are part of a casting crew for a science fiction movie. When CIA Mendez gets to the Ambassador's house, he asks the 6 to put their trust in him, but they are terrified, fearing for their lives knowing if they were caught escaping they would be killed. After much encouragement on Mendez part, the 6 agree to put their fate in the hands of of the CIA agent. As the 6 quickly, with no time to waste, learn to memorize there new identities, past present and future, the Iranians are realizing that there may be 6 more embassy personnel out there besides the 52 that they knew of. Time is running out and Mendez has to work fast. The day before Mendez is to pick up the 6 and bring them to the airport returning them safely to U.S., CIA officials pull the plug, telling him to get out, that they can't back up the pretend movie idea anymore. Mendez takes it upon himself to show his heroic side and continue to go through with his plan. As he picks up the 6 form the Canadian Ambassadors home, he fled with them to the airport hoping they can get past all the security.The scenes in the movie were very realistic, a 70's look. Hair styles, big rimmed eye glasses, older cars, even a scene of Ted Koppel as a young reporter bringing us first hand news through a console television.

Most people are probably familiar with the premise by now - 6 Americans manage to escape the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in the 70s when it is taken over (which led to the Iranian hostage crises). Hiding out in the Canadian embassy, they have few options for escape. Ben Affleck's character plays the CIA agent who hatches a plan to extract them - they are scouting locations for a film to be shot there. To make it plausible they have to hire a real director and special effects coordinator in Hollywood, use a real script, and get some press. The premise is loosely based on an actual escape that took place, but the facts are much different than portrayed in this film - the Canadians did most of the work in the real case, with the CIA in a supporting role, and there wasn't as much drama involved in the actual escape.But if you watch this as fiction, and don't get caught up in that, it's a good film. I thought the opening sequence, where the embassy is taken over, was masterful, really capturing the chaos and fear of the scene, as well as the time period. That is really the strength of the film throughout, as well as the building of suspense. Less successful for me were the attempts at character development, both Affleck's and the hostages.

1501326,AX9C10JD538D9,B005S9ELM6,Liviania,"[0, 0]","Argo begins with a comic-book style sequence imparting the basics of modern Iranian history.  I was pretty impressed, because if there is one thing I've learned from FLCL, comic-book style sequences are hard to animate.The Argo leaps into a riveting sequence, when a mob of students breaks into the US Embassy in Tehran - and six employees in a side building manage to escape the hostage situation.  They find refuge with the Canadian ambassador and the CIA decides extracting them isn't a priority.  Then the situation changes.  And no one has a clue how to get them out.  Their best idea?  Create a fake movie and say the six are a film crew scouting locations.Argo does a good job of keeping the tension high, but not so high that the movie is a pain to watch.  There are spots to breathe.  Even before Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) goes to Hollywood, there's humor in the scene where the State Department presents their ideas for extraction to the CIA.  But the majority of the humor does come from the Hollywood scenes.I particularly enjoyed how Argo used period music.  Films set in the seventies tend to go for the same songs.  It's a storytelling crutch nowadays.  Those recognizable bits of classic rock are there, but they tend to punctuate a scene instead of playing out over an action montage.  Late in the movie one song is allowed to play on, and I'm not sure whether I like it or not.  The song is perfect for the scene, but the lyrics are so on the nose that it's hard not to feel like you're being nudged with the clue hammer.I find the real story behind Argo fascinating.  I knew about the Iranian Hostage Crisis from school - and my mom from being alive in 1979 - but I'd never heard about the six.  I enjoyed reading up on the situation and finding out what was real and what was invented to make the movie more dramatic.  Honestly, I think the movie could've dialed back on the invention a hair and been even better.  Many of the added bits stuck out as artificial, messing with the movie's realistic tone.I liked Argo because it's a fascinating story and it was told with style, humor, and urgency.  I can't say whether it deserved to win the statue since I haven't seen many of its competitors yet, but I don't think it's a film someone would regret watching.

1501331,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005S9ELM6,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[2, 6]","Ben Affleck (The Town, Gone Baby Gone) took a true story and made a very dramatic and suspenseful film from screenwriter Chris Terrio's (Heights) screenplay based on Joshuah Bearman's original news article ""Escape From Tehran"".Afflect's choice of dramatic tension and getting some incredible performances, including his own, from this talented ensemble of players was a real surprise. Not having ever been a fan of his acting, more of his writing (Good Will Hunting with Matt Damon), he proved to me now that he not only has the acting chops, but now he can motivate and drive a major motion picture with true passion.The story is about the six American's who back in 1980 needed to escape Tehran because of a hostile takeover of American citizens working in an American Embassy.  Over 60 American people were held hostage for just over a year. It's a suspenseful look at what real terrorism is and was when, with the help of the Canadian Ambassador, a successful mission was executed under the guise of making a fake Science Fiction film Called  `Argo'. Complete with fake spaceships, actors and laser guns!Afflect is the CIA specialist who is assigned to find a way to secretly get six hostages out of Tehran without anyone knowing it. With the help of special effects make-up artist John Chambers played artfully by John Goodman (Monster's Inc., The Big Lebowski) who convinces the famous film director Lester Siegel played sharply and honestly by Alan Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine, Get Smart) to produce and direct this fake film `Argo'. John and Alan are incredibly sharp and witty together on screen.Bryan Cranston (Drive, Breaking Bad) does an amazing job of playing the CIA department chief who waivers from interfering in the rescue to ultimately forcing the president himself to make the rescue a `true'go! Victor Garber (Titanic, Cinderella) gives his usual personal and thought provoking performance at the Canadian Ambassador who takes in these six refugees at the risk of his own and his wife's life. Tate Donovan's (Hercules, The Shooter) plays the nervous and sometimes overzealous leader of the six refugees who must pull off portraying himself as a fake `movie director' in order to keep their cover real.This movie is filled with tension building scenes and nail-biting moments where you are literally speaking to the screen as if (either in your head or aloud) these characters can hear your excitement and pleas for their safety.  Jacqueline West (The Social Network, Water For Elephants) did an amazing job of costuming for this 1979 - 1980 period as did Kate Biscoe (Contagion, Water For Elephants) who did amazing work on the period makeup and hair.`Argo' is a film about a Science Fiction film that really didn't happen, but was made to be real with press junkets, PR announcements and even a fake office of production just to help get the six people out alive during a time of civil war in one nation.It tells an amazing story with amazing performances by a now surprisingly visionary director that is in Afflect. This is not only a piece of history that we all should refresh ourselves with in these uncertain international times, but a film that will literally keep you on the edge of your seat till the last frame.

1501370,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005S9ELM6,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","For those of us alive when the hostage crisis took place in the seventies we've not forgotten what tensions in the Middle East were like at that time. We had a president who showed a weak America and that was played upon by terrorists who had captured and held captive American hostages for 444 days in 1979 through 1981. Most born since those dates have little or no idea that it happened. It's become a forgotten page in history. Not so any longer.ARGO tells the story not of those particular hostages but of 6 Americans who escaped from the Embassy before it was taken. Hidden in the home of the Canadian ambassador, a team of CIA operatives worked on plans to help them escape. With streets to overflowing with hostile protestors and terrorists the straight and easy methods were out. There was little that could be done and no plan seemed fool proof. But one might do the trick.Ben Affleck (who also directed) stars as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who has planned escapes before. A chance look at a trade magazine and a plot forms in his head: pretend that a Hollywood production company is making a science fiction movie and take the 6 people out as members of the crew scouting locations. All it takes is finding a way to make it appear they came into the country so they can be taken out. With nothing but bad ideas on how to rescue these 6 people, this becomes the best worst idea.Mendez sets about by recruiting a friend in John Chambers (John Goodman), the special effects man responsible for the make up in PLANET OF THE APES. He in turn helps Mendez connect with Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a producer of note in the past who agrees to help them set up a fake production company and to find the right script. Everything has to appear on the up and up to convince the Iranian government. A script is found, an office opened, ads posted in the trade magazines and a party with a reading of the movie is even held all to make it seem legit.Backgrounds for each of the ""crew"" members are formed and set up for Mendez to provide each of the 6 still in Iran. They will have to know their cover stories to the letter if the plan is to work. Once Mendez gets the okay and lands in country, this becomes a point of contention among the 6. While their options are non-existent, a few have a problem coming to terms with this plan. Mendez assures them he will get them out.The majority of the film involves the set up of the escape of the 6. The planning, the bureaucracy and the involvement of so many people with so many possibilities of the plan failing are covered. What is amazing is that these details are spun here in such a way as to never be boring or seem like the film lasts too long, unlike ZERO DARK THIRTY. Instead, Affleck has the pacing of the film done to perfection.The last portion of the film involves the group as they finally leave the ambassador's home and head for the airport. Affleck again does a magnificent job as the tension mounts from minute to minute. Whether you know the results of this mission or not you soon find your palms sweating and heart racing as you wait to see if they escape or not.ARGO was nominated for and won the Best Picture Oscar this past year. For once I have to agree with a win in that category. This is truly a movie worth watching more than once. The only sad note is that Affleck was overlooked when it came to direction. That award went to Ang Lee for LIFE OF PI. While I enjoyed that movie as well, I think perhaps Affleck should have edged out Lee. Perhaps one day Hollywood will recognize his talents behind the camera as well as in front.",4,ALMOST FORGOTTEN,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,3600,"['alive', 'when', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'took', 'place', 'seventies', ""'ve"", 'not', 'forgotten', 'what', 'tensions', 'Middle', 'East', 'were', 'like', 'time', 'had', 'president', 'who', 'showed', 'weak', 'America', 'was', 'played', 'terrorists', 'who', 'had', 'captured', 'held', 'captive', 'American', 'hostages', '444', 'days', '1979', '1981', 'Most', 'born', 'dates', 'have', 'little', 'idea', 'happened', 'become', 'forgotten', 'page', 'history', 'Not', 'so', 'longer.ARGO', 'story', 'not', 'particular', 'hostages', '6', 'Americans', 'who', 'escaped', 'Embassy', 'was', 'taken', 'Hidden', 'home', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'team', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'worked', 'plans', 'help', 'escape', 'streets', 'overflowing', 'hostile', 'protestors', 'straight', 'easy', 'methods', 'were', 'out', 'was', 'little', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'plan', 'seemed', 'fool', 'proof', 'one', 'might', 'do', 'trick.Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'stars', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'planned', 'escapes', 'chance', 'look', 'trade', 'magazine', 'plot', 'forms', 'head', 'pretend', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'company', 'making', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'take', '6', 'people', 'out', 'members', 'crew', 'scouting', 'locations', 'finding', 'way', 'make', 'came', 'country', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'nothing', 'bad', 'ideas', 'how', 'rescue', '6', 'people', 'best', 'worst', 'idea.Mendez', 'sets', 'recruiting', 'friend', 'John', 'Chambers', 'John', 'Goodman', 'special', 'effects', 'man', 'responsible', 'make', 'up', 'PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', 'turn', 'Mendez', 'connect', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'producer', 'note', 'past', 'who', 'help', 'set', 'up', 'fake', 'production', 'company', 'find', 'right', 'script', 'Everything', 'appear', 'up', 'up', 'convince', 'Iranian', 'government', 'script', 'found', 'office', 'opened', 'ads', 'posted', 'trade', 'magazines', 'party', 'reading', 'movie', 'even', 'held', 'make', 'seem', 'legit.Backgrounds', 'crew', 'members', 'are', 'formed', 'set', 'up', 'Mendez', 'provide', '6', 'still', 'Iran', 'will', 'have', 'know', 'cover', 'stories', 'letter', 'plan', 'work', 'Once', 'Mendez', 'okay', 'lands', 'country', 'point', 'contention', '6', 'options', 'are', 'non-existent', 'few', 'have', 'problem', 'coming', 'terms', 'plan', 'Mendez', 'will', 'get', 'out.The', 'majority', 'film', 'set', 'escape', '6', 'planning', 'bureaucracy', 'involvement', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'possibilities', 'plan', 'failing', 'are', 'covered', 'What', 'amazing', 'details', 'are', 'spun', 'here', 'such', 'way', 'never', 'be', 'boring', 'seem', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'ZERO', 'DARK', 'THIRTY', 'Instead', 'Affleck', 'pacing', 'film', 'done', 'perfection.The', 'last', 'portion', 'film', 'group', 'finally', 'leave', 'ambassador', 'home', 'head', 'airport', 'Affleck', 'again', 'magnificent', 'job', 'tension', 'mounts', 'minute', 'minute', 'Whether', 'know', 'results', 'mission', 'not', 'soon', 'find', 'palms', 'sweating', 'heart', 'racing', 'wait', 'see', 'escape', 'not.ARGO', 'was', 'nominated', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'past', 'year', 'once', 'have', 'agree', 'win', 'category', 'truly', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'only', 'sad', 'note', 'Affleck', 'was', 'overlooked', 'when', 'came', 'direction', 'award', 'went', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'PI', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'perhaps', 'Affleck', 'should', 'have', 'edged', 'out', 'Lee', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'recognize', 'talents', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'front']",Argo

Instead they managed to escape the embassy as it was being overrun and sought refuge in the Canadian ambassador's private residence.Not knowing how to safely extract the Americans, the CIA struggles to come up with a plausible plan. Finally, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) hatches an extraordinary plan: He'll enter Iran disguised as a Canadian filmmaker filming Argo, a cheesy sci-fi screenplay that has been repeatedly shelved by Hollywood studios for years, and have the escaped American embassy workers play his Canadian film crew. When they're done ""filming the movie"" the plan is for all of them to simply fly out of the country.The rest of the movie is one thrilling moment after another. A trip to the bazaar by the fictitious film crew turns ugly when the hostile Iranian crowd turns on the white Westerners. The final intense scene at the airport sees the Americans suffer one setback after another as they try to board their plane before the Iranians uncover their true identities.The scene depicting the embassy being overrun on the beginning of the movie was especially chilling because the movie was released just weeks after the Benghazi attack.Affleck should be given tons of credit for his directing abilities and incredible pacing of the movie.

It's easy to see why ARGO has achieved its elevated status and why it probably will win a Best Picture Oscar this Sunday.ARGO is one of those flag-waving God Bless America movies that has you rooting for the heroes and gets you emotionally involved.  And that's why Ben Affleck's directing snub is so ridiculous because it's Affleck who is responsible for ARGO's effectiveness.  Affleck keeps the movie moving, preventing it from being dry and pompous, allowing the audience to share in the victims' plight.  Affleck guides his talented cast quite efficiently, including himself and avoids useless histrionics and/or celebrity posturing.  While Alan Arkin is always fun to watch, his performance IMO is not Oscar worthy---Bryan Cranston would have been a stronger nominee.

1501417,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B005S9ELM6,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 3]","""Argo"" is what happens when real life is more bizarre than any movie plot -- which is why it makes for such a good film.  The death of our American ambassador in Libya is a reminder that the geopolitical instability of yesteryear is still an ever-present threat today.Ben Affleck succinctly sums up the state of affairs in Iran: the United States backed a brutal Shah who seeks asylum in the U.S. amidst a revolution and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini.  The U.S. embassy is subsequently overrun by an angry mob, and we experience every nail-biting moment as the crowd smashes through the American embassy's defenses and takes everyone hostage. Everyone, that is, except for six terrified employees who decide to make a run for it.  Part of the thrill of ""Argo"" is determining whether or not the six refugees were better off as a result.The subsequent daring escape plan that ensues is nothing less than a full propaganda assault.  Communication professionals know how this works and it's clear Affleck does too -- the CIA isn't just creating the illusion of a film crew, it's projecting the cynicism of a decaying Hollywood (so aptly on display in the wrecked iconic sign) that lures secret police and foreign ministers with the possibility of money and fame.And so the plot unfolds: a fake director, a fake producer, a fake film crew, and very real stakes. Part of the film within a film's reveal is the appeal of its plot: ""Argo"" is not just a space opera ripping off ""Star Wars,"" it's about the will of the people rising up against a brutal dictator to preserve their way of life. The secret of Hollywood is that every lie is grounded in a basic truth, and it's upon that tiny truth that balances the lives of six refugees and one CIA agent.Ironically, that plot was actually drawn from another film entirely that never made it into ""Argo.'"" Titled ""Lords of Light,"" it was a screenplay by Barry Ira Geller based on sci-fi author Roger Zelazny's award-winning novel of the same name.  But Geller had even bigger plans, enlisting famous comic book artist Jack Kirby to create plans for a sci-fi theme park called Science Fiction Land.In short, even fiction is stranger than fiction.

Chris Terrio's script, based on the memoirs of CIA agent Antonio J. Mendez, has the urgency of today's headlines. This true story of how Mendez (Affleck), working with a real-life Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin) and special effects wizard (John Goodman), created a ruse to get six American diplomats out of Tehran is amazing stuff, and Affleck keeps us on the edge of our seats, with very few sequences that lag even slightly.In its urgency and topicality, ""Argo"" is reminiscent of ""Charlie Wilson's War."" In its breathtaking suspense in recreating an historical incident whose outcome is well-known, it resembles ""Apollo 13."" This is high praise indeed, and totally deserved. Affleck gives a solid, sympathetic performance as Mendez (he also looks great in his hippie hair and beard, once you get over the initial shock). Even more, he fulfills the abundant promise as a director that he demonstrated in his first two films, ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town."" (Interestingly, one of ""Argo's"" producers in George Clooney, another leading man who became a fine director.) Affleck assembled a wonderful crew, including photographer Rodrigo Prieto, editor William Goldenberg, composer Alexandre Desplat and production designer Sharon Seymour. He also has wonderful actors: Arkin and Goodman give delightful, Oscar-worthy comic performances, and there is also fine work by Bryan Cranston as Mendez's boss, Victor Garber as the Canadian ambassador, and literally dozens of others.

It is a thriller based on the rescue of six American diplomats who escaped the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran, Iran in 1979. Following the Islamic Revolution, the US embassy is raided by protesters who demand that the United States return the ousted Shah to Iran to face trial. They held the embassy staff hostage for 444 days, but six of the staff escaped to the home of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). A CIA agent named Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) plans to exfiltrate the six Americans from Iran under the guise of a film crew. He enlists the help of Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) who, along with producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), create a film production that will serve as cover.""Argo"" is essentially a competenet period thriller with a very conventional structure, but it has been praised to the heavens by some critics and criticized by others who see its timing as suspicious. ""Argo"" features some bad Iranians and was released around the time that Western rhetoric against Iran reached a level of belligerence not seen since 1980. Both the film's quality and its politics have been overstated, however. ""Argo"" is not anti-Iranian. It is sympathetic to the Islamic Revolution, though not to its methods, and it places the blame for Iran's troubles on Operation Ajax, the British and American effort that overthrew the elected government of Iran in 1953 and forcibly installed an unpopular Shah to protect Britain's oil interests in that country. ""Argo"" does not focus on Iranians, except to demonstrate the climate of fear, suspicion, and lawlessness that followed the Revolution. Based on what people who were there have said, this seems to be accurate.The facts of the rescue operation have been altered considerably, however, in order to create suspense. In reality, the six, accompanied by Mendez, sailed through the airport in Tehran without incident. There was no last-minute recall of the mission. The fake film crew never scouted locations. The role of the CIA was also enhanced. Those familiar with the operation, including former President Jimmy Carter, have said that the operation was primarily Canadian. The CIA played a junior role. Perhaps these changes are artistic license, taken in order to make the story more focused and suspenseful. But the film claims that the governments of Great Britain and New Zealand snubbed the six Americans, when actually those governments provided much assistance. Why lie about that when the issue is superfluous anyway? The result was condemnation from the New Zealand House of Representatives and Sir John Graham, Britain's ambassador to Iran at the time.There will always be different opinions on how accurate films should be if they purport to represent historical events. Affleck and screenwriter Chris Terrio also took the opportunity to take some light-hearted jabs at Hollywood in the scenes in which Mendez works with Chambers and Siegel to create the illusion of a genuine sci-fi action film entitled ""Argo"". This is the film's comic relief. The producer, Lester Siegel, is a fictional character, a stereotype of the world-weary Hollywood player, presumably included to give John Goodman someone to play off of. I like the period qualities of the film. It has good pacing and kept my interest. But I couldn't help but cringe a little every time I noticed this story being straight-jacketed into a very conventional formula with a lot of stock characters and looseness with facts that aren't always a good fit.",4,"Solid Period Thriller, but Not Always the Best Fit for This Material.",1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,3683,"['Argo', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'third', 'most', 'decorated', 'directorial', 'effort', 'winning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'BAFTAs', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Film', 'thriller', 'based', 'rescue', 'six', 'American', 'diplomats', 'who', 'escaped', 'occupation', 'US', 'embassy', 'Tehran', 'Iran', '1979', 'Following', 'Islamic', 'Revolution', 'US', 'embassy', 'raided', 'protesters', 'who', 'demand', 'United', 'States', 'return', 'ousted', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'face', 'trial', 'held', 'embassy', 'staff', 'hostage', '444', 'days', 'six', 'staff', 'escaped', 'home', 'Canadian', 'Ambassador', 'Ken', 'Taylor', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'CIA', 'agent', 'named', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'exfiltrate', 'six', 'Americans', 'Iran', 'guise', 'film', 'crew', 'help', 'Hollywood', 'make-up', 'artist', 'John', 'Chambers', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'producer', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'create', 'film', 'production', 'will', 'serve', 'cover', 'Argo', 'essentially', 'competenet', 'period', 'thriller', 'very', 'conventional', 'structure', 'been', 'praised', 'heavens', 'critics', 'criticized', 'others', 'who', 'see', 'timing', 'suspicious', 'Argo', 'bad', 'Iranians', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'Western', 'rhetoric', 'Iran', 'reached', 'level', 'belligerence', 'not', 'seen', '1980', 'film', 'quality', 'politics', 'have', 'been', 'overstated', 'however', 'Argo', 'not', 'anti-Iranian', 'sympathetic', 'Islamic', 'Revolution', 'though', 'not', 'methods', 'blame', 'Iran', 'troubles', 'Operation', 'Ajax', 'British', 'American', 'effort', 'overthrew', 'elected', 'government', 'Iran', '1953', 'forcibly', 'installed', 'unpopular', 'Shah', 'protect', 'Britain', 'oil', 'interests', 'country', 'Argo', 'not', 'focus', 'Iranians', 'demonstrate', 'climate', 'fear', 'suspicion', 'lawlessness', 'followed', 'Revolution', 'Based', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'have', 'said', 'be', 'accurate.The', 'facts', 'rescue', 'operation', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'considerably', 'however', 'order', 'create', 'suspense', 'reality', 'six', 'accompanied', 'Mendez', 'sailed', 'airport', 'Tehran', 'incident', 'was', 'last-minute', 'recall', 'mission', 'fake', 'film', 'crew', 'never', 'scouted', 'locations', 'role', 'CIA', 'was', 'also', 'enhanced', 'familiar', 'operation', 'including', 'former', 'President', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'have', 'said', 'operation', 'was', 'primarily', 'Canadian', 'CIA', 'played', 'junior', 'role', 'Perhaps', 'changes', 'are', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'order', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'focused', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'governments', 'Great', 'Britain', 'New', 'Zealand', 'snubbed', 'six', 'Americans', 'when', 'actually', 'governments', 'provided', 'much', 'assistance', 'Why', 'lie', 'when', 'issue', 'superfluous', 'anyway', 'result', 'was', 'condemnation', 'New', 'Zealand', 'House', 'Representatives', 'Sir', 'John', 'Graham', 'Britain', 'ambassador', 'Iran', 'time.There', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'different', 'opinions', 'how', 'accurate', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'purport', 'represent', 'historical', 'events', 'Affleck', 'screenwriter', 'Chris', 'Terrio', 'also', 'took', 'opportunity', 'take', 'light-hearted', 'jabs', 'Hollywood', 'scenes', 'Mendez', 'Chambers', 'Siegel', 'create', 'illusion', 'genuine', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'film', 'entitled', 'Argo', 'film', 'comic', 'relief', 'producer', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'fictional', 'character', 'stereotype', 'world-weary', 'Hollywood', 'player', 'presumably', 'included', 'give', 'John', 'Goodman', 'someone', 'play', 'off', 'period', 'qualities', 'film', 'good', 'pacing', 'kept', 'interest', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'cringe', 'little', 'time', 'noticed', 'story', 'being', 'straight-jacketed', 'very', 'conventional', 'formula', 'lot', 'stock', 'characters', 'looseness', 'facts', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'good', 'fit']",Argo

During the Iranian Revolution a group of younger and fanatic revolutionaries storm the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and take all but six Americans hostage. Those six escape into the residence of the Canadian Ambassador but it's only a matter of time until they're exposed and what begins is a tense thriller in which every hour puts them at risk.Ben Affleck, who also directed, plays the main character, a CIA operative sent in with an unusual cover of being a movie producer who wishes to film a SciFi picture in Tehran. It's socrazy it might work is one of the arguments and it's basically the best of the bad choices. Affleck's character plans to pick up the six Americans and have them become a part of their movie covers for this movie and then escape through the airport.There's a very impressive cast in this picture. Some of them you won't recognize immediately because everybody is in 70s clothes and hair styles (hard to recognize some people through the beards or mustaches). Some of those people were: Bryan Cranson, Ben Affleck (took a couple of minutes to recognize him), John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Tate Donovan, Kyle Chandler and Zeljko Ivanek.As the credits roll you get to see a comparison of the actor who played a particular character as well as some movie shots in comparison to the actual news shots.

The moviemaker made a terrible error in turning the scenario into a documentary rather than provocative drama.

Thus, the two hour duration of the movie were occupied by Ben Affleck who was also the producer of this movie and the fake Argo movie in the story.

Here he recreates a real life rescue which only came to light in 1997.  If you were around in 1979 or have knowledge of history you are already familiar with what is known as the ""Iranian Hostage Crisis.""When the deposed Shah was allowed to enter the U. S., Iranians were none too happy.  They wanted his head in a noose.  As a result, they stormed the American embassy, imprisoning the ambassador and his staff for more than 400 days.  What didn't come to light until later is that 6 staff members were able to escape through a back door.  In this film they were secretly taken in by the Canadian ambassador (Victor Garber).CIA ""exfiltration"" specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) came up with a plan to bring them out by passing them off as a Canadian film crew scouting shooting locations for a faux film called ""Argo.""  Mendez gets the authorization from his boss (Bryan Cranston) and enlists John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) who were real life movie-makers to create the background for the film.Affleck could be fairly criticized for casting himself in the lead, but he is spot-on with the rest of the cast including those mentioned above.  All could be up for Oscars in a few months, especially Arkin.  They add some needed snarky humor to the serious events in which they are involved.

The seventies `taches and comb-overs are spot on. The cinematography is impressive: the grainy, orangey colours look like real original seventies newsreel footage, and you only realise they can't be when a 747 flies overhead tracked on a static camera which must be a couple of thousand feet in midair. That is very, very sympathetically rendered CGI indeed.Ben Affleck has his hands full, co-producing and directing as well as taking the lead role: he is Tony Mendez, a CIA field agent who specialises in ""exfiltration"" of vulnerable American nationals from iffy foreign situations. They don't get iffier than the Iran hostage crisis of 1979. In a frenetic dramatisation of the initial storming we see embassy staff dumbfounded that their walls could possibly be breached (""but we're technically on American soil!"") and stunned that the Iranian police wouldn't come to sort the situation out for them.Ultimately 52 of the American Embassy staff were caught and held hostage for 444 days. What is less well-known is that six others had the bright idea of scarpering out the back door as the students stormed the front, escaping to the questionable sanctuary of a foreign city of 4 million people whom would like nothing better than ""to pour American blood on their cornflakes"".Having been turned away by the Brits, the Swedes and the Kiwis they wind up as reluctant house guests of the only westerners who'll take them in: the Canadian ambassador and his wife.Meanwhile, back in Quantico, CIA subsection chief Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) is put in charge of working out what to do now. His best guy is Mendez. Mendez' idea, even though the best by a long shot, is a total stinker: have the six pretend to be a Canadian film crew scouting for locations for a sci fi movie, in revolutionary Iran. It beat ""cycling 300 mountainous miles to the Turkish border in the middle of winter"", which was the other option.Early stages are worked as a skilful drama: There is a clever juxtaposition of the Iranian students' trumped up show trial of the American hostages on spying against a public script reading in Hollywood for the titular sci fi film. The preparation for the phoney film is a comedy masterclass from John Goodman and Alan Arkin as a pair of Hollywood old hands brought in to make a credible backstory.Affleck is the epitome of the no nonsense, unflappable field agent. He also rocks superb facial hair that he really should keep.Despite the machinations of the State Department, the film caper never quite gets nixed, and Mendez goes in to Tehran. Now the film enters overdrive: the Iranians have twigged that six diplomats are missing and are running down every angle. We fret that the Canadians' domestic help may have twigged too, and spilled beans. It becomes a race against the clock, with a couple of great set pieces, one of which is in Tehran's grand bazaar (deputised for by Istanbul's bazaar, which withTaken 2andSkyfallhas hosted its fair share of blockbusters recently).Affleck's depiction of the Iranian revolutionaries is sympathetic (that is, more ""Arrec Barwin"" than Spottiswood), it being made clear at the outset that the real villain was the Shah, his presence on American soil being what precipitated the situation in the first place.There are the odd unnecessary tropes: a daybreak shot of the grand mosque as the Muezzin calls the faithful to prayer makes an uncalled-for appearance, and Affleck can't resist the temptation to over-cheese the ending, but these small faults aside, with a fine ensemble cast ably supported by Goodman and Arkin's comic relief, and assured directing and cinematography, this is well worth its two hours' running time.Olly Buxton",4,"Team America, World Police!",1354492800,"12 3,

In order to get the 6 Americans out of Iran, Mendez proposes that they pose as Canadian film makers, who are in Iran scouting for appropriate locations to film Argo, a Star Wars-like adventure. When the various options and alternatives (foreign teachers? agriculture specialists? no, film makers!) are presented to US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, he looks incredulous, but when reassured about the various options available that ""they are all bad ideas. but this is the BEST bad idea we have"", Vance blesses the mission. In order to lend credibility to the idea that he is involved with this fake movie, Mendez and his Hollywood connections set up a fake film company, with a fake film production office, and a fake script, etc. Once in Iran, Mendez gets in contact with the Group of 6, and they are slowly but surely preparing to try and escape out of Tehran.Several comments: first and foremost, this is a terrific, tense and rousing historical drama, the likes of which we don't get to see often enough anymore these days. In fact, the whole movie experience feels like the movie was made in the late 70s (check out the classic Warner Bros. logo that opens the movie). It is equally clear that a number of events were fictionalized in order to advance the drama in the movie (just to name one: the chase to the plane at the end is a complete fabrication but makes for tense viewing). Other missed facts are harder to understand (for example: at the beginning of the movie, the narrator states that the Shah was ""installed by US and British forces in 1953"" when in reality he had ruled since 1941 as successor to his dad).This movie is a tour de force for Ben Affleck, who stars, produces and directs. The days of the ""Bennifer"" ridicule are long gone! ""Argo"" is his third movie as a director (after 2007's ""Gone Baby Gone"" and 2010's ""The Town""), and it seems that Affleck is either incredibly lucky, or simply getting better and better with each movie. I'll bet on the latter. There are several other choice performances in ""Argo"", including Alan Arkin and John Goodman as the Hollywood connections providing the fake film production house, but also Bryan Cranston as Tony's CIA superior. In all, this is truly Hollywood at its very best: a smart, tense, engaging drama/thriller, proving once again that you don't need to have the world blown up in smithereens every 5 minutes to engage an appreciative audience.

Perhaps next year's formula will be to make movies about the best pictures never made, but I think this is a one time, fluke occurrence.I don't know how much dramatic license was taken in the making of the movie; however, I suspect that the dramatic scene at the airport was overplayed in the movie to build to the climax, but I'm not sure the movie could have won best picture without the added excitement as most of the movie develops slowly in order for the audience to understand the role of the various characters.I know that Ben Affleck has some amazing talents, but I think he would have been better off in casting someone else to play his role while he worked behind the camera. Casting his friend Matt Damon might have been too obvious, and George Clooney might have been over the top; however, I can think of several males that would have been more interesting choices (Matthew Fox, Paul Giamatti, Tom Hanks, and Johnny Depp to mention a few 'A' list actors.)Still, it won Best Picture, so that makes Ben the winner.",4,"Good movie, great history lesson",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1418,"['Argo', 'was', 'excellent', 'story', 'revealed', 'new', 'information', 'Iran', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'Carter', 'administration', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'star', 'rating', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'only', 'now', 'know', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'impact.There', 'irony', 'fact', 'movie', 'making', 'fake', 'movie', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'Perhaps', 'next', 'year', 'formula', 'will', 'be', 'make', 'movies', 'best', 'pictures', 'never', 'made', 'think', 'one', 'time', 'fluke', 'occurrence.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'dramatic', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'making', 'movie', 'however', 'suspect', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'airport', 'was', 'overplayed', 'movie', 'build', 'climax', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'added', 'excitement', 'most', 'movie', 'slowly', 'order', 'audience', 'understand', 'role', 'various', 'characters.I', 'know', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'amazing', 'talents', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'casting', 'someone', 'else', 'play', 'role', 'worked', 'camera', 'Casting', 'friend', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'obvious', 'George', 'Clooney', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'top', 'however', 'can', 'think', 'several', 'males', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'choices', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'mention', 'few', 'A', 'list', 'actors', 'Still', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Ben', 'winner']",Argo

This movie deals with the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis in which Iranian revolutionaries stormed the American Embassy and took everyone hostage, but six managed to escape. The movie focuses on  getting those six out before they are captured and executed.The movie begins with a brief history of the region, and how the US and British government had controlled the country and its resources for decades until Iran revolted and forced the Western designated Shah out, but now demanded he return and face punishment. After taking the embassy the CIA comes up with a plan to get the six out. Tony Mendez, the operative who orchestrated the plan, comes up with an idea to create a fake movie and have the six pose as film crew and ultimately get out of the country.The acting is very solid, Ben Affleck and Bryan Cranston do great jobs as the CIA agents fronting this mission. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are also great as the movie producers fronting the fake movie.The last half hour of this film is very intense and nerve wracking, and it will have you on the edge of your seat.

Two others that are more recent 'Carlos', or 'The Baader Meinhof Complex' are simply much better movies.All four of those films maybe are not the best comparison, because they have the advantage of lots of tense action, powerful moments of suspense that go above and beyond what Argo can promise to deliver, and of course those films have tons of hair raising violent moments, which Argo has almost none of. But maybe that is one of Argo's best attributes. It's thrilling, exciting, and nail biting without the need for much any violence at all. There is the ever present threat of violence, but except for one short moment the movie literally has no violence at all.What the film does have is a lot of great actors who know how to act and know their characters well. Ben Affleck has shown here that there is no doubt he has become one outstanding director, and the vibe of the late 70's is caught in time perfectly due to excellent productions values. The script is without question superb, and as much as I love Tarantino as a writer, I believe Argo should have earned the Oscar for the screenplay as well.If I were to compare Argo to another film that would be it's best similar comparison, it would probably be 'All the Presidents Men'. A slow paced, non violent political thriller, with tense situations, interesting dialogue, great acting and characters, and a good script. All the Presidents Men is the superior movie as far as I am concerned but not by great measure. Political thrillers are  still often very good even today, which is why 'Argo', though it deserves the best picture Oscar this year, and it is an excellent movie, I still found my self wishing it was as monumental as some of the other political thrillers I have seen that really are better. In the end Argo is truly great movie making, it's just lacking something more I was hoping for.",4,"Excellent political thriller, while not as great as other classics of it's genre",1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,2611,"['must', 'first', 'say', 'reservation', 'Argo', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'powerful', 'tension', 'filled', 'political', 'thriller', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'Did', 'deserve', 'win', 'Oscar', 'best', 'picture', 'suppose', 'lot', 'different', 'variables', 'today', 'standards', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'even', 'instant', 'classic', 'when', 'start', 'examining', 'comparing', 'other', 'political', 'thrillers', 'past', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'Just', 'off', 'top', 'head', 'can', 'name', 'several', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'intense', 'far', 'more', 'nail', 'biting', 'far', 'more', 'slick', 'powerful', 'first', 'one', 'mind', 'Spielberg', ""'Munich"", 'maybe', 'Oliver', 'Stone', ""'JFK"", 'Two', 'others', 'are', 'more', 'recent', ""'Carlos"", 'Baader', 'Meinhof', 'Complex', 'are', 'simply', 'much', 'better', 'movies.All', 'four', 'films', 'maybe', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'comparison', 'have', 'advantage', 'lots', 'tense', 'action', 'powerful', 'moments', 'suspense', 'go', 'what', 'Argo', 'can', 'promise', 'deliver', 'course', 'films', 'have', 'tons', 'hair', 'raising', 'violent', 'moments', 'Argo', 'almost', 'none', 'maybe', 'one', 'Argo', 'best', 'attributes', 'thrilling', 'exciting', 'nail', 'biting', 'need', 'much', 'violence', 'ever', 'present', 'threat', 'violence', 'one', 'short', 'moment', 'movie', 'literally', 'violence', 'film', 'have', 'lot', 'great', 'actors', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'know', 'characters', 'well', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'shown', 'here', 'doubt', 'become', 'one', 'outstanding', 'director', 'vibe', 'late', '70', 'caught', 'time', 'perfectly', 'due', 'excellent', 'productions', 'values', 'script', 'question', 'superb', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Tarantino', 'writer', 'believe', 'Argo', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'screenplay', 'well.If', 'were', 'compare', 'Argo', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'similar', 'comparison', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'Presidents', 'Men', 'slow', 'paced', 'non', 'violent', 'political', 'thriller', 'tense', 'situations', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'great', 'acting', 'characters', 'good', 'script', 'Presidents', 'Men', 'superior', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'not', 'great', 'measure', 'Political', 'thrillers', 'are', 'still', 'often', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'today', 'why', ""'Argo"", 'best', 'picture', 'Oscar', 'year', 'excellent', 'movie', 'still', 'found', 'self', 'wishing', 'was', 'as', 'monumental', 'other', 'political', 'thrillers', 'have', 'seen', 'really', 'are', 'better', 'end', 'Argo', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'making', 'just', 'lacking', 'something', 'more', 'was', 'hoping']",Argo

They accuse them of being spies. A small group escape and hide out in the Canadian ambassadors house. The CIA want to get them out of Iran . A CIA maverick played by Ben Afflick hits upon a plan to smuggle them out which is ""so crazy it just might work"". He goes to Iran posing as a movie producer for a scifi movie. He brings passports for the hidden Americans. He convinces the Iranians they are scouting out locations to film ""Argo"" the scifi movie and the hidden American are his film crew!Ben Afflick produced this movie, directed it and is the lead actor.

He is director and main character in this film and delivers on both fronts.  Affleck plays CIA agent in active duty in Washington, DC during Jimmy Carter's administration.  From the start of the movie, his character, Tony Mendez, is weary man, living alone in a small apartment apparently in a lot of personal, emotional pain.This is also time when great political changes are happening in Iran.  Former Shah Reza Pahlawi is exiled from Iran in the US and the new conservative religious leader Khomeini takes the power.  Iran is in dis-array and one day civilian riot breaks in.  Crowd decides to break into American Embassy and take its employees hostages.  Only six Americans manage to escape and find temporary shelter with Canadian Ambasador's home.  Their time in hiding is running out and American government creates a secret mission (Argo) to rescue them all from Iran.I was touched by Tony's role in a mission.  He volunteers to save civilians who served US Foreign Service in Ran.  He puts his life on the line.  It all makes sense.  After all, he has nothing to loose.  His separation from his wife and son is obviously devastating for him.  Reasons for their estrangement are unimportant.  It is emptiness and loneliness that is the pivot point of his life.  A man like that is a perfect candidate for the suicide mission.  Regardless if he makes it alive or not, he wins.  If he dies, his pain will finally go away, and so will his isolation and loneliness.  If he lives, he is a hero who has a chance ot reclaim his old life and finally redeem himself.And so the story goes about one man's mission to save lives of six people serving the American government who are stranded in a hostile foreign contry.  I really enjoyed Alan Arkin's role in a movie.  He plays a Hollywood producer who pulls the strings to make a difference simply out of his patriotic feelings for the country and no monetary payoff.  At the end of the film we even hear the voice of the former President Jimmy Carter who explains the secrecy around this mission that kept mission classified for nearly 10 years before public became aware of it.In any case, it is a wonderful film showing the humanity at its best and its worst.  It showcases important part of American history when the Iranian hostage crises took place and how it influenced the following events inthe American political history.

Unlike the botched rescue mission to free the hostages being held by the Iranians, this one was successful.

Mendez is assisted by a Hollywood makeup artist and producer; both played superbly by John Goodman and Allan Arkin.

1501597,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B005S9ELM6,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","****1/2From the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction file comes &#8220;Argo,&#8221; a movie based on a true-life story so unlikely and improbable that it could never have sprung full-blown from the mind of a screenwriter. And if it did, it would certainly never have been green-lit by any self-respecting studio. That it WAS based on a true story made it possible for director Ben Affleck to bring it to the screen and to win a Best Picture Oscar for his efforts.The saga of &#8220;Argo&#8221; begins in the fall of 1979, when, in response to President Carter&#8217;s providing sanctuary for the deposed Shah, anti-Western demonstrators stormed the American embassy in Tehran, capturing and holding sixty-some-odd foreign service workers there as hostages for 444 days. However, unbeknownst to the Iranians - and virtually everyone else in the world - six of the people working in the compound managed to escape to the Canadian embassy, where they spent the next several months in hiding. When the state department finally learned of their presence there, a plot was hatched to get them out and to safety. And this is where things really got weird. It was CIA operative Tony Mendez (played by Affleck) who came up with the bizarre, longest-of-long-shots plan to pose as a Hollywood filmmaker scouting locations for a sci-fi epic he hoped to shoot in that country, passing off the six embassy staff as his crew. In order to pull off the ruse - one fraught with untold risk and peril for all concerned - Mendez enlisted members of the movie industry as co-conspirators and allies, some cognizant of the truth but most not. &#8220;Argo&#8221; was the actual script that Mendez found lying in a pile of discards and around which he wove an elaborate hoax, even going so far as to take out ads in the trade papers in case the Iranians needed a little convincing that everything was indeed on the up-and-up. Like a modern-day Henry Higgins with the lives of six innocent people at stake, Mendez had to train these bureaucrats to act, speak and behave like a movie crew or face possible execution if their true identities were discovered. It was truly a special op to end all special ops, though the full truth of it remained hidden until the mission was finally declassified in 1997.The screenplay by Chris Terrio mines a rich vein of dark humor as it juxtaposes the kitschiness and cheesiness of early &#8216;80&#8217;s moviemaking against the backdrop of a life-and-death real-world event. John Goodman plays makeup artist John Chambers and Alan Arkin portrays film producer Lester Siegel, two of the Hollywood bigwigs whose professional expertise was instrumental in securing freedom for the group. Bryan Cranston (with a full head of hair) and the seemingly ubiquitous Kyle Chandler (having also appeared in the similar &#8220;Zero Dark Thirty&#8221;) provide some of the more familiar faces in a large and impressive cast.There&#8217;s breath-bating suspense as Mendez shepherds his &#8220;crew&#8221; past one security checkpoint after another with the Iranian authorities in hot pursuit. Will they make it to the plane on time, and, once aboard, will they be able to reach freedom or will they be somehow thwarted in their effort?As with most movies based on true events, &#8220;Argo&#8221; faced its share of criticism from a predictable chorus of nitpicking naysayers for fudging some of the facts and for over-dramatizing the beat-the-clock nature of the narrative. Well, get over it, folks; this is a movie, and, as such, a certain amount of dramatic license must be afforded the storytellers in pursuit of their art. And art it turns out to be, a canny combination of social drama and pulse-pounding thriller than never fails to astonish and entertain.",4,"If it weren't a true story, no one would believe it",1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,3752,"['truth-is-stranger-than-fiction', 'file', '8220', 'Argo', '8221', 'movie', 'based', 'true-life', 'story', 'so', 'unlikely', 'improbable', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'sprung', 'full-blown', 'mind', 'screenwriter', 'did', 'would', 'certainly', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'green-lit', 'self-respecting', 'studio', 'WAS', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'made', 'possible', 'director', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'bring', 'screen', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'efforts.The', 'saga', '8220', 'Argo', '8221', 'fall', '1979', 'when', 'response', 'President', 'Carter', '8217', 'providing', 'sanctuary', 'deposed', 'Shah', 'anti-Western', 'demonstrators', 'stormed', 'American', 'embassy', 'Tehran', 'capturing', 'holding', 'sixty-some-odd', 'foreign', 'service', 'workers', 'there', 'hostages', '444', 'days', 'However', 'unbeknownst', 'Iranians', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'six', 'people', 'working', 'compound', 'managed', 'escape', 'Canadian', 'embassy', 'where', 'spent', 'next', 'several', 'months', 'hiding', 'When', 'state', 'department', 'finally', 'learned', 'presence', 'there', 'plot', 'was', 'hatched', 'get', 'out', 'safety', 'where', 'things', 'really', 'got', 'weird', 'was', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'played', 'Affleck', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'bizarre', 'longest-of-long-shots', 'plan', 'pose', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaker', 'scouting', 'locations', 'sci-fi', 'epic', 'hoped', 'shoot', 'country', 'passing', 'off', 'six', 'embassy', 'staff', 'crew', 'order', 'pull', 'off', 'ruse', 'one', 'fraught', 'untold', 'risk', 'peril', 'concerned', 'Mendez', 'enlisted', 'members', 'movie', 'industry', 'co-conspirators', 'allies', 'cognizant', 'truth', 'most', 'not', '8220', 'Argo', '8221', 'was', 'actual', 'script', 'Mendez', 'found', 'lying', 'pile', 'discards', 'wove', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'take', 'out', 'ads', 'trade', 'papers', 'case', 'Iranians', 'needed', 'little', 'convincing', 'everything', 'was', 'indeed', 'up-and-up', 'modern-day', 'Henry', 'Higgins', 'lives', 'six', 'innocent', 'people', 'stake', 'Mendez', 'had', 'train', 'bureaucrats', 'act', 'speak', 'behave', 'movie', 'crew', 'face', 'possible', 'execution', 'true', 'identities', 'were', 'discovered', 'was', 'truly', 'special', 'op', 'end', 'special', 'ops', 'full', 'truth', 'remained', 'hidden', 'mission', 'was', 'finally', 'declassified', '1997.The', 'screenplay', 'Chris', 'Terrio', 'rich', 'vein', 'dark', 'humor', 'kitschiness', 'cheesiness', 'early', '8216', '80', '8217', 'moviemaking', 'backdrop', 'life-and-death', 'real-world', 'event', 'John', 'Goodman', 'makeup', 'artist', 'John', 'Chambers', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'film', 'producer', 'Lester', 'Siegel', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'bigwigs', 'professional', 'expertise', 'was', 'instrumental', 'securing', 'freedom', 'group', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'full', 'head', 'hair', 'seemingly', 'ubiquitous', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'having', 'also', 'appeared', 'similar', '8220', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', '8221', 'provide', 'more', 'familiar', 'large', 'impressive', 'cast.There', '8217', 'breath-bating', 'suspense', 'Mendez', 'shepherds', '8220', 'crew', '8221', 'one', 'security', 'checkpoint', 'Iranian', 'authorities', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'make', 'plane', 'time', 'once', 'aboard', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'freedom', 'will', 'be', 'somehow', 'thwarted', 'effort', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'events', '8220', 'Argo', '8221', 'faced', 'share', 'criticism', 'predictable', 'chorus', 'nitpicking', 'naysayers', 'fudging', 'facts', 'over-dramatizing', 'beat-the-clock', 'nature', 'narrative', 'Well', 'get', 'movie', 'such', 'certain', 'amount', 'dramatic', 'license', 'must', 'be', 'afforded', 'storytellers', 'pursuit', 'art', 'art', 'out', 'be', 'canny', 'combination', 'social', 'drama', 'pulse-pounding', 'thriller', 'never', 'astonish', 'entertain']",Argo

1501599,A1X37MVQFQEGHA,B005S9ELM6,Romanovsky,"[1, 2]","I enjoyed watching the movie. Good acting, crisp dialogue, and grippingplot - what else do we need from a movie that supposed to entertain us? Argohas it all.The film is based on actual events and tells the story of the 1980 jointCIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomaticpersonnel out of revolutionary Iran. Tony Mendez, a CIA operative, sets up aphony film studio that announces a film project looking to shoot in Iran.Mendez pretends to be a film producer, he goes to Teheran and struggles torescue six American diplomats by posing them as production crew.While watching the movie, you feel that some scenes are pure fiction. Forexample, it's unbelievable that the airport security guy trusts Mendez'sbusiness card and calls his production company to find out if Mendez reallyworks there. It's a joke. When you suspect someone to be a spy, you do nottrust his business card, do you? How did the Iranian secret service knowthat the American diplomats were hiding in the Canadian Ambassador'sresidence? Why did they suspect it but never took measures to arrest theAmericans? At least at the airport? Isn't it too suspicious for theimmigration officers when they can't find immigration cards of 6 Canadianswho entered Iran two days ago? How come the immigration cards are missing?If Iranian secret service knew that 6 American diplomats had escaped, whydidn't they inform their immigration department and airport security aboutthat? A friend of mine, who is a professional pilot, says that the scenesof police cars chasing the Boeing 747 down the runway were nuts. It'simpossible for a police car to catch up a Boeing. One more unbelievablething is the 'instant update' on the reservation computer screen in theTehran airport. How could it happen in 1980?The answer is that there were no such things. It's pure fiction forthe sake of storytelling and entertainment.""In reality, the diplomats never appeared to be in imminent danger: the sixnever went to a bazaar, Taylor's wife bought three sets of plane tickets fromthree different airlines ahead of time, there was no confrontation withsecurity officials at the departure gate, and there was no runway chase atthe airport... Canadian Ambassador Taylor noted that, ""In reality, Canada wasresponsible for the six and the CIA was a junior partner. But I realize this isa movie and you have to keep the audience on the edge of their seats."" Taylor isalso shown threatening to close the Canadian embassy in the movie; in reality,this never happened."" (Wikipedia).There are other historical inaccuracies. Besides, the film suffers from poorcharacterization, but it's a modern thriller. The authors have to follow the law ofgenre to keep young audience glued to their seats. Though they should not have mixedtwo or even three genres in a ""serious movie"" that turned out to be neither realcomedy nor serious drama. It's definitely a thriller since ""a thriller thrills"",but not an intellectual one since plausibility is sacrificed for the sake of tensionand suspense.Generally, Argo is a good movie, or at least - entertaining. The story is cooked up,but it is fun to watch. Does is deserve an Oscar? I do not think so. It's good,but not great.

1501614,A387BD735MI50R,B005S9ELM6,R. Schultz,"[0, 0]","I got the feeling that this movie accurately reflected the clash and chaos that prevailed in much of Iran just before and after the Shah was deposed. An acquaintance of mine who had travelled to the Middle East during this period, showed me the dictionary she had had been given to help her translate from English to Farsi. The book had the usual section of ""Commonly Used Phrases."" Next to the standard inquiries helping tourists find a bathroom and get something to eat, there appeared the presumably equally likely question of, ""What time are the executions?""While the apparent need to know how to ask such a question in Iran seemed comical when viewed on the page - there was nothing comical about the reality. The atmosphere that made such a question standard is vividly captured in ""Argo."" We see the tension, the cruelty, and the horror of those days.However, other aspects of ""Argo"" left me somewhat unsatisfied. We don't really get to know the people involved in this fictionalized account of the hostage rescue that took place at the end of the Carter administration and the beginning of the Reagan administration. There are too many individuals represented too briefly on the screen.John Goodman's character is one of the few whose personality does come through in this hectic barrage. Goodman performs the same role here that he performed in ""Flight,"" the almost simultaneously released movie. Goodman is again the lovably cocky go-to guy with a specialized talent. His skill at transforming people with make-up doesn't actually seem to be needed though. So ultimately, his character also gets overtaken by the quick-cut, fast-shuffle pace of the movie.The choppy briefness of each scene recalled the slapping blades of a helicopter - and so actually put me more in mind of the Viet Nam evacuations than of Iran rescues, although no helicopters were actually shown as being involved in this operation. Director Ben Affleck might have done well to learn from the appeal of movies such as ""Fargo."" The Coen brothers aren't as relentlessly driven to ""get on with it."" They understand the value of pausing for seemingly irrelevant anecdote about each of their characters. With ""Argo"" since we don't get to know the people involved, we don't care as much as we might have.Nevertheless, ""Argo"" deserves a high rating for putting the viewer in the kind of heart-pounding, breath-catching situation that all the hostages, their rescuers, and many average citizens were in during this turbulence.",4,"Good at Evoking Place, But Not People",1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,2499,"['got', 'feeling', 'movie', 'accurately', 'reflected', 'clash', 'chaos', 'prevailed', 'much', 'Iran', 'just', 'before', 'Shah', 'was', 'deposed', 'acquaintance', 'mine', 'who', 'had', 'travelled', 'Middle', 'East', 'period', 'showed', 'dictionary', 'had', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'help', 'translate', 'English', 'Farsi', 'book', 'had', 'usual', 'section', 'Commonly', 'Used', 'Phrases', 'Next', 'standard', 'inquiries', 'helping', 'tourists', 'find', 'bathroom', 'get', 'something', 'eat', 'appeared', 'presumably', 'equally', 'likely', 'question', 'What', 'time', 'are', 'executions', 'apparent', 'need', 'know', 'how', 'ask', 'question', 'Iran', 'seemed', 'comical', 'when', 'viewed', 'page', 'was', 'nothing', 'comical', 'reality', 'atmosphere', 'made', 'question', 'standard', 'vividly', 'captured', 'Argo', 'see', 'tension', 'cruelty', 'horror', 'days.However', 'other', 'aspects', 'Argo', 'left', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfied', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'involved', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'hostage', 'rescue', 'took', 'place', 'end', 'Carter', 'administration', 'beginning', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'individuals', 'represented', 'too', 'briefly', 'screen.John', 'Goodman', 'character', 'one', 'few', 'personality', 'come', 'hectic', 'barrage', 'Goodman', 'same', 'role', 'here', 'performed', 'Flight', 'almost', 'simultaneously', 'released', 'movie', 'Goodman', 'again', 'lovably', 'cocky', 'go-to', 'guy', 'specialized', 'talent', 'skill', 'transforming', 'people', 'make-up', ""n't"", 'actually', 'seem', 'be', 'needed', 'So', 'ultimately', 'character', 'also', 'overtaken', 'quick-cut', 'fast-shuffle', 'pace', 'movie.The', 'choppy', 'briefness', 'scene', 'recalled', 'slapping', 'blades', 'helicopter', 'so', 'actually', 'put', 'more', 'mind', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'evacuations', 'Iran', 'rescues', 'helicopters', 'were', 'actually', 'shown', 'being', 'involved', 'operation', 'Director', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'learn', 'appeal', 'movies', 'such', 'Fargo', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'are', ""n't"", 'relentlessly', 'driven', 'get', 'understand', 'value', 'pausing', 'seemingly', 'irrelevant', 'anecdote', 'characters', 'Argo', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'people', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'much', 'might', 'have.Nevertheless', 'Argo', 'high', 'rating', 'putting', 'viewer', 'kind', 'heart-pounding', 'breath-catching', 'situation', 'hostages', 'rescuers', 'many', 'average', 'citizens', 'were', 'turbulence']",Argo

1501627,A6FIAB28IS79,B005S9ELM6,Samuel Chell,"[0, 0]","Hollywood did itself proud to award this perfectly-crafted thriller the Academy Award for 2012.  It's guaranteed to have you at seat's edge, so knotted up that you'll be constantly looking at your watch not out of boredom but to be assured that the unbearable tension can't go on forever.Graham Greene was a writer who distinguished between his deep, soul-searching works and his who-dunnit-style mysteries, calling the former ""literature"" and the latter ""entertainments.""  ""Argo"" definitely shines as a stellar example of the latter.  Unlike the socio-theological examination of life that we get from ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""No Country for Old Men"" (or, for that matter, Shakespeare's tragedies), ""Argo"" pieces together an historical moment with such resourceful precision that we can only marvel at the craft of the director, which manifests a restraint, patience and attention to detail comparable to that of the Iranian children whom we witness piecing together the evidence of what we're seeing from the thousands of strips that have been confiscated from the overrun American  Embassy.In the script John Goodman, while helping Affleck construct the ruse that will permit him to free six Americans, calls directors stupid know-nothings, assuring Affleck that the American posing as a director has the easiest role of all.  At the end of the film, when the plane is finally off the ground, that individual playing a film director approaches the real director, Affleck, and extends his hand as a gesture of thanks and admiration.  As viewers we might do the same.  However it was done, ""Argo"" is at once a delicate balance and an infinitely complex mosaic of small pieces.  Yet, in the grand Hitchcock manner, nothing is wasted, nothing is gratuitous.  Every piece fits so well that for two hours we return to a moment in Iran in 1979.  If we leave the theater none the wiser, we also leave it marveling at where we have just been and what we have just seen.  Acting, spectacle, film scoring--all of these components of a movie are strangely irrelevant in ""Argo."" All we're left with is the film.  There is absolutely no room for clutter.We knew going in that Jason's journey was sheer fantasy and that the movie within the movie (""Argo"") was a sheer ruse.  Yet we need no convincing that the ""Argo"" we've just experienced was as real and believable as a film can be.  If Affleck's Argo played somewhat loose with the facts, it proves no less compelling than the mythological Argo--or the deception that proved successful to the mission.  In fact, the film succeeds because of the believability of 3 Argo's: the mythological story that has captivated readers for many centuries; the film fantasy concocted to contrive a release of the prisoners; the film we have just viewed and experienced for two breathless hours.There are three definitions of film that in my experience account for the compelling power of this art form to strike the sparks of truth from the stuff of imagination.  Orson Welles' ""Ribbon of Dreams"" is not nearly as flimsy and fantastical as it may initially appear.  From the scenario proposed by Affleck's character to the blocking out of characters and action, the entire project hung explicitly on cinema's hold on the imagination, its power to engage the viewer in a willing suspension of disbelief no less ""real"" than the most vivid dream or nightmare.  Second is Jean Luc Godard's definition, ""film is truth 24 times a second,"" reminding us that film in our post-Einstein quantum-mechanical world of the ""dynamic"" comes closer to representing a reality that is always changing, capturing our present experience more accurately than any form that restricts meaning to a ""Bergsonian, knife-edge instant.""But it finally is Siegfried Krackauer's definition of film that brings to film its moral compass while emphasizing the awesome responsibility of the filmmaker. At its best, film has the potential, beyond any other visual form, of being a ""redemption of physical reality.""  The very last words of the film, some of the first from a recognizable public figure, are those of Jimmy Carter, who validates all that we have just seen, providing that final piece of evidence (while satisfying Krackhauer's requirement) that we need to make Argo more than a myth, a story, even a movie.  It's an historical experience, one that has been saved from all the competing ""noise"" in politics, war and history to resonate in our imaginations long beyond the lives of any of its participants, creators, and possibly even later participants.Post-script: seeing ""Argo"" during the Easter season and in view of Krackauer's contention, I couldn't help but muse over film's redemptive quality in relation to the Incarnation and Resurrection.  Conclusion: film can preserve the miracle of the Incarnation, representing figures who appear to represent a supernatural, or spiritual, ancestry.  It cannot however work in the reverse direction, however, suspending the physical and temporal world of experience for the sake of representing the supernatural.  The same lens that verifies the fleshliness of the spiritual is powerless to demonstrate the spiritual component of the physical world.  In fact, there is no film director, no medium, no church, no creed, no book, no tradition capable of making the case for the divine in the material world.

1501654,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B005S9ELM6,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[1, 1]","Ben Affleck's Argo is a smart political drama, an exhilarating espionage thriller and a sharp Hollywood satire, that  not only is a successes at all three, but manages to be among the very best of it's various genres.  Detailing American's first encounter with political Islam, it is also a love letter to the enchantment of the movies and the power that is yielded  the world over by people's fascination and dreams of movie magic.Right from the beginning showing the old studio logo for Warner Bros., circa 79-80, the fastidious detail to the period and the extremes that Affleck and his talented cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto went to to achieve an ""authentic"" look to the film are astonishing. The movie was filmed on celluloid, blown up two hundred times as to allow it a natural graininess. Prieto also manages to successfully duplicate camera movements from pictures of the particular time and era.Taking place in that moment when cinema of the 1970's, when ""movies mattered"" and where cherished personal statements, and the 1980's, when entering the post Star Wars era of special effects and endless sequels. Argo manages to resemble a lost film from the late Sydney Pollack, a movie from that moment in time that like the classics of the era in which it depicts, manages to successfully cross meaningful moviemaking with thoroughly entertaining amusement. It has been cheekily called the last great movie of the 1970's.The strengths in Argo are many, including the way the movie is able to  effectively blend historical fact along with Hollywood fiction, to make an intelligent, electrifying remarkably engaging and funny movie. Working from the crisp and knowledgeable screenplay of Chris Terrio, based in part on a magazine article by Joshua Bearman and on Tony Mendez's autobiographical book ""the Master of Disguise"" Argo chronicles a true life tale that is stranger than fiction, as the clich&eacute; goes.Mendez was a CIA ""exfiltration"" specialist, who  brainstorms an idea that would help free six American diplomats placed in harms way during the Iranian revolution after managing to flee the American embassy before the terrorist takeover. They have found temporary refuge at the Canadian ambassador's home. The CIA's plan  is to send in bicycles for the American's to ride three hundred miles to safety, an operative will be sent in to train them to use said bikes if necessary.Mendez has a better bad idea, using a former agent now working in Hollywood he will set up a fake sci-fi movie, called ""Argo""  and smuggle the Americans out of Tehran as members of the crew claiming that they were on a location scouting trip. To pull this off he must set everything up as fractural as possible, which seems to be the whole feel of the movie, both the fictional and real Argo.The idea comes to Mendez from watching a Planet of the Apes movie, a true life case of monkey see, no? It's hard to distinguishes the facts from the artistic license because we know that the truth is so often this way. I am reminded that after the events of September 11, 2001 that the government did meet with Hollywood screenwriters to askfor their input on terrorist scenarios, to possibly avoid further attacks. I don't wish to know the differences between the reality and the movie reality. I am confident that much of the third act is indeed movie formula, it feels as such, but I don't think that anyone is really going to care because it is so cleverly done and amusing in the process.Argo is one of the funniest and most droll films this year. It understands the absurdity of it's situation, but never resorts to cheap shots or descends into parody. The two major performances here are those of John Goodman as real life make-up effects artist John Chambers, Mendez's contact in Hollywood. Even better though is the great Alan Arkin, as Lester Siegel, a past his prime movie producer with  an abundance of (bad) attitude and sarcastic remarks to easily steal the show and make off like a bandit with it . His foul mouthed, cantankerous geriatric will remind audiences of his Oscar winning role from Little Miss Sunshine. Although I think he is funnier here and gets one of the year's great lines of comic dialogue, it's the one that involves the film`s title, for those who`ll be curious later.The rest of the cast is remarkably fine as well, with numerous strong performances from an abundance of familiar faces including Bryan Cranston, an unbilled Philip Baker Hall, Clea DuVall, Tate Donovan, Rory Cochran, Victor Garber, Michael Parks, Bob Gunton, Richard Kind and a delicious role for Scream Queen Adrienne Barbeau, who was a star in the era which this is set. Affleck is nothing if not a generous director when it comes to his actors.Affleck has had an amazing comeback in recent years, now excepted as a first rate filmmaker, among the finest actors turned directors with his name mentioned amongst giants such as Clint Eastwood, Warren Beatty and Robert Redford. Argo offers Affleck the chance to yet again shine as a leading man, his recent roles have been parts of ensembles like excellent the Company Men and his own terrific achievement the Town. Here Affleck is the star and the anchor to this thrilling and suspenseful true life drama. I'm sure many stars could have played the part, but Affleck is a good actor with movie star charisma and once more is allowed to shine in that capacity. Affleck has earned the right to star in his movie, where many actors direct their favorite star, being themselves,this is Affleck`s first time shining the spotlight on himself.Argo is so accomplished that one never really notices that the story is little more than a routine movie thriller. Or that we already know the outcome of the events. The plot unfolds so captivatingly and Affleck's direction is so masterful that the few weaknesses of the picture are never apparent and easily ignorable.Aided in no small measure because Argo is a gripping story with a concrete strong human center. For two exhilarating hours it manages to serves up a well spun yarn, At time the tension is breathtaking, exhilarating to a point of apprehension. The history plays in such a way to mirror current events and enlighten those of us too young to recall these events as they happened. It is also a very funny and good natured movie full of deserved uplift and celebration of heroes, both real and invented.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",5,it's what makes movies

I understand that there is some controversy over how some of these actual events were portrayed for the sake of dramatic effect in the film versus how the events played out in reality. But look...it wasn't supposed to be a documentary; it's a Hollywood movie. So of course true to form there were some times where Director Ben Affleck self indulgently seemed to make his character the only logical voice in the room while portraying the CIA brass as obtuse and indifferent emotionally to what was being suffered by the hostages.

Every year I like to see the best picture winner though I haven't seen one in theaters since LOTR: the return of the king. They usually either leave me really impressed or disappointed. This one left me with mixed feelings and just very underwhelmed. This whole idea that this is a comeback for Ben Affleck is just pointless. He's not some sort of top tier actor whose filmography needs to be analyzed and held up high. He's done some decent stuff and some not so decent stuff.Moving on I find this time period and this incident to be largely uninteresting. Or at least the way it's presented. Nothing about the time period or setting is presented in any memorable way. There's no atmosphere or tone to this film. The characters are all uninteresting and undeveloped. I don't care about any of the characters being held hostage because we don't get to know a single one of them. There's some good actors here but even Affleck is lacking as a leading man. Take a look at his performance. He shows very little emotion. He just seems to be doing business as usual, making me not care about his mission even more. I don't know I just found this to be very boring. The language was also completely unnecessary, tasteless, and not funny.In closing if this is your type of movie power to you but I need a little more action or a story that's interesting. There are many movies that are driven by dialogue and they don't need action cause they are interesting and character driven. This is not one of those movies to me. It has some good actors, the production is sky high but it lacks soul. I also think it's a mistake to take this movie as the literal truth of the events that took place. Everyone knows Hollywood tends to blow things out of proportion and history should always be questioned and not taken as the complete truth just because someone told you it is.

A Ben Affleck movie that didn't make me want to curse Matt Damon for birthing him into the celluloid world.  ""Argo"" is probably the best movie I've seen this year (har, har), and one of those films -- perhaps because it is a period piece that more than the usual marginally gets a lot of the historical and customary details right -- that is much more mature than many films today.  Well, just about any American film today, where the best we can come up with is teenage girls putting arrows into their less Olympian peers for Donald Sutherland's beardedly sadistic amusement.  Or Hobbits . . . #@!@ HObbits.  Getting out for a movie, let alone a Ben Affleck movie, was not something I'd planned, but the two hours or so of ""Argo"" took me to another world, and that alone was worth the trip.  Affleck directs and stars in this ""based on a true story"" drama about a ballsy joint-Canadian and CIA operation to rescue six American hostages after the fall of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979.  Those of us who know the actual story know how it turns out, but it really doesn't matter, as ""Argo"" ramps up the tension better than most fictional stories.  You'll recognize almost none of the actors playing the hostages, but that's tempered with scene-stealing moments from Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman.  Although some CGI of a 747 is dodgy, the film's only real weakness is a desire to wield silly Hollywood-esque F-bomb dialogue that is too frequently a distraction, the major exception being one time when it is used rip-snortingly to describe the two old guys on ""The Muppet Show.""  I can't say too much  more about ""Argo"" without revealing the whole enchilada, but suffice it to say, I'm actually hoping Affleck will direct another movie soon.  Heck, he can even be in it.

The story itself is unbelievable... but true. The CIA was able to create a fake film, a fake production crew and actual publicity around a fake movie, which they used as a cover story for getting a CIA operative in, and the Americans that managed to avoid becoming hostages.Video:Argo, being a recent film and done digitally, looks amazing. There are no complaints to be lodged against the 1080p AVC encoded video. You may not like the yellow tint used to make the video look a little antiquated and &#34;real,&#34; but that's a producer/director option we can't really do much about. Excellent video throughout.Audio:Dialog drive, DTS-MA soundtrack that actually utilizes some surround effects to enhance the atmosphere and does it well. I saw the film in the theater and was impressed with directionality existing in something that isn't really an action movie and really dialog driven. The atmosphere is reflected just as well at home in 5.1.Extras:Audio Commentary. PIP commentary w/ video and some interviews with those involved in the actual operation.

Escape from Iran - this is an SD documentary made to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the success of the operation.

They are all well done, but nothing truly outstanding (and no real stinkers either!)Overall:Definitely worth a watch.

1501690,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B005S9ELM6,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 3]","With one day remaining before the Oscars, Argo looks set to claim the award for Best Picture. The only reason there is any doubt is Ben Affleck's omission in the Best Director category.Is the acclaim deserved?Well, it's certainly a good film. The subject matter and the ultimate resolution will please many viewers. The acting is hard to fault at any point. But despite all those good qualities, Argo leaves me feeling a little underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because my expectations were so high?The film focuses on the struggle to free six American citizens from Iran, after the US embassy had been stormed in 1979. The six were given refuge inside the Canadian embassy, at great risk to all involved. That's the basis for an engaging story. The reason it falls a bit flat is due to the opening half. We see the hostages escape, but they are not a major part of the story. We are shown a few scenes where one hostage might console another, but there's not enough depth to see them as individuals. We want them to be rescued, because it is the right thing to do, but they could be six random people we happened to pass in a supermarket.Argo is more about the process involved in mounting a rescue attempt than about the hostages themselves, and that process is fascinating. CIA agent, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), comes up with the idea of entering Iran posing as filmmakers scouting for a location. His preparation is thorough, and involves creating storyboards, hiring director Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), and John Chambers (John Goodman), who was to be responsible for makeup. The two set up a fake studio and actually go through the motions of filming scenes.I felt like I was back in 1979 due to the clothing, hairstyles, and generally muted color palette. But, unlike a movie such as Apollo 13 (where the outcome was also known), I was not gripped by the events on the screen for the duration of the film. I appreciate the effort, but I was only truly riveted during the second part of the story and the actual escape attempt itself. There is no need to reveal any more details, because it's better to see events unfold for yourself, even if you know the eventual outcome.I'm probably making Argo sound like a disappointing failure, and that's not the case at all.

1501691,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B005S9ELM6,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","Argo is the interesting, if not exceptionally engaging, true story of a CIA operation to recover six American hostages in Iran during the 1980s. While the details of the mission are often surprising and interesting, history is against this film, as we all know today that everything worked out fine.This leads to many scenes filled with obstacles that we know the characters will overcome. They go through an Iranian bazaar, struggle to get past airport security, and eventually onto the plane to take them out of the country. During all of these scenes, the tension feels very forced; rather than focus on the more interesting part of the story (the fake movie they are supposed to be producing and the actions taken by the US government), we are given lots of 5-minute problems.For example, the hostages are forced to take on new identities in a very short time. What? There's no way it can be done. What? Okay, we'll do it.Argo is full of scenes like this, which by the end become exhausting. There's not going to be much tension or uncertainty as to the outcome of this mission, so I don't know why director Ben Affeck wastes his time and ours on trying to draw that out in the audience.The worst offense is when the hostages and CIA operative are on the plane as it is leaving Iran, and Iranian police cars chase after a plane as it is taking off...surprisingly, the police are unable to stop it. I laughed out loud, wondering if the moment was supposed to be funny or if we aren't supposed to know that cars can't outrun airplanes.One scene I particularly enjoyed was a moment when the hostages' airplane tickets had to be re-sent to the airport; I appreciated seeing the coordination between Affleck's actions (in Iran) with those of Washington DC officials. It's too easy for Hollywood movies to focus on the achievements of one individual, so I welcomed this glimpse of how missions like this requires cooperation from all parties.This movie was an entertaining one, though unfortunately misguided. It's as though Affleck misread what would make a good movie about this fascinating story.",3,Interesting but kind of lazy storytelling,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,2097,"['Argo', 'interesting', 'not', 'exceptionally', 'engaging', 'true', 'story', 'CIA', 'operation', 'recover', 'six', 'American', 'hostages', 'Iran', '1980s', 'details', 'mission', 'are', 'often', 'surprising', 'interesting', 'history', 'film', 'know', 'today', 'everything', 'worked', 'out', 'fine.This', 'many', 'scenes', 'filled', 'obstacles', 'know', 'characters', 'will', 'overcome', 'go', 'Iranian', 'bazaar', 'struggle', 'get', 'past', 'airport', 'security', 'eventually', 'plane', 'take', 'country', 'scenes', 'tension', 'feels', 'very', 'forced', 'rather', 'focus', 'more', 'interesting', 'part', 'story', 'fake', 'movie', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'producing', 'actions', 'taken', 'US', 'government', 'are', 'given', 'lots', '5-minute', 'problems.For', 'example', 'hostages', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'new', 'identities', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'What', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'What', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'do', 'it.Argo', 'full', 'scenes', 'end', 'become', 'exhausting', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'much', 'tension', 'uncertainty', 'outcome', 'mission', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'director', 'Ben', 'Affeck', 'time', 'ours', 'trying', 'draw', 'out', 'audience.The', 'worst', 'offense', 'when', 'hostages', 'CIA', 'operative', 'are', 'plane', 'leaving', 'Iran', 'Iranian', 'police', 'cars', 'chase', 'plane', 'taking', 'off', 'surprisingly', 'police', 'are', 'unable', 'stop', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'wondering', 'moment', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'know', 'cars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'outrun', 'airplanes.One', 'scene', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'moment', 'when', 'hostages', 'airplane', 'tickets', 'had', 'be', 're-sent', 'airport', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'coordination', 'Affleck', 'actions', 'Iran', 'Washington', 'DC', 'officials', 'too', 'easy', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'focus', 'achievements', 'one', 'individual', 'welcomed', 'glimpse', 'how', 'missions', 'cooperation', 'parties.This', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'misguided', 'Affleck', 'misread', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'story']",Argo

There are afterwords postscript to the film by Ken Taylor and a feature Rescued from Tehran with interviews with Jimmy Carter,Tony Mendez and the houseguests recounting their harrowing experience.Inconspicuous pop-corn flick or insidious in it breezy pleasure?

You are not a statesman or an ambassador or a politician or a world leader -- who really gives a rip what you perceive to be our problems in the Middle East?

It is NOT a bad film but it is also a strangely unlikable film as well. I do not know/think I would ever watch it again.  It was coproduced by George Clooney so it is is VERY much a bait and switch film in regards to liberal propaganda.  The majority of the film is a straight forward historical thriller and the period feel of the 70s is very well done---though Iran is oddly non-Islamic.  However at the very begining the film trots out that it was really all America's fault and the script uses the word TORTURE every chance it gets for reasons you would think.  And at the very end just when you think you can leave the theater happy, the film trots out Jimmy Carter who promptly takes credits for freeing the Hostages---which is obviously for people who were not alive during that time since anyone who was knows Carter did not do diddly---which is why he lost the election. In fact, Carter was the crash dummy for the Muslims where they realized they could use American liberals like they use their camels on those long lonely nights in the desert.

1501738,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B005S9ELM6,The People's Critic,"[5, 8]","Towards the beginning of Ben Affleck's latest film, Argo, make-up artist John Chambers, played by John Goodman, says to CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck), ""Even a Rhesus Monkey can direct a movie."" This type of tongue-in-cheek word play signifies a new, and deserved, confidence from the actor turned auteur. Argo is formulaic at best in terms of Chris Terrio's screenplay, but its Affleck's direction and the performances from his cast that raise Argo above the bar he set with his previous film, The Town.Argo is set during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, when a group of Iranian militant revolutionaries storm the US embassy in 1979. However, this film actually recounts a previously unknown and confidential story of six Americans who escaped the embassy and were given sanctuary by the Canadian ambassador. These six are in a unique and treacherous situation of being unknown escapees who, if caught, could be made examples of by irate militants without complicating the heavily observed hostage crisis at the US embassy. Their story becomes the focal point of Argo as the White House, State Department, and CIA all spitball ideas on how to rescue these six trapped Americans before they are discovered by the Iranians. Eventually they settle on a long-shot idea from Mendez, which involves posing the escapees as a film crew scouting locations in Iran for a fake movie by the name of Argo. Terrio's screenplay does a great job of building tension in all the right places, but it does so in a sort of Screenwriting-101 kind of way. In other words, it's predictable.Regardless of predictability, Argo is a deeply involving film. Just because we laugh when we're supposed to laugh, and we cry when we're supposed to cry, it doesn't mean it's a bad film. Instead, Argo is a perfect team effort. At its heart, there is a tremendously powerful and amazing story told in an uncomplicated way, which is just what every good movie needs at its core. Additionally, it is expertly cast with terrific performances from John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, and Alan Arkin who steals scenes as the cantankerous Lester Siegel. Arkin and Goodman head up the fake film studio needed to validate Mendez's plan to disguise the escaped hostages as a film crew. Here, the film adds an enjoyable layer of film-geek enthusiasm. Finally, Affleck outdoes himself as director. Argo has a deliberate and even pace, some historically iconic staging, and camera work that enhances the tone of the film. In fact, Affleck even shows some side-by-side comparisons between historical photos and some shots from his film in the closing credits. His attention to detail brings dimension and realism to the film in a time where real decisions had to be made without the luxury of our modern digital age.Argo is the first great movie of the fall season and delivers as both a historical snapshot and an edge-of-your-seat thriller. This is a very strong effort that succeeds beyond any Rhesus Monkey's wildest expectations.

1501739,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B005S9ELM6,The Peripatetic Reader,"[0, 0]","Argo is a significant film. The most important part of the film is the beginning. In the very beginning of the film, before any action starts,  the narration gives an unvarnished, brief synopsis of Iranian history for the last sixty years. The narration relates how the elected government of Mohammed Mossadegh was overthrown by American and British interests following the nationalization of Iran's oil industry. The narration also relates how the Shah of Iran was installed at the behest of the same governments, and how the Iranian peoples were violently oppressed by SAVAC, the Shah's secret police. For people in the Progressive Community this knowledge is well known and is historically undisputed. This knowledge was certainly not know by the vast majority of people outside of Iran, and most certainly not known to American citizens at the time of the Iranian Hostage Crisis. Bringing this knowledge to the open as Argo has done was a bold, if somewhat academic, move, designed to foster some degree of understanding to a misunderstood country.While the beginning was promising, the movie quickly degenerates into a standard Hollywood political thriller. A good thriller, but one which drowns out, unfortunately, the attempt at understanding the mentality of nation which was so greatly wronged by Western powers. While the movie attempts to explain a previously unknown historical background of an important country, that message is trivialized by what is really a standard Hollywood thriller.This movie accurately depicts the atmosphere in Teheran during the overthrow of the Shah. Speaking as someone who was passing through Teheran as a tourist on the way to India, while the movie goes a long way in giving a snapshot of the city at the time, the reality was much, much worse. Teheran  was very much a city caught in the grips of great tension, apprehension and revolutionary zeal.The movies probably more accurately portrays the vagaries of life in the intelligence community. A telling portion of the movie is at the last portion of the film where Mendez (Afflect) is informed that he is about to receive the highest award in recognition of his work in the operation. Mendez informs his chief that he is not available on the date appointed for the ceremony. It really didn't matter, the chief indicates. Because Mendez did not officially participate in the operation which was highly confidential, indeed, since the operation did not officially exist, he would have to return the medal anyway. Such is the surreal world of intelligence work.Unsettling, but not surprising considering the other entrants for best picture in 2013 (Zero Dark Thirty), is the degree to which the spy agencies work hand in glove with Hollywood. The entire operation which engineered the release of the embassy workers depicted in the film was the result of the real-life participation of Hollywood producers, represented by the actors Alan Arkin and John Goodman.All things being equal, this movie conveys a better message than Zero Dark Thirty, which appears to have been scripted by the Defense Department. If the movie viewing public does not get mesmerized by the standard Hollywood shtick which is undeniably present in the film, Argo will go a long way towards creating understanding between this country and Iran.",5,"Watch and Learn, A Great Political Thriller",1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,3313,"['Argo', 'significant', 'film', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'beginning', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'action', 'narration', 'unvarnished', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'Iranian', 'history', 'last', 'sixty', 'years', 'narration', 'how', 'elected', 'government', 'Mohammed', 'Mossadegh', 'was', 'overthrown', 'American', 'British', 'interests', 'following', 'nationalization', 'Iran', 'oil', 'industry', 'narration', 'also', 'how', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'was', 'installed', 'behest', 'same', 'governments', 'how', 'Iranian', 'peoples', 'were', 'violently', 'oppressed', 'SAVAC', 'Shah', 'secret', 'police', 'people', 'Progressive', 'Community', 'knowledge', 'well', 'known', 'historically', 'undisputed', 'knowledge', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'know', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'Iran', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'known', 'American', 'citizens', 'time', 'Iranian', 'Hostage', 'Crisis', 'Bringing', 'knowledge', 'open', 'Argo', 'done', 'was', 'bold', 'somewhat', 'academic', 'move', 'designed', 'foster', 'degree', 'understanding', 'misunderstood', 'country.While', 'beginning', 'was', 'promising', 'movie', 'quickly', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'political', 'thriller', 'good', 'thriller', 'one', 'out', 'unfortunately', 'attempt', 'understanding', 'mentality', 'nation', 'was', 'so', 'greatly', 'wronged', 'Western', 'powers', 'movie', 'explain', 'previously', 'unknown', 'historical', 'background', 'important', 'country', 'message', 'trivialized', 'what', 'really', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'thriller.This', 'movie', 'accurately', 'atmosphere', 'Teheran', 'overthrow', 'Shah', 'Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'passing', 'through', 'Teheran', 'tourist', 'way', 'India', 'movie', 'long', 'way', 'giving', 'snapshot', 'city', 'time', 'reality', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'Teheran', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'city', 'caught', 'grips', 'great', 'tension', 'apprehension', 'revolutionary', 'zeal.The', 'movies', 'probably', 'more', 'accurately', 'vagaries', 'life', 'intelligence', 'community', 'telling', 'portion', 'movie', 'last', 'portion', 'film', 'where', 'Mendez', 'Afflect', 'informed', 'receive', 'highest', 'award', 'recognition', 'work', 'operation', 'Mendez', 'chief', 'not', 'available', 'date', 'appointed', 'ceremony', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'chief', 'indicates', 'Mendez', 'did', 'not', 'officially', 'participate', 'operation', 'was', 'highly', 'confidential', 'indeed', 'operation', 'did', 'not', 'officially', 'exist', 'would', 'have', 'return', 'medal', 'anyway', 'Such', 'surreal', 'world', 'intelligence', 'work.Unsettling', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'other', 'entrants', 'best', 'picture', '2013', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'degree', 'spy', 'agencies', 'work', 'hand', 'glove', 'Hollywood', 'entire', 'operation', 'engineered', 'release', 'embassy', 'workers', 'depicted', 'film', 'was', 'result', 'real-life', 'participation', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'represented', 'actors', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'John', 'Goodman.All', 'things', 'being', 'equal', 'movie', 'better', 'message', 'Zero', 'Dark', 'Thirty', 'have', 'been', 'scripted', 'Defense', 'Department', 'movie', 'viewing', 'public', 'not', 'get', 'mesmerized', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'shtick', 'undeniably', 'present', 'film', 'Argo', 'will', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'creating', 'understanding', 'country', 'Iran']",Argo

Those six people took refuge at the home of the Canadian Ambassador to Iran, Ken Taylor, where they stayed hidden, while a desperate and seemingly impossible plot was hatched within the CIA to get them out of Iran safely.Argo is that story, deftly directed by Ben Affleck, who also stars as the real-life rescuer, Tony Mendez. We have seen Affleck evolve over the years, from when he and his then-unknown screenwriting sidekick, Matt Damon, first gained a foothold in Hollywood with their screenplay for Good Will Hunting, which remains, in my opinion, Damon's best work to date. Affleck's career sputtered during various dalliances, resulting in screen work so mediocre that he won The Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor four years in a row, and deservedly so.&#8232;&#8232; But he began to regain his footing in 2010's The Company Men and The Town, and now, with Argo, he has achieved brilliant maturity, both as an actor, and also as a first-rate director.He took full command as lead actor due mostly due to his looks, referring not to his physical features alone, but also, his silent presence in several scenes in which not a word was spoken, as he &#34;looked&#34; out upon the situation and conveyed the full meaning with those &#34;looks&#34; alone &#8212; superb acting in itself. George C. Scott pulled off that same talent marvelously in one brief scene in a tent in Oklahoma Crude, and James Mason, with a simple passing glance at a cohort, summed up the full intent of why he assigned George Peppard to fly the new untried monoplane in the concluding scene of The Blue Max. It is a rare talent and the mark of a great actor. Ben Affleck now inhabits those ranks.The cast of Argo is rounded out with the Hollywood insider savvy of Alan Arkin, who takes on agent Richard Kind slap-for-slap in an insult contest, Victor Garber as the venerable Canadian ambassador, reaffirming, in my estimation, why Canada is one of the most civilized nations on Earth.-- Thomas Ormsby",5,The Work of a Matured Ben Affleck,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,2375,"['recent', 'attack', 'American', 'Consulate', 'Benghazi', 'Libya', 'gave', 'rise', 'memories', 'siege', 'embassy', 'Tehran', '1979', '444', 'day', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'ensued.', '8232', '8232', 'thrilling', 'backstory', 'siege', 'not', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'when', 'six', 'Embassy', 'staffers', 'managed', 'escape', 'streets', 'marauding', 'mob', 'was', 'able', 'fully', 'occupy', 'Embassy', 'six', 'people', 'took', 'refuge', 'home', 'Canadian', 'Ambassador', 'Iran', 'Ken', 'Taylor', 'where', 'stayed', 'hidden', 'desperate', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'plot', 'was', 'hatched', 'CIA', 'get', 'Iran', 'safely.Argo', 'story', 'deftly', 'directed', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'also', 'real-life', 'rescuer', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'have', 'seen', 'Affleck', 'evolve', 'years', 'when', 'then-unknown', 'screenwriting', 'sidekick', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'first', 'gained', 'foothold', 'Hollywood', 'screenplay', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'opinion', 'Damon', 'best', 'work', 'date', 'Affleck', 'career', 'sputtered', 'various', 'dalliances', 'resulting', 'screen', 'work', 'so', 'mediocre', 'won', 'Golden', 'Raspberry', 'Award', 'Worst', 'Actor', 'four', 'years', 'row', 'deservedly', 'so.', '8232', '8232', 'began', 'regain', 'footing', '2010', 'Company', 'Men', 'Town', 'now', 'Argo', 'achieved', 'brilliant', 'maturity', 'actor', 'also', 'first-rate', 'director.He', 'took', 'full', 'command', 'lead', 'actor', 'due', 'mostly', 'due', 'looks', 'referring', 'not', 'physical', 'features', 'alone', 'also', 'silent', 'presence', 'several', 'scenes', 'not', 'word', 'was', 'spoken', '34', 'looked', '34', 'situation', 'conveyed', 'full', 'meaning', '34', '34', 'alone', '8212', 'superb', 'acting', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'pulled', 'off', 'same', 'talent', 'marvelously', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'tent', 'Oklahoma', 'Crude', 'James', 'Mason', 'simple', 'passing', 'glance', 'cohort', 'summed', 'up', 'full', 'intent', 'why', 'assigned', 'George', 'Peppard', 'fly', 'new', 'untried', 'monoplane', 'concluding', 'scene', 'Blue', 'Max', 'rare', 'talent', 'mark', 'great', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'now', 'ranks.The', 'cast', 'Argo', 'rounded', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'insider', 'savvy', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'agent', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'slap-for-slap', 'insult', 'contest', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'venerable', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'reaffirming', 'estimation', 'why', 'Canada', 'one', 'most', 'civilized', 'nations', 'Earth.', 'Thomas', 'Ormsby']",Argo

1501748,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005S9ELM6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 1]","Six years ago, I never would've imagined I would utter ""I'm really looking forward to the new Ben Affleck film"". But after directing ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"", I found myself uttering those very words after watching the trailer for ""Argo"", his newest film. Each of these films demonstrates his skill and craftsmanship in creating films that are emotional and intensely watchable. The side benefit is that he has also acted in two of these films, turning in some of his best work as an actor as well. It almost seems as thought each is making the other side of his talents better.In 1979, just as the Iranian protesters storm the gates at the American Embassy, six American workers manage to escape and they find refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's residence. The CIA quickly learns of the escape and tries to come up with a plan to get them out of the hostile country. Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) calls in Tony Mendez (Affleck) to help them out and throw some ideas around. Tony stares at the group incredulously as someone suggests they send in bikes and maps, another suggests they pose as child aid workers and shows a picture of a starving child in Africa. Tony comes up with the idea to have them pose as a Canadian film crew scouting sights for a new sci-fi film. He gets the greenlight to go ahead and contacts John Chambers (John Goodman), a make-up artist who has helped the CIA in the past. He takes Tony to Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a producer who is trying to stay relevant in a younger Hollywood. The fake movie they will make is called ""Argo"".Based on a true story, ""Argo"" is a nifty piece of filmmaking. If someone had just come up with this idea, you probably wouldn't last ten minutes in the film because the story would seem too implausible. But because it is 'based on a true story', your interest is heightened and the incredulity of the events carries you along. This only works to a certain extent. The film has to be well-made in order for it to work for two hours. And ""Argo"" is very well-made.Affleck has accomplished a fairly remarkable feat as an actor. Considered a joke for a while, and appearing in one bomb after the other, he started to do really good work in really good films. ""Hollywoodland"" heralded the beginning of a renaissance of sorts for the actor. A few years later, he directed his first film ""Gone Baby Gone"".  It seems like he turned on a switch and suddenly became a good actor and a good director in one fell swoop. I think his ability to use his talents as a director also helped him to mature as an actor. He is now doing some of his best work as both. Sure, he still seems drawn to the big-budget Hollywood blockbuster, iffy projects that could just as easily be bad, but these seem to be the exception to the norm.In ""Argo"", Affleck's major accomplishment is that he shows restraint. The story is so far out of left field, it naturally captures your attention and Affleck tells it in a straight forward way, eschewing weird and unusual camera angles of filmmaking tricks, both of which might hamper a less-talented filmmaker's efforts. As the film draws to its suspenseful climax, he doesn't need to add any cinematic flourishes because we are already on the edge of our seats.He has assembled a fine collection of actors to bring the story to life. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are the standouts as two grizzled Hollywood veterans who wholeheartedly agree to help and make the fake film. Their characters also serve as comic relief, offering many memorable zingers about Hollywood and the people who make films for a living. They also help to keep us clued in to how ludicrous the plan is. If it works, it will be a miracle.Bryan Cranston is good as O'Donnell, the CIA official who brings Tony into the fold. If Goodman and Arkin are the comic relief, Cranston is around to provide the gravitas. When the plan experiences hiccups, he stares at the camera with a pained expression. This may sound like a rudimentary, even unnecessary addition to the film. But Cranston's performance does two things; it provides a nice counterpoint to Goodman and Arkin and helps us stay focused on the seriousness of the situation.Tate Donavan, Clea Duvall and Victor Garber play some of the people, Americans and Canadians, stuck in Iran. It is interesting to watch their characters as they deal with the always present threat of danger. Throughout the film, the narrative shifts back to them to give us a sort of update, showing us how they are dealing with the isolation of their situation. These moments also help us get to know them, which is particularly important in the final moments, as we find ourselves rooting for them, hoping they will escape to safety.Affleck's performance as Tony Gomez, the brains behind the plan to rescue these six individuals, is understated. He plays the character without a lot of emotion and there are a lot of shots of Affleck listening to and watching other things happen. This makes him our conduit to the story. And this concept works really well.Normally, we might see one of the six workers as our guide into this story, allowing us to feel what the prisoners are feeling, making us feel their pain, their imprisonment, feel everything they are experiencing. It might seem odd for Affleck's character to serve this purpose, but because he does, it seems to intensify the feelings the individual characters are experiencing. We spend some time with them, watching them deal with everything. But when Gomez arrives, there is a marked change. They feel some hope and because of this, the stakes have also gone up exponentially. This also explains why Gomez is rather stoic throughout. If he shows any emotion, the six people he is trying to save will instantly pick up on this and amplify it ten-fold causing all sorts of problems.Both Affleck the actor and Affleck the director recognize the best way to tell this incredibly gripping story is to let it unfold naturally. This is the first sign of the actor and director's maturity. So many others would try to fool around, add flourishes, dramatic touches, etc. Because he doesn't, Affleck reveals the natural drama and excitement in the story.It is a remarkably accomplished film all around.",5,Affleck's Work Just Keeps Getting Better...

1501750,A195PCNYWRB75,B005S9ELM6,tick tock,"[2, 4]","This is one of those films that gets a lot of hype and fails to live up to it. Here are a few reasons why:- Very little character development in this story. Take the embassy employees, for example. Other than sitting around and looking scared and doubting whether Affleck could pull this thing off, they did little to let me know anything about them. One scene had a guy voicing regrets about staying there too long and endangering his wife, while another had a guy with his camera turned around backwards in the marketplace. And yeah... that was about it.- Ben Affleck, while not the worst actor in the world, wore the same wooden expression throughout the movie, said or did very little of substance emotionally, and like the Embassy staff did almost nothing to make me care about him whatsoever. Other than waking up in his suit in the first scene of the film (suggesting he's a workaholic, or worse, an alcoholic), I saw little else that told us anything about his life other than the fact that he's working for the CIA and is separated from his wife and son.- Alan Arkin, a superb actor, had mediocre lines in the movie and was on camera barely ten minutes, if that. A real pity. He tried his best with what he was given, although I'm not sure it came off all that well.- The early scene of the intelligence briefing felt a little too much like The Hunt for Red October, except HFRO had better writing, not to mention better acting from Baldwin. When ""This is the best bad idea we have"" is your greatest line in a scene, you know something is wrong.- Bryan Cranston, easily the best actor sharing the screen, should have taken Affleck's role in this movie. He's so watchable, and an infinitely better performer than Affleck. Relegating him to such a small role with even smaller writing was truly painful to watch. He managed to act his way out of that corral, though, which is a testament to the man's skills when faced with mediocrity.- The historical clips, while setting a nice back-drop for the film, did not succeed in reproducing the incessant pain and suffering the country was going through at the time. I lived through the hostage crisis, felt it every night on t.v. and every day in my classroom, and experienced none of that in the film.- The so-called dramatic tension that had people ""sitting on the edge of the seats"" felt more like paint by numbers suspense. At no time did I feel uneasy or doubt a situation would resolve itself. And even though I didn't know the outcome of these specific individuals historically, I never second-guessed that plane would take off in the end.- If there was anything in this film that contributed to a feeling of mounting tension it was the recurring scene of the children putting together the shredded paper in the warehouse. That was a nice touch, even if it never really happened... so chalk one up for Hollywood, I guess.- Oh, and that bit about the housekeeper realizing that the Canadian ambassador's guests were more than they seemed... yeah, that wasn't bad, either.- And then there's the writing, if you could call it that. ""Argo F*** Yourself""? As a catch phrase? Seriously? I'm just glad that one guy who shook Affleck's hand at the end of the movie did so without saying anything at all. Better to keep your character's mouth shut and be thought a fool than open it and remove all doubt.- The fact that many of the actors compensated for bad writing by overacting didn't help much, either.- And now, the good stuff. The direction and cinematography were perhaps the only redeemable qualities of this film... so too bad it wasn't nominated in those categories.So... to sum up: 3 stars at best.And is it better than Lincoln?Hardly.Django Unchained?Not by a long shot.But when you have a film that makes Hollywood producers the stars of the film, expect it to win something.",3,"Argo, aka let's subtlely influence American opinion into bombing Iran",1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,3838,"['one', 'films', 'lot', 'hype', 'live', 'up', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'Very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'Take', 'embassy', 'employees', 'example', 'Other', 'sitting', 'looking', 'scared', 'doubting', 'Affleck', 'could', 'pull', 'thing', 'off', 'did', 'little', 'let', 'know', 'anything', 'One', 'scene', 'had', 'guy', 'voicing', 'regrets', 'staying', 'there', 'too', 'long', 'endangering', 'wife', 'had', 'guy', 'camera', 'turned', 'around', 'backwards', 'marketplace', 'yeah', 'was', 'it.-', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'not', 'worst', 'actor', 'world', 'wore', 'same', 'wooden', 'expression', 'movie', 'said', 'did', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'emotionally', 'Embassy', 'staff', 'did', 'almost', 'nothing', 'make', 'care', 'whatsoever', 'Other', 'waking', 'up', 'suit', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'suggesting', 'workaholic', 'worse', 'alcoholic', 'saw', 'little', 'else', 'told', 'anything', 'life', 'other', 'fact', 'working', 'CIA', 'separated', 'wife', 'son.-', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'superb', 'actor', 'had', 'mediocre', 'lines', 'movie', 'was', 'camera', 'barely', 'ten', 'minutes', 'real', 'pity', 'tried', 'best', 'what', 'was', 'given', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'came', 'off', 'well.-', 'early', 'scene', 'intelligence', 'briefing', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'HFRO', 'had', 'better', 'writing', 'not', 'mention', 'better', 'acting', 'Baldwin', 'When', 'best', 'bad', 'idea', 'have', 'greatest', 'line', 'scene', 'know', 'something', 'wrong.-', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'easily', 'best', 'actor', 'sharing', 'screen', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'Affleck', 'role', 'movie', 'so', 'watchable', 'infinitely', 'better', 'performer', 'Affleck', 'Relegating', 'small', 'role', 'even', 'smaller', 'writing', 'was', 'truly', 'painful', 'watch', 'managed', 'act', 'way', 'corral', 'testament', 'man', 'skills', 'when', 'faced', 'mediocrity.-', 'historical', 'clips', 'setting', 'nice', 'back-drop', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', 'reproducing', 'incessant', 'pain', 'suffering', 'country', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'lived', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'felt', 'night', 't.v', 'day', 'classroom', 'experienced', 'none', 'film.-', 'so-called', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'had', 'people', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seats', 'felt', 'more', 'paint', 'numbers', 'suspense', 'time', 'did', 'feel', 'uneasy', 'doubt', 'situation', 'would', 'resolve', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'outcome', 'specific', 'individuals', 'historically', 'never', 'second-guessed', 'plane', 'would', 'take', 'off', 'end.-', 'was', 'anything', 'film', 'contributed', 'feeling', 'mounting', 'tension', 'was', 'recurring', 'scene', 'children', 'putting', 'together', 'shredded', 'paper', 'warehouse', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'even', 'never', 'really', 'happened', 'so', 'chalk', 'one', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'guess.-', 'Oh', 'bit', 'housekeeper', 'realizing', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'guests', 'were', 'more', 'seemed', 'yeah', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either.-', 'then', 'writing', 'could', 'call', 'Argo', 'F***', 'catch', 'phrase', 'Seriously', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'shook', 'Affleck', 'hand', 'end', 'movie', 'did', 'so', 'saying', 'anything', 'Better', 'keep', 'character', 'mouth', 'shut', 'be', 'thought', 'fool', 'open', 'remove', 'doubt.-', 'fact', 'many', 'actors', 'compensated', 'bad', 'writing', 'overacting', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'either.-', 'now', 'good', 'stuff', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'were', 'perhaps', 'only', 'redeemable', 'qualities', 'film', 'so', 'too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'categories.So', 'sum', 'up', '3', 'stars', 'best.And', 'better', 'Lincoln', 'Hardly.Django', 'Unchained', 'Not', 'long', 'shot.But', 'when', 'have', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'stars', 'film', 'expect', 'win', 'something']",Argo

As a top-of-the-line, bona fide, USDA Certified, Grade A STUD storyboard artist myself, it was nice to see that we have the power to pre-visualize productions AND save lives in the process.  That's a what an artist at the pinnacle of his/her profession can do.It was just disappointing that the Hollywood Hotshots who made this film didn't contact me for the actual boards because I have been involved with some of the greatest ad campaigns and feature films that have graced your VISIO flatscreen and the big screens at the cineplex picture show.  Perhaps you've heard of the Dell kid who always ended the commercials with 'Dude, you're getting a Dell' (prior to his arrest and banishment from the industry after marijuana possession, anyway)?  Maybe you've seen some Cialis commercials where the older couples end up knockin' the boots and end up in separate bathtubs in a exotic location?  'Corky Romano', anybody?  All blockbusters and all pretty much successful due to me.Let's just say the Producers  (Benjamin Afflent, George Cooney and that squirly sidekick to Schwarzenegger and Thomas Arnold in 'True Lies') dropped the ball by not hiring me.Anywho, I think the getaway sequence in this film ruined it overall for me.  Even if it is the early 1980's, instead of running through an entire airport, there are communication devices called telephones where one party can contact another party to overt, I don't know, a plane from taking off.  I mean, just call the air traffic control tower and ground Swiss Air from taking off as opposed to running miles and miles, breaking locked doors and ripping through fences to get down to jetway.  I was surprised the Iranians even used cars to chase after the 747 as it began to taxi because they are depicted as such incompetents that you would think they would chase after them on camels.I liked that Marissa's dad from 'The OC' was in it.

While the majority of the State Department is focused on those hostages, six members of the embassy staff have sought refuge with the Canadian ambassador. How would you get them out? Could you get them out?Thanks to the U.S. allowing their deposed leader to seek refuge in America, the Iranian people storm the American embassy on November 4, 1979. The staff is rushing to shred or burn all their confidential files. The majority of the staff are held hostage while a small percentage escape unnoticed. The State Department begins planning a rescue and asks the CIA to consult. It's abundantly clear to the Agency's ""exfiltration"" specialist, Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck), that the State Department is in over their heads. With such plans as having the embassy workers ride to the border disguised as teachers on bicycles in winter. It was back in his hotel watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and talking to the son Ian (played by Aidan Sussman) that Tony (Affleck) has an idea. Disguise the hostages as a film crew and sneak them out right under the enemy's nose. After bringing the idea to his boss, Jack O'Donnell (played by Bryan Cranston) the plan gets the go-ahead. Later, they approach the make-up specialist who worked on The Planet of the Apes who has also done work for the Agency in the past, John Chambers (played by John Goodman). Chambers in turn introduces Mendez to a well-known producer named Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin). Once they've chosen a script, Argo, a science-fiction fantasy in the style of Star Wars, they go the extra mile in establishing it as a legitimate enterprise. Where it was simply a poster in the beginning, Siegel organizes a table-reading with known actors, press, and studio staff. While all this is going on, the Iranian government has sweatshop labor assembling the shredded photos so that they can identify anyone who they failed to capture. Also, our six escapees become increasingly fearful that they will be discovered.I'm kind of a sucker for movies based on factual events, no matter how much the narrative diverges from history. A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, some that don't have Russell Crowe as the lead actor. That said, it doesn't guarantee I will like it. Case in point, I found J. Edgar unbelievably dissatisfying. Argo, on the other hand, is brilliant, in my opinion. The story is gripping, the comic relief is hilarious, and the suspense has me on the edge of my seat.

A thriller ""Argo,"" based on true events recorded in recently declassified CIA documents, is one such example. And Hollywood chose a right person to direct it: Ben Affleck, who, after ""The Town"" and ""Gone Baby Gone,"" once again shows his talent as an accomplished film director.On January 25, 1980, a CIA ""extractor"" Tony Mendez traveled to Iran, where about two month before a group of young Islamists invaded the US embassy in Tehran. During the confusion six embassy workers managed to escape the building without being seen by the revolutionary guards, and they took refuge in the private house of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor, who was well aware of the great risk he was running.Tony Mendez's mission was unique, something that was never done before. Mendez poses as a Canadian producer scouting exotic location for a Hollywood sci-fi film ""Argo"" - a film project that does not exist. And he disguises the trapped American embassy workers as Canadian film crew members so that they can get out of Iran safely. This is his ""best bad idea"" - but will that ""bad idea"" really work?Set in the middle of the Iranian Revolution (of which background is briefly shown in the opening), ""Argo"" is a tense and fast-paced thriller that never lets up.

1501775,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005S9ELM6,Turfseer,"[19, 29]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I enjoyed 'Argo', but some people are talking this flick up as an Oscar winner for best picture. That I cannot see. However, it is definitely a story worth telling as it's a fascinating tale and reminds Americans about the dangers of a country like Iran.Perhaps the most gripping part of the film is the opening, as the US embassy is about to be taken over by fanatical 'students' and supporters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who just returned to Iran as a result of the 1979 revolution. Ben Affleck does a great job in chronicling how US embassy staff members went about shredding classified documents, minutes before the embassy compound is taken over by the fanatics. Equally fascinating is the way in which the six US staff members make their escape, as they simply walk out on to the street from an adjoining building, while the crazed Iranians are focusing on attacking the main part of the compound.When I first heard about 'Argo', I thought the whole operation was much more extensive, involving a whole film crew entering Iran and actually beginning to film a phony movie there. It wasn't quite that complicated. CIA operative Tony Mendez's plan was simply to create the illusion that a movie was going to be made in Hollywood, by taking out an ad in a trade paper and holding a 'table read' of the script, which was covered by the press. Interestingly enough, the producer played by Alan Arkin is a fictional construct; only John Goodman's character, John Chambers, the Hollywood make-up artist, actually existed.As the Argo story develops, with Mendez flying to Iran posing as a Canadian film producer and establishing contact with the Iranian film board, it all seemed quite plausible. And when Mendez takes the six members to a bazaar in the city, where their cover is almost blown when confronted by an angry crowd, that also seemed quite real. But when we finally arrive at the crucial scene, where the six must get past an Iranian ticket taker at the airport, without any proof that they actually came into the country, I wondered if that happened the way it's depicted in the film. It turns out that in reality, the Canadian ambassador's wife purchased three separate sets of tickets on three different airlines for the six embassy staff members.Even more historically inaccurate is the suspenseful scene in the film, in which the Carter administration cancels the mission just as Mendez is about to attempt to whisk his charges out of Iran. In reality, the mission was canceled for only thirty minutes and that occurred BEFORE Mendez left the United States.Finally, perhaps the most suspenseful part of the film, the confrontation with the Revolutionary guards at the departure gate, the call to Hollywood to confirm Mendez's cover and big chase out on the runway--none of that ever happened. Even without prior knowledge of the true history of the events depicted here, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the chase on the runway was pure Hollywood.Does Affleck's 'dramatic license', diminish the film's overall impact? Frankly, yes. Too much of what goes on, seems a bit far-fetched. Nonetheless, 'Argo' is still quite entertaining and is worth the price of admission. More credit should have gone to the Canadian ambassador Taylor, in his role in saving the US embassy staff members (the closing credits merely allude to the great co-operation between the US and Canada and say nothing specifically of Taylor's heroics).Finally, I was most impressed by the casting choices for the six embassy staff members. The ID cards of the actual escapees are shown during the closing credits, juxtaposed with the actors playing them. Take a look at the resemblance between the real and the fictional characters. It's uncanny!",3,Affleck employs dramatic license to make CIA Iranian rescue operation more suspenseful than it actually was,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,3795,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***I', 'enjoyed', ""'Argo"", 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'flick', 'up', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'best', 'picture', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'However', 'definitely', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'fascinating', 'tale', 'reminds', 'Americans', 'dangers', 'country', 'Iran.Perhaps', 'most', 'gripping', 'part', 'film', 'opening', 'US', 'embassy', 'be', 'taken', 'over', 'fanatical', ""'students"", 'supporters', 'Ayatollah', 'Khomeini', 'who', 'just', 'returned', 'Iran', 'result', '1979', 'revolution', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'great', 'job', 'chronicling', 'how', 'US', 'embassy', 'staff', 'members', 'went', 'shredding', 'classified', 'documents', 'minutes', 'embassy', 'compound', 'taken', 'over', 'fanatics', 'Equally', 'fascinating', 'way', 'six', 'US', 'staff', 'members', 'make', 'escape', 'simply', 'walk', 'out', 'street', 'adjoining', 'building', 'crazed', 'Iranians', 'are', 'focusing', 'attacking', 'main', 'part', 'compound.When', 'first', 'heard', ""'Argo"", 'thought', 'whole', 'operation', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'extensive', 'involving', 'whole', 'film', 'crew', 'entering', 'Iran', 'actually', 'beginning', 'film', 'phony', 'movie', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'complicated', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'plan', 'was', 'simply', 'create', 'illusion', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'taking', 'out', 'ad', 'trade', 'paper', 'holding', ""'table"", 'read', 'script', 'was', 'covered', 'press', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'producer', 'played', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'fictional', 'construct', 'only', 'John', 'Goodman', 'character', 'John', 'Chambers', 'Hollywood', 'make-up', 'artist', 'actually', 'Argo', 'story', 'develops', 'Mendez', 'flying', 'Iran', 'posing', 'Canadian', 'film', 'producer', 'establishing', 'contact', 'Iranian', 'film', 'board', 'seemed', 'quite', 'plausible', 'when', 'Mendez', 'six', 'members', 'bazaar', 'city', 'where', 'cover', 'almost', 'blown', 'when', 'confronted', 'angry', 'crowd', 'also', 'seemed', 'quite', 'real', 'when', 'finally', 'arrive', 'crucial', 'scene', 'where', 'six', 'must', 'get', 'Iranian', 'ticket', 'taker', 'airport', 'proof', 'actually', 'came', 'country', 'wondered', 'happened', 'way', 'depicted', 'film', 'out', 'reality', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'wife', 'purchased', 'three', 'separate', 'sets', 'tickets', 'three', 'different', 'airlines', 'six', 'embassy', 'staff', 'members.Even', 'more', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'suspenseful', 'scene', 'film', 'Carter', 'administration', 'mission', 'just', 'Mendez', 'attempt', 'whisk', 'charges', 'Iran', 'reality', 'mission', 'was', 'canceled', 'only', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'occurred', 'BEFORE', 'Mendez', 'left', 'United', 'States.Finally', 'perhaps', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'part', 'film', 'confrontation', 'Revolutionary', 'guards', 'departure', 'gate', 'call', 'Hollywood', 'confirm', 'Mendez', 'cover', 'big', 'chase', 'runway', 'none', 'ever', 'happened', 'Even', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'true', 'history', 'events', 'depicted', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'figure', 'out', 'chase', 'runway', 'was', 'pure', 'Hollywood.Does', 'Affleck', ""'dramatic"", 'license', 'diminish', 'film', 'overall', 'impact', 'Frankly', 'yes', 'Too', 'much', 'what', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'Nonetheless', ""'Argo"", 'still', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'price', 'admission', 'More', 'credit', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'Canadian', 'ambassador', 'Taylor', 'role', 'saving', 'US', 'embassy', 'staff', 'members', 'closing', 'credits', 'merely', 'allude', 'great', 'co-operation', 'US', 'Canada', 'say', 'nothing', 'specifically', 'Taylor', 'heroics', '.Finally', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'casting', 'choices', 'six', 'embassy', 'staff', 'members', 'ID', 'cards', 'actual', 'escapees', 'are', 'shown', 'closing', 'credits', 'juxtaposed', 'actors', 'playing', 'Take', 'look', 'resemblance', 'real', 'fictional', 'characters', 'uncanny']",Argo

A CIA agent (Ben Affleck who also directed) proposes the absurd--he will go in pretending to be a film producer for a science fiction movie and the group will leave the country as part of his film team.Those bothered by historical inaccuracies in a dramatic film BASED on real events may dislike the fact that 1) the sequence in the bazaar never happened (it does add nicely to the suspense and Affleck admits as such in his commentary track), the entire conclusion in the airport never happened (again, Affleck in the director's commentary admits he was trying to increase the suspense)and that the Canadians aren't recognized enough for their efforts in assisting the Americans to escape (Affleck added a postscript recognizing them but admits in the commentary track that he had to simplify the plotline a bit to make it work within the proscripted time limit for the film).If you can look at this as a dramatic event based on a real one and accept that it doesn't adhere to history 100%, you will enjoy the film.END OF SPOILERS:&#34;Argo&#34; is, in many respects, a throwback to earlier style thrillers. Affleck chose to eschew the ADD rapid cutting and shakey cam of contemporary thrillers echoing the style of a thriller from the time the film is set in.The grainy and somewhat harsh look of the film is intentional--Affleck deliberately mimicked the look of late 70's/early 80's thrillers right down to the lighting of the film. Detail is exceptionally good and there aren't any noticeable digital artifacts in the presentation. Colors are rock solid throughout. &#34;Argo&#34; receives a sharp, detailed and strong presentation on Blu-ray.The audio is exceptional as well with an active 5.1 mix although keep in mind that much of the film is dialogue driven.The special features are quite nice as well with a commentary track from star/director Affleck and writer Chris Terrio that provides us with quite a bit of detail on the shoot as well as some changes that occurred during the scripting vs. shooting of the film.We also get a picture-in-picture option that allows you to watch interviews with those who lived through the incident discuss as we're watching the action. It's a terrific special feature.We also get a very good featurette featuring the people who lived through the events portrayed in &#34;Argo&#34; including former President Jimmy Carter.&#34;Absolute Authenticy&#34; focuses on how detailed the production was at recreating the look of the time.&#34;Escape from Iran-The Hollywood Option&#34; is the only special feature presented in standard definition running about 48 minutes. It features plenty of interviews and vintage footage that contrasts nicely with the ficitional account.Although the film has been criticized for its lack of fidelity to the facts, the fictionalized version of what occurred in 1979 is a terrific thriller that nicely recaptures the feel of the time.Recommended.",4,Enjoyable thriller,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,3281,"['play', 'bit', 'loose', 'fast', 'facts', '34', 'Argo', '34', 'entertaining', 'drama', 'real', 'event', 'occurred', '1980.SPOILERS', 'Set', '1980', 'five', 'members', 'U.S.', 'Embassy', 'are', 'trapped', 'post-revolution', 'Iran', 'hiding', 'Canadian', 'Embassy', 'Canadian', 'government', 'CIA', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'plan', 'retrieve', 'safety', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'absurd', 'will', 'go', 'pretending', 'be', 'film', 'producer', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'group', 'will', 'leave', 'country', 'part', 'film', 'team.Those', 'bothered', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'dramatic', 'film', 'BASED', 'real', 'events', 'may', 'dislike', 'fact', '1', 'sequence', 'bazaar', 'never', 'happened', 'add', 'nicely', 'suspense', 'Affleck', 'such', 'commentary', 'track', 'entire', 'conclusion', 'airport', 'never', 'happened', 'again', 'Affleck', 'director', 'commentary', 'admits', 'was', 'trying', 'increase', 'suspense', 'Canadians', 'are', ""n't"", 'recognized', 'enough', 'efforts', 'assisting', 'Americans', 'escape', 'Affleck', 'added', 'postscript', 'recognizing', 'commentary', 'track', 'had', 'simplify', 'plotline', 'bit', 'make', 'work', 'proscripted', 'time', 'limit', 'film', 'can', 'look', 'dramatic', 'event', 'based', 'real', 'one', 'accept', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'history', '100', '%', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film.END', 'SPOILERS', '34', 'Argo', '34', 'many', 'respects', 'throwback', 'earlier', 'style', 'thrillers', 'Affleck', 'chose', 'eschew', 'ADD', 'rapid', 'cutting', 'shakey', 'cam', 'contemporary', 'thrillers', 'echoing', 'style', 'thriller', 'time', 'film', 'set', 'in.The', 'grainy', 'somewhat', 'harsh', 'look', 'film', 'intentional', 'Affleck', 'deliberately', 'mimicked', 'look', 'late', ""70's/early"", '80', 'thrillers', 'right', 'down', 'lighting', 'film', 'Detail', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'are', ""n't"", 'noticeable', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'presentation', 'Colors', 'are', 'rock', 'solid', '34', 'Argo', '34', 'sharp', 'detailed', 'strong', 'presentation', 'Blu-ray.The', 'audio', 'exceptional', 'well', 'active', '5.1', 'mix', 'keep', 'mind', 'much', 'film', 'dialogue', 'driven.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'track', 'star/director', 'Affleck', 'writer', 'Chris', 'Terrio', 'bit', 'detail', 'shoot', 'as', 'well', 'changes', 'occurred', 'scripting', 'shooting', 'film.We', 'also', 'get', 'picture-in-picture', 'option', 'watch', 'interviews', 'who', 'lived', 'incident', 'discuss', ""'re"", 'watching', 'action', 'terrific', 'special', 'feature.We', 'also', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'featurette', 'featuring', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'events', 'portrayed', '34', 'Argo', '34', 'including', 'former', 'President', 'Jimmy', 'Carter.', '34', 'Absolute', 'Authenticy', '34', 'focuses', 'how', 'detailed', 'production', 'was', 'recreating', 'look', 'time.', '34', 'Escape', 'Iran-The', 'Hollywood', 'Option', '34', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'presented', 'standard', 'definition', 'running', 'about', '48', 'minutes', 'plenty', 'interviews', 'vintage', 'footage', 'nicely', 'ficitional', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'lack', 'fidelity', 'facts', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'what', 'occurred', '1979', 'terrific', 'thriller', 'nicely', 'feel', 'time.Recommended']",Argo

1501797,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B005S9ELM6,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[3, 7]","It's not unusual for actors at some point to try their hand at directing. It is unusual though if they turn out to be good at it, and it's even more unusual when it turns out that they're consistently good at it. Argo is Ben Affleck's third turn at directing a feature film, and after 2007's Gone Baby Gone and 2010's The Town, I have to say that Affleck seems to really know what he's doing.Argo is a well-paced and tense rescue thriller drawn from a now largely forgotten episode of the 1980 Iranian Hostage Crisis. Everyone still remembers that shortly after the Iranian Revolution, 52 Americans were taken hostage when a mob of students and militants took over the US embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979 and were held for 444 days, not being released until January 20th, 1981. What many have forgotten though is that six embassy staffers managed to slip out of the embassy before it was overrun and were able to take refuge at the home of the Canadian ambassador, where they ended up staying hidden for 85 days until an elaborate ruse by the CIA and the Canadian government allowed them to sneak out of the country even as the Iranian authorities were closing in on them. With a screenplay written by Chris Terrio based on a 2007 Wired article by Joshuah Bearman called ""How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran"", Argo now tells that story.The film begins with the US embassy in Tehran surrounded by a mob of angry Iranians. When the mob begins crawling over the fence and entering the embassy compound, six Americans decide to slip outside of the embassy through a back entrance that wasn't on the main street where the mob had gathered. They end up taking refuge in the house of the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). When the US government learns of their situation, they start trying to figure out a way to get them out of the country before they're found. To this end, they bring in one of their ""ex-filtration"" specialists, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), who immediately shoots down the tentative plans they've come up with but doesn't have anything better to offer. At least not until, while talking to his young son on the phone, he tunes into a showing of Battle for the Planet of the Apes that his son is watching. The film gives him an idea: create a fake story about a sci-fi movie that supposedly will be shot in Iran by a Canadian production company, and then, using fake credentials, pass off the six Americans as a Canadian film crew for that movie, in Iran scouting locations, and then fly them out of the country once their scouting work is done. Even with the backing of his immediate boss, Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), the higher-ups at the CIA are dubious that the plan can work. But they give in when Mendez and O'Donnell point out that all of their plans are bad and that the fake film project ""is the best bad plan we've got.""  The movie title - Argo - comes from the name of the screenplay Mendez eventually picks as the basis for their fake film project.  For as John Chambers (John Goodman) tells him once he undertakes the project, ""Even a fake movie has to have a real screenplay behind it.""The cast are excellent. John Goodman does a nice turn as John Chambers, the affable Hollywood special-effects make-up artist Mendez turns to for help in creating the fake movie-buzz. Alan Arkin is perfectly cast as Lester Siegel, the veteran producer (a composite character) Mendez and Chambers recruit to help give the fake movie life, stealing every scene he's in with some of the best lines in the film (""If I'm going to make a fake movie, it's going to be a fake hit!"")  Bryan Cranston's Jack O'Donnell is the kind of boss we all wish we had, going to the mat and breaking every rule of bureaucracy and protocol in highly creative ways when Mendez unexpectedly changes the plan at the last minute.  And Affleck himself is brilliant as Tony Mendez, showing a man who's methodical and committed and above all, superbly self-controlled under pressure, but without descending into a cliched action-hero. Affleck's Mendez feels the same strains and tensions everyone around him is feeling and experiences the same doubts - he just never lets it get the better of him. Or distract him from what needs to be done. And last but far from least, Scoot McNairy delivers a stand-out performance as hostage Joe Stafford, who goes from being the one most doubtful of and uncooperative with Mendez's plan to, in a critical moment, stepping up unexpectedly and playing his role as the crew's executive producer to the hilt, convincing the Revolutionary Guards at the airport not only that their film project is absolutely real, but that the story is about a revolt of downtrodden subjects, led by a wise man, who rise up to overthrow a tyrannical alien overlord, deftly turning the B-grade sci-fi plot into an allegory for the Iranian revolution.  What could easily have been a clich&eacute;d role, McNairy made into something that feels totally authentic, whether it's when he's expressing Stafford's fears and doubts in a plan that would sound dubious even to an optimist, or when he's playing a man improvising like hell in a critical moment, knowing that if he fails he and his friends could all be killed but channeling that fear into unrelenting determination to sell the idea with absolute committed sincerity.  A Best Supporting Actor nomination for McNairy would not surprise me in the least.Affleck as director does a terrific job of re-creating those tense days, particularly of the situation in Tehran itself where conditions border on anarchy and people are being summarily executed in the streets for anything from being suspected of pro-Shah loyalties to the simple settling of old scores. The tension is palpable from the beginning and Affleck deftly keeps turning it up, making you feel the very real sense of threat that the six Americans are feeling as the passing weeks of hiding in near constant fear take their toll on them. Importantly though, he also shows that it was ordinary Iranians themselves who suffered the most from the chaos and convulsions of the revolution. For all of the harshness of their months in captivity, all of the American hostages made it out alive. A lot of ordinary Iranians didn't.In addition, Affleck also shows enormous attention to detail, layering the film with inserted bits of period footage and music, filling in the background in which the hostage crisis took place:  the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 1980 Carter/Reagan Presidential contest, the boycotting by the US of the 1980 Olympics and so on.  And in recreated scenes, he used a special technique of shooting on regular film, then cutting half of the frames and blowing the remainder up by 200 percent to increase the graininess of the footage so simulate the feel of actual news footage of the period.As with any film based on historical events, there are certain differences between what you see in Argo and what actually happened.  Some were artistically necessary to keep the tension sustained all the way up to the point that the hostages actually left Iranian air space.  Others were made to keep the focus on the core characters and to make the plot narrative easier.  For example, the six hostages were actually hiding out in two Canadian residences and not one, but it was easier to write the screenplay with all of the hostage characters in one residence.  The only important difference that I feel should be pointed out is that the film downplays the role of the Canadians, both in terms of the actions of the Canadian diplomatic staff in Iran and in the extent to which the Canadian government was actively involved in the rescue planning.  The Canadian parliament actually had its first secret session since WWII to grant the six hostages real Canadian passports to make sure that their authenticity would pass any examination.  But all in all, Affleck does a commendable job of making a good edgy thriller without distorting the story beyond any real connection with actual events.On a side note, the real-life John Chambers was quite a fascinating individual. Few people will recognize the name but many have seen his handiwork. Best known for doing the special-effects make-up in the Planet of the Apes films (for which he won a special Academy Award), Chambers also was the man who came up with Spock's Vulcan ears in the original Star Trek TV series, and worked on TV shows from The Munsters and The Outer Limits to The Night Gallery and Lost In Space and numerous others. Chambers got his start in the Army during and after World War II, where as a medical technician he became involved in reconstructive surgery, creating new ears, noses, and chins, as well as teeth, for wounded veterans. He also got experience in creating prosthetic limbs. This background led to his getting a a job in makeup for NBC in 1953. In addition to his regular work, Chambers also used his expertise and contacts to help indigent cancer victims acquire prosthetics and reconstructive work they couldn't afford. For his work in films and television, he was awarded an Emmy and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And for his behind-the-scenes work for the CIA over the years, he was awarded their highest civilian honor, which is mentioned in the epilogue at the end of the film where they show picture of the characters in the film alongside one of the real-life people they portrayed. A really remarkable man worthy of a bio-film of his own.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a well-crafted film with engaging performances that keeps the tension mounting and for anyone interested in an interesting bit of actual history.",5,Deftly-directed rescue thriller drawn from a forgotten episode of the 1980 Iranian Hostage Crisis,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,9706,"['not',

Modern eyes need to see what that means, and this shows it.Even the acting is subdued - the first two thirds combine documentary, bureaucratic procedural, and claustrophobia. The historical facts and the escap have drama of their own, especially for those of us who remember the events, at least as the media could show them. Lots of scene-setting and character-building. You know, the slow stuff. The drama builds, though, as tempers fray and the gears of the hierarchy slowly grind.Then, the exfiltration (i.e., escape) specialist arrives on scene. From that point, the movie really begins. Tensions rise with the political pressure. Then, the clock becomes a worse enemy than the revolutionaries. The refuge closes, the cover story demands too much exposure, events move faster than the rescuer. This sustains a ""down to the last second"" breathlessness better than anything I've seen. Think about those Bond movies with the bomb ticking 5..4..3..2..1..... - like that, but with international intrigue on each side of the timer. Tension sustains down to the very last moment, which you'll see for yourself.And, behind it all, there's a very real piece of recent history. This escape really happened, and in roughly the way the movie shows. (I imagine some artistic license, but it doesn't seem too licentious.) That reality, with everyone a bullet away from death, gives an edge of reality that normal scripting can never achieve. Then, in the trailers, they show the real diplomats side by side with the actors representing them - the matching is just amazing.This movie needs to be seen. It brings plain old acting and drama back to the screen, and brilliantly. I don't say this often, but I could see this one again, soon.

For whatever reason, I always saw him as the ""second fiddle"" to Matt Damon after ""Good Will Hunting"" and didn't give him much respect as either an actor or a filmmaker.  With ""Argo"", however, I got a nice helping of crow, as Affleck proves to be more than a capable director, and in fact turns in an incredible effort.For a basic plot summary, ""Argo"" deals the the Iran Hostage Crisis of the President Jimmy Carter administration.  When all other ideas to extract the U.S. hostages being harbored by the Canadian Embassy in Iran fail, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) concocts the craziest idea yet: posing as a fake Hollywood production in order to get inside Iran and smuggle out the Americans.The main reason this film works so well is because the direction from Affleck is superb.  The movie contains action, tension, drama, and even some humor, all the while staying focused and ""tight"" (never losing track of the overall narrative).  From the opening scene until the closing credits, the viewer is sucked into this story and never feels bored or let down.The film also works as a bit of a history lesson regarding the United States and its relations with other Middle Eastern countries (Iran especially, obviously).  Since those hostilities still exist to this day, the story of ""Argo"" does not feel old or outdated in any sense.Also, Affleck is given a fine supporting cast to work with, including such talent as Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman, to name a few.  Each of the cast members add a little bit of their distinctive talents to the overall production.Thus, ""Argo"" is an extraordinary film for its ability to re-create the tension of the Iran Hostage Crisis.  I never thought I would ever say this, but if I were voting in the 2013 Academy Awards, I would give the ""Best Director"" nod to Affleck over Steven Spielberg.",5,Affleck Takes A Big Step Forward,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1901,"['years', 'have', 'given', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'lot', 'crap', 'reason', 'always', 'saw', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'respect', 'actor', 'filmmaker', 'Argo', 'however', 'got', 'nice', 'helping', 'crow', 'Affleck', 'be', 'more', 'capable', 'director', 'fact', 'turns', 'incredible', 'effort.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Argo', 'Iran', 'Hostage', 'Crisis', 'President', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'administration', 'When', 'other', 'ideas', 'extract', 'U.S.', 'hostages', 'being', 'harbored', 'Canadian', 'Embassy', 'Iran', 'fail', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Tony', 'Mendez', 'Affleck', 'craziest', 'idea', 'yet', 'posing', 'fake', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'order', 'get', 'inside', 'Iran', 'smuggle', 'out', 'Americans.The', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'direction', 'Affleck', 'superb', 'movie', 'action', 'tension', 'drama', 'even', 'humor', 'while', 'staying', 'focused', 'tight', 'never', 'losing', 'track', 'overall', 'narrative', 'opening', 'scene', 'closing', 'credits', 'viewer', 'sucked', 'story', 'never', 'feels', 'bored', 'let', 'down.The', 'film', 'also', 'bit', 'history', 'lesson', 'regarding', 'United', 'States', 'relations', 'other', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'countries', 'Iran', 'especially', 'obviously', 'hostilities', 'still', 'exist', 'day', 'story', 'Argo', 'not', 'feel', 'old', 'outdated', 'sense.Also', 'Affleck', 'given', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'work', 'including', 'such', 'talent', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'John', 'Goodman', 'name', 'few', 'cast', 'members', 'add', 'little', 'bit', 'distinctive', 'talents', 'overall', 'production.Thus', 'Argo', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'ability', 're-create', 'tension', 'Iran', 'Hostage', 'Crisis', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'say', 'were', 'voting', '2013', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'would', 'give', 'Best', 'Director', 'nod', 'Affleck', 'Steven', 'Spielberg']",Argo

When Ben claimed, in a recent interview, that the reason the Canadians integral role (90% Canada/ 10% USA - according to president Jimmy Carter and those actually involved) in freeing the hostages was not represented truthfully, he brushed it off quickly by commenting that ""there was not enough time to fit it all in"".In other words, for Ben, making the Americans ""centre of the universe"" even under the guise of docudrama, trumps truth. The reality is that the small role the CIA did actually play, had the real potential of getting the hostages killed on their way out of Iran. Historically (pun intended) the CIA espionage folk put a wrong date on the passport stamp - which if not detected, and altered (again by a Canadian) would have meant instant detection, and potentially certain death on their way out of the airport - not to mention what would have happened to the Canadian embassy personnel.Dramatic license must be extended to any historical account for time constraints or the inevitable lapse in research, however, when the focus is to distort and or pervert the truth, everyone involved suffers.Ben in recent award shows, still attempts to use his youthful ignorance and surprised-face to pass off this travesty of history. I don't buy that, or the movie - nor should anyone interested in the truth. Historical accuracy can be every bit as dramatic and entertaining as BS with the added bonus of attracting a wider audience and staying on the charts for many more years.No doubt, all those, who have or will receive monetary gain from this schlock will rally to its defense, somehow. There is no defense, however, for the damage inflicted on the historical record, those who buy into that distortion, or the Canadians, and the lives of six US hostages whose lives depended on real intervention by real people.Ziek / bamfrmcan",3,Ben's Argo and Lance's Medals,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,2189,"['What', 'do', 'have', 'common', 'generated', 'great', 'gobs', 'money', 'represent', 'dramatic', 'distortion', 'truth', 'take', 'significant', 'chunk', 'American', 'credibility.It', 'bad', 'enough', 'majority', 'America', 'education', '17th', 'lower', 'world', 'ranking', 'movies', 'Argo', 'case', 'based', 'declassified', 'true', 'story', 'When', 'Ben', 'claimed', 'recent', 'interview', 'reason', 'Canadians', 'integral', 'role', '90', '%', 'Canada/', '10', '%', 'USA', 'according', 'president', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'actually', 'involved', 'freeing', 'hostages', 'was', 'not', 'represented', 'truthfully', 'brushed', 'off', 'quickly', 'commenting', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'fit', '.In', 'other', 'words', 'Ben', 'making', 'Americans', 'centre', 'universe', 'even', 'guise', 'docudrama', 'trumps', 'truth', 'reality', 'small', 'role', 'CIA', 'did', 'actually', 'play', 'had', 'real', 'potential', 'getting', 'hostages', 'killed', 'way', 'Iran', 'Historically', 'pun', 'intended', 'CIA', 'espionage', 'folk', 'put', 'wrong', 'date', 'passport', 'stamp', 'not', 'detected', 'altered', 'again', 'Canadian', 'would', 'have', 'meant', 'instant', 'detection', 'potentially', 'certain', 'death', 'way', 'airport', 'not', 'mention', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Canadian', 'embassy', 'personnel.Dramatic', 'license', 'must', 'be', 'extended', 'historical', 'account', 'time', 'constraints', 'inevitable', 'lapse', 'research', 'however', 'when', 'focus', 'distort', 'pervert', 'truth', 'everyone', 'involved', 'suffers.Ben', 'recent', 'award', 'shows', 'still', 'use', 'youthful', 'ignorance', 'surprised-face', 'pass', 'off', 'travesty', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'should', 'anyone', 'interested', 'truth', 'Historical', 'accuracy', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'dramatic', 'entertaining', 'BS', 'added', 'bonus', 'attracting', 'wider', 'audience', 'staying', 'charts', 'many', 'more', 'years.No', 'doubt', 'who', 'have', 'will', 'receive', 'monetary', 'gain', 'schlock', 'will', 'rally', 'defense', 'somehow', 'defense', 'however', 'damage', 'inflicted', 'historical', 'record', 'who', 'buy', 'distortion', 'Canadians', 'lives', 'six', 'US', 'hostages', 'lives', 'depended', 'real', 'intervention', 'real', 'people.Ziek', '/', 'bamfrmcan']",Argo
