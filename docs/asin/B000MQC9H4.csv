1049006,A3GI6DS6I474K8,B000MQC9H4,"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author""","[124, 143]","Two women. Two failed relationships. Two houses. One great romantic comedy. The Holiday is the story of two women, Iris (Kate Winslet in a poignant performance) and Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who swap houses for two weeks thinking it will help them get over their relationship problems. Amanda will take Iris's house in a small cottage just outside of London, and Iris will stay at Amanda's house in L.A. They will both meet someone who will help them mend their heart.Let's get one thing out of the way: Yes, this is a chick flick, but a damn fine one at that! I'm not much of a fan of the genre, nor of Nancy Meyers' films, but when I saw this in theatres with my girlfriend last December, I loved it. I thought the film would've lost some of its charm on second viewing, but it hasn't lost one bit of it. With a running time of 136 minutes, you'd think it would drag but it feels like a 90-minute film.The film has a few surprises and most of all, a great subplot around Arthur's (screen veteran Eli Wallach in a brilliant performance) character. The film goes back and forth between the two relationships, the one in the UK and the one in the US, which gives it a great rhythm. Nothing seems forced and it doesn't fall into the typical clich&eacute;s of the genre. The dialogue is very well written, kudos to Meyers for that. The characters are interesting; Winslet (my favorite actress) shines in her role as Iris, the girl who falls for the wrong man. I usually avoid movies starring Cameron Diaz and/or Jack Black like the plague, but they were both really good in that one. Jude Law brought some class to his role. The supporting cast was very good (keep your eyes open for a cameo by a famous actor in the video store).Overall, The Holiday is a very enjoyable film and you don't have to love romantic comedies to enjoy it. It's closer to Something's Gotta Give than What Women Want, and it's much better this way.

1049007,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000MQC9H4,Alistair McHarg,"[8, 11]","Movie making and politics have grown remarkably similar.  In both cases, products are packaged not on merit - much less vision - but on marketability.  Candidates don't bravely craft innovative platforms and then sell their merits to the public, they simply figure out what the public wants to hear and then devise catchy ways of saying it.  Likewise, many filmmakers avoid artistic risk and creativity, settling instead for products that will sell.  Nancy Meyers, who wrote and directed The Holiday, has clearly targeted women as her market, particularly women who are drawn to frothy, weepy, dim-witted romanticism and sentimentality.  In What Women Want, she actually hit some high notes.  In The Holiday, poor writing, a clich&eacute; fiesta, plot predictability, and ham-fisted direction combine to make a vacation from reality certain to have you craving home.Among the film's innumerable flaws is the high percentage of ""movie jobs,"" - not to be confused with real jobs that real people pursue.  Everyone has pots of money and works as a journalist, book editor, popular writer, movie trailer editor, movie score composer, hot air balloonist, or itinerant Marcel Marceau impersonator.  Amanda, Cameron Diaz, lives in a house so ostentatious it would embarrass Pablo Escobar.  Those looking for a shred of reality should look elsewhere.  The premise - swapping houses and lives with an absolute stranger - is equally far-fetched.  Though it is an actual practice, it's unlikely to happen at the drop of a hat as it does here.Plenty of eye candy, which helps to make the interminable 135-minutes running time slightly less unforgivable, the English countryside is appealing.  The cast is top shelf, and manages to create some good moments despite the appalling script.  Jude Law is excellent, and Cameron Diaz is not far behind.  Many appealing moments between these two, especially discovering the ""Tent.""  There is real tenderness and depth in seeing Graham, Law, and his two young daughters with Amanda; Graham is now revealing the entirety of his life to Amanda, and Amanda is finally getting an idea of love as commitment, not merely entertainment.  The Holiday could have used more moments like this.Most puzzling is how the other shoe is never quite dropped, Iris, Kate Winslet, is completely wasted in this film.  She's a pro, and makes the most of what's there, but there ain't much there, there.  If the film had really explored the trading houses/trading lives idea, the Iris story would have to mirror the Amanda story, be just as strong, and intersect with it in surprising ways.  It does none of these things - indeed, Eli Wallach almost shuffles away with the L.A. part of the picture because nothing is happening.  Jack Black is horribly miscast, in fact, just how did Jack Black make it into show business in the first place?Men will dismiss this movie out of hand as sentimental twaddle.  But I like to think that women viewers understand they're being pandered to and will respond by asking, ""Does Hollywood really believe we're this shallow?""",2,Let's Get Away From It All,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,3067,"['Movie', 'making', 'politics', 'have', 'grown', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'cases', 'products', 'are', 'packaged', 'not', 'merit', 'much', 'less', 'vision', 'marketability', 'Candidates', 'do', ""n't"", 'bravely', 'craft', 'innovative', 'platforms', 'then', 'sell', 'merits', 'public', 'simply', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'public', 'hear', 'then', 'devise', 'catchy', 'ways', 'saying', 'Likewise', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'avoid', 'artistic', 'risk', 'creativity', 'settling', 'instead', 'products', 'will', 'sell', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Holiday', 'clearly', 'targeted', 'women', 'market', 'particularly', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'drawn', 'frothy', 'weepy', 'dim-witted', 'romanticism', 'sentimentality', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'actually', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'Holiday', 'poor', 'writing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fiesta', 'plot', 'predictability', 'ham-fisted', 'direction', 'combine', 'make', 'vacation', 'reality', 'certain', 'have', 'craving', 'home.Among', 'film', 'innumerable', 'flaws', 'high', 'percentage', 'movie', 'jobs', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'real', 'jobs', 'real', 'people', 'pursue', 'Everyone', 'pots', 'money', 'journalist', 'book', 'editor', 'popular', 'writer', 'movie', 'trailer', 'editor', 'movie', 'score', 'composer', 'hot', 'air', 'balloonist', 'itinerant', 'Marcel', 'Marceau', 'impersonator', 'Amanda', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'house', 'so', 'ostentatious', 'would', 'embarrass', 'Pablo', 'Escobar', 'looking', 'shred', 'reality', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'premise', 'swapping', 'houses', 'absolute', 'stranger', 'equally', 'far-fetched', 'actual', 'practice', 'unlikely', 'happen', 'drop', 'hat', 'here.Plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'make', 'interminable', '135-minutes', 'running', 'time', 'slightly', 'less', 'unforgivable', 'English', 'countryside', 'appealing', 'cast', 'top', 'shelf', 'manages', 'create', 'good', 'moments', 'appalling', 'script', 'Jude', 'Law', 'excellent', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'not', 'far', 'Many', 'appealing', 'moments', 'two', 'especially', 'discovering', 'Tent', 'real', 'tenderness', 'depth', 'seeing', 'Graham', 'Law', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Amanda', 'Graham', 'now', 'revealing', 'entirety', 'life', 'Amanda', 'Amanda', 'finally', 'getting', 'idea', 'love', 'commitment', 'not', 'merely', 'entertainment', 'Holiday', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'moments', 'this.Most', 'puzzling', 'how', 'other', 'shoe', 'never', 'quite', 'dropped', 'Iris', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'completely', 'wasted', 'film', 'pro', 'most', 'what', 'there', 'there', 'ai', ""n't"", 'much', 'there', 'film', 'had', 'really', 'explored', 'trading', 'houses/trading', 'lives', 'idea', 'Iris', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'mirror', 'Amanda', 'story', 'be', 'just', 'strong', 'intersect', 'surprising', 'ways', 'none', 'things', 'indeed', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'almost', 'away', 'L.A.', 'part', 'picture', 'nothing', 'happening', 'Jack', 'Black', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'fact', 'just', 'how', 'did', 'Jack', 'Black', 'make', 'show', 'business', 'first', 'place', 'Men', 'will', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'hand', 'sentimental', 'twaddle', 'like', 'think', 'women', 'viewers', 'understand', ""'re"", 'being', 'pandered', 'will', 'respond', 'asking', 'Does', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'believe', ""'re"", 'shallow']",N/A

Are you confused yet?  Don't be, it's not nearly confusing as it sounds. Though it makes you feel sorry for the characters. Along the way Iris befriends a neighbor who is a writer from old Hollywood. That might be the best part of her story. It was for me at least, though Jack Black gives us a few laughs.Then the other story is about Amanda, played by Cameron Diaz.

As far as romantic comedies go, `The Holiday' gets it half right.The half they get right is the one starring Cameron Diaz and Jude Law.The film tells paralleled stories of two woman exchanging homes for a much needed break from reality.  Iris is currently devastated that her ex-boyfriend Jasper is now engaged to a co-worker.  Amanda is disgusted with her cheating boyfriend and overwhelmed by her job.  The two, in an act of desperation, exchange lives (homes, cars...the whole shebang) and attempt to unwind and refocus.  Of course, where there are desperate women there are kind hearted men who are tailor-made for helping them `refocus', and so insert Jude Law and...um...Jack Black?  Law plays Graham, Iris's brother, who infiltrates Amanda's alone time and makes himself a staple in her `healing'.  Jack Black plays Miles, a music composer who ignites a spark in Iris.The script and pacing of the film only half work.I will say that what I did enjoy about the film and that balance of `two stories' was that it was able to bounce around so that we didn't lose complete interest in the couples in question, which it would have been very easy to do.  Sadly though, the film is overly long and the couples themselves, at least Winslet and Black, are miscast.  Diaz and Law are quite good, especially Law who kind of OWNS this movie.  I love Kate Winslet with all my almighty heart and consider her an acting goddess and the single best working actress today, but romantic comedies are not her thing.  She just comes off dull and uninteresting, especially in the films first half.  She does pick up her pace a bit towards the end, but by then we have lost interest and moved on to Diaz, who is totally in her element and shines brightly here.  Black tries, and he works better than expected, but you can tell that he is in over his head.Nancy Meyers has a certain way about making her movies.  She understands certain aspects of the love game, but she also doesn't know how to edit herself.  I remember a similar problem (although not as unevenly toned) in `Something's Gotta Give', a film that hit a lot of great marks and then allowed itself to wear out its own welcome.  That is a problem I have with `The Holiday'.  It is too loosely constructed.  Some tighter pacing and some much needed edits could have consolidated this film and made it move quicker and hit harder.  Instead, it tends to drag on in places and loses some of its charm along the way.The film as a whole is ok, but I wanted more than that.",3,A serviceable diversion but far from a `treat'...,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,2653,"['film', 'whole', 'marginally', 'well', 'enough', 'validate', 'seeing', 'enjoying', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'constitute', 'adoring', 'As', 'far', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'go', 'Holiday', 'half', 'right.The', 'half', 'get', 'right', 'one', 'starring', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Jude', 'Law.The', 'film', 'tells', 'paralleled', 'stories', 'two', 'woman', 'exchanging', 'homes', 'much', 'needed', 'break', 'reality', 'Iris', 'currently', 'devastated', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Jasper', 'now', 'engaged', 'co-worker', 'Amanda', 'disgusted', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'overwhelmed', 'job', 'two', 'act', 'desperation', 'exchange', 'lives', 'homes', 'cars', 'whole', 'shebang', 'attempt', 'unwind', 'refocus', 'course', 'where', 'are', 'desperate', 'women', 'are', 'kind', 'hearted', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'tailor-made', 'helping', 'refocus', 'so', 'insert', 'Jude', 'Law', 'um', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Law', 'Graham', 'Iris', 'brother', 'who', 'Amanda', 'alone', 'time', 'staple', 'healing', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Miles', 'music', 'composer', 'who', 'spark', 'Iris.The', 'script', 'pacing', 'film', 'only', 'half', 'work.I', 'will', 'say', 'what', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'balance', 'two', 'stories', 'was', 'was', 'able', 'bounce', 'around', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'complete', 'interest', 'couples', 'question', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'do', 'Sadly', 'film', 'overly', 'long', 'couples', 'least', 'Winslet', 'Black', 'are', 'miscast', 'Diaz', 'Law', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'Law', 'who', 'kind', 'OWNS', 'movie', 'love', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'almighty', 'heart', 'consider', 'acting', 'goddess', 'single', 'best', 'working', 'actress', 'today', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'not', 'thing', 'just', 'off', 'dull', 'uninteresting', 'especially', 'films', 'first', 'half', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'bit', 'end', 'then', 'have', 'lost', 'interest', 'moved', 'Diaz', 'who', 'totally', 'element', 'shines', 'brightly', 'here', 'Black', 'better', 'expected', 'can', 'tell', 'head.Nancy', 'Meyers', 'certain', 'way', 'making', 'movies', 'certain', 'aspects', 'love', 'game', 'also', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'edit', 'remember', 'similar', 'problem', 'not', 'unevenly', 'toned', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'film', 'hit', 'lot', 'great', 'marks', 'then', 'allowed', 'wear', 'out', 'own', 'welcome', 'problem', 'have', 'Holiday', 'too', 'loosely', 'constructed', 'tighter', 'pacing', 'much', 'needed', 'edits', 'could', 'have', 'consolidated', 'film', 'made', 'move', 'quicker', 'hit', 'harder', 'Instead', 'drag', 'places', 'charm', 'way.The', 'film', 'whole', 'ok', 'wanted', 'more']",N/A

Vegan,"[0, 3]","The Holiday is the perfect movie to watch after you just finish a relationship, because it gives hope to men and women that there is a special someone for them. The movie is about two women trying to get over their last relationship and to do so they switching houses for the holidays. During the switch the two girls find the meaning of real love. In Iris's (Kate Winslet) case she was still in love with her ex that had left her for another woman, sometimes as women we tend to hold on to things that make us feel happy for moments but at the same times makes very unhappy. While Iris is in California she finds a new friend, a 90 year old man who advices her that by holding on to a friendship with her ex and that now takes advantage of her feeling towards him for his own benefit, is only hurting her. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) in the other side of the world finds a Graham (Jude Law) a man who has trouble showing who he really is; she discovers that is her problem too, and in the short time they spend together they find a way to be happy with themselves.  Iris finds Miles (Jack Black), who is going through something very similar to what she went through and helps him to solve it, and at the end get together.  Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet make this movie great. They both shine equally and neither tries to steal the limelight. This is one of the first roles that Kate has done as a comedy and it she does it very well.  If you want to lighten up your personal emotional baggage, set your life in perspective, here is movie that might just do that for you. Give it a try.",4,"Predictable, Yes.

She finally gets ""gumption"" and is finally able to break the shackles that bind her broken heart to this less than ideal man. Iris's coming to LA is her attempt to finally mend her heart and forget this scoundrel who when he isn't getting any attention follows her to America. This paves the way for Miles played by Jack Black who has mega problems of his own in the love department.There are two homes featured in the film (one in LA and one in the UK), two broken relationships, two women who exchange houses, two scoundrels and two new loves. Amanda played by Cameron Diaz not only has to get over her own bad relationship she needs to find the time to look into herself and figure out what she is about and how to open herself up to the possibility of love. Graham (also Iris's brother) played by Jude Law doesn't really know what he is looking for and says that he lacks ""follow through"" when in fact he has obligations which we discover soon enough.What I loved about this film is the growth that all of the characters exhibited and how they evolved in much better versions of themselves by the end. Even Arthur was able to do what he could not face and mounted the stairs like a trouper facing one of the most difficult tasks at his stage of life thanks in large part to his new pal Iris (Kate Winslet).This is a wonderful film which I have honestly watched over and over again and it never ceases to entertain me. I think everybody will see something of themselves in these characters and learn a little about life in the process.I think this film is more in the vein of Something's Gotta Give by the same producer and if you loved that movie, this one should also be a winner for you.A wonderful cast, familiar themes with a twist and lovely settings with beautiful people. What more could you want. And with the holiday season once more upon us, this is a nice film to dust off and enjoy once again.In blu-ray, your viewing pleasure is up a notch due to the clarity of the picture itself.Highly RecommendedBentley/2007The Holiday",5,"""You were meant to be a leading lady""",1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,2313,"['were', 'meant', 'be', 'leading', 'lady', 'Arthur', 'Iris', 'HolidayArthur', 'played', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'utters', 'words', 'Iris', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'somehow', 'Iris', 'realize', 'how', 'little', 'valued', 'non-relationship', 'had', 'Jasper', 'played', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'finally', 'gumption', 'finally', 'able', 'break', 'shackles', 'bind', 'broken', 'heart', 'less', 'ideal', 'man', 'Iris', 'coming', 'LA', 'attempt', 'finally', 'mend', 'heart', 'forget', 'scoundrel', 'who', 'when', ""n't"", 'getting', 'attention', 'America', 'way', 'Miles', 'played', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', 'mega', 'problems', 'own', 'love', 'are', 'two', 'homes', 'featured', 'film', 'one', 'LA', 'one', 'UK', 'two', 'broken', 'relationships', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'exchange', 'houses', 'two', 'scoundrels', 'two', 'new', 'loves', 'Amanda', 'played', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'own', 'bad', 'relationship', 'find', 'time', 'look', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'about', 'how', 'open', 'up', 'possibility', 'love', 'Graham', 'also', 'Iris', 'brother', 'played', 'Jude', 'Law', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'looking', 'follow', 'when', 'fact', 'obligations', 'discover', 'soon', 'enough.What', 'loved', 'film', 'growth', 'characters', 'exhibited', 'how', 'evolved', 'much', 'better', 'versions', 'end', 'Even', 'Arthur', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'could', 'not', 'face', 'mounted', 'stairs', 'trouper', 'facing', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'tasks', 'stage', 'life', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'new', 'pal', 'Iris', 'Kate', 'Winslet', '.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'have', 'honestly', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'entertain', 'think', 'everybody', 'will', 'see', 'something', 'characters', 'learn', 'little', 'life', 'process.I', 'think', 'film', 'more', 'vein', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'same', 'producer', 'loved', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'winner', 'you.A', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'familiar', 'themes', 'twist', 'lovely', 'settings', 'beautiful', 'people', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'want', 'holiday', 'season', 'once', 'more', 'upon', 'nice', 'film', 'dust', 'off', 'enjoy', 'once', 'again.In', 'blu-ray', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'up', 'notch', 'due', 'clarity', 'picture', 'RecommendedBentley/2007The', 'Holiday']",N/A

Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a cold-hearted workaholic who just threw her cheating boyfriend out of her house. Both of these women need a vacation, and via an online search, they agree to switch houses, for two weeks over Christmas. This is the premise of THE HOLIDAY, a too-long, sometimes sweet, occasionally funny romantic comedy.Iris travels to LA to live in Amanda's glamourous mansion while Amanda journeys to England to stay at Iris's quaint cottage. The movie then switches back and forth between the stories of the two women. After a few fish out of water scenes, both women begin getting involved. Amanda meets Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and they instantly sleep together. That right there is a turn off in a romantic comedy, even though Jude Law's character is later vindicated. Iris, meanwhile, makes friends with a sweet old neighbor as well as some of Amanda's friend, inclucing the composer Miles (Jack Black). The rest of the movie is the standard love story.My wife loved this movie of course, and I didn't like it. It was too long for me, and the format and the telling of the two stories gave neither story as much time as it needed to develop. Each character had a story to tell, and Graham and Miles got the short end. Jack Black, especially, was underused. Kate Winslett shines and Diaz was okay given how annoying her character was.

Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally, French Kiss, Bridget Jones' Diary, and The Whole Nine Yards are just a few of the more recent ones in this genre. THE HOLIDAY certainly falls headlong into this category, but does so with the addition of it taking place around the Christmas season. Writer/director/producer Nancy Meyers is very familiar in the RomCom arena. Her repertoire contains such gems as Private Benjamin and Father of the Bride (we'll forgivingly overlook the Father of the Bride II debacle for the moment).What The Holiday has going for it is some good dialogue and even better acting. Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black round out the prime roles. The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz, In Her Shoes) as she ejects her live-in boyfriend from her home. She's an intense young woman who's the CEO of her own upstart company that makes movie trailers. Her lifestyle is getting the better of her and she decides she needs a holiday.Iris (Kate Winslet, Finding Neverland) is in love with one of her close working colleagues and decides she needs a mental health getaway from the constrained English countryside. But what to do. Ah! House swap!Iris and Amanda fly across the Atlantic and take over each other's residences. Iris lands in L.A. to find a beautifully manicured house with every possible accouterment, while Amanda drags herself up the snow-laden driveway to a cramped but quaint English cottage. Initially Amanda hates what she finds. The quiet life doesn't suit her. But then she runs into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law, Closer) and a one-night stand turns into something Amanda never thought possible. Iris, in L.A., struggles with falling out of love with her ex-beau who is soon to be married but won't stop bothering her (he calls, sends emails, etc.). But Iris develops a unique friendship with Miles (Jack Black), a sound mixer for films, and she sees in him the same failings her own relationships have.Although very predictable, the powerhouse actors and actresses with the superb dialogue made this flick enjoyable.

What to do?  99 times out of 100, you step gingerly aside.So it is with most romantic comedies, stepping gingerly aside from the risk of cliche.  But this movie grins, steps back, and takes a running leap crashing down onto every single cliche known to modern romantic comedic entertainment.  Its like sitting in the front row at Sea World.  Initially, getting splashed and completely soaked (with foul tank water or cliches) doesn't feel so hot, but after a while you get into the show and everything is OK. So regarding the cliche smorgasbord, ""The Holiday"" is basically saying to us, ""So what? Get over it.""Aside from its self confidence, the film has a several other redeeming characteristics. One of the cliches it does manage to avoid is the contrived conflict scene.  When the characters discover potentially disarming new things about their romantic interest, its a cause for a smile, not an angry rant.  The scene in the kids' tent was very sweet, real and well done.  The 3-way telephone scene.  Funny!  Showing the Jack Black character as a good person, who enjoys the company of the old gentlemen.  Well done.Cameron Diaz lost weight for this film, and showed up with her ""A"" game.  Otherwise, the casting didn't seem right.  Kate Winslet, seemed to have difficulty with some of the scenes attempting humor, such as the Jack Black scene in the video store.  Is she laughing or crying?  It was awkward. Jack Black as a romantic interest?  Ouch.  He is funny of coures, and you get the feeling he was the funniest when he forgot the script!  Did Kate have a clause in her contract to avoid physical contract with Jack (did they ever kiss)?  If she did, could you blame her? And Jude law, as the clean cut widower?  That casting seemed somewhat at odds with his real-life run-ins with fidelity.  Oh well.  Thats Hollywood!I would have given four stars, but that ending, with everyone jumping around the room being soooo happy, was like the grand finale at the end of the 4th of July fireworks - a huge, immense, massive, final cliche crescendo.In a way, it was the perfect ending for ""The Holiday.""",3,A Stunning Collage of Cliches!,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,2160,"['encounter', 'large', 'puddle', 'street', 'one', 'day', 'What', 'do', '99', 'times', '100', 'step', 'gingerly', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'stepping', 'gingerly', 'aside', 'risk', 'cliche', 'movie', 'steps', 'back', 'running', 'leap', 'crashing', 'down', 'single', 'cliche', 'known', 'modern', 'romantic', 'comedic', 'entertainment', 'sitting', 'front', 'row', 'Sea', 'World', 'Initially', 'getting', 'splashed', 'completely', 'soaked', 'foul', 'tank', 'water', 'cliches', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'hot', 'while', 'get', 'show', 'everything', 'OK', 'So', 'regarding', 'cliche', 'smorgasbord', 'Holiday', 'basically', 'saying', 'So', 'what', 'Get', 'Aside', 'self', 'confidence', 'film', 'several', 'other', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'One', 'cliches', 'manage', 'avoid', 'contrived', 'conflict', 'scene', 'When', 'characters', 'discover', 'potentially', 'disarming', 'new', 'things', 'romantic', 'interest', 'cause', 'smile', 'not', 'angry', 'rant', 'scene', 'kids', 'tent', 'was', 'very', 'sweet', 'real', 'well', 'done', '3-way', 'telephone', 'scene', 'Funny', 'Showing', 'Jack', 'Black', 'character', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'company', 'old', 'gentlemen', 'Well', 'Diaz', 'lost', 'weight', 'film', 'showed', 'up', 'A', 'game', 'Otherwise', 'casting', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'seemed', 'have', 'difficulty', 'scenes', 'attempting', 'humor', 'such', 'Jack', 'Black', 'scene', 'video', 'store', 'laughing', 'crying', 'was', 'awkward', 'Jack', 'Black', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Ouch', 'funny', 'coures', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', 'funniest', 'when', 'forgot', 'script', 'Did', 'Kate', 'have', 'clause', 'contract', 'avoid', 'physical', 'contract', 'Jack', 'did', 'ever', 'kiss', 'did', 'could', 'blame', 'Jude', 'law', 'clean', 'cut', 'widower', 'casting', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'odds', 'real-life', 'run-ins', 'fidelity', 'Oh', 'well', 'Thats', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'stars', 'ending', 'everyone', 'jumping', 'room', 'being', 'soooo', 'happy', 'was', 'grand', 'finale', 'end', '4th', 'July', 'huge', 'immense', 'massive', 'final', 'cliche', 'crescendo.In', 'way', 'was', 'perfect', 'ending', 'Holiday']",N/A

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 3]","[In the low raspy voice of Don LaFontaine, King of the Movie Trailer Voice-Overs]: In a world where good women are taken for granted by bad men, two women decide to switch houses in order to get out of town for the holidays. One in England, one in Los Angeles, they soon find that they have switched more than houses, they've switched lives that don't make sense for ones that do, albeit in an extremely complicated fashion.Iris (Kate Winslet), who works for a London newspaper has just learned that Jasper Bloom (Rufus Sewell), a bounder and a cad that she is foolishly in love with, is engaged to be married--but not to her. Her job as a writer is to cover the engagement before the other papers scoop them. I don't think so. She goes online and offers her home to swap for someone somewhere else so she can leave this tangled mess and fall out of love with Jasper.Meanwhile Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) has just booted her philandering boy friend out and is also looking to make herself scarce. She has a very successful company that makes movie trailers, is a bit of a workaholic, and rarely vacations. She takes up Iris on her offer, and sets out for jolly old England. One of Amanda's issues is that no matter how messy the break up, she won't cry. Another is that from working so much on movie trailers, she tends to see her own life in those terms and imagines movie trailers that comment on the events in her life.This provides a thread of continuity that runs throughout this film, with two other characters from the world of Hollywood that will soon become a part of Iris' life. First there is Amanda's elderly neighbor Arthur Abbot (Eli Wallach), an old school screenwriter. Next she meets Miles (Jack Black), a film soundtrack composer with a healthy respect for great film composers of the past. When they meet Iris, they 'meet cute,' though Iris doesn't know it at the time. Arthur will later explain exactly what a 'meet cute' is, and also that she is a leading lady but she's acting like the best friend. More on that later, but here is Arthur's definition of the 'meet cute.'---------------Arthur Abbott: Say a man and a woman both need something to sleep in and both go to the same men's pajama department. The man says to the salesman, ""I just need bottoms,"" and the woman says, ""I just need a top."" They look at each other and that's the 'meet cute.'===========This is how Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper met in 1938's Bluebeard's Eighth Wife. Since Arthur is 90, uses a walker, and Iris finds him wandering about unable to remember where he lives, their 'meet cute' is somewhat circumscribed. But perhaps he just needs her to jog his memory, and soon Arthur is remembering all kinds of interesting stories from his days as a screenwriter in Hollywood's Golden Age. He also offers Iris lots of insight and wisdom, and their relationship provides the emotional highpoint of the film.------------------Iris: I like corny. I'm looking for corny in my life.==============Jude Law and Cameron Diaz would appear to be the leading man and leading lady, respectively. Jude Law plays Iris' brother Graham, a man with a complicated life involving multiple women:------------------Sophie: Daddy, she has more marshmallows than I do.Graham: No she doesn't, you each have five.[to Amanda]Graham: You have five too.Amanda: Thanks==========Law and Diaz do fine as the ostensible first couple in this Rom Com, but Kate Winslet, as Arthur tells her, is the real leading lady. Her growing flirtation with Miles also provides a very amusing scene in a video store where Jack Black gives Kate quite a course in movie soundtrack music appreciation. In fact, every scene with Jack Black and Winslet plays out like one long 'meet cute.' There is also a scene between her and Rufus Sewell, an intense actor who played Alexander Hamilton in the award winning miniseries John Adams, about the second President of the United States. Rumor has it that in real life Winslet and Sewell were an item, and one can't help but wonder if some of the scenes between Iris and Jasper were fueled by unresolved anger. One hopes that Winslet gathered some catharsis from it, if not complete closure.------------------Iris: I have found almost everything ever written about love to be true. Shakespeare said, ""Journeys end in lovers meeting."" What an extraordinary thought.===============The Bottom Line is that The Holiday was an extremely competent Romantic Comedy by writer/director Nancy Meyers that overlaid the usual structure of two couples getting together, one couple being kind of comic relief, with another theme that paid tribute to great films of the past, the tradition of films, especially great Romantic Comedies of the past, and great movie scores. Jack Black, though part of the 'comic relief couple' stole the show with his amusing antics, and Kate Winslet was the true leading lady.------------------Miles: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kiss you twice and then linger on the second one.================Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind(2004) Kate Winslet was Clementine KruczynskiSchool of Rock (Widescreen Edition)(2003) Jack Black was Dewey

Kate Winslet showed heart (kind to the elderly neighbour), taste  and intelligence with a longing for true love. Jack Black showed sense. And the big, spacious and ambient L.A. mansion surely helps a lot.Cameron Diaz - Jude Law 's storyline in Surrey, on the other hand, appears to be shallow and unconvincing. The chemistry between Cameron and Jude seem to be non-existing. When they first met in the Surrey cottage, the way they giggled, conversed and the things they said were teenage stuff and predictable. No way could this be an indispensable and successful Hollywood trailer maker with a sharp sense. However, there were shots of the picturesque Surrey cottage that were simply postcard perfect. The movie could do a lot better if the story in Surrey is given more substance and heart.",3,Kate Winslet and Jack Black rock,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,941,"['pairs', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Jack', 'Black', 'L.A.', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Jude', 'Law', 'U.K.', 'must', 'say', 'L.A.', 'pair', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'showed', 'heart', 'kind', 'elderly', 'neighbour', 'taste', 'intelligence', 'longing', 'true', 'love', 'Jack', 'Black', 'showed', 'sense', 'big', 'spacious', 'ambient', 'L.A.', 'mansion', 'surely', 'lot.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Jude', 'Law', 'storyline', 'Surrey', 'other', 'hand', 'be', 'shallow', 'unconvincing', 'chemistry', 'Cameron', 'Jude', 'seem', 'be', 'non-existing', 'When', 'first', 'met', 'Surrey', 'cottage', 'way', 'giggled', 'conversed', 'things', 'said', 'were', 'teenage', 'stuff', 'predictable', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'indispensable', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'trailer', 'maker', 'sharp', 'sense', 'However', 'were', 'shots', 'picturesque', 'Surrey', 'cottage', 'were', 'simply', 'postcard', 'perfect', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'better', 'story', 'Surrey', 'given', 'more', 'substance', 'heart']",N/A
1049084,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000MQC9H4,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 4]","It's a strange thing reviewing a romantic comedy since, as a single guy, it almost defeats the purpose of a movie like this. This was meant to be rented with your significant other, dimmed lights and all, and enjoying it with just the two of you. So can the movie exist for a single person? Possibly. It'll either make you nostalgic for relationships that actually worked, or depressed that you're not in one that idyllic. It's also a bit too much of a movie but at least it's quite charming anyway.Los Angeles film producer Amanda has just thrown out her cheating boyfriend and needs a break. She goes online and finds a unique site: you can swap houses for a couple weeks and you stay at their place and they stay at yours. This is attractive to Iris, England native who has unrequited love for her possessive cad of an ex-boyfriend. They swap houses and pretty soon Amanda strikes a relationship with Iris' brother Graham while Iris meets an aging screenwriting legend and meets Miles, a film composer. Both women get caught up in possible relationships with both aware that their stay isn't permanent.Like in some multiple storyline films, there's always that one that you feel more interested in. For Babel, I was more compelled by the Japanese storyline than anything and the Mexico segments of Traffic were completely better than the rest. Here, I tend to get more interested in the Kate Winslet/Jack Black story simply because Winslet just feels like a more endearing character. I don't think she's ever been this adorable, however the fault comes from the relationship with Black since it develops at an almost slow burn and it just doesn't have the chemistry it needs. The Cameron Diaz/Jude Law story feels the more adult but for some reason I didn't get that drawn into it.2 things bugged me about the film. One, is that there's a bit of pretentious parts in the film, as if writer/director Nancy Meyers wanted to use characters to unleash some Hollywood lowblows such as the old screenwriter (Eli Wallach) lamenting about the age that didn't have DVD, Blockbuster and cineplexes. Then there's the big one where he says outright a film has to ""make money on the first weekend or it'll fail"". I didn't mind the film professions some of the characters had but to be that nailing on the head just seemed out of place. The other is the length where it just feels too long for a romantic comedy. It helps build films and depth but here it feels almost unneeded.I don't know if it'll work for couples since I watched it as a single guy but taken as such, it's pretty good but probably not really great.",4,"As a single guy, I rather enjoyed it",1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,2607,"['strange', 'thing', 'reviewing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'single', 'guy', 'almost', 'purpose', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'rented', 'significant', 'other', 'dimmed', 'lights', 'enjoying', 'just', 'two', 'can', 'movie', 'exist', 'single', 'person', 'Possibly', ""'ll"", 'either', 'make', 'nostalgic', 'relationships', 'actually', 'worked', 'depressed', ""'re"", 'not', 'one', 'idyllic', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'least', 'quite', 'charming', 'anyway.Los', 'Angeles', 'film', 'producer', 'Amanda', 'just', 'thrown', 'out', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'break', 'online', 'unique', 'site', 'can', 'swap', 'houses', 'couple', 'weeks', 'stay', 'place', 'stay', 'yours', 'attractive', 'Iris', 'England', 'native', 'who', 'unrequited', 'love', 'possessive', 'cad', 'ex-boyfriend', 'swap', 'houses', 'pretty', 'soon', 'Amanda', 'relationship', 'Iris', 'brother', 'Graham', 'Iris', 'aging', 'screenwriting', 'legend', 'meets', 'Miles', 'film', 'composer', 'women', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'possible', 'relationships', 'aware', 'stay', ""n't"", 'permanent.Like', 'multiple', 'storyline', 'films', 'always', 'one', 'feel', 'more', 'interested', 'Babel', 'was', 'more', 'compelled', 'Japanese', 'storyline', 'anything', 'Mexico', 'segments', 'Traffic', 'were', 'completely', 'better', 'rest', 'Here', 'tend', 'get', 'more', 'interested', 'Kate', 'Winslet/Jack', 'Black', 'story', 'simply', 'Winslet', 'just', 'feels', 'more', 'endearing', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'been', 'adorable', 'however', 'fault', 'relationship', 'Black', 'almost', 'slow', 'burn', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'chemistry', 'Cameron', 'Diaz/Jude', 'Law', 'story', 'more', 'adult', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'drawn', 'it.2', 'things', 'bugged', 'film', 'One', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'parts', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'wanted', 'use', 'characters', 'unleash', 'Hollywood', 'lowblows', 'such', 'old', 'screenwriter', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'lamenting', 'age', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVD', 'Blockbuster', 'cineplexes', 'Then', 'big', 'one', 'where', 'outright', 'film', 'make', 'money', 'first', 'weekend', ""'ll"", 'fail', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'film', 'professions', 'characters', 'had', 'be', 'nailing', 'head', 'just', 'seemed', 'place', 'other', 'length', 'where', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'long', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'build', 'films', 'depth', 'here', 'almost', 'unneeded.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'work', 'couples', 'watched', 'single', 'guy', 'taken', 'such', 'pretty', 'good', 'probably', 'not', 'really', 'great']",N/A

The Holiday is a sweet, feel-good romantic movie that impresses in some areas and underwhelms in others.  More on that later. Amanda (Cameron Diaz), a creator of movie trailers from L.A., has just broken up with her boyfriend and wants to get away and be alone for a while. Iris (Kate Winslet), a London newspaper writer, is heartbroken as well.  The man, a colleague, she loves and has pined over for years has become engaged to another woman and she wants to put some distance between them.  So when Amanda finds a home exchange travel program on the Internet (using Google, a very obvious product placement ad within the film) and finds the perfect vacation spot -- a small, picturesque cottage in Surrey, England -- she contacts the owner (Iris) and they agree to trade places for a couple of weeks.  Iris has the time of her life in L.A., where she meets some interesting people (including a retired screenwriter played by veteran actor Elli Wallach) and becomes friends with a sweet film music composer (Jack Black), whereas Amanda is bored out of her mind... until she meets Iris's gorgeous and enigmatic brother (Jude Law).This is the sort of movie you either want to enjoy with your girlfriends or watch by yourself when you're in the mood for something warm and fuzzy.  The script is well written and it isn't the typical romantic comedy in that the characters are one-dimensional for the most part.  In this film, you get moving performances, especially from Kate Winslet.  She once again showcases her talent in this one and her character's kindness and transparency to loving and caring for others is wonderful.  I was also impressed with the fact that she and Black had chemistry.  I often avoid a Jack Black movie like the plague, but he was actually endearing in this film.  Cameron Diaz underwhelms as Amanda though.  She played a character not unlike most of her romantic comedy heroines.  Even though I liked the chemistry between her and Jude Law, I found myself more interested in Winslet and Black.  As for the setting, I loved the beautiful takes of Iris's English cottage and the village she lives in.  They were so much more eye-catching than the mansions and palm trees in Los Angeles.  All in all, this is a great film.  The DVD is not that great though.  The picture quality is not that great and you don't get any special features (at least not the one I got).

So when I found this one, starring Kate Winslet (whom I adore), I thought, can't go wrong, right?Wrong.Iris Sempkins (Kate Winslet) of Surrey has been pining after Jasper for three years.  Her life goes into an uproar when he suddenly reveals he is engaged.  Meanwhile, in LA, Amanda (Cameron Diaz) breaks up with her boyfriend (Edward Burns) when she finds out he was cheating with his receptionist.  On a whim, she decides to house exchange with Iris over the Christmas holiday.  While on Holiday, Amanda meets Graham, Iris' hot older brother (Jude Law).  In LA, Iris meets Miles, Amanda's ex-boyfriend's friend (Jack Black).  And the rest, as you might say, is history.Kate Winslet and Jack Black's sidestory is absolutely adorable.  It is muted, it is subtle, it is cute, it is everything you would want in a romantic comedy.  They had real chemistry together, and I was definitely rooting for them to get together in the end.I also adored the story with Iris and the screenwriter.  Very sweet and makes you realize that relationships are more than just between lovers, family members, you get the picture.And, I know it's petty, but I loved the Dustin Hoffman cameo.  Funny!But the majority of the story centers around the ""love"" (AKA ""lust"") between Amanda and Graham.  First off, while I liked Amanda's beginning (how she kicked out her boyfriend), I thought her story increasingly became boring and stupid, particularly right around Graham's ""drunken"" entrance.  I really hated Hollywood's ""Well, you're drunk, I don't know you, so I think we should have sex"" mentality.  WTF?  Who does this sort of irresponsible thing?  Maybe a teenager, maybe a college student, but a successful movie producer?  And a widower?!  With two young daughters?  Doesn't at least Graham realize that love doesn't abound from a one night stand with a drunk stranger?  I don't see how Hollywood thinks they can pull this horrible coupling off without making the rest of the world raise their eyebrows in skepticism.Not to mention, Jude Law and Cameron Diaz have no chemistry with each other.  It's all physical.  Jude Law is a hunk; Cameron Diaz sexy.  There is nothing else between the two of them, and yet most of the movie centers on them and their falling in lust.  Boring!In fact, the movie bored me so much (well, at least the parts that Kate Winslet and Jack Black weren't in) that I brought out my computer to surf the net at the same time.  I almost never do that.My advice?  If you like Kate Winslet and Jack Black, I would watch their scenes and skip over everything else.  You'll thank me for it in the end.Brought to you by:*C.S.

1049093,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000MQC9H4,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 5]","Excited as I was to see `The Holiday' I was very skeptical.  I had heard some horrible things about this movie from some of the critics, and while I generally avoid anything the critics have to say, when the critics say something bad about Kate Winslet (an actress who NEVER gets a bad review) then I get a little scared.  As the credits began to roll though I realized that critics are seldom ever right and if it stars Kate Winslet it can't be bad...I mean really, when has she ever gone awry?`The Holiday' ends up unfolding as a double feature, and for the most part it's split right down the middle, the first half dealing heavily between Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Graham (Jude Law) and the second half dealing more with Iris (Kate Winslet) and Miles (Jack Black) and this works well beings that for the first half Kate comes off somewhat dull and Jack is all but nonexistent, and right about the time of the movie that you start losing interest in Cameron, Kate steps up her game and Jack appears in almost every frame...it really does work well.So the story follows Iris and Amanda as they, sick and tired of their lives at the moment, decide to trade homes, cars and lives for the Christmas holiday in an attempt to escape the stress and find themselves.  Iris has been pining for her co-worker and ex-boyfriend Jasper (Rufus Sewell) for three long years only to have him get engaged to another co-worker without having the decency to let Iris know.  Amanda has become all but detached from her cheating boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) and has lost herself in her work.  Both Iris and Amanda realize they really, truly NEED a vacation.So, after meeting online Iris heads to LA and Amanda to London and it's there that their lives are soon forever changed.  Like I said, the first half of this movie BELONGS to Cameron and Jude, especially Jude who in actuality owned this whole movie proving that he is such a talented actor.  Kate and Jack quickly become background characters as Amanda and Graham (Iris's brother) begin their passionate affair.  Right about the time that they encounter the same trouble most couple endure Iris and Miles begin to get closer and closer and take over the film, becoming the focus of the second act sort-of-speak.Nancy Meyers, who also wrote and directed `Something's Gotta Give', proves that she is capable of making a sweet comedy that grabs you and makes you smile.  Cameron is delightful here, and her redition of the crying fits that made Diane's character so wonderful in `Something's Gotta Give' is priceless.  Kate, shines bright in the second half, and her meandering in the beginning of the film I blame solely on the script that kept her strapped until she was needed.  Jude Law is utterly fantastic, and as I mentioned, the best performance here and Jack Black is funny and witty, and while he may have been a bit miscast he wasn't as dreadful as he could have been.  Let's just say that by the time he's on the screen Kate has picked up so much slack he could have drooled in a corner and he would have been fine.So, `The Holiday' may be just what you need this holiday, something sweet, funny and smart...something you'll remember as a delightful experience and one I'm sure you'll revisit.

The film premise was good but about 50% of the movie was weak, not funny, and unreal.From previews Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz's characters switch homes (one in Great Britain the other in the US, California) for the Holidays and unexpectedly find romance.Early in the film Kate's current romance and office environment seem to be likened to ""Bridget Jones Diary"" (one of my favorites).  But the extreme Kate's character tries before leaving for the US doesn't seem believable (Bridget would have simply eaten a couple gallons of ice cream and called it a day).Then Kate's character agrees to the home exchange with no online picture or prescreening, just Cameron's description that her California home was larger then Kate's.  Not too believable and pretty unsafe but I ignored it for the sake of entertainment.What I couldn't ignore is the romance between Jack and Kate's characters.Jack Black wasn't cast well for this part.  Sometimes Jack seemed to be portraying a gay friend just hanging out with Kate.  Other times he seemed like a full size Chucky doll (a child's possessed doll from the movie ""Child's Play"") when he smiled or tried to be cute interacting with Kate's character, he looked creepy.  It felt like Kate really pushed herself to even laugh at Jack's characters weak jokes.  The writers or someone seemed to be aware of the mismatch so they added additional characters and sub plots for this part of the film.  It didn't help.  This part of the film isn't romantic, funny or even entertaining.It was bad.At the beginning of the film Cameron's interaction with her current boyfriend seemed forced with no chemistry.  It looked the way it was, an actor just coming in for a few scenes and not really building a rapport with the other actor.Then Cameron's character traveling to a town in Great Britain she never heard of, to a home she just found on the internet 2 days earlier,  and alone seemed unreal too, But..............On the positive side, Cameron played Cameron, a very stylish, kind of playful American girl.  Jude played an attractive partying bachelor character on the surface but a sensitive and protective man deep down.  They had great chemistry together and were a believable couple.  The Christmassy atmosphere depicted in Great Britain with the snow and country side gave the film that holiday feel and later the addition of some really sweet kids made this part of the film likable.  The ending was nice too (no dialog), and a beautiful country house covered in snow and twinkling lights.If you laugh easily and ignore a lot of problems with this film, you might like it.I didn't.

1049110,A2Z44AN3F2IN61,B000MQC9H4,D. K. Stokes,"[0, 0]","Amanda in L.A. (Cameron Diaz) and Iris in Surrey (Kate Winslet) are both having man problems: Amanda's just broken up with her cheating boyfriend, and Iris's sort-of ex has just gotten engaged. They both decide a vacation is in order, and with the help of a house-swapping website, trade houses for two weeks.The ""comedy"" part of ""romantic comedy"" comes in when the two women have to adjust to different lifestyles. I've never been to either England or California, but it rang pretty true to me, and didn't seem too exaggerated. The jet lag was definitely a realistic factor.Amanda's first night at Iris's cottage, there's a knock at the door and she opens it to a very drunk, very good-looking man who turns out to be Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law). She decides a one-night stand with a perfect stranger would be a great way to get over her ex. Graham's drunk, but he's not an idiot, so he obliges. They're both a little more affected than they expected, and they reluctantly start a romance they know has no future.Iris, meanwhile, answers the door to a couple: Miles (Jack Black), who's a friend of Amanda's ex, and his girlfriend. Iris and Miles get a romance, too, but it moves much more slowly, and is much more complicated. Iris's ex, Jasper, doesn't want to let her go despite the fact that he's marrying another woman--he calls and sends his manuscript for her to proofread, and tells her he can't do without her. The distance is helping, but keeping busy is better, and Iris manages that when she befriends one of Amanda's neighbors, an elderly screenwriter.Unfortunately, more time was spent on Hollywood's idea of the prettier couple--Diaz and Law--despite the fact that their story was less complex. On the plus side, the movie was over two hours long (138 minutes), so neither story felt too rushed.Iris and Miles's romance was more believable. They were both dealing with similar break-up issues, and because of the slower pace of their relationship, it was easier to see them becoming drawn to each other and appreciating each other's strengths. Iris's issues were extremely familiar, so that likely had something to do with why I was more drawn to her story.Amanda and Graham's romance seemed to be more simple chemistry, and while both characters were likable and were dealing with issues that were solved by the relationship (Amanda keeps relationships on the surface, and Graham's got some emotional trauma and responsibility), it wasn't really clear that each was the specific person the other needed in their life.I do have to say I appreciated the ending.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 3]","Normally I run (screaming) from chick flicks (not to mention romcoms), but when a film appears featuring the charismatic talent (not to mention physically stunning) of Kate Winslet, it also commands my undivided attention.  So I sat through THE HOLIDAY and grimaced and twitched; when it was over I wanted to have a good cry and bake a cake and call my grandmother.  Actually I wanted to do none of the above, but I did feel some considerable estrogen exposure.THE HOLIDAY features two professional women unlucky in love who swap homes for Christmas to forget their troubles.  Thus Winslet travels to posh LA, while her counterpart (Cameron Diaz) arrives at Winslet's picturesque cottage in England.  And--of course--both ladies encounter romantic interests in the form of Winslet's brother (Jude Law), who captivates Diaz, and the smirking Jack Black, who wows Winslet (note the succession of ""w""s).  It's all contrived, predictable, and marginally humorous (but please:  Jack Black as a romantic interest is a howler), with a closing scene in London on New Year's Eve so syrupy and gooey I had to go out on the driveway and gargle gravel just to get the bubblegum taste out of my mouth.  Winslet demonstrates some chops, while Diaz and Law seem to phone their performances in, with the near-centenarian Eli Wallach appearing in a most gracious role.  All in all THE HOLIDAY nominally entertains, as long as the viewer doesn't feel compelled to watch in high heels.D.

More problems persist when three of the four principals show an affinity for screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers' brand of breezy but manipulative farce, while the fourth seems like he doesn't belong in the movie at all. A calculated throwback to golden-era Hollywood in more ways than one, the stacked-deck premise is simple enough - two women, Amanda in LA and Iris in England, both unlucky in love, decide impulsively to switch houses during the Christmas holiday with the intent of celebrating their emancipation from men bad for them.Amanda's side of the story is the more pleasurable of the two because ironically, it doesn't veer too much from formula. At first, Cameron Diaz's performance as type-A movie trailer producer Amanda seems heavily exaggerated, but once she meets Jude Law, very Grant-like (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) as Iris' smooth-talking brother Graham, she settles down as he is the epitome of the Sensitive Man for reasons that become clear soon enough. Probably because the actors are such striking people, their chemistry is palpable and unforced, as their characters pretend not to fall in love when it is obvious they are. Iris' LA adventure does not fare as well. Although Kate Winslet is dependably winning as Iris, her natural vibrancy and beauty seem at odds with her role as a doormat to an ex-boyfriend who keeps stringing her along.The stateside romance is also more convoluted as it involves her almost-instant friendship with an aged Hollywood screenwriter who refuses to be the subject of an industry tribute. It's nice to see 91-year old Eli Wallach play the curmudgeonly writer with old-world charm and a wry sense of humor, but the subplot feels forced as an excuse to provide a more direct connection to the Hollywood film classics. Even worse, Jack Black is completely out of his element as Miles, a sardonic film composer already in a shaky relationship with an actress. That Iris and Miles get together seems more like an afterthought since there is zero chemistry between Winslet and Black. The resulting imbalance between the two storylines adds to the interminable feel of the movie's 136-minute running time.Even though there are a handful of funny sight gags (mostly spotlighting Diaz) and a clever three-way phone conversation with Iris at the center, the film is burdened by its leisurely pacing and Meyers' indulgent approach to the material. Thanks to Jon Hutman's picture-postcard sets, especially of the English countryside, and Hans Zimmer's appropriately romantic score, it certainly feels like the Hollywood confection that she was trying to replicate. The 2007 DVD has a robust commentary track courtesy of Meyers and several of her crew like Zimmer, Hutman and editor Joe Hutshing but featuring none of the stars. There is also an eighteen-minute making-of featurette, pretty standard, along with a number of previews for current and upcoming theatrical releases like ""Spider-Man 3"".",3,"Three Out of Four Stars Charm in an Overlong, Formulaic Comedy That Gets It Right Half the Time",1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,3129,"['about', '45', 'minutes', 'overdone', 'laborious', 'set-up', 'least', 'half', 'overlong', 'dual-track', '2006', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'flight', 'other', 'half', 'stubbornly', 'contrived', 'More', 'problems', 'persist', 'when', 'three', 'four', 'principals', 'show', 'affinity', 'screenwriter/director', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'brand', 'breezy', 'manipulative', 'farce', 'fourth', ""n't"", 'belong', 'movie', 'A', 'calculated', 'throwback', 'golden-era', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'stacked-deck', 'premise', 'simple', 'enough', 'two', 'women', 'Amanda', 'LA', 'Iris', 'England', 'unlucky', 'love', 'decide', 'impulsively', 'switch', 'houses', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'intent', 'celebrating', 'emancipation', 'men', 'bad', 'them.Amanda', 'side', 'story', 'more', 'pleasurable', 'two', 'ironically', ""n't"", 'veer', 'too', 'much', 'formula', 'first', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'performance', 'type-A', 'movie', 'trailer', 'producer', 'Amanda', 'heavily', 'exaggerated', 'once', 'Jude', 'Law', 'very', 'Grant-like', 'Cary', 'Hugh', 'take', 'pick', 'Iris', 'smooth-talking', 'brother', 'Graham', 'down', 'epitome', 'Sensitive', 'Man', 'reasons', 'become', 'clear', 'soon', 'enough', 'Probably', 'actors', 'are', 'such', 'striking', 'people', 'chemistry', 'palpable', 'unforced', 'characters', 'pretend', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'when', 'obvious', 'are', 'Iris', 'LA', 'adventure', 'not', 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'dependably', 'winning', 'Iris', 'natural', 'vibrancy', 'beauty', 'seem', 'odds', 'role', 'doormat', 'ex-boyfriend', 'who', 'stringing', 'along.The', 'stateside', 'romance', 'also', 'more', 'convoluted', 'almost-instant', 'friendship', 'aged', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'be', 'subject', 'industry', 'tribute', 'nice', 'see', '91-year', 'old', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'play', 'curmudgeonly', 'writer', 'old-world', 'charm', 'wry', 'sense', 'humor', 'subplot', 'feels', 'forced', 'excuse', 'provide', 'more', 'direct', 'connection', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'classics', 'Even', 'worse', 'Jack', 'Black', 'completely', 'element', 'Miles', 'sardonic', 'film', 'composer', 'already', 'shaky', 'relationship', 'actress', 'Iris', 'Miles', 'get', 'together', 'more', 'afterthought', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'Winslet', 'Black', 'resulting', 'imbalance', 'two', 'storylines', 'interminable', 'feel', 'movie', '136-minute', 'running', 'time.Even', 'are', 'handful', 'funny', 'sight', 'gags', 'mostly', 'spotlighting', 'Diaz', 'clever', 'three-way', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Iris', 'center', 'film', 'burdened', 'leisurely', 'pacing', 'Meyers', 'indulgent', 'approach', 'material', 'Thanks', 'Jon', 'Hutman', 'picture-postcard', 'sets', 'especially', 'English', 'countryside', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'appropriately', 'romantic', 'score', 'certainly', 'Hollywood', 'confection', 'was', 'trying', 'replicate', '2007', 'DVD', 'robust', 'commentary', 'track', 'courtesy', 'Meyers', 'several', 'crew', 'Zimmer', 'Hutman', 'editor', 'Joe', 'Hutshing', 'featuring', 'none', 'stars', 'also', 'eighteen-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'pretty', 'standard', 'number', 'previews', 'current', 'upcoming', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'Spider-Man', '3']",N/A

When I saw the advertisements on tv, I thought that it was going to be simply a story revolving around Christmas because of the title and the time of year that it was released. I saw that Jack Black was in it and I have never liked anything he has ever done before; probably not because he's a bad actor, but because his other movies have been slapstick comedies with the purpose of being funny only and I usually hate that. Jude Law is one of my favorite actors around today, but I thought before I actually rented the DVD that this project was more than likely a waste of his considerable talent. I like Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet but I thought, how good can they be in something like this, a romantic comedy?That was before I had received notices by word of mouth and before I read some of the reviews here on [...]. Several friends had really liked it, and I found out that the same person who was involved with writing SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE was involved with writing THE HOLIDAY. I had a coupon for a free movie at my local DVD store and I decided that if I hated it, at least I wouldn't lose any money in the process. To my amazement I was very pleasantly surprised.All four of the leads were as charming as they could be in their respective roles and you couldn't help but like all of them. Compared with some of their former objects of affections in the story, they were all real catches. The humor was never just for humor's sake and I found myself caught up in their prospective problems. Cameron Diaz was never more human than she was in her role here.  Kate Winslet was never more vulnerable and likable. Jude Law showed that this was not a waste of his considerable talent because he has more charm in his little toe in this role than most people have in their whole bodies. Jack Black was funny  but not just funny for funny's sake and you want so badly for his character to find someone who can appreciate him. Even Eli Wallach who I remember as a bad guy from many movies is delightful in this film.

That's not the film of the next century, nor decade. That's not even the comedy of the present decade. It is just a decent comedy, romantic, sentimental and happy to the highest uppermost acme of what we can conceive as a happy ending. In fact the structure is Shakespearian to the very detail in every scene. ""As You like It"" is the model and here we are even nearly modest, shy about the happy ending. Shakespeare managed to have four marriages at the end of his play, and he will do it again at the end of his ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". Here we have only two couples who find their happy ending in England, because frankly such a thing cannot happen in Los Angeles the country of fake make-believe. The real stuff can only happen in the depth of Surrey, with a cow in the back garden and a tent in the girl's bedroom. But it is funny and at the same time it is slightly ironically critical of what Hollywood has become in its superficial illusionary virtual reality based on special effects and canned sentiments and roles, when it is not preserved music that comes out of the brain of an elevator, even if the British may call that a lift that can lift your fat, flesh and bones but will never lift, not to speak of elevating, your artistic and musical senses. And to prove his point, the director, though I should say directress to be accurate even if that is not politically correct and I cannot use a word like directing person that has not yet succeeded to escalator-ize itself up to the tip of my tongue, has a cameo of an aging Dustin Hoffman appearing in the aisles of a DVD store in the background of ""The Graduate"" where he was a juicy short student looking for the way to lose his maidenhead or should I say bachelor-head between the legs of a ripe woman. Maybe Hollywood might be becoming in the coming decade realistic and more human, closer to real life, probably under the influence of the competition that is already simmering in India, in China, in Asia in general, and in Europe of course, though Europe is still bogged up in the mud of the tradition of cultural protectionism which is nothing but the impotence in front of the challenge that comes from outside. A funny film and a question at the end: how in hell are they going to fly a cow from London's Heathrow Airport to Los Angeles International Airport? I guess Air France will volunteer since they are the European specialist of the air-lift of all kinds of cattle in between two strikes when the passengers are treated by the striking personnel as samples of the valueless cattle that deserves nothing  but being sent to the local slaughterhouse to get out of the way of their resistance to change and restructuring, just before the company is bought up by Air China or Aeroflot, now Russian millionaires are buying newspapers in France, and elsewhere.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,A menorah on Hanukkah two days before Christmas,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,3029,"['Do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'ceiling', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'sky', 'not', 'film', 'next', 'century', 'decade', 'not', 'even', 'comedy', 'present', 'decade', 'just', 'decent', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'sentimental', 'happy', 'highest', 'uppermost', 'acme', 'what', 'can', 'conceive', 'happy', 'ending', 'fact', 'structure', 'Shakespearian', 'very', 'detail', 'scene', 'model', 'here', 'are', 'even', 'nearly', 'modest', 'shy', 'happy', 'ending', 'Shakespeare', 'managed', 'have', 'four', 'marriages', 'end', 'play', 'will', 'do', 'again', 'end', 'A', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'Here', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'find', 'happy', 'ending', 'England', 'frankly', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'happen', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'country', 'fake', 'make-believe', 'real', 'stuff', 'can', 'only', 'happen', 'depth', 'Surrey', 'cow', 'back', 'garden', 'tent', 'girl', 'bedroom', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'slightly', 'ironically', 'critical', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'become', 'superficial', 'illusionary', 'virtual', 'reality', 'based', 'special', 'effects', 'canned', 'sentiments', 'roles', 'when', 'not', 'preserved', 'music', 'brain', 'elevator', 'even', 'British', 'may', 'call', 'lift', 'can', 'lift', 'fat', 'flesh', 'bones', 'will', 'never', 'lift', 'not', 'speak', 'elevating', 'artistic', 'musical', 'senses', 'prove', 'point', 'director', 'should', 'say', 'directress', 'be', 'accurate', 'even', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'can', 'not', 'use', 'word', 'directing', 'person', 'not', 'yet', 'succeeded', 'escalator-ize', 'up', 'tip', 'tongue', 'cameo', 'aging', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'appearing', 'aisles', 'DVD', 'store', 'background', 'Graduate', 'where', 'was', 'juicy', 'short', 'student', 'looking', 'way', 'lose', 'maidenhead', 'should', 'say', 'bachelor-head', 'legs', 'ripe', 'woman', 'Maybe', 'Hollywood', 'might', 'be', 'becoming', 'coming', 'decade', 'realistic', 'more', 'human', 'closer', 'real', 'life', 'probably', 'influence', 'competition', 'already', 'simmering', 'India', 'China', 'Asia', 'general', 'Europe', 'course', 'Europe', 'still', 'bogged', 'up', 'mud', 'tradition', 'cultural', 'protectionism', 'nothing', 'impotence', 'front', 'challenge', 'outside', 'funny', 'film', 'question', 'end', 'how', 'hell', 'are', 'going', 'fly', 'cow', 'London', 'Heathrow', 'Airport', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'International', 'Airport', 'guess', 'Air', 'France', 'will', 'volunteer', 'are', 'European', 'specialist', 'air-lift', 'kinds', 'cattle', 'two', 'strikes', 'when', 'passengers', 'are', 'treated', 'striking', 'personnel', 'samples', 'valueless', 'cattle', 'nothing', 'being', 'sent', 'local', 'slaughterhouse', 'get', 'way', 'resistance', 'change', 'restructuring', 'just', 'company', 'bought', 'up', 'Air', 'China', 'Aeroflot', 'now', 'Russian', 'millionaires', 'are', 'buying', 'newspapers', 'France', 'elsewhere.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Writer-Director Nancy Meyers, who made Something's Gotta Give, seems gifted at producing romance that has an edge of originality to it.  Her characters surprise us with their modernity -and diverge from searching for prince charming fluff.  The cast is exceptional - Kate Winslet is fantastic in perhaps one of her first uber-commercial roles.  Jude Law - well who couldn't stare at him for two hours, and he can act!  Jack Black tones down the mania and proves like so many talented comedians that he can really act in dramatic roles, and he is actually more palatable turned down a few notches.  Cameron Diaz sticks out in this crowd of talent by failing to fully deliver a believable character, and her character seems intended to be the most unconventional of the four.  It is hard to believe Jude Law, despite his sincere and dewy eyes, when he says to her ""you are the strangest girl I've ever met"", because Diaz is about as ""strange"" as LA-Barbie.  One can't help but think that the role deserved a quirky and lovable performance such as Winslet's in The Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.  Nevertheless we cheer for her to overcome her intimacy issues, and the film wraps up with a big red bow tied around it, and everyone spending New Years Eve in love.  The film gets bonus points for making fun of itself.

Honestly, Jack Black's face on the cover screamed: ""Not in a million years!"" Seriously, Jack Black, romantic comedy? Seriously, Jack Black - seriously? Well, there are four stars at the top of this review, so did Jack work? No, he didn't. I have a feeling that the filmmakers were aware of this as well because his screen time was  that of his other co-stars.Yet, this is a four-star review. So what worked?This is a difficult movie to compartmentalize. Per the story line, it should be split equally into two parts. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a movie-trailer producer who lives in LA and has broken up with her boyfriend. She's looking for an escape. Iris (Kate Winslet) is in love with someone she works with, yet he has just become engaged, much to her unfortunate surprise. She, as well, needs an escape and lists her cozy Surrey fairy-tale-like cottage on a home-exchange board. Amanda sees it, is intrigued, and they agree to an immediate swap. The very next day, in fact. This seems a bit pushed, considering the time difference between California and England, and the suddenness, especially on Amanda's part, but it's easily set aside.One would think that we have two stories. Yet we don't - at least, not in screen time. Granted, the movie is long (2:15), but it isn't until one hour and eleven minutes that anything of consequence happens for Iris in L.A. Prior to that, quite a bit has been going on in Surrey. Very oddly disjointed.Amanda is disturbed in the middle of the night (which for her would be dinnertime) by a loud pounding on the fairy-tale-cottage's door. It's Iris's brother, Graham, in what can only be called a spot-on Jude Law performance. Because of the quick swap, many things were forgotten, such as Iris's brother who often comes over to sleep off a good drunk if he spends too much time at the pub, and that Amanda has a boyfriend who will be sending people (Jack Black and his girlfriend) over to pick up his stuff.I'll sum it up: stuff happens between Amanda and Graham. Graham isn't quite the man he seems, and for once in the movies that's a good thing! There's a scene when Amanda surprisingly visits Graham at his house and they spend time in a, well, tent, that screams of the magic of Finding Neverland. Amanda and Graham have something together, and it's obvious to everyone. It must have been obvious to the filmmakers, because they seemed to grab a bit more than 2/3 of the total screen time.When we flip back to Iris in LA, it feels jolting, but Iris is growing as well. Iris, we know from observation, cries frequently. Amanda, we know from being told, hasn't cried since she was fifteen. There's some irony in that they have swapped houses. Perhaps the affect of Iris's presence will loosen up Amanda; perhaps Amanda will have a cooling influence on Iris.Sadly, only one of these plays through.Iris develops two special relationships in L.A. One is with a ninety-year old writer of many Hollywood screenplays. The other is with Miles (Jack Black). Guess which is more moving and believable?With Kate Winslet in the movie, it seems impossible to say this, but I will: if only she hadn't been in it. The filmmakers (I'm using this generally - who knows whose decision it was) chose to relegate her to a supporting role, when she should have shared the leading female role with Cameron Diaz (odd that her ninety-year-old friend, Arthur played well by Eli Wallach says nearly the same thing to her). Iris's L.A. story line could have been more believable, and it could have involved someone other than Jack Black. Let's keep him in Nacho Libre roles forever. He didn't belong here.But oh, how touching and moving it was when the film swept back to Surrey, to Amanda and Graham. This was their film. Both characters saw real, concrete and believable growth. For everything they brought to this film, it gets four stars from me - someone who was sure they would dislike the film going in.(Regarding the title of the review: I'm a guy.)",4,This is only a chick flick if you're not man enough to enjoy a good romantic comedy,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,4064,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'laugh', 'be', 'moved', 'occasional', 'tear', 'Honestly', 'Jack', 'Black', 'face', 'cover', 'screamed', 'Not', 'million', 'years', 'Seriously', 'Jack', 'Black', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Seriously', 'Jack', 'Black', 'seriously', 'Well', 'are', 'four', 'stars', 'top', 'review', 'so', 'did', 'Jack', 'work', 'No', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'aware', 'as', 'well', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'other', 'co-stars.Yet', 'four-star', 'review', 'what', 'worked', 'difficult', 'movie', 'compartmentalize', 'story', 'line', 'should', 'be', 'split', 'equally', 'two', 'parts', 'Amanda', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'movie-trailer', 'producer', 'who', 'LA', 'broken', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'looking', 'escape', 'Iris', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'love', 'someone', 'yet', 'just', 'become', 'engaged', 'much', 'unfortunate', 'surprise', 'as', 'well', 'escape', 'cozy', 'Surrey', 'fairy-tale-like', 'cottage', 'home-exchange', 'board', 'Amanda', 'intrigued', 'agree', 'immediate', 'swap', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'fact', 'bit', 'pushed', 'considering', 'time', 'difference', 'California', 'England', 'suddenness', 'especially', 'Amanda', 'part', 'easily', 'set', 'aside.One', 'would', 'think', 'have', 'two', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'least', 'not', 'screen', 'time', 'Granted', 'movie', 'long', '2:15', ""n't"", 'one', 'hour', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'anything', 'consequence', 'happens', 'Iris', 'L.A', 'Prior', 'quite', 'bit', 'been', 'going', 'Surrey', 'Very', 'oddly', 'disjointed.Amanda', 'disturbed', 'middle', 'night', 'would', 'be', 'dinnertime', 'loud', 'pounding', 'fairy-tale-cottage', 'door', 'Iris', 'brother', 'Graham', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'spot-on', 'Jude', 'Law', 'performance', 'quick', 'swap', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'forgotten', 'such', 'Iris', 'brother', 'who', 'often', 'sleep', 'off', 'good', 'drunk', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'pub', 'Amanda', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'sending', 'people', 'Jack', 'Black', 'girlfriend', 'pick', 'up', 'stuff.I', ""'ll"", 'sum', 'up', 'stuff', 'Amanda', 'Graham', 'Graham', ""n't"", 'quite', 'man', 'once', 'movies', 'good', 'thing', 'scene', 'when', 'Amanda', 'surprisingly', 'Graham', 'house', 'spend', 'time', 'well', 'tent', 'screams', 'magic', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Amanda', 'Graham', 'have', 'something', 'together', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'grab', 'bit', 'more', '2/3', 'total', 'screen', 'time.When', 'flip', 'back', 'Iris', 'LA', 'jolting', 'Iris', 'growing', 'as', 'well', 'Iris', 'know', 'observation', 'cries', 'frequently', 'Amanda', 'know', 'being', 'told', ""n't"", 'cried', 'was', 'fifteen', 'irony', 'have', 'swapped', 'houses', 'Perhaps', 'affect', 'Iris', 'presence', 'will', 'loosen', 'up', 'Amanda', 'perhaps', 'Amanda', 'will', 'have', 'cooling', 'influence', 'Iris.Sadly', 'only', 'one', 'plays', 'through.Iris', 'two', 'special', 'relationships', 'L.A.', 'One', 'ninety-year', 'old', 'writer', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'screenplays', 'other', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Guess', 'more', 'moving', 'believable', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'movie', 'impossible', 'say', 'will', 'only', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'filmmakers', ""'m"", 'using', 'generally', 'who', 'decision', 'was', 'chose', 'relegate', 'supporting', 'role', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'shared', 'leading', 'female', 'role', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'odd', 'ninety-year-old', 'friend', 'Arthur', 'played', 'well', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'nearly', 'same', 'thing', 'Iris', 'L.A.', 'story', 'line', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'could', 'have', 'involved', 'someone', 'other', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Let', 'keep', 'Nacho', 'Libre', 'forever', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'here.But', 'oh', 'how', 'touching', 'moving', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'swept', 'back', 'Surrey', 'Amanda', 'Graham', 'was', 'film', 'characters', 'saw', 'real', 'concrete', 'believable', 'growth', 'everything', 'brought', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'sure', 'would', 'dislike', 'film', 'going', 'Regarding', 'title', 'review', ""'m"", 'guy']",N/A

I can usually find something to bring home on Friday night to watch with the wife that we will both enjoy. So I thought that a film including Kate Winslet, Jack Black, Cameron Diaz, and Jude Law would be a great way to pass an evening on the couch.I was half right with this film, the half that deals with Kate, Jack, and Eli Wallach. This story ended up with more on the cutting room floor than the ""complicated"" Diaz-Law story line which is sad because it is the funniest and most endearing part.

I usually avoid this type of movie like the plague, though I'll freely admit there are a few that I've actually enjoyed over the years. The Holiday, my friends, is not one of them.This movie is bad even by ""chick flick"" standards. None of the characters are believable, the vast majority of their dialogue would never in a million years be uttered by sane human beings, and the whole storyline is both utterly unbelievable and utterly predictable. So many romantic comedy clich&eacute;s are trotted out that if you threw in some juvenile humor you'd have a parody to rival ""Date Movie"". The acting is as bad as the story. Cameron Diaz, in particular, takes bad acting to a whole new level, and don't even get me started on Jack Black. I went into this movie thinking ""sure it's a chick flick, but at least Hugh Grant's not in it. Besides, it's got Jack Black. How bad can it be?"" Black's character and performance are so lukewarm that God help me I might have preferred Hugh Grant.I was going to write off my reaction to the Holiday as the typical male response to the genre, but my wife hated it too, and she loves romantic comedies.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[1, 3]","When Los Angeles workaholic Amanda breaks up with her boyfriend, she needs a place where she can go and take her mind off things. At the same time, British newspaper journalist Iris realizes that she will never live happily ever after with the ex-boyfriend she's been pining after for three years. The two decide to swap lives, in effect, and each live in the other's home for two weeks.In the beginning, Amanda thinks she's made a mistake and books herself a flight back to La La Land. Then enters Iris's charming older brother, Graham, who sweeps Amanda off her feet in what she expects to be a one-night stand but turns out to be much more. Iris, on the other hand, has a great time in Los Angeles from the very beginning and makes friends with an elderly screenwriter who is Amanda's neighbor. Their friendship forms the foundation that allows her to forget about her ex and move on with her life.The Holiday is, as other reviewers have noted, two romantic comedies in one. Cameron Diaz is endearingly neurotic as the workaholic Amanda who is so busy running a successful business she doesn't have time to have sex with her boyfriend. When she meets Graham and finally allows herself to let her guard down, it was a perfect romantic comedy moment complete with the complicated plot twist (which I won't give away, but let's just say Graham's been keeping secrets). Similarly, Iris lets herself be walked on by the object of her affection for so long that she forgets that she does deserve to be loved back by someone who will appreciate her. The relationship that she forms with Amanda's neighbor gives her the gumption to finally stand up for herself and stop being a doormat. This movie was a cute and funny romantic comedy, and my only complaint is that--at over 2 hours--it was a bit longer than I expected or was necessary. Other than that, it was enjoyable and entertaining.Also, I originally thought The Holiday must have been based on the Jane Green novel Swapping Lives, which has a similar home exchange between a Brit and an American, but since the two were released within six months of each other, I guess that's not the case. Still, if you enjoy this film, you might want to check out Swapping Lives for a different perspective on the same story.",3,"Cute and funny, but a bit long for my taste",1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,2264,"['When', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'workaholic', 'Amanda', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'take', 'mind', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'British', 'newspaper', 'journalist', 'Iris', 'will', 'never', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'ex-boyfriend', 'been', 'pining', 'three', 'years', 'two', 'decide', 'swap', 'lives', 'effect', 'live', 'other', 'home', 'two', 'weeks.In', 'beginning', 'Amanda', 'made', 'mistake', 'books', 'flight', 'back', 'La', 'La', 'Land', 'Then', 'Iris', 'charming', 'older', 'brother', 'Graham', 'who', 'Amanda', 'feet', 'what', 'be', 'one-night', 'stand', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'Iris', 'other', 'hand', 'great', 'time', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'very', 'beginning', 'friends', 'elderly', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'Amanda', 'neighbor', 'friendship', 'foundation', 'forget', 'ex', 'move', 'life.The', 'Holiday', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'two', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'one', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'endearingly', 'neurotic', 'workaholic', 'Amanda', 'who', 'so', 'busy', 'running', 'successful', 'business', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'have', 'sex', 'boyfriend', 'When', 'Graham', 'finally', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'was', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'moment', 'complete', 'complicated', 'plot', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Graham', 'been', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'Similarly', 'Iris', 'be', 'walked', 'object', 'affection', 'so', 'long', 'deserve', 'be', 'loved', 'back', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'appreciate', 'relationship', 'Amanda', 'neighbor', 'gumption', 'finally', 'stand', 'up', 'herself', 'stop', 'being', 'doormat', 'movie', 'was', 'cute', 'funny', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'only', 'complaint', '2', 'hours', 'was', 'bit', 'longer', 'expected', 'was', 'necessary', 'Other', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining.Also', 'originally', 'thought', 'Holiday', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'Jane', 'Green', 'novel', 'Swapping', 'Lives', 'similar', 'home', 'exchange', 'Brit', 'American', 'two', 'were', 'released', 'six', 'months', 'other', 'guess', 'not', 'case', 'Still', 'enjoy', 'film', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Swapping', 'Lives', 'different', 'perspective', 'same', 'story']",N/A

Both ladies are miserable and decide to get away from home for Christmas.  They find each other on an online house-switch site and before you can say ""I know how this is going to end!"" Amanda is living in a cozy English cottage and Iris is ensconced in a luxurious LA mansion.  And you'll never guess what happens next.  (Okay, you will guess - in about half a minute.)Diaz, Winslet, and co-stars Jude Law and Jack Black are all fine here, looking beautiful and clever and giving sincere performances.  It's not their fault that the script is so predictable and corny with no room for WHY these new loves blossom so quickly, so blissfully, and so conveniently, considering the women are emotionally wounded and would need some time to heal and the men are not looking for relationships.  And what exactly are the odds of meeting your dream mate within hours of moving to a foreign country?  Eli Wallach gives a winning performance as a doddering old scriptwriter befriended by Iris, but again, it's all too perfect; there's no question that they will become instant buddies and that their lives will both be enriched by their friendship.If I were a woman in the 18-26 target group, I'd probably love this movie and even shed a few tears at it; as it is, I just kept thinking, ""Well, there's five hours of my life I'll never get back.""

1049226,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000MQC9H4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","Three things I think after having watched, ""The Holiday.""  The first is that Eli Wallach stole this romantic comedy.  He plays Arthur Abbott, who in his younger days was an Oscar winning screenwriter and who is now a neighbor of Iris (Kate Winslet) now that the young English woman is living in the Hollywood mansion of Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who is now living in the little English cottage of Iris in Surrey.  The two women have swapped homes this particular Christmas because Iris has discovered her ex-boyfriend is getting married and Amanda just needs to get away from her job making movie trailers.  Since it is a romantic comedy both of the women meet men, with Amanda running into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law), and Iris meeting Miles (Jack Black), a composer.  The problem is that the most interesting and endearing relationship in the film is between Iris and Arthur.  Jack Black is trying to play things straight here, something he had proven he can do already in ""Shallow Hall"" (when he discovers why Cadence is in the hospital), but he is totally wasted in this movie, even if Wallach is not stealing every scene he is in without breaking a sweat.The second thing I am thinking is that there is a reason why Kate Winslet is the youngest actress to have earned five Oscar nominations for her work.  I am not saying that this performance is worth of a nomination, but every time we had a scene of Cameron Diaz working so hard to act it was refreshing to get back to Winslet showing how it should be done.  Again, the sparks between her and Wallach are the highpoint of this film.  The third thing on my list is that they did not take advantage of the running gag of Amanda picturing a trailer of her sad and pathetic love life in her own mind.  Actually, all we usually get to hear is the familiar voice of Hal Douglas narrating the trailer, but I think there was a whole lot more mileage to get out of the idea (e.g., showing the same scenes but giving them totally different spins by changing the music and the voiceovers).Finally, and most importantly in terms of my ultimate evaluation of this film, I think that this film lacks a key requirement of most romances, which is the grand gesture.  Actually, it needs two grand gestures given that there are two romances trying to flower here.  Now the label of grand gesture is somewhat hyperbolic, because sometimes the boy can get the girl at""hello""or notsay anythingand just stand with a boom box playing the right song.  But I think there should be something both unique and significant that somebody does to get the person they love.  Think of your favorite romantic comedies and I bet you can think of the grand gesture, the pivotal romantic moment, in each.  In ""Love Actually"" there are at least three of them, and what passes for one in ""The Holiday"" has to do with (surprise, surprise) Iris and Arthur.  Watching this film was enjoyable enough, but they basically fast forward to the requisite happy ending without making these characters even try to earn our tears and I am rounding up on this only because of the scenes between Wallach and Winslet.",4,"Forget about Diaz, Law and Black because ""The Holiday"" comes down to Winslet and Wallach",1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,3122,"['Three', 'things', 'think', 'having', 'watched', 'Holiday', 'first', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'stole', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Arthur', 'Abbott', 'who', 'younger', 'days', 'was', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'now', 'neighbor', 'Iris', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'now', 'young', 'English', 'woman', 'living', 'Hollywood', 'mansion', 'Amanda', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', 'now', 'living', 'little', 'English', 'cottage', 'Iris', 'Surrey', 'two', 'women', 'have', 'swapped', 'homes', 'particular', 'Christmas', 'Iris', 'discovered', 'ex-boyfriend', 'getting', 'married', 'Amanda', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'job', 'making', 'movie', 'trailers', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'women', 'meet', 'men', 'Amanda', 'running', 'Iris', 'brother', 'Graham', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Iris', 'meeting', 'Miles', 'Jack', 'Black', 'composer', 'problem', 'most', 'interesting', 'endearing', 'relationship', 'film', 'Iris', 'Arthur', 'Jack', 'Black', 'trying', 'play', 'things', 'straight', 'here', 'something', 'had', 'proven', 'can', 'do', 'already', 'Shallow', 'Hall', 'when', 'why', 'Cadence', 'hospital', 'totally', 'wasted', 'movie', 'even', 'Wallach', 'not', 'stealing', 'scene', 'breaking', 'sweat.The', 'second', 'thing', 'am', 'thinking', 'reason', 'why', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'youngest', 'actress', 'have', 'earned', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'work', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'performance', 'nomination', 'time', 'had', 'scene', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'working', 'so', 'hard', 'act', 'was', 'refreshing', 'get', 'back', 'Winslet', 'showing', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'Again', 'sparks', 'Wallach', 'are', 'highpoint', 'film', 'third', 'thing', 'list', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'advantage', 'running', 'gag', 'Amanda', 'picturing', 'trailer', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'love', 'life', 'own', 'mind', 'Actually', 'usually', 'get', 'hear', 'familiar', 'voice', 'Hal', 'Douglas', 'narrating', 'trailer', 'think', 'was', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'mileage', 'get', 'idea', 'e.g.', 'showing', 'same', 'scenes', 'giving', 'totally', 'different', 'spins', 'changing', 'music', 'voiceovers', '.Finally', 'most', 'importantly', 'terms', 'ultimate', 'evaluation', 'film', 'think', 'film', 'key', 'requirement', 'most', 'romances', 'grand', 'gesture', 'Actually', 'two', 'grand', 'gestures', 'given', 'are', 'two', 'romances', 'trying', 'flower', 'here', 'Now', 'label', 'grand', 'gesture', 'somewhat', 'hyperbolic', 'sometimes', 'boy', 'can', 'get', 'girl', 'hello', 'notsay', 'anythingand', 'just', 'stand', 'boom', 'box', 'playing', 'right', 'song', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'unique', 'significant', 'somebody', 'get', 'person', 'love', 'Think', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'bet', 'can', 'think', 'grand', 'gesture', 'pivotal', 'romantic', 'moment', 'Love', 'Actually', 'are', 'least', 'three', 'what', 'one', 'Holiday', 'do', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'Iris', 'Arthur', 'Watching', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'basically', 'fast', 'forward', 'requisite', 'happy', 'ending', 'making', 'characters', 'even', 'try', 'earn', 'tears', 'am', 'rounding', 'up', 'only', 'scenes', 'Wallach', 'Winslet']",N/A

1049229,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000MQC9H4,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 5]","""The Holiday"" put a smile on my face.  It is a heartwarming romantic film that winds up being a blast of good cheer for the holidays.  Director Nancy Meyers has one Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay forPrivate Benjamin (Full Screen Edition)and didSomething's Gotta Givewith Diane Keaton & Jack Nicholson andWhat Women Wantwith Helen Hunt & Mel Gibson.  She hits the right chords in this romantic genre again.Kate Winslet who was once nominated for a picture titled ""Iris"" plays the character Iris.  Winslet is an interesting actress who has been nominated for 27 various film awards including 5 Oscars and has only won two smaller awards as Best Supporting Actress for ""Iris"" by the L.A. Film Critics and for ""Sense & Sensibility"" by the Screen Actors Guild.  While I think my favorite film performance of hers was in ""Finding Neverland,"" I found it interesting in the DVD extras her comments on how pleased she was to try comedy.  The scene with the split phone call where she has Diaz and Law on the other ends & keeps connecting with the wrong one is hilarious.  She does a charming job throughout the film.Jack Black plays ""Miles.""  I think I will always think of him as the guy who Bruce Willis blows his arm off inThe Jackal - Collector's Edition.  Seeing him as an offbeat romantic lead was not as great a thrill as seeing him spurt blood and run mindlessly around a meadow.  But hopefully even guys who don't look like Jude Law will be inspired to one day find their true love.  As a film music composer, Black was most interesting in Blockbuster where he knew the scores to random movies.Cameron Diaz has a smile that is as wide as the state of North Carolina.  From her films like ""There's Something About Mary,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Vanilla Sky"" & ""Gangs of New York,"" she's shown her ability to fit in a wide number of film genres.  She captures our attention as Amanda who heads off to England after breaking up with Ed Burns' character.Jude Law is impressive as an actor.  He fits into the romantic comedy genre effortlessly as Graham who is a young widowed father with two small children.  The girls who play his kids Sophie and Olivia are darling.  I'm not sure if he clicks as deeply as he did as Inman with Nicole Kidman in ""Cold Mountain,"" but we feel a connection and hope the lovers get together.  (One recent high school graduate who watched the film with me commented that Jude Law & Johnny Depp are God's gift to women.  ...I smiled...)Eli Wallach who was over 90 years old when this was filmed plays Arthur, a screenwriter who Iris connects with while on holiday.  Rufus Sewell fromHelen of Troyplays Jasper who breaks Iris' heart & tries to keep her on a string.I found it interesting that all of these characters worked for the media from a film trailer editor to a music score composer to a screenwriter to a book editor to a newspaper writer.  While we might have had a variety of occupations like a plumber, a piano tuner or a construction contractor, the similarity of occupation was not a major distraction.I found the interplay between Los Angeles & England to be a delight.  A good love story may not differ that much in its essentials from story to story, but this one is done with great style & lifted my spirits.  I hope it does your too.

Iris (Winslet) is in love with a man who is about to marry another woman. Across the globe, Amanda (Diaz), realizes the man she lives with has been unfaithful. Two women who have never met and live 6000 miles apart, find themselves in the exact same place. They meet online at a home exchange website and impulsively switch homes for the holiday. Iris moves into Amanda's L.A. house in sunny California as Amanda arrives in the snow covered English countryside. Shortly after arriving at their destinations, both women find the last thing either wants or expects: a new romance. Amanda is charmed by Iris' handsome brother Graham (Law) and Iris, with inspiration provided by legendary screenwriter Arthur (Wallach), mends her heart when she meets film composer Miles (Black).Special FeaturesCommentary by writer/director Nancy Meyers and guests""Foreign Exchange: The Making of The Holiday"" featuretteProduct DetailsActors: Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Jack Black, Eli WallachDirectors: Nancy MeyersWriters: Nancy MeyersProducers: Nancy Meyers, Bruce A.

In short, a perfect holiday movie.In terms of a plot, there's not much there- two women find themselves flailing during the holidays and swap homes in hope of a bit of a change of scene and a break from the crazy. Jack Black is surprisingly honest and likable as Miles the composer. Kate Winslet is, in my opinion, a truly versatile actress who brings a light touch to her role as Iris- an Everygal with guy issues- who Winslet makes so charming and appealing you really wish you knew her in real life. Better yet, when she finally womans up you're rooting for her rather than rolling your eyes and saying ""FINALLY!"" Cameron Diaz is fun as always- once again proving that her comedic instincts are spot on. I think she worked well with Jude Law, who is just fantastic as Graham- sweet, sensitive and beguiling, and if you can resist those eyes you've got to be made of stone.There are a few bits that are a little too reminiscent of the talky 70's movies in which characters angst and moan about relationships and drek (there's a scene with Law and Diaz talking about their relationship in bed after sex that made me want to poke my eye out with a fork) but overall it's great fun.

1049233,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B000MQC9H4,lily t.,"[0, 0]","I'm always on the lookout for a quality chick flick and assumed from the great cast that this might be, if not one of the greats , a pretty good runner up. Sadly I was disappointed, although I still found it enjoyable mainly because of the LA story line with Kate Winslet.Winslet plays Iris, an English reporter, who suffering from a broken heart, exchanges houses with movie trailer producer Amanda [ Cameron Diaz] for two weeks, trading in her English cottage for a spectacular house in L.A.  Iris is an intelligent, beautiful and kind woman who for whatever reason is a doormat and doesn't see herself in the best light. I suspect because she is supposedly full figured she is initially romantically disappointed and then paired with Jack Black, playing a chunky good guy taken advantage of by a skinny girlfriend.Cameron Diaz, on the other hand by virtue of her thinness and super blond hair  hooks up with the likes of handsome Jude Law [and in this tale, his looks are the least of his virtues] in a preposterous story line. Her character, though supposedly independent and mega successful, is written as an American ditz, and when she burbles and chortles completely inane nonsense to Jude Law, he looks as if he is about gag before delivering the line, 'I've never met anyone like you.' I never doubted it.In any case when the movie is in LA  the script is good, though a bit low key as Iris establishes a lovely friendship with a  legendary nonagerian screenwriter Arthur [ Eli Wallach], who helps her regain her confidence by recommending she watch movies from the golden age of women's films, starring the likes of Barbara Stanwyck and Irene Dunne. Meanwhile in Surrey, getting more screen time, Diaz and Law have sex, prance around the countryside,and dine out  while Diaz tries to get in touch with her inner feelings and emote, overacting all the way.Unless you are a fan of the actors or Nancy Meyers, I would recommend  following Arthur's advice and watching some of those oldies but goodies instead.",3,Enjoyable if you have nothing better going on,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,2016,"[""'m"", 'always', 'lookout', 'quality', 'chick', 'flick', 'assumed', 'great', 'cast', 'might', 'be', 'not', 'one', 'greats', 'pretty', 'good', 'runner', 'up', 'Sadly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'still', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'mainly', 'LA', 'story', 'line', 'Kate', 'Winslet.Winslet', 'Iris', 'English', 'reporter', 'who', 'suffering', 'broken', 'heart', 'exchanges', 'houses', 'movie', 'trailer', 'producer', 'Amanda', '[', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', ']', 'two', 'weeks', 'trading', 'English', 'cottage', 'spectacular', 'house', 'L.A.', 'Iris', 'intelligent', 'beautiful', 'kind', 'woman', 'who', 'reason', 'doormat', ""n't"", 'see', 'best', 'light', 'suspect', 'supposedly', 'full', 'figured', 'initially', 'romantically', 'disappointed', 'then', 'paired', 'Jack', 'Black', 'playing', 'chunky', 'good', 'guy', 'taken', 'advantage', 'skinny', 'girlfriend.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'other', 'hand', 'virtue', 'thinness', 'super', 'blond', 'hair', 'up', 'likes', 'handsome', 'Jude', 'Law', '[', 'tale', 'looks', 'are', 'least', 'virtues', ']', 'preposterous', 'story', 'line', 'character', 'though', 'supposedly', 'independent', 'mega', 'successful', 'written', 'American', 'ditz', 'when', 'chortles', 'completely', 'inane', 'nonsense', 'Jude', 'Law', 'gag', 'delivering', 'line', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'anyone', 'never', 'doubted', 'it.In', 'case', 'when', 'movie', 'LA', 'script', 'good', 'bit', 'low', 'key', 'Iris', 'lovely', 'friendship', 'legendary', 'nonagerian', 'screenwriter', 'Arthur', '[', 'Eli', 'Wallach', ']', 'who', 'regain', 'confidence', 'recommending', 'watch', 'movies', 'golden', 'age', 'women', 'films', 'starring', 'likes', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Meanwhile', 'Surrey', 'getting', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Diaz', 'Law', 'have', 'sex', 'prance', 'countryside', 'dine', 'out', 'Diaz', 'tries', 'get', 'touch', 'inner', 'feelings', 'emote', 'overacting', 'way.Unless', 'are', 'fan', 'actors', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'would', 'recommend', 'following', 'Arthur', 'advice', 'watching', 'oldies', 'goodies', 'instead']",N/A

Kate Winslet is Iris, a society columnist at a London newspaper, of modest means and plain appearance (not that Winslet could be anything but handsome; but her hair style was deliberately unbecoming).  Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a Type A producer of movie trailers in L.A. who makes loads of money, lives in a multi-million dollar house, and dresses to the nines.  Of course Amanda couldn't possibly have fit all those clothes in the bag we see her dragging down the road to Iris's house (they were gorgeous, though).  Iris is really on holiday, ecstatic over the swimming pool and huge dvd library, while Amanda is too much of a racehorse to calm down in Iris's quaint little stone cottage at first.Jude Law was sweet as Graham, Iris's brother who knocked on her (now Amanda's) door to use the loo late one night, and found love.  Didn't care for the way he and Diaz were directed.  Even Law overacted in spots.  Jack Black was actually pretty good as Iris's love interest Miles--when he remembered to act.  I've never much cared for his shtick, but his likableness is undeniable. If he would just learn to control his eyebrows.The two actors I couldn't take my eyes from were Winslet, and Eli Wallach who played the ninety-year-old former Hollywood screenwriter living next door.  Not that these were Academy Award caliber parts, far from it.  But you could just see the quality these actors brought with them.  They couldn't help it.  Gemstones glowing amongst the costume jewelry.It's a fairy tale.  Introduced with a voiceover by Winslet in a sad-sweet soliloquy on love at the year's ebbing, it ends with four very nice people loving the ones who deserve them, at the start of a hopeful New Year.  Fairy tales are always pat; that's why we love them.

Because while the overall quality of The Holiday is so low, it's also quite enjoyable.The movie boasts a stellar cast: Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, and Jack Black. One might think that it's worth seeing the movie just to see these people all on the screen together. And they wouldn't be completely wrong, either. However, though they are very close together on the cover, in reality, they are in completely different parts of the world; the respective couples, that is.I personally much more enjoyed the Kate Winslet/Jack Black relationship. Though an odd pairing, they turned out to be perfect foils for each other. Kate Winslet even had a cute sub-plot with this old Jewish writer guy. I wasn't as big of a fan of the Cameron Diaz/Jude Law pairing. They never really lit up the screen in my opinion. And Cameron Diaz singing ""Mr. Brightside"" randomly during the movie was painful and unnessecary. I've never been a huge Cameron Diaz fan.The premise is completely and utterly impossible and ludicrous. You will have to get past the silliness of it all to just enjoy the movie. Also, the movie is strictly a ""chick flick"", for lack of a better phrase. So don't get it expecting anything else.

1049247,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000MQC9H4,Marc Cabir Davis,"[73, 83]","I don't think this decade has had much success with romantic comedies, but trust me that with ""The Holiday"", the 2000s have never looked better. I consider this film to be one that extracts the finest performances from Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz EVER, and once you see it, you will know what I mean.Kate Winslet has acted in many good movies (""Hideous Kinky"", ""Holy Smoke"", ""Iris"") but its ironic that her most poignant and well-written role comes in ""The Holiday"". You probably know the story already - its about two women on two different continents who swap houses and lives after a chance meeting on the Internet - but the treatment and above all, the DIALOGUE, is what drives this romantic comedy to the heights of that most rare animal - a cinema classic.And thats what ""The Holiday"" is. I honestly think that a genuine, feel-good film such as this should be embraced by the Oscar group, instead of their focus on typical epic films such as ""Babel"" and ""Gladiator"". This is where the magic is. Cameron Diaz especially, has never found a better vehicle for her goofy charm (yes, this is even better - staggeringly better than ""There's Something About Mary""). Jude Law, who has had his share of incredible dramatic performances in films such as ""Wilde"" and ""Alfie"", uses his effortless charm and natural screen presence to radiate such magnetism, that he is undeniably the most spot-on best romantic lead you would have seen for a while.Audiences I saw this with claimed that ""The Holiday"" was at least twice as better than ""Pretty Woman"". No comparison. The films I consider really good romantic comedies would be ""Never Been Kissed"", ""A Life Less Ordinary"" and ""Theres Something About Mary"". However, ""The Holiday"" is all that, but the amazing thing is that it has a heart of gold and does NOT rely upon slapstick humor to make the dialogue and situations work.Kate Winslets' character in fact, is one worth coming back to and studying, even from a film students' perspective. She infuses her role with so much wit and warmth, that we do not mind if this girl even ends up single in the movie - we just want her to find herself. The scene where she dumps her boyfriend after three years of emotional abuse is absolutely wondrous - the actress glows and gives off such electric spark that its impossible not to FEEL for this beautiful character.Jack Black, in a superb cinematic role as a Hollywood music industry biggie, is never meant to be taken seriously as a love interest for Kate, much as some would like to think so. Their sad tale is of two people in two different bad relationships finding a friend again - I loved how the end of this movie did not strive to hurriedly bring two people together - rather, it allows space for the characters to breathe and live their emotions, which is why its so easy to take this film seriously, and which is why you MUST watch it.Finally a film worth buying! I have waited so long for a movie of such depth, grace and respect for the art of film-making.There are so many amazing scenes here - Kate in her quaint cottage trying to commit suicide (a poignant moment filled with humor and grief all at the same time), Kate waking up in the lap of luxury in Los Angeles, the initial meeting between Cameron and Jude and their wondrous chemistry, the moment where they realize they are in love with each other, the moment where Cameron meets Jude's kids, and her ultimate realization that her selfish, unloving persona has been undone by this mans' love - and the scene where she leaves it all behind to run back to the person she loves the most. There are SO many such moments during this movie. Consider this a return to form for Hollywood in general.I would especially like to thank the makers of ""The Holiday"". I don't know if any of them read Amazon reviews, but as a critic of film, I find it so hard to like so many of the ""serious"" films out there today. Most of them are made to win Oscars, and then there are those tailormade to win Academy Awards. Either way, they're made to win something. And then you have the disposable comedies of the ""Scary Movie"" variety. But a film such as this makes me realize that the glory days of the 1950s and 60s of Hollywood still exist.I must also state here that I only saw this film because I saw that it starred Kate Winslet. This is one actress that has never let me down throughout her amazing career - and to find that she gave her best ever performance in this film made me all the more happier. She takes a beaten down, funnily written character and transforms her into a woman of great intelligence and feeling - this is NOT Bridget Jones' Diary!Which is why its obvious why these stars signed up for a movie such as this. On the face of it, ""The Holiday"" is a two-story arc that converges into one in the end - about the love lives of two very different women. But it is so much more than that - in fact, it is a meditation on love and hope in this day and age.If my praise seems extravagant, all I can say is, buy this. Do not rent it, buy it. It is the pinnacle of working excellence for all three major stars - Jude, Kate and Cameron, and it is by far the best romantic comedy of the 2000s by a long shot.

That fact tells me that sometimes critics aren't able to perceive a good movie, perhaps because they've gotten so jaded from seeing so many of them.I for one really enjoyed the film.  Ever since seeing Kate Winslet in ""Enigma"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" I've pretty much adored her.  Her portrayal of lovelorn Iris in ""the Holiday"" was spot on.  I particularly liked the scene where she expressed such unexpected joy at discovering she was going to spend her vacation in a luxurious Los Angeles mansion.I also felt the other three leads, Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, and Jack Black did very well in their respective roles.  I initially thought that the romance between Diaz and Law was a bit contrived, but in the end the film sold it.  And while I could predict most of the twists and turns of the film, it managed to surprise me with a couple about that romance.As for Jack Black, casting him as a match for Kate Winslet worked for me because while he is a talented comic and a developing actor, he's a pretty average guy (gives hope to us guys in the real world), and I liked the idea that he wound up with someone as so appealing and enticing as Kate Winslet.As for Eli Wallach, while he didn't get as much screen time as the four leads, I think he pulled off playing a charming and cranky ""father figure"" for Winslet's Iris.  And while some might dismiss his advice to her that she needs to be a ""leading lady in her own life"" as trite, it's still good advice.My only criticism of the film was at the very beginning where Cameron Diaz punches her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend twice in the face.  The audience laughed, but I always find myself thinking that no one would be laughing if the boyfriend character slugged Diaz.  But it's a minor fault to a great movie.A final criticism made by some of the critics that needs to be rebutted is the one that the story in England was ""stronger"" than the one in Los Angeles.  My response is that the relationship dynamics were totally different, hence the plotlines were different.  Winslet and Black's characters were essentially getting over bad relationships that had left them pretty hurt.  Conversely, Diaz's character was someone who had fallen out of love with her aformentioned boyfriend and was more open to a conventional romance.So I'd say, ignore what any negative reviews may say, and go and see the movie.  As for myself, I know I will add it to my collection, and since I am pretty tired of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this will be a film I watch around Christmas again and again.",5,An Unexpected Christmas Treat,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2658,"['Holiday', 'be', 'getting', 'average', 'reviews', 'least', 'when', 'checked', 'Movie', 'Review', 'Query', 'Engine', 'fact', 'critics', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'perceive', 'good', 'movie', 'perhaps', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'so', 'jaded', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'them.I', 'one', 'really', 'film', 'Ever', 'seeing', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Enigma', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'adored', 'portrayal', 'lovelorn', 'Iris', 'Holiday', 'was', 'spot', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'expressed', 'such', 'unexpected', 'joy', 'discovering', 'was', 'going', 'spend', 'vacation', 'luxurious', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'mansion.I', 'also', 'felt', 'other', 'three', 'leads', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Jack', 'Black', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'respective', 'roles', 'initially', 'thought', 'romance', 'Diaz', 'Law', 'was', 'bit', 'contrived', 'end', 'film', 'sold', 'could', 'predict', 'most', 'twists', 'turns', 'film', 'managed', 'surprise', 'couple', 'romance.As', 'Jack', 'Black', 'casting', 'match', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'worked', 'talented', 'comic', 'developing', 'actor', 'pretty', 'average', 'guy', 'hope', 'guys', 'real', 'world', 'liked', 'idea', 'wound', 'up', 'someone', 'so', 'appealing', 'enticing', 'Kate', 'Winslet.As', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'four', 'leads', 'think', 'pulled', 'off', 'playing', 'charming', 'cranky', 'father', 'figure', 'Winslet', 'Iris', 'might', 'dismiss', 'advice', 'be', 'leading', 'lady', 'own', 'life', 'trite', 'still', 'good', 'advice.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'beginning', 'where', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'soon-to-be', 'ex-boyfriend', 'twice', 'face', 'audience', 'laughed', 'always', 'find', 'thinking', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'laughing', 'boyfriend', 'character', 'slugged', 'Diaz', 'minor', 'fault', 'great', 'movie.A', 'final', 'criticism', 'made', 'critics', 'be', 'rebutted', 'one', 'story', 'England', 'was', 'stronger', 'one', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'response', 'relationship', 'dynamics', 'were', 'totally', 'different', 'hence', 'plotlines', 'were', 'different', 'Winslet', 'Black', 'characters', 'were', 'essentially', 'getting', 'bad', 'relationships', 'had', 'left', 'pretty', 'hurt', 'Conversely', 'Diaz', 'character', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'aformentioned', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'more', 'open', 'conventional', 'romance.So', ""'d"", 'say', 'ignore', 'what', 'negative', 'reviews', 'may', 'say', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'know', 'will', 'add', 'collection', 'am', 'pretty', 'tired', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'watch', 'around', 'Christmas', 'again', 'again']",N/A

If you enjoy a heartwarming, romantic comedy, you will love this movie. If you have wondered what could happen if you just picked up and basically exchanged your life with a stranger, then you will also love this movie. It is definitely a 'chick flick'.  My husband bemoaned the fact that no one was killed, there was nothing blown up, etc. I found the movie captivating and found myself smiling a lot as sweet moments occured.This is a story of two women who are having love life and personal problems.  They find one another through Home Exchange and within a day, they have left their troubles behind and journeyed to new lands. Kate Winslett, who has very little self-respect, finds a bushel! Her outgoing personality attracts those around her and while she is helping others, in the end she helps herself to become stronger.Cameron Diaz is a powerful, wealthy woman who is emotionally blocked. Her journey into love finds her overcoming past sorrows and learning that loving and taking chances can be very rewarding.Jack Black and Jude Law melted my heart with their smiles.

Amanda and Iris connect via a housing-swap Web site and agree to switch houses for two weeks in order to escape during the holidays. Amanda heads to England, where she is immediately swept off her feet by Iris's charming brother, Graham (Jude Law). Meanwhile, Iris arrives in L.A. and is blown away by Amanda's posh lifestyle. She befriends an elderly neighbor (Eli Wallach) who is a retired Hollywood screenwriter, and ultimately finds an unexpected new love interest in Miles (Jack Black), a film composer.This is a fun little movie. I enjoyed the Amanda/Graham scenes most of all. Diaz and Law have excellent chemistry and make a great on-screen pair. I am a huge fan on Winslet and she did a great job in the film as well, but the scenes with her really dragged on a bit in the beginning. There were too many scenes where Iris was just sitting around lamenting about her cad of an ex-boyfriend. My other major beef with this film is that I do not understand why Jack Black is in it. Was no one else available? I have no problem with Black, but this just isn't his type of role, and there was absolutely no romantic spark of any kind between him and Winslet.In spite of its few flaws, I still enjoyed ""The Holiday"" very much.

Moore,"[153, 160]","Nancy Meyers' ""The Holiday"" has been seriously dissed by most of America's film critics--including one who suggested that any man who goes to see it should be forced to pay with a crucial part of his anatomy instead of money. ""The Holiday"" is indeed a prime example of what is condecendingly known as a ""chick flick,"" and it's not a movie you can make great claims for. But ""The Holiday"" succeeds outstandingly in living up to its title; it provides an audience with a two-hour vacation filled with charming, likable actors playing charming, likable characters. The movie is set during the Christmas holidays in which two women with man problems--Iris (Kate Winslet), an English journalist, and Amanda (Cameron Diaz), an L.A. producer of film trailers--meet over the Internet. On a whim, they decide to switch houses for Christmas; Amanda ends up in Iris's picture-postcard-pretty cottage in Surrey, Iris in Amanda's luxurious, gated mansion in Beverly Hills. There, they discover new romantic complications: Amanda with Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and Iris with a film composer named Miles (Jack Black). There's also a subplot about the friendship that develops between Iris and an elderly screenwriter played by the venerable Eli Wallach. Nothing that happens in the movie is at all original or consequential. I could even quibble about an inaccuracy or two in Meyers' screenplay (Cary Grant was from Bristol in Gloucestershire, not Surrey). But seeing ""The Holiday"" makes you feel happy and light of heart, which is all it sets out to do. While the film's appeal is necessarily greater for women, I also think most men will find this a more-than-serviceable date movie. Sometimes you want a movie that's rich, gooey and sweet, that contains no sharp edges and requires no sharp utensils for its consumption.

No doubt, the main premise of the film involves the ups and downs of being in relationships.  Kate Winslet (Iris Simpkins) and Cameron Diaz (Amanda Woods) star in the movie along with Jude Law (Graham) and Jack Black (Miles).  The film has two major storylines, but the majority of the film intermingles Iris and Amanda's personal predicaments, that emphasize the meaning of friendship and the pleasure of being in the presence of great company.The film runs a little over two hours with much detail.  The movie takes viewers on a transcontinental trip that crosses from the picturesque and almost Thomas Kinkade-like wintry English village scene where Iris resides to Amanda's posh Beverly Hills surroundings.  The women decide to exchange living quarters in order to heal from dysfunctional relationships.  But the comic relief comes from Amanda's character who never seems to escape from her job as a movie trailer producer because throughout her uncompromising situations, she worries too much and her worries play out like movie trailers.  The only odd part of the film involves the storyline, which involves Iris befriending retired screenwriter, Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach).  Nevertheless, the surprising and touching part of the film comes at the end with Jude Law's character.The Holiday is one of those films to sit back and relax to.

Cinema like The Holiday, ballet, symphony, libraries, museums provide sanctuary, a generosity of time, comfort, conversation, quiet, support. Also Hannukah beef brisket and macaroon leftovers if you're lucky.The Holiday, alluding to every major film, film-maker, writer, production designer, costume designer, actor, music (You are lovely: Jude Law channeling Jerome Kern's The Way You Look Tonight), dance of the Golden Age of Film, is an affectionate romantic musical comedy honoring the gold mine of film history.Ninety year old Eli Wallach represents the dignified elder statesman of film playing himself.DeparturesThe editing of Holiday is so crisp that momentary allusions to films past are condensed into easily missed seconds (Dustin Hoffman playing himself referencing The Graduate, Lindsay Lohan The Parent Trap).Jude Law plays a single dad of two girls in UK, Cameron Diaz a type A, multitasking LA career woman, Kate Winslet a gumptionless writer editor suffering unrequited love, and Jack Black a kind, decent cuckholded music composer. Sharing their pain allows them to escape loneliness and discover that courageously facing vulnerabilities and fears with friends somehow makes reality more tolerable.The settings, Surrey and LA contrast small village to large city, homey decency to minimalism, Art Moderne to Art Deco, home cooking to restaurants, courageous honesty to problematical pairing, multigenerational communal village to isolation, mature responsibility to selfish using (Rufus Sewell in an unenviable role as emotional abuser, same role he plays in Illusionist).Unfrenetic The Holiday with its soft music may calm agitated dementia. Specific tempo/rhythm music therapy smooths Alzheimer's, Parkinsonian staccato activity. Music slows festination, urges forward from halts, decreases agitation, eases caregiver burden. Music acts is a whole body metronome, coordinating the timing of muscle movement and taming disquiet.The Caregiver Helpbook, Powerful Tools for CaregiversThe Jack Black character composes music specifically for the Eli Wallach character to encourage him to exercise, give up his walker, accept others' respect for him.In The Holiday the joys of each life stage are celebrated: youthful experiences (the girls' loss of their mother) survived become laughter or wisdom for another generation as Arthur (Eli Wallach) shares his tales of love and moviedom past. Arthur's theme music helps him overcome his fear of steps and speaking in public.The Holiday gently combines multicultural wisdomTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics),The Enchiridionby Epictetus,Cicero De Senectute (On Old Age)in a romantic package: age deserves honor, good guys help us let go of hurtful memories. Everyone is broken in some way, we can help each other. The unit of caring and concern is not an individual alone. Villages of mutual caring, responsibility, assistance and friendship are surrogate families. Healing loneliness is a cooperative, collabortive effort.The Holiday deserves repeated viewing, it celebrates an aging future we all share.",5,Loving respect for age and wisdom,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,3982,"['Holiday', 'message', 'ofSullivan', 'Travels', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'laughter', 'value', 'meaning', 'hope', 'encouragement', 'darkest', 'times.For', 'Holiday', 'combinesThe', 'Empty', 'Mirror', 'Experiences', 'Japanese', 'Zen', 'MonasterywithLost', 'Horizon', 'Novel', 'set', 'music', 'Jerome', 'KernSwing', 'Time', 'tribute', 'film', 'denial', 'escape', 'respite', 'Stock', 'Crash', '1929.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'play', '5', 'singles', 'mashed', 'love', 'who', 'meet-cute', 'hummable', 'music', 'Mirror', 'Has', 'Two', 'Faces', 'when', 'people', 'kiss', 'movies', 'hear', 'Puccini', 'snow-slipping', 'walker-shuffling', 'swimming', 'choreography.The', 'human', 'nostalgia', 'Shangri-La', 'spirituality', 'theology', 'heaven', 'Nirvana', 'chiaroscuro', 'what', 'yearning', 'myth', 'ritual', 'lights', 'color', 'music', 'dance', 'flowers', 'comfort', 'amplifies', 'war', 'economic', 'recession', 'Cinema', 'Holiday', 'ballet', 'symphony', 'libraries', 'museums', 'provide', 'sanctuary', 'generosity', 'time', 'comfort', 'conversation', 'quiet', 'support', 'Also', 'Hannukah', 'beef', 'brisket', 'macaroon', 'leftovers', ""'re"", 'lucky.The', 'Holiday', 'alluding', 'major', 'film', 'film-maker', 'writer', 'production', 'designer', 'costume', 'designer', 'actor', 'music', 'are', 'lovely', 'Jude', 'Law', 'channeling', 'Jerome', 'Kern', 'Way', 'Look', 'Tonight', 'dance', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Film', 'affectionate', 'romantic', 'musical', 'comedy', 'honoring', 'gold', 'mine', 'film', 'history.Ninety', 'year', 'old', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'dignified', 'elder', 'statesman', 'film', 'playing', 'himself.DeparturesThe', 'editing', 'Holiday', 'so', 'crisp', 'momentary', 'allusions', 'films', 'are', 'condensed', 'easily', 'missed', 'seconds', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'playing', 'referencing', 'Graduate', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Parent', 'Trap', '.Jude', 'Law', 'single', 'dad', 'two', 'girls', 'UK', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'type', 'A', 'multitasking', 'LA', 'career', 'woman', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'gumptionless', 'writer', 'editor', 'suffering', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Jack', 'Black', 'kind', 'decent', 'cuckholded', 'music', 'composer', 'Sharing', 'pain', 'escape', 'loneliness', 'discover', 'courageously', 'facing', 'vulnerabilities', 'fears', 'friends', 'somehow', 'reality', 'more', 'tolerable.The', 'settings', 'Surrey', 'LA', 'contrast', 'small', 'village', 'large', 'city', 'homey', 'decency', 'minimalism', 'Art', 'Moderne', 'Art', 'Deco', 'home', 'cooking', 'restaurants', 'courageous', 'honesty', 'problematical', 'pairing', 'multigenerational', 'communal', 'village', 'isolation', 'mature', 'responsibility', 'selfish', 'using', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'unenviable', 'role', 'emotional', 'abuser', 'same', 'role', 'Illusionist', '.Unfrenetic', 'Holiday', 'soft', 'music', 'may', 'calm', 'agitated', 'dementia', 'Specific', 'tempo/rhythm', 'music', 'therapy', 'smooths', 'Alzheimer', 'Parkinsonian', 'staccato', 'activity', 'Music', 'festination', 'forward', 'halts', 'agitation', 'caregiver', 'burden', 'Music', 'acts', 'whole', 'body', 'metronome', 'coordinating', 'timing', 'muscle', 'movement', 'taming', 'disquiet.The', 'Caregiver', 'Helpbook', 'Powerful', 'Tools', 'CaregiversThe', 'Jack', 'Black', 'character', 'composes', 'music', 'specifically', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'character', 'encourage', 'exercise', 'give', 'up', 'walker', 'others', 'respect', 'Holiday', 'joys', 'life', 'stage', 'are', 'celebrated', 'youthful', 'experiences', 'girls', 'loss', 'mother', 'survived', 'become', 'laughter', 'wisdom', 'generation', 'Arthur', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'shares', 'tales', 'love', 'moviedom', 'past', 'Arthur', 'theme', 'music', 'overcome', 'fear', 'steps', 'speaking', 'public.The', 'Holiday', 'gently', 'multicultural', 'wisdomTao', 'Te', 'Ching', 'New', 'English', 'Version', 'Perennial', 'Classics', 'Enchiridionby', 'Epictetus', 'Cicero', 'De', 'Senectute', 'Old', 'Age', 'romantic', 'package', 'age', 'honor', 'good', 'guys', 'help', 'let', 'go', 'hurtful', 'memories', 'Everyone', 'broken', 'way', 'can', 'help', 'other', 'unit', 'caring', 'concern', 'not', 'individual', 'alone', 'Villages', 'mutual', 'caring', 'responsibility', 'assistance', 'friendship', 'are', 'surrogate', 'families', 'Healing', 'loneliness', 'cooperative', 'collabortive', 'effort.The', 'Holiday', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'aging', 'future', 'share']",N/A

1049337,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B000MQC9H4,Scott FS,"[6, 7]","I don't recall ever hearing the name of Nancy Meyers before.  Yet she took a lot on in this production, with both the writing and directing duties.  My feeling is that she is an unusually talented writer, a decent director, and a below-average casting director.Set in LA and England, Amanda Woods (Diaz) and Miles (Black) work together putting together movie trailers.  Woods breaks up with her boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) after she finds out he had an affair.  Miles is in a relationship with a seemingly more stable girlfriend Maggie, who turns out to not be so stable.  Meanwhile, in London, Iris Simpkins (Winslet) has been carrying on a three-year, one-sided affair with co-worker Jasper (Rufus Sewell), while her brother Graham (Jude Law) is busy editing books.  Iris finds out Jasper is engaged with a girl in the circulation department, and has her heart crushed in front of all of her co-workers.  Amanda and Iris are ready for a change.  That comes when they agree to switch houses for the Christmas holiday.In any movie, things have to be believable.  That of course can be stretched in, say, a science fiction movie because we know there is no such thing as time travel, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and there are (unfortunately) no monsters on Mars waiting to attack us as soon as we set foot there.But in a movie such as 'The Holiday', the arc of the relationships have to work, because the whole movie is ABOUT the relationships!  The sumptuous look of the film isn't matched by the casting choices.  In the DVD special feature, writer/director Meyers says she 'loves' Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet and Jack Black.  Well, who doesn't?  At least in individual roles they really fit in.  I loved Jack Black in School of Rock.  He was just perfect.  Here, he isn't.  There is zero chemistry between the staid Winslet, who plays a newspaper reporter in London's Daily Telegraph, and Black, who is back to his music by portraying a composer for the movies and movie trailers.  Try as he might, Black just doesn't fit well with Winslet at all.The other pairing in the film, Diaz with Jude Law is equally unbelievable.  Diaz, in the Meg Ryan role (ditsy blonde, long in heart and cutesy) had nothing in common with the down-to-earth Law.  They just don't fit, and you don't believe for a minute that these two could really end up together.Ironically, if the male leads were switched, the chemistry might actually work, especially with the non-manic Winslet and the equally settled Law.  The potential match between Black and Diaz might be a bit less convincing, because, let's face it, Diaz is a major beauty, and Black is always ruffled, no matter how often is shirt and pants are ironed.  Still, you could see it.But you just NEVER buy the pairing as put forth in this film.I must comment, however, on the sparkling writing of Ms. Meyers.  This woman can write dialog with the best I've run across in the past decade.  Her writing is such that you notice how excellent it is, and you make a point of find out who came up with this.  There's one scene with Jude Law talking to Diaz about how to make their relationship work that has pacing, inflection, cadence and lyrical tone that is just outstanding.Oh, and a note about Eli Wallach, who turned 90 during the filming.  His character (Aurthur Abbott) is sweet and light-hearted and wonderful.  He plays a writer (I suspect Meyers chose that career because of her own talents) who has won many awards, but 'hasn't been busy since 1978'. Iris (Winslet) finds out that the Hollywood community wants to honor a lifetime of writing, but he doesn't want to go.  Winslet convinces him to go, and Abbott finds out that many haven't forgotten about him after all.  Not to put a fine point on it, but the Winslet-Wallach pairing DOES have chemistry.  Their personalities mesh with a 50 year age difference better that the putative pairings of the film.Over all, three stars.  One star only for the casting.  Terrible, and it ruins the film.  Five stars for the writing.  Four stars for the actors when they are not with their supposed 'magical matches'.  Two stars for Black and Diaz when they are with Winslet and Law, and four stars for acting for Winslet and Law with they are with their 'mates'.

1049338,A2GBPUG5DT13XK,B000MQC9H4,S. Dickerson,"[32, 53]","Okay, maybe my review title deserves one star as well, but I couldn't resist. I also am a girl who definitely appreciates good romantic comedy. I actually loved Love Actually. But this movie was simply one of the worst movies I've ever wasted two hours on.Where to begin? The dialogue is completely unbelievable and cheesy. I cringed, I was so embarrassed for the actors having to utter the lines. The plot is implausible, with embarrassing devices like the stupid winds out in LA making crazy things happen. The acting...I have always liked Kate Winslet and Jack Black. And on occasion I've enjoyed watching Cameron Diaz and Jude Law. But each and every one of them seemed to be phoning it in. Well, I don't know about Cameron -- she succeeded in making her character a completely unlikeable person, and I found myself hoping for her romance to fail. Also Jude Law looks suspiciously orange all through the movie. He looked like he tasted of cheese. Not a good look, especially compared to how dreamy he looked in a movie like Enemy at the Gates. Not only that, his character comes off as so smarmy that you'd wonder why Diaz would be genuinely attached to him in the first place. The same goes for Rufus Sewell's character, who appears in the beginning as the man who strings Kate Winslet on. He is obviously so toxic and buffoonish; while Winslet is so obviously too smart and lovely for him. It's just not believable that she was ever under his spell.Overall, I thought the movie was simultaneously trying to pander to its audience while actually succeeding in insulting it. At least, I felt insulted. While Love Actually isn't a perfect movie, at least it was far better written and acted and therefore infinitely more palatable as an escapist chick flick.

It was strikingly absurd.She, of course, looked wonderful, which may have been a big part of the problem. Diaz tends to look as if she is thrilled even when she is supposed to be a woman repressed. I would assume she could not bring herself to believe the character. Perhaps that is the cause of her stumbling portrayal of A--You see? I just finished watching the film and have completely forgotten the name of the lead.The perennially bubbly Diaz, who may have very well fallen in love with the rambling script, was unable to translate the innumerable complications of the character for which she was cast, leaving this humble viewer at a loss. This storyline would have been better served had an unknown been in her place.There were some very moving scenes that bear viewing- about 1/20th of the film's content.I could charge the director, who rightfully should be made to shoulder some of the blame, or the cinematographer, who oafishly ground several scenes into a clumsy mass, but I won't.Jack Black played his pseudo-type well. Kate Winslet was able to deliver the fine points of Iris' conflicted woe. Eli Wallach erased the seams between personality and self and Jude Law fought graciously to maintain professionalism as he played against a cold fish. (If you look closely, you may be able to detect a tinge of frustration.)I know she could do better.But wait... perhaps I could post a big box of blame to the writers, who numbly delivered a working script full of lame attempts at realism. Nearly, nearly... not quite so. It's a feel-good gone bad, or a mediocre dream gone worse.And thusly, 136 minutes of my sad life gone-- not to mention the expense put towards what became a tortuous non-event-- never to be regained.Ok, so the character's name was Amanda. I admit I remember. Nevertheless, if you're thinking of renting or purchasing this film site-unseen, let me dissuade you. Do not walk the dark path I have walked in order to say you've been there.

1049356,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B000MQC9H4,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[5, 7]","I dreamed about writer-director  Nancy Myers' THE HOLIDAY last night.  It is a honey of a romantic comedy, something out of Hollywood's golden age.  No one smokes, witty dialogue substitutes for swearing, love scenes are passionate kisses, and violence is slapstick comedy.  Myers loves old Hollywood; with her ex-husband, Charles Shyer, she made the successful remakes of THE PARENT TRAP and FATHER OF THE BRIDE and its sequel.  By herself she wrote and directed the romantic and funny WHAT WOMEN WANT and SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.What a wonderful cast Myers has for THE HOLIDAY, which is about ""house swapping"" at Christmas time.  Kate Winslet (Iris) is a London journalist who lives in a storybook cottage south of London.  She finds that the man she loves is about to get married to someone else.  Cameron Diaz (Amanda) lives in a Beverly Hills mansion, designs movie trailers, and has just kicked out an unfaithful live-in boyfriend.  The two women ""meet cute"" on the Internet, Amanda answering Iris' ad for someone to swap houses for Christmas season.  It is perfect for both, as it always is in movies of this type and never is in real life--Iris is lonely in her cottage, while Amanda craves someplace small and quiet.  Diaz and Winslet are both wonderful.  Myers' lovely script makes them come alive as actresses with witty dialogue and romantic situations at holiday time.Soon Amanda finds Jude Law (Iris' brother Graham) on her English cottage doorstep and, of course, falls in love with him almost instantly, especially when she learns he is a widower with two small children.  And Iris has two very different men pop up in her life in Los Angeles:  Jack Black (KING KONG) as a film composer named Winston, and Eli Wallach (in his best role in decades) as a 90 year old retired screenwriter.  All of the performances are superb, miracle of miracles no one smokes or swears (thank you, Nancy), and Myers (and her designers) do magical things to contrast Los Angeles and rural England at Christmas season.The ending is Hollywood fairy tale romance that you can see coming from the film's mid-point on, but it still makes you feel in love with life and movies out of a bygone era.  The only flaws are a Hans Zimmer score so obtrusive that I had to turn on the English subtitles on my DVD player to get the dialogue, and the movie runs a bit too long at 136 minutes.  Otherwise, THE HOLIDAY is pure cinematic magic with five wonderful actors in peak form.  I can't wait to see what the incomparably talented Nancy Myers does next.",4,"A wonderful ""old Hollywood"" Christmas season romance",1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,2537,"['dreamed', 'writer-director', 'Nancy', 'Myers', 'THE', 'HOLIDAY', 'last', 'night', 'honey', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age', 'one', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'substitutes', 'swearing', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'passionate', 'kisses', 'violence', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'Myers', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'ex-husband', 'Charles', 'Shyer', 'made', 'successful', 'remakes', 'THE', 'PARENT', 'TRAP', 'FATHER', 'THE', 'BRIDE', 'sequel', 'wrote', 'directed', 'romantic', 'funny', 'WHAT', 'WOMEN', 'WANT', 'SOMETHING', 'GOT', 'TO', 'GIVE.What', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Myers', 'THE', 'HOLIDAY', 'house', 'swapping', 'Christmas', 'time', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Iris', 'London', 'journalist', 'who', 'storybook', 'cottage', 'south', 'London', 'man', 'get', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Amanda', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'mansion', 'movie', 'trailers', 'just', 'kicked', 'out', 'unfaithful', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'two', 'women', 'meet', 'cute', 'Internet', 'Amanda', 'answering', 'Iris', 'ad', 'someone', 'swap', 'houses', 'Christmas', 'season', 'perfect', 'always', 'movies', 'type', 'never', 'real', 'life', 'Iris', 'lonely', 'cottage', 'Amanda', 'someplace', 'small', 'quiet', 'Diaz', 'Winslet', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Myers', 'lovely', 'script', 'come', 'alive', 'actresses', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'romantic', 'situations', 'holiday', 'time.Soon', 'Amanda', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Iris', 'brother', 'Graham', 'English', 'cottage', 'doorstep', 'course', 'love', 'almost', 'instantly', 'especially', 'when', 'widower', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'Iris', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'pop', 'up', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Jack', 'Black', 'KING', 'KONG', 'film', 'composer', 'named', 'Winston', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'best', 'role', 'decades', '90', 'year', 'old', 'retired', 'screenwriter', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'miracle', 'miracles', 'one', 'swears', 'thank', 'Nancy', 'Myers', 'designers', 'do', 'magical', 'things', 'contrast', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'rural', 'England', 'Christmas', 'season.The', 'ending', 'Hollywood', 'fairy', 'tale', 'romance', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'film', 'mid-point', 'still', 'feel', 'love', 'life', 'movies', 'bygone', 'era', 'only', 'flaws', 'are', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'so', 'obtrusive', 'had', 'turn', 'English', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'player', 'get', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'bit', 'too', 'long', '136', 'minutes', 'Otherwise', 'HOLIDAY', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'five', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'peak', 'form', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'incomparably', 'talented', 'Nancy', 'Myers', 'next']",N/A

The house exchanges are between Surrey, England and Los Angeles. I thought that the plot was unique which is so hard because ""it's all been done"".

1049376,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000MQC9H4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 26]","There are two stories at work in Nancy Meyer's new film ""The Holiday"". One of these stories works, only occasionally veering into sitcom territory. The other stays firmly rooted in sitcom purgatory. Interestingly, the story that works also stars the better actress. I'll give you one hint. The better actress isn't Cameron Diaz.Amanda (Cameron Diaz), the owner of a company that edits movie trailers, breaks up with her boyfriend, Ethan (Edward Burns). Because Christmas is just around the corner, she doesn't want to spend the holiday alone, so she decides to travel. She explores a few websites and then comes across a home exchange program, decides on England and finds a photo of a cottage in Surrey, forty minutes outside of London. The owner of the cottage, Iris (Kate Winslet), a columnist at a London newspaper, is trying to come to terms with her unrequited love of Jasper (Rufus Sewell), another columnist at the paper. She still holds out hope, until his engagement to another woman is announced at the company Christmas party. That night, she receives an e-mail from Amanda. ""Is your cottage still available?"" The next day, each is jetting off to the other's countries. Iris is overjoyed to find Amanda's home has a large kitchen, a gym, a swimming pool and more. She immediately makes herself at home. She meets Arthur (Eli Wallach), an aging widower who lives next door. Arthur used to write movies, in the 40s, and Iris is immediately drawn into his tales of old Hollywood. One day, Miles (Jack Black), a film composer, stops by to pick up some of Ethan's things. After a while, they form a friendship and help each other deal with their respective relationship problems. In England, Amanda soon realizes the error of her thinking (naturally, the first thing you want to do to keep from feeling lonely is to fly to a foreign country, alone, for the holidays) and is ready to fly back to Los Angeles when Graham (Jude law), Iris' brother arrives on her doorstep. They immediately sleep together and Amanda decides England isn't such a bad place after all.""The Holiday"" continues a trend established by writer - producer - director Nancy Meyers. For every hit, she follows with two or three flops. She made ""Baby Boom"" and followed that with some forgettable films. In the last few years, she has made ""What Woman Want"" and then ""Something's Gotta Give"", a critical and financial hit starring Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson in one of their best performances. So that makes ""The Holiday"" a...Actually, it isn't a flop. Not exactly. It is just extremely uneven.Let's start with the good.Kate Winslet has always been an extremely likable and believable actress. In each of her films, she is able to create a character we can believe in, even when the story veers off into fantastical realms. A large part of this ability comes from her extremely `normal' looks; Winslet is very pretty and nice to watch, but she isn't a bombshell. She looks like a normal person, which makes it easier to accept her in this type of role.As Iris, she makes the character sympathetic, interesting and intelligent. When she receives the news of Jasper's engagement, she travels home in a fog. Upon her arrival, she immediately lets the water works flow and she can't seem to stop. As soon as she arrives in Los Angeles, her joy at the sight of Amanda's home is almost palpable; most of us would also be overjoyed to find a mansion at our feet, ready to use for our holiday. When she meets Arthur, she befriends him out a mixture of human interest and neediness. After she gives him a ride home, she realizes he is a lonely old man and invites him to dinner where he begins to share stories of his days in old Hollywood and she becomes entranced.Then, she meets Miles. He is in a relationship with an actress, Maggie (Shannon Shassoman, ""A Knight's Tale"") and even though he feels a little bit of a spark, he is clearly in love with his girlfriend and just wants to be friends with Amanda. They form a bond as they work on an event featuring Arthur, growing closer and closer. Then, his relationship with Maggie changes and they each demonstrate their growing attraction.The key to this story, its believability, is that it is played fairly straight. There are occasional moments when it veers into sitcom territory, such as when Black starts singing the signature tunes of his favorite scores, but for the most part, it is believable, sweet and sincere.Black is also surprisingly good as Miles. It is by far his most natural, believable performance in many years. Because he is in a relationship with Maggie when he meets Iris, he isn't able to show his feelings. But there is an attraction there and they become friends, both becoming involved with Arthur's life. Then, when he realizes he has been cheated on, Miles realizes he has the perfect mate standing right in front of him.Both Iris and Miles share similar relationship troubles and they compliment each other nicely. When Mile`s ex-girlfriend says she wants him back, he naturally runs to her side, much like Iris is willing to drop everything for Jasper. The moment when they each realize their current relationships are not going to work is also handled well and believable. As they develop a bond, we watch with interest.Then there is the Amanda story. Two of the reasons Amanda's boyfriend cheats on her are: she is unable to cry and she is obsessed with work, to the point that she had an edit suite installed in her home. Meyers seems to feel these two items allow her license to make Amanda as much like Lucy Ricardo as possible. Throughout the film, we see shots of Cameron Diaz trying to cry, squinting her eyes up, in an attempt to be emotional. These come off as fake as they sound. Perhaps a more talented actress would have been able to make this work. Perhaps. Early in the film, Amanda visits her edit suite and watches the newest trailer her assistant has finished, an action film featuring Lindsay Lohan and James Franco (a nice touch of comedy since the actors are actually in the trailer and it appears to be very `Hollywood'.) Later, ""Holiday"" shows us a trailer version of Amanda's relationship woes, complete with grave, serious narration. Later, the narration returns, but no visual. They didn't take this joke far enough. It is a funny idea; naturally, anyone so obsessed with their job would begin to see everything in familiar terms. But to only see one trailer depicting her sad love life? This isn't enough.Throughout the film, Diaz is always talking, running off at the mouth, making Amanda an extremely annoying character. In every scene, she launches into a lengthy monologue about some state of her relationship with someone. Amanda and Graham start to make jokes about her incessant talking, but it doesn't make the character more believable. At one point, she complains about all of the books she hasn't read. Yeeeeesssshhhhh!The entire film is grounded in a world of fairy tales. From Iris' snow bound cottage to the fact both women jet off to a foreign country to share their homes the day after they meet, this is clearly not a story happening in the real world. At one point, after Iris meets Arthur, he talks about the ""Meet Cute"" moments in romantic comedies. ""A man and a woman go to a department store. Each wants to buy pajamas, but the man says he just needs the bottoms and the woman says she just needs a top. That's a Meet Cute moment"". ""The Holiday"" attempts its own Meet Cute. Graham arrives on Iris' doorstep stinking drunk. Because his sister left so quickly, he doesn't know she is gone until he meets Amanda. After a brief conversation, they realize neither wants a relationship, and Amanda is planning to leave the next day, so they, naturally, decide to sleep together. This is a phenomenally bad idea. Not only does it rob the film, or at least this story's part of the film, of any romance, it makes both Amanda and Graham slightly unlikable. Yes, Graham is good looking and Amanda is attractive, but why would they sleep together five minutes after they meet? The relationship has nowhere to go from there, except down.Because Jude Law's Graham is in the Amanda story, he naturally suffers by association. But Meyers is clearly trying to amp up the charming factor of Law's persona. Many people have compared him to Cary Grant and ""The Holiday"" seems to be trying to encourage this. Graham is from Surrey, where Cary Grant was born, a fact not lost on the film as it is mentioned in the dialogue. Then, in one scene, Law dons glasses which look extremely similar to the same type of glasses worn by Grant in the classic Howard Hawk's comedy ""Bringing Up Baby"", yet another fact I doubt is lost on Meyers. So, throughout the film, Law appears charming and attractive and every bit the leading man he should be. If he would only appear in better films.Eli Wallach has a sweet turn as Arthur, the aging widower living next door to Amanda. As he and Iris form a friendship, Iris learns the Writer's Guild has been pestering him to let them host a salute to him. She also learns they want to do it next week, yet another fairy tale element of the film. This allows for Iris to still be in town for the big event, but is a completely implausible story point. These types of events take months to plan. That aside, it allows for Arthur and Iris to work towards this event and the moment Arthur steps into the auditorium is a nice moment.The final moment of ""The Holiday"" is easily the worst conclusion I have seen in a film all year. It almost seems like Meyers had no idea how to end the film, felt it was necessary to have at least one scene with both Winslet and Diaz and came up with what ends the film. It doesn't work. At all. It seems like one of those bad films from the 60s or 70s, when all of the main characters start dancing at the end of the film, as though there is simply not enough money left to shoot that final scene, the one that provides a resolution to the story. Yes, it seems exactly like that.""The Holiday"" is a mixed bag. Some might enjoy the story with Iris and her two friends,  and Arthur. But you will have to sit through an interminable amount of overacting on the part of Cameron Diaz. I'm not sure the film is worth that agony.",2,"Gives ""Chick Flick"" a Bad Name",1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,10261,"['are', 'two', 'stories', 'work', 'Nancy', 'Meyer', 'new', 'film', 'Holiday',

The story is cute, the main characters are cute, and the premise of running off on holiday to assuage romantic heartbreaks is cute.  With all the cuteness out of the way,  the film is entertaining and has some memorable lines like ""boob graze"" and "" I haven't been busy since 1978.""  It has a curl up and watch feel that a lot of chicks will love.  By no means is it meant to be an exercise in intellectual stimulation and it only asks you to fall in love with Iris' cottage and Amanda's mansion and to believe that Grahams really do exist.  It proves that bad boyfriends and girlfriends can't change and that everything is solved by simply moving on.  Kate and Rufus' talents were only taken lightly and Jude Law just had to look pretty and cheerful.  Cameron was, well, Cameron and Jack was just another version of Jack.  But something makes you like the movie despite the drawbacks.  Ladies, enjoy watching and being transported away from your daily grind.

I thoroughly enjoyed this lighthearted movie of four people struggling with love coming into their own realizations that finally lead them to those kind of individuals that bring out the best in them as human beings.I'm not much of a Cameron Diaz fan, but I thought she was great.  Kate Winslet was wonderful as well, totally unpretentious in character, which I found surprising.  Jude Law is to die for, as usual.  Jack Black was finally in a serious role.  Good flick, not filled with cursing and the usual nudity that Hollywood thinks makes a good movie, which in fact, it takes away from the emotion, struggles, and ultimate outcomes that are more important.
