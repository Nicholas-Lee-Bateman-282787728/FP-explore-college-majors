1136321,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0012D6AUI,Galina,"[2, 2]","Pearl Diver (2004) is a beautiful, thoughtful, moving, involving and uplifting movie about two sisters who used to be very close in their childhood on the rural farm where they grew up in a Mennonite community. One tragic night, their mother was murdered by two intruders who tried to find something in their house. The girls' lives were changed forever. That night took them apart, and only twenty years later when another tragedy strikes, the sisters begin to unravel the mystery of old trauma. This is the film debut by writer /director Sidney King. He's got his own style in telling the story and creating and exploring interesting complex characters, not loud and flashy but clear, distinguished, and very attractive. I am especially pleased to see in one of the important roles the famous Russian stage and screen actor, Eugene Lazarev. His character provides the necessary depth to the story, he is a keeper of history and he holds the key to the mystery of what could be the reason for past tragedy that put the long shadow to the lives of the girls and their relationship. There is a short documentary on the disc, narrated by King where he talks on the purpose of movie, the reasons he made it and about  the characters and their story.",4,Thoughtful and moving picture,1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,1246,"['Pearl', 'Diver', '2004', 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'moving', 'involving', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'very', 'close', 'childhood', 'rural', 'farm', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'Mennonite', 'community', 'One', 'tragic', 'night', 'mother', 'was', 'murdered', 'two', 'intruders', 'who', 'tried', 'find', 'something', 'house', 'girls', 'lives', 'were', 'changed', 'forever', 'night', 'took', 'apart', 'only', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'sisters', 'begin', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'old', 'trauma', 'film', 'debut', 'writer', '/director', 'Sidney', 'King', 'got', 'own', 'style', 'telling', 'story', 'creating', 'exploring', 'interesting', 'complex', 'characters', 'not', 'loud', 'flashy', 'clear', 'distinguished', 'very', 'attractive', 'am', 'especially', 'pleased', 'see', 'one', 'important', 'roles', 'famous', 'Russian', 'stage', 'screen', 'actor', 'Eugene', 'Lazarev', 'character', 'necessary', 'depth', 'story', 'keeper', 'history', 'key', 'mystery', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'past', 'tragedy', 'put', 'long', 'shadow', 'lives', 'girls', 'relationship', 'short', 'documentary', 'disc', 'narrated', 'King', 'where', 'purpose', 'movie', 'reasons', 'made', 'characters', 'story']",Pearl Diver

I had never even heard of this film until earlier this week, so I decided to give it a try.The story is engaging, but veers into cliched territory on more than one occasion. The acting leaves much to be desired, but is not unwatchable. Shot on a very low budget, and looks that way. This film may have been edited with a chainsaw...If you have an hour and a half to spare, and aren't in the mood for anything challenging, you couldn't do much worse than PEARL DIVER.",2,"Somewhat engrossing, cliched family feature...",1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,502,"['First', 'time', 'effort', 'Sidney', 'King', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'earlier', 'week', 'decided', 'give', 'try.The', 'story', 'engaging', 'veers', 'cliched', 'territory', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'acting', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'Shot', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'way', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'chainsaw', 'have', 'hour', 'half', 'spare', 'are', ""n't"", 'mood', 'anything', 'challenging', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'PEARL', 'DIVER']",Pearl Diver

You just have to stick with it for a while as it starts off very slowly and doesn't ever pick up a lot of speed. Then again, it's not an action movie.  The acting is tolerable, with two adult sisters diverging on how to remember their murdered mother and deal with the tragic farm accident that befalls the daughter of one of them.Some flaws:  A lot of the dialogue is repetitive.  Also, spoilers ahead.......The ending disappoints me as  writer.  I would not have tossed my hard work away like that.  The character could have used a pseudonym and published it as fiction in order to spare others' feelings instead of just chucking it all wastefully.",3,"nicely photographed, inspiring story; some flaws also",1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,763,"['beautifully', 'photographed', 'Goshen', 'Indiana', 'story', 'compelling', 'enough', 'certainly', 'original', 'just', 'have', 'stick', 'while', 'very', 'slowly', ""n't"", 'ever', 'pick', 'up', 'lot', 'speed', 'Then', 'again', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'acting', 'tolerable', 'two', 'adult', 'sisters', 'diverging', 'how', 'remember', 'murdered', 'mother', 'deal', 'tragic', 'farm', 'accident', 'daughter', 'one', 'them.Some', 'flaws', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'repetitive', 'Also', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'ending', 'disappoints', 'writer', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'tossed', 'hard', 'work', 'away', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'pseudonym', 'published', 'fiction', 'order', 'spare', 'others', 'feelings', 'instead', 'just', 'chucking', 'wastefully']",Pearl Diver
