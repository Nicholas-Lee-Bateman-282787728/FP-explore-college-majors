Pfeffer ""apfeffer""","[103, 104]","I saw this film in a commercial-ridden broadcast on the Ovation Channel and enjoyed it, so I expect the commercial-free DVD to be even more attractive.  I'm not always a fan of Tony Palmer's bio-pics--like all biographers these days and as his title suggests, he portrays his celebrity subjects as exploited victims, no matter how successful, acclaimed, privileged, and controlling they really were.  Here, though, ""sorrow"" emerges not from villainous parents, impresarios, lovers, capitalists, or fascists, but from the composer's life as a victim of history.  Specifically, crushing critical hostility toward his early works and then, just as he settled in as a renowned master composer, the Bolshevik revolution and permanent exile from his beloved homeland.  This story is told compellingly and quite objectively, with stirring musical examples and without melodramatic re-enactments.  No sign either, thank goodness, of snooty modernist musicologists denouncing Rachmaninoff's music as ""kitsch.""  Some of the photography of the Russian countryside with its birch forests is stunning.  I didn't expect that consummate non-Russian John Gielgud to serve well as the voice(-over) of Rachmaninoff, but he turns out to be ideal and very droll, capturing the composer's dourness, frustration with bustling Western society, and nostalgia for the old country and the ancestral estates.

1073546,A2KR73ZUP5MV1T,B000Q66Q10,"KJG ""Katie""","[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this interesting biography about the life of the great Russian composer and pianist, Sergei Rachmaninoff, one of the last  great representatives of Romanticism in Russian classical music.  Born in 1873 in northwestern Russia to impoverished Russian aristocrats, Rachmaninoff loved his country, yet it became necessary for him to leave Russia forever in 1917 because of the Bolshevik Revolution.  Rachmaninoff was 44 at the time, and as a result of this life shattering event, considered himself an exile for the rest of his life.  Tony Palmer tells his beautifully filmed story via home movies, concert clips, and a variety of interviews.  Harvest of Sorrow, the title of the documentary to me signifies Rachmaninoff's deep longing for his home, for although he did eventually become an American citizen, his heart remained in his Motherland --in Russia, forever!Two of his most famous compositions are his Piano Concerto #2 in C minor, as well as the 18th variation of his creative Rhapsody on a Theme from Paganini.  His second piano concerto is one of the most beloved classical pieces ever written.  Numerous movies have this concerto featured, including the British film, Brief Encounter.Interestingly, Rachmaninoff wrote his 2nd piano concerto as he was coming out of a three year bout of depression, resulting to a large degree, from the scathing criticism he received when his First Symphony debuted in St. Petersburg in 1897.  Interestingly his first symphony is now considered a significant achievement.He dedicated this piano concerto to Nikolai Dahl, a Russian physician who used hypnosis on Rachmaninoff to help restore his self confidence.As a music therapist, as well as spiritual director, I have used this beautiful classical composition (Piano Concerto #2) when working with depressed clients.  I have always felt it was so effective, most especially the final movement.  To me it is as if Rachmaninoff documents musically his own depression and, more importantly, the overcoming of that depression.  Anyway, to learn more about Rachmaninoff's amazing life and in addition hear his unbelievably beautiful music, do take a look.",5,Yearning for Home,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2162,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'interesting', 'biography', 'life', 'great', 'Russian', 'composer', 'pianist', 'Sergei', 'Rachmaninoff', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'representatives', 'Romanticism', 'Russian', 'classical', 'music', 'Born', '1873', 'northwestern', 'Russia', 'impoverished', 'Russian', 'aristocrats', 'Rachmaninoff', 'loved', 'country', 'became', 'necessary', 'leave', 'Russia', 'forever', '1917', 'Bolshevik', 'Revolution', 'Rachmaninoff', 'was', '44', 'time', 'result', 'life', 'shattering', 'event', 'considered', 'exile', 'rest', 'life', 'Tony', 'Palmer', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'story', 'home', 'movies', 'concert', 'clips', 'variety', 'interviews', 'Harvest', 'Sorrow', 'title', 'documentary', 'Rachmaninoff', 'deep', 'longing', 'home', 'did', 'eventually', 'become', 'American', 'citizen', 'heart', 'remained', 'Motherland', 'Russia', 'forever', 'Two', 'most', 'famous', 'compositions', 'are', 'Piano', 'Concerto', '2', 'C', 'minor', 'as', 'well', '18th', 'variation', 'creative', 'Rhapsody', 'Theme', 'Paganini', 'second', 'piano', 'concerto', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'classical', 'pieces', 'ever', 'written', 'Numerous', 'movies', 'have', 'concerto', 'featured', 'including', 'British', 'film', 'Brief', 'Encounter.Interestingly', 'Rachmaninoff', 'wrote', '2nd', 'piano', 'concerto', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'three', 'year', 'bout', 'depression', 'resulting', 'large', 'degree', 'scathing', 'criticism', 'received', 'when', 'First', 'Symphony', 'debuted', 'St.', 'Petersburg', '1897', 'Interestingly', 'first', 'symphony', 'now', 'considered', 'significant', 'achievement.He', 'dedicated', 'piano', 'concerto', 'Nikolai', 'Dahl', 'Russian', 'physician', 'who', 'used', 'hypnosis', 'Rachmaninoff', 'help', 'restore', 'self', 'music', 'therapist', 'as', 'well', 'spiritual', 'director', 'have', 'used', 'beautiful', 'classical', 'composition', 'Piano', 'Concerto', '2', 'when', 'working', 'depressed', 'clients', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'so', 'effective', 'most', 'especially', 'final', 'movement', 'Rachmaninoff', 'documents', 'musically', 'own', 'depression', 'more', 'importantly', 'overcoming', 'depression', 'Anyway', 'learn', 'more', 'Rachmaninoff', 'amazing', 'life', 'addition', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'music', 'do', 'take', 'look']",Harvest of Sorrow - Tony Palmer's Film About Sergei Rachmaninoff
