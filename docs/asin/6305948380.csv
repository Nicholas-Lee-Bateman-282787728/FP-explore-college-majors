I wasn't expecting much from this DVD, but was hoping at least that my daughter would watch it. Although it did bring back memories, I felt that I would have rather just rented it, as after watching the typical poor effects, and all my reminiscencing, my daughter or me wasn't interested anymore in watching the ... stop motion of the dinosaurs or of the poor costumes and sets. The only plus to the DVD was that I was able to see a few of the stars and what they look like now. There are multiple episodes on this DVD, but watching 1 is usually enough for the average person to say,  ""oh yeah, I remember this show, What else is on TV?"". They also have some commentary. I guess we sort of got spoiled with these new age special affects.

But its like a lost world kind of secret land. They arrive there and have to survive amidst dinosaurs and weird creatures , and theres caves and rivers and they have to get food to survive. Its quite realistic at times because they really try to get food, and find ways to get carrots and fruits from trees, and they find shelter in a rock cave high up that they call high bluff. The father thinks they should keep trying to get home and they found some kind of portal doorway to get back. He wants to get home and they keep trying to get through.

This show had everything a boy could ask for in a TV show in the early to mid 70's:  dinosaurs, adventure, scary monsters, and an underlying creepiness that  tingled the spine.

The  extras are interesting, but too brief. The interview with the Krofts peaked  my interest in many ways, but I feel that a lot of intersting stuff was  edited out, particularly relating to their early years (there's a bit about  how holyman Billy Graham condemned them at the Seattle World's Fair in the  early sixties because of sexy topless puppets featured in a show of theirs,  which of course helped them to be the hottest show there, for example). The  bit with the actors who played Chaka and Holly was interesting and all, but  I wish they could have got more players involved to show up.Also, while  the four episodes are excellent, I wish they would instead release the  entire series chronologically as a box set.

This is a Saturday morning show by the same people that brought you Sigmund and the Sea Monsters and the immortal H.R. Puffnstuff.  The only acting to be found, when it's found is over-acting.  The dialog is at times head-slappingly bad, and the constant bickering between Will and Holly gets so annoying, you have to wonder why Marshal doesn't throw himself down the Sleestack pit. The special effects range from the ""actually pretty darn good for the budget"" sort, to the downright laughable.  But then again that's part of the charm.The dinosaurs are fairly well done for the time, especially Dopey--I mean you gotta love Dopey.  The Sleestack are still one of the best bad guys ever invented, and the overall concept is actually quite well written.That's really where the strength of the series is--in the big picture moments and details regarding the pillons, crystals, and the inner workings of the world.Having still been in diapers for at least part of the series' original run, I didn't have any clue who some of the people working on the show where, Gerald, Niven, Koenig. I was still young enough to be scared by Big Alice and Grumpy, how could I know who David Gerald was?  But thirty years later when I rented the first disc of season one, just for the nostalgia factor, I rediscovered that the series was actually good enough to re-watch the entire thing.

I don't know how kids today will react to it, given all the high-tech special f/x that are taken  for granted.  The fact is, this show really had a lot of good ideas behind  it and it stands up well.  From an adult perspective, it's fun to look at  how horrible the f/x look, and wonder how I ever was convinced it was  real.Some of the stuff in these four episodes is pretty far out.  Consider the part when ape-boy Chaka comes over for dinner, and little  Holly gets all dolled up with make-up and perfume.  As Chaka becomes  apparently very attracted to the young girl, her brother and father chuckle  about how she's &quot;becoming a woman.&quot;  Then later, Chaka and his  ape-parents kidnap Holly and take her back to their home where they can't  stop oogling her and sniffing her body (supposedly its because of the  perfume).  Pretty weird...The DVD is a good value for the price.  There  are four episodes which run approximately 22 minutes each.  For bonus  features there is a very interesting 16-minute interview with Sid and Marty  Krofft and even more entertaining a 14-minute new interview with the actor  that played Chaka and the actress that played Holly.  The adult Chaka is a  relatively composed and dignified man.  The woman that played Holly,  however, laughs hysterically throughout the interview.  She seems kind of  demented.  And boy oh boy-- I had a crush on Holly as a kid, but I would  have never thought she would look like this today-- Yikes!",5,"Great show, and not just for kids--",964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,1599,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'was', 'about', '5', '6', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'store', 'grabbed', 'immediately', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'kids', 'today', 'will', 'react', 'given', 'high-tech', 'special', 'f/x', 'are', 'taken', 'granted', 'fact', 'show', 'really', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'ideas', 'up', 'well', 'adult', 'perspective', 'fun', 'look', 'how', 'horrible', 'f/x', 'look', 'wonder', 'how', 'ever', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'real.Some', 'stuff', 'four', 'episodes', 'pretty', 'far', 'out', 'Consider', 'part', 'when', 'ape-boy', 'Chaka', 'over', 'dinner', 'little', 'Holly', 'dolled', 'up', 'make-up', 'perfume', 'Chaka', 'apparently', 'very', 'attracted', 'young', 'girl', 'brother', 'father', 'chuckle', 'how', 'quot', 'becoming', 'woman.', 'quot', 'Then', 'later', 'Chaka', 'ape-parents', 'kidnap', 'Holly', 'take', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'oogling', 'sniffing', 'body', 'supposedly', 'perfume', 'Pretty', 'weird', 'DVD', 'good', 'value', 'price', 'are', 'four', 'episodes', 'run', 'approximately', '22', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'features', 'very', 'interesting', '16-minute', 'interview', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Krofft', 'even', 'more', 'entertaining', '14-minute', 'new', 'interview', 'actor', 'played', 'Chaka', 'actress', 'played', 'Holly', 'adult', 'Chaka', 'relatively', 'composed', 'dignified', 'man', 'woman', 'played', 'Holly', 'however', 'hysterically', 'interview', 'kind', 'demented', 'boy', 'oh', 'boy', 'had', 'crush', 'Holly', 'kid', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'look', 'today', 'Yikes']",N/A
