The suspense builds up nicely, and Zoe Saldana does a superb acting job. But about half-way through the movie we know what's going on with her troublesome pregnancy, and so the only thing left, really, is what will they do with the baby? The tension builds up and then fizzles out at the end. This movie, as well as the 1968 original, suffer from the same fatal flaw of cheating the viewer of the expectations built from the increasing suspense along the way. Just imagine how viewers would  feel if they were watching an increasingly suspenseful who-dunnit, and in the end the chief detective declares,&#34;Sorry, folks, we made a mistake.

1697178,A1CT3VC2YHL2NC,B00KA0VE2S,John J. Schauer,"[7, 10]","With all due respect to reviewer John Bowen, one does not need to be a person who ""hates all remakes"" to find this one sadly lacking. Yes, the production values are high and the acting is good. But it is now an entirely different, and far less effective, movie.For starters, to pander to today's audiences' bloodlust, a lot of graphic gore has been added, something that was completely absent in the magnificent original. For instance, when Rosemary is told that her apartment building once housed the notorious ""Trench Sisters,"" who allegedly indulged in cannibalism, instead of learning about it through a casual reference in conversation, as in the original, here we have to be subjected to a flashback sequence showing the sisters kill and graphically dismember a man, blood squirting in their faces, a hatchet hacking off his arm, etc. And where Rosemary's friend Hutch, who tries to warn her, discreetly dies off camera in a coma in the original (and teasingly leaves us wondering what exactly happened), here he (changed now to an investigative police officer) has convulsions in his car with blood running out of his nose before being squashed like a bug by a large truck that smears him all over the pavement like a giant packet of ketchup. What was gained by this?More detrimental is the fact that this remake gives away too much, way too soon. What made the original such an effective chiller was the fact that so much was left ambiguous up until the end. The viewer of that version has to piece together the various bits of evidence at the same time Rosemary does, so that we share in her gradual discovery and growing horror. In the remake, it is quickly established upfront that the Castevets are evil Satanists who have supernatural powers and can grotesquely kill people at their whim, which they do in several additional scenes of gratuitous bloodshed. As a result, the final revelation that was so shocking in the original becomes entirely anticlimactic, almost beside the point.One is forced to ask why this remake was undertaken at all. Was it just to add visible bloodshed? Why didn't they just come up with a new story in which victims are mangled in graphic detail by Satanists instead of trashing what was and remains a masterpiece? In the hands of Roman Polanski, who adhered remarkably to the details of the original novel, ""Rosemary's Baby"" was an extraordinarily effective and subtle psychological thriller that actually made you think even as it more and more scared the bejeezus out of you. Agnieszka Holland, on the other hand, who directed this tasteless trash, has managed to transform it into just another gory slasher flick. No need to think, no need for innuendo, just buckets of blood to satisfy adolescent hunger for gross-out violence. Perhaps Holland should have renamed her hatchet-job ""Rosemary's Abortion.""",2,MISGUIDED REMAKE,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,2849,"['due', 'respect', 'reviewer', 'John', 'Bowen', 'one', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'person', 'who', 'remakes', 'find', 'one', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'Yes', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'acting', 'good', 'now', 'entirely', 'different', 'far', 'less', 'effective', 'movie.For', 'starters', 'pander', 'today', 'audiences', 'bloodlust', 'lot', 'graphic', 'gore', 'been', 'added', 'something', 'was', 'completely', 'absent', 'magnificent', 'original', 'instance', 'when', 'Rosemary', 'told', 'apartment', 'building', 'once', 'housed', 'notorious', 'Trench', 'Sisters', 'who', 'allegedly', 'indulged', 'cannibalism', 'instead', 'learning', 'casual', 'reference', 'conversation', 'original', 'here', 'have', 'be', 'subjected', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'showing', 'sisters', 'kill', 'graphically', 'dismember', 'man', 'blood', 'squirting', 'hatchet', 'hacking', 'off', 'arm', 'etc', 'where', 'Rosemary', 'friend', 'Hutch', 'who', 'warn', 'discreetly', 'off', 'camera', 'coma', 'original', 'teasingly', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'here', 'changed', 'now', 'investigative', 'police', 'officer', 'convulsions', 'car', 'blood', 'running', 'nose', 'being', 'squashed', 'bug', 'large', 'truck', 'pavement', 'giant', 'packet', 'ketchup', 'What', 'was', 'gained', 'More', 'detrimental', 'fact', 'remake', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'What', 'made', 'original', 'such', 'effective', 'chiller', 'was', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'ambiguous', 'up', 'end', 'viewer', 'version', 'piece', 'together', 'various', 'bits', 'evidence', 'same', 'time', 'Rosemary', 'so', 'share', 'gradual', 'discovery', 'growing', 'horror', 'remake', 'quickly', 'established', 'upfront', 'Castevets', 'are', 'evil', 'Satanists', 'who', 'have', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'can', 'grotesquely', 'kill', 'people', 'whim', 'do', 'several', 'additional', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'bloodshed', 'result', 'final', 'revelation', 'was', 'so', 'shocking', 'original', 'becomes', 'entirely', 'anticlimactic', 'almost', 'point.One', 'forced', 'ask', 'why', 'remake', 'was', 'undertaken', 'Was', 'just', 'add', 'visible', 'bloodshed', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'story', 'victims', 'are', 'mangled', 'graphic', 'detail', 'Satanists', 'instead', 'trashing', 'what', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'hands', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'who', 'adhered', 'remarkably', 'details', 'original', 'novel', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'effective', 'subtle', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'actually', 'made', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'more', 'scared', 'bejeezus', 'Agnieszka', 'Holland', 'other', 'hand', 'who', 'directed', 'tasteless', 'trash', 'managed', 'transform', 'just', 'gory', 'slasher', 'flick', 'No', 'need', 'think', 'need', 'innuendo', 'just', 'buckets', 'blood', 'satisfy', 'adolescent', 'hunger', 'gross-out', 'violence', 'Perhaps', 'Holland', 'should', 'have', 'renamed', 'hatchet-job', 'Rosemary', 'Abortion']",N/A

1697180,A146W4L7BDSL8V,B00KA0VE2S,J. Pizzuto,"[1, 3]","There are a few car accident scenes in this movie.  But in truth, the entire production is one mesmerizing car crash.There was no need to remake Rosemary's Baby.  I viewed the original for the first time two years ago, and it didn't seem so dated as to warrant a new version.  The original is a classic; this is forgettable.  What's worse, this version is very long.  In its television ""miniseries"" broadcast, it was split into two movie-length parts.  The only thing worse than a bad movie is a long bad movie.What's different between the two versions?  Plot-wise, not much at all.  Some of the few significant changes, though, are off the mark and only serve to distract the viewer.  First and foremost among them:  Rosemary is black!  Casting decided to fill the role memorably portrayed by Mia Farrow with a black actress that I've never heard of before...within a script that completely ignores the fact that she's black.  She and her white husband, Guy, are urban Americans residing in France, and yet Rosemary is the whitest American black woman next to Halle Berry:  soft-spoken, delicate, dainty, and actually emulative of Mia Farrow's depiction of the character, which this movie was reputedly meant to bring forward into the modern age.  Why?  What was the point?  By all means, there would be no problem with making her black, but at least allow the character to be informed by that identity.  Having her be black is also somewhat odd, though, since Rosemary isn't exactly the most common name given to urban black women.  It isn't as though they could have changed that detail, though, without changing the title of the movie.  At one point another character (Margaux) comments on the strangeness of her name, but only manages to respond to it by calling it ""feminine.""  As opposed to what?  All the butch girls' names out there?  Even the writers could sense that something was off, but they could barely put a finger on it, let alone offer a rebuttal.  How bizarre.Another change is the age of the main antagonists, the Castevets.  In the original, these were played by the elderly.  Here in the remake, the couple, Roman and Margaux, are middle aged.  This alteration is actually more of a problem than one might first think.  In both versions the Castevets have an ulterior motive for befriending Guy and Rosemary, but in the original this comes off as more plausible, as an old retired couple doting upon their younger neighbors.  Played by a younger couple, though, their interest in Guy and Rosemary is strikingly odd, so much so that a sane Guy and Rosemary should have been turned off by the scarcely warranted attention.  This is papered over by having Rosemary do a good deed for Margaux in returning her ""stolen"" wallet, but the scale of the favors that Margaux returns to her in exchange are glaringly lopsided (a cat, an apartment, a closet of fitted clothes, unyielding attention).  And this is all before Guy makes a deal with the devil.  It doesn't make sense.Rosemary has two advocates.  One is Julie, who is her peer (and, as the plot requires, a convenient expert on Coptic Christian trivia), and the other is police Commissioner Fontaine, who she meets initially at Roman's party.  This is also problematic, in that the incorruptible officer is introduced to the viewer in a venue otherwise populated by Roman's sycophantic satanists.  It would seem sloppy for Roman to have included him on the guest list.  Nonetheless, the script, actors, and director do a good job with these two characters, who are unique to the remake, and their inevitable death scenes are fun.All the other major plot points are straight out of the original movie, phoned in with little in the way of inspiration.  I think the only difference in the final ""cradle"" scene is that it's shot from the opposite end of the room from the original.  This movie is not up to the caliber of a truly good miniseries remake, such as Steven King's the Shining.  Despite its length, it brings nothing new to the table and fails to make a case for its needing to have been produced.",2,Throw this Out with the Bathwater,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,4076,"['are', 'few', 'car', 'accident', 'scenes', 'movie', 'truth', 'entire', 'production', 'one', 'mesmerizing', 'car', 'crash.There', 'was', 'need', 'remake', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'viewed', 'original', 'first', 'time', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'dated', 'warrant', 'new', 'version', 'original', 'classic', 'forgettable', 'What', 'worse', 'version', 'very', 'long', 'television', 'miniseries', 'broadcast', 'was', 'split', 'two', 'movie-length', 'parts', 'only', 'thing', 'worse', 'bad', 'movie', 'long', 'bad', 'movie.What', 'different', 'two', 'versions', 'Plot-wise', 'not', 'much', 'few', 'significant', 'changes', 'are', 'mark', 'only', 'serve', 'distract', 'viewer', 'First', 'foremost', 'Rosemary', 'black', 'Casting', 'decided', 'fill', 'role', 'memorably', 'portrayed', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'black', 'actress', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'script', 'completely', 'fact', 'black', 'white', 'husband', 'Guy', 'are', 'urban', 'Americans', 'residing', 'France', 'yet', 'Rosemary', 'whitest', 'American', 'black', 'woman', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'soft-spoken', 'delicate', 'dainty', 'actually', 'emulative', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'depiction', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'reputedly', 'meant', 'bring', 'forward', 'modern', 'age', 'Why', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'means', 'would', 'be', 'problem', 'making', 'black', 'least', 'allow', 'character', 'be', 'informed', 'identity', 'Having', 'be', 'black', 'also', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'though', 'Rosemary', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'most', 'common', 'name', 'given', 'urban', 'black', 'women', ""n't"", 'could', 'have', 'changed', 'detail', 'though', 'changing', 'title', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'Margaux', 'comments', 'strangeness', 'name', 'only', 'respond', 'calling', 'feminine', 'opposed', 'what', 'butch', 'girls', 'names', 'there', 'Even', 'writers', 'could', 'sense', 'something', 'was', 'off', 'could', 'barely', 'put', 'finger', 'let', 'alone', 'offer', 'rebuttal', 'How', 'bizarre.Another', 'change', 'age', 'main', 'antagonists', 'Castevets', 'original', 'were', 'played', 'elderly', 'Here', 'remake', 'couple', 'Roman', 'Margaux', 'are', 'middle', 'aged', 'alteration', 'actually', 'more', 'problem', 'one', 'might', 'first', 'think', 'versions', 'Castevets', 'have', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'befriending', 'Guy', 'Rosemary', 'original', 'off', 'more', 'plausible', 'old', 'retired', 'couple', 'doting', 'younger', 'neighbors', 'Played', 'younger', 'couple', 'though', 'interest', 'Guy', 'Rosemary', 'strikingly', 'odd', 'so', 'much', 'sane', 'Guy', 'Rosemary', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'off', 'scarcely', 'warranted', 'attention', 'papered', 'having', 'Rosemary', 'do', 'good', 'deed', 'Margaux', 'returning', 'stolen', 'wallet', 'scale', 'favors', 'Margaux', 'exchange', 'are', 'glaringly', 'lopsided', 'cat', 'apartment', 'closet', 'fitted', 'clothes', 'unyielding', 'attention', 'Guy', 'deal', 'devil', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.Rosemary', 'two', 'advocates', 'One', 'Julie', 'who', 'peer', 'plot', 'convenient', 'expert', 'Coptic', 'Christian', 'trivia', 'other', 'police', 'Commissioner', 'Fontaine', 'who', 'initially', 'Roman', 'party', 'also', 'problematic', 'incorruptible', 'officer', 'introduced', 'viewer', 'venue', 'otherwise', 'populated', 'Roman', 'sycophantic', 'satanists', 'would', 'seem', 'sloppy', 'Roman', 'have', 'included', 'guest', 'list', 'Nonetheless', 'script', 'actors', 'director', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'unique', 'remake', 'inevitable', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'other', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'straight', 'original', 'movie', 'phoned', 'little', 'way', 'inspiration', 'think', 'only', 'difference', 'final', 'cradle', 'scene', 'shot', 'opposite', 'end', 'room', 'original', 'movie', 'not', 'up', 'caliber', 'truly', 'good', 'miniseries', 'remake', 'such', 'Steven', 'King', 'Shining', 'length', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'make', 'case', 'needing', 'have', 'been', 'produced']",N/A
1697181,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00KA0VE2S,Kane's Review,"[8, 13]","I don't know if anyone remembers or knows of NBC's Sunday Night At The Movies series that ran from 1981 to 2000 but when the first half of this first aired on Sunday night on May 11th, I kind of felt like they were going a bit retro and I really enjoyed that. Sorry, I'm a big nostalgia fan!This 2 part mini-series remakes, stars Zoe Saldana as the soon to be trouble mother, Rosemary, while Patrick J. Adams stars as her husband, Guy.In this remake, Rosemary and Guy move from New York City to Paris, France and rent out an admirable apartment, looking to start their lives over together. Soon after they find comfort in locals and neighbors Roman and Margaux Castevet who become very involved in their lives. Rosemary ends up becoming pregnant, while Guy's career as a writer, elevates. Meanwhile, Guy's co-worker, Julie as well as Margaux begin spending a lot of time with Rosemary and Margaux informs Rosemary that herbs and holistics will help with her pregnancy.After Margaux performs a spell on soup that she was preparing for Rosemary, Rosemary's health declines in the worst way and she ends up in the hospital. After Rosemary miraculously recovers, she becomes suspicious of her doctor and the Castevets and feels that there's more to this evil French couple than they're letting on. After Rosemary discovers a shocking revelation about the apartment they're living in, its past, and an evil secret about Roman Castevet, she pleads with Guy to leave France but he thinks its all in her mind.Along the way, Rosemary's closest peers who get too closely bonded with Rosemary to try and help her, are met with unfortunate and gruesome deaths. Once Rosemary puts the pieces together, she realizes what the Castevets are up to and how her soon to be born baby is linked to Satan himself.Overall: Despite what the negative critics may say, this mini-series remake was a treat to watch. Unlike the movie, this setting takes place outside of the US and in France, which adds an overall exciting and different element with the characters involved in this. Because both 2 hour episodes equal 4 hours, you may tend to lose a bit of focus at times but it's not long before it grabs your attention again as the plot thickens and so do our characters. In addition, I was also expecting there to be quite a bit of controversy about Saldana playing the main character as Rosemary due to racial reasons, but fortunately, there were none....that I know of. Overall, you'll have to build up the courage to keep yourself watching this for 4 hours, otherwise you may lose interest in it. I can't speak for everyone, but I truly enjoyed this remake of the original and can't wait for it to be released on DVD",5,Amazing Remake Of The 1968 Classic,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,2695,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'remembers', 'knows', 'NBC', 'Sunday', 'Night', 'Movies', 'series', 'ran', '1981', '2000', 'when', 'first', 'half', 'first', 'aired', 'Sunday', 'night', 'May', '11th', 'kind', 'felt', 'were', 'going', 'bit', 'retro', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Sorry', ""'m"", 'big', 'nostalgia', 'fan', '2', 'part', 'mini-series', 'remakes', 'stars', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'soon', 'be', 'trouble', 'mother', 'Rosemary', 'Patrick', 'J.', 'Adams', 'husband', 'Guy.In', 'remake', 'Rosemary', 'Guy', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Paris', 'France', 'rent', 'out', 'admirable', 'apartment', 'looking', 'start', 'lives', 'together', 'Soon', 'find', 'comfort', 'locals', 'neighbors', 'Roman', 'Margaux', 'Castevet', 'who', 'become', 'very', 'involved', 'lives', 'Rosemary', 'up', 'becoming', 'pregnant', 'Guy', 'career', 'writer', 'Meanwhile', 'Guy', 'co-worker', 'Julie', 'as', 'well', 'Margaux', 'begin', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'Rosemary', 'Margaux', 'informs', 'Rosemary', 'herbs', 'holistics', 'will', 'help', 'pregnancy.After', 'Margaux', 'spell', 'soup', 'was', 'preparing', 'Rosemary', 'Rosemary', 'health', 'declines', 'worst', 'way', 'up', 'hospital', 'Rosemary', 'miraculously', 'recovers', 'suspicious', 'doctor', 'Castevets', 'feels', 'more', 'evil', 'French', 'couple', ""'re"", 'letting', 'Rosemary', 'discovers', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'apartment', ""'re"", 'living', 'past', 'evil', 'secret', 'Roman', 'Castevet', 'Guy', 'leave', 'France', 'mind.Along', 'way', 'Rosemary', 'closest', 'peers', 'who', 'get', 'too', 'closely', 'bonded', 'Rosemary', 'try', 'help', 'are', 'met', 'unfortunate', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'Once', 'Rosemary', 'pieces', 'together', 'what', 'Castevets', 'are', 'up', 'how', 'soon', 'be', 'born', 'baby', 'linked', 'Satan', 'himself.Overall', 'what', 'negative', 'critics', 'may', 'say', 'mini-series', 'remake', 'was', 'treat', 'watch', 'movie', 'setting', 'place', 'US', 'France', 'overall', 'exciting', 'different', 'element', 'characters', 'involved', '2', 'hour', 'episodes', 'equal', '4', 'hours', 'may', 'tend', 'lose', 'bit', 'focus', 'times', 'not', 'long', 'attention', 'again', 'plot', 'thickens', 'so', 'do', 'characters', 'addition', 'was', 'also', 'expecting', 'there', 'be', 'quite', 'bit', 'controversy', 'Saldana', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'Rosemary', 'due', 'racial', 'reasons', 'fortunately', 'were', 'none', '.that', 'know', 'Overall', ""'ll"", 'have', 'build', 'up', 'courage', 'keep', 'watching', '4', 'hours', 'otherwise', 'may', 'lose', 'interest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'everyone', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'remake', 'original', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'released', 'DVD']",N/A
1697182,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00KA0VE2S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 11]","Roman Polanski's 1968 version of ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a true classic by any definition and a horror film that still holds up for modern viewers.  It placed #9 on the American Film Institute's Most Thrilling American Films roster, garnered Polanski an Oscar nod for Best Screenplay and even won Ruth Gordon a golden statuette for Best Supporting Actress.  Remarkably vivid for its day, the tale is an escalating ride of paranoia, menace, and ultimate dread.  The film, adapted from a novel by Ira Levin, is stamped by Polanski's indelible mark.  So let's just get this out of the way, the TV two-parter of ""Rosemary's Baby"" doesn't try to emulate Polanski's film so much as it is another adaptation of Levin's source material.  While it relocates the story to Paris, the new interpretation of ""Rosemary's Baby"" stays closer to the roots of the novel on which it was based.  As a product for a different medium in a different time, I'm not concerned with comparing the two versions.  The only comment I'll make is that the original film was fairly startling and explicit for a Hollywood film (with an A-list cast, no less) in 1968 while the story is not nearly as shocking almost 30 years later when we've seen countless films borrow heavily from the same type of plotting.The miniseries opens with a grim sequence depicting a young woman plummeting to her death.  Soon thereafter, we meet our young heroes (the appealing Patrick J. Adams and Zoe Saldana) as they acclimate to their new Paris digs.  Having suffered a deep tragedy, the lovely pair are trying for a fresh start in the City of Lights.  He's an aspiring writer joining the faculty of a Parisian college, she's a former ballerina content to spend her time in cooking classes.  A series of events put the duo into the orbit of an upscale couple played by Carole Bouquet and Jason Isaacs.  The elder couple insinuate themselves into the lives of their young proteges and things start to feel slightly uneasy.  It's all a little too close for comfort, in my opinion.  Of course, when they offer them the apartment in which the woman from the opening died--you know things can't stay blissful for long.  Soon Adams and Isaacs are fast friends and all of the writer's dreams start to come true.  But at what price?  By the end of Part One, Rosemary is pregnant which leaves Part Two open to unraveling the mysteries of the impending birth.I won't reveal any major spoilers although I feel like the story is largely given away in descriptions and promos.  Suffice it to say, many of the major players have ulterior motives and the baby is the ultimate prize.  I think locating the tale in Paris was a great idea that gives us a fresh spin on the classic story.  But with the extra time (without the commercial breaks, this still pulls in at about three hours), the adaptation feels a little padded and flat.  I wanted the extra time to enrich the story, not water down its impact.  It's all well done from a technical standpoint and the piece even has the terrific director Agnieszka Holland (love Europa Europa) at the helm, but something feels like it's missing.  And when I really scrutinize this version, it comes down to the character of Rosemary.The performances are fine.  Adams (great in Suits) has a nice change of pace, Bouquet is deceptively off-kilter (although Ruth Gordon killed this role), and Isaacs is always reliable.  Truthfully, I'd watch Isaacs in just about anything!  Mostly, though, this piece rests on Saldana's shoulders.  I'm a big fan of Saldana, but I never felt like her Rosemary seemed very modern.  In 1968, Rosemary would be a lot less independent and gullible.  It seems less likely now, especially as they established Rosemary as someone who had been supporting the family on her dance salary.  As presented, she just bends to the whims of everyone around her and it's a little strange to see.  Essentially Rosemary is a victim, but I'd have liked to see a bit of re-imaging in this modern interpretation.  Overall, I've heard people completely dismiss ""Rosemary's Baby"" as unnecessary rubbish.  Others boldly proclaim it is a great film.  I'm in the middle ground.  It's fine to pass the time, but almost instantly forgettable.  If you watched any of last season's 666 Park Avenue, this just seemed like an extension of that type of TV horror.
