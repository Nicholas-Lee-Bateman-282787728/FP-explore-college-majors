1461814,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B005IF7AZK,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[2, 2]","What a great way to share Earth Day 2012 with your children. Travel with Sammy the cutest sea hatchling who along the way teaches children about the life of a sea turtle. As Sammy struggles to survive in the vast ocean he finds a friend and they head off on a mission. As they swim thought the beautiful ocean they come across environmental pollution, natural predators and Sammy learns the true meaning of love and friendship.Featuring voices by such stars as Tim Curry, Melanie Griffith, Kathy Griffin, Stacy Keaton, Anthony Anderson and Jenny McCarthy, A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventure is the story of a turtle hatchling born on a California Beach in 1959. Over the next 50 years this cute little turtle has numerous adventures that take him around the world. Along the way he is befriended by hippies and encounters natural predators, pollution and Japanese whalers.I like how the environmental scenarios in this film were kept light and are not overbearing for young children. Teaching very young children about the importance of protecting our oceans without scaring them. This along with the film being a short 88 minutes makes it an ideal film for very young children who have a short attention span. Yet the film is fun to watch and I recommend it for all ages. I found myself rooting for Sammy to catch up with and find his life-mate. The music was fun and had us all singing along with The Mamas & The Papas to California Dreaming and other songs.Our family loved this film and my 10 year old raved about it, which left me surprised.  As a family we gave this movie 4 stars. I would of liked to have given it 5 stars, but as a family we thought the graphics could have used some improvement.",4,A unique fun under sea experience with subtle environmental lessons.

1461834,AHF97M45JFCB,B005IF7AZK,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","I've long supported the theory that in the realm of computer animated features, underwater reigns supreme! Beginning with Pixar's Finding Nemo and then taking into consideration DreamWorks' Shark Tale, the list goes on to include The Reef 1 & 2, Dolphin: The Story of a Dreamer, Legend of the Sea, Sea Level, Back to the Sea and a pair of Turtle Tales (the sequel to this one is set to be released in July, 2013).  While I can only suppose the reason this genre is so popular stems from the fact that we live in a world that's 75% water and, well, there's plenty of fish in the sea.Bad puns aside, A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures (also known as Sammy's Adventures: The Secret Passage) is a 2010 Belgian animated film produced in English.  It comes in at a runtime of 88-minutes and is unrated though really there's nothing here that would prevent it from getting the G-rating that Finding Nemo enjoys.You'll note I mentioned that it was produced in English- this is important because films originally recorded in a foreign language that come across the pond only to get slapped with an English dub track are more often than not exercises in disaster with mismatched mouth flaps, painfully stiff conversation flow and absolutely no comedic timing.  Take comfort in knowing Studio Canal avoids any such snafus here.The story here centers on the exploits of a sea turtle (Sammy) who embarks upon a journey that will take him around the world and back to the beach where he was born.  The film opens with narration by William Hurt as old turtle-Sammy on the very beach he was hatched several decades earlier.  While crowded and populated now, his flashback to his own hatching reveals a much more clean and serene beach and thus sets off both a theme of things to come and a journey which could well have been called ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" had Lemony Snickett not beaten these guys to the punch.Make no mistake, the backstory of a single turtle's journey from hatching to finding a mate to returning to the beach of hatching to see his grandkids off to a life at sea is certainly decent but prepare for a near constant succession of setbacks and crises, most of which are a direct result of humanity's influence over nature.Before sliding below the waves, Sammy makes a lifetime friendship with Leatherback Ray (Anthony Anderson).  From there it's our first taste of humanity's negative touch in the form of an oil spill.  Netting, illegal whaling, pollution, the film quickly runs the gamut of negativity but all hope isn't lost once Sammy encounters the hippie Snow (Melanie Griffith), her cat, Fluffy (Tim Curry), and slightly older female green turtle Vera (Kathy Griffin).While the script is never razor-sharp or overly clever, it's passable enough for adults, who will likely find enjoyment in watching the slow changes of society throughout the span of the film (Sammy is supposed to have been born in 1959).  Kids however will likely delight in the clean, colorful visuals and fleshed out characters to be offended by the oft heavy handed themes of environmentalism present here.In all, A Turtle's Tale certainly succeeds in providing an hour & a half of family-friendly entertainment (be forewarned the domestic release contains nothing in the way of special features- not even a commercial in the beginning).  The lack of cleverness will certainly keep it from infringing upon Pixar's territory but solid visuals and a bit educational value should hold the interest of the younger ones.  The soundtrack is also noteworthy for its attempt to chronicle the given eras of the film with contemporary musical entries.It may be true that A Turtle's Tale fails to tread on Pixar or DreamWorks' supremacy of the medium, it should also be noted that it was considered successful enough to warrant a sequel.

1461839,AS6SH2JM2YY3H,B005IF7AZK,R S Cobblestone,"[0, 4]","A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures is, well, a cute film.  Sammy hatches out of his egg and has a difficult time getting to the ocean.  Once there, he doesn't seem to like the water very much, preferring to ride on some flotsam.  He makes a friend, Ray, and they both float around, with Sammy eating plants and Ray eating jellyfish (he's a leatherback, but this is never mentioned).  Continuing adventures center around sharks, oil spills, trawl nets, pollution, environmentalists, whaling, friendship, and romance.You never really get to understand that sea turtles are air breathers (that's why they drown when caught in nets), that they'll eat plastic or tar balls, that even large sea turtles can be found missing flippers due to sharks, that sea turtles don't mate for life, and that they don't visit both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and they certainly cannot survive anywhere close to Antarctica.  And papa turtle NEVER watches over the hatchlings.  Mama doesn't either.  Of course, when sea turtles can talk to whales and cats and seabirds, but not people, you should recognize that it is a fantasy.On the positive side, the reefs are fantastic. Beautiful.  So if you want a cutesy tale for the young ones, okay.  But if you want something with a bit more pizzaz, I'd suggestTurtle: The Incredible Journeyfor a turtle film, andFinding Nemofor a really cute film with undersea adventures (and adventures in a dental office!).",2,"Cute, but don't expect to learn anything about sea turtles!",1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,1436,"['Turtle', 'Tale', 'Sammy', 'Adventures', 'well', 'cute', 'film', 'Sammy', 'egg', 'difficult', 'time', 'getting', 'ocean', 'Once', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'water', 'very', 'much', 'preferring', 'ride', 'flotsam', 'friend', 'Ray', 'float', 'around', 'Sammy', 'eating', 'plants', 'Ray', 'eating', 'jellyfish', 'leatherback', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Continuing', 'adventures', 'center', 'sharks', 'oil', 'spills', 'trawl', 'nets', 'pollution', 'environmentalists', 'whaling', 'friendship', 'romance.You', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'understand', 'sea', 'turtles', 'are', 'air', 'breathers', 'why', 'drown', 'when', 'caught', 'nets', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'plastic', 'tar', 'balls', 'even', 'large', 'sea', 'turtles', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'missing', 'flippers', 'due', 'sharks', 'sea', 'turtles', 'do', ""n't"", 'mate', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'visit', 'Pacific', 'Atlantic', 'oceans', 'certainly', 'can', 'not', 'survive', 'anywhere', 'close', 'Antarctica', 'papa', 'turtle', 'NEVER', 'hatchlings', 'Mama', ""n't"", 'either', 'course', 'when', 'sea', 'turtles', 'can', 'talk', 'whales', 'cats', 'seabirds', 'not', 'people', 'should', 'recognize', 'fantasy.On', 'positive', 'side', 'reefs', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Beautiful', 'So', 'want', 'cutesy', 'tale', 'young', 'ones', 'okay', 'want', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'pizzaz', ""'d"", 'suggestTurtle', 'Incredible', 'Journeyfor', 'turtle', 'film', 'andFinding', 'Nemofor', 'really', 'cute', 'film', 'undersea', 'adventures', 'dental', 'office']",A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures

It shows sammy the turtle from hatching out of his egg and the obsticles he has to over come to get from his egg to the water, and all the other ocean creatures he comes in contact with while trying to find his mate, shelly who he has loved sinced he was a hatchling.
