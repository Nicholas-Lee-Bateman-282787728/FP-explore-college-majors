1396154,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,B004CJQVHQ,Brian,"[2, 3]","Not to put too fine a point on it, as these aren't exactly art films, but it's fairly clear that 'Death Wish' 2-4 actually were shot with the intention of being shown in a 1.33:1 format (TV/video-market friendly for the time; see IMDB's production specs) and later were matted for theatrical release, so the old fullscreen DVDs by MGM are not pan-and-scan and rather offer a noticeably larger picture-- that is, one which includes everything the director meant for the lens to capture-- than the widescreen versions that appear on this TGG set. By contrast, the original 'Death Wish' (arguably the best in the series, as the plotlines and Kersey's motivations wear increasingly thin in the sequels), like the majority of big-studio movies since the mid-1950s, was shot for widescreen consumption, so a fullscreen print of it would be considered generally undesirable as it either would have to be cropped on the sides to fit a standard screen or would include areas the director had designated to be blocked out (for boom mikes, shadows, extraneous movement, etc.). While there's certainly no harm in wanting to have the later DWs cut, as they are here, to resemble their theatrical aspect ratios, in these atypical cases I think it's preferable to have more picture than less; in other words, MGM had it right the first time.",3,Fullscreen vs. widescreen: an unusual case...,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,1326,"['Not', 'put', 'too', 'fine', 'point', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'art', 'films', 'fairly', 'clear', 'Wish', '2-4', 'actually', 'were', 'shot', 'intention', 'being', 'shown', '1.33:1', 'format', 'TV/video-market', 'friendly', 'time', 'see', 'IMDB', 'production', 'specs', 'later', 'were', 'matted', 'theatrical', 'release', 'old', 'fullscreen', 'DVDs', 'MGM', 'are', 'not', 'pan-and-scan', 'rather', 'offer', 'noticeably', 'larger', 'picture', 'one', 'everything', 'director', 'meant', 'lens', 'capture', 'widescreen', 'versions', 'appear', 'TGG', 'set', 'contrast', 'original', 'Wish', 'arguably', 'best', 'series', 'plotlines', 'Kersey', 'motivations', 'wear', 'increasingly', 'thin', 'sequels', 'majority', 'big-studio', 'movies', 'mid-1950s', 'was', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'consumption', 'fullscreen', 'print', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'generally', 'undesirable', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'cropped', 'sides', 'fit', 'standard', 'screen', 'would', 'include', 'areas', 'director', 'had', 'designated', 'be', 'blocked', 'out', 'boom', 'mikes', 'shadows', 'extraneous', 'movement', 'etc.', 'certainly', 'harm', 'wanting', 'have', 'later', 'DWs', 'cut', 'are', 'here', 'resemble', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratios', 'atypical', 'cases', 'think', 'preferable', 'have', 'more', 'picture', 'less', 'other', 'words', 'MGM', 'had', 'right', 'first', 'time']",N/A

Turner ""Idiots with guns make me ner...","[9, 9]","First and foremost, do NOT buy the MGM dvds for Death Wish 2, 3, and 4 individually because they are all in full screen.  This set however, all three movies are in widescreen.All three films are on one disc, and the disc isn't double-sided either, so all three movies are on one side.  You'd think there would be compression issues with quality, but I didn't notice any.  As far as I noticed, all three films are mono sound, and the dvd is otherwise barebones, excluding even trailers, but the films themselves are presented in good widescreen and that's all that should matter.As a movie, Death Wish 2 is good. About on par with the first film.  Death Wish 3 is excellent, with a lot more action and good story development.  Death Wish 4 is fairly standard, but you can't go wrong with Charles Bronson.An important thing to note is the sound. I read other reviews saying that there were sound issues on part 4 claiming it goes out of sync halfway through, but I just watched the film and there were NO problems in that department.

No trailers, no audio commentaries, no previews, no interviews, no nuttin'. Just the movies themselves, and that is pretty much what is to be expected.The old Blockbuster video guides panned these pictures, and I no longer allow their opinions to drive my taste in film collecting/viewing. However, in terms of this series, their reviews are mostly dead on. Bronson really doesn't react much in these movies, he merely responds. Like Clint Eastwood, he is not much of an actor, but he is a tremendous presence, and that presence is nearly lost here. These films really do feel like fly-by-night screenplays. My problem here is that the original film was NOT an action movie, but in the sequels, they've drained these characters of all feeling and mystery and replaced them with ultra-violent contexts. I have no idea if a study of film history will find any use for these pictures; &#34;Death Wish 3&#34; is really repugnant, and &#34;Death Wish 4&#34; is a going-through-the-motions affair, not passionate, not logical in the slightest. While I can understand someone having Bronson's reaction to having a loved one assaulted and/or killed, it's a good thing not everyone grieves in the way that he does or we would have several wars going on in the streets! Of course, these films are really fantasies more than realistic commentaries upon social problems, but even in this context of revenge-fantasy storytelling the movies are not really successful. Bronson meanders through each performance instead of using his facial features to grand effect like he did in the original. While other reviewers are right that &#34;Death Wish 2&#34; is the best film of the lot, by the end we are left asking, what's the point? If you watch and own the original &#34;Death Wish&#34; film, you pretty much have all you need of this show.I keep wondering about how Brian Garfield feels about these sequels, because his original story (for the original film) was so altered for the film version that he is probably embarrassed that these works are so tightly connected with his cinematic legacy. While charlatans were busy working on the fourth film, Garfield was busy working on a great under-appreciated film like &#34;The Stepfather&#34;, a very scary movie that is better than any of this dreck here. So, while I don't like to under-value the B-movie/exploitation aesthetic, and while I don't like the Blockbuster or Maltin guides much any more, these two films are known for their intentional flouts of quality, which has, unfortunately, had such a strong influence upon the meat-headed marketplace of today. What happens to Bronson's family is very sad, and he should be more devastated than he seems here, and the sequels seem to have forgotten that his family has been killed, along with every other love of his life. By the time of &#34;Death Wish IV: the Crackdown&#34; it's like we are watching a different character completely, in a completely unrelated story. With all of this death and tragedy, why are viewers saying that these films are not drama? No wonder Garfield finds the intellectual hijacking of these properties so hard to take, because the sequels have all become action pieces instead of great serious dramas that they should have been. Oh well, some people seem to enjoy them--but you have to do so on a very simple-minded level.

1396173,A2XHAPXNOFRXMK,B004CJQVHQ,TC,"[0, 2]","A good buy but only if you are a serious Charlie Bronson fan.But these three sequels, however, were not as good as the original Death Wish.You can see the decline in quality and entertainment value as the sequel number gets higher.Death Wish 2 was OK. It is basically a version of Death Wish but in LA.In Death Wish 3 Charlie Bronson's character is visiting an inner city neighborhood to help out a friend.The residents of this inner city neighborhood  eventually join together with Charlie Bronson in a final bigshoot out with a gang of street punks. The neighborhood becomes a war zone with lots of property damageand some dead bodies on both sides. The police mostly just drive around the neighborhood and try not toget in the way of all the shooting until the good guys win.For Death Wish 4 Bronson's character doesn't seem to have a regular job anymore. I guess he's afull time Vigilante now.  In DW4 our hero gets tricked into starting a mobster gang warand now has to clean things up to restore the rule of law.Death Wish 4 was a bad movie.  It is what you expect from a classic B-movie. If you have neverseen this movie, you didn't miss out on anything worthwhile.",3,The three Death Wish sequels - my review,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,1172,"['good', 'buy', 'only', 'are', 'serious', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'three', 'sequels', 'however', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Death', 'Wish.You', 'can', 'see', 'decline', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'value', 'sequel', 'number', 'higher.Death', 'Wish', '2', 'was', 'OK', 'basically', 'version', 'Death', 'Wish', 'LA.In', 'Death', 'Wish', '3', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'character', 'visiting', 'inner', 'city', 'neighborhood', 'help', 'out', 'friend.The', 'residents', 'inner', 'city', 'neighborhood', 'eventually', 'join', 'together', 'Charlie', 'Bronson', 'final', 'bigshoot', 'gang', 'street', 'punks', 'neighborhood', 'war', 'zone', 'lots', 'property', 'damageand', 'dead', 'bodies', 'sides', 'police', 'mostly', 'just', 'drive', 'around', 'neighborhood', 'try', 'not', 'toget', 'way', 'shooting', 'good', 'guys', 'win.For', 'Death', 'Wish', '4', 'Bronson', 'character', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'regular', 'job', 'anymore', 'guess', 'afull', 'time', 'Vigilante', 'now', 'DW4', 'hero', 'tricked', 'starting', 'mobster', 'gang', 'warand', 'now', 'clean', 'things', 'up', 'restore', 'rule', 'law.Death', 'Wish', '4', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'what', 'expect', 'classic', 'B-movie', 'have', 'neverseen', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'anything', 'worthwhile']",N/A
