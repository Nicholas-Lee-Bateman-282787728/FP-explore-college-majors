1093740,ARTQMPY28XYYS,B000U788X4,Lisa L. Burkett,"[0, 0]","A decent adaptation of the history of the explosion, and the effect of war on communities. There are some sexual themes and language, as well as some moderately graphic scenes (parents beware). I felt that the graphic content was tastefully handled to bring across the horrors of war, especially in contrast to the ignorance of communities that were far removed from the fighting. The thing that was not as well represented as it could have been was the rash of fires that broke out as a result of overturned coal stoves. The film focuses more on the explosion debris and blizzard that slowed recovery and rescue operations, but big fires were also part of the problem, especially since the new fire truck and its crew were lost on the pier when the explosion occurred. I am not as well versed in this portion of nautical history as in others, but from what I know of it, the film is not entirely accurate, but Janet Kitz and other more informed people could shed better light on the film's authenticity. One moment that was a genuine treat might be considered a little mocking, though I don't think it was at all meant that way. It could not have been an accident that the boatman who pulls up next to the fiery Mont Blanc was...well, Red Green fans will get it. &#34;Ka-boom!&#34; Apart from the explosion, though, I think the film seeks to foster a greater appreciation for the common soldier and what the price of freedom really is. That is what I liked best about the lead character.",4,GOOD FILM,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,1488,"['decent', 'adaptation', 'history', 'explosion', 'effect', 'war', 'communities', 'are', 'sexual', 'themes', 'language', 'as', 'well', 'moderately', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'parents', 'beware', 'felt', 'graphic', 'content', 'was', 'tastefully', 'handled', 'bring', 'across', 'horrors', 'war', 'especially', 'contrast', 'ignorance', 'communities', 'were', 'far', 'removed', 'fighting', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'represented', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'rash', 'fires', 'broke', 'out', 'result', 'overturned', 'coal', 'stoves', 'film', 'more', 'explosion', 'debris', 'blizzard', 'slowed', 'recovery', 'rescue', 'operations', 'big', 'fires', 'were', 'also', 'part', 'problem', 'especially', 'new', 'fire', 'truck', 'crew', 'were', 'lost', 'pier', 'when', 'explosion', 'occurred', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'versed', 'portion', 'nautical', 'history', 'others', 'what', 'know', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'Janet', 'Kitz', 'other', 'more', 'informed', 'people', 'could', 'shed', 'better', 'light', 'film', 'authenticity', 'One', 'moment', 'was', 'genuine', 'treat', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'little', 'mocking', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'way', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'accident', 'boatman', 'who', 'up', 'next', 'fiery', 'Mont', 'Blanc', 'was', 'well', 'Red', 'Green', 'fans', 'will', 'get', '34', 'Ka-boom', '34', 'Apart', 'explosion', 'think', 'film', 'foster', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'common', 'soldier', 'what', 'price', 'freedom', 'really', 'what', 'liked', 'best', 'lead', 'character']",Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion
