For as much as Tommy Johnston should be credited for the Doobies' sound, so should Michael.

The Doobies July, 2004, concert at Virginia's Wolf Trap has it all!The Doobies have always been my favorite band and I have everything they're ever done, but I was blown away by this great DVD. This concert is far superior to the other Doobie DVD, ""Rockin' Down the Highway - The Wildlife Concert"". Renditions of old Doobie favorites are terrific and the musical talent that these men have glows prominently.  Versatile John McFee demonstrates his range by playing about 5 different guitar types ranging from pedal steel to acoustic.  He's great on the fiddle as well!  Pat Simmons and Tom Johnston show their musical range as well and sound better than ever on every song!  Bass player Skylark carries the rhythm and energy of this concert.  Drummers Keith Knudson and Mike Hossack provide the depth and beat that they're long known for.  And the addition of the horn section, led by saxophonist Marc Russo, adds new punch to the favorite songs that Doobie fans know so well!Clocking in at a minute over two hours, the Brothers entertain the crowd the entire time with absolutely no downtime.  Twenty-plus favorites from the past are offered by the Doobs on this great DVD.  ""Don't Start Me Talkin"", ""Little Bitty Pretty One"", and staples like ""Listen To the Music"", ""China Grove"", and ""Long Train Runnin"" carry the freight during the concert, but the listener won't be disappointed with any song!If you're a fan of the Doobie Brothers, you absolutely have to add ""Live At the Wolf Trap"" to your musical collection!",5,Hard to find anything you won't like as the Doobies rock Wolf Trap,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1697,"['Great', 'songs', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'talent', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'quality', 'watch', 'Hi-Def', 'unbelievable', 'clarity', 'terrific', 'interaction', 'crowd', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Doobies', 'July', '2004', 'concert', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'Trap', 'Doobies', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'band', 'have', 'everything', ""'re"", 'ever', 'done', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'great', 'DVD', 'concert', 'far', 'superior', 'other', 'Doobie', 'DVD', 'Rockin', 'Down', 'Highway', 'Wildlife', 'Concert', 'Renditions', 'old', 'Doobie', 'favorites', 'are', 'terrific', 'musical', 'talent', 'men', 'have', 'glows', 'prominently', 'Versatile', 'John', 'McFee', 'range', 'playing', 'about', '5', 'different', 'guitar', 'types', 'ranging', 'pedal', 'steel', 'acoustic', 'great', 'fiddle', 'as', 'well', 'Pat', 'Simmons', 'Tom', 'Johnston', 'show', 'musical', 'range', 'as', 'well', 'sound', 'better', 'ever', 'song', 'Bass', 'player', 'Skylark', 'rhythm', 'energy', 'concert', 'Drummers', 'Keith', 'Knudson', 'Mike', 'Hossack', 'provide', 'depth', 'beat', ""'re"", 'long', 'known', 'addition', 'horn', 'section', 'led', 'saxophonist', 'Marc', 'Russo', 'new', 'punch', 'favorite', 'songs', 'Doobie', 'fans', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'Clocking', 'minute', 'two', 'hours', 'Brothers', 'entertain', 'crowd', 'entire', 'time', 'absolutely', 'downtime', 'Twenty-plus', 'favorites', 'past', 'are', 'offered', 'Doobs', 'great', 'DVD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Start', 'Me', 'Talkin', 'Little', 'Bitty', 'Pretty', 'One', 'staples', 'Listen', 'Music', 'China', 'Grove', 'Long', 'Train', 'Runnin', 'carry', 'freight', 'concert', 'listener', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'song', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'absolutely', 'have', 'add', 'Live', 'Wolf', 'Trap', 'musical', 'collection']",N/A

Why would you supplant guitars for saxaphones? ""South City Midnight Lady"" (an excellent song) sounded really bizarre with it's use of steel guitar and saxaphone. Maybe it's just me, but I've never been a fan of the sax and think it has ruined many a good song. And to hear the sax and the steel used in the same song is..well it's just wrong. Over all, this is an excellent DVD. The sound and camera use is great, and the band (a rather large band) is in top form. The Doobie's versatility has never failed to amaze me, and this concert has it in spades. Lap steel, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, pedal steel,fiddle, it's all there, and done very well.

This concert includes 23 songs and is beautifully mastered in both sound and cinematography.  It is without a doubt, the Doobie Brothers' finest performance ever.  In one of the special feature interviews, Tom Johnston states, ""we practice alot these days.""  Well, Mr. Johnston, it shows.  Every song is played tightly and precisely yet mingled with an easiness and playfulness that can only come from professionals who have honed their craft to perfection.  The Doobie Brothers were awesome in the 70's but in my opinion, have only recently reached the pinacle of music success with this DVD.  Other 70's bands seem to have declined through the years but, not the Doobies.  They have aged like fine wine.

859075,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B00064AEHY,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[3, 3]","In the 70's, I only heard a handful of Doobie Brothers songs.  I liked ""Long Train Runnin'"" (in spite of the fact that in gym class, I heard it 5 times daily for a month while the girls' P.E. class learned pom pom routines to it).  I was not as much of a fan of the other songs I knew were by them, that is, ""Black Water"" and ""It Keeps You Running"" (which is not on this project).Let's jump ahead close to twenty years later.  I heard a song by DC Talk called ""Jesus Is Just Alright By Me"", and loved it.  Then, I discovered the Doobies were the original artists.  I didn't really like the original as much as the remake, and I filed that in another reason I wasn't a Doobie fan.  (I still wonder if that song originally was a profession of faith in Christ or just a comment that Jesus loves everyone and don't judge me by what I do.)Another decade plus later, I heard ""China Grove"", ""Taking It To The Street"", and ""Listen To The Music"", and starting liking them better.  (I also changed my mind on ""Black Water"".)  As a result, I checked out this DVD.  I watched the whole concert and the interviews.  I'm now a Doobie fan.One thing that positively impressed me is that this band both enjoyed playing and seemed to enjoy working together.  In the interviews, they mentioned they work as a democracy, and it shows.  They also shared the joy to the audience:  I loved the audience participation encouraged on ""Black Water"", ""Long Train Runnin'"", and ""Listen To The Music"".  Another is the eclectic influences; there were individual songs that could be called soul, country, blues, and rock.  I enjoy this unique sound.Let me compare the teamwork with a couple of other videos I saw.  Talking Heads is technically a four person band, and on ""Stop Making Sense"" had an additional fivesome, but it clearly came across as David Byrne and his back-up.  With the Doobies, Pat and Tom dominated the talking but they definitely shared the wealth.  Also, I saw a Neil Diamond video recently, in which Neil didn't introduce the band (except for the female background singer, and that was because they did a duet), and the band was listed at the end of the credits after everything else.  With the Doobies, the band was the first one listed.  (One side note:  Though the music is different, and though what I said above is better pictured by the Doobies, the Go Go's live concert available on VHS and DVD captures the same joy and team spirit, though drummer Gina Shock didn't seem happy in it.)",5,Not A Doobie Fan In The '70's; That's No Longer True,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,2483,"['70', 'only', 'heard', 'handful', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'songs', 'liked', 'Long', 'Train', 'Runnin', 'spite', 'fact', 'gym', 'class', 'heard', '5', 'times', 'daily', 'month', 'girls', 'P.E', 'class', 'learned', 'pom', 'pom', 'routines', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'fan', 'other', 'songs', 'knew', 'were', 'Black', 'Water', 'Keeps', 'Running', 'not', 'project', '.Let', 'jump', 'ahead', 'close', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'heard', 'song', 'DC', 'Talk', 'called', 'Jesus', 'Just', 'Alright', 'Me', 'loved', 'Then', 'discovered', 'Doobies', 'were', 'original', 'artists', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'original', 'as', 'much', 'remake', 'filed', 'reason', 'was', ""n't"", 'Doobie', 'fan', 'still', 'wonder', 'song', 'originally', 'was', 'profession', 'faith', 'Christ', 'just', 'comment', 'Jesus', 'everyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'what', 'do', 'decade', 'later', 'heard', 'China', 'Grove', 'Taking', 'Street', 'Listen', 'Music', 'starting', 'liking', 'better', 'also', 'changed', 'mind', 'Black', 'Water', 'result', 'checked', 'out', 'DVD', 'watched', 'whole', 'concert', 'interviews', ""'m"", 'now', 'Doobie', 'fan.One', 'thing', 'positively', 'impressed', 'band', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'working', 'together', 'interviews', 'mentioned', 'work', 'democracy', 'also', 'shared', 'joy', 'audience', 'loved', 'audience', 'participation', 'encouraged', 'Black', 'Water', 'Long', 'Train', 'Runnin', 'Listen', 'Music', 'eclectic', 'influences', 'were', 'individual', 'songs', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'soul', 'country', 'blues', 'rock', 'enjoy', 'unique', 'sound.Let', 'compare', 'teamwork', 'couple', 'other', 'videos', 'saw', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'technically', 'four', 'person', 'band', 'Stop', 'Making', 'Sense', 'had', 'additional', 'fivesome', 'clearly', 'came', 'David', 'Byrne', 'back-up', 'Doobies', 'Pat', 'Tom', 'dominated', 'talking', 'definitely', 'shared', 'wealth', 'Also', 'saw', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'video', 'recently', 'Neil', 'did', ""n't"", 'introduce', 'band', 'female', 'background', 'singer', 'was', 'did', 'duet', 'band', 'was', 'listed', 'end', 'credits', 'everything', 'else', 'Doobies', 'band', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'listed', 'One', 'side', 'note', 'music', 'different', 'what', 'said', 'above', 'better', 'pictured', 'Doobies', 'Go', 'Go', 'live', 'concert', 'available', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'same', 'joy', 'team', 'spirit', 'drummer', 'Gina', 'Shock', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'happy']",N/A

I was so glad to find that they are not only still touring, but also still making great new music.  To me, it doesn't matter what sound they had.  I know that members have come and gone throughout the years (as Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons stated) but the guys still have it.  I too was wondering about why Michael MacDonald wasn't featured here.  One thing I'm sick of hearing from people who claim to be ""dedicated fans"" of the group is that they hated the music they did with Michael MacDonald.  Yes the sound was a little different, but Michael got the band to win a Grammy.  I was also wondering what happened to bassist Tiran Porter.  But I saw Skylark's ambition and was floored.

Gone is the delightful menu presented by the band members on the original DVD, and I couldn't access the five icons in the lower left corner during certain songs which on the original DVD would take you briefly behind the scenes to see how the writers were inspired. So if you still have your DVD of this concert, it might be worth hanging on to. Nevertheless, if it's just about the concert (and it mainly is as far as I'm concerned), this blu ray really brings out the clarity of those high definition cameras you probably noticed on the DVD, so this is still a worthy upgrade. Tom Johnston admits they never sounded this good way back when, as I too would attest, after seeing their poor performance in Frankfort Kentucky during their ""Vices"" tour in the 70's.To the dismay of some fans (and the delight of others), this concert is more or less a representation of their pre-Michael McDonald years with a couple or so exceptions, such as ""Takin' It To The Streets"", voiced very nicely by Simmons in his stead. The infinitely versatile McFee is a valuable asset to this lineup (Hossack and Knudsen have since passed away so it's nice to have this to remember them by). At least the half hour documentary remains intact, so you're not missing much from the original DVD here. A more comprehensive history that includes the very talented Michael McDonald can be found on the other blu ray that is now out (Let The Music Play). Yes, the MM years were good years too and I still treasure many of those songs as well. This show however is the way they sounded at the beginning, so ""listen to the music"".
