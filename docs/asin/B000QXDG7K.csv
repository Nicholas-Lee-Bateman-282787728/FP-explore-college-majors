1078265,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B000QXDG7K,E. David Swan,"[3, 4]","My biggest complaint about anime is that 95% of it is extremely derivative as if it's all drawn from the same general template then modified slightly. Too often they have an assembly line feel to it. Unfortunately Naruto is guilty of this sin with a definite lack of originality about it. I liked the look of the snow ninja's but their boss is a totally unoriginal stock anime villain and the story is rather unremarkable. Overall the animation is fairly good but it's not going to win any awards.This is my first experience with the very popular Naruto series so I'm reviewing this based on complete ignorance of the characters. As I said earlier it bears more than a passing resemblance to dozens of other series like Dragon Ball Z and Full Metal Alchemist. Naruto himself is a likable character with an indomitable spirit although the voice acting can get grating particularly when he's pontificating about never giving up. Naruto's never say die attitude is his defining characteristic but at some point it can get to be a bit much. After about the dozenth time of him saying he'll never give up I started to get a bit numb to it.When you get right down to it the showpiece for anime like Naruto is the action and this film has one spectacular fight scene. This battle takes place about halfway through the film and I was hoping for another great fight but the final climax wasn't nearly as exciting. Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow seems to be aimed directly at teenagers and younger which makes it more surprising that a scene later in the movie displays a shocking amount of blood, violence and death.Naruto will likely appeal to a younger audience who haven't already seen this same story played out dozens of different times in other anime. For older audiences I would suggest the wonderful series Cowboy Beebop or give Paprika or Tekkon Kikreet a try.",3,Better Than Average But Nothing Spectacular,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,1861,"['biggest', 'complaint', 'anime', '95', '%', 'extremely', 'derivative', 'drawn', 'same', 'general', 'template', 'then', 'modified', 'slightly', 'Too', 'often', 'have', 'assembly', 'line', 'feel', 'Unfortunately', 'Naruto', 'guilty', 'sin', 'definite', 'lack', 'originality', 'liked', 'look', 'snow', 'ninja', 'boss', 'totally', 'unoriginal', 'stock', 'anime', 'villain', 'story', 'rather', 'unremarkable', 'animation', 'fairly', 'good', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'awards.This', 'first', 'experience', 'very', 'popular', 'Naruto', 'series', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'based', 'complete', 'ignorance', 'characters', 'said', 'earlier', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'dozens', 'other', 'series', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'Naruto', 'likable', 'character', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'voice', 'acting', 'can', 'get', 'grating', 'particularly', 'when', 'pontificating', 'about', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'Naruto', 'never', 'say', 'die', 'attitude', 'defining', 'characteristic', 'point', 'can', 'get', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'dozenth', 'time', 'saying', ""'ll"", 'never', 'give', 'up', 'started', 'get', 'bit', 'numb', 'it.When', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'showpiece', 'anime', 'Naruto', 'action', 'film', 'one', 'spectacular', 'fight', 'scene', 'battle', 'place', 'halfway', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'great', 'fight', 'final', 'climax', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'exciting', 'Ninja', 'Clash', 'Land', 'Snow', 'be', 'aimed', 'directly', 'teenagers', 'younger', 'more', 'surprising', 'scene', 'later', 'movie', 'shocking', 'amount', 'blood', 'violence', 'death.Naruto', 'will', 'likely', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audience', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'same', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'dozens', 'different', 'times', 'other', 'anime', 'older', 'audiences', 'would', 'suggest', 'wonderful', 'series', 'Cowboy', 'Beebop', 'give', 'Paprika', 'Tekkon', 'Kikreet', 'try']",NARUTO The Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
1078266,A29GGWB3GGQBO9,B000QXDG7K,GPeralta,"[27, 29]","With the latest anime movies I've seen before this being made in the mid-nineties, I had some low expectations when I ordered this from amazon. But I guess anime movies have come a long way since '95!STORYIn a nutshell, Naruto and his squad are assigned the task of guarding an actress during the filming of her latest movie. But like all Naruto characters, this actress has some skeletons in her closet and it was only a matter of time until her past catches up with her.The movie keeps the general flair of the series without getting too caught up in stuff like fight scenes. Like it's canon series counterpart, this movie does a good job of things like good back-stories and character development.My only nitpicky complaint about the movie itself is that you could tell that the writers were trying to cram in every awesome attack there was available to the according characters (Kakashi and Sasuke's sharingan; Naruto's Mass Shadow Clones; even Sakura's evil side near the start of the movie!). The character designs for the bad guys and other movie-only characters are also not the best (the Princess' is probably the best out of all the new characters), but their back-story and weird quirks definitely make up for this.Amazingly enough, this movie also fits in well into the series (as far as I know). Naruto's flashback in the series and Sasuke still being there shows that the movie is around the time right after Tsunade arrives in the village.TECHNICAL STUFFAs for the animation, you can definitely tell that the movie got the royal treatment in that department. You can especially tell during the chidori/wolf scene. And, of course, like all current animated shows, the picture quality is beautiful. The background music also keeps most of the more memorable music from the series as well as some new tracks of their own.One thing I was worried about when ordering this DVD was it's aspect ratio. See, the movie was originally filmed to be shown in theaters, so the aspect ratio is widescreen. Again, rest assured, that this release has the widescreen version as well, as opposed to being cropped to fit full screen TV monitors. And to make matters better, it's in anamorphic widescreen, meaning that if you've got a widescreen TV, the footage will automatically fit to the size of the screen (as in, without the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen). A much better option than the alternative of setting up your widescreen TV to zoom in to remove the black bars, but keeping the rest of the picture, since that would in turn cut off part of the subs and make the picture slightly fuzzy.LANGUAGE TRACKSUpon getting the movie today, I was most worried about the movie only having the dubbed version. Rest assured that there is a subbed Japanese version available. Now, I have close to no knowledge on the Japanese language, but it looks like the only changes made sub-wise were done for the sake of ""American-izing"" it (ie: having the subs read the first name before the last name and excluding suffixes like ""-san"" and ""-chan"") But nothing major.And for those interested in the dub, based on the one scene I've seen of it, it looks like they've done a good job keeping close to the script and only making some changes for the sake of making the prose flow better and for the mouth movements to match up.It definitely would have helped if they pointed out that both the dub and sub were available on the box art. Upon buying this, I was completely freaking out about whether this release had both versions or not!EXTRASNo way I would have given this release the full five stars if it didn't have at least one legit special feature-- a 10-ish minute short featuring Naruto and most of the other genin. The story's basically about Konohagakure holding a little tournament among the younger ninja. The only problem is that poor ol' Naruto's constipated and is forced to hold it in for the entire tournament.The short is also available in dub and sub and is in widescreen, so I'm assuming this was played before the actual movie when shown in theaters in Japan (kinda like Pikachu's Vacation playing before the Pokemon movie). My only complaint with this is that unlike the movie itself, this short is NOT anamorphic, so your options to watching the sub while maintaining its aspect ratio (on a widescreen TV) are limited to 4:3 (full screen). Either that or you can have the screen stretch out or zoom in to remove those darn black bars. The problem with zooming in is that this means the subs will also be cut off slightly since well... it's not anamorphic. A slight pain, but still worthy of five stars.WHY BUY IT?You may be one of those fans who've downloaded this movie before Viz came around to distribute it here in the US... so you may be asking why you should buy it in the first place? Well, the way I see it, you're basically hurting the well being of the series if you don't! Downloading the episodes while they're available is one thing, but you should show your love for the series by buying the official releases once they're available on DVD. It's also always good to have a hard copy outside of your computer.In conclusion, ""Naruto The Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Show"" is definitely worth the purchase, whether you're a subtitle or an English dub kind of fan. It's everything a fan would expect from the series meshed together into an hour and 35 minute movie.",5,Anime Movies Have Come a Long Way...,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,5401,"['latest', 'anime',

1078268,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000QXDG7K,Lesley Aeschliman,"[4, 4]","Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow is the first theatrical film in the Naruto franchise.  It's a good film; however, it was definitely written in a way where you already had to be familiar with the Naruto anime series in order to fully understand what was going on.  No time was used for any kind of exposition to explain some of the things that are common knowledge from the series.The menu on the first disc allows you to watch the film, set up your audio and subtitle preferences, select which scene from the film that you'd like to see, and special features.  For the audio options, there is English 5.1, English Stereo, and Japanese Stereo.  For subtitles, you can choose whether to have them on or off.  In the Special Features menu, you have six options.  You can watch the ""Konoha Annual Sports Festival"" short (which preceded the film when it was shown in Japanese movie theaters), you can see the English trailers for the film, you can see trailers for four Viz Media releases, you can see ads for Shonen Jump manga, a screen promoting Toonami Jetstream, and the trailers for several Naruto videogames.The second disc in the set includes seven special features.  ""Behind the Scenes of U.S. Voice Recording"" is a 20-minute documentary which includes interviews with the Production Manager, ADR directors, and some of the voice actors; you also get to see the voice actors dubbing some of their dialogue for the film.  The second feature is a 10-minute feature which includes interviews with the Japanese voices for Sasuke, Naruto, and Kakashi; this feature is subtitled.  Next is a five-minute feature that includes messages from the ADR Directors, the U.S. voice cast, the Japanese voice cast, and a text message from Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of the Naruto manga.  Next is the seven-minute feature, ""Inside the Animation Studio.""  It is narrated by the U.S. voice actor for Kakashi, and it shows the animation process that the film underwent in Japan from the character sketches to the final rendered product.  Then, an almost eight-minute feature about Naruto at the 2007 New York Comicon is next; it includes interviews with several people involved with the dubbing of the series, as well as some footage from the actual con.  This is followed by the original Japanese movie trailers.  This feature runs for about five minutes and includes ten trailers; unfortunately, it is not subtitled.  The final extra is the original Japanese credits.  It's basically the last five-and-a-half minutes of the film, and does not include subtitles.The third disc is a CD soundtrack for Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow.  There are twenty instrumental tracks, and the disc is 29 minutes in length.If you're a Naruto fan, then this film needs to be in your DVD collection.  However, I would recommend getting the deluxe edition DVD if you can.In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD set through the King County Library System.",4,This is a pretty good film,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,2984,"['Naruto', 'Movie', 'Ninja', 'Clash', 'Land', 'Snow', 'first', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Naruto', 'franchise', 'good', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'definitely', 'written', 'way', 'where', 'already', 'had', 'be', 'familiar', 'Naruto', 'anime', 'series', 'order', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'was', 'used', 'kind', 'exposition', 'explain', 'things', 'are', 'common', 'knowledge', 'series.The', 'menu', 'first', 'disc', 'watch', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'audio', 'subtitle', 'preferences', 'select', 'scene', 'film', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'audio', 'options', 'English', '5.1', 'English', 'Stereo', 'Japanese', 'Stereo', 'subtitles', 'can', 'choose', 'have', 'off', 'Special', 'Features', 'menu', 'have', 'six', 'options', 'can', 'watch', 'Konoha', 'Annual', 'Sports', 'Festival', 'short', 'preceded', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'theaters', 'can', 'see', 'English', 'trailers', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'trailers', 'four', 'Viz', 'Media', 'can', 'see', 'ads', 'Shonen', 'Jump', 'manga', 'screen', 'promoting', 'Toonami', 'Jetstream', 'trailers', 'several', 'Naruto', 'videogames.The', 'second', 'disc', 'set', 'seven', 'special', 'features', 'Scenes', 'U.S.', 'Voice', 'Recording', '20-minute', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'Production', 'Manager', 'ADR', 'directors', 'voice', 'actors', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'voice', 'actors', 'dubbing', 'dialogue', 'film', 'second', 'feature', '10-minute', 'feature', 'interviews', 'Japanese', 'voices', 'Sasuke', 'Naruto', 'Kakashi', 'feature', 'subtitled', 'Next', 'five-minute', 'feature', 'messages', 'ADR', 'Directors', 'U.S.', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'text', 'message', 'Masashi', 'Kishimoto', 'creator', 'Naruto', 'manga', 'Next', 'seven-minute', 'feature', 'Animation', 'Studio', 'narrated', 'U.S.', 'voice', 'actor', 'Kakashi', 'animation', 'process', 'film', 'underwent', 'Japan', 'character', 'sketches', 'final', 'rendered', 'product', 'Then', 'almost', 'eight-minute', 'feature', 'Naruto', '2007', 'New', 'York', 'Comicon', 'next', 'interviews', 'several', 'people', 'involved', 'dubbing', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'footage', 'actual', 'con', 'followed', 'original', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'trailers', 'feature', 'five', 'minutes', 'ten', 'trailers', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'subtitled', 'final', 'extra', 'original', 'Japanese', 'credits', 'basically', 'last', 'five-and-a-half', 'minutes', 'film', 'not', 'include', 'subtitles.The', 'third', 'disc', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'Naruto', 'Movie', 'Ninja', 'Clash', 'Land', 'Snow', 'are', 'twenty', 'instrumental', 'tracks', 'disc', '29', 'minutes', 'length.If', ""'re"", 'Naruto', 'fan', 'then', 'film', 'be', 'DVD', 'collection', 'However', 'would', 'recommend', 'getting', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'DVD', 'can.In', 'order', 'write', 'review', 'checked', 'out', 'copy', 'DVD', 'set', 'King', 'County', 'Library', 'System']",NARUTO The Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow

I love Naruto, and I have never seen the English version (I saw the Japanese version back in 2006 at a screening at Animethon 13), but having seen the original Japanese version I must admit I was kind of dissapointed in the movie, but I still thought it was OK.Naruto has been stalking a princess actress after being ""moved by her performance"" in THE NINJA STORY OF THE SNOW PRINCESS, a movie to which a sequel is being made. Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke (our heroes of the day) travel with the film's crew to the Snow country to shoot the movie, and Naruto must protect the princess the whole way.That's pretty much all I'll give away of the plot, since the plot is a HUGE part of the movie.I must say, as a Naruto fan, I am kind of dissapointed. I thought this movie would be much better. It had a very good first half, which was followed by a very lackluster second half. Meanwhile we do get great action scenes, we get lots of plot holes too; not to mention the derivativeness (sp?) in the plot (The King Kong-style ""Movie"" subplot, the ""Total Recall""-like ending, etc.).

I am also surprised about some character omissions (Rock Lee not being in this for instance, My favorite character!!!!)And I couldn't believe this movie was only 84 minutes long, it felt like FOREVER.The 2nd movie is coming out next year, I hope to attend the screening if there is one (which I'm hoping there is).

While the animation and overall story were entertaining enough the personality of the actress that Naruto is forced to protect makes her so unlikable I truly wished that the villains would kill her in the most gruesome way conceived.  The producers made her character as unlikable as Prince Hikaru from the third movie,  they try and give her a more tragic past and the reason for her apathetic attitude but overall you just don't care anymore about her and are left wondering why Naruto just doesn't leave her to be killed off but than that wouldn't be Naruto for you.  The voice cast were done very well though for both the subbed and dubbed so no complaints on that though the music soundtrack for the subbed and dubbed was a little different and you'll notice when you watch the scenes if you switch between the two audios.  So while the movie overall is entertaining to watch just expect your annoyance to grow as you also have to deal with the unlikable actress that Team 7 is forced to deal with as well....",4,An Enjoyable Naruto Movie But The Princess Needs A Kick To The Head And Die,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,1364,"['little', 'third', 'Naruto', 'movie', 'Naruto', 'Team', '7', 'Sasuke', 'Included', 'are', 'hired', 'protect', 'famous', 'highly', 'overrated', 'apathetic', 'actress', 'journey', 'filming', 'newest', 'movie', 'way', 'discover', 'hidden', 'secret', 'charge', 'find', 'assignment', 'become', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'first', 'thought', 'animation', 'overall', 'story', 'were', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'personality', 'actress', 'Naruto', 'forced', 'protect', 'so', 'unlikable', 'truly', 'wished', 'villains', 'would', 'kill', 'most', 'gruesome', 'way', 'conceived', 'producers', 'made', 'character', 'as', 'unlikable', 'Prince', 'Hikaru', 'third', 'movie', 'try', 'give', 'more', 'tragic', 'past', 'reason', 'apathetic', 'attitude', 'overall', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'Naruto', 'just', ""n't"", 'leave', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Naruto', 'voice', 'cast', 'were', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'so', 'complaints', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'was', 'little', 'different', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'when', 'watch', 'scenes', 'switch', 'two', 'audios', 'So', 'movie', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'just', 'expect', 'annoyance', 'grow', 'also', 'have', 'deal', 'unlikable', 'actress', 'Team', '7', 'forced', 'deal', 'as', 'well']",NARUTO The Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow

Now having seen all 220 episodes I have moved up to Shippuden and decided I would check out the Naruto (Original) movies so I ordered this one. And it was $20 well spent not only does it come with a awesome movie but a 10(ish) minute short that is pretty funny, but the bonus go further still behind the scenes with the US voices, Animation Studio featurette, Very cool art cards.
