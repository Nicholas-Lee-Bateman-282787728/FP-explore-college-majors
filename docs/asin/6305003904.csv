The main character is a single mother/street vendor who starts out as a very unlikeable woman. She's loud, obnoxious, and guilty of practically prostituting her 15-year old daughter to a horny older man who takes an interest in her. Her daughter tells her she hates her, going so far as to accuse her of not caring about her children.This seems like a turning point in the mother's life. To earn extra money for her family, she begans dancing in the local dance hall. At night, she transforms herself into a dancing diva. Nobody has a clue that she's the sloppy looking street vendor selling beer in the neighborhood. To add to the conflict, she has two evil men who have wronged her (I won't spoil it by saying why).  She shrewdly plays them against each other and uses her charms to eliminate both of them from her life.  In the end, her daughter finds out her secret identity, and she cheers her mom on. This was a story of transformation, redemption, and second chances.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a story with a different twist.",5,Dazzlingly Different,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,1237,"['Sometimes', 'Jamaican', 'dialect', 'was', 'difficult', 'understand', 'had', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'based', 'plot', 'message', 'inspiration', 'main', 'character', 'single', 'mother/street', 'vendor', 'who', 'out', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'woman', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'guilty', 'practically', 'prostituting', '15-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'horny', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'interest', 'daughter', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'accuse', 'not', 'caring', 'children.This', 'turning', 'point', 'mother', 'life', 'earn', 'extra', 'money', 'family', 'dancing', 'local', 'dance', 'hall', 'night', 'dancing', 'diva', 'Nobody', 'clue', 'sloppy', 'looking', 'street', 'vendor', 'selling', 'beer', 'neighborhood', 'add', 'conflict', 'two', 'evil', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'wronged', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'saying', 'why', 'shrewdly', 'other', 'charms', 'eliminate', 'life', 'end', 'daughter', 'out', 'secret', 'identity', 'mom', 'was', 'story', 'transformation', 'redemption', 'second', 'chances', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'story', 'different', 'twist']",N/A

443521,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6305003904,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","This movie is something else. When this was released in 1997, ""Dancehall Queen"" created a sensation in Jamaica, eventually surpassingHarder They Come (Deluxe Edition)as the highest-grossing film in that country's history. I remember enjoying this film when it first came out on tape and before hand created a lot of buzz. Once I'd purchased it I'd also pass it along to my friends at the time and found it very entertaining. Just recently watching this the other day gave me a great sense of recollection on how much I enjoyed ""Dancehall Queen.""  Like the dancehall music on its soundtrack, ""Dancehall Queen"" has a rough, self-produced feel disguised by a technically proficient coating. Utilizing elements of techno, rap, and reggae, dancehall combines technologically advanced production techniques with unmistakably Jamaican source material.To lesser effect, ""Dancehall Queen"" does the same thing as a film. Shot on digital video, which makes everything look like a British soap opera, the film concerns the struggle of a Kingston street vendor (Audrey Reid) trying to raise two children on her own. After being continually harassed by a knife-wielding thug and, in a disturbing sequence of events, encouraging her 15-year-old daughter to accept the advances of a middle-aged sugar daddy, Reid realizes that she needs to find a way out of poverty. Naturally, her mind turns to the dancehall, and she soon finds herself joining barely clad Kingston youths in a style of dance that blurs the line between dancing and performing sexual acts. Although the question of how Reid expects to make money simply by going to clubs isn't answered until near the movie's end, it's pretty clear from the beginning that ""Dancehall Queen"" is an old-fashioned melodrama sure to culminate in the all-important big show. You'll be mesmerize by the clothes and the wigs that these women sport. The score itself is really good featuring Beenie Man (who provides the title track), Bounty Killer, Lady Shaw, Junior Demus and Sanchez.Taken as such and enhanced by its Jamaican setting, it's not terrible, and it does feature a guest appearance by Beenie Man. But, despite being bankrolled by Island Records, it was clearly made on the fly, and the rough edges show. As you view this the upbeat dancehall style is catchy and infectious, and the dancing scenes will certainly hold your attention and probably be part of the reason why its like so much.",4,Old Fashion  movie made straight from the heart.,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,2429,"['movie', 'something', 'else', 'When', 'was', 'released', '1997', 'Queen', 'created', 'sensation', 'Jamaica', 'eventually', 'Come', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'highest-grossing', 'film', 'country', 'history', 'remember', 'enjoying', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'tape', 'hand', 'created', 'lot', 'buzz', 'Once', ""'d"", 'purchased', ""'d"", 'also', 'pass', 'along', 'friends', 'time', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Just', 'recently', 'watching', 'other', 'day', 'gave', 'great', 'sense', 'recollection', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Dancehall', 'Queen', 'dancehall', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Queen', 'rough', 'self-produced', 'feel', 'disguised', 'technically', 'proficient', 'coating', 'Utilizing', 'elements', 'techno', 'rap', 'reggae', 'dancehall', 'combines', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'production', 'techniques', 'unmistakably', 'Jamaican', 'source', 'material.To', 'lesser', 'effect', 'Queen', 'same', 'thing', 'film', 'Shot', 'digital', 'video', 'everything', 'look', 'British', 'soap', 'opera', 'film', 'struggle', 'Kingston', 'street', 'vendor', 'Audrey', 'Reid', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'children', 'own', 'being', 'continually', 'harassed', 'knife-wielding', 'thug', 'disturbing', 'sequence', 'events', 'encouraging', '15-year-old', 'daughter', 'accept', 'advances', 'middle-aged', 'sugar', 'daddy', 'Reid', 'find', 'way', 'poverty', 'Naturally', 'mind', 'dancehall', 'soon', 'joining', 'barely', 'clad', 'Kingston', 'youths', 'style', 'dance', 'line', 'dancing', 'performing', 'sexual', 'acts', 'question', 'how', 'Reid', 'make', 'money', 'simply', 'going', 'clubs', ""n't"", 'answered', 'movie', 'end', 'pretty', 'clear', 'beginning', 'Dancehall', 'Queen', 'old-fashioned', 'melodrama', 'sure', 'culminate', 'all-important', 'big', 'show', ""'ll"", 'be', 'mesmerize', 'clothes', 'wigs', 'women', 'sport', 'score', 'really', 'good', 'featuring', 'Beenie', 'Man', 'who', 'title', 'track', 'Bounty', 'Killer', 'Lady', 'Shaw', 'Junior', 'Demus', 'Sanchez.Taken', 'such', 'enhanced', 'Jamaican', 'setting', 'not', 'terrible', 'feature', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Beenie', 'Man', 'being', 'bankrolled', 'Island', 'Records', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'fly', 'rough', 'edges', 'show', 'view', 'upbeat', 'dancehall', 'style', 'catchy', 'infectious', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'will', 'certainly', 'hold', 'attention', 'probably', 'be', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'much']",N/A

443527,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,6305003904,Unlucky Frank,"[2, 2]","Wow!! Yes, mon. One of the best films to come out of Jamaica, seen. Obviously made by the same folks who gave us THIRD WORLD COP. Some of the same great actors are in this too. I liked that film, but this one is better. A single woman named Marcia with two kids and her brother, Junior get mixed up with the rude bwoy element on the tough streets of Kingston. The only way this woman can free herself from the hopelessness of poverty, murder, revenge, and pedophilia is to become a scantily clad Boogle dancer. To win a man? Or to win fame and money? I'm not quite sure. You see, this flick is filled with fast talking heavy Jamaican Patois which makes it hard for a 46 year old white bwoy from Cali to get all in one sitting. Even though, I've been a reggae fan for over 35 years and a dreadie for 12 years. Now, jus' a bal'head.You might be asking, wha a gwan? What a Boogle, mon? Picture da tall hot black gal dressed inna next-to-nothin' gold lame and a purple wig doing obscene pornographic strip club pole dancing and you get da picture, seen. What next? Full insertion on the dance floor? Rude bwoys gwan luv dis. This film is not for the batty bwoy.The film is billed as a comedy. And it is funny. But in a demented way.What a gwan, Star. Audrey Reid as Marcia. Carl Davis as da blood clat rapist. And da great Paul Campbell as da wicked Priest. Also da great Mark Danvers as Madman Junior. Some Golden Bwoy performances, ya know.If you've never been to Jamaica and want to see how the other half lives, dis film a must see. This is the Third Otherworldy. And if you want to see what's become of Marley's beloved reggae culture, this is a must see. What used to be a music of respect and love has been taken over mostly by slackness(naughtiness), gangster hierarchy, and gun culture. Like misogynistic gangster rap in the States. Only more fun. If you love dancehall reggae, you're gonna love this movie. The music is the cream of crop. The soundtrack and performers are some of the best. And Bennie Man is featured in the film. Him a burn tha place down. If you like this movie you're gonna want the soundtrack. I'm gonna look for it now. I hope it's as good as the THIRD WORLD COP soundtrack.One thing that did surprise me is that there are no spliffs or hard drugs potrayed at all in this movie. Unusual and not quite reality.Jamaicans are some of the greatest people on the face of this planet. But this film will show you why Jamaica is not the safest place to take the kids on vacation anymore. A lot of hedonism and bumba clat cocaine don business taking over. Big time!! This is what happens when the poor can't take no more. The movie is pure entertainment and a blast for adults. But, I wouldn't show this to the kids. Me no know if it subtitled.
