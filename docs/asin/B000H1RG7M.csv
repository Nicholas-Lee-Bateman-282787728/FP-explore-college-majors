1009067,A76YYKY2IKTH4,B000H1RG7M,A. Hutto,"[0, 0]","This is an interesting 1 star show. its weird how it earns one star. in some areas the overall plot is interesting enough. the mysteries that must be solved can be good but other times are solved in terrible super cop syndrome. the show has much potential but just ends up failing. had this show had writers and not monkeys with type writers it would of been gold as the main premise is rather good and a mystery show is rare enough that they can be quite entertaining.that said on with the bad. for starters the characters are basically one dimensional and from start to finish act out exactly how they would from episode 1(or whenever you first meet them) to the finish. despite Ayume helps the blade children repeatedly they all constantly tell him to but out despite dragging him into the mess in the first place. one of the blade children is OCD about another one called Eyes. two of the others are OCD for each other. Ayumes side kick girl is the same annoying person from start to finish and is in love with him from start to finish. to prove she does not change at all. in a later episode where Ayume is depressed she continues to babble on about food(she loves food), walking around and the weather and it takes all day for her to finally blurt out something is wrong with him. he gets stubborn(like in every episode) so instead of proving she cares she simply says to paraphrase the Ayume i know is in there somewhere so when you find him tell him to believe in himself(she says this at least once an episode) and walks away instead of acting like a friend all day she remains the selfish pointless idiot she is from start to finish. She also inexplicably sings some weird song every episode which is called a weird song every episode. the last 6 minutes of the entire Anime is where they finally show mild character changes so sorry that doesnt count as character growth and plot writing.there also seems to be no real reason anyone is chasing the main characters. Ayume or Little Narumi as he is called is chased by the blade children because he is the key to their salvation....fair enough. except that is never answered.why is he the key to their salavation?who is Ayume's older brother that gets mentioned 10 times per episode? despite his rampant repeated mentioning you are not once told who he is or why anyone should care. yet all the blade children seem to worship him as some sort of God or prophet.who are the blade children? this is asked another 10 times per episode yet not once gets answered. at best you discover they are missing a rib....are cursed(what kind of curse goes unanswered)....and have hunters chasing them(again why hunters chase them and what are these hunters gets completely unanswered)also why do the characters tend to repeat similar dialogue and in some cases the exact same words each freakin episode? also why do the characters go through the exact same motions in every single episode?we also then have the last 2-3 episodes which border on idiotic. after yet another trap and series of mazes and mysteries. the blade children confront and kill a hunter after trying to save the hunters life because saving the guy trying to kill you makes sense. as he falls to his death he rambles on about how the blade children are cursed(SHOCKING I KNOW...only the 456345646th time that is ever said in this anime) and how they need to be sent back to the darkness or something. this inexplicably shocks EVERYONE. the next episode everyone is in some sort of depression over this startling revelation which makes 0 sense since they have all said it at least 1000 times per episode. so under what planet is this shocking enough to cause a deep depression by everyone?then we have the ending episode. where Ayume who is sherlock holmes and super cop mixed into one. if youve seen sherlock holmes and watched any cop show in the past 10 years you will know those cops go into super cop mode and make weird psychotic jumps in logical conclusions to get an outcome. Ayume is both mixed into one. needlessly to say there is no mystery or trap he cannot think his way out of. that said at the end after beating the last villian in one last insane maze three plotholes happen1. he escapes and grabs his jacket that he has previously burned into ashes.2, he grabs a giant stuffed animal out of his pocket that goes unnoticed until this point because a giant stuffed animal is easily jammed into your pocket3. when he is free he actually says ""he cant do anything"". SERIOUSLY???? you are super cop + sherlock holmes and even before this final seen manages to make a crazy jump onto a boat leaping at least 3 feet into the air. and you cant do anything? ok yea sure buddy.i will also say i didnt buy the complete series. i bought the indivual DVD cases seperately as they were cheap and on sale. and bought the final two i was missing on amazon. that said there is no way in this seperate DVD cases to tell the order of the discs. you have to look this up online. hey a mystery show with a mystery order on the discs yay.there is also the main menu of each DVD. first there is a two minute unskippable AD to an anime. secondly is the menu itself. which is laid out like this:progressionratiosskewexponentsok what is this? and who it made it and why? i really want to slap the person that made this menu. progression starts the episodes. one of those has to do with audio and subtitles. the other two i dont remember because it makes no sense. speaking of subtitles the first 5 discs have three subtitle options. the last one inexplicably has only two. i watched the first five discs with subtitle option two turned on but for the last disc that option was now subtitle option 1 because why not? i dont know it made 0 sense like this entire anime.from the disc menu(seriously how do you mess up the disc menu????) to storyline to the finish this show fails.",1,a mystery show on repeat that solves none of its own mysteries,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,5882,"['interesting', '1', 'star', 'show', 'weird', 'how', 'one', 'star', 'areas', 'overall',

1009068,A130YN8T37O833,B000H1RG7M,"Always Samsung ""ravereviews""","[6, 11]","Im writing this review based on the first 3 episodes ive seen so far. This is a great series, i love the music that they have placed through out each episode, the music only draws you into the mystery even more. The theme song & ending theme song is not all that. I like a series with a good theme & ending song. Like Sailormoon, Utena, and Magic Knight Rayearth. The voice acting is fine, nothing 2 rave about. The best anime that had the best voice acting would have 2 be Utena. Anyways this is a good series and i brought the box set on a splurge type of motive because i had a giftcard & i wanted 2 enjoy a new series. So i decided to pick this one up. I dont regret it all. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because i didnt finish the series yet and the fact that from everyone elses review, you dont ever find out who the Blade Children are in the final episode. It only leaves you with more question marks at the end. Buy it, you will totally enjoy it.

1009069,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000H1RG7M,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[4, 4]","So just who are the Blade Children, why are they cursed, and what does our hero have to do with all this?Those questions lie at the heart of ""Spiral,"" an intricate mystery series with solid animation, a compellingly dark mystery.... and no ending. Despite a distinct lack of answers at the finale, it is a solid anime, with well-drawn characters, amazing art and some nail-biting suspense during a few of these arcs.Two years ago, Ayumu Narumi got a phone call from his older, genius brother Kiyotaka. He announced he was investigating the ""Blade Children,"" and then vanished.Much later, a girl named Sayoko falls from a balcony -- and Ayumu seems like the only possible suspect, even though the police inspector is his sister-in-law Madoka. But Ayumu has the same astounding analytical skills as his older brother, and he soon solves a pair of crimes connected to Sayoko -- her fall, and a locked-room murder -- only to find that they both involve the Blade Children.Unfortunately, the Blade Children are getting interested in Ayumu -- first a ""smart bomb"" is planted in a piano concert, and then a weird boy lures Ayumu to an abandoned school, playing a deadly game with the young genius. And after a teacher is murdered, Ayumu is pulled into a deadly mind game with a precocious Blade Child. She sabotages his self-esteem, and then snares him into a deadly cat-and-mouse game.But even as Ayumu outwits the Blade Children, he learns that another deadly faction is involved with the Blade Children -- the Hunters, who kill them and anyone they are allied with. Even worse, he has a new enemy among the Blade Children -- Kanone, a young man who believes that the Blade Children ""must not live."" And since Ayumu may be their only hope, he is now Kanone's enemy...""Spiral"" starts delving into the mystery of the Blade Children literally from the first scene, with Kiyotaka's parting words. Those expecting lots of action, slapstick and flashy superspecial powers will probably be bored by this smarter brand of anime: the confrontations usually end in nothing more spectacular then a scuffle, and the only special powers Ayumu has are his intellectual ones.While the writers don't really reveal much, they do spin a web of clever, intellectual mysteries, with magic squares, explosive neckwear, bombs, mystery future killings, card tricks and an abandoned hotel rigged with explosives all throughout it. Some of these are pretty hard to figure out, despite their simplicity.And when Ayumu isn't pondering mysteries, the episodes are peppered with comedy (in one scene, Hiyono keeps distracting Ayumu as he tries to get an arcade toy for her) and flashbacks that show the characters' pasts. And though we don't find out what the problem with the Blade Children is, the episodes are infused by a sense of ominous hopelessness, but you never quite pity them yet because of their casual brutality.There are a few problems, though -- for one thing, the second half of the series seems much more dependent on big kabooms than simple mind games and murders. The mindwork is still there, but not as prominent. And... there's no ending. We never learn what the Blade Children are, where they came from, or why the Hunters hate them so.Daniel Kats&uuml;k does an excellent job with both Ayumu's laid-back, unemotional demeanor, and his inner turmoil. While it's hard to really be sympathetic to someone who has so many natural gifts, he makes it understandable that Ayumu would feel so inferior to his seemingly perfect brother. Caitlin Glass' Hiyono is rather annoying and hyperactive (""Thank you God, for blessing us with these awesome seats""), but Gwendolen Lau is excellent as the gutsy, vulnerable Madoka.And the voicework for the Blade Children is pretty uniformly excellent -- John Burgmeier and Greg Ayres are excellent as the melancholy Eyes Rutherford and the devilish Kousuke. Laura Bailey is excellent as the gutsy runner Ryoko, and Monica Rial is solid as the girlish, ruthless Rio. I'm not sure if Kanone is supposed to have that brick-thick Southern accent, though.""Spiral"" winds into a mystery that it never really leaves, but the intricate storyline and suspense are definitely worth checking out. A nice series if you don't mind finding the end elsewhere.",4,Unwind the Spiral,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,4261,"['So', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'Blade', 'Children', 'why', 'are', 'cursed', 'what', 'hero', 'have', 'do', 'questions', 'lie', 'heart', 'Spiral', 'intricate', 'mystery', 'series', 'solid', 'animation', 'compellingly', 'dark', 'mystery', 'ending', 'distinct', 'lack', 'answers', 'finale', 'solid', 'anime', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'amazing', 'art', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'few', 'arcs.Two', 'years', 'ago', 'Ayumu', 'Narumi', 'got', 'phone', 'call', 'older', 'genius', 'brother', 'Kiyotaka', 'announced', 'was', 'investigating', 'Blade', 'Children', 'then', 'vanished.Much', 'later', 'girl', 'named', 'Sayoko', 'balcony', 'Ayumu', 'only', 'possible', 'suspect', 'even', 'police', 'inspector', 'sister-in-law', 'Madoka', 'Ayumu', 'same', 'astounding', 'analytical', 'skills', 'older', 'brother', 'soon', 'pair', 'crimes', 'connected', 'Sayoko', 'fall', 'locked-room', 'murder', 'only', 'find', 'involve', 'Blade', 'Children.Unfortunately', 'Blade', 'Children', 'are', 'getting', 'interested', 'Ayumu', 'first', 'smart', 'bomb', 'planted', 'piano', 'concert', 'then', 'weird', 'boy', 'Ayumu', 'abandoned', 'school', 'playing', 'deadly', 'game', 'young', 'genius', 'teacher', 'murdered', 'Ayumu', 'pulled', 'deadly', 'mind', 'game', 'precocious', 'Blade', 'Child', 'self-esteem', 'then', 'deadly', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game.But', 'even', 'Ayumu', 'Blade', 'Children', 'deadly', 'faction', 'involved', 'Blade', 'Children', 'Hunters', 'who', 'kill', 'anyone', 'are', 'allied', 'Even', 'worse', 'new', 'enemy', 'Blade', 'Children', 'Kanone', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Blade', 'Children', 'must', 'not', 'live', 'Ayumu', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'hope', 'now', 'Kanone', 'enemy', 'Spiral', 'delving', 'mystery', 'Blade', 'Children', 'literally', 'first', 'scene', 'Kiyotaka', 'parting', 'words', 'expecting', 'lots', 'action', 'slapstick', 'flashy', 'superspecial', 'powers', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bored', 'smarter', 'brand', 'anime', 'confrontations', 'usually', 'end', 'nothing', 'more', 'spectacular', 'then', 'scuffle', 'only', 'special', 'powers', 'Ayumu', 'are', 'intellectual', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'reveal', 'much', 'do', 'spin', 'web', 'clever', 'intellectual', 'mysteries', 'magic', 'squares', 'explosive', 'neckwear', 'bombs', 'mystery', 'future', 'killings', 'card', 'tricks', 'abandoned', 'hotel', 'rigged', 'explosives', 'are', 'pretty', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'simplicity.And', 'when', 'Ayumu', ""n't"", 'pondering', 'mysteries', 'episodes', 'are', 'peppered', 'comedy', 'one', 'scene', 'Hiyono', 'distracting', 'Ayumu', 'get', 'arcade', 'toy', 'show', 'characters', 'pasts', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'problem', 'Blade', 'Children', 'episodes', 'are', 'infused', 'sense', 'ominous', 'hopelessness', 'never', 'quite', 'pity', 'yet', 'casual', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'though', 'one', 'thing', 'second', 'half', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'dependent', 'big', 'kabooms', 'simple', 'mind', 'games', 'murders', 'mindwork', 'still', 'there', 'not', 'prominent', 'ending', 'never', 'learn', 'what', 'Blade', 'Children', 'are', 'where', 'came', 'why', 'Hunters', 'hate', 'so.Daniel', 'Kats', 'uuml', 'k', 'excellent', 'job', 'Ayumu', 'laid-back', 'unemotional', 'demeanor', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'hard', 'really', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'natural', 'gifts', 'understandable', 'Ayumu', 'would', 'feel', 'so', 'inferior', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'brother', 'Caitlin', 'Glass', 'Hiyono', 'rather', 'annoying', 'hyperactive', 'Thank', 'God', 'blessing', 'awesome', 'seats', 'Gwendolen', 'Lau', 'excellent', 'gutsy', 'vulnerable', 'Madoka.And', 'voicework', 'Blade', 'Children', 'pretty', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'John', 'Burgmeier', 'Greg', 'Ayres', 'are', 'excellent', 'melancholy', 'Eyes', 'Rutherford', 'devilish', 'Kousuke', 'Laura', 'Bailey', 'excellent', 'gutsy', 'runner', 'Ryoko', 'Monica', 'Rial', 'solid', 'girlish', 'ruthless', 'Rio', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Kanone', 'supposed', 'have', 'brick-thick', 'Southern', 'accent', 'though', 'Spiral', 'mystery', 'never', 'really', 'intricate', 'storyline', 'suspense', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'nice', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'finding', 'end', 'elsewhere']",Spiral: Complete Series

Not to say that Cased Closed isn't good or anything but just making a quick pointer. Anyhow, with this series, you get a nice fusion of mystery, action, and comedy. This one is definitely a ""thinking man's"" anime. It has you constantly pondering about what is going on or what has happened within the story. You will find yourself analyzing what is or has transpired more often than none in a way like when you watch an anime like Ghost in the Shell. But don't let this turn you off from the show. There is enough action to keep you interested and a very generous dose of comedy to keep you laughing and feeling light-hearted. Plus, it doesn't hurt that the characters(and how they develop throughout the show) and storyline are both top-notch and that the series is only 25 episodes and not a bazillion episodes like Case Closed.
