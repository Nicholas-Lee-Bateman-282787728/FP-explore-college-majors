There is a fine line between true reality and fictionalized reality. The writers seem to know exactly how to merge them both and give their audience a believeable storyline to hold you captive. The actors and actresses are the greatest with their craft and experiences. If you haven't seen it, please do--you won't be disappointed. I know nothing about the personal lives of the people in New Orleans and I don't know anyone who lives in New Orleasn and I know nothing about the horror and devastation of flood waters and losing your home to the destruction and stresses that it can cause. But I have sympathy and empathy for all.

1429784,AI1HCK9KJ5QX7,B004UXVFIO,JB,"[0, 0]","The second season of Treme is a notable change in tone from the first. While still not a police procedural by any means, it begins to cover the topic of crime in several ways, deviously woven into the day-in-the-life stories the show has established. The show also expands its landscape, spending a day with the Cajuns and their Mardis Gras well away from the city, following a character's relocation to New York, and introducing new characters. Somehow, Vietnamese shrimpers are introduced into the show.The crime is white-collar as well, and a devious real estate developer and a crooked political element are introduced. I was utterly shocked to learn that one politician character is played by the real person on whom he is based.Other highlights include a character starting his own band, and a new emphasis on music students in public middle schools. The latter are not covered in the same depth as schools in The Wire, but provide a deeper sense of reality and community to the show as a whole.Really, though, I don't have to sell it.

That's because it is...you need to watch this.For the musicFor the very real charactersFor the never-flagging story linesFor the food...which makes those food porn cooking shows look like TV dinners...and most of all for a place that is uniquely our own but not ours.I should say I am not a television fan. I have not seen a single episode of Friends or Glee or Dancing with the Stars or Twilight.  TV is the great wasteland.  Treme is the rare exception.  Treme is beautiful. The characters will break your heart and fix it and break it again. It is the only television show I have ever watched where I laugh and I cry and share the emotions. There is humor and wit as well. The acting is first class, the writing simply the best. It never gets soapy or soppy, it's hip and sarcastic, but depicts very honest emotions. The characters are unique, and they're real...no one note villains or heroes. People are good and bad, sometimes at the same time. The one semi-villain is so charming, it's hard not to like him while not liking him...the way it is with most con artists and grifters and schemers.  The story lines never take the easy way out either.And then there's New Orleans and the music and all the things hat makes it special.  It's impossible not to watch a funeral sequence without wanting to strut.  Listening to Howling Wolf without waving your arms over your head? Impossible.  This is such an involving show, it makes you want to get off that couch and dance! Or grin. Or cry. Or party. Or eat, fight, make love, make music, cook, something. You don't just watch Treme,you experience it.  It's a magical show in a magical setting.New Orleans is not America but it is something you'd find only in America, a place that's real and human, beautiful, dirty and gritty, loud, steeped in tradition and unlike any other place on the planet. There is a move afoot to gentrify the place, turn it into some cleancut Disnleyland with To Go cups and mardi gras beads. If we let that happen, we lose that which cannot ever be replaced. If you don't love New Orleans already, watch this show so you will, and so you won't allow the Powers To Be to destroy what's left of her.I want to say so much about this show, how moving it is, how unforgettable the music is...but you just have to watch it and hear it to understand.Five stars...easy.

In Treme's second season we see and really feel how the natives live and die.'Treme' season two moves to the lives of the musicians, the businesses trying to thrive and into the police stations and politicians pockets. The regulars like Antoine Batiste, played by Wendell Pierce, find themselves trying to rebuild their lives. In his case, he is a trombonist and works in the local school band by day and in the clubs by night. Terry Colson, played by David Morse, is a detective in the police department, where he feels out the greed and graft of his colleagues. Melissa Leo, plays Toni, the local lawyer who fights for her clients and now finds herself trying to help her daughter, Sofia. Sofia, played by India Ennenga, who is reacting to a tragic loss, has become the teenager with rebellion andresentment. Chef Janette, played by Kim Dickens has moved to New York City to try and ply her wares in the big time. Professional trumpeter Delmond, played by Rob Brown also moved to NYC to find his profession.'Treme' season two looks at the day-to-day journey of its people. A lot going on in the second season. In every episode there are surprising finds.  I became involved in the characters lives, and their struggles. Ladonna, played by Khandi Alexander, has a personal tragedy that leads to more grief. There is so much personal grief and trauma that all of the crinme in New Orleans takes its toll.  We look at the spirit of the people of New Orleans and in particular, the people we follow. Anthony Bourdain contributes to the food scene. New romances abound, crime increases, the musicians become more authentic. Jon Seda, who plays Nelson Hildago, gives us a glimpse of the FEMA corruption that we have heard about all throughout the aftermath of Katrina. Such wonderful character development by the superb writing team of David Simon and Eric Overmyer. Treme may become as important and as wonderful as my all time favorite series, 'The Wire'. Treme gives us a wonderful drama, a snapshot of a city, and its people, all changing with the seasons.Highly Recommended.  prisrob 07-16-11Homicide: A Year on the Killing StreetsThe Avon Barksdale Story: Legends of the UnwiredBiography - Overmeyer, Eric (1951(?)-): An article from: Contemporary Authors Online",4,Down Here In New Orleans,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2582,"['got', 'magic', 'good', 'badMake', 'happy', 'make', 'real', 'sadGet', 'everything', 'want', 'lose', 'what', 'hadDown', 'here', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Dr', ""John'Treme"", 'HBO', 'magnificent', 'season', 'one', 'introduced', 'New', 'Orleans', 'post-Katrina', 'music', 'people', 'problems', 'lives', 'everyday', 'people', 'trying', 'make', 'work', 'Treme', 'second', 'season', 'see', 'really', 'feel', 'how', 'natives', 'live', 'die', 'season', 'two', 'moves', 'lives', 'musicians', 'businesses', 'trying', 'thrive', 'police', 'stations', 'politicians', 'pockets', 'regulars', 'Antoine', 'Batiste', 'played', 'Wendell', 'Pierce', 'find', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'lives', 'case', 'trombonist', 'local', 'school', 'band', 'day', 'clubs', 'night', 'Terry', 'Colson', 'played', 'David', 'Morse', 'detective', 'police', 'department', 'where', 'out', 'greed', 'graft', 'colleagues', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Toni', 'local', 'lawyer', 'who', 'clients', 'now', 'trying', 'help', 'daughter', 'Sofia', 'Sofia', 'played', 'India', 'Ennenga', 'who', 'reacting', 'tragic', 'loss', 'become', 'teenager', 'rebellion', 'andresentment', 'Chef', 'Janette', 'played', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'try', 'ply', 'wares', 'big', 'time', 'Professional', 'trumpeter', 'Delmond', 'played', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'also', 'moved', 'NYC', 'find', 'profession', 'season', 'two', 'day-to-day', 'journey', 'people', 'lot', 'going', 'second', 'season', 'episode', 'are', 'surprising', 'finds', 'became', 'involved', 'characters', 'lives', 'struggles', 'Ladonna', 'played', 'Khandi', 'Alexander', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'more', 'grief', 'so', 'much', 'personal', 'grief', 'trauma', 'crinme', 'New', 'Orleans', 'toll', 'look', 'spirit', 'people', 'New', 'Orleans', 'particular', 'people', 'follow', 'Anthony', 'Bourdain', 'food', 'scene', 'New', 'romances', 'abound', 'crime', 'increases', 'musicians', 'become', 'more', 'authentic', 'Jon', 'Seda', 'who', 'Nelson', 'Hildago', 'glimpse', 'FEMA', 'corruption', 'have', 'heard', 'aftermath', 'Katrina', 'Such', 'wonderful', 'character', 'development', 'superb', 'writing', 'team', 'David', 'Simon', 'Eric', 'Overmyer', 'Treme', 'may', 'become', 'important', 'as', 'wonderful', 'time', 'favorite', 'series', 'Wire', 'Treme', 'wonderful', 'drama', 'snapshot', 'city', 'people', 'changing', 'seasons.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '07-16-11Homicide', 'Year', 'Killing', 'StreetsThe', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'Story', 'Legends', 'UnwiredBiography', 'Overmeyer', 'Eric', '1951', 'article', 'Contemporary', 'Authors', 'Online']",Treme: Season 2

But the bottom line is this show is boring. There is very little plot development. There is no story. The actors are predictable and play the part of people in New Orleans, but I haven't met any characters as boring or as eccentric as the ones played in Treme. Treme is at its best an outsider's romantic view of New Orleans. At its worst it is pity television, trying to make a case for how tough New Orleans is and how vital the traditions here are. Through it all, it perpetuates the victim mentality that is pervasive in the city. I tried getting through the entire season, but gave up around the eighth episode because it was so extraordinarily boring and plotless.The only thing that works in the show is the cinematography.

1429803,A2UOH8KAGORCOH,B004UXVFIO,V. Ferguson,"[0, 0]","This is a truly great show. I was hooked with the first season and by the end of the second season I am cursing HBO for only having 3 and 1/2 seasons (season 4 is only 5 episodes). By this season I am fully engaged in the stories of each cast member and how they came to be at the point they are at in any given time. I like that their is no main character that the show puts too much emphasis on - they are all equally important. I like that each episode explores what is going on in each of their lives, moving from first one then another, until they revolve back and pick up again. It makes the show interesting in that you actually have to think to keep up and are not blindly watching. I miss John Goodman's character, but the exploration of the wife and daughter's grief and how they do and don't handle it is well done - very real. The exploration of the NOPD's corruption, the additional corruption of council members and serving politicians and how they all literally took the food out of the mouths of the people they swore to serve has been borne out through trials and testimony and is very well portrayed here. But, what struck me was that by the end of season 4 you acknowledge that corruption is as much a part of the culture as the incredible jazz they love and play with such heart and soul.  I am watching the entire show for the 2nd time and have already picked up a number of things I missed in the first go round.
