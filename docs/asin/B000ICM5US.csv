The image here only shows you 1 out of 4 DVD boxes that arrive in a large boxset container. Each of the four Volumes contains 6 discs and is adorned with a different color thundercat logo for each (yellow,purple,red,blue) . There is unique artwork on each slim case container holding 2 dvds each. This is the entire collection mind you at a price far less than the US releases which are split up into four seperate retail items. These discs are meant for UK dvd players or Unlockable (all region) dvd players. Your Dvd player may be unlockable , also keep in mind your computer can play any region disc with the right software so watching these should not be a problem. They won't play in a standard US dvd player unless it is unlockable.",5,AWESOME! JUST AWESOME.

1020037,A6S7BFWB40M6B,B000ICM5US,KAB,"[3, 4]","A great collection of episodes (it competes only with its older cousin, MOTU, for its historic staying power of two full seasons [130 episodes]). While this was a great series, it was not without its faults (particularly, throughout the last half of the second season). Still, here it is for all of us to enjoy!Audio: The audio seems to translate very well to DVD on most episodes. In some instances, however, the background music is completely LOST throughout the entire episode (""Unholy Alliance"" springs immediately to mind). With the audio of many episodes translating so well, it does nothing for the Warners' credibiity that the attention to details of other episodes is so lax that they are completely missing the background music!Video: There have been some complaints that the video on some of the episodes was not cleaned up since their original airings. Whether or not this is true, it serves two purposes. For one, to have not cleaned up the footage only restores the retro feel of watching these classics on television in our youth. For another, if the video footage was not fully restored, it does give fans ample excuse to complain about aging, dirt, or scratches on the master film (though, this is not nearly as notable as some of the older cartoons from the sixties). In the case of these discs, I personally haven't noticed any problems with aging.Special Features: Mostly interviews from the artists.Episodes: I've touched on this above just a bit but there are a lot of complaints about some of Season 2's episodes being a tad bit lame at times and resorting to old storylines/footage. However, this of course is not the fault of the DVDs if the episodes themselves were poorly written. A fair advanced warning: I hate to belaver the obvious but we watched this when we were younger and not every show translates well as viewers grow older. For me: it's still a great show and the one problem that I took with the discs is that I really thought that the five-part ""Lion-O's Annointment Trial"" should have been packaged together back-to-back (of course, not everyone would agree with me, as this would have placed the episodes at the disadvantage of being out of the order in which they originally aired. You be the judge).Packaging: I was a bit suprised by the packaging. I like the concept art on each DVD case (the outer layer and each individual case) and I particularly like the outside of Season 2 with its ""metamorphic"" image outside of the case. However, I have been spoiled by BTC/BCI's treatment of the Filmation library, and almost expected each volume to have a comprehensive episode guide to tell us what was on each disc of each volume (something that backs of the cases already did) and with a brief summary of each episode.Overall: a fair attempt by Warner Home Video to release this gem from Lorimar/Rankin-Bass for old fans and a new generation to enjoy.

1020038,A2WHZM2P2R88FQ,B000ICM5US,Takahashii,"[85, 86]","The only thing I think is lacking on Amazon's reviews is that they're not making it clear enough that with this set you're getting yourself all the ThunderCats material out there. Season 1 (the original season from where the Cats landed on 3rd Earth (the famous 'Exodus' episode) right to the last on 3rd Earth in which their greatest enemy Mumm-Ra not only has to face the Cats but is threatened by the ancient Spirits of Evil themselves!And next you have the 2nd season which played on New Thundera. The Cats have returned to their original, yet new, home with new friends (The 'new' ThunderCats) and new Cat treasure like the Book of Omens and such. And this is also where the series eventually came to a stop. I can't comment on the exact details since I haven't seen all of those episodes yet myself. But that will soon change now that I ordered this set :-)Some people complained about this release not being remastered, re-dubbed, etc. and quite frankly I consider this to be a big pro instead of a con. In my opinion nothing can beat the original. When companies start re-doing stuff you'll always be left with something missing or ""not entirely right"". Simply because you may have remembered (or lived) it completely different. So my advice would honostly be: ""Now is your chance to grab the entire original series at a very decent price, go for it while you can!"".ThunderCats HOOOOOO!",5,"The original, *all* of it!",1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,1394,"['only', 'thing', 'think', 'lacking', 'Amazon', 'reviews', ""'re"", 'not', 'making', 'clear', 'enough', 'set', ""'re"", 'getting', 'ThunderCats', 'material', 'there', 'Season', '1', 'original', 'season', 'where', 'Cats', 'landed', '3rd', 'Earth', 'famous', 'episode', 'right', 'last', '3rd', 'Earth', 'greatest', 'enemy', 'Mumm-Ra', 'not', 'only', 'face', 'Cats', 'threatened', 'ancient', 'Spirits', 'Evil', 'next', 'have', '2nd', 'season', 'played', 'New', 'Thundera', 'Cats', 'have', 'returned', 'original', 'yet', 'new', 'home', 'new', 'friends', ""'new"", 'ThunderCats', 'new', 'Cat', 'treasure', 'Book', 'Omens', 'such', 'also', 'where', 'series', 'eventually', 'came', 'stop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'exact', 'details', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'yet', 'will', 'soon', 'change', 'now', 'ordered', 'set', 'people', 'complained', 'release', 'not', 'being', 'remastered', 're-dubbed', 'etc', 'quite', 'frankly', 'consider', 'be', 'big', 'pro', 'instead', 'con', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'can', 'beat', 'original', 'When', 'companies', 'start', 're-doing', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'left', 'something', 'missing', 'not', 'entirely', 'right', 'Simply', 'may', 'have', 'remembered', 'lived', 'completely', 'different', 'advice', 'would', 'honostly', 'be', 'Now', 'chance', 'grab', 'entire', 'original', 'series', 'very', 'decent', 'price', 'go', 'can', '.ThunderCats', 'HOOOOOO']",Thundercats: The Complete Seasons 1 and 2
