Roger Tabor might be an expert on cats but he sure bored the world out of us.  We expected to see cats during his narration but we only saw Mr. Tabor walking, sitting, talking in front the camera... finally we saw a few seconds of a cute cat, then we found ourselves looking at Mr. Tabor again!  His monotone literally put our son to sleep.  After our son went to bed I thought I could watch a bit more but I too lost interest within 10 minutes.  To add insult to injury, the picture quality of the movies is subpar.This is not a bad DVD set. But you will have to be a die-hard cat lover to endure all four episodes.",2,The World of Cats - Informative but very boring presentations!,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,693,"['son', 'cats', 'so', 'bought', 'set', 'DVDs', 'watched', 'together', 'Roger', 'Tabor', 'might', 'be', 'expert', 'cats', 'sure', 'bored', 'world', 'expected', 'see', 'cats', 'narration', 'only', 'saw', 'Mr.', 'Tabor', 'walking', 'sitting', 'talking', 'front', 'camera', 'finally', 'saw', 'few', 'seconds', 'cute', 'cat', 'then', 'found', 'looking', 'Mr.', 'Tabor', 'again', 'monotone', 'literally', 'put', 'son', 'sleep', 'son', 'went', 'bed', 'thought', 'could', 'watch', 'bit', 'more', 'too', 'lost', 'interest', '10', 'minutes', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'picture', 'quality', 'movies', 'subpar.This', 'not', 'bad', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'die-hard', 'cat', 'lover', 'endure', 'four', 'episodes']",The World of Cats: Understanding Your Cat

938709,A25PM9JGHPU8EI,B000BB18TU,Wes,"[8, 40]","If you want to understand your cat, forget it. They'll only be understood if they want to be. I like dogs, but cats have it over them in the smarts department. I mean, let's take a look at how each responds to a suburban city street. A dog will wander out into the middle of the road without a thought in the world, careless to the danger of oncoming vehicles around him. The dog unfortunately will likely be struck and killed by someone not paying attention. The cat on the other hand, darts across the street, observant to its surroundings, conscious of its mortality. I also happen to agree with De Niro's character in Meet The Parents, when he talks about how cats make you earn their respect. That's mostly true. A dog is more fun to play with, taking it for walks, throwing the frisbee. But the cat's selectivity and aloofness make the attention it does give out more interesting and valued.",4,Cats are best,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,897,"['want', 'understand', 'cat', 'forget', ""'ll"", 'only', 'be', 'understood', 'want', 'be', 'dogs', 'cats', 'have', 'over', 'smarts', 'department', 'mean', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'how', 'suburban', 'city', 'street', 'dog', 'will', 'wander', 'out', 'middle', 'road', 'thought', 'world', 'careless', 'danger', 'oncoming', 'vehicles', 'dog', 'unfortunately', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'struck', 'killed', 'someone', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'cat', 'other', 'hand', 'darts', 'street', 'observant', 'surroundings', 'conscious', 'mortality', 'also', 'happen', 'agree', 'De', 'Niro', 'character', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'when', 'how', 'cats', 'make', 'earn', 'respect', 'mostly', 'true', 'dog', 'more', 'fun', 'play', 'taking', 'walks', 'throwing', 'frisbee', 'cat', 'selectivity', 'aloofness', 'make', 'attention', 'give', 'out', 'more', 'interesting', 'valued']",The World of Cats: Understanding Your Cat

They concluded that cats originated in Egypt. World of Cats accepts that conclusion, but Science of Cats gives detailed information on the search using DNA analysis.
