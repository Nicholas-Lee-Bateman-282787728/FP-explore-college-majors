700887,APYNZ6FY4I3KZ,B00006674W,"Lela Soulier ""galadriel""","[9, 11]","This is a 2 hour 10 minute documentary that seems to be a cross between any ET television segment and a typical timeshare travelog video. The home videos, including extented interview segments not usually seen in the usual Elvis rehash documentaries, are worthwhile just to hear Elvis' thoughts in his own words. I had hoped this documentary would be enlightening to show a more balanced (and honest) view of Elvis' duality, since Elvis is usually portrayed as somewhere between an ""angel with a broken wing"" to a lost sinner, but this documentary tends to portray Elvis as a downright neutered cream-puff hearts-and-flowers cherub without a shred of the raw masculine romantic seducer who captured the hearts of millions during his lifetime and after. I had hoped that Diamond Joe would set the record straight, considering he really was Elvis' right-hand man for 20 years, but this movie makes it clear his strings were connected to Elvis Presley Enterprises. The Machine is still running, and Elvis is still lost behind the smoke-screen of media illusion. Elvis never stopped being a man, but his friends seem to have turned him into a shrine, just a picture on the wall, angelic voices in the background, a halo of remembrance -- and the essence of Elvis as dead as vinyl. If you're looking for any true character insight about Elvis, stay away from this documentary. Hero worship and exploitation are a bad combination, and this movie shows the real heartbreak of knowing a man such as Elvis for 20 years, yet apparently having no clue who that man really was. If you want to know the true Elvis, listen to his music, watch the movies and concerts you like, and remember that Elvis never lied about himself. Elvis laid down, but at least he didn't sell out. Loyalty was one of the few qualities Elvis really expected from people close to him. The test of that loyalty might be measured by who kept their silence. After seeing this documentary, I'm thankful to all the people close to Elvis who have kept their mouths shut. Let the music speak for itself -- that was how Elvis spoke to the world. There's no Elvis music in this video, which is probably just as well. The music would have been sanitized, too.",2,Shockingly sanitized -- no wonder Elvis shot the television!,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2212,"['2', 'hour', '10', 'minute', 'documentary', 'be', 'cross', 'ET', 'television', 'segment', 'typical', 'timeshare', 'travelog', 'video', 'home', 'videos', 'including', 'extented', 'interview', 'segments', 'not', 'usually', 'seen', 'usual', 'Elvis', 'rehash', 'documentaries', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'just', 'hear', 'Elvis', 'thoughts', 'own', 'words', 'had', 'hoped', 'documentary', 'would', 'be', 'enlightening', 'show', 'more', 'balanced', 'honest', 'view', 'Elvis', 'duality', 'Elvis', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'somewhere', 'angel', 'broken', 'wing', 'lost', 'sinner', 'documentary', 'portray', 'Elvis', 'downright', 'neutered', 'cream-puff', 'hearts-and-flowers', 'cherub', 'shred', 'raw', 'masculine', 'romantic', 'seducer', 'who', 'captured', 'hearts', 'millions', 'lifetime', 'had', 'hoped', 'Diamond', 'Joe', 'would', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'considering', 'really', 'was', 'Elvis', 'right-hand', 'man', '20', 'years', 'movie', 'clear', 'strings', 'were', 'connected', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Enterprises', 'Machine', 'still', 'running', 'Elvis', 'still', 'lost', 'smoke-screen', 'media', 'illusion', 'Elvis', 'never', 'stopped', 'being', 'man', 'friends', 'seem', 'have', 'turned', 'shrine', 'just', 'picture', 'wall', 'angelic', 'voices', 'background', 'halo', 'remembrance', 'essence', 'Elvis', 'as', 'dead', 'vinyl', ""'re"", 'looking', 'true', 'character', 'insight', 'Elvis', 'stay', 'away', 'documentary', 'Hero', 'worship', 'exploitation', 'are', 'bad', 'combination', 'movie', 'real', 'heartbreak', 'knowing', 'man', 'such', 'Elvis', '20', 'years', 'yet', 'apparently', 'having', 'clue', 'who', 'man', 'really', 'was', 'want', 'know', 'true', 'Elvis', 'music', 'watch', 'movies', 'concerts', 'like', 'remember', 'Elvis', 'never', 'lied', 'Elvis', 'laid', 'down', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'out', 'Loyalty', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'qualities', 'Elvis', 'really', 'expected', 'people', 'close', 'test', 'loyalty', 'might', 'be', 'measured', 'who', 'kept', 'silence', 'seeing', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'people', 'close', 'Elvis', 'who', 'have', 'kept', 'mouths', 'shut', 'Let', 'music', 'speak', 'was', 'how', 'Elvis', 'spoke', 'world', 'Elvis', 'music', 'video', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sanitized', 'too']",N/A
700888,A107H3XGCV6Y4Q,B00006674W,"Paige Turner ""Film Fanatic""","[12, 13]","This is a very positive, upbeat tribute to Elvis by his top man and best friend, Joe Esposito.  He avoids the negative topics that has already been covered endlessly by the media, and focuses on more folksy  and humorous stories about the King. At times I wish he could have talked more in depth about some of the topics, instead of including chapters about the impersonators, the biggest fan, the nuttiest fan. I could have done without that information. I'm sure Joe has a lot more interesting Elvis anecdotes to share, and to see such rubbish included brings this DVD down a couple of stars in my book.Still, it is refreshing to view a kinder portrait of Elvis by someone close to him instead of the vitriol dished out by West, & Co in their book written by Steve Dunleavy.  Elvis deserves better, and so do his fans, so if you're looking for the more sensationlistic Elvis information, you won't find it in this DVD.It is interesting to note that a few years back, Joe Esposito was embroiled in a battle with EP Enterprises (read: Priscilla), who tried to force him to surrender his private collection of movies and photos of Elvis he'd taken over the years. Perhaps this DVD is the result of a compromise that was reached.",3,A Loving Tribute By A Best Friend,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,1227,"['very', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'tribute', 'Elvis', 'top', 'man', 'best', 'friend', 'Joe', 'Esposito', 'negative', 'topics', 'already', 'been', 'covered', 'endlessly', 'media', 'more', 'folksy', 'humorous', 'stories', 'King', 'times', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'talked', 'more', 'depth', 'topics', 'instead', 'including', 'chapters', 'impersonators', 'biggest', 'fan', 'nuttiest', 'fan', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'information', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Joe', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'Elvis', 'share', 'see', 'such', 'rubbish', 'included', 'DVD', 'down', 'couple', 'stars', 'book.Still', 'refreshing', 'view', 'kinder', 'portrait', 'Elvis', 'someone', 'close', 'instead', 'vitriol', 'dished', 'out', 'West', 'Co', 'book', 'written', 'Steve', 'Dunleavy', 'Elvis', 'better', 'so', 'do', 'fans', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'sensationlistic', 'Elvis', 'information', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'DVD.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Joe', 'Esposito', 'was', 'embroiled', 'battle', 'EP', 'Enterprises', 'read', 'Priscilla', 'who', 'tried', 'force', 'surrender', 'private', 'collection', 'movies', 'photos', 'Elvis', ""'d"", 'taken', 'over', 'years', 'Perhaps', 'DVD', 'result', 'compromise', 'was', 'reached']",N/A
700889,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B00006674W,Phil S.,"[0, 0]","A DVD about Elvis and his best friend. His ""second"" Best man and his Best Friend (along with Red West, Charly Hodge, and George Klein).That's okay.This documentary is a bonanza for even casual Elvis fans, filled with rare photos and footage, crystal clear. Especialy if you are interested in the period of Elvis' marriage, 1967 to 1973, you'll love many still pictures, actually much better than we have seen 17 million times.Those fans who are also musicians or Presley record collectors, on the other hands, will have little use for this DVD. Esposito does not srike me as a guy who can recognize an E-chord from an e-mail; nothing about the recording sessions. Nothing at all controversial, nothing critical of his work, and even the most serious Elvis fan want to know why he could not insist on better scripts.Joe was in several of Elvis' flicks and the fan who enjoys EP movie nostalgia/memorabilia *will* dig this item, as it seems JE has alot more memories about Hollywood alot of this item...alot more than Nashville!Talkin' 'bout Elvis pictures, Joe mentions that Elvis liked making ""Harum Scarum"" - considered by many to be his worst movie, by far. Elvis dressed as the Shiek sounds fun to a point...but a first-class Director and Writer is needed to turn a weak musical for teens into something memorable. Priscilla Presley wrote - as I recall - that Elvis loved making the picture in the beginning - he'd come back to the house still in makeup because he looked pretty great in all that ""desert"" attire - but soon he realized it was another depressing buck-grabber.Esposito seems to really enjoy playing Host-Narrator; his sincerity is obvious. If you bought Joe's GOOD ROCKING TONIGHT book on the Big El, you should have this product.[DVD version has eleven extra chapters, with more rare ""memorabilia""].",3,"Rare photos, nice flow",1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,1818,"['DVD', 'Elvis', 'best', 'friend', 'second', 'Best', 'man', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Red', 'West', 'Charly', 'Hodge', 'George', 'Klein', '.That', 'okay.This', 'documentary', 'bonanza', 'even', 'casual', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'filled', 'rare', 'photos', 'footage', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Especialy', 'are', 'interested', 'period', 'Elvis', 'marriage', '1967', '1973', ""'ll"", 'love', 'many', 'still', 'pictures', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'seen', '17', 'million', 'times.Those', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'musicians', 'Presley', 'record', 'collectors', 'other', 'hands', 'will', 'have', 'little', 'use', 'DVD', 'Esposito', 'not', 'srike', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'recognize', 'E-chord', 'e-mail', 'nothing', 'recording', 'sessions', 'Nothing', 'controversial', 'nothing', 'critical', 'work', 'even', 'most', 'serious', 'Elvis', 'fan', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'insist', 'better', 'scripts.Joe', 'was', 'several', 'Elvis', 'flicks', 'fan', 'who', 'EP', 'movie', 'nostalgia/memorabilia', '*will*', 'dig', 'item', 'JE', 'alot', 'more', 'memories', 'Hollywood', 'alot', 'item', 'alot', 'more', 'Nashville', 'Talkin', 'Elvis', 'pictures', 'Joe', 'mentions', 'Elvis', 'liked', 'making', 'Harum', 'Scarum', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'worst', 'movie', 'far', 'Elvis', 'dressed', 'Shiek', 'fun', 'point', 'first-class', 'Director', 'Writer', 'needed', 'turn', 'weak', 'musical', 'teens', 'something', 'memorable', 'Priscilla', 'Presley', 'wrote', 'recall', 'Elvis', 'loved', 'making', 'picture', 'beginning', ""'d"", 'come', 'back', 'house', 'still', 'makeup', 'looked', 'pretty', 'great', 'desert', 'attire', 'soon', 'realized', 'was', 'depressing', 'buck-grabber.Esposito', 'really', 'enjoy', 'playing', 'Host-Narrator', 'sincerity', 'obvious', 'bought', 'Joe', 'GOOD', 'ROCKING', 'TONIGHT', 'book', 'Big', 'El', 'should', 'have', 'product', '[', 'DVD', 'version', 'eleven', 'extra', 'chapters', 'more', 'rare', 'memorabilia', ']']",N/A

Still photos, newsreel footage, etc., never seen by the public make this offer worthwhile.It seems Elvis had [three] best friends, [songwriter / actor / bodyguard] Red West, Gospel-C & W star/musical mentor Charlie Hodge, and Mr. Esposito. That's okay, I'm just surprised that these other names are mostly vacant from the proceedings. [Historians-fans check out Charlie's good video ""The Elvis I Knew"", Decker Television, 1994].Joe does not dwell on Elvis 1960s' commercial slump nor his 1970s' personal struggles. Just once I'd love to hear how a creative force like Presley managed to deal with bad picture after bad picture. Esposito simply says they were escapist endeavours, and that's that - one must assume that the ""Star Is Born"" rejection by The Colonel was an issue with Elvis and his closest companions. The stars' prescription drug problem has been recounted enough by now, though, so the program does not suffer by lack of address to it.The tape runs 130 minutes with about 20 unnecessary minutes. The narrative runs chronologically about to the point it should close, but suddenly we're going back in time again, and then we are treated to some dedicated (to say the least) cameos with Elvis imitators and other ardent supporters. So J.E. gives them their ""15"" minutes of fame. Why not?Ofcourse there are areas of Presley's life which many find still mysterious - his actual law enforcement credentials and the reportedly planned Grand Jury proceedings to take place on/prior to 08-15-1977 relevant to the idea that Vernon and Elvis Presley were victims of [trick].
