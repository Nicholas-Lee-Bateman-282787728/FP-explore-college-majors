Jane March gives a good performance in this and seems to have a knack for playing that type of character.  A bit wordy and to various points but it's all fairly well done.",3,A good twist to the usual story,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,243,"['wait', 'other', 'shoe', 'drop', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'Jane', 'March', 'good', 'performance', 'have', 'knack', 'playing', 'type', 'character', 'bit', 'wordy', 'various', 'points', 'fairly', 'well', 'done']",Stalker
1661943,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00DVD5TMW,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[0, 0]","The inspired by.... appears at the beginning of the film. For a good portion of it, I was like, &#34;OK...inspired by or remake by another name?&#34; I'm not fond of remakes... But then the twist came and the movie went in a totally different direction. Still, there's a lot that will be familiar to you.  Paula Martin instead of Paul Martin, the housekeeper, even Linda's got the same name. The unrelated field kill early on. Anyway, this film is polished, well crafted, and well done. Not that House on Straw Hill isn't. That's a classic for a reason. My comparisons to the original ended before that sentence. Well, I'll throw in that Udo Kier was more fun for me too watch... but that's another story. Paula Martin was a bit pathetic, though the actress did a good job. Linda, however, compensated for that in spades. Any self-respecting horror fan will see this film. There's nothing to complain about (though undoubtedly people will find something). It does NOT bump off &#34;House's&#34; classic status. But it doesn't try to. I'm just protective of my classics.",4,A Horror Junkie's review: inspired by House on Straw Hill,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,1069,"['inspired', 'beginning', 'film', 'good', 'portion', 'was', '34', 'inspired', 'remake', 'name', '34', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'remakes', 'then', 'twist', 'came', 'movie', 'went', 'totally', 'different', 'direction', 'Still', 'lot', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'Paula', 'Martin', 'instead', 'Paul', 'Martin', 'housekeeper', 'even', 'Linda', 'got', 'same', 'name', 'unrelated', 'field', 'kill', 'early', 'Anyway', 'film', 'polished', 'well', 'crafted', 'well', 'done', 'Not', 'House', 'Straw', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'classic', 'reason', 'comparisons', 'original', 'ended', 'sentence', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'throw', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'too', 'watch', 'story', 'Paula', 'Martin', 'was', 'bit', 'pathetic', 'actress', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Linda', 'however', 'compensated', 'spades', 'self-respecting', 'horror', 'fan', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'nothing', 'complain', 'undoubtedly', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'NOT', 'bump', 'off', '34', 'House', '34', 'classic', 'status', ""n't"", 'try', ""'m"", 'just', 'protective', 'classics']",Stalker
1661944,A387BD735MI50R,B00DVD5TMW,R. Schultz,"[2, 3]","You might be able to anticipate whatever twists or turns there are in this plot. And most of the elements of the protagonist's isolation are all too familiar - her retreat to an old English manor house to write her next novel, the somewhat sinister housekeeper there, the rush of pond water through the weir and the old tunnel, the deserted stables.  However, this is still a worthwhile thriller.The English accents give this film more of a classically eerie atmosphere. But the real reason this film is a cut above others in the genre is its willingness to dwell on interior close-ups. It especially features lingering close-ups of the faces of the characters in this story, inviting you to guess at whatever menace or madness is revealing itself in their features.",4,Above Average Psychological Thriller,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,766,"['might', 'be', 'able', 'anticipate', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'plot', 'most', 'elements', 'protagonist', 'isolation', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'retreat', 'old', 'English', 'manor', 'house', 'write', 'next', 'novel', 'somewhat', 'sinister', 'housekeeper', 'there', 'rush', 'pond', 'water', 'weir', 'old', 'tunnel', 'deserted', 'stables', 'However', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'thriller.The', 'English', 'accents', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'classically', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'real', 'reason', 'film', 'cut', 'others', 'genre', 'willingness', 'dwell', 'interior', 'close-ups', 'especially', 'lingering', 'close-ups', 'characters', 'story', 'inviting', 'guess', 'menace', 'madness', 'revealing', 'features']",Stalker

1661946,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00DVD5TMW,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","Paula (Anna Brecon) has written a best seller and her publisher Sara (Jennifer Matter) loves her. Paula is reclusive and has some mental issues. Sara strongly recommends Paula stay at her uncle's unoccupied manor and start writing her second best seller. While there Paula meets Linda (Jane March), a woman sent by Sara to assist her. Paula resists leaving the place even when it is clear she needs stitches and a tetanus shot.This film is currently making its way around Redbox. I can't compare this to any film because of the twist, which unfortunately I had figured out way too early in the film for it to be enjoyable. For those who didn't see it coming, 4 stars. 2 stars for those who do. While there is blood and killing, it is more of a drama/thriller than a horror.
