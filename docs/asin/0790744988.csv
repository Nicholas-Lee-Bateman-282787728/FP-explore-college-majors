Will they try to get Frank Ross the reporter and make it look like an accident? Ross is found guilty of drunk driving and killing people. There is a dramatic scene in court. Talking is forbidden in prison, prisoners must keep their arms folded. There is conflict among some prisoners. The guard Pete Lang is tough on the prisoners. Does solitary confinement create insanity. [Yes.] Will Stacy get his revenge? They watch a movie but it is interrupted when a prisoner falls over. There is a plan by Stacy to escape. Ross gets a visitor who tells him about the effort to clear him. ""Once its done keep your mouth shut.""Stacy is turned in by Ross. The ""Hudson County News"" tells of the trial. Ross gets blamed for the escape and is put in the hole. Will he turn mean? Will Stacy do something for Ross? If he can find the finger man the crime would be solved. Will Ross earn a chance for parole? There is an incident on the shop floor. Ross shows emotion at the parole hearing. On th outside, Stacy gets an admission from the finger-man as to who was behind the frame-up of Ross. Stacy has a new plan, but something happens. Will the desperate prisoners crash out? What will the National Guard do? Will somebody confess under duress? ""So long Stacy.""The warden told what happened. Ross is released. [But you knew that justice would triumph in the end for a happy ending.] This isn't a bad story, but it isn't all that good compared to other films of that era. A film that educated people about corruption in government might have been better.

115726,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790744988,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The combination of 1939 and James Cagney already worked smashingly (yes, I just used that word) with `The Roaring Twenties', so I was anxious to get to watching `Each Dawn I Die'.  I love James Cagney.  His presence was so strong and his swagger was so natural and easy going.  I was happy to see he wasn't playing the `thug' in this one, and was curious to see how he took on the newspaperman under false arrest.Sadly, this just didn't work at all.I think the biggest detracter is the style in which it is all presented.  Sure, it is a sign of the times and certainly in flow with the 30's cinematic fare and yet some things can be presented in a timeless fashion and those pieces just didn't line up properly for `Each Dawn I Die'.  The acting is the film's sorest spot, and because of the inability for the large supporting cast to carry the weight of their respective roles, the film faltered more often than not.  Even Cagney struggled to play his newspaperman as anything other than a thug.  He couldn't walk that line of `good guy on the brink' that he needed to in order to make it all work.  It's surprising to me, because his take on the army-man turned thug in `The Roaring Twenties' was fantastic.  Here, he can't seem to get it right.  Still, he's the least of the problems.  The actor who played the nasty guard was TERRIBLE to the point where he made me squirm, and the action sequences were sloppy and felt terribly stagey.  The script was also a downfall.  It felt too clich&eacute;d and melodramatic, especially as the film drew to a close and focus came upon the budding bromance between Cagney's newspaperman and Raft's thug.  It was terribly unbelievable and sappy for a film about prison crime.Eh, Raft was the film's only shining moment, but even he couldn't rescue this mediocre offering.",2,A Cagney tumble...,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1812,"['combination', '1939', 'James', 'Cagney', 'already', 'worked', 'smashingly', 'yes', 'just', 'used', 'word', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'was', 'anxious', 'get', 'watching', 'Dawn', 'Die', 'love', 'James', 'Cagney', 'presence', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'swagger', 'was', 'so', 'natural', 'easy', 'going', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'playing', 'thug', 'one', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'took', 'newspaperman', 'false', 'arrest.Sadly', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'all.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'detracter', 'style', 'presented', 'Sure', 'sign', 'times', 'certainly', 'flow', '30', 'cinematic', 'fare', 'yet', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'presented', 'timeless', 'fashion', 'pieces', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'line', 'up', 'properly', 'Dawn', 'Die', 'acting', 'film', 'sorest', 'spot', 'inability', 'large', 'supporting', 'cast', 'carry', 'weight', 'respective', 'roles', 'film', 'faltered', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Even', 'Cagney', 'struggled', 'play', 'newspaperman', 'anything', 'other', 'thug', 'could', ""n't"", 'walk', 'line', 'good', 'guy', 'brink', 'needed', 'order', 'make', 'work', 'surprising', 'take', 'army-man', 'turned', 'thug', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'right', 'Still', 'least', 'problems', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'nasty', 'guard', 'was', 'TERRIBLE', 'point', 'where', 'made', 'squirm', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'sloppy', 'felt', 'terribly', 'stagey', 'script', 'was', 'also', 'downfall', 'felt', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'melodramatic', 'especially', 'film', 'drew', 'close', 'focus', 'came', 'budding', 'bromance', 'Cagney', 'newspaperman', 'Raft', 'thug', 'was', 'terribly', 'unbelievable', 'sappy', 'film', 'prison', 'crime.Eh', 'Raft', 'was', 'film', 'only', 'shining', 'moment', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'mediocre', 'offering']",N/A

115729,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0790744988,Craig Connell,"[1, 2]","James Cagney and George Raft elevate this prison movie from just fair-to-poor to slightly-better-than average.....with just their screen presence. Without them, I wouldn't have even given this a second look. That second look was on DVD, too, and it looks a lot better than the VHS editionCagney plays a newspaper man (""Frank Ross"") framed for killing people as a drunk driver. The truth was that he was knocked out cold, put behind a wheel, doused with alcohol and then had the car started. Just by coincidence, the car rams into others and kills people and, of course, witnesses - true and false ones - are there to testify against him. In jail, he meets mobster ""Stacey"" (George Raft) who slowly takes a liking to Ross..If you stop to analyze a few things, you'll lose all regard for the story. There are many holes in this story and you just have to go along with them. The movie did serve a good purpose. Reportedly, because of this film there was some needed prison reform. Convicts were treated in way too harsh a manner back then. As in most cases, we now have gone too far in the opposite direction, it's been said, but that's another story.Other than that historical significance of this film having some real-life impact, it's not a memorable movie.

115730,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,0790744988,Douglas M,"[4, 4]","""Each Dawn I Die"", released in 1939, is the best of the prison films which Warner Brothers made in the thirties. Even the title is fantastic. James Cagney plays a reporter working for a newspaper who is exposing the politicians who run the rackets. Cagney is framed, convicted and sent to prison for 10 years as retaliation. There, he meets hardened criminal George Raft.The film was produced by Hal Wallis and benefits from a bigger budget than most of its predecessors. There is a more detailed and convincing expose of prison life than usual and cliches are avoided. You get a real feel for the hopelessness and boredom of the inmates. Cagney is subdued and underplays - very effective. George Raft, usually a wooden and stiff actor, rises to Cagney's level. Their friendship becomes very touching. The film develops real suspense as you wonder if Cagney will ever be released. Jane Bryan plays Cagney's girlfriend with a small but key part in the plot. Bryan was a very talented actress on the Warner's payroll who retired early when she married. She invests the part with great depth and is touching.The print is excellent and the DVD has lots of extras, including a really worthwhile commentary by Haden Guest; at last, a commentator with a pleasant voice who avoids trivial biographical details and really observes the film as it unfolds. A contemporary featurette documentary on the language of the gangster film is included but it is by far the weakest in this series - a lot of historians/actors etc saying which lines they liked and who they imitated as children - yawn! There is also another of the Warner's blooper shorts which are entertaining, particularly if you know the actors on the studio payroll then. ""A Day at San Anita"" is is technicolour short film set around the race track. It stars the nauseating Shirley Temple contemporary Sybil Jason who is cloying in the worst child star sense. The colour is excellent and there is some interest in the shots of stars such as Bette Davis and then husband Harmon Nelson and Ruby Keeler with Al Jolson. The cartoon, which definitely does not date to 1939, is OK with a rooster that may have developed into Foghorn Leghorn. Finally, the Lux Radio version of the film is included with Franchot Tone replacing Cagney. These radio versions really only have historical interest.The DVD is excellent value, particularly if purchased as part of the Warner's Tough Guys Collection.",5,Best of the Prison Films,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,2437,"['Dawn', 'Die', 'released', '1939', 'best', 'prison', 'films', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'made', 'thirties', 'Even', 'title', 'fantastic', 'James', 'Cagney', 'reporter', 'working', 'newspaper', 'who', 'exposing', 'politicians', 'who', 'run', 'rackets', 'Cagney', 'framed', 'convicted', 'sent', 'prison', '10', 'years', 'retaliation', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'George', 'Raft.The', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Hal', 'Wallis', 'benefits', 'bigger', 'budget', 'most', 'predecessors', 'more', 'detailed', 'convincing', 'expose', 'prison', 'life', 'usual', 'cliches', 'are', 'avoided', 'get', 'real', 'feel', 'hopelessness', 'boredom', 'inmates', 'Cagney', 'subdued', 'underplays', 'very', 'effective', 'George', 'Raft', 'usually', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'actor', 'Cagney', 'level', 'friendship', 'becomes', 'very', 'touching', 'film', 'real', 'suspense', 'wonder', 'Cagney', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'Jane', 'Bryan', 'Cagney', 'girlfriend', 'small', 'key', 'part', 'plot', 'Bryan', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'Warner', 'payroll', 'who', 'retired', 'early', 'when', 'married', 'part', 'great', 'depth', 'touching.The', 'print', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'lots', 'extras', 'including', 'really', 'worthwhile', 'commentary', 'Haden', 'Guest', 'last', 'commentator', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'who', 'trivial', 'biographical', 'details', 'really', 'film', 'contemporary', 'featurette', 'documentary', 'language', 'gangster', 'film', 'included', 'far', 'weakest', 'series', 'lot', 'historians/actors', 'etc', 'saying', 'lines', 'liked', 'who', 'imitated', 'children', 'yawn', 'also', 'Warner', 'blooper', 'shorts', 'are', 'entertaining', 'particularly', 'know', 'actors', 'studio', 'payroll', 'then', 'Day', 'San', 'Anita', 'technicolour', 'short', 'film', 'set', 'race', 'track', 'nauseating', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'contemporary', 'Sybil', 'Jason', 'who', 'cloying', 'worst', 'child', 'star', 'sense', 'colour', 'excellent', 'interest', 'shots', 'stars', 'such', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'then', 'husband', 'Harmon', 'Nelson', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'cartoon', 'definitely', 'not', 'date', '1939', 'OK', 'rooster', 'may', 'have', 'developed', 'Foghorn', 'Leghorn', 'Finally', 'Lux', 'Radio', 'version', 'film', 'included', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'replacing', 'Cagney', 'radio', 'versions', 'really', 'only', 'have', 'historical', 'interest.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'value', 'particularly', 'purchased', 'part', 'Warner', 'Tough', 'Guys', 'Collection']",N/A
115731,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0790744988,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","""Each Dawn I Die"" is a 1939 gangster/prison film, and the only time mega stars James Cagney and George Raft shared film credit. Prison films are a staple of Hollywood and even TV nowadays. They go back to the earliest years of the talkie period. ""The Big House"" (1930) was the first film to gain wide critical and popular acclaim. Films like Hell's House"" (1932), Hell's Highway"" (1932), ""20,000 Years in Sing Sing"" (1932) and ""The Mayor from Hell"" (1933) followed, as well as the chain gang films, the most famous of which was ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932) and later ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967).Jimmy Cagney (1899-1986) was one of the biggest stars of the 30s and 40s, was nominated for an Oscar for his work in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938) and won for his 1942 portrayal of George M Cohan in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"". While he's best known for his gangster roles, the majority of Cagney's screen appearances were not as a gangster - he played  an insurance salesman (""The Millionaire"", 1931), an engineer (""Other Men's Women"", 1931),  a boxer (""Winner Take All"", 1932), an auto racer (""The Crowd Roars"", 1932), a Broadway producer (""Footlight Parade"", 1933), etc. Indeed, Cagney often appeared in comedies (e.g., ""Here Comes the Navy"", ""Hard to Handle"", ""Jimmy the Gent""), although it was his gangster films that earned the really big bucks. In this film we get the best of both worlds - Cagney plays a reporter who gets sent to prison.George Raft (1901-80) is best known for his gangster roles in films like ""Scarface"" (1932), ""Each Dawn I Die"" (1939) and ""Some Like it Hot"" (1959), but he was far more versatile and in many of his films he played a dancer or a musician (""Winner Take All"",  ""Bolero"", ""Limehouse Blues"") or his role was primarily comedic (""Night after Night"", ""Every Night at Eight"").Slapsie Maxie"" Rosenblum (1907-76) was a boxer turned actor. He was the Light Heavyweight Champion of the World from 1932 to 1934, then turned to film (""Gangs of New York"", ""Each Dawn I Die"", ""20,000 Men a Year"") and later TV (""The Joe Palooka Story""). His most memorable performance may have been the 1956 live teleplay ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" starring Jack Palance and Keenan Wynn. Rosenblum plays a convict.Jane Bryan (1918-2009) plays Cagney's girlfriend. Bryan was a Warner contract player who gave good performances in films like ""Kid Galahad"" (1937) and ""A Slight Case of Murder"" (1938). She teamed with Raft in this film as well as ""Invisible Stripes"" (1939). She married millionaire Justin Dart in 1939 and retired from films.For me, Stanley Ridges (1890-1951) steals the show as a psycho convict who is fed up with the prison and especially the mis-treatment by a sadistic cop.Look for Thurston Hall (1882-1958) and Victor Jory (1902-1982) as crooked politicians. Hall is best remembered as Mr. Schuyler from TV's ""Topper"" (1953-5), although he appeared in more than 200 films. Jory was a veteran of more than 100 films, including the sadistic overseer in ""GWTW"" (1939) and as ""The Shadow"" (1940).Director William Keighley (1889-1984) did several films with Erroll Flynn (""The Prince and the Pauper"", ""Robin Hood"") as well as early gangster films (""G Men"", ""Brother Rat""). Although he never won any major awards, Keighley directed such memorable films as ""The Man who came to Dinner"" (1942)  and ""The Green Pastures"" (1936).The NY Times says ""with the brilliant acting by James Cagney and the fast-paced and hard-edged direction of William Keighley, the film clatters past like an express train."" Variety says ""Story structure is a bit thin in spots despite the best efforts of director William Keighley, who isn't always able to cover up. The loyalty theme and seeming double-cross motive becomes too involved just when the plot appears heading for a clever climax.""The top grossing films in 1939 were ""Gone with the Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Ninotchka"", ""Dodge City"", and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". ""GWTW"" swept the Oscars with wins for Best Picture, Director, Actress, and Supporting Actress. Other notable films released that year include ""Stagecoach"", ""Dark Victory"", ""Of Mice and Men"", ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"", ""Beau Geste"", ""Destry Rides Again"", ""Gunga Din"", ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Elizabeth and Essex"", and ""The Roaring Twenties"".This is an OK film, but far from excellent. Cagney has done many better films even in the gangster genre (""Public Enemy"", ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", ""The Roaring Twenties"", ""White Heat"") and there are better films for Raft too (""They Drive By Night"", ""Some Like it Hot""). But the two play well together, and despite a lumbering script, the action is keen.",3,Cagney and Raft in Prison,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,4666,"['Dawn', 'Die', '1939', 'gangster/prison', 'film',

Cagney was getting tired of  the genre' but it doesn't show here as he is the crusading good guy reporter, Frank Ross, exposing criminal activity in government. He is framed for a drunk driving murder. Raft is ""Hood"" Stacy, a career criminal, moody & menacing, not to be trifled with, even in prison. At first, Ross tries to keep his integrity & feels sure he will be sprung by his newspaper. He avoids Stacy. Eventually, they make common cause against a hated stoolie & a  sadistic guard. Ross is changing, prison is hardening him. Yet, he is still optimistic, but his faith is starting to fade as weeks turn into months. As he & Stacy become close, Stacy  convinces him that he maybe in prison a long time. Stacy has a plan in which Ross can help him escape. In a rather complicated & somewhat implasible chain of events it works. Once he's on the outside Stacy has promised to use his underworld contacts to get evidence that will set Ross free. But he is conning Ross & once free does nothing. He meets Ross' loyal girl-friend & fellow reporter, Jane (Joyce  Conover). She softens his heart & improbably he finally decides to keep his promise. This leads him back to prison where one of the conspirators that framed Ross is now serving time on an unrelated charge. Stacy then turns himself in. Meanwhile, things have been going bad for Ross. He spends lots of time in ""the hole"", being tortured by the guards that hold him responsible for Stacy's escape. Once again in prison, Stacy ""convinces"" the guy that helped frame Ross to confess to the warden during a prison riot that Ross tries to prevent. Ross is free at last returns to his old self (with the help of Jane). He has the headline of his life, & the crooked politicians are apprehended. What happens to, noble in the end,  Stacey? Well...

Thanks to Turner Classic Movies, I've been able to do a lot of that lately.  They made a lot of great movies back then but they also made a lot of clunkers that probably haven't been seen from the time they were released until TCM debuted a few years back.  Many are in between good and bad and every now and then a sleeper shows up.  Last night I enjoyed a very good movie by the name of ""Each Dawn I Die"".James Cagney and George Raft are quite a pair of actors in this strong movie about law and order in the 1930's.  Cagney plays a reporter whose tenacity uncovers a major scandal.  The scandal involves some powerful people and, to get even, they frame Cagney before he can do more harm.  He ends up in prison where he allies himself with lifer George Raft.  There are a lot of stories within the story and the prison life is examined in a sort of exposee manner.  The relationship between Cagney and Raft is well developed and serves as the core of the film.  I was impressed how well the story weaved itself through a lot of action, intrigue and diverse characters.  I could never tell for sure what was coming next.  That surprized me because one of the knocks on many of the old films is their predictability and I can attest to that from many of the old Black and Whites that I've seen over the years.The acting, directing, and writing team together to raise this to a level above good and a little short of great.  The way Cagney plays the role of a reporter is impressive because he stays with that persona throughout the movie.  There's a scene a little past the half-way point that brings it out.  However, I really appreciated the subtle way that Cagney was always playing the observer, taking time to study and analyze the situation before commiting himself.  Even then, his commitment was tempered by only going as far as the facts would safely lead him.George Raft was smooth in his role as a career gangster who'd gotten caught one (or two) times too many.  I was glad that I had the opportunity to see him in one of his better roles; he seemed to just walk through many of his later movies.  Barton McLane was great as the warden (giving us another one of those stories within a story).  By the time this movie finished I had seen plenty of action, impressive character development, social consciousness, morality and human relationship messages, and more.  I sat for awhile afterwards wondering why I had never had the opportunity to see this one before.  It's not ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" or ""White Heat"" but this is a movie that all Cagney fans need to see.  If you're not already a Cagney fan, you'll probably be one after watching ""Each Dawn I Die'.",4,The Master at Work,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,2789,"['often', 'enjoy', 'checking', 'out', 'old', 'movies', 'great', 'actors', 'past', 'Bogart', 'Gable', 'Cooper', 'Cagney', 'Thanks', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'do', 'lot', 'lately', 'made', 'lot', 'great', 'movies', 'back', 'then', 'also', 'made', 'lot', 'clunkers', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'time', 'were', 'released', 'TCM', 'debuted', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Many', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'now', 'then', 'sleeper', 'up', 'Last', 'night', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'name', 'Dawn', 'Die', 'Cagney', 'George', 'Raft', 'are', 'quite', 'pair', 'actors', 'strong', 'movie', 'law', 'order', '1930', 'Cagney', 'reporter', 'tenacity', 'major', 'scandal', 'scandal', 'powerful', 'people', 'get', 'even', 'frame', 'Cagney', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'harm', 'up', 'prison', 'where', 'lifer', 'George', 'Raft', 'are', 'lot', 'stories', 'story', 'prison', 'life', 'examined', 'sort', 'exposee', 'manner', 'relationship', 'Cagney', 'Raft', 'well', 'developed', 'core', 'film', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'weaved', 'lot', 'action', 'intrigue', 'diverse', 'characters', 'could', 'never', 'tell', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'next', 'surprized', 'one', 'knocks', 'many', 'old', 'films', 'predictability', 'can', 'attest', 'many', 'old', 'Black', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years.The', 'acting', 'directing', 'writing', 'team', 'together', 'raise', 'level', 'good', 'little', 'short', 'great', 'way', 'Cagney', 'role', 'reporter', 'impressive', 'persona', 'movie', 'scene', 'little', 'half-way', 'point', 'out', 'However', 'really', 'appreciated', 'subtle', 'way', 'Cagney', 'was', 'always', 'playing', 'observer', 'taking', 'time', 'study', 'analyze', 'situation', 'commiting', 'Even', 'then', 'commitment', 'was', 'tempered', 'only', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'facts', 'would', 'safely', 'lead', 'him.George', 'Raft', 'was', 'smooth', 'role', 'career', 'gangster', 'who', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'caught', 'one', 'two', 'times', 'too', 'many', 'was', 'glad', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'one', 'better', 'roles', 'seemed', 'just', 'walk', 'many', 'later', 'movies', 'Barton', 'McLane', 'was', 'great', 'warden', 'giving', 'one', 'stories', 'story', 'time', 'movie', 'finished', 'had', 'seen', 'plenty', 'action', 'impressive', 'character', 'development', 'social', 'consciousness', 'morality', 'human', 'relationship', 'messages', 'more', 'sat', 'awhile', 'afterwards', 'wondering', 'why', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'one', 'before', 'not', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'White', 'Heat', 'movie', 'Cagney', 'fans', 'need', 'see', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'Cagney', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'one', 'watching', 'Dawn', 'Die']",N/A

Oz it is not, but for 1939, Each Dawn I Die presents viewer insights to the jargon, code of ethics, and behavior of hardened convicts. John Wray as  Pete the prison guard barks through his lines like a rattled pit bull.  George Raft, who seemed to be forever dressed in prison garb, plays Stacey  a &quot;lifer&quot; who is sprung to aid newsreporter Ross (James Cagney)  who has been framed for manslaughter.  Cagney shows glimpses of his  emotional explosiveness as Ross breaks down befoe a parole board.  Raft is  in prime form cooly delivering lines that would make Edward G. Robinson  proud.  The prison break scenes are shot and edited realistically and  provide reference points for future prison films such as Brute Force and  Caged.  Still other scenes are highly improbable and mirorred in Hollywood  fare. ( Stacey giving himself up in front of the penitentiary, and the  warden's mushy sentimentality to name just two). These shortcomings  restricted Each Dawn I Die from attaining a higher echelon among crime  films.
