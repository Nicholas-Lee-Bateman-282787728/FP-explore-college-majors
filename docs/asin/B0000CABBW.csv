Keisha Castle-Hughes is endearing in her role as the young Pai. She keeps her spirits high and doesn't let even her ultra-grumpy, ultra-traditionalist, anti-girl-power grandfather keep her down. She really does seem like she has a destiny to fulfill. Her tribe needs somebody to ride the whale, which is their ritual tradition the next leader must pass. Problem is she's a she. No dudes there to do it. She's a natural leader and can ride the wale, so like so-what if she's a girl and her being female breaks with tradition? Her tribe and in particular ole grandfather must struggle with this. And the movie is beautifully shot, many memorable images, great performances and it manages to keep from getting corny.",4,girls want to ride a whale,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,778,"['Nice', 'tale', 'courage', 'triumph', 'adversity', 'coming', 'age', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'endearing', 'role', 'young', 'Pai', 'spirits', 'high', ""n't"", 'let', 'even', 'ultra-grumpy', 'ultra-traditionalist', 'anti-girl-power', 'grandfather', 'keep', 'down', 'really', 'seem', 'destiny', 'fulfill', 'tribe', 'somebody', 'ride', 'whale', 'ritual', 'tradition', 'next', 'leader', 'must', 'pass', 'Problem', 'dudes', 'there', 'do', 'natural', 'leader', 'can', 'ride', 'wale', 'so-what', 'girl', 'being', 'female', 'breaks', 'tradition', 'tribe', 'particular', 'ole', 'grandfather', 'must', 'struggle', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'many', 'memorable', 'images', 'great', 'performances', 'keep', 'getting', 'corny']",Whale Rider

The young must be taught the old ways but by our rules. The young always want to take risks, cut corners and have fun. It is also about death, the natural order of the dying of the light. The erosion of communities that disintegrate under the pace of 'change'-and the loss of things which will never be so again. But will the challenge put down be picked up and what will it look like for the next generation? I much preferred Ngati- a rougher, low cost production and set in an older time-well a time when New Zealand appeared to stand still but more in keeping with the story of my own community. The loss of industry, the shafting of workers for no better purpose than greed by those so far away from the damage they caused it was an obscenity. But whale rider-is uplifting. The cinematography is superb; the acting pretty damn good. The humour-a blessing and in plentiful supply.

774363,AVT2CST57MKDL,B0000CABBW,Abby,"[1, 2]","&quot;Whale Rider&quot; is a wonderful film about a young girl, Paikea, named for, according to the legend of her Maori people, rode a whale to New Zealand, and is the father of all Maoris. Paikea was meant to have a twin brother, who would have been the firstborn boy in the family, but he, along with Pai's mother, died seconds after he was born. Pai's father leaves the hospital, and his family, leaving her sympathetic grandmother, and her disappointed grandfather, the current chief of the tribe, to take care of her.As Pai grows older, she becomes more and more interested in her roots, and believes that she is destined to become a leader. This becomes even more apparent to her when a visit from her father reveals that he is starting a new life and a new family in Germany. However Pai's grandfather, Koro, has very different plans in mind. Girls are not allowed to become Maori leaders. So he begins training young local boys to be cheifs, bringing an end to his family's reign as cheifs. But Pai continues to try and prove herself, ending with an amazing sequence that leaves you with the question &quot;How on earth did they do that?&quot;Despite the plot, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is not necessarily a girl power film. Nor is it just a coming-of-age film. It is a story about the conflict between old traditions and modern development, and finding a compromise in which the two can meet. The score is really haunting and beautiful, and the filmmaking is seamless. Even the story is well developed, and very believable. And, if you really want to know the answer to the question &quot;how on earth did they do that?&quot; there is a wonderful behind the scenes segment on the DVD that will surely answer all the questions you can pose, and more.

774365,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000CABBW,A Customer,"[9, 9]","Summary:The small town Maori culture in New Zealand in which Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes), a strong-willed 12 year-old girl is being raised is dying.  At least, that's the impression her grandfather, Koro (Rawiri Paratene) has.  Koro is the leader of the town, which is made up primarily of Maori people, and he is troubled by a number of things, not the least of which is the fact that his oldest son, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), who should be following in his place, is not.  Also, Porourangi's first born son, Paikea's twin, died in childbirth, along with Porourangi's wife.  Koro, who was expecting Porourangi's son to become the next leader of the town, has been in a slump ever since.  But the real problem is Paikea, Koro's vivacious granddaughter who feels the burden of the fact that she lived when Koro really wanted a grandson.  But Paikea isn't about to let her grandfather, who despite his initial lack of interest in her has now grown to love her, witness the decline of their culture.  But Paikea is a girl, and girls have never lead the town.  Thus, she has more to overcome than just learning the ways of the ancients, she also has to illustrate how she, as a female, can be a prophetess, lead the village, and get her grandfather to accept her role in the revitalization of the village.Marshaling her Uncle Rawiri's (Grant Roa) talents and secretly supported by her grandmother, Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton), Paikea eventually teaches Koro a powerful lesson about the potential of women and the ways of the ancients.My Comments:This is an incredible movie!  It uses a touching story to explore the clash between the old and new; between Westernization and Maori culture; between traditional patriarchy and gender egalitarianism.The story is touching, convincing, and lucid.  I may have found it hard to critique the story line because I am so unfamiliar with the Maori culture, but I really couldn't see anything wrong with this story.As for the acting, it was stunning.  I was absolutely astonished by the performance of Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Maybe she was just being herself or maybe she has incredible potential.  Either way, she was the perfect choice for this role and without her, this movie never would have worked.  The rest of the cast is also excellent.  I have absolutely no criticisms of the movie on this front; the acting is superb.Everything about this movie draws you into the the world of the Maori people who, like many people around the world, are currently negotiating the clash of their culture with Western culture.  I would highly recommend this movie for everyone.",5,Great movie!!!,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,2609,"['Summary', 'small', 'town', 'Maori', 'culture', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Paikea', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'strong-willed', '12', 'year-old', 'girl', 'being', 'raised', 'dying', 'least', 'impression', 'grandfather', 'Koro', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'Koro', 'leader', 'town', 'made', 'up', 'primarily', 'Maori', 'people', 'troubled', 'number', 'things', 'not', 'least', 'fact', 'oldest', 'son', 'Porourangi', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'following', 'place', 'not', 'Also', 'Porourangi', 'first', 'born', 'son', 'Paikea', 'twin', 'died', 'childbirth', 'Porourangi', 'wife', 'Koro', 'who', 'was', 'expecting', 'Porourangi', 'son', 'become', 'next', 'leader', 'town', 'been', 'slump', 'ever', 'real', 'problem', 'Paikea', 'Koro', 'vivacious', 'granddaughter', 'who', 'burden', 'fact', 'lived', 'when', 'Koro', 'really', 'wanted', 'grandson', 'Paikea', ""n't"", 'about', 'let', 'grandfather', 'who', 'initial', 'lack', 'interest', 'now', 'grown', 'love', 'witness', 'decline', 'culture', 'Paikea', 'girl', 'girls', 'have', 'never', 'lead', 'town', 'Thus', 'more', 'overcome', 'just', 'learning', 'ways', 'ancients', 'also', 'illustrate', 'how', 'female', 'can', 'be', 'prophetess', 'lead', 'village', 'get', 'grandfather', 'accept', 'role', 'revitalization', 'village.Marshaling', 'Uncle', 'Rawiri', 'Grant', 'Roa', 'talents', 'secretly', 'supported', 'grandmother', 'Nanny', 'Flowers', 'Vicky', 'Haughton', 'Paikea', 'eventually', 'Koro', 'powerful', 'lesson', 'potential', 'women', 'ways', 'ancients.My', 'Comments', 'incredible', 'movie', 'touching', 'story', 'explore', 'clash', 'old', 'new', 'Westernization', 'Maori', 'culture', 'traditional', 'patriarchy', 'gender', 'egalitarianism.The', 'story', 'touching', 'convincing', 'lucid', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'hard', 'critique', 'story', 'line', 'am', 'so', 'unfamiliar', 'Maori', 'culture', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'story.As', 'acting', 'was', 'stunning', 'was', 'absolutely', 'astonished', 'performance', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'maybe', 'incredible', 'potential', 'way', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role', 'movie', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'have', 'absolutely', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'front', 'acting', 'superb.Everything', 'movie', 'world', 'Maori', 'people', 'who', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'are', 'currently', 'negotiating', 'clash', 'culture', 'Western', 'culture', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone']",Whale Rider

Although, having said that, the film does have a happy ending and thus ends on a positive tone.I cannot truly say that I enjoyed the film and although Keisha Castle-Hughes has been nominated for an Oscar as best actress, I think this, in itself, overstates what is a worthy film without ever being great.  In fact, although the characters are quite believable, I had some difficulty empathising with them.For Americans, which is where all films try to succeed, I would recommend another New Zealand film as an introduction to this genre.

774369,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000CABBW,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I can get rather insulted when I read reviews from people who are too ignorant to fully assess the meaning of a film before they make a blanket statement that really doesn't apply whatsoever.  It's infuriating because you can tell that the individual taking the time out of their day to review and persuade others of their opinion don't even really have a legitimate opinion because they don't really understand what they are talking about.  That isn't to say that someone who doesn't like this movie is wrong (I don't particularly love it either) but if you are going to discredit something you should be able to give a legitimate reason as to WHY you don't like it; right?So if you make a statement like `if you hate men this is the flick for you' you better be able to back that up with a reason as to why this film promotes the hatred of men.  But, Nor (yes, you), you missed the point of this film entirely (although I will credit you with at least raising the concern that this film is predictable, and you are right since it does take the `politically correct route' as you state, but please think your thoughts thoroughly for you make claims that hold no weight and make your entire review lose authenticity).`Whale Rider' is not a film set to diss tradition, nor is it a man hating bash against the elderly committed to their heritage.  `Whale Rider' is a beautifully told tale of a young New Zealander named Pai who is seeking love and affections and mutual respect from her grandfather.  Pai is facing great obstacles when dealing with the man.  Being practically raised by her grandparents after a fatal birthing leaves her twin brother and her mother dead, and her father emotionally unstable, Pai has faced a resentment from her grandfather for saddling him with unwanted responsibility.  Although she was considered a burden, he grew to love her.  But, due to traditions, Pai could not be groomed for future leadership (a privilege exclusively for firstborn males) and so when Pai attempts to train as well, her grandfather begins to fall back into his resentful feelings towards her.While I am not one to wholly embrace the overabundance of `girl power' (not because I don't believe in strong females or their empowerment but because I don't feel that Hollywood ever gives the subject any real dignity), I must say that `Whale Rider' understands how to make the subject feel heartfelt and moving.  That has a lot to do with the powerful performance given by Keisha Castle-Hughes.  She really delivers a wallop of a performance; one with depth (her eyes are so piercing) and just purity of soul.  She never forces it, for every emotion spills with a feeling of genuineness.When she cries, you cry.In the end I must say that `Whale Rider' is a beautifully made film.  It does have a predictability about it and an overwhelming feeling of manipulated emotions, especially on the outset, but they are never gratuitous and never take away from the overall impact of the film; in fact, in a way they aid it.",4,Riding high...,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,3017,"['can', 'get', 'rather', 'insulted', 'when', 'read', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'ignorant', 'fully', 'assess', 'meaning', 'film', 'make', 'blanket', 'statement', 'really', ""n't"", 'apply', 'whatsoever', 'infuriating', 'can', 'tell', 'individual', 'taking', 'time', 'day', 'review', 'persuade', 'others', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'have', 'legitimate', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'talking', ""n't"", 'say', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'love', 'either', 'are', 'going', 'discredit', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'give', 'legitimate', 'reason', 'WHY', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'right', 'So', 'make', 'statement', 'hate', 'men', 'flick', 'better', 'be', 'able', 'back', 'up', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'hatred', 'men', 'Nor', 'yes', 'missed', 'point', 'film', 'entirely', 'will', 'credit', 'least', 'raising', 'concern', 'film', 'predictable', 'are', 'right', 'take', 'politically', 'correct', 'route', 'state', 'please', 'think', 'thoughts', 'thoroughly', 'make', 'claims', 'hold', 'weight', 'make', 'entire', 'review', 'lose', 'authenticity', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'not', 'film', 'set', 'diss', 'tradition', 'man', 'hating', 'bash', 'elderly', 'committed', 'heritage', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'beautifully', 'told', 'tale', 'young', 'New', 'Zealander', 'named', 'Pai', 'who', 'seeking', 'love', 'affections', 'mutual', 'respect', 'grandfather', 'Pai', 'facing', 'great', 'obstacles', 'when', 'dealing', 'man', 'Being', 'practically', 'raised', 'grandparents', 'fatal', 'birthing', 'twin', 'brother', 'mother', 'dead', 'father', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'Pai', 'faced', 'resentment', 'grandfather', 'saddling', 'unwanted', 'responsibility', 'was', 'considered', 'burden', 'grew', 'love', 'due', 'traditions', 'Pai', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'groomed', 'future', 'leadership', 'privilege', 'exclusively', 'firstborn', 'males', 'so', 'when', 'Pai', 'train', 'as', 'well', 'grandfather', 'fall', 'back', 'resentful', 'feelings', 'her.While', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'wholly', 'embrace', 'overabundance', 'girl', 'power', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'strong', 'females', 'empowerment', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'subject', 'real', 'dignity', 'must', 'say', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'how', 'make', 'subject', 'feel', 'heartfelt', 'moving', 'lot', 'do', 'powerful', 'performance', 'given', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'really', 'wallop', 'performance', 'one', 'depth', 'eyes', 'are', 'so', 'piercing', 'just', 'purity', 'soul', 'never', 'emotion', 'feeling', 'genuineness.When', 'cry.In', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'beautifully', 'made', 'film', 'have', 'predictability', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'manipulated', 'emotions', 'especially', 'outset', 'are', 'never', 'gratuitous', 'never', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'fact', 'way', 'aid']",Whale Rider

Expecting it to be very bad, I sat through it and humiliated myself because of it. I had heard about it and that it was an art-house favorite, one can't begin to see why, it is really amateurish and doesn't tell anything new which hasn't been done in some extent by American films and most of the script is extremely weak and simplistic.Most everyone has been saying that this is so &#34;original&#34; but if you look at the history of American film, you can find many things which were borrowed. The film itself is unbelievable, and incredulous considering the lead role is played by a white little girl who doesn't really emphasize enough about the Maori culture, all she does is mop around in her sad state because her grandfather doesn't respect her because she is a girl. Not only is this film an aberration, but it insults all previous Maori culture because it pretends to be an modern artifact which wants to unite the past and the new, thing is, erasing the old ways isn't the way to do it.Males and females had distinct roles in early cultures and there was nothing wrong with that, that is how they survived until the modern world caught up with them and started removing pieces of their structure and eventually, they became integrated into the European world, which was quite a mistake, considering that is where Feminist theory had surfaced its ugly head. Most of the cast is played by annoying people who can't act, one example is the little stoner boy who is being trained in the martial arts by the grandfather, he doesn't even look like he should be there, he fights the little girl with sticks and it is the most contrived scene I have ever seen. Most of the film, if not all, is contrived in such ways. Because it is so simplistic and absurd, this film will move many simple minded dullards who can't see beyond it's pretensions, this film is evil in its most evident nature because it wants to be 'feminist' and contort the meaning of the past, so much like totalitarian states. I should warn everyone that most of it is very boring also and the ending is one of the most ludicrous things I have ever seen.

Left to live with her Grandparents Pai tries to prove her worthiness to her Grandfather but he insists his successor must be a male.The Maori claim to be descendants of the legendary Paikea who came to New Zealand riding on the back of a whale. This coastal, fishing community has maintained their close spiritual tie with whales for over a thousand years, their mutual destinies forever linked.When Koro (Pai's grandfather) decides to gather together all the young males of the tribe and teach them the ""old ways"" in the hopes of finding the next chief Pai tries to join the group but, is rudely dismissed by Koro. In desperation she cries out to the whales, asking for their assistance in her quest for acceptance.Now it is up to the whales to decide who's to be the ""chosen one."" A massive herd answers her plea by grounding themselves on the beach. The whole community unite in an attempt to save these sacred giants, seeing their impending deaths as an apocalyptic omen for the Maori people. All their efforts fail and hope is lost until Pai realizes the moment of truth has finally arrived.What a beautiful, poetic movie. Keisha Castle-Hughes is brilliant as Pai as is the whole cast.

The girl's faith in the spiritual power of her archetypal ancestry fills her with life,  power,  and an infusion of spirit.She becomes almost a feminine Christ-figure,  enduring a kind of death by spiritual crucifixion.  In this instance,  it is her own family and village who  turn their backs upon her,  reminding that Jesus said a prophet is not accepted in his own village.  How poignantly true.Oddly,  I saw this reviewed as a ""children's movie"". I am hardly a child.  Rather,  it is a timeless tale of spirit,  rejected by those of the world who expect people to be something other than what they actually are.  The heroine is about the same age as the little boy, Harvey,  in the movie ""Captain's Courageous""  which is another movie of great spiritual power,  although not about divinity.I rarely review movies,  because there are so few good movies today.  This one got its hooks in me, because of its power,  it's inspiration,  and the fine direction within the movie.  The  movie has potent imagery to show the clash of primitive culture with a modernized village life.  A good example is when the little girl chants in the Maori language, and a boy,  intent on making a farce of the tradition,  loudly passes gas,  causing a disrespectul eruption of laughter. By contrast,  our little heroine is guileless, absorbed in the TRANSCENDANCE of her blood lineage to the great ancestor,  and to the mythos of her people.On occasion,  I was reminded of the successful movie, ""Smoke Signals""  with fresh insight into an indigenous people.

The film delves into the hard questions with such ease that the casual viewer finds himself swept up in the story without really thinking about its implications.The story follows the Maori legend of the Whale Rider who came to New Zealand on the back of a whale and established a colony for his people. Every generation chooses as its chief the first born son of the current tribal chief.Problem is that the current son of the chief is an artist in Germany and hisd first born son died at birth leaving only his daughter Pai (Keisha Castle Hughes). What develops is a conflict between Pai and the old ways of the tribe represented by her grandfather. Maori actor Rawini Paratene in what should be an Oscar nominated performance plays the old chief with great power.The principle issue is empowerment and the film deals with the young girl who would be chief with great emotion. This is family filmaking of the highest order and a great film to watch over again. All in all this is what independent filmaking is about: its smart, friendly and not afraid to embrace the larger questions of life.The DVD offers a director commentary, deleted scenes, two featurettes on the making of the film and a neat soundtrack feature featuring highlights of the score by composer Lisa Gerrard.Do yourself a favor and see this one.

Such a view is a very, very limited view indeed.The Maori are a proud, warrior like people with a history that risks getting lost in this increasingly modern world.

774383,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,B0000CABBW,Chris Fung,"[24, 25]","OK, it's been a while since this movie came out, but I finally felt I had to put in my 2 cents because of some of the more recent reviews which are just plain ignant in places.First of all, the capsule: This is one of the great, great movies of all time.  It's much more subtle (and kinder) than Once Were Warriors but perhaps translates a little less immediately for people outside of Polynesia because Niki Caro, herself a Pakeha (British-descended, non-Maori) New Zealander, doesn't feel compelled to explain Maori culture to outsiders.  This reflects the increasing familiarity of many New Zealanders of all races and cultural backgrounds with Maori culture and in this respect it is the most mature bicultural film to come out of Aotearoa. However, at the same time, this does make it a bit harder for the poor old foreigners to understand or feel the more nuanced parts  of the wairua (spirit) of this movie.This is a movie that is uplifting, humane and deeply emotional. Anyone who thinks there is a ""man-bashing"" agenda here must have brought that particular mindset in with them. There are plenty of men who support Pai in the movie: her dad, her uncle, her friend Hemi (in an ungainly, preteen kind of way). Anyway, I digress.  This movie rocks, and Niki Caro, the cast, and especially Keisha Castle-Hughes (Pai), Rawiri Paratene (Koro) and Vicky Haughton (Nanny Flowers) deserve huge praise for their wonderful work.On to the more cultural stuff: First of all, if anyone has said this before then my apologies, but Koro is a modern Maori even if he has some old-fashioned ideas. He lives in the 21st century and is dealing with 21st century issues.  This idea that only white people or people who live in cities are modern is something that continues to annoy me intensely.  Although the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it, there are plenty of reasons why Koro is so desperate to find ""the one"": The hopelessness of the young people in the community, the lack of opportunity and an aimlessness that leads kids to drugs, gangs and to a systematic loss of faith in themselves and in their future.  These things are at once familiar to anyone who works with rural young people in almost any industrialized country and also specifically a local issue because of the idea among quite a few people (including, sadly some of the kids themselves) that Maori youth and in particular rural Maori youth are expendable in the market-driven, vacuous, ad-saturated world of  mainstream consumerist New Zealand society. Having spent some time in the far north of the country (in and around the Hokianga), I could recognize a lot of the kids and the older young people in the secondary characters of the movie.That said, Koro is a traditionalist within the context of his particular part of the world and he does hold to the notion that women don't have the nature to wield the kind of mana (spiritual power) that is required of a chief.  Nanny Flowers on the other hand, comes from the Arawa people where women did and do hold political power.  Moreover she herself is descended from the great chiefess Muriwai,  This is one of the reasons why she continually helps Pai and resists Koro's attempts to demean Pai just because she was born a girl.  Flowers' stance is just as ""traditional"" as Koro's so this movie (in its typical, quiet way) challenges us to not to get too comfortable with easy pigeon-holing.I also want to take issue with the people who felt the whole thing with the whales was too ""New Age-y"".  In traditional Maori understanding, specific groups of people are connected by genealogy to landscapes, rivers, mountains and other natural resources including animals and plants.  The original Whalerider, Paikea, established the link between the Ngati Konohi (the community shown in the movie) and the whales. As relatives, the whales are bound by obligations to the people, just as the people are bound by obligation to the whales. Koro's inability to call to the ancestors reflects the fact that he has lost some part of his mana as a descendant of Paikea because of his foolish adherence to the form of tradition, rather than its spirit.  The whales beach not because Pai called them too close to the shore, but because their plight mirrors the plight of the people (directionless, failing and blind).  This issue was downplayed by the director, and is the only place where, in my  humble opinion, Niki Caro's instincts as a film-maker perhaps over-rode the need for an explicit narrative to the detriment of the film as a whole.The whole issue of how to blend the ""traditional"" with the ""modern"" is the central axis of this movie.  It's just a guess but I think that the reason why this movie was so incredibly popular when it finally made it here to Hawai`i was that it suggested that you can marry the two (tradition and modernity) together.  That traditions can be changed without losing their ability to keep people strong and moral. That while traditions are the root that makes the tree strong, the branches of the tree should adapt to their own specific situation.  The question of how to apply traditional ideas to modern contexts is one of the big issues facing colonized and disenfranchised peoples everywhere.However, (and let me be clear about this) this is a different issue from the idea of cultural authenticity and cultural identity. No-one would argue that Europeans (or Euro-Americans, or Euro-New Zealanders) should practice 18th century European culture in order to be considered ""authentic"" white people.  Why the heck should native people be held to a different standard?One thing that might make some of this clearer, is to watch the ""making of"" documentary in the special features part of the DVD. This is a really nice piece of documentary film-making and it gives a much better sense of the real Maori community who hosted the film crew but also the tremendous pride and sense of connection that the actors and crew (both Maori and Pakeha) felt to the community and to the wairua that lies behind the film.  Without the real people and the real culture, this would have just been a pretty story in a beautiful landscape.  The reality is much, much deeper.One other thing that might help people understand Whale Rider a little better is to learn a bit more about Maori culture.  Some suggestions are:  novels: ""The Bone People"" by Keri Hulme; anything by Witi Ihimaera (including the book the movie was based on ""The Whale Rider"" although for my money, ""Tangi"" is better), and Patricia Grace's ""Potiki"". In non-fiction:  ""Making Peoples"" by James Belich, ""Two Worlds"" by Anne Salmond, ""Tikanga Whakaaro"" by Cleve Barlow (fairly rare these days but a great resource as is Hiwi and Pat Tauroa's ""A guide to customs and protocol""), ""Tikanga Maori"" by Hirini Mead which is also very good but much denser and Linda Tuhiwai Smith's ""Decolonizing Methodologies"".  Avoid anything by Alan Duff until you have some familiarity with what's really going on in Maori culture.  Once you know something, you can also go back and look at movies like ""Once Were Warriors"" and ""Utu"" and appreciate the things they say (and don't say).Niki Caro, Witi Ihimaera and the cast and crew of Whale Rider have made a beautiful and memorable addition to world literature.  It's great as a story about an individual, but it's true greatness comes as a story about a people.",5,Blending tradition and modernity,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,7392,"['OK', 'been', 'while',

Due to being a girl, she is disowned by her grandfather for not being able to obtain the ritual inheritance of the Maori tribe, descendants of the legendary Paikea, who arrived from Hawaaki `riding on a whale'. In desperation for acceptance she sneaks around her grandfather's all male initiation camp to learn the ways of becoming a wise leader. Through her grandfather's failure as ""wise leader"" to pass on his inheritance to any one boy in the camp, the sacred symbol ""whale tooth"" is lost for what he deems forever. Now it's up to the whales to decide who will be the chosen leader.Out of desperation to be accepted by her grandfather and following descendants, Pai so skillfully calls on the whales in asking for acceptance. A large herd of whales answers by fleeing to the shores of this coastal, fishing community. The whole Maori tribe flees to save these symbolic creatures. The grandfather, still not understanding ""who's to blame"" seeks to remove them from the mainline shore. When all attempts fail by the whole community, Pai finally realizes that her time has come. Through faith of her eternal calling she is given the opportunity to save the whales and the heritage of the Maori tribe; thus turning her grandfather's disregard into acceptance. A very informative film on the customs and rituals many even today still strive to overcome.In relation to our world religions, it shows the comparison of how male dominance is still such as issue for many beliefs yet how far we've come even in today's society. Norms of marrying within your `tribe or race' is dominant even today as this movie will show. All people of different faiths are striving to become accepted in some form or another.

Although he's eventually come to care for her, he's always been somewhat distant and indifferent to her special capabilities, so time and time again she tries to win his affections - to make him proud of her - but she was not the son her grandfather was expecting and a part of him loathed her very existence because of that.

I don't see that as much as I see &quot;people power&quot;.  The hero of the story is a heroine.  She happens to be a girl in a dying male dominated Maori.  Her being a female excludes her - but it could have been anything that made her an outsider.  And this otherness blinds the grandfather to all her magnificent qualities.  And the blindness creates more hurt and loneliness than should be borne by anyone.  The young girl, Pai, has such strength that her ache is not a burden so much as it is a furnace that heats her passion for the sacred in her culture.  She will not stop or quit.  She cannot be discouraged by the hurt and pain in her life because she has never known anything else.  She demands her own place and her own life not be defeating anyone else, but by simply taking her own place without asking permission.  She becomes a source of strength and uplift for everyone else.Pai's is a quiet determination.  She cannot be dominated, but she doesn't destroy that which rejects her.  She ignores that which rejects her while embracing and nourishing herself on the Maori legends.  She is just a magnificent person and the actress who plays her is superb.  Well, the whole cast is superb.  You will want to watch it with your whole family because of the strength of this child and the way it handles family pain.

774387,A1S1O3YT8NS68A,B0000CABBW,crazyforgems,"[1, 3]","""Whale Rider"" is not your everday girl power movie.The heroine, Paikea(Keisha Castle-Hughes), is the granddaughter of a New Zealand chief and the descendant of the famous Paikea, who supposedly rode a whale through the South Seas to New Zealand. Her grandfather has been awaiting the next male chief: alas, his oldest son (whom it has to be) becomes an artist and his oldest son dies at birth. But he leaves a twin sister...and that is the lovely Paikea who wants nothing more than to be the next chief.Ah but her grandfather has different ideas. THough he cares for her, he grows to believe that since her birth (she's about 13 in the movie), everything bad has happened. He tries to establish a school for boys to teach them ""old ways""; Paikea learns these ways on the sly. The more she tries, the angrier her grandfather becomes.Though this movie deals with such noble themes as leadership and the mystical relationship humans can have with animals, its settings are quite mundane. The families live in modest though modern houses. The school is adequate though threadbare. Children are born in hospitals.

Keisha Castle-Hughes gives an oscar worthy performance (maybe that's why she was nominated) and the film as a whole, while far from perfect, gives a whallop of a punch in the end.  The story of Pai, a young New Zealand girl who is hated then loved then hated again by her grandfather, is a truly heartfelt and moving story to say the least.  In their culture they believe that a firstborn son will become leader of the people.  The problem is that Pai's twin brother (who would in essence be the firstborn) died at birth and Pai, the daughter, was all that was left.  Her father, in haste and depression for losing not only his son but also his wife (she dies giving birth), leaves her in the custody of his parents.  His father is burdened by this and resents Pai for it, but as time passes he falls in love with her, until time comes for him to train the other firstborn SONS in the village for leadership and she tries to succeed herself.  The story is more a story of love than anything else.  Pai doesn't want to hurt her grandfather or defame her culture, she just wants to earn love and respect from her grandfather, a man whom she honors and respects and values dearly, loves as a she would love a father because he is the only father she's ever known.  There is a scene where she relates a spoken word essay about her culture and about her grandfather, and as she speaks in broken words and short breaths as tears fall down her face I (as well as my wife) were brought to tears for this beautiful girl, beautiful in both spirit and soul and that's what brings me to my title, Keisha Castle-Hughes, because simply put this young actress is astounding...she gave more heart in her performance then I've seen from a lot of leading ladies these days and so I am glad to see that she was honored by a nomination at such a young age.",4,Keisha Castle-Hughes,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,1884,"['film', 'lot', 'heart', 'sure', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'maybe', 'why', 'was', 'nominated', 'film', 'whole', 'far', 'perfect', 'whallop', 'punch', 'end', 'story', 'Pai', 'young', 'New', 'Zealand', 'girl', 'who', 'hated', 'then', 'loved', 'then', 'hated', 'again', 'grandfather', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'moving', 'story', 'say', 'least', 'culture', 'believe', 'firstborn', 'son', 'will', 'become', 'leader', 'people', 'problem', 'Pai', 'twin', 'brother', 'who', 'would', 'essence', 'be', 'firstborn', 'died', 'birth', 'Pai', 'daughter', 'was', 'was', 'left', 'father', 'haste', 'depression', 'losing', 'not', 'only', 'son', 'also', 'wife', 'giving', 'birth', 'custody', 'parents', 'father', 'burdened', 'resents', 'Pai', 'time', 'love', 'time', 'train', 'other', 'firstborn', 'SONS', 'village', 'leadership', 'succeed', 'story', 'more', 'story', 'love', 'anything', 'else', 'Pai', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'grandfather', 'defame', 'culture', 'just', 'earn', 'love', 'respect', 'grandfather', 'man', 'whom', 'honors', 'respects', 'values', 'dearly', 'would', 'love', 'father', 'only', 'father', 'ever', 'known', 'scene', 'where', 'spoken', 'word', 'essay', 'culture', 'grandfather', 'broken', 'words', 'short', 'breaths', 'tears', 'fall', 'down', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'wife', 'were', 'brought', 'tears', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'spirit', 'soul', 'what', 'title', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'simply', 'put', 'young', 'actress', 'astounding', 'gave', 'more', 'heart', 'performance', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'leading', 'ladies', 'days', 'so', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'was', 'honored', 'nomination', 'young', 'age']",Whale Rider

Unfortunately, it was also one of the most underrated films of that year.  Its powerful message catches many audiences' hearts, especially the theme of twelve-year-old Pai being ignored by her live-in grandfather.  The writing wonderfully expresses every emotional aspect.  It doesn't miss a single drop of it for a second.  This film becomes an emotional rollercoaster as Pai struggles to find her place in life on her own.  As she overcomes many odds, the dramatic theme arises while the sense of hope feels closer.  The film becomes more interesting as Pai breaks the gender barriers, namely when her grandfather says, &quot;only boys allowed.&quot;  Such happenings deserve tremendous respect for the writers.Talented child actors are very rare.  Keisha Castle-Hughes proves in her role as Pai that she is truly talented.  This emotional role earns her the title as the youngest Oscar nominee for Best Actress at age 13.  Her heart and soul is present through every scene.  Her hardhitting emotional scenes are incredible.

Not smarty-pants indies about losers spewing pop-culture reference, not four-way split-screen showoffs, and not jaded Gaspar Noe-style gorefests.  Rather, Whale Rider is an intimate, heartfelt story told with complete earnesty with skill and expressiveness, with acting to die for.The enchanting Keisha Castle-Hughes deserves an Oscar nomination for a soulful, rich performance as Pai, the last heir in a long line of Maori chieftains, and an end to the bloodline according to tradition, by virtue of being a girl.  The heartbreaking opening sequence immediately sets the acting and emotional bars high, gripping the audience right off the bat.  One of the best openings of any film I've ever seen.  And when Castle-Hughes launches into the monologue that is the emotional core of the film, it's a moment of pure magic.  The last child performance with this level of emotional depth that I can remember is Jena Malone in Bastard Out of Carolina -- all the more impressive considering it's Castle-Hughes' first film.  She is definitely a star in the making, an actor of rare gift.The rest of the cast is equally stellar:  Rawiri Paratene achieves just the right balance between gravity and likeability as Pai's grandfather Koro, making him the best kind of antagonist -- the one we sympathize with.  Vicky Haughton as Nanny and the incredibly versatile Cliff Curtis as Porourangi offer stirling supporting performances.Aside from one or two minute editing choices in the dialogue scenes, I really find no flaw in this film.  The pacing slows down greatly near the end, but all to good effect; the cinematography is beautiful; director Niki Caro's shot choices and writing are both sharp and engaging; and Lisa Gerrard is in her element her, offering a minimalistic and repetitive, yet perfectly tailored score which serves the film well.  I'm not a big fan of all her work, finding her tendency to always use exotic music styles sometimes irritating (especially in The Insider, whose specific American angle was compromised by Gerrard's chants), but in Whale Rider, Gerrard is the perfect choice for a composer.A gripping emotional experience, and a truly fine film that scales the heights.",5,A beautiful film that fills a much-needed void in cinema.,1061164800,"08 18, 2003",2003,2232,"['kind', 'film', 'need', 'more', 'Not', 'smarty-pants', 'indies', 'losers', 'spewing', 'pop-culture', 'reference', 'not', 'four-way', 'split-screen', 'showoffs', 'not', 'jaded', 'Gaspar', 'Noe-style', 'gorefests', 'Rather', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'intimate', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'told', 'complete', 'earnesty', 'skill', 'expressiveness', 'acting', 'die', 'for.The', 'enchanting', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'soulful', 'rich', 'performance', 'Pai', 'last', 'heir', 'long', 'line', 'Maori', 'chieftains', 'end', 'bloodline', 'according', 'tradition', 'virtue', 'being', 'girl', 'heartbreaking', 'opening', 'sequence', 'immediately', 'acting', 'emotional', 'bars', 'high', 'gripping', 'audience', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'One', 'best', 'openings', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'when', 'Castle-Hughes', 'monologue', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'moment', 'pure', 'magic', 'last', 'child', 'performance', 'level', 'emotional', 'depth', 'can', 'remember', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Bastard', 'Out', 'Carolina', 'more', 'impressive', 'considering', 'Castle-Hughes', 'first', 'film', 'definitely', 'star', 'making', 'actor', 'rare', 'gift.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'stellar', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'gravity', 'likeability', 'Pai', 'grandfather', 'Koro', 'making', 'best', 'kind', 'antagonist', 'one', 'sympathize', 'Vicky', 'Haughton', 'Nanny', 'incredibly', 'versatile', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Porourangi', 'offer', 'stirling', 'supporting', 'performances.Aside', 'one', 'two', 'minute', 'editing', 'choices', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'really', 'find', 'flaw', 'film', 'pacing', 'down', 'greatly', 'end', 'good', 'effect', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'director', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'shot', 'choices', 'writing', 'are', 'sharp', 'engaging', 'Lisa', 'Gerrard', 'element', 'her', 'offering', 'minimalistic', 'repetitive', 'yet', 'perfectly', 'tailored', 'score', 'film', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'work', 'finding', 'tendency', 'always', 'use', 'exotic', 'music', 'styles', 'sometimes', 'irritating', 'especially', 'Insider', 'specific', 'American', 'angle', 'was', 'compromised', 'Gerrard', 'chants', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'Gerrard', 'perfect', 'choice', 'composer.A', 'gripping', 'emotional', 'experience', 'truly', 'fine', 'film', 'heights']",Whale Rider

Somehow, it encapsulates in a timely fashion what has become the greatest challenge to ALL of our tribes, the painful and challenging encounter between the modern world, and the archaic realities.Each of us blindly and steadfastly carries on the traditions of the culture into which we were born. For many, loyalty and adherrance to tradition and ceremony give them their most important sense of identity and the greatest meaning to their lives. To suggest that they abandon these traditions, or alter them, can be the most threatening experience they can know.And yet...A crab, a snake, even a toad must shed its skin in order to grow larger. If evolution and growth mean constant change, how can one be rigidly loyal to a tradition and yet nurture and support helpful, healing growth? This issue lies at the heart of this story.When one is deep in a tradition, it is easy to forget the original, monumental events that gave rise to the perseverance of the tradition in the first place. These events are always seminal. They are primary. They frequently define the prevailing fashions in terms of shock! and awe! They are generally a significant and dramatic breakthrough of some kind. Then comes the repetition of blind submission to the symbols of the original events.In this film, the conflict between hide bound adherance to the old, and natures attempt to create something new and fresh, give rise to a great struggle between the present and the past that ultimately is only reconciled when the mighty voices of the Old Ones speak, with ultimate authority, what can only be the final word on the subject.There is so much to be enriched by, spiritually, in this film that it is almost too much to bear.

This movie is based upon fiction mixed with mythology and legend and should be perceived as such - failure to understand this might lead one to think the spirituality of it is overdone. This was the same plight for desenters of ""Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon"" who complained about the unrealistic martial art moves.""Whale Rider"" is so much more than just a young girl who would become leader. This movie will not disappoint. BTW, I reserve full five stars for what I consider best in genre and this is very close but I still think ""Ran"" has this one beat.

774400,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0000CABBW,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[20, 21]","&quot;Whale Rider&quot; is one of the best movies this year, and probably will be remembered as such at the end of 2003. It's full of haunting imagery, thought-provoking handling of universal themes, and family conflict. And there's a bit of the awe-inspiring and magical near the end as well.When Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) was born, her mother and twin brother died. Her heartbroken father fled to Europe, leaving her in the care of her rigidly traditional grandfather Koro (Rawiri Paratene). Years later, Pai longs for her grandfather's approval, but he secretly blames her for the troubles plaguing the Maori -- especially since there is now no heir, as girls can't lead. Koro, we're told, wants a savior for the Maori tribe of Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti. Now Koro begins training young boys in how to be chiefs, and Pai secretly learns as well (against Koro's orders).When the final test of the boys fails completely, the heartbroken Koro calls out to the Ancient Ones (whales), one of which, according to legend, brought the first person to New Zealand. But they don't come for the old chief. Pai calls them as well -- only to bring disaster when the whales beach themselves near her home. To save the Ancient Ones, an old teacher must learn to break traditions, and a young one learns her true place.Though the lead of this movie is a child, there is no cuteness, no dumbness, no talking-down. The moviemakers clearly respect the cast, the people it represents, and the wealth of legend and myth behind them. It feels so real that you could reach through and touch them. But the content in it is universal -- sometimes traditions should bow to what is needed, and they need to change for the people who honor them to survive.Neither Pai nor Koro will leave you untouched; Pai hurts Koro by breaking the rules, while he hurts her by treating her as unworthy. The scene where she makes a speech praising him and their culture is heartbreaking, as she struggles to speak through her tears. Similarly, the moment when Koro realizes that he was wrong about Pai is amazing. This careful attention to the characterization shows the care that went into &quot;Whale Rider.&quot;Direction is outstanding -- simple lines have great weight, dialogue is entirely believable, and the scenes are often carried just by the look on the actors' faces. There's a feeling of purity to the way it's directed, a freshness and beauty that shows in full near the finale. New Zealand is shown off at its best in wide scenic shots. And the climactic scene with the whales is nothing short of brilliant -- it will take your breath away.Keisha Castle-Hughes is absolutely priceless; she has genuine talent, rather than the hamminess or woodenness that many young actors have. Rawiri Paratene is excellent as a man with a heavy burden who is getting more and more desperate; you won't like all he does, but he's an incredibly sympathetic character just the same. The supporting cast is also amazing, including Vicki Haughton as Pai's strong-willed grandmother and Cliff Curtis as her dad.With remarkable performances, a simple, powerful message, and a brilliant storyline, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is a film that should be seen again and again.",5,Ride the whale,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,3218,"['quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'such', 'end', '2003', 'full', 'haunting', 'imagery', 'thought-provoking', 'handling', 'universal', 'themes', 'family', 'conflict', 'bit', 'awe-inspiring', 'magical', 'end', 'well.When', 'Paikea', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'was', 'born', 'mother', 'twin', 'brother', 'died', 'Her', 'heartbroken', 'father', 'fled', 'Europe', 'leaving', 'care', 'rigidly', 'traditional', 'grandfather', 'Koro', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'Years', 'later', 'Pai', 'grandfather', 'approval', 'secretly', 'troubles', 'plaguing', 'Maori', 'especially', 'now', 'heir', 'girls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lead', 'Koro', ""'re"", 'told', 'savior', 'Maori', 'tribe', 'Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti', 'Now', 'Koro', 'training', 'young', 'boys', 'how', 'be', 'chiefs', 'Pai', 'secretly', 'as', 'well', 'Koro', 'orders', '.When', 'final', 'test', 'boys', 'completely', 'heartbroken', 'Koro', 'out', 'Ancient', 'Ones', 'whales', 'one', 'according', 'legend', 'brought', 'first', 'person', 'New', 'Zealand', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'old', 'chief', 'Pai', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'bring', 'disaster', 'when', 'whales', 'beach', 'home', 'save', 'Ancient', 'Ones', 'old', 'teacher', 'must', 'learn', 'break', 'traditions', 'young', 'one', 'true', 'lead', 'movie', 'child', 'cuteness', 'dumbness', 'talking-down', 'moviemakers', 'clearly', 'respect', 'cast', 'people', 'wealth', 'legend', 'myth', 'so', 'real', 'could', 'reach', 'touch', 'content', 'universal', 'sometimes', 'traditions', 'should', 'bow', 'what', 'needed', 'need', 'change', 'people', 'who', 'honor', 'survive.Neither', 'Pai', 'Koro', 'will', 'leave', 'untouched', 'Pai', 'Koro', 'breaking', 'rules', 'treating', 'unworthy', 'scene', 'where', 'speech', 'praising', 'culture', 'heartbreaking', 'speak', 'tears', 'Similarly', 'moment', 'when', 'Koro', 'was', 'wrong', 'Pai', 'amazing', 'careful', 'attention', 'characterization', 'care', 'went', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider.', 'quot', 'Direction', 'outstanding', 'simple', 'lines', 'have', 'great', 'weight', 'dialogue', 'entirely', 'believable', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'carried', 'just', 'look', 'actors', 'feeling', 'purity', 'way', 'directed', 'freshness', 'beauty', 'full', 'finale', 'New', 'Zealand', 'shown', 'off', 'best', 'wide', 'scenic', 'shots', 'climactic', 'scene', 'whales', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'Castle-Hughes', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'genuine', 'talent', 'rather', 'hamminess', 'woodenness', 'many', 'young', 'actors', 'have', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'excellent', 'man', 'heavy', 'burden', 'who', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'desperate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'incredibly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'just', 'same', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'amazing', 'including', 'Vicki', 'Haughton', 'Pai', 'strong-willed', 'grandmother', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'dad.With', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'simple', 'powerful', 'message', 'brilliant', 'storyline', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'again']",Whale Rider
774401,A2UCOSEHTW6I0H,B0000CABBW,Eddie Konczal,"[9, 10]","Two of 2003's best movies were filmed in New Zealand. Both featured great creatures and small heroes, and both ended with exotic ships sailing into the sea.  But there the similarities end.  For one was the grand, multiple-Oscar winning, special-effects laden, fantasy epic ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.""  The other was ""Whale Rider,"" a relatively low-budget picture about a Maori girl coming of age. Both films are equally astonishing in their own ways.Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is a girl who survives the deaths of both her mother and twin brother during childbirth.  While the family grieves, Paikea's grandfather, Koro, suffers an additional loss, for Paikea's twin brother was the expected male heir to the family's noble line of prophets, who descended from a legendary ""Whale Rider.""  The rest of the film deals with the complicated family dynamic between Paikea, Koro, and Paikea's father, Porourangi, who resents Koro's old-fashioned ways and flees to Germany to pursue a career as an artist.  Paikea comes to realize the importance of her family's legacy, and struggles to achieve it while also striving for the affection and acceptance of her grandfather.The driving force behind ""Whale Rider"" is a brilliant performance by first-time actress Keisha Castle-Hughes as Paikea.  Before seeing ""Whale Rider,"" I was astonished that she was nominated for an Oscar; after seeing it, I wished she would have won.  The supporting cast is uniformly strong; special mention goes to Rawiri Paratene, who deftly navigates Koro's conflicting feelings for Paikea.  The story is simple enough, but populated with profound themes on familial relationships, issues of gender equality, and environmental concerns.  Director Niki Caro wisely avoids overindulging in location photography; she captures the Maori milieu as much from the faces of her actors as from their surroundings.""Whale Rider"" succeeds on many levels: it's epic and intimate, exciting and educational, humorous and heartbreaking.

Her father (played by the excellent Cliff Curtis) leaves New Zealand after he loses both his wife and Paikea's twin brother in childbirth. Pai's grandfather is the strictly traditional Maori tribal chief whose hopes for the future of their tribe rested with and died with the birth of the baby boy. The grandfather is struggling against modernism, struggling to maintain tradition and to educate a new generation of young Maori men. He is resentful that the baby who was born to be leader of the tribe has been taken away; his own son cannot face the reality and runs away, leaving the resentful grandfather to rear Paikea. The son has not only shirked his family responsibilities and tribal responsibilities, he has left behind his useless daughter. The baby son had been ""the chosen one"", the grandfather believes, as the ""whale rider"" and uniter of the tribe must be male. Paikea, in stark contrast to her grandfather who barely tolerates her, loves and reveres her grandfather more than anything, but is strongly drawn to the Maori traditions and customs, constantly defying her grandfather's stubborn opposition to her learning or participating in men's Maori customs. When Pai's father returns from Europe, the grandfather sees a glimmer of hope, trying to unite him with a Maori woman- only to have his son Porourangi reveal that he has a pregnant German girlfriend back home. The grandfather is livid, and Paikea is going to leave to go to Germany to live with her father. New Zealand, though, mysteriously beckons her to stay. She continues to defy her grandfather, enlisting her uncle to teach her the warrior ways. Eventually her grandfather shuns her entirely; Pai is heartbroken. His stubbornness not only hurts Pai deeply, it stands in the way of progress, acceptance and the dreams he holds dearest for the future of his people.

774411,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B0000CABBW,General Breadbasket,"[3, 11]","""Whale Rider"", a New Zealand film, is a story about a Maori tribe in modern times, with a twist of their tales and tradition thrown in. It's based on the 1987 novel of the same name. I thought I'd like it much more than I actually did, unfortunately.Pai is a twelve year old Maori girl, the latest in a line of chiefs, an only daughter, very passionate about her people and culture, and who loves her grandfather, the chief of their region, very much. Daughters cannot go on to be chiefs, no matter how passionate they are, that is the tradition, and a tradition Pai's grandfather is determined to keep. Deciding to ignore his daughter completely, the old chief calls together all the Maori boys in the community, teaching them the old ways, the whats and the whys. In secret, Pai spys on them, learning the old ways too, creating an even bigger rift between her grandfather, a rift he refuses to mend.I found it was rather serious and melodramatic (the dialogue, the shots, the music, the acting) like there was (or had to be) significance in everything that happened in the story. There was very little humour, which is a shame, because I'm sure I would have enjoyed the film a bit more if it had. The Maoris have a great sense of humour in real life, and its lacking a bit here. This film makes them out to be very stressed and intense, for the most part. Ah well.

This movie is no exception.The movie is based on an creation myth of some of the Maori people who believe that Paikea, their ancestor,  came to the area on the back of a whale which rescued him when his canoe overturned.  Drawing on this myth, New Zealand writer, Witi Ihimaera, wrote the book on which this movie is based while he was living in New York, when he saw a whale spouting in the Hudson River. The movie has come about eighteen years after the book.The movie centers on the relationship between a twelve-year-old Maori girl, Pai, who is cared for by her grandfather, Koro, a tribal chief, and his wife Nanny Flowers. Koro, who is eager to ensure tribal succesion, trains the first-born twelve year old boys of the community in the requsiite Maori traditions for leadership, but refuses to admit Pai to these classes over her vocal protests.Pai nonetheless secretly eavesdrops on these classes and begins to master the use of the traditional Maori club.I will sparing some other details which should however not be missed when you watch this. The movie reaches a dramatic climax after a group of whales are beached and are doomed to languish until Pai attempts a dramatic feat which nearly costs her life. After this ordeal, she is finally accepted as heir to the tribe which finds renewed strength after this.There is a palpable emotional depth to this movie which comes across not in the dialogue, but in the moving facial expressions and the silent language which binds this community.",4,"A portrayal of myth, feminism and adaptation",1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,1669,"['have', 'invariably', 'found', 'contrary', 'expectation', 'movies', 'New', 'Zealand', 'have', 'grim', 'dark', 'aspect', 'gorgeous', 'pastoral', 'landscapes', 'also', 'offer', 'movie', 'exception.The', 'movie', 'based', 'creation', 'myth', 'Maori', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'Paikea', 'ancestor', 'came', 'area', 'back', 'whale', 'rescued', 'when', 'canoe', 'overturned', 'Drawing', 'myth', 'New', 'Zealand', 'writer', 'Witi', 'Ihimaera', 'wrote', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'was', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'saw', 'whale', 'spouting', 'Hudson', 'River', 'movie', 'come', 'eighteen', 'years', 'book.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'relationship', 'twelve-year-old', 'Maori', 'girl', 'Pai', 'who', 'cared', 'grandfather', 'Koro', 'tribal', 'chief', 'wife', 'Nanny', 'Flowers', 'Koro', 'who', 'eager', 'ensure', 'tribal', 'succesion', 'first-born', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'community', 'requsiite', 'Maori', 'traditions', 'leadership', 'admit', 'Pai', 'classes', 'vocal', 'protests.Pai', 'nonetheless', 'secretly', 'classes', 'master', 'use', 'traditional', 'Maori', 'club.I', 'will', 'sparing', 'other', 'details', 'should', 'however', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'group', 'whales', 'are', 'beached', 'are', 'doomed', 'languish', 'Pai', 'dramatic', 'feat', 'nearly', 'life', 'ordeal', 'finally', 'accepted', 'heir', 'tribe', 'renewed', 'strength', 'palpable', 'emotional', 'depth', 'movie', 'not', 'dialogue', 'moving', 'facial', 'expressions', 'silent', 'language', 'community']",Whale Rider

This could easily be a National Geographic documentary for all its beauty of New Zealand. But it has much more: the little known Maori people of New Zealand have been celebrated by such well known descendants as soprano Kiri Te Kanawa who introduces Maori folksongs on her highly lauded performances throughout the world, but rarely have we been given the insights into a wondrous strange reflection of our tribal beginnings as we have here.WHALE RIDER is a simple tale of a tribe who are dependent upon the firstborn males to carry on the wisdom of the ancients. When Piakea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is born her twin MALE brother dies as does her mother.  Paikea's claim to the line of chieftains is denied by her grandfather and the townspeople, only serving to encourage Paikea to prove that she is deserving of the role to which she feels she is born.  The means by which she gains her rightful place fill out this story.  There is a tearful speech about her history and beliefs that brings tears to everyone's eyes, and there is a panoramic miracle of whales beaching that is staggering in its impact.To this reviewer's eyes it is the skill of the Director Niki Caro that deserves the accolades being heaped on Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Yes, she performs well and is directed keenly and sympathetically by Caro through some lovely scenes, but is this &quot;performance&quot; really deserving of an Oscar when such brilliant actors such as Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Frances McDormand, etc etc have polished their craft through long commitment?

The Whangara tribe's faith derives from Paikea, the first Whale Rider. Like many tribal religion, their tribe faces the threats of extinction when the Koro's son fails to give him a male heir to the tribe. Pai, his only daughter, not only faces being orphaned by her father (who left the tribe not being able to face his wife and son's death), but the rejection of her grandfather as the one who would carry on their tribe's legacy. When Pai's father returns, Koro hopes he would become the next chief, but he is gravely disappointed. Pai's father leaves the village once more, this time taking her with him. But, Pai returns. However, Koro continues to become more and more distant towards Pai, believing that she will never be able to fulfill the roles of a Chief in their tribe, even though his wife continues to tell him so. Koro becomes more stressed with the emergence of a beached whale, thinking that it is a sign for the worse. He and the other tribe's people struggle to save its life, but they are unable to. Pai's ability to lead the whale back to safety is finally tested, and with it she gains the title of the Whale Rider, as well as the respect and adoration of Koro.The Whangara people focus on their ancestral values, animism, and they also embody earth-focused beliefs. This movie not only shows these beliefs in action, but also embodies the struggles that many tribal religions have to face in the world today; movement of their people into the outside world. People leave to find better lives and quickly become accustomed to the lifestyle, never to return to their homes. It also shows the struggle to survive and maintain tradition with the daily threats of the outside world.

I wanted to like this. I really did. After reading so many great reviews in so many publications I was looking forward to a non-Hollywood uplifting tale. What I got was a slow and dull borefest.First of all, I cannot fathom how Keisha Castle-Hughes is nominated for an academy award. Her performance is minimal. Perhaps this is supposed to be her character but I have not seen a more monosyllabic display since Sylvester Stallone took on the role of John Rambo in First Blood. All she does is stand around, looking detached and sullen. Anybody can do that. I do admit that she did a good job crying during the scene with her speech. But big Arnie cried in End of Days and I don't see anyone handing him and Oscar.In regards to the rest of the cast, there is NO character development. There are some hints but nothing is ever explained. Like why does Pai love her grandfather so much when he is horrid towards her? What's the deal with her uncle smoking crack? Hardly the kind of thing appropriate for a family movie? What does being the leader of the tribe actually mean?According to her grandfather's 'leader lessons', being a tribe leader means nothing more than practicing for war. That's all he teaches. War, war, war. What's that got to do with sitting on the back of a whale and riding about the ocean? I don't know much about Maori tribes but I think that this is a completely outrageous representation of them. This could be intentional as the grandfather is supposed to be out of touch with his true tribal senses but nothing excuses the scene in which he tells a group of 10-year-old boys to place their severed enemy's heads on a stick as an example to others. I'm sorry but there is a word for that kind of behaviour. It's called 'WAR CRIMES'. Another thing I think is totally inappropriate for a family movie. And it's also pretty Xenophobic.What boggles the mind is how I've heard of so many people telling me they cried at this film. Cried at WHAT exactly? There is no major emotional revelation at any part of the film. The ending is totally inconclusive. Just a bunch of guys in a big boat, chanting. Why would I cry at this? And where are they going?I will give the film credit for having a few brief (very brief) atmospherical moments during the narration scenes. But nothing ever becomes of them. There is no complication or sophistication to this film at all. It builds and 'resolves' in the most simplistic and dull way. I would not recommend this as a family movie.

Keisha Castle-Hughes stands out as Pai, a teenage girl determined to take part in the coming-of-age rituals which she feels is her birth right.  The only problem is that she is a girl and has to get past her rigid Grandfather in order to do so.The movie tries to balance modern-day realities against age-old customs, while offering an optimistic view of Maori life. It builds slowly to its dramatic end. Pai is dealt a cruel blow when her grandfather refuses to train her in the ancient rituals.  Her grandfather is the spiritual leader of the village and hasn't been able to overcome the fact that neither of his sons have been able to give him a grandson.  She had chosen to stay in the village rather than go off to Europe with her father.  Pai's grandmother offers some solace, but ultimately Pai has to take matters into her own hands when a pod of whales is left stranded on the beach.  She had learned the rituals from her uncle, who sees in Pai what her grandfather is unable to.  Pai has a natural calling for whales and feels it was her fault that the whales beached themselves.The scenes are evocatively handled and one sees much of the beauty in Maori culture with very little of the harsh realities.

This is a poignant and powerful coming of age tale and also the story of a people who are struggling to maintain their identity and the old ways. There are strong mythical components to the film. The underwater shots of whales, and a young girl who seems to sense their presence and commune with them, are mystical and breathtaking. And the scenes of Maori dance and the narration of their mythology are extraordinary.The film is set on the eastern coast of New Zealand, which is inhabited by an ancient people, the Whangara. The narrator is a wonderfully expressive young actress, Keisha Castle-Hughes. She gives a riveting performance as Paikea, (called Pai), a twelve year-old Maori girl with the blood of royalty in her veins and the heart of a warrior in her chest. The movie opens with Pai narrating a Whangara myth. Legend has it that the native people came to New Zealand following their leader, Paikea, (who Pai is named for), a boy who heroically rode on the back of a whale. Traditionally, tribal leadership has always gone to the direct descendants of that first leader and always to the first born male of the noble line. Tragedy occurs, however, when fraternal twins are born into that line, a boy and a girl. The girl lives, the boy does not, and the mother perishes along with her son as a result of a difficult birthing. The chain of leadership is broken with their demise. Pai's father, an artist, can not come to grips with the deaths of his wife and son and so he leaves New Zealand, and Pai, who is cared for by her paternal grandparents.Years pass and Pai, at age twelve, has absorbed as much Maori knowledge as she is able from her grandfather Koro, (Rawiri Paratene), who is disapproving of his granddaughter's seemingly insatiable appetite to become a Maori leader. He has never quite forgiven her for being born a female, nor for living while her brother died. She exudes a true warrior's spirit and courage, which her grandfather refuses to see. Koro is desperately searching for a prophet - someone to lead his people &quot;out of the darkness and who will make everything all right again.&quot; When Koro starts a school for young boys, all first-born, to teach the old traditions, Pai is forbidden to attend. She desperately wants her grandfather's love and has some pretty tough abandonment issues to deal with - her father, who left her when she was an infant and her beloved grandfather who is emotional unavailable to her. I will not spoil the plot by revealing more. This film is must-see.The photography and landscapes, both underwater and above, are absolutely magnificent. The acting is marvelous and from the heart. Pai's and Koro's love-hate relationship, the tension between them, is nothing short of powerful. And I guarantee you will need a pack of Kleenex at the film's end.JANA",4,A Compelling And Inspirational FIlm!,1071878400,"12 20, 2003",2003,2929,"['Based', 'novel', 'Witi', 'Ihimaera', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'intelligent', 'independent', 'film', 'director', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'poignant', 'powerful', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'also', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'identity', 'old', 'ways', 'are', 'strong', 'mythical', 'components', 'film', 'underwater', 'shots', 'whales', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'sense', 'presence', 'commune', 'are', 'mystical', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'Maori', 'dance', 'narration', 'mythology', 'are', 'extraordinary.The', 'film', 'set', 'eastern', 'coast', 'New', 'Zealand', 'inhabited', 'ancient', 'people', 'Whangara', 'narrator', 'wonderfully', 'expressive', 'young', 'actress', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Paikea', 'called', 'Pai', 'twelve', 'year-old', 'Maori', 'girl', 'blood', 'royalty', 'veins', 'heart', 'warrior', 'chest', 'movie', 'Pai', 'narrating', 'Whangara', 'myth', 'Legend', 'native', 'people', 'came', 'New', 'Zealand', 'following', 'leader', 'Paikea', 'who', 'Pai', 'named', 'boy', 'who', 'heroically', 'rode', 'back', 'whale', 'Traditionally', 'tribal', 'leadership', 'always', 'gone', 'direct', 'descendants', 'first', 'leader', 'always', 'first', 'born', 'male', 'noble', 'line', 'Tragedy', 'however', 'when', 'fraternal', 'twins', 'are', 'born', 'line', 'boy', 'girl', 'girl', 'boy', 'not', 'mother', 'perishes', 'son', 'result', 'difficult', 'birthing', 'chain', 'leadership', 'broken', 'demise', 'Pai', 'father', 'artist', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'grips', 'deaths', 'wife', 'son', 'so', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Pai', 'who', 'cared', 'paternal', 'grandparents.Years', 'pass', 'Pai', 'age', 'twelve', 'absorbed', 'much', 'Maori', 'knowledge', 'able', 'grandfather', 'Koro', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'who', 'disapproving', 'granddaughter', 'seemingly', 'insatiable', 'appetite', 'become', 'Maori', 'leader', 'never', 'quite', 'forgiven', 'being', 'born', 'female', 'living', 'brother', 'died', 'true', 'warrior', 'spirit', 'courage', 'grandfather', 'see', 'Koro', 'desperately', 'searching', 'prophet', 'someone', 'lead', 'people', 'quot', 'darkness', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'everything', 'right', 'again.', 'quot', 'When', 'Koro', 'school', 'young', 'boys', 'first-born', 'teach', 'old', 'traditions', 'Pai', 'forbidden', 'attend', 'desperately', 'grandfather', 'love', 'pretty', 'tough', 'abandonment', 'issues', 'deal', 'father', 'who', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'infant', 'beloved', 'grandfather', 'who', 'emotional', 'unavailable', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'plot', 'revealing', 'more', 'film', 'must-see.The', 'photography', 'landscapes', 'underwater', 'above', 'are', 'absolutely', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'marvelous', 'heart', 'Pai', 'Koro', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'tension', 'nothing', 'short', 'powerful', 'guarantee', 'will', 'need', 'pack', 'Kleenex', 'film', 'end.JANA']",Whale Rider
774429,A1RMGC6CMJBNTU,B0000CABBW,Jason Koenig,"[3, 4]","First of all, Castle-Hughes is indeed the youngest Best Actress nominee (Tatum O'Neal won a Best Supporting Actress oscar), and it is well deserved.  Her performance is nothing short of mesmerizing.  Many reviewers here have said that her motivation in this film is to become the new tribe leader and her actions are all intended to prove to her grandfather that she is worthy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.Pai does not crave power or leadership.  She only wants what all children - what all people - want: love and acceptance.  The power in this film lies with the fact that Pai is humble and selfless, and this is what ultimately leads to her ascendance.  When she sings to the ancestors (the whales) to come to them, she is not doing it to prove she is the leader - she is doing it to help end her grandfather's suffering.  She doesn't care about herself - she just wants her grandfather to be happy.  She also cares about her tribe and its traditions - she is far more interested in Maori history than anyone else her age, perhaps more than anyone other than the tribal elders.  She loves her heritage and her grandfather, and when she sees an opportunity to make a difference she doesn't want to be left out.  She is not driven by a desire to lead.  She only wants to help and to belong, and in so doing she changes the lives of everyone around her.There are so many emotional moments in this film it is impossible to think through them all without getting choked up.  I knew very little about the film going into it and was really blown away by the masterful storytelling by these relatively new filmmakers.  Frankly, I'm surprised this film wasn't nominated for more than just the one nod to Keisha Castle-Hughes.  At the very least it deserved a nom for Adapted Screenplay (RETURN OF THE KING was the Best Film but as an adaptation it was lacking).  I think it deserved a Best Film nom ahead of SEABISCUIT, which I thought was fine but nowhere near as good as this.  Going by the oscars alone WHALE RIDER is certainly an extremely underrated film, and deserves to be seen.

I wanted to rewatch this- and it was even more moving the 2nd time around.Cinematography is wow.  The acting by all characters moving.  The writing, the storyline...I cried.  Niki Caro takes us through the emerging culture of the Maori, struggling to keep the old ways, as nearly every culture today does, yet in the midst of technological change, and the import of Western values.  And perhaps not all those values are bad... In no way is the culture of the Maori denigrated in this- rather the opposite, it is revealed in new ways to the outside world, as something valuable and worthy to be followed.  But it is also evolving, emerging, as is every culture, in every time.It is Keisha who makes this movie work most of all.  She is cute without being pretentious- she is honest and open in her acting, and so creates a character that desires goodness, and yet on terms of what is right for her soul, not necessarily what is dictated for her.  She is an Idealist NF dealing with an often absent Artisan SP father and a very strong Guardian SJ grandfather.  Her world is controlled by the Guardians, and she seeks to break free, and bring freedom, as an authentic Idealist.Benefits to the DVD:  Cut scenes were really great, especially the dinner scene, though I'm still trying to figure out why the scenes were cut.

The plot IS predictable and the message IS politically correct.  A little girl who is destined to be the new leader of her patriarchal tribe has to prove herself against the stubborn resistance and willful blindness of her grandfather, who is the current tribal chieftain.  Obviously, the film is not going to end with her being packed off to a nunnery.Now onto the real meat of this film - stupendous spirituality, near perfect story execution, hauntingly magical presentation, rich cultural content and of course, Keisha Castle-Hughes, who was apparently born to light up a movie screen with her eyes.If you are teaching world literature, I would honestly put this film in my top 20 of all time for that purpose.

Further, tomboys and sensitive guys will relate to the main character's tribulations over ""not acting right"" again based on rigid societal restrictions.

It doesn't cater to our lower nature at all ... quite rare in today's movie making ... but concentrates on family and tradition instead.It is the story of a Maori family living in a New Zealand village ... a family that had, for generations, provided the local Maori population with its spiritual leader ... always a male ... who, as tradition has it, is able to ride, yep, whales.  The youngest generation has no male to offer, only a young girl.  Strife naturally occurs, and the story is an unfolding of the initial resentment and then begrudged acceptance of this girl ... after it is demonstrated that destiny is on her side.Keisha Castle-Hughes plays the young girl, and she is excellent.  Rawiri Paratene plays her grumpy grandfather, and he is good too.  All the characters are true-to-life ... nothing is sugar coated ... and this is quite a departure from your normal cinematic fare.There is quite a bit of ... psychological violence ... coming out of the grandfather character.  He is quite mean to the girl ... all in the name of tradition ... and I didn't go for that at all.  She takes it like a little champion, however, and prevails in the end.It would have been a much better movie if the grandfather had had ... love in himself to give ... instead of the rigid (and senseless) demands of ancestry.  A nice balance (between his love for his grand-daughter and his concern for tradition) could have been maintained ... and this would have made the final victory all the more sweet.As it is, there are quite a few scenes that are unsettling ... not the least of which is the opening one.

The grandfather of the children has been waiting for the birth of a child to be the new chief of the tribe.  Two children are born: one male, one female.  The male child dies along with the mother.  The grandfather is disappointed and already starts on his son to find a new wife so that the son can have another male child.  The son rebels and runs away from his family.  The baby girl that the grandfather resented is left in his care.  We skip forward enough years to get us into the present and the baby girl has grown into a young girl (early teenage years, perhaps) named Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes).With the tribe needing a chief, and Pai not being a boy, Pai's grandfather decides to train the tribe's youth in the old ways, in the hopes that one of them will grow to be the next chief.  Pai is the closest to living the old ways as any of the children of the tribe, but the little problem of her being a girl keeps coming up.  She is forbidden to train with the boys, but practices on her own.  The movie is mostly the conflict between Pai and her grandfather and how she fits into the tribe.  We all know how this movie has to end, but there is little (or no) clich&eacute; in the journey Whale Rider takes us on.

774441,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B0000CABBW,Jon Norris,"[2, 2]","Whale Rider is an outstanding film. It is a well written, well acted film dealing with many issues, such as survival of a tribal culture in the ""modern"" world, generation gaps, gender gaps, and family members understanding and supporting each other. It also deals with leadership and the difficulties involved in trying to chart a course for a group of people for whom you are responsible.The central story of the film is the struggle of a young woman to gain acceptance from her grandfather. Wrapped around this is the story of tribal bloodlines and gender expectations. I can't really go into detail without spoiling the ending, but suffice it to say that Keisha Castle-Hughes did a great job as the courageous young woman, and all the actors gave very believable performances. I was drawn into the story easily, and it kept my attention through to the end.It is really nice to see more movies where women and girls are the heroes and get to show strong character development and great depth. Women have played very important roles in virtually every aspect of human history, and I feel cheated by the way they have been left out of historical tales.

774443,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0000CABBW,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 10]","WHALE RIDER comes from New Zealand, and opens with a Maori mother giving birth to twins, a son and a daughter. Unfortunately, the mother and son die in the delivery room. The father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), is left with only his infant daughter, Pai.A dozen years later, Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives in a Maori seashore community with her grandparents, Koro (Rawiri Paratene) and Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton). Koro is the tribal leader, the direct descendent of the original leader who, according to legend, came with his people from a faraway place on the backs of whales. Koro and hoped that his eldest son, Porourangi, would become chief, but the latter, after the death of his wife and son, left for Europe to become an artist. Koro is devastated by the loss of his male descendents. Though he loves Pai dearly, he consciously and deliberately excludes her from consideration as his successor. She is, after all, but a girl. So, Koro must select another heir apparent from the community after weeding out the teenage, male candidates. Pai is crushed; she loves her grandfather, and feels she must make up for the loss of her brother. Besides, she knows she's up to the job.I liked WHALE RIDER - up to a point. It incorporates so many of those social and personal struggles that make a good touchy-feely tear jerker: generation gap (Koro vs. Porourangi), gender bias (Koro vs. Pai), and coming-of-age (Pai vs. herself). Paratene as Koro is alternately likable and hateful as the amiable grandfather/stern traditionalist who doesn't have a clue. Haughton is a most pleasant surprise as Nanny Flowers, Pai's ally and Koro's chief critic. As Nanny puts it to her husband one night during a period of domestic tension, he may be the boss outside, but in their home she's in charge (and he'd better not forget it!). Castle-Hughes is winning as the plucky Pai.I won't award five stars because I left the screening feeling overtly manipulated. Whales have a significant part in this film, and indeed catalyze the outcome of Pai's struggle for recognition. And everybody is supposed think whales warm and cuddly, right? Also, the film's focus on a society so different from that of American audiences will perhaps arouse in the viewers a self-satisfying sense of politically correct, cultural sensitivity. I've had it up to here with the concept of political correctness. And the circumstances of Pai's triumph transcended plausible reality just a wee bit.Finally, I was left fidgety with the nagging feeling that the Maori teenage boys being tutored by Koro would have been better off learning, say, computer skills, rather than traditional chants or how to fight with big sticks.

I dropped lucky with this movie, I got it for a dollar would you believe!  Blockbusters was selling ex-rental copies to raise money for an appeal and I happened to be in the shop on that day, lucky or what?The plot is not complex, the Whangara people have long believed their presence in New Zealand dates a millennium, what is more they can trace their origins to a single ancestor who was lucky enough to escape death when his canoe capsized in the ocean and he rode to shore on the back of a whale.From that time on the Whangara chiefs, have been considered this man's direct descendants as their natural born tribal leader.Jump forward to the 21st century and we meet Pai played by the understated Keisha Castle-Hughes, an 11-year-old girl who comes to believe she is destined to be the new chief.However Pai's grouchy and somewhat bitter grandfather Koro, (Pai's male twin died at birth) played fantastically by Rawiri Paratene is bound by tradition to pick a male leader and he cannot see that Pai is in fact the next true leader of their tribe and it is his stubbornness and anger that just might lead to a terrible tragedy if he does not open his eyes before it is too late...This is one of the best films to come out of the 21st century; the scenery is breath taking, the acting first class and the sound-track spot on.  What more can you ask for?One of the most wonderful scenes for me is when Pai takes to the sea on the back of whale, at that moment she knows she cannot change her Grandfather's mind so she gives herself to nature and rides on the back of a whale, letting it take her down into the depth of an ancient ocean.A truly awesome film that that is worth watching over and over again just for that scene alone.",5,Coming of age in New Zealand,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,1820,"['classic', 'New', 'Zealand', 'film', 'amazing', 'performances', 'cast', 'dropped', 'lucky', 'movie', 'got', 'dollar', 'would', 'believe', 'Blockbusters', 'was', 'selling', 'ex-rental', 'copies', 'raise', 'money', 'appeal', 'happened', 'be', 'shop', 'day', 'lucky', 'what', 'plot', 'not', 'complex', 'Whangara', 'people', 'have', 'long', 'believed', 'presence', 'New', 'Zealand', 'millennium', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'trace', 'origins', 'single', 'ancestor', 'who', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'escape', 'death', 'when', 'canoe', 'capsized', 'ocean', 'rode', 'shore', 'back', 'whale.From', 'time', 'Whangara', 'chiefs', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'man', 'direct', 'descendants', 'natural', 'born', 'tribal', 'leader.Jump', 'forward', '21st', 'century', 'meet', 'Pai', 'played', 'understated', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', '11-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'believe', 'destined', 'be', 'new', 'chief.However', 'Pai', 'grouchy', 'somewhat', 'bitter', 'grandfather', 'Koro', 'Pai', 'male', 'twin', 'died', 'birth', 'played', 'fantastically', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'bound', 'tradition', 'pick', 'male', 'leader', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'Pai', 'fact', 'next', 'true', 'leader', 'tribe', 'stubbornness', 'anger', 'just', 'might', 'lead', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'not', 'open', 'eyes', 'too', 'late', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'come', '21st', 'century', 'scenery', 'breath', 'taking', 'acting', 'first', 'class', 'sound-track', 'spot', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'One', 'most', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'when', 'Pai', 'sea', 'back', 'whale', 'moment', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'Grandfather', 'mind', 'nature', 'rides', 'back', 'whale', 'letting', 'take', 'down', 'depth', 'ancient', 'ocean.A', 'truly', 'awesome', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'scene', 'alone']",Whale Rider

But leadership does not extend to girls in their tribe, and her grandfather tries to find the ""true chief"" among boys in the village by conducting lessons of strength and endurance.  Pai (played extremely effectively by first-time actress Keisha Castle-Hughes) is not allowed to join in these lessons, but her indomitable spirit is not crushed by her grandfather's rejection.  There are excellent supporting characters, such as Pai's grandmother, uncle, and often-absent father.  Each of these supporting characters help play a part in molding her character into a young woman with the leadership qualities her grandfather is looking for in others.This is a very well-made movie because it doesn't feel like a movie.  You are simply watching these colorful characters live their lives, exert their beliefs, and become one with their beautiful New Zealand surroundings.

774453,A36T2TEF5SKPUM,B0000CABBW,Laon,"[0, 0]","An unusual strength of this film is that though it's a film for adults it's also a movie to take children to.  They may not understand all of it, but they'll understand enough.  And you may discover things about those children, too, from their reaction to this film. But this film will move you, even if you don't have any children (even borrowed ones), to bring along.Don't let me put you off, if ""child-friendly movie"" sounds to you like something with a Robin-Williams-voiceover from the lowest pits of Hollywood hell.  I feel that way about most movies ""suitable for children"". But this is something else; an emotionally honest, intense, and (I'm sorry; I'm not much good at this) life-enhancing film.This is not a children's movie in any ordinary sense: there is absolutely no pandering, no cuteness, and no cheap manipulation.  Nobody hurts another person in a clever and amusing way and milks applause by putting up one fist triumphantly and saying, ""YESS!!""; and though the cast is not white, no-one looks at the camera and says, ""Well, shee-it!"", by way of comic relief; and no-one ... well, you get my drift.  In short, this film respects its cast, its story and its audience; it respects childhood and it respects age; and so it earns your respect.Here is a human story, about age and loss, youth and finding a way; and the preservation of an ancient way of life by allowing traditions to change and adapt.  In structure it's a fairy tale.  Koro, an elder of the Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti people, a Maori tribal group on the beautiful and isolated East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand, is concerned that younger leaders should be appearing.  But his own two sons have rejected that path; one to become an amiable dope-smoker with nothing in the way of ambition, the other to leave his home and people to make a career as an artist in Germany.His only mokopuna, or younger descendent, is his granddaughter Pai.  Pai shows over and again that she meets all the ancient tests of leadership, but Koro cannot see it, because she doesn't meet one of his criteria: she is a girl.The story is predictable, in its way, as any European tale about a younger son who becomes a clever tailor and marries the princess.  It's not Pai's eventual ascension to her rightful place that fascinates and involves, but the process; her own understanding that she has more to give than she knew, and that she has a duty to give it, and the slow realisation of those around her that she is someone special.  And the pain, on both sides, caused by her grandfather Koro's failure to see what he needs to see, the truth that stares him in the face.The pain the child and the old (not very old) man cause each other is intense, and sometimes unbearably moving to watch.  One scene where Pai makes a speech in honour of her grandfather Koro at a school cultural night, and realises that Koro refuses to come to listen to her, will certainly have you in tears, and the people around you. And yet this emotion comes naturally from the characters, who have earned your sympathy. There is no shallow Spielbergian audience-manipulation here.But Pai also hurts Koro.  The chief of Whangara-Mai-Tawhiti should have the power to call the whales, who have an ancient relationship with the Whangara people, whose ancestor Paikea rode to New Zealand on a whale.  And Koro is driven in despair to calling on the whales, only to have his despair deepen with the realisation that he cannot make the whales answer.  But when Pai calls, and the whales come, she only brings disaster; they beach themselves, and even with the efforts of the whole people to rescue them and return them to the sea, some of them die.  The arrival of the whales is a remarkable scene, involving computer imaging every bit as remarkable, but more subtle, as that in _Lord of the Rings_.The acting in this film is extraordinary; veteran actor Rawiri Paratane dominates the screen as Koro, a tough and uncompromising character who is very easy to hate.  But at the same time Paratene lets us know that Koro loves his granddaughter Pai, and that some of his toughness is because he believes it is in the interest of his people's future.  While 11-year old Keisha Castle-Hughes, as Pai, doesn't just dominate the screen; she lights it up.  Many superlatives have been directed at Castle-Hughes' performance, as a first-time actor.  She deserves all of them.  The rest of the cast are also superb, especially Cliff Curtis as Pai's father, who has abandoned much, though not all, of his Maori heritage, and Vicki Haughton as Pai's grandmother, Koro's wife, who heroically puts up with (mostly) Koro's stubborn blindness.  The other performances are also spot on, especially the non-actors. A highlight is the trio of older women, who make a splendidly rude joke about Pai's idealistic insistence that smoking is ""bad for their womanly properties"". The film is often very funny, sometimes quite earthy.Director Nicki Caro makes an impressive debut.  The score by Lisa Gerrard is another highlight.  I should also give credit to New Zealand, not only for its wild beauty, but for being a part of the world where indigenous people and newer arrivals have fought but also forged a way of living together, one that may be unique. There are things about the telling of this story, in the cooperation of the film crew and the people of Whangara, that have almost as much emotional resonance as the story on the screen.  New Zealanders have taken this film to their hearts because it says something about the people they are, and they're proud of that.  They're quite right to be.Cheers!Laon",5,Traditions survive by change:an emotional and beautiful film,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,5624,"['unusual', 'strength', 'film', 'film', 'adults', 'also',

774455,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000CABBW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 9]","One of the rarest things in movies is a kid who comes across as a real kid on screen.  The performance of Henry Thomas in &quot;E.T.&quot; had even more to do with that film's success that the animatronic alien and &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is graced by a similar performance by young Keisha Castle-Hughes.  But there is also a captivating story that challenges the audience rather than simply following convention.  No wonder this film kept winning audience awards from Toronto to Sundance.The story is of young Paikea Apirana, a Maori girl of New Zealand.  The day she was born both her mother and her twin brother died.  Her father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis) is the eldest son of the chief, Koro (Rawiri Paratene), who has been awaiting the birth of his grandson, convinced the boy will grow up to reunify the Maori and lead them into the future.  But Koro has no need for a granddaughter.  His son, who is an artist and not a leader, leaves New Zealand, his father, and his daughter behind, but not before one final act of defiance: he names his daughter Paikea, after the legendary ancestor of their people who rode the whale from Hawaiiki to this land.  Koro tells his wife (Vicky Haughton) to take the baby away, but she thrusts the baby into his arms, demanding he acknowledge his granddaughter, telling her husband, &quot;She likes you.&quot;The story continues a dozen years alter.  Pai's father returns for a brief visit to renew the ancient conflict with his father by bringing news of a pregnant girlfriend in Germany.  In a burst of anger Koro tells Porourangi to take Pai with him when he leaves because she is of no use to him.  Pai overhears this and while we would expect her to be devastated, she is not: she knows her grandfather's heart better than he does himself and even to be with her father she will not leave Koro and her community.  Without ever forcing the matter director Niki Caro, who also did the screenplay from Witi Ihimaera's novel, makes it clear that young Pai is the future of her people and wise beyond her years.At one point in the film Pai says recalls her family history and adds, &quot;But I was not the leader that my grandfather was expecting.&quot;  This is certainly true, but the great irony of this 2003 film is that Pai a leader beyond the old man's expectations.  She proves this not only in the wonderful climatic scene of &quot;Whale Rider,&quot; but during the most poignant and heartrending scene, when she gives a speech at a school concert that makes it clear that before she becomes a teenager she already knows exactly what her people need in terms of leadership for the future.  She also knows that she is keeping faith with her ancestors and her ancient namesake.It is clear from the start that &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is a very good film.  It has the tone, the characters, and the story line of one.  But where it becomes a great movie is where it sets up the pivotal moment in the film, the point at which Koro will recognize the truth about his granddaughter and acknowledge that she is the leader he has been awaiting.  All of the pieces are in place and I would not be surprised if many viewers already have tears running down their cheeks.  But instead of the providing the obvious, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; transcends the awaited moment and gives us something larger and more wonderful.  We should not have been surprised because the film had an earlier opportunity to bridge the gap between Koro and Pai, as she has been successfully completing on her own all of the tests her grandfather is giving to the young boys of the village in his search for a new leader, but her grandmother, in a moment of understated epiphany declares, &quot;No.  He is not ready yet.&quot;The obvious impulse is to call this a magical film, but that misses the mark for me on two scores.  &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is not only mystical instead of magical, it has a grounded sense of reality as well.  Both Pai and Koro speak of their family and their people as going back countless generations to the ancient ones.  How else do you explain a climax that transcends mere metaphor and visual beauty?  &quot;Whale Rider&quot; should not be considered a children's movie, because few children of Pai's age would be able to appreciate the depth of this exquisite film.",5,The enchanting and exquisite story of Paikea Apirana,1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,4307,"['One', 'rarest', 'things', 'movies', 'kid', 'who', 'across', 'real', 'kid', 'screen', 'performance', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'quot', 'E.T.', 'quot', 'had', 'even', 'more', 'do', 'film', 'success', 'animatronic', 'alien', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'graced', 'similar', 'performance', 'young', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'also', 'captivating', 'story', 'audience', 'rather', 'simply', 'following', 'convention', 'wonder', 'film', 'kept', 'winning', 'audience', 'awards', 'Toronto', 'Sundance.The', 'story', 'young', 'Paikea', 'Apirana', 'Maori', 'girl', 'New', 'Zealand', 'day', 'was', 'born', 'mother', 'twin', 'brother', 'died', 'father', 'Porourangi', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'eldest', 'son', 'chief', 'Koro', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'who', 'been', 'awaiting', 'birth', 'grandson', 'convinced', 'boy', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'reunify', 'Maori', 'lead', 'future', 'Koro', 'need', 'granddaughter', 'son', 'who', 'artist', 'not', 'leader', 'New', 'Zealand', 'father', 'daughter', 'not', 'one', 'final', 'act', 'defiance', 'daughter', 'Paikea', 'legendary', 'ancestor', 'people', 'who', 'rode', 'whale', 'Hawaiiki', 'land', 'Koro', 'wife', 'Vicky', 'Haughton', 'take', 'baby', 'away', 'baby', 'arms', 'demanding', 'acknowledge', 'granddaughter', 'telling', 'husband', 'quot', 'quot', 'story', 'dozen', 'years', 'alter', 'Pai', 'father', 'returns', 'brief', 'visit', 'renew', 'ancient', 'conflict', 'father', 'bringing', 'news', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'Germany', 'burst', 'anger', 'Koro', 'Porourangi', 'take', 'Pai', 'when', 'use', 'Pai', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'devastated', 'not', 'grandfather', 'heart', 'better', 'even', 'be', 'father', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'Koro', 'community', 'ever', 'forcing', 'matter', 'director', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'screenplay', 'Witi', 'Ihimaera', 'novel', 'clear', 'young', 'Pai', 'future', 'people', 'wise', 'years.At', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Pai', 'family', 'history', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'leader', 'grandfather', 'was', 'expecting.', 'quot', 'certainly', 'true', 'great', 'irony', '2003', 'film', 'Pai', 'leader', 'old', 'man', 'expectations', 'not', 'only', 'wonderful', 'climatic', 'scene', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'most', 'poignant', 'heartrending', 'scene', 'when', 'speech', 'school', 'concert', 'clear', 'teenager', 'already', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'need', 'terms', 'leadership', 'future', 'also', 'keeping', 'faith', 'ancestors', 'ancient', 'namesake.It', 'clear', 'start', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'tone', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'one', 'where', 'great', 'movie', 'where', 'up', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'film', 'point', 'Koro', 'will', 'recognize', 'truth', 'granddaughter', 'acknowledge', 'leader', 'been', 'awaiting', 'pieces', 'are', 'place', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'many', 'viewers', 'already', 'have', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'cheeks', 'instead', 'providing', 'obvious', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'awaited', 'moment', 'something', 'larger', 'more', 'wonderful', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'film', 'had', 'earlier', 'opportunity', 'bridge', 'gap', 'Koro', 'Pai', 'been', 'successfully', 'completing', 'own', 'tests', 'grandfather', 'giving', 'young', 'boys', 'village', 'search', 'new', 'leader', 'grandmother', 'moment', 'understated', 'epiphany', 'declares', 'quot', 'not', 'ready', 'yet.', 'quot', 'obvious', 'impulse', 'call', 'magical', 'film', 'mark', 'two', 'scores', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'mystical', 'instead', 'magical', 'grounded', 'sense', 'reality', 'as', 'well', 'Pai', 'Koro', 'speak', 'family', 'people', 'going', 'back', 'countless', 'generations', 'ancient', 'ones', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'explain', 'climax', 'mere', 'metaphor', 'visual', 'beauty', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'children', 'movie', 'few', 'children', 'Pai', 'age', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'depth', 'exquisite', 'film']",Whale Rider

Problem is, though, that the chief has to be a male, and this young lady is not, much to the grave disappointment of her paternal grandfather. Over time, the older man learns to love his granddaughter, but her femalehood is a bitter reminder of the endangered nature of their clan. He refuses to consider the girl as a possible chief in her own right, and begins to train all the boys nearby in the old traditions and rituals, looking for the next chief and protector of the the people. The young girl, however, is not to be outdone, and thereby hangs our Whale of a Tale.&quot;Whale Rider&quot; is a great entrant into the annals of the &quot;when old folks have to learn a lesson from young folks&quot; genre. The cast was unfamiliar to me, but every member gives a sterling performance and is utterly believable, whether as the young girl, the curmudgeonly grandfather, the more liberal-minded grandmother, or the goof-off uncle. The culture of these indigenous people is treated with reverence and respect, and the scenery Down Under is absolutely fabulous. The screenwriters do a creditable job, as well, in demonstrating that the grandfather's reaction to the girl is complicated: he has long ago learned to love her, but the concerns of his people and the lack of a male chief to take his place after him are causing him to reject her on many levels. Though we almost cry for her many times as the story goes on, we always know at the outset of such films that a happy ending will be pulled out somehow, and we are not disappointed in the end. &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is a great bildungsroman piece and I heartily recommend it to all takers.",5,Whale of a Tale,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,1855,"['are', 'told', 'outset', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'ancestors', 'came', 'land', 'back', 'whale', 'chiefs', 'people', 'are', 'therefore', 'descendants', 'first', 'early', 'whale', 'rider', 'Problem', 'though', 'chief', 'be', 'male', 'young', 'lady', 'not', 'much', 'grave', 'disappointment', 'paternal', 'grandfather', 'time', 'older', 'man', 'love', 'granddaughter', 'femalehood', 'bitter', 'reminder', 'endangered', 'nature', 'clan', 'consider', 'girl', 'possible', 'chief', 'own', 'right', 'train', 'boys', 'nearby', 'old', 'traditions', 'rituals', 'looking', 'next', 'chief', 'protector', 'people', 'young', 'girl', 'however', 'not', 'be', 'outdone', 'thereby', 'hangs', 'Whale', 'Tale.', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'great', 'entrant', 'annals', 'quot', 'when', 'old', 'folks', 'have', 'learn', 'lesson', 'young', 'folks', 'quot', 'genre', 'cast', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'member', 'sterling', 'performance', 'utterly', 'believable', 'young', 'girl', 'curmudgeonly', 'grandfather', 'more', 'liberal-minded', 'grandmother', 'goof-off', 'uncle', 'culture', 'indigenous', 'people', 'treated', 'reverence', 'respect', 'scenery', 'Down', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'screenwriters', 'do', 'creditable', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'demonstrating', 'grandfather', 'reaction', 'girl', 'complicated', 'long', 'ago', 'learned', 'love', 'concerns', 'people', 'lack', 'male', 'chief', 'take', 'place', 'are', 'causing', 'reject', 'many', 'levels', 'almost', 'cry', 'many', 'times', 'story', 'always', 'know', 'outset', 'such', 'films', 'happy', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'pulled', 'out', 'somehow', 'are', 'not', 'disappointed', 'end', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'great', 'bildungsroman', 'piece', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'takers']",Whale Rider

Reed ""roadrunner""","[0, 0]","I've shown this movie to one or more of my classes probably a dozen times and it's still enjoyable.The story is set among a group of Maori in present-day New Zealand. The two main characters are the chief of this group (""Paka"") and his troublesome 13-year old granddaughter (""Pai""). The grandfather loves Pai as a granddaughter but also blames her for ""the troubles,"" which he believes started the night she was born. (Her brother, who should have become the heir, died at birth, as did the mother; the father, Paka's eldest son, was so distraught that he fled New Zealand and established himself as an up-and-coming artist in Europe -- abandoning his people, in Paka's view.)From the beginning, Pai shows unusual talents and interest in ""the old ways,"" but Paka cannot see it because of his obsession with a male heir. At one point he gives up on his family and starts a school to find the potential heir among the first-born sons of the tribe -- with rather unpredictable results. If Amazon had a 6 star rating, I'd give this movie 6.The casting of this movie is brilliant. The conflict between Paka and Pai sizzles and the supporting characters (notably Paka's wife and Paka's two sons, the father and the uncle) are brilliant. Even the walk-on characters, like the other tribe members and the boys who attend the school are great.The scenery is fabulous and the story unfolds in a beautiful way. The movie is enjoyable on so many levels -- as good entertainment, as an inspiring story, as an interesting perspective on a different culture, or as a story on the generational conflict, families, and love.",5,"Beautiful story, fabulous acting",1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,1607,"[""'ve"", 'shown', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'classes', 'probably', 'dozen', 'times', 'still', 'enjoyable.The', 'story', 'set', 'group', 'Maori', 'present-day', 'New', 'Zealand', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'chief', 'group', 'Paka', 'troublesome', '13-year', 'old', 'granddaughter', 'Pai', 'grandfather', 'Pai', 'granddaughter', 'also', 'troubles', 'started', 'night', 'was', 'born', 'brother', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'become', 'heir', 'died', 'birth', 'did', 'mother', 'father', 'Paka', 'eldest', 'son', 'was', 'so', 'distraught', 'fled', 'New', 'Zealand', 'established', 'up-and-coming', 'artist', 'Europe', 'abandoning', 'people', 'Paka', 'view', 'beginning', 'Pai', 'unusual', 'talents', 'interest', 'old', 'ways', 'Paka', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'obsession', 'male', 'heir', 'one', 'point', 'up', 'family', 'school', 'find', 'potential', 'heir', 'first-born', 'sons', 'tribe', 'rather', 'unpredictable', 'results', 'Amazon', 'had', '6', 'star', 'rating', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', '6.The', 'casting', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'conflict', 'Paka', 'Pai', 'sizzles', 'supporting', 'characters', 'notably', 'Paka', 'wife', 'Paka', 'two', 'sons', 'father', 'uncle', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Even', 'walk-on', 'characters', 'other', 'tribe', 'members', 'boys', 'who', 'attend', 'school', 'are', 'great.The', 'scenery', 'fabulous', 'story', 'unfolds', 'beautiful', 'way', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'good', 'entertainment', 'inspiring', 'story', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'different', 'culture', 'story', 'generational', 'conflict', 'families', 'love']",Whale Rider
774464,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B0000CABBW,magellan,"[3, 6]","Having visited New Zealand several years back for a while and gone to the Maori Cultural Center at Lake Taupo and learned a little bit about Maori culture when I was there, I was curious to see how this movie would portray the Maoris and their culture.I wasn't disppointed, and the movie gives some fascinating glimpses into several aspects of Maori history and ways. The girls are shown being taught to perform the women's dances and how to sing in the Maori language, and the gruff and stern father is shown teaching the young boys how to be a chief, how to be a warrior and fight with a wooden staff, how to dance the war dance and make the frightening facial expressions that accompany the dances, and how to chant in the Maori tongue.But the story is really about the coming of age of the chief's daughter, who is destined to become the first woman chief. The father's ambition to find a suitable chief among the boys is frustrated since none really seem that motivated and capable. Worse still, his own son is pursuing a career as an artist in Europe and the father learns he's married a German girl rather than returning home to marry a Maori girl and settle in New Zealand.So the father's ambition to find a suitable chief to succeed him seems doomed to failure until one day his young daughter frees a beached whale and rides it out beyond the waves, after the chief and the rest of the tribe were unable to free the animal. According to legend, a whale rider from their tribe led the Maoris to New Zealand a thousand years ago, and another whale rider would appear again some day to lead them. The chief, who initially refuses to acknowledge his daughter's abilities and threatens to disown her when he discovers she's been learning the art of the staff and had bested one of the boys, is finally forced to realize at this point that the prophecy has been fulfilled and that it is his daughter who is destined to be their chief.The all-Maori cast does a great job with their roles, and all in all this movie is a fine tribute to Maori culture and traditions that provides some fascinating glimpses into this vanishing Pacfic Rim culture. Last but not least, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard recently and really adds to the overall ambience of the movie.",5,Interesting glimpse into Maori culture,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,2275,"['Having', 'visited', 'New', 'Zealand', 'several', 'years', 'back', 'while', 'gone', 'Maori', 'Cultural', 'Center', 'Lake', 'Taupo', 'learned', 'little', 'bit', 'Maori', 'culture', 'when', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'portray', 'Maoris', 'culture.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'disppointed', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'glimpses', 'several', 'aspects', 'Maori', 'history', 'ways', 'girls', 'are', 'shown', 'being', 'taught', 'perform', 'women', 'dances', 'how', 'sing', 'Maori', 'language', 'gruff', 'stern', 'father', 'shown', 'teaching', 'young', 'how', 'be', 'chief', 'how', 'be', 'warrior', 'fight', 'wooden', 'staff', 'how', 'dance', 'war', 'dance', 'make', 'frightening', 'facial', 'expressions', 'accompany', 'dances', 'how', 'chant', 'Maori', 'tongue.But', 'story', 'really', 'coming', 'age', 'chief', 'daughter', 'who', 'destined', 'become', 'first', 'woman', 'chief', 'father', 'ambition', 'find', 'suitable', 'chief', 'boys', 'frustrated', 'none', 'really', 'seem', 'motivated', 'capable', 'Worse', 'still', 'own', 'son', 'pursuing', 'career', 'artist', 'Europe', 'father', 'married', 'German', 'girl', 'rather', 'returning', 'home', 'marry', 'Maori', 'girl', 'settle', 'New', 'Zealand.So', 'father', 'ambition', 'find', 'suitable', 'chief', 'succeed', 'doomed', 'failure', 'one', 'day', 'young', 'daughter', 'beached', 'whale', 'rides', 'out', 'waves', 'chief', 'rest', 'tribe', 'were', 'unable', 'free', 'animal', 'According', 'legend', 'whale', 'rider', 'tribe', 'led', 'Maoris', 'New', 'Zealand', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago', 'whale', 'rider', 'would', 'appear', 'again', 'day', 'lead', 'chief', 'who', 'initially', 'acknowledge', 'daughter', 'abilities', 'disown', 'when', 'been', 'learning', 'art', 'staff', 'had', 'bested', 'one', 'boys', 'finally', 'forced', 'realize', 'point', 'prophecy', 'been', 'fulfilled', 'daughter', 'who', 'destined', 'be', 'chief.The', 'all-Maori', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'movie', 'fine', 'tribute', 'Maori', 'culture', 'traditions', 'fascinating', 'glimpses', 'vanishing', 'Pacfic', 'Rim', 'culture', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'recently', 'really', 'overall', 'ambience', 'movie']",Whale Rider

774467,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B0000CABBW,Mary Whipple,"[4, 4]","This film of a Maori chieftain's search for a successor who will keep the rural community's culture alive is also an appraisal of the culture itself and the values it represents.  The community is dying as its young people leave for the city and do not return, except briefly as visitors, and the chief, Koro (Rawiri Paratene) has no successor.  His own firstborn son, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), who would normally have succeeded him, has left the community after his wife died giving birth to twins--a son who died, and a daughter who lived.  Naming the surviving daughter (Keisha Castle-Hughes) Paikea, after the whale rider who formed the culture a thousand years ago, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis) abandons her to the care of her grandmother and the community and goes to Germany to promote his artwork.Paikea's difficult relationship with her grandfather, who scorns her because she is a girl and not the male heir he needs, is beautifully played here, and Keisha Castle-Hughes is a sensitive and winning actress who endows Paikea with the ""strength, courage, intelligence, and leadership"" which are the hallmarks of the culture.  Always trying to learn the old ways so that she can win her grandfather's love, she is, instead, constantly berated for trying to break the taboo of the marai by assuming a boy's role.The striking cinematography (Leon Narbey) captures the spirit of the land, while the underwater photography of whales, as Paikea's spirit is drawn to them throughout the film, is stunning.  Maori chants and ceremonial dances convey many of the Maori cultural traditions and illustrate their similarities with those of the Hawaiians, who share a common origin.  The exchange of breath between Maori as a greeting represents a sharing of each person's essence, a factor which achieves tremendous symbolic significance in a climactic moment at the end of the film.Because this is a film which conveys a message, it is not surprising that some of the characters here are two-dimensional, especially Koro, the grandfather, so consumed with the need to find a successor that he is unable to be a person.  But Paikea and the other children in the film more than make up for some of the adults' predictability with their palpable delight and pride in their culture and the fun they have learning the old ways.  A fascinating glimpse at a vanishing culture, this magnificent and moving film will itself help preserve its history and traditions.

774469,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0000CABBW,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","""Whale Rider"" is a remarkable and exquisite movie from New Zealand. Disregard the MPAA's clueless ""PG-13"" rating. This film is suitable for viewers aged ten to a hundred. And, for once, we have a movie which lifts one's spirits - indeed, makes them soar - without resorting to gross sentimentality, banal, manipulative dialog or predictable plot turns.This is the story of a young girl, Paikea [Keisha Castle-Hughes]. and her family, all of whom are part of the Maori population in New Zealand. The Maori were the original settlers of the island. They arrived many hundreds of years before the British, and in the remote part of the country where Paikea lives, they have retained much of their culture. One of their legends is that the original chief arrived in New Zealand on the back of a whale.Paikea is born in tragedy. Her mother dies in childbirth, and her twin brother is stillborn. Her grandfather, Koro [Rawiri Paratene], is a local Maori chief who begs the baby's father, Poro [Cliff Curtis], to start another family as soon as possible, but the heartbroken Poro decides to leave the country and pursue his ambitions as an artist. This leaves Koro and his wife, Flower [Vicky Haugton], to raise Paikea.The movie moves quickly forward to Paikea at age twelve. It is obvious that the girl and her grandfather have closely bonded. Their rift is simple: Koro can not accept the idea that a girl could ever be a Maori chief, but Paikea otherwise embodies everything that is Maori. She is almost literally the whale rider reborn.Castle-Hughes is the center of the movie, and she is, as other critics have noted, a star in the making. I have not seen a child carry a movie as well as she does since Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"". Hers is a stunning performance, and one can only hope that she can build from this role, as opposed to being defined by it.The photography is magnificent, as is the music score.

774471,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0000CABBW,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[4, 4]","In 2002, Niki Caro directed and co-wrote the screenplay for the endearing New Zealand film &quot;Whale Rider&quot;, which was based upon novel of the same name written by Witi Ihimaera and published in New Zealand in 1987.  (In Maori, the title is &quot;Te Kaieke Tohora&quot;.)  The story is about a young Maori girl named Paikea 'Pai' Apirana (Keisha Castle-Hughes), who is a direct descendent of the Maori chief Paikea who arrived at Whangara, New Zealand on the back of a whale many generations ago.  From that time forward, his first-born male descendents were each named after him and became chiefs; that is, until Paikea Apirana's parents gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, as their first-born children.  Sadly, the twin's mother died during childbirth, as did the boy; but the girl survived and was named Paikea.  Disgraced, her father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), leaves for Europe, so Pai's grandparents raise her instead.  Her grandfather, Koro Apirana (Rawiri Paratene), views Pai as a bad omen for the tribe and embarks on finding a Maori boy worthy of becoming the next chief since he can't accept the possibility of a girl becoming chief.  However, Pai's grandmother, Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton), loves Pai very much and encourages her to learn the ways of a chief in spite of Koro's objections.&quot;Whale Rider&quot; was first released at the Toronto Film Festival in September, 2002, where it won the &quot;People's Choice Award&quot;.  As it was shown at various independent film festivals that followed, including the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, it continued to win awards and was finally released for general cinema in May, 2003 in Australia and in the U.S. one month later.  Shortly thereafter, the Keisha Castle-Hughes received serious attention from film critics.  She was rewarded for her performance in &quot;Whale Rider&quot; with an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.  Though she did not win the Oscar, she will hopefully continue to develop her acting abilities and continue to be a superb member of her generation of actors and actresses.For its superb acting, wonderful story and incredible cinematography, I rate &quot;Whale Rider&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.

We all want to belong, to be like everyone else-hide from our roots, take on the identity of the majority, the whole.Niki Caro takes on the mantle of the Maori of New Zealand in the sad, melancholy, unrelentingly tragic yet ultimately positive ""Whale Rider.""Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is a young girl brought into Maori life with a couple of strikes against her: she is a female and she has survived the child bearing death of her mother and her twin, a brother who was destined to become a Chief. Her father leaves her with his parents and as she matures, she begins to develop the mystical, physical and leadership qualities of a Chief. But this is against nature says her grandfather, Koro and so begins the struggle between a grandfather and granddaughter; the struggle between the old ways and the new, the religious and the secular.The performances are very truthful and appealing especially Vicki Haughton as Pai's grandmother, Nancy Flowers whose expressive eyes hold not only a bottomless well of love and caring but a world weary realization of the world as it is and not as her husband, Koro wishes it to be. Castle-Hughes's Kai is a marvel: all jumbled up emotions, gangly legs yet steadfastly committed to what she feels is her right and destiny. Her scene in which she recites an essay written for her grandfather will be remembered as one of the most emotionally open and tragic scenes in recent memory.""Whale Rider"" is a view of a world to which we are not often privy.

The infant's father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis) names the girl Paikea after the first Maori of legend who came to New Zealand on the back of a whale, the name intended for her deceased brother. Unable to face his father's expectations and tribal life after the death of his wife and son, Porourangi leaves New Zealand to pursue a  career abroad and leaves his young daughter in the care of her grandparents, Koro (Rawiri Paratene), the tribe's Chief, and Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton). The precocious and fearless child, whom everyone calls Pai, wins the heart of her grandparents. But her grandfather still openly laments that Pai is not a boy who could inherit the responsibilities of chief, and he is anxious about his people's fate without a leader to guide them. When Pai  (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is 12 years old, she begins to think that she might be that leader, in spite of her gender. And her refusal to yield to the traditions which prohibit her from assuming a leadership role threaten to irreparably damage her relationship with her grandfather.""Whale Rider"" is inspired by the children's novel of the same name by Maori novelist Witi Ihimaera. It was adapted for the screen and expertly directed by New Zealander Niki Caro. This is a very lyrical film that is perfectly paced, so the audience never has a chance to get bored. The characters are all down-to-earth people who are nevertheless not simplistic, and each is sympathetic in his or her own way. The beautiful imagery of the New Zealand coast and the Maori traditions are a pleasure to watch. But the film deals with the universal themes of the traditional coming into conflict with the new and the younger generation with the old. The entire cast is excellent. And newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes is nothing short of astounding. Her portrayal of Pai is luminous and completely convincing. She pulls the audience into this story the minute she appears on screen. ""Whale Rider"" is an enchanting film which both children and adults will enjoy.The DVD: Bonus features include: theatrical trailers, tv spots, deleted scenes, a ""behind the scenes"" documentary, a documentary of the construction of a Maori war canoe for the film, 5 tracks from the film's score, and a photo gallery. I recommend both documentaries. One is a ""making of"" sort of thing, with interviews with the film's director and cast. The other is called ""Te Waka: Building the Canoe"" and explains how artists used both traditional and modern methods to construct a ceremonial Maori war canoe for the film in less than a month. The 5 complete tracks from the film's score are also a very nice bonus and may help you decide if you want to purchase the film's original score by composer Lisa Gerrard.",5,"Lyrical, Enchanting Film Blends Tradition and Modern Life",1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,2954,"['New', 'Zealand', 'coastal', 'community', 'long-awaited', 'arrival', 'Maori', 'tribe', 'next', 'leader', 'frustrated', 'when', 'male', 'grandchild', 'Maori', 'Chief', 'childbirth', 'mother', 'leaving', 'surviving', 'twin', 'sister', 'infant', 'father', 'Porourangi', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'girl', 'Paikea', 'first', 'Maori', 'legend', 'who', 'came', 'New', 'Zealand', 'back', 'whale', 'name', 'intended', 'deceased', 'brother', 'Unable', 'face', 'father', 'expectations', 'tribal', 'life', 'death', 'wife', 'son', 'Porourangi', 'New', 'Zealand', 'pursue', 'career', 'abroad', 'young', 'daughter', 'care', 'grandparents', 'Koro', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'tribe', 'Chief', 'Nanny', 'Flowers', 'Vicky', 'Haughton', 'precocious', 'fearless', 'child', 'whom', 'everyone', 'Pai', 'heart', 'grandparents', 'grandfather', 'still', 'openly', 'Pai', 'not', 'boy', 'who', 'could', 'inherit', 'responsibilities', 'chief', 'anxious', 'people', 'fate', 'leader', 'guide', 'When', 'Pai', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', '12', 'years', 'old', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'leader', 'spite', 'gender', 'refusal', 'yield', 'traditions', 'prohibit', 'assuming', 'leadership', 'role', 'threaten', 'irreparably', 'damage', 'relationship', 'grandfather', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'inspired', 'children', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Maori', 'novelist', 'Witi', 'Ihimaera', 'was', 'adapted', 'screen', 'expertly', 'directed', 'New', 'Zealander', 'Niki', 'Caro', 'very', 'lyrical', 'film', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'audience', 'never', 'chance', 'get', 'bored', 'characters', 'are', 'down-to-earth', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'not', 'simplistic', 'sympathetic', 'own', 'way', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'New', 'Zealand', 'coast', 'Maori', 'traditions', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'film', 'deals', 'universal', 'themes', 'traditional', 'coming', 'conflict', 'new', 'younger', 'generation', 'old', 'entire', 'cast', 'excellent', 'newcomer', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'nothing', 'short', 'astounding', 'portrayal', 'Pai', 'luminous', 'completely', 'convincing', 'audience', 'story', 'minute', 'screen', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'enchanting', 'film', 'children', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy.The', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'features', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'tv', 'spots', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'documentary', 'construction', 'Maori', 'war', 'canoe', 'film', '5', 'tracks', 'film', 'score', 'photo', 'gallery', 'recommend', 'documentaries', 'One', 'making', 'sort', 'thing', 'interviews', 'film', 'director', 'cast', 'other', 'called', 'Te', 'Waka', 'Building', 'Canoe', 'how', 'artists', 'used', 'traditional', 'modern', 'methods', 'construct', 'ceremonial', 'Maori', 'war', 'canoe', 'film', 'less', 'month', '5', 'complete', 'tracks', 'film', 'score', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'bonus', 'may', 'help', 'decide', 'want', 'purchase', 'film', 'original', 'score', 'composer', 'Lisa', 'Gerrard']",Whale Rider

774476,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B0000CABBW,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[6, 6]","Based on a book by Witi Ihimaera, the story is set in a small Maori community on the coast of New Zealand. Leadership of the town is passed down from from eldest son to eldest son, tracing all the way back to Paikea, their ancestor who rode to shore on a whale after capsizing in his canoe. This hereditary line is broken, however, when a girl is born to Porourangi Apirana, the eldest son of the current community leader. The girl's mother and twin brother die in childbirth, leaving Pai (her father names her after their heroic ancestor) the sole heir. Her grandfather, Koro, is disappointed, and though he loves his granddaughter very much, and she him, he shuns her and refuses to train her as the next leader. But Pai knows who she is and takes it upon herself to learn the ways of her people and fulfill her destiny.This is an amazing and touching story, made even better through excellent film-making. 12-year-old Pai is played by Keisha Castle-Hughes in a wonderful debut performance. One would never guess it was her first acting job. She manages to convey a great depth of emotion, and her crowning moment comes in a scene near the end, where she tearfully dedicates a speech to her beloved grandfather (Rawiri Paratene), who failed to show up for her recital of it. The whole film focuses on the conflicts between the great love the characters feel for each other, and the obligations of tradition. It is about a clash of generations and the struggle to reconcile the old world with the new. Pai's father (Cliff Curtis) is also at odds with Koro, so much so that he flees to live in Germany. And Pai's grandmother Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton) loves them all and tries her best to help then all make peace with one another.The movie is fairly short, clocking in at 101 minutes, but the slow pacing of the story makes it seem longer. There isn't really any action, yet somehow the viewer remains captivated by the story. The beautiful, haunting soundtrack also adds a great atmosphere to the film. Every main actor turned in a spectacular performance. If you aren't familiar with the New Zealand accent, however, it may take a little while to understand everything the actors say. The realism of it all is heightened by the fact that the movie was filmed in a real seaside Maori village, and all the &quot;extras&quot; are drawn from the town's own population. This lends a great sense of community, particularly in the emotional scene near the end where the people gather to aid a pod of beached whales (which, despite being replicas, look amazingly authentic). This scene ultimately leads to Pai, in an important symbolic role, riding on the back of one of the whales.The DVD also offers some nice extras. There is director commentary and the theatrical trailer. A great &quot;Behind the Scenes of Whale Rider&quot; featurette provides many insights into the filmmaking process, including how they selected Caste-Hughes for her role, how the whale replicas were constructed, and more. &quot;Te Waka: Building the Canoe&quot; follows the entire construction of the canoe that features as a major symbol in the film. Fittingly, the canoe was given as a gift to the people of the town in which the movie was filmed. There is also a featurette on the soundtrack, an art and photo gallery, and some deleted scenes. All in all I think this is one of the best films of 2003, and I recommend it highly. Though the main character is a 12-year-old girl, this is not a children's film, and should be enjoyable for viewers of all ages.",5,Great story of cultural biases &amp; the power of determination.,1079740800,"03 20, 2004",2004,3536,"['Based', 'book', 'Witi', 'Ihimaera', 'story', 'set', 'small', 'Maori', 'community', 'coast', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Leadership', 'town', 'passed', 'down', 'eldest', 'son', 'eldest', 'son', 'tracing', 'way', 'back', 'Paikea', 'ancestor', 'who', 'rode', 'shore', 'whale', 'capsizing', 'canoe', 'hereditary', 'line', 'broken', 'however', 'when', 'girl', 'born', 'Porourangi', 'Apirana', 'eldest', 'son', 'current', 'community', 'leader', 'girl', 'mother', 'twin', 'brother', 'die', 'childbirth', 'leaving', 'Pai', 'father', 'heroic', 'ancestor', 'sole', 'heir', 'grandfather', 'Koro', 'disappointed', 'granddaughter', 'very', 'much', 'train', 'next', 'leader', 'Pai', 'knows', 'who', 'learn', 'ways', 'people', 'fulfill', 'destiny.This', 'amazing', 'touching', 'story', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'excellent', 'film-making', '12-year-old', 'Pai', 'played', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'wonderful', 'debut', 'performance', 'One', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'was', 'first', 'acting', 'job', 'convey', 'great', 'depth', 'emotion', 'crowning', 'moment', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'tearfully', 'speech', 'beloved', 'grandfather', 'Rawiri', 'Paratene', 'who', 'failed', 'show', 'up', 'recital', 'whole', 'film', 'focuses', 'conflicts', 'great', 'love', 'characters', 'feel', 'other', 'obligations', 'tradition', 'clash', 'generations', 'struggle', 'reconcile', 'old', 'world', 'new', 'Pai', 'father', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'also', 'odds', 'Koro', 'so', 'much', 'live', 'Germany', 'Pai', 'grandmother', 'Nanny', 'Flowers', 'Vicky', 'Haughton', 'best', 'help', 'then', 'make', 'peace', 'one', 'another.The', 'movie', 'fairly', 'short', 'clocking', '101', 'minutes', 'slow', 'pacing', 'story', 'seem', 'longer', ""n't"", 'really', 'action', 'yet', 'somehow', 'viewer', 'captivated', 'story', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'main', 'actor', 'turned', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'New', 'Zealand', 'accent', 'however', 'may', 'take', 'little', 'understand', 'everything', 'actors', 'say', 'realism', 'heightened', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'real', 'seaside', 'Maori', 'village', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'drawn', 'town', 'own', 'population', 'great', 'sense', 'community', 'particularly', 'emotional', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'people', 'gather', 'aid', 'pod', 'beached', 'whales', 'being', 'replicas', 'look', 'amazingly', 'authentic', 'scene', 'ultimately', 'Pai', 'important', 'symbolic', 'role', 'riding', 'back', 'one', 'whales.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'nice', 'extras', 'director', 'commentary', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'A', 'great', 'quot', 'Scenes', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'quot', 'many', 'insights', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'including', 'how', 'selected', 'Caste-Hughes', 'role', 'how', 'whale', 'replicas', 'were', 'constructed', 'more', 'quot', 'Te', 'Waka', 'Building', 'Canoe', 'quot', 'entire', 'construction', 'canoe', 'major', 'symbol', 'film', 'Fittingly', 'canoe', 'was', 'given', 'gift', 'people', 'town', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'also', 'featurette', 'soundtrack', 'art', 'photo', 'gallery', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2003', 'recommend', 'highly', 'main', 'character', '12-year-old', 'girl', 'not', 'children', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'viewers', 'ages']",Whale Rider

I had heard about it and that it was an art-house favorite, one can't begin to see why, it is really amateurish and doesn't tell anything new which hasn't been done in some extent by American films and most of the script is extremely weak and simplistic.Most everyone has been saying that this is so ""original"" but if you look at the history of American film, you can find many things which were borrowed. The film itself is unbelievable, and incredulous considering the lead role is played by a white little girl who doesn't really emphasize enough about the Maori culture, all she does is mop around in her sad state because her grandfather doesn't respect her because she is a girl. Not only is this film an aberration, but it insults all previous Maori culture because it pretends to be an modern artifact which wants to unite the past and the new, thing is, erasing the old ways isn't the way to do it.Males and females had distinct roles in early cultures and there was nothing wrong with that, that is how they survived until the modern world caught up with them and started removing pieces of their structure and eventually, they became integrated into the European world, which was quite a mistake, considering that is where Feminist theory had surfaced its ugly head. Most of the cast is played by annoying people who can't act, one example is the little stoner boy who is being trained in the martial arts by the grandfather, he doesn't even look like he should be there, he fights the little girl with sticks and it is the most contrived scene I have ever seen. Most of the film, if not all, is contrived in such ways. Because it is so simplistic and absurd, this film will move many simple minded dullards who can't see beyond it's pretensions, this film is evil in its most evident nature because it wants to be 'feminist' and contort the meaning of the past, so much like totalitarian states. I should warn everyone that most of it is very boring also and the ending is one of the most ludicrous things I have ever seen.

However, when the first born son dies during birth and his twin sister, Pai, survives, it creates much tension in the tribe since females are not allowed to be chief under any circumstances.  She is constantly shunned as an outcast by her grandfather and most of the tribe.  Her grandfather attempts to train their indigenous ways to the other boys while Pai secretly watches from afar.  With minimal help from her uncle and from watching the other boys, she learns all of the traditions and performs better than any of the boys trained by her grandfather.  With the final test, retrieving the whale tooth, the boys each came up empty handed.  While out on the ocean later with her uncle she asks about the tooth and then immediately dives deep to the bottom and finds it much to the dismay of the others.  Her grandmother keeps it from her grandfather knowing it would hurt him further and he would never accept it.  After her performance one evening, they find the beach covered in whales refusing to return to the sea.  Their efforts are useless and Pai, watching from afar, knows why.  As the rest of her people begin to leave, she confronts the largest whale and magically returns it, as well as all the others, to the ocean while riding on its back.  It is at this point her grandfather finally accepts her special powers and abilities to lead their tribe.Additionally, this movie reflects many aspects of indigenous people and their religions.  The tribe is a very close knit community, typical of many indigenous ways.  Pai's beautiful chanting in the Maori language is magical itself along with her emotional storytelling of her family's past.  While Pai's grandfather is unable to get the spirits to listen to him and guide him, they do listen to Pai and help guide her through this journey.  Pai acts as a shaman with her abilities to return the whales to the ocean.  Other examples are the grandfather teaching the other boys a sacred dance and how to fight with the sticks like a warrior, and his token of a whale.  The many references to the whales guiding the family are made even with them preventing Pai from moving to Germany with her father.  The clash between the tribe's indigenous ways and modern influences are also apparent especially with Pai's father moving away to pursue his artistic talents, thus, leaving his parents to raise her.",5,A beautiful and magical movie,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2482,"['story', 'Maori', 'tribe', 'struggles', 'carry', 'traditions', 'have', 'past', 'thousand', 'years', 'However', 'when', 'first', 'born', 'son', 'dies', 'birth', 'twin', 'sister', 'Pai', 'much', 'tension', 'tribe', 'females', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'be', 'chief', 'circumstances', 'constantly', 'shunned', 'outcast', 'grandfather', 'most', 'tribe', 'grandfather', 'attempts', 'train', 'indigenous', 'ways', 'other', 'boys', 'Pai', 'secretly', 'afar', 'minimal', 'help', 'uncle', 'watching', 'other', 'boys', 'traditions', 'performs', 'better', 'boys', 'trained', 'grandfather', 'final', 'test', 'retrieving', 'whale', 'tooth', 'boys', 'came', 'up', 'empty', 'handed', 'out', 'ocean', 'later', 'uncle', 'tooth', 'then', 'immediately', 'deep', 'bottom', 'much', 'dismay', 'others', 'grandmother', 'keeps', 'grandfather', 'knowing', 'would', 'hurt', 'further', 'would', 'never', 'accept', 'performance', 'one', 'evening', 'find', 'beach', 'covered', 'whales', 'refusing', 'return', 'sea', 'efforts', 'are', 'useless', 'Pai', 'watching', 'afar', 'why', 'rest', 'people', 'begin', 'leave', 'largest', 'whale', 'magically', 'returns', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'ocean', 'riding', 'back', 'point', 'grandfather', 'finally', 'special', 'powers', 'abilities', 'lead', 'tribe.Additionally', 'movie', 'many', 'aspects', 'indigenous', 'people', 'religions', 'tribe', 'very', 'close', 'knit', 'community', 'typical', 'many', 'indigenous', 'ways', 'Pai', 'beautiful', 'chanting', 'Maori', 'language', 'magical', 'along', 'emotional', 'storytelling', 'family', 'past', 'Pai', 'grandfather', 'unable', 'get', 'spirits', 'listen', 'guide', 'do', 'listen', 'Pai', 'help', 'guide', 'journey', 'Pai', 'shaman', 'abilities', 'return', 'whales', 'ocean', 'Other', 'examples', 'are', 'grandfather', 'teaching', 'other', 'sacred', 'dance', 'how', 'fight', 'sticks', 'warrior', 'token', 'whale', 'many', 'references', 'whales', 'guiding', 'family', 'are', 'made', 'even', 'preventing', 'Pai', 'moving', 'Germany', 'father', 'clash', 'tribe', 'indigenous', 'ways', 'modern', 'influences', 'are', 'also', 'apparent', 'especially', 'Pai', 'father', 'moving', 'away', 'pursue', 'artistic', 'talents', 'thus', 'leaving', 'parents', 'raise']",Whale Rider

Here is Pai, a small 12 year old girl, always trying to please her Grandfather.  Yet she knows the story of her tribe.  Her mother was to give birth to the next chief in the family.  Instead, they got her.  This story transcends the Maori culture, for every child strives to be accepted by their parents.  Be it the first born, who has to live up to the parents expectations.  The middle child, overshadowed by an older sibling.  Or the youngest child, often overlooked for anything great.  Pai, though often rejected, stayed strong to her intuition that she could be great.

774489,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000CABBW,Robert Moore,"[7, 7]","This is a thoroughly satisfying but very, very unusual movie.  Set in Auckland, New Zealand, in the present among members of a Maori tribe struggling to find a new leader, the movie is primarily about acceptance and rejection, and the difficulty of meeting expectations.  The central character is an eleven-year-old girl, Pai, marvelously portrayed by newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Life starts off badly for her, with her mother dying in childbirth giving birth to Pai and her twin brother, who is stillborn.  Her father more or less deserts her, partly because of the pain of losing his wife and son, but partly because of the strained relations with his father Koro, who was convinced that the infant boy would become the new leader of their tribe.Pai wants to take a place of leadership within her tribe, but is prevented by her rigidly traditional grandfather.  Although smart and respectful of her ancestors and the traditional ways and beliefs, she is denied any potential role because of her gender.  The film focuses both on her attempt to fulfill the role she feels calling out to her, and her attempt to win the affection and acceptance of her grandfather, whom she loves despite his hostility.This is a beautiful film, and the climax is as satisfying as one could hope.  One must allow oneself to become a bit of a believer in things mystical and magical, else the film won't work at crucial moments.The film is populated with complete unknowns, except for Cliff Curtis, who plays Pai's father.  He has appeared in a large number of big budget Hollywood films, frequently as heavies, including THREE KINGS, COLLATERAL DAMAGE, and TRAINING DAY.  Just about everyone does an excellent job, though Keisha Castle-Hughes and Rawiri Paratene as Koro stand out.Although many of the houses are inexpensive looking and even in some instances mildly dilapidated, nothing can disguise the extreme physical beauty of the locale.  With a large bay and sandy beach facing the ocean, and striking, magnificent mountains ascending behind the houses, the location is strikingly beautiful.This is not always an easy film to watch.  Some of the scenes in which various individuals are expressing their feelings can be very hard to take, and Rawiri Paratene can express anger that is extremely realistic.  Nonetheless, this film as a whole is one that deals with the possibility of healing, of acceptance, and of learning to expand the boundaries of one's conception of the world.

But because Pai was born a girl her grandfather prohibits her from learning the cultural traditions. Pai is then forced to sit on the sidelines while other first-born boys are taught the ancient ways of their ancestors. Her stern and strict grandfather often reprimands her and she is determined to prove herself worthy of the post of the new chef.Although there are obvious similarities between these two films, WHALE RIDER contains a more richly textured and nuanced plot. The most compelling part of the story is the anthropological plotline whereby a culture must face its own mortality in a modern world. When old customs and traditions have lost their meaning for every day life, why keep them going?

Whale Rider could of easily fell into a politically correct trap -- with the Maori tribal traditions as partrichal as the Catholic Church, and, when frozen in the past, as close-minded.  But the movie's approach is understated.  It is also gentle and wise, suggesting that tradition does have a great deal to teach, but it is best understood when past, present, and future are equally considered when searching for wisdom. In other words, by maintaining a healthy tension between the three, only then can we hear the quiet voice that seeks to guide us, whether it be through whales, the Ancients, or God.There is a point in the movie when I felt a powerful, but tragic, ending could of been chosen. (You will know it when you see it.) And what follows that moment is to some extent a feel good ending (leaving me with a few questions as to How?). But that, in this case, is nitpicking.

It has an energy to it that is infectious and a story that is as unconventional as it is novel.  It also showcases the most heartfelt and authentic performance by a young actress in quite some time.A young Maori girl named Pai Apirana (Keisha Castle-Hughes) survives a birth that claims the lives of her mother and her twin baby brother.  Her birth creates a problem because her father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis) was next in line to be the chief of his people.  However, he has no interest in assuming the mantle of leadership and leaves for Europe to pursue his art career.  Faced with no male heir, Pai's grandfather Koro (Rawiri Paratene) - the current chief - ignores talk that Pai could be the next chief and begins to look outside the family for his successor.  Supported by her grandmother, Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton), Pai nonetheless refuses to give up on her quest to succeed her grandfather.""Whale Rider"" is no spectacle of a film.  It is a small-scale depiction of the lives of real people who experience their fair share of hardships and triumphs.  On this level, the film is a charming and enjoyable production.  The acting is top-notch across the board and the New Zealand backdrop is breathtaking, but it is Castle-Hughes who is most responsible for making the film work.  She has a magnetic aura about her that she projects effortlessly from the first frame she appears in.  So appealing is Castle-Hughes as an actress that you are glad that you accompanied her character on her cinematic journey.

Without getting into the plot and all that has already been written, understand that Whale Rider is a deep, powerful story (I'd say for ages 12 and up) and is NOT a ""kid's movie""; it just happens to center around a child.  Whale Rider is about familial relationships, trust, respect and honor.  As composer Lisa Gerrard put so well, ""A sometimes dark but self effacing world of young Pai's (the main character) beautiful and difficult relationship with her grandfather that is heart rendingly defined by her awareness of her own identity, the depth of which we so often underestimate in our own children.""The cinematography is incredible... beautifully shot, and CGI-free.  Lisa Gerrard's score is not just an added layer or an underscore, but it becomes an integral part of the movie's power.Take a journey into this magical adventure you'll never forget.

This movie to me is more about being ""called"" than simply ""girls can do everything boys can do!"" Pai has been ""called"" to the role of leader, you can see it in her being really-and it simply takes time for her Grandfather to see it. I think Koro's actions in many ways are understandable-he is watching his people drown in poverty and the effects of colonization. It is THROUGH tradition and heritage that he sees a solution for his people's demise. And at the end when he says to Pai, ""forgive me, I am just a fledgling, new to flight,'"" it is then that we fully understand that Koro recognizes that calling too. Also, I have a Maori cousin who gave me a good insight regarding the part where Pai is nuzzling the whale-in Maori culture, when you pass breath through the nose as a greeting, you are in effect symbolically inferring that you would give your life-in the form of the breath-for that person. So, when Pai does exchange her breath the whale, she is ineffect saying she would exchange her life for that whale. Thus the whole part where she says she wasn't afraid to die-because basically she had already made that commitment earlier with the ritualistic breath exchange. AWESOME MOVIE-all kids should see this movie, as well as adults!

774506,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B0000CABBW,Traveler,"[23, 25]","When you go to the video store looking for films with positive role models for kids (and adults!), with an inspirational message that you can accomplish something if you put your mind to it, you typically will find almost nothing.  Worse, even movies with a fraction of a positive message will be so silly or idiotic that watching them as an adult is torture.  With ""Whale Rider"" you get a movie that adults and teens (and many pre-teens) can both watch and enjoy.As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review of ""Whale Rider,"" something is horribly wrong with a ratings system that gives a movie like this a PG-13 rating.  Just watch this next to a movie like ""Dodgeball"" with its objectification of women, toilet humor and sexual innuendo.  Both movies have the same rating!  Don't be fooled.  The average 12 year old _should_ be watching ""Whale Rider"" while ""Dodgeball"" shouldn't be viewed even by 14 year olds.  All of this has me wondering about about the sanity and intelligence of the ratings board.As many have pointed out, Keisha Castle-Hughes puts in a superb performance.  Ditto for the rest of the cast.Perhaps even better than the performances are the positive roles played by most characters.  The kids are intelligent, confident and curious.  The adults are generally supportive and wise.  While the males in the movie have obvious faults, this movie is about them as it is about ""girl power.""  There's a scene where Keisha's character is riding a bike with her grandfather and a loving glance passes between them.  How rare it is to see such imagery - a father figure bonding with a child - in movies or TV!  ""Whale Rider"" isn't just about celebrating a girl's empowerment.  It's also about showing the love between male parental figures and their own personal growth as their children mature.One caveat: ""Whale Rider"" is not typical Hollywood popcorn fare.  Viewers with short attention spans or those who hate all foreign film style films will likely not like this movie.  Still, ""Whale Rider"" is an excellent start to open the eyes of a youth (or an adult) to ideas outside of what the studies usually throw at us.Bottom line: We'd all be better off if we had more movies like this.",5,We'd all be better off if we had more movies like this,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,2196,"['When', 'go', 'video', 'store', 'looking', 'films', 'positive', 'role', 'models', 'kids', 'adults', 'inspirational', 'message', 'can', 'accomplish', 'something', 'put', 'mind', 'typically', 'will', 'find', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Worse', 'even', 'movies', 'fraction', 'positive', 'message', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'silly', 'idiotic', 'watching', 'adult', 'torture', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'get', 'movie', 'adults', 'teens', 'many', 'pre-teens', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy.As', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'pointed', 'out', 'review', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'something', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'ratings', 'system', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Just', 'watch', 'next', 'movie', 'Dodgeball', 'objectification', 'women', 'toilet', 'humor', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'rating', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'average', '12', 'year', 'old', '_should_', 'be', 'watching', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'Dodgeball', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'viewed', 'even', '14', 'year', 'olds', 'wondering', 'sanity', 'intelligence', 'ratings', 'board.As', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Keisha', 'Castle-Hughes', 'superb', 'performance', 'Ditto', 'rest', 'cast.Perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'performances', 'are', 'positive', 'roles', 'played', 'most', 'characters', 'kids', 'are', 'intelligent', 'confident', 'curious', 'adults', 'are', 'generally', 'supportive', 'wise', 'males', 'movie', 'have', 'obvious', 'faults', 'movie', 'about', 'girl', 'power', 'scene', 'where', 'Keisha', 'character', 'riding', 'bike', 'grandfather', 'loving', 'glance', 'passes', 'How', 'rare', 'see', 'such', 'imagery', 'father', 'figure', 'bonding', 'child', 'movies', 'TV', 'Whale', 'Rider', ""n't"", 'just', 'celebrating', 'girl', 'empowerment', 'also', 'showing', 'love', 'male', 'parental', 'figures', 'own', 'personal', 'growth', 'children', 'mature.One', 'caveat', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'popcorn', 'fare', 'Viewers', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'who', 'hate', 'foreign', 'film', 'style', 'films', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'movie', 'Still', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'excellent', 'start', 'open', 'eyes', 'youth', 'adult', 'ideas', 'what', 'studies', 'usually', 'throw', 'us.Bottom', 'line', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'movies']",Whale Rider
774507,A1K2ACRU9YJS17,B0000CABBW,"Tsila Sofer Elguez ""Tsila Sofer Elguez""","[4, 5]","This film is wholly dedicated to the Maori people, serving as a tribute to their culture and combining myth, folklore and the current status of its people; also the (fruitless?) effort to preserve the Maori culture for the future. I finally understood the &quot;sticking of the tongue&quot; act of war, and not only that. I think that on a broader scale the film deals with what seems to be the main problem of the Maori, the conflict of the past and modern times and the next generation trying to find its place in the world.However, first and foremost the film deals with the issue of the successor. Who is a true successor? Is it destiny that decides or can one prove himself fitting? According to tradition the male son born to the Maori leader will continue its ways. The girl, Pai, although fitting by nature cannot take its place until she proves herself right through hardships and pain and the aid of some supernatural forces. I was bothered by the fact that in this film there is the same problem as other movies or stories dealing with a &quot;different&quot; child (slow, handicapped, etc.) which cannot be accepted by society until he does something extraordinary - saves the day in some way.Only after an act of great courage and sacrifice does the different child (or girl in this story) can be accepted for what she is. Here the &quot;accepting&quot; needs to be done by  Kuru, the grandfather as she is only a girl and he is fighting so hard to preserve the culture. Contrary to other viewers, I do not think that Pai was totally rejected by her grandfather. It seems that he has been spoiling her for years (the bicycle scene) and thus has given her a very confident nature. At a certain phase (after his eldest son leaves) he seems to reach a decision to harden his heart and &quot;do the right thing&quot; according to his belief (train a male heir). At least this is the way I understood the movie and I felt it does a good job in delivering Kuru's torn heart.Several problems are briefly hinted about but not really dealt with: Rawiri, the second son grows fat and lazy over the years. Movie shows that his life style includes lots of drinking and billiard playing. His mother explanation to his deterioration is the fact that he is the second son. Is this enough? On the other hand his father says to him on another occasion: &quot;The people will do this for you&quot; hinting that Rawiri does have leadership qualities. This is not further investigated and Rawiri (contrary to Pai) does not fight for his place. Another issue is one of the first sons (Heime?) that seems to be &quot;marked&quot; by Kuru as his successor however is rejected at a certain stage (before the necklace picking test) why? I did not understand (is it his father? The fact that he liked Pai?. Another issue is the husband-wife relation: &quot;I have my ways over him&quot; says the strong opinionated grandmother but this too is not fully materialized.All in all a very interesting film to watch with landscapes and tastes of a faraway place.",4,A tribute to the Maori people combining myth and folklore,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,3043,"['film', 'wholly', 'dedicated', 'Maori', 'people', 'serving', 'tribute', 'culture', 'combining', 'myth', 'folklore', 'current', 'status', 'people', 'also', 'fruitless', 'effort', 'preserve', 'Maori', 'culture', 'future', 'finally', 'understood', 'quot', 'sticking', 'tongue', 'quot', 'act', 'war', 'not', 'only', 'think', 'broader', 'scale', 'film', 'deals', 'what', 'be', 'main', 'problem', 'Maori', 'conflict', 'past', 'modern', 'times', 'next', 'generation', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'world.However', 'first', 'foremost', 'film', 'deals', 'issue', 'successor', 'Who', 'true', 'successor', 'decides', 'can', 'one', 'prove', 'fitting', 'According', 'tradition', 'male', 'son', 'born', 'Maori', 'leader', 'will', 'continue', 'ways', 'girl', 'Pai', 'fitting', 'nature', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'right', 'hardships', 'pain', 'aid', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'was', 'bothered', 'fact', 'film', 'same', 'problem', 'other', 'movies', 'stories', 'dealing', 'quot', 'different', 'quot', 'child', 'slow', 'handicapped', 'etc', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accepted', 'society', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'day', 'way.Only', 'act', 'great', 'courage', 'sacrifice', 'different', 'child', 'girl', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'accepted', 'what', 'Here', 'quot', 'accepting', 'quot', 'be', 'done', 'Kuru', 'grandfather', 'only', 'girl', 'fighting', 'so', 'hard', 'preserve', 'culture', 'Contrary', 'other', 'viewers', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Pai', 'was', 'totally', 'rejected', 'grandfather', 'been', 'spoiling', 'years', 'bicycle', 'scene', 'thus', 'given', 'very', 'confident', 'nature', 'certain', 'phase', 'eldest', 'son', 'reach', 'decision', 'harden', 'heart', 'quot', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'quot', 'according', 'belief', 'train', 'male', 'heir', 'least', 'way', 'understood', 'movie', 'felt', 'good', 'job', 'delivering', 'Kuru', 'torn', 'heart.Several', 'problems', 'are', 'briefly', 'hinted', 'not', 'really', 'dealt', 'Rawiri', 'second', 'son', 'fat', 'lazy', 'years', 'Movie', 'life', 'style', 'lots', 'drinking', 'billiard', 'playing', 'mother', 'explanation', 'deterioration', 'fact', 'second', 'son', 'enough', 'other', 'hand', 'father', 'occasion', 'quot', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'quot', 'hinting', 'Rawiri', 'have', 'leadership', 'qualities', 'not', 'further', 'investigated', 'Rawiri', 'contrary', 'Pai', 'not', 'fight', 'place', 'issue', 'one', 'first', 'sons', 'Heime', 'be', 'quot', 'marked', 'quot', 'Kuru', 'successor', 'however', 'rejected', 'certain', 'stage', 'necklace', 'picking', 'test', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'father', 'fact', 'liked', 'Pai', 'issue', 'husband-wife', 'relation', 'quot', 'have', 'ways', 'quot', 'strong', 'opinionated', 'grandmother', 'too', 'not', 'fully', 'materialized.All', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'watch', 'landscapes', 'tastes', 'faraway', 'place']",Whale Rider
774508,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000CABBW,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","11 year-old newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes literally shines in this endearing and moving tale about a Maori girl Pai, whose belief conquers every obstacle before her.  You don't have to know the original book; you just have to see the radiating charm of Keisha as Pai.When Pai was born, her twin brother was dead.  Though this misfortune didn't alienate the chief of the family Koro from his granddaughter, it is painfully obvious that he wanted a boy, not a girl.  Among the male-donimating tradition, Koro still seeks for the one to inherit the tradition of the people among the local boys, and starts to teach it in school.But it is Pai, now grown up a lovely girl, who thinks that she is Paikea, the decendent of the Whale Rider who arrived there from the sea a long time ago.  Her zeal, however, unwittingly causes the wrath of her grandfather, who would not admit any female succeeding the name.  But Pai knows that she is right, and we too.The simplicity of the story does not damage the film; it rather enhances it to the level of myth, and with the director's skillful descriptions of the Maori society where not everybody is happy to live, the film is given a colorful characters and some of the amusingly wry humor.But it is Keisha Castle-Hughes who will impress you with her charms.  She is sweet, she is amiable, and most of all she is natural.  Castle-Hughes, who is 'discovered' by the same agent who found Anna Paquin, is a good testimony that you don't have to attend the acting school to be a star.There are also great performance from Rawari Paratene as Koro, whose character might at first be looked at in the negative light.  He succeeds in raising his portrait of the grandfather to tragedy, and we are not angry with, but sorry for him.Pai's speech given at the latter half of the film is one of the greatest moments in the movie history, easily matching the Auden quotations by John Hannah in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""  Her sincere words would never fail to move you, and that part alone is worth the time of your life.

774509,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B0000CABBW,Wesley Mullins,"[2, 6]","We live in an age where moving stories of courage and determination just aren't enough. Those tales have to be accompanied by Oprah Book Club moments of overcoming handicaps and tragedy or dealing with racism and sexism. Many a great story is ruined because the real drama of life takes a secondary role to the politically correct lens through which it is told.In Whale Rider, it is the Lifetime-esque melodramatic subplot dealing with the evil old men who run the world and try to prevent little girls from reaching their life's destiny. The story takes place inside an aboriginal whaling community, seemingly untouched by the modern cultural advancements of the past one hundred years. Of course, our liberal filmmakers decided these people needed to be lectured in gender roles, and thus the little story of a young girl over-coming an oppressive and chauvinistic world is born.Now, that all sounds like criticism for this film, and I do admit I wish this Steinam-like depiction of men was toned down a bit. But that one flaw doesn't change the fact that this is a wonderful film, a truly remarkable achievement. Forgetting all the male-bashing, at the center of the film is a touching story about a young child who so wants to be loved, especially by her grandfather. She latches on to a story from family's her past about a great voyager who arrived at their island on the back of a whale, a great warrior whose soul will someday return in a &quot;chosen one&quot;. The young girl decides she has as much claim to the birthright as any of the boys and attempts to prove to everyone (especially her grandfather) that she is worthy.We seldom see young people depicted in such an honest manner.

""Whale Rider"" is a serious drama with a very spiritual & moving air and realistic tone.THE PLOT: A small tribe of Maori in modern-day New Zealand believe their presence there dates back a thousand years or more to a single ancestor, Paikea, who escaped death when his canoe capsized by riding to shore on the back of a whale. From then on chiefs of the Whangara tribe have been Paikea's direct descendants, always the first-born and always male. There is reoccuring evidence that Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal culture, is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition and stubbornness and insists on choosing a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must convince him and fight a thousand years of tradition for her calling to come to pass.""Whale Rider"" is an independent film with none of the trappings of modern blockbusters; the story is dialogue-driven, slow and not all that eventful, which can of course throw off those used to a steady diet of the latter. Take note before watching.I'll be perfectly honest with you, ""Whale Rider"" was a veritable religious experience for me. I had the dvd lying around for a few weeks and then one day I just knew the time was right: I put it in, not really intending to watch the entire film, and I was captivated from beginning to end (just over an hour and a half without credits). I was in a very spiritually-sensitive mode and literally cried through about 70% of it. The movie actually spoke to me in a sense, if you know what I mean, and I received clear direction in one area of searching/need. Don't dismiss this on the grounds that I'm some sentimental whack job; I'm just a regular dude.The thematic clash of the film is not granddaughter against grandfather but rather truth v.s. traditionalism, spirit of the law v.s. letter of the law, and true calling v.s. stubborn opposition.There's also an interesting subtheme about a culture losing its identity and languishing in drugs/alcohol, crime and meaningless despondency. How can they, as individuals and as a people, escape this? They must know their identity -- who they ARE.Some have criticized the film as too predictable, but I'd rather watch ""Whale Rider"" and it's predictable play-it-straight plot than moronic 'twist' films like ""A Perfect Getaway"" (2009) where the story is essentially a lie, leaving the viewer feeling ripped-off and hoodwinked. ""Whale Rider"" is refreshingly honest by comparison.

774515,A2XYGJ7FAK0QR7,B0000CABBW,"Zossima ""Zossima""","[1, 1]","This is the fourth movie I've seen in the past two years about women standing up to ethnic cultural barriers to their growth and realization of who they are and who they can be.  (And let's be fair: it's not just ethnic cultures that have put women down. Our own American melting pot culture still does to a large degree.)  The others:* Bend it Like Beckham* My Big Fat Greek Wedding* Real Women Have CurvesAll four are excellent.  Whale Rider is the most serious of the bunch.  It also presents a culture (New Zealand Maori) that is probably the most foreign to Americans.  And that was intriguing to me for its own sake.Whale Rider is about a group of Maori's waiting for a leader to be born.  That leader must be a man.  When young Pai, a girl is born, her grandfather largely rejects her because she is not the boy he wanted to come out of their kingly bloodline.  Pai secretly learns the ways of the Maori, including the ways of Maori warriors.  She learns and loves these things far more than the boys her grandfather identifies as potential leaders, including her own father and uncle.  She becomes the leader, and her grandfather finally realizes he has been wrong.One of the things I love about all of these movies is that the women reject the denigrating aspects of their cultures while still being present and choosing to love their families.  They embrace the noble and beautiful aspects of their cultures, while overcoming that which would keep them down.  In doing this, they show that culture can adapt and grow and still be beautiful and relevant.This is a beautiful movie.  It says much without a lot of words.  The actors, including and especially the actress who plays Pai, are excellent.",5,Another great film about women facing their ethnic cultures,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,1707,"['fourth', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'women', 'standing', 'up', 'ethnic', 'cultural', 'barriers', 'growth', 'realization', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'let', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'just', 'ethnic', 'cultures', 'have', 'put', 'women', 'down', 'own', 'American', 'melting', 'pot', 'culture', 'still', 'large', 'degree', 'others', '*', 'Bend', 'Beckham*', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding*', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'CurvesAll', 'four', 'are', 'excellent', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'most', 'serious', 'bunch', 'also', 'culture', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Maori', 'probably', 'most', 'foreign', 'Americans', 'was', 'intriguing', 'own', 'sake.Whale', 'Rider', 'group', 'Maori', 'waiting', 'leader', 'be', 'born', 'leader', 'must', 'be', 'man', 'When', 'young', 'Pai', 'girl', 'born', 'grandfather', 'largely', 'not', 'boy', 'wanted', 'come', 'kingly', 'bloodline', 'Pai', 'secretly', 'ways', 'Maori', 'including', 'ways', 'Maori', 'warriors', 'things', 'far', 'more', 'boys', 'grandfather', 'identifies', 'potential', 'leaders', 'including', 'own', 'father', 'uncle', 'leader', 'grandfather', 'finally', 'been', 'wrong.One', 'things', 'love', 'movies', 'women', 'reject', 'denigrating', 'aspects', 'cultures', 'still', 'being', 'present', 'choosing', 'love', 'families', 'embrace', 'noble', 'beautiful', 'aspects', 'cultures', 'overcoming', 'would', 'keep', 'down', 'doing', 'show', 'culture', 'can', 'adapt', 'grow', 'still', 'be', 'beautiful', 'relevant.This', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'much', 'lot', 'words', 'actors', 'including', 'especially', 'actress', 'who', 'Pai', 'are', 'excellent']",Whale Rider
