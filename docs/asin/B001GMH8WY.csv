Once you start watching the whole series you become involved and want to watch the whole 7 seasons.

1198185,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B001GMH8WY,D. Allen,"[9, 10]","When you buy this, please remember that it is actually the Seventh Season according to many websites such as [...] (the reason for this is because the first season was actually seasons one and two). With that said, according to the episode list, we only have ONE more release left and the entire awesome show is out on dvd!!!!!Anyway, this season isn't any exception to the others. It stars Chuck Norris as a Texas Ranger, and his partner Trivette. They go out and solve crimes. There are some interesting episodes for this release. I love the second part of The Wedding which feature Walker pulverizing criminals because they hurt his chick Alex. So Walker interviews people by first unplugging the camera system, then plugging it back in only to feature a bloody mess singing like a canary. Other great episodes include livegirls.now which features some of the show's ridiculous, unrealistic view of real life crimes.This dvd season comes differently than the previous ones. If you bought the previous seasons, you got a box set, with each case listing episodes and one dvd. This season is just one standard size DVD box with dvds stacked together in a book like fashion and the episodes are listing on transparent tabs on each side of the case. This feels a bit rushed and it looks odd on the shelf with my other collections. So this is a big no-no in my opinion. Hopefully cbs won't go cheap on the next release.",5,"Only one more to go, I think!!!!!",1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,1416,"['When', 'buy', 'please', 'remember', 'actually', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'according', 'many', 'websites', 'such', '[', ']', 'reason', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'actually', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'said', 'according', 'episode', 'list', 'only', 'have', 'ONE', 'more', 'release', 'left', 'entire', 'awesome', 'show', 'out', 'dvd', 'Anyway', 'season', ""n't"", 'exception', 'others', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'partner', 'Trivette', 'go', 'out', 'solve', 'crimes', 'are', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'release', 'love', 'second', 'part', 'Wedding', 'feature', 'Walker', 'pulverizing', 'criminals', 'hurt', 'chick', 'Alex', 'So', 'Walker', 'interviews', 'people', 'first', 'unplugging', 'camera', 'system', 'then', 'plugging', 'back', 'only', 'feature', 'bloody', 'mess', 'singing', 'canary', 'Other', 'great', 'episodes', 'include', 'livegirls.now', 'show', 'ridiculous', 'unrealistic', 'view', 'real', 'life', 'crimes.This', 'dvd', 'season', 'differently', 'previous', 'ones', 'bought', 'previous', 'seasons', 'got', 'box', 'set', 'case', 'listing', 'episodes', 'one', 'dvd', 'season', 'just', 'one', 'standard', 'size', 'DVD', 'box', 'dvds', 'stacked', 'together', 'book', 'fashion', 'episodes', 'are', 'listing', 'transparent', 'tabs', 'side', 'case', 'bit', 'rushed', 'odd', 'shelf', 'other', 'collections', 'big', 'no-no', 'opinion', 'Hopefully', 'cbs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'cheap', 'next', 'release']","Walker, Texas Ranger: Season 6"

Now with only one remaining to be released (Season 7) I can't wait for that realise.
