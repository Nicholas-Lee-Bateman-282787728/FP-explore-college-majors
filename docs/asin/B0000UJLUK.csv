784183,A234QLAT4EQHGV,B0000UJLUK,G. Morton,"[6, 6]","As a movie collector for decades who considers himself very critical & picky about films, I can't help myself, I love this movie. Yeah, it's maybe a little far-fetched or sentimental sometimes but there isn't a second of it that's not enjoyable - it's just too charming and well directed with exactly that effect in mind, and with a beautiful musical score, superb cinematography and a tight script. I think Ted Danson possibly gives his best performance ever as Washington Bellamy, an enraptured-with-knowledge elementary school teacher who also collects beautifully oddball classic cars. The story line described above about trying to match the distance the Apollo crew travels by simultaneously driving over a large part of the country to the Spires of the Moon National Park is already a remarkably charming idea. This will be his ""one perfect act""Washington Bellamy is a Don Quixote character, an idealistic and highly enthusiastic lover of nature & science who throughout the film is fighting ignorance rather than windmills and is enamored of the idea of a ""perfect act"". But along with strengths he has his faults, like all heroes, which come out painfully at several points in the film - so sensitive about faults that even his insignificant mix up of Galileo and Issac Newton attributions of a natural law pains him. His impractical view of life is symbolized toward the end by the breaking of the glass Pontiac hood piece by his more realistic son. Washington's wife, played so well by Mary Steenburgen, is the extreme opposite of her adventurous & idealistic husband - she doesn't even want to leave her house - and completely frustrates him. She is forced to overcome even extreme paranoia to chase after her impractical man and son.Of course, interesting adventures and troubles occur during the journeys but it's Washington's never failing enthusiasm for life and its wonders that really make the film's ideas all work. I've watched this film a number of times and will watch it again into old age and when I'm no longer able to enjoy it I'll be ready to die.",5,Love this movie,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,2074,"['movie', 'collector', 'decades', 'who', 'very', 'critical', 'picky', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'maybe', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'sentimental', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'second', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'too', 'charming', 'well', 'directed', 'exactly', 'effect', 'mind', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'tight', 'script', 'think', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'Washington', 'Bellamy', 'enraptured-with-knowledge', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'also', 'beautifully', 'oddball', 'classic', 'cars', 'story', 'line', 'described', 'about', 'trying', 'match', 'distance', 'Apollo', 'crew', 'travels', 'simultaneously', 'driving', 'over', 'large', 'part', 'country', 'Spires', 'Moon', 'National', 'Park', 'already', 'remarkably', 'charming', 'idea', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'perfect', 'act', 'Washington', 'Bellamy', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'character', 'idealistic', 'highly', 'enthusiastic', 'lover', 'nature', 'science', 'who', 'film', 'fighting', 'ignorance', 'rather', 'windmills', 'enamored', 'idea', 'perfect', 'act', 'strengths', 'faults', 'heroes', 'come', 'out', 'painfully', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'so', 'sensitive', 'faults', 'even', 'insignificant', 'mix', 'up', 'Galileo', 'Issac', 'Newton', 'attributions', 'natural', 'law', 'impractical', 'view', 'life', 'symbolized', 'end', 'breaking', 'glass', 'Pontiac', 'hood', 'piece', 'more', 'realistic', 'son', 'Washington', 'wife', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'extreme', 'opposite', 'adventurous', 'idealistic', 'husband', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'leave', 'house', 'completely', 'forced', 'overcome', 'even', 'extreme', 'paranoia', 'chase', 'impractical', 'man', 'son.Of', 'course', 'interesting', 'adventures', 'troubles', 'occur', 'journeys', 'Washington', 'never', 'failing', 'enthusiasm', 'life', 'wonders', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'ideas', 'work', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'number', 'times', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'old', 'age', 'when', ""'m"", 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'enjoy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ready', 'die']",N/A

One thing interesting, though, was to see how a Native American, (who fought in the Vietnam War, and whose people have been through genocide, assimilation processes, and abject poverty on reservations) is the one to offer Zen-like advice that is sorely needed for these white folks having trouble getting past a miscarriage brought on from a car accident.
