1158787,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00188M5TM,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 2]","Changeling is easily one of the most underrated films ever made (But now currently my new favorite film). Changeling only received a 61% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes because some whiny critics complained that it was boring (This is why people don't trust critics anymore). As far as I'm concerned, this is the finest drama I have ever witnessed that makes you feel and leaves a permanent impression. It's a very compelling and emotionally-driven experience. This is not just a film, it's an experience that a person should see at least once in their lives. An absolutely magnificent and flawlessly crafted film that reaches into your very soul.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: 1928; Los Angeles. Christine Collins is a single mother with a son named Walter and the two are very close. But one day after she comes home from work, she discovers that Walter has gone missing. After about five months, the Los Angeles police department claims to have found her son in Illinois. However, when the boy is brought to Los Angeles, she discovers that it isn't her son. Though she knows the boy is not her son, the police don't believe her and deny all of her claims. Christine becomes determined to find her son and with the help of a minister named Gustav Briegleb, she intends to expose the corruption in this police department. But things go from bad to even worse as she continues to make the police angry and now they want it all to go away by subjecting her to many terrible unjust things. This film will make you uncomfortable and will leave you speechless at the shocking plot twists as the truth begins to unravel. A thoroughly compelling and beautifully directed film that does indeed make a person feel (And if doesn't make you feel, you have no soul).MUSIC: On top of being a great director, Clint Eastwood also creates amazing music. Though subtle and nothing bombastic, it fits the mood perfectly well. I have no gripes with it at all.ACTING: When I first saw this film, I didn't see the box so I didn't know the main character was played by Angelina Jolie until I looked up reviews on the internet. I'm not saying she's a bad actress at all (In fact, she's great), I just wasn't expecting to see her go from a gun-toting hot female Indiana Jones in the Tomb Raider flicks to something like this. In my opinion, Angelina Jolie has set the bar for female performances in films, because hands down this is the best female performance I've ever seen and one of the best damn performances in a film, period. Every actor was simply amazing (Even the child actors were good, something I can't say about most films with child actors), and there were no moments in which the actors slacked. I wish all the people in this film would get more roles in films (God knows we need better actors in Hollywood right now).ACTION: If you're easily bored, you will despise this film because it is almost entirely dialogue-only. If you're that kind of person I don't want to hear from you. To start off, the cinematography, the visual look, and set pieces were simply outstanding. I was never bored watching this film because the performances of the actors and story made everything work to a tee. You really do feel for Christine Collins and feel horrified that women could be treated this way and what a corrupt police force can do. There's never a single moment in which you don't despise the corrupt police officers and their actions and root for her the whole way. This is a film that brings out emotion for just about everything and you care about what is happening. It's a beautiful, and yet haunted film.OVERALL: If you have taste in dramas, or good taste in film altogether, then Changeling is a must-have. This is a film that is not to be missed. A very underrated film that deserves much more attention than it got. The best damn drama I have ever seen.THE GOOD: Everything.THE BAD: Nothing.",5,A PERFECT DRAMA  10 OUT OF 10,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,3867,"['Changeling', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'now', 'currently', 'new', 'favorite', 'film', 'Changeling', 'only', 'received', '61', '%', 'Fresh', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'whiny', 'critics', 'complained', 'was', 'boring', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'critics', 'anymore', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'finest', 'drama', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'feel', 'permanent', 'impression', 'very', 'compelling', 'emotionally-driven', 'experience', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'experience', 'person', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'lives', 'absolutely', 'magnificent', 'flawlessly', 'crafted', 'film', 'very', 'soul.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', '1928', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'single', 'mother', 'son', 'named', 'Walter', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'one', 'day', 'home', 'work', 'Walter', 'gone', 'missing', 'five', 'months', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'police', 'department', 'claims', 'have', 'found', 'son', 'Illinois', 'However', 'when', 'boy', 'brought', 'Los', 'Angeles', ""n't"", 'son', 'boy', 'not', 'son', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'deny', 'claims', 'Christine', 'determined', 'find', 'son', 'help', 'minister', 'named', 'Gustav', 'Briegleb', 'expose', 'corruption', 'police', 'department', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'even', 'worse', 'make', 'police', 'angry', 'now', 'want', 'go', 'away', 'subjecting', 'many', 'terrible', 'unjust', 'things', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'will', 'leave', 'speechless', 'shocking', 'plot', 'twists', 'truth', 'unravel', 'thoroughly', 'compelling', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'film', 'indeed', 'make', 'person', 'feel', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'soul', '.MUSIC', 'top', 'being', 'great', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'also', 'amazing', 'music', 'Though', 'subtle', 'nothing', 'bombastic', 'mood', 'perfectly', 'well', 'have', 'gripes', 'all.ACTING', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'box', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'played', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'looked', 'up', 'reviews', 'internet', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'actress', 'fact', 'great', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'see', 'go', 'gun-toting', 'hot', 'female', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'flicks', 'something', 'opinion', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'set', 'bar', 'female', 'performances', 'films', 'down', 'best', 'female', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'best', 'damn', 'performances', 'film', 'period', 'actor', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Even', 'child', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'most', 'films', 'child', 'actors', 'were', 'moments', 'actors', 'slacked', 'wish', 'people', 'film', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'roles', 'films', 'God', 'need', 'better', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'right', 'now', '.ACTION', ""'re"", 'easily', 'bored', 'will', 'despise', 'film', 'almost', 'entirely', 'dialogue-only', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'start', 'off', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'look', 'set', 'pieces', 'were', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'watching', 'film', 'performances', 'actors', 'story', 'made', 'everything', 'work', 'tee', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'feel', 'horrified', 'women', 'could', 'be', 'treated', 'way', 'what', 'corrupt', 'police', 'force', 'can', 'do', 'never', 'single', 'moment', 'do', ""n't"", 'despise', 'corrupt', 'police', 'officers', 'actions', 'root', 'whole', 'way', 'film', 'out', 'emotion', 'just', 'everything', 'care', 'what', 'happening', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'haunted', 'film.OVERALL', 'have', 'taste', 'dramas', 'good', 'taste', 'film', 'altogether', 'then', 'Changeling', 'must-have', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'very', 'underrated', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'got', 'best', 'damn', 'drama', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.THE', 'GOOD', 'Everything.THE', 'BAD', 'Nothing']",Changeling Theatrical Release
1158788,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00188M5TM,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","The film begins in March 1928 Los Angeles (recreated for this film). A young boy is awakened by his mother. The Red Line trolley passes down the street. The boy goes to his school, the mother goes to work at the telephone company. The father left years ago. The next day the mother is called to work and leaves Walter at home. When she returns she finds her son is missing! She calls the police, they must wait 24 hours before seeking a missing child. Is the LAPD the most violent and corrupt police force west of the Rockies? In Illinois a young boy is left behind at a restaurant. Walter Collins has been found. ""People love a happy ending."" But its not her son! Or is she mistaken? The boy has no place else to go. When bathing the boy she discovers signs of an operation which her son didn't have. He is also 3 inches shorter than Walter. The police captain does not accept this. The ""best minds"" identified the boy. [Do the experts know what they are talking about?] Note the psychobabble of their expert. Is the report final? ""Goodnight Mommy."" [Mrs. Christine Collins has no relatives or neighbors to back up her story.]The Reverend Gustav Briegleb, a local pastor, calls about an article in the ""Los Angeles Times"". Did the police wipe out the competition from criminals? [Is this some hidden history of the 1920s?] Pastor Briegleb warns Christine about contradicting the police. The dentist finds differences in the teeth of her boy. Her boy does not know the teacher's name or his seat in class. Captain J.J. Jones accuses Mrs. Collins of insanity and puts her into the mental hospital. The experts provide a diagnosis to justify her imprisonment! Meanwhile a police detective looks for a missing youth, Sanford Clark from Canada, at a country farm. An inmate tells Christine about ""Code 12"" where police can place a troublesome person into a mental hospital. Is the system rigged against the victim? Young Sanford Clark tells the police detective about what happened1 It is a horrible story that accounts for some missing boys. Reverend Briegleb arrives to question Captain Jones about the abduction of Christine. One patient is tortured with electroshock treatment (the science of the day).That police detective gets backup and they go to that chicken farm. They dig up something and call the coroner, they will search for the owner. This news results in freedom for Christine. But there is bad news as well. There is an explanation as to how to make the problem go away. Reverend Briegleb explains to Christine what could happen to her in the future if the police go after her. [A frame-up for a crime?] A lawyer, Mr. Hahn, will represent her pro bono. Those imprisoned under ""Code 12"" are released. A civil suit against the city shakes things up in an election year. The police captain admits Christine was sent to the hospital without a warrant or a court order. The rest of the film has the endings. The drama continues to the end. [Would a rural farmhouse have electricity in 1928?]This film explains why there are civil rights for people: to protect the innocent who are an inconvenience to the authorities. Editing this film to 2 hours would make it better, it is too long (like this review?). This film omits some of the true facts to make this story more dramatic. Christine's husband was in prison, Gordon Northcott was 20 and lived with his parents on that farm. Sanford Clark's sister visited him and reported the conditions to the authorities.",5,A Story About a Missing Child,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,3468,"['film', 'March', '1928', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'recreated', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'awakened', 'mother', 'Red', 'Line', 'trolley', 'passes', 'down', 'street', 'boy', 'school', 'mother', 'work', 'telephone', 'company', 'father', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'next', 'day', 'mother', 'called', 'work', 'Walter', 'home', 'When', 'son', 'missing', 'police', 'must', 'wait', '24', 'hours', 'seeking', 'missing', 'child', 'LAPD', 'most', 'violent', 'corrupt', 'police', 'force', 'west', 'Rockies', 'Illinois', 'young', 'boy', 'left', 'behind', 'restaurant', 'Walter', 'Collins', 'been', 'found', 'People', 'love', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'son', 'mistaken', 'boy', 'place', 'else', 'go', 'When', 'bathing', 'boy', 'signs', 'operation', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'also', '3', 'inches', 'shorter', 'Walter', 'police', 'captain', 'not', 'accept', 'best', 'minds', 'identified', 'boy', 'Do', 'experts', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'talking', ']', 'Note', 'psychobabble', 'expert', 'report', 'final', 'Goodnight', 'Mommy', '[', 'Mrs.', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'relatives', 'neighbors', 'back', 'up', 'story', ']', 'Reverend', 'Gustav', 'Briegleb', 'local', 'pastor', 'article', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Times', 'Did', 'police', 'wipe', 'out', 'competition', 'criminals', '[', 'hidden', 'history', '1920s', ']', 'Pastor', 'Briegleb', 'Christine', 'contradicting', 'police', 'dentist', 'finds', 'differences', 'teeth', 'boy', 'boy', 'not', 'know', 'teacher', 'name', 'seat', 'class', 'Captain', 'J.J.', 'Jones', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'insanity', 'mental', 'hospital', 'experts', 'provide', 'diagnosis', 'justify', 'imprisonment', 'Meanwhile', 'police', 'detective', 'looks', 'missing', 'youth', 'Sanford', 'Clark', 'Canada', 'country', 'farm', 'inmate', 'tells', 'Christine', 'Code', '12', 'where', 'police', 'can', 'place', 'troublesome', 'person', 'mental', 'hospital', 'system', 'rigged', 'victim', 'Young', 'Sanford', 'Clark', 'police', 'detective', 'what', 'happened1', 'horrible', 'story', 'missing', 'boys', 'Reverend', 'Briegleb', 'question', 'Captain', 'Jones', 'abduction', 'Christine', 'One', 'patient', 'tortured', 'electroshock', 'treatment', 'science', 'day', 'police', 'detective', 'backup', 'go', 'chicken', 'farm', 'dig', 'up', 'something', 'call', 'coroner', 'will', 'search', 'owner', 'news', 'results', 'freedom', 'Christine', 'bad', 'news', 'well', 'explanation', 'how', 'make', 'problem', 'go', 'away', 'Reverend', 'Briegleb', 'Christine', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'future', 'police', 'go', '[', 'frame-up', 'crime', ']', 'A', 'lawyer', 'Mr.', 'Hahn', 'will', 'represent', 'pro', 'bono', 'imprisoned', 'Code', '12', 'are', 'released', 'A', 'civil', 'suit', 'city', 'shakes', 'things', 'up', 'election', 'year', 'police', 'captain', 'admits', 'Christine', 'was', 'sent', 'hospital', 'warrant', 'court', 'order', 'rest', 'film', 'endings', 'drama', 'end', '[', 'Would', 'rural', 'farmhouse', 'have', 'electricity', '1928', ']', 'film', 'why', 'are', 'civil', 'rights', 'people', 'protect', 'innocent', 'who', 'are', 'inconvenience', 'authorities', 'Editing', 'film', '2', 'hours', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'too', 'long', 'review', 'film', 'true', 'facts', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Christine', 'husband', 'was', 'prison', 'Gordon', 'Northcott', 'was', '20', 'lived', 'parents', 'farm', 'Sanford', 'Clark', 'sister', 'visited', 'reported', 'conditions', 'authorities']",Changeling Theatrical Release

1158792,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00188M5TM,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","Changeling / B001NFNFNUWhile it is often said that absolute power corrupts absolutely, there is a human tendency to want to hand as much power as possible to the people that we expect to protect us. ""Changeling"" reminds us forcefully that powerful people do not need to be overtly evil, corrupt, or malicious to abuse that power - garden-variety stubbornness, prejudice, and stupidity will do just as well.The fact that this is based on a true story makes this powerful drama all the more terrifying. Christine Collins is a single working mother, coping cheerfully with all the prejudices that immediately glom onto that title. Her son goes mysteriously missing one day and she enlists the help of the police, terrified but always very polite and submissive to authority. After several months of embarrassing failure to solve the case, the police produce a child and insist that he is the missing boy. Christine is immediately certain that this child is not her son, based on major physical and emotionally indicators, but she submissively takes the boy home, hoping to reason with the police, who seem constantly on the verge of bullying her. She quietly collects signed statements from dentists, school teachers, and neighbors while the police go on the attack, sending a hired psychologist to diagnose the mother as 'disturbed' and refusing to listen to her concerns. When a local politically active pastor uses his influence to get media attention to Christine's treatment, the police preemptively lock her in an asylum against her will, and subject her to regular, inhumane ""treatment"" in an effort to coerce her to sign a statement absolving them of responsibility.""Changeling"" has so many messages that they can hardly be contained in one movie, and yet like the protagonist, the movie is never pushy about its point. It simply is presented, quietly and firmly, and it is left to the viewer to take what they will. In many ways, ""Changeling"" shares the same space asAmerican Gangster, as a stunning example of how terribly wrong things can go when the people charged with protecting us decide to abuse that power. In other ways, ""Changeling"" is the sister movie toIron Jawed Angels, highlighting the sexism that underscored so much of the medical and professional attitudes towards women at the time, including how easy it was to lock women up as 'hysterical' and how a single mother is assumed to be 'easy' and more interested in other men than in providing a life for her child. And yet I cannot emphasize enough that these messages in ""Changeling"" are never pushed on the viewer - this is a movie with a great deal to say, and yet it says it so calmly and softly that we almost strain to listen. That takes a soft touch, something rare in Hollywood these days.Something else must be said in terms of the acting in ""Changeling"": it's superb. Truly, every actor in every scene does a wonderful job, and Jolie and Malkovich in particular shine. Ironically, the addition of Malkovich adds a probably-unintentional depth to the movie in that I kept waiting on pins and needles for him to turn out to be a 'bad guy' (a role he plays so very well and frequently), using Christine for his own agenda. I say 'ironic', because it occurs to the viewer later in the movie that whether he is using Christine is less important to whether Christine can get some use out of him - a layer of realism that I appreciated, for most real-life situations are naturally symbiotic, not good-guy/bad-guy driven.I cannot recommend ""Changeling"" enough for a terrifying look at the abuses of power and, really, as a nice eye-opener the next time someone says that ""people have too many rights"" or that it's ""too easy to sue"". Reasonable people can disagree as always, but it takes a movie like ""Changeling"" to impress upon us that sometimes the people we pay to protect us, protect only themselves.~ Ana Mardoll",5,Frightening View of Power,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,3893,"['Changeling', 'often', 'said', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', 'human', 'tendency', 'want', 'hand', 'as', 'much', 'power', 'possible', 'people', 'expect', 'protect', 'Changeling', 'forcefully', 'powerful', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'overtly', 'evil', 'corrupt', 'malicious', 'abuse', 'power', 'garden-variety', 'stubbornness', 'prejudice', 'stupidity', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'well.The', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'powerful', 'drama', 'more', 'terrifying', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'single', 'working', 'mother', 'coping', 'cheerfully', 'prejudices', 'immediately', 'glom', 'title', 'son', 'mysteriously', 'missing', 'one', 'day', 'help', 'police', 'terrified', 'always', 'very', 'polite', 'submissive', 'authority', 'several', 'months', 'embarrassing', 'failure', 'solve', 'case', 'police', 'produce', 'child', 'insist', 'missing', 'boy', 'Christine', 'immediately', 'certain', 'child', 'not', 'son', 'based', 'major', 'physical', 'emotionally', 'indicators', 'submissively', 'boy', 'home', 'hoping', 'reason', 'police', 'who', 'seem', 'constantly', 'verge', 'bullying', 'quietly', 'signed', 'statements', 'dentists', 'school', 'teachers', 'neighbors', 'police', 'go', 'attack', 'sending', 'hired', 'psychologist', 'diagnose', 'mother', ""'disturbed"", 'refusing', 'listen', 'concerns', 'When', 'local', 'politically', 'active', 'pastor', 'influence', 'get', 'media', 'attention', 'Christine', 'treatment', 'police', 'preemptively', 'asylum', 'will', 'subject', 'regular', 'inhumane', 'treatment', 'effort', 'coerce', 'sign', 'statement', 'absolving', 'responsibility', 'Changeling', 'so', 'many', 'messages', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'contained', 'one', 'movie', 'yet', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'never', 'pushy', 'point', 'simply', 'presented', 'quietly', 'firmly', 'left', 'viewer', 'take', 'what', 'will', 'many', 'ways', 'Changeling', 'shares', 'same', 'space', 'asAmerican', 'Gangster', 'stunning', 'example', 'how', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'when', 'people', 'charged', 'protecting', 'decide', 'abuse', 'power', 'other', 'ways', 'Changeling', 'sister', 'movie', 'toIron', 'Jawed', 'Angels', 'highlighting', 'sexism', 'underscored', 'so', 'much', 'medical', 'professional', 'attitudes', 'towards', 'women', 'time', 'including', 'how', 'easy', 'was', 'lock', 'women', 'up', 'as', ""'hysterical"", 'how', 'single', 'mother', 'assumed', 'be', ""'easy"", 'more', 'interested', 'other', 'men', 'providing', 'life', 'child', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'emphasize', 'enough', 'messages', 'Changeling', 'are', 'never', 'pushed', 'viewer', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'say', 'yet', 'so', 'calmly', 'softly', 'almost', 'strain', 'listen', 'soft', 'touch', 'something', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'days.Something', 'else', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'terms', 'acting', 'Changeling', 'superb', 'Truly', 'actor', 'scene', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Jolie', 'Malkovich', 'particular', 'shine', 'Ironically', 'addition', 'Malkovich', 'probably-unintentional', 'depth', 'movie', 'kept', 'waiting', 'pins', 'needles', 'turn', 'out', 'be', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'role', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'frequently', 'using', 'Christine', 'own', 'agenda', 'say', ""'ironic"", 'viewer', 'later', 'movie', 'using', 'Christine', 'less', 'important', 'Christine', 'can', 'get', 'use', 'layer', 'realism', 'appreciated', 'most', 'real-life', 'situations', 'are', 'naturally', 'symbiotic', 'not', 'good-guy/bad-guy', 'driven.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Changeling', 'enough', 'terrifying', 'look', 'abuses', 'power', 'really', 'nice', 'eye-opener', 'next', 'time', 'someone', 'people', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'rights', 'too', 'easy', 'sue', 'Reasonable', 'people', 'can', 'disagree', 'always', 'movie', 'Changeling', 'impress', 'people', 'pay', 'protect', 'protect', 'only', 'themselves.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Changeling Theatrical Release

But she finds a number of discrepancies indicating that the boy they found was not her son at all.  No matter what she does, the police insist that the son is hers, and go to some length to discredit her.The Good Things*Video/sound quality is essentially perfect.  The picture is very clean, clear, sharp, and vivid.*Includes a couple of documentaries concerning the making of the film.  If you get the Blu-Ray version, you will also get a ""Los Angeles:  Then and Now"" documentary, archival images and documents of the real-life incident, picture-in-picture interviews, and the BD-Live and U-Control features.*The movie is quite interesting, and is a thrilling, well-made drama.*It has a very slick production value that replicates the late 1920s and early 30s in a practical manner.*Photography is good.  There are some unique lighting effects and color schemes.*The characters are well-acted, especially the main character.*The story has a good story that is straightforward and easy to follow.  It is claimed to be based on a true story, and based on what I have read, some parts of the movie sound somewhat true.*The movie has a number of invoking scenes that lets us emphasize with the characters and see the injustice of the whole incident (I had to utter ""what a bunch of jerks!"" when I saw the cops arresting this woman for no good reason...).

Angelina Jolie's acting was surprisingly awesome; I swear that her character doesn't look, sound, or act like she usually does.  The drama is surprisingly gripping and intense.

Clint Eastwood has once again shown that he really can adapt to a huge variety of stories and still deliver a wonderful end product.  Why should I ever have doubted the man?  His list of achievements is now so significant that to doubt him is to err.In ""Changeling"", Eastwood tells the story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) who is a single mother bringing up a young boy in suburban Los Angeles in the late 1920s.  She returns home one day to find the boy missing.  She raises the matter with police who, after a number of months, claim that the boy has been found in rural Illinois.  However, upon being reunited with the child, she is shocked to learn that it is not her child.  She remonstrates with the authorities who fob her off with the line that she must be mistaken.  Of course, she doesn't take this lying down and continues to agitate.  The authorities eventually have her committed to an asylum as insane.  Not much due process here!Jolie is captivating as the mother.  She achieves the role magnificently.  John Malkovich as the crusading pastor trying to root out corruption in the LAPD is a revelation.  Malkovich is a very talented actor.  Yet, the real star is probably the director, Client Eastwood, who brought the film in under-budget but cut no corners.  The film truly hangs together well.My strong recommendation is to see this film.

1158797,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00188M5TM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","When watching `Changeling', one can't help but get the feeling that they are being told exactly how to feel.  The film is very, very thick with manipulated intentions that weigh on the audience.  The film basically drips with manufactured emotional consequence, feeding you the feelings you're going to embody and delivering one harrowing moment after another.  This is a film that desperately wants attention (of the awards body kind), a film that knows exactly what to do in order to ensure that you are going to walk away with the desired emotional impact.Like I said; it kind of works.The main issue I have with `Changeling' is that it tries so hard that it fails to incorporate something essential, something human.  Instead of delivering us layers of emotion, we are delivered almost one unmovable line of high-octane intensity.  This is a film that wants an Oscar, and it knows that Oscar very rarely looks in the direction of subtlety.  Oscar, as a rule, prefers flashy.That is what `Changeling' offers.There was a lot of flak given to Angelina Jolie upon the time of this film's release, especially when she started attaining acting nominations.  I have seen parody after parody of her ""I WANT MY SON BACK"" moaning and I have to admit, I find them amusing.  Sadly, it is not Jolie that should be getting the flak, but the writers.  The script itself doesn't give Jolie anything to really work with.  She has one range here, and she sticks to it rather well.  In fact, her performance isn't one to balk at, and in the film's quieter moments she really shines (those courtroom scenes where she says absolutely nothing are hauntingly effective).  Sadly, she is reduced to a screaming mother throughout half the film, and that grows tiresome, and clich&eacute;d.I will say this, I had no idea what this movie was about when I first saw it.  I mean, from the buzz and the speculation, I kind of thought it was something supernatural.  Thankfully, that is not the case.  The film claims to be based on a true story, but it is apparent that some facts have been changed in order to create more tension and even to tie in some loose ends.  The fact remains that this film concerns a mother's search for her missing son.  Due to police corruption, this mother is reunited with a boy who is not hers, and when she tries to convince the police of that fact she is thrown in a psychiatric ward.  It isn't until a major break in the case is discovered that her name is cleared, paving the way for her to take even more action against the police force.The film has a few notable flaws, outside of the one I already mentioned.  It does come off rather stuffed in the end, as it becomes apparent that they are trying to fit a lot in here.  The films focus seems to get jumbled in all the plot lines running in and out of it.  Also, the acting is uneven.  The performances range from good to bad to sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Like I mentioned, Jolie has her moments, but the script doesn't do her any favors.  Devon Conti doesn't have to do anything except be unintentionally creepy, and this is a slight deterrent from the film.  It is ridiculously apparent that the kid is NOT her son from the clich&eacute;d way he carries himself.  I'm not a fan of John Malkovich, but he doesn't make any major errors here.  Jason Butler Harner fares best here, and actually turns in a layered performance that makes you want to know more.  I almost wish the film had been about his character, although I wouldn't really want to watch much more about the awful things he did.  Eddie Alderson is pretty bad and unbelievable as Sanford, especially his breakdown scene; very `actory'.  Amy Ryan is, once again, a clich&eacute;.  As much as I HATED his character, Jeffrey Donovan was extremely good here, completely diving straight into a frustratingly ruthless character.All of this said; it kind of works.It's funny, because you would figure that, with this many issues, I'd be warning you to stay away, but the way that this film is pieced together makes for a really rewarding experience.  I actually really like this film (thus the B grade).  It is obvious on many accounts, but it is also very intense and pretty moving, even if it is manipulated to an extreme.  The sets are gorgeous (and Jolie has rarely looked this luminous).  The film is beautiful to look at, from the costumes to the cinematography.  Everything fits nicely together, and even though it tries to stuff a lot into the films conclusion, it manages to make it work because it is not afraid of running over that two-hour mark.  So, regardless of the negative points, I still highly recommend this film.I bet you didn't see that coming.",4,"Manufactured, manipulated tensions that kind of work...",1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,4690,"['When', 'watching', 'Changeling', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'being', 'told', 'exactly', 'how', 'feel', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'thick', 'manipulated', 'intentions', 'weigh', 'audience', 'film', 'basically', 'manufactured', 'emotional', 'consequence', 'feeding', 'feelings', ""'re"", 'going', 'embody', 'delivering', 'one', 'harrowing', 'moment', 'film', 'desperately', 'attention', 'awards', 'body', 'kind', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'order', 'ensure', 'are', 'going', 'walk', 'away', 'desired', 'emotional', 'impact.Like', 'said', 'kind', 'works.The', 'main', 'issue', 'have', 'Changeling', 'so', 'hard', 'incorporate', 'something', 'essential', 'something', 'human', 'Instead', 'delivering', 'layers', 'emotion', 'are', 'delivered', 'almost', 'one', 'unmovable', 'line', 'high-octane', 'intensity', 'film', 'Oscar', 'Oscar', 'very', 'rarely', 'direction', 'subtlety', 'Oscar', 'rule', 'prefers', 'flashy.That', 'what', 'Changeling', 'offers.There', 'was', 'lot', 'flak', 'given', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'especially', 'when', 'started', 'attaining', 'acting', 'nominations', 'have', 'seen', 'parody', 'parody', 'WANT', 'MY', 'SON', 'BACK', 'moaning', 'have', 'admit', 'find', 'amusing', 'Sadly', 'not', 'Jolie', 'should', 'be', 'getting', 'flak', 'writers', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'Jolie', 'anything', 'really', 'work', 'one', 'range', 'here', 'rather', 'well', 'fact', 'performance', ""n't"", 'one', 'balk', 'film', 'quieter', 'moments', 'really', 'shines', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'where', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'are', 'hauntingly', 'effective', 'Sadly', 'reduced', 'screaming', 'mother', 'film', 'tiresome', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.I', 'will', 'say', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'mean', 'buzz', 'speculation', 'kind', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'supernatural', 'Thankfully', 'not', 'case', 'film', 'claims', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'apparent', 'facts', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'order', 'create', 'more', 'tension', 'even', 'tie', 'loose', 'ends', 'fact', 'film', 'mother', 'search', 'missing', 'son', 'Due', 'police', 'corruption', 'mother', 'reunited', 'boy', 'who', 'not', 'hers', 'when', 'convince', 'police', 'fact', 'thrown', 'psychiatric', 'ward', ""n't"", 'major', 'break', 'case', 'discovered', 'name', 'cleared', 'paving', 'way', 'take', 'even', 'more', 'action', 'police', 'force.The', 'film', 'few', 'notable', 'flaws', 'one', 'already', 'mentioned', 'come', 'off', 'rather', 'stuffed', 'end', 'apparent', 'are', 'trying', 'fit', 'lot', 'here', 'films', 'focus', 'get', 'jumbled', 'plot', 'lines', 'running', 'Also', 'acting', 'uneven', 'performances', 'range', 'good', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'good', 'sometimes', 'bad', 'mentioned', 'Jolie', 'moments', 'script', ""n't"", 'do', 'favors', 'Devon', 'Conti', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'be', 'unintentionally', 'creepy', 'slight', 'deterrent', 'film', 'ridiculously', 'apparent', 'kid', 'NOT', 'son', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'John', 'Malkovich', ""n't"", 'make', 'major', 'errors', 'here', 'Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'best', 'here', 'actually', 'layered', 'performance', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'almost', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'watch', 'much', 'more', 'awful', 'things', 'did', 'Eddie', 'Alderson', 'pretty', 'bad', 'unbelievable', 'Sanford', 'especially', 'breakdown', 'scene', 'very', 'actory', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'once', 'again', 'clich', 'eacute', 'As', 'much', 'HATED', 'character', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'was', 'extremely', 'good', 'here', 'completely', 'diving', 'straight', 'frustratingly', 'ruthless', 'character.All', 'said', 'kind', 'works.It', 'funny', 'would', 'figure', 'many', 'issues', ""'d"", 'be', 'warning', 'stay', 'away', 'way', 'film', 'pieced', 'together', 'really', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'actually', 'really', 'film', 'thus', 'B', 'grade', 'obvious', 'many', 'accounts', 'also', 'very', 'intense', 'pretty', 'moving', 'even', 'manipulated', 'extreme', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Jolie', 'rarely', 'looked', 'luminous', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'Everything', 'fits', 'nicely', 'together', 'even', 'stuff', 'lot', 'films', 'conclusion', 'make', 'work', 'not', 'afraid', 'running', 'over', 'two-hour', 'mark', 'So', 'regardless', 'negative', 'points', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film.I', 'bet', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming']",Changeling Theatrical Release

If it was fiction, nobody would bother with it. It would sound too contrived, too improbable. It is, however, true.Jolie plays Christine Collins, a Los Angeles single mom in 1928 who comes home one day in March from an extra stint of work (supervisor at the phone company) to find her 9-year-old son Walter is missing. She searches the neighborhood and then calls the police, who say they can't do anything until 24 hours, because most kids just come home. Nonetheless, a policeman is there the next morning, taking the information, and assuring her that they will be looking for Walter. Still, nothing much seems to be happening. Finally, in August, she gets a visit from the investigator on her case (and apparently several reporters) telling her they have found her son and he's on his way home from the midwest where he was in the company of a drifter.But when she gets to the train station, she discovers that the boy is not her son, although he claims his name is Walter Collins. She is pressured to take him home, and guilt-tripped by being told ""he has nobody but you, nowhere else to go."" She takes him home and when he takes a bath, she discovers he is circumcised, while Walter was not. She puts him against the doorway where she had marked Walter's height not long before he disappeared, and this kid is at least three inches shorter. So who is he and why are the police and everyone else insisting he is her son?You wouldn't want me to spoil the story, would you?Let's just say this poor woman went through hell trying to find out what became of her son. A local minister, played by John Malkovich, tries to help her, and believes she is not insane as the police insist. He has been crusading against the corrupt police force for years, and knows what happens to people who embarrass them. She is effectively insisting that they admit they made a mistake (or even perpetrated a fraud) in bringing her a boy who was not her son.It's a pretty grim story, all told, but you can't help admiring Christine Collins and her determination.

Clocking in at just over 2 hours and 20 minutes.You know the story by now- a mother comes home to find that her son is missing.  She does EVERYTHING in her power to try and find him, except, since the story takes place in the late 1920's, a young single woman has to face another challenge- trying to convince the local police her son is actually missing.The cops are so crooked they actually think the mother isn't really concerned over her son and believes she WANTS her son to remain missing so she can start another life with possibly someone else, lol.  That's just one of many irrational theories a certain officer at this police department had in mind.What makes Changeling so unbelievably good is the writing.  It's solid, it's brilliant, it's moving, and to be completely honest, it might even be perfection.*Every single scene* is the very definition of captivating.  Angelina Jolie gives us a performance I wasn't sure the girl even had in her.  She plays the concerned/emotional mother role perfectly the entire time.When the police try convincing her that a completely unrelated child is her own son, the story intensifies.  When the police pretend Angelina's character has mental problems and doesn't even realize her own son is standing right in front of her which prompts the police to send her to a mental hospital for a lengthy visit, the story intensifies even *more*.Guess what?  That's only HALF of the things that makes this film so good.

No, I'm not talking about the last eight years under George W. Bush. This is 1928 Los Angeles, and a single mother named Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie,Wanted) returns home from work to find her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) missing. After frantic calls to the local police department, the next day a patrol car is sent out and a missing person's report is filed. Five months later Walter is found and brought home ...but it isn't Walter. He  was taller ...and was not circumcised. Ms. Collins pleads with the police to find her son and take back this imposter but the police refuse.Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan,Hitch) of the LAPD tries to make Ms. Collins seem crazy or out of touch. He goes so far as to have her incarcerated at a mental institution where she finds other women like herself who have challenged the authority of the police only to have everything taken away.Meanwhile we learn that an insane man named Gordon Stewart Northcott (Jason Butler Harner,John Adamsminiseries) has kidnapped many children and taken them to his distant ranch where unthinkable things were done. Most of this was discovered when a Canadian child illegally in the U.S. spills the goods to a semi-decent cop, Detective Ybarra (Michael Kelly,Dawn of the Dead) who tries to bring this to the attention of his superiors only to be rebuffed because ""it doesn't look good for the department.""On Ms. Collins' side (even while she's in the loony bin) is Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich,Burn After Reading) who learns of Christine's problems with the LAPD and already has a running battle going on with them over their autocratic style. His assistance is invaluable in aiding in Christine's release from the mental institution ...as well as releasing the other women who were wrongfully imprisoned on behalf of the LAPD.History tells us that Mr. Northcott gets what's coming to him. He's a slightly pitiable and disgusting fellow who was probably completely insane. Actor Jason Harner played him exceptionally well; a creepy and frightening premonition from the past. We also learn that several LAPD higher-ups get canned in the wake of the breaking news about the despicable things the authorities have done.Most of the praise obviously goes to Angeline Jolie for her excellent portrayal of Christine Collins. You can feel the rising tension as she battles to find her son and butts up against the walls of ""justice."" Frustration is palpable. And you hope beyond hope that little Walter survived his ordeal. But did he?History tells us he probably didn't. But who knows. He could be a changeling, wandering out there, lost amidst the masses.

1158809,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B00188M5TM,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[7, 10]","Beware.  To see it is to become emotionally involved with ""Changeling.""  This is drama at its most intense.  Even if you don't imagine yourself as Mrs. Collins or her son, you will nonetheless empathize with them.  You will embrace their anxiety, fear, and terror.  You will imagine how they feel, alone and afraid.  And you will be horrified at the injustices they suffer at the hands of those who are supposed to defend and protect.Previous reviewers have explained the story so I'll try to tell you how it felt.  First, if you are drawn into the story like I was, the extended length of this movie is a blessing.  As the film approached a point where I knew conclusion would have been acceptable, I kept hoping, quite literally, for new life.Angelina Jolie is absolutely convincing as the single mother, Mrs. Collins.  No one does raw power, and simultaneously, sensual vulnerability, better than Jolie.  And Malkovich was very creative casting for the minister, a ruthless champion of justice.Clint Eastwood is now delivering movies with greater depth (in addition to violence, death, novelty and clever plot angles).  He is surrounding himself with plenty of seasoned talent, including Ron Howard (as one of the producers.)  In fact, I had difficulty finding any usual Eastwood watermarks.  That is, until the frail Mrs. Collins repeatedly slams the serial killer against the bars of the interview room, trying to get him to tell her whether he murdered her son.  I almost expected her to ask, ""Do you feel lucky, punk?""  Actually, what I expected her to ask nearly everyone who worked against her, particularly the Police Captain and the various doctors, was ""Do you have a soul?""From time to time during the film I listened to the audience in the theatre, such as when Mrs. Collins tells off the corrupt physician at the mental hospital. A few people, not yet engrossed by the horror of the situation, laughed (supportively).  Yet by the end of the film, when Mrs. Collins speaks to the detective, and when the credits rolled and the lights came up, you could have heard a pin drop.The most powerful moments where those times when Mrs. Collins' teetered on the verge of resignation - abandoned by her husband, confronted with the loss of her only child, and now surrounded by those who did not care, would not care, or were trying to hurt her.  Yet each time, with extraordinary courage and usually alone, she stood resolute against her worst fears.By a long shot however, the most emotional moment in the movie for me was the short scene of the boys in the chicken coop, with the brief image of the exhausted and dirt stained little Walter Collins.  If your heart didn't break at that moment, you don't have one.I would have suggested a different title, other than ""Changeling,"" which was a term used by the doctor at the mental hospital.  Before seeing the movie, the title ""Changeling"" seemed indicative of cheap Sci-Fi, rather than world class drama.  If you are a fan of 1920s period sets, the people who designed the physical backgrounds, clothing, and accessories for ""Changeling"" deserve an academy award for the quality and detail.Generally speaking, many people here in the modern United States have come to rely on trustworthy, lawful, and well-intentioned strangers who by the nature of their roles in society, generally act in ways we expect.  But what if you are vulnerable, weak, or threatening?  What if you are female, a minority, or foreign?  Experiences like these bring their own terrors.  Other movies which eloquently speak to these fears include ""The Visitor,"" and ""Babel.""  I highly recommend all three.",5,Alone and Afraid,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,3634,"['Beware', 'see', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'Changeling', 'drama', 'most', 'intense', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'son', 'will', 'nonetheless', 'empathize', 'will', 'embrace', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'terror', 'will', 'imagine', 'how', 'feel', 'alone', 'afraid', 'will', 'be', 'horrified', 'injustices', 'suffer', 'hands', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'defend', 'protect.Previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'explained', 'story', 'so', ""'ll"", 'try', 'tell', 'how', 'felt', 'First', 'are', 'drawn', 'story', 'was', 'extended', 'length', 'movie', 'blessing', 'film', 'approached', 'point', 'where', 'knew', 'conclusion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'acceptable', 'kept', 'hoping', 'quite', 'literally', 'new', 'life.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'single', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'one', 'raw', 'power', 'simultaneously', 'sensual', 'vulnerability', 'better', 'Jolie', 'Malkovich', 'was', 'very', 'creative', 'casting', 'minister', 'ruthless', 'champion', 'justice.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'now', 'delivering', 'movies', 'greater', 'depth', 'addition', 'violence', 'death', 'novelty', 'clever', 'plot', 'angles', 'surrounding', 'plenty', 'seasoned', 'talent', 'including', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'one', 'producers', 'fact', 'had', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'usual', 'Eastwood', 'watermarks', 'frail', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'repeatedly', 'slams', 'serial', 'killer', 'bars', 'interview', 'room', 'trying', 'get', 'tell', 'murdered', 'son', 'almost', 'expected', 'ask', 'Do', 'feel', 'lucky', 'punk', 'Actually', 'what', 'expected', 'ask', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'particularly', 'Police', 'Captain', 'various', 'doctors', 'was', 'Do', 'have', 'soul', 'time', 'time', 'film', 'listened', 'audience', 'theatre', 'such', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'corrupt', 'physician', 'mental', 'hospital', 'few', 'people', 'not', 'yet', 'engrossed', 'horror', 'situation', 'laughed', 'supportively', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'detective', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'lights', 'came', 'up', 'could', 'have', 'heard', 'pin', 'drop.The', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'where', 'times', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'teetered', 'verge', 'resignation', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'confronted', 'loss', 'only', 'child', 'now', 'surrounded', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'would', 'not', 'care', 'were', 'trying', 'hurt', 'time', 'extraordinary', 'courage', 'usually', 'alone', 'stood', 'resolute', 'worst', 'fears.By', 'long', 'shot', 'however', 'most', 'emotional', 'moment', 'movie', 'was', 'short', 'scene', 'boys', 'chicken', 'coop', 'brief', 'image', 'exhausted', 'dirt', 'stained', 'little', 'Walter', 'Collins', 'heart', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'moment', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one.I', 'would', 'have', 'suggested', 'different', 'title', 'other', 'Changeling', 'was', 'term', 'used', 'doctor', 'mental', 'hospital', 'seeing', 'movie', 'title', 'Changeling', 'seemed', 'indicative', 'cheap', 'Sci-Fi', 'rather', 'world', 'class', 'drama', 'are', 'fan', '1920s', 'period', 'sets', 'people', 'who', 'designed', 'physical', 'backgrounds', 'clothing', 'accessories', 'Changeling', 'deserve', 'academy', 'award', 'quality', 'detail.Generally', 'speaking', 'many', 'people', 'here', 'modern', 'United', 'States', 'have', 'come', 'rely', 'trustworthy', 'lawful', 'well-intentioned', 'strangers', 'who', 'nature', 'roles', 'society', 'generally', 'act', 'ways', 'expect', 'what', 'are', 'vulnerable', 'weak', 'threatening', 'What', 'are', 'female', 'minority', 'foreign', 'Experiences', 'bring', 'own', 'terrors', 'Other', 'movies', 'eloquently', 'speak', 'fears', 'include', 'Visitor', 'Babel', 'highly', 'recommend', 'three']",Changeling Theatrical Release

I will hint at one thing, for those who have seen it, and that hint is chicken farm. I was incredibly upset by the way Clint Eastwood shot that memory scene as described by one character. Please be warned. It was required to appreciate the deserved fate of one character toward the end. I however question if that whole aspect of the story needed to be in as much detail as presented. Because of it, I can't watch the film ever again.The film itself starts out in 1928 Los Angeles. Clint Eastwood gets the era totally right as far as costumes and scenes. I wonder if he studied Hal Roach comedies like Laurel and Hardy and Our Gang or Harold Lloyd comedies. So many of these films involved much street location filming and Clint Eastwood just matches it perfectly. I imagine computer graphics were employed to present 1928 Los Angeles.The police corruption, the mystery of the boy's disappearence, etc. are very involving. I just wish the chicken farm component was played down.By the way, in a small part can be seen one of my favorite actors, Amy Ryan.

1158815,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00188M5TM,Caleb Williams,"[5, 7]","2008 will undoubtedly be a memorable year for Hollywoods power couple, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Pitt had the magnificent ""Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" which gained him a 2009 Best Actor Nomination and ""Changeling"" won Angelina a 2009 Best Actress Nomination. There were both given due to high levels of acting justification displayed by both sides, but most intensely on the side of Jolie.""Changeling"" sees Jolie playing Christine Collins, a single Mother who made the headlines when her 9 year old son Walter, went missing. After 5 weeks of searching the L.A.P.D. claimed to have found a boy claiming to be Walter. A public reunion was organised between the mother and lost son, as a media circus to try and take away the attention from corruption scandals within the L.A.P.D. The boy is reunited with Collins but she claims he is not her son, but is forced to take him home ""on a trial basis"" so as to avoid police embarassment.Christine Collins keeps up the pressure on the Police to find her real son, but thanks to the cruelty of Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) her pleas are not listened to and she's forced to take matters into her own hands. She gets dental records and teacher testimonials to confirm the boy who's claimed to be her son in fact is not. Jones gets a bit tired of all the hassle he's receiving and the negative press attention to case is receiving, so he authorises her to be locked in a mental hospital. Not all is lost as her guardian angel Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). He and his congregation are the only people who believe her and they join the fight to find out the truth and rid L.A. of corruption.The setting of 1920's Los Angeles is cleverly depicted and helps make the story and its characters all the more authentic. Clint Eastwood has a genuine talent for creating an emotional moment and drawing its audience in and engaging them with the characters. This is obviously helped with the use of 5 star actors and that is no more apparent here. Angelina Jolie plays the role amazingly and next to Gia, in my eyes this is one of her best genuine acting performances. She didn't need to sex up the role, or become all angry and violent, she just told the story of a Mother who had lost her son and wasn't believed by the people who were meant to protect her.John Malkovich plays a good role as Briegleb and seemed to delve so deep in the role, I actually didn't recognise it was him until I saw the credits at the end. Jeffrey Donovans, J.J. Jones comes across as sincerely evil and sadistic and just unconcerned with this womans plight.The fact that this story is based on factual events makes the film all the more terrifying. How the Police Department could destroy a womans and their publics trust by trying to cover up their mistake for PR purposes. Of course there are aspects of the story that are either changed or removed completely for the sakes of the film, which is OK as they're relatively small aspects that have been amendedIt's an amazing film and possibly Angelina's best, and if she does win that Oscar she's nominated for, then it's well deserved.",5,"2008, A Great Year For Brangelina",1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,3125,"['2008', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'memorable', 'year', 'Hollywoods', 'power', 'couple', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Pitt', 'had', 'magnificent', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'gained', '2009', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Nomination', 'Changeling', 'won', 'Angelina', '2009', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Nomination', 'were', 'given', 'due', 'high', 'levels', 'acting', 'justification', 'displayed', 'sides', 'most', 'intensely', 'side', 'Jolie', 'Changeling', 'sees', 'Jolie', 'playing', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'single', 'Mother', 'who', 'made', 'headlines', 'when', '9', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Walter', 'went', 'missing', '5', 'weeks', 'searching', 'L.A.P.D', 'claimed', 'have', 'found', 'boy', 'claiming', 'be', 'Walter', 'A', 'public', 'reunion', 'was', 'organised', 'mother', 'lost', 'son', 'media', 'circus', 'try', 'take', 'away', 'attention', 'corruption', 'scandals', 'L.A.P.D', 'boy', 'reunited', 'Collins', 'not', 'son', 'forced', 'take', 'home', 'trial', 'basis', 'so', 'avoid', 'police', 'embarassment.Christine', 'Collins', 'up', 'pressure', 'Police', 'find', 'real', 'son', 'thanks', 'cruelty', 'Captain', 'J.J.', 'Jones', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'pleas', 'are', 'not', 'listened', 'forced', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'dental', 'records', 'teacher', 'testimonials', 'confirm', 'boy', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'son', 'fact', 'not', 'Jones', 'bit', 'tired', 'hassle', 'receiving', 'negative', 'press', 'attention', 'case', 'receiving', 'be', 'locked', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Not', 'lost', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Reverend', 'Gustav', 'Briegleb', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'congregation', 'are', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'join', 'fight', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'rid', 'L.A.', 'corruption.The', 'setting', '1920', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'cleverly', 'depicted', 'helps', 'make', 'story', 'characters', 'more', 'authentic', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'genuine', 'talent', 'creating', 'emotional', 'moment', 'drawing', 'audience', 'engaging', 'characters', 'obviously', 'helped', 'use', '5', 'star', 'actors', 'more', 'apparent', 'here', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'role', 'amazingly', 'next', 'Gia', 'eyes', 'one', 'best', 'genuine', 'acting', 'performances', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'sex', 'up', 'role', 'become', 'angry', 'violent', 'just', 'told', 'story', 'Mother', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'son', 'was', ""n't"", 'believed', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'meant', 'protect', 'her.John', 'Malkovich', 'good', 'role', 'Briegleb', 'seemed', 'delve', 'so', 'deep', 'role', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognise', 'was', 'saw', 'credits', 'end', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovans', 'J.J.', 'Jones', 'sincerely', 'evil', 'sadistic', 'just', 'unconcerned', 'plight.The', 'fact', 'story', 'based', 'factual', 'events', 'film', 'more', 'terrifying', 'How', 'Police', 'Department', 'could', 'destroy', 'womans', 'publics', 'trust', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'mistake', 'PR', 'purposes', 'course', 'are', 'aspects', 'story', 'are', 'changed', 'removed', 'completely', 'sakes', 'film', 'OK', ""'re"", 'relatively', 'small', 'aspects', 'have', 'been', 'amendedIt', 'amazing', 'film', 'possibly', 'Angelina', 'best', 'win', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'then', 'well', 'deserved']",Changeling Theatrical Release

""Charlie""","[8, 11]","I didn't know what to think honestly when I went to see this movie with friends a few months ago--I mean, I saw the previews and all of that and they made it seem, well, quite boring--but I knew that, after seeing Angelina Jolie in 2 prior films with a similar tone to this ('A Mighty Heart' and 'The Good Shepherd' respectivitely), my views were destine to change.  'Changeling' is the story of a single mother whose son is kidnapped by a ruthless child predator, and her fight to see his return despite the LAPD's attempts to deem her insane when she denies the young boy they push upon her is hers.The story is very interesting, and while the film starts out slow, it quickly gains momentum once she discovers her son is missing.  From the police investigation to her caring for the son that is not hers, to her being confined to an asylum for refusing to cooperate with the police department and the secrets revealed about the inmates' incarcerations, to the hunt for the man responsible and everything about him...it was just, at best I can describe it, a thrill ride.  I wasn't expecting it, but it put me in the mind of 'Silence of the Lambs' during some parts of the movie, in particular the search for the kidnapper.The movie is long I should warn.

1158824,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00188M5TM,Chris Pandolfi,"[170, 179]","Clint Eastwood's ""Changeling"" is not easy to watch, but I implore you to give it a try. This is filmmaking at its finest. It's all at once heartbreaking, infuriating, touching, empowering, and immensely compelling, which is to say that it taps into core human emotions without being manipulative. It tells a story so absorbing, it's as if the movie is happening to us instead of just passing before our eyes. This is appropriate given the fact that it's a true story and not merely based on a true story; screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski relied on actual articles, transcripts, and testimonies to document the story of Los Angeles native Christine Collins, whose nine-year-old son, Walter, disappeared in March of 1928. Five months later, the LAPD returned a boy Collins knew was not her son. Because the police refused to admit that a mistake was made, they deemed Collins an unfit mother and subsequently had her committed to a mental institution. But she wouldn't be silenced, and with the help of some key figures, she took on one of the most shameful cases of police corruption in Los Angeles history.Angelina Jolie gives yet another wonderful performance as Collins, an honest, caring woman who was clearly striving for independence in a male-dominated society. She works diligently as the supervisor for a telephone company, so much so that she's offered a managerial position. As a single mother, she's firm yet nurturing, and she's upfront with her son (Gattlin Griffith) about why his father left before he was born. After Walter's disappearance, and after the wrong boy is returned to her, she initially faces the LAPD on her own, which leaves her with little since it's a tyrannical system motivated by power, not justice. There's a pivotal scene in which Chief of Police James E. Davis (Colm Feore) makes the following announcement: ""We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy on a criminal."" This is immediately followed by a shot of officers executing a line of criminals in the middle of a dark street. An elimination of the competition. For a system this dishonest, a persistent woman like Collins is seen as nothing but a disruption.Of all the authority figures in this film, Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) is by far the most deplorable. He's obstinate and domineering, bullying Collins into taking in an imposter child, who was found with a drifter in DeKalb, Illinois. Jones has the nerve to question Collins as a mother, claiming she was so happy her son was taken that she's now resorting to phony accusations. Her insistence that he carry on the investigation lands her in a dehumanizing psychiatric hospital, where numerous disruptive women are sent to endure constant medicating and cruel electroshock therapy. A kindly but broken prostitute (Amy Ryan) tells Collins that there's absolutely no winning with the doctors. If you smile too much, you're delusional. If you smile too little, you're depressed. If you're neutral, then you've lost touch with basic human emotions. All anyone can do is learn how to behave properly.The only person on Collins' side is Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a Presbyterian minister and community activist who made it his life's work to expose the corruption of the LAPD during radio sermons. When Collins is committed, Briegleb takes it upon himself to publicize the disappearance of her son and rally the public to support her. This puts tremendous pressure on the LAPD, as does the recent discovery of a crime scene; buried beneath a chicken ranch in Wineville, California are human remains. A mechanic named Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) becomes the primary suspect in a string of murders. I don't want to reveal any more about this case, but I will make it a point to praise Harner for not playing Northcott as a fanatical stereotype.Apparently, Straczynski inserted newspaper clippings into copies of his screenplay, just as a reminder to the actors that everything being depicted actually happened. ""The story is just so bizarre,"" he said, ""that you need something to remind you that I'm not making this stuff up."" Indeed, a lot of what Collins goes through is so outrageous that it's just shy of being funny. She knows, for example, how tall Walter is, for she measured his rate of growth on a wall. The boy who was returned to her is three inches shorter than the last notch. Collins also notices that this boy has been circumcised; she knows for a fact that Walter has not been. A doctor sent by Captain Jones assures Collins that, after months of improper care and nutrition, children can actually shrink. As for the circumcision, well, she should never put it past a kidnapper to do something extreme.But what about the LAPD? Should she put it past them to do something extreme, such as returning the wrong child and knowing about it? It's easy to watch this movie and feel just as emotionally drained as Collins; there are moments where I wanted to scream, others where I wanted to cry, and many where I didn't know how to feel. This is not a criticism. The success of a movie like ""Changeling"" depends on a strong emotional gamut that reflects what the audience thinks and feels. This is, without a doubt, one of the year's best films, a powerful human drama dedicated to the ideals of hope and perseverance.",5,A Mother Knows,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,5423,"['Clint',

But at the same time it's so hard not to review because of what an outstanding movie this turned out to be. I had a small amount of information on The Changeling before watching it. I knew that being directed by Clint Eastwood it had to be good or even great. He is a wonderful and talented director and has a vision for capturing the realism of life in a film. I was a little skeptical about Angelina Jolie being the main character. She gave a solid performance and had my heart aching for her the entire time. Some individuals say that they were sick of her crying in the movie and that she wasn't emotional enough to make them believe she had just lost her son. I do have to make a quick comment on that. First of all this was based in the 1920's when women had pretty much no say in the real world at all. They were made to show no emotion and pretty much keep their mouth shut at all times. So I think Angelina did superb at playing a 1920's mother. And yes she cried a lot, but tell me what mother wouldn't cry all the time if their son got kidnapped. Some of the pungent remarks people made are just so ridiculous and absurd that I had to say something to defend the film. I know everyone has their own opinion but atleast know what you're talking about when you put down a movie. The story telling was the most amazing part. Being based on a true story it is hard to imagine our world being so full of corruption and monstrous human beings. Everyone in the film played their part very well. And of course Clint Eastwood did outstanding as a director. The only thing lacking was how little you get to see the mother bonding with her child in the beginning. It's hard to fathom how strong their bond really was when you never get to see it happen for yourself. I know it may seem like a small problem and that I am just picking at the film. But that's not the case I love the movie. The problem is actually kind of big when the whole story is based on a mothers love for her child. We know that she loves her son very much, it just would have made the film have an even more powerful effect to see the process happen.This is based on a true story of a mother in the 1920's desperate to find her son when he goes missing one evening. Can she survive the antagonistic police force while still clinging on to hope for her son?. In this gripping tale you find out the true bond a mother has for her son by the extensive lengths she will go through for him and how strong a woman can really be when she is faced with more than a few horrible challenges. How never giving up can be one of the hardest things in life to face.The Changeling will have a strong hold on your heart and soul the entire way through. It is more than sad and yet happiness somehow seems to prevail. I highly recommend this as a must see film for the people that like dramatic, horror, great acting, well directed and well written movies.",4,Once Upon A Time In Real Life.....,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,3020,"['particular', 'film', 'hard', 'review', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'hard', 'not', 'review', 'what', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'had', 'small', 'amount', 'information', 'Changeling', 'watching', 'knew', 'being', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'had', 'be', 'good', 'even', 'great', 'wonderful', 'talented', 'director', 'vision', 'capturing', 'realism', 'life', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'being', 'main', 'character', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'had', 'heart', 'aching', 'entire', 'time', 'individuals', 'say', 'were', 'sick', 'crying', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'emotional', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'son', 'do', 'have', 'make', 'quick', 'comment', 'First', 'was', 'based', '1920', 'when', 'women', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'say', 'real', 'world', 'were', 'made', 'show', 'emotion', 'pretty', 'much', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'times', 'think', 'Angelina', 'did', 'superb', 'playing', '1920', 'mother', 'yes', 'cried', 'lot', 'tell', 'what', 'mother', 'would', ""n't"", 'cry', 'time', 'son', 'got', 'kidnapped', 'pungent', 'remarks', 'people', 'made', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'absurd', 'had', 'say', 'something', 'defend', 'film', 'know', 'everyone', 'own', 'opinion', 'atleast', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'when', 'put', 'down', 'movie', 'story', 'telling', 'was', 'most', 'amazing', 'part', 'Being', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'hard', 'imagine', 'world', 'being', 'full', 'corruption', 'monstrous', 'human', 'beings', 'Everyone', 'film', 'played', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'course', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'did', 'outstanding', 'director', 'only', 'thing', 'lacking', 'was', 'how', 'little', 'get', 'see', 'mother', 'bonding', 'child', 'beginning', 'hard', 'fathom', 'how', 'strong', 'bond', 'really', 'was', 'when', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'happen', 'know', 'may', 'seem', 'small', 'problem', 'am', 'just', 'picking', 'film', 'not', 'case', 'love', 'movie', 'problem', 'actually', 'kind', 'big', 'when', 'whole', 'story', 'based', 'mothers', 'love', 'child', 'know', 'son', 'very', 'much', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'have', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'effect', 'see', 'process', 'happen.This', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'mother', '1920', 'desperate', 'find', 'son', 'when', 'missing', 'one', 'evening', 'Can', 'survive', 'antagonistic', 'police', 'force', 'still', 'clinging', 'hope', 'son', 'gripping', 'tale', 'find', 'out', 'true', 'bond', 'mother', 'son', 'extensive', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'how', 'strong', 'woman', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'when', 'faced', 'more', 'few', 'horrible', 'challenges', 'How', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'hardest', 'things', 'life', 'face.The', 'Changeling', 'will', 'have', 'strong', 'hold', 'heart', 'soul', 'entire', 'way', 'more', 'sad', 'yet', 'happiness', 'somehow', 'prevail', 'highly', 'recommend', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'people', 'dramatic', 'horror', 'great', 'acting', 'well', 'directed', 'well', 'written', 'movies']",Changeling Theatrical Release

In 1928 Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) fears that her son Walter has been abducted when she returns home from work and finds that he is missing. She is desperate and diligently does her best to find him. Five months later the police do find a boy who claims that he is Walter. But when Christine sees this boy she states that he is not Walter.I had (mistakenly) thought since the film's release and after all the related publicity that this movie is built on a no-brainer concept, even though I knew that it is based on a true story.  I mean, a mother KNOWS who her nine-year-old son is. We are not talking mixing up babies at the hospital. So, I had little interest in it.Well, I just watched the film. I can't conceive of anyone playing the Christine Collins role more effectively than Jolie. What a performance! A gripping tale unfolds about the mistreatment Christine received at the hands of a corrupt Los Angeles Police Department. The story of Walter's probable fate is emotionally devastating. As the credits rolled I felt stunned as I tried to sort through it all.One reason I finally watched the film is Clint Eastwood's direction.

1158835,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00188M5TM,DanD,"[2, 2]","In Clint Eastwood's career timeline, 2008 will be known as the year of GRAN TORINO (the year the film was first released; it was a mere twist of fate it started becoming so popular after the turn of the year).  TORINO is indeed a great film, perhaps one of Eastwood's career highs; however, THE CHANGELING is also a fine film, deserving of all the accolades it has and should have acquired.The film tells the true tale of a mother's search for her missing son, and the police corruption that prevents her from seeking justice.  Months after her son's disappearance, Christine Collins is notified by the police that they have found him.  The only problem: He's not her son.  However, she is the only one who believes that; or, rather, the police refuse to admit they made a mistake.The corruption of the LAPD in the 1930s has been fodder for a lot of films; it's interesting to see Eastwood's take on it.  The shooting and score are glorious; the direction is well-handled, masterful.  No one doubts Eastwood knows exactly what he is doing.  The supporting actors are all well cast: John Malkovich as a radio preacher who has taken it upon himself to battle police corruption; Jason Butler Harner as an insane murderer; Amy Ryan as a sympathetic patient in a mental institution; Michael Kelly as perhaps one of the few honest cops on the LAPD's roster; Jeffrey Donovan as a menacing detective; and pretty much everybody else.  There are a lot of small roles scattered throughout the film; the focus is, of course, upon Angelina Jolie, who well deserves her Best Actress nomination (and if it weren't for Meryl Streep, she'd be a shoe-in for a win).  Jolie manages to hold the film together, as it meanders here and there (I'm willing to argue that the last forty-five minutes aren't necessary; they provide for some compelling scenes, but wouldn't be missed from the overall structure or story).  Jolie is the anchor here, along with Eastwood's steady direction, and together they have crafted a fine film about honesty, integrity, and a mother's devotion.",5,Clint Eastwood's other 2008 masterpiece.,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,2055,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'timeline', '2008', 'will', 'be', 'known', 'year', 'GRAN', 'TORINO', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'mere', 'twist', 'fate', 'started', 'becoming', 'so', 'popular', 'turn', 'year', 'TORINO', 'indeed', 'great', 'film', 'perhaps', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'highs', 'however', 'THE', 'CHANGELING', 'also', 'fine', 'film', 'deserving', 'accolades', 'should', 'have', 'acquired.The', 'film', 'true', 'tale', 'mother', 'search', 'missing', 'son', 'police', 'corruption', 'seeking', 'justice', 'Months', 'son', 'disappearance', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'notified', 'police', 'have', 'found', 'only', 'problem', 'not', 'son', 'However', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'rather', 'police', 'refuse', 'admit', 'made', 'mistake.The', 'corruption', 'LAPD', '1930s', 'been', 'fodder', 'lot', 'films', 'interesting', 'see', 'Eastwood', 'take', 'shooting', 'score', 'are', 'glorious', 'direction', 'well-handled', 'masterful', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'radio', 'preacher', 'who', 'taken', 'battle', 'police', 'corruption', 'Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'insane', 'murderer', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'sympathetic', 'patient', 'mental', 'institution', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'perhaps', 'one', 'few', 'honest', 'cops', 'LAPD', 'roster', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'menacing', 'detective', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'else', 'are', 'lot', 'small', 'roles', 'scattered', 'film', 'focus', 'course', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'well', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'were', ""n't"", 'Meryl', 'Streep', ""'d"", 'be', 'shoe-in', 'win', 'Jolie', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'here', 'there', ""'m"", 'willing', 'argue', 'last', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'provide', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'overall', 'structure', 'story', 'Jolie', 'anchor', 'here', 'Eastwood', 'steady', 'direction', 'together', 'have', 'crafted', 'fine', 'film', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'mother', 'devotion']",Changeling Theatrical Release

Angelina Jolie is absolute perfection in the role as a mother. The rest of the cast is so perfect, everyone plays their roles to perfection - including the children.There were two moments in the film where this viewer almost suspended belief in the film. Two very simple questions could have been asked, and most of the story would not have happened. However, it's important to remember that this film is based on a real story. Those two moments (one at the train station and the second at the police station) must have not happened for some reason. From there, every single moment of this film is believeable.The cast is remarkable. Angelina Jolie transforms through this film, from a calm mother that loves her son, to a frantic mother looking for her missing son, and then the calm and confidence at the end of the film. She is a force to watch. Jeffery Donovan (Burn Notice) is perfection as the police captain ready to do anything, and Christine Collin's nemisis. John Malkovich loses the crazies he's had lately (especially Burn After Reading), and proves that he is an amazing actor. Michael Kelly (Sopranos and Law and Order) is the quiet kind police officer that uncovers the farm. Dennis O'Hare (Law and Order, CSI, and Brothers and Sisters) is piercing as the head doctor in the asylum. Peter Gerety (Law and Order Judge and Homicide Life On The Street) finally moves out of his roles as judge to be a single minded doctor falsly identifying Christine as insane. The cast is deep, and many. The performances are all splendid.At 2 hours and 20 minutes, this film seemed like it would be too long. But in fact it is exactly the right length. The story moves along at a deliberate pace, it builds gradually through the search for Walter Collins. And the story resolves itself at exactly the right moment, with perfect speed and book end to absorb all that happened. The time goes by very quickly.Clint Eastwood is beginning to look like a very good director. Million Dollar Baby and Letters From Iwo Jima show his growing skills. He has managed to get some really fine performances across the entire cast of Changeling.Sound was used very carefully. The surround effects were kept to a minimum. One startling moment when the rear channels light up, is in the prison, adding intensity to the moment. Otherwise this is a dialog heavy film. The dynamic range on the dialog is really huge. There are moments so quiet it's almost impossible to hear, these are then followed by very loud dialog.Camera work, focus and exposure were virtually perfect throughout the film.The DVD contains two featurette pieces about Angelina Jolie becoming Christine, and another about Clint Eastwood making the film. Frankly after a film this moving, bonus features are really not necessary.This is definately an R rated film. There are two moments with electroshock therapy I'm not sure most can endure, the fast forward button is a good friend (there's plenty of warning, just remember room 18). The story is just so difficult that anyone under 17 is probably not well equipped for this film, or they would have to be an extremely mature child. There is a very brief moment of nudity, and there is a bit of language.I was very hesitant to watch this film. My wife and I decided one evening to watch this. We are both very glad we watched this.

Michael StraczynskiDirector- Clint EastwoodStarring- Angelina Jolie, Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly, Colm Feore and John Malkovich as Gustav BrieglebThere's no doubt that Clint Eastwood is a Hollywood Icon from his work as an actor and as a producer and director. From the crime/drama genre to the western Eastwood has set the par time and time again. Even in his late 70s Eastwood is showing no signs of slowing down as he's been busy directing movie after movie and Changeling easily rates as one of his very best movies to date; I might give the edge to Million Dollar Baby, but Changeling is another classic in film in the brilliant career of Clint Eastwood.Changeling is a movie that manages to grip you from the start and never let go. This was one of the very best pictures of 2008 and I'm quite surprised it didn't get a best picture nomination or director for that matter. The Academy loves to nominate Eastwood every chance they get and I thought for sure he'd get one here, which in my opinion he was very deserving of as well as the movie.The screenplay by J. Michael Straczynski was terrific; the script is very well written and deep and dramatic and hits all the right spots. This screenplay can serve as a course on how to structure a great screenplay. My only complaint is I would have liked more scenes with mother and son before he goes missing. Obviously there is a bond, but I would have liked to have seen a little more there; but regardless J. Michael Straczynski writes a truly memorable screenplay.As director Clint Eastwood crafts a masterpiece of filmmaking; despite the 141-minute running time Changeling is always moving forward in terms of plot and characters and the pacing never once drags, but I do feel the movie went on a little longer than it needed to, but the scenes never felt tacked or like filler scenes. Clint Eastwood knows cinema more than most and he knows how to make an enjoyable movie and a great movie. I suppose the more movies you make you're bound to miss from time to time, but in general Eastwood has always been on target except for maybe with the Rookie. Here though with Changeling, Eastwood makes one of the best movies of his career and most filmmakers as they get older seem to lose their touch, but Clint is an exception. Eastwood crafts some powerful and dramatic scenes that will stick with the viewer. How he didn't get nominated for this is beyond me.All the performances are excellent; Angelina Jolie as Christine Collins delivers a performance of a lifetime. Her character was sympathetic and brave and the performance was truly inspirational. Jolie was very deserving of her Oscar nomination for Changeling. I like Angelina Jolie, but I'm not a huge fan, but this easily rates as one of my favorite performances. Jeffrey Donovan is also excellent in his role as Capt. J.J. Jones. John Malkovich as Gustav Briegleb is simply amazing; Malkovich is a fine actor and here he delivers one of his finest performances.I highly recommend Changeling; the movie is powerful and dramatic and gripping; everything you could ask for in a movie is here and no doubt it's one of the finest of 2008.The Blu-ray has an amazing transfer and excellent sound.

1158839,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B00188M5TM,Davewise,"[3, 3]","After seeing this movie I was struck most by two things: Angelina Jolie is a great actress and it's a terrible tragedy what happened to the woman whom she portrays in this movie. I don't know what percentage of the movie is accurate, but the fact it is based on a true story is disturbing. While there are some moments of hope, much of the movie tends to be gut-wrenching. If you like really good dramas which give a realistic depiction of a person's hardships and struggles, give this movie a try. By the end I really felt for the mother at the center of the story.It wasn't bad enough that Christine Collins (the single mother portrayed by Jolie) had her only son Walter abducted, the police went and made things ten times worse. The corrupt Los Angeles police department in the 1920s already had a bad reputation so some officials did anything they thought might prevent further embarrassment. They claimed to have found Walter and reunited him with his mother; however, as soon as Christine saw the boy, she said it wasn't her son. The police chief coerced her into taking the boy home and ignored her continued pleas for help with finding her real son. The chief insisted the boy was Walter despite physical evidence to the contrary. When Christine, with the help of a local minister (played by John Malkovich), starts to make trouble for the police, the chief has her put away in an asylum, declaring her crazy. Only after the uncovering of a serial killer and a gruesome crime scene are the police forced to confront the issue again. Even with the discovery, many questions remain.Hearing the screenplay was written by J. Michael Straczynski, whose sci-fi series ""Babylon 5"" is among my favorites, I was curious how his dramatic work would be and found it was impressive. His writing did justice to the story, evoking sympathy and keeping you guessing throughout. Clint Eastwood is a wonderful director and had a quality cast to work with that also included Amy Ryan as a prostitute who was another victim of the police department. The highlight though is Jolie who gives a truly heartfelt performance. After seeing this, one can easily make an argument she deserved an Oscar.",5,A mother's nightmare,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,2183,"['seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'struck', 'most', 'two', 'things', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'great', 'actress', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'what', 'happened', 'woman', 'whom', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'percentage', 'movie', 'accurate', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'disturbing', 'are', 'moments', 'hope', 'much', 'movie', 'be', 'gut-wrenching', 'like', 'really', 'good', 'dramas', 'give', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'person', 'hardships', 'struggles', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'end', 'really', 'felt', 'mother', 'center', 'story.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'single', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'Jolie', 'had', 'only', 'son', 'Walter', 'abducted', 'police', 'went', 'made', 'things', 'ten', 'times', 'worse', 'corrupt', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'police', 'department', '1920s', 'already', 'had', 'bad', 'reputation', 'officials', 'did', 'anything', 'thought', 'might', 'prevent', 'further', 'embarrassment', 'claimed', 'have', 'found', 'Walter', 'reunited', 'mother', 'however', 'as', 'soon', 'Christine', 'saw', 'boy', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'son', 'police', 'chief', 'coerced', 'taking', 'boy', 'home', 'ignored', 'continued', 'pleas', 'help', 'finding', 'real', 'son', 'chief', 'insisted', 'boy', 'was', 'Walter', 'physical', 'evidence', 'contrary', 'When', 'Christine', 'help', 'local', 'minister', 'played', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'make', 'trouble', 'police', 'chief', 'put', 'away', 'asylum', 'declaring', 'crazy', 'Only', 'uncovering', 'serial', 'killer', 'gruesome', 'crime', 'scene', 'are', 'police', 'forced', 'confront', 'issue', 'again', 'Even', 'discovery', 'many', 'questions', 'remain.Hearing', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'Babylon', '5', 'favorites', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'dramatic', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'was', 'impressive', 'writing', 'did', 'justice', 'story', 'evoking', 'sympathy', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'wonderful', 'director', 'had', 'quality', 'cast', 'work', 'also', 'included', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'prostitute', 'who', 'was', 'victim', 'police', 'department', 'highlight', 'though', 'Jolie', 'who', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'seeing', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'make', 'argument', 'deserved', 'Oscar']",Changeling Theatrical Release
1158840,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00188M5TM,David A. Wend,"[5, 8]","I was not sure that I wanted to see The Changeling. Having seen the trailers a few times I was not looking forward to seeing the film. When my wife and I did go I was a bit bored by the story since I knew what was coming.But as I watched more I became caught up in the story as it became more and more unbelievable. I was left wondering why the story of Christine Collins and her son had not been told before.  The film is very close to the real events that to us would be abuses of power that could only happen in third world countries.  As was related in LA Confidential, the Los Angeles Police force was a formidable crime organization but that they could have someone committed to a mental institution - without evidence or due process - is a stunning abuse of power.The performance by Angelina Jolie is amazing. She became Christine Collins and the emotion she brings to her role was never over played.  Simple put she acts as a mother would and her character is required to carry the film, which she does admirably. It was great seeing John Malkovich in a part that was not sinister. He is the Presbyterian minister Gustav Briegleb, who is perhaps the only person the LAPD fears for his radio sermons and the corruption they expose.Jason Butler Harner is fantastic as Gordon Northcott, who is the suspect in what came to be termed as the Chicken Coop Murders.  Mr. Harner played his part as someone who was profoundly mentally disturbed, entirely divorced from reality. The story of the Wineville murders would make a movie in itself.  Eddie Anderson is outstanding as Sanford Clark, the boy who confessed to helping his cousin (Gordon Northcott).  His scene where he confesses to the murders was remarkable for his depth of emotion and when forced by the dubious detective to dig up the remains of the victims his display of revulsion with precisely what his part demanded.As for the villains, Colm Feore played the Chief of Police memorably and Jeffrey Donovan is equally good as the amoral and domineering Captain J.J Jones.  The scenes where he bullies Christine Collins are difficult to watch without wanting to scream back at the screen in protest.  I have not had this kind of involvement with a movie in a long time. Michael Kelly was every inch the police detective as Lester Ybarra, especially memorable was the scene when he decided to give Sanford Clark the benefit of the doubt about his story of the murders.My wife found The Changeling too long but I became so caught up in the story that time was not a factor. I think the criticism that I have read about this movie - that it is not mysterious enough and is confusing - miss the mark.  It is not an easy film to watch with the gross injustice committed against Christine Collins to say nothing of the length of the film (141 minutes).  There is a lot of story to relate between the story of Christine Collins and the murders but Clint Eastwood manages to weave together as a single story.The Changeling brings to life the late 1920's where women's rights have a long way to go, to even become supervisors, and where the police serve their own needs and not those of the community.  Clint Eastwood has put together a remarkable film that will not be appreciated right away: he has shed light on a crime that was never solved and a mother who was never reunited with her son. The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery to this day.",5,Thought Provoking Filmmaking,1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,3404,"['was', 'not', 'sure', 'wanted', 'see', 'Changeling', 'Having', 'seen', 'trailers', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'When', 'wife', 'did', 'go', 'was', 'bit', 'bored', 'story', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming.But', 'watched', 'more', 'became', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'story', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'son', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'film', 'very', 'close', 'real', 'events', 'would', 'be', 'abuses', 'power', 'could', 'only', 'happen', 'third', 'world', 'countries', 'was', 'related', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'force', 'was', 'formidable', 'crime', 'organization', 'could', 'have', 'someone', 'committed', 'mental', 'institution', 'evidence', 'due', 'process', 'stunning', 'abuse', 'power.The', 'performance', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'amazing', 'became', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'emotion', 'role', 'was', 'never', 'played', 'Simple', 'put', 'mother', 'would', 'character', 'required', 'carry', 'film', 'admirably', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'sinister', 'Presbyterian', 'minister', 'Gustav', 'Briegleb', 'who', 'perhaps', 'only', 'person', 'LAPD', 'fears', 'radio', 'sermons', 'corruption', 'expose.Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'fantastic', 'Gordon', 'Northcott', 'who', 'suspect', 'what', 'came', 'be', 'termed', 'Chicken', 'Coop', 'Murders', 'Mr.', 'Harner', 'played', 'part', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'profoundly', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'entirely', 'divorced', 'reality', 'story', 'Wineville', 'murders', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'Eddie', 'Anderson', 'outstanding', 'Sanford', 'Clark', 'boy', 'who', 'confessed', 'helping', 'cousin', 'Gordon', 'Northcott', 'scene', 'where', 'murders', 'was', 'remarkable', 'depth', 'emotion', 'when', 'forced', 'dubious', 'detective', 'dig', 'up', 'remains', 'victims', 'display', 'revulsion', 'precisely', 'what', 'part', 'demanded.As', 'villains', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'played', 'Chief', 'Police', 'memorably', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'equally', 'good', 'amoral', 'domineering', 'Captain', 'J.J', 'Jones', 'scenes', 'where', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'are', 'difficult', 'watch', 'wanting', 'scream', 'back', 'screen', 'protest', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'kind', 'involvement', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'was', 'inch', 'police', 'detective', 'Lester', 'Ybarra', 'especially', 'memorable', 'was', 'scene', 'when', 'decided', 'give', 'Sanford', 'Clark', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'story', 'murders.My', 'wife', 'found', 'Changeling', 'too', 'long', 'became', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'factor', 'think', 'criticism', 'have', 'read', 'movie', 'not', 'mysterious', 'enough', 'confusing', 'miss', 'mark', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'gross', 'injustice', 'committed', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'say', 'nothing', 'length', 'film', '141', 'minutes', 'lot', 'story', 'relate', 'story', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'murders', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'weave', 'together', 'single', 'story.The', 'Changeling', 'life', 'late', '1920', 'where', 'women', 'rights', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'even', 'become', 'supervisors', 'where', 'police', 'serve', 'own', 'needs', 'not', 'community', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'put', 'together', 'remarkable', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'appreciated', 'right', 'away', 'shed', 'light', 'crime', 'was', 'never', 'solved', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'reunited', 'son', 'fate', 'Walter', 'Collins', 'mystery', 'day']",Changeling Theatrical Release

1158846,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B00188M5TM,Dexter Manning,"[4, 17]","""Changeling,"" the latest endeavor from director Clint Eastwood, is not only about the ordeal a loving mother, played with determined passion by Angelina Jolie, suffers after her young boy (Gattlin Griffith) goes missing, and the unusual lengths she must go to recover him, particularly after the Los Angeles Police Department closes the case after uniting her with a boy who does not appear to actually be her own. It is also about the lengths people in power will go to preserve that power and their prestige. In the real world, outside of movies, we live in one of the eras in which citizens throughout the US are as distrustful as ever of those with power and influence and this film can be taken to also symbolize a kind of indictment of such people and the abuse of that power.Indeed, almost everything within the film is calculated to hit extra hard at our emotional chords, to tug our heartstrings in support of the heroine, fill us with rage and disgust at the sight of the actions of the powerful leaders in the story, and, of course, jerk the tears from eyes. Eastwood's more recent films in particular are known to contain some sentimentality but, until now, he's refrained from hitting us over the head with the overexuberant brand of saccharin, meritless emotion found in many other films based on real-life accounts of peril and injustice. Yet, that is a particular test ""Changeling"" does not quite pass, though it is still far above some of the biggest and worst weepies in the room (""Tsotsi,"" anyone? Or, perhaps you would prefer shedding tears to ""Central Station""?).Part of the problem is the way the central character is portrayed, not entirely due to Jolie's work, but also to the fact that she, and as such her character, comes across as rather too glamorous for the predicaments she finds herself in. Even during the most trying scenes, such as searching frantically for her missing son, dealing with a police department that is, at best, apathetic and, at worst, one of the chief causes of grief Christine Collins (Jolie) and the audience are made to suffer, she seems oddly beautiful in a way that leaves a disconnect, to the detriment of any realism the movie may have otherwise had, with the drama that unfolds.As was the case in last year's ""A Mighty Heart,"" in which the actress delivers another impassioned performance as a woman who is, in many ways, in a similar situation--tragically wronged by circumstances and people beyond her control--it is often difficult to see past her movie-star glitter to get to the raw agony at the core of her character. A large part of this has to do with how the film visually presents her. Her hair and makeup are just right enough to flatter her, even during her most trying times within a grim psychiatric ward, many of the patients of which arrived unwillingly mainly because they were an inconvenience to the police and others in power. She is always filmed by the director of photography, Tom Stern, to look beautiful, almost saintly. That's not a criticism of his work in the film generally; it appropriately renders a vivid interpretation of a 1920s Los Angeles reminiscent of old Hollywood pictures. However, it does distract from Jolie.I don't know if Jolie plans to take on similar roles in other films like this any time soon, but if she does it would be best for all involved if she transforms herself according to the demands of her character--with the help, whenever necessary, of the filmmakers. Too many of her performances feel adequate but also seem as if they could have been more profound than they were.The other actors in this movie--and, consequently, their characters--suffer less from the glamour effect. John Malkovich, as Rev. Gustav Briegleb, who adopts Collins' search for the truth as his own mission--and, by extension, that of his church--infuses a more fiery brand of righteous indignity into the story, in case that of Collins herself, along with the situations that develop in the course of the story, don't make you angry enough.In terms of emotional depth, many of the police and those associated with them are not much more than cardboard cutouts, especially compared to Jolie's palpable emotions. Jeffrey Donovan is Captain J. J. Jones, Collins' main contact at the LAPD who, when questioned about the identity of the boy given to her in a highly-public photo-op, steadfastly dismisses the notion that he and his unquestioningly proud colleagues, in their quest to quickly pacify the mother, may have made mistakes, and, when confronted with the fact such mistakes were made, declares Collins insane, ordering her sent to an asylum against her will. Colm Feore is chief of police James E. Davis, Jones' boss who is determined to keep the corrupt department in the best light, at least until Mayor Cryer (Reed Birney) wins his reelection bid. Dr Jonathan Steele is the head of a psychiatry ward that owes its allegiance completely to the police department. He is played by Denis O'Hare in a way that banishes any trace of humanity from the character and fills the void with nothing but contempt. The main exception to the overwhelmingly mean and callous police team turns out to be Michael Kelly as Det. Lester Ybarra, who makes an important discovery during the course of the Collins case.Other key characters include Carol Dexter (Amy Ryan, edgy, moving, real and, as usual, unpretentious--a good example to follow), a woman who befriends Collins at the psychiatry ward; and those played by Colby French, Eddie Alderson, and Devon Conti.The movie is obviously being pushed for the Oscars, especially for Jolie. There's even a scene in which Collins listens to the Academy Awards broadcast. It's an exercise in naval-gazing, and it is rather irritating when filmmakers place marketing campaigns for Oscars within the very films for which they would like an award. It's worse than product placement. On the other hand, due to the lighthearted nature of the scene and the fact that it occurs late in a film that is unrelentingly heavy both before and afterward, the scene could also be seen as comedy relief, a welcome respite from nonstop drama; but the same effect could have been achieved without so blatantly screaming for an Oscar nomination.Despite the objections, the film is by no means ruined by the glamour and the oversentimentality. Rather, these are mainly a distraction from what is otherwise a compelling and memorable story, written by J. Michael Straczynski, otherwise told relatively well. The basic story is perhaps the best thing about the film, more likely than not because it it presents an inherently compelling situation. The way scenes are intricately intercut (by editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach) so as to play off each other is an old tool of storytelling that is used to good effect here, though more for dramatic effect than as an essential method of conveying the plot. Overall, the film could have been more efficient, with a few minutes being trimmed from the film, most obviously the aforementioned Oscar scene. Also, some sequences do feel repetitious in plot and especially in the emotions evoked.In the end, while ""Changeling"" is an engrossing story, its distractions interfere with the film, rendering it far from perfect, and, ultimately, minor Eastwood.",3,Changeling: A Review.,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,7297,"['Changeling', 'latest', 'endeavor', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'only',

1158847,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00188M5TM,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[0, 3]","In his 2008 film ""Changeling"", director Clint Eastwood presents a ghoulishly and somberly hued portrait of a flapper-era City of Angels that keeps his audience white-knuckled and frequently aghast at yet another chronicled onslaught against basic human decency.  Revisiting themes of corrupt misused power, an overall erosion of values and the resulting injustice against the innocent that he has explored in films like `Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)' and ""Unforgiven,"" Eastwood creates a microcosm of a larger failed system by focusing on a sad chapter in LA history that revolves around the kidnapping of a young boy.  Eastwood interjects a more brutal reality to the already horrendous events that transpired when single mother Christine Collins, a telephone operator supervisor, (a bruised-eyed and ruby-red-rouged lipped Angelina Jolie) discovers that her son, Walter, is missing.  The already press-beleaguered police become involved albeit condescendingly,--Jefferey Donovan's performance as the snaky police captain in charge ruthlessly epitomizes how heady a cocktail of pressure from above mixed with the brain swell of power can be--producing another boy in lieu of the missing Walter just to give press closure to the case.  When Christine repeatedly insists that the found boy is not her son, she is instantly dismissed as an incompetent, irresponsible mother who during the months the child was missing supposedly became too accustomed to her newfound freedom.  The police captain rounds up a group of expert doctors to further his cause and to add insult to injury to this all too true bureaucratic straight-jacket in which Christine finds herself bound.Eastwood drives the film with all the lead-footed ferocity of a Mack Truck crazy with speed.  Christine's role as single working mother transmutes to that of emerging female individualist who by reason of her gender is either considered as a trespasser on male employment territory or a hysterical troublemaker requiring sedation to be kept under authority respecting control. As one of the little people who takes responsibility seriously, paying her civic and societal dues with a happy sense of regularity and accomplishment, she discovers that instead of the steadfastness and support she expects from a system for which she has bolstered and paid she receives more than just a negative dividend along with the remnants of her middle class ideals.  Her understanding of this reaches a grizzly climax in a bleak cruelly run hospital for the insane and for women that have been incarcerated by the police under the insidious no-questions-asked Code 12.Barring lobotomy, Eastwood pushes all this white-coated terror to the limit--masochistic hospital staff wielding water hoses and administering humiliation-inducing syphilis tests leads to no-win double-talking analysis sessions with sadistic doctors, unnecessary sedatives and the ultimateOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Penguin Classics)depravity, electric shock treatment.  Phew! I had to shut my eyes more than once--all that white Gothic starchiness induced a snow-blindness I felt like a kick in the gut.Meanwhile back at the ranch--and what a ranch--in what was once called Wineville in Riverside County--the only ethical representative of the Los Angeles police department investigates a tip regarding the deportation of a minor to Canada and discovers the horrific murder factory of child-killer Gordon Northcott.  Here Eastwood steps heavily on the brakes of what up until then had been a fast-moving almost out of control vehicle depicting every depraved manner of humiliation conceivable directed at controlling the drones of the middle class.  This break in the action at first seems like the eye of a hurricane, however the film although brutal in its scenes of child killing and capital punishment never hits the mark again as it does in the first ninety minutes.Angelina does the role of Christine justice.  Visually beautiful she relentlessly acts up a storm with just a residual hint of some of her former revenge minded characters (think the scary cold-hearted assassin Fox in ""Wanted (Two-Disc Special Edition)"") to remind the audience that this is still Jolie that it is watching.  John Malkovich plays the helpful radio-minister, Gustav Briegleb, with his usual adept precision while most of the other characters formulate a body of different archetypical stereotypes that are frightening in their bleak presentation.Bottom line?  Clint Eastwood's Changeling is fraught with a disturbing energy that bombards the viewer with a stereoscope of images from another era that suggests being back in the day is no better than being around now.  Depicting institutions that supposedly are designed to support and enrich the public as greedy citadels of misused power sadly reminds us of our faith in financial institutions that betray rather than pave the way for responsibly planned middle class futures.  Recommended with the warning of many brutally depicted scenes of inhumanity towards the insane, child abduction and killing, and capital punishment. Eastwood chills with a razor-honed austerity that is a far cry from the sun-kissed star-studded celebrity of today's LA.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,"Systems, Interrupted",1225497600,"11 1,

Imagine that Clint and Ron got the red carpet treatment for a below par screenplay.  Ken Burns would have done a much better job but then less of an audience unless they exaggerate all the blood spilling, electric shock therapy, and evil looks of the protaganists.  I liked the skating at work deal, Angelina just has to keep pursing those SCREAMING TOMATOE RED lips that distract from anything else going on in the scene and if anyone considers her a feminist because she is forced to work and a minister pretty much takes up her case, I dunno, not buying it.  I think this entire genre of ""Where's my son/daughter/family member"" is not striking the chord as much as desired, LAPD is prolly worse now...justice served selectively, minorities treated poorly unless Gloria Allred is sleuthing nearby.  Quite frankly, a woman with 6 kids should be home taking care of her family and she is just the wrong talent for this vehicle of compassion for a parent.

I was wrong on the second count: There isn't one dull moment here. This is one of the few films to come out in the last decade or so that I think deserves at least minor classic status. Wonderful acting (especially by Jolie but by everyone else as well), a riveting yet well-paced and intelligent storyline. . . just a very fine film in every aspect.CHANGELING is frightening, provocative, and heartwarming all at once. One of the many things this story shows us is how a governmental/police bureaucracy can make the most innocent people seem guilty and the most sane people appear nuts.

1158851,A8WZ4YFQB77HC,B00188M5TM,"EddieLove ""EddieLove""","[10, 11]","Considering the critical reverence visited on each new Clint Eastwood film, it's odd how underrated this powerful film was.  A.O. Scott's review in The New York Times was particularly irksome, as it seemed more a review of Angelina's likely Oscar campaign than the film itself.  Perhaps the way this movie was advertised may have gotten people thinking it was Jolie giving an acting showcase in some modern day ""woman's picture"".  But, I'd liken this movie more to pictures like L.A. Confidential and Zodiac than to some kind of big screen Lifetime movie.  And I'd rate the movie higher than both Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, both fine films.  But I couldn't stop thinking about this film for days after seeing it.  It's Eastwood's most emotionally powerful film.Jolie is sensational in the lead, and I hate the notion that this is just some canned Oscar-bait.  Again, the ads made it look like she has these big ""acting"" outbursts.  In fact there's only two such moments, and they're so powerful when you know who she's shouting at.  She creates a heroic portrait of an independent woman of the period and she's not at all anachronistic.  Her hands flutter around her face, not as some histrionic mannerism, but because her character's struggling with her reticence amidst her nightmarish situation and her position in society in general.The film has an outstanding cast.  Jeffrey Donovan from Burn Notice and John Malkovich are both superb.  There are two actors I was unfamiliar with who play cop and killer and this film should propel them into major roles, they're both extraordinary.  There's also especially good work from the young boys in the cast.Also, social conservatives who always bash Hollywood, should take note of the film offering a heroic portrait of an American religious leader with Malkovich's role.I blanched at the running time on this, but it never lags.

It's all at once touching, infuriating,  empowering, and immensely compelling!!It's a true story and not just ""based"" on a true story. Collins refused to be silenced or ignored, and with the help of some key figures, she took on one of the most shameful cases of police corruption in Los Angeles history.Angelina Jolie gives a rivetting and stunning performance as Collins, an honest, caring woman who was clearly striving for independence in a male-dominated society. She works diligently as the supervisor for a telephone company, so much so that she's offered a managerial position.  As a single mother, she's firm yet nurturing, and she's upfront with her son.After her son Walter's disappearance, and after the wrong boy is returned to her, she initially faces the LAPD on her own, which leaves her with little since it's a tyrannical system motivated by lust for power, not justice.The authority figures in this film are by far the most deplorable. They are obstinate and domineering, bullying Collins into taking in an imposter child.  Frequently displaying the nerve to question Collins as a mother, claiming she was so happy her son was taken and that she's now resorting to phony accusations. Her insistence that they carry on the investigation lands her in a dehumanizing psychiatric hospital, where numerous strong-willed women labelled by the system as ""disruptive""  are sent to endure constant medicating, abuse and cruel electroshock therapy.The only person on Collins' side is Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a Presbyterian minister and community activist who made it his life's mission to expose the deep and widespread corruption of the L.A.P.D during radio sermons.When Collins was committed, Briegleb took it upon himself to publicize the disappearance of her son and rally the public to support her. This put tremendous pressure on the LAPD, as did the concurrent discovery of a crime scene; buried beneath a chicken ranch in Wineville, California are human remains. A mechanic named Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) becomes the primary suspect in a string of murders.Indeed, a lot of what Collins goes through is so outrageous that it's  deeply disturbing.

1158855,APL58EZDQX1N0,B00188M5TM,E Scott,"[1, 1]","Angelina Jolie is a credit to her profession. I have seen, owned, enjoyed several of Ms. Jolie's films on DVD -- but few more so than ""Changeling."" The film is, in short, a movie and a half. Director Clint Eastwood has given us a well-paced, disturbing (yet strangely uplifting), riveting picture here -- and his choice of Jolie in the lead could have been no better. She gives what one can only aptly call a truly tour-de-force performance here. The lady certainly deserved her Oscar nom for this film, and I'm sorry that ""Changeling"" did not make it as her 1st Best Actress win. In looking up that year's winner (2008), one can scarcely criticize Kate Winslet -- always superb as well -- so I'd not deny her what Academy voters considered a deserved win for ""The Reader."" But, I must tell you: Angelina Jolie is absolutely mind-bogglingly superb in ""Changeling."" Her performance is measured, often under-played (to great effect, I might add), and ultimately immensely powerful. One of the film's themes, per website Wikipedia, is female disempowerment. Well, same is a tough sell with Angie around. Her role as Christine Collins, mother to the suddenly-missing nine-year-old Walter, is anything but disempowered -- despite the all-powerful, disgustingly corrupt LAPD of 1928 and/or its fierce machinations. Why? Because Ms. Jolie, as Christine, endures it all -- and she truly is put through the mill here -- with suitable dignity, pride, strength, and a mother's fierce belief in her goal: the revelation of the truth and return of her missing son. Angelina Jolie (very properly dressed, coiffed, made-up and mannered for the period) is alternately intelligent, compelling, emotional -- while never hysterically so, unless due to completely understandable provocations -- motherly, tender and fierce. In short, she alone is perhaps the perfect match for the film's Machevalian LAPD. Several good performances here, to be sure (as well as an excellent script, despite a few unresolved holes, from which Eastwood could shoot so effectively), but ""Changeling"" is ultimately a one-woman show: the film belongs to Angelina Jolie; always compelling, worth watching and experiencing -- but, to date, never more so than in this marvelous, frustrating, distrurbing, yet well-worth-the-effort film.",5,WOW!,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,2291,"['Angelina', 'Jolie', 'credit', 'profession', 'have', 'seen', 'owned', 'enjoyed', 'several', 'Ms.', 'Jolie', 'films', 'DVD', 'few', 'more', 'so', 'Changeling', 'film', 'short', 'movie', 'half', 'Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'given', 'well-paced', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'strangely', 'uplifting', 'riveting', 'picture', 'here', 'choice', 'Jolie', 'lead', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'aptly', 'call', 'truly', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'here', 'lady', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'film', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Changeling', 'did', 'not', 'make', '1st', 'Best', 'Actress', 'win', 'looking', 'up', 'year', 'winner', '2008', 'one', 'can', 'scarcely', 'criticize', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'always', 'superb', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'not', 'deny', 'what', 'Academy', 'voters', 'considered', 'deserved', 'win', 'Reader', 'must', 'tell', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'absolutely', 'mind-bogglingly', 'superb', 'Changeling', 'performance', 'measured', 'often', 'under-played', 'great', 'effect', 'might', 'add', 'ultimately', 'immensely', 'powerful', 'One', 'film', 'themes', 'website', 'Wikipedia', 'female', 'disempowerment', 'Well', 'same', 'tough', 'sell', 'Angie', 'role', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'mother', 'suddenly-missing', 'nine-year-old', 'Walter', 'anything', 'disempowered', 'all-powerful', 'disgustingly', 'corrupt', 'LAPD', '1928', 'and/or', 'fierce', 'machinations', 'Why', 'Ms.', 'Jolie', 'Christine', 'truly', 'put', 'mill', 'here', 'suitable', 'dignity', 'pride', 'strength', 'mother', 'fierce', 'belief', 'goal', 'revelation', 'truth', 'return', 'missing', 'son', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'very', 'properly', 'dressed', 'coiffed', 'made-up', 'mannered', 'period', 'alternately', 'intelligent', 'compelling', 'emotional', 'never', 'hysterically', 'so', 'due', 'completely', 'understandable', 'provocations', 'motherly', 'tender', 'fierce', 'short', 'alone', 'perhaps', 'perfect', 'match', 'film', 'Machevalian', 'LAPD', 'Several', 'good', 'performances', 'here', 'be', 'sure', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'script', 'few', 'unresolved', 'holes', 'Eastwood', 'could', 'shoot', 'so', 'effectively', 'Changeling', 'ultimately', 'one-woman', 'show', 'film', 'belongs', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'always', 'compelling', 'worth', 'watching', 'experiencing', 'date', 'never', 'more', 'so', 'marvelous', 'frustrating', 'distrurbing', 'yet', 'well-worth-the-effort', 'film']",Changeling Theatrical Release

Also, the initial investigative scene had quite a breeze blowing, a common occurance in Mira Loma - we used to call the place ""windy gulch"".  Those who made the movie sure got those aspects correct.I found this to be a superb movie, with a good story line and excellent actors all the way through. It left me with a sense that we had better guard against city politics and any police departments such as Los Angeles endured during the 1920's and 1930's.

1158858,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00188M5TM,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[4, 4]","CHANGELINGI went into this film for only one reason and it had nothing to do with Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, or Angelina Jolie. I watched this for Jeffrey Donovan since I am a huge fan of his especially his show with Bruce Campbell ""Burn Notice"", possibly the best show on today. So I was excited to learn that he was in this and had a major role in it as well. Still with that a side every one involved with this film did an excellent job on this film, including to my surprise Jolie. I know that sounds bad but it really isn't but there will be more on that later, really there will be.I am sure that every one knows that this is a true story film based on some events that happened called the Wineville murders. The film is based on the man who did these things kidnapping and murdering little kids with his nephew in tow, that part is crazy. Any way along the way they take a boy named Walter Collins and naturally his mother goes crazy looking for him. After months of what I can only imagine as some of the worst pain possible his mother gets the news that her son has been found. When brought to the train station to reunite with him she is astonished when the kid turns out not to be hers, of course the LAPD disagrees with every word. From here the film is a chess match between Mama Collins and the police department, and it is one for the ages. When she refuses to believe that the child brought to her is her son the police with a snap of their fingers put her away in a mental hospital. I assure you that it only gets better from their, I promise.I have to say that J. Michael Straczynski did a wonderful job adapting the real story into a screenplay that ended up being a brilliant film. I know that it is hard to add all those words and events together especially when you were not there at all. Still I feel that this is very close to what happened and that is saying something. Same can be said for Director Clint Eastwood who once again creates another marvelous picture that got snubbed at the Oscars. This man keeps amazing me with the quality of the films he puts out, I can honestly say that I have enjoyed all of his films when he is behind the camera. You can tell the man has been in the business for a while because he knows how to tell a story. Two more guys that scored again are producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard who once again were apart of one of the best films of the year, they are known to do that from time to time. Sure most of there films end all happy and stuff but you have to admit that the films have been entertaining. While the director had a lot to do with making this a good movie a lot of credit needs to go to the DP Tom Stern who made this film look fantastic. With these people behind this film how could it not be good, the look and feel of this film is amazing.Acting wise this is a brilliant film and that includes the child actors, that is a rarity even on big budget flicks. Donovan naturally is excellent as Captain Jones of the LAPD, his smug portrayal of the real life man is superb. This is now the fourth or fifth film I have seen him in and like all of the others h gives an excellent performance. Jolie is amazing as well and really changed my mind about her, don't get me wrong I never really hated her but she just seemed like she could only pull off less demanding roles. But I am happy to admit that she did a wonderful job in the lead role and pulled off some very tense moments. John Malkovich as one would expect provides one of the films best performances as the overly paranoid [it seem for good reason] preacher who comes to the aid of Miss Walters. Jason Butler Harner provides maybe the best performance next to Donovan as the murderess Gordon Northcott. He pulls off a crazy performance here and his execution scene is unforgettable in my mind. Some have said that he plays it over the top but I really feel like he did a wonderful job with a difficult character.This was a wonderful film that I think was snubbed by the Academy but what ever, this film is great with out them. I recommend this flick to any and every one that enjoys a good movie. Normally I would say something like this may not be for every body but this time I will say, every body go get this.

1158860,AY12DBB0U420B,B00188M5TM,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Changeling"" staring Angelina Jolie and directed by Clint Eastwood. The movie was loosely based on a true kidnapping and murder case coming out of Los Angeles in the mid-1920s. As such, I found this period piece to be just amazing. The film was date-marked from place to place from the mid-20s to the mid-30s and the scenery always fit the time. How do they ever do it? Where do they get all those magnificent old cars and  trucks? Where do they get Los Angeles street-rail cars and even the rails on the streets to operate them?And how do they get rid of all the normal traffic and people? I could go on and on. It's amazing! Kudos to those in charge of the sets!The story had a powerful impact on me. I might indicate that I'm the father of a 4 1/2-year-old boy and this story would be a parent's worst nightmare. I thought that it lacked credibility here and there. Okay, a young boy was kidnapped and gone for six months. Then the police said they found him in a mid-west state and shipped him back to Los Angeles. Well, Jolie took one look and knew it wasn't her boy. What parent wouldn't? I mean, he was three inches shorter than her boy, he was circumcised and her boy wasn't and there were all sorts of other things that just didn't fit. Yet, the story goes on and she's locked up in a mental ward for disagreeing with the police identification. Really? Can this kind of incompetence and/or total corruption really happen? Well, surely not in this  day and age.Then, of course, they finally find a chicken ranch where about 20 boys were murdered. The killer is caught, tried, sentenced and, ultimately hanged for the murders. It's a gripping story and very well done. The acting is excellent. I found no dull moment, yet the film seemed overly long. Was it really necessary to drag out  some of the scenes to such a degree? Well, it was an excellent movie, without question and I think my quibbles are just minor. I'd give it 4.5 stars, but I have no way to do that so rounding it up to 5 seems  fair.Gary Peterson",5,Every Parent's Nightmare. Marvelous Set Piece.

1158864,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00188M5TM,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[2, 3]","This is another excellent film from Clint Eastwood. Even though it's not on the same level as his last four films (a remarkable run by anyone's standards), it's still very good and is worth seeing.The most remarkable thing about this film is the amazing performances from everyone involved.  Angelina Jolie proves, to me at least, that she is a fantastic actress.  She really becomes Christine Collins in this film. You stop thinking Angelina Jolie, tabloid star.  She's actually quite extraordinary, moving from subtlety to anger and hysteria without ever coming across as self conscious or over the top.  The performances by the children in this film are extremely well acted.  The interrogation scene where a child named Sanford Clarke (played by Eddie Alderson) confesses his complicity in a rash of serial killings is quite extraordinary to watch.  Alderson gives an extraordinarily performance filled with depth.  The police officers, played by Jeffrey Donovan and Michael Kelly, give excellent performances.  Kelly's is especially effective, playing the only really decent cop on the force.  John Malkovich is fine as usual.  Jason Butler Harner, who plays the serial killer who has something to do with the missing boy, is quite extraordinary and very creepy.  He's not over the top like many portrayals of serial killers are these days, and Clint doesn't romanticise him at all.  The scenes where we see the serial killer's work are shot superbly, showing enough blood to make the scenes sufficiently creepy, but never over indulging in it, like a lot of films these days do.  The film where the killer is hung is very well done as well.  Clint shows enough for you to realise how brutal hanging is.The main complaint here is that the script is rather predictable and doesn't have much memorable dialogue.  The story itself is fascinating (and sadly true), but I found much of the writing rather one-dimensional and obvious, especially many of the supporting characters, who seem more like plot devices than real people (the doctor who runs the asylum that Collins is committed to and Jeffrey Donovan's cop are good examples). It hurts the film a bit in my opinion. Aside from that, the production design is astoundingly good.  The film takes place in the 1920's, and you really feel that you're back there.  The phone operator venue where Christine Collins works is a wonder to behold.  It's wonderful production design. The cinematography is excellent as usual, and the music (by Eastwood himself) is especially effective, especially the sad theme that closes the film.The film is quite bleak and disturbing, showing the very dark side of man existed in 1920's Los Angeles as it does today.  Honestly, it's tough to watch at times.  Never does Eastwood sentimentalise anything, nor does he gloss over anything either.  This is quite a shocking true story.  If you dig Eastwood, you owe it to yourself to check this film out.  This was one of two films that Clint put out in 2008.  Most directors can barely manage one film a year, and Clint has made two excellent films in 2008 (Gran Torino is the other one, which is fantastic and better than this one).  The fact that he hardly got any nominations for both films is a travesty.  Methinks the Academy is jealous of Clint's output.",4,"Not Eastwood's best, but still damn good...",1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,3292,"['excellent', 'film', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Even', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'last', 'four', 'films', 'remarkable', 'run', 'anyone', 'standards', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'worth', 'seeing.The', 'most', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'film', 'amazing', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'least', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'really', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'film', 'stop', 'thinking', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'tabloid', 'star', 'actually', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'moving', 'subtlety', 'anger', 'hysteria', 'ever', 'coming', 'self', 'conscious', 'top', 'performances', 'children', 'film', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'where', 'child', 'named', 'Sanford', 'Clarke', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Alderson', 'complicity', 'rash', 'serial', 'killings', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'watch', 'Alderson', 'extraordinarily', 'performance', 'filled', 'depth', 'police', 'officers', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Kelly', 'especially', 'effective', 'playing', 'only', 'really', 'decent', 'cop', 'force', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'fine', 'usual', 'Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'who', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'something', 'do', 'missing', 'boy', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'very', 'creepy', 'not', 'top', 'many', 'portrayals', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'days', 'Clint', ""n't"", 'romanticise', 'scenes', 'where', 'see', 'serial', 'killer', 'work', 'are', 'shot', 'superbly', 'showing', 'enough', 'blood', 'make', 'scenes', 'sufficiently', 'creepy', 'never', 'indulging', 'lot', 'films', 'days', 'do', 'film', 'where', 'killer', 'hung', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'Clint', 'shows', 'enough', 'realise', 'how', 'brutal', 'hanging', 'is.The', 'main', 'complaint', 'here', 'script', 'rather', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'memorable', 'dialogue', 'story', 'fascinating', 'sadly', 'true', 'found', 'much', 'writing', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'obvious', 'especially', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'more', 'plot', 'devices', 'real', 'people', 'doctor', 'who', 'asylum', 'Collins', 'committed', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'cop', 'are', 'good', 'examples', 'film', 'bit', 'opinion', 'Aside', 'production', 'design', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'film', 'place', '1920', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'back', 'there', 'phone', 'operator', 'venue', 'where', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'wonder', 'behold', 'wonderful', 'production', 'design', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'usual', 'music', 'Eastwood', 'especially', 'effective', 'especially', 'sad', 'theme', 'film.The', 'film', 'quite', 'bleak', 'disturbing', 'showing', 'very', 'dark', 'side', 'man', 'existed', '1920', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'today', 'Honestly', 'tough', 'watch', 'times', 'Never', 'Eastwood', 'sentimentalise', 'anything', 'gloss', 'anything', 'either', 'quite', 'shocking', 'true', 'story', 'dig', 'Eastwood', 'owe', 'yourself', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'Clint', 'put', 'out', '2008', 'Most', 'directors', 'can', 'barely', 'manage', 'one', 'film', 'year', 'Clint', 'made', 'two', 'excellent', 'films', '2008', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'other', 'one', 'fantastic', 'better', 'one', 'fact', 'hardly', 'got', 'nominations', 'films', 'travesty', 'Academy', 'jealous', 'Clint', 'output']",Changeling Theatrical Release

Changeling is one of her best performances and proof of her underrated talent.While many ""true"" movie adaptations take heavy doses of creative interpretation, Changeling didn't have to rewrite history to that extent for the sake of dramatization. The story itself is incredible and would defy belief, but to their credit, the filmmakers have retained most of the actual details that transpired.  In particular, one has to applaud screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski for finding and developing the material.  The team behind this was rock solid - Ron Howard was originally slated to direct, but eventually gave the reins to Clint Eastwood because of scheduling conflicts.  The result is an Eastwood effort which ranks among his best directorial works.What makes this different from your mother's odyssey or missing child films is simply the strange circumstances of the case - a corrupt LA Police Department and murders - elements that no doubt attracted Eastwood.  But what emerges is a poignant portrait of a strong woman who remained defiant and determined to establish the truth.Few would put Jolie in the league of Kate Winslet (who eventually won the Oscar that year).  But she definitely holds her own in this one.

It's a bad cop story and a determined mom story packed into one.All the leads present a believable portrayal, except for the fact that the police will not face the truth of their mistake. Mom's life becomes a disaster, again caused by the LAPD.

I guess the fact that ""Mystic river"" had been awarded in 2005 was far enough to acknowledge the naked scars of a system, but Clint Eastwood as filmmaker has decided to keep being as Harry Callahan, (but behind camera) a real defender of the brutal and forgotten injustices around so many legal fissures. I think to myself that that attitude corresponds to an accustomed way to react before a presidential year. If you take a look around in this sense, without exception in those years of Presidential elections, the most nominated films deal with comedies, modern fables and epic actions but never with a sensible, brutal and real fact in March 10,1928 when suddenly Walter Collins vanished without leaving traces from his home and his mother - Christine Collins - made the best she could in order to find him.The dramatic tie deals with the fact the police force (much more worried for chasing Mob's members and extremely worried for the terrible crisis of the Great depression) seemed to ignore and overlook the begs and arguments exposed by Mrs. Collins for trying to convince that boy was not her son.The unexpected dramatic twist of the plot will leave you without breadth when the awful truth makes its appearance.The solid script even resisted the inexpressive performance of Mrs. Jollie (think about these three possible choices: Sarah Polley, Charlize Theron or Cate Blanchet) and the lack of effective punch of Jason Butler Harner as the serial killer (think about of Robert Downey Jr., Tim Roth or Willem Dafoe, for instance) Malkovich was -in that leader role- the most emblematic and effective member of the cast.Don't let it pass this admirable and realistic film.",5,A brutal drama from the real life's files!,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,1799,"['film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'overlooked', 'neglected', 'moment', 'regard', 'best', 'options', 'recent', 'Academy', 'Award', 'guess', 'fact', 'Mystic', 'river', 'had', 'been', 'awarded', '2005', 'was', 'far', 'enough', 'acknowledge', 'naked', 'scars', 'system', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'filmmaker', 'decided', 'keep', 'being', 'Harry', 'Callahan', 'camera', 'real', 'defender', 'brutal', 'forgotten', 'injustices', 'so', 'many', 'legal', 'fissures', 'think', 'myself', 'attitude', 'accustomed', 'way', 'react', 'presidential', 'year', 'take', 'look', 'around', 'sense', 'exception', 'years', 'Presidential', 'elections', 'most', 'nominated', 'films', 'deal', 'comedies', 'modern', 'fables', 'epic', 'actions', 'never', 'sensible', 'brutal', 'real', 'fact', 'March', '10,1928', 'when', 'suddenly', 'Walter', 'Collins', 'vanished', 'leaving', 'traces', 'home', 'mother', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'made', 'best', 'could', 'order', 'find', 'him.The', 'dramatic', 'tie', 'deals', 'fact', 'police', 'force', 'much', 'more', 'worried', 'chasing', 'Mob', 'members', 'extremely', 'worried', 'terrible', 'crisis', 'Great', 'depression', 'seemed', 'ignore', 'overlook', 'begs', 'arguments', 'exposed', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'trying', 'convince', 'boy', 'was', 'not', 'son.The', 'unexpected', 'dramatic', 'twist', 'plot', 'will', 'leave', 'breadth', 'when', 'awful', 'truth', 'appearance.The', 'solid', 'script', 'even', 'resisted', 'inexpressive', 'performance', 'Mrs.', 'Jollie', 'think', 'three', 'possible', 'choices', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Cate', 'Blanchet', 'lack', 'effective', 'punch', 'Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'serial', 'killer', 'think', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'instance', 'Malkovich', 'was', '-in', 'leader', 'role-', 'most', 'emblematic', 'effective', 'member', 'cast.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'pass', 'admirable', 'realistic', 'film']",Changeling Theatrical Release

After watching the movie, I was so interested in the details that I went to look up the true story myself. A city even changed its name in real life to avoid association with events that were portrayed in the movie! Angelina Jolie plays a convincing role as the single mother who wouldn't stop until she could find out about her son. Her supporting characters are pretty good as well. Most viewers will find the police in the story morally repugnant, will hate them and will be waiting for them to be torn apart in the film.No scene in the movie makes a reference to the title, but I looked it up anyway. A changeling is a creature posing as a child to replace the actual child that was taken away by a mythological creature.

Here he picks up a 'true' story, that could have been taken out of Kafka's story book, of course stretched and transposed to LA, and postponed by some years.A single mother's 9 y old son disappears. After some months the police force a changeling on her. Her protests (this is not my son) lead to her being locked up in a mental ward, where every step she takes proves that she is insane.This is a strange world. The police has units roam the streets with guns, shooting to kill rather than make captives; not fighting crime, but the competition. The police can lock up people at will. Disagreeing with the police proves insanity. A crude form of a premature Catch 22.But all is not lost, there are media who support the underdog and fight injustice. The legal system is still able to distinguish right from wrong. The closing note of the story is 'hope'.And let me put in a word for Ms.Jolie. I have read reviews which say that she 'overacts'. Frankly speaking, that sounds to me like the verdict of the shrink who thinks the sheer fact that she disagrees with the police in the question whether the boy is her son proves that she is nuts.

Alvi,"[2, 6]","This movie is certainly well crafted and delivered, with the writers, director, actors, etc. all having done their jobs quite skillfully (with the exception of one minor actor).  We feel that we're watching real people experiencing real events in real situations, so the movie succeeds in that vital way.But the next question, and I think the more important one, is what kind of experience the story presented in this movie creates for us, the audience.  On this score, I really have some reservations.  True, we witness the unrelenting love of a mother, and we see some noble people passionately fight for justice and succeed to some extent.  The former reminds us to not take our children for granted and the latter helps restore our faith in humanity, so the movie can be uplifting in these ways.  But we also witness a mother losing her child, and the same fate turns out to befall many other parents, which hits very painfully close to home for those of us who are parents.  As if that's not bad enough, the way in which these parents lose their children is too chilling for words (instead, the movie has graphics which are even worse).  And to top it off, we see shameless corruption by the police and psychiatric wards which immediately reminded me of Foucalt's analysis of how power can be exerted by labeling troublesome people as deviants.For me, the bottom line is that, on balance, I found this movie far more chilling and depressing than uplifting, and I wish I hadn't even watched it.  Indeed, I now have to hope that the awful imagery the movie has implanted in my mind will fade with time.  Needless to say, despite the fact that this movie has garnered mostly favorable reviews, I can't recommend watching it.

Given the cast and the director,  I really expected much more. While the movie's plot sounds intriguing, and this true life story is riveting, I felt the production wanting. There is enough real material in this historical tale , (it is so shocking and dramatic in itself), that the addional drama, superfluous details, and some of the overly emotional scenes, one right after another, make for too much ""sturm und drang."" Angelina Jolie gives a fine performance. However, even though her character is living through a total nightmare, her repetitious crying in almost every scene, through runny eyes, black with mascara, becomes a bit much. Meanwhile, not enough focus is placed on the corrupt LAPD, and  their role in the tragedy. They're the real villains here. In their efforts to close the case, they are ruthless in their attempts to avoid bad press.Christine Collins, (Jolie), a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles, works as a supervisor at a telephone company, roller skating up and down the switchboard line, trouble shooting with the operators when necessary. She is a good mother, working hard to support her son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), making sure he does his homework, playing at measuring his height against the wall, picking him up at school every day, and taking him on excursions when she is free. Christine is called to work, an extra shift, one Saturday. She returns home and finds Walter has gone missing. She scours the neighborhood, becoming more and more frantic as she realizes that her son has truly vanished. She calls the police, but is told by the man who answers, Detective Lester Ybarra, (Michael Kelly), that most missing children turn up by morning and she shouldn't worry. Ha!!! Ybarra does turn out to be the only good cop as he seriously works the case, trying to unravel the mystery of Walter's disappearance.  When the police finally arrive the next day, they take down all the vital information, including Walter's photograph, and tell the now hysterical mother that they will do their best.J.J. Jones, (Jeffrey Donovan), the head of the missing persons department, is condescending and arrogant, at best, while handling this tragedy. Meanwhile, Christine is conducting her own investigation, contacting the police in various cities to see if anyone has found a missing boy with her son's description. Radio preacher Rev. Gustav Briegleb, (John Malkovich), prays on the air for Christine and for the safe return of Walter. He and Christine have never met prior to this incident. The Rev. also lashes out at the LAPD for their corruption and laziness.Finally, Christine is informed that her son has been located. She rushes to meet the boy at the train, along with the police chief, but the boy turns out not to be her son. The reunion scene is documented by journalists and photographers, and the captain does not want to look incompetent nor does he want to embarrass the department. He persuades Christine to take the boy home for a night and promises she will realize that, after all the boy has been through, of course he has changed. However, a mother knows her child.Btw, a Changeling is a creature found in Western  European folklore.

1158880,A13BLSXL78EMRX,B00188M5TM,Jason Troy,"[2, 2]","In 1928, in Riverside county, California, a cold, dispassionate, demented and brutally insane serial killer named Gordon Northcott (Jason Buttler Harner) amasses a string of some twenty kidnappings, molestations and murders of young boys. His eventual arrest, capture and trial became National news, leading to his conviction. This extraordinary film is called "" Changeling "" and is based in part on the true events of the time, including the abduction of Walter Collins (Gattlin Griffith). The crime also lead to a direct investigation of the Los Angeles Police Department. Their ambivalent attitudes and corruption charges would eventually lead to the dismissal of Police Chief James Davis (Colm Feore), Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) and several other police Officers. The movie's heroes include Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), Dectective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) and Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). Together they expose the single minded effort of the police to convince Mrs. Collins that her kidnapped son was found and returned to her. However, the police are mistaken when they believe the case has been solved, as Mrs. Collins is not convinced the boy is her son. Waging a non-stop war with the police, the medical doctors and their cronies, she becomes a force to be reckoned with, despite being ignored, arrested, jailed and confined to a mental Instituation. The movie and all it's tragedy is perhaps a great tribute to Clint Eastwood (Director) in filming what for many is an incredible and unbelievable story of horror and disbelief. Yet when one sees the final product, there is little doubt, Eastwood and his cast has created a Classic. Touching and dramatically sensational, this movie is recommended to any seeking the great effort it takes to fight City Hall. ****",4,""" Don't tell me I'm wrong.

And I still didn't expect it to be *this* good.The story in itself is incredible enough, I mean, of course it deserves to be recount as a story (all the events actually happened in 1920s Los Angeles). But what gripped me was the execution.The setting is so accurate and so vivid you really think to be there. The pace of the film is just right. There isn't much action, because this is mostly an intimate story, but emotions comes to the viewer so strongly - through events and characters' actions and reactions that are always logic and never over the top - that you naturally feel involved. You naturally feel for this mother.But I think what really involved me in the story so much are the characters and the actors.All the actors are outstanding, in my opinion, no matter how long or short they appeared on the screen. I liked John Malkovich and Michael Kelly in particular, although they both appear on screen for limited time (Kelly only appears in the very last part of the film).But it's Angelina Jolie's performance that really stayed with me.

It is a haunting story of tragedy, strength, hope, courage and faith. Angelina Jolie (who I was never a fan of until I saw this picture) was amazing. She emoted the type of rage and anger that any mother would feel if this happened to her. But instead of just a regular movie ""Changeling"" is so much more. It was like watching a period motion picture straight out of the nineteen-twenties. The movie is absolutely riveting and fascinating. But it's also incredibly disturbing and haunting. Like a good book, this movie will get into your mind and cause you to think. I had to watch the DVD in 3 different sittings because it was so shocking. The scenes in the hospital were especially poignant because it was mixed with both tragedy and triumph. My favorite part was when Carol (Amy Ryan) gave that bigot doctor a good punch right in the face. John Malkovich was absolutely fantastic as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, playing totally against type. Although the movie is rather long (more than 2 hours) it does not drag on at all. This is the type of movie that is so tragic you will likely cry, yet there are even parts that may make you shed a tear of joy as well.

1158890,A1MDW2SCNOPCDJ,B00188M5TM,"Joel, Holden","[2, 2]","It lingers, this film. It is so brooding and involving. The 1920's have been re-created so perfectly. Identity is the key here. And how difficult it is to hang onto it, to protect it when everything is against the need of a mother to have her true son back home again. The cover up by the police. The monstrousness in the madhouse run by mad people. It is  that core fear of am I wrong? And never wrong. Never giving up.There are parallels here with what we've been through the last eight years. Though it is more. When manipulation comes at a woman full force, when the gods it seems are proving her wrong at every turn, that sweaty edginess comes in so seemlessly and deeply. We know as does she and that is the guilt of the thing. The denouement is so frightening and so creepy that it leaves me shaken.How easily identities can be stolen and how conscience can be wiped clean so totally. The most harrowing scenes are the realization of what has happened and how we can be taken away to hell because it fits the neat tucks and smooth bedding those in power, those who know best, who say you got off easily this time, you don't want to know, and that child they have placed you with, this is yours and the dimness of the lighting, the dimness of something that is collared in the corner, an attempt at faking a parent/a son and it's so true.Every word of it, every scene of it. We are not safe and this is a horror film that sets itself so long ago, so needful are we to believe in authority then especially. There are so many shadows here. There is such a palpable creepy scratchiness under the surface. Eastwood as director, a superb cast, brilliant sets and autos and feel and time and clothing, as we go deeper into the skin of a paranoia that is said the solution. It's so easy to do it that way. Too many eyes look away. Such manipulation in the taking away and the giving back. Evil.If the solution is guessed before hand, it probably is the wrong guess.

1158892,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00188M5TM,John F. Rooney,"[1, 2]","""The Changeling"" directed by Clint Eastwood is a period piece which begins in 1928 in L.A. Reminding me of Gene Tierney, Angelina Jolie, playing Christine, dominates the screen with her smear of lurid crimson lipstick and an inscrutable smile that emerges at inappropriate times. One afternoon while she's at work in the telephone company (she worked on rollerskates) supervising the operators, her young nine-year old son disappears. Why she didn't have a babysitter for such a young kid is beyond me.Be warned; this is a very intense movie. She reports the missing boy to the L.A. police who are none too cooperative. The boy, apparently, is found in another state, but when she sees him, she realizes it's not her boy, but a kid masquerading as her son. The police force, specifically Captain Jones played by Jeffrey Donovan, insists the boy is hers, and they have solved the case. Aided by John Malkovich as a crusading clergyman, she launches a campaign against the corrupt police force.The police put her in a mental hospital without a court order, a snake pit, where she barely misses getting a shock treatment. She was lucky they didn't give her a lobotomy. (Or did they?) A child murderer and his boy assistant enter the picture. Her son may have been a victim.As I watched the last part of the movie, I counted at least five places where it could have effectively ended, but Eastwood was intent on tying up every loose end, and he was adamant in making sure that her vindication would come in all manner of ways. She sees the LAPD and its henchmen get their comeuppance, and she sees justice sort of triumph. And then what happened? Eastwood will close every last door before the credits roll.It's a beautiful period piece with authentic set features: the clothes, (her cloche hat), the old autos, the trolley cars, the streets done to perfection, all done lovingly and with great care. No expenses were spared on the setting and background, but more could have been spent on editing.Angelina does a great job, but I felt as if she were very aware that she was playing a part. Barbara Stanwyck incarnate. Believable, but too aware of her role as an actress, like the actresses of the thirties and forties, she didn't really inhabit the part, didn't or couldn't submerge herself entirely in the character.

After 5 months of worrying, the Los Angeles Police Department tell Christine they've found her son in Illinois. When the boy is returned to her, Christine is shocked to learn that the boy is not Walter, despite the fact that the boy claims he is Walter and can even dutifully recite his home address. Despite Christine's insistence that the boy is not Walter, the LAPD do all they can to refute her claim.John Malkovich co-stars as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, who publicly airs his disapproval of the LAPD's methods on the radio and ultimately offers to help Christine fight the police department over their incompetent investigations.Besides its shocking (and shockingly true) story, what's really shocking about Changeling is Jolie. The media frenzy that has accompanied her for the past few years causes one to forget that she actually possesses considerable talent as an actress. Yes, she fits the role well physically as her beauty fits in with almost any time period, but she also brings both depth and believability to her performance. It's most definitely Oscar-worthy.Eastwood deliberately cast Malkovich against type and it's nice to see him playing a sympathetic character while still commanding the screen. Malkovich plays this character as both warm and intense, handling both facets flawlessly.Jason Butler Harner deserves a quick honorable mention for his performance as Gordon Northcott, as he is absolutely convincing and chilling.With this and the rarely matched dramatic intensity much of the film provides, also stand-out is the meticulous re-creation of the timeframe. Everything from the makeup to the costumes to the art direction brilliantly brings 1920s L.A. to life.With all of this in mind, Changeling further confirms Eastwood's status as one of Hollywood's great living filmmakers. Pushing 80, the man's output of great films rivals that of almost any director working today. Many filmmakers struggle to make even one great movie a year; Eastwood (who also composed the haunting score for this film) made two!Changeling is a gripping, powerful, and very well-acted film that is definitely worth seeking out.GRADE: A-",5,A Gripping & Powerful Film,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,2549,"['Changeling', 'first', 'two', 'great', 'movies', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'directed', '2008', 'other', 'beingGran', 'Torino', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'heartbreaking', 'true', 'story', 'mother', 'undying', 'determination', 'find', 'missing', 'son', 'amidst', 'law', 'enforcement', 'corruption', 'circa', '1920s', 'Los', 'Angeles.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'home', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'son', 'Walter', 'missing', '5', 'months', 'worrying', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'Department', 'tell', 'Christine', ""'ve"", 'found', 'son', 'Illinois', 'When', 'boy', 'returned', 'Christine', 'shocked', 'learn', 'boy', 'not', 'Walter', 'fact', 'boy', 'Walter', 'can', 'even', 'dutifully', 'recite', 'home', 'address', 'Christine', 'insistence', 'boy', 'not', 'Walter', 'LAPD', 'do', 'can', 'refute', 'claim.John', 'Malkovich', 'co-stars', 'Reverend', 'Gustav', 'Briegleb', 'who', 'publicly', 'disapproval', 'LAPD', 'methods', 'radio', 'ultimately', 'help', 'Christine', 'fight', 'police', 'department', 'incompetent', 'shocking', 'shockingly', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'really', 'shocking', 'Changeling', 'Jolie', 'media', 'frenzy', 'accompanied', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'one', 'forget', 'actually', 'considerable', 'talent', 'actress', 'Yes', 'role', 'well', 'physically', 'beauty', 'fits', 'almost', 'time', 'period', 'also', 'depth', 'believability', 'performance', 'most', 'definitely', 'Oscar-worthy.Eastwood', 'deliberately', 'cast', 'Malkovich', 'type', 'nice', 'see', 'playing', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'still', 'commanding', 'screen', 'Malkovich', 'character', 'warm', 'intense', 'handling', 'facets', 'flawlessly.Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'quick', 'honorable', 'mention', 'performance', 'Gordon', 'Northcott', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'chilling.With', 'rarely', 'matched', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'much', 'film', 'also', 'stand-out', 'meticulous', 're-creation', 'timeframe', 'Everything', 'makeup', 'costumes', 'art', 'direction', 'brilliantly', '1920s', 'L.A.', 'life.With', 'mind', 'Changeling', 'further', 'confirms', 'Eastwood', 'status', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'living', 'filmmakers', 'Pushing', '80', 'man', 'output', 'great', 'films', 'rivals', 'almost', 'director', 'working', 'today', 'Many', 'filmmakers', 'struggle', 'make', 'even', 'one', 'great', 'movie', 'year', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'also', 'composed', 'haunting', 'score', 'film', 'made', 'two', 'Changeling', 'gripping', 'powerful', 'very', 'well-acted', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out.GRADE', 'A-']",Changeling Theatrical Release

Mrs. Collins goes to work one day and when she returns she finds her son is missing, so she calls the police which starts a series of events and police procedures that are shocking, for instance it was standard procedure to wait 24 hours before the police would file a report on a missing child. The police find the boy five months later, but the boy who is returned isn't her child. Mrs. Collins repeatedly tells the police it isn't her child while they try to convince her it is her child and that she's crazy even going so far as bringing in a doctor to try to assuage her concerns with ridiculous expertise ""trauma can some times shrink a person."" That would come off as lame and laughable if you weren't at the center of the events. Mrs. Collins continues the fight to find her son, and as the events unfold they continue to shock us that police could have the power to substitute a woman's son while trying to convince her it was her son, and think they could get away with it.The acting throughout is strong, it's good to see Angelina Jolie acting again after the walk through stint in Wanted. I can't think of one weak performance in the movie, John Malkovich turns in a subdued performance as a radio preacher trying to expose the corruption of the L.A. Police. As a director Clint Eastwood moves you (emotionally) along with the story, we feel Mrs. Collins' frustration as the police do their best to shut her away, and we feel relief as justice prevails and she's rescued from the fate of being left in an asylum. Eastwood doesn't follow the standard clich&eacute;'s of what you would expect, once you think it's going to be a police procedural he changes direction as seamlessly as switching gears, when you think it may be about serial killer he moves the movie along as easily as the needle of  phonograph onto the next song on the album.The bonus features include two making of documentaries, the first a misnamed feature titled Clint Eastwood and Angelina Jolie Partners In Crime but it covers all facets of the production except food service, which I found interesting.Clint Eastwood has created iconic and memorable characters as an actor but I think he will be more remembered for the movies he's directed; here's hoping there's a lot more coming!",4,"Subtle, Period Piece",1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,2499,"['Watching', 'movie', 'Changeling', 'one', 'ask', 'there', 'time', 'L.A.', 'police', 'department', 'was', ""n't"", 'corrupt', 'Changeling', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'single', 'mother', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'boy', '1928', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'son', 'missing', 'police', 'series', 'events', 'police', 'procedures', 'are', 'shocking', 'instance', 'was', 'standard', 'procedure', 'wait', '24', 'hours', 'police', 'would', 'file', 'report', 'missing', 'child', 'police', 'find', 'boy', 'five', 'months', 'later', 'boy', 'who', 'returned', ""n't"", 'child', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'repeatedly', 'police', ""n't"", 'child', 'try', 'convince', 'child', 'crazy', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'bringing', 'doctor', 'try', 'assuage', 'concerns', 'ridiculous', 'expertise', 'trauma', 'can', 'times', 'shrink', 'person', 'would', 'come', 'off', 'lame', 'laughable', 'were', ""n't"", 'center', 'events', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'fight', 'find', 'son', 'events', 'unfold', 'continue', 'shock', 'police', 'could', 'have', 'power', 'substitute', 'woman', 'son', 'trying', 'convince', 'was', 'son', 'think', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'it.The', 'acting', 'strong', 'good', 'see', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'acting', 'again', 'walk', 'stint', 'Wanted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'weak', 'performance', 'movie', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'subdued', 'performance', 'radio', 'preacher', 'trying', 'expose', 'corruption', 'L.A.', 'Police', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'emotionally', 'story', 'feel', 'Mrs.', 'Collins', 'frustration', 'police', 'do', 'best', 'shut', 'away', 'feel', 'relief', 'justice', 'prevails', 'rescued', 'fate', 'being', 'left', 'asylum', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'follow', 'standard', 'clich', 'eacute', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'once', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'police', 'procedural', 'direction', 'as', 'seamlessly', 'switching', 'gears', 'when', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'as', 'easily', 'needle', 'phonograph', 'next', 'song', 'album.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'two', 'making', 'documentaries', 'first', 'misnamed', 'feature', 'titled', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Partners', 'Crime', 'facets', 'production', 'food', 'service', 'found', 'interesting.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'created', 'iconic', 'memorable', 'characters', 'actor', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'remembered', 'movies', 'directed', 'here', 'hoping', 'lot', 'more', 'coming']",Changeling Theatrical Release

1158900,A24ZLCVW2715QT,B00188M5TM,"Karen Franklin ""Forensic Psychologist""","[94, 100]","Changeling is a powerful film. It tells the forgotten story of a working-class woman who brought down the corrupt establishment of Los Angeles 80 years ago.Angelina Jolie gives a strong, Oscar-worthy performance as Christine Collins, a single mother and one of the first female supervisors at the phone company who refuses to bow down to corrupt police when her son vanished without a trace in 1928.Los Angeles on the brink of the Great Depression was an epitome of corruption. The police chief, James ""Two Guns"" Davis, had an officially sanctioned ""gun squad"" that terrorized opponents with impunity. When Collins' son Walter vanished, the L.A. police were embarrassed by their inability to find him. To squelch public criticism, they tried to convince Collins that a young drifter was her son. When Collins protested, police Captain J.J. Jones labeled her as histrionic and delusional and had her locked in a ""psychopathic ward.""Luckily for Collins, her plight came to the attention of Gustav A. Briegleb, a Presbyterian minister and community organizer who regularly lambasted police corruption on his radio show. Briegleb helped Collins get a lawyer and tell her story. Although the movie does not mention it, Collins' case led to passage of a law that prohibited police from incarcerating people in psychiatric facilities absent due process.Despite the compelling nature of Collins' story, it came close to being forgotten. The old records were about to be incinerated when a city worker telephoned screenwriter and former journalist J. Michael Straczynski and told him to come over and take a look. What Straczynski read that day was so compelling that he spent a year poring over city archives to reconstruct the case.Straczynski has said that he wrote the script to honor Collins: A woman whose ""simple question, `Where is my son?' brought down the entire L.A. city structure.""Changeling owes its aura of authenticity to Straczynski's meticulous research; verbatim quotes from the files and direct testimony from the public hearings are incorporated into the script.The film's power also owes to its feminist message about a strong woman who refuses to be silenced by a corrupt establishment. The scenes from the public hospital's ""psychopathic ward"" provide a grim reminder of the horrors faced by women who were labeled as crazy for resisting male authority.Clint Eastwood was a great choice of director to tell this story. The acting is uniformly excellent, the plot presses forward inexorably, and attention to detail is exhibited throughout. The location shots are masterful in transporting us back in time, as Collins (Jolie) hops on and off streetcars in a convincingly reconstructed 1920s Los Angeles.Although the film closely parallels the actual history, viewers should be aware that Eastwood took some dramatic liberties, presumably to streamline the story and highlight its good-versus-evil message. We don't find out, for example, that the missing boy had a father who was serving time at Folsom Prison for robbery. Nor is the presentation of the infamous Wineville Chicken Coop murder case entirely accurate. Killer Gordon Stewart Northcott was indeed hanged at San Quentin, but the film does not mention that his mother was convicted of the Collins murder and spent 12 years in prison.For those who are interested in additional background on that case, it is the topic of a just-published book by James Paul,Nothing is Strange with You: The Life and Crimes of Gordon Stewart Northcott.

1158902,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00188M5TM,Kevin Killian,"[2, 3]","Just by chance we went to see CHANGELING right after we saw AUGUST RUSH, the 2007 musical melodrama which deals with a mother and son separated by cruel fate and yearning to be reunited.  While the new film is about 100 times better than AUGUST RUSH, it still lacks a certain something I can't put my finger on, but probably it is that because it is a true story, director Clint Eastwood can't improvise on the story of Christine Collins, the tragic mother from 1920s Los Angeles who lost her son not once, but twice, -- or did she?  The ending is left in a delicate suspension.Despite a certain dramatic inertia in the film, I'm glad that Eastwood and his screenwriter did not go the way of current Hollywood screenwriting commandments.  A Syd Field style screenplay would have made sure that Christine (Angelina Jolie) would gather some unlikely, even wacky, allies and storm the citadel where where her boy was being held.  I can see them now, brigades of roller skating switchboard operators hollering defiance and unexpected physical strength.  In a way, the movie actually veers in that direction a little bit, when it introduces Amy Ryan as Carol Becker, a prostitute with a heart of gold who teaches Christine a valuable lesson about the meaning of courage.  I wonder if the Carol Becker subplot was ""true,"" somehow I doubt it, it seems very much an invention of our current age where we value solidarity between classes above all else, certainly dramatic credibility.  That said, the scenes with Ryan and Jolie are among the best in the movie: both women should win Oscars, but will they?  Will Hollywood ever forgive Angelina Jolie for being so willful?  Year after year, she turns in great performance, and yet the snubs keep coming.  Maybe it was kissing her brother on the lips the night she did win the one Oscar from GIRL INTERRUPTED.Well, in a certain sense CHANGELING is like a prequel to GIRL INTERRUPTED and it looks like they filmed it right in the same inhuman;y cruel insane asylum.  Angelina never looks more beautiful then when her smoldering eyes and twiching nose are photographed from behind the bars of those little grates in the door that contemptuous guards and nurses can slam on her, little knowing she will be back for heavy revenge as soon as its time for the penultimate reel.  CHANGELING seems like it's going to be about police corruption; then it turns into a story about one heroic cop and how he penetrates a wall of indifference and deceit to uncover the horrible crimes of a serial killer--maybe to show that, even in 1928 LA, cops aren't *uniformly* evil slaves of Moloch?  Eastwood brings all of these different films in on time with a master's steady hand.  If I were producing a film about paint drying, I'd try to get him to direct it, for at least it would be hypnotically interesting and look authentically period.Warning, the film is really extraordinarily violent and upsetting, and please don't bring your children, it is too intense for them right now.PS., Was the traditional carol ""Silent Night"" actually sung by one of the leading characters right in the very site and time that the screenplay has him do it--only to get broken off when he reaches the words, ""Round von virgin mother and child?""",4,The Ballad of Christine Collins,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,3251,"['Just', 'chance', 'went', 'see', 'CHANGELING', 'right', 'saw', 'AUGUST', 'RUSH', '2007', 'musical', 'melodrama', 'mother', 'son', 'separated', 'cruel', 'fate', 'yearning', 'be', 'reunited', 'new', 'film', 'about', '100', 'times', 'better', 'AUGUST', 'RUSH', 'still', 'certain', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'probably', 'true', 'story', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'improvise', 'story', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'tragic', 'mother', '1920s', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'did', 'ending', 'left', 'delicate', 'suspension.Despite', 'certain', 'dramatic', 'inertia', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Eastwood', 'screenwriter', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'current', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriting', 'commandments', 'Syd', 'Field', 'style', 'screenplay', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sure', 'Christine', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'would', 'gather', 'unlikely', 'even', 'wacky', 'allies', 'storm', 'citadel', 'where', 'where', 'boy', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'can', 'see', 'now', 'brigades', 'roller', 'skating', 'switchboard', 'operators', 'hollering', 'defiance', 'unexpected', 'physical', 'strength', 'way', 'movie', 'actually', 'veers', 'direction', 'little', 'bit', 'when', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'Carol', 'Becker', 'prostitute', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'Christine', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'meaning', 'courage', 'wonder', 'Carol', 'Becker', 'subplot', 'was', 'true', 'somehow', 'doubt', 'very', 'much', 'invention', 'current', 'age', 'where', 'value', 'solidarity', 'classes', 'else', 'certainly', 'dramatic', 'credibility', 'said', 'scenes', 'Ryan', 'Jolie', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'women', 'should', 'win', 'Oscars', 'will', 'Will', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'forgive', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'being', 'so', 'willful', 'Year', 'year', 'great', 'performance', 'yet', 'snubs', 'keep', 'coming', 'Maybe', 'was', 'kissing', 'brother', 'lips', 'night', 'did', 'win', 'one', 'Oscar', 'GIRL', 'INTERRUPTED.Well', 'certain', 'sense', 'CHANGELING', 'prequel', 'GIRL', 'INTERRUPTED', 'filmed', 'right', 'same', 'inhuman', 'cruel', 'insane', 'asylum', 'Angelina', 'never', 'more', 'beautiful', 'then', 'when', 'smoldering', 'eyes', 'twiching', 'nose', 'are', 'photographed', 'bars', 'little', 'grates', 'door', 'contemptuous', 'guards', 'nurses', 'can', 'slam', 'little', 'knowing', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'heavy', 'revenge', 'as', 'soon', 'time', 'penultimate', 'reel', 'CHANGELING', 'going', 'be', 'police', 'corruption', 'then', 'story', 'one', 'heroic', 'cop', 'how', 'wall', 'indifference', 'deceit', 'uncover', 'horrible', 'crimes', 'serial', 'killer', 'maybe', 'show', 'even', '1928', 'LA', 'cops', 'are', ""n't"", '*uniformly*', 'evil', 'slaves', 'Moloch', 'Eastwood', 'different', 'films', 'time', 'master', 'steady', 'hand', 'were', 'producing', 'film', 'paint', 'drying', ""'d"", 'try', 'get', 'direct', 'least', 'would', 'be', 'hypnotically', 'interesting', 'look', 'authentically', 'period.Warning', 'film', 'really', 'extraordinarily', 'violent', 'upsetting', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'children', 'too', 'intense', 'right', 'now.PS.', 'Was', 'traditional', 'carol', 'Silent', 'Night', 'actually', 'sung', 'one', 'leading', 'characters', 'right', 'very', 'site', 'time', 'screenplay', 'do', 'only', 'get', 'broken', 'off', 'when', 'words', 'Round', 'von', 'virgin', 'mother', 'child']",Changeling Theatrical Release
1158903,AHBKHBIWDTI5I,B00188M5TM,Kevin Mattingly,"[3, 5]","THE CHANGELING is a success in everything that it sets out to do. It is a rarity in film making in that it also manages to make you feel every emotion that you have in your gut. It's not often that this translates from the screen to the viewer in such a palpable manner and steadily progress the storyline.This suspenseful tragedy is expertly directed by Clint Eastwood and despite the fact that it's about a possibly dead child it manages to let you simmer in your emotions rather some of his other depression-inducing movies that I've seen. This feeling in this is more on par with his newest film GRAND TORINO.It's 1928 in Los Angeles and the police department is oozing with corruption to the point where they murder the gangsters not out of a sense of justice but out of competition in the illegal money making rackets. It is in front of this backdrop that we are introduced to the protagonist, Christine Collins, who is a single mother who works as a switchboard operator.Christine establishes her honesty and integrity very early in the film by explaining to her son that his father couldn't accept responsibility rather than lie to him.There was no one else to help but some neighbors who were to check in on him when Christine went to work. She returns from her job later that night to find that her son is missing and it is impossible to know how long he has been gone. She calls the police and receives the standard, ""We can't do anything for 24 hours and besides, these kids always show up."" In her case her son did not show up and she is frantically trying to locate him as any mother would.John Malkovich plays a minister who has a radio show that focuses on exposing the corruption and cons with which the police department is rife and he had quite a following of concerned citizens who are with him. He discusses Christine's case on the radio.With all of the negative exposure the police department has been getting for their nefarious deeds they do not want another black eye.A little boy is brought to Christine and is announced by the police in front of the media to be hers. He is not her child although he pretends to be. She tries to protest amid the media frenzy that he is not hers. She takes him home and tries to figure out what is going on and why this child is calling her ""mommy."" In very short order she is back at the police station trying to explain the situation and ends up being accused as being either a negligent parent who doesn't want her child or a woman who was so disrupted by her son missing as to become unhinged. The police know that they have given her the wrong child and have her admitted to an insane asylum where she encounters many other women who are in there for the same reason as her. They are all there for saying the police are wrong and locked away to cover up the many misdeeds by law enforcement.Christine tries to do all of the right things to get out but realizes that anything she does or says can be interpreted as some disorder or another.Meanwhile, the minister is trying to find out what happened to her and is demanding to know where she is. At the same time a seemingly vagrant child is found on an old ranch and the local police think that he's just trying to escape extradition to Canada but he has a story about his uncle to tell...It gets far murkier from there.For me to go any further into the climax and falling action of the plot would ruin the suspense of the film and I wouldn't do that in a review. My assertion is that this is a 5 star movie if I've ever seen one and is probably Jolie's best role and performance to date. Malkovich is great as well.This film is all the more affecting in the fact that it's a true story. 80 years ago or today this is the kind of tale that can pull your emotions in a million different ways and leave you feeling vanquished before it is finished. All of the costumes and props lend incredible validity to the story. I felt like I was in a 1928 time warp while watching it.All in all, one of Jolie, Malkovich, and Eastwood's finest films.Highly recommended.

Cut an hour out of it and give it some ""oomph"" and it would have been fascinating.By the end I really didn't care to see the finish...it didn't seem to matter to me at all what the final outcome was.Here's the story:One day in 1920's Los Angeles a single mother comes home from work one day and her son is gone.  She frantically calls the police and they aren't very helpful.  Luckily, a local minister with a radio show broadcasts her story, creates a stink about it.  The police find her son and re-unite them.  But it's not her son.  But the police assure her she's just confused from the trauma etc.  She goes to dentists, neighbours, teachers, etc. and they all agree with her; it's not her son.  So she hounds the LAPD some more.  They throw her in a mental ward to shut her up.  Meanwhile, a serial killer (who killed 20+ children) is discovered, and her son is among the dead (perhaps).  The minister gets a lawyer and storms the mental hospital, freeing the mother.  They all expose what the LAPD did (the switcheroo with the kid to shut up the public about him gone missing when they should have been finding that serial killer, and locking her and other women up in a mental ward to shut them up).  The LAPD captains lose their jobs, the serial killer is hanged.  THE END.That's it.  That's basically all that happens in the film.  It really shouldn't be that long.It just drags and drags and drags.  There's a ""serial killer in court"" scene, a ""serial killer talks to the mother scene"", and a ""serial killer gets hanged scene"" tacked onto the end...all for no reason at all.  They could have just shown a 5 second clip of him being hanged and we would lose nothing from it.  Same thing with the police captain trial.  He loses his job and the courtroom all claps and cheers wildly.  All of this can be cut.  It's just all padded nonsense.Also, they threw in some historical inaccuracies just for kicks.  The serial killer actually killed the boys along with his mother; there were 4 boys killed, not 20+, no boys escaped from the ranch, etc.I suggest just reading the wikipedia page and giving the movie a pass:[...]",1,"Plodding, plodding, plodding.....",1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,2257,"['2', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'yet', 'reason', 'world', 'needed', 'be', 'long', 'pretty', 'simple', 'story', 'Cut', 'hour', 'give', 'oomph', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'finish', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'what', 'final', 'outcome', 'story', 'One', 'day', '1920', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'single', 'mother', 'home', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'son', 'gone', 'frantically', 'police', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'helpful', 'Luckily', 'local', 'minister', 'radio', 'show', 'story', 'stink', 'police', 'find', 'son', 're-unite', 'not', 'son', 'police', 'assure', 'just', 'confused', 'trauma', 'etc', 'dentists', 'neighbours', 'teachers', 'etc', 'agree', 'not', 'son', 'LAPD', 'more', 'throw', 'mental', 'ward', 'shut', 'up', 'Meanwhile', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'killed', '20+', 'children', 'discovered', 'son', 'dead', 'perhaps', 'minister', 'lawyer', 'mental', 'hospital', 'freeing', 'mother', 'expose', 'what', 'LAPD', 'did', 'switcheroo', 'kid', 'shut', 'up', 'public', 'gone', 'missing', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'finding', 'serial', 'killer', 'locking', 'other', 'women', 'up', 'mental', 'ward', 'shut', 'up', 'LAPD', 'captains', 'lose', 'jobs', 'serial', 'killer', 'hanged', 'END.That', 'basically', 'film', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'long.It', 'just', 'drags', 'drags', 'drags', 'serial', 'killer', 'court', 'scene', 'serial', 'killer', 'talks', 'mother', 'scene', 'serial', 'killer', 'hanged', 'scene', 'tacked', 'end', 'reason', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'shown', '5', 'second', 'clip', 'being', 'hanged', 'would', 'lose', 'nothing', 'Same', 'thing', 'police', 'captain', 'trial', 'job', 'courtroom', 'claps', 'cheers', 'wildly', 'can', 'be', 'cut', 'just', 'padded', 'nonsense.Also', 'threw', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'just', 'kicks', 'serial', 'killer', 'actually', 'killed', 'boys', 'mother', 'were', '4', 'boys', 'killed', 'not', '20+', 'boys', 'escaped', 'ranch', 'etc.I', 'suggest', 'just', 'reading', 'wikipedia', 'page', 'giving', 'movie', 'pass', '[', ']']",Changeling Theatrical Release
1158906,A2J4OBH609ZTW,B00188M5TM,Kindle Customer,"[0, 1]","Despite my three star review I still feel this is a must-see movie. The story is so compelling it makes you wonder why this was never made into a movie before. There's so much going on here, though, that I think all the material handcuffed Eastwood a bit. The lost child; the corrupt LAPD; the grief-stricken mother; the ""fake"" son; the heartless detective; the crusading minster; the illegal commitment to the mental hospital; the serial killer...and it goes on and on like that! Any one of these elements would've made a fine movie, but crammed all together in a two-hour plus film is just too much to take in. But my biggest complaint is how hamfisted some of the scenes are handled. The over-the-top acting. Not by Angelina Jolie, mind you; her Oscar nomination was well-earned (except for a particularly improbable scene in the jailhouse, when she bitch-slaps her son's killer). Several scenes are far more sensationalistic than need be. At times it plays more like a made-for-TV movie. And for someone like Clint Eastwood, one of the finest directors working today, I just expected MUCH better.

She met with little cooperation from the police, and when they finally found the boy and brought him back home, she said, ""That's not my son.""This movie was based on a true story and directed by Clint Eastwood in a gritty, no-frills style. There isn't a lot of action, but it definitely holds your interest until the very end. Jolie gives a strong performance as the mother who wouldn't stop looking for her son, even when she battled the corrupt police chief. Jolie is on-screen just about every minute and is a formidable screen presence. She and the rest of the cast, including John Malkovich, are all good in this very somber and intense piece.The costumes, sets, and locations are perfectly done in 1920s style and the photography uses a lot of natural light adding to the old-fashioned feel.

Scenery, lighting, sets, and costuming all convey an authentic period feel in a film that is grimly somber from start to finish. Some scenes (a hanging and some ax murders) are graphically disturbing, though brief, and Eastwood's score is subtle and unobtrusive; as a director, he has generally relied on the story line to stimulate emotion, rather than music to  create it artificially.While it does bog down in places, this is a movie worth viewing, for its ability to demonstrate how easily a corrupt system can control and damage the lives of countless individuals who place their trust in it.",3,Lost,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,1270,"['Changeling', 'story', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'quest', 'find', 'young', 'son', 'Walter', 'missing', 'trace', 'also', 'story', 'appalling', 'corruption', 'government', 'police', 'department', ""1920's-'30"", 'Los', 'Angeles', 'apparently', 'been', 'significant', 'problem', 'long-standing', 'third', 'subplot', 'serial', 'child', 'killer', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'contact', 'Walter', 'forth', 'horrific', 'view', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'local', 'hospital.Angela', 'Jolie', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'turn', 'admirable', 'performances', 'spite', 'need', 'cope', 'too-lengthy', 'script', 'melodrama', 'many', 'spots', 'Scenery', 'lighting', 'sets', 'costuming', 'convey', 'authentic', 'period', 'feel', 'film', 'grimly', 'somber', 'start', 'finish', 'scenes', 'hanging', 'ax', 'murders', 'are', 'graphically', 'disturbing', 'though', 'brief', 'Eastwood', 'score', 'subtle', 'unobtrusive', 'director', 'generally', 'relied', 'story', 'line', 'stimulate', 'emotion', 'rather', 'music', 'create', 'bog', 'down', 'places', 'movie', 'worth', 'viewing', 'ability', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'easily', 'corrupt', 'system', 'can', 'control', 'damage', 'lives', 'countless', 'individuals', 'who', 'place', 'trust']",Changeling Theatrical Release

Power ""nlp trainer""","[2, 3]","Throughout an illustrious directing career Clint Eastwood has crafted some of the most memorable movies of the last 15 years, movies such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby. He has won five Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and the Irving Thalberg award.In the process the actors he has worked with have been blessed with Academy Awards: Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman in Million Dollar Baby, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins in Mystic River,and Gene Hackman in Unforgiven.With his other movie of 2008, Gran Torino, as Director and Actor he has delivered one of the best movies of the year, and one of his own most memorable performances, and now delivers another outstanding movie in Changeling.Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for Girl Interrupted. Changeling marks her second nomination.A huge amount of credit for this movie though must go to writer J Michael Straczynski, creator of Babylon 5, who got a call one day, and the caller said: ""We're throwing out some old records, and there is something you gotta see.""  A true story that beggars belief.Christine Collins' son was kidnapped, and the police returned to her 5 months later a boy who said his name was Walter Collins, but she said he was not her boy.  Her protests fall on the deaf ears of Police Capt JJ Jones played by Jeffrey Donovan of Burn Notice.  So begins one of the most notorious coverups of an already disreputable police department.The attention to detail in the story is nothing short of incredible,  particularly in the mental hospital scenes, which are very true to life. The psychiatrist excels at twisting her story to make her look nuts, using double binds to manipulate her, simultaneously threatening and cajoling her, with unknown potentially dangerous drugs or electric shock treatments.  (Either you're lying or you're nuts.) Amy Ryan plays the tart with a heart, an ally who explains the system, a small but very important role, and shocking.Oftentimes the Hollywood idea of a true story takes many liberties with the facts, distorting the actual events.  In this case, as far as I can discern nearly everything important is true, including meeting Northcott in San Quentin.A couple of minor facts have been changed. Her husband was in jail at the time of her son's kidnappping for armed robbery, not the explanation she gives her son.  A fact left out of the movie was that she pursued Capt JJ Jones legally for years, won judgments but never got any money out of him.What is up with Jeffrey Donovan's accent? He occasional lapses into a highly dubious stage Oirish accent, (which he probably got off his Burn Notice ex girlfriend, whose Oirish accent is also highly suspect).Angelina plays the part very well, neither going for hysteria nor a victim/martyr portrayal which would have ruined the movie.  She is more the reluctant crusader, who wins important allies along the way, changing important laws in LA.Clint Eastwood apparently wrote the music for the movie. The sequence of music with the montages at the end is particularly good. I also loved the performance of the good cop.

1158921,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B00188M5TM,Marc Cabir Davis,"[1, 1]","Clint Eastwoods' dark, almost gothic interpretation of historical source material in ""Changeling"" is audacious both in its' devotion to fact and its' insistence on telling three stories at once. Both these techniques work, to a degree, resulting in a rich production that seems unfairly neglected during the 2009 Awards Season. Typically, this is exactly the sort of critical epic that would win over art-house audiences and keep historians busy for days, but it almost thoroughly sacrifices any attempt at commercial success - a point made more evident by the sombre, almost dreamlike pace at which the film unfolds.At the center of this true story is Christine Collins, who forms both the focal point and the driving force for the entire motion picture. Ably portrayed by Jolie, the performance is decidedly one-note (there are only so many times one can hear ""I want MY son back!"" before it renders itself insipid), but the lead actress works hard to invest the role with the exact amount of fortitude, defiance and grit. As in any 'actress-driven' role, Eastwood gives her much material - a courtroom scene, the gratuitous mental asylum scene, and of course the beautifully lit scenes where we are reminded that Collins is indeed played by Jolie (here almost white-faced with foundation and an omnipresent red lip-color).The supporting actors are in turn the perfect foil for Jolie's spirited performance. John Malkovich uses his oft-practiced slow-speech phonetic mechanism to infuse his character with both charm and humor. He represents perhaps the films' only positive male role model, as the rest of the movie goes on to label all male institutions as intrinsically flawed and even evil. The interconnected storylines - the quest for a serial killer, the corruption within the police department, and the hunt for a missing child, are all perfectly balanced with the standout storyline - the insistence by a parent that their child is not theirs'. Memorable scenes are many - primarily involving Collins being questioned by a psychiatrist (where he effectively employs the reverse questioning mechanism to prove she is in fact insane and a liar), and Collins' final encounter with the man who may have killed her son (another critical high moment for Jolie).Eastwoods' lush 1920s-influenced Jazz score is adequate, with the running motif and background instrumentation all working in its' favor. This is a slice of Americana most moviegoers aren't used to, but the beautiful cinematography falls second to the wondrous script, which interweaves historical data with actual courtroom transcripts. A reviewer once said that 'theres something here for everyone', and that is in part true. But ""Changeling"" is a demanding motion picture, when it heats up its almost breathless in its velocity, but for the most part it is quiet and sedentary, relying primarily on dialogue to drive the story forward.Clint Eastwood has made a few better films, but this is easily one of his most accomplished achievements. For once, Jolie looks thoroughly absorbed in her role (the last time we witnessed her like this was on ""Beyond Borders"" from many years ago), but the only downside is that her star is far bigger than the character she is playing. If ever, the film shows us that the world in 1928 was perhaps just as bad, if worse, than the current world we're living in. Whether or not that brings you comfort, ""Changeling"" is a challenging, engrossing film that surprisingly stands up on repeated viewing.Four and a Half Stars.",4,Eastwood & The House of the Seven Gables,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,3522,"['Clint', 'Eastwoods', 'dark', 'almost', 'gothic', 'interpretation', 'historical', 'source', 'material', 'Changeling', 'audacious', 'devotion', 'fact', 'insistence', 'telling', 'three', 'stories', 'once', 'techniques', 'work', 'degree', 'resulting', 'rich', 'production', 'unfairly', 'neglected', '2009', 'Awards', 'Season', 'Typically', 'exactly', 'sort', 'critical', 'epic', 'would', 'win', 'art-house', 'audiences', 'keep', 'historians', 'busy', 'days', 'almost', 'thoroughly', 'sacrifices', 'attempt', 'commercial', 'success', 'point', 'made', 'more', 'evident', 'sombre', 'almost', 'dreamlike', 'pace', 'film', 'center', 'true', 'story', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'who', 'focal', 'point', 'driving', 'force', 'entire', 'motion', 'picture', 'Ably', 'portrayed', 'Jolie', 'performance', 'decidedly', 'one-note', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'want', 'MY', 'son', 'back', 'insipid', 'lead', 'actress', 'hard', 'invest', 'role', 'exact', 'amount', 'fortitude', 'defiance', 'grit', ""'actress-driven"", 'role', 'Eastwood', 'much', 'material', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'gratuitous', 'mental', 'asylum', 'scene', 'course', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'reminded', 'Collins', 'indeed', 'played', 'Jolie', 'here', 'almost', 'white-faced', 'foundation', 'omnipresent', 'red', 'lip-color', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'turn', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Jolie', 'spirited', 'performance', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'oft-practiced', 'slow-speech', 'phonetic', 'mechanism', 'infuse', 'character', 'charm', 'humor', 'perhaps', 'films', 'only', 'positive', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'rest', 'movie', 'label', 'male', 'institutions', 'intrinsically', 'flawed', 'even', 'evil', 'interconnected', 'storylines', 'quest', 'serial', 'killer', 'corruption', 'police', 'department', 'hunt', 'missing', 'child', 'are', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'standout', 'storyline', 'insistence', 'parent', 'child', 'not', 'theirs', 'Memorable', 'scenes', 'are', 'many', 'primarily', 'involving', 'Collins', 'being', 'questioned', 'psychiatrist', 'where', 'effectively', 'reverse', 'questioning', 'mechanism', 'prove', 'fact', 'insane', 'liar', 'Collins', 'final', 'encounter', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'son', 'critical', 'high', 'moment', 'Jolie', '.Eastwoods', 'lush', '1920s-influenced', 'Jazz', 'score', 'adequate', 'running', 'motif', 'background', 'instrumentation', 'working', 'favor', 'slice', 'Americana', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'second', 'wondrous', 'script', 'historical', 'data', 'actual', 'courtroom', 'transcripts', 'reviewer', 'once', 'said', 'something', 'here', 'everyone', 'part', 'true', 'Changeling', 'demanding', 'motion', 'picture', 'when', 'up', 'almost', 'breathless', 'velocity', 'most', 'part', 'quiet', 'sedentary', 'relying', 'primarily', 'dialogue', 'drive', 'story', 'forward.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'made', 'few', 'better', 'films', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'achievements', 'once', 'Jolie', 'thoroughly', 'absorbed', 'role', 'last', 'time', 'witnessed', 'was', 'Beyond', 'Borders', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'downside', 'star', 'far', 'bigger', 'character', 'playing', 'ever', 'film', 'world', '1928', 'was', 'perhaps', 'just', 'bad', 'worse', 'current', 'world', ""'re"", 'living', 'Whether', 'not', 'comfort', 'Changeling', 'challenging', 'engrossing', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewing.Four', 'Half', 'Stars']",Changeling Theatrical Release

When she has to fill in for a sick co-worker on a Saturday, she leaves nine-year-old Walter (Gattlin Griffith) alone.  And when she returns after work, he is gone.With her world turned upside down, she begins the hunt to find him.  When the LAPD in the person of Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) tell her they've found him, she's ecstatic.  However, the boy who steps off the train (Devon Conti) is not her son.  And the police won't believe her.Christine's only ally in trying to get the truth out is the Reverend Brieglab (John Malkovich) who has a local radio program.  Will that be enough to get the corrupt police to do something?  And what has happened to Walter?And yet I almost didn't see this film because it wasn't my normal comedy.  I'm glad I allowed myself to be talked into it.  It was wonderful for a change of pace.Between the mystery of what happened to Walter and the injustices that Christine faces, this is a riveting movie.  I was glued to the screen the entire running time and still can't believe it is over two hours.The film looked like old film noir pieces with lots of muted colors.  The exception to that rule was Christine's lipstick, which is almost always bright red.  Clint Eastwood did as great a job with the music as he did the directing.  His compositions fit the film beautifully.I must give special praise to Devon Conti who gave his performance as the fake Walter a slightly creepy edge that fit the movie perfectly.  Angelina Jolie was great as our lead, except in her more emotional scenes.  Crying while trying not to cry just didn't work for me.My only other complaint was some timeline issues at the end, but I can't say too much more without spoiling anything.Adults looking for a moving drama will enjoy this film.",4,A Period Piece and a Mystery All in One,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,1870,"['1928', 'single', 'mom', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'face', 'parent', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'When', 'fill', 'sick', 'co-worker', 'Saturday', 'nine-year-old', 'Walter', 'Gattlin', 'Griffith', 'alone', 'when', 'work', 'gone.With', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'hunt', 'find', 'When', 'LAPD', 'person', 'Captain', 'Jones', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'found', 'ecstatic', 'However', 'boy', 'who', 'train', 'Devon', 'Conti', 'not', 'son', 'police', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'her.Christine', 'only', 'ally', 'trying', 'get', 'truth', 'out', 'Reverend', 'Brieglab', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'local', 'radio', 'program', 'Will', 'be', 'enough', 'get', 'corrupt', 'police', 'do', 'something', 'happened', 'Walter', 'yet', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'normal', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'glad', 'allowed', 'be', 'talked', 'was', 'wonderful', 'change', 'pace.Between', 'mystery', 'what', 'happened', 'Walter', 'injustices', 'Christine', 'riveting', 'movie', 'was', 'glued', 'screen', 'entire', 'running', 'time', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'two', 'hours.The', 'film', 'looked', 'old', 'film', 'noir', 'pieces', 'lots', 'muted', 'colors', 'exception', 'rule', 'was', 'Christine', 'lipstick', 'almost', 'always', 'bright', 'red', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'music', 'did', 'directing', 'compositions', 'fit', 'film', 'beautifully.I', 'must', 'give', 'special', 'praise', 'Devon', 'Conti', 'who', 'gave', 'performance', 'fake', 'Walter', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'edge', 'fit', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'was', 'great', 'lead', 'more', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'Crying', 'trying', 'not', 'cry', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.My', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'was', 'timeline', 'issues', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'spoiling', 'anything.Adults', 'looking', 'moving', 'drama', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film']",Changeling Theatrical Release
1158924,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00188M5TM,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[3, 3]","In CHANGELING, director/producer Clint Eastwood has proven yet again what he has emphasized in nearly all of his films as a director or actor: that the human spirit can be bent but need not be broken.  Eastwood has taken a true to life story of a boy's kidnapping and from that (which is certainly horrifying enough) adds a lifting of the rock examination of the underside of a corrupt LA police force in 1928.  This mixture of the boy's abduction added to the sleazy side of real world police corruption forms two sides of a damning socio-political triangle that has an entrenched male chauvinism as the prickly third side.Angelina Jolie is a single mother trying  to raise her son and is doing a creditable job.  She works as a phone company supervisor and is told by her boss that women are rarely trusted with such a position but he likes her spirit and wants her to be promoted to manager.  She stays late at work and returns home to find her son missing.  The police are less than helpful.  Rather, it is the media, led by an evangelist (John Malkovich) who try to find him even if it means exposing the cesspool that is the LAPD.  After six months, the LAPD locate him and return him to his mother amidst great fanfare.  The problem is that she declares that the boy is not hers.  The police chief insists that she is wrong.  Even after the boy's dentist and teacher back up her claim, the police chief is adamant.  What we soon learn about this chief of police is that he is corrupt to his shoelaces and wants only to close this case that Jolie insists remain open.The viewer sees the underside of a society that is more interested in maintaining the profitable status quo than in achieving true justice.  An equally corrupt police captain illegally declares the mother mentally ill and consigns her to a mental institution where she quickly learns the Rules of the Game: do as you're told and do not complain.  There are several scenes of brutish treatment of female inmates by matrons who are early versions of Nurse Ratchet from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.  Even after the police locate the boy's abductor and find a mass burial ground of his victims, both the police chief and captain insist that they were merely following standard operating procedures.  The climax occurs when the mother confronts her son's abductor in prison and grabs him, shouting: ""Did you kill my son?""  Several reviewers have objected to what seems like a rather lengthy denouement, which concludes with the trial, the execution of the condemned, and the playing out of the details concerning whether her boy yet lives. But this I think is precisely Eastwood's point.  Far too often, justice is a messy affair and only in Perry Mason type dramas is the loose ending so neatly tied up.  Too often, as in CHANGELING, are human feelings bashed and crushed by a society that is either uncaring or criminal.  Yet, Eastwood goes to great pains to show that even in a mother's worst nightmare, there are good people like the reverend and a kindly female inmate, both of whom risk their lives to help.  Sometimes, a messy or overdue ending is needed to show that.",5,Changeling: Never Give Up,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,3147,"['CHANGELING', 'director/producer', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'proven', 'yet', 'again', 'what', 'emphasized', 'nearly', 'films', 'director', 'actor', 'human', 'spirit', 'can', 'be', 'bent', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'broken', 'Eastwood', 'taken', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'boy', 'kidnapping', 'certainly', 'horrifying', 'enough', 'lifting', 'rock', 'examination', 'underside', 'corrupt', 'LA', 'police', 'force', '1928', 'mixture', 'boy', 'abduction', 'added', 'sleazy', 'side', 'real', 'world', 'police', 'corruption', 'forms', 'two', 'sides', 'damning', 'socio-political', 'triangle', 'entrenched', 'male', 'chauvinism', 'prickly', 'third', 'side.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'single', 'mother', 'trying', 'raise', 'son', 'doing', 'creditable', 'job', 'phone', 'company', 'supervisor', 'told', 'boss', 'women', 'are', 'rarely', 'trusted', 'position', 'spirit', 'be', 'promoted', 'manager', 'late', 'work', 'home', 'find', 'son', 'missing', 'police', 'are', 'less', 'helpful', 'Rather', 'media', 'led', 'evangelist', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'even', 'exposing', 'cesspool', 'LAPD', 'six', 'months', 'LAPD', 'locate', 'return', 'mother', 'amidst', 'great', 'fanfare', 'problem', 'boy', 'not', 'hers', 'police', 'chief', 'wrong', 'Even', 'boy', 'dentist', 'teacher', 'back', 'claim', 'police', 'chief', 'adamant', 'What', 'soon', 'learn', 'chief', 'police', 'corrupt', 'shoelaces', 'only', 'close', 'case', 'Jolie', 'remain', 'open.The', 'viewer', 'underside', 'society', 'more', 'interested', 'maintaining', 'profitable', 'status', 'quo', 'achieving', 'true', 'justice', 'equally', 'corrupt', 'police', 'captain', 'illegally', 'mother', 'mentally', 'ill', 'mental', 'institution', 'where', 'quickly', 'Rules', 'Game', 'do', ""'re"", 'told', 'do', 'not', 'complain', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'brutish', 'treatment', 'female', 'inmates', 'matrons', 'who', 'are', 'early', 'versions', 'Nurse', 'Ratchet', 'ONE', 'FLEW', 'THE', 'CUCKOO', 'NEST', 'Even', 'police', 'locate', 'boy', 'abductor', 'find', 'mass', 'burial', 'ground', 'victims', 'police', 'chief', 'captain', 'insist', 'were', 'merely', 'following', 'standard', 'operating', 'procedures', 'climax', 'when', 'mother', 'son', 'abductor', 'prison', 'grabs', 'shouting', 'Did', 'kill', 'son', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'objected', 'what', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'denouement', 'trial', 'execution', 'condemned', 'playing', 'details', 'concerning', 'boy', 'yet', 'think', 'precisely', 'Eastwood', 'point', 'Far', 'too', 'often', 'justice', 'messy', 'affair', 'only', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'type', 'dramas', 'loose', 'ending', 'so', 'neatly', 'tied', 'up', 'Too', 'often', 'CHANGELING', 'are', 'human', 'feelings', 'bashed', 'crushed', 'society', 'uncaring', 'criminal', 'Eastwood', 'great', 'pains', 'show', 'even', 'mother', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'are', 'good', 'people', 'reverend', 'kindly', 'female', 'inmate', 'whom', 'risk', 'lives', 'help', 'Sometimes', 'messy', 'overdue', 'ending', 'needed', 'show']",Changeling Theatrical Release

Winslet disrobes - often, Streep brings nothing new as the manchurian rendition devil wearing a habit and Hathaway has smeared mascara.  As the manipulated, distraught and aggrieved single mother, Christine Collins, Jolie embodies the essence of any parent's primary concern, in any era.Changeling is based on a true story of child abduction in ""flapper"" era Los Angeles with emphasis on the corruption within the police force and mayoral office that precluded any genuine effort to meet the actual needs of the constituency. Initially, Collins' pleas for responsiveness are ignored. Only after the authorities recognize an opportunity to use her in the effort to partially rehabilitate their public image does she find any level of assistance. When a child is identified that generally fit the description of her missing son, he is brought to L.A. and immediately, she realizes the child in front of her is not her biological son. In the prevailing environment the police, most noticeably the detective in charge of her case, Captain J.J. Jones, have no intention of allowing parental instinct - or forensic evidence - derail their haphazardly tracked locomotive to a potential partial restoration of public trust. She eventually finds an ally/advocate in the person of Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), an activist minister who had been on the campaign to clean up L.A.'s corrupt political and governmental entities.For me, Clint Eastwood's direction has been often hit or miss, I have a personal preference for films where he stays behind the camera instead of in front of it although I acknowledge Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby run contrary to that view.

1158927,A1II8I66S9E84Y,B00188M5TM,Maureen R. Tagliaferro,"[3, 3]","As it started in 1928, this film did an excellent job of recreating an era reminiscent of our parents' and/or grandparents' time.  It was the good old days of model-T fords, switchboard operators, and steel wheel roller skates in a time when role models were structured, the air was purer, and life was sweeter.  Unfortunately, it was also a time before nation-wide Amber alerts, a time when shock treatment was standard for psychiatric patients, and when authority went basically unopposed.This was the setting of Angelina Jolie's surroundings in what was a well-deserved academy award nominated performance of the real life Christine Collins, a woman whom the L.A. Police returned the wrong kidnapped son.  In spite of overwhelming evidence supporting Collins' objections, the chief of police insisted she was over-reacting from the traumatic experience of the kidnapping and had her committed to a mental hospital.  Better that than admitting the possibility that she was right and they were wrong.As a single parent who was also a career woman, Christine Collins was ahead of her time.  So was the radical, but compassionate minister who fortunately was interested in her case.  Together they managed to release her and all the other wrongfully admitted patients who were also committed to the hospital by the power of police brutality.  They brought down the police force in court, giving the story an uplifting ending, leading the way for hope.For the realistic portrayal of the times, the horror of the events, and the acting from Jolie down to her youngest co-stars, this is a classic portrayal of a true-life event.  Viewers could walk away wondering how much things have changed and how much they stayed the same.  There's still abuse of power and wrongfully accused and committed victims, but more importantly, there's still the possibility that a few strong and dedicated people standing up for what is right can still make a difference.",5,Ahead of It's Time,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1949,"['started', '1928', 'film', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'recreating', 'era', 'reminiscent', 'parents', 'and/or', 'grandparents', 'time', 'was', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'model-T', 'fords', 'switchboard', 'operators', 'steel', 'wheel', 'roller', 'time', 'when', 'role', 'models', 'were', 'structured', 'air', 'was', 'purer', 'life', 'was', 'sweeter', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'nation-wide', 'Amber', 'alerts', 'time', 'when', 'shock', 'treatment', 'was', 'standard', 'psychiatric', 'patients', 'when', 'authority', 'went', 'basically', 'unopposed.This', 'was', 'setting', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'surroundings', 'was', 'well-deserved', 'academy', 'award', 'nominated', 'performance', 'real', 'life', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'woman', 'whom', 'L.A.', 'Police', 'returned', 'wrong', 'kidnapped', 'son', 'spite', 'overwhelming', 'evidence', 'supporting', 'Collins', 'objections', 'chief', 'police', 'insisted', 'was', 'over-reacting', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'kidnapping', 'had', 'committed', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Better', 'admitting', 'possibility', 'was', 'right', 'were', 'wrong.As', 'single', 'parent', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'career', 'woman', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'was', 'radical', 'compassionate', 'minister', 'who', 'fortunately', 'was', 'interested', 'case', 'Together', 'managed', 'release', 'other', 'wrongfully', 'admitted', 'patients', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'committed', 'hospital', 'power', 'police', 'brutality', 'brought', 'down', 'police', 'force', 'court', 'giving', 'story', 'uplifting', 'ending', 'leading', 'way', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'times', 'horror', 'events', 'acting', 'Jolie', 'down', 'youngest', 'co-stars', 'classic', 'portrayal', 'true-life', 'event', 'Viewers', 'could', 'walk', 'away', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'how', 'much', 'stayed', 'same', 'still', 'abuse', 'power', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'committed', 'victims', 'more', 'importantly', 'still', 'possibility', 'few', 'strong', 'dedicated', 'people', 'standing', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'difference']",Changeling Theatrical Release

1158929,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00188M5TM,Melissa Niksic,"[3, 4]","""Changeling"" is every bit as good as I expected it to be. With Angelina Jolie as the star and Clint Eastwood as the director, how can you go wrong? The film, which is based on a true story, revolves around Christine Collins (Jolie), whose nine-year-old son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), disappears one day in March 1928. After several months, the Los Angeles Police Department claims to have found the child, but the boy they return to Christine is not Walter, and she can't get them to listen to her when she tries to explain there's been a horrible mistake. Christine's insistence becomes a major thorn in the side of the police captain (Jeffrey Donovan), who sneakily (and illegally) has Christine locked away in a mental hospital. Eventually the truth about the police misconduct in the Collins case is revealed for the world to see, and Christine continues to hope that her real son may still be out there somewhere.This is an excellent film with an astounding cast. There's a gruesome subplot that ties into the Collins case, causing the film to be a lot more violent and disturbing than I initially expected. ""Changeling"" is also on the long side, clocking in at about two and a half hours. Still, it's a magnificent film, and Jolie delivers one of her most impressive performances to date.

One day, while at work at the telephone company, her son vanishes without a trace.  A nationwide search proves fruitless until, five months later, her ""son"" is located in the Midwest and returned to Los Angeles.The problem is that the kid is not Collins' son, even though the police insist that he is.  After all, it would be very embarrassing to this then very corrupt police department if they'd found the wrong boy, right?When Collins keeps insisting that they've returned the wrong boy to her, the cops arrest her and put her into a mental institution, planning to keep her there until she stops her ""rant"".In the meantime, another detective, working a totally unrelated case, makes a shocking discovery involving a brutal serial killer who may be responsible for the disappearance of Collins' son.Clint Eastwood has directed another powerful motion picture, enhancing his reputation as one of our finest directors.

1158931,A2YFFQQ2100DKO,B00188M5TM,"Michael Giltz ""Michael in New York""","[0, 9]","Clint Eastwood is having a very good year. He may not have been feted at the Oscars, but massive box office is the best revenge. He directed Angelina Jolie to an Oscar nomination in Changeling (Universal; $29.98), the period film about a mother whose son has gone missing, only to find the corrupt LA police have tried to settle media hysteria by saddling her with another little boy and claiming this strange kid is in fact her child. Then Clint directed and starred in Gran Torino, a modest movie about a cranky old racist who finds he has more in common with his ""foreign"" neighbors than his own children. Remarkably, this tiny film has become the biggest hit of Eastwood's career as both an actor and director, with box office at $139 in the US. Yes, the year would have been perfect if Eastwood could have gone to the Oscars and crooned ""Gran Torino,"" the theme song he wrote and performed with Jamie Cullum. I'm not a fan of either movie, unfortunately. Changeling is still-born. Jolie has a fee good scenes when she has to deal with the seeming imposter that the police have forced her to take home. But John Malcovich is miscast as a crusading preacher who wants to help her, fight the cops and loves the spotlight. He seems so slippery I kept waiting for him to betray her in some way. And what is the film about? Corruption? It spends too much time with Jolie. A mother fighting for her child? We can't quite figure out why she takes this kid in, however few rights women had at the time. And then it veers off into serial killer territory, making the film seem like three unsatisfying movies in one. All it made me want to do was rewatch LA Confidential. Gran Torino doesn't have half the ambition of Changeling but isn't even half as (un)interesting. Clint growls so much throughout the film he almost seems to be parodying himself. And most of the unknown actors he is surrounded with simply aren't up to the task. Why this particular film should resonate with audiences is a mystery (his biggest hit adjusted for inflation is the godawful Every Which Way But Loose). But clearly Clint has hit icon status -- if Clint wants to make a movie about a cranky old man sitting alone on a porch, Warner Bros. would be foolish to say no. And hearing Clint speak-sing parts of the song ""Gran Torino"" sent me back to one of his less-appreciated gems, Honkeytonk Man, the moving story of a dying country and western singer who gets one final chance to record some music. That's not in Clint Eastwood: American Icon Collection ($19.98; Universal), but four offbeat films are -- and at a bargain price. You get Eastwood's directorial debut Play Misty For Me, which made a respectable $10 million back in 1971 but which Clint told David Letterman he remembers as a box office flop which might have been his only time directing if the French hadn't championed it. You also get the so-so action film The Eiger Sanction, the fun Coogan's Bluff (which turned into the hit TV series McCloud and the very atypical Civil War flick The Beguiled, which has wounded Clint recuperating at an all girl's school. It's slowly paced and I hated it when I was a little boy in the hospital and that was the only thing on TV, but it has its fans and it's about time I gave it another shot.

1158932,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00188M5TM,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","Changeling is most famous for being produced by Clint Eastwood and its lead actress, Angelina Jolie.  Those two names unfortunately overshadow a disturbing true tale of one woman's struggle to find her son.The film follows Christine Collins (Jolie), a single mother rising in the ranks of the 1920s workforce in Los Angeles.  When the hectic workday demands of single parenthood conspire against her, Collins is forced to leave her son Walter alone at home.  And then Walter disappears.But that's not the story.  Changeling focuses on what happens to Collins afterwards.  The LAPD, under increasing pressure for its thuggish behavior, is desperate for an easy PR-win. When a child comes forward claiming to be Walter, the LAPD publicly declares the case solved.  There's just one problem: it's not Walter.What happens next is a heartbreaking tale of male-dominated institutions bringing their full weight to bear against a single mother without family, friends, or resources.  Fortunately, her plight gains the attention of Reverend Gustav Briegleb (the always superb John Malkovich), who uses Collins as part of his public chess game with the LAPD. As tensions escalate and Collins continues to deny the faux Walter as her real son, she is committed to a mental institution to shut her up. The story would end there, if it weren't for evidence that Walter was murdered by Gordon Stewart Northcott.The status of Jolie as an object of male lust often obscures her acting ability, and it is all the more evident here, where she plays a meek woman who only wants the police to find her son.  Her nemesis is Captain J. J. Jones, played by Jeffrey Donovan, he of Burn Notice fame.  Donovan seems a little uncomfortable in the role; he slips in and out of his Irish accent and he doesn't always exhibit the hard-edged indifference that makes the character so loathsome.Changeling's author is the eponymous J. Michael Straczynski, most famous for Babylon 5 but also a scriptwriter for numerous cartoons, Jake and the Fatman, Murder She Wrote, and Walker Texas Ranger.  Straczynski knows how to spin an investigative yarn and his attention to detail shows in the film.  This is as much a commentary on the changing role of technology, media, and women in American society as it is a historical tale.  Oddly, some attributes are glossed over: Northcott's mother is notably missing, as is the fact that many of the political and legal improvements made at the conclusion of the film were ultimately reversed.None of that detracts from the tale.  Whenever a child is endangered, every parent can't help but be alternately terrified and enthralled.  We keep hoping for a happy resolution, knowing that it will never come.

As a movie about the ability of a few remarkable individuals to change history, it is more than successful; it excels. Staring Angelina Jolie and directed by Clint Eastwood, this is a film whose cumulative message about justice overcoming corrupt systems of power is both moving and persuasive. However, the message of the film isn't delivered like a heavy-handed morality play, but through an emotionally evocative performance by Jolie, as well her remarkable supporting cast. The fact that the story on which the film is based is true is icing on the cake.Jolie is Christine Collins, a single, working mother who is devoted to her son. Arriving home from work to find him missing, she contacts the LAPD and spends the next few months in a desperate search for her boy. When the LAPD announces they have found him and he is delivered to her via train, she quickly realizes that the boy they've brought is not hers, despite his and the entire police force's insistence that he is. The rest of the film is about her fight for answers from corrupt and pompous police officials, politicians, and doctors. Harrowing, sad, and at times disturbing, her pursuit of the truth is heart wrenching.One of the elements that really makes this movie as good as it is are the excellent performances turned in the the supporting cast. Especially worth mentioning are John Malkovitch as the Reverend Briegleb, a crusading Presbyterian pastor who uses his daily radio show to speak truth to power, and Michael Kelly as Detective Ybarra, seemingly the only honest police officer in the LAPD. Kelly does a fantastic job portraying both hardness and compassion in equal measure. There are scenes where he really makes the shot, such as the moment when he gently comforts a young boy in one of the most gripping moments in the film. Malkovitch is of course outstanding, and he steals most of the shots he appears in, conveying righteous anger without religious fervor, a very nice change from the typical cliches assigned members of the clergy.The period pieces and art direction are all very well done, which is typical of Eastwood who is having a good year with the success of Gran Torino and this film. The interiors of the police station, hospital, and courtroom all feel spot on, and contribute to making this movie immersive on more than an emotional level.A few caveats I had with the film were surrounding its length and the use of dialogue. Eastwood normally doesn't have many waste shots in his films, but I thought there were a number of times that the momentum slowed unnecessarily. I think the movie could have lost 20 minutes or so and been even stronger. I also feel that some of the dialogue was a bit forced or over done, especially some of the scenes that takes place in the hospital and then later in the courtroom. However these minor complaints do little to mar this excellent film.4.5/5 Stars. Stands withL.A.

1158943,A3TSPLFYU2UMW0,B00188M5TM,nicjaytee,"[1, 3]","""Changeling"" is a gripping and at times deeply uncomfortable film that will grab your attention throughout most of its two hours & twenty minutes, which is some commendation on its own. And, it's a genuinely true story - a rare claim for a film to make but one that's fundamental to its power in keeping you glued to the screen.But is it? Well there's little doubt that most of the key facts presented in the film are true and, if you've seen it, check out the more reliable internet articles covering the case's source material to confirm this (and, if you haven't, don't read them or the rest of this review until afterwards unless you want to spoil the full impact of the film).So, where's the problem? Well, a key premise of ""Changeling"" is that the Los Angeles Police Department, a deeply corrupt organisation at the time, used and then abused a missing boy's mother, Christine Collins, for their own ends. And, beneath this there's a pretty overt implication that the imposition on her of a conveniently available ""look alike"" for her missing son was, from the outset, a cynical set-up by the LAPD simply to gain positive publicity. All of which may be a perfectly true interpretation of events.Or maybe not... for the source information on the case reveals some important elements relating to it that the film omits or glosses over but which could change your view on what actually went on here. First off, it omits the fact that Walter Collins' disappearance was widely reported in the press, including photographs of him and repeated claims by his mother that he'd been kidnapped. Next, it glosses over the background of the boy who pretended to be him: someone who subsequently appears never to have changed his story that he knew of the ""kidnapping"" and that, after he'd been told how much he looked like the photos of the boy in the papers, decided on his own volition to impersonate him as a way of getting to Hollywood to meet his favourite movie star. Then, it omits some key facts concerning the imposter: for example, the fact that prior to meeting him Christine Collins had, from photographs, positively identified him to the police as being her son; that he was emaciated because of his poor background; that he was unusually convincing in the role, claiming that he'd been kidnapped & interned and that in addition to losing weight because of this he'd lost some of his memory after being hit on the head by his abductors; and that, because of his emaciated state, his facial similarity and his skill in lying, he convinced a number of people who'd known Walter Collins that he was genuine. None of which comes out in the film.It is, of course, quite possible that the LAPD did indeed set-up the whole thing; but, it's also quite possible that, presented with someone who looked like the missing boy, who span a convincing story about his disappearance & condition, and who others believed to be him, the police genuinely thought they'd got the right person. And, if so, it's also possible that they had some basis, at least initially, for believing that Christine Collins' refusal to accept him as her real son was a result of his emaciation and her traumatised state. Maybe not, but this missing information does suggest that there's more than one interpretation of the reasons behind this quite bizarre sequence of events.All very odd, particularly as the inclusion of this information would have made the film much more believable. For example, why cast the imposter as a healthy, almost chubby child when his emaciation was a key reason why he could successfully impersonate Walter Collins to both the police and others who'd known him? And, why not show Christine Collins identifying him as her son from photos when, without this, you're left with the obvious question of why didn't the police or indeed anyone else compare photos of the two boys? Maybe its inclusion might make you question whether the LAPD was quite as bad as it's portrayed to be throughout the film, thereby robbing it of some of its undoubted impact, but then again, there's enough genuinely horrific and genuinely true facts in it - including Christine Collins' short internment by the police in a mental institution and it's highly accurate recounting of the whole story of Gordon Northrop and the ""chicken coop"" murders - to make it a sufficiently powerful and shocking film on its own.Whatever the reasons for these fairly fundamental omissions the end result is that ""Changeling"" is not actually what it claims to be: it's not a genuinely ""true"" story, rather a powerfully effective dramatisation of one of several possible interpretations of what happened that relies on your belief that it's genuine for it to work.

It's hard to believe that this type of thing actually happened not all that many years ago.  Angelina Jolie plays a mother, Christine Collins, whose nine-year-old son, Walter, disappeared in March of 1928, seemingly into thin air.  The frustration and the run around she gets from a corrupt L.A. police department makes you wonder how something like that could have happened.  And the psychiatrist and people working at the mental hospital later on in the movie are almost worse.  It's almost hard to remember a time when women were treated so poorly by men in power.  The acting was superb.  There wasn't a wink link in the whole cast.  By the end of the movie there are so many people involved in the cover-up that you wonder if anyone in charge is actually honest.  Unfortunately, things like this probably happen more often than we are aware.The other thing I really liked about the movie was all the sets and wardrobe.  The little details made this movie that much more interesting and believable.  Clint Eastwood did a wonderful job of directing and truly captured the feeling of the period.

That was the best movie of that year and like Forrest Gump it shouldve cleaned house.

When she returns she cant find him anywhere so she files a police report and tries for the police to help her but at that time, the police didnt want to look bad so they put her in a psychiatric ward because she made public that the police failed to help her finding her son.It narrows down that a man in the 30s killed 19 kids and one of the kids that escaped came forward to tell the tale. The kid mentioned he saw Angelina's son as this man massacred kids sometimes 5 at a time.With the help of an attorney, Angelina files a lawsuit against the police dept and not only the killer was sentenced to die by hanging but unfortunately Angelina was never able to recover from the loss of her son.Is a great movie with a lot of substance that again it was treated by the wayside!!!",5,ANGELINA JOLIE and CLINT EASTWOOD = A Winning Team!,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,1611,"['year', '2008', 'was', 'year', 'where', 'where', 'FIASCO', 'Movies', 'one', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'OSCARS', 'Angelina', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'female', 'actress', 'didnt', 'get', 'Oscar', 'what', 'shame', 'were', 'treated', 'wayside.The', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'suffered', 'same', 'fate', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'shouldve', 'cleaned', 'house', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'was', 'given', 'Sean', 'Pean', 'movie', 'called', 'MILK', 'can', 'find', 'now', 'Walmart', '5', 'guess', 'wanted', 'get', 'good', 'Gay', 'community', 'Oscars', 'MILK', 'cant', 'touch', 'Benjamin', 'Button.To', 'surprise', 'many', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood.PLOT', 'movie', 'place', '20s', 'Angelina', 'phone', 'operator', 'supervisor', 'son', 'home', 'work', 'When', 'cant', 'find', 'anywhere', 'so', 'police', 'report', 'tries', 'police', 'help', 'time', 'police', 'didnt', 'want', 'look', 'bad', 'put', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'made', 'public', 'police', 'failed', 'help', 'finding', 'son.It', 'down', 'man', '30s', 'killed', '19', 'kids', 'one', 'kids', 'escaped', 'came', 'forward', 'tell', 'tale', 'kid', 'mentioned', 'saw', 'Angelina', 'son', 'man', 'massacred', 'kids', 'sometimes', '5', 'time.With', 'help', 'attorney', 'Angelina', 'lawsuit', 'police', 'dept', 'not', 'only', 'killer', 'was', 'sentenced', 'die', 'hanging', 'unfortunately', 'Angelina', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'recover', 'loss', 'son.Is', 'great', 'movie', 'lot', 'substance', 'again', 'was', 'treated', 'wayside']",Changeling Theatrical Release

This is a story about a mother who comes home from work one day to discover that her son is missing.  It is during an era when the LAPD was known more for its thorough corruption than for solving crimes.  Christine persists in pressuring them to find her son and her plight takes on mass appeal.  The police produce a boy after five months and the boy himself claims to be her son, Walter.  But, is he? Christine refuses to accept this child as her own son,  and the guts of the tale is how she fights and what she goes through to make her case.The Christine Collins case had dramatic impact on the LAPD.  Several key officers were forced into retirement and citizens' rights received protection such that no one could be thrown into a mental ward based on the whims of the police.  ""LA Confidential"" is another movie about the police corruption in Los Angeles in the same era and features many of the same real-life personalities.Jolie was nominated for best actress based on this performance and deserved that Oscar nod.

Michael Straczinski was given some info about a horrible case involving the LA police during the late 1920's. Using this info, he crafted a riveting screenplay to expose a true situation that many aren't aware of. I agree with some previous reviewers who said that the last half-hour wasn't really necessary, creating red herrings that weren't fully resolved.  In the hands of director Clint Eastwood, with an amazing crew that recreated LA in the 1920's to the letter, this isn't that major a flaw. Ms. Jolie is confident and powerful, avoiding a lot of histrionic clich&eacute;s that might've been. It's a great performance. She is the absolute center of this film. There are terrific and complete supporting roles by John Malkovich as a crusading preacher, and Colm Feore as an arrogant police chief. The small but powerful appearance by Amy Ryan is amazing, giving Jolie's character the grit to survive. Jeffrey Donovan is excellent as one of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen, a police captain who seems to hold the reins. Also fine is Michael Kelly, as, perhaps, the only good cop in the film. Without giving anything away, watch for a magnificent performance by Jason Butler Harner as a delusional sicko. Yes, it probably didn't have to be so long, but watching the wonderful actors under Mr. Eastwood's guidance is worth it. It's a true story that somewhat went ""under the radar"", since the Great Depression was rife with corruption and crazy people. The DVD extras are minimal, but interesting.

I admit it, I haven't started the list of Oscar winners until I saw ""Changeling"" and I definitely think this film should be on the ballot for more than the Best Picture nod.In brief, the story is based on a true life account about a single mom in the 1920's  who regretfully leaves her young son Walter home when she goes to work at the telephone company and returns to find he is gone.  She calls the LAPD and is told she must wait 24 hours to file a report.  After all, ""Most of the kids come back by breakfast,"" and later in the phone call, ""by noon.""When she continues to press the LAPD for help, they return a young boy who is circumcised and three inches shorter to her and tell her he's her son.  At that time, their best criminal experts all agree on that and the doctor even says ""several months of trauma can shrink a kid's spine.""Angelina Jolie plays single mom, Christine Collins.  She's strong, she's earnest, and she doesn't quit.  Unfortunately, in the 1920's those traits can land a woman in a mental institution.This is not an escape film; however, it's a superlative example of how period pieces should be done.  Everything from the plug-in switchboard, to the fashions is right on.  Clint Eastwood does a superlative job directing and J.

1158964,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00188M5TM,RMurray847,"[5, 7]","The true story of Christine Collins, as presented in Clint Eastwood's CHANGELING, is a supremely compelling slice of American history.  I was surprised that I had never really heard of the case...but from what I've read about it since seeing the movie, it sounds like the whole thing was going to slip into a national distant memory.  It's very exciting that this case has now been captured for posterity.  Frankly, the story feels a little bit like what an adaptation of the non-fiction book DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY might feel like.  An unusual and nearly forgotten crossroads of two fascinating bits of Americana.The year is 1928, and Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single-mother raising her 9 year old son in Los Angeles.  She works as a floor manager in a telephone operator center.  She's good at her job, respected by the woman and men around her...but it's clear her life revolves around giving her young son a solid life.  They live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood.  They use very convenient public transportation to go to work and school.  They get along well, and the boy seems to be studious and polite.  It's a rosy picture...but there's no reason not to believe it.  One day, Collins must go to work on a weekend unexpectedly, and she leaves her son Walter at home alone.  (This was not nearly as ""irresponsible"" then as it would be today.)  She comes home that evening, and her son is gone, without a trace.The police are not very helpful, but amazingly, after a few months, she gets word that her son has been found in DeKalb, Illinois and is on his way back.  The police, anxious for a bit of good publicity, arrange for the press to be at the station in droves when mother & son are reunited.  But when the happy moment comes, Christine insists that the boy greeting her is NOT her son.Her campaign to compel the police to continue looking for her son is what drives much of this film.  Apparently, at this time in Los Angeles, the police were as corrupt as any group of mobsters and twice as murderous.  If a man needed to be silenced, he'd be killed.  If a woman needed to learn to shut up, she was committed to an insane asylum.  Christine's saga is sure to stir any viewers outrage and disbelief.In the background of this sensational case, we follow the journey of one plodding but honest enough detective, who eventually uncovers the fate of young Walter and a number of other missing boys.  It is this investigation and the subsequent events of it that elevate this from an interesting but somewhat familiar film to a story that is almost too good to be believed.When Christine's plight collides with this detective's discoveries and then they collide again with a corrupt police force...this is when you shake your head and wonder how it is you've not heard this story before.  If someone were to write a novel like this...we'd smile at how much they were stretching credulity.So, just to experience the story alone makes CHANGELING a must-see.  Simple as that.Too bad the movie itself isn't a little better.  It is 2 hours and 20 minutes long, and while I do not mind long movies at all, I felt that Eastwood's always stately pace was just a mite too glacial.  I would have liked to lose 10 minutes.  Nothing major...just a little tightening.  Many critics of the film complain that it has too many endings.  It IS true that the film follows virtually every bit of the case to their conclusions...and this leads to a film without a true climax.  But frankly, the story is inherently compelling enough that the lack of that one ""wow"" moment was okay.  I was glad he took the time to show us what happened years later...rather than simply show a title card with a quick sentence telling us how it all turned out.  (There is some of that...but only after all the meat of the story has played out.)In addition, I found the acting spotty at best.  Jeffrey Donovan plays the detective who most vehemently stands in Christine's way.  His character is one-dimensionally constructed, and Donovan struggles to add layers to it.  John Malkovich is given the character of an activist minister who uses Christine to wage his battle against the police...and while it's a less manic performance from Malkovich than we usually get...it also feels a bit devoid of energy and life.  He feels like a dramatic device...even though he may have really existed.  On the other hand, Michael Kelly as Detective Ybarra, who cracks the case gives a suitably understated and yet charismatic performance.  And I have a soft spot for Colm Feore, who plays the Chief of Police, ever since his great work in the Stephen King TV movie ""Storm of the Century.""And what of Jolie?  There's no doubt she throws her all into the part.  She is a compelling presence, and it's the kind of performance that frequently inspires Oscar nominations.  But I actually found her a bit tiring to watch at times.  She so often resorts to thumping her chest and proclaiming in a despair-wracked, gravelly voice, ""I want MY son!!  I want my SON!!  I WANT my son!!!""  The role is quietly flashy (good) but also not very nuanced (not so good).  I believe ultimately it is the script that has betrayed her...but sometimes Jolie also just seems to self-aware of what a striking figure she is in her period costumes and her sensual lips.The film is great to look at.  The recreation of suburban LA, with red trolley cars running right down quiet neighborhood streets is a treat.  The costumes are great and the cinematography is suitably unobtrusive.  Almost every frame makes you feel immersed in a particular time and place.Yet it is really only the amazing facts of the story itself that make this film a must-see.  Were the story inherently less compelling, I'd probably only be able to give the film a very marginal thumbs up, due to flaws in pacing and acting and scripting.  As it stands, however, I need to recommend this film highly by virtue of its amazing true tale.",4,"Some flaws, but an ABSOLUTELY compelling true story.",1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,5960,"['true',

""geek hipster""","[10, 20]","Like other reviewers here, I was at once enthralled and disgusted by the miscarriage of justice presented in 'Changeling', a film that depicts mother Christine Collins as a martyr, the LA police as evil and manipulative, and hope a commodity in the light of terrible tragedy.I have 2 problems with the film, one being a large matter of details and another being a small matter or respect. To do so, I have to reference the actual case details, so I have to get into some plotpoints of the film.(Anyone looking for details online can google 'Wineville Chicken-Coop Murders'. It's a well-documented case)*spoiler warning*a collection of historical inaccuracies, in no particular order:1)Christine Collins was a well-to-do mother, not a working girl.2)Walter Collins and the 2 Winslow brothers were proved forensically to have been murdered at the Northcott farm. Their body parts were identified.3)There was no testimony ever indicating there were any escapes from the chicken coop, that Walter Collins heroically risked his life to help other boys, etc.4)Gordon Northcott's mother, Sarah Louise, was convicted for the murder of Walter Collins, to which she confessed.5)It was speculated there were as many of 20 children killed, but it was never proved.6)Arthur Hutchins confessed to not being Walter Collins shortly after Christine Collins was sent to a mental hospital, and she was released 10 days later. He was not coerced by police, but was trying to escape his mother by getting to California.7)for his conduct, Captain Jones was fined $10,800, which he never paid.8)Gordon Northcott was 21 at the time of the murders, not in his 30s.9)There was no dismissal of the chief of police, there was the trial of Gordon Northcott and there was a civil suit by Christine Collins against Captain Jones for damages.From these points it's hard to miss an intent to, for dramatic purposes(for storytelling purposes), to portray Collins as a saint, Captain Jones as misogynistic and evil, Arthur Hutchins as an accomplice to the police, and Gordon Northcott as a lone madman.But Northcott didn't act alone. Mrs. Northcott confessed to killing Walter Collins and spent the rest of her life in San Quentin. Here's a hard question: Was she any less of a good mother to HER son?  You see, that kind of question would complicate the film's story of Christine Collins. The intent of 'Changeling' is not to REALLY tell this story.  It's intent is to KINDOF tell it as a 'Joan of Arc Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' fable, and then wrap it up with a courtroom scene and a message of hope at the end.Look, I don't have a problem with stories about people who are made to suffer through no fault of their own. I do find them most engaging when they manage to inject a little warmth or a little ironic humor, which this film doesn't really manage.I don't have a problem with films injecting a feminist morality into their stories, either.  I think the mistreatment of women is a subject that needs to be brought up again and again, but not at the expense of truth.I DO have a problem with films that want to explore real cases of child abuse and murder, and then lack the conviction to be honest through and through, and raise awareness of the issues... because why in God's name would anyone want to shape a child murder case into a broadly drawn entertainment for the masses- what is the thinking?It's this kindof creepy creative dishonesty in the writing that does a disservice to the real-life victims.  Walter Collins died.  The only hope in his story is that his suffering ended.""Well, it's just a movie,"" right?No, it's a manipulative revision of a really horrific and well-documented true story, shaped into an Oscar-or-bust vehicle for Jolie.

1158969,A1SBRISKS7PH7U,B00188M5TM,Rob,"[6, 7]","Changeling is a gripping movie for adults - 'manna for grown ups' as one reviewer rightly called it. Angelina Jolie turns in a terrific performance as Christine Collins, a demure single mother in 1920's Los Angeles whose missing son becomes a rallying point for the oppressed citizens of LA suffering under the boot of a ruthlessly corrupt police force & mayoralty.But there's a big twist in the tale when, in a parallel storyline, another young boy is arrested on a routine deportation case & does he have a story to tell. A tale so horrifying that it would instantly qualify as every parents worst nightmare. When I saw this film in the cinema the packed out audience gasped - literally gasped out loud - during the scene between the kid & the police officer.Jolie has never been quite this good & she brings a fantastic larger than life movie star presence to her role. She's a terrific actress in the body of a goddess & watching her evokes so much of the spirit of a Rita Hayworth or a Joan Crawford in their luminous prime. But she's not the only star here. One of the great pleasures of Changeling is watching so many unknown character actors given the chance to strut their stuff & boy do they take it.The script is just as outstanding, moving effortlessly from one genre to another - part period crime thriller, part serial killer movie, part psycho ward drama, part courtroom procedural. It begins small & then unexpectedly expands to take in political corruption, the status of women, the way children & adults view the same event, & the satisfaction (or not) of capital punishment. What's most impressive is the way Clint Eastwood orchestrates all of this because Changeling shifts gears so smoothly that one remains completely transfixed, indeed amazed, throughout.There's also a real sense of anger here as Eastwood leaves us in no doubt how he feels about the way Collins - & others like her - were treated by the authorities. As much as Changeling is a hugely enjoyable picture it carries a genuine contemporary resonance as a cautionary tale.Amazon's editorial review suggests the film goes on to long & sags in the final stretch. I couldn't disagree more. In fact I think this is one of the best edited movies I have seen in a long while. The multiple storylines & shifting emotional moods are so well captured by Joel Cox & Gary Roach's editing that they deserved an Oscar nomination. The technical aspects are top notch throughout & how pleasing it is to see a period piece in which the sets & costumes never once overwhelm the characters or the story. Eastwood's lovely score is the icing on the cake.Changeling was the first of two masterful Eastwood movies in 2008, the other being Gran Torino. Both come highly recommended for those hungering for movies the way they used to make 'em (& I mean that in the best possible sense).",5,Takes its place amongst the first rank of Eastwood's work,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,2851,"['Changeling', 'gripping', 'movie', 'adults', ""'manna"", 'grown', 'ups', 'one', 'reviewer', 'rightly', 'called', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'demure', 'single', 'mother', '1920', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'missing', 'son', 'rallying', 'point', 'oppressed', 'citizens', 'LA', 'suffering', 'boot', 'ruthlessly', 'corrupt', 'police', 'force', 'mayoralty.But', 'big', 'twist', 'tale', 'when', 'parallel', 'storyline', 'young', 'boy', 'arrested', 'routine', 'deportation', 'case', 'have', 'story', 'tell', 'tale', 'so', 'horrifying', 'would', 'instantly', 'qualify', 'parents', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'cinema', 'packed', 'out', 'audience', 'gasped', 'literally', 'gasped', 'out', 'loud', 'scene', 'kid', 'police', 'officer.Jolie', 'never', 'been', 'quite', 'good', 'fantastic', 'larger', 'life', 'movie', 'star', 'presence', 'role', 'terrific', 'actress', 'body', 'goddess', 'watching', 'evokes', 'so', 'much', 'spirit', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'luminous', 'prime', 'not', 'only', 'star', 'here', 'One', 'great', 'pleasures', 'Changeling', 'watching', 'so', 'many', 'unknown', 'character', 'actors', 'given', 'chance', 'strut', 'stuff', 'boy', 'do', 'take', 'it.The', 'script', 'just', 'outstanding', 'moving', 'effortlessly', 'one', 'genre', 'part', 'period', 'crime', 'thriller', 'part', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'part', 'psycho', 'ward', 'drama', 'part', 'courtroom', 'procedural', 'small', 'then', 'unexpectedly', 'take', 'political', 'corruption', 'status', 'women', 'way', 'children', 'adults', 'view', 'same', 'event', 'satisfaction', 'not', 'capital', 'punishment', 'What', 'most', 'impressive', 'way', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Changeling', 'shifts', 'gears', 'so', 'smoothly', 'one', 'completely', 'transfixed', 'indeed', 'amazed', 'also', 'real', 'sense', 'anger', 'here', 'Eastwood', 'doubt', 'how', 'way', 'Collins', 'others', 'were', 'treated', 'authorities', 'As', 'much', 'Changeling', 'hugely', 'enjoyable', 'picture', 'genuine', 'contemporary', 'resonance', 'cautionary', 'tale.Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'film', 'long', 'sags', 'final', 'stretch', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'fact', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'edited', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'while', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'shifting', 'emotional', 'moods', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'captured', 'Joel', 'Cox', 'Gary', 'Roach', 'editing', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'how', 'pleasing', 'see', 'period', 'piece', 'sets', 'costumes', 'never', 'once', 'characters', 'story', 'Eastwood', 'lovely', 'score', 'icing', 'cake.Changeling', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'masterful', 'Eastwood', 'movies', '2008', 'other', 'being', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'come', 'highly', 'recommended', 'hungering', 'movies', 'way', 'used', 'make', ""'em"", 'mean', 'best', 'possible', 'sense']",Changeling Theatrical Release

Zwick,"[2, 3]","If ""Changeling"" didn't tell us right up front that it was based on a true story, one might be easily forgiven for dismissing it as nothing more than far-fetched and implausible melodrama.  But since truth so often IS stranger than fiction, we can but sit back in openmouthed disbelief as this most bizarre of bizarre scenarios unfolds before us.Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins, a single mother living with her nine-year-old son, Walter, in 1928 Los Angeles.  When Walter goes missing one day, the frantic mother pleads with the police to find him.  After five long months of grueling suspense, Christine is finally reunited with her child.  Or is she?  For while the police, eager to close the case for publicity purposes, insist that the boy they've found is indeed her missing son, Christine knows otherwise and spends the next few months attempting to convince anyone who'll listen that her real son is still out there somewhere and that the boy living with her is an imposter.  John Malkovich co-stars as a crusading radio preacher who takes up the cause of this understandably distraught mother against the increasingly disreputable and malicious LAPD.Written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also wrote the musical score), ""Changeling"" is a gripping human drama that keeps us on tenterhooks every step of its narrative-shifting way.  Going well beyond the surface fascinations of the plot, the movie broadens out to become a compelling study of police corruption and of one woman's battle for justice against a totalitarian, bureaucratic system.  Throughout, the audience is buffeted back and forth between utter frustration and heartwarming uplift and just about every other emotion in between.  It's true that the movie does have a few too many false climaxes towards the end and there are individual  moments when it veers dangerously close to exploitation, but, for the most part, this is a first-rate, riveting drama, solidly directed by Eastwood and beautifully acted by Jolie, Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan, Amy Ryan and many others.Director Eastwood triumphs again.",4,jaw-dropping true story,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2127,"['Changeling', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'dismissing', 'nothing', 'more', 'far-fetched', 'implausible', 'melodrama', 'truth', 'so', 'often', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'openmouthed', 'disbelief', 'most', 'bizarre', 'bizarre', 'scenarios', 'unfolds', 'us.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'single', 'mother', 'living', 'nine-year-old', 'son', 'Walter', '1928', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'When', 'Walter', 'missing', 'one', 'day', 'frantic', 'mother', 'pleads', 'police', 'find', 'five', 'long', 'months', 'grueling', 'suspense', 'Christine', 'finally', 'reunited', 'child', 'police', 'eager', 'close', 'case', 'publicity', 'purposes', 'insist', 'boy', ""'ve"", 'found', 'indeed', 'missing', 'son', 'Christine', 'otherwise', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'attempting', 'convince', 'anyone', 'who', ""'ll"", 'listen', 'real', 'son', 'still', 'there', 'somewhere', 'boy', 'living', 'imposter', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'co-stars', 'crusading', 'radio', 'preacher', 'who', 'up', 'cause', 'understandably', 'distraught', 'mother', 'increasingly', 'disreputable', 'malicious', 'LAPD.Written', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'musical', 'score', 'Changeling', 'gripping', 'human', 'drama', 'tenterhooks', 'step', 'narrative-shifting', 'way', 'Going', 'well', 'surface', 'fascinations', 'plot', 'movie', 'out', 'become', 'compelling', 'study', 'police', 'corruption', 'one', 'woman', 'battle', 'justice', 'totalitarian', 'bureaucratic', 'system', 'Throughout', 'audience', 'buffeted', 'back', 'forth', 'utter', 'frustration', 'heartwarming', 'uplift', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'emotion', 'true', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'false', 'climaxes', 'end', 'are', 'individual', 'moments', 'when', 'dangerously', 'close', 'exploitation', 'most', 'part', 'first-rate', 'riveting', 'drama', 'solidly', 'directed', 'Eastwood', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Jolie', 'Malkovich', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'many', 'others.Director', 'Eastwood', 'triumphs', 'again']",Changeling Theatrical Release

A captivating historic glimpse of the time period is an attractive feature.  The events are based upon a true story.  However, the power and abuse of the psychiatric profession are grossly exaggerated.  Shock treatments in reality were not used as punishment.  The patient had to have an empty stomach.  Thus, ECT was scheduled for early morning before breakfast to prevent choking. Placing patients in isolation was done only to prevent them from harming themselves or others.

Christine Collins doesn't own a car, and she takes the street car everywhere.  This allows the director to provide glimpses of what L.A. looked like in those days.Her job as a telephone switchboard supervisor provides for more visual images - dozens of women are at work, making the calls go through, plugging wires into a call board, in a world that existed long before cell phones.  How does Christine manage her large floor of employees?  She uses rollerskates to get back and forth across the office.  These small details are essential to recreating the time and the place for those of us who weren't alive back in 1928.The story is based on real events.  Christine's nine-year-old son disappears one Saturday while she's at work, and her life changes forever.  The search for her missing son isn't helped at first by a police department that is in bed with the city's largest newspaper, The Los Angeles Times.This was a fantastic movie.

Hauntingly beautiful.It takes place in 1928 in LA, and Eastwood definitely gave it that old classic film feel with its antique cars, trolley, amazing hats, and sad sad trumpet.Angelina is amazing.  It had to be the hats and those lips, and those eyes.  You really felt her pain as Christine Collins, a mother whose child goes missing.  The LAPD tell her they've found her child five months later, but its the wrong boy.They then try to convince Christine she's crazy because the boy says he's her son.  Despite dental records and the words of teachers also saying its not her boy, Christine is committed to a mental institution.  At the mercy of the police, this movie tears your heart apart slowly and like Christine herself, you'll cry for justice.""I want my son.  I want MY son back,"" she cries.It's hard to believe this really happened.  So, while watching it, don't forget that finger printing and DNA evidence weren't around back in the 20s.  I'd certainly hope something like this would never happen today, but there are indeed innocent people in prisons who are only victims of bad fate.Christine found herself at the mercy of a serial killer who may, or may not, have killed her son.  The killer sent a telegram to her two years after trial on the eve of his execution, but even then couldn't bring himself to actually admit to her face what he might have done.Christine watched him hang, but still didn't find solace until 5 years later when another missing child was found who had also been kidnapped by the killer.  Her son had helped the kid escape.  So, there was hope that maybe her boy escaped too.The real Christine died, still searching for her son but never finding him.  But just as she said in the film after hearing the kid's story about how her son helped him escape, ""His story gave me something I didn't have before.

This film follows the case of Christine Collins, who's son went missing in the 1920's and then what happened when the police force returned a boy five months later who they claim is her son but who in reality isn't. Christine then tries to fight the corrupt police department as they refuse to admit their mistake and even claim she is mentally ill to try to make her go away. This takes up the majority of the first half of the film and the second half deals with a whole other aspect of the story that I won't divulge here to prevent spoilers. Needless to say the second half is just as overwrought and emotional as the first half and by the end you will truly feel wrung out and affected. It was a revelation to see Jolie act so well and if you were a doubter of her abilities in the past then this film may show just what she is capable of. This is quite a bleak film but has very powerful performances and has all the more impact by the fact that it is based on true events. I have quickly become a fan of Eastwoods directing and if you have enjoyed other films of his in the past then I'd say it is a good bet you will enjoy this. He seems to know how to choose scripts with depth and gravitas and manages to portray that on film especially well. This may not be deemed positive or happy viewing, but a film doesn't always need to be to have an effect or impact and this film offers both of these in spades.

I don't remember why I was interested in seeing the film, a ghost story about a composer (George C. Scott) who moves into a haunted house after his wife and daughter die in a tragic accident, only to be haunted by a little boy, in a wheelchair, in the attic. But it freaked me out. I couldn't go near my closet for weeks. The fact that I still remember the film gives you evidence of how scared I was.You may be asking yourself ""What, beyond the title, is the connection to the new Clint Eastwood film ""Changeling""? I'll get to that. Bear with me.Eastwood is an accomplished director, a dependable actor and a pretty good musician. As he has aged, he has concentrated more time behind the camera, creating some great films for our enjoyment. He has even won Oscars for directing ""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"", both extremely powerful films. Now, he turns his attention to the film ""Changeling"" starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich and written by J. Michael Stracyncski.Christine Collins (Jolie) is a single mom living with her son, Michael, in a small house in South Pasadena. As a supervisor of an exchange for the phone company, she keeps busy, but is able to get home early enough to provide a loving home for her child. One evening, work calls, ruining their plans for a fun Saturday. She reluctantly leaves Walter, her son, home alone, promising to take him to the movies the next day. As it is 1928, and most of the neighbors leave their doors unlocked, she isn't too concerned. But when she returns, Walter is nowhere to be found. She frantically calls the police and they cut her off. She is instructed to call back when Michael has been missing for more than 24 hours. The next day, she is able to file a report. A few weeks later, she receives a call from Captain JJ Jones (Jeffrey Donovan, TV's ""Burn Notice"") and he takes her to the train station for the return of her son. With reporters in tow, Jones and his boss, Chief Davis (Colm Feore) are eager for a positive press opportunity; the LAPD has been under attack for some time. As soon as Christine sees the boy, she knows he isn't her son and tells Jones this. But he insists he is the right boy and pressures her to smile for the cameras. Christine takes the boy in, but continues to deny he is her son. As the police department trots one ridiculous theory after another by her, Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a powerful Presbyterian Minister with a radio show, intends to help Christine and help expose more corruption at the LAPD, something he has made his mission.John Malkovich is always at least interesting and in ""Changeling"" he is quite good. As the powerful preacher Reverend Briegleb, he recognizes an opportunity with Ms. Collins, preaching to his congregation about her plight, even though he has never met her and she isn't one of his parishioners. But in his eyes, anyone treated poorly by the LAPD is a parishioner and deserves his help and protection. When he learns of the new boy the LAPD is trying to push into her arms, and the actions they take to ensure she remain 'out of the press', he becomes more galvanized, more determined than ever to help the innocent, sweet young single mother.Malkovich could so easily portray this powerful figure as overtly power hungry, very sinister and as corrupt as the LAPD. But Malkovich paints the Presbyterian pastor's mission well, showing the zeal with which this man is determined to expose the corruption of the LAPD. There is a hint at the power this man has and seeks, but it only helps to flesh out the rest of the character. There is an underlying sense that the more helpful the person is to his mission, to his cause, the more powerfully he embraces them.I was also struck by how believable Anjelina Jolie is in this role. Early on, when she is at the police station, trying to convince Captain Jones she knows who her real son is, a man touches her on the shoulder, guiding her towards another room. In this moment, Collins is about as insignificant as she can be, and Jolie seems to shrink in on her self and become extremely vulnerable; her arms move in front of her chest and she looks down, unsure of where to go. This struck me as remarkable because Jolie's real life persona is that of a very strong woman. She has played ""Lara Croft"", she has been an UN Ambassador, she looks like she could kick Brad Pitt's butt. But in ""Changleing"", she portrays Collins' place in the world, in Los Angeles, circa 1928, very well, making the woman seem believable and insignificant, until pushed too far.As she realizes the LAPD will not be any help (they send a pediatrician to her house to convince her her son could have shrunk four inches and other physical changes are possible, much to her disbelief) she becomes more determined than ever to get her real son back and to make waves for the LAPD. But the LAPD has some tricks up their sleeves and they put Collins through the ringer. As Collins is subjected to all of this different abuse, she turns to the Reverend for help.The LAPD is run by Chief Davis (Colm Feore) and he is desperate for the department to get as much good publicity as possible. When Collins proves too persistent, he instructs Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan), the head of the department dealing with juvenile matters to make her go away. So Jones starts off by threatening Collins. When that doesn't work, he ratchets the persuasion up and makes Collins life hell.Donovan does a great job or portraying Jones swagger and arrogance. As a male, in the LAPD, he sees no wrong in coercing Ms. Collins into accepting a boy she knows is not her own. As Collins becomes more persistent, he feels the mounting pressure to make her disappear and goes to some pretty horrific and stupefying lengths to stop her.But the ""Changeling"" becomes too much of a procedural, robbing the story of some of its power. We spend a lot of time watching a suspicious character who may be responsible for the disappearance of Christine's son. He is an interesting character, and he becomes more interesting when he interacts with Christine, late in the film. But until that point, he seems like a distraction. We spend a lot of time watching police officers interrogate children who may be involved in the case. They tell stories that help to fill in blanks, but as they are telling stories, the narrative becomes compromised as we watch lengthy flashbacks. We spend a lot of time in court as two different cases are deliberated. We spend a lot of time away from Christine and the Reverend, a lot of time away from Captain Jones. A lot of time away from the three most interesting people in the film.The film is much better, much more powerful as we spend time with Christine, the Reverend and Captain Jones. These characters are each powerful and each unique and help to guide us through the story. When the focus shifts away from them, the film becomes more like ""Law and Order: Historical Crimes Unit"" showing us every detail of this exhaustive case. And many of these details don't add significantly to the overall story and the tapestry of these characters and their involvement in the crime.Eastwood seems determined to live up to the title card ""A True Story"" which appears at the beginning of the film. Most movies state, ""Based on a True Story"". Not Eastwood. If he says ""A True Story"", he is going to show us as much as possible relating to this terrible crime. And a lot of this shifts us away from Jolie and the emotion of her character's story.And the film is too long. As the film tries to tie up each individual string of the story, going so far as to introduce us to another couple that have lost a child and showing us the outcome of that story, it takes too long for us to feel any closure to Christine's story. If there can be any closure.Also, there seemed to be about sixteen too many shots of Jolie with a tear falling down her cheek, a tear addressed to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a tear determined to get the actress another Oscar.""Changeling"" is not one of Eastwood's best films. The story doesn't stay focused in the right place throughout. And because of this, it loses its power. When you look at Eastwood's work, there are many unforgettable, many powerful films that we will remember for years to come. I doubt ""Changeling"" will have the same longevity. If someone were to ask me about ""Changeling"" in say, a year, I would probably start telling them about a horror film I saw in 1980, a film that scared me, a film that had an effect on me, a film that I remember to this day.I don't think Clint Eastwood's ""Changeling"" will have the same fate.",4,"Eastwood's ""Changeling"" Becomes Too Procedural",1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,8724,"['1980',

1158988,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00188M5TM,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Clint Eastwood's thriller/drama ""Changeling"" is a tough film to sit through at times because of the subject matter it deals with (portrayed with aptly simple and understated touch, though). The extraordinary story of Christine Collins, which involves horrifying violence and injustice, is a bit long for some, but it remains compelling throughout without relying on sensationalism.One of the greatest assets of the film based on the true events is, not surprisingly, Angelina Jolie and her strong performance as Christine Collins, whose 9-year-old boy Walter disappeared in Los Angels, in 1928. Five months later police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) in charge of the case announces that the boy was found in DeKalb, Illinois. However, Christine Collins is shocked to know that the ""Walter"" who shows up before her is not her son although the police and ""Walter"" himself claim that he is. But what really happened to Walter Collins?Angelina Jolie ditches her Lara Croft image for a new role as a grief-stricken woman who continues to fight for what she loves. Michael Kelly is equally memorable as Detective Ybarra, who plays an important role in uncovering the horrible truths behind the missing case. But perhaps the real star is the city of Los Angles and Tom Stern's cinematography that vividly describes the world where Christine Collins and her son Walter lived.""Changeling is another impressive achievement from Clint Eastwood, a powerful character-driven drama, bolstered with gifted actors, beautifully-shot cinematography and sure-handed direction.",5,Another Great Work from Clint Eastwood,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,1564,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'thriller/drama', 'Changeling', 'tough', 'film', 'sit', 'times', 'subject', 'matter', 'portrayed', 'aptly', 'simple', 'understated', 'touch', 'though', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'horrifying', 'violence', 'injustice', 'bit', 'long', 'compelling', 'relying', 'sensationalism.One', 'greatest', 'assets', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'strong', 'performance', 'Christine', 'Collins', '9-year-old', 'boy', 'Walter', 'disappeared', 'Los', 'Angels', '1928', 'Five', 'months', 'later', 'police', 'Captain', 'J.J.', 'Jones', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'charge', 'case', 'boy', 'was', 'found', 'DeKalb', 'Illinois', 'However', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'shocked', 'know', 'Walter', 'who', 'up', 'not', 'son', 'police', 'Walter', 'claim', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Walter', 'Collins', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'image', 'new', 'role', 'grief-stricken', 'woman', 'who', 'fight', 'what', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'equally', 'memorable', 'Detective', 'Ybarra', 'who', 'important', 'role', 'uncovering', 'horrible', 'truths', 'missing', 'case', 'perhaps', 'real', 'star', 'city', 'Los', 'Angles', 'Tom', 'Stern', 'cinematography', 'vividly', 'world', 'where', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'son', 'Walter', 'lived', 'Changeling', 'impressive', 'achievement', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'powerful', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'bolstered', 'gifted', 'actors', 'beautifully-shot', 'cinematography', 'sure-handed', 'direction']",Changeling Theatrical Release
1158989,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00188M5TM,Turfseer,"[22, 32]","In the old days, Clint Eastwood was Dirty Harry, the vigilante maverick pitted against a world of bleeding heart liberals. Now times have changed and he's drifted more toward the left. In Million Dollar Baby, spokespersons for the Roman Catholic Church are the bad guys because they're against assisted suicide. In Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood attempts to soft pedal Japanese fanaticism by offering up the quid pro quo of a 'good' Japanese soldier to balance out a 'bad' one. And here in 'Changeling', it's the corrupt LAPD from the late 1920s which is the subject of another one of Eastwood's morality plays.In Eastwood's world view, it's simply a question of good vs. evil. That's why he's always drawn to melodrama which is the perfect type of drama for reminding us that he's always on the 'right' (and winning) side! Changeling's screenwriter, Michael Straczynski, researched this true crime story for a year and then changed the facts not only to improve the narrative but to also manipulate our emotions. Part of his quandary was that he needed to integrate two tangentially related aspects of the story, the kidnapping of the 10 year old boy, Walter Collins, and the mass murders of children on the Northcott Farm (Straczynski decided not to put the killer's mother into the script even though she actually confessed to the murder of the Collins boy and was sentenced to prison).Stracyznski is much more successful simply relating the details of the investigation into the child killings. Tension builds as one of the detectives uncovers the horror quite by chance after having to track down a juvenile runaway who needs to be deported to his native Canada. Before he's shipped back home, the juvenile reveals the sickening details of what happened and this in turn leads to a series of grim scenes including the digging up of evidence, the flight and apprehension of the accused in Vancouver, flashbacks of the actual crimes and the eventual trial and execution of the murderer.James Harner as Gordon Northcott, looks a lot like the actual killer (check the old photos!) and ably conveys his creepy manic and manipulative demeanor. When dealing with the historical facts of the crime itself, Eastwood is on solid ground. He falters however when he dwells too long on the sickening circumstances of the killer's execution. What exactly is the point in drawing out this scene? Again it's part and parcel of Eastwood's strategy to champion himself as the guardian of morality. The bad guys always must get their comeuppance whether it's pointing a gun at a miscreant and blurting out ""make my day"" or having a serial killer twist at the end of the hangman's rope a little longer than the viewer needs to see.Unfortunately Stracyznski appears to be at a complete loss as to what to do with the film's protagonist, Christine Collins. In real life, Collin's husband was locked up in San Quentin. Could it be that Collins wasn't the saint that Stracyznski makes her out to be? It certainly would have been more interesting to have Collins depicted as a complicated human being than the melodramatic victim depicted here. Collin's victimhood reaches its apotheosis when the police lock her up without a warrant at the Psychopathic Hospital. In a derivative scene right out of 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest', Collins is subjected to various degradations including a strip search, imprisonment on the mental ward, a coercive interview by the institution's vile psychiatrist and shock treatment given to a prostitute who comes to her aid (Stracyznski fails to do his research since shock treatment wasn't used in mental institutions until 1937!).Angelina Jolie is not an actor of great range to begin with but here she's saddled with a script that tells us virtually nothing about its main character. Jolie is good at histrionic expression but after awhile there are a few too many scenes where she pleads, ""I want my child back"". The film's ending loses dramatic tension since the protagonist becomes a passive participant. Collins not only sits through Northcottt's trial but she also is a spectator at the City inquiry into police misconduct in her case. In addition to Christine, the good Reverand Briegleb, played by John Malkovich, is another overly self-righteous character who remains underdeveloped (I also wondered if the police were so corrupt, why didn't they at least harass the Reverand at any point?) James Donovan's J.J. Jones was much more on the mark as Christine's tormentor (although the Irish accent probably would have been more applicable to New York than Los Angeles).Despite his liberal leanings these days, Clint Eastwood will never give up his original moniker as 'Dirty Harry'. He'll always be the man to protect us from the criminal element whether they be ordinary street thugs, corrupt police and government officials, serial killers or (as in his new film, Gran Torino) Asian street gangs!

I knew it would be heartbreaking and sad, but I hoped it would have at least some scrap of hope and resolution at the end.It didn't.This movie was nearly 3 hours long. 3 hours of watching Angelina Jolie cry, scream, sob, beg, and break down. Now I will say that her acting was incredible. I can only imagine the emotional fortitude she needed to play that role, to become the distraught, heartbroken mother over and over again, and to do it so perfectly. I also relished John Malkovich (does he EVER do a bad acting job?) and his fearless, heroic role. Yes, the acting from everyone is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from an Eastwood-directed movie. The sets are perfectly Great Depression-ish, with bland washed-out colors and lots of great historic costumes and locations.But the story. Good Lord. ""Depressing"" doesn't even describe it. As mother to a 12 year old boy myself, I can't even conceive of how I would function if he went missing. Watching Jolie cry and sob over and over... and over... that was hard enough on my maternal instincts. I kept waiting for some good thing, some positive slant, some bit of hope that her son would be found, that he'd be alive, SOMETHING.But no. It just dragged on. Jolie weeps. The cops are mean to her. She weeps some more. The cops are even meaner. She screams and weeps more. We learn about the murderer and his other victims. More crying. Court room scenes. Sober faces. Crying. The movie ends stating that Mrs. Collins never stopped searching for her son.THAT'S supposed to be an ending? We just watched this woman mourn and grieve for three hours while the LA police treat her like garbage. And THAT'S the ending? She doesn't find her son. She never even knows if he's alive (chances are, he wasn't, of course, since he never reappeared or contacted her again).If you're in a terribly good mood, and you just need something to bring you down and shame you for ever cracking a smile... watch this movie.

Well, apparently they did in Los Angeles back in 1928 and this fact is actually very disquieting. ""Changeling"" is a film based on the experiences of a woman named Christine Collins and on the murders of a small town outside L.A. called ""Wineville"". Co-produced by Clint Eastwood and written by one of my favorite writers, J. Michael Straczynski (Babylon 5, Midnight Nation, Thor), the film is a powerful piece of filmmaking. I've always had a fondness for Eastwood films and this film further cements the reasons why.Los Angeles, 1928. When single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) comes home from work, she finds that her son, Walter (Gatlin Griffith) has vanished without a trace. Five months later, the LAPD reunite mother and son; but the problem is, the boy is not her son. Her pleas are ignored by Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan, Burn Notice) and dismissed as a mother's unreasonable ravings. Driven by one woman's relentless quest for the truth, and aided by Rev. Briegleb (John Malcovich), the case exposes a world of corruption, captivates the public and changes Los Angeles forever.The questions you have to ask yourself when you see the first half of the film is why is this boy claiming to be Walter Collins? There is no doubt that Christine is of sound mind and no one would know her son better than a mother would. While the film's main premise is simple, it manages to stick to its high points and manages to grip the audience through emotion. This film would be more appreciated by mothers, as it does tackle one woman's stand against the injustice being done her. The screenplay also manages to pull a few surprises, as the subplot with another boy who is an illegal immigrant from Canada gives doses of dark, very disturbingly real undertones. The movie is divided into two parts in three acts, the experiences of Christine Collins and the investigations of the Wineville murders. (this small town had changed its name after this incident) The second half nicely blends in with the film's overall premise which is blackmail, corruption, and the abuse by authority figures.I've read somewhere that a melodrama is a film that revolves around its characters and I believe this strongly. ""Changeling"" is a melodrama, of this there is no doubt and much of the film's burden falls on Angelina Jolie. Jolie gives a very superb performance, she isn't loud or overly dramatic, she performs with such emotional finesse that when you look into her eyes, you can feel her pain. She rightfully deserved to be nominated for this film. John Malcovich exudes that familiar character and intensity--he seems obnoxious at times but his character overflows with righteousness. Malcovich was very strong and firm in his performance. Jeffrey Donovan plays the cop who is the root of Collins' troubles, Capt. Jones represents the arrogance and responsibilities of this corrupt police force. However, there is one conscientious cop in the persona of Detective Ybarra who is played by Michael Kelly. Despite his limited screen time, Kelly's character was in a good number of key moments in the film; for example, the interrogation scene between Kelly and amazingly good young actor Eddie Alderson is one of the film`s key dramatic moments. As soon as you think the film is done with its surprises, Jason Butler Harner threatened to steal the show as one of the most disquietingly creepy performances since Hannibal Lecter.Acting aside, which proved to be the film's greatest strength, the film's cinematography is also definitely noteworthy. One could easily ignore the scenery amid all the tearful moments and hysterics thrown into the screenplay, but the period costumes, set designs, and camerawork do deserve some credit. Eastwood keeps the camerawork tight and precise, but he manages to make use of the widescreen frame to fully utilize each scenario to convey the actual mood by using close ups, simple camera pans and perspective. Eastwood and Jolie work real well together, after all, Jolie is such a beauteous actress to shoot in close ups. Jolie looks great and she felt very comfortable with her role, unquestionably one of her best performances.The only fault that I could find in the film is that the courtroom and trial sequences felt a little rushed, that I thought that they could have been better, but I thought that maybe it was a way to maintain focus on Christine Collins and its tone. The emotional high points do reach an all time high in a number of key scenes, (especially the scenes in the final moments of the 2nd act) and the resolutions and expositions in the last act may also prove a little too overlong to some.Eastwood's films are never visually flashy, he keeps them straight-forward to emulate reality by avoiding elaborate camera trickery. In sticking to his old-school mechanics, Eastwood manages to  maintain the focus on his characters. Clint Eastwood is among my favorite directors and working with Straczynski, they have presented a gut-wrenching, gripping, experience that can be compared to ""L.A. Confidential"". Eastwood fulfills his promise as a filmmaker with grace and finesse; too bad he is still a little underappreciated. This should change.Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]Video/Audio: 2.40 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Beautiful transfer mastered in high definition. This is one of the few releases that haven't suffered from the marketing ploy to make dvd look bad to favor the Blu-ray push. Colors are accurate with strong black levels, clean and vibrant transfer and looks awesome when up-converted to 1080p. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track sounds clear and powerful enough for this type of film.Extras: Making of feature and a Profile on the lead actress/character.

Pama ""Yogesh""","[5, 13]","Does one really dare to cross all the admiration of this undoubtedly heavy-handed, very american product that is  certainly familiar with the somewaht base tastes of its audience and panders to it unashamedly?The actual story is indeed remarkable, but I was left to wonder how much of it was dramatised and not really factual.Either way, I must add my voice of disappointment, which is aimed particularly at those who remain bent upon deifying Eastwood somewhat unjustly, who, in my opinion, has not been in top form lately, despite the opinion of his friends and public and undeserved oscars.  Of course it may ultimately be a story worth filming, if only for us to be yet again astonished at what else the human psyche is capable of inflicting on those who least deserve it.  And naturally, such a bizarre formula will find it's audience, as schlock movies do as well.But, for me, there are just too many loose ends; improbable and melo-dramatic solutions to the story to deserve the accolades that are being showered upon it for some or other inexplicable reason.  The film lacks finesse and understanding and approaches its subject matter pandering to an unintelligent audience, which is hooked on matter that may be likened to fast food.  Of course there's nothing wrong with this if it happens to be your taste.  I simply object to it being advertised under false pretenses.I believe that a serious film maker ultimately has a duty to guide and uplift his audience and not to merely keep it hooked on trash.yogesh",2,Just another heavyhanded cowboy movie:  Fast food,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,1519,"['one', 'really', 'dare', 'cross', 'admiration', 'undoubtedly', 'heavy-handed', 'very', 'american', 'product', 'certainly', 'familiar', 'somewaht', 'base', 'tastes', 'audience', 'panders', 'unashamedly', 'actual', 'story', 'indeed', 'remarkable', 'was', 'left', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'dramatised', 'not', 'really', 'factual.Either', 'way', 'must', 'add', 'voice', 'disappointment', 'aimed', 'particularly', 'who', 'remain', 'bent', 'deifying', 'Eastwood', 'somewhat', 'unjustly', 'who', 'opinion', 'not', 'been', 'top', 'form', 'lately', 'opinion', 'friends', 'public', 'undeserved', 'oscars', 'course', 'may', 'ultimately', 'be', 'story', 'worth', 'filming', 'only', 'be', 'yet', 'again', 'astonished', 'what', 'else', 'human', 'psyche', 'capable', 'inflicting', 'who', 'least', 'deserve', 'naturally', 'bizarre', 'formula', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'schlock', 'movies', 'do', 'well.But', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'improbable', 'melo-dramatic', 'solutions', 'story', 'deserve', 'accolades', 'are', 'being', 'showered', 'other', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'film', 'finesse', 'understanding', 'subject', 'matter', 'pandering', 'unintelligent', 'audience', 'hooked', 'matter', 'may', 'be', 'likened', 'fast', 'food', 'course', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'be', 'taste', 'simply', 'object', 'being', 'advertised', 'false', 'pretenses.I', 'believe', 'serious', 'film', 'maker', 'ultimately', 'duty', 'guide', 'uplift', 'audience', 'not', 'merely', 'keep', 'hooked', 'trash.yogesh']",Changeling Theatrical Release
1159004,AP3B615GM191G,B00188M5TM,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[5, 5]","For the past 5-10 years, I have enjoyed watching the supreme acting talents of Clint Eastwood in films such as Bloodwork, Million Dollar Baby, and (most recently) Gran Torino.  This film, however, also cements Eastwood as not only a top actor, but also a spectacular director.The plot of the film centers on the story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), who after having her son Walter go missing for a few months is reunited...with the wrong boy.  However, in order to save themselves some bad publicity, the Los Angeles Police Department insists that the boy IS indeed her son and, once drawn into the lie, will do whatever it takes (including institutionalizing Collins) to make sure that the truth about her case is never known.  At the same time as Collins' story is playing out, the real abductor of her son, Gordon Northcott, is being investigated for the brutal murder of perhaps as many as 20 young boys, of which Walter may or may not be one of.Like most of Eastwood's more recent films, this movie resonates with the audience in multiple ways.  While watching, you will sympathize with Christine Collins over the screw-job she is getting from the LAPD, while also be horrified at the Northcott case not only because of what he did, but because he was allowed to keep doing so while the LAPD were trying to save face.  Of course, you never know how much ""creative license"" (think Denzel Washington's portrayal of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter as a complete innocent) a director takes within a film, but in this case I trust the judgment of Eastwood.  Plus, even if the LAPD were only half as bad as portrayed by Eastwood, they would still be responsible for the despicable acts brought down upon Christine Collins.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the film, though, is the performance by Angelina Jolie as Collins.  While better know for her blatantly sexual roles in such films as ""Tomb Raider"", ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", and ""Wanted"", Eastwood is able to do a complete makeover on Jolie, turning her into a character that we can all root for, and not just for her body.  I gained a lot of respect for Jolie's acting talents by watching this film.In a final touch, Eastwood also infuses his own simple brand of music into the film.  Whereas in ""Million Dollar Baby"" it was the simple plinking of piano keys, in ""Changeling"" it is the simplistic strumming of a guitar that provides what little dramatic backdrop is needed to the storytelling.  Eastwood knows that the story alone is compelling enough, so instead of opting for a dramatic score he just keeps it simple, which was the correct choice.Thus, I recommend this film to anyone who just wants to watch a really interesting, true dramatic story.  Though some of the subject matter may be a bit intense for the faint of heart, it needs to be that way in order to convey the horrific events surrounding the case of Christine Collins and her son Walter.  Like nearly every Clint Eastwood project, whether acting, directing, or producing, this one will have you thinking about its events long after viewing.",5,Cements Eastwood As Top Director,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,3068,"['past', '5-10', 'years', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'supreme', 'acting', 'talents', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'such', 'Bloodwork', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'most', 'recently', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'film', 'however', 'also', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'only', 'top', 'actor', 'also', 'spectacular', 'director.The', 'plot', 'film', 'centers', 'story', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'having', 'son', 'Walter', 'go', 'missing', 'few', 'months', 'reunited', 'wrong', 'boy', 'However', 'order', 'save', 'bad', 'publicity', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'Department', 'boy', 'IS', 'indeed', 'son', 'once', 'drawn', 'lie', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'including', 'institutionalizing', 'Collins', 'make', 'sure', 'truth', 'case', 'never', 'known', 'same', 'time', 'Collins', 'story', 'playing', 'out', 'real', 'abductor', 'son', 'Gordon', 'Northcott', 'being', 'investigated', 'brutal', 'murder', 'perhaps', 'as', 'many', '20', 'young', 'boys', 'Walter', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'Eastwood', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'movie', 'audience', 'multiple', 'ways', 'watching', 'will', 'sympathize', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'screw-job', 'getting', 'LAPD', 'also', 'be', 'horrified', 'Northcott', 'case', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'allowed', 'keep', 'doing', 'so', 'LAPD', 'were', 'trying', 'save', 'face', 'course', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'creative', 'license', 'think', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'portrayal', 'Rubin', 'Hurricane', 'Carter', 'complete', 'innocent', 'director', 'film', 'case', 'trust', 'judgment', 'Eastwood', 'even', 'LAPD', 'were', 'only', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'portrayed', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'responsible', 'despicable', 'acts', 'brought', 'down', 'upon', 'Christine', 'Collins.Perhaps', 'most', 'remarkable', 'aspect', 'film', 'performance', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Collins', 'better', 'know', 'blatantly', 'sexual', 'roles', 'such', 'films', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'Wanted', 'Eastwood', 'able', 'do', 'complete', 'makeover', 'Jolie', 'turning', 'character', 'can', 'root', 'not', 'just', 'body', 'gained', 'lot', 'respect', 'Jolie', 'acting', 'talents', 'watching', 'film.In', 'final', 'touch', 'Eastwood', 'also', 'own', 'simple', 'brand', 'music', 'film', 'Whereas', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'was', 'simple', 'plinking', 'piano', 'keys', 'Changeling', 'simplistic', 'strumming', 'guitar', 'what', 'little', 'dramatic', 'backdrop', 'needed', 'storytelling', 'Eastwood', 'story', 'alone', 'compelling', 'enough', 'instead', 'opting', 'dramatic', 'score', 'just', 'keeps', 'simple', 'was', 'correct', 'choice.Thus', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'watch', 'really', 'interesting', 'true', 'dramatic', 'story', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'intense', 'faint', 'heart', 'be', 'way', 'order', 'convey', 'horrific', 'events', 'surrounding', 'case', 'Christine', 'Collins', 'son', 'Walter', 'nearly', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'project', 'acting', 'directing', 'producing', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'events', 'long', 'viewing']",Changeling Theatrical Release
