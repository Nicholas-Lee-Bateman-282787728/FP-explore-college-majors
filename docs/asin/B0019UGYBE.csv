1164750,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B0019UGYBE,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","The premise is as silly as they come, but it's a wonderful movie anyway.  An aging millionaire (Gene Lockhart) captures and (partially) tames a feisty, scruffy orange tomcat he names ""Rhubarb"" (originally slang for a baseball-game fracas).  The millionaire dies and leaves his $30 million estate, including a Brooklyn baseball team, to the cat, and appoints his assistant (Ray Milland) the cat's guardian.  The baseball team initially resent Rhubarb but warm up to him and make him their mascot and good-luck charm; the team's playing improves so much they're in contention for the pennant.  Trouble intervenes in the form of the millionaire's selfish daughter, who tries to have Rhubarb declared invalid in court.  Did I mention that the team manager's daughter, played by Jan Sterling, is engaged to Ray Milland's character but deathly allergic to Rhubarb?  This is the kind of comedy they don't make anymore and probably couldn't if they tried: it has real heart, some wit, and lots of slapstick.  William Frawley (""Fred Mertz"" on I LOVE LUCY) plays the team manager.  Look quick for a very young Leonard Nimoy as one of the ballplayers; Sterling's then-husband, Paul Douglas, gets off an impromptu pun on the name of his best-known film at the movie's very end.  Good for all ages.  Currently there are no extras but the DVD is quite cheap.Comparison IMDb ratings (1951 films):ON THE RIVIERA  -  6.4RHUBARB  -  6.7ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD - 6.9",5,This Cat's Got Claws!  --,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,1446,"['premise', 'as', 'silly', 'come', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'anyway', 'aging', 'millionaire', 'Gene', 'Lockhart', 'captures', 'partially', 'feisty', 'scruffy', 'orange', 'tomcat', 'Rhubarb', 'originally', 'slang', 'baseball-game', 'fracas', 'millionaire', 'dies', '30', 'million', 'estate', 'including', 'Brooklyn', 'baseball', 'team', 'cat', 'assistant', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'cat', 'guardian', 'baseball', 'team', 'initially', 'resent', 'Rhubarb', 'warm', 'up', 'make', 'mascot', 'good-luck', 'charm', 'team', 'playing', 'so', 'much', ""'re"", 'contention', 'pennant', 'Trouble', 'intervenes', 'form', 'millionaire', 'selfish', 'daughter', 'who', 'have', 'Rhubarb', 'declared', 'invalid', 'court', 'Did', 'mention', 'team', 'manager', 'daughter', 'played', 'Jan', 'Sterling', 'engaged', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'character', 'deathly', 'allergic', 'Rhubarb', 'kind', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'tried', 'real', 'heart', 'wit', 'lots', 'slapstick', 'William', 'Frawley', 'Fred', 'Mertz', 'LOVE', 'LUCY', 'team', 'manager', 'Look', 'quick', 'very', 'young', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'one', 'ballplayers', 'Sterling', 'then-husband', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'off', 'impromptu', 'pun', 'name', 'best-known', 'film', 'movie', 'very', 'end', 'Good', 'ages', 'Currently', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'quite', 'cheap.Comparison', 'IMDb', 'ratings', '1951', 'films', 'THE', 'RIVIERA', '6.4RHUBARB', '6.7ANGELS', 'IN', 'THE', 'OUTFIELD', '6.9']",N/A
1164751,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0019UGYBE,Annie Van Auken,"[12, 12]","Fourteen felines were used to make the screwball comedy RHUBARB; the most famous of these was ""Orangey,"" who 10 years later was ""Cat"" in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Old Wrigley Field in Los Angeles appears here; sports fans may recall this park from the early '60s TV show, ""Home Run Derby.""""Rhubarb"" is the story of a feisty feral cat who steals the golfball of an eccentric millionaire ball team owner, along with the man's heart. He eventually captures the golf course dweller and names it ""Rhubarb"" (which in baseball lingo is a heated argument, usually between the umpire and a coach, manager or player). After they'd spent two contented years together, the man who is now dying leaves all his money and the sports team to Rhubarb.The players aren't too happy with being owned by a cat and they stage a mass walkout. Rhubarb's appointed caretaker, Eric Yeagar (Milland) uses some trickery to convince the superstitious team that their cat is in reality a lucky charm. Believing they can't lose makes the once faltering ""Brooklyns"" invincible; they win the pennant and are huge favorites to repeat in the World Series. Bookmakers overwhelmed with the number of ""sure bets"" decide to eliminate the source of Brooklyn's success-- Rhubarb.Among the movie's extensive number of uncredited actors are Strother Martin ('Shorty' McGirk) and Leonard Nimoy (young ballplayer). Watch in the final scene for a cameo by Paul Douglas (Jan Sterling's husband), who uses a play on words to plug his latest project, ""A Letter to Three Wives.""Bill Frawley also appeared in two other baseball movies (that starred William Bendix): THE BABE RUTH STORY (1948) andKILL THE UMPIRE(1950), which is presented here as a double feature along with SAFE AT HOME (1962) (includes cameos by the '62 Yankees).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(7.1) Rhubarb (1951) - Ray Milland/Jan Sterling/Gene Lockhart/William Frawley/Donald MacBride/Orangey (uncredited: Strother Martin/Leonard Nimoy/Tristram Coffin/Don Haggerty/Paul Douglas)",4,Big league cat,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,2069,"['Fourteen', 'felines', 'were', 'used', 'make', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'RHUBARB', 'most', 'famous', 'was', 'Orangey', 'who', '10', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'Cat', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'Old', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'here', 'sports', 'fans', 'may', 'recall', 'park', 'early', 'TV', 'show', 'Home', 'Run', 'Derby', 'Rhubarb', 'story', 'feisty', 'feral', 'cat', 'who', 'golfball', 'eccentric', 'millionaire', 'ball', 'team', 'owner', 'man', 'heart', 'eventually', 'golf', 'course', 'dweller', 'Rhubarb', 'baseball', 'lingo', 'heated', 'argument', 'usually', 'umpire', 'coach', 'manager', 'player', ""'d"", 'spent', 'two', 'contented', 'years', 'together', 'man', 'who', 'now', 'dying', 'money', 'sports', 'team', 'Rhubarb.The', 'players', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'being', 'owned', 'cat', 'stage', 'mass', 'walkout', 'Rhubarb', 'appointed', 'caretaker', 'Eric', 'Yeagar', 'Milland', 'trickery', 'convince', 'superstitious', 'team', 'cat', 'reality', 'lucky', 'charm', 'Believing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'once', 'faltering', 'Brooklyns', 'invincible', 'win', 'pennant', 'are', 'huge', 'favorites', 'repeat', 'World', 'Series', 'Bookmakers', 'overwhelmed', 'number', 'sure', 'bets', 'decide', 'eliminate', 'source', 'Brooklyn', 'success', 'movie', 'extensive', 'number', 'uncredited', 'actors', 'are', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'McGirk', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'young', 'ballplayer', 'Watch', 'final', 'scene', 'cameo', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'Jan', 'Sterling', 'husband', 'who', 'play', 'words', 'plug', 'latest', 'project', 'Letter', 'Three', 'Wives', 'Bill', 'Frawley', 'also', 'appeared', 'two', 'other', 'baseball', 'movies', 'starred', 'William', 'Bendix', 'BABE', 'RUTH', 'STORY', '1948', 'THE', 'UMPIRE', '1950', 'presented', 'here', 'double', 'feature', 'SAFE', 'AT', 'HOME', '1962', 'cameos', ""'62"", 'Yankees', '.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', 'found', 'film', 'resource', 'website', '7.1', 'Rhubarb', '1951', 'Ray', 'Milland/Jan', 'Sterling/Gene', 'Lockhart/William', 'Frawley/Donald', 'MacBride/Orangey', 'uncredited', 'Strother', 'Martin/Leonard', 'Nimoy/Tristram', 'Coffin/Don', 'Haggerty/Paul', 'Douglas']",N/A

A cat that can fight and beat dogs, an eccentric baseball team owner who dies and leaves the team to the cat (Rhubarb), the cat's guardian (Ray Milland) whose fiancee is allergic to cats, a group of gangsters who believe Rhubarb is hurting their earnings in the field of betting (the team begins to win after they believe Rhubarb is good luck), and the dead owner's relations who have been left penniless by Rhubarb usurping them in their inheritance all mix together to make great fun for cat lovers and baseball lovers alike. Nobody remembers this one very much because it is rarely televised and also because it was made by Paramount, a studio that tends to neglect its many classic films. In fact, the expression that the Joker utters in the 1989 Batman film : ""Never rub another man's Rhubarb"" refers to this film, although almost everyone assumed a more unsavory meaning for the expression. The baseball team in this film starts to turn their luck around when one batter pets (rubs) Rhubarb before a game. It really is a great family movie, but not many people at all have seen this one and thus few understand what the Joker was talking about.This film is finally coming to DVD July 1.

As soon as it arrived, I opened it up and popped it in the DVD player.We first meet Rhubarb as a rather nasty feral cat who hangs around at a golf course and steals golf balls.  Millionaire T.J. Banner takes a shine to the kitty, and adopts him.  The two become fast friends.  Banner owns a baseball team called the Brooklyn Loons.  When he passes away, he shocks everyone, including his cat-hating, money-hungry daughter, Myra, when the will is read, and Rhubarb inherits the bulk of his fortune, including the baseball team.  Myra doesn't even get to be the cat's guardian; that role goes to Eric Yeager, the team's publicist, who also must run the team.  At first, Eric doesn't want the role, but after a run-in with Myra, he changes his mind, and so the fun begins.The ballplayers are not thrilled at first to be working for a cat, but Rhubarb soon wins them over, and becomes a good luck charm for the team.  He becomes very popular with the fans, especially with a pretty lady cat.  But if life went smoothly after that, we would not have much of a movie.  Eric's fiancee, Polly, soon realizes she is allergic to Rhubarb.  There is also an attempted catnapping/murder, a court case, as well as a real catnapping later on in the story.This movie is funny and very well-acted, with a wonderful story with a happy ending.  It's the kind of movie that they don't make any more, but you wish they still did.  If you have kids, you don't have to be afraid to let them watch this.  It's a fun movie for everyone.There is another baseball movie starring Ray Milland, ""It Happens Every Spring"".
