We have spent hours of family time together as we watch these wonderful movies.  I would highly recommend to anyone who has either girls or boys.,5,simply enjoyable,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,273,"['daughter', 'loved', 'original', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Now', 'son', 'own', 'who', 'getting', 'dinosaurs', 'have', 'spent', 'hours', 'family', 'time', 'together', 'watch', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'girls', 'boys']",N/A

My preschooler especially enjoys #5: The Mysterious Island, and #8: The Big Freeze.  The only film I thought was particulary lame is #7:  Stone of Cold Fire.  That one has a particularly poor storyline, the music is a bit too melodramatic, and the supporting acting is just a bit too over the top in my opinion.  The other 3 films are pretty good and there are even some scenes that can still make me laugh after already seeing them probably 100 times at this point.  I don't think I've met a kid yet that wasn't entertained by the majority of the Land Before Time films.",4,Fun films for kids,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,621,"['pack', 'Land', 'Time', 'films', 's', '5-8', 'preschooler', 'especially', '5', 'Mysterious', 'Island', '8', 'Big', 'Freeze', 'only', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'particulary', 'lame', '7', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Fire', 'one', 'particularly', 'poor', 'storyline', 'music', 'bit', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'supporting', 'acting', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'top', 'opinion', 'other', '3', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'even', 'scenes', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'already', 'seeing', 'probably', '100', 'times', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'met', 'kid', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertained', 'majority', 'Land', 'Time', 'films']",N/A
