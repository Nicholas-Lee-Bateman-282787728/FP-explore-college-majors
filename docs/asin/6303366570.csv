The idea of course was to show him humorously failing at these events as he tries to impress the woman he loves.  In my opinion, he could have spent half the time on this portion of the movie and still gotten the point across...he was hopeless at sports.  It went from being funny to boring as time went on.BUT!The second part of the movie I thought was great.

370882,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6303366570,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","In COLLEGE (1927), Buster Keaton portrays an anti-athletics bookworm named Ronald who, for love's sake, adopts a totally different philosophy.At their high school graduation ceremony, Ronald alienates a girl he's sweet on by giving a speech that disparages sports. To try to win Mary's affections, Ronald enrolls in college, where he hopes to become an athlete. He fails miserably however-- an interesting premise, especially in Buster's case, for he was a naturally-gifted baseball player and acrobat capable of immense feats of strength.Defeated and depressed, Ronald's honors-level grades plummet, so the school's dean gets involved. He sympathetically puts Ronald on the rowing team as coxswain (the man who steers). Mary comes to appreciate all of the young man's efforts, but when Jeff, her jock boyfriend is expelled from school, he takes Mary hostage, hoping she'll get thrown out, too and they can be married. This brings Ronald running to the rescue.Also recommended: Buster'sSHERLOCK, JR.(1924) has some of the most astounding trick photography ever seen. It's the story of a movie projectionist with an overactive imagination.

370884,A14XW8BJGEBM91,6303366570,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[0, 0]","For those who are not familiar with the name Buster Keaton, it is sufficient to say that, along with Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd, he was one of cinema's early and most famous masters of comedy. Joseph Frank ""Buster"" Keaton (1895-1966) made his mark in silent movies, as an actor, director, writer and director, and was able to carry on successfully to the talkies. One is his best and most memorable - a classic -- film is, without a doubt, ""College,"" now available in the glorious Blu-ray format thanks to Kino.The story of ""College"" is quite simple and straight, yet humorous thanks to Keaton's physical comedy. He stars as ""a son,"" who just graduated with honors from high school. However, he is not admired by his classmates. That privilege, of course, belongs to ""a rival"" (Harold Goodwin), who is the athletic star. At the same time, Keaton is also attracted to ""the girl"" (Anne Cornwall); she likes him, but is kind of undecided. Soon after, all of them attend Clayton College, where Keaton decides to get into sports, so that he could win the girl's heart for good. Or, as he tells the school dean, ""I took up athletics because the girl I love thinks I am a weakling."" He tries everything - baseball, football, track and field... Because of this, his grades take a plunge, and the dean, who really likes him, tries to help him and find a solution.One of the things that I enjoy about watching Keaton's films, in addition to the humor, is the locations. Many of them are still around today, and one of the extras in the Blu-ray is, precisely, a visual essay of the film's locations by John Bengston. There are also audio commentaries by film historians, as well as ""The Scribe,"" a 30 min 1966 film believed to be Keaton's - ""Great Stone Face,"" as he was nicknamed --last filmed performance. Quite a Blu-ray, as you can see - one for collectors. ""College"" can also be obtained in Kinos's fantastic collection ""The Art of Buster Keaton,"" available both in DVD and Blu-ray.

370885,ACPLJ6XRXIZKD,6303366570,Cheated,"[3, 5]","The following review applies to the Kino VHS/DVD version that includes 3 Buster shorts as well as the main feature, &quot;College&quot;.COLLEGE (1927):  Bus stars as the valedictorian of his high school who goes to  college to exceed in athletics in order to impress the girl he's in love  with.  It's fun to watch him fail in all aspects of sports that the college  offers, but I think he went too far to make himself look ridiculous at  playing the game of baseball, which in reality he happened to be very  talented at.  What's more funny are the scenes of the jobs he gets while  working his way through college.  The interior of the soda  fountain/drugstore he works at would make a 21st century antique dealer  drool.  He also tries his hand working as a black waiter and intentionally  looks as bad in minstrel makeup as Al Jolson did.THE ELECTRIC HOUSE  (1922):  The Electric House involves his interest in gadgets.  Buster is  hired erroneously to electrify the house of a family who's away on  vacation.  Not wanting to refuse the job, he (incredibly!) finds out about  and installs electrical gadgets in the house from a learner's manual - all  this in the time span of an average vacation period (!).  The gadgets are  really clever though, including a moving stairway, which Buster actually  broke his leg on and caused him to stop shooting The Electric House until  the cast came off.  The filmed exteriors of the house were actually of  Buster's own home (it's neat-o!).HARD LUCK (1921):  This gag-infested  short stars Buster as a loser who repeatedly tries to commit suicide and  bungles each time. One gag shows him drink out of some guy's bottle marked  &quot;poison&quot;, dramatically fake a death act, then realize he drank  bootleg hootch, and goes back for more.  This was Buster's favorite short  because it included his favorite gag.  Unfortunately, we'll never see the  gag because the scene's been lost forever, despite gallant searches by film  historians worldwide to find it.  The scene is about Buster crashing  through the hole of a swimming pool and coming out of it years later with a  Chinese wife and kids.  Even without that scene, Hard Luck is pretty good.  This version had to be compiled from prints that were located from around  the world.  I could tell that at least one scene was found somewhere in the  United Kingdom because the word &quot;organization&quot; on a title card  was spelled &quot;organisation&quot;.THE BLACKSMITH (1922):  Bus and his  perennial heavy Joe Roberts work at a blacksmith shop. Joe plays his boss.  . .a meany boss.  Unlike the rest of us, I don't understand how Buster  could've related to the mean boss concept since, up until 1928 (at the age  of 32) when he got a &quot;factory&quot; job at MGM and started working  under the tyrant L.B. Mayer, Buster's real-life bosses (except for the  &quot;stripes&quot; that cluttered his World War 1 experience) were either  family or friends (I'm getting jealous) but he does pull it off.  The  Blacksmith is a fun short with lots of good gags. A scene where Bus  clumsily destroys a white Rolls Royce really makes you squirm and nervous.",5,Go Bus Go,957916800,"05 10, 2000",2000,3156,"['following', 'review', 'applies', 'Kino', 'VHS/DVD', 'version', '3', 'Buster', 'shorts', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'feature', 'quot', 'College', 'quot', '.COLLEGE', '1927', 'Bus', 'stars', 'valedictorian', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'college', 'exceed', 'athletics', 'order', 'impress', 'girl', 'love', 'fun', 'watch', 'fail', 'aspects', 'sports', 'college', 'offers', 'think', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'make', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'playing', 'game', 'baseball', 'reality', 'happened', 'be', 'very', 'talented', 'What', 'more', 'funny', 'are', 'scenes', 'jobs', 'working', 'way', 'college', 'interior', 'soda', 'fountain/drugstore', 'would', 'make', '21st', 'century', 'antique', 'dealer', 'drool', 'also', 'hand', 'working', 'black', 'waiter', 'intentionally', 'bad', 'minstrel', 'makeup', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'did.THE', 'ELECTRIC', 'HOUSE', '1922', 'Electric', 'House', 'interest', 'gadgets', 'Buster', 'hired', 'erroneously', 'electrify', 'house', 'family', 'who', 'away', 'vacation', 'Not', 'wanting', 'refuse', 'job', 'incredibly', 'out', 'about', 'installs', 'electrical', 'gadgets', 'house', 'learner', 'manual', 'time', 'span', 'average', 'vacation', 'period', 'gadgets', 'are', 'really', 'clever', 'including', 'moving', 'stairway', 'Buster', 'actually', 'broke', 'leg', 'caused', 'stop', 'shooting', 'Electric', 'House', 'cast', 'came', 'off', 'filmed', 'exteriors', 'house', 'were', 'actually', 'Buster', 'own', 'home', 'neat-o', '.HARD', 'LUCK', '1921', 'gag-infested', 'short', 'stars', 'Buster', 'loser', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'commit', 'suicide', 'bungles', 'time', 'One', 'gag', 'drink', 'guy', 'bottle', 'marked', 'quot', 'poison', 'quot', 'dramatically', 'fake', 'death', 'act', 'then', 'realize', 'drank', 'bootleg', 'hootch', 'back', 'more', 'was', 'Buster', 'favorite', 'short', 'included', 'favorite', 'gag', 'Unfortunately', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'gag', 'scene', 'been', 'lost', 'forever', 'gallant', 'searches', 'film', 'historians', 'worldwide', 'find', 'scene', 'Buster', 'crashing', 'hole', 'swimming', 'pool', 'coming', 'years', 'later', 'Chinese', 'wife', 'kids', 'Even', 'scene', 'Hard', 'Luck', 'pretty', 'good', 'version', 'had', 'be', 'compiled', 'prints', 'were', 'located', 'world', 'could', 'tell', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'found', 'somewhere', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'word', 'quot', 'organization', 'quot', 'title', 'card', 'was', 'spelled', 'quot', 'organisation', 'quot', 'BLACKSMITH', '1922', 'Bus', 'perennial', 'heavy', 'Joe', 'Roberts', 'work', 'blacksmith', 'shop', 'Joe', 'boss', '.a', 'meany', 'boss', 'rest', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'Buster', 'could', ""'ve"", 'related', 'mean', 'boss', 'concept', 'up', '1928', 'age', '32', 'when', 'got', 'quot', 'factory', 'quot', 'job', 'MGM', 'started', 'working', 'tyrant', 'L.B', 'Mayer', 'Buster', 'real-life', 'bosses', 'quot', 'quot', 'cluttered', 'World', 'War', '1', 'experience', 'were', 'family', 'friends', ""'m"", 'getting', 'jealous', 'pull', 'off', 'Blacksmith', 'fun', 'short', 'lots', 'good', 'gags', 'scene', 'where', 'Bus', 'clumsily', 'white', 'Rolls', 'Royce', 'really', 'squirm', 'nervous']","College with The Electric House, Hard Luck and The Blacksmith VHS"

The story is very simple and is clearly just there to hang gags on.  But what gags!  Many of them are sports gags (baseball, track and field, etc.) and Buster was clearly having a great time with them.  The Blu-ray looks very good and is noticeably better than the DVD though it's not as nice as The General or some other silents out there.  Given how old the film is, and the overall history of Hollywood and its film prints, it's understandable.  But College has never looked as good as this on home video, and I have it in every incarnation all the way back to a VHS bootleg in the late 80's.  I wish there was an alternate score with organ.

370891,A42GFMF12V7XR,6303366570,Paul J. Mular,"[9, 12]","Comparing this new Blu-ray release to the old Art Of Buster Keaton DVD shows much improvement.1) A significant amount of picture has been added to all sides! The old DVD was heavily cropped on all sides!  But this added picture comes with some downsides, there was a framing problem in the master film and at times there is a lighter grey-tone bar at the bottom of the picture. This was cropped off in the old DVD.2) The new High Definition transfer is sharper and does add details to the grass on the ground and the ivy on the buildings. Even the grainy replacement section at 24:51 looks way better here.3) The old DVD was a little too bright, some of the whites seemed to wash out.  This new transfer lowers the white levels to correct this. However it gives the film the look of being shot on a cloudy day. Some may like the brighter look of the old DVD, others will like this less washed-out presentation.  I prefer this version, but find the old DVD acceptable.4) Image stabilization has been used in this new transfer. The most noticeable improvement is in the opening titles, they are rock steady (but not a freeze frame).5) The original DVD had some of it's dialogue cards replaced with black background cards. Here in this new transfer, all dialogue cards have the same curtain background.  They look original, not recreations.The downside: Soms shots are still soft here and there as inferior prints had to be used where footage was missing fromt he original 35mm master.  But that is the nature of watching old films originally filmed on Nitrate film.This 1hour and 5 minute film has the same John Muri musical accompanyment as the old DVD, but it sounds crisper here.There is also an optional COMMENTARY TRACK by Slapsticon founder and film historian ROB FARR.BONUS MATERIAL:The old DVD included Buster's shorts that are now on the Buster Keaton Shorts Blu-ray, but no real bonuses.This Blu-ray has two bonus features:a) Silent Echos (9:55) a then & now look at the shooting locations of ""College"".b) The Scribe (29:25) a 1966 Construction Safety Associates of Onterio COLOR industrial film starring Buster.  This would be Buster's last appearance on film before he passed away.Buster is a new reporter who visits a construction site to report on construction accidents. However the biggest cause of accidents on this site is Buster himself.Buster doesn't speak in this sound film, he only points to a list of safety regulations and a narrator recites the regulation.  This pantomime separates him from reality and makes it easier to watch this now elderly man get bounced around.  This late example of Buster's work is a good indication on how the world sadly ignored this talented man since the 1940's.AS FOR THE FEATURE FILM, College has never been one of my favorites.  Buster is attending college (which was a new concept in Los Angeles in those days as their universities were just being built).  After giving a speech on how important studies are over athletics, Buster's girlfriend tells him he must re-think his ideas if she is going to stay with him.  So Buster enters that athletic world (in real life Buster is an athlete).  Buster's thrill of athletics is apparent here, but 15 minutes of him blundering around on the Track & Field Stadium doesn't make good cinema.  This happens right in the middle of the film, it feels like the pace grinds to a halt.  We smile at his blunders, but they are not genuinely funny.
