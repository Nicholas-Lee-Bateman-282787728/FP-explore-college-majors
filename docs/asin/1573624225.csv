It immediately struck me as a movie unlike any other, a movie that was dreamy yet down-to-earth, a movie that showed prejudice,  pain, adultery, and emotion- without blinking an eye. And recently, when I  found out that the girl who played 10-year old Devon (I apologize, I have  forgotten the actors name) also played the dead girl in &quot;The Sixth  Sense&quot;, I went and watched &quot;Lawn Dogs&quot; again on a whim.  Again, it mesmerized me. How well it all blended together, the little girl  with her wagon walking down hazy summer streets, the old trailer of the man  who everyone called &quot;white trash&quot;, the shady dealings of Devon's  upper-scale neighborhood, and the ignorance of the rich and prosperous. It  struck me how the upper-class citizens would sit around and snicker at the  lawn care &quot;white-trash&quot; while sipping brandy and cooking hot  dogs. Normally, I'd recommend this movie to everyone, but after the second  time, many parts struck me as shocking and very, very inappropriate. Of  course, I believe this is what holds so much in the movie, the fact that  the camera stands it's ground, unflinching to what is on screen.

Revolving around the Russian fairy tale of Baba Yaga (girl trapped by an evil witch who is rescued by her prince only to have to run away to escape Baba Yaga's wrath) much in the way &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; mirrored the story of the Pied Piper of Hamlin, the story follows these two friends/first loves?/confidantes (Mischa Barton and Sam Rockwell) as she follows her own and ignores the ignorance of her parents and he becomes more and more isolated from the town he lives in.Mischa Barton is wonderful as a girl who believes in magic and is able to weave a little of her own.  She is an &quot;old soul&quot; who knows better than to believe what everyone else thinks and knows to go her own way and make her own decisions.  In the end, when she takes matters into her own hands, she has achieved the wisdom and knowledge that most people dream of and never reach.  Sam Rockwell is also great as her companion who first doesn't know what to expect from this young girl who acts as though she should be his mother.  In fact, she is the only one who looks out for him, and as their relationship becomes more and more intimate though never obscene and always beautiful, the tragic occurs, and she must save him from the wrath of &quot;Baba Yaga.&quot;The ending is spectacular as Mischa's character displays all her magical talents.

190238,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,1573624225,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[50, 51]","This movie is an endearing tale of two square pegs in a round hole world. Devon, played by Mischa Barton, is a ten-year-old girl who has recently moved with her mother (Kathleen Quinlan) and father (Christopher McDonald) into an upscale, gated community with large houses and even larger lawns.  Devon isn't really interested in her peers, as ""they smell like TV and talk too fast"" so she tends to keep to herself, creating her own little worlds and stories, one, in particular that involves a witch named Baba Yaga and a young girl, presumably in reference to herself.  Trent (Sam Rockwell) is an early twenty something man who makes his living mowing lawns in the affluent community that Devon and her family reside.  Being that Trent is from 'the wrong side of the tracks', we get a sense that while it's acceptable for him to be in the enclosed community to do his work, once he's finished, he should collect his pay and be gone.  This is exemplified by the security officer (Bruce McGill) telling Trent that if he plans to be in the neighborhood past 5PM, he'd better clear it with him.  I think this also shows an underlying sense of paranoia within the exclusive community towards outsiders.The meeting of Devon and Trent occurs one day while Devon is attempting (hardly) to sell cookies for some sort of campfire girls' organization.  Seems she is doing it more to appease her upwardly mobile conscious father than anything else, and she decides to venture outside of the gated community to see what lies beyond the walls.  She comes across a ramshackle mobile home, finds no one home, and ventures inside. Just so happens this is where Trent lives, and he returns to find Devon inside his home.  He doesn't become angry, probably because he's got little or nothing worth stealing, but seems annoyed at this small intruder, as he tells her this is private property, and he ""ain't interested in buying no cookies"".  Devon leaves, but seems to have taken an interest in Trent.  She returns the next day, where she spies Trent and Pam (Angie Harmon) in a compromising position through a window of the trailer home.  Pam, a resident of the same community as Devon, appears to be just some rich girl getting her jollies with the local help, and this is confirmed later.  Trent, seeming to understand the extent of their relationship, makes some comments about wanting to meet her family, to which Pam says ""Yeah, right"".  Trent doesn't seem too put out by this, but then I probably wouldn't either as Angie Harmon is a fabulous babe.  What this does show, in my opinion, is yet another way the elitist class of the upscale community uses Trent for there own purposes, mowing lawns, sexual forays, or just a target for their deriding remarks.  After Pam leaves, Devon and Trent talk about various things, and find that they have something in common in that they have both had near death experiences.Trent, a little puzzled at why this girl has taken an interest in him, sees that she's harmless but understands that people would most likely misinterpret their relationship, and tells Devon that they can be friends, but it has to be secret. One day, while Trent is mowing a lawn across the street from Devon's house, Devon brings him some water, against her mother's wishes.  Trent gives Devon a turtle, which he rescued by not running over with his mower, or as Trent put it, ""turning into spaghetti"".  Devon's mother, not aware of their friendship, assumes the gift is an implication that Trent wants something from Devon, and his motives are of a sinister nature.  Eventually the innocent relationship between Devon and Trent is discovered, and immediately construed as being something that it's not.  I can't really blame them too much, as I would probably be a little suspicious of a twenty plus year old man and a 10-year-old girl spending a lot of time together.  Devon actually brings it to light, after an unfortunate incident with a dog. This leads to a violent confrontation outside Trent's home, and an unusual ending that was very unanticipated but ties in nicely with elements of the story. The ending countered very nicely the sense of pathos I developed as their friendship flourished, knowing that it would end badly.  There are many scenes I didn't go into, providing a richer depth of the main characters, fleshing them out quite nicely.One thing I found quite interesting was the way the community members were so quick to think the worst of Trent, and in the end, labeling him a monster, yet, we see that the true monster lies within themselves, in their infidelities, lies, contempt of those that are different, the sense of superiority that sometimes comes from wealth and power, and the perverse pleasure received by the subtle and not so subtle humiliation of those not in the same social class.  The wide screen presentation is very nice, along with the audio, and the special features include trailers and filmographies of the director and some of the stars.Ignore the cover art on the DVD case, as it alludes to some kind of sexual encounter between the characters shown, which never happens.  I'm assuming this was done in an effort to drawn people in, as sex sells, but, if that's your looking for, then you will probably be disappointed.  If your bag is an excellent little movie with interesting characters, good direction, a smidgen of humor, a dash of fantasy, and a rewarding ending, then look no further.",5,Innocence is a dangerous

Suffice it to say this is Mischa's best movie, and perhaps the best of any actors early performance. Unfortunately, her subsequent major roles are hit-and-miss - ""Skipped Parts"" being a hit, and ""Lost and Delirious"" is to be avoided at all costs.Sam Rockwell was also excellent as ""Trent"", the friend of Mischa's character (""Devon"").Elsewhere I read the one negative review of this movie by someone who seemed upset over nudity and child pornography. The fact that Mischa is topless for a few seconds (and shot from across the street, at night, and about 2 inches tall on my TV) does not quite fit the category of child pornography, I do not think, unless you are predisposed that way and really, really hard up.This is a story about a mis-matched friendship, and all the prejudices that attracts, plain and simple. Great dialog, too.Also, ignore the DVD cover - it has nothing to do with the movie. Why the mother takes up half the cover is a mystery - she is a minor character. The picture of the shirtless man is, I think, from the photo of his high-diving award, and the image of Devon and Trent on the truck actually takes place on a river bank, not on a lawn.

190243,A152C8GYY25HAH,1573624225,Matthew Horner,"[6, 6]","There seems to be no middle ground of opinion about Lawn Dogs. Critics, as well as the few people who saw it in theaters, either praised it or trashed it. It is an allegory told in a dark fairy tales style. It's story is many-layered, the director is uncompromising, and the audience is given no slack.Misha Barton plays Devon Stockard, a lonely ten-year old child, whose parents have recently moved into a gated community of pretentious, lifeless homes. She is recovering from open heart surgery, and this trauma has instilled in her a fascination with morbid topics.In this neighborhood, the lawns are relentlessly manicured, as if the residents were keeping all that is natural in comtrol. 21-year old Trent [Sam Rockwell] cuts the Stockard's grass, seemingly two or three times a week. Viewed by the residents as some sort of half-tamed beast, he is warned by a security guard never to stay past five in the afternoon without first ""checking"" with him.Devon and Trent form an unlikely friendship, one that most be kept secret from her parents and her neighbors. Trent is well aware of the hostile, paranoid attitudes of his clients. Here begins the sometimes funny, but often dark tale. The two are misfits in a society which itself is dangerous and suspect. We root for Devon and Trent to escape this world, and, in part, they do.There is a sexual tension between these characters, which will make some viewers uncomfortable, even though it is never acted upon. The film's merely hints at cross-generational attraction, but this alone removes it from the commercial mainstream.Lawn Dogs can be difficult to accept at times. It is thought provoking enough to give the average viewer a headache. Things happen to the main characters that we don't like. All of the supporting characters are so creepy we wish we'd never met them. Still, those who can tolerate all this will be rewarded by one of the most magical and lyrical endings ever filmed.Sam Rockwell gives an excellent performance in a truly difficult role. Misha Barton is extraordinary in one of the best acting jobs by a juvenile I have ever seen. Not since Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver have I watched a youngster master material which would be unfathomable to her contemporaries.

Her face is pliable and ultra expressive, and even though she's the strangest little 10 year old captured on film, her adult mannerisms and dialogue show us a little girl who has been treated like a China doll by her parents; she's had a rough life and heart problems, which she explains with a dippety dit, etc.  She wants to show that she is still a person and quite capable of doing the things her parents are trying to spare her from.

She is the daughter of one of the most well known couples (Christopher McDonald &amp; Kathleen Quinlan) in the neighborhood. The unlikely friendship becomes quite the upset once it's discovered. Everyone thinks that Sam Rockwell's character is trash. He lives in a rundown trailer down a gravel road thats near their upper class estates.

As Trent the &quot;white trash&quot; living in a trailer, he gives a knowing and intelligent performance as a man, who has  lived with this label his whole life. And the more we get to learn about  him, about his life during his school years, about his family and watch the  relationship he forges with 10 year old Devon, the more interesting and  sympathetic he becomes.There is no preciousness or cuteness to  Duigan's film, its magic lies in its understatment and its sharply drawn  characters. For once a 10 year old in a movie doesn't seem to be posing for  an ad, but gives a strong performance as a girl wise beyond her years. And  like in so many other films which unite outcasts, Devon and Trent become  close friends. This is not what the film is about though, the friendship  between them is only a hook to draw veiwers in, what this film is really  about is class devide, stereotyping of people and misleading  appearances.Christopher McDonald and Kathline Quinlan as Devon's  parents are a couple who seem to be raising their daughter out of a  parenting magazine. They are involved, worried and completely impersonal.  But there is a subtext to this, the father who hates looking at his  daughter's scar is a driven workaholic with all the right words but none of  the feeling. The mother doesn't have a job so she vents off in other  ways.As we watch these events develop to the powerful and poetic  conclusion of the film we are completely absorbed from start to finish.  What seperates this film from similar sounding dross like Digging To China  is its genuine heartfelt investment in its characters rather then cheap  heart tugging tactics. It is a  wonderful film.

That this is the intent of the film is made clear in the final seconds when the film's studied realism is completely abandoned to allow the hero to make good his escape with some rather unconvinving special effects.Well, it's a nice idea, but it's uneven and not fully worked out. There are some curious and underdeveloped side-strands: especially Devon's mother's sexual proclivities (except to the extent this identifies her with the witch) and some shallowly-buried insinutations of sexual tensions between Trent and local spoilt rich kid Sean, who were apparently once third-grade classmates.What rescues Lawn Dogs from incoherent oblivion is the compelling performance from the two leads, a great soundtrack and effectively marshalled dramatic tension: thematically we're in dangerous territory, with an adult-child/poor boy-rich girl relationship developing in the heart of a (somewhat caricatured) reactionary community, and director Duigan draws us into the inevitable unpleasant denouement skilfully.As the credits roll, it's a bit of a head scratcher, but it's done with enough style that it deserves the benefit of the doubt.Olly Buxton",3,Tense but somewhat incoherent,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,1698,"['Roger', 'Ebert', 'memorably', 'described', 'Lawn', 'Dogs', 'resembling', 'accident', 'symbol', 'factory', 'hard', 'disagree.It', 'interesting', 'fairy-tale', 'literally', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Devon', 'voice', 'intoning', 'story', 'Babi', 'Yaga', 'evil', 'child-stealing', 'witch', 'who', 'forbidden', 'forest', 'venturing', 'treeless', 'home', 'forbidden', 'wood', 'perhaps', 'symbolic', 'threshhold', 'adolescence', '.Except', 'clear', 'enchanted', 'wood-resident', 'lawnmower', 'man', 'Trent', ""n't"", 'Babi', 'Yaga', 'one', 'potential', 'victims', 'intent', 'film', 'made', 'clear', 'final', 'seconds', 'when', 'film', 'studied', 'realism', 'completely', 'abandoned', 'allow', 'hero', 'make', 'good', 'escape', 'rather', 'unconvinving', 'special', 'effects.Well', 'nice', 'idea', 'uneven', 'not', 'fully', 'worked', 'out', 'are', 'curious', 'underdeveloped', 'side-strands', 'especially', 'Devon', 'mother', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'extent', 'witch', 'shallowly-buried', 'insinutations', 'sexual', 'tensions', 'Trent', 'local', 'spoilt', 'rich', 'kid', 'Sean', 'who', 'were', 'apparently', 'once', 'third-grade', 'classmates.What', 'Lawn', 'Dogs', 'incoherent', 'oblivion', 'compelling', 'performance', 'two', 'leads', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'effectively', 'marshalled', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'thematically', ""'re"", 'dangerous', 'territory', 'adult-child/poor', 'boy-rich', 'girl', 'relationship', 'developing', 'heart', 'somewhat', 'caricatured', 'reactionary', 'community', 'director', 'Duigan', 'inevitable', 'unpleasant', 'denouement', 'skilfully.As', 'credits', 'roll', 'bit', 'head', 'scratcher', 'done', 'enough', 'style', 'benefit', 'doubt.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A
