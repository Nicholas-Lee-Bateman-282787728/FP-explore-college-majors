Watching it again on the home screen, I could appreciate its original story by David Dietz which is a thinking man's vampire story for those who enjoy good theatre as well as the story unfolds in a small bar primarily with memorable characters.  Dietz directed and stars as well with an incredibly well picked cast of unknowns including Dan I. Radakovich, Crystalann Jones and Megan Yost among others.  Every character is expertly portrayed by the actors making the script into a special event in its delivery of an unusual vampire story with brilliant touches of satiric comedy and well-paced suspense.  Kevin MacLeod did the original music which was especially interesting and appropriately sinister (with a selection of country and western rock music by Ruff Creek).  I have seen much talent in Pittsburgh, having lived there for 23 years and actively being a part of the film business there, but it is rare to see sure-fire talent as much as exhibited here by David Dietz.  It is all done well, right down set decoration, including a poster in the bar for the original Troma film, ""Mother's Day"" and a wanted poster for the actress who played the lead originally before being re-cast by Crystalann, of which some of her work is included in the extras with other deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage and trailer and slide gallery.  The special features on the disc by World-Wide Multi-Media include a short black-and-white film titled ""Shade's Last Run"" and also starring David Dietz with Jaime Slavinsky directed by Jason Bender also an unusual vampire tale.  One wishes there were more of both films.  Perhaps one day, we will see this film, ""Indemnity: Rage of a Jealous Vampire"" in a hallowed place in the vampire genre.  Keep it in mind.

I do not like cheesy vampire movies, and folks this is not one of them.
