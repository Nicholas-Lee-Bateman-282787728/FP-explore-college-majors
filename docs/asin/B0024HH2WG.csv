The storyline of a boy growing up and getting over his fear of the local bully seems almost too elaborate for this film.

While he at first goes to the cops and rats Mick out, he ends reversing course and the charges are dropped.Years later Mick and Charlie meet again when he unexpectedly shows up at Charlie's Ivy League college where Mick interjects himself into his life. Mick remains an unwanted presence taking the girl Charlie likes and sleeping with her repeatedly. Mick is just as brutally violent as before and it will ultimately have consequences as Charlie learns why Mick is there in the first place.This is not a family movie of any sorts and teaches us that you can be depraved and get away with it.

Underwhelming at times though and the music leaves something to be desired.Video - 3/4 - For DVD it is clean throughout with some noticeable grain.

E Jackson,"[2, 3]","Wow, talk about a VERY different spin on the typical school bully storyline.The Education of Charlie Banks is about a skinny and wimpy teenage college student who becomes friends with a guy who constantly beats people up.  Throughout the film, the college student is terrified that he'll end up being the bullies next victim, but the bully actually wants to be friends with the guy instead.One night the bully takes his anger issues a little too far and completely lays out a couple guys in a parking lot who were starting trouble.Well it turns out that the person who told the cops about the bully being responsible for the fighting incident is... the skinny, wimpy kid!  Yes that's right- the bullies own friend ratted him out.The storyline begins here- will the bully ever find out who ratted him out?  If he does, what will the bully do about it?  You'll have to watch the movie to find out.I swear, the guy who plays the bully looks identical to WWE wrestler John Morrison, haha.  Just a coincidence (unless Morrison is keeping a huge secret about a movie role... doubtful).What makes the Education of Charlie Banks such a good film is, of course, the bully himself.  The way he just completely flips out and snaps on people is incredible.  Talk about SERIOUS anger issues.I found myself thoroughly enjoying this movie from beginning to end.

1250077,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0024HH2WG,Brian E. Erland,"[2, 4]","Initially the only thing that drew me to 'The Education of Charlie Banks' was the presence of Jesse Eisenberg in the title role. I like to think of him as a next generation John Cusack, a nice looking but rather nerdish, awkward male who habitually over analyses and over talks every situation. Especially when there's a girl involved. After viewing the film I'm pleased to say that there's more here than just the usual strong, enjoyable Mr. Eisenberg.'The Education of Charlie Banks' is an entertaining, thoughtful and surprisingly intelligent journey into the minds, hearts and longtime strained relationship between two very different young men, Charlie and hardcore bully Mick (Jason Ritter). Mick has both frightened and fascinated Charlie since early childhood when Charlie witnessed a brutal beating handed out by the bully to another neighborhood boy. Unfortunately for Charlie his best friend and college room mate was also a friend of Mick's. When Mick shows up in their dorm room out of the blue all of Charlie's fears and anxieties from the past return, embodied in their surprise guest.Can people change for the better or is Mick still the angry, brutal, dangerous person he's always been. More importantly, will Charlie be able to face his fears and prepare himself for whatever lays ahead?This ""coming of age"" film will definitely surprise its viewers. The story line takes some nice twists and turns, the performances are impressive and Jason Ritter delivers a performance his Father would have been proud of. The chemistry between Eisenberg and Ritter worked beautifully.My rating: - 3 1/2 Star -.",3,"""No Wonder He Jumped"" ~ College Life, Deconstructionism And The Banality Of Evil",1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,1615,"['Initially', 'only', 'thing', 'drew', ""'The"", 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'was', 'presence', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'title', 'role', 'like', 'think', 'next', 'generation', 'John', 'Cusack', 'nice', 'looking', 'rather', 'nerdish', 'awkward', 'male', 'who', 'habitually', 'analyses', 'talks', 'situation', 'Especially', 'when', 'girl', 'involved', 'viewing', 'film', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'more', 'here', 'just', 'usual', 'strong', 'enjoyable', 'Mr', 'Eisenberg', ""'The"", 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'surprisingly', 'intelligent', 'journey', 'minds', 'hearts', 'longtime', 'strained', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'young', 'men', 'Charlie', 'hardcore', 'bully', 'Mick', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'Mick', 'frightened', 'fascinated', 'Charlie', 'early', 'childhood', 'when', 'Charlie', 'witnessed', 'brutal', 'beating', 'handed', 'out', 'bully', 'neighborhood', 'boy', 'Unfortunately', 'Charlie', 'best', 'friend', 'college', 'room', 'mate', 'was', 'also', 'friend', 'Mick', 'When', 'Mick', 'up', 'dorm', 'room', 'blue', 'Charlie', 'fears', 'anxieties', 'past', 'return', 'embodied', 'surprise', 'guest.Can', 'people', 'change', 'better', 'Mick', 'still', 'angry', 'brutal', 'dangerous', 'person', 'always', 'been', 'More', 'importantly', 'will', 'Charlie', 'be', 'able', 'face', 'fears', 'prepare', 'lays', 'ahead', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'story', 'line', 'nice', 'twists', 'turns', 'performances', 'are', 'impressive', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'performance', 'Father', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'chemistry', 'Eisenberg', 'Ritter', 'worked', 'beautifully.My', 'rating', '3', '1/2', 'Star']",Education Of Charlie Banks

He definitely has ambition and you can tell he put a lot of work into this. The acting is pretty good. I was happy to see John Ritter's son turning in good work.

The lighthearted side attempts to tell the story of a boy named Charlie and his college experience, the growth of a boy to a man.  With this growth comes all of the pains and suffering of experience.  And sure, some people like that real to life uneasiness that comes from awkward situations, but others do not.  If are one of the ""Nots"" - then this is not going to be your cup of tea... almost guaranteed.Charlie Banks (Jesse Eisenberg) is a likable character but the cast of associates he hangs around with ultimately causes him the situational problems that occur in this movie.  One of the standout performances of this movie is the one given by Jason Ritter.  I had seen him in Joan of Arcadia and thought he was very good actor and very reminiscent of his late father John Ritter.  But, in this movie Jason Ritter is playing outside of his typical casting and he is amazing.If I was to get into the philosophy of the college experience or life through chance, then you might understand the plot of this movie.  But, the plot is almost secondary to what is really just a simple story done well.  Though there are characters that tie Charlie to the character of Mick (Ritter) including a well acted love interest (Eva Amurri) and a great part played by Chris Marquette as the best friend.  Those characters only serve to keep the Ritter performance close by.  Ritter's character is almost just a catalyst for the Eisenberg character and vice versa.  Banks as the defensive but goodhearted non-socialite and Ritter as the blue-collared yet likable rough-edged outsider, these are the two sides of the spectrum that play well off of each other - and ultimately make this movie worth watching.You will never be able to guess how their opposite charged personalities will react from one encounter to the next.  To me, this is the reason to watch this movie... the unsteady tension of these moments.  But in the end, it is like watching a train while standing on the tracks.  Not exactly like watching a train wreck, but you get allure.  You can see it coming from a mile away and you don't want to be standing on the tracks when it arrives.",4,Like Watching a Train Wreck...

1250084,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0024HH2WG,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Directorial debut by Limp Bizkit, Fred Durst, is just so bad. Fred would have never thought to play some incredibly complex guitar shredding piece on his first gig in public. Instead, he chose to take on The Great Gatsby a very difficult film / story in capable hands, and fails miserably as a director. This might sound a bit extreme, but sadly Fred should just keep playing the guitar, he overtells his story, over makes his points, and just flat out doesn't understand film language.The first clue this film would be a problem - opening black screen, white statement *New York City*. Then cut to a city scene. Then black screen with white type *Late nineteen seventies.* Then we go on to see a bus ride and the first voice over dialog is about how this is Greenwich Village. We then see somebody dressed in bell bottom jeans, hear 1970's music. This is called beating your audience over the head with a sledge hammer. Either a director is skillful at setting the scene and time period through visuals and dialog; or he has no skill at it and resorts to subtitles warning the audience. Now the worst part of all this, there was no reason why this had to be set in Greenwich Village or New York City; or the late or early 1970's. None of it mattered.There was a glaring nasty mistake in the era language. Mick is said to *tag* a wall, and that he beat up somebody that put a *tag* over his. In that era, the word tag was never used to talk about grafitti. It was called grafitti then. Tags happened in the 90's and 2000's, not the 70's.So Durst has no ability to set the stage for the film, create an era, give a feeling of the period and make that important (he resorts to titles to do that work). He then goes on with sledge hammer after sledge hammer of redundancies. You would think that somebody this talented at music would know how to use music to enhance the film. Instead he bludgeons the viewer to death with impending doom music after the viewer has seen that something wrong is going to happen. The music music, not the sounds trying to telegraph emotions, was excellent. This would be a good soundtrack to purchase.Jesse Eisenberg - he's so geeky, he moves as badly as Jeff Goldblum (that means he has no idea how to move on camera), is he Michael Cera, is he Patrick Fudgit? No he's none of them, but he's all of them blended together. He sort of blends into the background. Jason Ritter, yes the performance is good. But he looks like Matt LeBlanc's younger brother, and seems to be Joey Tribiani, only mean. It's just so hard not to think of him that way. Eva Amuri as the hottsie totsie Mary, did get the early 80's look solid. She was well cast and delivered a decent performance. Chris Marquette as Danny, Charlie's best friend, was decent. Sebastian Stan, did a decent job as Leo, the rich kid everyone loves to hate. But his pontificating was just awful most of the time.If you know the Great Gatsby story, you have the plot line of this film. There's some roles jumbled around, but in general, it's the whole Great Gatsby thing. F. Scott Fitzgerald would be upset about this adaptation.Film wise, there's a lot wrong here. The film is easily 20 minutes too long (run time of 1 hour 40 minutes). Durst has no idea when to make his point and move on. He lingers too long on almost every plot point. Surround sound was good. Sadly the music was much louder than the dialog. I had to run the movie with subtitles enabled so as not to blow out the neighbors during the musical portions of the movie. This is just plain sad mix. Fortunately, almost all shots are in focus. Cameras are steady, they did not resort to very much hand held random movements.A solid indicator for me that a film is too long, the 2X fast forward button gets hit. This is just fast enough to get out of most dragging scenes, and the subtitles remain, so the plot can still be followed. I am pretty sure after the first 1/2 hour, this movie got about 15 or 20 moments of 2X fast forwarding (a very high bad number).The DVD includes a 23 minute yammering conversations behind the making of THe Education of Charlie Banks. It's the classic same old actor talking about their character, banal description of what you've already seen on screen. The only tidbit, apparently the story is based on something that happened to the screenwritter. Aside from that, if you watch the movie, you've seen everything they tell you about in this 23 minutes. Well skippable.The movie is rated R for strong language. There's a pretty nasty fight scene early on. The sound effects are brutally realistic. Normal Hollywood would have a huge bottle crash and breakage when a person gets hit in the head by a beer bottle. The real sound is probably more like what was in this film, a very loud sharp thud with no breakage. It was gut wrenching to say the least. There is no nudity, well except a scene from the rear where Jason Ritter strips down and jumps in the hot tub (NYPD blue showed more on television). There are a couple of senuous scenes, but it's all pretty chaste.I really did not care for this movie. It's not the topic, it's not that I don't understand what was trying to be told; I just appreciate well made film. This one is a very poorly made film by somebody that should stick with his music career. Fred Durst understands the language of music, he does not understand film language.",1,The Great Gatsby Poorly Done,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,5370,"['Directorial', 'debut', 'Limp', 'Bizkit',

1250085,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B0024HH2WG,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[2, 9]","""Most kids grow up with a boogeyman under their beds-- mine terrorized Grenwich Village,"" Charlie Banks (Jesse Eisenberg) says of Mick Lerry (Jason Ritter). This drama, written by Peter Elkoff, aims to be a collegiate variation of ""The Great Gatsby""  (characters make two major references to ""Gatsby"") with a dash of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" thrown in.With the exception of  charismatic, sexy Ritter/Mick, the rich college characters are neither good nor bad. They are merely boring. Eisenberg as Charlie is worse than boring. Both actor and character grow incessently annoying as the movie goes on. Charlie/Eisenberg is a nerdy, bookish, sulkish, surly,  wimp/bore.Charlie and others witness Mick commit a shockingly violent act at a party. Charlie is the only one who goes to the police but, under pressure and lacking a moral backbone of his own, he later recants  his testimony and the case against Mick is dropped. The incident leaves Charlie with a minor psychological bruise and he soon settles into a comfortable Ivy League existence. Three years later, Mick appears out of the blue in Charlie's dorm room. Even Mick's sudden reappearance doesn't disrupt Charlie's life much. Mick doesn't disrupt; he just ""hangs out."" He easily assimilates into campus life. He ""audits"" classes, but is not a student. Both Charlie and Mick fall in love with Mary (Eva Amurri), but only Mick gets her in bed. These rich kids do what they normally do: party, drink, have sex,  etc. and not much else.Inspiration frequently fails first time director Fred Durst. A major dramatic revelation is handeled in a lazily casual, offhanded manner. When Mick's violent nature rises to the surface again, Charlie reacts by having a major hissy-fit. When Charlie finally does ""man up"", it is much too little and much too late. Mick never comes across as a frightening bully. He's a sexy, charismatic guy with ""anger management issues"" who is pratically begging for  redemption and forgiveness.  Durst's directorial inexperience shows in the way he stages (and nearly ruins)  the dramatic climax. Mick calls Charlie ""a cold bitch"", and he's correct. I just wanted to slap Charlie/Eisenberg senseless.There are fine supporting performances by Christopher Marquette as Danny and Sebastian Stan as Leo. But it is Jason Ritter's performance that totally saves the movie. Ritter radiates real star charisma, and a ""STAR"" is exactly what he deserves to, and should,  be.

I found this movie to be terribly uneven and uneventful. What you would expect is a darkly tinged coming of age tale, what you receive is a director trying too hard to make this into a classic, which it just could not be. The film is overly long and perhaps if more time was spent in the editing room it may run a bit smoother and not lag in so many places. It's not particularly well acted, the script is linear and flat, and the direction is mediocre at best.

1250088,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B0024HH2WG,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[3, 7]","The Education of Charlie Banks is a highly intelligent drama that examines poignant issues surfaced by the struggle between the haves and have not and how important is to be part of a family, interacting with others and socializing to develop the right set of life skills.The main characters are played by: Jesse Eisenberg, Jason Ritter, Eva Amurri, Christopher Marquette, Sebastian Stan, and Gloria Votsis. For the most part, we were not familiar with the actors but they render magnificent performances.Jason Ritter's performance is superb and we felt as though we knew him, so we looked him up and were delighted to realize that he is the son of one of our favorite actors, the late John Ritter who used to play the role of Jack Tripper in ABC's show: Three's Company. So... we were looking at the father... through the son!This movie is about an introverted child who as he grows, learns to walk through the door of his fears, all in his desire to do the right thing.Charley and his best friend Danny witness a near murder of some students during a brawl at a party and Charlie goes to the police to tell them what happens, but his friend tells him that to ""rat"" on others is unacceptable behavior, that the person who contacted the police will soon be identified and that he would never rat on him... no matter what.So, Charlie goes back to the police and withdraws his testimony against Mick, the only thing the police had to get him convicted of nearly killing the two students. Charlie's father owns a book store and tells Charlie that he is sorry to see him choose to let the guilty person go without punishment, that ""Charlie has great ideals, but if he lets wrong go unpunished, then all is useless"" because no one should be able to get away with such violence.As the years go by, we now see Charlie, brilliantly performed by Eisenberg and Danny, performed by Christopher Marquette, matriculated in an Ivy League college, where super rich students attend classes and are able to afford fancy cars, acquire boats and live life with great ease.Leo, played by Sebastian Stan, is the epitome of a spoiled young man, who gives away his possessions as if giving out candy and yet is unable to sympathize with the struggle of a young woman who would lose her job if he would not return a key he takes to enter a party through the back door to not have to pay the $20 entrance fee.Nia, is a Greek heiress played by Gloria Votsis, and Mary, played by Amurri, is a beautiful young woman that Charlie falls in love with.Charlie is horrified when Mick appears at their college dorm asking to stay for a while. Mick tells Danny he is visiting for just a few days but Charlie suspects that he is there hiding from another episode of violent behavior. One night, while walking back to their room, his fears are aroused as he sees Mick hiding away from a police patrolling car that passes them on the street.Charlie's love for Mary continues to grow, but as soon as she meets Mick, she gets attracted to his dominant male charisma and soon, these two are involved in a torrid affair.At some point, while photographing Charlie, Mary confesses to him that her aristocratic senator father always tells her that he does not approve of the men she chooses to date,As time goes by, Charlie comes to realize that his father was right and that his choice has brought dire consequences to those in his closest circle of friendship.The dialogue is intense, intelligent, and the characters are developed with a sense of slow precision that keeps us riveted on the performers.We came to love Charlie, to despise and yet want to protect Mick, to feel contempt for Leo and yet wish we had his fortune.

As things stand, however, the combination of a dull, predictable plot and substandard acting make Charlie Banks a big ol' waste of time.The plot, such as it is, centers around Charlie Banks, played by Jesse Elsenberg who here plays the only kind of role that he ever plays, a nervous, nerdy nice kid perpetually afraid of getting swatted down like an insect. Charlie is enjoying the college life, having philosophical discussions with his friends while drinking beers, chasing women (unsuccessfully), when he and his roommate receive a visit from Mick (Jason Ritter), a charming sociopath that they know from earlier in the film.The meat of the film is supposed to revolve around Charlie's quasi-friendship with Mick, who is equal parts bully, mentor, and friend to Charlie. I won't ruin the ending but I will tell you that nothing happens that you don't expect. The writer attempts to prepare the audience for this lack of surprise by having the characters discuss The Great Gatsby and how, even the first time you read it, you already know how it's going to end, but that doesn't make it any less brilliant. In fact, they tell us, it makes it even better. It makes the ending seem all the more tragic because it's so inevitable.Well, Charlie Banks isn't The Great Gatsby and the formulaic ending (Charlie faces his fears, etc.) nicely caps off a film that is rich with stereotypes and cliches.The biggest problem with Charlie Banks, however, is the performance of Jason Ritter as the bully-friend-mentor, Mick. We are told repeatedly throughout the movie how charismatic Mick is, even though (or, perhaps, precisely because) he's such a violent guy. Jason Ritter doesn't come across as either dangerous or charismatic. Most of the time, he just looks goofy. He does hit people a few times, it's true, but that action does not spring naturally from his character; he simply does it because it's written in the script.The other lame performance in this movie is the love interest, Eva Amurri. Both Charlie and Mick are completely in love with this woman; I have no idea why. She's not particularly beautiful, she certainly never says or does anything even remotely interesting, and by the end of the film we still have no idea who she is or why she made the choices that she did.""The Education of Charlie Banks"" is a movie that will pound you over the head with its foreshadowing, symbolism, and attempts at ""deepness"" but ultimately it's just a big ol' bore.",2,"a mediocre movie, poorly acted",1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,2584,"['acting', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'movie', 'Not', 'great', 'decent', 'things', 'stand', 'however', 'combination', 'dull', 'predictable', 'plot', 'substandard', 'acting', 'make', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'big', 'ol', 'waste', 'time.The', 'plot', 'such', 'centers', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Elsenberg', 'who', 'here', 'only', 'kind', 'role', 'ever', 'nervous', 'nerdy', 'nice', 'kid', 'perpetually', 'afraid', 'getting', 'swatted', 'down', 'insect', 'Charlie', 'enjoying', 'college', 'life', 'having', 'philosophical', 'discussions', 'friends', 'drinking', 'beers', 'chasing', 'women', 'unsuccessfully', 'when', 'roommate', 'receive', 'visit', 'Mick', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'charming', 'sociopath', 'know', 'earlier', 'film.The', 'meat', 'film', 'supposed', 'revolve', 'around', 'Charlie', 'quasi-friendship', 'Mick', 'who', 'equal', 'parts', 'bully', 'mentor', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'ending', 'will', 'tell', 'nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'writer', 'attempts', 'prepare', 'audience', 'lack', 'surprise', 'having', 'characters', 'discuss', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'how', 'even', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'end', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'brilliant', 'fact', 'tell', 'even', 'better', 'ending', 'seem', 'more', 'tragic', 'so', 'inevitable.Well', 'Charlie', 'Banks', ""n't"", 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'formulaic', 'ending', 'Charlie', 'fears', 'etc', 'nicely', 'off', 'film', 'rich', 'stereotypes', 'cliches.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'however', 'performance', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'bully-friend-mentor', 'Mick', 'are', 'told', 'repeatedly', 'movie', 'how', 'charismatic', 'Mick', 'even', 'perhaps', 'precisely', 'such', 'violent', 'guy', 'Jason', 'Ritter', ""n't"", 'come', 'dangerous', 'charismatic', 'Most', 'time', 'just', 'goofy', 'hit', 'people', 'few', 'times', 'true', 'action', 'not', 'spring', 'naturally', 'character', 'simply', 'written', 'script.The', 'other', 'lame', 'performance', 'movie', 'love', 'interest', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'Charlie', 'Mick', 'are', 'completely', 'love', 'woman', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'not', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'certainly', 'never', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'end', 'film', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'why', 'made', 'choices', 'did', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'movie', 'will', 'pound', 'head', 'foreshadowing', 'symbolism', 'attempts', 'deepness', 'ultimately', 'just', 'big', 'ol', 'bore']",Education Of Charlie Banks

The rest of the cast are complete unknowns (to me anyway), but they all play their parts perfectly...  OK, except for the one rich guy who was constantly drunk.  He was definitely over-the-top.

Story revolves around Charlie, an intelligent, sensitive teenager (Jeffery Eisenberg of ""The Squid & The Whale"" and ""Adventureland"" fame) who has eagerly left behind his awkward days growing up as a middle-class child in NYC in order to attend an ivy-league school. One day, Charlie receives an unwelcome surprise visit from Mick (Jason Ritter of television's ""Joan of Arcadia""), a fearsome, none-too-smart, streetwise neighborhood bully from Charlie's old NYC days. Mick requests to bunk with Charlie at his dorm for a few days (for reasons known only to Mick), but soon a two-day visit becomes an indefinite residency, as Mick takes a liking to his new environment... and Charlie.This leisurely paced low-budget indie undeniably relies a little too often on tired coming-of-age cliches, with a script that often feels half-baked, including some weakly-sketched characters. Nevertheless, there are some fine performances to be found within this film, and the acting ensemble works well together (including an enjoyable turn from Ritter as the dangerously unpredictable, yet strangely likable bully).The script also touches upon truthful observations about social stratums within American society, how they are reinforced and maintained; yes, it's ""Fitzgerald-light"", but nevertheless, when the film tackles these themes of social class (and leaves behind the coming-of-age cliches), ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" becomes refreshingly ambitious,  and therefore intriguing.Regarding the technical aspects of the DVD, the widescreen anamorphic transfer is competent, but rather dull and soft, befitting its ultra-low-budget origins. The transfer works just fine for the film, but it's hardly home theater system demo material; ditto, the 5.1 audio.The extras include a rather flat audio commentary track from first-time film director (and ex-""Limp Bizkit"" frontman) Fred Durst and actor Jason Ritter, as well as a (slightly) more interesting 23 minute making-of doc.In all, ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" stands as a promising, if imperfect, film debut from director Fred Durst, and is worth a viewing for those so inclined.",3,"Coming-of-age indie drama is imperfect, but thoughtful and worth a look",1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,2225,"['Thoughtful', 'imperfect', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'set', 'NYC', 'late', ""1970's-early"", '1980', 'Story', 'revolves', 'Charlie', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'teenager', 'Jeffery', 'Eisenberg', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'Adventureland', 'fame', 'who', 'eagerly', 'left', 'behind', 'awkward', 'days', 'growing', 'up', 'middle-class', 'child', 'NYC', 'order', 'attend', 'ivy-league', 'school', 'One', 'day', 'Charlie', 'unwelcome', 'surprise', 'visit', 'Mick', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'television', 'Joan', 'Arcadia', 'fearsome', 'none-too-smart', 'streetwise', 'neighborhood', 'bully', 'Charlie', 'old', 'NYC', 'days', 'Mick', 'requests', 'bunk', 'Charlie', 'dorm', 'few', 'days', 'reasons', 'known', 'only', 'Mick', 'soon', 'two-day', 'visit', 'indefinite', 'residency', 'Mick', 'liking', 'new', 'environment', 'Charlie.This', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'undeniably', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'tired', 'coming-of-age', 'cliches', 'script', 'often', 'half-baked', 'including', 'weakly-sketched', 'characters', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'fine', 'performances', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'works', 'well', 'together', 'including', 'enjoyable', 'turn', 'Ritter', 'dangerously', 'unpredictable', 'yet', 'strangely', 'likable', 'bully', '.The', 'script', 'also', 'truthful', 'observations', 'social', 'stratums', 'American', 'society', 'how', 'are', 'reinforced', 'maintained', 'yes', 'Fitzgerald-light', 'nevertheless', 'when', 'film', 'themes', 'social', 'class', 'coming-of-age', 'cliches', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'refreshingly', 'ambitious', 'therefore', 'intriguing.Regarding', 'technical', 'aspects', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'competent', 'rather', 'dull', 'soft', 'befitting', 'ultra-low-budget', 'origins', 'transfer', 'just', 'fine', 'film', 'hardly', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'demo', 'material', 'ditto', '5.1', 'audio.The', 'extras', 'include', 'rather', 'flat', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'first-time', 'film', 'director', 'ex-', 'Limp', 'Bizkit', 'frontman', 'Fred', 'Durst', 'actor', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'as', 'well', 'slightly', 'more', 'interesting', '23', 'minute', 'making-of', 'doc.In', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'promising', 'imperfect', 'film', 'debut', 'director', 'Fred', 'Durst', 'viewing', 'so', 'inclined']",Education Of Charlie Banks

Mick has a following of friends who think he's real cool.  As a child, he mercilessly beat up the other boys on the playground.  Eventually he grows up to assault football jocks at preppy high school parties.An adorable nerd, Charlie Banks (Jesse Eisenberg of Wes Craven`s ""Cursed"") is from a caring middle class family; he witnesses Mick nearly kill the two jocks.  Charlie is willing to testify against him in court; however, he learns that his wealthy friend Danny idolizes Mick and he recounts his testimony.  Years later, Danny and Charlie are rooming at an Ivy League university and Mick appears, needing a place to stay.  He tries to assimilate with Danny's wealthy friends, managing to impress them and steal Charlie`s girlfriend Mary during the process.""The Education of Charlie Banks"" is a complex, psychological drama that unnerved me.  Even when Mick and his newfound friends are having fun and enjoying life, I felt tense and nervous.  I kept waiting for Mick to explode, revealing his true inner self.  Eventually, his anger is unleashed and all of Danny's friends become targets of Mick's uncontrollable violence.  The film abruptly turns from ""coming of age"" drama to psychological thriller that borders on horror.  The ending is rather shocking when dark secrets are finally revealed.The acting from all the leads is wonderful, the photography is beautiful, and Fred Durst's directorial debut is an excellent one.  The viewer can't help but feel an emotional attachment to the various characters which Durst brings vividly to life in this unique film.  Not only does Charlie receive an education, but the viewer will also - an education in honesty, forgiveness and acceptance.  Most of all, the viewer will learn that one must control his/her anger if one is to keep their friends.Once again, Anchor Bay Entertainment has released an exceptional DVD package.

1250097,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B0024HH2WG,J. Michael Click,"[3, 5]","Fred Durst's directorial debut is a tremendous disappointment, a film with a fatal - but deliberate - flaw that destroys its overall effect.  And that's sad because there are many fine things about ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" to admire ... including an outstanding performance by Jesse Eisenberg in the title role; solid supporting work by cast members Jason Ritter and Eva Amurri; fluid cinematography by Alex Nepomniaschy; and distinguished art direction, set decorations, and costumes that create a captivating sense of time and place (an Ivy League college in the mid-1970's).Unfortunately, all these considerable plusses are compromised by a morally ambiguous script by Peter Elkoff.  Elkoff introduces us to a bully named Mick (Ritter) whose violent and uncontrollable temper leads him to beat two of Charlie's high school classmates nearly to death.  Charlie, an eyewitness to the assault, at first agrees to help the police, and then backs down.  A couple of years pass and Mick shows up at Charlie's college and insinuates himself into Charlie's crowd of friends, seducing the young woman with whom Charlie is smitten (Amurri).  The stage is now set for a suspenseful clash between Charlie and Mick - and a crisis between Charlie and his own conscience - but instead, Elkoff reveals that Mick has finally gone too far and murdered someone; he then tries to build up audience sympathy for Mick!  At that point, the whole story collapses because Elkoff has already made Mick too much a villain, and he never gives the audience a reason to suddenly embrace this disturbed and unredeemed killer.Puzzled by this change of tone and theme, I sought answers in one of the DVD's extra features, ""Conversations Behind `The Education of Charlie Banks'"".  That's where I learned, through interviews, that screenwriter Elkoff and director Durst had deliberately diffused the natural arc of the story by shifting the emphasis off of Charlie and on to Mick.  Their intent was to be clever, and to give the audience something unexpected.  They succeeded - but not, unfortunately, in a believable way.  Thus, this offbeat film may be worth a rental, but is not recommended for purchase.",3,A Deliberately Sabotaged Disappointment,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,2183,"['Fred', 'Durst', 'directorial', 'debut', 'tremendous', 'disappointment', 'film', 'fatal', 'deliberate', 'flaw', 'overall', 'effect', 'sad', 'are', 'many', 'fine', 'things', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'admire', 'including', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'title', 'role', 'solid', 'supporting', 'work', 'cast', 'members', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'fluid', 'cinematography', 'Alex', 'Nepomniaschy', 'distinguished', 'art', 'direction', 'set', 'decorations', 'costumes', 'create', 'captivating', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'Ivy', 'League', 'college', 'mid-1970', '.Unfortunately', 'considerable', 'plusses', 'are', 'compromised', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'script', 'Peter', 'Elkoff', 'Elkoff', 'bully', 'named', 'Mick', 'Ritter', 'violent', 'uncontrollable', 'temper', 'beat', 'two', 'Charlie', 'high', 'school', 'classmates', 'nearly', 'death', 'Charlie', 'eyewitness', 'assault', 'first', 'agrees', 'help', 'police', 'then', 'down', 'couple', 'years', 'pass', 'Mick', 'up', 'Charlie', 'college', 'Charlie', 'crowd', 'friends', 'seducing', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'Charlie', 'smitten', 'Amurri', 'stage', 'now', 'set', 'suspenseful', 'clash', 'Charlie', 'Mick', 'crisis', 'Charlie', 'own', 'conscience', 'instead', 'Elkoff', 'Mick', 'finally', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'murdered', 'someone', 'then', 'build', 'up', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'Mick', 'point', 'whole', 'story', 'collapses', 'Elkoff', 'already', 'made', 'Mick', 'too', 'much', 'villain', 'never', 'audience', 'reason', 'suddenly', 'embrace', 'disturbed', 'unredeemed', 'killer.Puzzled', 'change', 'tone', 'theme', 'sought', 'answers', 'one', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'Conversations', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'where', 'learned', 'interviews', 'screenwriter', 'Elkoff', 'director', 'Durst', 'had', 'deliberately', 'diffused', 'natural', 'arc', 'story', 'shifting', 'emphasis', 'Charlie', 'Mick', 'intent', 'was', 'be', 'clever', 'give', 'audience', 'something', 'unexpected', 'succeeded', 'not', 'unfortunately', 'believable', 'way', 'Thus', 'offbeat', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'rental', 'not', 'recommended', 'purchase']",Education Of Charlie Banks
1250098,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0024HH2WG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 4]","When I first heard ""directed by Fred Durst"" in reference to this film, the slightest positive expectation I had for the movie went way down. I'm not a fan of Durst's music nor his celebrity persona, so I didn't have any sort of high expectations at all. I can't say I'd describe the film, now that I've seen it, as a ""tense and compelling drama"" but I'm still surprised by what I just saw.The movie begins in New York City in the early `70s where two young boys stand in awe of another young boy, who's the toughest kid in town. The first two boys are Charlie Banks and Danny; the tough kid is Mick Leary.Now, a few years later, Charlie (Jessie Eisenberg) and Danny (Christopher Marquette) run into Mick (Jason Ritter) at a party. Soon, Mick brutally assaults a couple of partygoers and Charlie reports it to the police.Now, Charlie and Danny are in college living the highlife, when Mick suddenly arrives.Charlie and Mick are very different characters. Charlie is timid and insecure, while Mick is suave and aggressive. Watching the two characters interact is interesting on it's own terms, but the performances are what really bring them to life.Ritter (the son of the late John Ritter) completely embodies Mick. He perfectly captures the charismatic, tough-guy element in his performance. I've seen Ritter in a few other independent films and this is a very different character than I've seen him play before, but he nails it. I think there is definitely movie-star potential in Ritter.Eisenberg is also very good as Charlie. Physically, he fits the role pretty well already. He looks like a shy, timid young man. The difference between Ritter and Eisenberg is that I can't see the latter playing characters very different from this one in future roles.The script (by Peter Elkoff) is well written. Good characterization, simple and subtle dialogue, etc. His use of voice-over narration by Charlie is scattered, as if he didn't know how to fill the scene with anything else, but other than that...He's written something unique.The Education of Charlie Banks is not a great film, but it doesn't over-stay it's welcome. It has great characters and a likeable cast and is surprisingly well-made too. Durst seems to be a natural behind the camera and, with that, this is a pretty impressive directorial debut. Anyone who's not a fan of Durst will certainly be surprised by this film, whether they like the film or not.

1250099,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0024HH2WG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","While some may be skeptical of Fred Durst's directorial debut, he shows some promise. Competent, yet distant, most of my reservations about recommending ""Charlie Banks"" have to do with the film's plotting and characterizations. The primary story revolves around two roommates at an Ivy League college and what happens when an old ""friend"" with a checkered and violent past shows up for an indefinite stay. A good set-up that lacks a bit of pay-off.A well made film, ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" is a movie I wanted to admire. However, something kept me at arm's length--I never really connected emotionally in a way that would have made my viewing experience more compelling. I think, perhaps, I never fully embraced Charlie Banks (Jesse Eisenberg) as the narrator or centerpiece of the film. His ""education"" or development just wasn't that intriguing and my lack of concern for him created somewhat of a void in the center of the film. Eisenberg was terrific in ""The Squid and the Whale"" and ""Roger Dodger,"" (this was before his Social Network acolades) his character just seems a little undercooked here.Ironically, the strangest bit of casting was the most effective. Jason Ritter, as bad boy Mick, seems a little soft and gentle to be the reprobate he is supposed to be in this film. But Ritter commands the screen. The story really works better as ""The Education of Mick."" As Mick infiltrates the university and strives to fit in, the story is on solid ground. I was fascinated by this aspect and think Ritter brilliantly brought balance to Mick's conflicted emotions about this alien world he doesn't belong to. With a different focus--I think this might have made an extraordinary film! But, as is, most of the film left me ambivalent. Easy enough to watch, but not much to remember. About 3 1/2 stars from me--mostly for Ritter.

I found it pointless, slow and a bit unfocused.This is a ""coming of age"" movie that focuses on the relationship between Charlie Banks, a nerdy and sensitive kid, and Mick, a bully and friends with Danny, Charlie's roommate and childhood friend. Mick shows up one day at the university  Charlie and Danny attend ad stays for about a month. Charlie and Mick's relationship is shown to evolve to a sort of friendship albeit always strained.The story is told from Charlie's point of view, and I could have cared less. I would have preferred Mick's point of view, it would have been more interesting.This movie is a social study, a character story and a setting study. Mick, a self-proclaimed blue collar character, experiences the differences in social status. The setting is just as much part of the story as the rest of the characters, as it is instrumental in bringing about changes to Mick showing him the possibilities of what could be.The cinematography was superb but the direction was all over the place. The acting sometimes fell flat, especially for Eva Amurri. Frankly, I was more interested in Gloria Votsis' character (Nia) and would have preferred if she were more central to the story.Although this is an interesting story with a lot of potential, it could have been better with a little more editing. The featurette is the only extra worth talking about as it explains the basis behind the movie and the motivations of the characters. The rest of the extras are the audio commentary and trailers.

This isn't fair because Durst has matured a lot since his days of jumping up and down screaming about nookie with Limp Bizkit. In fact he actually does a really nice job with this film.The movie is centered around the relationship between Charlie and Mick. Charlie is a socially awkward kid who witnesses Mick excessively beat up two punks. Charlie calls the police but later refuses to testify against Mick, setting him free. Mick disappears for a few years and Charlie goes to college. Charlie's roommate also knew Mick and one day Mick shows up in Charlie's dorm. Mick then befriends Charlie again and joins his circle of friends and becomes romantically involved with Charlie's love interest. Whether or not Mick knows about what Charlie had done to him years before is left up in the air.Mick is shown to be a pretty decent guy as he pals around with Charlie's group and he seems to be turning his life around. That is, until the past starts to catch up with him. I'll stop here because this is when the plot starts to get really good.This movie is an indie and it doesn't really have a big budget.

KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[3, 5]","Watching this film about childhood friends reminded me of my own youth and how sometimes we don't always get to pick who are friends are. 'The Education of Charlie Banks is a story that rings true to life.....or at least life as I know it!I grew up not so much being a ""tough guy"", but certainly a guy most people didn't want to pick a fight with! I tell you this because even though I was a strong willed person, I have had to deal with people like ""Mick"" on and off for the past 40 years. I didn't see myself so much as one of these characters, but these were people I knew growing up.This film deals with some very truthful relationships between real friends and people we are forced to associate with. The performances are really solid especially Jason Ritter who gives a scary performance without being scary. I have known people like this and I found his performance to be really dead on.Watching Ritter you can't help but see his late father John and for some reason in this tough guy performance I saw some Matt Dillon too!

1250104,A250AXLRBVYKB4,B0024HH2WG,"Nathan Beauchamp ""ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...","[3, 5]","THE EDUCATION OF CHARLIE BANKS is a mistitled film considering the protagonist Charlie learns next to nothing in the film's entire 100 minute run time. He starts out a kid who is dominated by fascination and fear of the antagonist, and ends up an older kid dominated by fear and fascination of the antagonist. The plot is stale, lifeless, and doesn't carry the story forward with any momentum at all.Charlie is a kid from Greenwich Village who grew up equally curious and afraid of bully Mic (who starts beating people senseless at the age of 8 and never looks back). His life is forever changed when he witnesses Mic commit a violent crime and then backs out of testifying against him (out of fear of reprisal), and who later heads off to an elite university, no-one the wiser that it was he who 'ratted' out Mic to the police. The second act begins with Charlie at school with a bunch of rich kids (Charlie himself is not rich).Charlie's inability to make decisions, act on his own behalf, or contend for the woman he's fallen in love with even as she is stolen away, make him a fairly irritating protagonist that it is very hard to like. His spinelessness is nearly constant throughout the film, and even at the very end when he is forced to act, he does so without any real emotion or energy. This movie watches like a boring version of FIGHT CLUB set at an upscale east coast university where the 'idle rich' do pretty much nothing except drink and get down like a rabbit colony (although that's kept mostly off camera). Charlie is such a painfully awkward biped (think Napoleon Dynamite's brother Kip with a bit of a hunch-back) that watching him shuffle around (much less play basketball!) is brutal. I'm not sure if actor Jesse Eisenberg walks like this in real life or if it was part of the character; regardless it's yet another reason he is very hard to root for.One of the worst things about the movie is how overblown the props are. Director Durst seems hell-bent on making sure you really, really KNOW that it is the 70s, and then later the 80s. RAGING BULL posters, Atari game systems, bell bottoms, and even the music are layered on with an intensity that treats the viewer like they've got a sub 80 IQ and need a movie strewn with visual ques to realize when the movie is set. What makes this infuriating is that the setting has NOTHING to do with the story; it could have been set in 1940 or 2009 and would not have changed a thing.There are a few bright spots, including a nice performance by Jason Ritter as Mic. He's got energy and charisma, and given a better character, directing, and dialogue, could potentially become an A-list talent. He's a bit of a one trick pony in the film, but he does that trick quite well. However, his character isn't given enough edge to really be scary, he's more of a charming bad-boy with a serious anger control problem--he says too much, and is treated too sympathetically by the director.The writing is occasionally interesting and highbrow, including references to Hegel, Deconstructionist Theory, and 'the banality of evil.' There are some subtexts that are not really explored, and might have made the movie that much better if they had been given some space. The implications of the discussion of deconstructionism is that the films serves that role in its exploration of the Mic character. Sadly, there is no real examination, only a facade that reveals nothing complex or rewarding.An example of this lack of depth & follow through is in the film's 'Checkov' problem. Anton Chekhov is widely recognized as the originator of the paradigm that you can't introduce a conspicuous person, object, or other plot element into a story and then never deliver a follow through (his example was a gun above the mantle piece that is described or shown, but then never fired--Alfred Hitchcock explored this concept ad nauseam inThe Trouble with Harry). There is a pretty good indication given in the film that Mic might be gay (he is shown surreptitiously smelling a piece of Danny's clothing (Charlie's room-mate and longtime friend of Mic) early in the film. Charlie sees him doing this, and makes a noise to alert Mic of his presence, and Mic turns away and pretends to be doing something else. Couple this with the fact that Mic came to stay at the college in the first place, as well as a conversation between Danny and Mic (both drunk after a school dance) in which Danny offers to dance with Mic, who looks a little too interested, and I'd say this is a major undeveloped plot line that should have been explored. It would certainly have added much more intrigue and depth to the storyline.An average film at best, THE EDUCATION OF CHARLIE BANKS never really drives any point home. Charlie doesn't seem to learn much of anything. The things he has learned don't count for much, and the viewer is left to puzzle over what the movie wanted to say. Apparently, not a whole lot.2/5 Stars.",2,"Flat, predictible, with a few solid performances",1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,4942,"['EDUCATION', 'OF', 'CHARLIE', 'BANKS', 'mistitled', 'film',

But I guess I had some learning to do myself, because this movie was just that.A realistic, character driven tale, ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" takes a completely unconventional and completely real approach to the relationship between a bully and a geek, though even applying those terms does the film a disservice.  Completely avoiding the cartoonish approach of bully comedies likeDrillbit Taylor, this film explores the volatile nature of the ""bully"" character (Mick, played exceptionally well by Jason Ritter), but what it really delves into deepest is the admiration and strange sort of friendship that develops between him and our protagonist Charlie Banks (played byAdventureland's Jesse Eisenberg).  It's a beautiful, tragic, and completely compelling story that explores themes of friendship, social issues, and redemption, but above all it's a character piece that takes apart the lives of a group of people and examines the various strings and connections that make them fully rounded, three dimensional people.The music used in the film is also really interesting.  Like the movie, the songs are beautiful, strange, and pensive.  I wondered if, at times, the music was overpowering, and I think there might have been one instance where that might have been the case, but in most situations it played into each scene, becoming part of the tapestry.  On the topic of audio, there was one problem when the music at the dance makes the voice-over almost inaudible, but it only lasted for a few seconds.  None of these minor quibbles took away from the overall experience of the film.  I know I'll be watching this movie over and over, because it is definitely one of those movies that you can fall in love with the first time, but begin to appreciate it more with every subsequent watch.10/10 Classic.",5,A Surprisingly Excellent Film,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,1989,"['someone', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'Fred', 'Durst', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'tense', 'challenging', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'might', 'have', 'laughed', 'guess', 'had', 'learning', 'do', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'that.A', 'realistic', 'character', 'driven', 'tale', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'completely', 'unconventional', 'completely', 'real', 'approach', 'relationship', 'bully', 'geek', 'though', 'even', 'applying', 'terms', 'film', 'disservice', 'Completely', 'avoiding', 'cartoonish', 'approach', 'bully', 'comedies', 'likeDrillbit', 'Taylor', 'film', 'volatile', 'nature', 'bully', 'character', 'Mick', 'played', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'what', 'really', 'deepest', 'admiration', 'strange', 'sort', 'friendship', 'protagonist', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'played', 'byAdventureland', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'completely', 'compelling', 'story', 'themes', 'friendship', 'social', 'issues', 'redemption', 'character', 'piece', 'apart', 'lives', 'group', 'people', 'various', 'strings', 'connections', 'make', 'fully', 'rounded', 'three', 'dimensional', 'people.The', 'music', 'used', 'film', 'also', 'really', 'interesting', 'movie', 'songs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'strange', 'pensive', 'wondered', 'times', 'music', 'was', 'overpowering', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'most', 'situations', 'played', 'scene', 'becoming', 'part', 'tapestry', 'topic', 'audio', 'was', 'one', 'problem', 'when', 'music', 'dance', 'voice-over', 'almost', 'inaudible', 'only', 'lasted', 'few', 'seconds', 'None', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'took', 'away', 'overall', 'experience', 'film', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'over', 'definitely', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'more', 'subsequent', 'watch.10/10', 'Classic']",Education Of Charlie Banks

Going in with an open mind however I found an authentic and surprisingly grounded drama with some great performances.  We have all had personalities in our lives, the ones that are bigger than life and seem to survive only out of sheer will.  Here Jason Ritter does an exceptional job portraying one of those types who seem to pass through our lives at impressionable ages.  The antagonist/protagonist roles are blurred a little here as the leads are allowed to show different sides of their personalities.  While the storyline itself doesn't exactly break ground there is an overall feeling of reality that really aids this film.  The music is bit much and is way too loud in the mix, but the film editing and fine performances make up for this oversight.  Really a surprise to find a retro NY growing up story that doesn't exploit the era and its music relentlessly as well.

1250108,AQ2UN38CMK119,B0024HH2WG,P. Mann,"[3, 5]","Growing up, Charlie and Mick encounter each other a few times, most importantly at a party while Charlie is in high school. There, Mick nearly kills two other boys who challenge him to a fight. After that, Charlie tells the police and then recants, deciding it is better not to risk retaliation. For a few years, he avoids Mick until he moves away to college. Then, one day, Charlie returns to his dorm to find Mick there. Always nervous around the violent Mick, Charlie watches uneasily as Mick stays and stays, joining in on the activities Charlie participates in, including poker games, classes, trips with Charlie's wealthy friend, and even a formal dance. During this, Mick hits it off with the woman Charlie not so subtly desires.The title is, I think, somewhat misleading, for Mick is the one who learns more than Charlie. The product of a broken home (to put it mildly), Mick seems to learn more at the college than Charlie does. Mick even readsThe Great Gatsby(the first book he has read cover to cover) and is able to quote the last line from memory. (I confess that I love ""The Great Gatsby"" and find the last few lines some of the most beautiful in literature, but they fall flat coming from Mick.) Eventually, Mick had more and more trouble fitting in, though he does learn ofJacques Derridaand deconstructionism.This film has its heart in the right place, I think, and I found it easy to watch. But the film does not achieve its aim and seems to miss the main issue of class, despite multiple opportunities to explore it in greater depth. As I watched the film, I kept recalling Whit Stilman'sMetropolitanand, of course,The Great Gatsby, but too often I was thinking of them in the sense of ""This film wants to be one of them.""

A little bit dorky, neurotic looking kid is likable enough to be generally accepted amongst his friends mainly because he is honest, loyal and smart.During his high school years, Charlie runs into a young thug Mick.  Mick is popular and charismatic.  Everyone seems to be attracted to him, boys, girls, good kids and troubled kids.  After Charlie sees the worst part of Mick's troubled personality his initial response is to report him to police.  But fear and strong desire for social acceptance amongst his peers make him change his mind and drop testimony - which leaves Mick free and out on the street.Years later, Charlie and his best friends are in the Ivy League College.  Most of Charlie's friends are rich trust fund kids but they take him under their wings because he is likable and witty.  Before long, Mick unexpectedly appears at Charlie's college and manages to blend in with Charlie's friends.  He even starts dating Charlie crush.  Until one day, it all changes for all parties involved.  Seeing true side of Mick is devastating to all.  And it turns out to be avaluable lesson in life for all involved.  If anything, there is a moment where Mick was able to capture his own humanity, humility and hope that he can be forgiving and kind only if it means to one and only person in his entire life.I absolutely loved Jason Ritter's performance (he plays Mick).

I find myself unable to fully articulate the failure and I am still entertained and fascinated by the modern setting and actors.

The acting and ambitious story line (the director plays with serious themes) were both solid attempts. Yet the whole enterprise left me rather cold. I think one of the most bothersome things about the film was the choice to set it in the 1970s...not that there's anything wrong with that. But when a film (or a book or a play) is set in a specific time period, I think there should be a reason for it. Otherwise, it's distracting and you ending up watching it and wondering, ""Okay, what is the artist trying to say about that period? How did the period play into the artistic thesis?"" With this film, the question was unanswerable; it could have been set just as easily in current times.

The film takes you on a journey from the three main characters Charlie (Jesse Eisenberg), Mick (Jason Ritter) and Danny (Christopher Marquette) growing up in Greenwich Village, New York to their life at the privileged Ivy League Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1980. Charlie and Danny are upper class who cross paths with the street tough Mick, whose raw charms befriend their circle of Vassar friends, including the girl who Charlie adores, Mary (Eva Amurri). The movie is beautifully filmed from the fenced in playgrounds in Greenwich Village to the beautifully manicured lawns of Vassar College.The film keeps you watching, as you cannot guess how this drama of the street wise Mick, who has integrated himself into Charlie's life at Vassar, will end. This film was a winner in the Made in NY Award, from the Tribeca Film Festival. Special Features include Audio Commentary with director Fred Durst and actor Jason Ritter, with Conversations Behind the movie. The one actor who stands out with real star quality in this film is Jason Ritter who plays the tough, street wise Mick. He has the natural handsome good looks that remind me of a combination of Jim Morrison and Matt Dillon. Jason plays Mick in a very Dr.Jekyl/Mr.Hyde sort of way with a cruel personality that is loaded with raw charisma.

There is an underlying tension throughout the film, based on what we know about Mick, what we suspect, and the forces operating to come into inevitable conflict.  Eisenberg (""Adventureland"") turns in a natural performance complete with downcast eyes, jerky gestures, and awkward gait.  The film is a variation on the coming-of-age movie for which Hollywood has a passion, since it layers on themes of personal responsibility,  loyalty and peer pressure, and doesn't just settle on a first-love melodrama.

1250118,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0024HH2WG,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[4, 7]","I must confess that when I saw that ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" was directed by Fred Durst, my skin began to crawl and I felt the urge to dry heave.  If you couldn't already figure it out, I am not a big fan of Mr. Durst or the band he fronts, ""Limp Bizkit"".  Nevertheless, I have watched many different types of films in my days so I figure I'd give this movie a go.The plot of this movie is very extensional in nature.  Charlie Banks is played by Jesse Eisenberg (who looks like he could be related to Charles Fleischer, the voice of Roger Rabbit).  The movie basically starts off with Charlie as a high school student in the late 1970s.  One night Charlie is at a party with his friends and witnesses a fight between two jocks and Mick (Jason Ritter).Mick is your typical loner and/or bad boy.  He came from a rough family background and doesn't take any crap, when there is conflict it is resolved with his fists.  Well during this fight Mick almost kills these two jocks.  Charlie feels conflicted about the matter and then reports it to the police.  However, Charlie doesn't want to seem like a snitch so he decides that he doesn't want to go forward with his confession.  Since Charlie was the only witness who stepped forward, all charges against Mick are dropped.Now fast forward about three to four years.  We are in the early 1980s and Charlie is going to college.  It appears that Charlie has matured a bit, he appears a bit more seasoned with regards to intelligence, despite the fact he is still rather meek.  He is living in a dorm with Danny (Chris Marquette) who Charlie went to high school with and has a major crush on a girl named Mary (Eva Amurri).Life seems to be going really well until one day Mick shows back up.  Charlie immediately regresses to his high school years.  Well to make a long story short, Mick starts hanging out with Charlie and his friends, even starts ""seeing"" Mary.  Charlie grapples to let bygones be bygones, knowing the person Mick was and embrace the idea that Mick has changed since Charlie last saw him.It soon is discovered that Mick hasn't changed his ways too much and has still endorsed havoc since the days of high school.  Charlie is then presented with the notion ""If I had gone through with my confession, none of this would have happened"" with regards to Mick's current path of disorder.This movie was much better than I expected, it really raises some philosophical and moral issues about cause and effect.  The elemental concept that one event influences another and in life there are no answers only choices. This resulted in a very unique story. The acting was very solid, Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Ritter shined as the two leads.  As for Jason Ritter, in some angles he looks just like his father (the late John Ritter).In contrast, I felt the movie was very slow and clunky in parts.  I suppose the pace was to aid character development, I feel it made the film lag.  Another dubious factor in this film was Mick living indefinitely on a college campus without being a student.  I didn't attend college in the early 1980s, so who knows.  However, I remember when I went to college, people couldn't just ""hang around"" or just sit randomly in a classroom and make remarks without being enrolled.  Not to mention that Mick wasn't working, so where was he getting money to eat, smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol?  These former factors keep this film from being a four star movie, but it is definitely a solid three stars.With regards to Fred Durst, I have to tip my hat to him.  For his directorial debut he really did a solid job.  I am not sure if film making is his true calling or not, but this movie definitely overshadows any of the music that he has produced, in my humble opinion.  So if you are in the mood for a coming of age story that is extensional/ philosophical in nature, then get ""educated"" with Charlie Banks.",3,A unique twist on a coming of age tale,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,3894,"['must', 'confess', 'when', 'saw', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'was', 'directed', 'Fred', 'Durst', 'skin', 'began', 'crawl', 'felt', 'urge', 'dry', 'heave', 'could', ""n't"", 'already', 'figure', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Mr.', 'Durst', 'band', 'Limp', 'Bizkit', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'films', 'days', 'so', 'figure', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'go.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'very', 'extensional', 'nature', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'related', 'Charles', 'Fleischer', 'voice', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'movie', 'basically', 'Charlie', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'late', '1970s', 'One', 'night', 'Charlie', 'party', 'friends', 'fight', 'two', 'jocks', 'Mick', 'Jason', 'Ritter', '.Mick', 'typical', 'loner', 'bad', 'boy', 'came', 'rough', 'family', 'background', ""n't"", 'take', 'crap', 'when', 'conflict', 'resolved', 'fists', 'Well', 'fight', 'Mick', 'almost', 'two', 'jocks', 'Charlie', 'feels', 'conflicted', 'matter', 'then', 'reports', 'police', 'However', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'want', 'seem', 'snitch', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'forward', 'confession', 'Charlie', 'was', 'only', 'witness', 'who', 'stepped', 'forward', 'charges', 'Mick', 'are', 'dropped.Now', 'fast', 'forward', 'three', 'four', 'years', 'are', 'early', '1980s', 'Charlie', 'going', 'college', 'Charlie', 'matured', 'bit', 'bit', 'more', 'seasoned', 'regards', 'intelligence', 'fact', 'still', 'rather', 'meek', 'living', 'dorm', 'Danny', 'Chris', 'Marquette', 'who', 'Charlie', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'major', 'crush', 'girl', 'named', 'Mary', 'Eva', 'Amurri', '.Life', 'be', 'going', 'really', 'well', 'one', 'day', 'Mick', 'back', 'up', 'Charlie', 'immediately', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'Well', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'Mick', 'hanging', 'out', 'Charlie', 'friends', 'even', 'seeing', 'Mary', 'Charlie', 'let', 'bygones', 'be', 'bygones', 'knowing', 'person', 'Mick', 'was', 'embrace', 'idea', 'Mick', 'changed', 'Charlie', 'last', 'saw', 'him.It', 'soon', 'discovered', 'Mick', ""n't"", 'changed', 'ways', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'endorsed', 'havoc', 'days', 'high', 'school', 'Charlie', 'then', 'presented', 'notion', 'had', 'gone', 'confession', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'regards', 'Mick', 'current', 'path', 'disorder.This', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'really', 'philosophical', 'moral', 'issues', 'cause', 'effect', 'elemental', 'concept', 'one', 'event', 'life', 'are', 'answers', 'only', 'choices', 'resulted', 'very', 'unique', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'shined', 'two', 'leads', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'angles', 'just', 'father', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', '.In', 'contrast', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'clunky', 'parts', 'suppose', 'pace', 'was', 'aid', 'character', 'development', 'feel', 'made', 'film', 'lag', 'dubious', 'factor', 'film', 'was', 'Mick', 'living', 'indefinitely', 'college', 'campus', 'being', 'student', 'did', ""n't"", 'attend', 'college', 'early', '1980s', 'so', 'who', 'However', 'remember', 'when', 'went', 'college', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'hang', 'around', 'just', 'sit', 'randomly', 'classroom', 'make', 'remarks', 'being', 'enrolled', 'Not', 'mention', 'Mick', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'so', 'where', 'was', 'getting', 'money', 'eat', 'smoke', 'cigarettes', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'former', 'factors', 'keep', 'film', 'being', 'four', 'star', 'movie', 'definitely', 'solid', 'three', 'stars.With', 'regards', 'Fred', 'Durst', 'have', 'tip', 'hat', 'directorial', 'debut', 'really', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'making', 'true', 'calling', 'not', 'movie', 'definitely', 'music', 'produced', 'humble', 'opinion', 'So', 'are', 'mood', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'extensional/', 'philosophical', 'nature', 'then', 'get', 'educated', 'Charlie', 'Banks']",Education Of Charlie Banks
