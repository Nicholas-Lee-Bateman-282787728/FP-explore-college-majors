1594235,AM18CU72YEWH5,B009AVCAE4,A. J Terry,"[20, 25]","Titanic:  Blood and Steel will probably be eclipsed by more conventional Titanic movies that focus on the disaster.  It's really a very intelligent drama, focusing not so much on the sheer process of ship building as on labor negotiations, class tensions, religious discrimination, feminism, idealism, and politics. (Where else will you find heartwarming slogans like ""We're going to take engineering back from the accountants!"") The characters often debate politics, ethics, and engineering; you may or may not like this sort of thing; I did. The vocabulary is refreshingly sophisticated. The series shows what is apparently a real ship being built in a real shipyard, with lots of gritty industrial shots. Belfast is convincingly cobblestoned and dirty (I was reminded of Pittsburgh, in its steel and coal days).I was, therefore, disappointed by the lack of realism in other areas. Criticisms in Wikipedia include things like the purported Titanic being built on the slip where in reality the Olympic was built. Most viewers won't know that or care. But most *will* know that the Titanic was not bigger than its sister ship the Olympic, that the ""unsinkable"" marketing slogan was not generated by an engineer (who would have had more sense), and some other blatant errors. Even more important, for a movie that focuses on social change, this one is appallingly ignorant of early 20th-century society.  Women did not commonly have sex before marriage and whether they did or not, their goal was marriage and they did their best to guide the man towards it, not have an endless on-off relationship like several in this movie. Tycoons did not disinherit an only child/daughter who refused to marry the supremely stupid son of a wealthy man. (Why would anyone want a stupid son-in-law to inherit and manage his vast, complicated, multimillion business empire? And another wealthy groom could always be found.) People did not constantly say ""huh"" and ""yeah"" and ""have a nice day."" And my pet peeve--why are movies now referring to the ship as ""Titanic,"" as if it were a person, instead of ""the Titanic""?Plotwise, this is not exactly a soap opera. It's not divided into story segments that fit neatly into episodes. The drama goes on as if this were a twelve-hour movie (which is how I watched the DVD, on six successive evenings). Most stories drag a bit while the numerous major characters waffle about important life decisions--this series would have worked better as ten episodes. In the last two, the characters finally make up their minds and definitively plan their futures. The movie makers definitely rose in my estimation here, because for most characters this means sailing on the Titanic, whether in first class or third class. They're seen off with tearful hugs, but everyone is full of optimism for a brighter future.And that's it. You don't see the ship sink, and there's no text epilog.  Aside from one or two real historical characters, you'll never know who was and was not saved.",4,"Good, different, but flawed",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,2994,"['Titanic', 'Blood', 'Steel', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'eclipsed', 'more', 'conventional', 'Titanic', 'movies', 'focus', 'disaster', 'really', 'very', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'focusing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sheer', 'process', 'ship', 'building', 'labor', 'negotiations', 'class', 'tensions', 'religious', 'discrimination', 'feminism', 'idealism', 'politics', 'Where', 'else', 'will', 'find', 'heartwarming', 'slogans', ""'re"", 'going', 'take', 'engineering', 'back', 'accountants', 'characters', 'often', 'debate', 'politics', 'ethics', 'engineering', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'did', 'vocabulary', 'refreshingly', 'sophisticated', 'series', 'what', 'apparently', 'real', 'ship', 'being', 'built', 'real', 'shipyard', 'lots', 'gritty', 'industrial', 'shots', 'Belfast', 'convincingly', 'cobblestoned', 'dirty', 'was', 'reminded', 'Pittsburgh', 'steel', 'coal', 'days', '.I', 'was', 'therefore', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'realism', 'other', 'areas', 'Criticisms', 'Wikipedia', 'include', 'things', 'purported', 'Titanic', 'being', 'built', 'slip', 'where', 'reality', 'Olympic', 'was', 'built', 'Most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'care', 'most', '*will*', 'know', 'Titanic', 'was', 'not', 'bigger', 'sister', 'ship', 'Olympic', 'unsinkable', 'marketing', 'slogan', 'was', 'not', 'generated', 'engineer', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'sense', 'other', 'blatant', 'errors', 'Even', 'more', 'important', 'movie', 'social', 'change', 'one', 'appallingly', 'ignorant', 'early', '20th-century', 'society', 'Women', 'did', 'not', 'commonly', 'have', 'sex', 'marriage', 'did', 'not', 'goal', 'was', 'marriage', 'did', 'best', 'guide', 'man', 'not', 'have', 'endless', 'on-off', 'relationship', 'several', 'movie', 'Tycoons', 'did', 'not', 'disinherit', 'only', 'child/daughter', 'who', 'refused', 'marry', 'supremely', 'stupid', 'son', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'stupid', 'son-in-law', 'inherit', 'manage', 'vast', 'complicated', 'multimillion', 'business', 'empire', 'wealthy', 'groom', 'could', 'always', 'be', 'found', 'People', 'did', 'not', 'constantly', 'say', 'huh', 'yeah', 'have', 'nice', 'day', 'pet', 'peeve', 'why', 'are', 'movies', 'now', 'referring', 'ship', 'Titanic', 'were', 'person', 'instead', 'Titanic', 'Plotwise', 'not', 'exactly', 'soap', 'opera', 'not', 'divided', 'story', 'segments', 'fit', 'neatly', 'episodes', 'drama', 'were', 'twelve-hour', 'movie', 'how', 'watched', 'DVD', 'six', 'successive', 'evenings', 'Most', 'stories', 'drag', 'bit', 'numerous', 'major', 'characters', 'waffle', 'important', 'life', 'decisions', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'ten', 'episodes', 'last', 'two', 'characters', 'finally', 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'definitively', 'plan', 'futures', 'movie', 'makers', 'definitely', 'rose', 'estimation', 'here', 'most', 'characters', 'sailing', 'Titanic', 'first', 'class', 'third', 'class', ""'re"", 'seen', 'off', 'tearful', 'hugs', 'everyone', 'full', 'optimism', 'brighter', 'future.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'ship', 'sink', 'text', 'epilog', 'Aside', 'one', 'two', 'real', 'historical', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'saved']",N/A

1594237,AZT3AX3A4O809,B009AVCAE4,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This was a very enjoyable historical fiction, set in the Belfast shipyard as HMS Titanic was being built.You should be aware that it is also a glossy tribute to all causes socialistic and ""progressive."" As long as you know that going in, and don't take the story as anything more than what it is -- very slanted historical fiction -- it is very enjoyable.  Watch, but take it is a not-completely-true tale...at the very least, it carefully omits facts that would be inconvenient to the progressive movement.What was most enjoyable about the film was the gritty context it gave to the Belfast of the pre-WW1 era.  Labor vs. business.  Catholics vs. Protestants.  Rich vs. Poor.  Elite leisure classes s vs. the heavily-burdened working classes.  Lots of dirty, grusome realities ARE depicted with honesty...it's just that only half of the tale is presented.For the most part it isn't racy, with the clear exception of a tarty rich girl who can't/won't keep her knickers on, will only marry for money, cheats on boyfriend/fiance, plans to cheat on her husband, and pretty much throws herself at any male that isn't her fiance.  But 99% of that is verbal, only a bit of flesh gets flashed.  Probably not for below age 12, IMHO.When your teens watch it...make sure they understand that it is only a one-sided view, at least politically.  Talk it over with them...give them some facts.  For example, the labor/union movements also utilized extremely violent tactics...not just the rich businessmen.  Yes, there were German spies in pre-WW1 Europe...but none that actually worked for JP Morgan.  Yes, the labor unions were much needed to bring some balance back to the business vs. labor relationship...but today's balance is very much out of whack the other direction (as evidence by the fleecing taxpayers received in bailing out GM).While the show ends with the Titanic just starting its infamous maiden (and final) voyage, you should also take the opportunity to discuss some of the realities of that sinking, and how the truth generally differs from the oft-filmed discrepancies.  Discus with them, for example, that many tales about the Titanic's sinking--such as the oft-repeated claims that the steerage passengers were locked below decks--are purely myth, with zero foundation in truth.  Remind them that by and large, the men--rich and poor alike--stood aside and ensured ""women and children first"" into the lifeboats; even as those men realized they would be dead within hours/minutes, they stood their ground and died as heroes.Yes, I'd watch it again.  Yes, I recommend it (I did rate it at 5 stars, after all).

1594244,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B009AVCAE4,Charity Bishop,"[4, 9]","It's been awhile since a miniseries this good crossed the Atlantic. ""Titanic: Blood & Steel"" proves there are still ways to approach material that has been revisited on the big and small screens in new and appealing ways. From the laying of the hull to her departure from Belfast, this is the story of the workers, businessmen, and common Irishmen impacted through the construction process of the most famous ship in history.The year is 1909. American businessman J.P. Morgan (Chris Noth) has provided the financial banking for three magnificent ships, his favorite among them the RMS Titanic. Ambitious young Marc Meur (Kevin Zegers) is eager to be in at the ground floor. Fresh off steel-testing for an American warship, he offers his services to Morgan's business partner Lord Pirrie (Derek Jacobi) to ensure that their ship is the safest, most reliable vessel at sea. Taken under the wing of the ship's designer, Thomas Andrews (Billy Carter), it doesn't take Marc long to settle in... and start having serious doubts about the way Titanic is being constructed. But that is the least of Belfast's problems.The shipping yard is faced with strife when popular liberal unionist Jim Larkin (Liam Cunningham) tries to rally the Irish workers. Lovely young copier Sofia (Alessandra Mastronardi) is caught up in the movement, much to the distress of her traditional Italian father. Then, there is the aristocratic Kitty (Ophelia Lovibond), vying for the attention of Marc. Over three years, the miniseries plays out against a backdrop of political upheaval and unrest, board inquiries as to whether or not the White Star ships are ""too big,"" and the collision of the Olympic's impact on the construction of Titanic's hull.The series' strengths are its historical figures, such as the open-minded Pirrie (Jacobi at his finest) and the perfectionist, driven Andrews, who is depicted as I have always imagined him to be, soft-spoken and heroic. Its weaknesses lie in its lack of understanding for the social and sexual aspects of the period as well as its unlikable leading man. When it comes to historical accuracy, it relies more on fiction than fact to tell its story but somehow it never seems too troubling. The politics of the era are explored: the struggle to unionize Ireland, the rivalries between Catholic and Protestant fractions, even a foray into the beginnings of the Irish Republican Army.It's an expensive miniseries and it shows not only in the terrific cast but the incredible detail on the ships, their construction, the shipyards, and the lavish interiors. It's proof that no topic is ever overdone to such an extent that it can't be approached through a new perspective. The conclusion is ominous and the futures of everyone (save poor Andrews) are unclear, for the series ends as Titanic embarks on her icy maiden voyage with most of the main cast aboard. Some might see its abrupt conclusion as disappointing, but for me it left the characters in a happy situation that enables us to make up our own conclusion toward their fates -- whether or not our preferences are practical.While I didn't like all its nuances, it held my attention and gave me twelve hours spent in the companionship of Lord Pirrie and Thomas Andrews... and as an amateur RMS Titanic historian, for that, I'm grateful.",4,"Terrific ""New Take"" on the RMS Titanic",1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,3306,"['been', 'awhile', 'miniseries', 'good', 'crossed', 'Atlantic', 'Titanic', 'Blood', 'Steel', 'are', 'still', 'ways', 'approach', 'material', 'been', 'revisited', 'big', 'small', 'screens', 'new', 'appealing', 'ways', 'laying', 'hull', 'departure', 'Belfast', 'story', 'workers', 'businessmen', 'common', 'Irishmen', 'impacted', 'construction', 'process', 'most', 'famous', 'ship', 'history.The', 'year', '1909', 'American', 'businessman', 'J.P.', 'Morgan', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'provided', 'financial', 'banking', 'three', 'magnificent', 'ships', 'favorite', 'RMS', 'Titanic', 'Ambitious', 'young', 'Marc', 'Meur', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'eager', 'be', 'ground', 'floor', 'Fresh', 'steel-testing', 'American', 'warship', 'services', 'Morgan', 'business', 'partner', 'Lord', 'Pirrie', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'ensure', 'ship', 'safest', 'most', 'reliable', 'vessel', 'sea', 'Taken', 'wing', 'ship', 'designer', 'Thomas', 'Andrews', 'Billy', 'Carter', ""n't"", 'take', 'Marc', 'long', 'settle', 'start', 'having', 'serious', 'doubts', 'way', 'Titanic', 'being', 'constructed', 'least', 'Belfast', 'problems.The', 'shipping', 'yard', 'faced', 'strife', 'when', 'popular', 'liberal', 'unionist', 'Jim', 'Larkin', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'rally', 'Irish', 'workers', 'Lovely', 'young', 'copier', 'Sofia', 'Alessandra', 'Mastronardi', 'caught', 'up', 'movement', 'much', 'distress', 'traditional', 'Italian', 'father', 'Then', 'aristocratic', 'Kitty', 'Ophelia', 'Lovibond', 'vying', 'attention', 'Marc', 'three', 'years', 'miniseries', 'out', 'backdrop', 'political', 'upheaval', 'unrest', 'board', 'inquiries', 'not', 'White', 'Star', 'ships', 'are', 'too', 'big', 'collision', 'Olympic', 'impact', 'construction', 'Titanic', 'hull.The', 'series', 'strengths', 'are', 'historical', 'figures', 'such', 'open-minded', 'Pirrie', 'Jacobi', 'finest', 'perfectionist', 'driven', 'Andrews', 'who', 'depicted', 'have', 'always', 'imagined', 'be', 'soft-spoken', 'heroic', 'weaknesses', 'lie', 'lack', 'understanding', 'social', 'sexual', 'aspects', 'period', 'as', 'well', 'unlikable', 'leading', 'man', 'When', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'more', 'fiction', 'fact', 'tell', 'story', 'somehow', 'never', 'too', 'troubling', 'politics', 'era', 'are', 'explored', 'struggle', 'unionize', 'Ireland', 'rivalries', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'fractions', 'even', 'foray', 'beginnings', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army.It', 'expensive', 'miniseries', 'not', 'only', 'terrific', 'cast', 'incredible', 'detail', 'ships', 'construction', 'shipyards', 'lavish', 'interiors', 'proof', 'topic', 'ever', 'overdone', 'extent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'approached', 'new', 'perspective', 'conclusion', 'ominous', 'futures', 'everyone', 'save', 'poor', 'Andrews', 'are', 'unclear', 'series', 'Titanic', 'icy', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'most', 'main', 'cast', 'aboard', 'might', 'see', 'abrupt', 'conclusion', 'disappointing', 'left', 'characters', 'happy', 'situation', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'conclusion', 'fates', 'not', 'preferences', 'are', 'practical.While', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'nuances', 'held', 'attention', 'gave', 'twelve', 'hours', 'spent', 'companionship', 'Lord', 'Pirrie', 'Thomas', 'Andrews', 'amateur', 'RMS', 'Titanic', 'historian', ""'m"", 'grateful']",N/A

1594247,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B009AVCAE4,CryWolf854,"[7, 13]","I'm a Titanic junkie.  I've been interested in the ship since the fourth grade when I read my first book about it.  In high school Walter Lord meticulously detailed book A Night To Remember was a constant companion of mine.  Of course James Cameron's 1997 masterpiece was and remains one of my all time favorite movies.  This past April 15 marked the 100th anniversary of the tragic night the ship sank and took 1500 souls with it  and this year two mini-series debuted on tv.  A 4-part series Titanic dealt with a soap opera set up much like the Clifton Webb/ Barbara Stanwyck version did.  And T: Blood and Steel aired later and was a 12-part series.  As it turned out, even with all of its sappy, soapy moments, the shorter of the two is the better.While T:B&S; dealt mainly with the building of the ship, they do it in such a dull manner.  The characters are flat and seem to have no real reason to be doing what they are doing nor do the actors appear to even care about the story they are trying to tell.  And worse yet, you don't even get to see the ship sink.

1594249,A20X386HPHVGQV,B009AVCAE4,DAVID WALD,"[0, 0]","All the actresses and actors performed well beyond what I had expected.I have to take issue with one comment in regard to the ideathat Neve Campbell who plays the reporter, should not require anothersubplot involving her, for later in the movie.  Everyone that knowsabout movies in general, understands that there needs to be an endingthat would let us know what happens to all the main characters.  Withoutthat, someone focusing on a certain character will feel unrewarded.Plus the Neve Campbell character gives us knowledge of the coming Great Warof World War 1, along with the issues of women equality and worker union protests,along with ethnic and religious divisions, all causing problems during this time.All of this happening while Titanic was being built.  So it gives us more ofa feeling of the era and what was happening.  A brief mention of World War 1 wasa smart idea and it was mentioned briefly rather than throughout the movie, whichI think was correct.  People watching the movie might think during this time thatan upcoming war in Europe was about to happen.  This makes it clear that it was stillnot an important enough topic or was maybe even unexpected.  The local issues werethe main topics instead.  In fact we are aware of the upcoming war through thereporter, Neve Campbell when the spy mentions it to her (you need to watch to see whatI mean and why a spy suddenly appears).There is another reason that Neve Campbell is given attention at the end.  As I've said,in most movies you need a story arc from beginning to end.  She fits this perfectly aswe see her in the beginning, then throughout the movie, and finally performing somethingunexpected near the end.If there is a continuation of the series, she may also be doing something unexpected wherewe find out more about each person.  She might even find out about the dangers of the ship, what wasgoing to happen, etc.  I mean a reporter could be very useful in a movie like this.  She alreadyhas throughout this movie.Also, the reporter in Neve Campbell I thought was played very well all throughout the movie.  I enjoyedseeing her enough and respond to different situations, that her character gradually became more important each timeshe came up.  She was not the main character but that does not mean she was not an integral or interesting character in the movie.One final thought about Neve Campbell is that they had to find a reason for why she had to be on Titanic along with the other characters who embarked upon the ship, although at different times and entrances.  One for the poor and the other for the well to do.Anyway, that is my opinion.There is one actress that really stood out in this movie.  She is an incredible actress.  Her name is Ophelia Lovibond.  I'm not sure what the exact name of her status in society would be.  She is the daughter of a wealthy family and who hates all the boring things and demands that go with it.  Her family represents the older way of thinking which was quickly becoming extinct.  Although you might still see it now in little ways, if you think about it.  Her acting abilities and facial expressions really blew me away.  I think we should all expect great things from this particular actress.I recommend getting the dvd.  It is rare that you will find such a great series made for television.

While it's not a great series (say, on a par with ""Downton Abbey"", but then few are), it is engaging enough and kept me watching. Actor Derek Jacobi shines as Lord Pirrie and there are many other solid performances but actors I don't know as well. My least favorite character was the Italian woman, Sofia, who falls in love with Dr. Muir (Kevin Zegers). Actress Alessandra Mastronardi was good as Sofia, but her character, as written, was selfish and brooding. If I were Doc Muir, I would have happily dispatched her as a Steerage Class passenger aboard Titanic--alone. This character shows little love for man as he searches for his lost daughter; she is self absorbed in her career daydreams. Ugh. A turn off to most men even in 2012. Actress Ophelia Lovibond as Kitty is oh, so very sexy with her libertine sexuality that comes out behind the Belfast carnival tents. She's fun, froth and sex. Now I was surprised how much I came to like the character of revolutionary Emily Hill, the fiery Irish suffragette (played by talented Charlotte Bradley). I didn't especially like her radical politics (even for 1912; I would have been voted against Home Rule had I lived there), but I liked her moxie and free spirit. Ms. Bradley plays this with skill and is a scene stealer. Ultimately, what kept me from giving this series four stars is for the many historical errors (which could have been easily corrected yet weren't--that's just sloppy moviemaking). ""Artistic license"" shouldn't mean you make history up, or alter it, as you go along. No matter, it is a very good series and I don't want to scare you away from enjoying it, even the hardcore Titanic enthusiasts.

It's historical, although providing plenty of fact changes to enhance the drama. In total, it is the people, city, politics, science, religion, and companies involved in building the first of its kind, unknowing it would sink on its maiden voyage.It is a magnificent, cleverly written drama prequel to the Titanic disaster. It incorporates modern knowledge gleaned from the submerged ship structure. Like Downton Abbey--relationships between Titanic's management lead by Lord Pirrie (Derek Jacobe- Cadfael) and the shipbuilding workers are remarkable. Even romantic moments appear to soften the atmosphere of ship steel. The music is hauntingly beautiful. 1909-12 period set/costume perfection (in and outside) shows richest elegance to the pit of Belfast slums. The musical magical Irish brogue of the times is as compelling as the writing.It's hard to single out cast members; the acting is generally exceptionally well done.SUBTITLES in Eng or Spanish for a dozen 50+ min episodes.Episode 1 A City Divided  1909 NYC, JP Morgan (Chris Noth) celebrates the ship to be built.

1594275,A17JVI15BRY90P,B009AVCAE4,James T. Wheeler,"[5, 12]","The title of my review should perhaps have been, ""James Cameron, where are you?""  By his own admission, he spent over 6 months editing his epic film, ""Titanic,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett.  Cameron's editing brought the blockbuster down to 3 hours and 14 minutes.  The miniseries, ""Titanic: Blood & Steel,"" needs a similar downsizing.Although concessions have to be made for a miniseries vs. a feature film, as to length and character development, that excuse doesn't really hold up.  Perhaps the most telling thing here is that neither my wife nor myself cared for what happened to the lead characters when the miniseries ended.  Derek Jacobi and Billy Carter did good work, but the other actors and overall story came up short.  We were just glad that the piece was over and that the film's arguing, fighting, and disconnected plot lines had stopped.There were a few features of this miniseries that might be helpful in a historical sense.  One was the aspect of getting the people in Belfast to stop bickering and shooting each other in order to finally build a ship.  Another might be the inferior nature of the steel used in the early-1900's which was surely a factor in Titanic's demise.  Finally, the special effects in showing ship construction and launch were first rate.  Too bad the accompanying drama didn't keep pace.Beyond these elements, the endless labor strife, class warfare, and squalor of Belfast 100 years ago wears rather thin.  The romance that was depicted was nowhere near as compelling as what James Cameron put on the screen in 1997.  And the heavy accents of the foreign actors in ""Titanic: Blood & Steel"" made following dialogue a struggle.Summing up, we can't give this miniseries more than two stars in our rating when compared to other productions.  A lot of time, money, and effort obviously went into ""Titanic: Blood & Steel.""

1594278,A1O81FLRG50RHQ,B009AVCAE4,J. Kent Layton,"[19, 29]","As a maritime and Titanic author and historian, I was quite interested to see this production, as it focused on the construction of the legendary liner and came at things from a unique perspective. Unfortunately, I am beyond disappointed (appalled would be a more apt word) by the historical errors that made their way into the miniseries.I have been working my way through the 12-part miniseries, trying desperately not to shred the arms of my chair or grinding my teeth to powder in so doing. Although the production might be an enjoyable piece if it were purely fictional, the history of the Titanic became a tragic, jumbled mess in this production.In some respects I found that it captured the period. However even there the effect was not complete; for example, the ""jazz"" music in the early-episode society scenes was about 10-15 years too premature, and that's something that anyone could get right.Was it poor research that caused this historical monstrosity? Apparently not. Why? Because of how many little details they apparently had easy access to and saw fit to include in the production (i.e., the number of passengers on Olympic's crossing where she tangled with the Hawke, the design of the Great Gantry, the fact that the riveters were paid by the rivet, the way the rivet seals were tested, the name of the British Board of Trade inspector, etc.). Meanwhile, the production included an overwhelming number of serious historical errors, many of which were easier to ""get right"" than the aforementioned factoids.Included in this list of grievous technical and historical mistakes are:* The ""fact"" that J. P. Morgan bankrolled and exercised great influence in the design and construction of the vessels. White Star paid for the vessels, and Ismay and White Star, rather than Morgan directly, had primary influence in the design and construction;* The steel issues, which is an older theory which has really been addressed and is blown entirely out of proportion in this production;* The blueprints for the Titanic shown from the opening credits through every episode, and which are actually, in every instance I noticed, of the Lusitania;* The slip that the Titanic was built on in the show is actually Olympic's slip;* The ""fact"" that the Olympic/Hawke collision (September 20, 1911) took place long before the launch of the Titanic (May 31, 1911) (???!!!);* The term ""unsinkable"" (or ""practically unsinkable"") is dreamed up and applied primarily to Titanic by the fictional character after the collision with the Hawke, when in reality it was introduced by White Star publicity and period Trade journals such as The Shipbuilder during construction of the two liners, and was applied to both equally. (Coincidentally, the special number of The Shipbuilder in which the term appeared is seen in the series long before Muir supposedly dreamed up the term);* The damage to the Olympic appears on the forward-port quarter of the hull, rather than the aft-starboard quarter;* Ismay saying that the Titanic would be 'much larger' than the Olympic;* Ismay didn't even have a speaking part, I don't believe, until the third episode;* The timing of any discussion regarding the possibilities of a double hull would have been back around 1907-1908 and applied to both ships, and would not have been applied solely to Titanic after the collision between the Olympic and the Hawke (in the end, a double-bottom was adopted for each);* The complete out-of-character, irritated, gruff behavior of Thomas Andrews throughout much of the first half of the series;* The worries within the yard that Titanic was just ""too big"" (the Germans were already starting work on the Imperator, which was still larger);* BOT Inspector Francis Carruthers was on site virtually every day of construction, yet he is not seen - until what, the fifth episode? - when he is lethargically tapping a couple of rivets. The implication is that Carruthers and the BOT exercised no real authority or oversight during construction, when in reality the original documentation and correspondence shows that they did not always see 'eye-to-eye' and had to work together to reach satisfactory results for both;* The concept that Harland & Wolff paid an unusually small amount of money to laborers (for the period, mind you) or were extraordinarily ungenerous in paying out benefits to families of those who were injured or killed in their yard (again, for the period). The record of payout benefits given to injured workers or to the families of those killed during construction of the two ships is still available and is actually quite high for the period.The list of egregious historical blunders just goes on and on. They are quite shocking in this series, especially since someone involved with the production/screenplay writing so clearly had access to little factoids that they saw fit to include. It was so badly done that I began to see in the fictional Muir character shades of the German Second Officer from the Nazi propaganda film, where he was the sole voice of reason warning everyone that the ship was doomed.If one even bothers to watch this miniseries, don't take anything in it as fact unless it is checked against leading research on the subject.

I usually enjoy historical dramas, but this one was very soap-opera like and was very slow in development.  I was disappointed with it.  I felt like Dr. Muir was a bit of a prat and it took away from my enjoyment of the whole thing.  It felt like there were so many different storylines going on, that I had a hard time figuring what the series was about.  Was it about political and religious strife in Belfast?  Was it about the class differences between the poor and rich?  Was it about the war and spies?  Was it about a bunch of hopping in the sack with little regard for the consequences?  Or was it about this ship, what was it called again, oh yeah, the Titanic...Spoiler Alert:Dr. Muir's lack of morals was put into the spotlight when he found out that he was father to a child whose mother died in childbirth and he spent a ton of time looking for the daughter he lost.  This, however, did not stop him from sleeping with yet another girl he was not married to, Sofia.  And, funny enough, Sofia's sister's unplanned pregnancy did not keep her out of the sack with Dr. Muir.  I am not one to judge harshly on such things normally, but these things did not seem to work together for me.  They knew how babies were made, right?I just felt like it was a waste of my time.  I watched all of it in the hopes that it would get better at the end, but in the last two episodes we had montages and drama, and somehow all main characters with the exception of the rich Lord and the two parents of the Irish and Italian families got on the boat.

Do you think that you've seen every conceivable story made in relationship to the epic disaster that befell the ship on its fateful maiden voyage? Never fear, there will always be a new dramatic vantage point to be explored. The twelve part 2012 miniseries ""Titanic: Blood and Steel"" bets you'll be interested in the intrigue and conflicts that arose during the building of the vessel. That's right, ""Blood and Steel"" picks up as the concept of the Titanic is borne and ends as the ship is about to embark on its journey. None of that pesky iceberg business for this production! In many ways, ""Titanic: Blood and Steel"" is a throw back to the old-fashioned TV miniseries before premium cable channels changed the game forever with more dramatic realism and higher production values. Ironically, though, this program premiered on Encore (a premium cable network) but it still feels like a network TV endeavor. In its original broadcast, two episodes were presented each evening for six consecutive nights for a massive weeklong commitment. This is a case where having the luxury of watching the show at your own pace is undoubtedly a good thing.While there are plenty of good elements at work in this presentation, it simply feels incredibly long for the actual storylines presented! ""Titanic: Blood and Steel"" is more of a high gloss soap opera than a serious contemplation of history. That's fine, that's a perfectly reasonable narrative choice, but I just want to mention that fact quite prominently. If you come to this miniseries expecting to gain new insight into the Titanic, you might feel a bit shortchanged. And if you get annoyed by historical inaccuracies and are well versed in Titanic lore, you might also want to take a pass. The primary audience for this presentation will be those looking for a period piece serial, the Titanic itself never feels particularly relevant as a major character. Set primarily in Belfast during the ship building phase, the film alternates history with romance with social and gender inequality. Of course, this plays to 2012 social conventions, so its observations and characters never feel particularly in tune with the actual time frame they are supposed to be representing.Kevin Zegers plays the lead, a dashing metallurgist (aren't all metallurgist's dashing?) brought onto the scene to contribute scientific expertise. Shipbuilders are wary of this interloper, he challenges conventions that have been used for decades. A major subplot within ""Titanic: Blood and Steel"" centers around the inequity of the labor force and possible unionization. Liam Cunningham (always a great character actor) scores some nice moments as tensions escalate. Italian actress Alessandra Mastronardi is essentially the female lead, and while lovely, is one of the production's elements that never quite rings true. Much of this show is set among poverty and squalor, and the principle themes throughout are that management and politicians are indifferent to the struggles of the common man. Not exactly breaking new ground with that argument! We also see religious strife and the emergence of radical opposition.Truthfully, I never really cared for the imperious Zegers. Although apparently knowledgeable, he comes across a bit bratty for my taste. And the central romance is so stiff and unconvincing, maybe it's the language barrier. Derek Jacobi all but steals the show as Lord Pirrie and his presence is a welcome one. Other name actors that appear include Chris Noth as JP Morgan and his giant mustache gives a compelling performance! And Neve Campbell (where has she been?) flits in and out and has one of the most preposterous plot threads in later episodes. I certainly didn't hate ""Titanic: Blood and Steel"" but it falls into the category (for me) of once I've seen it, I will not ever rewatch it. So my recommendation on a DVD/Blu-ray purchase is rather tepid. I just hoped to give you a feel for the program to help you make a decision.

But I think the religious divide, to me at least, seamed to be  people from England Protestant controlling the native population of Ireland Catholic.  At times  I thought that they dwelled too much on the personal life stories and I wish they focused more on the actual building of the ship.  For example I would have liked to have seen more of the arguments between the engineer and the board of directors who sacrificed safety and quality for profits.  The TV show it's self is of very high quality with excellent filming and lighting.  The actors and story line were also very good.

We watched the entire series in about a week, reflecting the fact that 1) we are parents of small children with little life outside of streaming movies, and 2) this series provided a wonderful historical fiction fantasy get away.  I do wish the ship had been more of a character, but there was a great deal of historical context provided about Belfast in the days during the ship's construction.  The series looked and felt very similar to Downton Abbey, although with slightly less melodrama.  And, watching one very much helps add context to one's understanding of the political times in the other.  All in all, a great series.
