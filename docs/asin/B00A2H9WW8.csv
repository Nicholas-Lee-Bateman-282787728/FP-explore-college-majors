Is this a horror film or a morality play on today's society. Watching this film I started to remember John Travolta in Brian De Palm's version. I wonder why? And then I was thinking about Christian fundamentalists and how they portrayed in this film. Oh yes, there is a definite statement being made about Christian fundamentalism here. Horror films, like good westerns made in the 50s had a message hidden somewhere in there.",3,What about turning the other cheek?,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,516,"['What', 'old', 'axiom', 'turning', 'other', 'cheek', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'not', 'Carrie', 'case', 'horror', 'film', 'morality', 'play', 'today', 'society', 'Watching', 'film', 'started', 'remember', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palm', 'version', 'wonder', 'why', 'then', 'was', 'thinking', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'how', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Oh', 'yes', 'definite', 'statement', 'being', 'made', 'Christian', 'fundamentalism', 'here', 'Horror', 'films', 'good', 'westerns', 'made', '50s', 'had', 'message', 'hidden', 'somewhere', 'there']",Carrie

1604844,A17DE61L1M0IG1,B00A2H9WW8,Alex418,"[5, 7]","Based on a short novel by Stephen King, the original 1976 movie may have been good for its time, but the slow pace and weird editing choices just make it simultaneously boring and awkward. With this remake, I read that the people involved were going to reinvent the original and put their own spin on it. Yeah, that didn&#8217;t happen.Full spoilers here, so sorry if you somehow don&#8217;t know the story. High school outcast Carrie White lives with her crazy religious mother. She&#8217;s invited to prom by a nice popular girl&#8217;s nice popular boyfriend but the mean girl and mean boyfriend drop some pig&#8217;s blood on Carrie. Then everyone dies.The foundations for an exciting movie are here, but unfortunately this is pretty much the exact same movie we got in 1976. I watched that one a couple of months ago and scene-by-scene the story is mostly the same. They even included a weird out-of-place montage from that one and though I didn&#8217;t put them side-by-side or anything, I&#8217;m pretty sure that some of the dialogue is the exact same from the original. Granted, there are a couple of modern references (including an accidentally hilarious Tim Tebow one), and a goofy new ending has been tacked on, but this is mostly a barely updated version with a new cast. Personally, I think the climax scene at the prom might have actually been longer and slightly better in the original. Here it is surprisingly a little brief without as many creative kills (as horrible as that sounds).I had no troubles with any of the acting, though I think casting Chloe Moretz as Carrie is a bit ridiculous. She is simply way too attractive to be this much of an outcast at school. Julianne Moore as Carrie&#8217;s mother really steals the show and does a fantastic job of being a terrifying lunatic. All of the teen actors thankfully play their parts fine.Overall, there isn&#8217;t all that much to say about this new Carrie movie. I think it could be mildly enjoyable for those who have never seen the original, but keep in mind that the pace is pretty slow and there are few actual scares in this horror film, but more creepy moments involving the mother. If you had to choose between the 1976 and 2013 editions of this story, I would say go for the new one, but honestly I was hoping for a more original and more exciting remake than this.",3,Carrie 1976 All Over Again,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,2347,"['Based', 'short', 'novel', 'Stephen', 'King', 'original', '1976', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'time', 'slow', 'pace', 'weird', 'editing', 'choices', 'just', 'make', 'simultaneously', 'boring', 'awkward', 'remake', 'read', 'people', 'involved', 'were', 'going', 'reinvent', 'original', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'Yeah', 'didn', '8217', 'happen.Full', 'spoilers', 'here', 'so', 'sorry', 'somehow', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'story', 'High', 'school', 'Carrie', 'White', 'crazy', 'religious', 'mother', '8217', 'invited', 'prom', 'nice', 'popular', 'girl', '8217', 's', 'nice', 'popular', 'boyfriend', 'mean', 'girl', 'mean', 'boyfriend', 'drop', 'pig', '8217', 'blood', 'Carrie', 'Then', 'everyone', 'dies.The', 'foundations', 'exciting', 'movie', 'are', 'here', 'unfortunately', 'pretty', 'much', 'exact', 'same', 'movie', 'got', '1976', 'watched', 'one', 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'scene-by-scene', 'story', 'mostly', 'same', 'even', 'included', 'weird', 'out-of-place', 'montage', 'one', 'didn', '8217', 'put', 'side-by-side', 'anything', '8217', 'pretty', 'sure', 'dialogue', 'exact', 'same', 'original', 'Granted', 'are', 'couple', 'modern', 'references', 'including', 'accidentally', 'hilarious', 'Tim', 'Tebow', 'one', 'goofy', 'new', 'ending', 'been', 'tacked', 'mostly', 'barely', 'updated', 'version', 'new', 'cast', 'Personally', 'think', 'climax', 'scene', 'prom', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'longer', 'slightly', 'better', 'original', 'Here', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'brief', 'many', 'creative', 'kills', 'as', 'horrible', '.I', 'had', 'troubles', 'acting', 'think', 'casting', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'Carrie', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'simply', 'way', 'too', 'attractive', 'be', 'much', 'outcast', 'school', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Carrie', '8217', 'really', 'show', 'fantastic', 'job', 'being', 'terrifying', 'lunatic', 'teen', 'actors', 'thankfully', 'play', 'parts', 'fine.Overall', 'isn', '8217', 'that', 'much', 'say', 'new', 'Carrie', 'movie', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'mildly', 'enjoyable', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'keep', 'mind', 'pace', 'pretty', 'slow', 'are', 'few', 'actual', 'scares', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'creepy', 'moments', 'involving', 'mother', 'had', 'choose', '1976', '2013', 'editions', 'story', 'would', 'say', 'go', 'new', 'one', 'honestly', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'original', 'more', 'exciting', 'remake']",Carrie

WTF? When did this movie turn into She's All That with Telekinesis? And yes I do like THAT movie....but here, They aren't even trying....and we already had a very good remake that was Real close to the book. So let me 1st tackle Carrie. I saw the original when I was 16 in 1999, and Sissy Spaceck was perfect. In fact ( I was the geeky Stephen King at school) I read the book so many times I could still say it in my sleep and the same with the movie! Then I hear of the re-make in 2000; now this is where my review comes 2 a screeching hault for a  moment. This is a Very Descent remake.....I thought the coach who was Carries friend was very good (sorry if I don't  know all the actors names in this, sometimes I just memorize character names.) And Carrie was very good (They even had that great Going to Prom scene from the book.) And Ginger from Gingersnaps; was Great as the Popular girls friend who always wore that red baseball cap( THAT was the Carrie for the next Generation....So Hollywood---WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I mean are things Really THAT bad...that you have to Re-write a Remake that had NOTHING wrong with it except a few minor inconsistencies? Cause you screwed up the MAIN character 4 crying out loud! This ISN'T SHE'S ALL THAT! CARRIE IS NOT the geeky girl who's just in need of a makeover and she'll be fine, and Julianne Moore, Go back 2 Jurassic Park! Because you aren't acting ANYTHING like the mom should (and I've always been on Carrie's side, but I saw the scene in the Trailer where she says &#34;They're all going to laugh at you ....and well I laughed (and I have NEVER done that with that scene! But she sounds like she can't even read the line....So Julianne Moore...take the 1970s version of your script and Go to your closet until you get it right.....(but that's just for her to get it right to save herself some embarrassment, we Definitely Don't want her in this movie....and this new Carrie actress; whoever you are I'm going to use Telekinesis to fling you off the set....and I'm going to be Carrie (my friends gave me that nickname a while back cause Carrie's my Favorite Stephen King book and movie) And I'll make the Carrie for a New Generation.....but as for THIS horrible, one I Really would like to know when this comes out on DVD so I can buy EVERY copy, just to burn them in a High school Football field with my telekinesis....Cut and Print!",1,Yeah its the Carrie for a new generation.....Not!,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,3170,"['Hello', 'Sunnydale', 'Girl', 'here', '.Well', 'FINALLY', 'got', 'see', 'trailer', 'movie', 'know', 'cause', 'how', 'am', '..I', ""'m"", 'Classic', 'Scary', 'movie', 'Scream', 'Queen', '.or', 'like', 'watch', 'Real', 'late', 'night', 'watching', 'Scary', 'Movies', 'when', 'raining', 'thought', ""'m"", 'having', 'ALOT', 'fun', 'watching', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movies', 'Halloween', 'been', 'long', 'running', 'tradition', 'delve', 'deep', 'review', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', ""'m"", 'NOT', 'making', 'fun', 'other', 'fans', 'here', 'reason', 'used', 'Headline', 'title', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Wayne', 'World', 'movie', 'joke', 'head', 'also', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'drinking', 'Pepsi', 'saying', 'Yes', 'Choice', 'new', 'Generation', 'Okay', 'enough', 'now', 'Carrie', '2013', 'WTF', 'When', 'did', 'movie', 'turn', 'Telekinesis', 'yes', 'do', 'THAT', 'movie', '.but', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'trying', '.and', 'already', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'remake', 'was', 'Real', 'close', 'book', 'let', '1st', 'tackle', 'Carrie', 'saw', 'original', 'when', 'was', '16', '1999', 'Sissy', 'Spaceck', 'was', 'perfect', 'fact', 'was', 'geeky', 'Stephen', 'King', 'school', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'could', 'still', 'say', 'sleep', 'same', 'movie', 'Then', 'hear', 're-make', '2000', 'now', 'where', 'review', '2', 'screeching', 'hault', 'moment', 'Very', 'Descent', 'remake', 'thought', 'coach', 'who', 'was', 'Carries', 'friend', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actors', 'names', 'sometimes', 'just', 'memorize', 'character', 'names', 'Carrie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'had', 'great', 'Going', 'Prom', 'scene', 'book', 'Ginger', 'Gingersnaps', 'was', 'Great', 'Popular', 'girls', 'friend', 'who', 'always', 'wore', 'red', 'baseball', 'cap', 'was', 'Carrie', 'next', 'Generation', '.So', 'Hollywood', '-WHAT', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'DOING', 'mean', 'are', 'things', 'Really', 'bad', 'have', 'Re-write', 'Remake', 'had', 'NOTHING', 'wrong', 'few', 'minor', 'inconsistencies', 'Cause', 'screwed', 'up', 'MAIN', 'character', '4', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', ""N'T"", 'SHE', 'ALL', 'THAT', 'CARRIE', 'IS', 'NOT', 'geeky', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'need', 'makeover', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Go', 'back', '2', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'are', ""n't"", 'acting', 'ANYTHING', 'mom', 'should', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'Carrie', 'side', 'saw', 'scene', 'Trailer', 'where', '34', ""'re"", 'going', 'laugh', '.and', 'well', 'laughed', 'have', 'NEVER', 'done', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'line', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'take', '1970s', 'version', 'script', 'Go', 'closet', 'get', 'right', '..', 'just', 'get', 'right', 'save', 'embarrassment', 'Definitely', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', '.and', 'new', 'Carrie', 'actress', 'whoever', 'are', ""'m"", 'going', 'use', 'Telekinesis', 'fling', 'set', '.and', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'Carrie', 'friends', 'gave', 'while', 'back', 'cause', 'Carrie', 'Favorite', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'make', 'Carrie', 'New', 'Generation', '..but', 'THIS', 'horrible', 'one', 'Really', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'can', 'buy', 'EVERY', 'copy', 'just', 'burn', 'High', 'school', 'Football', 'field', 'telekinesis', '.Cut', 'Print']",Carrie

Green,"[14, 18]","For 38 years the original Carrie has remained one of the greatest horror movies ever made, a shining example of not only how to adapt a book into a movie, but also how to make you....Fear, so it was inevitable that a remake would be made.To not compare this film to the original is impossible. Brian De Palma's version is an immersive experience, a psychological assault on the mind, you feel what Carrie White feels. Chloe Grace Moretz is an incredible actress, but her Carrie doesn't quite project her fears and emotions into us like Sissy Spacek's did.In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie, the mother(played by Julianne Moore) nearly lacks the controlling dominance the original had over Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz's Carrie right from the start doesn't hardly fear her mother, but instead shes defiant towards her, hates her, and this is what separates this new Carrie from the original. Brian De Palma's Carrie FEARS and Kimberly Peirce's Carrie HATES.For the most part the majority of the middle of this film plays out almost identically to that of De Palma's, the actors are the only real difference. Some of the new actors are good and some are just terrible, like Judy Greer(Miss Desjardin / the P.E. teacher), she sounds so week and juvenile when shes speaking her lines it's hard to take her seriously as an authority figure.Lets fast forward to the prom scene. In Brian De Palma's Carrie after winning prom queen and king Carrie and Tommy Ross head up to the stage, this scene is gloriously shot in slow motion, eventually the blood gets poured on her and she goes into a state of absolute shock, the only sound that can be heard is the bucket swaying back and forth, then the bucket falls and hits Tommy in the head knocking him unconscious, in her state She takes no notice of whats happened to Tommy as the overwhelming fear that has enveloped her causes her to lose control unleashing her powers on all her school mates. In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie...well lets face it, the prom scene lacks the build up of the original, no slow motion, no sounds of a swaying bucket, how this scene was shot by De Palma is what made the original so fantastic. Kimberly Peirce's Carrie somewhat figures out how to control her powers, unlike De Palma's who's powers mainly activated out of fear. This time when the blood is poured on her head she doesn't go into shock, instead she nearly walks off stage before turning around after Tommy is hit by the bucket. This pushes her emotions over the edge and in a fully aware state of mind she unleashes her powers on her class mates.I personally feel nothing for Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie, it may have followed the plot of the book a little closer in some areas, but it did it with far less sophistication. It has some unique changes that make it worth a watch, but ultimately it doesn't come close to the brilliance of the original.",3,Lacks what made the original a masterpiece,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,2877,"['38', 'years', 'original', 'Carrie', 'remained', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'shining', 'example', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'adapt', 'book', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'make', '.Fear', 'was', 'inevitable', 'remake', 'would', 'be', 'made.To', 'not', 'compare', 'film', 'original', 'impossible', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'version', 'immersive', 'experience', 'psychological', 'assault', 'mind', 'feel', 'what', 'Carrie', 'White', 'feels', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'incredible', 'actress', 'Carrie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'project', 'fears', 'emotions', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'did.In', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', 'Carrie', 'mother', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'nearly', 'controlling', 'dominance', 'original', 'had', 'Carrie', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Carrie', 'right', 'start', ""n't"", 'hardly', 'fear', 'mother', 'instead', 'shes', 'defiant', 'what', 'new', 'Carrie', 'original', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Carrie', 'FEARS', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', 'Carrie', 'HATES.For', 'most', 'part', 'majority', 'middle', 'film', 'out', 'almost', 'identically', 'De', 'Palma', 'actors', 'are', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'new', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'just', 'terrible', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Miss', 'Desjardin', '/', 'P.E', 'teacher', 'so', 'week', 'juvenile', 'when', 'shes', 'speaking', 'lines', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'authority', 'figure.Lets', 'fast', 'forward', 'prom', 'scene', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Carrie', 'winning', 'prom', 'queen', 'king', 'Carrie', 'Tommy', 'Ross', 'head', 'up', 'stage', 'scene', 'gloriously', 'shot', 'slow', 'motion', 'eventually', 'blood', 'poured', 'state', 'absolute', 'shock', 'only', 'sound', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'bucket', 'swaying', 'back', 'forth', 'then', 'bucket', 'hits', 'Tommy', 'head', 'knocking', 'unconscious', 'state', 'notice', 'whats', 'happened', 'Tommy', 'overwhelming', 'fear', 'enveloped', 'causes', 'lose', 'control', 'unleashing', 'powers', 'school', 'mates', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', 'Carrie', 'well', 'face', 'prom', 'scene', 'build', 'original', 'slow', 'motion', 'sounds', 'swaying', 'bucket', 'how', 'scene', 'was', 'shot', 'De', 'Palma', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'so', 'fantastic', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', 'Carrie', 'somewhat', 'out', 'how', 'control', 'powers', 'De', 'Palma', 'who', 'powers', 'mainly', 'activated', 'fear', 'time', 'when', 'blood', 'poured', 'head', ""n't"", 'go', 'shock', 'instead', 'nearly', 'walks', 'off', 'stage', 'turning', 'around', 'Tommy', 'hit', 'bucket', 'emotions', 'edge', 'fully', 'aware', 'state', 'mind', 'powers', 'class', 'mates.I', 'personally', 'feel', 'nothing', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', 'version', 'Carrie', 'may', 'have', 'followed', 'plot', 'book', 'little', 'closer', 'areas', 'did', 'far', 'less', 'sophistication', 'unique', 'changes', 'make', 'watch', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'brilliance', 'original']",Carrie

I was extreamly disappointed to find out that they were making a re-make (Or I should say a re-re-make, if one counts the made-for-cable version they did when they were hoping to make it a TV show like the Dead Zone).  Even Stephen King woundered why they were doing a re-make.I won't tell you in this review that it was great or that it was better than the Original 1976 version with Sissy Spaceck, because it wasn't.  But I won't say that it was FREAKING awesome either.It was decent.  If I didn't have the original to compare it to, I would actually say that it was a pretty good.The bad: 1) Let's face it, it's a Re-Make.  2) Julianne Moore just wasn't as good as Piper Laurie as Carrie's hysteronically deranged, Bible thumping, religous zealot mother.  Piper Laurie as the mother in the Original 1976 scares the crap out of me.  Julianne Moore did even give me a shiver.  3) It was way to updated.  4) It lacked the intensity of the Original Carrie.The Good: 1) Chloe Grace Moretz was a very believable Carrie.  She really got into the Character.  2) The bads kids weren't such goofballs.  I actually wanted Carrie to take them out.  The original 1976 version had John travolta & nancy Alan's Character's more goofball and bumbling.  & 4) The special effects made the telekinetic parts better.

1604864,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00A2H9WW8,California Dreaming,"[0, 3]","I watched ""Case 39"" quite a while ago, and minus the ending perhaps, I thought that it was a really, really underrated horror film.  In particular, Jodelle Ferland -- the little girl who is adopted in that film, and who had unfortunately only a bit part in ""Twilight"" -- just gave me the willies.  She was horrifying, surely more scary than even Linda Blair in the original Exorcist, as Ms. Ferland played a more psychologically scary role in that film is almost all that I will say.But I will add that ""Case 39"" had some really interesting themes.  Without giving much away, at the very beginning of the film, you see her parents trying to bake her in an oven.  Of course the audience believes that the parents are more than simply abusive, but as the film wears on, you slowly but surely realize that maybe they really weren't all that bad after all.And the way that this remake starts reminds me of that film, and I actually thought that the writer and director were going to change this up a bit and explore some of those same themes that were in ""Case 39.""  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to quite go that way.  I complained before with ""The Amazing Spider Man"" (TASM) -- a film that was neither amazing nor about a man, and forget about any spiders -- that, while it's OK to do remakes, there should be a legitimate reason for them.  With that film I could see no reason for it, other than taking people's money.  But here, there surely was at least one reason:  the original ""Carrie"" was made so long ago that it was becoming somewhat dated, and special effects have really advanced.  I think that it would have been a bonus to perhaps change the tone here, and modify the themes slightly for differentiation.The cast differences between this and the original are a mixed bag.  I really liked the Amy Irving character in the original; the actress here was (sorry) more than a step down.  I believe that Piper Laurie and Julianne Moore are a wash.  But I will give a slight nod perhaps to Chloe Grace Moretz, another actress that's very good for her age -- just like Ms. Ferland, discussed above -- as I found Ms. Moretz to be slightly more believable to me.For me, with these types of films, you always have to suspend some belief.  Someone on this site once wrote that he hated the film ""The Conjuring"" because it wasn't real.  Well, of course it isn't.  The horror genre in particular is more for fright and entertainment than reality.  But here, they do make some unnecessary mistakes.  For example, the gym teacher slaps a student, and I wasn't convinced that that teacher wouldn't have been fired.  (Students have more power than teachers today, which boggles the mind.  I suppose I wish that we had that power when I was in high school, but then again, maybe not.)  And I believe that same student posts a video on YouTube that surely would have gotten her suspended, perhaps even sent to juvie.  I believe that there would have been a lawsuit as well.But overall, is it a worthy remake?  And was there a reason for making it?  I'll give it a yes and a no.  Like I already wrote, I wished they would have changed up the themes a little bit more, so I'll go with slightly more than a weak recommendation here.  Sure, ""Not a Terrible Remake"" isn't a glowing endorsement, but as for remakes go, this one's pretty good.",4,Not a Terrible Remake,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,3328,"['watched', 'Case', '39', 'quite', 'while', 'ago', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'underrated', 'horror', 'film', 'particular', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'adopted', 'film', 'who', 'had', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'bit', 'part', 'Twilight', 'just', 'gave', 'willies', 'was', 'horrifying', 'surely', 'more', 'scary', 'even', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'original', 'Exorcist', 'Ms.', 'Ferland', 'played', 'more', 'psychologically', 'scary', 'role', 'film', 'almost', 'will', 'say.But', 'will', 'add', 'Case', '39', 'had', 'really', 'interesting', 'themes', 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'see', 'parents', 'trying', 'bake', 'oven', 'course', 'audience', 'parents', 'are', 'more', 'simply', 'abusive', 'film', 'wears', 'slowly', 'surely', 'realize', 'maybe', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'way', 'remake', 'film', 'actually', 'thought', 'writer', 'director', 'were', 'going', 'change', 'up', 'bit', 'explore', 'same', 'themes', 'were', 'Case', '39', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'go', 'way', 'complained', 'Amazing', 'Spider', 'Man', 'TASM', 'film', 'was', 'amazing', 'man', 'forget', 'spiders', 'OK', 'do', 'remakes', 'should', 'be', 'legitimate', 'reason', 'film', 'could', 'see', 'reason', 'other', 'taking', 'people', 'money', 'here', 'surely', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'reason', 'original', 'Carrie', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'becoming', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'really', 'advanced', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bonus', 'perhaps', 'change', 'tone', 'here', 'modify', 'themes', 'slightly', 'differentiation.The', 'cast', 'differences', 'original', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'really', 'liked', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'character', 'original', 'actress', 'here', 'was', 'sorry', 'more', 'step', 'down', 'believe', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'are', 'wash', 'will', 'give', 'slight', 'nod', 'perhaps', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'actress', 'very', 'good', 'age', 'just', 'Ms.', 'Ferland', 'discussed', 'above', 'found', 'Ms.', 'Moretz', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'believable', 'me.For', 'types', 'films', 'always', 'have', 'suspend', 'belief', 'Someone', 'site', 'once', 'wrote', 'hated', 'film', 'Conjuring', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'Well', 'course', ""n't"", 'horror', 'genre', 'particular', 'more', 'fright', 'entertainment', 'reality', 'here', 'do', 'make', 'unnecessary', 'mistakes', 'example', 'gym', 'teacher', 'student', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'teacher', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'fired', 'Students', 'have', 'more', 'power', 'teachers', 'today', 'mind', 'suppose', 'wish', 'had', 'power', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not', 'believe', 'same', 'student', 'video', 'YouTube', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'suspended', 'perhaps', 'even', 'sent', 'juvie', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lawsuit', 'well.But', 'overall', 'worthy', 'remake', 'was', 'reason', 'making', ""'ll"", 'give', 'yes', 'already', 'wrote', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'up', 'themes', 'little', 'bit', 'more', ""'ll"", 'go', 'slightly', 'more', 'weak', 'recommendation', 'here', 'Sure', 'Not', 'Terrible', 'Remake', ""n't"", 'glowing', 'endorsement', 'remakes', 'go', 'one', 'pretty', 'good']",Carrie

Though the updating was done well, with the use of cell phones and computers,  cyber bullying.  It did help bring the story into our modern world.I didn&#8217;t  really feel very sorry for Carrie in this version.  There wasn&#8217;t enough emotion., anxiety,  or loneliness.  Carrie wasn&#8217;t afraid enough.

I was right there with her.  Sissy&#8217;s eyes could look right through you.

Although Sony had stated that the movie would be a ""re-imagining"" of the story, such is not the case. In fact, the movie is based largely upon the script for the original 1976 version that was written by Lawrence D. Cohen and directed by Brian De Palma, which itself made some significant changes to Stephen King's novel. To be sure, there were a few changes made to bring the story into the 21st century; for example, in the locker room scene where Carrie is terrified while experiencing her very first menstrual period, one of the jeering girls whips out a smart phone and shoots a video of the event, which is later posted online. Later on, at the prom, after Carrie has had the bucketful of pig's blood dumped on her, the aforementioned video is displayed on large flat screen TVs set up in the gym. Aside from those small changes (and a few others that could count as spoilers), there are only modest differences from the original script for the 1976 version.The main problem with the film is the acting. Chlo Grace Moretz tries hard, but really doesn't come across as the shy, sensitive girl who gains confidence with her new-found telekinetic powers. Julianne Moore reads many of her lines in a flat, lifeless manner, almost like she was reciting names from the telephone directory. Even the usually likable Judy Greer as the gym teacher comes off as a bit hollow. In fact the only performance that is okay is that of actress Portia Doubleday, who plays bad girl Chris; but even though she comes off as appropriately bitchy, she lacks the nuances of Nancy Allen's performance in the original. Another problem is that there is no chemistry between any of the actors, something that was in abundance in the original.The one improvement over the original are the special effects, which are used in abundance. Unfortunately, special effects are a tool to be used in conjunction with other aspects of a movie, which have been neglected here.Obviously, comparisons with the original 1976 movie are inescapable. The original version is a horror classic, with great performances (Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were both nominated for Oscars for their performances), great cinematography (the use of split screen during the carnage at the prom is terrific), a great score (by the underrated Pino Donaggio), etc. The 2013 remake is largely forgettable when compared to the original.One note about the Blu-ray: it contains two different versions of the film, or perhaps more accurately, the same film with two different endings. You can watch the theatrical version or ""theatrical version with alternate ending""; the alternate ending was deemed ""too shocking for theaters"", but I doubt that is the case. In any event, the alternate ending is a homage to the ending of the original film, with a bit of a sick twist... you have been warned.In conclusion, if you REALLY want to see the remake, then I suggest you rent the movie instead of buying it. Watch the regular theatrical version first, then go to the version with the alternate ending and skip ahead to the ending. But if you REALLY want to see a good classic horror film, then I suggest you stick with the original.",2,Inferior to the original in almost every way,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,3278,"['wife', 'purchased', 'Blu-ray', '2013', 'remake', 'CARRIE', 'yesterday', 'sat', 'down', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'Sony', 'had', 'stated', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 're-imagining', 'story', 'such', 'not', 'case', 'fact', 'movie', 'based', 'largely', 'script', 'original', '1976', 'version', 'was', 'written', 'Lawrence', 'D.', 'Cohen', 'directed', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'made', 'significant', 'changes', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'be', 'sure', 'were', 'few', 'changes', 'made', 'bring', 'story', '21st', 'century', 'example', 'locker', 'room', 'scene', 'where', 'Carrie', 'terrified', 'experiencing', 'very', 'first', 'menstrual', 'period', 'one', 'jeering', 'girls', 'out', 'smart', 'phone', 'shoots', 'video', 'event', 'later', 'posted', 'online', 'Later', 'prom', 'Carrie', 'had', 'bucketful', 'pig', 'blood', 'dumped', 'aforementioned', 'video', 'displayed', 'large', 'flat', 'screen', 'TVs', 'set', 'up', 'gym', 'Aside', 'small', 'changes', 'few', 'others', 'could', 'count', 'spoilers', 'are', 'only', 'modest', 'differences', 'original', 'script', '1976', 'version.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'acting', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'hard', 'really', ""n't"", 'come', 'shy', 'sensitive', 'girl', 'who', 'gains', 'confidence', 'new-found', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'many', 'lines', 'flat', 'lifeless', 'manner', 'almost', 'was', 'reciting', 'names', 'telephone', 'directory', 'Even', 'usually', 'likable', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'gym', 'teacher', 'off', 'bit', 'hollow', 'fact', 'only', 'performance', 'okay', 'actress', 'Portia', 'Doubleday', 'who', 'bad', 'girl', 'Chris', 'even', 'off', 'appropriately', 'bitchy', 'nuances', 'Nancy', 'Allen', 'performance', 'original', 'problem', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'something', 'was', 'abundance', 'original.The', 'one', 'improvement', 'original', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'abundance', 'Unfortunately', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'tool', 'be', 'used', 'conjunction', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'neglected', 'here.Obviously', 'comparisons', 'original', '1976', 'movie', 'are', 'inescapable', 'original', 'version', 'horror', 'classic', 'great', 'performances', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'great', 'cinematography', 'use', 'split', 'screen', 'carnage', 'prom', 'terrific', 'great', 'score', 'underrated', 'Pino', 'Donaggio', 'etc', '2013', 'remake', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'when', 'compared', 'original.One', 'note', 'Blu-ray', 'two', 'different', 'versions', 'film', 'perhaps', 'more', 'accurately', 'same', 'film', 'two', 'different', 'endings', 'can', 'watch', 'theatrical', 'version', 'theatrical', 'version', 'alternate', 'ending', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', 'deemed', 'too', 'shocking', 'theaters', 'doubt', 'case', 'event', 'alternate', 'ending', 'homage', 'ending', 'original', 'film', 'bit', 'sick', 'twist', 'have', 'been', 'warned.In', 'conclusion', 'REALLY', 'want', 'see', 'remake', 'then', 'suggest', 'rent', 'movie', 'instead', 'buying', 'Watch', 'regular', 'theatrical', 'version', 'first', 'then', 'go', 'version', 'alternate', 'ending', 'skip', 'ahead', 'ending', 'REALLY', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'suggest', 'stick', 'original']",Carrie

So, if you're looking for a lot of blood and killing after killing, you'll be disappointed.Second, below is my opinion.When I first saw its trailer in the theater, I thought it was boring, and it offered nothing new compared to the old film. So, when my friend asked me to go to this movie with him, I did not want to. However, I gave in because I favored socializing over movies. It turned out my first impression was completely wrong.The special effects in the last scene were impressive and bloody.The plot evolved from bullying and mental abuse. They were not new materials but the directing and acting made them enjoyable and believable. The director gave the actors enough time to develop their characters.The acting of Julianne Moore, Chloe Grace Moretz , and Portia Doubleday was superb. They made the movie feel so real, suspenseful, touching and in some cases unbearable.Julianne was convincingly scary as a mom.Portia was credibly tormenting as a bully.Chloe was excellent in the role of an outwardly submissive person. Her character, Carrie, had my sympathy even though I do not believe in killing people. As Gandhi said: ""An eye for an eye makes the world go blind"".The scene where Carrie was humiliated, and bullied in the washroom was brutal, terrifying and touching. Now, it touches me much more when I found out something like that did happen in reality as  revealed in the true crime show Dead Ringer - Elina and Christina.Of course, it had some logical holes but they don't affect its entertaining value.In short, it's one of the BEST that my MONEY can GET in terms of Drama, Gripping and Touching acting.

1604872,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00A2H9WW8,Chris Kennison,"[1, 3]","Steven King's first published novel was ""Carrie"" in 1974 and then two-years later in 1976, the film came. ""Carrie"" starred a relative newcomer at the age of 27 named Sissy Spacek. Spacek brought the character to life and had one of the most iconic film scenes of all time. That one scene caused young girls for ages to always look over their heads at the prom.The new version of ""Carrie"" stars Chloe Grace Moretz, who is not a newcomer, has been part of almost 30 films to date and is only 16. Moretz is a perfect casting choice for a film that was trying to emulate the original. She is the right age for an awkward high school girl with no friends and she even somewhat looks like a young Sissy Spacek. Moretz, who has been acting since she was 8, proves that she is a fine actress, effortlessly moving from shy teenage recluse to shy teenage recluse with a glimmer of hope, but at times her postures are extremely annoying and over-exaggerated; a tilted head here and a twisted shoulder there; product of pre-effect acting.Both movies, 1976 & 2013, delve into the life of a girl who is held prisoner by a religious fanatic mother and therefore has no social abilities. Although where her social abilities are virtually non-existent, she finds that she has unlimited ability of telekinesis. This is the nuts and bolts of both movies, but the problem is, the stuff in between is also pretty much the same in both movies.The new version didn't explore any new venues. After viewing the new version, I can only guess that they just wanted to retell the story to a culture of people who are more acutely aware of school bullying and spruce up the special effects when they come about. The movie plays like an old-style film experience, not overtly focusing on special effects and events and giving us a rich amount of personality, which I like, but if you're gonna make the exact same movie, you sure better make it better than the original. It wasn't.""Carrie"" 2013 isn't a bad film and I'm sure for those who haven't seen the original film it may even be a good film. From somebody who has seen the original though, it was a waste of time and effort. To make matters worse, the effects that were done in 1976 may have been from the 20th century and before HD, pixels and green screen effects, but at least the effects looked real. The effects in the new version did nothing to approve upon the original and most of the time, you can tell that Moretz is acting before the layers of effects are placed. Not to mention, many of the effects went over the top and left us with the impression that Carrie was more X-Men than high school girl with strong telekinesis.",3,NOTHING NEW except for some obvious 21st century f/x,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,2659,"['Steven', 'King', 'first', 'published', 'novel', 'was', 'Carrie', '1974', 'then', 'two-years', 'later', '1976', 'film', 'came', 'Carrie', 'starred', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'age', '27', 'named', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Spacek', 'brought', 'character', 'life', 'had', 'one', 'most', 'iconic', 'film', 'scenes', 'time', 'one', 'scene', 'caused', 'young', 'girls', 'ages', 'always', 'look', 'over', 'heads', 'prom.The', 'new', 'version', 'Carrie', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'who', 'not', 'newcomer', 'been', 'part', 'almost', '30', 'films', 'date', 'only', '16', 'Moretz', 'perfect', 'casting', 'choice', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'emulate', 'original', 'right', 'age', 'awkward', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'friends', 'even', 'somewhat', 'young', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Moretz', 'who', 'been', 'acting', 'was', '8', 'fine', 'actress', 'effortlessly', 'moving', 'shy', 'teenage', 'recluse', 'shy', 'teenage', 'recluse', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'times', 'postures', 'are', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'over-exaggerated', 'tilted', 'head', 'here', 'twisted', 'shoulder', 'product', 'pre-effect', 'movies', '1976', '2013', 'delve', 'life', 'girl', 'who', 'held', 'prisoner', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'mother', 'therefore', 'social', 'abilities', 'where', 'social', 'abilities', 'are', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'unlimited', 'ability', 'telekinesis', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'movies', 'problem', 'stuff', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'movies.The', 'new', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'explore', 'new', 'venues', 'viewing', 'new', 'version', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'just', 'wanted', 'retell', 'story', 'culture', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'acutely', 'aware', 'school', 'bullying', 'spruce', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'when', 'come', 'movie', 'old-style', 'film', 'experience', 'not', 'overtly', 'focusing', 'special', 'effects', 'events', 'giving', 'rich', 'amount', 'personality', 'like', ""'re"", 'gon', 'make', 'exact', 'same', 'movie', 'sure', 'better', 'make', 'better', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'Carrie', '2013', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'somebody', 'who', 'seen', 'original', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'effort', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'effects', 'were', 'done', '1976', 'may', 'have', 'been', '20th', 'century', 'HD', 'pixels', 'green', 'screen', 'effects', 'least', 'effects', 'looked', 'real', 'effects', 'new', 'version', 'did', 'nothing', 'approve', 'original', 'most', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'Moretz', 'acting', 'layers', 'effects', 'are', 'placed', 'Not', 'mention', 'many', 'effects', 'went', 'top', 'left', 'impression', 'Carrie', 'was', 'more', 'X-Men', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'strong', 'telekinesis']",Carrie

The book is such an easy read, and is entertaining from start to finish. It is easily one of King's best novels. The unique attribute of this story is that you already know whats going to happen, and you already know how its going to end, but that doesn't matter. It's the entire anticipation of the story that keeps the audience on edge and plagued with anxiety. With that said, I absolutely loved this movie! It reflected the novel much better than the 70's version (especially the deleted scenes). Moretz did a fantastic job playing Carrie, and Moore did a frightfully good job playing Carrie's mother. My only beef about this film is that i really wish they would have focused more on the ending. The ending in the novel is so much more elaborate and so much more destructive, it's really the payoff of the whole story, but like the 70's version, It was downplayed.

1604880,A1RQPIVASVK0RY,B00A2H9WW8,ConFu,"[2, 3]","Note: Please be careful when reading comments, although I try to stay spoiler free, others may not.I was not born when the first Carrie came out so it was quite annoying to listen to all the reviews comparing this remake to the original. Your comments of ""not as good as original"" and ""good changes for modern era"" says nothing for me. It was also annoying to see how much spoilers are revealed in the reviews too. Not everyone saw the original so don't just assume we all somehow are familiar with it. Anyway, for those that feels the same way, here's a spoiler free review FROM the new generation.To put it in one sentence, it was a bad movie (but not quite at the terrible stage). When I watched the trailer, I expected some sort of horror movie, which it is not. This is much closer to a drama movie and this is probably why I'm so disappointed. For the whole movie, you only get about 20 minutes of horror action, which wasn't really that scary but it did have a couple of good moments.

The original is always at the forefront and any attempt to improve on it would seem fruitless. Director Brian De Palma probably made the definitive Stephen King screen adaptation with his version of ""Carrie"" surpassed only by Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"".  The old adage applies here, however, that Shakespeare is constantly being remade and reinterpreted  so other classics shouldn't be immune.  What director Kimberly Peirce has achieved in modernizing King's work is making it accessible to a new audience, not unlike Baz Luhrmann's recent reworking of ""The Great Gatsby"", who may not want to be exposed to a nearly forty year old film.  Peirce also develops backstories for familiar characters and adds new flourishes that even though true to the source have you guessing as to the ultimate outcome.  There's less of a camp level on display here than in the original.  I also like that Julianne Moore does a different riff on Carrie's mother with no reference to Piper Laurie's take in the first.  The star continues to rise for Chloe-Grace Moretz with her extremely sophisticated portrayal of Carrie.  Moretz perfectly captures Carrie's timidity and insecurity in the early scenes and later her joy when discovering the empowerment of her previously untapped telekinetic skills.  In the prom scenes Moretz also shines like a swan changed from an ugly duckling, feeling the joy of her blossoming femininity and not the curse her mother berates her about.

The latest remake was a HUGE disappointment.  I almost left before the ending, but decided I'd already been tortured for over 90 minutes, so I'd just buck up and try and stomach the rest.  I am amazed by the other reviews; however, after this movie has been in circulation a little while, I don't believe anyone will find it still being rated as a 4-1/2 star movie.&#34;Carrie&#34; tells the tale of a young girl with special powers, i.e. telekenisis (the power to move objects by force of the mind).  Constantly tortured by an over-protective, uber-religious mother--not to mention just about an entire high school--Carrie dreads just about every day of her life...until she discovers her power.  After that, Carrie feels a little more focus in her life; she has something no other teenager in her school possesses, and she doesn't feel so helpless anymore.  After a very ugly scene is posted on the internet involving Carrie and her &#34;becoming a woman,&#34; one girl feels the need to try and help Carrie fit in.  This turns out to be the worst thing for everyone involved.Most of you know the rest of the story.  Scenes in the original that were poignant, tender, and so meaningful have been replaced with hurried attempts to tell a story--and LOTS of CGI.  Although Chloe Grace Moretz does a decent job as the title character, it is the rest of her cast that do this movie in.  Julieanne Moore was an absolute train wreck as her mother.  Her character portrayal was lifeless.  I'll take Piper Laurie's over-the-top portrayal anytime over the zombie-like mumblings of Moore.  I could compare (character for character) the 1976 version to this remake, and there was not ONE actor who came close to hitting the marks of the original.&#34;Carrie&#34; will hopefully die a quick death.

Though it's been a number of years since I read Stephen King's novel and saw the 1976 film version, from what I can tell, CARRIE (2013) follows the original storyline quite closely, enhancing it with smartphone photos of the infamous tampon-throwing scene and a brief episode of cyber-bullying. It's generally well-filmed, and the acting ranges from tepid to pretty good, with Julianne Moore giving an impressive performance as Carrie's mom. Without any fundamental changes to the roles they play, Carrie's fanatical mother and certain schoolmates come off as just a little more human than they did in '76. This version also gives a convincing portrayal of a contemporary high school, which is never an easy thing to do. Certain other aspects such as the English class poetry reading are skipped through quickly and cursorily, and anyone who's unfamiliar with the basic story may be left wondering how these scenes are supposed to fit into the whole. In short, it's in some ways better, in other ways worse, than CARRIE (1976).It would have been a risk, and fans of the book and ""original"" film would not have liked it, but, even if meant departing from what's in the novel, I think this version would have been better-still with more modernized details and small but significantly different twists. Though quite good, CARRIE (2013) comes off a bit too much as an update for the sake of an update.At any rate, horror fans who have never read the novel or seen CARRIE (1976) will probably find CARRIE (2013) satisfyingly unpredictable if not a little confusing.",4,"""Wherefore was my birth, from Heaven, foretold?""

I've never read the story so I'm not sure if this is more faithful to it or not? Hoping for the best, keeping my expectations low and wanting to really like this film. I watch yet another failed attempt to remake another classic with horrifying results.Moretz and Moore are more than capable of giving excellent performances and they do a fair job, although I thought neither were nearly as effective as the original versions of these characters played by Spacek and Laurie. The remake fails more in the direction department. There is no build up to the climatic ending in this remake. Even though the film is pretty much scene for scene the same film, the direction and over blown sequences show just how Hollywood has gotten away from being able to tell a good story without catering to the ADD crowd who need an explosion every 2 to 3 minutes to keep their attention.Everything in this remake is overblown, forget the simmering pot pacing of the original as it slowly builds to a heart pounding climax, the power of telekinesis in this version is so absurd and to the point of ridiculousness, her powers rival that of the strongest of X Men mutants, able to split streets and swallow up cars etc. I suppose if I had never seen the original I would have been entertained by the two leads here, but having known and loved the original it just pales by comparison on every level.

1604906,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00A2H9WW8,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[10, 12]","Unlike many people, I have no problems with remakes of classic films. Who's to say that someone else's take on a character or universe wouldn't offer something new to the cinematic world? I actually enjoyed the &#34;A Nightmare on Elm Street,&#34; &#34;Friday the 13th,&#34; and &#34;Fright Night&#34; reboots. The upcoming &#34;Robocop&#34; looks to be entertaining as well.I especially don't mind alternate versions of movies when they were originally based on a novel. Many times, one screenwriter or director's interpretations of a book can be vastly different from another's. Just look at the difference between the two &#34;Total Recall,&#34; &#34;The Shining,&#34; and &#34;Salem's Lot&#34; movies and mini-series. Many have said one follows the author's writings much better than the other. Unfortunately, that doesn't always mean we get a better movie just because it's more faithful. That's the case with Director Kimberly Peirce's vision of &#34;Carrie.&#34;Carrie's (Chloe Grace Moretz) life can only be described as miserable and lonely. An outcast in school, she finds no solace at home. Her overbearing mother (Julianne Moore) is a misled and overzealous religious nut that constantly condemns Carrie and everyone around her for the sins they have and will commit. When the young girl finds she possesses telekinetic powers, it opens up a whole new world to her. It won't be long before both her psychotic mother and bullying classmates will regret everything they've ever said and done to Carrie.Several things are wrong with &#34;Carrie.&#34; First off, it's very hard to buy Chloe Grace Moretz as a &#34;Plain Jane&#34; girl who is the blight of the school and the outcast everyone picks on. She's too cute to be playing this kind of character. That's not to say she didn't do her best in the role. I just think she was miscast.Secondly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a made-for-TV movie through much of &#34;Carrie.&#34; The camerawork and overall look reminded me of something I'd see on Lifetime. It's passible, but doesn't give the movie the cinematic feel it should have.2013's &#34;Carrie&#34; does take viewers in a couple different directions that weren't explored in Brian De Palma's version of the story. However, that doesn't necessarily translate into being a good thing. Moretz's portrayal of Carrie doesn't leave the audience with the sense of empathy Sissy Spacek's did in the first adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller.The title character's telekinetic powers are much more fantastical in the new &#34;Carrie.&#34; Instead of just being able to move things with her mind, she can also stop cars in their tracks, fly, and cause the ground to split open. Whether more accurate to the book or not, these powers feel like a bit much and don't hold up well on film.Finally, some of the special effects and CGI were less than spectacular. My biggest complaint is that the explosions suffered from looking a bit too artificial. More time in the image editing process could have cleaned these issues up.The real diamond in the rough when it comes to &#34;Carrie&#34; is Julianne Moore. Her portrayal of Margaret White is absolutely wonderful and disturbing. She perfectly captures the desperation and lunacy the character bounces through with complete sincerity.&#34;Carrie&#34; is rated R for bloody violence, disturbing images, language, and some sexual content. It's definitely gory enough for a restricted rating. There's one scene where two teens are having sex that was unnecessary. They didn't show any nudity, but it was still too much. If it weren't for that scene, this could easily have been rated PG-13.I really respected the way Bible-based Christianity isn't thrown under the bus in 2013's &#34;Carrie.&#34; As the mother is spouting off religious banter, Carrie points out that what the mother is reciting isn't even found in the Bible. This gives viewers a clearer picture that Margaret isn't practicing traditional living through scripture. Her beliefs are more cult-like and not limited to true Biblical teachings.The DVD edition of &#34;Carrie&#34; contains a few special features. They include a making-of featurette entitled &#34;Bringing Back Carrie.&#34; A featurette entitled &#34;Telekinetic Coffee Shop Surprise&#34; and a theatrical trailer are found as well.2013's &#34;Carrie&#34; isn't going to please people who loved Brian De Palma's version. It might be more accurate to Stephen King's written word, but it lacks the tension and emotion of the 1976 film. However, it will appeal to those who never saw the first screen adaptation of the book and teenagers will find it easy to relate to. It's safe to say they'll definitely think twice before bullying someone in the future after watching this.",3,"""Carrie"" Remake Might Satisfy a New Crowd, but Still Falls Short of De Palma's

1604909,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B00A2H9WW8,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[1, 3]","With that said, I was surprised by this remake of the classic DePalma film, based off Stephan King's novel. The performances are up to standard, with the exception of [insert name here] who plays Sue. As pretty as she is, she gives a wooden performance. Not awful but lacking in comparison to her other co-stars.When reviewing a remake, one is compelled to compare it to the original. Unfortunately for ""Carrie"" (2013), it is trying to re-do a classic chiller that is re-known for its iconic performances by 2 of its female leads, Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Chloe Grace Moretz is a great Carrie. Although she looks nothing like the character as written by King (Spacek also didn't BTW) and despite being too cute, too pretty, she is very believable as the awkward teen who is constantly bullied by her cruel classmates. Once overcome by vengeance during the prom scene, she is impressive. In contrast to Spacek who simply stared, Moretz gets very physical when unleashing her fury, using her hands and body and it is effective visually. I do have to add that during the prom scene, Moretz resembled a blood-soaked Britney Spears... just sayin'. Julianne Moore, as expected, is good as Carrie's mother but she does lack Piper Laurie's sinister appeal and many to date remember Laurie for her chilling, over-the-top performance in the DePalma film. I do not think Moore's performance, as good as she was, will have that kind of everlasting impact.The remake is very faithful to the original film. The content has been updated (how can anyone make a film about teenagers and not include a smart-phone?) and the special effects are clearly better. However where the film-makers lost it was in the execution. Despite glossier production values, they managed to eliminate the fright factor. This Carrie is polished but not scary. There is far more destruction on screen yet it remains underwhelming. One of the biggest let-downs for me was the prom scene. The original used various techniques to enthral the audience - the awesome split screen, minimal music, drastic lighting and those haunting Spacek eyes. That classic image with the fire rising from behind a blood soaked Carrie as she stiffly walks off the stage remains a potent image in horror. The remake offers nothing of that magnitude. There is destruction and a lot of it but the prom scene, which is supposed to be a highlight, pales in comparison and remains a missed opportunity. But one of the film's biggest disappointment was the final closing scene. It is lame. The original film closed off with a dream sequence with Amy Irving, dressed in white, walking to Carrie's burial ground. It was a haunting addition to the film and closed it off brilliantly. What they did in the remake was just plain lazy. I did not expect the film-makers to imitate the original but come on, at least attempt to close the film off with a bang.Overall, this is a pretty good sequel but it could have and should have been great.

1604910,A380H0RPMMOG3E,B00A2H9WW8,"E. Von Ray ""adventurer""","[0, 0]","There is no denying Chloe Grace Moretz  is a great young actress. What's wrong with this film is not with her at all. It's almost everything except her where this film goes wrong. The supporting cast, save Judy Greer, is very average. Being 'average' can work for a Lifetime movie but not on the big screen. I was shocked at how low budget it seemed. And the choices made were very odd.For example, the 'birth' scene at the beginning was unnecessary. The 'period' scene was way overdone in every way. And every single time kids are shown making fun of Carrie. It was overkill. Were ALL the kids that bad? It was ridiculous at some point.Then we come to Julianne Moore, who plays Carrie's mother. She is a fine actress but I never felt she was very good. It was overacting. Perhaps that is what they were shooting for but we need to be able to identify with these characters and I have been around religious people my whole life and not once have I met someone like her. She was clearly insane.But, as disappointed as I was with most of the film, eventually Chloe Grace Moretz rises above it and delivers some very memorable scenes. She is a powerful actress I hope does not fall into trouble like so many young actors do.Here was a chance at a film that could have followed the novel more faithfully. Well, it didn't. Instead, it tried to follow the DePalma film and though I am not a fan of that film, it is certainly better than this one. The constraints of that period are gone. We can do almost any special effect. And what made the novel so incredibly moving was what happened to Carrie and the connection she made with Sue. Maybe that is unfilmable but it would have been a bold choice.Worth a rental.",3,Worth it for Chloe Grace Moretz,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1707,"['denying', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'great', 'young', 'actress', 'What', 'wrong', 'film', 'not', 'almost', 'everything', 'where', 'film', 'wrong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'save', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'very', 'average', 'Being', ""'average"", 'can', 'work', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'not', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'low', 'budget', 'seemed', 'choices', 'made', 'were', 'very', 'odd.For', 'example', ""'birth"", 'scene', 'beginning', 'was', 'unnecessary', ""'period"", 'scene', 'was', 'way', 'overdone', 'way', 'single', 'time', 'kids', 'are', 'shown', 'making', 'fun', 'Carrie', 'was', 'overkill', 'Were', 'kids', 'bad', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'point.Then', 'come', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'who', 'Carrie', 'mother', 'fine', 'actress', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'overacting', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'were', 'shooting', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'around', 'religious', 'people', 'whole', 'life', 'not', 'once', 'have', 'met', 'someone', 'was', 'clearly', 'insane.But', 'as', 'disappointed', 'was', 'most', 'film', 'eventually', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'powerful', 'actress', 'hope', 'not', 'fall', 'trouble', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'actors', 'do.Here', 'was', 'chance', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'followed', 'novel', 'more', 'faithfully', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'tried', 'follow', 'DePalma', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'film', 'certainly', 'better', 'one', 'constraints', 'period', 'are', 'gone', 'can', 'do', 'almost', 'special', 'effect', 'what', 'made', 'novel', 'so', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'was', 'what', 'happened', 'Carrie', 'connection', 'made', 'Sue', 'Maybe', 'unfilmable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bold', 'choice.Worth', 'rental']",Carrie

1604913,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00A2H9WW8,FNDNreview,"[3, 5]","In November 1976, the Stephen King adapted horror flick, Carrie - starring Sissy Spacek, took the box office by storm.  If you look at the box office returns for the film today, they are by no means impressive as the film only earned $33.8 million.  However, don't forget that was back in 1976, and still plenty enough to thrust Carrie towards the top of the list of the highest grossing films of the year.  Not only was Carrie a commercial success, it was also highly praised by fans and critics, and even today is regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made.  You know what that means, right?  It means it was only a matter of time before the studio decided it was time for a remake.  Obviously, remakes are a natural occurrence these days and rarely live up to the originals - especially in the horror genre.  But, Carrie might just be the exception to the rule.Directed by Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don't Cry, Stop-Loss), Carrie stars Chlo Grace Moretz as Carrie White, a gifted teenage outcast that discovers she has the ability to move objects with her mind.  After an embarrassing incident in the girl's shower room, fellow classmate, Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) attempts to make amends by convincing her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort), to take Carrie to the prom.  However, another fellow classmate, Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) is suspended from prom over the shower incident, prompting her to seek revenge against Carrie - in front of everyone at the dance.  Against the wishes of her highly religious mother, Margaret (Julianne Moore), Carrie decides to attend the dance, leading to the most life changing moment in Carrie's life.  Judy Greer, Alex Russell, and Barry Shabaka Henley also star in supporting roles.To simply say this film is bad because it's nothing more than a repeat of the original is just flat out stupid.  In fact, it's fair to say that this Carrie remake is executed smoother than the original.  Unlike the poor re-imagining of horror classics, like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, Carrie sticks to the same storyline as the original - with slight variations and welcome additions.  If anything, the modifications and additions by screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen make this story even stronger than the original.  For instance, viewers never knew the definite fate of Tommy Ross in the original, so that question is answered for us.  For reasons beyond comprehension, Tommy and Carrie kiss on multiple occasions in the original, even though he's supposedly dating Sue, which is addressed and cleaned-up in the new version.  And finally, a slight elaboration about Carrie's powers is briefly mentioned when she states there are more people in the world like her - a small fact that will no doubt lead to possible sequels.While I'm personally a fan of Chlo Grace Moretz's acting, largely for her strong portrayal of Hit-Girl in the Kick-Ass films, she's not exactly the best choice for Carrie White.  Sissy Spacek had a much more mysterious, often creepy vibe surrounding her character.  Moretz doesn't feel like an outcast in this film - quite the opposite in fact, to the extent that she could easily be a member of the ""in"" crowd if she would simply loosen up and talk more.  Spacek's version felt like an outcast, clearly struggling to maintain control of the inner hatred that was just looking for an excuse to be unleashed.  Moretz's version just doesn't provide that same inner turmoil.  Even though Moretz is more age appropriate for the role (16 years old), she doesn't seem angry enough.  If anything, she appears to be too happy for her own good.  Even the climactic showdown at the dance feels more like an overreaction than a full-blown emotional meltdown.  In any event, I guess we should all be happy Moretz was cast instead of the previously rumored Lindsay Lohan.  That surely would have been an onscreen and off-screen disaster of Carrie-like proportions.The supporting cast is mainly lackluster and hardly worth mentioning, but as usual, Julianne Moore stands out (as always) - in the role of Carrie's mother, Margaret White.  In all honesty, has Moore even given a bad performance in her life?  Regardless, she really (forgive the baseball metaphor) knocks this character out of the park.  She's doesn't necessarily appear to be as overly religious as Piper Laurie's portrayal - at least in terms of preaching, but is much more harmful to herself in the name of God.  On several occasions, Moore appears to be on the verge of insanity, especially in one scene where she is beating her head against the wall and also in another scene where she is purposely stabbing herself in the leg.  In a perfect world, Moore's depiction of the character would star alongside Sissy Spacek's portrayal of Carrie.  Now that would actually be the pairing from supernatural Hell.Overall, Carrie is an enjoyable remake that will bring this masterful story to a new generation.  Obviously, this film is targeted towards a younger film audience, with an emphasis on horror.  Although, horror fans are sure to be disappointed with this effort, since it doesn't provide for one outstanding scare and will likely seem boring in comparison to modern horror flicks, like The Conjuring and Insidious.  At times, this story feels sadly outdated, which is what made the original film popular in the first place.  Sure, this new film cleans up a bunch of small nuances that felt out of place in the 1976 version.  On the other hand, there's no such thing as a perfect film and the die-hard lovers of the original won't like the fact that some things are changed (although many lines are still the same) - even if they do make more sense.  For me, this reworked story is much cleaner and more elaborate, making for a better film experience, especially if you've never seen the original.  Still, it's impossible to give a remake a score that's any higher than average.  After all, it's really nothing more than a blatant copy.GRADE: CFNDNreview.com",3,"'Carrie' a surprisingly strong, honorable remake",1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,6010,"['November', '1976', 'Stephen',

1604916,A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K,B00A2H9WW8,Fred,"[2, 3]","I had high hopes for this newest remake... it simply fails. They didn't change much but what they did change are the subtle edginess of nearly every moment that pushed the original forward in alienating the main character Carrie. The political correctness of modern society, or the medias modern PC agenda has cleaned up every aspect of this film... the characters are all so thoughtful and hesitate to be realistic only to go that extra touchy feely step to soften up reality for our poor little Carrie.I always thought they should have cast Dakota Fanning in this anyway, but Moretz? does an ok job... but I feel that Fanning would have pulled it off with much more sensitivity and neurotic flair.

Case in point Sam Peckinpah's classic Straw Dogs starring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George. Other examples being Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, classics in the genre.Occasionally though a worthwhile remake comes along such as I Spit on Your Grave or Last House on the Left which while the originals may not be classics they have gained a certain reputation, and a good way to explore the originals. I particularly liked the remake of John Carpenter's The Thing which can be seen as a precursor to the Alien movies, and I loved that they made the protagonist female.Among the hardest acts to follow would be the remake of De Palma's original version of Carrie based on the Stephen King classic book which had a stellar cast including Sissy Spacek and John Travolta in a minor role. It has been a long time since I saw the original, and as I watched this remake starring Chloe Grace Moretz, at first I did start comparing it to the original but as I continued to watch I began to realize what a brilliant story this is, and how relevant it is as a metaphor for high school life today. The original has a surprise element which I have now seen many times with slight variations in other movies, an indicator of its huge influence..Since the original movie in 1976 we have had many high school shootings. In some cases the perpetrators are marginalized or outsiders, treated as weird or even bullied by other kids with tragic consequences. So in some respects while Carrie is a tale of a girl with supernatural abilities, with a religious zealot for a mother, in this case played very ably by Julianne Moore, kept ignorant of the facts of life, and who is exploited and bullied by the other girls, and if you care to look at it on a deeper level it is a story of the reality of fitting and even surviving.The story elements mesh together beautifully. We have the entitled bad girl cheerleader, the crazy mother, the girl with a conscience who regrets her participation, the supportive gym teacher, and the unfortunate girl who wants a shot at a normal life. Even though Carrie does bad things we get the sense that if things had gone only slightly differently she might have achieved that goal. If the prom were to go off without incident who knows what would be possible, but high school and the darker side of human nature can throw some serious curve balls.I have to admit I was quite taken with this remake, and I loved the recurring symbolism of blood and roses of different colors throughout the movie. Does it hold a candle to the original? I think so, and it's updated to today's age to allow for social media expanding the level of humiliation possible to foist on a young girl.Carrie did quite well at the Box Office opening to a $16 million weekend and achieving a highly respectable $35 million domestically and more than $82 million worldwide so far, from a $30 million production budget, with dvd sales yet to come.I think most people will love it and I hope this was helpful.",5,Want to go to the prom?,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,3116,"['so', 'often', 'get', 'remake', 'horror', 'classic', 'most', 'times', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'original', 'Case', 'point', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'classic', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'starring', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'George', 'Other', 'examples', 'being', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'classics', 'genre.Occasionally', 'worthwhile', 'remake', 'along', 'such', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'originals', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'classics', 'have', 'gained', 'certain', 'reputation', 'good', 'way', 'explore', 'originals', 'particularly', 'liked', 'remake', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Thing', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'precursor', 'Alien', 'movies', 'loved', 'made', 'protagonist', 'hardest', 'acts', 'follow', 'would', 'be', 'remake', 'De', 'Palma', 'original', 'version', 'Carrie', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'classic', 'book', 'had', 'stellar', 'cast', 'including', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'John', 'Travolta', 'minor', 'role', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'saw', 'original', 'watched', 'remake', 'starring', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'first', 'did', 'start', 'comparing', 'original', 'continued', 'watch', 'began', 'realize', 'what', 'brilliant', 'story', 'how', 'relevant', 'metaphor', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'today', 'original', 'surprise', 'element', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'slight', 'variations', 'other', 'movies', 'indicator', 'huge', 'influence..Since', 'original', 'movie', '1976', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'high', 'school', 'shootings', 'cases', 'perpetrators', 'are', 'marginalized', 'outsiders', 'treated', 'weird', 'even', 'bullied', 'other', 'kids', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'So', 'respects', 'Carrie', 'tale', 'girl', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'religious', 'zealot', 'mother', 'case', 'played', 'very', 'ably', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'kept', 'ignorant', 'facts', 'life', 'who', 'exploited', 'bullied', 'other', 'girls', 'care', 'look', 'deeper', 'level', 'story', 'reality', 'fitting', 'even', 'surviving.The', 'story', 'elements', 'mesh', 'together', 'beautifully', 'have', 'entitled', 'bad', 'girl', 'cheerleader', 'crazy', 'mother', 'girl', 'conscience', 'who', 'participation', 'supportive', 'gym', 'teacher', 'unfortunate', 'girl', 'who', 'shot', 'normal', 'life', 'Even', 'Carrie', 'bad', 'things', 'get', 'sense', 'things', 'had', 'gone', 'only', 'slightly', 'differently', 'might', 'have', 'achieved', 'goal', 'prom', 'were', 'go', 'off', 'incident', 'who', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'high', 'school', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'can', 'throw', 'serious', 'curve', 'balls.I', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'quite', 'taken', 'remake', 'loved', 'recurring', 'symbolism', 'blood', 'roses', 'different', 'colors', 'movie', 'hold', 'candle', 'original', 'think', 'so', 'updated', 'today', 'age', 'allow', 'social', 'media', 'expanding', 'level', 'humiliation', 'possible', 'foist', 'young', 'girl.Carrie', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'Box', 'Office', 'opening', '16', 'million', 'weekend', 'achieving', 'highly', 'respectable', '35', 'million', 'domestically', 'more', '82', 'million', 'worldwide', 'so', 'far', '30', 'million', 'production', 'budget', 'dvd', 'sales', 'yet', 'come.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Carrie

There were also scenes which weren't really needed. It was best left to a minimum until the end to create that powerful shock of suspense and horror, that's why it was so shocking in the original.Moore was quite terrible as a crazy woman, but the original mother [piper laurie] had that crazy wild over religious personality and that nut job look on her face that made for a superb performance. Moore i'm sure is a good actress but she couldn't really pull off the ""crazy over religious woman"" vibe NOT as piper did. As for ""chole moretz"" she didn't have the same dedication to her role as sissy did, meaning you don't get that social outcast vibe.

There is fluid and blood. In the bedroom, Margaret White (Julianne Moore) is laying on the bed yelling to God. There is blood all over her sheets around her. She continues to scream and then she looks between her legs. She sees a baby. She gets a pair of scissors to stab at the baby girl, but then she changes her mind and picks up her baby to hold it close to her.It is now 17 years later, the girl, Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) is now at high school at the swimming poll. She is very modest and covers her body with a towel. She is uncomfortable around others, especially those young teenagers kissing. In water volleyball, Carrie is shy with the other girls and not athletic. The P.E. Coach, Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer), tries to get Carrie included in the game. The girls are outgoing and assertive. Carrie is more reserved.Later, in the shower as Carrie begins to use the soap to wash herself, she sees blood. Not knowing why there is blood, she becomes upset and yells for help. She goes to the others girls in the locker room still yelling for help. They are not kind to her. Chris (Portia Doubleday) takes a video with her iPhone of Carrie in her bloody embarrassment. Ms. Desjardin comes in and tries to help Carrie.Carrie didn't know what a period was. It was her first ""woman's time""Carrie also discovers she has extraordinary powers. She can make things happen to items and other people.At home, she asks her very religious mother, Margaret, why she didn't tell her about periods. Her mother criticizes her and says it is a curse to bleed and have sinful thoughts.

1604934,A2O5CK8J5RP32Z,B00A2H9WW8,"JCP ""MommaJ""","[1, 1]","Though for classic horror fans Carrie(1976) still holds up, this is a well done reboot of the Stephen King novel and Brian De Palma film. Having read the book (though more than 25 years ago now, in about the 9th grade) and having seen the original movie (a few times, most recently last year) I was interested to see what they would do differently. I didn't begin watching Carrie with particularly high or low expectations. This ambivalence leant objectivity to my viewing.The performances, while quite good were not as impressive as they should have been with such juicy parts and talented actresses. I don't know why they didn't perform as well as I believe they could have (director? script issues? fx issues? or the actresses just couldn't connect with their characters?). Most likely there is more than one reason, but whatever the reasons both the experienced Julianne Moore and the relatively novice Chloe Grace Moretz gave somewhat uneven performances. If they were better than very good I would have rounded up to 4 stars rather than down from 3.5 for the 5 star scale with only whole stars available. As it is we rely on the solid story (Carrie is one of King's better novels) and modern special effects.Where the story is concerned there were two significant differences from the earlier version and more importantly the novel that are worth mentioning. SPOILER ALERT! The movie begins with Carrie's birth. Perhaps someone who has read the book within the last 25 years can confirm or correct me, but I do not believe King wrote any such scene. I found it unnecessary and capricious. Alternately the other change was a modernization in the storyline that was necessary since without the inclusion of mobile phones and social networks any story about modern high school students would itself be capricious. So the addition of Carrie being filmed in the locker room scene and its subsequent upload to a Facebook-like website was a natural update to make. In fact I can only assume that their fictitious school has strict rules against phones in the locker rooms or there would have been more recordings and uploads than the one by the slithery Chris Hargensen. Btw Portia Doubleday as Chris Hargensen actually gives the most consistently good performance in Carrie.As to Carrie's discovery and mastery of her powers I would say there is both benefit and damage in how they were depicted. She seemed to enjoy the powers without as much hesitation as was in the novel. It's inconsistent to have a girl excited to be so exceptional in one breath while pleading with her mother to be allowed to be normal and just like everyone else in the next. This is not to suggest that she should be completely ashamed of or horrified by her powers, but certainly she would be ambivalent at least. I did find it natural for her to experiment with them as she did, but I would not be at all surprised to read the term, &#34;over-the-top&#34; in a review or two when discussing her powers after things turn for the worse at the prom. She quite quickly went from attempting to control lifting books and her bed in the air to crashing a car into air. This is the fun of the film though, isn't it? Carrie going haywire is, after all what we all rent or buy the movie to watch. In this sense, the filmmakers did quite well. Carrie does go haywire, and when she does, she has suddenly and supremely mastered her telekinetic powers. Kimberly Pierce extends these scenes more than De Palma did. Certainly she was thinking of her audience. In our current horror genre renaissance directors are surely pressured to make the most of the climax in a movie where the terror is not throughout the film, but builds to it.All in all I recommend the film to fans of the genre. I'll temper the recommendation by sharing that I am glad I decided to rent Carrie rather than buy it. It is an uneven attempt to bring King's opus to life, but done with gusto. Carrie is horrifically entertaining.

1604935,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B00A2H9WW8,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[8, 14]","I vehemently hate remakes of great movie classics.The exceptions have been John Carpenter's approach to THE THING, another was INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and two others: THE RING and THE BLOB.The original 1976 CARRIE became a landmark in movie making. We had phenomenal performers--Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie (both nominated for Academy Awards), a knockout supporting cast, fantastic direction from Brian DePalma, a powerful music score,screenplay, editing, etc.In this version I saw this afternoon, the whole movie looks like it was filmed through an unwashed window. The colors were flat, almost pastel. Chole Grace Moretz portrayed the misfit Carrie White as a beautiful young girl who wears her hair matted over her left eye. In no way, does she look like a pitiful, abused girl, only one who just needs to brush her hair and raise her face.Julianne Moore as Margaret White, the mother, is ugly, skeletal, who mumbles so low it was impossible to understand her most of the time. Piper Laurie portrayed her as a voluptuous woman with a magnificent mane of red hair that resembled a halo.We never see much of Carrie's newly discovered powers. She makes things rise up and down, doors slam, and at the end, she does suddenly unleash her fury. But she has no interesting enemies to payback for their bullying.I missed the powerful music score of the original, and looked for something different.This rendering was so bloodless and anemic, it could play on the Disney Channel with little editing.And yes, this version copies the original scenes down to that final ending where &#34;Sue&#34; dreams of taking flowers to Carrie's grave.This grade-Z remake reminds me again of the total drought of fresh ideas in Hollywood.For the $30 million it took to make this bomb, the money could have been invested in a brand new horror classic--the kind we saw when brilliant minds gave us such classics as PSYCHO, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, ALIEN, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD, HALLOWEEN and of course CARRIE.Surely, these filmmakers are out there, dying for a chance to give movie-goers something fresh, new, original.

1604942,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00A2H9WW8,John's Horror Corner,"[7, 12]","Let's just start by fending off the critics who just troll for things to criticize.  This is a remake of the 1976 film based on Stephen King's first novel.  Because the original was powerful an remains effective to this day, some may argue that this is a remake that has no business being made.  I thought that about the 2011 remake (which they claimed was a prequel) The Thing (2011).  However, unlike The Thing, Carrie was remade impressively, honors the original and brings all of the quality to a present day audience that may have never given the time of day to the 36 year old original.Carrie White (Chlo Grace Moretz; Dark Shadows, Let Me In, The Eye, The Amityville Horror) is an awkward, sheltered, God-fearing 18-year old living with her fanatical zealot of a mother (Julianne Moore; Seventh Son, 6 Souls).  She develops telekinetic powers after being humiliated at school as she comes of age (physiologically).  As a result of her humiliating trauma, she becomes the subject of attention of some clique-y, over-entitled &#34;it&#34; girls leading to a cruel prank that gets way out of hand when after Carrie is asked to prom by a popular boy, they are crowned king and queen of the prom, and Carrie has the time of her life.The changes from the original were few in this remake.  But the major accomplishment here was modernizing a classic while preserving legendary acting performances with current actors.  Everyone seemed to do a solid job.  Carrie's classmates were vicious, with a cruelty credibly fueled by entitlement.  Chlo Grace Moretz was impressive, instantly capturing my greatest sympathies.  And Julianne Moore made me shutter almost every time I saw her face; hauntingly insane, often psychotic.  Moore commands most of our nervous attention until the prom scene, when Chlo Grace Moretz shifts gears from great to amazing!At this point I'd like to pause and address a non-horror victory.  The prom scene was enchanting.  They did such a great job making Carrie's date seem sweet and attentive.  For about ten minutes we see Carrie coming of age mentally as a beautiful, somewhat confident woman.  She makes friends, has her first dance, enjoys her first embrace from a boy, and feels safe and cared for perhaps for the first time in her life.  I almost wanted the movie to have a happy ending.  No, they really did that good of a job making this scene, well&#8230;just so&#8230;touching!  It reminded me of my prom and simultaneously made me think &#34;if I should ever have a daughter I hope she has a prom experience like this.&#34;Well, not entirely like this. This effectively sweet and tender scene primes us for what we all know happens next.  The messy prom finale.  It's impressive.  Carrie exacts her rage on her classmates to gory ends, sparing the few she knows to be innocent but indiscriminately rending all others.  Her face mixes horror, revenge and, at moments, a karmically reciprocal satisfaction.  The scale is large, the revenge is sweet, and the ending is appropriately sad.  Although, the final few minutes felt forced.If I had a criticism it would be that Carrie's telekinesis comes out of nowhere.  It may have justifiably emerged after a traumatic event, but how did this not happen before in her four years of high school or a lifetime with her incredibly psychologically abusive mother?  She also seems to master the power to levels of shocking acuity, which diminishes the frightening rage-like abandon with which she wields her powers in the prom scene.  It seems equal parts meltdown and calculated, instead of entirely meltdown.But largely this film was AMAZING.  This remake is not only worthy, but a must-see which should stoke young horror fans' interest in the original.",5,Today's Carrie preserves the legendary performances of the original with contemporary actors and an updated setting.,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,3731,"['Let', 'just', 'start', 'fending', 'off', 'critics', 'who', 'just', 'troll', 'things', 'criticize', 'remake', '1976', 'film', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first', 'novel', 'original', 'was', 'powerful', 'effective', 'day', 'may', 'argue', 'remake', 'business', 'being', 'made', 'thought', '2011', 'remake', 'claimed', 'was', 'prequel', 'Thing', '2011', 'However', 'Thing', 'Carrie', 'was', 'remade', 'impressively', 'honors', 'original', 'quality', 'present', 'day', 'audience', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'given', 'time', 'day', '36', 'year', 'old', 'White', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Let', 'Me', 'Eye', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'awkward', 'sheltered', 'God-fearing', '18-year', 'old', 'living', 'fanatical', 'zealot', 'mother', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Seventh', 'Son', '6', 'Souls', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'being', 'humiliated', 'school', 'age', 'physiologically', 'result', 'humiliating', 'trauma', 'subject', 'attention', 'clique-y', 'over-entitled', '34', '34', 'girls', 'leading', 'cruel', 'prank', 'way', 'hand', 'when', 'Carrie', 'asked', 'prom', 'popular', 'boy', 'are', 'crowned', 'king', 'queen', 'prom', 'Carrie', 'time', 'life.The', 'changes', 'original', 'were', 'few', 'remake', 'major', 'accomplishment', 'here', 'was', 'modernizing', 'classic', 'preserving', 'legendary', 'acting', 'performances', 'current', 'actors', 'Everyone', 'seemed', 'do', 'solid', 'job', 'Carrie', 'classmates', 'were', 'vicious', 'cruelty', 'credibly', 'fueled', 'entitlement', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'was', 'impressive', 'instantly', 'capturing', 'greatest', 'sympathies', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'made', 'shutter', 'almost', 'time', 'saw', 'face', 'hauntingly', 'insane', 'often', 'psychotic', 'Moore', 'most', 'nervous', 'attention', 'prom', 'scene', 'when', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'shifts', 'gears', 'great', 'amazing', 'point', ""'d"", 'like', 'pause', 'address', 'non-horror', 'victory', 'prom', 'scene', 'was', 'enchanting', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'Carrie', 'date', 'seem', 'sweet', 'attentive', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'see', 'Carrie', 'coming', 'age', 'mentally', 'beautiful', 'somewhat', 'confident', 'woman', 'friends', 'first', 'dance', 'first', 'embrace', 'boy', 'feels', 'safe', 'cared', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'almost', 'wanted', 'movie', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'No', 'really', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'scene', 'well', '8230', 'just', 'so', '8230', 'touching', 'reminded', 'prom', 'simultaneously', 'made', 'think', '34', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'daughter', 'hope', 'prom', 'experience', 'this.', '34', 'Well', 'not', 'entirely', 'effectively', 'sweet', 'tender', 'scene', 'primes', 'what', 'know', 'next', 'messy', 'finale', 'impressive', 'Carrie', 'rage', 'classmates', 'gory', 'ends', 'sparing', 'few', 'be', 'innocent', 'indiscriminately', 'rending', 'others', 'face', 'mixes', 'horror', 'revenge', 'moments', 'karmically', 'reciprocal', 'satisfaction', 'scale', 'large', 'revenge', 'sweet', 'ending', 'appropriately', 'sad', 'final', 'few', 'minutes', 'felt', 'forced.If', 'had', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'Carrie', 'telekinesis', 'nowhere', 'may', 'have', 'justifiably', 'emerged', 'traumatic', 'event', 'how', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'four', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'lifetime', 'incredibly', 'psychologically', 'abusive', 'mother', 'also', 'master', 'power', 'levels', 'shocking', 'acuity', 'frightening', 'rage-like', 'abandon', 'powers', 'prom', 'scene', 'equal', 'parts', 'meltdown', 'calculated', 'instead', 'entirely', 'meltdown.But', 'largely', 'film', 'was', 'AMAZING', 'remake', 'not', 'only', 'worthy', 'must-see', 'should', 'stoke', 'young', 'horror', 'fans', 'interest', 'original']",Carrie

Just some thoughts on this second remake of Brian DePalma's 1976 classic...Carrie (2013) is another remake of the Stephen King classic, this time starring Chloe Moretz as Carrie White.  The original movie from 1976 (starring Sissy Spacek as Carrie White) is excellent, one of my favorite horror movies of all time.  The 2002 TV remake (starring Angela Bettis as Carrie White) was fair at best.  This 2013 remake is the better of the two remakes, but not by much (I gave the 2002 movie 3 stars and the 1976 original 5 stars).  I had a hard time buying Chloe Moretz in the role of Carrie White, though she does a decent job and has some moments of brilliance.  She's too attractive looking for the role.  In contrast, Sissy Spacek was perfectly cast in the original and Angela Bettis was a good casting choice in the 2002 movie.  Julianne Moore does a good job as Carrie's mother, but I prefer Piper Laurie from the original.  This 2013 movie is even more over the top than the 2002 movie with the special effects.  The 1976 movie got it just right.  I highly recommend that movie.Anyway, it's inevitable that people are going to compare and contrast the three versions of this movie, and I'm no exception.

We see the good: they stuck to the original story most of the way, the actors were fanomaly great, especually for most of the cast being teenagers, and there is h*** to raise from this girls anger (not going to say it for purposes better left not to get into). There is also the bad from this film: unlike Psycho's 1998 remake, it was not an exact stick-to-the-original-script remake, so there are changes and not EVERYONE suffers, only the bad apples of the bunch. Wheres the fun in that? So it seems more like a tale of revenge than fear. Finally, we have the ugly: as said before, it did not stick entirly to the story, so changes were made, some good and some bad, like for good changes, Carries &#34;cries for help&#34; are put online, so we feel like the film IS up to date, but for bad changes, she is more agressive using her powers, where as the Carrie we know was more scared and a bit shy of using them (until she has her meltdown), plus, when your watching the film, you dont mind watching the who thing progress, but you will always keep telling yourself &#34;LETS SEE HER GET MAD ALREADY!&#34;We can compare the film and remakes to that of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (since they were made in the same years as each other: '76,'02, and '13), The original Carrie was best of the trio, like TCM, the first remake was not too shabby, but not better, but unlike 2013's TCM, 2013 Carrie was held together quite nicely, Where as the 2013 Texas Chainsaw Massacure was an absolute fail (to people who have seen the others).So there you have it folks.

With a supporting cast that includes Judy Greer, Julianne Moore, and many others, here is my review on Carrie.The film starts out very strange; almost to the point of you wanting to look away from the screen. Nonetheless we are soon introduced to Carrie (Chloe Moretz): shy, quiet, and an outcast. She is often teased, and when she is not being teased she is being kept up by her overly religious mom. And soon enough, Carrie comes to slowly understand why she is not like everyone else. You see the things that happen in this movie. And you want the conflict resolved. And for the most part, the conflict in the story is resolved exactly how you would expect it to be.The acting in this movie is top notch. Chloe Moretz embodies the character of Carrie extremely well. Julianne Moore had a very realistic approach playing Carrie's mom. Supporting cast was good too.All in all, while Carrie is once again a movie I would not consider to be scary or terryfing, it is a film that is quite enjoyable and exciting to watch. You are in for quite a surprise.

She played the innocent, scared girl SO well.  I actually almost cried at a few parts because I felt so bad for her.  She was amazing.  The lady who plays the mom also did a great job of playing the strict, scared mom.  The entire cast was very believable.  I have to applaud them all.Something else that was cool were the effects.  The scene with the blood on her, it just starts floating in the air.  Very cool.  Many things happen and the effects look great throughout.I like simple movies.  While this was not simple as far as how or why she could do what she did or what was going on in her mind, it was simple in the fact that everything really took place at her house or at the school.  That is easy to understand.  Those were the two places she was hurt the most.  You get to see her realize that she has to make her own decisions.  Only to have everything end in a bang.  Unless that is, it has not.",4,A really cool movie.,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,2332,"['Now', 'days', 'people', 'seem', 'use', 'weapons', 'way', 'express', 'pain', 'Be', 'gun', 'knife', 'bomb', 'else', 'people', 'can', 'find', 'hard', 'know', 'when', 'someone', 'verge', 'loosing', 'control', 'Now', 'imagine', 'are', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Going', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'teenage', 'girls', 'go', 'Now', 'imagine', ""'ve"", 'held', 'rage', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'mentally', 'abused', 'mother', 'kids', 'school', 'find', 'can', 'control', 'things', 'mind', 'mind', 'weapon', 'Anything', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'kill', 'who', 'have', 'hurt', 'Even', 'own', 'bodies', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Would', 'make', 'pay', 'what', 'did', 'would', 'just', 'let', 'continue', 'go', 'be', 'abused', 'Welcome', 'problem', 'Carrie', 'facing', 'religious', 'nut', 'mother', 'preventing', 'living', 'normal', 'life', 'group', 'teen', 'girls', 'school', 'difficult', 'time', 'One', 'day', 'can', 'make', 'things', 'movie', 'just', 'thinking', 'Something', 'so', 'happy', 'Maybe', 'will', 'have', 'normal', 'thing', 'happen', 'Certain', 'people', 'take', 'torment', 'far', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Carrie', 'what', 'learned', 'able', 'make', 'everyone', 'pay', 'Then', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'truly', 'be', 'end.My', 'mom', 'went', 'see', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'First', 'girl', 'who', 'Carrie', 'was', 'amazing', 'played', 'innocent', 'scared', 'girl', 'SO', 'well', 'actually', 'almost', 'cried', 'few', 'parts', 'felt', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'amazing', 'lady', 'who', 'mom', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'strict', 'scared', 'mom', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'have', 'applaud', 'all.Something', 'else', 'was', 'cool', 'were', 'effects', 'scene', 'blood', 'just', 'floating', 'air', 'Very', 'cool', 'Many', 'things', 'happen', 'effects', 'look', 'great', 'throughout.I', 'simple', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'simple', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'why', 'could', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'mind', 'was', 'simple', 'fact', 'everything', 'really', 'took', 'place', 'house', 'school', 'easy', 'understand', 'were', 'two', 'places', 'was', 'hurt', 'most', 'get', 'see', 'realize', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'Only', 'have', 'everything', 'end', 'bang', 'not']",Carrie

1604955,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00A2H9WW8,K. Reynolds,"[1, 4]","THERE&#8217;S SOMETHING about Carrie White, the shy misfit created by Stephen King in his first published novel. This is the fourth film appearance inspired by the character, the first being a memorable 1976 outing starring Sissy Spacek as Carrie.Emotionally and physically abused by her mother, Carrie is the target for bullies at school and in her neighborhood. Her situation reaches crisis level when she begins her first menstruation period in the gym shower. Without any education from her fanatically religious mother, Carrie believes she&#8217;s bleeding to death. Her classmates respond viciously, throwing tampons and pads at the hysterical girl, telling her to &#8220;Stop it up!&#8221;Then things get worse &#8212; for Carrie and everyone around her.Reports of cyber-bullying and resulting teen suicides have been all over the news during the past few years, and director Kimberly Peirce (&#8220;Boys Don&#8217;t Cry,&#8221; 1999; &#8220;Stop-Loss,&#8221; 2008) revises Carrie&#8217;s story to cover this modern horror. It is an outstanding effort, on a par with the Spacek film that made audiences feel compassion and shriek with fright. Seriously, when I first saw the Spacek &#8220;Carrie,&#8221; there were people who screamed at the end scene, jumped from their seats, and ran for the exit. The woman sitting beside me tripped over my feet getting out.The alternate ending available among the extras in Pieirce&#8217;s version won&#8217;t do that. Smart decision to leave it out along with the other deleted scenes included on the Blu-ray. (The DVD only has the movie.) The new ending mirrors the sadness and sense of loss King creates in his book. It&#8217;s not an easy task to pull off, but Peirce does it.That could be because she&#8217;s working from a good, tight script, refusing to be diverted. She&#8217;s also working with a perfect cast. Chol Grace Moretz of &#8220;Kick-Ass&#8221; and the American version of &#8220;Let Me In&#8221; plays Carrie in a flawless performance. (And she was only 15-years-old at filming!) She&#8217;s not as nave as Spacek&#8217;s take, showing how times have changed. This Carrie is Internet savvy, using computers and the library to find out more about her sudden telekinetic powers. When popular girl Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) hatches the plan to have her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, charmingly played by Ansel Elgort, take Carrie to the prom, Carrie knows something is up. Unfortunately, her hopes of fitting in overcome her suspicions.Pierce gives her opinion of the actors, King&#8217;s book &#8211; citing lines and scenes picked directly from the page &#8211; effects and motivations throughout her challenging commentary. What if Sue had simply apologized to Carrie for her role in the gym shower debacle and befriended her instead of setting up this elaborate prom escapade? Could be that, despite her guilt, Carrie is still an outcast and Sue won&#8217;t take a chance on making friends. Pierce speculates the story might have ended much differently, without the blood and fire and death, if Sue had chosen differently.On the other hand, Pierce tells us nearly everything in the film is a metaphor for sex, and has a skewed idea of what a &#8220;horror movie&#8221; fans like: I.E. violence, gore and sex. This is her first horror film; she used John Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;Halloween&#8221; as a template to study. People are always punished after sex in horror movies, she says.Also, Pierces sees &#8220;Carrie&#8221; as a love story between Carrie and her mother, Margaret White played by an intense Julianne Moore. Really? Margaret is as dangerous and crazy as they come; one of the tragedies of &#8220;Carrie&#8221; is how events at the prom drive the girl back to her mother just as the girl shows her first sign of independence. Does crazy, misplaced love still constitute a love story or heighten the horror?Additional extras include a feature on telekinesis; &#8220;Tina on Fire: Stunt Double Dailies,&#8221; with commentary; a brief making-of, &#8220;Creating Carrie&#8221;; and &#8220;Telekinetic Coffee Shop Surprise,&#8221; a Carrie-like prank performed on customers in a caf&eacute;.Disturbing on many levels, this new &#8220;Carrie&#8221; is heart-wrenching, memorable &#8211; and not to be missed.",5,Updated 'Carrie' is a winner,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,4278,"['THERE', '8217', 'S', 'SOMETHING', 'Carrie', 'White', 'shy', 'misfit', 'created', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first', 'published', 'novel', 'fourth', 'film', 'appearance', 'inspired', 'character', 'first', 'being', 'memorable', '1976', 'outing', 'starring', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Carrie.Emotionally', 'physically', 'abused', 'mother', 'Carrie', 'target', 'bullies', 'school', 'neighborhood', 'situation', 'crisis', 'level', 'when', 'first', 'menstruation', 'period', 'gym', 'shower', 'education', 'fanatically', 'religious', 'mother', 'Carrie', '8217', 'bleeding', 'death', 'classmates', 'respond', 'viciously', 'throwing', 'tampons', 'pads', 'hysterical', 'girl', 'telling', '8220', 'Stop', 'up', '8221', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'worse', '8212', 'Carrie', 'everyone', 'her.Reports', 'cyber-bullying', 'resulting', 'teen', 'suicides', 'have', 'been', 'news', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'director', 'Kimberly', 'Peirce', '8220', 'Boys', 'Don', '8217', 'Cry', '8221', '1999', '8220', 'Stop-Loss', '8221', '2008', 'Carrie', '8217', 'story', 'cover', 'modern', 'horror', 'outstanding', 'effort', 'par', 'Spacek', 'film', 'made', 'audiences', 'feel', 'compassion', 'shriek', 'fright', 'Seriously', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Spacek', '8220', 'Carrie', '8221', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'screamed', 'end', 'scene', 'jumped', 'seats', 'ran', 'exit', 'woman', 'sitting', 'tripped', 'feet', 'getting', 'out.The', 'alternate', 'ending', 'available', 'extras', 'Pieirce', '8217', 'version', 'won', '8217', 'do', 'Smart', 'decision', 'leave', 'out', 'other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'only', 'movie', 'new', 'ending', 'mirrors', 'sadness', 'sense', 'loss', 'King', 'book', '8217', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'pull', 'off', 'Peirce', 'it.That', 'could', 'be', '8217', 'working', 'good', 'tight', 'script', 'refusing', 'be', 'diverted', '8217', 's', 'also', 'working', 'perfect', 'cast', 'Chol', 'Grace', 'Moretz', '8220', 'Kick-Ass', '8221', 'American', 'version', '8220', 'Let', 'Me', '8221', 'plays', 'Carrie', 'flawless', 'performance', 'was', 'only', '15-years-old', 'filming', '8217', 'not', 'as', 'nave', 'Spacek', '8217', 's', 'take', 'showing', 'how', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'Carrie', 'Internet', 'savvy', 'using', 'computers', 'library', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'sudden', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'When', 'popular', 'girl', 'Sue', 'Snell', 'Gabriella', 'Wilde', 'plan', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'Tommy', 'Ross', 'charmingly', 'played', 'Ansel', 'Elgort', 'take', 'Carrie', 'prom', 'Carrie', 'something', 'up', 'Unfortunately', 'hopes', 'fitting', 'overcome', 'suspicions.Pierce', 'opinion', 'actors', 'King', '8217', 'book', '8211', 'citing', 'lines', 'scenes', 'picked', 'directly', 'page', '8211', 'effects', 'motivations', 'challenging', 'commentary', 'What', 'Sue', 'had', 'simply', 'apologized', 'Carrie', 'role', 'gym', 'shower', 'debacle', 'befriended', 'instead', 'setting', 'up', 'elaborate', 'prom', 'escapade', 'Could', 'be', 'guilt', 'Carrie', 'still', 'outcast', 'Sue', 'won', '8217', 't', 'take', 'chance', 'making', 'friends', 'Pierce', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'much', 'differently', 'blood', 'fire', 'death', 'Sue', 'had', 'chosen', 'differently.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Pierce', 'nearly', 'everything', 'film', 'metaphor', 'sex', 'skewed', 'idea', 'what', '8220', 'horror', 'movie', '8221', 'fans', 'I.E', 'violence', 'gore', 'sex', 'first', 'horror', 'film', 'used', 'John', 'Carpenter', '8217', '8220', 'Halloween', '8221', 'template', 'study', 'People', 'are', 'always', 'punished', 'sex', 'horror', 'movies', 'says.Also', 'Pierces', '8220', 'Carrie', '8221', 'love', 'story', 'Carrie', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'White', 'played', 'intense', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Really', 'Margaret', 'as', 'dangerous', 'crazy', 'come', 'one', 'tragedies', '8220', 'Carrie', '8221', 'how', 'events', 'prom', 'drive', 'girl', 'back', 'mother', 'just', 'girl', 'first', 'sign', 'independence', 'Does', 'crazy', 'misplaced', 'love', 'still', 'love', 'story', 'heighten', 'horror', 'Additional', 'extras', 'include', 'feature', 'telekinesis', '8220', 'Tina', 'Fire', 'Stunt', 'Double', 'Dailies', '8221', 'commentary', 'brief', 'making-of', '8220', 'Creating', 'Carrie', '8221', '8220', 'Telekinetic', 'Coffee', 'Shop', 'Surprise', '8221', 'Carrie-like', 'prank', 'performed', 'customers', 'caf', 'eacute', '.Disturbing', 'many', 'levels', 'new', '8220', 'Carrie', '8221', 'heart-wrenching', 'memorable', '8211', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Carrie

It is a reimagining of the classic 1974 Stephen King novel of the same name. In my opinion, it is the most appropriate version for modern audiences and the second best of the film adaptations (after the groundbreaking 1976 release which was the first horror film to use a twist ending). The 2013 version of Carrie is focused more on drama than horror. The Blu-ray comes with an alternate cut that has a different ending (101 minutes) and the original theatrical cut (100 minutes). Overall, the picture and audio quality are fantastic. There is 40 minutes of total bonus content plus an audio commentary.

1604971,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B00A2H9WW8,M. Bullions,"[2, 4]","Remakes are tricky. The remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s &#8220;Psycho&#8221; didn&#8217;t really do anything wrong, but was panned universally by audiences and critics, who said that it was exactly the same movie. The same problem followed Kimberly Pierce&#8217;s &#8220;Carrie,&#8221; which is an adaptation of the NOVEL (important to note) written by Stephen King.The thing about this new &#8220;Carrie&#8221; is that it actually adds some layers from the book that were missing from the original film. It&#8217;s not better than the original, but that doesn&#8217;t make it a bad movie either. I don&#8217;t think two better actresses in the year 2013 could have played the lead characters of Carrie White and her mother Margaret quite as well as Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore.In case you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the story, it follows Carrie White (Moretz), a young girl who is mercilessly bullied by her classmates because she&#8217;s &#8216;different&#8217;. Carrie has special telekinetic powers, allowing her to move objects and people if she focuses hard enough. Her mother Margaret is the epitome of bad mothers. She&#8217;s delusional and an overly religious schizophrenic. When the one nice girl in school makes her boyfriend take Carrie to the prom, all hell begins to break loose.Pierce&#8217;s &#8220;Carrie&#8221; is more focused on the small details, character moments that end up making a difference. It can&#8217;t help but feel like the remake that it is, however. The story is essentially the same. Chloe Grace Moretz will grow up to be a very respected actress, if her performance here is any indication. She holds the whole movie, and does it very well. Not an easy thing for a sixteen-year-old girl to do.Feeling perfectly comfortable in her role, Moore will scare the living daylights out of you as Margaret, Carrie&#8217;s mother. She&#8217;s pure venom, without any redeeming qualities, but that&#8217;s exactly what this character should be. While nobody can do it as well as Sissy Spacek, &#8220;Carrie&#8221; will allow for a new audience to eat up this delicious and sometimes tragic story. It follows the remake formula a little too closely, but if you go in more or less expecting that, you&#8217;ll have a great time.Grade: A-",5,"Watch this without a predisposed bias, and you'll have a great time.",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,2271,"['Remakes', 'are', 'tricky', 'remake', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '8217', '8220', 'Psycho', '8221', '8217', 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'wrong', 'was', 'panned', 'universally', 'audiences', 'critics', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'exactly', 'same', 'movie', 'same', 'problem', 'followed', 'Kimberly', 'Pierce', '8217', '8220', 'Carrie', '8221', 'adaptation', 'NOVEL', 'important', 'note', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King.The', 'thing', 'new', '8220', 'Carrie', '8221', 'actually', 'layers', 'book', 'were', 'missing', 'original', 'film', '8217', 'not', 'better', 'original', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'make', 'bad', 'movie', 'don', '8217', 'think', 'two', 'better', 'actresses', 'year', '2013', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'lead', 'characters', 'Carrie', 'White', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Julianne', 'Moore.In', 'case', '8217', 're', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'Carrie', 'White', 'Moretz', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'mercilessly', 'bullied', 'classmates', '8217', '8216', 'different', '8217', 'Carrie', 'special', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'allowing', 'move', 'objects', 'people', 'hard', 'enough', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'epitome', 'bad', 'mothers', '8217', 'delusional', 'overly', 'religious', 'schizophrenic', 'When', 'one', 'nice', 'girl', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'take', 'Carrie', 'prom', 'hell', 'break', 'loose.Pierce', '8217', '8220', 'Carrie', '8221', 'more', 'focused', 'small', 'details', 'character', 'moments', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'difference', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'feel', 'remake', 'however', 'story', 'essentially', 'same', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'very', 'respected', 'actress', 'performance', 'here', 'indication', 'whole', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'Not', 'easy', 'thing', 'sixteen-year-old', 'girl', 'do.Feeling', 'perfectly', 'comfortable', 'role', 'Moore', 'will', 'scare', 'living', 'daylights', 'Margaret', 'Carrie', '8217', 'mother', '8217', 's', 'pure', 'venom', 'redeeming', 'qualities', '8217', 'exactly', 'what', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'nobody', 'can', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', '8220', 'Carrie', '8221', 'will', 'allow', 'new', 'audience', 'eat', 'up', 'delicious', 'sometimes', 'tragic', 'story', 'remake', 'formula', 'little', 'too', 'closely', 'go', 'more', 'less', 'expecting', '8217', 'll', 'have', 'great', 'time.Grade', 'A-']",Carrie

1604984,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00A2H9WW8,M. Oleson,"[5, 8]","Theatrical Review.  There may be spoilers.Director, Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Don't Cry"") is a friend of Brian DePalma, the director of the original 1976 thriller, so I'm sure he provided the proper encouragement to update this excellent Stephen King story.  And yes, the film is updated with picture-taking cell phones, music, cars and clothing.  Unfortunately the film is also pretty boring.  Chloe Grace Moretz (""Kick-Ass"") is certainly more age-appropriate to the character of Carrie than the 20-something Sissy Spacek in the original.  This Carrie, while still withdrawn and insecure, is also a little quicker to ""come-out"" in terms of her kinetic powers.With a bone chilling opening scene, Margaret White (excellent Julianne Moore) is in the process of birthing baby Carrie and comes fractionally close to plunging a pair of scissors into the baby's skull thinking she is the offspring of the Devil himself.  Clearly mentally unstable, Margaret's motherly instincts override her original impulses.  But as Carrie grows, she is sheltered from the real world and is forced to spend time in a prayer closet for such improprieties as suffering the onset of menses.Carrie is the brunt of brutal bullying at school, which is led by Chris (Portia Doubleday).  When Chris refuses to repent, she is expelled and can't go to the prom.  Her revenge is centered back on poor Carrie who gets to go to the prom with Tommy (Ansel Elgort).  He's the boyfriend of Sue (Gabriella Wilde) who does feel guilty and is trying to make amends.  So if you're familiar with the story you know what comes next and I was admittedly anxious for it to start.  But even updated with new CGI special effects, I wasn't transfixed like I was with the '76 version.  In that film, the first thing that happens is all the doors to the high school shut down tight, keeping everyone enclosed in a big room where Carrie can do her damage.  Here, people are escaping (or not) through various exit opportunities.I will admit that Moore's portrayal of the deranged momma Margaret is very convincing and very good.

Hinds,"[5, 13]","Basically, you have a reimagining of the classic horror tale about Carrie White, a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother, who unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far at her senior prom.  What makes this superior is the casting of Chlo Grace Moretz, as Carrie White.  Yes, the mean girl classmates are super mean, her mother is an over the top Religious Zealot, stupidly forcing her beliefs on Carrie (and Julianne Moore, as her mother, really knows how to play stupid).  The most amazing character about actress Chlo Grace Moretz, is the way she transforms herself as character Carrie.  One moment, she is mild, introverted Carrie then when she finds her powers, she is totally changed.  What really sets the version apart from the others, is we become engrossed, mesmerized, and hypnotized by Carrie (Chlo Grace Moretz).  Yes, the Computer-generated imagery is a little to much and distracting at times.

Carrie is bullied by some of the most popular girls in school, and they push Carrie too far, then Carrie uses her newly found telekinesis powers to dispense good ole fashion justice.  With all of this going on, Carrie has an overbearing religious mother.  That's all I really want to say about the plot.The casting is amazing.  Let's start off with Chloe Moretz. Chloe knocks the role of Carrie out of the park.  She does such a nice job with the role. Chloe adds such an emotional element to Carrie.  The shower scene was so emotional, my heart broke for her. She was the victim, and she didn't deserve what the girls did to her.  Chloe played it perfectly.  When it came for Carrie to get revenge on her bullies, you can't help but to cheer for her. Chloe is such an amazing actress.  Moore played Carrie's mom, and she did such a nice job. When he was on screen, my heart was actually pounding with uneasiness, it was such a good performance.  As for the bullies of Carrie, we don't like them, and we were meant not to, the bullies played such a good part. When they got what they deserved, you didn't feel sorry for them.I can't say enough good things about this movie. If you've seen the original, and liked it, go see this one. You'll love it.

I found Moore to be whether boring and flat.  Same can be said for the young lady Chloe Grace Moretz (who I liked in 'Let Me In') who played Carrie.  I didn't sympathize as strongly as Sissy and when I read the book.  The only person who stood out slightly was the guy who played Tommy.  He was at least trying and giving some effort.Now as for the graphics, had not been for the graphics, this personally been a one star movie.

To me, the story is timeless and resonant, and for adolescents in particular, the story of CARRIE packs a powerful punch. Several things surprised me about Kimberly Pierce's ""reimagining"" of CARRIE as a contemporary horror film - firstly, it is in many ways a shot by shot remake of the superior DePalma film; secondly, where it DOES deviate from DePalma's film, it fails (in some cases embarrassingly so) by comparison; and thirdly, the lead of this CARRIE is ALL WRONG.  Chloe is far too self-aware and bold as a young woman to ever convey the tragically sad Carrie White.  For me, the impressive pyrotechnics and CGI that fill the last hour might have actually been worth the re-tread had we been as engaged with the character as we were with the spookily perfect Sissy Spacek.

Most schools have multiple students with the same name, but if the other student Carrie's aren't important to the story, why have the main character referred to so oddly. Suspect the filmmakers wanted the way the other characters spoke about her as meant to tell audience that she was so weird the locals used her entire name in their small town, but the use only came off as unauthentic and fake as kids in real life wouldn't speak this way.

1605053,A3LDFTSXU3UPBO,B00A2H9WW8,Tim &#34;Timdiana&#34; Dunn,"[1, 4]","In 1974,  Stephen King released a tale of a troubled girl with the ability to move things with her mind. In 1976, that story became a horror film that went to become a classic. In 1999, a sequel was made and it was soon forgotten. Now, in 2013, a horror remake has hit theaters, and that film is simply called Carrie.Directed by Kimberly Pierce along with producer Kevin Misher and screenwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the team wanted to bring a refined adaption of Stephen King's novel to the silver screen. To give the movie even more credit, acclaimed actresses Chloe Grace Mortez and Julianne Moore were added to the film. With good stars and keeping true to the story, what could possibly go wrong for Carrie? Well, nothing to be honest.If you know the story of Carrie, then you should know that the remake's plot follows the Novel, as well as the 1976 film, to the letter. When it comes to the plot point,  it seems the only differences in this remake are the locations.  That being said, I think what helps the remake's story are additional scenes. Having moments like Carrie testing her powers make all the difference. I think what makes this film's story good is its pacing and willingness to tell the story of Carrie and everyone around her.I'm mixed about the character of Carrie. Sissy Spacek certainly made a name for herself when she played the character in 1976; and no shock in why. Spacek played a troubled girl who was just aching to fit in. However, the same applies to Chloe Grace Mortez. She played the role to the best of her abilities; making her portrayal easy to understand and fully dimensional. As you can see, it is hard for me to decide who is better; but while the two performances are at a stalemate, it is the supporting cast that makes all the difference. While I can't say I was impressed with the performances of the high-school characters,  most of them seem to have a reason for their intentions oppose to just being cliches. The only character I can take a points away from is Gabrielle Wilde's Sue. While both version of the character try to do the right the thing, it seemed that the new version of Sue was little too preachy.Then there is Julianne Moore as Carrie's mother, Margret. I have to say, Julianne Moore shows her talent in this role. The character of Margret White is far more frightening then her 1976 incarnation. The reason for this is subtlety. Julianne's performance was not as over the top as Piper Laiure; which made her that more frightening.I think the big question that this film is trying to answer is whether or not Carrie can be contemporary or is it dated? While certain themes could have been stronger, I think the filmmakers did a great job bringing the story of Carrie to year o 2013. Yet, as I said, I think what would  have  sold a different approach for the film would have been theme of bullying. While it is touched upon, I'm not sure the movie hit the mark at grasping the idea bullying and how it is reflected in today's society. While it was a good attempt, the theme could have been stronger.When we think of Carrie, no doubt we think of the story's major scene where Carrie gets soaked in pig's blood and all hell breaks loose.  When I saw the remake today, I thought this was the weaker scene oppose to the 1976 film. However, after seeing the original again, I have had a second opinion. While the scene might not as much practical effects, it was excited to see. There was nothing in the sequence that was distracting and it made easier to enjoy the rage of Carrie.I know many will not agree, but I have to say: The Carrie Remake is the best film to have the name Carrie to it. Sure there are issues, but the movies strengths comes in its execution. This remakes resurrect Stephen King's story for a new generation; and Carrie has never looked better.You can also see the review here: [...]",4,The Best Film Named Carrie,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,3871,"['1974', 'Stephen', 'King', 'released', 'tale', 'troubled', 'girl', 'ability', 'move', 'things', 'mind', '1976', 'story', 'became', 'horror', 'film', 'went', 'become', 'classic', '1999', 'sequel', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'soon', 'forgotten', 'Now', '2013', 'horror', 'remake', 'hit', 'theaters', 'film', 'simply', 'called', 'Carrie.Directed', 'Kimberly', 'Pierce', 'producer', 'Kevin', 'Misher', 'screenwriter', 'Roberto', 'Aguirre-Sacasa', 'team', 'wanted', 'bring', 'refined', 'adaption', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'silver', 'screen', 'give', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'credit', 'acclaimed', 'actresses', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Mortez', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'were', 'added', 'film', 'good', 'stars', 'keeping', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'Carrie', 'Well', 'nothing', 'be', 'honest.If', 'know', 'story', 'Carrie', 'then', 'should', 'know', 'remake', 'plot', 'Novel', 'as', 'well', '1976', 'film', 'letter', 'When', 'plot', 'point', 'only', 'differences', 'remake', 'are', 'locations', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'what', 'remake', 'story', 'are', 'additional', 'scenes', 'Having', 'moments', 'Carrie', 'testing', 'powers', 'make', 'difference', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'story', 'good', 'pacing', 'willingness', 'tell', 'story', 'Carrie', 'everyone', 'her.I', ""'m"", 'mixed', 'character', 'Carrie', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'certainly', 'made', 'name', 'herself', 'when', 'played', 'character', '1976', 'shock', 'why', 'Spacek', 'played', 'troubled', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'aching', 'fit', 'However', 'same', 'applies', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Mortez', 'played', 'role', 'best', 'abilities', 'making', 'portrayal', 'easy', 'understand', 'fully', 'dimensional', 'can', 'see', 'hard', 'decide', 'who', 'better', 'two', 'performances', 'are', 'stalemate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'difference', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'performances', 'high-school', 'characters', 'most', 'seem', 'have', 'reason', 'intentions', 'oppose', 'just', 'being', 'cliches', 'only', 'character', 'can', 'take', 'points', 'away', 'Gabrielle', 'Wilde', 'Sue', 'version', 'character', 'try', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'seemed', 'new', 'version', 'Sue', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'preachy.Then', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Carrie', 'mother', 'Margret', 'have', 'say', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'talent', 'role', 'character', 'Margret', 'White', 'far', 'more', 'frightening', 'then', '1976', 'incarnation', 'reason', 'subtlety', 'Julianne', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'top', 'Piper', 'Laiure', 'made', 'more', 'frightening.I', 'think', 'big', 'question', 'film', 'trying', 'answer', 'not', 'Carrie', 'can', 'be', 'contemporary', 'dated', 'certain', 'themes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'Carrie', 'year', 'o', '2013', 'said', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'sold', 'different', 'approach', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'theme', 'bullying', 'touched', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'hit', 'mark', 'grasping', 'idea', 'bullying', 'how', 'reflected', 'today', 'society', 'was', 'good', 'attempt', 'theme', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger.When', 'think', 'Carrie', 'doubt', 'think', 'story', 'major', 'scene', 'where', 'Carrie', 'soaked', 'pig', 'blood', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'When', 'saw', 'remake', 'today', 'thought', 'was', 'weaker', 'scene', 'oppose', '1976', 'film', 'However', 'seeing', 'original', 'again', 'have', 'had', 'second', 'opinion', 'scene', 'might', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'practical', 'effects', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'was', 'nothing', 'sequence', 'was', 'distracting', 'made', 'easier', 'enjoy', 'rage', 'Carrie.I', 'know', 'many', 'will', 'not', 'agree', 'have', 'say', 'Carrie', 'Remake', 'best', 'film', 'have', 'name', 'Carrie', 'Sure', 'are', 'issues', 'movies', 'strengths', 'execution', 'resurrect', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'new', 'generation', 'Carrie', 'never', 'looked', 'better.You', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'review', 'here', '[', ']']",Carrie

The remake of Carrie isn't all that different from the original, just modernized, as Carrie is a loser, who with puberty discovers an amazing power. She tries to hide it, but when pushed, ultimately uses it for evil, it's a classic Stephen King story, that most people already know and there in lies part of the problem. Assuming that most people know the story, a lot of information about Carrie is omitted, leaving the film little to go on.

She had hopes, she had fears, but we pushed her and you can only push someone so far before they break.&#34; Carrie White (Moretz) is an awkward outcast at her school and a daughter of an overbearing mother (Moore) at home. Carrie also has a special power that she tries to keep hidden but you can only hide your true self for so long. I have been saying for a long long time now that Hollywood is out of ideas. If it's not a comic book movie then it seems remakes of TV shows and old movies are all that is being made. Going in to this I wasn't that excited because 9 out of 10 times the remakes are awful. This one is the 10th one. It has been awhile since I have seen the original but I really did end up enjoying this one.

Although I haven't seen the original in awhile from what I remember they didn't really change too much of it for this one. Depending on how you feel that is either a good thing or a bad thing.

I have seen the Original, The Rage Carrie 2, the Made for TV Version, and I was EAGERLY AWAITING this version when I heard they were doing it.  Happily and Joyfully I can admit this isn't a Shot For Shot Remake.  There is so much New Information that you get to see in this version.  From the opening Scene where you witness Margaret Giving Birth to Carrie to seeing how B!^&#y Chris Actually IS.  Watching Carrie actually Learning to Control her Power is nice too, We didn't get to see much of that in the other versions, cause it was just Minimally touched on.  You get to see how much Sue Regrets what they did and why she TRIES to do the right thing asking Tommy to take her to Prom.  We also get to see how Truly Psychotic Margaret is, and in this roll Julianne Moore Really SHINES.  In the Commentary Kimberly Peirce talks about how they worked Extensively with Chloe to Help her change from the ""Confident"" Girl we all know her as to the kind of girl that can be a Convincing Downcast Underdog this roll calls for, and she pulls off the roll SPLENDIDLY.  The Showdowns between Carrie and Margaret are Wonderful Visions to behold, from the fight over the Prom, to the night of the prom.  At this time I will say something about the Prom [but this isn't going to be a spoiler] is that in this version she isn't killing EVERYONE just cause they are there, She is Actually going after JUST the ones that caused the worst of the problems that brought her to her Breaking Point at Prom.  Any others that are hurt are not Intended.  There is a Nice Twist at the Ending which I won't even talk about, and if you want a scene close to the Original, you should get the Bluray so you can see the Alternate Ending, though it isn't like the Original Ending it is a little more....  Intense [for Sue at least].  If you don't want to see a Wonderful and Refreshing version of a classic that we all Know and Love [or if you aren't going to be open for some New Territory] then don't watch it.  However if you are anything like me who will give Anything a chance with an Open Mind then this is a movie that should NOT BE MISSED.  I love the Carrie Story so Much that I own All the Incarnations of the movie and love them all.  This is such a Wonderful and Refreshing telling of the story for a new generation.

The problem is, I see no point in remaking or ""re-imagining"" the 1970s cult classic.Those who have seen the 1976 original directed by Brian De Palma know the story. It is about a 17-year-old girl Carrie White (Chlo Grace Moretz), bullied and abused, who suddenly discover that she has a special power. In the meanwhile, a girl banned from the prom concocts a plan with her boyfriend, to humiliate Carrie in front of the students.The director is Kimberly Peirce of ""Boys Don't Cry"" fame, and she clearly thinks, rightly, that ""Carrie"" is more than just a scary tale. It is also a sad coming-of-age story about a lonely soul, and Chlo Grace Moretz becomes one in a very convincing way - when the film does not overuse the special effects.For visual effects are a little disappointing during and after the famous prom scene. Also, Chlo Grace Moretz, talented as she is, may be a little miscast as Carrie White, who looks less creepy and menacing than the one played by Sissy Spacek.As you expect, Julianne Moore steals scenes as Carrie's abusive mother, but the rest of the supporting players are not very memorable.

Carrie has always been the subject of ridicule by classmates. Carrie&#8217;s mom is deeply religious and has harsh restrictions on her. However, everything started to turn the other way for Carrie when popular lacrosse star Tommy Ross ask her to the biggest dance of the year, prom. Some people weren&#8217;t too fond of her going and set out to ruin it for her. Did they go too far?This is a classic Stephen King novel about a girl who posses strong telekinetic powers. If she can think it, she can control it. There are some small differences between the movie and book but only a couple major differences. In the book they described Carrie noticing her powers when she was a small child over an argument she had with a kid in the neighborhood. In the movie, she notices her powers around her senior year of high school in the gym locker room. The other major differences you would have to rent the movie and see for yourself.My biggest problem about the movie is how they didn&#8217;t go into more detail about Carrie&#8217;s powers. They showed her noticing that she is gifted in a way but keeps playing out the story. By the end of the movie she is able to do things that would seem to maybe take years of practice but she learned in the matter of days. The things she could do at the end of the movie made it cool, but just seemed fast paced.This is not a movie that will make you jump out your seats. It is not a movie that is really that suspenseful. Right now this movie is currently out on Redbox and is worth renting for $1.20 but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend buying it.&#8220;Shaken, Not Stirred&#8221; Rating: 5.3/10Read more reviews at Bond's Movie Reviews on Facebook",3,Needs to go into more detail,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1797,"['Carrie', 'remake', '1976', 'classic', 'horror', 'movie', 'where', 'shy', 'young', 'girl', 'Carrie', 'White', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'Carrie', 'always', 'been', 'subject', 'ridicule', 'classmates', 'Carrie', '8217', 's', 'mom', 'deeply', 'religious', 'harsh', 'restrictions', 'However', 'everything', 'started', 'turn', 'other', 'way', 'Carrie', 'when', 'popular', 'lacrosse', 'star', 'Tommy', 'Ross', 'biggest', 'dance', 'year', 'prom', 'people', 'weren', '8217', 't', 'too', 'fond', 'going', 'set', 'out', 'ruin', 'Did', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'classic', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'girl', 'who', 'strong', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'can', 'think', 'can', 'control', 'are', 'small', 'differences', 'movie', 'book', 'only', 'couple', 'major', 'differences', 'book', 'described', 'Carrie', 'noticing', 'powers', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'argument', 'had', 'kid', 'neighborhood', 'movie', 'powers', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'gym', 'locker', 'room', 'other', 'major', 'differences', 'would', 'have', 'rent', 'movie', 'see', 'yourself.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'how', 'didn', '8217', 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'Carrie', '8217', 's', 'powers', 'showed', 'noticing', 'gifted', 'way', 'playing', 'out', 'story', 'end', 'movie', 'able', 'do', 'things', 'would', 'seem', 'maybe', 'take', 'years', 'practice', 'learned', 'matter', 'days', 'things', 'could', 'do', 'end', 'movie', 'made', 'cool', 'just', 'seemed', 'fast', 'paced.This', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'jump', 'out', 'seats', 'not', 'movie', 'really', 'suspenseful', 'Right', 'now', 'movie', 'currently', 'out', 'Redbox', 'worth', 'renting', '1.20', 'wouldn', '8217', 'recommend', 'buying', 'it.', '8220', 'Shaken', 'Not', 'Stirred', '8221', 'Rating', '5.3/10Read', 'more', 'reviews', 'Bond', 'Movie', 'Reviews', 'Facebook']",Carrie

1605069,AP3B615GM191G,B00A2H9WW8,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[46, 65]","Usually, when watching a remake of a great movie, I'm looking for something new that it adds to the story or characters.  If it doesn't bring anything fresh or original to the table, then why step in again at all?  &#34;Carrie&#34; is an exception to that rule, however, as instead of providing any substantially new material it essentially gives the story/character an update into modern cinema.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Carrie&#34; tells the story of young Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz), a strange girl who lives with her religious fanatic mother Margaret (Julianne Moore).  When Carrie is humiliated at school after unknowingly receiving her first &#34;curse of blood&#34; (menstrual period) in the women's locker room, she begins to develop inexplicable telekinetic powers.  Drawing the ire of school &#34;mean girl&#34; Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) but gaining the friendship of Sue Snell (Gabrielle Wild), Carrie is asked to prom by Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) in what turns out to be the defining night of her life in more ways than one.Despite being little more than a straight remake of the original, I still thoroughly enjoyed the concept of the new &#34;Carrie&#34; because of how it brings the story into the modern cinematic cannon.  This is one of the great coming-of-age stories ever told (adapted from the pen of Stephen King, his first widely successful written work), but getting the younger folk to see the original would be like pulling teeth.  Show them the trailer for Sissy Spacek's &#34;Carrie&#34; and they will blow it off as a &#34;typical weird 70s movie&#34; (which of course it isn't at all, but...). So, while the Carrie story didn't &#34;need&#34; to be remade, per se, as the original was so good, it did &#34;need&#34; to be remade in order to refresh the story for generations to come.Of course, one cannot help but compare this 2014 version with the 1976 original, and in doing so there are arguments for/against both interpretations.  For example, the ending to the original is much better and that film may actually have a little bit higher &#34;creepy&#34; factor due to the horrific Spacek facial reactions.  On the flip side, I like how this new version casts actors much closer to their &#34;screen age&#34;, giving the film a bit more of a &#34;believe-ability&#34; factor.One of the hallmarks of the original &#34;Carrie&#34; was always its incredible acting, and this version also continues that trend.  Moretz is a great Carrie (albeit in a different sort of fashion than Spacek's manic portrayal), while Moore remarkably matches Piper Laurie's complicated turn as Margaret White, who may just be the most interesting character of either film.  All the auxiliary players are also just fine, again just different from the &#34;household names playing teenagers way below their actual ages&#34; approach taken by the original.Overall, 2013's &#34;Carrie&#34; is a wonderfully spooky film that (in keeping with King's novel) is much more &#34;human/psychological drama&#34; than &#34;horror&#34;.  If pushed, I might have to give a slight nod to the original (but that is strictly because that 1976 movie was the first time I had ever been engulfed in the challenging, uncomfortable story that defines &#34;Carrie&#34;).  However, this remake does a great job of updated the story/characters to present it in a way better suited for today's generation.  Had I been watching the narrative for the very first time with this movie, I think I would have had the same reactions I did upon my first viewing of the original.  &#34;Carrie&#34; is a story that deserves to live on through the generations, and this film makes it possible for it to do so.",5,Carrie For A New Generation,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,3701,"['Usually', 'when', 'watching', 'remake', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'story', 'characters', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'fresh', 'original', 'table', 'then', 'why', 'step', 'again', '34', 'Carrie', '34', 'exception', 'rule', 'however', 'instead', 'providing', 'substantially', 'new', 'material', 'essentially', 'story/character', 'update', 'modern', 'cinema.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Carrie', '34', 'story', 'young', 'Carrie', 'White', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'strange', 'girl', 'who', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'mother', 'Margaret', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'When', 'Carrie', 'humiliated', 'school', 'unknowingly', 'receiving', 'first', '34', 'curse', 'blood', '34', 'menstrual', 'period', 'women', 'locker', 'room', 'develop', 'inexplicable', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'Drawing', 'ire', 'school', '34', 'mean', 'girl', '34', 'Chris', 'Hargensen', 'Portia', 'Doubleday', 'gaining', 'friendship', 'Sue', 'Snell', 'Gabrielle', 'Wild', 'Carrie', 'asked', 'prom', 'Tommy', 'Ross', 'Ansel', 'Elgort', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'defining', 'night', 'life', 'more', 'ways', 'one.Despite', 'being', 'little', 'more', 'straight', 'remake', 'original', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'concept', 'new', '34', 'Carrie', '34', 'how', 'story', 'modern', 'cinematic', 'cannon', 'one', 'great', 'coming-of-age', 'stories', 'ever', 'told', 'adapted', 'pen', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first', 'widely', 'successful', 'written', 'work', 'getting', 'younger', 'folk', 'see', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'pulling', 'teeth', 'Show', 'trailer', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', '34', 'Carrie', '34', 'will', 'blow', 'off', '34', 'typical', 'weird', '70s', 'movie', '34', 'course', ""n't"", 'So', 'Carrie', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", '34', '34', 'be', 'remade', 'se', 'original', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'did', '34', '34', 'be', 'remade', 'order', 'refresh', 'story', 'generations', 'come.Of', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'compare', '2014', 'version', '1976', 'original', 'doing', 'so', 'are', 'arguments', 'for/against', 'interpretations', 'example', 'ending', 'original', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'higher', '34', 'creepy', '34', 'factor', 'due', 'horrific', 'Spacek', 'facial', 'reactions', 'flip', 'side', 'like', 'how', 'new', 'version', 'actors', 'much', 'closer', '34', 'screen', 'age', '34', 'giving', 'film', 'bit', 'more', '34', 'believe-ability', '34', 'factor.One', 'hallmarks', 'original', '34', 'Carrie', '34', 'was', 'always', 'incredible', 'acting', 'version', 'also', 'trend', 'Moretz', 'great', 'Carrie', 'different', 'sort', 'fashion', 'Spacek', 'manic', 'portrayal', 'Moore', 'remarkably', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'complicated', 'turn', 'Margaret', 'White', 'who', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'auxiliary', 'players', 'are', 'also', 'just', 'fine', 'again', 'just', 'different', '34', 'household', 'names', 'playing', 'teenagers', 'way', 'actual', 'ages', '34', 'approach', 'taken', 'original.Overall', '2013', '34', 'Carrie', '34', 'wonderfully', 'spooky', 'film', 'keeping', 'King', 'novel', 'much', 'more', '34', 'human/psychological', 'drama', '34', '34', 'horror', '34', 'pushed', 'might', 'have', 'give', 'slight', 'nod', 'original', 'strictly', '1976', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'engulfed', 'challenging', 'uncomfortable', 'story', '34', 'Carrie', '34', 'However', 'remake', 'great', 'job', 'updated', 'story/characters', 'present', 'way', 'better', 'suited', 'today', 'generation', 'Had', 'been', 'watching', 'narrative', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'reactions', 'did', 'upon', 'first', 'viewing', 'original', '34', 'Carrie', '34', 'story', 'live', 'generations', 'film', 'possible', 'do', 'so']",Carrie

It is so much like the novel, that I am proud to give it 5 stars.Moretz and Moore become their characters in such a frighteningly real way that you will be entranced by their performances.  Moore is horrifying all on her own.  When Carrie comes into her powers, we get a layer of scares to place on top of the already heart-breaking lunacy of her mother.  Just a great experience with a lot of suspense and tension.The effects are perfect.  The violence is tense, bloody, and disturbing.  The movie is perfectly paced, and it does justice to Stephen King's wonderful novel.  What else could you ask for from a novel adaptation?Buy it, if you are a Stephen King fan or horror fan in general.  And PRAY for a sequel.

Chlo Grace Moretz does a decent job and Juliane Moore is absolutely fantastic (She's actually the best thing about this film). The prom massacre scene is well done here as well. But, the problem here is that this film is practically a shot-for-shot remake and offers nothing new for anyone who has seen the original. It ended up being a rather boring film considering nothing here aside from the role of Carrie's mother is done better than it was in the original.If you've never seen the original, you will probably enjoy this as it is for the most part well made.
