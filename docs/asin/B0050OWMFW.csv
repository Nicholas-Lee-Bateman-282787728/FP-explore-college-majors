There's been a trend recently to put everything that's not a horror or intense drama into the ""comedy"" category.  I'm really hoping some of these movie related sites start to re-categorize movies into more appropriate categories.This was a light hearted drama, romance film.  Mainly a character development and situational romance were the focus and intention.  If the writers thought they were creating a comedy, they should actually view a few comedies and then compare their script.  There were jokes that played as dialogue, that didn't even make the characters in the movie laugh; instead they were annoyed, or groaning at another characters cut downs, or displays of ego.  Guess what, the audience was doing the same, groaning and being annoyed.This might be a good movie to watch late at night if you can't sleep.

Madison,"[14, 16]","Unlike many of our current black independent films that are comprised of stereotypes & buffoonery, this was a good independent film and one to be proud of.  The storyline was good, good actors were selected & the acting was not only good but also realistic.  This movie was very humorous & comprised of many good scenes, good lines & also good delivery, timing, body language & facial expressions that actually coincided with the lines, which is what brings the characters to life and makes not only the characters realistic but also the story.  Also, the sound track was very good and the great songs that were selected actually coincided with the scenes, unlike some songs that are played in films that have absolutely nothing to do with the scenes. Bottom line, it was refreshing to see a black independent film that was well thought out, tastefully executed and really relative to today's relationship issues.  It was along the lines of another movie I loved that was also well done titled, ""30 Years to Life.""  After watching this movie I looked at the credits to see who the writer was so I could look out for future movies from this writer, and to see what else he may have written.  I saw that he also wrote ""Love for Sale,"" which is another black independent film I've seen and really did like.  With that said, let me say Kudos to Russ Parr for a job well done. In closing I just have to say that Clifton Powell who is one of my favorite actors, must really have a great agent because there are not too many black films or plays, whether independent or a major motion picture that he's not in.
