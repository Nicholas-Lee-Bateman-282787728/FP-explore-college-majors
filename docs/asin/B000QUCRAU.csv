To a person who got divorced on Christmas and hates the holiday and takes it out on everyone in the airport terminal. Totally has a change of heart, from being the old scrooge.Loved the part when they were in lost baggage claim and boating down the hill. Hilarious movie.  Can't wait to watch it again.  Too bad it won't be out until April 1st.  That part sucks.  To long to wait. Other family members can't wait to see it.

I remembered seeing the trailers once upon a time and wasn't particularly attracted to it - pretty much decided it wasn't worth it - but as I was filling up my Netflix queue it came up as a suggestion and I thought 'what the heck'. So I added it and it came and I watched. I went in with extremely low expectations which of course influenced my opinion as it usually does. Even as I was watching the first part of it I'd resigned myself to not hating it but not liking it by the end. Then something happened. I don't know what or when, how or why, but I suddenly found myself really enjoying it, laughing out loud and thinking how tender - yes, and corny, but in a good way - some moments were. By the end I was in love. Yes, it's not the greatest movie ever made and it's got a lot of over used jokes that ""reek"" of Nickelodeon movies (no pun intended) but it has a certain charm to it that I couldn't resist and I gave it fives stars more for what it did to me than how it was all put together.

It is very good and really entertaining. It's good to see a childrens film that is more about the characters than special effects.The airport setting is well utilised - who wouldn't secretly like to rummage around the fabulous lost luggage mountains and who knew there were emergency equipment rooms like that? Shops, restaurants and cell blocks all play a part. The group of misfit to cool children are literally 'grounded' as their flights home at Christmas have been cancelled due to snow. As unaccompanied minors travelling home from boarding schools, divorced parents etc they create havoc and end up as grounded in the punishment sense but still manage to get the better of the adults.It is fast and funny with entertaining dialogue and a great set of actors. The children are the stars and literally run rings around the adults. There is an intelligent storyline behind all the mayhem too and it's a great Christmas feel good film.Highly recommended for children and for adults who now have pre teen children and liked 'The Breakfast Club' and 'Trains, Planes and Automobiles'.

For example: I HAVE been asked to remove my cross -- and that is NO joke.)Rant aside, this is a CLEAN, family-friendly movie (compare it to ""Deck The Halls"" & you will see what I mean) that is cute & funny throughout & features some cute, funny kids & has some really cool stunts & some hysterically funny situations & the underlying message does indeed include the ""reason for the season,"" even if they never did come right out & SAY it ...Oh yeah, & to be fair, I do have to point out that one of the kids in the movie IS portrayed as Jewish, but there are NO Christians & so the end result implies that religious people are in a tiny, kooky minority in this country ...Which makes it rather hard to explain the ending, because (as I stated in my rant) the IDEA of it is most definitely Christian ... & so it makes you wonder where they could have possibly gotten the IDEA, if they had never, ever been exposed to the values, traditions & beliefs of Christianity?But I digress.&lt;>&lt;",5,Oops.,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,2587,"['went', 'IN', 'theater', 'totally', 'prepared', 'HATE', 'movie', 'came', 'OUT', 'theater', 'totally', 'prepared', 'BUY', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'out', 'DVD', '\\o/Which', 'totally', 'completely', 'amazing', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'here', 'CHRISTMAS', 'movie', 'several', 'kids', 'trying', 'enjoy', 'CHRISTMAS', 'vacation', 'screech', 'Wait', 'minute', 'Rewind', 'Let', 'say', 'again', 'just', 'case', 'missed', 'Here', 'have', 'CHRISTMAS', 'movie', 'Get', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'movie', 'Yes', 'CHRISTMAS', 'movie', 'been', 'totally', 'completely', 'sanitized', 'stripped', 'down', 'stripped', 'clean', 'references', 'Christ', 'Christmas', 'God', 'Mary', 'Jospeh', 'Jesus', 'even', 'music', 'secular', 'mean', 'nary', 'menorah', 'nativity', 'scene', 'star', 'David', 'cross', 'religious', 'symbol', 'shape', 'form', 'kind', 'Yeah', 'baby', 'movie', 'CLEAN', 'A', 'WHISTLE', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'right-wing', 'wacko', 'kooky', 'religious', 'stuff', 'HERE', 'Religion', 'Police', 'forgot', 'erase', 'one', 'tiny', 'little', 'thing', 'Um.Er.Because', 'um', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'ENTIRE', 'UNDERLYING', 'THEME', 'MESSAGE', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'IS', 'CHRISTIAN.CHRISTIAN', 'Shh', 'Did', 'hear', 'Christian', 'left-wing', 'liberal', 'commie', 'pinkos', 'forgot', 'take', 'out', 'Christian', 'message', 'Yyyyyaaaaahhhhh', 'Heads', 'must', 'ROLL', 'why', 'love', 'movie', 'tee', 'hee', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'Note', 'people', 'sense', 'humor', 'commie', 'pinko', 'stuff', 'was', 'joke', 'Note', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'digress', 'work', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'therefore', 'KNOW', 'VERY', 'WELL', 'way', 'prevailing', 'wind', 'blows', 'regards', 'Christians', 'Christianity', 'example', 'HAVE', 'been', 'asked', 'remove', 'cross', 'joke', 'Rant', 'aside', 'CLEAN', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'compare', 'Deck', 'Halls', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'cute', 'funny', 'cute', 'funny', 'kids', 'really', 'cool', 'stunts', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'situations', 'underlying', 'message', 'indeed', 'include', 'reason', 'season', 'even', 'never', 'did', 'come', 'right', 'SAY', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'be', 'fair', 'do', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'kids', 'movie', 'IS', 'portrayed', 'Jewish', 'are', 'NO', 'Christians', 'so', 'end', 'result', 'implies', 'religious', 'people', 'are', 'tiny', 'kooky', 'minority', 'country', 'rather', 'hard', 'explain', 'ending', 'because', 'stated', 'rant', 'IDEA', 'most', 'definitely', 'Christian', 'wonder', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'gotten', 'IDEA', 'had', 'never', 'ever', 'been', 'exposed', 'values', 'traditions', 'beliefs', 'Christianity', 'digress.', 'lt', '>', 'lt']",N/A

Also, children shuttled between parents for each holiday.

1076996,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000QUCRAU,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[12, 14]","Let's face it, there is a subgenre of family films that prepubescents absolutely love, the one where the kids outsmart the evil, bumbling adults. Every generation has had them, from `The Little Rascals' to one of my personal childhood favorites, `The Goonies'. `Unaccompanied Minors' is yet another entry into this subgenre, sure to excite children into being even more wild and uncontrollable as we approach this holiday season.Part `Home Alone', part `The Great Escape', `Unaccompanied Minors' mixes elements from the two, but puts them on the ultimate sugar rush. When a blizzard hits the Midwest all flights are grounded on Christmas Eve, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded, most notably the `Unaccompanied Minors'.So what do you do with a bunch of rowdy, sugar filled, and parentless rug rats? Well if you are a grumpy, ""Scrooge-like"" airport manager played by stand up comedian Louis Black, you lock them in a basement and put Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) from `That 70's Show' in charge of them. Unfortunately for the upper brass of the airport there are a few youngsters who don't follow like the other ""sheep"" and sneak out only to cause some holiday mischief.What ensues is a cat and mouse-like chase throughout the airport as Spencer (Dyllan Christopher) and his newly found posse, the self proclaimed ""UM's"", attempt to save the Christmas spirit for Spencer's doubtful, younger sister. Of course some of the adventures along their quest are downright silly, including sliding down baggage chutes and a high speed, Looney Toons-ish sled race down a snowy, seemingly never ending, hill. Now ignoring the fact that a mountain-like hill next to an airport, which requires vast amount of flat space to operate, is completely illogical, it does make for an amusing scene in the context of `Unaccompanied Minors'.Granted there is enough material to keep the youngsters more than entertained, including even the faintest hint of romance for the few who are starting to realize the opposite sex might not have cooties after all, `Unaccompanied Minors' doesn't always forget the adults either. Perhaps the best nod to the begrudging parents who have been dragged to `Unaccompanied Minors' comes from the appearance of ""The Kid"" from `Bad Santa'. As one of the rouge members of ""The UM's"" the young actor, Brett Kelly, who warmed Billy Bob's icy heart a few Christmases back is back paying homage to his former character by quipping more of the strange and completely illogical jargon that we have come to love him for. Just wait until you hear his explanation of what Christmas really is.So if `Unaccompanied Minors' is just a bunch of smart mouth kids, running amok and causing hell for a bunch of adults on Christmas Eve, where exactly is the substantial value for families to take their children? Well by then end of the story everything comes together for some good old fashioned Christmas morals. Miracles happen, families, new and old, are reunited and of course our ""Scrooge"" character finally discovers the value of Christmas. In fact the sugar coated finale of `Unaccompanied Minors' is so sweet, and surprisingly fulfilling, that many of the illogical, childish happenings throughout the film can be forgiven.In a way `Unaccompanied Minors' isn't anything we haven't seen before. It follows in the same vein as its brethren wholeheartedly. While it may not be as good as the films that came before it, `Unaccompanied Minors' is a surprisingly fun treat that the whole family can enjoy.
