1152531,A4U27URFECK1U,B001675ZI8,"Chris Damon ""Classic TV & Tech Guy""","[0, 0]","Besides A few episodes that use syndicated transfers which have pretty crappy audio tracks and some dark video, this set is really nice. From the first episode to the last you can see how Route 66 started to evolve and get its format down. Originally, the end credits rolled over a moving image, but after a few episodes that changed to a still image. Buzz and Todd's character's get tweaked and you get to know them as I think Martin Milner and George Maharis get to know them at the same time. This is GREAT series, but you WILL want the whole series after seeing Season 1, so getRoute 66: The Complete Series, which is on Shout Factory who owns the rights after Infinity/Roxbury went broke. Originally Season 1 was released by Infinity/Roxbury in parts. The second part was released in an artificial widescreen format that cut off parts of the picture. This was corrected in the FULL Season 1 release (This item) and is also fixed with the Shout Factory release. Basically, Shout Factory bought the film elements that Infinity/Roxbury had and reissued them under their name. Whatever episodes were missing (which weren't that many), syndicated video transfers are used, which accounts for horrible audio and dark video. Where the film elements are used the video is very clear, and the audio much better, though not up to today's standards, but the TV standards of 50 years ago.

1152533,AAUAOPPH3PBB2,B001675ZI8,Glenn M. Schoditsch,"[20, 23]","'Route 66' is one of the finest television anthology series ever produced.  With a somewhat dark and brooding tone, much like the 'Fugitive', the show jumps from town to city to state along the classic American corridor know as U.S highway route 66.  Brilliant screen writing and direction provide poignant drama as Tod Stiles and Buzz Murdock rediscover early 1960's social views and changing perspectives from the seats of a Chevrolet Corvette.Best news of all, it appears that the releasing studio has finally heard the pleas of America by halting the absurd practice of half season releases. Appropriately filmed in Black & White; as with ""The Fugitive', this is quality programming for the entire family.**UPDATE**  08.08.08I've noticed that with the Volume 1 discs, the video and audio is a bit on the muddy side, probably due to the most affordable source material Infinity decided to spend on this venture.  And as another reviewer stated , the elapsed time & chapters are missing on the Volume 2 discs but this happens on only select players.BUT, Infinity IS listening to its customers; restoring the OAR and putting the entire 1st season out as a single set.  And at a reasonable price too!  At least Infinity/Roxbury is moving in the right direction.  The Mob bosses at Paramount could take some lessons from them!**UPDATE**  08.28.08I just finished episode 30.  WOW!  What a show!Route 66 - The Complete Second Seasoncontinues this great anthology!

It's GOOD News, Actually!Complete 1st Season set still coming; 2nd Season isn't scrapped either!by David Lambert (tvshowsondvd), 4/29/2008Back in mid-March we reported that Infinity Entertainment and Roxbury Entertainment were planning on May 20th releases on DVD for both Route 66 - The Complete 1st Season AND Route 66 - Season 2, Volume 1. Late last week fans of the show started writing in to us, highly concerned that online pre-orders they had placed for one or both of these were being canceled. What's going on? We talked to Infinity, and we've got the scoop on what's happening...and it turns out that it's a good thing, actually.Along the course of putting out the first DVD packages, Infinity (and Roxbury) recognized that there was some customer dissatisfaction with the half-season sets put out for the first season, and they want to resolve this. To begin with, they are scrapping the half-season set concept at this time. As a result, Season 2, Vol. 1 is completely canceled. Instead, though, we will get a Complete Season 2 DVD package! It's currently penciled in for an October release, but that's not finalized just yet.In the meantime, the release of The Complete Season 1 DVD set IS still coming out. But it's being pushed back to release sometime in August, in order to give the studio more time to resolve customer complaints about how episodes were presented on disc in the two half-season sets for that show. There has not been any word yet as to whether Infinity will offer any sort of ""upgrade/fix"" path for people who purchased the original versions and wish to get the corrected versions, but we'll let you know if we hear anything.We'll bring you the specific new release date for Route 66 - The Complete 1st Season once it's been determined, and we'll also bring you the release date for Route 66 - The Complete 2nd Season when that's announced.

1152538,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B001675ZI8,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[6, 6]","Route 66 centered on two young men, who traveled together in a sleek Corvette. The car was bequeathed to one of the main characters, named Tod, by his dead father. His traveling companion was named Buzz. Tod and Buzz were actually polar opposites. Tod came from an affluent background, and had an education that he'd acquired from Harvard. On the other hand, Buzz was a street-wise young tough, who grew up in the urban jungle of 'hell's kitchen', in NYC.Tod and Buzz were seeking adventure during their travels, and they often got more than they bargained for. As they made their way from town to town, they frequently got into some serious skirmishes, that they were barely able to escape. They also got to assist many of the people that they met, in one way or another. In this way, the show resembled the story-line of the Fugitive, which was also an enormously popular 60s drama series.George Maharis as Buzz, and Martin Milner as Tod, projected a good on-screen rapport, as the two road buddies. George had a more charismatic appeal as an actor, than Martin Milner did. The cinematography in this show was amazing. Especially considering that the show was produced in the early 60s, before the high-tech film cameras of today were available. The scenery in general, was always one of the most enjoyable parts of Route 66.This was a quality TV drama series. And it was prescient regarding the restlessness of young people, that would intensify by the latter part of the 1960s. In this way, the show was really on the cutting-edge of hipness.
