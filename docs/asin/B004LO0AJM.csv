1413181,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B004LO0AJM,David Bower,"[9, 10]","This movie was a gift and we watched it for the first time this afternoon; my wife and I were both deeply moved by this movie and inspired by the solid values it so ably presents. This is the story of a WW II romance that tracks the experience of so many young couples of the era. The flashbacks to that time were effective and brought back many memories.During the Second World War my wife and I were still in public school and both of us recall the various activities that involved the civilian population during that time. The music was all very familiar as were the references to collecting scrap metal for the war effort, the victory gardens that almost everyone in our neighborhood had, and the flags with stars draped in the windows showing the number of family members away in the armed forces.All of this is firmly engraved in my memory and this movie brought them back with force as this tender love story was told. The settings, the ambience, the music are all effectively done to give the viewer a small glimpse of life in the 1940's.The story focuses on a WW II widow who had a special method for remembering her missing husband; this comes to the attention of a TV station who decides to feature her in a TV program. The widow is marvelously played by Betty White who brings a tender and touching conviction to the role. The young TV reporter, played by the lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt, is at first skeptical of the assignment but begins to develop a loving concern for the elderly widow and decides to carry the assignment on to its conclusion.The movie switches from the contemporary story to the WW II romance with a series of flashbacks. It is these flashbacks that so effectively convey the feelings of the WW II era. The director, Darnell Martin does a fine job of coordinating the various parts into a most remarkable whole, creating a glimpse of the past as well as a tribute to the love between a man and his wife.This movie is grand family fare and worthy of repeated watchings; it has moments of emotional intensity which will move the great majority of viewers.

1413189,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B004LO0AJM,J. Olsen,"[48, 49]","As the latest addition to the Hallmark Hall of Fame Library, this movie does not disappoint. Hewitt plays Susan Allison, a young woman who is a human interest reporter. She is assigned to cover a story about a woman named Caroline (Betty White) who sent her husband, Neil, off to WWII on Valentines day many decades ago. As she was patiently keeping the home fires burning she gave birth to their son. When her husband was reported MIA a year after shipping out, she initially hoped to find him among the returning wounded in the veterans hospital, but in time she just visited every week to read to the soldiers, a tradition she had continued through the years. She had also continued to visit Union Station, where she had said goodbye to Neil, every Valentine's Day, for 60+ years. The story of her courtship and marriage is told through flashback as she is being interviewed for the news story. Susan was initially hesitant about the whole thing, but as she becomes involved with Caroline, she also becomes involved with her grandson. He is a handsome young physical therapist, whose perspective on life is a stark contrast to that of her own boyfriend, Andrew, who recently proposed. As Susan becomes more immersed in the story of Caroline Thomas she puts her job on the line in order to try and discover what happened to Neil Thomas all those years ago.The story is a great tribute to those who served in WWII, and to those left behind that rallied together to support the troops. It is an emotional journey as you follow Caroline's memories from ""love at first sight"" to the last sight of her love. Betty White is incredible and believable as the woman who had faced life with courage in spite of her suffering. The entire cast does justice to this moving and inspiring story. It is family friendly, though the scene of some of the war action near the end of the movie may be too intense for small children.",5,An emotional journey--excellent acting by Betty White,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,1913,"['latest', 'addition', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'Library', 'movie', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Hewitt', 'Susan', 'Allison', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'human', 'interest', 'reporter', 'assigned', 'cover', 'story', 'woman', 'named', 'Caroline', 'Betty', 'White', 'who', 'sent', 'husband', 'Neil', 'off', 'WWII', 'Valentines', 'day', 'many', 'decades', 'ago', 'was', 'patiently', 'keeping', 'home', 'fires', 'burning', 'gave', 'birth', 'son', 'When', 'husband', 'was', 'reported', 'MIA', 'year', 'shipping', 'out', 'initially', 'hoped', 'find', 'returning', 'wounded', 'veterans', 'hospital', 'time', 'just', 'visited', 'week', 'read', 'soldiers', 'tradition', 'had', 'continued', 'years', 'had', 'also', 'continued', 'visit', 'Union', 'Station', 'where', 'had', 'said', 'goodbye', 'Neil', 'Valentine', 'Day', '60+', 'years', 'story', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'told', 'flashback', 'being', 'interviewed', 'news', 'story', 'Susan', 'was', 'initially', 'hesitant', 'whole', 'thing', 'involved', 'Caroline', 'also', 'involved', 'grandson', 'handsome', 'young', 'physical', 'therapist', 'perspective', 'life', 'stark', 'contrast', 'own', 'boyfriend', 'Andrew', 'who', 'recently', 'proposed', 'Susan', 'more', 'immersed', 'story', 'Caroline', 'Thomas', 'job', 'line', 'order', 'try', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'Neil', 'Thomas', 'years', 'ago.The', 'story', 'great', 'tribute', 'who', 'served', 'WWII', 'left', 'rallied', 'together', 'support', 'troops', 'emotional', 'journey', 'follow', 'Caroline', 'memories', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'last', 'sight', 'love', 'Betty', 'White', 'incredible', 'believable', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'faced', 'life', 'courage', 'spite', 'suffering', 'entire', 'cast', 'justice', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'story', 'family', 'friendly', 'scene', 'war', 'action', 'end', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'small', 'children']",The Lost Valentine Hallmark Hall of Fame

Fraught with her own lackluster love life, Susan does her job because she has to, but ends up caught up in Caroline's story, and the unfailing support of Caroline's grandson, Lucas. Both which makes her realize what's really missing in her life.God, really. Why don't guys like Lucas exist??? I digress...so okay, anyway, the movie did what it was supposed to do. Make us swoon, tear up a little and expect what we want: a feel good romantic movie with all the right lines and scenes.

However, that's your basic romance movie for you and it was done well enough. The cast is great, especially with seasoned actresses of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Betty White. Each actor gave us a character we can relate to and with just enough without it getting over the top or cheesy. They're believable and you feel for them. The pacing and editing was seamless; the production didn't feel stagey and even the music was great. My only complaint is that it ended too quickly!The last Hallmark movie that had me glued in and smiling like an idiot wasThe Love LetterandSarah, Plain & Tall Collection.
