1039918,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000LPS2TK,Buenoslibros.es,"[8, 17]","Those of us who have had family members work on the seas will appreciate this real life show better than others. It is not just the excitement of the risks involved, the dangerous weather conditions, or the roughness of the jobs you see on deck, it's much more. You get to watch real people whose worries and hopes you identify with, and you get to love them by learning to respect them in their sacrifices. In Spain there's a vast retired population that watches others work at construction sites and admires how things get done without their help. This maybe a type of voyeurism, but is something like what I felt while watching this series, without the loss of sleep or the sea-sickness. It is awe-inspiring and humbling to watch these men put their lives on the line for the sakes of their families and loved ones.There is the added interest of a competition taking place among many ships to see who gets the biggest share, a race against time and the natural elements, a psychological study of leadership and gregariousness, and finally it is an ode to the sea, its beauty and ruthless power, with stories of lost lives, sunk ships, faith and superstitions, love and friendship, hardship and memories. The few chapters I saw on tv were captivating, but now that I saw them on dvd I realized there is much more, there are stories of people, and you want to see how they will make it in the next chapter, what choices -if good or bad- they will make. The cynic may think it's just all about money (so the thief thinks everybody is like him) and that these people are not different from anybody else. The gambler doesn't risk his life, he risks his family wealth. These men risk their lives for the welfare of their families.One cannot but respect every single one of these men. May God bless them, and may their faith grow as their works, for: ""Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, ""You have faith, and I have works."" Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe and tremble!""
