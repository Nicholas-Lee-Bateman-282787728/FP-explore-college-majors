Years after its initial release, the images, music, and voices still tell one of the most powerful American tales of civil discord and strife in US history.  The film can be utilized in a variety of educational settings ranging from classroom instruction to personal interest.  All Americans should know the story of how the US was divided over the issue of slavery, of how so many died fighting for what they believed in, and of how the Republic continued to stand as the last best hope of Earth.Review by: Adam Platts",5,The Civil War - an excellent documentary.

289433,A2V40R97RU5NAB,6301996135,Allan W. Goodall,"[3, 7]","Ken Burns' Civil War is an excellent introduction to the period, told well with style. It's a documentary, not a history book. It is, however, far more accurate and balanced than other Civil War documentaries (such as the History Channel's Civil War Journal).To hit on a couple of criticisms in other reviews, slavery as a cause of the Civil War is an argument bordering on the level of a holy war, itself. Recent magazine articles and essays have done a good job of discussing it. The result is that both Burns' view and the &quot;Burns' is wrong, it was all about states rights&quot; views are both simplistic. Burns' documentary does a good job of capturing the Southern view of slavery and abolition but he does over state the view of the north as abolitionist. While there were Southern abolitionists and Southern soldiers who didn't care one way or another, Burns shows quite well that without slavery there would have been no war. (The statement that the South only fought for &quot;states rights&quot; was actually championed in the 1880s. If states rights were the only reason for fighting the war, why did the Confederate Constitution prevent any Confederate state from passing a law against slavery, even if that state wanted to abolish it?)To the point of Grant being the first Lt. General since Washington, Burns is both right and wrong. Winfield Scott was made Lt. General, but it was a brevet (something a little more than honorary) rank. It was a brevet specifically so that Washington would be the only man to have officially held that rank. This changed when Grant was given the rank.",5,Excellent Introduction,1004486400,"10 31, 2001",2001,1602,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'period', 'told', 'well', 'style', 'documentary', 'not', 'history', 'book', 'however', 'far', 'more', 'accurate', 'balanced', 'other', 'Civil', 'War', 'documentaries', 'such', 'History', 'Channel', 'Civil', 'War', 'Journal', '.To', 'hit', 'couple', 'criticisms', 'other', 'reviews', 'slavery', 'cause', 'Civil', 'War', 'argument', 'bordering', 'level', 'holy', 'war', 'Recent', 'magazine', 'articles', 'essays', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'discussing', 'result', 'Burns', 'view', 'quot', 'Burns', 'wrong', 'was', 'states', 'rights', 'quot', 'views', 'are', 'simplistic', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'Southern', 'view', 'slavery', 'abolition', 'state', 'view', 'north', 'abolitionist', 'were', 'Southern', 'abolitionists', 'Southern', 'soldiers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'way', 'Burns', 'quite', 'well', 'slavery', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'war', 'statement', 'South', 'only', 'fought', 'quot', 'rights', 'quot', 'was', 'actually', 'championed', '1880s', 'states', 'rights', 'were', 'only', 'reason', 'fighting', 'war', 'why', 'did', 'Confederate', 'Constitution', 'prevent', 'Confederate', 'state', 'passing', 'law', 'slavery', 'even', 'state', 'wanted', 'abolish', 'point', 'Grant', 'being', 'first', 'Lt.', 'General', 'Washington', 'Burns', 'right', 'wrong', 'Winfield', 'Scott', 'was', 'made', 'Lt.', 'General', 'was', 'brevet', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'honorary', 'rank', 'was', 'brevet', 'specifically', 'so', 'Washington', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'man', 'have', 'officially', 'held', 'rank', 'changed', 'when', 'Grant', 'was', 'given', 'rank']",N/A

289440,AFDYHKAH8AJDT,6301996135,A. Sloan,"[59, 61]","I used to watch documentaries with my dad when I was growing up from time to time.  Being African American and from the deep deep South (both parents from the Atlanta area) we never really watched the ones having to do with the Civil War or Black perspective because they tended to be slanted one way or the other.  I never wanted to see those kind of documentaries and my parents had such pained expressions on their faces whenever something of that nature was on tv it just wasn't worth it to me.  Seeing as my parents lived such trying times day to day when they were growing up, I guess they could never be interested in other's views since they lived it.Both my parents passed unexpectedly 2 months apart from each other my mother dying after my father. (This documentary originally aired literally days after my fathers passing.)  I know I was in shock from his loss at that time otherwise I never would have watched, but since it reminded me of watching documentaries with my him I watched it.....then I became captivated.The presentation rang so true, because it wasn't just opinion from the modern viewpoint feeding us information from their own perspective. There were period photos, correspondence, diaries from actual people and Good Lord...the MUSIC was wonderful.  Things from North and South, White and Black woven throughout giving authenticity to the series. It was like a tapestry.  ALL sides were never ever presented as a whole to see why things were as they were.  Especially in such an eloquent manner. Although I in no way agree with why any Southern slave holders (not just White,  but there were Native American and Black as well) felt the way they did, I began to understand that this was all they knew since the time this country began. Slavery was not aggressively addressed then because it was too divisive.Because slavery was too painful to speak of it was never examined in my household. It truly changed me, I HAD to know more.  Then when the movie ""Glory"" came out on video shortly afterwards I was a goner.  I became a true Civil War buff.

Wilson ""Atheen""","[6, 7]","Hal, a friend of mine from work, and I have similar reading interests, so it didn't surprise me to find out that he knew far more than I did about the Civil War.  I'd  recently taken a short course on the subject, a period in history that had not heretofore interested  me in the slightest, and was enthused over the text for the class, Battle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson (for which see my review).  In sharing that excitement with him, I discovered his own knowledge in that area--he's a nurse with a degree in engineering and a wide range of reading interests--and he recommended the Ken Burns collection of videos, The Civil War.  I have to agree with him, it is an entertaining work.The interviews with Shelby Foote are, as Hal suggested they were, the highlight of the film.  They make it worth viewing even for someone not necessarily interested in the Civil War era, and they might conceivably enkindle further curiosity.  His laid back and genteel style of address, his thorough knowledge of and apparent impartiality for both sides in the conflict, and his delightfully anecdotal approach to the subject were a pleasure to both hear and view.  (In fact this first introduction to the gentleman encouraged me to find out more information about him, ..., which gives a short biography and a list of publications by and about the man, some of which are available through Amazon.)The film's approach to the Civil War is, as it must be, through still photos of the event.  This is the first war the ravages of which were caught on film to be presented to the public of the time and preserved for posterity, and the first time that this type of journalism brought the horrors and the true cost of the war to the American breakfast table as no other medium had yet been able.  Although the modern viewer, used as he/she is to the visual terror of real time attacks on the World Trade Towers and the Gulf War may find the style more awkward, those of us who followed the Viet Nam War through the photojournalism of the time will feel a sort of recognition.  The film presents a series of black and white photos of the war, of family keepsake photos of  individual soldiers, of paintings and photos of some of the heroes of the war, and of the carnage of various battles.  These are interwoven with video film of battlefields, buildings and memorials as they have been preserved today.  Giving a more personal touch to these pictorial documents are the recitations of material from personal diaries, letters, and family anecdotes given by notable actors like Colleen Dewhurst, Jeremy Irons, Morgan Freeman, Sam Waterston, among others.My favorites of these recitations are the diary entries of Mary Chestnut ( by Julie Harris), a woman born in the antebellum south, who chronicled the events of the war from the first battle at Fort Sumpter to the surrender of Lee.  She was the wife and the daughter of  US Senators from South Carolina and a personal friend of Varina and Jefferson Davis, so she had extensive knowledge not only of the events of the era but of their political and social ramifications as well.  She later published the condensed form of her very extensive diaries as a book entitled A Diary from Dixie ... The candor and insight of her observations as read in the Civil War by Ken Burns made me curious enough about her to add some of the books by and about her to my own wish list!A stunning film, full of information and visually arresting, it leads the viewer to find out more.  I would recommend it as a classroom aid to teaching a subject that is often neglected by students as ""boring!""",5,"A stunning film, full of information and visually arresting",1019260800,"04 20, 2002",2002,3616,"['Hal', 'friend', 'mine', 'work', 'have', 'similar', 'reading', 'interests', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'find', 'out', 'knew', 'far', 'more', 'did', 'Civil', 'War', ""'d"", 'recently', 'taken', 'short', 'course', 'subject', 'period', 'history', 'had', 'not', 'heretofore', 'interested', 'slightest', 'was', 'enthused', 'text', 'class', 'Battle', 'Cry', 'Freedom', 'James', 'McPherson', 'see', 'review', 'sharing', 'excitement', 'discovered', 'own', 'knowledge', 'area', 'nurse', 'degree', 'engineering', 'wide', 'range', 'reading', 'interests', 'recommended', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'collection', 'videos', 'Civil', 'War', 'have', 'agree', 'entertaining', 'work.The', 'interviews', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'are', 'Hal', 'suggested', 'were', 'highlight', 'film', 'make', 'viewing', 'even', 'someone', 'not', 'necessarily', 'interested', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'might', 'conceivably', 'enkindle', 'further', 'curiosity', 'laid', 'back', 'genteel', 'style', 'address', 'thorough', 'knowledge', 'apparent', 'impartiality', 'sides', 'conflict', 'delightfully', 'anecdotal', 'approach', 'subject', 'were', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'view', 'fact', 'first', 'introduction', 'gentleman', 'encouraged', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'information', 'short', 'biography', 'list', 'publications', 'man', 'are', 'available', 'Amazon', 'film', 'approach', 'Civil', 'War', 'must', 'be', 'still', 'photos', 'event', 'first', 'war', 'ravages', 'were', 'caught', 'film', 'be', 'presented', 'public', 'time', 'preserved', 'posterity', 'first', 'time', 'type', 'journalism', 'brought', 'horrors', 'true', 'cost', 'war', 'American', 'breakfast', 'table', 'other', 'medium', 'had', 'yet', 'been', 'able', 'modern', 'viewer', 'used', 'he/she', 'visual', 'terror', 'real', 'time', 'attacks', 'World', 'Trade', 'Towers', 'Gulf', 'War', 'may', 'find', 'style', 'more', 'awkward', 'who', 'followed', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'War', 'photojournalism', 'time', 'will', 'feel', 'sort', 'recognition', 'film', 'series', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'war', 'family', 'keepsake', 'photos', 'individual', 'soldiers', 'paintings', 'photos', 'heroes', 'war', 'carnage', 'various', 'battles', 'are', 'interwoven', 'video', 'film', 'battlefields', 'buildings', 'memorials', 'have', 'been', 'preserved', 'today', 'Giving', 'more', 'personal', 'touch', 'pictorial', 'documents', 'are', 'recitations', 'material', 'personal', 'diaries', 'letters', 'family', 'anecdotes', 'given', 'notable', 'actors', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'others.My', 'favorites', 'recitations', 'are', 'diary', 'entries', 'Mary', 'Chestnut', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'woman', 'born', 'antebellum', 'south', 'who', 'chronicled', 'events', 'war', 'first', 'battle', 'Fort', 'Sumpter', 'surrender', 'Lee', 'was', 'wife', 'daughter', 'US', 'Senators', 'South', 'Carolina', 'personal', 'friend', 'Varina', 'Jefferson', 'Davis', 'had', 'extensive', 'knowledge', 'not', 'only', 'events', 'era', 'political', 'social', 'ramifications', 'well', 'later', 'published', 'condensed', 'form', 'very', 'extensive', 'diaries', 'book', 'entitled', 'Diary', 'Dixie', 'candor', 'insight', 'observations', 'read', 'Civil', 'War', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'made', 'curious', 'enough', 'add', 'books', 'own', 'wish', 'list', 'stunning', 'film', 'full', 'information', 'visually', 'arresting', 'viewer', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'would', 'recommend', 'classroom', 'aid', 'teaching', 'subject', 'often', 'neglected', 'students', 'boring']",N/A

From the strange accident of Wilmer McLean having the war start in his front yard and end in his front parlor, to the compelling prominent personalities of the war- Lincoln, Lee, Grant, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, Sherman, McClellan, et. al., to the soldiers in the field- Joshua Chamberlain, Elijah Hunt Rhodes, Sam Watkins, and the long list of historical figures that have become household names in American history, this documentary covers it all- and in compelling fashion.  The style of the documentary I think draws much from the late Shelby Foote, whoseThe Civil War: A Narrative (3 Vol. Set)is one of the best works on the Civil War ever written, and an excellent follow-up to those who like this documentary and would like to read more about it.  In any case, the personalities, the political issues, the problems, the set-backs, the terrible bloodshed, and the context of the war are all presented in compelling detail that really draws you in to the historical significance of the Civil War.The voices and, for the most part, the historians are all top-notch and help add drama and interest into the already compelling facts of the war, and make it a pleasure (if such a word can be used in context of the Civil War) to take in.Ken Burns deserves a lot of credit for taking on such an enormous task, assembling the voices, historians and data from thousands of sources- as the credits indeed show.

289448,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,6301996135,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[3, 3]","Ken Burns is noted for many find documentaries that leave little out and still keeps your attention. This time we get to set our ""way back"" machine to 1861 where we start with the cause of the Civil War. Now I know there are many causes for the Civil War as the one that I learned from my economics class was that it was economics. However, Kim Burns gives a more holistic look at what was happening at the time and the indicators that foretold of the war. Each chapter or section of this documentary is approximately an hour long we go through several titles such as ""A very Bloody Affair"" and ""Forever Free 1862"".What keeps this film from being a dry documentary is Ken Burns' balance between sounds and sights of the civil war re-created from sketches and extracted from books and drawings. To tie this together we get a talking head presentation from Shelby Foote. Shelby makes you feel like you are right there as he can describe in every detail any piece of the civil war that you care to ask about.One thing not to be overlooked is the voices in this presentation are those of popular actors. So be sure to watch the credits to find out whose voices are being used for which people are portrayed.I do not want to go into too much detail because that is why you are buying this documentary. However, it has something for everybody; for those that already know the Civil War it adds more depth and maybe a different spin on the politics and people of the time. This also works as one of the best introductions far superior to anything that I was able to receive in school history classes.This is also a must background reading for anybody in the military as everyone knows each war is different from the last but attitudes and sometimes knowledge of previous tactics can help carry you through the next.Even though the war is over while watching this documentary, you will find yourself kibitzing.Do not forget to buy the companion book to this film for contains many of the pictures and diagrams that were displayed so that you do not have to put the film back in to see this on the extras. Oh yes do not forget to look at the DVD extras.If like me you were fascinated with the presentation by Shelby Foote, do not forget to buy the three-volume set of civil war books, a narrative By Shelby Foote.The Civil War: An Illustrated HistoryThe Civil War: A Narrative (3 Volume Set)",5,"Ken Burns opens some eyes and makes you feel ""You are there""",1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,2382,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'noted', 'many', 'find', 'documentaries', 'leave', 'little', 'still', 'keeps', 'attention', 'time', 'get', 'set', 'way', 'back', 'machine', '1861', 'where', 'start', 'cause', 'Civil', 'War', 'Now', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'causes', 'Civil', 'War', 'one', 'learned', 'economics', 'class', 'was', 'was', 'economics', 'However', 'Kim', 'Burns', 'more', 'holistic', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'time', 'indicators', 'foretold', 'war', 'chapter', 'section', 'documentary', 'approximately', 'hour', 'long', 'go', 'several', 'titles', 'such', 'A', 'very', 'Bloody', 'Affair', 'Forever', 'Free', '1862', 'film', 'being', 'dry', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'balance', 'sounds', 'sights', 'civil', 'war', 're-created', 'sketches', 'extracted', 'books', 'drawings', 'tie', 'together', 'get', 'talking', 'head', 'presentation', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'Shelby', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'can', 'describe', 'detail', 'piece', 'civil', 'war', 'care', 'ask', 'about.One', 'thing', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'voices', 'presentation', 'are', 'popular', 'actors', 'So', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'credits', 'find', 'out', 'voices', 'are', 'being', 'used', 'people', 'are', 'portrayed.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'why', 'are', 'buying', 'documentary', 'However', 'something', 'everybody', 'already', 'know', 'Civil', 'War', 'more', 'depth', 'maybe', 'different', 'spin', 'politics', 'people', 'time', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'introductions', 'far', 'superior', 'anything', 'was', 'able', 'receive', 'school', 'history', 'classes.This', 'also', 'must', 'background', 'reading', 'anybody', 'military', 'everyone', 'war', 'different', 'last', 'attitudes', 'sometimes', 'knowledge', 'previous', 'tactics', 'can', 'help', 'carry', 'next.Even', 'war', 'watching', 'documentary', 'will', 'find', 'not', 'forget', 'buy', 'companion', 'book', 'film', 'contains', 'many', 'pictures', 'diagrams', 'were', 'displayed', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'put', 'film', 'back', 'see', 'extras', 'Oh', 'yes', 'do', 'not', 'forget', 'look', 'DVD', 'extras.If', 'were', 'fascinated', 'presentation', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'do', 'not', 'forget', 'buy', 'three-volume', 'set', 'civil', 'war', 'books', 'narrative', 'Shelby', 'Foote.The', 'Civil', 'War', 'Illustrated', 'HistoryThe', 'Civil', 'War', 'Narrative', '3', 'Volume', 'Set']",N/A

I doubt it is possible to make a documentary containing ALL the important facts from the war, and even if one were made I doubt I'd want to watch it.  The point is:  this one comes darn close.At somewhere around twelve hours, this documentary is a serious time investment, yet it is one well made.  Never before have I seen the Civil War brought to life like this.  Never before have I experienced the sights and firsthand accounts of those associated with the war.The historians (with the exception of Shelby Foote) are somewhat corny, but Foote makes up for that as the picture-perfect Southern scholar who is loaded with anecdotes from and about the war.  Also, the documentary follows closely the lives of two men (one from each side) who started out as privates, kept journals, and somehow survived the duration of the war.  Besides these two mens' accounts there are many direct quotes from the generals and leaders involved in each of the major actions of the war.I agree that this isn't the definitive account of the war.  Shelby Foote couldn't do it in three (big) volumes, and I doubt anyone will.  Still, this is about as good as it gets.

The fact that power is conveyed mostly through still photographs means you're in the presence of a rare talent.  And it does focus on slavery as the cause, for the very good reason that it caused the war: the economic and state sovereignty issues that undergirded the Confederate States of America all sprang from the politics of human servitude.  No slaves, no war.Burns, though, hews very, very closely to the traditional telling of the Civil War as a conflict that occurred mainly in Virginia, with some other, minor battles in Tennessee and Mississippi.  The western campaigns matter only when Sherman comes on the stage, and for Burns they matter because Sherman is there.  Historians abandoned this approach three decades before ""The Civil War"" debuted, and today it looks even more archaic.Is this so bad?  I think it is.  It's a peculiarly myopic view,  which ""Lost Cause"" historians happily parroted in the 20s and 30s: the gallant and brilliant Southerners, fighting north of Richmond, held off the stubborn and brutal Yankees until the most brutal Yankee (Grant) put down the flower of chivalry with unapologetic, disgraceful butchery.  It gives Robert E. Lee a genius out of proportion to his abilities and downplays the military revolution in the Union Army, arguably the first fighting force of the modern era.The Union's superb organizational techniques came to the fore in the Western theater, where generals like Grant, Sherman and George Thomas, out of the Virginia spotlight, were free to operate, and had much more success.  With the exception of the Vicksburg campaign, Burns fails to convey this: he ignores the Army of Tennesee's invasion of Kentucky, he skips over the Tennesee campaigns (leaving Thomas, the war's best defensive general, a footnote in the process) and never adequately conveys the strategic manuevering of Sherman and Johnston north of Atlanta in the spring of 1864.So, will anyone besides a Civil War geek like me complain?  Probably not.  If Burns' documentary was all tactics, it wouldn't be as powerful.  But his approach here was repeated in ""Baseball"" and ""Jazz"": take a handful of colorful personalities to tell the story and trust them to tell it fully and completely.  As critics have noted, this translates into one field or one idea getting the face time, at the expense of others.  In ""Baseball,"" the 50s are almost exclusively devoted to the Yankees, Dodgers and Giants, as if baseball did not exist outside the Big Apple; in ""Jazz,"" Wynton Marsalis, a neo-traditionalist, gets to tell his version of Jazz, one reason the form's last 40 years get so little treatment.So it is with ""The Civil War:"" it's all about Virginia and the east.  Why?  Because Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is more telegenic than William Rosecrans, and his story had a happier ending.  For a story-teller, it makes sense.  For a historian, using one man or one woman to stand in place of an entire era limits our understanding of the time.  Burns, unfortunately, lets his narrative get in the way of the history.  And he would do it again and again.",3,"Moving, but foreshadows Burns' later shortcomings",1056499200,"06 25, 2003",2003,3173,"['Everyone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'power', 'film', 'give', 'emotional', 'left', 'hook', 'fact', 'power', 'conveyed', 'mostly', 'still', 'photographs', ""'re"", 'presence', 'rare', 'talent', 'focus', 'slavery', 'cause', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'caused', 'war', 'economic', 'state', 'sovereignty', 'issues', 'undergirded', 'Confederate', 'States', 'America', 'sprang', 'politics', 'human', 'servitude', 'slaves', 'war.Burns', 'though', 'very', 'very', 'closely', 'traditional', 'telling', 'Civil', 'War', 'conflict', 'occurred', 'mainly', 'Virginia', 'other', 'minor', 'battles', 'Tennessee', 'Mississippi', 'western', 'campaigns', 'matter', 'only', 'when', 'Sherman', 'stage', 'Burns', 'matter', 'Sherman', 'there', 'Historians', 'abandoned', 'approach', 'three', 'decades', 'Civil', 'War', 'debuted', 'today', 'even', 'more', 'archaic.Is', 'so', 'bad', 'think', 'peculiarly', 'myopic', 'view', 'Lost', 'Cause', 'historians', 'happily', 'parroted', '20s', '30s', 'gallant', 'brilliant', 'Southerners', 'fighting', 'north', 'Richmond', 'held', 'off', 'stubborn', 'brutal', 'Yankees', 'most', 'brutal', 'Yankee', 'Grant', 'put', 'down', 'flower', 'chivalry', 'unapologetic', 'disgraceful', 'butchery', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'genius', 'proportion', 'abilities', 'military', 'revolution', 'Union', 'Army', 'arguably', 'first', 'fighting', 'force', 'modern', 'era.The', 'Union', 'superb', 'organizational', 'techniques', 'came', 'fore', 'Western', 'theater', 'where', 'generals', 'Grant', 'Sherman', 'George', 'Thomas', 'Virginia', 'spotlight', 'were', 'free', 'operate', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'success', 'exception', 'Vicksburg', 'campaign', 'Burns', 'convey', 'Army', 'Tennesee', 'invasion', 'Kentucky', 'Tennesee', 'campaigns', 'leaving', 'Thomas', 'war', 'best', 'defensive', 'general', 'footnote', 'process', 'never', 'adequately', 'conveys', 'strategic', 'manuevering', 'Sherman', 'Johnston', 'north', 'Atlanta', 'spring', '1864.So', 'will', 'anyone', 'besides', 'Civil', 'War', 'geek', 'complain', 'Probably', 'not', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'was', 'tactics', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'powerful', 'approach', 'here', 'was', 'repeated', 'Baseball', 'Jazz', 'take', 'handful', 'colorful', 'personalities', 'tell', 'story', 'trust', 'tell', 'fully', 'completely', 'critics', 'have', 'noted', 'one', 'field', 'one', 'idea', 'getting', 'face', 'time', 'expense', 'others', 'Baseball', '50s', 'are', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'devoted', 'Yankees', 'Dodgers', 'Giants', 'baseball', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'Big', 'Apple', 'Jazz', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'neo-traditionalist', 'tell', 'version', 'Jazz', 'one', 'reason', 'form', 'last', '40', 'years', 'get', 'so', 'little', 'treatment.So', 'Civil', 'War', 'Virginia', 'east', 'Why', 'Joshua', 'Lawrence', 'Chamberlain', 'more', 'telegenic', 'William', 'Rosecrans', 'story', 'had', 'happier', 'ending', 'story-teller', 'sense', 'historian', 'using', 'one', 'man', 'one', 'woman', 'stand', 'place', 'entire', 'era', 'understanding', 'time', 'Burns', 'unfortunately', 'narrative', 'get', 'way', 'history', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'again']",N/A
289465,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6301996135,Charles Ashbacher,"[24, 26]","As a child of the public school system of the United States and with children now in school, I can accurately state that the real history of the American civil war is not being taught. In general, students are told that it was largely about slavery and the rights of blacks. Nothing could be further from the truth. The abolitionist movement was rather small and some of the antiwar riots that took place in the North were due largely to the resentment of men who did not want to fight and die for the blacks. This and many other misconceptions are set straight in this film series.The causes and consequences of the war are presented in great detail, with an emphasis on historical accuracy. Even almost fifteen decades later, it is sad to watch the first episode and the events leading to the states seceding from the union. It is amazing to realize that there was still strong sentiment in most states for staying in the union. It is overstating to stay that the majority was pro-union, but it is accurate to say that the majority of white people in the Confederate States were not in favor of seceding in 1861.In the beginning very few thought the war would last more than a few months, and there were some who thought that it would end with a peaceful political settlement. William Tecumseh Sherman was considered unfit for duty when he stated that it would be a long and bloody fight. As the events unfold, one cannot help but draw comparisons with the events in Europe in August 1914. As the armies of Europe marched off to war waved on by cheering crowds, no one thought that it would end four years later with one side totally destroyed after horrendous slaughter.The civil war was the first war where massive citizen armies numbering in the hundreds of thousands clashed. In this tape you see scenes that could pass for what happened fifty years later in the fields of northwest France. Extensive fortifications of trenchworks, reinforced by barricades and stretching for miles. Dead men are left strewn across fields after leaving their fortifications to attack the enemy in their trenches. It amazes me to think that the Europeans repeated the American experience in world war one, somehow still believing that courage was strong enough to defeat armed men behind barricades.The course of the war leads many different ways, but most often union defeats at the hands of dashing, talented Confederate military leaders. George McClelland has to go down as the greatest example of arrogant ineptitude in American history. Had he acted with anything approaching the dash of Lee, the war could have been ended in the first year. So many things went wrong, and yet in the end, as long as no other country intervened, a union victory was assured.The conclusion put forward in the final tape is a bit overstated, but it is accurate. Before the war, the United States was a political entity where the emphasis was on the states. After the war was over, the emphasis was on the united, as it was the single event that forged a nation. No longer was a person first and foremost a Virginian or a Texan, forever more they would be an American from Texas or an American from Virginia.Despite years of reading about the civil war, I still learned many aspects of the war from this tape, The producers have created a documentary masterpiece that should be required viewing of all citizens, current and potential.",5,Superb film about the event that made America a nation,1024617600,"06 21, 2002",2002,3407,"['child', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'United', 'States', 'children', 'now', 'school', 'can', 'accurately', 'state', 'real', 'history', 'American', 'civil', 'war', 'not', 'being', 'taught', 'general', 'students', 'are', 'told', 'was', 'largely', 'slavery', 'rights', 'blacks', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'abolitionist', 'movement', 'was', 'rather', 'small', 'antiwar', 'riots', 'took', 'place', 'North', 'were', 'due', 'largely', 'resentment', 'men', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'fight', 'die', 'blacks', 'many', 'other', 'misconceptions', 'are', 'set', 'straight', 'film', 'series.The', 'causes', 'consequences', 'war', 'are', 'presented', 'great', 'detail', 'emphasis', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Even', 'almost', 'fifteen', 'decades', 'later', 'sad', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'events', 'leading', 'states', 'seceding', 'union', 'amazing', 'realize', 'was', 'still', 'strong', 'sentiment', 'most', 'states', 'staying', 'union', 'overstating', 'stay', 'majority', 'was', 'pro-union', 'accurate', 'say', 'majority', 'white', 'people', 'Confederate', 'States', 'were', 'not', 'favor', 'seceding', '1861.In', 'beginning', 'very', 'few', 'thought', 'war', 'would', 'last', 'more', 'few', 'months', 'were', 'who', 'thought', 'would', 'end', 'peaceful', 'political', 'settlement', 'William', 'Tecumseh', 'Sherman', 'was', 'considered', 'unfit', 'duty', 'when', 'stated', 'would', 'be', 'long', 'bloody', 'fight', 'events', 'unfold', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'events', 'Europe', 'August', '1914', 'armies', 'Europe', 'marched', 'war', 'waved', 'cheering', 'crowds', 'one', 'thought', 'would', 'end', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'side', 'totally', 'destroyed', 'horrendous', 'slaughter.The', 'civil', 'war', 'was', 'first', 'war', 'where', 'massive', 'citizen', 'armies', 'numbering', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'clashed', 'tape', 'see', 'scenes', 'could', 'pass', 'what', 'happened', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'fields', 'northwest', 'France', 'Extensive', 'fortifications', 'trenchworks', 'reinforced', 'barricades', 'stretching', 'miles', 'Dead', 'men', 'are', 'left', 'strewn', 'fields', 'leaving', 'fortifications', 'attack', 'enemy', 'trenches', 'think', 'Europeans', 'repeated', 'American', 'experience', 'world', 'war', 'one', 'somehow', 'still', 'believing', 'courage', 'was', 'strong', 'enough', 'defeat', 'armed', 'men', 'barricades.The', 'course', 'war', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'most', 'often', 'union', 'defeats', 'hands', 'dashing', 'talented', 'Confederate', 'military', 'leaders', 'George', 'McClelland', 'go', 'down', 'greatest', 'example', 'arrogant', 'ineptitude', 'American', 'history', 'Had', 'acted', 'anything', 'approaching', 'dash', 'Lee', 'war', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ended', 'first', 'year', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'went', 'wrong', 'yet', 'end', 'as', 'long', 'other', 'country', 'intervened', 'union', 'victory', 'was', 'assured.The', 'conclusion', 'put', 'forward', 'final', 'tape', 'bit', 'overstated', 'accurate', 'war', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'political', 'entity', 'where', 'emphasis', 'was', 'states', 'war', 'was', 'over', 'emphasis', 'was', 'united', 'was', 'single', 'event', 'forged', 'nation', 'No', 'longer', 'was', 'person', 'first', 'foremost', 'Virginian', 'Texan', 'forever', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'American', 'Texas', 'American', 'Virginia.Despite', 'years', 'reading', 'civil', 'war', 'still', 'learned', 'many', 'aspects', 'war', 'tape', 'producers', 'have', 'created', 'documentary', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'citizens', 'current', 'potential']",N/A

289469,AA21JFN2TKVCN,6301996135,Chris Johnson,"[43, 69]","This is as good a documentary as anyone has ever made.  It is beautifully photographed and very dramatic.  Its voiceover actors are almost perfect for their roles and its talking heads, particularly Shelby Foote, are interesting and informative, coming in at just the right time.  Even though there isn't a battle recreation here, I got more of a feel of what the battles must have been like watching this than from any other Civil War documentary I've ever seen.  The subjects covered here are rather cliched; one would like to heard much more about things like the inner wars in east Tennessee and Missouri or the New York draft riots.  But this is still the best Civil War documentary available.Which isn't the compliment you'd think.  Because if you want to understand why the war happened, you won't find that out here.  Burns dedicates about half of one episode to the causes of the war, nowhere near enough time.  It took Allan Nevins 2,000 pages to get from 1848 to 1861.  Entire books have been written on the causes of the war, a topic Burns barely discusses.  There is next-to nothing here about the split in the Democratic party in the 1840's, the political controversy over Oregon and Texas, the battles over internal improvements which alienated the West, or even the Kansas- Nebraska Act, which led to the formation of the Republican Party.Burns' Civil War just kind of begins.

289472,A18YMFFJW974QS,6301996135,CKE,"[6, 6]","Praise for Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" is truly endless. However, I have a story that I think will prove the greatness of ""The Civil War."" Recently, I was stuck grounded on a plane. A powerful thunderstorm caused the closing of the entire airport, and due to the lightning we were unable to leave the plane. We were stuck. It had been a very long week and I was very anxious to get home to my family so adding additional time on a sweltering plane was the last thing I wanted. I then remembered that I had myPhilips DCP851 8.5-Inch Portable DVD Player with Ipod Dockand the series ""The Civil War"" with me on the plane. The next thing I realize it was 2 1/2 hours later and I was annoyed by a tapping on my shoulder as flight attendant told me that I had to stow my electronics so that we could prepare to take off. I was annoyed.... I was so enamored by this min-series that I lost track of time and I had forgotten that I was sitting on a plane just outside of my gate (and no, I was not sitting in first class!). As we were taking off I realized that I had never watched ANYTHING that would have distracted me to that degree.What makes ""The Civil War"" such a mesmerizing experience? It really is almost too much to list, but I will try anyway.- The narration of David McCullough. It is amazing (to me) that such a talented Pulitzer Prized author could have a second career that may be better than his first! McCullough's voice is perfectly toned and adds both passion and knowledge to the narration. It is very clear that he is not simply reading from a script - this is a rare instance when the narrator has a deep and personal knowledge of the subject matter.- Shelby Foote.... Shelby Foote .... Shelby Foote ( author ofThe Civil War: A Narrative (3 Vol. Set). I can't imagine ""The Civil War"" without the commentary provided by Shelby Foote. It is like trying to imagine your right shoe without the left - it may look ok, but it just wouldn't work. Shelby Foote and his Mississippi draw was something to look forward to within the series. His commentary was not only insightful but it offered a sense of reality that is unmatched in other documentaries. It reminds me of listening to stories from a favorite uncle - one that had first-hand experience in the events and a flair for story-telling that keeps you on the edge-of-your-seat. Shelby Foote makes the entire mini-series feel personal and intimate. I could go on for days about his contribution to this documentary.- The soundtrack - The songAshokan Farewell: From ""The Civil War"" (Intermediate String Orchestra)is an inspired choice to be used as the underpinning of the story. Ashokan Farewell is truly haunting and emphasizes the melancholy of the entire series. While ""Ashokan Farewell"" may be the star of the soundtrack it certainly does not stand alone for its contribution. Again, Ken Burns is able to use music to weave together the narration, pictures, and the commentary to make a tight and engaging story.- The pictures and the use of ""The Ken Burns Effect"" - I guess by now this is to be expected by Ken Burns documentaries, but again in ""The Civil War"" it adds a stark realism about the people who participated and died in the conflict.- The story is balanced in a way that no one will agree 100% with the interpetation. For example, in the special features Shelby Foote admits that he feels that Burns focused too much on slavery. However, Shelby Foote has a southern bias so it is to be expected that he was not completely comfortable with that aspect of the documentary.Final Verdict - Should be required viewing by all Americans.

289474,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6301996135,C. O. DeRiemer,"[498, 512]","There aren't too many productions from television that one can call ""noble,"" but Ken Burns' The Civil War qualifies. Burns uses photographs, music, speech, maps and historical context to tell the story of the second most formative event in the nation's history. And since in those days people wrote...diaries, letters, journals...there is the written record not just of the great leaders, the politicians and generals, but of the wives and sweethearts, the nurses and doctors, newspaper editors and farmers. Most of all there are the words of the soldiers. Burns shows the importance and the sweep of the war, but in part he does it through the lives of average people caught up in events they may not have completely comprehended, but which they believed in.If the words themselves have power, so do the voices. Burns recruited great voices, some actors, some not, to speak the words, distinctive voices that give great resonance to what we see. Julie Harris as Mary Chestnut, Charlie McDowell, a Virginia reporter, as Sam Watkins, Arthur Miller as William Sherman, Jason Robards as Grant, Studs Terkel as Benjamin Butler, Sam Waterston as Lincoln, and many others. He has David McCullough as the narrator. McCullough, an outstanding historian and writer, does a wonderful job. Burns also uses a number of historians to underline key points. Foremost, in my view, is Shelby Foote. Foote is the author of the epic three-volume Civil War. With his Southern accent, common sense and soft irony, he's a fascinating raconteur.The program is never dry or dull. It is gripping and emotional. Both sides felt they were fighting for a pure cause. What is particularly touching is that, as a people, we had not yet lost much of the capacity for simple, unadorned, unembarrassed feelings, whether it be patriotism for one's country or love for one's wife. I challenge anyone to read this letter from Sullivan Ballou, a 32-year-old soldier in the Union Army, to his 24-year-old wife, and not sit stunned with emotion. Ballou was killed in the first battle of Bull Run a week later.July 14, 1861Camp Clark, WashingtonMy very dear Sarah:The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days-perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more . . .I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans on the triumph of the Government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and sufferings of the Revolution. And I am willing-perfectly willing-to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt . . .Sarah my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly on with all these chains to the battle field.The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them for so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and seen our sons grown up to honorable manhood, around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me-perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar, that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battle field, it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often times been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness . . .But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights . . . always, always, and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath, as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again . . .--------------The program flows over 11 hours on five discs.

289476,A16DMCKV9RMQGI,6301996135,"Continental Op ""philmarlowe39""","[2, 2]","Ken Burns' eleven-hour epic brilliantly captures the tragedy of the American Civil War through folksy historians, celebrity voice-overs, searing photography, and the eloquent letters and diaries of everyday soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict.It has been said often enough that to truly understand the American spirit, one must study the U.S. Civil War.  In a four-year microcosm, the war summed up all the best in the United States.  Namely, the abolition of race-based chattel slavery, the vindication of democracy in a republican form of goverment in an era dominated by European monarchs, the incredible bravery of the Union and Confederate soldiers, and the sheer political and intellectual brilliance of men like Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.  Likewise, the war also displayed some of America's worst characteristics:  the vicious 1863 Draft Riots in New York City, the draft exemptions for the rich--both North and South, the 1864 massacre of 300 black Union soldiers by the Confederate army (and Robert E. Lee's refusal to stop similar racist carnage in the future), and Sherman's brutal campaign against civilians in Georgia and South Carolina.In eleven, sprawling hours, Burns and writer Geoffrey C. Ward capture the essence of the war and of the American spirit, and how the war united the country, but yet still divides it.  This is no small feat, and Burns' documentary is truly magnificent.That being said, Burns focuses just a little too much on slavery being the cause of the war (it wasn't).  The real cause was federal power versus state power.  Simply put, the South didn't think the North had any right to tell it what to do--and was convinced that the federal government was a stooge for Northern interests.  If you don't believe me, look to the fact that the U.S. nearly had a civil war over tariffs in the 1830s.  Ken Burns conveniently didn't put THAT in his documentary, but liberty and human freedom undoubtedly make a more compelling story than how much in tax you can charge to imported goods from France.  However, in all fairness, slavery (as well as Lincoln's election in 1860) was the straw the broke the camel's back (so to speak) and it was the preeminent moral and political issue of the mid-19th Century in America.The DVD extras are somewhat insightful.  Ken Burns himself comes across as a stale personality and isn't very interesting.  George Will calls the war ""the greatest war in history"".  Not true, I think the Persian Wars, Punic Wars, 30 Years War, Napoleonic Wars and World Wars I and II all outrank our civil war, but it's interesting fuel for debate.  The best interview is Stanley Crouch of the ""New York Daily News"" who gives a very candid view on the war and why Robert E. Lee is ""overrated"".",5,The definitive U.S. Civil War documentary,1038009600,"11 23, 2002",2002,2771,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'eleven-hour', 'epic', 'brilliantly', 'tragedy', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'folksy', 'historians', 'celebrity', 'voice-overs', 'searing', 'photography', 'eloquent', 'letters', 'diaries', 'everyday', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'sides', 'conflict.It', 'been', 'said', 'often', 'enough', 'truly', 'understand', 'American', 'spirit', 'one', 'must', 'study', 'U.S.', 'Civil', 'War', 'four-year', 'microcosm', 'war', 'summed', 'up', 'best', 'United', 'States', 'Namely', 'abolition', 'race-based', 'chattel', 'slavery', 'vindication', 'democracy', 'republican', 'form', 'goverment', 'era', 'dominated', 'European', 'monarchs', 'incredible', 'bravery', 'Union', 'Confederate', 'soldiers', 'sheer', 'political', 'intellectual', 'brilliance', 'men', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Frederick', 'Douglass', 'Likewise', 'war', 'also', 'displayed', 'America', 'worst', 'characteristics', 'vicious', '1863', 'Draft', 'Riots', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'draft', 'exemptions', 'rich', 'North', 'South', '1864', 'massacre', '300', 'black', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'Confederate', 'army', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'refusal', 'stop', 'similar', 'racist', 'carnage', 'future', 'Sherman', 'brutal', 'campaign', 'civilians', 'Georgia', 'South', 'Carolina.In', 'eleven', 'sprawling', 'hours', 'Burns', 'writer', 'Geoffrey', 'C.', 'Ward', 'capture', 'essence', 'war', 'American', 'spirit', 'how', 'war', 'united', 'country', 'yet', 'still', 'small', 'feat', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'truly', 'magnificent.That', 'being', 'said', 'Burns', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'slavery', 'being', 'cause', 'war', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'cause', 'was', 'federal', 'power', 'versus', 'state', 'power', 'Simply', 'put', 'South', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'North', 'had', 'right', 'tell', 'do', 'was', 'convinced', 'federal', 'government', 'was', 'stooge', 'Northern', 'interests', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'look', 'fact', 'U.S.', 'nearly', 'had', 'civil', 'war', 'tariffs', '1830s', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'conveniently', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'THAT', 'documentary', 'liberty', 'human', 'freedom', 'undoubtedly', 'make', 'more', 'compelling', 'story', 'how', 'much', 'tax', 'can', 'charge', 'imported', 'goods', 'France', 'However', 'fairness', 'slavery', 'as', 'well', 'Lincoln', 'election', '1860', 'was', 'straw', 'broke', 'camel', 'back', 'so', 'speak', 'was', 'preeminent', 'moral', 'political', 'issue', 'mid-19th', 'Century', 'America.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'somewhat', 'insightful', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'across', 'stale', 'personality', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'George', 'Will', 'war', 'greatest', 'war', 'history', 'Not', 'true', 'think', 'Persian', 'Wars', 'Punic', 'Wars', '30', 'Years', 'War', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'World', 'Wars', 'II', 'outrank', 'civil', 'war', 'interesting', 'fuel', 'debate', 'best', 'interview', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'New', 'York', 'Daily', 'News', 'who', 'very', 'candid', 'view', 'war', 'why', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'overrated']",N/A

Is this series going to satisfy experts on the War?  No.  Is it comprehensive?  No, again.  But it is certainly more information than they get in their general history books at school.This series captured the public imagination for a lot of good reasons.  The use of contemporary photographs is done very effectively and lets most people see images of the War they had never seen before.  Hearing Shelby Foote and many other fine historians talk about the War is also interesting and informative.  Yes, it would be better to read the million words of Foote's narrative of the War and dozens of other books.  However, I doubt you will get most kids to do that and an effective mini-series like this could spark their interest to dig deeper.For all its limitations and simplifications of important issues, this is a terrific series and deserves to be in every home that has at least some interest in American history.

The civil war is so much more. Burns focuses primarily on the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia, while in reality the war was won in the west. Battles of the east were the biggest in terms of numbers but the battles in the west, discussed but practically ignored, were more important. Ft. Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, and Atlanta are in there, but not given their proper due. Not a word is said about battles west of the Mississippi, the complicated issues of European involvement are ignored, the importance of blockade-running dismmissed, technological advanced glossed over, anti-war movements in North and South forgotten, and the causes of the war are treated with all the complexity of a fourth grade book report.

The different strategies employed by both sides, the prisoner of war camps and the mistreatment of the prisoners on both sides. The Emancipation Proclamation and it's effects. The plight of the just freed slaves leaving the south and thinking everything was going to be all hunky dory when they made it across the Mason Dixon line, and finding out that the people of the north didn't really want them up there with them. They just wanted them freed from southern slave holders and expected them to stay in the south to make their living. Racism of course reared it's ugly head when Democrats, in the south mainly, started the KKK after the war and started killing republicans, both black and white. The story of the Civil War, and its ramifications, cannot be told in a mere hour and forty minutes. This just shows Ken Burn's view on slavery back in Civil War times.

Using actors to read actual letters and  quoting dialog from the war's participants, while showing the viewer  startling photographs from the war, was a brilliant stroke.  And the  commentaries sprinkled throughout by the historians, especially Foote,  gleaned an insight not often found in documentary films, and brought  vividly to life the great battles and the terrible human cost that the  people of the era (both male and female / north and south) had  suffered.If one wants to see how our nation grew up and is the country  we have today, look no further than this epic as a starting point.  I would  also recommend the four-hour movie ""Gettysburg"", taken almost word-for-word  from the late Michael Shaara's pulitzer prize novel ""The Killer Angels"", as  a fine companion piece.""The Civil War"" documentary (nine video  tapes--approximately 15 hours of viewing time) is a fine beginning for  anyone thirsting for knowledge about our history.  Those interested in the  ""Old West"" may also get an insight, or at least an understanding, of where  some of the most notorious outlaws and lawmen sprang, and possibly why they  felt human life was so dirt-cheap.Between 1 and 10, ""The Civil War""  rates the highest level possible.  If films like these were available when  I was going to school, maybe I wouldn't have napped so often in history  class.",5,A must for anyone&#65533;s video collection.,957830400,"05 9, 2000",2000,1740,"['could', 'kick', 'not', 'recording', 'PBS', 'special', 'when', 'aired', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Luckily', 'was', 'able', 'purchase', 'magnificent', 'documentary', 'can', 'tell', 'well', 'steep', 'purchase', 'price.Ken', 'Burns', 'artistic', 'creation', 'be', 'standard', 'other', 'documentary', 'films', 'are', 'judged', 'was', 'landmark', 'film', 'disecting', 'very', 'complex', 'subject', 'Using', 'actors', 'read', 'actual', 'letters', 'quoting', 'dialog', 'war', 'participants', 'showing', 'viewer', 'startling', 'photographs', 'war', 'was', 'brilliant', 'stroke', 'commentaries', 'sprinkled', 'historians', 'especially', 'Foote', 'gleaned', 'insight', 'not', 'often', 'found', 'documentary', 'films', 'brought', 'vividly', 'life', 'great', 'battles', 'terrible', 'human', 'cost', 'people', 'era', 'male', 'female', '/', 'north', 'south', 'had', 'suffered.If', 'one', 'see', 'how', 'nation', 'grew', 'up', 'country', 'have', 'today', 'look', 'further', 'epic', 'starting', 'point', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'four-hour', 'movie', 'Gettysburg', 'taken', 'almost', 'word-for-word', 'late', 'Michael', 'Shaara', 'pulitzer', 'prize', 'novel', 'Killer', 'Angels', 'fine', 'companion', 'piece', 'Civil', 'War', 'documentary', 'nine', 'video', 'tapes', 'approximately', '15', 'hours', 'viewing', 'time', 'fine', 'beginning', 'anyone', 'thirsting', 'knowledge', 'history', 'interested', 'Old', 'West', 'may', 'also', 'get', 'insight', 'least', 'understanding', 'where', 'most', 'notorious', 'outlaws', 'lawmen', 'sprang', 'possibly', 'why', 'felt', 'human', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'dirt-cheap.Between', '1', '10', 'Civil', 'War', 'rates', 'highest', 'level', 'possible', 'films', 'were', 'available', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'school', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'napped', 'so', 'often', 'history', 'class']",N/A
289499,A2TXR85WQLE32N,6301996135,D. S. Thurlow,"[3, 3]","Ken Burns' absolutely superb documentary ""The Civil War"" may have been public television's finest broadcasting hours, now available in a DVD set.  Burns' unique mixture of photographs, period music, interviews with various historians, voiceover narrative by David McCullough, and excerpts from period letters and speeches creates a spell-binding effect for the viewer, whether dedicated student of history or general viewer.Burns takes the war chronologically, as a festering debate over the future of slavery becomes a civil war between the American states and a total war for the future of the country.  Although the series covers the fighting from Fort Sumpter to Appomattox, it is less a battle history than the story of nation undergoing a primal shaping event.  In Burns' hands, this catastrophic event becomes almost a lyrical epic poem, touching everything from high strategy to the impact of war on individual homes North and South.  A particular highlight is the commentary by Civil War historian Shelby Foote, whose wry observations provide perspective on the war.  Extra features in the DVD set detail the making of the documentary, along with some additional commentary.  Originally broadcast in 1990, the content of the documentary generally holds up pretty well.This DVD set is very highly recommended as superb entertainment and education.",5,Public Television's Finest Hours....,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,1355,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'documentary', 'Civil', 'War', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'public', 'television', 'finest', 'broadcasting', 'hours', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'set', 'Burns', 'unique', 'mixture', 'photographs', 'period', 'music', 'interviews', 'various', 'historians', 'voiceover', 'narrative', 'David', 'McCullough', 'excerpts', 'period', 'letters', 'speeches', 'spell-binding', 'effect', 'viewer', 'dedicated', 'student', 'history', 'general', 'viewer.Burns', 'war', 'chronologically', 'festering', 'debate', 'future', 'slavery', 'civil', 'war', 'American', 'states', 'total', 'war', 'future', 'country', 'series', 'fighting', 'Fort', 'Sumpter', 'Appomattox', 'less', 'battle', 'history', 'story', 'nation', 'undergoing', 'primal', 'shaping', 'event', 'Burns', 'hands', 'catastrophic', 'event', 'almost', 'lyrical', 'epic', 'poem', 'touching', 'everything', 'high', 'strategy', 'impact', 'war', 'individual', 'homes', 'North', 'South', 'particular', 'highlight', 'commentary', 'Civil', 'War', 'historian', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'wry', 'observations', 'provide', 'perspective', 'war', 'Extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'set', 'detail', 'making', 'documentary', 'additional', 'commentary', 'Originally', 'broadcast', '1990', 'content', 'documentary', 'generally', 'up', 'pretty', 'well.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'superb', 'entertainment', 'education']",N/A

289501,A6WYLA5ZTMFCR,6301996135,Eagle Eye,"[17, 19]","This documentary emphasizes why America's Civil War was also its most significant: it was a war of national self-definition.  We were fighting to define who we were and who we would be.The devastation of the war, with 600,000 Americans dead, the use of repeating guns and ironclad boats, and the Holocaust-like conditions at the Confederacy's ""Andersonville"" POW camp were some of the precursors to the horror of modern warfare.  It was total warfare, extending to civilians as Sherman's brutal march to the sea made clear.One weakness of this production is that it does not make the causes of the war explicit enough, and make clear that slavery on its own did not cause the war.  Abraham Lincoln himself had said at the beginning that if he could preserve the Union and free no slaves, he would do it.  Robert E. Lee did not support the institution of slavery, though he believed that whites were a superior race.  At the beginning, slavery was more a touchstone to conflict, an issue where deep-seated differences between north and south came to a head.  It was probably inevitable that northern society with its industrial base and ""classless"" society would clash with the agrarian South, which was built on a hierarchy of privilege, with white plantation owners at the top and black slaves and poor whites and the bottom.  With the North's economic progress came southern anxieties about the growth in the federal government's power and what that meant.  Could the federal government override the ability of new states to decide if they were to be free or slave states?  The states that would make up the Confederacy said no.The profiles of the major players in the war, Lincoln, Lee, Grant, McClellan, Sherman, Stonewall Jackson and others, as well as the correspondence of rank and file soldiers, brings out the humanity of the conflict.Its wounds remain.  I once knew a descendent of Robert E. Lee, who carried himself with a sense of honor and grace that seems to have almost completely disappeared from our national life.  He'd get choked up talking about the ""War between the States.""  It is hard to understand how Robert E. Lee, someone of such outstanding character, could allow himself to be so blind to racial injustice.  But that famous Mathew Brady photograph of him standing outside Appomatox Courthouse after the surrender, depicted in this documentary,  shows his noble bearing.  In his own way, Lee depicted those qualities so lacking in our political and social life these days:  duty and honor.This documentary brought home the Civil War's devastation.  It helped me understand more about who we are as Americans.",5,A War to Define Ourselves,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2636,"['documentary', 'why', 'America', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'significant', 'was', 'war', 'national', 'self-definition', 'were', 'fighting', 'define', 'who', 'were', 'who', 'would', 'be.The', 'devastation', 'war', '600,000', 'Americans', 'dead', 'use', 'repeating', 'guns', 'ironclad', 'boats', 'Holocaust-like', 'conditions', 'Confederacy', 'Andersonville', 'POW', 'camp', 'were', 'precursors', 'horror', 'modern', 'warfare', 'was', 'total', 'warfare', 'extending', 'civilians', 'Sherman', 'brutal', 'march', 'sea', 'made', 'clear.One', 'weakness', 'production', 'not', 'make', 'causes', 'war', 'explicit', 'enough', 'make', 'clear', 'slavery', 'own', 'did', 'not', 'cause', 'war', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'said', 'beginning', 'could', 'preserve', 'Union', 'free', 'slaves', 'would', 'do', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'did', 'not', 'support', 'institution', 'slavery', 'believed', 'whites', 'were', 'superior', 'race', 'beginning', 'slavery', 'was', 'more', 'touchstone', 'conflict', 'issue', 'where', 'deep-seated', 'differences', 'north', 'south', 'came', 'head', 'was', 'probably', 'inevitable', 'northern', 'society', 'industrial', 'base', 'classless', 'society', 'would', 'clash', 'agrarian', 'South', 'was', 'built', 'hierarchy', 'privilege', 'white', 'plantation', 'owners', 'top', 'black', 'slaves', 'poor', 'whites', 'bottom', 'North', 'economic', 'progress', 'came', 'southern', 'anxieties', 'growth', 'federal', 'government', 'power', 'what', 'meant', 'Could', 'federal', 'government', 'ability', 'new', 'states', 'decide', 'were', 'be', 'free', 'slave', 'states', 'states', 'would', 'make', 'up', 'Confederacy', 'said', 'no.The', 'profiles', 'major', 'players', 'war', 'Lincoln', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'McClellan', 'Sherman', 'Stonewall', 'Jackson', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'correspondence', 'rank', 'file', 'soldiers', 'out', 'humanity', 'conflict.Its', 'remain', 'once', 'knew', 'descendent', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'who', 'carried', 'sense', 'honor', 'grace', 'have', 'almost', 'completely', 'disappeared', 'national', 'life', ""'d"", 'get', 'choked', 'up', 'talking', 'War', 'States', 'hard', 'understand', 'how', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'someone', 'such', 'outstanding', 'character', 'could', 'allow', 'be', 'so', 'blind', 'racial', 'injustice', 'famous', 'Mathew', 'Brady', 'photograph', 'standing', 'outside', 'Appomatox', 'Courthouse', 'surrender', 'depicted', 'documentary', 'noble', 'bearing', 'own', 'way', 'Lee', 'depicted', 'qualities', 'so', 'lacking', 'political', 'social', 'life', 'days', 'duty', 'honor.This', 'documentary', 'brought', 'Civil', 'War', 'devastation', 'helped', 'understand', 'more', 'who', 'are', 'Americans']",N/A

Pauzer,"[4, 4]","This five DVD series provides a detailed account of the most tragic war in American history, the Civl War which claimed more lives than all of our wars combined. Narrated superbly by David McCullough, who would later narrate the film, ""Seabiscuit,"" the viewer is led through the events before the conflict to fifty years after the Battle of Gettysburg when veterans met again as friends rather than enemies. The last one would die in 1959.  The diaries of soldiers, civilians, and leaders of both sides are reread by such prominent actors as John Waterston, Jason Robards, Julie Harris, Jeremy Irons, Derek Jacobi, George Plimpton, and Morgan Freeman. Actual civil war photographs are interspersed with modern photography of the places where they fell or suffered the misery of bivouac and deprivation. Sounds of musketry, commands and rebel yells often provide background audio that makes the viewer feel as though he or she is there.As the stories are told to us, music of the era provides a background that adds to the realism of the time. It will replay in your ear many times over. ""Dixie"" and ""The Bonnie Blue Flag"" were southern favorites. Another favorite would be written by a lady who suddenly awoke in the middle of the night to pen a poem that would be set to an old Methodist melody. It would become the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic.""Nuance and coincidence are thick and so frequent in this series it is impossible to catalogue all of them here. At the first Battle of Bull Run, Wilmer McClain, a farmer decided his home and family were too close to the war. He would move them into western Virginia where four years later, Robert E. Lee would surrender to Ulysses S. Grant in the parlor of the farmer's new home. ""Dixe"" was written by a Northerner. Union forces named battles after rivers or creeks, while Southerners named them after towns. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a college professor from Maine, found the only way he could be released from his teaching post to fight was to go on sabbatical. As colonel, of the 20th Maine, he would hold and defend the most pivotal position of the battle of Gettysburg, the most important battle of the war, and he understood both at that moment. His regiment of fishermen from Presque Isle ME would face farmers from Talledega, AL.  Drawing a straight line to both communities found Gettysburg on the line, 650 miles apart from each. A failed officer, drunk, and store clerk would end up leading the US Army. His name was Ulysses S. Grant. Robert E. Lee, was offered command of the U.S. Army, but refused. He would not take up arms against his state. A Confederate officer would capture and board a Union vessel where he would cradle a dying Union lieutenant in his arms, his own son. When President Lincoln orders a new cemetery for the fallen, the Quartermaster General, Major General Montgomery Meggs brings it to the front door of Robert E. Lee's home. Within a year his son will be interred in Mrs. Lee's rose garden. It would later be known as Arlington National Cemetery. Two brothers would meet on the battlefield of Gettysburg, one fighting for the South and the other for the North. After the war, the state of Mississippi would spend one fifth of its budget on prothesis for their veterans. Elijah Hunt Rhodes would rise from the rank of private to general and would meet with veterans for years after the war as Major General Chamberlain would. Confederate Nathan Bedford Forrest would also rise from private to general becoming one of the most feared cavalry raiders of the war. His tactics and phrases would become doctrine of the army to this day. ""When surrounded, attack"" or ""Keep up the scare."" Ironclad ships would make their debut and make every navy in the world suddenly obsolete. Abraham Lincoln would be invited to say a ""few appropriate remarks"" at the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery on November 19, 1863. His two minutes of 272 words would forever be remembered as ""Lincoln's Gettysburg Address,"" and it would become the most memorable in American history. The two-hour long speech of 14,000 words by the featured speaker, Senator Edward Everett of Massachusetts would be forgotten. Only his kind telegam to Lincoln, a day later would be remembered, ""I would like to flatter myself that I came to the central point in two hours as you did in two minutes."" In the greatest irony of all, the rebellious Confederacy would have rampant inflation making the U.S. gold dollar, the most valuable currency they could possess.What makes this documentary  so effective is that doesn't look or sound like one. Ken Burns has proven to be a master at this. He has shown how our civil war has had such a profound effect on the American pysche. ""Ashikan Farewell"" written in 1963 in upstate New York, is frequently played throughout the story. It has become a favorite at weddings, anniversaries and funerals across America, and is forever linked indelibly to this story. The sounds of commands, horses, and musketfire add to the realism of this production. Historians Shelby Foote, Edwin Bearss, Barbara Fields, Stephen B. Oates, and James Symington, a former congressman bring to life untold personal accounts of those long dead so well, you think they had been there. The true power of a DVD of this stature is that it makes you think and want to learn more. It's power is that you may never tire of watching it.The actual Civil War defined a nation for people from the North and South, and it continues to this day. Even though it is an event of yesteryear it can no more be separated from us than we could be separated from our own skin. It reveals the resilience and genius of our Constitution. Not a single word is changed because of it.  The United States becomes the first nation to have a civil war over slavery, and the first to have elections during one. Before the war, the United States was described in the plural, are. After the war, it was the ""United States is,"" and it has been ever since.November 11, 2009: For our veterans, North and South, past and present.",5,Moving and Brilliant Beyond Words,1257897600,"11

For those of you who enjoyed his other longies like Baseball, Jazz and New York, or even his 2 parters like Mark Twain, Thomas Jefferson or Lewis and Clark, you will love this. This is the perfect film for History buffs and Non-History buffs alike. There are things that you don't read in the books in this series. For example, I've been to Gettysburg and I've read Mackinlay Kantor's book found in library kid's sections for ages. I know that when General Sickles accidently left Little Round Top unguarded On July 2, 1863, that a young General G.K. Warren saw the situation and called for a division to get into place, and there is a statue on Little Round Top to his memory. What I didn't know was that division was commanded by Maine professor Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and it was his ""unlikely textbook maneuver"" as David McCullough puts it that helped keep the Round Tops from falling into the hands of the Confederates. Whether you're a Civil War buff like me or not, you learn something new every day. This DVD set will be a welcome addition alongside not only my DVD copy of Baseball, but also ""Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided"" which aired on American Experience last year and is also narrated by McCullough. Like Baseball it has a gallery of names doing the voice overs, Sam Waterston, Garrison Keillor, Morgan Freeman, Jason Robards, Julie Christie, Studs Turkel, Charley McDowell and more. UPDATE 10/12/02: I just got my copy this morning. It is time to express my kudos to the manufacturer (for an example of this see my review on The Prisoner Mega Set). Back in 1990 when PBS video first released this series on 9 VHS tapes, the copy of episode 2 was partially cut. After David McCullough's last narration which foreshadows the Battle of Antietam (which will appear in episode 3) on the televised copy, Morgan Freeman gives what I think is the best of his Frederick Douglass voice overs of the entire series. On the pre recorded VHS of Episode 2 that was released in 1990, this last but touching segment of that episode was cut (even though the booklet that came in that slipcase accounts for it). The series was re-released on VHS with help from Turner Home Entertainment in 1994 around the time of the release of Burns' next mega hit ""Baseball"" and re-released again at least once more since, but I do not know of this was rectified at that time (you may email me if you have one of these sets, and you know if it was fixed there). Well I can't speak for the NEW 5 VHS set, but as for the DVDs, justice has been finally served. The missing clips HAVE BEEN RESTORED. So kudos to the folks at Warner Home Video (who co-released the set) and to someone at PBS Video for taking my phone call a few years ago seriously when I mentioned this injustice. After 12 years, Ken Burns epic The Civil War is preserved in a format that will live forever, a set of DVDs you always remember (and watch over and over, like me) about a time our nation can never forget.

However slavery was a cause of the war weather you want to believe that or not.  Also there has been some criticism that Ken Burns only focused on the parts that he would want to focus on well to those people I say make your own documentary.It also makes clever use of several things1.  Photographs thereby putting a face on all of these people.  Too often these civil war documentaries focus to much on the movement of the armies it does not capture the attention or the imagination of the audience as much as a face can.2.

However, as other reviewers havepointed out, political correctness does take its toll.A good example is the way General George McClellan istreated.  Although it is pointed out that he builtthe Union's Army of the Potomac from scratch and thathis men loved him, he is presented by Burns, who oversimplifies the War as being a crusade to ""free the slaves"", as being something of a cross between a traitor and coward for not pushing his clear superiority during the Peninsular Campaign.The way this crucial attempt by the Union to captureRichmond early in the war is portrayed leaves the viewerpuzzled as to why McClennan decided to call off theoffensive in spite of having won several battles.Burns implies that McClennan didn't really believein the cause and was looking for an excuse to backout it.  Further investigation on my part has revealedthat McClennan had very poor information about thestrength and intentions of the enemy and was workingunder immense pressure from the political echelonsback in Washington which interfered in the militarydecision-making process. It is unclear that anyother commander would have had any more success.What is particularly interesting is that historianShelby Foote who appears in the series defends McClennanin his famous history of the Civil War so apparentlyhe didn't have that much input.  The fact is that theUnion wasn't able to really decisively defeat theConfederacy until it found a General, U S Grant, whowas willing to go all the way with a war of attritionand accept high casualties in order to gain victory.On the other hand, obscure aspects of the war arebrought out that are not really dealt with in othersources.  One good example is the series destroysthe myth of the ""united South"" pointing out that therewas tremendous opposition to secession.  Even in a""Deep South"" state like Alabama, only 55% of the populationvoted for secession in a plebescite.  Soldiers from everystate in the Confederacy except South Carolina providedregiments for the Union Army.  It is unfortunate thatinformation about what happened to these SouthernLoyalists after the War is not provided because these Loyalist sentimentsseemed to have been submerged during Reconstruction.It is for these reasons that I would recommend that the viewer use this series as an introduction to the subject, but thenpursue further reading to get a clearer view of thisimmense subject.",4,Worth Seeing-But Keep An Open Mind,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,2578,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'did', 'magnificent', 'job', 'making', 'multi-hourproduction', 'using', 'archival', 'still', 'photography', 'stillmaking', 'interesting', 'viewer', 'backgroundin', 'Civil', 'War', 'However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'havepointed', 'out', 'political', 'correctness', 'take', 'toll.A', 'good', 'example', 'way', 'General', 'George', 'McClellan', 'istreated', 'pointed', 'out', 'Union', 'Army', 'Potomac', 'scratch', 'thathis', 'men', 'loved', 'presented', 'Burns', 'who', 'War', 'being', 'crusade', 'free', 'slaves', 'being', 'something', 'cross', 'traitor', 'coward', 'not', 'pushing', 'clear', 'superiority', 'Peninsular', 'Campaign.The', 'way', 'crucial', 'attempt', 'Union', 'captureRichmond', 'early', 'war', 'portrayed', 'viewerpuzzled', 'why', 'McClennan', 'decided', 'call', 'off', 'theoffensive', 'spite', 'having', 'won', 'several', 'battles.Burns', 'implies', 'McClennan', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'believein', 'cause', 'was', 'looking', 'excuse', 'backout', 'Further', 'investigation', 'part', 'revealedthat', 'McClennan', 'had', 'very', 'poor', 'information', 'thestrength', 'intentions', 'enemy', 'was', 'workingunder', 'immense', 'pressure', 'political', 'echelonsback', 'Washington', 'interfered', 'militarydecision-making', 'process', 'unclear', 'anyother', 'commander', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'success.What', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'historianShelby', 'Foote', 'who', 'series', 'McClennanin', 'famous', 'history', 'Civil', 'War', 'so', 'apparentlyhe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'input', 'fact', 'theUnion', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'really', 'decisively', 'defeat', 'theConfederacy', 'found', 'General', 'U', 'S', 'Grant', 'whowas', 'willing', 'go', 'way', 'war', 'attritionand', 'accept', 'high', 'casualties', 'order', 'gain', 'other', 'hand', 'obscure', 'aspects', 'war', 'arebrought', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'dealt', 'othersources', 'One', 'good', 'example', 'series', 'destroysthe', 'myth', 'united', 'South', 'pointing', 'out', 'therewas', 'tremendous', 'opposition', 'secession', 'Even', 'Deep', 'South', 'state', 'Alabama', 'only', '55', '%', 'populationvoted', 'secession', 'plebescite', 'Soldiers', 'everystate', 'Confederacy', 'South', 'Carolina', 'providedregiments', 'Union', 'Army', 'unfortunate', 'thatinformation', 'what', 'happened', 'SouthernLoyalists', 'War', 'not', 'provided', 'Loyalist', 'sentimentsseemed', 'have', 'been', 'submerged', 'Reconstruction.It', 'reasons', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewer', 'use', 'series', 'introduction', 'subject', 'thenpursue', 'further', 'reading', 'get', 'clearer', 'view', 'thisimmense', 'subject']",N/A

And I don't really feel particularly moved to say anything about this wonderful documentary series apart from the fact that I really liked it.  (So, I guess that would be a ""thumbs up"" from me, then.)  After all, this series originally aired more than two decades ago, has been seen by millions of people, and is now rightly regarded as a national treasure.  What more can I say about it than has already been said by countless others over the years?  It's a brilliant piece of documentary filmmaking.  It manages to be both entertaining and educational throughout.  It is very moving in places.  It really gives you a sense of what the Civil War was like for the soldiers who fought in it, as well as for the noncombatants who lived through it.  It brings the historical figures of the Civil War -- Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, McClellan, Davis, Lee, Jackson, Forrest, Booth, et al. -- to life, showing them as real human beings rather than as icons of legend.  It features the amazing storyteller and Civil War expert, Shelby Foote (1916-2005), who I would gladly listen to for hours on end.  He talked about the war as if he had been there.  Now I want to read everything he ever wrote about the Civil War.  And, last but not least, this documentary series had some really beautiful music -- especially the theme tune for the series, ""Ashokan Farewell"", which I can't get out of my head.  But all of this has been said before, and said better, by others.  I just don't seem to have anything original to add.  I wish I did; but the muse just doesn't seem to be cooperating.

Swift ""97jedi""","[4, 6]","As with most DVDs, I will comment but little on the actual content of the film, but I have to say that even after twenty years, this is still the finest example of filmmaking to have come from PBS if not from any other source as well. More than once in the viewing was I moved to tears at the remembrances of the bravery, the salutes to the fallen, and the grief and triumph of a nation sundered and made whole. Combining period photographs, modern video, and voiceovers with both, Burns provides an overview of the war from the earliest days of Lincoln's political career through the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg when a few dozen survivors gathered together to celebrate their comradeship across the years and the sides.The DVD transfer is exceptional, though the coloring in some of the old photographs is a little incongruous. The voiceover work is also well carried over, being better than the original print. Sam Waterston's voice still does not work as Lincoln, sadly, especially his poor reading of the Gettysburg Address. Morgan Freeman as various black personages, most especially Fredrick Douglas, is the class of the group, with numerous well-known (though some now passed on) luminaries with distinct voices lending their talents. The narration is superb and the interviews with hitorians wonderful.Most lacking, and a terrible oversight with things seemingly being easy to produce in these days, is the lack of subtitles. The hearing impaired would surely appreciate being able to view the program with a text readout of the voiceovers which are the entirety of the film.

The only thing better than knowing that was receiving this set for Christmas.  I was a very good boy last year, and I love Santa.The thing that I've noticed is that these still pictures sometimes wobble ever so slightly.  I never noticed that with the VHS version, because the picture on VHS isn't as great as that of the DVD.  Apparently the camera wiggled just an eyelash' worth from time to time, probably due to movements of the photographer or others in the room at the time.I offer that as an observation, not as a criticism.  I have no regrets having this DVD edition, and highly recommend it to pretty much everyone.I would have appreciated additional material (perhaps a short documentary) about the backlash against the original broadcast, and the responses to that backlash.  If anything, the series bent over backwards to examine the role of slavery as ""the inciting cause"", the role played by women, etc.While I would prefer to have seen a bit more axe-grinding, such as concerning the incompetence of Ambrose Burnside, demonstrated at Fredricksburg, Antietam, Peterborough, and elsewhere, or Robert E Lee's complete lack of major victories (other than Grant's blunder at Cold Harbor) after the death of ""Stonewall"" Jackson, I can't complain about this series.  The script is great, the narrator was the perfect choice, and the various talking heads edify and educate.  The use of hundreds of Civil War era still photos is something that doesn't call attention to itself.  The show is remarkable._The Civil War_ should be enough to induce interest among those (particularly kids) who don't know much about it, or haven't even heard about it, and as far as I'm concerned, this should be shown in every elementary school classroom, bit by bit, in the post-lunch break cool down.  There are any number of books about SNAFUs of the Civil War for those interested in more in depth history.On the one hand there is the ""what if"" ideas seen in some books, particularly regarding lost victories and the like.  Those are often derided by the less plausible ""foregone conclusion"" school who frankly have their heads stuck up their rears.Burns and company in taking the middle way produced the best TV series ever broadcast.

His story made the war real to me, and Ken Burns' documentary brought all of those historical figures to life - as well as the plight of those who suffered during the war.

The thing that strikes me is the commentary by Writer Shelby Foote, absolutely amazing to have such a respected historians own words!  You can just feel for these soldiers and family during this time like it happened yesterday, just so sad to see all the lives lost in this conflict..What was done on this documentary that is different from others is Ken Burns way of taking an absolutely bloody conflict and adding the human side to it, the side that includes real accounts from diary entries and family letters to put a face where one might not have been..You might get the diary entry and an actual picture of the soldier which is so nice to see because sometimes with the old black and white pictures they can speed through it with so many facts that it leaves behind the human feeling that though this was the late 1800's those people did exist and these things did happen..In the end the documentary covered the war so much while putting such emotion into it that you really feel a sadness yet with the words from the past Ken Burns paints a picture for us to see the civil war as truly what it was brother against brother, father against son...A war that you actually had to stand up for what you believe in enough to choose sides and fight against your own but it shows you how really this war had to be fought and why...This is a documentary that needs no re-enactments to hold it's own as the best civil war documentary ever produced..A civil war documentary that needs only words and black and white photographs to tell it's story.. As first stated, throughout the documentary writer Shelby Foote is giving bits of commentary over the whole thing which is another thing that makes this documentary special, to hear such a civil war historian like foote explaining the little known facts about the war made it that much more enjoyable...You find out things about the generals that you might not have known, I've loved learning about the civil war since childhood and I found there were things I never heard before on here maybe it's the neutral balance between north and south...Many documentaries on the civil war carry a northern or a southern bias, never can you find an enjoyable documentary that takes you on such a fascinating ride through history to the time of lincoln and one of our nations great struggles..I wish I had this as a kid, I would have soaked this up so if you have kids interested in the civil war, especially old photos then this is your documentary..Or for the enthusiasts like me that want to add a gem of knowledge to your collection, that adds that spark to you civil war section...To be truthful this to me is the only civil war documentary made today that is worth mentioning!For those of us that are fanatical about the civil war and it's history to the amateur who is just starting to learn, this is truly the most beautiful civil war collection to have..Words cannot describe what this work does to me, I can only state what I know and Hope that you may treasure this as I do",5,"Brilliant!!!

How much do we owe to a documentary about a critical time in American history that's actually enjoyable to watch... and hear?To see even one installment of this series is to get hooked... Period. I remember when it first aired and I watched the first segment. I made the mental note to myself... ""Do NOT miss any of the rest of these!""And thus was I baptized into my love of this glorious piece of work.Upon a considered third viewing, this time being of my own copy, I was struck by the fact that Burns took great pains to get out just exactly why each side felt it was in the right. That was a pretty evenhanded approach in my book and it allows more of the truth of the matter to come out.A side note on the song selected as the theme, ""Ashokan Farewell."" It strikes a beautiful note of sadness and longing which you can relate to being homesick, the loss of a loved one, being separated from one you love. There is a Special Feature dedicated to the writing and use of this song and it made me like it a lot more than I did in the first place. When you hear it, you'll know what I mean.If you're thinking about purchasing this item but the price seems a little daunting, let me reassure you that it is worth whatever is being asked for it. Maybe you could go to your library and check it out a little first. I think if you watch just the first installment, you'll find yourself wanting to expose yourself to more of Mr. Burns' technique as far as a study of the Civil War is concerned and do so deeply enough that you will want to own this DVD set.In school, we didn't spend enough time on the subject of the Civil War to truly understand most of it. The scope is simply too large to be dealt with adequately in a limited timeframe. Here no such error in length occurs. You're steeped in the atmosphere of our nation almost 150 years ago, and because of Burns' careful guidance, you'll come to see an important part of how we, as a nation, came to be where we are today.In my view, it is impossible to recommend this one strongly enough.",5,Almost too good to say anything worthwhile about it,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,2138,"['wonder', 'can', 'say', 'anything', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'marvelous', 'piece', 'work', 'How', 'much', 'do', 'owe', 'documentary', 'critical', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'hear', 'see', 'even', 'one', 'installment', 'series', 'get', 'hooked', 'Period', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'watched', 'first', 'segment', 'made', 'mental', 'note', 'myself', 'Do', 'NOT', 'miss', 'rest', 'thus', 'was', 'baptized', 'love', 'glorious', 'piece', 'work.Upon', 'considered', 'third', 'viewing', 'time', 'being', 'own', 'copy', 'was', 'struck', 'fact', 'Burns', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'get', 'out', 'just', 'exactly', 'why', 'side', 'felt', 'was', 'right', 'was', 'pretty', 'evenhanded', 'approach', 'book', 'more', 'truth', 'matter', 'come', 'out.A', 'side', 'note', 'song', 'selected', 'theme', 'Ashokan', 'Farewell', 'beautiful', 'note', 'sadness', 'longing', 'can', 'relate', 'being', 'homesick', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'being', 'separated', 'one', 'love', 'Special', 'Feature', 'dedicated', 'writing', 'use', 'song', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'did', 'first', 'place', 'When', 'hear', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean.If', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'item', 'price', 'little', 'daunting', 'let', 'reassure', 'worth', 'being', 'asked', 'Maybe', 'could', 'go', 'library', 'check', 'out', 'little', 'first', 'think', 'watch', 'just', 'first', 'installment', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wanting', 'expose', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'technique', 'as', 'far', 'study', 'Civil', 'War', 'concerned', 'do', 'so', 'deeply', 'enough', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'DVD', 'set.In', 'school', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'subject', 'Civil', 'War', 'truly', 'understand', 'most', 'scope', 'simply', 'too', 'large', 'be', 'dealt', 'adequately', 'limited', 'timeframe', 'Here', 'such', 'error', 'length', 'occurs', ""'re"", 'steeped', 'atmosphere', 'nation', 'almost', '150', 'years', 'ago', 'Burns', 'careful', 'guidance', ""'ll"", 'come', 'see', 'important', 'part', 'how', 'nation', 'came', 'be', 'where', 'are', 'today.In', 'view', 'impossible', 'recommend', 'one', 'strongly', 'enough']",N/A

Though it is sketchy in some places, Ken Burns nonetheless performed a masterpiece summarizing in eleven hours a tumultuous period in America's history that went on for at least five years.Burns depicts and highlights the adversities that soldiers and military leaders of both the Union and the Confederacy had to deal with. It was quite interesting to listen to the historians and writers, including Shelby Foote, account how rough the going was for the Union at the start of the Civil War, for the Confederacy had top-notch generals in Robert E. Lee and ""Stonewall"" Jackson who, despite their limited numbers of forces, were equipped with rebel soldiers who, thanks to their hunting and gathering upbringing, were skilled marksmen long before they entered the battlefield; the Union, on the other hand, had, in large part, troops whose backgrounds did not adequately equip them for effective use of weaponry.On a broad scale, recurring themes concerning both sides which include: communication (or lack thereof), coordination, cooperation, strategic revision, and retraining are prevalent throughout. Near the end of the Civil War, however, it seemed to be all about: persistence, will, and reinforcement, all of which were becoming more present in the Union's court.Other noteworthy topics are the number of lives lost in each key battle as well as the toll the casualties had taken on each state's budget. Alarming was the percentage of Mississippi's revenues that ended up being used exclusively for artificial limbs.Despite the focus on the hardships, many of which were accounted for in the vast number of studied notes and letters written to families at the time, Ken Burns' Civil War, nonetheless, does have a lighter side to the subject. Included in this DVD collection are humorous anecdotes recorded by Grant, Lee, Jackson, etc. One such laughable moment was Grant's recollection of how he was not able to familiarize himself with many of the marching tunes that accompanied his forces and how he ended up handling this predicament.All in all, I salute the quality of this work. Ken Burns' Civil War is, by and large, a thorough summary of how hard living was for people back then so that those of us living today could have it so much easier by comparison.

Through photographs, modern footage of the places in question, period music, and voices reading primary source documents of the time, Burns conjures up the conflict in all its thrilling drama, bloody tragedy, dark humor, and stirring nobility. Personal and engaging, this film brought a new awareness of American history to millions of viewers. It should be noted that a huge topic such as the Civil War cannot be entirely crammed into one film, however long; this is necessarily an overview, though an excellent and detailed one. (At least the Civil War had a compact number of years to it; Burns subsequently took on huger topics still such as Baseball and Jazz, with less success. His finite films like this one and ""Lewis and Clark"" are easier to see as a whole.) I have one quibble with this show - I think it oversimplifies the causes of the war. To be specific, it sees only one cause - slavery - and pays no attention to states' rights or economic issues. This is no surprise; his other films have shown us that Burns sees race as the defining issue of our country.

Ken Burns mastery of storytelling using little more than authentic still photography and camera panning and voice overs has given us an 11 hour documentary on the definitive war of our country that has remained unsurpassed for nearly 20 years.The film uses a great deal of authentic photography from the war and excerpts from journals and letters written during the war read by a cast of amazing voice actors who sound so authentic in the language of the day and emotion that you'll swear you were hearing the voices of the real people from beyond the grave. David McCullough lends his voice to the narration of the documentary and does it as well or better than any other narrator I've heard in either film or documentary.The series covers nearly every relevant part of the war from the years leading up to it to the years following it. By using journals and letters written by people from that era it gives you a great insight in to how people saw the war and how it impacted their lives. The series isn't completely analytical so you won't find a step by step analysis of every battle fought, frankly, that would get a little dull anyhow. It does cover the key events of the war and then some though it does leave out a few, most notably the secession of West Virginia from the confederacy which doesn't even get a mention.It's few faults hardly drag it down though as it did so much so well. This series provides an unsurpassed insight in to this great war and really examines the human element to it while still providing a decent tactical analysis as well. It's an amazing piece that manages to provide 11+ hours of interesting footage despite relying on still photos, interviews and voice actors reading material from the period.

We become hooked on this compelling narrative at the end of the first episode, with its unforgettable section on &quot;Honorable Manhood,&quot; which includes the letter written by Major Sullivan Ballou of the 2nd Rhode Island to his wife Sarah back home in Smithfield, a week before the first battle of Manassas. The letter is as emotionally powerful as it is poetic, and once you hear it you will not be surprised that it was included on the CD.  I was also struck by the revelation at the end of the documentary of how the glass plates of photographs taken during the war were sold to greenhouses, where the sun slowly burned away the grim images of death.

289571,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6301996135,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 0]","When this stunning 11 hour documentary was released on PBS in 1990, I remember watching parts of it with awe.  But that was years ago, years before I could easily record episodes on DVR and, frankly, years before my interest in history grew passionate.  That's why I was so delighted with the 5-disc set released in 2004. However, I did find the package a little awkward and it's easy to make a mistake and wind up viewing the same episode twice or missing one altogether, but once these small details are mastered, what is left is the feeling that I have actually lived during those tumultuous times and I now understand how this war has shaped the history of my beloved country, the United States of America.Ken Burns's use of archival photos, interviews with historians, original and traditional music and voice-overs by well-known actors such as Julie Harris, Morgan Freeman and Jason Roberts make this epic haunting, especially since Mr. Burns clearly has a sense of irony and uses it throughout.  However, it is the facts that make this story real, the facts that chill me to the bone.  More then 618,000 people lost their lives in the Civil War.  In the Battle of Gettysburg alone there were 54,112 casualties, including the wounded who often had to have their limbs amputated because guns shot bullets in a spray which literally destroyed bones.The film is divided into nine episodes.  The first describes the history of the causes of the war.  I could feel the tension mounting during this episode because we all knew what was to come.  It was especially sad to see the enthusiasm of the confederates which was so very misplaced.  The second episode brings out how the war to preserve the union became a war to free the slaves.  It also describes the new weapons, such as ironclad ships.  I had heard of ironclad ships before, but now they became real to me, especially with the introduction of diaries of some of the men who actually manned them.  In the third episode the Union forces are suffering defeat but Lincoln still decides to go ahead with the Emancipation Proclamation.  Throughout the series we are constantly learning about the generals on both sides and in the fourth episode we see the combat between Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant.  Throughout, we also feel their humanity.  The interviews with historians, specifically Shelby Foote, really bring this out.  The turning point of the War, the battle of Gettysburg, and the draft riots in New York are depicted in the fifth episode, as well as beginning of the use of Negro troops by the Union forces. There are more battles in the sixth episode, and a description of Lincoln's bid for reelection.  By the seventh episode we see people turning against the war as battles continue to rage.  General Sherman's march to the sea is the highlight of the eighth episode.  Victory seems assured for the Union but the Confederates continue to fight on as the South is being destroyed.  Then, in the ninth episode the war is finally over, but not without a lot of sorrow.  Lincoln has lived to see the end of the war but then his life is ended by assassination.Life goes on.  Years pass.  The soldiers who lived through the War turn into old men, march in parades.  Eventually, we see them no more, and the memory of the war lives on only in history books.  I'm inspired to read more, even explored reading Shelby Foote's 3-volume saga.  But when I looked for it in a bookstore I discovered that each book is 900 dense pages long and I could barely lift each book.  So I guess I'll leave this history for the historians.  That's why I'm so delighted that Ken Burns made this series.  If you want to learn about this definitive period of history, this classic Ken Burns work is the way to go.  I give it my highest recommendation.",5,"As this haunting epic unfolded, I felt I was living through the Civil War.",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,3798,"['When', 'stunning', '11', 'hour', 'documentary', 'was', 'released', 'PBS', '1990', 'remember', 'watching', 'parts', 'awe', 'was', 'years', 'ago', 'years', 'could', 'easily', 'record', 'episodes', 'DVR', 'frankly', 'years', 'interest', 'history', 'grew', 'passionate', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'delighted', '5-disc', 'set', 'released', '2004', 'However', 'did', 'find', 'package', 'little', 'awkward', 'easy', 'make', 'mistake', 'wind', 'up', 'viewing', 'same', 'episode', 'twice', 'missing', 'one', 'altogether', 'once', 'small', 'details', 'are', 'mastered', 'what', 'left', 'feeling', 'have', 'actually', 'lived', 'tumultuous', 'times', 'now', 'understand', 'how', 'war', 'shaped', 'history', 'beloved', 'country', 'United', 'States', 'America.Ken', 'Burns', 'use', 'archival', 'photos', 'interviews', 'historians', 'original', 'traditional', 'music', 'voice-overs', 'well-known', 'actors', 'such', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Jason', 'Roberts', 'make', 'epic', 'haunting', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'clearly', 'sense', 'irony', 'However', 'facts', 'make', 'story', 'real', 'facts', 'chill', 'bone', 'More', 'then', '618,000', 'people', 'lost', 'lives', 'Civil', 'War', 'Battle', 'Gettysburg', 'alone', 'were', '54,112', 'casualties', 'including', 'wounded', 'who', 'often', 'had', 'have', 'limbs', 'amputated', 'guns', 'shot', 'bullets', 'spray', 'literally', 'destroyed', 'bones.The', 'film', 'divided', 'nine', 'episodes', 'first', 'history', 'causes', 'war', 'could', 'feel', 'tension', 'mounting', 'episode', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'was', 'especially', 'sad', 'see', 'enthusiasm', 'confederates', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'misplaced', 'second', 'episode', 'out', 'how', 'war', 'preserve', 'union', 'became', 'war', 'free', 'slaves', 'also', 'new', 'weapons', 'such', 'ironclad', 'ships', 'had', 'heard', 'ironclad', 'ships', 'now', 'became', 'real', 'especially', 'introduction', 'diaries', 'men', 'who', 'actually', 'manned', 'third', 'episode', 'Union', 'forces', 'are', 'suffering', 'defeat', 'Lincoln', 'still', 'go', 'ahead', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'series', 'are', 'constantly', 'learning', 'generals', 'sides', 'fourth', 'episode', 'see', 'combat', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Ulysses', 'S.', 'Grant', 'Throughout', 'also', 'feel', 'humanity', 'interviews', 'historians', 'specifically', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'really', 'bring', 'out', 'turning', 'point', 'War', 'battle', 'Gettysburg', 'draft', 'riots', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'depicted', 'fifth', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'beginning', 'use', 'Negro', 'troops', 'Union', 'forces', 'are', 'more', 'battles', 'sixth', 'episode', 'description', 'Lincoln', 'bid', 'reelection', 'seventh', 'episode', 'see', 'people', 'turning', 'war', 'battles', 'continue', 'rage', 'General', 'Sherman', 'march', 'sea', 'highlight', 'eighth', 'episode', 'Victory', 'assured', 'Union', 'Confederates', 'continue', 'fight', 'South', 'being', 'destroyed', 'Then', 'ninth', 'episode', 'war', 'finally', 'not', 'lot', 'sorrow', 'Lincoln', 'lived', 'see', 'end', 'war', 'then', 'life', 'ended', 'assassination.Life', 'Years', 'pass', 'soldiers', 'who', 'lived', 'War', 'turn', 'old', 'men', 'march', 'parades', 'Eventually', 'see', 'more', 'memory', 'war', 'only', 'history', 'books', ""'m"", 'inspired', 'read', 'more', 'even', 'explored', 'reading', 'Shelby', 'Foote', '3-volume', 'saga', 'when', 'looked', 'bookstore', 'discovered', 'book', '900', 'dense', 'pages', 'long', 'could', 'barely', 'lift', 'book', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'history', 'historians', 'why', ""'m"", 'so', 'delighted', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'made', 'series', 'want', 'learn', 'definitive', 'period', 'history', 'classic', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'work', 'way', 'go', 'give', 'highest', 'recommendation']",N/A

Yes, it is a documentary and yes, it is a TV miniseries, but to lump this 11-hour look at America's darkest years does not do this masterpiece justice.  Burns' masterful ability to enrapt his audience is a testament to his storytelling abilities, abilities that most of today's so-called filmmakers should long to achieve.Using a documentary style so closely linked to him that it is now called ""The Ken Burns' Style,"" Burns took what little physical pieces he had to work with (letters and photos) and used them to his advantage to create an intimacy no other documentary had ever managed to achieve.  By doing so, Burns took non-fiction storytelling to new heights in a way that while commonplace today was revolutionary back in 1990.  Relying on emotional narration (especially the brilliant David McCullough, the film's main narrator) and stirring period music, the audience is not given a history lesson, but rather told a story; a touching, emotional story of a nation divided, a beleaguered President and battles pitting brother against brother and friend against friend.While yes, it is the greatest documentary ever made and it is without a doubt the greatest program ever aired on television, to label ""The Civil War"" as simply a TV show is to not give this FILM its due, a film that certainly ranks among the greatest of all-time, if not as the greatest ever.",5,The Greatest Film Ever?

289590,A1AL45IEVLFUCB,6301996135,Merlin,"[2, 2]","This series is THE definitive documentary on the American Civil War - it's the first of it's kind in style and content and powerfully evocative of the spirit of the time.  However, there are some inconsistencies which become apparent to the attentive viewer.  For example, statements made throughout the film representing North and South waiver between certainty of Northern perserverance and widespread dissension regarding Lincoln's leadership - points which are not in agreement and do not make a cohesive statement about the momentum of the Union.  And as 'CenterMan' states in his review,  this documentary has a decidedly 'Eastern' tilt and emphasis, probably because Burns is himself a New Englander. The Western states and territories played an extremely important part in the war both militarily and economically, but this is not touched on. To back up another of 'CenterMan's points, the armies of the West, and ESPECIALLY the Generals of the West, were utterly essential to the evolution of the war and warefare in general by the North, from an Eastern generals' stalemate to a frontiersmens' sweep.  Most all of the generals who were made famous by the Civil War, both North and South,  earned their stripes and first practiced their military trade serving together as field officers in the Mexican-American War twenty years prior, and in fact the North's superior use of artillery throughout the war was largely the result of methods first tried and learned by Yankee gunners and officers at Vera Cruz and Mexico City. Both Sherman and Grant, who made broad sweeping movements using entire army groups and army corps became familiar with these tactics in the wide open expanses of the Mexico and then the Indian territories, and used them to devastating effect against the flash and elan of the Confederates. Also, the political and financial importance of California, Utah, and Oregon, which supplied desperately needed cash and gold to the Union in spite of a large seccessionist element, is completely overlooked by Burns. This seems to point out a kind of misperception among many Easterners, both then and now, that the United States is centered on and revolves around their section of the country.  It is a serious misperception and is a major reason the rift between North and South reached the breadth and depth that it did.  Burns focuses on the traditional military and socially emotional issues of the war, which are shown anew, but he does not cover the cornerstones of demographics (the huge disparity in population growth between North and South, in birthrates and immigration) agriculture, finance, or industry, (in particular steel and the railroads), both before and during the war, which are essential to a broad understanding of the Civil War.  Ultimately this documentary is an excellent introductory showpiece and is thoroughly engrossing, and should hopefully inspire students of the subject to probe deeper into it.

289600,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,6301996135,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[2, 2]","This is the quintessential documentary on the American Civil War by Ken Burns. Forty million viewers watched it during its initial broadcast, making it the most-watched program ever to air on PBS. It was awarded more than 40 major television and film honors. The film was remastered on the twelfth anniversary of its release, and a book following the movie has also been released.Ken Burns was inspired to make this documentary because of Mathew Brady's photographs. More than 10 hours in length, the documentary has nine episodes that explore the Civil War through personal stories and photos. During the creation of the movie, Burns made extensive use of more than 16,000 archival photographs, paintings, and newspaper images from the time of the war. This resulted in the coining of the term the ""Ken Burns Effect."" (Wiki).This was my third time watching it so I'll just list some of the remarks which stood out for me this time around (first time doing an actual review):More than 3 million men fought in it and over 600,000 died in it.So many Southerners applied that a third had to be turned away early on. Odds were against them with a Union population of 21 million to their 9 million which included 4 million unarmed slaves. The value of all manufactured goods were  of those produced in the state of New York but the South didn't care.At Fort Sumter in South Carolina General Beaureguard fired on Major Anderson, his old artillery instructor who kept him on for an extra year as an aide. This was truly a war in which family and friends were pitted against one another.At the Battle of Shiloh General Albert Sidney Johnston nobly sent his surgeon back to tend to Union soldiers and then took a grievous wound that could have been stopped if said surgeon had been around but no dice. Last shot fired at Shiloh was a group of Union boys trying to take out General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was part of the cavalry rear guard to slow them down. He took a wound to his side.Shiloh had the same number of casualties as Waterloo of 1815. It convinced Grant that this was going to be a war of conquest and would therefore take a long time, not a few months as some had predicted.Ironically Shiloh is a Hebrew word that means: ""Place of peace.""First land mines and telescopic sights and repeating guns (fore runners of the machine gun) showed up in the American Civil War. Elongated bullets began the demise of the bayonet charge. High casualties were because the weapons were way ahead of the tactics.General Jackson, who never wanted a letter in transit on a Sunday, sucked on lemons constantly and kept one hand in the air constantly to stay balanced. Thirty six miles a day marches were common for his men but they faithfullfully stomped along because of his victories. At the Second Bull Run Battle Southern soldiers hurled rocks when their ammo ran out.Private Elijah Woods and other Union soldiers saw CSA General Stonewall Jackson who was entertaining ladies. They looked across at each other and Jackson even used his eyeglass but neither shot at each other. Woods said it would have been ""murder"" to do so and what use was it?General Sickles lost a leg at Gettysburg and as he was taken away his men saw him cooly smoking a cigar.General Forrest was said to have had 30 horses killed underneath him and also killed 31 men in one on one melee combat which surpasses any general on either side during the war.La Belle Rebel, the southern belle spy who charmed Union boys even after she was jailed yet she was able to smuggle secret information out in rubber balls to a contact who passed it along to Richmond.Davis, the spy who was so brave at his hanging, that the Union leader stalled in giving the order to hang him so Davis gave the order and died.Sherman and Grant, buddies going back to their old days and both Ohio boys who frowned on pomp and the like turned out to be the best Union commanders of armies.The siege of Atlanta in which President Davis and his people made the mistake of removing General Joseph E. Johnston and putting the bulldogged John Bell Hood in charge. Hood proceeded to leave the defenses and attack and lose a third of his army (20,000). At one point during the siege a Georgia bugler played so well that both sides would stop to listen.General Meigs, a true hater of the CSA (Conferate States of America), built a cemetery around Robert E. Lee's house and confiscated most of the land. It was later returned to Lee's heirs after a lawsuit but one of those heirs chose to later sell it back to the government for a tidy sum. Today this is known as the Arlington Cemetery.Grant refusing to get to the point until Lee brought it up. The scribe's hand shaking and somebody else having to write for him. Grant being polite and making conversation with Lee. Lee doffing his hat as he left the negotiations.When Edmund Ruffin (who fired the first shot of the Civil War on Sumter) found out that the CSA had conceded he wrapped himself in a CSA flag and shot himself.82 year old General Joseph E. Johnston was a pall bearer at General Sherman's funeral (they had been rivals during the war but later became friends) in 1891. As a sign of respect he kept his hat off during the cold, rainy weather, caught pneumonia and died ten days later.""Little Mac"" (General George B. McClellan became governor of New Jersey; General Beaureguard promoted railroad companies; General Forrest started the KKK but quit when it grew too violent for him; Sickles escaped court martial and gave his lost leg to the Army Historical Medical Center; General Hood died in the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1878; General Pickett never got over his charge and suffered severe depression; General Longstreet joined the Republicans and dared to criticize Lee's strategy at Gettysburg and was considered traitor by his comrades in arms; in his later years General Grant's fortune was lost so he

There are 9 episodes of just over an hour long. The main body of narrative is made up of letters, articles, memoirs, novels and diaries from the period.  Leading historians contribute stories of their own; Shelby Foote in particular - a southern gentlemen judging from his dialect - is full of laugh-out-loud anecdotes and fresh insights. My favourite is the story of the southern politician who, on the eve of the conflict, was so confident the war would be over quickly, that he offered to mop up every single drop of blood with his pocket handkerchief. Shelby Foote is sure that there's a PhD for anybody who can calculate how many pocket handkerchiefs it would have taken to mop up the blood shed during the war.The narrative is brought to life by photographs from the period - some beautiful, some startling, some terrible, but all fascinating. These are worth the admission price alone. There is also modern day film footage of the key places of the war.What is truly remarkable, however, is how this vividly this period is brought to life without a SINGLE RECONSTRUCTION. The viewer is encouraged to use his/her own imagination.And I haven't even mentioned the actors who do the voices: Morgan Freeman, Jeremy Irons, Derek Jacobi, Sam Waterston, Jason Robards to name just a few.I've seen a few documentaries about the American civil war, but Mr. Ken Burns has rendered them all obsolete.

289605,A2BXS4GU3L6RJY,6301996135,MovieFann,"[1, 1]","In 1990, PBS launched an ambitious project by a young film producer, Ken Burns and his brother Ric.  The most factual and eloquently narrated (by David McCullough) story of America's most devisive and costly historical conflict whose ramifications still are debated today:  The American Civil War.From the onset of this epic we are seduced by a sweet yet sorrowful violin serenade which meanders through  introductory chapters to an almost epilogue-like closure to the many horrific post battle scenes as  eyewitness accounts are offered; field dispatches, letters (both personal and official) voiced by several well known individuals such as the great Morgan Freeman as the tenascious Abolitionist, Fredrick Douglass.  This entire production has become the benchmark from which all historical documentaries look to for perfection..........As an avid reader and follower of the Civil War I was taken back to the early years, back to the earliest days of the simmering issues of Abolition and States Rights.  Mr Burns chronicals the divide which started as festering wound to the final hemmorhage of the Union; neither victimizing nor criminalizing the moral struggles of not just the residents of the border states but also the United States Congress....Romantic ideals, ringing in the rhetoric of our political leaders and those who felt sucession and the enivitable entry into war, fuelled the fatal belief that each side was right.The battle scenes were enhanced by soundtracks so realistic you feel that you were there-the voices of combatants, exploding cannon shells, the clash of sabers during Calvary charges, gunshots and screams of their victims as they fell as leaves in the fall........Voices of the great Commanders, Generals and President Lincoln attest to the uncertainty of the widespread slaughter and the yearning for its end.  Many times I felt the fear and horror that our soldiers must have felt upon being led to certain death (witness the horrific battles of the Wilderness, Antietam and Cold Harbor)  This was the most emotional, costly yet defining event in the young evolution of our United States.....Many of our greatest Military as well as Political leaders participated in this conflict....witness the wisdom imparted (much which has also become inscriptions on statues, placques and quotes in American History books today) both on and off the battlefield.  I believe it was a great Roman General (if not Ceasar himself) who spoke that &#34;only the dead know the end of war&#34;In closing, this is the GREATEST cinematic presentation on the Civil War; painstakingly researched, professionally presented, delightfully enhanced by opinions of renowned Civil War Historians (Shelby Foote was the best!!!!) with a hauntingly beautiful musical score--Ken Burns has offered a look into perhaps the most tumultous and devastating period in our history--and in doing so, united us in the knowledge that &#34;a House divided cannot stand.....&#34;",5,A House Divided,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,2969,"['1990', 'PBS', 'launched', 'ambitious', 'project', 'young', 'film', 'producer', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'brother', 'Ric', 'most', 'factual', 'eloquently', 'narrated', 'David', 'McCullough', 'story', 'America', 'most', 'devisive', 'costly', 'historical', 'conflict', 'ramifications', 'still', 'are', 'debated', 'today', 'American', 'Civil', 'onset', 'epic', 'are', 'seduced', 'sweet', 'yet', 'sorrowful', 'violin', 'serenade', 'meanders', 'introductory', 'chapters', 'almost', 'epilogue-like', 'closure', 'many', 'horrific', 'post', 'battle', 'scenes', 'eyewitness', 'accounts', 'are', 'offered', 'field', 'dispatches', 'letters', 'personal', 'official', 'voiced', 'several', 'well', 'known', 'individuals', 'such', 'great', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'tenascious', 'Abolitionist', 'Fredrick', 'Douglass', 'entire', 'production', 'become', 'benchmark', 'historical', 'documentaries', 'look', 'perfection', 'avid', 'reader', 'follower', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'taken', 'back', 'early', 'years', 'back', 'earliest', 'days', 'simmering', 'issues', 'Abolition', 'States', 'Rights', 'Mr', 'Burns', 'divide', 'started', 'festering', 'wound', 'final', 'hemmorhage', 'Union', 'victimizing', 'criminalizing', 'moral', 'struggles', 'not', 'just', 'residents', 'border', 'states', 'also', 'United', 'States', 'Congress', '.Romantic', 'ideals', 'ringing', 'rhetoric', 'political', 'leaders', 'who', 'felt', 'sucession', 'enivitable', 'entry', 'war', 'fuelled', 'fatal', 'belief', 'side', 'was', 'right.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'enhanced', 'soundtracks', 'so', 'realistic', 'feel', 'were', 'there-the', 'voices', 'combatants', 'exploding', 'cannon', 'shells', 'clash', 'sabers', 'Calvary', 'charges', 'gunshots', 'screams', 'victims', 'fell', 'leaves', 'fall', '..Voices', 'great', 'Commanders', 'Generals', 'President', 'Lincoln', 'attest', 'uncertainty', 'widespread', 'slaughter', 'yearning', 'end', 'Many', 'times', 'felt', 'fear', 'horror', 'soldiers', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'being', 'led', 'certain', 'death', 'horrific', 'battles', 'Wilderness', 'Antietam', 'Cold', 'Harbor', 'was', 'most', 'emotional', 'costly', 'yet', 'defining', 'event', 'young', 'evolution', 'United', 'States', '..Many', 'greatest', 'Military', 'as', 'well', 'Political', 'leaders', 'participated', 'conflict', 'wisdom', 'imparted', 'much', 'also', 'become', 'inscriptions', 'statues', 'placques', 'quotes', 'American', 'History', 'books', 'today', 'battlefield', 'believe', 'was', 'great', 'Roman', 'General', 'not', 'Ceasar', 'who', 'spoke', '34', 'only', 'dead', 'know', 'end', 'war', '34', 'closing', 'GREATEST', 'cinematic', 'presentation', 'Civil', 'War', 'painstakingly', 'researched', 'professionally', 'presented', 'delightfully', 'enhanced', 'opinions', 'renowned', 'Civil', 'War', 'Historians', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'was', 'best', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'offered', 'look', 'perhaps', 'most', 'tumultous', 'devastating', 'period', 'history', 'doing', 'so', 'united', 'knowledge', '34', 'House', 'divided', 'can', 'not', 'stand', '..', '34']",N/A

It started my lifelong interest in the Civil War.  Countless books and trips to battlefields later, it still stands as the finest general work on the war ever made.The story of the war is told through pictures, narratives, and the unobtrusive narration by David McCoulough, who's voice is pitch pefect for the job.  Never before have photos had such a dramatic effect in telling a story.  They say a picture says a thousand words, and this series prove that maxim correct.  The five discs cover the 5 years of the war, and the 9 parts of teh series.  The most effective are &quot;1861: The Cause&quot;, &quot;1863: The Universe of Battle&quot;, and &quot;1865: The Better Angels of our Nature&quot;.  They cover the events that led up to the war, the turining points at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, and the end and aftermath of the war.  Each is suprememly emotional.  One episode intersperses an old narrative from the daughter of a former slave as she remembers her father's stories.  Shelby Foote, author of the most comprehensive book on the war, offers invaluable advice.  High praise must also go to Sam Waterston, who voices Abraham Lincoln.  In the final segment of the 1863 disc, Waterston recites the Gettysburg Address, and I must admit it brought me to tears.The music is also a key factor to the success of the film.  Burns went back and found the old music that was popular among the people and the soldiers, both North &amp; South during the war.  It is moving, from the haunting opening music, to the old spirituals that are found on disc 2's &quot;1862: Forever Free&quot;.  Add that to a stable of great voice actors, (besides Waterston, Morgan Freeman as Frederick Douglass and George Plimpton as George Tempelton Strong are standouts), and the film becomes almost magical, transporting the viewer to those 4 horrible years that changed the Nation forever.The Civil War is the most important saga in American History, and this documentary gives the people who fought it and the effect the War had on the US as a people the proper historical weight and respect.

289632,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,6301996135,R. Nicholson,"[9, 9]","Having just finished watching The Civil War by Ken Burns I felt I had to review it. The DVD, on 6 discs, encompass the entire civil war from beginning to end, including important events that preceded the firing of the first shot.In the end, the union won of course, but was somewhat lucky to do so: despite continually squandering the advantage of numerical superiority and the innumerable opportunities they had for victory.Although it is difficult to describe what so compelling and addictive about this work, I believe, one of the factors is the beauty of the story telling. The main portion of the series in simply nothing more than old black and white photographs captured by photographers of the day; images with a ghostly, grainy quality that makes for a special eerie affect. I do not think colored pictures, somehow, would have been effective in creating the mood that these B &W; photos do: simple images of men in their barracks, in front of a tent, on a horse etc. or sometimes grotesque scenes of death and destruction after a battle. The fact that so many of these images survived is a miracle in itself.Just as important is the beautiful, narrative voice of David McCullough and others historians who give expert commentary and actors who read letters written by people involved in this event.However, in my opinion, it is the music that sets this epic event apart from any other work on the same topic. The Ashoken Farewell by Jay Ungar begins each installment: it is hard to imagine a more fitting piece of music that could preface each episode: this haunting melody, played by a solo violin, seems to capture the raw essence of the story so perfectly: it simply seems to reach out and touch the soul.  The majority of the music accompanying the story is played by solo guitar, piano, banjo or violin: and again the singular instrument seems much more appropriate than orchestrated music: capturing the ever increasing loneliness and solitude that these men must have felt as the war dragged on throughout these four years.All in all, the photographs, the narrative, and the music blend together to make an unforgettable 10 hour series that surly is one of the most important events not only in American history, but maybe even more importantly, for the entire world.",5,The Civil War:  Ken Burns masterpiece,1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,2284,"['Having', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Civil', 'War', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'felt', 'had', 'review', 'DVD', '6', 'discs', 'encompass', 'entire', 'civil', 'war', 'beginning', 'end', 'including', 'important', 'events', 'preceded', 'firing', 'first', 'end', 'union', 'won', 'course', 'was', 'somewhat', 'lucky', 'do', 'so', 'continually', 'squandering', 'advantage', 'numerical', 'superiority', 'innumerable', 'opportunities', 'had', 'difficult', 'describe', 'what', 'compelling', 'addictive', 'work', 'believe', 'one', 'factors', 'beauty', 'story', 'telling', 'main', 'portion', 'series', 'simply', 'nothing', 'more', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'photographs', 'captured', 'photographers', 'day', 'images', 'ghostly', 'grainy', 'quality', 'special', 'eerie', 'affect', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'colored', 'pictures', 'somehow', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'creating', 'mood', 'B', 'W', 'photos', 'do', 'simple', 'images', 'men', 'barracks', 'front', 'tent', 'horse', 'etc', 'sometimes', 'grotesque', 'scenes', 'death', 'destruction', 'battle', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'images', 'survived', 'miracle', 'itself.Just', 'important', 'beautiful', 'narrative', 'voice', 'David', 'McCullough', 'others', 'historians', 'who', 'give', 'expert', 'commentary', 'actors', 'who', 'read', 'letters', 'written', 'people', 'involved', 'event.However', 'opinion', 'music', 'epic', 'event', 'apart', 'other', 'work', 'same', 'topic', 'Ashoken', 'Farewell', 'Jay', 'Ungar', 'installment', 'hard', 'imagine', 'more', 'fitting', 'piece', 'music', 'could', 'preface', 'episode', 'haunting', 'melody', 'played', 'solo', 'violin', 'capture', 'raw', 'essence', 'story', 'so', 'perfectly', 'simply', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'soul', 'majority', 'music', 'accompanying', 'story', 'played', 'solo', 'guitar', 'piano', 'banjo', 'violin', 'again', 'singular', 'instrument', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'orchestrated', 'music', 'capturing', 'ever', 'increasing', 'loneliness', 'solitude', 'men', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'war', 'dragged', 'four', 'years.All', 'photographs', 'narrative', 'music', 'blend', 'together', 'make', 'unforgettable', '10', 'hour', 'series', 'surly', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'not', 'only', 'American', 'history', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'entire', 'world']",N/A

Crawford,"[14, 17]","This is a superb film, combining the emotion evoked from images and selected narratives (wonderfully read by great actors) as well as some analysis by prominent scholars or writers. So far as it goes, Burns has exploited the attributes of the film medium to what I believe is the maximum extent: you leave this experience with a good idea of what went on and how it changed the country. It is moving, horrible, and beautiful all at once.That being said, I believe that Burns was also very conscious of what the film medium could accomplish less well, i.e. the deeper scholarly treatment that can only be plumbed from the concentration and effort that books demand. That is where some of the reviewers here went wrong IMHO, as they expected more than a film can reasonably deliver. This is not a university lecture and there is not enough space to explore all the details as they might deserve. Nonetheless, I did not find any glaring inaccuracies or unacceptable biases - it was a good critical bit of work.What you get with Burns is a taste of the Civil War, some clear ideas, and feelings about what happened. For real depth of understanding, the viewer will have to go elsewhere, and that is fine. After all, this is a life long labor of love for some of us Civil War buffs.I watched this while my son (7) played next to me, and every so often he would look up and ask questions about what was portrayed - it was a nice bonding medium, got him thinking a bit, and engraved certain images into his mind.

289638,A16QODENBJVUI1,6301996135,Robert Moore,"[30, 33]","Ken Burn's THE CIVIL WAR was a watershed moment in the history of television documentary.  The influence of this series can hardly be overstated, with a horde of documentaries on PBS and The History Channel adopting many of the techniques that Burn's mastered here.  When the series was first broadcast on PBS in 1990, I was utterly enchanted--along with millions of others--with the unique blend of narration by David McCullough, archival photographs combined with contemporary location shots, lines from famous individuals read by professional actors and other celebrities, sound effects, commentary by professional historians, and beautiful music that contained just a touch of melancholy.  I had never seen anything like it, and the only things I have seen like it since have shamelessly imitated it.The DVDs not only provide a superior copy of the original series, but also contain a number of excellent features, including additional interviews and a wealth of other goodies.  I had rewatched much of the series on video, but I found the color somewhat off.  The DVD is a great improvement.There are so many things to praise about this series.  It isn't perfect, and not all will agree with the emphases.  The interpretation follows fairly consistently that of James McPherson and Shelby Foote who saw slavery as the root cause of the war, unlike previous generations of historians who out of a respect to Southerners (I'm a Southerner, for the record, though I now live in Chicago) de-emphasized slavery and identified the cause of the war more with states's rights than slavery.  But what can't be argued is the brilliantly vivid way that Burns and his collaborators manage to bring back to life a time long past.  There are countless photographs and not just those by &quot;Matthew Brady&quot; (most of the photographs attributed to Brady where taken by his assistants, primarily Alexander Gardner, who deserves the reputation that Brady has), but from all over the United States.  All the disparate elements are blended seamlessly to produce a nearly unblemished surface.The quality of the voice-overs was, at the time of this series release, utterly unprecedented.  A host of well-known individuals were used in the readings, but the principle ones were Sam Waterson as Abraham Lincoln, Julie Harris as Mary Chestnut, Jason Robards as Ulysses S. Grant, Morgan Freeman as Frederick Douglas, Garrison Keillor as Walt Whitman, journalist Charley McDowell as Private Sam Watkins, George Plimpton as George Templeton Strong, and a host of others.  My favorite may be playwright Arthur Miller, who marvelously provides the gruff voice for the remarkable statements by William Tecumseh Sherman.But despite all this excellence, one person managed to steal the whole show:  Shelby Foote.  It is simply shocking that amidst all these riches that many of the greatest moments of the show consisted of a lone Southern historian reflecting on the meaning of the war.  Foote, although well known for his monumental narrative history of the war, was more or less an unknown.  But the series made him a media star, a role that he refused to take on or exploit.  Of the ten greatest moments on the series, perhaps seven of them involve Foote, whether explaining that the Civil War was the central event of American history, that it made us a nation (before the war people would say &quot;the United States are&quot; but afterwards they say &quot;the United States is&quot;), or eloquently talking of the brilliance of Nathan Bedford Forrest, or stating that Gettysburg was the cost the South had to pay for having Robert E. Lee lead the Army of Northern Virginia.  He was partly his Southern drawl, partly his remarkable ability to distilling a point to its essence, and partly his mastery of words.The great thing about this series is that even if you have read such classics as Douglas Southall Freeman's LEE'S LIEUTENANTS and his four-volume biography of Lee, McPherson's BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, and Foote's THE CIVIL WAR, Burn's documentary will make the war come alive in a completely new and exciting way.  This set will therefore be essential viewing for all serious students of the Civil War, as well as nearly anyone even remotely curious about American history, or, for that matter, great television.",5,The birth of the modern television documentary,1068595200,"11 12, 2003",2003,4303,"['Ken', 'Burn', 'THE', 'CIVIL', 'WAR', 'was', 'watershed', 'moment', 'history', 'television', 'documentary', 'influence', 'series', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'overstated', 'horde', 'documentaries', 'PBS', 'History', 'Channel', 'adopting', 'many', 'techniques', 'Burn', 'mastered', 'here', 'When', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'PBS', '1990', 'was', 'utterly', 'enchanted', 'millions', 'others', 'unique', 'blend', 'narration', 'David', 'McCullough', 'archival', 'photographs', 'combined', 'contemporary', 'location', 'shots', 'lines', 'famous', 'individuals', 'read', 'professional', 'actors', 'other', 'celebrities', 'sound', 'effects', 'commentary', 'professional', 'historians', 'beautiful', 'music', 'contained', 'just', 'touch', 'melancholy', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'only', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'shamelessly', 'imitated', 'it.The', 'DVDs', 'not', 'only', 'provide', 'superior', 'copy', 'original', 'series', 'also', 'contain', 'number', 'excellent', 'features', 'including', 'additional', 'interviews', 'wealth', 'other', 'goodies', 'had', 'rewatched', 'much', 'series', 'video', 'found', 'color', 'somewhat', 'DVD', 'great', 'improvement.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'praise', 'series', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'not', 'will', 'agree', 'emphases', 'interpretation', 'fairly', 'consistently', 'James', 'McPherson', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'who', 'saw', 'slavery', 'root', 'cause', 'war', 'previous', 'generations', 'historians', 'who', 'respect', 'Southerners', ""'m"", 'Southerner', 'record', 'now', 'live', 'Chicago', 'de-emphasized', 'slavery', 'identified', 'cause', 'war', 'more', 'states', 'rights', 'slavery', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'argued', 'brilliantly', 'vivid', 'way', 'Burns', 'collaborators', 'manage', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'time', 'long', 'past', 'are', 'countless', 'photographs', 'not', 'just', 'quot', 'Matthew', 'Brady', 'quot', 'most', 'photographs', 'attributed', 'Brady', 'where', 'taken', 'assistants', 'primarily', 'Alexander', 'Gardner', 'who', 'reputation', 'Brady', 'United', 'States', 'disparate', 'elements', 'are', 'blended', 'seamlessly', 'produce', 'nearly', 'unblemished', 'surface.The', 'quality', 'voice-overs', 'was', 'time', 'series', 'release', 'utterly', 'unprecedented', 'host', 'well-known', 'individuals', 'were', 'used', 'readings', 'principle', 'ones', 'were', 'Sam', 'Waterson', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'Mary', 'Chestnut', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Ulysses', 'S.', 'Grant', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Frederick', 'Douglas', 'Garrison', 'Keillor', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'journalist', 'Charley', 'McDowell', 'Private', 'Sam', 'Watkins', 'George', 'Plimpton', 'George', 'Templeton', 'Strong', 'host', 'others', 'favorite', 'may', 'be', 'playwright', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'who', 'marvelously', 'gruff', 'voice', 'remarkable', 'statements', 'William', 'Tecumseh', 'Sherman.But', 'excellence', 'one', 'person', 'managed', 'steal', 'whole', 'show', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'simply', 'shocking', 'amidst', 'riches', 'many', 'greatest', 'moments', 'show', 'consisted', 'lone', 'Southern', 'historian', 'reflecting', 'meaning', 'war', 'Foote', 'well', 'known', 'monumental', 'narrative', 'history', 'war', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'unknown', 'series', 'made', 'media', 'star', 'role', 'refused', 'take', 'exploit', 'ten', 'greatest', 'moments', 'series', 'perhaps', 'seven', 'involve', 'Foote', 'explaining', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'central', 'event', 'American', 'history', 'made', 'nation', 'war', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'quot', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'quot', 'say', 'quot', 'United', 'States', 'quot', 'eloquently', 'talking', 'brilliance', 'Nathan', 'Bedford', 'Forrest', 'stating', 'Gettysburg', 'was', 'cost', 'South', 'had', 'pay', 'having', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'lead', 'Army', 'Northern', 'Virginia', 'was', 'partly', 'Southern', 'drawl', 'partly', 'remarkable', 'ability', 'distilling', 'point', 'essence', 'partly', 'mastery', 'words.The', 'great', 'thing', 'series', 'even', 'have', 'read', 'such', 'classics', 'Douglas', 'Southall', 'Freeman', 'LEE', 'LIEUTENANTS', 'four-volume', 'biography', 'Lee', 'McPherson', 'BATTLE', 'CRY', 'OF', 'FREEDOM', 'Foote', 'THE', 'CIVIL', 'WAR', 'Burn', 'documentary', 'will', 'make', 'war', 'come', 'alive', 'completely', 'new', 'exciting', 'way', 'set', 'will', 'therefore', 'be', 'essential', 'viewing', 'serious', 'students', 'Civil', 'War', 'as', 'well', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'curious', 'American', 'history', 'matter', 'great', 'television']",N/A

289643,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,6301996135,Rocco Dormarunno,"[4, 5]","How anyone could not appreciate this tremendous documentary is beyond comprehension. Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" gives us an unforgettable look at a country tearing itself apart, piece by piece. Beginning with the death knell that clanged as each state seceded from the Union, we are prepared for the disaster that would be the Civil War. The countless haunting images of battlefields and hospitals, the photos of amputated limbs in an ambulatory waste can are shocking but powerful. The short section entitled ""Now, Fix Me"" is so heartbreaking, it reminds the viewer how these men suffered and how they paid the ultimate price.What must also be appreciated is that Brooklyn-born Ken Burns relied so much on southerner Shelby Foote's analysis of the war. While it may be argued that Burns relied too much on the late Shelby Foote, who better to turn to? Anyone who's read his extensive, three-volume history of the war between the states will recognize that he was the best resource at the time. In fact, I would highly recommend reading Foote's trilogy after watching this film.The cast of actors, actresses, and singers who provided the voices are so near-perfect as to be nothing short of inspired. Sam Waterson's Abraham Lincoln, particularly his reading of the Gettysburg Address and Lincoln's second inaugural speech, is very moving to say the least. In fact, this entire documentary is so moving and informative that Ken Burns could not top it in his later documentaries.

It gives one a well-rounded view of both sides.  I am in awe of the writings of that time--the people had an incredibly, descriptive way of writing; a command of the English language that has sadly been lost in modern times.Burns also used still photographs, panning across them, giving the audience the feel of watching an actual movie of the time.  That technique has since been adopted by other documentaries.I've seen the series many times, and each time find something more.

Not only is the Civil War brought to life but by the end of the entire 11 hour series you feel like you've been through the war itself.The most important achievement of the documentary is showing how the war, with all its carnage, achieved the higher purpose of freeing the slaves. While the war may have started with the notion of keeping the tattered union together, it eventually brought societal, constitutional, economic, and medical changes that would have otherwise not come about had their not been a war. It truly was the birth of a ""new freedom"".You watch as new innovative tactics are introduced out of sheer necessity. You see thousands of men using outdated tactics (charging a defense line with your bayonet) are mowed down by new weapons such as the gattling gun and the Repeating Rifle. You witness the banality of siege warfare as implemented by Gen. George McClellan. And you contrast that with maneuver warfare brilliantly executed by Stonewall Jackson and Nathan Bedford Forrest. You learn how the generals (and the country at large) grew to appreciate and utilize the telegram. You learn from General Lee how to lead from the front and how a few men effectively positioned can hold off 100 men. You witness how incompetent Union generals nearly lost the war to an inferior army. With only a rudimentary understanding in medicine, tens of thousands died from disease and from reparable surface wounds. However, without the enormous loss of life, we would have never made the medical and tactical advances that the war brought on.More than any other character in the documentary, I enjoyed historian Shelby Foote the most. His amusing Mississippi drawl and the way he personalized the war made you realize the humanity of these legendary figures. He also highlighted how resentment towards blacks lasted for decades after the war (how the south still hates Lincoln, how Vicksburg refused to celebrate 4th of July for 80 years).

So, I've modified my favorite quote of Confucius somewhat, yet one has to understand the present and past ""to divine the future""; I think Confucius implies that. The American Civil War was a significant event of American history, no doubt about that. I watched a bootlegged VHS version of this recorded from the PBS series. What I like most about this film is the commentaries from different historians about the Civil War years. I particularly enjoyed Shelby Foote's and Barbara Fields' remarks. Shelby Foote's three volume set on the Civil War is a classic; he is a southerner who is also a veteran who served in WWII. Barbara Field is an African American historian. I felt that it was not biased and succeeded in showing faithfully what life was like during that era for people on all sides, and not just soldiers on the battlefields, by showing photographs of battle scenes and sites and soldiers, and by revealing the emotions of men and women who lived and died during that time through letters they wrote. On such an emotionally charged subject and divisive one at that, the series ends on a note of unity and understanding and caution. And I add we must understand this past, its real causes, to avoid repeating such tragedies in the future. Ken Burns and company did a beautiful job at illuminating an ugly and harrowing subject.One of the songs that plays wordlessly in the background at various times during this documentary is a tune that was recycled probably from an Irish tune from 1688 during the Glorious Revolution there. It was known during America's Revolution as Johnny's Gone for a Soldier, in the late 1600's and before 1776, it was also called Shule Agra and Buttermilk Hill. One must wonder at why the southerners suffered so many deprivations during the war to keep fighting like they did without shoes on their feet and little food, marching and marching for countless miles, 20-30 a day. I agree with others when they say that the subject of reconstruction is not dealt with in this film. It is an important subject too but is more than enough for a film of its own. After the war, southerners had their properties confiscated which engendered the term carpet bagger to denote the true motives of northern transplants to the south. Such were some of the liberators of American slaves.

Ken Burns made a masterpiece with 'The Civil War.'From the photographs, the rare footage of the reunion of civil war veterans at the 75th anniversary of the battle at Gettysburg, the telling of the story of persons famous and not, using voices famous and not, the basic narration of David McCullough, the dividing of the episodes into coherent segments, this is a film NOT TO BE MISSED by anyone who has any interest at all in the world around them.I still run into people who have not seen this film.  Were they on Mars when it came out?  This remains PBS' most highly-rated program, and appropriately so.I've recently watched it again, and I can tell you that after the 10th viewing, it is as compelling as the first.  It is a landmark achievement, it is a winning effort, and it has a haunting and very effective soundtrack.  And the restoration available now makes the film even better.Burns' other documentaries are very good, especially 'Baseball'.  But he reached an insurmountable peak in 'The Civil War.'  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience to watch this film. If so some reason you have not viewed this stunning work, you really owe it to yourself and your family to purchase this DVD series and watch it with the spouse and kids.I am planning to lend my copy out to a friend (I don't know if she was on Mars or not in 1990).  I was concerned that I was building up the film so much that there was the risk that she'd be disappointed.  No chance.  I've seen it many times, remember how excellent it was, and yet I could hardly stop watching it again, recently, as the clock rolled around to two o'clock in the morning, with work just a few hours away.I consider myself blessed that I was alive to watch this.If ever there was an essential documentary, this is it.

To say the least, I was a bit dissapointed. Even though it was extremely stirring in many scenes, it was terribly one-sided. I hated the issue of slavery, and thank God that slavery was abolished, but it was not the main reason that this war was fought. I believe that if the south had won the war, that slavery would've been abolished within a decade because there was a chance that Lee, who also hated slavery, would've been elected president of the Confederacy. The line &quot;Robert E. Lee, who did not believe in slavery or secession, would end up defending both&quot; enraged me. He was not fighting for slavery OR the confederacy, but fought in defense of his home state of Virginia. If you like an emotional experience, then buy this film.

But stangely, I don't remember really learning anything. Sure, I learned who the Presidents were and who the Generals were, and the names of a battle or two, but I really really FELT it. I never knew the real story. Then, a few years back some of my friends told me about people who lived during the time period (Grant for instance). About the same time, I was told about this documentary by another acquaintance. He went on and on about how great it was. The more I heard about it from various sources the more I wanted to see it. Then, I finally found a copy at the library and watched the whole thing.Wow. I've seen documentaries aplenty over the years, but never ANYTHING like this. This documentary is an absolute tour-de-force of the American Civil War. From the first shots fired to the end and aftermath, everything is covered. Every issue, every confrontation, every bullet and riot seems to come alive. What makes this really unbelievable is the fact that most of the film is told through pictures with voice-overs. How you can feel like you are watching an epic movie when you are really just seeing still pictures really boggles my mind, but it is true.In this documentary you will learn about the people, locations, social forces, culture and beliefs of an entire nation. You will hear about incredible good and bad luck, death and destruction, loyalty and devotion, and sheer madness. I remember a time during my trip through this huge masterpiece when I asked myself &quot;When are Grant and Lee going to meet? They do fight each other in the war don't they?&quot; In reply the documentary ended a section on the mother of all cliff-hangers. A line representing Lee's Army and a Line representing Grant's Army drew closer and closer, and the narrator said that the two unstoppable forces were about to meet in battle for the first time. The tension was incredible. Then I saw the words on the screen that told me the confrontation would be on the next volume...This is not just a great documentary, it is a great work of art and a masterpiece of direction.

Ken Burns documentary presents us with a staggering picture of the good, the bad and the ugly during the greatest conflict our country has ever endured.  I just purchased four copies from Amazon for my adult children for Christmas since my husband and I have so thoroughly enjoyed every episode.  Unlike some documentaries, Ken Burns' Civil War is riveting and informative without being bogged down in the minutia that can put you to sleep no matter how interesting the topic.  The narration by David McCullough is the key element that holds it all together with an extraordinary voice that pulls you in. Interviews with people who have spent their lives studying this great conflict offer insightful and thoughtful opinions and observations which lead to a greater humanization of the story. The interviews with  Shelby Foote were especially notable and enjoyable.  And possibly the most riveting part of this series are the many photographs taken primarily by Mathew Brady, noted photographer of the day.  They are poignant and haunting and bring images you won't soon forget. Also the thoughtfully chosen music throughout (especially the beautiful Ashokan Farewell) makes the experience all the richer.

Ken Burns has certainly succeeded on both counts and he's also set the standard for documentary with this monumental effort on the Civil War. Political, Social and Historical perspectives abound in this boxed set with no equal anywhere in the documentary world, I'd wager. The political climate that started the war gets it's very own tape and is wonderfully told in context with the social atmosphere of the time. The war and all the major battles are overlayed with readings from historical documents/diaries of the time as well as &quot;then and now&quot; pictures and films that set the viewer squarely into those momentous times (the battles at Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh and the Wilderness are wonderful examples of the &quot;then and now&quot; pictures/films...). One of the major selling points of this work is that Burns has managed to keep the flow of the War uppermost in the viewers mind (amazingly through all nine tapes) while still able to digress into the aforementioned social and political issues of the time (slavery, the everyday man and woman's perspective, Abraham Lincoln's administration ...etc.). Finally, with historical discussions with Shelby Foote and narration by David McCullough, Burns has set the bar unattainably high for other documentaries...it simply doesn't get any better than this.

It took longer to make this series than it did for the Civil War to come and go - and it shows. Burns and the enormous amount of people who worked on this series certainly did their research.The story starts in the 1850's, explaining the slavery versus free states issues and concentrating on 'bleeding' Kansas. The catalysts of war are explored, everything from growing disparity between north and south to the redoutable John Brown.Burns then takes us from battle to battle, skirmish to skirmish, switching sides then switching back again. Expert analysis is provided by a number of 'talking head' historians, the best of which is Shelby Foote, who seems to have a genius for making the most ordinary story sound interesting and occasionally comical.And so it goes on. We follow Union and Confederate privates, listen to diary entries from concerned civilians and listen to battle plans being discussed by Generals of both sides. Pertinent facts are fed to the viewers by the deadpan narration. A nice touch is that, although we move from State to State throughout the 4 year war, Burns keeps us in touch with an ordinary soldier from each side, and we therefore have their view of the war from the start right to the very end.The DVD is packed with extras, including a very interesting documentary on making the documentary.

On Disc 1: The Cause, the narrator says:""By 1860, the last year of peace, one out of every seven Americans belonged to another American. Four million men, women and children were slaves.""Immediately following this, a quote by Abraham Lincoln is read:""Whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some transatlantic giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never. All the armies of Europe and Asia could not by force take a drink from  the Ohio river or make a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we will live forever or die by suicide.""-Abraham Lincoln, 1837The documentary presents these two quotes in such a way as to give the impression that Lincoln's quote was about slavery. It was not. The speech which includes these words was a speech entitled, ""Opposition to Mob-Rule,"" given as an address before The Young Men's Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois on January 27, 1837.I'm a stickler about such things. The quote was taken out of context and I don't appreciate that. Due to this, I now feel that I cannot reasonably rely on what is said in the documentary.

289711,AP3B615GM191G,6301996135,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Ken Burns' epic documentary about the Civil War is perhaps the greatest and most all-encompassing history lesson of the North/South conflict that has ever been put on film or page. Not only is every important detail of the war covered (and in such a way that the details are interesting and important, not boring), but two entire episodes are devoted to the build-up and aftermath of the conflict. Essentially, if you were teaching a class on the Civil War, this video is all you would need, as it both conveys the vital information of the war, and does so in a way that doesn't stagnate. In essence, a very tight, well-produced series.The only reason I give this set four stars out of five, though, is that it lacks (althouht through no fault of its own) the emotional punch of Burns' more recent ""The War"" (World War II) series. Such things as personal interviews and live video could obviously not be obtained from the 1860s, but the reading of letters and still photographs doesn't quite measure up. The best example I can give of this is that while watching the Civil War series I found myself treating it as one extended history class session, while ""The War"" was almost more of a dramatic event (what with the live interviews and video footage).So, although the Civil War documentary by Ken Burns is a brilliant work of research and cinematography, I can only give it a four-star rating due to its lacks of live video footage or emotionally moving personal interviews. I do, however, strongly recommend this series to anyone wanting to learn a bit more about the most brutal war in United States history. You may not need the tissue box while watching this series (unlike ""The War""), but I guarantee you will come away with a much more solid understanding of the events that caused, prolonged, and ended the American Civil War.",4,"A Great History Lessons, But Lacks The Emotional Punch Of ""The War""",1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,1834,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'epic', 'documentary', 'Civil', 'War', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'most', 'all-encompassing', 'history', 'lesson', 'North/South', 'conflict', 'ever', 'been', 'put', 'film', 'page', 'Not', 'only', 'important', 'detail', 'war', 'covered', 'such', 'way', 'details', 'are', 'interesting', 'important', 'not', 'boring', 'two', 'entire', 'episodes', 'are', 'devoted', 'build-up', 'aftermath', 'conflict', 'Essentially', 'were', 'teaching', 'class', 'Civil', 'War', 'video', 'would', 'need', 'conveys', 'vital', 'information', 'war', 'so', 'way', ""n't"", 'stagnate', 'essence', 'very', 'tight', 'well-produced', 'series.The', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'set', 'four', 'five', 'though', 'fault', 'own', 'emotional', 'punch', 'Burns', 'more', 'recent', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'series', 'Such', 'things', 'personal', 'interviews', 'live', 'video', 'could', 'obviously', 'not', 'be', 'obtained', '1860s', 'reading', 'letters', 'still', 'photographs', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'best', 'example', 'can', 'give', 'watching', 'Civil', 'War', 'series', 'found', 'treating', 'one', 'extended', 'history', 'class', 'session', 'War', 'was', 'almost', 'more', 'dramatic', 'event', 'what', 'live', 'interviews', 'video', 'footage', '.So', 'Civil', 'War', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'brilliant', 'work', 'research', 'cinematography', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'four-star', 'rating', 'due', 'lacks', 'live', 'video', 'footage', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'personal', 'interviews', 'do', 'however', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'learn', 'bit', 'more', 'most', 'brutal', 'war', 'United', 'States', 'history', 'may', 'not', 'need', 'tissue', 'box', 'watching', 'series', 'War', 'guarantee', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'much', 'more', 'solid', 'understanding', 'events', 'caused', 'prolonged', 'ended', 'American', 'Civil', 'War']",N/A

The use of sound effects with old photos makes the pictures come alive and the color videos of the battlegrounds are impressive. My favorite commentator of this set is Shelby Foote, who hails from the Mississippi Delta. He wrote the book ""The Civil War: A Narrative"". His dry humor and knowledge of the war make his observations always interesting. Don't miss his comments on the bonus disk.I recommend the PBS DVD ""Slavery by Another Name"" released in 2012 as a followup to this set.
