I love storms and I found this an entertaining movie.  You can tell the tornados were computer generated and didn't look like they do in real life, but I'm not a picky person and I still found them to look real enough.  The movie ""Twister"" that everyone is familiar with had more realistic looking tornados, but ""Devil Winds"" is still a great movie.  I liked the characters, the story, etc. Great movie!",5,Great Movie,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,511,"['rented', 'movie', 'Net', 'Flix', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'going', 'buy', 'future', 'love', 'storms', 'found', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'tornados', 'were', 'computer', 'generated', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'do', 'real', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'picky', 'person', 'still', 'found', 'look', 'real', 'enough', 'movie', 'Twister', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'had', 'more', 'realistic', 'looking', 'tornados', 'Devil', 'Winds', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'liked', 'characters', 'story', 'etc', 'Great', 'movie']",N/A

He was heroic and handsome (even with his long locks from Sully days gone).  The rest of the cast was also very good and the story was well written if not the most original.",5,Joe Lando is a hero in this one.,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,308,"['Bought', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'days', 'Sully', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'Medicine', 'woman', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'one', 'was', 'heroic', 'handsome', 'even', 'long', 'locks', 'Sully', 'days', 'gone', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'not', 'most', 'original']",N/A

821321,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0002235PI,Michael Butts,"[17, 20]","DEVIL WINDS is full of all the cliches you expect in this kind of movie:  a tornado expert miscalls a tornado and loses his wife in the process; a buxom up and coming reporter wants to make it to the bigtime; a new viral investigation clinic is built and may be in the path of a horrible twister, but the director vows to keep things going; and the hero has a daughter who blames him for her mother's death and doesn't want anything to do with him.  But still, DEVIL WINDS succeeds due to a pleasant cast and computer-generated tornadoes that are pretty awesome, even if they don't look totally real.  It's a movie and for a lower budgeted film, the fx team does okay.  Joe Lando (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Combustion) does a staunch job as the hero and Baywatch's Nicole Eggert, looking a little heftier and unglamorous than usual, does okay too.

The storyline is very plausible and the CGIs look like a real tornado was happeining.  The chemistry between Pete (Joe) and Julia (Nicole Eggert) could have been explored more, but there is alot of action to make up for it.
