919711,A2SAVTYOEBSNPF,B000A2XC5S,"Alyce In Wonderland ""The Looking Glass""","[5, 5]","The ""Strike Zone"" workout sits right between the easiness of Saffell'sQuickfix - Total Cardio Kickand the challenge of her intermediate/advancedHardcore Kickbox Circuitwith Guillermo Gomez.After ""Quickfix"", this one will challenge you a bit.  But after doing ""Hardcore"", ""Strike Zone"" will feel like a day at the park.  ""Stirke Zone"" is still a good workout for days when you are feeling tired and not up to the faster pace and more complicated combinations that Gomez offers in ""Hardcore"".All in all, ""Stirke Zone"" is a good addition to your kickboxing- aerobic library.  The group who works- out with Janis on the video is lively and the music is upbeat.I would not recommend this DVD if you've never done kickboxing- aerobics before.  Unlike ""Quickfix"", Janis doesn't slow down to teach you how to punch and kick.  (Even in ""Quickfix"" she doesn't really get into proper form, but she teaches you enough so you won't feel lost.)If you want to start kickboxing for the first time, and you are in good shape from working- out regularly, I'd suggest starting withKathy Smith - Kickboxing Workout.  It's got a good steady pace to keep your heart- rate up, while taking the time teach you proper punching and kicking form.  Kathy Smith is the main instructor, but she has a multi- titled kickboxing champion with her.  He gets a side window on your TV screen to teach proper form for every kick and punch.  Once you know the moves, the champ offers an extra kickboxing challenge in the ""choose your workout"" section of the DVD.  It's two combos that will really get you moving.If you are not in shape, but want to get into kickboxing, I'd suggest starting withExtreme Makeover Fitness - Weight Loss Workout for Beginners.  Although there are only a couple boxing moves used in this workout, it will get you into shape so you can move on to the challenging kickboxing DVDs.If you love kickboxing aerobics, and want a bit more challenge in your workout, tryHardcore Kickbox Circuit.",4,Fun easy/intermediate level workout.

This isn't for beginners, but once you are ready for it Strike Zone is a must have for kick boxing lover. What I didn't like was the time break down. She starts with a great 6 min warm up and then goes into cardio routines. They are not difficult to follow and she uses her own brand of weighted gloves. Unfortunately as far as I can tell you can not purchase these anywhere. I use Everlast and they are too big for me and they get entirely too sweaty. The cardio section is about 23 mins long. She then goes into target practice with her own target paddle, also not commercially available as far as I can tell. Even without the paddle or a partner you can get some good practice in. Following this she goes into strength training...This is why I gave this video 4 stars...this part was boring. The cool down is also too slow for my taste. Janis is a great instructor, she makes alot of noise and is encouraging.

919716,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000A2XC5S,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[54, 55]","When I first started doing kickboxing, I had trouble finding kickboxing videos that I really enjoyed.  Some were two hi-low aerobics-oriented, others have lacked fun variations and kick-punch combos, and still others contained too mainly elements I didn't want (eg, the floor work in most Tae Bo videos). However, with Janis Saffell's Kickbox Strike Zone, I may have finally found a near-perfect kickboxing video.  What I liked so much about this workout is that it's pure kickboxing: regardless of whether you're warming up, doing cardio, or focusing on toning, you're always combining punches and kicks. In addition, although the video provides an excellent, sustained cardio workout, there is virtually no jumping, so it is almost completely low impact. Furthermore, the workout is great for those (like myself) who have trouble following complicated choreography, as the moves are very simple: most of the time, you are moving either your upper OR your lower body rather than trying to coordinate both together.  Also, Janis introduces new moves at a slightly slower pace before picking up the intensity.The workout begins with a 5 minute warmup. In this section, you move through slower-paced kicks, knee raises, lunges, and just a few push-ups. Next comes the kickboxing cardio section, which totals about 20 minutes. In this segment, you begin by focusing mainly on punches with a few kicks and knee raises thrown in, but eventually, you concentrate more on kicks, including front, back, side, roundhouse, and hook (which is rarely included in kickboxing videos). Jumping jacks are added inbetween some of the moves, but you can easily substitute marching if you want to keep the workout completely low-impact. The cardio work ends with a few squats to provide additional toning benefits.  The next segment consists of 16 minutes of kickboxing drills. These are performed using a partner who is holding a target; I simply imagined a target, and not having a partner just meant that I repeated each routine to double my workout. I really enjoyed this section, as it provided a great opportunity to intently focus on my form for both my punches and my kicks (there are no combinations in this section). Following the drills, there is an additional 10 minutes of standing toning work, mainly knee lifts and squats combined with punches and kicks. The workout ends with a 5 minute Tai Chi stretch for a total running time of 56 minutes.Although I think that those new to kickboxing would be able to follow along with this workout, I would recommend starting with a more teaching-oriented video (such as Kathy Smith's Kickboxing Workout) and then moving on to this one as soon as you know the basics. However, I find Janis Saffell to be an excellent instructor; she offers great form reminders and models flawless form herself. She and the 8 background exercisers really look like they are enjoying themselves and getting into the workout. They all use 1-lb. weighted gloves during the workout (with the exception of the warmup, drills, and cool-down sections), and I am able keep up fine wearing my own 1-lb. gloves.I'm confident that I will continue to use this video frequently over time to provide me with a great cardio AND toning workout.

I am an avid home workout person for several years and this video kicked my butt (and back from all the hooks and jabs)!  I just recently discovered Janis Saffell and I am so impressed with what a great job she does in cueing and putting together an excellent workout.  I started with her Brand New Butt and More video and added the Hardcore Kickbox, Tai Chi Balanced Workout and Strike Zone.  Strike Zone I felt was the hardest workout and most difficult, being new to kickbox.  I would highly recommend Janis' videos, particularly this one.  Despite my dedication to Minna Lessig's videos, Denise Austin's Personal Training and the Bar Method (all of which I think are great), I really like the results I am seeing in my legs and elsewhere from Janis Saffell.

919729,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B000A2XC5S,Sheri in Reho,"[11, 12]","Kickbox Strikezone includes several segments (these are my names for them, not necessarily what you'll see on the DVD's menu):1.  Kickbox Warm-up (mild kickboxing moves are used to warm up the body and start bringing up the heart rate).2.  Kickbox Cardio (kicks and punches along with boxer shuffle, bob & weave, jumping jacks and such get you sweating and keep the heart rate up).3.  Kickbox Technique (technical instruction on kicking and punching using a paddle and a partner but, if you don't have either, you can follow the 2 solo women and do fine).4.  Kickbox Toning (using kickbox-type moves to tone the legs, hips and buns and work on balance--lots of balancing on one leg while you work muscles of the leg/hip/buns).5.  Kickbox Cool-down (t'ai chi cool-down with breathing and stretching).Pros:1.  Janis really seems to know her stuff when it comes to kickboxing and she has a great amount of passion for it.2.  The toning section is very effective--it's one of those workouts that you feel WHILE you're doing it as well as the next day.  Great buns work.3.  If you find Tae-bo too intense, this is a good kickboxing workout, and you will sweat, but it's not as intense as Tae-bo.  For me, that's a good thing--I like Tae-bo now and then, but find it too intense for a regular gig.4.  I was turned off by the paddle section the first time I did this, because it SEEMED to require equipment and a partner, neither of which I had.  However, on subsequent viewing, I realized that she has two women doing the technical workout without either a paddle OR a partner and I actually didn't feel like I was missing anything by following them vs. the pairs.  I really appreciated that she provided this alternative.Cons:1.  Until you get to the technique (3rd) section, there isn't much/any clear instruction on how to move your body while you're punching (i.e., that punching isn't just about your arms, but involves your whole body).  If you're a beginner, I'd suggest starting with at least a review of the paddle (technique) section before doing the workout.2.  Janis has a good-sized crew of people working out with her, but they're all so jammed together that you never really get to see anyone but the first few people in the front.  Especially for a kickboxing workout, this seemed like REALLY bad planning.  One tall guy toward the back couldn't even extend his kicks because he was too close to the woman in front of him.  Maybe that's the only space Janis could afford, but I would have rather seen less people doing the workout and have them spread out so they could really do (and show) their stuff.3.  This is just a personal preference thing for me--I love punching and don't care for kicking quite as much.  I would have loved this workout to be a bit less focused on kicking, though I understand that it's a lot easier to keep the heart rate up with kicking than it is with punching.  There are times when the kicking goes on too long (again, for my taste).4.  I wish the cardio section was longer.5.  I've edited my review to add this, which only came to light when I didn't do the whole workout for the first time recently.  The cooldown is the only segment of the DVD that isn't available to be chosen from the menu--this is really annoying to people who may not have time to do the whole workout.  You can't even use the ""next segment"" button on your DVD remote to get to it.  You have to go to the last segment before cooldown and fast forward to it, which is a waste of time (when you're limited on time in the first place).
