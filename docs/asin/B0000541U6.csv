566402,A204906HLJ443E,B0000541U6,Chanteuse,"[7, 15]","This could have been a better movie if the filmmaker was not overtly sentimental and nostalgic.  By romanticizing the female characters and the dramatic events that surrounded them, the shifting personal values and murky lines between good and evil got lost.  The characters and the story became one-dimensional.  Maybe that's the best the filmmaker could do to squeeze everything she wanted to address in 120 minutes.My opinion is that every major character in this movie deserves a feature length treatment of his/her own to fully present the conflicted emotions and the choices he/she made under the historical events during a very turbulent time in the Chinese history.The actors are terrific in their craft.  However, the character development is sacrificed due to the time and story line limitation.  The portrayal of President Sun and Commander Chiang was accurate and appropriate.  Among the sisters, Vivian Wu's youngest sister, after she became Mrs. Chiang, is a standout.  It's a pity that the filmmaker can't spend more time on her earlier emotional and character development.  Michelle Yeoh is very consistent through out the whole movie as a practical oldest sister prefers to live in a ""real world"".  Maggie Cheung's middle sister is less sympathetic when she became too idealistic and blindly nationalistic.  Miss Cheung's performance can seem too melodramatic at times.Other than the acting, the production value is below par.  The make-up is very amateur to say the least when the characters aged or in various state of health.  The lighting was even worse.  Maggie Cheung was 5 years older when she made the movie ""In The Mood For Love"" but in Soong Sisters she looked a lot less luminous (during which when she portrayed her character as a young woman).  The lighting was simply unkind to the all the female characters in the movie.  The make-up and lighting seem to be the problems in a lot of Chinese films.  Very rarely the Chinese filmmakers pay close attention to lighting and make-up..In whole the movie looks cheap and hastily made.The DVD quality overall is a big disappointment.  The picture quality is not clear, the sound quality is not crisp, and the subtitle is too small to read unless you are right in front of the TV screen.I'd say unless you are 1. really into the Soong sisters' story, 2. interested in Chinese History through out both world wars, or 3. a fan of any of the actors in the movie, this movie is not a must see or must own.",2,"Could have been, would have been",1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,2474,"['could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'not', 'overtly', 'sentimental', 'nostalgic', 'romanticizing', 'female', 'characters', 'dramatic', 'events', 'surrounded', 'shifting', 'personal', 'values', 'murky', 'lines', 'good', 'evil', 'got', 'lost', 'characters', 'story', 'became', 'one-dimensional', 'Maybe', 'best', 'filmmaker', 'could', 'do', 'squeeze', 'everything', 'wanted', 'address', '120', 'minutes.My', 'opinion', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'feature', 'length', 'treatment', 'own', 'fully', 'present', 'conflicted', 'emotions', 'choices', 'he/she', 'made', 'historical', 'events', 'very', 'turbulent', 'time', 'Chinese', 'history.The', 'actors', 'are', 'terrific', 'craft', 'However', 'character', 'development', 'sacrificed', 'due', 'time', 'story', 'line', 'limitation', 'portrayal', 'President', 'Sun', 'Commander', 'Chiang', 'was', 'accurate', 'appropriate', 'sisters', 'Vivian', 'Wu', 'youngest', 'sister', 'became', 'Mrs.', 'Chiang', 'standout', 'pity', 'filmmaker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'earlier', 'emotional', 'character', 'development', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'very', 'consistent', 'whole', 'movie', 'practical', 'oldest', 'sister', 'prefers', 'live', 'real', 'world', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'middle', 'sister', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'when', 'became', 'too', 'idealistic', 'blindly', 'nationalistic', 'Miss', 'Cheung', 'performance', 'can', 'seem', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'times.Other', 'acting', 'production', 'value', 'par', 'make-up', 'very', 'amateur', 'say', 'least', 'when', 'characters', 'aged', 'various', 'state', 'health', 'lighting', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'was', '5', 'years', 'older', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'Mood', 'Love', 'Soong', 'Sisters', 'looked', 'lot', 'less', 'luminous', 'when', 'portrayed', 'character', 'young', 'woman', 'lighting', 'was', 'simply', 'unkind', 'female', 'characters', 'movie', 'make-up', 'lighting', 'seem', 'be', 'problems', 'lot', 'Chinese', 'films', 'Very', 'rarely', 'Chinese', 'filmmakers', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'lighting', 'make-up..In', 'whole', 'movie', 'cheap', 'hastily', 'made.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'overall', 'big', 'disappointment', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'clear', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'crisp', 'subtitle', 'too', 'small', 'read', 'are', 'right', 'front', 'TV', 'screen.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'are', '1.', 'really', 'Soong', 'sisters', 'story', '2.', 'interested', 'Chinese', 'History', 'world', 'wars', '3.', 'fan', 'actors', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'must', 'see', 'must', 'own']",N/A

Base on accounts of the social upheavals in various points and eras in Chinese history, it is filled with gorgeous cinematography, great score by Kitaro and great cast. Historically accurate if not, a few minor point may be incorrect, but as a whole, it shows you the big picture.With some of the best stars there is from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Maggie Cheung, Michelle Khan and Vivian Wu portrayal as the three sister are excellent. But the most powerful in performance are from the men. Jiang Wen (outspoken Charlie Soong) also a favourite actor of mine, Winston Chou (charismatic Sun Yatsen) and Kuo Chiuwu (commanding Chiang Kaishek) are  powerful and haunting.Despite an 18 minute footage cut from the original, still its a great direction from Mabel Cheung.

566404,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000541U6,Grady Harp,"[14, 14]","THE SOONG SISTERS is a visually stunning recounting of the turns of events that changed China from a land of Dynasties to a nation of multiple personalities: the Nationalist Party, the Revolutionists, and the Communist Party.  As such it fills in many bits of political and social history that by and large have gone unnoticed by the West.  Charlie Soong (having been educated in America) has three special daughters whom he loves so much that he sends them to America for schooling at Wellesley to prepare for what he envisions as a New China. The daughters return to China as young women, marry men who are destined to become important political leaders, and the changes the resulting schism of a Chinese family parallels the cultural transformation of one of the oldest civilizations on the planet.  Director Mabel Cheung has a keen eye for vistas of Oriental splendor, capturing the young girls at play in gardens, marrying in elegantly beautiful ceremonies, joining the 'imported' western culture with the elegance of the Chinese culture in the arts, a fine sense of the seasons (though when it rains in China apparently one cannot hear a normal conversation!), and even the requisite battle scenes that of course must accompany this period of transition (internal battles as well as fighting the invading Japanese army).  For the most part she draws vivid performances from Jiang Wan (a true mixture of East and West) as Charlie Soong, Michelle Yeoh, Vivian Wu and Maggie Cheung as the three Soong sisters, and  Winston Chao as Sun Yat-Sen and Kuo Chiu Wa as Chiang Kai-Shek, two of their husbands.  The drawbacks in this very long movie are the editing (scenes literally bounce off each other in a most distracting non-fusion), sound track (treacly Western sentimentalist gush coupled with the elegance of old Chinese music on ancient instruments), and the lack of passion in the relationships of the people.  Perhaps this is her style: perhaps it is a way of avoiding commitment to any one of the political parties addressed.

I was particularly interested as I had met Soong Mei-ling (Mrs Chiang Kai-shek) when I was about ten, when she was in Britain in about 1942, trying to raise money for her husband's cause.  I later met Soong Ch'ing-ling in a Buddhist Monastery on Lan Tau Island in 1958, and travelled with David Sung on a flight from Malaysia to Hong Kong in 1964.Soong Mei-ling was a very attractive-looking youngish Chinese woman (from my recollection)and the film does justice to her.  Soong Ch'ing-ling was early middle-aged when I met her, and the actor who played David Sung was also a good likeness, although Sung Tzu-wen was somewhat slimmer when I met him.The film reviewed put the story of the family into a cohesive and interesting history of a remarkable family.",4,The Soong Sisters,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,869,"['was', 'previous', 'black', 'white', 'documentary', 'Soong', 'Sisters', 'brother', 'David', 'television', 'was', 'particularly', 'interested', 'had', 'met', 'Soong', 'Mei-ling', 'Mrs', 'Chiang', 'Kai-shek', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'ten', 'when', 'was', 'Britain', 'about', '1942', 'trying', 'raise', 'money', 'husband', 'cause', 'later', 'met', 'Soong', ""Ch'ing-ling"", 'Buddhist', 'Monastery', 'Lan', 'Tau', 'Island', '1958', 'travelled', 'David', 'Sung', 'flight', 'Malaysia', 'Hong', 'Kong', '1964.Soong', 'Mei-ling', 'was', 'very', 'attractive-looking', 'youngish', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'recollection', 'film', 'justice', 'Soong', ""Ch'ing-ling"", 'was', 'early', 'middle-aged', 'when', 'met', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'David', 'Sung', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'likeness', 'Sung', 'Tzu-wen', 'was', 'somewhat', 'slimmer', 'when', 'met', 'him.The', 'film', 'reviewed', 'put', 'story', 'family', 'cohesive', 'interesting', 'history', 'remarkable', 'family']",N/A

It bounces through events that cry out for greater depth. Maybe it would have been better to attempt bite sized portions and make three or four films from the fascinating material.
