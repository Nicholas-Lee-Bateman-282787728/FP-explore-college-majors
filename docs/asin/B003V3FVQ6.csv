1366659,A29RUNZT2H2GCU,B003V3FVQ6,Ann Sherry,"[0, 0]","There is one 23-minute episode of 'Family Guy' on this dvd.  The cover says it is &#34;banned from tv&#34;.  This was released in 2010, and I don't know if since its release it was eventually shown.  I would check the episode titles on any dvds you own in the series to make sure you don't have it already.This show has Lois agreeing to be a surrogate mother for an infertile couple.  Parts are more tasteless than funny.  I'm not sure why this was &#34;banned from tv&#34;, unless it's because it addresses abortion.  With all the stuff this show has gotten away with, I am surprised they banned this.  The baby tries to kill its mother all the time; Meg and Peter drag a dead Stewie (a baby) around with them after he suffers a bloody head wound while in their care; they use 4-letter words and thinly veiled dialogue with double meanings.  Probably most of their shows should be banned.BTW, I am a fan of the show.  I like its creativity and its guts to push things to and over the limit.  But I think it should be kept for late night, not prime time or earlier.There is nothing outstanding about this show.  It's not particularly special to where I have to have it.  I could have easily done without it and not missed anything.  There are some extras:  9 Family Guy songs, animation stuff, a table read of this episode (now that would be good, if it were a different episode), and audio commentary.  If I don't like the show, I'm not gonna care about the audio commentary.One special thing about this dvd they don't mention on the cover is that after you shell out your money for this fairly useless episode, you can always re-sell it to somebody else who's curious about the &#34;banned from tv&#34; hype.",2,Not Endearing,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,1710,"['one', '23-minute', 'episode', ""'Family"", 'Guy', 'dvd', 'cover', '34', 'banned', 'tv', '34', 'was', 'released', '2010', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'release', 'was', 'eventually', 'shown', 'would', 'check', 'episode', 'titles', 'dvds', 'own', 'series', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'already.This', 'show', 'Lois', 'agreeing', 'be', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'infertile', 'couple', 'Parts', 'are', 'more', 'tasteless', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', '34', 'banned', 'tv', '34', 'abortion', 'stuff', 'show', 'gotten', 'away', 'am', 'surprised', 'banned', 'baby', 'kill', 'mother', 'time', 'Meg', 'Peter', 'drag', 'dead', 'Stewie', 'baby', 'bloody', 'head', 'wound', 'care', 'use', '4-letter', 'words', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'dialogue', 'double', 'meanings', 'Probably', 'most', 'shows', 'should', 'be', 'banned.BTW', 'am', 'fan', 'show', 'like', 'creativity', 'guts', 'push', 'things', 'limit', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'late', 'night', 'not', 'prime', 'time', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'show', 'not', 'particularly', 'special', 'where', 'have', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'done', 'not', 'missed', 'anything', 'are', 'extras', '9', 'Family', 'Guy', 'songs', 'animation', 'stuff', 'table', 'read', 'episode', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'were', 'different', 'episode', 'audio', 'commentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'care', 'audio', 'commentary.One', 'special', 'thing', 'dvd', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'cover', 'shell', 'out', 'money', 'fairly', 'useless', 'episode', 'can', 'always', 're-sell', 'somebody', 'else', 'who', 'curious', '34', 'banned', 'tv', '34', 'hype']",N/A

This segement is pretty friggin funny. Anyways, she cannot have a child so asks Lois to carry it for her and she accepts. However, Peter wants her to get an abortion until he sees a rally against abortion. Along the way, the couple dies and Lois doesnt want the kid now and doesnt know what to do with it. That pretty much sums up the entire epsiode for you, all 23 minutes of it. Is it worth it? Peter thinking he is getting a three way is pretty funny. However, I think once Fox pulled the epsiode for airing, Seth could have went back and added at least ten more minutes. The show ends out of nowhere and could have been explained better.Worth it for ten bucks? Yes. If your a fan of the show, it's funny but could have been extended by ten minutes or so.

For the most part Fox has allowed them to do and get away with quite a lot, but occasionally the show has gone farther than the network will allow. The last time it happened was with the largely non-offensive ""When You Wish Upon a Wienstien"". The most recent is with this story, ""Partial Terms of Endearment"".The plot centers around an old college friend of Lois' who wants to have a baby. She and her husband have tried time and again to have one, and just haven't been successful. So they ask if Lois would be willing to act as a surrogate. She agrees and then they die. Lois debates whether or not to have an abortion and hilarity ensues!Now this isn't the best or funniest ""Family Guy"" episode ever made, but it is a very good episode, and one that I feel should have probably aired with a disclaimer in front. There's not really much here that's terribly offensive, but there's a lot that's very funny (especially Peter's belief that Lois' friend wants a threesome with him and Lois).I understand why people have a problem with there being only one episode on this disc, but that episode does have commentary. Plus you get many extras, including some downloadable songs, an animatic (should you care about such things), and ""Family Guy Presents: Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show"".

1366675,AD3EX5UG7UZPB,B003V3FVQ6,"Marcos ""proletariat""","[0, 0]","I have to echo the words of another reviewer by saying that it is reasonable to buy this if you are a die hard fan, as you will naturally want all the episodes in your collection, but this is not worth the purchase... Granted, it has bonus material, but this is ONE mediocre episode that should have been included on one of the ""volume"" box sets. This is clearly another instance of the consumer/fan being taken advantage of. I don't know about other fans, but I'm tired of getting ripped off, but what else should I expect from FOX or any other network for that matter. They initially did not screen this on television because FOX found it too controversial of an episode, which is ridiculous because it contains nothing more contentious or subversive than anything else aired on prime time network television. What better a way to justify packaging it in its own ""Banned from TV"" DVD. I don't know if that was there plan all along, but either way it is consumer exploitation. The argument to that can certainly be ""don't buy it then!"" 1st of all that still doesn't make it right, and 2nd like I said, naturally die hard fans want every episode, and the fans are what makes a show money, so you don't take a giant crap on them by releasing single episode dvds... oh, but wait, I forgot, we're talking about FOX here.with regards to reviewing the actual content...The episode itself poses somewhat of a reasonable argument, albeit nothing that new except for the situation that was its framework (the surrogacy issue)...  and it is also rather one sided... As far as that goes, I think Family Guy is usually right on in its political critiques (although Brian [who seems to echo Seth MacFarlane and the other writers of the show] can be a very typical, branded liberal i.e. ""I'm a liberal, so I have to follow each and every liberal agenda according to the dems and the liberal media""). While I am also generally liberal in matters of social liberties (and with regards to abortion I am POLITICALLY pro choice, that is to say, I am against illegalizing abortion for plenty of reasons, the biggest being that it is too gray of an ethical area for the government to tell us what we can decide when it comes to abortion, and the other biggest reason being that if it was illegal it would only cause more problems... back alley abortionists, etc.), however for myself in matters of NORMAL pregnancies where there isn't a MEDICAL issue (ectopic pregnancies, etc.) or another issue like rape or incest, I am ETHICALLY pro life: i.e. I feel it is unethical to abort a baby if it is a healthy, normal pregnancy, however, if an abortion IS performed in a reasonable amount of time, the government should still have no say in it... so few people make this political / ethical distinction in this matter but I do. This episode fails to make that distinction or provide any other real argument other than its own, which really offers nothing new that we haven't heard already from the liberal end of the debate... I do like that it poses a situation that most people would not think about when discussing the topic... back to discussing the framework... albeit a relatively far fetched situation that is [attn: SPOILER] , which is the parents BOTH die while their surrogate is pregnant. For me because I'm politically pro choice it is a no brainer when it comes to the LEGAL issue, (although I do have my own personal thoughts on how long you should be allowed to choose abortion regardless of the situation... a fully formed baby that is almost to term that is aborted even in this situation is a lot more clear to be along the lines of murder than a terminated pregnancy after 5 weeks), but the ethical end in a case like this is a lot more complex... as previously implied... how far along was Lois when the parents died? What were the other terms of the surrogacy agreement? None of these types of questions were addressed, and while I don't expect them all to be in a 22 minute show, and to be fair it gets people talking by leaving such questions unanswered, but I do feel like if you take on something like this, do it justice, but unfortunately all this episode is was Family Guy writers saying ""HEY, BTW, WE'RE PRO CHOICE!"" (which we already knew) in a semi clever way, and to boot, not really being that funny about it either... i found this episode to be pretty stingy on the humor, which is naturally disappointing because its family guy. It wasn't less funny because it was a serious topic but simply lacked in that department as some of the other more recent FG episodes also have.So, it is just a mediocre piece altogether, a whole other reason not to buy this, but it gets people talking at the very least--- I just like to see more intelligent discussion then we're used to seeing when it comes to this complicated moral issue.",2,Mediocre episode at best and a consumer rip off to boot,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,4832,"['have', 'echo', 'words', 'reviewer', 'saying', 'reasonable', 'buy', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan',

The worst part is it's such a waste of a disc.  To go through the act of retrieving the disc and putting it in your DVD player, you expect more content.  I just can't get over that: 1 episode on 1 whole disc.  Such a waste.  And the excuse for this cash grab?  ""Well, it's a controversial episode that Fox wouldn't air so we're releasing it so the fans can have it.""  O.k., why not put it on  the next Family Guy volume?  Who cares if it is controversial?  It still gets put out on DVD just the same here.  Why not make it easier?  They already set precedence for this by releasing the last controversial FG episode that was ""too hot for TV"" (Wish upon a Weinstein) on volume 2.  I am already annoyed that recent volumes contain far fewer episodes per disc than in the past (disc 3 from Vol. 6 contained one episode).  Accepting the fact that volume sets will never have more than 15 episodes, they had it perfect on Volume 5: all the episodes split between 2 discs and all the bonus features on the 3rd disc.  Partial Terms of Endearment is a total waste-of-space.I am giving it 3 stars due to the fact, in terms of actual value here, there is quite a bit of content.  The Family Guy cast and creators reenacting the whole episode live, commentary on the episode, and the whole episode of the Seth and Alex live action comedy special is included.  There is also an animatic of the whole episode which includes some jokes not seen in the finished product.So all-in-all, you do get a decent amount of content for what you pay, it still doesn't save the fact that the ""main feature"" is 22 minutes long.  If you have a multi-disc player, it's a waste of a spot in your player.

The special features are decent though, with a great commentary from Seth MacFarlane and crew, and the live table read with the voice cast is worth checking this DVD out for alone.",4,"Not bad, but not worth the full price",1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,753,"['Garnering', 'bit', 'controversy', 'leading', 'Fox', 'pull', 'airing', 'Partial', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'quite', 'funny', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', 'more', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fans', 'show', 'However', 'laying', 'down', 'full', 'list', 'price', 'DVD', 'practically', 'highway', 'robbery', 'more', 'so', 'considering', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'included', 'eventual', 'box', 'set', 'release', 'being', 'said', 'watching', 'episode', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'why', 'Fox', 'decided', 'not', 'air', 'nowhere', 'near', 'controversial', 'apalling', 'offensive', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'be', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'decent', 'great', 'commentary', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'crew', 'live', 'table', 'read', 'voice', 'cast', 'worth', 'checking', 'DVD', 'out', 'alone']",N/A

Although not a perfect episode of Family Guy, this episode features some of the best material that the show has put out since its premature cancellation. Naturally, the conservative neo-nazis known as News Corp refused to air this fantastic episode on their network, because of the political heat that still surrounds ABORTION. So, they banned it from airing on their network, and instead, they are going to profit off of it on DVD. NOW THAT'S ETHICAL! As a Family Guy episode, I was glad to see some of the episode return to the show's original roots. It's also an episode that takes a more political approach like South Park, and actually gets it right. It may also be one of the funniest Family Guy episodes in recent history. Even though the release is unnecessary, (it should of just been included with the boxsets released with the series), a Family Guy fan will not be disappointed by Partial Terms of Endearment. It is some of the best work from Seth and gang, and dare I say it: One of the best episodes of the series.",4,"Some of the show's best material, but an unnecessary DVD release",1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,1092,"['Note', 'rating', 'feature', 'episode', 'only', 'not', 'perfect', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', 'episode', 'best', 'material', 'show', 'put', 'out', 'premature', 'cancellation', 'Naturally', 'conservative', 'neo-nazis', 'known', 'News', 'Corp', 'refused', 'air', 'fantastic', 'episode', 'network', 'political', 'heat', 'still', 'ABORTION', 'So', 'banned', 'airing', 'network', 'instead', 'are', 'going', 'profit', 'DVD', 'NOW', 'THAT', 'ETHICAL', 'Family', 'Guy', 'episode', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'episode', 'return', 'show', 'original', 'roots', 'also', 'episode', 'more', 'political', 'approach', 'South', 'Park', 'actually', 'right', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'Family', 'Guy', 'episodes', 'recent', 'history', 'Even', 'release', 'unnecessary', 'should', 'just', 'been', 'included', 'boxsets', 'released', 'series', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fan', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Partial', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'best', 'work', 'Seth', 'gang', 'dare', 'say', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'series']",N/A
1366686,A194GQYVY9HXUP,B003V3FVQ6,Ray-Review,"[3, 4]","I am a huge fan of Family Guy. I keep up with all the new episodes and I own all the DVD's/Blu-Ray releases that came out. The show has been noted for its controversy and such, but its an animated comedy show so what do you expect. This episode ""Partial Terms of Endearment"" is a banned episode about having an abortion, this is officially the second Family Guy episode that has been banned by FOX. However, the first episode that was banned was called ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein"" actually is broadcasted on TV right now so I have no doubt in my mind this episode will be released on television in the future.This DVD release contains the one episode with special features including commentary on the episode, Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show (which is funny as hell) and a table read. This DVD cost $9.99 but in actuallity it should be worth $4.99 or even $7.99 but thats still too costly. This is just another jackass move to make more money which is gonna work thanks to the hardcore fans. They should have just put this episode on the next Family Guy Volume instead of doing this unnecessary relase.

As other reviewers note, this is an average episode of ""Family Guy"" churned out with the hype specifically to wring another ten bucks out of the fans. It's okay, a couple of funny points, but nothing (again, as noted by others) that will still be banned from the air a year from now, if that is, in case the fact. I somewhat wonder whether a one minute snippet got a resounding ""No!"" by the powers that be, and Seth and Crew took that and ran with it. I read once that Elvis came through in a seance (stick with me, making a point), and asked the participants to track Colonel Parker down and ask just one thing: ""When is too much money enough?"" (Apparently, Elvis was distressed at the singing plates and glittering pot holders recently licensed).
