This movie gives us Disney's perspective on the Revolution, nothing more or less.  For people wanting to learn history by watching movies this may be a shocker: movies are meant to entertain us, not educate us.  God deliver us from Preacher-Directors who use their director's chairs as pulpits.  All historical movies have some inaccuracies and most have many; even the acclaimed John Adams miniseries had several.  Even today's history textbooks are suspect.  The best way to learn history is to read the biographies of those who made it.  Read Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin and others in their own words.  You can learn a lot about people and events by reading good biographies and autobiographies.If you love America and want to share and pass on that legacy to your children, then I would recommend this movie to you.

Briggs ""MusicDr""","[1, 1]","When watching this film way back in 1956, and again many years later, I thoroughly enjoyed it because it fit very well with my historical interests, and there were not many good films about the Revolutionary War era out there.  Even nowadays, there are still very few that do the history of the war any real justice.  Mel Gibson's &#34;Patriot&#34; is an exception, and some good people who criticized that great film for its &#34;historical inconsistencies&#34; were themselves off base, for the most part.  However, and returning to Johnny Tremain, those who have similarly criticized this good film for some of the same reasons are missing the &#34;critique boat.&#34;  The film is &#34;based on&#34; the book of the same name, and those who directed, produced, and acted in the movies brought it to the public for entertainment purposes and not for a bona fide history lesson.  I am a history professor who not only studied, wrote about, and performed in war, but who enjoys even fictional accounts of such struggles, and I do not become paranoid when war-based films depart from original scripts for the purpose of providing entertainment.  As it was written for this film, the story is excellent in many ways, though not necessarily a &#34;classic&#34; in the true sense, but it does provide a very touching story of the time, with some excellent actors demonstrating their considerable skills.",4,An excellent adventure film from the Revolutionary War period,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,1400,"['When', 'watching', 'film', 'way', 'back', '1956', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'historical', 'interests', 'were', 'not', 'many', 'good', 'films', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'era', 'there', 'Even', 'nowadays', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'few', 'do', 'history', 'war', 'real', 'justice', 'Mel', 'Gibson', '34', 'Patriot', '34', 'exception', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'criticized', 'great', 'film', '34', 'historical', 'inconsistencies', '34', 'were', 'off', 'base', 'most', 'part', 'However', 'returning', 'Johnny', 'Tremain', 'who', 'have', 'similarly', 'criticized', 'good', 'film', 'same', 'reasons', 'are', 'missing', '34', 'critique', 'boat.', '34', 'film', '34', 'based', '34', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'who', 'directed', 'produced', 'acted', 'movies', 'brought', 'public', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'not', 'bona', 'fide', 'history', 'lesson', 'am', 'history', 'professor', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'studied', 'wrote', 'performed', 'war', 'who', 'even', 'fictional', 'accounts', 'such', 'struggles', 'do', 'not', 'become', 'paranoid', 'when', 'war-based', 'films', 'depart', 'original', 'scripts', 'purpose', 'providing', 'entertainment', 'was', 'written', 'film', 'story', 'excellent', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'necessarily', '34', 'classic', '34', 'true', 'sense', 'provide', 'very', 'touching', 'story', 'time', 'excellent', 'actors', 'demonstrating', 'considerable', 'skills']",Johnny Tremain VHS

Young Hal Stalmaster plays Johnny, who is the son of a rich aristocratic woman who dies, leaving her son a sterling silver cup with the engraving LYTE on it.  Johnny Lyte Tremain is secretly the heir to an English noble family of great wealth.  As the story unfolds, he's caught up in the early stages of the coming American Revolution, with the Boston Tea Party and the Ride of Paul Revere to be played out with great performances by all.  This movie was made for tv, however, plays as a theater release.  The dvd transfer has some glitches and the color is not as vibrant as it should be.

Johnny's whole purpose in life is to try to become the best silversmith possible.  Johnny is quite diligent in becoming a good silversmith.  Barely perceptible to Johnny, at first, there are activities around Johnny that are leading to a confrontation between the colonies in America and English soldiers.  The confrontation will spark a battle that will eventually lead to the founding of the United States of America.Johnny Tremain believes he can do more, if only his master Ephraim Lapham (character actor Will Wright, who appeared in nearly 200 films and television shows) would trust him.  While trying to prove his ability, Johnny accidentally burns his hand.  The skin on his fingers grows together and Johnny is no longer able to be an apprentice to Ephraim Lapham.Johnny goes to a wealthy man, Jonathan Lyte, for assistance.  Johnny's mother told him that Mr. Lyte (Sebastian Cabot, ""Family Affair,"" ""Winnie the Pooh"" and dozens of other movie and television appearances) was a relative.  Of course Mr. Lyte considers Johnny a scam artist trying to blackmail him for money, and Mr. Lyte accuses Johnny of being a thief.  Famed attorney Josiah Quincy (Whit Bissell, famous character actor who appeared in more than 275 movies and television episodes) represents Johnny Tremain free of charge, and Johnny's life changes forever.While Johnny is going through his travails, historic events are in progress around him.  Initially Johnny refuses to participate in these events because he believes that if he does his job and becomes a good silversmith then his life will be fine.  Johnny believes the people working against the Crown are foolish.  However, Johnny's tragic accident gives Johnny a new perspective.Johnny finds work in a print shop that produces The Boston Observer, where Johnny gets a front seat to the events leading up to the American Revolution.  As Johnny becomes more enamored of the concept of liberty and has a greater appreciation for the meaning of liberty, he becomes more involved in the cause.  Johnny meets many of the important men leading the cause, including Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, and James Otis.  Eventually Dr. Joseph Warren frees the fingers of Johnny's hand and Johnny is able to participate more directly in the activities of the Sons of Liberty.A shipment of tea has arrived in Boston with a tax imposed on England, a tax that the colonists did not approve.  After appealing to the governor of the colony, and losing, the colonists show their disapproval by dumping the tea into Boston harbor, the famed ""Boston Tea Party.""  The movie continues onward to the events at Lexington and Concord and concludes shortly thereafter.This movie is a relatively sanitized version of the events leading to the American Revolution.  The characters are generally larger than life, and many of the grittier details are glossed over.  What remains is the story of a group of people who have the goal of gaining representation for the Colonies.  The movie does portray the Colonists as having pure motives and being paragons of virtue, and most of the English are relatively heartless with only profit as their goal.  Of course these are stereotypes and the truth was much more complex, but the simplicity of the movie reflects on the style of story-telling in the 1950's.The movie does show people being shot, though in a relatively benign way; i.e., they fall over, though sometimes dramatically.  Because of these scenes, this Disney movie may not be suitable for very young family members, perhaps younger than 6 or 7 years old.  However, everyone else will find this reminder of the roots of American independence to be interesting and enjoyable.Enjoy!",4,Family Friendly Version of the Events Leading to the Revolutionary War,1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,3759,"['Jonathan', 'Lyte', 'Tremain', 'apprentice', 'silversmith', 'Boston', '1773', 'Johnny', 'whole', 'purpose', 'life', 'try', 'become', 'best', 'silversmith', 'possible', 'Johnny', 'quite', 'diligent', 'becoming', 'good', 'silversmith', 'Barely', 'perceptible', 'Johnny', 'first', 'are', 'activities', 'Johnny', 'are', 'leading', 'confrontation', 'colonies', 'America', 'English', 'soldiers', 'confrontation', 'will', 'spark', 'battle', 'will', 'eventually', 'lead', 'founding', 'United', 'States', 'America.Johnny', 'Tremain', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'only', 'master', 'Ephraim', 'Lapham', 'character', 'actor', 'Will', 'Wright', 'who', 'appeared', 'nearly', '200', 'films', 'television', 'shows', 'would', 'trust', 'trying', 'prove', 'ability', 'Johnny', 'accidentally', 'hand', 'skin', 'fingers', 'together', 'Johnny', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'be', 'apprentice', 'Ephraim', 'Lapham.Johnny', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Jonathan', 'Lyte', 'assistance', 'Johnny', 'mother', 'told', 'Mr.', 'Lyte', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'Family', 'Affair', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'dozens', 'other', 'movie', 'television', 'appearances', 'was', 'relative', 'course', 'Mr.', 'Lyte', 'Johnny', 'scam', 'artist', 'trying', 'blackmail', 'money', 'Mr.', 'Lyte', 'Johnny', 'being', 'thief', 'Famed', 'attorney', 'Josiah', 'Quincy', 'Whit', 'Bissell', 'famous', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'appeared', 'more', '275', 'movies', 'television', 'episodes', 'Johnny', 'Tremain', 'free', 'charge', 'Johnny', 'life', 'changes', 'forever.While', 'Johnny', 'going', 'travails', 'historic', 'events', 'are', 'progress', 'Initially', 'Johnny', 'participate', 'events', 'job', 'good', 'silversmith', 'then', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'Johnny', 'people', 'working', 'Crown', 'are', 'foolish', 'However', 'Johnny', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Johnny', 'new', 'perspective.Johnny', 'work', 'print', 'shop', 'Boston', 'Observer', 'where', 'Johnny', 'front', 'seat', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Johnny', 'more', 'enamored', 'concept', 'liberty', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'meaning', 'liberty', 'more', 'involved', 'cause', 'Johnny', 'many', 'important', 'men', 'leading', 'cause', 'including', 'Paul', 'Revere', 'Samuel', 'Adams', 'James', 'Otis', 'Eventually', 'Dr.', 'Joseph', 'Warren', 'fingers', 'Johnny', 'hand', 'Johnny', 'able', 'participate', 'more', 'directly', 'activities', 'Sons', 'Liberty.A', 'shipment', 'tea', 'arrived', 'Boston', 'tax', 'imposed', 'England', 'tax', 'colonists', 'did', 'not', 'approve', 'appealing', 'governor', 'colony', 'losing', 'colonists', 'show', 'disapproval', 'dumping', 'tea', 'Boston', 'harbor', 'famed', 'Boston', 'Tea', 'Party', 'movie', 'onward', 'events', 'Lexington', 'Concord', 'shortly', 'thereafter.This', 'movie', 'relatively', 'sanitized', 'version', 'events', 'leading', 'American', 'Revolution', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'larger', 'life', 'many', 'grittier', 'details', 'are', 'glossed', 'What', 'story', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'goal', 'gaining', 'representation', 'Colonies', 'movie', 'portray', 'Colonists', 'having', 'pure', 'motives', 'being', 'paragons', 'virtue', 'most', 'English', 'are', 'relatively', 'heartless', 'only', 'profit', 'goal', 'course', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'truth', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'simplicity', 'movie', 'style', 'story-telling', ""1950's.The"", 'movie', 'show', 'people', 'being', 'shot', 'though', 'relatively', 'benign', 'way', 'i.e.', 'fall', 'sometimes', 'dramatically', 'scenes', 'Disney', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'very', 'young', 'family', 'members', 'perhaps', 'younger', '6', '7', 'years', 'old', 'However', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'find', 'reminder', 'roots', 'American', 'independence', 'be', 'interesting', 'enjoyable.Enjoy']",Johnny Tremain VHS

When his master is offered a job that is too difficult for his aged skills, Johnny jumps at the opportunity to prove himself to the important customer, Mr. Lyte. But with the job, a deadline is also given, and to do the work in time, Johnny finds himself, along with his master's wife and daughter, breaking the law by working on a Sunday. While pouring molten silver under panicked conditions, Johnny is pushed into it and his right hand is badly burned.Time passes, and Johnny must unwrap his burned fingers and get back to the work he is bound to do, but upon discovering that his fingers have healed and grown together, making his hand somewhat useless, he is cast out into the street to find a new home. But no one will hire a boy with one good hand, when there are plenty to be had with two. Johnny soon finds himself desperate, and goes to the home of rich Mr. Lyte, to share his long kept secret, that he is actually named Jonathan Lyte Tremain. Johnny has never told anyone other than the silversmith's beautiful daughter, Cilla, that he was the unknown nephew of Mr. Lyte, but now he has no choice. But when he speaks to the man, he is accused of trying to con him, and Johnny soon finds himself the defendant in a trial that could send him to the gallows. Luckily, Johnny has befriended some important people in his search for work, such as the Patriots Josiah Quincy and Paul Revere, among others. They work to free Johnny, and with the help of Cilla's testimony, the boy soon finds himself cleared and working as a horse messenger boy for the local band of Patriots. A cause that Johnny once found rather trivial, becomes his new passion, and Johnny soon finds himself taking part in secret meetings, the Boston Tea Party, and some famous battles that kicked off the War for Independence.Johnny Tremain is a Disney classic from that very special time period at the studios. The film is inspirational, fun, and fit for all ages. True, it's waaaaay more family friendly than the novel, but to me that's just fine.

418791,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6304400810,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[11, 12]","As a child, I would go to Colonial Williamsburg nearly every year on school breaks. I adored anything having to do with colonial history, and fell in love with Johnny Tremain (book first, then movie) instantly. Esther Forbes' classic novel tells the rousing tale of a haughty Boston silversmith's apprentice, Johnny Tremain, who, when maimed in an accident with molten silver, gives up his apprenticeship, hits all new lows as he is turned down for jobs because of his deformed hand, and is accused of theft by one of Boston's elite. He matures from boy to man as he joins up with the Sons of Liberty and participates in the planning of the American Revolution (along with some of colonial Boston's most brilliant minds).Disney's 1957 film adaptation starring Hal Stalmaster was made for TV but also shown in theaters. The costumes, music, and sets are fairly convincing at portraying colonial Boston. The film, at 81 minutes, cuts out a lot of backstory regarding Johnny's inner process of maturation and changes a crucial plot point near the end (presumably to make the film more child-friendly), but generally remains faithful to the spirit of the original book. The transfer is generally very clean and crisp, amazing for a movie of this age.Amazingly, we actually saw an old reel copy of Johnny Tremain in my fifth grade class ( this was in the early 1990s), and until now, the only copy I owned was a disintegrating VHS tape that'd I'd recorded from the Disney Channel. The DVD release features wonderful extras: Walt Disney talking about the making of the film, and the introductions that were played with each part (the original film was divided into two episodes), basically shameless marketing for other Disney films and a Liberty Square theme park experiment that never came to fruition, but fascinating nonetheless that these extras were saved and presented with the film. The only disappointment is that the excellent animated short ""Ben and Me,"" about a mouse who shares a home with Benjamin Franklin, wasn't included (it's referenced in the two segments, but has never been released to DVD).A great little family film for history buffs and a real treat those who grew up on classic 1950's Disney live-action fare (Swamp Fox, Spin and Marty, Davy Crockett).",5,Family-friendly faithful adaptation of Esther Forbes' classic as good as I remember from childhood!,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2271,"['child', 'would', 'go', 'Colonial', 'Williamsburg', 'nearly', 'year', 'school', 'breaks', 'adored', 'anything', 'having', 'do', 'colonial', 'history', 'fell', 'love', 'Johnny', 'Tremain', 'book', 'first', 'then', 'movie', 'instantly', 'Esther', 'Forbes', 'classic', 'novel', 'rousing', 'tale', 'haughty', 'Boston', 'silversmith', 'apprentice', 'Johnny', 'Tremain', 'who', 'when', 'maimed', 'accident', 'molten', 'silver', 'up', 'apprenticeship', 'new', 'lows', 'turned', 'down', 'jobs', 'deformed', 'hand', 'accused', 'theft', 'one', 'Boston', 'elite', 'boy', 'man', 'up', 'Sons', 'Liberty', 'participates', 'planning', 'American', 'Revolution', 'colonial', 'Boston', 'most', 'brilliant', 'minds', '.Disney', '1957', 'film', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Hal', 'Stalmaster', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'also', 'shown', 'theaters', 'costumes', 'music', 'sets', 'are', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'portraying', 'colonial', 'Boston', 'film', '81', 'minutes', 'out', 'lot', 'backstory', 'regarding', 'Johnny', 'inner', 'process', 'maturation', 'crucial', 'plot', 'point', 'end', 'presumably', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'child-friendly', 'generally', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'original', 'book', 'transfer', 'generally', 'very', 'clean', 'crisp', 'amazing', 'movie', 'age.Amazingly', 'actually', 'saw', 'old', 'reel', 'copy', 'Johnny', 'Tremain', 'fifth', 'grade', 'class', 'was', 'early', '1990s', 'now', 'only', 'copy', 'owned', 'was', 'disintegrating', 'VHS', 'tape', ""'d"", ""'d"", 'recorded', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'DVD', 'release', 'wonderful', 'extras', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'talking', 'making', 'film', 'introductions', 'were', 'played', 'part', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'divided', 'two', 'episodes', 'basically', 'shameless', 'marketing', 'other', 'Disney', 'films', 'Liberty', 'Square', 'theme', 'park', 'experiment', 'never', 'came', 'fruition', 'fascinating', 'nonetheless', 'extras', 'were', 'saved', 'presented', 'film', 'only', 'disappointment', 'excellent', 'animated', 'short', 'Ben', 'Me', 'mouse', 'who', 'shares', 'home', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'referenced', 'two', 'segments', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'great', 'little', 'family', 'film', 'history', 'buffs', 'real', 'treat', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'classic', '1950', 'Disney', 'live-action', 'fare', 'Swamp', 'Fox', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'Davy', 'Crockett']",Johnny Tremain VHS

I have not yet read the book, although I added it to my  shopping cart this evening, so I cannot comment on its accuracy in that  regard.  However, it had a message that my 10-year-old daughter could  understand.  The Revolutionary War was not about tea or soldiers or guns,  but about the principle that a small body of men completely absent from the  people they govern should have such absolute control over the lives of  large numbers of people.  Early in the movie Tremain feels the resistance  to the tea tax is much ado about nothing, then later realizes the larger  picture.  I get much the same reaction today from people as I point out the  unconstitutional laws being passed by our own lawmakers.

With kids' short attention spans these days, this movie is  an excellent vehicle for exposing them to the concept of fighting for  principle over profit - a value the upcoming generation needs to learn.",4,Give young viewers a glimpse of the original ideals,963100800,"07 9, 2000",2000,1259,"['remembered', 'movie', 'childhood', 'desire', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'stirred', 'current', 'patriotic', 'fever', 'generated', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'latest', 'showing', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'book', 'added', 'shopping', 'cart', 'evening', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'accuracy', 'regard', 'However', 'had', 'message', '10-year-old', 'daughter', 'could', 'understand', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'was', 'not', 'tea', 'soldiers', 'guns', 'principle', 'small', 'body', 'men', 'completely', 'absent', 'people', 'govern', 'should', 'have', 'such', 'absolute', 'control', 'lives', 'large', 'numbers', 'people', 'Early', 'movie', 'Tremain', 'resistance', 'tea', 'tax', 'much', 'ado', 'nothing', 'then', 'later', 'larger', 'picture', 'get', 'much', 'same', 'reaction', 'today', 'people', 'point', 'out', 'unconstitutional', 'laws', 'being', 'passed', 'own', 'lawmakers', 'As', 'long', 'people', 'general', 'have', 'microwave', 'ovens', 'DVD', 'players', 'care', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'law', 'land', 'mangled', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'swore', 'uphold', 'protect', 'kids', 'short', 'attention', 'days', 'movie', 'excellent', 'vehicle', 'exposing', 'concept', 'fighting', 'principle', 'profit', 'value', 'upcoming', 'generation', 'needs', 'learn']",Johnny Tremain VHS

The characters are well developed, in the context of the story. I am especially impressed with its portrayal of James Otis, a founding member of the Sons of Liberty and the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence. It was Otis who first wrote &#34;Taxation without representation is tyranny&#34;. He was the victim of a head injury, which led to spells of violence and inhibited his conduct of business.Mr. Otis is often overlooked in our views of the rebellion in Boston and its environs, in favor of Dr. Joseph Warren, Samuel Adams, and Paul Revere, but here he is given his due.  The story follows a young apprentice, with a kind, though strict, master, through his apprenticeship as a silversmith and as a patriot. You may also recognize Richard Beymer, who is probably best remembered as Tony in the film version of West Side Story.",5,Nostalgic look at US History,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,942,"['film', 'was', 'product', 'Cold', 'War', 'lessons', 'rebelling', 'defense', 'liberty', 'are', 'strong', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'context', 'story', 'am', 'especially', 'impressed', 'portrayal', 'James', 'Otis', 'founding', 'member', 'Sons', 'Liberty', 'Massachusetts', 'Committee', 'Correspondence', 'was', 'Otis', 'who', 'first', 'wrote', '34', 'Taxation', 'representation', 'tyranny', '34', 'was', 'victim', 'head', 'injury', 'led', 'spells', 'violence', 'inhibited', 'conduct', 'business.Mr', 'Otis', 'often', 'overlooked', 'views', 'rebellion', 'Boston', 'environs', 'favor', 'Dr.', 'Joseph', 'Warren', 'Samuel', 'Adams', 'Paul', 'Revere', 'here', 'given', 'due', 'story', 'young', 'apprentice', 'kind', 'strict', 'master', 'apprenticeship', 'silversmith', 'patriot', 'may', 'also', 'recognize', 'Richard', 'Beymer', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'Tony', 'film', 'version', 'West', 'Side', 'Story']",Johnny Tremain VHS

The movie is an adaptation of the Newbery Award winning historical novel Johnny Tremain which is set during the American Revolution. The movie is okay but not at the exceptional level one generally thinks of for a Disney movie. The highlight of the DVD is Walt Disney talking about human freedom in the Special Feature The Making of Johnny Tremain and Introduction to the movie. As a possible alternative around Independence day would recommend the PBS documentary American Experience John and Abigail Adams which also covers this period.,4,Not the best Introduction to the American Revolution,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,636,"['Had', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'introducing', 'American', 'Revolution', 'entertaining', 'way', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Newbery', 'Award', 'winning', 'historical', 'novel', 'Johnny', 'Tremain', 'set', 'American', 'Revolution', 'movie', 'okay', 'not', 'exceptional', 'level', 'one', 'generally', 'Disney', 'movie', 'highlight', 'DVD', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'talking', 'human', 'freedom', 'Special', 'Feature', 'Making', 'Johnny', 'Tremain', 'Introduction', 'movie', 'possible', 'alternative', 'Independence', 'day', 'would', 'recommend', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'American', 'Experience', 'John', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'also', 'period']",Johnny Tremain VHS
