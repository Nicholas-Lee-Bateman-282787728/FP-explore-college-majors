Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[16, 18]","My 2-3 year old girl adores this DVD, she loves ponys at the moment and My little Pony Princess Promenade seems to be the only thing she wants to see - even my 4 year old likes it.There are three stories in one, in ponyville they have discovered a dragon called Spike under the castle - Wysteria has picked the flower he was growing and so she is now the Princess of Ponyville and spike must protect her - or course thereis nothing to protect her from.Then there is the Princess Promenade - a spring parade where all the ponys build floats.Finally there is the Birthday where all the pony's make a charm for a charm bracelet (all dependent on the colour and type of pony they are of course.Kind of innocuous fun - there are songs on it which my girls enjoy. The plot is not at all complex - and although I don't know if the girls really understand the plot anyway, they enjoy the colour, the songs, the simple animation and the simple set up scenes.As an adult I don't really enjoy this, it is just too innocuous. There is little in here to really enjoy, however if my kids were rating this it would be a solid 5 - for me it is a 3 - they like it, I find it too unstructured and badly written, badly voiced to be a really good movie which we will enjoy for years.",3,"Brighly coloured, simple story - some nice songs",1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,1263,"['2-3', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'DVD', 'ponys', 'moment', 'My', 'little', 'Pony', 'Princess', 'Promenade', 'be', 'only', 'thing', 'see', 'even', '4', 'year', 'old', 'likes', 'are', 'three', 'stories', 'one', 'ponyville', 'have', 'discovered', 'dragon', 'called', 'Spike', 'castle', 'Wysteria', 'picked', 'flower', 'was', 'growing', 'so', 'now', 'Princess', 'Ponyville', 'spike', 'must', 'protect', 'course', 'thereis', 'nothing', 'protect', 'from.Then', 'Princess', 'Promenade', 'spring', 'parade', 'where', 'ponys', 'build', 'floats.Finally', 'Birthday', 'where', 'pony', 'make', 'charm', 'charm', 'bracelet', 'dependent', 'colour', 'type', 'pony', 'are', 'course.Kind', 'innocuous', 'fun', 'are', 'songs', 'girls', 'enjoy', 'plot', 'not', 'complex', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'girls', 'really', 'understand', 'plot', 'anyway', 'enjoy', 'colour', 'songs', 'simple', 'animation', 'simple', 'set', 'up', 'scenes.As', 'adult', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'just', 'too', 'innocuous', 'little', 'here', 'really', 'enjoy', 'however', 'kids', 'were', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'solid', '5', '3', 'find', 'too', 'unstructured', 'badly', 'written', 'badly', 'voiced', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'years']",N/A

949549,A1QVYESH99CE6D,B000BTGY1Y,"T. Taylor ""Crimson Fox""","[14, 14]","I have been a My Little Pony fan since they first came out in the 80's. And I have been collecting the newest generation of ponies and MLP-themed merchandise to add to my old collection.I have all the cartoons and movies so far from G3, and the first few were quite corny IMHO, but they got progressively better.The Princess Promenade has a good story line that kept even me (a 26-year-old woman lol) interested to see what happens next. The animation quality was well-done (except for expected little mistakes here and there) the songs were not annoying like most other cartoon singing, and the characters were very likeable.The only thing still lacking in the G3 movies is some kind of enemy. My favorite episodes from the 80's were the pilot and special which had very well-done bad guys while still not being 'violent'. I think adding a few darker characters would add alot of contrast and interest to the storylines.One thing that disappointed me in Princess Promenade was 'Spike the Dragon'. I remember Spike in the 80's as a cute, scruffy-voiced baby dragon with such a great character to him. I do not like the way he was drawn in this film, or his 'proper' personality. I miss the good ol' 80s Spike. So that was why I gave it 4 instead of 5- Spike was a favorite character of mine in the old cartoons, and it was upsetting to see how they changed him. But it was still a great film, and those who are new to MLP wont notice or care about the change.The previous G3 film 'A Very Minty Christmas' is also very cute, so check that out as well.I look forward to the next film when we finally have unicorns- especially since that probably means there'll be unicorn MLP toys released as well!",4,Definitely the best G3 film so far :-),1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,1696,"['have', 'been', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'fan', 'first', 'came', 'out', '80', 'have', 'been', 'collecting', 'newest', 'generation', 'ponies', 'MLP-themed', 'merchandise', 'add', 'old', 'collection.I', 'have', 'cartoons', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'G3', 'first', 'few', 'were', 'quite', 'corny', 'IMHO', 'got', 'progressively', 'better.The', 'Princess', 'Promenade', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'kept', 'even', '26-year-old', 'woman', 'lol', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'animation', 'quality', 'was', 'well-done', 'expected', 'little', 'mistakes', 'here', 'there', 'songs', 'were', 'not', 'annoying', 'most', 'other', 'cartoon', 'singing', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'likeable.The', 'only', 'thing', 'still', 'lacking', 'G3', 'movies', 'kind', 'enemy', 'favorite', 'episodes', '80', 'were', 'pilot', 'special', 'had', 'very', 'well-done', 'bad', 'guys', 'still', 'not', 'being', ""'violent"", 'think', 'adding', 'few', 'darker', 'characters', 'would', 'add', 'alot', 'contrast', 'interest', 'storylines.One', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'Princess', 'Promenade', 'was', 'Dragon', 'remember', 'Spike', '80', 'cute', 'scruffy-voiced', 'baby', 'dragon', 'such', 'great', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'way', 'was', 'drawn', 'film', ""'proper"", 'personality', 'miss', 'good', 'ol', '80s', 'Spike', 'was', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'instead', '5-', 'Spike', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'mine', 'old', 'cartoons', 'was', 'upsetting', 'see', 'how', 'changed', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'MLP', 'wont', 'notice', 'care', 'change.The', 'previous', 'G3', 'film', 'Very', 'Minty', 'Christmas', 'also', 'very', 'cute', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'well.I', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'have', 'unicorns-', 'especially', 'probably', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unicorn', 'MLP', 'toys', 'released', 'as', 'well']",N/A
949550,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000BTGY1Y,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I grew up watching the older generation MLP, and loved the varied story lines in each episode, with its collection of villains. Unfortunately, my 6.5-year-old does not care for the older MLP shows:( She finds the villains too gross and the ponies do not appeal to her. I think she is attracted to the newer generation ponies because of their cute manga-like features (as seen on the Hub channel).She did like this DVD though because of its charming storyline. Ponyville is hosting the spring parade and Wysteria is all excited. Then things get even more exciting when Wysteria awakens Spike (who does not look anything like the Spike on the new series, just a little griping from my daughter), a cute little dragon. According to legend, when a dragon is brought out of slumber, a new princess will be crowned, so the question is, who will be the Princess of Ponyville?The DVD has several extra features:Pinkie Pie's Lady Bug Jamboree (animated short)Bonus Episode : A Charming BirthdaySing-A-Longs - ""Breezie Blossom"" and ""A Princess is in Town""Five original songsThe show is in full screen format, dolby digital, with English 5.1 surround, and is in color, with a running time of 70 mins.",5,My daughter loves MLP!,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,1189,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'older', 'generation', 'MLP', 'loved', 'varied', 'story', 'lines', 'episode', 'collection', 'villains', 'Unfortunately', '6.5-year-old', 'not', 'care', 'older', 'MLP', 'shows', 'villains', 'too', 'gross', 'ponies', 'do', 'not', 'appeal', 'think', 'attracted', 'newer', 'generation', 'ponies', 'cute', 'manga-like', 'features', 'seen', 'Hub', 'channel', '.She', 'did', 'DVD', 'charming', 'storyline', 'Ponyville', 'hosting', 'spring', 'parade', 'Wysteria', 'excited', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'exciting', 'when', 'Wysteria', 'Spike', 'who', 'not', 'look', 'anything', 'Spike', 'new', 'series', 'just', 'little', 'griping', 'daughter', 'cute', 'little', 'dragon', 'According', 'legend', 'when', 'dragon', 'brought', 'slumber', 'new', 'princess', 'will', 'be', 'crowned', 'question', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'Princess', 'Ponyville', 'DVD', 'several', 'extra', 'features', 'Pinkie', 'Pie', 'Lady', 'Bug', 'Jamboree', 'animated', 'short', 'Bonus', 'Episode', 'Charming', 'BirthdaySing-A-Longs', 'Breezie', 'Blossom', 'A', 'Princess', 'Town', 'Five', 'original', 'songsThe', 'show', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'dolby', 'digital', 'English', '5.1', 'surround', 'color', 'running', 'time', '70', 'mins']",N/A
