I am a lover of all things Italian., and will be the first to cry foul when ""Wop "" jokes are used. However I did take issue with the 'over the top"" dialogue and stereotyped performances given by the parents and some family members. Yeah yeah, I know.. It's supposed to be a comedy, but the laughter is few and far in-between. The relationship between the two gay male leads is interesting, in the fact that the cop character  suddenly chooses ""not"" to be gay anymore. This behavior is exacerbated by the constant derogatory remarks made by his police partner & disapproving mother who manipulates her son into believing what he really wants and who he really is, is heterosexual. He then proceeds to systematically alienate his lover by hiding behind a hetro-induced mentality. What prompts this erratic behavior is caused in part when his partner feels strongly about coming out of the closet. It's as if there are subversive undertones of Gay on Gay bashing. The mood of the film depicts a lot of shouting and self loathing, almost to the point of self destruction. Alas.. in true Hollywood fashion there is a plot twist that plays out as somewhat happily ever after.

Both portrayed the typical cultural stereotypes, and both came off cute but not lasting.  Mambo Italiano deals with a typical Italian family living in Little Italy in Canada.  When their son moves out, moves in with his lover, and then comes out to his family, all hell breaks loose.  The movie tries to be a laugh a minute comedy, but the true comedy comes from Luke Kirby who does an outstanding job.  He is the only character with real comedy and emotion, and he lights up the screen in all his scenes.  It is easy to see why he was cast in the lead.

And so do you.

498973,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00000F5B5,Andy Orrock,"[4, 5]","Let's take 'Mambo Italiano' for what it's worth: a very enjoyable film stocked with a lot of laughs, but also poignant because there's no doubt that the tale has been pulled from the real life experiences of playright Steve Galluccio.While leads Luke Kirby ('Angelo') and Peter Miller ('Nino') don't stand out in any way, it's Paul Sorvino and Ginette Reno as Angelo's parents who will stick with you.  Yes, as others have noted, these are highly stereotypical portrayals.  But it's Gaulluccio's life and *he* wrote the characters that way.  Obviously, he's played it up a bit, but that gives Reno (and especially) Sorvino big meaty roles that they can really sink their teeth into.  Watching Paul Sorvino is a treat.  He's the kind of guy who could read the phone book to you with panache.I also completely loved Mark Camacho's over-the-top, hilariously profane take as TV exec Johnny Christofaro.  In a series of episodes that could again only have been drawn from playright Galluccio's real life experiences, the Christofaro character - in what can best to described as a series of 'friendly' profane explosions - rips into the writer, belittling his work, tearing down his confidence, but then finishing his tirade every time with an upbeat, sincere &quot;How's your Mom?&quot;  Once Angelo hits the big time, there's Christofaro on an interview show in a classic exchange, remembering how he always encouraged Angelo to 'never give up' (replete with a series of now characteristic F bombs).  Nothing could be further from the truth of course, which is what makes it so funny.  Great writing.A hidden gem:  look for Galluccio appearing as 'himself' (in a way) - he's the 'TV version' of Angelo in the sitcom-within-the-movie.",4,Academy Award? No.  Enjoyable picture?

498974,AR15V2ULA2EYM,B00000F5B5,Antonio Giusto,"[0, 1]",I've seen some really crappy films and this one takes the cake. I saw this waste of time when it was on the big screen. The whole time I wanted to get up and walk out. Unfortunetly I was with someone who didn't wanna leave and I couldn't go no matter how much I pleaded. I remember during one scene a character was naming famous Italians and he said &quot;Fellini.&quot; I immedietly yelled out &quot;blasmphemy!&quot; They had no right to mention Fellini's name in such a horrible film. If they had said DeSica I would have started a fire in the theatre.  I've never hated a movie as much as I hate this one. I rembember months later I was walking downtown and I saw a huge 100 foot ad for the film on a building wall. I stopped to spit on it and a couple had smiled and clapped when they saw what I had done. I've never been praised for spitting on something before. It was odd.First off this is the most innacurate display of Italian culture I've ever seen in my life. It's so innacurate it becomes offensive to Italians. I think Paul Sorvino is the only actual Italian in the film. By the way he sucks. That guy cannot act. He was in Goodfellas. Big deal! Any middle aged Italian man would have fit that role perfeclty anyway. I got off topic. For those of you thinking that my opinion is bias cause I'm Italian the same thing go's for My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I felt the same way when I first saw that film.In my opinion comedy is art and surrounding a lame plot with a bunch of cliched stereotypes for cheap laughs is not comedy. The comedic mind has evolved over the years. This movie does not keep up with the evolution of the comedic mind. This movie appeals to the comedic mind of an ape.As the saying around Amazon goes &quot;I give this film 1 star cause I'm not able to give it anyting lower.&quot;,1,The worst film of all time.,1087257600,"06 15, 2004",2004,1812,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'crappy', 'films', 'one', 'cake', 'saw', 'waste', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'big', 'screen', 'whole', 'time', 'wanted', 'get', 'up', 'walk', 'out', 'Unfortunetly', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'leave', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'pleaded', 'remember', 'one', 'scene', 'character', 'was', 'naming', 'famous', 'Italians', 'said', 'quot', 'Fellini.', 'quot', 'immedietly', 'yelled', 'out', 'quot', 'blasmphemy', 'quot', 'had', 'right', 'mention', 'Fellini', 'name', 'such', 'horrible', 'film', 'had', 'said', 'DeSica', 'would', 'have', 'started', 'fire', 'theatre', ""'ve"", 'never', 'hated', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'one', 'rembember', 'months', 'later', 'was', 'walking', 'downtown', 'saw', 'huge', '100', 'foot', 'ad', 'film', 'building', 'wall', 'stopped', 'spit', 'couple', 'had', 'smiled', 'clapped', 'when', 'saw', 'what', 'had', 'done', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'praised', 'spitting', 'something', 'was', 'odd.First', 'most', 'innacurate', 'display', 'Italian', 'culture', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'so', 'innacurate', 'offensive', 'Italians', 'think', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'only', 'actual', 'Italian', 'film', 'way', 'guy', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'was', 'Goodfellas', 'Big', 'deal', 'middle', 'aged', 'Italian', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'role', 'perfeclty', 'anyway', 'got', 'off', 'topic', 'thinking', 'opinion', 'bias', 'cause', ""'m"", 'Italian', 'same', 'thing', 'go', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film.In', 'opinion', 'comedy', 'art', 'surrounding', 'lame', 'plot', 'bunch', 'cliched', 'stereotypes', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'not', 'comedy', 'comedic', 'mind', 'evolved', 'years', 'movie', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'evolution', 'comedic', 'mind', 'movie', 'appeals', 'comedic', 'mind', 'ape.As', 'saying', 'Amazon', 'quot', 'give', 'film', '1', 'star', 'cause', ""'m"", 'not', 'able', 'give', 'anyting', 'lower.', 'quot']",Mambo Italiano

I saw this movie listed as a good gay movie to see, and wasn't sure what to expect, except that it was probably a comedy. I gave this movie 3 stars because the ending is not what I thought it would be, and perhaps maybe my rating is unfair.First, the movie is funny and does portray the stereotypes of the old Italian community. In some ways, the ending of the movie was good with Angelo's family loving him and supporting him for who he is, regardless of him being gay. And Angelo winds up having a different boyfriend. But I thought perhaps Angelo and Nino would reunite in the end, which is not the case. I've read a few other reviews, and I didn't see anyone else pick up on this point. That is that history repeats itself with how Nino treats Angelo. When they were little kids, they were the best of friends. But in high school, Angelo was seen as more of a outcast by others. So, Nino didn't want to be seen associating with Angelo so that he would be liked by the other kids, and he renounced his friendship with Angelo by simply ignoring Angelo. Later on in adult life, Angelo and Nino reconnect and become more than friends and wind up being lovers who live together, but are closeted. Eventually, it comes out that they are gay lovers, and both Angelo's and Nino's parents are upset about this, and try to match them up with some girls. This is where history repeats itself, when Nino renounces his love/relationship with Angelo. And again, the reasons he does this is similar to what he did in high school; he did it to fit in and please others, his mother and peers. Nino dates this woman and eventually marries her and has a kid on the way. My heart went out to Angelo - both when Nino renounces his love for Angelo, and when you see Nino getting married. But I suppose in some ways, this is somewhat true to real life. The difference though in real life is that you typically see that there are guys who are gay, but don't realize or don't want to admit it. And when they are young, they get married to a woman and have kids, because that's what the social norms are.

Yes, the ethno-humor is a bit over the top but still manages to get a few laughs and remain cute. Cute and funny are the keywords here, as there's very little seriousness in the manner in which this movie depicts the ""coming out"" theme. It might be funny to see how the movie would work if it was set in South Philly or Mulberry St in NY's Little Italy. It's set in a small suburban Italian neighborhood of Montreal.Much to his parent's dismay, the main character, Angelo (played by Luke Kirby), isn't interested in finding a 9-5 job with good security or a nice Italian girl to marry.  He also doesn't want to hang out in gay bars, march in the gay parade or even answer the phones for the gay hotline, but he does want to love someone and he wants his parents to know and accept who he really is.  He envisions a life very different than the one his parent's had and one which strays from the traditions in which he was raised.  He lives with his boyfriend and wants to write movies so you can just imagine the drama that ensues with ""La Famiglia"".Paul Sorvino doesn't stray too far from his typecast as the Italian father, but his acting remains refreshing.  With the help of Ginette Reno (who plays the Italian mom), the parents create some humorous melodrama in the process of ""adapting"" to their son's coming out. A noteworthy performance is also given by Claudia Ferri who plays Angelo's neurotic but understanding sister.Expect this movie to tackle the subject light-heartedly.

And while it plays a little too heavily on the Italian-american stereotype, it is a charming film about a young man coming to terms with who he is and his neurotic family's response.Angelo is a nice young man who was always picked on in school, even by his one-time closest friend, Nino.  As adults, Nino and Angelo are reunited and become lovers.  Everything is perfect for the young couple until Angelo decides he wants to come out to his family.  Once Nino's mother finds out, things begin to unhinge.  It is easy to root for the once ostracized Angelo, who always took the abuse of others while keeping his sexual orientation private.  Anyone who has felt outcast or different in their lives will be able to understand his situation and determination to live his life honestly and openly.This is not a perfect film but it does have its touching moments and enough laughs to keep you interested.

Everything is right to the point.  That's also a compliment to director, &Eacute;mile Gaudreault.  The pace is so excellently directed that you lose all sense of time.  I just loved the plot.  It wasn't terribly predictable.  Like, I loved how our two lovers don't get together in the end.  THAT would have made it trite.A point that I'm really glad the movie discussed is the ""man who is attracted to and wants to be with other men, but not interested in being honest about his life with anyone but his lover.""  That's what Nino is.  Angelo is much more interested in not living a lie, and that's who we come to respect in the movie.  It's clear that Nino is not interested in self-dignity, and that's who we feel sorry for.I also really loved how we see a realistic and detailed view of the process Angelo's parents go through in learning to accept there son.  Gay children should show this movie to their parents if they're having trouble accepting their gay children.The acting is also fabulous.  You have to be a very skilled actor to purposefully play a stereotype and at the same time, believe in your character so much that you make this character a real, truthful person that your audience can actually relate to.

His life is entralled with two controlling parents whose only desire is for their son to meet ""a nice Italian girl"" and settle down, one sister who lives for her Valium and visits to every psychologist in Toronto, and his soon-to-be extremely closeted cop boyfriend Nino.One mistake the movie could have made, but never does, is to take itself too serioiusly. It's a fun romp, fast paced, and full of funny moments. As Angelo comes out to his parents, you seem him blossoming within his own life, as he attempts to take charge of the situation. Luke Kirby does an excellent job in his role as Angelo, allowing the audiences to sympathize and laugh with him at the same time.

Since I was bored, I found myself looking at other people there to see if I could get a read on what they were thinking, and after it was over I asked my friend what he thought. He said, ""Oh, it was okay"" but didn't elaborate. So let me: it was painfully unfunny, with jokes or punchlines that fell flat, horrible acting, totally predictable, and very forgetable. This is a movie you might want to rent ONLY if you're really bored and nearly every other movie is out. And even then, you'd be better off to go home empty handed.

He enjoyed singing and dancing with his eccentric aunt more than sports, and was obsessed with TV shows like Dynasty, copying down every word of dialogue. He's best friends with Nino, a popular jock at school, but when the other kids start to pick on Angelo and call him a fag, Nino stops hanging out with him in public.Flash forward fifteen years. Not much has changed. Angelo is trapped in a dead-end job while he secretly longs to be a television writer. He still lives at home with his overprotective, traditional Italian family, where you're expected to stay home until you get married. The only problem is, Angelo is a closeted gay man and he doesn't want to get married. He shocks his parents by moving out into an apartment of his own. That's when fate steps in. His apartment is vandalized and who should be the responding officer but Angelo's childhood friend Nino? They renew their friendship and it turns out that Nino is closeted as well. The two men embark on a secret romance, but soon Angelo finds himself longing to come out. Nino adamantly refuses to come out for fear of his job and interfering mother.When Angelo finally comes out to his family all hell breaks loose. His strict Catholic parents can't accept it and stop speaking to him, his sister is driven into counseling to deal with their dysfunctional family, and Nino can't handle the pressure. Can Angelo and Nino make their relationship work? Will Angelo's parents ever accept him? Can they all find happiness?This movie is a little like a gay Italian version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. It plays on broad cultural stereotypes for laughs, but it does have a heart. The beginning of the movie feels a little sitcom-like, but it definitely improves as it goes on. The story tackles the difficult and serious issues of coming out to your family and dealing with a lover who prefers to stay closeted with a surprising sensitivity and realism. Mambo Italiano certainly has its flaws, but I thought it more than overcame them by the end.

With a woman...Directed by Emile Gaudreault, who co-wrote the script with Steve Galluccio based on the latter's stageplay, MAMBO ITALIANO has all the verve and panache of a 1930's screwball comedy, complete with quickfire dialogue and finely-judged comic performances. Not being Italian, this reviewer isn't in a position to judge whether the OTT characters are stereotypes or just witty send-ups, a comic exaggeration of reality, but industry vet Sorvino and legendary French-language chanteuse Reno steal the show as Kirby's constantly bickering parents, prone to making wild dramas out of the smallest problems, which has the unfortunate side-effect of making Kirby himself seem a little too laidback in comparison.The narrative seems aimless at times, veering between comedy and drama and all points in between, but there are plenty of distractions along the way, including Claudia Ferri as Kirby's therapy-addicted sister, Mary Walsh as Miller's scheming mama, and Miller himself, a gorgeous grade-A hunk of the highest order, around whom much of the plot revolves. It's pretty superficial overall, and mainstream gay cinema needs another romantic comedy like HALLOWEEN needs another sequel, but MAMBO ITALIANO does much to ingratiate itself with the broadest possible audience, though the unconventional 'happy' ending may undermine the experience for some viewers. Cinematographer Serge Ladouceur employs a vivid color scheme which lights up the screen throughout, but the compositions are fairly unadventurous, and the movie plays better on TV than it probably did in theaters.",3,Quickfire comedy-drama aims for broad audience,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,1929,"['MAMBO', 'ITALIANO', 'Canada', '2003', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'DigitalTired', 'living', 'denial', 'aspiring', 'gay', 'writer', 'Luke', 'Kirby', 'out', 'hyper-emotional', 'Italian', 'parents', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'Ginette', 'Reno', 'causing', 'rift', 'deeply', 'closeted', 'boyfriend', 'Peter', 'Miller', 'who', 'compelled', 'reassert', 'masculinity', 'woman', 'Directed', 'Emile', 'Gaudreault', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Steve', 'Galluccio', 'based', 'latter', 'stageplay', 'MAMBO', 'ITALIANO', 'verve', 'panache', '1930', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'complete', 'quickfire', 'dialogue', 'finely-judged', 'comic', 'performances', 'Not', 'being', 'Italian', 'reviewer', ""n't"", 'position', 'judge', 'OTT', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'witty', 'send-ups', 'comic', 'exaggeration', 'reality', 'industry', 'vet', 'Sorvino', 'legendary', 'French-language', 'chanteuse', 'Reno', 'steal', 'show', 'Kirby', 'constantly', 'bickering', 'parents', 'prone', 'making', 'wild', 'dramas', 'smallest', 'problems', 'unfortunate', 'side-effect', 'making', 'Kirby', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'laidback', 'comparison.The', 'narrative', 'aimless', 'times', 'veering', 'comedy', 'drama', 'points', 'are', 'plenty', 'distractions', 'way', 'including', 'Claudia', 'Ferri', 'Kirby', 'therapy-addicted', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Walsh', 'Miller', 'scheming', 'mama', 'Miller', 'gorgeous', 'grade-A', 'hunk', 'highest', 'order', 'whom', 'much', 'plot', 'pretty', 'superficial', 'overall', 'mainstream', 'gay', 'cinema', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'HALLOWEEN', 'sequel', 'MAMBO', 'ITALIANO', 'much', 'ingratiate', 'broadest', 'possible', 'audience', 'unconventional', ""'happy"", 'ending', 'may', 'undermine', 'experience', 'viewers', 'Cinematographer', 'Serge', 'Ladouceur', 'vivid', 'color', 'scheme', 'up', 'screen', 'compositions', 'are', 'fairly', 'unadventurous', 'movie', 'better', 'TV', 'probably', 'did', 'theaters']",Mambo Italiano

I'm gay and Italian and I was quite worried that an attempt to portray a combo of both in merely 85 minutes would result in a glut of over-done cliches and caricature-like stereotypes.  I also think that movies that focus upon the traditions and idiosyncracies of various sub-cultures often pigeonhole their respective population into a long list of unfair expectations and prejudices.Fortunately, Mambo Italiano pulled off the impossible.  It poked fun of tradition while allowing the viewer to realize that tradition and culture can be tortuously binding and limiting.  Where this little film also succeeded was in its juxtaposition of the old and the new.  The young progenitors of culture are usually the ones who break new ground, who shed the excess and limiting traditions for new, more progressive ones.  But, at the same time, as traditions become entrenched in our adolescent minds, they often become so set in adulthood that they have fossilized into our subconscious.  We do things without realizing that we are doing them.  Mambo Italiano presents this fight.  Some of the characters move on.  They live in harmony with their own culture but not limited by it.  Others succumb to the claws of their predecessors, out of weakness, fear and even comfort.  These results are inevitable in any true subculture.  We persist.  We succumb.  We endure.I recommend this film to anyone, especially those of ethnic backgrounds.  It's never heavy-handed.  It's sometimes too outrageous.  You'll smile.  You laugh.  You'll be frustrated.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[6, 6]","The 2003 comedy ""Mambo Italiano"" is a coming-out film about two young Italian men named Angelo Barberini (Luke Kirby) and Nino Paventi (Peter Miller) who both grew up and live in Canada.  Directed by &Eacute;mile Gaudreault and written originally as a play by Steve Galluccio & &Eacute;mile Gaudreault, the film begins with Angelo's description of his childhood (the young Angelo played by Michael Romano) in which he and Nino (the young Nino played by Mathieu Major-Langevin) were best friends, but as they grew older, Nino spent increasingly less time with Angelo until he didn't want to be with Angelo at all.  It wasn't until both were adults that their paths crossed again: Angelo wanting to be a writer, but working as a phone-in travel agent, and Nino as a policeman.  To Angelo's surprise, Nino initiates a more intimate relationship than Angelo would have ever expected.  After the two move in together, Angelo wants to come out to his parents, Gino Barberini (Paul Sorvino) & Maria Barberini (Ginette Reno), and announce his relationship with Nino.  However, Nino, who fears being ostracized by his mother, Lina Paventi (Mary Walsh), and his fellow police officers, wants to keep their relationship a secret, as does Angelo's obsessive sister Anna Barberini (Claudia Ferri) who inadvertently discovers their relationship. Undeterred, after Angelo comes out to his parents, Nino moves back home with his mother and starts to date the obnoxious woman Pina Lunetti (Sophie Lorain) to the delight of his mother Lina, but to Angelo's dismay.  Will Gino & Maria be able to accept their gay son?  Will Angelo and Nino get back together, or will they move on with their lives?  Will Angelo aspire to being something greater than a phone-in travel agent?  You'll just have to watch this sometimes whimsical and always entertaining film to find out!With an entertaining story & dialog, interesting characters and a good dose of humor, ""Mambo Italiano"" is a fun and engaging film to watch.  The most memorable acting came from Paul Sorvino, Ginette Reno, Mary Walsh and Claudia Ferri.  Other memorable characters include Angelo's Aunt Yolanda (Tara Nicodemo), Rosetta (Pierrette Robitaille), Giorgio (Dino Tavarone), Alicia (Ellen David), Raymond (Shaun Balbar), Steve (Matt Holland) and the woman seeking help (Lisa Bronwyn Moore).

Because this is a comedy, his bashing in high school is treated lightly, but you get the real sense that his life hasn't been easy.Into his life falls Nino, his sometimes-friend in school and now a very hot cop.  They fall for each other and move in together. Angelo is deliriously happy, but Nino still clings to his comfortable closet. Their families make things worse.I empathized with both Angelo and Nino and felt the characters were well developed.  Although I ultimately was disappointed in Nino (and surprised at his hard-heartedness) I can understand his choices.Paul Sorvino is one of my favorite actors, and plays the father with great sincerity as well as humor.  Angelo's sister is captivating, if a little frustrating, and Nino's mother is wonderful too.Great story, great characters, good pace.

While it is obvious that the makers of the film are riding on the coattails of the successful MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING the gay plot and different ending put an interesting spin of what many will consider a formula movie.  Well formula or not my partner and I really enjoyed it.I think the reason this movie succeeds so well is because it isn't afraid to poke fun at itself.  For example, the over the top acting is superb, a good thing too because anything less would be ridiculous.Not to be too frivilous there are a few serious moments, which add a nice depth to the story.  I particularly liked the scene where the Angelo character (Luke Kirby) asks his ex-lover Nino (Peter Miller) if he had ever loved him.  The reaction on Angelo's face to Nino's lame answer is skilled acting at its best.Production wise there is no skimping like we sometimes see with other films of this genre.  The movie is crisp, clear and beautiful.  The public garden scenes are especially lush (practically makes you want to move to Canada).

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[6, 13]","To be completely honest I didn't know what to expect when I first popped MAMBO ITALIANO into my DVD player, but I did expect a film with much more substance and sincerity than what was delivered. The premise of MAMBO ITALIANO is nothing new: a young man, Angelo, comes out of the closet to his family when they realize that his ""roommate"" is so much more than just someone who helps contribute to the cable bill. However, to add a spin Angelo comes from a quintessential Italian family who is less than sympathetic or understanding to his lifestyle. His mother and father are the stereotypical high-strung, overly emotional Italian parents who want their son to meet their expectations and be a good reflection on their Italian neighbors and friends. But unfortunately this came off as flat and tiring. Been there, done that. Furthermore, it is apparent that whomever wrote this screenplay has no inkling, let alone personal experiences, of coming out of the closet or being gay. I found many scenes and dialogue to be outright ridiculous and contrived. The inclusion of the gay village that Angelo visits for the first time and his insistence that he has nothing in common with ""them"" is hilarious, but not in the manner which it was intended. One would think that he would have had some exposure to gay culture, whether directly or unintentional, to be more educated and acclimated. To add insult to injury the entire sequence where Angelo volunteered at the gay teen hotline is ridiculous. Angelo and Nino's relationship is as cold as my freezer, and just not believable in any context. In addition, the laughs were few and far between.

Although the plot plays like a comedy, the theme is serious in that we see how a religous and old-fashoned family comes to terms with their offspring's sexuality, a sexuality that is still hard for some families to come to terms with. I would suggest this film to anyone who is thinking about coming out of the closet, and I also suggest it to all families who are having a difficult time in accepting their child's homosexuality. What makes a person's gay life so hard for some parents is the fact that these parents have different opinions about a child's chosen path in life. What these parents need to do is to accept that homosexuality is not something one chooses and that in order for someone to be happy they must live their life honestly and openly even if it is against a father or mother's wishes. Mary Walsh, a popular comedian in Canada, steals the film as the mother of a gay cop. Her performance is campy, funny, and hilarious. The DVD is now, unfortunately, out-of-print, but there are a few copies available from private sellers. This is truely a forgotten film that we all should view. The movie has a special place in my DVD collection and I know you will enjoy it.",5,"""Cute""",1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,1521,"['better-than-average', 'gay-themed', 'film', 'Mambo', 'Italiano', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'last', '10', 'years', 'explore', 'gay', 'issues', 'comedic', 'lighthearted', 'way', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'story', 'Catholic/Italian', 'family', 'living', 'beautiful', 'Montreal', 'dealing', 'son', 'recent', 'outing', 'homosexual', 'plot', 'comedy', 'theme', 'serious', 'see', 'how', 'religous', 'old-fashoned', 'family', 'terms', 'offspring', 'sexuality', 'sexuality', 'still', 'hard', 'families', 'come', 'terms', 'would', 'suggest', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'thinking', 'coming', 'closet', 'also', 'suggest', 'families', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'accepting', 'child', 'homosexuality', 'What', 'person', 'gay', 'life', 'so', 'hard', 'parents', 'fact', 'parents', 'have', 'different', 'opinions', 'child', 'chosen', 'path', 'life', 'What', 'parents', 'need', 'do', 'accept', 'homosexuality', 'not', 'something', 'one', 'order', 'someone', 'be', 'happy', 'must', 'live', 'life', 'honestly', 'openly', 'even', 'father', 'mother', 'wishes', 'Mary', 'Walsh', 'popular', 'comedian', 'Canada', 'film', 'mother', 'gay', 'cop', 'performance', 'campy', 'funny', 'hilarious', 'DVD', 'now', 'unfortunately', 'out-of-print', 'are', 'few', 'copies', 'available', 'private', 'sellers', 'truely', 'forgotten', 'film', 'should', 'view', 'movie', 'special', 'place', 'DVD', 'collection', 'know', 'will', 'enjoy']",Mambo Italiano

I do admit that I was disappointed with the ending at first.  We want Angelo to win Nino back but in the end it became apparent that Nino was too scared to come out of the closet and disappoint his mother.  Unfortunately, it's a scenario that has become too common when closeted gay men get married and get an innocent third party involved.  I personally would have rewritten the ending so that we see Nino's regret but it's too late to stop the marriage.  It was nice to see that look of uncertainty on his face; he'll always wonder if he's doing the right thing.

There are some really hysterical lines in this movie, but in general I found the whole thing to have been done. Putting an Italian twist on it, was in theory a good idea, but the whole film just comes across as clich&eacute;. The gay stereotypes are outdated and the other F word is thrown around way too much.
