To be honest, I was expecting The Asylum's usual fare(thin plot, decent CGI, fair amount of action). Yet, I was really surprised to see that Battledogs stepped up things a notch. Course, lately--I've been seeing that The Asylum have been putting alot more effort in the films they've been making for the SyFy Channel. While I don't know what's spurred them to do that, I am thankful that they're going in a more positive direction with their films. I can't wait to see their future endeavors. I've told everyone that, at some point, people are going to start looking at The Asylum as a more legitimate filmmaking company than the mockbuster maker that everyone complains that they are. If people were to look at their catalogue of films, they have a great deal of originals that are great films. Battle Dogs is a film that takes hold of its' plot and uses its' limited budget to create something original and fun for everyone to watch. I was so impressed with Battledogs that I hope The Asylum & SyFy Channel continue the story with Battledogs 2.The only gripe that I had with Battledogs seems to be the same gripe that reviewers on the internet have been harping about...the design of the Battledogs themselves. How, you say? Well- even though the overall design of the creatures are fine for this type of film- other than different colors for the fur, they use basically the same CGI model for every one that you see on camera. I don't really mind it too much as low-budget films tend to do that.Battledogs is one of The Asylum's upper tier of films and it shows. I highly recommend you give Battledogs a good looksee. It's a great film for lovers of the genre and then some.",5,Battledogs.....,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,1961,"['Manhattan', 'quarantined', 'when', 'Lupine', 'virus', 'spreads', 'wildfire', 'turning', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'violent', 'wolves..but', 'least', 'worries', 'rogue', 'General', 'virus', 'create', 'army', 'other', 'means.I', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'watching', 'Battledogs', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'expecting', 'Asylum', 'usual', 'fare', 'thin', 'plot', 'decent', 'CGI', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'see', 'Battledogs', 'stepped', 'up', 'things', 'notch', 'Course', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'Asylum', 'have', 'been', 'putting', 'alot', 'more', 'effort', 'films', ""'ve"", 'been', 'making', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'spurred', 'do', 'am', 'thankful', ""'re"", 'going', 'more', 'positive', 'direction', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'future', 'endeavors', ""'ve"", 'told', 'everyone', 'point', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'start', 'looking', 'Asylum', 'more', 'legitimate', 'filmmaking', 'company', 'mockbuster', 'maker', 'everyone', 'are', 'people', 'were', 'look', 'catalogue', 'films', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'originals', 'are', 'great', 'films', 'Battle', 'Dogs', 'film', 'hold', 'plot', 'limited', 'budget', 'create', 'something', 'original', 'fun', 'everyone', 'watch', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'Battledogs', 'hope', 'Asylum', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'continue', 'story', 'Battledogs', '2.The', 'only', 'gripe', 'had', 'Battledogs', 'be', 'same', 'gripe', 'internet', 'have', 'been', 'harping', 'design', 'Battledogs', 'How', 'say', 'Well-', 'even', 'overall', 'design', 'creatures', 'are', 'fine', 'type', 'film-', 'other', 'different', 'colors', 'fur', 'use', 'basically', 'same', 'CGI', 'model', 'one', 'see', 'camera', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'too', 'much', 'low-budget', 'films', 'tend', 'do', 'that.Battledogs', 'one', 'Asylum', 'upper', 'tier', 'films', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', 'Battledogs', 'good', 'looksee', 'great', 'film', 'lovers', 'genre', 'then']",Battledogs

The blood is horrible, the weapons are a mix of really bad modified nerf guns, the american gas masks are actually russian surplus.  The main actor could try to act his way out of a bag and would die, the main actress looked like a deer in headlights the whole movie and the other main actress reminded me of Raymond Burr in Godzilla where he would show up every so often and say something important.  However, even with all those negatives I loved the movie.  I sat enthralled for the complete 90 minutes watching this thing.  It was as if the hypnotoad from Futurerama was there forcing me to watch it.  It was the most amazing trainwreck of a movie I have ever seen and would actually sit and watch it again just to see what else I could find with the movie that could make me laugh.  I will say one thing though.  I do not understand what was used at the end of the movie and that is what was disturbing to me.All that being said, you need to watch this movie and prepare for the eventual takeover of the werewolves.  Learn from the governments mistakes and create your own bugout bag for when these creatures eventually make it to your town.

Of course there is the occasional one that even I can't find a silver lining in. luckily this is one of the better Asylum movies and it is a werewolf flick on top of that, who doesn't like a werewolf flick. This was a film they made with the SyFy channel like they do most of the time. It actually is a cool little flick that while not perfect is still fun.A woman named Donna has just arrived in New York and is not feeling very well after her flight. Unfortunately for her she was bitten by a wolf elsewhere and has brought the virus back with her. She turns at starts to attack others at the airport creating pandemic of werewolf proportions. This naturally brings in the authorities who lock the infected and everyone that was there down. Major Brian Hoffman wants to find a cure for these poor people but his superiors have other things in mind.I have to say that I was kinda surprised by how they played this out. They took this flick a little more serious than they normally do. The first half of this movie is straight up more serious than most things they have done lately while the second half turns into a more fun ride.  Shane Van Dyke [a writer on ""Chernobyl Diaries""] came up with a cool little idea here treating werewolves like a virus outbreak. Debuting Director Alexander Yellen did a good enough job here that I will be looking for more films from this person in the future.Craig Sheffer, Dennis Haysbert, Ernie Hudson, Kate Vernon, Ariana Richards and more all do a good job here bringing the characters to life. Speaking of characters something that you normally don't get in these types of flicks is character development. I am glad to say that you get a bit of that here.Now it is an asylum flick so it isn't perfect like the effects and such but over all I liked the look of the werewolves in this. The action is good but like any good Asylum flick things can get crazy. Still I think this is a fun flick that more people would enjoy then one would think.

1635900,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BMUL8QC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[0, 0]","Asylum Films (in conjunction with the SyFy Channel) are notorious for creating monstrously bad creature features. Whether producing cheap imitations of movies currently in theaters (mockbusters) or coming up with the next awesome genetic hybrid, the best Asylum films can be relied on for a chuckle or two. The worst, however, can be absolutely painful. &#34;Battledogs&#34; is somewhat surprising, it plays as a straight werewolf saga as opposed to something distinctly more wacky. This makes it better than most of Asylum's efforts, and also somewhat less fun. It's not really until the second half that &#34;Battledogs&#34; embraces an over-the-top lunacy that really entertains. What this film does offer, however, is a better cast than you might expect. Not only does it have decent actors, they are actually given the opportunity to try to develop more complex characters. Imagine that! What a novelty for a SyFy movie. The cast includes Craig Sheffer, Dennis Haysbert, Kate Vernon, Ernie Hudson, Ariana Richards, Wes Studi, and Bill Duke.The conceit of the movie is that it treats a werewolf uprising as if it's a viral outbreak. I liked how the movie kicked off its plot. Patient Zero (Richards, who happens to be that little girl from Jurassic Park), so to speak, arrives in a New York airport feeling a bit under the weather. Before she can even collect her luggage, she turns into a big beastie and savages the other travelers. This sets off a chain reaction as many of the attack victims convert to werewolf status. The airport is quarantined and it's time for the experts to take over. Vernon plays a scientist from the CDC, Sheffer is a military investigator, and Haysbert plays the requisite military psycho who sees the potential in weaponizing the disease. Of course, man turns into the deadliest foe and the trio of Sheffer, Richards, and Vernon must evade certain annihilation to create a vaccine for the condition. Luckily, Richards has a large chunk of tooth still in her arm to make this possible! The movie escalates as the President (Duke) gives the order to bomb the island before the werewolves can spread. Will the heroes discover a cure? Will the bombs fall? Is there time for a little romance? The ending gets rather loopy, but I quite liked it!This is, obviously, a low budget endeavor so expectations for gore, special effects, and CGI must be put into perspective. The werewolves are not terrible in creation or execution. I did, however, think they lacked motivation. They just seemed to like to murder people, they never stayed to feed. What a waste! The action sequences are better than expected. And as the movie progressed, they just got bigger and bigger. What really distinguishes &#34;Battledogs,&#34; though, are the actors. Vernon (so effective in Battlestar Gallactica) is quite good, and Richards is a surprisingly strong and sympathetic character. Sheffer (A River Runs Through It) is credible as well. Haysbert is, perhaps, a bit too one dimensional for my taste. This is another one of those movies where a military leader has a stable of unquestioning grunts available to commit blatantly unnecessary atrocities. Is &#34;Battledogs&#34; good? Not particularly. But it is certainly better than I anticipated being a frequent admirer of bad movie magic.
