1259073,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B002ASVYOG,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 2]","I've found the ""10 Minute Solution"" brand of DVDs to always be quite amazing, and this DVD was no different.  It is focused on cardio hip-hop dance moves that were very fun to do in addition to being aerobic.  The instructor, Kristin Jacobs, made the segments so much fun with her vibrant personality and likable teaching, adding enjoyment to the workout!  She teaches, not by slowing down the moves, but rather she teaches the feet first before then adding the arms.  It's not a DVD for absolute beginners, but people with some background in exercise or dance should be able to catch on relatively quickly.  Like other ""10 Minute Solution"" dance DVDs this was was broken into 5 10-minute segments, but different from the other dance DVDs these segments were then broken down into 2 5-minute routines, all in all creating 10 little routines.  I didn't find too much variation in the styling of each different 10 minute segment, although I did see that each segment contains a hint of flair from b-boy, jazz funk, and krump style.  Overall, I really enjoy and recommend this DVD to exercisers who love to dance; I don't think it will be a regretted buy!",5,"Really, really fun!",1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1152,"[""'ve"", 'found', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'brand', 'DVDs', 'always', 'be', 'quite', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'was', 'different', 'focused', 'cardio', 'hip-hop', 'dance', 'moves', 'were', 'very', 'fun', 'do', 'addition', 'being', 'aerobic', 'instructor', 'Kristin', 'Jacobs', 'made', 'segments', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'vibrant', 'personality', 'likable', 'teaching', 'adding', 'enjoyment', 'workout', 'not', 'slowing', 'down', 'moves', 'rather', 'feet', 'first', 'then', 'adding', 'arms', 'not', 'DVD', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'people', 'background', 'exercise', 'dance', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'catch', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'other', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'was', 'was', 'broken', '5', '10-minute', 'segments', 'different', 'other', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'segments', 'were', 'then', 'broken', 'down', '2', '5-minute', 'routines', 'creating', '10', 'little', 'routines', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'much', 'variation', 'styling', 'different', '10', 'minute', 'segment', 'did', 'see', 'segment', 'hint', 'flair', 'b-boy', 'jazz', 'funk', 'krump', 'style', 'Overall', 'really', 'enjoy', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'exercisers', 'who', 'love', 'dance', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'regretted', 'buy']",10 Minute Solution: Hip Hop Dance Mix

However, I think this is at least worthy of four stars just for Kristin's energy and personality alone.  (I like the fact that she speaks loudly and clearly with a genuine non-stop smile.)  I'm really enjoying the video and I've only used two of the workouts so far.  I use videos like this one primarily for good warm-ups for my kettlebell routines, not for my heavy cardio days.  That said, the music and moves are fantastic and her cuing is spot on.  She makes me want to go out and dance, which I haven't done in years :-); the fun factor is extremely high.

I own several other 10 Minute Solutions and they are all hit or miss but this one is definitely a miss.I have been dancing since 4 years old: jazz, ballet, tap, ballroom, and yes, hip hop and I just could not enjoy this DVD.I found the choreography confusing and a little disjointed. The moves did not seem to run into each other very well and I found the footwork and arm movements not complimentary at all. Very often I could do one and not the other. I tried the whole disc twice, and just couldn't pull it off. I felt awkward all the way through.There were only 2 sections I halfway enjoyed, but 2 out of 5 isn't really that good.I must say the instructor is likeable but I just didn't enjoy her routines.

1259081,A1I610BOEJMTGP,B002ASVYOG,Rayna,"[10, 10]","I got this DVD for Christmas and I've been really enjoying it. Some dance workout DVDs I've done before have been frustratingly hard to follow (I'm looking at you, Dancing With The Stars Latin Dance Cardio), but this is one has been a lot easier to get. I really like the way she starts with a simple step with just the legs/feet, then adds arms, and then once you practice that a few times, adds on from there. It makes it much easier to catch on to the steps quicker. In addition to being easy to learn, the dances are a lot of fun and I definitely work up a sweat doing them.I also really like the setup of the disc--there are 5 workouts, each ten minutes, and you can mix and match them however you want. Do as many or as few as you want, in whatever order you want. It's a great setup really, because while it can be hard to get motivated to exercise, most anyone can commit to 10 minutes, and I find that once I start it's so fun that I just want to do more.My only complaint is really not so specific to this DVD as to all exercise DVDs, but I can't help being annoyed when the instructor talks to me like she can see me. ""You're doing great!"" ""I had so much fun with you today!"" I don't get why they all do this...I guess at some point, someone found that strategy to be affective with some people, but I just can't get into that kind of thing. It just adds an element of insincerity. But oh well, I think she's a good teacher other than that and it doesn't stop me from wanting to do the DVD so whatever.Anyway, I definitely recommend this DVD for anyone who likes dancing and is looking for a fun, simple way to get exercise.",4,Full of fun and sweat!,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,1635,"['got', 'DVD', 'Christmas', ""'ve"", 'been', 'really', 'enjoying', 'dance', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'done', 'before', 'have', 'been', 'frustratingly', 'hard', 'follow', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'Latin', 'Dance', 'Cardio', 'one', 'been', 'lot', 'easier', 'get', 'really', 'way', 'simple', 'step', 'just', 'legs/feet', 'then', 'arms', 'then', 'once', 'practice', 'few', 'times', 'there', 'much', 'easier', 'catch', 'steps', 'quicker', 'addition', 'being', 'easy', 'learn', 'dances', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'definitely', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'doing', 'them.I', 'also', 'really', 'setup', 'disc', 'are', '5', 'workouts', 'ten', 'minutes', 'can', 'mix', 'match', 'however', 'want', 'Do', 'many', 'as', 'few', 'want', 'order', 'want', 'great', 'setup', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'get', 'motivated', 'exercise', 'most', 'anyone', 'can', 'commit', '10', 'minutes', 'find', 'once', 'start', 'so', 'fun', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'more.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'specific', 'DVD', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'annoyed', 'when', 'instructor', 'talks', 'can', 'see', ""'re"", 'doing', 'great', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'do', 'guess', 'point', 'someone', 'found', 'strategy', 'be', 'affective', 'people', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'kind', 'thing', 'just', 'element', 'insincerity', 'oh', 'well', 'think', 'good', 'teacher', 'other', ""n't"", 'stop', 'wanting', 'do', 'DVD', 'so', 'whatever.Anyway', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'dancing', 'looking', 'fun', 'simple', 'way', 'get', 'exercise']",10 Minute Solution: Hip Hop Dance Mix

She's friendly, encouraging, energetic who speaks clearly w/great cuing & she can actaully dance. She has such enthusiasm & love of dance, it keeps you going, unlike other dvds that you can see the instructor is tired or doesn't like to workout that can make you tired as well.This is 5 ten minute workouts teaching you hip hop w/Kristin breaking it down to simple step touches or slides or kicks & then building up the lower body & then adding the arms. By always keeping you moving, you are never bored & you are always practicing even as you learn more.She chose the more energetic moves of hip hop w/the arm movements, it's only slightly watered down to be easy to follow w/such constraints in time, but Kristin makes it easy to follow, that if you don't get it the first time, you still know what to do & will have it down in no time. There is a few times I had to hit slow-mo, but considering such time limits, she does a beautiful job in pace of keeping you moving without leaving you standing there lost.I wish all dance workout dvds kept to this formula, some disappointingly either keep to such easy & boring moves that need no breakdown, or else just show you once quick in normal tempo, practice a few times & move on to a totally different move leaving you confused. I only have liked those that kept to this formula.I'm not sure I'd go as far to say this is fine for first timers to dance dvds unless they can dance at least decently naturally, but this is great for anyone else.Check Collagevideo for more video clips & reviewsAlso, TotalFitnessDvds does longer video clip segments in the future, I'm sure they will do it for this one in the future.",4,fun/energetic instructor that keeps you moving,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,1701,"['Kristin', 'Jacobs', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'friendly', 'encouraging', 'energetic', 'who', 'clearly', 'w/great', 'cuing', 'can', 'actaully', 'dance', 'such', 'enthusiasm', 'love', 'dance', 'going', 'other', 'dvds', 'can', 'see', 'instructor', 'tired', ""n't"", 'like', 'workout', 'can', 'make', 'tired', 'well.This', '5', 'ten', 'minute', 'workouts', 'teaching', 'hip', 'hop', 'w/Kristin', 'breaking', 'down', 'simple', 'step', 'touches', 'slides', 'kicks', 'then', 'building', 'up', 'lower', 'body', 'then', 'adding', 'arms', 'always', 'keeping', 'moving', 'are', 'never', 'bored', 'are', 'always', 'practicing', 'even', 'learn', 'more.She', 'chose', 'more', 'energetic', 'moves', 'hip', 'hop', 'w/the', 'arm', 'movements', 'only', 'slightly', 'watered', 'down', 'be', 'easy', 'follow', 'w/such', 'constraints', 'time', 'Kristin', 'easy', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'time', 'still', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'will', 'have', 'down', 'time', 'few', 'times', 'had', 'hit', 'slow-mo', 'considering', 'such', 'time', 'limits', 'beautiful', 'job', 'pace', 'keeping', 'moving', 'leaving', 'standing', 'there', 'lost.I', 'wish', 'dance', 'workout', 'dvds', 'kept', 'formula', 'disappointingly', 'keep', 'such', 'easy', 'boring', 'moves', 'need', 'breakdown', 'else', 'just', 'show', 'once', 'quick', 'normal', 'tempo', 'practice', 'few', 'times', 'move', 'totally', 'different', 'move', 'leaving', 'confused', 'only', 'have', 'liked', 'kept', 'formula.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'fine', 'first', 'timers', 'dance', 'dvds', 'can', 'dance', 'least', 'decently', 'naturally', 'great', 'anyone', 'else.Check', 'Collagevideo', 'more', 'video', 'clips', 'reviewsAlso', 'TotalFitnessDvds', 'longer', 'video', 'clip', 'segments', 'future', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'do', 'one', 'future']",10 Minute Solution: Hip Hop Dance Mix
