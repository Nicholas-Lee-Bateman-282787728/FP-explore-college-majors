Now, both Mary and Rhoda are (conveniently) single again, both in New York, and both the mothers of college-aged daughters. They're both having trouble in their respective careers, and with life in general, as women hovering at the next phase of their lives, and need one another's support more than ever.Diehard fans of MTM will have to ignore the flimsy plot and simply concentrate on the actors and characters they loved -- after all, having them together for any reason whatsoever is better than not having them together at all, isn't it? Understandably, some may choose to nix this reunion altogether, deciding instead to keep their beloved duo in the past where they seemed to belong most comfortably. But for those of you who are brave enough to give this film a try, you'll probably find it enjoyable -- nothing worth re-watching, or keeping in the DVD collection for years to come, but certainly a fun couple of hours spent relaxing and reminiscing with Moore and Harper, so familiar, it's almost like reuniting with old friends ourselves.",3,Almost like catching up with old friends ourselves...,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,1370,"['Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'reunite', '2000', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'where', 'reprise', 'old', 'characters', 'beloved', 'long-running', '1970s', 'series', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'reasons', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'other', 'life', 'got', 'way', 'women', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'touch', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'Now', 'Mary', 'Rhoda', 'are', 'conveniently', 'single', 'again', 'New', 'York', 'mothers', 'college-aged', 'daughters', ""'re"", 'having', 'trouble', 'respective', 'careers', 'life', 'general', 'women', 'hovering', 'next', 'phase', 'lives', 'need', 'one', 'support', 'more', 'ever.Diehard', 'fans', 'MTM', 'will', 'have', 'ignore', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'simply', 'concentrate', 'actors', 'characters', 'loved', 'having', 'together', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'better', 'not', 'having', 'together', ""n't"", 'Understandably', 'may', 'choose', 'nix', 'reunion', 'altogether', 'deciding', 'instead', 'keep', 'beloved', 'duo', 'past', 'where', 'seemed', 'belong', 'most', 'comfortably', 'who', 'are', 'brave', 'enough', 'give', 'film', 'try', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'nothing', 'worth', 're-watching', 'keeping', 'DVD', 'collection', 'years', 'come', 'certainly', 'fun', 'couple', 'hours', 'spent', 'relaxing', 'reminiscing', 'Moore', 'Harper', 'so', 'familiar', 'almost', 'reuniting', 'old', 'friends']",N/A

The Rhoda and Mary I knew, were ""best"" friends and joked and wisecracked throughout the show.  This movie was so-o-o-o-o boring!  Even the beginning when they meet up again after years of separation, was so like ""Do I know you?!""  Rhoda and Mary were the first ""Girlfriends""--they lived in each other's apartment, took classes together, borrowed each others clothes, held each others hand through a crisis or a ""bad"" date, and even had little spats.  They have a history and it didn't show at all in this movie.  Plus, they both lacked the energy that they used to have.  It didn't have anything to do with their aging--their characters and the script were just plain boring!  I'm surprised Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper even agreed to give this movie to their fans of 30 years!  I thought they would be mature, savvy, experienced, and entertaining like ""Maude"" or the ""Golden Girls.""
