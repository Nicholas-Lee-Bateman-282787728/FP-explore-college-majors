Taylor,"[8, 8]","Comment: I have to laugh when I hear these people reciting bogus information about 3D and the wearing of ""goofy"" glasses from so called ""technical reporters"" that formed their opinion based on a brief  viewing in a crowded noisy convention, rather than living with a 3D TV in their homes for awhile. These same people will stand in line for hours and spend $18 apiece (not to mention the cast of food) to get in. That same 3D experience (or better) can be had any time they want (with their family) for the cost of one admission. This family movie is a case in point. It is family entertainment on all levels. The jokes are great... the story is ""lesson learning""... and the 3D effect is wonderful with the occasional surprise. It is probably a little mild for teenagers and ""tweensters"" but if it's a wholesome funny politically correct family movie your looking for, this is it... it's ""smarter than the average bear... right Boo Boo""?",5,Great 3D...

Then again, maybe not.  Do you really feel like you've been missing Yogi Bear all these years?  Nah, didn't think so!Before going into it, I was asking myself ""How in the world can the writers come up with a storyline that will last 80 minutes?"" and... they somehow do.  They do it by having the plot mostly revolve around the crooked, greedy mayor with his sarcastic demeanor and superiority complex- he takes up about as much space as Yogi does.Yogi never goes anywhere without his pal Boo Boo (the little adorable bear).I was also interested in how Yogi and Boo Boo would communicate with the people (not really remembering how it was done in the cartoon- hey it's been at least 15 years since I watched the cartoon).  It turns out the people understand Yogi's voice, but label him as a clueless moron always attempting to steal picnic baskets (and just food overall) but never managing to accomplish it for some reason or another.On a sidenote, I was almost expecting Yogi Bear to reach major fortune and fame when it was discovered by thousands of people that he's a talking bear which would have transformed the storyline isn't something else entirely, but it never occurred (perhaps an idea for a sequel?)I find it funny that Yogi constantly gets criticized as an idiot and yet, he has this special talent to create flying devices and other things.  Yeah I'm sure just any ol' person can do that (sarcasm!!)Anyway, the storyline.  The mayor wants to rip down the forest and make it more like a city park.  This guy is a real jerk- it's all about rolling in the green stuff (money) to him, and nothing else.  It's up to Yogi and Boo Boo (and the Ranger who's just as skinny and dimwitted as I remember) to stop the mayor, save the park, and everyone's happy.My feelings with the way the storyline develops is that it's slow at first, but as the story moves forward the adventurous aspect takes over (especially when a raft ride down the Yellowstone waterfall segment makes an appearance) and this is when the film finally wins me over.  However this particular scene doesn't come until nearly 50-60 minutes into the movie, which means the first half of the film is mostly occupied with clever attempts at stealing food on the part of Yogi and Boo Boo, or with the mayor continuing forward with his evil, unsympathetic scheme.Overall, Yogi Bear is pretty good.  A few underwhelming scenes thanks to a slow beginning aside, the rest of the film makes me a supporter.",4,another missing basket- where did it go?,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,2600,"['Bear', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'definitely', 'intended', 'children', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'nostalgic', 'level', 'perhaps', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not', 'Do', 'really', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'missing', 'Yogi', 'Bear', 'years', 'Nah', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'going', 'was', 'asking', 'How', 'world', 'can', 'writers', 'come', 'up', 'storyline', 'will', 'last', '80', 'minutes', 'somehow', 'do', 'do', 'having', 'plot', 'mostly', 'revolve', 'crooked', 'greedy', 'mayor', 'sarcastic', 'demeanor', 'superiority', 'complex-', 'up', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'space', 'Yogi', 'does.Yogi', 'never', 'anywhere', 'pal', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'little', 'adorable', 'bear', '.I', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'how', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'would', 'communicate', 'people', 'not', 'really', 'remembering', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'cartoon-', 'hey', 'been', 'least', '15', 'years', 'watched', 'cartoon', 'out', 'people', 'understand', 'Yogi', 'voice', 'clueless', 'moron', 'always', 'attempting', 'steal', 'picnic', 'baskets', 'just', 'food', 'overall', 'never', 'managing', 'accomplish', 'reason', 'another.On', 'sidenote', 'was', 'almost', 'expecting', 'Yogi', 'Bear', 'reach', 'major', 'fortune', 'fame', 'when', 'was', 'discovered', 'thousands', 'people', 'talking', 'bear', 'would', 'have', 'transformed', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'never', 'occurred', 'perhaps', 'idea', 'sequel', 'find', 'Yogi', 'constantly', 'criticized', 'idiot', 'yet', 'special', 'talent', 'create', 'flying', 'devices', 'other', 'things', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'ol', 'person', 'can', 'do', 'sarcasm', 'Anyway', 'storyline', 'mayor', 'rip', 'down', 'forest', 'make', 'more', 'city', 'park', 'guy', 'real', 'jerk-', 'rolling', 'green', 'stuff', 'money', 'nothing', 'else', 'up', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'Ranger', 'who', 'just', 'skinny', 'dimwitted', 'remember', 'stop', 'mayor', 'save', 'park', 'everyone', 'happy.My', 'feelings', 'way', 'storyline', 'slow', 'first', 'story', 'forward', 'adventurous', 'aspect', 'especially', 'when', 'raft', 'ride', 'Yellowstone', 'waterfall', 'segment', 'appearance', 'when', 'film', 'finally', 'However', 'particular', 'scene', ""n't"", 'come', 'nearly', '50-60', 'minutes', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'mostly', 'occupied', 'clever', 'attempts', 'stealing', 'food', 'part', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'mayor', 'continuing', 'forward', 'evil', 'unsympathetic', 'scheme.Overall', 'Yogi', 'Bear', 'pretty', 'good', 'few', 'underwhelming', 'scenes', 'thanks', 'slow', 'beginning', 'aside', 'rest', 'film', 'supporter']",N/A

1314064,A17UBY9JDNLEL3,B002ZG99WW,G. Chenoweth,"[10, 19]","Well, I went to an advanced screening of the new Yogi Bear movie and I loved it. It is a very funny film with lots of laugh-out-loud moments. I took my 11 year old son with me and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. As we were leaving the cinema, we were both going back and forth over all the lines from the movie. I think the animators did a great job with Yogi and Boo Boo. Dan Ackroyd did a good job with Yogi and Justin Timberlake was fantastic as Boo Boo. Speaking of the little buddy, in the commercials Boo Boo seems a little smarmy but in the film he is the same ol' Boo Boo that we all know and love. The story line is pretty weak but the antics of Yogi and Boo Boo help make up for it.As a matter of fact, the weakest part is the human actors. Yogi and Boo Boo were always dead on perfect and funny during their scenes. However, Tom Cavanagh is weak as Ranger Smith. Instead of chasing after Yogi and getting all upset at Yogi's antics, Tom took the opposite approach: Yogi will be Yogi and there's nothing I can do about it. Anna Faris is a good love interest for Ranger Smith. The first twenty minutes of the film, when they are setting up the plot, is the slowest part of the film because it is mostly Cavanagh, Faris and the villain, Mr. Mayor. Once the set up is done, though, it is pure antics and hilarity throughout the rest of the film.I am very biased because I have been a big Huck and Yogi fan all of my life and it is great to see an H-B character in a big budget film that works. After the film, I turned to the guy next to me (not my son) and said, ""What did you think?"" His reaction was the same as mine that it was a great film and a terrific Yogi Bear movie. Everyone in the theater were laughing uproariously at the film and gave the film a huge applause at the end, so it wasn't just me.I loathe the three TV films from the 80's (Yogi's Great Escape, Yogi Bear/Spruce Goose and Yogi/Space Bears). They were awful. Yogi's First Christmas is a just a step above these three but not by much. However, this film is probably the best Yogi Bear showing since ""Hey There, It's Yogi Bear"" and this is no exaggeration.

1314067,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002ZG99WW,Haunted Flower,"[4, 20]","""Yogi Bear"" was not the worst movie of 2010. But it would make my revised top 10 list of the worst. It was the second movie of 2010 that featured some animated animals and a message about protecting the environment, but it still wasn't as bad as the other movie which WAS the worst movie of 2010 -- ""Furry Vengeance"". Any movie that is so awful throughout AND ends with a lame musical dancing number showing off Brendan Frasier in ill-fitting women's message-on-the-butt pants earns a remarkable level of suckage.The premise is that two super smart bears who wear accessories like to steal pic-a-nic baskets in Jellystone Park. Head Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) and Ranger Jones (T.J. Miller) attempt to keep the peace around the park. Anna Faris arrives as Rachel, a documentary filmmaker who wishes to film the bears and serves as Ranger Smith's love interest. Oh no! Enter corrupt Mayor Brown (Andrew Daly) and his Chief of Staff (Nathan Corddry) who are trying to shut down the park! Can the Rangers, Rachel, and the bears team up to make the 100th anniversary awesome and keep the park running? Fat chance. Lucky for them there's a cute turtle involved.I originally boycotted ""Yogi Bear"" on principle. I loved the cartoon and was afraid to see what would happen to it like with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"", ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"", ""Garfield"" and other cartoons of my youth (I look forward to the ""Smurfs"" movie with utter dread). This movie? It's pretty lame, feels fake even for an audience of young children, and the only mild enjoyment one can get out of it is, ""Awww, look at how cute the frog-mouthed turtle is!"" This is a cartoon NEVER meant for live action interpretation. A smart bear and his sidekick that steal pic-a-nic baskets? I don't even know anyone that owns a pic-a-nic basket. Just like the other cartoon movies turned live action, this is just taking something successfully established and nostalgic and trying to translate it to a new audience while roping in the old one out of curiosity and doesn't take great care in doing so. Why else would Yogi and Boo Boo dance to ""I Like Big Butts""? It's a one off joke meant to make people laugh but totally doesn't fit with their original characters.I will give props to Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake for voicing Yogi Bear and Boo Boo because they do sound VERY similar to the original character's voices. I can't fault any of the actors for joining in a poorly written project for a paycheck, but I can blame some of the live action actors for playing down to the audience so far that it never feels honest. Of course, there are challenges in playing to CGI characters that you don't see, but that has never stopped other better films like ""Paul"" from succeeding in that regard.Christopher Lloyd over at The Film Yap called this movie the worst of last year. I think the only reason it beat out movies like ""Furry Vengeance"" for him is his secret doppleganger, Andrew Daly. Daly's Mayor Brown is a villain so dastardly that he is willing to demolish a protected national park to put in a design your own donut shop or something. I first came across Andrew Daly watching ""Eastbound & Down"" and nearly spit out my food when I saw the resemblance to our friend at the Film Yap! Plus he is a blond villain and Lloyd has spoken out time and time again of the cliche that blond guys are villains and never heroes.Andrew DalyChris LloydBonus Features:A typical animated kids' movie Blu-ray complete with exploration of the Jellystone National Park that leads to interviews with cast and crew members talking about their love for the original cartoon with clips from it (though if I'm being perfectly honest, a few of them look spaced out like they might be on something...).  They talk about how they got the location for the forest, the development of the turtle, working with bears that weren't there, outtakes from a commercial for Mayor Brown, the full song for Rachel, an ad to come visit Jellystone Park, and T.J. Miller's audition with a real bear.

A 7 minute segment switching between the movie and cartoon series.- Good story line. Again, nothing blockbuster here, but it could have been much worse- Corny, funny jokes for all ages. A few snickers for everyone.- Anna Faris. She is hilarious and added a nice bit of comedy in this role without even really trying.Cons- Short. It didn't even hit the 1 20 mark on my DVD player (unless you include credits).- Some things that were meant to be funny weren't.

1314082,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B002ZG99WW,Marshall Lord,"[0, 0]","This review is based on having watched the film at home on Blu-ray with my family.Warner brothers, with Dan Aykroyd voicing Yogi Bear and Justin Timberlake voicing his sidekick Boo Boo, have done a magnificent job of recreating the old Hannah Barbara cartoon series about the rascally bear of ""Jellystone Park."" This 80 minute film is very true to the spirit of the original and had both the adults and children in my family in fits of laughter. The human characters are shown in live action: the animation of Yogi, Boo Boo and special effects is so well done that you have to watch the extras if you want to work out where live action stops and computer generated images begin. Even in High Definition I couldn't see the joins.The film starts with Yogi up to his usual tricks which will be familiar to anyone who watched the original, trying to steal ""pic-a-nic baskets"" from the visitors to the park, with the head ranger (Tom Cavanagh) trying to stop him. Shortly thereafter a wildlife film maker, Rachel Johnson (Anna Faris) arrives, wanting to film the unusual creatures who live at Jellystone. And then a cartoonishly evil politician, Mayor and Gubernatorial candidate Brown (Andrew Daly) comes up with a plot to close Jellystone and cut down all the trees. It will need all of Yogi's daft ingenuity and the efforts of the Ranger and Rachel working together to save the park ...Even more than the original this film is silly but exceptionally entertaining fantasy. It was like watching a cartoon in live action, and although the film piles layer on layer of impossibilities it was extremely easy to suspend disbelief while watching the film and just enjoy it.Quality of the visual images was superb, and the acting was excellent. Aykroyd and Timberlake wonderfully brought the talking bears to life, Cavanagh, Faris and T.J. Miller as the assistant ranger were excellent as supporting characters and Daly, with Nathan Corddry as his sycophantic assistant, made an effective villain.A treat for both present day kids and forty or fiftysomething ""big kids"" reliving their childhood.",5,Superb modern version of the classic children's cartoon,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,2086,"['review', 'based', 'having', 'watched', 'film', 'home', 'Blu-ray', 'family.Warner', 'brothers', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'voicing', 'Yogi', 'Bear', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'voicing', 'sidekick', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'have', 'done', 'magnificent', 'job', 'recreating', 'old', 'Hannah', 'Barbara', 'cartoon', 'series', 'rascally', 'bear', 'Jellystone', 'Park', '80', 'minute', 'film', 'very', 'true', 'spirit', 'original', 'had', 'adults', 'children', 'family', 'fits', 'laughter', 'human', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'live', 'action', 'animation', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'special', 'effects', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'watch', 'extras', 'want', 'work', 'out', 'where', 'live', 'action', 'stops', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'begin', 'Even', 'High', 'Definition', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'joins.The', 'film', 'Yogi', 'up', 'usual', 'tricks', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'original', 'trying', 'steal', 'pic-a-nic', 'baskets', 'visitors', 'park', 'head', 'ranger', 'Tom', 'Cavanagh', 'trying', 'stop', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'wildlife', 'film', 'maker', 'Rachel', 'Johnson', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'wanting', 'film', 'unusual', 'creatures', 'who', 'live', 'Jellystone', 'then', 'cartoonishly', 'evil', 'politician', 'Mayor', 'Gubernatorial', 'candidate', 'Brown', 'Andrew', 'Daly', 'up', 'plot', 'close', 'Jellystone', 'cut', 'down', 'trees', 'will', 'need', 'Yogi', 'daft', 'ingenuity', 'efforts', 'Ranger', 'Rachel', 'working', 'together', 'save', 'park', 'Even', 'more', 'original', 'film', 'silly', 'exceptionally', 'entertaining', 'fantasy', 'was', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'piles', 'layer', 'layer', 'impossibilities', 'was', 'extremely', 'easy', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'watching', 'film', 'just', 'enjoy', 'it.Quality', 'visual', 'images', 'was', 'superb', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'Aykroyd', 'Timberlake', 'wonderfully', 'brought', 'talking', 'bears', 'life', 'Cavanagh', 'Faris', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'assistant', 'ranger', 'were', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Daly', 'Nathan', 'Corddry', 'sycophantic', 'assistant', 'made', 'effective', 'villain.A', 'treat', 'present', 'day', 'kids', 'forty', 'fiftysomething', 'big', 'kids', 'reliving', 'childhood']",N/A

If they have to hook up pic-a-nic tables themselves, to a vehicle and get the baskets that way, they'll do it.They never give up, and there's a good natured lesson to be learned there.The film is full of scenes of a sunshine filled Jellystone Park, it is a happy movie, a movie meant to entertain and provide fun to the audience and it hits a home run in doing that.The scene where Yogi and Boo Boo dance and shake their groove things: Cute and Great.The fireworks scene: Hilarious.The ""limo window challenged"" Mayor: A riot.The so called movie ""critics"" and less than stellar box office numbers notwithstanding, this is a great movie that the whole family will love.It brings Yogi and Boo Boo to life like never before, and I love this movie more than the cartoons.I hope there will be more movies.Throw in a nerdy but funny Mr. Ranger and a funny, cute ""Movie lady"" played by the lovable Anna Faris, and what do you have?A pic-a-nic basket full of goodies, and dreams that come true.Verdict: Two pic-a-nic baskets up!!",5,A Basket full of fun.,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,1615,"['love', 'movie.There', 'something', 'doesnt', 'get', 'old', 'have', 'watched', '15', 'times', 'still', 'feel', ""'m"", 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'whenever', 'watch', 'again', 'taking', 'fun', 'trip', 'Jellystone', 'over', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'forever', 'friendship', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'are', 'charming', 'great', 'team', 'compliment', 'other', 'better', 'Abbott/Costello', 'Cheech/Chong', 'Laurel/Hardy', 'etc', 'were', 'great', 'teams.The', 'movie', 'fun', 'adventure', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'stop', 'nothing', 'swipe', 'pic-a-nic', 'basket', 'have', 'fly', 'will', 'have', 'hook', 'up', 'pic-a-nic', 'tables', 'vehicle', 'get', 'baskets', 'way', ""'ll"", 'do', 'it.They', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'good', 'natured', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'there.The', 'film', 'full', 'scenes', 'sunshine', 'filled', 'Jellystone', 'Park', 'happy', 'movie', 'movie', 'meant', 'entertain', 'provide', 'fun', 'audience', 'home', 'run', 'doing', 'that.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'dance', 'shake', 'groove', 'things', 'Cute', 'Great.The', 'fireworks', 'scene', 'Hilarious.The', 'limo', 'window', 'challenged', 'Mayor', 'riot.The', 'so', 'called', 'movie', 'critics', 'less', 'stellar', 'box', 'office', 'numbers', 'notwithstanding', 'great', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'love.It', 'brings', 'Yogi', 'Boo', 'Boo', 'life', 'never', 'love', 'movie', 'more', 'cartoons.I', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'movies.Throw', 'nerdy', 'funny', 'Mr.', 'Ranger', 'funny', 'cute', 'Movie', 'lady', 'played', 'lovable', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'pic-a-nic', 'basket', 'full', 'goodies', 'come', 'true.Verdict', 'Two', 'pic-a-nic', 'baskets', 'up']",N/A

I skipped this one at the theaters, but decided to get this on blu-ray 3D with my new 3D tv. Well the concept of yogi bear and his side kick booboo (bobo?, whatever...) was fun to revisit. They could have made this a ""MUCH BETTER"" movie by having better actors play the two leading human roles, the park ranger and the girl. Too bad they did not get more well known actors, better actors for the human parts. Dan Aykroyd would have been good for the park ranger, and he could have played both the yogi voice and the human ranger part as well. But beyond poor leading human roles, the movie has great 3D. When they were standing in the water waist deep, you felt like you were in the water too. That was a very good 3D effect. So yes! this movie is worth getting. And more so if you have kids or children. PLUS... almost as good as the movie itself is the bonus feature 3D cartoon THE ROAD RUNNER. Now THAT was a good ROAD RUNNER (beep beep) cartoon. AND IN 3D TOO !!! We never got that at the kiddie saturday movies in our youth, a """"3D"""" road runner cartoon!I'd love to see more ROAD RUNNER 3D cartoons.
