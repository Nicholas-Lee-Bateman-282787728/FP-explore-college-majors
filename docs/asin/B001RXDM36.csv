1234615,AG5ND5SXXL0AV,B001RXDM36,"Blue Mendolence ""Blue""","[3, 7]","If this film has a good feature, it is probably the landscape photography. But it ends there. Along with a disjointed storyline that frequently leaves the viewer hanging (how did the girl get out of the cave?), the film is nothing more than a series of episodes strung together in the editing room. It is so clumsily put together, it wouldn't pass muster as a student's first year film project. If there is a story, it is this: A child becomes fixated on a fox that keeps trying to evade it. The child's obsessive curiosity at times borders on stalking and the claimed ""friendship"" between the girl and the fox is never adequately proven.Genuine nature films, or films that use real animals, are notoriously difficult to film. And the abrupt-style photography in this film demonstrates, without any doubt, that the interactions between fox and child (and several other animal scenes) were created in the cutting room. The dubbed dialogue is pedestrian and Kate Winslet's narration neither helps nor hinders--it's just there. Even the ""trapped fox"" event seemed like a desperate ploy by the filmmaker to inject some badly needed drama into this surprisingly stodgy film. The girl's bizarre decision to trap the fox in her room--and cause the panicked animal to get almost killed by crashing through a window--very much contradicts the idea there is a friendship between them at all. By movie's end, the girl demonstrates no maturation, no learning curve, and yet she suddenly parrots the script writer's words that ""foxes and people cannot be friends."" This gratuitously injected dialogue, of course, completely undermines the film's heavily advertised premise that they can be.I am totally baffled by the largely positive professional reviews of this film. I read these AFTER, not before seeing this film, and I'm at a loss at the saccharine adjectives of praise in many of them. I watched this wretched movie with guests, who, like I, were hoping the movie would turn around and show some of the ""magic"" promised on the DVD jacket.Sadly, this movie now tops my list of worst films ever.

1234617,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001RXDM36,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[36, 39]","The definition of what family entertainment is all about - a lovable story, absolutely stunning scenery, and perfect photography - that is meant for everyone. The film is narrated wonderfully by Kate Winslet. She has a special wonderful sweet voice, that is never sappy.This is the story of a girl who befriends a fox. It's the slow getting to know eachother, the dance where they both mistrust each other, build to trust, and then a realization that this is a wild animal that should fear humans. Almost the classic love story.The synopsis really misses out on the spectacular scenery, the images of nature, the gorgeous animals, and the incredible sound. From the film credits, most of the locations are in Ain, a small town north of Lyon / East of Macon, France. This is the beginning of the French Alps, the foothills where there is a variety of landscape from fields to fairly high mountains (green all the way to the top though). The forests are green and lush, the snow amazing, the fall colors superb; it's a perfect filming location. The animal scenes are stunning, how they did this filming is frequently impossible to understand - simply amazing they got those shots. The sound was almost another character - birds, rain, thunder, woodpeckers, every sound imaginable in the woods was recorded clearly.Luc Jacquet (did an outstanding job directing this film. He is best known for March of the Penguins (March of the Penguins (Widescreen Edition)). And this film follows in the same mold, he understands how to tell animal stories, capture them on film, and translate them into a movie. Isabelle Noel-Bruneau is the sweet redheaded star of the movie along side the fox. They make a beautiful couple.Most will think, G rated nature film, why would I care? This movie very gradually pulls you in with beautiful scenery, and Kate Winslet's gorgeous voice. The story builds gradually and you begin to care very much about what happens to the fox. It's a classic story told in a straighforward manner.There is a subtle feeling of Jean Craighead George in this film, (My Side of the Mountain Trilogy (My Side of the Mountain / On the Far Side of the Mountain / Frightful's Mountain)). Studying nature and trying to understand what nature says to us.The movie is rated G. Everyone should enjoy this film. 1/27/2010 Update - the following paragraph reveals the ending of the film. For the sensitive child, very near the end of the film the fox is in the girl's room and feels trapped. It runs all over the room and eventually crashes through the window. You are expected to believe the fox has died. The girl carries it to the woods. That might be a bit tough for some children who have very sensitive parents. I mention this only because of the flack from Marley and Me, with the ending. This scene is not as intense, but there is an animal that appears to die. Some parents may feel obliged to protect their children.If there is one small problem with the DVD - there is only one language available. The film is presented in English. I would have liked the option to have French with subtitles. The DVD also does not include a making of featurette. As much as I hate those, I sure would have enjoyed seeing this particular making of.A gorgeous film that everyone should love.",5,"Remarkable, Gorgeous Film",1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,3278,"['definition', 'what', 'family', 'entertainment', 'lovable', 'story', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'scenery', 'perfect', 'photography', 'meant', 'everyone', 'film', 'narrated', 'wonderfully', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'special', 'wonderful', 'sweet', 'voice', 'never', 'sappy.This', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'fox', 'slow', 'getting', 'know', 'eachother', 'dance', 'where', 'mistrust', 'other', 'build', 'trust', 'then', 'realization', 'wild', 'animal', 'should', 'fear', 'humans', 'Almost', 'classic', 'love', 'story.The', 'synopsis', 'really', 'out', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'images', 'nature', 'gorgeous', 'animals', 'incredible', 'sound', 'film', 'credits', 'most', 'locations', 'are', 'Ain', 'small', 'town', 'north', 'Lyon', '/', 'East', 'Macon', 'France', 'beginning', 'French', 'Alps', 'foothills', 'where', 'variety', 'landscape', 'fields', 'fairly', 'high', 'mountains', 'green', 'way', 'top', 'though', 'forests', 'are', 'green', 'lush', 'snow', 'amazing', 'fall', 'colors', 'superb', 'perfect', 'filming', 'location', 'animal', 'scenes', 'are', 'stunning', 'how', 'did', 'filming', 'frequently', 'impossible', 'understand', 'simply', 'amazing', 'got', 'shots', 'sound', 'was', 'almost', 'character', 'birds', 'rain', 'thunder', 'woodpeckers', 'sound', 'imaginable', 'woods', 'was', 'recorded', 'clearly.Luc', 'Jacquet', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'best', 'known', 'March', 'Penguins', 'March', 'Penguins', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'film', 'same', 'mold', 'how', 'tell', 'animal', 'stories', 'capture', 'film', 'translate', 'movie', 'Isabelle', 'Noel-Bruneau', 'sweet', 'redheaded', 'star', 'movie', 'side', 'fox', 'make', 'beautiful', 'couple.Most', 'will', 'think', 'G', 'rated', 'nature', 'film', 'why', 'would', 'care', 'movie', 'very', 'gradually', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'gorgeous', 'voice', 'story', 'gradually', 'begin', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'fox', 'classic', 'story', 'told', 'straighforward', 'manner.There', 'subtle', 'feeling', 'Jean', 'Craighead', 'George', 'film', 'My', 'Side', 'Mountain', 'Trilogy', 'My', 'Side', 'Mountain', '/', 'Far', 'Side', 'Mountain', '/', 'Frightful', 'Mountain', 'Studying', 'nature', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'nature', 'us.The', 'movie', 'rated', 'G.', 'Everyone', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film', '1/27/2010', 'Update', 'following', 'paragraph', 'ending', 'film', 'sensitive', 'child', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'fox', 'girl', 'room', 'feels', 'trapped', 'room', 'eventually', 'crashes', 'window', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'fox', 'died', 'girl', 'woods', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'tough', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'sensitive', 'parents', 'mention', 'only', 'flack', 'Marley', 'Me', 'ending', 'scene', 'not', 'intense', 'animal', 'die', 'parents', 'may', 'feel', 'obliged', 'protect', 'children.If', 'one', 'small', 'problem', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'language', 'available', 'film', 'presented', 'English', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'option', 'have', 'French', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'also', 'not', 'include', 'making', 'featurette', 'As', 'much', 'hate', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'particular', 'making', 'of.A', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'love']",The Fox and the Child

1234620,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B001RXDM36,Enjolras,"[3, 4]","Luc Jacquet has done it again. While this film's locale and wildlife could not be more different fromMarch of the Penguins, it manages to capture that sense of humanity in animals.The movie is half documentary/half children's tale, but has enough of both to satisfy all audiences. The film had some amazing footage of foxes and other wildlife. In one scene, a Bobcat chased the vixen through the forests, and the camera team caught most of the chase. I've seen just about every David Attenborough documentary made and many others, but my jaw was left gaping by that sequence. The chase was extremely fast-paced and through pretty dense woods, yet Jacquet's team caught it. There are also some beautiful shots of foxes standing in front of a full moon.The children's movie half is very subtle and involves the girl (Bertille Nol-Bruneau) getting to know the fox and, ultimately, the realities of nature. The story has the sort of child's wisdom that readers ofThe Little Prince(itself another French classic) will recognize. Bertille doesn't just scoop the fox up as a pet, but ultimately realizes that her vixen friend is a wild animal who lives in nature, and that their friendship must be on the fox's terms, not humanity's. In short, the movie's them is that love does not equal possession. Kids in America today, spoiled and overprotected, could learn a thing or two from this film.At many points, I wondered where the nature documentary ended and where the fictional story began. The two genres flowed together seamlessly in the film. At many points, Bertille gets closer to dangerous animals such as brown bears and wolves than David Attenborough ever would. I would love to have seen a ""making of"" featurette for his movie.The only drawback: Kate Winslet as the narrator. I'm not a fan of her voice (too husky) and though the girl (who incidentally had a charming voice) could have done the narration far better. Better yet, the DVD should have included an option to have the original french narrator, Isabelle Carre, with English subtitles.In short, this would be a great gift for families with kids, or wildlife enthusiasts who are young at heart.",5,A heartwarming documentary of animals that live right outside,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,2156,"['Luc', 'Jacquet', 'done', 'again', 'film', 'locale', 'wildlife', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'fromMarch', 'Penguins', 'capture', 'sense', 'humanity', 'animals.The', 'movie', 'half', 'documentary/half', 'children', 'tale', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'audiences', 'film', 'had', 'amazing', 'footage', 'foxes', 'other', 'wildlife', 'one', 'scene', 'Bobcat', 'chased', 'vixen', 'forests', 'camera', 'team', 'caught', 'most', 'chase', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'documentary', 'made', 'many', 'others', 'jaw', 'was', 'left', 'gaping', 'sequence', 'chase', 'was', 'extremely', 'fast-paced', 'pretty', 'dense', 'woods', 'Jacquet', 'team', 'caught', 'are', 'also', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'foxes', 'standing', 'front', 'full', 'moon.The', 'children', 'movie', 'half', 'very', 'subtle', 'girl', 'Bertille', 'Nol-Bruneau', 'getting', 'know', 'fox', 'ultimately', 'realities', 'nature', 'story', 'sort', 'child', 'wisdom', 'ofThe', 'Little', 'Prince', 'French', 'classic', 'will', 'recognize', 'Bertille', ""n't"", 'just', 'scoop', 'fox', 'up', 'pet', 'ultimately', 'vixen', 'friend', 'wild', 'animal', 'who', 'nature', 'friendship', 'must', 'be', 'fox', 'terms', 'not', 'humanity', 'short', 'movie', 'love', 'not', 'equal', 'possession', 'Kids', 'America', 'today', 'spoiled', 'overprotected', 'could', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'film.At', 'many', 'points', 'wondered', 'where', 'nature', 'documentary', 'ended', 'where', 'fictional', 'story', 'began', 'two', 'genres', 'flowed', 'together', 'seamlessly', 'film', 'many', 'points', 'Bertille', 'closer', 'dangerous', 'animals', 'such', 'brown', 'bears', 'wolves', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'ever', 'would', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'making', 'featurette', 'movie.The', 'only', 'drawback', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'narrator', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'voice', 'too', 'husky', 'girl', 'who', 'incidentally', 'had', 'charming', 'voice', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'narration', 'far', 'better', 'Better', 'yet', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'option', 'have', 'original', 'french', 'narrator', 'Isabelle', 'Carre', 'English', 'subtitles.In', 'short', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'gift', 'families', 'kids', 'wildlife', 'enthusiasts', 'who', 'are', 'young', 'heart']",The Fox and the Child

WHY ???25 years ago I moved to South Florida.  I was a young man and I guess looking for a bit more excitement and job opportunities.Now I will confess, 25 years ago I thought South Florida was a tropical paradise and I would probably live there my whole life.I got into SCUBA diving, boating, beaches, the pool in the backyard , and the warm winters that make you forget Winter even exists.  It's been great !But fast forward to today ..........Over the past year or two my wife and I agree something FEELS different.South Florida today does not feel like the same place we moved to 25 years ago.Yes, we all know nothing stays the same and everyplace changes ......... but the way this place has changed is Exponential.From population growth, demographic shift, traffic, urbanization, orange groves & farms eliminated and replaced with housing developments and over 240 new people PER DAY moving into the area, .................... We Came To A Sad Conclusion ....Our South Florida Is Gone !As a result, we recently purchased 120 acres of land in the Mountains up North only 60-70 miles from where we both grew up.It seems like coming full circle in life.I realize now the things we enjoy best are quiet seclusion and isolation out in nature and NOT the urbanized and mechanized world of zero lot lines, rude neighbors, light polluted night skies and a constant drone of ambient city noise.Now I know my personal story is of little interest to 99.9999% of you, but I told it only because it relates to the review of this movie.When watching this movie I started to think of how MOST kids grow up today .... Surrounded by tightly packed neighborhoods, I-PODS, Satellite TV and almost NO IDEA what nature is really like outside of TV shoes and the local park.Heck when we were kids, we ran around all day long on ""Tom Sawyer - like"" adventures and our parents did not know (or worry) what we were doing as long as we made it home by 6:30 for Supper.Now parents fear letting kids out of the yard for fear of pedophiles and other modern day social problems.Technological advances sure are great and wonderful --  but it does not always seem our Social, Moral and Ethical aspects of life keep progressing at an equal pace.So I watch this movie and wonder how few young people will ever understand this connection to nature in a world where the population seems to double every 10 years, it becomes harder and harder to escape Urbanization and people are forced to live on top of each other in tighter and tighter living arrangements.I can imagine a person born and raised in New York City who grew up to work on Wall Street, and with no life experiences outside the City seeing THE FOX AND THE CHILD and thinking it silly and childish.For somebody like me that has had the opportunity to live in both worlds, I found myself envious of the little girl in the film as it made me recall my earlier days.It also motivates me to work harder and faster to build a home on our recently acquired land so that I may be able to recapture some of that connection with nature I lost 23 years ago when I moved to the bigger, faster city way of life.I call it ""coming full circle"" and I hope I will be able to spend much of my last 20-30 years on Earth much like the story of nature depicted in this simple, well filmed, children's movie.A final note on the movie .... The ending (which I will not ruin with spoilers) teaches a lesson to younger children without being too dark and shocking.There is also a deeper symbolic meeting in the movie for adults.",5,A simple G-rated movie that brings you back to roots.,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,4502,"['Being', 'almost', '47', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'watched', 'G-Rated', 'movie', 'enjoyed.THE', 'FOX', 'THE', 'CHILD', 'was', 'movie', 'related', 'probably', 'where', 'wife', 'are', 'life.I', 'call', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'youth', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'mid-sized', 'town', 'Virginia.Whenever', 'possible', 'kid', 'even', 'grew', 'up', 'High', 'School', 'College', 'preferred', 'head', 'out', 'Mountains', 'Forest', 'spend', 'time', 'alone', 'nature', 'opposed', 'staying', 'city', 'going', 'malls', 'nightclubs', 'parties.Some', 'fondest', 'memories', 'are', 'hiking', 'top', 'waterfalls', 'where', 'knew', 'probably', 'other', 'people', 'were', '6', 'miles', 'sit', 'rock', 'sun', 'reading', 'books', 'just', 'watching', 'black', 'bear', 'deer', 'other', 'child', 'film', 'remember', '2', 'years', 'kept', 'running', 'same', 'few', 'animals', 'Spring', 'when', 'returned', 'mountains.Until', 'recently', 'had', 'forgotten', 'old', 'memories', 'WHY', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'moved', 'South', 'Florida', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'guess', 'looking', 'bit', 'more', 'excitement', 'job', 'opportunities.Now', 'will', 'confess', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'South', 'Florida', 'was', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'would', 'probably', 'live', 'there', 'whole', 'life.I', 'got', 'SCUBA', 'diving', 'boating', 'beaches', 'pool', 'backyard', 'warm', 'winters', 'make', 'forget', 'Winter', 'even', 'been', 'great', 'fast', 'forward', 'today', 'past', 'year', 'two', 'wife', 'agree', 'something', 'FEELS', 'different.South', 'Florida', 'today', 'not', 'feel', 'same', 'place', 'moved', '25', 'years', 'ago.Yes', 'know', 'nothing', 'same', 'everyplace', 'changes', 'way', 'place', 'changed', 'Exponential.From', 'population', 'growth', 'demographic', 'shift', 'traffic', 'urbanization', 'orange', 'groves', 'farms', 'eliminated', 'replaced', 'housing', 'developments', 'over', '240', 'new', 'people', 'PER', 'DAY', 'moving', 'area', 'Came', 'Sad', 'Conclusion', 'South', 'Florida', 'Gone', 'result', 'recently', 'purchased', '120', 'acres', 'land', 'Mountains', 'up', 'North', 'only', '60-70', 'miles', 'where', 'grew', 'up.It', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'life.I', 'realize', 'now', 'things', 'enjoy', 'best', 'are', 'quiet', 'seclusion', 'isolation', 'out', 'nature', 'NOT', 'urbanized', 'mechanized', 'world', 'zero', 'lot', 'lines', 'rude', 'neighbors', 'light', 'polluted', 'night', 'skies', 'constant', 'drone', 'ambient', 'city', 'noise.Now', 'know', 'personal', 'story', 'little', 'interest', '99.9999', '%', 'told', 'only', 'review', 'movie.When', 'watching', 'movie', 'started', 'think', 'how', 'MOST', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'today', 'Surrounded', 'tightly', 'packed', 'neighborhoods', 'I-PODS', 'Satellite', 'TV', 'almost', 'NO', 'IDEA', 'what', 'nature', 'really', 'like', 'TV', 'shoes', 'local', 'park.Heck', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'ran', 'day', 'long', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'adventures', 'parents', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'worry', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'as', 'long', 'made', 'home', '6:30', 'Supper.Now', 'parents', 'fear', 'letting', 'kids', 'yard', 'fear', 'pedophiles', 'other', 'modern', 'day', 'social', 'problems.Technological', 'advances', 'sure', 'are', 'great', 'wonderful', 'not', 'always', 'seem', 'Social', 'Moral', 'Ethical', 'aspects', 'life', 'keep', 'progressing', 'equal', 'pace.So', 'watch', 'movie', 'wonder', 'how', 'few', 'young', 'people', 'will', 'ever', 'understand', 'connection', 'nature', 'world', 'where', 'population', 'double', '10', 'years', 'harder', 'harder', 'escape', 'Urbanization', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'top', 'other', 'tighter', 'tighter', 'living', 'arrangements.I', 'can', 'imagine', 'person', 'born', 'raised', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'work', 'Wall', 'Street', 'life', 'experiences', 'City', 'seeing', 'THE', 'FOX', 'AND', 'THE', 'CHILD', 'thinking', 'silly', 'childish.For', 'somebody', 'had', 'opportunity', 'live', 'worlds', 'found', 'envious', 'little', 'girl', 'film', 'made', 'recall', 'earlier', 'days.It', 'also', 'work', 'harder', 'faster', 'build', 'home', 'recently', 'acquired', 'land', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'recapture', 'connection', 'nature', 'lost', '23', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'moved', 'bigger', 'faster', 'city', 'way', 'life.I', 'call', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'spend', 'much', 'last', '20-30', 'years', 'Earth', 'much', 'story', 'nature', 'depicted', 'simple', 'well', 'filmed', 'children', 'movie.A', 'final', 'note', 'movie', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'spoilers', 'lesson', 'younger', 'children', 'being', 'too', 'dark', 'shocking.There', 'also', 'deeper', 'symbolic', 'meeting', 'movie', 'adults']",The Fox and the Child

The film is awesomely picturesque and delightful until the last 15 or so minutes. I would not allow young children to view this. It would horrify them and give them nightmares! The little girl (whose parents are mysteriously absent) gains the fox's trust, and so she puts a scarf around the fox's neck and ties a rope to it like one would to a dog. The fox chews off the rope, but the scarf remains on it's neck and it runs away. Next we see the girl coax the fox into her house and up to the second floor of her bedroom. She closes the door. The fox panics. It wants out. She won't let it out. It jumps through the window breaking the glass, and lands on cement two floors down, apparently dead because a selfish girl wants to possess him and control him. It is clear the fox is dead. She carries it to it's den where it's offspring live who aren't fully grown yet. Much later she spies the fox, seeing it alive when she thought it dead. The fox only looks at her in horror and goes on it's way. She decides foxes and humans cannot be friends. An awful film. I do not recommend it at all to anyone.

Luc Jacquet must've been murder to work with because of the quality of the shots that he demanded (most directors would've settled for a simple panning shot of a wild cat chasing the fox in the snow-covered woods, but that wasn't good enough for M. Jacquet: he had to have a marvelous tracking shot of the chase -and, God, was it exciting!  The attention to photographic detail is breath-taking.The story is a lovely, tender film about a girl trying to tame a fox, and learning that a fox is a wild creature and needs its freedom.
