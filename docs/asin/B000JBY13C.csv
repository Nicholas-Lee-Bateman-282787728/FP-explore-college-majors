1026140,AY12DBB0U420B,B000JBY13C,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Not too long ago a ""Pulse: a Stomp Odyssey"" DVD appeared on my Amazon recommended list, perhaps because I had reviewed two Blue Men Group DVDs. In addition, a ""Stomp Live"" DVD recommendation also appeared. Makes sense. In any case, I looked over the information and decided to order both the ""Pulse"" DVD and the ""Stomp Live"" DVD. I had never heard of either DVD prior to the purchase, so the contents were an almost total surprise. I watched and listened to the ""Pulse"" DVD first about a week after it arrived. It's a rather short presentation and I was surprised when it was over.""Pulse"" an interesting DVD, without question. It presents drumming and other percussive music, along with a certain amount of dancing, from all over the world and from widely divergent cultures. The people and the costumes are fun to watch. A possible exception are some of the African presentations. I suspect, under natural conditions the women would have been naked chested, but here they wore a variety of western-style halter tops, perhaps  so as not to offend western audiences. It's a shame. The rhythms the highly varied groups produced were interesting. Some were staged. Many were natural cultural acts. Surely, this type of percussive music and dancing must be saying something fundamental about the nature of human existence.In any case, the DVD presentation was haphazardly organized, in my opinion. Perhaps I missed something, but it's hard to follow any particular thought pattern. I'd like to view some of the groups over a longer span of time and others are much too long. The presentations, to me, seemed much too unorganized and flitted from one thing to another with little integration. Although here and there I find it very interesting. Will I view it again? Perhaps, under some special circumstance. Would I buy the DVD again given a second chance? Probably not. I rated it as three stars, and I could easily be argued up to four, but the shortness and poor organization is the stumbling block.A while later, I viewed the ""Stomp Live"" DVD. and it's a wonderful stage show. If you like percussive music, watch them both by all means. Personally, I found the ""Stomp Live"" DVD to be far superior as a form of entertainment.Gary Peterson",3,Drumming and Other Percussive Music.,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,2237,"['Not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'Pulse', 'Stomp', 'Odyssey', 'DVD', 'appeared', 'Amazon', 'recommended', 'list', 'perhaps', 'had', 'reviewed', 'two', 'Blue', 'Men', 'Group', 'DVDs', 'addition', 'Stomp', 'Live', 'DVD', 'recommendation', 'also', 'appeared', 'Makes', 'sense', 'case', 'looked', 'information', 'decided', 'order', 'Pulse', 'DVD', 'Stomp', 'Live', 'DVD', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'DVD', 'prior', 'purchase', 'contents', 'were', 'almost', 'total', 'surprise', 'watched', 'listened', 'Pulse', 'DVD', 'first', 'week', 'arrived', 'rather', 'short', 'presentation', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'Pulse', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'question', 'drumming', 'other', 'percussive', 'music', 'certain', 'amount', 'dancing', 'world', 'widely', 'divergent', 'cultures', 'people', 'costumes', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'possible', 'exception', 'are', 'African', 'presentations', 'suspect', 'natural', 'conditions', 'women', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'naked', 'chested', 'here', 'wore', 'variety', 'western-style', 'halter', 'tops', 'perhaps', 'so', 'not', 'offend', 'western', 'audiences', 'shame', 'rhythms', 'highly', 'varied', 'groups', 'produced', 'were', 'interesting', 'were', 'staged', 'Many', 'were', 'natural', 'cultural', 'acts', 'Surely', 'type', 'percussive', 'music', 'dancing', 'must', 'be', 'saying', 'something', 'fundamental', 'nature', 'human', 'existence.In', 'case', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'was', 'haphazardly', 'organized', 'opinion', 'Perhaps', 'missed', 'something', 'hard', 'follow', 'particular', 'thought', 'pattern', ""'d"", 'like', 'view', 'groups', 'longer', 'span', 'time', 'others', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'presentations', 'seemed', 'much', 'too', 'unorganized', 'flitted', 'one', 'thing', 'little', 'integration', 'here', 'there', 'find', 'very', 'interesting', 'Will', 'view', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'special', 'circumstance', 'Would', 'buy', 'DVD', 'again', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'Probably', 'not', 'rated', 'three', 'stars', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'argued', 'up', 'four', 'shortness', 'poor', 'organization', 'stumbling', 'block.A', 'later', 'viewed', 'Stomp', 'Live', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'stage', 'show', 'like', 'percussive', 'music', 'watch', 'means', 'Personally', 'found', 'Stomp', 'Live', 'DVD', 'be', 'far', 'superior', 'form', 'entertainment.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

It truly opens a window to the world!The musicians act alone, or in bands. A variety of musical instruments are shown. There are drums almost as big as a man. A woman has an instrument that is whirled above her head on a rope. One scene shows her doing this on the roof of a building in a city, while another shows the natives' use of it at the top of a hill or mountain.For some musicians, their bodies alone are the musical instruments. There is a man who makes an amazing variety of sounds with just his mouth and voice. There is also a woman who stomps out a beat in tap dancing.The sharp-eyed Chicagoan will notice brief glimpses of railway cars of the type used in Chicago subways.

However, this actually was what made it work so well--the music was allowed to speak for itself.This doesn't mean that you have to be a musician or an anthropologist to enjoy it.  On the contrary, the point of the movie, really, is that music exists everywhere--not just on the radio or in concert halls.  Music exists in daily life and is eminently accesible.The film presents music as performed by a number of different cultures: numerous groups throughout Africa, drummers at Carnivale in Brazil,  an Indian religious festival, flamenco dancing in Spain, members of STOMP in the US and Britain, etc.  There is a great diversity in pieces chosen, and each group is unique and interesting.  You will find yourself tapping the beat for the whole show.Another strong point of the film was its showcasing of the meaning of music in many cultures, to bring harmony, as entertainment, honor the gods, bring respite from work, etc.  I found it very interesting to get a peek into these cultures as well.I must have seen this movie ten times, and I brought a different person with me each time.  It's just that good.  Each time I went, I saw a new angle, a new detail in this richly-filmed movie.

I'm so excited that it's finally available!Everything is there, plus some cool extras.However, my excitement is tempered by the following:The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that the film was simply compressed from IMAX down to a letterbox.Everyone looks a bit squished - noticeably wider and shorter than they did in the film.

1026144,ACNUC5ZBYK9OC,B000JBY13C,Richard Middleton,"[0, 0]","I love Stomp (I've seen them live and have another of their DVDs), but I find it hard to rate this DVD.  It is full of amazing music, primarily percussion, of course, but it seems to have been put together on the assumption that devoted fans will love it regardless of quality or coherence.  First, quality.  Reviewers who are rating it on the basis of having seen the IMAX movie are, I think, misleading people: on the DVD many of the images are rather poor definition, and the manipulation to get IMAX to DVD results in distortion in some scenes (the African dancers, for example, seem considerably wider than they ought to be).  Coherence:  it would be unreasonable to expect a story line, but it would be helpful to know something about the performers and their musical traditions.  There are some brief notes, right at the end, but these are virtually illegible (they were probably fine in IMAX).  It's also questionable whether this should be marketed as an 80-minute DVD:  it's actually 41 minutes,.  A lot of extras add another 40 minutes, but these are to a large extent repeats, outtakes or slide shows of the &#34;making of&#34;  -  not normally items that would be counted in the running time (in fairness, I should say that in some cases the extras do contain footage explaining more about the instruments).If I had bought this DVD new I would have felt cheated.  Buying it used, I have a bargain DVD which I shall watch again with great pleasure, but always with regret that it wasn't better done.",3,Wonderful  music - but sloppily presented,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1511,"['love', 'Stomp', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'live', 'have', 'DVDs', 'find', 'hard', 'rate', 'DVD', 'full', 'amazing', 'music', 'primarily', 'percussion', 'course', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'assumption', 'devoted', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'regardless', 'quality', 'coherence', 'First', 'quality', 'Reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'rating', 'basis', 'having', 'seen', 'IMAX', 'movie', 'are', 'think', 'misleading', 'people', 'DVD', 'many', 'images', 'are', 'rather', 'poor', 'definition', 'manipulation', 'get', 'IMAX', 'DVD', 'results', 'distortion', 'scenes', 'African', 'dancers', 'example', 'seem', 'considerably', 'wider', 'ought', 'be', 'Coherence', 'would', 'be', 'unreasonable', 'expect', 'story', 'line', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'know', 'something', 'performers', 'musical', 'traditions', 'are', 'brief', 'notes', 'right', 'end', 'are', 'virtually', 'illegible', 'were', 'probably', 'fine', 'IMAX', 'also', 'questionable', 'should', 'be', 'marketed', '80-minute', 'DVD', 'actually', '41', 'minutes', 'lot', 'extras', 'add', '40', 'minutes', 'are', 'large', 'extent', 'repeats', 'outtakes', 'slide', 'shows', '34', 'making', '34', 'not', 'normally', 'items', 'would', 'be', 'counted', 'running', 'time', 'fairness', 'should', 'say', 'cases', 'extras', 'do', 'contain', 'footage', 'explaining', 'more', 'instruments', '.If', 'had', 'bought', 'DVD', 'new', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'cheated', 'Buying', 'used', 'have', 'bargain', 'DVD', 'shall', 'watch', 'again', 'great', 'pleasure', 'always', 'regret', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'done']",N/A
