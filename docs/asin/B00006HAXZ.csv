The only thing that's remotely interesting is the ending, and it's not something that anyone would write home to mom about.  There is a bit of clever dialogue in the movie as well, mostly coming from Courtney Love's character, but in general this is not really worth your time or money (though it DID have a plot and it DID follow the plot, which is more than can be said for about 90% of the Action movies out in the market today, which is ALSO why it got 2 stars instead of 1).I can't even think of a comparable film that would be better to recommend, as it's not really comparable to much...

If you say no, good for you. For that is the sum of what the film beat is about. The losers are Beatnik charlatans William Burroughs (Kiefer Sutherland), his wife Joan Vollmer (Courtney Love), and their pals Allen Ginsberg (Ron Livingston) and Lucien Carr (Norman Reedus). Ok, Ginsberg at least had talent, but anyone with a brain knows he pissed it away. This is a really bad film, and its poverty starts with aimless direction by Gary Walkow, and a script that is utterly devoid of energy, spark, and wit.The film is basically about the idiotic relationship between bisexual Bill and juiced up Joan, and how he comes to kill her in a drunken game of William Tell with a loaded gun in Mexico City in the 1950s. The film starts with a brief prologue telling us how aspiring newspaper beat writer Lucien Carr's relationships with the others. Their lives are disturbed when one of their friends is killed by Carr and Burroughs leaves New York for Mexico, with Joan. A few years later, Carr and Ginsberg visit Mexico City, where they find out Bill left his Joan and their kids in Guatemala with a gay lover who not so secretly loathes Bill, but pleases him for the money. Carr claims to love Joan, and offers to take her away from all this- or things to that effect. So, he, she, and Ginsberg hightail it, by car, to a volcano destroyed village. Yet, Joan stupidly decides to stay with Bill, who is angry over his gay lover's treatment of him. It's been a while since I saw the film, and I do not care to rewatch it to give its ending away. So, let me just cover my tail by saying you won't be blown away by the ending. Oh wait, it ends with Joan getting shot, and Carr, back in his New York office, weeping.Oddly, I was weeping, too, at the end of this film, but not for the death of Joan Vollmer, but for the death of the time it took me to watch this crap, as well the commentary which, likewise, left no real impression with me. There are precious few extras, and even were the DVD chock with them they would probably blow, as does almost everything put out by anyone even remotely connected to the Beatniks. That is because they were by and large void of talent and creativity, anomic, childish, immature, irresponsible, and plain old repugnant people who lacked ideas, compassion, sympathy, empathy, and warmth. Did I leave anything out? Oh, yeah, and the acting sucks too. Love should stick to vamping off her dead husband's legacy, Livingston apparently had no clue as to Ginsberg's speech patterns and mannerisms, and the worst of all was Kiefer Sutherland, whose revulsion in a scene where he has to kiss and get `physical' with another guy is something that has to be seen to be believed. It's that bad. Perhaps the only two good things I can say for the film and the DVD is that the film a) ends and b) shows just how dull, and all the other qualities I described above, these people were. I was actually glad when Bill killed Joan. I wanted to do it myself.In short, don't waste your time nor money.",2,Ridiculous,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,3148,"['Ask', 'yourself-', 'were', 'film', 'bunch', 'talent', 'losers', 'who', 'do', 'stupid', 'thing', 'humor', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'say', 'no', 'good', 'sum', 'what', 'film', 'beat', 'about', 'losers', 'are', 'Beatnik', 'charlatans', 'William', 'Burroughs', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Vollmer', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'pals', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'Ok', 'Ginsberg', 'least', 'had', 'talent', 'anyone', 'brain', 'pissed', 'away', 'really', 'bad', 'film', 'poverty', 'aimless', 'direction', 'Gary', 'Walkow', 'script', 'utterly', 'devoid', 'energy', 'spark', 'wit.The', 'film', 'basically', 'idiotic', 'relationship', 'bisexual', 'Bill', 'juiced', 'up', 'Joan', 'how', 'kill', 'drunken', 'game', 'William', 'Tell', 'loaded', 'gun', 'Mexico', 'City', '1950s', 'film', 'brief', 'prologue', 'telling', 'how', 'aspiring', 'newspaper', 'beat', 'writer', 'Lucien', 'Carr', 'relationships', 'others', 'lives', 'are', 'disturbed', 'when', 'one', 'friends', 'killed', 'Carr', 'Burroughs', 'New', 'York', 'Mexico', 'Joan', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Carr', 'Ginsberg', 'visit', 'Mexico', 'City', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'Bill', 'left', 'Joan', 'kids', 'Guatemala', 'gay', 'lover', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'secretly', 'Bill', 'money', 'Carr', 'love', 'Joan', 'take', 'away', 'this-', 'things', 'effect', 'So', 'Ginsberg', 'hightail', 'car', 'volcano', 'destroyed', 'village', 'Joan', 'stupidly', 'stay', 'Bill', 'who', 'angry', 'gay', 'lover', 'treatment', 'been', 'while', 'saw', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'rewatch', 'give', 'ending', 'away', 'So', 'let', 'just', 'cover', 'tail', 'saying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'ending', 'Oh', 'wait', 'Joan', 'getting', 'shot', 'Carr', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'office', 'weeping.Oddly', 'was', 'weeping', 'too', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'death', 'Joan', 'Vollmer', 'death', 'time', 'took', 'watch', 'crap', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'likewise', 'left', 'real', 'impression', 'are', 'precious', 'few', 'extras', 'even', 'were', 'DVD', 'chock', 'would', 'probably', 'blow', 'almost', 'everything', 'put', 'out', 'anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'connected', 'Beatniks', 'were', 'large', 'void', 'talent', 'creativity', 'anomic', 'childish', 'immature', 'irresponsible', 'plain', 'old', 'repugnant', 'people', 'who', 'lacked', 'ideas', 'compassion', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'warmth', 'Did', 'leave', 'anything', 'out', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'acting', 'too', 'Love', 'should', 'stick', 'vamping', 'off', 'dead', 'husband', 'legacy', 'Livingston', 'apparently', 'had', 'clue', 'Ginsberg', 'speech', 'patterns', 'mannerisms', 'worst', 'was', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'revulsion', 'scene', 'where', 'kiss', 'get', 'physical', 'guy', 'something', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'bad', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'two', 'good', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'DVD', 'film', 'b', 'just', 'how', 'dull', 'other', 'qualities', 'described', 'people', 'were', 'was', 'actually', 'glad', 'when', 'Bill', 'killed', 'Joan', 'wanted', 'do', 'myself.In', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money']",N/A

In this case, literally.A brilliant, at times magnificent, script, with the ever controversial, awesomely gifted Courtney Love, as footloose and fancy free in her part as, let's say Diane Keaton was as Annie Hall, and as cast to type.  Keifer Sutherland does capture the cadence of Burroughs' voice, but more importantly, his darkness.A child of the sixties, I grew up honoring the beats, and kept a place in my heart for them. At 14, Brando's famed saw from The Wild One, ""You don't go anywhere, man, you just go"" became my credo.  A couple of years hence, an obese, aging Alan Ginsburg would give me a long, passionate, horny look over, late one night in a New York restaurant, dispelling what I had begun to discover, in my callow and ignorant way, were some rather vague and hastily established illusions, propping up the  fragile domain of self-deceits in which I lingered too long.The beats were great - and their greatest impulse, perhaps, the turn to Zen, although the jury's still out on that one too - but there was darkness there, and many kids, such as myself, fixated on that darkness, and were devoured by it.  Homosexuality and heroin are not Gods - but that they became for the beats, and their camp followers in the Warhol wing of a generation, and generations to follow. This movie exposes that darkness at its source, eloquently, precisely, and in homage to Burroughs in the skein of his dark, unyeilding, ultimately selfish, genius, without stint.",4,"""Behind every great man, there's a. . .",1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,1598,"['bitch', 'hell', 'yappin', 'heels', 'who', 'chances', 'are', 'started', 'out', 'reasonably', 'nice', 'girl', 'messed', 'up', 'good', 'case', 'literally.A', 'brilliant', 'times', 'magnificent', 'script', 'ever', 'controversial', 'awesomely', 'gifted', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'footloose', 'fancy', 'free', 'part', 'let', 'say', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'was', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'cast', 'type', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'capture', 'cadence', 'Burroughs', 'voice', 'more', 'importantly', 'darkness.A', 'child', 'sixties', 'grew', 'up', 'honoring', 'beats', 'kept', 'place', 'heart', '14', 'Brando', 'famed', 'saw', 'Wild', 'One', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'man', 'just', 'go', 'became', 'credo', 'couple', 'years', 'hence', 'obese', 'aging', 'Alan', 'Ginsburg', 'would', 'give', 'long', 'passionate', 'horny', 'look', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'New', 'York', 'restaurant', 'dispelling', 'what', 'had', 'begun', 'discover', 'callow', 'ignorant', 'way', 'were', 'rather', 'vague', 'hastily', 'established', 'illusions', 'propping', 'up', 'fragile', 'domain', 'self-deceits', 'lingered', 'too', 'long.The', 'beats', 'were', 'great', 'greatest', 'impulse', 'perhaps', 'turn', 'Zen', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'one', 'too', 'was', 'darkness', 'there', 'many', 'kids', 'such', 'fixated', 'darkness', 'were', 'devoured', 'Homosexuality', 'heroin', 'are', 'not', 'Gods', 'became', 'beats', 'camp', 'followers', 'Warhol', 'wing', 'generation', 'generations', 'follow', 'movie', 'darkness', 'source', 'eloquently', 'precisely', 'homage', 'Burroughs', 'skein', 'dark', 'unyeilding', 'ultimately', 'selfish', 'genius', 'stint']",N/A
716025,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B00006HAXZ,Douglas King,"[0, 0]","Although this is not a great film, ""Beat"" is better and more engaging than I thought it would be. I've never been a fan of William S. Burroughs (I read Naked Lunch and hated it), but this film is really about his wife, Joan (Courtney Love), who I knew nothing about before seeing this film, other than that she was killed in the bizarre stunt portrayed at the beginning and end of the film. ""Beat"" depicts Joan as the center of a small group of artistic, self-destructive friends who include famous writers Allan Ginsberg and William Burroughs (who Joan marries and has two children with, despite his open homosexuality). Before her death, Joan serves as long-suffering wife, friend, and unrequited love object for the three men who make up the dysfunctional little clique.What's interesting about Courtney Love is that a woman who has such an over-the-top, larger-than-life persona can actually appear very subtle as a film actress. In the late 90's, after her (deservedly) praised performance in ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"", Courtney Love actually had a shot at a successful film acting career. ""Beat"" is the first time I think I've ever seen her playing a true romantic lead, and I was surprised by how well she does here. Courtney Love is not a conventional beauty, but with her wide, expressive mouth, husky voice, and air of mystery, she is believable playing a woman who served as a muse and object of desire for a small group of creative friends, two of which ended up famous for their contributions to the ""beat"" generation of writers.If Courtney had been able to maintain her sobriety and sanity, she could have emerged as a great character actress.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 4]","I will openly admit that I don't know a lot about the Beat poets -- romantic or classical poets are more my type.So I don't know EVERYTHING that is wrong with ""Beat,"" a movie that chronicles the dramatic crumble of William Burroughs' marriage to Joan Vollmer. But I do know what the movie's problems are -- the acting is patchy, the story meanders, and it's hard to care about the dying marriage of two people who don't even share the screen for most of the movie.Two years ago, William Burroughs (Kiefer Sutherland) and his common-law wife Joan Vollmer (Courtney Love) helped Lucien Carr (Norman Reedus)  after Carr killed a hanger-on who had sexually assaulted him. Now Carr is back, and he's apparently in love with Joan but not sure if he wants to also bring along her kids.So while Burroughs goes on a vacation with a boyfriend, Joan impulsively goes off with Carr and Allen Ginsberg (Ron Livingston), and begins to seriously consider leaving her husband. Of course, it inevitably leads to tragedy... and since they show it in the very first scene, I'll just say that it involves a ""William Tell act.""Anyone hoping for a cinematic dash of beat flavor is going to cry after they see this movie -- the beat movement and their work is barely touched on. It's like the producers heard, ""Real life accidental death/possible murder by famous figure!"" and decided to make a movie about it without knowing much about any of the people involved.In fact, most of the movie is a slow, rather dreary trip through the Mexican forests, where people talk and occasionally kiss; and we have some brief glimpses of Burroughs trying to cuddle his boyfriend in a dingy bedroom, as well as sepia-toned flashbacks.  The narrative just sort of oozes along, with a few quotables that clunk off the ear (""But people decay more promptly than Mayan temples"").In short, it's... pretty, but very boring. As for the dramatic and infamous death scene, there doesn't seem to be any ambiguity about whether it was deliberate or not.Sutherland gives aperfect impression of Ginsberg's voice, but he spends most of the movie looking like he's confused by his ill-defined character. But he does do a good job near the end, such as when we see Ginsberg tearing up while having a knife resharpened. Courtney Love looks like she's stoned most of the time, slurring and drowsily twisting her large lips, while Reedus and Livingston are excellent but mostly wasted.""Beat"" is allegedly about the beat poets and the death of Joan Vollmer, but don't be fooled.

716027,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B00006HAXZ,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[0, 0]","""Beat"" is set in an interlude in the lives of beat writer William S. Burroughs (Kiefer Sutherland) and his wife Joan Vollmer (Courtney Love). While Burroughs is on a vacation to Guatemala to romance a boyfriend, Vollmer is visited by New York friends Allen Ginsberg (Ron Livingston) and Lucien Carr (Norman Reedus). While Burroughs is away pursuing his affair Carr tries to seduce Vollmer into one of their own. Weighing on everyone is Carr's recent release from prison for the killing of David Kemmerer (Kyle Secor) who was obsessively in love with Carr.I was going to write that the cast wasn't given much to do but late in the film Sutherland wrings some emotion out of Burroughs who was a stoic, taciturn person, but Sutherland brings some real heartfelt emotion to Burroughs. Sutherland is a much finer actor with a greater range than his ""24"" character Jack Bauer would betray and it is somewhat a pity that Sutherland isn't picking more diverse roles such as ""Beat."" It would really demonstrate his range as an actor.The one real problem is that Kiefer Sutherland and Courtney Love look to healthy to be Joan and William Burroughs. As mentioned in the film Burroughs moved to Mexico to have an unfettered supply of drugs where he could just go down to the drugstore and get some morphine, Sutherland doesn't look like a person mainlining morphine. Joan prior to moving to Mexico was so strung out on Benzedrine that in the middle of the night she was scrapping lizards off the trees in their front yard, neither look lost in the drug the movie describes or that the real people were at at this point in their lives.I'm a fan of beat writers and the lives they lead and some artistic liscense is taken, but I did enjoy the movie and it does lead to some insight and fleshes out characters into people one only has read about as history.

716030,A1977ZR4KQYZ4J,B00006HAXZ,mrgrieves08,"[1, 2]","I rented this film with high hopes as I am a fan of William S. Burroughs and to a lesser extent Allen Ginsberg. Unfortunately, however, it didn't take long for this film to disappoint me. Coming in at 80 minutes I felt that the plot (the time period building up to WS Burroughs' ""accidental"" shooting of his wife Joan Vollmer) never got a chance to develop and thus the characters were nearly impossible to identify with, much less have sympathy for. At the end I was just happy that it was over and couldn't help but laugh at Jane's supposedly haunting Conradesque last words. The score was also very annoying as it droned on in heroic intonations-reminiscent of the beautiful and fitting music in the Shawshank Redemption-only in this film there is no redemption, tragedy or depth at all. Perhaps, it could have been better if the director would have had more time to develop the plot and the characters-it seems that he expects that the viewer will already know all the details. Keifer Sutherland does a nice job capturing Burroughs' voice and mannerism, but is undone by poor performance by Courtney Love, who seems to be playing herself-once again-instead of Vollmer. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, but the most dedicated Burroughs' fan and even then just for the curiosity.",2,Can't live up to the characters,1056585600,"06 26, 2003",2003,1290,"['rented', 'film', 'high', 'hopes', 'am', 'fan', 'William', 'S.', 'Burroughs', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'film', 'disappoint', 'Coming', '80', 'minutes', 'felt', 'plot', 'time', 'period', 'building', 'up', 'WS', 'Burroughs', 'accidental', 'shooting', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Vollmer', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'develop', 'thus', 'characters', 'were', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'identify', 'much', 'less', 'have', 'sympathy', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'happy', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'Jane', 'supposedly', 'haunting', 'Conradesque', 'last', 'words', 'score', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'annoying', 'droned', 'heroic', 'intonations-reminiscent', 'beautiful', 'fitting', 'music', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption-only', 'film', 'redemption', 'tragedy', 'depth', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'plot', 'characters-it', 'viewer', 'will', 'already', 'know', 'details', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'nice', 'job', 'capturing', 'Burroughs', 'voice', 'mannerism', 'undone', 'poor', 'performance', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'who', 'be', 'playing', 'herself-once', 'again-instead', 'Vollmer', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'most', 'dedicated', 'Burroughs', 'fan', 'even', 'then', 'just', 'curiosity']",N/A
