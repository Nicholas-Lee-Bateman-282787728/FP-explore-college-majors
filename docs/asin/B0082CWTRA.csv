It's surprisingly awful in how mindblowingly bad it is.Well if this was Kevin Smith's Smodcast's first film to come out on the label, he should just pack it up now as this movie was 50 shades of awful. It felt like a rejected very long ""Whitest Kids You Know"" sketch, minus the humor, wit, and good acting of that aforementioned show of course.

The script has moments but is often pointlessly crude just for shock value, the acting is weak all around, and the plot goes all over the place for no special reason.The camera is moved well and there's hints of quality to come from the writer/director/star in some scenes, but he ain't there yet and this got boring far too fast for a film just trying to be fun. Too serious to be fun at points and too stupid to be serious when it wants to be, Bindlestiff just feels like a film school project that somehow got released on dvd when it should be on youtube.Kevin Smith owes us a couple bucks. He might think crude and lewd is enough to make a flick work, but it ain't.
