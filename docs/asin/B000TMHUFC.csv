The picture and the DTS HD sound is amazing. They also have DOLBY TRUHD on here.I own a lot of Hindi movies that I've copied onto my DVD-R discs and I've been happy with the picture and sound quality. For the first time, I witnessed what a blu-ray disc can do to a movie. I was speechless. The picture quality is 10 times sharper than my compressed video and the sound quality is 10 times sharper than my compressed audio on my DVD-RSo I've donated my copy of this movie in DVD-R and I'm keeping this blu ray disc. It is of course region free and will play easily on any blu ray player in the world. Please be warned that this will not play in a DVD player. This blu-ray disc requires a blu-ray player.Highly recommended!!",5,Fantastic Movie.

1091635,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B000TMHUFC,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[0, 0]","This is not your typical Bollywood romance--and that's both good and bad. Good because it's a realistic portrayal of a flawed man and woman working to overcome their differences. Bad because the love story is too mundane. Buddhadev Gupta (played by Amitabh Bachchan) is a grouchy 64-year-old chef in London who falls for Nina (Tabu), a 34-year-old tourist from Delhi. The immensely talented lead actors give respectable performances as their very ordinary characters grapple with the predictable challenges of a May-December romance. But it is the supporting actors who really make the movie worth watching. Paresh Rawal, one of India's best comedic actors, brings much-needed levity to the film as Nina's father, who is six years younger than her suitor and who opposes the match. Zohra Sehgal, a spry 97-year-old actress who plays Buddhadev's mother, is delightful as always. And adorable child actress Swini Khera melts hearts as Buddhadev's cancer-stricken neighbor who is wise beyond her years. If it weren't for these entertaining secondary characters, the movie would be too boring to sit through. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",3,Worth Watching,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,1197,"['not', 'typical', 'Bollywood', 'romance', 'good', 'bad', 'Good', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'flawed', 'man', 'woman', 'working', 'overcome', 'differences', 'Bad', 'love', 'story', 'too', 'mundane', 'Buddhadev', 'Gupta', 'played', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'grouchy', '64-year-old', 'chef', 'London', 'who', 'Nina', 'Tabu', '34-year-old', 'tourist', 'Delhi', 'immensely', 'talented', 'lead', 'actors', 'give', 'respectable', 'performances', 'very', 'ordinary', 'characters', 'grapple', 'predictable', 'challenges', 'May-December', 'romance', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'watching', 'Paresh', 'Rawal', 'one', 'India', 'best', 'comedic', 'actors', 'much-needed', 'levity', 'film', 'Nina', 'father', 'who', 'six', 'years', 'younger', 'suitor', 'who', 'match', 'Zohra', 'Sehgal', 'spry', '97-year-old', 'actress', 'who', 'Buddhadev', 'mother', 'delightful', 'always', 'adorable', 'child', 'actress', 'Swini', 'Khera', 'melts', 'hearts', 'Buddhadev', 'cancer-stricken', 'neighbor', 'who', 'wise', 'years', 'were', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'secondary', 'characters', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'boring', 'sit', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",N/A

1091639,A6M5U2YWC3YFF,B000TMHUFC,Timothy Liebe,"[1, 1]","I'll admit, I'm a sucker for *masala* conventions - overstuffed emotions, whiplash plot swings from comedy to romance to tragedy, and elaborate song and dance numbers at the drop of a hat...especially that last. CHEENI KUM doesn't have any elaborate song and dance numbers, the emotions are recognizably human-sized, and even the plot swings feel logically presented in the story rather than tossed in as desperate &#34;POP!&#34;s to get the audience excited. Having said that, this is one of my favorite recent Indian movies - right up there with EKLAYVA: THE ROYAL GUARD, AAJA NACHLE, RANG DE BASANTI, OM SHANTI OM, BHOOTHNATH and KRRISH.If you watch any Indian movies, you already know Amitabh Bachchan is a wonderfully engaging ham bursting with star quality - CHEENI KUM shows just how great he can be playing a (mostly) human-sized character, a middle-aged but still single Indian man in London with a cranky mother still living with him. (Let's make allowances - he is the Executive Chef/Owner of a top Indian restaurant, after all, so he gets to roar a lot in the early going.) He meets disagreeably but is intrigued by a single Indian woman in her Thirties (Tabu) who won't be pushed around by his arrogance or bellicosity, and who shows him up on the proper cooking of a dish (one of his line cooks mistakenly added sugar instead of salt, which he would have known if he'd bothered to taste it when she first complained to him!). While never exactly admitting he was wrong, he tries to make it up to her - and thus begins a slow slide into the two of them falling for each other, punctuated with lots of increasingly affectionate insults and scoldings. When he finally asks her to marry him, the two of them, with his mother in tow, head off to Delhi to get her Father's permission - her pompous, cricket-mad, non-vegetarian Father who's six years younger than his perspective son-in-law!Bachchan and Tabu give beautifully modulated performances, and are completely believable as two older people who become a couple. Even the broadly comic (her father, supposedly a follower of Gandhi, stages a petulant hunger strike so his daughter won't marry a man older than he is) or &#34;filmi&#34; elements (the lovable cancer-stricken pre-teen daughter of his neighbor dies near the climax, resulting in Bachchan having a Bollywood-style mad with grief scene!) are offset by the human-sized situations and performances.CHEENI KUM is a Bollywood movie I think just about anybody, Western film fan as well as Indian one, would enjoy. If only it had a couple song and dance numbers, it would have been a five-star movie for me....",4,"Surprisingly Non-Melodramatic, Non-Musical Bollywood Romantic Comedy",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,2630,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'sucker', '*masala*', 'conventions', 'overstuffed', 'emotions', 'whiplash', 'plot', 'swings', 'comedy', 'romance', 'tragedy', 'elaborate', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'drop', 'hat', 'especially', 'last', 'CHEENI', 'KUM', ""n't"", 'have', 'elaborate', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'emotions', 'are', 'recognizably', 'human-sized', 'even', 'plot', 'swings', 'feel', 'logically', 'presented', 'story', 'rather', 'tossed', 'desperate', '34', 'POP', '34', 's', 'get', 'audience', 'excited', 'Having', 'said', 'one', 'favorite', 'recent', 'Indian', 'movies', 'right', 'there', 'EKLAYVA', 'ROYAL', 'GUARD', 'AAJA', 'NACHLE', 'RANG', 'DE', 'BASANTI', 'OM', 'SHANTI', 'OM', 'BHOOTHNATH', 'KRRISH.If', 'watch', 'Indian', 'movies', 'already', 'know', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'wonderfully', 'engaging', 'ham', 'bursting', 'star', 'quality', 'CHEENI', 'KUM', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'can', 'be', 'playing', 'mostly', 'human-sized', 'character', 'middle-aged', 'still', 'single', 'Indian', 'man', 'London', 'cranky', 'mother', 'still', 'living', 'Let', 'make', 'allowances', 'Executive', 'Chef/Owner', 'top', 'Indian', 'restaurant', 'roar', 'lot', 'early', 'going', 'disagreeably', 'intrigued', 'single', 'Indian', 'woman', 'Thirties', 'Tabu', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'pushed', 'arrogance', 'bellicosity', 'who', 'up', 'proper', 'cooking', 'dish', 'one', 'line', 'mistakenly', 'added', 'sugar', 'instead', 'salt', 'would', 'have', 'known', ""'d"", 'bothered', 'taste', 'when', 'first', 'complained', 'never', 'exactly', 'admitting', 'was', 'wrong', 'make', 'up', 'thus', 'slow', 'slide', 'two', 'falling', 'other', 'punctuated', 'lots', 'increasingly', 'affectionate', 'insults', 'scoldings', 'When', 'finally', 'marry', 'two', 'mother', 'tow', 'head', 'Delhi', 'get', 'Father', 'permission', 'pompous', 'cricket-mad', 'non-vegetarian', 'Father', 'who', 'six', 'years', 'younger', 'perspective', 'son-in-law', 'Bachchan', 'Tabu', 'give', 'beautifully', 'modulated', 'performances', 'are', 'completely', 'believable', 'two', 'older', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'couple', 'Even', 'broadly', 'comic', 'father', 'supposedly', 'follower', 'Gandhi', 'petulant', 'hunger', 'strike', 'daughter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'marry', 'man', 'older', '34', 'filmi', '34', 'elements', 'lovable', 'cancer-stricken', 'pre-teen', 'daughter', 'neighbor', 'dies', 'climax', 'resulting', 'Bachchan', 'having', 'Bollywood-style', 'mad', 'grief', 'scene', 'are', 'offset', 'human-sized', 'situations', 'performances.CHEENI', 'KUM', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'think', 'just', 'anybody', 'Western', 'film', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'Indian', 'one', 'would', 'enjoy', 'only', 'had', 'couple', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'five-star', 'movie']",N/A
