717323,A1TPXS3X3QJIEO,B00006IUJM,"Arthur Gardner ""Aardcore""","[1, 1]","I bought Gen-X cops back some years ago when I was walking around some video store here in small town america cities called Hastings and came across this movie called Gen-X cops... it had Jackie Chan in it, but it mislead me to believe it HAD Jackie Chan starring in it solely as the main character... I was wrong and instead there were these 4 other hip-hop kungfu kids running around... and the movie actually wasn't that bad. I enjoyed it, had some awesome fight scenes, a good enough story and it seemed to just... charm me somehow. I found out a sequel to Gen-X cops was out and I figured I'd dig into it.Big mistake. Gen-Y cops is everything Gen-X cops SHOULDN'T BE and I have no idea why it was made in the first place... I'm not sure if it's a sequel to begin with but the movie is terrible. There's no subtitled version to be found and the voice acting in this is HORRENDOUS! I couldn't finish past the first 15 minutes of it, turned off my DVD and wanted to cry for having bought a martial arts movie that is so bad I actually let it sit in my library of movies... it's a pure black sheep.I give it 2 stars only for the sake that this is an exploit of Jackie Chan's... since supposedly he's in here too... I think... I  really don't know since I couldn't watch past the first 15 minutes of it (the voice acting... GOD THE VOICE ACTING!). Take my word for it, rent this movie but NEVER buy it. If you do rent it, you'd seriously have nothing else better to do or must have a real ironskin for this kind of thing because the movie is really not that good at all.",2,What the hell happened?!,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,1570,"['bought', 'Gen-X', 'cops', 'back', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'walking', 'around', 'video', 'store', 'here', 'small', 'town', 'america', 'cities', 'called', 'Hastings', 'came', 'movie', 'called', 'Gen-X', 'cops', 'had', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'mislead', 'believe', 'HAD', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'starring', 'solely', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'wrong', 'instead', 'were', '4', 'other', 'hip-hop', 'kungfu', 'kids', 'running', 'around', 'movie', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'awesome', 'fight', 'scenes', 'good', 'enough', 'story', 'seemed', 'just', 'charm', 'somehow', 'found', 'out', 'sequel', 'Gen-X', 'cops', 'was', 'figured', ""'d"", 'dig', 'it.Big', 'mistake', 'Gen-Y', 'cops', 'everything', 'Gen-X', 'cops', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'BE', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'was', 'made', 'first', 'place', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'sequel', 'begin', 'movie', 'terrible', 'subtitled', 'version', 'be', 'found', 'voice', 'acting', 'HORRENDOUS', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'turned', 'off', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'cry', 'having', 'bought', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'let', 'sit', 'library', 'movies', 'pure', 'black', 'sheep.I', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'only', 'sake', 'exploit', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'supposedly', 'here', 'too', 'think', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'voice', 'acting', 'GOD', 'THE', 'VOICE', 'ACTING', 'Take', 'word', 'rent', 'movie', 'NEVER', 'buy', 'do', 'rent', ""'d"", 'seriously', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'better', 'do', 'must', 'have', 'real', 'ironskin', 'kind', 'thing', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'good']",Jackie Chan Presents Gen-Y Cops

The acting is ok, but the whole movie has a fun atmosphere and makes up for a weak story with nice action and visuals.

717327,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00006IUJM,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 4]","When I had to go to the bathroom & push pause, my wife told me upon my return that we would not continue with this rubbish.  After we watched the DVD she selected, I encouraged her to go check her email because I wanted to see what happened.  As maybe my home experience may indicate, this is not a qualitatively good film.  However, you can have fun with it.  It's the kind of movie teenagers would love to rent to make fun of at the party.  Almost orphaned, a blond Paul Rudd plays Ian Curtis, an F.B.I. agent in search of a sense of humor.  We'd just seen him in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and laughed with him in ""Anchorman.""  Seeing him here was unexpected.  Fortunately, most American viewers will probably miss this epic.  When something aims to be silly, you have to ask if you enjoyed it.  I'm not sure of the young actor's name with the funny-shaped head (Stephen Fung?), but he mugs mercilessly for the camera and is humorous kind of like Chris Rock.  Richard Sun plays the villain Kurt who apparently is bright enough to invent the super robot.  However, none of that intelligence is seen on screen.  He mugs fiendishly.  Edison Chen as Edison is the red-haired Japanese cop who was friends with Kurt.  After playing paint ball with colorful blue explosions, Kurt injects Edison who then becomes hypnotized and can run a supercomputer to reprogram the robot.  We wonder what kind of drug can convey such amazing formulas, but it's a wild action packed shoot 'em up.  The film climaxes better than it begins with a great shooting match in the mall.  If you want a movie that makes sense or takes itself seriously, you have to go elsewhere.  But if you want to see something utterly silly that has plenty of explosions, you may be able to watch to the very end of ""Gen-Y Cops.""

717329,APIW11UEPKIC2,B00006IUJM,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[1, 1]","Gen-Y Cops doesn't seem to be made for children, but the dialogue and voice acting are very childish.  A bunch of 20 year old looking cops are after a hacker who used to work for the government.  There isn't even any interaction between the hacker and his former superior.  One of the cops is the hacker's old friend and gets forced to work for him.  The cop gets framed for murdering an F.B.I. agent and now has to prove that he was forced to kill the traitor agent.  There is also a robot that the hacker wants to steal.  The story doesn't even deserve to be explained.I like the actor who plays the hacker, and 2 of the cops are good actors, but the plot doesn't allow them to do anything noteworthy.  Everything about the story was done with about 50% effort.  I was very happy when it finally ended.  I would have enjoyed it more if Christy Chung and Maggie Q had more screen time.  Maggie Q is very good in her limited role, but the standout actor to me was the African-American guy who plays Paul Rudd's partner.  He ends up playing a key role in the movie which I was happy to see.The action is decent, but there is nothing interesting about it.  There is too much editing, the wirework is bad, and it is shot too close up in most scenes.  There aren't any good fist fights.  It is all just flips and unrealistic wire assisted kicks.  And Christy Chung should have been allowed to unleash at least a couple kicks.I am a fan of Bey Logan because he always gives such informative commentaries on the Hong Kong Legends and Dragon Dynasty DVDs, but he should not be writing movie scripts.  I have seen about 5 or 6 movies where Logan is listed as a writer, and they all have some of the worst dialogue imaginable.1.5/5The picture and sound quality on the Universal DVD is a disappointment.  It is full screen which cuts out a lot of the action, and the picture quality is a bit blurry.

717330,A34X0JH8GU1TCL,B00006IUJM,"orbit13 ""orbit13""","[5, 5]","There's a lot you can do in an hour and a half - walk your dog, eat a good meal, play a board game - but watching ""Gen Y Cops"" is most definitely NOT a way to pass your time.  Success (of the first ""Gen X Cops"") more often than not spawns bad sequels and this one hits the bottom with a thud.  Fans of the first installment should consider that ""Gen X"" is to its sequel what the original ""Godfather"" is to ""Godfather III,"" times ten.  This time around, things go wrong for our cool cops when a super-robot is stolen and reprogrammed for evil purposes by a maniacal Rufio wannabe (Richard Sun).  Things go haywire as American and Hong Kong forces team up to reclaim and destroy this robot thing before it can take over the world, and before hero Edison can be brainwashed by the bad guys into joining the Dark Side.  Enter a lot of guns, a lot dark sets that are supposed to look sleek, and a LOT of bad acting.Blame goes to all involved in this project but falls heaviest on the writers who missed the memo on what made ""Gen X"" such a popular success.  The first film remained lighthearted yet styled with occasionally innovative and mostly well-executed action sequences.  It wasn't overly ambitious but just edgy enough to get the adrenaline flowing. ""Gen Y,"" however, loses the humor and the naivite of rookie officers pushing their way through bureaucratic misdeeds in the pursuit of justice. Clearly, everyone figured good looks and frigid model stares would propel ""Gen Y"" through its script and directing pitfalls.  Sorry, folks.  The result is a pedestrian plot and dialogue that don't deserve the barreling, and plain bad, effort the cast puts forth.  Match (Stephen Fung) and Alien (Sam Lee) are the only characters worth half of our emotional investment and even they are reduced to tools for their English-speaking cohorts.  If this is intended as some statement about Western domination, it fails.  Perhaps the most nagging question for fans of the original - what happened to Nic Tse and Grace Yip's characters, both of who disappear completely from the script?So never mind the story is cartoonish and the effects Power Ranger-esque.  Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk couldn't save this dud, but that?s no excuse to invite some of the worst young actors to have a go.  Maggie Q, best known as a model and Daniel Wu's (of ""Gen X"" fame) ex, seems to think she's still on the catwalk; my dead dog is more expressive than her.  Richard Sun and prettyboy sensation Edison Chen apparently dropped out of ghetto fab school, exhibiting some of the worst street English ever.  One prays that fans in Asia have not opted for this film to review their English lessons.  And Paul Rudd, poor, poor Paul Rudd.  I like this guy enough that I wish I could have told him to stay in America.  Any fans he had will be lost after they catch a glimpse of this mess.  As for the rest of the cast, a host of Hong Kong stars make an appearance that is summarily wasted, kind of like this entire movie.",1,Save your brain cells; watch another movie,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,3005,"['lot', 'can', 'do', 'hour', 'half', 'walk', 'dog', 'eat', 'good', 'meal', 'play', 'board', 'game', 'watching', 'Gen', 'Y', 'Cops', 'most', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'Success', 'first', 'Gen', 'X', 'Cops', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'spawns', 'bad', 'sequels', 'one', 'bottom', 'thud', 'Fans', 'first', 'installment', 'should', 'consider', 'Gen', 'X', 'sequel', 'what', 'original', 'Godfather', 'Godfather', 'III', 'times', 'ten', 'time', 'around', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'cool', 'cops', 'when', 'super-robot', 'stolen', 'reprogrammed', 'evil', 'purposes', 'maniacal', 'Rufio', 'wannabe', 'Richard', 'Sun', 'Things', 'go', 'haywire', 'American', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'forces', 'team', 'up', 'reclaim', 'destroy', 'robot', 'thing', 'can', 'take', 'world', 'hero', 'Edison', 'can', 'be', 'brainwashed', 'bad', 'guys', 'joining', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Enter', 'lot', 'guns', 'lot', 'dark', 'sets', 'are', 'supposed', 'look', 'sleek', 'LOT', 'bad', 'acting.Blame', 'involved', 'project', 'heaviest', 'writers', 'who', 'missed', 'memo', 'what', 'made', 'Gen', 'X', 'such', 'popular', 'success', 'first', 'film', 'remained', 'lighthearted', 'yet', 'styled', 'occasionally', 'innovative', 'mostly', 'well-executed', 'action', 'sequences', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'ambitious', 'just', 'edgy', 'enough', 'get', 'adrenaline', 'flowing', 'Gen', 'Y', 'however', 'humor', 'naivite', 'rookie', 'officers', 'pushing', 'way', 'bureaucratic', 'misdeeds', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'Clearly', 'everyone', 'figured', 'good', 'looks', 'frigid', 'model', 'stares', 'would', 'propel', 'Gen', 'Y', 'script', 'directing', 'pitfalls', 'Sorry', 'folks', 'result', 'pedestrian', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'barreling', 'plain', 'bad', 'effort', 'cast', 'forth', 'Match', 'Stephen', 'Fung', 'Alien', 'Sam', 'Lee', 'are', 'only', 'characters', 'worth', 'half', 'emotional', 'investment', 'even', 'are', 'reduced', 'tools', 'English-speaking', 'cohorts', 'intended', 'statement', 'Western', 'domination', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'nagging', 'question', 'fans', 'original', 'what', 'happened', 'Nic', 'Tse', 'Grace', 'Yip', 'characters', 'who', 'disappear', 'completely', 'script', 'So', 'never', 'mind', 'story', 'cartoonish', 'effects', 'Power', 'Ranger-esque', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chiu-Wai', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'Man-Yuk', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'dud', 's', 'excuse', 'invite', 'worst', 'young', 'actors', 'have', 'go', 'Maggie', 'Q', 'best', 'known', 'model', 'Daniel', 'Wu', 'Gen', 'X', 'fame', 'ex', 'think', 'still', 'catwalk', 'dead', 'dog', 'more', 'expressive', 'Richard', 'Sun', 'prettyboy', 'sensation', 'Edison', 'Chen', 'apparently', 'dropped', 'ghetto', 'fab', 'school', 'exhibiting', 'worst', 'street', 'English', 'ever', 'One', 'fans', 'Asia', 'have', 'not', 'opted', 'film', 'review', 'English', 'lessons', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'poor', 'poor', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'guy', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'stay', 'America', 'fans', 'had', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'mess', 'rest', 'cast', 'host', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'stars', 'make', 'appearance', 'summarily', 'wasted', 'kind', 'entire', 'movie']",Jackie Chan Presents Gen-Y Cops
