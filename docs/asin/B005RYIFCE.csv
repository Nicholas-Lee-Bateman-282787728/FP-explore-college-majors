Everybody who asks themselves whether the movie real or not, it is not, but it is based on some real events(and I really doubt it has anything to do with the monster in the deep of the underground). Visit their website at [...] and read more about this good scary movie. The story is 5/5(You won't believe how entertaining it was), creepiness is 5/5(It is really creepy in some places. Made me stop the movie a few times to continue to watch it), gore 2/5 (It was really unnecessary to have a lot of gore in the movie to make it look good). Actors in the movie played so really good, I was trying to catch them on bad acting and I didn't. As for the creature, if you really think it is real, think again. How can it move with such a speed in real life (you will see it incredibly well in one cut scene. No spoilers)? In other scenes it moved not with such a high speed as it was before in the beginning. Makes me wonder why would it suddenly move a lot slower compare to it's original speed. In the very end a paramedic was standing far from a dying person. How long was he standing there? Why didn't he run to help the person? A movie mistake? Maybe, maybe not. And finally when that already dead man was lying on the floor I didn't really notice who moved his leg. Maybe it was a movie mistake.Verdict: Get the movie, you won't regret it. You can't go wrong with it.",5,A must have.

You don't know what talking heads are? It's a cheap production technique where all you see is someone's head talking to the camera; often in a monotonic pseudo-documentary style to save money and cover a lack of the following: acting, sets, props, plot and to lend a deceiving sense of credibility to a story. Large percentage of the film is fake security camera scenes of people talking or walking. No English subtitles to make up for poor audio quality, enunciation and for those viewer's with hearing issues.(2.) The Blair copycat formula of poorly lit places with shaky cameras e.g. Quarantine, [Rec], Poughkeepsie Tapes, Wicksboro Incident.(3.) Storyline is of the usual investigators of a make believe or highly exaggerated haunted ""whatever"" story. This one's a subway.(4.) Over 40% is the isolated claustrophobic running nowhere as seen from the point of view of a camera (or two). In this case, as is usual, we have normal lighting which seems to randomly switch off followed by viewing through a low light camera. If watching the walls of a subway tunnel is exciting then this is time well spent.(5.) Scary part as always is very brief and in this case just seconds.  A very blurry figure that likes to make groaning sounds (how creative) and snatches someone so quickly it also is just a blur.(6.)

1498069,A238M34Z3X2IBD,B005RYIFCE,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[11, 17]","Going into THE TUNNEL I was well aware of what the ""monster"" was.  And not because I read the back of the box, or a review or had been recommended to it by a friend, but by simple math: TUNNEL + SCREAMING GREEN FACE = C.H.U.D. (1984).  More than a few films over the years (THE DESCENT - 2005 - come first to mind) have gone back to this well about underground dwellers and what mutations and monsters might exist there.  THE TUNNEL is no different, but, what drew to me it was the chance that maybe someone might finally expand upon the idea and deliver a well developed, unsettling take on this very real underground world that lives beneath a number of major cities around the world.I was not unaware that we would be going down this hole as a ""film"", but more a ""found footage"" take on C.H.U.D. with possibilites - well, none of those possibilites were realized and what I got (and what you will find) is an overly padded flashback with more logic gaps than the bridge to nowhere.  About half of this film is told in a Ken Burns fugue state with two of the principal cast talking either directly to the camera, or, even better, looking wistfully off in another direction with their own narration playing over their faces giving them the chance to show you Just. How. Serious. They're. Taking. It.  This flashback style robs the film of 50% of its tension, leaving the rest a chaotic mess of stops and starts and of faces in extreme close up and their sneakers - seriously, either there's a face filling the frame of its the sneakers of the cmaeraman who simply forgets what his job is supposed to be about.  The locations are not bad; but they quickly betray just how bland they are when they start to blend together.  The whole idea here is, of course, that its very easy to get lost down in the tunnels, but I think its more the fact that they didn't have very much they could shoot, so the cast ends up running around in circles and shaking the camera to give you the feeling that this is a whole new section with fresh dangers and more dead ends than you can count.That doesn't mean it doesn't hold the power to evoke a chill or two.  One room in particular raises a host of questions that never get any answers (and owes a more than knowning nod to HOSTEL), leaving your mind to fill in the blanks while the cast move on to the next thing, which looks exactly like the last thing they just left.  As for the ""monster"" the film moves quickly into [REC] (2007) territory here.  If you're familiar with the original or the polished U.S. remake (Quarrantine - 2008), then you'll know we're deep into night vision country which is haunted by the silver, white glowing eyes of some chalk white goon stalking in the dark hunting for flesh...and also, in this case, eyes.  The one true original turn here gets a quick look and pass by the filmmakers so they can get back to the flashback interviews and looking directly into people's faces and at their sneakers.  There's a moment where it seems like they stumble across a oddball underground chruch made up of roots and stolen eyes and everyone takes a moment to Seriously. Freak. Out. and then their off leaving this good idea far behind...why?  Running time is my guess.The film doesn't even have the decency in the end to pay off its premise about a government cover-up (which is the kick off for the action) and its unclear from the ""interviews"" if the footage we're seeing actually survived their ordeal; because if it did, it proves their story completely, if not, then it's another cheat by the filmmakers to dodge having to actually resolve anything (which is the norm for these types of films - it frees to filmmakers from having to write an ending; all you need is a quick CUT TO black and roll of weak text wrap up and you're done, man!).Either way, the entire experience of THE TUNNEL is worthless.  It's so similar to everything that's come before it that even before you open the box you already know everything there is to know about it.

Sure, I wish a few brief and derivative moments weren't in there (one of which was so reminiscent of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, almost word for word, that it brought the story to a complete awkward halt for me. Fortunately, it was a VERY brief halt) Also, I feel the format of the storytelling removes the suspense of who survived. Mind you, it still leaves the suspense of WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THE OTHERS? which is almost as creepy. Except for one a-bit-too-special-effects-y shot, the fleeting views of ""it"" work SO WELL, right up there with a similar method used in the films REC and REC2. However, the star of this is the editing and the location (in a way reminiscent of the equally creepy film SESSION 9. Anyway, what I loved about this movie is the ebb and flow of the suspense, the overwhelming sense of dread (love that creepy music in the opening credits). If you need all questions answered and mysteries explained by the end of a movie, this is NOT for you. If you need characters fighting back while spouting one-liners, this is NOT for you. If you need to see violence and gore being inflicted on people, this is NOT for you. (just glimpsing the aftermath, using my imagination and feeling as helpless as the rest of the characters was enough for me here) If you would like to end a movie feeling unsettled yet not necessarily cheated, then you might want to check this out. I'm a big fan of bleak (but not oppressive) movies with bleak endings.
