581455,A2OP21WUY8L3WL,B00005BJOL,Robert Meeks,"[3, 14]","Please do not confuse this movie with the much later and much better movie of the same name which stars Billy Bob Thorton. This movie was released to the theatre in 1983 as 'The Man Who Wasn't There in 3-D' which starred Steve Guttenberg (Diner; Police Academy 1,2,3,etc.). In 1983 a glut of 3-D movies were released. The boom for 3-D movies was revamped with the release of ""Comin' at Ya in 3-D"" which was released in 1981. In general, the 3-D movies released after that proceeded to kill any interest in 3-D movies. 'The Man Who Wasn't There in 3-D' beat the corpse. This movie was hastily thrown together by producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. who also produced 'Friday the 13th-Part III in 3-D'. Being released on video this movie loses any redeeming value (what little it had) in the loss of its invisible man in 3-D effects. They did actually put some effort into these effects but in the haste to put together a movie they patchworked a lame comedy/spy story with scenes that were obviously thrown in on the day of shooting. The movie was obviously made to showcase 3-D effects and take advantage of the 3-D boom with any thought of a script taking a backseat. Of interest is the fact that the production of this movie was the first time that a 3-D movie was made without a breakdown in the equipment causing delays. Perhaps if the equipment had broken down it could have given them an opportunity to work on a script. Supposedly this movie was a cross between the movies 'Foul Play' and 'North By Northwest' (uh...okay), any relationship begins and ends there. This is the story of Sam, a very minor government official who is responsible for the diplomatic relations of fourth world nations, countries so small that they are not even on the map. Sam is preparing for his wedding when an invisible man carrying a visible sphere of vials is assasinated in his presence. In the resulting chaos, Sam accidentally ingests some of the invisibility potion thus becoming invisible and also ends up with the remaining vials. This leads to attempts to track Sam and a conspiracy involving friends and enemies. I actually had to consult an article on the movie to get the basic plot because the movie itself is so confused and when I saw it in the theatre I dozed off so many times that the end credits were my favorite part. The humor, plot devices, and pace of this movie are strained and forced. The attempts at humor are not funny (and this is supposed to be a comedy), what plot exists is so disjointed as to make it difficult if not impossible to follow, and nobody in this movie gives a good performance. It was bad in the theatre (frankly one of the worst movies ever made) now imagine how much worse it would be on home video when you take out the only mildly interesting 3-D effects. This is a movie only recommendable for your worst enemy-Bob",1,The plot that wasn't there.,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,2843,"['Please', 'do', 'not', 'confuse', 'movie', 'much', 'later', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theatre', '1983', ""'The"", 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", '3-D', 'starred', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'Diner', 'Police', 'Academy', '1,2,3', 'etc.', '1983', 'glut', '3-D', 'movies', 'were', 'released', 'boom', '3-D', 'movies', 'was', 'revamped', 'release', 'Comin', 'Ya', '3-D', 'was', 'released', '1981', 'general', '3-D', 'movies', 'released', 'proceeded', 'kill', 'interest', '3-D', 'movies', ""'The"", 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", '3-D', 'beat', 'corpse', 'movie', 'was', 'hastily', 'thrown', 'together', 'producer', 'Frank', 'Mancuso', 'Jr.', 'who', 'also', 'produced', '13th-Part', 'III', '3-D', 'Being', 'released', 'video', 'movie', 'redeeming', 'value', 'what', 'had', 'loss', 'invisible', 'man', '3-D', 'effects', 'did', 'actually', 'put', 'effort', 'effects', 'haste', 'put', 'together', 'movie', 'patchworked', 'lame', 'comedy/spy', 'story', 'scenes', 'were', 'obviously', 'thrown', 'day', 'shooting', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'showcase', '3-D', 'effects', 'take', 'advantage', '3-D', 'boom', 'thought', 'script', 'taking', 'backseat', 'interest', 'fact', 'production', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'time', '3-D', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'breakdown', 'equipment', 'causing', 'delays', 'Perhaps', 'equipment', 'had', 'broken', 'down', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'opportunity', 'work', 'script', 'Supposedly', 'movie', 'was', 'cross', 'movies', 'Play', ""'North"", 'Northwest', 'uh', 'okay', 'relationship', 'there', 'story', 'Sam', 'very', 'minor', 'government', 'official', 'who', 'responsible', 'diplomatic', 'relations', 'fourth', 'world', 'nations', 'countries', 'so', 'small', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'map', 'Sam', 'preparing', 'wedding', 'when', 'invisible', 'man', 'carrying', 'visible', 'sphere', 'vials', 'assasinated', 'presence', 'resulting', 'chaos', 'Sam', 'accidentally', 'invisibility', 'potion', 'thus', 'becoming', 'invisible', 'also', 'up', 'remaining', 'vials', 'attempts', 'track', 'Sam', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'friends', 'enemies', 'actually', 'had', 'consult', 'article', 'movie', 'get', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'so', 'confused', 'when', 'saw', 'theatre', 'dozed', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'end', 'credits', 'were', 'favorite', 'part', 'humor', 'plot', 'devices', 'pace', 'movie', 'are', 'strained', 'forced', 'attempts', 'humor', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'what', 'plot', 'so', 'disjointed', 'make', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'follow', 'nobody', 'movie', 'good', 'performance', 'was', 'bad', 'theatre', 'frankly', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'now', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'worse', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'video', 'when', 'take', 'out', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', '3-D', 'effects', 'movie', 'only', 'recommendable', 'worst', 'enemy-Bob']",Man Who Wasn't There VHS
